<song artist="Nobuo_Uematsu" title="Love_Will_Grow">
Love will grow, and nothing comes in the way,
It's true that love is here to stay;
All we have to do is to face tomorrow.
Love will grow; there's no need to run and hide,
It's true we've always been so slow--
Should I tell you now what's been burning inside?
Darling, strange days are over,
Fears and tears, they're all gone.
This is the very beginning--
Now, the world is meant for you and me.
Love will grow; there's one thing I'm sure of now:
I know that we'll get no more sighs,
Love is to us true-blue, and there's no sorrow.
Love will grow; come what may, we'll never part.
Let's hold on tight to dreams of ours,
Even though we've still got a long way to go...
Darling, strange days are over,
Fears and tears, they're all gone.
This is the very beginning--
Now, the world is meant for you and me.
See how the day has just broken,
Oh, so fresh from the world
See how the brand new sun's coming up--
Let it now...shine on me!
Shine on you...shine on me!
Love will grow, and nothing comes in the way,
It's true that love is here to stay;
All we have to do is to face tomorrow!
