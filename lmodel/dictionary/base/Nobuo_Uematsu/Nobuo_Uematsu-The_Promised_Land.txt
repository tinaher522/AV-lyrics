<song artist="Nobuo_Uematsu" title="The_Promised_Land">
Now here I stand
Oh, in the morning sunshine,
Dreaming only of the promised land.
Somewhere, they say, beyond the great horizon,
Lies a beautiful island.
Everyone says he longs at heart for Shangri-La,
But that it's a nowhere-land, after all.
How I wonder why no one tries to sail out,
Looking for a strange paradise.
In my dreams, I've seen people there,
Exchanging words of love and care.
In the bright sunbeams, they're dancing with the birds
And they're singing all day long beside the streams.
One day, someday,
You'll surely find me sailing away
For the white beach of the promised land.

Now here we stand
Oh, in the burning sunset,
Talking only of the promised land.
I'm glad to know now I am not the only one--
I've got nice friends who share dreams with me.
We are so young; we've got some magic powers.
We are nourishing like flowers.
Oh, let us wait until the day comes when we will all
Sail across the deeper blue sea.
In our dreams, we've seen people there,
Exchanging words of love and care.
In the bright sunbeams, they're dancing with the birds
And they're singing all day long beside the streams.
One day, someday,
You'll surely find us sailing away
For the white beach of the promised land.
