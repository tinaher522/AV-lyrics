<song artist="Nobuo_Uematsu" title="Once_You_Meet_Her">
And no one knows it--
Where she came from, where she's going.
And once you meet her,
You will find that something inside is changing.
She's like a rainbow--
When she comes up, all are lit up.
And when she whispers,
You will hear this: "Don't chase after rainbows."
High on a hill, there's a green meadow.
All around, it's breezin',
She's smilin',
She'll let them sing angel songs.
She's like a fairy
When she's trembling, when she's dancing.
Just see her rambling--
How it's nice to follow her to the end.
You want some meanings of the life,
And go to see her.
Don't ask her too much--
Oh yes, she'll be out of your sight
Right over.
High on a hill, there's a green meadow.
All around, it's breezin',
She's smilin',
She'll let them sing angel songs.
Everyone is sad and blue when she is far away.
Don't you know it's time to pray she'll be coming soon?
And you think you hear her voice ringing from above.
And no one knows it--
Where she came from, where she's going.
And once you meet her,
Maybe you'll stay forever young.
