<song artist="Nobuo_Uematsu" title="Otherworld">
Go on, if you want it
An otherworld awaits you
Don't you give up on it
You bite the hand that feeds you
All alone, cold fields you wander
Memories of it, cloud your sight
Fills your dreams, disturbs your slumber
Lost your way, a fallen knight...
Hold now, aim is steady
An otherworld awaits you
One thousand years -- you ready?
The otherworld it takes you
Go into the sand and the dust in the sky. Go now, there's no better plan than to do or to die. Free me, pray to the fayth, in the face of the light. Feed me, fill me with sin, and get ready to fight
You know you will, you know you will
You know, you know, you know
You know that you will
You know, you know, you know
You know that you will
You know you will
Fight, fight, fight
Fight, fight, fight
Fight, fight, fight
Fight, fight, fight
Hope dies and you wander
The otherworld it makes you
Dreams, they rip asunder
The otherworld it hates you
Free now, ride up on it
Up to the heights it takes you
Go on, if you want it
An otherworld awaits you
