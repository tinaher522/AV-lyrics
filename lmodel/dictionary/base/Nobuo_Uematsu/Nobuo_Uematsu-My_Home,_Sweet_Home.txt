<song artist="Nobuo_Uematsu" title="My_Home,_Sweet_Home">
So far away from my home, sweet home
Day by day, from land to land I roam.
Though told by the wind, which way to go.
Oh how I long for my home, sweet home.
Boađe ruoktot alot go
don dovtat tuski
Boađe ruoktot alot go
don dovtat váivu
du ruoktu vuordá
du alot
du ruoktu vuordá
du alot
Fragrant blossoms, blooming far away
Do my folks see them as I did long ago?
Are they still joyful, are they young at heart?
Will I see them again as I did that day…
(sang simultaneously with 2nd English stanza)
Bearaš, ushbat, ruoktu
muitut
dat eai goassige
vajaldahtc du
How far I've come from my childhood home…
There will come a time when my troubles are gone
And when I shall not be all alone.
Till then, I dream of my home, sweet home.
(sang simultaneously with 3rd English stanza)
Meahcci, čácit, albmi
eana
dat buot vurdet du
dat buot vurdet du
