<song artist="Nobuo_Uematsu" title="Have_You_Ever_Seen_Me?">
Have you ever seen me singing in the sunshine
One lovely afternoon?
You can near me if you really want
You can hear me clear pretty soon
Have you ever seen me singing in the sunshine
One lovely afternoon?
Sing it loud so you can feel fine--
Let us sing forever and a day!
Here, deep in the forest,
Forgive and forget
See, everything is new
Here deep in the forest
Forget 'bout trifles hurting you!
Why don't you let 'em go away?
(Shall we sing? Shall we sing?
No one's watching!)
Why don't you all together stay?
(In the forest you can have a lot of...fun!)
Have you ever seen me playing in the shade of
One lovely apple tree?
You can find me if you really want
Come and join me. You're gonna be free!
Have you ever seen me playing in the shade of
One lovely apple tree?
We are friends and never disagree--
Let us play forever and a day!
(refrain)
Why don't you let 'em go away?
(Shall we play? Shall we play?
Please don't delay!)
Why don't you all together stay?
(In the forest you can have a lot of...fun!)
Why don't you let 'em go away?
(Shall we dance? Shall we dance?
Take a good chance!)
Why don't you all together stay?
(In the forest you can have a lot of...fun!)
