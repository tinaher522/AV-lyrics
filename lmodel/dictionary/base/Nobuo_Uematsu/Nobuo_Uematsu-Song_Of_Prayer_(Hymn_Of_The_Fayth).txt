<song artist="Nobuo_Uematsu" title="Song_Of_Prayer_(Hymn_Of_The_Fayth)">
The original lyrics to the Song of Prayer are as follows:
Ieyui
Nobomeno
Renmiri
Yojuyogo
Hasatekanae
Kutamae

This can be translated by rearranging the syllables. Take the first four words and rearrange the syllables vertically.
i 	no	re	yo
e 	bo	n 	ju
yu	me	mi	yo
i 	no	ri	go
Pray Saviour
Dream Child of Prayer

Arrange the last two words into a rectangle and an L, respectively.
ha	te	na
sa	ka	e
ku
ta	ma	e
Forever and ever
Bring us peace

This gives us the "real lyrics" to the Song of Prayer:
Inore yo, Ebonju
Yume mi yo, inorigo
Hatenaku
Sakaetamae
Pray to Yu Yevon
Dream, fayth
Forever and ever,
grant us prosperity
