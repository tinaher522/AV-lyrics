<song artist="Jamie_Xx" title="Far_Nearer">
I feel better when I, you feel better when I
I feel better when I have you near me
I feel better when I, you feel better when I
I feel better when I have you near me
I feel better when I, you feel better when I
I feel better when I have you near me
I feel better when I, you feel better when I
I feel better when I have you near me
I feel better when I, you feel better
I feel better when I have you near me
I feel better when I, you feel better when I
I feel better when I have you near me
I feel better when I, you feel better when I
I feel better when I have you near me
I feel better when I, you feel better when I
I feel better when I have you near me
You, me, you, I do, I do, I do
You, me, you, you, me, you, you
I feel better, you feel better, I feel better
I feel better when I, you feel better when I, I feel better
I feel better when I, you feel better when I
I feel better when I have you near me
I feel better when I, you feel better when I
I feel better when I have you near me
I feel better when I, you feel better when I
I feel better when I have you near me
I feel better when I, you feel better when I
I feel better when I have you near me
You, me, you
You, me, you, you
