<song artist="Jamie_Xx" title="Stranger_In_A_Room">
You wanna disappear in a crowd
Just a stranger in a room
Wanna change your colors just for the night
With no word of it following you
No word of it following you
No word of it following you
No word of it
You're just a stranger in a room
You're just a stranger in a room
Tonight I felt for it at night
For someone I wanted to know
Cause here under the blue lights
There's always someone I've wanted to know
With no way of it walking back home
No way of it walking back home
No way of it walking back home
No way of it
And I don't wanna waste my time
On in a familiar ride
Been looking in from the outside
I come in
Room, room, room
You're just a stranger in a room
Room, room, room
You're just a stranger in a room
