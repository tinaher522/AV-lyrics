<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="Sanity">
There's a watch in my pocket
And its hands are broken
The face is blank
But the gears are turning
Confusion
Is a fundamental state of mind
It doesn't really matter what I'm figuring out
I'm guaranteed to wind up in a state of doubt
And sanity is a full time job
In a world that is always changing
And sanity is a state of mind
That you believe in sanity
There's a shadow on the wall
Where the paint is peeling
My body's moving forward
But my mind is reeling
Depression
Is a fundamental state of day
It doesn't really matter how my day has turned out
I always end up living in this world of doubt
And sanity is a full time job
In a world that is always changing
And sanity will make you strong
If you believe in sanity
And sanity is a full time job
In a world that is always changing
And sanity is a state of mind
That you believe in sanity
