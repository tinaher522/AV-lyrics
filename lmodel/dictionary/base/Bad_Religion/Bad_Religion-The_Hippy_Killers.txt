<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="The_Hippy_Killers">
Our apocalypse 1981
Teenage vagrants looking for some fun
A renewed promise of prosperity
A vulgar platform for the world to see
We were the hippy killers
The hippy killers
The hippy killers
The hippy killers
Busted refuse from broken homes
Pocked flesh and malicious bones
Creatures sustained by desire, heart and soul
Nothing to leave and nowhere to go
We were the hippy killers
The hippy killers
The hippy killers
The hippy killers
Good days during horrible times
Overused bodies, neglected minds
Shoulder to shoulder we formed as one
The next miserable generation
We were the hippy killers
The hippy killers
The hippy killers
The hippy killers
