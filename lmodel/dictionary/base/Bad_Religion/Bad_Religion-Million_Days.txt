<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="Million_Days">
When you're sitting alone
Frown and groan
Over your bad day
When you're laughing with peers
Forget your years
Then be on your way
But don't forget, all the while
That you've crossed the social mile
And a million days is worth one good laugh
But don't forget, all the while
That you've passed the social mile
And a million days is worth one good laugh
