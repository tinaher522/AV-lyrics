<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="Heaven_Is_Falling">
As I walk beneath the valley
I shall fear no evil
'Cause thanks to King George and his rainbow cabinet
Today murder is legal
God, I know that it's wrong
To kill my brother for what he hasn't done
And as the planes blacken the sky
It sounds like heaven is falling
It sounds like heaven is falling
You promise me a new day a-dawning
I see a thousand points of light
Like so many points of hatred, shame, and horror
God, I want to be a man
But I don't want to die with a rifle in my hand
And as the planes blacken the sky
It sounds like heaven is falling
It sounds like heaven is falling
You promise me a new day a-dawning
Well, nothing here looks new to me
But a score of mothers' sons caught between the devil and the deep blue sea
