<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="Where_The_Fun_Is">
Smacked back tarmac stars are scars of fame
In the place where no one knows me by my name
Where tar pit drips its drilled out vein
And fashion trips on tangled skein
If you need to slake that aching in your brain
This is where the fun is
This is where the fun is
In the shadow of the valley
Where the nights are warm
We will fear no evil
When we get things done
Tap in - into the vein
We'll road trip and raise Cain
Down on the nickel
With a flame in the rain
This is where the fun is
This is where the fun is
This is where the fun is
This is where the fun is
So jump in - into the frame
We're laughin' to hide the pain
It's not a riddle we're all a little, a little amazed
This is where the fun is
This is where the fun is
This is where the fun is
This is where the fun is
This is where the fun is
This is where the fun is
This is where the fun is
This is where the fun is
