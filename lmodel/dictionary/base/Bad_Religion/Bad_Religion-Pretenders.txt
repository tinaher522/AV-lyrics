<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="Pretenders">
I give to you, you take from me
We live in perfect harmony
But I know you can't give me what I need
Wwith subtle care and rosey hues
We duke it out, we change our views
We hold so dear our unanimity
Oh...
We are just pretenders
We are just pretenders, lost in this charade
We are just pretenders, characters on stage
We are just pretenders, trying to break free
We are just pretenders, hiding so no one sees
We try to find our peace of mind
Just a vestige we left behind
But ignorance takes far less energy
And if you please, I'll look to you
Because I need somebody who
Forgives me for my harsh reality
Oh...but
We are just pretenders
We are just pretenders, we're trying to break free

We are just pretenders, we'll lose them easily
We are just pretenders, trying to break free
We are just pretenders, hiding so no one sees
You standing there
Playing with your hair
Trying to ignore
But peeking in the mirror
Re-living the scenes
From books and magazines
Craving the life
You live in your dreams
And I'm standing here
Thinking that it's queer
But fearing that I am the same
You ask me how I feel
It's so damn surreal
I think it's finally time we ended this game
'cause we are just pretenders
We are just pretenders, lost in this charade
We are just pretenders...
