<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="Voice_Of_God_Is_Government">
Neighbors, no one loves you like he loves you
And no one cares like he cares
Neighbors, let us join today in the holy love of God and money
Because neighbors, no one loves you like he loves you
And what better way to show your love than to dig deep into your pockets
Dig real deep, until it hurts
Alleviate your guilt
Free yourself once again, because he gave to you, brothers and sisters
Please give a 10, 25, or a 50 dollar tax-deductible donation
And I assure you your modest pledge will be used to censor TV and radio
Ban questionable books, and contribute to many other godly services
No longer will young Christian Americans hedonistically indulge in masochistic submission
To rhythmic music, for with your monetary support
There is no end to what we can achieve in this country
The voice of god is government
The voice of god is government
The voice of god is government
In God we trust, sinners repent!
Can't you see what we believe in, all our thoughts and all our reasons
Pursuit of life and liberty and happiness we cannot see?
Speak of truth with a mighty voice, but politics are your real choice
Hire men to change the law, protect and serve with one small flaw
The voice of god is government
The voice of god is government
The voice of god is government
In God we trust, sinners repent!
If we shun God and Jesus Christ, religious love is sacrifice
Love for God is shown in cash, the love they send is mailbox trash
With every pamphlet we receive, more money asked for godly needs
Build a million dollar church, with money spent on God's research
The voice of god is government
The voice of god is government
The voice of god is government
In God we trust, sinners repent!
On late night TV, God can heal, a certain force you cannot feel
Love for money in God's name, religion's now a TV game!
Build a million dollar church, with money spent on god's research (2x)
The voice of god is government
The voice of god is government
The voice of god is government
In God we trust, sinners repent!
Yeah!
The voice of god is government
The voice of god is government
The voice of god is government
In God we trust, sinners repent!
