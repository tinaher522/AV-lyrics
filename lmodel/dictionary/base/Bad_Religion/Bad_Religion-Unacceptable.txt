<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="Unacceptable">
Irreducible is the word for today
Plastic compounds and nuclear waste
What the hell's the matter with the people on this planet, have we all gone insane?
The stigma of industrial progress killing us over and over again
It's one part per trillion, unacceptable
One part per billion, unacceptable
One part per million, unacceptable
This mammoth pogrom set upon us courtesy of the USA
Inexcusable are the men before our time
I'd like to kick their ass for what they left behind
Cancer-causing chemicals, ozone-depleting aerosols, we're all going to fry
So put your head between your legs and kiss your ass goodbye
One part per trillion, unacceptable
One part per billion, unacceptable
One part per million, unacceptable
One part per trillion, unacceptable
One part per billion, unacceptable
One part per million, unacceptable
Unac-fucking-ceptable!
