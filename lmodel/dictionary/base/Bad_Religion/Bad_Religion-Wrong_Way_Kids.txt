<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="Wrong_Way_Kids">
Stop them from shimmering away
On blank sidewalk glittering asphalt somewhere summer days
The wrong way kids were something more than friends
Navigating a sprawl without end
Did you ever want to take bad advice
Did you ever want to go and take it twice
Do you remember when the world began to put up its thorny fence
Right, you are my friend
So what’s wrong with them
There go the wrong way kids
Singing whoa oh whoa oh whoa oh ohhhh
Singing whoa oh whoa oh whoa oh ohhhh
Whoa oh whoa oh whoa oh ohhhh
And they call them the wrong way kids
The kids today are gone away petitioning the dust
With noone to look up to because they're looking up to us
Just misfit melancholy dregs gone lost in the mall
Wanderers to nowhere at all
Did you ever want to take bad advice
Did you ever want to go and take it twice
Do you remember when the world began to put up its thorny fence
Right, you are my friend
So what’s wrong with them
There go the wrong way kids
Singing whoa oh whoa oh whoa oh ohhhh
Singing whoa oh whoa oh whoa oh ohhhh
Whoa oh whoa oh whoa oh ohhhh
And they call them the wrong way kids
