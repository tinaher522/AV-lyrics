<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="The_Same_Person">
You want prosperity
For yourself but not for me
Somehow you just can't see
We're in this collectively
You think that freedom is
A drastic severance
From your past relations
Just a quest for new bargains
We're not the same person
We're not the same person
Don't even wanna know
Don't need no good advice
Nor shoddy merchandise
I'm the suspect device
Beaten down, unable to strike
We're not the same person
We're not the same person
Don't really wanna know
And the sun comes over us again
We lament, we pine and we rescind
And we ask for understanding but aren't we the stingy ones indeed?
When it's needed from us in the end
We watch the days go by
Compete and then we die
So few ever ask why
But so many just abuse the design
We're not the same person
We're not the same person
Don't even wanna know
We're not the same person
We're not the same person
Don't even wanna know
