<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="The_Day_That_The_Earth_Stalled">
Do you remember when we were young, adventure had no end?
Those were the days my friend
But I'm not talking about that at all
Do you remember when you marred my future with a sickly parasitic pall?
That was the day that the earth stalled
That was the day the earth stalled
On the day the earth stalled
Friction, bonds, and gravity, all harmonic motion ceased
Life itself could not maintain from that singularity
Try to withstand a magnetic storm with no one to keep you warm
Waiting for the rest to fall, since the day that the earth stalled
That was the day the earth stalled
Since the day that the earth stalled
On that day that the earth stalled
That was the day the earth stalled
On that day that the earth stalled
