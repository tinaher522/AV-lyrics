<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="Eat_Your_Dog">
Weak and sick, dying in the sand
No such thing as a promised land
Don't lose faith in a better life
Reincarnation, poor excuse
You're dying you assholes, your religion can't help you now
Dying and starving in the fields you used to plow
Rotting bones in your barren fields
Worshipped creature's supposed to heal
He won't save you and he won't save me
See what you want to see
Hindu religion in the mind of a working Joe
Starving and dying in the fields you used to know
You're tied and bound to a God's useless advice
Bloated stomachs from aching diseases hold back the fight
In the end you'll return once more to die again
Go on till you can't no more in non-eternal sin
