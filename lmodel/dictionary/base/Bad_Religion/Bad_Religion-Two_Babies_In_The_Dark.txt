<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="Two_Babies_In_The_Dark">
There's a light on in the hallway, so I can't understand
Why you hide underneath the cover
There's a baby in your womb, so don't be scared tonight
'Cause Raggedy Ann is in the closet picking posies
Two babies in the dark, like diamonds in the sand
While Papa's far away making up children's stories
The little ones inside, so afraid to be alone
She's tired of being brave until the daddy comes home
So if you chance to see her, please tell her it's alright
'Cause everyone fights the tendency to snap sometimes
It's not a matter of being brave and strong
'Cause noises in the house are terrifying
Two babies in the dark, like diamonds in the sand
While Papa's far away making up children's stories
The little ones inside, so afraid to be alone
She's talking to herself now 'cause no one's home
I'll put you to sleep at night like a foreign movie
I'll sing you lullabies and I'll teach you about everything
And I'll only ask one thing
Please save me
