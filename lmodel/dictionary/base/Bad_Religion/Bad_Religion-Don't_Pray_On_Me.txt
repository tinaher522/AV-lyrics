<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="Don't_Pray_On_Me">
A grizzly scene on my electron beam told a story about human rights
So all the king's horses and all the king's men had a riot for two days and nights
Well the city exploded but the gates wouldn't open so the company asked him to quit
Now everybody's equal, just don't measure it
Well Hanson did it to Hester and Mark David did it to John
And maybe Jack did it to Marilyn, but he did it to South Vietnam
For beauty and glory, for money, love and country
Now everybody's doing it, don't do that to me
A bitter debate and a feminine fate lie in tandem like two precious babes
While the former gets warmer, it's the latter that matters, except on the nation's airwaves
And custodians of public opinion state facts after vainly discussing her rights
Lay hands off her body, it's not your fucking life
Now I don't know what stopped Jesus Christ from turning every hungry stone into bread
And I don't remember hearing how Moses reacted when the innocent firstborn sons lay dead
Well I guess God was a lot more demonstrative back when he flamboyantly parted the sea
Now everybody's praying, don't prey on me
Said everybody's praying, don't prey on me
