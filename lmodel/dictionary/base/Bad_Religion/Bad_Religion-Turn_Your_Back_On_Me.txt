<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="Turn_Your_Back_On_Me">
I've been searching for so long
Now the search party is gone
Won't somebody tell me what the hell went wrong
We started out so strong
I never wanted to hurt you
I didn't plan to desert you
I couldn't possibly express how much I care
So turn your back on me
Come on turn your back on me
To survive turn your back on me
We're the same as far as I can see
So come on turn your back on me
If I could I would stand outside myself
And pretend that I was looking back at somebody else
If I could do it again would I merely defend it all to the end?
Or do the ends justify themselves?
I never wanted to hurt you
I didn't plan to desert you
I couldn't possibly express how much I care
So turn your back on me
Come on turn your back on me
To survive turn your back on me
We're the same as far as I can see
So come on turn your back on me
