<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="Modern_Day_Catastrophists">
Take those potatoes out of your ears
Listen to the warnings, verify all your fears
There's a world outside that's ready to blow
And we're all to blame when it finally explodes
You gotta listen up
Gotta listen to what they're saying to you
Gotta listen up
And think about what they're telling you
Temperature is rising but the odorous way
Will bury us alive in what we throw away
If we don't reuse most of our debris
Our kids can't go with a carbon copy
You gotta listen up
Gotta listen to what I'm telling you
Gotta listen up
And think about what I'm saying to you
They're the modern day catastrophists
They've got practical solutions
They're the self-appointed righteous pragmatists
And they know fifty ways to save the world
What makes you think you can cure our disease?
Maybe it's just our biology
Maybe it's time to make room for another species
This is the 21st century
You gotta listen up
Gotta think about what they're saying to you
Gotta listen up
And think about what they're telling you
They're the modern day catastrophists
They've know all the right equations
They're the self-appointed righteous pragmatists
And you too can be one of the few to save the world
But you gotta listen up
Gotta think about what they're telling you
Gotta listen up
And do exactly what they tell you to
They're the modern day catastrophists
Modern day catastrophists
Modern day catastrophists
Modern day catastrophists
