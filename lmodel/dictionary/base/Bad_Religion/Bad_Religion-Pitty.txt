<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="Pitty">
I show pity on the human race
On the ignorant plenty who devote their lives
To an icon that they've never known
I show pity on eons past
When early man started the first civilization
And human aggression was born
I show pity on the future to come
When the government system will be omnipotent
And we'll be worse off
Than we are now
Pity, pity, on the billions of ignorant people
Pity, pity, on the masses of aggression
Pity, pity, on the future centuries to come
On the billions of ignorant people
On the future centuries to come
On the masses of aggression
It's all a matter of looking at the past
It's all a question, are we gonna last?
If we endure the aggression that's inside all of us
We'll wipe out our own species and thus
The world
Pity
Pity on
On the masses of aggression
On the billions of ignorant people
On the future centuries to come
On the masses of ignorant people
On the future centuries to come
