<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="I_Won't_Say_Anything">
He looked just like a zookeeper in a human zoo
So I said hey man how the hell did they get to you
Don't you know us animals need something to do
Then I flew
That's when he said
Hey, I can't deny it, but I won't say anything
Hey, I can't deny it, but I won't say anything
Hey, I can't deny it, but I won’t say anything
Unless you ask it right
So I took my mean machine to the sacramental post
Some kid had spilled his wine on the holiest host
And I said ain’t it funny that machines need a ghost
He made a toast
Hey, I can't deny it, but I won't say anything
Hey, I can't deny it, but I won't say anything
Hey, I can't deny it, but I won’t say anything
Unless you ask it right
Riding to the cemetery in a righteous limousine
I plied the grim proprietor with milk and tangerines
And I said so you're short but are you brutish and mean
Then he screamed
That's when he said
Hey, I can't deny it, but I won't say anything
Hey, I can't deny it, but I won't say anything
Hey, I can't deny it, but I won’t say anything
Unless you ask it right
