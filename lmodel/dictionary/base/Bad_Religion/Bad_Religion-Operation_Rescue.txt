<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="Operation_Rescue">
It's an S.O.S. sent out telepathically
Signs of our distress don't allow complacency
We need restoration now of our integrity
And a drastic bold reminder of our morality
The rectifying troop is here
The ones we've needed all these years
To stop the heinous wrongdoings
And verify our moral benevolence as a people
Operation, Operation Rescue
They're here to right our fall, they've heard our troubled call
Operation, Operation Rescue
You wonder where they come from but I just wonder why they're here at all
Life ever-after is what they're in business for
See them brandish the key to our kingdom's door
It's pervasive, a part of, part of you and me
But not overwhelming as they wish it to be
If no one believed in fairy tales
There's nothing they could do but fail
Yet everywhere we look
Someone is trying to reassure our moral benevolence as a people
Operation, Operation Rescue
They're here to right our fall, they've heard someone's troubled call
Operation, Operation Rescue
You wonder where they come from but I just wonder what compels them all
Operation, Operation Rescue
Operation, Operation Rescue
You may wonder where they come from
But I just wonder what compels them all
