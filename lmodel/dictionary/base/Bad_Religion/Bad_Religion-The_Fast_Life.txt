<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="The_Fast_Life">
The silent stray inertia, no burden on my back
No determinance, no ballast, no chance of looking back
It doesn't matter what's ahead, in time I'll hit it hard
No fixing my position, no sign of retard
It's the fast life, there's nothing I can do
The fast life, suck it in and follow through
The fast life, just learning as I go
You might call it careless but this fast life is all I've ever known
Like a wispy feather defying gravity
Or a rolling cobble in the middle of the stream
Propelled by a ghost force that never shows its face
Increase the ante of this perpetual pace
It's the fast life, there's nothing I can do
The fast life, suck it in and follow through
The fast life, just learning as I go
You might call it careless but this fast life is all I've ever known
Ever since the day I came out of the womb
My head was always bouncing off the walls in the room
Always scratching gravel, covering new ground
No matter how hard they tried they couldn't pin me down
It's the fast life, there's nothing I can do
The fast life, suck it in and follow through
The fast life, just learning as I go
You might call it careless but this fast life is all I've ever known
