<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="I_Love_My_Computer">
I love my computer, you make me feel alright
Every waking hour and every lonely night
I love my computer for all you give to me
Predictable errors and no identity
And it's never been quite so easy
I've never been quite so happy
All I need to do is click on you
And we'll be joined in the most soulless way
And we'll never ruin each others' day
'Cause when I'm through I just click and you just go away
I love my computer, you're always in the mood
I get so turned on when I turn on you
I love my computer, you never ask for more
You can be a princess or you can be my whore
And it's never been quite so easy
I've never been quite so happy
All I need to do is click on you
And we'll be joined in the most soulless way
And we'll never ruin each others' day
'Cause when I'm through I just click and you just go away
The world outside's so big but I'm safe in my domain
'Cause to you I'm just a number and a clever screen name
All I need to do is click on you
And we'll be together for eternity
And no one's ever gonna take my love from me
'Cause I've got security, her password and a key
Go away
Go away
Go away
Go away
