<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="Politics">
Economy, technology, doesn't really work
Can't try running for government, I'm not a jerk!
I've tried to see these faces all around the way
You're lucky if they listen to a single word you say
What is right and what is wrong? The government decides
You don't have no rights at all, as long as you don't fight
We're all being oppressed by the upper middle class
The government you vote for is the one that you put there
I've put down enough dues, I'm due and so are you
Residents fear the president, I'm not the government
We ignore the masses of the whole entire race
Then our streets will all get filled without a happy face
Economy, technology, doesn't really work
The guy running the government, another jerk
I've tried to see these faces all around the way
You're lucky if they listen to a single word you say
