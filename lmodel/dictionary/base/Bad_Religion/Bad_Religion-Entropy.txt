<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="Entropy">
Random blobs of power expressed as that which we all disregard
Ordered states of nature on a scale which no one thinks about
Don't speak to me of anarchy or peace or calm revolt, man
We're in a play of slow decay orchestrated by Boltzmann
It's entropy, it's not a human issue
Entropy, it's matter of course
Entropy, energy at all levels
Entropy, from it you can not divorce
And your pathetic moans of suffrage tend to lose all significance
Extinction, degradation, the natural outcomes of our ordered lives
Power, motivation, temporary fixtures for which we strive
Something in our synapses assures us we're okay
But in our disequilibrium we simply cannot stay
It's entropy, it's not a human issue
Entropy, it's matter of course
Entropy, energy at all levels
Entropy, from it you can not divorce
A stolid proposition from a man unkempt as I
My affectatious nature I can't rectify
But we are out of equilibrium unnaturally
A pang of consciousness of death and then you will agree
It's entropy
Entropy, it's matter of course
Entropy, energy at all levels
Entropy, from it you can not divorce
Entropy
Entropy
Entropy
Entropy
