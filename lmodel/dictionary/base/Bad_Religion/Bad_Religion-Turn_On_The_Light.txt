<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="Turn_On_The_Light">
I had a friend who kept a candle in his pocket
He used to touch it when the wind was blowing high
I guess it made him feel like he could buck the system
And when it flickered out we laid him down to die
Turn on the light
Turn on a million blinding brilliant white incendiary lights
A beacon in the night
I'll burn relentlessly until my juice runs dry
And I'll construct a rack of tempered beams and trusses
And equip it with a million tiny suns
I'll install upon the roof of my compartment
And place tinfoil on my floor and on my walls
Then I'll turn on the light
Turn on a million blinding brilliant white incendiary lights
A beacon in the night
I'll burn relentlessly until my juice runs dry
And I'll burn like a roman fucking candle
Burn like a chasm in the night
Burn for a miniscule duration
Ecstatic immolation, incorrigible delight
