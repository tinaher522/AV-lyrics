<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="1,000_Memories">
You were the one, you were my everything
Never apart, no one in-between
Then one day, when you went your own way
You felt justified, and I was mortified
But today...
You are just a picture
And a thousand memories is all I take with me
'Cause your smile is just too much to see
You're just a thousand memories
Fantasies, broken dreams
Reveries, sordid histories
Following my heart, laden with reaction, without calibration or design
Comitted to a trial, a life of understanding
Can't somebody show a sign to you?
For me, to see if you only knew
That you were the one...
(first verse)
'Cause a picture is worth a thousand memories
