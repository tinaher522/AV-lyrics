<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="Let_It_Burn">
Let your mind wander, look beyond the shadows
Focus on the skyline, read the silhouettes
Your deepest desires are a picture of tomorrow
All your darkest fears are just a vestige of regret
And it's whoooa
It seems like such a long way to go
As obstacles get bigger, prevailing winds blow stronger
And the fire continues to grow
Don't let shallow water limit your perception
Heed the new horizon, muster to it fast
The moments your yesterdays are in the wake behind you
Can't assess the future if you're living in the past
And it's whoooa
It seems like such a long way to go
As obstacles get bigger, prevailing winds blow stronger
And the fire continues to grow
The fire continues to grow
Keep it stoked
If you are committed to a life of understanding
Then there's no agenda for vengeance in your life
Sharpen all your senses, face the opposition
You can overcome with fortitude and mental might
And it's whoooa
It seems like such a long way to go
As obstacles get bigger, prevailing winds blow stronger
And the fire continues to grow
The fire continues to grow
The fire continues to grow in your soul
So be bold, let it grow
Don't let it die, let it burn
