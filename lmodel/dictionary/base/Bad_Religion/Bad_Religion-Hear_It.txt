<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="Hear_It">
Like a morning crow and his unwelcome song
Or a worn-out broken record that keeps skipping along
Mountains of instructions you keep piling on me
Resound like a cacophonous symphony
But I don't wanna hear it anymore
No, I don't wanna hear it anymore
Priests and politicians pretend they're your friend
And police speak to you like you're children again
Blanket statements cover you like a rug
And they tell me maybe I'm acting a little too smug
But I don't wanna hear it anymore
No, I don't wanna hear it anymore
No more!
Every day we hear the secrets of life
Reduced to cheap jokes, poetry and friendly advice
They'd rather see us all pusillanimous
Absorbent in their chorus of correctness
But I don't wanna hear it anymore
No, I don't wanna hear it anymore
I said I don't wanna hear it anymore
No, I don't wanna hear it anymore
