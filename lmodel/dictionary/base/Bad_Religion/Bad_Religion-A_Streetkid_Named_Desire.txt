<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="A_Streetkid_Named_Desire">
Well, it was punk:15 in the morning
And it was time to stand my ground
And as the gawks and the stares bombarded me
You know I didn't even hear a sound
No one gave a damn if I was there or away
If I died and went to hell they'd throw a party on my grave
And they'd all say "this kid is just a fool
He'll never be cool"
They might as well just ship him off to some other school
Plain destitute
Just a little too guilty
Just a little too soon
But that day was just like any other day, no work and no pay
I knew that paradise was some other place and I'd get there another day
I will find it before I expire 'cause I've got the desire
Well, it was punk:15 in the evening
And it was time to set the town on fire
I saw my boots and my hair as reflected in the mirror
Reveal a street kid named desire
I didn't give a damn, I was just dying to be
And as the Hollywood street scene left its mark on me
I changed from a boy into a man
I said never again
I stuck out my chin when I should have ran
Shit in the fan
I was driven so hard
By the sound of my heart
But that day was just like any other day, no work and no pay
I knew that paradise was some other place and I'd get there another day
I will find it before I expire 'cause I've got the desire
When the walls surround in deeper shades of blue
And there's no voice of reason inside you
And you search for meaning on an empty shelf
Then you're always dreaming of somewhere else
Today is just like any other day, no fear, no restraint
I know that paradise is some other place and I'll get there another day
You can come with me, no conditions or fares, somehow, somewhere
I will find it before I expire 'cause I've got the desire
