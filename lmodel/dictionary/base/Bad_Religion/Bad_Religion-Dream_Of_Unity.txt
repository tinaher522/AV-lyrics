<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="Dream_Of_Unity">
I had a dream of unity 
Where we would work side by side
But today I see that it's only me 
Just trying to get by
Sometimes we strive undeterred
To walk as one toward our goal 
But as people stray towards more selfish ways
We see we have no control
I had a dream of unity
Where we would work side by side
But today I see that it's only me
Just tryin' to get by just tryin' to get by
