<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="Believe_It">
It could happen to you, a defect
From the wasted outskirts of Los Angeles with a crumpled up pass for the RTD
And no authority or trajectory
On the brink of insanity
You'd better believe it
'Cause it's written all over your face
Just a neighborhood reject, out of step and out of place
You'd better believe it
Would you ever have thought persistence
Could prevail against the almost unbearable weight of the system?
With nothing better to do
And no one else who you can look up to
You'd better believe it
'Cause it's written all over your face
Just a political defect, out of step and out of place
You'd better believe it
And the future's bright when ideas run astray
So turn out the lights, a punk can't have a say
Sometimes desire is all that's there
Who said life was fair?
Better believe it
You'd better believe it
'Cause it's written all over your face
Just a neighborhood reject, out of step and out of place
You'd better believe it
You gotta believe it
'Cause it's written all over your face
Just a political defect, out of step and out of place
You'd better believe it
You've gotta believe it
It's written all over your face
A subcultural reject, out of step and out of place
You'd better believe it, you gotta believe it
