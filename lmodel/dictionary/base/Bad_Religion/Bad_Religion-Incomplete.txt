<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="Incomplete">
Mother, father
Look at your little monster
I'm a hero, I'm a zero
I'm the butt of the worst joke in history
I'm a lock without a key, a city with no door
A prayer without faith, a show without a score
I'm a bad word, a wink, a nod, a shiver
An untold story, sex without purity, a creeping gray memory
I am incomplete
Incomplete
Incomplete
Incomplete
Doctor, cure me
What is the cause of my condition?
This madness shoots me
Like bullets smashing glass in a silent movie
I'm a trap without a spring, a temple with no god
A jack without an ace, the tip of your tongue
I'm a promise in an unmailed letter
An unbuilt motor, deck without a joker, a creeping gray memory
I am incomplete
Incomplete
Incomplete
Incomplete
Tell Saint Peter not to bet on me
I've got a naked obsession
A good intention gone bad
I am incomplete
Incomplete
Incomplete
Incomplete
