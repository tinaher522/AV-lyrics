<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="Land_Of_Competition">
Hey see, there's a girl
Who's afraid of the world so she stays at home
Also a boy
Who seems so lost in his joy, he's all alone
The camera's on them, they're in the land of competition
Southern California air feeds them
And they know they are best 'cause of the way they are dressed
But you can bet you are not welcome in their home
Hey see, there's a girl
Who sits and watches the world from her blue screen
Also a boy
Who truly wants to destroy his hometown scene
They both want to travel to the land of competition
Southern California will destroy them
And they won't be the best, they'll be the poseurs who dress
Like the plastic idiots who they copy
Tell me what do you need to make you happy?
Indeed, is it out of your reach?
Beware of number one
See all the damage it has done, there are so few of them
You won't find too many in the land of competition
Southern California doesn't breed them
If you just want the best turn to yourself for the rest
And forget about the ones who have it all
Be careful of the ones who have it all
Be careful of the ones who have it all
Forget about the ones who have it all
