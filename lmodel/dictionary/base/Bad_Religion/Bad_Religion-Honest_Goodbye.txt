<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="Honest_Goodbye">
Now get up and give in, I'll crack your knuckles again
Supplicate and survive this transubstantiation
And get so mean
I want to know what it means
Did you laugh? You know I did
Did you cry? Couldn't get it right
Did you live? Always on the edge
Did you lie? Causing such a fright
Did you love? Oh, to be forgiven
Did you try? But it wouldn't be right
God, it feels like an honest goodbye
That sick brass boy daydreaming, cry baby, convict, demon
Hands so clean, a sympathetic cold-blooded killing machine
How did you get so mean?
I want to know what it means
Did you laugh? You know I did
Did you cry? Couldn't get it right
Did you live? Always on the edge
Did you lie? Causing such a fright
Did you love? Oh, to be forgiven
Did you try? But it wouldn't be right
God, it feels like an honest goodbye
