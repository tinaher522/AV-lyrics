<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="Lookin'_In">
Suddenly it came to me
A potent dosage of reality
I saw myself in the broad daylight
And it made me think about life
I am not the kind of guy
Who nods his head with closed eyes
I scoff at labels, defy censuses
And despise group mentality
All along I thought that this was only human
But I know now that I'm in the minority
I'm lookin' in, lookin' in
Lookin' in, I'm lookin' in
Now I think in relation to
My fellow man and what he strives to do
We fail to see there's no compromise
Our evolution is our demise
One day you mind you're also one of me
A complex microcosm of the human race
Observing those around us, desiring to belong
Behind the guise of salvation we suffer all along the way
We're lookin' in, lookin' in
Lookin' in, we're lookin' in
Lookin' in, lookin' in
Lookin' in, we're lookin' in
