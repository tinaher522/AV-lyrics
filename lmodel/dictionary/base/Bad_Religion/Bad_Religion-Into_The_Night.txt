<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="Into_The_Night">
In the city, the day is too hot
And you're hoping for relief, 'cuz your head is filled with pain
But you get no relief, 'cuz the night is the same
In the night, into the night you see through jaded eyes
In the night, into the night you feel barely alive
You live your life in darkness, you've got pennies on your eyes
But you say that it's all right, 'cuz you've never lived a lie
As you crawl back to your womblike existence in the night
In the night, into the night you see through jaded eyes
In the night, into the night you feel barely alive
You can't see no light, but you hear those heavy footsteps
And the little man inside twists your tormented mind
Your mind is filled with shadows, your palms are wet with sweat
Limbs are bound and tangled in a fatal net
There are two things you can do, one is turn and fight
The other's run headlong into the night
In the night, into the night you see through jaded eyes
In the night, into the night you feel barely alive
You can't see no light, but you hear those heavy footsteps
And the breathing at your side, is it yours, or is it
Good-bye?
