<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="Joy_To_The_World">
Ladies and gentlements (hand clapings)of the comunity of angels
I'd like to share a little something we've done...
Joy to the world
The Lord is come
Let Earth receive her King
Let every heart
Prepare Him room
And Heaven and nature sing
And Heaven and nature sing
And Heaven
And Heaven and nature sing
He rules the world
With tooth and nail
And makes us follow him
They can't tell us why
They just fall in line
And he shall rule the world
And he shall rule the world 
And he shall
And he shall rule the world
He rules the world
I've said that before
And now i think i'm done
I can't remember anymore
Of this crazy song
But hey it's chrismas time
But hell it's chrismas time
And he he, and ho ho ho 
It's chrismas time
