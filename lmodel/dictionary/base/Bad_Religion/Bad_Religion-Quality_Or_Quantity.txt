<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="Quality_Or_Quantity">
Offer me eternity
And I'll trade a cup of coffee and a dime
Looking for a handout
On behalf of those who have so little time
But who wants to live on just 70 cents a day?
Padding your pockets doesn't make this a better place
Cereal and water is a feast for some, you say
Your price tag on existence can't cover your double face
Quality or quantity
Quality or quantity
Quality or quantity
A choice you have to make
Dipping in the icing
Bringing home the largest turkey from the field
Breaking all the piggy banks, scooping all the booty
Licking all the right holes, bolstering the payroll
Why reduce life to a dollar amount per day?
And why let the world think this is the American way?
Your uneaten greens are a feast for some you say
Survival and living are concepts you can't equate
Quality or quantity
Quality or quantity
Quality or quantity
Don't tell me they're the same
Quality or quantity
Quality or quantity
Quality or quantity
A choice you have to make
