<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="Latch_Key_Kids">
In this world today there ain't nobody to thank
Just blame it on the kids and toss 'em into the tank
And if they yell for justice we'll hide them from the light
So that when they learn the truth they won't be scared of the night
Put the key in the hole when you get home from school
I'll be home by 8:30, your father will too
If you cause any trouble then I don't want to see
Cause you'll go straight to bed and you won't have no TV
