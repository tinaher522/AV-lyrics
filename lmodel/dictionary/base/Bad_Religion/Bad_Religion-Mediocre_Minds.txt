<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="Mediocre_Minds">
Look around the country, an abundance you'll find
Of mediocre minds
Sift through the fodder as sane justice declines
Because of mediocre minds
Shrouded under cover, the most flamboyant guise
Hides a mediocre mind
You got yours but you can never bend
With your mediocre minds
When they cry foul you had better watch out
Because you never know which aptitude they're griping about
Don't act too smart for their stenoscopic ways
You'll be discarded away
Reason's not to be what the privileged define
With their mediocre minds
So many sighted people are so helplessly blind
From their mediocre minds
If you want attention then you'll be asked to bend
But the surest insurrection is enlightenment
Then you can live outside inharmoniously without friends
An enemy
They wanna keep me locked away
'Cause I've an overactive brain
Leaders, presidents and the nightly news guys
Cater to mediocre minds
Reason's not to be what the privileged define
With their mediocre minds
You got yours but you can never bend mine
With your mediocre minds
The only natural thing that I really despise
Are the mediocre minds
Mediocre minds
Mediocre minds
