<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="Chronophobia">
These rational delusions have got to cease
The second hand has finally got the best of me
I'm too aware about the singularity
That brought me to the edge of time
And it's always on my mind now
They say that what is past is coming back someday
The world is turning faster but it's just one way
And I'm desperate to try most anything to abate
A simple chronophobia
A simple chronophobia now
A simple chronophobia
A simple chronophobia now
Maybe there's a science or technology
To help me come to terms with my maker
Since natural selection never banked on me
I must be an exception to the plan
Someone help me understand now
Cryogenic methods are intractable
And collagen polymers aren't so terrible
But they still can't prevent the inevitable farewell
A simple chronophobia
A simple chronophobia now
A simple chronophobia
A simple chronophobia now
