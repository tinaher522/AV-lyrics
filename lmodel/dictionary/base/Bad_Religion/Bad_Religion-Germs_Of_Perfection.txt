<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="Germs_Of_Perfection">
Lacerate, eviscerate and perforate and mutilate
We all fall down, all fall down
Depreciate, repudiate, ameliorate, adjudicate
The wisdom found, wisdom found
Clip the wings of progress, turn the direction
Enrich the fallow soil with germs of perfection
Delegate, facilitate, investigate and obviate
The black turns green, black turns green
Separate, evaluate and cultivate and propagate
The master's dream, master's dream
Sing the fears of history with a renewed inflection
View the lost agenda with a skeptic's intention
Machine of life, oh can we make it run?
We have the tools but only just begun
Machine of life, oh can we make it run?
The calculations of a greater sum
Clip the wings of progress, turn the direction
Enrich the fallow soil with germs of perfection
