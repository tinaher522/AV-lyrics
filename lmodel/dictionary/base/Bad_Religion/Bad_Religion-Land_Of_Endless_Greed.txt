<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="Land_Of_Endless_Greed">
I don' t really care what other people may say
I gotta go on living my life anyway
Everything is golden, everything's for sale
I'm done with unsubatantiated fairy tales
But out here on the lap of luxury
Unlimited guarantee for your insatiable need
In the land of endless greed
In the emerald forest hear a nasty sound
The big rigs and the minors come and shake the ground
On the field of plenty the grathers gather 'round
To watch the game of supply and demand go down
But out here on the lap of luxury
Unlimited guarantee for your insatiable need
In the land of endless greed
I don' t really care what other people may say
I gotta go on living my life anyway
The poor don't have to struggle in dismal poverty
Anyone can be the way they want to be
But out here on the lap of luxury
Unlimited guarantee for your insatiable need
In the land of endless greed
