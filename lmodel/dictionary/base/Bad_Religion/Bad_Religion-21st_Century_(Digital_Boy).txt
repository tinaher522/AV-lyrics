Against The Grain Version
I can't believe it, the way you look sometimes
Like a trampled flag on a city street, oh yeah
And I don't want it, the things you're offering me
Symbolized bar code, quick I.D., oh yeah
'Cause I'm a 21st century digital boy
I don't know how to live, but I've got a lot of toys
My daddy's a lazy middle-class intellectual
My mommy's on Valium, so ineffectual
Ain't life a mystery, yeah?
I can't explain it
The things they're saying to me
It's going "yah yah yah yah yah yah yah"
Oh yeah
'Cause I'm a 21st century digital boy
I don't know how to read but I got a lot of toys
My daddy's a lazy middle-class intellectual
My mommy's on Valium so ineffectual
Ain't life a mystery, yeah?
Tried to tell you about No Control
But now I really don't know
And then you told me how bad you had to Suffer
Is that really all you had to offer?
See I'm a 21st century digital boy
I don't know how to read, but I've got a lot of toys
My daddy's a lazy middle-class intellectual
My mommy's on Valium, so ineffectual
Cat's foot, iron claw (21st century digital boy)
Neuro-surgeons scream for more (21st century digital boy)
Innocents raped with napalm fire (21st century digital boy)
Everything I want, I really need (21st century digital boy)
21st century schizoid boy
21st century video boy
21st century digital boy
21st century sofa boy
Stranger Than Fiction Version
