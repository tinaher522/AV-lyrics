<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="American_Dream">
I hate my family, hate my school
Speed limits, and the golden rule
Hate people who aren't what they seem
More than anything else, American dream
American dream's gonna swallow you whole
It's bursting at the seam
It'll sweep you away, so enjoy it today
Tomorrow you'll be old thus useless
American dream
American dream
American dream, that's ok
Cause no one dare give you away
I hate my job, I hate your god
I hate hypocrites and common slobs
Hate people who aren't what they seem
More than anything else, American dream
Promise me today
I'll have a Chevrolet
With whitewalls on the side
One boy, one girl, comfortable lies
American dream
American dream
American dream, that's ok
Cause no one dare give you away
American dream!
