<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="It's_Reciprocal">
Hoarding turns allure to discontent 
Altruism's a grind all it's own 
Morning makes you know your in a cell 
But love is just as pure as you both 
Because it's reciprocal, 
It's reciprocal, 
It's reciprocal, 
It's reciprocal, 
When true love is metaphysical 
Venal desires we learn to beset 
You and me we've got a special thing 
But i want you to never forget 
It's reciprocal, 
It's reciprocal, 
It's reciprocal, 
It's reciprocal
Each bedtime I 
Stir with regret 
Guilty and vain, 
Hoping for retribution 
Charity's immune from my demands 
I don't expect a thing from the weak 
But you my love are measured and compared 
Predisposed to my profane decree 
It's reciprocal, 
It's reciprocal, 
It's reciprocal, 
It's reciprocal
It's reciprocal!
