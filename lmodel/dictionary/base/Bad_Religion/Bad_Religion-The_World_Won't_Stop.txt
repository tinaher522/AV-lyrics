<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="The_World_Won't_Stop">
You've got to quit your little charade and join the freak parade
Now that your road has been paved from conception to your grave
Enormous things to do, others' practices to eschew
To be better than you is impossible to do
But the world won't stop without you
No, the world won't stop without you
Your achievements are unsurpassed, you are highly-ordered mass
But you can bet your ass that your free energy will dissipate
Two billion years thus far, now mister here you are
An element in a sea of enthalpic organic compounds
The world won't stop without you
The world won't stop without you
You're only as elegant as your actions let you be
A piece of chaos related phylogenetically
To every living organ system we're siblings don't you see?
The earth rotates and will revolve without you constantly
Two billion years thus far, now mister here you are
An element in a sea of enthalpic organic compounds
The world won't stop without you
No, the world won't stop without you
I said the world won't stop without you
