<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="Damned_To_Be_Free">
Death and the shadow that it casts on life scares me little or none
People tell me of a divine right and the happy chosen one
I'm a freak 'cause my morals clash with others in the world
I go home while they work hard, then they say I'm wrong
There's only one place to be, while living with tragedy
If their sins affected me, I gotta be damned to be free
Freedom is responsibility, pay more than it's worth
Instincts tells us not to die, hazy myth since birth
Learn their rules and play their game, deceive yourself in haste
Turn your own brain into dust, it's not theirs to waste
There's only one place to be, while living with tragedy
Extract the nectar, burn the tree, I gotta be damned to be free
Thinking this world it ain't so bad
Dying it's just another fad
Working eight hours, that's not for me
Dying it's just your destiny
