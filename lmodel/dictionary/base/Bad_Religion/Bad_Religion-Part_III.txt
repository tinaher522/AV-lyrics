<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="Part_III">
The final page is written in the books of history
As man unleashed his deadly bombs and sent troops overseas
To fight a war which can't be won and kills the human race
A show of greed and ignorance, man's quest for dominance
They say when a mistake is made, a lesson can be learned
But this time, there's no second chance, the hate engulfs the world
A million lives are lost each day, a city slowly burns
A mother holds her dying child, but no one is concerned
