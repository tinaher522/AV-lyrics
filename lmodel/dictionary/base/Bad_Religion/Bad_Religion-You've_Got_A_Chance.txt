<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="You've_Got_A_Chance">
A rhapsody, contestants in disguise
A nation of desire, but who will win the prize?
The people stand united, reluctantly aligned
Copying and lying are the favorite pastime
You've got a chance to confront the world today
Desperate romance is the curse of castaways
What good is skill if you don't make it to the dance?
Despite circumstance, you've got a chance
Common life depicted on afternoon TV
It's spiked to give the miserable a vogue identity
Hate your neighbors, cheat your friends, they don't discriminate
Popularity and fame don't care if you're a reprobate
You've got a chance to confront the world today
Desperate romance is the curse of castaways
What good is skill if you don't make it to the dance?
Despite circumstance, you've got a chance
I'm tired of all this Shakespearean misinformation
I want to win the game
You've got the right intentions, but who's got time to think?
You've got a noon appointment, you've got to hit the links
You're talking in the stratosphere, you're curled up on the floor
With such a wealth of information why are you so poor?
You've got a chance to be relevant today
Desperate romance is the curse of castaways
What good is skill if you don't make it to the dance?
Despite circumstance, you've got a chance
You've got a chance to confront the world today
You've got a chance though it seems so far away
Don't you believe what the wise men have to say
Despite circumstance, you've got a chance
You've got a chance
You've got a chance
You've got a chance
You've got a chance
