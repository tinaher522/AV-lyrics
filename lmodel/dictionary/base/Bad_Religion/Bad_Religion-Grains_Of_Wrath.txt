<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="Grains_Of_Wrath">
Back in '83, a man came to me and he told me "Son
Our way of life is done," but I was only young
With an eye to the fields, speculators and yields rotten to the core
Monoculture whores entered the bidding wars from distant shores
I don't want to be
In the land known as destitute and free
With the grains of wrath blazing a path
From sea to shining sea
Oh, the sinuous trails of concrete and rails and exhausted roars
Population wars setting our future course
Is profit and greed the only conceit on a scale betrween
Mere prosperity and inhumanity? It may well be
But I don't want to be
In the land known as destitute and free
With the grains of wrath blazing a path
From sea to shining sea
I don't want to be
In the land known as destitute and free
With the grains of wrath blazing a path
From sea to shining sea
