<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="Chasing_The_Wild_Goose">
There was a man who banged his head against a wall
He banged for 20 years, the damn thing wouldn't fall
He left an honest life, he left a broken wife
He left it all behind, just to see what he could find
Millions and millions chase the wild goose tonight
To conquer loneliness they'll chase it all their lives
And when they find it they can just lay down and die
It seems the game is mostly pointless in the presence of the prize
There was a woman who had a man as cold as ice
He built four walls so strong and he kept her locked inside
She harbored loneliness, her husband couldn't guess
That she'd take off her dress and kill herself without a mess
