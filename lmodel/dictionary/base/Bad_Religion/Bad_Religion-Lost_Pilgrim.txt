<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="Lost_Pilgrim">
Pilgrim, those are dry and bitter tears
And lonely eyes look way beyond your years
Pilgrim, did you drink the mercury?
Your lips turned blue and you're struggling just to see
You were too far gone to carry on
Now your life has stalled
As you march ahead you go no place at all
Pilgrim, when you left them all behind
The loneliness destroyed your able mind
Pilgrim, see the writing on the door?
It's taking you back to a place you were before
And the next in line paces your stride
Waiting for your fall
With a hope that lies in a hidden master's call
Pious eyes ignoring passersby
Headlong to their grave
Don't despair this world of toil and care
This pilgrim lost his way
Pilgrim, will you ever find your call?
Is truth so pure that you're willing to risk it all?
Pious eyes ignoring passersby
Headlong to their grave
Don't despair this world of toil and care
This pilgrim lost his way
