<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="Fuck_Armageddon..._This_Is_Hell">
There's people out there that say I'm no good
'Cause I don't believe the things that I should
And when the final conflict comes, I'll be so sorry I did wrong
And hope and pray that our lord God will think I'm good
Countries manufacture bombs and guns
To kill your brother for something that he hasn't even done
Smog is ruining my lungs, but they aren't sorry they've done wrong
They hide behind their lies that they're helping everyone
In the end the good will go to heaven up above
The bad will perish in the depths of hell
How can hell be any worse when life alone is such a curse?
Fuck Armageddon, this is hell
Fuck Armageddon, this is hell
Fuck Armageddon, this is hell
We're living in the denouement of the battle's gripping awe
So what's the use of being good to satisfy them all?
How could hell be any worse? Life alone is such a curse!
Fuck Armageddon, this is hell
Fuck Armageddon, this is hell
Fuck Armageddon, this is hell
Fuck Armageddon, this is hell
Fuck Armageddon, this is hell
