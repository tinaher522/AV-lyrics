<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="Bad_Religion">
See my body it's nothing to get hung about
I'm nobody except genetic runaround
Spiritual era's gone it ain't comin' back
Bad religion a cabal that is all that's left
Hey Mr. Mime 
Stop wasting my time
With your factory precision
Factory precision is your
Bad religion too good to take
Indecision it's not too late
Bad religion bad religion
And don't you know the place you live's a piece of shit
Don't you know blind faith in life will conquer it
Don't you know responsibility is ours
I don't care a thing about eternal fires
Listen this time 
It's more than a rhyme
It's your indecision 
Your indecision is your
Bad religion too good to take
Indecision it's not too late
Bad religion too good to take
Indecision it's not too late
Bad religion
Bad religion
Bad religion
