<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="Henchman">
Stranded
In a life in which your struggle for acceptance is a never-ending chore
Upbraided
For your actions past and present and rewarded for ideas of the future's bright open door
The henchman is a human analogue
Of the suffering multitudes who, like good dogs, sit and lick for their reward
So what good advice have I got for you
To insure against your likely metamorphosis into this reprobate?
Don't be a henchman
Stand on your laurels
Do what no one else does
And praise the good of other men for goodness sake
And when everyone else in the world follows your lead
Although a cold day in hell it will surely be
That's when the entire world shall live in harmony
