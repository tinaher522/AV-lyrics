<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="Faith_In_God">
It's all right to have faith in God
But when you bend to their rules and their fucking lies
That's when I start to have pity on you
You're living on a mound of dirt
But you can't explain your reason for existence
So you blame it on God
There's so much hatred in this world
And you can't decide who's pulling the strings
So you figure it's God
Your whole life foreshadows death
And you finally realize you don't want to die alone
So you'll always have God
It's all right to have faith in God
But when you bend to their rules and their fucking lies
That's when I start to have pity on you
It's all right to have faith in God
But when you bend to their rules and their fucking lies
That's when I start to have pity on you
There's people in the world today
Who say they're jewish, christian and such
They're all ignorant fools
They'll tell you you can't have your own way
Unless you pay money and dedicate your life
Or you'll be damned in hell
Don't be feeble like all of them
You have your own brain full of thoughts and choices
So use it don't let them use you
It's all right to have faith in God
But when you bend to their rules and their fucking lies
That's when I start to have pity on you
