<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="The_Quickening">
The quickening is an ephemeral thing
That only happens in the dark, like catching lightning in a jar
And the pain that it brings is just the promise of spring
It's madness on the wing, oh, what does it mean?
To come alive, to come alive
To come alive
To come alive, to come alive
To come alive
The entering is soulful conjecturing
Oh, lost and by the wind-grieved cost, please come back to me again
Because the way that she bleeds, he'll sit alone when he reads
Confusing words and deeds, so what does it mean?
To come alive, to come alive
To come alive
To come alive, to come alive
To come alive
To pierce the fame
Of the sacred and profane
For science, in service of the faith
But who will bear the mark of Cain?
To come alive, to come alive
To come alive
To come alive, to come alive
To come alive
