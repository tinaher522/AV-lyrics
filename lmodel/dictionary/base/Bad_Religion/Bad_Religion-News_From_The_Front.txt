<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="News_From_The_Front">
Blood is a river flowing darkly amidst the tangled roots of the tall shining city
Crazy flowing mantide migrations engorge the big ventricle of heartbroken America
So many heaven hoping hopeful groping breathers all tap together quietly and desperately in unison
Hey, hey, hey, is anybody listening?
News from the front, news from the front
We're living in troubled times
So many fighting for their lives
Why do the troops despise the news from the front?
Ignorance is the root of fear and fear is the kindling of anger
War is the bringer of shame but never has the burden lain so heavily upon the victim
Rage and desolation, pain and loneliness, isn't it all alarmingly familiar?
Hey, hey, hey, silence is a killer
News from the front, news from the front
Yeah, these are troubled times
How many more will have to die
Before the governors can't deny the news from the front?
Break down the barriers
Ally the carriers
What is your motivation?
Take a good look in the mirror
News from the front, news from the front
So many fighting for their lives
How many more will have to die?
Why does the government decry the news from the front?
