<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="Modern_Man">
I've got nothing to say
I've got nothing to do
All of my neurons are functioning smoothly
Yet still I'm a cyborg just like you
I'm one big myoma that thinks
My planet supports only me
I've got this one big problem, will I live forever?
I've got just a short time to see
Modern man, evolutionary betrayer
Modern man, ecosystem destroyer
Modern man, destroy yourself in shame
Modern man, pathetic example of Earth's organic heritage
When I look back and think
When I ponder and ask why
I see my ancestors spend with careless abandon
Assuming eternal supply
Modern man, evolutionary betrayer
Modern man, ecosystem destroyer
Modern man, destroy yourself in shame
Modern man, pathetic example of Earth's organic heritage
Just a sample of carbon-based wastage
Just a fucking tragic epic of you and I
