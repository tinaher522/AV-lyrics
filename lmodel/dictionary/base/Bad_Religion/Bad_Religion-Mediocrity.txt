<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="Mediocrity">
I've spent my life observing 
and then pondering this place 
and never has confusion ever ceased 
I've also heard a lot of exaltation for our kind 
and sanctimonious reverence for peace 
The stories from our childhood 
condition us to think 
that beauty is a basic human trait 
but how are they reconciled with daily realities 
like poverty and dominance and rape 
But you have to be 
stone cold dead not to see 
overwhelming incongruity 
as we search for suggestions to remedy... 
...Mediocrity 
If you just sit back and record what you see 
the tragic and exquisite are the same to some degree 
but most events depict a common theme: 
there's far more disorder 
than there is harmony 
I said you've got to be 
stone cold dead not to see 
overwhelming incongruity 
It is pointless to search for teleology 
Mediocrity 
(always mediocrity)
