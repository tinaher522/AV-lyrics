<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="Submission_Complete">
Dedication's the price you pay
The initiated are coddled and caged
Before you walk, as soon as you crawl
Hope is pointless when you're stuck in the trawl
Fuck the freshman lectures and brandishments
They just betray impoverished accomplishments
The puppet masters fear originality
They tighten up the tethers and they shackle your feet
Submission complete
Young recruits never have a chance
Enticed to the drill, admonished to dance
Early to rise and early to shine
Life is long but the end is nigh
Break the guilty trammels from yesteryear
Remember how rejuvenation conquers all fears
Lowly opportunists take commanding roles
And hawk ultimatums so their weakness won't show
The sad reflection
Of dead ambition
You live for nothing
Submission complete
Yeah, break the guilty trammels from yesteryear
Remember how the pain of failure makes it all clear
The lowly opportunists take commanding roles
And hawk ultimatums so their weakness won't show
The sad reflection
Of dead ambition
You live for nothing
Expectation
Indoctrination
Life's damnation
Submission complete
Dying on your feet
Submission complete
A total defeat
