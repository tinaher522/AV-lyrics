<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="In_Their_Hearts_Is_Right">
There's domething pathetic in the world today
And I don't know how it all began
As if all the shame and ounishment will finally make me understand
A word means nothing wanting action
Intentions are valuable as deeds
And a wound can dog you for a lifetime
Unless it only makes you bleed
Everybody knoes what's in their heart is right
I'm just a termite on an ant hill
I think about it every single day
A senseless being lacking inspiration
Just waiting to be blown away
Everybody knoes what's in their heart is right
