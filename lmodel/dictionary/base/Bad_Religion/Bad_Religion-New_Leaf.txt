<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="New_Leaf">
When everybody dies around you, from someone else's gun
It really makes you stop and think about the years to come
Something good had to happen to the human race
We all had better stop hoping and set our heads on straight
You've gotta turn over a new leaf
'Cause that old one's turning on you
We've gotta turn over a new leaf
If the future's only hoped for, we are doomed
Today is over, it's already shot, so we can think about ourselves
They keep on working on our nature, they're saying that can only help
Start throwing out your pockets, keep what you really only need
Save life and earth and water, there can't be any other need
You've gotta turn over a new leaf
'Cause that old one's turning on you
You've gotta turn over a new leaf
If the future's only hoped for, we are doomed
You've gotta turn over a new leaf
'Cause that old one's turning on you
You've gotta turn over a new leaf
And let your love come on through
You've gotta turn over a new leaf
'Cause that old one's turning on you
You've gotta turn over a new leaf
A new, a new, a new
