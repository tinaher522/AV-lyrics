<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="Scrutiny">
One - two - three - four - five - six - seven - eight
Days go marching by
There and back I never wait for a confident reply
Truth is stark and leaves its mark as limited constraints
And the most difficult part is accepting what the future may bring
It seems like a lifetime of scrutiny
Wither the path, whether worth the fee
A lifetime of scrutiny
And it seems as though I can't be sure of anything anymore
One - two - three - four - five - six - seven - eight
Years go flying by
No one seems to hesitate or cast an earnest eye
Judgement comes in many forms but never scarce or shy
And the litany is long as the confidence is strong in their delight
It seems like a lifetime of scrutiny
Prejudicial waters wash over me
A lifetime of scrutiny
And the words just don't equate with sense or sanity anymore
One - two - three - four - five - six - seven - eight
The faces and the names
Shattered hopes and stolen dreams and no one left to blame
Is it possible to win this pointless mortal game?
'Cuz when death comes it's swift and my friends, we end up all the same
It feels like a lifetime of scrutiny
Wither the path and whether worth the fee
A lifetime of scrutiny
And it seems as though I can't remember anything anymore
