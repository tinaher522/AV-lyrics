<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="Strange_Denial">
A mutinous enemy carved a nascent country
Sweat, blood, and valor forms the grit of our history
Bequeathed to everyone, chance and free expression
Substance was restrained and the spirit was broken
I feel a strange denial
Rhythmic as a change, constant as time
Lonely insistent whispers
Somber as a wave bye bye, bye bye
Searching for solution without constitution
Black coats by our sides promising salvation
Advocating dogmas, tickets to hereafter
Mortals in their prime with their desperate hands in the air
Daunting, complex and burning
Rhythmic as change, constant as time
Conflicts craving approval
Weighted as a murder trial, oh I feel a strange denial
Correct is consensus, everything else nonsense
Forward is the hope, forget recompense
Peace and tranquility is only for the wealthy
Dearth for the masses and inequality
I feel a strange denial
Rhythmic as change, constant as time
Lonely insistent whispers
Dissipating in the night like a lone forgotten light
And no one is helping me
It's a strange denial
