<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="Don't_Sell_Me_Short">
We don't need anymore mountains
Because the trail builders failed to give us passage there
So we can't reach the sky
We don't need anymore failure
There is human tragedy that's written everywhere
We are all too young to die
Like a mystery that's here to stay
Some people never go away
'Cause they've got something to say
Don't sell me short, you've been wrong too long
Don't brush me off just because I don't belong
Like it or not, I'm all you've got, dispose me when I'm shot
Just don't sell me short, I might not be who you thought
We don't need anymore fables
Because the writers have passed and left us lesson-less
We must find our own way
We don't need anymore privilege
There is vivid desperation that is powerless
That no surplus can repay
Like the fix of rapture in a trance
Oh fates are sealed by circumstance
So you've got to take a chance
Like the fix of rapture in a trance
Oh, fates are sealed by circumstance
So you've got to take a chance
Don't sell me short, you've been wrong too long
Don't brush me off just because I don't belong
Pass me on by, ignore my cry, forget me when I die
Just don't sell me short, not while I'm still alive
Everybody's talking about heaven on earth
I'm still trying to figure out just what I'm worth
I'm full of emotion and stuff you can't contain
You just want to flush me down the drain
But you can't make me go away!
Don't sell me short, you've been wrong too long
Don't brush me off just because I don't belong
Like it or not, I'm all you've got, dispose me when I'm shot
Just don't sell me short, I might not be who you thought
You've been wrong too long
Don't brush me off just because I don't belong
Pass me on by and forget me when I die
Don't sell me short, not while I'm still alive
