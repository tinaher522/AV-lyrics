<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="All_There_Is">
This song goes out to all the hopeless sinners
With grave allegiances so meaningless and vain
The walking wounded in a pageant of contenders
Who balance on a rail of pain for just a pail of rain
And everything is barely missed, blood relations and bricks
My expression, my confession, add it up, extract a lesson
More than this, once again, like a bullet, as a friend
Tell me, can that be all there is?
In my rectory of doubt, I kneel to pray like one devout
As time the great, gray dreamless sleep of a useless modern god
Erodes away each storied day as wretched Adams with hell to pay
Content upon a rail of pain for just a little rain
And everything is dearly missed, blood relations and bricks
My expression, my confession, add it up, extract a lesson
More than this, once again, like a bullet, as a friend
Tell me, can that be all there is?
There's an endless disposition and it doesn't mean a goddamn thing
There's space for a paper airplane race in the eye of a hurricane
And if pigs could fly, then surely so could I, but this pedestrian knows better than to even try
And my divinity is caught between the colors of a butterfly
And everything is dearly missed, blood relations and bricks
My expression, my confession, add it up, extract a lesson
More than this, once again, like a bullet, as a friend
Tell me, can that be all there is?
