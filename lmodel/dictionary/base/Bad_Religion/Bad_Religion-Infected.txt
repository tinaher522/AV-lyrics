<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="Infected">
Now here I go, hope I don't break down
I won't take anything, I don't need anything
Don't want to exist, I can't persist
Please stop before I do it again
Just talk about nothing
Let's talk about nothing
Let's talk about no one
Please talk about no one, someone, anyone
You and me have a disease
You affect me, you infect me
I'm afflicted, you're addicted
You and me, you and me
I'm on the edge, get against the wall
I'm so distracted, I'd like to strike you
Here's my confession, you learned your lesson
Stop me before I do it again
Just talk about nothing
Let's talk about nothing
Let's talk about no one
Please talk about no one, someone, anyone
You and me have a disease
You affect me, you infect me
I'm afflicted, you're addicted
You and me, you and me
You're clear as a heavy lead curtain
Want to drill you like an ocean
We can work it out, I've been running out
Now I'm running out, don't be mad about it, baby
You and me have a disease
You affect me, you infect me
I'm afflicted, you're addicted
You and me, you and me
I want to tie you, crucify you
Kneel before you, revile your body
You and me, we're made in heaven
I want to take you, I want to break you
Supplicate you with thorny roses
You and me are incurable
I want to bathe you in holy water
I want to kill you upon the altar
You and me, you and me
