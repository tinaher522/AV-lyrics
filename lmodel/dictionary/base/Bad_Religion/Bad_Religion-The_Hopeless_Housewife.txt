<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="The_Hopeless_Housewife">
Oh me, oh my
Oh me, oh my
Oh me, oh my
Oh me, oh my
Get out of your 1950s fantasy
Your face shines with misery transparently
Spew out that sobering half-assed victim rhetoric
Make 'em all squirm while they chew on it
It's a secret handshake and a passing wink of the eye
As the witches bridge club weekly meet to pin the tail on the sly
But they never ask why oh why
Don't we raise our voice to the sky?
Instead we're mute and fawn, just waiting to die
Like some kind of hopeless housewife
But you can change while you're alive
And let 'em all know at least you tried
To kill the demons inside
Oh me, oh my
Oh me, oh my
Oh me, oh my
Oh me, oh my
Damn your transcendental paralysis
We can work together and make sense of this
Don't be so sure you can chuck it all away
You've got to proceed no matter how bad you want to stay
It's a natural cause and a comfort zone there in your head
And the world turns away as you tap the snooze button in bed
But nobody can hear a word you said
Your history was never read
Instead we're mute and fawn, just waiting to die
Like some kind of hopeless housewife
But you can change while you're alive
And let 'em all know at least you tried
To kill the demons inside
Oh me, oh my
Oh me, oh my
Oh me, oh my
Oh me, oh my
