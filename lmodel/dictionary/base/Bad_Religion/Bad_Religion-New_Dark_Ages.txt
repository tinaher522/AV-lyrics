<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="New_Dark_Ages">
Can you hear the call in our rambling land, susurrations that can expand
Beyond all hope of light and plunge us into unrelenting night?
A pall on truth and reason, it feels like hunting season
So avoid those lines of sight and we'll set this right
Welcome to the new dark ages
Yeah, I hope you're living right
These are the new dark ages
And the world might end tonight
Now come ye children, one and all, let's heed Ezekiel's call
And bide until the word is good and right then get plucked clean out of sight
The world will be erased, our kin will be immaculate ejaculate in space
Before the king of king's love, he'll snatch us from above, brothers, help me sing it
Welcome to the new dark ages
Yeah, I hope you're living right
These are the new dark ages
And the world might end tonight
So how do you sleep?
There's nothing to keep, this is deep
Because we're animals with golden rules
Who can't be moved by rational views
Yeah, welcome to the new dark ages
I hope you're living right
Welcome to the new dark ages
Say it again, yeah
These are the new dark ages
I hope you're living right
Welcome to the new dark ages
And the world might end tonight
