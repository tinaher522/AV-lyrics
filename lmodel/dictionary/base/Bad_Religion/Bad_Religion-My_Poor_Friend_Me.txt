<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="My_Poor_Friend_Me">
I know a man who doesn't have many friends
I know a place he lives where trouble never ends
I know it's hard for him to read between the lines
And his days are getting so much shorter
He simply turns away and dons a bitter frown
His world is crumbling, his ship is waited down
He doesn't care as long as he can wear the crown
I know this man all too well
It's my poor friend me
A portrayal of the great dichotomy
It's my poor friend me
And I'm running out of steam
I know there are people who are cynical and vain
They point their finger 'cause they can't accept the blame
They live their lives under a blanket of shame
And their progeny crawl from underneath it
Lately I've come to see the solution
And it begins with me
But I'm so fallibly human
I'll pick the lock but will not turn the key
All people running scared, we live, breathe, and die
All too aware that time is slipping on by
We have solutions but don't even try
And I feel I know just who to blame
It's my poor friend me
A reminder of a tragic history
It's my poor friend me
And I'm running out of steam
