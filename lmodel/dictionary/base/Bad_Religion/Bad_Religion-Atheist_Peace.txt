<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="Atheist_Peace">
Maybe it's too late for an intellectual debate
But a residue of confusion remains
Changing with the times and developmentally tortured minds
Are the average citizen's sources of pain
(Yeah) Tell me what we're fighting for
I don't remember anymore, only temporary reprieve
And the world might cease if we fail to tame the beast
From the faith that you release comes an atheist peace
Atheist peace
Political forces rent bitter cold winds of discontent
And the modern age emerged triumphantly
But now it seems we've stalled and it's time to de-evolve
And relive the dark chapters of history
(Yeah) Tell me what we're fighting for
No progress ever came from war, only a false sense of increase
And the world won't wait for the truth upon a plate
But we're ready now to feast on an atheist peace
Atheist peace
