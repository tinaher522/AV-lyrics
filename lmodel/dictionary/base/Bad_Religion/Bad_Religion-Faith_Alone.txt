<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="Faith_Alone">
Heard a sermon from a creaky pulpit with no one in the nave
I paid a visit to the synagogue and I left there feeling blame
No one can tell me what to do
They have not the capacity to answer me
What the world needs now is some answers to our problems
We can't buy more time 'cause our tender isn't valid
If your soul needs love you can get consoled by pity
But it looks as though faith alone won't sustain us no more
Watched the scientists throw up their hands conceding progress will resolve it all
Saw the manufacturers of earth's debris ignore another Greenpeace call
No one could tell me what to do
No one had the ability to answer me
What the world needs now is some accountability
We can't buy more time 'cause time won't accept our money
If your soul needs love you can always have my pity
But it looks as though faith alone won't sustain us no more
What the world needs now is some answers to our problems
We can't buy more time 'cause our tender isn't valid
What the world needs now is some accountability
If your soul needs love you can get consoled by pity
But faith alone won't sustain us anymore
Faith alone won't sustain us anymore
