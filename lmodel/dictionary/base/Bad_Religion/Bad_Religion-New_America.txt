<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="New_America">
Do you know the cost of future misery?
Have you lost your sense of sustainability?
We are just a step away from realizing what we strive to be
But we've got to break out from this insulated blind and lame senility
Wake up the new America
Transcend the mass hysteria
Change is the thing you're wary of
We need a new America
Laurels, human triumph, bestowments from the past
Victories don't mean a thing if they don't last
We are just marching toward extinction with blinders on our eyes
Jeopardizing everything we've learned and come to realize, you call that wise?
Open your eyes, America
See through the lies they tell to us
Confront the fears that worry us
We need a new America
Now we don't have to be afraid to reinvent
We've got to start to build, progress and implement
For when we take our fill and never pay the price
We only build ourselves a fleeting, false paradise
Yeah, you can live in staunch denial
And mark me as your enemy
But I'm just a voice among the throng
Who want a brighter destiny, they say with me
We are the new America
This is the new America
We are the new America
This is the new America
