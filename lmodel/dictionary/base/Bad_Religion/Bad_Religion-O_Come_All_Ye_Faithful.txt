O Come All Ye Faithful
Joyful and triumphant
O come ye, O come ye to Bethlehem
Come and behold Him
Born the King of Angels
O come, let us adore Him
O come, let us adore Him
O come, let us adore Him
Christ the Lord
O Sing, choirs of angels
Sing in exultation
Sing all that hear in heaven God's holy word
Give to our Father glory in the Highest
O come, let us adore Him
O come, let us adore Him
O come, let us adore Him
Christ the Lord
Hail! Lord, we greet Thee
Born this happy morning
O Jesus! For evermore be Thy name adored
Word of the Father, now in flesh appearing
O come, let us adore Him
O come, let us adore Him
O come, let us adore Him
Christ the Lord
O come, let us adore Him
Christ the Lord
