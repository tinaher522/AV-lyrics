<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="The_Surface_Of_Me">
A study of history reveals an unflagging appeal to mystery
You talk about abstraction
At the top of the list, but you might as well get pissed
'Cause in me the essence does not exist
You're so shallow, how can your romance hope to be the veil of
An ersatz human nature
That can pacify but never slept well
When there's the pretension of living a lie?
Take me as I am, judge me for my crimes
I can say I'll behave freely all the time
You can predict what I'll say, it's in my DNA
But soon I'll be a catalog number anyway
So say a little prayer
Convince yourself that someone cares
All I am is what you see, there is nothing more than the surface of me
There is nothing more than the surface of me
Apologies to Skinner, but I do believe that I feel like I'm a winner
Having just discovered a long solved modal secret
Of how I always feel
So goddamn downtrodden and desperate
Take me as I am, judge me for my crimes
I can say I'll behave freely all the time
You can predict what I'll say, it's in my DNA
But soon I'll be a catalog number anyway
So say a little prayer
Convince yourself that someone cares
All I am is what you see, there is nothing more than the surface of me
There is nothing more than the surface of me
Take me as I am, judge me for my crimes
I can say I'll behave freely all the time
You can predict what I'll say, it's in my DNA
But soon I'll be a catalog number anyway
So say a little prayer
Convince yourself that someone cares
All I am is what you see, there is nothing more than the surface of me
There is nothing more than the surface of me
What you see is the surface of me
