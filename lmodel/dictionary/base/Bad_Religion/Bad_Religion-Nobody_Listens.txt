<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="Nobody_Listens">
Hey mister, don't point at me
You shout rhetoric nonsense like a Pavlovian model responding to questions
Hey teacher, arrogance is bliss
You spend your time turning water into life as if you were God's foreman
Is it any wonder things seem so awry?
We swim in a sea of confusion
And don't have to think to survive
So nobody listens
Hey recluse, don't shout at me
You proclaim yourself expert by extensions of the methods detailed in your magazines
Hey downer, don't prey on me
We've all got bum raps that torment us day to day, that we hoist on our own shoulders
Is it any wonder people pass you by?
Your plea for understanding
Is heard as desperate lies
So nobody listens
I can't help you
I can't help you
I can't help you
I can't help you now
Is it any wonder things are so inane?
So many quests for compassion
Are just for someone's personal gain
So nobody listens
Nobody listens to you
