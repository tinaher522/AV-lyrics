<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="The_Gray_Race">
The framework of the world is black and white
The infrastructure builders flex their might
Turning true emotion into digital expression
One by one we all fall down
The gray race shrivels, trapped inside
The world it creates is black and white
The gray race shrivels, trapped inside
The world it creates is black and white
The perpetual destructive motion machine
Began to chart a course never before seen
Turning raw compassion into fields of plus and minus
One by one we all give in
The gray race shrivels, trapped inside
The world it creates is black and white
The gray race shrivels, trapped inside
The world it creates is black and white
I'd swear there were times when I was someone else
A person with determination and knowledge of the self
But you've flattened me to rubble and now I can see
That I'm just a faded negative of the image I used to be
Just a shadow
And that's our dilemma
