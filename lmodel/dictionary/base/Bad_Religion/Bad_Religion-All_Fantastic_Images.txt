<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="All_Fantastic_Images">
England
Seemed like a beautiful place from afar
Until one day
I saw how miserable things really are
All fantastic images
They only are apparent
Propagated just by hope
And desire to share it
Beauty
Was the allure that brought me close to you
Loneliness
Was the bond that made me stick like glue
All fantastic images
They only are apparent
Promoted by desperate hope
That things are somewhere better
I don't have a thing against fantasy
But to chase it down just don't make sense to me
If your only hope is simply peace and love
You end up discarding most of what you're made of
All fantastic images
They only are apparent
Promoted by desperate hope
That things are somewhere better
All fantastic images
