<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="Slaves_(Second_Version)">
Don't try to say that I threaten your freedom
We've done without for 20 years, so think if we really need 'em
We're all just slaves for the troop commanders (x3)
We're all slaves
We can blow up things better than in any country except this one.
Waiting for it too then you realize it ain't too much fun.
We're in a country, Democracy, supposed to be the best on the globe.

LivingÂ ? for the high class clones
And
We're all just slaves for the troop commanders (x3)
We're all slaves
And
We're all just slaves for the troop commanders
We're all slaves
