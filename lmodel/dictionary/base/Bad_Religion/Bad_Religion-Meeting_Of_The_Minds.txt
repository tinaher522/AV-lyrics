<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="Meeting_Of_The_Minds">
In 325, the Council devised a set of sacred testaments, transparent and wise
The truth is only ever relied on that which we agree and abide
At the meeting of the minds
Reading of the times
Open the blinds
To our complicated lives
We all need some kind of creed to lead us to light
In old Tennessee, the last century
All scopes were fixed on legal tricks and whether or not we should teach kids natural philosophy, despite uncomfortable verity
At the meeting of the minds
Reading of the times
Open the blinds
To our complicated lives
We all need some kind of creed to lead us to light.
Thereâ€™s a beacon that shines in the night, a dark pitch though it may be
And the halcyon fields of opportunity turn out to be consensual and arbitrary
Today on my ride I witnessed a guy complaining about how a so-and-so had lied
No longer will the market decide what the government should provide
At the meeting of the minds
Reading of the times
Open the blinds
To our complicated lives
We all need some kind of creed to lead us to light
