<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="Cease">
Blacktop pavement cover me
Like a chemical reaction or a steamroller spreading randomly
There's a distant buzz and low frequency, it tickles my ear, rumbles under my feet
And it shakes the leaves off of every tree violently
What pretension, everlasting peace
Everything must cease
Institution on the hill
Like a beacon in the mind of an ancestor to ignite a peoples' will
There's a shadowed state on the west facade, it has spread like decay to enshroud the fraud
And the descendants find it oh so odd, oh so odd
What pretension, everlasting peace
Everything must cease
Grave memorial, hewn white stone
Like the comforting caress of a mother or a friend you've always known
It evokes such pain and significance, what was once is reduced to remembrance
And the generations pass without recompense
What pretension, everlasting peace
Everything must cease
