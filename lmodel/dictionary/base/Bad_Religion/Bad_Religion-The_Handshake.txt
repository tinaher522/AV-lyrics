<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="The_Handshake">
Every time you shake someone's hand and it feels like your best friend
Could it be that it's only superficiality?
Without regard to well-being, without an inkling of compromise
Handshakes are nothing but a subtle fuck you
Contracts determine the best friendships
This is the way of the modern world
Everyone's vying for patronage
This is the way of the modern world
And something has gotta give
Every time you shake someone's hand and you share neither color nor creed
You gotta overcome the obstacles of history
There is restrained passion, mistrust and bigotry
And these have created the new foundations of society
There's no harmony just class and race
This is the way of the modern world
Everyone's fighting for dominance
This is the way of the modern world
And something has gotta give
Now I believe in unity
And I am willing to compromise
But I'm not gonna lie or sell my soul
Every time you shake someone's hand
It determines where you stand
And if you won't uphold your side then it's better to
Fend for yourself
Fend for yourself
Fend for yourself
And shun the handshake
Fend for yourself
Fend for yourself
Fend for yourself
And shun the handshake
Fend for yourself
Fend for yourself
Fend for yourself
And shun the handshake
Fend for yourself
Fend for yourself
Fend for yourself
And shun the handshake
Fend for yourself
Fend for yourself
Fend for yourself
And shun the handshake
Fend for yourself
Fend for yourself
Fend for yourself
And shun the handshake
Someone's gotta give
