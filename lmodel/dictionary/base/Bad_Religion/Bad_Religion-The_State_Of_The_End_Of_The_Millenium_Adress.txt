Neighbours, nobody loves you like we do. 
Neighbors, your government has triumphed in finally making you a public fit 
for the 21st century. 
Never before has a governing body shown so much concern for the economic 
well-being of its subjects. 
Today we have insulated you from countless factions who threathens your 
financial viability; such as the poor; the idealistic foreigners still 
clinging to their childish notions of social welfare; why, you're even kept 
uninformed of useless propagandist journalism that reports alleged 
violations of human rights (We all know they wouldn't have been punished if 
they hadn't been doing something wrong!!). And who better to dispense such 
blantently evident factoids but a self-appointed authority like myself? 
Acid Rain is a thing of the past... Too many possible causes, too little 
signifigance for our modern thinking public, besides industrial 
manufacturing is at an all time low anyway, who needs those narrow minded 
laborers anyway. Too many mouths to feed, and to many burden on the pay 
roll! Who needs 'em? Here in the land of the free-time. Someother ass 
back-ward country will give us what we need by exploiting its uneducated 
children. 
The Internet has expanded our ability to pacify average americans better 
than ever by offering fantastical adventures to every corner of the 
imagination. Your home office is the window to your world, and the heart of 
your social life. Such reclusive behaviour helps clear the roads and public 
works from overburden like the lower middle-class and others who depend 
shamelessly on their government. Today you are freer than ever to do what 
you want, provided you can pay for it! 
Remeber, the first word in USA is US 
We have arrived neighbours, we are the priviliged elite!
