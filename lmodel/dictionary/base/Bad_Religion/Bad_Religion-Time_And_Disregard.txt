<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="Time_And_Disregard">
Part one
From the bird and the deer who live on the same
To the condominiums that litter the plain
It took time... time and disregard
From the green and the trees that shot high in the air
To the high-business market-men who take all that's there
It took time... time and disregard
Part two
One more acre, another tree
It's all untamed, of course it's free
One more acre, it seems no one cares
Another great chance to put a building there
Part three
I used to roam, wherever I would
I'd see my friends and I'd eat what I could
We did live together in our borderless state
Survival our instinct, nature our fate
Today I see borders and my friends disappear
Man chooses my fate thus I live in fear
Tomorrow the trucks come
I've nowhere to run
My home is destroyed so they can have fun.
Part four
From the wild natural wonderland from which we all came
To the cement and metal that lost all the game
It took time... time and disregard............
