<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="Only_Rain">
Hey scientist please save us from our rainy days
Because your counterpart in the magic art is manufacturing judgment day
There's a fell wind blowing out of the east
Bringing famine drought and plague
Well now at least that's what they say
Rain fell like judgment
Across my windowpane
Said it fell like judgment
But it was only rain
Well I know what's wrong and I know what's right
And I know that evil exists sure as day turns into night
When a man gets down on his knees to pray you know he'll find what he is able
But chances are he'll find it either way
Rain fell like judgment
Across my windowpane
Said it fell like judgment
But it was only rain
It fell like judgment
Across my windowpane
Said it fell like judgment
But it was only rain
Oh Lord have mercy on a humble man
Lost in the wilderness without a guiding hand
Rain fell like judgment
Across my windowpane
Said it fell like judgment
But it was only rain
It fell like judgment
Across my windowpane
Said it fell like judgment
But it was only rain
