<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="No_Substance">
History doesn't make something right
Consensus is not a fact based exercise
You're tied and bound to this self-indulgent enterprise
We call America
A brush with a star, a token of love
A name in the sand, enough is enough
A diet of air, a face on the net
A fish in your palm, your television set
Once you convince yourself
The universe falls into place
You've got your ideas and your posse of friends
You all make rules and the fun never ends
But still there's a problem that leaves you gasping for air
You look for some meaning, blank smiles are all that's there
And still water stales a soft summer breeze
You cling to your hopes while you drop to your knees
There's no substance
There's no substance
Once you convince yourself
The universe falls into place
You've got your ideas and your posse of friends
You all make rules and the fun never ends
But still there's a problem that leaves you gasping for air
You look for some meaning, blank smiles are all that's there
And still water stales a soft summer breeze
You cling to your hopes while you drop to your knees
There's no substance
There's no substance
