<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="Best_For_You">
Above us lay the burdens
Below us lay the truth
We're somewhere in the middle
And we're all discontent too
Is someone watching over you?
Inside they know what's best for you
Judgment's not tomorrow
It's today, yes now it's here
But no, it isn't Jesus
Take a look at all your peers
They're all looking down on you
Inside they know what's best for you
Everybody knows what's best for you
Everybody knows what's best for you
Everybody knows what's best for you
Everybody knows what's best for you
Everybody knows what's best for you
Everybody knows what's best for you
Everybody knows what's best for you
Everybody knows what's best for you
