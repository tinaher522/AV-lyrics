<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="Watch_It_Die">
I was born on planet Earth
The rotating ball where man comes first
It's been around for a long, long time
But now it's time to watch it die
I saw a man on the big blue screen
He ruled the world economy
He said the rich would never concede
But someday soon he'll be put to sleep
I've seen the life of the forest green
And adaptations of the deep blue sea
And who know who is the fittest?
They will all soon be put to rest
On a plunging flight
And we're sitting in the pilot's seat
In the midst of life
People on a dark horizon, praying somebody will save their lives
I was born on the planet Earth
At a drastic time full of plastic mirth
And every day I've seen increasing signs
And you would too if you'd open your eyes
You had a chance, you did not try
So now it's time to watch it die
