<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="Television">
Television, television, television, television
Television, television, television, television
Oh yeah, I want to bask in your golden light
Submerge in electric waves
I need my connection
To the world outside
The world outside is buzzing like an angry wasp in summer
The candidates are running and the son of God is coming
Crackle mental convolutions tune in to the revolution
Whereby everyone's included so we'll never have to be alone
Television, television, television, television
Television, television, television, television
Oh yeah, I want to bathe in your golden light
Submerge in electric waves
I need my injection
From the world outside
Every atom of my body, blood, and sinew, bone and fiber
I can't distill you from my blood, you're a hungry germ inside of me
You're my lover, my heroine, my conscience, and my voice and
I know now that I have learned to let you in, I will never have to be alone
Television, television, television, television
Television, television, television, television
Oh yeah, I want to bathe in your golden light
Submerge in electric waves
I'd take after my mother but she's from a different generation
I prefer my big brother, he's so gentle and understanding
And I learn what I can by the television light
So that when I'm all alone I know it's gonna be alright
Television, television, television, television
Television, television, television, television
