<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="White_Trash_(2nd_Generation)">
Wasted children, fixed blank eyes
Blood and sweat, we socialize
Broken homes from which they come
Beer-stained dad, compliant mom
Fear and love, much despised
Replaced by comfortable lies
Teenage classic, more cliche
One step further on the edge of decay
White trash, 2nd generation
White trash, 2nd generation
White trash, 2nd generation
Don your crown and cleanse the nation
Are you ready to fight for your morality?
Right wing allies, white supremacy
Pretty fascist on the tube
Draped in red and white and blue
White trash, 2nd generation
Stupid foibles, indignation
Offspring of suburban fright
Pearl-white creatures of the night
White trash, 2nd generation
White trash, 2nd generation
White trash, 2nd generation
Don your crown and cleanse the nation
Stiff blue collar, coat and tie
Brand new breeds side by side
Christian ethic, right extremes
Shoved down our throat as the american dream
White trash, 2nd generation
Stupid foibles, indignation
Offspring of suburban fright
Pearl-white creatures of the night
White trash, 2nd generation
White trash, 2nd generation
White trash, 2nd generation
Don your crown and cleanse the nation
White trash, 2nd generation
White trash, 2nd generation
White trash, 2nd generation
Don your crown and cleanse the nation
