<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="Heroes_&_Martyrs">
Amid the heat and the wrack, hot boots invested and cracked
Poor candidates jacked into gray light
An ultra-violent call summoning both poet and thrall
Sweet catalyst for the acolytes
Our heroes and martyrs present two points of view
Tell me which deity you're praying to
Into a welter of night, flack rounds and roiling blight
Cracked vertebrates stacked by the wayside
An ultra-violent call summoning both poet and thrall
The inveterate blind seeking daylight
Into a welter of night
Flack, rounds and roiling blight
Cracked vertebrates stacked by the wayside
An ultra-violent call summoning both poet and thrall
The inveterate blind seeking daylight
Our heroes and martyrs present two points of view
Tell me which deity you're praying to
