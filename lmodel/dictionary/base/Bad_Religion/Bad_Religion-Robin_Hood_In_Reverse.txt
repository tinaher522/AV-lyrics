<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="Robin_Hood_In_Reverse">
Here is the church
There is the steeple
Open up the door
Corporations are people
Wait what did he say?
What the fuck did he say?
It couldn't last
They had to crash
Some partys are just made that way
But when the bell rings
The boys will sing
Swing low street precariat
Let's say we try to get this right
Said the plutocrat to Jesus Christ
And when the old fox fearing the worst
Made his entrance in a hearse
Then the nine in black robes all went berserk
This is a tale of Robin Hood in reverse
Citizens united
I was excited
When the kids are united they will never be divided
But that was yesterday
There's a brand new sham to today
Let's say we try to get this right
Said the plutocrat to Jesus Christ
And when the old fox fearing the worst
Made his entrance in a hearse
Then the nine in black robes all went berserk
This is a tale of Robin Hood in reverse
