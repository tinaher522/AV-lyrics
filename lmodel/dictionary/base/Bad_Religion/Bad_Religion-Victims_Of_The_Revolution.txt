<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="Victims_Of_The_Revolution">
What will prove to be our big mistake
Short-sighted arrogance, all for what sake?
Our families to ashes, our ambition to dust
Our progeny in silence, thinking what about us?
But don't forget the dance of neglect
The march for empowering prosperity
The pain from loss and want for mere lucidity
Just maternal residue, and I was there too and maybe so were you
When something is won it comes with sacrifice
It's there beneath the joy, the glory, and pride
And rarely it's acknowledged but in positive light
Consciously omitting the loser's plight
But don't forget the dance of neglect
The craving for community that never was met
The longing for status and the overture of regret
With no one to deter, pathetically unsure, forgetting who they were
Just maternal residue
And I was there too
And maybe so were you
