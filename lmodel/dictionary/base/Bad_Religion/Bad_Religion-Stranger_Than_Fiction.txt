<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="Stranger_Than_Fiction">
A febrile shocking violent smack
And the children are hoping for a heart attack
Tonight the windows are watching
The streets all conspire and the lamppost can't stop crying
If I could fly high above the world
Would I see a bunch of living dots spell the word stupidity?
Or would I see hungry lover homicides, loving brother suicides
And olly olly oxenfrees who pick a side and hide?
The world is scratching at my door
My morning paper's got the scores
The human interest stories
And the obituary
Cockroach naps and rattling traps
How many devils can you fit upon a match head?
Caringosity killed the Kerouac cat
Sometimes truth is stranger than fiction
In my alley around the corner there's a wino with feathered shoulders
And a spirit giving head for crack and he'll never want it back
There's a little kid and his family eating crackers like thanksgiving
And a pack of wild desperados scornful of living
The world is scratching at my door
My morning paper has the scores
The human interest stories
And the obituary
Cradle for a cat, Wolfe looks back
How many angels can you fit upon a match?
I want to know why Hemingway cracked
Sometimes truth is stranger than fiction
Life is the crummiest book I ever read
There isn't a hook
Just a lot of cheap shots, pictures to shock
And characters an amateur would never dream up
Sometimes truth is stranger than fiction
