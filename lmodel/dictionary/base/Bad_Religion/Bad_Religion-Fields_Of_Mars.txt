<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="Fields_Of_Mars">
In the garden where he was cast out by the lord
Flames an omnidirectional sword
For he as ever failed to gather up the fruit
And thus was banished with his loot
He cantered aimlessly through endless permutations of night
Seeking a purpose and the meaning of kin
And when it finally came to him
You could have mistook it for the meaning of sin
The women wished him well every time he cast off marching to hell
Now if you've never seen a terrible sight, stroll the garden of earthly delights
Maybe we can make it right someday
I'll see you high above the Fields of Mars
He knelt down before the unholy mob
And cried "war is god"
Gleaming outwardly with great pride
And prepared to die
The women wished him well every time he cast off marching to hell
Now if you've never seen a terrible sight, stroll the garden of earthly delights
Maybe we can make it right someday
I'll see you high above the Fields of Mars
High above the Fields of Mars
High above the Fields of Mars
High above the Fields of Mars
High above the Fields of Mars
Who cannot fight anymore
Will never love any less
That kid inside of murder
Must be committed
To live a life of hostility
Never asking what it means
When mother nation, blood and religion
Sanction killing upon the Fields of Mars
High above the Fields of Mars
High above the Fields of Mars
High above the Fields of Mars
High above the Fields of Mars
