<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="Markovian_Process">
You will all say
That I am surely crazy
Only an unrepentant pessimist
Whose thoughts should be detained
But facts are sterile
Not vulgar nor sublime
And they're not religion, they're for everyone
And signify the times
Today is a window
Tomorrow the landscape
All you need to do is take a look outside
To know what we're bound to face
The level of disparity, the common man
The manner of destruction of the native land
The poverty of reprisal from all involved
And the scathing trajectory from the past
Markovian process, lead us not in vain
Prove to our descendants what we did to them
Then make us go away
