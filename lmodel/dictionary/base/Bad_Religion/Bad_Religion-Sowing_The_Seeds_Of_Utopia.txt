<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="Sowing_The_Seeds_Of_Utopia">
We all know politicians only go
Just halfway there, just halfway there
The innocence of youth needs protection, not abuse
But no one seems to care, but no one seems to care
And you sit there and watch the world go around
From your pseudo-benevolent vantage point
While we who've been left to pick up after you
Try our best to make some sense for those who come next
Now what have you done to foster the truth?
Besides just hide the lies, besides just hide the lies?
A selfish campaign never justifies the gain
But the means are verified, yeah the means are verified
And you sit there and insist you are right
From your popular psychological podium
While those who rely and depend on you
They wilt because you don't accept we need each other
While sowing the seeds of Utopia
You invoked a convenient amnesia
You forgot how to care, you forgot how to provide
You forgot how to work toward a meaningful life
