<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="A_World_Without_Melody">
I don't want to live in a world without melody
Sometimes the rhythmic din of society is too much for me
But purpose is prioritized, these days the goal is win the prize
There's a sleeping resonance we hold through which we're unified
So let it out
Don't just get lost in the crowd
No one can deter you from your own path
There's no trip too remote from which you can't come back
And I've got this hunch about you and me
None of us are ready for a world without melody
Melody is the key
It's the surest way to unlock your individuality
Melody's the key
It'll set you free
Don't disrelish harmony, community will make you whole
Work and understanding are the chords way deep within your soul
They only need to be struck once and the vibrations swell and spread
But if we mute them they decay, our sensibilities are dead
So let it out
Don't just be one of the crowd
Hesitance and diffidence will do you in
And your soul doesn't care for social medicine
And I've got this hunch about you and me
None of us are ready for a world without melody
Melody is the key
It's the surest way to unlock your individuality
Melody's the key
It'll set you free
And I know together
We could change the world
Just you and me
But I won't live without melody
