<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="Blenderhead">
Flying through a dark prismatic tunnel on a carousel
The earth is turning and you know it very well
Your mind is reeling like ten helicopters wheeling
And you're gonna hit the ceiling like a mallet on a bell
Hey, blenderhead, they're starting to ask questions
Your transgressions are a danger flashing sign
Challenge conventions and radiate your splendor
And feel those flywheels churn your blenderhead
Tally up the gleaming ventured in a wishing well
Each shining trinket has a story it can tell
Your moments pining like those tales all intertwining
Can become the rusted lining of a deep neglected shell
Hey, blenderhead, you ask so many questions
Your confusion's a life-affirming sign
Break from tradition and carry on with valor
And feel those flywheels churn your blenderhead
