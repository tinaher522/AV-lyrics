<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="Won't_Somebody">
Out in the cold,
Like a bundle of coal,
Little packets of darkness,
Wanting to grow,
Well there's nobody home,
And there's a wreck in the yard,
And maybe they're coming back,
If we wish really hard,
If we wish real hard now,
Won't somebody please come up with something,
'cause Jesus just don't seem to be impartially working
And all of the rest are really down in the ratings,
But everyone is gonna keep on waiting,
Waiting for peace,
At the end of our streets,
Back behind our apartments,
In our passenger seats,
Just a moment of bliss,
Of it all of the ways,
But despair and oblivion,
Of our precarious ways,
Its ours to face now,
Won't somebody please come up with something,
'cause Jesus just don't seem to be impartially working,
And all of the rest are really down in the ratings,
But everyone is still right here waiting,
Now I know nothing lasts forever,
So we might as well wish for a God damn fix,
Of this toxic change in weather,
Won't somebody please come up with something,
'cause Jesus just don't seem to be impartially working
And all of the others can barely stay in the running,
But everyone is gonna keep on waiting
Won't somebody please come up with something
Won't somebody please come up with something
Won't somebody please come up with something
Won't somebody please come up with something
