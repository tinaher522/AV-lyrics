<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="Murder">
If you're discontent to know your world's a pile of shit
Listen to a riddle that will tickle every bit of it
Ha ha ha!
Ape shall not murder, ape wasn't so sure
Bad ape, you made a mistake, annihilation in a cannibal war
Well, cultivation might have served you, might have raised you up unscathed
If you had called that fucker by its name
Did you listen to the arbiter's beck and call?
Did you find what you were looking for or not at all?
Not at all!
Ape shall not murder, ape wasn't so sure
Bad ape, you made a mistake, annihilation in a cannibal war
Culture might have cured you and raised you up unscathed
If you had called that fucker by its name
Say the name
Say the name
Say the name
