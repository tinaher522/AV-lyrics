<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="Billy_Gnosis">
A crack developed and a name blew in
Billy Gnosis, weak and thin
He moved to California to start a new life
Because back in his hometown he just killed his wife
He started drinking heavy back then
He starting eating things that made his head trim
Then his brain became a factory
For making chemicals that shouldn't be
Oh Billy couldn't remember his name
Billy Gnosis was going insane
And soaked in blue light he played and played
I can still hear that sound he made
Billy burned his phone and blew up his car
He sat and watched TV and played the guitar
And read a book that made his head spin
How could he have known that there were worms within?
And the worms ate into his brain
Through his eyes and through his ears they came
They left their home so they'd multiply
And feed on Billy's chemicals in paradise
Oh Billy couldn't remember his name
Our unsung hero had gone insane
And soaked in blue light he played and played
The only thing that killed the worms: my brain
