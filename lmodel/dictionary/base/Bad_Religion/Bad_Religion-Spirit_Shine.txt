<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="Spirit_Shine">
Shed a tear for the criminal
Give him something to believe
Light a fire for the miserable
Give the darkness some meaning
Closed wounds harbor pestilence
When you lick them from within
Charity has a redolence
Chastity cannot rescind
Spirit shine, it's a sign
Of a tortured mind
Spirit shine all the time
Can render you blind
You can take it all to heart
Or throw it all away
You can call it just a lark
Or live your life that way
You can give until you're dry
And sucked of all your gleam
You can fake another try
And compromise your dream
Cling tight to the parable
Let it dominate your life
Create a god who's infallible
Give your leader some respite
Closed wounds harbor pestilence
When you lick them from within
Rosy smiles lose their radiance
When you take it on the chin
Spirit shine, it's a sign
Of a troubled mind
Spirit shine all the time
Can render you blind
Spirit shine, it's a sign
Of a tortured mind
Spirit shine all the time
Can render you blind
