<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="Raise_Your_Voice">
Fa fa fafa fa fa fafa
Raise your voice
Fa fa fafa fa fa fafa
Raise your voice
Fa fa fafa fa fa fafa
Raise your voice
Fa fa fafa fa fa fafa
Raise your voice
Don't be played like someone else's board game
Don't be classed out like some desolate redoubt
Don't be misled, you've got a lot on your head
And nobody's gonna pay attention when you are dead
So fa fa fafa fa fa fafa
Raise your voice
Fa fa fafa fa fa fafa
Raise your voice
Fa fa fafa fa fa fafa
Raise your voice
Fa fa fafa fa fa fafa
Raise your voice
It's the primary rule, you gotta want to be fooled
It's our daunted restraint that keeps us silent in shame
It's our nature to be adversarial and free
Our evolution didn't hinge on passivity
So fa fa fafa fa fa fafa
Raise your voice
Fa fa fafa fa fa fafa
Raise your voice
Fa fa fafa fa fa fafa
Raise your voice
Fa fa fafa fa fa fafa
Raise your voice
