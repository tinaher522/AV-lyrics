<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="Queen_Of_The_21st_Century">
From the time she could crawl she was all draped in macrame
She was preened and redeemed in a church that tried to show the way
She was taught to never ask for more
They had no idea of what she had in store
She's the queen of the 21st century
Just a ghost of what her parents thought a little girl should be
Analog heart, analog nerves, analog brain
But a fixture of the digital domain
From the time she could read she could see that there was urgency
No debate, just a spate of ignorance in a splintering community
She could never meet their expectations
Then she came to symbolize the nation
She's the queen of the 21st century
Just a shred of what her parents thought a little girl should be
Steeped in spite, coddled in fear, drenched in novelty
Oh, but masterful at sensual technology
She's the queen
She's the queen
No rules in her empire, she's the queen
Just libido and desire, she's the lean, mean fighting machine
The stuff of modern media lore
And she always knows the score
She's the queen of the 21st century
Just a ghost of what her parents thought a little girl should be
Fallen star, black and blue, broken hearts, wasted youth
Rusted cars, twisted roots, mental scars, the ugly truth
She's the queen of the 21st century
She's the queen of the 21st century
And she's a modern day polemic, a walking controversy
She's the queen of the 21st century
She's the queen of the 21st century
She's the queen of the 21st century
She's the queen
