<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="God's_Love">
Striking at mental apparitions like a drunk on a vacant street
Silently beset by the hands of time and elegant in its fury
An aberrant crack as skeletons yield to unrelenting gravity
While viruses prowl for helpless victims who succumb rapidly
Tell me, tell me where is the love in a careless creation when there's no above?
There's no justice, just a cause and a cure
And a bounty of suffering it seems we all endure
And what I'm frightened of is that they call it God's love
Well, we twist in torment and make believe
There's a truth that we all submit
Believe my eyes, my brain complies
To all that they interpret
So tell me, tell me where is the love in a careless creation when there's no above?
There's no justice, just a cause and a cure
And a bounty of suffering it seems we all endure
And what I'm frightened of is that they call it God's love
I know there's no reason for alarm
But who needs perspective when it comes to pain and harm?
We can change our minds
There's a better prize
But first you've got to tell me, tell me where is the love in a careless creation when there's no above?
There's no justice, just a cause and no cure
And a bounty of suffering it seems we all endure
And what I'm frightened of is that they call it God's love
They call it God's love
My pain is God's love
