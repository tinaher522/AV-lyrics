<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="Portrait_Of_Authority">
Nothing more, nothing less
An icon on the wall, decoration and duress
That which many strive to be
It's the marble statue staring over me
And nobody has the will to tear it down
It determines wrong and right
But to me it's just a stereotype
And it makes us lose our sight
The portrait of authority
You tell me that's what I'm supposed to be
Another time, another man
An oppressive intrusion, a plague across his land
And it haunts him every day
It tells him that he has no chance, his hopes just fade away
And he lives his life prepared to tear it down
But he can't muster the support
And to him it's just a stereotype
Of his life long fight
The portrait of authority
It embodies what he cannot be
