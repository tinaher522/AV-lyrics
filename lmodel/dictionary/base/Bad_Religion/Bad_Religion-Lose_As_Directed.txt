<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="Lose_As_Directed">
Little girl's eyes open wide
Two ways to go but you can't decide
Follows all the rules, has no say
Ends in somebody else's play
Close your eyes
'Cause you just don't need them anyway
Lose as directed, don't take no chance
Don't hinge your life upon circumstance
Mystery and misery go hand in hand
So you better follow the master plan
Don't use your head
Lose as directed
Little boy sitting in his master's arms
Safe and protected from any harm
Wants to be a man, wants to branch out
But he's told not to ask questions or doubt
Close your mind
It's a book of instructions now
Lose as directed, don't take no chance
Don't hinge your life upon circumstance
Mystery and misery go hand in hand
So you better follow the master plan
Don't use your head
Lose as directed
Lose as directed
Monkey see, monkey do
Just another animal in the zoo
Got four wall security
Never even have to read a recipe
But it's not
Exactly what you would call free
Lose as directed, don't take no chance
Don't hinge your life upon circumstance
Mystery and misery go hand in hand
So you better follow the master plan
Don't use your head
Lose as directed
