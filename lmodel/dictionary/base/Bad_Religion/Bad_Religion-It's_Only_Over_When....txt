<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="It's_Only_Over_When...">
You never know that feeling 'till you try
That healing feeling can turn you all about
And you can see the second wave of life
That losers triangle sets you down and out
Don't misread, and don't mislead
You could be your only friend
When the hammer comes down
And you don't hear a sound
You can look all around and see...
That it's only over when you give up!
