<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="To_Another_Abyss">
Not long ago, and yet the image is so vague
I hesitate to label it a memory
There was a show of local color and I felt astray
'Cause I had nothing to offer but insufficiency
And you know that it's a bitch when you learn to scratch that itch
A blatant fallibility, sooner to come, but eventually
All gets pointed in the same direction while the human masses and their vague conceptions
Obliterate each other with impunity and you wonder what's in this for me
To another abyss, to no avail, the search is bound to fail
To another abyss, to no avail, so long ago I set sail
And it chills me to the bone that I'm so far away from home
To another abyss
So what should I do now, what should I celebrate?
Given finite means and a penchant to depreciate?
How can I still avow and depend upon a state
That cares nothing for my happiness, welfare or fate?
And I know I can't explain the commotion in my brain
Like a terrifying reality, deconstructed but inadequately
All gets pointed in the same direction while the human masses and their vague conceptions
Obliterate each other with impunity and release the weight of history
To another abyss, to no avail, the search is bound to fail
To another abyss, to no avail, so long ago I set sail
And it chills me to the bone that I'm so far away from home
To another abyss
So long ago, so long ago, oh, I set sail
And I'm struggling on the way
And I'm waiting for the day
And I'm looking for the way back home
So far away
So far away
To another abyss, so far away
To another abyss
