<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="Ten_In_2010">
Parched cracked mouths, empty swollen guts
Sun baked pavement encroaches on us
Haves and have-nots together at last
Brutally engaged in mortal combat
Ten in 2010
Ten in 2010
What kind of God orchestrates such a thing?
Ten billion people all suffering
Truth is not an issue, just hungry mouths to feed
Forget what you want, scrounge the things you need
Ten in 2010
Ten in 2010
Happy and content it can't happen to you
Fifteen years, we'll think of a solution
It won't just appear in one day
For ten in 2010 we're well on our way
Ten in 2010
Ten in 2010
Like piercing ear darts, I heard the news today
Ten billion people coming your way
Ten in 20
Ten in 20
Ten in 2010
