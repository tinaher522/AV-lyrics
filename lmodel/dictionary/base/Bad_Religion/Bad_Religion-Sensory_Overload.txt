<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="Sensory_Overload">
This isn't art, this is suicide
In a social way
I don't have the need and I don't have the time
I'll tell you why
'Cause I think about it all the time
I think about what's true and what's lies
I used to think the things in my head were true
Sensory feedback from the things like you (2x)
I don't know why this must be
It's misleading me
I don't know why we've got a social suicide
Sensory overload, what a hell of a time
Gotta sensory overload, gotta tricky little mind
Tricky little mind, yeah
Go!
'Cause I think about the quivering flesh
I think about this urban mess
Think about playing these games for real
I wanna write down all the things I feel
I don't wanna hide from the things I hear
I don't know why this must be
The guitar's misleading me
I don't know why we've got a social suicide
Sensory overload, what a hell of a time
Gotta sensory overload, gotta tricky little mind
Tricky little mind, yeah
