<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="Past_Is_Dead">
Solemn regret, transgressions fill my head
A mesure of success is how well to forget
And the past is dead
Strewn about the battlefield of life are the reminders of history
When convenient we exalt them and pay them such respect
As if we're all in an equivalent trajectory
And trash pills high in the rubble we forget
The angels of our nature just sit and watch it rot
Now, the past is dead
Let's focus on tomorrow instead
On the tragic present said
The past is dead
Who can say what constitutes the most important sector of society?
The dominant portion seek an insant gratification
And are proud of intellectual poverty
I'd like to be empathetic but I can't
The jeopardy is too great to make a stand
Now the past is dead
Good deeds won't help you get ahead
The modern signpost read the past is dead
My next great decision is just lying in wait
The action might turn out to be world's mst grievous mistake
The past is dead
More vertable words have never been said
The tragic present said the past is dead
