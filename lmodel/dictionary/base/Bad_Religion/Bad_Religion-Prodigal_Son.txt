Oh, can't you feel the nostalgia, I wonder about you, modernistocrat Horatio Alger
Clever, never hesitating in the baiting, ever waiting for the canticle of manacles abating
Did you ever forget you had a regret?
And what you only guessed at might still be waiting
When the prodigal son with a caroming shadow of hate comes to land at home
Well, he's a mourning star with a champagne heart at his curtain call
And father never understood the way the work gets done
Don't look at me, no, I ain't one, no prodigal son
Don't look at me, no, I ain't one, no prodigal son
When everybody about is ready to bout you about controversial values
Don't you think you'd better readdress the level of the cowardice rising to drown you?
Did you ever connect or come to reject, or even inspect
The dreams that hound you?
When the prodigal son with a caroming shadow of hate comes to land at home
Well, he's a mourning star with a champagne heart at his curtain call
And father never understood the way the work gets done
Don't look at me, no, I ain't one, no prodigal son
Don't look at me, no, I ain't one, no prodigal son
When you least expect it, he's going to run
Like the blood-red path of the western sun
The prodigal son is waiting, waiting for his moment to come
Well hell no, don't look at me, can't you see I ain't one, no prodigal son
It ain't me, no I ain't one, no prodigal son
