<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="Follow_The_Leader">
A loose cannon on your shoulder 
You've got a strawberry on your hips 
And you've got some phantasmical images 
And you've got, you've got your rich hips 
Cos, you're all looking for adventure 
And you've got earphones on your bicycles 
There's people watching over 
And you got a bong in your pocket 
You could... 
Follow the leader 
Follow the leader 
Follow the leader 
Follow the leader 
Put some leader on the tape 
Give batman back his cape 
Don't ask for a sucker 
You stupid mother fucker 
I've got alot of problems 
Cos I sound like Beck 
What I do over in Germany 
Is order alot of Speck
You know what I'm talking about 
When you go home for dinner 
You gotta keep on your shoulder 
Follow the leader 
Follow the leader 
Follow the leader 
Follow the leader 
We're not the Foo Fighters 
On Saturday, we like our grinders
If you go home for pizza 
You kiss mother Theresa 
She is in her coffin 
Lady Diana's coffin
