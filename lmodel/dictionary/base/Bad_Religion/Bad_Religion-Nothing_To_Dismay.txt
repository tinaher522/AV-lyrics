<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="Nothing_To_Dismay">
Now, there's a list of catalysts
That hold the heart at bay
They grip the mind and sap the soul
And feed on your dismay
And I never understood why
You can't see the world this way
The lines are drawn at the break of dawn
There's nothing to dismay
It's no, no, no secrurity
No, no, no secrurity
No, no, no secrurity
Nothing to dismay
The dissonance runs deep in me
Resort to weak applause
Associate and denigrate
The root without a cause
And just because the overwhelming odds
Are stacked away
What good is should if at most I want?
But nothing to dismay
It's no, no, no secrurity
No, no, no secrurity
No, no, no secrurity
Nothing to dismay
Well, it's just a solo journey
Bewildered and astray
But pay no mind to what you find
There's nothing to dismay
No, no, no, no, no, no nothing to dismay
No, no, no security
Nothing to dismay
