<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="Kerosene">
Everywhere I look I see
Exclusive huddled uninviting
Shelter is a privilege
Of the sane and competent
Kerosene keeps me warm
I'm alone to watch it burn
Kerosene
Exposure
Is a pitiful and pointless way of dying
Before it gets me
I'll build a funeral pyre
Kerosene keeps me warm
I'm alone to watch it burn
Kerosene
I'm a man and my dignity won't wave
Tonight buildings rage
Kerosene keeps me warm
Feels so good to watch it burn
Kerosene
Kerosene keeps me warm
I'm alone to watch it burn
Kerosene
Kerosene keeps me warm
Feels so good to watch it burn
Kerosene
Kerosene keeps me warm
Feels so good to watch it burn
Kerosene
