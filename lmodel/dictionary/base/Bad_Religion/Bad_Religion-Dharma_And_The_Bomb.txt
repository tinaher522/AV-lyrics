<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="Dharma_And_The_Bomb">
Wasted days and cigarettes
Cracked cement and palms
Bodhidharma has gone fission
With your vedic mom
Yeah, the sergeant major is dreamin' of a genie
And she's armed with a borrowd polka dot bikini
Oh yeah, tomorrow's coming downlike Dharma and the bomb
Falling down
Falling down
Like Dharma and the bomb
Falling down
Falling down
Like Dharma and the bomb
The shallows seem evangelical
When you're slammed up against a wall
And your stoked to watch all creation go over the falls
Yeah, Kali is coming and you'd better believe it
That girl's got the atom and the Baghavad Ghita
Oh yeah, Samsara's coming down like Dhamrma and the bomb
Falling down
Falling down like
Like Dhamra and the bomb
Falling down
Falling down like
Like Dhamra and the bomb
