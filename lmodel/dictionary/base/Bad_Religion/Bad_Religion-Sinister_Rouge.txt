<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="Sinister_Rouge">
Innocents burned alive at the stake
Tortured and dumped in nameless graves
Centuries waned, authority died
Scattering seeds of ancient lies
Sinister rouge coming back for more
To even the score
Sinister rouge coming back for more
To even the score
Child molesters and Jesuits
Holding secret conference
Underneath the Pontiff's nose
And only God will ever know
Sinister rouge coming back for more
To even the score
Sinister rouge coming back for more
To even the score
Give us this day our daily bread
Your legacy we'll not forget
Lick the wounds, cleanse the land
The modern world rejects your hand
Sinister rouge coming back for more
To even the score
Sinister rouge coming back for more
To even the score
The nightmare comes in sinister rouge
