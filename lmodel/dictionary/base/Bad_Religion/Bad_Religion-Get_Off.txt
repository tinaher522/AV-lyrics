<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="Get_Off">
Lascivious
It's all that I can think of as I drag my feet, searching like Diogenes
Dangerous
The adjective of the decade and of your alluring intricacies
Yes, I see your green-screen mentality
And I feel the sting of its consequence
And I know I shouldn't but it's too much to ignore
An emotion I deplore
Every time I look at you
I just wanna do it
I can clench my fist right through it
But I just wanna get off
Rectilinear
The direction we've been heading, never realizing we are on a runaway machine
Angular
The momentum that does turn us one step further on our ladder, one more turn toward the east
I realize your green-screen mentality
And I know it's shared by many more
And I know it's quite impossible but I am damned to find a way
To revolve the other way
Every time I scrutinize
I just say screw it
We're on a ride down a blind conduit
And I just want to get off
