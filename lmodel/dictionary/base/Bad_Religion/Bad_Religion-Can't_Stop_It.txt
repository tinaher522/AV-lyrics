<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="Can't_Stop_It">
I'm incurable but durable, it's easy to see
Lack of restraint is a complaint of those around me
I know that others postpone
Gratification, well I lack that affectation
Let's get it right
There's no end in sight
And I can't stop, can't stop it, can't stop, can't stop it
Can't stop, it's shocking but I just can't stop it
Uncontrollable, I'm inconsolable
My pleasure center is the shelter for a reptile
I hate when I gotta tolerate
Frustration, see I lack the motivation
Let's set this straight
I never wait
And I can't stop, can't stop it, can't stop, can't stop it
Can't stop, it's shocking but I just can't stop it
