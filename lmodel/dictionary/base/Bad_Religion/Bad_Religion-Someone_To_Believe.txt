<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="Someone_To_Believe">
Dark, frozen, hibernation held at bay 
As your mind, left behind, lost another day
But finally there’s someone to believe
Anti-social boredom is all the rage but the time comes when you gotta turn the page 
And then finally there’s someone to believe
And now you walk with confidence and ease
And there’s no call to sell your soul or confess or drop down to your knees
Who, what, or where made you change your mind? 
Doesn’t matter anymore ‘cuz you’ve seen a sign
And now finally there’s someone to believe
Searching for the answer’s a lonely quest but the act is liable to bring out your best
And then finally there’s someone to believe
And now you have a purpose to proceed
And you find out the baggage that you discarded, you didn’t even need
No one can deny a return to form irrespective of the morass, shame, and scorn
But then finally there’s someone to believe
Ready to emerge and direct your fate as the self-determination radiates because finally there’s someone to believe
And now you walk with confidence and ease
And it feels like the spring equinox after a long winter’s sleep
Finally, there’s someone to believe
