<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="Them_And_Us">
Despite that he saw blatant similarity, he struggled to find a distinctive moiety
All he found was vulgar superficiality
But he focused it to sharpness and shared it with the others
It signified his anger and his misery
Them and us, lobbying determined through a mire of disbelievers
Them and us, dire perpetuation and incongruous insistence
That there really is a difference between them and us
Hate is a simple manifestation of a deep-seated self-directed frustration
All it does is promote fear and consternation
It's the inability to justify the enemy
And it fills us all with trepidation
Them and us, bending the significance to match a whimsied fable
Them and us, tumult for the ignorant and purpose for the violence
A confused loose alliance forming them and us
And I heard him say we can take them all
We can take them all
We can take them all, that's what he said
We can take them all
But he didn't know who we were and he didn't know who they were
And there wasn't any reason or motive or value to his story
Just allegory, imitation glory
And a desperate feeble search for a friend
Them and us, lobbying determined through a mire of disbelievers
Them and us, dire perpetuation and incongruous insistence
Tumult for the ignorant and purpose for the violence
A confused loose alliance forming them and us
We can take them all
We can take them all
