<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="The_Empire_Strikes_First">
We strike first
And we're unrehearsed
Here we go again to stage the greatest show on heaven and earth
Come on, get your money's worth
Don't wanna live, can't live
Don't wanna give, can't give
Don't wanna be, won't be
E-M-P-I-R-E
Can't live, don't wanna live
Can't give, don't wanna be
Won't be E-M-P-I-R-E
We're coming on fast
And we're built to last
We stumbled once in 'Nam but we're glad to finally say those days have passed
Tell me how long can it last
Don't wanna live, can't live
Don't wanna give, can't give
Don't wanna be, won't be
E-M-P-I-R-E
Can't live, don't wanna live
Can't give, don't wanna be
Won't be E-M-P-I-R-E
We just started out
You don't need to be afraid
Yeah, you deserve two minutes hate
Well we spit and we cursed
And our bleeding hearts burst
But even ten million souls marching in February couldn't stop the worst
C-c-c-couldn't reverse
Don't wanna live, can't live
Don't wanna give, can't give
Don't wanna be, won't be
E-M-P-I-R-E
Can't live, don't wanna live
Can't give, don't wanna be
Won't be E-M-P-I-R-E
I can't live if it isn't with you
