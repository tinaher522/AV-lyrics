Early man walked away as modern man took control
Their minds weren't all the same, to conquer was his goal
So he built his great empire and he slaughtered his own kind
Then he died a confused man, killed himself with his own mind
Early man walked away as modern man took control
Their minds weren't all the same, to conquer was his goal
So he built his great empire and he slaughtered his own kind
Then he died a confused man, killed himself with his own mind
Early man walked away as modern man took control
Their minds weren't all the same, to conquer was his goal
So he built his great empire and he slaughtered his own kind
Then he died a confused man, killed himself with his own mind
We're only gonna die from our own arrogance
We're only gonna die from our own arrogance
We're only gonna die from our own arrogance
We're only gonna die from our own arrogance
