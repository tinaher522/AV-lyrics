<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="The_Resist_Stance">
Seeds of rebellion lay outside your front door
If you nourish them and water them they'll grow into a healthy "what for?"
And if revolution isn't what's in store, how can you care anymore?
It's a dangerous slip, a conscientious shift
In the spirit of resistance you gotta hold your grip 
Lest the state of your resolve makes you quickly devolve to a fundamentalist
You're an archetype that they can pin to the wall 
When you cling to your convictions like a farm animal in its stall
Never thinking of the bigger world outside, as they take you for a ride
It's a dangerous slip, a conscientious shift
In the spirit of resistance you gotta hold your grip
Because passion unabated can be readily conflated with belligerence
It's a dangerous slip and a conscientious shift
In the spirit of resistance you gotta hold your grip
And the verdict won't be kind, cuz they're desperate for a viable alternative.
Take a stance. The resist stance. 
Take a stance. The resist stance. 
Take a stance. The resist stance. 
Take a stance. The resist stance!
