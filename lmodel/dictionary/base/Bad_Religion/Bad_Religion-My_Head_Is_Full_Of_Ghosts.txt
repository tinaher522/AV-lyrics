<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="My_Head_Is_Full_Of_Ghosts">
My head is full of ghosts
But I'm no revenant
Despite my resident's rivalry
And I'll be the faithful pilot
On our blind trajectory
Do you want to know a secret
Will you hold it close and dear
This will not be apparent
But you and I are not alone in here
My head is full of ghosts
No apparition
A partition from the host
A temple of cognition
And forbidden to approach
Oh to hell with superstition
There's a stranger in the house
I don't need no exorcism
I need a key
And the lock is inside out
Now meta-cognition is just intuition
And dreamers we'll bark at the moon
The weaver's unknown by the loom
My head is full of ghosts
And I'm the pilot
Of ultra-violent ancestry
And I'll destroy these passers-by
With zest and artistry
Ghost!
Part apparition
A partition from the host
A temple of cognition
And forbidden to approach
