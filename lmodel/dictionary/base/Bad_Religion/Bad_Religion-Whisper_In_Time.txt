<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="Whisper_In_Time">
All those stories that my dad told me
They are just a whisper in time
All those things that never came to be
They are just a whisper in time
A whisper in time, a whisper in time
Things that I can't shake from my mind
A whisper in time, a whisper in time
Moments that just flicker and die
All those places I wanted to go
They are just a whisper in time
All those friends who now I do not know
They are just a whisper in time
A whisper in time, a whisper in time
Moments I can't shake from my mind
A whisper in time, a whisper in time
Memories that flicker and die
Maps and roads that brought me here today
They are just a whisper in time
Circumstances that were explained away
They are just a whisper in time
A whisper in time, a whisper in time
Things that I can't shake from my mind
A whisper in time, a whisper in time
Moments that just flicker and die
Because we are messengers of memory
Just whispers in time
