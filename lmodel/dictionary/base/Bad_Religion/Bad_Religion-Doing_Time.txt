<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="Doing_Time">
See the fight
Old men crying, deny their ruin
Watch them try
The cynic laughs at the optimist's closed eyes
Darkness falls, curtain calls, the cynic's beer soon overflows
Other watches, has a seat, and from the same cup, they drink
I'm doing time, how long I don't know
William had 26
Blew his brains out, now look at him
John had only one
Watch the mother mourn her only son
I'm doing time, how long I don't know
I'll kiss goodbye my brain and body
And go to sleep for generations
And go to sleep for generations
Salvation
Cease concentration
You'll only lose the fight
Don't tell me what's wrong or right
You're losing sight
You're just gonna die anyway
