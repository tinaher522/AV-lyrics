<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="Beyond_Electric_Dreams">
No one here can show you where it is but they can point to a sign
On the roof of the world without apparent design
The frozen definition of a lunatic ambition to rise
The air is dead, the future dim, dimension hard to find
Upon a mountain encased in solar rays
Beyond electric dreams of inarticulate passion plays
Coming down a mountain, eons have a human reign
The conversation of impassive planets intercepted by a human being
Ratiocination is a practicable way to derive
An attitude of altitude, authority by which to abide
Or maybe a theophany of flaming creosote in disguise
Reality's dead, the future is still, the match is hard to find
Up on a mountain encased in solar rays
Beyond electric dreams of inarticulate passion plays
Coming down a mountain, eons of a human reign
The conversation of impassive planets intercepted by a human being
geographic co-worker in the crumbling geometry of night
a torturing form that traces faceless theories
Of a superhuman imagination in a patch of sand
There were raptures guided with every intensity
I'm only a visitor in an atom of atoms
On a jutting red spattered synagogue of granite
Imigrants crowded literally in space
Disposure, demoral, giant
Things in heaven work forever
(live, live, live, live)
let's go where the raptor goes
Cause I'm melting in a cosmic glow
We'll have a genuine terrestrial show
On a mountain, on a mountain
Let's scan the horizon clean
Of any trace of a human schemes
It's a terrestrial immoral gene
On a mountain, on a mountain
up on a mountain
(let's go where the record goes)
eons of a human reign
(Cause I'm melting in a cosmic glow)
The conversation of impassive planets
(We'll have a genuine terrestrial show)
Intercepted by the human being
(On a mountain, on a mountain)
up on a mountain
(Let's scan the horizon clean)
encased in solar rays
(of any trace of a human schemes)
beyond electric dreams
(It's a terrestrial immoral gene)
on a mountain, on a mountain
(On a mountain, on a mountain)
up on a mountain
(let's go where the record goes)
eons of a human reign
(Cause I'm melting in a cosmic glow)
The conversation of impassive planets
(We'll have a genuine terrestrial show)
on a mountain, on a mountain
(On a mountain, on a mountain)
up on a mountain
(Let's scan the horizon clean)
encased in solar rays
(of any trace of a human schemes)
beyond electric dreams
(It's a terrestrial immoral gene)
on a mountain, on a mountain
(On a mountain, on a mountain)
up on a mountain
(let's go where the record goes)
eons of a human reign
(Cause I'm melting in a cosmic glow)
The conversation of impassive planets
(We'll have a genuine terrestrial show)
on a mountain
