<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="Changing_Tide">
Every day's the same routine
Of endless chores and boring details
And you know you're waiting for
The perfect condition for your ship to set sail
But of course the climate's changing
Clinging to the past has got you straining
Comes the recognition now
You're on a mission that is born to fail
(Leave it!)
Brothers say goodbye
Sisters don't you cry
All embrace the times
Wade into the changing tide
Searching of philosophy of life
Can be a drag on the soul
Nowaday we pick and choose
The pieces from other people's wisdom of old
But of course the climate's changing
Clinging to the past has got you straining
Realizing all your most cherished beliefs
Are subjet to rot and mold
(Come on!)
Brothers say goodbye
Sisters don't you cry
All embrace the times
Wade into the changing tide
