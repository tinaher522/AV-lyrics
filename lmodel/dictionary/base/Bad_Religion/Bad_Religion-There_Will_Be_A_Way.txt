<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="There_Will_Be_A_Way">
Shut your eyes, see the future's distant shore
March ahead more enlightened than before
And there's sure to be bumps and distractions but I know we'll get through
There will be me, there will be you, there will be a way
Unresolved repercussions from your life
Fortified with the vitriol of strife
And you can be gridlocked by predictions, but you're wise, grab the prize
Then revise, realize there will be a way
There will be a way
And I don't know where we are going
But you're here on this ride
And we'll stand side by side
All along the way
Follow me to the future's distant shore
Vagary needn't haunt us anymore
And now it's time to set the agenda, learn the past, make it last
Share the wealth, hold your fire, conserve life, make it right
Kill the hate, negotiate, there will be a way
There will be a way
There will be a way
There will be a way
There will be a way
