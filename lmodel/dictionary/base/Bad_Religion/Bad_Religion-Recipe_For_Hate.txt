<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="Recipe_For_Hate">
Can't you feel it, can't you see
The promise of prosperity?
It's overwhelming you and me
It afflicts us like a disease
Ubiquitous, compelling too
We cling to you like crazy glue
And inject such a potent seed
It's best for all humanity
The spread of culture, the sword of progress
The vector of suffrage, a warm and septic breeze
The pomp and elation, the duty and vocation
The blood of the hybrid, it's just a recipe
Reliving our ancestry
The frightful lack of harmony
Our forefathers who led the way
Their victims are still here today
Now it's time to erase
The story of our bogus fate
Our history as it's portrayed
Is just a recipe for hate
A recipe for hate
The spread of culture, the sword of progress
The vector of suffrage, a warm and septic breeze
The pomp and elation, the duty and vocation
The blood of the hybrid, it's just a recipe
