<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="The_Answer">
Long ago in a dusty village full of hunger, pain, and strife
A man came forth with a vision of truth and the way to a better life
He was convinced he had the answer and he compelled people to follow along
But the hunger never vanished and the man was banished and the village dried up and died
At a time when wise men peered through brass tubes toward the sky
The heavens changed in predictable ways and one man was able to find
That he thought he had found the answer and he was quick to write his revelation
But as they were scrutinized, in his colleagues' eyes he soon became a mockery
Don't tell me about the answer 'cause then another one will come along soon
I don't believe you have the answer, I've got ideas too
But if you've got enough naivety and you've got conviction
Then the answer is perfect for you
An urban sprawl sits choking on its discharge, overwhelmed by industry
Searching for a modern day savior from another place, inclined toward charity
Everyone's begging for an answer without regard to validity
The searching never ends, it goes on and on and on for eternity
Don't tell me about the answer 'cause then another one will come along soon
I don't believe you have the answer, I've got ideas too
But if you've got enough naivety and you've got conviction
Then the answer is perfect for you
The answer is perfect for you
