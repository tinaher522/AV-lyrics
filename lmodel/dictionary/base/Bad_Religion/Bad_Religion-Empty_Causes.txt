<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="Empty_Causes">
Everywhere you looked there was confusion, violence, drama, and drugs
So many righteous revolutionaries spouting utopian love
Everyone shrouded in purple haze, then one day they woke up from their dream state
They found themselves no more at peace than before, older, meek and comformed
Empty causes
A bluster for the soul, a fix for the mind
Empty causes
Cling to everything you find
Well, the shots rang out like popcorn and the chief was hit and rushed out of sight
The mohawk chain leather brigade rejoiced maliciously on that night
Someone cried out "fuck the government," his mates couldn't define what he meant
So no one gave him the time of day and the scene died away
Empty causes
A war for the body, an army in the mind
Empty causes
Losing steam as time goes by
Could it be that everybody selfishly desires
Their own personal retinue?
And that causes are just manifestations of too much time
And far too little to do?
Empty causes
Direction for the soul, conviction for the mind
Empty causes
Cling to it all, everything you find
Empty causes
A war for the body and an army in the mind
Empty causes
You've got yours and I've got mine
