<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="Forbidden_Beat">
There was a boy who had too many toys
And an ache inside of his bones
He sought extrication through chemical vocation
And now he answers to Jones
It's deadly and alluring
The sound of pounding heat
Enslaving all who dare succumb
To the temptations of the forbidden beat
Thinking today of what I want to say
Thinking of inhibition and vice
What they call straight I do relegate
As I cautiously saltate along
It's deadly and alluring
The sound of pounding heat
Enslaving all who dare succumb
To the temptations of the forbidden beat
It thunders away at first light of each day
And the simpleton lifestyle evolves
But soon enters dusk as the last surrey rusts
And a new day upon us results
It's deadly and alluring
The sound of pounding heat
Enslaving all who dare succumb
To the temptations of the forbidden beat
Forbidden beat
Forbidden beat
Forbidden beat
Forbidden beat
Forbidden beat
Forbidden beat
Forbidden beat
