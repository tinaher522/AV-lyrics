<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="Avalon">
As the sun comes creeping up the mountain and the wind blows over from the sea
Hey, we’re brought into this land like tiny particles of sand, unsure of who we’re smarter than, or what we’re meant to be
Oh the grains sift coarsely through the hour glass and collect like their victims in the bowl
The ungodly force of change erodes all sense of earthly gains
While tending to the mundane will terrorize your soul
And it’s no! It’s no use thinking that you’re wrong
The past is old and gone
It’s best to move along and find your Avalon
Well, I wish that I could tell you it was easy, just take the paved road right to paradise
But the truth is my friend, the pain and suffering never ends
Make amends with medicine, amnesia, and lies
The grains sift coarsely through the hour glass and they pound like boulders on the brain
All those things you did for fun, never hurting anyone, careless shadows in the sun, just empty and lame
And it’s no... it’s no use thinking that you’re wrong
The past is old and gone
It’s best to move along and find your Avalon
It’s no use thinking that you’re wrong
The past is dead and gone
It’s best to move along and find your Avalon
So now the day races from the twilight
How the fields are enveloped by the shade
And the story that you’ll tell, inventory of your well, crack the shell and find the mortar silted and decayed
And it’s no! It’s no use thinking that you’re wrong
The past is dead and gone
It’s best to move along and find your Avalon
It’s best to hurry on and find your Avalon
