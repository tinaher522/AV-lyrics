<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="Universal_Cynic">
Catch a shooting star and put it in your pocket 
And your pants will start on fire 
One bird in the hand, or two birds in the bush 
Neither do you any good, when you're stuck in the quagmire 
Show everyone you're not sure that they're telling the truth 
Then you can be known as the universal cynic too 
Benefit your fellow man with good deeds for the day 
And you'll serve your life away 
Pennies saved today are pennies still tomorrow 
Strewn upon the desk, piled up in the paper weight 
Show everyone you're not sure that they're telling the truth 
Then you can be known as the universal cynic too 
Wipe your opaque eyes and restore your crystal vision 
Turn another cheek and exalt in your decision 
A bit of exercise for the universal cynic in you 
Early to bed and early to rise 
Precludes you from seeing the most brilliant starry nights 
Sticks and stones can break bones, words can't really hurt 
Unless you carry guns, and are hungry for a fight 
Challenging the standards, or questioning the established rules 
Trying to understand how they can benefit you 
Showing everyone you're not sure that they're telling the truth 
Just a bit of exercise for the universal cynic in you 
The universal cynic is you
