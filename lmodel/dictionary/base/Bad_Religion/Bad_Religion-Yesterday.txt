<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="Yesterday">
Run, but don't be scared to look behind
Stop, don't wait too long, make up your mind
The end is almost here
The sky, the air, so nice and clear
The sound of your decay
And the ringing in the air is the sweet debris of yesterday
There, now that you know it's not so bad
See, the good meet soon for lots of air
So if you try to enhance
We don't deserve another chance
Just laugh along the way
And kiss your ass goodbye with a shadow dream of yesterday
Yesterday, the good old days
Yesterday, the way we used to play
Yesterday, it just got worse and worse
Yesterday, the future's been rehearsed
Run, but don't be scared to look behind
Stop, don't wait too long, make up your mind
The end is almost here
The sky, the air, so nice and clear
The sound of your decay
And the ringing in the air is the sweet debris of yesterday
Yesterday
Yesterday
