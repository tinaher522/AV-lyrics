<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="Epiphany">
A new age of reason, brains treason to trick the mind
What good is searching if nothing's there to find?
We arrive at this place of no return, my brothers
Only to discover that our minds have led us away so far from the painful truth of who we are
What's right is wrong, what's come has gone, what's clear and pure is not so sure
It came to me
All promises become a lie, all that's benign corrupts in time
The fallacy of epiphany
Come forth, bear witness, see the profit from your loss
Beg for forgiveness only after you tally the cost
We arrive at this place of no return, my sisters
Only to discover that our values ran us aground on the shore, in the sea of what we could be
What's right is wrong, what's come has gone, what's clear and pure is not so sure
It came to me
All promises become a lie, all that's benign corrupts in time
The fallacy of epiphany
If it's real to me, do I have to prove it to you?
Why do revelations fade to cold blue untruths?
It's oh so relative
Subservient in total to one's perspective
What's right is wrong, what's come has gone, what's clear and pure is not so sure
It came to me
All promises become a lie, all that's benign corrupts in time
The fallacy of epiphany
Always failing me
