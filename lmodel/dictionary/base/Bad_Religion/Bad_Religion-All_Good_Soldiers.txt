<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="All_Good_Soldiers">
All good soldiers crack like boulders
The sun climbs up to a razon, violins
New boots and numbers on a chain
All good soldiers
All good soldiers fall in line when they march and shout
All good soldiers are a spectacle, marching and singing
They'll go anywhere the president says
Because the president believes in God like all good soldiers should
All good soldiers wait like warheads
When the fighting starts, who will be accountable?
A cannibal, a cannonball
All good soldiers, all soldiers
All good soldiers fall in line when they march and shout
All good soldiers are a spectacle, marching and singing
They'll go anywhere the president says
Because the president believes in God like all good soldiers should
It's six AM, I can see my breath
And the clay dirt is laughing at the weakling boy
Today is the day that I'll write my friends
It's something I've been trying to remember
I had a dream of a wall
That was twenty-one stories tall
All good soldiers fall in line when they march and shout
All good soldiers are a spectacle, marching and singing
They'll go anywhere the president says
Because the president believes in God like all good soldiers should
