<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="The_Grand_Delusion">
I could only get the tools, the stimuli and molecules
Frozen moments in time
I could be the archetype, a credit to the genotype
Reprogram your mind
But the storybook sages fill their pages
Hiding from the warming sun
Limitless distractions give no pause
To distort a precious delusion
Delusion
Precious delusion
Did you see the moralist retort and raise his fist?
You can't make a man a machine
I can see the edifice crumbling in foggy mist
Razed by discovery
But the storybook sages fill their pages
Hiding from the warming sun
Limitless distractions give no pause
To distort a precious delusion
Delusion
Precious delusion
Delusion
