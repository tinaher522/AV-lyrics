<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="Cyanide">
Well let me bend your ear
Because I'm never really there
When shadows turns to light
And hope into despair
There was an only one
But the broody skies above
Brought down a shameful stain
And not a single drop of cleaning rain
Let me say
(Oh oh) well there's no place left to hide
(Oh oh) from the loneliness inside
The road to you is paved right through with bloody good intentions
And missin' you is like kissin'
Cyanide
Well in this world of things
One of them is lost
I've been it in my dreams
But not without a cost
Down a lonely street
It was our destiny to meet
Nobody asked you twice
We found purchase then with no requite (nothing nice)
(Oh oh) well there's no place left to hide
(Oh oh) from the loneliness inside
The road to you is paved right through with bloody good intentions
And missin' you is like kissin'
Cyanide
Would you believe in something good that's so wrong
And have you worshiped our invention
Well I've paid my debt in coin and sweat with trifling hesitation
Because the road to you is paved with good intentions
(Oh oh) well there's no place left to hide
(Oh oh) from the loneliness inside
The road to you is paved right through with bloody good intentions
And missin' you is like kissin'
Cyanide
Cyanide
Cyanide
Cyanide
Cyanide
Cyanide
Cyanide
Cyanide
