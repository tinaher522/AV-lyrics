<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="Vanity">
I'll strike it if I don't like it
Dimme a club and I will have myself a riot
I'm a monkey with a brick on my shoulder
And I'm getting bolder
Let's deny and defame
Let's destroy and recreate in our glorious name
And when the joke of our centrality is upon us
Grovel and decry
Our vanity
Disgraced to face our own humanity
In a world that mocks our tragedy
Hyper-aware and impaired
Terrified by natures mocking stare
Yearning for significance beyond our animal ken
On which we do depend
Such vanity 
Isolated with our own inanity
Entangled by our callow gravity
Disgraced to face our own humanity
