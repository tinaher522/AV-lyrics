<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="The_Devil_In_Stitches">
(Hey) angels fall down without warning
Cherry lipstick on their teeth and all dangerous curves
She had a bullet proof mind and big pawn shop eyes
And nothing you could say would get to her
So don't look homeward angel from that rumble seat
I can strum twice and make it all go away
We'll tap every last drop until that beating stops
And let the devil come join us dancing
Across the yellow sun
We'll run
Because the devil in stitches only has his fun
Performing for the chosen one
We can run
She was living on the edge of a knife
His head was filled with restless ghosts
It's so easy to love a bringer of destruction
She said "Darling, I love you madly"
Black tear stained cheeks behind her shattered window
Prayin' for a song to save her life
I had a paperback crime running straight down my spine
So let the devil come join us dancing
Across the yellow sun
We'll run
While the devil in stitches goes and has his fun
Performing for the chosen one
We can run
Wild in the street like a formal procession of love and deceit
I will carry you home like a bride from the wreckage
Here's your punch drunk cupid knocked clean out of the senses
I know he drove her out out to the brink
That's where they stood and looked down
Right then he made a decision
That's where they made a division
Declaring war on the weather
A reckless pact with forever
So come on and sing
Sing hallelujah
Right now
