<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="Suffer">
Did you ever see the concrete stares of everyday?
The lunatic, the hypocrite, are all lost in the fray
Can't you see their lives are just like yours?
An unturned stone, an undiscovered
Door leading to
The gift of hope renewed
Eternity for you
The masses of humanity have always had to suffer
The businessman whose master plan controls the world each day
Is blind to indications of his species' slow decay
Can't you see his life is just like yours?
An unturned stone, an undiscovered
Door leading to
The gift of hope renewed
Eternity for you
The masses of humanity have always had to suffer
People blow their minds, they choose to resign
This deformed society is part of the design
It'll never go away, it's in the cards that way
The masses of humanity have always, always had to suffer
A door leading to
The gift of hope renewed
Eternity for you
The masses of humanity, still clinging to their dignity
The masses of humanity will always
Always have to suffer
Always have to suffer
