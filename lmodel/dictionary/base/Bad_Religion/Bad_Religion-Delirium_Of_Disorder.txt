<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="Delirium_Of_Disorder">
Delirium of disorder
Delirium of disorder
Life is the sieve through which my anarchy strains
Resolving itself into works
Chaos is the score upon which reality is written
The timeless, swirling gyroscopic horde
Delirium
Delirium of disorder
Yeah, I am just an atom in an ectoplasmic sea
Without direction or a reason to exist
The anechoic nebula rotating in my brain
Is persuading me contritely to persist
Delirium of disorder
Delirium of disorder
Delirium of disorder
Delirium of disorder
Delirium of disorder
Delirium of disorder
Delirium of disorder
Delirium of disorder
