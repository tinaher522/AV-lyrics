It's a long way to the promised land
So you'd better well know your way
There's a ship on the ocean and an albatross
Who is trying to lead you astray
Leaders, politicians and power whores
Are in line to receive your choice
You can bet your ass if you give it to them
They will gladly take your voice
And it's a long way to the promised land
It's a long way to the promised land
It's a long way to the promised land
If we work we might find it here
There's no substitute for enlightenment
There's no reason for bridled fear
When you join the people who've joined the club
You gotta clench and play your hand
'Cause if you fall in line you're gonna fall in time
And you'll never make a stand
And it's a long way to the promised land
It's a long way to the promised land
What are you going to do
When they call for you?
Bend and capitulate
Or keep your head on straight?
Easy answers bought without experience
Gonna lead you to certain doom
Because the truth is just what you make of it
It begins and ends with you
It's a long way to the promised land
It's a long way to the promised land
When you join the people who've joined the club
You gotta clench and play your hand
Because the truth is just what you make of it
It's a long way, get in line
