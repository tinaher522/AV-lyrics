<song artist="Bad_Religion" title="Slaves">
Don't try to say that I threaten your freedom
We've done without for 20 years, so think if we really need 'em
We're all just slaves for the troop commanders (3x)
We're all slaves
We can blow up things better than in any country except this one
Waiting for it too then you realize it ain't too much fun
We're in a country, democracy, supposed to be the best on the globe
Living from the denoument lifted from the high class clones and
We're all just slaves for the system masters (3x)
We're all slaves
And we're all just slaves for the system masters
We're all slaves
