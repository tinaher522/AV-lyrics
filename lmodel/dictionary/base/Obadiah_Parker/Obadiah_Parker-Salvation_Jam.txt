<song artist="Obadiah_Parker" title="Salvation_Jam">
I've been wondering why nothing ever gets to me 
I've been hearing nothing now for far too long 
I can hardly stand to sit for one more word 
I've been counting seconds 'til I can leave 
Won't you let me, let me leave 
I've been thinking that maybe this is all my fault 
Maybe thinking is the thing that got me where I am now 
Let my mind wander to the desert where it's all alone 
Can I hold on to what I know? 
Sometimes, I don't think so 
Pull back the curtain to find that I am not what you thought 
And see that what I think is not what you taught 
I know all the words I play in all the right keys 
Don't be surprised when you find out that you've been deceived 
Lately I've grown sick of what's been going on 
It seems that I lose control every time I'm alone 
And I won't talk about anything with anyone 
Even though I know there's nothing I can do 
But the question is can I depend on you? 
Pull back the curtain to find that I am not what you thought 
And see that what I think is not what you taught 
I know all the words I play in all the right keys 
Don't be surprised when you find out that you've been deceived 
Oh Lord, send me back again 
When love was all I'd need 
Oh Lord, send it back again 
The joy of my salvation 
Oh Lord, send me back again 
To a day when I was free 
Oh, Lord, if only I knew then 
Once you start you can't never stop
