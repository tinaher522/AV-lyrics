<song artist="Obadiah_Parker" title="The_Sound_Check_Song">
This is a sound check 
This is where we check the sound 
Of complex explanations for the tragedies in which we drown 
This is a sound check 
I can hear my resolve snap as our bodies bend 
I don't think I could tell you where I wanted this to end 
Trying hard not to think of anything but her skin 
Everyone makes mistakes sometimes, 
At the moment I'm just cashing mine in 
Close my eyes and find a groove 
Let myself go, begin to move 
The further I drift away from shore 
All I want is more 
She's asking me if I want to stop, 
But the last thing that I want to do is talk 
About what it is that I really want and why 
There's a pain in my chest that's beginning to burn like sin 
And I'm beginning to wonder if we're ever gonna get out 
Of the mess we're in 
Close my eyes and find a groove 
Let myself go, begin to move 
The further I drift away from shore 
All I want is more 
You don't have to testify 
When no one ever asks you why 
It's not hard to justify 
When you've never told a lie 
This is a sound check 
It's where we check the sound 
Of justifications and apologies so profound 
This is a sound check 
This is a sound check 
This is where we check the sound 
Of complex explanations for the tragedies in which we drown 
Thanks for coming to the sound check
