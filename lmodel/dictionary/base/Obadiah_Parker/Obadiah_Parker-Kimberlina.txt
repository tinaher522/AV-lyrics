<song artist="Obadiah_Parker" title="Kimberlina">
I met her below Yosemite, just south of the sky 
At the foot of a piano, just before we said goodbye 
I would live my life between the desert and the pine 
If I could drive forever down Highway 99
From Kimberlina, California 
Fourteen hours to Marion, Virginia 
Chasing a fire on the horizon that burns above my home 
Watching dawn ignite around me, I'm alive in the gloam 
I would live my life between the sugar and the pine 
If I could drive forever down Highway 99
From Kimberlina, California 
Fourteen hours to same old Arizona 
Kimberlina I wish that I'd not left her so quickly 
No one to hear me singing, 
No one to tell me where to turn
No one to see me crying
Here I can just let it burn 
From Kimberlina, California 
Fourteen hours to same old Arizona 
Kimberlina I wish that I'd not left her so quickly 
I wish that I was better, I wish she wasn't scared 
I wish that this was easier, I wish I was prepared 
For Kimberlina . . .
