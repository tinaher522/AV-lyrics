<song artist="Obadiah_Parker" title="Fall-Back">
I swear that I've been here before on this same couch with this 
Same disregard 
Baby, this is where darkness lives and it'll catch you off your guard 
I hope you can believe there's more to me than what you see 
And that we have no business here even though you don't agree 
Until we fall back onto the Great I Am 
We'll use up all we got, our love we will exhaust 
Until we learn to trust in the God of Abraham 
And give up what we got, all will be lost 
Something here is wrong, I can hear it in your voice 
But crying at home by yourself is your method of choice 
Over the phone, just a couple miles away, is right where I belong 
Do you think that you were happier before I came along? 
Until we fall back onto the Great I Am 
We'll use up all we got, our love we will exhaust 
Until we learn to trust in the God of Abraham 
And give up what we got, all will be lost 
I want to love you well I want to do this right 
During the day it's so easy but it gets hard at night 
I hope you can believe that I can't go on at this rate 
Something's gotta change, I just hope it's not too late 
Until we fall back onto the Great I Am 
We'll burn up all we got, our love we will exhaust 
Until we learn to trust in the God of Abraham 
And give up what we got, all will be lost 
What'cha gonna do with your love 
What'cha gonna let go of 
It's time to make your choice right now 
What'cha gonna do about this 
You know it's never just one kiss 
Don't lie to me, don't lie to yourself 
I feel like everything is wrong
