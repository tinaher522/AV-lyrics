Lord, I've been waiting, and waiting I am still 
Long has it been since my cup you've filled 
I've lost that flavor, I need to salten it up 
So won't you fill me, as I lift you up? 
I feel you moving, your spirit inside me 
Oh Lord, your glory is all I want to see 
And as you fill me and overfloweth my cup 
I just can't help it, I need to lift you up 
I need to I need to lift my hands, I need to stomp my feet 
I need to sing out with all that I have in me
I need to lift my hands, I need to stomp my feet
I need to sing out with all that I have in me
Because you're rescuing me
Because you've set me free
I feel you moving, your spirit inside me 
Oh Lord, your glory is all I want to see 
And as you fill me and overfloweth my cup 
I just can't help it, I need to lift you up 
I need to I need to lift my hands, I need to stomp my feet 
I need to sing out with all that I have in me
I need to lift my hands, I need to stomp my feet
I need to sing out with all that I have in me
Because you're rescuing me
Because you've set me free 
Someday the Lord will come for now I'm here to stay
Someday the Lord will come for now I'm here to stay
So I will stand right here 
And I will lift my voice in this place
So I will stand right here 
And I will lift my voice in this place
I need to lift my hands, I need to stomp my feet
I need to sing out with all that I have in me
I need to lift my hands, I need to stomp my feet
I need to sing out with all that I have in me
All that I have in me
Is this burnt offering
