<song artist="Obadiah_Parker" title="Hey_Ya">
My baby don't mess around
Because she loves me so
And this I know for sure
But does she really wanna
But can't stand to see me
Walk out the door
I can't stand to fight the feeling
Because the thought alone is killing me right now
Thank god for mom and dad
For sticking two together
'Cause we don't know how
Hey Ya
Hey Ya
Hey Ya
Hey Ya
You think you've got it
Oh, you think you've got it
But got it just don't get it
Till' there's nothing at all
We get together
Oh, we get together
But separate's always better
When there's feelings involved
If what they say is "Nothing is forever"
Then what makes, then what makes
Then what makes love the exception?
So why you, why you
Why you, why you, why you
Are we so in denial
When we know we're not happy here
Hey Ya
Hey Ya
Hey Ya
Hey Ya
Hey Ya
Hey Ya
Yo, alright now fellas
Now what's cooler than being cool?
I can't hear you
I say what's cooler than being cool?
And alright and alright
Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright, alright
Alright now ladies
We gonna break this thing down in just a few seconds here
Now don't have me break it down for nothing
I wanna see y'all on y'alls baddest behavior
I say lend me some sugar
I am your neighbor
Shake it, shake, shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake it, shake, shake it
Shake it, shake, shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake it, shake, shake it
Shake it like a Polaroid picture
Shake it, shake, shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake it, shake, shake it
Shake it, shake, shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake it, shake, shake it
Shake it like a Polaroid picture
Shake it, shake, shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake it, shake, shake it
Shake it, shake, shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake it, shake, shake it
Shake it like a Polaroid picture
Shake it, shake, shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake it, shake, shake it
Shake it, shake, shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake it, shake, shake it
And, hey Ya
Hey Ya
Hey Ya
Hey Ya
Hey Ya
Hey Ya
Hey Ya
Hey Ya
