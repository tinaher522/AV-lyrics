<song artist="Obadiah_Parker" title="Suicide_Note">
If I could tell you something just before you did it
I think I would tell you, Octavia
Don't leave us
At least not yet
If I had my chance to convince you
I think that I would, I think that I would tell you, Octavia
I don't know what's going on
But I think I can help you
But me you did not call on that night
To say you were leaving
I would have promised you if I could then I would
Spend every night and day with you
I really would
If it'd mean that you won't be leaving
And I would have told you stories just to keep you awake
If you felt like you were getting tired of living
Just to hold on
Before you go away sleeping
Oh, but me you did not call
To me you did not write
The letter you left behind, on that night
To say you were leaving
I know that I barely know you
And the time that we've spent hasn't been very long,
But Octavia, I would have prayed
That you'd believe me when I'd say
I love you
