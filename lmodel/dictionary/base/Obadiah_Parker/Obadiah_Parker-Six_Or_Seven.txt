Six or Seven
Muted and gray are all the words that you say 
I'm not listening anymore anyway 
Perfectly shaded everything seemed at first 
But that was just well rehearsed 
"This will be the last time" I say 
But always, it's all the same 
Six or seven times before today 
Things have ended up in the same way 
Chorus:
But the lightness in your tone 
And the brightness of your eyes 
Keep me coming back for another time 
It's the flashing of your love 
And it's the breaking of your heart 
That make me hope that this could be the start 
Of something good 
Surrounded by the things that have sucked you dry 
It won't be long now before you die 
Blinded by a fear of pain and loneliness 
You crawl back into the arms of such a mess 
Come on girl get outside of your head 
Forget about all the dirty things that he's said 
Six or seven times you've disappeared 
This time was the last time I fear 
Chorus:
But the lightness in your tone 
And the brightness of your eyes 
Keep me coming back for another time 
It's the flashing of your love 
And it's the breaking of your heart 
That make me hope that this could be the start 
Of something good 
You wish everything could be the same 
But I just can't quite shake the pain 
All these words and all these apologies 
Don't make up for all the things that I've seen 
I've been busted up from your hands 
And I know that you don't understand 
Six or seven times we've made it right 
But I think that I should cut it off tonight 
Chorus:
But the lightness in your tone 
And the brightness of your eyes 
Keep me coming back for another time 
It's the flashing of your love 
And it's the breaking of your heart 
That make me hope that this could be the start 
Of something good   
Run away, run away, you gotta get away, get away 
Before it's too late 
I wanna help you 
Get away, get away you gotta run away, run away 
Before it's too late 
Six or seven years up to today 
Don't throw it all away
