<song artist="Obadiah_Parker" title="So_Hard_To_Find">
Was this all a mistake? 
Was this all a lie? 
Just a massive undertaking to pacify? 
Was this given to me? 
Or did I take it away? 
Did I ever even choose to live this way? 
How do I know 
What's the bottom line 
When the truth can be sometimes so hard to find? 
Can I justify 
The words that I say? 
Would I want to if I could, could I do it if I would? 
This is more than a stance 
This is more than me opinionating 
This is more than chance 
This is more than a passing feeling that I've had 
And even though I can't know for sure 
There's something burning deep inside 
That I'm not ready to ignore 
And so 
I'll wait for you 
Cause you say you'll be around 
And I'll look for you 
Cause you promise to come down 
And I'll listen hard 
For a still small sound 
I'll search for you 
Cause you promise to be found 
Was this all a mistake? 
Did I make a wrong choice? 
Did I listen inside my heart for the right voice? 
Did I feel anything? 
Or was it all in my head? 
A dream to make life better until I'm dead? 
This is more than a stance 
This is more than me opinionating 
This is more than chance 
This is more than a passing feeling that I've had 
And even though I can't know for sure 
There's something burning deep inside 
That I'm not ready to ignore 
And so 
I'll wait for you 
Cause you say you'll be around 
And I'll look for you 
Cause you promise to come down 
And I'll listen hard 
For a still small sound 
I'll search for you 
Cause you promise to be found 
Amazing grace how sweet the sound 
That saved a wretch like me 
I once was lost but now am found 
Was blind but now I see 
I remember the day in the park under the tree 
When grace was given to me
