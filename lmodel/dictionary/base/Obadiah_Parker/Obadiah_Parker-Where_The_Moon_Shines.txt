<song artist="Obadiah_Parker" title="Where_The_Moon_Shines">
Where the moon shines 
The streets are damp and cold 
Where the moon shines 
Dreams are bought and sold 
Under the blue light's flood 
Secrets are never told 
Where the moon shines 
Is where the darkness lives 
Where the moon shines 
On all the day forbids 
The mysteries of the shadows 
No one remembers to forgive 
Someday soon I know I'm gonna leave here 
Leave my life to die
Someday I'll be walking
In the sweet by and by
Where the moon shines 
So far away from home 
Where the moon shines 
Everyone is alone 
The boulevards and avenues 
Are no place to atone 
Someday soon I know I'm gonna go there 
Leave my life to die
Someday I'll be walking
In the sweet by and by
