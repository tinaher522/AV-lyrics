<song artist="Jamie_Lawson" title="Some_Ships">
Some say the day is done just as the sun goes down
Some say it's just begun just as the moon gets found
And some ships will sail between and somewhere on the bow
I know your love is gone, it's all that matters now
Some say the moon's a fool, some say it just won't lie
Some say that life is cruel yet others pass it by
Some ships just sail between, some ships just cant be found
I know your love is gone, it's all that matters now
Time takes itself too long for some wounds to ever heal
Some ships will sail between these dreams and what is real
But only time will tell just is what it is we held
I think about you now, i wonder where you're gone
Some say you're heaven bound but you lived there all along
Some ship has sailed between your heart and mine somehow
I know that life goes on, i guess, it's all that matters now.
