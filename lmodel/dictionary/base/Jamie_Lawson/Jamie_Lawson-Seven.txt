<song artist="Jamie_Lawson" title="Seven">
Given the chances missed it.
Given that fate must be twisted.
This isn't easy.
Given the answers are all true,
Given the way that he hurt you.
This isn't easy at all.
Seven – I swear to God
Seven – You'll get all that you want
Seven – Now take the chance on you
Given the way that you had to cope.
Given that you walked the tightrope
When there was no one to catch you if you fell.
Given that I know you'll come through.
Given your hearts good and its true
He will be heading straight to Hell.
Seven – He will go to Hell
Seven – The devil himself
Seven – Collects all the bones
As you dance on his grave for the hurt that he gave
You will dance on his grave
Singing, "UP YOURS!"
Singing, "UP YOURS!"
Seven – He will go to Hell
Seven – The devil himself
Seven – Collects all the bones
As you dance on his grave for the hurt that he gave
Seven – I swear to God
Seven – You'll get all that you want
Seven – now take the chance 'cause you didn't let him win,
You didn't let him win.
No you never let him win.
Given that you walked the tightrope.
Given the way that you have coped and come through
To be beautiful and true;
You are beautiful and true.
