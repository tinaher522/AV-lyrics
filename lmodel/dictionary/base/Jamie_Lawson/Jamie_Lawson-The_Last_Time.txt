<song artist="Jamie_Lawson" title="The_Last_Time">
If it's the last thing that you do
If it's the last time we pull through
And the last line back to you
Can I take it?
If it's the last time that you read
If it's the last time we can't see
Can you do one last thing for me
Before you break iiiiit
Hold on before it's all gone
It seems we're never gonna make this right
If we're goin' nowhere
Can we stay there
And believe in this for one more night
It's not the way we's planned this
Hard to understand it
We almost fell in love so fast
If this is the last time
Let the last time last
And we can leave all this behind
We could say we found what we can't find
It won't be the last time that we cry
If we fake iiiiiiit iiit
So hold on before it's all gone
It seems we're never gonna make this right
If we're goin' nowhere
Can we stay there
And belive in this for one more night
It's hard to understand it
It's not the way we planned it
We almost fell in love so fast
If this is the last time
Let the last time last
Oh oh
What don't you understand
Hold on before it's all gone
And let the colour bleed until we're gone
If we're goin' nowhere
We should stay there
You never know what we might find
And its hard to understand
And its not the way we've planned
And its all fallin' apart so fast
If this is the last time
Let the last time last
Oh
If this is the last time
Let the last time last
Let this be the last time that you say
This is the last time if you stay
