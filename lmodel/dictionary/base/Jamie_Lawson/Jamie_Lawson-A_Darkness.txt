<song artist="Jamie_Lawson" title="A_Darkness">
It was only a smile but my heart it went wild
And I wasn't expecting that
Just a delicate kiss, anyone could've missed
I wasn't expecting that
Did I misread the sign? Your hand slipped into mine
I wasn't expecting that
You spent the night in my bed, you woke up and you said
"Well, I wasn't expecting that"
I thought love wasn't meant to last,
I thought you were just passing through
If I ever get the nerve to ask
What did I get right to deserve somebody like you?
I wasn't expecting that
It was only a word, it was almost mis-heard
'Cause I wasn't expecting that
But it came without fear, a month turned into a year
And I wasn't expecting that
I thought love wasn't meant to last,
I thought you were just passing through
If I ever get the nerve to ask
What did I get right to deserve somebody like you?
I wasn't expecting that
Isn't it strange how a life can be changed
In the flicker of the sweetest smile
We were married in spring
You know I wouldn't change a thing
Without an innocent kiss, what a life I'd have missed,
If you'd not took a chance on a little romance
When I wasn't expecting that
Time doesn't take long, three kids up and gone
And I wasn't expecting that
And when the nurses they came, said its come back again
I wasn't expecting that
Then you closed your eyes, took my heart by surprise
And I wasn't expecting that!
