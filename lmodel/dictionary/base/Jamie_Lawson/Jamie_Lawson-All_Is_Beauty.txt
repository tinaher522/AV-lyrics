<song artist="Jamie_Lawson" title="All_Is_Beauty">
Turns I don't know the time
I was thinking we were alright
Star shine with particular style
Just enough to see how you smile
All is beauty
All is beauty
All is beauty for miles
And miles
And miles now
Love is a delicate rhyme
You pull me in and said now you're mine
You kissed me in the rain and I said
Sometimes I don't know how to hike
From all this beauty
All this beauty
All this beauty inside
Inside
Inside now
Feels like I'll burst and explode any minute now
For our heart can hold what is in it now
The mess that we make
It will be glorious
The mess that we make
Just the two of us
All is beauty
All is beauty
All is beauty in trust
We drunk enough to drown a small town
I woke to see you as you came round
Smiling like you just doesn't care
I kissed you so to prove that you were there
All is beauty
All is beauty
All is beauty everywhere
