<song artist="Jamie_Lawson" title="Real_Thing">
Call me if you need someone to hold you close
You know I should be the one to love you most
And my heart is on its way again
And I don't know what to say again
Is it always been this way? I don't know
I know that someone else is on your house
But I couldn't change the way I feel about you at all
Change the way I felt
And my heart is on its way again
And I don't know what to say again
Is it always been this way? I don't know
Is this the real thing?
This makes my heart sing love
Is this the real thing?
'Cause I've called it love
I've called it love
I've called it love
I've called it love
Would you call it love?
Would you call it love?
Would you call it love?
If your heart is on its way again
You don't know what to say again
Is it always been this way? I guess so
My heart is on its way again
And I don't know what to say again
Will it always be this way?
This is the real thing
'Cause this makes my heart sing love
This is the real thing
This makes my heart sing about love
And I call this the real thing
And I call this the real thing
And I hope that you call me
I hope that you call me
This is the real thing
