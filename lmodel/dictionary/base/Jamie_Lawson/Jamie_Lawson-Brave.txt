<song artist="Jamie_Lawson" title="Brave">
Jesus, do I miss her.
If she were mine to miss, Jesus, would I miss her more?
Jesus, have you seen her, everlasting like a sundown?
Doesn't burn at all.
She is kindness to my skin, forgiveness through my sin.
She knows everyone I've been and has not loved them all.
She set my heart on fire.
She knows I am a lion.
Will it only burn for her?
Well I don't know.
Jesus, do I miss her.
If she were mine to miss, Jesus, would I miss her more?
Jesus, have you seen her, everlasting like a sundown.
Doesn't burn at all.
She is kindness to my skin, forgiveness through my sin.
She knows everyone I've been and has not loved them all.
She set my heart on fire.
She knows I am a lion.
Will it only burn for her?
Well I don't know.
She is burning for me now and I feel the sun on me shining down.
I know that I am awake.
And sometime soon I guess we'll crash.
We have love that wasn't meant to last, better to burn out and fade away.
Or maybe for once in my life, maybe for once in my life I'll be brave.
It's all I ever wanted.
Love can be held and I'm going to need your love.
I need your love.
I need your love to keep me warm.
Come on, keep me warm.
And hold on to me now, hold on.
Baby we can find a way to make this stay and keep it here.
