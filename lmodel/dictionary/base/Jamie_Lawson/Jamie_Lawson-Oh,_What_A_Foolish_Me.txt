<song artist="Jamie_Lawson" title="Oh,_What_A_Foolish_Me">
Everthing is bound to fade(?) if you give it time
Everything will fade accordingly
I thought you and I were an exception to the rules
I thought you and I would always be;
 Oh, What a foolish me!
Every star will burn itself out in the end
Every shore line returns to the sea
I thought you and I were made to withstand any fate
I thought you and I would always be; 
Oh, What a foolish me!
What is it that I have not understood
What is it that I have failed to see
I can't believe its feelings like this would
Just let you slip away so easily
Oh but wasn't I the one that set you free
Oh, What a foolish me!
Everyone is bound to bleed a little bit
Everyone is bound to disagree
I thought you and I were an exception to the rules
I thought you and I would always be;
Oh, What a foolish me!
Oh, What a foolish me!
Oh, What a foolish me!
