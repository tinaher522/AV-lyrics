<song artist="Jamie_Lawson" title="Last_Night_Stars">
Last night stars are faded
There's only a bright blue sky
Covering us
Last night stars are faded
There's only a bright blue sky
To cover you now
If i knew the words
We could learn how to live
Without you
And what am i supposed to do
What am i supposed to do
Last night stars have faded
There's only a bright blue sky
To cover you now
Last night stars have faded
There's only a bright blue sky
To cover you now
If i knew the signs
We could tell how to live
Without you
And what am i supposed to do
What am I supposed to do
Living without you
Its complicated
Flames rise high
Its complicated
Burns into the sky
Is there somewhere to save this
