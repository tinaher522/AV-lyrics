<song artist="Jamie_Lawson" title="North_Shore">
I go down to the North Shore
Not far now from where you live
And I think about what it's all for
And how much more we had to give
And when you stole the keys to my car
And drove through the fields where we played
And how I would never had left you if you'd stayed
Waves break the end of an ocean
The moon determines how high the tide
Did I love you with too much devotion?
Did it hurt, the way you felt inside?
Or were we just too young to hold true
To these promises of love that we made
'cause I would never had left you if you'd stayed (oh no)
Hey, hey what can the matter be?
Here with us now
I guess it's too late to call you
And I hear that you've changed your name
I have a dream that we'd fall into
Where you and I are just the same, same
And I'll take you up on this all
Out under stars we both lay
And I swear i'll never leave you if you stay
And I swear i'll never leave you if you stay
Now, hold on now
If you stay
Come with me now, just come with me now
(Down where you are x7)
