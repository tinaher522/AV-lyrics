<song artist="Jamie_Lawson" title="This_Is_Love">
Well I can't hold on
But I won't let go
I am on your side
We're so far gone
And we can't turn round
I am on your side
Can I leave you alone so long?
I turn to find you gone
Your uninvited, unrequited love
Oh don't say it again
Say it again, say it again
Oh don't say it again
Say it again, don't say it again
If I sleep right here
For a hundred years
Will your kiss wake me up?
If my heart won't beat
'cause of love's retreat
Will your kiss wake me up?
'cause I left you alone so long
Turned and I found you gone
Your uninvited, unrequited love
And oh don't say it again
Say it again, say it again
Oh don't say it again
Say it again, say it again
Won't you say it again
Say it again, say it again
Won't you say it again
Say it again, say it again
Won't you say it again
Say it again, say it again
Won't you say it again
Say it again, say it again
Say it again
Say it again
Say it again
This is love
This is love
