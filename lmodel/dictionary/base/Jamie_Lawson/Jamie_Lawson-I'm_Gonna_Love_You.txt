<song artist="Jamie_Lawson" title="I'm_Gonna_Love_You">
From the way we often are
From my hotel to the bar
And the last time that we saw each other cry
From the last time when we cried
To the next when we decide
We should just let each other pass us by
But I'm gonna love you
Though I don't know how to
From the way we used to be
To the steakhouse, you and me
From the times that we have hurt each other trying
From the stars up in the sky
We should know now you and I
Just to leave this love alone
Oh watch it dying
I'm gonna love you
Though I don't know how to
And I'm gonna love you
Though I don't know how to
From the way we often were
And the healing of the hurt
And the time it takes to find the understanding
But it's how things often are
From that hotel to the bar
And the memories that I swore I'd take your hand in
I'm gonna love you
Though I don't know how to
No I'm gonna love you
Though I don't know how to
