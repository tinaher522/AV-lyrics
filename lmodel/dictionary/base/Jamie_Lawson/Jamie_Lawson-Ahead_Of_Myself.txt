<song artist="Jamie_Lawson" title="Ahead_Of_Myself">
Don't wanna get ahead of myself,
But isn't this grand?
Don't wanna make a fool of myself,
Is it already planned?
There you go making promises,
You're never gonna keep
Don't wanna get ahead of myself,
I'm already in too deep...
Don't wanna get ahead of myself,
But isn't this swell?
Don't wanna make a fool of myself,
Like a clown I just fell.
There you go making promises,
You really shouldn't say
Don't wanna get ahead of myself,
I think I just found the way...
If you dig a little deeper,
Way down into your soul,
You may find a way to sweep her off her feet,
Let the evening come and go...
Don't wanna get ahead of myself,
But isn't she fine?
Don't wanna make a fool of myself,
Like she's already mine.
There you go making promises,
You never should've thought
Don't wanna get ahead of myself,
I think that I've just been caught...
Oh, if you dig a little deeper,
Way, way, way, way down into your soul,
You may find a way to sweep her off her feet,
Oh let the evening come and go...
Didn't wanna get ahead of myself,
I think I just did.
Didn't wanna make a fool of myself,
Like a love-struck, idiot kid.
There I go making promises,
I never could've kept.
Didn't wanna get ahead of myselfâ€¦
And then I learned,
If you dig a little deeper,
Way, way, way, way down into your soul,
Oh, you may find,
Oh, you'll sweep her off her feet,
Let the evening, let the evening come and go...
If you dig a little deeper,
Way, way, way, way down into your soul,
Oh, you may find,
Oh, you'll sweep her off her feet,
Oh let the evening, let the evening come and go...
I get ahead of myself...
I get ahead of myself...
Oh, you may find,
I get ahead of myself...
