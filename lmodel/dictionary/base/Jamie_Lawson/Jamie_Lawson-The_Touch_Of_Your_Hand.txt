<song artist="Jamie_Lawson" title="The_Touch_Of_Your_Hand">
Well it bent and it bent til it finally broke
And you meant and you meant every word that you spoke
And you meant and you meant every word that you spoke
You were cruel, you were cruel but as I understand
I must travel through Hell for the touch of your hand
Well I lied and I lied til the truth it broke free
And you tried and you tried to get the better of me
Did it hurt? Did it hurt as the life that youd planned?
Crumpled and fell for the touch of my hand?
I will love you like no other
I will love you for my own
And I will never take another.
And we will never be alone.
I will swallow; I will swallow what there is of my pride
I will follow; I will follow to be by your side
And if still you dont love me, if youve tried but you cant
Ill have done all I could for the touch of your hand
So tomorrow, tomorrow with the dawn as it breaks
I have begged, stole and borrowed such wondrous mistakes
And I will swear on my life as I take the stand
I am guilty as sin for the touch of your hand
