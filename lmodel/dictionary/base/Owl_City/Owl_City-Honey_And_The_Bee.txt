<song artist="Owl_City" title="Honey_And_The_Bee">
Don't remind me
That some days I'm a windshield
And other days I'm just a lucky bug
As cold iron rails leave
Old mossy trails through the countryside
The crow and the bean field
Are my best friends but
Boy, I need a hug (boy, I need a hug)
'Cause my heart stops without you
There's something about you 
That makes me feel alive
If the green left the grass on the other side
I would make like a tree and leave
But if I reached for your hand, would your eyes get wide?
Who knew the other side could be so green?
Don't remind me
I'm a chickadee in love with the sky
But that's clearly not a lot to crow about
'Cause when the stars silhouette me
I'm scared they'll forget me
And flicker out
I chase honey but I haven't seen the hive
Yeah I didn't look, I didn't even try
But still my heart stops without you
'Cause there's something about you 
That makes me feel alive
If the green left the grass on the other side
I would make like a tree and leave
But if I reached for your hand, would your eyes get wide?
Who knew the other side could be so green?
We are honey and the bee
Backyard of butterflies surrounded me
I fell in love with you, like bees to honey
So let's up and leave the weeping to the willow tree
And pour our tears in the sea
I swear there's a lot of vegetables out there
That crop up for air
Yeah I never thought we were two peas in a pod
Until you suddenly bloomed, then I knew
That I'd always love you
(Oh, I'll always love you too)
If the green left the grass on the other side
I would make like a tree and leave
But if I reached for your hand, would your eyes get wide?
Who knew the other side could be so green?
If the green left the grass on the other side
I would make like a tree and leave
But if I reached for your hand, would your eyes get wide?
Who knew the other side could be so green?
And if I reached for your hand for the rest of my life
Who knew the other side could be so green?
