<song artist="Owl_City" title="Panda_Bear">
I'm moving to Tokyo
'Cause I'm tired of San Francisco
My contracts are finally void
And I am getting out
On houses and building tops
I swallow the beams and sun drops
If my echos could reach your ears
Then I could save my calls
What happens when I'm above
The east river when you are in love?
We're staring at all these lights
And I am going blind
Fill all of the Navy yards
With hard working security guards
'Cause the numbers are wearing off
My plastic access cards
How can I begin to say
I feel better off when we stayed
In Paris on winter nights
Beneath a snowy veil?
Content like a panda bear
Still breathing the fresh mountain air
I'll put on a diving tank
And sing when I inhale
