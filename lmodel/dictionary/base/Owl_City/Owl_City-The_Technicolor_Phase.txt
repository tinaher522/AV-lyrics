<song artist="Owl_City" title="The_Technicolor_Phase">
I am the red in the rose
The flowers on the blankets on your bedroom floor
And I am the gray in the ghost
That hides with your clothes
Behind your closet door
I am the green in the grass
That bends back from underneath your feet
And I am the blue in your back alley view
Where the horizon and the rooftops meet
If you cut me, I suppose I would bleed
The colors of the evening stars
You can go anywhere you wish
'Cause I'll be there, wherever you are
(Wherever you are)
I will always keep your gaze
When we are lost in the Technicolor phase
I am the black in the book
The letters on the pages that you memorize
And I am the orange in the overcast
A color that you visualize
I am the white in the walls
That soak up all the sound
When you cannot sleep
And I am the peach in the starfish on the beach
That wish the harbor wasn't quite so deep
If you cut me, I suppose I would bleed
The colors of the evening stars
(My darling)
You can go anywhere you wish
'Cause I'll be there, wherever you are
(My darling)
(Wherever you are)
