<song artist="Owl_City" title="Gold">
Stand on up and take a bow
There's something there and it’s showing
There's no need to look around
You're the best we've got going
Shout out to the dreams you'll chase
Shout out to the hearts you'll break
Nothing's gonna stop you know
I guess you better be going
Like never before
I'm keeping you near
Inside of my heart you're here
Go on, it's gotta be time
It's time to shine cause what you've got is
Go-ohoh-oh-ohoh-ohoh-old
I know you’re gold
Oh-ohoh-oh-ohoh-ohoh-oh
I know, I know
I don’t need the stars in the night
I've found my treasure
All I need is you by my side
So shine forever
Oh-ohoh-oh-ohoh-ohoh-oh
I know you’re gold
Oh-ohoh-oh-ohoh-ohoh-oh
I know you’re gold
It won’t take long to get when you feel like you're soaring
So ride it all and don’t forget you got to tell us your story
Shout out to the friends back home
Shout out to the hearts you have known
You gave them nothing but the best
Yeah and you can tell them your story
Like never before
I'm keeping you near
Inside of my heart you're here
Go on, it's gotta be time
It's time to shine cause what you've got is
Go-ohoh-oh-ohoh-ohoh-old
I know you’re gold
Oh-ohoh-oh-ohoh-ohoh-oh
I know, I know
I don’t need the stars in the night
I've found my treasure
All I need is you by my side
So shine forever
Oh-ohoh-oh-ohoh-ohoh-oh
I know you’re gold
Oh-ohoh-oh-ohoh-ohoh-oh
I know you’re gold
'Cause what you've got is
Go-ohoh-oh-ohoh-ohoh-old
I know you’re gold
Oh-ohoh-oh-ohoh-ohoh-oh
I know, I know
I don’t need the stars in the night
I've found my treasure
All I need is you by my side
So shine forever
Oh-ohoh-oh-ohoh-ohoh-oh
I know you’re gold
Oh-ohoh-oh-ohoh-ohoh-oh
I know you’re gold
You're gold
You're gold
