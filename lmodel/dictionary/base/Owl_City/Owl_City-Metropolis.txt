<song artist="Owl_City" title="Metropolis">
Oh oh, I can't even take it in
Oh oh, I can't even take it in
Oh oh, I left my heart in Metropolis
So far apart, I checked that the coast was clear
I feel like a postcard; I wish you were here
Subway through the dark, carriage through the park
Taxi down the street, get out and use my feet
Don't matter much to me what I do
as long as I'm coming home to you
Oh oh oh, as far as I can see
You're the only one, the only one who can get to me
Like a hijacked plane, like a runaway train
Or a speeding bullet
There's no stopping this
I left my heart in Metropolis
A thousand miles feels like a million years
Like hundreds of postcards that say I wish you were here
Airplane through the sky, greyhound racing by
Sailboat on the sea
Don't matter much to me what it is that I do
as long as I'm coming back to you
Oh oh oh, as far as I can see
You're the only one, the only one who can get to me
Like a hijacked plane, or a runaway train
Or a speeding bullet
There's no stopping this
I left my heart in Metropolis
Oh oh, I can't even take it in
Oh oh, I left my heart in Metropolis
