<song artist="Owl_City" title="Bombshell_Blonde">
That blonde, she's a bomb, she's an atom bomb
Rigged up and ready to drop
The bad news, I'm a fuse and I've met my match
So stand back, it's about to go off
That vixen, she's a master of disguise!
I see danger when I look in her eyes
She's so foxy! She could lead to my demise
So I'm running 'cause I've ran out of time
She's a bombshell blonde, wired up to detonate
I'm James Bond, live to die another day
Bombshell blonde, high explosive dynamite
She's all I want, so I, I'm on a mission tonight
(I, I'm on a mission tonight)
Her love is a drug mixed with ecstasy
And her charm is spiked with a spell
A hot mess in a dress gets the best of me
She's ice cold, but she's making me melt

That vixen, she's a master of disguise!
I see danger when I look in her eyes
She's so foxy! She could lead to my demise
So I'm running 'cause I've ran out of time
She's a bombshell blonde, wired up to detonate
I'm James Bond, live to die another day
Bombshell blonde, high explosive dynamite
She's all I want, so I, I'm on a mission tonight

That vixen, she's a master of disguise!
I see danger when I look in her eyes
She's so foxy! She could lead to my demise
So I'm running 'cause I've ran out of time
She's a bombshell blonde, wired up to detonate
I'm James Bond, live to die another day
Bombshell blonde, high explosive dynamite
She's all I want, so I, I'm on a mission tonight

That vixen, she's a master of disguise!
I see danger when I look in her eyes
She's so foxy! She could lead to my demise
So I'm running 'cause I've run out of time
She's a bombshell blonde, wired up to detonate
I'm James Bond, live to die another day
Bombshell blonde, high explosive dynamite
She's all I want, so I, I'm on a mission tonight
(I, I'm on a mission tonight)
