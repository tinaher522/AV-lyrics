<song artist="Owl_City" title="West_Coast_Friendship">
Are you out there where the rainy days 
Begin to feel rather sad
And the walls are closing in 
Like the darkness around me
It's so hard to look away
when the daylight doesn't ever stay
Above this dull apartment view
Oh I will surround you
It's quite clear that I'm stuck here
So I'll devise a plan
And cut out a door
In my new living room floor
The porch light is so bright
That I will quickly sneak down
The dark metal shape
Of the rusty fire escape
I bought a one way ticket
'Cause I knew I'd never see the ground
Unless I was aboard a jet plane
And we were going down
When I wiped the tears from my eyes
The warm water took me by surprise
And I woke up beside the ocean
I realized: I must be in California
Aloha my happy west coast friend
Do you feel alive
When the breaking waves arrive
And wash all around you
The beach homes and ocean side
Are quite well know by the evening tide
And we can sleep where we reside
With redwoods around us
The blue air is up there
And could I bring it down
I'd bottle it up and save it 
For a sweet summer night
I bought a one way ticket
'Cause I knew I'd never see the ground
Unless I was aboard a jet plane
And we were going down
When I wiped the tears from my eyes
The warm water took me by surprise
And I woke up beside the ocean
I realized: I must be in California
Am I awake or is this just a dream?
The new year is out here
And I will make a lovely 
List of your charms
so I'll never feel alone in your arms
I must be in California
