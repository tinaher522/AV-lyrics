<song artist="Owl_City" title="Can't_Live_Without_You">
All the thoughts in my head spinning 'round like a hurricane
And life leaves me so confused
When I trip and I fall I collapse like a tidal wave
So I'm crying out to you
You reach down out of nowhere
And pick my heart up off the floor
You put my life back together
And I'm not broken anymore
You're my only wish for a dream come true
And it goes like this: Will you come to my rescue?
You're the only hope that I'm clinging to
And I hope you know I can't live without you
(I can't live without you
I just can't live without you)
When I'm hit like a hook to the jaw in a tidal fight
I'm down and I'm knocked out cold, you know
And with my heart broke apart like a wreck in a shallow tide
Yeah I've never felt this low
You reach down out of nowhere
And pick my heart up off the floor
You put my life back together
And I'm not broken anymore
(This is all I know)
You're my only wish for a dream come true
And it goes like this: Will you come to my rescue?
You're the only hope that I'm clinging to
And I hope you know I can't live without you
(I can't live without you
I just can't live without you)
You're my only wish for a dream come true
And it goes like this: Will you come to my rescue?
You're the only hope that I'm clinging to
And I hope you know I can't live without you
You're my only wish for a dream come true
And it goes like this: Will you come to my rescue?
You're the only hope that I'm clinging to
And I hope you know I can't live without you
