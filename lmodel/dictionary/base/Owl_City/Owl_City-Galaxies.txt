<song artist="Owl_City" title="Galaxies">
Call back the cap-com, tick off the time-bomb
Let felicity fly
Armor the airlock, blanket the bedrock
And kiss the planet goodbye
Dear God, I was terribly lost
When the galaxies crossed
And the sun went dark
But dear God, you're the only North Star
I would follow this far
Da da da da da da da da da da da
Da da da da da da da
(Through the galaxy)
Da da da da da da da da da
Da da da da da da da
Da da da da
(Through the galaxy, through the galaxy)
Fight back the flight deck, bring on the breakneck
Cue the solar eclipse (sun went dark)
Summit the sunset, dubtail the dragnet
And blow your backbone to bits
Dear God, I was terribly lost
When the galaxies crossed
And the sun went dark (went dark)
But dear God, you're the only North Star
I would follow this far
Oh telescope, keep an eye on my only hope
Lest I blink and get swept off the narrow road
Hercules, you've got nothing to say to me
'Cause you're not the blinding light that I need
For He is the saving grace of the galaxies
He is the saving grace of the galaxies
Dear God, I was terribly lost
When the galaxies crossed
And the sun went dark (went dark)
But dear God, you're the only North Star
I would follow this far
(I would follow this far)
Through the galaxy
Through the galaxy
Da da da da da da da da da
Da da da da da da da
Da da da da
