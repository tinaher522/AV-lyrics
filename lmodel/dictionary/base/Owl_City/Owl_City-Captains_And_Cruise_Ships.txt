<song artist="Owl_City" title="Captains_And_Cruise_Ships">
I am stuck in L.A.
Through the week and can't get away
And you're alone on the pier
In West Palm Beach on your holiday.
Stormy nights re-awake
The stomachache that I've acquired
From feeling down; things look grim
And I'm so sick of being tired.
Apartment lights go dark
And it's depressing, but what can I do?
The midnight streets feel dead
When I am so used to driving with you.
Brighter lights fill the night
And bluer skies reflect in your eyes
As I inspect and analyze
All of these dreams I don't recognize.
If you're still up when the ships
In the port prepare to set sail,
Comb the beach and put those blue 
Flowers up in your ponytail
Inside my head, your voice
Is still resounding, but what can I do?
The empty rooms feel cold 
When I am so used to being with you.
Count the stars, watch the waves
Absorb the summer sun and think of me
When you explore hidden coves
And tiny island chains throughout the sea.
Can you still hear my voice
When I'm outside from over the phone?
For what it's worth, darling dear,
I wish you were here, 'cause I feel alone.
When you were home, we'd sing,
But since you've left, I don't hear anything.
And though I feel so sad,
I can't believe things are really that bad.
Old captains and brand new cruise ships
Sailing over the briny sea.
When I crash my beloved desk job
And swim through the debris,
I'll cut loose and leave this madhouse,
Bound for the Atlantic blue.
I'll stroll down your tree-lined driveway
And sail the ocean with you.
