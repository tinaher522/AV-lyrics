<song artist="Owl_City" title="I'll_Meet_You_There">
If we could sit together a moment
And talk forever just to pass the time
I would smile as the shivers and chills
Run down my spine
When your eyes are locked on mine
Oh, we'll fill the metro skies with country air
And when you close your tired eyes I'll meet you there
(I'll meet you there)
Deep inside of you
There's a ruby glow
And it gets brighter
Than you and I will ever know
There's a rushing sound
That surrounds us
When we walk alone
And its everything we've never known
Wander down the street
And I will be the pavement
beneath your feet
If we could just be immobile for some time
And finally figure out the way we feel
About the missing puzzle pieces
And cloudy question marks
That still look a bit surreal
Oh I tend to disappear here and there
So concentrate and you'll feel me everywhere
And we'll fill the metro skies with country air
If you're lost when you close your eyes I'll meet you there
I'll meet you there
You could be anywhere
(I'll meet you there)
Open your eyes and see
Everything you can be
[...]
