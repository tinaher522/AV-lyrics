<song artist="Owl_City" title="The_Tip_Of_The_Iceberg">
Welcome back winter once again
And put on your warm fuzzy sweater 'cause you'll feel much better when
The snowflakes fall gently to the ground
The temperature drops and your shivers freeze all the rivers around
But I keep you warm
If speed's a pro, inertia must be a con
'Cause the cold wind blows at precise rates when I've got my ice skates on
If the roads were paved with ice that wouldn't thaw or crack
I could skate from Maine to Nebraska then on to Alaska and back
'Cause you keep me warm
Peer over the edge, can you see me?
Rivulets flow from your eyes
Paint runs from your mouth like a waterfall
And your lungs crystallize
I'll travel the subzero tundra
I'll brave glaciers and frozen lakes
And that's just the tip of the iceberg
I'll do whatever it takes to change
Farewell powdery paradise
We'd rather skate on the thinnest ice
Fingers failed us before they froze
And frostbite bit down on all our toes
Snowdrifts build up and enfold us
As we wait out this winter storm
So we snuggle close in the darkness
And keep each other so warm
