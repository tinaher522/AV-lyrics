<song artist="Owl_City" title="Sunburn">
So there we were, back home from somewhere inside my head
Oh, bravely I fought off the monsters beneath her bed
Pillars of postwar books supported my frame of mind
While she memorized the pages that I tried to not hide behind
She took my hand in hers and whispered her love for me
The lantern died that night, but we didn't need to see
Implying that she's the bee's knees and I am the cat's meow
It's funny how she recalls what I can't remember now
But when her smile came back and I didn't feel half as horrible
She gave me a heart attack just because she looked so adorable
We both put our sunblock on
Laid on the beach and vowed that we'd live and we'd learn
Yeah, but she got a tan, and I got a sunburn
I got a sunburn
So there we were out there, unaware of where we'd been
We kicked off our flip-flops and swung from the rooftops again
It's awkward, but I'll confess she's all I can think about
And it's funny how I recall what she can't remember now
But when her smile came back and I didn't feel half as horrible
She gave me a heart attack just because she looked so adorable
We both put our sunblock on
Laid on the beach and vowed that we'd live and we'd learn
Yeah, but she got a tan, and I got a sunburn
Oh, afterglow, look out below, we left a trail of dust behind
As we parted ways, she held my gaze and left an imprint on my mind
I tried not to cry as we said goodbye and hung the clouds above my town
But I shed a tear when she disappeared, 'cause now I'm a stranger on the ground
When her smile came back and I didn't feel half as horrible
She gave me a heart attack
We both put our sunblock on
Laid on the beach and vowed that we'd live and we'd learn
But she got a tan, and I got a sunburn
She got a tan, and I got a sunburn
Yeah, but she got a tan, and I got a sunburn
