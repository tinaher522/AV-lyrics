<song artist="Owl_City" title="You're_Not_Alone">
Some days i barely hold on when life drags me down
I wanna let go
But when my Spirit is weak, You come to my aid 
And strengthen my soul 
I'm lost without You, I'll never doubt You 
You're grace is beyond compare
And though when it rains it pours, You know all i have is Yours
You smile when You hear my prayer 
You rescued and i believe that God is love and He is all i need
From this day forth for all Eternity 
I'll never wander on my own for i am Yours until You call me home 
I close my eyes and i can hear You say: 
You're not alone, oh oh oh
You're not alone, oh oh oh
Some days i just can't go on, i stumble and fall
And i hang my head
But You reach out for my hand and You lift me up
Again and again, oh yes
I'm lost without You, I'll never doubt You 
You're grace is beyond compare
And though when it rains it pours, You know all i have is Yours
You smile when You hear my prayer 
You rescued and i believe that God is love and He is all i need
From this day forth for all Eternity 
I'll never wander on my own for i am Yours until You call me home 
I close my eyes and i can hear You say: 
You're not alone, oh oh oh
You're not alone, oh oh oh
In the face of my depravity
For God so loved the world He taught for me
My fire burns til He returns and takes me home beyond the galaxy
You rescued and i believe that God is love and He is all i need
From this day forth for all Eternity (All Eternity)
I'll never wander on my own for i am Yours until You call me home 
I close my eyes and i can hear You say: 
You're not alone, oh oh oh
You're not alone, oh oh oh
You're not, you're not alone
You're never alone
