<song artist="Owl_City" title="Sky_Diver">
I stood up and took a breath
And threw open the bay doors
Below the clouds I saw the coast
And beautiful Hawaii
Leaning back the pilot smiled
And shouted have a good trip
I signed off and closed my eyes
Then I was falling through the sky
Leaning back the pilot smiled
And shouted have a good trip
I signed off and closed my eyes
then I was falling through the sky
