<song artist="Owl_City" title="Cave_In">
Please take a long hard look through your textbook 
'Cause I'm history
When I strap my helmet on, I'll be long gone
'Cause I've been dying to leave
Yeah, I'll ride the range and hide all my loose change
In my bedroll
'Cause riding a dirt bike down a turnpike
Always takes its toll on me
I've had just about enough of, quote, "diamonds in the rough"
Because my backbone is paper thin
Get me out of this cavern or I'll cave in
If the bombs go off the sun will still be shining
Because I've heard it said that every mushroom cloud has a silver lining
Though I'm always undermining too deep to know
Swallow a drop of gravel and blacktop
'Cause the road tastes like wintergreen
The wind and the rain smell of oil and octane
Mixed with stale gasoline
I'll soak up the sound trying to sleep on the wet ground
I'll get ten minutes give or take
'Cause I just don't foresee myself getting drowsy
When cold integrity keeps me wide awake
Get me out of this cavern or I'll cave in
Get me out of this cavern or I'll cave in
I'll keep my helmet on just in case my head caves in
'Cause if my thoughts collapse or mind framework snaps
It will make a mess like you wouldn't believe
Tie my handle bars to the stars so I stay on track
And if my intentions stray I'll wrench them away
Then I'll take my leave and I won't even look back
I won't even look back
