<song artist="Owl_City" title="Dear_Vienna">
I regarded the world as such a sad sight
Until I viewed it in black and white
Then I reviewed every frame and basic shape
And sealed the exits with caution tape
Don't refocus your eyes in the darkness
And don't remember this place unless
I describe all the things that you cannot see
And we'll unravel the mystery
Farewell, all my friends 
In textbooks, I'm going home
'Cause my blood cells cannot depend 
On the weather in photographs
There's a light show out my window 
Somewhere way up there
Dear Vienna, are you singing?
Dear Vienna, are you swinging?
Dear Vienna, we were happy like the shades of May
When we got carried away
I regarded the world as such a sad sight
Until I viewed it in black and white
Then I reviewed every frame and basic shape
And sealed the exits with caution tape
Don't refocus your eyes in the darkness
And don't remember this place unless
I describe all the things that you cannot see
And we'll unravel the mystery
I was so far out of place
Watching those stars in outer space
'Cause I am so far from where you are
There's a light show out my window 
Somewhere way up there
Dear Vienna, are you singing?
Dear Vienna, are you swinging?
Dear Vienna, we were happy like the shades of May
When we got carried away
