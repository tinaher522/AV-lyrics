<song artist="Owl_City" title="Air_Traffic">
The bird is here and we are off
To wherever those wings take us
The atmosphere is crawling with airlines that
Wind through the clouds and look down on the crowds
Relax your back and let the noise
Sing you to sleep in my arms
If you awake before we arrive 
I will carry you down and I wont make a sound
The scent is strong as we move on
And breathe in the pristine crime scene
The false veneer is old like a substitute 
Volunteer from, oh, some other year
I'm just a shell as far as I can tell
So I paint my eyes a light green
The silver beams are twirling and swirling
Throughout your dreams like air traffic streams
