<song artist="Owl_City" title="Peppermint_Winter">
There's the snow
Look out below
And bundle up
Cause here it comes
Run outside
So starry eyed
A snowball fight breaks out
And winter has finally begun
I twirl through the driveway
With angelic grace
Till I slip on the sidewalk
And fall on my face
This peppermint winter is so sugar sweet
I don't need a taste to believe
What's December without Christmas Eve?
Hop in the sleigh
And we'll glide away
In to the night
And we'll sip on moonlight
Runny nose
My frosty toes
Are gettin' cold but I feel alive
So I smile wide
The snowflakes start falling
And I start to float
Till my mean older brother
Stuffs snow down my coat
This peppermint winter is so sugar sweet
I don't need a taste to believe
What's December without Christmas Eve?
All this holiday cheer
Heaven knows where it goes
But it returns every year
And though this winter does nothing but storm
The joy in my heart will blaze and it's keeping me warm
It's keeping me warm
It's keeping me warm
I rip off the wrapping
And tear through the box
Till I end up with
45 new pairs of socks
This peppermint winter is so sugar sweet
I don't need a taste to believe
What's December without Christmas Eve?
