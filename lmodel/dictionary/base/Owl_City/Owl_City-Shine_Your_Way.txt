Adam Young
Just before the dawn,
When the light's still gone,
Shine, shine your way,
And you may not know, where to go,
To shine, shine your way
Open road but it's still dark,
Build a fire from a spark,
And shine, shine your way,
Feed the feeling in your heart,
Don't conceal it then you'll start,
To find, find your way
Yuna
No one can stop when has begun,
You must believe when I say
Both
All of your tears will dry faster in the sun,
Yuna
Starting today,
Both
Shine, shine, shine,
Shine your way
Yuna
There's an open sky,
And a reason why,
You shine, shine your way,
There's so much to learn,
And now it's your turn,
To shine, shine your way
Both
There's a feeling deep inside,
You can let it be your guide,
To find, find your way,
And there's no time for us to waste,
Got to take a leap of faith,
And fly, fly away
Yuna
Don't have to walk,
Now you can run,
Nothing can get in your way
Both
All of your tears will dry faster in the sun,
Yuna
Starting today,
Both
Shine, shine, shine,
Shine your way
Adam Young
Morning is breaking,
Yuna
Darkness is fading,
Both
We found a way to the light,
It's such a beautiful sight
Adam Young
Anytime, anywhere,
Turn around and I'll be there,
To shine, shine your way
Yuna
Like a star burning bright,
Lighting up the darkest night,
I'll shine, shine your way
Yuna
Now I can see,
Adam Young
You are the one,
Yuna
Sent here to show me the way
Both
All of your tears will dry faster in the sun,
Yuna
Starting today,
Both
Shine, shine, shine,
Adam Young
We're on our way,
Both
Shine, shine, shine,
That's what we say,
Shine, shine, shine,
Shine your way
Adam Young
There's a reason why
You shine, shine your way
Both
All of our tears will dry faster in the sun
Shine your way
