<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="Catch_The_Blues">
I've been willing to bet
You ain't got nothin' to lose
I ain't figured out yet
How you've been walking in my shoes
Somebody tell me how to talk to you
Ain't it funny
You might even
Catch the blues
I've been willing to bet
You ain't got nothing to say
I ain't figured out yet
How I've been getting in your way
Somebody tell me how to play for you
Ain't it funny
You might even
Catch the blues
Living in a world of pain
I've been living in a world of pain
Without you making the difference
Oh I've been going insane
But I can't go on without calling out your name
I've been willing to bet
You ain't got nothing to show
I ain't figure out yet
Where you've been pointed me to go
Somebody tell me how to get to you
Ain't it funny
You might even
Catch the blues
Living in a world of pain
I've been living in a world of pain
Without you making the difference
Oh I've been going insane
But I can't go on without calling out your name
