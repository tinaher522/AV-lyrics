<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="Lies">
You told me this, you told me that
You try to tell me, tell me where it's at
You said you loved me, I can see through that
Lies, lies, lies
You left me hangin', hangin' from a limb
You said you loved me, then you left with him
Lord, you did it to me, I see it in your eyes
Lies, lies, lies
Tell me baby, why you take my time
You get a thrill off, playing with my mind
Lord, you did it to me, I see it in your eyes
Lies, lies, lies
