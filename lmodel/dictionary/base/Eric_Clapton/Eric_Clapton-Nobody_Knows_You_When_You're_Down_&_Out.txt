<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="Nobody_Knows_You_When_You're_Down_&_Out">
Once I lived the life of a millionaire
Spent all my money, didn't have any care
Took all my friends out for a mighty good time
Bought bootleg liquor, champagne and wine
Then I began to fall so low
Lost all my good friends and nowhere to go
If I get my hands on a dollar again
I'll hang on to it till that eagle grins
'Cause no, nobody knows you
When you're down and out
In your pocket, not one penny
And as for friends, you don't have any
When you get back up on your feet again
Everybody wants to be your long-lost friend
I said it's strange, without any doubt
Nobody knows you when you're down and out
When you finally get back upon your feet again
Everybody wants to be your good old long-lost friend
Said it's mighty strange
Nobody knows you
Nobody knows you
Nobody knows you when you're down and out
