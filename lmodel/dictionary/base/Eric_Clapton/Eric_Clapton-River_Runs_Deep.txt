<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="River_Runs_Deep">
Well, the river runs deep and the water is cold as ice
River runs deep and the water is cold as ice
I go down there every chance I get
It's where my baby she met her death
And the river runs deep and the water's cold as ice
Ain't no woman gonna make a fool out of me
Ain't no woman gonna make a fool out of me
Running 'round, that's what they said
She's at the bottom of the river bed
And the river runs deep and the water's cold as ice
Cheating woman gonna get a good man down
Cheating woman gonna get a good man down
Running 'round like a silly fool
End up at the bottom of the pool
River runs deep and the water's cold as ice
River runs deep and the water's cold as ice
River runs deep and the water's cold as ice
That river runs deep and the water's cold as ice
River runs deep and the water's cold as ice
River runs deep and the water's cold as ice
