<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="Milkcow's_Calf_Blues">
Tell me, milk cow
What on Earth is wrong with you?
Ooh, milk cow
What on Earth is wrong with you?
Now you've left you a calf
And your milk is turning blue
Lord, your calf is hungry
And I believe he needs a suck
Lord, your calf is hungry
I believe he needs a suck
Well, your milk is turning blue
I believe he's out of luck
Now I feel like milking and my
Cow won't come
I feel like churning and my
Milk won't turn
I'm cryin', please
Ooh-hoo, don't do me wrong
If you see my milk cow, baby now
Ooh-hoo, please drive her home
Lord, my milk cow been rambling
Ooh-hoo, for miles around
Lord, my milk cow been rambling
Ooh-hoo, for miles around
Well, how can you suck on some other man's bull cow
Ooh-hoo, in this strange man's town?
