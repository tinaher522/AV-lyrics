<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="Till_Your_Well_Runs_Dry">
You said you love me
And then you left
Broke every promise
You won every bet
You never miss your water
Till your well runs dry
Tell me, tell me
Whatcha gonna do when your well runs dry?
Whatcha gonna do when your well runs dry?
Whatcha gonna do when your well runs dry?
I'd like to know
Whatcha gonna do when your well runs dry?
Listen to me darlin'
You cheat and you lie
Now you come a runnin'
Running, wanting second try
You never miss your water
Till your well runs dry
Tell me, tell me
Whatcha gonna do when your well runs dry?
Whatcha gonna do when your well runs dry?
Whatcha gonna do when your well runs dry?
I'd like to know
Whatcha gonna do when your well runs dry?
Sat down and I sighed
And I heard you packin'
But you said nothin',
I watch you pass by me
I know you're gonna miss me
You're gonna be so blue
Tell me, tell me
Whatcha gonna do when you're feelin' blue?
Whatcha gonna do when you're feelin' blue?
Whatcha gonna do when you're feeling blue?
I'd like to know
Whatcha gonna do when you're feelin' so blue?
You never miss you water
Till your well runs dry
Tell me, tell me
Whatcha gonna do when your well runs dry?
Whatcha gonna do when your well runs dry?
Repeats
