<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="Hello_Old_Friend">
As I am strolling down the garden path,
I saw a flower glowing in the dark.
It looked so pretty and it was unique;
I had to bend down just to have a peek.
Hello old friend,
It's really good to see you once again.
Hello old friend,
It's really good to see you once again.
I saw you walking underneath the stars;
I couldn't stop 'cause I was in a car.
I'm sure the distance wouldn't be too far
If I got out and walked to where you are.
Hello old friend,
It's really good to see you once again.
Hello old friend,
It's really good to see you once again.
An old man passed me on the street today;
I thought I knew him but I couldn't say.
I stopped to think if I could place his frame.
When he tipped his hat I knew his name.
Hello old friend,
It's really good to see you once again.
Hello old friend,
It's really good to see you once again.
Hello old friend,
It's really good to see you once again.
Hello old friend,
It's really good to see you once again.
