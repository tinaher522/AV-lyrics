<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="Travelin'_Alone">
I ain't gonna tell nobody
What Santa Fe 've done for me
I ain't gonna tell nobody
What Santa Fe 've done for me
If you want to know baby
You sure have to come and see
81's in the yardie
2's are on the road
81's in the yardie
2's are on the road
81 makes your living
82 put you out of door
Nobody knows on trouble
But the good Lord above
Nobody knows my trouble
But the good Lord above
Well you know how I feel
If ya'ever have been in love
Lord I ain't go down
That big road by myself
Lord I ain't go down
That big road by myself
If you can't go with me
Carry somebody else
I ain't gonna tell nobody
What Santa Fe 've done for me
I ain't gonna tell nobody
What Santa Fe 've done for me
If you want to know baby
You sure have to come and see
