<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="Somebody's_Knockin'">
Somebody's knocking
Somebody's knocking on my door
Well, it must be my woman
Coming 'round here for more
Somebody whispers
Somebody whispers in my ear
It must be my woman
I can feel her when she's near
O-o-o-o, she can get right down
Ah, it must be my woman
Make me love when I am down
