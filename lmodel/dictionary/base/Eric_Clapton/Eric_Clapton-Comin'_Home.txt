<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="Comin'_Home">
Been out on the road 'bout six months too long.
I want you so bad, I can hardly stand it.
I'm so tired and I'm all alone.
We'll soon be together and that's it;
I'm comin' home to your love.
Hitchhiking on the turnpike all day long.
Nobody seemed to notice, they just pass me over.
To keep from going crazy, I got to sing my song.
Got a whole lot of loving and baby, that's why
I'm comin' home to your love.
Coming home, yeah.
