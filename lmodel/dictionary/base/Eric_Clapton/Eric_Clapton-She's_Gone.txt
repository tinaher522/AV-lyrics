<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="She's_Gone">
In the middle of the night, in the middle of the day,
She can make me feel all right and make it all okay.
She can make me feel so good by looking in my eye.
She can take me to the edge, take me to the sky.
She's gone, she's gone, she's gone.
I'm telling you she's gone.
She put her hands in my hair, put her kiss on my face.
She puts my heart in my mouth, my soul in its place.
Who could love me like she do?  Who could even start to try?
She can love me more than you; I never wonder why.
She's gone, she's gone, she's gone.
I'm telling you she's gone.
She's gone, she's gone, she's gone.
I'm telling you she's gone.
Like a shadow in the dark, like a ripple on a stream,
I see her float across my mind like a picture in a dream.
And the more that I know, seems the more that I care.
Give the world and all I own just to know that she's still there.
Like a shadow in the dark, like a ripple in a stream,
But you're floating on my mind.
She's gone, she's gone, she's gone.
I'm telling you she's gone.
She's gone, she's gone, she's gone.
I'm telling you she's gone.
