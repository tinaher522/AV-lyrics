<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="Willie_And_The_Hand_Jive">
I know a cat named Way-out Willie
Got a cool little chick named Rocking Millie
He can walk and stroll and Susie Q
And do that crazy hand jive, too
Mama, mama, look at Uncle Joe
Doing the hand jive with Sister Flo
Grandma gave baby sister a dime
Said, "Do that hand jive one more time"
Hand jive, hand jive, hand jive
Do that crazy hand jive
Doctor and a lawyer and an Indian chief
They all dig that crazy beat
Way-out Willie gave them all a treat
When he did that hand jive with his feet
Hand jive, hand jive, hand jive
Do that crazy hand jive
Willie and Millie got married last fall
They had a little Willie Junior and that ain't all
Well, the kids got crazy and it's plain to see
Doing the hand jive on TV
Hand jive, hand jive, hand jive
Do that crazy hand jive
