<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="Pretending">
How many times must we tell the tale?
How many times must we fall?
Living in lost memory
You just recalled
Working on the sound of the band
Trying to get the music right
Two go out working
Three stay home at night
That's when she said she was pretending
Just like she knew the plan
That's when I knew she was pretending
Pretending to understand
Pretending
Pretending
Pretending
Pretending
Satisfied but lost in love
Situations change
You're never who you used to think you are
How strange
That's when she said she was pretending
Like she knew the plan
That's when I knew she was pretending
Pretending to understand
Pretending
Pretending
Pretending
Pretending
I get lost in alibis
Sadness can't prevail
Everybody knows
Strong love can't fail
Don't be pretending 'bout how you feel
Don't be pretending that your love is real
Don't be pretending 'bout how you feel
Don't be pretending that your love is real
Pretending
Pretending
Pretending (pretending)
Pretending
