<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="You_Better_Watch_Yourself">
You better stop drinking that wine, sonny boy
You better stop drinking that wine, sonny boy
Everybody going out, everybody going out enjoying
You better stop drinking that wine, sonny boy
You better stop drinking that gin, sonny boy
You better stop drinking that gin, sonny boy
Oh, you're gonna mess up your mind, yeah, you'll fly by, by
You better stop drinking that wine, sonny boy
Can't you hear your mama calling you?
Can't you hear your mama calling you?
You're gonna mess up your happy home
You're gonna wind up all alone, sonny boy
Stop drinking that wine, sonny boy
You better stop using those drugs, sonny boy
You better stop using those drugs, sonny boy
Yeah, if you don't stop popping those pills
You're gonna bring on those evil chills
You better stop drinking that wine, sonny boy
You better stop drinking that gin, sonny boy
You better stop drinking that gin, sonny boy
You think you're on a track but you don't know when to stop
You better stop drinking that wine, sonny boy, hey
Why don't you drink some hot green tea, sonny boy?
Why don't you drink some hot green tea, sonny boy?
Oh, it'll be better for you, better for your sweet tooth
Hey, you better stop drinking that wine, sonny boy
You better take it one day at a time
You better take it one day at a time
Oh, that wine, sonny boy
