<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="Catch_Me_If_You_Can">
Catch me if you can; I won't be easy to find.
I got a woman at home that's driving me out of my mind.
Catch me if you can; it won't be easy to do.
And I'm warning you brother I won't be leaving no clues.
Catch me if you can; I won't be leaving no scent.
I've been running the wrong way, I think it's time that I went.
Believe me, I'm a man; I ain't easy to tend.
And I'm moving on out, so catch me if you can.
There's no use bothering with the lost and found.
You'd better find a shovel, 'cause I've gone to ground.
Little girl never did pay me no mind.
I guess I'll have to go and leave her behind.  So . . .
Catch me if you can; I won't be easy to find.
I got a woman at home that's driving me out of my mind.
Catch me if you can; it won't be easy to do.
And I'm warning you brother I won't be leaving no clues.
Catch me if you can; I won't be easy to find.
I got a woman at home that's driving me out of my mind.
Catch me if you can; it won't be easy to do.
And I'm warning you brother I won't be leaving no clues.
Catch me if you can; I won't be easy to find.
I got a woman at home that's driving me out of my mind.
Catch me if you can; it won't be easy to do.
And I'm warning you brother I won't be leaving no clues.
