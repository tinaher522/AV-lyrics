<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="Sign_Language">
You speak to me in sign language
As I'm eating a sandwich in a small café
At a quarter to three
But I can't respond to your sign language
You're taking advantage, bringing me down
Can't you make any sound?
'Twas there by the bakery, surrounded by fakery
This is my story, still I'm still there
Does she know I still care?
Link Wray was playing on the jukebox I was paying
For the words I was saying, so misunderstood
He didn't do me no good
You speak to me in sign language
As I'm eating a sandwich in a small café
At a quarter to three
But I can't respond to your sign language
You're taking advantage, bringing me down
Can't you make any sound?
