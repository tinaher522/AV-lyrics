<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="Bad_Boy">
I'm just a bad boy, long long ways from home.
I'm just a bad boy, long long ways from home.
But I ain't got nobody to bury me when I'm dead and gone.
Well I'm the cat that scratches and I'm like a dog that bites.
I'll be your box of matches, baby, when you need a light.
I'm just a bad boy, long long ways from home.
I'm just a bad boy, long long ways from home.
But I ain't got nobody to bury me when I'm dead and gone.
I used to have a little girl, only 16 years old,
But her mom and dad put me way out, way out in the cold.
I can't stay here no longer, my luck is running slow.
Gotta keep on moving but I ain't got no place to go.
I'm just a bad boy, long long ways from home.
I'm just a bad boy, long long ways from home.
But I ain't got nobody to bury me when I'm dead and gone.
