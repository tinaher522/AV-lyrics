<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="Wanna_Make_Love_To_You">
How can I explain
This feeling that's true?
Honey, I can't hardly stand it,
I wanna make love to you.
I ain't gonna try to tell you
How it's made me so blue,
Sitting alone here and wondering.
I wanna make love to you.
Where the storms fall from the heavens
And the rivers, they stop their flow,
If you just stop and talk to me,
Honey, that's where I belong.
I wanna make love to you.
I wanna make love to you.
I wanna make love to you.
I wanna make love to you.
Please, stop and tell me,
Tell me you want me too.
Come on, baby,
I wanna make love to you.
I ain't gonna try to tell you
How it's made me so blue,
Sitting alone here and wondering.
I wanna make love to you.
Oh, darling.
I ain't gonna try to tell you
How it's made me so blue,
Sitting alone here and wondering.
I wanna make love to you.
I ain't gonna try to tell you
How it's made me so blue,
Sitting alone here and wondering.
I wanna make love to you.
I ain't gonna try to tell you
How it's made me so blue,
Sitting alone here and wondering.
I wanna make love to you.
