<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="Told_You_For_The_Last_Time">
Well, I've told you for the last time,
Told you for the last time.
I'm gonna turn on my love light,
Let it shine one more time,
Let it shine, shine, shine for the last time.
There's gonna be a big change made, and I'm gonna make it.
This time I'm gonna lay it on the line.
I got a lot to give when you're woman enough to take it, oh yeah.
Well, I've told you for the last time,
Told you for the last time.
I sure want to love you baby, baby if you'd only let me.
You only pick me up just to put me down.
I finally let my mind make a decision, oh yeah.
I'm gonna start my wheels a-spinnin',
Let 'em turn one more time,
Let 'em turn, oh yeah, for the last time.
I'm gonna turn on my love light,
Let it shine one more time,
Let it shine, shine, shine for the last time.
Well, I've told you for the last time,
Told you for the last time.
