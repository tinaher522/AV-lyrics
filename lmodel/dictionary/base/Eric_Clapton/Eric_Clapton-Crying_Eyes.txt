<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="Crying_Eyes">
It ain't easy
Drying these crying eyes of mine
It ain't easy
Drying these crying eyes of mine
I get so lonely
Lonely
Lonely
It ain't easy
Drying these crying eyes of mine
What can you do
When those tears make you blind
What can you do
When those tears make you blind
I get so lonely
Lonely
Lonely
What can you do
When those tears make you blind
I get so lonely
Lonely
Lonely
What can you do to me
With these crying eyes of mine
