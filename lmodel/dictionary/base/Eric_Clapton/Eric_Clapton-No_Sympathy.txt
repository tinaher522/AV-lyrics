<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="No_Sympathy">
I ain't findin' no,
No sympathy
What kind of love
They've got for me
I'm on my way
To happiness
If I can find
Some peace and rest
When I'm in troubles yeah
Only me can feel the pain
Not one good word of advice
From any of my so-called friends
I ain't findin' no,
No sympathy
What kind of love
They've got for me
I might as well might as well
Might as well get out of hell
Hell will never be made for me
I´m gonna search search til I´m free
I ain't findin' no,
No sympathy
What kind of love
They've got for me
I ain't findin' no,
No sympathy
What kind of love
They've got for me
What kind of love
What kind of love
I can't find no,
no sympathy
What kind a what kind of love
They've got for me
I'm on my way
To happiness
If I can find
Some peace and rest
Find peace and rest
What kind of love
They´ve got for me
