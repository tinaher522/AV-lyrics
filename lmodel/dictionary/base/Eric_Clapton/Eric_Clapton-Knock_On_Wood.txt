<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="Knock_On_Wood">
I don't want to lose you,
This good thing that I've got.
If I do, I would surely, surely lose a lot,
'Cause your love is better than any love I know.
It's like thunder, lightning,
The way you love me is frightening.
Think I'd better knock on wood, baby.
I'm not superstitious about you, I can't take no chance.
You got me spinning, baby.  Baby, I'm in a trance,
'Cause your love is better than any love I know.
It's like thunder, lightning,
The way you love me is frightening.
Think I'd better knock on wood, baby.
Ain't no secret, that woman is my loving cup.
She sees to it that I get it up.
Just one touch from her, you know can do so much.
It's like thunder, lightning,
The way you love me is frightening.
Think I'd better knock on wood, baby.
Think I better knock, knock, knock on wood.
Think I better knock, knock, knock on wood.
