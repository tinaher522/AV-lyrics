<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="All_Of_Me">
All of me, why not take all of me?
Can't you see I'm no good without you?
Take my lips, I wanna lose them
Take my arms, I never use them
Your goodbyes left me with eyes that cry
How can I go on without you?
You took the part that once was my heart
So why not take all of me?
Your goodbyes left me with eyes that cry
How can I go on without you?
You took the part that once was my heart
So why not take all of me?
Your goodbyes left me with eyes that cry
How can I go on without you?
You took the part that once was my heart
So why not take all of me?
