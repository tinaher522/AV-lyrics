<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="It's_In_The_Way_That_You_Use_It">
It's in the way that you use it
It comes and it goes
It's in the way that you use it
Boy, don't you know?
And if you lie you will lose it
Feelings will show
So don't you ever abuse it
Don't let it go
Nobody right till somebody wrong
Nobody weak till somebody strong
No one get lucky till luck comes along
Nobody lonely till somebody gone
It's in the way that you use it
It comes and it goes
It's in the way that you use it
Boy, don't you know, yeah
It's in the way that you use it
It comes and it goes
It's in the way that you use it
Boy, don't you know?
And if you lie you will lose it
Feelings will show
So don't you ever abuse it
Don't let it go
I've seen dark skies, never like this
Walked on some thin ice, never like this
I've told you white lies, never like this
Looked into true eyes, never like this
It's in the way that you use it
Boy, don't you know?
So don't you ever abuse it
Don't let it go, yeah
