<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="The_Sky_Is_Crying">
The sky is crying, look at the tears rolling down the streets.
The sky is crying, look at the tears rolling down the streets.
I looked out my window, the rain was falling down in sheets. 
My baby left me this morning, Lord knows I don't know the reason why.
My baby left me this morning, I don't know the reason why.
And everytime I think about it, I hang my head and cry. 
The sun is shining, although it's raining in my heart.
The sun is shining, although it's raining in my heart.
I love my baby, I hate to see us part.
