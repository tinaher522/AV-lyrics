<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="Rambling_On_My_Mind">
I got rambling, I got rambling all on my mind.
I got rambling, I got rambling all on my mind.
I hates to leave my baby, but she treats me so unkind.
I got mean things, I got mean things all on my mind.
I got mean things, I got mean things all on my mind.
I hates to leave my baby, but she treats me so unkind.
I'm going down to the station, catch the fastest train I see.
I'm going down to the station, catch the fastest train I see.
I got the blues 'bout miss so-and-so, and her son's got the blues about me.
I got rambling, I got rambling all on my mind.
I got rambling, I got rambling all on my mind.
I hates to leave my baby, but she treats me so unkind.
