<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="I_Can't_Hold_Out">
I just talked to my baby on the telephone,
She said, "Stop what you're doing and baby come on home."
I can't hold out, I can't hold out too long.
I get a real good feeling talking to you on the phone. 
You said, "Baby don't you worry, you're my heart's desire.
You know that I love you, I can't stand to see you cry."
I can't hold out, I can't hold out too long.
I get a real good feeling talking to you on the phone. 
She said, "Baby you can run, you can walk or fly.
You know that I love you, you're my heart's desire."
I can't hold out, I can't hold out too long.
I get a real good feeling talking to you on the phone, oh yeah. 
I talked to my baby, I talked to my baby.
I talked to my baby, I talked to my baby.
I get a real good feeling talking to you on the phone.
