<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="Pilgrim">
And how do I choose and where do I draw the line,
Between truth and necessary pain?
And how do I know and where do I get my belief,
That things will be all right again?
What words do I use to try and explain,
To those who have witnessed all my tears?
And what does it mean to know all these things,
When love's been wasted all these years
When love's been wasted all these years
Standing in the shadows
With my heart right in my hand
Removed from other people
Who could never understand
I was a pilgrim for your love
A pilgrim for your love
A pilgrim for your love
I was a pilgrim for your love
It's like living in a nightmare
Like looking in a blackest hole
Like standing on the edge of nothing
Completely out of control
Now where have I been all these years 
And how come I just couldn't see
Like a blind man walking 'round in darkness
I was a pilgrim for your love
I was a pilgrim for your love
Standing in the shadows with my heart right in my hand
Removed from other people who could never understand
Standing in the shadows with my heart right in my hand 
Removed from other people who could never understand
I was a pilgrim for your love
A pilgrim for your love...
I was a pilgrim for your love
A pilgrim for your love...
I was a pilgrim for your love 
A pilgrim for your love...
