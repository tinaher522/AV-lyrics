Say what you will
Good love is hard to find
I've had my fill of the hurtin' kind
Take alot of money
To buy up all the pain
Take alot of honey
To fill me up and put me back
on my feet again
You've seen the worst
Still you find the best of me
My love was cursed
Loosin' destiny
Take alot of livin'
To dry up all the tears
Take alot of grinnin'
To cheer me up and put me back
on my feet again
You know I needed a friend
I could tell my troubles to
And you have been my friend
So I will give my love to you
Good love from me to you

Here it comes again
I feel I'm not good enough
Can't remember when
it ever felt so tough
Take alot huggin'
Drive away the fear
Take alot of lovin'
To pick me up and put me back
on my feet again
You know I needed a friend
I could tell my troubles to
And you have been my friend
So I will give my love to you
Good love from me to you
I know you needed a friend
You could tell your troubles to
And I'll be your friend
And I will give my love to you
Good love from me to you
Good love
Good love
Good love from me to you
Good love
