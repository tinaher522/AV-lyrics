<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="Little_Queen_Of_Spades">
She is a little queen of spades
And the men will not let her be
Said she is a little queen of spades
And the men will not let her be
Everytime she make a spread
Ooh fair brown, cold chills run all over me
Gonna get me a gambling woman
If it's the last thing that I do
Gonna get me a gambling woman
If it's the last thing that I do
A man don't need a woman
Ooh fair brown, that he got to give all of his money to
Everybody said you got a mojo
'Cause baby, you've been using that stuff
Everybody said you got a mojo
Baby, you've been using that stuff
Got a way trimming down
Ooh fair brown, and I mean it's most too tough
Little girl, since I am the king
Baby, and you is the queen
Little girl, since I am the king
Baby, and you is the queen
Let us put our heads together
Ooh fair brown, and we can make our money green
