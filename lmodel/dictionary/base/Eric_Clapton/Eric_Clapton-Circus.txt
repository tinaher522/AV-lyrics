<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="Circus">
Little man with his eyes on fire
And his smile so bright
In his hands are the toys you gave
To fill his heart with delight
And in the ring stands a circus clown
Holding up a knife
What you see and what you will hear
Will last you for the rest of your life
And it's sad, so sad
There ain't no easy way round
And it's sad, so sad
All you friends gather round
'Cause the circus left town
Little man with his heart so pure
And his love so fine
Stick with me and I'll ride with you
Till the end of the line
