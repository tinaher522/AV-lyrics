<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="Little_Rachel">
You don't need no high I.Q.
To get right down and sing the blues.
If you're down, here's what to do;
Me and my guitar will sing for you.
Oh, little Rachel, oh.
Oh, little Rachel, oh.
Oh, little Rachel, oh.
Oh, little Rachel, oh.
I got a box and an old whisk broom.
We gonna rock around the room.
When my guitar plays this tune,
We gonna dance to the light of the moon.
Oh, little Rachel, oh.
Oh, little Rachel, oh.
Oh, little Rachel, oh.
Oh, little Rachel, oh.
What you feel, that ain't no jive.
The get down sound makes you feel alive.
Oh, little Rachel, oh.
Oh, little Rachel, oh.
Oh, little Rachel, oh.
Oh, little Rachel, oh.
Push it, little Rachel, push it.
Push it, little Rachel, push it.
Pull it, little Rachel, pull it.
Pull it, little Rachel, pull it.
