<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="Kind_Hearted_Woman_Blues">
I've got a kind hearted woman, she studies evil all the time
I've got a kind hearted woman, she studies evil all the time
You would do to quit me just to have it on your mind
I've got a kind hearted woman, do anything in this world for me
I've got a kind hearted woman, do anything in this world for me
But these evil hearted women, Lord, and they will not let me be
Now it ain't but one thing makes Mr. Clapton drink
I swear about how you treat me baby, I begin to think
Oh baby, my life don't feel the same
It breaks my heart when you call Mr. So-and-So's name
She's a kind hearted woman, she studies evil all the time
She's a kind hearted woman, she studies evil all the time
You're best to quit me baby as just to have it on your mind
