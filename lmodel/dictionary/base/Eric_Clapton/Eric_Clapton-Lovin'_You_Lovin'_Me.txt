<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="Lovin'_You_Lovin'_Me">
I am so in love for once in my life.
In my dreams, I've known you many times before.
And I so want you to be my dear wife,
As only you can satisfy me any more,
And only you can love me more.
I'm lovin' you lovin' me lovin' you.
It's all the same; when loving, two together makes one.
Everybody sing la, la la la, la la la, la la la.
It's all the same, and we are one.
I will give you a world of your dreams if you want them.
I can feel the power when you're standing there.
Someone sent me you; oh lord, I will thank him,
And all the rest, it just don't matter,
And all the rest and all the rest.
I'm lovin' you lovin' me lovin' you.
It's all the same; when loving, two together makes one.
Everybody sing la, la la la, la la la, la la la.
It's all the same, and we are one.
Loving you.
You know I love you.
