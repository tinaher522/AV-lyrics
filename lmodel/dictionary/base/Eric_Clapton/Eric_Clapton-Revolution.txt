<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="Revolution">
I told you once, I told you twice
You never listen to my advice
Good kind treatment, I'm threw with you
Won't get to heaven, I don't care what you do
I seen you changin from day to day
Nothin never gets in your way
Don't feel nothin for no one else
Take what you want, jus help yo self
(chorus)
(say you wanna, say you wanna)
Now you want a Revolution
(Want a revolution)
A revolution now
(Say you wanna, say you wanna)
Say you wanna a revolution
(Wanna revolution)
A revolution now
(Told you once) I told you twice 
(Ya never listen) To my advice
(Now your out there)  Your on your own
Ain't got no friends, ain't got no home
(Getting mad)
I'm gettin mad at you  (Mad at you)
Just don't like the way you do
Don't know where you think you been
But your goin to wind up back there again
(Chorus)
(say you wanna, say you wanna)

Now you want a Revolution
(Want a revolution)
A revolution now
(Say you wanna, say you wanna)
You wanna a revolution
(Wanna revolution)
A revolution now
Say wanna revolution
(Say you wanna, say you wanna)
Do you wanna revolution now?
(Revolution, a Revolution now)
(Time has come) and it won't be long
For you to see where you come from
(You can't go back) Can't go back, can't stay the same
No one but yourself to blame
(Chorus)
(say you wanna, say you wanna)
Now you want a Revolution
(Want a revolution)
A revolution now
(Say you wanna, say you wanna)
You wanna a revolution
(Wanna revolution)
A revolution now
(Say you wanna, say you wanna)
Do you wanna revolution now?
(Revolution, a Revolution now)
repeat
