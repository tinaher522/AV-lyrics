<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="Pretty_Girl">
Pretty girl you are the light of my life, I mean my everything
You're the one I chose to make my wife, that's why you wear my ring.
And when I'm feeling down and out, you're the one who will bail me out
My love will always guide me home, pretty girl.
Pretty girl don't ever say goodbye, don't ever let me be,
If you do you know that I will die, you mean that much to me.
And when I'm feeling low and blue you always know just what to do.
My love will always guide me home, pretty girl.
Pretty girl, hear what I have to say, it's something you should know,
You brought me sunshine on my darkest day, that's why I love you so.
And when my wandering day is through, I'll always hurry back home to you.
My love will always guide me home, pretty girl.
