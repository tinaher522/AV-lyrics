<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="Traveling_Riverside_Blues">
If your man gets personal
Want you to have your fun
If your man gets personal
Want you to have your fun
Well, come on back to Friar's Point, mama
Barrelhouse all night long
I got womens in Vicksburg
Clean on into Tennessee
I got womens in Vicksburg
Clean on into Tennessee
But my Friar's Point rider now
Hops all over me
I ain't gon' to state no color, but
Her front teeth is crowned with gold
I ain't gon' to state no color, but
Her front teeth is crowned with gold
She got a mortgage on my body, Lord
A lien on my soul
Well, I'm goin' down to Rosedale
Rider by my side
Lord, I'm goin' down to Rosedale
Rider by my side
Well, we can still barrelhouse, baby
On the riverside
You can squeeze my lemon till
The juice run down my leg
You can squeeze my lemon till
The juice run down my leg
(That's what I'm talkin' about)
But I'm goin' back to Friar's Point, mama
Rockin' to my head
