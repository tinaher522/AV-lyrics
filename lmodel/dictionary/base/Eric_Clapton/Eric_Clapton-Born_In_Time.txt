<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="Born_In_Time">
In the lonely night,
In the stardust of a pale moonlight,
I think of you in black and white
When we were made of dreams.
I walked alone through the shaky streets,
Listening to my heart beat
In the record-breaking heat
When we were born in time.
Just when I thought you were gone, you came back
Just when I was ready to receive you.
You were smooth, you were rough,
You were more than enough.
Ah babe, why did I ever leave you
Or believe you?
In the rising curve,
Where the ways of nature will test every nerve,
I took you close and got what I deserve
When we were born in time.
Just when I knew who to thank, you went blank
Just as the firelight was gleaming.
You were snow, you were rain,
You were stripes and you were plain.
Oh babe, can it be you've been scheming
Or was I dreaming?
In the hills of mystery,
In the foggy web of destiny,
You're still so deep inside of me
When we were born in time.
