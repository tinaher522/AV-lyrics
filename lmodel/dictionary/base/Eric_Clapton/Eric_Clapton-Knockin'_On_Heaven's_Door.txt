Ma, take this badge off of me
I can't use it anymore
It's gettin' dark, too dark to see
Feel like I'm knockin' on heaven's door
Knock knock knockin' on heaven's door
Knock knock knockin' on heaven's door
Knock knock knockin' on heaven's door
Knock knock knockin' on heaven's door
Ma, take these guns away from me
I can't shoot them anymore
There's a long black cloud, following me
Feels like I'm knockin' on heaven's door
Knock, knock, knockin'
Knock knock knockin' on heaven's door
Knock knock knockin' on heaven's door
Ma, take this badge off of me
I can't use it anymore
It's getting dark, too dark to see
Feel like I'm knockin' on heaven's door
Knock knock knockin' on heaven's door
Knock knock knockin' on heaven's door
Knock knock knockin' on heaven's door
Knock knock knockin' on heaven's door
