<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="Hoodoo_Man">
Well I wonder what's exactly the matter.
Child you know the time.
Seemed like an hour.
Everything had changed.
I hold up my head.
Girl, I'm just trying to make you understand.
Well now, everybody tell me
Somebody hoodoo'd the hoodoo man.
Well now, I buzzed your bell this morning;
You had your elevator running slow.
I buzzed your bell in, woman,
Take me on the third floor.
I hold up my head.
Girl, I'm just trying to make you understand.
Well now, everybody tell me
Somebody hoodoo'd the hoodoo man.
I hold up my head.
Girl, I'm just trying to make you understand.
Well now, everybody tell me
Somebody hoodoo'd the hoodoo man.
I hold up my head.
Girl, I'm just trying to make you understand.
Well now, everybody tell me
Somebody hoodoo'd the hoodoo man.
Well I wonder what's exactly the matter.
Child you know the time.
Seemed like an hour.
Everything had changed.
I hold up my head.
Girl, I'm just trying to make you understand.
Well now, everybody tell me
Somebody hoodoo'd the hoodoo man.
