<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="Stop_Breakin'_Down_Blues">
Every time I'm walking
Down the street
Some pretty mama
Start breakin' down with me
Stop breakin' down
Please, stop breakin' down
The stuff I got will bust your brains out, baby
Ooh-hoo, it'll make you lose your mind
I can't walk the streets now
To consolate my mind
Some pretty mama
Starts breakin' down
Stop breakin' down
Please, stop breakin' down
The stuff I got will bust your brains out, baby
Ooh-hoo, it'll make you lose your mind
Now, you Saturday night women
You love to ape and clown
Won't do nothing
But tear a good man reputation down
Stop breakin' down
Please, stop breakin' down
The stuff I got will bust your brains out, baby
Ooh-hoo, it'll make you lose your mind
Well now, give my baby
The ninety-nine degrees
She jumped up
And throwed a pistol down on me
Stop breakin' down
Please, stop breakin' down
The stuff I got will bust your brains out, baby
Ooh-hoo, it'll make you lose your mind
Well now, I can't start walking
Down the streets
Some pretty woman
Start breakin' down with me
Stop breakin' down
Please, stop breakin' down
The stuff I got will bust your brains out, baby
Ooh-hoo, it'll make you lose your mind
