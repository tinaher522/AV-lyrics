<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="Reconsider_Baby">
So long, oh I hate to see you go
So long, oh I hate to see you go
And the way that I will miss you, I guess you will never know
We've been together so long to have to separate this way
We've been together so long to have to separate this way
I'm gonna let you go ahead on now baby, pray that you'll come back home someday
You said you once had loved me, but now I guess you've changed your mind
You said you once had loved me, but now I guess you've changed your mind
Why don't you reconsider baby? Give yourself just a little more time
