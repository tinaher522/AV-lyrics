<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="Sensitive_Kind">
Don't take her for granted
She has a hard time
Don't misunderstand her
Or play with her mind
Treat her so gently
It will pay you in time
You've got to know
She's the sensitive kind
Tell her you love her
Each and every night
You will discover
She will treat you right
If you believe
I know you will find
There ain't nothing like
The sensitive kind
She gets so lonely
Waiting for you
You are the only
Thing to help her through
Don't take her for granted
She has a hard time
You've got to know
She's the sensitive kind
