<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="Someday">
Someday she'll be here, that's a fact
Someday, she'll be coming right back
Maybe I'm dreaming
I hope it's not so, but
Someday she's comin' back I know
You know I'm ready, to see her again
When that someday will never end
When she left with no goodbye
I was stuck with those lonely nights
You know what I mean, it's always the same
Ain't no medicine for that kind of pain
Someday comes and goes away
Bringing me a better day
Ain't no pity, ain't no shame
I hope that someday will come again
Maybe I'm dreaming
I hope it's not so
Somedays' comin', it's comin' I know
Maybe I'm dreaming
I hope it's not so
Somedays' comin', it's comin' I know
