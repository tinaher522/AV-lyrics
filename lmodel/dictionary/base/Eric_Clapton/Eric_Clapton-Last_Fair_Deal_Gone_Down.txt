<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="Last_Fair_Deal_Gone_Down">
It's the last fair deal goin' down
Last fair deal goin' down
It's the last fair deal goin' down, good Lord
On that Gulfport Island Road
Ida Belle, don't cry this time
Ida Belle, don't cry this time
If you cry about a nickel, you'll die 'bout a dime
She wouldn't cry, but the money won't mine
I love the way you do
I love the way you do
I love the way you do, good Lord
On that Gulfport Island Road
My captain's so mean on me
My captain's so mean on me
My captain's so mean on me, good Lord
On this Gulfport Island Road
This camp ain't be at seen
Camp ain't be at seen
Well, this camp ain't be at seen, good Lord
On this Gulfport Island Road
Ah, this last fair deal goin' down
It's the last fair deal goin' down
This' the last fair deal goin' down, good Lord
On that Gulfport Island Road
You know, I'm workin' my way back home
Working my way back home
Lord, I'm workin' my way back home, good Lord
On this Gulfport Island Road
And that thing don't keep a-ringin' so soon
That thing don't keep a-ringin' so soon
And that thing don't keep a-ringin' so soon, good Lord
On that Gulfport Island Road
