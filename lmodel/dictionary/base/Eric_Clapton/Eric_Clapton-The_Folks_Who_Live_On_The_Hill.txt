<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="The_Folks_Who_Live_On_The_Hill">
Someday we'll build a home on a hilltop high
You and I
Shiny and new, a cottage that two can fill
And we'll be pleased to be called
The folks who live on the hill
Someday we may be addin'
A wing or two, a thing or two
We will make changes, as any family will
But we will always be called
The folks who live on the hill
Our veranda will command a view of meadows green
The sort of view that seems to want to be seen
And when the kids grow up and leave us
We'll sit and look at that same old view
Just we two
Darby and Joan used to be Jack and Jill
The folks who like to be called
What they have always been called
The folks who live on the hill
The folks who live on the hill
