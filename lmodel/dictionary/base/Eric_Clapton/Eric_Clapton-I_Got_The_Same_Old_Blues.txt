<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="I_Got_The_Same_Old_Blues">
Have you heard that rumour that's going around
You got it made, way across town
It's the same old story, tell me where does it end
Yes, I heard the news, it's the same old blues again
When I wrote you a letter, you must have read it wrong
I stood at your doorway but you were gone
I took a lot of courage and let the telephone ring
It's the same old blues, same old blues again
When you give me the business, you know I get a mind
'Cause I've got a lot of patience and I've got a lot of time
It's the same old story, tell me where does it end
It's the same old blues, same old blues again
I'm gonna find me a mountain, I'm gonna hide out
I ain't talking to you and I ain't coming out
Yes, I heard that rumour, tell me where does it end
It's the same old blues, same old blues again
