<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="You_Were_There">
We made the distance,
Yeah, we made the day.
You made all the difference
'Cause you found the way.
Without your wisdom
Lord, where would we be
Lost in the wilderness,
Somewhere out at sea.
But you were there
Through the days of wine and madness,
When I'd always put you down.
You were there
Through my joys and my sadness
And you never let me down.
You found the meaning
And helped me to see
Where I was going to
All that I could be.
Without permission
You turned the key.
You climbed the prison wall
Deep inside of me.
You were there
Through the days of wine and madness
When I'd turn and put, put you down.
You were there
Through my joys and my sadness
And you never let me down.
You were there
Through the days of wine and madness
When I'd turn and put, put you down.
You were there
Through my joys and my sadness
And you never let me down.
Let me down.
You were there.
You were there.
You were there.
