<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="Don't_Wait">
Don't wait, don't wait
Don't wait for the good times to come
We got 'em right here, we're on the run
Don't wait, don't wait
Going back, going back
Going way back, back in time
Another place, another mind
Going back, going back
Walk on, walk on
Walk on straight ahead
Don't look around, don't turn your head
Walk on, walk on
Fly away, fly away
Fly away, away with me
I never been so flying free
Fly away, fly away
Bye-bye, bye-bye
Please don't ever say
You're leaving me, you're going away
Bye-bye, bye-bye
