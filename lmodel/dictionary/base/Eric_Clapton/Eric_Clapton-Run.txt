<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="Run">
Love on my mind, I used to be
Living it up, fancy free,
Then one night it came to an end;
I met that girl and the trouble began.
Something inside of me keeps on telling me to run.
Whatcha gonna do to me?
Something inside of me keeps on telling me to run.
Whatcha gonna do to me?
I was hooked with just one look,
Easy prey, child's play.
I knew this girl was no one night stand;
Felt just like putty in her hands.
Something inside of me keeps on telling me to run.
Whatcha gonna do to me?
Something inside of me keeps on telling me to run.
Whatcha gonna do to me?
Got no answers, got no cure,
But one thing I know for sure:
This is the girl, she's the one.
She makes it so hard for me to run.
Something inside of me keeps on telling me to run.
Whatcha gonna do to me?
Something inside of me keeps on telling me to run.
Whatcha gonna do to me?
People tell me,
You might as well face it, she's covered all the bases.
You might as well face it, she's covered all the bases.
Something inside of me keeps on telling me to run.
Whatcha gonna do to me?
Something inside of me keeps on telling me to run.
Whatcha gonna do to me?
Something inside of me keeps on telling me to run.
Whatcha gonna do to me?
Something inside of me keeps on telling me to run.
Whatcha gonna do to me?
