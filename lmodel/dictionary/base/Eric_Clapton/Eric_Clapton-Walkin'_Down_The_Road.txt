<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="Walkin'_Down_The_Road">
Have you ever been walking down that lonesome road?
Have you ever been walking, walking down that lonesome road?
All you got in this world, Lord I declare she's dead and gone.
Things look so black, you got to travel alone.
Things look so black, you got to travel alone.
All you got in this world, Lord I declare she's gone.
It ain't too good, ain't got a shelter over your head.
It don't look so good, when you ain't got a shelter over your head.
When you could have been sleeping on a feather bed, yeah.
Walkin'.
Have you ever been walking, walking down that lonesome road?
Have you ever been walking, walking down that lonesome road?
When all you got in this world, Lord I declare she's gone.
