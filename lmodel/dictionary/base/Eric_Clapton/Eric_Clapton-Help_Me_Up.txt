<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="Help_Me_Up">
Are you going to help me
Or will you let me down?
I'm looking for a true love
But am I lost or found?
 
And will we cry in passion
Or will we cry in pain?
And will our lonely teardrops
Fill the world with rain?
 
Help me up,
Don't you let me down.
I'm gonna wake up in heaven,
Not the cold, cold ground.
 
Can't you hear the lovers
Crying in the night?
They spend their whole lives trying;
Still can't get it right.
 
I don't know where we're going
But I guess we'll start
And just to show that I mean it,
Baby here's my heart.
 
Help me up,
Don't you let me down.
I'm gonna wake up in heaven,
Not the cold, cold ground.
 
Living on my feelings,
Feelings all I know.
Baby once we touch it,
We'll never let it go.
 
Are you going to help me
Or will you let me down?
I'm looking for a true love
But am I lost or found?
 
And will we cry in passion
Or will we cry in pain?
And will our lonely teardrops
Fill the world with rain?
 
Help me up,
Don't you let me down.
I'm gonna wake up in heaven,
Not the cold, cold ground.
 
Help me up,
Don't you let me down.
I'm gonna wake up in heaven,
Not the cold, cold ground.
