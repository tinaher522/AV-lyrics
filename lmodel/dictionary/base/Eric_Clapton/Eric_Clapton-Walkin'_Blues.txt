<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="Walkin'_Blues">
Woke up this morning
Feel 'round for my shoes,
You know 'bout that babe
Had them old walkin' blues.
Woke up this morning 
I feel 'round for my shoes,
You know 'bout that babe
Lord, I had them old walkin' blues.
Leavin' this morning
I had to go ride the blinds.
I've been mistreated
Don't mind dying.
This morning
I had to go ride the blinds,
I've been mistreated
Lord, I don't mind dying. 
People tell me
"Walkin' blues ain't bad"
Worst old feeling 
I most ever had.
People tell me 
"The old walkin' blues ain't bad"
Well it's the worst old feeling
Lord, I most ever had.
