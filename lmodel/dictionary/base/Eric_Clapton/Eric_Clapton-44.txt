<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="44">
I wore my .44 so long, I made my shoulder sore.
I wore my .44 so long, I made my shoulder sore.
Well, I'm going down in the valley, where my baby's gone.
I'm so mad this morning, I don't know where in the world to go.
I'm so mad this morning, I don't know where in the world to go.
Well, I'm gonna get me some money, or I'll just have some dough.
I wore my .44 so long, I made my shoulder sore.
I wore my .44 so long, I made my shoulder sore.
Well, I'm going down in the valley, where my baby's gone.
