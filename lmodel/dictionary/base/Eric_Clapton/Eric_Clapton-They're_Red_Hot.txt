Hot tamales and they're red hot
Yes, she got 'em for sale
Hot tamales and they're red hot
Yes, she got 'em for sale
I got a girl, say she long and tall
Sleeps in the kitchen with her feet in the hall
Hot tamales and they're red hot
Yes, she got 'em for sale
Yes, she got 'em for sale
Hot tamales and they're red hot
Yes, she got 'em for sale
Hot tamales and they're red hot

She got two for a nickel, got four for a dime
Would sell you more, but they ain't none of mine
