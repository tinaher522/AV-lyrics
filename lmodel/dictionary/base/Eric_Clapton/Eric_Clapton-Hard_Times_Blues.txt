<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="Hard_Times_Blues">
Now it's hard time, baby, hard times everywhere I go
Hard times, baby, hard times everywhere I go
Now these people keep cryin' 'bout hard times, they comin' more and more
Now I don't even see what these poor people is going to do
Now I can't see what people, these poor people is going to do
Keep cryin' about these hard times and they coming more and more
Now I went to the factory this mornin' where I had worked ten years ago
And I went to the factory this mornin' where I had worked ten years ago
And the bossman told me that they ain't hirin' in here no more
Hard times, boy, and it's hard times everywhere I go
Hard times, boy, hard times everywhere I go
These people keep crying 'bout hard times and there's no work in here no more
Now if I was a bluebird, mama, had my trunk packed on my back
Hey if I was a bluebird, had my trunk packed on my back
I would fly away from this town, mama, and I'd swear I would never come back.
