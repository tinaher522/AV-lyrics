God is warning the nations,
Warning them in every way
To turn away from the evil
And seek the Lord and pray.
We've been told that God done warned us,
Jesus coming soon.
We've been told that God done warned us,
Jesus coming soon.

Warning them in every way
To turn away from the evil
And seek the Lord and pray.
We've been told that God done warned us,
Jesus coming soon.

Jesus coming soon.
