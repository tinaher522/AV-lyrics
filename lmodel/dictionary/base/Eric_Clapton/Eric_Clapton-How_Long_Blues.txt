<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="How_Long_Blues">
How long, baby how long
Has that evening train been gone?
How long, how how long, baby how long? 
Went to the station, didn't see no train
Down in my heart, I have an aching pain
How long, how how long, baby how long? 
I feel disgusted, I feel so bad
Thinking 'bout the good time that I once had had
How long, how how long, baby how long? 
I could see the green grass growing on the hill;
I ain't seen no greenback on a dollar bill
How long, how how long, baby how long? 
You're gonna be sorry you feel so blue
When you want me, baby, I declare I want, want you
How long, how how long, baby how long? 
Don't have no money for to ride the train
I would ride the rugs, baby, to be with you again
How long, how how long, baby how long? 
How long, baby how long
Must I keep my, my watching point?
How long, how how long, baby how long?
