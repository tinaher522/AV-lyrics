<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="Groupie_(Superstar)">
Long ago, so far away
I fell in love with you before the second show.
Your guitar it sounds so sweet and clear
But it's just the radio and you're not really here.
(Don't you remember you told me you love me, baby ?)
(You said you'd be coming back this way again, baby)
(Don't you remember you told me you love me, baby ?)
Loneliness is such a sad affair
And I can hardly wait to sleep with you again.
What to say to make you come again ?
Come back and play for me your sad guitar.
(Don't you remember you told me you love me, baby ?)
(You said you'd be coming back this way again, baby)
(Don't you remember you told me you love me, baby ?)
(Don't you remember you told me you love me, baby ?)
(You said you'd be coming back this way again, baby)
(Don't you remember you told me you love me, baby ?)
