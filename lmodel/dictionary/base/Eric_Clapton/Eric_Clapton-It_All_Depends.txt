<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="It_All_Depends">
So you think you are something special;
I wonder why, baby, is that so?
Could admit, you are something special.
Won't you tell me, girl?  I'd love to know.
Yes, I've seen you with your other girlfriends.
I can tell they really think you're fine.
And I've seen you with your other men friends.
They don't know if you're a love of mine.
It all depends on how you feel, baby.
I've got to know just how you feel, baby.
It all depends on how you feel, baby.
I've got to know just how you feel, baby.
It all depends on how you feel, baby.
I've got to know just how you feel, baby.
It all depends on how you feel, baby.
I've got to know just how you feel, baby.
'Cause you've taken away
The only thing I've ever ever had.
Don't you know that I loved you?
Why'd you make me feel bad?
The only thing I ever loved
Was loving you.
So you think you are something special;
I wonder why, baby, is that so?
Could admit, you are something special.
Won't you tell me, girl?  I'd love to know.
It all depends on how you feel, baby.
I've got to know just how you feel, baby.
It all depends on how you feel, baby.
I've got to know just how you feel, baby.
What makes you think you are something special?
