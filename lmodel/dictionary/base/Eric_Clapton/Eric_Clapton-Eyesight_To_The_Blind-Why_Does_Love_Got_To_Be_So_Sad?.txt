<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="Eyesight_To_The_Blind-Why_Does_Love_Got_To_Be_So_Sad?">
You talk about your woman
I wish you could see mine
You talk about your woman
I wish you could see mine
Every time she starts to lovin'
She brings eyesight to the blind
Oh yeah
You know her daddy gave her magic
I can tell by the way she walks
You know, her daddy gave her magic
I can tell by the way she walks
Every time she starts to shake
The dumb begin to talk
Talk, talk, talk!
She's got the power to heal you, never fear
She has got the power to heal you, never fear
Just one word from her lips
And the deaf can hear
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Gotta find me a way
Get me back to yesterday
How can I ever hope to forget you
Won't you show me a place
Where I could hide my lonely face
I know you're gonna break my heart if I let you
Why does love got to be so sad?
Why does love got to be so sad?
Why does love got to be so sad?
Why does love got to be so sad?
Like a moth to the flame
Like a song without a name
I've never been the same since I met you
Like a bird on the wing
Got a brand new song to sing
I can't keep from singing about you
Why does love got to be so sad?
Why does love got to be so sad?
Why does love got to be so sad?
Why does love got to be so sad?
I'm beginning to see
What a fool you've made of me
I might have to break the law when I find you
Stop running away
I got a better game to play
You know I can't go on living without you
Why does love got to be so sad?
Why does love got to be so sad?
Why does love got to be so sad?
Why does love got to be so ...
