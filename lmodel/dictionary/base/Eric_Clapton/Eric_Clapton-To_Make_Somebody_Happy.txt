<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="To_Make_Somebody_Happy">
Feel like someone's put the hurt on me,
And it's making me feel sad.
Feel like someone's trying to turn me away
From the good times to the bad.
Feel like someone's trying to teach me
What is wrong from what is right.
And I can't belong to everyone;
Let me stay with you tonight.
And I hope it makes somebody happy.
Lord, I hope it makes somebody happy.
This river's hard enough for me to swim,
But there's nowhere left to hide.
I ain't no swimmer but I won't give in
Till I reach the other side.
And I hope it makes somebody happy.
Lord, I hope it makes somebody happy.
'Cause it's all to make somebody happy.
It takes us all to make somebody happy.
