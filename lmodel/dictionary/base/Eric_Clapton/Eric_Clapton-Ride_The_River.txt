<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="Ride_The_River">
Floating down that old riverboy
All my worries far behind
Floating down that old riverboy
Leave all memories way behind
Yesterday slowly think all my life
I've been waiting for this time
Floating down that old riverboy
Leaves me feeling good inside
Floating down that old riverboy
Trying to get to the other side
Yesterday slowly think I've been
Waiting now and forever for this ride

Floating down that old riverboy
All my worries far behind
Floating down that old riverboy
Leave all memories way behind
Yesterday slowly think I've been
Waiting now and forever for this ride
Ride the river in this boat
Ride the river
