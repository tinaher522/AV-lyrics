<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="County_Jail_Blues">
They picked me up, put me in the county jail.
They picked me up, put me in the county jail.
They wouldn't let my woman come and post my bail.
Now I'm in prison, I've almost done my time.
Now I'm in prison, I've almost done my time.
They gave me six months, I had to work out nine.
I know my baby, she's gonna jump and shout.
I know my baby, she's gonna jump and shout.
When the train comes in and I come walking out.
Take these stripes from around me, chains from around my legs.
Take these stripes from around me, chains from around my legs.
The stripes don't hurt me; the chains could kill me dead.
