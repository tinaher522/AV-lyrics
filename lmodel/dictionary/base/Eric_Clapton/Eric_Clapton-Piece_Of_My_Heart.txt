<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="Piece_Of_My_Heart">
My life was always draggin on 
You showed me how to be in love 
I realize when you were gone 
And I love everything about you baby 
'cause your the vision in my mind 
Your spirit is so sweet and strong 
You help me up when I'm broken down 
And I love everything about you baby 
Never let our love fall away 
'cause this is heaven when your close to me 
Oh, it flows like a river 
'cause this is heaven when your close to me 
And I'll give a piece 
A piece of my heart 
'cause you're the star in all my dreams 
You keep me goin on and on 
No one knows what you do for me 
And I love everything about you baby 
Never let our love fall away 
'cause this is heaven when your close to me 
Oh, it flows like a river 
'cause this is heaven when your close to me 
And I'll give a piece 
A piece of my heart 
(don't let go) 
(I'm livin for ya baby) 
(don't let go) 
(I'm livin for ya baby) 
(don't let go) 
(I'm livin for ya baby) 
(don't let go) 
(I'm livin for ya baby) 
Never let your love fall away 
And I love everything about you baby 
This is heaven when your close to me 
Oh, it flows like a river 
This is heaven when your close to me 
And I'll give a piece of my heart 
This is heaven when your close to me 
Oh, it flows like a river 
This is heaven when your close to me 
And I'll give a piece of my heart 
(heaven...close to me) 
(heaven...close to me) 
(I'll give a piece, piece of my heart) 
(I'll give a piece, piece of my heart)
