<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="Watch_Yourself">
You better watch yourself,
You better watch yourself,
You better watch yourself,
I got my eye on you.
You steal my love and go away.
Don't tell me you'll see me another day.
You better watch yourself,
You better watch yourself,
You better watch yourself,
I got my eye on you.
You've gone and left me, left me here to cry.
You know I love you, know you're my desire.
You better watch yourself,
You better watch yourself,
You better watch yourself,
I got my eye on you.
I give you all my love, everything too,
Fine Cadillac, tell me what you gonna do.
You better watch yourself,
You better watch yourself,
You better watch yourself,
I got my eye on you.
People are talking all over town.
You say you don't love me, you're gonna put me down.
You better watch yourself,
You better watch yourself,
You better watch yourself,
I got my eye on you.
Tell me what's the matter, what you gonna do?
You say you're going to quit me then you say we're through.
You better watch yourself,
You better watch yourself,
You better watch yourself,
I got my eye on you.
You better watch yourself,
You better watch yourself,
You better watch yourself,
You better watch yourself,
You better watch yourself,
I got my eye on you.
