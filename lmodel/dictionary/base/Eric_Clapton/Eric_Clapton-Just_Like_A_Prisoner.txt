<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="Just_Like_A_Prisoner">
Just like a prisoner, he don't know right from wrong.
Just like a baby, he sings a pleading song
And that's why so many tears must fall.
Yes, that's why so many tears must fall.
Just like a sailor, he steers away from home.
He feels a tidal wave in his heart, but he ain't alone
And that's why so many tears must fall.
Yes, that's why so many tears must fall.
I'm like that prisoner, I don't know right from wrong.
Just like that baby, I sing a pleading song
And that's why you'll never know how I feel.
Yes, that's why you'll never know how I feel.
