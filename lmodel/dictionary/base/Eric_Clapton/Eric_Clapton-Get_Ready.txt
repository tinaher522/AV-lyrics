<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="Get_Ready">
Ready, get ready.  Ready.
He's a man who's going to break your heart.
Ready, get ready.  Ready.
He's a man who's going to break your heart.
Well, you've been fooling 'round and I don't know why.
Left me on my own, sitting high and dry.
But I'm going to get you back, just you wait and see;
You can't do those things that you're doing to me.
Ready, get ready.  Ready.
He's a man who's going to break your heart.
Ready, get ready.  Ready.
He's a man who's going to break your heart.
I've never needed a running 'round pissing hound,
Checking out the bitches in heat.
You've got a lot of nerve, dishing out what you serve,
Waggling your piece of meat.
Ready, get ready.  Ready.
He's a man who's going to break your heart.
Ready, get ready.  Ready.
He's a man who's going to break your heart.
I want to get revenge on your sinful sins.
I got to get you back for what you did back then.
And now you've got it back, life is misery.
Well, ha ha ha to you, ha ha to me.
Ready, get ready.  Ready.
He's the one that's going to break your heart.
Ready, get ready.  Ready.
He's the one that's going to break your heart, break your heart,
Break your heart, break your heart.
Get ready, get ready, get ready.
He's the one who's going to break your heart, break your heart,
Break your heart, break your heart,
Break your heart, break your heart,
Break your heart.
Get ready, get ready, get ready.
'Cause he's the one who's going to break your heart, break your heart,
Break your heart, break your heart.
