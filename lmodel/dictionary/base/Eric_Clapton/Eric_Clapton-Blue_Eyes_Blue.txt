<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="Blue_Eyes_Blue">
I thought that you'd be loving me
I thought you were the one who'd stay forever
But now forever's come and gone
And I'm still here alone
'Cause you were only playing
You were only playing with my heart
I was never waiting, I was never waiting for the tears to start
It was you
Who put the clouds around me
It was you
Who made the tears fall down
It was you
Who broke my heart in pieces
It was you, it was you
Who made my blue eyes blue
Oh, Never should have trusted you
I thought that I'd be all you need
In your eyes I thought I saw my heaven
And now my heavens gone away
And I'm out in the cold
'Cause you had me believing
You had me believing in a lie
Guess I couldn't see it
Guess I couldn't see it till I saw goodbye
It was you
Who put the clouds around me
It was you
Who made the tears fall down
It was you
Who broke my heart in pieces
It was you, it was you
Who made my blue eyes blue
Oh, Never should have trusted you
' Cause you were only playing
You were only playing with my heart
I was never waiting
I was never waiting for the tears to start
It was you
Who put the clouds around me
It was you
It was you
Who put those clouds around me
It was you
Who made the tears fall down
Only you
Who broke my heart in pieces
It was you
It was you
Who made my blue eyes blue
oh, never should have trusted you
oh, never should have trusted you
oh, never should have trusted you
oh, never should have trusted you
