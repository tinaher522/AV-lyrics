<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="Goin'_Away_Baby">
Lord, I'm going away just to wear you off my mind
Lord, I'm going away just to wear you off my mind
Well you keep me worrying 'bout it all the time
Well, I ain't been loved but four womens in my life
Well, I ain't ever loved but four womens in my life
Well, my mother and my sister, sweetheart and my wife
If you don't want me baby, please don't call me 'round
If you don't want me baby, please don't call me 'round
Well, just like you found me, you can put me down
Well now goodbye baby, if you call at home
Well now goodbye baby, if you call at home
You can go away; swear you won't stay long
