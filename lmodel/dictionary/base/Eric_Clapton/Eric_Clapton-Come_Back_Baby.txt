<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="Come_Back_Baby">
Oh come back baby, oh mama please don't go.
Child, the way I love you, well you'll never know, oh.
Come back baby, yeah yeah,
Let's talk it over one more time.
Well I admit, baby, that I was wrong.
Don't you know baby, child you've been gone too long.
Come back baby, yeah yeah,
Let's talk it over one more time.
I said if I could holler like a mountain jack,
I'd go up on the mountain, people, I'd call my baby back, oh.
Come back baby, yeah yeah,
Let's talk it over one more time.
Now one of these days, baby, and it won't be long, yeah.
You're going to look for me child, you know, and I'll be gone.
So come back baby, yeah yeah,
Let's talk it over one more time.
