<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="Alabama_Woman_Blues">
Did you ever go down
On the Mobile and K C line
Did you ever go down
On the Mobile and K C line
I just want to ask you
Did you ever see that gal of mine
I rode the Central
And I hustled the L and N
The Alabama women
They live like section men
Don't cry baby
Your papa will be home some day
I've been away baby
But I did not go to stay
Don't the clouds look lonesome
Across the deep blue sea
Don't my gal look good
When she's coming after me
