<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="Walk_Away">
You leave a trail of tears wherever you go.
One of us will hold you, the other one won't.
But I could never share your love or leave it behind.
Break his heart, not mine.
Do you remember tender moments we shared?
How could this true affection vanish into thin air?
He's not worth the trouble, baby; he's just a waste of your time.
Oh, break his heart, not mine.
Don't you walk away,
You know you're gonna miss me.
Don't you walk away, walk away.
You're gonna miss me,
You're gonna miss my love.
So don't you walk away,
Don't you walk away, walk away.
Don't you walk away, walk away.
So I'll be waiting in the backroom, baby, when you kiss him goodbye.
Oh, break his heart not mine, but...
Don't you walk away,
You know you're gonna miss me.
Don't you walk away, walk away.
You're gonna miss me,
You're gonna miss my love.
Don't you walk away, walk away.
Oh don't you walk away.
I know you're gonna miss my love.
Don't you walk away, walk away.
Don't you walk away.
You're gonna miss my love.
Don't you walk away, walk away.
