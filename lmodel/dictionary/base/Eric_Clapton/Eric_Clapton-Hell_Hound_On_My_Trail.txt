<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="Hell_Hound_On_My_Trail">
Got to keep movin'
Yeah, I got to keep movin'
Blues fallin' down like hail
Blues fallin' down like hail
Blues fallin' down like hail
Blues fallin' down like hail
And the days keeps worryin' me
There's a hellhound on my trail
Hellhound on my trail.
If today was Christmas Eve
If today was Christmas Eve
And tomorrow was Christmas Day
(Aow, wouldn't we have a time, baby?)
If today was Christmas Eve
And tomorrow was Christmas Day
All I need my little street rider for
For to pass the time away
To pass the time away
You sprinkled hot foot powder
All around my door
All around my door
You sprinkled hot foot powder
All around your daddy's door
It keeps me with ramblin' mind, rider
Every old place I go
Every old place I go
I can tell the wind is risin'
Leaves stayin' on the tree
Stayin' on the tree
I can tell the wind is risin'
Leaves stayin' on the tree
All I need my little street rider
But I keep my company
My company.
