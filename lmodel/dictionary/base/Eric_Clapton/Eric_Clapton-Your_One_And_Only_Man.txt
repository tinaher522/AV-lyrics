<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="Your_One_And_Only_Man">
If I could only make you see
That you were only meant for me
Our love will be free
And I'll be your destiny
Your destiny, your destiny
If I can make you understand
Treat me right and love me
And I will be your man
Your one and only man
These are the words
That I have to say
Live by them each and every day
And as the time pass
I know our love will last
Our love will last, our love will last
Take these blues
And understand them
Live by them and love me
And I will be your man
Your one and only man
These are the words
That I have to say
Just live by them each and every day
And as the time will pass
I know our love will last
Our love will last, our love will last
Take these blues
And understand them
Live by them and love me
And honey I will be your man
Your one and only man
I'll be your truly lovin' man
I will be your man
Your one and only man
And I will be your man
