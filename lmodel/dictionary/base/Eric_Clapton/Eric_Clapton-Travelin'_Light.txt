<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="Travelin'_Light">
Travelin' light is the only way to fly
Travelin' light, just you and I
A one way ticket to ecstasy
Away on down, just follow me
Travelin' light is the only way to fly
Travelin' light, now we can catch the wind
Travelin' light, just let your mind pretend
We can go to paradise
Maybe once, maybe twice
Travelin' light is the only way to fly
Travelin' light is the only way to fly
Travelin' light, just you and I
We can go to paradise
Maybe once, maybe twice
Travelin' light is the only way to fly
