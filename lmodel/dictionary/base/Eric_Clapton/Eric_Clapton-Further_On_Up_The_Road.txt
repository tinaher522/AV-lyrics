<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="Further_On_Up_The_Road">
Further on up the road someone's gonna hurt you like you hurt me
Further on up the road someone's gonna hurt you like you hurt me
Further on up the road, baby, just you wait and see
You gotta reap just what you sow; that old saying is true
You gotta reap just what you sow; that old saying is true
Just like you mistreat someone, someone's gonna mistreat you
You been laughing, pretty baby, someday you're gonna be crying
You been laughing, pretty baby, someday you're gonna be crying
Further on up the road you'll find out I wasn't lying
Further on up the road someone's gonna hurt you like you hurt me
Further on up the road someone's gonna hurt you like you hurt me
Further on up the road, baby, just you wait and see
