<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="Terraplane_Blues">
And I feel so lonesome
You hear me when I moan 
When I feel so lonesome
You hear me when I moan 
Who been drivin' my Terraplane now
For you since I been gone 
Hell I'll flash your lights, mama
I'm bound to check your oil
And I'll flash my lights, mama
This horn won't even blow 
There must be a short in this connection
Hoo-well, babe, it's way down below
I'm on'h'ist your hood, mama
I'm bound to check your oil 
I'm on'h'ist your hood, mama
I'm bound to check your oil 
I got a woman that I'm lovin'
Way down in Arkansas
Coils ain't even buzzin'
Little generator won't get the spark 
When the motor's in a bad condition, you need
These batteries charged 
But I'm cryin', please
Plea-hease don't do me wrong 
Who been drivin' my Terraplane now for
You-hoo since I've been gone
Mr. Highway man
Plea-hease don't block the road Mmm mmm
Plea-hease don't block the road 
Cause she's re'ist'rin a cold one hundred
And I'm booked and I got to go
Mmm mmm
Mmm mmm mmm 
Mmm 
You hear me weep and moan 
Who been drivin' my Terraplane now for
You since I been gone
I'm on get down in this connection
Keep tanglin' with this wires 
Get down in this connection
Keep on tanglin' with these wires 
And when I mash down on your little starter
Then your spark plug will give me fire
