<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="Everything_Will_Be_Alright">
Same old hassle every night
All we do is fuss and fight
Ain't no use in talking, might as well start walking
Walking out into the night
You get your gun, I'll get mine
We can do it just one time
If we live no longer, it won't get no stronger
Then we'll know who's really right
All we do is weep and moan
Trying to build ourself a home
Ain't no shame in trying, ain't no use denying
Everything will be alright
