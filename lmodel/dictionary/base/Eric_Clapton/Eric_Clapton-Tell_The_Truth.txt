<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="Tell_The_Truth">
Tell the truth, tell me who's been fooling you?
Tell the truth, who's been fooling who?
There you sit there, looking so cool
While the whole show is passing you by
You better come to terms with your fellow men soon, cause... 
The whole world is shaking now, can't you feel it?
A new dawn is breaking now, can't you see it? 
Tell the truth, tell me who's been fooling you?
Tell the truth, who's been fooling who?
It doesn't matter just who you are
Or where you're going or been
Open your eyes and look into your heart
The whole world is shaking now, can't you feel it?
A new dawn is breaking now, can't you see it?
I said see it, yeah, can't you see it?
Can't you see it, yeah, can't you see it?
I can see it, yeah
Tell the truth, tell me who's been fooling you?
Tell the truth, who's been fooling who?
Hear what I say, 'cause every word is true
You know I wouldn't tell you no lies
Your time's coming, gonna be soon, boy
Tell the truth, tell me who's been fooling you?
Tell the truth, who's been fooling who? 
Tell the truth, tell me who's been fooling you?
Tell the truth, who's been fooling who?
