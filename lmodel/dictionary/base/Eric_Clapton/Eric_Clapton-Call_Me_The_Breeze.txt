<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="Call_Me_The_Breeze">
They call me the breeze
And I keep rollin' down the road
They call me the breeze
As I keep rollin' down the road
I ain't got me nobody
I ain't carrying me no load
Ain't no change in the weather
Ain't no change in me
Ain't no change in the weather
Ain't no change in me
I ain't hidin' from nobody
Ain't nobody's hidin' from me
I got that green light babe
I got to keep moving on
I got that green light babe
And I got to keep moving on
I might go out to California
I might go down to Georgia
I don't know
They call me the breeze
As I keep rollin' down the road
They call me the breeze
As I keep rollin' down the road
I ain't got me nobody
I ain't carrying me no load
