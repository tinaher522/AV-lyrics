<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="Further_On_Down_The_Road">
Further on down the road baby, you will accompany me
Further on down the road baby, you will accompany me
When I think back, your love was like the sun
Don't remember no dark days
Remember the warm warm fun
Further on down the road baby, you will accompany me
Oh if we fools in life oh woman
A happy fool I'd rather be
Oh baby I'll be glad to learn from you,
And darlin' I know you will be glad to learn from me
And if we get down and things get sad
We can cheer up each other
And grin 'cuz things just ain't that bad
If we fools in life, a happy fool I would rather be
Day by day, just one step, one step at a time
'Cuz woman you have given me so much,
Just to ease this stubborn old achin' heart of mine
I don't care where they came from
Don't care what they might say
Woman you've been lovin' in my corner, all of the way
Day by day, a magical kind
'Cuz it's flowin' all of the time
Further on down the road baby, you will accompany me
Further on down the road baby, you will accompany me
When I look back,
Your love was like a sun,
I don't remember any cold days,
Just remember the warm warm fun
Further on down the road, baby
You will accompany me
