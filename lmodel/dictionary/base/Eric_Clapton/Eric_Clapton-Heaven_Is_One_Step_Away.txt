<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="Heaven_Is_One_Step_Away">
We searched all through the night
I couldn't find it, you couldn't find it
I knew something wasn't right
I couldn't find it, you couldn't find it
And they say heaven is one step away
Heaven is one step away
Heaven is one step away
And then there came the dawn:
I couldn't find it, you couldn't find it
I just had to carry on
I couldn't find it, you couldn't find it
And they say heaven is one step away
Heaven is one step away
Heaven is one step away
We didn't leave till a quarter to three
All your friends, they were laughing at me
I don't get it, I don't understand
Who is that man holding your hand?
We searched all through the night
I couldn't find it, you couldn't find it
I knew something wasn't right
I couldn't find it, you couldn't find it
And they say heaven is one step away
Heaven is one step away
Heaven is one step away
Heaven is one step away
Heaven is one step away
Heaven is one step away
Heaven is one step away
