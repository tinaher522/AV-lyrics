<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="I'll_Be_Alright">
I'll be alright
I'll be alright
I'll be alright some day
If in my heart
I do not give
Then I'll be alright some day
I'll overcome
I'll overcome
I'll overcome some day
If in my heart
I do not yield
Then I'll overcome some day
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, someday)
I'm going home
I'm going home
I'm going home some day
If in my heart
I do not yield
Then I'll be coming home some day
Lord, I'll be going home some day
