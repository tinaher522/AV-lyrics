<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="Songbird">
She told me lies, now they were special
I wanted to hear all those lovely words
I heard her one night in a club down in Texas
She called herself the little songbird
Songbird, sing me to sleep and ease my worried mind
Songbird, can you repeat it, say it one more time
Songbird, sing me to sleep and ease my worried mind
Songbird, can you repeat it, say it one more time
She sang it so so sweet, my ears are still ringin'
She didn't mean to deceive me, now that I know
She made it all up, that she was just singin'
And they weren't lies, just part of the show
Songbird, sing me to sleep and ease my worried mind
Songbird, can you repeat it, say it one more time
Songbird, sing me to sleep and ease my worried mind
Songbird, can you repeat it, say it one more time
