<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="Me_And_The_Devil_Blues">
Early this morning
You knocked upon my door
Early this morning
You knocked upon my door
And I said, "Hello, Satan
I believe it's time to go"
Me and the devil
Were walking side by side
Me and the devil
Were walking side by side
I'm gonna beat my woman
Until I get satisfied
She said she don't see why
That I will dog her 'round
Now baby, you know you ain't doing me right
She said she don't see why
That I will dog her 'round
Well, it must be that old evil spirit
So deep down in the ground
You may bury my body
Down by the highway side
I don't care where you bury my body when I'm dead and gone
You may bury my body
Down by the highway side
Ooh, my old evil spirit
Can take a Greyhound bus and ride
