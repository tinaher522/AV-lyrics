<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="Pretty_Blue_Eyes">
Left alone to cry
While he goes out singing,
And she don't see why
A wedding bell ain't ringing.
Left alone to cry
While he goes out rocking,
And she can't see why
It ain't her he's socking.
Goodbye, pretty blue eyes.
Goodbye, pretty blue eyes.
Left alone to cry;
Life don't seem worth living.
I stand to say goodbye,
Done enough forgiving.
Chorus
