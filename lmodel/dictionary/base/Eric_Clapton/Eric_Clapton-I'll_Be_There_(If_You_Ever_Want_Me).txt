<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="I'll_Be_There_(If_You_Ever_Want_Me)">
There ain't no chains strong enough to hold me
Ain't no breeze big enough to slow me
Never have seen a river that's too wide
There ain't no jail tight enough to lock me
Ain't no man big enough to stop me
I'll be there if you ever want me by your side
There ain't no rope stout enough to bind me
Look for me, honey, you will find me
Any old time, get ready with your charm
I'll be there ready and a-waiting
There won't be any hesitating
I'll be there if you ever want me in your arms
Love me, if you're ever gonna love me
I never have seen a road too rough to ride
There ain't no chain strong enough to hold me
Ain't no breeze big enough to slow me
I'll be there if you ever want me by your side
Love me, if you're ever gonna love me
I never have seen a road too rough to ride
There ain't no chain strong enough to hold me
Ain't no breeze big enough to slow me
I'll be there if you ever want me by your side
