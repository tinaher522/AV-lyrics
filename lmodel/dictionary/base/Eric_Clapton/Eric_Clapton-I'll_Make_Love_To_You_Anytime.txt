<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="I'll_Make_Love_To_You_Anytime">
Well I can't read and I can't write
And I don't know my left from right.
I can't tell if the sun's gonna shine
And I don't know if you'll ever be mine,
But I'll make love to you any old time at all.
I can't swim and I can't fly,
I ain't no fish, ain't a bird in the sky.
I can't tell if the sun's gonna shine
And I don't know if you'll ever be mine,
But I'll make love to you any old time at all.
I can't count from one to ten,
And I don't know the shape I'm in.
I can't tell if the sun's gonna shine
And I don't know if you'll ever be mine,
But I'll make love to you any old time at all.
