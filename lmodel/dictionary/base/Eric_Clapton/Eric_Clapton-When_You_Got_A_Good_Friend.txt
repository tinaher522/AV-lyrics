<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="When_You_Got_A_Good_Friend">
When you got a good friend
That will stay right by your side
When you got a good friend
That will stay right by your side
Give her all of your spare time
Love and treat her right
I mistreated my baby
And I can't see no reason why
I mistreated my baby
And I can't see no reason why
Anytime I think about it
I just wring my hands and cry
Wonder could I ever apologize
Or would she sympathize with me
Mmm, would she sympathize with me?
She's a brown-skin woman
Just as sweet as a girlfriend can be
Mmm, baby I may be right or wrong
Baby, it your opinion
Well, I may be right or wrong
Watch your close friend, baby
Then you enemies can't do you no harm
When you got a good friend
That will stay right by your side
When you got a good friend
That will stay right by your side
Give her all of your spare time
Love and treat her right
