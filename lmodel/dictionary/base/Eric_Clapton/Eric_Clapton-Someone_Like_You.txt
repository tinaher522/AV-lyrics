<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="Someone_Like_You">
I got up this morning and fell out of bed
Trying to make it to the door.
The wind was high, I didn't have much time,
Trying to find a man to score.
And then you came up on the other side
To brighten up my day.
I knew right away
That this could be my day.
Someone like you
Could make me change my ways.
Someone like you
Could turn the nights into days.
There you were, standing
On a crowded street.
You looked so good, though the air was bad,
Walking through the fog.
Someone like you
Could make me change my ways.
Someone like you
Could turn the nights into days.
I want to thank you, thank you now
For getting me back on my feet again.
I want to thank you, thank you now
For getting me back on my feet again.
Someone like you
Could make me change my ways.
Someone like you
Could turn the nights into days.
Someone like you
Could make me change my ways.
Someone like you
Could turn the nights into days.
