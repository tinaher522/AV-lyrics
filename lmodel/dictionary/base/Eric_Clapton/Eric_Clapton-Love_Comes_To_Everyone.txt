<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="Love_Comes_To_Everyone">
Go do it
Got to go through that door
There's no easy way out at all...
Still it only takes time
'Til love comes to everyone
For you who it always seems blue
It all, yeah, never rains
But it pours
Still it only takes time...
'Til love comes to everyone
There in your heart...
Something is never changing
Always a part of...
Something is never aging
That's in your heart...
It's so true it can happen to you all; just
Knock and it will open wide
And it only takes time
'Til love comes to everyone
