<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="Driftin'">
I'm drifting and drifting, just like a ship out on the sea
I'm drifting and drifting, just like a ship out on the sea
Well I ain't got nobody in this world to care for me
If my baby would only take me back again
If my baby would only take me back again
I would feel much better, darling, and at least I'd have a friend
I give you all my money, tell me what more can I do
I give you all my money, tell me what more can I do
You is a sweet little girl but I swear you won't be true
I'm drifting and drifting, just like a ship out on the sea
I'm drifting and drifting, just like a ship out on the sea
Because I ain't got nobody in this world to care for me
