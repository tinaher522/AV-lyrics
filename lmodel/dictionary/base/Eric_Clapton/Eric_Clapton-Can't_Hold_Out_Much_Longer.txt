<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="Can't_Hold_Out_Much_Longer">
You know I'm just crazy about you baby,
Wonder, do you ever think of me.
You know I'm crazy about you baby,
But you don't care nothing in the world for me.
Well I can't sleep at night
I just cats nap through the day
I can't hold out much longer
Lord, living this way.
You know I'm just crazy about you baby,
Wonder, do you ever think of me.
You know I'm in love with you darling,
But you don't care nothing in the world for me.
Now there ain't but the one thing momma
That makes your daddy drink.
When you say that you don't love me,
Well lord I begin to think.
You know I'm just crazy about you baby,
Wonder, do you ever think of me.
You know I'm wild about you honey,
But you don't care nothing in the world for me.
