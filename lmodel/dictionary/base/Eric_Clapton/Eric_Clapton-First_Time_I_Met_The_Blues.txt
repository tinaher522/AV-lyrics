<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="First_Time_I_Met_The_Blues">
The first time I met the blues
I was walkin' down through the woods (yeah)
Yes, the first time I met you Mr Blues
I was walkin' down through the woods
As usual it would do me no good
First time I met you Mr Blues
Well, the blues came after me
Don't you know they rode me down through the trees
Well, the blues came after me
Don't you know they rode me down through the trees
You should have seen me begging
Blues, don't murder me (alright)
Morning Mr Blues
Don't you do what you do to me
Yes, yeah, good mornin' Mr Blues
Don't you do what you do to me
You know you'll be with me
Every single mornin', every night and every noon
(Yeah, well I'll tell ya all now)
Good morning Mr Blues
Don't you do what you do to me
Good morning Mr Blues
Don't you just do what you do to me
You know that you'll be with me
Every single mornin', every night and every noon
