<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="Have_You_Ever_Loved_A_Woman">
Have you ever loved a woman so much you tremble in pain?
Have you ever loved a woman so much you tremble in pain?
And all the time you know she bears another man's name.
Have you ever loved a woman so much it's a shame and a sin?
Have you ever loved a woman so much it's a shame and a sin?
And all the time you know she belongs to your very best friend.
Have you ever loved a woman and you know you can't leave her alone?
Have you ever loved a woman and you know you can't leave her alone?
Something deep inside of you won't let you wreck your very best friend's home.
