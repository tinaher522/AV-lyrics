They call it stormy monday, yes but tuesday's just as bad.
They call it stormy monday, yes but tuesday's just as bad.
Wednesday's even worse; thursday's awful sad.
The eagle flies on friday, saturday I go out to play.
The eagle flies on friday, but saturday I go out to play.
Sunday I go to church where I kneel down and pray.
And I say, "lord have mercy, lord have mercy on me.
Lord have mercy, lord have mercy on me.
Just trying to find my baby, won't you please send her on back to me."
The eagle flies on friday, on saturday I go out to play.
The eagle flies on friday, on saturday I go out to play.
Sunday I go to church, where I kneel down, lord and I pray.
Then I say, "lord have mercy, won't you please have mercy on me.
Lord, oh lord have mercy, yeah, won't you please, please have mercy on me.
I'm just a-lookin' for my sweet babe, so won't you please send him home,
Send him on home to me."
