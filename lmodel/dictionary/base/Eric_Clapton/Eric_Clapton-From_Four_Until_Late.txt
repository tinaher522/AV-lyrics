<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="From_Four_Until_Late">
From four until late I was wringing my hands and crying.
From four until late I was wringing my hands and crying.
I believe to my soul that your daddy's gulfport bound.
From four until late, she made me a no good barroom clown.
From four until late, she made me a no good barroom clown.
You know she won't do nothing but tear a good man's reputation down.
A woman is like a dresser, some man always running through it's drawers.
A woman is like a dresser, some man always running through it's drawers.
She cause so many men to wear an apron overall.
When I leave this town I will bid you fare farewell.
When I leave this town I will bid you fare farewell.
And when I return again, you'll have a great long story to tell.
