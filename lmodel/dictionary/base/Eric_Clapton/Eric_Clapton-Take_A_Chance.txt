<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="Take_A_Chance">
If I don't take a chance,
If I don't make a move,
If I don't go looking for new romance,
How will I ever find my groove?
If I don't play around,
How am I gonna have my fun?
If I tried to settle down,
Would I be fooling anyone?
I'm out on a limb above a sea of bliss;
I don't know why I feel this way.
I only know I love it.
And I feel so free today.
You know I feel so free today.
That's right, I feel so free, no matter where I go,
But I feel so free today.
If I don't make mistakes,
If I don't play the fool,
If I have to worry 'bout the heart I break,
How am I ever gonna learn the rules?
I'm looking for danger inside the sweetest smile;
I don't know why I feel this way.
I only know I love it.
If I don't take a chance,
If I don't make a move,
If I don't go looking for new romance,
How will I ever find my groove?
If I don't take a chance,
If I don't make a move,
If I don't go looking for new romance,
How will I ever find my groove?
