<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="When_Somebody_Thinks_You're_Wonderful">
When somebody thinks you're wonderful
What a difference in your day
Seems as though your troubles disappear
Like a feather in your way
When somebody thinks you're wonderful
Tells you with a smile so sweet
What are little stones you step on
Just a meadow 'neath your feet
And how you meet the morning
And gaily swing along
At night you may be weary
But your heart still sings a song
When somebody thinks you're wonderful
Love is mighty close to you
Just another thing more wonderful
Making all her dreams come true
And how you meet the morning
And gaily swing along
At night you may be weary
But your heart still sings a song
When somebody thinks you're wonderful
Love is mighty close to you
Just another thing more wonderful
Making all her dreams come true
