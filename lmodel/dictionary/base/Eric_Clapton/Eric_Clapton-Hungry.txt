<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="Hungry">
Last night as I stepped into the stage lights,
I heard the people cry when they saw my face.
There's nothing like our hearts beating in time.
The crowd may inspire, but you give me my strength.
Oh, hungry, I'm hungry, I'm hungry for your sweet smile.
Lonely, I'm lonely, I'm lonely, I need to hold you for a while.
I've been slipping into desperation;
You're the only salvation that the Lord designed.
Your absence is controlling my defenses.
My life is senseless without you by my side.
Oh, hungry, I'm hungry, I'm hungry for your sweet smile.
Lonely, I'm lonely, I'm lonely, I need to hold you for a while.
Oh, hungry, I'm hungry, I'm hungry for your sweet smile.
Lonely, I'm lonely, I'm lonely, I need to hold you for a while.
Loose ladies on the road will drive you crazy.
Every "no" becomes a "maybe", it never takes too long.
Missing you, I don't know what I'm gonna do.
You don't know what I'm going through; everything seems wrong.
Oh, hungry, I'm hungry, I'm hungry for your sweet smile.
Lonely, I'm lonely, I'm lonely, I need to hold you for a while.
