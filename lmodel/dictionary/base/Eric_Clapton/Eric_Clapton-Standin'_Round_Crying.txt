<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="Standin'_Round_Crying">
Oh baby, look how you got me standin' 'round crying
Oh baby, look how you got me standin' 'round crying
Lord I love you little girl, you're always resting on my mind
Oh baby, I ain't gonna be riding you 'round in my automobile
Oh baby, I ain't gonna be riding you 'round in my automobile
You got so many men, I'm afraid you may get me killed
Oh baby, you ain't nothing like you used to be. (No, don't get me killed, honey!)
Oh baby, you ain't nothing like you used to be. (Oh man, leave that woman alone!)
When I was deep in love with you, little girl
You were just sweet as an apple on a tree
