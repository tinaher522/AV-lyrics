<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="Meet_Me_(Down_At_The_Bottom)">
Put it in your pocket, leave it in your shoe.
Plug it in your socket, flush it down the loo.
Hey baby, show me something new.
Put it in your hat, put it in your can.
Feed it to your cat, share it with your band.
Hey baby, help me understand.
Well they're fighting in the kitchen and they're fighting in the hall.
Up against the dark and up against the wall.
Why don't you meet me in the bottom, baby; bring your running shoes.
