<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="Since_You_Said_Goodbye">
Rain keeps fallin' on my head
Sun keeps burnin' out my eyes
Lord, the moon he knows I'm blue
And it's all because of you
Ever since you said goodbye
Black cloud hangin' over me
I just can't seem to do it right
Lord, the wind it never blows
The river never flows
Ever since you said goodbye
Sunny days have come and gone
Heaven knows I'm here cryin'
Lord, the moon he knows I'm blue
All because of you
Ever since you said goodbye
