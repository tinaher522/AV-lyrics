<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="Can't_Let_You_Do_It">
Well, you got some high class, baby 
Steppin' all over me 
Your high tone and your blue line 
Respectability 
You go down on the corner 
Having yourself a ball
Changed your way of living
And I don't know you at all
I can't let you do it
I can't let you do it to me
I know you're gonna do it
But I can't let you do it to me
If the sun don't shine no more
And the blue sky don't appear
If the rainfall don't fall no more
I really don't think you'd care
You got so wrapped up, baby
In everything you do
Been putting on the dog, you know
And I mean you
I can't let you do it
I can't let you do it to me
I know you're gonna do it
But I can't let you do it to me
If you don't shut down, Miss Banquet
If you don't shut down real soon
Gonna find yourself out on the street
Looking for another room
You've seen me on the corner
Having myself a ball
Gonna change my way of living
And you won't know me at all
I can't let you do it
I can't let you do it to me
I know you're gonna do it
But I can't let you do it to me
