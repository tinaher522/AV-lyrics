<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="Mean_Old_Frisco">
Well that mean old dirty Frisco and that low down Santa Fe.
Mean old Frisco and that low down Santa Fe.
You know they take my girl away, Lord, and blow back out on me.
Well my mama, she done told me, and my papa told me too.
Mama told me and my papa told me too.
A woman that gets in your face, Lord she ain't no friend for you.
Well I'm goin' away now baby, and I won't be back until fall.
Goin' away, baby.  Lord, I won't be back till fall.
If I don't come back by then, Lord, I won't be back at all.
Well that mean old dirty Frisco and that low down Santa Fe.
Mean old Frisco and that low down Santa Fe.
Gonna take my gal away, Lord, and blow back out on me.
