<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="The_Shape_You're_In">
I took my baby to see a show
She was telling me she didn't want to go
I said, "Come on girl, what's the matter with you?"
But I could tell by the smell that she'd had a few
I said hold on girl don't get too tight
You started early and we've got all night
You've got to take it easy, take it slow
We don't want the whole world to know
About the shape you're in
Well, my little girl really loves that wine
Wine will do it to her most everytime
If it's red or it's white or it's in between
She can drink more wine than I've ever seen
I said hold on girl don't get too tight
You started early and we've got all night
You've got to take it easy, take it slow
We don't want the whole world to know
About the shape you're in
Now I'm not trying to get heavy with you
I'll mind my own business if you want me to
But I love you girl, I don't love no one else
I'm just telling you baby 'cause I've been there myself
I said hold on girl don't get too tight
You started early and we've got all night
You've got to take it easy, take it slow
We don't want the whole world to know
About the shape you're in
