<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="Every_Little_Thing">
Well it's a cloudy morning, but I got the sun in my life
I wanna feel what forever feels like, with you by my side
People try to sell you freedom, but they've never been held by your love
Every little thing, every little thing, your love is all I see
Every little thing, every little thing, you make me feel complete
All the little things, all the little things, can wait until tomorrow
Every little thing, every little thing, love is all I need
And I get lost in my head sometimes
And I go somewhere else instead
When all you want to do is love me
You can wait so patiently
Hold me closer just by looking
And I fall in love all over again
Every little thing, every little thing, love is all I see
Every little thing, every little thing, you make me feel complete
All the little things, all the little things, they can wait until tomorrow
Every little thing, every little thing, your love is all I need
Give me a piece of your heart, give me a piece of your heart
Give me a piece of your heart, I give you a piece of my heart
Every little thing, every little thing, your love is all I see
Every little thing, every little thing, you can make me feel complete
All the little things, all the little things, they can wait until tomorrow
Every little thing, every little thing
I wanna hear my children sing
Every little thing you do is beautiful
Open your heart and let the love come in
Every little thing you do is beautiful
Open your heart and let the love come in
Every little thing you do is beautiful
Open your heart and let the love come in
Every little thing you do is beautiful
Open your heart and let the love come in
Open your heart and let your love come in
Every little thing you do is beautiful
Open your heart and let the love come in
Open your heart and let your love come in
