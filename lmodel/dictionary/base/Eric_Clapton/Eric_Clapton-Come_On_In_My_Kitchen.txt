<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="Come_On_In_My_Kitchen">
Mmm... you better come on in my kitchen babe, it's goin' to be rainin' outdoors
The woman I love, took from my best friend
Some joker got lucky, stole her back again
You better come on in my kitchen babe, it's goin' to be rainin' outdoors
Oh, she's gone, I know she won't come back
I've taken the last nickel out of her nation sack
You better come on in my kitchen, baby, it's goin' to be rainin' outdoors
[Spoken:] Oh, can't you hear that wind howl?
Can't you hear that wind howl?
You better come on in my kitchen, baby, it's goin' to be rainin' outdoors
When a woman gets in trouble, everybody throws her down
Lookin' for her good friend, none can't be found
You better come on in my kitchen, baby, it's goin' to be rainin' outdoors
Winter time's comin', it's goin' to be slow
You can make the winter, babe, that's dry long so
You better come on in my kitchen, 'cause it's goin' to be rainin' outdoors
