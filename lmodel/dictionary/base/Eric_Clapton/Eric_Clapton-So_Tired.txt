<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="So_Tired">
Get up in the morning already yawning and I'm so tired
I Ain't had a wink of sleep seems like all week
We're So tired
The Baby's only feeding and one of them is teething
They're So tired
They get up before the dawn I don't know how we carry on
We're so tired
Thank God their mama is a natural
She knows exactly what to do
And as for me I think I'd go insane
I just wouldn't have a clue
You know we try to do our best
Just don't get no rest
We're so tired
Would do it all again you can bet your life my friend
But I'm So tired
Bomp ba da da da da da
We're So tired So Tired
Bomp ba da da da da da 
So tired So tired
Just can't wait til the sun goes down and all the kids have gone to bed
Trying to sleep you know but sleep won't come
With all the stuff goin through my head
Well its play group on thursday Music class on Friday, I'm so tired
And Now Mamas getting snappy
Daddy won't change no NAPPY*  
And I'm so tired
Bomp ba da da da da da 
So tired
Bomp ba da da da da da 
So tired
Sometime I think I'll just go on to bed
I must have better things to do
When Its time to get my good night kiss
My dreams have all come true
Bomp ba da da da da da
So Tired
Bomp ba da da da da da
So Tired
So Tired So Tired
So Tired So tired
So tired So tired
So tired So Tired
