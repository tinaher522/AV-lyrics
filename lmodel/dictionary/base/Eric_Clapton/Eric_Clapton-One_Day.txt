<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="One_Day">
One day
I believe
One day
I can see
Baby
Out in the country, maybe down by the sea
Will I wake up one morning and find that I've been set free
One day
One day
Some day
I can't say how
Some day
But I don't know now
Maybe tomorrow when I'm old and gray
What I ever wanted will finally come my way
One day
One day
One day
This dream will come true
One day
Maybe you will too
Maybe flying high, maybe close to the ground
I will hear your voice and I'll know I've been found
Hold me tight, baby make me stay
I can hear every word you've been trying to say
One day
One day
