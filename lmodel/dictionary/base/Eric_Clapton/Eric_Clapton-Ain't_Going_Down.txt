<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="Ain't_Going_Down">
It ain't no big deal
We're all lucky to be alive
I myself don't believe in luck
Or taking chances, I will survive
Every move I make
Every twist every turn
You scandalize and humble me
I may be slow but I will learn
'Cause I ain't going down anymore
No, I ain't going down anymore
No, I ain't going down anymore
No, I ain't going down anymore
If I had my way
I would probably just sit and stare
Watch the TV or read a book
I'd have no reason to be aware
But I ain't got time
I just could not live that way
I've got to step outside myself
I've still got something left to say
And I ain't going down anymore
No, I ain't going down anymore
No, I ain't going down anymore
No, I ain't going down anymore
'Cause I ain't going down anymore
No, I ain't going down anymore
No, I ain't going down anymore
No, I ain't going down anymore
Channelled in my groove
Part of another space and time
Please allow me to introduce 
Another very good friend of mine
Some call him fear
Some call him righteousness
I myself ain't clear
And you can't force me to make a guess
