<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="If_I_Had_Possession_Over_Judgement_Day">
If I had possession
Over judgement day
If I had possession
Over judgement day
Lord, the women I'm lovin' wouldn't
Have no right to pray
And I went to the mountain
Far as my eyes could see
Lord, I went to the mountain
Far as my eyes could see
Some other man got my woman and
The lonesome blues got me
And I rolled and I tumbled
Cried the whole night long
Lord, I rolled and I tumbled
Cried the whole night long
And I woke up this mornin'
My biscuit roller gone
Had to fold my armes and
Slowly walked away
(I didn't like the way she done.)
Lord, I fold my armes and I
Slowly walked away
Well, I said in my mind, "Yo'
Trouble gon' come someday"
Well, now run here, baby
Get down on bended knee
Lord, now run here, baby
Get down on bended knee
I wanna tell you all about, Lord
The way they treated me
