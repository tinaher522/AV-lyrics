<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="Beautiful_Thing">
I've told you once, now you should know
The reason that I'm coming down.
There ain't no time to repeat again;
Just need to bring it around.
We had a beautiful thing going,
You couldn't see things my way.
We had a beautiful thing going,
Something just got in our way.
And I told you once that it was rough.
I looked on you as my friend,
Because that did not seem to be good enough,
And now it's time to begin.
We've got a beautiful thing going,
I hope that's the way it will stay.
We've got a beautiful thing going,
Nothing can stand in our way.
Fourth Verse
