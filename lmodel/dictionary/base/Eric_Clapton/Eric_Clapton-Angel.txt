<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="Angel">
All up and down the boulevard
All the boys are looking hard
Trying to score, trying to make a pass
Anything at all, don't have to last
Angel, she's a friend of mine
She don't know about street time
She don't know how to hurt you deep
But we play for keeps
Cut you like a knife
Angel, will you survive?
Cut you like a knife
Angel, street life
Pool hall hangers and card sharks
Hustlers and lovers come after dark
They all know it's a fact
Angel, better stand back
Sun goes down
Street comes alive
Here come the boys with all their jive
Any woman can be theirs they don't really care
They cut you like a knife
Angel, will you survive?
Cut you like a knife,
Angel, street life
All up and down the boulevard
All the boys are looking hard
Trying to score, trying to make a pass
Anything at all
Cut you like a knife
Angel, will you survive?
Cut you like a knife
Angel, street life
Cut you like a knife
Angel, will you survive?
Cut you like a knife
Angel, street life
Cut you like a knife
Angel, will you survive?
Cut you like a knife
Angel, street life
