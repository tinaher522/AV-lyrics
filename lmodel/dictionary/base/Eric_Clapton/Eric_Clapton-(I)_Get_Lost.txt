<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="(I)_Get_Lost">
I'm sorry
Why should I say, I'm sorry?
If I hurt you
You know you've hurt me too
But you get lost inside your tears
And there is nothing I can do
'Cause I get lost inside my fear
That I am nothing without you
You're angry
Why shouldn't you be angry?
With what we've been through
Well, I get angry too
But you get lost inside your tears
And there is nothing I can do
'Cause I get lost inside my fear
That I am nothing without you
That I am nothing without you
Why should we have taken so long
To be looking inside of our mind?
Everything we tried went wrong
Are we worried 'bout what we might find?
I'm sorry
But can I say, I'm sorry?
If I hurt you
You know it hurts me too
But you get lost inside your tears
And there is nothing I can do
'Cause I get lost inside my fear
That I am nothing without you
And you get lost inside your tears
And there is nothing we can do
'Cause I get lost inside my fear
That I am nothing without you
That I am nothing without you
Feel like I'm nothing without you
And I am nothing without you
Like I am nothing without you
