<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="Too_Bad">
It's too bad I don't love you, for you have worried me night and day.
It's too bad I don't love you, for you have worried me night and day.
Till my heart begins to stammer and my hair is turning gray.
It's too bad I don't need you, because we get along so good.
It's too bad I don't need you, because we get along so good.
You must be thinking, 'bout this time, that my poor heart is made of wood.
It's too bad I don't miss you, 'cause you are always on my mind.
It's too bad I don't miss you, 'cause you are always on my mind.
I want to stay around your circle and learn to love you all the time.
