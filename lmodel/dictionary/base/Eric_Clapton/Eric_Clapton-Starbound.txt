<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="Starbound">
When you and I are ready
No longer earthly-bound
We'll travel through the crystal night, starbound
Heaven holds a mystery, wrapped inside a sound
Through the eyes of time, starbound, you and I
A floating star is what we are
Suspended in space
Outward-bound it's the only home we've found
To save the human race
Speed is now their captain, kings that lost their crown
Motion is our master
Starbound
Starbound
Starbound
