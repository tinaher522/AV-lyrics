<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="Black_Summer_Rain">
Where is the sun,
The sun that used to shine on me?
Where has it gone
Or is it just a memory?
I looked through the window,
Staring at the sky,
Waiting for a moment
That always passed me by.
Black summer rain,
Black summer rain,
Black summer rain is falling on me, girl.
Where is the love,
The love I need to set me free?
And how can I escape
This gloom that is swallowing me?
Black summer rain,
Black summer rain,
Black summer rain is falling on me, girl.
Black summer rain,
Black summer rain,
Black summer rain is falling on me, girl.
