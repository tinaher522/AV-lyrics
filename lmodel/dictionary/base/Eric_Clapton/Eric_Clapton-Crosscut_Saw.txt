<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="Crosscut_Saw">
I'm a crosscut saw, baby drag me across your log
I'm a crosscut saw, baby drag me across your log
I'll cut your wood so easy for you, you can't help but say "hot dog"
Some call me wood-cutting Sam, some call me woodcutting Jim
Last girl I cut wood for, she want me back again
I'm a crosscut saw, baby drag me across your log
I'll cut your wood so easy for you, you can't help but say "hot dog"
(All right!)
I got a dull-blade axe, that really cuts good
And I'm a crosscut saw, bury me in your wood
I'm a crosscut saw, baby drag me across your log
I'll cut your wood so easy for you, you can't help but say "hot dog"
