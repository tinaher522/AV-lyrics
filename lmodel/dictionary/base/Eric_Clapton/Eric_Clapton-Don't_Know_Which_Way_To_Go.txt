<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="Don't_Know_Which_Way_To_Go">
I think I'm leaving in the morning,
All your crying won't help you now.
I think I'm leaving in the morning baby, yeah,
All your crying won't help you now.
But the whole time I was with you baby,
Everybody, everybody knowed you weren't no good no how.
Yes it was a long time coming baby,
But you, but you finally made it home.
Yes it was a long time coming baby, yeah,
Oh but you finally made it home.
Yes I want you to realize now baby, yeah,
Darling you know you done me wrong.
You built my hopes so high,
Honey, you let me down so low.
Oh you built, you built my hopes so high baby, yeah,
Oh woman, you let me, you let me down so low.
Yes you got me walking 'round here in circles baby,
Oh I don't know which way to go.
Oh just one more time babe,
Just let me, let me prove my love to you.
Yes just one more, one more time baby, yeah,
Why don't you let me, let me prove my love to you.
I want to do all the little things baby,
All the little things I will you ask to do.
