<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="Train_To_Nowhere">
You can catch it if you want to ride
Don't you worry if it pass you by
You can catch it if you want to ride
Don't you worry if it pass you by
Lord you know the reason why
On this train till I die
Train I ride goes to God knows where
I don't know and I don't care
Train I ride goes to God knows where
I don't know and I don't care
If you ain't got money don't despair
'Cause you don't have to pay no fare
Please now brother don't you ride this train
Ride the wrong rails, live your life in vain
Please now brother don't you ride this train
Ride the wrong rails, live your life in vain
