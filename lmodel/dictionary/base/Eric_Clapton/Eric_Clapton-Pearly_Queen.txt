<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="Pearly_Queen">
I had a strange dream from a pearly queen,
And she could drink more wine than I've ever seen.
She had some gypsy's blood flowing through her feet,
And when the time was right she said that I would meet
My destiny.
I traveled 'round the world to find the sun.
I couldn't stop myself from having fun,
But when the time was right, the flowers grew
But they were made of silk and sequins, two by two.
I traveled 'round the world to find the sun.
I couldn't stop myself from having fun.
But when the time was right, the flowers grew
But they were made of silk and sequins, I would meet
My destiny.
