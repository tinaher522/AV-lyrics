<song artist="Eric_Clapton" title="Something_Special">
She's something special, I can't explain it,
But when she's near me, I can't contain it.
And just one look at her face is good enough for me.
No way of knowing which way I'm going,
But I can't stop it, it keeps on growing.
And just one look at her face is good enough for me.
She ain't too pretty, she ain't too tall,
In fact she ain't too much of anything at all.
I don't care what the people say,
They're going to find out some sweet day.
She is precious, she is charming,
She is so innocent it's really disarming.
And just one look at her face is good enough for me.
She's something special, I can't explain it,
But when she's near me, I can't contain it.
And just one look at her face is good enough for me.
She ain't too pretty, she ain't too tall,
In fact she ain't too much of anything at all.
I don't care what the people say,
They're going to find out some sweet day.
Is good enough for me,
Is good enough for me.
