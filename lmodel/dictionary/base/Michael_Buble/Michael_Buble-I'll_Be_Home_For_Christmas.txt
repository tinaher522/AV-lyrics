<song artist="Michael_Buble" title="I'll_Be_Home_For_Christmas">
I'm dreaming tonight of a place I love
Even more than I usually do
And although I know it's a long road back
I promise you
I'll be home for Christmas
You can count on me
Please have snow and mistletoe
And presents by the tree
Christmas eve will find you
Where the love light gleams
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams
I'll be home for Christmas
You can count on me
Please have some snow and mistletoe
And presents by the tree
Christmas eve will find me
Where the love light gleams
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams
If only in my dreams
