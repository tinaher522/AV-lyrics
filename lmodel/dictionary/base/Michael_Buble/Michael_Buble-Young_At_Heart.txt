<song artist="Michael_Buble" title="Young_At_Heart">
Fairytales can come true
That can happen to you
When you're young at heart
For it's hard you will find
To be narrow of mind
When you're young at heart
You can go to extremes
With impossible schemes
You can laugh when your dreams 
Fall apart at the seams
And life get's more exciting with each passing day
And love is either in your heart
Or on its way
Don't you know
That it's worth
Every treasure on earth
To be young at heart
For as which as you are
It's much better by far to be young at heart
And if you should survive till 105
Look at all you'll derive out of being alive
And here is the best part
You have a head start
If you are among of very young at heart
And if you should survive to 105
Look at all you'll derive out of being alive
And here is the best part
You have a head start
If you are among of very young at heart
