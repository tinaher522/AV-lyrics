<song artist="Michael_Buble" title="Half_A_Moment">
Michael Buble:
Half a moment
We are together
I shall want no-one else
And nothing new.
Half a moment
I shall treasure,
Keep it locked away
For some future rainy day.
Should you leave me
With just this moment
In my mind
I shall capture it anew,
Like some picture
Taken in my childhood
Half a moment
Spent with you.
Jose Carreras: 
Countless vivid memories
Spin before my view,
Like some toy kaleidoscope
Images of you.
Time looks kindly
On fleeting lovers
They can turn the briefest hour
Into a day
Turn a moment
To a lifetime
Making it to last
Blending future with the past.
Michael Buble:
We're together,
What else can matter?
Jose Carreras:
Even though
Half a moment is too few
Michael Buble:
I shall save it
'Til I have another
Jose Carreras:
Making one whole moment
Both:
Filled with you!
