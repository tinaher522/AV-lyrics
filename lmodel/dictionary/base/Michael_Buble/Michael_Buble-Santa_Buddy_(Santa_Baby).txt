Santa baby, slip a Rolex under the tree, for me.
I've been an awful good guy,
Santa buddy, and hurry down the chimney tonight.
Santa buddy, a 65 convertible too, still blue.
I'll wait up for you dude,
Santa buddy, and hurry down the chimney tonight.
Think of all the fun I've missed,
I think of all the hotties that I haven't kissed,
Next year I could be just so good,
If you'd check off my Christmas list,
Santa pally, I wanna yacht and really that's not a lot,
I've been an sweetie all year,
Santa buddy, and hurry down the chimney tonight.
Santa buddy, one thing that I really do need, the deed,
To a platinum mine,
Santa pally, so hurry down the chimney tonight.
Santa buddy, fill my stocking with connex tips, for kicks.
Through me under first line,
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight.
Come and trim my Christmas tree,
With some decorations bought at Mercedes,
I really I do believe in you,
Now let's see if you believe in me
Santa puppy, forgot to mention one little thing, cha-ching,
No I don't mean as alone.
Santa buddy, so hurry down the chimney tonight,
Hurry down the chimney tonight,
Oh hurry down the chimney tonight.
