<song artist="Michael_Buble" title="I'm_Beginning_To_See_The_Light">
I never cared much for moonlit skies
I never winked back at fireflies
But now that the stars are in your eyes
I'm beginning to see the light
I never went in for afterglow
Or candle light on the mistletoe
But now when you turn the lamp down low
I'm beginning to see the light
I used to ramble through the park
Shadow boxing in the dark
Then you came and caused a spark
That's a four-alarm fire now
I never made love by lantern shine
I never saw rainbows in my wine
But now that your lips are burning mine
I'm beginning to see the light
I never went in for afterglow
Or candle light on the mistletoe
But when you turn the lamp down low
I'm beginning to see the light
I used to ramble through the park
Shadow boxing in the dark
Then you came and caused a spark
That's a four-alarm fire now
I never made love by lantern shine
I never saw rainbows in my wine
But now that your lips are burning mine
I'm beginning to see the light
I used to ramble through the park
Shadow boxing in the dark
Then you came and caused a spark
That's a four-alarm fire now
I never made love by lantern shine
I never saw rainbows in my wine
But now that your lips are burning mine
I'm beginning, oh, I'm beginning
I'm beginning to see the light, ooh, that light
I'm beginning to see the light
