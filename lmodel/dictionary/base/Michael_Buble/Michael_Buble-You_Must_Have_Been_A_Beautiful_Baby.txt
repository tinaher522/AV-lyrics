<song artist="Michael_Buble" title="You_Must_Have_Been_A_Beautiful_Baby">
You must have been a beautiful baby
You must have been a wonderful child
When you were only starting to go to kindergarten
I bet you drove those other childs wild.
And when it came to winning blue ribbons
I bet you taught those other kids how.
I can see the judges' eyes when they handed you the prize
You had the cutest bow.
You must've been a beautiful baby
Cause baby look at you now.
