<song artist="Michael_Buble" title="When_You're_Smiling">
When you're smilin'
When you're smilin'
The whole world smiles with you.
And when you're laughin'
When you're laughin'
The sun comes shinin' through.
When you're cryin',
You bring on the rain,
So, stop you're sighin',
Won't you be happy again!
When you're smiling,
Keep on smilin'
And the whole world smiles with you.
