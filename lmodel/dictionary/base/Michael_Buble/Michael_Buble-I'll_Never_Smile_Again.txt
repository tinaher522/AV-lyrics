<song artist="Michael_Buble" title="I'll_Never_Smile_Again">
I'll never smile again
Until I smile at you
I'll never laugh again
What good would it do
For tears would fill my eyes
My heart would realize
That our romance is through
I'll never love again
I'm so in love with you
I'll never thrill again
To somebody new
Within my heart 
I know I will never start
To smile again
Until I smile at you
