<song artist="Michael_Buble" title="Holly_Jolly_Christmas">
Have a holly, jolly Christmas
It's the best time of the year
I don't know if there'll be snow,
But have a cup of cheer.
Have a holly, jolly Christmas
And when you walk down the street
Say Hello to friends you know
And everyone you meet.
Oh, ho, the mistletoe
Hung where you can see
Somebody waits for you
Kiss her once for me.
Have a holly jolly Christmas,
And in case you didn't hear,
Oh by golly, have a holly,
Jolly Christmas this year.
