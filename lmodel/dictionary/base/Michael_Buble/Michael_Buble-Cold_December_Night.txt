<song artist="Michael_Buble" title="Cold_December_Night">
Stockings are hung with care
Children s sleep with one eye open
Now there's more than toys at stake
Cause I'm older now but not done hoping.
The twinkling after lights
A Santa kid who's filled with hustle
Old saint nick has taken flight
With a hop on board so please be careful.
Each year I ask for many different things
But now I know what my heart wants you to bring
So please just fall in love with me this Christmas
There's nothing else that I would need this Christmas
Won't be wrapped under the tree I want something that lasts forever
So kiss me on this cold December night.
A cheer that smells of pine
A house that's filled with joy and laughter
The mistletoe says stand in line
Loneliness is what I've captured
Oh but this evening can be a holy night
Lets cozy on up our fireplace
And dim those Christmas lights
So please just fall in love with me this Christmas
There's nothing else that you would need this Christmas
Won't be wrapped under the tree want something that lasts forever
So kiss me on this cold December night.
They call it the season of giving
I'm here, your stroll of taking
They call it the season of giving I'm here, I'm yours
Just fall in love with me this Christmas
There's nothing else that we would need this Christmas
Won't be wrapped under the tree want something that lasts forever
Cause I don't wanna be alone tonight
I'm wearin' our Christmas sweater
While talking to the mistletoe tonight
I want something that lasts forever
So kiss me on this cold December night.
They call it the season of giving
I'm here, your stroll of taking
They call it the season of giving I'm here, I'm yours
