<song artist="Michael_Buble" title="Spider-Man_Theme">
Spider-Man, Spider-Man,
Does whatever a spider can
Spins a web, any size,
Catches thieves just like flies
Look Out!
Here comes the Spider-Man.
Is he strong?
Listen bud,
He's got radioactive blood.
Can he swing from a thread?
Take a look overhead
Hey, there
There goes the Spider-Man.
In the chill of night
At the scene of a crime
Like a streak of light
He arrives just in time.
Spider-Man, Spider-Man
Friendly neighborhood Spider-Man
Wealth and fame
He's ignored
Action is his reward
Look Out!
Here comes the Spider-Man.
Watch out Mr. Hotshot!
In the chill of night
At the scene of a crime
Like a streak of light
He arrives just in time.
Spider-Man, Spider-Man
Friendly neighborhood Spider-Man
Wealth and fame
He's ignored
Action is his reward
To him, life is a great big bang up
Whenever there's a hang up
You'll find the Spider man.
