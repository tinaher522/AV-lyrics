<song artist="Michael_Buble" title="Beyond_The_Sea">
Somewhere, beyond the sea
somewhere, waiting for me
my lover stands on golden sand
and watches the ships
that go sailing
Somewhere, beyond the sea
she's there, watching for me
if I could fly like birds on high
then straight to her heart
I'll go sailing
It's far, beyond the stars
It's near beyond the moon

and oh, beyond a doubt
my heart will lead me there soon
we'll meet, beyond the shore
we'll kiss just like before
happy we'll be beyond the sea
and ever again, I'll go sailin'
And oh, beyond a doubt
my heart will lead me there soon
oh we'll meet and oh we'll meet beyond the shore
we'll kiss just as before
happy we-will be beyond the sea
and ever again, I'll go sailin'
