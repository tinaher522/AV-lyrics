Meglio stasera
Baby go, go, go
Or as we natives say, "Fa subito!"
If you're ever gonna kiss me
It had better be tonight
While the mandolins are playing
And stars are bright
Mmmm
If you've anything to tell me
It had better be tonight
Or somebody else may tell me
And whisper the words just right
Meglio stasera
Baby go, go, go
Or as we natives say, "Fa subito!"
If you're ever gonna hold me
It had better be tonight
Or somebody else may hold me
They might make me feel just right
Meglio stasera
Baby go, go, go
Or as we natives say, "Fa subito!"
For this poor Americano
Who knows little of your speech
Be a nice Italiano
And start to teach
Mmmm
(Go Ahead!)
Show me how in old Milano
Lovers hold each other, oh so tight
But I warn you, sweet paesano
But it had better be tonight
Meglio stasera
Baby go, go, go
Or as we natives say, "Fa subito!"
