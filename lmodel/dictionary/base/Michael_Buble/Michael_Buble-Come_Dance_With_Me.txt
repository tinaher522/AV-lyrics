<song artist="Michael_Buble" title="Come_Dance_With_Me">
Hear that, cutes?
Put on your dancing boots 
And come dance with me!
Come dance with me, 
What evening for some terpsichore!
Pretty face, I know a swinging place
Come on, dance with me!
Romance with me on a crowded floor!
And while the rhythm swings,
What lovely thing I'll be saying!
And what is dancing
But making love, set the music!
When the band begins to leave the stand
And folks start to roam,
As we walk home, cheek to cheek we'll be
So come on, come on, come on, 
Come on and dance with me!
Hear that, sweets, 
Throw on those Latin... 
And come dance with me!
What I mean is, come on and my
Let's cha-cha-cha!
And leave your sweat and do the bango bet
Come on, dance with me!
Romance with me uh, la, la
I don't care what it has,
Cause that jargon jazz makes me move it!
And we charade 
When the band starts to groove it, 
They groove it!
Come on by, cause we're set to fly
And I'll let you lead
If that's agreed, you'll know where I'll be!
So come on, come on, come on
Come and dance with me!
I'll do the cha-cha-cha, uh, the merengue
We'll grow the tango
Come on and dance with me!
