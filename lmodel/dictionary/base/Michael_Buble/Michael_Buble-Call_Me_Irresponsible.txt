<song artist="Michael_Buble" title="Call_Me_Irresponsible">
Call me irresponsible
Call me unreliable
Throw in undependable too
Do my foolish alibis bore you
Well I'm not too clever
I just adore you
Call me unpredictable
Tell me I'm impractical
Rainbows I'm inclined to pursue
Call me irresponsible
Yes I'm unreliable
But it's undeniable true
I'm irresponsibly mad for you
Do my foolish alibis bore you
Well I'm not too clever
I just adore you
Call me unpredictable
Tell me that I'm so impractical
Rainbows I'm inclined to pursue
Go ahead, call me irresponsible
Yes I'm unreliable
But it's undeniably true
I'm irresponsibly mad for you
