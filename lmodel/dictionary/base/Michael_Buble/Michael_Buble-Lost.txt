<song artist="Michael_Buble" title="Lost">
Can't believe it's over
I watched the whole thing fall
And I never saw the writing that was on the wall
If I'd only knew
The days were slipping past
That the good things would never last
That you were crying
Mmm, summer turned to winter
And the snow had turned to rain
And the rain turned into tears upon your face
I hardly recognized the girl you are today
And God, I hope it's not too late
Mmm, it's not too late
CHORUS:
'Cause you are not alone
I'm always there with you
And we'll get lost together
Till the light comes pouring through
'Cause when you feel like you're done
And the darkness has won
Babe, you're not lost
When your world's crashing down
And you can't bear the thought
I said, "Babe, you're not lost"
Life can show no mercy, it
It can tear your soul apart
It can make you feel like you've gone crazy
But you're not
And things have seem to changed
There's one thing that's still the same
In my heart, you have remained
And we can fly, fly, fly away
CHORUS:
'Cause you are not alone
And I am there with you
And we'll get lost together
Till the light comes pouring through
'Cause when you feel like you're done
And the darkness has won
Babe, you're not lost
When the world's crashing down
And you cannot bear the cross
I said, "Baby, you're not lost"
Mmm, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I said, "Baby, you're not lost"
I said, "Baby, you're not lost"
Ooh, yeah, yeah
I said, "Baby, you're not lost"
