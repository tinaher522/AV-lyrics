<song artist="Michael_Buble" title="One_Step_At_A_Time">
one step at a time
That's how it's gotta be from now on
And the reason or rhyme
for packing up or carrying on
Inch by inch is a cinch
Yard by yard is much harder
Life without you baby is
Harder
Life without you baby is hard
Is the moon going to shine?
The moon's a piece of cake this time
One step out of line
Across my fingers it's a lucky sign
Inch by inch is a cinch
Yard by yard is much harder
Life without you baby is
Harder
Life without you baby is hard

You know the whole affair can be
Simply
Settled right from the start
if we both see
there's no chance if we dance in the dark
lose our way and we can't find a spark
take one step any time 
it's easy 
ready get set off your mark
One step at a time
Ain't committing a crime
or parking where I don't belong.
Inch by inch is a cinch
and yard by yard is much harder
Life without you baby is
Harder
Life without you baby is hard
Inch by inch is a cinch
and yard by yard is much harder
Life without you baby is
Harder
Life without you baby is hard
You know the whole affair could be
Simply
Settled right from the start
if we both see
there's no chance if we dance in the dark
lose our way and we can't find a spark
take one step any time 
it's easy 
ready get set off your mark

one step at a time
That's how it's gotta be from now on
Ain't committing a crime
or parking where I don't belong.
Inch by inch is a cinch
Yard by yard is much harder
Life without you baby is
Harder
Life without you baby is harder
Life without you baby is hard
