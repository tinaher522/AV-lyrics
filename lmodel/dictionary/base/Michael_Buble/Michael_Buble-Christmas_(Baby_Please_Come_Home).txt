<song artist="Michael_Buble" title="Christmas_(Baby_Please_Come_Home)">
(Christmas)
The snow's coming down
(Christmas)
I'm watching it fall
(Christmas)
Lots of people around
(Christmas)
Baby please come home
(Christmas)
The church bells in town
(Christmas)
All ringing in song
(Christmas)
Full of happy sounds
(Christmas)
Baby please come home
They're singing "Deck The Halls"
But it's not like Christmas at all
I remember when you were here
And all the fun we had last year
(Christmas)
Pretty lights on the tree
(Christmas)
I'm watching them shine
(Christmas)
You should be here with me
(Christmas)
Baby please come home
They're singing "Deck The Halls"
But it's not like Christmas at all
I remember when you were here
And all the fun we had last year
(Christmas)
If there was a way
(Christmas)
I'd hold back this tears
(Christmas)
But it's Christmas day
(Please)
Please
(Please)
Please
(Please)
Please
(Please)
Please
(Please)
Please
(Please)
Please
Oh comin' home
Oh babe
You know I need you
Oh comin' home
I gotta have you
You know I need you
(Love, love, love, love)
I gotta have you
I said nanananana...
It's Christmas, Christmas, Christmas... yeah
