<song artist="Michael_Buble" title="Have_I_Told_You_Lately_That_I_Love_You">
Have I told you lately that I love you
Then I tell you once again, somehow
Have I told with all my heart, and soul
How I adore you
Well darling, I'm telling you now
Have I told you lately, when I'm sleeping
Every dream I dream is you somehow
Have you I told you why I've ... a long when you're not with me
Well darling, I'm telling you now
My heart would break in 2 if I should loose you
It's no good without you anyhow
Have I told you lately that I love you
Well darling, I'm telling you now
Have I told you how the nights are lone
When you're not with me
Well darling, I'm telling you now
My heart would break in 2 if I should loose you
It's no good without you anyhow
Have I told you lately that I love you
Well darling, I'm telling you now
Well darling, I'm telling you now.
