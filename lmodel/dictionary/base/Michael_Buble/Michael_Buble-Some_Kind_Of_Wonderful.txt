<song artist="Michael_Buble" title="Some_Kind_Of_Wonderful">
All you have to do is touch my hand
To show me you understand 
And something happens to me 
That's some kind of wonderful
At any time my little world seems blue
I just have to look at you
And everything seems to be
Some kind of wonderful
I know I can't express
This feeling of tenderness
There's so much I wanna say
But the right words don't come my way
I only know when I'm in your embrace
And this world seems a better place
And something happens to me
There's some kind of wonderful
And it's wonderful, baby
It's wonderful
Oh, so divine
Hmmmm, yeahhh
I know I can't express
This feeling of tenderness 
There's so much I wanna say
But the right words don't come my way
I only know when I'm in your embrace
And this world seems a better place
And something happens to me
You're like some kind of wonderful
And it's wonderful, baby
Whoaoaooohh
Oh, so divine
Whoaohhh, baby
And it's wonderful baby, baby, baby, baby
I understand
And it's some kind of wonderful
And it's wonderful baby, baby, baby, baby, please
You know you're some kind of wonderful
Whoaoh, baby
So much I wanna say
