Spiderman, Spiderman
Does whatever a spider can
Spins a web, any size
Catches thieves- just like flies
Look out! Here comes the Spiderman
Is he strong? Listen, bud
He's got radioactive blood
Can he swing, from a thread?
Take a look overhead
Hey, there! There goes the Spiderman
In the chill of night, at the scene of a crime
Like a streak of  light
He arrives, just in time
Spiderman, Spiderman
Friendly neighborhood Spiderman
Wealth and fame? He's ignored
Action is his reward
Look out! Here comes the Spiderman
Spiderman, Spiderman
Friendly neighborhood Spiderman
Wealth and fame? He's ignored
Action is his reward
Look out! Here comes the Spiderman
The chill of night, at the scene of a crime
Like a streak of light
He arrives, just in time
Spiderman, Spiderman
Does whatever a spider can
Spins a web, any size
Catches thieves- just like flies
Look out! Here comes the Spiderman
Spiderman, Spiderman
Friendly neighborhood Spiderman
Wealth and fame? He's ignored
Action is his reward
Look out! Here comes the Spider,,,man
