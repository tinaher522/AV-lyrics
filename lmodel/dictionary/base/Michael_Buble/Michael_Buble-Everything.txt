<song artist="Michael_Buble" title="Everything">
You're a falling star
You're the getaway car
You're the line in the sand
When I go too far
You're the swimming pool
On an August day
And you're the perfect thing to say
And you play it coy
But it's kinda cute
Oh when you smile at me
You know exactly what you do
Baby don't pretend
That you don't know it's true
'Cause you can see it
When I look at you
CHORUS:
And in this crazy life
And through these crazy times
It's you, it's you
You make me sing
You're every line
You're every word
You're everything
You're a carousel
You're a wishing well
And you light me up
When you ring my bell
You're a mystery
You're from outer space
You're every minute of my every day
And I can't believe
That I'm your man
And I get to kiss you baby
Just because I can
Whatever comes our way
We'll see it through
And you know
That's what our love can do
CHORUS:
And in this crazy life
And through these crazy times
It's you, it's you
You make me sing
You're every line
You're every word
You're everything
And so la la la la, la la la
So la la la la, la la la
CHORUS:
And in this crazy life
And through these crazy times
It's you, it's you
You make me sing
You're every line
You're every word
You're everything
You're every song
And I sing along
'Cause you're my everything
Yeah, yeah
So la la la la, la la la
So la la la la, la la-la-la
La la la
