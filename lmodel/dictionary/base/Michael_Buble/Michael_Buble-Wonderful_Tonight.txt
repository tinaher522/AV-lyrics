<song artist="Michael_Buble" title="Wonderful_Tonight">
It's late in the evening; she's wondering what clothes to wear.
She puts on her make-up and brushes her long blonde hair.
And then she asks me, "Do I look all right?"
And I say, "Yes, you look wonderful tonight."
A noite é de festa, e ela veste o luar
Me arrasta me testa; se sente uma superstar
E então pergunta se eu estou em paz
E eu digo sim;
I feel wonderful tonight
I feel wonderful because I see
The love light in your eyes
And the wonder of it all
Is that you just don't realize how much I love you.
I feel wonderful because I see
The love light in your eyes
And the wonder of it all
Is that you just don't realize how much I love you.
De volta para casa; cansados de festejar
Me deita me abraça, me beija não quer fala
And then I tell her as I turn off the lights
Darling, estavas linda até de mais
I say my darling, you look wonderful tonight
I say my darling you were wonderful tonight
