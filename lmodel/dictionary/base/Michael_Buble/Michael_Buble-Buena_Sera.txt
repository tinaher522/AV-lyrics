<song artist="Michael_Buble" title="Buena_Sera">
Buona sera, signorina, buona sera 
It is time to say goodnight to Napoli
Though it's hard for us to whisper Buona Sera 
With that old moon above the Mediterranean Sea
In the morning, signorina, we'll go walking 
Where the mountains and the sun come into sight 
And by the little jewlershop we stop and linger
While I buy a wedding ring for your finger
In the meantime let me tell you that I love you
Buona sera signorina kiss me good night
