<song artist="Michael_Buble" title="To_Love_Somebody">
There's a light,
a certain kind of light
that never shone on me.
I want my life to be lived with you,
lived with you.
There's a way, everybody say,
to do each and every little thing.
But what does it bring
if I ain't got you, ain't got?
Baby, you don't know what it's like.
Baby, you don't know what it's like
to love somebody,
to love somebody,
to love somebody
the way I love you.
In my brain
I see your face again.
I know my frame of mind.
You ain't got to be so blind.
And I'm blind, so very blind.
I'm a man,
can't you see what I am?
I live and breathe for you.
But what good does it do
if I ain't got you, ain't got?
Baby, you don't know what it's like.
Baby, you don't know what it's like
to love somebody,
to love somebody,
to love somebody
the way I love you.
