<song artist="Michael_Buble" title="To_Be_Loved">
Someone to care
Someone to share
Those lonely hours
And moments of despair
To be loved
To be loved
Oooh
Whatta feelin
To be loved
Yee
Someone to kiss
Someone to miss
When you're away
To here from each day
To be loved
To be loved
Oooh
Whatta feelin
To be loved
ooh
Some wished you be
A king or a queen
Some wish for fortune and friends
But you'll be truly
Truly truly love
But there's more
one of these things
You want
Someone to kiss
Someone to miss
When you're away
To here from each day
To be loved
To be loved
Oooh
Whatta feelin
To be loved
Oooh
But to feel
Truly love baby
There's more
One of these things
Someone to miss
Oooh someone to kiss
When you're away
To here from each day
To be loved
To be loved
Oooh
Whatta feelin
To be loved
To be loved
To be loved
To be loved
ooh
Whatta feelin 
To be loved
