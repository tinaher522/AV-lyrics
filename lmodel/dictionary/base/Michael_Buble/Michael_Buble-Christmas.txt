<song artist="Michael_Buble" title="Christmas">
The snow's comin' down / Christmas 
I'm watchin' it fall / Christmas 
Lots of people around / Christmas 
Baby, please come home 
The church bells in town / Christmas 
are ringin' a song / Christmas 
What a happy sound / Christmas 
Baby, please come home 
They're singin' 'Deck the Halls' 
But it's not like Christmas at all 
I remember when you were here 
And all the fun we had last year 
Pretty lights on the tree / Christmas 
I'm watchin' 'em shine / Christmas 
You should be here with me / Christmas 
Baby, please come home 
They're singin' 'Deck the Halls' 
But it's not like Christmas at all 
I remember when you were here 
And all the fun we had last year 
If there was a way / Christmas 
I'd hold back these tears / Christmas 
But it's Christmas day / Christmas 
(please) please (please) please (please) please (please) (please) please (please) I'm coming home
Ohhh baby. 
You know I need you
I'm coming home
I gotta have ya
You know I need you
I gotta have ya
I'm saying nanaanana
This christmas, christmas, christmas yeah!
