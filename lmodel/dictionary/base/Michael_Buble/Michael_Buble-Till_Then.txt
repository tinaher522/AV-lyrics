<song artist="Michael_Buble" title="Till_Then">
Till then, my darling please wait for me
Till then, no matter when it will be
Someday I know I'll be back again
Please wait till then
Our dreams will live though we are apart
Our love will always I know we'll keep in our heart
Till then, till all the world will be free
Please wait for me
Although there are oceans we must cross
And mountains that we must climb
I know every gain must have a loss
Let's pray that our loss is nothing but time
Till then, we'll dream of what there may be
Till then, we'll call on each memory
Till then, till I can hold you again
Please wait till then
