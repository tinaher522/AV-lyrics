<song artist="Michael_Buble" title="I_Got_It_Easy">
Never been in trouble,
And never got hurt.
Never had to struggle,
And never had to work.
Hard for anything before, believe me!
Lord, I've got it easy!
I feel guilty little, I've been given so much
People are dying in dark while I'm lying in the sun
And I sleep like a baby, every night it seems
I'm having the sweetest dreams!
I can say honestly, I got it easy!
I'm not trying to brag about it
So I say I appreciate it completely
And when I'm acting a fool, you're never cool to me!
I got it easy, yeah, yeah, oh, oh, yeah, yeah!
It probably isn't much fun to be alone
I wouldn't know, cause I've got you here, keeping me..
And when I'm lost, you say me straight sometimes I'm needed
You raise me up, babe! I got it easy!
Oh, some people drown in here, while I'm walking is only needed
I don't mind in a bit all this cold rainy evening
I'm warm in bed, got a beautiful woman beneath me
And when I, I got it easy, yeah, yeah, oh, oh, yeah
I got it easy, yeah, yeah, oh, oh, yeah, yeah!
All this wide opened to me
But it's love and it completes me
Lord, I got it easy!
