<song artist="Michael_Buble" title="You_Make_Me_Feel_So_Young">
You make me feel so spring and proud 
And every time I see you 
I'm such a happy 
Individual in the moment that you speak
I wanna go play highs in the seak
I wanna go and buts the moon
Just like blow a balloon 
You and I are just like a couple of cats
Running in the middle 
Get up all those forget me laps 
You make me feel so young 
You make me feel that our sun is our sun
And a wonderful ...
I'm gonna feel the way I do 
Cause you, you make me feel so young
You make me on 
You make me feel that the spring sparkles
Every time i see it there 
I such a happy 
Individual in the moment that you speak 
I wanna go play highs in the seek
I wanna go and buts at the moon
Like blow a big balloon 
Because you and I are just like a couple of cats
Running cross the middle 
You make me up 
You make me feel so lucky 
And even when I...
I gonna feel the way i do 
Today 
Cause you make me feel so 
Man i just be a ...
You make me feel young
Yee you me feel so young 
You make me feel so young 
You make me feel so young 
You make me feel so young
