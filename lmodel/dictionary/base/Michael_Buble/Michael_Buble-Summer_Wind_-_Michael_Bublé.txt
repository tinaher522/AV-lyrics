<song artist="Michael_Buble" title="Summer_Wind_-_Michael_BublÃ©">
The summer wind came blowin' in
From across the sea
It lingered there, touched your hair
And walked with me
All summer long, we sang a song
Then we strolled that golden sand
Two sweethearts and the summer wind
Like painted kites
Those days and nights went flying by
The world was new
Beneath a blue umbrella sky
Then softer than a piper man
One day, it called to you
I lost you to the summer wind
The autumn wind and the winter wind
They have come and gone
But still the days, those lonely days
Go on and on
But guess who sighs his lullabies
Through nights that never end?
My fickle friend, the summer wind
Oh, the autumn wind and the winter wind
They have come and gone
But still the days, those lonely days
Go on and on
And guess who sighs his lullabies
Through nights that never end?
My fickle friend, the summer wind
Ooh, that summer wind
Warm, warm summer wind
Mmm, that summer wind
