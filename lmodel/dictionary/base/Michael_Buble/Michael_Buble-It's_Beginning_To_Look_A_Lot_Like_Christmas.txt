<song artist="Michael_Buble" title="It's_Beginning_To_Look_A_Lot_Like_Christmas">
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas, 
Everywhere you go, 
Take a look at the 5 and 10, 
It's glistening once again, 
With candy canes and silver lanes that glow.
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas, 
Toys in every store, 
But the prettiest sight to see, 
Is the holly that will be, 
On your own front door.
A pair of hop-along boots and a pistol that shoots, 
Is the wish of Barney and Ben, 
Dolls that will talk and go for a walk, 
Is the hope of Janice and Jen, 
Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again.
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas, 
Everywhere you go, 
There's a tree in the grand hotel 
One in the park as well 
It's the sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow.
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas, 
Soon the bells will start, 
And the think that'll make them ring, 
Is the carol that you sing, 
Right within your heart.
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas, 
Toys in every store, 
But the prettiest sight to see, 
Is the holly that will be, 
On your own front door.
Sure It's Christmas, 
Once More.
