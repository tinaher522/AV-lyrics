<song artist="Michael_Buble" title="Daddy's_Little_Girl">
You're the end of the rainbow, my pot of gold
You're daddy's little girl to have and hold
A precious gem is what you are
You're mommy's bright and shining star
You're the spirit of Christmas, my star on the tree
You're the Easter bunny to mommy and me
You're sugar you're spice, you're everything nice
And you're daddy's little girl
