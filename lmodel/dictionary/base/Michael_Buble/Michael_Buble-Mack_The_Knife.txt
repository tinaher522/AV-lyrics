<song artist="Michael_Buble" title="Mack_The_Knife">
Oh, the shark, babe, has such teeth, dear
And he shows them pearly white
Just a jackknife has old MacHeath, babe
And he keeps it,  out of sight
Ya know when that shark bites with his teeth, dear
Scarlet billows start to spread
Fancy gloves, wears old MacHeath, babe
So there's never, never a trace of red
Oh, Sunday, Sunday mornin'
Lies a body just oozin' life
And someone's sneakin' round the corner
Could that someone be Mack the Knife?
From a tugboat, down by the river dontcha know
Where a cement bag's just a'drooppin' on down
That cement's there, it's there for the weight, dear
Now Five'll get ya ten old Macky's back in town
Now d'ja hear 'bout Louie Miller? He disappeared, babe
After drawin' out all his hard-earned cash
now MacHeath spends, just like a sailor
Could it be that boy done somethin' rash?
Ahhhh Jenny Diver, ho, Sukey Tawdry
Ooh, Miss Lotte Lenya and old Lucy Brown
yes, the line forms on the right, babe
Now that Macky's back in town
I said Jenny Diver, whoa, Sukey Tawdry
Look out to Miss Lotte Lenya and old Lucy Brown
Yes, that line forms on the right, babe
Now that Macky's back in town
Look out, old Macky is back!
