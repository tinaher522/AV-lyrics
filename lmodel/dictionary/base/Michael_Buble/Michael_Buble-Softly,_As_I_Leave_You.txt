<song artist="Michael_Buble" title="Softly,_As_I_Leave_You">
Softly, I will leave you softly
For my heart would break
If you should leave
And see me go
So I leave you softly
Long before you miss me
Long before your arms beg me to stay
For one more hour
For one more day
After all the years
I can't bear the tears
To fall, so softly
As I leave you there
Softly, long before you kiss me
Long before your arms can beg me stay
For one more hour
For one more day
After all the years
I can't bear the tears
To fall, so softly
As I leave you there
As I leave you there
As I leave you there
