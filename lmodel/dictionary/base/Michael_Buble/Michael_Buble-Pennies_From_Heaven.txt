<song artist="Michael_Buble" title="Pennies_From_Heaven">
Every time it rains,it rains
Pennies from heaven
Don't you know each cloud contains
Pennies from heaven
You'll find your fortune's falling
All over the town
Be sure that your umbrella
Is upside down
Trade them for a package of
Sunshine and flowers
If you want the things you love,
You gotta have showers
So when you hear it thunder,
Don't run under a tree
There'll be pennies from heaven
For you and me
