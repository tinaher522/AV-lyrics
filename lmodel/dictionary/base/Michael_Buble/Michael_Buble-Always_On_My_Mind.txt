<song artist="Michael_Buble" title="Always_On_My_Mind">
Maybe I didn't treat you
Quite as good as I should have
Maybe I didn't love you
Quite as often as I could have
Little things I should have said and done
I just never took the time
You are always on my mind
You are always on my mind
Maybe I didn't hold you
All those lonely, lonely times
And I guess I never told you
I'm so happy that you're mine
If I made you feel second place
Girl, I'm sorry I was blind
You are always on my mind
You are always on my mind
Tell me, tell me that your sweet love hasn't died
Give me, give me more chance to keep you satisfied...satisfied
Little things I should have said and done
I just never took the time
You are always on my mind
You are always on my mind
