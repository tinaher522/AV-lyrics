<song artist="Michael_Buble" title="Maria_Elena">
Maria Elena you're the answer to a prayer
Maria Elena can't you see how much I care
To me your voice is like the echo of a sigh
And when you're near my heart
Can't speak above a sigh
Maria Elena say we two will never part
Maria Elena take me to your heart
A love like mine is great enough for two
To share this love is really all I ask of you
