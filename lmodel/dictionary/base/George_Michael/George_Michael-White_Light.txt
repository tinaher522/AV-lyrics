<song artist="George_Michael" title="White_Light">
I'm back
I'm back
Prouder than ever baby
Louder than ever maybe
One more pill
Just one more beer
One less star in the atmosphere
For us
Maybe she just wanted to be free
Heartless pictures on TV
Change that channel that could've been me
I said
Maybe she just wanted to be free
So I just kept breathing my friends
Waiting for the man to choose
Saying this ain't the day that it ends
Cause there's no white light
And I'm not through
I'm alive
I'm alive
And I've got so much more that I want to do
With the music
Was it music that saved me?
Or the way that you prayed for me?
Guess either way I thank you
I'm alive
Hotel Motel makes it clear
One more voice we will never hear again
But maybe he just wanted to be free
And I don't know
What the hell
What the gods
What the fuck
I'm saying
Half the time
But something divine
Oh devine
Brought me back to you
And I know it
So I just kept breathing my friends
Waiting for some god to choose
Saying this ain't the day that it ends
Cause there's no white light
And I'm not through
I'm alive
I'm alive
And I've got so much more that I want to do
Was it music?
Was it science that saved me?
Or the way that you prayed for me
Guess either way I thank you
I'm alive
And tomorrow is mine
I said tomorrow is mine
Said I just got to keep on breathing
I said no
Don't let goooo
Breathing breathing breathing
Got to keep on
Got to keep on
Got to keep on
I just got to keep on breathing
I'm alive
I'm alive
And I got so much more that I want to give
Was it music?
Was it science that saved me?
Or the way that you prayed and prayed for me
Well I thank you
I'm a-live
Yeah
Mmm hmmm
Mmm hmmm
