<song artist="George_Michael" title="Freeek!">
You got yourself some action
Said you got yourself a body
You got yourself an ass with
A mind of its own brings something to the party
You got yourself addicted
You shoot up, it saves you time
You got yourself a paycheck
Faces in the places where the sun don't shine
I'll be your sexual freak (freak)
Of the week
I'll be your inspirational brother (sister)
Yo mama can't you see
I'll be your sexual freak
Of the week (Ooh touch it)
I'll be your educational lover
Your one fuck fantasy
Can I come on in, my sweet baby
Can I move on in
Can I come on in, my sweet baby
Can I move on in
You got yourself some action
Said you got your sexy Java
You got your speed connection
Free chat, fuck that, get a little harder
You got yourself a big bed
You shoot off, take your time
In the house with a bitch and a mouse
And your daddy's plastic, how fantastic yeah
I'll be your sexual freak (Back up on this)
Of the week (Yeah... I think I need to re-booty)
I'll be your inspirational brother (Sister)
Yo mama can't you see
I'll be your sexual freak (B-b-back)
Of the week (B-b-push back, sexy mama) (Sexual)
I'll be your educational lover
(Yeah) Your one fuck fantasy
Sexual freak (Sister)
I think I need a re-booty
Sexual freak (Sister)
I'll be your sexual freak of the week
I'll be your inspirational brother, yo mama can't you see
I'll be your sexual freak of the week
I'll be your educational lover, your one fuck fantasy
(Sister) (Baby) Sexual freak, (Baby) inspirational brother
You got yourself some action
Said you got yourself a body
You got yourself an ass with mind of its own brings something to the party
Come on kids, don't be scared
It's a tits and ass world you gotta be prepared
Come on kids, don't be scared
It's a tits and ass world you gotta be prepared
Come on kids, you know your mama and your daddy don't care
Don't be scared, it's a tits and ass world you gotta be prepared
