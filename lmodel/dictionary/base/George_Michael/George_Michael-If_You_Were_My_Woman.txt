<song artist="George_Michael" title="If_You_Were_My_Woman">
If you were my woman
And I was your man
There would be no other woman
You'd be weak as a lamb
If you had the strength to walk out that door
My love would overrule my sense I would call you back for more
If you were my woman
If you were my woman
And I was your man, Yeah!
He tears you down darlin'
Says your nothing at all
But I'll be there for darlin'
When he lets you fall
Your like a diamond
But he treats you like glass
Yet you beg him to love you
With me you don't ask
If you were my woman
If you were my woman
Here's what I'd do, Oh
I'd never, no, no, no stop lovin' you
Whoa! Yeah!
My darlin'
Life is so crazy
And love is so unkind
Because he came first, darlin'
Will he hang on your mind
Your a part of me
And you don't even know it
I'm what you need
But I'm too afraid to show it
If you were my woman
Here's what I'd do, Oh
I'd never, no, no, no
Whoa! Oh!
My darlin' If you were my woman
Sweet lovin' woman
I said
If you were my woman
If you were my woman
I said
If you were my woman
If you were my woman
Here's what I would do, Oh
I'd never, no, no, no stop lovin' you
Whoa! Yeah!
Never, never, no
Hmm...
