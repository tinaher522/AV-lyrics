<song artist="George_Michael" title="You_Know_That_I_Want_To">
Lover don't love too much 
It's a bad thing, a sad thing 
And it's heaven to the touch 
Hey, everybody's got some moment in their life 
They can't change (don't they, baby?)
I know you don't care what's right or wrong 
All that I know 
Is that love don't belong here 
And so it's better to turn the page
And watch me walk away, 
My dear, watch me walk away 
But you say 
I can't stop but you know that I want to 
I can't stop don't you know that I want you 
I want you baby (more than ever) 
I can't stop but you know that I want to 
I can't stop don't you know that I want you 
But it's never gonna be that easy child
Lover don't love too much
I'm a bad boy, I'm a sad boy
And I'll never give you much
Hey, everybody's got some moment in their life
They can't change
So I do not dare to take you home
All that I know
Is that something is so wrong with this heat
Why do you touch the flame?
You know you feel the pain, my dear
You always find it here
But you say
I can't stop but you know that I want to
I can't stop don't you know that I want you
(Please don't say it) 
I want you baby (more that ever)
I can't stop but you know that I want to
I can't stop don't you know that I want you
But it's never gonna be that easy child
You need a lover
And I am just a friend ................
