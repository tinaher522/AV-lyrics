<song artist="George_Michael" title="One_More_Try">
I've had enough of danger 
And people on the streets 
I'm looking out for angels
Just trying to find some peace
Now I think it's time
That you let me know
So if you love me, say you love me
But if you don't just let me go 
'Cause teacher
There are things that I don't want to learn
And the last one I had made me cry 
So I don't want to learn to
Hold you, touch you
Think that you're mine 
Because there ain't no joy
For an uptown boy
Whose teacher has told him goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye 
When you were just a stranger
And I was at your feet
I didn't feel the danger
Now I feel the heat
That look in your eyes
Telling me no 
So you think that you love me, know that you need me 
I wrote the song, I know it's wrong
Just let me go
And teacher 
There are things that I don't want to learn 
Oh, the last one I had made me cry
So I don't want to learn to
Hold you, touch you 
Think that you're mine
Because there ain't no joy 
For an uptown boy 
Whose teacher has told him goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
So when you say that you need me 
That you'll never leave me
I know you're wrong, you're not that strong
Let me go
And teacher 
There are things that I still have to learn
But the one thing I have is my pride
Oh, so I don't want to learn to
Hold you, touch you
Think that you're mine
Because there ain't no joy
For an uptown boy
Who just isn't willing to try
I'm so cold inside 
Maybe just one more try
