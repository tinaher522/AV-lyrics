<song artist="George_Michael" title="Fame">
Fame, makes a man take things over
Fame, lets him loose, hard to swallow
Fame, puts you there, where things are hollow
Fame
Fame, it's not your brain, it's just the flame
that burns the change to keep you insane
Fame
Fame, what you like is in the Limo
Fame, what you get is no tomorrow
Fame, what you need you have to borrow
Fame
Fame, "Nien! It's mine!" is just his line
to bind your time, it drives you to, ah, crime
Fame
Could it be the best, could it be?
Really be, really, babe?
Could it be, my babe, could it, babe?
Really be, really, babe?

Is it any wonder
I reject you first?
Fame, fame, fame, fame
Is it any wonder
you're too cool to fool
Fame
Fame, bully for you, chilly for me
Got to get a rain-check on pain
Fame

ba ba be
ba be ba be
ba be ba be
ba ba ba ba

baby, baby
baby
Fame
What's your name?
