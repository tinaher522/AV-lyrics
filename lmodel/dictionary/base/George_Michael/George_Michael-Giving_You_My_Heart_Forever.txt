<song artist="George_Michael" title="Giving_You_My_Heart_Forever">
don't ask me how it could be
sometimes it's hard to believe
that in my lifetime i could find that someone 
who can make me complete
you are the air that i breathe
i'd surely die if you leave
'cause i have never felt this way ' bout any girl like i feel for you
so this is what i'm gonna do
i'm giving you my heart forever
every beat of my heart says it's true
i know we'll always be together forever
you lovin' me - me lovin' you
and i'm giving you my heart to you
you are so special to me
your love is all that i need
and i'm gonna spend the rest of my life
loving you faithfully
this love i feel is so strong
with you my heart's found a home
'cause no one in this world could ever love me so tenderly
so you can best believe
i'm giving you my heart forever
every beat of my heart says it's true
my love for you won't fade no never
you lovin' me - me lovin' you
and i'm giving you my heart to you
and when i'm holding you close to me

i know all of my dreams have come true
wanna let you know how i feel
girl my love is for real
and i just wanna give it to you
i'm giving you my heart forever
every beat of my heart says it's true
i know we'll always be together forever
you lovin' me - me lovin' you
and i'm giving you my heart to you to you
and when i'm holding you close to me
i know all of my dreams have come true
wanna let you know how i feel
girl my love is for real
and i just wanna give it to you
i'm giving you my heart forever
every beat of my heart says it's true
my love for you won't fade no never
you lovin' me - me lovin' you
and i'm giving you my heart to you
i'm giving you my heart forever
every beat of my heart says it's true
i know we'll always be together forever
you lovin' me - me lovin' you
and i'm giving you my heart to you
to you and i'm giving my heart to you
