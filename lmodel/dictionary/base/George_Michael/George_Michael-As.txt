<song artist="George_Michael" title="As">
As around the sun the earth knows she's revolving
And the rosebuds know to bloom in early May
Just as hate knows love's the cure
You can rest your mind assure
That I'll be loving you always
As now can't reveal the mystery of tomorrow
But in passing will grow older every day
Just as all is born is new
Do know what I say is true
That I'll be loving you always
Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky (Always)
Until the ocean covers every mountain high (I said, it's gonna be always)
Until the day that 8 times 8 times 8 is 4 (You know it's gonna be always)
Until the day that is the day that I'm no more
Did you know that true love asks for nothing?
Her acceptance is the way we pay
Did you know that life has given love a guarantee
To last through forever and another day?
As today I know I'm living
But tomorrow could make me the past
But that I mustn't fear, 'cause you're here
As today I know I'm living but tomorrow
Could make me the past but that I mustn't fear
For I'll know deep in my mind
The love of me I've left behind
And I'll be loving you always
Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky (Loving you)
Until the ocean covers every mountain high (I'll be loving you)
Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea (Loving you)
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream (Now, ain't that loving you?)
Until the day is night and night becomes the day (Always)
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away (I'll be loving you forever)
Until the day that 8 times 8 times 8 is 4 (Always)
Until the day that is the day that are no more
Did you know that true love asks for nothing? (True love don't want a thing)
Her acceptance is the way we pay
Did you know that life has given love a guarantee
To last through forever and another day?
As around the sun the earth knows she's revolving
And the rosebuds know to bloom in early May
For I'll know deep in my mind
The love of me I've left behind
And I'll be loving you always
Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky (I'll be loving you)
Until the ocean covers every mountain high (Always)
Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea (Forever)
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream (Now, ain't that loving you?)
Until the day is night and night becomes the day (Now, ain't that loving you?)
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away (I'll be loving you forever)
Until the day that 8 times 8 times 8 is 4
Until the day that is the day that are no more
Always, always, alwaysâ€¦
