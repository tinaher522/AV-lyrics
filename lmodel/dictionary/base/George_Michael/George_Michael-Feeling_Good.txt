<song artist="George_Michael" title="Feeling_Good">
Birds flying high
You know how I feel
Sun in the sky
You know how I feel
Breeze driftin' on by
You know how I feel
It's a new dawn
It's a new day
It's a new life
For me
It's a new dawn
It's a new day
And I'm feeling so...
Fish in the sea
You know how I feel
River running free
You know how I feel
Blossom on the tree
You know how I feel
It's a new day
It's a new dawn
It's a new life
For me
And I'm feeling good
Dragonfly out in the sun
You know what I mean
Butterflies all havin' fun
You know what I mean
Sleep in peace when the day is done
That's what I mean
And this old world is a new world
And a bold world
For me
You know just how I feel
It's a new day
It's a new dawn
It's a new life
Stars when you shine
You know how I feel
Scent of the pine
You know how I feel
Oh freedom is mine
And I know how I feel
It's a new dawn
It's a new day
It's a new life
And I'm feeling good
