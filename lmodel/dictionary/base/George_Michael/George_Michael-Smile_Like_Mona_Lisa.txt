<song artist="George_Michael" title="Smile_Like_Mona_Lisa">
Oh, I carry a photograph 
Girl of the way you used to be
Love looking back at me, 
Now it's just a memory 
You were all laughter then 
And you were my light when it was dark 
How did we lose our way, 
How did we fall apart 
'Cause something in our kisses 
Said love would never end 
And deep down you still feel it too 
But you won't let me in 
[Chorus]
So when you smile like Mona Lisa 
My heart falls to pieces 
'Cause smiling just can't hide 
All the sadness in your eyes 
If I could only hold you 
Love you like I used to
But girl what can I do 
When you smile like Mona Lisa 
The way that I held you close 
The way that you whispered my name 
We made it a work of art 
Now there's just an empty frame 
All we had
Baby we could have again 
And deep down you still feel it too 
But you won't let me in
Repeat 2x [Chorus]
I carry a photograph 
Of the way you used to be...
