<song artist="George_Michael" title="Teacher">
I've had enough of danger
People on the streets
I'm looking out for angels
Just tryin' to find some peace
I think it's time
That you let me know
So if you love me, say you love me
But if you don't 
Just let me go
'Cause teacher there are things that I don't want to learn
And the last one I had made me cry
So I don't wanna learn to hold you, touch you
Think that you're mine
Because there ain't no joy
For an uptown boy
Whose teacher has told him goodbye..goodbye...goodbye
When you were just a stranger
And I was at your feet
I didn't feel the danger
Now I feel the heat
That look in your eyes
Tellin' me no
So you think that you love me
Know that you need me
I wrote this song, I know it's wrong, just let me go
And teacher, there are things that I don't want to learn
Oh the last one I had made me cry
So I don't wanna learn to hold you, touch you
Think that you're mine
'Cause there ain't no joy
For an uptown boy
Whose teacher has told him goodbye
So when you say that you need me
That you'll never leave me
I know you're wrong, you're not that strong
Let me go
And teacher, there are things that I still have to learn
But the one thing I have
Is my pride
Oh so I don't wanna learn to hold you, touch you
Think that your mine
Because there ain't no joy
For an uptown boy
Who just isn't willing to try
I'm so cold inside
Maybe just one more try.
