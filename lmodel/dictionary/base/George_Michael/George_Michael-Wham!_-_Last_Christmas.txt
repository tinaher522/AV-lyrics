<song artist="George_Michael" title="Wham!_-_Last_Christmas">
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance but you still catch my eye
Tell me baby do you recognize me?
Well it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me
(Happy Christmas)
I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying, "I Love You," I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kissed me now I know you'd fool me again
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
(Ooh ooh baby)
A crowded room, friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
My God I thought you were someone to rely on
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A man undercover but you tore me apart ooh ooh
Now I've found a real love you'll never fool me again
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
(Gave you my heart)
A man undercover but you tore me apart next year
I'll give it to someone, I'll give it to someone special
Special someone, someone
I'll give it to someone, I'll give it to someone special
Who'll give me something in return, I'll give it to someone
Hold my heart and watch it burn
I'll give it to someone, I'll give it to someone special
I've got you here to stay, I can love you for a day
I thought you were someone special gave you my heart
I'll give it to someone, I'll give it to someone
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
You gave it away
I'll give it to someone, I'll give it to someone
