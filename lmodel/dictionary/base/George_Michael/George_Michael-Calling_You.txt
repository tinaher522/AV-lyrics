<song artist="George_Michael" title="Calling_You">
A desert road from Vegas to nowhere
Someplace better than where you've been
A coffee machine that needs some fixin'
In a little cafe just around the bend
I am calling you
Can't you hear me?
I am calling you
I am calling you
Can't you hear me?
I am calling you
A desert road from Vegas to nowhere
Someplace better than where you've been
A coffee machine that needs some fixin'
In a little cafe just around the bend
A hot dry wind blows right through me
The baby's crying so I can't sleep
But we both know the change is coming
Come in closer, sweet release
I am calling you
Can't you hear me?
I am calling you
Desert road from Vegas to nowhere
