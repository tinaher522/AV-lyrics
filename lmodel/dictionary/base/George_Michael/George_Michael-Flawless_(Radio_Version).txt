All the boys say yeah, all the boys say yeah

Perfection, flawless, absolutely flawless
Perfection, flawless, absolutely flawless
Perfection, flawless, absolutely flawless
Perfection, flawless, absolutely flawless
And it's no good, and it's no good
And it's no good waiting by the window
It's no good waiting for the sun
Please believe me, the things you dream of
They don't fall in the laps of no one
And it's no good waiting, waiting
And it's no good waiting
You got to go to the city
You got to go to the city
You got to go to the city
You got to go to the city
Always the same
Always the same
Dreams yeah, yeah
Yes, you're movin' up
Well you've gotta think of something
'Cause your job pays you nothing
But you got the things God gave you
So the music may yet be your savior
Gotta be a way, some way
Gotta be some way to make your way to the light
All the girls say, gotta be some way, today, today
Maybe tonight, maybe tonight
And it's always the same
Always the same
Always the same, dreams yeah, yeah
Always the same, yes, you're movin' up
You're beautiful, you are, and you know it
You're wasted here, you're a star
In this small town of hand-me-downs
Who don't even know it
Sometimes it brings you down, sometimes it eats you up
Sometimes you think that your head's going to blow it
It doesn't, it doesn't, it doesn't, it doesn't, it doesn't get better
Don't you know, you've gotta go to the city
You gotta reach the other side of the glass
I think you'll make it in the city, baby
I think you know that you are more than just
Some fucked up piece of ass
Gotta be a way, some way
Gotta be some way to make your way to the light
All the boys say yeah, gotta be some way, today, today
Maybe tonight, they'll see you tonight
It's always the same
Always the same
Dreams yeah, yeah
Always the same yes, you're movin' up
'Cause you're beautiful
All the boys say yeah, all the boys say yeah
All the boys say yeah
'Cause you're beautiful
All the boys say yeah, all the boys say yeah
All the boys say yeah
'Cause you're beautiful
All the boys say yeah, all the boys say yeah
All the boys say yeah, all the boys say yeah
'Cause you're beautiful
All the boys say yeah, all the boys say yeah
All the boys say yeah, all the boys say yeah
