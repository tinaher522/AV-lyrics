<song artist="George_Michael" title="Father_Figure">
That's all I wanted
Something special, something sacred 
In your eyes
For just one moment
To be bold and naked 
At your side 
Sometimes I think that you'll never 
Understand me (understand me)
Maybe this time is forever 
Say it can be, woah
That's all you wanted 
Something special, someone sacred 
In your life
Just for one moment 
To be warm and naked 
At my side 
Sometimes I think that you'll never
Understand me (understand me)
But something tells me together 
We'd be happy, woah baby
I will be your father figure (oh baby)
Put your tiny hand in mine (I'd love to)
I will be your preacher teacher (be your daddy)
Anything you have in mind (it would make me)
I will be your father figure (very happy)
I have had enough of crime (please let me)
I will be the one who loves you
Till the end of time 
That's all I wanted 
But sometimes love can be mistaken 
For a crime
That's all I wanted
Just to see my baby's 
Blue-eyed shine 
This time I think that my lover 
Understands me (understands me)
If we have faith in each other 
Then we can be strong, baby
I will be your father figure 
Put your tiny hand in mine (my baby)
I will be your preacher teacher 
Anything you have in mind
I will be your father figure 
I have had enough of crime 
I will be the one who loves you 
Till the end of time
If you are the desert, I'll be the sea 
If you ever hunger, hunger for me 
Whatever you ask for, that's what I'll be 
So when you remember the ones who have lied
Who said that they cared
But then laughed as you cried
Beautiful darling
Don't think of me 
Because all I ever wanted 
It's in your eyes
Baby, baby
And love can't lie, no
(Greet me with the eyes of a child)
My love is always telling me so
(Heaven is a kiss and a smile)
Just hold on, hold on
And won't let you go, my baby
I will be your father figure 
Put your tiny hand in mine 
I will be your preacher teacher 
Anything you have in mind
I will be your father figure 
And I have had enough of crime 
So I am gonna love you
Till the end of time 
(I will be your father) I will be your
(I will be your preacher) Father
(I will be your father) I'll be your daddy, whoa
I will be the one who loves you 
Till the end of time
