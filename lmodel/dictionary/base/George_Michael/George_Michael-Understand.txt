<song artist="George_Michael" title="Understand">
Woman, don't you ever wonder 
Where you'd be if I just walked on by 
What's your name?
Can I take your number?
Darling come with me
I'm going to change your life 
When you're young you think you're winning 
Why worry 'til the babies cry? 
I was wrong; it's the blues we're singing 
Chasing after pennies just to survive. 
And there's no way the gods are hearing me baby 
They don't even try
They don't even try 
And all the things I said I'd give you 
Just seem to pass me by
No matter how I try 
I hope you understand 
This is not what I had planned for us 
God only knows if my dreams are coming or gone 
(Are coming or gone)
But you're still holding my hand
Sweetheart (Sweetheart) 
And for every single day you're here 
It's crystal clear 
That God isn't mad at me at all
He ain't mad at me at all 
And all this praying hard ain't gonna save the day 
Maybe that's really what I'm guilty of 
I know we live in times when love is not enough 
It's not enough
(No no no no no) 
And there's no way the gods are hearing me 
Baby, they don't even try
They don't even try 
And all the things I said I'd give you 
Just seem to pass me by
(No matter how I try)
I hope you understand 
This is not what I had planned for us 
Heaven only knows if our dreams are coming or gone 
(Coming or gone, coming or gone) 
But you're still holding my hand
Sweetheart (Sweetheart) 
So for every single day that you're here 
It's crystal clear 
That God isn't mad at me at all 
He ain't mad at me at all 
There's a place in my mind 
Somewhere we could be fine 
Where the children would play 
And we'd eat like kings every day 
(Some more promises)
(Like kings on Christmas Day)
