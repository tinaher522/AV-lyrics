<song artist="George_Michael" title="Miss_Sarajevo">
Is there a time for keeping a distance
A time to turn your eyes away
Is there a time for keeping your head down
For getting on with your day
Is there a time for kohl and lipstick
A time for cutting hair
Is there a time for high street shopping
To find the right dress to wear
Here she comes
Heads turn around
Here she comes
To take her crown
Is there a time to walk for cover
A time for kiss and tell
Is there a time for different colors
Different names you find it hard to spell
Is there a time for first communion
A time for east 17
Is there a time to turn the mecca
Is there a time to be a beauty queen
Here she comes
Beauty plays the crown
Here she comes
Surreal in her crown
Dici che il fiume
Trova la via al mare
E come il fiume
Giungerai a me
Oltre I confini
E le terre assetate
Dici che come fiume
Come fiume
Lamore giunger
Lamore
E non so pi pregare
E nellamore non so pi sperare
E quellamore non so pi aspettare
Is there a time for tying ribbons
A time for christmas trees
Is there a time for laying tables
When the night is set to freeze
