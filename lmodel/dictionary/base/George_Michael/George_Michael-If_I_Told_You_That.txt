Dark Child Hey baby,
ha ha ha
If I told you that
I wanted to see you
And if I told you that
I'd beg to please you
If I told you that
I'll always keep you
What would you say?
If I told you that
[George]
Now tell me how you'd feel
If I told you that
I had feelings for you, yeah
Tell me baby
[Whitney]
And would it be so wrong
To say what's on my mind
I'm sorry I have to baby, baby
We were friends
But with time
What I feel deep inside
For you has changed
But I'd give up for love
If I thought that it was untrue (Untrue)
For you (For you baby)
If I told you that
I wanted to see you
And if I told you that
I'd beg to please you
If I told you that
I'll always keep you
What would you say?
If I told you that
[George]
I know that we're just friends
But what if I decide
To bring something in,
ooh yeah Baby, baby
[Whitney]
I hope it won't offend
The trust we have cuz
I don't want this to end
No, no, no, baby
If you think we will lose what we have
Then I'd just rather stay the same
(Rather stay, rather stay the same)
Cuz I don't want to chose between two
Of the most precious things to me
(Precious things to me, oh yeah)
If I told you that
I wanted to see you
And if I told you that
I'd beg to please you
If I told you that
I'll always keep you
What would you say?
If I told you that
[Whitney](George)
If we (If we)
Take this chance (Take this chance)
And extend to each other romance
I hope (Baby I hope)
It would be (It would be)
The right thing for you and me, oh yeah
Baby, baby, baby, baby
If I told you that
I wanted to see you
And if I told you that
I'd beg to please you
If I told you that
I'll always keep you
What would you say?
If I told you that
If I told you that
If I told you that
I wanted to see you
And if I told you that
I'd beg to please you
If I told you that
I'll always keep you
What would you say?
If I told you that
If I told you that (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Would you be there for me?
(Could you?) Could you dare to hold me?
Will my feelings lead me, love always
(Baby what would you say?)
If I told you
If I told you that
I wanted to see you
And if I told you that
I'd beg to please you
If I told you that
I'll always keep you
What would you say?
If I told you that
