(keep dreaming)
star people
counting your money until you soul turns green
star people
counting the cost of you desire to be seen
I do not count myself among you
I may have been living in a dream
it's just that there seem so many of you
can't help but hope there's a difference between
and if I love to be a hundred and one
I will never understand what you are. honey?
I'm looking for sympathy
just get me on NBC
and where the hell's my dumb ass PR?
yeah-a-yeah
I said maybe your mama gave you up boy
(it's the same old, same old)
I said maybe your daddy didn't love you enough girl
(how much is enough)
star people
never gorget your secret's safe with me
just look at all the wonderfull people
trying to fotget just who and what they have been
oh (oh) it's a dream (it's a dream)
with a nightmare stuck in the middle (middle)
are you serious? I'm just curious
without all this attention
you'd die
I'd die
we'd die
and if I live to be a hundred and one (wouldn't we baby)
I will never understand what you are (ooh, I'm talking to you)
you're looking for sympathy from people who work to eat

and they don't really seem to mind
yeah-a-yeah
yeah-a-yeah
I said maybe your mama gave you up boy
(it's the same old, same old)
I said maybe (baby) your daddy didn't love you enough 
(love you enough) girl
how much is enough? 3x
are you serious? I'm just curious 7x
yeah, more glycerine
let's go back to the day
huh DJ (why do you wanna tell me that?)
DJ (get yourself some Oprah case)
is that what makes a star? ooh
do you really think you've got it so hard? huh?
do you think it might do you some good to look around you
and decide how you night feel
if the pain you felt was real
tell me
is that why you're a star?
now nothing comes for nothing baby oh
that fame and fortune's heaven sent
and who gives a f*** about your problems darling
cos you can pay the rent
you can pay, pay, pay, pay, pay, pay, pay, pay
you can pay, is that why you're a star?
cry baby, cry baby
baby you're a star
is that why you're a star?
baby, baby you're a star
