<song artist="George_Michael" title="The_Christmas_Song">
Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like eskimos
Everybody knows a turkey and some 
mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight
They know that Santa's on his way
He's bringing lots of toys and goodies

on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know hot to fly
And so I'm offering this simple wish
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times,
many ways
Merry Chrismas to you
*repeat last verse*
