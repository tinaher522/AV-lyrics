<song artist="George_Michael" title="Idol">
He was a light star
Tripping on a high wire
Bulldog stubborn
Born uneven
A classless creature
A man for all seasons
But don't bet them
They can't take him
To the very bottom
Because they made him
And they'll waste him
And I don't believe
That I want to watch them
'Cause the fifties shifted out of gear
He was an idol then
Now he's an idol here
But his face has changed
Oh he's not the same no more
And I have to say
That I like the way his music sounded before
He was tight-assed
Walking on broken glass
Highly prized in the wallet size
The number one crush
In a schoolgirl's eyes
But don't pretend
That it won't end
In the depth of your despair
You went from lame suits
Right down to tennis shoes
To peanuts
From the lion's share
'Cause the fifties shifted out of gear
He was an idol then
Now he's an idol here
But his face has changed
Oh he's not the same no more
And I have to say
That I like the way his music sounded before
