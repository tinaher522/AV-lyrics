<song artist="George_Michael" title="Song_To_The_Siren">
Long afloat on shipless oceans
I did all my best to smile
'Til your singing eyes and fingers
Drew me loving to your isle
And you sang
Sail to me
Sail to me
Let me enfold you
Here I am 
Here I am
Waiting to hold you 
Did I dream you dreamed about me?
Were you hare when I was fox
Now my foolish boat is leaning 
Broken lovelorn on your rocks,
For you sing, "Touch me not, touch me not, come back tomorrow:
O my heart, O my heart shies from the sorrow" 
But I'm as puzzled as the newborn child
I'm as riddled as the tide:
Should I stand amid the breakers?
Should I lie with Death my bride?
Hear me sing, "Swim to me, swim to me, let me enfold you:
Here I am, here I am, waiting to hold you"
