<song artist="George_Michael" title="A_Last_Request_(I_Want_Your_Sex_Part_III)">
It's late, time for bed
So I sit, and wait
For that gin and tonic
To go to your head
I know
It's a devious plan
But it's the only way that I know
To get those big bad car keys
Out of your hand
You know
That I remain a gentle man
But even so
There's only so much
A gentleman can stand
Sleep with me
Oh sleep with me tonight
My cards are on your table
My dreams are in your bed
If I was able
I'd be there instead
Sleep with me tonight
