<song artist="George_Michael" title="Crazyman_Dance">
Well I'm still here, but I'm so scared
Got myself in trouble, so much trouble
I know I've got to make it
But I just can't take New York
(New York) I just can't take New York
My middle name is fear
I have a vacant stare
And it's been so long since my body's been warm
I know I've got to make it
But I just can't take New York
(New York) I just can't take New York
I came here all dreams and wide eyes in the big, big city
No family, no money, and I don't even know what's hit me
Hit me (hit me)
Every street and every corner watch them drown
And watch them do the Crazyman Dance
(Crazyman Dance, Crazyman's Dance, Crazyman Dance)
Watch them do the Crazyman Dance
Men and Women to the slaughter
We just stand and watch them do the Crazyman Dance
(Crazyman Dance, Crazyman's Dance, Crazyman Dance)
Watch them do the Crazyman Dance
Oh no, do you.
It's been one whole year
And it's just not fair
For all the pushing and shoving
I've still got nothing
I'm never gonna make it
And I'm stuck here in New York
(New York) I'm stuck here in New York
So people don't come near
Unless you've a dollar to spare
'Cause you know what they say
About madmen on the subways of New York
Of-ha New York
(Believe it, believe it, believe it)
Yesterday's newspapers
I wrap them around my body
Outside these skyscrapers
I wait for the night to hit me
And boy, does it hit me
(New York, New York, New York)
(Just like your Ma)
(Just like your Pa)
(Just like someone you use to know)
Every street and every corner watch them drown
And watch them do the Crazyman Dance
(Crazyman Dance, Crazyman's Dance, Crazyman Dance)
Watch them do the Crazyman Dance
For a nickel or a quarter
For your pleasure watch them do the Crazyman Dance
(Crazyman Dance, Crazyman's Dance, Crazyman Dance)
Ha, watch them do the Crazyman Daye-ance
I'm coming to London
I'm coming to Paris
I'm coming to make you good clean people embarrassed
Why don't you look at my face
Why don't you look in my eyes
You'd rather look at your feet
You'd rather look at the skies
Oh, you'd look anywhere
But at a man whose pure existence
Says I ain't got time and I don't care
I don't care
You just don't care
Care, care
Don't worry about it man
Guy is crazy
Crazy
Crazy
