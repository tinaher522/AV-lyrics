<song artist="George_Michael" title="Tonight">
Tonight 
Do we have to fight again 
Tonight? 
I just want to go to sleep 
Turn out the light 
But you want to carry grudges 
Oh, nine times out of ten 
Oh, I see the storm approaching 
Long before the rain starts falling 
Tonight 
Does it have to be the old thing 
Tonight? 
Oh, it's late, too late 
To chase the rainbow that you're after 
I'd like to find a compromise 
Oh, and place it in your hands 
My eyes are blind, my ears can't hear 
Oh, and I cannot find the time 
Tonight 
Just let the curtains close in silence
Tonight 
Why not approach with less defiance 
The man who'd love to see you smile 
Who'd love to see you smile 
Tonight 
Tonight 
Just let the curtains close in silence 
Tonight 
Why not approach with less defiance 
The man who'd love to see your smile 
The man who'd love to see your smile 
The man who'd love to see your smile 
Tonight
