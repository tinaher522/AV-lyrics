<song artist="George_Michael" title="I_Want_Your_Sex_(Part_2)">
Oh so much love
That you've never seen
Let's make love
Put your trust in me
Don't you listen to what they told you
Because I love you
Let me hold you
Oh
I'm not your brother
I'm not your father
Oh will you ever change your mind
I'm a gentle lover with a heart of gold
But baby you've been so unkind...oh
Come on
I want your sex
Come on, I want your sex
That's right, all night
Oh, I want your sex
I want your...sex
Sexy baby's
(Sexy baby's)
Sexy body
(Sexy body)
Keeps me guessing
With a promise
I know we can come together
But the question is
Will we ever?
Together - you and me
