<song artist="George_Michael" title="Brother_Can_You_Spare_A_Dime">
Once I built a railroad, made it run
Made it race against time
Once I built a rairoad, now it's done
Brother can you spare a dime? 
Once I built a tower to the sun
Brick and rivet and lime
Once I built a tower, now it's done
Brother can you spare a dime? 
Once in khaki suits
Gee, we looked swell
Full of that yankee doodle de dum
Half a million boots went slogging through hell
I was the kid with the drum
Say don't you remember, they called me al
It was al all the time
Say don't you remember, I'm your pal!
Buddy can you spare a dime? 
Once I built a railroad, made it run
Made it race against time
Once I built a rairoad, now it's done
Brother can you spare a dime? 
Once I built a tower to the sun
Brick and rivet and lime
Once I built a tower, now it's done
Brother can you spare a dime? 
Once in khaki suits
Gee, we looked swell
Full of that yankee doodle de dum
Half a million boots went slogging through hell
I was the kid with the drum
Say don't you remember, they called me al
It was al all the time
Say don't you remember, I'm your pal!
Buddy can you spare a dime?
