<song artist="George_Michael" title="Star_People">
Star people
Counting your money until your soul turns green
Star people
Counting the cost of your desire to be seen
I do not count myself among you
I may be living in a dream
It's just there seems so many of you
Can't help but hope there's a difference between...
You and me
(You're a star)
I'm talking to you
And you should go far (you're a star)
I said, maybe your mama gave you up boy 
(It's the same old same old)
Maybe your daddy didn't love you enough, girl 
(How much is enough)
Star people
Never forget you're secret's safe with me, just
Look at all the wonderful people
Trying to forget they had to pay for what you see
It's a dream
With a nightmare stuck in the middle
But listen brother, where would you be
Without all of that attention
You'd die, I'd die, we'd die 
Wouldn't we?
Well wouldn't we
Big, big, star!
Should go far!
I said, maybe your mama gave you up boy
(It's the same old same old)
Maybe your daddy didn't love you enough, girl 
(How much is enough)

Talk about your mother, talk about your father
Talk about the people who have made you what you are
Talk about your teacher, the bully boy who beat you
Talk about the people who have paid for that new sports car
Did you get off on a bad foot, baby
Do you have a little tale to tell
Is that why you're a star?
Is that what makes a star?
Now, nothing comes from nothing, baby
That fame and fortune's heaven sent
And who gives a f*** about your problems, darling
When you can pay the rent
How much is enough?
