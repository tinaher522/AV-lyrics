<song artist="The_Doors" title="Love_Me_Two_Times">
Love me two time, baby 
Love me twice today
Love me two time, girl
I'm goin' away
Love me two time, girl 
One for tomorrow
One just for today
Love me two times
I'm goin' away
Love me one time
Could not speak
Love me one time
Yeah, my knees gone weak
Love me two time, girl
Last me all through the week
Love me two times
I'm goin' away
Love me two times
I'm goin' away
Oh, yeah!
Love me one time
Could not speak
Love me one time, baby
Yeah, my knees gone weak
Love me two time, girl
Last me all through the week
Love me two times
I'm goin' away
Love me two time, babe 
Love me twice today
Love me two time, babe
'Cause I'm goin' away
Love me two time, girl 
One for tomorrow
One just for today
Love me two times
I'm goin' away
Love me two times
I'm goin' away
Love me two times
I'm goin' away
