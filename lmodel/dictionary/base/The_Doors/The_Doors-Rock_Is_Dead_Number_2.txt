Now, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute. 
I want to talk to them little peoples.
Now I want to talk to them peoples
And I want to tell them how I feel.
I got a few things on my chest
And I gotta them off.
Are you ready?
Are you ready?
Now listen, listen,
Listen, listen, listen. 
Now I don't want to hear
No talk about no revolution.
And I swear to God I don't want to hear
No talk about no constitution.
And in my frame of mind
I am in no mood for no talk
About no cremation. 
The only thing I'm interested in
And this is what I want to tell ya
And this is from the heart
Now what I'm talking about, 
Now children,
Now this summer, baby
I want you to be out there in the park
Out there in the dark
I want you to have some summer
I want to see some dancin'
In the street
I want to see some prancin'
From the folks I meet
I want to have a good time
I don't want to hear no talk
About no riots
No demonstrations.
No calsitrations.
No inplabermations.
There's only one thing I wanna see.
That's some dancin'
We're gonna have some fun,
We're gonna have a good time. 
Ah, boogie.
All night long.
Let's boogie. 
All right.
Yeah. 
Rockin' little woman be my pal.
Rock a baby gonna feel alright, yeah.
Rock 'n' roll all night long
You gotta rock a little boogie 
Rock a little boogie till you boop, bop, yeah. 
You gotta feel.
Gotta feel.
Gotta beep, bop, boo.
Gotta deek, dock, doo.
You gotta love, love,
Love your baby little lotta...
Yeah, c'mon. 
Yeah, wait a minute.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Wait a minute. 
Now listen here, people.
I'm not talkin' to you
About some revolution.
And I swear to you
I ain't talkin' about no constitution 
I'm talkin' about
The death of rock 'n' roll.
And who killed it. 
I'm talkin' about the blues.
I'm talkin' about the news. 
Have you heard?
Have you heard?
Have you heard the word? 
Rock is dead.
Rock is dead.
Rock is dead. 
Now I didn't want to be the one
To lay it on ya, sweetheart. 
But I used to be a little fellow traveller.
I used to listen to my radio. 
I used to think we had the whole thing sewed up, momma.
Then I realized 
Rock and roll is dying baby. 
Now listen sweetheart,
I gonna talk to you
About no revolution.
I ain't gonna talk
About no constitution.
I ain't gonna talk
About anything we used to have.
I'm gonna talk about the summer comin'. 
Come on. 
Yeah, all right. 
Rock and roll woman, rock and roll woman.
Rock and roll woman, rock and roll woman.
Rock and roll woman. 
You gotta rock,
Rock around the clock, yeah. 
All right.
You gotta rock,
Rock around the world tonight. 
Seen everything there is to see.
Seen everything there is to be.
Love my baby all night, yeah.
Love my woman in the bright midnight.
Love my girl, feel all right. 
Come on love, love, love all baby tonight.
Yeah, love.

Ah, all right child.
