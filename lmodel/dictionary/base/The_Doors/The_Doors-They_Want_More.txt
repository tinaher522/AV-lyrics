<song artist="The_Doors" title="They_Want_More">
They want more! I guess they want more! It wasn't us, we didn't do it on the stage, it's all the audience fault. You can't blame The Doors, you have to blame the audience, you gotta blame Boston. Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright! Yeah! Would anybody like to see my genitals? Forget it! Yeah!
