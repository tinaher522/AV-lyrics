<song artist="The_Doors" title="Cars_Hiss_By_My_Window">
The cars hiss by my window
Like the waves down on the beach
The cars hiss by my window
Like the waves down on the beach
I got this girl beside me
But she's out of reach
Headlight through my window
Shinin' on the wall
Headlight through my window
Shinin' on the wall
Can't hear my baby
Though I call and call
Yeah, right
Woo!
Windows started tremblin'
With a sonic boom
Windows started tremblin'
With a sonic boom, boom
A cold girl'll kill you
In a darkened room
Yeah, woo
Ride
Ride on
Weooooo! Wawa, eooo! Oooo, owa, owaaa! Wa, waaaaea! Ooo, wa, wa, wa, wa, waa!
