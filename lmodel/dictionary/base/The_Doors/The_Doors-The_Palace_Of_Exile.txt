<song artist="The_Doors" title="The_Palace_Of_Exile">
For seven years I dwelt
In the loose palace of exile,
Playing strange games
With the girls of the island.
Now I have come again
To the land of the fair, and the strong, and the wise.
Brothers and sisters of the pale forest
Children of night
Who among you will run with the hunt? 
Now night arrives with her purple legion.
Retire now to your tents and to your dreams.
Tomorrow we enter the town of my birth.
I want to be ready.
The doors! the doors!
We're out of time, thank you very much. we're out of time.
All right, we've got time for one more, let's do it one more time.
