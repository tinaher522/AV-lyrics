<song artist="The_Doors" title="Yes,_The_River_Knows">
Please believe me
The river told me
Very softly
Want you to hold me
Free fall flow river, flow
On and on it goes
Breathe under water till the end
Yes, the river knows
Please, believe me
If you don't need me
I'm going
But I need a little time
I promised I would drown myself
In mystic heated wine
Please believe me
The river told me
Very softly
Want you to hold me
I'm going but I need a little time
I promised I would drown myself
In mystic heated wine
Free fall river, flow
On and on it goes
Breathe under water till the end
