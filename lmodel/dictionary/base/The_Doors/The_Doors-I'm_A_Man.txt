<song artist="The_Doors" title="I'm_A_Man">
I was a young boy.
I was just about five.
I had a thing in my pocket,
I kept alive.
Now I'm a man.
I'm past twenty-one.
You know baby,
We have a lot of fun.
Yeah, I'm a man.
No boy.
Listen here.
What I'm sayin'.
I know
What's going down.
All you people,
Shut those discos down.
Well I'm a man.
And so are these other guys.
I got three men with me,
And they know where it's at.
Got some young studs.
And we're nothing but love
Everyday
And everyone.
We're grown up.
We're taking it on.
All you people,
Try holdin' on.
Come with us.
We'll take over the world.
We're gonna own it.
Make it like we want it.
You got to feel it in your hand.
You got to understand.
You got to come along.
I'm telling you to grow up fast.
I'm telling you to grow up now.
I'm telling ya you ain't no children.
I'm telling ya you're not little girls.
I'm telling ya you're not little boys.
You're men, don't you understand.
You're women, don't you understand.
You men and women.
Get together.
Hold your hands.
We're gonna take it over.
With a girl by your side.
And a woman has her man.
There's nothing they can't stop.
They own it, you own it.
How do you want it to be?
Do you like it the way it is?
You want to be something?
You want them to be good?
Want them to love?
You want all the things.
When I get high he tells me that.
I think I'm gonna love.
I want to touch you everyone.
I want to touch you down there.
I want to know you.
I want to feel you.
I want to feed you.
I want you to know me.
I want you to feel me.
And we're all right here.
What are we gonna do with it?
We're gonna ---
Are we gonna be something.
Or are we gonna let it fall apart.
Are we gonna let them take it?
Or are we gonna take it?
Are we gonna take it?
And make it something great, you know.
And make it something beautiful.
And make it what we want.
And make it something we need.
So you realize.
So you realize.
So you feel.
So you know the deal.
So you ---
So you feel the groove.
So you don't stop.
I'm telling you you're gods.
You people are gods.
You're all gods here.
We're all gods here.
We own the universe.
We own the stars.
We own the sky.
We own the world.
We own it all.
---
Come on let's get it.
Come on let's get it.
