<song artist="The_Doors" title="Talking_Blues">
Yeah
How, me and my baby walking down the street
We's being friendly to person we meet - you know that
Yeah
Say "Hi neighbor. Howya doin'. Hey Dylan. How you doin' babe"
How, where you goin' boy?
How, what's happenin' out there?
We gotta whole lotta love baby
I gotta whole lotta love baby
Come on
