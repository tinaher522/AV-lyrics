<song artist="The_Doors" title="Bird_Of_Prey">
Bird of Prey, bird of Prey
Flying high, flying high
In the summer sky
Bird of Prey, bird of Prey
Flying high, flying high
Gently pass on by
Bird of Prey, bird of Prey
Flying high, flying high
Am I going to die?
Bird of Prey, bird of Prey
Flying high, flying high
Take me on your flight
