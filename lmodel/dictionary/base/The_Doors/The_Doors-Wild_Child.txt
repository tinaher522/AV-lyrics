<song artist="The_Doors" title="Wild_Child">
All right
Wild child, full of grace
Savior of the human race
Your cruel face
Natural child, terrible child
Not your mother's or your father's child
You're our child, screamin' wild
An ancient lunatic reigns
In the trees of the night
Ha ha ha ha
With hunger at her heels
Freedom in her eyes
She dances on her knees
Pirate prince at her side
Starin' into the hollow idol's eye
Wild child, full of grace
Savior of the human race
Your cruel face
Your cruel face
Your cruel face
You remember when we were in Africa?
