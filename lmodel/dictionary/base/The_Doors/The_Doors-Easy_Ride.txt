<song artist="The_Doors" title="Easy_Ride">
And I know
It will be
An easy ride, all right
And I know
It will be
Easy ride, okay
The mask that you wore
My fingers would explore
Costume of control
Excitement soon unfolds
And I know
It will be
Easy ride, yeah
Joy, for vaguely
With your pride
With your pride, yeah
Black polished stone
Black polished stone
I see your eyes
Like burnin' glass
Like burnin' glass
Hear you smile, smile, babe
The mask that you wore
My fingers would explore
Costume of control
Excitement soon unfolds, hey
Easy, baby
Call the queen, now
Be my bride
Ragin' darkness
By my side
Seize the summer
In your pride
Take the winter
In your stride
Let's ride, yeah
Easy, easy, easy
Easy, easy, ease, easy
Yeah, yeah, ride
Dum, dum, dum, dum
Dum, dum, dum
Oh, ride
