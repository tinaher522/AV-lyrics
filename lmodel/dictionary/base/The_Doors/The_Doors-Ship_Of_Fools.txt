<song artist="The_Doors" title="Ship_Of_Fools">
The human race was dying out
No one left to scream and shout
People walking on the moon
Smog will get you pretty soon
Everyone was hangin' out
Hangin' up and hangin' down
Hangin' in and holdin' fast
Hope our little world will last
Along came Mister Goodtrips
Looking for a new a ship
Come on, people, better climb on board
Come on, baby, now we're going home
Ship of fools
Ship of fools
The human race was dying out
No one left to scream and shout
People walking on the moon
Smog will get you pretty soon
Ship of fools
Ship of fools
Ship of fools
Ship of fools
Ship of fools
Ship of fools
Ship of fools
Yeah, climb on board
Ship's gonna leave ya far behind
Climb on board
Ship of fools
Ship of fools
