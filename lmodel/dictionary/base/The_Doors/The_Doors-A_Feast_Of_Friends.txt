<song artist="The_Doors" title="A_Feast_Of_Friends">
Wow, I'm sick of doubt 
Live in the light of certain south 
Cruel bindings 
The servants have the power 
dog-men and their mean women 
pulling poor blankets over our sailors 
I'm sick of dour faces 
Staring at me from the T.V. tower
I want roses in my garden bower, dig? 
Royal babies, rubies 
must now replace aborted strangers in the mud 
These mutants, 
blood-meal for the plant that's plowed 
They are waiting to take us 
into the severed garden.
Do you know how pale and wanton thrillful 
comes death on a stranger hour 
unannounced, unplanned for 
like a scaring over-friendly guest 
you've brought to bed 
Death makes angels of us all 
and gives us wings 
where we had shoulders 
smooth as raven's claws 
No more money, no more fancy dress 
This other kingdom seems by far the best 
until its other jaw reveals incest 
and loose obedience to a vegetable law 
I will not go 
Prefer a feast of friends to the giant family
