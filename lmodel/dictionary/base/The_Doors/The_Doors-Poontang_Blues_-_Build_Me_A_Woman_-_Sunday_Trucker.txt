<song artist="The_Doors" title="Poontang_Blues_-_Build_Me_A_Woman_-_Sunday_Trucker">
I've got the poontang blues
From the top of my hip
To my cowboy shoes
Whole lotta money
Nothing to lose
I've got the poontang blues
Give me a witness, darling.
I need a witness, babe.
I got the poontang blues. I got the poontang blues.
From the top of my head to the bottom of my cowboy shoes.
Build me a woman,
Make her ten feet tall.
You got to build me a woman,
Make her ten feet tall.
Don't make her worthless,
Don't make her small.
Build me a woman,
Make her ten feet tall.
You got to build me a woman,
Make her ten feet tall.
Don't make her worthless,
Don't make her small.
Build me someone I can ball
All night long.
Sunday trucker
Christian motherf**ker
Yeaheah
Well I'm a sunday trucker
Christian motherf**ker
Yeah
I'm just a three-eyes boy
Looking for a trip,
So good
