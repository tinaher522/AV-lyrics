Alright... would all of you people in front kind of sit down so the people in the back who have nice seats can kinda see. And by the way, tonight's performance is being recorded by Electra Records, I dunno what for, but I imagine they're possibly including it on an album. So when you cheer, make it nice and loud. Ladies and gentlemen, The Doors!
Well, gonna have some fun tonight, baby.
