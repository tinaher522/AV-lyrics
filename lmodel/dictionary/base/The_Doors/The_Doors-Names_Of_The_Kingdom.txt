<song artist="The_Doors" title="Names_Of_The_Kingdom">
We came down
The rivers and highways
We came down from
Forests and falls
We came down from
Carson and Springfield
We came down from
Phoenix enthralled
And I can tell you
The names of the Kingdom
I can tell you
The things that you know
Listening for a fistful of silence
Climbing valleys into the shade
'I am the Lizard King
I can do anything
I can make the earth stop in its tracks
I made the blue cars go away
