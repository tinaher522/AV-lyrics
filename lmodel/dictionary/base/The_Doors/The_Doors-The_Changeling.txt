<song artist="The_Doors" title="The_Changeling">
Uh! Uhh! Gedu!
I live uptown
I live downtown
I live all around
I had money, I had none
I had money, I had none
But I never been so broke that I couldn't leave town
I'm a changeling
See me change
I'm a changeling
See me change
I'm the air you breathe
Food you eat
Friends you greet in the sullen street, wow!
See me change
See me change
Get loose!
I live uptown
I live downtown
I live all around
I had money, yeah, I had none
I had money, yeah, and I had none
But I never been so broke that I couldn't leave town
Well, I'm the air you breathe
Food you eat
Friends you greet in the sullen street, wow! Ew, ma! Uh, ah!
You gotta see me change
See me change
Yeah, I'm leavin' town
On a midnight train
Gotta see me change
Change, change, change
Change, change, change
Change, change, change
Change, change, change
Woa, change, change, change
