<song artist="The_Doors" title="Moonlight_Drive">
Let's swim to the moon
Uh-huh
Let's climb thru the tide
Penetrate the evenin' that the city sleeps to hide
Let's swim out tonight, love
It's our turn to try
Parked beside the ocean
On our moonlight drive
Let's swim to the moon
Uh-huh
Let's climb thru the tide
Surrender to the waiting worlds that lap against our side
Nothing left open
And no time to decide
We've stepped into a river
On our moonlight drive
Let's swim to the moon
Let's climb thru the tide
You reach a hand to hold me
But I can't be your guide
Easy to love you as I watch you glide
Falling through wet forests
On our moonlight drive
Moonlight drive
C'mon, baby, gonna take a little ride
Goin' down by the ocean side
Gonna get real close
Get real tight
Baby gonna drown tonight
Goin' down, down, down
