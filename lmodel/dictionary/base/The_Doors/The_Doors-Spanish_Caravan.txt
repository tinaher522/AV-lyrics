<song artist="The_Doors" title="Spanish_Caravan">
Carry me
Caravan
Take me away
Take me to Portugal
Take me to Spain
Andalusia
With fields of grain
I have to see you
Again and again
Take me
Spanish caravan
Yes
I know you can
Tradewinds find galleons
Lost in the sea
I know where treasures
Is waiting for me
Silver and gold
The mountains of Spain
I have to see you
Again and again
Take me
Spanish caravan
Yes
I know you can
