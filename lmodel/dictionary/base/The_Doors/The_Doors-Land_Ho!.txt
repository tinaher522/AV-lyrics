<song artist="The_Doors" title="Land_Ho!">
Grandma loved a sailor who sailed the frozen sea
Grandpa was that whaler and he took me on his knee
He said, "Son, I'm goin' crazy from livin' on the land
Got to find my shipmates and walk on foreign sands."
This old man was graceful, with silver in his smile
He smoked a briar pipe and he walked for country miles
Singing songs of shady sisters and old-time liberty
Songs of love and songs of death and songs to set men free
I've got three ships and sixty men
A course for ports unread
I'll stand at mast, let north winds blow
Till half of us are dead
Land ho!
Well, if I get my hands on a dollar bill
Gonna buy a bottle and drink my fill
If I get my hands on a number five
Gonna skin that little girl alive
If I get my hands on a number two
Come back home and marry you
Marry you
Marry you
All right!
Yeah, land ho
Yeah, land ho
Well, if I get back home
And I feel all right
You know I'm gonna love you tonight
Love tonight
Love tonight
Yeah, land ho!
