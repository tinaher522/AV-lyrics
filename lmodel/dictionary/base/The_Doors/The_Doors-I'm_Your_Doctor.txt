<song artist="The_Doors" title="I'm_Your_Doctor">
Headache strike you, baby
You begin to feel so glun
Ain't nothin' you need
But a double dose of love
Woman, I'm your doctor
And oh yes, I know just what you need
Let me see your credentials
I got my doctor's certificate
PHD or MD or RX?
I got it right here in my pants
Show it to me
Listen here, baby
You're not feelin' so good
I know what you need
Double dose of love
Woman, I'm your doctor, prove it
And I know what you need
You need a hot-beef injection
And whoa yes, it have to come from me
Is that like gettn' a hot dick?
You wake up in the mornin'
Girl, you're not feelin' so good
You need a man to love you
Just like you knew you would
Listen baby, well I'm your doctor
And I know what you need
You need a Polish sausage
Whoa yeah, baby, have to come from me
