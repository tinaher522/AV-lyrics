<song artist="The_Doors" title="Black_Polished_Chrome">
The music was new 
Black polished chrome 
And came over the summer 
Like liquid night
The DJ's took pills to stay awake 
And play for seven days
They went to the studio 
And someone knew him
Someone knew the TV showman.
He came to our homeroom party 
And played records
And when he left in the hot noon sun 
And walked to his car
We saw the chooks had written 
F-U-C-K on his windshield
He wiped it off with a white rag 
And smiling coolly drove away
He's rich, got a big car
