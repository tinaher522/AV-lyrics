<song artist="The_Doors" title="Rock_Me_Number_1">
Come on and rock me, baby.
Rock me all night long.
Rock me little darling.
Rock me all night long.
Rock me baby,
Like my back ain't got no bone.
You see the sun go down,
Little moon begin to rise.
You see the sun go down,
Little moon begin to rise.
Come on and rock me, sweetheart.
Rock me till I'm satisfied.
Oh come on, rock me.
All right, how many of you people
Want to get rocked tonight?
Yeah, the sun go down.
Yeah, throw your arms 
Around me darling.
Like a circle around the sun.
Come on and rock me
Like I'm the only one.
All right let's rock a while.
Come on get down.
Rock me one more time.
Come on and rock me, little darling.
Rock me all night long.
Come on and rock me, little darling.
Rock me all night long.
You gotta rock me all night long.
Yeah!
