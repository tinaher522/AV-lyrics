<song artist="The_Doors" title="Heartbreak_Hotel">
Since my baby left me,
I found a new place to dwell.
It's down at the end of lonely street,
That's -
You feel so lonely, baby.
I am so lonely.
Feel so lonely,
I could die.
Although it's always crowded,
You still can find some room.
For broken-hearted lovin'
Is to cry back in your gloom.
I feel so lonely, baby.
So lonely.
Feel so lonely,
I could die.
Although it's always crowded,
You still can find some room.
For broken-hearted lovin'
Is to cry back in your gloom.
Feel so lonely.
Feel so lonely.
Well I feel so lonely,
I could die.
