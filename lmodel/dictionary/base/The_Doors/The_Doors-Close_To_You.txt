<song artist="The_Doors" title="Close_To_You">
Ah, ladies and gentlemen,
I don't know if you realize it,
but tonight you're in for a special treat.
No, no, no, not that, not that!
You only get that treat on full moons.
Besides, I know there's a lot of young people here,
and I would want anybody to faint or blush or anything like that.
The last time it happened, grown men where weeping.
Policemen where turning in their badges.
Oh, I get it, I get it, everyone was intimidated tonight by all the security precautions in here, oh.
Well, just remember their motto is "Protect and Serve".
I wanna get
Close to you baby like black on white,
Close to you baby like cold is to ice,
Close to you baby like a Siamese twin,
Close to you baby like I'm feeling all right.
I wanna get
Close to you baby,
Well, close to you baby,
Close to you baby,
I don't know what to say or do.
I wanna get
Close to you baby like the sight of your eye
Close to you baby like the heat is to fire,
Close to you baby close as I can get,
Close to you baby like water is wet.
I wanna get
Close to you baby.
I said close to you baby.
Close to you baby.
Don't know what to say or do.
I wanna get
Close to you baby till I'm feeling all right,
Close to you baby gonna love you all night,
Close to you baby in New York city,
I love you so much, woman, you know it's a pity.
I wanna get
Close to you baby.
I said close to you baby.
Close to you baby.
Don't know what to say or do.
Well
I wanna get closer and closer baby
Closer and closer babe
Closer and closer babe
Closer and closer baby
I wanna close to you baby
That I don't know what to say or do.
Well, closer and closer baby
Closer and closer baby
Closer and closer baby
Closer and closer baby
I wanna close to you baby
Oh baby!
We love you!
And you make me feel all right
Make me feel all right
Make Robbie feel all right
And you make John feel all right
And make Jim feel all right
And we wanna love you so much to you
I don't know what to say or do
All right
