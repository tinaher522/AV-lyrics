<song artist="The_Doors" title="Maggie_M'Gill">
Miss Maggie M'Gill, she lived on a hill
Her daddy got drunk and left her no will
So she went down, down to "Tangie Town"
People down there really like to get it on
Now, if you're sad and you're feelin' blue
Go out and buy a brand new pair of shoes
And you go down, down to "Tangie Town"
The people down there really like to get it on
Get it on
Illegitimate son of a rock 'n' roll star
Illegitimate son of a rock 'n' roll star
Mom met dad in the back of a rock 'n' roll car
Yeah
Well, I'm an old blues man and I think that you understand
I've been singing the blues ever since the world began
Maggie
Maggie
Maggie M'Gill
Roll on
Roll on
Maggie M'Gill
Maggie
Maggie
Maggie M'Gill
Roll on
Roll on
Maggie M'Gill
