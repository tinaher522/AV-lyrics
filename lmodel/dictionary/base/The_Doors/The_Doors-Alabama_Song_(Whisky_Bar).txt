Oh, show me the way to the next whiskey bar
Oh, don't ask why
Oh, don't ask why
Show me the way to the next whiskey bar
Oh, don't ask why
Oh, don't ask why
For if we don't find the next whiskey bar
I tell you we must die
I tell you we must die
I tell you, I tell you
I tell you we must die
Oh, moon of Alabama
We now must say goodbye
We've lost our good old mama
Man must have whiskey, or you know why
Oh, moon of Alabama
We now must say goodbye
We've lost our good old mama
Man must have whiskey, or you know why, yeah
Oh, show me the way to the next little girl
Oh, don't ask why
Oh, don't ask why
Show me the way to the next little girl
Oh, don't ask why
Oh, don't ask why
For if we don't find the next little girl
I tell you we must die
I tell you we must die
I tell you, I tell you
I tell you we must die
Oh, moon of Alabama
We now must say goodbye
We've lost our good old mama
Man must have whiskey, or you know why
