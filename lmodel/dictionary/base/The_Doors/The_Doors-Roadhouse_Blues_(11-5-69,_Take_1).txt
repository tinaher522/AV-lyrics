Money beats soul every time, come on
Money beats soul every time
You know that money beats soul every time
Ladies and gentlemen
On this stage for the very first time in the western world
We have
Money beats soul every time, come on
Waaaaaooh
Keep your eyes on the road, your hands upon the wheel
Keep your eyes on the road, your hands upon the wheel
Yeah, we're goin' to the roadhouse
We're gonna have a real
Good time
Yeah, back at the roadhouse they got some bungalows
Yeah, back at the roadhouse they got some bungalows
That's for the people
Who like to go down slow
Let it roll, baby, roll
Let it roll, baby, roll
Let it roll, baby, roll
Let it roll, all night long
Waaaaaooh
Yeah, I woke up this morning, I got myself a beer
Woke up this morning and I got myself a beer
Yeah, the future's uncertain and the end is always near
Let it roll, baby, roll
Let it roll, baby, roll
Let it roll, baby, roll
Let it roll, all night long
