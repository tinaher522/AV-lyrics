<song artist="The_Doors" title="Moonlight_Drive_-_Demo_Recorded_At_World_Pacific_Studios,_1965">
Let's swim to the moon
Let's climb through the tide
Penetrate the evening
That the city sleeps to hide
Let's swim out tonight, love
It's our turn to try
Parked beside the ocean
On our moonlight drive
Let's swim to the moon
Let's climb through the tide
Surrender to the waiting worlds
That lap against our side
Nothing left open
And no time to decide.
We've stepped into a river
On our moonlight drive
Let's swim to the moon
Let's climb through the tide
You reach a hand to hold me
But I can't be your guide
It's easy to love you
As I watch you glide
We're falling through wet forests
On our moonlight drive
Come on, baby, gonna take a little ride
Going' down by the ocean side
Gonna get real close, get real tight
Baby gonna drown tonight
Going' down, down, down
