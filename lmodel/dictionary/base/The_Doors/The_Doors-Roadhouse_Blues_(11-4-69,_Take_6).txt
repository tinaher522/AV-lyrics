<song artist="The_Doors" title="Roadhouse_Blues_(11-4-69,_Take_6)">
Yeah, a keep your eyes on the road your hands upon the wheel
Keep your eyes on the road your hands upon the wheel
Yeah, we're goin' to the roadhouse we're gonna have a real, a good time
Yeah at the back at the roadhouse they got some bungalows
Yeah at the back at the roadhouse they got some bungalows
And that's for the people who like to go down slow
Let it roll, baby roll
Let it roll, baby roll
Let it roll, baby roll
Let it roll, all night long
Do it, Robbie, do it
You gotta roll, roll, roll
You gotta thrill my soul, all right
Roll, roll, roll, roll and thrill my soul
You gotta beep a gunk a chucha
Honk konk konk
You gotta each you puna
Each ya bop a luba
Each y'all bump a kechonk
Ease sum konk, ya, ride
Ashen lady, ashen lady
Give up your vows, give up your vows
Save our city, save our city
Right now
Well, I woke up this morning and I got myself a beer
Well, I woke up this morning and I got myself a beer
The future's uncertain and the end is always near
Let it roll, baby roll
Let it roll, baby roll
Let it roll, baby roll
Let it roll, all night long
