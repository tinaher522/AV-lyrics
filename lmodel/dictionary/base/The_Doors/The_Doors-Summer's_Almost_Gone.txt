<song artist="The_Doors" title="Summer's_Almost_Gone">
Summer's almost gone
Summer's almost gone
Almost gone
Yeah
It's almost gone
Where will we be
When the summer's gone?
Morning found us calmly unaware
Noon burned gold into our hair
At night we swam the laughing sea
When summer's gone
Where will we be?
Where will we be?
Where will we be?
Morning found us calmly unaware
Noon burned gold into our hair
At night we swam the laughing sea
When summer's gone
Where will we be?
Summer's almost gone
Summer's almost gone
We had some good times
But they're gone
The winter's coming on
Summer's almost gone
