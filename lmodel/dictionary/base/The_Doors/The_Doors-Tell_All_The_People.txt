<song artist="The_Doors" title="Tell_All_The_People">
Tell all the people that you see
Follow me
Follow me down
Tell all the people that you see
Set them free
Follow me down
You tell them they don't have to run
We're gonna pick up everyone
Come on, take me by my hand
Gonna bury all our troubles in the sand
Oh yeah
Can't you see the wonder at your feet?
Your life's complete
Follow me down
Can't you see me growing? Get your guns
The time has come
To follow me down
Follow me across the sea
Where milky babies seem to be
Molded, flowing revelry
With the one that set them free
Tell all the people that you see
It's just me
Follow me down
Tell all the people that you see
Follow me
Follow me down
Tell all the people that you see
We'll be free
Follow me down
Tell all the people that you see
It's just me
Follow me down
Tell all the people that you see
Follow me
Follow me down
Follow me down
You got to follow me down
Follow me down
Tell all the people that you see
We'll be free
Follow me down
Tell all the people that you see
Follow me
Follow me down
