<song artist="The_Doors" title="An_American_Prayer">
Do you know the warm progress under the stars? 
Do you know we exist? 
Have you forgotten the keys to the kingdom?
Have you been borne yet &amp; are you alive? 
Let's reinvent the gods, all the myths of the ages 
Celebrate symbols from deep elder forests 
Have you forgotten the lessons of the ancient war 
We need great golden copulations 
The fathers are cackling in trees of the forest 
Our mother is dead in the sea 
Do you know we are being led to slaughters 
By placid admirals &amp; that fat slow generals are getting 
Obscene on young blood 
Do you know we are ruled by T.V. 
The moon is dry blood beast 
Guerrilla bands are rolling numbers 
In the next block of green vine 
Amassing for warfare on innocent 
Herdsman who are just dying 
O great creator of being 
Grant us one more hour to perform our art 
And perfect our lives 
The moths and atheists are doubly divine and dying 
We live, we die and death not ends it 
Journey we more into the nightmare 
Cling to life our passion'd flower 
Cling to cunts and cocks of despair 
We got our final vision by clap 
Columbus groin got filled with green death 
I touched her thigh, death smiled
We have assembled inside this ancient 
And insane theater 
To propagate our lust for life 
And flee the swarming wisdom of the streets 
The barns are stormed, 
The windows kept 
And only one of all the rest 
To dance and save us 
With the divine mockery of words
Music inflames temperament
When the true King's murderers 
Are allowed to roam free 
A 1000 Magicians arise in the land
Where are the feasts we are promised 
Where is the wine, the new wine 
Dying on the vine
