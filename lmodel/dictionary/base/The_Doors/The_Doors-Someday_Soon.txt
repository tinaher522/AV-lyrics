<song artist="The_Doors" title="Someday_Soon">
Someday soon
Someday soon
Familiar freaks will fill your living room
Rugs lash out there lizard tongues
Your not getting young
Your not getting young
But your going to die
And your going to be needing all of your eyes
You'll be all alone
When the cannibals cry
All by your self
Inside infancy's lie
Someday soon
Someday soon
Television bleeding like a harvest moon
Flush the scissors down the hole
Your getting old
Your getting old
And I hate to remind you but your going to die
And your going to be needing all of your lies
You'll be all alone
When the cannibals cry 
All by yourself
Inside infancy's lie
Someday soon
Someday soon
Someday soon
Someday soon
