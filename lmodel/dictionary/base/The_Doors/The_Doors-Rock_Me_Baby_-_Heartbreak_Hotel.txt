<song artist="The_Doors" title="Rock_Me_Baby_-_Heartbreak_Hotel">
I want you to rock me baby, rock me all night long
Rock me baby, rock me all night long
I want you to rock me baby
'Til my back ain't got no bone
Go 'head, Jim!
Roll me baby, softer, sweetheart
Just slow it down
I got to tell you somethin'
You gotta slow it down, yeah
Got softer
You gotta rock me baby, rock me all night long
Rock me baby, darlin', rock me all night long
Rock me mama, 'til I in my song
Well, since my baby left me, well I've found a new house to dwell
Since my baby left me, found a brand new house to dwell
Out on the end of Tomorrow Street, and I wish her well
One more
Want you to rock me pretty baby, rock me all night long
Want you to rock me pretty baby, rock me all night long
Want you to rock me mama, all night long
Hey, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute
We got time for one more song, whaddaya guys wanna hear?
