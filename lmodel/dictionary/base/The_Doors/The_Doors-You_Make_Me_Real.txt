<song artist="The_Doors" title="You_Make_Me_Real">
I really want you
Really do
Really need you, baby
God knows I do
'Cause I'm not real enough without you
Oh, what can I do?
You make me real
You make me feel
Like lovers feel
You make me throw away mistake and misery
Make me free, love
Make me free
I really want you
Really do
Really need you, baby
Really do
I'm not real enough without you
Oh, what can I do?
You make me real
Only you, baby
Have that appeal
So let me slide into your tender sunken sea
Make me free, love
Make me free
Roll now, baby, roll
Well, roll now, baby, roll
You gotta roll now, baby, roll
Roll now, honey, roll
You gotta roll now, baby, roll
Make me real
You make me real
You make me feel
Like lovers feel
You make me throw away mistake and misery
Make me free, love
Make me free
Make me free
You make me free
