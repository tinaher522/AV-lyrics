<song artist="The_Doors" title="Lament">
Lament for my cock 
Sore and crucified 
I seek to know you 
Aquiring soulful wisdom 
You can open walls of mystery 
Stripshow 
How to aquire death in the morning show 
TV death which the child absorbs 
Deathwell mystery which makes me write 
Slow train, the death of my cock gives life 
Forgive the poor old people who gave us entry 
Taught us god in the child's praye in the night 
Guitar player 
Ancient wise satyr 
Sing your ode to my cock 
Caress it's lament 
Stiffen and guide us, we frozen 
Lost cells 
The knowledge of cancer 
To speak to the heart 
And give the great gift 
Words Power Trance 
this stable friend and the beast of his zoo 
Wild haired chicks 
Women flowering in their summit 
Monsters of skin 
Each color connects 
to create the boat 
which rocks the race 
Could any hell be more horrible 
than now 
and real? 
I pressed her thigh and death smiled 
death, old friend 
death and my cock are the world 
I can forgive my injuries in the name of 
Wisdom Luxury Romance 
Sentence upon sentence 
Words are the healing lament 
For the death of my cock's spirit 
Has no meaning in the soft fire 
Words got me the wound and will get me well 
I you believe it 
All join now and lament the death of my cock 
A tounge of knowledge in the feathered night 
Boys get crazy in the head and suffer 
I sacrifice my cock on the alter of silence
