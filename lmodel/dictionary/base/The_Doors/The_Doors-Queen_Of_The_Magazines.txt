<song artist="The_Doors" title="Queen_Of_The_Magazines">
All right, all right, all right.
All right, come on.
Baby love me.
Baby, she can't care.
Baby love me.
Baby, she cannot care.
Well I wanna tell ya.
She was seventeen.
She was perfect.
Queen of the magazines.
She doesn't care,
What she did.
She didn't give a damn,
What she did.
She was my woman, seventeen.
She was the queen of the magazines, oh right.
I don't know what to tell ya.
She was so good.
Used to feel, 
Like I thought she would.
