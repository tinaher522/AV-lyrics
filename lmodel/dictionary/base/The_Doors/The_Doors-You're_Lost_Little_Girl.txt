<song artist="The_Doors" title="You're_Lost_Little_Girl">
You're lost, little girl
You're lost, little girl
You're lost
Tell me who are you
Think that you know what to do
Impossible, yes
But it's true
Think that you know what to do
Yeah
(I am) Sure that you know what to do
You're lost, little girl
You're lost, little girl
You're lost
Tell me who are you
Think that you know what to do
Impossible, yes
But it's true
I think that you know what to do
Girl
(I am) Sure that you know what to do
You're lost, little girl
You're lost, little girl
You're lost
