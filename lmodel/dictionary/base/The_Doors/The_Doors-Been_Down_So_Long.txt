<song artist="The_Doors" title="Been_Down_So_Long">
Well, I been down so goddamn long
That it looks like up to me
Well, I been down so very damn long
That it looks like up to me
Yeah, why don't one you people
Come on and set me free?
I said "Warden, warden, warden
Won't you break your lock and key?"
I said "Warden, warden, warden
Won't you break your lock and key?"
Yeah, come along here, mister
Come on and let the poor boy be
Baby, baby, baby
Won't you get down on your knees?
Baby, baby, baby
Oh, won't you get down on your knees?
Come on little darlin'
Come on and give your love to me, oh yeah
Well, I been down so goddamn long
That it looks like up to me
Well, I been down so very damn long
That it looks like up to me
Yeah, why don't one you people
Come on, come on, come on and set me free?
