<song artist="The_Doors" title="Five_To_One">
Five to one, baby
One in five
No one here gets out alive
Now
You get yours, baby
I'll get mine
Gonna make it, baby
If we try
The old get old and the young get stronger
May take a week and it may take longer
They got the guns but we got the numbers
Gonna win
Yeah, we're takin' over
Come on
Your ballroom days are over, baby
Night is drawing near
Shadows of the evening crawl across the years
You walk across the floor with a flower in your hand
Trying to tell me no one understands
Trade in your hours for a handful of dimes
Gonna make it, baby
In our prime
Get together one more time
Get together one more time
Get together one more time
Get together one more time
Get together one more time
Well, c'mon, honey
Get along home and wait for me
Baby, I'll be home in just a little while
Y'see, I gotta go out in this car with these people
And get fucked up
Get together one more time
Get together one more time
Get together, gotta get together
Gotta get together, got to
Take you up in the mountains
Ha, ha, ha, ha
Love my girl
She's lookin' good
Lookin' real good
C'mon love ya
Feel, hey
Come on
