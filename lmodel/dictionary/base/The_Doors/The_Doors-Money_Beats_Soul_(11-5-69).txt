<song artist="The_Doors" title="Money_Beats_Soul_(11-5-69)">
Yeah, I got something to tell you 'bout your soul
Your soul ain't worth shit, mama
You know how much your soul's worth?
Your soul's worth about as much as you can get on Wall Street, my dear
Now you may think I'm cynical and dangerous to tell you that
You may think that I'm a little hard to take
Ha Ha, damn
But listen doll, I'm telling you the God damned truth
Aahh
