<song artist="The_Doors" title="Rock_Me_(Live)">
Want you to rock me,
Rock me all night long.
Rock me baby,
Rock me all night long.
Want you to rock me,
Till I sing my song.
See the sun goin' down,
Moon began to rise.
See the sun goin' down,
Moon began to rise.
Want you to rock me,
Till I'm satisfied.
Let's rock a while.
Sun goin' down,
Little moon began to rise.
Sun go down,
Little moon begin to rise.
Want you to rock me, little darlin',
Till I'm satisfied.
Let's rock a while.
See me comin' momma,
Bring out that old rockin' chair.
See me comin' momma,
Bring out your rockin' chair.
No one's watching us
And God knows no one cares.
One more time.
Come on and rock me, pretty baby,
Rock me all night long.
Rock me baby,
Rock me all night long.
You gotta rock me, little woman,
Rock me all night long.
