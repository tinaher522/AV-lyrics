Thoughts in time and out of season 
the Hitchhiker stood by the side of the road 
and leveled his thumb 
in the calm calculus of reason.
Hi. How you doin'? 
I just got back into town 
L.A.?
I was out on the desert for a while.
»Riders on the storm«
Yeah. 
Oh. 
In the middle of it.
»Riders on the storm«
Right... 
»Into this world we're born« 
Hey, listen, man, I really got a problem 
»Into this world we're thrown«
When I was out on the desert, 
ya know 
»Like a dog without a bone 
an actor out on loan«
I don't know how to tell you 
»Riders on the storm«
But, ah, 
I killed somebody 
»There's a killer on the road« 
No... 
»His brain is squirming like a toad«
It's no big deal, ya know 
I don't think anybody will find out about it,
»take a long holiday« 
but just, ah... 
»Let your children play«
Ya know,
this guy gave me a ride, 
and I 
»If you give this man a ride«
started giving me a lot of trouble and I just
»Sweet family will die«
couldn't take it, ya know 
»Killer on the road«
Wasted. 
»Yeah«
