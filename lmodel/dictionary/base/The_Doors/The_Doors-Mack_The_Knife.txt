<song artist="The_Doors" title="Mack_The_Knife">
Well the shark has pretty teeth, dear
And he shows them pearly white.
But MacHeath, dear, is a sailor
And he keeps them out of sight.
Ha, huh, huh.
You know he keeps them out of sight, hmm yeah.
They're white, white, white,
White, white, white,
White, white, white, yeah.
