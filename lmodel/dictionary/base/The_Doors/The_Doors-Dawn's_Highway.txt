<song artist="The_Doors" title="Dawn's_Highway">
Me and my -ah- mother and father 
and a Grandmother and a grandfather
were driving through the desert at dawn. 
And a truck load of indian workers had 
either hit another car, or just 
I don't know what happened.
But, there were Indians scattered
all over the highway, bleeding to death.
So the car pulls up and stops. 
That was the first timeI tasted fear. 
I musta' been about four
like a child is like a flower, 
his head is just floating in the breeze, man.
The reaction I get now thinking about it, looking back 
is that the souls of the ghosts of those dead indians
maybe one or two of them
were just running around, freaking out 
and just leaped into my soul. 
And they're still...
