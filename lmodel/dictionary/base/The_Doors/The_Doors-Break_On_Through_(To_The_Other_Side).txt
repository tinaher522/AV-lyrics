<song artist="The_Doors" title="Break_On_Through_(To_The_Other_Side)">
You know the day destroys the night
Night divides the day
Tried to run
Tried to hide
Break on through to the other side
Break on through to the other side
Break on through to the other side, yeah
We chased our pleasures here
Dug our treasures there
A-can you still recall
Time we cried?
Break on through to the other side
Break on through to the other side
Hey!
Come on!
Yeah
Everybody loves my baby
Everybody loves my baby
She get high
She get high
She get high
She get high, yeah
I found an island in your arms
Country in your eyes
Arms that chained us
Eyes that lied
Break on through to the other side
Break on through to the other side
Break on through, ow!
Aw yeah!
Made the scene, week to week
Day to day, hour to hour
Gate is straight
Deep and wide
Break on through to the other side
Break on through to the other side
Break on through, break on through
Break on through, break on through
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah
