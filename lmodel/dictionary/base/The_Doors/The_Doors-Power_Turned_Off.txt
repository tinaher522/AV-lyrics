<song artist="The_Doors" title="Power_Turned_Off">
Alright, alright, alright! Hey! Hey! Hey, hey! Hey, hey! Hey! Come on! I tell ya, man, these cocksuckers... Now wait a minute, listen, if we don't quit early, they're gonna send off a letter to all the hall managers, all across America, saying The Doors are a bad... wait, now what time is it anyway?... I'm not leavin' 'til we get ourselves off, man, let's have some fun!... Yeah!... Hey! Hey, let's tell them we're not leavin' 'til we get some more power, man... The assholes are gonna win, man, if we don't do somethin' man... [crowd: WE WANT THE DOORS!] We don't have any electricity!...
