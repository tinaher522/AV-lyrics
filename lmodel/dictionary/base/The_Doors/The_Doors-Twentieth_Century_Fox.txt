<song artist="The_Doors" title="Twentieth_Century_Fox">
Well, she's fashionably lean
And she's fashionably late
She'll never rank a scene
She'll never break a date
But she's no drag, just watch the way she walks
She's a twentieth century fox
She's a twentieth century fox
No tears, no fears
No ruined years
No clocks
She's a twentieth century fox
She's the queen of cool
And she's the lady who waits
Since her mind left school
It never hesitates
She won't waste time on elementary talk
'Cause she's a twentieth century fox
She's a twentieth century fox
Got the world locked up
Inside a plastic box
She's a twentieth century fox, oh yeah
Twentieth century fox, oh yeah
Twentieth century fox
She's a twentieth century fox
