<song artist="The_Doors" title="Peace_Frog">
There's blood in the streets, it's up to my ankles
Blood in the streets, it's up to my knee
Blood in the streets of the town of Chicago
Blood on the rise, it's following me
She came...
Just about the break of day
She came, then she drove away
Sunlight in her hair
Blood on the streets runs a river of sadness
Blood in the streets, it's up to my thigh
The river runs red down the legs of the city
The women are crying and rivers are weeping
She came in town and then she drove away
Sunlight in her hair
Indians scattered on dawn's highway, bleeding
Ghosts crowd the young child's fragile, eggshell mind
Blood in the streets in the town of New Haven
Blood stains the roofs and the palm trees of Venice
Blood in my love in the terrible summer
Bloody red sun of fantastic L.A.
Blood screams her brain as they chop off her fingers
Blood willll be born in the birth of a nation
Blood is the rose of mysterious union
There's blood in the streets, it's up to my ankles
Blood in the streets, it's up to my knee
Blood in the streets of the town of Chicago
Blood on the rise, it's following me
