<song artist="The_Doors" title="We_Could_Be_So_Good_Together">
We could be so good together
Yeah, so good together
We could be so good together
Yeah, we could
I know we could
Tell you lies
I'll tell you wicked lies
Tell you lies
Tell you wicked lies
I'll tell you 'bout the world that we'll invent
Wanton world without lament
Enterprise, expedition
Invitation and invention
Yeah
So good together
Ah, so good together
We could be so good together
Yeah, we could
I know we could
We could be so good together
Yeah, so good together
We could be so good together
Yeah, we could
I know we could
Tell you lies
Tell you wicked lies
Tell you lies
Tell you wicked lies
The time you wait subtracts from joy
Beheads the angels you destroy
Angels fight
Angels cry
Angels dance and angels die
We could be so good together
Yeah, so good together
We could be so good together
Yeah, we could
I know we could
