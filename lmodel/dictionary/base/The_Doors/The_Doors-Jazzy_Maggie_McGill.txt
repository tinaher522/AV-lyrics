Miss Maggie M'Gill
She lived on a hill
Her daddy got drunk
And left her no will
So she went down
Down to Tangie Town
People down there
Really like to get it on
Now if you're sad
And you're feeling blue
Go out and buy a brand new
Pair of shoes
And you go down
Down to Tangie Town
'Cause people down there
Really like to get it on, get it on, yeah
Illegitimate son of a rock and roll star
Illegitimate son of a rock and roll star
Mom met dad
In the back of a rock and roll car, yeah
Well, I'm an old blues man
And I think that you understand
I've been singing the blues
Ever since the world began, yeah
Maggie, Maggie, Maggie M'Gill
Roll on, roll on, Maggie M'Gill
