<song artist="The_Doors" title="Hour_For_Magic">
Resident mockery give us an hour for magic 
We of the purple glove 
We of the starling flight and velvet hour 
We of Arabic pleasure's breed 
We of sun dome and the night 
Give us a creed to believe a night of lust 
Give us trust in the night 
Give of color hundred hues 
a rich mandala for me and for you 
And for your silky pillowed house 
a head, wisdom and a bed 
Troubled decree resident mockery has claimed thee 
We used to believe in the good old days 
We still receive in little ways 
The things of kindness and unsporting brow 
Forget and allow
