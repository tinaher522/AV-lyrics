<song artist="The_Doors" title="Crossroads_Blues">
Woke up this morning
Got the crossroads on my mind.
Well I woke up this morning
Got the crossroads on my mind.
Take a walk with me
And everything will work out fine.
Well I woke up this morning
Got the judgement on my mind.
Well I woke up this morning
Got the judgement on my mind.
Take a walk with me
And everything will work out fine.
Well I woke up this morning
Got the H-bomb on my mind.
Well I woke up this morning
Got the H-bomb on my mind.
Take a walk with me
And everything will work out fine.
Woke up this morning
Got the crossroads on my mind.
Well I woke up this morning
Got the crossroads on my mind.
Take a walk with me
And everything will work out fine.
Woke up this morning
Got nothing on my mind.
Well I woke up this morning
Nothing on my mind.
Take a walk with me
And everything will work out fine.
