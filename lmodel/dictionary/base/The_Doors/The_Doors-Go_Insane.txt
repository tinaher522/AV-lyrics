<song artist="The_Doors" title="Go_Insane">
once i had a little game
i liked to crawl back in my brain
i think you know the game i mean
i mean the game called go insane
Now, you should try 
this little game
just close your eyes
forget your name
forget the world, forget the people
and we'll erect a different steeple
this little game is fun to do
just close your eyes
no way to lose
and i'm right here
i'm going to
release control
we're breaking through
