<song artist="The_Doors" title="The_WASP_(Texas_Radio_And_The_Big_Beat)">
I wanna tell you about Texas Radio and the Big Beat
Comes out of the Virginia swamps
Cool and slow with money and precision
With a back beat narrow and hard to master
Some call it heavenly in its brilliance
Others, mean and rueful of the Western dream
I love the friends I have gathered together on this thin raft
We have constructed pyramids in honor of our escaping
This is the land where the Pharaoh died
The Negroes in the forest brightly feathered
They are saying, "Forget the night -
Live with us in forests of azure
Out here in the perimeter there are no stars
Out here we is stoned, immaculate"
Now listen to this, I'll tell you about the heartache
I'll tell you about the heartache and the loss of God
I'll tell you about the hopeless night
The meager food for souls forgot
I'll tell you about the maiden with wrought-iron soul
I'll tell you this
No eternal reward will forgive us now for wasting the dawn
I'll tell you 'bout Texas Radio and the Big Beat
Soft driven, slow and mad, like some new language
Now, listen to this, I'll tell you about Texas
I'll tell you 'bout Texas Radio
I'll tell you 'bout the hopeless night
Wand'rin' in the Western dream
Tell you 'bout the maiden with wrought-iron soul
