<song artist="The_Doors" title="You_Make_Me_Real_(Live)">
I really want you, Really do
Really need you, baby, God knows I do
'Cause I'm not real enough without you
Oh, what can I do.
You make me real, You make me feel
Like lovers feel.
You make me throw away mistaken misery
Make me feel love
Make me free.
I really want you
Really do
Really need you, baby
Really do
'Cause I'm not real enough without you
What can I do.
You make me real
Only you, baby
Have that appeal.
So let me slide into your tender sunken sea
Make me feel love
Make me free.
You make me real, all right
You make me feel
Like lovers feel.
You make me throw away mistaken misery
You make me feel love
You make me free.
Make me free
You make me real.
