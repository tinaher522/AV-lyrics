<song artist="The_Doors" title="Texas_Radio_And_The_Big_Beat_(Live)">
I wanna tell you about Texas Radio and the Big Beat
Comes out of the Virginia swamps
Cool and slow with a back beat
Narrow and hard to master
Some call it heavenly in it's brilliance
Others, mean and ruthful of the Western dream
I love the friends I have gathered together on this thin raft
We've constructed pyramids in honor of our escaping
This is the land where the Pharaoh died
Children,
The river contains specimens
The voices of singing women
Call us on the far shore
And they are saying,
"Forget the Night
live with us in Forests of azure"
Meager food for souls forgot
I tell you this;
No eternal reward will
Forgive us now for
Wasting the dawn
And one morning you awoke
And the strange sun
And opening your door...
