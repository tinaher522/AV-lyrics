Yeah...
Now I like the way
You're looking baby.
Now I've been out there
And you can tell me babe.
I like to get myself together.
Yeah, I like it real slow
I like it real bad
I like to get myself together
I like to feel all right
I love to hear you cryin'
I like to hear you get yourself
Into a mighty fine mess.
I like to hear yourself,
You get undressed.
Naked woman,
Out of doors,
I don't care
How loud you snore.
All I wanna see
Is your little ass
Just wigglin' around, yeah.
