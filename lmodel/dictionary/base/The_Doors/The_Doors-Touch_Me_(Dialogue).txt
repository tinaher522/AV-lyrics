<song artist="The_Doors" title="Touch_Me_(Dialogue)">
Is everybody ready
I moved the snaredrum, Mike
I banged into it
I'm sorry John
What do you it
I banged into the snaredrum, Mike
Is this the right place
Say it again, say it loud
I banged into the snaredrum, Mike
Is it in the right place now
Ok
Is that gonna be in yourÂ ???
All right, leave it
It's a good place
