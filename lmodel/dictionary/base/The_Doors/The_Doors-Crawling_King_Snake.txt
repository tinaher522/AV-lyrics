<song artist="The_Doors" title="Crawling_King_Snake">
Well, I'm the crawlin' king snake
And I rule my den
I'm the crawlin' king snake
And I rule my den
Yeah, don't mess 'round with my mate
Gonna use her for myself
Caught me crawlin', baby, window
Grass is very high
Keep on crawlin' 'til the day I die
Crawlin' king snake
And I rule my den
You better give me what I want
Gonna crawl no more
Caught me crawlin', baby, crawlin'
'Round your door
Seein' everything I want, I'm gonna crawl on your floor
Let's crawl
And I rule my den
Come on, give me what I want
Ain't gonna crawl no more
Alright, crawl a while
Come on, crawl
Come on, crawl
Get out there on your hands and knees, baby
Crawl all over me
Just like the spider on the wall
Ooh, we gon' crawl
One more
Well, I'm the crawlin' king snake
And I rule my den
Call me the crawlin' king snake
And I rule my den
Yeah, don't mess 'round with my mate
Gonna use her for myself
