Yeah, right
Did you hear about my baby? She come around
She come round here, the head to the ground?
Come round here just about midnight
She makes me feel so good, make me feel all right
She come round my street, now
She come to my house and
Knock upon my door
Climbing up my stairs, one, two
(Unwriteable improvisation)
Come on baby
Here she is in my room, oh boy
Hey what's your name?
How old are you?
Where'd you go to school?
Aha, yeah
Aha, yeah
Ah, ah yeah, ah yeah
Oh haa, mmm
Well, now that we know each other a little bit better
Why don't you come over here?
Make me feel all right!
Gloria, Gloria
Gloria, Gloria
Gloria, Gloria
All night, all day
All right, okey, yey!
(Gloria, Gloria)
You were my queen and I was your fool
Riding home after school
You took me home
To your house
Your father's at work
Your mama's out shopping around
Check me into your room
Show me your thing
Why'd you do it baby?
Getting softer, slow it down
Softer, get it down
Now you show me your thing
Wrap your legs around my neck
Wrap your arms around my feet, yeah
Wrap your hair around my skin
I'm gonna huh, right, ok, yeah
It's getting harder
It's getting too darn fast
It's getting harder
All right!
Come on, now, let's get it on
Too late, too late, too late
Too late, too late, too late
Can't stop, wow!
Make me feel all right!
Gloria, Gloria
Gloria, Gloria
All night, all day
All right, okey, yey!
Gloria, Gloria
Keep the whole thing going, baby!
All right!
All right!
Aaaaah
