<song artist="The_Doors" title="Love_Me_Tender">
All your dreams fullfilled.
I am yours and you are mine,
And we always will.
Love me tender,
Love me true,
All my dreams fullfilled.
You are mine,
And I am yours,
And I always will.
Love me tender,
Love me true,
All my dreams fullfilled.
You are mine,
And I am yours,
And I always will.
