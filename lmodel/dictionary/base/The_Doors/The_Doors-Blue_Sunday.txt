<song artist="The_Doors" title="Blue_Sunday">
I found my own true love
Was on a blue Sunday
She looked at me and told me
I was the only
One in the world
Now I have found my girl
My girl awaits for me in tender time
My girl is mine
She is the world
She is my girl
My girl awaits for me in tender time
My girl is mine
She is the world
She is my girl
