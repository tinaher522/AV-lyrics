<song artist="The_Doors" title="The_Soft_Parade">
When I was back there in seminary school
There was a person there who put forth the proposition
That you can petition the Lord with prayer
Petition the Lord with prayer
Petition the Lord with prayer
You cannot petition the Lord with prayer!
Can you give me sanctuary?
I must find a place to hide
A place for me to hide
Can you find me soft asylum?
I can't make it any more
The man is at the door
Peppermint miniskirts, chocolate candy
Champion sax and a girl named Sandy
There's only four ways to get it unraveled
One is to sleep and the other is travel but now
One is a bandit up in the hills
One is to love your neighbor 'til
His wife gets home
Catacombs
Nursery bones
Winter women growing stones
Carrying babies to the river
Streets and shoes
Avenues
Leather riders selling news
The monk bought lunch
(Yeah, he bought a little. Yes, he did! Yow!)
(This is the best part of the trip
This is the trip
The best part
I really like
What?)
(Yeah!
Yeah, yow...
Pretty good, huh?
Ha!)
(Yeah, I'm proud to be a part of this number)
Successful hills are here to stay
Everything must be this way
Gentle street where people play
Welcome to the soft parade
All our lives we sweat and save
Building for a shallow grave
Must be something else, we say
Somehow to defend this place
Everything must be this way
Everything must be this way (Yeah!)
The soft parade has now begun
Listen to the engines hum
People out to have some fun
Cobra on my left
Leopard on my right (Yeah!)
Deer woman in a silk dress
Girls with beads around their necks
Kiss the hunter of the green vest
Who has wrestled before
With lions in the night
Out of sight
The lights are getting brighter
The radio is moaning
Calling to the dogs
There are still a few animals
Left out in the yard
But it's getting harder
To describe sailors
To the underfed
Tropic corridor
Tropic treasure
What got us this far
To this mild equator
We need someone or something new
Something else to get us through, yeah (Come on)
Calling on the dogs
Calling on the dogs
But it's getting harder
Calling on the dogs
Calling on the dogs
Calling in the dogs
Calling all the dogs
Calling on the gods
You gotta meet me, a few animals, at the crossroads
You gotta meet me, at the edge of town
Outskirts of the city
You and I
And the evening sky
You'd better come alone
You'd better bring your gun
We're gonna have some fun
Just you and I
When all else fails
We can whip the horses' eyes
And make them sleep
And cry
