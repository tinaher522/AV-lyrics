Now when I got home
I heard my daddy say
You wanna get a little peace, honey
And my skin turned cold.
I heard my momma
The old lady say she gettin too old 
You want a little peace?
Do you want a little peace?
Do you want a little soul?
Do you want a little soul?
Do you want a little soul? 
Do you want a little ho, huh, huh, hey.
Yeah... 
Don't do it.
Don't do it.
Don't do it.
Don't do it. 
She moves me, babe.
Don't do it.
She moves me, yeah.
Don't do it.
Don't do it.
Don't do it.
Don't do it. 
I could not help myself.
I could not help myself.
I could not help myself.
I could not help myself.
I could not help myself.
I could not help myself.
I could not help myself.
I could not help myself.
I could not help, help, help,
I'm dyin'.
I'm dyin'.
I'm dyin'.
I'm dyin'.
I'm dyin'.
I'm die, die, diga, diga, doo, dah.
Whoo. 
Aww...
Rock and roll
Rock and roll is dead. 
We had some good times,
We had some fun.
We had some good times,
We had some fun.
It's over.
It's over.
It's over, oh.
Have mercy.
Have mercy.
Have mercy on your poor son. 
Rock and roll.
We had some good times.
We used to rock around out
It's all over.
I feel so sad. 
The girls used to take their clothes off
And expose themselves. 
And the music played on.
And we had some good times.
But they're gone.
They're gone.
They're gone.
They're gone.
They're gone. 
Now listen I'm not talking
About no revolution.
I swear to you I'm not talking
About no constitution.
I'm not talking
About no upside downs
Or inside out.
The only thing I'm gonna tell you about 
We, we had some good times
We had some good times
We had a few good times
But those good times
All those good little times
You know where they are?
You know where they ended up?
Well they're gone.
They're absolutely
Positively under the ground
And they're - 
Yeah I wanna talk
About a little good times.
Nothing special,
Just wanna sing along
Just as long as I got breath.
The death of rock
Is the death of me
And rock is
Dead!
Well, we're dead!
All right! 
Yeah...
We used to talk about rock and roll. 
We used to talk about the twist and the stroll.
We used to talk about everything but 
Rock is dead, baby.
Rock is dead.
Rock is dead. 
All right.
