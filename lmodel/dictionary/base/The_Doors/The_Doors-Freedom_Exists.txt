<song artist="The_Doors" title="Freedom_Exists">
Did you know freedom exists in school books
Did you know madmen are running our prisons
Within a jail, within a gaol
Within a white free protestant maelstrom
We're perched headlong on the edge of boredom
We're reaching for death on the end of a candle
We're trying for something that's already found us
