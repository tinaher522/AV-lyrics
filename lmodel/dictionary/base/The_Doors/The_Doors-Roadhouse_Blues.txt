<song artist="The_Doors" title="Roadhouse_Blues">
A-keep your eyes on the road, your hand upon the wheel
Keep your eyes on the road, your hand upon the wheel
Yeah, we're goin' to the roadhouse
We're gonna have a real
A-good time
Yeah, the back of the roadhouse they got some bungalows
Yeah, the back of the roadhouse they got some bungalows
And that's for the people
Who like to go down slow
Let it roll, baby, roll
Let it roll, baby, roll
Let it roll, baby, roll
Let it roll, all night long
Do it, Robby, do it
All right
Hey, yeah
You gotta roll, roll, roll
You gotta thrill my soul, all right
Roll, roll, roll, roll
A-thrill my soul
Da ga da beep a con ja choo chon
Honk honk honk
A don ta ee cha koo na nee cha
Bop a loo la ree chow
Bomp a kee cho ee sonk konk
Yeah, ride
Ashen lady, ashen lady
Give up your vows, give up your vows
Save our city, save our city
Right now
And I woke up this morning, I got a-myself a beer
And I woke up this morning, and I got a-myself a beer
The future's uncertain and the end is always near
Let it roll, baby, roll
Let it roll, baby, roll
Let it roll, baby, roll
Let it roll, hey
All night long
Yikes!
