<song artist="The_Doors" title="Mean_Mustard_Blues">
Well baby
You been away so long, woman
I said baby
You've been away so long
Well come on back, baby
Cause your man wants you home
I got a fine little baby
Weighs about five hundred pounds
I got a fine little baby
Weighs about five hundred pounds
Well my woman makes love, boys
You oughta come around
Well we're fighting in the war
People gonna ball
Sitsaw conka cheecha aw
All right now, baby
Well it's all right
I'm going home
Back where I belong
"Oh Detroit
You're looking good, tonight
I feel good in Detroit city
Make those Cadillacs
And make those other cars
You know what the blues is
You know
I know you people know out there
'Cause I can feel you
I can feel you boogeyin' all night"
