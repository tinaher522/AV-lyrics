Summertime
The livin' is easy
Fish are jumpin'
And the cotton is high
Your momma's rich, yeah
Your daddy's good lookin', yeah
Hush little baby
Whoa, don't you cry
Don't you cry, yeah
Don't you cry
Don't you cry
Don't you cry
Don't you cry, yeah
Please don't cry
Summertime, yeah
And the livin' is easy
Fish are jumpin'
Yeah, the cotton is high, high, high
Your momma's rich, oh yeah
And your daddy's good lookin', ohh
Hush little baby
Don't you cry
Alright, now let's get real quiet, now
Let's get real quiet
Real quiet
Let's get real soft
Let's get real soft
Let's get real soft
Real soft
Let's get real soft
Real soft
Let's get real soft
Let's get real soft
Let's get soft
Let's get soft
Let's get soft
Let's get soft
Let's get real soft
And let's get real slow
Now come on, cool it, cool it
Get way down
Way down, mama
Way down
Way down
Way down
Way down
Way down
Go down
Go down
Go down
