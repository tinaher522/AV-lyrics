<song artist="Kylie_Minogue" title="Heartstrings">
I was stuck in a cycle
Staggering slowly on ahead
Paying the price and waiting for answers
But then, but then you took me in
You unravel me
Set my spirit free
And everything inside of me
Calls out your name now
You breathe new life in me
You lift me off my knees
And it's makin' me so high
I won't come down
Because you pull me in
Baby, you pull on my heartstrings
And it's the deepest feeling
You have such an effect on me
You give me everything
You pull me in
Baby, you pull on my heart strings
And it's the deepest feeling
You have such an effect on me
You give me everything
I was stuck in a cycle
Staggering slowly on ahead
Paying the price and waiting for answers
But then, but then you took me in
You unravel me
Set my spirit free
And everything inside of me
Calls out your name now
You breathe knees life in me
You lift me off my knees
And it's makin' me so high
I won't come down
Because you pull me in
Baby, you pull on my heartstrings
And it's the deepest feeling
You have such an effect on me
You give me everything
You pull me in
Baby, you pull on my heartstrings
And it's the deepest feeling
You have such an effect on me
You give me everything
You pull me in
Baby, you pull on my heartstrings
And it's the deepest feeling
You have such an effect on me
You give me everything
