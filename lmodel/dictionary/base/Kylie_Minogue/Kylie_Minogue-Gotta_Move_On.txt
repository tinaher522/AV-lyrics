<song artist="Kylie_Minogue" title="Gotta_Move_On">
Can't you see the state you're in?
What you're feeling isn't true
What you gotta do is
Turn away, leave the past behind
We can say we gave it our best try
Turn away, never live a lie
(A brighter day) A brighter day's in sight
Never seek, you'll never find
How can you have peace of mind
You belong with someone else
Is it time you asked yourself to
Turn away, leave the past behind
We can say we gave it our best try
Turn away, never live a lie
(A brighter day) A brighter day's in sight
It is time that you moved on
It has now been way too long
This is not where you belong
It is time that you move on, move on
It is time that you move on, move on 
Move on, move on, move on
It is time that you moved on
It has now been way too long
This is not where you belong
It is time that you move on, move on
Move on, move on, move on
