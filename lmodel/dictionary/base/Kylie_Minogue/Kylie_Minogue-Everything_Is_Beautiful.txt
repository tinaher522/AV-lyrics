<song artist="Kylie_Minogue" title="Everything_Is_Beautiful">
Beautiful, ah ah ah...
Beautiful, ah ah ah...
I'm losing my way in this night,
walking away from the light.
Surrender will be my escape.
Breaking the walls of my mind,
I'm one step ahead of the truth.
I hear what I want to hear and I hear you.
And if I lie with you long enough,
I can see the things I'm dreaming of.
Let's go through the ritual
until everything is beautiful.
Beautiful...
Beautiful...
I'm getting a taste for this high,
for bending the rules of what's right.
But fooling myself feels so sweet,
reality looks black and white.
Pulling the ripcord, I dive.
It's a cardboard kingdom, but it makes me feel that
if I lie with you long enough,
I can see the things I'm dreaming of.
Let's go through the ritual
until everything is beautiful.
Beautiful...
Beautiful...
And now I'm traveling at such blissful speed,
no need to think of this velocity.
The things I feel begin to fade to black,
now I've burned my map and I won't go back, 'cause
if I lie with you long enough,
I can see the things I'm dreaming of.
Let's go through the ritual
until everything is beautiful.
And if I lie with you long enough,
I can see the things I'm dreaming of.
So let's go through the ritual
until everything is beautiful.
Beautiful, ah ah ah ah...
Beautiful, ah ah ah ah...
Beautiful, ah ah ah...
