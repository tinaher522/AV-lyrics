<song artist="Kylie_Minogue" title="This_Girl">
Take me as I am 
Though I'm good at pretending 
I tire easily 
And hurry to the ending
There's more than what you see 
But not the way you see it 
I hope you follow me 
And you get the meaning 
Here is where I stand 
Here is who I am 
And I'm not interested in 
Fitting in 
I only want to be 
To be this girl 
I'm not interested in 
Giving in
I only want to be 
This girl 
Take me as you will 
Under no illusions 
I offer myself whole
I give into you and I 
Offer you the sky 
The sun and moon and seas
But you need to know that I 
Not more or less than me 
Here is where I stand 
Here is who I am 
And I'm not interested in 
Fitting in
I only want to be 
To be this girl
I'm not interested in
Giving in 
I only want to be 
This girl
I'm not interested in 
Fitting in 
I only want to be 
To be this girl
I'm not interested in 
Giving in 
I only want to be 
This girl
