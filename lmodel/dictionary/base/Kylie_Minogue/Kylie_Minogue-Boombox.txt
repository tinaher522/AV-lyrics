<song artist="Kylie_Minogue" title="Boombox">
Let it drop
Make it rock
Baby i'm your boombox
Make you spin like a top
Shout it out from the rooftop
I wanna get in let drop make it rock
Makes me wanna groove
Tune into the sound
Of my underground
Bright lights
Blue sky,sky,sky,sky,sky
Tune into the sound
Of my underground
Bright lights
Blue sky,sky,sky,sky,sky
Drop
Makes me wanna rock
I got a boombox so give me your cd
Tune into the sound
Of my underground
Bright lights
Blue sky,sky,sky,sky,sky
Tune into the sound
Of my underground
Bright lights
Blue sky,sky,sky,sky,sky
