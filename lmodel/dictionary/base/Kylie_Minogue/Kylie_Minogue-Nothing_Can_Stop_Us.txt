<song artist="Kylie_Minogue" title="Nothing_Can_Stop_Us">
I've gone a long lone way
Since the day you walked into my life
We've smooved out all the rough edges
Of our sweet love and devotion
The price is high given life as a scale
Wondering where I'd gone wrong
And I know it's going to work out fine
When I see that look in your eyes
I never felt so good
I never felt so strong
Nothing can stop us now
Yeah, nothing can stop us now
What can I say
That a man who thinks that a woman is weak
Is so long
Cause nobody can hide from you
We both know that something else is true
Just the touch of your hand
And I know you're going to make it
I never felt so good
I never felt so strong
Nothing can stop us now
I never felt so good
I never felt so strong
Nothing can stop us now
Nothing can stop us now
Nothing can stop us now
Nothing can stop us now
