<song artist="Kylie_Minogue" title="Love_At_First_Sight_1988">
Never thought I would fall for a stranger
Never thought I'd be so naive
Trying explaining the strangest behaviour
But this never happened to me
I just met the boy of my dreams
He smiled at me from afar
Before I could think about leaving
He was holding me in his arms
Now I believe in love at first sight
Now I believe it can be (I believe it)
Yes I believe in love at first sight
'Cause I'm sure it just happened to me
He smiled at me, asked me to dance
He told me he'd seen me before
I could not resist his advances
I know I should see him some more
I wanted to tell him I loved him
I wanted to say it right then
My heart was so full of emotion
And I just had to see him again
Now I believe in love at first sight
Now I believe it can be (I believe it)
Yes I believe in love at first sight
'Cause I'm sure it just happened to me
Believe in love at first sight, believe in love at first sight
Believe in love at first sight, believe in love at first sight
I just met the boy of my dreams
He smiled at me from afar
Before I could think about leaving
He was holding me in his arms
Now I believe in love at first sight
Now I believe it can be (I believe it)
Yes I believe in love at first sight
'Cause I'm sure it just happened to me
