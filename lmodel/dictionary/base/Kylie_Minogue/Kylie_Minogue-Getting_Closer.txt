<song artist="Kylie_Minogue" title="Getting_Closer">
You caught my eye
I'm looking at you baby
The way you let your body move me
You look so fine
Come a little closer
I know that we can do it
I feel that we can make it
I feel you getting closer
Minute by minute by minute
Ohh-ohh
Day by day and night by night
I feel you getting closer
Bit by bit and move by move
I feel you getting closer
Minute by minute (by minute)
If you were mine
I'd never want another
'Cause you're doing something to me
If it takes all night
For us to be together
You're love is worth the waiting
I feel it growing stronger
I feel know it's getting closer
Minute by minute
Ohh-ohh
Day by day and night by night
I feel you getting closer
Bit by bit and move by move
I feel you getting closer
Minute by minute (by minute)
Day by day and night by night
I feel you getting closer
Bit by bit and move by move
I feel you getting closer
Minute by minute (by minute)
Day by day and night by night
I feel you getting closer
Bit by bit and move by move
I feel you getting closer
Minute by minute (by minute)
