<song artist="Kylie_Minogue" title="Magnetic_Electric">
Oh, oh, oh, oh, don't ask me to dance
I'm scared this feeling's out of my hands
That look just took my breath away
It's plugged me into you
And I'm tuning in, tuning in
Slowly like a radio (radio, radio)
You pull me in pull, me in
Baby, and I can't let go
Can't stop, now we're
Too hot bodies with chemistry that's on the rise
It's electric, magnetic electric
The heat screams out and echoes around all tonight
Two hot bodies bound together with no choice
It's electric magnetic electric
Star crossed lovers drown in the sound of this white noise 
Oh yes, oh yes, I'm hearing it loud
I must confess I like it
It's everything I wanted and more
You give me bait, I bite it
And I'm tuning in ,tuning in
Slowly like a radio (radio, radio)
Its coming in, coming in
The signal is out of control
Can't stop, now we're
Too hot bodies with chemistry that's on the rise
It's electric, magnetic electric
The heat screams out and echoes all around tonight
Too hot bodies bound together with no choice
It's electric, magnetic electric
Star crossed lovers drown in the sound of this white noise
(It's electric, magnetic electric)
(White noise)
Oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh oh 
Oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh
Too hot bodies with chemistry that's on the rise
It's electric, magnetic electric
The heat screams out and echoes all around tonight
Too hot bodies bound together with no choice
It's electric magnetic electric
Star crossed lovers drown in the sound of this white noise
