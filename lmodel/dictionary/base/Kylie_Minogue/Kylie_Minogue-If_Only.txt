<song artist="Kylie_Minogue" title="If_Only">
If innocence was something that could be kept
I turned around and the whole world spun for me
If I didn't tire of the places I wanna forget
So I don't look down
If every easy way in had an easy way out
If every step up had no step down
When I feel it, you can feel it
So it don't take two hearts
One not left to be lonely
If only
True love was waiting in the wings
If only
Two hearts
One not left to be lonely
If only
True love was waiting in the wings
Only if only
Only if only
If some things have never been said
If little lines in the sand could comfort me
And erase memories I need to forget
So I don't look down
If innocence was something that could be kept
I turned around and the whole world spun for me
When I feel it
You can feel it
You can feel it
If I set you free and you actually came back to me
Take two hearts
One not left to be lonely
If only
True love was waiting in the wings
If only
Two hearts
One not left to be lonely
If only
True love was waiting in the wings
Only if only
If I set you free
And you actually came back to me
Take two hearts
One not left to be lonely
If only
True love was waiting in the wings
If only
Two hearts
One not left to be lonely
If only
True love was waiting in the wings
Only if only
Only if only
Only if only
