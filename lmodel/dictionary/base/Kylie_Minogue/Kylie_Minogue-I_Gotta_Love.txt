<song artist="Kylie_Minogue" title="I_Gotta_Love">
It only lasts
until it goes
it only gives
until it leaves
oh my god
its only is love
CHOURUS:
Oh, i gotta love
i gotta love
i gotta love you
we need some help
with are love
but it dosn't all last
until you lose it
CHOURUS
if you won't love
i will love you
please baby
lets live and love together
CHOURUS
CHOURUS
CHOURUS
(repeat again again whille fading till no sound heard)
