<song artist="Kylie_Minogue" title="Crystallize">
When everything is caving in
And you don't know what you're gonna do
When everyone is up and gone
And you don't know what will get you through 
When you don't know if you should go or stay
You only have to turn my way
Baby you can always count on me
Just come and look deep into my eyes, crystallize 
So don't go runnin' from my lovin' everything's gonna be alright 
When you and I crystallize 
Crystallize, crystallize
Oh-oh whoa
And now that we are suddenly 
Able to take ourselves away 
Want you to know I won't let go
Baby I got you all the way
When you don't know if you should go or stay
You only have to turn my way 
Baby you can always count on me
Just come and look deep into my eyes, crystallize 
So don't go runnin' from my lovin' everything's gonna be alright 
When you and I crystallize
In the darkness 
When it's all a mess 
And when you're swimming through a sea of broken promises 
You can find me
Shining like a laser beam
Feel the light 
Baby you can always count on me
Just come and look deep into my eyes, crystallize 
So don't go runnin' from my lovin' everything's gonna be alright 
When you and I crystallize
