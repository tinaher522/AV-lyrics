I'm your boombox

Boombox box box

Boombox
Boombox
Boombox
Boombox box box
I'm your boombox
Box (x15)
Tu-tune into the sound
Of my underground
Blasting out loud
Of my (?)
Give me some fun
Take myself and stereo down
I'm on highway number 1
Go-going (?)
I'm diging you
I got a boombox,boombox,boombox
You got batteries,batteries,bat-bat-bat
I got a boombox,boombox,boombox
So give me your cd
Are you enjoying the ride
Bright lights
Blue sky
Moonboots open wide
(?)
Wouldn't mind when I say mmm hmm
Makes me wanna move
I-I-I-I got a boombox,boombox,boombox
You got batteries,batteries,bat-bat-bat
I got a boombox,boombox,boombox
So give me your cd
Let it drop make it rock
Baby I'm your boombox
Make you spin like a top
Turn me on and push play
Shout it out from the roof top
I wanna here it
Let it drop
Make it rock
Baby i'm your boombox
Let it drop make it rock
Baby I'm your boombox
Make you spin like a top
Turn me on and push play
Shout it out from the roof top
I wanna here it
Let it drop
Make it rock
Baby I'm your boombox
Boombox
Boombox
Boombox
Boombox
Listen to my future sound
Of Los Angeles
Are your speakers loud enough
To handle it
If you're (?)
Then your on the guest list
For sonic bliss
Sonic bliss
Sonic bliss
Sonic bliss
Sonic bliss
Sonic bliss
Sonic bliss
Boombox
Boom-boom
Let it drop make it rock
Baby I'm your boombox
Make you spin like a top
Turn me on and push play
Shout it out from the roof top
I wanna here it
Let it drop
Make it rock
Baby I'm your boombox
Let it drop make it rock
Baby I'm your boombox
Make you spin like a top
Turn me on and push play
Shout it out from the roof top
I wanna here it
Let it drop
Make it rock
Baby I'm your boombox
Boombox...
