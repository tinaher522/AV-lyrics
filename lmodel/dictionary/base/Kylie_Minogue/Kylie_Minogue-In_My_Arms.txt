<song artist="Kylie_Minogue" title="In_My_Arms">
How do you describe a feeling? 
I've only ever dreamt of this
DJ's spinning up my favourite song
Hurry up and get a move on
Light fantastic and it won't be long
Don't let the moment slip away
'Cause you and I could find a pleasure
No one else has ever known
Feels like it is now or never
Don't wanna be alone
How does it feel in my arms?
How does it feel in my arms?
Do you want it?
Do you need it?
Can you feel it?
Tell me, how does it feel in my arms?
Got a feeling this is something strong
All I wanna do is move on
No more wondering where I belong,
So never go away
'Cause you and I could find a pleasure
No one else has ever known
Feels like it is now or never
Don't wanna be alone
How does it feel in my arms? 
(How does it feel in my arms?)
How does it feel in my arms?
Do you want it? 
Do you need it? 
Can you feel it? 
Tell me, how does it feel in my arms?
Do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do
Oh yeah yeah 
Do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do
Oh yeah yeah 
I'm listening.
How does it feel in my arms? 
(How does it feel in my arms?)
How does it feel in my arms?
(Yeah, yeah)
Do you want it? 
Do you need it? 
Can you feel it? 
Tell me, how does it feel in my arms?
