<song artist="Kylie_Minogue" title="Boy">
Pretty little thing
Making my heart sing
When you do-hoo
What you do-hoo 
I just wanna know the score
So get up on the floor
Let me see-hee
Your best for me-hee
We can make it up
Don't wanna stop
You can't get enough
Get you feel the love
Feel your heartbeat
And your body heat
You can't get enough
Get up, boy
'Cos I wanna try to make you move
Get up, boy
'Cos I wanna get to know your groove
(Yeah yeah yeah)
Wanna make you mine
You are so divine
Can't you see-hee
You and me-hee
'Cos baby getting close to you
Is so easy to do
And tonight is the night
We're gonna make it alright
We can make it up
Don't wanna stop
You can't get enough
Get you feel the love
Feel your heartbeat
And your body heat
You can't get enough
Get up, boy
'Cos I wanna try to make you move
Get up, boy
'Cos I wanna get to know your groove
(Yeah yeah yeah)
Pretty little thing
Making my heart sing
Yeah
Wanna make you mine
You are so divine
So, Get up, boy
'Cos I wanna chance to make you move
Get up, boy
'Cos I wanna get to know your groove
Yeah yeah yeah
Get up, boy (get up boy)
'Cos I wanna chance to make you move (make you move)
Get up, boy (get up, boy)
'Cos I wanna get to know your groove (yeah yeah yeah)
Get up, boy
'Cos I wanna chance to make you move
Get up, boy
'Cos I wanna get to know your groove
Yeah yeah yeah
