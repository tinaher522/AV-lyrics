<song artist="Kylie_Minogue" title="Trippin_Me_Up">
It seems that you don't understand not to bite from the hand
That feeds you.
Don't know when you've got a good
Thing, I was out on a limb to be true.
Up until now, I
Tried to figure you out,
But I can't think when
You're pulling on my heart strings,
And now
It's....
CHORUS:
No good, you're
Trippin' me up
Like I knew you would,
I thought it
Was love.
Why wasn't I runnin' when I saw it
Comin'?
(No good) No, no!!
No good,
You're trippin' me up
Like I knew you would,
I
Thought it was love.
Why wasn't I runnin' when I
Saw it comin'?
No good!
Mmmm
No good
When you're rockin' the boat,
It's a slippery
Slope to nowhere.
Wonder why you're tryin' to hide
What you're keepin' aside and won't
Share.
Up until now, I tried to figure you out,
But
I can't think when you're pulling on my heart
Strings,
And now it's....
CHORUS:
No
Good, you're trippin' me up
Like I knew you
Would,
I thought it was love.
Why wasn't I
Runnin' when I saw it comin'?
No good!! No
Good!!
No good, you're trippin' me
Up
Like I knew you would,
I thought it was love.
Why
Wasn't I runnin' when I saw it comin'?
Mmmm,
No good!
No good!!
Oh now
It's....
No good!!
No Good!!
No
Good!!
CHORUS:
No good, you're trippin'
Me up
Like I knew you would,
I thought it was
Love.
Why wasn't I runnin' when I saw it
Comin'?
No good!!
No good, you're
Trippin' me up
Like I knew you would,
I thought it
Was love.
Why wasn't I runnin' when I saw it
Comin'?
No good!! No good!!
No good,
You're trippin' me up
