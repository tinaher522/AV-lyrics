<song artist="Kylie_Minogue" title="Sexy_Love">
There you go
You're like fireworks
And it's the fourth of July
I can't turn away
Look what you done to me
One more dance and I'm taking over
I need your touch
One more glance when you're licking your lips
I'm gonna have to rush
This night
We should get outta here
And after party for two
Then say you live near
That talk is dangerous
I want you like I know you want me
Am I saying too much?
Right now say what you want to
You can't make me blush
Step through that door
Like you know you’re fine
Step on that floor
Like you know you’re fine
You’re on fire
But you play it cool
Every eye on you
So don't blame me
For wanting you just too much
You're sexy
And what you need's a sexy love
All I see
Every time I look at you
Is you are free
I just wanna be with you
Gimme that sexy love
You look so sexy, so sexy in my head
You look so sexy, so sexy in my bed
You look so sexy, so sexy in my head
You look so sexy, so sexy in my bed
Get your coat we got places to go
There's so much I wanna see
Let's make out on the low
And just focus on us
I want you to feel like you're having the time of your life
And I can't keep a star like you waiting
Accept my invite
Step through that door
Like you know you’re fine
Step on that floor
Like you know you’re fine
You’re on fire
But you play it cool
Every eye on you
So don't blame me
For wanting you just too much
You're sexy
And what you need's a sexy love
All I see
Every time I look at you
Is you are free
I just wanna be with you
Gimme that sexy love
Ohhh
Don't blame me I can't get enough
I just want your sexy love
Ohhh
Your body's all I'm thinking of
I just want your sexy love
So don't blame me
For wanting you just too much
You're sexy
And what you need's a sexy love
All I see
Every time I look at you
Is you are free
I just wanna be with you
Just gimme that sexy love
You look so sexy, so sexy in my head
You look so sexy, so sexy in my bed
You look so sexy, so sexy in my head
You look so sexy, so sexy in my bed
Gimme that sexy love, whoa oh oh oh
Gimme that sexy love, whoa oh oh oh
Gimme that sexy love
