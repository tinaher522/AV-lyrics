<song artist="Kylie_Minogue" title="Stars">
You're asking yourself, what's real?
What to do with these feelings
That you have inside, surreal
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
When you look deep into the pockets of the universe...
You never know what you'll find
Because stars don't shine in singular places
Open up your mind's eye and
Light up familiar faces
Because in time
you'll find life and all of it's races
So open up your mind's eye
And go tonight
Begin to feel the light
How do we know the truth?
Gotta look to the root
Inside the meaning of life for you
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
When you look deep into the pockets of the universe...
You never know what you'll find
Because stars don't shine in singular places
Open up your mind's eye and
Light up familiar faces
Because in time
you'll find life and all of it's races
So open up your mind's eye
And go tonight
Begin to feel the light
Stars don't shine
Stars don't shine
Stars don't shine
Stars don't shine
Stars don't shine
You never know what you'll find
Because stars don't shine in singular places
Open up your mind's eye and
Light up familiar faces
Because in time
you'll find life and all of it's races
So open up your mind's eye
And go tonight
Begin to feel the light
