<song artist="Kylie_Minogue" title="We_Know_The_Meaning_Of_Love">
We may be young
Are you too old to listen
We could be wrong
But that's our decision 
We may not have
Experience or vision
But we can learn
From your mistakes
We may not know 
The question or solution
When I'm calling
For a revolution
We'll learn to fight
All the bitterness and hatred
Ask yourself
Why were we created
We may not have the future clear
We may not know the answer here
But we know the meaning of love
And we know there's never enough
We break the rules
Some rules were meant for breaking
They say we're crazy
'Bout the risk we're taking
We may not see
The consequence of what we're doin'
But that's okay
We just keep on movin'
We could be wrong but that's all right
We may not know the question why
But we know the meaning of love
And we know there's never enough
But we know the meaning of love
And we know there's never enough
Never, never, never (sampling)
Enough
We may not have the future clear
We may not know the answer here
But we know the meaning of love
And we know there's never enough
But we know the meaning of love
And we know there's never enough
But we know the meaning of love
And we know there's never enough
