<song artist="Kylie_Minogue" title="Glad_To_Be_Alive">
Ohh life's so hard 
Someday's you need something new to wear 
Like a brand new hat 
Try so hard 
To work it out 
People try to hold you back 
On day's like that 
You need another hand 
It's the same all over the world 
People have to earn a living 
Now you're so far from the troubles at home 
Leave them alone 
And they'll work themselves out 
We love it 
Glad to be alive 
I like it 
Working over time in lovin' 
I hope tomorrow feels like this 
Yeah 
Dreaming hard 
Brand new car 
And another home loan 
And the phone bill is overdue 
Don't give up on rainy days 
I've seen the sun come shining through 
On you and me 
Make you feel alright 
It's the same all over the world 
People have to earn a living 
Now you're so far from the troubles at home 
Leave them alone 
And they'll work themselves out 
We love it 
Glad to be alive 
I like it 
Life's so hard 
We can work it out 
Will it's a big tough city 
We can work out our way 
We love it 
Glad to be alive 
I like it
