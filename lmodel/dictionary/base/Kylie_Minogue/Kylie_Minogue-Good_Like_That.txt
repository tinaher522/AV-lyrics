<song artist="Kylie_Minogue" title="Good_Like_That">
I've never been the type who's gonna wait around
Not make a sound while others bring me down
I'm not someone who'll tell you what you wanna hear
Oh you've got to feel by keeping it real
And until now I've been patient
I've been good somehow
But anticipation's leaving me no doubt
About how it will be
When you let go of your fear and release
Let's move it to the fast lane
Take a chance and love me
I'll give you all I have
I'm good like that
Baby, when you crash into me
You'll finally understand
How loving me can change all your plans
I'm good like that
I'm good like that
Don't make me have to tell you that I told you so
'Cause I know you know and it's hard to hold
I cannot do this feeling, you'll find there's double meaning
To the things I say when you walk this way
Just relax, let me take control of you, sit back
Make you see where all this goes
I'm in too bad - what u got to lose
Compared to what I'm offering you?
Let's move it to the fast lane
Take a chance and love me
I'll give you all I have
I'm good like that
Baby, when you crash into me
You'll finally understand
How loving me can change all your plans
I'm good like that
I'm good like that
So take a chance and love me fast
I'll give you all-all that I have
I'm good, I'm good, I'm good like that
So take a chance and love me fast
I'll give you all-all that I have
I'm good, I'm good, I'm good like that
So take a chance and love me fast
I'll give you all-all that I have
I'm good, I'm good, I'm good like that
Let's move it to the fast lane
Take a chance and love me
I'll give you all I have
I'm good like that
Baby, when you crash into me
You'll finally understand
How loving me can change all your plans
Let's move it to the fast lane
Take a chance and love me
I'll give you all I have
I'm good like that
Baby, when you crash into me
You'll finally understand
How loving me can change all your plans
I'm good like that
