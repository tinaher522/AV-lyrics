<song artist="Kylie_Minogue" title="Sparks">
Oh, feels like you light me up 
Feels like you light me up 
When the sparks run out
Sometimes the love that you wasted 
Becomes the love that you've lost 
A moment feels like a life time 
Cry cry cry, you can't stop 
Just when I feel no ignition
No one but me understands 
Arms reach out from a distance 
Palm to palm, touching hands  
Oh, feels like you light me up 
Feels like you light me up 
When the sparks run out
Oh, feels like you light me up 
Feels like you light me up 
When the sparks run out
  You know that you are a fighter 
But you feel yourself fall apart 
Now you're just panicking because you're left defeated and you see nothing but dark 
But when my soul is in pieces 
No one but me understands 
Arms reach out from a distance 
Palm to palm, touching hands  
Oh, feels like you light me up 
Feels like you light me up 
When the sparks run out
Oh, feels like you light me up 
Feels like you light me up 
When the sparks run out
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la
 
Oh, feels like you light me up 
Feels like you light me up 
When the sparks run out
Oh, feels like you light me up 
Feels like you light me up 
When the sparks run out
