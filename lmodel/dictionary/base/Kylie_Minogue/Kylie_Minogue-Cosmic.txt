<song artist="Kylie_Minogue" title="Cosmic">
I wanted to write a song called cosmic
I wanted to get a view of the Earth
I wanted to be your lonesome cowboy
I wanted to love you till it hurt
I wanted the right to misbehave
To satiate my crave
I put these things aside for years
Till laughter took the place of tears
It's like I was asleep
Yet now I'm here
I'm here
I wanted to take your place just sometimes
To know the things you know
And why you did the things you do
To say no one time and believe it
Oh I wanted so much
But only needed you
Wasn't it just my choice to make
The bed in which I lay
I put these things aside for years
Till laughter took the place of tears
It's like I was asleep
Yet now I'm here
I'm here
I wanted to be able
To talk without the interruption
I wanted to sing exotic words
I wanted to find a way
To put an end to all of my destruction
Wanted to know what I was worth
Wasn't it just my choice to make
The bed in which I lay
I put these things aside for years
Till laughter took the place of tears
It's like I was asleep
Yet now I'm here
I'm here
I'm here
