I like it
Nu nu di di ty
Ever let me see
Nu-di-ty (whoo)
Hang your coat up
Hang your coat up
Lock the doors up
Lock the doors up
Let the steam rise in the skylight (alright)
Alright, are you ready to let it go tonight? (tonight)
Do your own thing with your own thing
Whoo, shake a hip
It's getting cool swing
Ooh ooh, guess who is watching now?
Look, look, looking wow
Flash it in fashion with me
Skin to skin, body to body
Dare to ever let me see
Nu-di-ty
Nu nu di di ty
Nu-di-ty
Time to strip down
Time to strip down
Just pop that zipper for me
And work that thing out
Just expose it
Cuz you know it's, alright (alright)
Are you ready to let it go tonight? (tonight)
Let it go, here we go
Just let it slip inside
That's right, here we go
One button at a time
Who cares who sees tonight?
Look, look, looking wow
Flashing in fashion with me
Skin to skin, body to body
Dare to ever let me see
Nu-di-ty
