<song artist="Kylie_Minogue" title="Feels_So_Good">
I realize, realize I get a little bit wild sometimes
And I am numb, I am numb to what we have become sometimes
So slip away with me, stay with me
Everything's okay with me right
Don't have to run, have to run
We can walk in the sun one last time
And it feels
Yeah, it feels so good
When you’re here
We are near to love
People come, people go
But I'd like to get to know you now
What is wrong with me, wrong with me
Want you to belong to me now
So come away with me, stay with me
I will start behaving right
And I don't have anything to tie me down tonight
And it feels
Yeah, it feels so good
When you’re here
We are near to love
Not giving up, no
If it feels so good
When you’re here (so close)
We are near to love
And I can't slow down
And I need you now
And I can't slow down
And I need you now
And I need you now
Yeah
And it feels (and it feels)
Yeah, it feels so good
When you’re here
(When you’re here, when you're here)
We are near to love
Not giving up, no (not giving up, not giving up, not giving up)
'Cause it feels so good
When you’re (so close)
We are near to love
Not giving up, not giving up, not giving up
Not giving up, not giving up, not giving up
Not giving up
Don't have to run, have to run
We can walk in the sun one last time
