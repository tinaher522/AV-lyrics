<song artist="Kylie_Minogue" title="I_Feel_For_You">
Flowers grow, 
They're everywhere you go, 
I feel, I feel
Rainbow sky, 
Whenever you are by, 
I feel, I feel
I feel for you, 
I can go on and on and on and on, 
I feel, I feel, I feel, 
You know I feel for you
Stars appear, 
The moment you are near, 
I feel, I feel
I feel for you, 
I can go on and on and on and on,
I feel for you, 
I can go on and on and on and on,
I feel, I feel, I feel, 
You know I feel for you
Every second of the day, 
You know I just can't stay away, 
Baby when you're next to me, 
That's the way I like to feel
Colour shine, 
A sunbeam through my mind
I feel for you, 
I can go on and on and on and on
I feel, I feel, I feel, 
You know I feel for you
