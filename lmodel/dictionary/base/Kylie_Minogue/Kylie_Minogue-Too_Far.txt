<song artist="Kylie_Minogue" title="Too_Far">
Caught up in this house
Trapped my very own self in the snare of my mind
No more space than a slither
What I'd give for a deep breath inside
Where the chaos has me captive
Where there's no exist sign
Where I fuel the stupid fire with these feelings of mine
Lured into this den, it's bitter and I want the sweetness again
A taste that I agree with
Get me past these perils and to my eden
Where the silence is a comfort
Where there is no one else
Where I'll be up from under can uncurl my self
Too many, too much, too hard
Help me
This time I went too far
Too many, too much, too hard
Help me
This time I went too far
Can I smash all of this open
Can I pass the hurt with a little pain
I wanna see all of it crumble and start afresh all over agin
My eyes are wide open
But I can hardly see
Will laughter find a way around these silent tears
Too many, too much, too hard
Help me
This time I went too far
Too many, too much, too hard
Help me
This time I went too far
