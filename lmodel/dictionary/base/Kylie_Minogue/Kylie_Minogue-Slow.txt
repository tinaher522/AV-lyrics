<song artist="Kylie_Minogue" title="Slow">
Knew you'd be here tonight
So I put my best dress on, boy I was so right
Our eyes connected
Now nothin's how it used to be, no second guesses
Tracking on this feeling
Pull focus close up you and me, nobody's leaving
Got me affected
Spun me 180 degrees, so electric
Slow down and dance with me, yeah, slow
Skip a beat and move with my body, yeah, slow
Come on and dance with me, yeah, slow
Skip a beat and move with my body, yeah, slow
Don't wanna rush it
Let the rhythmn pull you in, this will touch it
You know what I'm saying
And I haven't said a thing, keep the record playing
Slow down and dance with me, yeah, slow
Skip a beat and move with my body, yeah, slow
Come on and dance with me, yeah, slow
Skip a beat and move with my body, yeah, slow
Ohh, read my body language, take it down, down
Slow down and dance with me, yeah, slow
Skip a beat and move with my body, yeah, slow
Come on and dance with me, yeah, slow
Skip a beat and move with my body, yeah, slow
Skip a beat and move with my body, skip a beat and move with my body
Skip a beat and move with my body, slow
