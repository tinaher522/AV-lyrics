<song artist="Kylie_Minogue" title="Timebomb">
Fast, time is ticking now so fast
The sand is running quick right, through our hands
Beat, feel the rhythm in my heart beat
Why don’t you move your body, to my body
Before we disappear
Tell me now
Whoop
Do you wanna, wanna
Whooop
I wanna, wanna
Dance like it was the last dance of my life
I wanna
Whooop
Wanna, wanna, wanna
Whooop
Do you wanna, wanna
Dance like it was the last dance
Wait, no please don’t make me wait
When walls are shaking ground feels, like it might break
It’s not the end of the world
It’s just the start of me and you, yeah
So let’s just take the moment, boy let’s move
Tell me now
Whoop
Do you wanna, wanna
Whooop
I wanna, wanna
Dance like it was the last dance of my life
I wanna
Whooop
Wanna, wanna, wanna
Whooop
Do you wanna, wanna
Dance like it was the last dance
We’re on a time bomb
It might not last long
So let’s just do it right now
Do it, come on
We’re on a time bomb
Before the night’s gone
Let’s just do it right now
Do it, come on, come on
Wait, please don’t make me wait
Wait, please don’t make me wait
Tell me now
Whoop
Do you wanna, wanna
Whooop
I wanna, wanna
Dance like it was the last dance of my life
I wanna
Whooop
Wanna, wanna, wanna
Whooop
Do you wanna, wanna
Dance like it was the last dance
We’re on a time bomb
It might not last long
So let’s just do it right now
Do it come on
We’re on a time bomb
Before the night’s gone
Let’s just do it right now
Do it, come on, come on
