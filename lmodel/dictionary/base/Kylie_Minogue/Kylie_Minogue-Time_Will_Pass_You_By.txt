<song artist="Kylie_Minogue" title="Time_Will_Pass_You_By">
Don't let it pass you baby
Don't let it pass you baby
Don't let it pass you baby
Don't let it pass you baby
Passing seasons over fade away
Into misty clouds of autumn grey 
As I sit here looking at the street
Little figures quickly moving feet
I'm just a pebble on the beach and I
Sit and wonder why
Little people running around
Never knowing why 
Life is just a precious minute baby
Open up your eyes and see it baby 
Give yourself a better chance
Because time will pass you 
Right on by (right on by)
This big old world is spinning like a top
Come and help me now and make it stop
All you have to do is live for now
Come along with me I'll show you how
Take my hand I'll show you how to live
Why wait until tomorrow?
Take my hand I'll lead the way
To a brighter day
Life is just a precious minute baby
Open up your eyes and see it baby 
Give yourself a better chance
Because time will pass you 
Right on by (right on by)
(Don't let it pass you baby) time
Time is gonna pass you by so quickly
And it waits for no man
No no, oh baby 
Life is just a precious minute baby
Open up your eyes and see it baby 
Give yourself a better chance
Because time will pass you 
Right on by (right on by)
Life is just a precious minute baby
Open up your eyes and see it baby 
Give yourself a better chance
Because time will pass you 
Right on by (right on by)
Life is just a precious minute baby
Open up your eyes and see it baby 
Give yourself a better chance
Because time will pass you 
Right on by (right on by)
(Don't let it pass you baby)
Don't let it pass you
Don't let it pass you
Don't let it, don't let it
