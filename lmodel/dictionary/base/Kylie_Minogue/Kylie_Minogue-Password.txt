<song artist="Kylie_Minogue" title="Password">
You've whet my appetite
I want the taste of you tonight
I've got a look on me
Like the cat who's got the cream
Prrr
I take you for a gambling man
I place my bets as high as I can
Maybe you're the one who can realize my dream
Shall we see
Meet me in the bedroom
At quarter past eleven
Say the lucky words I'm looking for
And we'll be locking up the door
Baby, if you wanna be in my world
You've gotta know the password
To make it right
Tell me you're thinking hard
I don't want this to fall apart
I've got a feeling that
We could just make our team
I'm careful with my heart
I'm a fussy girl and love's an art
Tell me that you're hiding
Something up your sleeve
Please
Meet me in the bedroom
At quarter past eleven
Say the lucky words I'm looking for
And we'll be locking up the door
Baby, if you wanna be in my world
You've gotta know the password
To make it right
Baby, if you wanna be in my world
You've gotta know the password
I think you might
Tell me the password baby
Understand I'm a lady
It's not the hand you've got
But how you play it
Baby what's the password
Baby what's the password
