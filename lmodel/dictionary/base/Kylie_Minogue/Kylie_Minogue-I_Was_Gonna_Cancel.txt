<song artist="Kylie_Minogue" title="I_Was_Gonna_Cancel">
I was gonna cancel
Then I looked into the sky and knew
That bad news won't prevent the sun to shine
I was gonna cancel
Then took a sec to realize
All the disappointment that would trail behind
I was gonna cancel
Then you reminded me of who I am
Everything is clearer
Than a mirror is to woman
Just the same as a dog is to man
Just hop out of the bed
Go ahead face the day
Who cares what you know
Don't let that in the way (no way)
Shut out all the doubt
Just get up and go
What's on the other side
You will never know
Unless you go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go girl
I was gonna cancel
Then I thought about the strength
That I got from all of the prayers and what it meant
I was gonna cancel
Then I realized that time is just like
Money and love watch how you spend
I was gonna cancel
Until you reminded me of what I do
Now I see it clearer
My best friend is the mirror
Look behind me and I see all the things I been through
Just hop out of the bed
Go ahead face the day
Who cares what you know
Don't let that in the way (no way)
Shut out all the doubt
Just get up and go
What's on the other side
You will never know
Unless you go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go girl
What's wrong with saying I love you
It's nothing to kid about
Some people going through a struggle
Trying to scribble it out
They say attention is a shovel
It's time to dig 'em out
You can't just let 'em stay in a bubble
They'll pop to get it out
What's wrong with love, love
What's wrong with love, love
Just hop out of the bed
Go ahead face the day
Who cares what you know
Don't let that in the way (no way)
Shut out all the doubt
Just get up and go
What's on the other side
You will never know
Unless you go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go girl
