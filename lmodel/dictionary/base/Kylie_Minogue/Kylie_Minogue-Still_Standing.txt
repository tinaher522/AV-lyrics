<song artist="Kylie_Minogue" title="Still_Standing">
I want you to remember
First kiss you ever had
When our lips met together
I knew that was that
I'm still standing
Keeping you dancing, yeah
You know you want it
I'm still going
Making the party blow
The way you like it
Do you wanna hear me sing pop
'Cause I don't think I wanna stop
(Don't make me stop)
And I love it when my beats drop
Yeah it makes me feel hot
Guess whose back on top
I'll happily surrender
To your desire
A touch so warm and tender
Is setting me on fire
I'm still standing
Keeping you dancing, yeah
You know you want it
I'm still going
Making the party blow
The way you like it
Do you wanna hear me sing pop
'Cause I don't think I wanna stop
(Don't make me stop)
And I love it when my beats drop
Yeah it makes me feel hot
Guess whose back on top
(Funkin' to this sound
We're gonna get down)
(Pop, stop, drop, hot)
Do you wanna hear me sing pop
'Cause I don't think I wanna stop
(Don't make me stop)
And I love it when my beats drop
Yeah it makes me feel hot
Guess whose back on top
Do you wanna hear me sing pop
'Cause I don't think I wanna stop
(Don't make me stop)
And I love it when my beats drop
Yeah it makes me feel hot
Guess whose back on top
Wanna hear me sing pop
Don't think I wanna stop
I love it when my beats drop
It makes me feel hot
