<song artist="Kylie_Minogue" title="Speakerphone">
Music make you lose control
Lights, mind, eyes, hearts
Lights - flashing
Sound - clashing
Mind - blowing
Body - rocking
Eyes - locking
Lips - touching
Hearts - pumping
Pressure - rising
Breath - taking
Rump - shaking
Music - make you
Lose control
Play it on your speaker phone
Track repeat go on and on
Drop your socks
And grab your mini boom box
Do the pop lock
Body rock
Let the beat drop
'Til you're shell shocked
Baby what?
Tell me what you got
Rock hard like a cinderblock
Through your head bone
Tempel bone
Through your jaw bone
To your neck bone
Collar bone
Let it go on
To your back bone
Moving on
Through your hip bone
When you play it on your speaker phone
Track repeat go on and on
Lights - flashing
Sound - clashing
Mind - blowing
Body - rocking
Eyes - locking
Lips - touching
Hearts - pumping
Pressure - rising
Breath - taking
Rump - shaking
Music - make you
Lose control
Play it on your speaker phone
With your friend or on your own
On the street or in your home
Feel the buzz and hum along
Play it on your speaker phone
Let the stars collide
Stop your pockets going
Ring-a-ding-dong
Turn your thing on
Speaker phone
We can get it on
Set your mind on freaky mode
Where you wanna go
Feel the buzz grow let it blow
Through your head bone
Tempel bone
Through your jaw bone
To your neck bone
Collar bone
Let it go on
To your back bone
Moving on
Through your hip bone
When you play it on your speaker phone
Track repeat go on and on
Lights - flashing
Sound - clashing
Mind - blowing
Body - rocking
Eyes - locking
Lips - touching
Hearts - pumping
Pressure - rising
Breath - taking
Rump - shaking
Music - make you
Lose control
Play it on your speaker phone
With your friend or on your own
On the street or in your home
Feel the buzz and hum along
Play it on your speaker phone
Let the stars collide
Drop your socks
And grab your mini boom box
Let the beat drop...
Drop your socks
And grab your mini boom box
Do the pop lock
Body rock
Let the beat drop...
Drop your socks
And grab your mini boom box
Play it on your speaker phone
Lights - flashing
Sound - clashing
Mind - blowing
Body - rocking
Eyes - locking
Lips - touching
Hearts - pumping
Pressure - rising
Breath - taking
Rump - shaking
Music - make you
Lose control
Play it on your speaker phone
Let the stars collide
