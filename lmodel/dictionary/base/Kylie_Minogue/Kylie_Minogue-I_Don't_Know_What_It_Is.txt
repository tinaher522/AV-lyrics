<song artist="Kylie_Minogue" title="I_Don't_Know_What_It_Is">
Can you feel it
Nothing that I do is right
I think I've had an over sight
You don't know what your doing to me
Why do you always put me down
It's better when you're not around
We always seem to disagree
You're killing my love
You're screwing me up
I can't take no more and I've had enough
I can't get it right, I'm choking inside
I love you to death in the afterlife
But I don't know what it is that keeps me going
Can't get enough of this it keeps us flowing
I keep pushing ahead, but you can't stop me now
Took some time to realize
I saw it right before my eyes
That we don't get along anymore
I tried my best to make it work
You always keep me in the dark
And now I'm feeling, oh, so unsure
You're killing my love
You're screwing me up
I can't take no more and I've had enough
I can't get it right I'm choking inside
I love you to death in the afterlife
But I don't know what it is that keeps me going
Can't get enough of this it keeps us flowing
I keep pushing ahead, but you can't stop me now
And I don't know what it is that makes it matter
So tell me what to give to make it better
I keep pushing ahead, but you can't stop me now
Pushin' and a-shovin'
Pushin' and a-shovin'
Pushin' and a-shovin'
Pushin' and a-shovin'
But I don't know what it is that keeps me going
Can't get enough of this it keeps us flowing
I keep pushing ahead, but you can't stop me now
And I don't know what it is that makes it matter
So tell me what to give to make it better
I keep pushing ahead, but you can't stop me now
I don't know what it is...
