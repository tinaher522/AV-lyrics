<song artist="Kylie_Minogue" title="Les_Sex">
We could call it
We could call it
We could call it
We could call it
Les love, les sex, les love oh oh oh
Les love, les sex, les love oh oh oh
Les love, les sex, les love oh oh oh (we could call it)
Les love, les sex, we could call it, call, call it
When we're in the dark
Anything is possible (yeah, yeah, oh)
So dim the light
Slip into something comfortable
'Cause you never know
We could fall to pieces
We could fall in step
We could keep on teasing
We could mine the depths (oh)
We could talk for hours
Or we could make it up
We could call it fleeting
We could call it
Les love, les sex, les drugs, les touch
We could call it fleeting
We could call it, we could call it
Les love, les sex, les hand on les leg
We could call it I don't care
We could call it love
Les love (les love), les sex (les love), les love oh oh oh (we could call it)
Les love (les love), les sex (les love), les love oh oh oh (we could we could call it)
Les love (les love), les sex (les love), les love oh oh oh (we could call it)
Les love (les love), les sex (les love), we could call it love
Take two of these 
And meet me in the shadows (yeah, yeah, oh)
If love's a drug
We're higher than stilettoes
But you never know
We could fall to pieces
We could fall in step
We could keep on teasing
We could mine the depths (oh)
We could talk for hours
Or we could make it up
We could call it fleeting
We could call it
Les love, les sex, les drugs, les touch
We could call it fleeting
We could call it, we could call it
Les love, les sex, les hand on les leg
We could call it I don't care
We could call it love
Les love (les love), les sex (les love), les love oh oh oh (we could call it)
Les love (les love), les sex (les love), les love oh oh oh (we could we could call it)
Les love (les love), les sex (les love), les love oh oh oh (we could call it)
Les love (les love), les sex (les love), we could call it love
Take two of these
And meet me in the shadow
In the dark we don't say no, we say yes please
Take two of these
And meet me in the shadow
We could call it love
Les love, les sex, les drugs, les touch
We could call it fleeting
We could call it, we could call it
Les love, les sex, les hand on les leg
We could call it I don't care
We could call it love
Les love (les love), les sex (les love), les love oh oh oh (we could call it)
Les love (les love), les sex (les love), les love oh oh oh (we could we could call it)
Les love (les love), les sex (les love), les love oh oh oh (we could call it)
Les love (les love), les sex (les love), we could call it love
