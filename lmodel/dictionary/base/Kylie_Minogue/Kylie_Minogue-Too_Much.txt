<song artist="Kylie_Minogue" title="Too_Much">
Got to have it
It's like a shockwave to my brain
Get it together
I've got a headful to explain
It gives me a funny feeling
I've got to find out if it's true
I'd give you the answer baby
I don't know what we're going throughh
It's too much
It's too much
It's too much
This kind of love 
For the first time, for the first time
It's way too much
This kind of love
Not the last time, not the last time
When you read my body
Can you touch my mind
Will we make it happen
Each and every time
They say it doesn't happen
Lightning struck twice
First one got me hot
Last was cold, but nice
Push me to the brim 
And then fill me to the break
I can't function
I can't fake
It's too much
Wooooo
It's too much
This kind of love 
For the first time, for the first time
It's way too much
This kind of love
Not the last time, not the last time
It's too much
This kind of love 
For the first time, for the first time
It's way too much
This kind of love
Not the last time, not the last time
It's too much
This kind of love 
For the first time, for the first time
It's way too much
This kind of love
Not the last time, not the last time
I see what it is
I can't say, I can't say what it is
If I say what I feel it's too much
I can't say, I can't say what it is
If I say what I feel it's too much
I can't say, I can't say what it is
If I say what I feel it's too much
I can't say, I can't say what it is
It's too much
This kind of love 
For the first time, for the first time
It's way too much
This kind of love
Not the last time, not the last time
It's too much
This kind of love 
For the first time, for the first time
It's way too much
This kind of love
Not the last time, not the last time (it's too much)
It's too much
This kind of love 
For the first time, for the first time (it's too much, it's too much baby)
It's way too much
This kind of love
Not the last time (it's too much), the way I feel about you 
(the way I feel about you) it's too much
(the way I feel about you) it's too much
Oh, (the way I feel about you) it's too much
(the way I feel about you) it's too much
