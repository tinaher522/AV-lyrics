<song artist="Kylie_Minogue" title="Cruise_Control">
Top down, get on the wheel
Baby things are better when you just feel
And you do you your own thing
Ah, just let it swing
Drive me to I don't care
I'm enraputured take me anywhere
I just wanna fly
I like this CD
Turn the music up
And baby don't slow down
If you want me
All you gotta do
Is keep me going now
Listen can you give me that
Baby just hit that
Cruise control
Ready, get set, go
You drive me crazy boy
I like it racy boy
On cruise control
We've been on a roll
Feels like the speed of light
Sit back and enjoy the ride
Oh no, the lights go green
Time out, do you know what I mean?
We're all on our own
I ain't going home
Out there I wanna be
No more bumper two bumper cars for me
We're on the highway
Put it on replay
Turn the music up
And baby don't slow down
If you want me
All you gotta do
Is keep me going now
Listen can you give me that
Baby just hit that
Cruise control
Ready, get set, go
You drive me crazy boy
I like it racy boy
On cruise control
We've been on a roll
Feels like the speed of light
Sit back and enjoy the ride
Driving on cruise control
(Baby can you give me that, baby can you hit that)
(Can you give me that, baby can you hit that)
(Can you give me that, baby can you hit that)
(Can you give me that)
(Can you give me that)
(Listen can you give me that, baby just hit that)
One / Two / Three / Four / Five of them 
Situation gettin' really live again 
Girl's dem wanna hang out 
With the players and the riders 
Beside of them and dem say 
Dem tired of the liars 
Dem friars and connivers 
Will never get inside of dem
Dem clyder dem 
Especially the money hider dem 
Watchie watchie girl bout dem
I try to make a bride of dem 
Denied again 
Some of them move like a spiderman 
Girl dem say nah come wide again 
Just hit that
Cruise control
Ready, get set, go
You drive me crazy boy
I like it racy boy
On cruise control
We've been on a roll
Feels like the speed of light
Sit back and enjoy the ride
Just hit that
Cruise control
Ready, get set, go
You drive me crazy boy
I like it racy boy
On cruise control
We've been on a roll
Feels like the speed of light
Sit back and enjoy the ride
Ready, get set, go
You drive me crazy boy
I like it racy boy
On cruise control
We've been on a roll
Feels like the speed of light
Sit back and enjoy the ride
