<song artist="Kylie_Minogue" title="Sexercize">
Flex it real tight
Keep on moving so nice
Move it for me tonight
Let me see you sexercize
It's not just your body
Gotta keep it up with me
My mind is slammin' see
Let me see you sexercize
I wanna see you beat all your best times
And if you're lucky I'ma teach a class that'll turn you blind
Let me see you sexercize
Come on, baby (bounce, bounce)
Sexercize
Feel the burn (ride it out)
Sexercize
Let me see you take it down to the ground
Let me see you pick it up
Let me see you bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce
Let me see you sexercize
Come on, baby (bounce, bounce)
Sexercize
Feel the burn (ride it out)
Sexercize
Let me see you take it down to the ground
Let me see you pick it up
Let me see you bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce
Let me see you
Stretch it out baby
Yeah take your time now
I'm burning patiently
Let me see you sexercize
I'll make you wait for more
Make you ache to the core
Tomorrow you'll be sore
Let me see you sexercize
I wanna see you beat all your best times
And if you're lucky I'ma teach a class that'll turn you blind
Let me see you sexercize
Come on, baby (bounce, bounce)
Sexercize
Feel the burn (ride it out)
Sexercize
Let me see you take it down to the ground
Let me see you pick it up
Let me see you bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce
Let me see you sexercize
Come on, baby (bounce, bounce)
Sexercize
Feel the burn (ride it out)
Sexercize
Let me see you take it down to the ground
Let me see you pick it up
Let me see you bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce
Let me see you
Get it, get it, sexercize
Put your hands in the sky if you're feelin' alright
(Don't quit, don't quit)
If you wanna stay tight
Get it, get it, sexercize, sexercize, sexercize
Get it, get it, sexercize, sexercize, sexercize
Let me see you sexercize
Come on, baby (bounce, bounce)
Sexercize
Feel the burn (ride it out)
Sexercize
Let me see you take it down to the ground
Let me see you pick it up
Let me see you bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce
Let me see you sexercize
Come on, baby (bounce, bounce)
Sexercize
Feel the burn (ride it out)
Sexercize
Let me see you take it down to the ground
Let me see you pick it up
Let me see you bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce
Let me see you
Get it, get it, sexercize
Put your hands in the sky if you're feelin' alright
(Don't quit, don't quit)
If you wanna stay tight
Get it, get it, sexercize, sexercize, sexercize
Get it, get it, sexercize, sexercize, sexercize
