<song artist="Kylie_Minogue" title="If_You_Don't_Love_Me">
You can tell me anything
You can tell me anything
I'll believe you
You know it too
Share the truth with lies
Set aside one flies
Will you realise
If you don't love me
You don't love me
I will know 
If you don't love me
You don't love me
You can ask me anything
You can ask me anything
I will do it
You know it too
Nothing that I'll do
If you want me to
And it's all so true
If you don't love me
You don't love me
I will know 
If you don't love me
You don't love me
I'll know
