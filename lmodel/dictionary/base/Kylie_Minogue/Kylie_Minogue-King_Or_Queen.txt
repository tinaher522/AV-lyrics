<song artist="Kylie_Minogue" title="King_Or_Queen">
You stand around the edge
Looking tip-top but you forget
Then when I look at you
Baby, I see so much more you could do
Oh come to me
You'd look good in company
And your wish is my command
All you've got to do is take my hand
Come to me, come to me
Don't you understand
That body was made for dancing
So follow me down this way
Come on now
Twist it (turn it, turn it)
Push it (burn it, burn it)
Made for dancing, totally designed to shake
So come on now
Twist it (turn it, turn it)
Push it (burn it, burn it)
Dress up, fit the part
Tie your name up on my heart
Don't be so shy about it
Dont get uptight about it
Move close can't you see
You know your gonna feel good next to me
'Cause oh, oh, don't you know
That baby was made for dancing
So follow me down this way
Come on now
Twist it (turn it, turn it)
Push it (burn it, burn it)
Made for dancing totally designed to shake
So come on now
Twist it (turn it, turn it)
Push it (burn it, burn it)
Dancefloor royalty
Famous on the disco scene
Loyalty unquavering
Be my king or queen
King or queen
Famous on the disco scene
Dancefloor royalty
That's what you are to me
I salute you
That body was made for dancing
So follow me down this way
Come on now
Twist it (turn it, turn it)
Push it (burn it, burn it)
Made for dancing totally designed to shake
So come on now
Twist it (turn it, turn it)
Push it (burn it, burn it)
Dancefloor royalty
Famous on the disco scene
Loyalty unquavering
Be my king or queen
