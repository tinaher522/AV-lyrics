<song artist="Kylie_Minogue" title="Your_Love">
Open your eyes to the skies up above
Now is the time to express my love
Want you to hear my confession
You're my obsession
Do what you will do but I can't help the way I feel for you
Your love's got me going around and around
And it's taking me over
Your love's got me tumbling upside down
And I want you to know it
Your love's got me going around and around
And it's taking me over
It's you, you, you, it's only you
Open your eyes to the skies and the sun
I wonder if this day will be the one
Want you to hear my confession
You're my obsession
Do what you will do but I can't help that way I'm wanting you
Your love's got me going around and around
And it's taking me over
Your love's got me tumbling upside down
And I want you to know it
Your love's got me going around and around
And it's taking me over
It's you, you, you, it's only you
It's taken everything I have
To get to here
You can crush my heart
At any moment
But I thought it best you know that
Your love's got me going around and around
And it's taking me over
Your love's got me tumbling upside down
And I want you to know it
Your love's got me going around and around
And it's taking me over
It's you, you, you, it's only you
Your love's got me going around and around
And it's taking me over
Your love's got me tumbling upside down
And I want you to know it
Your love's got me going around and around
And it's taking me over
It's you, you, you, it's only you
