<song artist="Kylie_Minogue" title="No_Better_Love">
Wander in your wilderness
Close enough, take a breath
Closer still, touch your skin
Open up (open up)
Let me in.
Don't you know you're
Taking me down
You're making me high
My life's turned around
Now save me tonight
No Better Love
Than when we make it
To get up and taste it
Intoxication, this elation
Oooh... there's no better love
Follow up my fantasies
So nice, meant to be
Nicer still, what's to come
Take a ride (take a ride)
Come undone
Don't you know you're
Taking me down
You're making me high
My life's turned around
Now save me tonight
No Better Love
Than when we make it
To get up and taste it
Intoxication, this elation
Oooh... there's no better love
No Better Love
Than when we make it
To get up and taste it
Intoxication, this elation
Oooh... there's no better love
Don't you know you're 
Taking me down
You're making me high
My life's turned around
Now save me tonight
Don't you know you're...
No Better Love
Than when we make it
To get up and taste it
Intoxication, this elation
Oooh... there's no better love
No Better Love
No Better Love
Than when we make it
To get up and taste it
Intoxication, this elation
Oooh... there's no better love
No Better Love (to fade)
