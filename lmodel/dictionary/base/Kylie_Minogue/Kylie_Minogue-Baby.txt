<song artist="Kylie_Minogue" title="Baby">
Look at you 
You're coming with the same old lies 
Think you can win me over 
Feels so good 
I've got you working hard this time 
Who's fooling who 
Double-check my smile boy 
I'm only playing along 
You know tonight boy 
I ain't gonna say 
Baby 
Guess you don't mean that much to me 
Now I've got you off my mind 
No baby 
Tell you that word is history 
Just a big mistake I won't repeat again no 
Ain't gonna say ain't gonna say 
Baby 
Ain't gonna say ain't gonna say 
Uh uh 
So you're back 
You've got that look upon your face 
Too bad 
I know you better 
That's OK 'cos now I understand your game 
I just can't lose 
Look in my eyes boy 
You know I'll take you along 
Just for the ride boy 
I ain't gonna say 
Baby 
Guess you don't mean that much to me 
Now I've got you off my mind 
No baby 
Tell you that word is history 
Just a big mistake I won't repeat again no
Ain't gonna say ain't gonna say 
Baby 
Ain't gonna say ain't gonna say 
Got you off my 
Ain't gonna say ain't gonna say 
Baby 
Ain't gonna say ain't gonna say 
Oooh 
Got you off my 
Double-check my smile boy 
I'm only playing along 
You know tonight boy 
I ain't gonna say 
Baby 
Guess you don't mean that much to me 
Now I've got you off my mind 
No baby 
Tell you that word is history 
Just a big mistake I won't repeat again no 
Baby 
Guess you don't mean that much to me 
Now I've got you off my mind 
No baby 
Tell you that word is history 
Just a big mistake I won't repeat again no
