<song artist="Kylie_Minogue" title="Flower">
Wrapped in a blanket of hope
Asleep in a bed of dreams
My step into eternity
Is not what it might have been
Or not at all
For who knows
Which way the wind is gonna blow
I'm waiting for your gentle whisper
Distant child, my flower
Are you blowing in the breeze
Can you feel me
As I breathe life into you
In a while, my flower
Somewhere in a desert haze
I know one day, you'll amaze me
An act of balancing, imagining
The moment I can be
Looking deep into your eyes
For now, a mystery
Or not at all
For who knows
Which way the wind is gonna blow
I'm waiting for your gentle whisper
Distant child, my flower
Are you blowing in the breeze
Can you feel me
As I breathe life into you
In a while, my flower
Somewhere in a desert haze
I know one day, you'll amaze me
Two hearts
In the hands of time
Your love bleeds into mine
I'll be with you forever
And give you everything I am
Want you to understand
It's you and I together
Distant child, my flower
Are you blowing in the breeze
Can you feel me
As I breathe life into you
In a while, my flower
Somewhere in a desert haze
I know one day, you'll amaze me
