<song artist="Kylie_Minogue" title="Automatic_Love">
Won't you please forgive me I feel a stranger here
It seems I've lost all my memories and all of my fears
I know I'm so crazy, I don't care
'cause it's you that makes me so beware
You put me on, automatic love, there's no return
I'm on automatic love nothing can stop me
I'm on automatic love come on and turn it on
Automatic, automatic
I didn't feel you enter in my main menu
But every time I touch the key the screen is showing you
I know I'm so crazy, I don't care
'cause it's you that makes me so beware
You put me on, automatic love, there's no return
I'm on automatic love nothing can stop me
I'm on automatic love come on and turn it on
Automatic, automatic
No manual control
It's automatic
So beware, you put me on automatic love
Automatic love
Nothing can stop me, I'm on automatic love
Come on and turn it on
Come on, turn it on
