<song artist="Kylie_Minogue" title="Koocachoo">
No-one else I know can thrill me like you do
I only ever want to go-go dance with you
You're the dream boy of my bedroom poster
Now we're on a roller coaster ride
You're the greatest gift that I could ever wish for
And there's not a single thing I wouldn't give for
A little time with you, my koocachoo
'cause I'm so in love with you
No-one else can take me to the highs like you
You show me all the colours when I am feeling blue
You're the brightest shining lights on Broadway
Pink in evening sunsets every day
You're the greatest gift that I could ever wish for
And there's not a single thing I wouldn't give for
A little time with you, my koocachoo
'cause I'm so in love with you
Even at night when I'm sleeping
You are all I'm ever dreaming of
You're the greatest gift that I could ever wish for
And there's not a single thing I wouldn't give for
A little time with you, my koocachoo
'cause I am so in love with you
