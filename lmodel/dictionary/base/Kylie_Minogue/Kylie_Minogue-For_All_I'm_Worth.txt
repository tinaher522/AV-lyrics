<song artist="Kylie_Minogue" title="For_All_I'm_Worth">
Who's telling me
Who's wrong or right
When I don't come home at night
No mother
No lover
I'm finished with cold claims on me
I'm not what you want me to be
No way, hear what I say
Don't keep me apart
Ooohhh from the one I love
Don't keep me apart
Don't keep me apart
From the one I love
Just let me be
Just let me be
Just let me be
Just let me be
For all I'm worth
For all I'm worth
Who's telling us about the babies?
Don't you think it's up to the ladies?
Don't confuse us or abuse us
I don't allow some power freak
To make me feel small and weak
No way, hear what i say
Don't keep me apart
Ooohhh from the one I love
Don't keep me apart
Don't keep me apart
From the one I love
Just let me be
Just let me be
Just let me be
Just let me be
For all I'm worth
For all I'm worth
Don't keep me apart
Ooohhh from the one I love
Don't keep me apart
Don't keep me apart
From the one I love
Just let me be
Just let me be
Just let me be
Just let me be
For all I'm worth
For all I'm worth
Just let me be
For all I'm worth
