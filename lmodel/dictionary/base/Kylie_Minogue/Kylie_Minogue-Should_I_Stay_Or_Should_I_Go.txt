<song artist="Kylie_Minogue" title="Should_I_Stay_Or_Should_I_Go">
Darling you gotta let me know
Should I stay or should I go?
If you say that you'll be mine
I'll be here till the end of time
Well come on and let me know
Should I stay or should I go?
It's always tease tease tease
You're happy when I'm on my knees
One day is fine, the next is black
If you want me off your back
Well come on and let me know
Should I stay or should I go?
Should I stay or should I go now?
Should I stay or should I go now?
If I go there will be trouble
And if I stay it will be double
Well you've got to let me know
This indecision's bugging me
If you don't love me, set me free
Exactly whom I'm supposed to be
Don't you know which clothes even fit me?
Well come on and let me know
Should I cool it or should I blow?
Should I stay or should I go now?
Should I stay or should I go now?
If I go there will be trouble
And if I stay it will be double
Well you've got to let me know
Should I stay or should I go?
Should I stay or should I go?
Should I stay or should I go now?
If I go there will be trouble
And if I stay it will be double
Well you've got to let me know
Should I cool it or should I blow?
