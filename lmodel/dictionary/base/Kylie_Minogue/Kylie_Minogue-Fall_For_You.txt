<song artist="Kylie_Minogue" title="Fall_For_You">
Didn't know the risk I'm taking
Cos' I know all the rules I'm breaking are all for you
Never gonna let go, cos you know
I can't believe I'm falling
In love another time
How long have you been calling
My heart up on the line
So why did you go settin' off the alarms
Screaming out load, can't resist your charms
Hard as I try can't ignore it or runaway
I will fall for you baby
And why did go set your aim on me
Try to make it cool but there's chemistry
I'm in a fix and I'm finding it hard, I couldn't say
I will fall for you baby
Didn't know the risk I'm taking
Cos' I know all the rules I'm breaking are all for you
Never gonna let go, cos you know
I can't believe I'm falling
In love another time
How long have you been calling

My heart up on the line
So why did you go settin' off the alarms
Screaming out load, can't resist your charms
Hard as I try can't ignore it or runaway
I will fall for you baby
And why did go set your aim on me
Try to make it cool but there's chemistry
I'm in a fix and I'm finding it hard, I couldn't say 
I will fall for you baby
So why did you go settin' off the alarms
Screaming out load, can't resist your charms
Hard as I try can't ignore it or runaway
I will fall for you baby
And why did go set your aim on me
Try to make it cool but there's chemistry
I'm in a fix and I'm finding it hard, I couldn't say
I will fall for you baby
And why did go set your aim on me
Try to make it cool but there's chemistry
I'm in a fix and I'm finding it hard, couldn't say 
I will fall for you baby
