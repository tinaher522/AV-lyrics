Yeah
Just listen
Oooh, oooh
It's got to be time that I put my foot down
You push me and pull me with those games your playin'
And you know what goes around comes around
'Cause I started hearing all the words they're saying
You're so conceited
I won't be cheated 
Just listen
One little push and you're gone
Everytime the cat's away
All the boys come out to play
It's bad behaviour
But I like the flavour
A little bird told me it's true
So I do it back to you
Nice girls don't do it 
But you push me too it
Ooohh oooooh ha ha ha
I'm needing some liberation 
Set me free
You tried to control me 
But I'm disobeying
I'm tired of you giving me the third degree
When I've got a lead on you to stop you strayin'
You're so conceited 
I won't be cheated
Just listen
One little push and you're gone
Everytime the cat's away
All the boys come out to play
It's bad behaviour 
But I like the flavour
A little bird told me it's true
So I do it back to you
Nice girls don't do it
But you pushed me to it
Everytime the cat's away
All the boys come out to play
It's bad behaviour 
But I like the flavour
A little bird told me it's true
So I do it back to you
Nice girls don't do it
But you pushed me to it
Ooohh oooooh ha ha ha
Ooohh oooooh ha ha ha
Ooohh oooooh ha ha ha
Ooohh oooooh ha ha ha
Everytime the cat's away
All the boys come out to play
It's bad behaviour 
But I like the flavour
A little bird told me it's true
So I do it back to you
Nice girls don't do it
But you push me to it
Ooohh oooooh ha ha ha
Everytime the cat's away
A little bird told me its true
Everytime the cat's away
A little bird told me its true
Everytime the cat's away
A little bird told me its true
