<song artist="Kylie_Minogue" title="Sensitized">
Sensitized by every word that you say
Boy you got me messed up
But I like it that way
Tantalised just too good to refuse
When I try to stop ya
You keep blowing my fuse
Can't deny how hot I'm feeling
If my body could fly I'd hit the ceiling
'Cause I can't hold back the minute I try
Baby you trip the switch and I'm sensitized
Every touch whatever you do baby you trip the switch
I turn on for you
I turn on for you
Energised by all the pleasure and pain
Boy you got that something that burns a spark to a flame
Look at me you've got me begging for more
'Cause you got that one thing I ain't discovered before
Can't deny how rude I'm feeling
If my body could talk you'd hear me screaming
'Cause I can't hold back the minute I try
Baby you trip the switch and I'm sensitized
Every touch whatever you do baby you trip the switch
I turn on for you
I turn on for you
I'm sensitized tonight and you can watch me come alive
I'm sensitized tonight and you can watch me come alive
I'm sensitized tonight and you can watch me come alive
I'm sensitized tonight I'm sensitized tonight
I can't hold back the minute I try
Baby you trip the switch and I'm sensitized
Every touch whatever you do baby you trip the switch
I turn on for you
I turn on for you
I can't hold back the minute I try
Baby you trip the switch and I'm sensitized
Every touch whatever you do baby you trip the switch
I turn on for you
I turn on for you
I come alive
Baby and you know it's true I feel this for you
I come alive
Baby and you know it's true I feel this for you
