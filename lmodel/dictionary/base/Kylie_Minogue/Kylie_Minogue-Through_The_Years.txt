<song artist="Kylie_Minogue" title="Through_The_Years">
This fever I have is because of you
My body is blazing
The flames alight and lick at my ear
So that I can only hear
Muddled words of you
Through the years
Too many a trusted word was said
My body was porous
I savoured every drop of you
Took it all as true
Now I wander my way
Through the years
Through the years
Oooh, you blinded me with all your light
I wish I could see now
Promises and lies ignite the fire
And I wonder why
I believed in you
Through the years
Through the years
Through the years
Of joy and laughter
Of tears and sadness
Of hopes and hearts
Through the years
Of love and loving
Of hurt and healing
Falling apart
I believed in you
I believed in you
I believed in you
And I wonder, wonder why
I'm no longer fooled by your disguise
I'm sorry that you are (sorry that you are)
I pity all pretensions of you
Now I start anew
I wish my way
Through the years
Through the years
Through the years
Through the years
Through the years
