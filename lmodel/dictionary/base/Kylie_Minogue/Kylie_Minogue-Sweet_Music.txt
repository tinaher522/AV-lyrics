<song artist="Kylie_Minogue" title="Sweet_Music">
New sensation, new sensation, new sensation
Check out this groove are you walking on air
Going into a new dimension, yeah
So put your vibes on my beat
And we'll lay it down like that
Slap the high hat in
Put the fairlight on the track
And we can get
Crazy like that
Feel it like that
Move it like that
Drop it like that
Rocking the track
I'm looking for that new sensation
Woohoo
I think we're onto something
Your taste it mirrors mine
So hot and in the moment
Let's beat this demo right
Or I might just lose it
Woohoo
When we make sweet music
No feather bed, no exotic affair, yeah
Got samples and scratches let's do it right here
Cause every heart beat, babe, is the sound track to your life
And every mad effect must be sent to get me high
And we can get
Crazy like that
Feel it like that
Move it like that
Drop it like that
Rocking the track
I'm looking for that new sensation
Woohoo
I think we're onto something
Your taste it mirrors mine
So hot and in the moment
Lets beat this demo right
Or I might just lose it
Woohoo
When we make sweet music
When we make sweet music
When we make sweet music
When we make sweet music
When we make sweet music
I think we're onto something
Your taste it mirrors mine
So hot and in the moment
Let's beat this demo right
Or I might just lose it
When we make sweet music
And we can get
Crazy like that
Feel it like that
Move it like that
Drop it like that
Rocking the track
I'm looking for that new sensation
Woohoo
I think we're onto something
Your taste it mirrors mine
So hot and in the moment
Let's beat this demo right
Or I might just lose it
Woohoo
When we make sweet music
Woohoo
I think we're onto something
Your taste it mirrors mine
So hot and in the moment
Let's beat this demo right
Or I might just lose it
Woohoo
When we make sweet music
When we make sweet music
When we make sweet music
