<song artist="Kylie_Minogue" title="Put_Youself_In_My_Place">
Ooh, haa, I can't take this situation
It's makin' me feel so blue
One moment you walk into my life
And now you're sayin' that we're through
I hear that you're in love now
Babe, I don't know what to say
I can't believe, I still feel this way, yeah
I hear that you're in love now
Babe, I don't know what to say
But before you decide you won't be mine
Put yourself in my place
Circle will come around
You gotta put yourself
In my place
When your lovers bring you down
There's no one else around
You gotta put yourself
In my place
There's no rhyme or reason
That keeps me playin' along
I guess that I'll just keep on believin'
Inside you, love will know right from wrong
Babe, I don't know what to say
I can't believe, I still feel this way, yeah
I hear that you're in love now
Babe, I don't know what to say
But before you decide, you won't be mine
Put yourself in my place
Circle will come around
You gotta put yourself
In my place
When your lovers bring you down
There's no one else around
You gotta put yourself
In my place, hey
Circle will come around
You gotta put yourself
In my place
When your lovers bring you down
There's no one else around
You gotta put yourself
In my place
Circle will come around
You gotta put yourself
In my place
When your lovers bring you down
There's no one else around
You gotta put yourself
In my place
