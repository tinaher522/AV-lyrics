<song artist="Kylie_Minogue" title="Like_A_Drug">
Boy, yeah you got it, got it
You've got me feelin' crazy 'bout my body
I, I cannot, cannot stop it
You got me movin' got me rockin', rockin'
Make me feel like I could make it real
You got me hooked, get me on the floor
If I'm a tease and you're the one to please
I want more
Make me feel like I could make it real
You got me hooked, get me on the floor
If I'm a tease and you're the one to please
I want more
Dance like I'm the only, only
Like I'm the only lady like you want me
Damn right, I have my radar on you
So let's get physical, I want to want to
Make me feel like I could make it real
You got me hooked, get me on the floor
If I'm a tease and you're the one to please
I want more
I never had a ride, as delicate and fine
You really blow my mind
When we rock, when we rock
I really wanna do, everything with you
The things you make me do
Like a drug, like a drug
Like a drug, like a drug
Like a drug, like a drug
Make me feel like I could make it real
You got me hooked, get me on the floor
If I'm a tease and you're the one to please
I want more
Make me feel like I could make it real
You got me hooked, get me on the floor
If I'm a tease and you're the one to please
I want more
I never had a ride, as delicate and fine
You really blow my mind
I really wanna do, everything with you
The things you make me do
Like a drug, like a drug
Like a drug, like a drug
Like a drug, like a drug
Like a drug, like a drug
