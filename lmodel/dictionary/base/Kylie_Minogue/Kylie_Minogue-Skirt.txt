<song artist="Kylie_Minogue" title="Skirt">
Mmmm, shake it
Mmmm, shake it
I can do this all night
All those things you like
Got you high as a kite
Like the way I shake it
Let’s get outta here come on
Where’s your car? Take me home
Up the stairs, close the door
Mmmm
And then my skirt came
Down, down, down, down
And then my skirt came
Down, down, down, down
Mmmm
Down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down
Shake it
Down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down
And then my skirt came
Let’s get outta here come on
Let’s get outta here come on
Let’s get outta here come on
Let’s get outta here come on
Let’s get outta here come on
Let’s get outta here come on
Let’s get outta here come on
Aahhhh
And then my skirt came
Tonight be my supernova
Take whatever you want
Tonight let me bask in you
Like rays of the sun
Tonight I’m yours
Tonight we’re one (we're one)
And then my skirt came
Down, down, down, down (hey)
Down, down, down, down (hey)
Down, down, down, down (hey)
Down, down, down
And then my skirt came
Like the way I, shake it
Like the way I, shake it
Like the way I, shake it
Like the way I, shake it
Like the way I, shake it
Like the, like the, like the
That’s why my skirt came
That’s why my skirt came
That’s why my skirt came
And then my skirt came down
Tonight be my supernova
Take whatever you want
Tonight let me bask in you
Like rays of the sun
Tonight I’m yours
Tonight we’re one
We’re one, we’re one
