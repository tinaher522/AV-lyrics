<song artist="Kylie_Minogue" title="Spell_Of_Desire">
Yeah I know that two hearts collide
If you need such a suffering pain
I was there before now I'm here again
I'm a sucker for love
La la lalalalala
I walk right into temptation
And I can't get enough
La la lalalalala
I'm addicted to this sensation
So tell me
So tell me how, tell me where, tell me when you want it
And I'll arrange the stars around, oh oh oh
Tell me truth, tell me lies, tell me how you feel it
The universe is ours tonight
Tell me now, tell me deep, tell me in the moment
My heart is like it's made of fire
Could be right, could be wrong, or about to burn me
Got me in this spell of desire, desire
I know that I'm helplessly crazy
I fall and I cannot explain
Why I do, it's like a lock and a key
You open the door and I'm running free
I'm a sucker for love
La la lalalalala
I walk right into temptation
And I can't get enough
La la lalalalala
I'm addicted to this sensation
So tell me
So tell me how, tell me where, tell me when you want it
And I'll arrange the stars around, oh oh oh
Tell me truth, tell me lies, tell me how you feel it
The universe is ours tonight
Tell me now, tell me deep, tell me in the moment
My heart is like it's made of fire
Could be right, could be wrong, or about to burn me
Got me in this spell of desire, desire
So tell me how, tell me where, tell me when you want it
And I'll arrange the stars around, oh oh oh
Tell me truth, tell me lies, tell me how you feel it
The universe is ours tonight
Tell me now, tell me deep, tell me in the moment
My heart is like it's made of fire
Could be right, could be wrong, or about to burn me
Got me in this spell of desire, desire

So tell me how, tell me where, tell me when you want it
And I'll arrange the stars around, oh oh oh
Tell me truth, tell me lies, tell me how you feel it
The universe is ours tonight
Tell me now, tell me deep, tell me in the moment
My heart is like it's made of fire
Could be right, could be wrong, or about to burn me
Got me in this spell of desire, desire
