<song artist="Kylie_Minogue" title="If_I_Was_Your_Lover">
You take a piece of me every time you leave
And never realize that way I feel about you
My tongue gets tied and my mouth gets dry
I wanna tell you but I don't know how to
But through every night I dream
Hope and pray and believe
That someday you and I will live in ecstasy
The world for you and me
One love, one life
Everything would be alright if I was your lover
One soul, one life'
Everything would be alright if I was your lover
Another day goes by and it blows my mind
If I didn't know that you were meant for me
Under the moonlit night when the time is right
You hold me in your arms from here to infinity
But through every night I dream
Hope and pray and believe
That someday you and I will live in ecstasy
The world for you and me
One love, one life
Everything would be alright if I was your lover
One soul, one life'
Everything would be alright if I was your lover
If I was your lover I'd hold you in my arms from dusk 'til Dawn 
If I was your lover one night would last for eternity if we were together
But every night I dream
Hope and pray and believe, yeah
So happy cause you're mine
We'll live in ecstasy , the world for you and me
One love, one life
Everything would be alright if I was your lover
One soul, one life'
Everything would be alright if I was your lover
One love, one life
Everything would be alright if I was your lover
One soul, one life'
Everything would be alright if I was your lover
