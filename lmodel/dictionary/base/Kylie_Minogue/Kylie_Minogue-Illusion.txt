<song artist="Kylie_Minogue" title="Illusion">
A situation taking over me
Can't you see
I'm in trouble
Infatuaton's got a hold on me
A little jealousy
I'm not myself at all
I'm surrounded by confusion
And I'm lost in this illusion
You serenade me at the bar
Hiding from it all
Behind a disguise
Who's the man who's at the masquerade
I wish I had a stay
Just to drown in lies
Like a hand-out of a magazine
Are you what you see?
Because I'm losing my belief
Can I make it when there's so much doubt
Someone help me out!
'Cause I'm in to deep
I'm surrounded by confusion
And I'm lost in this illusion
Follow my dreams
Into distant lands
Blowing in the winds
Over shifting sands
I'm in too deep!
I'm surrounded by confusion
And I'm lost in this illusion
(Ohhhhh)
I'm surrounded by confusion
(Ohhhh)
I'm so lost in this illusion
