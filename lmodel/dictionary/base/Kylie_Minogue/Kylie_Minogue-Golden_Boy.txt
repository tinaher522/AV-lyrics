<song artist="Kylie_Minogue" title="Golden_Boy">
Here we are again
Dancing in the dark
All the flashing lights
Bend me a spark
I wanna know your name
It's deep miles down
I wanna take off of me
Gone for a while
No steps retraced
3,000 miles
There’s no more room for mistakes
Now I’m banging on your door
Just like four up on the floor
This is happening too soon
Why are we battling the moon?
You are my golden boy, you are my golden boy, you are my golden boy
Now I’m banging on your door
Just like four up on the floor
This is happening too soon
Why are we battling the moon?
You are my golden boy, you are my golden boy, you are my golden boy
I wanna know your name
I’m lost in the dark
There’s no one to blame
It’s always deep when it’s dark
Here we go again
Midnight to dawn
I forgot your name
And now everything’s gone
Everything’s gone, everything’s gone
There’s no more room for mistakes
Now I’m banging on your door
Just like four up on the floor
This is happening too soon
Why are we battling the moon?
You are my golden boy, you are my golden boy, you are my golden boy
Now I’m banging on your door
Just like four up on the floor
This is happening too soon
Why are we battling the moon?
You are my golden boy, you are my golden boy, you are my golden boy
Now I’m banging on your door
Just like four up on the floor
This is happening too soon
Why are we battling the moon?
You are my golden boy, you are my golden boy, you are my golden boy
Now I’m banging on your door
Just like four up on the floor
This is happening too soon
Why are we battling the moon?
You are my golden boy, you are my golden boy, you are my golden boy
