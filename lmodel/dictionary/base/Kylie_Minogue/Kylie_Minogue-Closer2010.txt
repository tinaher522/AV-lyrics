<song artist="Kylie_Minogue" title="Closer2010">
We'll redesign
Where we combine
To be divine
Love in us
Give me the sign
In these confines
We start to shine
Love in us
Closer and closer and closer
To you now
Never enough
Closer and closer you pull me
Give me more
Soft and slow
We are breathing the same
We are moving the same
And we were
And we are
We're free-designed
Become aligned
We are combined
Love in us
Closer and closer and closer
To you now
Never enough
Closer and closer you pull me
Give me more
Soft and slow
Closer and closer you pull me
Give me more
Soft and slow
