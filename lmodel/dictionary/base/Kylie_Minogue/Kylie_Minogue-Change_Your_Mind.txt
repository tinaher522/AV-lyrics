<song artist="Kylie_Minogue" title="Change_Your_Mind">
Four in the morning
Feeling more than this
We tango together
It's such a beautiful miss
I can remember
What it was you said
It made me feel emotions
That are better to forget
I don't want real love
It'll never be the rush I'd like
But you don't have to change your mind
(You don't have to change)
Real love, had enough
Want to live another kind of life
But you don't have to change your mind
No, you don't have to...
Everytime you kiss me
There's a shadow across my heart
A leads to an ending
I don't wanna start
Don't worry about me
I'm right where I belong
I'm better off all by myself
But you might prove me wrong
(You don't have to change)
I don't want real love
It'll never be the rush I'd like
But you don't have to change your mind
(You don't have to change)
Real love, had enough
Want to live another kind of life
But you don't have to change your mind
You don't have to change, change
You don't have to change
I don't want real love (you don't have to change, change)
I don't want real love
You don't have to change your mind
You don't have to change your mind
