<song artist="Kylie_Minogue" title="More_More_More">
Give it up, give it up 
I just can't get enough
more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more
Here am I with my desire
Feel it burning just for you
My, oh my, this love divine 
Is taking me to somewhere new
Just slide (just slide)
Get your body down, down, down
And glide (and glide)
I gotta feel you all around
Boy you got me wanting more, more, more
Give it all up for love babe
You got me saying more, more, more
Wind me up, wind me up
You know I want you 
More, more, more
Gotta give it all up for love, babe
Keep me saying more, more, more 
Baby just fill me up to the top
Till I can't take no more
No more
Here am I and deep inside 
I got a little spot for you
Oo, make me sigh with sheer delight
As baby you caress and soothe
So Slide (just slide)
I want to feel you down, down, down
And glide (and glide)
You know I need you all around 	
Oh you got me wanting more, more, more
Give it all up for love babe
You got me saying more, more, more
Wind me up, wind me up
You know I want you 
More, more, more
Gotta give it all up for love, babe
Keep me saying more, more, more 
Oooh, baby just fill me up to the top
Till I can't take no more
Till I can't take no more
Ooh, give it up, give it up 
I just can't get enough
So give me more, more, more, more, more (x2)
Just slide (just slide) 
I want your body down, down, down
And glide 
I gotta feel you all around 
Boy you got me wanting more, more, more
Give it all up for love babe
You got me saying more, more, more
Come on and wind me up, wind me up
You know I want you 
More, more, more
Gotta give it all up for love, babe
Keep me saying more, more, more 
Oooh, baby just fill me up to the top
Till I can't take no more
Saying more, more, more, more
More
Give it up, give it up 
I just can't get enough
So give me more, more, more, more, more (x2)
Oooh! Hey hey
Come and give me 
more, more, more (x8)
