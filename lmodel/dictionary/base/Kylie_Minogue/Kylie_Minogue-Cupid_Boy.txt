<song artist="Kylie_Minogue" title="Cupid_Boy">
If only you knew
The shimmer for you
Oh, the very thrill of it
I'm hooked on your line
Under your spell
Your love is king
You colour me gold
And now that you know
Baby, you've got all of me
I'm hooked on your line
You're under my skin
I need your touch
So why don't you thrill me
Like you did before?
Why don't you give me
A little bit more?
Why don't you call me?
Start hittin' me up
Hittin' me up
Hittin' me up
Give me your love
You've got it all stored up
And it feels so good
I could never get enough
You've got the good stuff (good stuff)
Cupid boy,
When we touch
I'm in heaven in your arms
Fire it up
The way you love
Feels like heaven in your arms
Skyrocket to Mars
Straight through to your heart
Every time we touch,
I'm shootin' the stars
Cupid boy,
When we touch,
I'm in heaven
Cupid Boy
I'm losing my grip
I'm letting it slip
Baby, I want all of you
You're reeling me in
Every time I give in
I'm addicted
So why don't you thrill me
Like you did before
Why don't you give me
A little bit more
Why don't you call me
Start hittin' me up
Hittin' me up
Hittin' me up
Give me your love
Give me your love
You got it all stored up
And it feels so good
I could never get enough
(Baby) You've got the good stuff (good stuff)
Cupid boy,
When we touch
I'm in heaven in your arms
Fire it up
The way you love
Feels like heaven in your arms
Skyrocket to Mars
Straight through to your heart
Every time we touch,
I'm shootin' the stars
Cupid boy,
When we touch,
I'm in heaven
Cupid boy (x3)
I couldn't ever get enough
You've got the good stuff (good stuff)
Cupid boy,
When we touch
I'm in heaven in your arms
Fire it up
The way you love
Feels like heaven in your arms
Skyrocket to Mars
Straight through to your heart
Every time we touch,
I'm shootin' the stars
Cupid boy,
When we touch,
I'm in heaven
