<song artist="Kylie_Minogue" title="Beautiful">
Both
You, you are so beautiful
Enrique Iglesias
Used to be, you and me, love like no other
Kylie Minogue
The world around, could fall apart, but we had each other
Both
Saw you walking, you were smiling, and it hit me like the first time
Feels like yesterday has come and gone, but nothing's changed when I look at you
You, you are so beautiful
You, you are so beautiful
And now I, I just want you to know
That after all this time, you're still the one
So hard sometimes, love on the line, but we said forever (yeah)
Sailing on, through the storms, but we held together
And now I, I just want you to know
That after all this time, you're still the one
You, you are so beautiful
You, you are so beautiful
And now I, I just want you to know
That after all this time, you're still the one
You, you are so beautiful
You, you are so beautiful
