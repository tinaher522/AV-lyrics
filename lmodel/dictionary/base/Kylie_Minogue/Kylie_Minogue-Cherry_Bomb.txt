<song artist="Kylie_Minogue" title="Cherry_Bomb">
The suspense is wild
The more I think of you
The more I melt like ice cream
Baby, 'cause the heat of you
Has got me cravin'
And there's nothin' I can do (do)
And the feeling won't stop
'Cause I'm fire red hot
Like I'm ready to pop
It's a kinda excitement
I cannot explain
Oh, here I go again
I can feel it coming
And it's like a flash of night
Inside theres something going on
Exploding inside me like a cherry bomb
And the thought of you
Fills me with a sweet surprise
Come to me tonight (babe, babe)
I'm feeling dynamite (babe, babe)
My heart is a delicious cherry bomb
Oh, these thoughts are killer 
They sit on the tip of my tongue 
Like a cube of sugar 
Got a rush and I can't get enough 
'Cause there's somethin' about you 
Got me deep in love (love) 
And the feeling won't stop
'Cause I'm fire red hot
Like I'm ready to pop
And I'm spinning around
With this passion I found
Oh here I go again
I can feel it coming
And it's like a flash of night
Inside theres something going on
Exploding inside me like a cherry bomb
And the thought of you
Fills me with a sweet surprise
Come to me tonight (babe, babe)
I'm feeling dynamite (babe, babe)
My heart is a delicious cherry bomb 
Cherry bomb,bomb
Cherry bomb
Ooh ooh,ooh ooh,ooohhh
Cherry bomb
Ooh ooh,ooh ooh,ooohhh
Ooh ooh,ooh ooh,ooohhh
Cherry bomb
And it's like a flash of night
Inside theres something going on
Exploding inside me like a cherry bomb
And the thought of you
Fills me with a sweet surprise
Come to me tonight (babe, babe)
I'm feeling dynamite (babe, babe)
My heart is a delicious cherry bomb
