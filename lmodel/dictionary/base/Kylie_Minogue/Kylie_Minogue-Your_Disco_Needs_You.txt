<song artist="Kylie_Minogue" title="Your_Disco_Needs_You">
Your disco, your disco,
Your disco needs you!
Your disco, your disco,
Your disco needs you!
Desperately seeking someone
Willing to travel
You're lost in conversation and
Useless at Scrabble
Happiness will never last
Darkness comes to kick your ass
So let's dance through all of this
War is over for a bit
The whole world should be moving
Do your part
Cure a lonely heart
Your disco, your disco,
Your disco needs you!
Your disco, your disco,
Your disco needs you!
We're sold on vanity
But that's so see-through
Take your body to the floor
Your disco needs you
From Soho to Singapore
From the mainland to the shore
So let's dance through all of this
War is over for a bit
You're a slave to the rhythm
Do your part
Cure a lonely heart
Vous netes jamais seuls
Vous savez ce qu'il faut faire
Ne laissez pas tomber votre nation
La disco a besoin de vous
So let's dance through all of this
War is over for a bit
The whole world should be moving
Do your part
Cure a lonely heart
Your disco, your disco,
Your disco needs you!
Your disco, your disco,
Your disco needs you!
