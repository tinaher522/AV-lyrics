<song artist="Kylie_Minogue" title="Tightrope">
There's so much I want to share
For so long I've been too scared
To show the way I feel for you
But I know what I have to do
So I'm just gonna say it, say it
Love is like a game
And I'm gonna play it, play it
I hope you feel the same
I'm in so deep, can't think and I can't sleep
I'm high upon a tightrope and it always leads to you
These days I find you're always on my mind
I'm high upon a tightrope and I've got to get to you
Wonna take you by the hand
When we touch you'll understand
That there's a love I can't deny
And it's too much to keep inside
So I'm just gonna say it, say it
Love is like a game
And I'm gonna play it, play it
I hope you feel the same
I'm in so deep, can't think and I cant sleep
I'm high upon a tightrope and it always leads to you
These days I find you're always on my mind
I'm high upon a tightrope and I've got to get to you
No more time should pass us by
Don't ask how I know it but this time
Is made for you and I
(Say it)
I'm in so deep, can't think and I can't sleep
I'm high upon a tightrope and I've got to get to, got to get to you
These days I find you're always on my mind
I'm high upon a tightrope and I've got to get to you
I'm in so deep, can't think and I can't sleep
I'm high upon a tightrope and I've got to get to, got to get to you
These days I find you're always on my mind
I'm high upon a tightrope and I've got to get to you
