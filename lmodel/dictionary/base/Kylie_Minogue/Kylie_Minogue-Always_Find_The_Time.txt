<song artist="Kylie_Minogue" title="Always_Find_The_Time">
You're the first thing in the morning
And the last thing at night
And I'll always hear you calling
You're always on my mind
I don't want no-one but you, ooh ooh
And I don't need a second string
I don't want a share of you, ooh, ooh
I wanna be your everything
Sunrise - as long as you'll be mine
Midnight - that would be just fine
Rain or shine - it wouldn't change my mind
I-I-I-always find the time
Look around me
I can always see your face
There's a feeling that's surrounding
It's in every move you make
All the other guys I see, ooh ohh
They don't get a second chance
Funny they don't interest me, ohh ohh
I don't give them a second glance
Sunrise - as long as you'll be mine
Midnight - that would be just fine
Rain or shine - it wouldn't change my mind
I-I-I-always find the time
Sunrise - as long as you'll be mine
Midnight - that would be just fine
Rain or shine - it wouldn't change my mind
I-I-I-always find the time
I don't want no-one but you, ooh ooh
And I don't need a second string
I don't want a share of you, ooh, ooh
I wanna be your everything
Sunrise - as long as you'll be mine
Midnight - that would be just fine
Rain or shine - it wouldn't change my mind
I-I-I-always find the time
