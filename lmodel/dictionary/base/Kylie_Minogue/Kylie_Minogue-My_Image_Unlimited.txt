Oh, here we go again
Seems I'm back and smilin'
Are you talkin' 'bout my new boyfriend?
Or 'bout how I got the other guy way back then?
You did it, you didn't miss it
Went to the newstand and you bought it
You caught it, you watched it
Everywhere it was broad cast
There's always enough of me to go around
(My image unlimited)
Oh, that's how my story goes
But you already know
I'm stuck in your head
(My image unlimited)
Oh, you must like what you see
I make it look easy
Over your cup of tea
(My image unlimited)
I'm into continental
Or sometimes sentimental
Never ever accidental
Do it, the purest
Do you know who for sure is?
Think my life's a fantasy
Fascinated what they see about me
My heart's a breakin'
Oh who I'm dating
You know before I do
What I'm sayin'
There's always enough of me to go around
(My image unlimited)
Oh, that's how my story goes
But you already know
I'm stuck in your head
(My image unlimited)
Oh, you must like what you see
I make it look easy
Over your cup of tea
(My image unlimited)
Oh, that's how my story goes
But you already know
I'm stuck in your head
(My image unlimited)
Oh, you must like what you see
I make it look easy
Over your cup of tea
(My image unlimited)
My image
My image
My image
My image
There's always enough of me to go around
(My image unlimited)
Oh, that's how my story goes
But you already know
I'm stuck in your head
(My image unlimited)
Oh, you must like what you see
I make it look easy
Over your cup of tea
(My image unlimited)
Oh, that's how my story goes
But you already know
I'm stuck in your head
(My image unlimited)
Oh, you must like what you see
I make it look easy
Over your cup of tea
(My image unlimited)
Oh, that's how my story goes
But you already know
I'm stuck in your head
(My image unlimited)
