<song artist="Kylie_Minogue" title="Million_Miles">
Right in front of your eyes
Why can't you see me?
Can't you read all the signs?
Why can't you feel it?
Can we love just a little bit harder?
My heart's beating to this drum
It hasn't even started
But I know that it's love
'Cause I feel like I'm a million, million
Feel like I'm a million miles away
Feel like I'm a million, million
Feel like I'm a million miles away
When you touch my body I go weak
But you're so hard for me to reach
I feel like I'm a million, million
Feel like I'm a million miles away, miles away
Feels like I'm going crazy
'Cause I'm always craving your touch
My daydreams are amazing
Oh boy you're never too much
I wanna love just a little bit harder
My heart's beating to this drum
It hasn't even started
But I know that it's love
'Cause I feel like I'm a million, million
Feel like I'm a million miles away
Feel like I'm a million, million
Feel like I'm a million miles away
When you touch my body I go weak
But you're so hard for me to reach
I feel like I'm a million, million
Feel like I'm a million miles away, miles away
I feel so invisible
Why can't you see me?
You're the one that I want
It's so clear to me
I feel so invisible
I feel so invisible
I feel so, I feel so, I feel so
'Cause I feel like I'm a million, million
Feel like I'm a million miles away (million miles away)
Feel like I'm a million, million
Feel like I'm a million miles away
When you touch my body I go weak
But you're so hard for me to reach
I feel like I'm a million, million
Feel like I'm a million miles away, miles away
I feel so invisible
I feel like, million miles away
I feel so invisible
I feel like, million miles away
Right in front of your eyes
Why can't you see me?
