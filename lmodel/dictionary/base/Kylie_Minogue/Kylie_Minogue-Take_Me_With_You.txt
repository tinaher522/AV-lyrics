<song artist="Kylie_Minogue" title="Take_Me_With_You">
I try not to panic,
Can't hold on to the pieces,
It's hard to stop my heart from racing,
If I could sprint into tomorrow,
If I could reach to where I've never been,
Get to where I'm facing
I don't want to be here,
Take me with you,
Take me with you
I try to be careful,
And hold on to the reason,
It's hard to stop my head from spinning,
If I could speed up to tomorrow,
If I could see the things I've never seen,
Get to where I'm going
I don't want to be here,
Take me with you,
Take me with you,
Take me with you,
Take me with you
I don't want to hurt inside,
Feel like I'm losing time,
Take me with you
Take me with you
Take me with you
Take me with you
Take me with you
With you,
With you
