<song artist="Kylie_Minogue" title="Difficult_By_Design">
It's the heartache and the happiness
That won't let you rest
It's the pleasure and the pain that comes
When you love someone
You've spent so much time
Trying to get it right
Don't ask the reason why
It's a part of life
Our love can be difficult at times
But it is by design
Oh love is difficult at times
But it is by design
It's the laughter beyond the tears
That you need to hear
But to know that you can make it through
When a love is true
It feels like a lonely road
You don't know which way to go
How I want you to know you are not alone
Our love can be difficult at times
But it is by design
Oh love is difficult at times
But it is by design
Love is difficult but it's by design
Love is difficult but it's by design
Oooh, ooh, ooh
Love is difficult but it's by design
Love is difficult but it's by design
Oooh, ooh, ooh
