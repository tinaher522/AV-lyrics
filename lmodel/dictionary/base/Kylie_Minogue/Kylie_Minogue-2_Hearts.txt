<song artist="Kylie_Minogue" title="2_Hearts">
You make me invisible
Like the sky you make my day
I feel so wonderful
Oh oh-oh, don't let go
I'm seeing the dark of you
It feels like I never saw the sun
Should I shout for a rescue
Oh oh-oh, don't let go
Oh oh-oh, don't let go
Two hearts are beating together, I'm in love, I'm in love
Is this forever and ever, I'm in love, I'm in love
Two hearts are beating together, I'm in love, I'm in love
Is this forever and ever, I'm in love, I'm in love
Looks good in the sunshine
Hold on because I'm coming on up for air
I can't even see up here
Oh oh-oh, don't let go
Oh oh-oh, don't let go
Two hearts are beating together, I'm in love, I'm in love
Is this forever and ever, I'm in love, I'm in love
Two hearts are beating together, I'm in love, I'm in love
Is this forever and ever, I'm in love, I'm in love
(Two hearts)
I'm in love, I'm in love, is this forever and ever
I'm in love, I'm in love (two hearts)
