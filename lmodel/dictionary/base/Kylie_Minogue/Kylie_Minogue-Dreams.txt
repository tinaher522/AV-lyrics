<song artist="Kylie_Minogue" title="Dreams">
To have every man but to love only one
To wake with the moon and sleep with the sun
To be a sinner, a saint, a lover and friend
To know a beginning but never an end
To fly in the ocean and swim in the skies
Believer in truth, defendant of lies
To know the purest love, the deepest pain
To be lost and found again and again and again
These are the dreams of an impossible princess
These are the dreams of an impossible princess
To know the power of wealth and poverty
To taste every moment and try everything
To be hailed as a hero, branded a fool
Believe in the sacred and break every rule
To give into pleasure with no boundaries
Living in chaos and harmony
To feel the touch of a man, a woman's caress
To know the limits of torture and tenderness
These are the dreams of an impossible princess
These are the dreams of an impossible princess
Man and woman
Boy and girl
They want to escape this world
Man and woman
Boy and girl
They want to escape this world
(Nothing what it seems
Living in your dreams)
(These are the dreams of an impossible princess
These are the dreams of an impossible princess)
It's a way of dealing with all the feeling, keep believing in dreams
It's a way of dealing with all the feeling, keep believing in dreams
