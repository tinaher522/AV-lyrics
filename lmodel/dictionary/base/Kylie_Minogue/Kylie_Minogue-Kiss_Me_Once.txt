<song artist="Kylie_Minogue" title="Kiss_Me_Once">
We're in a war
Wrote the underscore
Do you feel me?
There's a look in your eyes
Something's up tonight
I can feel it
And the air is thick
With the scent of it
And the damn won't break
One tear falls
Tension cracks the walls
And relief comes
Me and you, baby we made it through
Me and you, we've got some loving to do
Kiss me once, and you will watch me fall
Kiss me twice, and I will give you my all
We'll push through
Like two souls should do
Do you feel me?
Come out for air, it's dark in there
Do you love me? (Do you love me?)
And the night will come
If you do not run
Stand and face the pain
One tear falls
Tension cracks the walls
And relief comes
Me and you, baby we made it through
Me and you, we've got some loving to do
Kiss me once, and you will watch me fall
Kiss me twice, and I will give you my all
Me and you, baby we made it through
Me and you, we've got some loving to do
Kiss me once, and you will watch me fall
Kiss me twice, and I will give you my all
