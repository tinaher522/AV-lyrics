What's the worst thing
That could happen to you
Take a chance tonight
And try something new
You're getting boring
You're oh so boring
And I don't recognize the zombie you've turned into
Don't worry
'Cause tonight I've got you
You can take a seat
Do what you normally do
I'm about to let you see (let you see)
This is what will happen if you ain't giving your girl what she needs
Leave you, move on to a perfect stranger
You talk, I walk, wanna feel the danger
See me with him and it's turning you on
It's got me saying, "Can't have me back at the end of the song."
Get outta my way
Get outta my way
Got no more to say
He's taking your place
Get outta my way
Way outta my way
Got no more to say
He's taking your place
Get outta my way
Now, I've got a taste
I wanna explore
Ain't going to waste
No not any more
Your going hard now
To win my heart but
Too many times now you've been coming up short
Don't worry
'Cause tonight I've got you
You can take a seat
Do what you normally do
I'm about to let you see (let you see)
This is what will happen if you ain't giving your girl what she needs
Leave you, move on to a perfect stranger
You talk, I walk, wanna feel the danger
See me with him and it's turning you on
It's got me saying, "Can't have me back at the end of the song."
Get outta my way
Get outta my way
Got no more to say
He's taking your place
Get outta my way
Way outta my way
Got no more to say
He's taking your place
Get outta my way
You know I ain't going home
'Cause I wanna stay
But I won't be alone
No how, no way
Now I'll show you what I'm made of (made of)
This is what will happen if you ain't giving your girl what she needs
Leave you, move on to a perfect stranger
You talk, I walk, wanna feel the danger
See me with him and it's turning you on
It's got me saying, "Can't have me back at the end of the song."
Get outta my way
Get outta my way
Got no more to say
He's taking you place
Get outta my way
Way outta my way
Got no more to say
He's taking your place
Get outta my way
You know I ain't going home
But I won't be alone
Now I showed you what I'm made of
Now I showed you what I'm made of
