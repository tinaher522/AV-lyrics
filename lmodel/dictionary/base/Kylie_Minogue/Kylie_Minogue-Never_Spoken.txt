<song artist="Kylie_Minogue" title="Never_Spoken">
I know I've said too much confessing to my love
I was caught up in the moment
Should have tried to keep my cool
But I tried to bend the rules
In any case you would have known it
By the way that I've been looking at you
You can tell that I am gone, gone, gone
Sometimes I wish, I'd never spoken
Honesty can be too open
It's not what I was hoping for
I didn't mean to open up that door
I wish, I'd never spoken
It was going oh so well, still could be I can't tell
Now I don't know what you're thinking
Those three little words were they ready to be heard
Should my heart fly or be sinking
Well, I've said it now my feelings out loud
But I don't want you to be gone, gone, gone
Sometimes I wish, I'd never spoken
Honesty can be too open
It's not what I was hoping for
I didn't mean to open up that door
I wish I'd never spoken
How long do you wait to say I love you?
How long do I look in your eyes?
How long does it take to say I love you?
When's the right time?
Sometimes I wish, I'd never spoken
Honesty can be too open
It's not what I was hoping for
I didn't mean to open up that door
I wish, I'd never spoken
Sometimes I wish, I'd never spoken
Honesty can be too open
It's not what I was hoping for
I didn't mean to open up that door
I wish, I'd never spoken
Sometimes I wish, I'd never spoken
Honesty can be too open
It's not what I was hoping for
I didn't mean to open up that door
I wish, I'd never spoken
