<song artist="Kylie_Minogue" title="Fever">
I've been bitten by the bug and I am coming down with oh
Something that can't be cured
There ain't a doctor in this town who is more qualified then you
Yeah to be so adored
So tell me what do you prescribe for these symptoms
A heart beating faster and work is a disaster
I'm lovesick when you're not around
Check me over
When strong hands are healing
I'm dancing on the ceiling
Fever sure has got me good
Whatcha do when fever takes hold
I can't help but need this drug
Don't you feel the fever like I do?
Feel the fever
I am ready for the news so tell me straight
Hey doctor just what do you diagnose
There ain't a surgeon like you any place in all the world
So now shall I remove my clothes?
So tell me what do you advise for these symptoms
A heart beating faster and work is a disaster
I'm lovesick when you're not around
Check me over
When strong hands are healing
I'm dancing on the ceiling
Fever sure has got me good
Whatcha do when fever takes hold
I can't help but need this drug
Don't you feel the fever like I do?
Fever sure has got me good
Whatcha do when fever takes hold
I can't help but need this drug
Don't you feel the fever like I do?
Tell me what do you prescribe for these symptoms
A heart beating faster and work is a disaster
I'm lovesick when you're not around
Check me over
When strong hands are healing
I'm dancing on the ceiling
Fever sure has got me good
Whatcha do when fever takes hold
I can't help but need this drug
Don't you feel the fever like I do?
Feel the fever
