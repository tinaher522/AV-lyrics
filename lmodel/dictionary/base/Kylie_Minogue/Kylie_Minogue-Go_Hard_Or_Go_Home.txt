Hmmmm
I feel my heart stuck to beat like a drum
Every, everytime you're looking my way
I see them other guys, trying but I only
Wanna, wanna hear what you have to say
Don't keep me waiting, got one chance before
I'm off to sit elsewhere, that window is closed
I keep my (oh, oh oh, oh, oh oh)
Boy don't you know that I'm the hottest in here?
(Keep it going now) (oh, oh oh, oh, oh oh)
Get in gear before I disappear with my girls.
I said you gotta go hard or go home,
Cause if you get a girl like me all alone
You better take advantage of the moment
Boy, you better own it,
And you gotta go hard or go home
I work my eyes, show my curves, flash a smile
So you know you can invade my space
I'm standing by, wasting time, time to fly
Do you do you like the thrill of the chase?
Don't keep me waiting, got one chance before
I'm off to saint elsewhere, that window is closed
I keep my (oh, oh oh, oh, oh oh)
Boy don't you know that I'm the hottest in here?
(Keep it going now) (oh, oh oh, oh, oh oh)
Get in gear before I disappear with my girls.
I said you gotta go hard or go home
Cause if you get a girl like me all alone
You better take advantage of the moment
I said you gotta go hard or go home,
'Cause if you get a girl like me all alone
You better take advantage of the moment
Boy, you better own it
And you gotta go hard or go home
Close the deal right now or
I'll be outta the door
If you want me
Come get body to body
I won't say it no more
Ta ra na na na
Ta ra na na na
Ta na na na na na na
Ta ra na na na
Ta ra na na na
Get in gear before I disappear with my girls
I said you gotta go hard or go home
'Cause if you get a girl like me all alone
You better take advantage of the moment
Boy, you better own it
And you gotta go hard or go home
I said you gotta go hard or go home
'Cause if you get a girl like me all alone
You better take advantage of the moment
Boy, you better own it
And you gotta go hard or go home
Ta ra na na na
Ta ra na na na
Boy don't you know that I'm the hottest in here?
Ta ra na na na
Ta ra na na na
Ta ra na na na
Get in gear before I disappear with my girls
