<song artist="Kylie_Minogue" title="You're_The_One">
If you believe in me
And all it can be
Then we're halfway there
Where would I be without you
And all we've been through
And this love we've shared 
If we were ever to start
To let love fall apart
I'd lose my way
There are just three words
I need to be heard
I only want to say
You're the one
In the quietness
Is where I confess
How I feel inside
When you're holding me
Everything I need
Is by my side
Take me away to a place
A time and a space
That makes me feel pure

I will be here for you
I adore you
Of this I am sure
You're the one
Now that I have bared my soul for you
A little trust wouldn't go astray
Now that I would give it all to you
Don't let a mishap get in the way
Cause its a long way down from where you're sitting
At the top on a jewelled throne
And I've dealt with a demon once or twice
And they were left to pay the price alone
If we were ever to start
Drifting apart
Then I'd lose my way
Can you turn to me
In all honesty
I need it when you say
You're the one
