<song artist="Kylie_Minogue" title="The_Reflex">
Ben Lee: You've gone too far this time 
Both: But I'm dancing on the Valentine 
Ben Lee: I tell you somebody's fooling around 
Both: With my chances on the dangerline 
Both: I cross that bridge when I find it 
Another day to make my stand, oh 
High time is no time for deciding 
If I should find a helping hand, oh 
Both: So why don't you use it 
Try not to bruise it 
Buy time don't lose it 
Both: The reflex is an only child 
He's waiting in the park 
The reflex is a jaw-defining 
Treasure in the dark 
Kylie Minogue: I'm getting off this ride 
Both: But they won't slow down on the roundabout 
Kylie Minogue: I sold the Renoir and the TV set 
Both: Don't wanna be around when this gets out
Both: So why don't you use it
Try not to bruise it 

Buy time don't lose it 
Both: The reflex is an only child 
He's waiting in the park 
The reflex is a jaw-defining 
Treasure in the dark
Both: Watching over lucky clover
Isn't that bizarre
Every little thing the reflex does 
Leaves your answer with a question mark 
Both: The reflex is an only child
He's waiting in the park 
The reflex is a jaw-defining 
Treasure in the dark 
Both: Watching over lucky clover 
Isn't that bizarre 
Every little thing the reflex does 
Leaves your answer with a question mark 
Both: The reflex, what a game 
He's hiding all the cards 
The reflex is a jaw-defining 
Treasure in the dark
