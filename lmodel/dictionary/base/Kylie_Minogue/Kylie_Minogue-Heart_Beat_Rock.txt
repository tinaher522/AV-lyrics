<song artist="Kylie_Minogue" title="Heart_Beat_Rock">
Lovers in the backseat
Boys in the backstreets
Girls in their tight washed
Figure hugging blue jeans
They're looking like they want
To show out what they got
Their feet are itching to dance
Their body's ready to rock
Now I've been around the world
But I'm not those other girls
I'm feeling special do you like what you see?
'Cause I got my best dress on
Can I be your fantasy?
'Cause I can make your heart beat rock
I can make your heart beat rock
I can make your heart beat rock
I can make your heart beat rock
I can make your heart beat rock (ooh, ooh)
Baby show me what you got
Baby show me what you got
I can make you so damn hot
I can make you so damn hot
'Cos I can make your heart beat
(Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah)
(Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah)
Ladies in the spot light
Boys are checking their tight
Skirts out while their hips sway
Bumping to the hot track
People take a step back
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
'Cause I can make your heart beat rock
I can make your heart beat rock
I can make your heart beat rock
I can make your heart beat rock
I can make your heart beat rock (ooh, ooh)
Baby show me what you got
Baby show me what you got
I can make you so damn hot
I can make you so damn hot
'Cause I can make your heart beat
'Cause I can make your heart beat
(Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah)
Now I've been around the world
But I'm not those other girls
I'm feeling special do you like what you see?
'Cause I got my best dress on
Can I be your fantasy?
'Cause I can make your heart beat rock
I can make your heart beat rock
I can make your heart beat rock
I can make your heart beat rock
I can make your heart beat rock
Baby show me what you got
Baby show me what you got
I can make you so damn hot
I can make you so damn hot
'Cause I can make your heart beat
(Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah)
'Cause I can make your heart beat
(Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah)
'Cause I can make your heart beat
(Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah)
(Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah)
(Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah)
