<song artist="Kylie_Minogue" title="Limbo">
I see them all smiling, those all around me
They tend to my wounds and alert my senses
It would be nice, I'm not here
I'm dreaming
Holding on
Time has no meaning, all of it wasted
Smothers me till there's no more air
When will it be that I can breathe again
I'm waiting
In the void
(Limbo) lost in limbo
(Limbo) limbo, limbo
(Limbo) lost in limbo
(Limbo)
This notion of needing has held me ransom
And all I can do is avoid my mind
Don't make me speak or hear or look
Because I'm hurting
Help me out
(Limbo) lost in limbo
(Limbo) limbo, limbo
(Limbo) lost in limbo
(Limbo) I'm in limbo
Limbo, limbo....
I'm getting tired
I'm getting tired, tired...
Caught in a crossfire, nobody gets it
I'm finding it hard to contain myself
Take all my trust and faith and hope
Until I need it
Once again
(Limbo) lost in limbo
(Limbo) limbo, limbo
(Limbo) lost in limbo
(Limbo) limbo, limbo
(Limbo) lost in limbo
(Limbo) limbo, limbo
(Limbo) I'm lost in limbo
(Limbo) I'm in limbo
Limbo
