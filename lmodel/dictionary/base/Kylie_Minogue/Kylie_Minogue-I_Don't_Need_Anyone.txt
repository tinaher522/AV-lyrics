<song artist="Kylie_Minogue" title="I_Don't_Need_Anyone">
I feel like speed
I feel like liquid
I give into you
I melt into you
I felt like nothing
Was said and done
I fall into you
I fall into you
I don't need anyone
Except for someone that I don't know
I don't need anyone
Except for someone I've not found
I don't need anyone
Except for someone that I don't know
I don't need anyone
Except for someone I've not found
Your signiture
Is on my hip
A kiss from you
Still on my lip
I am entire
I am finally one
But the the moment
Is long gone
I don't need anyone
Except for someone that I don't know
I don't need anyone
Except for someone I've not found
I don't need anyone
Except for someone that I don't know
I don't need anyone
Except for someone I've not found
