<song artist="Kylie_Minogue" title="Cover_Me_With_Kisses">
Jump back, tell a friend
Ooh la la la
Ooh la la la
Ooh la la la
I want a movie moment
We're so in love it hurts
Wanna be the main attraction
Everybody's favourite girl
Wanna be in Gucci dresses
I know you like that style
Symphony of stars to serenade us
I'm giving you my smile
Cover me with kisses
Sweet, sweet kisses
Come on over and kiss me all over
I'm gonna be here
So cover me
Run into you in slow motion
Thunderclaps and pouring rain
The world is falling down around us
We didn't notice anyway
Wanna be in Gucci dresses
I know you like that style
Symphony of stars to serenade us
A billion watt smile
So cover me with kisses
Sweet, sweet kisses
Come on over and kiss me all over
I'm gonna be here
So cover me with kisses
Sweet, sweet kisses
Come on over and kiss me all over
My love is for real
Come on, come on, cover me, baby
Come on, come on, cover me, baby
Come on, come on, cover me, baby
Come on, come on, cover me, baby
Come on, come on, cover me, baby
Come on, come on, cover me, baby
Come on, come on, cover me, baby
Come on, come on, cover me, baby
Cover me with kisses
Sweet, sweet kisses
Come on over and kiss me all over
I'm gonna be here
So cover me with kisses
Sweet, sweet kisses
Come on over and kiss me all over
My love is for real
So cover me
