<song artist="Kylie_Minogue" title="Excuse_My_French">
Ooh ooh ooh....
So slow (so slow)
And I can barely feel you move me
You'll never let me just let go (just let go)
When all I wanna do is ooohh... excuse my french
It's giving and taking
This feeling's so frustrating
And I'm longing to touch you
But you just keep me waiting
Baby, look into my eyes
It's time you realise
All I've been missing
Is another french kissing
Encore, encore
I can hear you breathing
Baby, seeing is believing
Give me more, more
Ooh ooh ooh...
I'll show (I'll shooooow)
That I'm a woman who's not faking
I'll never let you lose control (never let you lose control)
'Cause all I wanna do is ooohh... excuse my french
It's giving and taking
This feeling's so frustrating
And I'm longing to touch you
But you just keep me waiting
Baby, look into my eyes (baby, look into my eyes)
It's time you realise
All I've been missing
Is another french kissing
Encore, encore
I can hear you breathing
Baby seeing is believing
Give me more, more
All I've been missing
Is another french kissing
Encore, encore
I can hear you breathing
Baby seeing is believing
Give me more, more
Dare you deny me
Just satisfy me
Give it all away 
Show me that you want me
Dare you deny me
Just satisfy me
Give it all away 
Show me that you want me
(Breathing, kissing...)
All I've been missing
Is another french kissing
Kissing, kissing, kissing...
All I've been missing
Is another french kissing
Kissing, kissing, kissing...
All I've been missing
Is another french kissing
Encore, encore
I can hear you breathing
Baby, seeing is believing
Give me more, more
All I've been missing
Is another french kissing
Encore, encore
I can hear you breathing
Baby, seeing is believing
Give me more, more
Ooh ooh ooh....
