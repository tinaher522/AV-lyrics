(Oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh)
Weekend has arrived
Everybody's trying to find
Something to get into
My friends wanna go out
But I can't cancel my plans
I got a date with my baby
He's taking me out
So I gotta catch up with you
Some other day
Gotta go
Can't make him wait
Tonight
I have to make sure I'm looking hot
'Cause we're going to our favourite spot
Till the morning we're gonna rock
Boy you knock me out, yeah
My baby
Doesn't matter what's going on
Or who's around us
All I see is you
Right now they're playing our song
Dance floor is ours
All I see is you
The DJ's got me feeling like I did
When I first met you
And there's nothing that can break us apart
In two
'Cause all I see is you
I get lost in time
When I'm looking in your eyes
And we're body to body
I don't want you to rush
'Cause your feeling like heaven to me
Follow the rhythm
And keep it real close
In the dark everything goes
Nothing better then your touch,
Don't stop
Baby 'cause we've just begun
Tonight
I have to make sure I'm looking hot
'Cause we're going to our favourite spot
Till the morning we're gonna rock
Boy you knock me out, yeah
My baby doesn't matter what's going on
Or who's around us
All I see is you
Right now they're playing our song
Dance floor is ours
All I see is you
The DJ's got me feeling like I did
When I first met you
And there's nothing that can break us apart
In two
'Cause all I see is you
Ohh, ohh, ohh
Please don't let me go-o-o
My love for you is growing more and more and more
As we move across the floor
'Cause all I see is you
'Cause all I see is you
DJ spin my record again
My baby doesn't matter what's going on
Or who's around us
All I see is you
Right now they're playing our song
Dance floor is ours
All I see is you
The DJ's got me feeling like I did
When I first met you
And there's nothing that can break us apart
In two
'Cause all I see is you
My baby doesn't matter what's going on
Or who's around us
All I see is you
Right now they're playing our song
Dance floor is ours
All I see is you
The DJ's got me feeling like I did
When I first met you
And there's nothing that can break us apart
In two
'Cause all I see is you
