<song artist="Kylie_Minogue" title="I'm_So_High">
Will you take me pool side
To feel the summer breeze
There's a place that looks inviting
By the frangipani tree
A little taste of moonlight
And a canopy of stars
Ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooh
It's a feeling
Such a feeling
Something I can not hide
You're the reason
I'm so high
Ever had the feeling
So could it be more right
I feel as if I know you
But we only met tonight
I've got a cool sensation
I can hardly catch my breath
Ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooh
It's a feeling
Such a feeling
Something I can not hide
You're the reason
I'm so high
Ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo oh
It's a feeling
Such a feeling
Something I can not hide
On the ceiling
I'm so high
In the evening
I'm so high
Such a feeling
I'm so high
The party's almost over
I don't want tonight to end
We could be starting something
You feel more than a friend
The universe conspired
For the two of us tonight
Ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooh
It's a feeling
Such a feeling
Something I can not hide
You're the reason
I'm so high
Ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooh
It's a feeling
Such a feeling
Something I can not hide
You're the reason
I'm so high
On the ceiling
I'm so high
In the evening
I'm so high
Such a feeling
I'm so high
