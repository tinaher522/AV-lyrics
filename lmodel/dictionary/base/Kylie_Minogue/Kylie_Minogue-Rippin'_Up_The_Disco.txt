<song artist="Kylie_Minogue" title="Rippin'_Up_The_Disco">
Down, down, down, down...
Micro love, you're shattered dreams and glitter
The shuffle, shaking shiver
To mourn electro lady luck
Metallically reflecting your retromatic fashion and style
I never want to lose the glow
Strobe lightning take over my soul
Intrusion never let you go
You won't control me now
I'm burning to feel it
Now I'm
Ripping up the disco
Raving on the dancefloor
Ripping up the disco
Raving on the dancefloor
Baby, if you think you're in me
Won't control me now
Ripping up the disco (won't control me now)
Raving on the dancefloor
Ripping up the disco
Raving on the dancefloor
Down, down, down, down...
Destiny, I'm hip to your persuasion
Your solid reputation
I follow who's at the red light road
You're slammin' and you relish
So foxy funkadellic, you glow
Lights mantra I begin to move
Reaction spotlight on the groove
Suspicious, everybody wants to play
You won't control me now
I'm burning to feel it
Now I'm
Ripping up the disco
Raving on the dancefloor
Ripping up the disco
Raving on the dancefloor
Baby, if you think you're in me
Won't control me now
Ripping up the disco (won't control me now)
Raving on the dancefloor
Ripping up the disco
Raving on the dancefloor
Ripping up the disco
Raving on the dancefloor
Ripping up the disco
Raving on the dancefloor
Ripping up the disco
Raving on the dancefloor
Ripping up the disco
Raving on the dancefloor
You won't control me now
I'm burning to feel it
Now I'm
Ripping up the disco
Raving on the dancefloor
Ripping up the disco
Raving on the dancefloor
Ripping up the disco
Raving on the dancefloor
