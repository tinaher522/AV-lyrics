<song artist="Kylie_Minogue" title="Voodoo">
Boy don't run and hide, I can bring you back to life
I've got something you ain't never seen
So let me cast my spell, you know why I made black belt
Baby I can give you what you need
I'ma take you to another realm
Show you how we do it, do it in the spirit world
Now look me in the eyes, I find the black magic in you
I let you lay me down, I let you work on your voodoo
And in the black of night, you feel the spirits rise in you
I let you lay me down, I let you work on your voodoo
So come on touch me now, you know
I'm burning with desire
The boys are scared of me
But you're a man and you're all mine
So look me in the eyes, I find the black magic in you
I let you lay me down, I let you work on your voodoo
Work on your voodoo
Work on your voodoo
Work on your voodoo
You'll enjoy the ride, as days turn into night
You'll become a part of me
So boy don't run and hide
Give yourself to me and I'll make sure
You enjoy this witchery
I'ma take you to another realm
Show you how we do it, do it in the spirit world
Now look me in the eyes, I find the black magic in you
I let you lay me down, I let you work on your voodoo
And in the black of night, you feel the spirits rise in you
I let you lay me down, I let you work on your voodoo
So come on touch me now, you know
I'm burning with desire
The boys are scared of me
But you're a man and you're all mine
So look me in the eyes, I find the black magic in you
I let you lay me down, I let you work on your voodoo
Work on your voodoo
Work on your voodoo
Work on your voodoo
Work on your voodoo
Work on your voodoo
Work on your voodoo
Now look me in the eyes, I find the black magic in you
I let you lay me down, I let you work on your voodoo
And in the black of night, you feel the spirits rise in you
I let you lay me down, I let you work on your voodoo
So come on touch me now, you know I'm burning with desire
The boys are scared of me
but you're a man and you're all mine
So look me in the eyes, I find the black magic in you
I let you lay me down, I let you work on your voodoo
Work on your voodoo
Work on your voodoo
Work on your voodoo
