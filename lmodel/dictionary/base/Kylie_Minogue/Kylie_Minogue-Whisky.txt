<song artist="Kylie_Minogue" title="Whisky">
Put some whisky in your water
Sugar in your tea
Coz there aint gonna be no possiblity with you and a me
Sonny it aint gonna funny when walk up to me
And you sing 
You sing the lullaby 
that lullaby that makes me cry (cry)
I'll melt away 
I'll melt away in your love
