<song artist="Kylie_Minogue" title="I_Am_Ready">
We can drown any rumours
'Bout winners and losers
Sayin' "I aint' ready for that"
When the love needs to grow
And the world wants to know
We gotta keep it under your hat
Sometimes those close to you
Find it hard to feel your pain
Sometimes you wanna surrender
But you say here I come again
I'm the survivor
Even denier
I felt compasion
Even with knives in my back
But you know it ain't over
When you feel the tears dry
You can laugh at the clouds in the sky and it don't seem so black
Oh, I belive in the love that your givin and I'm ready for that, yeah
I'm the survivor
I felt compasion
I'm the survivor
You can laugh at the clouds in the sky ain't it don't seem so bad
Feelings gone and fast
Then its suddenly back
You were over and now your a queen
You forget who you are
For they made you a star
And now your hotter than you ever been
Sometimes those close to you
Find it hard to feel your pain
Sometimes you wanna surrender
But you say here I come again
I'm the survivor
Even denier
I felt compasion
Even with knives in my back
But you know it ain't over
When you feel the tears dry
You can laugh at the clouds in the sky and it don't seem so black
Oh, I belive in the love that your givin and I'm ready for that, yeah
I'm the survivor
Even denier
