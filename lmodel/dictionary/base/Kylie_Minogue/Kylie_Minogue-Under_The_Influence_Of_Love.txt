<song artist="Kylie_Minogue" title="Under_The_Influence_Of_Love">
Walking on a cloud, feeling high
It happens every time, whenever I am with my guy
Tripping on love and it feels so good
I can't help myself and I wouldn't if I could
But he's got that certain touch
That I'm addicted to
Love's really got a hold on me
And there's nothing that I can do
Oh I, I'm under the influence of love
And I know there ain't no doubt about it
Oh I, I'm under the influence of love
And I know I just can't live without it
Need another dose, can't get enough
I've just got to have all of my baby's love
And when I'm alone feeling sad and blue
He gives me a shot of love and I'm as good as new
Helpless as I am and still I don't care
His tenderness is what I miss
Whenever he's not here
Oh I, I'm under the influence of love
And I know there ain't no doubt about it
Oh I, I'm under the influence of love
And I know I just can't live without it
There just ain't no one else
Who can bring out the love in me
So many guys I've tried
They've tried to get to my eyes
But he's the only one I see
Oh I, I'm under the influence of love
And I know there ain't no doubt about it
Oh I, I'm under the influence of love
And I know I just can't live without it
