Just loose yourself
Give into the music, oh you can do it (yeah yeah)
And free your mind
Don't think about it, now were running, dancing
Wanna appoligise
Baby I know, what I want tonight
I'm on a super highway baby better give way
(yeah yeah ohhhh)
Chorus:
Don't wanna turn it down
I'm hungry for your sound
I wanna loose myself (oh I like your rhythm)
And I cant help myself
For me theres no one else
I wanna loose myself in your beats per minute!
(woow woow your beats per minute)
(woow woow your beats per minute)
(woow woow your beats per minute)

Oh it feels like heaven (baby)
Through the night
Keep it flowing, its cool and you know it yeah yeah
Can't run or hide
Baby I know, what I feel inside
A facinating rhythm devine
(yeah yeah ohhhh)
Don't wanna turn it down
I'm hungry for your sound
I wanna loose myself (oh I like your rhythm)
And I cant help myself
For me theres no one else
I wanna loose myself in your beats per minute!
