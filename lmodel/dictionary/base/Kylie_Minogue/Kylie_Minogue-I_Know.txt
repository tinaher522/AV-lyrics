<song artist="Kylie_Minogue" title="I_Know">
I feel the rush, rush 
Are we coming to the edge of a waterfall?
Is it your touch, touch?
I can see it in your eyes that you want it all
Can I give you everything that you'll ever need?
Ooh forever starts right now
Like a wind at a sail driving on a sea
Only you can show me how
You can tell me now
That I'll never come down
I know, I know
You can show me light
When we sleep at night
I know, I know
This river runs deep
And the moon glides by
And the mountains lay wet with snow
And your love comes back like a faithful tide
Teaching everything I know
Woh-ooh woh-ooh-oh-oh 
Woh-ooh woh-ooh-oh-oh 
Woh-ooh woh-ooh-oh-oh 
Woh-ooh woh-ooh-oh-oh 
Is it too much, much?
'Cause it's written in the skies who we really are
Am I in love, love?
Deeper is the dark brighter shining stars
Can we be everything that we wanna be?
Ooh never let this die
Feel the wave of your kiss washing over me
Only you can get me high
You can tell me now
That I'll never come down
I know, I know
You can show me light
When we sleep at night
I know, I know
This river runs deep
And the moon glides by
And the mountains lay wet with snow
And your love comes back like a faithful tide
Teaching everything I know
Woh-ooh woh-ooh-oh-oh
Woh-ooh woh-ooh-oh-oh
Woh-ooh woh-ooh-oh-oh
Woh-ooh woh-ooh-oh-oh
Do-do-do-do 
Do-do-do-do 
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do...
