Hmm....hmm...
I'll dive deep, I have fallen all the way 
Happily there's no escape, surrender to your heart 
Giving in to all of this, fascinated by your kiss
I'm floating in your arms
Take your time, just unwind 
Ooh, I wanna breathe you in 
A little while to ease your mind 
You're the world I'm living in
Precious time with you 
Diving in the blue 
We are riding on the waves 
These are loving days, loving days with you 
Fantasy, feel it rushing over me 
Nowhere else I want to be, my love is by my side (by my side)
For a moment you and me, holding on to ecstacy 
Give us all day and night (oh)
Take your time, just unwind
Ooh, I wanna breathe you in
A little while to ease your mind
You're the world I'm living in
Precious time with you 
Diving in the blue
We are riding on the waves 
These are loving days, loving days with you
(These are loving days)
Precious time with you
(This is precious time with you)
Diving in the blue
(We are diving in the blue)
We are riding on the waves
These are loving days, loving days...with you
Oh...hey...oh, oh....whoo....hey...
These are loving days....with you
Precious time with you
Diving in the blue 
We are riding on the waves
These are loving days, loving days with you 
(These are loving....days)
Precious time with you (ooh)
Diving in the blue
We are riding on the waves
These are loving days, loving days with you...
