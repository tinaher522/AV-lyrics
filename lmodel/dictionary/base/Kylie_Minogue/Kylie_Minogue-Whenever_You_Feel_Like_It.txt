<song artist="Kylie_Minogue" title="Whenever_You_Feel_Like_It">
I can't catch my breath
Whenever you feel like it...
Where ever you feel like it...
How ever you feel like it... I like it
You're wild, you're crazy
You're not like other people baby
You're a devil, you're a rebel
Thats why I need you baby
Your keeping my up all night
Your making me feel alright
You march to the beat of your own drum baby
You can come to me
Whenever you feel like it...
Where ever you feel like it...
How ever you feel like it... I like it
You're dark, you're stormy
You really do it for me
I'm here, I'm waiting
Use your imagination
You're keeping my up all night
You're making me feel alright
You march to the beat of your own drum baby
You can come to me
Whenever you feel like it...
Where ever you feel like it...
How ever you feel like it... I like it
Your hearts beating with the rhythm of love
Dont stop now i cant get enough
My hearts beating me to death
I can't catch my breath
You're keeping my up all night
You're making me feel alright
You march to the beat of your own drum yeah
Come on, come on, come on
Whenever you feel like it...
Where ever you feel like it...
How ever you feel like it... I like it
You can hold me there
You can call on me
You'll be fine with me
Whenever you feel like it...
Where ever you feel like it...
How ever you feel like it... I like it
