<song artist="Kylie_Minogue" title="Better_Than_Today">
Oh, I see what she do
But I can do it better
And the talk of the town be true
That I'll make you forget her
How can you hate something that you ain't have tried?
You've got to lose control most every night
Yeah you've seen what they do?
Well, we can do it better, yeah, I'm talking to you
You've got to...
Feel it
See it
Know how much you need it
What's the point of livin' if you don't take a chance?
You've got to...
Use it
Lose it
Know that you'll still do it
What's the point of livin' if you don't wanna dance?
Oh, I know life is hard
So we'll live it for the weekend
You can hurt, or take heart
I guess it really depends
What's the point of worryin' about being cool?
When there's a million things to learn they never teach you in school?
I don't believe what they say
We just want tomorrow to be better than today
You've got to...
Feel it
See it
Know how much you need it
What's the point of livin' if you don't take a chance?
You've got to...
Use it
Lose it
Know that you'll still do it
What's the point of livin' if you don't wanna dance?
You've got to...
Feel it
See it
Know how much you need it
What's the point of livin' if you don't take a chance?
You've got to...
Use it
Lose it
Know that you'll still do it
What's the point of livin' if you don't wanna dance?
Fabrications complicate the world in a web
Too much useless information plays with your head
Very clever people know we all need a chance
To stop our clever busyness and let go and dance
You've got to...
Use it
Lose it
Know that you'll still do it
What's the point of livin' if you don't wanna dance?
You've got to...
Feel it
See it
Know how much you need it
What's the point of livin' if you don't take a chance?
You've got to...
Use it
Lose it
Know that you'll still do it
What's the point of livin' if you don't wanna dance?
Oh-oh, oh-oh everybody 
Everybody wanna dance now
Oh-oh, oh-oh everybody
Everybody wanna dance now
