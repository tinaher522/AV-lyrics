<song artist="Kylie_Minogue" title="Cowboy_Style">
Shed my skin since you came in;
Where do you end and I begin?
Awoke my senses, yet you stopped time;
You took me to a deeper high...
The essence of my hopes and fears;
Creation of my muddled dreams...
Cowboy style with a peaceful smile,
You are from the temple, won't you stay awhile?
Found my voice, to have my say;
You take me close to far away...
And now I find, and now I feel,
The ordinary is surreal...
Peace and terror all in one;
My future life has just begun...
Cowboy style with a peaceful smile,
You are from the temple, won't you stay awhile?
Cowboy style with a peaceful smile,
You are from the temple, won't you stay awhile?
(Won't you stay awhile?)
I am frightened, I'm aroused;
I'm enlightened to the now...
Yeah, yeah, yeah...
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Yeah, yeah, yeah...
Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay...
Yeah, yeah, yeah...
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Yeah, yeah, yeah...
Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay...
Cowboy style... (Yeah, yeah, yeah...)
Cowboy style... (Yeah, yeah, yeah!)
Cowboy style with a peaceful smile,
You are from the temple, won't you stay awhile?
