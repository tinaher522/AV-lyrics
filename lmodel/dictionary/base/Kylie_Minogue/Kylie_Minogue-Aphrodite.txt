<song artist="Kylie_Minogue" title="Aphrodite">
Can you feel me in stereo
Can you feel me in stereo
Can you feel me in stereo
Can you feel me in stereo
This song lets you in
Gonna get back down and up again
I got you on my side
It's just a roller-ride
It's the truth, it's a fact
I was gone and now I'm back
Yeah
Can you feel me in stereo
Can you feel me in stereo
I've got soul, you can check
In my heart, in my head
I've got spirit you can feel
Did you think I wasn't real
I'm going back and forth, and forth and back
Can you feel me in stereo
Can you feel me in stereo
Oh I'm fierce and I'm feeling mighty
I'm a golden girl, I'm an aphrodite
Alright, alright, yeah, yeah-eah
I'm fierce and I'm feeling mighty
Don't you mess with me, you don't wanna fight me
Alright, alright, yeah, yeah-eah
Here's what I do
When I know what I can do
I let you into my world
With mouth to mouth and kiss to kiss and oh-oh
Can you feel me in stereo
Can you feel me in stereo
You sure you can take me in
'Cause this is where the fun begins?
I'm gonna feel your heart stop in my hands
I'm going back and forth, and forth and back
Can you feel me in stereo
Can you feel me in stereo
Oh I'm fierce and I'm feeling mighty
I'm a golden girl, I'm an aphrodite
Alright, alright, yeah, yeah-eah
I'm fierce and I'm feeling mighty
Don't you mess with me, you don't wanna fight me
Alright, alright, yeah, yeah-eah
You know that I'm magical and I am the original
I am the only one to make you feel this way
The moment that you kiss me
You know that you'll miss me
I am the only one
Can you feel me in stereo
Can you feel me in stereo
Oh, can you feel, mmm
Can you feel me in stereo, oh
Can you feel me in stereo, oh
I'm fierce and I'm feeling mighty
I'm a golden girl, I'm an aphrodite
Alright
Alright
Oh I'm fierce and I'm feeling mighty
I'm a golden girl, I'm an aphrodite
Alright, alright, yeah, yeah-eah
You know that I'm magical and I am the original
I am the only one to make you feel this way
The moment that you kiss me
You know that you'll miss me
I am the only one
