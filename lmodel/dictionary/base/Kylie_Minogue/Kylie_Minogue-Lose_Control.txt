<song artist="Kylie_Minogue" title="Lose_Control">
Round like a circle
Caught up in a spiral
You make me feel like a wheel
I'm running off the cable
But the cable seems so far now
And the wheel is turning faster
And I know I'll get there somehow
'Cause I feel like I'm gonna
You make me lose control (control)
You make me lose control (control)
You make me lose control (control)
You make me lose control (control)
Twisting, turning
I have lost my soul
'Cause now I'm yearning
I just want it all
Someone's calling
I have lost control
And the tide is turning
I just want it all, want it all
So infective
The pills that I'm taking
But nothings gonna stop me
'Cause I want it so much, so much, so much
You make me lose control (control)
You make me lose control (control)
You make me lose control (control)
You make me lose control (control)
Lose control (control)
You make me lose control (control)
You make me lose control (control)
You make me lose control (control)
Twisting, turning
I have lost my soul
'Cause now I'm yearning
I just want it all
Someone's calling
I have lost control
And the tide is turning
I just want it all, want it all
Twisting, turning
I have lost my soul
'Cause now I'm yearning
I just want it all
Twisting, turning
I have lost my soul
'Cause now I'm yearning
I just want it all, want it all
