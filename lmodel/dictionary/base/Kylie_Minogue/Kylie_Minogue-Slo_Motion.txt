<song artist="Kylie_Minogue" title="Slo_Motion">
Sink into serenity
Speak in lovers' tongue
Give into delicious dreams
The future has begun
Dare to drown in pleasures found
I'm just surrendering
Cause I don't wanna miss a thing
I'm living in slo' motion
Wish I could freeze this place in time
Everything's wide open
Now that you're here
It's unspoken
It's only the way your hand fits mine
skin on my skin
I think it's love I'm fallen into
Savouring the pure desire
The passion's come undone
with every kiss the colours change
bleeding into one
in Days gone by I'd be been wonderin'
Is this feelings gonna last?
I don't even have to ask
I'm living in slo' motion
Wish I could freeze this place in time
Everything's wide open
Now that you're here
It's unspoken
It's only the way your hand fits mine
skin on my skin
I think it's love I'm fallen into
No I don't wanna miss a thing
I'm living in slo' motion
Wish I could freeze this place in time
Everything's wide open
Now that you're here
It's unspoken
It's only the way your hand fits mine
skin on my skin
I think it's love I'm fallen into
