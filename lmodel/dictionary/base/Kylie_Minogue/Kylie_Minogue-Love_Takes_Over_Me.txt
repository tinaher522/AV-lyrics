<song artist="Kylie_Minogue" title="Love_Takes_Over_Me">
I am lost in the world of you,
can't believe where you take me to,
as soon as you enter my mind,
or you crawl over my skin,
leave me no other choice but to let you in
Love takes over me (I can feel it),
'coz, your love takes over me (I can see it),
oh, your love takes over me (I can taste it),
yeah, your love takes over me (I can be it)
Take, take me now,
I can't take no more,
feel me breathe,
feel the energy,
how did I fall prey to this,
pleasure is my lonely guide,
yeah I escaped despite of you,
now that your inside
Love takes over me (I can feel it),
when your love takes over me (I can see it),
your love takes over me (I can taste it),
yeah, your love takes over me (I can be it)
Magic is running through my veins,
Pleasure is coming closer then
So, hurt with me now,
so I won't hurt no more,
hear me scream,
hear my suffering
When your love takes over me (I can feel it),
your love takes over me (I can see it),
love takes over me (I can taste it),
love takes over me (I can be it)
(I can feel it),
love takes over me (I can see it),
your love takes over me (I can taste it),
love takes over me (I can be it)
