<song artist="Kylie_Minogue" title="Butterfly">
In the morning I'll wake up with you
There's not anything I would rather do
You are more than you'll ever know
And your love teaches me to grow
You are more than my everything
And your love gives me wings
Like a butterfly
Like a butterfly
Your touch is the one thing I know is true
My mind is completely devoted to you
You are more than you'll ever know
And your love teaches me to grow
You are more than my everything
And your love gives me wings
Like a butterfly
(And I'll dance in the sunlight)
Like a butterfly
(From the day into the night)
Like a butterfly
(And I'll dance in the sunlight)
Like a butterfly
And it might not last more than a day
But I'll take my chances anyway
'Cause my heart is saying it's for real
No one else has made me feel
Like a butterfly
Like a butterfly
Like a butterfly
And it might not last more than a day
But I'll take my chances anyway
'Cause my heart is saying it's for real
No one else has made me feel this way
And it might not last more than a day
But I'll take my chances anyway
'Cause my heart is saying it's for real
No one else has made me feel this way
(And it might not last more than a day
But I'll take my chances anyway)
Like a butterfly
('Cause my heart is saying it's for real
No one else has made me feel this way)
Like a butterfly
(And I'll dance in the sunlight)
Like a butterfly
(From the day into the night)
Like a butterfly
(And I'll dance in the sunlight)
Like a butterfly
(From the day into the night)
