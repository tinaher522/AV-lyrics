<song artist="Kylie_Minogue" title="Do_It_Again">
Can you all see this
The flowers bloomin'
Or am I trapped in a haze
And maybe it's just me
I know I'm foolish
Here I go falling again
'Cause I can't help myself
I just can't wait
It's like the rhythm of it
Keeps me awake
And who cares if it breaks
Down to heartache I'm ready to fall
I get a feelin'
It's like a shiver
I feel the butterflies
Inside I can't let go
I'd do it again
I'd do it again
It's an explosion
I keep on dancin'
I feel it takin' over me
And then I know
I'd do it again
I'd do it again
Can't help but wonder
I'm in my own world
And it's a beautiful place
I know that I've cried
My share of teardrops
See the sore lines on my face
'Cause I can't help myself
I just can't wait
Must be an energy
I just can't replace
And who cares if it breaks
Down to heartache I'm ready to fall
I get a feelin'
It's like a shiver
I feel the butterflies
Inside I can't let go
I'd do it again
I'd do it again
It's an explosion
I keep on dancin'
I feel it takin' over me
And then I know
I'd do it again
I'd do it again
I'd do it again
It's fireworks
Fantastic
It tears you apart
But it's magic
It's a first kiss
The last dance
Pulls me in every time
Oh
I get a feelin'
It's like a shiver
I feel the butterflies
Inside I can't let go
I'd do it again
I'd do it again
It's an explosion
I keep on dancin'
I feel it takin' over me
And then I know
I'd do it again
I'd do it again
