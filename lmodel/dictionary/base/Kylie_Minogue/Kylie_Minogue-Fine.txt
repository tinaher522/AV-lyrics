<song artist="Kylie_Minogue" title="Fine">
Fine
You're gonna be fine
You don't have to worry
Don't you turn and run, run, run
Turn your face into the sun, sun, sun
Standing in heaven but don't feel the light
The brightest colors are the black and white
You wanna dance but you don't trust your feet
You know the rhythm but can't feel the beat
The night, the night,
The night is full of tears you cry, you cry, you cry
When you feel everything's impossible
Just know you're gonna be
Fine
You're gonna be fine
You don't have to worry
Don't you turn and run, run, run
Turn your face into the sun, sun, sun
Fine
You're gonna be fine
It's gonna be okay a brighter day will come, come, come
Turn your face into the sun, sun, sun
Turn your face into the sun, sun, sun
Turn your face into the sun, sun, sun
You got it all but you don't feel complete
Even the sweetest things are bittersweet
You're riding high but you just feel the fall
Don't even recognize yourself at all
The night, the night
The night is full of tears you cry, you cry, you cry
Sometimes this world could leave you in the cold
But everything will be
Fine
You're gonna be fine
You don't have to worry
Don't you turn and run, run, run
Turn your face into the sun, sun, sun
Fine
You're gonna be fine
It's gonna be okay a brighter day will come, come, come
Turn your face into the sun, sun, sun
Fine
You're gonna be fine
You don't have to worry don't you turn and run, run, run
Turn your face into the sun, sun, sun
Fine
You're gonna be fine
It's gonna be okay a brighter day will come, come, come
Turn your face into the sun, sun, sun
Turn your face into the sun, sun, sun
Turn your face into the sun, sun, sun
