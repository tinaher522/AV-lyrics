<song artist="Kylie_Minogue" title="We_Are_One">
[VERBAL:]
Let me know who's down who's not down
Who is real? Who is faking?
There is no vacancy there is no station
Nobody provides any information
We face the fatal situation, but they are pretending like nothing happened
This is mayday that appears on the horizon
We are standing at the forefront to rebuild and reconstruct
[Kylie Minogue:]
From where I stand, from what I feel
Want to put my arms around you, help you heal
Keep you in my heart, wrap you up in love
We're all the same, gotta share the pain, lift you up
We are one, we are one
You make me say
Na na na, na na na
(Let me hear you sing)
We are one, we are one
You make me say
Na na na, na na na
(You make me say - na na na, na na na...)
[VERBAL:]
You know the ambience is obvious
No one is victorious, in this situation, you ask why?
If you wanna speak up, you better stay anonymous
Your voices are been monitored
Why? Whose philosophy are they forcing us?
What lobbyists?
Out thoughts are being kidnapped by them
I know they watching every single move
We gotta keep fighting this battle till we drop
But I believe someday we will see
We don't have to feel alone
We are not alone, someday we will see
Just turn our back on the past and believe, we are one
[Kylie Minogue:]
We are one, we are one
You make me say
Na na na, na na na
(Let me hear you sing)
We are one, we are one
You make me say
Na na na, na na na
Somewhere I stand from what I feel
Want to put my arms around you, help you heal
Keep you in my heart, wrap you up in love
We're all the same, gotta share the pain, lift you up
We are one, we are one
You make me say
Na na na, na na na
We are one, we are one
You make me say
Na na na, na na na
You make me say
Na na na, na na na
We can unite, we can light up the darkness
We can unite, we can light up the darkness
We can unite, we can light up the darkness
We can unite, we can light up the darkness
