<song artist="Kylie_Minogue" title="Can't_Beat_The_Feeling">
There doesn't have to be a reason
There doesn't have to be a why
And any moment could be magical
It could be this night
You've got an energy 
Burnin' like I've never seen
Bringing me to life 
And I 
Can't beat the feeling 
That I get 
When I'm 
With you
My heart plays a rhythm in my head
I can't help
But move
Two people synchronized
It's like a power
Brings you closer
Right inside and
I can't beat the feeling 
That I get 
When I'm 
With you
Feel the force of the reaction
Let it take you on a ride
And all resistance is illogical
When your love slides
We got an energy
Fast revolving 'round our feet
Bringin' us to life
And I
Can't beat the feeling 
That I get
When I'm
with you
My heart plays a rhythm in my head
I can't help
But move
Two people synchronized
It's like a power
Brings you closer
Right inside and
I can't beat the feeling 
That I get 
When I'm 
with you
We've got an energy
We've got an energy
We've got an energy
We've got an energy
We've got an energy
(We've got an energy)
(We've got an energy)
(We've got an energy, energy, energy...)
We've got an energy
Burnin' like I've never seen
We've got an energy
Bringin' us to life
And I can't beat the feeling 
That I
Get when I'm 
with you
My heart plays a rhythm in my head
I can't help
But move
Two people synchronized
It's like a power
Brings you closer
Right beside it
I can't beat the feeling 
That I get 
When I'm 
with you
Oooooh, yeah
Oooooh, yeah
Oooooh, yeah
Oooooh, yeah
