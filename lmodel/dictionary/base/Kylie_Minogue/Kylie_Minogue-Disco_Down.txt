<song artist="Kylie_Minogue" title="Disco_Down">
(Burned this disco
Burned this disco
Burned this disco
Burned this disco
Burned this disco
Burned this disco)
I've been thinking reminiscing
'bout the days when we were wishing
We could fly and touch the sky
Laughing, meeting under cover
Running, hiding from your mother
If we tried we could do anything
And when the DJ came to town
People came from miles around
Baby I still recall those things 
And ooh I'm missing you now
I'm missing you now
And you turned my world around
When you burned this disco down
Why d'you leave to find yourself
I can't dance with no one else
And still there's memories of this town
When you burned this disco down
Disco down, ohhh
Disco down (and I'll always wonder where you are)
Disco down
(Burned this disco
Burned this disco
Burned this disco)
It's been ten years now this Sunday
Since you left or was it Monday
Time can fly when you're still in love
And now I boogie in my dreams 
To le Freak or Dancing Queen
Baby I still recall those things
And ooh I'm missing you now
I'm missing you now
And you turned my world around
When you burned this disco down
Why d'you leave to find yourself
I can't dance with no one else
And still there's memories of this town
When you burned this disco down
Disco down, down
Disco down, oooh
And oh, now the dance has died for sure
Since your love ain't here no more
Still I wonder where you are
"I'll always wonder where you are"
And you turned my world around (Burned disco)
When you burned this disco down
why d'you leave to find yourself
I can't dance with no one else
And still there's memories of this town
When you burned this disco down
Disco down
