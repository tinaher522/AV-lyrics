<song artist="Kylie_Minogue" title="Aston_Martin_(Let's_Go)">
24 hour sunset,
I got a tank of gas and...
all the things I can do when driving with you in my Aston
(Oh oh oh oh!)
It's a perfect chance (oh oh oh oh!)
for some romance (oh oho oh oh!)
with a little luck now baby,
(oh oh oh oh!)
we might get to start
(oh oh oh oh!)
CHORUS:
In my Aston Martin,
(oh oh ooh oh!)
we might get started,
(oh oh ooh oh!)
in my Aston Martin
(oh oh ooh oh!)
Let's go!
(oh oh ooh oh!)
In my Aston Martin,
(oh oh ooh oh!)
you can call me darling,
(oh oh ooh oh!)
in my Aston Martin
(oh oh ooh oh!)
Let's go!
(oh oh ooh oh!)
I love the records playing,
on a late night radio,
just anticipating how much faster we can go
(oh oh ooh oh!)
It's a perfect chance (oh oh ooh oh!)
for some romance (oh oh ooh oh!)
got my fingers crossed now baby,
(oh oh ooh oh!)
That we get locked...
(oh oh ooh oh!)
REPEAT CHORUS:
Way down by the sea,
is where I wanna be,
way down by the sea,
is where I wanna be,
way down by the sea,
(in my Aston Martin)
is where I wanna be,
(we might get started)
way down by the sea,
(in my Aston Martin)
is where I wanna be,
way down by the sea,
(in my Aston Martin)
is where I wanna be,
(we might get started)
way down by the sea,
(in my Aston Martin)
is where I wanna be,
(Let's go!)
