<song artist="Kylie_Minogue" title="Your_Disco_Needs_You_(Spanish_Version)">
Your disco, your disco, your disco needs you
Your disco, your disco, your disco needs you
Desperately seeking someone, willing to travel
You're lost in conversation and useless at Scrabble
Happiness will never last, darkness comes to kick your ass
So let's dance through all our fears, war is over for a bit
The whole world should be moving do your part, cure a lonely heart.
Your disco, your disco, your disco needs you
Your disco, your disco, your disco needs you 
We're sold on vanity, but that's so see through
Take your body to the floor, your disco needs you
From Soho to Singapore, from the mainland to the shore
So let's dance through all our fears, war is over for a bit
You're a slave to the rhythm do your part, cure a lonely heart.
Oooh Oooh Oooh, Oooh Oooh Oooh Ahaaaaaaaaaa
Oooh Oooh Oooh, Oooh Oooh Oooh Ahaaaaaaaaaa.
Nunca estas sola, sabes lo que tienes que hacer
No vayas a tu pueblo, tu discoteca te necesita
So let's dance through all our fears, war is over for a bit
The whole world should be moving do your part, cure a lonely heart
Your disco, your disco, your disco needs you ...
Your disco, your disco, your disco needs you ...
Your disco, your disco, your disco needs you ...
Your disco, your disco, your disco needs.. YOU!
