<song artist="Kylie_Minogue" title="No_More_Rain">
Have you ever thought that the sky was just endlessly dark?
And then you look up and see a million stars
Have you ever been scared of the water and stuck on the edge?
And then you dive in, how quickly you forget
Your fears that kept you away at night
Now that I'm back in the light so warm
I feel it like a
Wave of love coming over me
Got a glitter drop fall and I'm on my knees
Got the sound of you ringing in my ears
Sun coming up on another day
Got a second hand chance, gonna do it again
Got rainbow colours and no more rain
(No more rain, no more rain)
No more rain
No more rain
No more rain
No more
Have you ever dreamt you were flying until you look down?
You never moved and inch, feet firmly on the ground
Our love carries the hurt that you hold
Funny how life can unfold
Oh yeah, I feel it like a
Wave of love coming over me
Got a glitter drop fall and I'm on my knees
Got the sound of you ringing in my ears
Sun coming up on another day
Got a second hand chance, gonna do it again
Got rainbow colours and no more rain
(No more rain, no more rain)
No more rain
No more rain
No more rain
No more
(Spoken)
Wave of love coming over me
Got a glitter drop fall and I'm on my knees
Got the sound of you ringing in my ears
Sun coming up on another day
Got a second hand chance, gonna do it again
Got rainbow colours and no more rain
Wave of love coming over me
Got a glitter drop fall and I'm on my knees
Got the sound of you ringing in my ears
Sun coming up on another day
Got a second hand chance, gonna do it again
Got rainbow colours and no more rain
(No more rain, no more rain)
No more rain
No more rain
No more rain
No more
Got a glitter drop fall and I'm on my knees
Got the sound of you ringing in my ears
Sun coming up on another day
Got a second hand chance, gonna do it again
Got rainbow colours and no more rain
(No more rain, no more rain)
No more rain
No more rain
No more rain
No more
