<song artist="Kylie_Minogue" title="Put_Your_Hands_Up_(If_You_Feel_Love)">
Look around, I see a million different faces,
But no one's looking in my eyes
It takes a minute when I'm in these different places,
To realize
All we need is love in this life it's true
All I need is the love I get from you
And I wanna scream it out
If you hear what I'm saying
Put your hands up, 
If you feel love tonight
If you feel love
Now put your hands up, 
If you feel love tonight
If you feel love
No matter what we're going to take this moment
Now come on baby, you can show me
So put your hands up, if you feel love tonight
If you feel love
Everybody knows how life can get so twisted,
But I won't let it bring me down
There's no point in ever trying to resist it,
Just work it out
All we need is love in this life it's true
All I need is the love I get from you
So put your hands up, 
If you feel love tonight
If you feel love
Now put your hands up, 
If you feel love tonight
If you feel love
No matter what we're going to take this moment
Now come on baby, you can show me
So put your hands up, if you feel love tonight
If you feel love
If your calling out tonight
Let me hear it now
Said, if your calling out tonight,
Let me hear it
Now put your hands up,
If you feel love
Now put your hands up
If you feel love
So put your hands up, 
If you feel love tonight
If you feel love
Now put your hands up, 
If you feel love tonight
If you feel love
No matter what we're going to take this moment
Now come on baby, you can show me
So put your hands up, if you feel love tonight
If you feel love
