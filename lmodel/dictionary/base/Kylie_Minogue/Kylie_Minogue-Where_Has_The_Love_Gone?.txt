Where has the love gone
(Where's the love, where's the love?)
Where has the love gone
(Where's the love, where's the love?)
Where has the love gone
(Where's the love, where's the love?)
Where has the love gone
(Where's the love, where's the love?)
It's not easy taking all responsibilities
Think it's time that we should know
What we really need
If the love has gone then you don't want to stay
Then hey baby we can go our separate ways 
Ohhh la la la la la
Ohhh la la la la la
I thought that love we had was
Oh so hard to break 
But now I know that it was all give and no take
One sided love affair is
Oh no good to me
I'm a woman and I've got my vanity
Where has the love gone
(Where's the love, where's the love?)
Where has the love gone
(Where's the love, where's the love?)
Where has the love gone
(Where's the love, where's the love?)
Where has the love gone
(Where's the love, where's the love?)
You might assume like everything was going fine
When there was really something 
Deep inside your mind
Let's set it down then maybe we can work it out
There's no need to raise our voices
Scream, or shout
Ohhh la la la la la
Ohhh la la la la la
Where has the love gone
(Where's the love, where's the love?)
Where has the love gone
(Where's the love, where's the love?)
Where has the love gone
(Where's the love, where's the love?)
Where has the love gone
(Where's the love, where's the love?)
Ohhh la la la la la
Ohhh la la la la la
I've come to terms about the way you really feel
I know the love we have is no longer real
Where has the love gone
(Where's the love, where's the love?)
Where has the love gone
(Where's the love, where's the love?)
Where has the love gone
(Where's the love, where's the love?)
Where has the love gone
(Where's the love, where's the love?)
A love so strong (a love so strong)
Where did it go wrong (where did it go wrong)
A love so strong (a love so strong)
Where did it go wrong (where did it go wrong)
A love so strong (a love so strong)
Where did it go wrong (where did it go wrong)
A love so strong (a love so strong)
Where did it go wrong (where did it go wrong)
A love so strong (a love so strong)
Where did it go wrong (where did it go wrong)
A love so strong (a love so strong)
Where did it go wrong (where did it go wrong)
Where has the love gone, a love so strong
Where did it go
Where did the love go? 
Oooh, oh oh oh oh
Where did the love go
Where did the love go
