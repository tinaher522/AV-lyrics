<song artist="Kylie_Minogue" title="Spinning_Around">
Spinning around, spinning around, oh
I'm spinning around, move outta my way
I know you're feeling me 'cause you like it like this
I'm breaking it down, I'm not the same
I know you're feeling me 'cause you like it like this
Traded in some sorrow for some joy that I borrowed
From back in the day
Threw away my old clothes, got myself a better wardrobe
I got something to say
I'm through with the past, ain't no point in looking back
The future will be
And did I forget to mention that I found a new direction
And it leads back to me, yeah
I'm spinning around, move outta my way
I know you're feeling me 'cause you like it like this
I'm breaking it down, I'm not the same
I know you're feeling me 'cause you like it like this
The mistakes I've made have given me the strength
To really believe
That no matter how I take it, there's no way I'm gonna fake it
'Cause it's gotta be real
I've got nothing left to hide, no reason left to fight
'Cause the truth's given me
A new freedom inside getting rid of my desire
Do you like what you see
I'm spinning around, move outta my way
I know you're feeling me 'cause you like it like this
I'm breaking it down, I'm not the same
I know you're feeling me 'cause you like it like this
Baby, baby, baby, ooh, ooh, you know you like it like this
Oh, baby, baby, baby, you know you like it like this
Oh, baby, baby, baby (baby, baby, baby)
I'm spinning around, move outta my way
I know you're feeling me 'cause you like it like this
I'm breaking it down, I'm not the same
I know you're feeling me 'cause you like it like this
Feeling me 'cause you like it like this, oh, I'm not the same
I know you like it like this, oh, ooh, yeah
Like it like this, like it like this
I'm not the same (I'm not the same)
I'm not the same (I'm not the same), oh
