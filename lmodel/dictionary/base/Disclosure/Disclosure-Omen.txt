<song artist="Disclosure" title="Omen">
I'm feeling something, something different
When you'd left, I'd appeared to change
I was blinded, I'd not envisioned
The same face in a different frame
It's an omen, caught my baby crying
Saw the silver lining
It must be an omen
Needed you to show me without you I'm downing
My mind would ruin my heart
I didn't pay attention to the light in the dark
It left me torn apart
But now I see your tears are an omen
Oh-Oh-Oh...
Omen
You were waiting, I was vacant
You left before my eyes, then it hit me
You're relocating and I need you by my side
It's an omen, caught my baby crying
Saw the silver lining
It must be an omen
Needed you to show me without you I'm downing
My mind would ruin my heart
I didn't pay attention to the light in the dark
It left me torn apart
But now I see your tears are an omen
My mind would ruin my heart
I didn't pay attention to the light in the dark
It left me torn apart
But now I see your tears are an omen
Oh-Oh-Oh...
Omen
(Woah, now love)
Oh-Oh-Oh...
Omen
(I didn't pay attention to the light in the dark)
Oh-Oh-Oh...
Omen
(But now I see your tears are an omen)
Oh-Oh-Oh...
Omen
(Now I see your tears are an omen)
Oh-Oh-Oh...
Omen
Oh-Oh-Oh...
Omen
