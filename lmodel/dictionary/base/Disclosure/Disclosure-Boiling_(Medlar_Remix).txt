<song artist="Disclosure" title="Boiling_(Medlar_Remix)">
Something is boiling, boiling in me
Someone is toying, toying with me
It won't get out, it won't stop
It don't move out, it won't leave
It won't get out, it won't stop
I leave it now...
Someone's ignoring, ignoring defeat
But the taste of your poison
Your poison is sweet, so sweet
He won't give up, but I won't up and go
I don't know how
He won't give up, but I won't up and go
He's had enough...
I leave it now...
Something is boiling, boiling in me
Someone is toying, toying with me
It won't get out, it won't stop
It don't move out, it won't leave
It won't get out, it won't stop
I leave it now...
Someone's ignoring, ignoring defeat
But the taste of your poison,
Your poison is sweet, so sweet
He won't give up, but I won't up and go
I don't know how
He won't give up, but I won't up and go
He's had enough, enough...
