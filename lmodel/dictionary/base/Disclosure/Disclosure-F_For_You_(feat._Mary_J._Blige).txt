I've been infected with restless whispers and cheats
Now manifested in words and the lies that you speak
I've been infected with restless whispers and cheats
Now manifested in words and the lies that you speak
Both
I've been infected with restless whispers and cheats
Now manifested in words and the lies that you speak
I've been infected with restless whispers and cheats
Now manifested in words and the lies that you speak
Because I play the fool for ya
Because I play the fool for you
Because I play the fool for ya
Because I play the fool for you
Because I, because I, because I, because I...
Mary J. Blige
Your love is so beautiful
And I'll play the fool for you
Boy, your love is so beautiful
And I'll play the fool for you babe
It makes me feel so good when you hold me tight
Hold to want me back
You make everything alright!
Boy, your love is so beautiful
And I'll play, I'll play, I'll play the fool for you
Howard Lawrence
Because I play the fool for ya
Because I play the fool for you
Because I play the fool for ya
Because I play the fool for you
Because I, because I, because I, because I...
Mary J. Blige
Boy your love got me in a daze
And I'd do anything you say
Boy your love got me in a daze
And I'd do anything you say babe
You give me what I need
Baby, you're the one
Always be my king, can't nobody take your crown
Boy your love is so beautiful
And I'll play, I'll play, I'll play the fool for you
Howard Lawrence
Because I play the fool for ya
Because I play the fool for you
Because I play the fool for ya
Because I play the fool for you
Because I play the fool for ya
Because I play the fool for you
Because I play the fool for ya
Because I play the fool for you
Mary J. Blige
I'll play, I'll play, I'll play...
Howard Lawrence
Because I play the fool for ya
Because I play the fool for you
Because I play the fool for ya
Because I play the fool for you
Mary J. Blige
I'll play, I'll play, I'll play...
Howard Lawrence
Because I, because I, because I, because I...
I've been infected with restless whispers and cheats
Now manifested in words and the lies that you speak
I've been infected with restless whispers and cheats
Now manifested in words and the lies that you speak
I've been infected... now manifested...
I've been infected... now manifested...
Mary J. Blige
I'll play babe
