<song artist="Disclosure" title="The_Mechanism">
So one of the things I need y'all to do for me is
You gotta know that it's coming
And once you know it's coming
Once you know it's coming
Stay in the zone
Stay in your body
Increase your maximum level
It's one simple reason
The mechanism of incessant, incessant, habitual conceptualization
Creation of ideas, goals and frameworks
That are turned over
Completed
To the friend within
You know it's coming
You know it's coming
You know it's coming
You know it, you know it, you know it, you know it's coming
You know it's coming
You know it, you know it, you know it, you know it's coming
So one of the things I need y'all to do for me is
You gotta know that it's coming
And once you know it's coming
Once you know it's coming
Stay in the zone
Stay in your body
Increase your maximum level
It's one simple reason
The mechanism of incessant, incessant, habitual conceptualization
Creation of ideas, goals and frameworks
That are turned over
Completed
You know it's coming
You know it's coming
