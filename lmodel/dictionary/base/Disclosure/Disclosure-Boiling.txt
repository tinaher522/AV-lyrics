<song artist="Disclosure" title="Boiling">
Something is boiling, boiling in me
Someone is toying, toying with me
It won't get out, it won't stop
It don't move out, it won't leave
It won't get out, it won't stop
It don't move out
I need it now, eh...
I need it now, eh...
I need it now, eh...
I need it now, eh...
Someone's ignoring, ignoring defeat
But the taste of your poison
Your poison is sweet, so sweet
He won't give up, but I won't up and go
I don't know how
He won't give up, but I won't up and go
He's had enough, I won't leave
He won't give up, but I won't up and go
I don't know how
He won't give up, but I won't up and go
He's had enough
I need it now, ooh ooh...
I need it now, ooh ooh...
I need it now, ooh ooh...
I need it now, eh...
Took my heart and kept it
Now my wounds are setting
There's no choice I could do
I've become so reckless
All my love's affected
With the remnants of you
You
I neet it now, eh...
I neet it now, eh...
Ohh
(I neet it now...)
