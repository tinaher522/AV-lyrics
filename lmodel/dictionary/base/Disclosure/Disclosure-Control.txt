Control
Control, show me
You're not, control, show me
Don't know where I...
Control, show it
You're not what you wanna take
Control it, show me
Control
Staring in your eyes
I felt my desire
You can't take control
Of the love we fight
Control, show me
Take control, show me
Show me control
You're not what you wanna look
You and me will take control, control
And with this time make it all on
You and me will take control, control
And with this time make it all on
Show me, show me, show me, show me
You're not what you wanna take, control
Show me, show me, show me
You're not what you wanna, show me
All we're fighting by the thought of losing out your beat alone
Won't be the one who has to see without you
By the time I know I want my way I know that you gonna want to take me home
Let it happen and you'll be the one to
And you'll take the time to...
No back in time no... nothing else will come between us
With you enough to say no use and tell me what to do
All this...
Let me catch my breath
Hold me to your chest
Feel our hearts collide
From the other side
Keep it close to you
Until the night is through
You're still in control
From the other side
You and me will take control, control
And with this time make it all on
You and me will take control
And with this time make it all on, control
Show me
You're not, control, show me
Control, show me
You're not what you wanna take
Show me, you
Show me, you
