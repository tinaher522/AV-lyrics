Defeated no more
I just feel I let you go
Been cheated, I've been fooled
But in my heart I'm glowing gold
Gotta let this fire keep burning
'Cause I can't seem to let this show
Instead of running out I keep it slow
'Cause I won't let this take control
Got to get it
Got-got to get it on
Got to get it
Got-got to get it on up
Got to get it
Got-got to get it on
Got to get it
Got-got to get it on up
Defeated no more
I stood and watched you take it all
I'm healing and reborn
But now I'm shaking off the cold
Gotta let this fire keep burning
'Cause I can't seem to let this show
Instead of running out I keep it slow
'Cause I won't let this take control
Got to get it
Got-got to get it on
Got to get it
Got-got to get it on up
Got to get it
Got-got to get it on
Got to get it
Got-got to get it on up
I can feel it working 
I'm the last to know 
(I know you feel it working but can you love?)
I can feel it working 
I'm the last to know 
(I know you think you have but can you love?)
I can feel it working 
I'm the last to know 
(I know you feel it working but can you love?)
I can feel it working 
I'm the last to know
(I know you feel the love, can you love, can you love, can you love?)
Defeated no more
I feel your shadow disappear
I've pleaded and I've fought
But now I know I'll make the rewards
Gotta let this fire keep burning
'Cause I can't seem to let this show
Instead of running out I keep it slow
'Cause I won't let this take control
Got to get it
Got-got to get it on
Got to get it
Got-got to get it on up
Got to get it
Got-got to get it on
Got to get it
Got-got to get it on up
Got to get it
Got-got to get it on
Got to get it
Got-got to get it on up
Got to get it
Got-got to get it on
Got to get it
Got-got to get it on up
Got to get it
Got-got to get it on
Got to get it
Got-got to get it on up
Got to get it
Got-got to get it on
Got to get it
Got-got to get it on up
I can feel it working 
I'm the last to know 
(I know you feel it working but can you love?)
I can feel it working 
I'm the last to know 
(I know you think you have but can you love?)
I can feel it working 
I'm the last to know 
(I know you feel it working but can you love?)
I can feel it working 
I'm the last to know
(I know you feel the love, can you love, can you love, can you love?)
