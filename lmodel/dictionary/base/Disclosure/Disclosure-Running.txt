You keep me
Keep me running, you keep me running
Keep me running, you keep me running
You keep me
Keep me running, you keep me running
Keep me running, you keep me running
I'm lost again, it's happening
When you're around I just go away
All I wanna know, is it mutual
Then I never want to leave
Then I'm ready to run, ready to fall
Think I'm ready
I'm lost again, it's happening
When you're around I just go away
All I wanna know, is it mutual
Then I never want to leave
Then I'm ready to run, ready to fall
Think I'm ready to loose it all
I'm lost again, it's happening
When you're around I just go away
All I wanna know, is it mutual
Then I never want to leave
Then I'm ready to run, ready to fall
Think I'm ready to loose it all
I'm lost again, it's happening
When you're around I just go away
All I wanna know, is it mutual
Then I never want to leave
Then I'm ready to run, ready to fall
Think I'm ready to loose it all
Whoa, would you hold my hand like the air it's so gently here
Never give up, never give up
Whoa, would you pull me closer and nobody knows we're there
No one can find us
Whoa, would you hold my hand like the air it's so gently here
Never give up, never give up
Whoa, would you pull me closer and nobody knows we're there
No one can find us
I'm lost again, it's happening
When you're around I just go away
All I wanna know, is it mutual
Then I never want to leave
Then I'm ready to run, ready to fall
Think I'm ready to loose it all
Then I'm ready to run, ready to fall
Think I'm ready to loose it all
Keep me running
Keep me running
Keep me running, you keep me running
Keep me running, you keep me running
Keep me running, you keep me running
Keep me running, you keep me running
Keep me running, you keep me running
Keep me running, you keep me running
Keep me running, you keep me running
Keep me running, you keep me running
Keep me running, you keep me running
Keep me running, you keep me running
And I'm lost again, it's happening
When you're around I just go away
All I wanna know, is it mutual
Then I never want to leave
Then I'm ready to run, ready to fall
Think I'm ready to loose it all
Then I'm ready to run, ready to fall
Think I'm ready to loose it all
Whoa, would you hold my hand like the air it's so gently here
Never give up, never give up
Whoa, would you pull me closer and nobody knows we're there
No one can find us
Whoa, would you hold my hand like the air it's so gently here
Never give up, never give up
Whoa, would you pull me closer and nobody knows we're there
No one can find us
You keep
You keep
You keep
Keep me running, you keep me running
Keep me running, you keep me running
Keep me running, you keep me running
Keep me running, you keep me running
You keep me
