When a fire starts to burn, right, and it starts to spread
She gon' bring that attitude home
Don't wanna do nothing with their life
When a fire starts to burn, right, and it starts to spread
She gon' bring that attitude home
Don't wanna do nothing with their life
When a fire starts to burn, right, and it starts to spread
She gon' bring that attitude home
Don't wanna do nothing with their life
When a fire starts to burn, right, and it starts to spread
She gon' bring that attitude home
Don't wanna do nothing with their life
When a fire starts to
When a fire starts to
When a fire starts to burn, right, and it starts to spread
She gon' bring that attitude home
Don't wanna do nothing with their life
When a fire starts to burn, right, and it starts to spread
She gon' bring that attitude home
Don't wanna do nothing with their life
When a fire starts to burn, right, and it starts to spread
She gon' bring that attitude home
Don't wanna do nothing with their life
When a fire starts to burn, right, and it starts to spread
She gon' bring that attitude home
Don't wanna do nothing with their life
When a fire starts to
When a fire starts to
When a fire starts to burn, right, and it starts to spread
She gon' bring that attitude home
Don't wanna do nothing with their life
When a fire starts to burn, right, and it starts to spread
She gon' bring that attitude home
Don't wanna do nothing with their life
When a fire starts to burn, right, and it starts to spread
She gon' bring that attitude home
Don't wanna do nothing with their life
When a fire starts to burn, right, and it starts to spread
She gon' bring that attitude home
Don't wanna do nothing with their life
When a fire starts
When a fire starts to burn, right, and it starts to spread
She gon' bring that attitude home
Don't wanna do nothing with their life
When a fire starts to burn, right, and it starts to spread
She gon' bring that attitude home
Don't wanna do nothing with their life

When a fire starts to burn, right, and it starts to spread
She gon' bring that attitude home
