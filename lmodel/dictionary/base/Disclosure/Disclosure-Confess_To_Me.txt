<song artist="Disclosure" title="Confess_To_Me">
I can help you run away for good
Overtake what you had understood
All it takes is a little understanding
After all, don’t question if I would
Confess to me, make me feel it
Confide in me, don’t resent it
‘Cause I can’t stop you from nothing
I’ll fulfill your desires for you
Confess to me, make me feel it
Confide in me, don’t resent it
‘Cause I can’t stop you from nothing
I’ll fulfill your desires for you
I’ll fulfill your desires for you
I’ll fulfill your desires for you
I can take the 'low' out of lonely
I can stop the sense of slowing down
Know you're lost but if you only tell me
I will help just let me turn it round
Owning up to early
No time left for me
Owning up to early
No time left for me
Owning up to early
No time left for me
Owning up to early
No time left for me
Confess to me, make me feel it
Confide in me, don’t resent it
‘Cause I can’t stop you from nothing
I’ll fulfill your desires for you
Confess to me, make me feel it
Confide in me, don’t resent it
‘Cause I can’t stop you from nothing
I’ll fulfill your desires for you
I’ll fulfill your desires for you
I’ll fulfill your desires for you
I’ll fulfill your desires for you
I’ll fulfill your desires for you
