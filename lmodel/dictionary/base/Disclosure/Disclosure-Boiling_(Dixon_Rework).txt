<song artist="Disclosure" title="Boiling_(Dixon_Rework)">
It won't stop, it don't move out, it won't stop...
Something is boiling, boiling in me
Someone is toying, toying with me
It won't get out, it won't stop
It don't move out, it won't leave
It won't get out, it won't stop
It don't move out
Someone's ignoring, ignoring defeat
But the taste of your poison
Your poison is sweet, so sweet
He won't give up, but I won't up and go
I don't know how
He won't give up, but I won't up and go
He's had enough, I won't leave
He won't give up, but I won't up and go
I don't know how
He won't give up, but I won't up and go
He's had enough
Took my heart and kept it 
Now my wounds are septic
There's no choice but to lose
I've become so reckless
All my love's infected 
With the remnants of you
Took my heart and kept it 
Now my wounds are septic
There's no choice but to lose
I've become so reckless
All my love's infected 
With the remnants of you
