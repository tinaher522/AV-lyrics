<song artist="Disclosure" title="You_&_Me">
I’ll be giving up, oh
Home is where the heart is
And I gave it to you in a paper bag
Even though it’s tarnished
You told me it’s the best you ever had
You've got my secret combination
And I don’t be giving that out easily
With my deepest dedication
I can tell that you have got the same for me
So please don’t let go 
'Cause you know 
Exactly what we found
So please don’t let go 
My darling
And keep it locked up underground
It’s gonna be you and me
It’s gonna be everything you’ve ever dreamed
I'm gonna be who you need
It’s gonna be everything and everything we’re meant to be
We’re meant to be
Rolling with the punches
So they won’t get inside our happiness
Love is always hunted
Well your arrows are soaring through my chest
'Cause you know you give me something
Yeah you give me exactly what I need
Got my blood pumping
You know each drop of blood I need
So please don’t let go 
'Cause you know 
Exactly what we found
So please don’t let go 
My darling
And keep it locked up underground
It’s gonna be you and me
It’s gonna be everything you’ve ever dreamed
I'm gonna be who you need
It’s gonna be everything and everything we’re meant to be
In your big house on the hill
Where you keep your dollar bills
And you stashed my heart
Somewhere in the dark
Keep it safe I know you will
Know you will
Know you will
Know you will
I know you will
