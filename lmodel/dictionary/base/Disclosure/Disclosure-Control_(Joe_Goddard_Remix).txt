<song artist="Disclosure" title="Control_(Joe_Goddard_Remix)">
You can take control
Control, control
You're not, control, show me
Control, control
Control, control
Control
Let me catch my breath
Hope me do your chance
Feel our hearts cut out
From the other sign
Let me catch my breath
Hope me do your chance
Feel our hearts cut out
From the other sign
Control, control
Staring in your eyes
I felt my desire
You can't take control
Of the love we fight
You and me, you and me
You and me, you and me
Staring in your eyes
I felt my desire
You can't take control
Of the love we fight
Let me catch my breath
Control, control
Control, control
All we're fighting by the thought of losing out your beat alone
Won't be the one who has to see without you
By the time I know I want my way I know that you you wanna take me home
Let it happen and you'll be the one to
And you'll take the time to...
No back in time no... nothing else will come between us
With you enough to say no use and tell me what to do
All this...
Control, control
Control, control
You can't take control
