<song artist="Disclosure" title="January">
Tell me just what I should be expecting
‘Cause here I am on my own free will
Fortune favors the brave
So they say
I might as well fix up and play your game
Make the memory the reason
Remembering the time when you and I fell behind
But found a way justify
We cannot replay
The aesthetic or feel
We had our brighter day
Was it synthetic or real?
I'll protect the memory
If baby you can’t recall it
You can’t recall that
22nd January
If baby you can’t recall it
I won’t forget that
I'll protect the memory
If baby you can’t recall it
You can’t recall that
22nd January
If baby you can’t recall it
I won’t forget that
Was it just as real as you expected?
Does looking back give you a chill?
Show me something you prefer today
Or maybe you’ve grown up and I'm the same
That amnesia gives you freedom
Or maybe you’re a kind that tells a lie just to lie
And never have to say goodbye
And we cannot replay
The aesthetic or feel
We had our brighter day
Was it synthetic or real?
I'll suspend your disbelief
Putting faith in your relief
I'll suspend your disbelief
Putting faith in your relief
I'll suspend your disbelief
Putting faith in your relief
I'll suspend your disbelief
I'll protect the memory
If baby you can’t recall it
You can’t recall that
22nd January
If baby you can’t recall it
I won’t forget that
I'll protect the memory
If baby you can’t recall it
You can’t recall that
22nd January
If baby you can’t recall it
I won’t forget that
I'll protect the memory
If baby you can’t recall it
You can’t recall that
22nd January
If baby you can’t recall it
I won’t forget that
