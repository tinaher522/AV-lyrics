<song artist="Extreme" title="Flesh_'N'_Blood">
Hey, anybody know what time it is?
Flesh and blood, a human fascination
Acquired the taste right on my face
Naughty
Lost in lust, a hopeless situation
Well, let the game begin, I'm shirts, you're skins
Naughty
Well, these hunger pains
Growing inside me every day
I feel it in my veins
Burning inside me every day
I wanna eat your body
(Eat your body)
Naughty, naughty, naughty
Talkin' 'bout your body
Flesh, blood
I think I'm in love
Naughty, naughty, naughty
(Eating up your body)
Diving down, a sticky occupation, yeah
I need another shot of some food for thought
Naughty
Well, these hunger pains
Growing inside me every day
I feel it in my veins
Burning inside me every day
I wanna eat your body
(Eat your body)
Naughty, naughty, naughty
Talkin' 'bout your body
Flesh, blood
I think I'm in love
Naughty, naughty, naughty
(Eating up your body)
Ooh, naughty, naughty, naughty
(Eating up your body)
I think it's supper time!
Everybody's got a need
Everybody's got to feed
On everybody else's body
Everybody's got a need
Everybody's got to feed
On everybody
I wanna eat your body
Naughty, naughty, naughty
Talkin' 'bout your...
F-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-flesh, blood
I think I'm in love
Naughty, naughty, naughty
(Eating up your body)
I wanna eat your body
(Eat your body)
Naughty, naughty, naughty
Talkin' 'bout your body
I wanna eat your body
Naughty, naughty, naughty
Talkin' 'bout your...
F-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-flesh, blood
I think I'm in love
Na-na-na-na-naughty
(Eating up your body)
