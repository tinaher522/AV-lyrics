<song artist="Extreme" title="Cynical">
today don't look so bad,compared to tomorrow
if time is all we have,then we're living on borrowed
yesterday's for fools who try to,try to remember(try to remember)
the good ol' days weren't always that much better
'Cause I'm a cynical (fuck)
Well I ain't nothing but a cynical (fuck)
It don't take much to be a cynical
(All you need is love)
All you need is what
To be a cynical (fuck)
Well I ain't nothing but a cynical (fuck)
It don't take much to be a cynical
(All you need is love)
All you need is what
And whatever you do, someone's done it first
though it's sad but true this is just another verse
if you can't take it with you then what's the use
(What's the use) What's the use
I never saw a u-haul being pulled behind, pulled behind a hearse
'Cause I'm a cynical (fuck)
Well I ain't nothing but a cynical (fuck)
It don't take much to be a cynical
(All you need is love)
All you need is what
To be a cynical (fuck)
Well I ain't nothing but a cynical (fuck)
It don't take much to be a cynical
(All you need is love)
All you need is what
looks like my brighter side
has gotten a bit darker
i must have stepped over
my four leaf clover
'cause someone drank my
half-filled cup of water
            (SOLO)
Cynical (fuck)
I ain't nothing but a cynical (fuck)
I don't wanna be a cynical
(All you need is love)
All you need is what
To be a cynical (fuck)
I ain't nothing but a cynical (fuck)
I don't wanna be a cynical (fuck)
Cynical (fuck)
All you need is love
All you need is love
All you need is what...yeah!
