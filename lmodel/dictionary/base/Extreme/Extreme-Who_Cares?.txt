<song artist="Extreme" title="Who_Cares?">
Tell me, Jesus, are you angry?
One more sheep has just gone astray
A hardening of hearts, turning to stone
Wandering off, so far from home
So many children, losing time
Walk in darkness, looking for a sign
Chasing their rainbows, the future looks so bright
Slowly we're losing, sight of the light
 
(Who cares) Who cares
(Who cares) Who cares
(Who cares) Who Cares
(Tell mw who cares) Who cares
(Who cares) Who cares
(Who cares) Who cares
(Who cares) Who Cares
(Tell mw who cares) Who cares
All alone, out in the cold
Can't look back, am I growing old
I chose a path,is this my fate?
Am I finding out the truth too late?
 
(Who cares) Who cares
(Who cares) Who cares
(Who cares) Who Cares
(Tell mw who cares) Who cares
(Who cares) Who cares
(Who cares) Who cares
(Who cares) Who Cares
(Tell mw who cares) Who cares
        (SOLO)
Here I am, a naked man
Nothing to hide with empty hands
Remember me, well, I am the one
Who lost his way, your Prodigal Son
Woah
Yeah, a-yeah
Can anybody, anybody help me
Who cares? Anybody, oh
Who cares? Anybody, oh
Am I ever gonna change?
Will I always stay the same?
Say one thing then I do the other
Same old song goes on forever
Am I ever gonna change (rise,rise and shine)
Just take it day by day (a new day is coming)
(Yes it is!)
My will is weak and my flesh too strong
This peace I seek till thy kingdom comes!
