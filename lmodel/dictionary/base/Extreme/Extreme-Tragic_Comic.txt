<song artist="Extreme" title="Tragic_Comic">
Flowers, I sent,
were found dead on their arrival
The words, I said,
inserted foot in my mouthful
So when, we dance,
My lead it ain't so graceful
(Isn't so, not ain't so)
 
I'm a hapless romantic
St-t-tuttering p-poet
Just call me a tragic comic
'cause I'm in,in love with you
Ahh
Ahh
 
And when, we dine,
I forget to push in your seat
I wear, the wine,
spilling hearts all over my sleeve
I stitch, in time,
proposing down on my knees
(Splitting between the seams)
 
I'm a hapless romantic
St-t-tuttering p-poet
Just call me a tragic comic
'cause I'm in,in love with you
Ahh
Ahh
 
Nobody can know the trouble I've seen
Nobody can know the trouble I've seen
Nobody can know the trouble I get into
when I'm with you
Tragic comedy
I'm a hapless romantic
St-t-tuttering p-poet
Just call me a tragic comic
'cause I'm in,in love with you
I'm a hapless romantic
St-t-tuttering p-poet
Just call me a tragic comic
'cause I'm in,in love with you
Ahh
Ahh
