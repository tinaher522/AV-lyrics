<song artist="Extreme" title="Don't_Leave_Me_Alone">
Now's not the time to say goodbye
And I'm not the kind to question why
But I don't feel very well
And it's getting cold as hell
It won't be the same
Can't you tell
Don't leave me all alone
Don't leave me on my own
I'm so afraid
Why can't you stay
Just don't leave me alone, oh
Ooh, how long will my song be wrong
Doing the things I should have known
Only to reap what I have sown
Jesus, please
Don't leave me all alone
Don't leave me on my own
I'm on my knees
Forgive me please
Just don't leave me alone
Oh, ooh, How long will my song be wrong
             (KEYBOARD SOLO)
Don't leave me all alone
Don't leave me on my own
I'm so afraid
Why can't you stay
Just don't leave
No, don't leave me alone
Oh, oooh, How long will my song be wrong
