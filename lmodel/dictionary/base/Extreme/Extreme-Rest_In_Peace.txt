<song artist="Extreme" title="Rest_In_Peace">
Let's talk a peace, sounds so cliche
A novelty catch phrase of the day
Middle-index, sign of the time
Just as complex as water to
(Someone said give peace a chance)
And, that's all that was said
(While we're sitting on the fence)
Pretending
(Our hearts are in the right place
But your face shows a trace of)
Hypocrisy
Don't tread on me
Now you can see
"Make love, not war" sounds so absurd to me
We can't afford to say these words lightly
Or else our world will truly rest in peace
(Ban the bomb)
Let's not pretend to justify
Rather amend where treasures lie
Straight through the heart peace can be found
That's where you start, not all around
(Someone said give peace a chance)
And, that's all that was said
(While we're sitting on the fence)
Pretending
(Our hearts are in the right place
But your face shows a trace of)
Hypocrisy
Don't tread on me, boy
Now you can see
"Make love, not war" sounds so absurd to me
We can't afford to say these words lightly
Or else our world will truly rest in peace
"Make love, not war"
Sounds so absurd, ha, sounds so absurd
We can't afford to say these words lightly, ha ha ha ha
Or else our world will truly rest in peace
"Make love, not war" sounds so absurd to me
We can't afford to say these words lightly, yeah
Or else our world will truly rest in peace
Rest in peace, rest in peace, rest in peace, rest in peace
"Make love, not war" sounds so absurd to me
"Make love, not war" sounds so absurd to me (ooh)
We can't afford to say these words lightly (ooh)
Yeah
Or else our world will truly rest in peace
