<song artist="Extreme" title="Peace_(Saudade)">
Heavy is the burden that brings you to your knees
Lost in the confusion of life's uncertainties
Feel you're suffocating with every breath you take
Moment left remaining
Time for you to pray
Time for you to pray
Pray for peace, pray for peace
Pray for peace, pray for peace
Whirl wind she's a-turning the river's on the rise
Suddenly surrounded in the middle, middle of her eye
Light precedes the thunder trembles
Trembles and it shakes
The ground your feet are under
Time for you to pray
Time for you to pray
Pray for peace, pray for peace
Pray for peace, pray for peace
