<song artist="Extreme" title="King_Of_The_Ladies">
Let me introduce you to my time machine
See my suped up bird spread her golden wings
Going back in black through my neighbourhood
My main street middle class Hollywood
Jenny's all jet-set Purple Rain cassette
Looking like she was the queen of the 80's
And if I knew back then what I know right now
Yeah you know I'd be the king of the ladies
If I knew back then what I know right now
You know I'd be the king of the ladies
And if I knew back then what I know right now
There'd be no ifs, and buts and no maybes
Just an average Joe making minimum wage
Burger flipping on the beach instead of hitting the wave
When the girls walk by with their copper tone tan
Sucker punching the clocks, stop working for the man
Well there aint no cure for the summertime blues
Oh Candy, oh would you save me?
And if I knew back then what I know right now
Yeah you know I'd be the king of the ladies
If I knew back then what I know right now
You know I'd be the king of the ladies
And if I knew back then what I know right now
There'd be no ifs, and buts and no maybes
If I knew back then what I know right now
You know I'd be the king of the ladies
And if I knew back then what I know right now
There'd be no ifs, and buts and no maybes
I walked up to the dance in the High school gym
This girl with drop-dead legs, I'm moving in
You know must have been the DJ spinning Billy Jean
I tapped Nikki on the shoulder told dance with me
It's like that scene from Grease the way we bumped to the beat
I had the girl give me the slip she got away from me
Coz if I knew back then what I know right now
You know I'd have the pick of the ladies
If I knew back then what I know right now
You know I'd be the king of the ladies
And if I knew back then what I know right now
There'd be no ifs, and buts and no maybes
If I knew back then what I know right now
You know I'd be the king of the ladies
And if I knew back then what I know right now
There'd be no ifs, and buts and no maybes
If I knew back then what I know right now
You know I'd be the king of the ladies
And if I knew back then what I know right now
There'd be no ifs, and buts and no maybes
If I knew back then what I know right now
You know I'd be the king of the ladies
And if I knew back then what I know right now
There'd be no ifs, and buts and no maybes
