"You read the papers today?"
I read the news today oh boy,
About a tragic comedy
Newspaper hinted suicide,
The letterhead read Dear Johnny
A tainted truth was all it said,
Sleep tight now that you've made your bed
An arrow that once pierced your heart
Points to the apple on your head
Three sides to every story
Yours, mine
And, Monday morning's
CUPID'S DEAD, HEADLINES READ,
CUPID'S DEAD
CUPID'S DEAD, HEADLINES READ,
CUPID'S DEAD
Oh, Romeo, Oh, Romeo
Where did our love go, Romeo?
If you read between the headlines,
You wouldn't be the last to know
No mystery yet to unfold,
A paperboy left in the cold
A love was said to never die,
Withered away and just got old
"Our top story tonight,
Is a crime of passion
The victim, an unidentified man,
Is found in bed, wearing only a diaper,
Holding a bow an arrow in one hand,
And clutching a letter in the other.
The letter simply read ...
CUPID'S DEAD."
Extra, extra, extra,
Read all about it
CUPID'S DEAD,
Cupid is dead, deceased,
I got peace of mind
Still it's hard to forget,
What it leaves behind
A lot of love lost,
Your feelings are wasted,
Tasted the sweetness,
But now you're faced with,
The thought, of being alone
Nor more companionship,
You can handle it,
Just abandon it,
Leave it behind,
And look for the brighter day
Give it some time,
Cause it won't come right away
You gotta be standing strong,
Hold on to your dignity
Don't sit around,
Saying look what ya did to me
It's time to move on,
You gotta continue
To look for a love,
Of a life that's within you
Cupid is dead now,
It's time to rely on,
Yourself to cope
You got no shoulder to cry on
DEAD
