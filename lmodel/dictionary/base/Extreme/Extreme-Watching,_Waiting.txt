<song artist="Extreme" title="Watching,_Waiting">
Yeah
Hanging above the ground
All my limbs are bound
You're on the right hand
With your head down
Tears from eyes that cannot see
He took the blame from me
So shall it be written (written)
So shall it be done
Watching, waiting
Staring at the Son
Not even knowing who you are
Three hours have gone by
We start to question why
Darkness falls in finding out
Why you must die
We can no longer see the Son
The three unite into one
Please forgive us Father (Father)
We know not what we've done
Watching, waiting
Staring at the Son
Not even knowing who you are
Watching, waiting
Staring at the Son
Not even knowing, knowing who you
Watching, waiting
Staring at the Son
Not even knowing Who you are
Watching, waiting
Staring at the Son
Not even knowing, knowing who you are
Yeah
Oh, watching, waiting
Watching, waiting
Oh, oh, yes
Yeah
Watching, waiting, yeah (yeah)
Ahh, yeah, oh
Yeah
Yeah (watching, waiting)
Ah, I'll be there
I'll be there watching
Oh, whoa, yeah
Ahh, there is somebody waiting
Somebody waiting, yeah
