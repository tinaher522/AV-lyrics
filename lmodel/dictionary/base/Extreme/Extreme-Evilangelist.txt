<song artist="Extreme" title="Evilangelist">
Little lamb come out of the rain
You'll catch your death in the cold
A helping hand to come ease your pain
In peace you'll rest in our fold
I can be a watch towering light
For those of you who can't see
I'll separate the truth from the lies
Blind faithful, come follow me, ha, yeah, yeah
Evilangelist (Evilangelist)
Your name is on my list (Evilangelist)
Yeah, I'm your evilangelist (Evilangelist)
In what god you trust
Close your eyes while I hypnotize
A friend in need to confess
You've been denied, the cock crowed thrice
Surrender all you possess
Evilangelist (Evilangelist)
Your name is on my list (Evilangelist)
Yeah, I'm your evilangelist (Evilangelist)
I was betrayed by a kiss
         (SOLO)
So many claim to come in thy name
Promising peace they'll bring
Lest ye taste the fruit of the vine
They're just wolves in sheep's clothing
Evilangelist (Evilangelist)
Your name is on my list (Evilangelist)
Yeah, I'm your evilangelist (Evilangelist)
Evilangelist
In God we trust, ha
