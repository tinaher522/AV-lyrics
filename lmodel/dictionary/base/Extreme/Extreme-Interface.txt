<song artist="Extreme" title="Interface">
Don't just sit there and stare at me
Don't just sit there and watch me bleed
I'm losing you and you, you're losing me
I'm tired of what we are
I'm tired of all the pain
I'm losing you and you, you're losing me
Face lies flat
I see my reflection
Download thoughts
But your files are corrupted
Don't just sit there and stare at me
Don't just sit there and watch me bleed
I'm losing you and you, you're losing me
I'm tired of what we are
I'm tired of all the pain
I'm losing you and you, you're losing me
You, you're losing me
Time stands still
And you're frozen in motion
I held down your escape
But you're crashing, you're crashing
Don't just sit there and stare at me
Don't just sit there and watch me bleed
I'm losing you and you you're losing me
I'm tired of what we are
I'm tired of all the pain
I'm losing you and you you're losing me
Don't just sit there and stare at me
Don't just sit there and watch me bleed
I'm losing you and you you're losing me
I'm tired of what we are
I'm tired of all the pain
I'm losing you
We're losing
We're losing
We're losing
