<song artist="Extreme" title="Wind_Me_Up">
I got something that you ought to know
Don't even know whether to come or go
Up, down, head's spinning around
Wind up in the lost and found
Wind me up, wind me up
(Wind me up, wind me up)
Wind me up, wind me up
Tell me why you make it so hard
All I ask is finish what you start
Wind me up, wind me up
(Wind me up, wind me up)
Wind me up, wind me up
Wind me up, that's all you do
Wind me up and leave me blue
I'd like to see if you could be
Kind enough to me when you wind me up
Don't take me places, then wanna go home
Sometimes I think I'm better off alone
Hey girl, you know what you do
Color me red and leave me blue
Wind me up, wind me up
(Wind me up, wind me up)
Wind me up, wind me up
Wind me up, that's all you do
Wind me up and leave me blue
I'd like to see if you could be
Kind enough to me when you
Wind me up, that's all you do
Wind me up and leave me blue
I'd like to see if you could be
Kind enough to me when you wind me up
Wind me up, that's all you do
Wind me up, and leave me blue
I'd like to see if you could be
kind enough to me when you wind me up
Wind me up, that's all you do
Wind me up and leave me blue
I'd like to see if you could be
Kind enough to me when you
Wind me up, that's all you do
Wind me up and leave me blue
I'd like to see if you could be
Kind enough to me when you
Wind me up, that's all you do
Wind me up and leave me blue
I'd like to see if you could be
Kind enough to me when you wind me up
