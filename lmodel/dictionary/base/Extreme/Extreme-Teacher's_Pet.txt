<song artist="Extreme" title="Teacher's_Pet">
My formal education
Never bothered with my ABC's
Teacher student relation
Taught me all about the birds and bees
Schoolboy fantasy
Lose control Of all my faculties
You know that one thing that got through to me
Was her body chemistry, oh no
Subject to body language
Ain't so hard to read between the lines
I scored above average
Oral examination's where I shine
Schoolboy fantasy
Lose control of all my faculties
Student body
Graduated at the highest degree
You know that one thing that got through to me
Was her body chemistry, oh no, ooh ooh
Purely scientifically
Studied her anatomy, oh no, ooh ooh
One thing that got through to me 
Was her body chemistry, oh no, ooh ooh
Purely, scientifically
(Teacher's pet, teacher's pet)
Studied her anatomy
(God only knows what you do to me)
One thing that got through to me
Was her body chemistry
Purely scientifically
Studied her anatomy
One thing that got through to me (teacher's pet)
Was her body chemistry (teacher's pet)
Purely scientifically (God only knows)
Studied her anatomy (what you do to me)
One thing that got through to me (teacher's pet)
Was her body chemistry (teacher's pet)
Purely scientifically (God only knows)
Studied her anatomy (what you do to me)
Oh no, ooh ooh
