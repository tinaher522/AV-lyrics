<song artist="Extreme" title="Rock_A_Bye_Bye">
If you could only hear the silent screams
When you wake them up from their dreams
Nothing is heard
Not even a, even a, even a word
Rock a bye baby (rock a bye baby)
On the tree top (on the treetop)
When the bough breaks
The cradle will rock
Rock, rock, rock a bye baby
Rock, rock, rock, bye bye
And if they had any choice at all
You still can't hear those voices that call
And when the bough breaks
The cradle will, cradle will, cradle will fall
Rock a by baby (rock a by baby)
On the treetop (on the treetop)
When the bough breaks
The cradle will rock
Rock, rock, rock a bye baby
Rock, rock, rock
