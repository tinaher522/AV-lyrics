<song artist="Extreme" title="Decadence_Dance">
"Francis!
 Francis! Be careful!"
Let's go
Trying so hard to keep up with the Joneses
Running a rat race and won by our noses
Always put one foot in front of the other
And dance to the beat of the decadent drummer
Just buy a brand new pair of Fred Astaire shoes
Climbing to the top, never gonna stop
It's the same old song, and one, two, three
And dec-a-dance
(Dance) Dance
(Dance) Dance
(Dancing to the decadence dance) Dance
Everybody decadancing
Dancing to the decadence
Dancing to the decadence dance, dance, dance
It's hard to stop once the music gets started
Till the soles of your feet harden up like your heart did 
Stepping in line with the sign of the timer
Seduced by the tune of the decadent dancer
Wooh, the decadent dancer
Just buy a brand new pair of Fred Astaire shoes
Climbing to the top, never gonna stop
It's the same old song, and one, two, three
And dec-a-dance
(Dance) Dance
(Dance) Dance
(Dancing to the decadence dance) Dance
Everybody decadancing
Dancing to the decadence
Dancing to the decadence
(Dance) Dance
(Dance) Dance
(Dancing to the decadence dance) Dance
Everybody decadancing
Dancing to the decadence
Dancing to the decadence dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance
D-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-dance
(Dance)
(Dance)
Dancing to the decadence dance
Everybody decadancing
Dancing to the decadence
Dancing to the decadence dance
(Dance) Dance
(Dancing to the decadence dance) Dance
Everybody decadancing
Dancing to the decadence
Dancing to the decadence dance
Dancing to the decadence dance
