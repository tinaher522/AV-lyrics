<song artist="Extreme" title="Take_Us_Alive">
Your mamma told you, told you to stay away
Pappa done scold you girl, don't hear a word he say
He said, Over my body no star-crossed lover lay
You can run, I can hide
And we'll meet each other on the other side
Don't you worry pretty baby
They'll never take us alive
Tell me you're leaving it, leaving it all behind
Better believe in me, never treat you unkind
(A little closer girl) Come take my hand child
I'll love you for a million miles
You can run, I can hide
And we'll meet each other on the other side
Don't you worry pretty baby
They'll never take us alive
Save our souls, save our souls
Save our souls, save our souls
You better run, I gotta hide
And we'll meet each other on the other side
Don't you worry pretty baby
They'll never take us alive
You better run, and I can hide
And we'll meet each other on the other side
Don't you worry pretty baby
They'll never take us
Don't you worry pretty mamma
They'll never break us
Don't you worry pretty baby
They'll never take us alive
