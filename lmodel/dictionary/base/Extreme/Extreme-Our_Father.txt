<song artist="Extreme" title="Our_Father">
Oh Daddy please
Take me with you, where you going
Oh Daddy please
Come find the time, come watch us growing
Oh Daddy please
Don't leave, there's so much that we want to know 
Before you go
 
I'm in need of someone to tie my shoe
Or take hold of my hand when I become afraid
And whose footsteps will I follow into
Daddy please, don't run away
 
Our father
Far father
Our Father
Far father away
 
Oh Daddy please
I pray every night the doors will open
Oh Daddy please
This house is just a broken home, left all alone
I'm in need of someone to tie my shoe (Oh)
Or take hold of my hand when I become afraid (Ah)
And whose footsteps will I follow into
Daddy please,don't run away
Our father
Far father
Well,l et me tell you about our father
Far father away
A-daddy don't
A-daddy don't run away
Yeah!
(SOLO)
Yeah!
Whose footsteps will I follow into
Daddy please, don't run away
Our father
Far Father
Well, let's talk about our father
Yeah, yeah
Far father
You know I'm talking about our father
Far father away
Our father!
