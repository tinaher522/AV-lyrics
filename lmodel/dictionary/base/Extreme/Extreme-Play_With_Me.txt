<song artist="Extreme" title="Play_With_Me">
Do you want to play?
Ring around the rosie
Hopscotch, Monopoly
Red light, green light
G.I. Joes and Barbies
Hide and seek, kick the can
Cowboys and Indians
Wiffle ball, paper dolls
Hacky sack and hangman
Do you wanna play with me?
Tag you're it, cops and robbers
Jungle gym, chutes and ladders
Tic tac toe, Mister Rogers
Marco Polo, London bridges
Simon Says, steal the bacon
Time out,trick or treat
Electric company
Olly olly oxen free
Do you wanna play with me?
With me
Do you, do you, wanna, wanna, play?
Play with me (play with me)
Do you, do you, wanna, wanna, play?
Play with me (play with me)
Spin the bottle, post office
Kiss and tell, dressin' up
Playin' doctor, peek-a-boo
Two hand touch, cooties
Little League,Looney Tunes
Scissors, rock, paper, zoom!
Kick ball, stick ball
Kill the guy with the ball
Do you wanna play with me?
Buckin' up, recess
Jump rope, relieveo
See saw, sand box
Matchbox, cheerios
ABC's, spelling bees
Sesame Street, hockey
Duck duck duck duck duck duck goose
Do you wanna play with me?
Do you wanna play with me?
With me
Do you, do you, wanna, wanna, play
Play with me (play with me)
Do you, do you, wanna, wanna, play
Play with me (play with me)
Jack and Suzi sittin' in a tree
K-I-S-S-I-N-G
First comes love, then comes marriage
Then comes Adam in a baby carriage
Do you, do you, wanna, wanna, play
Play with me (play with me)
Do you, do you, wanna, wanna, play
Play with me (play with me)
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
