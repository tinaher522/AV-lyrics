<song artist="Extreme" title="Big_Boys_Don't_Cry">
A-d-do-do-d-do
Whoever said that big boys don't cry, yeah
You say you never shed a tear
Well listen, that's a lie
We're all defenseless when it comes to pain
I said boys and girls alike, yeah
We're all the same
It's my party
I'll cry if I want to
(Big boys don't cry)
As if nothing seems to matter
(Big boys don't cry)
Oh, yeah, well then why do I
(Big boys don't cry)
Because nothing in this world ever matters
(Big boys don't cry)
Hey, I'm not ashamed to say a tear is in my eye
Because another tear will take its place
Before I die
(It's my party) it's my party, yeah
I'll cry, I'll cry if I want to
(Big boys don't cry)
As if nothing seems to matter
(Big boys don't cry)
Oh yeah, well then why do I
(Big boys don't cry)
Because bothing in this world ever matters
(Big boys don't cry) Zoom
Yeah
A-come on
Big boys
(Big boys don't cry) 
As if nothing seems to matter
(Big boys don't cry)
Oh yeah, then why do I
(Big boys don't cry)
Because nothing in this world ever matters
(Big boys don't cry)
(Big boys don't cry)
This won't ever matter
As if nothing seems to matter
(Big boys don't cry)
Oh yeah, then why do I
(Big boys don't cry)
Because nothing in this world ever matters
(Big boys don't cry) Aah
