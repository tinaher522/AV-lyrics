<song artist="Extreme" title="Star">
Star, you're a star
Yeah, be careful what you're wishin' for
All your dreams comin' true
Star, yes you are
You're now bigger than venus and mars
You can run but you can't hide
Son you're gonna make it, chance you're gonna take it
Tinsel town callin' your name
Penny in your pocket, walkin' like a prophet
A fortune teller claimin' your fame
Arrivin' in style on the red carpet mile
To the left, to the right step aside
As you wave to the crowd a voice cries out loud
Look at you, you're the new overnight sensation
Star, you're a star
Yeah, be careful what you're wishin' for
All your dreams comin' true
Star, yes you are
You're now bigger than venus and mars
You can run but you can't hide
Love and hate related, privacy invaded
A paparazzi's public domain
Dirty little secret yeah, she couldn't keep it
At least you made it on the front page
Tabloids be told all that glitters ain't gold
Not a muse, drug abuse suicide
As you're left all alone after sellin' your soul
In the aisle smile ready for your close up
Star, you're a star
Yeah, be careful what you're wishin' for
All your dreams comin' true
Star, yes you are
You're now bigger than venus and mars
You can run but you can't hide
Stars in your eyes
Got your piece of the pie in the sky
Don't look down as you hang on
Star, you're a star
Yeah, be careful what you're wishin' for
All your dreams comin' true
Star, yes you are
You're now bigger than venus and mars
You can run but you can't hide
Stars in your eyes
Got your piece of the pie in the sky
Don't look down as you're hangin' on
Hangin' on (For your life)
For your life
You're better off dead than alive
(You're better off dead than alive)
Then they'll love you forever
