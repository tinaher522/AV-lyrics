<song artist="Extreme" title="When_I'm_President">
I remember it well, I was just about three
My dad said, "Son, what do you want to be?"
It didn't ring no bells, but I said "Daddy,
I'm a bit too young, what do you want from me?"
I'm much older now, I'm almost a man
I can do anything, you bet I can
Raise a family, now wouldn't that be grand?
So sorry, but I got bigger plans
You can be anything in the world today
Something like a preacher, a teacher, a baseball player
Those kind of things I just don't care
I want to represent the USA
(The American Dream)
Oh, as far as the eye oh say can you see
(I want to be)
I want to be the leader of the country
(When I'm President)
Things will be different
We'll start a new government
When I'm President
(When I'm President)
Say, you can be in my cabinet
I'll be your heaven sent
President
First things first, we're gonna change the rules
Better listen up, all you boys and girls
Your prez says there'll be no after school
So vote for me, now wouldn't that be cool
(Yeah) yeah
(Yeah) yeah
Now I know there's trouble in the Middle East
I'll spend all the money when I stop the arms race
On my brothers in the desert gonna have themselves a feast
When that's done, then we'll start on world peace
(So go ask Alice)
Oh, you know what he said
(What did he say?)
Remember, "I wanna be elected!"
(When I'm President)
Things will be different
We'll start a new government
When I'm President
(When I'm President)
You can be in my cabinet
I'll be your heaven sent
President, uh
President
President
(When I'm President)
Things will be different
We'll start a new government
When I'm President
(When I'm President)
You can be in my cabinet
I'll be your heaven sent
When I'm President
Things will be different
I'd like a new government
Say, when I'm President
(When I'm President)
Say, you can be in my cabinet
I'll be your heaven sent
President, President
"...Not gonna do it..."
