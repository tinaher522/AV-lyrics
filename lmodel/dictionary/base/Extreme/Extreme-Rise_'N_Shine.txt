<song artist="Extreme" title="Rise_'N_Shine">
Dawn wakes the silence
Of a fainted lullaby
Day breaks the eyelid
From a song sung in my eye
Night rests in peace
As the sun mourns the sky
All's accounted for sheep
Over a horizon's I
 
Rise, rise and shine
A new day is coming
Rise, rise in time
For everything's under the sun
 
And when you see a south wind blow
Forecasting, you will know,
a hot day, will be on the way (Foolish one)
You analyze the earth and the sky
I ask you why you can't analyze the signs,
of the present time
I had a dream
Not unlike the one from old
Of a man king
Whose head was made of gold
Stand castles of sand
Weather the sundials rise 'n fall
Chasing wind through your hands
Till water runs dry the well
 
Dream, Daniel dream
For what's yet to come
See, Daniel see
For everything's under the sun
 
And in the West, a cloud appears
For shadows of a coming shower near, Oh, so near (Hypocrites)
You analyze the earth and the sky
I ask you why you can't analyze the signs
of the present time
 
Vanity
Yes, all is vanity
Vanity
Yes all's futility
 
For one that dies, another's born
Where laughter's heard, comforters mourn
There's a time for everything
A song for love,even abhor
An olive branch,or winter's war
There's a time for everything under the sun
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Under the sun
Rise, rise and shine
A new day is coming
Rise, rise in time
For everything's under the sun
Rise
A new day is coming
Well, there's a time for everything under the sun
You know a time for everything under the sun
Because a new day is gonna be begun, yeah
Sun
