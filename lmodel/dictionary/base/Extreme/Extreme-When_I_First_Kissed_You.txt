<song artist="Extreme" title="When_I_First_Kissed_You">
New York City can be so pretty
From a bird's eye view
Because up there, yeah, that's where
I first kissed you
A modern day romance
A perfect performance
Acting like two fools
Saying silly things
Whisper sweet nothings
Like young lovers only do
I was shaking, you were breathtaking
Like the Empire State
My voice was so far, not quite Sinatra
Singing songs so great
The clock struck one
The night still very young
In the city that never sleeps
Then a whirlwind blew
When I first kissed you
Nearly swept me, swept me off my feet
When I first kissed you
That's when I knew, oh
I was in love
Because up there
Yeah, that's where
I first kissed you
