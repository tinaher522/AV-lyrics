<song artist="Extreme" title="Unconditionally">
So tell me what can I do, ooh
That you couldn't see through
From the very start
There is only one thing
Yet to come from my heart
Loving you unconditionally
Loving you unconditionally
That's what I want to be
What you are to me
Can you see why it's so hard
For me to break apart
From all the things that I hold
Closer to a heart
That has grown far too cold?
Loving you unconditionally
Something new to a heart yet not free
That's what I want to be
What you are to me
And though it seems impossible
When both of my hands are full
That's the only condition
That keeps me from loving you, loving you, loving you
                (SOLO)
Loving you unconditionally
That's what I want to be
Loving you unconditionally
That's what I want to be
Something new
Is what I want to be
It's what you are to me
