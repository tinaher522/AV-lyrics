<song artist="Extreme" title="Am_I_Ever_Gonna_Change?">
I'm tired of being me
And I don't like what I see
(I'm not who I appear to be)
So I start off every day
Down on my knees I will pray
(for a change in any way)
But as the day goes by
I live through another lie
if it's any wonder why!
Am I ever gonna change?
If I say one thing then I do the other
It's the same old song that goes on forever
Am I ever gonna change?
Will I always stay the same?
If I say one thing then I do the other
It's the same old song that goes on forever
Am I ever gonna change?
I'm the only one to blame
When I think I'm right, I wind up wrong
It's a futile fight that's gone on too long
 
Please tell me if it's true
Am I too old to start anew?
(cause that's what I want to do)
But time and time again
Ahen I think I can
(I fall short in the end)
So why do I even try
Will it matter when I die
Can anyone hear my cry?
Am I ever Gonna change?
Will I always stay the same?
If I say one thing then I do the other
It's the same old song that goes on forever
Am I ever gonna change?
I'm the only one to blame
When I think I'm right, I wind up wrong
It's a futile fight that's gone on too long
               (SOLO)
Am I ever gonna change?
Will I always stay the same
If I say one thing then I do the other
It's the same old song that goes on forever
Am I ever gonna change?
I'm the only one to blame
When I think I'm right I wind up wrong
It's a fucking fight that's gone on too long
Am I ever gonna change?
Take it day by day
My will is weak and my flesh too strong
This peace I seek till thy kingdom comes
