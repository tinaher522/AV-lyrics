<song artist="Extreme" title="Christmas_Time_Again">
Christmas always goes too fast 
It's up to us to make it last 
And all I want for Christmas is love...
Come that morning and I see you smile 
It only lasts a little while 
How come we seem to push it all aside?
Don't you know that it's Christmas time again 
I'm happy for you
You know it comes and goes
So let's pretend that it'll last all year
Saint Nick seems to disappear 
He brings us toys but leaves a tear
The day is done, but the spirit should remain... 
It's times like these we need a change 
A calender to rearrange 
I'll make sure it'll last all year 
Don't you know that it's Christmas time again 
I'm happy for you
You know it comes and goes
So let's pretend that it'll last all year
Christmas time again 
I'm happy for you
You know it comes and goes
So let's pretend that it'll last all year
Got to give a little more 
Remember what we're thankful for...
My lord, My God...
Let's pretend just this time 
Let's keep the thought on our minds 
That our Christmases will last all year 
Don't you know that it's Christmas time again 
I'm happy for you
You know it comes and goes, so let's pretend 
That it'll last all year
Christmas time again 
I'm happy for you
You know it comes and goes, so let's pretend 
That it'll last all year
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel 
Born is the king of Israel
