<song artist="Extreme" title="God_Isn't_Dead?">
Ah, look at all the lonely people
Losing faith in a world full of despair
No one who cares
Wondering where God disappeared
 
I see the pain in everybody's faces
Asking why
The God up in the sky didn't say goodbye
Please tell me God didn't die
 
Please tell me God isn't dead
Please tell me God isn't dead
Please tell me God isn't
I wanna know if he's
Please tell me God isn't
Tell me God isn't dead
I want to know
