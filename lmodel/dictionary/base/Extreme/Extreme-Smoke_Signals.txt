<song artist="Extreme" title="Smoke_Signals">
Keep your elbows off the table
Look before you cross
Buckle up your seat belt
Parental discretion advised
Said, keeping off the grass
Beware of the dog
A restricted area
Police will take notice
Oh no, don't wanna know
My ass from my elbow
No, no don't wanna know
I don't wanna know
Don't wanna know
Where there's smoke, there's fire
Don't be playin' ball in the street
Yeah, where there's smoke, there's fire
What you sow is what you will reap
Slippery when wet
Skating on thin ice
Caution, falling rocks
Give a hoot, don't pollute
Well, the Surgeon General's warning
Don't you drink and drive
Saying no to drugs
Hazardous to your health
Out of reach from children
Fatal if you swallow
Keep away from heat
Pull in case of fire
Oh no, I don't wanna know
My ass from my elbow
No no, don't wanna know
I don't wanna know
Where there's smoke, well there's fire
A-d-d-don't be playing ball in the street
Where there's smoke, ooh, there's fire
What you sow is what you will reap
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Where there's smoke, there's fire
D-d-don't be playing ball in the street
Where there's smoke (signals) there's fire (fire)
What you sow is what you will reap
Yeah, yeah, yeah
(Where there's smoke, there's fire)
(Don't be playing ball in the street)
(Where there's smoke, there's fire)
(What you sow is what you will reap)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
