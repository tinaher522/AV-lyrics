<song artist="Extreme" title="Everything_Under_The_Sun:_Who_Cares?">
Tell me, Jesus, are You angry?
One more sheep has just gone astray
A hardening of hearts, turning to stone
Wandering off so far from home
So many children losing time
Walk in darkness, looking for a sign
Chasing their rainbow, future looks bright
Slowly we're losing sight of the light
(Who cares?)
Who cares?
(Who cares?)
Who cares?
(Who cares?)
Who cares?
(Tell me who cares?)
Who cares?
Who cares?
(Who cares?)
Who cares?
(Who cares?)
Who cares?
(Who cares?)
Tell me who cares?
(Who cares?)
All alone, out in the cold
Can't look back, am I growing old?
I chose a path and is this my fate?
Am I finding out the truth too late?
(Who cares?)
Who cares?
(Who cares?)
Who cares?
(Who cares?)
Who cares?
(Tell me who cares?)
Who cares?
Who cares?
(Who cares?)
Who cares?
(Who cares?)
Who cares?
(Who cares?)
Tell me who cares?
(Who cares?)
Here I am, a naked man
Nothing to hide with empty hands
Remember me, well, I am the one
Who lost his way, Your prodigal son
Can anybody, anybody?
Who cares?
(Anybody)
Who cares?
(Anybody)
Who cares?
Am I ever gonna change?
Will I always stay the same?
I say one thing, then I do the other
Same old song goes on forever
Am I gonna change?
(Rise and shine)
I just take it day by day
(New day is coming)
My will is weak but my flesh is strong
I wish I'd see till I give it all
