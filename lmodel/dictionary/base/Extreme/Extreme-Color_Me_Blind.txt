Ah
Color me blind
Color me blind
I had a dream
last night I was blind
And I couldn't see
color of any kind
 
Picture the world minus a rainbow
When day becomes night, then where will the sun go?
Dancing alone, just me and my shadow
Color me blind, so I can see no evil
 
Why do we dream in black and white?
(Color me blind)
Why do we dream in black and white?
(Color me blind)
yeah
 
I had a dream
I was looking over the mountain
But I've, I've yet to see the
the so-called promised land
Picture the world without any color
You couldn't tell one face from the other
I don't understand why we fight with our brother
Color me blind, just to love one another
Why do we dream in black and white?
(Color me blind)
Why do we dream in black and white?
(Color me blind)
Why do we dream in black and white?
(Color me blind)
Why do we dream in black and white?
Color, Color me blind
Color me blind!
                  (SOLO)
Picture the world minus a rainbow
When day becomes night then where will the sun go
Dancing alone,just me and my shadow
Color me blind so I can see no evil
Picture the world without any color
You couldn't tell one face from the other
I don't understand why we fight with our brother
Color...color me blind!
Why do we dream in black and white?
(Color me blind)
Why do we dream in black and white?
(Color me blind)
Why do we
Why do we
Why do we
(Color me blind)
Why do we
Why do we
(Color me blind)
Color me
Color you
Color me blind
Color me
Color you
Color me blind
