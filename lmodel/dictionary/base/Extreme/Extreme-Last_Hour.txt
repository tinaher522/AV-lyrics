<song artist="Extreme" title="Last_Hour">
As stories go, this one's been told
Another heart broken, left out in the cold
With one variation, the difference this time, this one is mine,
Since you've been gone you've stolen my heart
As for the rest of me
I've fallen apart in my desperation
My only prayer: handle with care
Cos I don't know what to do
Wasting my time, wandering through
Wondering why what's it all worth
My last hour on earth
My last hour
So in the end you were the one
Something so right could never be wrong
Without hesitation
I'll tell you the truth: I'm still waiting for you
Cos I don't know what to do
Wasting my time, wandering through
Wondering why what's it all worth
My last hour on earth
My last hour
Cos I don't know what to do
Wasting my time, wandering through
Wondering why what's it all worth
It's worth everything
Yeah my everything is you
It's worth everything
Yeah my everything is you
It's worth everything
Yeah my everything
