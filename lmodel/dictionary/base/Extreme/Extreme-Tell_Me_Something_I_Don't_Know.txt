<song artist="Extreme" title="Tell_Me_Something_I_Don't_Know">
Sun going up, making it's rounds
It keeps on moving, painting the town
Before you know it, she's sinking low
So tell me something, something I don't already know
I don't know
Toward the south, then turning north
Whirlwind spinning on a circular course
The answer my friend returns to blow
So tell me something, something I don't already know
I don't know
Ooh, tell me something I don't know
As for the wise men who pursue their knowledge
Same as the fool, same as the fool, free falling
Prey to folly
Can only one fate befall them both?
So tell me something, something I don't already know
I don't know
Ooh, tell me something I don't know
Tell me something I don't know
Tell me
(SOLO)
The answer my friend returns to blow
So tell me something, something I don't already know
I don't know
Ooh, tell me something I don't know
Tell me something I don't know
Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me
Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me
Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me
Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me
