<song artist="Extreme" title="Little_Girls">
It's not fair what they put me through
Please tell me what I'm supposed to do
Why do I get myself in this situation?
There must be some logical
Answers why I rob the cradle
Can this be love or just infatuation?
Oh boy
Little girl come out and play
I got some candy for my baby
It's your sweet sixteenth birthday celebration
Thank heaven for little girls
Who grow up in a most peculiar way
You might think she's too young for me (little girls)
You know, I always say you're as young as you feel (as you feel)
Yeah, I might be crazy 'cause I like them so young (little girls)
But with little girls the best is yet to come come (yet to come)
Some they say I'm too old for her
Old enough to be her father
Incestual blood is thicker than water, huh
Do what's right, not morally wrong
Flesh and blood can only be so strong
And it's my God not yours I'll have to answer
Thank heaven for little girls
Who grow up in a most peculiar way
You might think she's too young for me (little girls)
You know I always say you're as young as you feel (as you feel)
Yeah, I might be crazy 'cause I like them so young (little girls)
But with little girls the best is yet to come come
Come, come, come, come
You might think she's too young for me (little girls)
You know, I always say you're as young as you feel (as you feel)
Yeah, I might be crazy 'cause I like them so young (little girls)
But with little girls the best is yet to come come (yet to come)
Come, come, come, come
You might think she's too young for me (little girls)
You know, I always say you're as young as you feel (as you feel)
Yeah, I might be crazy 'cause I like them so young (little girls)
But with little girls the best is yet to come come
Come, come, come, come
Yeah
Yeah
