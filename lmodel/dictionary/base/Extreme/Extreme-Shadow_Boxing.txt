<song artist="Extreme" title="Shadow_Boxing">
Last round
Looks like I'm in for a fight
Knocked down
There is nowhere left to hide
Stick 'n' move
When I try to run away
Old one-two
I only end up face to face
Mirror mirror
Getting clearer
It's just me and my shadow
Dancing 'round the ring
I try to fight it but then how can I win
When I'm only shadow boxing
Time out
I'm looking for a standing eight
No doubt
Yeah, my inside has come out to play
Bob and weave
It's conscious of my every move
Been deceived
Can no longer ignore the truth
Mirror mirror
Getting clearer
Split decision
Blurs my vision
It's just me and my shadow
Dancing 'round the ring
I try to fight it but then how can I win
When I'm only shadow boxing
When I'm only shadow boxing, yeah, ooh yeah
          (SOLO)
It's just me and my shadow
Dancing 'round the ring
I try to fight it but then how can I win
When I'm only shadow boxing
When I'm only shadow boxing
Yeah, I'm only!
