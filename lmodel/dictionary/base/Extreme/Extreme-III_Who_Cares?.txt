<song artist="Extreme" title="III_Who_Cares?">
Tell me Jesus
Are you angry?
When will she pass
Just got ugly
A harming of hearts turning to stone
Wondering off
So far from home
So many children losing time
Walking in darkness
Looking for our sign
Chasing there rainbow
Future looks bright
Slowly we're lose'n
Savin the light
[Chorus]
Who cares? (Who cares?)
Who cares? (Who cares?)
Who cares? (Who cares?)
Tell me who care? (Who cares?)
Who cares? (Who cares?)
Who cares? (Who cares?)
Who cares? (Who cares?)
Tell me who care? (Who cares?)
All alone
Out in the cold
Can't look back
Am I growin' old
I chose the pain
Is this my thing
Have u found an out
Truth to late
[Chorus]
