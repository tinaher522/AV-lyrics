<song artist="Extreme" title="It_('s_A_Monster)">
Everybody was born in it
Sure as hell gonna die in it
Some people don't give a shit
Whether or not they're full of it
It's on my mind 
Most of the time
That's when you find 
We all go blind
Then it will start 
To get in our hearts
It's gone too far 
That's who we are
It's a monster (we all have within us)
It's a monster (it's a monster) It's a, it's a monster
It's a monster (turns us into sinners)
It's a monster (it's a monster)
It started when I played with it
It turned into a habit
And after that, once you've been bit
Ah, you can't seem to get rid of it
It's on my mind (on my mind)
Most of the time (most of the time)
That's when I find (that's when I find)
We all go blind (we all go blind)
Then it will start 
To get in our hearts
It's gone too far 
That's who we are
It's a monster (we all have within us)
It's a monster (it's a monster) It's a, it's a monster
It's a monster (turns us into sinners)
It's a monster (it's a monster) It's a, ow ow ow
It's a monster (we all have within us)
It's a monster (it's a monster) It's a, it's a monster
It's a monster (turns us into sinners)
It's a monster (it's a monster) It's a, it's a, ow
Uh, uh, ah-choo
Everybody was born in it
Sure as hell gonna die in it
Some people don't give a shit
It's a monster (we all have within us)
It's a monster (it's a monster) It's a, it's a monster
It's a monster (turns us into sinners)
It's a monster (it's a monster) It's a, it's a
It's a monster (we all have within us)
It's a monster (it's a monster) It's a, it's a monster
It's a monster (turns us into sinners)
It's a monster (it's a monster) It's a, it's a, ah ah ow
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yow
