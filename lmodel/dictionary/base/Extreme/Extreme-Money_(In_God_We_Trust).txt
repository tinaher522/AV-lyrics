(Did you say your prayers?
Don't forget to put your tooth under the pillow.)
Hallelujah
Now I lay, I lay me down to sleep
Hallelujah, almighty dollar
I praise the Lord, afford my roll to keep
Hallelujah, almighty dollar
Money
I need more money
Just a little more money
I said I need more money, yeah, yeah
(Money) Money
(I need more money) I need more money
(Just a little more money) Just a little more money
(I need more money) Yeah, I need more money
And give us these days
Our daily bread
Only you we praise
Almighty dollar
(Money) My personal saviour
(Money) Oh, material lust
(Money) Life's only treasure
(Money) In God we trust
And if I should die before I wake
Hallelujah, almighty dollar
I'm gonna take the money that I make
Hallelujah, almighty dollar

Just a little more money
I said I need more money, yeah yeah
