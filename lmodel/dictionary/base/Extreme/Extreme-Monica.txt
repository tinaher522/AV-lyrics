<song artist="Extreme" title="Monica">
Look at Monica walking in her sleep
Look at Monica running through the fields
In her dream, so serene
Monica, Monica
Hush, don't you say a word
Did you see the smile she made today?
Look at Monica
Look at Monica
Morning's coming ever so fast
Shadow's reality's cast
More like a dream that just won't last
Look at Monica walking in her sleep
Look at Monica running through the fields
In her dream, so serene
Monica, Monica
Please keep quiet, let her sleep
Can't you see the smile she made today?
