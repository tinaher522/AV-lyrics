<song artist="Extreme" title="Leave_Me_Alone">
As for this song
I'll set the mood
There's nothing wrong
Prefer solitude
Alone to think
Of what I don't know
The deeper I sink
The further I'll go
Nothing to fear
No need to hide
I'm already there
Came in from outside
Safe in my nest
My home sweet home
No invited guests
I just love to be alone
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
(I wish you would leave me alone)
(I wish you would leave me alone)
I just want to be alone
It's better this way
No one will get hurt
If you stay away
I won't lose my shirt
If I've become
Too defensive
I'm not the one
You're livin' with
Leave me alone
(I wish you would leave me alone)
(I wish you would leave me alone)
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
(I wish you would leave me alone)
(I wish you would leave me alone)
I just want to be alone
Leave me alone
(I wish you would leave me alone)
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
(I wish you would leave me alone)
(I wish you would leave me alone)
I just want to be alone
Leave me alone!
I want to be
I want to be
I want to be alone
I want to be
I want to be
I want to be
              (SOLO)
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
I just want to be alone
Don't feel sorry
It's not your concern
Only the lonely
Are the ones who get burned
Safe in my nest
My home sweet home
No invited guests
I just want
I just want
I just want to be alone!
(I wish you would leave me alone)
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
(I wish you would leave me alone)
(I wish you would leave me alone)
I just want to be alone
