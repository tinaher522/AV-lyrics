<song artist="Extreme" title="No_Respect">
(Respect) Always everybody looking for some
(Respect) Who do you think you're gonna get it from?
(Respect) Anybody here deserving of none?
(Respect) Tell me what makes you think you're not the one
No respect, no respect none
No respect, no respect none
No respect, no respect none
No respect, no respect none
(Respect) Why be concerned with public adulation?
(Respect) Pat on the back, crying for attention
(Respect) Finding out what it really means to me
(Respect) Honor comes only after humility
No respect, no respect none
No respect, no respect none
No respect, no respect none
No respect, no respect none
           (SOLO)
No respect, no respect none
No respect, no respect none
No respect, no respect none
No respect, no respect none
No respect, no respect none
No respect, no respect none
No respect, no respect none
No respect, no respect none
No respect!!!!!
