"No Women Allowed"
Let me tell you about this love and hate relation
Between a man and a woman
And so none of you all get the wrong interpretation
I can't live with them, gonna die without 'em
Sooner or later
You'll be a He-Man woman hater
It's inevitable
And to become one
You gotta really hate to love them
He-Man woman hater
(He) He man (Man) woman hater
You know I love to hate 'cause I hate to love them
He-Man's behavior doesn't need no explanation
We all got a one track mind
He-Men have always had a sexual preoccupation
It's gonna be your place or it's gonna be mine
Sooner or later
You'll be a He-Man woman hater
It's inevitable, yeah
And to become one
You gotta really hate to love them
He-Man woman hater
(He) He-Man (Man) woman hater
You know I love to hate 'cause I hate to love 'em
(He) He-Man (Man) woman hater
I can't live with 'em, I'm gonna die without 'em
Sooner or later
You'll be a He-Man woman hater
It's inevitable, it's inevitable, yeah yeah
And to become one
You got to really hate to love them
He-Man woman hater
Sooner or later
You'll be a He-Man woman hater
It's inevitable, it's inevitable
Yeah, yeah, He-He-He-Man
And to become one
You gotta really hate to love them
He-Man woman hater
(Hate) woman hater
You know I love to hate, 'cause I hate to love them
(He) He-Man (Man) woman hater
Can't live with 'em, gonna die without 'em
(He) He-Man (Man) woman hater
Can't live with them but I'd love to shoot 'em
Wench, ha, ha, ha
