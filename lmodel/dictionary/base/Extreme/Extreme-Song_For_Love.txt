<song artist="Extreme" title="Song_For_Love">
I lie awake with open eyes
My love just died
I'm cold inside
Can't face the thought to be alone
All by myself, on my own
Love's come and gone
I look around and see the hearts that still are broken
I can't believe all of our hearts remain unopened
Can't go on and on with that same old song
So wipe off the frown and turn around and face each other
Come on, come on
Let's sing a song
A song for you 
a song for me 
a song for love
All for one and one for all together
Singing a song for love
You and I are none without the other
Singing a song for love
You let the time pass by
Big boys don't cry
Believe that lie
(Why do I?)
A broken heart that never mends
Is this the end
Listen my friend
These walls of hate that separate one from the other
Time to rebuild bridges of love, one to another
Come on, come on
Let's sing a song
A song for you 
a song for me 
a song for love
All for one and one for all together
Singing a song for love
You and I are none without the other
Singing a song for love
All for one and one for all together
Singing a song for love
Well, everyone sing along
You and I are none without the other
Singing a song for love
Singing, singing a song
Come on
Yeah, come on
Come on everybody
All for one, one for all
Singing, a-singing a song
You and I, you and I, can love to fly
Singing, singing a song
(All for one) yeah
(One for all)
(You gotta sing, yeah, yeah)
Yeah (Singing a song for love)
