Mutha, don't wanna go to school today
I think I'd rather go outside and play, yeah
They keep calling, asking me
If I'll come in
Is that a sin
If being lazy is the only reason
It's getting late
So, Mutha don't you hesitate
To pack my lunch
And I'll be on my way to school, yeah
Mutha, don't wanna go to school today
I think I'd rather go outside and play, yeah
Mutha, don't wanna go to school today
I think I'd rather go outside and play, yeah
The teacher's always looking down
With her disappointed frown
Asking me to go sleep somewhere else
My levelheaded Mutha
Always said to one another
That the truth will always hurt
If you keep waiting, I said waiting
Mutha, don't wanna go to school today
I think I'd rather go outside and play, yeah
Mutha, don't wanna go to school today
I think I'd rather go outside and play, yeah
Mutha, don't wanna go to school today
I think I'd rather go outside and play, yeah
Come on
Mutha, don't wanna go to school today
I think I'd rather go outside and play
(Mutha,don't wanna go to school today)
(I think I'd rather go outside and play)
I think I'd rather go outside and play
(Mutha, don't wanna go to school today)
I think I'd rather, I think I'd rather
I think I'd rather go outside and play
I think I'd rather go outside and play
Mutha,don't wanna go to school today
I think I'd rather go outside and play
Mutha,don't wanna go to school today
I think I'd rather go outside and play
