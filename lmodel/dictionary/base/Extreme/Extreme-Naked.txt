<song artist="Extreme" title="Naked">
So you want me to take it off
Just to see what's underneath my cloth
I'll show you I'm every inch a man
Measure all that you think you can
Because I'm more than what meets the eye
Flesh and blood is often a white lie
By the cover, you misjudge the book
I said, open your mind and take
Open your mind and take another look
Naked, and I'm unashamed
Naked, with no one to blame
Naked, yeah you want the truth
Naked, here's my birthday suit
Naked
Yeah, I'm naked
I'm naked, naked
Yeah, I'm naked, naked, naked
I pretend to be not anyone
except me and my imperfections
there ain't nothing I'd expect of you
that you wouldn't expect of me
Yeah, you wouldn't expect from me too
Naked, and I'm unashamed
Naked, with no one to blame
Naked, yeah you want the truth
Naked, here's my birthday suit
Naked
Yeah, I'm naked
Yeah, I'm naked, naked
Yeah, I'm naked, naked, naked
Will you excuse me for my ignorance
'Cause I can see only one difference
Those of you who seek to find
While all the others choose to walk and talk blind
               (SOLO)
Naked
Yeah, I'm naked
Yeah, I'm naked, naked
Yeah, I'm naked, naked, naked
