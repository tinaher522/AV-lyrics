<song artist="The_Distillers" title="The_Gallow_Is_God">
Oh, how my heart it sings suicide
Oh, how my gallows sinks of black dye
Oh, how my death march brings a tear to your eye
Oh, how the noose it swings when you die
What a surprise, what is the price
What is the price, what is the price?
What a surprise, what is the price
What is the price, what is the price?
Oh, how my heart it splits when you dumb my eyes
Oh, how my gallows sinks of red dye
Oh, how the noose it smiles when you lie
Oh, how my womb it licks when you dig deep inside
What a surprise, what is the price
What is the price, what is the price?
What a surprise, what is the price
What is the price, what is the price?
Do you do it, oh yeah, do you feel it, oh yeah
Do you sell it, oh yeah, do you need it, oh yeah
In the sun the willows give you shade
How they hang like a guillotine blade in the sun
In the sun the willows give you shade
How they hang like a guillotine blade in the sun
Like a blade
In the sun
Like a blade
What a surprise, what is the price
What is the price, what is the price?
What a surprise, what is the price
What is the price, what is the price?
