<song artist="The_Distillers" title="Beat_Your_Heart__Out">
Baby, you make my heart beat faster
Baby, you make my heart beat faster
I know
Let alone to rust alone
Yeah, you're making me
I had to run, the damage is done
Give it up, yeah, give it up, yeah
There's nothing left, so take the rest
Yeah, you're draining me
I set it light, it burns so bright
Stab it out, yeah
Stab it out, yeah
Baby, you make my heart beat faster
Baby, you make my heart beat faster
I know, yeah I know, I know
I had to run, the damage is done
Give it up, yeah, give it up, yeah
I had to go, it got control
Yeah, you're breaking me
There's nothing left, so take the rest
Stab it out, yeah
Stab it out, yeah
I set it light, it burns so bright
Yeah, you're draining me
You make my heart beat faster
Baby, you make my heart beat faster
I know, yeah I know, that it's true
Let alone to rest alone, oh
Let alone to rest alone, oh
Let alone to rest alone, oh
Baby, you make my heart beat faster
Baby, you make my heart beat faster
Baby, you make my heart beat faster, yeah
There's nothing left, so take the rest
There's nothing left, so take the rest
There's nothing left, so take the rest
There's nothing left, so take the rest
Baby, you make my heart beat faster
Baby, you make my heart beat faster
Baby, you make my heart beat faster
Let alone
