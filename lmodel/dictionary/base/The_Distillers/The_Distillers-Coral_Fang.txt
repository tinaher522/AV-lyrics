<song artist="The_Distillers" title="Coral_Fang">
It's come take from the ripe
It feels so still I could just die just die
It's come to reach up inside
Oh how the blood stains well on white
Ooh the coral fang sinking in to make you well
Ooh the coral fang sinking in to make you ill
It's come to rape what you hide
It fills the years with reprise, disgust, disguise
i'll burn my own funeral pyre
And from your mouth I will rise out rise out
Ooh the coral fang sinking in to make you well
Ooh the coral fang sinking in to make you ill
When the fang sinks down in
Makes your eyes white and roll right into him
When the coral shaves the skin
Disease is cheap scars are polished clean
Ooh the coral fang sinking in to make you well
Ooh the coral fang sinking to take at will
