<song artist="The_Distillers" title="Distilla_Truant">
i dont know why ya come here
i dont know what you want from me
everybody says you use me
oh why did you take that
oh why did you make me
im the one whos suffering, for you
yeah what do you think
i bet you would die for your country
sit here and bleed
oh she fell, i hate you
why?
