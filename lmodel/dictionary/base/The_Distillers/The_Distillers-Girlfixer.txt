<song artist="The_Distillers" title="Girlfixer">
No More Coquettish Look On Your Face
Not So Much Pretty Ugly But Your In Your Place
Hide Behind Your Man, Don't Dare To Think For You
Keep Your Claws Off Me As I Walk On Through,
Walk On Through Don't You Glare
I'm Not The Kind Of Girl Who Would Just Pull On Your Hair
I Won't Be Through 'Til Your Blue
Just Us Two, Whatcha Gonna Do?
(Chorus)
Damn Man Come On And Sell Your Seconds
No One Can Make Ya Make Ya Break Ya
Anyway, Anyway, Anyway I'll Make Ya, They'll Crown Me
Never Used To Harm No One No Matter What The Reason
Now You Dug Your Grave And It's Bitch Hunting Season
Smiling Madly Honey When I See Your Around
Biding My Time Before I Get You On The Ground
Its Not My Plan To Steal Your Man
Its A Pitiful Sight Thats Hard To Stand
I Guess I Don't Get A Clue
So Just Move Your Ass Aside And Let Me Walk On Fucking Through
Damn Man Come On And Sell Your Seconds
No One Can Make Ya Make Ya Break Ya
Anyway, Anyway, Anyway I'll Make Ya, They'll Crown Me
