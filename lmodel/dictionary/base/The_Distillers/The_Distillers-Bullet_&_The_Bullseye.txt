<song artist="The_Distillers" title="Bullet_&_The_Bullseye">
1, 2, 3
I am the bullet and you are the bullseye
And when I hit, there's nothing left
I am the bullet and you are the bullseye
and when I hit, there's nothing left
I've been living in a boundaryless land
I was blind but now i've got my sight back
You suffer insidiously I fucking hate you
Stay the fuck away from me
I am the bullet, you are the bullseye
And when I hit, there's nothing left
I am the bullet, you are the bullseye
And when I hit, when I hit there's nothing left
You're a thief, a liar, and a cheat too
Ain't no mystery to unlocking you
You think i'm a sucker, oh you're fucking sick
The only thing I suck is my man's dick
I am the bullet, you are the bullseye
And when I hit, there's nothing left
I am the bullet, you are the bullseye
And when I hit, when I hit there's nothing left
