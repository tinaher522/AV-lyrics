<song artist="The_Distillers" title="Lordy_Lordy">
Oh lordy lordy
Well your head hangs below the ground
Oh lordy lordy
Well I think thats where your found
And so they tell me that you ain't my friend
I'm a loss to yourself I'll assure your again
When you cry me some real tears
I'll be on the run
You come near me now girl
I'll go get me a gun
Ive never been to prison
I don't know why
I stared death down in its chambers baby
Eye to eye
If prison is a cell then it's raging in my blood
This is a song from the heart ain't nothing else
