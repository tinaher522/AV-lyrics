<song artist="The_Distillers" title="Young_Crazed_Peeling">
Are you ready to be liberated
On this sad side city street
Well the birds have been freed from their cages
I got freedom and my youth
My name is Brody I'm from Melbourne
Fitzroy Melbourne Fitzroy Melbourne
I grew up on Bell St. then on Bennett St.
My mom kicked out my dad for battery
Found a way found a way 
She found a way out of spiritual penury
Working single mother in an urban struggle 
Blames herself now cause I grew up troubled
It hit me I got everything I need
It hit me I got everything I need
My one heart felt too much from the start
Ive seen people come and go
Living large and living low
You can build up your walls sitting on death row
Let the curtain fall on your murdered soul
You can wash it all down swallow your story
Get smacked off your head go down in drumroll glory
You wont solve it committing self inflicted crime
Go on pull the trigger this will be the last time
It hit me, I've got everything I need
It hit me, I've got everything I need
so.
I speak of the truth the truth of the heart
Like a desperate thirst in a raging drought
Hey you time flies by
Theres an everlasting battle for eternal life
I love a man from California 
Hes the prettiest thing we got the same disorder
Way you feel is OK its never gonna change anyway
It hit me, I got everything what I need 
It hit me, I got everything what I need
Are you ready to be liberated
On this sad side city street
Well the birds have been freed from their cages
I got freedom and my youth
yea I got freedom and my youth
