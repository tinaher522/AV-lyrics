<song artist="The_Distillers" title="Black_Heart">
The one time
You lied
You were high, so high
My life in my time
You walk black lines
Hey clean your mess 
Hey you're a mess
The one time 
I lied .. all the time
My life and in my time
You walk black lines
Hey don't I need this
Hey don't I need this
Fuck
