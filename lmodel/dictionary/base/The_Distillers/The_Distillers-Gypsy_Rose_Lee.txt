<song artist="The_Distillers" title="Gypsy_Rose_Lee">
If your sleepy, go to bed and read them tomorrow
If you have a few minutes read it
Now [unverified] I was just listening to this song
And I immediately thought of you my love
When I see you lay down
Under pink lacquered skies
Baby I'll give you something
I'll shut your eyes to this mess
When I love you baby
I mean it more than just the whole world
And when I take a picture thats instant
It gets lost tonight, oh baby it burns
I said I remember it so I saw your eyes
Go through the tunnel and I remember
Australian sun I was eight years old
You were Marilyn Monroe oh, gotta
Take it oh, yeah take it on playing backyard
Blues, black tart in their jaw
I can nail, I'll nail this on
Oh, she ate the whole world
Oh, I've tasted I tasted too too many nights
Lost in space I remember kneeling down
My knees caught in the ground
When I love you baby
I mean it more than just the whole world
And when I take a picture thats instant
It gets lost tonight, oh baby it burns
When I love you baby
Gypsy rose she rose to me
I remember a rolling stone
Rolling on down through the bones
Oh, ya gotta save you gotta save your soul well
She hates the whole world
When I love you baby
I mean it more than just the whole world
And when I saw gypsy rose gypsy rose she rose to me
And when I love you baby
I mean it more than just the whole world
I know your sin, I know sin, sin, sin, you've got wings
