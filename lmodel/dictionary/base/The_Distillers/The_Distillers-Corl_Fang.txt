<song artist="The_Distillers" title="Corl_Fang">
it's come to take from the ripe
it feels so still i could just die
it's come to reach up inside
oh how the blood stains well on white
ooh the coral fang sinking in to make you well
ooh the coral fang sinking in to make you ill
it comes to rape what you hide
it fills the years with reprise, disgust, disguise
i'll burn my own funeral pyre
and from your mouth i will rise~
ooh the coral fang sinking in to make you well
ooh the coral fang sinking in to make you ill
when the fang sinks down in
makes your eyes red and roll right into him
when the coral staves the skin
disease is cheap scars are polished clean
ooh the coral fang sinking in will make you well
ooh the coral fang sinking in to take at will
