<song artist="The_Distillers" title="I_Am_A_Revenant">
Another year has passed and I'm all right
I lick the salt from my wounds and run into the night
Well it's unknown why collusion goes on
It rapes like betrayal
And I'm rotting in the squalor of some
Do you remember the rage?
I remember the hate 
I remember it rained for years
And the blood had left a stain
You say I got karma to collect
I dig my grave and
I'm here waiting for some kind of check
If I get one I'll hold my breath
I racked my spine
It takes a year of you to warrant a test
As the years go by I won't cry
It's the year you walked into my life
I will despise
We are the revenants
And we will rise up from the dead
We become the living 
We've come back to reclaim our stolen breath
