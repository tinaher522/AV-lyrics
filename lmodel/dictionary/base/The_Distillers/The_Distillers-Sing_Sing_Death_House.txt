<song artist="The_Distillers" title="Sing_Sing_Death_House">
I am a death house haunted mirror
Acerbic heart ain't nothing pure in here
I keep the memories of a broken you
Sing, sing the stories of a fractured few
I believe, I will open up
For all my rage will surely come undone
Sing, sing death house
I am agnostic but I hang on a cross
Faithless, saintless, my sin stabs
I wear the crown of oblivion
Rule and aching void watch my sun burn out
I am a death house haunted mirror
Acerbic heart ain't nothing pure in here
You close the door, I sing pleading
Save me before you leave, you're leaving
Sing, sing death house
Sing, sing death house
