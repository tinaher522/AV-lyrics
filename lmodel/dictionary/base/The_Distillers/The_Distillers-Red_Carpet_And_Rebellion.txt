Red carpet and rebellion
Makes ya wonder at these established ones
They ain't out to get ya
'Cause your a mile away
I heard a siren, a city warning, they said a new
Dawn arrives in the morning so I wait out tonight
For the, the new sunrise, they laid me to rest with an an aberration
I woke up the living dead colossally mistaken
I ran through the streets and I broke down
There ain't no money there ain't no time
Yeah, I'm outta my mind don't wanna waste this away
I feel ashamed when I am and shamed when I'm not
The configuration of the American dream
The palace dialed in the streets were burning
The red horizon came crashing through the morning
There was no contentment only blood shed
Red blood and social discontent bruised by puritan
Oh, puritan exempt it's like a peasant uprising
St. Petersburg, 1905
Father Garpan led the protest up inside up inside
We are gone we are gone we are gone
I'll run a mile till I find a hung jury
Where there is red carpet there is rebellion
Red carpet and rebellion
Makes ya wonder why they smell so bad
They ain't out to get ya 'cause you're a mile away
