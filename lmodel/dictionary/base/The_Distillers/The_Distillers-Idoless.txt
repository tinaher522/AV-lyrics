<song artist="The_Distillers" title="Idoless">
i dont know but i know it
you better find out what your place is
urban plight is in the city streets
its infectious and its complacent
idoless
over expression and rationed, assimilated temptation
integrity- integrate...integregation
molestedm accosted, detested
ill wreck this coming down like the apocalypse
idoless..syndication
i dont know but i know it
you better find out what your name is
arrested, infested, its your collective
coming off like you wrote the ten commandments
idoless
i dont know but i know it
you better find out what your place is
urban plight is in the city streets
its infectious and you are complacent
idoless
the idol is within you
watch it come on through
the idol is within you
watch it come on through
