This is the story about a circle of women
LA women
On an LA mission
This is the glory gonna get their hooks in gonna drag you way down
Do ya wanna go home soon?
yeah god almighty what the fuck happened to you?
I'm not red, white, and blue
Outta mind your outta sight
Every day and all night
I watch your pale ass on that street, I watch you walk on through
Then she went glassy a sawn-off tragedy
A deliverence in the city, a new beginning
Power and glory in the name of the enemy
You sell your restless casualty for power and glory
Yeah god almighty what the fuck happened to you
I'm not red white and blue 
Outta mind your outta sight
Every day and all night
I watch your pale ass on that street 
Why'd you you walk on through
Hey, yeah yeah yeah, no hey, yeah, hey, yeah yeah yeah, baby
Do I miss you, do I miss you?
Miss you at all
Do I miss you, do I miss you?
I don't miss you at all
and I say god almighty what the fuck happened to you
I'm not red white and blue 
Outta mind your outta sight
Every day and all night
I watch your pale ass on that street 
Why'd you you walk on through this hate, why'd you you walk on through
Hey, yeah yeah yeah, no hey, yeah, hey
