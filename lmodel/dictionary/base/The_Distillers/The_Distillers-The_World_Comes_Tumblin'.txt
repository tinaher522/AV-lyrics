<song artist="The_Distillers" title="The_World_Comes_Tumblin'">
Start a riot, slash your wrists red You want an anwser?
Do you speak delinquently Oh yeah?
there's a message Antagonist You want an anwser?
I bet you killed someone Oh yeah?
Come on I beg you My world comes tumblin' down I paid the price Heartache
I'm not sorry I fell in love with you in NYC Uhuh She ran away
Her mamma never loved her Pill popping pitty She is sick in Melbourne city
Oh no, oh yeah Oh where are you gerti rouge
Come on I beg you My world comes tumblin' down
Hey oh baby come on And speak to me
Hey come on Uhoh you are fucking bored
Are you You are fucking bored You're just bored
