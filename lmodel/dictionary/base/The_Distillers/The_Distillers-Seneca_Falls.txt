<song artist="The_Distillers" title="Seneca_Falls">
Oh it's set in 1848, 
in the crush of New York state,
and the thing about destiny is it never ever makes mistakes
Susan B. Anthony 
Forever haunting me.
Owned, raped, sold, thrown,
A woman was never her own
They cried freedom rise up for me!
I want I want I want freedom
Oh it's set in 1848,
in the crush of New York state,
and the thing about destiny is it never ever sets you free
Elizabeth Cady 
Forever reminding me
I don't steal the air I breathe
Freedom rise up for me.
