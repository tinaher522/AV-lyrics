<song artist="The_Distillers" title="Drain_The_Blood">
I'm living on shattered faith
The kind that likes to restrict your breath
Never been a better time than this
To suffocate on eternal bliss
In a city that swells with so much hate
You seem to rise above and take its place
The heart pumps until it dies
Drain the blood, the heart is wise
All my friends are murder
All my bones no marrows in
All these fiends want teenage meat
All my friends are murderers
Away
I never met a pearl quite like you
Who could shimmer and rot at the same time through
There's never been a better time than this
To bite the hand of a frost bitten eminence
All my friends are murder
All my bones no marrows in
All these fiends want teenage meat
All my friends are murderers
Away, away
Away
I'm alive in uterine
A stab in the dark, a new day has dawned
Open up and let it flow
I'll make it yours, so here we go
All my friends are murder
All my bones no marrows in
All these fiends want teenage meat
All my friends are murderers
He's gone away, he's gone away
He's gone away, he's gone away
He's gone away, he's gone away
He's gone away, he's gone away
He's gone away, he's gone away
He's gone away, he's gone a, he's gone away
