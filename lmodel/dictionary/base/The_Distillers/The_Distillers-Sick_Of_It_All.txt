<song artist="The_Distillers" title="Sick_Of_It_All">
Murder murder a ripe blood stain
Pulled the fucking trigger cause I'm sick of it all
Murder murder a ripe fucking hate
Pulled the fucking trigger cause I'm sick of it all
I went to school today with an UZI
There's this kid he teased me so I shot 'em in the face
All the worlds light won't ease my pain
It won't cease im diseased will you hang me please
I'm a nihilist raised on violence
What do I do I'm American youth
All my life I've lived in silence
I'm gonna snap ill get you back
I'm a girl I'm only 13 my body rots
Cause I won't fucking eat
I'm a silent star on a b-roll
I'm a mirror fucking image of no control
Give me the award I conquered food again
What else is better in life than to purge my pain
If i cut, I won't look like that
If I cut if I cut I won't feel like this shit
We are kids, we think life is a scam
We come from wasted land
We are kids, we play punk rock and roll
If we didn't we got no soul
We are different kids with the same heartbeat
We got one pulse running through the streets
They are our arteries 
I am part of this
