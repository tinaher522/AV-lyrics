<song artist="The_Distillers" title="You're_Gonna_Miss_Me">
You're gonna wake up one morning as the sun greets the dawn.
You're gonna wake up one morning as the sun greets the dawn.
You're gonna look around in your town, to know, to find that
I'm gone.
You didn't realize,
You didn't realize,
You didn't realize,
You didn't realize,
You didn't realize.
How you're gonna miss me, baby.
How you're gonna miss me, baby.
You're gonna miss me, child, yeah, yeah.
I gave you the warning,
But you never heeded it.
How can you say you miss my lovin,
When you never needed it?
Yeah, Yeah, yeah, yeah,
You're gonna wake up wonderin',
Find yourself all alone,
But what's gonna stop you, baby?
I'm not comin' home.
I'm not comin' home.
I'm not comin' home.
Now you know
How you're gonna miss me, baby.
And you're gonna miss me, child.
Yeah you're gonna miss me, baby.
You're gonna wake up one morning as the sun greets the dawn.
You're gonna wake up one morning as the sun greets the dawn.
Yeah you're gonna miss me, baby.
You're gonna miss me, child.
