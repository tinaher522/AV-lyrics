<song artist="The_Distillers" title="For_Tonight_You're_Only_Here_To_Know">
I really want you to sigh
Never in tune, sigh
I really want you to sigh
Never in tune, sigh
Just tonight I would
I would lay here for you
Just tonight I would
I would sink here for you
Just tonight I would
I would slum here for you
Just tonight I would
I would die
I really want you to sigh
Never in tune, sigh
I really want you to sigh
Never in tune, sigh
Where am, am I, in the hallway small
There's a red light and a black sore
Away I say, away I say
Away I say, away
You'll follow me till the end, till the end
You'll swallow me till there is nothing left
You'll follow me till the end, till the end
You'll swallow me till there's nothing left
I really want you to sigh
Never in tune, sigh
I really want you to sigh
Never in tune, sigh
