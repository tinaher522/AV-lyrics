<song artist="The_Distillers" title="Ripley_And_Scuff">
R I P to the LEY
Its Ripley and Scuuuuuuuuffff
(messin about)
Messin about all day and night
Its Ripley and Scuuuuuuuf
Driving in our jet car
Were on our way to you
Seeing smiling faces
Were going to your school...
We are Ripley and Scuff
Strid and bargie too
OOhh yeah
Everybody says were TOP BANANA
Everybody says were silly spoons
When we go to sleep were SNUGARAMA
Were rocking Were rolling Were ripleys rascals...
R I P to the LEY its Ripley and scuuuuffff
(messin about)
Messin about all day and night
Its ripley Scuuuuuuuf
ONE TWO THREE FOUR
(messin about messin about)
ONE TWO THREE FOUR
(messin about messin about)
Ripleys Rascals.................
