<song artist="The_Distillers" title="Colossus_U.S.A.">
Whatcha live for when you noone
What ya do and where ya come from
You call i feel a lack of grace
A certain disconnection
Dissipated understanding
Seems like second slitting
Seems like second slitting
In a third world company
I know what you wanted
I know that you want it, want it
Well hell yeah
Don't walk away
Don't walk away
Don't walk away
Shit
I met a man on the street
He said this is poverty
Down-town on broadway st.
I don't really know his name
He said live in the world not for gain
I know what you want, hey
I know that you want it, want it
I know what you wanted
I know that you want it...
