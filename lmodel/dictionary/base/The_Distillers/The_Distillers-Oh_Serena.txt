<song artist="The_Distillers" title="Oh_Serena">
oh serena. i know what theyre saying about you.
they all say its a resistance.
they all say that ya didnt listen.
well they all have scars on their eyes, its true.
night and day is like a haunted replay.
i know it girl ill pray for you 
just remember its not stronger than you..
oh serena. i know what theyre saying about you.
you tasted death, but, ill shed the night, night irreverant all
the time, carneleby is a bit of you.
time to feel it, time to fix it. time to lure it, oh
no time to miss it, time to lure this stone cold
weather, time alone and time away, i know what they say..
oh serena. i know what theyre saying about you.
i know the pains inside you
i know what theyre saying about you
..its not true..
