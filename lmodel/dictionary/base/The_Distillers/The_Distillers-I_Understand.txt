<song artist="The_Distillers" title="I_Understand">
I'm on the edge everyday
Ain't nothing going for you and me
I am my enemy in every way
He planted the seed
When i was a teen girl i walked real awkward
Like a dog with three legs
I had fought my wars
I was a misshape mistake misfit
Untamed mishap with a junkie heart
Now theres been a shift
I stopped taking hits
My eyes start to flicker flicker
My mouth starts to drip
My heart starts to tinker tinker
What can I do when I'm bound like this with you
Now i really understand I cant feel
I cant feel it i cant feel it
