<song artist="The_Distillers" title="The_Blackest_Years">
Oh Berlin, your heart has been drawn and quartered again.
Oh the East and the West were divided by a wall that staunched their freedom.
Well the wall came down in 1989,
But its ghost still refuses to leave
These hauntings are so reputative,
There's a bit of you in me...
Let's go!
Oh Berlin, your life's on fire,
Burns deep within this heart of mine.
You got astronomical, economical, suffering for a century.
And when the ocean swells that day
I'll get on my ship and I'll sail away
On this ship.
On this ship.
On this ship.
On this ship.
And when you're all alone, don't forget me.
And when I'm all alone, I won't forget you.
And when you're all alone, don't forget me.
Cause I'm on the wrong side of the tracks.
But I did not know until you turned your back.
I'm livin' the blackest years of my life.
But I did not know until you said goodbye..
Goodbye.
Oh Berlin your witness stands here,
On this city-shamed kinda day.
I'm going home, hey.
I'm going home, hey.
I'm going home, hey.
I'm going home, hey.
I'm going home, hey.
And when you're all alone, don't forget me.
And when I'm all alone, I won't forget you.
And when you're all alone, don't forget me.
Cause I'm on the wrong side of the tracks.
But I did not know until you turned your back.
I'm livin' the blackest years of my life.
But I did not know until you said goodbye.
Goodbye!
we were young girls in a small world,
I'm on your doorstep man, 
Ringin' your bell again, I'm ringin' your bell again
I'm sorry Gerite Rouge
