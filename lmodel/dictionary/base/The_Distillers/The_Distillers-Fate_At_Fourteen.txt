<song artist="The_Distillers" title="Fate_At_Fourteen">
They said you'll grow up someday soon enough
The day's gonna come when you put in you'r nine to five
Just like the next man
They said your friends will be fly by night
So decide your fate at fourteen
All of them live someone elts dream to be sold
They all look down their nose on me like I'm below them
All of them said to go nowhere is a disease
So decide you're running out of time
Thats what they always use to say
To me and you
When we dream of a diffrent day
The voices where there to remind us that we're getting old
And our worst fears where right all along
They said you'll grow up someday soon enough
The day's gonna come when you put in your nine to five
Just like the next man
All of them said to go nowhere is a disease
so decide your fate at fourteen
