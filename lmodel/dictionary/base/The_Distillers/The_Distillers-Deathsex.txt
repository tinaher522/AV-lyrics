<song artist="The_Distillers" title="Deathsex">
Shoot your gun
Baby I come undone
I came so hard
I'd do it and do it again
The testament's a bloody knife
The rotting meats the butchers wife
I eat myself stupid
I starve myself smart
I thought she was a crow
'Cause she cried Tomorrow, Tomorrow
</song>
