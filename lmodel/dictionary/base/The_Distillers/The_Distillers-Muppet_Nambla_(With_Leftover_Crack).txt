Why are there so many songs about rainbows? 
And who gives a fuck anyway? 
Rainbows are stupid, they only remind me 
That my life is sick with decay 
And so you are stupid, you choose to believe it 
I know we're all gonna die 
We'll never find it, the rainbow Connection 
The sickly, the worthless, and I 
Who said that "every wish would be heard amd answered 
When wished on the morning star" 
Some asshole thought of it, some sucker believed it 
And look what it's done so far 
And it's so pathetic, that you are pathetic 
And it's all you aspire to be 
You'll never find it, the rainbow connection 
The homeless, the wealthy, and me 
All of us are gonna die 
You could say nature's a facist 
Have you been half asleep and have you heard voices 
Swimming around in your head? 
Some say "I'm lucky!" and some say "I'm Happy!" 
But most say "I'd rather be dead" 
And I know I'm lazy and apathetic 
Sometimes that is all that know 
And I'll never find it, the rainbow connection 
The leftover crizack and you
