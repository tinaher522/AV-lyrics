<song artist="The_Distillers" title="Oldscratch">
heres the chance to express your liberty
noone but you can know what stepping down can mean
despotic leader kills the bravest traitor on the street
but keep the faith they say theyll free us from our pain
they sell you a religious escapade
you join the church and they take your life away
shameless money eat your money eat your vultures quick
but keep the faith, they say theyll free us from our pain
but your liberty is exchanged i said your liberty is exchanged
