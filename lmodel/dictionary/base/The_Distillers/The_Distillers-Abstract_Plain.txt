<song artist="The_Distillers" title="Abstract_Plain">
I've had it with this town
I never saw those shifting skies
I never saw the ground
Or the sunset rise
I want to live on an abstract plain
I'm building a frame
A place to put my ten-yard stare 
Thinking of that paint 
Painted in plein-air 
I want to line on an abstract plain
I need a new adress 
I want some new terrain 
Is it North or South? 
I want to live on an abstract plain 
I could sit on the roof 
On top of that abstract house 
See my abstract view 
An abstract mouse 
I want to live on an abstract plain 
I need a new adress 
Tell my I'm not insane 
Is it up or down? 
I want to live on an abstract plain
