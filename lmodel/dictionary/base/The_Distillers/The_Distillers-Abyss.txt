<song artist="The_Distillers" title="Abyss">
I come down like a hurricane sucked up inside 
And I spit out the suffer, yeah 
You say you want a real revelation, 
Revel in this my lover 
You're free at liberty 
Is this what you want? 
Sometimes I wonder' 
There's a highway to, to the edge, yeah 
Once a night you will drive yourself there 
At the end of the road you will find the answer 
At the end of the road you will drink the fear 
I come down like a bloody rain cuts up flesh sky, 
Pulse beating under, yeah 
Meat petals bloom in a bone garden 
Ain't no god, no ghost gonna save you now 
I sell souls at the side of the road 
Would you like to take a number? 
There's a highway to, to the edge, yeah 
Once a night you will drive yourself there 
At the end of the road you will find the answer 
At the end of the road you will drink the fear 
Take your time, come on, get what you come for don't 
Waste my time, come on, get what you come for don't 
Waste my time, come on, get what you come for don't 
Waste my time, come on, get what you come for 
There's a highway to, to the edge, yeah 
Once a night you will drive yourself there 
At the end of the road you will find the answer 
At the end of the road you will drink abyss
I watched you burn in the eye of my sun, in the eye of my sun, yeah yeah 
I fucked you in, in the eye of my sun, in the eye of my sun, yeah yeah 
I watched you burn in the eye of my sun, in the eye of my sun, yeah yeah 
I fucked you in, in the eye of my sun, in the eye of my sun, yeah yeah 
yeah yeah 
yeah yeah'
