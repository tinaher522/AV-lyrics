<song artist="The_Distillers" title="Dismantle_Me">
I fancy you, but I've been destitute
And all I know dissolved, I could never reundo you
I will always say it's so, I will always speak the truth
Descend into a noose, I could never reundo you
I want to bury you
Yeah, I want to bury you
Vultures circle around, feathers float, wings flap, beats pound
And though my hearts exposed, I could never reundo you
I will always bleed the truth, I will always speak and know
I was sent to cut you loose, I will never reundo you
I want to bury you
Yeah, I want to bury you
I want to bury you
Yeah, I want to bury you
Dismantle me
Yeah, dismantle me
Yeah, dismantle me
And it's warm and humid on Swanson Street
And the air is filled with electricity
And the sky is deeper than a dream
And the sky is deeper than a
Dismantle me (I want to bury you)
Yeah, dismantle me (I want to bury you)
Yeah, dismantle me (I want to bury you)
And the sky is deeper than a dream (I want to bury you)
And the sky is deeper than a dream (I want to bury you)
