<song artist="Shawn_Mendes" title="Act_Like_You_Love_Me">
So you leave tomorrow
Just sleep the night
I promise I will make things right
I'll make you breakfast the way you like
Before you leave tomorrow
Just let me try
Before you leave tomorrow
Before you say goodbye
Before you leave tomorrow
Before you leave
Stay here and lay here right in my arms
It's only a moment before your gone
And I
Am keeping you warm
Just act like you love me so I can go on
And act like you love me so I can go on
Just one more night
Lying in bed
Whether it's wrong or right
Just gotta make sence of it
And you'll be gone in the morning
And you'll be over this
Just one more night so I can forget
Stay here and lay here
Right in my arms
It's only a moment before you're gone
And I am keeping you warm
Just act like you love me so I can go on
When you go
I cant watch you leave
Just promise me you'll sneak out when I'm asleep
And when you go
And you're miles apart
I wake up with shit everything
It's just a dream
Just stay here and lay here right in my arms
It's only a moment before you're gone
And I am keeping you warm
Just act like you love me so I can go on
Stay here and lay here right in my arms
It's only a moment before you're gone
And I
Am keeping you warm
Just act like you love me so I can go on
And act like you love me so I can go on
Just act like you love me so I can go on
