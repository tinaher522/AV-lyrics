<song artist="Shawn_Mendes" title="Memories">
When I wake up to your footsteps
As you get up out of bed
They make a song that sounds so simple
But it dances in my head
A melody so perfect
That it gets me through the day
And the thought of us forever
Is one that won't ever go away
All I need to know is
Where to stop
Take my hand and show me forever
So never will I ever let you go
So let's hold on together
To this paper and this pen
And write down every letter
To every word we've ever said
All I need to know is
Where to stop
Take my hand and show me forever
So never will I ever let you go
Let's write our story
And let's sing a song
Let's hang our pictures on the wall
All these precious moments
That we carved in stone
Are only memories after all
Memories after all
Memories after all
You gave me hope
But I've got to let go
I've got to let go
It's taking it's toll
Deep in my soul
Now I've got to let go
We wrote our story
And we sang our songs
We hung our pictures on the wall
Now those precious moments
That we carved in stone
Are only memories after all
