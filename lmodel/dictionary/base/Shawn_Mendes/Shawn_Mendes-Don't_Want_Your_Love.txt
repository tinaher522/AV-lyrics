<song artist="Shawn_Mendes" title="Don't_Want_Your_Love">
We run about a million miles an hour
And I do my best to try and do it in style
Haven't seen you in a while, girl
Our love is on trial (you run wild, you run wild)
When I call you, you never wanna pick up
'Cause everything that I do is never, ever enough
You only like it when it rains
And when I'm stuck in the mud (you run wild, you run wild, yeah)
Don't want your love, want your love
But I just can't get enough
Don't want your love, want your love
But I just can't get enough
You mess me up
You lay me out on the floor
You mess me up
And still, I come back for more
I don't want your love
I'm not asking for much, I'm just trying to be fair
This road we're on is going nowhere
If we keep on running like a couple of kids
Who just got lost in the woods and now they're losing their wits
I'm overcome with it, this is ridiculous
How everytime we get together, you're the one I miss
I feel powerless and I don't wanna split
You run wild, you run wild!
Don't want your love, want your love
But I just can't get enough
Don't want your love, want your love
But I just can't get enough
You mess me up
You lay me out on the floor
You mess me up
And still, I come back for more
I don't want your love, yeah woah
That's it, it's now or never, I can't do this forever
'Cause all this stormy weather's got me running wild
That's it, it's now or never and I can't do this forever
'Cause all this stormy weather's got me running wild
Don't want your love, want your love
But I just can't get enough
Don't want your love, want your love
But I just can't get enough
You mess me up
You lay me out on the floor
You mess me up
And still, I come back for more
I don't want your love, want your love
But I just can't get enough
Don't want your love, want your love
But I just can't get enough
You mess me up
You lay me out on the floor
You mess me up
And still, I come back for more
I don't want your love
