Shawn:
Never thought that we would end up here
Should've known it from the start
I know you mean it when you say you love me
But we're trying way too hard
Astrid:
Used to think that we would last forever
How could I have been so wrong?
Never thought I'd be the one to say this
What if our time has come and gone?
Both:
You, you don't mean no harm
But you're stringing me along
And I don't have the time to spare
And I, I'm trying hard to breathe
But you're suffocating me
This time I'm coming up for air
Air, air, air, air, air, air
Air, air, air, air, air, air, air
Astrid:
Always trying to put your two cents in
Then expecting me to change
Try to fix me up but I'm not broken
All you do is leave me stained
Shawn:
Told you not to tie me down too quickly
Take it slow, it's not a race
And you keep on trying to reel me in
But all I really need is space
Both:
You, you don't mean no harm
But you're stringing me along
And I don't have the time to spare
And I, I'm trying hard to breathe
But you're suffocating me
This time I'm coming up for air
Air, air, air, air, air, air
Air, air, air, air, air, air, air
Air, air, air, air, air, air
Air, air, air, air, air, air, air
Shawn:
Tried to hold me down
But I'm surfacing
It's hard to let you go
But I gotta leave
Both:
You, you don't mean no harm
But you're stringing me along
And I don't have the time to spare
And I, I'm trying hard to breathe
But you're suffocating me
This time I'm coming up for air
You, you don't mean no harm
But you're stringing me along
And I don't have the time to spare
And I, I'm trying hard to breathe
But you're suffocating me
This time I'm coming up for air
Air, air, air, air, air, air
Air, air, air, air, air, air, air
Air, air, air, air, air, air
Air, air, air, air, air, air, air
