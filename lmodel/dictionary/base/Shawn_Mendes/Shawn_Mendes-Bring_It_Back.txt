<song artist="Shawn_Mendes" title="Bring_It_Back">
Taking it slow isn't easy
If as far as you go 
Is only half as far as you and I both know, yeah
Coming up from above
A little something and it's only because 
I don't ever wanna see you in love, but I know
That you've been coming off strong lately
And I can feel it, that you've been thinking that maybe
You got a, another shot at me 
Thinking possibly somehow, but not now
And it's been spinning around like a hurricane
And the sound of the thunder that's beating my head to the ground
But I, I know
That I can't go back to this, to her
To what we used to have
It's black and burnt
My God, this is so sad
It'll only make things worse if we bring it back
And I mean, if you believe
That there is something still between you and me
Then baby honestly yeah, you're not the one for me
And I can't go back to this, to her
To what we used to have
It's black and burnt
My God, this is so sad
It'll only make things worse if we bring it back
If we bring it back, oh
If we bring it back, oh
If we bring it back
If we bring it back
