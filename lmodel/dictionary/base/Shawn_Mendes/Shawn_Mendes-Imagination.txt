<song artist="Shawn_Mendes" title="Imagination">
Oh, there she goes again
Every morning, it's the same
You walk on by my house
I wanna call out your name
I wanna tell you how beautiful you are
From where I'm standing
You've got me thinking what we could be 'cause
I keep craving, craving you, don't know it but it's true
Can't get my mouth to say the words they wanna say to you
This is typical of love, I can't wait anymore, I won't wait
I need to tell you how I feel when I see us together forever
In my dreams, you're with me
We'll be everything I want us to be
And from there, who knows?
Maybe this will be the night that we kiss for the first time
Or is that just me and my imagination?
We walk, we laugh, we spend our time
Walking by the ocean side
Our hands are gently intertwined
A feeling I just can't describe
And all this time we spent alone
Thinking we could not belong 
To something so damn beautiful, so damn beautiful
I keep craving, craving you, don't know it but it's true
Can't get my mouth to say the words they wanna say to you
This is typical of love, I can't wait anymore, I won't wait
I need to tell you how I feel when I see us together forever
In my dreams, you're with me
We'll be everything I want us to be
And from there, who knows?
Maybe this will be the night that we kiss for the first time
Or is that just me and my imagination?
Imagination
Imagination
In my dreams, you're with me
We'll be everything I want us to be
And from there, who knows?
Maybe this will be the night that we kiss for the first time
Or is that just me and my imagination?
I keep craving, craving you, don't know it but it's true
Can't get my mouth to say the words they wanna say to you
