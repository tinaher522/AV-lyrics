<song artist="Ronan_Keating" title="Close_Your_Eyes">
I've been lost about a hundred million times
I've been searching for some freedom in my mind
Everyday feels like a battle deep inside
Leavin' all the love and innocence behind
If you want something then baby come and get it
I've been lost a million times an I don't regret it
If your colors wanting to shine and just can't speak
Baby I'll be the one to send you right to sleep
When you close your eyes
Is it just another way to feel alive
Everyday is moving like the speed of light
And I'm comin' to the point of no return
Leavin' all the love and innocence to burn
If you want something then baby come and get it
I've been lost a million times an I don't regret it
If your colors wanting to shine and just can't speak
Baby I'll be the one to send you right to sleep
When you close your eyes
When you close your eyes
When you close your eyes
When you close your ey..ey...eyes
Once you've been there
She don't wanna fade
And everybody turns away
There's some light
In the shadow of your mind
And the truth don't wanna slip away
She don't wanna know
Its getting really gold
And I'm tired of livin' all alone
If its time
If its time
If you want something then baby come and get it
I've been lost a million times an I don't regret it
If your colors wanting to shine and just can't speak
Baby I'll be the one to send you right to sleep
When you close your eyes
When you close your eyes
When you close your eyes
When you close your eyes
Your eyes
When you close your eyes
When you close your eyes
When you close your eyes
