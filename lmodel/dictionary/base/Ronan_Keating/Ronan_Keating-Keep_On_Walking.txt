<song artist="Ronan_Keating" title="Keep_On_Walking">
Seems like I was always running,
From someone or something,
So scared what life could hold,
Didn't even want to know,
Each day I'd stand against it,
Put up my defences,
Wouldn't let nobody inside,
Then you walked in my life
Chorus
Your love is all I know
Never let you go,
Baby with you I choose my road,
All my life
Your the reason why
Baby with you I walk that road.
Now nothing can defeat me,
Knowing you completely,
You make me stronger each day,
You lead me all the way,
And Anything that You wanna do
I'll be there beside you
As long as you don't  leave my dreams are guarenteed
Your love is all I know
Never let you go,
Baby with you I choose my road,
All my life
Your the reason why
Baby with you I walk that road.
I'll walk that road
Hand in hand
'Til it stands
nothing can stop me now
Your love is all I know
Never let you go,
Baby with you I choose my road,
All my life
Your the reason why
Baby with you I walk that road.
Never let you go
Baby with you I choose my road,
All my life
Your the reason why
Baby with you I walk that road.
