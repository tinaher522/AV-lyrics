<song artist="Ronan_Keating" title="As_Much_As_I_Can_Give_You_Girl">
I had a bad day and then I heard what you had to say
After I had a hard week it's getting harder to turn the other cheek
It's going to be a tough month without you cause you give me the bump
So this is my last year because without you I don't even care
And you don't know what I've been through
I've tried so hard but how about you?
And here I am trying to save what already died
But as much as I can give you girl
I'm gonna send your way
I need you I can't give up girl
Please don't go away
The day we first met you were innocent and so full of life
You said you'd follow me across this whole earth where are you tonight?
So you go fly while I get sold and you'll go far like we all know
Til one fine day you'll realise what you let die
But still as much as I can give you girl
I'm gonna send your way
I need you I can't give up girl
Please don't go away
I spent my whole life just to find you
And lost it all in just one day so as much as I can give you girl
To not go away
A ghost sings "Oh my darling, how can I get you back in my life
Oh my darling if just for one night I mean life"
But as much as I can give you girl
I'm gonna send your way
I need you I can't give up girl
Please don't go away
I spent my whole life just to find you
I lost it all in just one day
So as much as I can give you girl
To not go away
So as much as I can give you girl
To not go away
To not go away
To not go away
To not go away
To not go away
To not go away
To not go away
