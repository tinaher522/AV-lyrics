<song artist="Ronan_Keating" title="You">
People on planes
People on trains
People in cars and traveling in spaceships
To a trillion stars
A million smiles
A million frowns
There's so many streets and towns
To lose yourself, to find yourself
But I found the answer with you
Cause you, you are my one and only
And you, you were the one that showed me love
Through all of this life's confusion
You are the light that guides my way
Here on the stage
I'm all alone
Singing out loud
Here in the spotlight
Are you there in the crowd?
Well I'm talking to you
And I'm trying to say that I miss you so
Sometimes I loose myself, I find myself
I found the answer with you
Cause you, you are my one and only
And you, you were the one that showed me love
Through all of this life's confusion
You are the light that guides my way (my way)
And I know (and I know)
When I'm next to you
All the crazy noise goes away
When I hold you in my arms, yeah
I can feel the place im coming
I can lie here, I can die here with no regrets no no way
You, you are my one and only
And you, you were the one that showed me love
Through all of this life's confusion
You are the one who guides my way
Cause you, you are my one and only
And you, you were the one that showed me love
Through all of this life's confusion
You are the light that guides my way
And it's you yeah
And it's you yeah
And it's you yeah
Just you fucking me!
