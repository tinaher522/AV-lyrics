<song artist="Ronan_Keating" title="Feel">
Just one more dance
When can we touch? 
I wanna believe so much
That you needed me
We're near the time
Our bodies combine
This touch feels so kind
Could this really be
Woo oooo (4x)
Under the sheets
So close to me
Let's take it one more step
You're all I need
Our lips caress
My hands are all yours
Our bodies they feel so warm
You feel it too
Wooo oooo

I wanna feel the world shake (wooo ooo)
I wanna feel the earth break (wooo ooo)
I wanna feel you everyway (wooo ooo)
I wanna hear your every scream (wooo ooo)
I wanna fill your every dream (wooo ooo)
I wanna drink your wine
With a taste so pure
Your body in in love with mine
Now it's the time
Wooo oooo
I wanna feel the world shake (wooo ooo)
I wanna feel the earth break (wooo ooo)
I wanna feel you everyway (wooo ooo)
I wanna hear your every scream (wooo ooo)
I wanna fill your every dream (wooo ooo)
Tonight is the night
When I take your hand
Tonight I lay you down
All by yourself
