<song artist="Ronan_Keating" title="Lovers_And_Friends">
This is the long love we follow
There in your ancient times
I can see all no tomorrow
There in your ancient past
Many are the nights I lie awake
I listen to, each breath you take
And when your world is cold
And you've got place to go
Look for me
Many are the moments we're apart
I'm half myself, I've got no heart
When my world is cold
And I've got no place to go
Look for me
Dreams can knock before they're born
The truth is on the wind
And while we've got each other souls
We've got everything
Lovers and friends
Taken from high above
I become yours tonight
Tell me it's me you love
Lovers and friends
Bound by each others souls
And I vow to hold you in my hand
And I'll make you understand
And I'll never let you go
Many are the nights I lie alone
I dream of you, I dream of hope
The world gets in the way
And they don't hear a thing you say
Come to me
And here is life and then it's gone 
It's just that way for everyone
The sun will set on our love everyday
Lovers and friends
We've only just begun
As tall as the mountain high
As long as the river runs
Lovers and friends
Bound by each other souls
And I vow to hold you in my hand
And I'll make you understand
I'll never say goodbye
And I'll never let you go
(Heaven angels hard to find, they are of a special kind
Someone playing on your mind, love is never far behind)
Lovers and Friends
Bound by each others souls
And I vow to hold you in my hand
And I'll make you understand
I'll never say goodbye
And I'll never let you go
(Heaven angels hard to find, they are of a special kind
Someone playing on your mind, love is never far behind)
(Heaven angels hard to find) 
Heaven angels hard to find
(They are of a special kind, someone playing on your mind)
Someone's playing on your mind
(Love is never far behind)
Love is never far behind
(Heaven angels hard to find, they are of a special kind
Someone playing on your mind,...)
