<song artist="Ronan_Keating" title="Breathe">
They built these walls around me
So they'd never see me fall
A boy made of stone
I was unbreakable
How was it you found me? 
A broken branch amongst the trees 
Even at my darkest you still wanted me
Lost then found
Now I can breathe
You opened up my eyes I see
You are the everything I need 
All this time I was lost
You finally found me
If I could tell the younger
Naive version of myself
There's nothing I could tell you that you don't know yourself
The wheels are always turning
Hearts are always
Lost or found
Now I can breathe
You opened up my eyes I see
You are the everything I need 
All this time I was lost
You finally found me
Running at the speed of light
Wanted to protect myself and hide away
You helped me to shed the past
Now I don't have to ask if I am lost or found
I've found my ground
Now I can breathe
You opened up my eyes I see
You are the everything I need 
All this time I was lost
You finally found me
Oh you found me
I'm not lost anymore
You finally found me
