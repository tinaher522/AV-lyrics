<song artist="Ronan_Keating" title="Baby_Can_I_Hold_You">
I'm sorry,
It's all that you can say
Years gone by and still
Words don't come easily
Like sorry (like sorry..like sorry..)
Forgive me,
Is all that you can say
Years gone by and still
Words don't come easily
Like forgive me (forgive me...forgive me..)
Forgive me..
But you can say, baby
Baby can I hold you tonight? 
Baby, if I told you the right words
Oooh, at the right time
You'll be mine
I love you
Is all that you can say
Years gone by and still
Words don't come easily (words don't come easily..)
Like I love you, I love you..
But you can say, baby
Baby can I hold you tonight? 
Baby, if I told you the right words
Oooh, at the right time
You'll be mine
(baby can I hold you...)
But you can say, baby
Baby can I hold you tonight? 
Baby, if I told you the right words
Oooh, at the right time
You'll be mine
(baby, if I hold you..)
(baby, can I hold you..) you'll be mine..
(baby if I told you..)
(baby, can I hold you..)
You'll be mine..
(baby if I told you..)
Baby, can I hold you.
