<song artist="Ronan_Keating" title="Solitary_Song">
Baby something's wrong
I don't know where you are
I don't know why you're gone
you don't answer the phone
Lately things have changed
you don't come around
you don't say my name
nothing feels the same, crazy
Come on baby ,
come home save me
this heart is to big alone
come on baby
can't keep playing
this solitary song
Funny can't explain
since you went away
it's a crying shame
but I'll take the blame
just finished this game
can't take the pain, no more
Come on baby,
come home save me
this heart is to big alone
come on baby,
can't keep playing
this solitary song
come on baby,
this bed is to big alone
come on baby,
can't keep playing
the solitary song
Where do I go in the winter time
where do I go when the sun don't shine
and you're on my mind , baby
I can't sleep at night
cos I'm missing you like crazy
Come on baby
come home save me
this heart is to big alone
come home baby
can't keep playing this solitary song
come on baby
can't keep playing this solitary song
this bed is to big alone
come on baby
can't keep playing this solitary song
