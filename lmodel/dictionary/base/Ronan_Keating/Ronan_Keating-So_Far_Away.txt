<song artist="Ronan_Keating" title="So_Far_Away">
There's a land
That gave me life
That made me free
That made me proud
And someday
I will return
Home to the land
Where I'll lay me down
Where is home? I hear you say
So far away, so far away
I hear your voice from afar
It haunts me whenever I stray
But I must follow a star
So far away
So far away
In the song
Upon the breeze
And in the roar
Of rolling waves
Like the roots
Of ancient trees
That run so deep
In the earth I crave
[Chorus]
I hear your voice in my heart
I miss you much more than I can say
But I must follow a star
So far away
So far away
[Maori chant]
Toitu he kianga; whatungarongaro he tangata
(people are transistent things but the land endures)
[Repeat chorus]
