<song artist="Ronan_Keating" title="I_Wouldn't_Change_A_Thing">
You took my body, yeah, yeah
And everything I have,
My heart, my soul, my money
It was so easy.....for you
But how could I refuse when you knew how to use the body
But it gets so hard, when you love someone
but they can't love you,
So you love alone
But I wouldn't change a thing
no, no
If I could do it all again
yeah, yeah
Did it make make me a better man,
I don't know
Cause it made me what I am,
Was that part of your plan
Well I wouldn't change a thing
Ain't it funny, uhm hmm
How easy you can fall when your heart is doing all the talking
And it got so crazy, sometimes
Walking over me, guess it must have seemed so easy
But it gets so hard, when you love someone
but they can't love you,
So you love alone
But I wouldn't change a thing
no, no
If I could do it all again
yeah
Did it make make me a better man
I don't know
Cause it made me what I am
Was that part of your plan
Well I wouldn't change a thing
I won't hold on
I won't hold on
Cause I'm moving on
I'm moving it on
I won't hold on
I won't hold on
Cause I'm moving on
movin', movin', movin', movin', movin'
But I wouldn't change a thing
no, no
If I could do it all again
yeah, yeah
Did it make make me a better man
I don't know
Cause it made me what I am
Was that part of your plan
But I wouldn't change a thing
(I don't wanna change a thing)
no, no
If I could do it all again
(I'd do it all again)
yeah, yeah
Did it make make me a better man
(I don't wanna change a thing)
I don't know
Cause it made me what I am
Was that part of your plan
No I wouldn't change a thing
No I wouldn't change a thing
No I wouldn't change a thing
