<song artist="Ronan_Keating" title="Even_If_I'm_Gone">
Every time I go away
You know I want to stay
I feel like I'm turning to
I try to overcome this pain
There's no easy way
I'm already missing you
As I look out over the northern lights
I can almost feel you here tonight (2x)
Even if I'm gone
And it feels like forever
I pray us soon be home
In your loving arms again
And even if I'm gone
There's a part of you still with me
Close my eyes and I think how beautiful
And I know I'm not alone.

So I'm trying to be strong
I know I carry on
I still feel the emptiness
If only I can find a way
To be together every day and it say
Back to the loneliness
See the full moon shine in the distant sky
I can almost feel you by my side (2x)
See the full moon shine in the distant sky
And I wonder if you can hear me crying
Hear me cry......
Soon be home........
In your loving arms.......
(close my eyes)
