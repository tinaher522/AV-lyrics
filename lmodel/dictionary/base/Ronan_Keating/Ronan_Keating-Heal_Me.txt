<song artist="Ronan_Keating" title="Heal_Me">
Heal me, steal me, feel me, heal me
When things don't turn out right
And it feels like you've lost the fight
When things don't work out quite the way
Friend you can look my way
Oh...let's start thinking with our hearts
Then this world, can make a new start...start
Chorus
Why won't you...heal me
Love won't you...steal me
Into the night...feel me
I believe, I believe, I believe
Heal me
If there's been a change of plans
Someone let go of your hand
When things ain't looking quite the way
You've got a place to stay
Oh...let's start thinking with our hearts
Then this world can make a new start...start
Repeat Chorus
And there ain't no reason for us to lose our faith in this world
If only us people on earth can just change the love will unfurl,
unfurl...funny innit?
Heal me
Love won't you...steal me
Into the night...feel me
I believe, I believe, I believe
Heal me
If they stole your rights
And you're lost in the night
When skies don't look bright
My friend don't lose sight
When you just cannot fight no more
That's when I need you
That's when I really need you
That's when I need you to call me
