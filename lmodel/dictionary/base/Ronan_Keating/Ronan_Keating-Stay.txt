<song artist="Ronan_Keating" title="Stay">
I've been sitting here staring at the clock on the wall
And I've been laying here praying, praying she won't call
It's just another call from home
And you'll get it and be gone and I'll be crying
And I'll be begging you, baby, beg you not to leave
But I'll be left here waiting
With my Heart on my sleeve
Oh, for the next time we'll be here
Seems like a million years and I think I'm dying
What do I have to do to make you see
He can't love you like me?
Why don't you stay, I'm down on my knees
I'm so tired of being lonely
Don't I give you what you need
When he calls you to go
There is one thing you should know
We don't have to live this way
Baby, why don't you stay
I can't take it any longer
But my will is getting stronger
And I think I know just what I have to do
I can't waste another minute
After all that I've put in it
I've given you my best
Why does she get the best of you
So next time you find
You wanna leave her bed for mine
Why don't you stay, I'm up of my knees
I'm so tired of being lonely
You cant give you what I need
When he begs you not to go
There is one thing you should know
I don't have to live this way
Baby, why don't you stay
Baby, why don't you stay
