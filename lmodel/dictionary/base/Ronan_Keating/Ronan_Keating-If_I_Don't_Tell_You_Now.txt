<song artist="Ronan_Keating" title="If_I_Don't_Tell_You_Now">
I've kept it inside for the longest time
And I can't keep keeping in
All this love that's inside my heart
Maybe it's safer not to say that I care
Maybe this road won't lead me anywhere
But if I don't tell you now (If I don't tell you now)
I may never get the chance again (I may never get the chance again)
To tell you that I need you, tell you what I'm feeling
If I keep these feelings in
And if I don't say the words (If I don't say the words)
How will you hear what's inside my heart?
How will you know that, if I don't tell you now, oh
I'd give anything to be in your dreams
And I can't stand standing by
With this dream that's inside my heart
Maybe I'm only going to make a mistake
And there's a chance maybe my heart will break
But if I don't tell you now (If I don't tell you now)
I may never get the chance again (I may never get the chance again)
To tell you that I need you, tell you what I'm feeling
If I keep these feelings in
And if I don't say the words (If I don't say the words)
How will you hear what's inside my heart?
How will you know that, if I don't tell you now
How will you know you're inside my soul
Oh it's driving me crazy
'Cause you don't see (you don't see)
You're the world to me
I'm so afraid to say the way that I feel
But if I don't tell you now (If I don't tell you now)
I may never get the chance again (I may never get the chance again)
To tell you that I need you, tell you what I'm feeling
If I keep these feelings in
And if I don't say the words (If I don't say the words)
How will you hear what's inside my heart?
How will you know that, if I don't tell you now
Oh oh, if I don't tell you now
