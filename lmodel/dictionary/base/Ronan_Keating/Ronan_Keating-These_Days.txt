[Brian:]
These days
I've been feeling lucky
Looking all around me
I see so many dreams
That have come true
Like me right next to you,
Like the angels pulling through
These days have
Only just begun
[Ronan:]
Someone to come home
To each and every night
All of my tomorrow's are
Finally looking bright, over
I won't rush it,
Why would I dare
Nothing could compare
[Both:]
To the way
I've been feeling
[CHORUS:]
These days
They are the best
I've ever had
And they have
Only just begun
Here we are
We're so connected
Like a moon is
To the sun
I never thought
I'd feel this way
'Cause all I ever wanted,
Were these days
[Ronan:]
If I could, I'd try to
Freeze the moment
Set aside the future,
Stay right here,
Right now
Sometime, woah,
Fly like the flame
That never dies
Like the love
That's in your eyes
These days,
Have only just begun
[Brian:]
Something to believe in
When the world
Is going mad
[Ronan:]
When the rain is
Crashing down girl
It doesn't seem so bad
(Doesn't seem so bad)
[Brian:]
I won't rush it
[Ronan:]
No, why would I dare
[Both:]
Nothing could compare
To the way
I've been feeling
[Repeat chorus]
They are the best
I've ever had
And they have
Only just begun
Here we are
We're so connected
Like a moon is
To the sun
[Brian:]
I never thought
I'd feel this
[Ronan:]
I never thought
I'd feel this way, baby
[Brian:]
In fact it happens
When I pray
[Both:]
'Cause all I ever
Really wanted
Were these days
All I ever really wanted
All I ever really wanted
Was
(These days)
