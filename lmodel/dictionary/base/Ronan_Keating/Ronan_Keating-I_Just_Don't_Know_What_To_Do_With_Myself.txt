<song artist="Ronan_Keating" title="I_Just_Don't_Know_What_To_Do_With_Myself">
I just don't know what to do with myself
I just don't know what to do with myself
I'm so used to doing everything with you
Planning everything for two
And now that we're through
I just don't know what to do with my time
I'm so lonesome for you, it's a crime
Going to a movie only makes me sad
Parties make me feel as bad
When I'm not with you, I just don't know what to do
Like a summer rose needs the sun and rain
I need your sweet love to beat all the pain
I just don't know what to do with myself
I just don't know what to do with myself
Baby, if your new love ever turns you down
Come back, I will be around
Just waiting for you, I don't know what else to do
Don't know what else to do
I don't know what else to do
I'm still so crazy for you
Oh, oh, oh
