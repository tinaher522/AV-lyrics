<song artist="Ronan_Keating" title="Give_You_What_You_Want">
Why didn't I call, why didn't I fall
Why didn't I hang my heart on your wall
Why didn't I know, why didn't I show 
All my feelings from the word go
So if you love me don't leave me
I'll promise that you'll never lack
â€˜Cause this man's on his knees begging please
Baby don't turn your back, yeah
I'll give you what you want
I'll do anything to make you mine
If you give me what I want I will be yours till the end of time
Girl you won't be sorry
And you won't regret it
There's no need to worry
Only if you let it
Why didn't I say the things that I read
Why didn't I see the signs in my head
Why didn't I speak to you last week
When I saw you walking down my street
So if you love me don't leave alone into die on this track
Girl rescue me let's get this train
And we'll never look back, yeah
I'll give you what you want
I'll do anything to make you mine
If you give me what I want I will be yours till the end of time
Girl you won't be sorry
And you won't regret it
There's no need to worry
Only if you let it
Oh I can't let go
Oh I swear I'll take it slow
I'll give you what you want
I'll do anything to make you mine
If you give me what I want I will be yours till the end of time
I'll give you what you want
I'll do anything to make you mine
If you give me what I want I will be yours till the end of time
I'll give you what you want
I'll do anything to make you mine
