<song artist="Ronan_Keating" title="When_You_Say_Noting_At_All">
It's amazing how you can speak right to my heart
Without saying a word you can light up the dark
Try as I may I can never explain
What I hear when you don't say a thing
The smile on your face lets me know that you need me
There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me
The touch of your hand says you'll catch me wherever I fall
You say it best, when you say nothing at all
All day long I can hear people talking out loud
But when you hold me near you drown out the crowd
Try as they may, they can never define
What's been said between your heart and mine
The smile on your face lets me know that you need me
There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me
The touch of your hand says you'll catch me wherever I fall
You say it best, when you say nothing at all
The smile on your face let's I know that you need me
There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me
The touch of your hand says you'll catch me wherever I fall
You say it best, when you say nothing at all
You say it best, when you say nothing at all
You say it best, when you say nothing at all
The smile on your face, the truth in your eyes
(You say it best, when you say nothing at all)
The touch of your hand lets me know that you need me
(You say it best, when you say nothing at all)
You say it best, when you say nothing at all
You say it best, when you say nothing at all
You say it best, when you say nothing at all
