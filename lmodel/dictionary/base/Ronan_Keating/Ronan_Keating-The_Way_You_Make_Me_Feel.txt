<song artist="Ronan_Keating" title="The_Way_You_Make_Me_Feel">
Couldn't feel much better
Than the way I feel tonight
Feel like I could live forever
Feel like I could fly
Coz when I thought I got it wrong, yeah
You somehow make things right
That's the way you make me feel
It's better than I've ever known it
Better than it's ever been
I can't seem to control it, no
It's the way you make me feel
Like the sun coming up in the morning
Like holding the world in your hands
In a way I could never imagine (yeah)
It's the way you make me feel
I couldn't feel that much better
Then when I am here with you
You make everything seem so easy
I'm telling you the truth
You never try to please me
But somehow....You always do
That's the way you make me feel
It's better than I've ever known it
Better than it's ever been
I can't seem to control it, no
It's the way you make me feel
Like the sun coming up in the morning
Like holding the world in your hands
In a way I could never imagine (yeah)
It's the way you make me feel
The way you make me feel (yeah)
It's the way you make me feel
The simple things you do to me
The simple things you say
Sometimes can't belive that it's for real
Yeah thats the way you make me feel
It's better than I've ever known it
Better than it's ever been
I can't seem to control it, no
It's the way you make me feel
Like the sun coming up in the morning
Like holding the world in your hands
In a way I could never imagine yeah
It's the way you make me feel
It's the way you make me feel
It's the way you make me feel (yeah)
It's the way you make me feel
It's the way you make me feel
