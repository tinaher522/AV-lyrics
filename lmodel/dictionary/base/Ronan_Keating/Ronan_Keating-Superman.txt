<song artist="Ronan_Keating" title="Superman">
I've been heading in the wrong direction
Hiding from my own protection
Running but my heart was standing still
I guess you saw the light inside me
Your love has been a torch to guide me
I hope I can be all that you deserve
[Chorus]
Well I'm no superman
But I'll love you that best I can
And you know I'm just flesh and bones, but with you
I feel I'm flying
Don't you know I'm no superman
But I'll always be your man
I was searching for a heart that's beating
As fast as the way I'm feeling
Trying to find some peace there in my soul
You know it was your love that saved me
The answer to my prayers you gave me
And I hope I'll be all you deserve
[Repeat chorus]
I'd fight for you
I'd die for you
You know I would
Hold back the night, light up the sky
Oh if I could, I'll always be your man...yeah
[Repeat chorus]
