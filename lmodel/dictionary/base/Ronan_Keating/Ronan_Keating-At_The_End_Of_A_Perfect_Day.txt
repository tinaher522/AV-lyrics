<song artist="Ronan_Keating" title="At_The_End_Of_A_Perfect_Day">
Chorus 1x:
It's all in a perfect day,
Just a part of a perfect way
And as long as the world goes around,
I will pray as I lay me down
At the end of a perfect day
Verse 1:
I wake to greet another morning,
And feel the cold beneath my feet
I rise to hear my future calling,
It's calling to me
Verse 2:
I watch the people through my window,
Then turn the radio up loud
And then I sit and watch the sun go,
And I know, as the rain's coming down
That..
Chorus 1x
Verse 3:
Yeah everybody needs some high's and low's,
I guess we're lucky to be here
And I don't care which way the wind blows,
'Cause I know, through the laughter and the tears
That..
Chorus 2x
At the end of a perfect, at the end of a perfect, at the end of a perfect day
Oh yeah yeah..
You and I..
Ohh yeah..
Mmmm...
