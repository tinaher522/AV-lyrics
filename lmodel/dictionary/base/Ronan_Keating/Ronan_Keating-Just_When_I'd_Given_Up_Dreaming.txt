<song artist="Ronan_Keating" title="Just_When_I'd_Given_Up_Dreaming">
I was an island desperate and barren
Praying for someone to save me
Felt like an ocean drowning alone
Searching for hope you once gave me
So what are we made of, what keeps us strong
It's your love that carries me home
I wanted to let go and give up the fight
Tell my heart it can stop beating
You gave me a reason to believe in myself
Just when I'd given up dreaming
Just when I'd given up dreaming
You are my lifeline willing and able
To guide me through every season
Your heart is a beacon shining so bright
It's your love that I follow home
So what are we made of, the answer is in
Your whisper that hangs in the wind
I wanted to let go and give up the fight
Tell my heart it can stop beating
You gave me a reason to believe in myself
Just when I'd given up dreaming
I close my eyes, I'm in your arms
The space that's between us won't keep us apart
Keep me in that special place in your heart
And I won't be alone anymore
Just when I'd give up dreaming
I wanted to let go and give up the fight
Tell my heart it can stop beating
You gave me a reason to believe in myself
Just when I'd given up dreaming
Just when I'd given up dreaming
Just when I'd given up dreaming
