<song artist="Ronan_Keating" title="Song_To">
You think you've seen it all
You've been all you can be
one thing comes along
and changes everything
You came into our world
and changed our way of life
there you were so helpless
and so beautiful
You'll recognize in time
the things I've said and done
you'll recognize in time
my son
Someone has passed it on
giving us the chance
watching as we grow
hope we can make a chance .....this time 
I hope I can help you grow
show you what I don't know
help you be the person
that you wanna be
time will pass so fast
I'm holding to the past
soon you'll be on your very own
You'll recognize in time
the things I've said and done
you'll recognize in time
my son
Someone has passed it on
giving us the chance
watching as we grow
hope we can make a change....this time
nananna nananan nananana 
You'll recognize in time
the things I've said and done
you'll recognize in time
my son
Someone has passed it on
giving us the chance
someone takes your hand
all part of the plan
Someone has passed it on
giving us the change
watching as we grow
hope we can make a change....this time
nananna nananan nananana...
