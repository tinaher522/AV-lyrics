<song artist="Ronan_Keating" title="Once_Upon_A_Lifetime">
Once upon a lifetime
I looked in someone's eyes
And felt the fire burning in my heart
For the very first time
I was scared and young
And had never tasted love
But a woman took my hand
And turned the boy into a man
Once upon a lifetime
Once upon a lifetime
You hold the Queen of Hearts
But if you gamble on a diamond when
The dealin' starts
You stand to lose it all
As the cards begin to fall
And the lesson learned is hard
You're only dealt the queen of hearts
Once upon a lifetime
So if you're taking chances, know the chance you take
A broken heart's a high price to pay
Foolish ways will make fools of the wise
And the best things seldom come along twice
Once upon a lifetime
You know that you've been blessed
When you hold your first born tenderly
Against your chest
And through the innocence you see
The value of a family
And you feel a special bond
That only comes along
Once upon a lifetime
So if you're taking chances, know the chance you take
A broken heart's a high price to pay
Foolish ways will make fools of the wise
And the best things seldom come along twice
And people only find love like yours and mine
Once upon a lifetime
