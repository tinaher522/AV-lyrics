<song artist="Ronan_Keating" title="The_Wild_Mountain_Thyme">
O the summer time has comin’
And the trees are sweetly bloomin’
And the wild mountain thyme
Grows around the bloomin’ heather
Will ye go
lassie
go?
And we’ll all go together
To pull wild mountain thyme
All around the bloomin’ heather
Will ye go
lassie
go?
I will build my love a bower
By yon cool crystal fountain
Yes I know it I will late
All the flowers o’ the mountain
Will ye go
lassie
go?
And we’ll all go together
To pull wild mountain thyme
All around the bloomin’ heather
Will ye go
lassie
go?
If my true love will not have me
I will surely find another
To pull wild mountain thyme，
All around the purple heather
Will ye go
lassie
go?
And we’ll all go together
To pull wild mountain thyme
All around the bloomin’ heather
Will ye go
lassie
go?
And we’ll all go together
To pull wild mountain thyme
All around the bloomin’ heather（the bloomin’ heather）
Will ye go
lassie
go?
Will ye go
lassie
go?
Will ye go
lassie
go?
