<song artist="Ronan_Keating" title="Sometimes">
I woke this morning, shoes untied
shower's bust, radio lied,
car won't start, it's cold outside,
somedays are like that.
Got the bus that never came,
walked to work, lost my job,
and you don't love me anymore,
somedays are like that.
Somedays are like that.
All the lights are stuck on red,
empty heart, empty bad
the guy on the news said love is dead,
somedays are like that.
Walked the dog, he ran away,
I've got nothing good to say,
you don't love me anymore
These days are all we have
don't waste them all, on the good gone bad
I lost her she had to go
now I know, now I know....
Somedays are like that (somedays are like that)
Somedays are like that (somedays are like that)
Somedays are like that (somedays are like that)
Somedays are like that (somedays are like that)
I woke this morning, shoes were tied,
shower worked I found my pride,
I think I'll take the park-and-ride,
somedays are like that
I was blind now I can see,
the road that lies ahead of me,
I guess you took the worst of me,
now I know, now I know
Somedays are like that (somedays are like that)
Somedays are like that (somedays are like that)
Somedays are like that (somedays are like that)
Somedays are like that (somedays are like that)
These days are all we have, don't waste them all, the good gone bad
These days are all we have, don't waste them all, the good gone bad
(Somedays are like that)
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, oooh
Somedays are like that (somedays are like that)
