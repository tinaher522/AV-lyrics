<song artist="Ronan_Keating" title="Scars">
Scars are warning signs left behind from choices that we made.
Scars follow you home and they won't let go
They're with you to the grave
Everybody has regrets, wounds they wish would heal
Clocks that won't reset
But I wouldn't change a thing
They're such a part of me
They make me who I am
No apologies for these scars
Scars...
Scars are simply lessons learnt
Bridges that we've burnt
So we won't go back
Scars show me where I've been, where I shouldn't go again
Keep my heart on track
I'm sure, sure before too long I'll have another souvenir from somewhere that went wrong
But I wouldn't change a thing
They're such a part of me
They make me who I am
No apologies for these scars
Scars...
Everybody has regrets
Wounds they wish would heal
Clocks that won't reset
But I wouldn't change a thing
They're such a part of me
They make me who I am
No apologies for these scars
Scars...
