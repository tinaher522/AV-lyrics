<song artist="Ronan_Keating" title="Addicted">
Just one more kiss, and I'll be gone
I won't write, I won't call you
No more girl, I swear that I'll be strong
Just One more taste of you, And I'll be fine
Girl I mean what i say today
But tomorrow I'll know that I was Lying
Cos Baby Oh
I only Wish you knew
How this feeling scares me show
It's just like letting, It's just like letting go
CHORUS:
And I guess If that's addiction
Then I guess That I'm addicted
And I guess that I'm your junkie fair enough (I'm your Junkie)
And I guess If that's addiction
Then I guess that i'm your Junkie
And I guess that I'm just strung out of your love
Girl I can't sleep, In these wet sheets
Cos I've got hot flushes, cold sweats
And a hunger that's making me weak
So hit me up
With your best stuff
All I need is a dime bag of attention
And maybe an Ounce of your trust
Cos letting go is harder than you know
I'm tearing up my heart to give my heart to you
as you walk right out of view (repeat CHORUS)
You go through my heart and Through my soul
Like a river gone out of control
It takes my resolve and washes it all away, all away
(Repeat CHORUS)
Don't walk away,baby (4x)
I'm addicted
