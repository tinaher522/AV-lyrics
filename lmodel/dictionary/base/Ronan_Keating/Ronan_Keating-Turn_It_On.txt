<song artist="Ronan_Keating" title="Turn_It_On">
I know you're wild, I know you're dangerous
I know you're bad for the both of us
So stick around, give me one more kiss
Get into this, hey yeah
Hangin' up is no alternative (no alternative)
Five years on we still remember it (remember it)
One stolen night, oh what I'd give (oh what I'd give)
Let's make it (let's make it) serious
*Chorus* 
Turn it on, turn it on again
I need to feel the world spin
Turn it on, turn it on again
I don't know why
But I've still got you under my skin
Our lives have changed but you still mean as much
I saw you with him in the traffic rush
What's bad for him must be good for us
This time it's real (this time it's real) 
It's the two of us (the two of us)
Turn it on, turn it on again
I need to feel the world spin
Turn it on, turn it on again
I don't know why
But I've still got you under my skin 
(My skin, my skin, my skin, my skin.. etc) 
Whatever's the real thing 
I wanna believe in
Whatever's the real thing
I wanna believe in
Everything
*Music*
Everything yeah yeah
(Turn it on) turn it on, turn it on again
(Turn it on) I need to feel the world spin
(Turn it on) turn it on, turn it on again
I don't know why
But I've still got you under my skin
(C'mon) turn it on, turn it on again (turn it on, turn it on)
I need to feel the world spin (c'mon turn it on)
Turn it on, turn it on again (again, hey)
I don't know why
But I've still got you under my skin
