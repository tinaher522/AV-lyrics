<song artist="Ronan_Keating" title="Friends_In_Time">
You've always been, here with me
And in your eyes, baby can I see
It's my reflection, doubles the truth
And what it tells me is that I belong to you
And when we pass each other once again
Then I will recognise my true friend
[Chorus]
We are two friends lost in time when your eyes are passing mine
I see we've been through so much in our lives
We are two friends so in love the times we've been together, oh baby
We're true friends in time
My little sister, when did you go
And what is, in your face that shows
A story buried, deep and strong
But that's a secret, one that we kept for so long
To say our love would be a lie
But what other word doesn't die
We are two friends lost in time when your eyes are passing mine
I see we've been through so much in our lives
[Repeat chorus x2]
