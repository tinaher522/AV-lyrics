<song artist="Ronan_Keating" title="Bring_You_Home">
When you're lost and there's no where to go
And your heart bears a heavy load
Don't give up 'cos you are not alone
'Cos I am always here to bring you home
You took a chance
You crossed the thin red line
And how every word can seem so unkind
Don't believe you'll ever lose it all
'Cos I am always here to bring you home
You'll make mistakes
And hearts will break
And tears will always fall
The world is turning and you are learning
What matters most of all
That you are not alone
Now's your time, so go on be free
Don't hold back, be all that you can be
And if you fall, you don't fall alone
'Cos I am always here to bring you home
You'll make mistakes
And hearts will break
And tears will always fall
The world is turning and you are learning
What matters most of all
That you are not alone
When you're lost and there's no where to go
And your heart bears a heavy load
Don't give up 'cos you are not alone
'Cos I am always here to bring you home
