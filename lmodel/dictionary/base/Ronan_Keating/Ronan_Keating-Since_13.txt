<song artist="Ronan_Keating" title="Since_13">
You get lost and lonely
Do you remember times we had
When we were young and crazy fools 
Oh oh 
Well we went mad on Sundays
We'd go dancing off our feet 
Yeah we were breaking all the rules Oh oh 
I've always been with you since 13
So come on up, and come on in
You can wear my clothes again 
Come on up, and come on in 
Pretend to we were way back when
I'm still in love with you my friend 
Still since then
You could be in a convent 
You could be on a New York train 
You could be gettin' drunk in Spain, but you're not
I've had your heart with me since 13 
Oh yeah 
So come on up, and come on in 
You can wear my clothes again 
Come on up, and come on in
Pretend to we were way back when 
I'm still in love with you my friend
Still since then 
Okay you might have not said yes, but you did 
And I weigh the benefits 
So come on up, and come on in 
You can wear my clothes again 
Come on up, and come on in 
Pretend to we were way back when
I'm still in love with you my friend 
Still since then
I'm still in love with you my friend 
Still since then Still since then 
A way back when
Still since then, since then, since then 
Na na na na 
I've always been with you since 13 
A way back when 
Still since then
