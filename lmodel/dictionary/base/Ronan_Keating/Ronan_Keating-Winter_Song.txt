<song artist="Ronan_Keating" title="Winter_Song">
This is my winter song to you.
The storm is coming soon,
It rolls in from the sea
My voice; a beacon in the night.
My words will be your light,
To carry you to me.
Is love alive?
Is love alive?
Is love?
They say that things just cannot grow
Beneath the winter snow,
Or so i have been told.
They say we're buried far,
Just like a distant star
I simply cannot hold.
Is love alive?
Is love alive?
Is love alive?
This is my winter song.
December never felt so long,
Cause youre not where you belong;
Inside my arms.
I still believe in summer days.
The seasons always change,
And life will find a way.
I'll be your harvester of light,
And send it out tonight
So we can start again.
Is love alive?
Is love alive?
Is love alive?
This is my winter song.
December never felt so long,
Cause youre not where you belong;
Inside my arms.
This is my winter song to you.
The storm is coming soon
It rolls in from the sea.
My love a beacon in the night.
My words will be your light
To carry you to me.
Is love alive? (*12)
