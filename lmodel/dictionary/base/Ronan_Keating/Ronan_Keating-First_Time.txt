<song artist="Ronan_Keating" title="First_Time">
Valentines, those butterflies
Gets me out best top inside
Got me feeling like a kid again
Oh I even run and run, telling all my friends
Now every day has a reason
Every night is the real thing, woahhh
Girl you make it feel like the first time
Like there's never been another
Girl you make it real,like the first time
Everytime you lay down by my side
Ohh, it's the first time
Every moment spent with you
Something different always something new
I watch you sleeping, I hear you sigh
Oh I even love the way you cry
Now every kiss is a season, and every touch keeps me believing
Oh, girl you make it feel like the first time
Like there's never been another
Girl you make it real,like the first time
Everytime you lay down by my side
Ohh, it's the first time
It's the last time you'll be alone
I'm there for you
I walk a circle, I see this through
I need you here to write this song
You make me feel like I belong
Every time you lay down by my side
It's the first time
Mmm
Ooh yeah yeah
Ooh yeah
Now every day has a reason
Every night is the real thing, ohhh
Girl you make it feel like the first time
Like there's never been another
Girl you make it real,like the first time
Everytime you lay down by my side
Ohh, it's the first time
It's the first time
