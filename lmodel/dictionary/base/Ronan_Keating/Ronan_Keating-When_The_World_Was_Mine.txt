<song artist="Ronan_Keating" title="When_The_World_Was_Mine">
Oh yeah yeah yeah
It never rained, the sun was always shinin'
And every traffic light was always green
There was a time when every door was open
And the universe was mine, or so it seemed
Every roll is seven or eleven
That it would ever end never crossed my mind
I was flyin' higher than the heavens
Back when the world was mine
*Chorus*
Sometimes a man can't see when he has it all
Take a look at me, oh how the mighty fall 
Once I ruled the earth, once upon a time
When I had your love
That's when the world was mine
Oh-woah.. mmm..
Oh the changes I'd make if I had the power (if I had the power)
How could I have so much and be so blind
But at least for a bright and shining moment
I had you, and the world was mine
Sometimes a man can't see when he has it all
Take a look at me, oh how the mighty fall 
Once I ruled the earth, once upon a time
When I had your love
That's when the world was mine... 
Woah...
*Music*
Once I ruled the earth, once upon a time
When I had your love
That's when the world was mine
When I had your love
That's when the world was mine
Woah.. 
That's when the world was mine
Oh.. 
(Once I ruled the earth, once upon a time)
(When I had your love) when I had your love
(That's when the world was mine) yeah
(Once I ruled the earth) once I ruled the earth
(Once upon a time) once upon a time
(When I had your love, that's when the world was mine)
(Once I ruled the earth, once upon a time)
(When I had your love) yeah 
(That's when the world was mine)
(That's when the world was mine)
(When the world was mine) yeah
*Music To Fade*
