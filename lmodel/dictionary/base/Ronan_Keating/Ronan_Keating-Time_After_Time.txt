<song artist="Ronan_Keating" title="Time_After_Time">
Lying in my bed I hear the clock tick
and think of you
caught up in circles
confusion is nothing new
Flashback
warm nights
almost left behind
suitcases of memories
time after
sometimes you picture me
I’m walking too far ahead
you’re calling to me,
I can’t hear what you’ve said
Then you say "go slow"
I fall behind
the second hand unwinds
if you’re lost you can look
and you will find me
time after time
if you fall I will catch you
I’ll be waiting
time after time
if you’re lost you can look
and you will find me
time after time
if you fall I will catch you
I’ll be waiting
time after time
after my picture fades and darkness has
turned to gray 
watching through windows
you’re wondering
if I’m OK
secrets stolen from deep inside
the drum beats out of time
if you’re lost you can look
and you will find me
time after time
if you fall I will catch you
I’ll be waiting
time after time
you said go slow
I fall behind
the second hand unwinds
if you’re lost you can look
and you will find me
time after time
if you fall I will catch you
I’ll be waiting
time after time
if you’re lost you can look
and you will find me
time after time
if you fall I will catch you
I’ll be waiting
time after time
time after time
time after time
time after time
