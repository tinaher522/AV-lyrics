<song artist="Ronan_Keating" title="To_Be_Loved">
The song of a little bird
The joy in three little words
I know it's real, this is how it feels
To be loved by you
The stars from a midnight sky
The melody from a lullaby
There's nothing real, that I wouldn't steal
To be loved by you
[Chorus]
To be loved by you
If everybody knows, it's only 'cause it shows
A smile to put you on a high
A kiss that sets your soul alight
Would it be all right if I spent tonight
Being loved by you
[Repeat chorus]
So carry on carry me away from here
All my days 'til the twilight of my life
I know what it is I need
It's clear as a shallow stream
It's as it seems, my only dreams
To be loved by you
