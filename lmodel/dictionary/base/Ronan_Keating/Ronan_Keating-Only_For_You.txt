<song artist="Ronan_Keating" title="Only_For_You">
Baby I've been thinking of you
Gotta picture in my mind
They say I'm falling in love
Makes you blind
You opened up my eyes
Brought our feelings deep inside
No one believes in me like you do
No one can ever take your place
You're like food to my soul
And only you can make me feel this way
And I gotta say
When I'm feeling down you are there
And while you're holding me, you say
There's no sacrifice to be loving you, no no
And I feel it too, yes I do
But only for you
Baby there's a reason why we met
Why we still are holding on
I never knew a love so strong
When I look into your eyes
Knowing my love will never die
Can't live without you by my side
No one can ever take your place
You're like food to my soul
Yes you are
And only you can make me feel this way
And I gotta say
When I'm feeling down you are there
And while you're holding me, you say
There's no sacrifice to be loving you, no no
And I feel it too, yes I do
But only for you
And I gotta say
When I'm feeling down you are there, you say
There's no sacrifice to be loving you, no no
And I feel it too, yes I do
But only for you...
