<song artist="Ronan_Keating" title="Somedays">
I woke this morning, shoes untight
shower's burst, radio light,
car won't start, it's cold outside,
somedays are like that.
Got the bus that never came,
walked to work, lost my job,
and you don't love me anymore,
somedays are like that.
Somedays are like that.
All the lights are stuck on red,
empty heart, empty bad
die on the news and love is dead,
somedays are like that.
Walked the dog, that ran away,
I've got nothing good to say,
you don't love me anymore
These days are all we have
don't waste them all, and good gone bad
I lost her she had to go
now I know, now I know....
Chorus:
Somedays are like that (somedays are like that) (4x)
I woke this morning, shoes were tight,
shower worked I found my pride,
I think I take the parking ride,
somedays are like that
I was blind now I can see,
the road that lies ahead of me,
I guess you took the worst of me,
now I know, now I know
Somedays are like that (somedays are like that) (4x)
These days are all we have, don't waste them all, the good gone bad
These days are all we have, don't waste them all, the good gone bad
(Somedays are like that) (4x)
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, oooh
Somedays are like that (somedays are like that)
