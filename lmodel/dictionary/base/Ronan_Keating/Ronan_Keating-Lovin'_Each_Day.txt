<song artist="Ronan_Keating" title="Lovin'_Each_Day">
Ah C'mon yeah
Ah C'mon yeah
We're lovin' each day as if it's the last
Dancin' all night and havin' a blast
Please baby
I need you here
Girl I'm on a mission
To cure my condition
'Coz without your kissin'
My heart's just in prison
So I'm hopin' and wishin'
That girl I'm forgiven
Say yeah - yeah yeah
'Coz everytime you leave me
I'm sad
The moment you're returning
I'm glad
So let's not go forgetting what we had
'Coz it's bad - so damn bad
We're lovin' each day as if it's the last
Dancin' all night and havin' a blast
Oh baby I want you right here next to me
We're lovin' each day as if it's the last
Dancin' all night and havin' a laugh
Please baby I need you here
If I've hurt your feelings
Then baby we're even
'Coz I've been a greivin'
Since you said you're leavin'
But now you're by my side
Let's not fight
'Coz you're right
And everytime I lose you
I'm lost
The more you versus me girl
There's just us
'Coz anything about you is just a bust
Baby trust - you're a must
(yeah yeah)
We're lovin' each day as if it's the last
Dancin' all night and havin' a blast
Oh baby I want you right here next to me
We're lovin' each day as if it's the last
Dancin' all night and havin' a laugh
Please baby I need you here
So don't go throwing our love away
It's here to stay
I'm telling you
There's nothing that can stop us anyway
Our love's an ocean 
Let's get it in motion
We're lovin' each day as if it's the last
Dancin' all night and havin' a blast
Oh baby I want you right here next to me
We're lovin' each day as if it's the last
Dancin' all night and havin' a laugh
Please baby I need you here
I need you here (4x)
'Coz we're lovin' and we're givin'
and we're hopin' and we're dreamin' (2x)
