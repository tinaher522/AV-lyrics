<song artist="Ronan_Keating" title="This_Is_Your_Song">
Lived your life to the full,
with a lifetime of smiles.
Made us know right from wrong,
always knowing of lies.
You made us be tough,
but never too rough
Rise above's what you said,
never easily lead.
And one day we'll all sing along;
(Chorus)
Cause this is your song,
We wrote it for you.
It won't take all day,
just a minute or two.
You were our friend,
walk with you to the end.
And one day we'll all sing along;
Cause this is your song.
So we'll try and go on,
loving all that we know.
Through the hardest of times,
you put on a show.
You made us stand tall,
when all around us would fall.
Even when you were low,
you believed you could fly.
And one day we'll all sing along;
(Chorus)
Cause this is your song,
I wrote it for you.
It won't take all day,
just a minute or two.
You were our friend,
walk with you to the end.
And one day we'll all sing along;
Cause this is your song.
Oooooh yeah
And one day we'll all sing along;
(Chorus)
Cause this is your song,
I wrote it for you.
It'll take all our lives,
just to help us get through.
You were our friend,
walk with you to the end
And one day we'll sing along
This is your song
