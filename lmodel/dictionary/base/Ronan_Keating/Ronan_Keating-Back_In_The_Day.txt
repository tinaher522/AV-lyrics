(Back in the day, back in the day)
She left me all alone
She told me on the phone
Now that just don't seem right
I will close my eyes
And turn out all the lights
But I won't cry tonight
'Cause I'm already sleepin'
All of those things are in the past
Like a beaten up faded photograph
Can't remember your name, who are you again
You're history, history yeah
*Chorus*
Back in the day, my my hey hey
No more livin' for yesterday
Come and kiss me, I will prove 
That there's more to me than you
Back in the day, my my hey hey
You don't love me and that's okay
I'm movin' on and movin' out
Think I can't pull through just watch me without you
She always picked a fight 
Every other night
And she was always right
Yeah right
Now I won't be a fool
I guess I broke some rules
But I broke them on my own
When you were with someone else at night
All of those things are in the past
Like a beaten up faded photograph
Can't remember your name, who are you again
You're history, history yeah..
Back in the day, my my hey hey
No more livin' for yesterday
Come and kiss me, I will prove 
That there's more to me than you
Back in the day, my my hey hey
You don't love me and that's okay
I'm movin' on and movin, out
Think I can't pull through just watch me without you
There's a time, punchin' the wall
Dyin' to call, willin' to crawl
No way, whatever, whatever 
I guess we're not meant to be together
That's okay
Back in the day, my my hey hey
No more livin' for yesterday
Come and kiss me, I will prove 
That there's more to me than you (back in the day)
Back in the day, my my hey hey
You don't love me and that's okay
Movin' on and I'm movin, out
Think I can't pull through just watch me without you
