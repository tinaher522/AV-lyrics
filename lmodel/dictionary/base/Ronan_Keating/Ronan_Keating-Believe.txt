<song artist="Ronan_Keating" title="Believe">
You said you could see no end
The world and himself were all on your back
I vowed to take your hand
Show the world in a different light
All that you've done
You've got to believe
In all of your dreams
No matter what the world can throw at you
You know you can believe
Believe in me
And after all
I'll still believe in you
And even if you cannot see
The brighter light ahead i'll see
You must believe, believe in me
And after all I'll still believe in you
I'll put away the clouds
That cover you up that leave you down
I won't leave you all alone
I'll be there for you in your darkest hour
And all that you've done
You've got to believe
In all of your dreams
No matter what the world can throw at you
You know you can believe, believe in me
And after all I'll still believe in you
And even if you cannot see
The brighter light ahead I'll see
You must believe, believe in me
And after all I'll still believe in you
And when it's dark outside
I'll protect you from the night
My shoulder you can rely
I won't do you wrong
All that you've done
You've got to believe
In all of your dreams, all of your dreams
No matter what the world can throw at you
You know you can believe, believe in me
And after all, I'll still believe in you
And even if you cannot see
The brighter light ahead I'll see
You must believe, believe in me
And after all I'll still believe in you
