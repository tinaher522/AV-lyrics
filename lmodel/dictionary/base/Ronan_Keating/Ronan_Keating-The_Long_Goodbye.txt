<song artist="Ronan_Keating" title="The_Long_Goodbye">
I know they say if you love somebody - you should set them free
But it sure is hard to do
It sure is hard to do
I know they say if they don't come back again then it's meant to be
Those words ain't pulling me through
Cos I'm still I love with you
I spend each day here waiting for a miracle
But it's just you and me going through the mill climbing up a hill
Chorus
This is the long goodbye
Somebody tell me why
Two lovers in love can't make it
Just what kind of love keeps breaking a heart
No matter how hard I try
You're gonna make me cry
Come on baby it's over let's face it
All that's happening here is a long goodbye
Sometimes I ask my heart did we really give our love a chance
I know without a doubt
That we turned it inside out
And if we walked away it would make more sense
But it tears me up inside
Just to think we still could try
How long must we keep running on this carousel
Going round and round and never getting anywhere on a wing and prayer
Chorus x 2
The long goodbye
The long goodbye
This is the long goodbye
