<song artist="Ronan_Keating" title="Caught">
"Feel the freedom in me
We could live by the sea
Encast the dreams upon the icy water
But that's not how it is
In this world we live
We crossed the line some time ago
Danger's all we know
We are are soldiers
Fighting for a cause that we're not sure of
You and I are
Caught between the two desires
Stolen ice and passion fire
All the while the stakes get higher baby
We are, caught inside a web of darkness
Never knowing where the heart is
Running when the hardest part is knowing
We are caught
So caught
If we could fool the clock
And go back to the spot
Would we end up just the same, only different
That's a fantasy
But it's not for you and me
The world we know is live or die
Trying to survive
We are strangers
Travelling in endless nights of shadows
You and I are
Caught between the two desires
Stolen ice and passion fire
All the while the stakes get higher baby
We are, caught inside a web of darkness
Never knowing where the heart is
Running when the hardest part is knowing
We are caught
We are
Wohhhhh
We are are soldiers
Fighting for a cause that we're not sure of
You and I are
Caught between the two desires
Stolen ice and passion fire
All the while the stakes get higher baby
We are, caught inside a web of darkness
Never knowing where the heart is
Running when the hardest part is knowing
We are caught
So caught"
