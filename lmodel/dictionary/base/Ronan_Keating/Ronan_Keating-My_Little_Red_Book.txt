<song artist="Ronan_Keating" title="My_Little_Red_Book">
I just got out my little red book
The minute that you said goodbye
I thumbed right through my little red book
I wasn't gonna sit and cry
And I went from A to Z
I took out every pretty girl in town
They danced with me and while I held them
All I did was talk about you
Hear your name and I'd start to cry
There is just no getting over you
No girl who's in my little red book
Just ever could replace your love
And each girl in my little red book
Knows you're the one I'm thinkin' of
Won't you please come back to me?
Without your precious love I can't go on
Where can you be? I need you so much
All I do is to talk about you
Hear your name and I start to cry
There is just no getting over you, no, no, no
Won't you please come back to me?
Without your precious love I can't go on
Where can you be? I need you so much
All I do is to talk about you
Hear your name and I start to cry
There is just no getting over you, no, no
All I do is to talk, talk about you
Hear your name and I start to cry
There is just no getting over you, no, no
All I do is to talk, to talk, to talk
Hear your name and
