<song artist="Ronan_Keating" title="Nothing_At_All">
It's amazing how you can speak right to my heart
Without saying a word, you can light up the dark
Try as I may I could never explain
What I hear when you don't say a thing
The smile on your face lets me know that you need me
There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me
The touch of your hand says you'll catch me when ever I fall
You say it best... when you say nothing at all
All day long I can hear people talking out loud
But when you hold me near, you drown out the crowd (the crowd)
Try as they may they can never define
What's been said between your heart and mine
CHORUS X 2
(You say it best when you say nothing at all
You say it best when you say nothing at all...)
The smile on your face
The truth in your eyes
The touch of your hand
Let's me know that you need me...
CHORUS
(You say it best when you say nothing at all
You say it best when you say nothing at all...)
The smile on your face
The truth in your eyes
The touch of your hand
Let's me know that you need me...
(You say it best when you say nothing at all
You say it best when you say nothing at all...)
