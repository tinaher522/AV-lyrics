<song artist="Ronan_Keating" title="Love_Won't_Work">
Whooooooah
Whooooooah yeah
Whooooooah...whoooah yeah
I don't know what you do to me
I only know it works
Sometimes you make me feel so good
Sometimes you make me hurt
'cause you give me a reason
For getting up each day
I ain't no poet baby
But I'll say hey
Anywhere you go
I'll be by your side
Cause baby love won't work
If we don't try
I don't know what you're doing to me
But I'm leaving it to fate
I'm gonna be with you forever
And baby I can't wait
Our love keeps living baby
While other loves have died
It ain't the destination
It's the ride
And anywhere you go

I'll be by your side
Because baby love won't work
If we don't try
Sometimes we're up
Sometimes we're down
I'll be ok as long as you're around
And girl there's something you've got to know
We'll make it through any storm
If we both don't let go
You gotta know, you gotta know yeah
Anywhere you go
I'll be by your side
Because baby love won't work
If we don't try
Sometimes we're up
Sometimes we're down
I'll be ok as long as you're around
We gotta try...we gotta try
And anywhere you go
I'll be by your side
Because baby love won't work
If we don't try
