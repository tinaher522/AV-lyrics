<song artist="Ronan_Keating" title="Let_Her_Down_Easy">
You're top man on the scene 
You don't think life comes in between 
but hey, she's just seventeen
She feels that she's a wordly girl but 
Man you've been around the world 
She is just some worried daddy's pearl
Even though there's nothing I can say 
To cheat you and nature any way
Let her down easy 
Her heart is on a dime 
Let her down easy
And you'll grow up in time 
In her strawberry eyes 
The way she sees you signifies that
She's susceptible to your velvet lies 
But if you must lay her down, may a 
Butterscotch glow be her dressing gown
and please do not lead her own when you leave town
Even though there's nothing I can say 
To cheat you and nature any way
Let her down easy 
Her heart is on a dime 
Let her down easy
And you'll grow up in time 
She's a woman now 
With a daughter to make her proud 
in her crayon world of paper clouds 
She still remembers you 
The first boy that she gave it to 
And she laughs at how little then she knew
Even though there's nothing I can say 
To cheat you and nature any way
Let her down easy 
Her heart is on a dime 
Let her down easy
And you'll grow up in time
