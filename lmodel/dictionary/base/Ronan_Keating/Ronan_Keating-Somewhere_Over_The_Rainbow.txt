<song artist="Ronan_Keating" title="Somewhere_Over_The_Rainbow">
Somewhere, over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I heard of
Once in a lullaby
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream
Really do come true
Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Where troubles melt like lemon drops
And way above the chimney tops
Is where you'll find me, and
Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high

There's a land that I heard of
Once in a lullaby
Where troubles melt like lemon drops
And way above the chimney tops
That's where you'll find me, and
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream
Really do come true
If happy little blue birds fly
Beyond the rainbow
Why, or why, can't i?
