<song artist="Ronan_Keating" title="Love_Won't_Work_(If_We_Don't_Try)">
I don't know what you're doing to me
I only know it works
Sometimes you make me feel so good
Sometimes you make me hurt
Because you give me a reason
For getting up each day
I ain't no poet baby
But I'll say
That anywhere you go
I'll be by your side
Because baby love won't work
If we don't try
I don't know what you're doing to me
But I'm leaving it to fate
I'm gonna be with you forever
And baby I can't wait
Our love keeps living baby
While other loves have died
It ain't the destination
It's the ride
And anywhere you go
I'll be by your side
Because baby love won't work
If we don't try
Sometimes we're up
Sometimes we're down
But always know
I'm gonna be around
And girl there's something you've got to know
We'll make it through any storm
If we both don't let go
And anywhere you go
I'll be by your side
Because baby love won't work
If we don't try
Sometimes we're up
Sometimes we're down
But always know
I'm gonna be around
And anywhere you go
I'll be by your side
Because baby love won't work
If we don't try
