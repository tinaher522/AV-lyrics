<song artist="Ronan_Keating" title="Somebody_Else">
I hear the laughter
I know that something specials going on
I hear the passion
You mention his name
You're talking on the phone
And you tell your friends
That ever since he came
Everything's different, everything's changed
And baby we both know
What this means for you, for me
Chorus:
Somebody else now
There's someone between us
There's somebody calling in the middle of the night, yeah
And I can't sleep now
For all of the crying, yeah
And I know when you hold him tight
He's the best part, best part of our lives
I watch from a distance
And I see the way you talk to him so close
And I'm not the only one you want to hold
And surely we both know
What this means to you, to me
Chorus:
Somebody else now
There's someone between us
There's somebody calling in the middle of the night, yeah
And I can't sleep now
For all of the crying, yeah
And I know when you hold him tight
He's the best part, best part baby
Girl I'm never gonna walk away
For what we've got together
Cos you need me now more than ever
I can only pray that we will always be together
I'm not walking out
Chorus:
Cos somebody else now
Someone between us
Somebody calling in the middle of the night,
And I can't sleep now
For all of the crying, yeah!
And I know when you hold him tight,
He's the best part, the best part of our lives, yeah
And it's never felt so right
I know when we hold him tight
He's the best part, the best part of our lives
