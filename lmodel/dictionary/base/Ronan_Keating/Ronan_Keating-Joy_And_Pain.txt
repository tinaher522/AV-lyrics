<song artist="Ronan_Keating" title="Joy_And_Pain">
Heaven ain't your place girl, not now anyways
And in this hell yeah yeah, you cant erase
All of the pain, that you've been given
That ain't the reason yeah, that you've been driven
Watch the hand as it's movin', 24 times around
Every second's like a minute, till you're back on the ground
I've felt joy and I've felt pain (girl Im sorry)
I've felt joy and I've felt pain (girl Im sorry)
I've felt joy and I've felt pain (girl Im sorry)
But I know I'm gonna see you again
Girl we had our chances, we knew from the start
That we could take heaven yeah and tear it apart tear it apart
You gotta take a chance girl, you gotta lead me by the hand
And turn this wild one, into a family man
Many miles been between us since I walked away
Girl I'm sorry what I did to you, this time I'm here to stay
I've felt joy and I've felt pain (girl Im sorry)
I've felt joy and I've felt pain (girl Im sorry)
I've felt joy and I've felt pain (girl Im sorry)
But I know baby I'm gonna see you again
But I know yeah
I've felt pain I've felt joy yeah
Heaven ain't your place girl, not now anyways
And in this hell yeah yeah, you cant erase
All of the pain, that you've been given
That ain't the reason yeah, that you've been driven
Watch the hand as it's movin', 24 times around
Every second's like a minute, till you're back on the ground
I've felt joy and I've felt pain (and the girls say)
I've felt joy and I've felt pain (and the girls say)
I've felt joy and I've felt pain (girl Im sorry)
I've felt joy and I've felt pain (girl Im sorry)
But I know I'm gonna see you again
