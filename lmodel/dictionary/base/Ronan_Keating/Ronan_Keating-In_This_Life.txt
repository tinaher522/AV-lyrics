<song artist="Ronan_Keating" title="In_This_Life">
For all I've been blessed with in this life,
There was an emptyness in me,
I was imprisoned by the power of gold,
With one honest touch you set me free.
Chorus
Let the world stop turning,
Let the sun stop burning,
Let them tell you love's not worth going through,
If it all falls apart,
I will know deep in my heart,
The only dream that mattered had come true,
In this life, I was loved by you
For every mountain I have climbed,
And every raging river crossed,
You were the treasure longed to find,
Without your love I would be lost.
Let the world stop turning,
Let the sun stop burning,
Let them tell you love's not worth going through,
If it all falls apart,
I will know deep in my heart,
The only dream that mattered had come true,
In this life, I was loved by you.
In this life I was loved by you.
