<song artist="Ronan_Keating" title="Starlight">
If I ever let you down... friend
I'll apologize... now
and if I didn't hear you call for me
I was feeling sorry for myself
When the moon begins to fade ...out
and the sun don't care to shine
when your heavens starts to fall...down
I'll be your guiding starlight
And If I serenade myself
and put my pride on the shelf
and tell you that I was wrong
I guess it's not news to me
I guess it's just history
that a man gets it wrong
gets it wrong...
When the morning hurts your eyes..friend
and you can't see... from crying
and the day turns into night time
and hope holds no tomorrow
When the moon begins to fade ...out
and your sun don't care to shine
when the heavens starts to fall...down
I'll be your guiding starlight
And this fair weather friend
was never at the rainbow's end
to sing the saddest song
I guess it's not news to me
I guess it's just history
should have been there all along
all along
If the moon begins to fade ...out
and your sun don't care to shine
when the heavens starts to fall...down
I'll be your guiding starlight
I'll be your guiding starlight
I'll be your guiding starlight
