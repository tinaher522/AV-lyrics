<song artist="Ronan_Keating" title="Last_Thing_On_My_Mind">
Four O'Clock in the morning
My minds filled with a thousand thoughts of you
And how you left without warning
But looking back I'm sure you tried to talk it through
Now I see it so clearly
We're together but living separate lives
So I wanna tell you I'm sorry
Baby I can't find the words
But if I could, then you know I would
Yeah
No I won't let go, know what we can be
I won't watch my life crashing down on me
Guess I had it all right there before my eyes, yeah
Girl, I'm sorry now we're the last thing on my mind
You carried me like a river
How far we've come still surprises me
And now I look in the mirror (look in the mirror)
Staring back is a man I used to be, with you
How I long for you, yeah
No I won't let go, know what we can be
I won't watch my life crashing down on me
Guess I had it all right there before my eyes, yeah
Girl, I'm sorry now we're the last thing on my mind
Girl, I'm sorry I was wrong
Could have been there
Should have been so strong
So I'm sorry
No I won't let go, know what we can be
I won't watch my life crashing down on me
Guess I had it all right there before my eyes, yeah
Girl, I'm sorry now we're the last thing on my mind
I won't watch my life crashing down on me
Guess I had it all right there before my eyes, yeah
Girl, I'm sorry now, we're the last thing on my mind
On my mind
On my mind
