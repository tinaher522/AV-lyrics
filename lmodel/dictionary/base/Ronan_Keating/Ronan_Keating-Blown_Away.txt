<song artist="Ronan_Keating" title="Blown_Away">
You make me feel like a stranger in my own house
You got me running around just like a scared mouse
You were always saying that I was your destiny
Then pretty baby why aren't you here next to me
You made all of my dreams
And fantasies come alive, but it was lies
I gave you all my love and got shot between the eyes
Well baby I'm blown away
The way you made me go away
You'll let me know this love has been thrown away
Now every time I think of you
I'm blown away
You got me feeling like a stranger in my own heart
I'm acting so together but I'm falling apart
I'm begging lover, begging Mother, begging Saviour please
I ain't got no leg to stand on much less my knees
You never even tried to let me know where we stand was it planned?
That when you ran away you'd leave a bomb in my hands
And baby I'm blown away
The way you made me go away
You'll let me know how this love has been thrown away
Now every time I think of you
I'm blown away
Were all these dreams for nothing?
You make me want to cry
We made this flower to grow not to die
So my baby...
