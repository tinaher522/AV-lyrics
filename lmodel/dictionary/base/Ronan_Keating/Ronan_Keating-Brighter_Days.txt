<song artist="Ronan_Keating" title="Brighter_Days">
I've done a lot of living in my life
Chased my share of rainbows in the sky
Before I stopped to ask the question why
I've fallen out of love too many times
But now I see
The possibilities
Of how my life could be
From any other love I'd walk away
Love is temporary I would say
Now each night I find a reason to stay
With you there's always brighter days
I've broken a heart, a heart or two
I've let the curtain fall I guess, It's true
The thought of something borrowed,
something blue
Was something that i never could persue
But now you're here
My doubt has disappeared
The clouds are gone, It's clear
From any other love I'd walk away
Love is temorary I would say
Now each night I find a reason to stay
With you there's always brighter days
Even on the coldest nights
Even when the sun won't shine
It's sweeter in the morning time
Just knowing that you're here
From any other love I'd walk away
Love is temporary I would say
Now each night I find a reason to stay
With you there's always brighter days
