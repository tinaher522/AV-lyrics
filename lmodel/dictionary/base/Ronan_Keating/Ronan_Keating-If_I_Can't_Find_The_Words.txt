<song artist="Ronan_Keating" title="If_I_Can't_Find_The_Words">
If I can't find the words
Oh oh oh oh
Waitin' for this feelin'
That I'm drownin' in to subside
You make me swim like a beginner
Like I'm new at life
And all these words don't come easy
No they always seem to stall
There is awkward silence yeah-yeah
Anytime we talk
Oh but I wanna let you in
I wanna ease all your doubts
I keep tryin' to get it out
[Chorus]
But if I can't find the words 
To tell you what I'm feelin'
Baby that don't mean
It don't mean that I don't feel it
I'm tryin' to tell you girl
But if you don't believe just look and see
My face says what you mean to me
When I can't find the words
I know I can send you flowers
To try to make my feelin's clear
And girl, I could hold you tight for hours
I wanna tell ya what you're tryin' to hear
Oh and I wanna let you in
I wanna ease all your doubts
I keep tryin' to get it out
But if I can't find the words 
To tell you what I'm feelin'
Well baby that don't mean
It don't mean that I don't feel it
I'm tryin' to tell you girl
But if you don't believe just look and see
My face says what you mean to me
When I can't find the words
Girl I know sometimes I leave you so upset
'Cause I got all these bits and pieces in my head
I know I'm a puzzle and you struggle with the things that I haven't said
When I can't find the words
No I can't
When I can't find the words
When I, when I, when I can't find the words
I wanna ease all your doubts (ease all your doubts) 
I keep tryin' to get it out 
But if I can't find the words 
To tell you what I'm feelin'
Well baby that don't mean
It don't mean that I don't feel it
I'm tryin' to tell you girl
But if you don't believe just look and see
My smile says what you mean to me
When I can't find the words
If I can't find the words 
To tell you what I'm feelin'
Well baby that don't mean
It don't mean that I don't feel it
I wanna tell you girl, what you don't believe
Look and see, my smile says what you mean to me 
(My smile says what you mean to me)
When I can't find the words
