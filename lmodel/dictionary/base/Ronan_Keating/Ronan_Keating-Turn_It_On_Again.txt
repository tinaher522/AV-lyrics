<song artist="Ronan_Keating" title="Turn_It_On_Again">
I know you're wild 
I know you're dangerous
I know you're bad for the both of us
So stick around
Give me one more kiss
Get into this yeah yeah
Hanging up there's no alternative 
Five years on we still remember it
A stolen night oh what I'd give
Let's make it serious
Turn it on. Turn it on again
I need to feel the world spin
Turn it on. Turn it on again
I don't know why 
But I've still got you under my skin
Our lives have changed 
It used to mean as much
I saw you with him 
In the traffic rush
What's right for him 
Must be good for us
This time it's real
It's the two of us
Turn it on. Turn it on again
I need to feel the world spin
Turn it on. Turn it on again
I don't know why 
But I've still got you under my skin
I wanna believe in
Whatever's the real thing
I wanna believe in everything
Everything
Turn it on. Turn it on again
I need to feel the world spin
Turn it on. Turn it on again
I don't know why 
But I've still got you under my skin
Turn it on. Turn it on again
I need to feel the world spin
Turn it on. Turn it on again
I don't know why 
But I've still got you under my skin
Turn it on
