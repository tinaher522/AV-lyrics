<song artist="Ronan_Keating" title="I_Will_Miss_You">
I thought that i was like an island
Guess i was wrong, guess i was wrong
I see your face, then it hits me
That i will miss you, oh when you're gone
My heart will sleep, until you wake it
I hope and pray, it won't be long
This house is old, and when you leave it
Then i will miss you, oh when you're gone
And i've been taking it all for granted
It was there in front of my face
I couldn't seem to understand it
And how could i know, how could i lose my way
I've been taking it all for granted
I got no excuses for that
I couldn't seem to understand it, but how could i know
I wonder when you look back
Will you remember
Our road is straight, our road is long
I wish you well
My heart is with you
And i will miss you, oh i will miss you
I know i will miss you, oh when you're gone
