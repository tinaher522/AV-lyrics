<song artist="Ronan_Keating" title="She_Believes">
While she lays sleeping
I stay out late at night and play my songs
And sometimes all the nights can be so long
And it's good when I finally make it home all alone
While she lays dreaming
I touch her face across the silver light
I see her dreams that drift up to the sky
And she wakes up to my kiss
And I say it's alright, and I hold her tight
And she believes in me
I'll never know just what she sees in me
I told her someday if she was my girl
I could change the world with my songs but I was wrong
But she has faith in me
And so I go on trying faithfully
Forever in my heart she will remain
And I hope and pray I will find a way, find a way
While she lays waiting
I ask myself why do I hurt her so
What calls me on along this lonely road
Why don't I turn around and head back home where I belong
While she lays crying
Cause she knows how my heart is ripped in two
I'm torn between the things that I should do
She deserves it all and I'd give it if I could God,her love is true
'Cause she believes in me
I'll never know just what she sees in me
I told her someday if she was my girl
I could change the world with my songs but I was wrong
But she has faith in me
And so I go on trying faithfully
Forever in my heart she will remain
And I hope and pray I will find a way, find a way
While she lays
While she lays for me
