<song artist="Ronan_Keating" title="Oxygen">
You know when you ask
Why I'm still standing here
Standing here with you
You know my reply is always kinder dear
What else would I do?
So fold in your wings
Pull up your landing gear
And have me back for keeps
You're mad if you think
I'd abandon you and me
Not in love with you 'cause I want to be
It's not up to me, you know
I'm in love with you 'cause I have to be
You're my oxygen, you're my oxygen
You're my oxygen and I breathe you in
(Whoa)
So time and again, through thick and thin
I spin and orbit back to you
Like the beat in my chest is my GPS
Knows best on how to find you
So give a little credit and you gratitude
Show a little love 'cause I hold my breath for you
So fill up my lungs and watch
The world that's come right into view
Not in love with you 'cause I want to be
It's not up to me, you know
I'm in love with you 'cause I have to be
You're my oxygen, you're my oxygen
You're my oxygen and I breathe you in
(Whoa)
Fill up my lungs and let me come alive, come alive
Fill up my lungs and let me breathe back into you
Fill up my lungs and let me come alive, come alive
Fill up my lungs and let me breathe back into you
Fill up my lungs and let me come alive, come alive
Fill up my lungs and let me breathe back into you
Back into you, back into you, back into you
Not in love with you 'cause I want to be
It's not up to me, you know
I'm in love with you 'cause I have to be
You're my oxygen, you're my oxygen
Not in love with you 'cause I want to be
It's not up to me, you know
I'm in love with you 'cause I have to be
You're my oxygen, you're my oxygen
You're my oxygen and I breathe you in
(Whoa)
Fill up my lungs and let me come alive, come alive
Fill up my lungs and let me breathe back into you
