<song artist="Ronan_Keating" title="On_My_Way">
I'm on my way yeah
The rain won't catch you and the wind won't blow
Where you're goin' no one knows and
It's alright now
Clouds are forming in a neon sky
You wonder how, you wonder why I
I'm on my way
If we knew the end would we start at all
See the pride before the fall and
It's over now
You can't break up what you can't break down
Life can sometimes spin you round and
I'm on my way
I'm on my way yeah
*Chorus*
'Cause my priority yeah, is no more you and me
The world will always turn beneath our feet yeah
My philosophy, has overtaken me
There's nothin' left to say
There's nothin' left to say
There's a hole in your heart where the rain gets in
So you pull up your collar and you start again and
I'm on my way
I'm on my way yeah
*Music*
My philosophy yeah (my philosophy) 
Has overtaken me (has overtaken me)
There's nothin' left to say
There's nothin' left to say
You watch her leaving on the evening train
You know she won't be back again and
It's alright now
There is no right, there is no wrong
You live your life, keep movin' on and
I'm on my way
I'm on my way yeah 
I'm on my way (oh, I'm on my way)
I'm on my way
I'm on my way yeah, I'm on my way yeah
I'm on my way yeah, I'm on my way
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
I'm on my way yeah, I'm on my way eee-hee-yeah
'Cause my priority yeah, has overtaken me
'Cause my philosophy, is no more you and me
I'm on my way yeah
Yeah
