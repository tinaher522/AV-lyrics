<song artist="Ronan_Keating" title="Hold_You_Now">
If I could just hold you now 
If I could just feel you now 
I wouldn't be standing out in the rain 
Pounding my heart back through my brain 
If I could just hold you now 
If I could just get inside 
If I could just read your mind 
I wouldn't be shaking this hard tonight 
Wouldn't be choking back all this pride 
If I could just hold you now 
How many times can we try to keep this grace of love alive 
How many tears can I tell you all the things you need to hear 
If I could just hold you now 
If I could just feel you now 
I wouldn't be standing out in the rain 
Pounding my heart back through my brain 
If I could just hold you now 
Ain't it funny how we had it all 
Ain't it funny how it might fall 
Guess that we're just ...
But it felt so real, it felt so right 
If I could just hold you now 
If I could just feel you now 
I wouldn't be shaking this hard tonight 
Wouldn't be choking back all this pride 
If I could just hold you now 
How many times can we try to keep this grace of love alive 
How many tears can I tell you all the things you need to hear 
If I could just hold you now 
If I could just feel you now 
I wouldn't be standing out in the rain 
Pounding my heart back through my brain 
If I could just hold you now 
Woah, if I could just hold you 
Woah, yes I should've told you 
If I could just hold you now 
If I could just feel you now 
I wouldn't be standing out in the rain 
Pounding my heart back through my brain 
If I could just hold you now
