<song artist="Ronan_Keating" title="In_Love_There_Is_No_Pride">
I was full of
Simple dreams, yeah
Thought I'd find her
And be with her full time
She's not mine,
Thought I'd find
A name with mine
4:00 am on Monday morning
And I can't get you
Out of my head
At all, should I call
Hearts gonna
Fall in love again
CHORUS:
With love
There is no pride
Should've been strong
Taking changes on
Love isn't wrong
There's nowhere
Left to hide,
Wrong or right
Could it be that
I hold you
I was never one
To beg at all
But I'm dying here for
All of your love
Repeat chorus
And all these thoughts
Race through my head
Will it be, that
I'll never have
Your touch,
Your feel
You near to me
Will it ever be
Oh
Repeat chorus
</song>
