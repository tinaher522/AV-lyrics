<song artist="Ronan_Keating" title="Time_For_Love">
We've got time to climb a mountain
The time to build a wall
But the time we finally build it
The wall has already fallen
But girl it's me and not time to blame
That you don't have my last name
Lets find the time for love
We need the time for us
We've got time to cross the oceans
The time to fight a war
By the time we finish fighting
We forgot what we were dying for
So many good have lost their lives
Why can't we put away the knives
And find the time for love
We need the time for us
I had a strange feeling
When I held you last night
I could feel you were slipping away
If you give me one chance
I'll make the wrong I've done right
But give me one more day
I'll find the time for love
We need the time for us
I had this strange feeling
When I held you last night
I could feel you were slipping away
If you give me one chance
I'll make the wrong I've done right
But give me one more day
But give me one more day
We need one more day
