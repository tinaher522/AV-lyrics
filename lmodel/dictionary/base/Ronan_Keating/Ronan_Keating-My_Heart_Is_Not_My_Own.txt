<song artist="Ronan_Keating" title="My_Heart_Is_Not_My_Own">
Oh,oh, yeah,
Oh yeah,
Underneath it all was everything I did not say,
All the scenes I've pulled was me just trying to find my way,
Just putting on a show, but in the light of day,
I see it all, it's crystal clear, what I needed most
Was waiting all along right here
Baby my love goes on,
Choices I made were wrong,
You are where I belong,
You're all I've got, my heart is not my own.
Not my own
Almost gave up hope of ever finding peace of mind,
Almost lost my soul, seeking what I could not find.
Chasing things I knew could never satisfy my heart,
I left my heart, I left my life, I left my senses
And I drove all night

Baby my love goes on,
Choices I made were wrong,
You are where I belong,
You're all I've got, my heart is not my own.
Not my own
I left my home, I left my life, I left my senses
And I drove all night,
I see it now, it's crystal clear, what I needed most
Was right here, right here
Baby my love goes on,
Choices I made were wrong,
You are where I belong,
You're all I've got, my heart is not my own
Baby my love goes on
Choices I made were wrong,
You are where I belong,
You're all I've got, my heart is not my own.
Baby, baby, yeah baby..... (fade)
