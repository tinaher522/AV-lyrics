<song artist="Ronan_Keating" title="Lost_For_Words">
If I can't find the words...
Waiting for this
Feeling in and out
Drowning in to subside
You make me 
Swim like a beginner
Like I'm new at life
And all these words
Don't come easy
No, they always seem to stop
There is an awkward silence
Yeah, anytime we talk
Oooooh but I wanna let you in
I wanna ease all your doubts
I keep trying to get it out
But if I can't find the words
To tell you what I'm feeling
Baby that don't mean
It don't mean that I don't feel it
I'm trying to tell you girl
But if you don't believe
Just look and see
my face says what you mean to me
when I can't find the words
I know
I can send you flowers
To try to make my feelings clear
And girl
I can hold you tight for hours
I wanna tell you what you're trying to hear
Oooh and I wanna let you in
I wanna ease all your doubts
I keep trying to get it out
But if I can't find the words
To tell you what I'm feeling
Baby that don't mean
It don't mean that I don't feel it
I'm trying to tell you girl
But if you don't believe
Just look and see
my face says what you mean to me
when I can't find the words
Girl I know sometimes I leave you so upset
Cos I got all these bits and pieces in my head
I know I'm puzzling
as I struggle with the things that I haven't said
When I can't find the words
When I can't find the words 
When I, when I
When I can't find the words
I wanna ease all your doubts (ease all your doubts)
keep trying to get it out
When if I can't find the words
To tell you what I'm feeling
Baby that don't mean
It don't mean that I don't feel it
I'm trying to tell you girl
But if you don't believe
Just look and see
My smile says what you mean to me
When I can't find the words 
When if I can't find the words
To tell you what I'm feeling
Baby that don't mean
It don't mean that I don't feel it
I wanna tell you girl
But if you don't believe
Just look and see
My smile says what you mean to me 
(My smile says what you mean to me)
When I can't find the words
