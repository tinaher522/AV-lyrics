<song artist="Ronan_Keating" title="She_Gets_Me_Inside">
Here's a song for the maker
Maybe the rest are just display
Here's my heart, go on, take it
For one night or just walk away
There's one heart (one heart)
And one voice (one voice)
There's one song (one song)
And one choice (one choice)
Ooh..
*Chorus*
She gets me inside
So I don't know wrong from right
And it all goes quiet
'Cause everything, everything, everything 
Is gonna be alright
Sometimes love can make ya feel good
Sometimes love treats you like nothin' should
Sometimes your heart's where your feet have stood
Nothin's gonna change, and nothin' could
But with one heart (one heart)
And one hope (one hope)
One night (one night) 
And the search is over
Ooh..
She gets me inside
So I don't know wrong from right
And it all goes quiet
'Cause everything, everything, everything
Is gonna be alright
She gets me inside
So I don't know wrong from right
And it all goes quiet
'Cause everything, everything, everything 
'Cause everything, everything, everything
Is gonna be alright
It's gonna be yeah, alright
It's gonna be yeah, alright
