<song artist="Ronan_Keating" title="The_Best_Of_Me">
Every time you cross my mind
I catch my breath and sigh
And every memory that we shared
Still lives deep inside
Just like a ship without an ocean
Like a sun without a sky
(Chorus)
You were the best of me
I swear you were the best of me
And since you're gone
There's nothing left in me
My love you were the best of me
And when I close my eyes,
I see you there
Every night you come to me
Your touch so soft and sweet
We leave this world so far behind
But only in my dreams
Somebody stole the stars from my sky
Oh won't you please come return to me
(Chorus)
You were the best of me
I swear you were the best of me
And since you're gone
There's nothing left in me
My love you were the best of me
And when I close my eyes,
I see you there
As I see you there,
Will I see you again, will I see you again
Somebody stole the stars from my sky
Oh won't you please return to me
(Chorus)
You were the best of me
I swear you were the best of me
And since you're gone
There's nothing left in me
My love you were the best of me
And when I close my eyes,
I see you there
