<song artist="Ronan_Keating" title="I_Got_My_Heart_On_You">
OH OH OH OH Yeah
Oh Baby (Oh baby)
Everybody got their heart on something
I got my heart on you
Oh Baby
And everybody got their card on someone
I got my love on you
Oh Sugar
In this world of hypocrisies
people learn from their tendencies
they wanna be free, they wanna be free
take a look at my heart girl
and look outside
people don't even stop to tell you the time
don't that tell you something (don't that tell you something)
I aint gonna beg you
I feel the way I feel
ahhhhhh
baby this is real (real)
Cause everybody got their heart on something
I got my heart on you
Oh Baby
And everybody got their card on someone
I got my love on you
Oh Sugar
In this world of unfaithfulness
its only you girl I want to kiss
I'll never be free, unless you're with me
take a look at my girl
and look outside
when I'm with you girl, God I feel alive
can I tell you something, girl it's you or nothing
cause every night I'm dreaming
of making love to you
ahhhhh let's make this dream come true
[chorus]
cause everybody got the cards
everybody got the heart
girl let's not fight no more
girl let's not fight this no more
let's do something wild
like making a child
dance thru the night my love
one look in your eyes and I'm paralyzed
you're God's gift to myÂ ??
[chorus]
