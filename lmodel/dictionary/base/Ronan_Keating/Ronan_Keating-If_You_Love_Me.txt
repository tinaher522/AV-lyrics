<song artist="Ronan_Keating" title="If_You_Love_Me">
Wish I could tell by the look in your eyes (where I stand)
Wish I could tell what you're feeling inside (but I can't)
Wish you would say what I'm needing to hear (you want me)
Give me a sign that would make it all clear (just show me)
Don't leave my heart out here on the line
If you love me let me know
So all of me can just let go
You can have me heart and soul
If you love me..then just let me know
You let me think that I don't have a chance (none at all)
You turn away when I capture your glance (should I fall)
And then you say you've been dreamin' of me (every night)
the way you talk its a complete mystery (am I right )
And I don't know what I should believe
CHORUS
I wanna give you what you need
I wanna be there in your dreams
You gotta show me tthat you want it as much as I do
Wish I could tell by the look in your eyes
Don't leave my heart out here on the line
CHORUS
