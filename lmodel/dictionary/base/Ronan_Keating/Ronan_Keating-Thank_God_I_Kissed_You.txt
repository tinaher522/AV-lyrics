Uh uh high yeah 
Da na na na na
Ah ha yeah
Yeah 
Yeah it's 4 am and the earth stands still
The city's took a sleeping pill
But I'm awake and lying next to you yeah
So it's 4 am and I breathe you in
And old familiar thoughts begin
I'd hate to think without what I'd do (ohhhhh)
Well I could have turned left
And you could have turned right
I could have stayed at home that night
And you you might have never caught that train, for the rain
Well if you hadn't smiled and if I hadn't asked
We could have been two ships that passed
And I might have never known your name
Thank god I kissed you, that I kissed you
Was it all just chance
Was it meant to be
Was it in the stars for you and me
There's a million doors, but just one key ohhh oh oh
It can take one touch 
It can take one look
Well our whole life's a storybook
And we are just fulfilling destiny 
Ohhhhhhh
Well I could have turned left
And you could have turned right
I could have stayed at home that night
And you you might have never caught that train, for the rain
Well if you hadn't smiled and if I hadn't asked
We could have been two ships that passed
And I might have never known your name
Thank god I kissed you, that I kissed you
Thank god I kissed you
That I touched you
That I met you, now I love you
Well I'm hooked on you and without you I'm insane
Well I could have turned left
And you could have turned right
I could have stayed at home that night
And you you might have never caught that train, for the rain
Well if you hadn't smiled and if I hadn't asked
We could have been two ships that passed
And I might have never known your name
And thank god I kissed you
Thank god I kissed you
Thank god I kissed you
Cause I could have missed you
Thank god that I kissed you
That I touched you
That I met you , now I love you
Thank god I kissed you
Thank god I kissed you yeah
