<song artist="Ronan_Keating" title="(We_Just_Need)_Time">
We just need time, we just need time
I beg to kiss your heart your hand,
To kiss your mouth
I pray you'll look me in the eye and
Share your doubts
I broke your heart a thousand times
Let's work this out please
I let you down but now I see without you
There's no me.
We just need time babe our love is getting
Back on track
We just need time babe I promise
I'm gonna get you back
Give me a sign girl I'm having a
Double heart attack.
I've hit the town with all my friends
But they're no help
I need to find a way to prove there's
No one else
If you don't take me back I'll spend my
Life by myself
I believe in you, believe in me there's
Nothing we can't be
We just need time babe our love is getting
Back on track
We just need time babe I promise
I'm gonna get you back
Give me a sign I'm staying and baby
That's a fact.
Cos I know we improve but I need you to see
That baby you're coming with me.
We just need time our love is getting
Back on track
We just need time babe I promise
I'm gonna win you back
Give me a sign girl I'm having a
Triple heart attack
We just need time babe our love is getting
Back on track
We just need time babe I promise
I'm gonna get you back
Give me a sign girl it's there and baby
That's a fact
We just need time.
