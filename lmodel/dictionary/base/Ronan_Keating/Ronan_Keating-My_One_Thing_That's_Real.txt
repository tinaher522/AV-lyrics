<song artist="Ronan_Keating" title="My_One_Thing_That's_Real">
I hope you feel
The same way I feel
My one thing that's real
And I pray your mine
To the end of time
Thank god you're alive
In this world of pain
You've never changed
You're sun through the rain
And world look at us
We've got an everlasting love
And I know there's a god above
Because he sent you
This is our life there's no time to fight
You're my guiding light
And world look at us
We've got an everlasting love
And I know there's a god above
Because he sent you
And I hope you feel
The same way I feel
My one thing that's real
