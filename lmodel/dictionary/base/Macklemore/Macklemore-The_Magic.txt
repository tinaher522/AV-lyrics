<song artist="Macklemore" title="The_Magic">
And then I remembered the magic,
forgot that you can't plant it.
It's always there in front of us
just trust and it happens.
And the star dust from the universe of this planet
I just get stressed when I try to understand it.
And I remember the magic,
forgot that you can't plant it.
It's always there in front of us
just trust and it happens.
And the star dust from the universe of this planet
It's always there, you can't try to understand it.
Now, I don't know why this world is a trip
see, I just float by hoping that I can live.
With a pen I'm so high, using this medicine
I got a little bit of it to give
come on hear me now.
My momma says the trip inside of you gon' hear it child.
We all got it, if you want it gotta get it out.
I know you know what I'm talking about
See it's the music from the magic, got me on top of these clouds, come on
Keep it poppin' with my favorite song
There's no feeling like the city walking with my walkman on
It gets to me, giving me goosebumps and I'm gone,
and when I die just make sure that I got my pen and headphones on.
In good times and upsets, 
rain, hail, beats, sand, heat, land, and a lot of damn sunsets.
They say that you can never capture the moment 
photograph or record it, but I swear I can when I bump them.
As I bear witness to existence setting in the distance
For a sheer instance I become one with it
Dismeant up to ten when I listen like I was set on this mission
places I've been when I with them
I'm feeling the most high when I got my pen snd I'm scriptin'
No engines speakin as I enter religion.
No crosses, pews, prayers, or repentance for sinning
just the RCA jack, a sentence and a vision.
Inside of the gut, time with the cut, right from the plug
that feeling that goes right into us. 
Instead of bump live, but with eyes wide
church you got some fire and a lighter on my fire and uh
depending on the month, sometimes I feel high with just pen and pad
if the gab, the light's within us.
I can apply my touch on the mic stand and bust
to the whole planet, and my headphones on 
And to the magic
forgot that you can't plan it.
It's always there in front of us
just trust and it happens.
And the star dust from the universe of this planet
I just get stressed when I try to understand it
And I remember the magic,
forgot that you can't plan it.
It's always there in front of us
just trust and it happens.
And the star dust from the universe of this planet
It's always there, you can't try to understand it.
(Speaking)
Have you ever done hallucinogenics?
Children don't get it twisted, I'm not reccomending.
(Rapping)
But it's not fried brains and hippies and kids jumpin' off buildings
It can be spiritual epiphanies and medicine.
Now I first tried shrooms when I was 16,
and the universe became more interesting.
I began to contemplate my place in this landscape
and reflect on what it meant to be a human being.
What I went through felt as though I dreamt it. 
Through my experience, became aware of my breath, then
began to cultivate my art with the intention of the heart,
started to use my sentences as reflections.
And what I saw was God was in all of us and we all come to be interconnected.
And all that was depended on all of us
and had effects like a domino when you let it.
Go with the flow, that the universe holds.
Understand that there's more than you expected.
I don't do shrooms anymore 'cause I don't need to explore.
All that I was looking for was was the present.
And I remember the magic,
forgot that you can't plan it.
It's always there in front of us
just trust and it happens.
And the star dust from the universe of this planet
I just get stressed when I try to understand it.
And I remember the magic,
forgot that I can't plan it.
It's always there in front of us
just trust and it happens.
And the star dust from the universe of this planet
It's always there, you can't try to understand it.
