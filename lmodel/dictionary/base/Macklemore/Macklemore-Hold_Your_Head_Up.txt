<song artist="Macklemore" title="Hold_Your_Head_Up">
Hold your head up, there's a light in the sky
I know you're fed up, but you must try to survive
Each moment's precious, don't let life pass you by
Keep focused, keep your eyes on the prize
(x2)
A friend of mine once told me
We have many paths in this journey
They act in different directions
So when you question don't be worried
It's not a wrong one
Beauty can be found in all of them
You'll meet people whose paths intersect
But you don't know how long you'll walk with them
Cos the truth is, and it's so hard, but you'll never know
How long we'll continue with our loved ones down this rugged road
The path veers and it's clear that we must steer alone
I've learned if you can't hold on to that moment that exists--
Let it go
Cos freedom is god
Freedom is acknowledging the mask you have on
And possessing the strength to take it off
Freedom is accepting every step of the path
And when it's hard having faith in the ability to embrace that
That's where you are
And this is it
The same shit that we work towards, but go against in the same sense
My friend hit me to some game and truth unravelled, she said
"the brighter the light, the darker the shadow"
And since i'm on cliche terms, knowing is half the battle
But i don't know
So i just go with what was destined
Life can be a burden or a blessing
The choice is yours to be connected
It's there if you want it, you got it, now let it
Hold your head up, there's a light in the sky
I know you're fed up, but you must try to survive
Each moment's precious, don't let life pass you by
Keep focused, keep your eyes on the prize
(x2)
I feel like i have nothing to give right now
This is my trial, tribulations, and it must go down
But where's the up?
I'm stuck with the broken smile
No jokin' now, wantin' to grab a swish and smoke this out
The moment of a man choosing what path i will go down
Do i give in, give up, or get up and live right now?
With a split gut pick myself up and spit my style
This is the only thing that can hold my ground
You're born into this world alone and alone you'll go out
All i have is myself and everyone else i doubt
You can only trust yourself and depend on the help of the pound
Inside of the chest that beats with the breath of the now
No sunshine when she's gone, i can only see clouds
No homies can hold me down, the spirit's testing me now
But i can withstand this world, but it seems so foul
Flood of emotions, it's like i'm being held down to drown
Hell's right around the corner, but i can turn it around
You always have a choice, no matter the situation you're not bound
To nothing, no one, you're chosen for this job
This is your life, you can't escape this bitch when it's hard
Just know that it passes, but you'll collect scars
They never go away, but they will make you who you are
This is a beautiful struggle, i share it in song cos
I can't control this, remember: the moment's beyond us
Hold your head up, there's a light in the sky
I know you're fed up, but you must try to survive
Each moment's precious, don't let life pass you by
Keep focused, keep your eyes on the prize
(x2)
And all my people say whoa.. whoa.. yeah
And all my people say whoa.. whoa..
(x2)
C'mon
Hold your head up, there's a light in the sky
I know you're fed up, but you must try to survive
Each moment's precious, don't let life pass you by
Keep focused, keep your eyes on the prize
[one more time]
Hold your head up, there's a light in the sky
I know you're fed up, but you must try to survive
Each moment's precious, don't let life pass you by
Keep focused, keep your eyes on the prize
