<song artist="Omi" title="Stir_It">
Uh yeah
I know what I want
And I want it right now, right now
I know what I need
And I need right now, right now
'Cause you're looking at me
Like you thinking to do
I don't see nobody here (nobody)
But us two
We can stir it all night
Girl your body so tight
We can stir it all night
You can follow back now
Don't want nothing back now
We can stir it all night
Girl your body so tight
We can stir it all night
You can follow back now
Don't want nothing back now

I'm making you hot
I'ma give it to you right now, right now
I know what you got
And I want it right now, right now
Uh, let me put it on you, aha
'Cause I know I could do
I don't see nobody here (nobody)
But us two
We can stir it all night
Girl your body so tight
We can stir it all night
You can follow back now
Don't want nothing back now
We can stir it all night
Girl your body so tight
We can stir it all night
You can follow back now
Don't want nothing back now
Oh let me hear you say, oho
Oh let me hear you say, oho
Hey give it to me now
And let me put it on you
Yes I know what to do
Ain't nobody here (nobody)
But us two
We can stir it all night
Girl your body so tight
We can stir it all night
You can follow back now
Don't want nothing back now
We can stir it all night
Girl your body so tight
We can stir it all night
You can follow back now
Don't want nothing back now
