<song artist="Take_That" title="She_Said">
My love was filled with trouble
With indecision, therapy and pain
You know that my love
It was going no where
It would have driven any normal man insane
Oh but then she said she wanted to dance
She said she wanted to move
She said she wanted a good time
Girl, I think I love you
My love, as bad as fast food
As low as two steps in a canvas hat
You know that my love was one long hangover
Ain't got no houses or no money or no land
Oh but then she said she wanted to dance
She said she wanted to move
She said she wanted a good time
Girl, I think I love you
Shake it
(Shake it)
Everybody now shake it
(Shake it)
Everybody just step to the right
Jump up turn around and shake it
(Shake it)
Everybody now boogie
Everybody now boogie
Everybody put your hands in the air
Turn around everybody let's boogie
Oh my life, was filled with trouble
With indecision, therapy and pain
You know that my love
It was going no where
It would have driven any normal man insane
Oh but then she said she wanted to dance
She said she wanted to move
She said she wanted a good time
Girl, I think I love you
She said she wanted to dance
She said she wanted to move
She said she wanted a good time
Girl, I think I love you
