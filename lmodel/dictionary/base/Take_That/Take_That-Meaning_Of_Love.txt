<song artist="Take_That" title="Meaning_Of_Love">
Deceit and lies, is all I've taken 
Let me surface to breath 
No sacrifice, no inspiration 
Can you understand me? 
Why should I ask you, 
Why should I worry? 
You never worry about me 
Why should I ned you, 
Why don't I let you go? 
And let my heartaches run free 
I thought I knew the meaning of love 
Now I'm asking you why 
I thought I knew the meaning of love 
now open wide 
What's on my mind, so many questions 
Though the answers I can guess 
You slip away shelter from confrontation 
Look my life is such a mess 
I thought I knew the meaning of love
Now I'm asking you why 
I thought I knew the meaning of love 
now open wide
