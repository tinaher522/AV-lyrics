<song artist="Take_That" title="The_Garden">
Mark:
And the fishermen came back across the water
And the people started running in the park
And the city stopped as I held you in my arms
We could hear the sound of sirens all around us
And the scent of burning oil was in the air
And the music played and it felt so good to hear
Gary:
This is the life we've been given
So open your mind and start living
We can play a part if we only start believing
Jason:
There's a stranger on the hill and he is speaking
As the tears from every cloud begin to fall
For one moment then we understood it all
Howard:
Everyone, everyone, can you hear the soldiers coming
Everyone, everyone, every man and every women
We all fall, in the end, we're just miracles of matter
So come on
Let me love you
Gary:
This is the life we've been given
So open your mind and start living
We can play a part if we only start believing
Ouuuh
This is the life we've been given
So open your heart and start loving
We can make a start if we only learn to listen yeaaah
Mark:
Then the crowd began to head for the horizon
A million people walking back to work
But you and me, we just lay down in the garden
Yeah you and me, we just lay down in the garden
All:
This is the life we've been given
So open your mind to start living
We can play a part if we only start believing
Whoooo
This is the life we've been given
So open your heart and start loving
We can make a start if we only learn to listen yeah
Mark:
You and me, we just lay down in the garden
Yeah, The Garden
