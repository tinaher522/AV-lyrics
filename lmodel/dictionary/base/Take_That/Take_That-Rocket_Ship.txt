<song artist="Take_That" title="Rocket_Ship">
When darkness filled me
With expectation
Could not see things straight
Or find my angel
I was a lost soul
Without a road map
And out of body
Experience
Then you held out your hand
Like I hoped that you would
Saying not to let go
Don't you dare let me go
Then you asked me to stay
No way I couldn't move
Then you held me so tight
And it's making me better now
Almost human now
Made it up somehow
Played with my head
I'm feeling much better now
Won't be under now
I've got stars
Over my head
I prayed for reinvention
A final resolution
A catastrophic consequences
And solution
I was a wise man
Without a gold star
A lonely soldier
Without a cold war
Then you held out your hand
Like I hoped that you would
Saying not to let go
Don't you dare let me go
Then you asked me to stay
No way I couldn't move
Then you held me so tight
And it's making me better now
Almost human now
Made it up somehow
Played with my head
I'm feeling much better now
Won't be under now
I've got stars
Over my head
I've got you back and in my mind
Turned your mother ship back home
Like a rocket ship in the galaxy
We were back where we belong
And I'm not afraid
I haven't felt quite this way for so long now
I can't explain
Anymore
I've got you back and in my mind
Turned the mother ship back home
Like a rocket ship in the galaxy
We were back where we belong
I've got you back and in my mind
Turned the mother ship back home
Like a rocket ship in the galaxy
We were back where we belong
And it's making me better now
Almost human now
Made it up somehow
Played with my head
I've got you back and in my mind
Turned the mother ship back home
Like a rocket ship in the galaxy
We were back where we belong
I'm feeling much better now
Won't be under now
I've got stars
Over my head
I've got you back and in my mind
Turned the mother ship back home
Like a rocket ship in the galaxy
We were back where we belong
