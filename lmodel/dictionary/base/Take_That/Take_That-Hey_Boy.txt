<song artist="Take_That" title="Hey_Boy">
If you want some love
And you don't know how
Gotta tell that girl
Gotta tell her now
Gotta give her time
Gotta give her more
If you want that girl
Gotta let her know
If you want that girl
Gotta let her see
Gotta burn inside
Gotta let it be
If you want that girl
And you don't know why
Oh it only gonna drive you crazy
Don't wait for someone to change your life
Don't settle for less than you deserve
Don't waste a minute of your precious time
Don't wait for someone, go change your life
Hey boy, whatcha got?
Don't leave me on the phone, uh-oh
Don't want no trouble in the house
Hey boy, whatcha got?
Can't take this anymore, uh-oh
You might just be my hero
Get outta your head, get into your heart
Get outta your head, get into your heart
Get outta your head, get into your heart
Hey boy, whatcha got?
Hey boy, whatcha got?
Can't take this anymore, uh-oh
Don't want no trouble in the house
If you want some love
But you can't say why
Gotta tell that boy
Gotta hold him tight
Gotta let him know
Gotta let it show
Gotta hope the feeling grows
If you want that guy
Gotta let him see
Gotta turn his head
Turn up the heat
If you want that guy
Gotta make him yours
Your heart's beating and it won't stop, baby
Hey boy, whatcha got?
Don't leave me on the phone, uh-oh
Don't want no trouble in the house
Hey boy, whatcha got?
Can't take this anymore, uh-oh
You might just be my hero
Get outta your head, get into your heart
Get outta your head, get into your heart
Get outta your head, get into your heart
Hey boy, whatcha got?
Hey boy, whatcha got?
Can't take this anymore, uh-oh
Don't want no trouble in the house
Don't wait for someone to change your life
Don't settle for less than you deserve
Don't waste a minute of your precious time
Don't wait for someone, go change your life
Hey boy, whatcha got?
Don't leave me on the phone, uh-oh
Don't want no trouble in the house
Hey boy, whatcha got?
Can't take this anymore, uh-oh
You might just be my hero
Get outta your head, get into your heart
Get outta your head, get into your heart
Get outta your head, get into your heart
Hey boy, whatcha got?
Hey boy, whatcha got?
Can't take this anymore, uh-oh
Don't want no trouble in the house
