<song artist="Take_That" title="Hold_On">
Mark:
We've been here many times before
Leaving rooms and slamming doors
We're climbing up the bedroom walls
Sometimes we make it so frustrating
I touch your mouth, I touch your lips
The answers at our fingertips
Not giving up or giving in
Why are we so complicated?
Oh tell me what to say, tell me
To make it all okay, yeah
I don't wanna see you hurting
Just hold on
Just hold on to me
I don't wanna see you crying
So hold on
So hold on to me, to me
Hold on to me.
I'm trying to think of what to do
To really make it up to you
So many truths, too many lies
Making love can be so crazy
I find myself back here again
Asking you to let me in
You know it's time, we need to change
How can we live with all these maybes?
There are no words that say, no words
To make it go away.
All:
I don't wanna see you hurting
Just hold on
Just hold on to me
I don't wanna see you crying
So hold on
So hold on to me
Mark:
'Cause baby it's alright
I'm staying here tonight
So hold on
So hold on
So hold on
Hold on
Just tell me what to say
To let you know I'll always stay.
All:
I don't wanna see you hurting
Just hold on
Just hold on to me
I don't wanna see you crying
So hold on
So hold on to me
Hold on
Hold on to Me
Hold On
Hold on
So Hold on
Hold on
