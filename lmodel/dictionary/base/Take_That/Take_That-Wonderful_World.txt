<song artist="Take_That" title="Wonderful_World">
What a wonderful world this is
What a wonderful world this is
It makes me want to kiss
What a beautiful kiss this is
What a beautiful kiss of life
Just before I die
I've been spending time
I've been losing time
Time was all we had
But it was never ours to keep
Time can help you find the ground and knock you off your feet
All those minutes get lost in time
One step forward two steps behind
So before I think myself too deep
What a wonderful world this is
What a wonderful world this is
What a delicate tale of bliss
That I don't want to miss
In this moment where we all exist
On the precipice of the abyss 
It always was, how it is
(Spending time)
I've been spending time.
(wasting time)
I've been wasting time
Time was all we had
But it was never ours to keep
Time can help you find the ground and knock you off your feet
All those minutes get lost in time
One step forward two steps behind
So before I think myself too deep
What a wonderful world this is
No time ...
Am I losing my mind
No time ...
Am I losing my mind
There's no time for us, no time for us until we're out of time
There's not time for us, not time
What a wonderful world this is
There's no time for us, not time (we're running out of time)
(Time was all we had
But it was never ours to keep)
Running out of time
(Time was all we had
But it was never ours to keep)
Running out of time
(Time was all we had
But it was never ours to keep)
Running out of time
