<song artist="Take_That" title="Don't_Take_Your_Love">
Now when I've just begun to need you 
Trying to throw everything away 
No need to tell me, know you need time 
Time for me to make you see you're always mine 
Don't take your love away from me 
Don't take your love away from me 
Oh time after time when I thought we were close 
Don't take your love away from me 
Everyone is telling me to leave you 
I'd love to know what you're doing now 
I'm tempted to call round i'm tempted to phone 
Just for you and me girl to be on our own 
Don't take your love away from me 
Don't take your love away from me, baby 
Don't take your love away from me 
Don't take your love away from me 
Oh time after time when I thought we were close 
Don't take your love away from me 
Every time I'm lonely and I need you 
Can I just call round and talk alone 
I'm losing my will to live and people I know are telling me I've lost you girl 
And there's no hope, so please 
Don't take your love away from me 
Don't take your love away from me 
Don't take your love away from me 
Don't take your love away from me
