<song artist="Take_That" title="Portrait">
Life slow down
You've gone too fast
And words begin to mean a little less
Bones stay strong
'Cause the road ahead is long
And every voice will miss us when we're gone
Take a portrait
25 let me hear you singing it out
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
Let me hear you singing it out
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
Skin don't stretch
It's way too new
And those who look back are only the fools
Take a portrait
25 let me hear you singing it out
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
Yeah I'm singing it out
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
Let me hear you singing it out
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
Years don't come too soon
And days be long and light
Future you can wait
'Cause time's still on our side
Take a portrait
25 let me hear you singing it out
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
Let me hear you singing it out
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
Yeah you're singing it out
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
Oh sing it out
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
You're free to come alive
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
You're free to come tonight
