<song artist="Take_That" title="Holding_Back_The_Tears">
I kind of keep asking myself little questions
Like where do I go from here
I seem to keep losing track of time and how long it's been
Since I last had you near
Been a painful road to a door that's closed
Been a gamble that I knew I couldn't win
Been a lonely conversation to this photograph of you
In the mirror there's a sign I must give in
So I'm not holding back the tears anymore
Tryin' to escape the heartache, tryin' to escape emotion (escape emotion)
No I'm not holding back the tears anymore
Yesterday's my memory reminding me of all the times
That I depended on you
I used to enjoy spending time on my own here
Watching the jaded people pass
Now here I am sharing their pain and their lonely tears (their lonely tears)
And walking a road of broken glass (it's never been easy)
It's a constant fight to get through each day and night
It's a war between the present and the past (present and the past)
And the face that's in your mind every time you close your eyes
What's the reason, what's the answer, how long will this last (no no)
So I'm not holding back the tears anymore
Tryin' to escape the heartache, tryin' to escape emotion (escape emotion)
No I'm not holding back the tears anymore
Yesterday's my memory reminding me of all the times
That I depended on you
Been a long, long time since I heard your last goodbye
Still I hear it clearly every day and night
What's the point in love when you have to give it up
Yet still you need it, and it's nowhere you can find (no no)
So I'm not holding back the tears anymore
Tryin' to escape the heartache, tryin' to escape emotion (escape emotion)
No I'm not holding back the tears anymore
Yesterday's my memory reminding me of all the times.......
