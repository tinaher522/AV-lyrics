<song artist="Take_That" title="Wasting_My_Time">
You've maybe seen me walk behind you
I follow you just everywhere you go
I've heard a whisper, they're telling me you've missed her
I know you're loving someone else instead of loving me
So I've been wasting my time
Running after you girl
Wasting my time
Still I feel a sense of love
Never be mine
You're someone else's lady
Always on my mind
That I could steal your love away 
Even now I know it doesn't change me
Maybe some day you'll be free again
Till then remember babe
I won't surrender, still hurts me when
I know you're loving someone else instead of loving me
So I've been wasting my time
Running after you girl
Wasting my time
Still I feel a sense of love
Never be mine
You're someone else's lady
Always on my mind
That I would steal your love away
You said that you've been missing me,
But how can that be girl, how can that be girl.
Now all our plans that used to be are passing us by
You say I wanna be free.
