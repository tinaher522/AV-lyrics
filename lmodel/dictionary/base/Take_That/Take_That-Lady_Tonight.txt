(I got this thing for you to make you feel alright
I got this thing for you to make you feel alright
I got this thing for you to make you feel alright
Will it happen tonight?  I think it just might) 
x 4
The night is feeling cold now
And I must hold now my baby date
So glad to see you fine you're always on my mind
But before it gets too late
We'll try love (we'll try love), but if love is not enough
Then we can take a little walk
Just to find (we can find) if our intentions are in time
Then I will make you baby see that
Lady tonight we are gonna make it happen
Lady tonight I'm gonna take this love to new heights
Lady tonight we are gonna feel emotion
Maybe tonight girl I'm gonna love you and hold you tight
Life is what you make it you must shake it to make it right (shake, shake your life)
Time will always make you see (make you see) if you believe (if you believe)
Then things will be alright (will be alright)
We'll try love (try love) and if love is not enough
We must be destined to be free
In time (in time) if you feel like giving up
Then I must make you baby see that
Lady tonight we are gonna make it happen
Lady tonight I'm gonna take this love to new heights
Lady tonight we are gonna feel emotion
Maybe tonight girl I'm gonna love you and hold you tight
I got this thing for you to make you feel alright
Will it happen tonight?  I think it just might
It's not like I wanna rush you
I just wanna do the things that lovers do
Tonight I'll love you and hold you tightly
I'll make sure I give good feeling rightly
and when it happens
we'll do it again and again until.......well.....
We'll find love
but if love is not enough
then I can make you baby see
I can make you baby see...
Lady tonight we are gonna make it happen
Lady tonight I'm gonna take this love to new heights
Lady tonight cause we are gonna feel emotion
Maybe tonight girl I'm gonna love you and hold you tight
