<song artist="Take_That" title="Hanging_Onto_Your_Love">
Hanging on, hanging on, hanging on, hanging on
Hanging on, hanging onto your love
Hanging on, hanging on, hanging onto your love
Hanging on, hanging on, hanging onto your love
Hanging onto your love, I need it
Can we talk, thoughout the night I need you so bad 
 And when we talk can you understand my feelings 
 And understand it hurts to be without you 
 Never prepared, never know what's going wrong 
 I'm loosing though, I always thought this love was so strong 
 So alone, so lost in the dark, 
 So hurt, cause you will always have a place in my heart 
 Hangin' onto your love 
 Hangin' onto your love 
 Hangin' onto your love 
 Hangin' onto your love, I need it 
 Let's take a walk and reminisce about 
 The feelings we used to feel 
 Just stay the word and I'll be back for good my baby 
 I'll be back to give you girl what you deserve 
 Don't say too much, did I try to rule your life 
 Did the love we had between us 
 Miss the road to paradise 
 Can we try again, can we chance it one more time 
 Can the ecstasy we found here 
 Be re-claimed as yours and mine 
 Hangin' onto your love 
 Hangin' onto your love 
 Hangin' onto your love 
 Hangin' onto your love
