<song artist="Take_That" title="Mancunian_Way">
We used to walk Mancunian Way
We used to swagger we used to sway
Up until the lights took us away
Do you know what you meant to me?
We used to think we were the bomb
Then someone left a real one
We stayed indoors as the rain come
Back then it made no sense to me
I'm missing you face, your beautiful face
It's funny that I recall they gave us the keys to the city, 
but they don't fit anything
But I'm coming anyway.
I hear you calling
I came back running
Forgot that feeling
Been so long coming
They tried to stop her
She just got stronger
I'm driving home again
Back down Mancunian Way
I just forgot how it is to feel
To dance and move and keep it real
Been lying down for ten long years
But I was there and it feels like yesterday
I'm missing you face, your beautiful face
It's funny that I recall you came when I was pretty, but that don't work no more
But I'm coming anyway.
I hear you calling
I came back running
Forgot that feeling
Been so long coming
They tried to stop her
She just got stronger

I'm driving home again
Back down Mancunian Way
Now I stand here in front of you
I know now what I'm gonna do
My shoulders low, but my head is high
I'm gonna bring this town alive
Through this acidic rain
I'm gonna come back to life again.
I hear you calling
I came back running
Forgot that feeling
Been so long coming
They tried to stop her
She just got stronger
I'm driving home again
Back down Mancunian Way
I hear you calling
I came back running
Forgot that feeling
Been so long coming
They tried to stop her
She just got stronger
I'm driving home again
Back down Mancunian Way
I hear you calling
I came back running
Forgot that feeling
Been so long coming
They tried to stop her
She just got stronger
I'm driving home again
Back down Mancunian Way
