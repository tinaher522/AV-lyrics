Gary:
Today this could be, the greatest day of our lives
Before it all ends, before we run out of time
Stay close to me, stay close to me
Watch the world come alive tonight
Stay close to me.
Tonight this could be the greatest night of our lives
Let's make a new start, the future is ours to find
Can you see it, can you see it in my eyes?
Can you feel it now, can you hold it in your arms tonight?
Mark:
Hold on Hold on, Hold on Hold on (Gary: Tonight)
Hold On Hold on
All:
Oh stay close to me (Hold On)
Stay close to me
Watch the world come alive tonight
Stay close to me
Ooh hold your head high, (Hold On)
Arms open wide
Yeah the world starts to come alive 
When you stay close to me
Gary:
Today this could be the greatest day of our lives
Today this could be the greatest day of our lives
Ooh and the world comes alive 
And the world comes alive 
And the world comes alive oh oh ooh
Stay close to me, hold on (All: and the world comes alive)
Stay close to me (All: and the world comes alive)
Watch the world come alive tonight stay close to me (All: Hold on)
Oh stay close to me and the would comes alive
Stay close to me and the world comes alive
Watch the world come alive tonight (All:stay close to me) oh oh ohoo
