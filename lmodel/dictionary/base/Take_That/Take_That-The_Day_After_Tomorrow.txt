<song artist="Take_That" title="The_Day_After_Tomorrow">
Only one way to describe, this is deceit I am hiding 
Never been here before, never wanna see here again 
I've strayed from a long term lover 
And found greater lust from another 
My conscience is keeping me awake and shouting at me all night 
So I'll tell her the day after tomorrow, maybe today 
So I'll tell her the day after tomorrow, or is that too late 
Beeing loved is a big responsability, 
You can never give too much back 
You know it's so easy to walk away and leave that lady flat 
My life's feeling crowded with possesions, am I lucky or sad 
Is it time to turn away and lose everything I had 
So I'll tell her the day after tomorrow, maybe today 
So I'll tell her the day after tomorrow, or is that too late 
Moving in circles, decisions chasing me round and round 
Why's life never easy, or do we make it hard for ourselves 
And when we find love we need to look for something new 
'Cos when it's all over, you always feel the need to be loved 
Like she always loved you
