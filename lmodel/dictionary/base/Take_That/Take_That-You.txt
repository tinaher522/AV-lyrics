<song artist="Take_That" title="You">
It's not a spark that gives me light 
It's not the days I'm up all night 
It's not a story I have read 
Or a picture in my head 
It's not the world that pulls me through 
It wasn't a question before I knew 
It's just an answer here by my side 
I found it out just in time 
It's you. Yeah 
It's you. It's you 
Give me your hurt if you're feeling pain 
Tell me your secrets I keep them safe 
Give me your love mixed up with sin 
Every part of every thing 
It's you. oh yeah 
It's you. It's you 
From now till the end. From now till the end. From now till the end. 
My friend. 
It's a moment of glory 
My one and only 
It's you. oh yeah 
It's you. It's you. It's you. It's you. It's you. It's you. It's you. 
Just you. Yeah. It's you. It's you. Just you. Yeah. It's you.
