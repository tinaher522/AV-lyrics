<song artist="Take_That" title="Another_Crack_In_My_Heart">
I am just one man
With just one pair of eyes
I dress in normal clothes
And I don't try to disguise
I'm looking out for love
However it may seem
I never do return
In the always-winning team
Maybe I should try to live alone ( maybe I should try )
Or raise the flag of mercy to unknown
Maybe I should run and hide away ( maybe I should run )
Until another day
Another crack in my heart
Another picture on the wall
Another way to spend an evening
When there's no one there at all
Another kiss to say goodbye
Another cross upon the chart
Another suitcase at the door
Another crack in my heart ( in my heart )
I've had my spills and thrills of love
And held it in my hand
I held on tight until it broke, and I crashed to the ground
Love cannot be on my side
It's clearer everyday
That everytime I reach for love
It always runs away
Maybe I should try to live alone ( maybe I should try )
Or raise the flag of mercy to unknown
Maybe I should run and hide away ( maybe I should run )
Until another day
( Chorus )
