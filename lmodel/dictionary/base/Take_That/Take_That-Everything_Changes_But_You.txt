Forever
Everything changes but you
We've said goodbye, the taxi cab is waiting
Now don't you cry, just one more kiss, before I have to go
Hey, girl, I know the situation changed and so much is new
But something in my life remains the same 'cause
Everything changes but you
We're a thousand miles apart but you know, I love you
Everything changes but you
You know every single day, I'll be thinkin' about you
The rumor's true, you know that there 've been others
What can I do? I tell you baby, they don't mean a thing
Now, girl don't go and throw our love away
I'll be home soon back in your arms to hear you say that
Everything changes but you
We're a thousand miles apart but you know, I love you
Everything changes but you
You know every single day, I'll be thinkin' about you, girl
Everything changes but you
We're a thousand miles apart but you know I love you, I do
Everything changes but you
I'll spend every single day thinkin' about you
Though everything changes around us
Baby, don't you cry
We will be the same as before more, forever
Everything changes but you
We're a thousand miles apart and I miss you, baby
Everything changes but you
You know every single day, I'll be thinkin' about you, girl
Everything changes but you
I'll be thinkin' about you, thinkin' about you
Everything changes but you
'Cause you know I love you, know that I love you
Everything changes but you
I'll be thinkin' about you, thinkin' about you
Everything changes but you
I love you, I love you
