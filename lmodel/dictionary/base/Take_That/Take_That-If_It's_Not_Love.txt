<song artist="Take_That" title="If_It's_Not_Love">
Before we say goodnight
Look down and call for time
Before we walk away, just think
I wish that I could say, this heart will never break
Before we start again, lets think
We felt too much to fall
Don’t bow when the curtain falls
Before we lose it all, before we lose it all
If it’s not hard enough, if it don’t hurt enough
If it’s not hard to find, if it don’t change your life
Then it’s not love
It’s never how you plan
And when you’ve lost all hope
That’s when you’ll understand
Maybe it’s my mistake
I say too much too late
‘Til we communicate, again
Don’t hide when the rain falls
If it’s easy then it can’t be loved
Before we lose it all, before we lose it all
If it’s not hard enough, if it don’t hurt enough
If it’s not hard to find, if it don’t change your life
Then it’s not love
Not love
'Cause love is never planned
Not for us to understand
'Cause love, yes love
Is all we really have
If it’s not hard enough, if it don’t hurt enough
If it’s not hard to find, if it don’t change your life
Then it’s not love
It is not hard to find
Then it’s not love
Then it’s not love
Then it’s not love
Then it’s not love
