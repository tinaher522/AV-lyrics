I WANNA HOLD YOUR HAND
Oh yeah, I'll tell you something 
I think you'll understand 
When I say that something 
I wanna hold your hand 
I wanna hold your hand 
I wanna hold your hand 
I wanna hold your hand 
Oh please say to me 
You'll let me be your man 
And please say to me 
You'll let me hold your hand 
Now let me hold your hand 
I wanna hold your hand 
And when I touch you I feel happy inside 
It's such a feeling my love I can't hide 
HARD DAYS NIGHT
It's been a hard day's night 
And I've been working like a dog 
It's been a hard days night 
I should be sleeping like a log 
You know I work all day, to get you money, to buy you things 
And it's worth it just to hear you say: 
"you are gonna give me everything" 
Why on earth should I mean, 'cause when I get you alone 
You know I feel alright 
When I'm home, everything seems to be all right 
When I'm home, feeling you holding me tight 
SHE LOVES YOU
So if you think you've lost your love, well I saw her yesterday 
It's you she's thinking of, and she told me what to say 
She says she loves you, and you know that can't be bad 
yes, she loves you and you know you should be glad 
She loves you yeah yeah yeah 
She loves you yeah yeah yeah 
She loves you yeah yeah yeah 
And with a love like that 
You know you should be glad 
I FEEL FINE
Baby's good to me you know 
She's happy as can be you, she said so 
I'm in love with her and I feel fine 
Baby says she's mine you know, 
She tells me all the times you know, she said so 
I'm in love with her and I feel fine 
I'm so glad that she's my little girl 
She's so glad, she's telling all the world 
That her baby buys her thing you know 
He buys her diamond things you know, 
She said so 
She's in love with me and I feel fine 
GET BACK
Jojo was a man who thought he was a loner 
But he knew it couldn't last 
Jojo left his home in Tugson, Arizona 
For some Californian grass 
Get back 
Get back 
Get back 
To where you once belonged 
Sweet Loretta Martin thought she was a woman 
But she was another man 
all the girls around her said she's got it coming 
But gets it while she can 
Get back 
Get back 
Get back 
To where you once belonged 
HEY JUDE
Hey Jude, don't make it bad, 
Take a sad song and make it better 
Remember to let her into your heart 
Then you can start to make it better 
Hey Jude, don't be afraid, 
You were made to go out and get her 
The minute you let her under your skin 
Then you begin to make it better 
Any time you feel the pain, hey Jude refrain, 
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders 
Now you know that's a fool who plays it cool 
By making his world a little colder 
nanananana hey Jude
