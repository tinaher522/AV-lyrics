<song artist="Take_That" title="What_You_Believe_In">
Ooooooooooooooooooooooooo............
What am I to you and what are you to me?
Are we getting better or did we used to be?
What of the songs we used to sing?
Where are the souls we used to carry in?
What is a sail without a hurricane?
What is a hurt without someone to blame?
Show me the sky and I climb the stairs
Give me something 'cause I'm losing it.
Give me what it is you belive in
'Cause i give to you my truth
I got all my faith in you
I don't know which way we are going
Doesn't matter anyway
Just as long as you will stay.
Tell me the word and I'll shout it out
For what is a voice when in doubt?
The world has changed
The world will change
Oh give me something 'cause I need to feel.
Give me what it is you belive in

'Cause i give to you my truth
I got all my faith in you
I don't know which way we are going
Doesn't matter anyway
Just as long as you will stay.
It's all good you know
I still love you so
And you don't have to do this on you own.
No No
Give me what it is you belive in
'Cause i give to you my truth
I got all my faith in you
I don't know which way we are going
Doesn't matter anyway
Just as long as you will stay.
Give me what it is you belive in
'Cause i give to you my truth
I got all my faith in you
I don't know which way we are going
Doesn't matter anyway
Just as long as you will stay.
