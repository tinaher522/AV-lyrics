<song artist="Take_That" title="Butterfuly">
For once in my life I couldn't deny
I thought that I'd found my everything,
A lover a friend,
The hours we would spend just doing nothing at all,
Yeah, but your need to leave is your so long,
Break free let go
Butterfly fly, fly away from here
I know we'll try, try through the laughter and the tears
You'll always be a part of me
In my heart you'll always be
Butterfly fly, fly away, fly away
Deep in your eyes the stare that I find
All that I really ever need.
Whatever I do you know that its you girl In every face I see.
Your last goodbye was your so long break free let go,
Butterfly fly, fly away from here
I know we'll try, try through the laughter and the tears
You'll always be a part of me
In my heart you'll always be
Butterfly fly, fly away, fly away
To the place you belong hope you heal the fear and soul
Hope that you can find the freedom in your life, in your life
Ah sweet butterfly, just fly away, just fly away
I know we'll try, try through the laughter and the tears
You'll always be a part of me
In my heart you'll always be
Butterfly fly, fly away, fly away
For once in my life I couldn't deny,
I thought that I'd found my everything,
A lover a friend,
The hours we would spend just doing nothing at all
