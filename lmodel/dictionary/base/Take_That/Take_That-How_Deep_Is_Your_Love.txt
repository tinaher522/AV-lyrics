<song artist="Take_That" title="How_Deep_Is_Your_Love">
And when you rise in the morning sun
I feel you touch me in the pouring rain
And the moment that you wander far from me
I wanna feel you in my arms again
And you come to me on a summer breeze
Keep me warm in your love
Then you softly leave
And its me you need to show
How deep is your love?
How deep is your love?
I really need to learn
Cos were living in a world of fools
Breaking us down when they
All should let us be
We belong to you and me
I believe in you
You know your the door to my very soul
You're the light in my deepest, darkest hour
My savior when I fall
And you may not think that I care for you
When you know down inside
That I really do
And It's me you really need to show
How deep is your love?
How deep is your love?
I really meant to learn
Cos were living in a world of fools
Breaking us down when they
All should let us be
We belong to you and me
