Mark:
You, 
You're such a big star to me
You're everything I wanna be
But you're stuck in a hole 
And I want you to get out
I don't know what there is to see
But I know it's time for you to leave
We're all just pushing along
Trying to figure it out, out, out
All your anticipation pulls you down
When you can have it all, 
You can have it all
So come on.
So come on, get it on
I don't know what you're waiting for
Your time is coming don't be late, hey hey
So come on
See the light on your face
Let it shine
Just let it shine
Let it shine
Stop (stop) 
Being so hard on yourself
It's not good for your health
I know that you can change
So clear your head and come 'round
You only have to open your eyes
You might just get a big surprise
And it may feel good 
And you might want to smile, smile, smile
Don't you let your demons pull you down
'Cause you can have it all 
You can have it all
So come on
Oh come on, get it on
I don't know what you're waiting for
Your time is coming don't be late, hey hey
So come on
See the light on your face
Let it shine
Just let it shine
Let it shine
(Hey)
Hey 
(Let me know ya)
Let me know ya
(You're all that matters to me)
You're all that matters to me
(Hey)
(Let me show ya)
Let me show ya
(You're all that matters to me)
You're all that matters to me
So come on, get it on
I don't know what you're waiting for
Your time is coming don't be late, hey hey
So come on
See the light on your face
Let it shine
Just let it shine
Let it shine
(Hey)
(Let me know ya)
Let me know ya
(You're all that matters to me)
You're all that matters to me
(Hey)
(Let me show ya)
Let me show ya
(You're all that matters to me)
You're all that matters
(Shine)
Hey (Let me love ya) 
(Shine)
Let me love ya
(Shine)
(You're all that matters to me)
(Shine)
Oh come on 
See the light on your face
Let it shine
Just let it shine
(Shine all your light over me)
Shine
