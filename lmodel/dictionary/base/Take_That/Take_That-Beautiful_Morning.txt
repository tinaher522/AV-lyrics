<song artist="Take_That" title="Beautiful_Morning">
Day through my window,
Sunlight's breaking through my eyes.
I'm still sleeping,
Dreaming for the band to play.
I can hear it, yeah,
I can feel it in my soul,
Like a rocket
In the sky.
It's a beautiful morning [A beautiful day]
It's a beautiful place for us to start,
A beautiful morning [A beautiful day]
A beautiful way to loose your heart.
Doo dooo doo doo
Doo dooo doo doo
Time flies, the sun shines,
Behind me forgiveness everywhere.
I am breathing believing
The love is always there.
Can you feel it? Yeah,
Can you feel it in the air?
Like a rocket
I'm so high.
It's a beautiful morning [A beautiful day]
It's a beautiful place for us to start,
A beautiful morning [A beautiful day]
A beautiful way to loose your heart.
Just the day to take it easy on yourself, my friend,
Just the day to say I think of no one else but you.
Doo dooo doo doo
Doo dooo doo doo
Doo dooo doo doo
Doo dooo doo doo
Oh, can you feel it? Yeah,
Can you feel it touching down?
Like a rocket
On the moon.
It's a beautiful morning
A beautiful place for us to start.
A beautiful morning
A beautiful way to loose your heart.
It's a beautiful morning [A beautiful day]
It's a beautiful place for us to start,
A beautiful morning [A beautiful day]
What a beautiful way to loose your heart.
Doo dooo doo doo
Doo dooo doo doo]
What a beautiful beautiful morning,
What a beautiful beautiful day,
What a beautiful beautiful morning,
Yeah.
