Get ready for it
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Get ready for it
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)
You said whatever you put out there
Whatever you put out there is gonna come back
You said whenever you are ready
Whenever you are ready just let it all out
And I know 'cause the enemy inside me
'Cause the enemy inside me is holding me back
But we know there's something in the silence
There's something inside the silence
Get ready for it
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Get ready for it
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)
You said there's only one place left to find
Together we can save the world tonight
Get ready for it
You said every life is a lesson
Are you a fool or a Kingsman?
'Cause only you know
Hold on 'cause the volume is rising
Yeah the volume is rising so you better hold on
The night is young
Until it's over
Until it's over
The night is young
The night is ours
Until tomorrow
Until tomorrow
Get ready for it
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Yeah get ready for it
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)
You said there's only one place left to find
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Together we can save the world tonight
Get ready for it
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Get ready for it
Get ready for it
Get ready for it
Get ready for it
The night is young
Until it's over
Until it's over
The night is young
The night is ours
Until tomorrow
Until tomorrow
Get ready for it
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)
I'll hold your hand
With good intentions
With good intentions
I'll hold your hand
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)
The night is ours
Until tomorrow
Until tomorrow
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)
You said there's only one place left to find
Together we can save the world tonight
Get ready for it
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Get ready for it
Get ready for it
Get ready for it 
Get ready for it
