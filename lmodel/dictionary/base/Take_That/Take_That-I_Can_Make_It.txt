<song artist="Take_That" title="I_Can_Make_It">
I'm tired of closing my eyes, to picture you in my mind 
It feels so cold to be alone 
Not sure where I want to be, so close to finding my dream 
We need to hold on to all the times we spoke of love 
Now I pray to God above that someday I can find the door 
I'm looking for 
I can make it, I know I can 
I can save this love forever 
I can make it, I know I can 
We can make this work together 
It's not a lonely men's dream, it's just that now that there's been 
A taste of love in my life 
That I refuse to return, I've got so much to learn 
How can it feels as though I've reached the top of this steep hill 
For a moment I was standing still 
Now I have the faith I've needed to believe 
'Cause you know what this love means to me 
You know how it feels when I can see it in your face 
That you're missing me now, you feel I've let you down 
You've gotta hold on, you've gota reach out and believe 
I can make this world a place for me and you 
We can make it, we can make it together
