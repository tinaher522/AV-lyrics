Gary:
For once in my life I couldn't deny
I thought that I'd found my everything,
A lover, a friend, the hours we'd spend just doing nothing at all,
Yeah, but your need to leave is yours alone, break free let go,
Butterfly fly, fly away from here
I know we tried, tried through the laughter and the tears
You'll always be a part of me
In my heart you'll always be
Butterfly fly, fly away, fly away
Deep in your eyes the stare that I find
All that I really ever need.
Whatever I do you know that it's you girl, in every face I see yeah
Your last goodbye was yours alone, break free let go,
Butterfly fly, fly away from here
I know we tried, tried through the laughter and the tears
You'll always be a part of me
In my heart you'll always be
Butterfly fly, fly away,
To the place you belong, I hope you hear the feeling strong
Hope that you could find the freedom in your life, in your life
Ahh sweet butterfly, just fly away, just fly away
I know we tried, tried through the laughter and the tears
You'll always be a part of me
In my heart you'll always be
Butterfly fly, fly away, fly away
Oh Fly Away, Oh Yeah
For once in my life I couldn't deny,
I thought that I'd found my everything,
A lover a friend, the hours we would spend just doing nothing at all
For once in my life I couldn't deny,
I thought that I'd found my everything,
For once in my life I couldn't deny,
I thought that I'd found my everything,
