<song artist="Take_That" title="I_Wish_There_Was_A_Way">
I wish there was a way
To put into words
All the thing you are to me
Oh,how would I even begin to say
Would you really mean?
Would you say "I love you"
Like I always do?
That seems so little
For all the things you
You have stolen my heart and soul
You didn't do it on purpose
You were just being yourself
That's why I love you and no one else
I look in to your eyes all the time
Knowing in my heart
I have you as mine
I don't want you to be my possession
You have taught me a lesson
Of what love is, a love
I believe was sent from god above

If you were to take my hand and lead me away
Do you know that I wouldn't stay
Just look inot my eyes and you will know
My love for you will grow
Seems like yesterday I was lost
How I give you my love
No matter the cost
You are my love of all loves
All I hope from you
Just to love me as I love you
When I hold you so very tight
I know I will try with all my might
To keep this love alive
I hope someday you will let me
Hold and keep and make you my wife
"I love you"
