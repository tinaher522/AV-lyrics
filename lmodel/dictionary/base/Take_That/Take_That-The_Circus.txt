<song artist="Take_That" title="The_Circus">
Silence please 'cos i've got something to say 
And i'm going round in circles every day 
The more i shout the more i hesitate 
Now that you're gone 
Now that you're gone 
Stand up please til i'm done losing my mind 
And i've thanked you all just one too many times 
The more we fall the harder we must climb 
Now that you're gone 
Now that you're gone 
Cos' everybody loves a circus show 
But i'm the only clown you'll ever know 
And now you can applaud my best mistake 
I love you was too many words to say, to say 
Silence please 'cos i've got something to say 
And before the music takes you all away 
I never thought I'd leave it all so late 
Now that you're gone, Oh you're gone 
Yeah, everybody loves a circus show 
But i'm the only clown you'll ever know 
And now you can applaud my best mistake 
I love you was too many words to say 
I love you was too many words to say, to say 
I never thought I'd leave it all so late 
Now that you're gone, Oh you're gone 
Yeah, everybody loves a circus show 
But i'm the only clown you'll ever know 
And now you can applaud my best mistake 
I love you was too many words to say 
I love you was too many words to say, to say
