<song artist="Take_That" title="Sunday_To_Saturday">
Monday morning and the feeling's still the same
It's our Sunday through to Saturday love
This aint no weekend thing this aint no teenage game
It's our Sunday through to Saturday love
It's our Sunday through to Saturday love
It's our Sunday through to Saturday love (bah bah bah)
This aint no one night stand no part time lovin man
It's our Sunday through to Saturday love
I have no reason to be feeling kinda strange
But I guess that's just the man that I am
In the clouds in my dreams in pouring rain
Hand in hand under this rainbow we can always stay the same
It's our Sunday through to Saturday love
It's our Sunday through to Saturday love (bah bah bah)
This aint no one night stand no part time lovin man
It's our Sunday through to Saturday love
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Saturday
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday
Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Anyday
Sunday, Monday, Friday, Anyday
It's our Sunday through to Saturday love
It's our Sunday through to Saturday love (bah bah bah)
This aint no one night stand no part time lovin man
It's our Sunday through to Saturday love
