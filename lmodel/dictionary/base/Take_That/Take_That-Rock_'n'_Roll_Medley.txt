(Ladies and Gentlemen
Please welcome a legend in his own mind
Gary Lee Lewis!)
You shake my nerves and you rattle my brain
Too much love drives a man insane
You broke my will, oh what a thrill
Goodness gracious, great balls of fire!
I laughed at love 'cause I thought it was funny
You came along and you moved me, honey
I changed my mind, this love is fine
Goodness gracious, great balls of fire!
Kiss me, baby, mmh feels good
Hold me, baby
Well, I want to love you like a lover should
You're fine, so kind
I can tell this world rhat you're mine mine mine mine.
I chew my nails and I twiddle my thumbs
I'm real nervous 'cause it sure is fun
C'mon baby, you drive me crazy
Goodness gracious, great balls of fire!
Goodness gracious, great balls of ...

Let's go for a little walk
Under the moon of love
Let's sit right down and talk
Under the moon of love
I wanna tell ya that I love ya
And I want you to be my girl
Darlin', let's walk, let's talk
Under the moon of love.
You look so lovely (tonight)
Under the moon of love
Your little eyes shining brightly (tonight)
Under the moon of love
Hold me close, hold me tight
Be my love tonight
Little darlin', let's walk, let's talk
Under the moon of love.
I'm gonna talk sweet talk
And whisper things in your ears, oh baby
I'm gonna tell you little things
I know you've been longin' to hear
(Come on little darling, take my hands)
(Let him off)
Let's go for a little walk
Under the moon of love
Let's sit right down and talk
Under the moon of love
I wanna tell ya that I love ya
And I want you to be my girl
Little darlin', let's walk, let's talk
Under the moon of love
Little darlin', let's walk, let's talk
Under the moon of love
Little darlin', let's walk, let's talk
Under the moon of love.

Baby, let me be your little Teddy Bear
Put a chain around my neck
And lead me anywhere
Oh let me be a Teddy Bear.
I don't wanna be a tiger
Tigers play too rough
I don't wanna be a lion
'Cause lions ain't the kind that you love enough.
Just wanna be your Teddy Bear
So put a chain around my neck
And lead me anywhere
Oh let me be a Teddy Bear
Just wanna be (your Teddy Bear)
Just wanna be your Teddy Bear.

How low can you go?
How low can you go?
How low can you go?
How low can you go?
Ohhohhohhohh
Born to hand jive, baby
Born to hand jive, baby
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Born to hand jive, oh yeah
