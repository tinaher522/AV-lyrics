<song artist="Take_That" title="Everything_Changes">
Girl. come over here
Let me hold you for a little
And remember
I'll always love you
Forever more
Everything changes but you 
We've said goodbye, the taxi cab is waiting 
Now don't you cry, just one more kiss 
Before I have to go 
Hey girl I know the situation's changed  (situation changed)
And so much is new but something in my life 
Remains the same cause 
Everything changes but you 
We're a thousand miles apart 
But you know I love you 
Everything changes but you 
You know every single day 
I'll be thinking about you 
The rumour's true, you know that there've been others 
What can I do, I tell you baby they don't mean a thing 
Now girl don't go and throw our love away 
I'll be home soon back in your arms to hear you say that 
Eveything changes but you 
We're a thousand miles apart 
But you know I love you 
Everything changes but you 
You know every single day 
I'll be thinking about you girl
Everything changes but you 
We're a thousand miles apart 
But I still love you, I do 
Everything changes but you 
I'll spend every single day 
Thinking about you 
Though everything changes around us 
(Baby don't you cry) 
We will be the same as before forever more 
Everything changes but you 
We're a thousand miles apart 
And I miss you baby 
Everything changes but you 
You know every single day 
I'll be thinking about you girl
Everything changes but you 
I'll be thinking about you
Thinking about you 
Everything changes but you 
Cause you know I love you 
Know that I love you 
Everything changes but you 
I'll be thinkin' about you
Thinking about you 
Everything changes but you 
I love you, I love you
