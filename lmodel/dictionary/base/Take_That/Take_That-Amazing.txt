<song artist="Take_That" title="Amazing">
Nobody knows if I told you you’d laugh out loud
If you heard her voice calling your name you’d never be the same
Nothing was new and nowhere was safe and sound
And then she arrived, oh just in time to save this heart of mine
Oh, I’d waited all my life
All I know is
Nobody knows it feels so amazing
And nobody else got my story to tell
My head’s in the clouds I’m no longer chasing
And nobody knows that it feels so amazing
Maybe she knows, and maybe she’ll soon be mine
In a perfect world, you know that this girl would be right here tonight
Weighing heavy on my mind
All I know is
Nobody knows it feels so amazing
And nobody else got my story to tell
My head’s in the clouds I’m no longer chasing
And nobody knows that it feels so amazing
And nobody knows that it feels so amazing
Maybe my heart and my head are colliding
Or maybe it’s more than I dare to believe
Don’t ever let me forget what I’m feeling
Or wake up to find that it’s all just a dream
All I know is
Nobody knows it feels so amazing
And nobody else got my story to tell
My head’s in the clouds that I’m no longer chasing
And nobody knows that it feels so amazing
And nobody knows that it feels so amazing
