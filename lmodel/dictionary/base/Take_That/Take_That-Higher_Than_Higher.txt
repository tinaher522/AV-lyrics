<song artist="Take_That" title="Higher_Than_Higher">
I used to be broken
Stuck in a cage
I used to be low down
I couldn’t be saved
Now I feel like a lion
That cannot be tamed
'Cause you brought me back to life, to life again
I was fearless but so easily
I let life fade away the color of my dreams
Now you’re with me, I know I can be
Higher, higher than higher
(You’re lifting me up)
If you weren’t, you weren’t here
I’d be on the ground
If you weren’t, you weren’t here
I’d be out of my mind
'Cause you are, you are here
I can be higher, higher than higher
(You’re lifting me up)
If you weren’t, you weren’t here
I’d be lost in the fire
If you weren’t, you weren’t here
Couldn’t open up my eyes
'Cause you are, you are here
I can be higher, higher than higher
(You’re lifting me up)
The sky is a long way
When covered in rain
You gave me my vision
You gave me my faith
And now I’m a fighter
I found the flame
You set me alight, alight again
I was fearless but so easily
I let life fade away the colour of my dreams
Now you’re with me, I know I can be
Higher, higher than higher
(You’re lifting me up)
If you weren’t, you weren’t here
I’d be on the ground
If you weren’t, you weren’t here
I’d be out of my mind
'Cause you are, you are here
I can be higher, higher than higher
(You’re lifting me up)
If you weren’t, you weren’t here
I’d be lost in the fire
If you weren’t, you weren’t here
Couldn’t open up my eyes
Cos you are, you are here
I can be higher, higher than higher
(You’re lifting me up)
Just one way for us now
There’s no coming down
You’ve brought me back to life
So I’m gonna go up
Higher, higher than higher
Higher than higher, higher than higher
(You’re lifting me up)
'Cause you are, you are here
I got my feet off the ground
'Cause you are, you are here
Still losing my mind
'Cause you are, you are here
I can be higher, higher than higher
'Cause you are, you are here
Now I’ve found the fire
'Cause you are, you are here
I can open up my eyes
'Cause you are, you are here
I can be higher
Higher than higher
Higher than higher
Higher, higher than higher
Higher, higher than higher
Higher, higher than higher
Higher, higher than higher
You’re lifting me up
Higher, higher than higher
Higher, higher than higher
