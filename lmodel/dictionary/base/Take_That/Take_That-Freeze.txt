<song artist="Take_That" title="Freeze">
With a little bit of work
And a little bit of conversation
With a head full of hope
And a bit of your self belief
Is it asking too much to
Rely on your imagination
Am I asking too much
To remain in your company
Stop everything
We can stay here if you hold still
We can stay here for life if you say you will
We’ll be caught in a moment of time
If we all freeze…
Don’t even breathe
Everyone freeze
Then you won’t leave
Freeze
With the flicker of a promise
And in view of our situation
I think you should know
That I never wanted this to change
And you’re free to say whatever you want to
But whatever you want, whatever you want
Don’t change
Please don’t change
We can stay here if you hold still
We can stay here for life if you say you will
We’ll be caught in a moment of time
If we all freeze…
Don’t even breathe
Everyone freeze
Then you won’t leave
The words, the words we never say
Don’t make a sound till it’s too late
Just freeze so we don’t have to start again
Before we make the same mistakes
Before we throw it all away
The words, the words we never say
Don’t make a sound till it’s too late
Just freeze so we don’t have to start again
Before we make the same mistakes
Before we throw it all away
Just freeze
Don’t even breathe
Everyone freeze
Then you won’t leave
Everyone freeze
