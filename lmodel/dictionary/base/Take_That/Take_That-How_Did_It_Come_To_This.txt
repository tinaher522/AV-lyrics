<song artist="Take_That" title="How_Did_It_Come_To_This">
Just the other day, somebody said to me 
'Hey, maybe you're just slightly schizophrenic and a little out of reach my friend' 
I said 
'Yes, that's partly true' 
But jokes aside, I can explain, it's just my way of keeping track 
With living on this planet 
Now then, have you turned on your TV 
Have you seen reality 
Have you seen the programme that, you've spent your whole life looking for 
There's a girl in Camden town 
Indecision makes her frown 
Which dress would she wear today and which way should she smile at me 
How did it come to this 
How did it ever come to this 
All the noises, all these lights 
All these talkings through the night 
All these expectation now it's making me neurotic 
Tell me have you seen your face before 
I forgot to say 'Hello' 
Thought I'd make it clear now 
That I've always been a smiler, tell me 
How did it come to this 
How did it ever come to this 
How did it come to this 
How did it ever come to this 
Sometimes it's like I'm a world away 
Sometimes I feel a world away 
Just the other day somebody said to me 
'Hey maybe you are oh so slightly OCD, a little out of reach my friend' 
I said 
'Yes, that's partly true' 
But jokes aside 
Please stay with me 
It's just my way of compartmentalising 
All the things I see 
How did it come to this 
How did it ever come to this 
How did it come to this 
How did it ever come to this
