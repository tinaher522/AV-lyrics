<song artist="Take_That" title="Pretty_Things">
Dumb down let your crazy out 
Boys go crazy over you
Grip like a new york window cleaner 
Just staring at you
Youth don't leave me, hair stay on me
God I love those hips
Oh memory don't forsake me
Not like this
All those pretty things, don't sweat the pretty things
So collectable, why not collect them all
Obviously cunningly, womanly
All those pretty things, god bless the pretty things
They're still out there somewhere 
Making men feel this way
At fallen broadway station
I see them every day, all day
Download a little meditation
It might pull you through
She blinded me with silence
Anchored here with you
All those pretty things, don't sweat the pretty things
So collectable, why not collect them all
Obviously cunningly, womanly
All those pretty things, god bless the pretty things
All those pretty things, don't sweat the pretty things
So collectable, why not collect them all
Obviously cunningly, womanly
All those pretty things, god bless the pretty things
Does she talk like ooh ooh ooh
Will it feel like ah ah ah
Does she tell you what she wants
Can you give her what she needs
Youth don't leave me, hair stay on me, god I love those hips
Oh memory don't forsake me, not like this
All those pretty things, don't sweat the pretty things
So collectable, why not collect them all
Obviously cunningly, womanly
All those pretty things, god bless the pretty things
All those pretty things, don't sweat the pretty things
So collectable, why not collect them all
Obviously cunningly, womanly
All those pretty things, god bless the pretty things
