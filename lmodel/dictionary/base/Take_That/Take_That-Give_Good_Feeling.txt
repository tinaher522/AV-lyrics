<song artist="Take_That" title="Give_Good_Feeling">
You've got to hold me, and control my dreams 
I want you to fulfil my needs, I feel it babe 
Something good is gonna happen 
I can't believe in this world I see 
I reach out to you, set me free from these chains 
I'm holding on, trying hard 
Just so you know I'm here waiting for you to 
CHORUS: 
Give good feeling to me 
Baby I know this feeling won't go 
Makes you want to be free 
In a world where we fly, fly, fly 
Don't let me go, I will be your prisoner 
Hold me down and I will give you my reasons for 
Loving you, needing you, can't do without ya 
If you think I'm crazy for loving you baby 
Then I will show you the way that I feel 
I'm holding on, trying hard 
Just so you know I'm here waiting, so please ...
CHORUS (x2)
Come on let's fly, come on let's fly 
Come on let's fly, come on let's fly, yeah
If you think I'm crazy for loving you baby 
Then I will show you the way that I feel 
Give good feeling to me!
CHORUS (x2)
