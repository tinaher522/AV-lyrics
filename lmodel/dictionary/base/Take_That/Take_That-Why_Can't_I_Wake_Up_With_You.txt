<song artist="Take_That" title="Why_Can't_I_Wake_Up_With_You">
Oh, I can't decide
If I should read or think
I'll keep an open mind
Till the day sets in
I hear you call me ( hear you call me, you call me)
I'm so willing to call back ( willing to call back)
Hear you thinking
Hope you hear me thinking too
Why can't I wake up with you
So you're there when I open my eyes (there when I open my eyes)
Baby why can't I wake up with you
You're my life
Oh, I feel alive
So I'll just begin
To read my mind
Before you ring me
Hear you thinking
Hope you hear me thinking too
Why can't I wake up with you
So you're there when I open my eyes (there when I open my eyes)
Baby why can't I wake up with you
You're my life
So good to be near you (so good to be near you)
So dark when you walk from my side
Baby why can't I wake up with you
You're my life (you're my life)
Hear you thinking
Hope you hear me thinking too
Why can't I wake up with you
So you're there when I open my eyes (there when I open my eyes)
Baby why can't I wake up with you
You're my life
Why don't we dream the same night
So you're there when the dark turns to light
Baby I know this is right
You're my life
