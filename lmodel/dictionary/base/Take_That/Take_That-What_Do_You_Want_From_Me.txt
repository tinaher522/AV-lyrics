<song artist="Take_That" title="What_Do_You_Want_From_Me">
My greatest fear is
we're just wasting tears
wasting several years
still being round here
My greatest fear is
Maybe you will notice
I'm not what you wanted
after all these years
But I, I've got a very big hope for us
I'm gonna keep looking out for us
It's been a difficult year
And I still wanna make love with you
So where do we go from here
What do you want from me?
What do you want from me?
I still think I'm in love with you
I still wanna belong to you
So what do you want from me?
What do you want from me now?
Your greatest fear is we're not getting wiser
We're not wise at all
It's getting harder, harder to recover
From the night before
When you turn me on
But I, I like to think of us moving on
I like to think of us getting on
So answer me, where do we go from here?
Where do we go,
Because I, I still wanna get old with you
I still want us to grow
What do you want from me?
What do you want from me?
I, I still think I'm in love with you
I still feel you're the one
So, what do you want from me?
What do you want from me now?
Has it crossed your mind we might already know?
If we only let it go...
Yeah
I, I still wanna have sex with you
I still wanna go out with you
So what do you want from me?
What do you want from me?
I, I think somedays we're beautiful
I think someday's we're not
So what do you want from me?
What do you want from me now?
Let's make it positive
What do you want from me?
What do you want from me now?
We're making me progress here
So where shall we go?
What do you want from me?
What do you want from me now?
