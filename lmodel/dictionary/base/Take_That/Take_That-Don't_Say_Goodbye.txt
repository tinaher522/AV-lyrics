<song artist="Take_That" title="Don't_Say_Goodbye">
Don't stay where you're not loved
Those people obscure the view
But if I've done my job
They won't want to mess with you
Finance and romances
A place where you'll exist
Live with your mother's smile
But see you through daddy's eyes
You might lose your dignity
But it's not what it used to be
And don't say Goodbye to the world
Until you've loved somebody
Don't say Goodbye to the world
Until you've lived like Kings and Queens
I'll be the first and last thing that you see
But don't say goodbye to me
Just listen to your heart
Not the voices in your head
Forget how it made you feel
But don't forget what was said
Tears are words that we can touch
When words only say so much
Want what you've got
Then you'll always have enough
You might lose your dignity
But look what it's done for me
And don't say Goodbye to the world
Until you've loved somebody
Don't say Goodbye to the world
Until you've lived like Kings and Queens
I'll be the first and last thing that you see
But don't say goodbye to me
And don't say Goodbye to the world
Until you've loved somebody
Don't say Goodbye to the world
Until you've lived like Kings and Queens
I'll be the fist and last thing that you see
But don't say goodbye to me
