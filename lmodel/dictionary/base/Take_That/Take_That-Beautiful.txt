<song artist="Take_That" title="Beautiful">
Let all that's simple pass you by
Let all that lives be free to die
We're all, we're all key to life
Face all that rage and history
It makes no sense to you and me
We're all, we're all free to fight
I broke all my vows, my common sense
Says find vocation somewhere else
This should've been so beautiful
Should've been my proudest moment
How to have and lose you all
How to be a disappointment
Save your cheers and my applause
I never was worth fighting for
This should've been so beautiful
Been so beautiful
It could've been so beautiful
Tonight
Lay all that's sinful down to rest
May all our judgements be confessed
We're all, we're all guilty now
Drink for the crowd not for yourself
Til someone hears your cry for help
Let's all, let's all take a bow
I spent all my mind on making sense
It made no difference in the end
This should've been so beautiful
Should've been my proudest moment
How to have and lose you all
How to be a disappointment
Save your cheers and my applause
I never was worth fighting for
This should've been so beautiful
Been so beautiful
It could've been so beautiful
Tonight
I close my eyes and I am somebody else
Tonight
I close my eyes and I don't need any help
Every moment of laughter
Every moment I fear
Every moment that you're not here
This should've been so beautiful, so beautiful, be so beautiful
This should have been so beautiful, been so beautiful
This should've been so beautiful
Should've been my proudest moment
How to have and lose you all
How to be a disappointment
Save your cheers and my applause
I never was worth fighting for
This should've been so beautiful
Been so beautiful
I could've been so beautiful
Tonight
