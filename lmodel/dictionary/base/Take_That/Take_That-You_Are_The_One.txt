<song artist="Take_That" title="You_Are_The_One">
You hurt my mind
You hurt my soul
Never believing what I'm saying
I'll hunt you down
I'll make you mine
You'll be the game I've started playing
And if you won't be there
I will know where you're going (where you're going)
And if you won't be there 
I'll try every way of showing you that
You are the one
You are the one
The one for me ( you are the one, you are the one )
You are the one
You are the one
The one I need ( you are the one, you are the one )
You understand
You realise
The scene that I'm creating
And all the while
You compromise 
On the liberties I'm taking
If you don't believe I want just you and I together ( together )
Than you won't believe the dream of you and I forever, because
You are the one
You are the one
The one for me (you are the one, you are the one)
You are the one
You are the one
The one I need ( you are the one, you are the one)
