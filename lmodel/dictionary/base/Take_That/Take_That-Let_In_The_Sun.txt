<song artist="Take_That" title="Let_In_The_Sun">
You've found yourself alone in a room
Total devastation
In the darkness you must enter the code
And crack the combination all on your own
Ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo
Ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo
Pick yourself up and search for the light
Hungry for a new start
It's your chance now to stand up and fight
Take the next step now a day at a time
Open up, open up
Everybody's waiting
From high above, feel the love
Open up your windows
Let in the sun
Let in the sun
Let in the sun
Just let in the sun
Good to see you with your feet on the track
Waiting for a restart
Leaving all that once what was holding you back
Want you to see the sun rise as fast as you can
Ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo
Ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo
Pick it up, turn it round
Ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo
Ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo
Want you to see the sun rise as fast as you can
Open up, open up
Everybody's waiting
From high above, feel the love
Open up your windows
Let in the sun
Let in the sun
Let in the sun
Just let in the sun
Feel the air and breathe it in
Feel the warmth upon your skin
Looking out and looking in, oh-oh
Every colour in your eyes
In reflection of the light
Every minute, every night
Open up, open up
Everybody's waiting
From high above, feel the love
Open up your windows
Let in the sun
Let in the sun
Let in the sun
Let in the sun
Just let in the sun
Oh let in the sun
Let in the sun
Let in the sun
