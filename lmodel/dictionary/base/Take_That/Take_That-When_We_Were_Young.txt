<song artist="Take_That" title="When_We_Were_Young">
When we were young the world seemed so old
Careless and cold, we did what we were told in our lives
When we were young
Had the world by the tail
Good would prevail
Starships set sail
And none of us would fail in this life
Not when you're young
We were drawn to whoever
Could keep us together
And bound by the heavens above
And we tried to survive
Travelling at the speed of love
Whoa
When we were young
When we adored the fabulous
Whoa
When we were young
We were the foolish fearless
Never knowing the cost of what we paid
Letting someone else be strong
Whoa
When we were young
In a moment of grace
A long leap of faith
There's still more glory stored away
It's my life
I'm here with the lovers
And we burn the bridges we're crossing over
Just to see the firelight
And the innocent are getting over
Being old tonight
Whoa
When we were young
When everything was what it seemed
Whoa
When we were young
And every day was how we dreamed
Never knowing the cost of what we paid
Letting someone else be strong
Whoa
When we were young
And when you'll look at yourself tonight
Are you someone you recognize
You can take back what you've given away
But it must be the last time
Whoa
When we were young
Whoa
When we were young
When we were young
Whoa
When we were young
When we adored the fabulous
Whoa
When we were young
We were the foolish fearless
Whoa
When we were young
We didn'tknow it wouldn't last
Whoa
When we were young
