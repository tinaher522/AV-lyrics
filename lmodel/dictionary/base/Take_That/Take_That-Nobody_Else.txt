<song artist="Take_That" title="Nobody_Else">
Making my way, 
through old photographs,
from the night when you first stood by my side,
old friends with smiles, 
some are here some are gone,
good memories of our senior high,
Looking back, 
we're the only couple still together,
even then, 
I knew this love would be forever, 
I knew,
'cos there's nobody else, 
in this world, 
that could love you,
anymore than I do, 
always here for you,
nobody else, 
in this world, 
could love you more,
nobody could love you, 
anymore than I do,
I'm still here for you,
oh I'm still here for you,
Our lives have all changed, 
we've come a long long way,
our faces show the lines of  two young sons,
and in their houses there will be, 
pictures like the ones of you and me,
(hope they can look back and smile) 
just like we have done,
Never once, 
have I ever felt the need for another,
(Never felt the need, never felt the need for another)
we were strong, 
and survived this storm in time to discover,
to discover one another,
yeah eh yeah,
'cos there's nobody else,
in this world,
that could love you,
anymore than I do,
always here for you,
nobody else,
in this world,
could love you more,
nobody could love you,
any more than I do,
I'm still here for you,
And all of the smiles we have won,
just from looking back, 
and reliving all those good times,
when we've been through all the pages,
we'll just start again, 
we'll just start again, 
yeah eh..
'cos there's nobody else,
in this world,
that could love you,
anymore than I do,
always here for you,
nobody else,
in this world,
could love you more,
(no, no oh oh)
nobody could love you,
(nobody baby nobody),
anymore than I do,
'cos girl I'm here for you,
'cos there's nobody else,
in this world,
that could love you,
anymore than I do,
always here for you,
nobody else,
in this world,
could love you more,
nobody could love you,
anymore than I do,
I'm still here for you oh,
always here for you,
(nobody else)
oh yeah
(nobody else)
nobody, nobody but you,
(nobody else)
nobody, nobody but you,
(nobody else)
nobody, nobody baby no,
(nobody else)
nobody
(oh oh oh, nobody else)
nobody, nobody,
(nobody else)
no no nobody else, nobody but you
(nobody else)
nobody but you....
