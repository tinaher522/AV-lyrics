<song artist="Take_That" title="If_This_Is_Love">
You came to me, baby 
And I though that I saw love in your eyes 
But all the promises you made were not to be 
I should have seen through your disguise 
Ohh no baby you know you always tried 
Make me look the fool, what's goin' on 
You used to be so good to me now what is wrong 
Tell me why you wanna hurt me 
Is this the way that love has got to be 
Now baby I can't take it 
If this is love then love's not meant for me 
What has happened to you lately 
I don't sense that lovin', feelin' anymore 
Everytime you bring me down I wanna cry 
Do you wanna see me walkin' out that door 
Tell me why you wanna hurt me 
Is this the way that love has got to be 
Now baby I can't take it 
If this is love then love's not meant for me 
Ohhh no baby you know you're always trying 
To make me look the fool 
Won't you tell me why you hurt me 
Is this the love has got to be 
No baby, I can't take it 
If this is love then love's not meant for me 
Tell me why you wanna hurt me 
Is this the way that love has got to be 
Now baby I can't take it 
If this is love then love's not meant for me
