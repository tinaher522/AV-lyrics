<song artist="Take_That" title="Sleepwalking">
Hmm, yeah, yeah, hmm
Falling into sleep, I'm on my way
Stepping through the bedroom door and down the stairs
It's all about a dream I have to make
Only when I find your road will I be there, yeah
I'm sleepwalking, don't wanna lay back down
I'm sleepwalking, noone to wake me now
There's no need to run, there's no need to fly
Cause I'm sleepwalking
Sweet dreams tonight
So much better when I close my eyes
Drifting in a peaceful mind, it all begins
Is it even real, I can't decide
Standing at your doorway, wont you let me in?
Cause I'm sleepwalking (sleepwalking), don't wanna lay back down
I'm sleepwalking (sleepwalking), noone to wake me now
There's no need to run, there's no need to fly
Cause I'm sleepwalking
Sleepwalking back to your side
Don't let me out of your sight
Don't let me down
I'm only dreaming, I'm only by your side
Ooooh, yeah
Cause I'm sleepwalking (sleepwalking), don't wanna lay back down
I'm sleepwalking (sleepwalking), noone to wake me now
There's no need to run, there's no need to fly
Cause I'm sleepwalking
Sweet dreams tonight
Sweet dreams tonight
