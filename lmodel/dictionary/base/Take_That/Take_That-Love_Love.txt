<song artist="Take_That" title="Love_Love">
You bring me right back down to the earth from the Promised Land
We're getting close to the centre of the earth with an honest plan
You'll never be your mother or your father, do you understand?
Until you understand
We don't have too much time here
And time it travels far too fast
We're not too far, we're too near
Before they take it from our hands
Why don't you teach your heart to feel?
And give your love love
Give your love love
Give it all away
Why don't you teach your heart to talk?
And give your love love
Give your love love
Give me, give me what I need
We'll take you right back down to the earth from the Mother Land
This is a first-class journey to the gods from the Son of Man
You're at the gates of human revolution, don't you understand?
Why don't you understand?
We don't have too much time here
And time it travels far too fast
We're not too far, we're too near
Before they take it from our hands
Why don't you teach your heart to feel?
And give your love love
Give your love love
Give it all away
Why don't you teach your heart to talk?
And give your love love
Give your love love
Give it all away
Why don't you teach your heart to feel?
And give your love love
Give your love love
Give it all away
Why don't you teach your heart to talk?
And give your love love
Give your love love
Give me, give me what I need
We don't have too much time here
And time it travels far too fast
We're not too far, we're too near
Before they take it from our hands
Why don't you teach your heart to feel?
And give your love love
Give your love love
Give it all away
Why don't you teach your heart to talk?
And give your love love
Give your love love
Give it all away
Why don't you teach your heart to feel?
And give your love love
Give your love love
Give it all away
Why don't you teach your heart to talk?
And give your love love
Give your love love
Give me, give me what I need
