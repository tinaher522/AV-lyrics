<song artist="Take_That" title="Ain't_No_Sense_In_Love">
I'm afraid of the morning
I'm afraid of the light
You should come with a warning
You should be wearing a sign
That says you're beautiful trouble
So you better beware
One look and I was in right over my head.
Oh this misery
There's no place on earth I'd rather be.
You're not the one I need
You're just the one that I want
Makes a perfect sense to me
You're not the one I need
But you're the one that I want
There Ain't no sense of love.
Ain't no sense of love.
I try to stop myself
So many times
But I keep falling over
Yeah, I keep crossing the line
The heart of a gypsy and the soul of a stone
It's just a matter of time before you leave ma alone.
Oh sweet misery
Fill my heart up and pour it all over me.
Cause You're not the one I need

You're just the one that I want
Makes a perfect sense to me
You're not the one I need
But you're the one that I want
There Ain't no sense of love.
Ain't no sense of love.
It's not logical
That's the way I feel
It's not logical
Psychological
It's heaven underneath my skin but it's hell out here.
You're not the one I need
You're just the one that I want
Makes a perfect sense to me
Cause You're not the one I need
But you're the one that I want
There Ain't no sense of love.
Ain't no sense of love.
Your Just The One That I Want
Makes Perfect Sense To Me
Aint No Sense in Love
Oooh Yeah
No Sense In Love
