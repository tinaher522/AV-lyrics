<song artist="Take_That" title="Could_It_Be_Magic">
Spirits move me, everytime I'm near you
Whirling like a cyclone in my mind
Your my life line, angel of my lifetime
Answer to all answers I can find
Baby I want you come, come, come into my arms
Let me feel the wonder of all of you
Could it be magic now, now, now and hold on fast
Could this be the magic at last
Baby take me high upon a hillside
High up where the stallion meets the sun
I could love you, yeh build my world around you
Never leave you till my life is done
Baby I want you come, come, come into my arms
Let me feel the wonder of all of you
Could it be magic now, now, now and hold on fast
Could this be the magic at last
Could it be magic now, now, now and hold on fast
Could this be the magic at last
Baby I want you come, come, come into my arms
Let me feel the wonder of all of you
Could it be magic now ...
