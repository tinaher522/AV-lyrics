UNDERGROUND MACHINE
I, I’m just a piece of your pie chart
You’re in a room with a rock star
Only I play the good parts of a kind heart
The sky’s too low and the room’s too dark
But she just carries on
And I get her in but her friend gets turned away
But what can I say?
When the boy meets girl and the girl meets boy
And the boy thinks the girl’s all right
Get your head out the library
Get the courage of the cavalry
You might be good looking,
But you can’t sleep with yourself tonight
Oh what a beast, oh what a man
You’ve gotta get it while you can
Oh what a beast, oh what a man
Oh I, I wish that beggars were choosers
Unload my love like a looter
I need some gas and a kick start, for a good heart
The lightings cheap, and the room is cold
But she just carries on
And you’ll get no sleep
But you might be turned away
So what will you say?
When the boy meets girl and the girl meets boy
And the boy thinks the girl’s all right
Get your head out the library
Get the courage of the cavalry
You might be good looking,
But you can’t sleep with yourself tonight
Oh what a beast, oh what a man
You’ve gotta get it while you can
Oh what a beast, oh what a man
Oh what a beast, oh what a man
When the boy meets girl and the girl meets boy
And the boy thinks the girl’s all right
Get your head out the library
Get the courage of the cavalry
If you’re so good looking
Why don’t you sleep with yourself tonight?
Oh what a beast, oh what a man
You’ve gotta get it while you can
You’ve gotta get it while you can
You’ve gotta get it while you can
Oh what a beast, oh what a man
