<song artist="Take_That" title="Flaws">
You should know what you’re fighting for
Can’t promise you oh that perfect life
To get this far I’ve seen darker times
Never looking up, running from the light
Always out of reach, ignoring every sign
I have so many, so many flaws
If you take me, if you take me, they’re yours
And if you see tomorrow I’ll give you it all
Take me, take me, I’m yours
You should know cos I care about you
And you deserve more than any truth
The dirt and soil it’s still beneath my nails
Don’t know how to win only how to fail
I have so many, so many flaws
If you take me, if you take me, they’re yours
And if you see tomorrow I’ll give you it all
Take me, take me, I’m yours
Oh, I wanna be a better man than I am
Oh, I wanna be the one who says he understands
And you'll see tomorrow I’ll give you it all
Take me, take me, I’m yours
I have so many, so many flaws
If you take me, if you take me, they’re yours
Oh, if you see tomorrow I’ll give you it all
Take me, take me, I’m yours
Just take me, take me, I’m yours
Just take me, take me, I’m yours
