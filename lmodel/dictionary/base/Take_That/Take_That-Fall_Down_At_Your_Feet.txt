<song artist="Take_That" title="Fall_Down_At_Your_Feet">
I’ve given all that I can give
It’s only all I wanted
Holding you it’s easier to breathe
The more I lose, the less it hurts
The hurt is saving me
I’m on my knees
Oh please
I… I wanna fall down at your feet
Why… why do you bring me to my knees
I… I wanna fall down at your feet
Down on my knees
On my knees
Take it all, I take the fall
Don’t have to give it back
I give you the world, so tell me when to stop
Anything you want, anytime you want
Tell me what you need
I give you the world, so tell me when to stop
I… I wanna fall down at your feet
Why… why do you bring me to my knees
I… I wanna fall down at your feet
Down on my knees
On my knees
Anything you want, anytime you want
Tell me what you need
I… I wanna fall down at your feet
Down on my knees
On my knees
Down on my knees
On my knees
Down on my knees
On my knees
