<song artist="Take_That" title="What_You_Beleive_In">
What am I to you and what are you to me?
Are we getting better or did we used to be?
What of the song we used to sing?
Where are the souls we used to carry in?
What is a sail without hurricane?
What is a hurt without someone to blame?
Show me the sky and I'll, I'll climb the stairs
Give me something 'cause I'm losing it
Give me what it is you believe in
'Cause I give to you my truth
I got all my faith in you
I don't know which way we are going
Doesn't matter anyway
Just as long as you will stay
Tell me the word and I'll shout it out
For what is a voice when in doubt?
The world has changed, the world will change
Oh, give me something 'cause I, I need to feel
Give me what it is you believe in
'Cause I give to you my truth
I got all my faith in you
I don't know which way we are going
Doesn't matter anyway
Just as long as you will stay
It's so good you know
I still love you so
And you don't have to do this on your own
No, no
Give me what it is you believe in
'Cause I give to you my truth
I got all my faith in you
I don't know which way we are going
Doesn't matter anyway
Just as long as you will stay
Give me what it is you believe in
'Cause I give to you my truth
I got all my faith in you
I don't know which way we are going
(It's so good you know, it's so good you know)
Doesn't matter anyway
(I still love you so)
Just as long as you will stay
(I still love you so)
