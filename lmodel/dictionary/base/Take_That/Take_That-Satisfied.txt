<song artist="Take_That" title="Satisfied">
Baby I'm watching you to see
I don't like the way you've been treating me
I promised you nothing and gave you much more
Making love is all you wanted me for
You're never satisfied, You're never satisfied
If you open up your mind you'll see
That you could be satisfied with me
Baby you criticize my every move
Look, can't you see I've got nothing to prove
I've had enough, it's a matter of time
Mabye we'll make it somewhere down the line
You can be if you wanna be
Repeat
Repeat
I often wonder what I see in you
You don't do the things that I want you to do
I open my eyes and dream it's allright
Mabye we'll make it together tonight.
