Howard:
Is it a truth? 
Or is it a fear? 
Is it a rose for my valentine? 
What is love? 
Is it only words? 
I'm trying to find? 
Or is it the way,that we're feeling now? 
What is love? 
If love is truth,then let it break my heart. 
If love is fear, lead me to the dark. 
If love is a game, I'm playing all my cards. 
What is love? 
A pain or a cure? 
A science of faith? 
A reason to fall to your knees and die? 
What is love? 
If love is truth,then let it break my heart. 
If love is fear, lead me to the dark. 
If love is a game, I'm playing all my cards. 
What is love? 
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Only you can save me now. 
Only you can heal me now. 
Only you can show me now, 
What is love?
Or is it a truth? 
Or is it a fear? 
Is it a rose for my valentine? 
What is love? 
What is love?
