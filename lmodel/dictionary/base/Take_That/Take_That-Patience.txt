<song artist="Take_That" title="Patience">
Just have a little patience
I'm still hurting from a love I lost
I'm feeling your frustration
But any minute all the pain will stop
Just hold me close
Inside your arms tonight
Don't be too hard on my emotions
'Cause I need time
My heart is numb, has no feeling
So while I'm still healing
Just try and have a little patience
I really wanna start over again
I know you wanna be my salvation
The one that I can always depend
I'll try to be strong
Believe me, I'm trying to move on
It's complicated but understand me
'Cause I need time
My heart is numb, has no feeling
So while I'm still healing
Just try and have a little patience, yeah
Have a little patience, yeah
'Cause these scars run so deep
It's been hard
But I have to believe
Have a little patience
Have a little patience
Whoa, 'cause I, I just need time
My heart is numb, has no feeling
So while I'm still healing
Just try, and have a little patience
Have a little patience
My heart is numb, has no feeling
So while I'm still healing
Just try and have a little...
Patience
