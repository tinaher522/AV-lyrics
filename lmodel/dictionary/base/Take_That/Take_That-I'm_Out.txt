<song artist="Take_That" title="I'm_Out">
I'm out
Doing all the things you wanted but baby you say
Can you do it this can you do it that while I'm away
In the top drawer there's a list of things that you need
Watcha gonna say watcha gonna do, baby I'll leave
(she's serious when she says) things that must be done before I come home
(she's serious when she says) no time for playing 'round
(I'm serious such a mess) such a mess I know it must be time now
(serious now's the time) to show you who I am
(I'm out)
Don't wanna see you no more
Don't wanna play your games
(I'm out)
You don't wanna believe me no more
You just gonna cause me pain
(I'm out)
Don't wanna see you no more
Don't wanna play your games
(I'm out)
This is the last time I'll be a player in your games
Said you couldn't think how you need to work like a slave
Baby don't get me too hot just to make me behave
Listen to me girl I whisper sweet stuff in your ear
Baby I'm out baby I'm gone catch you next year
(she's serious when she says) girl I don't know why it is I need you

(so serious when she says) no time to fool around
(I'm serious such a mess) such a mess I know it must be time now
(I'm serious now's the time) to show you who I am
(I'm out)
Don't wanna see you no more
Don't wanna play your games
(I'm out)
You don't wanna believe me no more
You just gonna cause me pain
(I'm out)
Don't wanna see you no more
Don't wanna play your games
(I'm out)
This is the last time I'll be a player in your games
(she's serious when she says) girl I don't know why it is I'm here
(so serious when she says) no time to fool around
(I'm serious such a mess) such a mess I know it must be time now
(serious now's the time) to show you who I am
(I'm out)
Don't wanna see you no more
Don't wanna play your games
(I'm out)
You don't wanna believe me no more
You just gonna cause me pain
(I'm out)
