<song artist="Take_That" title="The_Day_The_Work_Is_Done">
When all the work is done
The work is done
A place for everything til everything is in its place
And every setting sun
When the work was done
Was a day that didn't go to waste
When all the work is done
It will be done
Producing everything for everything to be replaced
And in dirty towns we will settle down
Manufacture for the human race
The greatest story that was ever told in the lights of history
Was the grand designs of other men
And they built those walls for you and me
So don't start thinking we can start again
Start a riot in the streets my friend
Or they'll start pulling us apart again
Cos idle hands make idle men
Don't start thinking with your heart again
Cos idle hands make idle men
When the work is done, the work is done
We'll be bionic and beyond the circuits of our minds
We'll get nothing done under electric sun
Leave the weight of labour far behind
We're the greatest story that was ever told
But we don't know where we're from
And the walls became but a memory
Of the days when all the work begun
So don't start thinking we can start again
Start a riot in the streets my friend
Or they'll start pulling us apart again
Cos idle hands make idle men
Rejoice the day, the day the work is done
Rejoice the day, the day the work is done
Everybody's counting hours
Everybody's counting hours
Til the day the work is done
Til the day the work is done
So don't start thinking we can start again
Start a riot in the streets my friend
Or they'll start pulling us apart again
Cos idle hands make idle men
So don't start thinking we can start again
Start a riot in the streets my friend
Or they'll start pulling us apart again
Cos idle hands make idle men
Rejoice the day, the day the work is done
Rejoice the day, the day the work is done
Everybody's counting hours
Everybody's counting hours
