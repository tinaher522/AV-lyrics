<song artist="Take_That" title="These_Days">
Oh I can see the future coming to you
Cry away the sadness in your eyes
And I can find a faith in days I've wasted
Been around enough to feel alive
And when the world is broken, hard and colder
No one even knows the reason why
For the ones we may become
For the battles we have won
For the day we reach the sun
Gonna play it loud tonight
When you dream of a dream 
And you live in the world
Every hope is a hope for the best 
And won't you rest on my bones
And you're calling me now
I was here all the time
Should be out there living the life
And not just watching oh
Take me back before we all explode
Before we turn to stone
Before the night is gone
Take me back to where it all began
To where our memories grow
Before they take us over
Tonight we gotta live for
We gotta live for
We gotta live for these days
Tonight, tonight
Remember, remember
Remember these days
What a day to believe
To believe in the night
What a day to belong to a face
In the crowd and the beat of your heart
And I'm already in 
And you're working it out
And you're holding us all in your hands
Oh what you waiting for
Take me back before we lose control
Before the tables turn
Before we break it all
Take me back to where it all began
To where our memories grow
Before they take us over
Tonight we gotta live for
We gotta live for
We gotta live for these days
Tonight, tonight
Remember, remember
Remember these days
Oh I can see the future coming to you
Cry away the sadness in your eyes
And I can find a faith in days I've wasted
Been around enough to feel alive
And when the world is broken, hard and colder
No one even knows the reason why
For the ones we may become
For the battles we have won
For the day we reach the sun
Gonna play it loud tonight
Tonight we gotta live for
We gotta live for
We gotta live for these days
Tonight, tonight
Remember, remember
Remember these days
Tonight, tonight
We gotta live for, we gotta live for
We gotta live for these days
Tonight, tonight
Remember, remember
Remember these days
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
These days
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
These days
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
These days
