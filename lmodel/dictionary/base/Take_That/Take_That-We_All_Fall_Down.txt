<song artist="Take_That" title="We_All_Fall_Down">
I'm better now,
I'm bigger than the man you made me
There you go, I think I'm Happy
I've seen the light, cut the ties for now I'm sober,
There's still so much to do before I hit the ground.
Oooh life, you can take your first steps
Walk into a brick wall, Try your best to stand tall, before you learn to crawl
Love is never easy unless its in a movie
But I'm not Jamie Dean, I said I'm not Jamie Dean.
And we all fall down out of the sky into the basement, looking for a way back up again
Yeah we all walk up slowly up the stairs onto the pavement, looking for the place where we belong
The place where we belong.
I smile again, 
I haven't smoked now for a whole day
I think I've given up.
I love that song, the one that says how I wish you were here,

But I'm back on the ground, I can't wait another year.
Oooh life, you can take your first steps
Walk into a brick wall, 
Try your best to stand tall, before you learn to crawl
Love is never easy, only in some poetry.
But I'm not Oscar Wilde, I said I'm not Oscar Wilde
And we all fall down out of the sky into the basement, looking for a way back up again
Yeah we all walk slowly up the stairs onto the pavement, looking for the place where we belong
The place where we belong.
Oooh oooh oooh, yeaahhh.
And we all fall down out of the sky into the basement, looking for a way back up again 
Yeah we all walk slowly up the stairs onto the pavement, looking for the place, the place where we belong
Looking for a way, looking for a way back up again
And we all walk slowly up the stairs onto the pavement, looking for the place...
The place where we belong.
