<song artist="Take_That" title="Into_The_Wild">
Up tight, tied up again
Tied up again with my one and only friend
Your voice is all I can hear
All I can hear it’s the music to my ears
Staying out of trouble staying in and out of touch
In and out of touch I can never get enough
Up tight, tied up again 
Some things will never change
It’s almost like we go
Dance with desire then we go playing with fire
Then we go into the wild again
It’s almost like we go
Dance with desire then we go playing with fire
Then we go into the wild again
Get back, get back to town
These city lights gonna bring us home tonight
'Cause we knew the color of gold
So long ago it’s a story to be told
Staying out of trouble staying in and out of touch
In and out of touch I can never get enough
Get back, get back to town
Please come around tonight
It’s almost like we go
Dance with desire then we go playing with fire
Then we go into the wild again
Into the wild again
Into the wild again
Let me run with you
Let me run with you my friend
Let me be with you
Running through the wild again
Let me run with you
Let me run with you my friend
Let me be with you
Running to the wild again
It’s almost like we go
Dance with desire then we go playing with fire
Then we go into the wild again
Into the wild
Into the wild again
Into the wild
Into the wild again
Into the wild
