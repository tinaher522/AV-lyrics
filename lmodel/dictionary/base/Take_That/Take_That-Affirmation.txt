<song artist="Take_That" title="Affirmation">
It's just a fraction of time?
Until we move in reverse?
Can feel the pressure on all our minds,
And the whole Universe.
Is it a question of force?
A metaphysical law?
We've had this battle a thousand times,
Never been here before,
And never been here before.
Ain't got the strength to fight anymore,
Got no desire to die anymore,
I need an affirmation,
I want to see you again, again, again.
Ain't got the strength to fight anymore,
Don't even know what I'm fighting you for
I need an affirmation.
I need an affirmation.
We're at the end of a line
at the start of a race
I want to swim where the water falls
Off the edge of your face
I'm reaching out for the light
Past the silhouette of you
In the cold reflection of time
Is a point of view
Is a point of view
Can you see me, like I see you?
Can you see me, like I see you?
Can you see me, like I see you?
Ain't got the strength to fight anymore
Got not desire to die anymore
I need an affirmation
I wanna see you again, again, again
Ain't got no strength to fight anymore
Don't even know what I'm fighting you for
I need an affirmation
I need an affirmation
I wanna fill you with love
I wanna see you survive
Just take a second to know yourself
For the rest of your life.
We're just a minute away
From the place that we wanna be
We're not really falling appart, we're just incomplete
We're not really falling appart, we're just incomplete
We're just incomplete
We're just incomplete
I need an affirmation
I need an affirmation
I need an affirmation
I need an affirmation
I wanna see you again, again, again, again, again
