<song artist="Take_That" title="Hate_It">
Hate it but I love her
Hate it but I need her
Feeling like I need her
Our love, our love was true
There is the time I feel it
here in the middle of the night
still wide awake and feeling cheated
from a girl I thought was treating me right
Hate it but I love her
Hate it but I need her
Feeling like I need her
Our love, our love was true
Gotta get away from all the feelings that I had
be real, you won't be seeing her again
it's complicated when you're feeling so bad 
and your girl is still walking away 
Hate it but I love her
Hate it but I need her
Feeling like I need her
Our love, our love was true
