<song artist="Take_That" title="84">
'84 was  a pretty good year
I lost my heart back then in 
1984 was a pretty good year
I lost my heart to 1984.
It was 1984 and 
I was nearly 16 years old
Thatcher was the minister in charge
All the miners were on strike and
My dad had gone away
And the Smiths were riding high up in the charts.
It was there on Rodal(?) Road
While I was waiting in the cold
For my mate when you came along
And heaven knows that it was like a heart attack
That year when you said to me
"If you give a little bit more,
Just a little bit more,
You'll get a little bit more.
If you try a little bit harder,
Just a little bit harder,
Then you'll get it for sure
You'll get it for sure"
I was nervous, I was sweating
Seemed like she was on a mission
When she took me by the hand up to her room
There were posters on her wall
I saw flowers in her hair
But I never got the chance to see them bloom
'Cause the clocks stopped
And the years rolled by
But the time never
Left my mind.
When she said:
"If you give a little bit more,
Just a little bit more,
You'll get a little bit more.
If you try a little bit harder,
Just a little bit harder,
Then you'll get it for sure
You'll get it for sure"
24 years later and
We're in the hands of Labour
And we've got 10,000 troops out in Iraq
I am living now in London
And at present I am single
And it took my dad a long time to come back.
'84 was  a pretty good year
I lost my heart back then in 
1984 was a pretty good year
I lost my heart to 1984.
If you give a little bit more,
Just a little bit more,
You'll get a little bit more.
If you try a little bit harder,
Just a little bit harder,
Then you'll get it for sure
You'll get it for sure
