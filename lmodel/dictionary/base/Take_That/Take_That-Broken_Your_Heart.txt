<song artist="Take_That" title="Broken_Your_Heart">
Broken, broken
(Heart)
Broken, broken
(Heart)
Broken, broken
Broken your heart
It's good to be near you, even though I'm alone
Reviving memories of our happy home
No sign of sunlight since you ran away
These rooms get darker now every day
Even though I have broken
Even though I have broken
Even though I have broken your heart
Will you still love me?
Though I have broken
Will you still love me?
Though I have broken
Even though I have broken your heart
The consequences of freedom
But now you have what you dreamed
Just understand that things are not as they seem
Even though I have broken
Even though I have broken
Even though I have broken your heart
Will you still love me?
Though I have broken
Will you still love me?
Though I have broken
Even though I have broken your heart
I don't wanna be lonely
Because you're not there for me to be
I don't wanna be lonely
I wanna be loved
Even though I have broken
Even though I have broken
Even though I have broken your heart
Will you still love me?
Though I have broken
Will you still love me?
Though I have broken
Though I have broken your
Even though I have broken your heart
Will you still love me?
Though I have broken
Will you still love me?
Though I have broken
Even though I have broken your heart
