<song artist="Take_That" title="Never_Forget">
(And we've come so far,
And we've reached so high,
And we've looked each day and night in the eye,
And we're still so young,
And we hope for more)
Howard:
We've come a long way
But we're not too sure where we've been
We've had success
We've had good times
But remember this...
Been on this path of life for so long,
Feel I've walked a thousand miles,
Sometimes strolled hand in hand with love,
Everybody's been there,
With danger on my mind I would stand on the line of hope,
And I knew I could make it,
Once I knew the boundaries I looked into the clouds and saw,
My face in the moonlight,
Just then I realised what a fool I could be,
Just 'cause I looked so high, I don't have to see me,
Finding a paradise wasn't easy but still,
There's a road going down the other side of this hill
(Never) 
Forget where you've come here from,
(Never) 
Pretend that it's all real,
(Someday) 
Soon this will all be someone else's dream,
This will be someone else's dream
Safe from the arms of disappointment for so long,
Feel each day we've come too far,
Yet each day seems to make much more,
Sure is good to be here,
I understand the meaning of "I can't explain this feeling" now,
And it feels so unreal,
At night I see the hand that reminds me of the stand that I make,
The fact of reality
(Never)
Forget where you've come here from,
(Never)
Pretend that it's all real,
(Someday)
Soon this will all be someone else's dream,
This will be someone else's dream
Jason:
And we've come so far,
And we've reached so high,
Howard:
And we've looked each day and night in the eye,
Mark:
And we're still so young,
And we hope for more,
Gary:
But remember this,
We're not invincible, 
We're not invincible -
We're only people, 
We're only people,
Robbie:
Hey we're not invincible,  
We're not invincible,
Howard:
So again I'll tell you,
Howard:
(Never)
Forget where you've come here from,
(Never)
Pretend that it's all real,
(Someday)
Soon this will all be someone else's dream,
This will be someone else's dream
(Never)
Never forget it
(Never)
Pretend that it's all real,
(Someday)
Soon this will all be someone else's dream,
This will be someone else's dream
(Never)
Robbie:
Everybody sing baby
(Never)
Howard:
No never, never forget no no
(Someday)
Robbie:
Louder, louder, louder now
Oh oh
(Never)
Robbie:
Everybody sing that song
(Never)
Robbie:
Yeah, louder, louder, louder now
(Someday)
Robbie:
Come on, come on, everybody, everybody
Everybody, everybody, everybody
Howard:
(Never)
Forget where you've come here from,
(Never)
Pretend that it's all real,
(Someday)
Soon this will all be someone else's dream,
This will be someone else's dream
(And we've come so far,
And we've reached so high,
And we've looked each day and night in the eye,
And we're still so young,
And we hope for more)
