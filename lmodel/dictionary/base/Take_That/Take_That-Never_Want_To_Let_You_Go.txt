<song artist="Take_That" title="Never_Want_To_Let_You_Go">
Lying here beside you, in a cloud of warmth
I've been awake all night but don't move
Though I know I should
Counting curls in your hair, as you sleep so tight
I wonder if you'll ever know how you stimulate my life
I don't know where I'm going to be going babe
I'll never know 'til I go
The chances are you'll be there too some day
We'll never know, let's hope
Never wanna let you go
Never wanna let you go
All I can do is hope
'Cause I never wanna let you go
Dreaming soft in silence, been working hard all day
Still in the night grows darker
I'm with you in every way
I don't know where I'm going to be going babe
I'll never know 'til I go
The chances are you'll be there too some day
We'll never know, let's hope
I don't know whether I'm trying to love, love you baby
Been round long enough to know
