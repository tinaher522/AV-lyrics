(Complicated - fractious - twisted - ego - circus - disappointed - curious - alive - tortured - awkward - patient - addicted - fragile - foolish - man)
Giving up too much
Giving up
(Be gracious, be thankful)
Giving up too much
Giving up
(Be honest, be kind)
We're waiting for the universe
We're waiting for the light to lead the way
Creating what we can't reverse
Nothing will ever be the same again
You held it all, you had it all, you lost control and let it go again
We're waiting for the universe to end
You're much too strong for me and I can't hold your hand like I used to
You're much too hard for me and I can't change your heart like I used to
And all that's left to say to you is to smile when the lights are on
This never was enough for you, now we both know where we belong
Giving up too much. Giving up too much
I've never given this much to another no, not to another lover
Giving up too much. Giving up too much
I've never given so much, never given so much away
We're waiting for the universe
We're waiting for the light to lead the way
Creating what we can't reverse
Nothing will ever be the same again
You held it all, you had it all, you lost control and let it go again
We're waiting for the universe to end
Goodbye. Good Night, my love
Goodbye my love
We're waiting for the universe
We're waiting for the light to lead the way
Creating what we can't reverse
Nothing will ever be the same again
You held it all, you had it all, you lost control and let it go again
We're waiting for the universe to end
We're waiting for the universe to end
