<song artist="Take_That" title="Beautiful_World">
Howard:
Here standing in the rain
The sun has gone again and nothing's gonna change
Time, I need a little time as you slip out of sight
And nothing heals the pain.
And I know that it's you that's stopping me from falling
Crashing down, losing ground 'til I see you again
And you know...
All:
The sun will shine, and we will see there's nothing standing in our way
Love will stand and never break
Never thought this could be me
Do you feel what I feel?
Every time that you are near, it's a beautiful world
A beautiful world
Howard:
Words are hard to keep inside
Even though I've tried, 
Impossible to hide.
And you know that it's me that's stopping you from falling
Crushing down, losing ground til I see you again
And you know...
All:
The sun will shine, and we will see there's nothing standing in our way
Love will stand and never break
Never thought this could be me
Do you feel what I feel?
Everytime that you are near it's a beautiful world
A beautiful world
Howard:
I'll be the stars guiding you
I'll be the place that you hide
I'd run a thousand miles, a thousand miles to be by your side.
All:
The sun will shine, and we will see there's nothing standing in our way
Love will stand and never break
Never thought this could be me
Do you feel what I feel?
Everytime that you are near it's a beautiful world
A beautiful world
Do you feel what I feel?
Everytime that you are near it's a beautiful world
A beautiful world
it's a beautiful world
A beautiful world
it's a beautiful world
A beautiful world
it's a beautiful world
