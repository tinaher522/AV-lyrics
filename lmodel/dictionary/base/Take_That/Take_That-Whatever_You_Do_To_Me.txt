<song artist="Take_That" title="Whatever_You_Do_To_Me">
ooooh no
ooh oh hoo ooh
I'm mad at you
I'm mad at you,
because of all the things you do,
I want you to see,
the way your games are hurting me,
so why,
did I ever fall in love with you,
you're all,
of my nightmares and dreams come true,
now what can I do,
to make you talk this problem through,
you said you've nothing to hide,
so let me hear your feelings inside,
I never dreamed,
that I see this kind of thing in my life,
so baby please,
let me go,
let me go,
Whatever you do to me,
somebody else will do to you,
however you break my heart,
somebody else will break your too,
Now all I can see,
are staring eyes and mystery,
I've tried to look behind,
before you take my dignity and pride,
sit and talk all night,
still you never seem to lose your hide,
and you believe in yourself,
hope I'm never gonna need your help,
Whatever you do to me,
somebody else will do to you,
however you break my heart,
somebody else will break yours too,
