<song artist="Take_That" title="Promises">
Standing back I can't believe how you've led me on 
And judging by the things you say 
There's gotta be something wrong 
CHORUS: 
What you telling me that for you don't mean it 
What you telling me that for I don't believe it 
Your promises have never been anything you made them seem 
So what you gonna promise me this time 
You're telling lies so plain to see, you're trying to make a fool of me 
So what you gonna promise me this time 
I wanna know 
Seems that I've been playing your game 
And how you think you've won 
But when you count up what you've gained you're the lonely one 
CHORUS x 2 
I'll never know 
What you telling me for
