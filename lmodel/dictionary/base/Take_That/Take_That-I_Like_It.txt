<song artist="Take_That" title="I_Like_It">
Oh there are people here
So many people here looking back at me
Feel the energy
Oh they call my name
Oh they call my name it’s the loudest noise
And it’s all for me
Yeah it’s all for me
Yeah when it’s all for me
I can get away to a better place
Hey I’m looking down
Yeah I’m looking down
I can see you now
Are you coming out
There’s a voice in my head
And it’s talking again
Out of time, out of space
It’s a feeling a meaning that I can taste
I don’t know what people see but I like it (I like it), I like it (I like it)
I don’t know why people give but I’ll take it (I’ll take it), I’ll take it (I’ll take it)
(Hey!)
Hey, I’m back again
Yeah I’m back again in another place
I can see your face
Oh let me hear you now, yeah let me hear you now
Let me hear you loud, make a bigger sound
There’s a voice in my ear
The intention is clear
Out of time, out of space
It’s a feeling a meaning that I can taste
I don’t know what people see but I like it (I like it), I like it (I like it)
I don’t know why people give but I’ll take it (I’ll take it), I’ll take it (I’ll take it)
Everybody’s looking for
Someone that they can adore
Give them what they came here for
Always leave them wanting more
Everybody’s looking for
Someone that they can adore
Give them what they came here for
Always leave them wanting more
Everybody’s looking for
Someone that they can adore
Give them what they came here for
Always leave them wanting more
Everybody’s looking for
Someone that they can adore
Give them what they came here for
Always leave them wanting more
I don’t know what people see but I like it (I like it), I like it (I like it)
I don’t know why people give but I’ll take it (I’ll take it), I’ll take it (I’ll take it)
I don’t know what people see but I like it (I like it), I like it (I like it)
I don’t know why people give but I’ll take it (I’ll take it), I’ll take it (I’ll take it)
