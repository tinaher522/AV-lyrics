<song artist="Take_That" title="Here">
Up and Down, I love a merry-go-round
You went your way, I went my way
Said, you'll see me
Down life's highway
Not black or white
As crystal clear as a cloudy night
Traveling in the name of lonely
I was only home when you held me
Yeah, it's a hell, a hell of a time
To emerge from the shadows
Yeah it's a hell, a hell of a time
To come knocking at my door
And it's here
Where I've come home to
Right here, everything I hold on to is here
All the things I keep so dear
Flying home tonight
As far away as a satellite
Keeping your heart in my pocket
Hope to God that I don't drop it
Yeah, it's a hell, a hell of a time
To emerge from the shadows
Yeah it's a hell, a hell of a time
To come bursting through my door
And it's here
Where I've come home to
Right here, everything I hold on to is here
All the things I keep so dear I hear
Oh, what a time to come back
Oh, what a time to come home
Oh, what a time to come back
Oh, what a time 
Up and Down, I love a merry-go-round
You went your way, I went my way
Said, you'll see me
Down life's highway
And it's here
Where I've come home to
Right here, everything I hold on to is here
All the things I keep so dear I hear
Everybody's talking now
Everybody's walking 'round
Everybody's dreaming 'bout
