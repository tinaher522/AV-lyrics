<song artist="Take_That" title="Aliens">
Alien alien alien alien alien alien alien alien
through the carnage of the crash
Baby I'm with you
And the photos in the flash
Baby I'm with you
Through violent seas
Baby I'm with you
Until release 
Baby I'm with you
And all the animals in the park
Are waiting for their dinner to come
And all the creatures in the dark
Are waiting for the light to come on
We are the aliens, we are, we are, we are alien
God loves the aliens, we are, we are, we are alien
All the animals in the park, alien
And all the strangers that wake up the in the dark
Are waiting for the light to come on
Alien alien
Through electronic desire
Baby I'm with you
And the elements of fire
Baby I'm with you
Through everything
Baby I'm with you
All the counterfeited scream tonight
When all the elevated 
Become illuminated
We are the aliens, we are, we are, we are alien
God loves the aliens, we are, we are, we are alien
All the animals in the park, alien
And all the strangers that wake up in the dark
Are waiting for the light to come on
Alien alien alien alien alien alien alien
We are alien, alien
We are alien, alien
We ware the aliens, we are, we are, we are alien
God loves the aliens, we are, we are, we are alien
All the animals in the park, alien
(We ware the aliens, we are, we are, we are alien)
And all the strangers that wake up in the dark
(God loves the aliens, we are, we are, we are alien)
Alien
