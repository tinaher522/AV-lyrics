<song artist="Take_That" title="Do_What_You_Like">
Sugar sweet, if only they all knew
Jam, can't spread no more you've took my bread
Energy, just work, no rest or play
Me, myself I'd rather be alone again
So you can do what you like (Do what you like)
No need to ask me (Do what you like)
Do what you like (Do what you like)
No need to tell me (Do what you like)
Cherry pie, you're not as cute as me
Ice, could never be as cold as you
Recipe, you stir me up inside
Me, myself I'd rather be alone again
So you can do what you like (Do what you like)
No need to ask me (Do what you like)
Do what you like (Do what you like)
No need to tell me (Do what you like)
So you can do what you like (Do what you like)
No need to ask me (Do what you like)
Do what you like (Do what you like)
No need to tell me (Do what you like)
