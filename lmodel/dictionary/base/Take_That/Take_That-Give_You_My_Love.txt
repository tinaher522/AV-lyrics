<song artist="Take_That" title="Give_You_My_Love">
When the walls are closing in
And you’re standing in the dark
Don’t know where you can begin
All the pressure on your heart
Heavy load inside your head
No more colour in the sky
I’ll be lying in your bed
Happy being here until I die
I see light just around the corner
Make sense of it all when we’re together
I see you surrender put your hands up
You’ll be safe with me
I’m going to give you my love
Know that my affection
I’m going to give you my love
Comes with my protection
I wanna give you my love
You are my addiction
I wanna give you my love
I can’t give you up
I’m gonna give you my love
Know that I will listen
I’m gonna give you my love
My love no condition
I wanna give you my love
All of my decision
I wanna give you my love
I can’t give you up
We’re gonna make it to the end
Even longer if we try
We gonna find a place to land
There’ll be danger but we will survive
I see light just around the corner
Make sense of it all when we’re together
I see you surrender put your hands up
You’ll be safe with me
I’m going to give you my love
Know that my affection
I’m going to give you my love
Comes with my protection
I wanna give you my love
You are my addiction
I wanna give you my love
I can’t give you up
I’m gonna give you my love
Know that I will listen
I’m gonna give you my love
My love no condition
I wanna give you my love
All of my decision
I wanna give you my love
I can’t give you up
Don’t ever think about that
I will never hold you back
Spread your wings butterfly
'Cause I’ll be here till the day I die
Till the day that I die
I’m going to give you my love
Know that my affection
I’m going to give you my love
Comes with my protection
I wanna give you my love
You are my addiction
I wanna give you my love
I can’t give you up
I’m gonna give you my love
Know that I will listen
I’m gonna give you my love
My love no condition
I wanna give you my love
All of my decision
I wanna give you my love
I can’t give you up
