<song artist="Take_That" title="Still_Can't_Get_Over_You">
With my hand in my pocket 
I wave us off goodbye 
With the hand that once touched you 
Dried your tears when you cried 
Oh I must've loved you 
I used to tell you all the time 
Ten times a day and fifty times each night 
Still I wait for your reply 
I reach to feel your pillow 
I move in close and close my eyes 
But it's just the end of one more lonely dream 
Just the end of one more lonely night 
Even after all this time 
Still can't get over you 
Even after all this time 
Still can't get over you 
Still can't get over you 
For a moment you were with me 
For a moment you were mine 
Then the darkness comes and takes you far away 
Before I even said goodbye 
Even after all this time 
Still can't get over you 
Even after all this time 
Still can't get over you 
Still can't get over you
