<song artist="Take_That" title="Hello">
Mark:
I'd watch the world go by in the morning 
Lose myself in the news, 
Looks like the cost of houses are falling, but I don't notice 
I'd write a long love song with no meaning and hope nobody would hear, 
A life of filter coffee and dreaming, dreaming.
Never thought that anyone could change my view 
But everything looks different when I'm looking around with you.
All:
Glad you took the time to say hello, hello. 
Now I don't ever wanna let you go, oh no, 
All the bells are ringing out, all the birds are singing out, 
Glad you took the time to say hello, oh oh oh.
Mark:
I'd lock myself away in the evening, 
Afraid to ever come out, 
Watch TV and get lost in my feelings, feelings.
Never thought that anyone could change my view 
But everything looks different when I'm looking around with you
All:
Glad you took the time to say hello, hello. 
Now I don't ever wanna let you go, oh no, 
All the bells are ringing out, all the birds are singing out, 
Glad you took the time to say hello, oh oh oh.
Mark:
It's a lovely day, it's a lovely day
Never thought that anyone could change my view 
But everything looks different when I'm looking with you
All:
Glad you took the time to say hello, oh hello 
Now I don't ever wanna let you go, let you go, 
All the bells are ringing out, all the birds are singing out, 
Glad you took the time to say hello, oh oh oh, 
Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, 
All the bells are ringing out, all the birds are singing out 
Glad you took the time to say hello, oh oh oh hello.
