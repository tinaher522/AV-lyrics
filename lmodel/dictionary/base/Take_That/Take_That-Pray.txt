<song artist="Take_That" title="Pray">
When the time grew near
For me to show my love
The longer I stayed away for
Hiding from a word I need to hear now
Don't think I'll hear it again (don't think I'll hear it again)
But the nights were always warm with you
Holding you right by my side (right by my side)
But the morning always comes too soon
Before I even close my eyes (my eyes)
All I do each night is pray
Hoping that I'll be a part of you again some day
All I do each night is think
Of all the times I closed the door to keep my love within
If you can't forgive the past
I'll understand that
Can't understand why I did this to you
And all of the days and the nights so I regret it 
I never showed you my love (I never showed you my love)
But the nights were always warm with you (my love)
Holding you right by my side (right by my side)
But the morning always comes too soon
Before I even close my eyes (my eyes)
All I do each night is pray
Hoping that I'll be a part of you again some day
All I do each night is think
Of all the times I closed the door to keep my love within
Surely we must be in sight
Of the dream we long to live (we long to live)
If you stop and close your eyes
You'll picture me inside
I'm so cold and all alone
Straight on back to me
All I do each night is pray
Hoping that I'll be a part of you again some day
All I do each night is think
Of all the times I closed the door to keep my love within
Come on
Time is running out
You and me
Harmony
You and me...
You and me..
Forever more
That's what I told you
