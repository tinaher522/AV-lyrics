<song artist="Take_That" title="Stay_Together">
Oh love tell me now
Is there room for me in your company
Cause my heart aches
To see yours break
Can we both pick up the pieces
Lets just try to stay together 
Find a way to make it better
Maybe, you and me baby 
Lets just try to work it out
We've come too far to give up now
Baby dont let me down. 
Oh love hear me now
Could you put a good word in somehow
Cause i have tried from time to time
Let her find some faith in me
Lets just try to stay together 
Find a way to make it better
Maybe, you and me baby 
Lets just try to work it out
We've come too far to give up now
Baby dont let me down. 

Cause i cant lie that im not scared
Im turning into someone else
Im twisting up inside
Dont tell me please, dont tell me now, dont tell me its over
Lets just try to stay together 
Find a way to make it better
Maybe you and me baby 
Lets just try to work it out
We've come too far to give up now
Baby dont you let me down. 
Dont tell me please, dont tell me now, dont tell me its over
Lets just try to stay together 
Find a way to make it better.
Lets just try to stay together 
Find a way to make it better.
Lets just try to stay together 
Find a way to make it better.
Lets just try to stay together
Find a way to make it better.
