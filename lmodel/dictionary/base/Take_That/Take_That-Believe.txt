<song artist="Take_That" title="Believe">
Took a walk around the block
Didn’t stop, all this space
It makes me want to see your face
Such a beautiful place
When I met you last I was at a loss
Life goes on
Breakin’ hard into the ground
It was you that I found
I can run if you are callin’
I can fly if you are fallin’
I can break through every wall they build for me
I can see the sun is risin’
I can see your eyes are smilin’
I will hold onto the things that I believe
Believe
Shut my eyes I feel alive
Hold me back
In our hearts, we’ll wear the scars
Of the wilderness years
Give me one more night at last
Filled with joy
When your guard is down
And you’re hand in hand
Will you understand how lucky we are
It’s been a very long day
I can run if you are callin’
I can fly if you are fallin’
I can break through every wall they build for me
I can see the sun is risin’
I can see your eyes are smilin’
I will hold onto the things that I believe
Believe
When your guard is down
And you’re hand in hand
Will you understand how lucky we are
It’s been a very long day
I can run if you are callin’
I can fly if you are fallin’
I can break through every wall they build for me
(Believe)
I can see the sun is risin’
I can see your eyes are smilin’
I will hold onto the things that I believe
Believe
Tell me now if this is real
Close your eyes and you will see
Tell me now won't let me go
Let me know if you believe
Tell me now if this is real
Close your eyes and you will see
Tell me now won't let me go
Let me know if you believe
