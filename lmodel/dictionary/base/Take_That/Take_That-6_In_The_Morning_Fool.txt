<song artist="Take_That" title="6_In_The_Morning_Fool">
I walk along these tired
streets
That I walked the night before
I cleared my head a thousand times
Whilst staring at your door
I tore up your photograph
And found myself taping it back together again
Can we start again?
'Cause the road is cold
And the sun's too bright
And the sunglasses on my face
I can't hide behind
I can't hide behind
This is my wake-up calling
This is my way of falling
Back into love with you
I'm a 6 in the morning fool
My feet are tired of walkin'
my words are tired of talkin'
I'm back in love with you
I'm a 6 in the morning fool
Days are nights and nights are days
And what are afternoons?
My only company is staring at the evening news
My friends try to take me out
To talk to me out of you and me getting together again
Yeah, they call themselves friends
All the lights are out
And the stores are closed
But the day is coming
And I'm the only one that knows
I'm the only one that knows
This is my wake-up calling
This is my way of falling
Back into love with you
I'm a 6 in the morning fool
My feet are tired of walkin'
my words are tired of talkin'
I'm back in love with you
I'm a 6 in the morning fool
Baby could you come outside
We can watch the rest arrive
Even if you say goodbye
I know that I have tried
I've tried to tell you
Got to tell you
This is my wake-up calling
This is my way of falling
Back into love with you
I'm a 6 in the morning fool
My feet are tired of walkin'
my words are tired of talkin'
I'm back in love with you
I'm a 6 in the morning fool
Yeah, yeah
I'm a 6 in the morning fool
This is my wake-up calling
This is my way of falling
Back into love with you
I'm a 6 in the morning fool
My feet are tired of walkin'
my words are tired of talkin'
I'm back in love with you
I'm a 6 in the morning fool
