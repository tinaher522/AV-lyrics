<song artist="Take_That" title="Flowerbed">
And all the sky is turning blue
If I could only get past you
Then I would know what we've got here
Maybe see where we live
If I could only rearrange with you
Soldier the plans and try to change
Then I might feel like your hero
Coming home from war
Then I might understand
How I ended up a man
Darling, please forgive me
I was sitting on the fence
I was slowly going out of my head
I did not hear a word that you said
I was enjoying myself sleeping in your flowerbed
If I could take your blows, If I could get past go,
If I could find a way of fixing all the things that I broke
Then I would, if I could
And I might understand how I ended up a man
And I might understand how I ended up a man
But the truth is hard to find
When itâ€™s playing tricks with your mind
Darling, please forgive me
I was hanging with my friends
I was slowly getting outta my head
I did not hear a word that you said
I was enjoying myself sleeping in your flowerbed
I was enjoying myself sleeping in your flowerbed
