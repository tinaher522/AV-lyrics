<song artist="Naughty_Boy" title="Dreams">
Dreams can come true
Look at me babe if I'm with you
You know you gotta have hope
You know you've got to be strong
Move a step closer
You know that i want you
I can tell by your eyes
That you want me too
Just a question of time
I knew we'd be together
And that you'd be mine
I want you here forever
Do you hear what I'm saying
Gotta say how I feel
I can't believe you're here
But I know that you're real
I know what I want
And baby it's you
I can't deny my feelings
'cause I know they are true
I've seen you sometimes
On your own and in crowds
I knew I had to have you
My hopes didn't let me down
Now you're by my side
And I feel so good
I've nothing to hide
Don't feel that I ever could
Do you hear what I'm saying
Gotta say how I feel
I can't believe you;re here
But I know that you're real
I know what I want
And baby it's you
Can't deny my feelings
Because they are true
I'm not making plans for tomorrow
Let's live for tonight
I know I want you baby
So hold me so tight
Put your arms around me
You make me feel so safe
Then you whisper in my ear
That you're here to stay
