<song artist="Naughty_Boy" title="Wonder_(Kidnap_Kid_Remix)">
I can beat the night
I'm not afraid of thunder
I am full of light
I am full of wonder
Though our feet might ache
The world's upon our shoulders
No way we gon' break
We are full of wonder
... we are full of wonder
... we ain't falling under
When everything feels wrong
And darkness falls upon you
Just try sing along
This is a message from Cabana
If your heart turns blue
I want you to remember
This song is for you
And you are full of wonder
... we are full of wonder
... we ain't falling under
And you are full of wonder
