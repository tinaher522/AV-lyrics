<song artist="Naughty_Boy" title="No_One's_Here_To_Sleep">
Every carpet, every floor
Everywhere I look, I fall
Climbing up the walls, I'm climbing up the walls
What goes on behind these doors?
I'll keep mine and you keep yours
We all have our secrets, we all have our secrets
Behind every door is a fall, a fall
And no one's here to sleep
You were always faster than me
I'll never catch up with you, with you
Oh, I can feel them coming for me
You were always faster than me
I'll never catch up with you, with you
Oh, I can feel them coming for me
Here's the pride before the fall
Oh, your eyes they show it all
I can see it coming, I can see it coming
As I rise up through each floor
Shit gets dark when you lose it all
I can hear it coming, I can hear the drumming
Behind every door is a fall, a fall
And no one's here to sleep
You were always faster than me
I'll never catch up with you, with you
Oh, I can feel them coming for me
You were always faster than me
I'll never catch up with you, with you
Oh, I can feel them coming for me
You were always faster than me
I'll never catch up with you, with you
Oh, I can feel them coming for me
You were always faster than me
I'll never catch up with you, with you
Oh, I can feel them coming for me
You were always faster than me
I will always catch up with you
