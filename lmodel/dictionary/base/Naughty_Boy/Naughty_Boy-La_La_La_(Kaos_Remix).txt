<song artist="Naughty_Boy" title="La_La_La_(Kaos_Remix)">
Hush, don't speak
When you spit your venom, keep it shut I hate it
When you hiss and preach
About your new messiah 'cause your theories catch fire
I can't find those silver linings
I don't mean to judge
But when you read your speech, it's tiring
Enough is enough
I'm covering my ears like a kid
When your words mean nothing, I go la la la
I'm turning up the volume when you speak
Cause if my heart can't stop it, I find a way to block it, I go
I find a way to block it, I go
I can't stop it, I find a way to block it, I go
Oh, oh, oh...
Enough is enough
Enough is enough
I'm covering my ears like a kid
When your words mean nothing, I go la la la
I'm turning up the volume when you speak
Cause if my heart can't stop it, I find a way to block it, I go
Oh, oh, oh...
