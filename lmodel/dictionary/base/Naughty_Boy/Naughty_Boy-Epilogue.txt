<song artist="Naughty_Boy" title="Epilogue">
How do I create annotations?
Take a step back, try and read the signs
You paid the price, looking for the cheapest flights
But you made the right booking for the sleepless nights
If you're still intrigued, don't hold me responsible
Leave your conscience at the outlets indicated
You ain't drowsy, baby, you've been sedated
Just don't end up like the rest of them
The things this place has instigated
