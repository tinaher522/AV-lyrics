<song artist="Naughty_Boy" title="Act_I">
Welcome to Hotel Cabana
Ask no questions, you'll hear fewer lies
Until the few unavoidable ones do arrive
Just try not to mention money and suicides and
If you see the boss don't look into his eyes
This place sets the date for your next mistake so
Up we step the pace, you've got fresh regrets to make
Keep your wits about you
The struggle between good and evil is about you
