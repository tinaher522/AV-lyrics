<song artist="Naughty_Boy" title="Top_Floor_(Cabana)">
I can see the city life
From where I stand on the top floor
But I'm not sure if I'm dead
I raise my hands to the clouds
To check if heaven is with me now
Cause the devil's in my bed
And she won't love me like she could
She won't hold me like you would
I bid this city goodnight
And colored street lamps spark my eyes
When it's quiet I'll go
And say my sweetest goodbye
Under billboards of fast food and mobile phones
Cause they won't treat me like they should
Cause they don't need me like you would
My toes curl, clutched to the edge
I'm filled up with regret
Could you forgive me yet?
Would you know if I fell
From this hotel?
