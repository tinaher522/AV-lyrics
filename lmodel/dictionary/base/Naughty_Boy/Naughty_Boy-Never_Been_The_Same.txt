<song artist="Naughty_Boy" title="Never_Been_The_Same">
Who would've thought?
See, I never would've guessed
Like pieces of a puzzle
That we would click together
Never was a question of what I had, no
But instead you made me ask myself who I am
What's hot in a cold world? Who cares
And even if they never followed us, who cares
Was it just a fashion fad?
But you were my style
When everyone else was the same,
You raised eyebrows, style
And ever since I haven't been the same
Ooh ahh ahh
And ever since I haven't been the same
Ooh ahh ahh
It's a shame we fell apart
We could've been more amazing
Crashed after we discovered
Our very own lane
You rubbed off on me in ways I can't erase
And I wouldn't have it any other way
What's hot in a cold world? Who cares
And even if they never followed us, who cares
Was it just a fashion fad?
But you were my style
When everyone else was the same,
You raised eyebrows, style
And ever since I haven't been the same
Ooh ahh ahh
And ever since I haven't been the same
Ooh ahh ahh
And ever since I haven't been the same
Ooh ahh ahh
And ever since I haven't been the same
