<song artist="Naughty_Boy" title="Pardon_Me">
Ohh, darlin'
(Ohh)
Excuse me if I'm fillin' up your inbox with my messages
Every now &amp; then I think I make a mess
I can't even try &amp; keep control
The other night, heaven knows I'm smashing things, I'm madder now
Fallin' in the wilderness, I'm wild'n out
I've been caught dyin' on your floor
Pardon me, but you said that you'd always love me
So how come you're tryna' run from me?
Pardon me, pardon me. Pardon me
Pardon me, but you said you'd always talk to me
So how come you're keepin' things from me?
Pardon me, pardon me
Excuse me if I hate way too much of me for you to commit
And that our hearts together weren't the perfect fit
Sorry I couldn't make a house a home
Excuse me if everything I promised didn't manifest;
Everything we had, it turned out counterfeit
Sorry I couldn't make a house a home
Pardon me, but you said that you'd always love me
So how come you're tryna' run from me?
Pardon me, pardon me. Pardon me
Pardon me, but you said you'd always talk to me
So how come you're keepin' things from me?
Pardon me, pardon me
Pardon me, but you said that you'd always love me
So how come you're tryna' run from me?
Pardon me, pardon me. Pardon me
Pardon me, but you said you'd always talk to me
So how come you're keepin' things from me?
Pardon me, pardon me
Ohh
You said that you'd always love me
So how come you're keepin' things from me?
Pardon me, pardon me (ohh)
Pardon me
Pardon me, but you said you'd always talk to me
So how come you're keepin' things from me?
Pardon me
Pardon me
