<song artist="Naughty_Boy" title="Home">
Red dove ends the driveway
On the street where we met
I'd take the thousand memories
On the road we meet, 
So we never forget 
It's been a good year, would be a long day
Before we lay our heads down to rest
And if those tears come rolling down,
I'll pull you close to me
Tell you that we're back there again
Won't be a long time, time
Won't be a long time
Won't be a long time, time
Won't be a long time
Till we get back home
Till we get back home
Till we get back home
Till we get back home
It won't be long
Till we get back home
Till we get back home
We've had good times, it's been real love
And I know it's hard to move on!
But the place you're send in the things we're left
It's when we're together, we're home
Won't be a long time, time
Won't be a long time
Won't be a long time, time
Won't be a long time
Till we get back home
Till we get back home
Till we get back home
Till we get back home
It won't be long
Till we get back home
Till we get back home
Won't be a long time, time
Won't be a long time
That won't be a long time
Ooooh oooh aaaah!
Till we get back home
Till we get back home
Won't be a long time, time
Won't be a long time
Won't be a long time, time
Won't be a long time
