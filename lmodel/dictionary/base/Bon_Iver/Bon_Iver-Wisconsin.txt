<song artist="Bon_Iver" title="Wisconsin">
You're out in the park and you're peeking
Piss pools in your seat
She's standing inside but you surely repeat
Oh God don't leave me here
I will freeze till you leave
Love is love's reprieve
Winter is coming and you're stacking
All your summer sheets
Now when the wind blows you cover your tooth
And our tool shed
Where you trade in your blues
Love is love's sad news
That was Wisconsin, that was yesterday
Now I have nothing that I can keep
'Cause every place I go I take another place with me
Love is love's mystique
You're up on the bar and you're shaking
With every grimy word
Who will you love? What's love when you've hurt?
The winter as your scene
The snow kissed the curb
Love is love's return
That was Wisconsin, that was yesterday
Now I have nothing that I can keep
'Cause every place I go I take another place with me
Love is love's critique
