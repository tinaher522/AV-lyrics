<song artist="Bon_Iver" title="Re:_Stacks">
This my excavation
And today is Kumran
Everything that happens is from now on
This is pouring rain, this is paralyzed
I keep throwing it down two-
Hundred at a time
It's hard to find it when you knew it
When your money's gone and you're drunk as hell
On your back with your racks and the stacks as your load
In the back and the racks of the stacks are your load
In the back with your racks and you're un-stacking your load
Well I've been twisting to the sun
I needed to replace
The fountain in the front yard is rusted out
All my love was down in a frozen ground
There's a black crow sitting across from me;
His wiry legs are crossed
And he's dangling my keys, he even fakes a toss
Whatever could it be that has brought me to this loss?
On your back with your racks as the stacks as your load
In the back and the racks and the stacks of your load
In the back with your racks and you're un-stacking your load
This is not the sound of a new man
Or a crispy realization
It's the sound of the unlocking and the lift away
Your love will be safe with me
