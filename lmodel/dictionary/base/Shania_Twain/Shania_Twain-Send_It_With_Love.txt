<song artist="Shania_Twain" title="Send_It_With_Love">
Whenever I think of you
It seems so unfair
That I have to close my eyes
To see you there
I know I'm makin it now 
But its tough
I can't begin to tell you enough
The pain is too much 
And I give my heart in a prayer
Send it with love
And you just say the words 
And I'll be there
Send it with love
Send it with love
I've come to realize that 
I'm on my own
So whenever I'm scared inside
I dream that your home
Hard to say 
How everything happened so fast
So many questions to ask
ohh
And I give my heart in a prayer
Sent it with love
You just say the word 
And I'll be there
Send it with love
Send it with love
Is it right or is it wrong
To want you here so much
I can never bring you back 
So I feel what I can't touch
I've come to realize that I'm on my own
And I give my heart in a prayer
Send it with love
You just say the word 
And I'll be there
Send it with love
Send it with love
And I give my heart in a prayer
Send it with love
You just say the word 
And I'll be there
Send it with love
Send it with love
