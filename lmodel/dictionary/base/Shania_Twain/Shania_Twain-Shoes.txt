Tell me about it
Men, have you ever tried to figure 'em out?
Huh, me too, but I ain't got no clue
How 'bout you?
Men are like shoes
Made to confuse
Yeah, there's so many of 'em
I don't know which ones to choose (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Ah, sing it to me
If you agree (yeah, yeah, yeah)
There's the kind made for running
The sneakers and the low down heels
The kind that'll keep you on your toes
And every girl knows how that feels (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Ouch, ah, sing it with me (yeah, yeah, yeah) 
Oh, you got your kickers and your ropers
Your everyday loafers, and some that you can never find
You got your slippers and your zippers
Your grabbers and your grippers
And man, don't ya hate that kind?
Some you wear in, some you wear out
Some you wanna leave behind
Sometimes you hate 'em
And sometimes you love 'em
I guess it all depends on which way you rub 'em
But a girl can never have too many of 'em 
It's amazing what a little polish'll do
Men are like shoes
Some make you feel ten feet tall
Some make you feel so small
And some y'wanna leave out in the hall
Or make you feel like kicking the wall (yeah, yeah, yeah) 
Ah, sing it with me, girls
Ooh (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Mmm 
You got your kickers and your ropers
Your everyday loafers, and some that you can never find
You got your slippers and your zippers
Your grabbers and your grippers
Man, don't ya hate that kind?
Some you wear in, and some you wear out
Some you wanna leave behind
Sometimes you hate 'em
And sometimes you love 'em
I guess it all depends on which way you rub 'em
But a girl can never have too many of 'em 
Some can polish up pretty good
Ah, men are like shoes

It's amazing what a little polish will do
Some clean up good, just like new
Some you can't afford, some are real cheap
Some are good for bumming around on the beach
(You got your kickers and your ropers)
(Your everyday loafers)
Yeah, some that you can never find
(You got your slippers and your zippers)
(Your grabbers and your grippers)
And man, don't ya hate that kind?
You got your kickers and your ropers
Your everyday loafers, and some that you can never find
You got your slippers and your zippers
Your grabbers and your grippers
Man, don't ya hate that kind?
Some you wear in, and some you wear out
Some you wanna leave behind
Sometimes you hate 'em
Sometimes you love 'em
I guess it all depends on which way you rub 'em
But a girl can never have too many of 'em 
I ain't got time for the flip-flop kind
Men are like shoes
