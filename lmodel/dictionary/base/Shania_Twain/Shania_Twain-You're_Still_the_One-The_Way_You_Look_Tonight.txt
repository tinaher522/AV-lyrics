<song artist="Shania_Twain" title="You're_Still_the_One-The_Way_You_Look_Tonight">
(When I first saw you, I saw love
And the first time you touched me, I felt love
And after all this time, you're still the one I love)
Looks like we made it
Look how far we've come my baby
We might've took the long way
We knew we'd get there some day
They said "I'll bet they'll never make it"
But just look at us holding on
We're still together, still going strong
(You're still the one)
You're still the one I run to
The one that I belong to
You're still the one I want for life
(You're still the one)
You're still the one that I love
The only one I dream of
You're still the one I kiss goodnight
Ain't nothing better
We beat the odds together
I'm glad we didn't listen
Look at what we would be missing
They said "I'll bet they'll never make it"
But just look at us holding on
We're still together, still going strong
(You're still the one)
You're still the one I run to
The one that I belong to
You're still the one I want for life
(You're still the one)
You're still the one that I love
The only one I dream of
You're still the one I kiss goodnight
You're still the one
There was a time
I was everything and nothing all in one
When you found me
I was feeling like a cloud across the sun
I need to tell you
How you light up every second of the day
But in the moonlight
You just shine like a beacon on the bay
And I can't explain
But it's something about the way you look tonight
Takes my breath away
It's that feeling I get about you, deep inside
And I can't describe
But it's something about the way you look tonight
Takes my breath away
The way you look tonight
With a smile
You pull the deepest secrets from my heart
In all honesty
I'm speechless and I don't know where to start
