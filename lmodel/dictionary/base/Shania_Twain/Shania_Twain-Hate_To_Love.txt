<song artist="Shania_Twain" title="Hate_To_Love">
Midnight sky shining on my face
I feel the waves embracing me
I'm here to find some peace of mind
Time and tide it waits for me
It waits for me, yeah
So here I am again somewhere in between
(Hate to Love)
Trying to find reality in a dream
(Hate to love)
I'm afraid to say I need someone like you
(Hate to love)
oooooohhhhhuuohoh hate to love
Faded photograph
A picture perfect love
Locked inside this frame of mine
Forgiving truth
Is trust betrayed
If time heals all that left me behind
It left me behind
So here I am again somewhere in between
(Hate to Love)
Trying to find reality in a dream
(Hate to love)
I'm afraid to say I need someone like you
(Hate to love)
oooooohhhhhuuohoh hate to love
Loneliness and innocence
With you invades my heart
I've learned to hate the truth of love
It's tearing me apart
So here I am again somewhere in between
(Hate to Love)
Trying to find reality in a dream
(Hate to love)
I'm afraid to say I need someone like you
(Hate to love)
oooooohhhhhuuohoh hate to love
