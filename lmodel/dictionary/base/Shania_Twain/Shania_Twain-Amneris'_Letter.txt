<song artist="Shania_Twain" title="Amneris'_Letter">
I'm sorry for everything I've said
And for anything I forgot to say too
When things get so complicated
I stumble, at best muddle through
I wish that our lives could be so simple
I don't want the world, only you
Oh, I wish I could tell you this face to face
But there's never the time, never the place
And this letter will have to do
I love you
