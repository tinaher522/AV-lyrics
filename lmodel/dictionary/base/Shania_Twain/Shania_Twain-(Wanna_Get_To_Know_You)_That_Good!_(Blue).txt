<song artist="Shania_Twain" title="(Wanna_Get_To_Know_You)_That_Good!_(Blue)">
I'll be there when you're sleeping
And every hour you're awake
I want to hear your secrets,
Want to share your worries
Want to go the deepest,
I don't want to hurry
I want to take a lifetime to
Memorize your face
Want to hold you closer, kiss you longer
Want to hear your heartbeat,
Stronger and stronger
Want to know you all over
Till I know you be heart
Got to know you with all that I got
[Chorus]
I want to know you that good!
Like no one knows you
Going to reach way down deep in your mind
I want to get to know you,
Want to get to know you
Want to get to know you that good
Going to know you right through
You know I want to
So badly it hurts all the time
I want to get to know you,
Want to get to know you
Want to get to know you that good
Yeah, I want to know you that good
Every feel of your fingers
Every curl in your hair
Don't want to miss a minute,
Want to be right in it
Do everything you're doing,
Go everywhere you're going
Want to know you all over
Till I know you by heart
Got to know you with all that I got
[Chorus]
I want to know you that good
Want to know your emotions,
Want to taste every tear
Want to hear you breathing,
Feel what your feeling
I want to get to know
Know you that good!
Like no one knows you
Going to reach way down deep in your mind
I want to get to know you,
Want to get to know
I want to get to know you,
Want to get to know
Want to get to know you
To know you
I want to know you by heart
I want to know you that good
