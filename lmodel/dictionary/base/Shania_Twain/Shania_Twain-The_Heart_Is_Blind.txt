<song artist="Shania_Twain" title="The_Heart_Is_Blind">
I hear the slamin' of the door
there you go again.
I can take it anymore
that's just the way it is. Ooh...
But then i listen' to my heart
and the anger fade.
I wanna hold you
never let you go away.
Bridge:
I feel a regain war inside,
about and between the heart and mind.
But love wins wwhen i close my eyes
Chorus:
The heart is blind,
It will not see.
When hope is gone,
the heart will still believe.
I see you go.
With tearful eyes.
But for the shape of love,
the heart is blind.
I know there's bein a lot of nights 
when we couldn't sleep.
The words are like a knive,
they cut so deep. Ooh..
But when i listen to my heart
It's deeper than the pain.
I really love you,
that's all that matters anyway.
Bridge
Chorus
I'll always love you.
And hard times will only
make us strong.
If we keep holdin' on.
Chorus and fade
