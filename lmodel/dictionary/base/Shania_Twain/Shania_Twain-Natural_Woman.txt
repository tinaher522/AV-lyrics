<song artist="Shania_Twain" title="Natural_Woman">
Lookin' out on the mornin' rain,
I used to feel so uninspired
And when I knew I had to face another day,
oh, it made me feel so tired
Before the day I met you,
life was so unkind
But your love was the key to my peace of mind
Cause you make me feel,
You make me feel
You make me feel,
like a natural woman
When my soul was in the lost and found,
you came along to claim it
And didn't know just what was wrong with me,
oh till your kiss helped me name it
Now I'm no longer doubtful,
of what I'm livin' for
Cause if I make you happy,
I don't need to do more
Oh baby what you've done to me,
you make me feel so good inside
Good inside, and I,
I just wanna be close to you
Because you make me feel so alive,
oh, what you've done to me
Close to you because you make me feel so alive
You make me feel,
You make me feel,
You make me feel
Like a natural woman, woman
You make me feel,
You make me feel,
You make me feel
Like a natural woman,
You make me feel
Oh baby what you do to me,
Can make me feel so good inside
I just wanna be,
I just wanna be,
Oh what you've done, Natural woman
