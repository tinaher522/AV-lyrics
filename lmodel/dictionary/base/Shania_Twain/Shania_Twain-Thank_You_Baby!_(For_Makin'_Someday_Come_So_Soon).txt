<song artist="Shania_Twain" title="Thank_You_Baby!_(For_Makin'_Someday_Come_So_Soon)">
Check it out--
Oh, thank you baby for
lovin' me like you do!
I didn't like datin'--
and trying to find someone
I gave up waitin'--for love to come along
There had to be someway--
I knew I'd find it someday
Chorus:
Yeah, thank you baby!
For makin' someday come so soon
Yeah, thank you baby!
For lovin' me the way you do
So many numbers--
so many guys to call
Is it any wonder--
I got nowhere at all
Oh, well it had to be someway 
(it had to be someway) 
I knew I'd find it someday
Repeat Chorus
Thank you baby (check it out)
Instrumental Solo
Oh,
Uh, uh, uh, yeah
There had to be someway--
I knew I'd find it someday
Repeat Chorus
(Thank you baby) Thank you baby!
(Thank you baby) For lovin'
me the way, me the way you do
Baby someway, someday, somewhere
Yeah, yeah
Oh, thank you baby! For lovin'
me like you do
Oh, thank you baby
