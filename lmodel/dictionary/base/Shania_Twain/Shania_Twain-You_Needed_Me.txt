<song artist="Shania_Twain" title="You_Needed_Me">
I cried a tear
You wiped it dry
I was confused
You cleared my mind
I sold my soul
You bought it back for me
And held me up
And gave me dignity
Somehow you needed me
You gave me strength
To stand alone again
To face the world
Out on my own again
You put me high
Upon a pedestal
So high that I could
Almost see eternity
You needed me, you needed me
And I can't believe it's you
I can't believe it's true
I needed you
And you were there
And I'll never leave
Why should I leave, I'd be a fool
'Cause I've finally found
Someone who really cares
You held my hand
When it was cold
When I was lost
You took me home
You gave me hope
When I was at the end
And turned my lies
Back into truth again
You even called me friend
You gave me strength
To stand alone again
To face the world
Out on my own again
You put me high
Upon a pedestal
So high that I could
Almost see eternity
You needed me, you needed me
You needed me, you needed me
