<song artist="Shania_Twain" title="Bite_My_Lip">
I gotta a 9-5 that seems like it never ends
I gotta touchy boss that wants me in his hands yeah
And no is a word that he doesn't understand
He says baby can you work with me til 9
I know he knows that I can use the overtime yeah
But I can tell he's gonna hand me another line
Gotta bite my lip 
Keep it in stride
Gotta bite my lip
Just let it ride
Gotta bite my lip
Watch what I say 
Gotta bite my lip
Just walk away
Yeah I'm walkin home
I gotta hot date tonight yeah
I got us chilled champaigne
And a dinner by candle light
He's gonna be here soon 
And everythings gonna be alright
I  get a call and guess who's on the other line
I can't make it tonight
Can we do it another time yeah
Oh what nerve 
I'd like to give him a piece of my mind
Gotta bite my lip 
Keep it in stride
Gotta bite my lip
And let it ride
Gotta bite my lip
Watch what i say
Gotta bite my lip 
And walk away
Gotta bite my lip
Keep it in stride
Gotta bite my lip 
And let it ride
Gotta bite my lip
Watch what I say
Gotta bite my lip
And walk away
Gotta bite my lip
Watch what I say 
Gotta bite my lip
And walk away
