You can choose the channel
when we're watchin' the T.V.
Oh, babe--it's okay
And you can pick the flavor
when we're orderin' ice cream
I don't mind--yeah, that's fine
I'd do--hoo--hoo--
anything for you--hoo--hoo
Ah, it's all right if you sleep with
your socks on--oh, babe! It's okay!
And you can hurt my head with
your favorite rock song
I don't mind--yeah, that's fine
For you--hoo--hoo--there's
nothin' that I wouldn't do--hoo--hoo
You can put a hole in my shoe
But in my car--I'll be the driver
In my car--I'm in control
In my car--I come alive and
In my car--I am the driver--
watch me now!
You can blame me when you run outta
razors--oh, babe--it's okay!
And I will run around when
you ask me for favors--
I don't mind--that's fine
For you--hoo--hoo--There's nothin'
that I wouldn't do--hoo--hoo
You can put a hole in my shoe
But in my car--I'll be the driver
In my car--I'm in control
In my car--I come alive and
In my car--I am the driver--
watch me now!
I don't mind if you think you're
the strong one, yeah
Oh, babe! It's okay!
And you can have your way, honey,
even when you're wrong
I don't mind! Yeah, that's fine!
For you--hoo--hoo--There's nothin'
that I wouldn't do--hoo--hoo
You can put a hole in my shoe
But in my car--I'll be the driver
In my car--I'm in control
In my car--I come alive and
In my car--I am the driver--
watch me now!
Not you--hoo--hoo, not you--hoo--
hoo, not you--hoo--hoo
Yeah, in my car I'll be the driver
