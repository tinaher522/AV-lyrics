<song artist="Shania_Twain" title="The_Rythm_Made_Me_Do_It">
I just can't sleep so I get in my car and I drive 
I'm on the 101 and I'm cruisin' by 105 
Got the radio cranked and the rhythm is comin' alive 
Got the wind in my face and I'm ready to take on the night 
Not a worry in sight the DJ is rockin' me wild 
Things are startin' to shake so hold on 'cause I ain't gonna break 
Red light in the rear view mirror 
(Well hey you pull it over here) 
He says miss just step away from the car 
(Hands on your head move and you're dead) 
But officer 
The rhythm made me do it 
The rhythm got me high 
The rhythm made me do it 
What can I say 
The rhythm made me do it 
He's walkin' real slow and I know he's checkin' me out 
Officer please can you tell me what this is about 
You're doin' 105 and I'm lucky that you're still alive 
He says baby get behind the wheel 
I wanna make your tyres squeal 
Hey baby like to make some noise 
Turn it on, turn it up 
[CHORUS]
Got the wind in our faces been drivin' all though the night 
Got the red lights on and the DJ is rockin' us right 
Things are startin' to shake so hold on 'cause we ain't gonna break 
[BRIDGE 2]
[CHORUS (repeat and fade)]
