<song artist="Shania_Twain" title="It's_Alright">
Nothing's better than 
Spending time together
Hangin' 'round
Wish it was forever
Love and sunny weather
Shinnin' down
Ooh you're my lover 
There's no other yeah
Friends like me and you 
Can share a little lovin' too
And it's alright
We're gettin' it together every night
Makin' every minute very right
Lovin' everything we feel yeah
And it's so good
Doin' all the things we never could
Even if we're not sure that we should
Together it's you and me yeah
Buildin' sandcastles
Bein' little rascals
Havin' fun
Playin' on the beach 
Just stayin' outta reach
Of everyone
Ooh let's forever 
Stay together yeah
Let's keep what we got 
Forgettin' what we ought to do
And it's alright
We're gettin' it together every night
Makin' every minute very right
Lovin' everything we feel yeah
And it's so good
Doin' all the things we never could
Even if we're not sure that we should
Together it's you and me yeah
And it's so nice
We're gettin' it together every night
Makin' every minute very right
Lovin' everything we feel yeah
And it's so good
We're doin' all the things we never could
Even if we're not sure that we should
Together it's you and me yeah
And it's alright
We're gettin' it together every night
Makin' every minute very right
Lovin' everything we feel yeah
And it's so good
Doin' all the things we never could
Even if we're not sure that we should
Together it's you and me yeah
