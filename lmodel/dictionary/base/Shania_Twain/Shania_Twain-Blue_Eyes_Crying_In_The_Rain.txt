<song artist="Shania_Twain" title="Blue_Eyes_Crying_In_The_Rain">
In twilight glow I see
Blue eyes cryin' in rain
When we kissed goodbye and parted
I knew we'd never meet again
Love is like a dyin' ember
And only memories remain
And through the ages I'll remember
Blue eyes cryin' in rain
Some day when we meet up yonder
We'll stroll hand in hand again
In a land that knows no partin'
Blue eyes cryin' in rain
