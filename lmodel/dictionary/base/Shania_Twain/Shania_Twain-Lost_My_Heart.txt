<song artist="Shania_Twain" title="Lost_My_Heart">
Kiss me all over
Is all I can say
I've waited a lifetime
To feel this way
You leave me breathless
And out of my mind
I'm just so helpless
So baby be kind
I lost my heart when I found you
Yeah and it hurt so good to lose
I lost my heart when I found you
I lost my heart to you
You touch me in places
Deep in my heart
Imagination runs wild in the dark
Babe I surrender
Only to you
I can't remember
How it feels to be blue
I lost my heart when I found you
Yeah and it hurt so good to lose
I lost my heart when I found you
I lost my heart to you
You leave me breathless
And out of my mind
I'm just so helpless
So baby be kind
I lost my heart when I found you
yeah and it hurt so good to lose
I lost my heart when I found you
I lost my heart to you
