This friend of mine
He looks real good
He drives a fast car 
And lives in Hollywood
He treats me like his little sis
I gotta let him know I want more than this
His girlfriend Jane is a prissy brat
I don't know what he sees in that
Think she's cool in her short tight dress
Take away the glamour and she's just a mess
Have you ever think of me as more than just a friend
Ever? Will this dream never end?
I got L-U-V eyes lookin at you
I gotta B-I-G heart made for two
Would you feel the same if you only knew
I got L-U-V eyes lookin at you
I wanna close my eyes and take a deep breath
I wanna be strong but I'm scared to death
I wanna put your arms around my waist
And tell you that I love you right to your face
Have you ever think of me as more than just a friend
Ever? Will this dream never end?
I got L-U-V eyes lookin at you
I gotta B-I-G heart made for two
Would you feel the same if you only knew
I got L-U-V eyes lookin at you
This friend of mine
He looks real good
Guess who made it to Hollywood
No more Jane
I got her beat
Now I'm sittin pretty 
In the front seat
Have you ever looked at me and felt the feeling of forever 
With the two of us in love
I got L-U-V eyes lookin at you
I gotta B-I-G heart made for two
Would you feel the same if you only knew
I got L-U-V eyes lookin at you
I got L-U-V eyes lookin at you
I gotta B-I-G heart made for two
Would you feel the same if you only knew
I got L-U-V eyes lookin at you
I gotta B-I-G heart made for two
Would you feel the same if you only knew
I got L-U-V eyes lookin at you
