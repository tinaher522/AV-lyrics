<song artist="Shania_Twain" title="I'm_Holdin'_On_To_Love_(To_Save_My_Life)">
I don't need a shrink to tell me what to think
There ain't no missing link in my love life
It's alright, I ain't that uptight
I don't need a psychic 'cause I don't really like it
When someone tries to tell me just what my future holds
I already know
Your love keeps me alive
You're all I need to survive
I got you by my side
So I'm holdin' on-I'm feelin' strong-baby you're the one
For all my life!
Yeah I'm holdin' out-there ain't no doubt-I can't live without
You all my life!
I'm holdin' on to love to save my life
I don't need to get all caught up on the net 'cause I'm already set
Can't you understand-already got my man
No I don't need proof to show me the truth, not even Dr. Ruth
Is gonna tell me how I feel-I know our love is real
Your love keeps me alive
You're all I need to survive
I got you by my side
So I'm holdin' on-I'm feelin' strong-baby you're the one
For all my life!
Yeah I'm holdin' out-there ain't no doubt-I can't live without
You all my life!
I'm holdin' on to love to save my life
(I'm holdin' on to love to save my life)
Your love keeps me alive
You're all I need to survive
I got you by my side
So I'm holdin' on-I'm feelin' strong-baby you're the one
For all my life!
Yeah I'm holdin' out-there ain't no doubt-I can't live without
You all my life!
I'm holdin' on to love to save my life
Save me, save me, save me
Save my life
