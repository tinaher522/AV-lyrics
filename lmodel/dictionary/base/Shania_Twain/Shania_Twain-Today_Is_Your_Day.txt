<song artist="Shania_Twain" title="Today_Is_Your_Day">
You got what it takes, you can win
Today is your day to begin
Don't give up here, don't you quit!
The moment is now, this is it...
And know that you can, then you will
Get to the top of the hill
Part of the fun is the climb
You just gotta make up your mind
That today is your day
And nothing can stand in your way
Today is your day
Everything's going your way
Today... Today... Today... Today...
When somebody throws sticks and stones
All they can break are your bones
And life's gonna kick you around
Then kick you again when you're down
But today is your day
And nothing can stand in your way
Today is your day
Everything's going your way
Today... Today... Today... Today...
Life's gonna kick you,
It's gonna kick you around,
It's gonna kick you down...
Brush yourself off, no regrets
This is as good as it gets
Don't expect more or no less
Just go out and give it your best
Today is your day
And nothing can stand in your way
Today is your day
Everything's going your way
Today... Today...
I said today is your day
Today... Today... I said today...
Today... Today is your day...
