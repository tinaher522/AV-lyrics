<song artist="Shania_Twain" title="C'est_La_Vie">
It must be Monday! What a dumb day!
Can't drag my butt outta bed
Somebody stop me
I need another coffee
Like a hole in my head
When everyday begins this way
Gets you down and can drive you mad
The daily grind can freak your mind
But life isn't all that bad
Don't let it get to you
C'est la vie! That's life
and that's how it's gonna be
C'est la vie! Hold tight
it comes right eventually, Oh Oh
If only I could sleep in
And wake up on the weekend
Oh, what a dream that would be, yeah
But fat chance for that one
It ain't gonna happen
Better get back to reality
I could be a slob or keep my job
That is the choice we have
The daily grind can freak your mind
But life isn't all that bad
Don't let it get to you
C'est la vie! That's life
And that's how it's gonna be
C'est la vie! Hold tight
it comes right eventually, Oh Oh
Everybody's got to do it!
Everybody's got to earn their way
Uh, come on now
You gotta work your own way through it
Everybody's got their dues to pay
Yeah
The daily grind can freak your mind
But life isn't all that bad
Don't let it get to you
C'est la vie! That's life,
and that's how it's gonna be
C'est la vie! Hold tight
it comes right eventually, Oh Oh
Yeah, yeah
C'est la vie! That's life
And that's how it's gonna be
Uh, come on now
C'est la vie! Hold tight
it comes right eventually, Oh Oh
C'est la vie
