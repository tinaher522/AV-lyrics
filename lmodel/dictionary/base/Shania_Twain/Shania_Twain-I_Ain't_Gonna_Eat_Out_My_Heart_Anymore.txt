<song artist="Shania_Twain" title="I_Ain't_Gonna_Eat_Out_My_Heart_Anymore">
I admit you got the biggest brown eyes and you know how to part your lips to tantalize
Sure babe you know you can get any girl you want, go ahead, do it, and don't say you don't, you know you do
Well baby, I ain't gonna eat out my heart anymore
Ain't gonna eat out my heart anymore
Ain't gonna eat out my heart anymore
Just 'cause I ain't sayin' it you should be ashamed what I've been seein' babe
You better watch you step or you can bet you're gonna loose the best thing you ever had
Well baby, I ain't gonna eat out my heart anymore
Ain't gonna eat out my heart anymore
Ain't gonna eat out my heart anymore
I love you, I love you
I do babe
But you ain't gonna cheat on me
I need you, I need you
I do babe
Choose, is it her or me
Well baby, I ain't gonna eat out my heart anymore
Ain't gonna eat out my heart anymore
Ain't gonna eat out my heart anymore
I love you, I love you
I do babe
But you ain't gonna cheat on me
I need you, I need you
I do babe
Choose, is it her or me
Well baby, I ain't gonna eat out my heart anymore
Ain't gonna eat out my heart anymore
Ain't gonna eat out my heart anymore
