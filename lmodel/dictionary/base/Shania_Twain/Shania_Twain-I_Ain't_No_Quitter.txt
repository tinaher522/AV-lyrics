<song artist="Shania_Twain" title="I_Ain't_No_Quitter">
He drinks, he smokes, 
he'll cuss, he swears he tells bad jokes
And he ropes, and he rides, 
he lives life fast and loves to fight
He's a BOOZER,A LOSER 
he calls me up when he's had too much
He's a schemer, a dreamer
But I tell him to change his ways,
but he just turns, to me and says,
I (I) ain't (ain't) no quitter
Whooooaahh!!
I ain't givin up on him just yet,
cause I'm as stubborn as a girl can get
No he won't quit, but you can bet,
sticking to it  I (I) ain't (ain't),
I ain't no quitter
Well he chews, and he spits,
well he flirts too much and he loves blonde chicks
And he struts, and he strolls,
he looks so cool and yep he knows!
He's a beauty, a cutie,
his body rocks and the girls they flock
He's afflicted, addicted
I tell him to change his ways,
but he just turns to me and says,
I (I) ain't (ain't) no quitter
Whooooaahh!!
No, I ain't givin up on him just yet,
hmm cause I'm as stubborn as a girl can get
No he won't quit, but you can bet
I'm sticking to it I (I) ain't (ain't),
I ain't no quitter
Wahoo!
No, I ain't givin up on him jus yet,
cause I'm as stubborn as a girl can get 
No he won't quit, but you can bet
I'm sticking to it I (I) ain't (ain't), 
I ain't no quitter 
Ooh, his body rocks and the girls they flock,
he's afflicted, addicted
I tell him to change his ways,
but he just turns to me and says,
I (I) ain't (ain't) no quitter
Whooooaahh!!
I aint giving up on him just yet
Cause I'm as stubborn as a girl can get
No, I ain't givin up on him just yet,
hmm cause I'm as stubborn as a girl can get
No he won't quit, but you can bet
sticking to it I (I) ain't (ain't),
I ain't no quitter
I (I) ain't (ain't),
I ain't no quitter
I (I) ain't (ain't),
I ain't no quitter
