<song artist="Frank_Ocean" title="Bad_Religion">
Taxi driver
Be my shrink for the hour
Leave the meter running
It's rush hour
So take the streets if you wanna
Just outrun the demons could you
He said, "Allah hu akbar."
I told him don't curse me
"Bo bo, you need prayer."
I guess it couldn't hurt me
If it brings me to my knees
It's a bad religion
Ooh, this unrequited love
To me it's nothing but a one man cult
And cyanide in my styrofoam cup
I could never make him love me
Never make him love me
Love me, love me, love me, love me
Love me, love me
Love me love me love me love
Taxi driver
I swear I've got three lives
Balanced on my head like steak knives
I can't tell you the truth about my disguise
I can't trust no one
And you say, "Allah hu akbar."
I told him don't curse me
"Bo bo, you need prayer."
I guessed it couldn't hurt me, yeah
If it brings me to my knees
It's a bad religion
Oh, unrequited love
To me it's nothing but a one man cult
And cyanide in my styrofoam cup
I could never make him love me
Never make him love me
No, no, oh
It's a it's a bad religion
To be in love with
Someone who could never love you
Only bad, only bad religion
Could have me feeling the way I do
