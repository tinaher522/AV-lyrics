<song artist="Frank_Ocean" title="Sweet_Life">
The best song wasn’t the single
But you weren’t either
Living in Ladera Heights
The black Beverly Hills
Domesticated paradise
Palm trees and pools
The water’s blue swallow the pill
Keeping it surreal
Whatever you like
Whatever feels good
Whatever takes you mountain high
Keeping it surreal
Not sugar free my TV ain’t HD that’s too real
Grape vine mango peaches and lime
A sweet life, a sweet life, sweet life
Sweet life, sweet life
A sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet life
A sweet life, a sweet life, sweety pie
You’ve had a landscaper and a housekeeper
Since you were born
The starshine always kept you warm
So why see the world when you got the beach
Don’t know why see the world when you got the beach
The sweet life
The best song wasn’t the single
But you couldn’t turn your radio down
Satellite need a receiver
Can’t seem to turn the signal fully off
Transmitting a wave
You’re catching that breeze
Till you’re dead in the grave
But you’re keeping it surreal
Whatever you like
Whatever feels good
Whatever takes your mountain high
Keeping it surreal
Not sugar free my TV ain’t HD that’s too real
Grape vines mango peaches and lime 
A sweet life, a sweet life, a sweet life, yeah
A sweet life, a sweet life, a sweet life
Live and die in the life
You’ve had a landscaper and a housekeeper
Since you were born, yeah
The starshine always kept you warm
So why see the world when you got the beach
Don’t know why see the world when you got the beach
And the water is exactly what I wanted
It’s everything I thought it'd be
But this neighborhood is getting trippier everyday
Neighborhood is going ape shit crazy
You’ve had a landscaper and a housekeeper
Since you were born
The starshine always kept you warm
So why see the world when you got the beach
Don’t know why see the world when you got the beach
Sweet life
You’ve had a landscaper and a housekeeper
Since you were born
The starshine always kept you warm
So why see the world
When you got the beach
Don’t know why see the world
When you got the beach
The sweet life
