<song artist="Frank_Ocean" title="Forrest_Gump">
I wanna see your pom poms from the stands
Come on, come on
My fingertips and my lips
They burn from the cigarettes
Forrest Gump
You run my mind boy
Running on my mind boy
Forrest Gump
I know you Forrest
I know you wouldn't hurt a beetle
But you're so buff and so strong
I'm nervous Forrest
Forrest Gump
My fingertips and my lips
They burn from the cigarettes
Forrest Gump
You run my mind boy
Running on my mind boy
Forrest Gump
I saw you game Forrest
I was screaming run 44
But you kept running past the end zone
Where'd you go, Forrest?
Forrest Gump
My fingertips and my lips
They burn from the cigarettes
Forrest Gump
You run my mind boy
Running on my mind boy
Forrest Gump
Forrest green
Forrest blues
I'm remembering you
This is love I know it's true
I won't forget you
It's for you Forrest
Forrest Gump
