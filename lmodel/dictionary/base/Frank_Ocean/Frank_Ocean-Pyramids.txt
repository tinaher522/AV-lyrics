<song artist="Frank_Ocean" title="Pyramids">
Oh, oh, oh, oh, set the cheetahs on the loose
Oh, oh, oh, oh, there's a thief out on the move
Oh, oh, oh, oh, underneath our legion's view
Oh, oh, oh, oh, they have taken Cleopatra, Cleopatra
Run, run, run, come back for my glory (Cleopatra, Cleopatra)
Bring her back to me (Cleopatra, Cleopatra)
Run run run, the crown of our pharaoh (Cleopatra, Cleopatra)
The throne of our queen is empty (Cleopatra, Cleopatra)
And we'll run to the future, shining like diamonds
In a rocky world, rocky-rocky world
Our skin like bronze and our hair like cashmere
As we march to rhythm on the palace floor
Chandeliers inside the pyramids tremble from the force
Cymbals crash inside the pyramids, voices fill up the halls
Oh, oh, oh, oh, set the cheetahs on the loose
Aye, aye, aye, there's a thief out on the move
Oh, oh, oh, oh, underneath our legion's view
Aye, aye, they have taken Cleopatra, Cleopatra
The jewel of Africa, jewel
What good is a jewel that ain't still precious?
How could you run off on me? How could you run off on us?
You feel like God inside that gold
I found you laying down with Samson and his full head of hair
Found my black queen Cleopatra, bad dreams, Cleopatra
Oh, oh, remove her, send the cheetahs to the tomb
Oh, oh, our war is over, our queen has met her doom
Oh, no more, she lives no more, serpent in her room
Oh, no more, it has killed Cleopatra, Cleopatra
Big sun coming strong through the motel blinds
Wake up to your girl, for now let's call her Cleopatra, Cleopatra
I watch you fix your hair then put your panties on in the mirror, Cleopatra
Then your lipstick, Cleopatra, then your six inch heels, catch her
She's headed to the pyramid, she's working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid, working at the pyramid tonight
Yeah, working at the pyramid, ooh uh, working at the pyramid tonight, yeah
Working at the pyramid, uh, working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid, working at the pyramid tonight
Pimpin' in my convos
Bubbles in my champagne, let it be some jazz playing
Top floor motel suite, twisting my cigars
Floor model TV with the VCR
Got rubies in my damn chain
Whip ain't go no gas tank but it still got wood grain
Got your girl working for me
Hit the strip and my bills paid that keep my bills paid
Hit the strip and my bills paid, keep a nigga bills paid
She's working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid, working at the pyramid tonight
Yeah, working at the pyramid, oh yeah, working at the pyramid tonight, yeah
Working at the pyramid, ooh, working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
You showed up after work, I'm bathing your body, touch you in places only I know
You're wet and you're warm just like our bathwater, can we make love before you go?
The way you say my name makes me feel like I'm that nigga but I'm still unemployed
You say it's big but you take it, ride cowgirl
But your love ain't free no more, baby
But your love ain't free no more, she's working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid, working at the pyramid tonight
Yeah, working at the pyramid, that's right, working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid, ooh, working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid, working at the pyramid tonight
