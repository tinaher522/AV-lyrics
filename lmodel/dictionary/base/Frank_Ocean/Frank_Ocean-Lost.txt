<song artist="Frank_Ocean" title="Lost">
Double D
Big full breasts on my baby
(Yo we going to Florida)
Triple weight
Couldn't weigh the love I've got for the girl
And I just wanna know
Why you ain't been going to work
Boss ain't working you like this
He can't take care of you like this
Now you're lost
Lost in the heat of it all
Girl, you know you're lost
Lost in the thrill of it all
Miami, Amsterdam, Tokyo, Spain, lost
Los Angeles, India, lost on a train, lost
Frank Ocean and Raoul Duke:
Got on my buttercream silk shirt
And it's Versace
(One of God's original prototype)
Hand me my triple weight
So I can weigh the work I got on your girl
(Too weird to live and too rare to die)
No, I don't really wish
I don't wish the titties would show
Nor have I ever
Have I ever let you get caught, oh?
Frank Ocean:
Lost, lost in the heat of it all
Girl, you know you're lost
Lost in the thrill of it all
Miami, Amsterdam, Tokyo, Spain, lost
Los Angeles, India, lost on a train, lost
She's at a stove
Can't believe I got her out here cooking dope (Cooking dope)
I promise she'll be
Whipping meals up for a family of her own someday
Nothing wrong
(Nothing wrong, ain't nothing wrong)
No, nothing wrong with a lie
Nothing wrong with another short plane ride
(Nothing wrong)
Through the sky (Up in the sky)
You and I (Just you and I)
Now you're lost
Lost in the heat of it all
Girl, you know you're lost
Lost in the thrill of it all
Miami, Amsterdam, Tokyo, Spain, lost
Los Angeles, India, lost on a train, lost
Love lost?
Love love
Love lost?
Love love
Love lost
Love love
Love lost
Faith is the substance
Then the other channel on the
