<song artist="Frank_Ocean" title="Pink_Matter">
And the peaches and the mangos that you could sell for me
What do you think my brain is made for?
Is it just a container for the mind?
This great grey matter
Sensei replied, "What is your woman?
Is she just a container for the child?"
That soft pink matter
Cotton candy Majin Buu
Close my eyes and fall into you, you, you
My God she's giving me pleasure
What if the sky and the stars are for show
And the aliens are watching live
From the purple matter?
Sensei went quiet then violent
And we sparred until we both grew tired
Nothing mattered
Cotton candy Majin Buu
Dim the lights and fall into you, you, you
My god giving me pleasure
Pleasure, pleasure, pleasure
Pleasure over matter
Andr√© 3000:
Since you been gone, I been having withdrawals
You were such a habit to call
I ain't myself at all had to tell myself nah
She better with some fella with a regular job
I didn't wanna get her involved
By dinner, Mr. Benjamin was sitting in awe
Hopped into my car, drove far
Far's too close and I remember, my memories no sharp
Butter knife, what a life, anyway
I'm building y'all a clock, stop, what am I Hemingway?
She had the kind of body that would probably intimidate
Any of 'em that were un-southern, not me cousin
If models are made for modeling
Thick girls are made for cuddlin'
Switch worlds and we can huddle then
Who needs another friend? I need to hold your hand
You'd need no other man, we'd flee to other lands
Grey matter
Blue used to be my favorite color
Now I ain't got no choice
Blue matter
You're good at being bad
You're bad at being good
For Heaven's sakes go to Hell
Nah knock on wood, hey
You're good at being bad
You're bad at being good
For Heaven's sakes go to Hell, knock on wood
For Heaven's sakes go to Hell
Knock, knock, knock, knock on wood
Well frankly when that ocean so motherfucking good
Make her swab the motherfucking wood
Make her walk the motherfucking plank
Make her rob a motherfucking bank
With no mask on and a rusty revolver
