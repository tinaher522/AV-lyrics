<song artist="Frank_Ocean" title="End-Golden_Girl">
Darker times
They're telling boulder heavy lies
Looks like all we've got is each other, the truth is obsolete
Remember when all I had was my mother
She didn't compromise
She could recognize voodoo
Our daughters and our sons are just candles in the sun
Voodoo
Don't let him see divide
Don't you let her see divide
Voodoo
New New and Frank Ocean:
You know (She's got the whole wide world in her juicy fruit)
There's somethin' about you (He's got the whole wide world in his pants)
I can't believe I'm even talking to you, tellin' you this right now (He wrapped the whole wide world in a wedding band)
Then put the whole wide world on her hands
You're special (She's got the whole wide world in her hands)
I wish you could see what I see (He's got the whole wide world in his hands)
Frank Ocean:
She's got the whole wide world in her hands
She's got the whole wide world in her hands
She peels an orange for us in the morning
She woke me up to give me half
I can hear the children soccer ballin'
Like wildcats running on the grass, hey
You're a girl on this island
I'm a boy from America
My flight leaves tonight, but I don't think I'm going backwards
I won't be going backwards
You're my golden girl
You're the one I've chosen girl
You're 24k
You make it bright when it's gray
You're my golden girl
The sun has been kind to you
You're 24k (Girl)
But the sky's never gray (Never gray)
Silent moments, meditative poses
You break my focus, you make me laugh
Two mopeds racing through the forest
Making dirt clouds on a path, on a path
I'm my best on this island
I'm a mess in America
My flight left last night, but I know I'm not going back home, yeah
I'm not going back home, no
You're my golden girl
You're the one I've chosen girl
You're 24k
You make it bright when it's gray
You're my golden girl
The sun has been kind to you
You're 24k (Girl)
But the sky's never gray (Never gray)
If we build a house in paradise, will we get to heaven still?
If we don't have to live through hell just to get to heaven
I'mma stay right here with you
Till the hurricane comes, till the tsunami comes, I've found my girl
You're my golden girl
You're the one I've chosen girl
You're 24k
You make it bright when it's gray
You're my golden girl
The sun has been kind to you
You're 24k (Girl)
But the sky's never gray (Never gray)
Tyler, The Creator:
Um, you're my G-O L-D E-N G-I R-L
And that's for the females that can't spell, but
Thanks for fucking with me
You turn my dark into light, you're like a bucket of bleach, you see
I want you to know that my negatives at home aren't working for my Kodak
So that means that I don't want to go back
Just know that I would like to stay here and hold that hand of yours
Girl I'm a wreck in America, your face is the best
'Cause it's the same color as the lace on my neck
And you're golden, uh, your eyes open, fuck it
Let's toast and listen to Michael Bolton
I free-fall off the hill again
Let's see where I land, I'm like Gilligan
Um, I trust you, Golden, for wed ring
I'm just hopin' that you don't turn my neck green
