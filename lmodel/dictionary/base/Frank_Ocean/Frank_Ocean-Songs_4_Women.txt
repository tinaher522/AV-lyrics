<song artist="Frank_Ocean" title="Songs_4_Women">
When I was younger I used to wonder like
If I was singing songs, just to sing the songs
Or if was singing cause that's what the bitches wanted
I couldn't play guitar like Van Halen
Had no secret chords like Saint David
But you still came around, ate your lunch with me
Used to park your car to try to bus with me
But I would say girl don't be dumb, I'm riding shotgun
We could go to my house after school after school (after school)
Cause my dad don't clock off 'til late (off 'til late, off 'til late)
We could kick it in the living room looking through my whole vinyl collection
And you could teach me how to slow dance or something
And I'mma give you chills harmonizing to Otis, Isley, Marvin
And everytime somebody asked me
If I sing songs to get at women, I say yeah
They say no fair no fair that's cheating
I say shit, oh well, oh well
And everytime a nigga asks me
If I sing songs to get at women, I say yeah
They say no fair, no fair that's cheating
I say boy don't judge cause hell if you were me
You'd be singin' to her, like lah dah dah dah
Now I'm in the lab, always working late
Always sleeping past, the breakfast she makes
She used to stop by, come and holla at me
Put her purse down and try to battle rap me
She don't do that no more (no more, no more)
Don't even listen to the songs I record
But she be banging that Drake in my car
I'm so far gone, she stay blasting Trey and his songs
All damn day long, it's like she never heard of me (heard of me)
Now everytime somebody asks me
If I sing songs to get at women
I say naw they say okay I don't believe it
I say nope I swear I never do it
And everytime a nigga asks me
If I sing songs to get at women, I say naw
They say who do you think you're kidding
I know you, you stole my girlfriend
Now see I just don't play fair, but it's fair enough
Cause yo girl broke my heart in half
Now I'm singing 'bout heartbreak
And now I'm singing 'bout love lost
