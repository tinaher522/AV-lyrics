<song artist="Frank_Ocean" title="Sierra_Leone">
We're spending too much time alone
We're spending too much time alone
And I just ran out of Trojans
Horses gallop to her throne
We're behaving like teenagers
Yes, wWe're behaving like teenagers
Making less than minimum wage
Still inside our parents' homes
No, I don't live in Denver
I don't live in Denver
I grew up in Sierra Leone
And her pink skies will keep me warm
Sierra Leone
Sierra Leone
Tid bits of intuition that I been gettin
Abandon mission abandon mission
You must be kidding
This shit feelin different
Shit feelin too good
To me glistenin
Shimmerin underneath the sunlight
The sunlight
And a new day
Will bring about the dawn
And a new day
Will bring another crying babe into the world
(Girl now)
Our daughters reaching for your nipple
'Cause it's time for her to eat
Tonight I'll lay her in the cradle
If it's time for go to sleep
I'll sing a Lennon lullaby
She can have a pretty dream
Baby girl if you knew what I know
Knew what I know
