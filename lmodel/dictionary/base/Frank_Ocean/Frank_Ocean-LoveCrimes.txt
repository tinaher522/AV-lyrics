<song artist="Frank_Ocean" title="LoveCrimes">
Talk to me and I better not hear a word
Do me baby, I better not feel it girl
Baby, I still got one bullet left in my nine
Finna do a lovecrime, lovecrime, finna do a lovecrime
Murder, murder, murder she wrote
Lovecrimes, lovecrimes
You write me love letters with your father's pen
If he knew the freaky, freaky things that you write with it
Is it really wrong that I want to be the baby daddy?
Is that a lovecrime, lovecrime? Tell me it's a lovecrime
Murder, murder, murder she wrote
Lovecrimes, lovecrimes
In the getaway car
You know I love it when the ride is smooth
If we ever get caught
It'd be a long vacation for two
Murder, murder, murder she wrote
Lovecrimes, lovecrimes
