<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="Change_In_Louise">
Still taking pictures of people at rest,
smiling at men who are never impressed,
always working hard down on bended knee,
who else but me can see the change in Louise?
Ride Louise, ride (yeah) let me be your guide
I'll take you any place you wanna go, (yes I will)
Ride Louise, ride (yeah) let me be your guide
and I'll show you all the things you want to know (if I can)
Livng her life at a speed all her own,
talking to people where ever she goes,
always working hard she won't disagree,
who else but me can see the change in Louise?
Ride Louise, ride (yeah) let me be your guide
I'll take you any place you wanna go, (yes I will)
Ride Louise, ride (yeah) let me be your guide
and I'll show you all the things you want to know (if I can)
