<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="Wake_Up_Little_Susie">
Wake up, little Susie, wake up 
Wake up, little Susie, wake up
We've both been sound asleep, wake up, little Susie, and weep 
The movie's over, it's four o'clock, and we're in trouble deep 
Wake up little Susie 
Wake up little Susie, well 
What are we gonna tell your mama 
What are we gonna tell your pa 
What are we gonna tell our friends when they say 'ooh-la-la' 
Wake up little Susie 
Wake up little Susie, well 
I told your mama that you'd be in by ten 
Well Susie baby looks like we goofed again 
Wake up little Susie 
Wake up little Susie, we got to go home 
Wake up, little Susie, wake up 
Wake up, little Susie, wake up
The movie wasn't so hot, it didn't have much of a plot 
We fell asleep, our goose is cooked, our reputation is shot 
Wake up little Susie 
Wake up little Susie, well 
What are we gonna tell your mama 
What are we gonna tell your pa 
What are we gonna tell our friends when they say 'ooh-la-la' 
Wake up little Susie 
Wake up little Susie 
Wake up little Susie
