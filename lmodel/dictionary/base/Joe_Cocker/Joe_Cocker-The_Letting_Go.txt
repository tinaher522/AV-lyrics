<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="The_Letting_Go">
Driving home they were playing that song 
Took me back to where we belong 
Now and then I stumble but I think you'd agree 
Each day I'm learning to take care of me 
And there's the reasons why, I know 
But nobody tells you 'bout the letting go 
Maybe it's the rain we've been having recently 
There's something about the rain keeps reminding me 
But these days I'm sure you would be surprised 
I'm a different persion you'd hardly recognise 
And there's the reasons why I know 
But nobody tells you 'bout the letting go 
Take my fears away lift me high 
High above the sky 
I'm out here on a limb 
Like a bird that's forgotten how to fly 
Maybe it's the rain or should I blame the snow 
Maybe it's every tiny little thing that reminds me of you 
Maybe this hurt in my heart will take time to go 
But at least I know 
There's the reasons why, I know 
But nobody told me 'bout the letting go 
There's the reasons why I know 
But nobody tells you 'bout the letting go 
Forget the reasons, they don't soften the blow 
Nobody told me 'bout the letting go
