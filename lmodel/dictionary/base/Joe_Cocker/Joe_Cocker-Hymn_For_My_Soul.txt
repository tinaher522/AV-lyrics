<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="Hymn_For_My_Soul">
I saw myself today
I've smiled and looked away
Saddened by my visible life
Sorrow cut me like a knife
Nobody knows you without any doubt
Nobody wants to know you, when you're down and out
So sing a hymn for my soul
Stand by me as I grow
I'm just trying to climb up nine hills in seven short days
Sing a hymn for my soul
I saw myself today
Didn't like what I had to say
So right, I could only be wrong
Trouble is when I'm alone
No doubt, no self-control, not a reason to cry
I feel like empty rain, through an empty sky
So Sing a hymn for my soul
Stand by me as I grow
I'm just trying to climb up nine hills in seven short days
So sing a hymn for my soul
I saw myself today
I looked good, yes I had to say
Polished TV won't shine no more
Flyin' dragons surround my door
Even when I go crazy
To my own self I'll be true
Ain't nobody's business what I do
So sing a hymn for my soul
Stand by me as I grow
I'm just trying to climb up nine hills in seven short days
Sing a hymn for my soul
Tell me about it
Sing a hymn for my soul
Sing a hymn for my soul
Stand by me as I grow
Won't you stand by me
Little girl, you know it
Sing a hymn for my soul
One more
Sing a hymn for my soul
Stand by me as I grow
I'm just tryin' to climb up nine hills in seven short days
Sing a hymn for my soul
Let's go home
Sing a hymn for my soul
Sing a hymn for my soul
Stand by me as I grow
Won't you do that for me
Take me all the way home
Sing a hymn for my soul
Sing a hymn for my soul
Come on baby
Stand by me as I grow.
