<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="Unforgiven_2010">
I don't wanna be here, I don't wanna be here at all
Stuck in my head, trapped inside these walls
So much regret, so much pain
I'm drowning slowly in the mess that I've made
I don't wanna be here, I don't wanna be here at all
Can I let it go or I will it haunt my soul?
How did I get this way? God, I feel so afraid
Will I'll be a better man, when I'll learn to understand?
I can't keep on living unforgiven
Didn't wanna hurt you, didn't wanna hurt you at all
I took you so high just to let you fall
Can I pick up the pieces of our life?
Start it over, give me one more try
Didn't wanna hurt you, didn't wanna hurt you at all
Can I let it go or I will it haunt my soul?
How did I get this way? God, I feel so afraid
I'll be a better man, when I'll learn to understand
I can't keep on living unforgiven
I'm so desperate to live, I'm desperate to breathe
So much to give, so much I wanna be
Won't let my mistakes take you away from me
Can I let it go or I will it haunt my soul?
Can I let it go or I will it haunt my soul?
How did I get this way? God, I feel so afraid
Will I'll be a better man, when I'll learn to understand?
I can't keep on living unforgiven, can't keep on living unforgiven
I don't wanna be here, I don't wanna be here at all.
