<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="Wayward_Soul">
Strange days
Out on my own
I'm a wayward soul
Comin' home
Something so sweet
At the end of the road
yes I'm a wayward soul
Comin' home
Some people got money
Some people got fame
All I had was confusion
Calling out my name
Found a new direction (found another direction)
Don't have to be alone
Just a wayward soul comin' home
Been kicked around
Like you kick a stone
Life has shown me things I've never known
But there's something so sweet
At the end of the road
I'm just a wayward soul
Comin' home
Some people got money
Some people got fame
All I had was confusion
Calling out my name
Found a new direction (found another direction)
Don't have to be alone
Just a wayward soul comin' home.
