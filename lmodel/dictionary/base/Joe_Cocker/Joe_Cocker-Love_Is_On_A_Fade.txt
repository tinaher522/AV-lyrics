<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="Love_Is_On_A_Fade">
There was a time you said no one could shine like I can
Now if I were the sun guess I'd be sinking on your rising
'Cause that look in your eyes gives you away
Love is on a fade
When you met him your shadow started getting longer
You say you still want me but I can see you'll soon be gone, girl
Two silhouettes walking away
Love is on a fade
Love is on a fade
It's leavin', it's gone, it's slipped through
Love is on a fade
You're gonna leave me with just forgettin'
That your good love never came my way
Love is on a fade
But baby, that's okay
If you lied and tried to trick me
I don't need your kinda love anyway
I'll be out the door before you can say
Love is on a fade
Love is on a fade
It's leavin', it's gone, it's slippin'
You're gonna leave me with just forgettin'
That your good love never came my way
Love is on a fade
When you met him
Your shadow started getting longer
You say you still want me
But I can see you'll soon be gone, girl
Two silhouettes walking away
Love is on a fade
Say I'll be out the door before you can say
Love is on a fade
I can see that look in your eyes anyway
Love is on a fade
And it's fading on me, leavin' me girl
Don't leave me lonely, don't leave me at all
Don't leave me, leave me at all
Love is on a fade with me, leavin' me down
You're down and lonely, yeah, fading away.
