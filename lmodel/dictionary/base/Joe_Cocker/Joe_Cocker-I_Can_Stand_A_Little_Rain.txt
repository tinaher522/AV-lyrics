<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="I_Can_Stand_A_Little_Rain">
I can stand a little rain,
I can stand a little rain,
I can stand a little rain,
Ooh, I can stand a little pain,
But when the rain comes up through the floorboards,
I can stand a little rest!
I can stand a little sorrow,
I can stand it until tomorrow,
I can stand a little sighin',
Oh, just another taste of lyin'!
Oh, I can stand a little love,
I feel I can stand a little love,
And when I'm on my bicycle ride,
I can stand another test.
And I mean it, mean it for ever!
And I can make it, make it,
I said make it somethin' more, oooh-ooh!
Made it before,
Yeah, I'm gonna make it some more!
