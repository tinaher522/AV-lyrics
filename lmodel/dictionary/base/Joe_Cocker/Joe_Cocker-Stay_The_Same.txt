<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="Stay_The_Same">
This life is upside down
We're trying to figure it all out
We're so close but feel so far
Wishing we weren't quit who we are
And we say
Some other love, some other face
Some other time, some other place
Some other path, some other way
Maybe the more we're trying to change
Maybe the more we'll stay the same
Maybe the more we're trying to change
Maybe the more we'll stay the same
We stay the same
Our hearts are warm and free
We're trying to find the love we've created
But deep inside we rearrange
Trying to fill that lonely space
And we say
Some other love, some other face
Some other time, some other place
Some other path, some other way
(Today)
Maybe the more we're trying to change
Maybe the more we'll stay the same
Maybe the more we're trying to change
Maybe the more we'll stay the same
I think we've seen what we want to see
I think we've needed what we really need
Maybe we are just who we are
We are
We are
Maybe the more we're trying to change
Maybe the more we'll stay the same
Maybe the more we're trying to change
Maybe the more we'll stay the same.
