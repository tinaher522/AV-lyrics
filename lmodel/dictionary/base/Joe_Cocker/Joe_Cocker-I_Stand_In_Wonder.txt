<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="I_Stand_In_Wonder">
Can't raise a dead man up
'Least I don't believe you can
Darling, you put the heart back in me
When I was such a lonely man
Now tell me why, why, why
I was waiting so long, yeah
Yeah, it's the power that you have
When I was weak, you made me strong
I stand, I stand in wonder of you
I stand, I stand in wonder of you
Darling, how you shared my bed
When I'm willing, you take my hand
When I'm troubled I rest my head
On your heart, I know you understand
Now, the world's not an easy place
Puts a man to the test
And when I come onto you
I know I'm deeply, how deeply I'm blessed
I stand, I stand in wonder of you
I stand, I stand in wonder of you
(I stand in wonder, I stand in wonder)
(I stand in wonder)
And I want you like
(I stand in wonder)
When I'm by your side
(I stand in wonder)
Where ever we go
(I stand in wonder)
Darling, we know
I stand, I stand in wonder of you
I stand, I stand in wonder of you
Oh, I stand, I stand in wonder of you
I stand in wonder, stand in wonder of you
(I stand in wonder)
I stand in
(I stand in wonder)
I stand in wonder of you
Yes, I stand in wonder.
