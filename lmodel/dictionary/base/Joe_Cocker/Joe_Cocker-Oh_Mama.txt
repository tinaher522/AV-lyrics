<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="Oh_Mama">
Oh mama
I don't want to feel this way
Oh, no not another day, please
Oh mama
Take me home
I don't want to be alone no more mama
I try to kick him off
But he hangs around
I try to stand up
But I fall back down
Rescue
A mean ol' man's
Got a hook on me
Oh mama
Oh mama
I try to kick him off
But he hangs around
I try to stand up
But I fall back down
Oh mama
It's so cold
I just don't know no more
Oh mama
Oh mama
