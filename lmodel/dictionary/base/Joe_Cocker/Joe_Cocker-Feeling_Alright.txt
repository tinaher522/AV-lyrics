<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="Feeling_Alright">
Seems I've got to have a... change of scene
Every night I have... the strangest dreams
Imprisoned by the way, yeah.. it could have been
Left here on my own or... so it seems
I've got to leave before I... start to scream
Won't someone lock the door and turn the key
Feeling alright
I'm not feeling too good myself
Yes, sir
Feeling alright
I'm not feeling that good myself
Boy you sure took me.. for one bad ride
And even now I sit... and I wonder why
That when I think of you I stop myself from crying
I just can't waste my time I must get by
I've got to stop believing... in all your lies
Hope there's too much to do before I die
Hey
Feeling alright
I'm not feeling too good myself
Oh no
Feeling alright
I'm not feeling that good little girl
INSTRUMENTAL
Don't you get too lost... in all I say
Hey--but at the time. you know, I really... felt that way
But that was then and now you know... its today
I can't get safe for I guess I'm here to stay
Till someone comes along and... take my place, yeah
With a different name, whoah.. and a different face
Feeling alright
I'm not feeling that good myself
Feeling alright
I'm not feeling that good myself
Feeling alright
I'm not feeling that good myself
Feeling alright
I'm not feeling good myself
Feeling alright
I'm not feeling too good myself
Feeling alright
I'm not feeling that good myself
