<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="So">
There's something 'bout the way, you don't know me at all
Silence is too strange, I'm still scared to fall
But till the early morning, with the sunshine we will lay
We will lay awake
So tell me your secrets, don't you hide
Tell me all your life and tell me why
Is there a chance that you're afraid?
As afraid as I
If you had one chance, would you get it right?
What if that one chance was right here, right now tonight?
Does it feel like it should at all?
Does it feel like there's something real here?
Oh babe, so tell me your secrets, don't you hide
Tell me all your life and tell me why
Is there a chance that you're afraid?
As afraid as I, oh so
Oh no, so tell me your secrets, don't you hide
Tell me all your life and tell me why
Is there a chance that you're afraid?
As afraid as I
Oh, no, don't you hide
Afraid, so afraid, you're afraid
Afraid as I, so, so.
