<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="What_Are_You_Doing_With_A_Fool_Like_Me">
Sometimes I watch you
As you're sleeping
And I can't believe
You're really here with me
I've got to pinch myself
To make sure that I'm not dreaming
Oh, something this good
How could it happen to me
I've never been the kind
That's lucky before
But my life changed when
You walked through my door
Now I'm more lucky than
I ever dreamed I would be
What are you doing with a fool like me
You could've found someone better
Who's a better one than me
Could've had anybody, I just don't see
What are you doing, what are you doing
With a fool like me
I know loving me ain't easy
Seems like I never say
The things I ought to say
It's like I'm never there
Girl, when you need me
Sometimes you turn to me
And I just turn away
I'm just a dreamer
With my head in the clouds
You should walk away
But still you stay around
I gave you rain
But rainbows all you see
What are you doing with a fool like me
You could've found someone better
Who's a better one than me
Could've had anybody, I just don't see
What are you doing, what are you doing
With a fool like me
Stand by me through
All the ups and downs
I'll never know
What are you doing with a fool like me
You could've found someone better
Who's a better one than me
Could've had anybody, I just don't see
What are you doing, what are you doing
With a fool like me
What are you doing with a fool like me
You could've had anybody
I just don't see, what are you doing
What are you doing with a fool like me
Yeah, yeah
A fool like me
(What are you doing)
What you doing, baby
(What are you doing)
With a fool like me
