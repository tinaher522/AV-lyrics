<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="Unforgiven">
As long as I am unforgiven
As far as I am pushed away
As much as life seems less for living
I still try
Let me say
For you
I'd do it all in a heartbeat
I know I can anytime
The time we'd find in a heartbeat
Is endless
As long as you're mine
If everyone would tell the truth
If I could only tell you why
If knowing me is any use to you
I'd still try
Let me say
For you
I'd do it all in a heartbeat
I know I can everytime
The time we'd find in a heartbeat
Is endless
As long as you're mine
For you
I'd do it all in a heartbeat
I know I can everytime
The time we'd find in a heartbeat
Is endless
As long as you're mine.
