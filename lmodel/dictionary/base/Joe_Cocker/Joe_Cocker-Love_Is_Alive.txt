<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="Love_Is_Alive">
Well, I think it's time to get ready
To realize just what I have found
I've been only half of what I am
It's all clear to me now
My heart is on fire, my soul's like a wheel that's turnin'
My love is alive, My love is alive
There's somethin' inside that's makin' me crazy
I'll try to keep it together
'Cause what I say may not happen the same way
Not to be for ever and ever
My heart is on fire, my soul's like a wheel that's turnin'
My love is alive, My love is alive
My love is alive
My love is alive
Is there a movie inside my mind
Reflectin' the love that you shine on me
Hold on now, to that feelin'
Let it flow, let it run, yeah
My heart is on fire, my soul's like a wheel that's turnin'
My love is alive, My love is alive
My love is alive
My love is alive
