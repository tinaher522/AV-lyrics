<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="I'm_Listening_Now">
There were times, I was sure
Everything was gonna be alright
The sun would shine, the world would turn
No matter how, I lived my life
Never needed anyone's advice
Well that was then
Today I’m thinking twice
I'm listening now
Trying to get it right
Tryin' to figure it out somehow
Yes I’m listening now
We all got our own plan
Our own way to ease the pain
We all find our own medicine
From blinding faith to novocaine
To stop the world
And filter out the noise
But sooner or later you've got to listen to that voice
I'm listening now
Trying to get it right 
Tryin' to figure it out somehow
Yes I’m listening now
Na na na 
Na na na 
Na na na
There were times, I was sure
Everything was gonna be alright
The sun would shine, the world would turn
No matter how, I lived my life
Loves the answer just like they always said
Come on baby, tell me something about love instead
I'm listening now
Trying to sort it out 
Tryin' to figure it out somehow
Yes I’m listening now
I'm listening now
Tryin' to get it right
Trying to figure it out somehow
Yes I’m listening now
Yes I’m listening now
Yes I’m listening now.
