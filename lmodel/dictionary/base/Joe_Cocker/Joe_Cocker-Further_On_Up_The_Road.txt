<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="Further_On_Up_The_Road">
Further on up the road, when you're all alone and blue
Further on up the road, when you're all alone and blue
You're gonna hurt someone, someone is gonna hurt you
You gotta reap just what you sow, that old saying is true
You gotta reap just what you sow, that old saying is true
Like you mistreat someone, someone is gonna mistreat you
And now you're laughing, pretty baby, but someday you're gonna cry
Now you're laughing, pretty baby, but someday you're gonna cry
Further on at the road, you'll find out I wasn't lying
You gotta reap just what you sow, that old saying is true
You gotta reap just what you sow, that old saying is true
Like you mistreat someone, someone is gonna mistreat you
And now you're laughing, pretty baby, but someday you're gonna cry
You're laughing, pretty baby, but someday you're gonna cry
Further on at the road, you'll find out I wasn't lying
Further on at the road, say when you're all alone and blue
Further on at the road, say when you're all alone and blue
You're gonna hurt someone, someone is gonna hurt you
Say when you're all alone and blue
Say when you're all alone and blue
You're gonna hurt someone, someone is gonna hurt you
