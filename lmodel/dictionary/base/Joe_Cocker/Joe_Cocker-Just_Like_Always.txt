<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="Just_Like_Always">
Every year when this day rolls around
I think of the night we both tore up the town
And I wonder if your're laughing with your eyes glowing
Making pretty conversation where the wine's flowing
And running and playing just like always
Every day at least one time
I picture your face in the back of my mind
Smiling at the ocean with your eyes shining
Your hair's a red river and it's all mine
You're a thousand days, just like always
Maybe someday I really will forget
Maybe start to live again a life without regret
Funny isn't it, but the man ain't laughing yet
Does love really last forever
Does the ocean miss the sunset every time
I pass your street, I look both ways
So incomplete
And I think that I might see you
Lord knows I won't
I wish that you would call me
But I know you won't
But I love you anyway
Just like always
Just like always
Just like always.
