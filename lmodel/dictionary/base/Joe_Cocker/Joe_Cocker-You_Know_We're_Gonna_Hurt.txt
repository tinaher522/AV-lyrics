<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="You_Know_We're_Gonna_Hurt">
Speak softly, sometimes words can land so hard
Come near me, we don't even have to talk
Practice of breaking heart
Can become something all around
And then look on your face
What you're saying ain't light to trace
You know it's gonna hurt
Get in line with the broken hearted, oh
(Oh)
You know it's going to hurt
That's the way the whole thing started, oh, oh
(Oh)
You know it's gonna hurt
And so we'll see, that's the pressures of our words
And we'll long through, we'll long through
All our faith and consolation
If added up the pleasures and pain
Can equal shares of things unsaid
Some things we'll have to be right about
While we're so cruel to ourselves
You know it's gonna hurt
Get in line with the broken hearted
(Oh)
You know it's going to hurt
That's the way the whole thing started, oh, oh
(Oh)
Tell this thing you lose, you love him baby
We just need a little time
Even if it takes forever to mend this heart
Mend this heart of yours and this heart of mine
Oh, you know it's gonna hurt
Get in a line with the broken hearted, oh
(Oh)
You know it's going to hurt
That's the way the whole thing started, oh
(Oh)
You know it's gonna hurt
(You know it's gonna hurt)
That's the way the whole thing started
(Oh)
(You know it's gonna hurt)
What becomes of the broken hearted
(Oh)
Yours and mine
(You know it's gonna hurt)
Just need a little time
(Oh)
And the healing baby
(You know it's gonna hurt)
You know it's going to hurt
(Oh)
And that's the way the whole thing started
(You know it's gonna hurt)
