<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="Great_Divide">
Nights are long
And the wind is howling down
Into the hollows
Somewhere deep inside
I can hear you calling out
Across the great divide
Right or wrong there's a feeling in my heart
I try to follow
But lately i just hide
And my dream of someday crawling out
To cross this great divide
Isolation
Heart like a drum
And the beating is wearing me down
Standing at the station
But the train never comes
Still I'm hanging on
Like some old ghost town
Miles to go but I see that one way out
Stars in the distance
Skies are open wide
Waiting for my soul to rise
Above this great divide
Desperation
Is a dangerous blade
In a reckless and trembling hand
Sweet salvation
Just a thin line away
I should cut and run
But I'll make my stand
Nights are long
But I'll close my eyes again
Until tomorrow
Slip the bonds and ride
Touch the face I long to see
Above this great divide
We'll be all We long to be
Beyound this great divide
