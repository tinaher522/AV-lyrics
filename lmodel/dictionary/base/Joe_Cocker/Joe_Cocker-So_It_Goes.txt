<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="So_It_Goes">
Just a girl without a name
I pass her by every day
She hangs around so no one knows
And so it goes
Down the street lives a man
An empty house and empty hands
What's inside no one knows
And so it goes
So it goes, no one knows
One more angel cries alone
People come and then they go
And no one knows
Is this really, really over us
I don't know, no one knows
When my searching comes to an end
Truth be told, no one knows
Is this really, really over us
I don't know, no one knows
And when my searching comes to an end
Truth be told, no one knows
Played on grass on the hill
One lone creature standing still
Gives a prayer but no one hears
And no one knows
And so it goes, no one knows
One more angel flying home
We all hope we're not alone
And no one knows
Just a girl without a name
I pass her by everyday.
