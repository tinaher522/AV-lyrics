<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="I_Can_Hear_The_River">
It's so cold on this balancing beam
I lose my breath each time I scream
All the time that it takes on this cliff
I simply wish that you were here
I must be in love with you
Be in love with you
Be in love with you
I must be in love with you
I think you're the reason
I can see the water
I don't feel so lonely
That I hear the river
On a night like tonight in the park
I sit alone out in the dark
On the days I'm waiting for you
It seems that
Water must break through
I must be in love with you
Yes be in love with you
I can hear the river
I can see the water
I must be in love with you
When I'm near the river
I see the bridges
I can feel the morning
I can almost touch you
When I'm near the river
Be in love with you
I can hear the river
Can see the water
I don't feel so lonely
When I'm near the river
I hear the river tide
Now that I feel the morning
I don't feel so lonely
When I'm near the river
Hear the tide
