<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="Bad_Bad_Sign">
There's a black cat crossing
And a moon that's full
I've been turning and tossing
'Cause I feel a fool
There's a broken mirror
On the bedroom wall
The phone keeps on ringing
But there's never a call
Right after we make love
You always leave
I'm not superstitious
But I do believe
It's a bad bad bad bad sign
Yes it is
It's a bad bad bad bad sign
There's a fortune teller
And a wise man too
But they couldn't tell me
Anything about you
Except the harder it's coming
It's gonna fall
And if that's an omen
I don't care at all
Then you say you love me
But you always got to go
I'm not superstitious
But I ought to know
It's a bad bad bad bad sign
Feeling alive
It's a bad bad bad bad sign
You had some restless night
I hear the wind outside
Sounds like making hard
It can't be step inside
You call out a name
And it ain't mine oh no no
There's a black cat crossing
And a moon that's full
I've been turning and tossing
'Cause I feel a fool
Then you say you love me
But you always got to go
I'm not superstitious darling
But I ought to know
It's a bad bad bad It's a bad bad bad bad sign
Do you never boo
It's a bad bad bad bad sign
You know that it is
It's a bad bad bad bad sign
I don't mean that I'm superstitious
It's a bad bad bad bad sign
Such a bad bad sign.
