<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="With_A_Little_Help_From_My_Friends">
What would you do if I sang out of tune?
Would you stand up and walk out on me?
Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song
I will try not to sing out of key
Ohh baby I get by
(By with a little help from my friends)
All I need is my buddies
(Try with a little help from my friends)

(High with a little help from my friends)
Who-ho-hoo-yeah
What do I do when my love is away?
(Does it worry for you to be alone?)

How do I feel at the end of the day?
(Are you sad because you're on your own?)
