<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="Living_Without_Your_Love">
Looks like you win
It's just like you called it from the start
I let you in
Now I can't get you out of my heart
Here I am
I'm dreamin' about you night and day
Wanting you
Needing you
Hoping you stay
All of my life
I thought I knew the taste of sweet
In my eye
My life was so complete
There you were
That same smile you wear tonight
Suddenly
This heart and me
Can't understand how
I've been living without your love
I Never know how I did it so long
Living without your love
All I know is I just can't go on
Living without your love
Darlin' I've had more than enough
Living without your love
'Till I found you
I never knew love could feel like this
Now that I do
I wanna make up for what I missed
Here we are
What I thought was just a dream
It's comin' true
Because of you
I know what love means
And I've been living without your love
Never know how I made it so long
Living without your love
All I know is I just can't go on
Living without your love
Darlin' I've had more than enough
Of living without your love
All the world couldn't see
But somehow you knew
Everything I ever needed
I'd find it with you
(I've been) I've been living without your love
I Never know how I made it so long
Living without your love
All I know is I just cant go on
Living without your love
Darlin' I've had more than enough
Of living without your love
