What set to wearing
Under that coat
I got a feeling
That I already know
It's a dying situation
That requires my optation
Gonna check at the toe
I'll be your doctor
I can see you shaking
Aching for a brand new start
I'll be your lover
Tell me were your hurting
Let me fix your broken hart
Why left to hurt him
Out in the cold
It's time how you starts learning
How a man takes a lady get take soul
It's a dying situation
That requires my optation
I will take you at the toe
I'll be your doctor, doctor!
I can see you shaking
Aching for a brand new start
I'll be your lover, doctor!
Tell me where your hurting
Let me fix your broken hart
I'll be your doctor, doctor!
This holy isn't working
You don't have to fall apart
I'll be your doctor, doctor!
Tell me where your hurting
Let me fix your broken hart
Hey!!
That's right
Tonight I swear I will got the remedy
I gonna kiss back to learn
I'll be your doctor, doctor!
I can see you shaking
Aching for a brand new start
I'll be your lover, lover!
Tell me where your hurting
Let me fix your broken hart!
Ahhh
I'll be your doctor, doctor!
This holy isn't working
You don't have to fall apart
I'll be your lover, lover!
Tell me where your hurting
Let me fix your broken hart!
