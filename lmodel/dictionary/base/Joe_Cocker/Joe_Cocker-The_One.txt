<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="The_One">
So a time has come and you lost your way
The light is gone and live is insane
A change is on the way
If your on the road or here at home
You've got to know, you got someone who loves you
All along the way
It's one for the other forever true
Keepin' the nights on the run
And lover to lover light on the move
Higher and higher finding that we are the one
We are the one
I don't even know anything
But how I feel the way that I do
I found me in you
And when time is up and the world is gone
I know one thing will carry on
I wont be there I'll be there with you
It's one for the other forever true
Keepin' the night on the run
And lover to lover light on the move
Higher and higher finding that we are the one
We are the one
We are the one
I've got to make it
I've got a song to write
I've got a lot to say
I've got someone who loves me
All along the way
It's one for the other forever true
Keepin' the night on the run
And lover to lover light on the move
Higher and higher finding that we are the one
We are the one
We are the one
We are the one.
