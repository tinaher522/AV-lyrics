<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="Across_From_Midnight">
It’s come down to just the two of us
Me and my shadow on the wall
Radio playin’ softly
Somewhere down the hall
And over in the next room
The hollow sound of the cigarette come
I’m sittin’ across from midnight
And morning ist a long way off
There’s a fire in the trashcan
In the alley below
A thousand others gather ’round
Sipping wine and talking low
We’re companions of the night time
We’ve got no place to go
Just sitting across from midnight
Time dragging by too slow
You can feel the night when you’re all alone
There’s comfort in the room
You keep hangin’ on
You wait … until … the dawn, oh yeah
The skeletons in the closet
March around like habitué
I guess it’s too much to ask for
I need some breathing room
And the tall city buildings
They cover up the moon
I’m sitting across from midnight
Bored and you can’t come to soon
The early morning hours
Bring out the darkness of your thoughts
When you sit across from midnight
Morning’s a long way off, so far away
Sitting across from midnight
It’s gettin’ dark
Sitting across from midnight
Me and the shadow on the wall
Sitting across from midnight
Morning’s such a long way off
You know I’m sitting across from midnight
sitting across from midnight
