<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="Naked_Without_You">
What have I done I've broke your heart 
Now there's no sun just cold and dark 
Without your smile I can't laugh 
Without you baby I'm just a half 
I didn't know what I had 
I didn't know I'd feel this sad 
But I feel
Naked without you 
I feel naked without you 
I feel naked without you 
What have I done I've broke a vow 
But I'm the one who's crying now 
Without your touch I can feel 
Without your forgiveness I can't heal 
No body else can take your place 
and if I don't see your angel face 
Girl I feel naked without you 
I'm still crazy about you 
I feel naked without you 
I hurt the one that really loved me 
Don't look at me I feel ugly 
Naked without you 
I'm so tired that I can't sleep 
I threw away a love so deep 
I feel naked without you 
I feel naked without you 
Naked without you 
I feel naked without you in my head
I feel naked without you in my bed 
Naked without you hey baby 
Naked without you and I feel 
Naked without you.
