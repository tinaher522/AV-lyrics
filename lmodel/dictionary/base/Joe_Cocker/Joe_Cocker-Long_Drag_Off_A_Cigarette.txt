<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="Long_Drag_Off_A_Cigarette">
She was sittin' there kinda' distant
Eyes half closed
She took a long drag off a cigarette
And let it real slow
I felt something click in between her and me
That's when she turned around and said
"Hey, Long time no see"
Looks like luck's been on your side
Knock on wood
I don't know what or who finally got through to you
'Coz I never could
Me, I keep walking back into the fire
Hey, is being confused some kind of sin?
But tonight I'm gonna turn around and walk right outa' here
Before I get back into trouble again
Man I feel kinda' distant
Layin' here with my eyes half closed
I'm gonna take a long drag off a cigarette
And let it out real slow
