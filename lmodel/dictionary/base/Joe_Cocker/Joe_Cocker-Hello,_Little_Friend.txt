Hello little friend
Oh it's good to see you back again
I'm very happy that you're bigger than me
In such important ways
You overlook the hung up and thoughtless things I say
My dear funny friend
You may be the only one that's ever been
Even when I use you, you see through me with real eyes
You keep marking time
Just waiting for a friendly chance to sight the blind
Oh darlin' I say you are a friend of mine
But if by some chance that might slip my mind
Little darlin' I hope that you will set me straight
Don't hesitate to sharpen my reality
The hour is late.
My dear little friend,
I'm sure you're the only one that's ever been.
And if I fall again I hope that I'll find
You standing close by
Just waiting for a friendly chance to right my mind.
