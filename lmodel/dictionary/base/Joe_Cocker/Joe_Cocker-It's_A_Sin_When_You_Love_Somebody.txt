<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="It's_A_Sin_When_You_Love_Somebody">
Now the Lord, he'll forgive you for cheating
And the Lord, he'll forgive you if you lie
Yes, he'll forgive and he'll help you to live
But he sure frowns down soundly on you and I.
It must be a sin when you love somebody
Damned if you don't, twice damned if you do
It must be a sin when you love somebody
As much as I'm lovin' you.
Now the Lord, he's known, and for his kindness
He's always willing to set a sinner free (set a sinner free)
He'll save your soul and he'll make you whole
But I don't see no angels comin' down
Shinin' their light on you and me.
It must be a sin when you love somebody
Damned if you don't, twice damned if you do
It must be a sin when you love somebody
As much as I'm lovin' you...
