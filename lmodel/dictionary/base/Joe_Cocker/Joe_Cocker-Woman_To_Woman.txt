<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="Woman_To_Woman">
Woman to woman (woman to woman)
Heartache to heartache (heartache to heartache)
Lover to lover (lover to lover)
Woman to woman (woman to woman)
Woman to woman
Everything I say everything that's happening
Seems to come your way
You don't care if it rains or shines
Long as you know what's in goin' down at the local rodeo
Woman to woman (woman to woman)
Heartache to heartache (heartache to heartache)
Lover to lover (lover to lover)
Woman to woman (woman to woman)
Lover to lover
Well, I'm brown as brown can be
Don't let it get on me
You talk about money, honey
And then you pray child
But I don't wanna be alone no more.
Woman to woman (woman to woman)
Heartache to heartache (heartache to heartache)
Lover to lover (lover to lover)
Woman to woman (woman to woman)
Heartache to heartache
Don't let it break so fast
Think about all you have
And let it last
I can't take no more teardrops from you
But that don't give you no right to shout
Woman to woman (woman to woman)
Heartache to heartache (heartache to heartache)
Lover to lover (lover to lover)
Woman to woman (woman to woman)
