<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="The_Letter">
Gimme a ticket for an aeroplane
Ain't got time to take a fast train
Lonely days are gone
I'm a-goin' home
My baby just a-wrote me a letter
I don't care how much money I gotta spend
Got to get back to my baby again
Lonely days are gone
I'm a-goin' home
My baby just a-wrote me a letter
Well, she wrote me a letter, said she couldn't live without me no more
Listen to me mister, don't you hear me ravin' for my baby once more?
Anyway, yeah
Gimme a ticket for an aeroplane
Ain't got time to take a fast train
Lonely days are gone
I'm a-goin' home
My baby just a-wrote me a letter
Well, she wrote me a letter, said she couldn't live without me no more
Listen mister, can't you see I got to get back to my baby once more?
Anyway, yeah
Gimme a ticket for an aeroplane
Ain't got time to take a fast train
Lonely days are gone
I'm a-goin' home
My baby just a-wrote me a letter
My baby just a-wrote me a letter
