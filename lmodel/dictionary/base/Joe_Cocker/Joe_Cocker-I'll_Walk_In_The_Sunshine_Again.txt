<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="I'll_Walk_In_The_Sunshine_Again">
Is that the best that you can do?
Do you think that I won't make it through?
You don't know where I come from
And you don't know what I'm made of
You won't haunt me anymore
I'll stand proud and I'll stand tall
There will come a day my friend
I'll walk in sunshine again
So come on bring on all your rain!! 
It's only water it won't stay
You turn to ashes on the ground
My sun burns through your black cloud
You won't haunt me anymore
I'll stand proud and I'll stand tall
There will come a day my friend 
I'll walk in sunshine again.
