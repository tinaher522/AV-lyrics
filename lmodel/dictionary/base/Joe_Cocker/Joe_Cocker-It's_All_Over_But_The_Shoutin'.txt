<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="It's_All_Over_But_The_Shoutin'">
Said it's all over but the shoutin' ya'll
It's all over but the shoutin' ya'll
After many sleepless nights alone
Believin' lies about where you've been gone
Well I hear the people whisper
Why's he never with her
And quickly hanging up their phone
Oh I put them all together
And it spelled sadness forever
And if I'm gonna change my fate
I'm gonna get out before it's too late
Said it's all over but the shoutin' ya'll
Well, well, well it's all over but the shoutin' ya'll
So pretend to be surprised
About the love that I've been denied
Once I thought that we could make it
But I couldn't fake it
So I'd rather let the whole thing ride
Oh and maybe in some time
I'll free your memory from my mind
Oh 'cause there's no turning back the clock
I've put you down boy
You've been counted out
And it's all over but the shoutin' ya'll
It's all over but the shoutin'
So if every thing's been said
I'll go prepare for the road ahead
Though at first I'll be regretting
Soon I'll start regretting
Till you're finally out of my head
Oh and one day, if I'm lucky
Someone's gonna come and love me oh
And fill my life with love each day
Till then all I have to say
That it's all, it's all over
Said it's all over
Said it's all over but the shoutin' ya'll
Well, well, well it's all over
