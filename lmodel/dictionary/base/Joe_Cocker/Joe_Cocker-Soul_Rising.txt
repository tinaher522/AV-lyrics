<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="Soul_Rising">
Yesterday, I was out in the rain 
Wondering when I’d see the sun again 
Lonely hearts, baby, I wrote the book 
Since she walked away without a second look 
Oh, but now I feel good 
Cos' you look at me 
The way a woman should 
I feel my soul rising to a new love 
No blues I can't rise above 
I feel my soul rising when I’m close to you 
When your with me girl 
There's nothing I can't do 
Yesterday I was falling apart 
Picking up pieces of my broken heart 
Yeah, But one touch of your healing hand
24 hours later I’m a whole new man 
Yeah, and I’m stronger now 
Cos' you make the world a better place some how 
I feel my soul rising to a new love 
No blues I can't rise above 
I feel my soul rising when I’m close to you 
When your with me girl 
There's nothing I can't do 
I got sunshine on a brand new day 
And the grey clouds have all drifted away
And there's nobody that I can't be 
If it's you and me.
