<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="Something_To_Say">
And so, what can I say, I thank you, dear
To share the few things you have
And oh, I'd like to say, I'm glad you're here
And hope your leaving is not sad
Soon I'll have to go an' get back on the road
Then I'll have no reason left at all
In times it's hard to say the things I feel
To wonder while I've known so long
Oh, you still remain so sure and real
But ev'rything is going wrong
But soon I'll have to go an' get back on the road
Then I'll have no reason left at all
Oh, have you somethin' to say, say it for me, please
Oh, have you somethin' to say, say it before I leave
Oh, have you somethin' to say, say it from your heart
Oh, have you somethin' to say, say it before I part
And so, what can I say, I thank you, dear
For sharing up the few things you have
And oh, I'd like to say, I'm glad you're here
And hope your leaving is not sad
Soon I'll have to go an' get back on the road
Then I'll have no reason left at all
Oh, have you somethin' to say, say it for me, please
Oh, have you somethin' to say, say it before I leave
Oh, have you somethin' to say, say it from your heart
Oh, have you somethin' to say, say it before I part ....
Oh let it roll, right from your heart now
Oh let it roll, right from your heart now
Have you got somethin' to say
Have you got somethin' to say
Have you got somethin' to say
Let it roll, yeah ....
