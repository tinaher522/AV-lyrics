<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="Darling_Be_Home_Soon">
Come
And talk of all the things we did today
Here
And laugh about our funny little way
While we have a few minutes to breathe
And I know that it's time you must leave
Oh, but darling be home soon (darling be home soon)
I couldn't bear to wait an extra minute if you dawdled
Hey now, darling be home soon (darling be home soon)
It's not just these few hours but I've been waiting since I toddled
For the great relief of having you to talk to (talk to, talk to)
And now
A quarter of my life is almost past
I think I've come to see myself at last
And I see that the time spent confused
Was the time that I spent without you
And I feel myself in bloom
Oh, but darling be home soon (darling be home soon)
I couldn't bear to wait an extra minute if you dawdled
My darling be home soon (darling be home soon)
It's not just these few hours but I've been waiting since you toddled
For the great relief of having you to talk to (talk to, talk to)
Well
Oh, but darling be home soon (darling be home soon)
I couldn't bear to wait an extra minute if you dawdled
Oh, but darling be home soon (darling be home soon)
It's not just these few hours but I've been waiting since you toddled
For the great relief of having you to talk to (talk to, talk to)
Go (go)
And beat your crazy head against the sky (beat your head against the sky)
Try
And see beyond the houses and your eyes
It's so great to shoot the moon
Oh, but darling be home soon (darling be home soon)
I couldn't bear to wait an extra minute if you dawdled
Oh, but darling be home soon (darling be home soon)
It's not just these few hours but I've been waiting since you toddled
For the great relief of having you to talk to (wanna talk to)
For the great relief of having you to talk to (someone to talk to)
For the great relief of having you to talk to (wanna talk to)
