<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="Look_What_You've_Done">
I don't need no one to make my bed
I don't need no one to rub my head
I don't need no one to do me wrong
I don't need no one to sing my song
When you left me it was for the last time
When you left me I was in a bad state of mind
I couldn't think, I couldn't drink, I couldn't eat
It's been four whole days, I haven't had no sleep
Baby, baby look what you done
Baby, baby look what you done
I don't need no one just keeping me down
I don't need nobody just making a sound
I don't need no one to make me feel bad
I don't need nobody just making me sad
You make me feel that there ain't no point in living
You make me feel there's no reason for forgiving
You make me feel like I'm mad with the world
I can't even think of calling another girl
Baby, baby look what you done
Baby, baby look what you done
You make me feel that there ain't no point in living
You make me feel there's no reason for forgiving
You make me feel like I'm mad with the world
I can't even think of calling another girl
Baby, baby look what you done
Baby, baby look what you done.
