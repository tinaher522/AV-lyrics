<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="I_(Who_Have_Nothing)">
I,I who have nothing
I,I who have no one
Adore you, and want you so.
I'm just a no one with nothing to give you,
But oh, 
I love you
He, he  buys you diamonds.
Bright, sparkling diamonds'
But believe me' dear when I say
He can give you the world, 
But he'll never love you the way,   
I love you
He can take you anywhere he wants
To fancy clubs and restaurants
But I can only watch you with
My nose pressed up against the window pane
I, I who have nothing
I, I who have no one
Must watch' you go dancing by
Wrapped in the arms of somebody else,when darling its I, 
Who'll love you
I'll love you
I love 
Yes I do
I love you
Oh yeh
I love you
Yes I do
