<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="Living_In_The_Promiseland">
Give us your tired and weak and we will make them strong 
Bring us your foreign songs and we will sing along 
Leave us your broken dreams we'll give them time to mend 
There's still a lot of love living in the promiseland 
Living in the promiseland our dreams are made of steel 
The prayer of every man is to know how freedom feels 
There is a winding road across the shifting sand 
And room for everyone living in the promiseland 
So they came from a distant isle nameless woman, faitheless child 
Like a bad dream until there was no room at all 
No place to run, and no place to fall 
Give us our daily bread we have no shoes to wear 
No place to call our home only this cross to bear 
We are the multitudes lend us a helping hand 
Is there no love anymore living in the promiseland 
Living in the promiseland our dreams are made of steel 
The prayer of every man is to know how freedom feels 
There is a winding road across the shifting sand 
And room for everyone living in the promiseland
