<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="You_Love_Me_Back">
We're gasoline and fire 
A blessing and a curse 
If you wrote us down on paper 
You'd swear we'd never work 
You'd swear we'd never work 
You're nothing like I dreamed 
Oh and everything I need 
 
In a crazy world 
Coming all apart 
You're my cover you're my lover you're my purple heart 
When there's no one left telling me the truth 
And I feel there's nothing real there to hold on to 
When I'm way off track 
When I hurt like that 
You love me back 
 
Like a magical oasis 
I could drink until I drowned 
You're the answer to a question when no answers can be found 
You turn it all around 
You take away my shame 
And love me through the pain 
 
In a crazy world 
Coming all apart 
You're my cover you're my lover you're my purple heart 
When there's no one left telling me the truth 
And I feel there's nothing real there to hold on to 
When I'm way off track 
When I hurt like that 
You love me back 
 
You love me back 
You make it all make sense 
You take this man 
When I don't think I can 
And make me all right again 
 
In a crazy world 
Coming all apart 
You're my cover you're my lover you're my purple heart 
When there's no one left telling me the truth 
And I feel there's nothing real there to hold on to 
When I'm way off track 
When I hurt like that 
You love me back.
