<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="Hold_On_(I_Feel_Our_Love_Is_Changing)">
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on
Turn out the light, sleep won't come
I think about what's going wrong
Lying so close, so alone
Please turn to me, I'm almost gone
Hold on
I feel our love is changing
Hold on
Please don't let me disappear
Hold on
There's time for rearranging
Hold on
I'm not me without you here
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on
Put out your hand, touch desire
Where there's a spark, could be a fire
Open your arms, let me see
If there is still love in you for me
Hold on
I feel our love is changing
Hold on
Please don't let me disappear
Hold on
There's time to rearrange things
Hold on
I'm not me without you here
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on
