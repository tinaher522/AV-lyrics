<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="Southern_Lady">
Southern Lady, are you listenin'Â ?
Come walk with me, I know there's a place we can hide
But until the moment when I pay the bill
My world is just you and mine
Well, the night lights are glowin'
In the mansion on the hill
And the neon lights are shinin' on my face
There's an old satin laces
The moon's sweet perfume
Just an all night memory
Of a [unverified]
Look at me, I'm the playboy on the hill
What a thrill, what a thrill, look at me, I'm the king
Till the mornin' light comes shinin'
You're mine, you're mine
Lady, Southern Lady
Please dream a dream for me
Lady, Southern Lady
Touch me and I will see
Touch me and I will see.
