<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="Feels_Like_Forever">
I saw you
That was all I had to see
Wanted you
Had to have you next to me
From that moment
I knew that you'd be all I'd ever need
And there's a place inside my heart
Nobody's touched before
And when I found you
I found all that I'd been searching for
You turned my world around
All I know
Is that it feels like forever
All I know
Yes I love the way it feels
All I see
Is how good we are together
And I never wanna see it slip away
I'll never let you go
Is all I know
Hold me
Love is here for us to make
Stay with me
Let's put our hearts in the hands of fate
Time will tell us
If what we've got was worth the wait
And there's a fire that's been burning deep inside of me
And I don't need nobody else
'Cause now you're here with me
You've turned my world around
All I know
That it feels like forever
All I know
Is I love the way it feels
All I see
Is how good we are together
And I never want to see it slip away
I'll never let you go
Is all I know
I might have never met you
At another time or place
Now I never could forget you
I could never walk away
That's all I know
'Cause there's a place inside my heart
Nobody's touched before
And when I found you
I found all that I'd been searching for
You've turned my world around
All I know
Is it feels like forever
All I know
Is I love the way it feels
All I see
is how good we are together
And I never want to see it slip away
I'll never let you go
All I know
Is it feels like forever
All I know
Is I love the way it feels
All I see
Is how good we are together
And I never want to see it slip away
I'll never let you go
It's all I know
Is it feels like forever
All I know
Is I love the way it feels
All I see
Is how good we are together
