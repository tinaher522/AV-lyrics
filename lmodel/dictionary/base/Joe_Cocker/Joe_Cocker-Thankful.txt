<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="Thankful">
I'm saying goodbye to the loneliness
Stumbling around in this emptiness
There ain't no heart when you're feeling so so low
I'm saying goodbye to what I know best
It's harder than failing 'cause I've passed that test
What's ahead nobody ever really knows
'cause all we got is just another chance
To find what we always had
And i'm thankful for breathing in the morning
I'm thankful you didn't walk right out of here
I gave you reason to up and leave
You found a way to stand by me
I'm thankful I've finally learnt to say goodbye
To everything that made me wanna give up on life
I never thought I'll hear me say
That i'm thankful so thankful
I'm saying "hello" to a lifelong wish
Loving the moment that I'm standing here
Breaking the cycle I'm being mindful
That's a choice I thought I'd never choose
I'm so glad I got another chance
To know just what I always had
And I'm thankful for breathing in the morning
I'm thankful you didn't walk right out of here
I gave you reason to up and leave
You found a way to stand by me
I'm thankful I've finally learnt to say goodbye
To everything that made me wanna give up on life
I never thought I'll hear me say
That i'm thankful oh so thankful
You always told me I should be
So thankful for breathing in the morning
I'm thankful you didn't walk out of here
I gave you reason to up and leave
But you found a way to stand by me
I'm thankful I've finally learnt to say goodbye
To everything that made me wanna give up on life
I never thought I'll hear me say
Stand by me
Yeah thankful for breathing in the morning
Oh god I'd didn't wake up to you
You found a way to still stand by me
I'm thankful I've finally learnt to say goodbye
I never thought I'll hear me say
That I'm thankful so so thankful yeah.
