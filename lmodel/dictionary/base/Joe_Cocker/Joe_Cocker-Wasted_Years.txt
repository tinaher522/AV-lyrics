<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="Wasted_Years">
I've spent a long time
Makin' my dream come true
I guess you could say
I've paid some dues
I can't take it with me
But neither can you
What am I gonna do
Oh Lord, what am I gonna do
I've spent a long time
Singin' the blues
And all of the sad songs that I knew
The music's still waitin'
To make its debut
What am I gonna do
Oh Lord, what am I gonna do
Wasted years, where are they comin' to
Precious time, where's it all goin'
All the melodies, peaceful harmony
I thought I could never lose
Oh Lord, I thought I could never lose
Music make you laugh
It'll make you cry
My music take you high
Music take you low and lets you go
Up to the sky so high, so high
Wasted years, where are the comin' to
Precious time, where's it all goin'
All the memories comin' back at me
I thought I could never lose
Oh Lord, what am I gonna do.
