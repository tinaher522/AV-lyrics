<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="What_Becomes_Of_The_Broken_Hearted">
As I walk this land of broken dreams 
I have visions of many things 
Happiness is just an illusion 
Filled with sadness and confusion 
What becomes of the broken hearted 
Who have love that's now departed 
I know I've got to find some kind of piece of mind 
Roots of love grow all around 
But for me they come tumbling down 
Every day heart aches grow a little stronger 
I can't stand this pain much longer 
Walk in shadows searching for light 
Cold and alone no comfort in sight 
Hoping and praying for someone to care 
Always moving but going no where 
What becomes of the broken hearted 
Who have love that's now departed 
I know I've got to find some kind of piece of mind 
I'm searching though I don't succeed 
But someones love leaves a growing need 
Always lost theres no place for beginning
All that's left is an unhappy ending 
What becomes of the broken hearted 
Who have love that's now departed 
I know I've got to find some kind of piece of mind
