There goes my baby
Movin' on down the line
Wonderin' where
Wonderin' where
Wonderin' where she is bound.
I broke her heart and made her cry.
Now I'm alone
Oh
So all alone. What can I do? What can I do?
There goes my baby
There goes my baby.
Movin' on down the line
Movin' on down the line.
Wonderin' where
Wonderin' where
Wonderin' where she is bound.
I wanna know
I wanna know:
Did she love me
Did she really love me?
Was she just playing me for a fool?
I wonder why she left me. -
Why did she leave me so all alone
So all alone?
There goes my baby
There goes my baby...
I'm gonna tell her that I need her
Oh
How I need her right by my side to be my guide.
I will know: where is my baby
Where is my baby-love?
I've been wonderin'
Wonderin' where she's bound and gone.
There goes my baby
There goes my baby...
She took my heart
Left me crying
Oh
So hard suffering.
There goes my baby
There goes my baby...
Where's she gone? Where's she gone?
There goes my baby
There goes my baby. ..
