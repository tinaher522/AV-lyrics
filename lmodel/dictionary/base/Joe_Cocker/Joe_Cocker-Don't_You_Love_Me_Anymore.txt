<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="Don't_You_Love_Me_Anymore">
I thought I'd see you smile
When I walked in the door
Thought those arms of yours would be open wide
The way they were before
Why do you look at me
Like I'm some stranger tonight?
Why do you pull away
When you used to hold me so tight?
Don't you love me anymore?
Have you learned to live your life without me?
Don't you love me anymore?
Anymore
When did the fire go out?
Where did the feeling go?
Did it slip away, when I wasn't there
And now I've come home
I thought you wanted me back
I was so sure you would ask me to stay
I thought you needed me still
Guess it didn't work out that away
Don't you love me anymore?
Have you learned to live your life without me?
Don't you love me anymore?
Darling
When did the fire go out?
Where did the feeling go?
Why do you pull away?
When you used to hold me so close baby
Don't you love me anymore?
Have you learned to live your life without me?
Don't you love me anymore?
Don't you love me anymore?
Have you learned to live your life without me?
Don't you love me anymore?
Don't you love me anymore?
Have you learned to live your life without me?
Don't you love me anymore?
Don't you love me anymore?
Have you learned to live your life without me?
Don't you love me anymore?
Don't you love me anymore?
Have you learned to live your life without me?
Don't you love me anymore?
Don't you love me anymore?
Have you learned to live your life without me?
