<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="Got_To_Use_My_Imagination">
I've really got to use
My imagination
D'ya think I've got a reason
To keep keeping up
I've got to make the best of
A bad situation
Ever since that day
Ever since that day
I woke up and found you gone
It happens all around me
Like a night of sin
Old friends call out to me
But I don't talk to anyone
Emptiness has found me
And it just won't let me go
I'll arrive at home living
Why I just don't know
I've really got to use
My imagination
D'ya think I've got a reason
To keep keeping up
I've got to make the best of
A bad situation
Ever since that day
Ever since that day
I woke up and found you gone
Staring down the empty
Don't do me no good
'Cause our misunderstanding
Is too well understood
Such a sad sad season
When a good love dies
Not a day goes by
When I don't realise
That I've really got to use
My imagination
D'ya think I've got a reason
Oh I should keep them on
I've got to use the best of
A bad situation
Ever since that day
Ever since that day
I woke up and found you gone
I've got to use my mind in love
I've really got to use my mind
Oh I've got about drinking this time
To keep on moving on
Oh loving
Ever since that day
Just need a little
A little bit of loving
And it's driving me crazy
I'm about to lose my mind
Yeah driving me wild
It's driving me crazy
Oh I've got no-one to love right now
I need your love
Can't live without it
'Cause
It's driving me over the edge and turn
Yeah yeah
