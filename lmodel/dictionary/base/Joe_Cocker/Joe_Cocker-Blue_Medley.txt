<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="Blue_Medley">
It brings a tear into my eyes 
When i begin to realize
I cried so much since you've been gone,
I guess I'll drown in my own tears.
I sit and cry tears like a child, 
My pouring tears are running wild.
If you don't think you'll be home soon,
I guess I'll drown in my own tears.
I know it's true into each life 
Some rain must pour,
I'm so blue without you 
It keeps rainin' more and more.
Why can't you come on home 
So i won't be all alone.
If you don't think you'll be home soon,
I guess I'll drown in my own tears,
I guess I'll drown in my own tears,
I guess I'll drown in my own tears,
I guess I'll drown in my own tears,
I guess I'll drown in my own tears,
I guess I'll drown in my own tears.
When something is wrong with my baby
Something is wrong with me
If I don't know, she's worried
Then I would feel that same misery
We've been through so much together
We've been as one and that's what makes it better
When something is wrong with my baby
Something is wrong with me
And what she, what she means to me now
You, you wouldn't understand
Some people would say that she's no good
Oh, she's my woman and you know I'm her man
If she's got a problem, I'd know
You'd know I've gotta help her solve it
When something is wrong with my baby
Something is wrong with me
When something is wrong with my baby
Something is wrong with me
When something is wrong with my baby
Something is wrong with me
I've Been Loving You Too Long
To stop now
You are tired and you want to be free
My love is growing stronger
As you become a habit to me 
Ooh. I've been loving you too long
I dont wanna stop now. oh
With you my life has been so wonderful
I can't stop now
You are tired and your love growing cold
My love is growing stronger
As our affair, affair grows old
Dont want to stop now. oh oh oh
I've Been Loving You a little too Long
I don't wanna stop now. oh oh
Don't make me stop now oh baby
I'm down on my knee
Please. don't make me stop now
I love you, I love you
I love you with all my heart
And I can't stop now
Please, please, please please no
Don't make me stop now. yeah oh
My heart and soul cryin'
