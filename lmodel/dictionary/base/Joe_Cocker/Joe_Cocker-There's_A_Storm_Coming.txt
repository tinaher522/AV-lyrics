<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="There's_A_Storm_Coming">
There's a storm coming
I can see it in her eyes
I can hear it in the way she says "everything's all right"
I can feel it in the air between us
And I think I know the reason why
There's a storm coming
Tonight
Here comes the rain
As she turns away from me
And I know there's nothing I can say
That she'll believe
There's a sound of rolling thunder
That'll be shaking everything in sight
There's a storm coming
Tonight
Clouds of anger, tears of rain
Just have to hold on, be strong
And hope that it doesn't blow us away
There's a storm coming
I can see it in her eyes
Of the broken promises
Yeah and the alibis
I can feel it in the air between us
And I think I know the reason why
There's a storm coming
There's a storm coming
There's a storm coming
Tonight
Here comes the rain
Bring on the rain
