<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="That's_All_I_Need_To_Know">
That's all I need to know
Maybe I have no grounds to feel jealous
But I'm just a guy
who's got to say it like it is
I must be sure of your love
on that I insist
Is there someone to whose heart you're around
just tell me now
Darlin' I will be gone
If he's just stealing from me
then that would be wrong
I'll stand my ground against any man
who will try to take you from my arms
If you know me at all
You know I don't let go
As long as you want me
That's all that I need to know
I've never been
what they call the fighting kind
But I'm a man
who defends what is mine
I've build my world around you
You are my life
I'll stand my ground against any man
who will try to take you from my arms
If you know me at all
You know I don't let go
As long as you want me
That's all that I need to know
If you know me at all
You know I don't let go
As long as you want me
That's all that I need to know
I don't break down
when I got my fear on the ground
I'm a peace loving man
But I'll take the blows
as long as you  want me
That's all that I need to know
That's all that I need to know
