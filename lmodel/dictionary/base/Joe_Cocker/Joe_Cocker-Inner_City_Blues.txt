<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="Inner_City_Blues">
Rockets, moon shots
Spend it on the have nots
Money, we make it
Before we see it, you take it
Makes me wanna holler
The way they do my life
Makes me wanna holler
The way they do my life
Listen baby, listen, this ain't livin'
I say no, oh no
Inflation no chance
To increase finance
Bills pile up sky high
Send that boy off to die
It makes me wanna holler
The way they do my life
Makes me wanna holler
The way they do my life
Won't you listen? Yeah
This ain't livin', oh no
Hang ups, let downs
Bad breaks, set backs
Natural fact is
That I can't pay my taxes
It makes me wanna holler
The way they do my life
It make me wanna holler
The way they do my life
Listen, please, listen
Is this livin'? I wanna know now
It make me wanna holler
The way they do my life
Make me wanna holler
The way they do my life
Won't you listen, listen?
Crime is increasing
Trigger happy policing
Panic keep spreading
God knows where we're heading
Make me wanna holler
The way they do my life
Make me wanna holler
The way they do my life
Just listen [Incomprehensible]
Is this livin'? I wanna know
Is this livin'? No, no
