<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="One_Word_(Peace)">
A man stands on the corner holding a sign
People yell at him as they drive by
I wonder what they read, made them so upset
I looked at the sign and all it said:
One word: Peace
In the Neighborhood, Peace
One Word: Peace
In my own backyard, Peace
A man in a foreign land kneels to pray
And wonders where the bombs will fall today
Our leaders tell me to fear him you see
Love conquers all is what I believe
One word: Peace
In the neighborhood, Peace
One word: Peace
In My Own backyard, Peace
Everybody's talking about it
Everybody's got to have their say
But to achieve it, there is only one way
And it starts with me and the word and the word is:
Peace
In the neighborhood
One word: Peace
In My Own backyard
Peace
One Word
One word: Peace
In the neighborhood, Peace
One word: Peace
In My Own backyard, Peace
