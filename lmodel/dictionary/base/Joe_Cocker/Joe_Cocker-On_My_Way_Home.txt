<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="On_My_Way_Home">
I'm on my way home 
That's where I belong 
Now the time has come, it's time we must go 
Cos now the tides have changed, we're moving on 
I'm on my way home 
Life must carry on 
So after all the pain and what we've been through 
To give up now would be oh so wrong 
Come what may, we're being counted on 
It's our day, this is our song 
(Do you know what's waiting there for you) 
nothing holds me here 
(If nothing's left there to go back to) 
Believe me anything is better than what we have now 
(turn around, turn around the hands of time) 
Can't be any worse, I've got time to spare 
(Do you think it's worth all the bother) 
someone has to do it 
(Nothing works out right anyhow) 
So all that we can do is try and try, try more everyday 
(turn around, turn around the hands of time) 
If there's a will, there'll be a way 
I'm on my way home 
There's no turning back 
After all that has been done and has been shed
It's our last chance, to keep on track 
I'm on my way home 
Though the road may be long 
There's no river we can't cross, or mountain we can't climb 
Because our faith is, much to strong 
(Do you know what's waiting there for you) 
Lord I don't know 
(Nothing's left there to go back to) 
Believe me anything is better than what we have now 
(Turn around, turn around the hands of time) 
Can't be any worse, I've got time to spare 
(Do you think it's worth all the bother) 
Someone has to do it 
(Nothing works out right anyhow) 
So all that we can do is try and try, try more everyday 
(Turn around, turn around the hands of time) 
If there's a will, there'll be a way 
(Do you know what's waiting there for you) 
Lord I don't know 
(Nothing's left there to go back to) 
Believe me nothing can compare what we've seen, 
time and time again 
(Turn around, turn around the hands of time) 
We've had thunder, I can stand the rain 
(Do you think it's worth all the bother) 
Someone has to do it (Nothing works out right anyhow)
Cos if the cause is right, it's always worth, all the trouble spent 
(Turn around, turn around the hands of time) 
Even in battles lost, the good win in the end 
(Do you think it's worth all the bother) 
Someone has to do it 
(Nothing works out right anyhow) 
Cos there's no river too deep, no mountain too high 
(Turn around, turn around the hands of time) 
There's nothing stopping us, we shall get by
