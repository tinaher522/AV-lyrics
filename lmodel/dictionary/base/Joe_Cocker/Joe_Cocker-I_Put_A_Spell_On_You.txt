<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="I_Put_A_Spell_On_You">
You know I love you
I loved you
Girl, I don't care if you don't want me
You know, I'm yours right now
I put a spell on you
 
I put a spell on you
Because you're mine
 
You better stop the things you do
I ain't lyin'
I ain't lyin'
 
You know I can't stand it
You're runnin' around
You know better babe
I can't stand it cause you put me down
 
I put a spell on you
Because you're mine
 
Baby
 
I put a spell on you
Because you're mine
 
Babe, you better stop the things you do
Oh, I ain't lyin'
I ain't lyin'
 
Girl, I love you
I love you
 
And I don't care
If you don't want me
You know, I'm yours right now
 
I put a spell on you
Because you're mine
 
I put a spell on you
Hey,
I put a spell on you
 
You know I love you
I loved you
Girl, I don't care if you don't want me
 
I put a spell on you
