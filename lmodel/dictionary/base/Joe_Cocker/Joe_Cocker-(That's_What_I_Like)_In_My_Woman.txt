<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="(That's_What_I_Like)_In_My_Woman">
You say she's got a mind of her own
I like that in my woman
You say she's crazy, I really don't know
That's what I love in my woman
And I think I'm gettin' crazy
I might be gettin' lazy
I just don't want to look any more
'Cause I found you
I found you
I found you
I found you
You say she wants to
Take a little stroll
Down by the river
Every evenin'
I just might take
Myself a little stroll
Down by the river
Every evenin'
I think I'm gettin' crazy
I must be gettin' lazy
I just don't want to look any more
'Cause I found you
I found you
I found you
I found you
