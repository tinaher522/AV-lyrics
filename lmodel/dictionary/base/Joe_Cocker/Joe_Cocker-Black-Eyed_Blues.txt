<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="Black-Eyed_Blues">
I need a destination of the black eyed blues
Total destination of the colour I choose
Now I don’t mind if it turned me around
Just as long as it gets fine oh it gets bound
A sudden hesitation to the black eyed shoes 
A total destination of the colour you choose
oh I don’t mind if you let it ride 
Just as long as you let it shine, oh let it shine
Tell you I need a destination of the black eyed blues
Total destination of the colour I choose  
Now I don’t mind if it turned me around
Just as long as it gets fine oh it gets bound
Oh sweet indoctrination of they old time blues
Total fascination of the colour I choose 
Whoo I don’t mind if let the poor down  
Just as long as its turning around, oh its turning around
Tell you want feel the destination of the black eyed blues
Total destination of the colour I choose  
I don’t mind witch way you want to go
Just as long as you let it show, let it show
