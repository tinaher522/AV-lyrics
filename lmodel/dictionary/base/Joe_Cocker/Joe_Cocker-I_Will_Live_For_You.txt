<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="I_Will_Live_For_You">
Selfishness always in my way
The fuse and the give
Just lost you yesterday
And living for myself
You opened up the hard way kid
You showed me what truth is
And how to give
I will live for you
I want to live for you
I will give to you
I will live for you
No more hopeless rainy nights
The fire is lit
And I'm safe inside
Just where I need to be
Where I need to be
No disguises no more games
You taught me to let go
And feel the flame
I will live for you
I want to live for you
I will give to you
I will live for you
Not losing myself this evening
Reaching out to true believing
That's a part of life's road
That held me back
For many years
Through all the pain
And all the tears
I've found you
Oh babe
You sheltered my eyes
For clear light
You made me see
You took away
The dark night
I will live for you
I want to live for you
I will give to you
I will live for you
Don't you hear me
Baby
I want to live for you
I will give to you
So badly
I want to do it for you
I will give to you
I want to live for you
I will give to you
I will live for you
Give for you
I will give to you
I'll give to you
I will live for you
I will give to you.
