<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="Moon_Dew">
Could be moon dew, falling from your eyes
Most beloved tears, climbing up the skies
And you lay awake, alone in the dark.
And you cry night after night, chain your heart
You're just running from the love I bring..
Hiding from the very thing...
I know you want..I know you need my love
Adjust the feeling, when it starts to show...
Angel how'll I ever guess, you don't want yourself to know
You haven't been here before...
"Leave love alone" you'll say...
And you cry night after night...you don't really feel that way
You're just running from the love I bring
Hiding from the very thing...
I know you want.. I know you need my loving
You've been here before
"Leave love alone" you say
Cry night after night and lay awake!
You're just running from the love I bring
Hiding from the very thing...
I know you want.. I know you need my love.
