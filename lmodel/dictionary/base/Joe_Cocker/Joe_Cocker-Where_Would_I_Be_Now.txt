<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="Where_Would_I_Be_Now">
Something deep inside
Keeps me hanging on
Don't believe I've ever seen
A night so long
Guess I tried to fly
High above the clouds
But landed here in the morning rain
At your door
I know I let you down again
But right now, you know I need a friend
I don't know why
I guess I just loose my way
Your eyes
Don't believe a word I say
I can't imagine without your love
Where would I be now
Did you ever know
I always looked up to you
and after all this time
It remains true
There's no compromise
No turning back for me
But through the veil of my pride
Sometimes it's hard to see
And I know your love is all I need
So for now don't stop believing me
Cause your love is what's helping me survive
Your faith in me is what keeps my hope alive
Without your love
Where would I be now
Cause I know your love
Is worth fighting for
And if it takes forever
I will wait at your door
Cause your love is what's helping me survive
Your faith in me is what keeps my hope alive
Without your love
Where would I be now
