<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="Do_Right_Woman">
Take me to heart and I'll always love you
And nobody can make me do wrong
Take me for granted, leavin' love, I'm sure
Makes will power weak, and it makes my temptation stir
A woman's only human, this you should understand
Oh, she's not a play thing, she's flesh and blood, just like a man.
So if you wanna do right, oh, hey, woman
You gotta be true right, oh, not my man
They say this is a man's world, but you can't prove that by me
And if we're gonna stay together, now have a little respect for me
'Cause if you wanna do right, oh, dear woman
You gotta be my true, oh not my man
You know, a woman's only human, oh, can't you understand?
I said that she's not a plaything, she flesh and blood, just like any good man
I said, if you wanna do right, oh, if you wanna do right woman
Oh! You gotta be my do right, oh, not my man
I said, you gotta be my do right, oh, not my man.
