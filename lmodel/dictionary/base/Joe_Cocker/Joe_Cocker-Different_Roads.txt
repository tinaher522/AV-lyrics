<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="Different_Roads">
Tonight I walk these city streets and 
I think about the past 
When you where mine and our love was forever 
I never thought that you would go 
Never dreamed that you would leave 
Now the taste I have is bitter sweet 
I know you had to go and find that new horizon 
Your star was calling endlessly 
In my heart I can only wish you well 
I hope you find your every dream 
We have taken different roads 
We have gone our separate ways 
Though there may be many miles between us 
In my heart the love remains 
It will not change 
Across a thousand days 
Down a different road 
Down a different road 
That old rivers turning 
But is it going anywhere 
Maybe like me it's trying to find its way back home 
But all alone can my heart rest 
How will my eyes begin to trust? 
I only want the best for the both of us 
Maybe somewhere in a different time or space 
We'll find a place where we can stay
I'll hold that moment 
Forever and for always 
I'll never be that far away 
We have taken different roads 
We have gone our separate ways 
Though there may be many miles between us 
In my heart the love remains 
It will not change across a thousand days 
Down a different road
Down a different road 
Time has been my only friend 
The truth is like a knife 
It cuts right through you 
I didn't want to lose you 
We have taken different roads 
We have gone our separate ways 
Though there may be many miles between us 
In my heart the love remains 
It will not change across a thousand days 
Down a different road 
Down a different road.
