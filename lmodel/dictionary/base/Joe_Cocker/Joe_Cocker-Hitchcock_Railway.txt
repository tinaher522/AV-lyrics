<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="Hitchcock_Railway">
Two train tickets into L.A.
One round trip the other way
Oh, I get the feelin' when forever calls
I get the feelin' when forever calls
Home trip ticket sail away
Hand grip, Hitchcoock Railway
Soft ride, made for comfort
Been tried, guaranteed passaport
Hitchcoock Railway, please don't fail to pay
Hey, I'm gonna ride, I'm gonna testify
Get my soul, lift my mind
Good stop, good day
Hitchcoock Railway
Free fare, conductor's comim
Prepare, better start runnin'
On time, hold you through now
State line, I've been convicted
Quick stop, good day
Hitchcoock Railway
Please hold on
Ooh, somebody take a train ride
Ooh, leap on
Two train tickets into L.A.
One round trip the other way
Oh, I get the feelin' where the river falls
I get the feelin' where the river falls
Home trip ticket sail away
Hand grip, Hitchcoock Railway
Soft ride, made for comfort
Been tried, guaranteed passaport
Hitchcoock Railway, please don't fail to pay
Hey, I'm gonna ride, I'm gonna testify
Get my soul, lift my mind
Good stop, good day
Hitchcoock Railway
I'm gonna take the safe way home, oh alright
I'm gonna ride a train back home
I'm gonna buy me a ticket at a station
Don't want to go on a train tonight
On a train tonight
On a train tonight
On a train tonight
