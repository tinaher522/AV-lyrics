<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="Heart_Of_The_Matter">
I've been waking at night to find you,
Staring out of our bedroom window dreaming
When I ask you if something's wrong, 
I keep hearing the same old song, you can't sin
Exposing your emotions, anymore it's just not real,
It's time to make that motion, to find that higher feel
Let's get into the heart that matters, find out what you need
Cannot love you better, won't you help me please
My love can't go any further, if you let this go to far
Let's get to the heart of the matter, or the matter is not heart
We got to sit down, try to find, 
What the trouble is on your mind, tell me
We've been loving each other too long, 
Can't let go of a love that is so strong, help me
Exposing your emotions, anymore it's just not real, 
It's time to make that motion, and find out how you feel
Let's get into the heart that matters, find out what you need,
Cannot love you better, won't you help me please
My love can't go any further, if you let this go too far
Let's get into the heart of the matter or the matter is not heart
Let's get into the heart that matters, find out what you need
Cannot love you better, won't you help me see
My love can't go any further, if you let this go too far
Let's get into the heart of the matter, before it seeks the love 
Heart of the matter...
