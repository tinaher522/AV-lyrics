<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="No_Ordinary_World">
My day starts off the same 
It looks like it might rain 
But I will not complain 
Cause I can see the sun 
I say my little prayers 
Running down the stairs 
The streets are going nowhere 
But I don't care 
Cause this day is beautiful 
Nothing's gonna get me down 
It's no ordinary world 
When you're here with me 
I take the time to smile 
I have the space to breathe 
It's no ordinary world 
When you walk with me 
I see inside my dreams 
Every diamond every pearl 
It's no ordinary world 
Everybody's got a dream 
Every thought and every scheme 
And all the spaces in between 
To see the clouds 
But I won't give it too much time 
To get inside my mind 
Cause all that really matters 
Is here and now 
When your laying close to me 
(when your bodies close to me) 
Your all the joy I need 
Your hand in mine no 
Reason to take our time 
Surrender to love like good religion.
