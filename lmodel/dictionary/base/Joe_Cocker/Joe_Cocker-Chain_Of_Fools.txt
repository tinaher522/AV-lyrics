<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="Chain_Of_Fools">
Chain, chain, chain
Chain, chain, chain
Chain, chain, chain yeah, chain of fools
For five long years
I thought you were my man
But I found out
I'm just a link in your chain
You got me where you want me
I ain't nothin' but your fool
You treated me mean,
Oh babe you treated me cruel
Chain, chain, chain
Chain, chain, chain
Chain, chain, chain yeah, chain of fools
Now, every chain
Has got a weak link
I might be weak child
Oh, but I gave you strenghy
Now,you tell me to leave you alone
My papa says "Come on home"
My doctor says "Take it easy"
But your lovin'is much too strong
I'm welded to ya
Chain, chain, chain
Chain, chain, chain
Chain, chain, chain yeah, chain of fools
One of these mornings
That chain is gonna break
But until then, I'm gomma take all I can take
Chain, chain, chain
Chain, chain, chain...
