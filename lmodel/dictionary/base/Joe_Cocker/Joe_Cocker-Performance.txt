<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="Performance">
Your performance is almost over 
When you’re through I will take you home 
To a place where the water’s always fresh and cool 
I will lay you down, take off your shoes 
Yes, the curtain is about to take your place 
There’s that sad, almost grin upon your face 
‘Cause you know you’ve done your best 
Now honey leave the rest to me and I’ll take care of you 
As they watch you fall down to your knees 
They don’t know that you’re praying to please 
They don’t see the little angel at your back with a star 
The only one who knows exactly who you are 
You’re a thing that makes music they don’t understand 
And they cheer as you carry out your endless plan 
You are weary but you must, it’s the only thing you trust 
As you live you’ve got to give 
Your performance is almost over 
When you’re through I will take you home 
You’re a ghost that I can see, you’re the other part of me 
Now honey I will take care of you 
‘Cause you know you’ve done your best 
Now honey leave the rest to me and I’ll take care of you
