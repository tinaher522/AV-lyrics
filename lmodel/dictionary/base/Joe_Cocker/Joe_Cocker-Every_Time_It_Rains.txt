<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="Every_Time_It_Rains">
Every time it rains
I sit at home and wonder why
Ever since you said goodbye
I felt so all alone
Every time it rains
And summer showers soak the ground
I watch the rain come pouring down
And I call out your name 
Every time it rains
I hang my head and want to die
And I don't seem to care that 
I'm just not making it on my own
Every time it rains
Sometimes late at night
I close my eyes
And pretend that you're here with me 
But every time it rains
I realize just how lonely my life is going to be
Every time it rains
Every time I hear the raindrops fall
I may say that I don't mind it at all 
But I do
Every time it rains
Every time I try to tell myself
That in time Iâ€™ll find somebody else
But it won't be you 
Every time it rains
Every time it rains.
