<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="Isolation">
People say we got it made don't they know we're so afraid
Isolation
We're afraid to be alone, everybody got to have a home
Isolation
Just a boy and a little girl
Trying to change the whole wide world
Isolation
All the world is a little town
Everybody trying to put us down
Isolation
I don't expect you to understand
After you caused so much pain
But then again you're not to blame
Your just a human, a victim of the insane
We're afraid of everyone, afraid of the sun
Isolation
The Sun will never disappear
But the world my not have many years
Isolation.
