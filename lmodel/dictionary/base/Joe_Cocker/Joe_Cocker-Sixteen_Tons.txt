<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="Sixteen_Tons">
Well some people say a man is made out of mud
A poor man's made out of muscle and blood
Muscle and blood oh and skin and bone
A mind that's a-weak and a back that's strong
He loaded sixteen tons and what do he get
He got another day older and deeper in debt
Well fate, you can't call me 'cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store
Well, I was born one mornin' when the sun didn't shine
I picked up my shovel and I started to the mine
I loaded sixteen tons of number nine coal
And the tone boss said, "Well bless his soul"
He loaded sixteen tons and what do he get
He got another day older and deeper in debt
Well fate, you can't call me 'cause I can't go
Well I owe my soul to the company store
Well if you see me comin', you better step aside
A lot of men didn't and a lot of men died
Well one fist of iron, the other of steel
Well if the right one don't get ya, then the left one will
He loaded sixteen tons and what do he get
He got another day older and deeper in debt
Well fate, you can't call me 'cause I can't go
Well I owe my soul to the company store
