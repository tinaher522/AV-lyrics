<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="Two_Wrongs">
I was sitting in a bar 
She got out of a great big limousine car 
Started drinking pink ladies 
Like they were going out of style 
I said "Hey, what's your name?" 
She said "Oh men, they're all the same, 
Come over here and keep me accompanied for a while" 
It's never black or white 
But sometimes in the dark of the night 
Two wrongs can make a right 
 
She said "I got money, I have fame 
I got a man at home and he's so well trained 
I got fancy clothes and a microwave oven 
One thing I don't have is some good lovin'" 
 
It's never black or white 
But sometimes in the dark of the night 
Two wrongs can make a right 
You do the best you can 
Lonely people understand 
Two wrongs can make a right 
 
We went fast, we went far 
In the backseat of that limousine car 
Sometimes in the night 
Two wrongs can't make a right 
 
Well now the sun was coming up 
She dropped me off where she picked me up 
She said "Let's do this again sometime"
But before I knew it she was out of mind 
It's never black or white 
But sometimes in the dark of night 
Two wrongs can make a right 
 
You do the best you can 
Lonely people understand 
Two wrongs can make a right...
