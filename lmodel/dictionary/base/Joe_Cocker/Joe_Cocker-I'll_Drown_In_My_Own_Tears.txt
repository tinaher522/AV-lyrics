<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="I'll_Drown_In_My_Own_Tears">
It brings a tear into my eyes 
When I begin to realize
I cried so much since you've been gone,
I guess I'll drown in my own tears.
I sit and cry tears like a child, 
My pouring tears are running wild.
If you don't think you'll be home soon,
I guess I'll drown in my own tears.
I know it's true into each life 
Some rain must pour,
I'm so blue without you 
It keeps rainin' more and more.
Why can't you come on home 
So i won't be all alone.
If you don't think you'll be home soon,
I guess I'll drown in my own tears,
I guess I'll drown in my own tears,
I guess I'll drown in my own tears,
I guess I'll drown in my own tears,
I guess I'll drown in my own tears,
I guess I'll drown in my own tears.
