<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="You_Took_It_So_Hard">
You're not sure how long it's been
Too long is all I know
You never knew what happened when
Your lover just had to go
Couldn't look you in the eye
Never really said goodbye
Even though you didn't cry 
Sometimes you wished you could have 
You took it so hard
When that world came crashing down ... on you
You picked up your heart
All those pieces on the ground ... of you
Swore you'll never love again
Couldn't see a new day when?? 
Everything would turn around
Your heart would finally mend
All the love lost would be found
With someone new again
And you'd finally forget
All the sorrow and regret
Close your eyes and take a breath
And let another lover heal you
Cause you took it so hard
When that world came crashing down... on you
You picked up your heart
All those pieces on the ground ... of you
Your afraid to love again
You can't see a new day when??
They tell you keep the faith
That's all its gonna take
But you know they are mistaken
It takes a lot of faith and courage
What if I would say to you
That not all love goes bad
What if I could show you
Would you ever take the chance
If I proved it with a sign
Turned the tear drops into wine
Would it make up for the time
Your trust was shattered
And you took it so hard
When that world came crashing down ... on you
You picked up your heart
All those pieces on the ground... of you
You took it so hard
Swore you'll never love again
You picked up your heart 
Couldn't see a new day when
You took it so hard
You took it so hard.
