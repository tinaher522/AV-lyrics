<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="Love_Don't_Live_Here_Anymore">
You abandoned me
Love don't live here any more
Just awake and see
Love don't live here any more
When you lived inside of me
There was nothing I could've seen
That you wouldn't do for me
Trouble seemed so far away
You changed them right away
And you abandoned me
Love don't live here any more
Just awake and see
Love don't live here any more
Love don't live here any more
Just emptiness and memories
Of what we had before
You went away
Find another place to stay
Another home
You abandoned me
Love don't live here any more
Just awake and see
Love don't live here any more
Oh no
And windows of my eyes
Everyone can see
The loneliness inside of me
Why do you have to go away?
Don't you know, I miss you so
And need your love?
You abandon me
Love don't live here any more
Just awake and see
You don't love me anymore
No love, oh no
You abandon me
Love don't live here any more
Just awake and see
You don't love me anymore
No love
You abandon me
Love don't, love don't
Live in no more
