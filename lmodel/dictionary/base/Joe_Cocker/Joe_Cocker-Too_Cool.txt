<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="Too_Cool">
Its too late
It's too late for tears
Cause you know tonight one thing is clear
I could sit at home and cry
Useless as it is
Or I can try to love again
I'll be too cool
Too cool for words
Too cool, to ever get hurt, too cool
It's a lesson I've learned from you
You've got to be (cool)
So long to yesterday
Goodbye is the price you pay
You think that I was the fool
But baby, you broke all the rules
Not too (cool)
I'm all right, I'll soon be better
Cause you know
Heart aches don't last forever
You went and left me cold
Searching for somebody new
But you'll come home
And when you do
I'll be, too cool
Too cool for words
Too cool, to ever get hurt, too cool
It's a lesson I learned from you
Got to be cool
Too cool
Too cool for words
Got to be cool
Too cool
