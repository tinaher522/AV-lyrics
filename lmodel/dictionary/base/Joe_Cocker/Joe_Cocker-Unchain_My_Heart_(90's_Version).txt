<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="Unchain_My_Heart_(90's_Version)">
Unchain my heart
Baby let me be
'Cause you don't care
Let me
Set me free
Unchain my heart
Baby let me go
Unchain my heart
'Cause you don't love me no more
Every time I call you on the phone
Some fella tells me that you're not at home
Unchain my heart
Set me free 
Unchain my heart
Baby let me be
Unchain my heart
'Cause you don't care a bag of beans 
about me
You've got me sowed up like a mellow case
But you let my love go to waste
Unchain my heart
Set me free 
I'm under your spell
Like a man in a trance baby
Oh but you know darn well
That I don't stand a chance
Unchain my heart
Let me go let me go my way
Unchain my heart

You worry me night and day
Why lead me through a life of misery
When you don't care about the beans for me
Unchain my heart oh please
Set me free
Girl Alright
I'm under your spell
Just like a man in a trance oh baby
But you know darn well 
That I don't stand a chance
Please unchain my heart
Let me go my way
Unchain my heart
You are in my night and day
Why leave me to a life of misery
When you don't care bag of beans for me
Unchain my heart
Please set me free
Oh set me free
now woman why don't you do that for me
oh You don't care
Won't you let me go
cause you don't love me no more
Like a man in a trance
let me go
I'm under your spell
Like a man in a trance
And you know darn well
That I don't stand a chance no
Oh
You don't care
Please set me free
