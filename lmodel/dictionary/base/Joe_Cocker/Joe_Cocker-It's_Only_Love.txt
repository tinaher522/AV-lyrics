<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="It's_Only_Love">
It's never too late to turn a night into day
I'll meet you halfway and we'll see it through
We're just standing here 
There's only me and you
Don't tell me you don't feel it
Cause I feel it too
Well these dreams we can use 
God’s grace is living proof
We'll take the time, and get it right
So come on, come on, come on
I know we can make it
I'll hold you in my arms
It's only love that keeps us strong
So come on, come on, come on
So much we've wasted
We're right where we belong
It’s only love that keeps us strong
Never too late to finally take a second chance
And I saw mine, when I saw you
Everything changed the moment we began again
Our broken hearts were pulling through
Something real, something close
Helped us feel, and let us go 
So here we are, now we know
So come on, come on, come on
I know we can make it
I'll hold you in my arms
It's only love that keeps us strong
So come on, come on, come on
So much time we've wasted
We're right where we belong
It’s only love that keeps us strong
I have been a beggar
And you have been a fool
We've been lost beyond repair
But you have touched my soul
And I have bent your rules
Only love could save us
Show us what we're made of
So come on, come on, come on
I know we can make it
I'll hold you in my arms
It's only love that keeps us strong
So come on, come on, come on
So much time we've wasted
We're right where we belong
It’s only love that keeps us strong.
