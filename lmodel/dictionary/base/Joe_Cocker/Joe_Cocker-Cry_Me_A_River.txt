Why don't you, why don't you, why don't you
Cry me a river
Now you say that you're lonely
After being so untrue
I want you to cry (cry me a river)
Won't you cry (cry me a river)
All over me (cry me a river)
I want you to cry (cry me a river)
Yeah, over me (cry me a river)
Hey, yeah, cry (cry me a river)
Yeah, I cried a river over you
Now you say that you're sorry
Oh, for bein' so unkind
I want you to cry (cry me a river)
Cry for me (cry me a river)
Oh (cry me a river)
Over me (cry me a river)
Want you to cry (cry me a river)
Right on me, yeah (cry me a river)
Oh, I cried a river over you
You drove me nearly drove me out of my head
Never shed a tear
Remember, I remember all that you said
Told me love was too plebeian
You were through with me
(Cry me a river)
Oh yeah (cry me a river)
Want you to cry (cry me a river)
Cry me a river (cry me a river)
Oh, cry (cry me a river)
Cry me a river (cry me a river)
Oh, I cried a river over you
You drove me nearly drove me out of my head
Ooh, never shed a tear
Remember, I remember all that you said
Told me love was too plebeian
You were through with me
(Cry me a river)
Yes (cry me a river)
I want you to cry (cry me a river)
Cry me a river (cry me a river)
Ah (cry me a river)
Cry me (cry me a river)
Oh, I cried a river over you
Yeah, I cried a river over you
(I cried a river over you)
Over you (I cried a river over you)
Over you (I cried a river over you)
Ah (I cried a river over you)
Let me (I cried a river over you)
Cried a river (I cried a river over you)
Cry me a river (I cried a river over you)
Over you, my baby (I cried a river over you)
(I cried a river over you)
Let me cry a river over you
(One, two, three, four)
(Cry me a river, cry me a river)
(Cry me a river, cry me a river)
Yeah (cry me a river)
Oh baby (cry me a river)
Cry a river over you
