<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="Love_Not_War">
Just 24 hours ago the sound my heart made as it broke
Echoed across the room and cut right through the words you spoke.
I don't wanna fight till 3 a.m. Wake up red eyed and start again
My tears won't solve a thing
Do you ever know what you’re fighting for?
Baby cause I can't take it any more
Let’s make love not war
We can get it back like it used to be
Lay down your arms baby come to me
Let's make love not war
If love is oxygen we're cutting off the air supply
You sting and I can't breathe
I need to know, the reason why
If I’ve been hard to handle I’m the first to apologise
'Cuz baby this goes both ways
Do you even know what you're fighting for?
Baby cause I can't take it any more
Let’s make love not war
We can get it back like it used to be
Lay down your arms baby come to me
Let's make love not war.
