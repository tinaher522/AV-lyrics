<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="Boogie_Baby">
Hard to say I can see 
The writing on the wall 
I knew the time would come again 
When you would fall 
Pray to the man who lives in the shadow 
Show him you're the light 
Show him you're the light, boogie baby 
You're my lady, my lady, boogie baby 
I was gonna write you a fast song 
Pretty love song 
Make it a big rock and roll song 
So I could watch you sway, watch you sway 
(I could) Watch you sway, boogie baby 
Where did you boogie tonight 
You meet his eyes, steal away 
I will never know the fire burnin' there 
Leavin' me stoned and cold 
Here's to the man who lives in the shadows 
Show him you're the light 
Show him you're the light, boogie baby 
You're my lady, my lady, boogie baby 
I was gonna write you a fast song 
Pretty love song 
Make it a big rock and roll song 
So I could watch you sway, watch you sway 
Boogie baby, boogie baby 
Oh where'll you boogie tonight.
