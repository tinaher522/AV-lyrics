<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="Standing_Knee_Deep_In_A_River">
Friends I could count on,
I could count on one hand,
With a leftover finger or two.
I took 'em for granted,
Let 'em all slip away.
Now where they are, I wish I knew.
They roll by just like water,
And I guess we never learn.
Go through life parched and empty,
Standin' knee deep in a river and dyin' of thirst.
Sometimes I remember.
Sweethearts I've known.
Some I've forgotten, I suppose.
One or two still linger,
Oh, and I wonder now,
Why I ever let them go.
They roll by just like water,
And I guess we never learn.
Go through life parched and empty,
Standin' knee deep in a river and dyin' of thirst.
So the sidewalk is crowded:
The city goes by.
And I rush through another day,
And a world full of strangers,
Turn their eyes to me,
But I just look the other way
They roll by just like water,
And I guess we never learn.
Go through life parched and empty,
Standin' knee deep in a river and dyin' of thirst.
They roll by just like water,
And I guess we never learn.
Go through life parched and empty,
Standin' knee deep in a river and dyin' of thirst.
