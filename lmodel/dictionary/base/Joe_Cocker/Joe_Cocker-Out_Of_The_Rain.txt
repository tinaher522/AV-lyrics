<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="Out_Of_The_Rain">
Out of the rain, under the shelter 
I've been so long where the sun don't shine
Standing at the cross-roads, could have went ither way 
But now I've found you and the storm is behind 
Out of the rain, out of the rain 
Over the wall, I'm out in the open 
Back on the right track, I'm feeling no pain 
You took a sparrow and let it fly with the eagles 
I can see a long ways, I feel love again 
Out of the rain, out of the rain 
There was a time I was taking no prisoners 
Standing with a cold heart, standing alone 
It took your sweet love to pull me out of the canyon 
I believe I can make it now, I feel like I belong 
Out of the rain, out of the rain 
Out of the rain, out of the rain
