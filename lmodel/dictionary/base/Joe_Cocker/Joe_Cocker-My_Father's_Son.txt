<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="My_Father's_Son">
Heart over mind, yes I’m my father's son 
I live my life, just like my father's done 
If he'd told me, one day that somebody'd have my heart in chains 
Would I believe it, no way 
Made up my mind I’d never fall that way 
But tell me why 
Every time I try, to tell you it's goodbye 
I can't seem to let go 
In my heart I know I want to stay 
What I’m trying to say 
Heart over mind, yes I’m my father's son 
Yes I’m inclined to do as my father's done 
My father's son
And I need my life
As my father's done
Here I am with you and I know that it's true 
Despite all the feelings you’re putting me through 
I try to walk away, something makes me stay 
Heart over mind, yes I’m my father's son 
I live my life, just like my father's done 
But tell me why 
Every time I try, to tell you it's goodbye 
I just can't seem to let go 
In my heart, I know I want to stay, never run away 
My father's son 
I live my life, as my father's done 
If he'd told me, one day 
That somebody would have my heart in 
Chains would I believe it, no way 
Made up my mind, I’d never fall that way 
But it's heart over mind, yes I’m my father's son.
