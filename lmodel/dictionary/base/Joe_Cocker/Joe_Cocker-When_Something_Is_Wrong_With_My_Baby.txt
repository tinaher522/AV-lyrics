<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="When_Something_Is_Wrong_With_My_Baby">
When something is wrong with my baby
Something is wrong with me
If I don't know, she's worried
Then I would feel that same misery
We've been through so much together
We've been as one and that's what makes it better
When something is wrong with my baby
Something is wrong with me
And what she, what she means to me now
You, you wouldn't understand
Some people would say that she's no good
Oh, she's my woman and you know I'm her man
If she's got a problem, I'd know
You'd know I've gotta help her solve it
When something is wrong with my baby
Something is wrong with me
When something is wrong with my baby
Something is wrong with me
When something is wrong with my baby
Something is wrong with me
