<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="Soul_Time">
I feel life passing me by
A little more each day
We don't act out our love
In that old sweet and simple way
The world's got problems baby
We've got problems too
Why don't we work together
And see what we can do
Take a little soul time
Say what's weighing on our minds
Take a little soul time
There's no telling what we'll find
Let's love life and live it
Stop fighting and crying
Start hanging together
And reaching and trying
This time
Take a little soul time
There's still a place we can do
Inside you and me
To change our life as it is
Into life as it should be
Unless angels, baby
Answer if we call
All our hopes and dreams
They won't let us fall
Take a little soul time
Say what's weighing on our minds
Take a little soul time
There's no telling what we'll find
Let's love life and live it
Stop fighting and crying
Start hanging together
And reaching and trying
This time
Take a little soul time
We could be so fine, so fine
If we just lay it on the line this time
Take a little soul time
Say what's weighing on our minds
Take a little soul time
There's no telling what we'll find
Let's love life and live it
Stop fighting and crying
Start hanging together
And reaching and trying
This time
Take a little soul time
