THAT'S YOUR BUSINESS NOW
If you glad that you've got nothing to say
If you glad that you've nowhere to pray
Oh, baby, that's your business now
If you glad that you've got nothing to do
Don't you know I'm depending' on you
Hey, baby, that's your business now
When it's all over and you're lying in your rug
And then you start to feel that certain kind of bug
Don't feel uneasy, just give her a knee
She's just some woman trying to get some speed, yeah
If you glad that you've got nothing to feel
If you glad that its al so real
Hey, baby, somebody shine on me
Lay down.
Back into bridge [?]
When that's all over and you're sitting in your rug
Then you starting to get that sweet old passing bug
Oh, don't feel uneasy, just give her a knee 
Just some woman trying to get some speed, Lord.
If you glad that you've got nothing to hide
If you glad that you've got nothing to decide
Hey, baby, that's your business now
If you glad that you've got nowhere to weep
If you glad that you've got nothing to seep 
Hey, sweetie, that's your business now
If you glad
Oh, if you glad
That you don't feel bad
If you glad
Oh, if you glad
If you glad than don't feel bad
