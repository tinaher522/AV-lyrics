<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="Now_That_You're_Gone">
Are you still that little girl who used to talk to me?
Just look how far we've come in this world
Where did you think we'd be?
You think the world wakes up at noon
And you left it all behind
You hear the music but you've lost the tune
The melodies are hard to find.
Why did you go away
Leaving me alonez
There's nothing left to say
Now that you're gone -
Now that you're gone - now that you're gone.
In the eyes of the woman i see
You were lust a child
Not the one who's walking the streets
Not the one who's running wild.
Say life has changed that much
You don't want to know
All the love we shared in this world
Not so long ago.
Why did you go away
Leaving me alone? ...
Why did you go away
Leaving me all alone?...
Now that you're gone
Now that you're gone.
