<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="She_Believes_In_Me">
I'm tossing and turning and I can't get to sleep 
Got something on my mind I just can't release 
Then she whispers so softly that she believes in me 
If I let her down and tried to disguise it 
She always see's through it always replies that 
No matter what I do she believes in me 
All the times I failed gone slightly off the rails 
She's there to remind me she believes in me 
When it all goes wrong and I feel I'm on my own 
She's there to remind me she believes in me 
Don't get me wrong I'm not some kind of fool 
I'd give her my world if she asked me to 
Cuz here's no denying she believes in me 
But I'm only human I'm just a guy 
That sometimes makes mistakes and I can't explain why 
Some say she's crazy but she believes in me 
All the times I failed gone slightly off the rails 
She's there to remind me she believes in me 
When it all goes wrong and I feel I'm on my own 
She's there to remind me she believes in me 
She believes in me in what I do 
She believes in me I need her too 
She believes in God above 
She believes when we make love 
All the times I failed gone slightly off the rails 
She's there to remind me she believes in me 
When it all goes wrong and I feel I'm on my own 
She's there to remind me she believes in me 
Ya she's there to remind me she believes in me 
Ya she's there to remind me she believes in me 
Ya she's there to remind me she believes in me
