<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="Sail_Away">
Cut all your ties and come along 
The winds of change are blowing strong 
Your time is here, so take it 
And I know you make it right, make it right 
Life is short, no time to wait 
The tide is high, dont hesitate 
Time is precious, please dont waste it 
This is your life, so make it right, make it right 
Sail away, you can fly 
On the wings of freedom you can reach the sky 
Sail away, dream your dreams 
You will always find a way to make your feelings come true 
A going stuff for me and you 
And you keep going right on through 
Your time is here, so take it 
In the end, I know, you make it right, make it right 
Sail away... 
See how time just slips away 
Today was tomorrow yesterday 
When you see a chance, then take it 
When you find love, so make it right, make it right 
Sail away... 
On this wings of freedom, you can reach the sky 
Sail away, dream your dreams...
