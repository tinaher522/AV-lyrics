<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="Lady_Put_The_Lights_Out">
Lady, put the light out, come and love me one more time
I will disconnect the 'phone
Then we will be all alone
Lady, put the light out, come and love me one more time
Lady, I want to tell you just how good you've always been
There were times when I thought I'd lose my way
But thanks to you girl, I'll always stay
Hey lady, take it easy, yeah, you can leave the rest to me
And I'll put the music on soft and low
And we'll play it all over again
We won't open our eyes until the end, end
Lady, put the light out, come and love me one more time
Hey, lady, put the light out, and you can leave the rest to me
I'll put the music on soft and low
And we'll play it all over again
We won't open our eyes until the end, the end
Lady, put the light out, come and love me one more time.
