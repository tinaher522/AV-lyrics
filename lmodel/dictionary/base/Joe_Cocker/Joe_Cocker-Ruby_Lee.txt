<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="Ruby_Lee">
Staring at shadows on the wall
Wish I knew of someone I could call
Someone who might understand it all
Ruby Lee, sure wish you were here with me
Someone lying with me in my bed
Some stranger who don't understand my head
Wish it was you lying here instead
Ruby Lee, sure wish you were here with me
Drowning in a sea of pretty faces
Being quite the man about the town
Packing up and going pretty places
But I sure miss you around
Listen to the noises down the hall
Think I'll move out of here in the fall
Ain't exactly having me a ball
Ruby Lee, sure wish you were here with me
Drowning in a sea of pretty faces
Being quite the man about the town
Packing up and going pretty places
But I sure miss you around
Listen to the noises down the hall
Wishin' there was someone out to call
Ain't exactly having me a ball
Ruby Lee, sure wish you were here with me
