<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="I_Know_(You_Don't_Want_Me_No_More)">
I know you don't love me no more
No more no no more
And I don't want to be hurt anymore
(No more) anymore (no more)
Yeah yeah I have loved so hard
Everything I did was no dard
If I can't love you right baby
I don't have to love you at all
I know (I know) you don't want me no more
No more (no more) no no more
And it has to be someone else lovin' you more
(No more) lovin' you more (no more)
Ain't no use in me cryin' now
If not for you I wouldn't be down
Don't want me no more baby
Ain't no use in you hangin' round
I know no more no more
No more no more
I know (I know) you don't want me no more
No more (no more) no no more
And it has to be someone else lovin' you more
(No more) lovin' you more (no more)
Ain't no use in me cryin' now
If not for you I wouldn't be down
Don't want me no more baby
Ain't no use in you hangin' round
I know (I know) I know (I know)...
