<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="You_Don't_Know_What_You're_Doing_To_Me">
When moonlight casts a shadow, on the shores of make believe 
I play the part, of the fallen start 
I spiral down to the ground to where you are 
 
Inspired by the feeling, of loving from afar 
I play the tune of the all consumed 
I'm mystified, preoccupied over the moon 
 
You don't know what you're doing to me 
My dreams about you never seem to sleep 
Well my heart is near exhaustion, by the rapid pace it keeps 
You don't know what you're doing to me 
 
What kind of competition, yields such a lovely prize 
A silly game but the only way 
So deal me in if I'm to win I have (I've got) to play 
 
You don't know what you're doing to me 
My dreams about you never seem to sleep 
Well my heart is near exhaustion, by the rapid pace it keeps 
You don't know what you're doing to me 
My whole world is getting smaller 
I just want to matter to you 
Look at me, I'm such a mess 
There's nothing else (not a thing) for me to do 
 
You don't know what you're doing to me 
My dreams about you never seem to sleep 
Well my heart is near exhaustion, by the rapid pace it keeps 
You don't know what you're doing 
You don't know what you're doing 
No, you don't know what you're doing 
To me.
