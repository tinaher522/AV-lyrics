What do you say to someone who’s hurtin’ so bad
Who’s feelin’ so sad, when they’re the best friends you’ve ever had?
What do you say to someone who’s hurtin’ so bad?
Tell me, what do you say to someone that you love so much
When they say they’re losin’ touch and they’ve enough?
What do you say to someone that loves you so much?
You say everything and everything or nothin’ at all
And the more that you fear, the further you fall
Say anything and everything or nothin’ at all
To someone you love, to someone like you
 
What do you say to someone at the end of the mile
Who’s run out of time? Then they say they feel like dyin’
What do you say to someone at the end of their line?
 
You say everything and everything or nothin’ at all
And the more that you fear, the further you fall
Say anything and everything or nothin’ at all
To someone you love, to someone like you
 
Now I tell you something that you ought to know
Life’s meant to live and love’s meant to grow
And people will come and people, they will go
 
You say everything and everything or nothin’ at all
And the more that you fear, the further you fall
Say anything and everything or nothin’ at all
To someone you love, to someone like you
 
What do you say to someone who’s hurtin’ so bad
Someone who’s loosing the touch, someone who loves you so much
What do you say, someone who’s hurtin’ without
To say anything and everything, or maybe nothin’ at all.
