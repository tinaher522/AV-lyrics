<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="Respect_Yourself">
If you disrespect everybody that you run into
How in the world do you think anybody 'sposed to respect you
If you don't give a heck about the man with the Bible in his hand
Just get out the way and let the gentleman do his thing
You're the kind of gentleman that wants everything their way
Take the sheet off your face boy, it's a brand new day
Respect yourself
Respect yourself
If you don't respect yourself
Ain't nobody gonna give a good hoot, na- na- na
Respect yourself 
Respect yourself
If you're walking around thinking that the word owes you
Something cause you're here
You're going out the world backwards like you did when you first came her
You keep talking about the president won't stop air pollution
Put your hand over your mouth when you cough that'll help the solution
You cuss around women and you don't even know their names
Then You're dumb enough to think that it makes you a big ol' man
Respect yourself
Respect yourself
If you don't respect yourself
Ain't nobody gonna give a good hoot, na- na- na
Respect yourself 
Respect yourself
Respect yourself 
Respect yourself 
Respect yourself 
Respect yourself 
Respect yourself 
Respect yourself 
Respect yourself
