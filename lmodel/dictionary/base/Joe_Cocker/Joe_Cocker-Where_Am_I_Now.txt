<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="Where_Am_I_Now">
Morning sun risin'
On an empty avenue
No surprise
Memorizin' faces I once new
But there's a stranger
In the mirror
Seems familiar
Like a sketch
That I once drew
I thought time
Was my partner
Now my clock is frozen so it seems
Used to be
My own best friend was me
There's a stranger
In the mirror
Seems familiar
Like a sketch
That I once drew
Where am I now
When I need me
Where am I now
When I need me
I been livin' for myself
I been around or so it seems
Used to be
My own best friend was me
But there's this thing in the mirror now
Seems familiar
Like a sketch
That I once drew
Where am I now
When I need me
Where am I now
When I need me
