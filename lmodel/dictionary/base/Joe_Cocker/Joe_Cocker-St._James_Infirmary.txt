<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="St._James_Infirmary">
I went down to St.James infirmary
To see my baby there
She was stretched out on a cold white table
So sweet...so lean...and so fair
Let her go...let her go...god bless her
Wherever she may be
She can search the whole wide world
But she'll never find another man like me
When I die you can bury me in plain lace shoes
Stetson with a twenty dollar hat
And put a thirty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
And let the fellas know that I died standing pat
I went down to St.James infirmary
And I stole my baby back
She was stretched out on a long white table
So sweet...so cold...and so fair
