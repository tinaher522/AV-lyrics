<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="Heart_Full_Of_Rain">
A heart full of rain and memories 
I'm feeling the strain and missing you so desperately 
I need the shelter of your arms tonight oh baby, 
I need you by my side 
I don't know why things go the way they do 
They just keep taking me down 
I can't deny I’m so into you 
And lost when you’re not around 
If I could hold you 
I could let go of the pain 
But tonight I’ve got a heart full of rain 
Unkind words blindly spoken faith was broken 
And you walked away from the world 
Our love has created hope has faded 
Return your flame to this heart full of rain 
A heart full of rain and memories 
Love's not in vain even if you should say 
You no longer need me 
I'll keep believing until all that remains 
Is your memories and a heart full of rain 
Your memory and a heart full of rain.
