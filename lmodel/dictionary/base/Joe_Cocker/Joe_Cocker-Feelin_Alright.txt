<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="Feelin_Alright">
Seems I've got to have a change of scene
'Cause ev'ry night I have the strangest dreams;
Imprisoned by the way it could have been,
Left here on my own or so it seems.
I've got to leave before I start to scream,
But someone locked the door and took the key.
You feelin' alright
I'm not feelin' too good myself.
Well, you feelin' alright
I'm not feelin' too good myself.
Well boy, you sure took me for one big ride,
And even now I sit and wonder why,
That when I think of you I start myself to cry,
I just can't waste my time, I must keep dry.
Gotta stop believing in all your lies,
'Cause there's too much to do before I die.
You feelin' alright...
Don't get too lost in all I say,
Yeah by the time, you know, I really felt that way.
But that was then; Now, you know, it's today,
I just can't get off so I'm here to stay.
'Til someone comes along and takes my place,
With a different name, oh, a different face
You feeling alright...
