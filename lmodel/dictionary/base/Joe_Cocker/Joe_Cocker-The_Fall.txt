<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="The_Fall">
Strange how this world works
I don't care about your place
You better believe you're gonna get her
You gotta let go, it's out of your hands
One day you're gonna look back
See the reason that you got back
It's all in the fall
That's when you find out what you're all about
We've all been hurt, we've all been burnt
You get knocked down, kicked around, then you get back up
It's all in the fall, starting over again, starting over again
Somebody once told me
Trouble is trouble's gonna be coming your way
When the world gets dark and lonely
You might stumble and fall but you get through it all
It's gonna be okay
One day you're gonna look back
And see it all happen so damn fast, so fast
It's all in the fall
That's when you find out what you're all about
We've all been hurt, we've all been burnt
You get knocked down, kicked around and then you get back up
It's all in the fall
You don't know who you are till it all comes tumbling down
Next thing you know you've found
That it's all in the fall
That's when you find out what you're all about
Yes, it's all in the fall
That's when you find out what you're all about
We've all been hurt, we've all been burnt
You get knocked down, kicked around and then you get back up
It's all in the fall, it's all in the fall, starting over again
Starting over again.
