<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="Just_Pass_It_On">
You don't owe me, ha! I'll be hoping, ha!
I'll be praying, ha!
Toombo iso, ha! toombo iso, ha!
Toombo iso, ha!
You don't owe me, you don't owe me a solitary thing.
If I lend a hand it's 'cause I choose to.
You don't owe me.
(Just pass it on.) Pass it on, pass it on. (Pass it on.)
Help make the world go round. (Pass it on.)
Pass it on to who ever you need, they won't owe you.
Toombo iso, ha! toombo iso, ha!
I'll be hoping, I'll be hoping for the big one out of the blue,
When it comes I want it to come to you.
I'll be hoping.
(Just pass it on.) Pass it on, pass it on. (Pass it on.)
Hope makes the world go round. (Pass it on.)
Pass it on to who ever you need, they won't owe you.
Toombo iso, ha! toombo iso, ha!
I'll be praying, I'll be praying that the best will come your way.
And when it comes that's going to make my day.
I'll be praying.
(Just pass it on.) Pass it on, pass it on. (Pass it on.)
Hope makes the world go round. (Pass it on.)
Pass it on to who ever you need, they won't owe you.
You don't owe me, no you don't.
I'll be hoping, ha!
I'll be praying, ha!
Toombo iso, ha! toombo iso...
