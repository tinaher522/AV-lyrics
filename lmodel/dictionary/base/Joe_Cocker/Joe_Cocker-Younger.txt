<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="Younger">
I'm gonna learn to play the blues guitar
I'm gonna drive a fast Italian car
I'm gonna jump out off a plane and fly
I'm gonna find the lord and testify
I'm gonna look within and figure out
What this thing called life is all about 
When I get young...younger
When I get young...younger
I'm gonna dance with fools and dine with kings
Gonna hear the bells of Paris ring
I'm gonna carve an angel out off wood
I'm gonna give up cigarettes for good
I'm gonna find the perfect words to say
So the one I love won't walk away
When I get young...younger
When I get young...younger
They're all on my list of things to do
I'll get to them all before I'm through
And what's still on my plate
When the clock winds down
Will just have to wait till my next time around
I'm gonna try to lose a pound or two
I'm gonna sit back and admire the view
I'm gonna memorize a Dylan song
Fix all the things that I've done wrong
And I'll appreciate the friends I've got
Maybe give true love another shot
When I get young...younger
When I get young...younger
When I get young...younger
When I get young...younger
I'm gonna find my way back home
When I get younger, some day.
