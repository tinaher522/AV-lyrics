<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="Fun_Time">
Got a few jingles jangle in my pocket
And I got a couple that don't make no noise
See, I'm all fired up just like a rocket
And the stars above are just a few of my toys
It's fun time, it's fun time
Let yourself be happy, it's fun time
Shake time, you deserve a break time
It's fun time for U S all
I've got a new resolution
That is if my mojo wanna disco hand
Got my mind set on a good time
You can come along whatever shape you're in
It's fun time, fun time
Let yourself be happy, it's fun time
Shake time, you deserve a break time
It's fun time for U S all
Sayin' it's fun time, fun time
Let yourself be happy, it's fun time
Shake time, you deserve a break time
It's fun time for U S all
Fun time, fun time
Let yourself be happy, it's fun time
Shake time, you deserve a break time
It's fun time for U S all
