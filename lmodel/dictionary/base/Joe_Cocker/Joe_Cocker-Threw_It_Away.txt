<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="Threw_It_Away">
I'm not a pauper or a millionaire
Doin' all my living on a song and a prayer.
I played to win and took the lion's share - so sweet.
Memories of friends upon my wall
When I met you I thought that I had it all
Too young to understand the mighty fall - so easy.
Still I threw it away
just' when I had it
I threw it away
Just when I held it
I threw it away
That precious feeling
I threw it away - just when I really cared.
Conversation in a crowded room
I hear the music but I'm not out of tune.
You never learn until your chance is had - and gone.
.rew it away
just when I had it
I threw it away
. . .
Oh
but I th
Memories of friends upon my wall
.
Tellin' you
I threw it away
when I had it
I threw it away
. ..
That precious feeling
oh no.
