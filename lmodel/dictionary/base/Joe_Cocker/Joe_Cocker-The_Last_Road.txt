<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="The_Last_Road">
I don't want to live forever 
Though I wish for nothin' better 
Than forever with you 
Baby don'cha say you're leaving 
Ain't no way I'll stop believing 
Just hold on tight 
Hold on tight 
To me 
Burn the headlights 
Till the night is gone 
Pull me closer 
If you say it's over 
Then you're wrong 
Cause this ain't the last road 
The brave ones never run home 
Tonight we will live fast 
And die young 
We never dance alone 
Tonight 
We could drive a million places 
And listen to a million places 
And listen to a million stations 
You know 
I'll sing along 
With you 
Burn the headlights 
Till the night is gone 
Pull me closer 
If you say it's over 
Then you're wrong 
'Cause this ain't the last road 
The brave ones never run home 
Tonight we live fast 
And die young 
But we never dance alone 
'Cause this ain't the last road 
We'll pave the highway in gold 
Stand by and me and don't leave 
Lonely 
This ain't the last road 
Have a lil' faith in me 
Hold on 
Hold on 
'Cause I don't believe 
In time 
This time 
Don't say goodnight 
'Cause babe it's our last road 
We'll pave the highway in gold 
Won't take a single step 
Without you 
Without you by my side 
'Cause this ain't the last road 
'Cause this ain't the last road 
The brave ones never run home 
Tonight we live fast 
And die young 
But we never dance alone 
'Cause tis ain't the last road 
Tonight 
Tonight
