<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="Pardon_Me_Sir">
Pardon me, friend
If what I'm saying don't seem right
But that's the only chance I get now, all day and night - hey
Pardon me, Sir
If what I'm saying brings you down
But that's the only way to show you that I'm a clown - uh uh, hey
I'm quite sure you understand - my baby
I'm quite sure you understand
Pardon me, friend
If what I'm saying don't ring true
But that's the only way I know now to get through to you - ooh
Well, pardon me, Sir
If what I'm doing brings you round
But that's the only place I know, Sir, it is town to town - hey
I'm quite sure you understand - my baby
Hope you do, hope you do, let me see it right now
I'm quite sure you understand
I'm quite sure you understand - my baby
I'm quite sure you understand
Yeah, pardon me, friend
If what I'm saying don't seem right
Ooh, now, but that's the only, yeah, yes, that's the only way now
Oh, that's the only, that's the only way
That's the only, oh, that's the only way I know
That's the only, that's the only way
That's the only, only thing I know ....
