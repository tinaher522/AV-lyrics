<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="I'm_So_Glad_I'm_Standing_Here_Today">
There were times 
I remember
Had to fight just to hold my head up
Those times when even my friends
Tried to make a fool of me
There were things that my heart looked at
That they just couldn't see
Some said I was hopeless
Mind tangled in the night
Strong hearts just keep goin'
That is why I'm still standing here today
Come together
Raise up your voices
This time my song of love and life won't go away
I'll sing forever
Here in the sunshine
I've lived to see the sun break through the storm 
And I'm so glad I'm standing here today.
If your lost in your troubles
And the world just seems to forget you
If you remember sunshine
Even on your darkest day
Just follow what your heart says 
And you will find the way
Some said I was hopeless
Mind tangled in the night
Strong hearts just keep goin'
That is why I'm still standing here today
Come together
Raise up your voices
This time my song of love and life won't go away
I'll sing forever
Here in the sunshine
I've lived to see the sun break through the storm 
And I'm so glad I'm standing here today.
