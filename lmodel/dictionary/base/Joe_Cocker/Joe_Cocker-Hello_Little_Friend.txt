Hello, little friend
Oh, It's good to see you back again
I'm very happy that you're bigger than me 
In such important ways you overlook
the hung up and thoughtless things I say
My dear funny friend
You may be the only one that's ever been
Even when I use you see through me with real eyes
You keep marking time
Just waiting for a friendly chance to sight the blind
Yeah, wait a minute 
Oh, you are a friend of mine
... my sweet Lord ...
Oh, darling, I say, you are a friend of mine
But if by some chance that might've slipped my mind
Little darling, I hope that you will set me straight
Don't hesitate to sharpen my reality
The hour's late ...
My dear little friend,
I'm sure you're the only one that's ever been
And if I fall again I hope that I'll find
You standing close by
Or just waiting for a friendly chance to right my mind 
Yeah please wait a minute darling
Oh, you are a friend of mine
I said, wait for me
Oh, I love you
Don't you know, you are a friend of mine
If you let it in
I said, oh my sweet oh Lord, hey you are a friend of mine
I can tell it by the way
I said Hey! Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh
You are a friend of mine
Darling, you are a friend of
Darling, you are a friend of
Darling, you are a friend of mine
