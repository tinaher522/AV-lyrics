<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="Maybe_I'm_Amazed">
Maybe I'm amazed at the way you love me all the time
Maybe I'm afraid of the way I love you
Maybe I'm amazed at the way you pulled me out of time, hung me on a line
Maybe I'm afraid at the way you really love me
Maybe I'm amazed, maybe I'm a lonely man
Who's in the middle of something
That he doesn't really understand
Maybe I'm amazed maybe you're the only woman who could ever reach me
Baby won't you help me to understand
Ooh...
Maybe I'm amazed at the way you're with me all the time
Maybe I'm afraid at the way I need you 
Maybe I'm amazed at the way you help me sing my song
You right me when I'm wrong
Maybe I'm amazed at the way you really love me 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Maybe I'm amazed, maybe you're the only woman, who could ever help me...
Baby won't you help me to understand...
Ooh,ooh,ooh,ooh,ooh,ooh,ooh,ooh,
Maybe I'm amazed, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, maybe I'm amazed
Yeah, yeah, yeah, maybe I'm amazed...
With you....
