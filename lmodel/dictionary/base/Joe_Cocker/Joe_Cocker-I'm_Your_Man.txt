<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="I'm_Your_Man">
If you want a lover
I'll do anything you ask me to
And if you want another kind of lover
I'll wear a mask for you
If you want a partner
Take my hand if you want to
Step me down in anger
Here I stand
I'm your man
If you want a boxer
I'll step in the ring for you
If you want a doctor
I'll examine every inch of you
If you want a driver come inside
If you want to take me for a ride
You know you can
I'm your man
The moon's too bright
The chain's too tight
The peace flow godessly
I've been running through
These promises to you
That I made and I just can't keep
Oh but a man that would get
A woman back
By begging on his knees
And I'd crawl to you baby
And I'd fall at your feet
But I'm howling at your beauty
Like a dog in heat
And I'd crawl at your heart
I'd tear in your sheet
I'd say please
Please, I'm your man
If you want a father for your child
Only want to open me a while
Across the sand, I'm your man
Yes I am
Anything you ask me to
I'd put on gloves
Here I stand
I would even, even wear a mask for you
I'm your man your lover
Take my hand saying please.
