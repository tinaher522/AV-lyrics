<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="I_Come_In_Peace">
You see me comin' 
You feel like runnin' 
A wicked look is in your eye 
I don't come to harm you 
I come to warn you 
It's now or never, do or die 
 
I had a vision 
A head on collision 
A revelation ya 
That sent me on a mission 
 
I come in peace 
Love is a gold mine ya 
Find it you have to seek it 
Follow the heart sign 
It's flowin' rich and deep 
And it's well within our reach 
I come in peace 
I come in peace 
 
Arrived with nothing 
And let me tell you something 
We're going out the same way 
I got your attention 
And maybe I should mention 
They'll be no rest till peace is made 
 
Love is a gold mine ya 
Find it you have to seek it 
Follow the heart sign 
It's flowin' rich and deep 
And it's well within our reach 
I come in peace 
I come in peace 
 
I had a vision 
A head on collision 
A revelation ya 
That sent me on a mission 
 
I come in peace 
Love is a gold mine ya 
Find it you have to seek it 
Follow the heart sign 
It's flowin' rich and deep 
And it's well within our reach 
I come in peace 
I come in peace.
