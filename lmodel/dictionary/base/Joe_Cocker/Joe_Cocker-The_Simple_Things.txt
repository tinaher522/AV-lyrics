<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="The_Simple_Things">
Somewhere along the way
I got caught up in the race
I kept spinning and turning
Lost myself my hope my faith
We're always wanting more than what we have
And what I’ve learned is all I really need are...
The simple things
That come without a price
The simple things
Like happiness joy and love in my life
I've seen it all from so many sides
And I hope you would agree
The best things in life
Are the simple things
Hey everybody don't get me wrong 
You got to understand ambition and knowledge
Are the seeds of every woman and man
It's good to work... Work hard and prosper
As long as you take time to find...
The simple things
That come without a price
The simple things
Like happiness joy and love in my life
I've seen it all from so many sides
And I hope you would agree
That the best things in life
Are the simple things
This world moves so fast 
Sometimes you got to slow down, down, down 
To find out what it’s all about
We're always wanting more than what we have
What I’ve learned, is what I really need
The simple things
That come without a price
The simple things
Like happiness joy and love in my life
I've seen it all from so many sides
And I hope you would agree
The best things in life
Are the simple things.
