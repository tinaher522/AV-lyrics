<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="Love_Lives_On">
You touched my life
And turned my heart around
Seems when I found you
It was me I really found
You opened my eyes
And now my soul can see
Our moment may be over
But you're still here with me
'Cause love lives on
Beyond goodbye
The truth of us
Will never die
Our spirits will shine
Long after we're gone
And so our love lives on
There was so much
I didn't understand
And then you brought me here
Far from where
It all began
The change you made
In my life will never end
I look across the distance
I'll know I have a friend
'Cause love lives on
Beyond goodbye
The truth of us
Will never die
Our spirits will shine
Long after we're gone
And so our love lives on
I was travellin' in the dark
Never sure of what to do
I didn't know that I was lost
I found myself in you
Play something..
{instrumental break}
Love lives on
Beyond goodbye
The truth of us
Will never die
Our spirit will shine
Long after we're gone
And so our love lives on
And on
And so our love lives on
