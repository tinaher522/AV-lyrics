<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="The_Man_In_Me">
The man in me will do nearly any task
As for compensation, there's a little he will ask
Take a woman like you
To get through to the man in me.
Storm clouds are raging all around my door
I think to myself I might not take it anymore
Take a woman like your kind
To find the man in me.
But, oh what a wonderful feeling
Just to know that you are near
It sets my heart a-reeling
From my toes up to my ears.
The man in me will hide sometimes to keep from being seen
But that's just because he doesn't want to turn into some machine
Take a woman like you
To get through to the man in me.
