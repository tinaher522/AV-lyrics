<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="Shelter_Me">
This ain't no place for losers
Or the innocent of mind
It's a full time job
For anyone, to stay alive
The streets have shallow boundaries
For the war that's everyone
What a wasteland for
Broken dreams and hired guns
Shelter me, baby shelter me
When I'm sitting like I'm losing ground
Shelter me
I've gone to sleep
But when I open
The other goes my tears
In the darkness
I can I can hide my heart
But non of my fears
In the morning
Like a soldier
I look closed up battleground
Another day
Another part of me
And the world goes round
Shelter me
Won't you shelter me
When I'm sitting like I'm losing ground
Shelter me
Won't you shelter me
Oh, shelter me
When I lose control
Of my own home
Shelter me
Every time time I tumble down
I want to pack it up and leave this town
But when I finally get the nerve
Get cleared out of the shoes
I'm thanking you
I'm thanking you
Baby shelter me
Please shelter me
When I'm sitting down, and losing ground
Shelter me
Won't you shelter me
When I lose control
Am I alone
Shelter me
Won't you shelter me
Oh, shelter me
Baby please
Oh, shelter me
Stay back and shelter me
Come on and shelter me
When I lose control
Am I alone
Shelter me.
