<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="Shocked">
I had no warning, came this morning
Don't believe what I see
An empty bed and a note that read
You got new company
I was shocked when you left
Cut to the quick
Shocked when you said that it's over now
I still remember how you made that final vow
Now I was blown up, I picked my phone up
Operator said to me
Save your dime, there's nobody on the line
Call back later if you please
I was shocked when you left
Cut to the quick
Shocked when you said that it's over now
I still remember how you made that final vow
I've been told there's a thorn in every rose
I've been told there's a thorn in every rose
I sure found out, girl I found out
I remember when I met you
And you wouldn't let me see
What you wrote down now it's going round
Well the news came secretly
I was shocked when you left
Cut down to the quick
Shocked when you said that it's over now
I still remember how you made that final vow
Cause I was shocked.
