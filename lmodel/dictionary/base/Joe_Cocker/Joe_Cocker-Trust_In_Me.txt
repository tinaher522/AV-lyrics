<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="Trust_In_Me">
I see you turnin' the world in your hands
Just let it go
I've loved you better, than ever you wanted
Doesn't it show
You've been standin' at the window, day &amp; night
Lookin' at the rain
A simple conversation
A helpless situation
Please let me explain
Trust In Me, when you're all alone
Trust In Me, when you can't go on
If lovin' me is what you need
Trust In Me
Don't make it easy
I don't mind
There's somethin' I can do
And just try to see what you see
And I'll be there for you
You've been standin' at the window, day &amp; night
Tell me what you see
Sun in the daytime
Moon at night
That's how easy it should be
Trust In Me, when you're all alone
Trust In Me, when you can't go on
If lovin' me is what you need
Trust In Me
Trust In Me, when you can't go on
Trust In Me, when your strength is gone
If lovin' me is the power to heal
Trust In Me
If you need someone to hold ya
Call me, I'll be there
And if ever you're in trouble
And you need someone darlin'
Call me, call me, call me, call me
Move a little closer
A little closer to the bone
Move on in
Oh darlin', move on in
