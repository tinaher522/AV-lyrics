<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="Love_To_Lean_On">
You can make your point, I can disagree
But it will not change what you mean to me
Did it go too far, are we to the edge
Is there some way I can talk you down from the ledge
We can turn away from each other Or we can turn it back around
Maybe I’m wrong, maybe you’re right
Baby don't let this wounded pride drive a wedge between us
Wherever we go, whatever we do
I know we'll never make it through
If we try to stand alone we need love to lean on
We can make some changes, we can make this work
We can fix what's broken, we can heal the hurt
Take a new direction, now it's up to us
What we do in anger we can do in love
'Cause anything that's worth the having
Is worth fighting for
Maybe I’m wrong, maybe you’re right
Baby don't let this wounded pride drive a wedge between us
Wherever we go, whatever we do
I know we'll never make it through
If we try to stand alone
We need love to lean on, love to lean on
On and on and on, love to keep us strong.
