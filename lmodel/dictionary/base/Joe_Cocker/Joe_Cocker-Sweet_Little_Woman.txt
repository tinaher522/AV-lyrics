<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="Sweet_Little_Woman">
I never had no one, who would worry 'bout me
'Til the day, you came walkin' in my life
I never had no one, worry 'bout my needs
'Til you came and threw aside my shaddy clothes
I never realized, how beautiful love could be
'Til the day, you came walkin' in my home
Sweet little woman
You're turnin' me on
Sweet little woman
Rock me all the night long
Sweet little woman
Lead me into paradise
Sweet little woman
Keep turnin' me on
Sweet little woman
Rockin' me all the night long
Sweet little woman
Lead me into paradise
I never knew a life, wear such a happy face
Since you came, I've not shed a single tear
I never knew the world, ever could be so good
Since the day, all my clouds have disappeared
Sweet little woman
You're turnin' me on
Sweet little woman
Rockin' me all the night long
Sweet little woman
Why don't you lead me into paradise?
Sweet little woman
Keep turnin' me on
Sweet little woman
Rockin' me all the night long
Sweet little woman
Why don't ya lead me into paradise?
Hey, inside
Sweet little woman
You're drivin' me mad
Sweet little woman
Yeah, your lovin's so bad
Sweet little woman
Won't you lead me into paradise?
Sweet little woman
You're drivin' me mad
Sweet little woman
Tell your lovin's so bad
Sweet little woman
Lead me into paradise
