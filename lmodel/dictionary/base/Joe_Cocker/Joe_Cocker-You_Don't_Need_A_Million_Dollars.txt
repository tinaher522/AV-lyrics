<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="You_Don't_Need_A_Million_Dollars">
You don't need a million dollars 
To wake up naked in the morning 
And share a cup of coffee I smile at you smile back at me 
 
You don't need to be a movie star 
To see that night sky on your ceiling 
Throw me a can of paint and we'll paint some stars 
 
You don't need all of your problems 
To melt away like chocolate candies 
In your passenger seat on a hot August day 
 
You have everything 
You really need 
Right here, right now 
You have everything 
That you really need 
Right here, right now with me 
 
If you could see everyone's envy 
When you walk around in your cowboy boots 
That you found in a pile for a dollar at Wasteland 
 
If you could see what I see 
Like a crystal ball your blue eyes 
Tell me of our future and it's everything we dreamed 
 
You don't need all of your problems 
To melt away like chocolate candies 
In your passenger seat on a hot August day 
 
You have everything 
You really need 
Right here, right now 
You have everything 
That you really need 
Right here, right now 
With me 
 
You don't need a million dollars 
To throw your head back laughing 
To tell yourself it's gonna be fine 
Really fine 
Really no problems, amazing, every moment is the moment 
You can choose, how you feel 
You decide what is real and you can make 
The truest love you can star in your own movie 
You can write this song and sing it back to me 
You can see the world is nothing if not love 
You can see the world is nothing if not love 
You can see the world is nothing if not love 
Love, love, love 
 
You have everything 
That you really need 
Right here, right now 
You have everything 
That your really need 
Right here, right now with me 
Right here, right now with me.
