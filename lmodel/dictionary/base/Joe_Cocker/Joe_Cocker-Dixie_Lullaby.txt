<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="Dixie_Lullaby">
Gather 'round me people, got a song to sing
'Bout that sweet Magnolia Thyme
Black eyed Susan made some catfish stew
And papa brought some homemade wine
All the Southern children like to rock 'n' roll
The TV mamas tell you why
They got it on the boat from Africa
It's a Dixie Lullaby
And blind Willie Time, he had a dime shoe shine
Stand down on Beale Street
And Willie would stop and then he'll say, "Hello"
All the shoes he'd meet
"And why are you so happy?", said the clean white buck
"You got no reason to be happy, Mr Time"
Willie just smile and then he popped out rag
And sang a Dixie Lullaby
I'm a ta-ya-hippi, a ta-ya-hippi
Now how do you do?
But now you heard the story of my Southern home
With a honeysuckle wine
Anytime you think that you might come yourself
You oughta keep this thought in mind
All you easy riders better watch your step
If you're walkin' down below the line
That Louisiana man is gonna get you yet
With his Dixie Lullaby, oh, it's a Dixie Lullaby
Yeah, it's a Dixie Lullaby
