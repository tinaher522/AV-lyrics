<song artist="Joe_Cocker" title="Jamaica_Say_You_Will">
Jamaica was the lovely one, I played her well
As we lay in the tall grass where the shadows fell
Hiding from the children so they wouldn't tell
We would stay there 'till her sister rang the evening bell
The daughter of a captain on the rolling seas
She would stare across the water from the trees
Last time he was home he held her on his knees
And said the next time they would sail away just where they pleased
Jamaica, say you will
Help me find a way to fill these empty hours
Say you will come again tomorrow
Jamaica was the lovely one, I loved her true
She was a comfort and a mercy through and through
Hiding from this world together, next thing I knew
We had brought her things down to the bay, yeah, what could I do
Jamaica, say you will
Help me find a way to fill these lifeless sails
Say you will help my ship to find the sea, whoa
Jamaica, say you will
Help me find a way to fill these lifeless sails
And we will sail until our waters have run dry
Jamaica, say you will
Help me find a way to fill these lifeless sails
And then we'll sail until our waters have run dry
Jamaica, say you
