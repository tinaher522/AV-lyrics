<song artist="Lukas_Graham" title="Strip_No_More">
I met this girl, I think she likes me
I must admit I like her too
She said she'd be working tonight
I said cool I'll drop by and she looked at me, smiled, and said: That's great, baby
When I showed up, I was confused
I said: Hey, where's that girl I talked to yesterday?
Now I said: Hey, where is Destiny, is that her name?
I can't believe she would leave
Without me, Destiny
How come you don't strip no more?
Uh-uh-uh uhhhh
How come you don't strip no more?
Uh-uh-uh uhhhhh
I met your friends, I think they like me
(They like me) Ooh!
But they don't do it like you do
They told me you were graduated, why didn't you say it?
That's so cool
I'm just so proud you made it through
But I said: Hey, where's that girl I talked to yesterday?
Now I said: Hey, where is Destiny, is that her name?
I can't believe she would leave
Without me, Destiny
How come you don't strip no more?
Uh-uh-uh uhhhhh
How come you don't strip no more?
Uh-uh-uh uhhhhh
I was at table three, b.y.o.b. and
Destiny sat next to me
She asked me if I liked her dance
I told her "I'm your biggest fan"
Then she took me by the hand, and turned this boy into a man
Inside a private room, I hope you understand
I was like uh uh (uh uh)
She made me go wee hee (wee hee)
She made me go uh uh uuuh (uh uh uuuh)
Now I'm not mad that you don't want me
I'm just stuck here wondering
I wanna know
How come you don't strip no more?
Uh-uh-uh uhhhhh
How come you don't strip no more?
Uh-uh-uh uhhhhh
How come you don't strip no more?
Uh-uh-uh uhhhhh
How come you don't strip no more?
Uh-uh-uh uhhhhh
Why don't you strip no more, don't strip no more
Baby don't strip no more, don't strip no more
Don't strip no more, baby don't strip no more
Don't strip no more baby...
How come you don't strip no more?
