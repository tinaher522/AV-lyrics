<song artist="Lukas_Graham" title="Funeral">
When it's my time, I know you'll tailor a new suit for me
And buy a new tie, so I'll look this good
Boy, you were right
You said only them good ones die young
Never in my life did I look this good
Everyone welcome to my funeral
Everyone I know better be wasted
You know I would pour one up
Cause the way I lived, it was amazing
All of my friends are in the room
Party for me - I'd party too
You're all on my tap
Bartenders pour out the whiskeys on me
And don't be so sad
Cause I lived this good
We were closer
Now it's over
Oh it doesn't mean it's closure
I see you and I love you
I'll be watching out above you
Everyone welcome to my funeral
Everyone I know better be wasted
You know I would pour one up
Cause the way I lived, it was amazing
All of my friends are in the room
Party for me - I'd party too
All of my friends are in the room
Party for me - I'd party too
Everyone welcome to my funeral
Everyone I know better be wasted
You know I would pour one up
Cause the way I lived, it was amazing
Welcome to my funeral
Everyone I know better be wasted
You know I would pour one up
Cause the way I lived, it was amazing
Welcome to my funeral
Everyone I know better be wasted
You know I would pour one up
Cause the way I lived, it was amazing
So welcome to my funeral
Welcome to my funeral
