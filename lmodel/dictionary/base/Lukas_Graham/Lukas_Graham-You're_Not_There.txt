<song artist="Lukas_Graham" title="You're_Not_There">
I only got you in my stories
And you know I tell them right
And remember you and I, when I'm awake at night
So give it up for fallen glory
I never got to say goodbye
I wish I could ask for just a bit more time
Every step I take, you used to lead the way
Now I'm terrified to face it on my own
You're not there
To celebrate the man that you made
You're not there
To share in my success and mistakes
Is it fair?
You'll never know the person I'll be
You're not there
With me
Though I know that you're not there
I still write you all these songs
It's like, you still got the right to know what's going on
As i struggle to remember how you used to look and sound
Sometimes i still think i can spot you in the crowd
Every step I take, you used to lead the way
Now I'm terrified to face it on my own
You're not there
To celebrate the man that you made
You're not there
To share in my my success and mistakes
Is it fair?
You'll never know the person I'll be
You're not there
With me
Time can heal your wounds if
You're strong and standing tall
I've been doing all of that, it didn't help at all
They say "You'll grow older, and it'll get better still"
Yes, I will, but no it won't
They don't get it, cause
You're not there
To celebrate the man that you made
You're not there
To share in my my success and mistakes
Is it fair?
You'll never know the person I'll be
You're not there
With me
