We started with a clean slate
Came to stake our claim
Looking for a good time
On the streets that reek of fame
Where everybody looks good
They're better dressed than me
The waitress brings us cold beers
But she wants to see ID
I swear she saw me coming
Well maybe in an hour or two
She said: "Boy do you like downtown?"
What else was I to do?
You know I tipped her, and
Slipped, slipped her the number
I said I just got into town and I wanna
Hang out and light up some marijuana
You wanna? You wanna? You?
She said when I get off it's playtime
I'll show you where to go on late nights
And later I'll give you the bed ride
And maybe I can make you beg right
She said when I get off it's playtime
I'll show you where to go on late nights
And later I'll give you the bed ride
Oh baby I'm gon' make you beg right
She took me to a dive bar
The kind that never close
The cheapest drink was Bourbon shots
So we loaded up on those
Her friend was serving all night
I liked her serving slow
When locking up she told me: "sit"
While she told the rest to go
So I tipped her and
Slipped, slipped her the number
I said I just got into town and I wanna
Hang out and light up some marijuana
You wanna? You wanna? You?
She said when I get off it's playtime
I'll show you where to go on late nights
And later I'll give you the bed ride
And maybe I can make you beg right
She said when I get off it's playtime
I'll show you where to go on late nights
And later I'll give you the bed ride
Oh baby I'm gon' make you beg right
If a girl has got to go
And work all day (work all day)
I'm gonna do my best to help her find a little time to play
She said when I get off it's playtime
I'll show you where to go on late nights
And later I'll give you the bed ride
And maybe I can make you beg right
She said when I get off it's playtime
I'll show you where to go on late nights
And later I'll give you the bed ride
Oh baby I'm gon' make you beg right
