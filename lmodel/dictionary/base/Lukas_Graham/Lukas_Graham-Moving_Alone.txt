<song artist="Lukas_Graham" title="Moving_Alone">
I was still in my teens
The biggest man in my life went and shattered my dreams
How could you do it to mom
I swore back then I wouldn't be like you
And it hurt like hell you didn't tell us the truth
How could you do it to mom
I don't even know if you know that you hurt us
From all I understand it seems like you just don't care
Now I'm walking alone with my burden
A burden to bear that can never belong to me
I'm just a chip off the block never too far from you
Tell me daddy what to do
Tell me is it destiny, to start fooling around and keep fooling around
Did you know that I knew, knew about her and you
And I felt so confused, I even considered
To tell mommy the truth
Tell mommy the truth
Tell mommy the truth
Tell mommy the truth
Tell mommy the truth
But I'm just like him
Now the circle starts over starts over again
I realize, the story's not over at all
I thought the cheating would have ended with him
But I'm cheating, now I'm cheating on my own girlfriend
Truth be told I guess she wasn't special at all
She doesn't even know if I know that I hurt her
From all she understands it seems like I just don't care
Now I'm walking alone with my burden
A burden I bear now because it belongs to me
I'm just a chip off the block I'm never too far from you
Tell me daddy what to do
Tell me is it destiny, to start fooling around and keep fooling around
Did you know that I knew, knew about her and you
And I felt so confused, I even considered
To tell mommy the truth
Tell mommy the truth
Tell mommy the truth
Tell mommy the truth
Tell mommy the truth
Everybody's walking alone
Everybody's walking alone
Everybody's walking alone
I said
Everybody's walking alone
Everybody's walking alone
I know that everybody's walking alone
I'm just a chip off the block I'm never too far from you
Tell me daddy what to do
Tell me is it destiny, to start fooling around and keep fooling around
Did you know that I knew, knew about her and you
And I felt so confused, I even considered
To tell mommy the truth
Tell mommy the truth
Tell mommy the truth
Tell mommy the truth
Tell mommy the truth
