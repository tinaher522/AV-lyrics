<song artist="Lukas_Graham" title="Ordinary_Things">
You, thought that I could change
But I'm all the same, girl I'm all the same
You, thought that you could work me out
It's just that all these ordinary things, ordinary things
Seemed to hunt you, making me wanna dump you
Just that all these ordinary things, ordinary things
Seems a lot, why don't we just break it up, hey
You had me in your hand, and I don't understand
Why you tripping cause I ain't slipping
Baby I'm your man
You text excessively, you can't leave me be
I don't ask you, what you're up to
But you keep calling, me
You have got to stop these things
I need someone with confidence
Confidence ain't buying rings
And ask me where I drink my drinks
I don't need you
To tell me what to do
It's all up in your head
And I'm just sorry that
These ordinary things, ordinary things
Seemed to hunt you, making me wanna dump you
Just that all these ordinary things, ordinary things
Seems a lot, why don't we just break it up, hey
We've got to end this show, I've got to let you go
I can't stand it, you're too demanding
Such a jealous ho'
You put it in my head, like a bullet made of lead
Baby stop it you've got to drop it there
You should know what happens
When you say them things you say
Your value falls
Girl it falls
Don't blame me for shit I didn't do
Maybe I should have gone out cheating on you
You have got to stop these things
I need someone with confidence
Confidence ain't buying rings
And ask me where I drink my drinks
I don't need you
To tell me what to do
It's all up in your head
And I ain't sorry that them ordinary things, them ordinary things
Used to hunt you, cause baby now I dumped you
And all them ordinary things , them ordinary things
Were too much, cause now I broke it up
