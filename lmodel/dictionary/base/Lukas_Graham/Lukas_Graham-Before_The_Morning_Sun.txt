<song artist="Lukas_Graham" title="Before_The_Morning_Sun">
Sitting awake before the morning sun
Only cause I couldn't fall asleep while the night was young
I'm restless can't call myself stressless
These past weeks have left me breathless and senseless
My brother from another mother lost a brother
My father lost his father I lost a friend
Something that I couldn't comprehend
We'll never see these men again
Once upon a time life was so innocent
We're past the past
The now is now
The future will be here in a minute
But I don't care what's going down
Any how
I miss the time with the many smiles
When we could always stretch it for a little while
Now you're gone and it feels like I'm alone
Oh God damn it how I miss you so
Sometimes it will feel time can stop
Sometimes I feel like giving up
But then I hear a voice inside of me saying
Better die with your chin up than living on your knees
Daydreaming is okay sometimes
But to face the facts really hurts
And when you finally feel the weight of your burden
Get up again if you kiss the dirt
I'd rather live one day as a lion
Than live a hundred years as a sheep
I'd rather reign in hell than serve in heaven
Live my dreams out in reality and not in my sleep
The past is gone
The now is now
The future will be here in a minute
But I don't care what's going down
What's going down
People tell me pick yourself up off the road
Can't I just stay and get squashed like a little toad
They'll say you have a burden to carry
Somewhere along the line there's a girl to marry
But don't worry I'll get up
I won't give it up even if it won't stop
Hurting in my heart now that we're apart
My chronic pain is about to start will it be hard
I'd rather live one day as a lion
Than live a hundred years as a sheep
I'd rather reign in hell than serve in heaven
Live my dreams out in reality and not in my sleep
