<song artist="Lukas_Graham" title="Daddy,_Now_That_You're_Gone_(Ain't_No_Love)">
Ain't no love
In the heart of the city
Daddy, there ain't no love
In the heart of town
Oh Daddy there ain't no love
In the show of them pity
Daddy there ain't no love
Cause you're ain't around
When you were mine
I was feeling so good
Cause you loved this neighborhood
Oh daddy now that you're gone
You know the sun don't shine
From the city's home to the county line
That's why I say that there ain't no love
In the heart of the city!
Daddy there ain't no love
In the heart of town
No Daddy, ain't no love
In the show(meant) of the pity
Daddy there ain't no love
Cause you ain't around
Every place where I go
And I would seem so strange
Without you there
Things have changed
Oh Daddy now that you're gone
You know the sun don't shine
From the city, ohhh, to the county line
That's why I say there ain't no love
In the heart of the city
Daddy there ain't no love
In the heart of town
No daddy ain't no love
In the show(meant) of the pity
Daddy there ain't no love
Cause you ain't around
Oh Daddy, now that you're gone
You know the sun don't shine
From the city, ohhh, to the county line
Oh Daddy now that you're gone
You know the sun don't shine
From the city - to the county line
That's why I say:
There ain't no love
Ain't no love
Ain't no love
Ain't no love
Ain't no love
