<song artist="Lukas_Graham" title="Apologize">
Baby got me smiling, forgetting all her flaws
My angel lost her halo, so I put her next to God
I called her my angel gave her all my time
And she was the kind of woman
Who could give me peace of mind
But now it's over she betrayed me
(How does the defendant plead?)
I'm not guilty, there's nothing I did wrong
What I did was all her fault
And I won't apologize
I won't apologize, for what she made me do
I won't apologize to you
(Sit down young man or I will hold you in contempt of this court!)
I took her for a picnic
Asked her is it true
She said yes and I'm sorry
I never meant to hurt you
She began to worry
I said I'm still in love
And you can't keep on living
If you don't think I'm enough
And now it's over she betrayed me
(How does the defendant plead?)
I'm not guilty, there's nothing I did wrong
What I did was all her fault
And I won't apologize
I won't apologize, for what she made me do
I won't apologize to you
(I'm dismissing this case on the grounds of insubstantial evidence!)
Policeman got me smiling
He thinks I'll go to jail
But I got proper lawyers
So I told him go to hell
The judge is asking questions
I don't know what to say
Only that she slept around
And that she deserved to pay
And I won't apologize
I won't apologize
There's nothing I did wrong
What I did was all her fault
And I won't apologize
I won't apologize, for what she made me do
I won't apologize to you
