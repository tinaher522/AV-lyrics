<song artist="Lukas_Graham" title="Don't_You_Worry_'Bout_Me">
Hey my friend, how you've been?
What are you going through?
What is this trouble, that's troubling you?
He tried to turn the thing around
And asked me how I've been
I said, I really don't know where to begin
I saw my life come crashing down
I crawled, I walked, I'm flying now
I found my strength on my knees
Don't you worry 'bout me
Don't you worry 'bout me
Don't you worry 'bout me
Don't you worry 'bout me
A lot of people told me
When daddy passed away
Go take some time off
But I've got no time to waste
Don't you have a dream too
Some goals you've got to make
You may feel small sometimes
It don't mean you can't be great
I saw my life come crashing down
I crawled, I walked, I'm flying now
I found my strength on my knees
So, don't you worry 'bout me
Don't you worry 'bout me
Don't you worry, worry, worry
Don't you worry 'bout me
Don't you worry 'bout me
Sometimes your life can bring you down
Sometimes you run for miles and miles
Sometimes you scream without hope
Now once you feel you hit the ground
Then victory comes back around
And you'll be proud to let them know
Don't worry 'bout me
Don't you worry 'bout me
Don't you worry 'bout me
Don't you worry 'bout me
Don't you worry 'bout me
Oh please
Don't you worry, worry, worry, worry
No, don't you, don't you, worry 'bout me
Don't you worry 'bout me
Don't you worry 'bout me
