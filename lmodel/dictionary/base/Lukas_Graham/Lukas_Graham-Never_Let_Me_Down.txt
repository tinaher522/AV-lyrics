<song artist="Lukas_Graham" title="Never_Let_Me_Down">
There's just something about her
She got me working harder
She is always on my mind
Oh oh oh I tell ya
She's got something that's better
It holds my world together
When she's a with me I'm alright
And everywhere I go empty handed
Feeling we've been parted for so long
That's why I keep you right here in my palm
You never let me, down
Swear you're a blessing, oh
Ain't you the best thing, wow
Love everlasting
Never get me wrong
Oh you let me be
You gotta love me
Come on
Come on
Back at the bar I was having my drink
Talking to my lady never needed a shrink
Somebody sent me a smile then she threw me a wink
She asked are you single I said what do you think
Girl everywhere I go empty handed
Feeling we've been parted for so long
That's why I keep you right here on my arm
You never let me, down
Swear you're a blessing, oh
Ain't you the best thing, wow
Love everlasting
Never get me wrong
Oh you let me be
You gotta love me
Come on
Come on
I like to mix it, girl I'd like to twist it with you
I like to shake it girl I think I'll make it with you
I like to mix it, girl I'd like to twist it with you, you, you
You never let me, down
Swear you're a blessing, oh
Ain't you the best thing, wow
Love everlasting
Never get me wrong
Oh you let me be
You gotta love me
Come on
Come on
