<song artist="Lukas_Graham" title="What_Happened_To_Perfect">
I can see it in your eyes as I am stumbling home
You living with the man that you no longer know
You forgot to smile as I catch you by
Now we sitting down for dinner we got nothing to say
It's like I am watching you slowly slipping away
From me from me
Remember when I used to make you laugh
And every joke was better than the last
Tell me how to bring you back to this
Maybe I just need to reminisce and work it out
What happened to perfect
What happened to us
We used to be worth it
We never gave up
It wasn't on purpose
But it hurts like it was
Nobody deserves this
What happened to perfect
If you left me baby where would you go
I can't imagine you ever being alone
I am a gentleness man but I try to understand
So many things to say I don't know where to start
I can't pick up the pieces of a crumbling heart
So true so true
Remember when I used to make you laugh
And every joke was better than the last
Tell me how to bring you back to this
Maybe I just need to reminisce and work it out
What happened to perfect
What happened to us
We used to be worth it
We never gave up
It wasn't on purpose
But it hurts like it was
Nobody deserves this
What happened to perfect
What happened to perfect
What's under the surface
It used to be love
Would you call if you heard this
Would you know it was us
It wasn't on purpose
But it hurts like it was
Nobody deserves this
What happened to perfect
Nobody deserves this
I can see it in your eyes as I am stumbling home
You living with a man you no longer know
You forgot to smile
