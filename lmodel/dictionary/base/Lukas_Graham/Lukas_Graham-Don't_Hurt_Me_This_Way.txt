Sunday morning
Trying to clear my head
I don't remember what I did
I can't remember shit
But I feel good
You know you've got to leave
But now you want me, you really want me
Now you're on your knees
Begging please, oh
And acting kind of strange
Telling me how much you want me
But this can never change
I used to want you
Now it's not the same
What you give is what you get
I said no but you're still begging
Baby don't hurt me don't hurt me this way
I thought we agreed that we both felt the same
Baby don't hurt me, it's not okay
You said
I know I told you
Girl there's no excuse
We both helped to draw the line
You had the chance to choose
Why you messing
Messing with my head
Making me feel guilty
When you know I'm innocent
Baby please oh
You were just a fling
I never would have started
If I knew how it would end
All I'm asking
Is take this pain away
What you give is what you get
I said no but you're still begging
Baby don't hurt me don't hurt me this way
I thought we agreed that we both felt the same
Baby don't hurt me, it's not okay
You said
You said it meant nothing to you
That it was alright with you
Don't ask me what I can't do
So why you being unfair?!
So why you being so cruel?!
So why you being this mean?!
What have I ever done to you?
But you're still begging
Baby don't hurt me don't hurt me this way
I'm sorry I can't take your pain away
So baby don't hurt me it's not ok
You said
So baby don't hurt me don't hurt me this way
I thought we agreed that we both felt the same
So baby don't hurt me, it's not okay
You said
