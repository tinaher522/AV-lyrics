<song artist="Lukas_Graham" title="Red_Wine">
Why don't you
Come over and drink a glass of red wine
Why don't you
Come over and get to know me
Why don't you, come sit in the candlelight
I know you got things to show me
Why don't you, come drink a glass of red wine
I'll show you things of mine
I have a dinner invitation for two
All included me and you
A bit of porch, summer afternoon
We'll be enjoying wine and stars soon
Night sky I'm, nice high high
Good company, such a fly vibe
It's you the weed the wine and me
Aren't you glad you came over this evening
Why don't you
Come over and drink a glass of red wine
Why don't you
Come over and get to know me
Why don't you, come sit in the candlelight
I know you got things to show me
Why don't you, come drink a glass of red wine
I'll show you things of mine
I let the wine drop into your glass
You feel that warm sensation in your face
You wanna feel, you wanna laugh
It will all be over so fast
I ask shall we, she says maybe
Turn my back, and she says take me
She truly is one remarkable lady
I wonder, of what is she created
Why don't you
Come over and drink a glass of red wine
Why don't you
Come over and get to know me
Why don't you, come sit in the candlelight
I know you got things to show me
Why don't you, come drink a glass of red wine
I'll show you things of mine
I follow you, your glass and your ass
Into the room so fast
I grab the bottle, and we snuggle
Strip each other at last
Steaming hot, believe it or not
We both gave it all we got, and when we're done
We'll smoke another one drink some more
Then an encore and an encore, encore
