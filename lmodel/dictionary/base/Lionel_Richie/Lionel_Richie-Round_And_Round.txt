<song artist="Lionel_Richie" title="Round_And_Round">
Tryin' to figure out just where you are
You tried to play the game of love, didn't get too far
You told yourself you'd be nobody's fool
You want a good reason why love is so cruel, baby
Oh, oh, round and round
Love's got you goin'
It's turnin' you upside down
You play the game, it's so insane
Like lost and found
Love's got you spinnin' all around, baby
Are you thinkin' love has passed you by, oh
Do you feel so alone, sometimes you just sit and cry
Tryin' to think if love was meant for you
Oh, you're startin' to wonder what you're gonna do, baby
Oh, oh, round and round
Love's got you goin'
It's turnin' you upside down
You play the game, it's so insane
Like lost and found
Love's got you spinnin' all around, baby
Oh, oh, I know you need a place to be
You want someone who cares and shares
And loves you so
I want to know there's something you can do, oh
You need to realize all things can come to you
Just believe it's all about your heart, baby
And you're gonna make it when you're ready to start, oh
No need to go round and round
Love's got you goin'
It's turnin' you upside down
You play the game, it's so insane
Called lost and found
Love's got you spinnin' all around, baby
Whoa, whoa, round and round
Love's got you goin'
It's turnin' you upside down
You play the game, it's so insane
Called lost and found
Love's got you spinnin' all around, baby
The world is all out there for you
It all depends on what you do
Your life's too short for wastin' time
So follow your heart and make up your mind
Round and round
Love's got you goin'
It's turnin' you upside down
You play the game, it's so insane
Called lost and found
Love's got you spinnin' all around, baby
