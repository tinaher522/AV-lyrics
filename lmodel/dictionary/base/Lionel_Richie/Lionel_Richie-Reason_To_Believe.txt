<song artist="Lionel_Richie" title="Reason_To_Believe">
Everybody's talking loud 
Tryin' to get me to join the crowd 
But I can't hear what they're talking about 
Cause they ain't sayin' nothin' 
They say come follow me 
What I'm telling you will set you free 
All you gotta do is act like me 
But I can't feel nothin' 
I just want somebody 
To laugh out loud 
I just want somebody 
To make me smile 
Whoah I'm 
I'm trying to finda reason to believe
I'm trying to finda reason to believe
(Wait a minute) I just can't tell what's right or wrong 
And I'm not sure where I belong 
And where is that simple song I remember 
THey say everything's in black and white 
And the sun shines at twelve at night 
And to praise God you gotta fight 
It's crazy, crazy 
I just want somebody 
To laugh out loud 
I just want somebody 
To make me smile 
Whoah cause I'm 
I'm trying to finda reason to believe
I'm trying to finda reason to believe
Don't wanna live 
Don't wanna lie to myself anymore 
Don't wanna try to understand 
THe pain I see through my eyes 
Let me laugh 
Just let me cry 
Just let me see right from wrong 
Just let me love 
Let me feel 
Cause I want in my life all the things that's real 
Cause I 
I'm trying to finda reason to believe
I'm trying to finda reason to believe
I'm trying to finda reason to believe
I'm trying to finda reason to believe
I'm trying to finda reason to believe
I'm trying to finda reason to believe
