<song artist="Lionel_Richie" title="I_Wanna_Take_You_Down">
I wanna take you down
I wanna take you down
I wanna take you down
I wanna take you down
I wanna take you down
I wanna take you down
I wanna take you down
I wanna take you down
I wanna take you down
Moods fight for love
And you're the one
Let's descend for a while
Let's go down
Let's go deep undercover
Get into each other
I'll let you choose the style
Any style
Take you down
I wanna take you down
Wanna love you baby
Like nobody else loved before
Wanna take you down
Gonna love you baby love you
I wanna take you down
I wanna take you down
I wanna take you down
I wanna take you down
I wanna take you down
I wanna take you down
I wanna take you down
I wanna take you down
I wanna take you down
Oh don't move fast
Keep it slow baby
Make it last
Oh cause I feel so aroused, so aroused
Take you down, take you down
I wanna take you down
Wanna love you baby
Like nobody else loved before
Wanna take you down
Gonna love you baby love you
I wanna take you down
I wanna take you down
I wanna take you down
I wanna take you down
I wanna take you down
I wanna take you down
I wanna take you down
I wanna take you down
I wanna take you down
Get down, get down
My love
Don't you know, oh I'm ready
I wanna take you down
Wanna love you baby
Like nobody else loved before
Wanna take you down
Gonna love you baby love you
