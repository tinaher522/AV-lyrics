<song artist="Lionel_Richie" title="Time_Of_Our_Life">
Hey, I can see that smile on your face
Tonight, memories will never erase
And I feel like our time has come
Our hearts are beating wild as one
True love, I know is hard to find
But you tonight, You're mine
Didn't we have the time of our life tonight
Didn't we have the time of our life tonight
Hey, I hope you feel the same way I feel
Cause tonight the moon, the stars,
This moment is so real, To us we had everything
Our hearts have a song to sing
We now know that dreams come true
Cause now there's me and you
Didn't we have the time of our life tonight
Didn't we have the time of our life tonight
Didn't we have the time of our life tonight
Didn't we have the time of our life tonight
Didn't we dance the night away
What can I say to you, You make life a holiday
Let's go and play, Let's go and play
Didn't we have the time of our life tonight
Didn't we have the time of our life tonight
Didn't we have the time of our life tonight
Didn't we have the time of our life tonight
Come on and sing the song
Come on and sing along
