<song artist="Lionel_Richie" title="Goodbye">
I wanted you for life,
you and me in the wind.
I never thought there'd come a time,
that our story would end.
It's hard to understand,
but I guess I'll have to try.
It's not easy,
to say goodbye.
For all the joy we shared,
all that time we had to spend.
Now if I had one wish,
I'd want forever back again.
To look into your eyes,
and hold you when you cry.
It's not easy,
to say goodbye.
I can remember all those great times we had.
There were so many memories, some good, some bad.
Yes, and through it all, those memories will last forever.
There's peace in where you are,
maybe all I need to know.
And if I listen to my heart,
I'll hear your laughter once more.
And so I've got to say,
I'm just glad you came my way.
It's not easy,
to say goodbye.
Goodbye.
