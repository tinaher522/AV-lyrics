<song artist="Lionel_Richie" title="Angel">
I just want to tell you all the things you are
And all the things you mean to me
When I find myself in need and there's no place to go
When I feel the loneliness inside my heart
You're the answer to my prayers
And you're with me everywhere
You're my angel
Miracle
You're all I need tonight
Give me shelter from the rain
You breathe life in me again
You're my angel
Miracle
You're all I need to know
Tonight
Life is just a moment
We're blowing in the wind
We're trying to find a friend
And only time can tell us
If win or if we lose
And who will stand beside us
When there's darkness all around me
You're the light I see
When I need someone to ease my troubled mind
You're the answer to my prayers
And you're with me everywhere
You're my angel
Miracle
You're all I need tonight
Give me shelter from the rain
You breathe life in me again
You're my angel
Miracle
You're all I need to know
Tonight
Oh...
You're all I need tonight
All I need tonight
All I need tonight
You're my angel
You're the answer to my prayers
And you're with me everywhere
You're my angel
Miracle
You're all I need tonight
Give me shelter from the rain
You breathe life in me again
You're my angel
My miracle
You're all I need to know
Tonight
All I need tonight
All I need tonight
All I need to know
My Angel
My Angel...
