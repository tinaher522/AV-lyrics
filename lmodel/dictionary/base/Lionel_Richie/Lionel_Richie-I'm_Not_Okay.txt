<song artist="Lionel_Richie" title="I'm_Not_Okay">
I've seen what you're facing
Please don't be alarmed
If you need me just call me
You're never alone
Hey, I'm barely sleepin
I'm barely eatin
Until the rain turns into change
My heart's your heart
My love's your love
And I am not okay
Unless you're okay
And my mind is your mind
And my soul is your soul
And I'm not okay
Unless you're okay
Whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh, oh yeah
Whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh, oh yeah
I'm headed wherever you're going
And I mean that from my heart
In the end you'll see that I've been there from the start
I'm not walkin away
Not talkin just to say
Your pain's my pain
And, uh, your gain's my gain
I wanna be right here
To make sure your tears don't form a river
I'm gonna be right here
Until you're vision becomes clearer
I ain't sleepin
I'm not eatin
Until the rain turns into change
