<song artist="Lionel_Richie" title="Love,_Oh_Love">
Show the world and all it's people,
All the wonders love can bring,
Give us strength and understanding, 
Give us all one song to sing,
Let the music play,
Play it loud and make it clear,
It's time to stand up,
To a new world that is now so near,
From the bottom to the top,
To the leaders of the land,
We all have one heart,
Everyone of us must lend a hand,
And let there be joy in the world,
Let there be,
And let there be no sorrow,
Let there be,
And let there be peace on earth,
Let there be,
For all the world we've got to see the love,
Oh love, what a blessed thing,
Oh yeah, 
Say it loud,
Make it clear, today,
All the walls are falling down,
No more children off to war,
If we search in our hearts,
All the suffering will be no more,
And let there be joy in the world,
Let there be,
And let there be no sorrow,
Oh, Let there be,
And let there be peace on earth,
Let there be,
For all God's children let them see the love,
Oh love, what a blessed thing,
Oh yeah,
Say it loud,
Make it clear, today,
And freedom no more lies,
We can save this world if we try,
One world I know we can make it,
'Cos its only in your heart,
Yes its only in your dreams,
We can climb the highest mountains,
We can make the whole world see,
Oh yeah, 
Love, oh love, what a blessed thing,
Oh yeah, 
Say it loud, say it loud,
Make it clear, today, 
Love, oh love, what a blessed thing,
Oh yeah, 
Say it loud, 
Make it clear, today, 
Love, oh love, what a blessed thing,
Oh yeah, 
Say it loud, 
Make it clear, today.
