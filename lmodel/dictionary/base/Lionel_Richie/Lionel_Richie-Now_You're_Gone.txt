<song artist="Lionel_Richie" title="Now_You're_Gone">
All alone on a mystic night
There you stood in the pale moonlight
I wanted to know you
You were standing here and now you're gone
You could just feel the passion all in the air
I wanted to touch you but I would not dare
I had to know you
You were standing here and now you're gone
Oh, Oh, Oh
You are standing here and now you're gone
You started to dance, so slow, so smooth
Your body seduced me on your every mode
Just had to know you
You were standing here and now you're gone
Then you stopped, he called out to you
You turned and left me, there was nothing I could do
I wanted to know you
You were standing here and now you're gone
Oh, Oh, Oh
You were standing here and now you're gone
