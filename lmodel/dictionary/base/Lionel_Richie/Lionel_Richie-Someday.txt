<song artist="Lionel_Richie" title="Someday">
Someday
Someday
When I fell for you
There was no doubt about it
You were the best thing
In my life to come along
You and me
We said we will last forever
Something so right
You just had to make so wrong
Someday, baby
You're gonna miss my love
Someday
You're gonna miss my love
You played around
You didn't care about my feelings
You messed around
Tryin' to play me like a fool
How could you look at my face
And tell me that you love me
How could you treat me so cold
How could you be so cruel
I tried to give you something
That everybody's out here looking for
You just couldn't see the good things
That I had to give
Now it's for me to help you out the door
Someday, someday, baby
You're gonna miss, you're gonna miss
You're gonna miss my love
Someday, someday, baby
You're gonna miss my love
Tried to give you something
That everybody's out here looking for
You just couldn't see a good thing
When I had to give to you, baby
Now it's time for me to help you out the door
Someday, someday, baby
You're gonna miss, you're gonna miss
You're gonna miss my love
Someday, I'm sure you will
You're gonna miss my love
(Someday)
Why did you have to do me wrong
All you did was just string my heart along
Did you care about the pain that I feel inside
You lied, you lied
(Someday)
Oh, you lied to me, baby
I can't believe it, I can't conceive it
But right now I've just got to relieve it
(Someday)
Oh yeah, I've got to help you out the door, baby
Walking out the door
(Someday)
Oh babe
You're gonna miss, you're gonna miss my loving
(Someday)
I'm sure you will, sure you will
You're gonna miss my, you're gonna miss
You're gonna miss my love
(Someday)
