<song artist="Lionel_Richie" title="Brick_House">
She's a brick, house
Mighty mighty, just lettin' it all hang out
She's a brick, house
The lady's stacked and that's a fact, 
Ain't holding nothing back. 
She's a brick, house
She's the one, the only one, 
Who's built like a amazon 
We're together everybody knows, 
And here's how the story goes. 
She knows she got everything
A woman needs to get a man, yeah. 
How can she use, the things she use
36-24-36, what a winning hand! 
She's a brick, house
Mighty mighty, just lettin' it all hang out
She's a brick, house
The lady's stacked and that's a fact, 
Ain't holding nothing back.
The clothes she wears, the sexy ways, 
Make an old man wish for younger days
She knows she's built and knows how to please
Sure enough to knock a man to his knees
She's a brick, house
Mighty mighty, just lettin' it all hang out
She's a brick, house
The lady's stacked and that's a fact, 
Ain't holding nothing back.
Shake it down, shake it down now 
Shake it down, shake it down now
