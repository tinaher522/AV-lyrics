<song artist="Lionel_Richie" title="I_Still_Believe">
I still believe in you and me
Still believe the sun will shine on me
I still believe there's a reason, there's a meaning to why we're here
There is a place where we can go to where we don't have to live in fear
They're trying to tell me that the moon is in the ocean
And i'm just dreaming my life away
I still believe in you and me
Still believe the sun will shine on me
I still believe true love is the answer, Don't turn away
Cos I believe in love that's the only way
I believe in every moment, every heartbeat that we're here
And we're a part of each other and forever it seems so clear
I don't believe that i'm just walking in the darkness
Or that I'm lost without a prayer
I still believe in you and me
Still believe the sun will shine on me
Oh now is the answer and oh it's right here
And I know we've got to remember it's only together for now and forever
I still believe in you and me
Still believe the sun will shine on me
I still believe true love is the answer
Don't turn away, Cos I believe in love
Cos i believe in love,  Cos i believe in love and that's the only way
