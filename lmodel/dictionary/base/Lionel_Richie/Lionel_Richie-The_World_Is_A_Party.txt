<song artist="Lionel_Richie" title="The_World_Is_A_Party">
The world is a party (x4)
As I watch the world as it keeps spinning round
And try to figure out what's going down
With so much joy and love in demand
Why can't we get it right and understand
Chorus: The world is a party (x4)
Look at the faces out there everywhere
There is a happiness we all can share
Walk in the sunshine come out the rain
It's time to face the truth that we're all the same
Chorus: The world is a party (x4)
It's so right it can't be wrong
All you got to do is come along
It's our time to celebrate
Tonight it's gonna be that way
Chorus: The world is a party (x4)
It's so right it can't be wrong
All you got to do is come along
It's our time to celebrate
Tonight it's gonna be that way
The world is a party, The world is a party...
