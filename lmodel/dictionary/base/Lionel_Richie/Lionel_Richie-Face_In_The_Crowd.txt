<song artist="Lionel_Richie" title="Face_In_The_Crowd">
I'm just a face in the crowd
You probably don't know me
As I don't stand out
And I'm sure your heart doesn't beat for me, no
And when you're cold and lonely
They are not my arms
You long to feel around you
To keep you safe and warm
No I'm just a face in the crowd
You can't see
But save a little love for me
Save a little love for me, yearh
Save a little love for me, yeah yeah yeah
And I'll save my love for you
My face in the crowd
I don't know your name
And you don't know mine
Yet I'm wearing our initials
Round this heart of mine
I don't need no proof
To know that you are there
My heart is strong
And my wings are wide
I'm true to all my colors
And I wear them all with pride
I am your face
Your face in the crowd
So save a little love for me, yeah
Save a little love for me, yeah
Save a little love for me, yeah yeah yeah
Cause I'll save my love for you
My face in the crowd
In the twilight
Sometimes we meet
Just before we wake
Or as we fall asleep
I still can't see your face
And I know you can't see mine
But I can feel your heartbeat
You can hear my voice
You touch my soul
And my soul touches yours
And we make a promise
Somewhere down the line
So save a little love for me, yeah
Save a little love for me, yeah
Save a little love for me, yeah yeah yeah
Cause I'll save my love for you
All my love
My love, my face in the crowd
I don't know the color of your skin
But I've felt the love that lies within
And I'm sure, I know without a doubt
I'll find your face in the crowd
I'll never let this feeling slide
And no one can put my faith aside
Oh I'm sure I know without a doubt
I'll find your face in the crowd
Your face in the crowd
I'll find your face in the crowd
Your face in the crowd
I'm just a face in the crowd
You probably don't know me
As I don't stand out
No more teasing
No more pleasing
No more fools
No more rejection
Fuck detention
Fuck the rules
