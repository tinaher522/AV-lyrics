<song artist="Lionel_Richie" title="She's_Amazing">
She came on scene
I felt like I was in a movie, She parted the room
The way that Moses did the Red Sea
And from across the room
I felt her body talking to me (yeah)
Cause thing about her, thing about her
Is she was amazing, So amazing
She's amazing
She's amazing
No man alive would ever dream of talking to her
She gave off a vibe like
Come Tom, I want to see ya
And for whatever reason, I was feeling lucky that day
Cause thing about her, thing about her
Is she was amazing, So amazing
She's amazing
She's amazing
She's amazing in the daylight, She's amazing in the night,
Once you see her, She's the only thing on your mind
She's amazing, She's amazing, Every time she walks in to the room
She's a party girl, She's a party girl
Start dancing in the streets, Cause she's amazing
She's a party girl ...
