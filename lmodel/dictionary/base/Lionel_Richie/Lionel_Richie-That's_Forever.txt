<song artist="Lionel_Richie" title="That's_Forever">
Tell her you love her
Tell her you'll always be there
Tell her you need her more than anything
On your heart you know you swear
For all the best things in this life to come
You want here to be there
Tell her you need her more than anything
And that's forever
Tell her you want her
Tell her your heart belongs to her
Tell her the words that only lovers say
In a place where lovers stir
And now that she's wandered into this wonderland
She'll never ever want for more
Tell her you're lost inside this love affair
And that's forever
That's forever
That's forever
Oh, you are the love supreme
You're the woman I've been waiting for
The answer to all my dreams
And I close my eyes and breathe you
Like a breath of spring
Time won't mean a thing
Cause this love will never end
With you I've got a friend
And that's forever
Oh, you are the love supreme
You're the woman I've been waiting for
The answer to all my dreams
And I close my eyes and breathe you
Like a breath of spring
Time won't mean a thing
That's forever
That's forever
That's forever
That's forever
