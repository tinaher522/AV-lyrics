<song artist="Lionel_Richie" title="Get_Away">
Tonight is the night we're gonna let it go
Get on the floor and lose your self-control
Ain't nobody here to tell us what to do
Cause we're gonna make tonight about me and you
[Chorus]
Now is the time that we're gonna party all night long
Everything is fine cause we're not doing nothing wrong
That's what you came for
To get away just get away
And have some fun forget the day
You shouldn't care what people say
Come one let's get away
Think it's time to party like we used to do
The night has come go crazy act a fool
Let the DJ tell you how to break it down
Cause it's alright and it's all night
We're gonna do it up...
[Chorus]
When you come inside
Leave your trauma at the door
You ain't need it no more
And when you hear the music hit the floor
That's what you came for
To get away just get away
And have some fun forget the day
You shouldn't care what people say
Come one let's get away
[Repeats]
