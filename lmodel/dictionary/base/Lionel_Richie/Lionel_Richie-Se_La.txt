<song artist="Lionel_Richie" title="Se_La">
You know sometimes I sit
And wonder just how this world would be
If we hod all the people laughing
And everybody living in harmony.
We have to say - se la
Se la - talking to the people - se la
Se la
It's time you thought about it - se la
Se la
Se la
Se la
There would be no more living in desperation
And no more hatred and deceit.
Tell me
Can you imagine all the children playing
And everyone dancing in the street?
We say - la
Se la
Se la - do it
Say it - se la
Se la
Talking to everybody
Yeah - se la
Se la
You know what it's all about - se la
Se la.
You play for the people
Man
Play for the people.
It's time
You know
For everyone to come together
I know it's hard
But this dream must come to light.
Because life should be one big celebration
I'm talking to you now
Only we can make things right.
We say - la
Se la
Se la - do it on the good foot
Se la
Se la
Every
Every
Every - se la
Se la - talk about it
Sing about it
Talk about it
Sing about it - se la
Se la - talk about it
Sing about it.
All the children
Tell me about the children
We've got to help them now to survive.
One world
One heart
Is our salvation
Let us keep the dream alive.
We say - la
Se la
Se la - don't hold back no longer -
Se la
Se la
Can't you see it
Just believe it - se la
Se la
Talking to you now - se la
Se la
Talking to you now - se la
Se la
Se la
Se la - save the children - se la
Se la - save the children.
