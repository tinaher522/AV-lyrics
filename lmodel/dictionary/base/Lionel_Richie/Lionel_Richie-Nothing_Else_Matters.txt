<song artist="Lionel_Richie" title="Nothing_Else_Matters">
Do I love you?
Let me tell ya,
My Mona Lisa with a smile,
Knowing all that we've been through,
Together,
We've lasted for a while.
Hasn't it been so easy?
But life can be that way,
You made all the mountains,
Seem so small.
'Cause when there's love,
True love,
Nothing else matters,
At all.
Those precious moments,
Are filled with so much tears and laughter;
Funny how the time does fly.
Was it all a plan,
Or some passing chances?
I won't ask the reason why.
If I say I love you,
Let me tell you like it is,
Love you till the stars stars,
All start to fall.
'Cause when there's love,
True love,
Nothing else matters,
At all.
When I say I love you,
Let me tell you like it is,
Love you till the stars,
All start to fall.
Yes when there is love,
True love.
Yes when there is love,
True love.
Yes when there is love, true love;
Nothing else matters,
Nothing else matters,
Nothing else matters,
At all...
