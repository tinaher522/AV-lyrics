<song artist="Lionel_Richie" title="All_Around_The_World">
All around the world
Let's go all around the world
All around the world
Take me all around the world
I said all around the world
Let's go all around the world
Give me joy, give me love
Take it all around the world
I said all around the world
All around the world
Take me all around the world
I said I just got to know
It's time to let go
All around the world
Let's go all around the world
All around the world
Take me all around the world
I said all around the world
Let's go all around the world
Give me joy, give me love
Take it all around the world
Make a wish, dreams come true
Follow your heart, it is only for you
Crazy, it's a crazy world
Come to the music, come lose your mind
Follow thw rhythm, don't get left behind
All around the world
Let's go all around the world
I said all around the world
Take me all around the world
I said I just got to know
It's time to let go
I said all around the world
Let's go all around the world
Give me joy, give me love
Take it all around the world
