Wooh
I look at you 
You look at me 
(you can't help it yeah we're feeling butterflies) 
It's obvious, 
We got some chemistry 
(i think I know what it feels so right) 
Now I wanted so long to know 
Now you're telling me you gotta let it go 
(dont tell me I have to start all over again) 
I never thought this day would come 
(this is something that I've wanted in my life) 
I realize that you're the one 
(and you're telling me it's time to say goodbye) 
What's inside of my heart it ain't gonna change 
So it shouldn't be so easy to walk away 
(you feel it I feel it let's not pretend let's not pretend) 
Maybe I don't know what love is 
Maybe I'm a fool 
I just know what I'm feeling 
And it's all because of you 
Don't tell me 
I don't know 
I want the truth 
Cause they call it 
We call it 
You call it 
I call it love 
It's so clear for you to see 
(don't let nobody tell you what to do) 
Why they can't they just let us be happy 
(i don't want to find somebody new) 
If you know what's really in your heart 
Then don't let 'em tear us apart 
(cause you feel it I feel it let's think it through) 
Maybe I don't know what love is (maybe I'm a fool)
Maybe I'm a fool 
I just know what I'm feeling 
And it's all because of you (please don't)
Don't tell me 
I don't know 
I want the truth 
Cause they call it (yeah)
We call it (yeah)
You call it (wooh)
I call it love 
We have a bond that's unbreakable 
And it's not time to let it go (we're in love)
And now that we know it's real 
We're going to let it show 
To the whole world 
That I'm yours forever 
And you're my girl 
You're my everything
Ooh, I don't know
Maybe I don't know what love is 
Maybe I'm a fool (maybe I'm a fool)
I just know what I'm feeling 
And it's all because of you (it's all because of you)
Don't tell me 
I don't know 
I want the truth (I want the truth)
Cause they call it (they call)
We call it 
You call it 
I call it love 
Maybe I don't know what love is 
Maybe I'm a fool (i call it)
I just know what I'm feeling 
And it's all because of you (all cause of you)
Don't tell me 
I don't know (baby)
I want the truth 
Cause they call it (they call)
We call it (we call)
You call it (you call)
I call it love (I call it)
Love 
They call it love 
I call it 
Love
