<song artist="Lionel_Richie" title="That's_The_Way_I_Feel">
You are that gentle breeze on a summer's day
You are the beat inside my heart
You are that place that I go when I need someone that's real
I want you to know that's the way I feel
I can look in your eyes and see every dream I've dreamed
I can see peace inside your fire
I can see joy in my life then only your love can reveal
I want you to know that's the way I feel
Life is a mystry
How lucky I am that your love has found me
thatfor, you are the key that opened the door to a world of (   ) 
And yes, I find that this is the my moment of my time
To really let you know the way you make me feel
You are that place that I go when I need someone that's real
A something, A gentle touch, A lover's hand to hold
Your the passion in my life is real
I want you to know that's the way, I feel
