<song artist="Lionel_Richie" title="Through_My_Eyes">
Baby we were so in love
Only one that I could trust
I would never give that up there's no one like her
Knew you were my everything
Was so glad that you wit me
Had to tell my family, I found that girl
Then out of nowhere you were gone without a reason why
So I'm here in this place by myself, all you had to do was try
If you could see it through my eyes
It would explain the tears I cried
Why did you walk out of my life
Wasn't it clear to see that you were meant for me
If you could see it through my eyes
You'd know the reason why I tried
So hard to never let love die
I wish that you could see
See it through my eyes
What am I supposed to do
Just go on without you
Easier said than done, I need some answers
Can't even lift my head
Thinking bout the things she said
Only thing that I have left, is my love for her
I'm hoping and praying, that you will return
All my love is here waiting for you, baby just open the door
