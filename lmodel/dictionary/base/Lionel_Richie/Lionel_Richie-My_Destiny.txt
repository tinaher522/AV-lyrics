<song artist="Lionel_Richie" title="My_Destiny">
You came in
That's what my little heart was looking for
laughter in the rain
feeling like a fool in love again
Oh,the laughter came
when the tears stopped falling
now all I do is just call your name
you walked in and my heart discovered
that my life would never be the same
I know
you are my destiny
You are my one and only
You gave that joy to me
When my whole life was lonely
Angel in disguise
with your power of love
just hypnotize
I just love the magic of your spell
How much joy we have together
Only time will tell!
Oh, the laughter came
when the tears stopped falling
Now all I do is just call your name
(I just call your name)
You walked in and my heart discovered
That my life would never be the same!
I know, you are my destiny
You are my one and only
You gave that joy to me
When my whole life was lonely!
Every day, every night
Oh, I know it's so right
When I see your face
Only time's gonna tell
But I know you so well
Girl, my love's for real
From the first time that I saw you
I know it was forever
This mighty love between us
Will keep us together
you're the girl God sent from heaven
I'm so glad I found you
forever, forever, forever, forever, forever, forever!
I'm so glad to be around you
I know, you are my destiny
You are my one and only
You gave that joy to me
When my whole world was lonely!
It's alright, it's alright
Do it again!
It's alright, it's alright
Don't let this love end!
It's alright, it's alright
Do it again!
It's alright, it's alright
Don't let this love end!
From the first time that I saw you
I know it was forever
This mighty love between us
Will keep us together
you're the girl God sent from heaven
I'm so glad I found you
forever, forever, forever, forever, forever, forever!
I'm so glad to be around you!
you are my destiny
You are my one and only
You gave that joy to me
When my whole world was lonely!
you are my destiny
You are my one and only
You gave that joy to me
When my whole world was lonely!
it's alright
Do it again!
It's alright, it's alright
Don't let this love end!
It's alright, it's alright
Do it again!
It's alright, it's alright
Don't let this love end!
it's alright
Do it again!
It's alright, it's alright
Don't let this love end!
