<song artist="Lionel_Richie" title="Just_To_Be_With_You_Again">
So I still walk on through the night 
And through the rain... 
I would give it all 
Just to be with you again 
Its a lonely road 
For my heart is still in chains 
But I live my life 
Just to be with you again 
We have walked together 
Where angels go 
And we found a place inside us 
That only we could know 
So I still walk on 
Through the night and through the rain 
I would give it all 
Just to be with you again 
Thats the way life goes 
Like a whisper in the wind 
But Ill take that fall 
Just to be with you again 
Can I find a reason 
Can I find a way 
Cause the words I need to tell you 
Are the words I didnt say 
So I still walk on through the night 
And through the rain 
I would give it all 
Just to be with you again 
I see you standing in the doorway 
With that look thats in your eyes 
And that feeling that I feel will never die 
So I still walk on 
Through the night and through the rain 
I would give it all 
Just to be with you again 
Well thats the way life goes... 
Like a whisper in the wind 
I would give it all 
Just to be with you again 
Its a lonely road when my heart 
Is still in chains 
But I live my life 
Just to be with you again
