<song artist="Lionel_Richie" title="Everybody_Needs_Somebody_To_Love">
[Chorus]
Say you, say me; say it for always
That's the way it should be
Say you, say me; say it together
Naturally
I had a dream I had an awesome dream
People in the park playing games in the dark
And what they played was a masquerade
And from behind of walls of doubt a voice was crying out
Say you, say me
[Chorus]
As we go down life's lonesome highway
Seems the hardest thing to do is to find a friend or two
A helping hand
Some one who understands
That when you feel you've lost your way
You've got some one there to say "I'll show you"
[Chorus]
So you think you know the answers, Oh no
'Couse the whole world has got you dancing
That's right, I'm telling you
It's time to start believing - Oh yes
Believing who you are: You are a shining star
[Chorus]
Say it together, naturally.
