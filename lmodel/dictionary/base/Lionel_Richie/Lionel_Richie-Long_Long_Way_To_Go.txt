<song artist="Lionel_Richie" title="Long_Long_Way_To_Go">
You held my hand 
And then you slipped away 
And I may never see your face again 
So tell me how to fill this emptiness inside 
Without love what is life 
And anyone who knew us both can see 
We always were the better part of me 
Never wanted to be this free 
And all this pain 
When does it go away 
And everytime I turn around 
And you are nowhere to be found 
I know 
I gotta long long way to go 
Before I can say goodbye 
To you 
I gotta long long way I know 
Before I can say goodbye 
To all I ever knew 
Oh you 
From memory there is no hiding place 
Turn on the tv and I see you there 
In every crowd there's always someone 
With your face 
Everywhere 
Trying not to care 
And everytime I turn around 
And you are nowhere to be found 
I know 
I gotta a long way to go 
Before I can say goodbye to you 
I gotta long way I know 
Before I can say goodbye 
To all I ever knew 
To you I wish you everything 
And all the best that life can bring 
I only hope you think of me sometimes 
And even though I feel the pain 
I know that I will love again 
But time will come 
And I'll move on 
I gotta long way to go 
Long long way to go 
Before I can say goodbye 
The only thing I wante 
Everything I needed 
I gotta long way to go 
I know 
Everything I needed 
Before I can say goodbye 
To you 
Everything I knew 
Long long way to go 
Before I can say goodbye 
To you
