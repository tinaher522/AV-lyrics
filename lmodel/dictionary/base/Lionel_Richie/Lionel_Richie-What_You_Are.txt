<song artist="Lionel_Richie" title="What_You_Are">
(Lionel speaking)
Listen , baby by the time you get this letter
I'll be gone
But I left something for you on the pillow
Put this tape in, press play
I love you
It's four in the morning and I'm sitting here at night 
I'm writing you this song to say what's on my mind 
I'm leaving in an hour and you won't be up in time to say goodbye (whoa) 
I'm putting this on tape (baby you're wonderful) 
I really mean it babe (more than you will ever know) 
I wish that I could stay (but I gotta go) 
I'll be back but in the meantime 
Keep in mind that 
You are 
Is something too big for words 
And it's my pleasure to love you baby for better or worse 
Cause what you are 
A beautiful mother to your kids 
Sometimes it slips my mind so in case I forget 
Girl you are better than (anything) 
I ever had 
You are the perfect love 
Never give you up 
(Because you are) my heart and soul my breath 
Take it all until theres nothing left 
Cause baby you are 
Now no man has ever loved his woman 
more than I love you, girl you know it's true 
And no man can ever say he does his woman better than I do you 
Cause that ain't true (here's what I do) 
Send you fresh-cut roses every day of the week 
Take you shopping whenever 
More importantly 
Wrap my loving arms around you 
To reassure everything I felt that first night 
I feel it and more
