<song artist="Lionel_Richie" title="You_Mean_More_To_Me">
You mean more to me,
Than words can ever say
Just to hold your hand
And to know our love will stay
Feels so right
You're in my arms, my love
Tonight
Oh you,
You mean more to me
Than any love I've ever known
And I want to give you all my love
Just you alone
Oh
You're all my dreams come true
There's so much joy in your eyes 
And all the love you give
You've finally made me realize
You're all I need
Oh, you
You mean more to me
Than words can ever say
