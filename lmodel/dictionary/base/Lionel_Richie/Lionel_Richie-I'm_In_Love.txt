<song artist="Lionel_Richie" title="I'm_In_Love">
Umm, oh, oh
Lo lo lo lo, I hear you love,
Lo lo lo lo, I hear you love,
Lo lo lo lo, I hear you love,
No tears, no tears, no more, I'm done crying out
No pain, no pain, said I found another way
No games not like before
Not up here on this cloud, no time for yesterday
Let me explain,
I got a new woman, lovin me in every way that she can
All she wanna be is part of my plan
Safe to say that I'm in a better way, a better way, hey
You got a new woman loves to walk around just holding my hand
Cupid must have found us loving like that, loving this woman, 
Does anybody understand
That I'm in love, love, love, and I think about the real thing
Real love, kind of love that makes your heart say
Love, love
You got me singing la la la la la
Say I'm in love
Love, love
And I think if I'm the real thing
Real love
Kind of love that makes your heart say
Love, love
No stress, no fuss, no fight when I'm in your arms
No time, no day, no night
(no nothing better, no)
So much more than ok (ok)
Life is made of this, no her, no me , no way
Let me explain,
I got a new woman, lovin me in every way that she can
All she wanna be is part of my plan
Safe to say that I'm in a better way, a better way, hey
You got a new woman loves to walk around just holding my hand
Cupid must have found us loving like that, loving this woman, 
Does anybody understand
That I'm in love, love, love, and I think about the real thing
Real love, kind of love that makes your heart say
Love, love
You got me singing la la la la la
Say I'm in love
Love, love
And I think if I'm the real thing
Real love
Kind of love that makes your heart say
Love, love
You got me singing la la la la la la I'm in love
I want the whole damn world to know, sure as the wind blows,
To carry the message far as it can go
That I'm in love
Nothing can hold back this feeling,
True love in which we are dealing,
Baby,
I, I, I, I, I'm in love
I, I, I, I, I'm in love
I, I'm in love
I, I, I, I, I'm in love
I, I, I, I, I'm in love
I, I'm in love
That I'm in love, love, love, and I think about the real thing
Real love, kind of love that makes your heart say
Love, love
You got me singing la la la la la
Say I'm in love
Love, love
And I think if I'm the real thing
Real love
Kind of love that makes your heart say,
Love, love
You got me singing la la la la la la I'm in loved morning, another beautiful day
