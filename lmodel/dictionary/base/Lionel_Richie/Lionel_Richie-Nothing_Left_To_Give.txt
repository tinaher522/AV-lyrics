<song artist="Lionel_Richie" title="Nothing_Left_To_Give">
I walked the land
(and released all the weight on my shoes)
And I sailed the seas
(and watched all my dreams come true)
I flew the sky
(and seen everything from a birds view)
And I rode the streets
(and reality brought me back to you)
That’s when I realized
That we gotta be alive
And party like there’s nothing left to give
(Yeah)
It’s nothing
(Yeah)
There’s nothing
(Yeah)
Party like there’s nothing left to give
(ooooooh)
Can you imagine going thru life so crazy
So busy don’t have time to be with your baby
Need to go out and enjoy this nightlife to save me
I been feelin oh so good ‘bout how things going lately
That’s when I realzed
That we gotta be alive
And party like there’s nothing left to give
People to the left (ay!)
People to the right (ay!)
If you’re going thru some things in life
Just know it’s gon’ be alright
Now all my fellas to the left (ay!)
Ladies to the right (ay!)
If you’re going thru some things in life
Just know it’s gon’ be alright
So can you give it all to me
(uh huh)
So can you give it all to me
(uh huh)
Wanna feel your energy
(oh yeah)
Wanna se you rock with me
(oh yeah)
So can you give it all to me
(uh huh)
So can you give it all to me
(uh huh)
Wanna feel your energy
(oh yeah)
Wanna se you rock with me
(oh yeah)
Let me hear you singin
Party like there’s nothing left to give
