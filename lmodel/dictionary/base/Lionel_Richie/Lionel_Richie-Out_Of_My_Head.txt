<song artist="Lionel_Richie" title="Out_Of_My_Head">
There's a cold wind that's into my heart 
There's woman tearing me apart 
There's avoice I hear of every word that 
she said 
I'm going out of my head 
There's a feeling I get every night 
There's a thing I miss about holding her tight 
There's an emptiness I just want her here in my bed 
I'm going out of my head 
Sentimental fool in love am I 
Thinking that true love would never die 
I know she said goodbye 
But I ain't giving in 
If I give her just a little while 
She might see me again 
Sentimental fool in love am I 
Thinking that true love would never die 
I know that it's all wrong 
But I'll think this instead 
Wish I could get her back again 
I'm going out of my head
