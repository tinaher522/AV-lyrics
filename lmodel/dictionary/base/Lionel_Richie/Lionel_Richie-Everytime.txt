<song artist="Lionel_Richie" title="Everytime">
Everytime I hold you 
I get that though and feeling all over me
And everytime I touch you honey, 
Oh brings back those feeling
And those memories
Everytime I thinking you babe
I realize that hurt girl 
That I catch you through
But grab these love that is an answer
And I belive that's an answer here for me and you.
'cause everytime I feel my heart on fire I only want a have you love
'cause everytime I feel that warm desire only takes it just one kiss
and the girl I can't resist 'cause I just can stop this burning inside
Ohhhhhhhhhh !
'Cause everytime I feel my heart on fire
I only want a have you love
'Cause everytime I feel that warm desire
Only takes it just one kiss
And the girl I can't resist
'Cause I just can stop this burning inside
Ohhhhhhhhhh !
Everytime, everytime, everytime
I just want to tell you babe that nothing in this world
Can take the place from you in my life
You got you know that you are the answer
You got to know that you are the reason
For those wonder years 
And those years and those holding on..
Everytime I look around I see (everytime)
Everytime I look around I want you (everytime)
Everytime I close my eyes (everytime)
Oh ! I realize, I realize (everytime)
You're my everything
You're all I ever wanted
Nobody, nobody
