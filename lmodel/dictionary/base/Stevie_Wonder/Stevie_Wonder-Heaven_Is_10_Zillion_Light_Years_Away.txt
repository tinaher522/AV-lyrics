<song artist="Stevie_Wonder" title="Heaven_Is_10_Zillion_Light_Years_Away">
They say that heaven is 
10 zillion light years away
And just the pure at heart 
Will walk her righteous streets someday
They say that heaven is 
10 zillion light years away
But if there is a God 
We need Him now 
Where is your God?
That's what my friends ask me
And I say it's taken Him so long
'Cause we've got so far to come
Tell me people
Why can't they say that hate 
Is 10 zillion light years away?
Why can't the light of good 
Shine God's love in every soul?
Why must my color black 
Make me a lesser man?
I thought this world was made 
For every man
He loves us all
That's what my God tells me
And I say it's taken Him so long
'Cause we've got so far to come
But in my heart I can 
Feel it (Yeah)
Feel His spirit, Woah woah woah
Feel it (Yeah) 
Feel His spirit
I can't say that heaven is 
10 zillion light years away
But if so let all be pure at heart
Just to walk her righteous streets I pray
Let God's love shine within 
To save our evil souls
For those who don't believe (Sinner)
Will never see the light
Where is my God?
He lives inside of me
And I say it's taken Him so long
'Cause we've got so far to come
Now people
Where is your God?
Inside please let Him be
And I say it's taken Him so long
'Cause we've got so far to come
But if you open your heart you can 
Feel it (Yeah)
Feel His spirit, Woah woah woah
Feel it (Yeah) 
You can feel His spirit, I opened my heart one morning and I sho nuff could 
Feel it (Yeah) 
Feel His spirit (Yeah) 
You can feel it (Yeah)
Feel His spirit
You can feel it (Yeah)
Feel His spirit
