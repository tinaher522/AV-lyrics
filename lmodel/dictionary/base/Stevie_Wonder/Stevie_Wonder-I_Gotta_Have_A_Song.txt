<song artist="Stevie_Wonder" title="I_Gotta_Have_A_Song">
Got no place to be
No one's needing me
My girl just said we're through
Love was here to stay
Only yesterday
Today my world is blue
So show me to where there's music
Show me to where there's music
With music I just might go on
I gotta have a song
To go it alone
I gotta have a song
Had a happy home
Now it's turned to stone
Kitchen's cold and bare
She'd cook all day for me
I still hurry home to see
But I know that she's not there
So show me to where there's music
Show me to where there's music
With music I just might go on
I gotta have a song
To go it alone
To a song
Show me to where there's music
Show me to where there's music
With music, I just can't go wrong
I gotta have a song
A happy happy song
A happy happy song
I gotta have a song, baby
A happy happy song
I gotta have a song
