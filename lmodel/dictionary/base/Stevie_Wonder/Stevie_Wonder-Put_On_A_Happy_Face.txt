<song artist="Stevie_Wonder" title="Put_On_A_Happy_Face">
Gray skies are gonna clear up, yeah
Put on a happy face
Brush off the clouds and cheer up
Put on a happy face
Take off that gloomy mask of tragedy
It's not your style
You'll look so good that you'll be glad that you
Decided to smile
Pick out a pleasant outlook
Stick out that noble chin
Wipe off that "full of doubt" look
Put on a happy grin
And spread sunshine all over the place
Just put on a happy face
Take off that gloomy mask of tragedy
It's not your style
You'll look so good that you'll be glad that you
Decided to smile
Pick out a pleasant outlook
Stick out that noble chin
Wipe off that "full of doubt" look
Put on a happy grin
And spread sunshine all over the place
Just put on a happy face
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Just put on a happy face
