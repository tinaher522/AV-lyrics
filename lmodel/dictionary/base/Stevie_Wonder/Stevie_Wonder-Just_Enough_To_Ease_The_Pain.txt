<song artist="Stevie_Wonder" title="Just_Enough_To_Ease_The_Pain">
If my world seemed dark and gloomy
And my life seemed not worthwhile
Would you leave me here alone girl?
Would you leave me here to cry?
How you say you idolize me
Don't leave me in dismay
Now you know my heart is dying
Yet you leave me here to cry
Now you turn and walk away
You give me love enough to ease the pain
And then you take your love away
You give me love enough to ease the pain
And then you take your love away from me
Now I've been my own palm reader
And I've shown myself the way
Girl, don't you have no good intentions
For with a dying heart you play
You give me love enough to ease the pain
And then you take your love away
You give me love enough to ease the pain
And then you take your love away from me
