<song artist="Stevie_Wonder" title="Stranger_On_The_Shore_Of_Love">
The curtain goes up
The first act begins
The scene is two people in love
Lovely is she, lucky feels he
She smiles in his eyes
He smiles in her eyes
They both vow love never to part
One sight for all, lovers to see
A perfect love story begins 'til insecurity sets in
What happens then is, one aching heart
Oh, I don’t wanna be
No stranger on the shore of love with tears, and a broken heart
I can tell you that I don’t wanna be
No stranger on the shore of love with tears, and a broken heart
A table for two
Love vows of  'I do'
A honeymoon out of a dream
Who could ask for, anything more
A home on a hill
With love daffodils
And cold winter nights by the fire
What more could be, for she and he
There’s more than enough love and yet
She or he starts feeling regret
What do you get? One broken heart
Oh, I don’t wanna be
No stranger on the shore of love with tears, and a broken heart
I can tell you from experience, I don’t wanna be
No stranger on the shore of love with tears, and a broken heart
I don’t wanna be
No stranger on the shore of love with tears, and a broken heart
I don’t wanna be, please don’t let me be
No stranger on the shore of love with tears, and a broken heart
No, I don’t wanna be
No stranger on the shore of love with tears, and a broken heart
I don’t wanna be
No stranger on the shore of love with tears, and a broken heart
