<song artist="Stevie_Wonder" title="The_Shadow_Of_Your_Smile">
The shadow of your smile when you are gone
Will color all my dreams and light the dawn
Look into my eyes, my love, and see
All the lovely things you are to me
Our wistful little star was far too high
A teardrop kissed your lips and so did I
Now when I remember spring
All the joy that love can bring
I will be remembering
The shadow of your smile
Now when I remember spring
All the joy that love can bring
I will be remembering
The shadow of your smile
The shadow of your smile
The shadow of your smile
The shadow of your smile
