<song artist="Stevie_Wonder" title="So_What_The_Fuss">
If I'm caught at a dance party
Without my dancin' shoes
And everybody dances on my bare feet
Shame on me
If I'm mindin' my business
Just doin the right thing
And you try to front me off in the street
Shame on you
If a family's waiting for that
Special blessing to come their way
But they ain't tryin' to get on
Their knees and pray
Shame on them
And if we live in a time where
Every nation's fightin' 'round the world
Yet we can't all agree that peace is the way
Shame on us
Shame on me,
Shame on you,
Shame on them,
Shame on us
Shame on me,
Shame on you,
Shame on them,
Shame on us
So what the fuss
If I gotta get up early in the morning
For a job interview
And I forget to set the stupid alarm
Shame on me
If my children are playin' outside
Like little children do
And you come 'round there
Trying to bring them some harm
Shame on you
Should I be drivin' thru a klantown
Find a restaurant to get me some food
And someone says "hey boy, we don't serve your kind"
Shame on them
And if we live in a democracy
And you don't use your power to vote
Knowin' some would like to turn back the hands of time
Shame on us
Shame on me,
Shame on you,
Shame on them,
Shame on us
Shame on me,
Shame on you,
Shame on them,
Shame on us
So what the fuss
If I'm hooked on a habit
Knowin damn well it could cost me my life
Yet I keep doin what I should do without
Shame on me
If you're locked in a marriage
And your other half just gives you abuse
Yet you've convinced yourself that there's no way out
Shame on you
If we're jammin' the music
And somebody's got the audacity
To say that they can jam it better than us
Shame on them
And should there be just a handful that believe
That we are totally free
And there's no need to fight for equality
Shame on us
Shame on me,
Shame on you,
Shame on them,
Shame on us
Shame on me,
Shame on you,
Shame on them,
Shame on us
So what the fuss
