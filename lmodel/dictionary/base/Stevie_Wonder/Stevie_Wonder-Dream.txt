<song artist="Stevie_Wonder" title="Dream">
Dream, when you're feeling blue
Oh dream, that's the thing to do
Just watch the smoke rings rise in the air
You'll find your share of memories there
So dream, when the day is through
Oh dream, they just might come true
You know things never are as bad as they seem
So dream, dream, dream
