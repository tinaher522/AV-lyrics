<song artist="Stevie_Wonder" title="Mr._Tambourine_Man">
Hey Mr. Tambourine Man play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there ain't no place I'm going to
Hey Mr. Tambourine Man play a song for me
In the jingle-jangle morning I'll come following you
Take me on a trip upon your magic swirling ship
All my senses have been stripped
And my hands can't feel to grip
And my toes too numb to step
Wait only for my boot heels to be wandering
I'm ready to go anywhere, I'm ready for to fade
Into my own parade
Cast your dancing spell my way
I promise to go under it
Oh, hey Mr. Tambourine Man play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there ain't no place I'm going to
Hey Mr. Tambourine Man play a song for me
In the jingle-jangle morning I'll come following you
