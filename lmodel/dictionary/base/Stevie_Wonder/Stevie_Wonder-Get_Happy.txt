<song artist="Stevie_Wonder" title="Get_Happy">
Forget your troubles come on get happy
You better chase all your cares away
Sing hallelujah come on get happy
And get ready for the Judgment Day
The sun is shining come on get happy
The Lord is waiting to take your hand
Shout hallelujah come on get happy
We're going to the Promised Land
We're heading 'cross the river
Wash our sins 'way in the tide
It's all so peaceful on the other side
Forget your troubles come on get happy
You better chase all your cares away
Shout hallelujah come on get happy
And get ready for the Judgment Day
We're heading 'cross the river
Wash our sins 'way in the tide
It's all so peaceful on the other side
Forget your troubles come on get happy
You better chase all your cares away
Shout hallelujah come on get happy
And get ready for the Judgment Day
