<song artist="Stevie_Wonder" title="(You're_My)_Dream_Come_True">
I don't care where you came from
Oh no, I don't care where you've been
All I know, is that I love you
And I'm going to love you till the end (Gonna love you until the end)
'Cause you're my...(Dream come true)
You're my...(Dream come true)
You're my...(Dream come true)
And I love you better than anyone before
For every hand there's a glove
For every, for every heart there should be love
Yes, I've been waiting for such a long, long time
Don't worry, nobody, nobody is gonna change my mind (Nobody's gonna change my mind)
'Cause you're my...(Dream come true)
You're my...(Dream come true)
You're my...(Dream come true)
And I love you better than anyone before
Yes, you're my...(Dream come true)
You're my...(Dream come true)
You're my...(Dream come true)
And I love you better than anyone before
(Better than anyone, better than anyone...)
I love you (Better than anyone)
Than anyone before. (Better than anyone before)
A-do me right because I love you (Better than anyone)
Keep coming 'cause I love you (Better than anyone)
