<song artist="Stevie_Wonder" title="Everything_Is_Happenin'">
See how the world is scared, on the street turning bare
Most of the new is bad, crime just breeds in the air
Sad is the song, rolling along, everything is happenin'
Weired is the tune, now we are doomed, everything is happenin'
Cost of living's up, but the pay is low down
Hate to see the baby starve âcause Mama can't be found
Sister lives alone, bolts and chains her door at night
Never ever walks an alley or a shorter way
See how the world is scared, on the street turning bare
Most of the new is bad, crime just breeds in the air
Sad is the song, rolling along, everything is happenin'
Brother Bill's gone fighting in a place where he's a stranger
But could men die a stranger in every war?
We all hide is shame, boldly pointing to another
When the blame we know for sure is right in ourselves
In ourselves, in ourselves, in oursleves
See how the world is scared, on the street turning bare
Most of the new is bad, crime just breeds in the air
Sad is the song, rolling along, everything is happenin'
