<song artist="Stevie_Wonder" title="Hallelujah_I_Love_Her_So_(Piano_And_Vocals)">
Let me tell you about a girl I know,
She's my baby and I love her so,
In the morning when the sun comes up,
She brings me coffee in my favorite cup,
That's how I know,
Yes I know,
Hallelujah I just love her so,
And if I call her on the telephone,
I say baby 'I was all alone',
By the time I count 1 to 4
She'll be *knock knock knock*,
On my door,
Well,
In the evening when the sun goes down,
And there ain't nobody else around,
She kisses me and then she Holds me tight,
I say 'Baby, everything's alright',
That's how I know,
Yes I know,
Hallelujah I just love her so,
And if I call her on the telephone,
I say 'Baby, bring yourself alone',
By the time I count 1 to 4
She'll be *knock knock knock*,
On my door,
Well,
In the evening when the sun goes down,
And there ain't nobody else around,
She kisses me and then she Holds me tight,
I say 'Skip me baby, everything's swinging'
That's how I know,
Yes I know,
Hallelujah I just love her so,
Well,
Hallelujah I just love her so,
Well,
Hallelujah I just love her so
