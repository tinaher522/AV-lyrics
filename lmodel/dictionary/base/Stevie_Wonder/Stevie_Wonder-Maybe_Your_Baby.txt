<song artist="Stevie_Wonder" title="Maybe_Your_Baby">
Do you know how I feel?
Can you feel it?
I'm talking to you...
I'm feelin down, with some kind of lovin'
Cause my baby done left me here
Heart is blazin' like a five alarm fire
And I don't even give a care
I feel like the world has turned on me
My dreams turned to ashes right
in front of my face
I'm getting kind of worried
And I feel so all upset, mmm
Maybe your baby done made some other plans
Maybe your baby done made some other plans
I feel like cryin'
In the mornin when I got a heartache
I can't call up the doctor for help
Cause the only person that could ever do me any good
Is steppin' out with my best friend
I feel like I'm slippin' deeper
Slippin' deeper into my shell
And I just don't know how to take it
This stuff is scarin' me to death
Maybe your baby done made some other plans
Maybe your baby done made some other plans
I feel like cryin'
Little Sally Walker, sitting in a saucer
Checking out the guys that are passing by
by,by,by,by,by, ooh ooh by
Maybe your baby done made some other plans
Maybe your baby done made some other plans
No other man could love you like I do
Maybe your baby done made some other plans
Maybe your baby done made some other plans
Can you feel it?
I've got plans for you baby
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
I just can't take it anymore
You know I don't want any trouble
Now I ask myself
Do you want my baby
Do you want me baby
I've got plans for you baby
