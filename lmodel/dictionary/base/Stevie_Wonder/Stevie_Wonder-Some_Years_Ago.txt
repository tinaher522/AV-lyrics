<song artist="Stevie_Wonder" title="Some_Years_Ago">
Once upon the blood of many
We were cast as less than any
To so much a point some still believe
Smaller scene, a world much bigger
Where it's okay to play with the word "nigger"
Yet would we knowing all the grief and death it breeds
But that was some years ago
When we had more hope than money
A time and a world ago
When our hearts were made of steel
Back then it was all about
Stamping all the hatred out
So that now there would be no doubt
Who wouldn't have to heal
But why if so long ago
We're seen safe only when funny
As if there's no need to show
Deep inside what we really feel
Yet those things when brought to view
Seem to bother but a few
No if we don't come for real
Our wounds won't heal
Black silhouettes used as target practice
There's Darkie Toothpaste borne out of this malice
These stereotypical images come to mind
Figurines, mascots, postcards of us hanging
Most recent here, of one of us dragging
The propaganda machine must tell the truth
This time stop lying
But that was some years ago
When we had more hope than money
A time and a world ago
When our hearts were made of steel
Back then it was all about
Stamping all the hatred out
So that now there would be no doubt
Who wouldn't have to heal
But why if so long ago
We're seen safe only when funny
As if there's no need to show
Deep inside what we really feel
Yet those things when brought to view
Seem to bother but a few
No if we don't come for real
Our wounds won't heal
But that was some years ago
When we had more hope than money
A time and a world ago
When our hearts were made of steel
Back then it was all about
Stamping all the hatred out
So that now there would be no doubt
Who wouldn't have to heal
Oh, what if so long ago
We're seen safe only when funny
As if there's no need to show
Deep inside what we really feel
Yet those things when brought to view
Seem to bother but a few
No if we don't come for real
Our wounds won't heal
No if we don't come for real
Our wounds won't heal
