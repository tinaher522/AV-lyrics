<song artist="Stevie_Wonder" title="Baby_Don't_You_Do_It">
Don't you do it
Don't you break my heart
Oh baby, don't you do it, darlin'
Don't you break my heart
Don't you do it, baby
Don't you break my heart
Well I sacrifice to make you happy
Kept nothin' for myself
Now you wanna leave me
For the love of someone else
My pride is all gone
Whether right or wrong
I need you, baby
Girl to keep on keepin' on
Girl, I try to do my best
Tried and tried to do my best
Don't you do it babe
Don't you break my heart
Oh, don't you do it baby
My biggest mistake was lovin' you too much
And lettin' you know
'Cause now you've got me where you want me
And you will let me go
If my heart was made of glas
Then you should have seen
Heartaches and misery
Girl, you've been causin' me
Girl, I try to do my best
Tried and tried to do my best
Don't you do it girl
Don't you break my heart
Oh, don't you do
Go down to the river
And there I'll be
Well, I'm gonna jump in, darlin'
If you don't see by me
Open up your eyes
Can't you see I love you-love you-love you?
Open up your heart
Can't you see I need you, baby?
I'm no good without you
Just can't go on without you
Still no good without you
Life's no good without you
Hey ...
Oh, don't you break my heart
Don't do it
