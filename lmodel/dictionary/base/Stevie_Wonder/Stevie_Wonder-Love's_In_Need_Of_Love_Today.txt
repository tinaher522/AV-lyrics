<song artist="Stevie_Wonder" title="Love's_In_Need_Of_Love_Today">
Ooo...
Good morn or evening friends
Here's your friendly announcer
I have serious news to pass on to everybody
What I'm about to say
Could mean the world's disaster
Could change your joy and laughter to tears and pain
It's that, love's, in need, of love today
Don't delay, send yours in right away
Hate's goin' round, breaking many hearts
Stop, it please, before it's gone too far
Ooo...
The force of evil plans
To make you it's possession
And it will if we let it
Destroy everybody
We all must take
Precautionary measures
If love and peace you treasure
Then you'll hear me when I say
Woah that, love's, in need, of love today
Don't delay, send yours in right away
Hate's goin' round, breaking many hearts
Stop, it please, before it's gone too far
People you know that, love's, in need, of love today
Don't delay, send yours in right away
You know that hate's goin' round, breaking many hearts
Stop, stop it please, before it's gone too far
It's up to you cause, love's, in need, of love today
Don't delay, send yours in right away
You know that hate's goin' round, breaking many hearts
Stop, you've got to stop it please, before it's gone too far
It's up to you cause, love's, in need, of love today
Don't delay, send yours in right away
You know that hate's goin' round, breaking many hearts
Stop, you've got to stop it please, before it's gone too far
It's up to you cause, love's, in need, of love today
Don't delay, send yours in right away
Hate's goin' round, bring it down a little 
Love is very peaceful, so bring it down a little
Love's, in need, of love today
Don't delay, send yours in right away
Hate's goin' round, breaking many hearts
Stop, it please, before it's gone too far
Stop, it please, before it's gone too far
Just give the world Love
