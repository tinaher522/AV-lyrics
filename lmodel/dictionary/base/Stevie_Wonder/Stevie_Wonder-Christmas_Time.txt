<song artist="Stevie_Wonder" title="Christmas_Time">
It's Christmastime and its magic is here 
It's Christmastime and its wonders appear 
The scent of pine fills the Christmasy air 
While the church bell chimes and there's joy everywhere 
Some precious gift lights a little one's eyes 
God's blessed lived, stays the weary and wild 
This Christmastime, keep its magic right here 
Within your heart everyday of the year 
This Christmastime, keep its magic right here 
Within your heart everyday of the year
