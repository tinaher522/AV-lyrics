<song artist="Stevie_Wonder" title="If_Ever">
I'd sing you a song, without a word
Still you would hear my tune
I'd give you a day, without a time
So it won't end too soon
Anything, i would do
And that really is my point of view
If ever, my darling in my life
I ever had a chance to love you
I'd build you a world made of the dream
That dances in your head
Take a rainbow with colors bright
To hang over your bed
Anything, i would do
And that really is my point of view
If ever, my darling in my life
I ever had a chance to love you
Fate's been waiting for the right time
To put us in each other's arms
But why should we sit and waste time
To start right now would do no harm
Give me a sign and i will show you
The magic of when i speak
Open your heart, let me come in
My love is yours to keep
Anything, i would do
And that really is my point of view
If ever, my darling in my life
I ever had a chance to love you
If i ever had a chance to love you
If i ever had a chance to love you
