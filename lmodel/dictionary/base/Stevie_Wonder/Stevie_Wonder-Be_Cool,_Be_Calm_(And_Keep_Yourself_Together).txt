Whoo!
Girl I've been cryin' ever since you left
My mama told me get a hold of yourself
And be cool, calm and keep yourself together
She said be cool, calm and keep yourself together, ha ha ha, ha
Sugar plum you're really gold
And it just don't help to cry
So I wiped my tears away the other day
And strung my handkerchief up to dry
Then I changed my style puttin' on a smile
And went out to face the world
The smile I wear see, ha, I don't care that I just lost my girl
But I still get that old yearnin'
Can't be cool when my heart is burnin'
I still get that old feelin'
Can't be calm when my head is reelin'
I say mother dear see here, see here
Tell me now what shall I do
Can't have that girl and I love her true
She said when things give up be manly
Now to be cool, calm, and keep yourself together
That's what my mama said
Be cool, calm, and keep yourself together, ha ha
Sugar pie you said goodbye
And I cried myself to sleep
That's when my mother said don't lose your head son
It just don't help to weep
Now I'm the great pretender
I don't surrender to what I feel inside
I'm the life of the crowd, and ha, I left my blood
But it's all a fake disguise
'Cause I still hear my heart poundin'
Hard to be cool when you come around me
I still feel my heart purrin'
Hard to be calm when my insides stirrin'
I say mother dear see here, see here
Tell me now which way to go
Can't have that girl and I love her so
She said whenever you're blue, whatever you do
Be cool, calm, and keep yourself together
That's what my mama said
Be cool, calm, and keep yourself together
