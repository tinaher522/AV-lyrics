<song artist="Stevie_Wonder" title="Workout_Stevie,_Workout">
Every time I feel a little groove coming on
I just have to move, I got a tune I play
(Workout, Stevie, workout) I got a song I sing
(Workout, Stevie, workout) I got a dance I do
(Workout, Stevie, workout) You can do it, too
(Workout, Stevie, workout)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, I got a song I sing, yeah, yeah
(Workout, Stevie, workout)
I got a tune I play, yeah yeah
(Workout, Stevie, workout)
I got a dance I do, yeah
(Workout, Stevie, workout)
You can do it, too
(Workout, Stevie, workout)
You can do it, too.
You can do it, too.
(Workout, Stevie, workout)
You can do it if you wanna
(Workout, Stevie, workout)
You can do it, too.
(Workout, Stevie, workout)
(Workout, Stevie, workout)
Do you feel it? (yeah)
