<song artist="Stevie_Wonder" title="If_You_Really_Love_Me">
Well, if you really love me
Won't you tell me
(If you really love me
Won't you tell me)
And if you really love me
Won't you tell me, yeah
Then I won't have to be
Playin' around
You call my name, ooh, so sweet
To make your kissing complete
When your mood is clear
You quickly change your ways
Then you say I'm untrue
What am I supposed to do
Be a fool who sits alone
Waiting for you
But if you really love me
Won't you tell me
(If you really love me
Won't you tell me)
And if you really love me 
Won't you tell me, yeah
Then I won't have to be
Playin' around
I see the light of your smile
Calling me all the while
You are saying baby it's time to go
First the feeling's all right
Then it's gone from sight
So I've taken out this time to say
Whoa, oh, if you really love me 
Won't you tell me
(If you really love me 
Won't you tell me)
And if you really love me
Won't you tell me
Baby, tell me
Then I won't have to be
Playin' around
Let me know how you feeling
Oh, baby
