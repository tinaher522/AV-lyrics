(doo doo doo ooh)
Say yeah, yeah, yeah
Say yeah, yeah, yeah
One more time, now baby
Say yeah, yeah, yeah
Say yeah, yeah, yeah
I try to put my arms around you
All because I want to
Hold you tight
But every time I reach for you, baby
Try to kiss you
You just jump clean out of sight
Oh, I got plans for you
I tell you I've made plans for two
Guess I'm just a stubborn kind of fellow
Got my mind made up
To love you
Oh
Everybody say
Say yeah, yeah, yeah
Say yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh

I'm gonna love you
(gonna love you in every way)
In every way
(gonna love you in every way)
Ooh, I'm gonna love you
(gonna love you in every way)
In every way
(gonna love you in every way)
With other girls I've wanted
I've waited just a moment
With you I shall remain (by your side)
Oh, I know you've heard about me
Bad things about me
Baby, please let me explain
Oh, I have kissed a few
Tell you a few have kissed me too
I guess I'm just a stubborn kind of fellow
Got my mind made up
To love you
Oh ooh, everybody's saying
Say yeah, yeah, yeah
Say yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, everybody say
Say yeah, yeah, yeah
Say yeah, yeah, yeah
Aah, sing now everybody
Say yeah, yeah, yeah
Say yeah, yeah, yeah
For real, for real
Just sing everybody
Say yeah
Say yeah, yeah, yeah
Uh, huh, huh
I guess I'm a stubborn kind of fellow
Got my mind made up
To love you
You
Only you
