<song artist="Stevie_Wonder" title="Hello,_Young_Lovers">
Oh yeah
Hey, whoever you are
I want you to listen to my story
Yeah, yeah, yeah my story
While I tell you, mmm
Hello young lovers whoever you are
I hope your troubles are few
All of my good wishes go with you tonight
Yeah, I've been in love like you
Oh be brave young lovers, young lovers, and follow your star
Be brave, be faithful and true
You've got to cling to each other, very close tonight
I've been in love like you, hey
I've had a love of my own
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I've had a love of my own
I know how it feels, ha, to have wings on your heels
And fly down the street in a trance
You fly down the street on a chance that you'll meet
And you meet not really by chance
Don't cry young lovers, young lovers, yeah
Hey, hey, hey
Hey
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I've had a love of my own
Yeah, yeah
Be brave young lovers, be brave, brave, brave
