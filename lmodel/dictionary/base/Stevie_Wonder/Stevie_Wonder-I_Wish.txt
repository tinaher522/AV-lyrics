<song artist="Stevie_Wonder" title="I_Wish">
Lookin' back on when I was a little nappy headed boy
Then my only worry was for Christmas what would be my toy
Even though we sometimes would not get a thing
We were happy with the joy the day would bring
Sneaking out the back door to hang out with those hoodlum friends of mine
Greeted at the back door with, "Boy, thought I told you not to go outside!"
Tryin' your best to bring the water to your eyes
Thinkin' it might stop her from woopin' your behind
I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days e-ver have to go?
I wish those days could, come back once more
Why did those days e-ver have to go?
'Cause I love them so
Brother says he's tellin' 'bout you playin' doctor with that girl
Just don't tell, an' I'll give you anythin' you want in this whole wide world
Mama gives you money for Sunday school
You trade yours for candy, after church is through
Smokin' cigarettes, writing something nasty on the wall (You nasty boy!)
Teacher sends you to the principal's office down the hall
You grow up and learn that kinda thing ain't right
But while you were doin' it it sure felt outta sight
I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days e-ver have to go?
I wish those days could, come back once more
Why did those days e-ver have to go?
