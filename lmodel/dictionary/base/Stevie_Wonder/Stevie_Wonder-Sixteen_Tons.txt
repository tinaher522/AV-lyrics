<song artist="Stevie_Wonder" title="Sixteen_Tons">
Some folks say a man is made outta mud
But a poor man's made outta muscle and blood
Muscle and blood, skin and bones
A mind that's weak and a back that's strong
You load sixteen tons and what do you get
Another day older and deeper in debt
Saint Peter don't you call me 'cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store, yeah, ha
I was born when the sun didn't shine
I became a man who would work in the mine
I loaded sixteen tons of number nine coal
The foreman said, "Well, a-bless my soul"
I was born in drizzlin' rain
Fightin' and trouble was my middle name
When I come around, you better step aside
A lot of men didn't and a lot of men died, yes they did
You load sixteen tons and what do you get
Another day older and deeper in debt
Saint Peter don't you call me 'cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store
And hear you sing it one time with me
Sixteen tons and what do you get
Another day older and deeper in debt
Saint Peter don't you call me 'cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store
Everybody humming only
Mmm, hmm, ooh, ooh, yeah
Mmm, hmm, ooh, ooh
