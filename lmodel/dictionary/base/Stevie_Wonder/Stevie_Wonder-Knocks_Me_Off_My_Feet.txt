<song artist="Stevie_Wonder" title="Knocks_Me_Off_My_Feet">
I see us in the park
Strolling the summer days of imaginings in my head
And words from our hearts
Told only to the wind felt even without being said
I don't wanna bore you with my trouble
But there's somethin' bout your love
That makes me weak and
Knocks me off my feet
There's somethin' bout your love
That makes me weak and
Knocks me off ... my feet
Knocks me off my feet
I don't wanna bore you with it
Oh but I love you, I love you, I love you
I don't wanna bore you with it
Oh but I love you, I love you, I love you
More and more
We lay beneath the stars
Under a lovers tree that's seen through the eyes of my mind
I reach out for the part
Of me that lives in you that only our two hearts can find
But I don't wanna bore you with my trouble
But there's somethin' bout your love
That makes me weak and
Knocks me off my feet
There's somethin' bout your love
That makes me weak and
Knocks me off ... my feet
Knocks me off my feet
I don't wanna bore you with it
Oh but I love you, I love you, I love you
I don't wanna bore you with it
Oh but I love you, I love you, I love you (Repeat)
