<song artist="Stevie_Wonder" title="Ngiculela_(Es_Una_Historia)">
Ngiculela ikusasg
Ngliyacula nao thando
Ngicula ngelinyi langa
Uthando luyobusa
Jikelele kulomblada wethu
Es una historia de manana
Es una historia de amor
Es una historia que amor reinera
Por nuestro mundo
Es una historia de mi corazon
There are songs to make you smile
There are songs to make you sad
But with an happy song to sing
It never seems this bad
To me came this melody
So I've tried to put in words how I feel
Tomorrow will be for you and me
I am singing of tomorrow
I am singing of love
I am singing, someday love will reign
Throughout this world of ours
I am singing of love from the heart
Let's all sing, someday sweet love will reign
Throughout this world of ours
Let's start singing of love from our hearts
Let's start singing of love from our hearts
