<song artist="Stevie_Wonder" title="Bird_Of_Beauty">
Doo Doo Doo...
Simon says, that now your mind desires a vacation
Free to join, in fun and plenty recreation
There awaits, you a ticket at Please-have-a-good-time station
'Cause what is is gonna stay
'Til ole father time decides to change
Simon says, that your mind is requesting a furlough
Let it find, the answers to things that you always want to know
There's a tour of many places that you've always wanted, to go, yeah
And to me that sure sounds best
'Cause it means happiness, for you
There is so much in life for you to feel
Unfound in white, red, or yellow pills
A mind excursion can be such a thrill
You'll be satisfied
Take a chance and ride
The bird of beauty of the sky
Doo Doo Doo...
Tudo bem vocí deve descannar a sua mente
Não faz mal o qu vai acontecer daqui pra fente
Vai cantar alegria [Incomplete]
Voce coracao assim tao feliz ja vai cantar carnaval
Woah
There is so much in life for you to feel
Unfound in white, red, or yellow pills
A mind excursion can be such a thrill
You please satisfy
Take a chance and ride
The bird of beauty of the sky
Doo Doo Doo... 
The bird of beauty of the sky
