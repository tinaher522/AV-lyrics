<song artist="Stevie_Wonder" title="Lately">
Lately I have had the strangest feeling
With no vivid reason here to find
Yet the thought of losing you has been hanging
Round my mind
Far more frequently you're wearing perfume
With you say, no special place to go
But when I ask, 'Will you be coming back soon?'
You don't know, never know
Well, I'm a man of many wishes
I hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel
My eyes won't let me hide
'Cause they always start to cry
'Cause this time could mean goodbye
Lately I've been staring in the mirror
Very slowly picking me apart
Trying to tell myself I had no reason
With your heart
Just the other night while you were sleeping
I vaguely heard you whisper someone's name
But, when I ask you of the thoughts you're keeping
You just say, 'Nothing's changed'
Well, I'm a man of many wishes
I hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel
My eyes won't let me hide
'Cause they always start to cry
'Cause this time could mean goodbye, goodbye
Oh, I'm a man of many wishes
I hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel
My eyes won't let me hide
'Cause they always start to cry
'Cause this time could mean goodbye
