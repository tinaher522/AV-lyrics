<song artist="Stevie_Wonder" title="That's_What_Friends_Are_For">
And I never thought I'd feel this way 
And as far as I'm concerned 
I'm glad I got the chance to say 
That I do believe in magic
And if I should ever go away
Well just close your eyes and try
To feel the way we do today
And then if you can remember...
Keep smiling, keep shining
Knowing you can always count on me for sure
That's what friends are for
For good times, and bad times 
I'll be on your side forever-more
That's what friends are for
Well you came and opened me
And now there's so much more I see
And so by the way I thank you...oh
And then for the times when we're apart
Well then close your eyes and know
The words are coming from my heart
And if you can remember...oh
Keep smiling, keep shining
Knowing you can always count on me for sure
That's what friends are for
For good times, and bad times 
I'll be on your side forever-more
That's what friends are for
Keep smiling, keep shining
Knowing you can always count on me for sure
That's what friends are for
For good times, and bad times 
I'll be on your side forever-more
That's what friends are for
Keep smiling, keep shining
Knowing you can always count on me for sure
That's what friends are for
For good times, and bad times 
I'll be on your side forever-more
That's what friends are for
On me for sure, on me for sure, on me for sure, 
For thats what friends are for
