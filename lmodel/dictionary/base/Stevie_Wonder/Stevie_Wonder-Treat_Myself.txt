<song artist="Stevie_Wonder" title="Treat_Myself">
There's a place I can go
When the tension's high and I'm feeling low
In a falsh I can be in an another space
As a different me, have a new id.
I think I'll treat myself to all the pretty places in my head
Yes, I'm going to treat myself to all the pretty places in my head
There's no rich, there's no poor
Everything is love, no such word as "war"
There's no black and no white
Rainbow colors they, dress the days and nights, life's a paradise
I think I'll treat myself to all the pretty places in my head
Yes, I'm going to treat myself to all the pretty places in my head
Its amazing how the mind
Can do what you want it to
It can take you to a time
Where you'll want to stay forever
Feeling everlasting pleasure
If your life's in a place
That you can hardly bare
Come along with me to mental ecstasy
I think I'll treat myself to all the pretty places in my head
Yes, I'm going to treat myself to all the pretty places in my head
I think I'll treat myself to all the pretty places in my head
Yes, I'm going to treat myself to all the pretty places in my head
(backgrounds) whatsoever things are lovely
Whatsoever things are pure
Whatsoever things are honest
Whatsoever things are true
Whatsoever things are true
