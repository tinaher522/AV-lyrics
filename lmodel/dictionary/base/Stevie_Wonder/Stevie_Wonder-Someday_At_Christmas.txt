<song artist="Stevie_Wonder" title="Someday_At_Christmas">
Someday at Christmas, men won't be boys
Playing with bombs like kids play with toys
One warm December, our hearts will see
A world where men are free
Someday at Christmas, there'll be no wars
When we have learned what Christmas is for
When we have found what life's really worth
There'll be peace on Earth
Someday all our dreams will come to be
Someday in a world, where men are free
Maybe not in time for you and me
But someday at Christmas time
Someday at Christmas, we'll see a land
With no hungry children, no empty hands
One happy morning, people will share
A world where people care
Someday at Christmas, there'll be no tears
Where all men are equal and no man has fears
One shiney moment while on our way
From our world today
Someday all our dreams will come to be
Someday in a world where men are free
Maybe not in time for you and me
But someday at Christmas time
Someday at Christmas, men will not care
Hate will be gone and love will prevail
Someday a new world that we can start
With hope in every heart
Someday all are dreams will come to be
Someday in a world where men are free
Maybe not in time for you and me
But someday at Christmas time
Someday at Christmas time
