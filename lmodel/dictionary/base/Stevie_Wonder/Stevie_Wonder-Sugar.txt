<song artist="Stevie_Wonder" title="Sugar">
Sugar, Sugar
How I wanna be your main boy
Sugar, Sugar
How I wanna be your play toy
Got no time for every woman
Thinking that she's looking fine
Got no pockets full of money, no, no, no
A fox would just be wasting her time
All I got is good, good lovin'
Yeah, good loving is hard to find, hey
Sugar, Sugar
How I wanna be your main boy
Sugar, Sugar
How I wanna be your play toy
Get it baby
Ehh
Mmm hmm yeah
Got no need for fancy places
Got no need for cannon and wine, ah
Got no need to move to the city, no, no, no
Got no need to walk the line
All I need is good home cooking
And some sugar after supper time, hey
Sugar, Sugar
How I wanna be your main boy
Sugar, Sugar
How I wanna be your play toy
Ohh sugar
Ohh sugar
Ooohhhooohhhooohhh sugar
Ohh sugar
Ohh sugar
Ooh, oh yeah
Sugar
Sugar
Sugar, oh yeah
Sugar, oh yeah
