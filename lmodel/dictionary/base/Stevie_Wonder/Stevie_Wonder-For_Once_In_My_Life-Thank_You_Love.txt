<song artist="Stevie_Wonder" title="For_Once_In_My_Life-Thank_You_Love">
For once in my life I have someone who needs me
Someone Ive needed so long
For once, unafraid, I can go where life leads me
And somehow I know Ill be strong
For once I can touch what my heart used to dream of
Long before I knew
Someone warm like you
Would make my dreams come true
For once in my life I wont let sorrow hurt me
Not like it hurt me before
For once, I have something I know wont desert me
Im not alone anymore
For once, I can say, this is mine, you cant take it
As long as I know I have love, I can make it
For once in my life, I have someone who needs me
