<song artist="Stevie_Wonder" title="Until_You_Come_Back_To_Me">
Though you don't call anymore
I sit and wait in vain
I guess I'll rap on your door
Tap on your window pane
I want to tell you, baby
The changes I've been going through
Missing you
Until you come back to me
That's what I'm gonna do
Why did you have to decide
You had to set me free
I'm gonna swallow my pride
I'm gonna beg you to please see me
I'm gonna walk by myself
To prove that my love is true
Oh, for you 
Until you come back to me
That's what I'm gonna do
Living for you, my dear
Is like living in a world
Of constant fear
In my plea, I've got to make you see
That our love is dying
Although your phone you ignore
Somehow I must explain
I'll have to rap on your door
Tap on your window pane
I'm gonna camp on your steps
Until I get through to you
Change your view
Until you come back to me
That's what I'm gonna do
'Till you come back to me
That's what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna tap on your window pane
Don't wanna wait in vain
I'm gonna tap on your window pane
