<song artist="Stevie_Wonder" title="The_Lonesome_Road">
Look down, look down
That lonesome road
Before you travel on
Look up, look up
And see your maker
Before Gabriel blows his horn
Weary toting such a heavy load
Tredging down that long lonesome road
Look down, look down
Look down that lonesome road
Before you travel on
(True love, true love) True love, true love
(What have I done) Tell me what have I done
(Yeah) That you should treat me so
(Mmm, the pain you've caused) You caused me, yes you caused me
(To walk and talk) To walk and talk
(Yeah, yeah) Like I never did before
(Don't you get weary sometimes) Weary toting such a heavy load
(Gotta keep on moving) Tredging down that
Long (long), long (long), lonesome road (whoo)
Look down (look down), look down (look down) that
Look down that lonesome road
Before (before) you travel on (you travel on)
(Somebody help us now) Before you travel on
(Give another warning Stevie) Before you travel on
