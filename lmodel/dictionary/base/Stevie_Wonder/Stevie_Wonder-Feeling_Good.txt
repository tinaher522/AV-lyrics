<song artist="Stevie_Wonder" title="Feeling_Good">
Birds flying high, you know how I feel
Sun of the sky, you know how I feel
Reeds drifting by, you know how I feel
It's a new dawn
A new day
A new life for me
Don't you know I feel good
I feel alright
Fish in the sea, you know how I feel
River running free, you know just how I feel
Blossoms on a tree, hey you know how I feel
It's a new dawn
A new day
A new life for me
Don't you know I feel good
I feel alright
Dragonflies out in the sun, you know what I mean
Butterflies having fun, you know what I mean
Sleep in peace when day is done, that's what I mean
This whole world
Is a new world
In a bold world for me
I feel good
Stars when you shine, you know how I feel
Scent of the pine, you know just how I feel
Freedom is mine, that's how I feel
It's a new dawn
A new day
A new life for me
Don't you know I feel good
Feel alright
Uptight
Everybody clap your hands
Let me hear you clap your hands
I feel alright baby
Feel alright
