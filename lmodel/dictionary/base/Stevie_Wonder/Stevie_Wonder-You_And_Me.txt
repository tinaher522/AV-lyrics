<song artist="Stevie_Wonder" title="You_And_Me">
Ooh baby
Yeah, yeah, ooh baby
My sweet baby
Ha, ha
Ha
You and me, eternally
You and me, we're a reality
Piece of mind others are searching for
End of the vine, we had it all the time
So in love that's how we live
Never take, darling we always give
Happiness is every day
But it never would be if it wasn't fro you lovin' me
I was lost like a rolling stone I had to roll
As if I knew, in time I'd find my way to you
Here I am in a paradise that's good for two
It's good enough for me, it's good enough for you, ah
(You and me, eternally)
(You and me, we're a reality)
(Piece of mind others are searhcing for)
(End of the vine, we had it all the time)
One more thing I wanna say
I'll sacrifice day and night, to keep me that wife
One more thing I forgot to say
I blessed to be I find 'cause I build my world around you, ah
You and me, eternally
You and me, we're a reality
Piece of mind others are searching for
End of the vine, we had it all the time
Hey, so in love that's how we live
Never take, darling we always give
Happiness is every single day
But it never would be, baby, if it wasn't for you lovin' me
