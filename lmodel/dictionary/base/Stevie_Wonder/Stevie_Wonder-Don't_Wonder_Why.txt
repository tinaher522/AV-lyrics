<song artist="Stevie_Wonder" title="Don't_Wonder_Why">
Ooh
You never see the little sparkle in my eye
I wonder why
Sometimes I wish you'd stop and hold me, but you pass right by
I wonder why
I've tried everything I could
I even change my walk, the way that I stood
But you pass by me and pretend that you don't even see me
But I want you to know, mmm
If one day you decide to smile and say hello and I say goodbye, mmm
Don't wonder why, my baby
Don't wonder why, my baby
When I think of how you hurt me, it brings the tears
To my eyes
I just can't seem to make you happy, no matter how hard I try
I wonder why
Seems like no matter what I do
It's never good enough for you
My pain, it shows loud, but it still can't let go now
But I want you to know now
Nights grow old and winds blow cold and so old
If my loves grows cold and I don't wonder why my baby
Don't wonder why, oh yeah
Yeah, seems like no matter what I do
I'm never, never, never, never, never good enough for you
My pain it shows now oh you know I still just no matter I just can't let go now
But I want you to know
Nights grow old and winds blow cold, and so old, if my love grows cold
And I don't wonder why, baby
No, no, no, no, don't wonder why, my baby
Baby don't wonder why, don't wonder why, my baby
Don't wonder why, my baby
No, no, no, no don't wonder why my baby, ooh
Don't wonder why my baby
Can you hear me? Can you hear me?
