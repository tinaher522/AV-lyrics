Sunshine In Their Eyes
A lonesome fear
A hungry face
A barren pain
A dream unchased
Oh I can't wait untill the day there's sunshine in their eyes
A prayer is heard
By one so small
Let love be in the
Hearts of all
Oh I can't wait untill there's sunshine in their eyes
You and I may never see them cry
Or wonder why the world's so cold
You feel that they're too young
To take a look around
But in their faces I can see the trouble all around
Today we must turn into lies
The truth already in their minds
Oh I can't wait untill the day there's sunshine in their eyes
He can't wait untill the day there's sunshine in their eyes
OOOO sunshine
Oh I can't wait untill the day there's sunshine in their eyes
Sunshine in our eyes
