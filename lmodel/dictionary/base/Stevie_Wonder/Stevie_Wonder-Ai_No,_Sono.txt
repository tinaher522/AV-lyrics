<song artist="Stevie_Wonder" title="Ai_No,_Sono">
There is a garden
Where every heart can
Share in the joy of giving
It like no other
Has love to cover
Bearing no price on living
Quietty listen and you might hear them singing their lullaby
Calling for you to join in their love filled garden
Kibo-ni afure
ikiru yorokobi
Shiawase ni michi te
Ai no rakuen
Subete no kokoro ga
Ai o wakachiau
Shizuka ni mimi katamuke yo
Ai no komori uta
Kimi sasoi yobikakenu
Ai no sono
