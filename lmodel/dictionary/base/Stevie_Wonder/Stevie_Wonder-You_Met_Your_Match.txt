<song artist="Stevie_Wonder" title="You_Met_Your_Match">
Hey, you were good at playing the fox, girl
When I was good you threw me a bone
But I ain't playing hound for nobody
Girl, just wait 'til I get you home
I'll show you the way to love somebody
Like you've never ever been shown
'Cause my love light's burning
My whole life's yearning for you
Hey baby, you played around with Jimmy and Freddie
You tried to make me look like a fool
But I took care of Cindy and Suzie
Just to show you I can be twice as cruel, babe
If you want to learn how to love me
I'll teach you in my own private school
'Cause my love light's burning
My whole life's yearning for you
You met your match when you played with my affection
You met your match when you tried to make me walk the line
You met your match when you decided you would hurt me
That's when your grape fell from the vine
Your mama told me that I'd better be mellow
She said you're just a baby, maybe too green
I told her Jimmy, Freddie, Teddy and Big Joe
They knew better, Mama shake off that dream
Hey, I told her that you really were cooking
My love is burning, while I'm turning to steam
Hey, 'cause my love light's burning
My whole life's yearning for you
You met your match when you told me that you loved me
You met your match when you told me that you wouldn't let go, baby
You met your match, you met your match, you met your match, you met your match, you met your match
You met your match, baby
You met your match, you met your match, you met your match, you met your match, you met your match
You met your match, baby
