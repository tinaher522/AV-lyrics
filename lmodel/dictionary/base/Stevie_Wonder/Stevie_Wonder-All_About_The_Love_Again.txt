<song artist="Stevie_Wonder" title="All_About_The_Love_Again">
What if someone made a soda that caused everyone to love each other,
Mmm, Oh Yea,
That sounds so good to me,
And if just a tiny pill could make us see that we're truly sisters and brothers,
Mmm, Oh Yea,
That sounds so nice to me,
And we would have no time to waste on trivial things like war and pain,
Cause we'd be filled with joy to know through love the universe we changed.....to being
All about the love again,
All about the love my friend,
This whole world would be all about the love again,
We'd be all about the love again,
No need to pretend,
This whole world would be all about the love again
What if someone came up with a lotion that made everybody start sharing,
Mmm, Oh Yea,
That sounds so good to me,
And some irresistable cologne that with one spray we'd have no second thought of caring,
Mmm, Oh Yea,
Essence is on point to me,
And gone forever would be the days of hungr,
Homelessness and shame,
Cause over every single heart the promise of endless love would reign.....we'd be
All about the love again,
All about the love my friend,
This whole world would be all about the love again,
We'd be all about the love again,
No need to pretend,
This whole world would be all about the love again,
We'd be all about the love again,
All about the love my friend,
This whole universe would all about the love again,
We'd be all about the love again,
No need to pretend,
This whole world would be about the God's again
