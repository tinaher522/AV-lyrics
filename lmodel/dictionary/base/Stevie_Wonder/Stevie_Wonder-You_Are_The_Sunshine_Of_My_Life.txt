<song artist="Stevie_Wonder" title="You_Are_The_Sunshine_Of_My_Life">
You are the sunshine of my life
That's why I'll always be around
You are the apple of my eye
Forever you'll stay in my heart
I feel like this is the beginning
Though I've loved you for a million years
And if I thought our love was ending
I'd find myself drowning in my own tears
You are the sunshine of my life, yeah
That's why I'll always stay around, mmm yeah yeah
You are the apple of my eye
Forever you'll stay in my heart
You must have known that I was lonely
Because you came to my rescue
And I know that this must be heaven
How could so much love be inside of you?
You are the sunshine of my life, yeah
That's why I'll always stay around, mmm yeah yeah
You are the apple of my eye (Love has joined us)
Forever you'll stay in my heart (Love has joined us)
Yeah, you are the sunshine of my life, baby (Love has joined us)
That's why I'll always stay around (Love has joined us)...(fade)
