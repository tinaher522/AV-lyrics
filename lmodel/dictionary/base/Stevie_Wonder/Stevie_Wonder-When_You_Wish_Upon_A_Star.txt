<song artist="Stevie_Wonder" title="When_You_Wish_Upon_A_Star">
When a star is born
They possess a gift or two
One of them is this
They have the power
To make a dream come true
When you wish upon a star
Makes no difference who you are
Anything your heart desires
Will come to you
Now if your heart is in your dreams
No request is too extreme
When you wish upon a star
As dreamers do
Fate is kind
She brings to those who love
The sweet fulfillment of
Their secret longing, oh yeah
Like a bolt out of the blue
Fate steps in and sees you through
When you wish upon a star
Your dreams come true
When you wish upon a star
