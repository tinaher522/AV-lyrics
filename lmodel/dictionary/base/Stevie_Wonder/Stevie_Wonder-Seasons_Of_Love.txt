<song artist="Stevie_Wonder" title="Seasons_Of_Love">
Five hundred twenty five thousand six hundred minutes
Five hundred twenty five thousand moments so dear
Five hundred twenty five thousand six hundred minutes
How do you measure, measure a year?
In daylights, in sunsets, in midnights, in cups of coffee
In inches, in miles, in laughter, in strife
In five hundred twenty five thousand six hundred minutes
How do you measure a year in a life?
How about, love?
How about, love?
How about, love?
Measure in love
Seasons of love
Seasons of love
Five hundred twenty five thousand six hundred minutes
Five hundred twenty five thousand journeys to plan
Five hundred twenty five thousand six hundred minutes
How do you measure a life of a woman or a man?
In truths that she learned
Or in times that he cried
In bridges he burned
Or the way that she died
It's time now, to sing out
Though the story never ends
Let's celebrate, remember a year in a life, of friends
Remember the love
(Oh, you gotta remember the love)
Remember the love
(Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Remember the love
'Member, sing out, give out, measure your life
Measure in love, measure in love
Measure in love, measure in love
Measure in love, ohh
Seasons of love
Seasons of love
Seasons of love
Seasons of love
In diapers, report cards
In spoke wheels, in speeding tickets
In contracts, dollars
In funerals, in births
Five hundred twenty-five thousand six hundred minutes
How do you figure a last year on earth?
How do you figure a last year on earth?
(Seasons of love)
How do you figure a last year on earth?
Five hundred twenty-five thousand six hundred minutes
How do you figure a last year on earth?
Seasons of love
