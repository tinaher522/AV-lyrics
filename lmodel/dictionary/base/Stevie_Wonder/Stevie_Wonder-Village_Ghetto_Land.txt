<song artist="Stevie_Wonder" title="Village_Ghetto_Land">
Would you like to go with me down my dead end street?
Would you like to come with me to Village Ghetto Land?
See the people lock their doors while robbers laugh and steal
Beggars watch and eat their meals from garbage cans
Broken glass is everywhere, it's a bloody scene
Killing plagues the citizens unless they own police
Children play with rusted cars, sores cover their hands
Politicians laugh and drink, drunk to all demands
Families buying dog food now, starvation roams the streets
Babies die before they're born, infected by the grief
Now some folks say that we should be glad for what we have
Tell me, would you be happy in Village Ghetto Land?
Village Ghetto Land
