<song artist="Stevie_Wonder" title="Have_A_Talk_With_God">
There are people who have let the problems of today
Lead them to conclude that for them life is not the way
But every problem has an answer and if yours you cannot find
You should talk it over to him
He'll give you peace of mind
When you feel your life's too hard
Just go have a talk with God
Many of us feel we walk alone without a friend
Never communicating with the one who lives within
Forgetting all about the one who never ever lets you down
And you can talk to him anytime, he's always around
When you feel your life's too hard
Just go have a talk with God
Yeah...
Dum le dum...
Well he's the only free psychiatrist that's known throughout the world
For solving the problems of all men, women, little boys and girls
When you feel your life's too hard
Just go have a talk with God
When you feel your life's too hard
Just go have a talk with God
When your load's too much to bear
Just go talk to God, he cares (I know he does)
When you feel your life's too hard
Just go have a talk with God
Thank you (Thank you very much)
