Hey there miss fine, sweet little clinging vine
Your actions kind of show me you love me truly, yeah
You're warmer than July, sweet as apple pie
I can't let you know you're getting to me
Yeah, 'cause you can't judge a book by it's cover
My papa used to say, "Look child,
Look beyond a tender smile.
'Cause can't judge a look by it's lover."
Girl, I'm sweet on you though you can't see through
This unconcerned expression I've been wearing
Hey, I practice looking bored so you can feel ignored
But that don't mean that I'm not really caring
Yeah, 'cause you can't judge a book by it's cover
And you can't judge a look by it's lover
Maybe my coldness is a mask, maybe your loving ways will last
But can't judge a book by it's cover
Somewhere beyond the skin, somewhere deep within (somewhere, somewhere)
We may find that love is there to test us, yeah
But we've got to have the nerve to give it all it deserves
And maybe, baby,  we'll find something precious, yeah
'Cause you can't judge a book by it's cover
Only time it's gonna show, only time will let us know
'Cause you can't judge a book by it's cover, baby, ooh
And you can't judge a look by it's lover
We've got to search each other's minds
We've got to read between the lines
Oh, take a different look
And make our hearts an open book
Oh, you can't judge a book by it's cover
No, no, no, no
And you can't judge a look by it's lover
