<song artist="Stevie_Wonder" title="Teach_Me_Tonight">
Did you say I've got a lot to learn
Well don't think I'm trying not to learn
Since this is a perfect spot to learn
Come on teach me tonight
Starting with the ABC of it (A, B, C)
Right down to the XYZ of it (X, Y, Z)
Help me solve the mystery of it
Whoa, I wanna be taught tonight
Because the sky's a blackboard high above me
If a shooting star goes by
I'll use that star to write, "I love you"
A thousand times across the sky
One thing isn't very clear my love, yeah
Should that teacher stand so near my love (ah ah yeah)
Graduation's almost here now love
Come on teach me tonight (ah ah yeah)
Hey now, come on fellas (come on fellas)
Ah ha ha yeah (teach me tonight)
Ah ah ah, yeah yeah yeah (Yeah yeah yeah)
Come on teach me tonight, yeah
'Cause the sky's a blackboard high above me
And if a shooting star goes by
I'll use that star to write, "I love you"
A thousand times across the sky
One thing isn't very clear, Stevie
Should a teacher stand so near (oh no)
Graduation's almost here and I
I wanna be taught tonight
Hey, come on baby, yeah yeah yeah
Come one teach me tonight (yes I will)
Ha ha, baby baby baby, yeah
Come one teach me tonight, yeah
I want you to teach me (hey, teach me)
Hey now, teach me, teach me (teach me)
Teach me (teach me)
Teach me baby (yeah yeah)
Yeah (Ah ah on it)
Yeah (ah ah yeah)
Teach me (yeah)
