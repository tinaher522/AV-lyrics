<song artist="Stevie_Wonder" title="Stay_Gold">
Seize ... upon the moment of long ago
One breath away and there you will be
So young and carefree, again you will see
That place in time
So gold
Steal ... away into that way back when
You thought that all would last forever
But like the weather, nothing can ever
And be in time
Stay gold
But can it be ... when we can see
So vividly a memory
And yes you say so must the day
To fade away
And leave a ray of sun
So gold
Life ... is but a twinkling of an eye
Yet filled with sorrow and compassion
Though not imagined, all things that happen
Will age too old
Though gold
Stay gold
