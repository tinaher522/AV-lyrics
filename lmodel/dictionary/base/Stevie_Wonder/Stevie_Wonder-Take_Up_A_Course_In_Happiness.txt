<song artist="Stevie_Wonder" title="Take_Up_A_Course_In_Happiness">
When life reaches out and takes you
On an unpleasent ride
And your bridge of dreams comes
Tumblin' down
Don't let your bed of sorrow
Ever conquer your pride
Remember there's always a way out
Just take up a course in happiness
Take up a course to clear out your mind
You will show yourself how to smile
Take up a course in happiness
Take up a free instruction in life
You will learn how to smile
And when your optimism
Has a set back or two
And you feel all your tryin's in vain
(Your heart's in the rain)
Don't give up the hope that's due you
Just to study your doubt
Remember there's always a way out
Just take up a course in happiness
Take up a course to clear out your mind
You will show yourself how to smile
Take up a course in happiness
Take up a free instruction in life
You will learn how to smile
