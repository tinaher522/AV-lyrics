<song artist="Stevie_Wonder" title="Don't_You_Worry_'Bout_A_Thing">
See dig, mama, uh, do ya understand that? 
(No)
Well uh, like, I can understand how you can't, because I've been uh,
You know, Paris, Beirut, you know, I mean Iraq, Iran, "Ukraingia", you know
I speak very very um, fluent Spanish
Ah, todo 'sta bien, chévere, you understand that? 
(Chévere?)
Chevere, bien chevere, is that right mama?
'Cause I've got my shaky...
Everybody's got a thing
But some don't know how to handle it
Always reachin' out in vain
Just taking the things not worth having
But don't you worry 'bout a thing
Don't you worry 'bout a thing, mama
'Cause I'll be standing on the side
When you check it out
They say your style of life's a drag
And that you must go other places
But just don't you feel too bad
When you get fooled by smiling faces but
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
Don't you worry 'bout a thing, mama
Cause I'll be standing on the side
When you check it out
When you get off ... your trip
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
Don't you worry 'bout a thing, mama
'Cause I'll be standing in the side
When you check it out
When you get off ... your trip
Everybody needs a change
A chance to check out the new
But you're the only one to see
The changes you take yourself through
But don't you worry 'bout a thing
Don't you worry 'bout a thing, pretty mama
'Cause I'll be standing in the wings
When you check it out
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
(To do 'sta bien chévere)
