<song artist="Stevie_Wonder" title="We_Can_Work_It_Out">
Try to see things my way
Do I have to keep on talking till I can't go on? (hey)
While you see it your way
Run the risk of knowing that our love may soon be gone
We can work it out
We can work it out
Think of what you're saying (hey)
You can get it wrong and still you think that it's alright (hey)
Think of what I'm saying (hey)
We can work it out and get it straight, or say goodnight
We can work it out
We can work it out
Life is very short and there's no time
For fussing and fighting, my friend (hey)
I have always thought that it's a crime
So I will ask you once again (hey)
Try to see things my way (hey)
Only time will tell if I am right or I am wrong
While you see it your way (hey)
There's a chance that we may fall apart before too long
We can work it out
We can work it out
(Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, hey)
(We can work it out)
(Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, hey)
(We can work it out)
Try to see things my way (hey)
Only time will tell if I am right or I am wrong (hey)
While you see it your way (hey)
There's a chance that we may fall apart before too long
We can work it out
We can work it out
Think of what you're saying (hey)
You can get it wrong and still you think that it's alright (hey)
Think of what I'm saying (hey)
We can work it out and get it straight, or say goodnight
(Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, hey)
(We can work it out)
(Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, hey)
(We can work it out)
(Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, hey)
(We can work it out)
(Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, hey)
(We can work it out)
