<song artist="Stevie_Wonder" title="Supersition">
Very superstitious writing's on the wall
Very superstitious ladders 'bout to fall
Thirteen month old baby broke the lookin' glass
Seven years of bad luck, the good things in your past
When you believe in things that you don't understand
Then you suffer, superstition ain't the way, yeah yeah
Very superstitious, wash your face and hands
Rid me go the problem, do all that you can
Keep me in a daydream, keep me goin' strong
You don't wanna save me, sad is my song
When you believe in things you don't understand
Then you suffer, superstition ain't the way, yeah yeah
Very superstitious, nothin' more to say
Very superstitious, the devil's on his way
Thirteen month old baby broke the lookin' glass
Seven years of bad luck, good things in your past
When you believe in things that you don't understand
Then you suffer, superstition ain't the way, no, no, no
