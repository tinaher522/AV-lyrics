<song artist="Stevie_Wonder" title="Signed,_Sealed,_Delivered_I'm_Yours">
Hah, hey, oh yeah baby
Like a fool I went and stayed too long
Now I'm wondering if your love's still strong
Ooh baby, here I am
Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours, mmm
Then that time I went and said goodbye
Now I'm back and not ashamed to cry
Ooh baby, here I am
Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours, ah
Here I am baby, oh (signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours)
You got my future in your hands
Here I am baby (signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours)
You got my future in your hands, hey
I've done a lot of foolish things
That I really didn't mean, ah
Yeah, yeah, didn't I, woah baby
Seen a lot of things in this old world
When I touch them, they mean nothing, girl
Ooh baby, here I am
Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours, oh, I'm yours
Ooh, baby, you set my soul on fire
That's why I know you're my heart's only desire
Ooh baby, here I am
Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours, ah
Here I am baby, woah (signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours)
You got my future in your hands, ah
Here I am baby, I  (signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours)
You got my future in your hands, baby
I've done a lot of foolish things
That I really didn't mean
I could be a broken a man, but here I am
Here I am baby  (signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours)
Ah, here I am baby
Here I am baby  (signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours)
Get it, get it, get it, get it
Here I am baby  (signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours)
Yeah, baby
