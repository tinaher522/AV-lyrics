<song artist="Stevie_Wonder" title="Smile">
Smile, though your heart is aching
Smile, even though it's breaking
When there are clouds in the sky, you'll get by
If you smile through all fear and sorrow
Smile, it may be tomorrow
You'll find the sun comes shining through for you
(Find the sun comes shining through)
Light up your face with gladness
Hide every trace of sadness
Although a tear may be ever so near
That's the time you must keep on trying
Smile, what's the use of crying
You'll find that life is still worthwhile
If you just smile
(Light up your face with gladness)
Light up your face with gladness
(Hide every trace of sadness)
Hide of trace of sadness
(Although a tear may be ever so near)
Although a tear may be ever so near
Now that's the time you must keep on trying
Smile, what's the use of crying
You'll find that life is still worthwhile
If you just smile
(Smile, though your heart is aching)
Smile
(Smile)
Smile
