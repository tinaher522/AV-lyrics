<song artist="Stevie_Wonder" title="Seed's_A_Star-Tree_Medley">
We're a people black as is your night
Born to spread Amma's eternal light
Which since time began
Has been to bring truth to every man
Our ancestors have since long ago
Passed their wisdom down so we to know
For here lies the key
That will help unfold the mistery
A seed's a star
A seed's a star's a seed
A star's a seed
A star's a seed's a star
In myself I do contain
The elements of sun and rain
First a seed with roots that swell
I gradually burst through my shell
Pushing down into the ground
The root of me is homeward bound
A trunk, a leaf and there I am
A miracle of least by far
Tree, you are the longest living one we know
The largest of all plants and still you grow
Tree, within your branches there's such history
So much of what we're searching for to know
Every fifty years we celebrate
Po Tolo, our star, as it rotates
Though infinitely small
It is still the heaviest of them all
A seed's a star
A seed's a star's a seed
A star's a seed
A star's a seed's a star
A seed's a star
A seed's a star's a seed
A star's a seed
A star's a seed's a star
Ye Lolo De Ye
Lolo Ye Kesse De Ye
Kesse ye lolo De Ye
Lolo Ye Kesse De Ye
Kesse ye lolo De Ye
Lolo Ye Kesse De Ye
Kesse ye lolo De Ye
Lolo Ye Kesse De Ye
And some believe antennas are their leaves
That spans beyond our galaxy
They've been, they are and probably will be
Who are the mediocrity
