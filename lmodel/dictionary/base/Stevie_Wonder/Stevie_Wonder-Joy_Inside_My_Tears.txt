<song artist="Stevie_Wonder" title="Joy_Inside_My_Tears">
I've always come to the conclusion that 'but' is the way
Of asking for permission to lay something heavy on ones head
So I have tried to not be the one who'll fall into that line
But what I feel inside I think you should know
And baby that's you - you - you
Made life's history
Cause you've brought some joy inside my tears
And you have done what no one thought could be
You've brought some joy inside my tears
I've always felt that tomorrow is for those who are too much afraid
To go past yesterday and start living for today
I feel that lasting moments are coming far and few between
So I should tell you of the happiness that you bring
Baby, baby it's you - you - you
Made life's history
Oh baby, you've brought some joy inside my tears
You have done what no one thought could be
You brought some joy inside my tears
You brought some joy inside my tears
You brought some joy inside my tears
You've brought some joy inside my tears
You have done what no one thought could be
You brought some joy inside my tears
You - you - you, made life's history
You brought some joy inside my tears
You have done what no one thought could be
You brought some joy inside my tears
You brought some joy inside my tears
