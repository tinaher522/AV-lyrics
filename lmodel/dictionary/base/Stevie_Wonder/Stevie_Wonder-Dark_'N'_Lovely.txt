<song artist="Stevie_Wonder" title="Dark_'N'_Lovely">
There is a place
On heart's motherland
Where a people
Die in bantu stands
Manchild at eight
Will face guns of hate
Womanchild's fate
Is life second rate
Just because they're dark 'n' lovely
Just because they're dark 'n' lovely
They do a dance
Called Mbaqana jive
Rainbow people
Dancin' to stay alive
After hours
Party hand in hand
After Shebeen
Terror strikes again
Just because they're dark 'n' lovely
Just because they're dark 'n' lovely
Just because they're dark 'n' lovely
Dark 'n' lovely
The whole planet's watchin'
And the Sun God is watchin', too
Hey there Botha
Yes, we are watcin' you
Spirits can do
Jah will stop this reign
Watch our world turn
To help those in pain
Just because they're dark 'n' lovely
Just because they're dark 'n' lovely
Just because they're dark 'n' lovely
Just because they're dark 'n' lovely
Dark 'n' lovely Dark 'n' lovely
