<song artist="Stevie_Wonder" title="Hold_Me">
Hold me darling hold me
And I'll always be your, be your guy 
Closer, baby come closer 
Let me be the one you love and be right here by your side 
Why should you be lonely when I need you so?
Give my arms a chance I know I'll never let go
So hold me, baby hold me
Say you'll never let me go
Why should you be lonely when I need you so?
Give my arms a chance I know I'll never let go
So hold me, baby hold me
Say you'll never let me go
You know I love you so (I'll never-never let you go)
I'll never let you go (Oh baby-baby, hold me)
Why should we be apart (I'll never-never let you go)
