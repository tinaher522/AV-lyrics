<song artist="Stevie_Wonder" title="Expressions_Of_Love">
How would it be,
If you and me, through our love,
Could improve the world?
How would it be if we would see with our hearts?
It would be sweet expression of love.
How does it feel
When you reveal to someone that they've found a friend?
How does it feel when someone whispers your name?
Feels like a sweet expression of love
Expressions of love
Can't deny even when we're saying goodbye
And just when it feels as if love's at an end
It comes back again like the sun in spring
That's the way of everything.
Here's to hope andâ?¦
Expressions of love can't deny
Even when we're saying goodbye
And just when it feels as if love's at an end
It comes back again like the sun in spring
That's the way of everything
Here's to hope and timeâ?¦
