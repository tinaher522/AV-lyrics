<song artist="Stevie_Wonder" title="Uptight_(Everything's_Alright)">
Baby, everything is all right
Uptight, out of sight
Baby, everything is all right
Uptight, out of sight
I'm a poorman's son from across the railroad tracks
The only shirt I own is hangin' on my back
But I'm the envy of every single guy
Since I'm the apple of my girl's eye
When we go out stepping on the town for a while
My money's low and my suit's out of style
But it's all right if my clothes aren't new
Out of sight, because my heart is true
She says baby, everything is all right
Uptight, out of sight
Baby, everything is all right
Uptight, clean out of sight
She's a pearl of a girl
I guess that's what you might say 
I guess her folks brought her up that way 
The right side of the tracks she was born and raised 
In a great big old house full of butlers and maids
She says no one is better than I 
And I know I'm just an average guy 
No footfall hero or smooth Don Juan 
Got empty pockets you see, I'm a poor man's son
Can't give her the things that money can buy
But I'll never, never never make my baby cry 
And it's all right, what if I can't do 
Out of sight, because my heart is true 
She says baby everything is all right 
Uptight, clean out of sight 
Baby, everything is all right 
Uptight, clean out of sight
Baby everything is all right 
Uptight, clean out of sight 
Baby, everything is all right 
Uptight, way out of sight
