<song artist="Stevie_Wonder" title="To_Feel_The_Fire">
My outer self looks happy as can be
A perfect dream love as clear as all can see
But just like that, real, has hit me suddenly
My outer is a liar
Cause when I look inside my heart and I tell the truth to me
Loud and clear my soul cries out with total honesty
I need the fire, fire, fire to keep me warm
I got to feel the fire
My smiling face, with laughter on the side
You'd say no doubt I get passion every night
But if in our bed your arms don't hold me tight
Means it leaves much to be desired
Cause when I look inside my heart and I tell the truth to me
Loud and clear my soul cries out with total honesty
I need the fire, fire, fire to keep me warm
I got to feel the fire
And if you look into my eyes and you told yourself the truth
You can't make a body hot if you don't light the fuse
I need your fire, fire, fire to keep me warm
I got to feel the fire
It don't take a rocket scientist to know
That if you don't fan the flame then the fire will eventually go
Cause when I look inside my heart and I tell the truth to me
Loud and clear my soul cries out with total honesty
I need the fire, fire, fire to keep me warm
I got to feel the fire
Cause when I look inside my heart and I tell the truth to me
Loud and clear my soul cries out with total honesty
I need your fire, fire, fire to keep me warm
I got to feel the fire
I need the fire, fire, fire to keep me warm
I got to feel the fire
To keep me warm, I got to feel the fire
