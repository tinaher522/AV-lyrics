<song artist="Stevie_Wonder" title="At_Last">
Hey!
I ain't gotta worry no more, no
At last, my love has come along
My lonely days are over
And life is like a song
Oh baby, at last
The skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped up in clover
The night I looked at you
I found a dream that I could speak to
A dream that I could call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill that I have never known
Hey, you smiled
And then the spell was cast
And here we are in heaven
'Cause you're mine at last
Whoo baby, yeah, whoo
I found a dream that I could speak to
A dream I could call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheeks to
A thrill that I have never known
Hey, you smiled
And then the spell was cast
Here we are in heaven
And you're mine at last
Whoo
