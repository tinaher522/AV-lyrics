<song artist="Stevie_Wonder" title="Pastime_Paradise">
They've been spending most their lives living in a pastime paradise
They've been spending most their lives living in a pastime paradise
They've been wasting most their time glorifying days long gone behind
They've been wasting most their days in remembrance of ignorance's oldest praise
Tell me, who of them will come to be?
How many of them are you and me?
Dissipation
Race relations
Consolation
Segregation
Dispensation
Isolation
Exploitation
Mutilation
Mutations
Miscreation
Confirmation
To the evils of the world
They've been spending most their lives living in a future paradise
They've been spending most their lives living in a future paradise
They've been looking in their minds for the day that sorrow's lost from time
They keep telling of the day when the savior of love will come to stay
Tell me who of them will come to be?
How many of them are you and me?
Proclamation
Of race relations
Consolation
Integretion
Verification
Of Revelations
Acclamation
World salvation
Vibrations
Stimulation
Confirmation
To the peace of the world
They've been spending most their lives living in a pastime paradise
They've been spending most their lives living in a pastime paradise
They've been spending most their lives living in a future paradise
They've been spending most their lives living in a future paradise
We've been spending too much of our lives living in a pastime paradise
Let's start living our lives, living for the future paradise
Praise to our lives living for the future paradise
Shame to anyones life for living in the pastime paradise
