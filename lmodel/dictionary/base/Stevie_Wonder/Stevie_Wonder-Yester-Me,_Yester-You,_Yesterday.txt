<song artist="Stevie_Wonder" title="Yester-Me,_Yester-You,_Yesterday">
Yester-me yester-you yesterday
What happened to the world we knew
When we would dream and scheme
And while the time away
Yester-me yester-you yesterday
Where did it go that yester glow
When we could feel
The wheel of life turn our way
Yester-me yester-you yesterday
I had a dream so did you 
Life was warm and love was true
Two kids who followed all the rules
Yester-fools and now
Now it seems those yester-dreams
Were just a cruel
And foolish game we used to play
Yester-me yester-you yesterday
When I recall what we had
I feel lost I feel sad with nothing
But the memory of yester love 
And now it seems those yester dreams
Were just a cruel
And foolish game we had to play
Yester-me yester-you yesterday
Yester-me yester-you yesterday
Sing with me
Yester-me yester-you yesterday
One more time...
