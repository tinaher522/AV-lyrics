<song artist="Stevie_Wonder" title="Too_High">
Doo Doo Doo...
I'm too high
I'm too high
But I ain't touched the sky
I'm too high
I'm too high
But I ain't touched the sky
She's a girl in a dream
She sees a four eyed cartoon monster on the TV screen
She takes another puff and says it's a crazy scene
That red is green
She's a tangerine
I'm too high
I'm too high
But I ain't left the ground
I'm too high
I'm too high
I hope I never ever come down
She's the girl in her life
But her world's a superficial paradise
She had a chance to make it big more than once or twice
But no dice
She wasn't very nice
Doo Doo Doo...
I'm too high
I'm too high
I can't ever touch the sky
I'm too high
I'm so high
I feel like I'm about to die
She's a girl of the past
I guess that I got to her at last
Did you hear the news about the girl today?
She passed away
What did her friend say?
They said she's too high
Too high
Can't hang around anyway
Doo Doo Doo...
