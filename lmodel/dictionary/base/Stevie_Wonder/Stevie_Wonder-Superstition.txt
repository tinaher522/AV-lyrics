<song artist="Stevie_Wonder" title="Superstition">
Very superstitious, writing's on the wall
Very superstitious, ladder's 'bout to fall
Thirteen-month-old baby, broke the lookin' glass
Seven years of bad luck, your good thing's in your past
When you believe in things that you don't understand
Then you suffer
Superstition ain't the way
Yeah-eah, ay
Ooh, very superstitious, wash your face and hands
Rid me of the problem, do all that you can
Keep me in a daydream, keep me goin' strong, yeah
You don't wanna save me, sad is my song
When you believe in things that you don't understand
Then you suffer
Superstition ain't the way
Yeah, yeah
Oh, no
Ahh, ha!
Ow
Very superstitious, nothin' more to say
Very superstitious, the Devil's on his way
Thirteen-month-old baby, mmm, broke the lookin' glass
Seven years of bad luck, good things in your past
Mmm-hmm
When you believe in things that you don't understand
Then you suffer
Superstition ain't the way
No, no, no
Ooh
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah
Ooh
Ah
Mmm, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hee, hee, hee, hee, hee, hee
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-hoo
Hoo, hmm, hmm
