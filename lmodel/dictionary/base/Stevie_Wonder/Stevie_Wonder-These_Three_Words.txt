<song artist="Stevie_Wonder" title="These_Three_Words">
When was the last time that they heard you say 
Mother or father i love you
And when was the last time that they heard you say
Daughter or son i love you
Ones you say you cherish everyday 
Can instantly be taken away 
Then you say i know this cant be true
When you never took the time to simply tell them i love
When was the last time that they heard you say
Sister or brother i love you
And when was the last time that they heard you say
Darling or best friend i love you
The one for whom you'd give your very life
Could be taken in the twinkling of an eye
Through your tears you'd ask why did you go
Knowing you didn't always show just how much you love them so
These three words sweet and simple
These three words short and kind
These three words always kindles 
An aching heart to smile inside
I know a family who hasn't a cent to their name
And yet the joy and love they have between them 
They always claim
And when ones called from life the surived morn the loss
And will never be the same 
Yet the rejoice in knowing they gave them their all
These three words sweet and simple 
These three words short and kind 
These three words always kindles an aching heart
To smile inside
To smile inside
