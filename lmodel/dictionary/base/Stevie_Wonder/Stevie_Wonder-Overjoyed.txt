<song artist="Stevie_Wonder" title="Overjoyed">
Over time
I've been building my castle of love
Just for two
Though you never knew you were my reason
I've gone much too far
For you now to say
That I've got to throw
My castle away
Over dreams
I have picked out a perfect come true
Though you never knew it was of you I've been dreaming
The sandman has come
From too far away
For you to say 
Come back some other day
And though you don't believe that they do
They do come true
For did my dreams
Come true when I looked at you
And maybe too if you would believe
You too might be
Overjoyed
Over loved
Over me
Over hearts
I have painfully turned every stone
Just to find
I had found what I've 
Searched to discover
I've come much too far
For me now to find
The love that I sought
Can never be mine
And though you don't believe that they do
They do come true
For did my dreams
Come true when I looked at you
And maybe too if you would believe
You too might be
Overjoyed
Over loved
Over me
And though the odds say improbable
What do they know
For in romance
All true love needs is a chance
And maybe with a chance you will find
You too like I
Overjoyed
Over loved
Over you
Over you...
