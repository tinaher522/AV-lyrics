<song artist="Stevie_Wonder" title="Joy_(Takes_Over_Me)">
You can bet you're sweeter than ever
And your love is making it better
I can feel it in my bones
Ooh, each time we're alone
I live in ectasy
And my soul refuses sleep
'Cause joy, joy, joy takes over me
Through thick and thin I'll stand
Loving you always 
Yes I need you mama
To take the heartache away
I know the sun's gon' shine
And as long as you're mine
'Cause joy, joy, joy, joy I feel inside
Oh yeah, oh
Your love's potion
Gives me the notion
To shout out loud, ooh baby, baby, baby, babe
Like a spinning top
I can't stop
Ooh, loving you 
You know Stevie loves you
Needs you baby, oh ah
You know my love is meant to live
Aint goin' nowhere
And I do believe girl
You were meant for me
'Cause I live in ectasy
And my soul refuses sleep
'Cause joy takes over me
Oh baby joy
Joy, joy, joy, joy 
joy joy joy joy joy joy
The way you love me, joy
Takes over me
Oh the way you love me
The way you need me
Baby please don't leave me
I get joy, ah, wooh
Joy, ah, joy, ah
