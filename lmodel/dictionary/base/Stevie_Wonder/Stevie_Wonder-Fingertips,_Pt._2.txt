<song artist="Stevie_Wonder" title="Fingertips,_Pt._2">
Everybody say yeah (yeah!)
Say yeah (yeah!)
Say yeah (yeah!)
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Just a little bit of sou-ou-ou-ou-oul
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Clap your hands just a little bit louder
Clap your hands just a little bit louder
I know yeah
Everybody had a good time
So if you want me to
If you want me to
I'm gonna swing the song, yeah
Just one more time when I come by
Just one more time when I come by
So be advised (?)
Come on
Goodbye goodbye
Goodbye goodbye
Goodbye goodbye goodbye
I'm gonna go, yeah
I'm gonna go, yeah
