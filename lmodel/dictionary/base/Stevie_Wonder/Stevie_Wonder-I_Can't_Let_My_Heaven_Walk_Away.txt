I can't let my Heaven walk away
Just can't let my Heaven walk away
Gotta find a way to make her stay
I don't know what I've done wrong
Look up and find my Heaven gone
Called her name but I called in vain
I know she can't answer from a picture frame
Only an hour ago I held in real flesh and blood
She just grabbed her coat and said, "Please, I've had enough."
She kept me well like a Sunday prayer
Just like my own right hand the girl was always there
To every man but me, her eyes were blind
I was in the promise land long before my time
I can't let my Heaven walk away
Just can't let my Heaven walk away
Just gotta find a way to make her stay
I don't know what I've done wrong
Look up and find my Heaven gone
I accused my baby of being a liar
I said the flesh is weak in God's key trial
I only asked her to hear her tell me no
But my question back-fired, I didn't expect her to go
I can't let my Heaven walk away
Just can't let my Heaven walk away
Just gotta find a way to make her stay
I can't let her go
I can't let my Heaven walk away
Just can't let my Heaven walk away
Just gotta find a way to make her stay
(I can't let my Heaven walk away)
(I can't let my Heaven walk away)
Just gotta find a way to make her stay
