<song artist="Blink-182" title="Jimmy_Neutron_Theme">
Into the stars
To buy candy bars 
Rides a kid with 
A knack for inventions
A super powered-mind
A mechanical K-9
He rescues the day 
From your destruction
He's gotta save the world
And get to school on time
So many things to do
And not much time
Oh so off the ground 
Up in the air 
Out into the atmosphere
Who can we count on?
Jimmy Neutron
Who can we count on?
Jimmy Neutron
Who can we count on? 
Jimmy Neutron
