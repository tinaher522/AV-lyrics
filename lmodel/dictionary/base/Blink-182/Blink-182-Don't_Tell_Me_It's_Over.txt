<song artist="Blink-182" title="Don't_Tell_Me_It's_Over">
I hear the phone, it rings so violently 
Can't leave my room, can't breathe since she left me 
I will admit, I hate those things I said 
Girls always cry, guys will never admit they did 
Hold on, hold on 
Hold on, hold on 
Don't tell me that it's over 
I'm not used to this temptation 
And when you come back running 
there's no use for explanation 
I think things aren't too hopeful
even with my expert knowledge 
Most girls do mean trouble 
because they are rarely honest 
What's with the jokes, all the routines they play 
Screw with my head, now I cave in 'til get their way 
Guys like to run, chicks love to yell, you see 
Guys hate to fight, girls think it's therapy 
Hold on, hold on 
Hold on, hold on 
Don't tell me that it's over 
I'm not used to this temptation 
And when you come back running 
there's no use for explanation 
I think things aren't too hopeful
even with my expert knowledge 
Most girls do mean trouble 
because they are rarely honest 
Hold on, hold on 
Hold on, hold on 
Don't tell me that it's over 
I'm not used to this temptation 
And when you come back running 
there's no use for explanation 
I think things aren't too hopeful
even with my expert knowledge 
Most girls do mean trouble 
because they are rarely honest 
Don't tell me that it's over 
I'm not used to this temptation 
And when you come back running 
there's no use for explanation 
I think things aren't too hopeful
even with my expert knowledge 
Most girls do mean trouble 
because they are rarely honest 
Don't tell me that it's over 
I'm not used to this temptation
