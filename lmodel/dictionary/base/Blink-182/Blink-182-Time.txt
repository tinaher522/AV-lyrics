<song artist="Blink-182" title="Time">
When the clock strikes two 
There's just so much to do 
And I can't explain what I need
Jobs and social groups 
Hearing the latest news 
Keeping your reputation clean
And I don't want to worry 
About being on time 
I see the way you hurry 
And time runs your life 
Again
The difference between East and West 
Money means so much less 
And objects aren't so important to buy
I wish that a clock 
Could often just be stopped 
And then we look into the time
And I don't want to worry 
About being on time 
I see the way you hurry 
And time runs your life 
Again
