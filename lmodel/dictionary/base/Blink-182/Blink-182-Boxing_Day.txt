<song artist="Blink-182" title="Boxing_Day">
Let’s get started the faint and broken hearted
Hold up I got something I cannot hide
Worse pain killer that all in filler
The part and departed look in my eyes
It’s sad how far you ran
I’ll search this land up through the clouds 
Then back here
We could reignite, like fireflies
Like an atom bomb at all hours
I’m empty like the day after Christmas
Swept beneath the wave of your goodbye
You left me on the day after Christmas
There’s nothing left to say, and so
Goodnight
I will follow the trail to tomorrow 
With my loneliness with sorrow
All through the night
Sons and daughters 
Mothers and their fathers
Cross the bridges and the waters
For bruise left behind
It’s sad how far you ran
I’ll search this land up through the clouds 
Then back here
We could reignite, like fireflies
Like an atom bomb at all hours
I’m empty like the day after Christmas
Swept beneath the wave of your goodbye
You left me on the day after Christmas
There’s nothing left to say, and so
Goodnight
I’m empty like the day after Christmas
Swept beneath the wave of your goodbye
You left me on the day after Christmas
There’s nothing left to say, and so
Goodnight
There’s nothing left to say, and so
Goodnight
Goodnight
