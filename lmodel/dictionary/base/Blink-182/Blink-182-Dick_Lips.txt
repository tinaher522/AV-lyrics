Please, Mom 
You ground me all the time 
I know that I was right 
All along
And I'm hoping 
Remember I'm a kid 
I know not what I did 
Just having fun
You couldn't (I couldn't wait) wait for something new (for something new)
And yesterday (and yesterday) I thought of you (I thought of you)
It left me to think as if I couldn't walk away 
It's too late, I fell through
Nothing to lose 
A boy who went out when he finished all his chores 
Nothing to do 
They can't trust me because I blew it once before
Shit, Dad 
Please don't kick my ass 
I know I've seen you trashed 
At least one time
Can I blame it 
On one of my dumb friends?
It's been awhile 
Since I have used that line
You couldn't wait (you couldn't wait) couldn't wait for something new (for something new)
And yesterday (and yesterday) I thought of you (I thought of you
It left me to think as if I couldn't walk away 
It's too late, I fell through
Nothing to lose 
A boy who went out when he finished all his chores 
Nothing to do 
They can't trust me because I blew it once before
(Alright)
Nothing to lose 
A boy who went out when he finished all his chores 
Nothing to do 
They can't trust me because I blew it once before
