<song artist="Blink-182" title="Man_Over_Board">
So sorry, it's over, so sorry, it's over
There's so much more that I wanted and
There's so much more that I needed and
Time keeps moving on and on and on
Soon well all be gone
Let's take some time to talk this over
You're out of line and rarely sober
We can't depend on your excuses
'Cause in the end it's fucking useless
You can only lean on me for so long
Bring the ship about to watch a friend drown
Sit out on the ledge, begged you to come down
You can only lean on me for so long
I remember shots without a chaser
Absent minded thoughts, now you're a stranger
Cover up the scars, put on your game-face
Left you in the bar to try and save face
You can only lean on me for so long
Bring the ship about to watch a friend drown
Sit out on the ledge, begged you to come down
You can only lean on me for so long
So sorry it's over, so sorry it's over
There's so much more that I wanted and
There's so much more that I needed and
Time keeps moving on and on and on
Soon well all be gone
Man on a mission, can't say I miss him around
Insider information, hand in your resignation
Loss of a good friend, best of intentions I found
Tight lipped procrastination, yeah later, see you around
