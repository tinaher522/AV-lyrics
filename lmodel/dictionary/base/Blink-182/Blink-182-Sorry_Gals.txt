<song artist="Blink-182" title="Sorry_Gals">
We've been thinking about what we've done
we know now that for you that this wasn't fun
We know that we are stupid all the time
We can't beleive that you hardly mind
we'll you shake this off pretend it's all okay
you know we think about you everyday
We do
Do you care if we don't know what to say
will you sleep tonite or will you think of us
We will
please forgive us now for the things we said
without you we think we would be dead
think about this so slow
do you love us so
Do you?
Do you care if we don't know what to say
will you sleep tonite or will you think of us
We will
