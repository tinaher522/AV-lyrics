<song artist="Blink-182" title="My_Pet_Sally">
Im gonna wanna see myself with something too
friends I don't pay are friends I never knew
so I took a chance and got some help from 
few ang got a long and skinny friend to talk to
cuz I had the time and the liberty to play with my new pet Sally please don't go away Sally please
nomore lonely showers and uneaten foods my 
salamander has hygine too and if he thinks of
me the way I think of you the only next step for
him is to say I do
cuz I had the time and the liberty to play with my new pet Sally
P.O I love you
Sally please don't go away Sally please
Sally please don't go away, I won't be living in
yesterday the lonely nights, getting beat beat up
by gays in bar fights
