This makes no sense.
This makes no sense.
This makes no sense.
This makes no...
No...
No...
No...
No...

This air is too thick to breathe, 
so just drive.
These eyes are too sick to see; 
don't leave me behind.
There's something swimming in my blood, 
something's rotting in my brain.
Limbs smothered from the flood, 
I can't recognize your face.
I need to leave, 
so just drive.
Burning lights on the street, 
fight--fighting the gravity.
When I'm beat and defeated, 
they'll take you away from me.
Dead and lost in a dream, 
this--this is the last of me.
I'm always fighting the gravity.
Tonight is too much for me to get through.
Tomorrow's just a darkened hall to an empty room,
when I'm far away from you.
Burning lights on the street, 
fight--fighting the gravity.
When I'm beat and defeated, 
they'll take you away from me.
Dead and lost in a dream, 
this--this is the last of me.
I'm always fighting the gravity.
I'm always fighting the gravity.
This makes no sense.
This makes no sense.
This makes no sense.
This makes no...
No...
No...
No...
No...
