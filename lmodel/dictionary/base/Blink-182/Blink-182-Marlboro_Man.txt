<song artist="Blink-182" title="Marlboro_Man">
I whistle good
I'm kinda straight
And I can can can have fun
No matter what I do
I've always assumed that
I can't go on sucking on my thumb
Sifting through my toys
Resting at my door
After thinking that I couldn't read
Sitting on the porch
And waiting for porno
While sucking on my damn fugi
I don't know why
I just want to die
And here's 2 bucks for you
This is the part where I should really part
But I guess I've got nothing to do
I don't know why
I just want to die
And here's 2 bucks for you
This is the part where I should really part
But I guess I've got nothing to do
What'd our grandma think of me
All that I've got to do
Guess I should its a wonder
My breath
its how the streets cave in everyday
Oh how the antelopes
Tom's thumb just walked right through my nose
What'd our grandma think of me
All that I've got to do
Guess I should its a wonder
