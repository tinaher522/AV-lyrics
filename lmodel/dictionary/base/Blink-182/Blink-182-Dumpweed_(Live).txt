Tom:
It's understood, I said it many ways
Too scared to run, I'm too scared to stay
I said I'd leave, but I could never leave her
If I did, you know I'd never cheat her
But this I ask, It's what I want to know
How would you feel, If I should choose to go
Another guy, you think it'd be unlikely
Another guy, you think he'd want to fight me
She's a dove, she's a fuckin' nightmare
Unpredictable, it's my mistake to stay here
On the go and it's way too late to play
I need a girl that I can train
I heard it once, I'm sure I heard it twice
My dad used to give me all of his advice
He would say you got to turn your back and run now
Come on son, you haven't got a chance now
She's a dove, She's a fuckin' nightmare
Unpredictable, it was my mistake to stay here
On the go and it's way too late to play
I need a girl that I can train
She's a dove, She's a fuckin' nightmare
Unpredictable, it was my mistake to stay here
On the go and it's way too late to play
I need a girl that I can train
Need a girl that I can train
Need a girl that I can train
Turn your back and run now
You haven't got a chance now
Tom: Oh, wow. I'm fuckin' in the mood - to party.
Mark: Hey, alright!
Tom: We're fuckin' alright. Hey, you know what we're gonna do tonight? A whole lotta fuckin'.
Mark: We're all gonna get laid!
Mark: This song's about my herpes, it's called "Don't Leave Me". It goes like this.
