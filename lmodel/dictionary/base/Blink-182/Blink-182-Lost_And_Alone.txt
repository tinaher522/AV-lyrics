<song artist="Blink-182" title="Lost_And_Alone">
I'm sick, of always hearing, 
All the sad songs, on the radio,
All day , it is there to remind,
An over sensative guy,
That he's lost and alone yeah!
I hate our favourite restuarant
Our favourite movie,
Our favourite show,
We would stay up,
All through the night,
We laugh and get high,
And never answer the phone.
I can't forgive,
Can't forget
Can't give in
What went wrong cause,
You said this was right,
You fucked up my life
I'm sick, of always hearing,
Sappy love songs, on the radio,
This place, it's fucking cursed in it's plane
And i could never escape,
When my heart, it explodes,
I can't forgive,
Can't forget
Can't give in
What went wrong cause,
You said this was right,
You fucked up my life
I'm kicking, out fearsly
At the world around me!
What went wrong?
I'm kicking, out fearsly
At the world around me!
What went wrong?
I'm kicking, out fearsly
At the world around me!
What went wrong?
I'm kicking, out fearsly
At the world around me!
What went wrong?
I'm kicking, out fearsly
At the world around me!
What went wrong?
I'm kicking!
