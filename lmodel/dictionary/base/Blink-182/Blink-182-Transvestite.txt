<song artist="Blink-182" title="Transvestite">
My mom, she's not a woman anymore, 
She dresses like, dresses like, dresses like a man (dresses like a man), 
Oh how she's not as feminine as she 
Used to be before. 
Now she is so damned masculine.
I close my eyes (I close my eyes) 
My mom's not a woman anymore 
She's wearing a disguise 
Everytime she leaves through that door
My mom's not the same 
As she was in the past 
If I misbehave she kicks my ass
My mom's not quite the 
Woman that she was before 
When my friends come over 
She likes to wrestle them down to the floor
I close my eyes (I close my eyes) 
My mom's not a woman anymore 
She's wearing a disguise 
Everytime she leaves through that door
My mom's a, my mom's a, my mom's a transvestite
