Mark:
Don't leave me all alone
Just drop me off at home
I'll be fine, it's not the first
Just like last night, but a little worse and
She said that I'm not the one that she thinks about and
She said it stopped being fun, I just bring her down
I said don't let your future be destroyed by my past
She said "Don't let my door hit your ass", fuck yeah
Just give me one more chance, I'll try this time
I'll give you yours, I won't take mine
I'll listen up, pretend to care
Go on ahead, I'll meet you there and
She said that I'm not the one that she thinks about and
She said it stopped being fun, I just bring her down
I said don't let your future be destroyed by my past
She said "Don't let my door hit your ass", bass solo
[Bass solo]
Let's try this one more time with feeling
One more time with feeling
One more time with feeling
One more time with feeling
She said that I'm not the one that she thinks about and
She said it stopped being fun, I just bring her down
I said don't let your future be destroyed by my past
She said "Don't let my door hit your ass"
Don't leave me all alone
Just drop me off at home, and I'll be fine (Tom: You will be fine you fucking asshole. Wow!)

Tom: Excuse me.
Mark: Thank you.
Tom: Hey, uh - hey Mark. We have a very special person here that wants to say "hi." You guys, this is Satan.
Tom (as Satan): Hello kids. If you guys will take off your pants then maybe I'll be a little more happy. I want to have fun with you but I'm going to have to see your dick - twirl. I have to go away now because there is another song - and I've got a boner. Do you guys mind if I get a boner, kids?
