<song artist="Blink-182" title="Weak_And_Powerless">
Tilling my own grave to keep me level
Jam another dragon down the hole.
Driven to the rhythm and the echo of a solitary siren
One that pushes me along and leaves me
So desperate and ravenous
I'm so week and powerless
Over you.
Some one feed the monkey
While I dig in search of china.
White as Dracula as I approach the bottom.
So desperate and ravenous
I'm so weak and powerless
Over you.
Little angel, go away
Come again some other day
Devil has my ear today
I'll never hear a word you say.
Promised I would find a little
Solace and some peace of mind
Whatever just as long as I don't feel
So desperate and ravenous
I'm so weak and powerless
Desperate and ravenous
I'm so weak and powerless
Over
Over you.
