<song artist="Blink-182" title="Dammit_-_Live">
This one goes out, to all our fans
To all the punk-rock kids, who've been into our band
You only know us, from this one song
Here's news for you, we've been around for six years long and it hurts
(Fuck, yeah)
It's alright to tell me what you think about me
I won't try to argue or hold it against you
I know that you're leaving, you must have your reasons
The season is calling your pictures are falling down
The steps that I retrace, the sad look on your face
The timing and structure, did you hear he fucked her?
A day late, a buck short I'm writing the report
On losing and failing when I move I'm flailing now
It'll happen once again I'll turn to a friend
Someone that understands sees through the master plan
But everybody's gone and I've been here for too long
To face this on my own, well, I guess this is growing up
Well, I guess this is growing up
And maybe I'll see you at a movie sneak preview
You'll show up and walk by on the arm of that guy
And I'll smile and you'll wave, we'll pretend it's okay
The charade it won't last when he's gone, I won't come back
It'll happen once again you'll turn to a friend
Someone that understands sees through the master plan
But everybody's gone and you've been here for too long
To face this on your own, well, I guess this is growing up
I wish I was little bit taller
I wish I was a baller
I wish I had a girl that looked good, I would call her
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat and a six four Impala
I wish I was little bit taller
I wish I was a baller
I wish I had a girl that looked good, I would call her
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat and a six four Impala
Well, I guess this is growing up
Well, I guess this is growing up
Well, I guess this is growing up
Well, I guess this is growing up
Well, I guess this is growing up
{We'd like to thank you all for coming out}
