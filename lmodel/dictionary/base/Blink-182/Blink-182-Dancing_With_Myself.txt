<song artist="Blink-182" title="Dancing_With_Myself">
In the walls of Tokyo 
Down in London town's a go-go 
With the record selection 
And the mirror's reflection 
I'm be dancing with myself
Oh, when there's no one else in sight 
In the crowded, lonely night 
I waited so long for my love vibration 
And I'm dancing with myself
{Refrain} 
Oh, oh, oh dancing with myself 
Oh, oh, oh dancing with myself 
When there's nothing to lose 
And there's nothing to prove 
I'll dancing with myself 
Oh, oh, oh, oh
If I looked all over the world 
And there's every type of girl 
But their empty eyes seem to pass me by 
And leave me dancing with myself
So let's sink another drink 
'Cause it'll give me time to think 
If I had a chance, I'd ask the world to dance 
And I'm dancing with myself
{Refrain} 
Oh, oh, oh, oh (4x)
Well, if I looked all over the world 
And there's every type of girl 
But their empty eyes seem to pass me by 
And leave me dancing with myself
So let's sink another drink 
'Cause it'll give me time to think 
If I had a chance, I'd ask world to dance 
And I'll be dancing with myself
{As refrain} 
Oh, oh, oh dancing with myself 
Oh, oh, oh dancing with myself 
If I had a chance, I'd ask world to dance 
If I had a chance, I'd ask world to dance 
If I had a chance, I'd ask world to dance
Oh, oh, oh, oh (9x) 
(on the fifth time round mark sings the below over oh, oh, oh, oh)
Yea sweat
An I sweat
An I sweat
An I sweat
An I sweat sweat sweat sweat sweat sweat sweat sweat sweat sweat sweat
