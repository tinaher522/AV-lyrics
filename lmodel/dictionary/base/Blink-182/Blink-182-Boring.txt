<song artist="Blink-182" title="Boring">
You don't need nothin' 
And I know that you won't even try 
Don't wait for me to help you 
Too late for any of my advice
No trust 
All I got is lies 
Boring 
Alright
Misplaced your values 
Forgot being the importance of being right 
Don't sit there and act humble 
I've heard your story a thousand times
No trust 
All I got is lies 
Boring 
Alright
