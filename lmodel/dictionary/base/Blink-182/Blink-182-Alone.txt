<song artist="Blink-182" title="Alone">
What were doing here, now no one knows
The thoughts, the thing that's I don't know
Maybe this is all a nightmare
Your laughter ends in darkness
you can do what you want to
I need some time alone
between what answers
I need some time alone
You don't talk to me
You don't notice me
You don't talk to me
You don't notice me
Maybe this is just a nightmare
Your laugher end in darkness.
not in the mood, not just to justify
not in the mood to think of what a lie
you can do what you want to
I need some time alone
between what answers
I need some time alone
You don't talk to me
You don't notice me
You don't talk to me
You don't notice me
