<song artist="Blink-182" title="Peggy_Sue">
I know what it's like to be alone sitting in your room 
Listening to all those doubts that your parents have to say to you
And then your head gets all cluttered inside 
Trying to stay awake 
Everything they say are lies 
That's all the shit that you ever have to take
So hold in all your aggresion 
Because your grinding your teeth on down to 
The bottom of your chin
It's not easy or so damn pleasing 
To not laugh at everything they say as 
They tell you what to be you're not alone
I know what it's like to be denied at everything you do 
It's not the same reason why 
That makes you change the things that you once knew
As your head gets all cluttered inside 
You give more than you take 
Everything they say are lies 
That's all the shit that you ever have to take
So hold in all your aggresion 
Because your grinding your teeth on down to 
The bottom of your chin
It's not easy or so damn pleasing 
To not laugh at everything they say as 
They tell you what to be you're not alone
You say you want to take off your shoes as you 
Walk barefoot down the street 
Just to be the things that you can't be 
Just live for one more week (Go!)
You say you want to take off your shoes as you 
Walk barefoot down the street 
Just to be the things that you can't be 
Just live for one more week
So hold in all your aggresion 
Because your grinding your teeth on down to 
The bottom of your chin
It's not easy or so damn pleasing 
To not laugh at every word they say that 
They tell you what to be you're not alone
