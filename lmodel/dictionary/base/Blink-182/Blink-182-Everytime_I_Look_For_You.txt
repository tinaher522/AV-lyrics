<song artist="Blink-182" title="Everytime_I_Look_For_You">
Never found out why you left him
But this answer begs that question.
Too blind to see tomorrow,
Too broke to beg or borrow
Young and stupid
(Left wide open)
Hearts are wasted
(Lives are broken)
One more point of contention,
I need some intervention
Approached with vague intentions
Betray my short attention-
Span the distance
(Bridge the border)
Beg forgiveness
('Round the corner)
Every time I look for you, the sun goes down
And I stumble when this whole thing runs aground
I left another message; you are never around
But every time I look for you, the sun goes down once more
Will the last one out please shut the door?
More time apart will give you
A few more months to argue.
Is this too much to live through?
It always seemed too far to
Drive the point home
(Send more letters)
Pray tomorrow
(Ends up better)
Every time I look for you, the sun goes down
And I stumble when this whole thing runs aground
I left another message; you are never around
But every time I look for you, the sun goes down once more
Will the last one out please shut the door?
I never did do anything that she asked
I never let what happened stay in the past
I never did quite understand what she meant,
In spite of everything, in spite of everything
Every time I look for you, the sun goes down
And I stumble when this whole thing runs aground
I left another message; you are never around
But every time I look for you, the sun goes down
And I stumble when this whole thing runs aground
I left another message; you are never around
But every time I look for you, the sun goes down.
