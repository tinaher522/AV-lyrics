<song artist="Blink-182" title="Bastards">
One time I met this girl,
I talked to her online one night,
I asked her if she was alright,
Didn't say who I was,
Now i'm f**ked over because,
You bastards,
Telling her who I am,
You bastards,
You could all go to F**king Iran,
I can't deal with her anymore,
She's acting like a whore
Say it ain't so,
She's a real hoe,
She called me last night,
About a quarter to 8,
I said, "why you calling so late?"
She said, "I heard what you said"
"I hope you end up dead"
And all I wanted was some head!
You bastards,
Telling her who I am,
You bastards,
You could all go to F**king Iran,
I can't deal with this yet,
This girl's making me wanna forget.
Even though she's really hot,
Mentally stable is what she's not,
She's got something wrong in her head,
Telling me I should end up dead
You bastards,
Telling her who I am,
You bastards,
You could all go to F**king Iran,
I can't deal with this ever,
Leave me alone forever.
