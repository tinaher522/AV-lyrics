<song artist="Blink-182" title="Aliens_Exsist">
Hey mom there's something in the backroom
I hope it's not the creatures from above
You used to read me stories as if my dreams were boring
We all know conspiracies are dumb
What if people knew that these were real
I'd leave my closet door open all night
I know the CIA would say, what you hear is all hearsay
I wish someone would tell me what was right
Up all night long
And there's something very wrong
And I know it must be late
Been gone since yesterday
I'm not like you guys
I'm not like you
I am still the skeptic, yes, you know me
Been best friends and will be till we die
I got an injection of fear from the abduction
My best friend thinks I'm just telling lies, alright
Up all night long
And there's something very wrong
And I know it must be late
Been gone since yesterday
I'm not like you guys
I'm not like you
Dark and scary, ordinary
Explanation, information
Nice to know ya, paranoia
Where's my mother, biofather
Up all night long
And there's something very wrong
And I know it must be late
Been gone since yesterday
I'm not like you guys
Twelve majestic lies
