<song artist="Blink-182" title="I_Won't_Be_Home_For_Xmas">
Deck the halls with boughs of holly fa-la-la-la
T'is the season to be jolly fa-la-la-la
Outside the carolers start to sing
I can't explain the joy they bring
'Cos joy is something they don't bring me
My girlfriend is by my side
From our roof is hanging sickles of ice
Their whiney voices get irritating
It's Christmas time again
So I stand with a dead smile on my face
Wondering how much of my time they'll waste
Oh God, I hate these Satan's helpers
And then I guess I must have snapped
'Cos I grabbed a baseball bat
And made them all run for shelter
It's Christmas time again
It's time to be nice to the people
I can't stand all year
I'm growing tired of all this Christmas cheer
You people scare me, please stay away from my home
If you don't wanna get me down
Just leave the presents and let me be alone
Well, I guess it's not cool to freak on Christmas Eve
'Cos the cops came and arrested me
They had an unfair advantage
And even though the jail didn't have a tree
Christmas came a night early
'Cos a guy named Bubber unwrapped my package
It's Christmas time again
It's time to be nice to the people
I can't stand all year
I'm growing tired of all this Christmas cheer
You people scare me, please stay away from my home
If you don't wanna get me down
Just leave the presents and let me be alone
I won't be home, I won't be home for Christmas
I won't be home, I won't be home for Christmas day
I won't be home, I won't be home for Christmas
I won't be home, I won't be home for Christmas day
I won't be home, I won't be home for Christmas
I won't be home, I won't be home for Christmas day
