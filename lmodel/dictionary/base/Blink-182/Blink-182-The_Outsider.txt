<song artist="Blink-182" title="The_Outsider">
Help me if you can
It's just that this is going away
I want it so quickly please,
Help me understand what
I've given in to all the years
And this darkness I have known
Lying to myself again
Suicidal imbecile
Think about it, put it on the faultline
What'll it take to get it through to you precious
Come on to this, why do you wanna throw it away like this
Such a bitch, why do I wanna watch you
Disconnect and self destruct one woman at a time
What's your rush now, everyone will have his day to die
Medicated, drawn away, picture perfect, no more legiments
Narcisistic, drawn away, craving fame and all this decadance
Lying through your teeth again
Suicidal imbecile

Think about it, put it on the fautline
What'll it take to get it through to you precious
Come to this, why do you wanna throw it away like this
Such a bitch, why do I wanna watch you
Disconnect and self destruct one woman at a time
What's your rush now, everyone will have his day to die
They were right about you
They were right about you
Lying to my face again
Suicidal imbecile
Think about it put it on the fautline
What'll it take to get it through to you precious
Come on to this , why do you wanna throw it away like this
Such a bitch, come to this, come to this
Disconnect and self destruct, one woman at a time
What's your hurry, everyone will have his day to die
If you choose to pull the trigger, should your karma prove sincere,
Do it somewhere far away from here
