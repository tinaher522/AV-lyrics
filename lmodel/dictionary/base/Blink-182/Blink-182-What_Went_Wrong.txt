<song artist="Blink-182" title="What_Went_Wrong">
I'm sick of always hearing 
All the sad songs on the radio 
All day it is there to remind 
An over-sensitive guy that he's lost and alone, yeah 
I hate our favorite restaurant, our favorite movie, our favorite show,
We would stay up all through the night 
We would laugh and get high, and never answer the phone 
I can't forgive, can't forget 
Can't give in, what went wrong 
Cause you said this was right 
You fucked up my life 
I'm sick of always hearing 
Sappy love songs on the radio 
This place, it's fucking cursed and it's plagued 
And I can never escape when my heart it explodes 
I can't forgive, can't forget 
Can't give in, what went wrong 
Cause you said this was right 
You fucked up my life 
I'm kicking out fiercely at the world around me 
What went wrong 
I'm kicking out fiercely at the world around me 
What went wrong 
I'm kicking out fiercely at the world around me 
What went wrong 
I'm kicking out fiercely at the world around me 
What went wrong 
I'm kicking
