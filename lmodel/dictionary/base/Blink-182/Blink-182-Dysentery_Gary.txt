<song artist="Blink-182" title="Dysentery_Gary">
Got a lotta heart ache 
He's a fuckin' weasel 
His issues make my mind ache 
Want to make a deal
Cause I love your little motions 
You do with your pigtails 
What a nice creation 
Worth another night in jail
He's a player, diarrhea giver, tried to grow his hair out 
When friends were listening to Slayer 
I would like to find him Friday night 
Hanging out with mom and trying on his father's tights 
Life just sucks 
I lost the one 
I'm giving up
She found someone 
There's plenty more
Girls are such a drag
So all you little ladies 
Be sure to choose the right guys 
You'll come back to me maybe 
I'll shower you with lies
Got a lotta heart ache 
He's a fuckin' weasel 
Decisions make my mind ache 
Want to make a deal
Ease away the problems and the pain 
The girl chose the guy who makes you want to kick and scream 
All along, you wish that she would stay 
Fuck the guy who took and ran away
He's a player, diarrhea giver, tried to grow his hair out 
When friends were listening to Slayer 
I would like to find him Friday night 
Hanging out with mom and trying on his father's tights
Life just sucks
I lost the one
I'm giving up
She found someone
There's plenty more
Girls are such a drag
Fuck this place! 
I lost the war
I hate you all
Your mom's a whore
Wheres my dog? 
Cause girls are such a drag
