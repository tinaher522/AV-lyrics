<song artist="Blink-182" title="Love_Is_Dangerous">
I've had it, 
with this damn double vision.
My hand's swollen, 
I can't keep holding on.
My hearts sinking, 
and stuck in deadly rhythm.
I can't fake it. 
I can't, 
can't brush it off.
Love, 
Love is dangerous.
Love, 
Love is so dangerous.
I'm back at it, 
I just don't seem to listen.
I see your lips, 
I just can't hear the sound.
It's all static, 
just like my television.
Her skills sharp, 
and her eyes cut through the clouds.
(I need..)
Love, 
love is dangerous.
(Guys, don't be fooled when she says it's...)
Love, 
love is so dangerous.
(We betray the ones we care about.)
Love, 
Love is so dangerous (the ones we care about)
(Life's cruel so we all pretend to find...)
Love, 
love is dangerous.
(I need..)
Love, 
love is dangerous.
(Guys, don't be fooled when she says it's...)
Love, 
love is so dangerous.
(We betray the ones we care about.)
Love, 
Love is so dangerous (the ones we care about)
(Life's cruel so we all pretend to find...)
Love, 
love is dangerous.
