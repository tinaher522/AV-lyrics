<song artist="Blink-182" title="Wishing_Well">
Been gone a long time
I kinda lost my way, I can't find it
And I caught a short ride
To the grave and back this season
I can try to get by
But every time I start to panic
I'm a little bit shy
A bit strange and a little bit manic.
I went to a wishing well, it sank to the ocean floor
Cut up by sharpened rocks, and washed up along the shore
I reached for a shooting star, it burned a hole through my hand
Made its way through my heart, had fun in the promised land.
On the narrowing line, what a way to sort my troubles
In a very short time, gonna pop, better duck and cover
Can you figure me out? I got caught like a little kid stealing
Did I say it too loud? A bit hard or a little misleading.
I went to a wishing well, it sank to the ocean floor
Cut up by sharpened rocks and washed up along the shore
I reached for a shooting star, it burned a hole through my hand
Made its way through my heart, had fun in the promised land.
I went to a wishing well, it sank to the ocean floor
Cut up by sharpened rocks and washed up along the shore
I reached for a shooting star, it burned a hole through my hand
Made its way through my heart, had fun in the promised land.
I went to a wishing well, it sank to the ocean floor
Cut up by sharpened rocks and washed up along the shore
I reached for a shooting star, it burned a hole through my hand
Made its way through my heart, had fun in the promised land.
