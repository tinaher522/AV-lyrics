<song artist="Blink-182" title="M+M's">
You and I should get away for a while
I just wanna be alone with you smile
Buy some candy and cigarettes and we'll get in my car
We'll blast the stereo and we'll drive to Madagascar
Because when I'm with you there's nothing I wouldn't do
I just wanna be your only one
I'm grasping out at straws thinking back to what I saw
That night on the floor when we were all alone
My love life was getting so bland
There are only so many ways I can make love with my hand
Sometimes it makes me want to laugh
Sometimes I want to take my toaster in the bath
Because when I'm with you there's nothing I wouldn't do
I just want to be your only one
I'm grasping out at straws thinking back to what I saw
That night on the floor when we were all alone
Who's gonna be the odd man out?
I don't wanna be the odd man out
Is this going to be the end
Or are you going to be my new girlfriend?
