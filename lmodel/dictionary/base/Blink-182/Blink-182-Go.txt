<song artist="Blink-182" title="Go">
Are we all victims of opportunity
Locked outside the door back in '83
I heard the angry voice of the man
Inside and saw the look of fear
In my mother's eyes
Go go go go
Go go go go
I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know
Mom get in the car and let's drive away
She said " I 'm sorry mark but
There's nowhere to stay"
Gave up all her hope and went back inside
Hid her broken heart and let the engine die
Go go go go
Go go go go
I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know
Why do evil men get away with it?
Can't you see that  I 'm in a world of shit?
Turn your back on hope and go back inside
Stop my bleeding heart and let the engine die
I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know
(go go) I  don't wanna know
(go go) I  don't wanna know
(go go) I  don't wanna know
(go go) I  don't wanna know
