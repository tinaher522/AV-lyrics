<song artist="Blink-182" title="Stay_Together_For_The_Kids">
It's hard to wake up
When the shades have been pulled shut
This house is haunted
It's so pathetic
It makes no sense at all
I'm ripe with things to say
The words rot and fall away
If a stupid poem
Could fix this home
I'd read it every day
So here's your holiday
Hope you enjoy it this time
You gave it all away
It was mine
So when you're dead and gone
Will you remember this night?
Twenty years now lost
It's not right
Their anger hurts my ears
Been running strong for seven years
Rather than fix the problems
They never solve them
It makes no sense at all
I see them every day
We get along, so why can't they?
If this is what he wants
And it's what she wants
Then why's there so much pain?
So here's your holiday
Hope you enjoy it this time
You gave it all away
It was mine
So when you're dead and gone
Will you remember this night?
Twenty years now lost
It's not right
So here's your holiday
Hope you enjoy it this time
You gave it all away
It was mine
So when you're dead and gone
Will you remember this night?
Twenty years now lost
It's not right
It's not right
It's not right
It's not right
