<song artist="Blink-182" title="Girl_At_The_Rock_Show">
Hanging out behind the club on the weekends
Acting stupid, getting drunk with my best friends
I couldn't wait for the summer and the Warped Tour
I remember that it's the first time that I saw her there
She's getting kicked out of school 'cause she's failing
I'm kinda nervous 'cause I think all her friends hate me
She's the one, she'll always be there
She took my hand and I made it I swear
Because I fell in love with the girl at the rock show
She said what? And I told her that I didn't know
She's so cool, better sneak in through her window
Everything's better when she's around
Can't wait until her parents go out of town
I fell in love with the girl at the rock show
When we said, we were gonna move to Vegas
I remember the look her mother gave us
Seventeen, without a purpose or direction
We don't owe anyone a fucking explanation
Because I fell in love with the girl at the rock show
She said what? And I told her that I didn't know
She's so cool, better sneak in through her window
Everything's better when she's around
Can't wait until her parents go out of town
I fell in love with the girl at the rock show
Black and white picture of her on my wall
I waited for her call, she always kept me waiting
And if I ever got another chance, I'd still ask her to dance
Because she kept me waiting
Because I fell in love with the girl at the rock show
She said what? And I told her that I didn't know
She's so cool, better sneak in through her window
Everything's better when she's around
Can't wait until her parents go out of town
I fell in love with the girl at the rock show
