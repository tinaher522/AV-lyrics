<song artist="Blink-182" title="Pretty_Little_Girl">
Nineteen your eyes glow into my beating heart.
Oh it seems like it is fun as my hand is moving up your arm 
And you never really know where it goes until it starts.
I’ve got my eye on you
Whatcha gonna do?
Day dream, near a stream with a winter bite.
Oh I listen to the song on repeat From the other night
And I can’t picture you but I sure got the feeling right
What a crazy world
Pretty little girl
And we wait in the night in a bed with a bruise
And we’re laughing out loud over the craziest news
And you reach for my hand, I was scared in your room.
We fell on the floor and we started to move.
And your hands were like birds as they flew from the coop.
Up my back they would climb just as I came unglued.
She said
If you break my heart then I'll change your mind
And I will do it again
If you play the part then I will play mine
And I will do it again
If we miss the mark if we hold on tight
We’ll be there to try it again.
Nineteen and you roll across the bedroom floor
Your eyes they cannot lie as you’re dreaming of our future home
And the kids are growing up as you and I we are growing old
What a crazy world
Pretty little girl
In the rain with the drink from the back of a bar.
I would raise up my voice you would raise it up more
We would forget that our lives means apart, it is hard.
I thought we were close but it still feels far.
Can we learn to get by if we learn to have scars?
We learn to forgive and accept who we are.
She said
If you break my heart then I'll change your mind
And I will do it again
If you play the part then I will play mine
And I will do it again
If we miss the mark if we hold on tight
We’ll be there to do it again.
Wait a minute, hold up a second.
Don’t leave me here with this feeling,
Like I’m the one for regretting.
Like I never did cope foe us both,
Like a never did pull out that weapon
And stick that knife in my back.
Was I supposed to accept it?
When your words are like…
More than just sticks and stones, Kind of like a bullet.
A hollow tip that’s lodged in my bones, and I can’t just swallow it.
My pride is more than all that, I own so I gotta give it away.
And some of the times I’m all of the way wrong,
But can’t you see past me and see my fucked up home.
That made me the meanest.
The devill is just singing along to song that I write to the
Morning night and I hang up the phone and bite my tongue
Because I know that me and you is just only right but one
(One, one, one)
It’s a cry from that past, we have been through a lot.
Every year has been great, and few have been tough.
And the kids, they will reach for the stars up above.
We’ ll sit and relax as we’re cheering them on.
All the roads to the light from the crib to the grave.
We stared alone, in the end we’re ok.
She said
If you break my heart then I'll change your mind
And I will do it again
If you play the part then I will play mine
And I will do it again
If we miss the mark if we hold on tight
We’ll be there to try it again.
