<song artist="Blink-182" title="Guy_On_The_Playground">
Hanging out behind the skool for the weekend
Acting stupid, being goofs with my best friends
We couldn't wait for the winter and the snowballs
I remember that it's the first time that I saw him there
He got kiked out of math cuz hes laffing
He's getting yelled at in GYM for fucking napping
He's the one he'll always be there
I'm really sorry but it's not Pierre
Cuz I fell in love 
With the guy on the play ground
He said what?
And I almost fainted to the ground
He's so kool
When he speaks there's not another sound
Cuz everything's better when he's around
He's better than napping in the lost and found
I fell in love with the guy on the playground
When we said we were gonna play some dodge ball
I remember he got sent out to the wall
Nothing better than to sit and just waste it
But fuck he better know how to escape it
Cuz I fell in love 
With the guy on the play ground
He said what?
And I almost fainted to the ground
He's so kool
When he speaks there's not another sound
Cuz everything's better when he's around
He's better than napping in the lost and found
I fell in love with the guy on the playground 
Got his class picture up there on my wall
He's never gonna call
He'll always be out skating
And if he ever gets another chance
He won't ask me to dance
He'll just keep fucking skating 
I fell in love 
With the guy on the play ground
He said what?
And I almost fainted to the ground
He's so kool
When he speaks there's not another sound
Cuz everything's better when he's around
He's better than napping in the lost and found
I fell in love with the guy on the playground
I'll never forget last week. (the guy on the playground)
I'll never forget last week. (the guy on the playground) 
I'll never forget last week. (the guy on the playground) 
I'll never forget last week.
