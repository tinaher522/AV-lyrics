<song artist="The_Wanted" title="Drunk_On_Love">
Nathan:
We’re drunk on love
So turn the music up
I wanna lose control
We’re gonna lose control
We going out tonight
Going with no invite
I want to take it all
We’re gonna take it all
Jay:
I’m a lover not a hater
Not a fighter or a player
And I’ll party 'til the sun comes up
Getting a hangover without a cure
We could end up anywhere
But that’s all part of the rush
All:
When the lights are shining
That’s where you will find me
Getting drunk on love
That’s what we do
When I see you dancing
Gets me so excited
Girl, I pour my love
All over you
We’re drunk on love
We’re drunk on love
Siva:
We’re drunk on love
We’re going to light it up
The fire never ends
This fire never ends
And when tomorrow comes
We’re gonna hear those drums
We’ll do it all again
Let’s do it all again
Tom:
I’m a lover not a hater
Not a fighter or a player
And I’ll party 'til the sun comes up
Getting a hangover without a cure
We could end up anywhere
But that’s all part of the rush
All:
When the lights are shining
That’s where you will find me
Getting drunk on love
That’s what we do
When I see you dancing
Gets me so excited
Girl, I pour my love
All over you
We’re drunk on love
We’re drunk on love
Jay:
When the lights are shining
That’s where you will find me
Getting drunk on love
That’s what we do
When I see you dancing
Gets me so excited
Girl, I pour my love
All over you
All:
When the lights are shining
That’s where you will find me
Getting drunk on love
That’s what we do
When I see you dancing
Gets me so excited
Girl, I pour my love
All over you
We’re drunk on love
We’re drunk on love
