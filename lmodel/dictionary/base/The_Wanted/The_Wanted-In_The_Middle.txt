Max:
When I was young
I read stories where princes won
As I grew up
I thought the stories were wrong
But to you, girl
I am faithful
I've fallen so hard that itâ€™s painful
When it hurts I know the feeling's are real
Tom:
I'll let nothing in the middle
Nothing in the middle
Of me and you, me and you
Nothing in the middle, in the middle of us
Max:
I love the way we fight and stay up all night
And the way you look in the morning light
I'll let nothing in the middle
In the middle of us
Nathan:
I don't know
How the story of us unfolds
Or if when we're old
We'll still be together at all
Jay:
But to you, girl
I am faithful
I've fallen so hard that it's painful
And when it hurts, I know the feelings are real
Max:
I'll let nothing in the middle
Nothing in the middle
Of me and you, me and you
Oh, nothing in the middle, in the middle of us
Tom:
I love the way we fight and stay up all night
And the way you look in the morning light
I'll let nothing in the middle
In the middle of us
Jay:
When I feel you breathe
In my arms at night
When I feel you breathe
As I hold you tight
I believe
We are meant to be
Meant to be
Max:
We are meant to be
Max:
When I was young
I read stories where princes won
As I grew up
I thought the stories were wrong
I'll let nothing in the middle
Nothing in the middle
Of me and you, me and you
Oh, nothing in the middle, in the middle of us
I love the way we fight and stay up all night
And the way you look in the morning light
I'll let nothing in the middle
In the middle of us
In the middle of us
