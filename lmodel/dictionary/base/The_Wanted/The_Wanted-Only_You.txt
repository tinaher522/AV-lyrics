Jay:
How can I
Hold a mirror up to your eyes?
Speak the way
You can understand what’s inside
You've been broken down
In a thousand different ways
I've been looking over pictures
And you hardly looked the same
I can see it from a mile
That the way you smile is changed
But you don’t know
Nathan:
It is hard for me to sit
And watch you getting sick
When all I wanna do is try
All:
Only you can dig yourself out
Just before you break down, girl, yeah
Only you can lift yourself up
Just before you get stuck, yeah
All of this pain spread all over your face
All I want to do is help you out of this place
Only you, so hurry up now
Just before you run out of time
Max:
Before you run out of time
Siva:
Beautiful
That’s the only way I see you
Nobody else
Can love you in the way that I do
Sometimes I get worried
That you are taking on too much
And this crazy world where we live
In doesn't really give a fuck
If only we could paddle
To a place when it was just you and I
Tom:
It is hard for me to sit
And watch you getting sick
When all I wanna do is try
All:
Only you can dig yourself out
Just before you break down, girl, yeah
Only you can lift yourself up
Just before you get stuck, yeah
All of this pain spread all over your face
All I want to do is help you out of this place
Only you, so hurry up now
Jay:
Just before you run out of time
Before you run out of time
You can run out of time
You can run out of time
You can run out of time
Max:
Only you can dig yourself out
Just before you break down, girl, yeah
Only you can lift yourself up
Just before you get stuck, yeah
All:
Only you can dig yourself out
Just before you break down, girl, yeah
Only you can lift yourself up
Just before you get stuck, yeah
All of this pain spread all over your face
All I want to do is help you out of this place
Only you, so hurry up now
Just before you run out of time
Max:
Before you run out of time
