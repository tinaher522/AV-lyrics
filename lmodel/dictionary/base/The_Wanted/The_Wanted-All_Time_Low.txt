<song artist="The_Wanted" title="All_Time_Low">
Max:
Praying won't do it,
Hating won't do it,
Drinking won't do it,
Fighting won't knock you out,
Of my head.
Tom:
Hiding won't hide it,
Smiling won't hide it,
Like I ain't tried it,
Everyone's tried it now,
And failed somehow.
Jay:
So when you gonna let me
When you gonna let me out, out?
Nathan and Siva:
And if you know 
How do you get up from an all time low?
I'm in pieces, 
It seems like peace is,
The only thing I'll never know,
How do you get out, get out?
Tom and Siva:
Cause drivin' won't do it,
Flyin' won't do it,
Denyin' won't do it,
Crying won't drown it out,
What you said.
Jay and Siva:
When I'm standin' on the yellow line,
Waitin' at the station,
Or I'm late for work,
A vital presentation,
If you call me now girl,
Without reservation,
I will try to break through.
All:
But if you know 
How do you get up from an all time low?
I'm in pieces,
It seems like peace is,
The only I never know,
How do you get up from an all time low?
Max:
I can't even find a place to start,
How do I choose between my head and heart?
'Til it ceases I'll never know,
How do you get up from an all time low?
A low, a low, a low
Can you hear me?
A low, a low, a low
Can't you hear me?
A low, a low, a low
Can you hear me?
A low, a low, a low
All:
And if you know
How do you get up from an all time low?
I'm in pieces,
It seems like peace is,
The only thing I'll never know
How do you get up from an all time low?
Max:
I can't even find a place to start,
How do I choose between my head and heart,
'Til it ceases I'll never know,
How do you get up from an all time low.
I can't even find a place to start,
How do I choose between my head and heart,
Till it ceases I'll never know, 
How do you get you get up from an all time low.
