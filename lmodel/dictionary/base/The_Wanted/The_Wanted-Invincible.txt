<song artist="The_Wanted" title="Invincible">
Max:
Tonight could be forgettable
Cause I'm drinking all the alcohol
Girl I'm throwing away my soul
I'm forgetting everything that's cool
'Cause I like it like that
Yeah I like it like that
Yeah I like it like that
Yeah I like it like that
Tonight I feel invincible
Nathan:
Tonight I feel invincible
Just please don't tell the principal
The feeling's irresistible
In detention getting physical
'Cause I like it like that
Yeah I like it like that
Yeah I like it like that
Yeah I like it like that
Tonight I feel invincible
Jay:
Tonight I feel unstoppable
And anything is possible
'Cause we are uncontrollable
And we don't do predictable
'Cause I like it like that
Yeah I like it like that
Nathan:
Yeah I like it like that
Yeah I like it like that
'Cause I like it like that
Siva:
Tonight could be forgettable
Cause I'm drinking all the alcohol
Girl I'm throwing away my soul
I'm forgetting everything that's cool
'Cause I like it like that
Yeah I like it like that
Tonight I feel invincible
