<song artist="The_Wanted" title="Chasing_The_Sun">
Tom:
I'm better
So much better now
I see the light, touch the light,
We're together now
I'm better
So much better now
Look to the skies, give me life
We're together now
Max:
We've only just begun
Hypnotized by drums
Until forever comes
You'll find us chasing the sun
Nathan:
They said this day wouldn't come
We refused to run
We've only just begun
Tom:
You'll find us chasing the sun
All:
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Tom:
You'll find us chasing the sun
All:
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Tom:
You'll find us chasing the sun
All:
When the daylight's fading
We're gonna play in the dark
Till it's golden again
And now it feels so amazing
Can see you coming?
And we'll never grow old again
Tom:
You'll find us chasing the sun
Siva:
I'm never
I'm never down
Lying here, staring up
And you're looking down
Jay:
I'm never
I'm never down
Live forever, forever
With you around
Nathan:
We've only just begun
Hypnotized by drums
Until forever comes
You'll find us chasing the sun
Tom:
They said this day wouldn't come
We refused to run
We've only just begun
You'll find us chasing the sun
The sun, the sun, the sun
You'll find us chasing the sun
All:
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Tom:
You'll find us chasing the sun
All:
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Tom:
You'll find us chasing the sun
All:
When the daylight's fading
We're gonna play in the dark
Till it's golden again
And now it feels so amazing
Can see you coming?
And we'll never grow old again
Siva:
You'll find us chasing the sun
Tom:
Chasing the sun
Nathan:
Chasing the sun
Siva:
You'll find us chasing the sun
Tom:
You'll find us chasing the sun
All:
When the daylight's fading
We're gonna play in the dark
Till it's golden again
And now it feels so amazing
Can see you coming
And We'll never grow old again
Tom:
You'll find us chasing the sun
All:
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Tom:
You'll find us chasing the sun
All:
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Tom:
You'll find us chasing the sun
