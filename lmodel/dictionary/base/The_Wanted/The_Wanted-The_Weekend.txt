Nathan:
I just want you for the weekend.
I need you like the beat inside my head.
I just want you for the weekend.
I know I’m gonna see your face again.
Tom:
Come here right now girl,
I’ll make you sweat like you've worked out,
Then we’ll down a drink or two,
You won’t know what I’ll put you through.
All:
I just want you for the weekend.
I need you like the beat inside my head.
I just want you for the weekend.
I know I’m gonna see your face again.
Nathan:
Let’s get down and some more.
Then we’ll take it to the floor.
So make your body close to mine,
Girl you’re looking fine.
Now for the last time...
All:
I just want you for the weekend.
I need you like the beat inside my head.
I just want you for the weekend.
I know I’m gonna see your face again.
Jay:
Come here right now girl,
I’ll make you sweat like you've worked out,
Then we’ll down a drink or two,
You won’t know what I’ll put you through.
All:
I just want you for the weekend.
I need you like the beat inside my head.
I just want you for the weekend.
I know I’m gonna see your face again.
Tom:
I know I’m gonna see your face again.
I know I’m gonna see your face again.
