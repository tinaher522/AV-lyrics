<song artist="The_Wanted" title="We_Own_The_Night">
Max:
May our hearts be full like our drinks tonight
May we sing and dance 'til we lose our minds
We are only young if we seize the night
Tonight we own the night
Tonight we own the night
All:
La la la la la
La la la la la
Max:
When my time is over, lying in my grave
Written on my tombstone, I want it to say
Tom:
This man was a legend, a legend of his time
When he was at a party, the party never died
Nathan:
Hey, everybody's got a dream so what do you say
Are we making history?
All:
May our hearts be full like our drinks tonight
May we sing and dance till we lose our minds
We are only young if we seize the night
Tonight we own the night
Tonight we own the night
La la la la la
La la la la la
Jay:
For tonight I'm famous, for tonight I'm king
And I will be remembered for centuries, they'll say
Tom:
This man was a hero, a hero of the night
When he was at a party, the party never died
Nathan:
Hey, I'm a little drunk, but I got something to say
All:
May our hearts be full like our drinks tonight
May we sing and dance till we lose our minds
We are only young if we seize the night
Tonight we own the night
And let us wake up inside of stranger's bed
Let us drink until there is nothing left
And this night, my friends, we will not forget
Tonight we own the night
Tonight we own the night
Siva:
May our hearts be full like our drinks tonight
May we sing and dance till we lose our minds
Max:
We are only young if we seize the night
Tonight we own the night
Tonight we own the night
