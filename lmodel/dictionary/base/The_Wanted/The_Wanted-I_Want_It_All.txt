<song artist="The_Wanted" title="I_Want_It_All">
Siva:
Take a moment, listen please
Words like these don't come with ease
You took my heart and kept it low
Now it's time to let it go
Max:
I want it all or nothing at all, to have you here
Some people fall to hold on to their tears
And if you want it all, I'd do anything to see you through
And if I fall my heart holds on to you
Siva:
Just one look and I'll subside
When I'm with you my love can't hide
Take a chance, don't run away
With every breath I need to say
Max:
I want it all or nothing at all, to have you here
Some people fall to hold on to their tears
And if you want it all, I'll do anything to see this through
And if I fall my heart holds on to you
