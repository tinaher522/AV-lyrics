<song artist="The_Wanted" title="Golden">
Max:
Don’t live in black and white, do we?
It’s just another fight to me 
If we don’t take it on we won’t get far
It seems so far away but so close 
It’s there for us to take when most 
Would waste it, don’t waste it
All:
And we try and we fall 
And we live another day 
And we rise like a phoenix 
From the flames 
And it burns but it turns out golden
Jay:
We loved to dream aloud 
With both feet on the ground 
But where’s the sense in that?
We’d never get it back 
We’d be wasted 
Nathan:
We’d be wasted
All:
And we try and we fall 
And we live another day 
And we rise like a phoenix 
From the flames 
And it burns but it turns out golden 
And went for the sky 
And we fell down low 
And flew too high 
But we still survived 'cause you and I 
We turned out Golden
Tom:
They tore it to pieces 
We’ll build it again 
Siva:
Ah ah ah ah 
Ah ah ah ah
All:
And we try and we fall 
And we live another day 
And we rise like a phoenix 
From the flames 
And it burns but it turns out golden 
And went for the sky 
And fell down low 
And flew too high 
But we still survived 'cause you and I 
We turned out Golden
