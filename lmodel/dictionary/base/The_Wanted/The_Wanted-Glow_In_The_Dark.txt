<song artist="The_Wanted" title="Glow_In_The_Dark">
Yeah
I was on it from the get go
The way you stood out from the crowd
Still shining with the lights low
Even when the sun goes go down
When you move
My eyes are locked on you
So I'm stuck, I'm hypnotized
It's the way you shine
'Cause it's like
The strobe lights not as bright as you are
You're the only one that I can see from afar
And I follow the rays till I get to your heart
I just gotta know who you are
You glow in the dark
You glow in the dark
You glow in the dark
You glow in the dark
I can see you
[Beat break]
Glow in the dark
Shocking like electro
The way you put it down
I should've came here with my shades on
'Cause I'm blinded by you now
When you move
My eyes are locked on you
So I'm stuck, I'm hypnotized
It's the way you shine
'Cause it's like
The strobe lights not as bright as you are
You're the only one that I can see from afar
And I follow the rays till I get to your heart
I just gotta know who you are
You glow in the dark
You glow in the dark
You glow in the dark
You glow in the dark
I can see you
[Beat break]
Glow in the dark
Glow in the dark [x6]
