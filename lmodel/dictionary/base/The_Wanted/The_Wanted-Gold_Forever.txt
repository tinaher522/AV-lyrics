Tom:
Say my name like it's the last time,
Live today like it's your last night,
Max:
We want to cry, but we know its alright,
Cause I'm with you and you're with me,
Nathan:
Butterflies, butterflies
We were meant to fly
You and I, you and I
Colours in the sky,
We could rule the world someday, somehow 
But we'll never be as bright as we are now.
Max:
We're standing in a light that won't fade,
Tomorrow's coming but this won't change,
'Cause some days stay gold forever.
The memory of being here with you,
Is one I'm gonna take my life through,
'Cause some days stay gold forever.
Siva:
Promise me you'll stay the way you are,
Keep the fire alive and stay young at heart,
Nathan:
When the storm feels like it could blow you out
Remember, you got me and I got you
'Cause we are..
Jay:
Butterflies, butterflies
We were meant to fly
You and I, you and I
Colours in the sky,
When the innocence is dead and gone
These will be the times we look back on
Max:
We're standing in a light that won't fade,
Tomorrow's coming but this won't change,
'Cause some days stay gold forever.
The memory of being here with you,
Is one I'm gonna take my life through,
'Cause some days stay gold forever.
Tom:
I won't, I won't let your memory go 
'Cause your colours they burn so bright,
Who knows, who knows what tomorrow will hold 
But I know that we'll be alright
'Cause we're butterflies, butterflies
We were meant to fly
You and I, you and I
Colours in the sky,
We could rule the world someday, somehow 
But we'll never be as bright as we are now.
Max:
We're standing in a light that won't fade,
Tomorrow's coming but this won't change,
'Cause some days stay gold forever.
The memory of being here with you,
Is one I'm gonna take my life through,
'Cause some days stay gold forever.
