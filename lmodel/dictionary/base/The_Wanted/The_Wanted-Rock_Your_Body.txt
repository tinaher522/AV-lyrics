Nathan:
Breathe a sigh and push tonight
Open your eyes and let the light
Take you away, forget the day
The hit makes you fizz something you gotta say
Tom:
And I can still see the old days in your face
We have grown and we own it all
Max:
This is a rave, not a grave
Everyone head to the light
'Cause we are not, not afraid
Of pushing the limit tonight
All:
We're gonna rock your body
Let's get on it
The beat of your heart will ignite
We're gonna shock your body
CPR it
The dead won't be sleeping tonight
Oh, oh, oh
Jay:
Take a risk and feel the rush
It's just begun a change in us
Open your mind, your mind, your mind
And don't you be worried about what you find
And I can still see the old days in your face
Tom:
We have grown and we own it all
Max:
This is a rave, not a grave
Everyone head to the light
Cause we are not, not afraid
Of pushing the limit tonight
All:
We're gonna rock your body
Let's get on it
The beat of your heart will ignite
We're gonna shock your body
CPR it
The dead won't be sleeping tonight
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Nathan:
This is a rave, not a grave
This is a rave, not a grave
We are not, not afraid
All:
We're gonna rock your body
Let's get on it
The beat of your heart will ignite
We're gonna shock your body
CPR it
The dead won't be sleeping tonight
We're gonna rock your body
Let's get on it
The beat of your heart will ignite
We're gonna shock your body
CPR it
The dead won't be sleeping tonight
We're gonna rock your body
Let's get on it
The beat of your heart will ignite
We're gonna shock your body
CPR it
The dead won't be sleeping
The dead won't be sleeping tonight.
