Max:
I'm pretty sure you've heard of me
I'm a local celebrity
But not the kind you look to Hollywood for
Tom:
No flashing lights or autographs
In fact, people avoid me if they can
I got no fence hanging right outside of my door
Nathan:
And I hear them whispering when I pass
Saying to each other is that the man?
With a broken heart
'Cause you tore it apart
All:
And now everybody knows my name
Everybody feels my pain
But you don't even care
You're so unaware
I'm left to deal with the shame
Now everybody knows that I'm
Just a bum without you by my side
Welcome to the show
Everybody knows
Tom:
Everyone but you
Everyone but you
Nathan:
I got a thousand friends that follow me
Just to read about my misery
I'm popular for reasons that I hate
Yeah, yeah, and I 
Max:
Strike up the conversation
Most time a total stranger
Anyone who listens to my fate
Nathan:
But they shake their heads and they walk away
And all I'm left with is this fame
And a broken heart
'Cause you tore it apart
All:
And now everybody knows my name
Everybody feels my pain
But you don't even a care
You're so unaware
I'm left to deal with the shame
Now everybody knows that I'm
Just a bum without you by my Sid
Welcome to the show
Everybody knows
Nathan:
Everyone but you
Everyone but you
Everyone but you
Now if I die again would you even come?
Written on my grave will say here lies someone
With a broken heart
'Cause she tore it apart
All:
Everybody knows my name
Everybody feels my pain
But you don't even a care
You're so unaware
I'm left to deal with the shame
Now everybody knows that I'm
Just a bum without you by my side
Welcome to the show
Everybody knows
Nathan:
Everyone but you
Everyone but you
Everyone but you
Max:
I'm pretty sure you've heard of me
I'm a local celebrity
That all the people know
Everyone but you
