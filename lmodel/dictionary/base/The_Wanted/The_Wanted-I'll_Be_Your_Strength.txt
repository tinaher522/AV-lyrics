Jay:
This is not gonna last forever
It’s a time where you must hold on.
And I won’t let you surrender,
And I’ll heal you if you’re broken.
Nathan:
We can stand so tall together.
We can make it through the stormy weather.
We can go through it all together, 
Do it all together, do it all.
I’ll be your strength.
I will, I will, I will.
I’ll be your strength.
Yes I will, yes I will.
Tom:
I won’t sleep 'til the sky is calmer,
Keep on searching 'til I find you.
And my love will be your armour,
In this battlefield around you.
Nathan:
Hand in hand we walk together,
We can make it through the stormy weather.
We can break down walls together, 
Do it all together, do it all.
I’ll be your strength.
I will, I will, I will.
I’ll be your strength.
Yes I will, yes I will.
All:
Hold on, hold on.
I’ll be, there soon.
So hold on, hold on,
I’ll be, there soon.
So hold on, hold on,
I’ll be, there soon.
So hold on, hold on,
I’ll be, there...
Nathan:
I’ll be your strength.
I will, I will be.
I’ll be your strength.
I’ll be, I’ll be
I’ll be your strength.
I’ll be, I’ll be
I’ll be your strength.
I’ll be, I’ll be
Max:
I’ll be your strength.
I’ll be strong for you
I’ll be your strength.
And I’ll keep strong for you.
