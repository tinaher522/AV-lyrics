<song artist="The_Wanted" title="Nice_Straight_Row">
If Nathan won't do it
If Tom won't do it
And Jay won't do it
Then go for Siva's model pout instead
If Max didnt hide it
If Nathan didn't hide it
Then why can't I find it
All the guys have tried it on now
And looked wrong somehow
So I'm getting my pout ready 
Getting my pout ready now
It's a band photo
We gotta get into a nice straight row
Hope you can't see the creases and they've ordered the pizzas 
Being a heart-throb ain't easy you know
Guess what time we get up get up now
Cause Max won't wash it 
And Jay won't wipe it 
Don't mean to drop it
But cleaning just drives us out 
Of our heads
When I'm handed pictures to sign and I'm trying to be patient
But girls all go berserk for their screaming adoration
Because they say it helps. 
It's to maximize flirtation but I must get back to this shoot
This bit's slow mo, then we get back into a nice straight row
As our fame increases schedules on press releases
And so our fans already know exactly where to go now
I wonder if I'll be the solo star but I'm worried if I do depart
Then my place in the band will go 
And it'll break up our nice straight row 
Row row row row row 
We're all standing 
Slow mo slow mo slow mo
It's a band photo we gotta get into a nice straight row
How you cant see the creases and they've ordered the pizzas 
Being a heart-throb ain't easy you know
Guess what time we get up get up now
