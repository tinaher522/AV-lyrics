<song artist="The_Wanted" title="The_Way_I_Feel">
Tom:
Yeah I'm not dead 
I'm alive, I survived
While falling apart at the seams
Yeah I have grown 
I'm alone, I have flown
To the far away land of my dreams
Give me a little chance
To show you what I've learned
I will explain the circumstance
In which I have returned
All:
'Cause I can't forget you
Lose or reject you
Now that I've found our love is real
I don't wanna break you
Force or complicate you
That is the way that I feel
Siva:
Yeah it was fate to wait, hesitate
Finding some time on our own
They won't believe
That the joy that we need
Was so very far from our home
Tom:
Give me a little chance
To show you what I've learned
I will explain the circumstance
In which I have returned
All:
'Cause I canâ€™t forget you
Lose or reject you
Now that I've found our love is real
I try to accept you
Love and protect you
That is the way that I feel
Tom:
We will go on
Like the moon and the sun
Revolving around the earth
All:
'Cause I can't forget you
Lose or reject you
Now that I've found our love is real
I try to accept you
Love and protect you
That is the way that I feel
