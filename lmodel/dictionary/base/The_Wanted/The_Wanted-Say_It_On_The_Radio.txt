Jay:
I see you walk away walk away 
So why you looking back at me like that, like that?
If you're not messing with, messing with me
Then why you go on and kiss me like that, like that?
My head is killing me, killing me girl 
Are you telling me stay or go?
All:
If I can't have you 
Why won't you let me go?
If you don't want me 
Say it on the radio 
So go on, go on, go on, just play it 
Come on, come on, come on, you'll never say it
That you don't want me 
‘Cause you can't let me go, me go
Max:
Monday and you're all over me 
Now it's Friday and you're MIA 
And if you're letting go, letting go, me
Then why you go on and hold me that way, that way?
The chase is killing me killing me girl 
Now I'm telling you stay or go
All:
If I can't have you 
Why won't you let me go?
If you don't want me 
Say it on the radio 
So go on, go on, go on, just play it 
Come on, come on, come on, you'll never say it
That you don't want me 
‘Cause you can't let me go, me go
Tom:
Now I've gone and said it all 
Now I'm here out in the open 
Don't say another time,
Another place, another face
All:
If I can't have you 
Why won't you let me go? 
If you don't want me 
Say it on the radio 
So go on, go on, go on, just play it 
Come on, come on, come on, you'll never say it
That you don't want me 
‘Cause you can't let me go, me go
‘Cause you can't let me go 
So go on, go on, go on
Say it on the radio
