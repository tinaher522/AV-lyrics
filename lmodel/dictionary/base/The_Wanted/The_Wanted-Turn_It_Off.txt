<song artist="The_Wanted" title="Turn_It_Off">
Jay:
Stop, look, listen what I’m saying
Don’t push, haven’t got to chase it
Just me, I don’t have to fake it
Never gonna change it, I don’t have to fake it
Tom:
Back off, back off, you won't get very far
Back off, back off I think you think you’re a star
Back off, back off, I don’t know who you are
I think you think you’re a star, you’re a star!
Max:
There’s something bad in you
Makes me wanna scream
I’d like it out of my mind so,
I can’t hear a thing
I'm about to tell you what I mean
Turn it off, off, I turn it off!
Siva:
Fast cars, smooth talk, Flash watch (Jay: turn it off!)
Fake hair, fake tan, Lip gloss (Jay: turn it off)
Hot shot, who cares?
Cause I just don’t give a damn
Jay:
Turn it off, off!
I turn it off!
Jay:
Time moves, seems like nothing's changing
VIP isn't that amazing
So seen, but it doesn't faze me
Never gonna change me, no it doesn't faze me
Tom:
Back off, back off, you won't get very far
Back off, back off I think you think you’re a star
Back off, back off, I don’t know who you are
I think you think you’re a star, you’re a star!
Max:
There’s something bad in you
Makes me wanna scream
I’d like it out of my mind so
I can’t hear a thing
I'm about to tell you what I mean
Turn it off, off, I turn it off!
Siva:
Fast cars, smooth talk, flash watch (Jay: turn it off!)
Fake hair, fake tan, Lip gloss (Jay: turn it off!)
Hot shot, who cares?
Cause I just don’t give a damn
Jay:
Turn it off, off!
I turn it off!
Never gonna change me,
No it doesn’t faze me!
Turn it off!
Never gonna change me,
No it doesn’t faze me!
Turn it off!
Max:
There’s something bad in you
Makes me wanna scream
I’d like it out of my mind so
I can’t hear a thing
I'm about to tell you what I mean
Turn it off, off, I turn it off!
Fast cars, smooth talk, flash watch (Jay: turn it off!)
Fake hair, fake tan, Lip gloss (Jay: turn it off!)
Hot shot, who cares?
'Cause I just don’t give a damn
Jay:
Turn it off, off!
Turn it off!
Never gonna change me,
No it doesn’t faze me!
Turn it off!
Never gonna change me,
No it doesn’t faze me!
Turn it off!
