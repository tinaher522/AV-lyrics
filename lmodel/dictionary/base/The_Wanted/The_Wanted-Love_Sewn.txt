Tom:
Yeah, we fell, we fell so hard, we sold out
Yeah, we fray and fade away, we never cut loose
There’s nobody but you
Nobody else, nobody else
Yeah, we feel, we feel all of the same things
You find, you find all of my secrets
Locked up deep inside of me
I know you're always right, always right
So save your words, I’m bleeding inside
You see the hurt, nowhere left to hide
And all this time you're slipping away from me
Bring me to my knees
Max:
Now I’m lying on the floor
With no one else to blame
Torn apart and knowing
That I’ll mess it up again
Now I don’t recognize
Just what we used to be
And I can see us
Tearing at the seams
Tom:
We cover up the scars
And never let them go
Stitch up our broken hearts
This love is sewn
This love is sewn
Max:
Yeah, we try, we try to leave them behind
All our mistakes, we stumble though a million fights
Every time we twist the knife
We forgive, never forget, never forget
Tom:
So save your words, I’m bleeding inside
You see the hurt, nowhere left to hide
And all this time you're slipping away from me
Bring me to my knees
Max:
Now I’m lying on the floor
With no one else to blame
Torn apart and knowing
That I’ll mess it up again
Now I don’t recognize
Just what we used to be
And I can see us
Tearing at the seams
Tom:
We cover up the scars
And never let them go
Stitch up our broken hearts
This love is sewn
Max:
This love is sewn
This love is sewn
This love is sewn
Tom:
This love is sewn
Nathan:
Yeah, we fell, we fell so hard, we sold out
Yeah, we fray and fade away, we never cut loose
There’s nobody but you
Nobody else
Max:
Now I’m lying on the floor
With no one else to blame
Torn apart and knowing
That I’ll mess it up again
Now I don’t recognize
Just what we used to be
And I can see us
Tearing at the seams
Tom:
We cover up the scars
And never let them go
Stitch up our broken hearts
This love is sewn
All:
This love is sewn
This love is sewn
This love is sewn
This love is sewn
This love is sewn
This love is sewn
This love is sewn
Tom:
This love is sewn
