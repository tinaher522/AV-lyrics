<song artist="The_Wanted" title="Summer_Alive">
Tom:
I might have drank too much
Electric eyes, I feel the rush
You're my drug, can't get enough
Oh oh oh oh
Jay:
I want to dance until it feels
Like time is standing still
Forget the world, just let me in, I feel so
Oh oh oh oh
All:
Having the time of my life
With you keeping the summer alive
Want to give you forever tonight
Always keeping the summer alive
Bang on the drum, under the sun
All night long, under the moonlight
Bang on the drum, under the sun
All night long, under the moonlight
Bang on the drum, under the sun
All night long, under the moonlight
Bang on the drum, under the sun
All night long, all night long
Max:
You take me off the sand
And fly me where I want to land
Nathan:
It's like this beat will never end, I feel so
Oh oh oh oh
All:
Having the time of my life
With you keeping the summer alive
Want to give you forever tonight
Always keeping the summer alive
Having the time of my life
With you keeping the summer alive
Want to give you forever tonight
Always keeping the summer alive
Bang on the drum, under the sun
All night long, under the moonlight
Bang on the drum, under the sun
All night long, all night long
Bang on the drum, under the sun
All night long, under the moonlight
Bang on the drum, under the sun
All night long, under the moonlight
Bang on the drum, under the sun
All night long, under the moonlight
Bang on the drum, under the sun
All night long, all night long
Bang on the drum
All night long, under the moonlight
Bang on the drum
All night long, under the moonlight
Bang on the drum
All night long, under the moonlight
Bang on the drum
All night long, all night long
