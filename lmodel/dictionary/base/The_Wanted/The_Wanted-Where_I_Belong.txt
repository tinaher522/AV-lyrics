<song artist="The_Wanted" title="Where_I_Belong">
Siva:
I'm on my own and the road is long
I'll do what it takes
Just finding a place
Where I belong
Being down not out
Being lost not found
No words, no sound
On this lonely track
The wind can roll,
The storm can rage
It's all the same
I'm not turning back
Over night things can change, always
I'm on my own and the road is long
I'll do what it takes
Just finding a place
Where I belong
Dusty tracks kicking on and on
Not a coin to my name
Just finding a place
Where I belong
No chains to break
No walls to climb
Just space and time waiting for me
No cares, no fares,
No shame, no pride
Just stars to guide where I need to be
Over night things can change, always
I'm on my own and the road is long
I'll do what it takes
Just finding a place
Where I belong
dusty tracks kicking off and on
not a coin to my name
Just finding a place
Where I belong
Where I belong
Where I belong
I'm on my own and the road is long
I'll do what it takes
Just finding a place
Dusty tracks kicking on and on
Not a coin to my name
Just finding a place
Where I belong
I'm on my own (where I belong)
And the road is long (where I belong)
I'll do what it takes (where I belong)
Just finding a place (where I belong)
Dusty tracks (where I belong) kicking on and on (where I belong)
Not a coin to my name (where I belong)
Just finding a place
Where I belong
