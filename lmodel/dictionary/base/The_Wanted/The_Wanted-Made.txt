Tom:
You could hurt with the words, 
You could change my life, 
You could tell me the truth, 
It would cut like a knife but I won't let go
But I won't let go, but I won't let go
Max:
You could fall, hit the wall
You could lose your way
You could lose, you could bruise,
Spend it all in day but I won't let go
But I won't let go, but I won't let go
Nathan:
'Cause if I had to save someone, I'd still save you
And if I had to pray for someone, I'd pray for you
All:
'Cause you know we are made for each other
Can't take that away, made for each other
Like sunshine and day, made for each other, I'm here to stay
'Cause you know we are made for each other
I'm made for you, made for each other
Like stars and the moon, made for each other
We'll see it through 
'Cause you know we are made
Tom:
They could take, they could hate
They could break our hearts
They could try all they want, 
Never tear us apart, we will not let go, 
We will not let go, we will not let go
Nathan:
'Cause if I had to save someone, I'd still save you
And if I had to pray for someone, I'd pray for you
All:
'Cause you know we are made for each other
Can't take that away, made for each other
Like sunshine and day, made for each other, I'm here to stay
'Cause you know we are made for each other
I'm made for you, made for each other
Like stars and the moon, made for each other
We'll see it through
Siva:
'Cause you know we are made, made, made, made
Our love it won't fade, fade, fade, fade
We just gotta be brave, brave, brave, brave
You know we are made, made, made, made
All:
'Cause you know we are made for each other
Can't take that away, made for each other
Like sunshine and day, made for each other, I'm here to stay
'Cause you know we are made for each other
I'm made for you, made for each other
Like stars and the moon, made for each other
We'll see it through 
Siva:
'Cause you know we are made...
