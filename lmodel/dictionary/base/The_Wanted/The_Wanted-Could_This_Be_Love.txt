Max:
She takes my breath away
She's got me calling everyday
I can't seem to get enough
Could this be love?
Stay up 'til late at night
Watch the stars burst into light
Watch movies all the time
We can't get enough
Jay:
I'd jump out of a plane
Write your name in the sky
You're shaking my life up
All:
Could this be love?
I'm feeling drifting up
On ceilings with your touch
Could this be love, love, love?
'Cause when we kiss
My heart drops like a bomb
I'm in pieces when you're gone
Could this be love, love, love?
Max:
Could this be love?
Tom:
Sat in bed, we're on the phone
Her voice is sweet, she doesn't know
Could stay awake all night long
Could this be love?
Nathan:
Walk together through the night
Sky is clear, the stars are bright
I kiss her lips and hold her tight
Is that enough?
Jay:
I'd jump out of a plane
Write your name in the sky
You're shaking my life up
Max:
Let's take a chance on this time
Could be the best of our lives
I think we already know
All:
Could this be love?
I'm feeling drifting up
On ceilings with your touch
Could this be love, love, love?
'Cause when we kiss
My heart drops like a bomb
I'm in pieces when you're gone
Could this be love, love, love?
Max:
Could this be love? (Nathan: Could this be love, love?)
Could this be love? (Nathan: Could this be love, love?)
Could this be love? (Nathan: Could this be love, love, yeah)
Could this be love?
Max:
She takes my breath away
She's got me calling everyday
I can't seem to get enough
Could this be love?
All:
Could this be love?
I'm feeling drifting up
On ceilings with your touch
Could this be love, love, love?
'Cause when we kiss
My heart drops like a bomb
I'm in pieces when you're gone
Could this be love Love, love?
Tom:
Could this be love? (Nathan: Could this be love, love?)
Max:
Could this be love? (Nathan: Could this be love, love?)
Tom:
Could this be love? (Nathan: Could this be love, love, yeah)
Max:
Could this be love?
