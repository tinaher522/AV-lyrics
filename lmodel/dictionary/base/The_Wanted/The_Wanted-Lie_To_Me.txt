<song artist="The_Wanted" title="Lie_To_Me">
Jay:
Say it, though you're looking down and to the left, now
Say it, like someone who really means it
Do it, 'cause if you grow a conscience, now
We fall down
Tom:
Smiling, like there's nothing wrong
You're good at smiling, so keep it plastered on
Until the morning, 'cause if you shift to genuine
Then we'll fall out
And we fall down
All:
Don't say it's all for the better
Oh, I need you to lie, to lie to me
I'll stand for the greatest pretender
I know you won't die for me
But say you will
Just lie to me, to me
Nathan:
So kiss me and tell me I'm the one
There's no other, no other one you want
Baby, kiss me, make sure you close your eyes
Or we fall down
Yes, we fall down
All:
Don't say it's all for the better
Oh, I need you to lie, to lie to me
I'll stand for the greatest pretender
I know you won't die for me
But say you will
Just lie to me, to me
Nathan:
Now I can see, you bite your lip when you look at me
One word, you say, and everything is giving you away
Let's close our eyes and save the truth for one more night
Or I fall down
Or I fall down
Siva:
Don't say it's all for the better
I need you to lie, to lie to me
All:
I'll stand for the greatest pretender
I know you won't die for me
Don't say it's all for the better
Oh, I need you to lie, to lie to me
I'll stand for the greatest pretender
I know you won't die for me
But say you will
Just lie to me, to me
Don't say it's all for the better
Oh, I need you to lie, to lie to me
I'll stand for the greatest pretender
I know you won't die for me
