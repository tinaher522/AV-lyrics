Jay:
I'm gonna see some friends from outta state
The very trip that you were supposed to take a while ago
But it fell through
Like all of you
Like all of you
Thought I'd make the drive 
But a free plane ride is in the air
Just like that my fear of it disappeared 
Like all of you
Like all of you
And I looked high and low 
For yesterday 
High and low for you and I 
High and low
Once I can see straight 
I might move somewhere cold
Seattle or the Bay area
To see your ghost
What's left of you 
What's left of you
And I looked high and low 
For yesterday 
High and low 
For you and I 
High and low
Found a letter from a man.
A modern man
Addressed to you
And now I steal the words he ended with
I miss you
And I do
Miss you
And I do
High and low 
For yesterday 
High and low 
For you and I 
High and low
