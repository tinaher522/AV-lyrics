<song artist="The_Wanted" title="Lose_My_Mind">
Tom:
They say that time
Heals everything 
But they don't know you 
And the scars you bring
Max:
'Cause you left a jagged hole 
And I can't stand it anymore
All:
If heartache was a physical pain 
I could face it I could face it 
But you're hurting me 
From inside of my head 
I can't take it I can't take it
I'm gonna lose my mind 
I'm gonna lose my mind
Nathan:
I'd erase my thoughts
If only I knew how
Max:
Fill my head with white noise
If it would drown you out
Kill the sound
All:
If heartache was a physical pain 
I could face it I could face it 
But you're hurting me 
From inside of my head 
I can't take it, I can't take it
I'm gonna lose my mind 
I'm gonna lose my mind
Nathan:
And I'd rather be crazy
I'd rather go insane
Tom:
Than having you stalk my every thought
Then having you here inside my heart
All:
If heartache was a physical pain 
I could face it I could face it 
But you're hurting me 
From inside of my head 
I can't take it I can't take it
I'm gonna lose my mind 
I'm gonna lose my mind
