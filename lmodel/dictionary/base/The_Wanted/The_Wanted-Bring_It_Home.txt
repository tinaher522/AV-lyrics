We are we are we are we are
The only ones that can bring it
Bring it home we are we are we
Are we are the only ones
Dappy
This is an invasion the unwanted
Kind I'm all about domination that's
My state of mind I'm gonna build an
Empire so what's yours is mine we're
Gonna take it home tonight oh oh oh
Nathan
Let's make this one to remember we're
Blowing up the sky like the 5th of
November we don't stop cause we're impatient
The anticipation is pumpin' pumpin' pumpin'
Tom
Carry the light from the fire I can
See it burning in your eyes do or
Die we're crossing the light
There's no where left to hide
All
Tell me what you're waiting for
What you're living for
We're bringing it home oh oh oh
No one's left behind you're not alone
Cause we are we are we are we are the
Only ones that can bring it bring it
Home we are we are we are we are the
Only ones
Dappy
When I'm gone will you miss me? We'll
Find out in time I'm gonna go down
In history as the one who changed your
Mind they said that I'm dangerous so
What's yours is mine we're gonna take
It home tonight oh oh oh
Max
Lets make this one to remember we're
Blowing up the sky like the 5th of
November we don't stop cause we're
Impatient the anticipation is
Pumpin' pumpin' pumpin'
Siva
Carry the light from the fire
I can see it burning in your eyes
Do or die we're crossing the line
There's no where left to hide
All
Tell me what you're waiting for
What you're living for we're
Bringing it home oh oh oh
No one's left behind you're not alone
Cause we are we are we are we are
The only ones that can bring it
Bring it home we are we are we are
We are the only ones that can bring
It bring it home
Dappy
Right here where you're meant to be
I'm gonna get my hands on you
Officially I swear life's a bitch
And mine's called victory
That's why I always come first
Literally there ain't another like
Your kind all eyes on the prize
But you're mine never give up
On something you can't go a day without
Thinking about
Dappy
Just carry the light from the fire
I can see it burning in your eyes
Do or die we're crossing the line
There's no where left to hide
All
Tell me what you're waiting for
What you're living for we're
Bringing it home oh oh oh
No one's left behind your not alone
Cause we are we are we are we are
The only ones that can bring it
Bring it home we are we are we are
We are the only ones that can bring
It bring it home
