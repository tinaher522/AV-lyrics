<song artist="The_Wanted" title="Personal_Soldier">
All:
Left, left, left, right, left
Left, left, left, right, left
Nathan:
Tell me what's going on
I know there's something on your mind
Can you just open up? 
Do you feel like out of love?, 
Is somebody trying to hurt you?
Know I'd never let that happen, 
Must be out of their minds
Tom and Max:
'Cause you are the sunshine that makes my day
And I won't let them take that away,
All:
I'll be your hero whose standing strong
Who protects you from any fights
And if your battles are pilling on
I will take them on with all my might
Cry your tears on my shoulder
You don't know what the future holds
So I'll be your personal soldier
Left, left, left, right, left
Left, left, left, right, left
Siva:
If life is a battlefield, 
And there's so many dangers
Just when you think its okay, 
It blows up in your face
And when this road gets harder
You think your lucks ran out
I will find a reserve 
Jay and Max:
To take it right back
To where your heart deserves
'Cause there is no way that I won't put you first
All:
I'll be your hero whose standing strong
Who protects you from any fights
And if your battles are piling on
I will take them on with all my might
Cry your tears on my shoulder
You don't know what the future holds
So I'll be your personal soldier
Siva:
I'll protect you, Girl don't worry
All:
I'll be your hero whose standing strong
Who protects you from any fight
And if your battles are piling on
I will take them on with all my might
Cry your tears on my shoulder
You don't know what the future holds
So I'll be your personal soldier
Left, left, left, right, left
Left, left, left, right, left.
