<song artist="The_Wanted" title="Behind_Bars">
Tom:
I feel something over me
And try to run away from the demons that haunted me
Max:
The key turns inside
No place to hide
I'm locked in no place,
Jay:
No place
All:
I think I could be going crazy, going crazy oh oh
Feeling the walls come closer, bodies colder oh
'Cause I'm behind bars
'Cause I'm behind bars
Tom:
Now a whisper's calling me
And why does my skin crawl
With the pain of insanity?
Max:
The key turns inside
No place to hide
I'm locked in no place, no place
All:
I think I could be going crazy, going crazy oh oh
Feeling the walls come closer, bodies colder oh
'Cause I'm behind bars
'Cause I'm behind bars
Nathan:
Let me out of here
I need somebody please
All:
I think I could be going crazy, going crazy oh oh
Feeling the walls come closer bodies colder oh
'Cause I'm behind bars
'Cause I'm behind bars
Nathan:
Behind bars
