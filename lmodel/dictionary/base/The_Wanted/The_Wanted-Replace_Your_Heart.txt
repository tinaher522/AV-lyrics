<song artist="The_Wanted" title="Replace_Your_Heart">
Tom:
You know I never want to hurt you
Don't know why I'd ever want to, oh oh oh
There's no comfort in another face
Are you gonna let it go to waste?
Oh oh oh
Max:
I keep on trying
But how can I find it
When they don't compare to you
No oh
All:
I'm running out of patience
Tired of imitations
Looking for someone to
Replace your heart
Everyone I talk to
Is just another not you
Makes me wonder 
How we're so far apart
I'm tired of imitations 
Running out of patience 
Tryin' to replace
Replace your heart
Tom and Jay:
Must be crazy if I let you go
You were everything I need to know
Come back home
Tom:
Feels like I'm dying 
'Cause I keep on finding 
Tom and Max:
Every junction leads to here 
And I'm lost
All:
I'm running out of patience 
Tired of imitations
Looking for someone to
Replace your heart
Everyone I talk to
Is just another not you
Makes me wonder 
How we're so far apart
I'm tired of imitations 
Running out of patience 
Tryin' to replace
Replace your heart
Max and Siva:
Everywhere I turn
Is the wrong direction
Everyone I see is the wrong reflection
Reminding me that I just
Can't replace your heart
All:
I'm running out of patience 
Tired of imitations 
Looking for someone to
Replace your heart
Everyone I talk to 
Is just another not you 
Makes me wonder 
How we're so far apart
I'm tired of imitations 
Running out of patience 
Tryin' to replace
Replace your heart
Nathan:
I've been through the crowds 
Called your name out loud 
But there's still no way to replace you
Nathan and Tom:
I've looked everywhere 
Everywhere everywhere 
To replace your heart
Max:
To replace your heart
