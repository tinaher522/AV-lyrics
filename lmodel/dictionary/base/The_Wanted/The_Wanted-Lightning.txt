<song artist="The_Wanted" title="Lightning">
Tom:
You're in control
Pressing pause on my heartbeat
Someone stole all the air
So I can't speak now
I know the chase is on
I feel as though
My time has come
Jay:
How many times do I fly
Through your head space?
Now we're speeding away
From a safe place
Yeah your skin
Your touch the kiss
The rush too much
And here it comes
All:
When your lips touch mine
It's the kiss of life
I know, 
I know that it's a little bit frightening
We might as well be playing
With lightning
We touch like
Like it's our first time, oh oh
I know that it's a little bit frightening
We might as well be playing
With lightning now
Oh oh
Oh oh
Siva:
Just you and me and the
Goats in the back room
Learning things they don't
Teach in classroom
Now, your here
And feel the fear
But everything is all so clear
Nathan:
I've been addicted to you
Since it first hit
Out of control like a surge of electric
Yeah, your skin
Your touch the kiss
The rush too much
And here it comes
All:
When your lips touch mine
It's the kiss of life
I know, 
I know, that it's a little bit frightening
We might aswell be playing
With lightning
We touch like
Like it's our first time , oh oh
I know it's a little bit frightening
We might as well be playing
With lightning now
Oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh
Nathan:
Your skin, your touch
The kiss, too much
Tom:
Your skin, your touch
To kiss, the rush
Jay:
Your skin, your touch
To kiss, too much
Max:
The rush, the rush
The rush, the rush
All:
When your lips touch mine
It's the kiss of life
I know, 
I know, that it's a little bit frightening
We might aswell be playing with lightning
We touch like,
Like it's our first time oh oh
I know it's a little bit frightening
We might as well be playing
With lightning now
Oh oh
Oh oh
