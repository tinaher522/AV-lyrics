<song artist="The_Wanted" title="Let's_Get_Ugly">
Max:
Now this melody’s a healer 
It’s got my baby in a fever 
And I hope it gets the better of you 
With this Morricone music 
There’s no way you can refute it 
But girl you ain’t got nothing to lose
Tom:
Aye aye aye girl oh oh oh 
It’s not who you know 
When I’m what you know 
Aye aye aye
Just come and go with me 
Aye aye aye, girl gone gone gone 
Don’t want a room full of snakes 
If the lights are on and 
Aye aye aye 
Just come and go with me
All:
Will the angel or the devil,
Die in ecstasy?
There’s something coming over you 
Come over me 
Falling in love is never easy 
'Cause they’re so good
I’m so bad, so let’s get ugly
Max:
Now she’s a gentle mental 
Got perversions detrimental 
But there’s times 
I just don’t know what to do. 
She’s all grown up and sexy 
And I know she’s not my baby 
But man, I ain’t got nothing to lose
Tom:
Aye aye aye girl oh oh oh 
It’s not who you know 
When I’m what you know 
Aye aye aye
Just come and go with me 
Aye aye aye, girl gone gone gone 
Don’t want a room full of snakes 
If the lights are on and 
Aye aye aye, 
Just come and go with me
All:
Will the angel or the devil,
Die in ecstasy?
There’s something coming over you 
Come over me 
Falling in love is never easy 
‘Cause they’re so good 
I’m so bad, so let’s get ugly
Jay:
It’s never easy 
The good the bad 
The good the bad 
Good bad Good Bad 
Let’s get ugly
All:
Will the angel or the devil 
Die in ecstasy?
There’s something coming over you 
Come over me 
Falling in love is never easy 
‘Cause they’re so good 
I’m so bad, so let’s get ugly
