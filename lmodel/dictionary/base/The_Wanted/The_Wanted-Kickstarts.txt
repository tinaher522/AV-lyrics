<song artist="The_Wanted" title="Kickstarts">
You want me to come over I got an excuse
Might be holding your hand but I'm holding it loose
Go to talk then we choke its like our necks in a noose
Avoid the obvious we should be facing the truth
Start to think it could be fizzling out
Kinda shocked because I never really had any doubts
Look into your eyes imagine life with out ya'
And the love kick starts again
Starts again
And The Love kick starts again
Starts again
Its the same old you the same old me
You get bored and I get cold feet
Get high get wondering eyes
Forget I've never ever had it so sweet
I realize what I got when I'm out of town
Cos deep down you're my girl in a golden crown
My princess and I don't wanna let you down
No I don't wanna let you down no no no
You want me to come over I got an excuse
Might be holding your hand but I'm holding it loose
Go to talk then we choke its like our necks in a noose
Avoid the obvious we should be facing the truth
Start to think it could be fizzling out
Kinda shocked because I never really had any doubts
Look into your eyes imagine life with out ya'
Kick-Kickstarts again
Start to think it could be fizzling out
Kinda shocked because I never really had any doubts
Look into your eyes imagine life with out ya'
And the love kick starts again
Starts again
And the love kick starts again
Starts again
And the love kick starts again
Start to think it could be fizzling out (Starts again)
Jay, Nathan &amp; Siva:
Kinda shocked because I never really had any doubts (Starts again)
Look into your eyes imagine life with out ya'
Love kickstarts again 
Start to think it could be fizzling out (Starts again)
Kinda shocked because I never really had any doubts (Starts again)
Look into your eyes imagine life with out ya'
And the love kick starts again.
