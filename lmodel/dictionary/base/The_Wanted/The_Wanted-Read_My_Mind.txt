Nathan:
It's like you lock me down, yeah
Just take a look around, yeah
It's like a fire burning
Burning up inside
How do I find the words to
To find the words to show you?
Only you can call me out
Out into the crowd
Tom:
I bet if you could read my mind
You would go and do it all the time
Tell me where do we go from here?
I need to know, I need to know now
I bet if you could get in my head
And see everything I never said
Tell me where do we go from here?
I need to know, I need to know now
Jay:
You're on the other side, yeah
You're just across the line, yeah
And I can feel you reaching
Reaching out for me
How do I find the words to
To finds the words to show you?
Only you can call me out
Out into the crowd, yeah
All:
I bet if you could read my mind
You would go and do it all the time
Tell me where do we go from here?
I need to know, I need to know now
I bet if you could get in my head
And see everything I never said
Tell me where do we go from here?
I need to know, I need to know now
Nathan:
Yeah
All:
I bet if you could read my mind
You would go and do it all the time
Tell me where do we go from here?
I need to know, I need to know now
I bet if you could get in my head
And see everything I never said
Tell me where do we go from here?
I need to know, I need to know now
I need to know, I need to know now
I need to know, I need to know now
