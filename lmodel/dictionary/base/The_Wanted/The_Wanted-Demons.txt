Nathan:
Hey, I see a secret in your face
Did someone steal you away?
Is there someone else in my place?
I don't like this game
I, I can see the dirt on your hands
'Cause I know the way that you dance
Don't cover up cause it shows
I wish you would
Siva:
Stop right now what you doing, I know
I got a needle in my brain and an ache in my bones
I cannot do a damn thing 'cause nobody's home
And it's hell, oh yeah, now I say
All:
All my life I'm playing like a winner
But all I see looking back in the mirror
Demons in my head
The demons in my head, oh oh
All this time the saint was a sinner
The joke's on me a stone cold killer
Demons in my head
The demons in my head
Tom:
You have a natural sway
And you know how sweet you taste
But I can't take your flame
Like a bullet through my veins
Jay:
As you scratch beneath my skin
My resistance's crumbling
I cover up but it shows
But I guess you know again
Max:
Stop right now what you doing, I know
I got a needle in my brain and an ache in my bones
I cannot do a damn thing 'cause nobody's home
And it's hell, oh yeah, now I say
All:
All my life I'm playing like a winner
But all I see looking back in the mirror
Demons in my head
The demons in my head, oh oh
All this time the saint was a sinner
The joke's on me, a stone cold killer
Demons in my head
The demons in my head
Nathan:
All this time, I said all this time
All this time
Max:
All this time
Nathan:
All this time, I said all this time
All this time
Max: 
All this time
All:
All my life I'm playing like a winner
But all I see looking back in the mirror
Demons in my head
The demons in my head, oh oh
All this time the saint was a sinner
The joke's on me, a stone cold killer
Demons in my head
The demons in my head
All my life I'm playing like a winner
But all I see looking back in the mirror
Demons in my head
The demons in my head, oh oh
All this time the saint was a sinner
The joke's on me a stone cold killer
Demons in my head
The demons in my head
