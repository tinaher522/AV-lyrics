Jay:
Words travel fast,
So you spend all your time in your head,
What’s the point in that?
'Cause words never last,
What you say now is not what you said.
And I’m okay with that.
Tom:
You’re keeping yourself tied up,
So you won’t let me down
Didn't you ever think, just maybe
All:
I’ll understand you
Just give me the chance to
Love you more than you’ll ever know
Even if it means I gotta let you go…
With or without me,
Baby you should be happy
If you’re heading down another road
Don’t you leave me with nowhere to go
Max:
Don’t let me be the last to know, yeah
Don’t let me be the last to know
Nathan:
You take all I have,
Still I pour you a half-empty glass,
What’s the point in that?
And all I ever ask
Is that you tell me when it's is not enough,
'Cause if it’s real love
All:
I’ll understand you
Just give me the chance to
Love you more than you’ll ever know
Even if it means I gotta let you go…
With or without me,
Baby you should be happy
If you’re heading down another road
Don’t you leave me with nowhere to go
Max:
Don’t let me be the last to know
Nathan:
And maybe you’ll find what you really wanted
'Cause what you left behind and all your dreams are haunted
Maybe I’ll move on, or maybe I’ll just stay
Either way…
Jay:
I hope you’ll understand me
If I say we can’t be
So if you wanna go
I want you to know
All:
I’ll understand you
Just give me the chance to
Love you more than you’ll ever know
Even if it means I gotta let you go…
With or without me,
Baby you should be happy
If you’re heading down another road
Don’t you leave me with nowhere to go
Max:
Don’t let me be the last to know, yeah
Don’t let me be the last to know
Don’t let me be the last to know
