<song artist="The_Wanted" title="Weakness">
Max:
She aims a smile with the safety off
And she's not afraid to use it
She holds my gaze just long enough
For me to feel like I'm gonna lose it
Tom:
And I know that she knows
That I know what she's doing to me
And she knows when she calls
I'll fall for her every time
'Cause I'm wrapped I'm wrapped around 
Your perfect little finger
And I'm trapped inside the cell
Of every sound she makes
All:
She is my weakness
She is my weakness
Jay:
A look from her is like oxygen
How would I keep breathing  without her
She breaks a whole as she looks away 
Now my heart ain't beating without her
Nathan:
And I know that she knows
That I know what she's doing to me
And she knows when she goes 
I'll come for her every time
Max:
'Cause I'm wrapped I'm wrapped around 
Your perfect little finger
And I'm trapped inside the cell
Of every sound she makes
All:
She is my weakness
She is my weakness
Jay:
I know it might sound crazy 
But I don't wanna let go
Now I don't mind spending every night if you don't let go
I know it might sound crazy 
But I don't wanna let go
Now I don't mind spending every night if you don't let go
All:
'Cause I'm wrapped I'm wrapped around 
Your perfect little finger
And I'm trapped inside the cell
Of every sound she makes
She is my weakness
She is my weakness
