Nathan:
Baby come over here
I just gotta tell you something, something
There’s nothing left to fear
There’s nothing that can hurt you, nothing
We could take on the bodies of angels 
Away from everyone 
Touch as we circle the world 
You and me, on the run
Max:
So put your hands up to the sky
Yeah put ‘em up
Follow me, if you wanna fly 
I’ll show you love
Put your hands up to the sky, inside of mine 
When we touch, we get so high
All:
Like a satellite
Max:
I don’t wanna come down, I just want your love now
All:
Like a satellite
Max:
I don’t wanna come down, I just want your love
All:
Baby hold on tight
Tom:
Look at the stars above
We’re the only thing that’s brighter, brighter
Tonight you can feel the love
The way I feel around you, lighter
Nathan:
We could take on the bodies of angels
Away from everyone
Touch as we circle the world
You and me, on the run
Max:
So put your hands up to the sky
Yeah put ‘em up
Follow me, if you wanna fly
I’ll show you love
Put your hands up to the sky, inside of mine
When we touch, we get so high
All:
Like a satellite
Max:
I don’t wanna come down, I just want your love now
All:
Like a satellite
Max:
I don’t wanna come down, I just want your love
All:
Baby hold on tight
Tom:
The way I feel around you, lighter
The way I feel around you
Max:
Baby hold on tight
Baby hold on tight
All:
Like a satellite
Max:
I don’t wanna come down, I just want your love now
All:
Like a satellite
Max:
I don’t wanna come down, I just want your love
All:
Baby hold on tight
Max:
I don’t wanna come down, I just want your love now
All:
Like a satellite
Max:
I don’t wanna come down, I just want your love
All:
Baby hold on tight
