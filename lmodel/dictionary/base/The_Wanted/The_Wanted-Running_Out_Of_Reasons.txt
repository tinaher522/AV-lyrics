<song artist="The_Wanted" title="Running_Out_Of_Reasons">
All:
Oh, you're running out of reasons
Nathan:
Shut it out, what you heard about
What you heard about me
They say I'm rough or loud, but they
Don't know nothing, not a thing about me
Max:
So tear up that list of things
You wrote down, wrote down
Why you can never be
With me now, not now
Nathan:
I know where you wanna be
Tom:
You wanna say
No, no, it ain't gonna work
But then you fumble your words
All:
Oh, you're running out of reasons
Nathan:
No, no, tell all of your lies
You'll bite your lips on mine
All:
Oh, you're running out of reasons
Max:
Just let the fire burn, burn, girl
Some things you cannot learn, learn so
Tom:
Oh, oh, let it all go
There's stuff you already know that
Oh, you're running out of reasons
Max:
Stand right there, you'll never get nowhere
When you run like you do, like you do
It's no, no fair, I'm sure that you're secret's out
Everyone sees right through you
Jay:
So tear up that list of things
You wrote down, wrote down
Why you can never be
With me now, not now
Max:
I know where you wanna be, yeah
Tom:
You wanna say
No, no, it ain't gonna work
But then you fumble your words
All:
Oh, you're running out of reasons
Nathan:
No, no, tell all of your lies
You'll bite your lips on mine
All:
Oh, you're running out of reasons
Max:
Just let the fire burn, burn, girl
Some things you cannot learn, learn so
Tom:
Oh, oh, let it all go
There's stuff you already know that
Oh, you're running out of reasons
Jay:
Never was, never was a bad time to
Nathan:
Love somebody, so love me baby, yeah
Siva:
Never was, never was a better
Feeling than just saying yeah, yeah
Nathan:
Woah, oh
Tom:
You wanna say
No, no, it ain't gonna work
But then you fumble your words
All:
Oh, you're running out of reasons
Nathan:
No, no, tell all of your lies
You'll bite your lips on mine
All:
Oh, you're running out of reasons
Max:
Just let the fire burn, burn, girl
Some things you cannot learn, learn so
Tom:
Oh, oh, let it all go
There's stuff you already know that
Oh, you're running out of reasons
