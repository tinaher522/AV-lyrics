Nathan:
You think you've seen me
You haven't seen nothing
I'm looking for something more than this
I'm feeling no limits
I'm seizing each minute
Don't wanna,
Don't wanna just exist
Don't want my feet on the ground
Wanna feel the speed of sound
I want it now
I want to fly
Like a rocket to the sky
Going up a million miles
And I'm not coming down
Won't stop 'til I feel the sky at my feet
My dreams are my wings
I'm flying
Flying high
Tom:
I'm climbing, I'm rising
I'm striking like lightning
Write my name in skywriting
For all to see
I'll do something epic
And they won't forget it
Good enough's not good enough for me
Max:
I want the ride of my life
Want to reach the speed of light
Want it tonight
I want to fly
Like a rocket to the sky
Going up a million miles
And I'm not coming down
Won't stop 'til I feel the sky at my feet
My dreams are my wings
I'm flying
Flying high
Jay:
Never gonna make my way down
I'll make the galaxy my playground
Siva:
It's gonna be one hell of a ride
I'll fly
Nathan:
Like a rocket to the sky
Going up a million miles
And I'm not coming down
Won't stop 'til I feel the sky at my feet
My dreams are my wings
I'm flying
Flying high
