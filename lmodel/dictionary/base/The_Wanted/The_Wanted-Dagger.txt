Siva:
Stay, won't beg you to stay
Go, yeah, I'll be okay
Won't kill me this way, oh, oh
At least that's what I'll say
Nathan:
No, you don't have to know
The wounds that hurt me the most
'Cause I'll never show
Just how deep they go
Max:
That's why I'm telling you
All:
Everytime you have to go
I don't think you even know
It's like a dagger in my heart
Everytime you have to leave
Can't believe it cuts so deep
It's like a dagger in my heart
Dagger Dagger
Dagger, dagger
Dagger, dagger
It's like a dagger in my heart
Dagger Dagger,
Dagger dagger
Dagger dagger
Max:
It's like a dagger in my heart
Siva:
Strong, I thought I was strong
These scars will heal before long
I guess I was wrong, oh, Oh
And I'm too far gone
Nathan:
Try, I know I should try
To just get on with my life
But it's slipping away tonight
There's some loves you can't survive
Max:
That's why I'm telling you
All:
Everytime you have to go
I don't think you even know
It's like a dagger in my heart
Everytime you have to leave
Can't believe it cuts so deep
It's like a dagger in my heart
Dagger Dagger
Dagger dagger
Dagger dagger
It's like a dagger in my heart
Dagger Dagger
Dagger dagger
Dagger dagger
Max:
It's like a dagger in my heart
Siva:
The last words I would say
Nathan:
Is there ain't anyone else
Siva:
Can take this pain away
Nathan:
That's why I'm telling you!
All:
Everytime you have to go
I don't think you even know
It's like a dagger in my heart
Everytime you have to leave
Can't believe it cuts so deep
It's like a dagger in my heart
Dagger Dagger
Dagger dagger
Dagger dagger
It's like a dagger in my heart
Dagger Dagger
Dagger dagger
Dagger dagger
Max:
It's like a dagger in my heart
Tom:
Everytime you have to go
I don't think you even know
It's like a dagger in my heart
Everytime you have to leave
Can't believe it cuts so deep
It's like a dagger in my heart
