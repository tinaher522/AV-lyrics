<song artist="The_Wanted" title="Fight_For_This_Love">
Too much of anything can make you sick
Even the good can be a curse 
Makes it hard to know which road to go down
Knowing too much can get you hurt.
Is it better? Is it worse?
Are we sitting in reverse
It's just like we're going backwards. 
I know where I want this to go
Driving fast but let's go slow
What I don't wanna do is crash nooo.
Just know you're not in this thing alone
There's always a place in me that you can call home
Whenever you feel like we're growing apart
Let's just go back, back, back, back, back to the start.oh
Anything that's worth having
Is sure enough worth fighting for
Quitting's out of the question
When it gets tough, gotta fight some more.
We gotta fight, fight, fight, fight, fight for this love
We gotta fight, fight, fight, fight, fight for this love
We gotta fight, fight, fight, fight, fight for this love
If it's' worth having, it's worth fighting for oh-oh-oh
Now everyday ain't gon' be no picnic
Love aint a walk in the park
All you can do is make the best of it now
Can't be afraid of the dark.
We gotta fight, fight, fight, fight, fight for this love
We gotta fight, fight, fight, fight, fight for this love
We gotta fight, fight, fight, fight, fight for this love
If it's worth having, it's worth fighting for 
I don't know where I'm heading,ohh
I'm willing and ready to go.
We've been driving so fast
We just need to slow down
And just ro-o-o-o-o-oll.
Anything that's worth having
Is sure enough worth fighting for
Quitting's out of the question
When it gets tough, gotta fight some more.
We gotta fight, fight, fight, fight, fight for this love
We gotta fight, fight, fight, fight, fight for this love
We gotta fight, fight, fight, fight, fight for this love
If it's worth having, it's worth fighting for oh-oh-oh
We gotta fight, fight, fight, fight, fight for this love
We gotta fight, fight, fight, fight, fight for this love
We gotta fight, fight, fight, fight, fight for this love
It's worth having, it's worth fighting for oh-oh-oh-oh-oh...
