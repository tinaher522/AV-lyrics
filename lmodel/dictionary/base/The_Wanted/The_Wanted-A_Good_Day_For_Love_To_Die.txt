<song artist="The_Wanted" title="A_Good_Day_For_Love_To_Die">
Jay:
Seen the change, watching it fade
Holding my breath feeling it fail
Working hard wondering why
Can't fix it now, so why even try?
All:
We've run out of time
It's over, I'm over this life, I'm running dry
I'm out of here, out of your life
It's a good day for resurrection
It's a good time to break the connection
To the heart that I've been neglecting
It's a good day for love for love to die
Tom:
Not easy to say harder to do
But that's no kinda life, so I'll leave it to you
Working it hard wondering why
Can't fix it now, so why even try?
All:
We've run out of time
It's over I'm over this life, I'm running dry
I'm out of here out of your life
It's a good day for resurrection
It's a good time to break the connection
To the heart that I've been neglecting
It's a good day for love for love to die
Tom and Jay:
There's not a chance, there's not a prayer
Can't pull a miracle out of the air
So now I'm leaving,
Letting it lie, letting it die
All:
We've run out of time
It's over I'm over this life, I'm running dry
I'm out of here out of your life
It's a good day for resurrection
It's a good time to break the connection
To the heart that I've been neglecting
It's a good day for love, for love to die
Nathan:
For love to die, 
All:
For love to die
For love to die, 
For love to die
Max:
It's a good day for love for love to die, for love to die
