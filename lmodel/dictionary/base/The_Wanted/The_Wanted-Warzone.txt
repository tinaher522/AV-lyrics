<song artist="The_Wanted" title="Warzone">
Nathan:
I can't believe I had to see
The girl of my dreams cheating on me
The pain you caused has left me dead inside
I'm gonna make sure you regret that night
I feel you close, I feel you breathe
And now it's like you're here
You're haunting me
You're out of line
You're out of sight
You're the reason that we started this fight
All:
But I know I just gotta let it go
I should'a known
I gotta learn to say goodbye now
I throw my armour down
And leave the battleground
For the final time now
I know I'm running from a warzone
Jay:
In our house, I hate that place
Everywhere I walk I see your face
Try to erase a memory with a flame
And hope I'll never see you again
Standing here in this burning room
You know the end could never come so soon
Nathan:
It's clear to me the lies you used
The ones that kill me ain't hurting you
All:
So I know I just gotta let it go
I should'a known
I gotta learn to say goodbye now
I throw my armour down
And leave the battleground
For the final time now
I know I'm running from a warzone
Max:
I'm running from a warzone
I can't do this anymore
I'm running from a warzone
What are we fighting for?
I'm running from a warzone
All:
I know I just gotta let it go
I should'a known
I gotta learn to say goodbye now
I throw my armour down
And leave the battleground
For the final time now
I know I'm running from a warzone
