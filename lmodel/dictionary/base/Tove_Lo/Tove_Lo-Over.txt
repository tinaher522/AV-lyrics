<song artist="Tove_Lo" title="Over">
Stay up until dawn, I can't go home again now
After tonight seems like I'm out of your life
Apologize? No, it won't make it better
What can I say? It's all too late
Tell me, is this the part when, when we part ways forever?
Tell me, is this the part when, part when we are o-o-o-over?
Wish I was, wish I was so-so-so-sober
Guess we are, guess we are
Fighting out of fight, you're so cold without the love
There is nothing left out of everything we were
O-o-o-over, guess we are over
Walk through the door, you see that I've been crying
Head hanging low, you say "where the fuck have you been?"
Should I deny and maybe dodge this bullet?
You read my mind, I just can't lie
Tell me, is this the part when, when we part ways forever?
Tell me, is this the part when, part when we are o-o-o-over?
Wish I was, wish I was so-so-so-sober
Guess we are, guess we are
Fighting out of fight, you're so cold without the love
There is nothing left out of everything we were
O-o-o-over, guess we are over
O-o-o-o-over, o-o-o-o-over, o-o-o-o-over
Over, guess we are over
I can tell that you know when it kills you
What you need me to say's gonna hurt you
Wanna run but I stay 'cause I have to, have to tell you
And I know that you're so gonna hate me
You did what I did, I would hate you too, I would hate you too
And we are, over, over
Wish I was, wish I was so-so-so-sober
Guess we are, guess we are
Fighting out of fight, you're so cold without the love
There is nothing left out of everything we were
O-o-o-over, guess we are over
O-o-o-o-over, o-o-o-o-over, guess we are over
O-o-o-o-over, o-o-o-o-over
