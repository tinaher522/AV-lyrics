<song artist="Tove_Lo" title="My_Gun">
Heads turn, your body burn, rip off your clothes for me
Make out, lash out, keep dancing, naked, feeling free
That's my gun, that's my gun
That's my gun, mmmm-hhmm
Last night you were who you prefer because of me
Wake up messed up but you're still happy as can be
That's my gun, that's my gun
That's my gun, mmmm-hhmm
Do you think I'm easy, oooooh
Boy if you're gonna shoot me down
Do it gently
I'm not easy ooooh
But go ahead and touch me now
Do it gently
You're fine, you're mine, I'm the mistake you wanna make
Hey ho, let's go, it's one more chance you gotta take
That's my gun, that's my gun
That's my gun, mmmm-hhmm
I'm ace in space and oh I know you want to fly
My tune your moon jump on my cloud and we go high
That's my gun, that's my gun
That's my gun, mmmm-hhmm
Do you think I'm easy, oooooh
Boy if you're gonna shoot me down
Do it gently
I'm not easy ooooh
But go ahead and touch me now
Do it gently
Do it gently, gently, gently
Gently, gently, gently
That's 
My
Gun
Do you think I'm easy, oooooh
Boy if you're gonna shoot me down
Do it gently
I'm not easy ooooh
But go ahead and touch me now
Do it gently
Do it gently, gently, gently
Do it gently, do it gently, gently
