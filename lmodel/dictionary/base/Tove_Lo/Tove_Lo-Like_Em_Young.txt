<song artist="Tove_Lo" title="Like_Em_Young">
Hey boy, you're too young for me but I
Don't care 'cause you're all I see
I like em young
I, I like em young
Eyes wide oh you're so na√Øve, thinking
No one knows better than me
I like em young
I, I like em young
And people make me wonder
Age is just a number
That they don't think about
That's all I think about
I like  em young, I like em young, I like em young
Young like me with a mind so easy
I like  em young, I like em young, I like em young
Young like me with a mind so easy
I like em...
Hey girl, why you judging me when your
Your guy's turning 53
I like em young
I, I like em young
Nah, I don't know what really gets you more, is it
That my guy's gonna live out yours
I like em young
I, I like em young
They say they don't care but I
I can tell they're lying
Cause we're all slowly dying
Trying to work it out
And all I think about
I like em young, I like em young, I like em young
Young like me with a mind so easy
I like em young, I like em young, I like em young
Young like me with a mind so easy
I like em...
Life! I live mine
Love! Not one kind
All is fair in love and war
My manners out the door
What do I need them for?
I like em young, I like em young, I like em young
Young like me with a mind so easy
I like em young, I like em young, I like em young
Young like me with a mind so easy
I like em young
