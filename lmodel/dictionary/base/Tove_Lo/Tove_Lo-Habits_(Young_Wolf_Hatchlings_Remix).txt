<song artist="Tove_Lo" title="Habits_(Young_Wolf_Hatchlings_Remix)">
Staying in my play pretend where the fun ain't got no end 
Can't go home alone again need someone to numb the pain 
Staying in my play pretend where the fun ain't got no end 
Can't go home alone again need someone to numb the pain
Got to stay 
High, all the time, to keep you off my mind 
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh 
High, all the time, to keep you off my mind 
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Staying in my play pretend where the fun ain't got no end 
Can't go home alone again need someone to numb the pain
You're gone and I got to stay 
High, all the time, to keep you off my mind 
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh 
High, all the time, to keep you off my mind 
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Staying in my play pretend where the fun ain't got no end 
Can't go home alone again need someone to numb the pain 
Staying in my play pretend where the fun ain't got no end 
Can't go home alone again need someone to numb the pain
Got to stay 
High, all the time, to keep you off my mind 
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh 
High, all the time, to keep you off my mind 
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Staying in my play pretend where the fun ain't got no end 
Can't go home alone again need someone to numb the pain
You're gone and I got to stay
Got to stay
