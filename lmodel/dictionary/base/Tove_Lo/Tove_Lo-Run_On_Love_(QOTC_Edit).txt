<song artist="Tove_Lo" title="Run_On_Love_(QOTC_Edit)">
(We can run on love for a while
We can run on love for a while)
I had one mission
But I committed treason
Can't believe I caved for you
So I am now a failure
Everything I gave ya
Let's elope and live like you
Trapped inside each other
We don't even bother
Naive say it's a beautiful thing
Hope we live forever
Doesn't sound too clever
Works as my protective wing
We can run on love for a while
We can run on love for a while
We can run on love til it dies
Til it dies again
We can run on love for a while
We can run on love for a while
We can run on love til it dies
Til it dies again 
Together we fall
I had one mission
But I committed treason
Promised I would stay away
From you and your bad tricks
You were my quick fix
I can feel it fade away
Suddenly the day came
We started to place blame
Driving us right out of our heads
You say it's my error
I say look in the mirror
The reason why our flame is dead
We can run on love for a while
We can run on love for a while
We can run on love til it dies
Til it dies again
We can run on love for a while
We can run on love for a while
We can run on love for a while
Til it dies
I always go back to you
I always go back
I always go back to you
I always go back
I always go back to you
I always go back
I always go back to you
Together we fall
