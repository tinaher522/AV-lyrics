<song artist="Tove_Lo" title="Out_Of_Mind">
Lovers into friends, move on to strangers
Let go, no more us, move on, I'm trying
Denying, saying "time will heal"
Keep lying to make me feel
I'm okay, so you believe I'll forget you, seriously?
Really? Are you kidding me?
You're out of your, you're out of your
You're out of your mind to think that I
You're out of your, you're out of your
You're out of your mind to think that I
To think that I could keep you out of mind
Happy, used to be, together, you and me
Things die, drift apart, wait for a new start
Denying, think you'll fade away
Keep lying, I can hear you say
'You're in touch with reality', baby, I'd say
Are you kidding me?
You're out of your, you're out of your
You're out of your mind to think that I
You're out of your, you're out of your
You're out of your mind to think that I
To think that I could keep you out of mind
How can you say I'll be alright?
What makes you think that I'll be fine?
Baby, you have to be completely out of your
You're out of your mind
To think that I could keep you out of mind
You're out of your, you're out of your
You're out of your mind to think that I
You're out of your, you're out of your
You're out of your mind to think that I
To think that I could keep you out of mind
You're out of your mind
You're out of your mind
You're out of your mind to think that I
To think that I, to think that I
To think that I could keep you out of mind
