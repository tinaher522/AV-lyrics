<song artist="Tove_Lo" title="Got_Love">
When I breathe then I breathe into you and I feel it right to the bone
And I give what you give and we go even higher than we are strong
And the cracks in the walls covered up by the sheets we live underneath
All the sex, all the nights we stay up, yeah, we're stuck but we're more than free
Ooooh aaah oooooh aaaaah 
Got the world in our hand like a land
Got enough to make the ocean look like it's a pond
Got enough to turn the valleys into mountain-tops
And we live like legends now know that we'll never die
We got love we got love
Got enough to make the ocean look like it's a pond
Got enough to turn the valleys into mountain-tops
And we live like legends now know that we'll never die
We got love we got love
I can feel that you feel what I feel and I feel it all in your hands
When we touch it's too much and you're making me move yeah now make me dance
Going body to body for good saying nobody gets it right
We don't plan we don't care got the fume and the flame we don't let it die
Ooooh aaah oooooh aaaaah 
Got the world in our hand like a land
Got enough to make the ocean look like it's a pond
Got enough to turn the valleys into mountain-tops
And we live like legends now know that we'll never die
We got love we got love
Got enough to make the ocean look like it's a pond
Got enough to turn the valleys into mountain-tops
And we live like legends now know that we'll never die
We got love we got love
Perfect like a picture I know we are one and the same
Perfect like a picture even when they look through the grains
Got enough to make the ocean look like it's a pond
Got enough to turn the valleys into mountain-tops
And we live like legends now know that we'll never die
We got love we got love
Got enough to make the ocean look like it's a pond
Got enough to turn the valleys into mountain-tops
And we live like legends now know that we'll never die
We got love we got love
We got love we got love
We got love we got love
