<song artist="Imagine_Dragons" title="Tokyo">
Baby's got a lot of baggage
It don't seem to matter, it don't seem to matter
Bough a ticket to the mid-west, just for business
But dismissed it from the interest
It was a risk just for a mistress who was a hostess on the west-coast
Don't you see it in my eyes tonight-iiii-iiiight
Baby's got a lot of baggage
Where do I have to go,
To find a honey with a little soul?
Tokyo, Tokyo - Turn off the lights and let it go
Oh it's nice to meet you 
Kimi Tanoshimu
Tokyo, Tokyo - Pay in the palms of the rock'n'roll
Get that dynamite
Chicka-Boom on the down tonight
I never seem to get it right
But you can show me so politely
Now don't you see it in my eyes tonight-iiii-iiiight
Get that dynamite
Where do I have to go,
To find a honey with a little soul?
Tokyo, Tokyo - Turn off the lights and let it go
Oh it's nice to meet you 
Kimi Tanoshimu
Tokyo, Tokyo - Pay in the palms of the rock'n'roll
Hey! I come back to where you are
Hey! I come back to where you are
Get that Dynamite
Where do I have to go,
To find a honey with a little soul?
Tokyo, Tokyo - Turn off the lights and let it go
Oh it's nice to meet you 
Kimi Tanoshimu
Tokyo, Tokyo - Pay in the palms of the rock'n'roll
Where do I have to go,
To find a honey with a little soul?
Tokyo, Tokyo - Turn off the lights and let it go
Oh it's nice to meet you 
Kimi Tanoshimu
Tokyo, Tokyo - Pay in the palms of the rock'n'roll
Hey! I come back to where you are 
Hey! I come back to where you are
Tokyo
Tokyo
Tokyo!
