<song artist="Imagine_Dragons" title="Rocks">
Where do we go from here?
I threw some rocks up at your window
I broke some rocks right through your window
Timber timber, we're falling down
Let the forest hear us out
Bumba rumba rum awh awh
Bumba rumba rum awh awh
Why can't I see what's right in front of me
We fall, we falling
We fall, we falling
We fall, we falling
We fall, we falling
