<song artist="Imagine_Dragons" title="I_Bet_My_Life">
I know I took the path that you would never want for me
I know I let you down, didn't I?
So many sleepless nights where you were waiting up on me
Well, I'm just a slave unto the night
Now remember when I told you that's the last you'll see of me?
Remember when I broke you down to tears? (Oh yeah)
I know I took the path that you would never want for me
I gave you hell through all the years
So I, I bet my life
I bet my life
I bet my life on you, ooh, ooh
I, I bet my life, I bet my life
I bet my life on you, ooh, ooh
I've been around the world and never in my wildest dreams
Would I come running home to you
I've told a million lies but now I tell a single truth
There's you in everything I do (Oh, oh yeah)
Now remember when I told you that's the last you'll see of me?
Remember when I broke you down to tears? (Whoa whoa ooh)
I know I took the path that you would never want for me
I gave you hell through all the years
So I, I bet my life
I bet my life
I bet my life on you, ooh, ooh
I, I bet my life, I bet my life
I bet my life on you, ooh, ooh
Don't tell me that I'm wrong
I've walked that road before and left you on your own
And please believe them when they say
That it's left for yesterday and the records that I play
Please forgive me for all I've done
So I, I bet my life
I bet my life
I bet my life on you, ooh, ooh
I, I bet my life, I bet my life
I bet my life on you, ooh, ooh
(Yeah, yeah) I, I bet my
I bet my (Oh yeah, yeah, ooh)
I bet my
I, I bet my life
I bet my life
I bet my
