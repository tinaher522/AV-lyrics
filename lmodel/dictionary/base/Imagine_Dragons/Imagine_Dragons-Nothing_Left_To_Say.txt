<song artist="Imagine_Dragons" title="Nothing_Left_To_Say">
Who knows how long I've been awake now?
The shadows on my wall don't sleep
They keep calling me, beckoning
Who knows what's right; the lines keep getting thinner
My age has never made me wise
But I keep pushing on and on and on and on
There's nothing left to say now
There's nothing left to say now
I'm giving up, giving up, hey hey, giving up now
I'm giving up, giving up, hey hey, giving up now
Below my soul, I feel an engine
Collapsing as it sees the pain
If I could only shut it out
I've come too far to see the end now
Even if my way is wrong
I keep pushing on and on and on and on
There's nothing left to say now
There's nothing left to say now
I'm giving up, giving up, hey hey, giving up now
I'm giving up, giving up, hey hey, giving up now
I keep falling, I keep falling down
I keep falling, I keep falling down
I keep falling, I keep falling down
I keep falling, I keep falling down
If you could only save me
I'm drowning in the waters of my soul
There's nothing left to say now
There's nothing left to say now
I'm giving up, giving up, hey hey, giving up now
I'm giving up, giving up, hey hey, giving up now
