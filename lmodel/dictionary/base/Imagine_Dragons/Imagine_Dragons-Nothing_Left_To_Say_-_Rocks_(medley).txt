[Nothing Left to Say]
[Verse 1]
Who knows how long I've been awake now?
The shadows on my wall don’t sleep
They keep calling me, beckoning
Who knows what’s right? The lines keep getting thinner
My age has never made me wise
But I keep pushing on and on and on and on
[Chorus x2]
There’s nothing left to say now, oh, oh
There’s nothing left to say now, oh, oh
I’m giving up, giving up, hey, hey, giving up now
I’m giving up, giving up, hey, hey, giving up now
[Verse 2]
Below my soul, I feel an engine
Collapsing as it sees the pain
If I could only shut it down
I’ve come too far to see the end now
Even if my way is wrong
But I keep pushing on and on and on and on
[Chorus x2]
[Bridge]
I keep falling, I keep falling down
I keep falling, I keep falling down
I keep falling, I keep falling down
I keep falling, I keep falling down
If you could only save me
I’m drowning in the waters of my soul
[Chorus x2]
[Rocks]
Where do we go from here?
I threw some rocks up at your window
I broke some rocks right through your window
Timber timber, we’re falling down
Let the forest hear us out
Boom, badoom badoom, oh oh
Boom, badoom badoom, oh oh
Why can’t I see what’s right in front of me
We fall, we fall apart
We fall, we fall apart
We fall, we fall apart
We fall, we fall apart
