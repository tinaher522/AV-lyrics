<song artist="Imagine_Dragons" title="Amsterdam">
I'm sorry, mother... I'm sorry, I let you down.
Well, these days I'm fine - No these days I tend to lie.
I'll take the West train, just by the side of Amsterdam,
Just by my left brain, just by the side of the tin-man.
I'm sorry, brother... I'm sorry, I let you down.
Well, these days you're fine - No these days you tend to lie.
You'll take the West train, just by the side of Amsterdam,
Just by your left brain, just by the side of the tin-man.
Your time will come if you wait for it, if you wait for it,
It's hard, believe me... I've tried.
But I keep coming up short.
I'm sorry lover, I'm sorry I bring you down.
Well, these days I've tried and these days I tend to lie.
Kinda thought I was a mystery and then I thought it wasn't meant to be,
You said yourself fantastically, "Congratulations you were all alone".
Your time will come if you wait for it, if you wait for it,
It's hard, believe me... I've tried.
Your time will come if you wait for it, if you wait for it,
It's hard, believe me... I've tried.
But the rain won't fall for the both of us,
And sun won't shine on the both of us.
Believe me when I say, that I wouldn't have it any other way.
Your time will come if you wait for it, if you wait for it,
It's hard, believe me... I've tried.
But I won't wait much longer, cause these wall start crashing down.
Oh I won't wait much longer, cause these wall start crashing down.
And I keep coming up shore...
