<song artist="Imagine_Dragons" title="The_Fall">
Maybe I'm broken, maybe I'm wrong
I could've spoken sooner than I should've
Only the good die old
That's what they told me, but I don't know
Maybe I'm breaking up with myself
Maybe I'm thinking I should just keep to
The things that I've been told
Wait for the colors to turn to gold
Do you know?
Do you know?
(You're all I know, you're all I know)
Everything keeps crashing down
(You're all I know, you're all I know)
I'm ready for the fall
I'm ready for everything
That I believed in to drift away
I'm ready for the leaves
Ready for the colors to burn to gold and crumble away
Maybe I'm destined to be distraught
Always a reason, breaking me down to my
Knees in the dead of night
I keep on praying to see the light
Maybe I'm breaking up with myself
Maybe I'm thinking I should just keep to
The things that I've been told
Wait for the colors to turn to gold
Do you know?
Do you know?
(You're all I know, you're all I know)
Everything keeps crashing down
(You're all I know, you're all I know)
Do you know?
Do you know?
(You're all I know, you're all I know)
Everything keeps crashing down
(You're all I know, you're all I know)
I'm ready for the fall
I'm ready for everything
That I believed in to drift away
I'm ready for the leaves
Ready for the colors to burn to gold and crumble away
You were the one, you were the one
You were the one who helped me see
You were the one, you were the one
Oh, you gave it all to me
You were the one, you were the one
You were the one who helped me see
You were the one, you were the one
Oh, you gave it all to me
You were the one, you were the one
You were the one who helped me see
You were the one, you were the one
Oh, you gave it all to me
You were the one, you were the one
You were the one who helped me see
You were the one, you were the one
Oh, you gave it all to me
You were the one, you were the one
You were the one who helped me see
You were the one, you were the one
Oh, you gave it all to me
You were the one, you were the one
You were the one who helped me see
You were the one, you were the one
Oh, you gave it all to me
I'm ready for the fall
I'm ready for the leaves
Ready for the colors to burn to gold and crumble away
