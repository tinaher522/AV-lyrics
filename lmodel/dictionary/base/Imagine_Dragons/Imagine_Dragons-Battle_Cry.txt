<song artist="Imagine_Dragons" title="Battle_Cry">
Just one more time before I go
I'll let you know
That all this time I've been afraid
Wouldn't let it show
Nobody can save me now, no
Nobody can save me now
Stars are only visible in darkness
Fear is ever-changing and evolving
And I, I feel poisoned inside
And I, I feel so alive
Nobody can save you now, the king is crowned, it's do or die
Nobody can save you now, the only sound
Is the battle cry, is the battle cry, is the battle cry
Nobody can save you now, it's do or die
Nobody can save you now, the king is crowned, it's do or die
Nobody can save you now, the only sound
Is the battle cry, is the battle cry, is the battle cry
Nobody can save you now, it's do or die
Just one more time before I go
I'll let you know
That all this time I've been afraid
Wouldn't let it show
Nobody can save me now, no
Nobody can save me now
