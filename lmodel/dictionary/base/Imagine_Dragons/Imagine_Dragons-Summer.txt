<song artist="Imagine_Dragons" title="Summer">
If only for a second
Let me have you
Tell me all your secrets
Let me know you
Paint me all your pictures
Hang them on my wall 
Show me all your colors 
Show me all
Open up your eyes
Open up your mind
Fall in love with what you mean to me
Open up your eyes
Open up your mind
Fall in love with what you mean to me
A fire burns into you purifying all
But what I saw was opulence 
And that's not for me
That's not for me
No, that's not for me
Only in summertime 
Only in summertime 
Things will change with time 
But only in summertime
Open up your eyes
Open up your mind
Fall in love with what you mean to me
Open up your eyes
Open up your mind
Fall in love with what you mean to me
Only in summertime
Only in summertime
Things will change with time 
But only in summertime
