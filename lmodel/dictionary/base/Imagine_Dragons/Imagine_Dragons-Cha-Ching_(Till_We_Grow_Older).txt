<song artist="Imagine_Dragons" title="Cha-Ching_(Till_We_Grow_Older)">
I don't sleep so well at night
Waiting up and shivering
Heater's gone and money's tight
In this little room I'm living in
You gotta live your life 
While your blood is boiling
Cause doors won't open 
While you stand and watch them
Oh, oh, oh, what is with you? 
Oh, oh, oh, I've never seen this side of you 
Oh, oh, oh, what is with you? 
Oh, oh, oh, I've never seen this side of you
We're all living til we grow older
You be the worker, I'll be the soldier
I never hear those sounds you sing to me
Cha-ching, cha-ching, cha-ching-a-ling
I never hear those sounds you sing to me
Cha-ching, cha-ching, cha-ching-a-aling
I don't think it's quite the same
Just running out to feel the rain
Staring as the stars parade
Are they telling me it's gonna be okay? 
You gotta live your life 
While your blood is boiling
Cause doors won't open 
While you stand and watch them
Oh, oh, oh, what is with you? 
Oh, oh, oh, I've never seen this side of you 
We're all living til we grow older
You be the worker, I'll be the soldier
I never hear those sounds you sing to me
Cha-ching, cha-ching, cha-ching-a-ling
I never hear those sounds you sing to me
Cha-ching, cha-ching, cha-ching-a-aling
Go on and be brave
Go on and be brave
Go on and be brave
Go on be brave
We're all living til we grow older
You be the worker, I'll be the soldier
I never hear those sounds you sing to me
Cha-ching, cha-ching, cha-ching-a-ling
I never hear those sounds you sing to me
Cha-ching, cha-ching, cha-ching-a-aling
We're all living til we grow older
You be the worker, I'll be the soldier
I never hear those sounds you sing to me
Cha-ching, cha-ching, cha-ching-a-ling
I never hear those sounds you sing to me
Cha-ching, cha-ching, cha-ching-a-aling
Older, when we're older, till we're older
Till we're older, till we're older, till we're older
Older, till we're older, till we're older...
