<song artist="Selena_Gomez" title="Whiplash">
A baby moonlight,
Hits the spotlight.
I'm on my flight,
To take you away.
I'm feeling so free,
You're making me crazy,
That's what you do,
That's what you do,
Let's go now.
Lickety split,
A girl in a bit as she falls in a pit.
Saying hello darling.
Twisted insanity,
Fallen humanity,
All I want is some tranquility.
Do you hear me? Do you hear me?
Well come on, boy.
A come on,
And take me to the other side.
I'm blown away,
When I look into your eyes.
I'm so in love,
I think I'm gonna crash.
And get whiplash whiplash whiplash!
It's up to you,
And I don't wanna give you clues.
We're moving fast,
I think we got enough to lose
So don't look back,
Or else we're gonna crash.
And get whiplash! whiplash! whiplash!
Like a first kiss,
With a sweet list.
Of some love songs,
Oh yeah.
And with this melody,
Falling over me.
It makes me weak,
So damn weak.
So let's go now.
Lickety split,
A girl in a bit as she falls in a pit.
Saying hello darling.
Twisted insanity,
Fallen humanity,
All I want is some tranquility.
Do you hear me? Do you hear me?
Well come on, boy.
A come on,
And take me to the other side.
I'm blown away,
When I look into your eyes.
I'm so in love,
I think I'm gonna crash.
And get whiplash! whiplash! whiplash!
It's up to you,
And I don't wanna give you clues.
We're moving fast,
I think we got enough to lose
So don't look back,
Or else we're gonna crash.
And get whiplash! whiplash! whiplash.
La la la la la la la,
La la la la la la la,
La la la Oh yeah,
La la la la la la la,
La la la la la la la,
So let's go now...
A come on,
And take me to the other side.
I'm blown away,
When I look into your eyes.
I'm so in love,
I think I'm gonna crash.
And get whiplash! whiplash! whiplash!
It's up to you,
And I don't wanna give you clues.
We're moving fast,
I think we got enough to lose
So don't look back,
Or else we're gonna crash.
And get whiplash! whiplash! whiplash!
