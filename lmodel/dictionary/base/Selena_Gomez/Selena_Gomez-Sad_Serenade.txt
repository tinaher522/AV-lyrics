<song artist="Selena_Gomez" title="Sad_Serenade">
Happier times flashed through my mind
We both say it's over
And I believe it this time
All the pain that I hide
Let it play through the night
A sad sad serenade
Sad sad seranade
We almost got it right
A sad sad serenade
Sad seranade
For every broken heart tonight
All the love that we made
Turn it up, let it play
A sad sad serenade
Sad serenade
I won't regret
What I won't forget
Memories and your number
Are all I have left
I wish you the best, I really do
Even though I know that I'm still not over you
I know that we both are to blame
I can't believe you didn't fight harder for me
Is a sad sad serenade
Sad serenade
We almost got it right
A sad sad serenade
Sad serenade
For every broken heart tonight
All the love that we made
Turn it up, let it play
A sad sad serenade
Sad serenade
The more you love
The more it hurts
When it ends
When it's over
All that's left are the memories
Playing over and over
In your head
In your heart
Turn it up
Make it stop
Tonight all over the world
The most beautiful song ever heard
Is a sad sad serenade
Sad serenade
We almost got it right
A sad sad serenade
Sad serenade
For every broken heart tonight
All the love that we made
Turn it up, let it play
A sad sad serenade
Sad serenade
A sad sad serenade
Sad serenade
