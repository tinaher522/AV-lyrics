<song artist="Selena_Gomez" title="One_And_The_Same">
Hey, hey, hey!(la, la, la, la, la, la) 
Hey, hey, hey!(la, la, la, la, la, la) 
You come from here, I come from there 
You rock out in your room, I rock the world premiere 
We're more alike than anybody could ever tell (ever tell) 
Friday we're cool, Monday we're freaks 
Sometimes we rule, sometimes we can't even speak
But we can get out, let loose, and LOL (LOL) 
It may seems cliché for me to wanna say 
That you're not alone 
And you can call me uncool 
But it's a simple fact 
I've got you back 
Yeah, yeah, yeah 
Cuz we're one and the same 
We're anything but ordinary 
One and the same 
I think we're almost legendary 
You and me, the perfect team 
Chasing down the dream 
We're one and the same! 
Hey! Hey! Hey! 
I'm kind of like you 
You're kind of like me 
We're in the same song 
And a different key 
It's got a rhythm that you and can get along (get along) 
It may seems cliché for me to wanna say 
For me to wanna say 
That you're not alone 
And you can call me uncool 
But it's a simple fact 
I still got you back 
Yeah, yeah, yeah 
Cuz we're one and the same 
We're anything but ordinary 
One and the same 
I think we're almost legendary 
You and me, the perfect team 
Shaking up the scene 
We're one and the same! 
Hey! Hey! Hey! 
Cuz we're one and the same
We're anything but ordinary
One and the same
We're so good momen-momentary
Cuz we're one
Yeah, yeah
Cuz we're one
Yeah, yeah
We're anything but ordinary
You and me, the perfect team
Chasing down the dream
You and me, the perfect team
Shaking up the scene
One and the same
Hey! Hey!!(la,la,la,la,la,la) 
Hey,hey,hey!
