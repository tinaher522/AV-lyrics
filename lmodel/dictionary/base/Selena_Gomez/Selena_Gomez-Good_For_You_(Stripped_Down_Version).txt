<song artist="Selena_Gomez" title="Good_For_You_(Stripped_Down_Version)">
I'm in my 14 carats, I'm 14 carat
Doing it up like Midas, mmm
Now you say I got a touch, so good, so good
Make you never wanna leave, so don't, so don't
Gonna wear that dress you like, skin-tight
Do my hair up real, real nice
And syncopate my skin to your heart beating
Cause I just wanna look good for you, good for you, uh-huh
I just wanna look good for you, good for you, uh-huh
Let me show you how proud I am to be yours
Leave this dress a mess on the floor
And still look good for you, good for you, uh-huh
I'm on my Marquise diamonds, I'm a Marquise diamond
Could even make that Tiffany jealous, mmm
You say I give it to you hard, so bad, so bad
Make you never wanna leave, I won't, I won't
Gonna wear that dress you like, skin-tight
Do my hair up real, real nice
And syncopate my skin to how you're breathing
Cause I just wanna look good for you, good for you, uh-huh
I just wanna look good for you, good for you, uh-huh
Let me show you how proud I am to be yours
Leave this dress a mess on the floor
And still look good for you, good for you, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh
Trust me, I can take you there
Trust me, I can take you there
Trust me, I, trust me, I, trust me, I
I just wanna look good for you, good for you, uh-huh
Baby, let me be good to you, good to you, uh-huh
Let me show you how proud I am to be yours
Leave this dress a mess on the floor
And still look good for you, good for you, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh
Uh-huh, uh-huh
Trust me, I, trust me, I, trust me, I
