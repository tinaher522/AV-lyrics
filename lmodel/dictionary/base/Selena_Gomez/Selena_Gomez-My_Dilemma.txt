<song artist="Selena_Gomez" title="My_Dilemma">
You make me so upset sometimes
I feel like I could lose my mind,
The conversation goes nowhere
Because you're never gonna take me there
And I know, what I know
And I know you're no good for me
Yeah I know, what I know
And I know it's not meant to be
Here's my dilemma
One half of me wants ya
And the other half wants to forget
My-my-my dilemma
From the moment I met ya
I just can't get you out of my head
And I tell myself to run from you
But I find myself attracted to my dilemma,
My dilemma, it's you, it's you
Your eyes have told a thousand lies
But I believe them when they look in mine,
I heard the rumors but you won't come clean
I guess I'm hoping it's because of me
And I know, what I know
And I know you're no good for me
Yeah I know, what I know
And I know it's not meant to be
Here's my dilemma
One half of me wants ya
And the other half wants to forget
My-my-my dilemma
From the moment I met ya
I just can't get you out of my head
And I tell myself to run from you
But I find myself attracted to my dilemma,
My dilemma, it's you, it's you
Woah, I could live without you
Your smile, your eyes
The way you make me feel inside
I could live without you
But I don't wanna
I don't wanna
Oh
Oh, you make me so upset sometimes
Here's my dilemma
One half of me wants ya
And the other half wants to forget
My-my-my dilemma
From the moment I met ya
I just can't get you out of my head
(Can't get you out of my)
And I tell myself to run from you
But I find myself attracted to my dilemma,
My dilemma, it's you, it's you
(It's you, it's you)
It's you, it's you, it's you, it's you (it's you)
It's you, it's you, it's you
My-My-My Dilemma
