<song artist="Selena_Gomez" title="Hot_And_Cold">
You change your mind
Like a girl changes clothes
Yeah you, PMS like a bitch
I would know
And you over think
Always speak cryptically
I should know
That you're no good for me
'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up
(You)
You don't really want to stay, no
(But you)
But you don't really want to go
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down
We used to be just like twins
So in sync, the same energy
Now's a dead battery
Used to laugh bout nothing
Now you're plain boring
I should know that
You're not gonna change
'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up
(You)
You don't really want to stay, no
(But you)
But you don't really want to go
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down
Someone call the doctor
Got a case of a love bipolar
Stuck on a roller coaster
Can't get off this ride
You change your mind
Like a girl changes clothes
'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up
(You)
You don't really want to stay, no
(But you)
But you don't really want to go
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down, down
