<song artist="Bring_Me_The_Horizon" title="Sleep_With_One_Eye_Open">
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts,
Everything i gave to you, everything that we've been through,
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches,
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years,
the ink scarred on your back, may as as well have disappeared,
for as long as i remember you sold everything you owned,
but now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own,
Sleep with one eye open
(because)
Sleep with one eye open...cunt!
If I had it my way I'd slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back,
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me,
I'm inside of you (x4)
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate,
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at your feet,
You've got hell to pay, yeah you've got hell to pay,
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy,
get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever ... cunt!
