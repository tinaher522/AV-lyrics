<song artist="Bring_Me_The_Horizon" title="Football_Season_Is_Over">
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
arm out like a Nazi - every cunt's driving past
where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone. I can't see anything!
the hardest part of today is a hangover
empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
and it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night. I can't remember anything!
I can't remember last night. I can't remember anything!
Turn this fuckin' shit up
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead.
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead.
Dance all fuckin' night
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead.
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead.
Dance all fuckin' night
We are done with giving a fuck
