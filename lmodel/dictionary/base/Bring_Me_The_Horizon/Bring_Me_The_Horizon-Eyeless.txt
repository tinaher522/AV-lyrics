Insane - AM I THE ONLY MOTHER FUCKER WITH A BRAIN?
I'm hearing voices but all they do is complain,
How many times have you wanted to kill,
Everything and everyone - Say you'll do it but never will!
You can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes,
Can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes,
You can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes!
I am my Father's son,
Cuz he's a phantom, a mystery and that leaves me
Nothing!
How many times have you wanted to die?
It's too late for me, all you have to do is get rid of me!
You can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes,
Can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes,
You can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes!
It's all in your head!
It's all in my head!
It's all in your head!
Yeah!
I tried - You lied to me for so long,
Everywhere I go, there's a sense of it.
Freak on my antics and give me a choice,
Doesn't matter if I give a shit,
It's shit that you gave me.
You can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes,
Can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes,
You can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes!
It's all in your head!
It's all in my head!
It's all in your head!
Do you wanna feel pain?
Taking my name in vain; caring never felt so lame inside.
Anybody else got pride? Do you wanna take my life?
Maybe I'll reverse my ride.
Who the fuck are you? FUCK YOU!
Better suck it up cause you bled through,
Better get away from me.
Stay the fuck away from me!
I feel safe - seems you're saved.
I feel safe, it, seems you're saved!
Look me in my brand new eye x3
Mother Fucker!
Look me in my brand new eye x3
Look me in my brand new.
