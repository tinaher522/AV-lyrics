<song artist="Bring_Me_The_Horizon" title="Chelsea_Smile">
I've got a secret.
It's on the tip of my tongue.
It's on the back of my lungs.
And I'm gonna keep it.
I know something you don't know.
It sits in silence.
Eats away at me.
It feeds like cancer.
This guilt could fill a fucking sea.
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door.
Now falling and failing is all I know.
This disease is getting worse.
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse.
The only thing I really know... I can't sleep at night.
I am buried and breathing in regret, yeaaaah!
The only thing I really know... I can't sleep at night.
I am buried and breathing in regret.
I've got a secret.
It's on the tip of my tongue.
It's on the back of my lungs.
And I'm gonna keep it.
I know something you don't know.
I've got a secret.
It's on the tip of my tongue.
It's on the back of my lungs.
And I'm gonna keep it.
I know something you don't know.
Oh.
I may look happy, but honestly dear,
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear.
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed.
They lick their lips, as all the shame spills out of me.
Repent, repent! The end is nigh!
Repent, repent! We're all going to die!
Repent, repent! These secrets will kill us!
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent! The end is nigh!
Repent, repent! We're all going to die!
Repent, repent! These secrets will kill us!
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness!
We all carry these things,
Inside that no one else can see.
They hold us down like anchors.
They drown us out at sea.
I look up to the sky.
There may be nothing there to see.
But if I don't believe in him,
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret.
It's on the tip of my tongue.
It's on the back of my lungs.
And I'm gonna keep it.
I know something you don't know.
I've got a secret.
It's on the tip of my tongue.
It's on the back of my lungs.
And I'm gonna keep it.
I know something you will never know.
I know something you don't know.
