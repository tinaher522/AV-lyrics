<song artist="Bring_Me_The_Horizon" title="Oh_No">
You don't have to lie
I know exactly where you've been
'Cause you're chewin' off my ear
While you're chewin' on your chin
No, we're not on the level, you're just off your face
It's not a state of mind, no, your head's just in a state
I may be on the outside but you're empty within
It's getting kind of old now, I think it's time to pack it in
Don't call it a party 'cause it never stops
Now one is too many but it's never enough
Don't tell me you're happy 'cause this isn't love
So be careful what you wish for
So be careful what you wish for
Who you're trying to fool?
You know you're in over your head
'Cause you're holdin' onto heaven
But you're hangin' by a thread
And we're not on the level, you're just off your face
It's not a state of mind, no, your head's just in a state
I may be on the outside but you're empty within
It's getting kind of old now, I think it's time to pack it in
Don't call it a party 'cause it never stops
Now one is too many but it's never enough
Don't tell me you're happy 'cause this isn't love
So be careful what you wish for
So be careful what you wish for
(Oh no)
Don't call it a party 'cause it never stops
Now one is too many but it's never enough
Don't tell me you're happy 'cause this isn't love
So be careful what you wish for
Don't call it a party 'cause it never stops
Now one is too many but it's never enough
Don't tell me you're happy 'cause this isn't love
So be careful what you wish for
Don't call it a party 'cause it never stops
Now one is too many but it's never enough
Don't tell me you're happy 'cause this isn't love
So be careful what you wish for
