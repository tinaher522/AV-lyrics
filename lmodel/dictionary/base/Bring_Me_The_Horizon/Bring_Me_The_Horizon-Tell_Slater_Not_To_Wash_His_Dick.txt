<song artist="Bring_Me_The_Horizon" title="Tell_Slater_Not_To_Wash_His_Dick">
I've been away for every day and every fucking night
I've seen your eyes, i've seen your eyes
I've been away for every day and every fucking night
And with every city, it gets harder
You got a mouth like a razor blade. It cuts so deep
So kiss my wrists my neck and give me eternal sleep
You say, you say, I'm only a phone call away
But for me, this distance is decay
You say, you say, I'm only a phone call away
But for me, this distance is decay
So line my throat with lipstick and leave my blood for flies
I'll gurgle the blues under a sea of lies
Before you take me to the sea, let me kiss the bride
Before you take me to the, let me kiss the bride
Now take my body to the shore and ill wait for the tide
I will always love you
But I need pills to sleep
I have always failed you
So throw away my memories
Move!
I will always love you
But I need pills to sleep
I have always failed you
So throw away my memories
Throw them all away
So throw away my memories
Throw them all away
