<song artist="Bring_Me_The_Horizon" title="Shed_Light">
Show me how to kill you.
You shed light then she'll get all broken.
Hurry up and get home my dear, where the fuck you been?
Can't you take a purpose with the shape of a better sin?
You
The clones come back on the bright of day.
The clones come back on the bright of day.
The clones come back on the bright of day.
The clones come back.
The clones come back.
The clones come back on the bright of day.
The clones come back on the bright of day.
The clones come back.
Put on your best dress,
The words you awaited.
Put on your best fucking dress,
The words you awaited.
Why can't you just...
You're better leagued, and let's fuck away your parting.
To drag your gravestone.
To drag your gravestone.
Just leave it all fucking alone.
I shall kill your murdered soul.
I will dance on your grave.
I will dance on your grave.
