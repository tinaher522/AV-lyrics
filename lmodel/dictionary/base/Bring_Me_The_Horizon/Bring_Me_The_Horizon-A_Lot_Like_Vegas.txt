<song artist="Bring_Me_The_Horizon" title="A_Lot_Like_Vegas">
So cash in all your chips tonight baby, cuz were going out of style.
we could leave this city, if only for a while.
well take this feeling to our graves
for every heart that we betrayed.
no one can know about this.
the only place ill ever call home, is my deathbed.
i know were so wrong, but it feels so right.
and its not a party, if it happens every night.
im running on empty, your running out of luck.
so lets ditch this city, before we sober up
