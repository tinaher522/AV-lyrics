<song artist="Bring_Me_The_Horizon" title="Liquor_&_Love_Lost">
I thought I saw your eyes,
Laced in smoke &amp; cigarette curls.
I thought I saw your eyes
But I'm seeing ghosts tonight.
She haunts me!
'til my bitter end.
She haunts me!
I swear I heard your voice, overwhelmed by conversation.
I swear I heard your voice but I'm hearing ghosts tonight!
The bars turn out there lights.
And I drink away the day as it decays.
So much for living forever,
So much for death do us part
She haunts me!
She haunts me!
She haunts me!
Every fucking...
NIGHT!
