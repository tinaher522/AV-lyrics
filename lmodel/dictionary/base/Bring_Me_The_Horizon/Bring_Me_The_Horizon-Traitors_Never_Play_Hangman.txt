<song artist="Bring_Me_The_Horizon" title="Traitors_Never_Play_Hangman">
This is what the edge of your seat was made for, 
Holding on, on your own, 
This is what the edge of your seat was made for, 
And this, 
This is what the back of your hand was made for, 
Stolen apologies, 
Stolen apologies, 
You, 
You're a traitor to my heart, 
You're a traitor to us all, 
Forsaken, 
Forsaken, 
We're all movie stars, 
We're all movie stars, 
We're all movie stars, 
We're all movie stars, 
And I'm speaking these words, 
And I'm talking to the mirror, 
You're a traitor to my heart, 
You're a traitor to us fucking all, 
I don't want to kiss anyone, 
I don't want to kiss anyone but you, 
I fucking love you
