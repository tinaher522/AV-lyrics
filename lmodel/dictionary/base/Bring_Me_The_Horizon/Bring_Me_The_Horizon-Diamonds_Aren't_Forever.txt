We will never sleep
'Cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest
Till we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep
'Cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest
Till we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep
'Cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest
Till we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep
'Cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest
Till we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep
'Cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest
Till we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep
'Cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest
Till we're all fucking dead
I refuse, I refuse, I refuse
To close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for far too long
I have loved, and I have lost
I've gave into this for far too long
So close your eyes not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive, then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive, then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive, then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive, then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for far too long
I have loved, and I have lost
I've gave into this for far too long
So close your eyes not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep
'Cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest
Till we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep
'Cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest
Till we're all fucking dead
I refuse, I refuse, I refuse to close my eyes
