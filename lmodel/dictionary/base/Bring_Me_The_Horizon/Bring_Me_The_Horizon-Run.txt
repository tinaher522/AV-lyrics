<song artist="Bring_Me_The_Horizon" title="Run">
My heart's a hieroglyph, it talks in tongues
Ten thousand voices fill my broken lungs
But through the white wave I still hear it call
So take a deep breath, let's disappear
No one will listen so why are we still here?
And in the black hole you will see it all
'Cause this is not enough
And I won't wait for them to cut me up
So give me all you've got
They'll never stop until they see us fall
So let's run
So let's run
Your hand's a hurricane, it moves in waves
A perfect storm that keeps you wide awake
But through the silence you will feel it burn
So take my hand and let's run away
You know there's nothing here to make us stay
And in the darkness you will see the sun
'Cause this is not enough
And I won't wait for them to cut me up
So give me all you've got
They'll never stop until they see us fall
So let's run away 'cause everything's broken
And we're so much more than another brick in the grave
So give me your every, give me your everything
And let's get away 'cause everything's broken
I know that we're more than another brick in the grave
So give me your every, give me your everything
(This is not enough)
('Cause this is not enough)
'Cause this is not enough
And I won't wait for them to cut me up
So give me all you've got
They'll never stop until they see us fall
So let's run
'Cause this is not enough
And I won't wait for them to cut me up
So give me all you've got
They'll never stop until they see us fall
So let's run
So let's run
So let's run
