<song artist="Bring_Me_The_Horizon" title="Rawwwrr!">
Yeah,
Rawwwrr,
Taking back,
What you stole from me,
Taking back,
What you stole from me baby,
Taking back,
What you stole from me,
Taking back,
What you stole from me baby,
Taking back,
What you stole...
Taking back,
What you stole from me baby,
Wash away these memories, silent and proud,
Wash away these memories, silent and proud,
Those wounds cut me,
Blind rage cutters,
Your applause, my hands,
Your applause, my fucking hands,
Run for the hills,
Your strength, from the dead afar,
Run for the hills,
Your strength from luck, cut this off,
And if you think you're alive,
Then you're better off fucking dead,
This will be over mind and body,
This will be over mind and body,
This will be over mind and body,
This will be over mind and body,
This will be over mind and body,
This will be over mind and body
