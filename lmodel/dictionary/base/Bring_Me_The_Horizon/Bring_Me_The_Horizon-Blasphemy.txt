<song artist="Bring_Me_The_Horizon" title="Blasphemy">
You got hell to pay but you already sold your soul
It's blasphemy but the words don't make sense no more
What would your mother say? Your faith has you immured
So don't try and tell me that you still believe
No, don't preach to me
Ask no questions and you'll get no lies
Turn the cheek and blind the eye, let it go
Bend the knee and give away your life
Bite your tongue and close your mind, never know
'Cause you got hell to pay but you already sold your soul
It's blasphemy but the words don't make sense no more
What would your mother say? Your faith has you immured
So don't try and tell me that you still believe
No, don't preach to me
You're not blessed, you're cursed
And it's getting worse now
It makes no sense but it must be right
The blood and sweat you sacrificed
Was it all for nothing?
'Cause we've found no sign and we've seen no light
We hear no voice when we pray at night
But we swore and now it's too late to turn back
You're not blessed, you're cursed
And it's getting worse now
You got hell to pay but you already sold your soul
It's blasphemy but the words don't make sense no more
What would your mother say? Your faith has you immured
So don't try and tell me that you still believe
No, don't preach to me
No, don't preach to me
Don't preach to me (You're not blessed you're cursed)
No, don't preach to me (And it's getting worse now)
It's blasphemy
