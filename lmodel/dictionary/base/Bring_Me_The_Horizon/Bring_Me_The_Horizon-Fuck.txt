<song artist="Bring_Me_The_Horizon" title="Fuck">
Let's fuck until the sun comes up.
Because we haven't got long, but we've got enough
A night to remember, a day to forget
Don't stop until we pirouette
I'm no saint, you're no martyr
One more night playing heart pinata
How do you say goodbye?
How do you say goodbye when you've hardly said hello?
The only way we know, the only way we know.
The only way we know, the only way we know.
How do you say goodbye when you've hardly said hello?
Let's fuck!
Fuck!
Fuck, fuck, fuck!
Let's fuck until our hearts give up.
It won't be long.
A day to remember, a night to forget
If our eyes were diamonds we'd be rich.
Your voice makes my heart skip beats.
So, keep quiet before it quits on me.
Your voice makes my heart skip beats.
So, keep quiet before it flat lines.
Before it flat lines.
I'm dead
Tell them all we're dead
We can hold the wake right here in this bed
Sunk into you; tangled in sheets.
Buried in blankets six foot deep

Fuck, fuck, fuck!
Let's fuck until the sun comes up.
Because we haven't got long, but we've got enough
A night to remember, a day to forget
Don't stop until we pirouette
I'm no saint, you're no martyr
One more night playing heart pinata
How do you say goodbye?

How do you say goodbye when you've hardly said hello?
How do you say goodbye when you've hardly said hello?
We're young and in love, heart attacks waiting to happen.
So come a little closer, tell me it's all in our heads.
We're young and in love, heart attacks waiting to happen.
So come a little closer, tell me those three little words.
We're young and in love, heart attacks waiting to happen.
So come a little closer, tell me it's all in our heads.
We're young and in love, heart attacks waiting to happen.
So come a little closer, tell me those three little words.
We're young and in love, heart attacks waiting to happen.
(We're young and in love, heart attacks waiting to happen!)
So come a little closer, tell me it's all in our heads.
(So come a little closer, tell me it's all in our heads!)
We're young and in love, heart attacks waiting to happen.
(We're young and in love, heart attacks waiting to happen!)
So come a little closer, tell me those three little words.
(So come a little closer, tell me those three little words!)
