Oli
Don't look down
(Let's go)
You'll never take me, you'll never win
If I'm going down, you're coming with me
I'll never shut down, I'll never sleep
If I'm going down, I'll take the world with me
Orifice Vulgatron
Yo, the Devil's at your door
You sold your soul, now he's coming back for more
No fighting it, it will only make it worse
You signed the line, you said the words
Get ready for the end of everything (Don't look down)
Get ready for the end of everything (Don't look down)
Yo, the Devil's at your door (The Devil's at your door)
You sold your soul, now he's coming back for more
Both
Don't fight it, it will only make it worse
You signed the line, you said the words
Get ready for the end of everything
Get ready for the end of everything
Oli
What have you done? You've opened it now
And I'm not sure there's anyway round
Why do you run? It's tripping me out
And I don't know if I can keep up with you now
The sky is falling, the sun is burning; a hallway to our eyes
The ground will open like an ocean and swallow us alive
You say you swear to God, now swear to me
You say you swear to God, now swear to me
Orifice Vulgatron
Yo, the Devil's at your door
You sold your soul, now he's coming back for more
Both
Don't fight it, it will only make it worse
You signed the line, you said the words
Get ready for the end of everything (You'll never take me, youâ€™ll never win!)
Get ready for the end of everything
Oli
If I'm going down, I'll take the world with me
What have you done? You've opened it now
And I'm not sure there's anyway round
Why do you run? It's tripping me out
And I don't know if I can keep up with you now
The sky is falling, the sun is burning; a hallway to our eyes
The ground will open like an ocean and swallow us alive
You say you swear to God, now swear to me
You say you swear to God, now swear to me
The sky is falling, the sun is burning; a hallway to our eyes
The ground will open like an ocean and swallow us alive
You say you swear to God, now swear to me
You say you swear to God, now swear to me
Now swear to me, now swear to me
