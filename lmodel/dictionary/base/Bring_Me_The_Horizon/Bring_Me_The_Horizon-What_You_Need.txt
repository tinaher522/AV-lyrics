<song artist="Bring_Me_The_Horizon" title="What_You_Need">
You're hypnotized, can't see the signs
I'd like to help you but I think it's too late
Made up your mind and now you're blind
I guess it's easier than making mistakes
Don't ask me why then roll your eyes at the answer
You want to fight but I won't bite on the bait
And I'm not trying to change your eyes so don't panic
'Cause I'm not selling
So don't tell me what I can't see
'Cause we both know it's you, not me
You don't want this but it's what you need
And you'll see it when you believe
You'll see it, you'll see it
You'll see it when you believe
You'll see it, you'll see it
And you'll see it when you believe
Give me a break 'cause I can't take
Another second, you're a fuckin' headache
I ain't got time to change your mind
How can I move you when you're stuck in your ways
Don't ask me why then roll your eyes at the answer
You want to fight but I won't bite on the bait
And I'm not trying to change your eyes so don't panic
I'm just saying, no, I'm just saying
Don't come crawling back to me when you break down
'Cause you dug yourself into this hole all by yourself
Don't come crawling back to me when you break down
You can find somebody else
So don't tell me what I can't see
'Cause we both know it's you, not me
You don't want this but it's what you need
And you'll see it when you believe
Don't tell me what I can't see
'Cause we both know it's you, not me
You don't want this but it's what you need
And you'll see it when you believe
You'll see it, you'll see it
You'll see it when you believe
You'll see it, you'll see it
And you'll see it when you believe
Yeah, hell yeah
You make me wanna slit my wrists and play in my own blood
Yeah, hell yeah
You make me wanna kill myself just for the fuckin' fun, alright
Yeah, hell yeah
You make me wanna slit my wrists and play in my own blood
Yeah, hell yeah
You make me wanna kill myself just for the fuckin' fun
So don't tell me what I can't see
'Cause we both know it's you, not me
You don't want this but it's what you need
And you'll see it when you believe
And you'll see it when you believe
