<song artist="Bring_Me_The_Horizon" title="It_Was_Written_In_Blood">
Goodbye my friend, goodbye 
My love, you're in my heart 
It was preordained that we should part 
We're united by and by, united by and by 
Goodbye 
No handshake to endure, there was nothing 
It was written in blood 
It was written in blood 
It was written in blood 
Oh god, written in blood 
It was written in blood 
It was written in blood 
Oh my god, it was written in blood 
Inside no sadness, furrowed brow
As nothing new lay dying now 
Inside no sadness, furrowed brow 
And nothing new lay dying now 
And it was written in blood 
It was written in blood 
It was written in blood 
It was written in blood 
Oh my god, it was written in blood 
It was written in blood 
It was written in blood 
Oh my god! 
It was written... in blood 
On a suicide note 
Like roses, we blossom and die 
Like roses, we blossom and die 
Like roses, we blossom and die 
We fall apart (Die) 
We fall apart (Die) 
Like roses, we blossom and die 
Like roses, we blossom and die 
We fall apart 
We fall apart 
Like roses 
We've fallen apart, fallen apart 
It was written in blood 
On a fucking suicide note 
the night before he died 
It was written in blood 
It was written in blood 
It was written in blood 
My god, written in blood 
It was written in blood 
It was written in blood 
Oh my god! 
It was written... in blood 
Like roses, we blossom and die 
Like roses, we blossom and die 
We've fallen apart (Fallen apart!) 
We've fallen apart (Fallen apart!) 
Fallen apart 
We've fallen 
These roses, white roses 
Roses 
My roses 
White roses
