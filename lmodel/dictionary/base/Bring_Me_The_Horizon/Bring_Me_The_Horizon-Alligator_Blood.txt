Let's play a game of Russian Roulette.
I'll load the gun, you place the bets.
Tell me who will make it out alive.
Let's play a game of Russian Roulette.
I'll load the gun, you place the bets.
Tell me who will make it out alive.
Over, and over, and over again.
We play the same old games.
Cards kept close to my chest:
That way the secret's kept.
So wear your poker face.
Here's to the fool, here's to the thief.
Fiction is better and you got a taste.
My alligator blood is starting to show.
I know that you know that I know that you know.
Can't call a bluff with a dead man's hand.
My alligator blood is starting to show.
I know that you know that I know that you know.
Can't call a bluff with a dead man's hand.
Cut me up and wear my skin.
Show me how to live.
Tear me down, clean me up.
Now spill my fucking guts.
Just help me find a way.
Just help me find a way.
Just help me find a way.
Just help me find a way.
My alligator blood is starting to show.
I know that you know that I know that you know.
Can't call a bluff with a dead man's hand.
My alligator blood is starting to show.
I know that you know that I know that you know.
Can't call a bluff with a dead man's hand.
Or put a gun to my head and paint the walls with my brain.
Put a gun to my head and paint the walls.
Or put a gun to my head and paint the walls with my brain.
Put a gun to my head and paint the walls.
Now you know.
Now you know.
Now you know.
Now you know, you can go.
You can give up trying.
Should have just called it quits.
Should have just called it quits.
Leave before it's too late.
Now you know, you can go.
You can give up trying.
Should have just called it quits.
Should have just called it quits.
Leave before it's too late.
Let's play a game of Russian Roulette.
I'll load the gun, you place the bets.
Tell me who will make it out alive.
Let's play a game of Russian Roulette.
I'll load the gun, you place the bets.
Tell me who will make it out,
Out alive.
So put a gun to my head and paint the walls with my fucking brain.
Put a gun to my head and paint the walls with my brain.
Put a gun to my head and paint the fucking walls.
