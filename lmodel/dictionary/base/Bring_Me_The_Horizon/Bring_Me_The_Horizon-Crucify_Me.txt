<song artist="Bring_Me_The_Horizon" title="Crucify_Me">
Crucify me and nail my hands to a wooden cross
There is nothing above, there is nothing below
Heaven and hell lives in all of us
And I've been cast astray
I am an ocean, I am the sea
There is a world inside of me
Lost in the abyss, drowned in the deep
No set of lungs could salvage me
Only a shipwreck, only a ghost
Merely a graveyard of your former self
We just watched the waves crash over
And I've been cast astray
There is a hell, believe me I've seen it
There is a heaven, let's keep it a secret
No one needs to know
There is a hell, believe me I've seen it
There is a heaven, let's keep it a secret
No one needs to know
I am an ocean, I am the sea
There is a world inside of me
Lost in the abyss, drowned in the deep
No set of lungs could salvage me
Save yourself, save your breath
The tide's too strong, you'll catch your death
So breathe for me, just breathe
There is a hell, believe me I've seen it
There is a heaven, let's keep it a secret
There is a hell, believe me I've seen it
There is a hell, believe me I've seen it
There is a heaven, let's keep it a secret
There is a hell, believe me I've seen it
Oh, If we make it through the night, if I make it out alive
Lord have mercy and pray for the dead
You say that you can save me, don't hope to ever find me
And I fear I'm too far gone, pray for the dead
Oh, If we make it through the night, if I make it out alive
Lord have mercy and pray for the dead
You say that you can save me, don't hope to ever find me
And I fear I'm too far gone, pray for the dead
Pray for the dead
Pray for the dead
Pray for the dead, yeah
Ladies and gentlemen, can I have your full undivided attention
There's something you all really need to know
There is a hell, believe me I've seen it
There is a heaven, let's keep it a secret
There is a hell, believe me I've seen it
There is a hell, believe me I've seen it
There is a heaven, let's keep it a secret
There is a hell, believe me I've seen it
If we make it through the night, if I make it out alive
You say that you can save me, don't hope to ever find me
And I fear I'm too far gone, pray for the dead
Oh, if we make it through the night, if I make it out alive
Lord have mercy and pray for the dead
You say that you can save me, don't hope to ever find me
And I fear I'm too far gone, pray for the dead
I am the ocean, I am the sea
There is a world inside of me
I am the ocean, I am the sea
There is a world inside of me
I am the ocean, I am the sea
There is a world inside of me
I am the ocean, I am the sea
There is a world inside of me
I am the ocean, I am the sea
There is a world inside of me
I am the ocean, I am the sea
There is a world inside of me
I am the ocean, I am the sea
There is a world inside of me
I am the ocean, I am the sea
There is a world inside of me
