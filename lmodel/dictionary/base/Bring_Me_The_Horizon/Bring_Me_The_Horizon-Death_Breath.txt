The sun goes down, we come out. A different party in a different city.
The sun comes up, we go down.
We lived fast &amp; died pretty.
We're all vampires and we own this fucking night
We're all vampires and we own this fucking 
I'm not homesick. I'm just so sick of going home.
I've been walking these streets for days. In search of blood
Yeah! I'd kill for the sun to never rise again.
Yeah! I'd do anything oh anything. So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight til it breaks. You can't kill us, we will never fucking die.

We're all vampires and we own this fucking night
I wanna sink my teeth into all of you. ALL OF YOU
If only I could make you see how sweet this could be, how sweet this could be
Yeah! I'd kill for the sun to never rise again.
Yeah! I'd do anything oh anything. So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight until it breaks. You can't kill us!!!
You leave a bad taste in my mouth.
So spit it out so spit it out!
You leave a bad taste in my mouth.
So spit it out so spit it out!
You leave a bad taste in my mouth.
So spit it out, spit it out!
You leave a bad taste in my mouth.
So spit it out, spit it out!
Yeah! I'd kill for the sun to never rise again.
Yeah! I'd do anything
Yeah! I'd kill for the sun to never rise again.
Yeah! I'd do anything oh anything. So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight until it breaks. You can't kill us, we will never fucking die.
I'm not homesick. I'm just so sick of going home, of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood
