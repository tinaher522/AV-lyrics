<song artist="Bring_Me_The_Horizon" title="Anthem">
This is an anthem, so fucking sing
A dedication to the end of everything
This is an anthem, so fucking sing (So fucking sing)
A dedication to the end of everything
Someone call an ambulance, I got wounds to attend
Someone call a doctor, I fear this is the end
This happens all the time
This happens every day
But I never seem to quit
The wolves never stay at bay
I hate to say "I told you so"
But fuck it, I told you so
And don't say a word, I already know
This is an anthem, so fucking sing
A dedication to the end of everything
This is an anthem, so fucking sing (So fucking sing)
a dedication to the end of everything
Someone call an exorcist, and help me kill this curse
I can't stop the bleeding, and it's only getting worse
This happens all the time
This happens every day
But I never seem to quit
The wolves never stay at bay
No, they don't stay!
I hate to say "I told you so"
But fuck it, I told you so
And don't say a word, I already know
I already know
This is an anthem, so fucking sing (So fucking sing)
A dedication to the end of everything
Yeah
Get the fuck up
This is it, the sound of giving in
Yeah
Get the fuck up
This is it, the end of everything
Tastes so bitter, feels so sweet
Lost in a dream, never fell asleep
Tastes so bitter, feels so sweet
I've come back to old remedies
This is an anthem, so fucking sing
This is an anthem, so fucking sing
This is an anthem, so fucking sing
A dedication to the end of everything
This is an anthem, so fucking sing (So fucking sing)
A dedication to the end of everything
To the end of everything
This is an anthem, so fucking sing
A dedication to the end of everything
"I feel like my heart is being touched by Christ"
