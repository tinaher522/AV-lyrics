<song artist="Bring_Me_The_Horizon" title="Avalanche">
Cut me open and tell me what's inside
Diagnose me 'cause I can't keep wonderin' why
And no, it's not a phase 'cause it happens all the time
Start over, check again, now tell me what you find
'Cause I'm going out of frequency
Can anyone respond?
It's like an avalanche, I feel myself go under
'Cause the weight of it's like hands around my neck
I never stood a chance, my heart is frozen over
And I feel like I am treadin' on thin ice
Am I broken? What's the chance I will survive?
Don't sugarcoat me, 'cause I feel like suicide
Just give it to me straight 'cause I'm runnin' out of time
I need an antidote, now what can you prescribe?
It's like an avalanche, I feel myself go under
'Cause the weight of it's like hands around my neck
I never stood a chance, my heart is frozen over
And I feel like I am treadin' on thin ice
And I'm goin' under
I need a cure for me 'cause the square doesn't fit the circle
Give me a remedy 'cause my head wasn't wired for this world
I need a cure for me 'cause the square doesn't fit the circle
Give me a remedy 'cause my head wasn't wired for this world
'Cause I'm going out of frequency
Can anyone respond?
'Cause I'm going out of frequency
Can anyone respond?
It's like an avalanche, I feel myself go under
'Cause the weight of it's like hands around my neck
I never stood a chance, my heart is frozen over
And I feel like I am treadin' on thin ice
And I'm goin' under
I need a cure for me 'cause the square doesn't fit the circle
Give me a remedy 'cause my head wasn't wired for this world
I need a cure for me 'cause the square doesn't fit the circle
Give me a remedy 'cause when it hits, well, it hits like an avalanche
