<song artist="Bring_Me_The_Horizon" title="RE:_They_Have_No_Reflections">
I've been dragging the lake for dead kids while you were sleeping
Crossing away the calendar,
Rotting away into the ground
Where you belong!
I don't know what they said,
They all left me for dead.
And when I'm done,
God can have his way with me,
So nail the casket one more time!
I'm ready to go baby.
Nail the casket one more time.
Twist the knife, it wont last forever,
Twist the knife, you know it won't baby!
Twist the knife it won't last forever, forever more.
Do not change the subject,
let's go chase the sunset.
Bring me the horizon!
Bring me the horizon! Now!
Forever, it won't last forever,
So nail the casket.
I HATE ALL MY FRIENDS! THIS MUST END!
