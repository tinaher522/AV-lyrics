<song artist="Bring_Me_The_Horizon" title="It_Never_Ends">
It started off with a one night stand and lingered to a fling 
The sirens and the sergeants didn't seem to mean a thing
Hide your fangs all you want, you still need the blood
Tell us that its different now, you're up to no good
Take my hand, show me the way, we are the children that fell from grace
Take my hand, show me the way, we are the children who can’t be saved
One more nail in the coffin, one more foot in the grave
One more time I'm on my knees, as I try to walk away
How has it come to this?
I've said it once, I've said it twice, I've said it a thousand fucking times
That I'm okay, that I'm fine, that it's all just in my mind
But this has got the best of me and I can't seem to sleep
It’s not because you’re not with me, It’s because you never leave
You say this is suicide?
I say this is a war
And I'm losing the battle
Man down
This is -
This is what you call love? 
This is a war I can’t win
One more nail in the coffin, one more foot in the grave
One more time I'm on my knees, as I try to walk away
Everything I've loved, became everything I lost
I've said it once, I've said it twice, I've said it a thousand fucking times
That I'm okay, that I'm fine, that it's all just in my mind
But this has got the best of me and I can't seem to sleep
It’s not because you’re not with me
It’s because you never leave
It’s not because you’re not with me
It’s because you never leave
Every second, every minute, every hour, every day
It never ends, it never ends
Every second, every minute, every hour, every day
It never ends, it never ends
Every second, every minute, every hour, every day
It never ends, it never ends
Every second, every minute, every hour, every day
It never ends, it never ends
