<song artist="The_Cure" title="Faded_Smiles">
(Haven't got any words)
The barber chair falls to the floor
He rolls in tears
But he cries no more
Someone feels stand through his eyes
And he moves his arm against the light
Tips his hair
Swallows his dreams
The silence drowns his final screams
I said it to the naked child
I'm alone with her
Faded smiles
Tips his hair
Swallows his dreams
The silence drowns his final screams
I said it to the naked child
I'm alone with her
Faded smiles
