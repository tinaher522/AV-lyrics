British sugar bureau
When I told you what I
And I
And I wouldn't ask you to pretend
That we were one
And still another time
Forget all the lies
Forgive me the wounds
And all the world was used to love
And yes we'd still be happy in another time
But so what
So what
So please send me icing and decorating sets
I enclose a cheque and postal order number
So what
So what
