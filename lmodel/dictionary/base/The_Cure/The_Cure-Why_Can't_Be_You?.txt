<song artist="The_Cure" title="Why_Can't_Be_You?">
You're so gorgeous, I'll do anything
I'll kiss you from your feet
To where your head begins
You're so perfect, you're so right as rain
You make me, make me hungry again
Everything you do is irresistible
Everything you do is simply kissable
Why can't I be you?
I'll run around in circles 'til I run out of breath
I'll eat you all up or I'll just hug you to death
You're so wonderful, too good to be true
You make me, make me hungry for you
Everything you do is simply delicate
Everything you do is quite angelicate
Why can't I be you?
You turn my head when you turn around
You turn the whole world upside down
I'm smitten, I'm bitten, I'm hooked, I'm cooked
I'm stuck like glue
You make me, make me hungry for you
Everything you do is simply dreamy
Everything you do is quite delicious
Why can't I be you? Why can't I be you?
Why can't I be you?
