<song artist="The_Cure" title="Fight">
Sometimes there's nothing to feel
Sometimes there's nothing to hold
Sometimes there's no time to run away
Sometimes you just feel so old
The times it hurts when you cry
The times it hurts just to breathe
And then it seems like there's no one left
And all you want is to sleep
Fight fight fight
Just push it away
Fight fight fight
Just push it until it breaks
Fight fight fight
Don't cry at the pain
Fight fight fight
Or watch yourself burn again
Fight fight fight
Don't howl like a dog
Fight fight fight
Just fill up the sky
Fight fight fight
Fight 'til you drop
Fight fight fight
And never never never never never never stop
Fight fight fight
So when the hurting starts
And when the nightmares begin
Remember
You can fill up the sky
You don't have to give in
You don't have to give in
Never give in
