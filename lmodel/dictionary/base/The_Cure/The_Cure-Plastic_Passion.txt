<song artist="The_Cure" title="Plastic_Passion">
Plastic passion is a hard to handle
Plastic passion is a sold out scandal
Oh, it's a plastic passion
Oh, it's a plastic passion
Plastic passion is the ladies lover
Plastic passion is the marble mother
Oh, it's a plastic passion
Oh, it's a plastic passion
Plastic passion is a diamond delight
Plastic passion is the nadir of night
Oh, it's a plastic passion
Oh, it's a plastic passion
Plastic passion is a hycoscine heart
Plastic passion is a transparent tart
Oh, it's a plastic passion
Oh, it's a plastic passion
Plastic passion is a gold guarantee
This plastic passion is murdering me
Oh, it's a plastic passion
Oh, it's a plastic passion
