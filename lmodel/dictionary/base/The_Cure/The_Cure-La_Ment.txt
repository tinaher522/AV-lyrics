<song artist="The_Cure" title="La_Ment">
Today there was a tragedy underneath the bridge
A man walked cold and blue into lament
The sky coloured perfect as the man slipped away
Waving with a last vanilla smile
Waving with a last vanilla smile
Somewhere at a table, two drowned fools
Smoking, drinking water as they talked
Of how they loved our lady
And, oh, the smell as candles die
One more ice cream river body
Flowed underneath the bridge
Underneath the bridge
One more ice cream river body
Flowed underneath the bridge
Underneath the bridge
