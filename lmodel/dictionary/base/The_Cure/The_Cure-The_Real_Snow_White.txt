<song artist="The_Cure" title="The_Real_Snow_White">
You've got what I want
You've got what I want
Yeah, you've got what I want
You've got what I want
You've got what I want
You've got what I want
You've got what I want
Oh yeah, it's only for the night
And I will give it back tomorrow, I swear
She can barely breathe
Don't stare, I know the dress is tight
But it was all I had to wear
Give me what I need, please share
You know it's only right
And I would never lie to you, I wouldn't dare
I made a promise to myself
I wouldn't start with anyone else but
You know how it is with these promises
Made in the heat of the moment
They're made to be broken in two
Sometimes the only thing to do
Oh no, it's all coming back
How I came to in a sticky three-day hole
Didn't see the sign, go slow
Too busy tuning static on the radio
She hissed it in a song "Don't go
It always fades to black"
But that's why I love the trip
It's so inevitable
I made a promise to myself
I wouldn't fall for anyone else but
You know how it is with these promises
Made in the heat of the moment
They're made to be less than they seem
Whenever you've got what I need
And you've got what I need
Yeah, you've got what I need
Yeah, you've got what I need
For a service with a smile
I have to walk in on my hands and roll for free
You say it's all the same
Ennui, you're not the real snow white
The real snow white is on my knee
I didn't need to get ID
It's simply minimum height and getting all dressed up
In seven ways to please, yeah
I made a promise to myself
I wouldn't stay with anyone else but
You know how it is with these promises
Made in the heat of the moment
They're made to be broken one day
If there's no time to get away
Uh-oh, she wasn't made to shine
She was really only ever made to glow
I left her in the dark, no show
Quiet sucking on a line
It was a tricky gun to load and I didn't get to fire
Hi-ho, she's off to work for time
I should have finished out
With higher up than low
Yeah, I made a promise to myself
I wouldn't stop with anyone else but
You know how it is with these promises
Made in the heat of the moment
They're made before right becomes wrong
Whenever you've got what I want
Whenever you've got what I want
Whenever you've got what I want
Whenever you've got what I want
And you've got what I want
You've got what I want
You've got what I want
Oh, yeah
It's only for the night
And I will give it back tomorrow
I swear
