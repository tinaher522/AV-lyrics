<song artist="The_Cure" title="Without_You">
Anything at all, but you know I can't stop
It's life on the moon, all this talk of giving up
Life is too short, for it not to be true
The best idea I think, is for me to go my way
Anything at all, but don't want me to change
Hard to understand, when a plan is this strange
Life is too big, yeah, has to be true
The best idea I think, is for me to go my way
If all that you want, is how it could be
You may as well go now, there's no wait and see
Anything at all, but don't ask me to
You have to accept, I can't ever play safe
Life is too real, for it not to be true
The best idea I think, is for me to go my way
If all that you want, is how it could be
You may as well go, no, there's no wait and see
We'll always be wrong
If all I won't give, is all that you want
It's a strange way to live and let live
And all that you do, is measure me up, falling shorter than you
It's a strange way to love, and be as I want
Oh I know that you know, I can't fake, change, or stop
So anything at all, you know I won't choose
If all you could win, is all I would lose
When life is too right, yeah, has to be true
The best idea I think, is for me to go my way
(Whispered) Without you
