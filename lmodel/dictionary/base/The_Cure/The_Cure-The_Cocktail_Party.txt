<song artist="The_Cure" title="The_Cocktail_Party">
Blood of Mary
Fills my glass 
Spins crimson in the gloom
Sipping on another cocktail
Waking up in another room
Gaze out on the river
Of the gleaming city sky
Sipping on another cocktail
Watching the world go by
Surge of twilight
Blazing shadows
Seeing things not there
Television flickers 
On channel One
And static cracks the air
Come sunshine
Come next time
Come...
Oh! Come along with me!
I will show you life
I will give you my eyes
I will give you security... 
Yesterday was yesterday
A nightmare of my past
Sipping on another cocktail
From the same glass
Everyday was yesterday
A nightmare of my past
Sipping on another cocktail
From the same glass...
