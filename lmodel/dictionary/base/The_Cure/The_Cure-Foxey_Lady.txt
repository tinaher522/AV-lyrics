<song artist="The_Cure" title="Foxey_Lady">
You know you're a cute little heart-breaker
You know you're a sweet little love-maker
I want to take you home
I won't do you no harm
You've got to be all mine
All mine
I see you come down on the scene, Foxy
You make me want to get up and scream, Foxy
I've made up my mind
I'm tired of wasting all my precious time
You've got to be all mine
All mine
