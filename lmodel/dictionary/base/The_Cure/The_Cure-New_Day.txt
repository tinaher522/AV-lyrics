<song artist="The_Cure" title="New_Day">
New day
In heaven the ground is waiting
For the dust
The seed
My love once more
I shout
New day
Hold the air and gasp in life
This solid dance
This cold cold night
Is gone...
The dark heat throbs
The fools' sweat swims
The hazy lights
The deadly sins
Are gone...
Crack the stone
Invade my head
Dropping honey dropping dead again
The silence shouts
Across the gap
Another dreaming
Love me again
Shout...
