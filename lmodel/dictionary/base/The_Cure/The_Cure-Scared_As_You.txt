<song artist="The_Cure" title="Scared_As_You">
You know those things I said
All those things that made you cry
I didn't really mean that stuff
I didn't really mean that stuff
All I ever really mean
When I scream and shout the way I do
Is I don't know
I really don't
I'm just the same as you
You know those things I said
All those things that made you
Run away from me
I didn't mean a word
I didn't really mean I don't believe
All I ever really mean
When I rant and rave the way I do
Is I'm scared
I'm scared
I'm just as scared as you
And sometimes it's so hard
Not to just throw it all away
Sometimes it's so hard
Not to just throw it all away
Like all those things I said
All those things that made you cry
I didn't really mean that stuff
I didn't really mean to say goodbye
You know those things I said
All those things that made you
Run away from me
I didn't mean a word
I didn't really mean I don't believe
All I ever really mean
When I scream and shout the way I do
Is I'm scared
I'm scared
I'm just as scared as you
