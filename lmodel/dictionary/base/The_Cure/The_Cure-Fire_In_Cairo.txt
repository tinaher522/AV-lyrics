<song artist="The_Cure" title="Fire_In_Cairo">
Slowly fading blue
The eastern hollows
Catch the dying sun
The night time follows
Silent and black
Mirror pool
Mirrors are the lonely place
Where I meet you
See your head
In the fading light
Through the dark
Your eyes shine bright
We burn like fire
Burn like fire in Cairo
Burn like fire
Burn like fire in Cairo
Shifting crimson veil
Silken hips
Slide under my hand
Swollen lips
Whisper my name
And I yearn
You take me in your arms
And start to burn
F.I.R.E.I.N.C.A.I.R.O
Then the heat disappears
And the mirror fades away
F.I.R.E.I.N.C.A.I.R.O
Burn like fire
Burn like fire in Cairo
Burn like a fire in Cairo
Burn like a fire, fire, fire
Blaze like a fire in Cairo
Blaze like fire, fire, fire
Flare
We burn like fire
Burn like fire in Cairo
