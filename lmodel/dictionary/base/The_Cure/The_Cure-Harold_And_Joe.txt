<song artist="The_Cure" title="Harold_And_Joe">
Nothing ever gets in my way
Nothing ever gets on my mind
Nothing ever makes me stop to think about
Nothing of the kind
Nothing ever loses me sleep 
Nothing ever wins my heart
Nothing ever makes me want to sing along
And nothing makes me want to start
If I'm falling down a mountain
Then I pick myself up
If I crash into an iceberg
I don't give a frightful look around..
If I am burning then I put myself out
I'm so completely full
I scare the world
Oh all the world 
All inside out
Just look around...
Nothing ever puts me out
Nothing ever pulls me in
Nothing ever makes me want to jump
And nothing makes me want to begin
Nothing ever gets me down
Nothing ever gets me uptight
And nothing ever makes me run around
And nothing makes me feel I might
If I'm hanging from a peach tree
Then I cut myself down
And if I look into the sun
I just turn up the sound
And if I swallow deathcap loverooms
Then I spit them right out
I'm so completely full
I scare the world
Yeah all the world
Inside out
Nothing ever gets in my way
Nothing ever gets on my mind
Nothing ever makes me stop to think about
Nothing of the kind
Harold and Joe
Go go go!!!
Yeah...
Sing birds sing...
