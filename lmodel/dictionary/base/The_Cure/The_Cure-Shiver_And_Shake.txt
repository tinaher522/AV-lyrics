<song artist="The_Cure" title="Shiver_And_Shake">
You're just a waste of time
You're just a babbling face
You're just three sick holes that run like sores
You're a fucking waste
You're like a slug on the floor
Oh you're useless and ugly and useless and ugly
And I shiver and shake
When I think of how you make me hate
I want to smash you to pieces
I want to smash you up and screaming
I want to smash you helpless down on the floor
Smash you until you're not here anymore
Yeah I shiver and shake
I shiver and shake
