"I think it's dark and it looks like rain", you said
"And the wind is blowing like it's the end of the world", you said
"And it's so cold, it's like the cold like you were dead"
Then you smiled for a second
"I think I'm old and I'm feeling pain", you said
"And it's all running out like it's the end of the world", you said
"It's so cold, it's like the cold if you were dead"
Then you smiled for a second
Sometimes you make me feel like I am living at the edge of the world
Like I am living at the edge of the world
"It's just the way I smile", you said
