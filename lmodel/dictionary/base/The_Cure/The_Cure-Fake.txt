<song artist="The_Cure" title="Fake">
I can't fly I never really could
I don't feel you ever really understood at all
I can't fly I never really could
I just throw my arms out as I fall
Always say you know me, you - you don't know me at all
Only want to hold me, but I'm not here to hold
Always say you know me, but you don't know me at all
Only want to show me, but I'm not yours to show, no no no
I don't dream I never really did
Don't believe you ever really took this into good
No I don't dream I never really did
I just wake up, make up as I should
No I don't dream
No I don't dream
No I don't dream
I won't see I never really would
I don't sense you ever realised it right
No I won't see I never really would
I just roll my eyes up out of sight
Always say you know me, you - you don't know me at all
Only want to hold me, but I'm not here to hold
Always say you know me, but you don't know me at all
Only want to show me, but I'm not yours to show
I can't ever come back, if I never go
I don't ever explain, if I never know
I won't ever take it, if I never give
And if I never live, if I never live, if I never live
