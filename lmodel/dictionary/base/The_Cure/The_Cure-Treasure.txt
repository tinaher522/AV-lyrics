<song artist="The_Cure" title="Treasure">
She whispers, 'Please remember me
When I am gone from here'
She whispers, 'Please remember me
But not with tears
Remember I was always true
Remember that I always tried
Remember I loved only you
Remember me and smile
For it's better to forget
Than to remember me and cry'
'Remember I was always true
Remember that I always tried
Remember I loved only you
Remember me and smile
For it's better to forget
Than to remember me and cry'
