<song artist="The_Cure" title="This_Morning">
Nothing left to feel
Nothing more to do
Nothing left to give
Nothing more in you
Nothing else to have or hold
Nothing left but time to go
Years go by
We didn't really say that much at all
And months just fly
We didn't ever really touch at all
Weeks always run down
We didn't really get that close at all
And days fall out
We didn't ever really know at all
And then we're here in a room
Too clean and too bright
She stares at you for an hour
You stare into the light
For one last hour in the room
So mean and so white
I stare at her in this room
As she stares into the night
Nothing left to feel
Nothing more to do
Nothing left to ask
Nothing more of you
Nothing else to share or show
Nothing left but time to go
In his eyes as we turned
No eternity of life
In his eyes as we turned
No infinity of why
In his eyes as we turned
No beautiful goodbye
In his eyes as we turned
Nothing but tears
In his eyes as we turned
Nothing but tears
(Spoken part)
The dawn call was broken, short, disconnected, far away
I couldn't understand too much of what was being said
A matter of minutes, peacefully, so sorry
I had to think to breathe, my heart bursting in my head
We moved in silence through a slowly waking world of pale grey rain
And as we drove, a strange sun split the sky
In that moment I knew nothing would ever be the same again
I knew nothing would ever be the same again
Nothing would ever be the same again
(End spoken part)
The days fall out
The weeks always run down
The months just fly
The years go by
And then we're here in a room
Too clean and too bright
I stare at you for an hour
You stare into the light
For one last hour in the room
So mean and so white
You stare at me in this room
As I stare into the night
Nothing left to feel
Nothing more to do
Nothing left to take
Nothing more from you
Nothing else to need or know
There's nothing left at all but time to go
