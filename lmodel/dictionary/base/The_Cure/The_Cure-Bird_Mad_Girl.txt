<song artist="The_Cure" title="Bird_Mad_Girl">
This girl has got a smile
That can make me cry
This girl just burns with love
She's burning, burning deep inside
Nighttime, nighttime sets my house on fire
Oh, I'll turn into the melting man
I'll lose my life to feel
I feel desire
Oh, I should feel
Like a polar bear
It's impossible
She flies outside this cage
Singing girlmad words
I keep her dark thoughts deep inside
As black as stone and mad as birds
But wild, wild, wild and never turn away
Oh, sends me all her love
She sends me everything
She sends me everywhere
Oh, I could be
A polar bear
Oh, I could be
A polar bear
It's impossible
I try to talk
The sky goes red
I forget
So fill in my head
With some of this
Some of that
Some of every word she says
Oh, nighttime, nighttime sets my house on fire
Oh, I'll turn into the melting man
I'll lose my life to feel
I feel desire
Oh, I should be
A polar bear
Oh, I should be
A polar bear
But it's impossible
