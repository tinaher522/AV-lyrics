<song artist="The_Cure" title="Screw">
When you screw up your eyes
When you screw up your face
When you throw out your arms
And keep changing your shape
Time to taste in your mouth
Time to taste on your tongue
On the film on your eyes
Of the way I've become
What do I do when you screw up your eyes?
What do I do when you screw up your face?
What do I do when you throw out your arms
Fall on the floor and keep changing your shape?
Jump right into your mouth
Jump around on your tongue
And the film on your eyes
Of the way I've become
Makes me sick at the way that I try anything in the world
To impress that I'm doing this only for you
It's only for you
Only for you
