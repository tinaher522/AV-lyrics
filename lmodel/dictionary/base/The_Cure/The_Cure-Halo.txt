<song artist="The_Cure" title="Halo">
I never felt like this with anyone before
You only have to smile and I'm dizzy
You make the world go round
A thousand times an hour
Just touch my head
And send me spinning
I never felt like this with anyone before
You show me colours and I'm crying
You hold my eyes in yours
And open up the world
I can't believe all this
I want to keep this feeling
Deep inside of me
I want you always in my heart
You are everything
I never felt like this with anyone before
You fill my head all full of rainbows
And all the rainbows end
Is every step you take
Just to be with you forever
I want to keep this feeling
Deep inside of me
I want you always in my heart
You are everything
