<song artist="The_Cure" title="Play_With_Me_(Three_Imaginary_Boys_Studio_Outtake)">
I paint your nails and brush your hair
Until you are so very beautiful
I whisper in your ear and on my knees
I tell you that you are desirable
You don't need to cage me
To close all the doors
As long as you keep me
I will always be yours
Play with me
Play with me
I stroke your neck and lick your neck
And do just what you tell me to do
Sometimes I'll beg [Incomprehensible]
But only when you want me to
Don't need to cage me
To close all the doors
As long as you keep me
I will always be yours
Play with me
Play with me
I know that you need me
I know that you care
You know that I may not love you
But I will always be there
I paint your nails and brush your hair
And tell you that you are so very beautiful
I whisper in your ear and on my knees
I tell you that you are desirable
Don't need to cage me
To close all the doors
As long as you keep me
I will always be yours
Won't you play with me?
Play with me
Won't you play with me?
Please come play with me
