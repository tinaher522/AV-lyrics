<song artist="The_Cure" title="Dressing_Up">
Going under slowly
Oh, it never seems too late
Going under
So slow
Dressing up to kiss
Dressing up to touch all this
Dressing up, dressing up
Oh, I'm dressing up to dance all week, oh
Dressing up, dressing up
Oh, I'm dressing up to sleep
Dressing up to kiss
Dressing up to be all this
Oh, I could eat your face
I could eat all of you
Dressing up, dressing up
Dressing up, dressing up
Oh, this night will never let me go
Dressing up, dressing up
Dressing up, dressing up
This night will never let me go
Going under slowly
Never seems too late
Going under slowly
You'll pick me up again
