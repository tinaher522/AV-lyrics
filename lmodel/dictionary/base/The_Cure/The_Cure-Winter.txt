<song artist="The_Cure" title="Winter">
The soul lives forever
Always ends sometime
Now I'm alone, alone and cold
Under painted skies
Remembering the love that we came alive
And I can only scream
As a lonely cry
Forever
The summer goes by upon the wind
Goes by as though it has never been
I lift my hand to wipe the tears
The tears 
I just can't go on
Now my love has gone away
Now my imaginary world is fading fast
Dreams I dreamed could never last
I lived my innocence in the past
And my broken heart
The summer goes by upon the wind
Goes by as though it has never been
I lift my hand to wipe the tears
The tears
I just can't go on
Now my love has gone away
The summer goes by upon the wind
Goes by as though it had never been
I lift my hand to wipe the tears
The tears
I just can't go on
Now my love has gone
I just can't go on
Now my love has gone away
