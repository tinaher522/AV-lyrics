<song artist="The_Cure" title="Just_One_Kiss">
I remember the time that you rained all night
The Queen of Siam in my arms
Remember the time that the islands sank?
But nobody opened their eyes
Remember that time that the trees fell down?
The wood crashing through the wall
Remember the sound that could wake the dead?
But nobody woke up at all
Somebody died for this...
Somebody died... for just one kiss
Remember the time that the sky went black?
We waited alone on the sands
Remember the taste of the raging sea?
But nobody held out their hands
Somebody died for this...
Somebody died... for just one kiss
Just one kiss  (x2)
