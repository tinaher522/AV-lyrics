<song artist="The_Cure" title="Freakshow">
I can't believe it, I must be dreaming
She turns the sound down, says "I am heaving
This is a freakshow" and I am screaming
She spins the world round, I want to stop
Bitter sweet again, her opening move
Down and out in black, soft, shiny, and smooth
Looks like the alien crowd got groove
She burns her name into my arm but I can never get through
To play the game she's trying to lose
Her ultraviolet makes it harder to choose
Looks like the edge of the earth got moved
She blurs a way across the floor, I spin to swallow the view
And it's the same sway
Yeah, it's the same slide
It's the same stare
Oh, it's the same smile
Yeah, it's the same but
It's not quite right
Oh, it's insane, she shakes like a freak
Stuck in the middle of the room for a week
Looks like the only way to get on the beat
Is take her up on how to swing but I am missing my feet
And it's the same sway
Yeah, it's the same slide
It's the same swish
Oh, it's the same smile
Yeah, it's the same but
It's not quite right
I'm in a step out
She's two more steps down
For three steps up, clap
And go around, ow
It makes my head buzz
She wants to come now
I try to stop
Always infradig, her finishing move
Up and down in black, soft, shiny, and smooth
Looks like the alien crowd got groove
She cuts a number out my arm but I can never get through
To play this game she's trying to lose
The stuff from Mars makes it harder to choose
Looks like the final frontier got moved
She blurs a way across the floor, I spin to swallow the view
And it's the same sway
Yeah, it's the same slide
It's the same strip
Oh, it's the same smile
Yeah, it's the same but
It's not quite right
I can't believe it, I must be dreaming
She turns the lights up, says she is leaving
This is a freakshow and I am beaten
She spins the world round, I have to stop
