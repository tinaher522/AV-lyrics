<song artist="The_Cure" title="Empty_World">
Stiff as toys and tall as men, swaying like the wind-torn trees
She talked about the empty world, with eyes like poison birds
She talked about the armies, that marched inside her head
And how they made her dreams go bad, but oh how happy she was,
How proud she was to be fighting in the war
In the empty world
Stiff as toys and tall as men, swaying like the wind-torn trees
She talked about the empty world, with eyes like poison birds
