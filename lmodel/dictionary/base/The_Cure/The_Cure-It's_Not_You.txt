<song artist="The_Cure" title="It's_Not_You">
You wear your smile like it was going out of fashion
Dress to inflame but douse any ideas of passion
Carry your love in a trinket hanging round your throat
Always inviting, always exciting but I must not take off my coat
Well I'm tired of hanging around
I want somebody new
I'm not sure who I've got in mind
But I know that it's not you
That it's not you
You ask me questions that I never wanted to hear
I am the only one just until you finish this year
I would murder you if I had the alibi here in my hand
But you just laugh because you don't understand
That I'm tired of hanging around
I want somebody new
I'm not sure who I've got in mind
But I know that it's not you
It's not you
That it's not you
No, it's not you
It's not you
