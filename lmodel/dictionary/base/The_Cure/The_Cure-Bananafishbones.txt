<song artist="The_Cure" title="Bananafishbones">
Curl into a ball like you have more fun
That would make it faster
Why do you do it, do you do it, do you act like you?
Why do you do it, do you act like you?
Don't fight, go red and blue and black and white and sell this, sell this
Or leave it senseless like a suck on a gun?
"Put a piece of metal in your head" you said
"Make you dead, make you hip-a, hip-a, hip-a, hip-a"
A palace of stones of your bananafishbones
I'd buy you a hundred years old
To celebrate our difference, theorise and talk yourself
Until you're tired and old
Disappear everywhere and watch me
Pull my lips apart
Exploit, inspire, encourage
Be responsible for this
I don't think, I don't think
I make use of all this time
Oh, kill me, kiss me once and then we'll throw it away
And then we'll throw it away
Curl into a ball like you have more fun
That would make it faster
Why do you do it, do you do it, do you act like you?
Why do you do it, do you act like you?
Don't fight, go red and blue and black and white and sell this sell this
Or leave it senseless like a suck on a gun?
"Put a piece of metal in your head" you said
"Make you dead, make you hip-a, hip-a, hip-a, hip-a"
I don't think, I don't think
I make use of all this time
Oh, kill me, kiss me once and then we'll throw it away
And then we'll throw it away
Tell me about the games you play
Oh, turn off the lights
And tell me about the games you play
