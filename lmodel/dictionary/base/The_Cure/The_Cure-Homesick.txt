<song artist="The_Cure" title="Homesick">
Hey, hey
Just one more and I'll walk away
All the everything you win
Turns to nothing today
And I forget how to move
When my mouth is this dry
And my eyes are bursting hearts
In a blood-stained sky
Ah, it was sweet
It was wild
And oh, how we
I trembled
Stuck in honey
Honey, cling to me
So just one more
Just one more go
Inspire in me the desire in me
To never go home
Ah, just one more
And I'll walk away
All the everything you win
Turns to nothing today
So just one more
Just one more go
Inspire in me the desire in me
To never go home
To never go home
