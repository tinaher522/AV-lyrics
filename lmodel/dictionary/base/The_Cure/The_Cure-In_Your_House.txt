<song artist="The_Cure" title="In_Your_House">
I play at night in your house
I live another life
Pretending to swim
In your house
I change the time in your house
The hours I take
Go so slow
I hear no sound in your house
Silence
In the empty rooms
I drown at night in your house
Pretending to swim
Pretending to swim
