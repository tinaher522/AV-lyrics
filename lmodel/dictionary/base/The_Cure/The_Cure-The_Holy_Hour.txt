<song artist="The_Cure" title="The_Holy_Hour">
I kneel and wait in silence as one by one the people slip away
Into the night, the quiet and empty bodies kiss the ground before they pray
Kiss the ground and slip away
I sit and listen dreamlessly, a promise of salvation makes me stay
Then look at your face and feel my heart pushed in
As all around the children play the games they tired of yesterday
They play
They play
I stand and hear my voice cry out. A wordless scream at ancient power
It breaks against stone. I softly leave you crying
I cannot hold what you devour. The sacrifice of penance in the holy hour
