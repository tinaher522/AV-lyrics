Yeah I actually wanna worship far away from the sea
All the babies, all the children are the same
Sometime I saw you when I watched you on a fence
And i burn ???
When i see you I get my sailor vice 
Up to someone
Follow to satisfy
Why can't I be you?
Why can't I be you?
Sometime I saw you listen to a monkey in a park
??? around ???
I'll see you this
I see you that
Every way you want me to
I will eat you up alive
Every way you want me to
Seed a little fire
Why can't I get - awwwwwwwww
Why can't I be you?
Why can't I be you?
