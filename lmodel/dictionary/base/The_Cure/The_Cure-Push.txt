<song artist="The_Cure" title="Push">
Go, go, go
Go, go, go
Push him away
No, no, no
No, no, no
Don't let me stay
He gets inside to stare at her
The sleeping mouth, the mouth that knows
The secret you
Always you
A smile to hide the fear away
Oh, smear this man across the walls
Like strawberries and cream
It's the only way to be
Exactly the same clean room
Exactly the same clean bed
But I've stayed away too long this time
And I've got too big to fit this time
