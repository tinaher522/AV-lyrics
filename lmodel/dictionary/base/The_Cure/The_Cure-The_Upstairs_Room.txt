<song artist="The_Cure" title="The_Upstairs_Room">
I love it all, these games we play
I close my eyes, you run away
I'm sure I asked you to stay
But now you're gone
Today I feel the grey pulse in my head
I turn off the lights and crawl into bed
I try to think of sunshine but my body goes wet
With the first crash of thunder
I don't think
I can know
Anyone but you
That's for sure
Oh, when it gets to four it's my turn to go
Oh, the kiss so alcoholic and slow
Arranging me for Saturday, I thought you would know
That I always sleep alone
I don't think
I can know
Anyone but you, dear
That's for sure
That's for sure
That's for sure
That's for sure
The upstairs room is cool and bright
We can go up there in summer
And dance all night
Your sister started talking at a minute after ten
So everyone jumped up and then fell over again
In April you can join them and stare at me
At the ghost from your past
At the ghost from your past
At the ghost from your past
At the ghost from your past
I don't think
I can know
Anyone but you, dear
That's for sure
That's for sure
