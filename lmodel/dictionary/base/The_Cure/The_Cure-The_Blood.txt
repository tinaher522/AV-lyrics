<song artist="The_Cure" title="The_Blood">
Tell me who doesn't love,
What can never come back
You can never forget how it used to feel
The illusion is deep
It's as deep as the night
I can tell by your tears you remember it all
[Chorus]
I am paralyzed, by the blood of Christ
Though it clouds my eyes, I can never stop
How it feels to be dry,
Walking bare in the sun
Every mirage I see, is a mirage of you
As I cool in the twilight
Taste the salt on my skin
I recall all the tears, all the broken words
[Chorus]
When the sunsets glow drifts away from you
You'll no longer know
If any of this was really true at all
