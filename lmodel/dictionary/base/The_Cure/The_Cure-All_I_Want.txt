<song artist="The_Cure" title="All_I_Want">
Tonight I'm feeling like an animal
Tonight I'm howling inside
Tonight I'm feeling like an animal
Tonight I'm going wild
And all I want
Is to be with you again
And all I want
Is to hold you like a dog
And all I want
Is to be with you again
With you again
Just to hold you like a dog
Tonight I'm screaming like an animal
Tonight I'm losing control
Tonight I'm screaming like an animal
Tonight I'm getting so low
And all I want
Is to be with you again
And all I want
Is to hold you like a dog
And all I want
Is to be with you again
With you again
Just to hold you like a dog
That's all I want
Just to hold you like a dog
Just to hold you like a dog
That's all I want
And all I want
Is to hold you like a dog
