<song artist="The_Cure" title="Truth_Goodness_And_Beauty">
I've been waiting for the lies to end
Holding for the bad to go
I've been hanging for the ugliness to change
Waiting for a world too true
Holding for a world too good
Hanging for a world too beautiful
Wishing for a girl too true
Hoping for a girl too good
Hungry for a girl too beautiful
'All I say is a lie,' she sighs
Nothing I say is true
'And all I do is bad,' she cries
Nothing I do is good
And yeah all I am is ugly
Nothing I am is beautiful at all
Don't get this world
I don't get this girl
So look, but you won't see it
Listen, and you won't hear it
Reach out, and you won't hold it
You can't know it, but you can free it
You can't name it, but could feel it
I've been waiting for the lies to end
Holding for the bad to go
I've been hanging for the ugliness to change
Waiting for a world too true
Holding for a world too good
Hanging for a world too beautiful
Wishing for a girl...like you
Hoping for a girl...like you
Hungry for a girl...like you
No...not like you...you
