<song artist="The_Cure" title="Icing_Sugar">
You're delicious
Dreaming
Slack jawed
Green eyed
Rub my nose in icing sugar
Smooth as
When this cold and deadly blade
Kisses the fruit
So soft and gently breathing
Under your skin
Oh I'll empty you
I'll empty you
As empty as a boy can be
As empty as a boy can be
