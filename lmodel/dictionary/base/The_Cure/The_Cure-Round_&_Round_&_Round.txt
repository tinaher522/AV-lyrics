<song artist="The_Cure" title="Round_&_Round_&_Round">
Round and round and round and round and round we go
Trying so hard to get a hold of
Everyone here, we've got to show how
Much we love them all
We squeak with idiot fake surprise
Flap our hands and flutter our eyes and
Lap up all their stupid lies
Yeah, we've got to love them all
And I really don't know why we do it like this
Imitation smiles and how 'it's wonderful to be here'
I'm really not sure what we're so scared we'll miss
So round and round and round and round and round we go
Hanging on every shape they throw
It's strange the way we can't say no
Until we love them all
So we laugh at every stupid joke
And smoke and choke and point and poke
And gag on countless lines
Oh, how much we love them all
And I really don't know why we do it like this
Imitation smiles and how 'it's wonderful to be here'
I'm really not sure what we're so scared we'll miss
Maybe it's the sex with the drugs and the fools
Or maybe it's the promise of belief?
Maybe it's the pleasure and the pain of the cruel
Or maybe it's the promise of relief?
And I know that we've said it so many times before
Once more and never again
But however many times that we've said it before
Once more is never the end
