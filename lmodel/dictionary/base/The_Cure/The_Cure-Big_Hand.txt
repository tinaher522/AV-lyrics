<song artist="The_Cure" title="Big_Hand">
The big hand makes all of your favorite things
Like all your dreams go small
And all your friends run away
Until your memories fall
And the words don't fit
But the way the big hand smiles
You just won't care about it
The big hand makes all of your favorite things
Like all your days run out
And your hopes disappear
And your smiles just stop
And your eyes go dead
And the shadows start to crawl
In the back of your head
But when the big hand speaks
It's like fireworks and heaven
So you listen don't think
And wish for nothing at all
And when the big hand sings
It's like fireworks and friends
Leaving alone I'm not leaving alone
I'll never leave alone again
So when the big hand holds up all of your favorite things
And with a touch like glass starts to squeeze
You don't ask why me? 
You just slip to the floor
You just slip to your knees
But when the big hand speaks
It's like fireworks and heaven
So you listen don't think
And wish for nothing at all
And when the big hand sings
It's like fireworks and friends
Leaving alone
I'm not leaving alone
Leaving alone never leaving alone
I'll never leave alone again...
