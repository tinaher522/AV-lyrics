<song artist="The_Cure" title="Maybe_Someday_(Acoustic_Mix)">
No I won't do it again
I don't want to pretend
If it can't be like before
I've got to let it end
I don't want what I want
I've had a change of head
But maybe someday
Yeah maybe someday 
I've got to let it go
And leave it gone
Just walk away
Stop it going on
Get too scared to jump
If I wait too long
But maybe someday
Yeah I'll see you smile
As you call my name
Start to feel
And it feels the same
And I know that maybe someday is come
Maybe someday is come again...
So tell me someday's come
Tell me someday's come again
No I won't do it some more
It doesn't make any sense
If it can't be like it was
I've got to let it rest
I don't want what I did
I had a change of taste
But maybe someday
Yeah I'll see you smile
As you call my name
Start to feel
And it feels the same
And I know that maybe someday is come
Maybe someday is coming
If I could do it again
Maybe just once more
Think I could make it work
Like I did before
If I could try it out
If I could just be sure
Then maybe someday is the last time
Yeah maybe someday is the end
Or maybe someday is when it all stops
Or maybe someday always comes again
