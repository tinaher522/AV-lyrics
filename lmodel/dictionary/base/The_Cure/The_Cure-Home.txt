<song artist="The_Cure" title="Home">
Every time I try to tell you how I feel inside 
I always make the same mistake 
Tie myself in knots 
Sometimes even make you cry 
When all I ever want to say 
Is "Nobody else in the whole wide world 
Makes me feel this way... 
Nobody else in the whole wide world 
Takes my breath away" 
Makes me feel so strange inside 
Dazed, confused and starry-eyed 
I couldn't love you more 
Makes me feel the wrong way round 
Inside out and upside down 
I couldn't love you more 
And every time I try to tell you what I really mean 
Nothing seems to come out right 
And I end up murmuring foolishly it makes me want to scream 
How I get so stupefied 
There's nobody else in the whole wide world 
Makes me feel this way 
There's nobody else in the whole wide world 
Takes my breath away 
Makes me feel so strange inside 
Open-mouthed and mystified 
I couldn't love you more 
Makes me feel so upside down 
Muddle-headed round and round 
I couldn't love you more 
Makes me feel so strange inside 
Dazed, confused and starry-eyed 
I couldn't love you more 
Makes me feel the wrong way round 
Inside out and upside down 
Oh I couldn't love you more
