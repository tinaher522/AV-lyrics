<song artist="The_Cure" title="In_Your_House_(Live_In_Amsterdam_Jan._1980)">
Hate talking to people 
Two people's conversation 
Listening to voices 
Voices saying nothing
It's all been said before 
All been said before
Takes my arm around her 
Listen what she says 
Shameless I rise to my feet 
Shameless I rise to my feet
Takes my life around her 
Again and again and again 
Seems to start confusion 
???
It's all been said before 
It's all been said before 
It's all been said before
