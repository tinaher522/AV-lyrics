<song artist="The_Cure" title="The_Scream">
Yeah, I've been this way before
But something down here changed
The spring sun hanging slower, colder in the sky
And your voice sounds strange
And your voice sounds strange
Yeah, I've been down here before
But this time something really isn't right
Summer sun hangs smaller, paler in the sky
And your eyes are too bright
Your eyes are too bright
It's like everything I know
Is twisted out and wrong
The fall sun hanging flatter, lower in the sky
And your smile is gone
Your smile is gone
It's like twisted out, I know
Now I can't wake to break apart this dream
Winter sun hangs weaker, older in the sky
And you start to scream
And you start to scream
Scream and you scream
This is not a dream
This is how it really is
There isn't any other this
It's not a dream
Scream and you scream
Why you have this need
Why you can't be satisfied
Always want another why
You have this need
Scream and you scream
Dare me to believe
Dare me now to show I care
One last chance to make the dare
Me to believe
Scream and you scream
How we ended here
How we got from then to now
Never really followed how
We ended here
