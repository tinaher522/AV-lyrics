<song artist="The_Cure" title="Charlotte_Sometimes">
All the faces - All the voices blur
Change to one face - Change to one voice
Prepare yourself for bed...
The light seems bright &amp; glares on white walls
All the sounds of, Charlotte sometimes
Into the night with, Charlotte sometimes
Night after night, she lay alone in bed
Her eyes so open to the dark
The streets all looked so strange
They seemed so far away,
But Charlotte did not cry
The people seemed so close,
Playing expressionless games
The people seemed so close,
So many other names...
Sometimes I'm dreaming,
Where all the other people dance
Sometimes I'm dreaming, Charlotte sometimes
Sometimes I'm dreaming,
Expressionless the trance
Sometimes I'm dreaming,
So many different names
Sometimes I'm dreaming,
The sounds all stay the same
Sometimes I'm dreaming,
She hopes to open shadowed eyes
On a different world, come to me
Scared princess - Charlotte sometimes
On that bleak track  (See the sun is gone again)
The tears were pouring down her face
She was crying and crying for a girl
Who died so many years before...
Sometimes I dream,
Where all the other people dance
Sometimes I dream, Charlotte sometimes
Sometimes I dream,
The sounds all stay the same
Sometimes I'm dreaming,
There are so many different names
Sometimes I dream... (x2)
Charlotte sometimes, crying for herself
Charlotte sometimes,
Dreams a wall around herself,
But it's always with love, with so much love
It looks like everything else, of Charlotte -
Sometimes... So far away,
Glass sealed and pretty... Charlotte sometimes
