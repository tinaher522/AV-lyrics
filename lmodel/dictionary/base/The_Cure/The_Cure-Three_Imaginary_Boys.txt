<song artist="The_Cure" title="Three_Imaginary_Boys">
Walk across the garden in the footsteps of my shadow
See the lights out, no one's home
In amongst the statues stare at nothing
In the garden moves
Can you help me
Close my eyes and hold so tightly
Scared of what the morning brings
Waiting for tomorrow never comes
Deep inside the empty feeling
All the night time leaves me
Three imaginary boys
Slipping through the door
Hear my heartbeat in the hallway
Echoes round and round inside my head
Drifting up the stairs I see the steps behind me disappearing
Can you help me
Close my eyes and hold so tightly
Scared of what the morning brings
Waiting for tomorrow never comes
Deep inside the empty feeling
All the night time leaves me
Three imaginary boys singing:
My sweet sweet child
The moon will change your mind
See the cracked reflection standing still before the bedroom mirror
Over my shoulder, no one's there
Whispers in the silence
Pressing close behind me
Pressing close behind
Can you help me
Can you help me
