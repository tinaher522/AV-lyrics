<song artist="The_Cure" title="Meathook">
I went into the butchers
I said I wanted some
Meat
Pass me some of that steak over there
You know
I lost my heart to a meathook
That butcher man was some lady
He really stole my
Pass me some of that
Slaughterhouse art
I lost my heart to a meathook
There's a meathook in my heart
Tearing me all apart
Ripping out my insides
But I just can't get away
I just can't
Meathook
