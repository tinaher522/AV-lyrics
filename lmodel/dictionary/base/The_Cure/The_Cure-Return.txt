<song artist="The_Cure" title="Return">
Oh, I really love it here
Oh, you've thought of it all
Candlelight, coconut ice
And fur on the floor
And I really love the way you wear
Your hair And nothing more
So tell me, what is going on?
I was sure that I'd already gone
But all you say is we're all spinning
It's really not just me
But that doesn't seem to help me figure out how I can be
A prisoner in PVC a minute after three
It didn't used to be like this
Must be all that sleep I missed
Yeah, but I really love it here
You've done everything to please
Stolichnaya, banco de Gaia
Bad timing on TV
And I really love the way you turn
Your smile into striptease
But I'm still not sure what's going on
And I can't help feeling something's wrong
But you just say that we're all spinning
And it's really not just me
But that doesn't seem to help me figure out how I can be
Still wrapped inside your rubber as I wriggle at your feet
No, it didn't used to be like this
Must be something strange I kissed
Maybe when my eyes were closed?
So tell me, what is going on?
I'm sure that I've already gone
But all you say is we're all spinning
And it's really not just me
But that doesn't seem to help me figure out how I can be
Still fixed inside your fantasy
A TV refugee
So tell me, what is going on?
Just can't help feeling something's wrong
Or is it right this way I feel?
Someone get me out of here
I'm waiting on my knees
