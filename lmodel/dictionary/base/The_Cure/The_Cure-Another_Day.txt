<song artist="The_Cure" title="Another_Day">
The sun rises slowly on another day
The eastern sky grows cold
Winter in water colours
Shades of grey
Something
Something holds me
Holds me hypnotized
I stare at the window, stare at the window
Waiting for the day to go
Winter in water colours
Shades of grey
