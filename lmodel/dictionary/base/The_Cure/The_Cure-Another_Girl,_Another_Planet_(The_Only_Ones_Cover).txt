<song artist="The_Cure" title="Another_Girl,_Another_Planet_(The_Only_Ones_Cover)">
I always flirt with death 
I could kill, but I don't care about it 
I can face your threats 
Stand up tall and scream and shout about it 
I think I'm on another world with you 
I'm on another planet with you 
You always get under my skin 
I don't find it irritating 
You always play to win 
I don't need rehabilitating 
Another girl, another planet 
Another girl, another planet 
Space travels in my blood 
And there ain't nothing I can do about it 
Long journeys wear me out 
Oh God we won't live without it 
Another girl is loving you now 
Another planet, forever holding you down 
Another planet
