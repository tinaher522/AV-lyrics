<song artist="The_Cure" title="Just_Heaven">
Show me, show me, show me
How you do that trick?
"The one that makes me scream", she said
"The one that makes me laugh", she said
Threw her arms around my neck
Show me how you do it?
And I promise you
I promise that I'll run away with you
I'll run away with you
Spinning on that dizzy edge
Kissed her face and kissed her head
Dreamed of all the different ways
I had to make her glow
"Why are you so far away?" She said
"Why won't you ever know
That I'm in love with you
That I'm in love with you?"
You, soft and only
You, lost and lonely
You strange as angels
Dancing in the deepest oceans
Twisting in the water
You're just like a dream
You're just like a dream
Daylight licked me into shape
I must have been asleep for days
Moving lips to breathe her name
I opened up my eyes
And found myself alone
Alone, alone above a raging sea
That stole the only girl I loved
And drowned her deep inside of me
You, soft and only
You, lost and lonely
You just like heaven
