<song artist="The_Cure" title="Taking_Off">
Tomorrow I can start again
With back to earth and carry on
The same as I did yesterday
Yeah, I'll pick it up once more
And morning, I'll be onto it
From square one start and push it for a bit
Like I do every day
I'll get it down for sure
But tonight I climb with you
Tonight, so high with you
Tonight I shine with you
Tonight, oh, I'm so alive with you
Tomorrow I'll begin anew
With heavy head to hold it
As I do it all like yesterday
Yeah, I'll break it out again
And morning I'll be there in time
For clock back move and make it for awhile
To get through every day
I roll it out the same
But tonight I climb with you
Tonight, so high with you
Tonight I shine with you
Tonight I'm so alive
With you it's always here and never there
With you it's always here and never where
With you it's always here and never how
With you it's always here and always now
Tomorrow I will start again
With back to earth and carry on
The same as I did yesterday
Yeah, I'll pick it up once more
And morning I'll be onto it
From square one start and bit a for it push
Like I do everyday
I'll get it down for sure
But tonight I climb with you
Tonight, so high with you
Tonight I shine with you
Tonight
