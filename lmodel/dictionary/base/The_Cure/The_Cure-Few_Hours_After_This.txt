<song artist="The_Cure" title="Few_Hours_After_This">
The look before I go is the look for you
You only have to look and it will all come true
And we can fall outside
Into the fizzy nights
Or pull me down in here, you know it's all the same
I only want to see if you are happy again
Or we can roll around
And find out upside down, oh
A few hours after this and we're apart again
Like two white checks, like opposite poles
In a secret game
Like nothing like these I suppose
I really should have known by the cut of your smile
That the answer would be simple
It still took you a while to get it out of me
I thought you'd do it easily
Just put your hands around my heart and squeeze me 'til I'm dry
I never thought you'd ever start to ever ask me why
Just put your hands around my heart and squeeze me 'til I'm dry
I never thought you'd ever start to ever ask me why
I never saw you again
I never saw you again
I never saw you again
I never saw you again
