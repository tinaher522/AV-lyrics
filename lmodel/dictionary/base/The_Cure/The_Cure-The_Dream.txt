<song artist="The_Cure" title="The_Dream">
You're too far away
Too far away to touch
And this mother's love inside me
Hurts too much
Prettily waving
Playing on the sand
Dreaming of everything
Dancing, dancing in our hands
Dancing, dancing
Dancing, dancing
Dancing, dancing
Dancing, dancing
Dizzy, dizzy, dizzy as I speak
Like a tumbling cat
I watch in fascination
Like a vampire bat
Don't do it, don't do it, don't do it, don't do it
Don't give it away
Oh, we'll use it up tomorrow
If we don't use it today
We don't use it today
If we don't use it today
If we don't use it today
If we don't use it today
Rest your head
Oh, just put it outside
All wrapped up in ribbons
The night, the dream, the time love died
The night
The dream
The time
Love died
We pushed it in our mouths
Pushed it deep inside
All wrapped up in ribbons
The night, the dream, the time love died
The night
The dream
The time
Our love died
