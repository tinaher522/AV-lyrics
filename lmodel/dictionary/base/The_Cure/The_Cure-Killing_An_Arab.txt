<song artist="The_Cure" title="Killing_An_Arab">
Standing on a beach with a gun in my hand
Staring at the sea and staring at the sand
Staring down the barrel at the Arab on the ground
See his open mouth, but hear no sound
I'm alive
I'm dead
I'm the stranger
Killing an Arab
I can turn and walk away or I can fire the gun
Staring at the sky, staring at the sun
Whichever I choose, it amounts to the same
Absolutely nothing
I'm alive
I'm dead
I'm the stranger
Killing an Arab
Feel the steel butt jump, smooth in my hand
Staring at the sea, staring at the sand
Staring at myself, reflected in the eyes of
The dead man on the beach
(The dead man on the beach)
I'm alive
I'm dead
I'm the stranger
Killing an Arab
