<song artist="The_Cure" title="Kyoto_Song">
A nightmare of you, of death in the pool
Wakes me up at quarter to three
I'm lying on the floor of the night before
With a stranger lying next to me
A nightmare of you, of death in the pool
I see no further now than this dream
The trembling hand of the trembling man
Hold my mouth, to hold in a scream
I try to think - To make it slow
If only here is where I go
If this is real - I have to see
I turn on fire, &amp; next to me
It looks good, it tastes like nothing on Earth  (x2)
Its so smooth - It even feels like skin
It tells me how it feels to be new  (x2)
A thousand voices whisper it true
It tells me how it feels to be new
And every voice belongs,
Every voice belongs to you
