<song artist="The_Cure" title="Object">
You know you turn me on
Eyes so wide and legs so long
But don't try to talk to me
I won't listen to your lies
You're just an object in my eyes
You're just an object in my eyes
Sophisticated smile
You seduce in such fine style
But don't try to fool me
'Cause I can see through your disguise
You're just an object in my eyes
You're just an object in my eyes
But I don't mind
Just don't care
I've got no objections
To you touching me
Object, object
Object, object
Object, object
Object, object
You know just what to do
Lick your lips and I want you
But don't try to hold me
'Cause I don't want any ties
You're just an object in my eyes
You're just an object in my eyes
But I don't mind
No, I just don't care
I got no objections
To you touching me there
You're just an object, object
Object, object
You're just an object, object
You're just an object
