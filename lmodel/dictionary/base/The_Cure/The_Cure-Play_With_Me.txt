<song artist="The_Cure" title="Play_With_Me">
I paint your nails
And brush your hair
Until you are so very
Beautiful
I whisper in your ear
And on my knees I tell you that you are
Desirable
You don't need to cage me
To close all the doors
As long as you keep me
I will always be yours
Play with me
Play with me
I stroke your neck
And lick your neck
And do just what you tell me to
Sometimes I'll beg
But only when you want me to
Don't need to cage me
To close all the doors
As long as you keep me
I will always be yours
Play with me
Play with me
I know that you need me
I know that you care
You know that I may not love you
But I will always be there
I paint your nails
And brush your hair
And tell you that you are so very
Beautiful
I whisper in your ear
And on my knees I tell you that you are
Desirable
Don't need to cage me
To close all the doors
As long as you keep me
I will always be yours
Won't you play with me?
Play with me
Won't you play with me?
Please come play with me
