<song artist="The_Cure" title="I'm_Cold">
You're begging me to stay
But I'm laughing in your face
You're so desperate
Not to let those years of care
All go to waste
But it was you who wanted love
Not romance
You have to pay the price
My body may be made of fire
But my soul is made of ice
I'm me
I'm cold
I'm cold
I'm told
I'd love to love you girl
But my body has just been sold
