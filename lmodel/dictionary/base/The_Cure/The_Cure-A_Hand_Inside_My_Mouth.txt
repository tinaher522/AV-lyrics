<song artist="The_Cure" title="A_Hand_Inside_My_Mouth">
One more glare 
The moonlight fools
It feels so bad
It feels this good
Baby baby baby
Upside down
Baby baby
Chase me round and round
Baby baby baby
Inside out
Wake me up
With a hand inside my mouth
Stuck and hooked
An inch away from the floor
Six sides to every lie I tell
Maybe more
The american voice
American voice again
It was never quite like this before
It was never quite like this before
Baby baby baby
Chase me down
Baby baby baby
Round and round
Baby baby baby
Inside out
Wake me up
With shame
Baby baby baby
Upside down
Baby baby
Chase me round and round
Baby baby baby
Inside out
Wake me up
With a hand inside my mouth
