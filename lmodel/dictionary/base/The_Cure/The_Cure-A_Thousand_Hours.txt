<song artist="The_Cure" title="A_Thousand_Hours">
For how much longer can I howl into this wind?
For how much longer can I cry like this?
A thousand wasted hours a day
Just to feel my heart for a second
A thousand hours just thrown away
Just to feel my heart for a second
For how much longer can I howl into this wind?
