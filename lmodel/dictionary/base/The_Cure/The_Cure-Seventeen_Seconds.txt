<song artist="The_Cure" title="Seventeen_Seconds">
Time slips away
And the light begins to fade
Everything is quiet now
Feeling is gone
And the picture disappears
Everything is cold now
The dream had to end
The wish never came true
And the girl starts to sing
Seventeen seconds
A measure of life
Seventeen seconds
