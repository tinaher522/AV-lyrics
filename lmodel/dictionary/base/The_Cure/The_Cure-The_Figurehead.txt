<song artist="The_Cure" title="The_Figurehead">
Sharp and open, leave me alone, and sleeping less every night
As the days become heavier and weighted, waiting in the cold light
A noise, a scream tears my clothes, as the figurines tighten
With spiders inside them and dust on the lips of a vision of Hell
I laughed in the mirror for the first time in a year
A hundred other words blind me with your purity
Like an old painted doll in the throes of dance, I think about tomorrow
Please let me sleep, as I slip down the window
Freshly squashed fly, you mean nothing
You mean nothing
I can lose myself in Chinese art and American girls
All the time, lose me in the dark, please do it right
Run into the night, I will lose myself tomorrow
Crimson pain, my heart explodes
My memory in a fire
And someone will listen, at least for a short while
I can never say no, I can never say no to anyone but you
Too many secrets, too many lies
Writhing with hatred
Too many secrets, please make it good tonight
But the same image haunts me in sequence, in despair of time
I will never be clean again
I touched her eyes, pressed my stained face
I will never be clean again
Touch her eyes, press my stained face
I will never be clean again
I will never be clean again
I will never be clean again
I will never be clean again
