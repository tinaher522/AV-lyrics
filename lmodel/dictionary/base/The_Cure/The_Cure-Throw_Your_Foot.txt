<song artist="The_Cure" title="Throw_Your_Foot">
It's funny how your face gets bigger
Gets bigger in this atmosphere
And your mouth goes dry
With every move you try
It's so funny here!
Jumping around
Click click click
When you're so slow
It's like the world is stopping...
Fifteen times I try this
And every time I faint
You look at me and
Start to tell the joke
About the man who couldn't stop
Hiccupping...
It would be so perfect
If you would just fall out the window!
Throw your foot away!
You're tired and your face is grey
Like the sad old fool
You groove...
Hey hey hey!!!
