<song artist="The_Cure" title="A_Japanese_Dream">
I'm going back to the land of the blind
Back to the land where the sun never shines
I'm going back there and I'm hoping to find
Everything just as it was before
I left it all behind
I slept at nights there hysterically
Twisted and turned
But I just couldn't get free
Opened my eyes
But I still couldn't see
But I could feel her...
China white girl
So I get down on the floor
Like I am worshipping God
Burning like a monkey
I get down on the floor
Like I am praying to the Lord
Burning like a monkey
Mmmmmm... 
That was a Japanese dream alright
The sound of the storm
And the flickering light
And the way that her scent used to fill up the night like...
Like her scent used to fill up the night
So I get down on the floor
Like I am worshipping God
Burning like a monkey
I get down on the floor
Like I am praying to the Lord
Burning like a monkey
Just look at me now
Just look at me this way
It looks like I am quite insane
It looks like I am trying to eat off my face
It looks like I'm going to the land of the blind anyway...
Back where the sun never shines
Back to the land of the blind
Back in a Japanese dream
