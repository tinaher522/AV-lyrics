<song artist="The_Cure" title="Ocean">
I don't think I'm any closer now
Than I was at fifteen
I still don't know
What I really want
Or how I really feel
Sometimes I think
I've seen too much
Sometimes nothing at all
And sometimes I think
I just forgot
What I was looking for
But I still need to believe in you
I still need to know you'll never
Never give up
I believe in you...
So how can you ever let
My hope turn to despair?
How can you ever stop
Telling me you care?
But I still need to believe in you
I still need to know you'll never
Never give up
I believe in you...
So how can you ever let
My hope turn to despair?
Tell me you believe it too
Tell me that you care
How can you ever let
My hope turn to despair?
How can you ever stop
Pretending?
