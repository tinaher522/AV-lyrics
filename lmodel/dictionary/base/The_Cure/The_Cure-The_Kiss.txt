<song artist="The_Cure" title="The_Kiss">
Kiss me, kiss me, kiss me...
Your tongue is like poison...
So swollen, it fills up my mouth...
Love me, love me, love me...
You nail me to the floor...
And push my guts all inside out...
Get it out, get it out, get it out...
Get your fucking voice, out of my head...
I never wanted this...
I never wanted any of this...
I wish you were dead  (x2)
I never wanted any of this...
I wish you were dead  (x2)
