<song artist="The_Cure" title="Mr._Pink_Eyes">
You look so cool
Oh I don't think!
Just fall over 
Be like me
Mr. Pink Eyes
Your mind is blank
And mine's away
Oh you can't see
You can't smell
Mr. Pink Eyes
It's got to be jazz!
That's what she wants
You are so vile
Mr. Pink Eyes
Oh give me a look
Give me a look
Or sit on my head
Or jump on my foot
Do something!
