<song artist="The_Cure" title="Watching_Me_Fall">
I've been watching me fall for it seems like years
Watching me grow small
I watch me disappear
Slipping out my ordinary world
Out my ordinary eyes
Yeah slipping out the ordinary me 
Into someone else's life
Into someone else's life...
There's a thin white cold new moon 
And the snow's coming down
And the neon bright Tokyo lights
Flicker through the crowd
I've been drifting around for hours 
And I'm lost and I'm tired
When a whisper in my ear 
Insatiable breeze
Why don't you follow me inside?
Yeah the room is small
The room is bright
Her hair is black
The bed is white
And the night is always young
Is always young
Always young
The night is always young...
Yeah I've been seen stripped to the bone 
In the mirror on the wall
Seeing her swallow him whole
Like it's not me at all
She holds out her hands 
And I follow her down to my knees
And the sucking inside 
Insatiable smiles
You will forget yourself in me...
Yeah the room is small
The room is bright
Her eyes are black
The bed is white
And the night is always young
And the night goes on and on
And the night is always young
And the night is never over and over and over and over and over...
And then it's gone
And then it's gone
Yeah then it's gone
Yeah it's a cruel mean cold new day 
And outside the snow is still coming down
And in the blood red Tokyo bed 
I watch me coming round
She pulled him down for hours
Deeper than I've ever been
And as I fall in the mirror on the wall
I'm watching me scream
I'm watching me scream
I'm watching me scream
I'm watching me scream
Yeah I've been watching me go for it must be years
Watching me get slow
I watch me disappear
And one day, yeah I know
I won't come back at all...
And always over and over
In his ordinary eyes
I'm watching me fall
I'm watching me fall
I'm watching me fall
I'm watching me fall
