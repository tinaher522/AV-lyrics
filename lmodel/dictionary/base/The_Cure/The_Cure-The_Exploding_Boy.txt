<song artist="The_Cure" title="The_Exploding_Boy">
I couldn't hear a word you said, I couldn't hear at all
You talked until your tongue fell out and then you talked some more
I knew if I turned, knew if I turned, I'd turn away from you
And I couldn't look back. And I couldn't look back
Tell yourself we'll start again. Tell yourself it's not the end
Tell yourself it couldn't happen, not this way
Not today. Not today
I couldn't hear a word you said, I couldn't hear at all
You talked until your tongue fell out and then you talked some more
I knew if I turned, knew if I turned, I'd turn away from you
And I couldn't look back. And I couldn't look back
Tell yourself we'll start again. Tell yourself it's not the end
Tell yourself it couldn't happen, not this way
Not today. Not today
Not today. Not today
