<song artist="The_Cure" title="Home_Sick">
Hey, just one more and I'll walk away all
The everything you won turns to nothing today
I forget how to move when my mouth is this
Dry and my eyes are bursting hearts in a blood
Stained sky, yeah, it was sweet, it was wild and oh
How we I trembled stuck in honey, honey
Cling to me so just one more, just one more go
Inspire in me the desire in me to never go home
To never go home
Hey, hey, just one more and I'll walk away
All the everything you won turns to nothing today
[Incomprehensible], just one more go inspire in me
The desire in me to never go home
To never go home
