<song artist="The_Cure" title="The_Caterpillar">
Flick-a, flick-a
Here you are
Cat-a, cat-a
Caterpillar girl
Flowing in and filling up my hopeless heart
Oh, never, never go
Oh, I dust my lemon lies
With powder pink and sweet
The day I stop is the day you change
And fly away from me
You flicker and you're beautiful
You glow inside my head
You hold me hypnotized, I'm mesmerized
Your flames, the flames that kiss me dead
I dust my lemon lies
With powder pink and sweet
The day I stop is the day you change
And fly away from me
Flick-a, flick-a
Here you are
Cat-a, cat-a
Caterpillar girl
Flowing in and filling up my hopeless heart
Oh, never, never go
Oh, I dust my lemon lies
With powder pink and sweet
The day I stop is the day you change
And fly away from me
Cat-a, cat-a
Caterpillar girl
Cat-a, cat-a
Caterpillar girl
Cat-a, cat-a
Caterpillar girl
Cat-a, cat-a
Caterpillar girl
