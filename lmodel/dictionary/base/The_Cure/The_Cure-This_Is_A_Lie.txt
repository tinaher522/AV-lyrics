<song artist="The_Cure" title="This_Is_A_Lie">
How each of us decides
I've never been sure
The part we play
The way we are
How each of us denies
Any other way in the world
Why each of us must choose
I've never understood
One special friend
One true love
Why each of us must lose
Everyone else in the world
However unsure
However unwise
Day after day
Play out our lives
However confused
Pretending to know
To the end
But this isn't truth
This isn't right
This isn't love
This isn't life
This isn't real
This is a lie
How each of us believes
I've never really known
In heaven unseen
And hell unknown
How each of us dreams
To understand anything at all
Why each of us decides
I've never been sure
The part we take
The way we are
Why each of us denies
Every other way in the world
However unsure
However unwise
Day after day
Play out our lives
However confused
Pretending to know
To the end
But this isn't truth
This isn't right
This isn't love
This isn't life
This isn't real
This is a lie
This isn't truth
This isn't right
This isn't love
This isn't life
This isn't real
This is a lie
