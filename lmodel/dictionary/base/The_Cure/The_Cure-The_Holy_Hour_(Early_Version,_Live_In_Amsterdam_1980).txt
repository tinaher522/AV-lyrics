<song artist="The_Cure" title="The_Holy_Hour_(Early_Version,_Live_In_Amsterdam_1980)">
So Fuchsia sits,
And watches someone's play,
And all the days break round her head.
???? away.
All around her head,
The children move and sing,
Oh Fuchsia let me hold you,
Fuchsia let me hold you.
And so no-one cares,
Just a sea of happy faces,
All around entertainment goes by.
And I look,
And I see everything standing,
And nothing changes,
And nothing changes.
It's all die [sic],
You just die,
You just die,
You just die.
