<song artist="The_Cure" title="Sugar_Girl">
Oh I wish I could find it funny
You laughing like that
But instead I change into a rage
And run around
Without a face...
I wish I could find it funny
When you never came back
But I don't suppose I'll ever know
The how to keep you
Goodbye sugar girl
Goodbye sugar girl
