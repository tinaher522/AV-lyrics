<song artist="The_Cure" title="Coming_Up">
Yeah, it's a snow white original mix
And she's fixing me
And the heartless thing she does is everything I love
It's all I ever need
Yeah, it's a skin tight sensational strip
And she's tripping me
And the shameless way she turns
Is all I ever dream
You ask me why I use it
It could be just a way to pass the time
I never really choose it
It's just another play to lose
My mind
Yeah, it's a bright light promotional taste
And she's wasting me
And the tearless time she breaks is everytime I ache
It's all I ever feel
You ask me why I need it
It's maybe just a way to pass the time
I never really mean it
It's just another play to lose
My mind
Yeah, it's a big night emotional kill
And she's thrilling me
And the careless way she hurts
Is all I ever scream
You ask me why I take it
It could be just a way to pass the time
I never really make it
It's just another play to lose
I'm coming up in the dark
And every part of me is bruised, and raw, and pained
I'm coming up in the dark
And every part of me is loose, and sore, and stained
And so I play it when I use it
If I need it, then I take it and I play it all again
And then I hold you
So cold you
Like I know you
Yeah, like I always know and like I always lose
My mind
My mind
Yeah, I play it when I use it
If I need it, then I take it and I play it all again
And then I hold you
So cold you
Like I know you
Like I always know, like I always lose
Like I always lose
Like I always lose
My mind
