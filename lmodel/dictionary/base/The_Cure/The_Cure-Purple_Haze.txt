<song artist="The_Cure" title="Purple_Haze">
Purple haze all in my brain
Lately things don't seem the same
Acting funny but I don't know why
'Scuse me while I kiss the sky
Purple haze all around
Don't know if I'm climbin' up or down
Am I happy or in misery?
Whatever it is, that girl put a spell on me
Help me... Help me...
Purple haze all in my eyes
Don't know if it's day or night
You got me blown, blown my mind
Is it tomorrow or the end of time?
Help me... Help me...
