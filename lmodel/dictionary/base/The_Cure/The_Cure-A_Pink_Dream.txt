<song artist="The_Cure" title="A_Pink_Dream">
Rio sunrise
Sucking on a straw
I rub my head
And stagger out the door
And head into the bright new
Beautiful day
And the way she pulls me in
Sucks my breath away
I asked her for some time
And she just made me it
I asked her maybe why?
And she just gave me it
Never smile never stare
She doesn't seem to care at all
Never cry never scream
She doesn't really seem
To need me at all...
Fourteen weeks I stay away from home
A hundred days a part of me unknown
A part in pink
And perfect moments play
And as a wonder of the world
She sucks my breath away
I asked her for some time
And she just made me it
I asked her maybe why?
And she just gave me it
So I asked her could be heaven?
And she just prayed me it...
She didn't want to know my name
She didn't want to know
How long we had together
Spending time as if
Tomorrow never comes
I didn't want to know the end
I didn't want to go but
Slowly found me home again
And slow again tomorrow comes...
But it was all so far away
And so long ago
I hardly ever think about her anymore
Except sometimes
When the summer twilight breeze
Carries me the scent of faraway rain
I remember...
And she still sucks my breath away
