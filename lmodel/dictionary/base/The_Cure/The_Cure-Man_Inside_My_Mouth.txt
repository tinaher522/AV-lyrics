<song artist="The_Cure" title="Man_Inside_My_Mouth">
I woke up at seven and my body was vibrating
I was wrapped up in a blanket, I was gray, damp and sore
The bedroom was an engine and my heartbeat was erratic
Like I think, I'm at the racing, like the night before
I remember one girl standing, one was sitting on the ground
One was holding me up, the other pulling me down
And I couldn't decide which one was real
Because there wasn't a sound, like I was pregnant again
I woke up at seven and my body was vibrating
I was wrapped up in a blanket, I was gray, damp and sore
The bedroom was an engine and my heartbeat was erratic
Like I think, I'm at the racing, like the night before
"Don't move, don't smile, don't blink, don't even breathe"
And she said, "Or the photograph will spoil and cut you off at the head"
So I was sucking, I was sucking like a fat lady would
But I couldn't hold it down another second
"Don't twitch, don't shout, don't think, don't even breathe"
She said, "Or the photograph will spoil and cut you off at the head"
So I was sweating, I was sweating like a fat lady would
And I woke up with a man inside my mouth
This won't hurt at all
