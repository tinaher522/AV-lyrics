<song artist="The_Cure" title="The_Reasons_Why">
I won't try to bring you down about my suicide
Got no need to understand about my big surprise
I won't beg to hang you up about my love of life
If you promise not to sing about the reasons why
I am writing you a letter, getting better
Can I see you, when
All the lights go out together, blame the weather
Yeah, the cold again
In the darkness for a second
I am sure I see them smiling then
I feel them calling me
Yeah, they are calling me
And I am falling through the stars
You remember now?
Yeah, I am falling in their arms
You remember how?
Oh, I am falling through the skies
You remember this?
I am falling in their eyes
You remember the kiss?
I wont try to pull you in about my sacrifice
Makes no sense to get upset about the other side
I won't beg to put you out about my right to die
If you promise not to sing about the reasons why
I am calling you at midnight, feeling alright
Can I tell you, when
On the line no sound but my words
Must be night birds on the wire again
In the silence for a second
I am sure I hear them laughing then
I feel them calling me
Yeah, they are calling me
And I am falling through the stars
You remember now?
Yeah, I am falling in their arms
You remember how?
Oh, I am falling through the skies
You remember this?
I am falling in their eyes
You remember our kiss?
"We know", they said
"You're holding on
To nothing left
Of something gone"
"We know", they said
"In letting go
Of fear and dread
And all you know
You'll lose the need
Of certainty
And make-believe
Eternity
To find the true
Reality
In beautiful
Infinity"
But I won't try to bring you down about my suicide
If you promise not to sing about the reasons why
