<song artist="The_Cure" title="Alt.end">
Yeah, it's a big bright beautiful world
Just the other side of the door
Six billion beautiful faces
But I saw them all before
No, this is not about running out on you
Not a case of right or wrong
It's only that it's over and done for me
It's already been and gone
And I don't want another go around
I don't want to start again
No, I don't want another go around
I want this to be the end
I want this to be the end
I don't want to start again
I want this to be the last thing we do
It for me and you
For all my dreams came true
Yeah, I know I should care if you come with me
Yeah and I should care if you go
Really should care about your love or your hate of me
I should care but I don't
It's not about giving up on you
It's not a case of do or die
It's simply that it's over and out for me
There's no more room inside
And I don't want another run around
I don't want to start again
No, I don't want another run around
I want this to be the end
I want this to be the end
I don't want to start again
I want this to be the last thing we do
It for me and you
For all my dreams came true
Yeah, it's a big bright beautiful world out there
Just the other side of this door
Six billion beautiful faces await
But I saw it all before
No, this is not about running out on you
Not a case of right or wrong
It's only that it's over and done for me
It's already been and gone
And I don't want another go around
I don't want to start again
No, I don't want another go around
I want this to be the end
I want this to be the end
I don't want to start again
I want this to be the last thing we do
This to be it for me and you
This to be the last we go through
This to be the end
For all my dreams came true
