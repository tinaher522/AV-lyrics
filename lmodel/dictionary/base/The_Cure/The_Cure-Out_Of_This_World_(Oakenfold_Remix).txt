<song artist="The_Cure" title="Out_Of_This_World_(Oakenfold_Remix)">
When we look back at it all
As I know we will
You and me wide eyed
I wonder will we really remember
How it feels to be this alive
And I know we have to go
I realize
We only get to stay so long
Always have to go back to real lives
Where we belong
Where we belong
Where we belong 
And we think back to all this
And I'm sure we will
Me and you
Here and now
But we forget the way
It really is
Why it feels like this
And how
And we always have to go
I realize
We always have to say goodbye
Always have to go back to real lives
The real lives are the reason why
We want to live another life
We want to feel another time
Another time
Another time...
To feel another time
When we look back at it all
As I know we will
You and me wide eyed
I wonder will we really remember
How it feels to be this alive
And I know we have to go
I realize
We always have to turn away
Always have to go back to real lives
But real lives
Are why we stay for another dream
Another day
For another world
Another way
For another way
One last time before it's over
One last time before the end
One last time before it's time to go... again
