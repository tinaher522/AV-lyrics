<song artist="The_Cure" title="Ariel">
Golden midnight
Taking us across the water
Holy love sing
We're falling close in every other
As dawn breaks I wonder
Sun's growing old
Ours is not to wonder
To never grow old
To never grow old
Oh Ariel
I will always feel right out here
???
???
Sister and brother
Never loved each other like this
??? on the water
And never fall
You never fall
Ariel
Ariel...
