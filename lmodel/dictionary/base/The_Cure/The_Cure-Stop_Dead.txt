<song artist="The_Cure" title="Stop_Dead">
Let me forget
Let me forget
Or let me go 
Let me go
I'll keep it quiet as a whisper
I'll keep it low low low...
Never!
The biggest word I ever heard
Stop dead
Stop dead
You're getting too close...
Before you even opened your eyes
I moved about a million ways
I killed about a million people
And filled about half a day
Before you even opened your eyes
You had to have to ask me who
I love it...
I mean you...
My face was in your hands
You looked into my eyes
You said I tasted right
And swallowed me alive
