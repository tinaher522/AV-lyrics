<song artist="The_Cure" title="Winter_(Three_Imaginary_Boys_Studio_Outtake)">
The soul lives forever, always ends sometime
Now I'm alone, alone and cold under painted skies
Remembering the love that we came alive
I know when I can scream as a lonely cry forever
The summer goes by upon the wind
Goes by as though it has never been
I lift my hand to wipe your tears
Your tears
I just can't go on
Now my love has gone away
Now my imaginary world is fading fast
Dreams I dreamed could never last
I left my innocence in the past
And my broken heart
The summer goes by upon the wind
Goes by as though it has never been
I lift my hand to wipe the tears
The tears
I just can't go on
Now my love has gone away
The summer goes by upon the wind
Goes by as though it had never been
I lift my hand to wipe the tears
The tears
I just can't go on
Now my love has gone
I just can't go on
Now my love has gone away
