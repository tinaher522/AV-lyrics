<song artist="The_Cure" title="The_Empty_World">
Stiff as toys and tall as men
And swaying like the wind torn trees
She talked about the empty world
With eyes like poisoned birds
She talked about the armies
That marched inside her head
And how they made her dreams go bad
But, oh, how happy she was, how proud she was
To be fighting in the war
In the empty world
Stiff as toys and tall as men
Swaying like the wind torn trees
She talked about the empty world
With eyes like poisoned birds
