<song artist="The_Cure" title="The_Drowning_Man">
She stands twelve feet above the flood, she stares alone across the water
Loneliness grows and slowly fills her frozen body sliding downwards
One by one her senses die, the memories fade and leave her eyes
Still seeing worlds that never were and one by one the bright birds leave her
Starting at the violent sound, she tries to turn but final noiseless
Slips and strikes her soft dark head, the water bows, receives her
Drowns her at its ease
Drowns her at its ease
I would have left the world all bleeding could I only help you love
The fleeting shapes so many years ago, so young and beautiful and brave
Everything was true, it couldn't be a story
I wish it was all true, I wish it couldn't be a story
The words all left me, lifeless, hoping, breathing like the drowning man
Oh Fuchsia, you leave me breathing like the drowning man
Dreaming like the drowning man
Breathing like the drowning man
