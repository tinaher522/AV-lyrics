<song artist="The_Cure" title="Happy_The_Man">
I'll never understand
(Come closer and I'll whisper)
Who was that standing in the rain?
If only I could remember
What he said...
(And how it all began)
Happy the man
With the face that smiles!
But it has to have a name
(Something strong
Something faithful
Something pure... )
How does he look so safe?
He'll never
Never turn away
Happy the man...
