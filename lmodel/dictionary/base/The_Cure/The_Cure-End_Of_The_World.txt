<song artist="The_Cure" title="End_Of_The_World">
Go if you want to
I never tried to stop you
Know there's a reason
For all of this you're feeling
Love its not my call
You couldn't ever love me more
You couldn't love me more
You couldn't love
Me I don't show much
Its not that hard to hide you
See in a moment
I can't remember how to
Be all you wanted
I couldn't ever love you more
I couldn't love you more
I couldn't love
You want me to cry and play my part
I want you to sigh and fall apart
We want this like everyone else
Stay if you want to
I always wait to hear you
Say there's a last kiss
For all the times you run this
Way its not my fault
You couldn't ever love me more
You couldn't love me more
You couldn't love
Love me more
Couldn't ever love me more
I couldn't love you more
I couldn't love
You want me to lie not break your heart
I want you to fly not stop and start
We want us like everything else
Maybe we didn't understand
Not just a boy and a girl
Its just the end of the
End of the world
Me i don't say much
Its far too hard to make you
See in a moment
I still forget just how to
Be all you wanted
I couldn't ever love you more
I couldn't love you more (x4)
