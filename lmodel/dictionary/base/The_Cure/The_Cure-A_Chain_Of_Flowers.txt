<song artist="The_Cure" title="A_Chain_Of_Flowers">
Please wake up
It's so dark and cold
Please wake up
I feel so alone
And I feel so scared
That you're going away
And I feel so scared...
All I want is summer
Stories from before
Just like the day you tried to hide
Behind the churchyard wall
And fell asleep before I came...
I found you
In a chain of flowers
Sleeping like a marble girl
Sleeping in another world...
I'll never tell you
Of all the different ways
You make me so afraid...
