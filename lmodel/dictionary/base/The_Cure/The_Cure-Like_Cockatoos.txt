<song artist="The_Cure" title="Like_Cockatoos">
She walked out of her house
And looked around at all the gardens
That looked back at her house
Like all the faces that quiz when you smile
And he was standing at the corner
Where the road turned dark
A part of shiny wet
Like blood the rain fell black down on the street
And kissed his feet she fell
Her head an inch away from heaven
And her face pressed tight
And all around the night sang out like cockatoos
"There are a thousand things" he said
"I'll never say those things to you again"
And turning on his heel
He left a trace of bubbles bleeding in his stead
And in her head
A picture of a boy
Who left her lonely in the rain
And all around the night sang out like cockatoos
