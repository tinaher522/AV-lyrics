<song artist="The_Cure" title="I_Just_Need_Myself">
I know that I don't love you
But I tell you that I do
But I only buy you flowers
If I want anything from you
You say that if you'll leave me
It will put me on a shelf
But I don't need you girl
I just need myself
I just need myself
You trust in all my lies
You'll believe it when you see it
be forever
So you let me have my way
But I'll make it that I'll leave you
'Cos I just need myself
I just need myself
I know that I don't love you
But I tell you that I do
But I only buy you flowers
If I want anything from you
You think that if you'll leave me
It will put me on a shelf
But I don't need you girl
I just need myself
I just need myself
I just need myself
I just need myself
I just need...
