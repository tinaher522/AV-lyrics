<song artist="The_Cure" title="The_Only_One">
Oh, I love, oh, I love
Oh, I love what you do to my head
When you pull me upstairs
And you push me to bed
Oh, I love what you do to my head
It's a mess up there
Oh, I love, oh, I love
Oh, I love what you do to my heart
When you push me back down
And then pull me apart
Oh, I love what you do to my heart
It's the best, oh yeah
Oh, I love, oh, I love
Oh, I love what you do to my lips
When you suck me inside
And you blow me a kiss
Oh, I love what you do to my lips
It's so sweet in there
Oh, I love
What you do to my hips
When you blow me outside
And then suck me like this
Oh, I love what you do to my hips
It's the beat, oh yeah
You're the only one I cry for
The only one I try to please
You're the only one I sigh for
The only one I die to squeeze
And it gets better every day I play
With you it's such a scream
Yeah, it gets meta every day I say
With you it's so extreme
Yeah, it gets wetter every day I stay
With you it's like a dream
Oh, I love, oh, I love
Oh, I love what you do to my skin
When you slip me on
And slide me in
Oh, I love what you do to my skin
It's a blush in there
Oh, I love
What you do to my bones
When you slide me off
And slip me home
I love what you do to my bones
It's the crush, oh yeah
You're the only one I cry for
The only one I try to please
You're the only one I sigh for
The only one I die to squeeze
And it gets hazier every way I sway
With you it's such a scream
Yeah, it gets mazier every play I say
With you it's so extreme
Yeah, it gets crazier every day I stay
With you it's like a dream
Oh, I love, oh I love
Oh, I love what you do to me
