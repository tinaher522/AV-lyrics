How time will heal
Make me forget
You promised me
Time will heal
Make me forget
You promised me
Love will save us all, yeah
And time will heal
You promised me
You promised me
You promised me
How love will save
Make me forget
You promised me
Love will save
Make me forget
You promised me
Time will heal us all, yeah
And love will save
You promised me
I trusted you
I wanted your words
Believed in you
I needed your words
Time will heal
Make me forget
Yeah, and love
Love will save us all
You promised me another wish, another way
You promised me another dream, another day
You promised me another time
You promised me another life
You promised me
You promised me
You promised me
So I swallowed the shame
And I waited
I buried the blame
And I waited
Choked back years of memories
I pushed down the pain
And I waited
Trying to forget
Trying to forget
Trying to forget
Trying to forget
Trying to forget
You promised me another wish, another way
You promised me another dream, another day
You promised me another time
You promised me another lie
You promised me
You promised me
You promised me
You promised me
And I waited
And I waited
And I waited
And I waited
And I waited
And I waited
And I'm still waiting
