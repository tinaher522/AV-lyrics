<song artist="The_Cure" title="Love_Will_Tear_Us_Apart_(Joy_Division_Cover)">
When routine bites hard
And ambitions are low
And resentment rides high
But emotions won't grow
And we're changing our ways, taking different roads
Then love, love will tears us apart again 
Love, love will tears us apart again
Why is the bedroom so cold
You've turned away on your side
Is my timing that flawed?
Our respect run so dry
Yet there's still this appeal that we've kept through our lives
But love, love will tears us apart again 
Love, love will tear us apart again
You cry out in your sleep
All my failings exposed 
And there's a taste in my mouth 
As desperation takes hold
Just that something so good just can't function no more
But love, love will tear us apart again
Love, love will tear us apart again
