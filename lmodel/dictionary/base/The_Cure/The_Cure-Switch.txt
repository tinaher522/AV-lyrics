<song artist="The_Cure" title="Switch">
Sometime it seems I stopped being myself
And without a word turned into somebody else
Full of wishes wants dreams and desires for a life
Of conceit, and deceit, and repeat, and rewrite
Not sure who I was before this me and I changed
But I know this me now is not really the same
Friends are as strangers and strangers as friends
And I feel like I'm wired in a why
Yeah, my friends are as strangers and strangers as friends
And I feel like I'm lost in a lie
And every day my world gets slower
And colder, and smaller, and older, and lower
And every day my treat
Gets closer to trick
Yeah, every day my world gets slower
And colder, and smaller, and older, and lower
And I'm tired of being alone with myself
I'm tired of being with anyone else
Yeah, I'm tired
Like I'm sick
None of my favourite things are quite right to the mirror, man
I'm screaming at me in the spite of another
False start, dirty worn out and used
Up and down, to the ground, disavowed, so confused
All made up in the belief that me is the same
As the eyes in the glass but I see my eyes change
Friends are as strangers and strangers as friends
And I feel like I'm wired in a why
Yeah, my friends are as strangers and strangers as friends
And I feel like I'm lost in a lie
And every night my world gets quicker
And lighter, and shorter, and tighter, and slicker
Every night my truth gets closer to dare
Yeah, every night my world gets quicker
And lighter, and shorter, and tighter, and slicker
And I'm sick of being alone with myself
And I'm sick of being with anyone else
Yeah, I'm sick of being alone with myself
And I'm sick of being with anyone else
Yeah, I'm sick
Like I'm tired?
Like I'm scared
