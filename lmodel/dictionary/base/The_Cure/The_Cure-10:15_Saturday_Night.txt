<song artist="The_Cure" title="10:15_Saturday_Night">
10:15 on a Saturday night
And the tap drips under the strip light
And I'm sitting in the kitchen sink
And the tap drips
Drip drip drip...
Waiting for the telephone to ring
And I'm wondering where she's been
And I'm crying for yesterday
And the tap drips
Drip drip drip...
It's always the same
