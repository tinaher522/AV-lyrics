<song artist="The_Cure" title="Heroin_Face">
Spit out the shout of a warning
Death is an honour with doubts
So you live in the end
And you mistrust the start
Because you don't think it counts
But you'll pay for yourself
You'll pay for yourself
You're just a heroin face
You see a heroin face in the mirror
And someone is clutching your breath
And you believe in the needle of night
You're only doing your best
But you'll pay for yourself
You'll pay for yourself
You believe in the needle of night
And someone is clutching your breath
So you mistrust the start
By always running away
But you'll never come back
You're just a heroin face
Heroin face
