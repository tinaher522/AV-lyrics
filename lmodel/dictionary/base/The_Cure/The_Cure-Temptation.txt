<song artist="The_Cure" title="Temptation">
My temptation is coming from my heart 
That skips a bit just like a game 
Everytime you call my name, call my name 
Its only you 
I want you too 
Its only you 
I want you too 
Come 
Do you see what I mean talking bout fever 
The fire burns inside of me 
And you can quench me easily, so 
Let me hold you and squeeze you like a fool 
Because I'm crazy about you 
When you sit down and cross your legs, cross your legs 
Temptation 
Temptation 
Come 
Youre sweeping away without a reason 
Unless someone else is loving you 
Id want to have you by my side, by my side 
Temptation 
Temptation 
Its only you 
I want you too! 
Its only you 
I want you too! 
My temptation is coming from my heart 
That skips a bit just like a game 
Everytime you call my name, call my name 
Temptation 
Temptation
