<song artist="The_Cure" title="Down_Under">
Around the sea-green pool we spin
Mermaids sing songs to pull us in
Just when we're here, she slides up slow
To fallllllll down under
Her burning eyes, the only clue to
Who plays, what plays, when plays
You just blew my cue to drown this there
All in wonder
Oh I can't start, I smiled at her twice
Helpless bids
And minds as blank with ice
Disguise the stroke, entice you out
To quote a number
Breathe in and breathe in
As long as you choose
Remember not all games are won
By the last one to lose
Remember...
Tear until his head we break and
Trick is how to fake the first mistake
To rip and take, the easy choice
Too close to care how
Whispered songs and changing stride
Day to night, and every wrong is right
Come dry your eye, bite my lip
We're almost there now
Breathe in and breathe in
As long as you choose
Remember not all games are won
