<song artist="The_Cure" title="All_Kinds_Of_Stuff">
SO MAYBE I TOOK TOO MUCH
Yeah MAYBE I LOST MY TOUCH
OR MAYBE ALL KINDS OF STUFF
Yeah MAYBE...
PROMISE ME IT COMES AROUND AGAIN
IT DOESN'T MATTER IF IT'S TRUE
I BEG YOU PLEASE DON'T TAKE AWAY
THE ONLY HOPE I HAVE TO GET
ANOTHER GO WITH YOU
AND I WILL CHANGE ME BACK
TO HOW I WAS BEFORE
I REALLY UNDERSTOOD
THE EASY WAY TO LESS IS ALWAYS MORE
BEAUTIFUL!
I SHOULD HAVE SUNG IT LIKE THAT
BEAUTIFUL!
I SHOULD HAVE SUNG IT RIGHT BACK
Yeah Yeah Yeah
I SHOULD HAVE SUNG IT TO YOU THEN
Yeah Yeah Yeah...
I SHOULD HAVE SUNG IT TO THE END
MAYBE I WOULDN'T BE HERE NOW
I SHOULD HAVE SUNG IT TO YOU THEN
MAYBE I DIDN'T KNOW HOW
I SHOULD HAVE SUNG IT TO THE END
MAYBE I COULDN'T GET THE TIME
I SHOULD HAVE SUNG IT TO YOU THEN
MAYBE I HADN'T GOT WHY...
SO MAYBE I TOOK TOO MUCH
Yeah MAYBE I LOST MY TOUCH
OR MAYBE ALL KINDS OF STUFF
Yeah MAYBE...
PROMISE ME IT RUNS AROUND
IT DOESN'T MATTER IF IT'S ALL A LIE
I ONLY WANT THE DREAM OF US
TOGETHER LIKE IT WAS
BEFORE YOU REALIZED THE
WHY IT IS WE ONLY GET ONE WAY TO KNOW
A NIGHT
I WISH I'D GOT BACK THEN
THE EASY WAY TO WRONG IS NEVER RIGHT
WONDERFUL!
I SHOULD HAVE SUNG IT LIKE THAT
WONDERFUL!
I SHOULD HAVE SUNG IT RIGHT BACK
Yeah Yeah Yeah
I SHOULD HAVE SUNG IT TO YOU THEN
Yeah Yeah Yeah...
I SHOULD HAVE SUNG IT TO THE END
MAYBE I WOULDN'T BE HERE NOW
I SHOULD HAVE SUNG IT TO YOU THEN
MAYBE I DIDN'T KNOW HOW
I SHOULD HAVE SUNG IT TO THE END
MAYBE I COULDN'T GET THE TIME
