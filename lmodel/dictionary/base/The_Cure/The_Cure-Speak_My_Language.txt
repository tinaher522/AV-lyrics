<song artist="The_Cure" title="Speak_My_Language">
It was only yesterday
Waving arms across the street
Your white face left me blue
Oh, how can I say all the things I have to say to you?
All the people here
All look the same
The little time I spend with you
We drink each other dry
Speak my language
It was only yesterday
My eyes touched yours across the street
We cut the words and waved goodbye
And dropped off the edge of the world
Speak my language
Speak my language
Speak my language
