<song artist="The_Cure" title="Caterpillar">
Flicka flicka flicka, here you are
Cata cata cata, caterpillar girl
Flowing in and filling up my hopeless heart
Oh, never, never go
Oh, I'll dust my lemon lies
With powder pink and sweet
The day I stop's the day you change
And fly away from me
You flicker and you're beautiful
You glow inside my head, you hold me hypnotized
I'm mesmerized your flame's
The flames that kiss me dead
Dust my lemon lies
With powder pink and sweet
The day I stop's the day you change
And fly away from me
Flicka flicka flicka, here you are
Cata cata cata, caterpillar girl
Flowing in and filling up my hopeless heart
Oh, never, never go
Oh, I'll dust my lemon lies
With powder pink and sweet
The day I stop's the day you change
And fly away, away from me
Cata cata cata, caterpillar girl
Cata cata cata, caterpillar girl
Cata cata cata, caterpillar girl
Cata cata cata, caterpillar girl
