<song artist="The_Cure" title="Jumping_On_Someone_Else's_Train">
Don't say what you mean, you might spoil your face
If you walk in the crowd, you won't leave any trace
It's always the same
You're jumping someone else's train
It won't take you long to learn the new smile
You have to adapt or you'll be out of style
It's always the same
You're jumping someone else's train
If you pick up on it quick
You can say you were there
Again and again and again
You're jumping someone else's train
It's the latest wave that you've been craving for
The old ideal was getting such a bore, now, you're back in line
Going not quite as far but in half the time
Everyone's happy, they're finally all the same
'Cause everyone's jumping, everybody else's train
Jumping someone else's train
Jumping someone else's train
Jumping someone else's train
Jumping someone else's train
Jumping someone else's train
