<song artist="The_Cure" title="Last_Dance">
I'm so glad you came
I'm so glad you remembered
To see how we're ending
Our last dance together
Expectant, too punctual
But prettier than ever
I really believe that this time it's forever
But older than me now
More constant, more real
And the fur and the mouth and the innocence turned
To hair and contentment
That hangs in a basement
A woman now standing
Where once there was only a girl
I'm so glad you came
I'm so glad you remembered
The walking through walls
In the heart of December
The blindness of happiness
Of falling down laughing
And I really believed
That this time was forever
But Christmas falls late now
Flatter and colder
And never as bright
As when we used to fall
All this in an instant
Before I can kiss you
A woman now standing
Where once there was only a girl
I'm so glad you came
I'm so glad you remembered
To see how we're ending
Our last dance together
Reluctantly, cautiously
But prettier than ever
I really believe that this time it's forever
But Christmas falls late now
Flatter and colder
And never as bright
As when we used to fall
And even if we drink
I don't think we would kiss
In the way that we did
When the woman was only a girl
