<song artist="The_Cure" title="The_Expolding_Boy">
I couldn't hear a word you said
But I couldn't hear at all
You talked until your tongue fell out
And then you talked some more
I knew if I turned, knew if I turned
I'd turn away from you
And I couldn't look back
And I couldn't look back
Tell yourself we'll start again
Tell yourself it's not the end
Tell yourself it couldn't happen
Not this way, not today, not today
I couldn't hear a word you said
I couldn't hear at all
You talked until your tongue fell out
And then you talked some more
I knew if I turned, knew if I turned
I'd turn away from you
And I couldn't look back
And I couldn't look back
Tell yourself we'll start again
Tell yourself it's not the end
Tell yourself it couldn't happen
Not this way, not today, not today
(Hello, hello)
Not today
(Hello, hello)
Not today
