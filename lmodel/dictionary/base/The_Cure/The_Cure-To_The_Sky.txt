<song artist="The_Cure" title="To_The_Sky">
One perfect morning I was all alone
Listening to the blaze of summer
Drifting
I was falling
I was floating in a golden haze
Breathing in the sky blue sounds
Of memories of other days
And in my dreams I was a child
Flowers in my mouth and in my eyes
And I was floating through the colours of a sky
Up to the stars and angels
Up up up to heaven
Up up up forever
Up up up to heaven
Up up up forever
Turning in my climb
I looked down on a lake
And traced upon the water there
I saw your face
And sang in recollection
Of the times we shared...
Then pushed on ever upward
To the sky
And in my dreams I was a child
Flowers in my mouth and in my eyes
And I was floating through the colours of a sky
Up to the stars and angels
Up up up to heaven
Up up up forever
Up up up to heaven
Up up up forever
