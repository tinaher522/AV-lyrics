<song artist="The_Cure" title="One_More_Time">
And I'd love to touch the sky tonight
I'd love to touch the sky
So take me in your arms
And lift me like a child
And hold me up so high
And never let me go
Take me take me in your arms tonight
Hold me hold me up so high
And never let me down
Hold me hold me up so high
To touch the sky just one more time
Take me in your arms tonight
Take me in your arms just one more time
Just one more time
