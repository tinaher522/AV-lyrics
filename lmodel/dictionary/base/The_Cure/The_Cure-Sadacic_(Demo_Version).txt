<song artist="The_Cure" title="Sadacic_(Demo_Version)">
Shout
Shout
Shout
New day
New lie
I see this again
The same
This time has gone again
This
In the sky
This
Here in my hand
Shout
Jumping on it from the trees
Doing the same
On the air
On the air
Shout
Shout
In heaven
The ground is waiting
See my eye
Once more
It's been the same song
Babbling
On this
On all of you
Shout
Shout
Shout
