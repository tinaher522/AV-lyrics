Oh Fuchsia lays
In her little room
'Nothing can change his face', she screams,
'But I'll never turn back
No I'll never try
Never can take away from me the words'
We face the night
And you live inÂ ??? world
No-one makes the most of time when it's there.
She's gonna pretend to jump,
She's gonna pretend to fall,
It means nothing,
Nothing at all.
Oh Fuchsia
Oh Fuchsia stand and scream
Oh Fuchsia
????
Hold me hold me hold me
Hold me hold me hold me hold me hold me
[Set to tune of "Seventeen Seconds".]
