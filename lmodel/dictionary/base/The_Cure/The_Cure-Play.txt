<song artist="The_Cure" title="Play">
Day after day, I let you down
Promise you to change, then change my mind
And every time I promise you It will all be fine,
It won't be like this next time
The days you wait, turn into years
Always wait - Helpless tears, hopeless nights
And all the fears, it will always be like this
You give me everything you have
Hoping it will someday be enough
To melt my heart - To make me fall in love
Day after day, I let you down
Promise you to change it all,
Then change my mind
And every time I promise you, soon be fine
It won't be like this next time
But tonight we play, I think, the final act
I push too hard and you crack
Walk away - Don't look back
This time you've really gone
You give me everything you have
Knowing it can never be enough
My heart's too old, too hard, too cold for your love
