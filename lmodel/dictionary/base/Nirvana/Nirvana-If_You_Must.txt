<song artist="Nirvana" title="If_You_Must">
I can read, I can write
I can breed, proven plight
Nurse my greed, crease infold
Is it me, or my ego ...
Write some words, make them rhyme
Thesis or story line
Set the mood, something new
Is it me, or my attitude ...
Ahhhhh...!
If you want 
To put off
An image
The extremes
The extremes
Act it out
Practicing
Perfecting
Pressuring
Onto me
Onto me
Onto me
I will wade in the fire
To explain your asylum
Idle times, analyzing
We'll compare all our sightings
You must 
I speak 
To hear 
My voice
I can read, I can write
I can breed, proven plight
Nurse my greed, crease infold
Is it me, or my ego ...
Write some words, make them rhyme
Thesis or story line
Set the mood, something new
Is it me, or my attitude ...
If you want 
To put off 
An image
The extremes
The extremes
Act it out
Practicing
Perfecting
Pressuring
Onto me
Onto me
Onto me
Onto me
Onto me
Onto me
Onto me
