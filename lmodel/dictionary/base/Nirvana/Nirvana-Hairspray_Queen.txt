(Music &amp; Lyrics: Kurt Cobain &amp; Krist Novoselic)

I was your mind, you were my, my enemy
You were mine, I was your, your enemy
You would mind, I was your, your enemy
you were mine, I was was your, your ene
You rang
Your ears rang
I was your mind, you were my, my enemy
You were mine, I was your, your enemy
You would mind, I was your, your enemy
you were mine, I was was your, your ene
At night, The Wishful goddess
At night, She'll wish the hardest
At night, The disco goddess
At night, The bitch go gawd
I was your mind, you were my, my enemy
You were mine, I was your, your enemy
You would mind, I was your, your enemy
you were mine, I was was your, your ene
At night, The Wishful goddess
At night, She'll wish the hardest
At night, The disco goddess
At night, The bitch go gawd
I was your mind, you were my, my enemy
You were mine, I was your, your enemy
You would mind, I was your, your enemy
you were mine, I was was your, your ene
At night, The wishful goddess
At night, She'll wish the hardest
On Sight, The disco goddess
At night, The itch so modest
At night, The Crisco lochness
At night, The mouthful omelette
Out Sight, The fish-filled goblets
At night, The witch go Gawd
