<song artist="Nirvana" title="Sappy">
And if you save yourself
You will make him happy
He'll keep you in a jar
And you'll think you're happy
He'll give you breathing holes
And you'll think you're happy
He'll cover you with grass
And you'll think you're happy now
You're in a laundry room
You're in a laundry room
Conclusion came to you
And if you cut yourself
You will think you're happy
He'll keep you in a jar
And you'll make him happy
He'll give you breathing holes
And you'll think you're happy
He'll cover you with grass
And you'll think you're happy now
You're in a laundry room
You're in a laundry room
Conclusion came to you
You're in a laundry room
You're in a laundry room
Conclusion came to you
And if you fool yourself
You will make him happy
He'll keep you in a jar
And you'll think you're happy
He'll give you breathing holes
Then you will seem you're happy
You'll wallow in your shit
Then you'll think you're happy now
You're in a laundry room
You're in a laundry room
You're in a laundry room
Conclusion came to you
