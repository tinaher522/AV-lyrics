<song artist="Nirvana" title="Veracity">
Jesus was a man but I could take him,
Jesus was a man but I could shake him,
Everyday he failed at what he did,
He fucking lied to all you kids,
Jesus was a man but I could take him.
And I said,
Joseph Smith is the fuckin man,
dum dum dum dum dum,
and that's the end of the song.
