<song artist="Nirvana" title="Son_Of_A_Gun">
Up, up, up and down
Turn, turn, turn around
Round, round, roundabout
And over again
Gun, gun, son of a gun
You are the only one
That makes any difference
What I say
Sun shines in the bedroom when we play
The raining always starts when you go away
Sun shines in the bedroom when we play
The raining always starts when you go away
Up, up, up and down
Turn, turn, turn around
Round, round, roundabout
And over again
Gun, gun, son of a gun
You are the only one
That makes any difference
What I say
Sun shines in the bedroom when we play
The raining always starts when you go away
Sun shines in the bedroom when we play
The raining always starts when you go away
Up, up, up and down
Turn, turn, turn around
Round, round, roundabout
And over again
Gun, gun, son of a gun
You are the only one
That makes any difference
What I say
Sun shines in the bedroom when we play
The raining always starts when you go away
Sun shines in the bedroom when we play
The raining always starts when you go away
Sun shines in the bedroom when we play
The raining always starts when you go away
Sun shines in the bedroom when we play
The raining always starts when you go away
