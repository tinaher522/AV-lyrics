<song artist="Nirvana" title="Pen_Cap_Chew">
Oh lesser God
Oh loathe me
You're lonely 
Bore me
Oh Oh
You get you get you get you get to me
Holy is the time its such an easy way to go 
You get you get you get you get to be
Hide the struggle in the skin under a fingernail
Oh lesser God Oh loathe me Oh lesser God oh you're lonely
Waste your time by saving worthless gullables
Kill a politician and then wear his clothes
This decade is the age of re-hashing
Protest and then go to jail for trespassing
Go home
Waste your time by saving worthless gullables
Kill a Politician and then wear his clothes
This decade is the age of re-hashing
Protest and then go to jail for trespassing
Go home
Can you see the reason for thy entrope? 
Is there something wrong without society?
Has your conscience got to you for AccidentsÂ ?
Is this why unkowningly you eat your pens?
Go home
Go home 
Go home 
Go home
