<song artist="Nirvana" title="I_Hate_Myself_And_Want_To_Die">
Runny nose and runny yolk
Even if you have a cold still
You can cough on me again
I still haven't had my fulfill
In the someday what's that sound?
Broken heart and broken bones
Think of how a castrated horse feels
One more quirky cliche'd phrase
You're the one I wanna refill
In the someday what's that sound?
[Spoken interlude in middle]
Most people don't realize
That two large pieces of coral
Painted brown, and attached to his skull
With common wood screws can make a child look like a deer
