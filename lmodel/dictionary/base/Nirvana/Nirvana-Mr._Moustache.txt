<song artist="Nirvana" title="Mr._Moustache">
Fill me in on your new vision
Wake me up with indecision
Help me trust your might and wisdom
Yes I eat cow, I am not proud
Show me how you question, question
Lead the way to my temptations
Take my hand and keep it clean
Yes I eat cow, I am not proud
Easy in an easychair?
Poop as hard as rock
I don't like you anyway
Seal it in a box
I'm new
Now you
Fill me in on your new vision
Wake me up with indecision
Help me trust your might and wisdom
Yes I eat cow, I am not proud
Show me how you question, question
Lead the way to my temptations
Take my hand and keep it clean
Yes I eat cow, I am not proud
Easy in an easychair?
Poop as hard as rock
I don't like you anyway
Seal it in a box
I'm new
Now you
I'm new
Now you
Ahhhhh
