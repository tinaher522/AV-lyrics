<song artist="Nirvana" title="D-7">
Straight as an arrow
Defect defect
Not straight, not so straight
Reject reject
Towards anti-social
So dull, so dull
Standing on the stairs
Cold, cold morning
Ghostly image of fear
Mayday mayday
Gonna leave this region
They'll take me with them
Straight as an arrow
Defect defect
Not straight, not so straight
Reject reject
Towards anti-social
So dull, so dull
Standing on the stairs
Cold, cold morning
Ghostly image of fear
Mayday mayday
Gonna leave this region
They'll take me with them
Dimension seven
Straight as an arrow
Defect defect
Not straight, not so straight
Reject reject
Towards anti-social
So dull, so dull
Dimension seven
Dimension seven
Dimension seven
Dimension seven
Dimension seven
Dimension seven
Dimension seven
