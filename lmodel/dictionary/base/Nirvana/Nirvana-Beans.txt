<song artist="Nirvana" title="Beans">
Beans, beans, beans
Jessie ate some beans
He was happy, happy, happy
And he ate some beans
Naked, naked, naked
Sitting cross legged
Naked, naked, naked
And he was happy, happy, happy
And he ate some beans
Wine, wine, wine
Jessie ate some wine
He was happy, happy, happy
And he ate some wine
Beans, beans, beans
Jessie ate some beans
And he drank some wine
He was happy, happy, happy
And he drank some beans
