<song artist="Nirvana" title="Clean_Up_Before_She_Comes">
Clean up before she comes 
Clean up before she comes
Clean up before she comes
Clean up before she comes
Clean up before she comes
Living in a dusty town
Living in a dusty town
Living in a dusty town 
Something in her eyes
Must be the smoke from my lungs
Something in her eyes
Must be the smoke from my lungs
I must be getting old
I must be getting older
I'm starting to eat my vegetables
Something in her eyes
Must be the smoke from my lungs
Something in her eyes
Must be the smoke from my lungs
Clean up the dusty town
Living in a dusty town
Living in a dusty town 
Living in a dusty town 
Clean up before she comes
Clean up before she comes
Clean up before she comes
Living in a dusty town
I must be getting old 
I must be getting old 
I'm starting to eat my vegetables

Come On Death
