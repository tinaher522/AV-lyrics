<song artist="Nirvana" title="Scentless_Apprentice">
Like most babies smell like butter
His smell smelled like no other
He was born scentless and senseless
He was born a scentless apprentice
Away
Go away, go away
Every wet nurse refused to feed him
Electrolytes smell like semen
I promise not to sell your perfumed secrets
There are countless formulas for pressing flowers
Away
Go away, go away
I lie in the soil and fertilize mushrooms
Leaking the gas we'll make into perfume
You can't fire me because I quit!
Throw me in the fire and I won't throw a fit
Hey, go away
Go away, go away
Go away, go away
Go away, go away
