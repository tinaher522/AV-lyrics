<song artist="Nirvana" title="Oh,_Me">
If I had to lose a mile
If I had to touch feelings
I would lose my soul
The way I do
I don't have to think
I only have to do it
The results are always perfect
But that's old news
Would you like to hear my voice
Sprinkled with emotion
Vented at your birth
I can't see, the end of me
My whole expanse, I cannot see
I formulate infinity
Stored deep inside me
If I had to lose a mile
If I had to touch feelings
I would lose my soul
The way I do
I don't have to think
I only have to do it
The results are always perfect
But that's old news
Would you like to hear my voice
Sprinkled with emotion
Vented at your birth
I can't see, the end of me
My whole expanse, I cannot see
I formulate infinity
Stored deep inside me
Infinity
Deep inside me
