(Music &amp; Lyrics: Kurt Cobain)

I wasn't seeking him for a father
Not only magnets but I could pry bar his shaft
Gluing my manhood to ze manhole (*said in a smarmy French accent)
like Peppy Lepew would say
hey-hey-hey, then we clash!
I got my diddily spayed
I got my diddily spayed
I got my diddily spayed
I got my diddily
Shouldn't've asked buddy
Shrinking in flesh if the wind blows just right
Jacking themselves off polyester
Highwater jumpsuits and uh, right,
Hey, when am I getting it back?
I got my diddily spayed
I got my diddily spayed
I got my diddily spayed
I got my diddily
I don't know why,
I got a joke too: silly string 
Don't touch the balls
I got a dick, dick -- hear my fucking, hey!
I got my diddily spayed
I got my diddily spayed
I got my diddily spayed
I got my diddily
If you're worried, it's gaining monthly
Fiberglass insulation disguised as cotton candy
Smiling down Steve "El Rancho" Ovule(sp?)
Feeding a cow hamburger raw
Bill has brought me a Tiki idol
Philly Slim reminds me of someone
I'm sick of playing Father Love Bone
Tony and Tennille, Sonny Bono, Charo
Had a nice set of lungs!
I got my philly spayed
I got a little tail
I got my diddily spayed
I got my diddily spayed
 hard
I gotta be around pussy
Don't let me fall
I got a, hey-hey
Well you can't live
We got my diddily spayed
I got diddily spayed
I got diddily spayed
I got diddily spayed
I got diddily spayed
I got diddily spayed
I got diddily
