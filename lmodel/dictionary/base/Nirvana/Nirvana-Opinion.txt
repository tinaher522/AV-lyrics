<song artist="Nirvana" title="Opinion">
Congratulations you have won
It's a years subscription of bad puns.
And a make-shift story of concern
And to set it off before it burns
My opinions. Mmm. Mmm. 
My opinions. Mmm. Mmm.
My opinions. Mmm. Mmm.
My opinions. Mmm. Mmm.
And there seems to be a problem here.
Your state of emotion seems to clear.
You rise and fall like wall street stock
And you had an affect on our happy talk.
Our opinions. Mmm. Mmm.
Our opinions. Mmm. Mmm. 
My opinions. Mmm. Mmm. 
My opinions. Mmm. Mmm. 
Now there seems to be a problem here
The scale of your emotions seems too clear
Now they rise and fall like wall street stock
And they have an affect on our peace talks my opinion

Our opinions. Mmm. Mmm.
Your opinions. Mmm. Mmm. 
Your opinions. Mmm. Mmm. 
Your opinions. Mmm. Mmm. 
My opinions. Mmm. Mmm.
