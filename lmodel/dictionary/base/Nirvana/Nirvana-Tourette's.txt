<song artist="Nirvana" title="Tourette's">
Moderate rock!
Mayday every day, in my heart
Could've had a heart attack, in my heart
We don't know anything, in my heart
We all want something fair, in my heart
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Out of town, out of sight, is my heart
Queen of lies, everyday, in my heart
One more at the phone, in my heart
One more at the door, at my heart
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Mean heart, cold heart, cold heart, cold heart
Cold heart, cold heart, cold heart, cold heart!
Uhh!
