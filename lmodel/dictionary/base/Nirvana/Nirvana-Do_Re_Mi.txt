<song artist="Nirvana" title="Do_Re_Mi">
If I may
And if I might
Lie me down
Weeping
And if I say
What it's like
I might be
Dreaming
If I may
What is right
Some make time
To see me bleed
Those years in his bonet
A phrase from his pocket
And chains of a knowing
life long dream
Dream
Do re mi
If I may
And if I might
Wake me up
And see me
And if I do
And if I lie
Find me out
At sea
And if I may
Cold as ice
I might have to
See me
Dream
The rays in his socket
A phrase from this moment
The chase on his socket I will need
Dream
Do re mi
Wish me good
Wish made light
Find me out
At sea
He's under a wave
Just be quiet
Follow pain
And grieving
Yell 'oh well'
and if I sigh
Seek me out
teeming
If I may
If I might
Golden gun
To bleed
And praise in his pocket
Rays from his women
Chains from his knowing
life long dream
Do re mi
Dream
