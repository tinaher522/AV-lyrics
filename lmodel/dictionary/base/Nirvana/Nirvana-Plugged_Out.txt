<song artist="Nirvana" title="Plugged_Out">
Now I found,
I'm alone
Now I found him here,
Screaming,
Hole in his head,
Death now comes with that... Nevermind
Now opponents said Nirvana,
Where there's nothing left to shoot.
People on MTV,
Wear flowers in their hair,
But for the sake of life and libery and,
Put off alone.
So don't follow him
You only felt the buckets of the raqueteer.
Hey Hey,
My mind,
Like a drug that finds you dreaming,
It takes it just because it can,

Like a gun that finds you sleeping,
Guilty just because it's said.
--Solo--
That's a lot of plants,
That's a lot of trees,
Another promises,
Then will hurt you 
And it's gone Kurt,
Long live the Queen,
Make shifts over, the buckets of the raqueteer.
Like the drug that finds you dreaming,
Like a gun that finds you sleeping,
Now the opponents said Nirvana.
Like the drug that finds you dreaming,
Like a killer, like a man,
Like a blow.
