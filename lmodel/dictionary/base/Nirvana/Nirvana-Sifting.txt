Afraid to grade
Wouldn't it be fun?
Cross, self loss
Wouldn't it be fun?
Wet your bed
Wouldn't it be fun?
Some fear none
Wouldn't it be fun?
Your eyes, teacher said
Your eyes, teacher said
Your eyes, teacher said
Preacher said
Don't have nothing for you
Don't have nothing for you
Don't have nothing for you
Don't have nothing for you
Don't have nothing for you
Don't have nothing for you
Don't have nothing for you
Spell the smell
Wouldn't it be fun?
Search for church
Wouldn't it be fun?
Wet your bed
Wouldn't it be fun?
Cold in cold
Wouldn't it be fun?
Your eyes, teacher said
Your eyes, teacher said
Your eyes, teacher said
Preacher said
Preacher said
Don't have nothing for you
Don't have nothing for you
Don't have nothing for you
Don't have nothing for you
Don't have nothing for you
Don't have nothing for you
Don't have nothing for you
Don't have nothing for you
Don't have nothing for you
Don't have nothing for you
Don't have nothing for you
Don't have nothing for you
Don't have nothing for you
Don't have nothing for you
Don't have nothing for you
Don't have nothing for you
