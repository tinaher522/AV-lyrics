Jesus, don't want me for a sunbeam
Sunbeams are not made like me
Don't expect me to cry
For all the reasons, you had to die
Don't ever ask your love of me
Don't expect me to cry
Don't expect me to lie
Don't expect me to die for thee
Jesus, don't want me for a sunbeam
Sunbeams are not made like me
Don't expect me to cry
For all the reasons, you had to die
Don't ever ask your love of me
Don't expect me to cry
Don't expect me to lie
Don't expect me to die for thee
Don't expect me to cry
Don't expect me to lie
Don't expect me to die for thee
Jesus, don't want me for a sunbeam
Sunbeams are not made like me
Don't expect me to cry
For all the reasons, you had to die
Don't ever ask your love of me
Don't expect me to cry
Don't expect me to lie
Don't expect me to die
Don't expect me to cry
Don't expect me to lie
Don't expect me to die for thee
