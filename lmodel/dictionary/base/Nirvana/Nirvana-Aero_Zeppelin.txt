(Music &amp; Lyrics: Kurt Cobain)

What's the season in a right if you can't have anything?
What's the reason in a rhyme if a plan means everything?
What's the meaning in a crime? Its a fan if anything
Where's the leaning in a line? It's a crime, it's a crime
How a culture comes again? It was all here yesterday
And you swear it's not a trend, doesn't matter anyways
You're only hear to talk to friend nothing new is every day
You could shit upon the stage they'll be fans
They'll be fans
They'll be fans
They'll be fans
All the kids will eat it up, if it's packaged properly
Steal a sound and imitate, keep a format equally
Not an ode, just the facts, where our world is nowadays
An idea is what we lack, it doesn't matter anyways.
All the kids will eat it up, if it's packaged properly
Steal a sound and imitate, keep a format equally
Not an ode, just the facts, where our world is nowadays
An idea is what we lack, it doesn't matter anyways.
