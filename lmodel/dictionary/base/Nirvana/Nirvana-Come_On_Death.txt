Tobi,
when I said slowly, when I said sorry
when I'm lonely, when I'm dead

when I said slowly, when I  ...
Go! Yeaaaaahhhhh, yeeeaaaaaah, yeaaaah
Toni when I said something
When I said sorry
When I said tell me
When!
Deaaaaaaaath, goooooooo, gooooooooo, yeaaaaaah
Come on death, come on death, death, death, come on death
Lonely, blow me, Toni, love me
I arose, come on death, come and see who you'll bait when I
Ruuuuuun! Ruuuuuuun!
Come on death
Come on death
Come on death
Come on death -- ohaaaaaaaahh
Come on death
Come on death
Come on death
Come on death -- ohaaaaaaaahh
