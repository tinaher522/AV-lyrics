<song artist="Nirvana" title="Vendetagainst">
Too pretentious
Feed me
I'm fucking hungry
Degrade me
I want my comply
Life's a fuckin' resume
Experience, credentials
Experienced, imposter
People preaching everyday
White lies
Sitting inside
Lady is sitting with another little fucker and it's
Blasphemy.

Mommy, has a vendetta against daddy
Walls are set up
Baby, is sad to find that daddy
(???)
Life's a fuckin' resume
Experience, credentials
Experienced, imposter
People preaching everyday
White lies
Sitting inside
(???)
Hold me, there's too much tension
Degrade me
I'm fuckin' hungry
Feed me, I want some comfort
Consume me, I want my complex back
Cold naked man
Picked off his scabs
And fed them
To the pigeons
Help him, he's cornered
Kill him, you mercy mourner!
Life's a fuckin' resume
Experienced, credentials
Experienced, imposter
People preaching everyday
White lies, running inside
(???)
Hold me, no fucking rules
Just help me
I'm too pretentious
Please me, I'm really hungry
Degrade me, I want my complex back
