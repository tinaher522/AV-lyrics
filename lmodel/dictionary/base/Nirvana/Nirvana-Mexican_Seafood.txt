<song artist="Nirvana" title="Mexican_Seafood">
Oh, itchy flakes, it isn't through me
Till the jaw's in flames, it's entertaining
True, the fungus mold is my attraction
Oh, it's only a disinfection
Only hurts when I, it hurts when I pee
Only hurts when I, it hurts when I sleep
I vomit cum and diarrhea on the tiled floor like oatmeal pizza
Fill my toilet bowl of a cloudy puss
I feel my blood becoming chowder rust
Only hurts a night, it hurts when I pee
Only hurts a night, until I sleep
Roll into my bed which does consist of lice bugs and fleas and
and yellow mucus
Stained dirt, Vaseline, toe jam &amp; boogers
Stomach acid worms that dance in sugared slusdge
Mmmmm ...
