<song artist="Nirvana" title="Verse_Chorus_Verse">
Neither side is sacred, no one wants to win
Feeling so sedated, think I'll just give in
Taking medication 'till my stomach's full
Either side is sacred, growing in my home (Alt: Crawling in my hole)
Grass is greener, over here
You're the fog that keeps me clear
Reinventing, what would you do?
Take your time and I'll be true
You're the reason I feel pain
Feels so good to feel again
Neither side is sacred, no one wants to win
Feeling so sedated, but I can't give in
Even medication, 'till my stomach's full
Feeling so sedated, when I'm in my home
Grass is greener, over here
You're the fog that keeps me clear
Reinventing, what would you do?
Take your time and I'll be true
You're the reason I feel pain
Feels so good to feel again
Oh (x4)
Neither side is sacred, no one wants to win
Feeling so sedated, think I'll just give in
Taking medication 'till my stomach's full
Feeling so sedated, when I'm in my home
Grass is greener, over here
You're the fog that keeps me clear
Reinventing, what would you do?
Learn from history, and I'll be true
You're the reason I feel pain
Feels so good to feel again
Oh ...
