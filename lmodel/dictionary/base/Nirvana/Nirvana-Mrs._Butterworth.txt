<song artist="Nirvana" title="Mrs._Butterworth">
Your life is shit (shit)
Your life is bogus (bull)
Your life is crime (crime)
Your life is hell (hell)
I'm gonna die, start a new union (Alt: but not before you do)
I'm gonna die, with my libido
I'm gonna die, start a new union (Alt: but not before you do)
I'm gonna die, don't fuck with me
Your life is shit (shit)
Your life is clean (it is clean)
Your life is lame, it's not so funny
Your life is stale (frail, frail!)
I'm gonna die, start a new union (Alt: but not before you do)
I'm gonna hell on my libido
I'm gonna die, start a new union (Alt: but not before you do)
I'm gonna hell on my libido
I'm gonna die, start a new union (Alt: but not before you do)
I'm gonna hell on my libido
I'm gonna die, start a new union (Alt: but not before you do)
I'm gonna die, watch the pain!
Your life is shit.
"I'm gonna open up myself a flea market
I'm gonna open up myself a flea market
And you're gonna wish that you did
And retire on the profits
First off,
I'm gonna empty out all of my Mrs. Butterworth jars
And I'm gonna put 'em on a shelf with my 800 dollar a month tax free Century 21 
shop
And then I am going to put my Mrs. Butterworth syrup jars on the shelf
Next to all the commemorative fast food chain glasses and cups I've accumulated 
over the past 62 years
Then I'm going to get some plywood
I'm going to get some plywood and cut them up into two by two feet squares
Then I'm going to get some burlap and I'm going to cut them into 
two by two feet squares, and then I'm going to put them onto the 
pieces of plywood
And then I'm going to go to the beach
I'm going to go to the beach and I'm gonna collect some 
shells and driftwood
And then I'm going to take the shells and driftwood and glue them 
onto the plywood and burlap
And sell 'em for lots of money
People will be paying top dollar for my kids new used new 
toys and clothing 
Then maybe someday I can get rid of that 
pissed-stained matress I've been sleeping on"
I'm gonna die, start a new union (Alt: but not before you do)
I'm gonna hell on my libido
I'm gonna die, start a new union (Alt: but not before you do)
I'm gonna die on my libido
I'm gonna die, start a new union (Alt: but not before you do)
I'm gonna die on my libido
I'm gonna die, start a new union (Alt: but not before you do)
I'm gonna die watch the pain
