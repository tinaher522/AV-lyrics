<song artist="Nirvana" title="Nobody_Knows_I'm_New_Wave">
I could, I can shit anywhere
And I promised a girl I would shit on the stage
Oh that sound and falling no
I chose to shit anywhere
And I promise to shit on your head
(cannot make out next 3 lines)
God I shit I'll shit anywhere
And I go when I chose to 
trained on your face
Right and god oh god I'll wipe my helmet
Want my safe
I'm new wave
I'm new wave
I'm new wave
Ahh I'm new wave
I'm new wave
I'm new wave
I'm old school
I'm old school
I'm new wave and not straight
I'm new wave (mumbling)
