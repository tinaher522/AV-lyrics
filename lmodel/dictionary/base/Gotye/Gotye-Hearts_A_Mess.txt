<song artist="Gotye" title="Hearts_A_Mess">
Pick apart,
The pieces of your heart,
And let me peer inside.
Let me in,
Where only your thoughts have been.
Let me occupy your mind,
As you do mine.
You have lost (too much love)
To fear, doubt and distrust
(It's not enough)
You just threw away the key
To your heart
You don't get burned
('Cause nothing gets through)
It makes it easier
(Easier on you)
But that much more difficult for me
To make you seeâ€¦
Love ain't fair
So there you are
My love
Your heart's a mess.
You won't admit to it.
It makes no sense,
But I'm desperate to connect.
And you can't live like this.
Your heart's a mess.
You won't admit to it.
It makes no sense,
But I'm desperate to connect.
And you, 
You can't live like this.
Your heart's a mess.
You won't admit to it.
It makes no sense,
But I'm desperate to connect.
And you can't live like this.
Love ain't safe.
You won't get hurt if you stay chaste.
So, you can wait,
But I don't wanna waste... 
...my love.
