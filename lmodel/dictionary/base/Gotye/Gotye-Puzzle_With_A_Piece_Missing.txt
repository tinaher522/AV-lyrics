<song artist="Gotye" title="Puzzle_With_A_Piece_Missing">
Tiny pieces come to me every day
Still I wait
Things are falling into place
But so much time goes to waste
I stretch and shift
These parts won't fit
I can chop and change all I like
Rearranging this won't make it right
All doors are open.
All the doors are open.
