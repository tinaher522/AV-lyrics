<song artist="Gotye" title="Here_In_This_Place">
Here in this place
The stars will protect us with their celestial embrace
Here in this place
The slow wind sings gently to the rolling waves
I touch your face
And we leave conscious thought for the freedom of this drug-like daze
And I heard you say
Let's lose ourselves out here always
Lost in this haze
This prison of pleasures from which we want no escape
Cos here in this place
Our night's filled with passion and so are our days
I heard the moon say
To the sky, why do we bother with a timetable?
When it's clear as the rain
We're lovers forever, together we'll always stay
Here in this place
See the clouds begin to form
Feel that cold wind start to blow
Here comes the storm
