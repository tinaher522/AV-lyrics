<song artist="Gotye" title="What_Do_You_Want?">
What do you want?
What do you want from us?
To ask you this much is just a matter of trust
Not an affront
What do you want?
Few here'd be true to your point of view
If they knew
What you want
Who here would choose
To walk in those shoes
Even you can't
So what do you want?
What do you want from us?
What do you want
What do you want that you cannot say
Show us the faith we're supposed to display
Come what mayâ¦
You can't!
So what do you want?
What do you want from us?
It's a matter of trust
That you tell us just
What you want from us
