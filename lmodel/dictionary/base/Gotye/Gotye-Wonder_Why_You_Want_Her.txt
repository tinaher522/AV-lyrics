<song artist="Gotye" title="Wonder_Why_You_Want_Her">
Lost
In her face,
Caught
On the thought of a taste,
Sold
On the fantasy,
Bought,
For a price you can have a piece
Fresh
From the colour press,
The flesh
Of today's princess,
Spread
From end to end,
Blue eyes
And perfect skin
Invite everyone in.
Do you ever wonder why you want her?
Does it even matter you can't have her?
Even if you tried to it wouldn't satisfy you
Trying to possess her can only depress you
Do you ever wonder why you want her?
Does it even matter you could never have her?
Even if you tried to it would never satisfy you
You'll only want her stronger,
Long for longer
