<song artist="Gotye" title="The_Only_Way">
Calm down now baby
The end of the journey's in sight
You've travelled so far love
Now all of the stars are aligned
Say goodbye (I don't want to)
Don't you fight (I don't want to)
Leaving your life's no easy ride
All the grief you gave
All the love you made
All your yesterdays
Everything you were
Will fade
This is the only way
All the things you thought
you came here for
Everything you thought
you knew for sure
No meandering
No more wondering
Everything is true
All the things you thought you had to say
Everyone you left along the way
So you gather how
Nothing matters now that your time is through
This is the only way
