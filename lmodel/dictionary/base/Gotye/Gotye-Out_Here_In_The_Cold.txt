<song artist="Gotye" title="Out_Here_In_The_Cold">
Darlin' don't leave me out here in the cold
I'm begging you baby don't leave me out here on my own
I'll die,
If you don't hold me tight
Tonight,
I couldn't make it outside
If I tried,
So please let me in lover,
Be kind
Darlin' don't desert me in here it's so dark
Don't leave me here darlin' don't you know I can't stand to part
Oh but I'll stay,
If you promise to keep me safe,
I can't make it alone,
I'm afraid,
Oh my angel just don't go away
Please, don't leave me out here in the cold
No, no please don't leave me out here on my own
