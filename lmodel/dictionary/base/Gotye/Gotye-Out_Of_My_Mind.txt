<song artist="Gotye" title="Out_Of_My_Mind">
You loved me yesterday
But said that you just couldn't stay
Now I can't get you out of my head
So many signs float by
But only you are signified
And I just can't get you out of my head
I can't get it right
I can't get you out of my mind
I can't get it right
I just can't get you out of my mind
Lately I'm concerned
These dark obsessions make me toss and turn
And I can't be unwound
Now you're not around
Dreams of you are all that hold me down
I can't get it right
I can't get you out of my mind
I can't get it right
I just can't get you out of my mind
