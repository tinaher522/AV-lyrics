<song artist="Gotye" title="Loath_To_Refuse">
If you don't want me now
Then you can't have me later
âCause I won't wait for you
So don't expect me to
If you won't love me now
Then we'll be nothing after
So you had better stay
Lest I take my love away
You don't want to lose me
But you're loath to refuse me
And I know that you'll always choose me
Over anybody else
If you won't leave me now
You won't see me later
Leave me on my own
I need to be alone now
And though you want me now
You can wait 'till after
âCause patience is a virtue my love
The question is âdo you have enough'?
