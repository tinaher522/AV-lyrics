<song artist="Elton_John" title="Conquistador">
Every fable you've ever sown
In every building you've ever owned
Any chance to cheat or beat the clock
With every oil slick sticking to the rocks
What you see is what you get
Manhattan skyline, a California sunset
Truth decay and the breadline poor
But honey's what the bees
Make conquistador
Conquistador
Whatta ya fighting for?
Whatta ya want from life?
You've got such
An appetite for more
They laid down the Incas
You lay down the law
So hungry for more
Like conquistadors
Whatta ya fighting for?
Only the lonely big leather chair
Holds it's position year after year
With every wave on every shore
You wash away your sins
Like conquistadors
Conquistador
Whatta ya fighting for?
Whatta ya want from life?
You've got such
An appetite for more
They laid down the Incas
You lay down the law
So hungry for more
Like Conquistadors
Oh they laid down the Incas
You lay down the law
So hungry for more
Like conquistadors
Whatta ya fighting for
So where's the party
Your sense of humor
Rumors on Wall Street
They're diggin' up
Montezuma
