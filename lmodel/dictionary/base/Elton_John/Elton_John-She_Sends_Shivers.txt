<song artist="Elton_John" title="She_Sends_Shivers">
Like a short walk on a razor's edge
Like a warm body in a cold, cold bed
Like a strong drink you go to my head
She sends shivers through me
Why talk when it's all been said
Your heart's so blue
But your blood's so red
Can't you bury the past
Along with the dead
Oh, like a knife made of ice
So deep I could freeze
She sends shivers through me
All down my spine
From my head to my heals
She sends
She sends shivers through me
Like sweat runs on a hot hot face
Like the devil dancing in your fireplace
Like a bullet hole shot through a red ace
You send shivers through me
Words get strangled in a wire noose
Tempers flare up
On a short short fuse
We got nothing to gain and everything to lose
Oh, like a knife made of ice
So deep I could freeze
All down my spine
From my head to my heals
She sends shivers through me
Like a bite white hot
I could bleed
She sends shivers through me
On my pale pink cheek
Leave the mark of your teeth
She sends
She send shivers through me
And I'm willing to pay the cost
Our souls are already lost
You grab the stake
I'll grab the cross
She sends shivers through me
Like a knife made of ice
She sends shivers through me
All down my spine
From my head to my heals
She sends shivers through me
Like a bite white hot
I could bleed
She sends shivers through me
On my pale pink cheek
Leave the mark of your teeth
She sends
She sends shivers through me
