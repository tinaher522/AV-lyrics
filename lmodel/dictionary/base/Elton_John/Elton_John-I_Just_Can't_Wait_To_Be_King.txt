<song artist="Elton_John" title="I_Just_Can't_Wait_To_Be_King">
Way behind the water hole
A little down the line
The jungle and the plains and peaks
Are scheduled to be mine
 
I'm gonna be the ruler
Of most everything around
From the grandest of the mountains
To the humble common ground
 
My reign will be a super awesome thing
Oh, I just can't wait to be king
 
I'm gonna be a noble king
And scrupulously fair
I only need a little time
Perhaps a little hair
 
I'm gonna be the mane event
Like no king was before
I'm brushing up on looking down
I'm working on my roar
 
The fauna and the flora gonna swing
Oh, I just can't wait to be king
 
No one saying do this
No one saying be there
No one saying stop that
No one saying see here
Free to run around all day
I'll be free to do it my way
 
No one saying do this
No one saying be there
No one saying stop that
No one saying see here
Free to run around all day
Free to do it my way
 
The time has come as someone said
To talk of many things
May be true
But I would rather stick to talking kings
 
It's easy to be royal
If you're already leonine
It isn't just my right
Even my left will be divine
 
The monarchy is waiting to go zing
Oh, I just can't wait to be king
Oh, I just can't wait to be king
