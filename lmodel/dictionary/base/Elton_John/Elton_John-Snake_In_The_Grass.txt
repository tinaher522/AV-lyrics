<song artist="Elton_John" title="Snake_In_The_Grass">
Beautiful morning, ahh
Down by the river, ahh
Without a warning, ahh
Who'd ever guess you'd come across a snake in the grass
Every day now, ahh
You take a walk here, ahh
What do you say now, ahh
If you should meet an evil-minded snake in the grass
Stop and watch where you're putting your feet, my sweet
I don't want to do anything bad
But you make me mad and I might bite your face, bite neck, bite arms, bite bite
'Cause I'm, oh, a snake in the grass, oh
A snake in the grass
Looking around you, ahh
You never see me, ahh
You'll get a surprise, ahh
Should you get entangled with a snake in the grass
Under my thick skin, ahh
I can be lonely, ahh
Please can I come in, ahh
And end my sad existence as a snake in the grass
Under my thick skin, ahh
I can be lonely, ahh
Please can I come in, ahh
And end my sad existence as a snake in the grass
Stop and watch where you're putting your feet, my sweet
I don't want to do anything bad
But you make me mad and I might bite your face, bite neck, bite arms, bite bite
'Cause I'm, oh, a snake in the grass, oh
A snake in the grass
