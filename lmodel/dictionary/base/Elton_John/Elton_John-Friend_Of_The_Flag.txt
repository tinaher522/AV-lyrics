<song artist="Elton_John" title="Friend_Of_The_Flag">
There's people livin' in fear of a sickle and hammer
I was born for the ensign, now I wave that Yankee banner
Pride ain't so ugly, hate ain't so young
And it ain't so far, this country's come
But I'm a friend of the flag, I hope you understand
I'm a pilgrim on the water, all the way from England
The tall ships sail on through Into the harbor
Dark skins on the deck
But the immigrant, he works hard here
Race ain't a color, white ain't the world
But I still love my American girl
I'm a friend of the flag, I hope you understand
I'm a pilgrim on the water, all the way from England
And I married Miss America and gave her all I had
I'm a born again American, a friend of the flag
And you paid the price, the day you hunted buffalo
And you've just begun to tell us what the Hopi told us long ago
Peace in the heart shelters your life
No roof over doubt when the spirit flies
I'm a friend of the flag, I hope you understand
I'm a pilgrim on the water, all the way from England
And I married Miss America and gave her all I had
I'm a born again American, a friend of the flag
Hold on, sail on, friend of the flag
Hold on, sail on, friend of the flag
