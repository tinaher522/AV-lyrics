<song artist="Elton_John" title="New_Lone_Ranger">
Do we need a new Lone Ranger
Fighting on our side?
Are we looking for a stranger
To give us one last ride?
I heard them say the strip is dying
She's calling it murder one
No minor crime, television stars
Falling from the sky
We have lived exciting lives
We're looking for a change
A chance to play the game
Do you miss the singing cowboy?
Will Hollywood ride again?
Are we looking for a stranger
For one last ride?
Do we want a new Lone Ranger
Fighting on our side?
If we need a second coming
To deal with danger
There's a shakedown or a showdown
For a new Lone Ranger
Only ghosts go walking on the wire
So don't cry, baby, it's only gunfire
One hundred horses on a freeway west
Heading for the desert escaping death
Looking for a rerun
Of a long forgotten son
Do you think about the masked man
Or how the West was won?
Are we looking for a stranger
For one last ride?
Do we want a new Lone Ranger
Fighting on our side?
If we need a second coming
To deal with danger
There's a shakedown or a showdown
For a new Lone Ranger
How the West was won
(Walk on the wire)
This is, is how the West was won
(Walk on the wire)
How the West was won
We're looking for a change
A chance to play the game
Do you miss the singing cowboy?
Will Hollywood ride again?
Are we looking for a stranger
For one last ride?
Do we want a new Lone Ranger
Fighting on our side?
If we need a second coming
To deal with danger?
There's a shakedown or a showdown
For a new Lone Ranger?
Do we need a new Lone Ranger
Fighting on our side?
A hundred horses heading for the West
Are we looking for a stranger
To give us one last ride?
There's a shakedown or a showdown
For a New Lone Ranger
Do we need a new Lone Ranger
Fighting on our side?
Are we looking for a stranger
To give us one last ride?
