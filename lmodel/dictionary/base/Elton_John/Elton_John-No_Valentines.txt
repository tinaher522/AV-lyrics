<song artist="Elton_John" title="No_Valentines">
No more Valentine's Day
No more Christmas Cards
I've thrown 'em all away
No more sequined stars
No birthday wishes
No more surprises
Who needs 'em anyway
No reason to get excited
Yes, I gave you everything
I gave you earth and sky
And everything in between
That walks, crawls or flies
No Easter mornings
It's your cross now
Keep it all for yourself
It's overrated anyhow
But keep my Valentine
I'll keep my bleeding heart
Just let me out of here
Before that sentimental music starts
And your regrets
Fall like empty lines
Like the lies we write on Valentines
But keep my Valentine
I'll keep my bleeding heart
Just let me out of here
Before that sentimental music starts
And your regrets
Fall like empty lines
Like the lies we write on Valentines
I'll keep my bleeding heart
Just let me out of here
Before that sentimental music starts
And your regrets
Fall like empty lines
Like the lies we write on Valentines
