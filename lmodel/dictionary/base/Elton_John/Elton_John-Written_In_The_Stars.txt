Aida:
I am here to tell you we can never meet again 
Simple really, isn't it, a word or two and then 
A lifetime of not knowing where or how or why or when
You think of me or speak of me and wonder what befell 
The someone you once loved so long ago so well 
Radames:
Never wonder what I'll feel as living shuffles by 
You don't have to ask me and I need not reply 
Every moment of my life from now until I die 
I will think or dream of you and fail to understand 
How a perfect love can be confounded out of hand 
Aida &amp; Radames:
Is it written in the stars 
Are we paying for some crime 
Is that all that we are good for 
Just a stretch of mortal time 
It's this God's experiment 
In which we have no say 
In which we're given paradise 
But only for a day 
Aida:
Nothing can be altered, there is nothing to decide 
No escape, no change of heart, no anyplace to hide 
Radames:
You are all I'll ever want, but this I am denied 
Sometimes in my darkest thoughts, I wish I'd never learned 
Aida &amp; Radames: 
What it is to be in love and have that love returned 
Aida &amp; Radames:
Is it written in the stars 
Are we paying for some crime 
Is that all that we are good for 
Just a stretch of mortal time 
It's This God's experiment 
In which we have no say 
In which we're given paradise 
But only for a day
Background:
Is it written in the stars 
Are we paying for some crime 
Is that all that we are good for 
Just a stretch of mortal time
Aida &amp; Radames:
It's This God's experiment 
In which we have no say 
In which we're given paradise 
But only for a day
