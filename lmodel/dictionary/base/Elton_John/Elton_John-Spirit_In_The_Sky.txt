<song artist="Elton_John" title="Spirit_In_The_Sky">
When I die and they lay me to rest 
Gonna go to the place that's best 
When they lay me down to die 
Goin on up to the Spirit in the sky 
Goin on up to the Spirit in the sky 
(Spirit in the sky) 
That's where I'm gonna go when I die 
(When I die) 
When I die and they lay me to rest 
I'm gonna go to the place that's the best 
Prepare yourself, you know it's a must 
Gotta have a friend named Jesus 
So you know that when you die 
It's gonna recommend you to the Spirit in the sky 
(Spirit in the sky) 
Goin on up to the Spirit in the sky 
That's where you're gonna go when you die 
(When you die) 
When I die and they lay me to rest 
I'm gonna go to the place that's the best 
Never been a sinner, I've never sinned 
I've got a friend named Jesus 
So you know that when I die 
It's gonna set me up with the Spirit in the sky 
Repeat Chorus (x2)
