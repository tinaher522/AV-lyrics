<song artist="Elton_John" title="Sartorial_Eloquence">
You've a certain sartorial eloquence
And a style that's almost all your own
You've got the knack of being so laid back...
It's like talking to the great unknown.
You've got a self-sufficient swept-back hair-do
Pretty certain that you've got it made...
Oh, your lifestyle shows in the clothes you chose
Sitting pretty in the masquerade...
Singing, don't you wanna play this game no more?
Don't you wanna play no more?
Don't you wanna play this game no more?
Don't you wanna play no more?
You remain the only main contender
Though you never, you never meant to lose at all.
Down and out, yet I'm surrounded...
Adamant before the fall.
Oh, when you go, you know
I might be lonesome
But I keep it under close control...
Go and get your kicks, and Babe,
Let's call it quits
I believe I'm feeling indisposed.
Singing, don't you wanna play this game no more?
Don't you wanna play no more?
Don't you wanna play this game no more?
Don't you wanna play no more?
Don't you wanna play this game?
Don't you wanna play this game?
Oh, when you go, you know I might be lonesome...
But I keep it under close control.
Go and get your kicks
And babe let's call it quits...
I believe I'm feeling indisposed.
Come on, sing it, don't you wanna play this game no more?
Don't you wanna play no more?
Don't you wanna play this game no more?
Don't you wanna play no more?
Don't you wanna play this game no more?
Don't you wanna play no more?
Don't you wanna play this game no more?
Don't you wanna play no more?
Don't you wanna play no more?
Don't you wanna play no more?
