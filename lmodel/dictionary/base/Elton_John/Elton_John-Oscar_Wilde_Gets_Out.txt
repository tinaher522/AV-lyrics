<song artist="Elton_John" title="Oscar_Wilde_Gets_Out">
Freedom for the scapegoat, let him rot in jail 
Gloomy eyes, just pissed his heart like crucifixion nails 
Shake his fists and raise his beam, he never stood a chance 
When the angry red mob on Fleet Street you turned your eyes to friends 
Humble thought from Dublin chased across the waves 
Your body still sharp enough to slice through every page 
Destitute and beaten by the system of the crown 
The bitter pill you swallowed take the sweet of going down 
And looking back with a great indifference
Looking back at the lime stone walls
Thinking how beauty deceived you
Knowing how the fools are fought 
A golden boy in velvet landed in New York 
The past was so seductive when they paid to hear you talk 
Baccarat and champagne flutes, tobacco from Virginia 
Long before the lords and Lord granted Oscar Wilde a sinner 
Looking back on a cold, bleak winter
Looking back on those long, dark days
Set like the head of Joan the Baptist 
In the other sour May 
Don't turn around if you watch out screaming 
Don't cry out loud, you never know who's listening 
'Cause dear Lord, the exiles aren't forgiven 
FromÂ ?? to a prison 
Looking back at the hard life
Looking back at the wretched war 
Taken back there for my savior 
Strange to think I'll miss them all 
Strange to thing I'll miss them all 
And looking back with a great indifference
Looking back at the lime stone walls
Thinking how beauty deceived you
Knowing how the fools are fought
