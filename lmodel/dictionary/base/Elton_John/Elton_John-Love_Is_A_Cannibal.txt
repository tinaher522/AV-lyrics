<song artist="Elton_John" title="Love_Is_A_Cannibal">
We follow the dog who follows the cat
We swallow the chain if they don't fight back
We come and go just gettin' by
We got a flag on the moon, we got a hole in the sky
And each man kills the things he loves
It's an edible romance we all dream of
And love eats love, eats love, love is a cannibal
Woman is a criminal, she have a hunger but man is the animal
And if love eats love, eats love, love is a cannibal
We live in the woods but we hate the trees
We kill off the jungle but we save the leaves
The family face is painted gray
They did it for the baby and the wedding day
And each man kills the things he loves
It's an edible romance we all dream of
And love eats love, eats love, love is a cannibal
Woman is a criminal, she have a hunger but man is the animal
And if love eats love, eats love, love is a cannibal
Each man kills the things he loves
It's an edible romance we all dream of
And love eats love, eats love, love is a cannibal
Woman is a criminal, she have a hunger but man is the animal
And if love eats love, eats love, love is a cannibal
Eats love, love is a cannibal
Woman is a criminal, she have a hunger, man is the animal
And love eats love, eats love, love is a cannibal
Love is, love is, love is a cannibal, love is, love is, love is a cannibal
Love is, love is, love is a cannibal, love is, love is, love is a cannibal
Love is, love is, love is a cannibal, love is, love is, love is a cannibal
