<song artist="Elton_John" title="Snow_Queen">
You remind me so much
Of her when you're walking
Where everything's perfect
And nobody's talking
You're a cushion uncrumpled
You're a bed that's unruffled
The finest bone china,
Bone china around
And I believe that the snow queen
Lives somewhere in the hills
She's got the world on a string
Like white wine when it's chilled
Arms are spread like icicles
Upon a frosted cake
The snow queen reigns in warm L.A.
Behind the cold black gates
Your talents are tested
They're polished and they're shaped
Your talents are wasted
On men of no taste
But how about proving
That passion means more than
A wardrobe of gowns, TV ratings,
