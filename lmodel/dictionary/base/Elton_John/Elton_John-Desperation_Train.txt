<song artist="Elton_John" title="Desperation_Train">
Thereabouts I came across
Another empty hand
Another tin cup
Shaken by some raggedy old man
Acting blind and keeping time
With his thin white cane
He said that Jesus Christ and Judas
Rode the desperation train
I've been torn down
And rebuilt again
Felt the cold fire of madness
As it ran through my veins
Signals from the green flag
Steam rising in the front cab
I believe we'd left it all behind
On the desperation train
They came
All the king's horses
And all the king's men
For all those who ride
Won't be denied
For we all have rode
The desperation train
Into view the ice truck flew
With a smiling man aboard
All pink cheeks and flashing teeth
In a bright white uniform
He said this laugh is just a mask
It helps to take the strain
But Charlie Chaplin and Lou Costello
Rode the desperation train
And I've played hard
And waited in vain
Seen the red sun of sadness
Slowly sinking in my brain
I've been driving in the long spikes
Laying rails in the cold night
I believe we'd left it all behind
On the desperation train
They came
All the king's horses
And all the king's men
For all those who feel
Fate turns the wheel
Of the last car home
On the desperation rain
We've all been there
Been born too late
From Joan Of Arc
To Norma Rae
Men without shame, we came
The last on this line
And freed from our chains
For all those who chose
The road leading home
We'll never put them back
Together again
For all those who ride
They won't be denied
For we all have rode
The desperation train
