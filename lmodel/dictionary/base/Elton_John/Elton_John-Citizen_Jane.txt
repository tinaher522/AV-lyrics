<song artist="Elton_John" title="Citizen_Jane">
Oh, the press is down
And the flesh is black and white
Eager workers turning the pages
Dirty fingers touch your life
All you pretty maids
With all your charms on view
Farm the waste ground in your head now
Your sisters can't get through
Oh, hey, hey, Citizen Jane
What will your sisters say?
Oh, they'll say ain't it a shame
After comin' such a long, long way
Citizen Jane
Now they're trading skin
And the cause is pushed away
Greedy piggies live on Fleet Street
Dealing meat out every day
Oh, hey, hey, Citizen Jane
What will your sisters say?
Oh, they'll say ain't it a shame
After comin' such a long, long way
Citizen Jane
What a picture, what a woman
What a curve on the great white way
A little touch up, a little airbrush
What will your sisters say?
