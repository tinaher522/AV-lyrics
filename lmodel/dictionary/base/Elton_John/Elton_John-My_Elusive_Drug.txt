<song artist="Elton_John" title="My_Elusive_Drug">
I'm not the same as I used to be
All the things you've heard seem hard to believe
Haven't always been good, never really been bad
Most times I've been happy, yeah
Sometimes I've been sad
Sure I've made mistakes, haven't we all
I've been loose as a cannon and dumb as a wall
Haven't always been sober
In counting my ducks
And if I look back now
I've had my share of luck
But the change didn't come over night, I've been searching for you all my life
All the habits that I couldn't handle, I've swept them under the rug
In exchange for the sweetest addiction
You, my elusive drug
I'm going to stay now, I really like it here
I may paint your picture
And I might grow a beard
There were times I was crazy
Couldn't handle my life
Don't think you'd have liked me
Not at any old price
But the change didn't come over night, I've been searching for you all my life
All the habits that I couldn't handle, I've swept them under the rug
In exchange for the sweetest addiction
You, my elusive drug
And I've taken the pills
I got burnt out and chilled by the cold
But I've no regrets and that being said
You know cheap thrills can get pretty old (Ah, ah!)
But the change didn't come over night, I've been searching for you all my life
All the habits that I couldn't handle, I've swept them under the rug
In exchange for the sweetest addiction
You, my elusive drug
But the change didn't come over night, I've been searching for you all my life
All the habits that I couldn't handle, I've swept them under the rug
In exchange for the sweetest addiction
You, my elusive drug
In exchange for the sweetest addiction
You, my elusive drug
