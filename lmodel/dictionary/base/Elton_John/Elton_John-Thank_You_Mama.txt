<song artist="Elton_John" title="Thank_You_Mama">
Now the world has turned away
My life gets colder every day
You don't know how it is
I lost all my will to live
You've taken the love I have to give
You don't know how it is
You've taken the love I have to give
You don't know how it is
Thank you Mama, you ease to please again
You know Mama, you take the pain away
Oh it's sad but not so bad
Make me lose the blues I had
Thank you Mama, you ease to please again
Well Sunday comes along with the wind
Every Sunday was spent with him
You don't know how it is
We would watch the flames burn higher
Tell me Mama started to cry
You don't know how it is
Thank you Mama, you ease to please again
You know Mama, you take the pain away
Oh it's sad but not so bad
Make me lose the blues I had
Thank you Mama, you ease to please again
Thank you Mama, you ease to please again
You know Mama, you take the pain away
Oh it's sad but not so bad
Make me lose the blues I had
Thank you Mama, you ease to please again
You see my honesty was wrong
'Cause you've known me for so long
Oh you know how it is
Lost and won on down the line
And you always stood behind
Oh you know how it is
