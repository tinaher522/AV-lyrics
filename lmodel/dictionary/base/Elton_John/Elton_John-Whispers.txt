<song artist="Elton_John" title="Whispers">
Look at me twice with wildcat eyes
Promise me everything
Except a blue night
Shudder like ice in cut crystal glass
Melt in embraces
Of crazy eyed past
And whisper, whisper, whispering whispers
Tantamount to a lie with lingering breath
Walking fingers run
Hungry scratches left
Dull chimes ringing like an empty voice
A distant smile framed
Her lips are soft and moist
With whisper, whisper, whispering whispers
And whisper in a rhythm your lies
Keep comfort for others
Hurt me with the night
Whisper like cold winds
Close to the bone
Save heaven for lovers
Leave me alone
With your whisper, whisper, whispering whispers
Whisper, whisper, whispering whispers
Whisper in rhythm your lies
Keep comfort for others
Hurt me with the night
Whisper like cold winds
Close to the bone
Save heaven for lovers
Leave me alone
With your whisper, whisper, whisperin'
Whisper in a rhythm your lies
Keep comfort for others
Hurt me with the night
Whisper like cold winds
Close to the bone
Save heaven for lovers
Leave me alone
With your whisper, whisper, whispering whispers
With your whispers
With your whispers
Oh oh oh
Whispering whispers
