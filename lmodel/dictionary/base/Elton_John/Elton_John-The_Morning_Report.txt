<song artist="Elton_John" title="The_Morning_Report">
Zazu
It's an honor and a privilege, a duty I perform
With due sense of decorum and with pride
With deference and great respect very much the norm
Plus a hint of sycophancy on the side
To lay before my ruler all the facts about his realm
To fill him in on all the beastly news
Mufasa
Yes, yes, Zazu, get on with it!
Zazu
In order that His Majesty stands sturdy at the helm
Aware of all the fauna's latest views
Mufasa
Zazu! The morning report!
Zazu
Yes, Sireâ€”the morning report...
Chimps are going ape, giraffes remain above it all
Elephants remember, though just what I can't recall
Crocodiles are snapping up fresh offers from the banks
Showed interest in my nest egg but I quickly said "No thanks!"
We haven't paid the hornbills and the vultures have a hunch
Not everyone invited will be coming back from lunch
This is the morning report
Gives you the long and the short
Every grunt, roar, and snort
Not a tale I distort
On the morning report
Mufasa
What are you doing, son?
Simba
Pouncing!
Mufasa
Let and old pro show you how it's done...
The buffalo have got a beef about this season's grass (Mufasa: Stay low to the ground)
Warthogs have been thwarted in attempts to save their gas
Flamingos in the pink and chasing secretary birds (Simba: Yeah, stay low!)
Saffron is this season's color, seen in all the herds (Mufasa: Shh, not a sound)
Moving down the rank and file to near the bottom rung (Mufasa: Take it slow, one more step)
Far too many beetles are quite frankly in the dung (Mufasa: Then pounce!)
Aaaaaak! (Mufasa: Haa!)
Simba
This is the morning report
Gives you the long and the short
Every grunt, roar, and snort
Not a tale I distort
On the morning report
All
This is the morning report
Gives you the long and the short
Every grunt, roar, and snort
Not a tale I distort
On the morning report
