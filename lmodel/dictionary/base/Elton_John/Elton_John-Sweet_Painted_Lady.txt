<song artist="Elton_John" title="Sweet_Painted_Lady">
I'm back on dry land once again
Opportunity awaits me like a rat in a drain,
We're all hunting honey with money to burn
Just a short time to show you the tricks that we've learned.
If the boys all behave themselves here
Well there's pretty young ladies and beer in the rear,
You won't need a gutter to sleep in tonight
The prices I charge here will see you alright.
So she lays down beside me again
My sweet painted lady, the one with no name,
Many have used her and many still do
There's a place in the world for a woman like you.
Oh! Sweet painted lady
Seems it's always been the same,
Getting paid for being laid
Guess that's the name of the game.
Oh! Sweet painted lady
Seems it's always been the same,
Getting paid for being laid
Guess that's the name of the game. Oh!
Forget us we'll have gone very soon
Just forget we ever slept in your rooms,
And we'll leave the smell of the sea in your beds
Where love's just a job and nothing is said.
So she lays down beside me again
My sweet painted lady, the one with no name,
Many have used her and many still do
There's a place in the world for a woman like you.
Oh! Sweet painted lady
Seems it's always been the same,
Getting paid for being laid
Guess that's the name of the game.
Oh! Sweet painted lady
Seems it's always been the same,
Getting paid for being laid
Guess that's the name of the game. Oh!
