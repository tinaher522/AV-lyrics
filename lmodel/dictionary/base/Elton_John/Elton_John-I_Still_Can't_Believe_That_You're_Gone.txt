<song artist="Elton_John" title="I_Still_Can't_Believe_That_You're_Gone">
In the mirror I see guilt
In your shoes I see myself
But I still can't believe that you're gone
In the dust of an 8 x 10
I can still caress your frame
But I still can't believe that you're gone
Oh, I just can't believe
That you'd do this to me
No, I just can't believe that you're gone
What am I supposed to do
One is not as fun as two
No, I still can't believe that you're gone, no
I still can't believe that you're gone
In your cup I drink your health
On the phone
I still can't believe that you're gone
And in a pinch I hold your things
And brush them up against my skin
'Cause I still can't believe that you're gone
Oh, I just can't believe
That you'd do this to me
No, I just can't believe that you're gone
What am I supposed to do
One is not as fun as two
No I still can't believe that you're gone
I still can't believe that you're gone
And it used to be just like heaven
Living hand, hand in glove
Used to be that you and I
Were building on the property of love
Oh, I just can't believe
That you'd do this to me
No, I just can't believe that you're gone
What am I supposed to do
One is not as fun as two
No, I still can't believe that you're gone
I still can't believe that you're gone
