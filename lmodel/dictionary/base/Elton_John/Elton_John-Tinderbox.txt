<song artist="Elton_John" title="Tinderbox">
Nostradamus said "I predict
That the world will end at half past six"
What he didn't say was exactly when
Was he listening to the radio?
Was he listening to the government?
Well he got us spooked anyway
We'd been running hot up until today
But a wind of change blew across our sails
We were coasting on a winning streak
We were kings until the power failed
(We've been living in a tinderbox)
(And two sparks can set the whole thing off)
(Rubbing up together around the clock)
(Lately we've been getting more roll than rock)
(You and me together in a tinderbox)
(And two sparks can set the whole thing off)
(Rubbing up together around the clock)
(Lately we've been getting more roll than rock)
Godzilla came in disguise
Tore the building down right before our eyes
Kept the needle out of the red balloon
Was he worried we might go too far
Maybe wind up rhyming moon and June
The sun descends down in Mexico
While a fancy car back on Savile Row
Shows the price of fame leads to overkill
Things are gonna have to change
Some holes along the road get filled
(We've been living in a tinderbox)
(And two sparks can set the whole thing off)
(Rubbing up together around the clock)
(Lately we've been getting more roll than rock)
(You and me together in a tinderbox)
(And two sparks can set the whole thing off)
(Rubbing up together around the clock)
(Lately we've been getting more roll than rock)
Pressure's gonna cook us if we don't unlock it
Guns going off if we don't uncock it
We've gotta climb out of the other one's pocket
Or we're gonna burn, out on this beautiful rocket
(We've been living in a tinderbox)
(And two sparks can set the whole thing off)
(Rubbing up together around the clock)
(Lately we've been getting more roll than rock)
(You and me together in a tinderbox)
(And two sparks can set the whole thing off)
(Rubbing up together around the clock)
(Lately we've been getting more roll than rock)
(You and me together in a tinderbox)
(And two sparks can set the whole thing off)
(Rubbing up together around the clock)
(Lately we've been getting more roll than rock)
(You and me together in a tinderbox)
(And two sparks can set the whole thing off)
(Rubbing up together around the clock)
(Lately we've been getting more roll than rock)
