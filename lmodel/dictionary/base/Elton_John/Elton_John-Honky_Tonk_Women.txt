<song artist="Elton_John" title="Honky_Tonk_Women">
She's a honky tonk women 
Give me, give me, give me the honky tonk blues. 
I met a gin soaked, bar-room queen in Memphis, 
She tried to take me upstairs for a ride. 
She tried to heave me right across her shoulder 
And I just can't seem to drink you off my mind. 
She's a honky tonk women 
Give me, give me, give me the honky tonk blues. 
 
I laid a divorcee here in New York City, 
I had to put up some kind of a fight. 
The lady then she covered me in roses, 
She blew my nose and then she blew my mind. 
She's a honky tonk women 
Give me, give me, give me the honky tonk blues. 
 
She's a honky tonk women 
Give me, give me, give me the honky tonk blues.
