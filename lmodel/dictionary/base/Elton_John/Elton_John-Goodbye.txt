<song artist="Elton_John" title="Goodbye">
And now that it's all over
The birds can nest again
I'll only snow when the sun comes out
I'll shine
Only when it starts to rain
And if you want a drink
Just squeeze my hand
And wine will flow into the lands
and feed my lambs...
For I am the mirror
I can reflect the moon
I will write songs for you
I'll be 
Your silver spoon
I'm sorry
I took your time 
I am the poem that doesn't rhyme
Just turn back a page
I'll waste away
I'll waste away
I'll waste away
I'll waste away
I'll waste away
I'll waste away....
