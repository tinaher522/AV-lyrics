<song artist="Elton_John" title="She_Sold_Me_Magic">
Maybe, you're always maybe, 
Maybe, maybe I love you 
My thanks jaunty for the lower time
Maybe, you're always maybe, 
Maybe, maybe I love you
But I keep follow something other side.
She sold me magic
She sold me magic
And all the believer things I needed every day
She sold me magic
She sold me magic
And all the believer things I needed every day.
Maybe, you're always maybe, maybe, maybe I love you
My thanks jaunty for the lower time
Maybe, you're always maybe, maybe, maybe I love you
But I keep follow something other side.
She sold me magic
She sold me magic
And all the believer things I needed every day
She sold me magic
She sold me magic
And all the believer things I needed every day.
She said I'm in my better life time
She said my soul is matching her a sign
She turn mine in all about she loves me strong
Will you love me love? She push me all again your love
Will you love me love? She push me all again your love.
Maybe, you're always maybe, maybe, maybe I love you
My thanks jaunty for the lower time
Maybe, you're always maybe, maybe, maybe I love you
But I keep follow something other side
