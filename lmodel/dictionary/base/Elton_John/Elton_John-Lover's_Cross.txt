<song artist="Elton_John" title="Lover's_Cross">
You were my night light in the jungle when the vulture came to call
You swam around below me and you dragged me up for air
Till all around the sounds of love came blowing through my door
You stayed awhile and like a child you stepped on all my toys
True love makes you bitter, true love turns you sour
But some time true love hits you in the strangest hours
I don't want to hang on no lover's cross for you
I won't be your crucifix or savior to bruise
I don't want to hang on no lover's cross for you
Saints alive I've died a hundred times or more for you
Prowling through my lifestyle, like a black cat on the roof
Riding astride my innocence when I was a hundred proof
And of our passion you confessed you'd never felt so proud
For what I lack, and my mistakes you'll find in others now
You can tell them that they're better, hand 'em the same line
But for Christ's sake I don't think you'll find someone that kind
Don't leave your shadow, won't you take it away
Don't want to keep finding little bits of you that stayed
If I see you tomorrow, if I spot you in a crowd
Be kind enough to ask me "Hey, how are you doing now"
"I'm doing fine, hope you're the same way"
Then I'll turn towards your latest love and say
Are you gonna hang on a lover's cross for her
Will you be her crucifix, do you mind getting hurt
Are you gonna hang on a lover's cross for her
Cause saints alive, I've died a hundred times or more for her
