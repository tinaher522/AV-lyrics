<song artist="Elton_John" title="Saint">
You don't pass your time in limbo
Or hang out with the crowd
Sitting on the stoop like a little girl
Who took the wrong road into town
But you got that short cut way about you
And no-one's gonna stare you down
You cook much better on a lower flame
You burn much better when the sun goes down
And heaven can't wait
But you ought to be a saint
I got your very best intentions
Helping me along
And if I ever fail to mention 
You were an overnight sensation
Well take it from me,
My baby's a saint 
My baby's a saint
I believe you were a new arrival
On the fast train passing through
And you traded in 
Your luck for survival
To sweeten up the witches brew
You had a better way of working magic
A little mistery in your eyes
Instead of rolling over
You remained the same
You took the whole world by surprise
And heaven can't wait 
But you ought to be a saint
I got your very best intentions
Helping me along
And if I ever fail to mention
You were an overnight sensation
Well take it from me 
My baby's a saint 
My baby's a saint
