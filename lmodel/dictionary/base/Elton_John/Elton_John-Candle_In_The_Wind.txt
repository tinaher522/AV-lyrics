<song artist="Elton_John" title="Candle_In_The_Wind">
Goodbye, Norma Jean
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
They crawled out of the woodwork
And they whispered into your brain
They set you on the treadmill
And they made you change your name
And it seems to me, you lived your life like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to when the rain set in
And I would have liked to know you, but I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before your legend ever did
Loneliness was tough
The toughest role you ever played
Hollywood created a superstar
And pain was the price you paid
Even when you died
All the press still hounded you
All the papers had to say
Was that Marilyn was found in the nude
And it seems to me, you lived your life like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to when the rain set in
And I would have liked to know you, but I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before your legend ever did
Goodbye, Norma Jean
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
Goodbye, Norma Jean
From the young man in the twenty-second row
Who sees you as something more than sexual
More than just our Marilyn Monroe
And it seems to me, you lived your life like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to when the rain set in
And I would have liked to know you, but I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before your legend ever did
Your candle burned out long before your legend ever did
