<song artist="Elton_John" title="The_Letter_(Mum's_Letter)">
And I will have missed you growing,
And I'll have missed you crying
And I'll have missed you laugh.
Missed your stomping and your shouting,
I'll have missed telling you off,
But please Billy,
Know that I was always there.
I was with you through everything.
And please, Billy.
But please, Billy
know that I will always be
Proud to have known you
Proud that you were mine
Proud in everything
And you must promise me this, Billy
In everything you do
Always be yourself, Billy
And you always will be true
And Ill have missed you growing, 
I'll have missed you crying 
And I'll have missed you laugh.
Missed your stamping and your shooting,
I have missed telling you off,
But please, Billy,
know that I was always there.
I was with you through everything.
And please, Billy,
Know that I will always be.
Proud to have known you.
Love you forever.
Love you forever.
