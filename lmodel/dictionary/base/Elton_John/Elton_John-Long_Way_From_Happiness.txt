<song artist="Elton_John" title="Long_Way_From_Happiness">
I guess you're OK, you seem to feel better these days
I've know you for so long, I've seen your brightness go from blue to grey
You know that it's true, you can shake your head
But I can prove, I've seen things through your eyes, you think you win but in the end you lose
And there's no second guess, we take no second bets
Chances are we're long way from happiness
Don't cover up the road to love with words that can't express
The truth implies, you're high and dry, and you're a long way from happiness
I'm one step behind, looking out for you all the time
I put my faith in you, and steer you clear of love that leaves blind
And there's no second guess, we take no second bets
Chances are we're long way from happiness
Don't cover up the road to love with words that can't express
The truth implies, you're high and dry, and you're a long way from happiness
And there's no second guess, we take no second bets
Chances are we're long way from happiness
Don't cover up the road to love with words that can't express
The truth implies, you're high and dry, and you're a long way from happy
You're a long way from happy, you're a long way from happiness
Ah...
Ah...
Ah...
