<song artist="Elton_John" title="Venzuela">
Fresh bait sails a net and a wooden spear
The Amazon basin ain't too far but it ain't too near
I'll never sink my tackle in that water
I'm not a jungle son, I got rum soaked
Hooked a line and I caught her
Oh Venezuela, salted sea is all I've ever had
Sailing from Caracas up to Trinidad
Oh, Venezuela been on a shrimp boat for too long
Trolling shark through waters from the surf to sun
Sunset sees man rest on a charted isle
Mama cooks fresh fish on a driftwood fire
Oh, he's early rise when the sky lights Barcelona
I'm not a jungle son, I got rum soaked
Hooked a line and I caught her
Off the coast the schooner boasts
They found a pirate wreck
While the barracuda fights
For breath upon the open deck
Sharing stories of Captain Morgan
And the Mary Celeste
