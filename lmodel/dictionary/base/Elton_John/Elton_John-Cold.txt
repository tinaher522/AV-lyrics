<song artist="Elton_John" title="Cold">
You don't love him anymore
He threw your ragdoll out the door
I kept my distance
I held my breath
Love always ends up hangin by a thread
Love hurts so much
Love leaves a scar
"I don't love you" is like a stake being driven through your heart
But I don't care
I came back for you
Love is cruel
But I don't care
I wanted you
And I'm-a cold 
Cold, cold
You said "don't cry" to me
He said I'm a dead man if you leave
I have no feeling
I have no heart
Love always cuts out the warm and tender part
Love hurts so much
Love cuts so deep
It's a hot sweat and a cold shake
Like drownin' in your sleep
But I don't care
I came back for you
Love is cruel
But I don't care
I wanted you
And I'm-a cold
Cold, cold
Oh, love hurts so much
Love leaves a scar
"I don't love you" is like a stake being driven through your heart
But I don't care
I came back for you
I don't care
I came back for you
Love is cruel
I don't care
I wanted you
And I'm cold
Cold, cold
I'm cold, oh
So cold, cold
Oh cold
Honey I'm-a cold
So cold, I'm so cold
Cold, oh cold
I'm so cold..
Cold, oh so cold...
Cold
I'm so cold.
