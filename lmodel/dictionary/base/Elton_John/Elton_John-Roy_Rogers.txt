<song artist="Elton_John" title="Roy_Rogers">
Sometimes you dream
Sometimes it seems
There's nothing there at all
You just seem older than yesterday
And you're waiting for tomorrow to call
You draw to the curtains
And one things for certain
You're cozy in your little room
The carpets all paid for god bless the TV
Let them go shoot a hole in the moon
And Roy Rogers is riding tonight
Returning to our silver screen
Comic book characters never grow old
Evergreen heroes whose stories are told
Of a great sequined cowboy
Who sings of the plains
Of round-ups and rustlers and home on the range
Turn on the TV
Shut out the lights
Roy Rogers is riding tonight
9 o'clock mornings 5 o'clock evenings
I'd liven the pace if I could
Oh I'd rather have ham in my sandwich than cheese 
But complain' wouldn't do any good
Lay back in my armchair
Close eyes and think clear
I can hear hoof beats ahead
Roy and Trigger have just hit the hilltop 
While the wife and the kids are in bed
And Roy Rogers is riding tonight
Returning to our silver screen
Comic book characters never grow old
Evergreen heroes whose stories are told
Of a great sequined cowboy
Who sings of the plains
Of round-ups and rustlers and home on the range
Turn on the TV
Shut out the lights
Roy Rogers is riding tonight
