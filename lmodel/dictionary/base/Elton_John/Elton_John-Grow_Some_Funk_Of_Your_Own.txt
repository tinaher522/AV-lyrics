<song artist="Elton_John" title="Grow_Some_Funk_Of_Your_Own">
Yeah, I looked at my watch
And it said a quarter to five
The headlines screamed 
That I was still alive
I couldn't understand it
I thought I died last night
Oh, I dreamed I'd been in a border town
In a little cantina
That the boys had found
I was desperate to dance
Just to dig the local sounds
When along came a señorita
She looked so good 
That I had to meet her
I was ready to approach her
With my English charm
When her brass knuckled boyfriend
Grabbed me by the arm
Oh, he was so macho
And he said grow some funk of your own, amigo
Grow some funk of your own
We no like to with the gringo fight
But there might be a death in Mexico tonight
If you can't grow some funk of your own, amigo
Grow some funk of your own
Take my advice, take the next flight
And grow your funk, grow your funk at home
I mean the situation was ridiculous
Well, I looked for support 
From the rest of my friends
For their vanishing trick
They get ten out of ten
I knelt to pray
Just to see if he would comprehend
But I dreamed I'd been in a border town
In a little cantina
That the boys had found
I was desperate to dance
Just to dig the local sounds
When along came a señorita
She looked so good 
That I had to meet her
I was ready to approach her 
With my English charm
When her brass knuckled boyfriend 
Grabbed me by the arm
Oh, it hurt so much
And he said grow some funk of your own, amigo
Grow some funk of your own
We no like to with the gringo fight
But there might be a death in Mexico tonight
If you can't grow some funk of your own, amigo
Grow some funk of your own
You take my advice, you take the next flight
And grow your funk, grow your funk at home
