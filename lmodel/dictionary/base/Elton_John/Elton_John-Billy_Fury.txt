<song artist="Elton_John" title="Billy_Fury">
Mirror, mirror, won't you give me
Reflections of another wanna be, wanna be
Lam and silky lingerie
Satin hearts and dolls at center stage
His lip and left leg quivered
He'd stand and he'd deliver
And on my knee in sixty-three
I was Billy Fury in my mirror
Oh, I'd wanna be, I wanna be
Like Billy Fury
I wanna be mean and blond
Wanna mumble perfect jumbo
With a little innuendo
I want it to be
'Like you've never been gone'
Stereo monaural, both compatible
Dansette playing another shake, rattle and roll
The D.J.'s say this boy really matters
Pre-fab four on a disc and platter
And his quiff was sprung with grease
He was torn up underneath
But in my room I played my broom
While Billy Fury made them scream
