<song artist="Elton_John" title="All_That_I'm_Allowed_(I'm_Thankful)">
What about the life that you were dreaming of?
What about the picture in my head?
What about the love that we were fighting for?
Is it still somewhere alive or is it dead?
How could we ever go so wrong?
I always thought that we were strong
But all that I'm allowed tomorrow
And if you leave me cold tonight
(If I'm thankful leave me cold tonight)
(Do you really wanna see me cry?)
I'm gonna live my life in sorrow
And you'll forever see me cry
(If I'm thankful leave me cold tonight)
What about the home that we were building up?
What about the colours in our hearts?
What about the kids we should be playing with?
Should we leave this fantasy into the dark?
You are as shining as the sun
You are the place where I belong
You are the place where I belong, baby
But all that I'm allowed tomorrow
And if you leave me cold tonight
(If I'm thankful leave me cold tonight)
(Do you really wanna see me cry?)
I'm gonna live my life in sorrow
And you'll forever see me cry
(If I'm thankful leave me cold tonight)
(Do you really wanna see me cry?)
Do you share the pain inside?
Do you know how much it bites?
Do you mind to watch me fall?
When heaven finally comes to call
But all that I'm allowed tomorrow
And if you leave me cold tonight
(If I'm thankful leave me cold tonight)
(Do you really wanna see me cry?)
I'm gonna live my life in sorrow
And you'll forever see me cry
(If I'm thankful leave me cold tonight)
But all that I'm allowed tomorrow
You've got to leave me cold tonight
