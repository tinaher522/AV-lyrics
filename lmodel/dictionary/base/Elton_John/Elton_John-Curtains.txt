<song artist="Elton_John" title="Curtains">
I used to know this old scarecrow 
He was my song 
My joy and sorrow 
Cast alone between the furrows 
Of a field no longer sown by anyone 
I held a dandelion 
That said the time had come 
To leave upon the wind 
Not to return 
When summer burned the earth again 
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh ... 
Cultivate the freshest flower 
This garden ever grew 
Beneath these branches 
I once wrote such childish words for you 
But that's okay 
There's treasure children always seek to find 
And just like us 
You must have had 
A once upon a time 
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh...
(Lonely lonely lady, lonely lonely lady...)
