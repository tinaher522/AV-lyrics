<song artist="Elton_John" title="Philadelphia_Freedom">
I used to be a rolling stone, you know
If the cause was right
I'd leave to find the answer on the road
I used to be a heart beating for someone
But the times have changed
The less I say the more my work gets done
'Cause I live and breathe this Philadelphia freedom
From the day that I was born I've waved the flag
Philadelphia freedom took me knee-high to a man, yeah
Gave me peace of mind my daddy never had
Oh Philadelphia freedom shine on me, I love you
Shine the light through the eyes of the ones left behind
Shine the light, shine the light
Shine the light, won't you shine the light
Philadelphia freedom I love you, yes I do
If you choose to you can live your life alone
Some people choose the city
Some other choose the good old family home
I like living easy without family ties
Till the whipoorwill of freedom zapped me
Right between the eyes
'Cause I live and breathe this Philadelphia freedom
From the day that I was born I've waved the flag
Philadelphia freedom took me knee-high to a man
Gave me peace of mind my daddy never had
Oh Philadelphia freedom shine on me, I love you
Shine the light through the eyes of the ones left behind
Shine the light, shine the light
Shine the light, won't you shine the light
Philadelphia freedom I love you, yes I do
Philadelphia freedom shine on me, I love you
Shine the light through the eyes of the ones left behind
Shine the light, shine the light
Shine the light, won't you shine the light
Philadelphia freedom I love you
You know I love you
You know I love you
Yes I do
Philadelphia freedom, I love you, yes I do
Philadelphia freedom, you know that I love you, yes I do
Philadelphia freedom, don't you know that I love you, yes I do
Philadelphia freedom, don't you know that I love you, yes I do
