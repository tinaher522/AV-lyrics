<song artist="Elton_John" title="Tower_Of_Babel">
Snow
Cement
And ivory young towers
Someone called us Babylon
Those hungry hunters
Tracking down the hours
But where all your shoulders when cried
Were the darlings on the sideline
Dreaming up such cherished lies
To whisper in your ear before you die
It's party time for the guys in the tower of Babel
Sodom meet Gomorrah
Cain meet Abel
Have a ball ya'all
See the letches crawl
With the call girls under the table
Watch 'em dig their graves
'Cause Jesus don't save the guys
In the tower of Babel
Junk.
Angel,
This closet's always stacked
The dealers in the basement
Filling you prescription
For a brand new heart attack
But where all your shoulders when we cried
Were the doctors in attendance
Saying how they felt so sick inside
Or was it just the scalpel blade that lied
