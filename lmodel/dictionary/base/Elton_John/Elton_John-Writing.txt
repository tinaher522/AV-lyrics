<song artist="Elton_John" title="Writing">
"Is there anything left?
Maybe steak and eggs.
Waking up to washing up,
Making up your bed.
Lazy days, my razor blade
Could use a better edge.
It's enough to make you laugh
Relax in a nice cool bath.
Inspiration for navigation
Of our new found craft.
I know you, and you know me,
Its always half and half...
And we were oh oh, so you know
Not the kind to dawdle,
Will the things we wrote today
Sound as good tomorrow?
Will we still be writing?
In approaching years
Stifling yawns on Sundays 
As the weekends disappear.
We could stretch our legs if we'd half a mind
But dont disturb us if you hear us trying
To instigate the structure of another line or two. 
Cause writin's lightin' up, 
And I like life enough; to see it through."
