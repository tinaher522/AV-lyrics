<song artist="Elton_John" title="Corrugated_Iron">
Poor family got a lean to
Now the rainy season's gone
Colored kids, playin' in the hard mud
Kicking that skinny dog
He works on irrigation, moving water to the
And he dreams of being a spear someday
In the heart of Johannesburg
He dreams of being a spear someday
In the heart of Johannesburg
And we live in, and we live on
And we die in corrugated iron
Pray to Tokoloshe
When the red dirt comes back
Cattle try to find the river bed
And in between the cracks
Chief man he got his hard hat
From the civilized Western man
He's got a ton of 'em down in Capetown
He's gonna grease the poor black hand
He's got a ton of 'em down in Capetown
He's gonna grease the poor black hand
And we live in, and we live on
And we die in corrugated iron
And we're building, and we're trying
Our tribes are born in corrugated iron
You gotta stand to the left
Remain at the back
And give 'em corrugated iron
To put on their shacks
Stand to the left
Remain at the back
And give 'em corrugated iron
To put on their shacks
And he dreams of being a spear someday
In the heart of Johannesburg
He's got a ton of 'em down in Capetown
He's gonna grease the poor black hand
And we live in, and we live on
And we die in corrugated iron
And we're building, and we're trying
Our tribes are born in corrugated iron
