<song artist="Elton_John" title="Go_Out_And_Get_It">
And it's yours, go out and get it
Don't get wet, please keep dry
Think about the people who made you cry
I believe in the ??? of every man
Where ??? take notice of ???
If you see the road turning straight ahead
Got to run on down, never never be afraid
I know a man, well he's six feet tall
Buckskin jacket ???
From the Boston town, yeah, is educated well
And he ??? about himself
Behind the curtain, upon the shelf
Lived a man ???
Behind his his eyes, behind his smile
What's going on, anybody in the world can tell
