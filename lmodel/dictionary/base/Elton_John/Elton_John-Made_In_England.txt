<song artist="Elton_John" title="Made_In_England">
I was made in England
Out of Cadillac muscle
I had a quit-me father
Had a love-me mother
I had Little Richard
And that black piano
Oh that sweet Georgia Peach
And the boy from Tupelo
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I was made in England
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I was made in England
I was made in England
Out of Cadillac muscle
Face down on a playground
Crying God send me a brother
Not a bloody nose
For Rock and Roll
Give me that sweet Georgia Peach
And the boy from Tupelo
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I was made in England
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I was made in England
I was made in England
Like a blue Cortina
But a Yankee summer
Had a way about her
You had a scent for scandal
Well, here's my middle finger
I had forty years of pain
And nothing to cling to
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I was made in England
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I was made in England
If you're made in England
You're built to last
You can still say "homo"
And everybody laughs
But the joke's on you
You never read the song
They all think they know
But they all got it wrong
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I was made in England
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I was made in England
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I was made in England
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I was made in England, yes
I was made in England
I was made in England
I was made in England
