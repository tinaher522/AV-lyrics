<song artist="Elton_John" title="Wrap_Her_Up">
There are ladies, illegal X's
Mona Lisas, well connected
They may be shady, English roses
Blue blooded, turned up noses
Money talks, see what it catches
Postage paid, no strings attached
She's a honey, she's a tramp
Roaring twenties, molls and vamps
Wrap her up, I'll take her home with me
Wrap her up, she is all I need
Wrap her up, I only get one chance
Beasts and beauties, but they all can dance
Wrap her up, I'll take her home with me
Wrap her up, she is all I need
Wrap her up
Give her to me, wrap her up
Is she foreign, legs eleven
Italian girls, take me to heaven
You pretty babies, from Paris, France
Crazy horses, love to dance
Wrap her up, I'll take her home with me
Wrap her up, she is all I need
Wrap her up, I only get one chance
Beasts and beauties, but they all can dance
Wrap her up, I'll take her home with me
Wrap her up, she is all I need
Wrap her up, I only get one chance
Beasts and beauties, but they all can dance
Give it to me, wrap her up
Wrap her up, I'll take her home with me
Wrap her up, she is all I need
Wrap her up, I only get one chance
Beasts and beauties, but they all can dance
Wrap her up, I'll take her home with me
Wrap her up, she is all I need
Wrap her up, I only get one chance
Beasts and beauties, but they all can dance
Give it to me, wrap her up
