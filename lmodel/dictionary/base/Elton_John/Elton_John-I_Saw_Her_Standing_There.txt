<song artist="Elton_John" title="I_Saw_Her_Standing_There">
Well, she was just seventeen
And you know what I mean
And the way she looked was way beyond compare
How could I dance with another
When I saw her standing there
Well, she looked at me
And I, I could see
That before too long, I fell in love with her
How could I dance with another
When I saw her standing there
Well, my heart went boom
When I crossed that room
And I held her hand in mine
Oh, we danced through the night
And we held each other tight
And before too long, I fell in love with her
How could I dance with another
When I saw her standing there
Well, my heart went boom
When I crossed that room
And I held her hand in mine
Oh, we danced through the night
And we held each other tight
And before too long, I fell in love with her
How could I dance with another
When I saw her standing there
When I saw her standing there
