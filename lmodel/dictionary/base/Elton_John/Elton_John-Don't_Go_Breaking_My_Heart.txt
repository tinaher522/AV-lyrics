<song artist="Elton_John" title="Don't_Go_Breaking_My_Heart">
Don't go breaking my heart
I couldn't if I tried
Honey, if I get restless
Baby, you're not that kind
Don't go breaking my heart
You take the weight off me
Honey, when you knock on my door
Ooh, I gave you my key
(Hoo hoo, nobody knows it)
When I was down
I was your clown
(Hoo hoo, nobody knows it (Nobody knows it))
Right from the start
I gave you my heart
Oh oh, I gave you my heart
So don't go breaking my heart
I won't go breaking your heart
(Don't go breaking my heart)
And nobody told us
'Cause nobody showed us
And now it's up to us, babe
Whoa, I think we can make it
So don't misunderstand me
You put the light in my life
Oh, you put the spark to the flame
I've got your heart in my sights
(Hoo hoo, nobody knows it)
When I was down
I was your clown
(Hoo hoo, nobody knows it (Nobody knows it))
Right from the start
I gave you my heart
Oh oh, I gave you my heart
Don't go breaking my heart
I won't go breaking your heart
(Don't go breaking my heart)
(Hoo hoo, nobody knows it)
When I was down
I was your clown
Right from the start
I gave you my heart
Oh oh, I gave you my heart
Don't go breaking my heart
I won't go breaking your heart (Don't go breaking my, don't go breaking my)
Don't go breaking my heart (Don't go breaking my, don't go breaking my)
I won't go breaking your heart
Don't go breaking my heart (Don't go breaking my, ahh)
I won't go breaking your heart
Don't go breaking my heart (Don't go breaking my, ahh)
I won't go breaking your heart
Don't go breaking my heart (Don't go breaking my, ahh)
I won't go breaking your heart
Don't go breaking my heart (Don't go breaking my, ahh)
I won't go breaking your heart
Don't go breaking my heart (Don't go breaking my, ahh)
I won't go breaking your heart
Don't go breaking my heart (Don't go breaking my, ahh)
I won't go breaking your heart
Don't go breaking my heart (Don't go breaking my, ahh)
I won't go breaking your heart
