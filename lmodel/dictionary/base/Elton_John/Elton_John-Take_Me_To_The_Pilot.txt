<song artist="Elton_John" title="Take_Me_To_The_Pilot">
If you feel that it's real I'm on trial
And I'm here in your prison
Like a coin in your mint
I am dented and I'm spent with high treason
Through a glass eye your throne
Is the one danger zone
Take me to the pilot for control
Take me to the pilot of your soul
Take me to the pilot
Lead me through the chamber
Take me to the pilot
I am but a stranger
Take me to the pilot
Lead me through the chamber
Take me to the pilot
I am but a stranger
Well I know he's not old 
And I'm told he's a virgin
For he may be she
But what I'm told is never for certain
Through a glass eye your throne
Is the one danger zone
Take me to the pilot for control
Take me to the pilot of your soul, yeah, yeah
Take me to the pilot
Lead me through the chamber
Take me to the pilot
I am but a stranger
Take me to the pilot
Lead me through the chamber
Take me to the pilot
I am but a stranger
Take me, take me, oh, oh
Take me, take me, yeah, yeah
Take me, take me, baby, baby, baby
Take me, take me
