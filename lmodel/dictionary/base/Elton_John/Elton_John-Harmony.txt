<song artist="Elton_John" title="Harmony">
Hello, baby, hello!
Haven't seen your face for a while
Have you quit doing time for me-- or are you still
The same spoiled child?
Hello, I said hello!
Is the only place you thought to go?
Am I the only man you ever had or am I just the last surviving
Friend that you know?
Harmony and me, we're pretty good company
Looking for an island in our boat upon the sea
Harmony, gee I really love you and I want to love you forever
And dream of never never never leavin' Harmony.
Hello, Baby, Hello!
Open up your heart and let you feelings flow
You're not lucky knowing me.
Keeping the speed real slow.
In any case I'm settin my own pace by stealing the show.
Say hello hello
Whoa
Harmony and me, we're pretty good company
Looking for an island in our boat upon the sea
Harmony, gee, I really love you and I want to love you forever
And dream of never never never leavin' Harmony.
Never leaving Harmony
Harmony, Harmony, Harmony, Harmony
Harmony, Harmony, Harmony
AAAHHH!
