<song artist="Elton_John" title="Little_Jeannie">
Oh, little Jeannie
You got so much love
Little Jeannie
And you take it where it strikes 
And give it to the likes of me
Oh, little Jeannie
She got so much love
Little Jeannie
So I see you when I can
You make me all a man can be
And I want you to be my acrobat
I want you to be my lover
Oh, there were others 
Who would treat you cruel
And, oh, Jeannie
You were always someone's fool
Little Jeannie
You got so much time
Little Jeannie
Though you've grown beyond your years
You still retain the fears of youth
Oh, little Jeannie
You got so much time
Little Jeannie
But you're burning it up so fast
Searching for some lasting truth
And I want you to be my acrobat
I want you to be my lover
Oh, there were others 
Who would treat you cruel
But, oh, Jeannie
I will always be your fool
And I want you to be my acrobat
I want you to be my lover
Oh, there were others
And I've known quite a few
But oh, Jeannie
I'm still in love with you
(You stepped into my life from a bad dream
Making the life that I had seem suddenly shiny and new)
Oh, Jeannie (Oh, Jeannie)
I'm so in love with you
(You stepped into my life from a bad dream
Making the life that I had seem suddenly shiny and new)
Oh, Jeannie (Oh, Jeannie) 
I'm so in love with you
(You stepped into my life from a bad dream
Making the life that I had seem suddenly shiny and new)
Oh, Jeannie (Oh, Jeannie)
I'm so in love with you
(You stepped into my life from a bad dream) So in love
(Making the life that I had seem suddenly shiny and new) So in love with you
Oh, Jeannie (Oh, Jeannie) 
I'm so in love, I'm so
(You stepped into my life from a bad dream) In love
(Making the life that I had seem suddenly shiny and new) So in love with you
