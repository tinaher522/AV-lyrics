Nants ingonyama bagithi baba (There comes a lion)
Sithi uhm ingonyama (Oh yes, it's a lion)
Nants ingonyama bagithi baba (There comes a lion)
Sithi uhm ingonyama (Oh yes, it's a lion)
Ingonyama
Siyo Nqoba (We're going to conquer)
Ingonyama
Ingonyama nengw' enamabaal (It's a lion and a tiger)
Ingonyama nengw' enamabaal (It's a lion and a tiger)
Ingonyama nengw' enamabaal (It's a lion and a tiger)
Ingonyama nengw' enamabaal (It's a lion and a tiger)
Ingonyama nengw' enamabaal (It's a lion and a tiger)
Ingonyama nengw' enamabala (Se-to-kwa!)
Ingonyama nengw' enamabala (Asana)
From the day we arrive on this planet
And blinking, step into the sun
There's more to see than can ever be seen
More to do than can ever be done
There is far too much to take in here
More to find than can ever be found
But the sun rolling high through the sapphire sky
Keeps great and small on the endless round
It's the circle of life and it moves us all
Through despair and hope, through faith and love
Till we find our place on the path unwinding
In the circle, the circle of life
It's the circle of life and it moves us all
Through despair and hope, through faith and love
Till we find our place on the path unwinding
In the circle, the circle of life
