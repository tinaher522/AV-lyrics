<song artist="Elton_John" title="Monkey_On_My_Back">
There's moonlight on the crystals
Laid on the back of my hand
Temptation lies in the ocean
And I'm laid out in the sand
There's blood on my rear view mirror
And a siren in the street
There's a fog out here in Malibu
And a needle at my feet
There's a mobile home in Carmel
Stranded in a trailer park
A teenage mother hides herself
From the eyes of the loan shark
She's beggin' me, "Honey, don't go
It's not worth the pain
You can't go on playin'
This dangerous game"
This monkey on my back
Left me stranded in L.A.
With a busted truck and a chewed up arm
And a cravin' in my veins
There's a chopper with a searchlight
Whirlin' overhead
The L.A.P.D.'s on the beach
And this bust's been put to bed
Buried deep the white fire heats
The slug stuck in my side
Runnin' bags for crooked cash
Took me one too many miles
It's gotta be over, poor boy
Their sights were set on me
Never figured sand turned red at night
Don't want no sheet over me
They chased me clear down from Monterey
But I lost them on the freeway
I ran a speedtrap and hell I almost got away
So I took Ventura through the mountains
And sunset to the sea
They winged me out in the Palisades
When I stopped off to get some change
But I never got to use the phone
They was like Apaches round a wagon train
