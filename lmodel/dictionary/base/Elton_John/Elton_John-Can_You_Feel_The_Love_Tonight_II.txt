<song artist="Elton_John" title="Can_You_Feel_The_Love_Tonight_II">
Timon
I can see what's happening (Pumbaa: What?)
And they don't have a clue (Pumbaa: Who?)
They'll fall in love and here's the bottom line
Our trio's down to two (Pumbaa: Oh.)
The sweet caress of twilight
There's magic everywhere
And with all this romantic atmosphere
Disaster's in the air
Chorus
Can you feel the love tonight
The peace the evening brings
The world for once in perfect harmony
With all its living things
Simba
So many things to tell her
But how to make her see
The truth about my past, impossible
She'd turn away from me
Nala
He's holding back, he's hiding
But what, I can't decide
Why won't he be the king I know he is?
The king I see inside?
Chorus
Can you feel the love tonight?
The peace the evening brings
The world, for once, in perfect harmony
With all its living things
Simba &amp; Nala
Can you feel the love tonight?
You needn't look too far
Stealing through the night's uncertainties
Love is where they are
Nala
And if he feels the love tonight
In the way I do
Simba
It's enough for this restless wanderer
Both
Just to be with you
