<song artist="Elton_John" title="Lonely_This_Christmas">
It'll be lonely this Christmas
Without you to hold
It'll be lonely this Christmas
Lonely and cold
It'll be cold, so cold
Without you to hold
This Christmas
Try to imagine a house that's not a home
Try to imagine a Christmas all alone
That's where I'll be since you left me
My tears could melt the snow
What can I do without you?
I've got no place
No place to go
It'll be lonely this Christmas
Without you to hold
It'll be lonely this Christmas
Lonely and cold
It'll be cold, so cold
Without you to hold
This Christmas
It'll be lonely this Christmas
Without you to hold
It'll be lonely this Christmas
Lonely and cold
It'll be cold, so cold
Without you to hold
This Christmas
This Christmas
