<song artist="Elton_John" title="Nobody_Wins">
They must have loved each other once
but that was many years ago
and by the time i came along
things were already going wrong
i felt the pain in their pretence
the side they tried hard not to show
but through the simple eyeys of youth
it wasn't hard to see the truth
And in the end nobody wins
when loves begins to fall apart
and it's the innocent who pay
when broken dreams get in the way
the game begins
the game nobody wins
they must have loved each other once
before the magic slipped away
and as their life became a lie
what love remained began to die
i used to hide beneath the sheets
i prayed that time would find a way
but with the passing of the years
i watched as laughter turned to tears
and in the end nobody wins...
We used to love each other once
with all the passion we posessed
but people change as time goes by
some feelings grow while others die
but if we can learn from what we'll see
and face the truth while we still can
then, though the passion may be gone
some kind of love can still live on
