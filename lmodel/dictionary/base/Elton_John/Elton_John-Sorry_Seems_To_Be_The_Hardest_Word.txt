<song artist="Elton_John" title="Sorry_Seems_To_Be_The_Hardest_Word">
What do I got to do to make you love me?
What do I got to do to make you care?
What do I do when lightning strikes me?
And awake to find that you are not there
What do I got to do to make you want me?
What do I got to do to be heard?
What do I say when it's all over?
Sorry seems to be the hardest word
It's sad (so sad) so sad
It's a sad sad situation
And it's getting more and more absurd
It's sad (so sad) so sad
Why can't we talk it over
Oh, it seems to me that sorry seems to be the hardest word
It's sad (so sad) so sad
It's a sad sad situation
And it's getting more and more absurd
It's sad (so sad) so sad
Why can't we talk it over
Oh, it seems to me that sorry seems to be the hardest word
What do I do to make you love me?
What do I got to do to be heard?
What do I do when lightning strikes me?
What have I got to do?
What have I got to do?
When sorry seems to be the hardest word
