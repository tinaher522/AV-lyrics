<song artist="Ed_Sheeran" title="Wayfaring_Stranger">
Oooh ooh ooh
Ooooh oooh oooh ooh
I am a poor wayfaring stranger
Travelling through, this world alone
There's no sickness, toil or danger
And that bright laight to which i go
And i'm going there to see my mother
And i'm going there no more to roam
I'm only going over jordan
I'm only going over home now
Hey-ey yeah
Mmmm
Ooohhh
I know dark clouds will gather me
I know my way's rough and steep
And the beautiful fields lie just beyond me
And i know my way's rough and steep
I'm going there to see my mother
I'm going there no more to roam
I'm only going over jordan
I'm only going over home now
Coz i am a poor wayfaring stranger
Travelling through, this world alone
There's no sickness, toil or danger
And that bright laight to which i go
I'm going there to see my mother
I'm going there no more to roam
I'm only going over jordan
I'm only going home now
