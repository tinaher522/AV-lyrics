<song artist="Ed_Sheeran" title="Autumn_Leaves">
Another day another life
Passes by just like mine
It's not complicated
Another mind
Another soul
Another body to grow old
It's not complicated
Do you ever wonder if the stars shine out for you?
Float down
Like autumn leaves
Hush now
Close your eyes before the sleep
And your miles away 
And yesterday you were here with me
Another tear
Another cry
Another place for us to die
Its not complicated
Another life that's gone to waste 
Another light lost from your face
It's complicated
Is it only wonder or do birds still sing for you?
Float down
Like autumn leaves
Hush now
Close your eyes before the sleep
And your miles away 
And yesterday you were here with me
Ooh how I miss you
My symphony places the song that carries you out
Ooh how I miss you
I miss you and I wish you'd stay 
Is it any wonder that the stars shine out for you?
Float down
Like autumn leaves
Hush now
Close your eyes before the sleep
And your miles away 
And yesterday you were here with me
Float down
Like autumn leaves
Hush now
Close your eyes before the sleep
And your miles away 
And yesterday you were here with me
Ooh oh, ooh oh
Ooh oh, ooh oh
Touch down 
Like a seven four seven 
Stay out and we'll live forever now
