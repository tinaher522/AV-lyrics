<song artist="Ed_Sheeran" title="You">
The thoughts I have could be clear ones and they can seem vivid but not near ones feather than limits I block her out so when I'm looking through my mind she ain't in it can I be free for a minute? Can I be me for a minute the thoughts I have could be dark ones even be smart ones, you know I'm going to have a couple straight from the heart once, tell you what I think I will until I depart mum it's you that I live for I'm the first and the last ones,I love you lots what better than thinking about the ones you love nothing much when your thinking about the ones you love I feel the same when I'm on the floor see the sun above unconditional Like
