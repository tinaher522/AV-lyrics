<song artist="Rihanna" title="Get_Over_With">
It's dark in the day now, I'll say now don't complain
Look up the sun is just a cloud away
You're so afraid to cry
But your heart be feeling dry, it's time to change
But you keep thundering, thundering
I'm wondering, wondering
Why you keep thundering
Won't you just rain and get it over with
Tonight feel the pain, now babe I won't complain
I hear you say, look up the sun is just a cloud away
And now we're so afraid to cry
But when you need a wave to ride that's the way
You keep thundering, thundering
I'm wondering, wondering
Why you keep thundering
Won't you just fucking rain and get it over with
And get it over with, I see you rolling it
Let's get it over with, get high and float again
Roll up and go again, I see you rolling it
Let's get it over with
Get high and float again
Roll up and go again, it's alright
We can roll in the clouds, getting high
We can float in the clouds, it's alright
We can roll in the clouds, getting high
We can float in the clouds, it's alright
We can roll on the clouds, getting high
We can float in the clouds
Keep thundering, thundering
I'm wondering, wondering
Why you keep thundering
Won't you just fucking just rain and get it over with
And get it over with, I see you rolling it
Lets get it over with, get high and float again
Roll up and go again, I see you rolling it
Lets get it over with
Get high and float again
Roll up and go again, it's alright
We can roll In the clouds, getting high
We can float in the clouds, it's alright
We can roll in the clouds, getting high
We can float in the clouds, it's alright
We can roll on the clouds, getting high
We can float in the clouds
And get it over with, I see you rolling it
Lets get it over with. get high and float again
Roll up and go again, I see you rolling it
Lets get it over with
Get high and float again
Roll up and go again, ot's alright
We can roll In the clouds, getting high
We can float in the clouds, it's alright
We can roll in the clouds, getting high
We can float in the clouds, it's alright
We can roll on the clouds, getting high
We can float in the clouds
We should be lighting it up, we should be lighting it up
Start it with a lighting, it's dark in the day now
Say now don't complain
Look up the sun is just a cloud away
