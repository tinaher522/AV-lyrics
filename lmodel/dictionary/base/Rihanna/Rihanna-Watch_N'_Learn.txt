<song artist="Rihanna" title="Watch_N'_Learn">
Won't say a thing
About the way you love me
'Cept for I like the way
I love the way you touch me
If I turn it, leave it, turn it up
Then I drop it, drop it
Till ya making faces
At me like you wanna
Tell me stop it
Imma do it, do it, do it
Till you can’t take no more
Till my lipstick ain’t up on my face no more
I'mma do it, do it, do it
On the bed, on the floor, on the couch
Only cause your lips say make it to my mouth
Just because I can’t kiss back
Doesn’t mean you can’t kiss that
Oh, baby, baby, just like that
Slow baby, baby, just like that
Oh, baby, baby, turn me out
Oh, baby, baby, it's your turn now
It's your turn now, it's your turn now
It's your turn now, it's your turn now
Watch n' learn now, watch n' learn how
Watch n' learn now, eh eh eh eh
Oh, baby, baby
Oh, baby, baby
If you learn now, if you learn now
If you learn how, I'll stay
Don't ask me if
You were the first to sleep here
'Cause if he did
You wouldn't even be here
If I turn it, leave it, turn it up
Then I drop it, drop it
Till ya making faces
At me like you wanna
Tell me stop it
Imma do it, do it, do it
Till you can’t take no more
Till my lipstick ain’t up on my face no more
Imma do it, do it, do it
On the bed, on the floor, on the couch
Only cause your lips say make it to my mouth
Just because I can’t kiss back
Doesn’t mean you can’t kiss that
Oh, baby, baby, just like that
Slow baby, baby, just like that
Oh, baby, baby, turn me out
Oh, baby, baby, it's your turn now
It's your turn now, it's your turn now
It's your turn now, it's your turn now
Watch n' learn now, watch n' learn how
Watch n' learn now, eh eh eh eh
Oh, baby, baby
Oh, baby, baby
If you learn now, if you learn now
If you learn how, I'll stay
Oh come put my love against your kiss
Oh na, na, na, la, la, la,
Just like this, no now don't be shy
Baby all I need, oh do it on me
Like you aim to please
Show me how much you need me by
The way that you please me, baby
I'mma do it, do it, do it
On the bed, on the floor, on the couch
Only cause your lips say make it to my mouth
Just because I can’t kiss back
Doesn’t mean you can’t kiss that
Oh, baby, baby, just like that
Slow baby, baby, just like that
Oh, baby, baby, turn me out
Oh, baby, baby, it's your turn now
It's your turn now, it's your turn now
It's your turn now, it's your turn now
Watch n' learn now, watch n' learn how
Watch n' learn now, eh eh eh eh
Oh, baby, baby
Oh, baby, baby
If you learn now, if you learn now
If you learn how, I'll stay
