Rihanna....
I Know You Cheated On Me Man..
I Heard The Story..
I Know....
[Rihanna:]
Story Of My Life
Searching For The Right
But It Keeps Avoiding Me
Sorrow In My Soul
Cause It Seems That Wrong
Really Loves My Company
He's More Than A Man
And This Is More Than Love
The Reason That The Sky Is Blue
But Clouds Are Rolling In
Because I'm Gone Again
And To Him I Just Can't Be True
And I Know That He Knows I'm Unfaithful
And It Kills Him Inside
To Know That I Am Happy With Some Other Guy
I Can See Him Dying
I Don't Wanna Do This Anymore
I Don't Wanna Be The Reason Why
Everytime I Walk Out The Door
I See Him Die A Little More Inside
I Don't Wanna Hurt Him Anymore
I Don't Wanna Take Away His Life
I Don't Wanna Be...
A Murderer
[Royalty:]
So Many Nights On The Road Im Alone,
Seenin' Me Dialing Your Phone,
Wondering Why Your Not Home,
Finding Out Your Not Alone,
Im Hearing Romours From All These Familiar Faces,
They Tellin Me Your Cheating,
Revealing Your Secret Places,
Showing Me Locations Of All Your Private Vacations,
And Showing Me The Phone Bill Of All Your Convosations,
I Pay For That Cell Phone,
I Sign For Your Car Loan,
I Pay For Your Wardrobe,
And Purchased Your All Home,
I Gave You Ma Whole Life ,
I Turned You To My Wife,
No Money And No Price,
Can Match What I Sacrafice..
And You Repayin' Me By Playin' Me,
Tellin Me Your Sorry For All The Times You Lied,
Baby Your Unfaithful,
Now Im Truly Grateful,
Here Is My Goodbye...
Can You Feel Me Dieing.
[Rihanna:]
I Don't Wanna Do This Anymore
I Don't Wanna Be The Reason Why
Everytime I Walk Out The Door
I See Him Die A Little More Inside
I Don't Wanna Hurt Him Anymore
I Don't Wanna Take Away His Life
I Don't Wanna Be...
A Murderer
Our Love, His Trust
I Might As Well Take A Gun And Put It To His Head
Get It Over With
I Don't Wanna Do This
[Royalty:]
Baby Why'd You Do It To Me,
I Never Did It To You,
I Know U Cheating On Me,
I Never Cheated On You,
I Never Told You A Lie,
Never Thought We Would Die,
Baby This Is The End,
Baby This Is Goodbye
[Rihanna:]
I Don't Wanna Do This Anymore
I Don't Wanna Be The Reason Why
And Everytime I Walk Out The Door
I See Him Die A Little More Inside
And I Don't Wanna Hurt Him Anymore
I Don't Wanna Take Away His Life
I Don't Wanna Be...
A Murderer 
Baby Thats What You Are,
Baby Thats What You Are,
Baby Thats What You Are,
Baby Thats What You Are,
Baby Thats What You Are,
Baby Thats What You Are,
Baby Thats What You Are,
Baby Thats What You Are,
Baby Thats What You Are,
No No No No
Yeah Yeah Yeah
