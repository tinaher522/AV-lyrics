<song artist="Rihanna" title="Roc_Me_Out">
Yeah, yeah
Give it to me like, I want it
This is for you, eyes on it
Roc me out, back and forth
Roc me out, on the floor
Give it to me like, I need it
You know how to make, me feel it
Roc me out, more and more
Roc me out, on the floor, yeah
Move over boy I'm so ready
You taking too long to get my
Head on the ground and
My feet in the clouds, oh
I'm so clean, feeling so dirty
Come right now, you better hurry
Before you miss out, and 
I it finish off, oh yeah
I've been a bad girl, daddy
Won't you come get me?
Give it to me like, I want it
This is for you, eyes on it
Roc me out, back and forth
Roc me out, on the floor
Give it to me like, I need it
You know how to make, me feel it
Roc me out, more and more
Roc me out, on the floor, yeah
Keep it up for me you can do it
Put your hands on me watch me lose it
Boy it blow it out, like it's the only way out
I'll show you my dirty secrets
Real hush up boy, don't you speak it
What ever we do, is between me and you
I've been a bad girl, daddy
Won't you come get me?
Give it to me like, I want it
This is for you, eyes on it
Roc me out, back and forth
Roc me out, on the floor
Give it to me like, I need it
You know how to make, me feel it
Roc me out, more and more
Roc me out, on the floor, yeah
It's gonna be different tonight
The best time in your life
I just want you to know
Baby take a peak at the girl I hide
I let you in on a dirty secret
I just wanna be loved
Give it to me like, I want it
This is for you, eyes on it
Roc me out, back and forth
Roc me out, on the floor
Give it to me like, I need it
You know how to make, me feel it
Roc me out, more and more
Roc me out, on the floor, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
