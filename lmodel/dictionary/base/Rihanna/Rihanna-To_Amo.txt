<song artist="Rihanna" title="To_Amo">
Te amo, te amo 
She says to me, I hear the pain in her voice 
Then we danced underneath the candelabra she takes the lead 
Thats when i saw it in her eyes its over 
Chorus 
Then she says te amo then she put her hand around me waist 
I told her no, 
She cries Te amo i told her im not gonna run away but let me go 
My soul is crying, without asking why 
I said te amo, wouldnt somebody tell me what she said 
Dont it mean I love you 
Think it means I love you 
Dont it mean I love you 
Te amo, te amo, shes scared to breathe 
I hold her hand, i got no choice uhh 
Pull me out on the beach, danced in the water, i start to leave 
Shes begging me and asking why its over 
Chorus 
Then she says te amo then she put her hand around me waist 
I told her no, 
She cries Te amo i told her im not gonna run away, but let me go 
My soul is crying, without asking why 
I said te amo, wouldnt somebody tell me what she said 
Dont it mean I love you 
Think it means I love you 
Dont it mean I love you 
Think it means I love you 
Then she says te amo then she put her hand around me waist 
I told her no, 
She cries Te amo i told her im not gonna run away but let me go 
My soul is crying, without asking why 
I said te amo, wouldnt somebody tell me what she said 
Dont it mean I love you 
Think it means I love you 
Dont it mean I love you 
Dont it mean I love you 
Think it means i love you
