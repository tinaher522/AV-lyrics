<song artist="Rihanna" title="Suicide">
Everywhere is still 
Everything is restless in my heart 
I hate the way this feels 
Suddenly i'm scared to be apart 
The days are dark when you're not around 
The air is getting hard to breathe 
I wish that you would just put me down 
I wish that i could go to sleep 
Loving you is suicide 
I don't know should go or should i stay 
I'm tryna to keep myself alive 
Knowing there's a chance it's all too late 
But i heard you say you love me 
That's the part i can't forget 
And i wish that you come save me 
Cos i'm standing over the edge 
I should let you go 
Tell myself the things i need to hear 
But my brain is why you're wrong 
That's why i'm loving you when you're not here 
Feels like i drown in your every word 
And every breath that's in between 
Somehow you got me where it really hurts 
It's killing every part of me 
Loving you is suicide 
I don't know should go or should i stay 
I'm tryna to keep myself alive 
Knowing there's a chance it's all too late 
But i heard you say you love me 
That's the part i can't forget 
And i wish that you come save me 
Boy cos i'm standing over the edge 
Loving you is suicide 
And my world's about to break 
And i... had as much as i can take 
And love is a long way down 
Loving you is suicide 
And it's getting harder everyday 
I'm tryna to keep myself alive 
Knowing there's a chance it's all too late 
And i'm way past every moment 
But i'm still determined to fight 
And i know it's taking all my strength 
To give emotions alive 
Loving you is suicide
