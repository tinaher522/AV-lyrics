<song artist="Rihanna" title="Kisses_Don't_Lie">
Kisses dont 
No they dont
Never dont lie
You can run if you want but you cant hide
Tellin' you its the truth dont you ask why
Kisses dont
No they dont
Kisses don't lie
Emotions come and go
Almost how the wind will blow
There so little in this world to trust in
Seduce themselves with lies
Some dont realize
They call it love but its really only lustin'
So you see you and me
We're gettin close to danger zone
Show me how tell me now
Should I stay or should I go
Cause I'm caught between yes and no
Cause when you kiss me
I feel everything that I been missing
I try to slow down but my heart won't listen
And its tearin' me all up inside
And when you touch me
I feel a rush but I'm afraid that it might crush me
Should I put my trust in somethin I dont trust in
I try to run but theres no place to hide
Cause baby kisses dont lie
Kisses dont 
No they dont
Never dont lie
You can run if you want but you cant hide
Tellin' you its the truth don't you ask why
Kisses dont
No they dont
Kisses dont lie
You whisper in my ear
But are your words sincere
Cause pretty words can cut just like a knife
You see I'm nobody's fool
I play by my own rules
So please think twice before you step into my life
So you see you and me
We're gettin close to danger zone
Show me how tell me now
Should I stay or should I go
Cause I'm caught between yes and no
Cause when you kiss me
I feel everything that I been missing
I try to slow down but my heart won't listen
And its tearin' me all up inside
And when you touch me
I feel a rush but I'm afraid that it might crush me
Should I put my trust in somethin I don't trust in
I try to run but theres no place to hide
Cause baby kisses dont lie
Kisses dont 
No they dont
Never don't lie
You can run if you want but you cant hide
Tellin' you its the truth dont you ask why
Kisses dont
No they dont
Kisses dont lie
Kisses dont 
No they dont
Never don't lie
You can run if you want but you cant hide
Tellin' you its the truth dont you ask why
Kisses dont
No they dont
Kisses dont lie
So you see you and me
We're gettin close to danger zone
Show me how tell me now
Should I stay or should I go
Cause I'm caught between yes and no
Cause when you kiss me
I feel everything that I been missing
I try to slow down but my heart won't listen
And its tearin' me all up inside
And when you touch me
I feel a rush but I'm afraid that it might crush me
Should I put my trust in somethin I don't trust in
I try to run but theres no place to hide
Cause baby kisses dont lie
Kisses dont 
No they dont
Never dont lie
You can run if you want but you cant hide
Tellin' you its the truth dont you ask why
Kisses dont
No they dont
Kisses dont lie
