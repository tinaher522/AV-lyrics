<song artist="Rihanna" title="Maneater">
Take it back
Everybody look at me me
I walk in the door you start screaming
Come on everybody, what you here for?
Move your body around like a nympho
Everybody get your neck to crack around
All you crazy people come on jump around
I wanna see you all on your knees knees
You either wanna be with me or be me
Come on now
Maneater, make you work hard, make you spend hard
Make you want all of her love
She's a maneater, make you buy cars, make you cut cards
Make you fall real hard in love
She's a maneater, make you work hard, make you spend hard
Make you want all of her love
She's a maneater, make you buy cars, make you cut cards
Wish you never ever met her at all
And when she walks she walks with passion
When she talks she talks like she can handle it
When she asks for something boy she means it
Even if you never ever see it
Everybody get your neck to crack around
All you crazy people come on jump around
You doing anything to keep her by your side
Because she says she love you love you long time
Come on now
Maneater, make you work hard, make you spend hard
Make you want all of her love
She's a maneater, make you buy cars, make you cut cards
Make you fall real hard in love
She's a maneater, make you work hard, make you spend hard
Make you want all of her love
She's a maneater, make you buy cars, make you cut cards
Wish you never ever met her at all
Come on now
Maneater, make you work hard, make you spend hard
Make you want all of her love
She's a maneater, make you buy cars, make you cut cards
Make you fall real hard in love
She's a maneater, make you work hard, make you spend hard
Make you want all of her love
She's a maneater, make you buy cars, make you cut cards
Wish you never ever met her at all
No, never ever met her at all
(What you sayin' girl?)
You wish you'd never ever met her at all
(What you sayin' girl?)
You wish you'd never ever met her at all
(What you sayin' girl?)
You wish you'd never ever met her at all
(Come on!)
You wish you'd never ever met her at all
(What you sayin' girl?)
You wish you'd never ever met her at all
(What you sayin' girl?)
You wish you'd never ever met her at all
(What you sayin' girl?)
You wish you'd never ever met her at all
I been around the world I ain't ever seen a girl like this
She's a maneater, a maneater
I been around the world I ain't ever seen a girl like this
She's a maneater, a maneater
I been around the world I ain't ever seen a girl like this
She's a maneater, a maneater
I been around the world I ain't ever seen a girl like this
