Verse 1
I hate the way that you play with my emotions
How you got me open
Still I give all my devotion
Making me feel I'm just some little token
Boy do you have me smoking
Cause I've never felt a high like this before
Hook 
I try to hold it in
Focus in
Cope with it
I always feel I'm suffering 
I'm loving him
But I'm stuck with him 
And I?m? drowning in my own rage
Can we just get back on the same page
Soo?..
Chorus  
Please don't take this personal but you make me sick but?
You make me sick, you make me sick, you make me sick
Make me feel like pulling my hair out and throwing a fit (throwing a fit) x2
But there's something you need to know 
Baby I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
It's killing me to say, boy 
Baby I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
But you make me sick 
Verse 2
I try to ignore you 
Don't want to do nothing for you
But then I really adore you 
Can't be done
When I'm feening and weaning 
There you go intervening 
Baby you got my screaming
At the top of my lungs
Hook
I try to hold it in
Focus in
Cope with it
I always feel I'm suffering 
I'm loving him
But I'm stuck with him 
Drowning in my own rage
Can we just get back on the same page
Soo?
Chorus  
Please don't take this personal but you make me sick but?
You make me sick, you make me sick, you make me sick
Make me feel like pulling my hair out and throwing a fit (throwing a fit) x2
But there's something you need to know 
Baby I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
It's killing me to say, boy 
Baby I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
But you make me sick 
Verse 3
Wish I could kick it like a cigarette (ooh)
Drop you like a bad habit (ooh)
Boy you got me tangled up in your net 
And your loves got me so upset
I'm trapped in your funhouse 
Boy you got me burning out
And I can't find no escape 
I'm poisoned by your love 
My poor heart can't get enough 
OoO 
You make me sick
Chorus  
Please don't take this personal but you make me sick but?
You make me sick, you make me sick, you make me sick
Make me feel like pulling my hair out and throwing a fit (throwing a fit) x2
But there's something you need to know 
Baby I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
It's killing me to say, boy 
Baby I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
But you make me sick, make me sick
