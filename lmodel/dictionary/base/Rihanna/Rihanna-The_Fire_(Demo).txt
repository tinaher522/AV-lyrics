Mmmmm mmmmm
Knocking on your heart again,
Its dark out here please say you'll let me in
Iv?e been outside here once before
So close to the fire is where I get burned
Ayo
Give me love or  give me death
Just don't put me in the fire with the rest
You'll love me now and leave me on
To that furnace where you reckless heart belongs
Something felt strange when you went and said goodbye
Shoulda known when I saw the letters on the ground
Said you did return
But you never turned around
Now I'm stuck here and left here to burn burn burn burn
Away forever all my breath
Till you come back tell your broken promises
Give me love or give me death
Just don't put in the fire with rest
(Just don't put in the fire with rest)
Smoking - Mokin lots of flames
The ground is dry 
And thers no sign of rain
I'ts spreadin' faster than the plague
I'm hopin' that these tears with save me
Give me love or  give me death
Just dont put me in the fire with the rest
You'll love me now leave me on
Till that furnace where you reckless heart belongs
Something felt strange when you went and said goodbye
Shoulda known when I saw the letters on the ground
Said you did return
But you never turned around
Now I'm stuck here and left here to burn burn burn burn
Away forever all my breath
Till you come back tell your broken promises
Give me love or give me death
Just don't put in the fire with rest
(Just don't put me in the fire with the rest )
(Don't put me in the fire with restt)
(Just don't be put me in the fire with the ressstt )
