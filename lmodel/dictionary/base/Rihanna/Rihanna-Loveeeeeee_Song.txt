[Future]
Ain't nothing wrong with it
I don't wanna give you the wrong impression
I need love and affection
And I hope I'm not sounding too desperate
I need love and affection
Love, love, love, love and affection
Love, love, love and affection
[Rihanna]
Oh baby, I'm not asking for the world, maybe
You can give me what I want
Baby come hold me tight 
And when I'm drowning save me
Give it to me on the daily
If I'm your girl say my name boy
Let me know I'm in control
We both grown so how we feel 
We can let it show
I I I, won't play around
I I I, I wanna lay you down
I I I, I need you now 
I need you now oh oh
[Future]
I don't wanna give you the wrong impression
I need love and affection
And I hope I'm not sounding too desperate
I need love and affection
Love, love, love, love and affection
Love, love, love and affection
[Rihanna]
Boy lately, you been stingy with your time
Got me wondering, I'm wondering if I'm on your mind
Boy I just wanna be in your possession
You say I'm the one you want so come express it
Don't slip, don't slip
'Cause a nigga might push up on it
Don't really wanna lose this moment
While window shopping you own this
I I I, don't put it down
I I I, don't fuck around
I I I, I want you now
I want you now oh
[Future]
I don't wanna give you the wrong impression
I need love and affection 
And I hope I'm not sounding too desperate
I need love and affection
Love, love, love, love and affection
Love, love, love and affection
[Future]
Can you love me for poor?
I'll set you for my soul
Whoever turned you cold
You need to let him know
I can work miracles
I'll work your physical
And when I love you close
You can feel my heart beating
Through my clothes
Future
I don't wanna give you the wrong impression
I need love and affection
And I hope I'm not sounding too desperate
I need love and affection
Love, love, love, love and affection
Love, love, love and affection
