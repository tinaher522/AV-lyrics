<song artist="Rihanna" title="Should_I?">
Boy you standin real close to me 
Tell me now what its gunna be 
You like what u see 
But lovin dont come easily 
Now your whipserin in my ear 
All the things that i wanna hear 
Let me make it very clear 
Words are not enough for me 
Did you think that you could smile and steal my heart away? 
Cant deny i like your style 
But it just dont work that way 
(chorus) 
Oooh 
Im kinda feelin you right now 
You keep me standin tight now 
Its gettin hard to fight now 
Still i wonder when should i 
Oooh 
U know they're playin my song now 
U know ur turnin me on now 
The feelings gettin strong now 
Still i wonder when should i 
Back n forth 
Baby round n round 
So high that i cant come down 
Its to late to turn back now 
Still im scared to loose control 
Feel the heat burnin like the sun 
Feel the beat as we move as one 
Dont stop till the night is done 
Hold me close boy 
Dont let go 
Still i got to know if this is real or just a dream 
Because in the mornin my true love is what i wanna see 
Oooh 
Im kinda feelin you right now 
You keep me standin tight now 
Its gettin hard to fight now 
Still i wonder when should i 
Oooh
