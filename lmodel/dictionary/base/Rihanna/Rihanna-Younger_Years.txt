-verse 1- 
[Rihanna]
I Remember when the world was just me and my mama
All i waited for was to wear my dresses in the summer
Nothing else seemed that important to me 
After all i was only young you see 
Now im growing up to become another little woman
Hopefully its a new start and a new beginnig
Im not so innocent now
I got big things ahead of me now
I remember when we used to play kids chase
Didnt have to worry about getting them straight A's
Life was simple then
Life was life was life was simple then
I remember when we used to play mommies and daddies 
The biggest beef that we had would be who is the mommies  
Woahh life was simple then 
Life was life was life was simple then
-Chorus-

I miss them younger years primary school free time
I even miss listening to story time
These are the days that will never get back 
When we were painting pictures and we just kick back
[Rihanna]
Those younger years primary school free time
I even miss listening to story time
Those are the days that will never get back
When we were painting pictures when we just kick back

Look at me now next year il be 16
But i still look back at primary school life and its routines
Tuesdays first lesson always were abit of maths 
And at the end we went over made sure we learnt all the task's 
Learning objectives for thursdays were
To complete abit more on forces and made sure we knew what we learnt
Most lunchtimes all we did was play family had
These memories were all happy not one single sad,
But there are a couple of sad ones that i keep in my heart
Rest in peace hugo god took our friendship apart
Its been 8 years but im still pondering why it happend
Why your so far away its like earth too saturn
Although your gone you will never be forgotten 
The love i have for you hugo that will never rotten
So yeh these are a few things from my younger years
As you can see it wern't all happy times there were a couple of tears
-chorus-

I miss them younger years primary school free time
I even miss listening to story time
These are the days that will never get back 
When we were painting pictures and we just kick back

What am i gonna do now 
Times ticking and its moving on
Im growing older hopefully wiser
And time will tell
Reminiscing back on them old days 
When life was easy thats what pleased me
[ScarFace]
We used to swing on them swings and slide on them slides
But as i got older its just been money on my mind 
But i wanna go back to them simpler days 
When life itself didn't feel like a maze 
The one thing i miss about it all is nursery 
When everyday all we did was revise the a-b-c
Memories like this i know that il miss
Nothing we can do now but sit back and reminisce
-chorus-
