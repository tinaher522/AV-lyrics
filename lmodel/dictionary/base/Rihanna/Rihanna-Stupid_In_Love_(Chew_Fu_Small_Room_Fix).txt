Stupid in love
Oh, stupid in love
Let me tell you something
Never have I ever been a size 10 in my whole life
I left the engine running, I just came to see
What you would do if I gave you a chance to make things right
So I made it, even though Katy told me this would be nothing
But a waste of time and she was right
Don't understand it, blood on your hands and still you insist
On repeatedly trying to tell me lies and I just don't know why
This is stupid, I'm not stupid
Don't talk to me like I'm stupid
I still love you but I just can't do this
I may be dumb, but I'm not stupid
My new nickname is you idiot
(Such an idiot)
That's what my friends are calling me when they see me yelling into my phone
They tellin' me let go, he is not the one
I thought I saw your potential, guess that's what made me dumb
He don't want it, not like you want it, scheming and cheating
Oh girl, why do you waste your time? You know he ain't right
Telling me this I don't wanna listen but you insist on repeatedly trying to tell me lies
And I just don't know why
This is stupid, I'm not stupid
Don't talk to me like I'm stupid
(Stupid in love)
I still love you but I just can't do this
I may be dumb, but I'm not stupid
Trying to make this work, but you act like a jerk
Silly of me to keep holding on
But the dunce cap is off, you don't know what you lost
And you wont realize 'til I'm gone, gone, gone
That I was the one, which one of us is really done?
No, no, no, no
I'm not stupid in love
This is stupid, I'm not stupid
Don't talk to me like I'm stupid
I still love you but I just can't do this
I may be dumb, but I'm not stupid
I may be dumb but I'm not stupid in love
