Hey june,
Words cannot describe how much i miss you
From our little walks
To our little talks
Im a little shocked
And i need to dock
These feelings that i hold inside
Dear june, its been awhile
Do you have a phone number i can dial?
If i dont get it now i think that i might die, no, no
Im exaggerating, but i dont want to be deteriorating
Ill have a rain cloud and its filled with doubt
And i dont want that so I'll let it out
How i feel about you
If you had my view
It would all seem clear
Like a diamond, my dear
I wish i knew
If you need me too
I'll be by your side
Forever.
Dear june,
Words cannot describe how much i need you
From our little walks
To our little talks
Im a little shocked
And i need to dock
These feelings that i hold inside
From movie scenes
To goodnight dreams
Without a doubt
Just think about
The F-U-T-U-R-E
You radiate like sunshine
And my teddy bear at night time
We can cuddle like penguins do for heat
I know im right this time
I see the light that binds
And i heard it through the grapevine
That you wanted to be mine
I hope that you believe
For sure ill never leave
We'll stick like super glue
Dear june, i love you.
Dear june,
Words cannot describe how much i love you
From our little walks
To our little talks
Im a little shocked
And i need to dock
These feelings that i hold inside
[breakdown]
Dear june,
Words cannot describe how much i love you
From our little walks
To our little talks
Im a little shocked
And i need to dock
These feelings that i hold inside
