<song artist="Rihanna" title="Bitch_I'm_Special">
Mirror, mirror on the wall 
Who's got the most inflated ego of them all?
Thinks he can make a booty call
Thinks he is so loveable
Thinks he is the perfect man, that I should never let go
And that's why I let him go
The first thing he wants in the morning aint you 
Its all about him in the morning baby
You got a boy like I had, using you (a boy like that is using baby)
Let me help you understand sexy grin from ear to ear
Girl if you were inside his head
This is what you'd hear
Ayo you gotta love me(love me)
Bitch I'm special(bitch im special)
I want everybody thinking that I got something else(something else) they don't have
You gotta love me(love me)
Bitch I'm special(bitch im special)
I want everybody thinking that I got something else(something else) they don't have
La da da da da da(4x)
He handled me like merchandise
Hate to admit the down payment was his bedroom eyes (yeah)
Ay then after he passed home base he started to pump the breaks
My heavenly bliss destroyed
He flipped a U-y in my face
I was the grand prize that he hardly had to chase
Said goodbye cause I coulda sworn I heard him say
Ayo you gotta love me(love me)
Bitch I'm special(bitch im special)
I want everybody thinking that I got something else(something else) they don't have
You gotta love me(love me)
Bitch I'm special(bitch im special)
I want everybody thinking that I got something else(something else) they don't have
La da da da da da(4x)
You don't gotta love no selfish man
Let him love on himself
Let him love on himself (yeah)
Let him love someone else 
Let him love someone else
I'm just too good (too good)
He said you gotta love me(love me)
Bitch I'm special(bitch im special)
I want everybody thinking that I got something they don't have
You gotta love me(love me)
Bitch I'm special(bitch im special)
I want everybody thinking that I got something they don't have
Bitch
