<song artist="Rihanna" title="Sleeping_With_The_Enemy_(Demo)">
I'm in the
For in place
With the nerd
Lock away
There's no where
In this space
Everything that i've known
Has been erase
Is it a fiction of
My imagination
Or could i be losing my mind
This illusion has got me in a situation im feeling like im trap in time 
In time
This just cant be love
Feels like the strangers
Tearing me apart
Torching my heart
This just cant be love
What happen to us
There is no more trust
This don't feel like love
Im sleeping with the enemy, enemy, enemy
Im sleeping with the enemy, enemy, enemy
Im sleeping with the enemy, enemy, enemy
Im sleeping with the enemy, enemy, enemy
He's asleep
Im a wake
His heartbeats
My heart breaks
The same hands
The same face
Some how love disappear with no trace
Is it a fiction of
My imagination
Or could i be living a lie
This illusion has got me in a situation im feeling like im trap in time 
Time
(2x)this just cant be love
Feels like the strangers
Tearing me apart
Torching my heart
This just cant be love
What happen to us
There is no more trust
This don't feel like love
Im sleeping with the enemy, enemy, enemy
Im sleeping with the enemy, enemy, enemy
Im sleeping with the enemy, enemy, enemy
Im sleeping with the enemy, enemy, enemy
