<song artist="Rihanna" title="Hotness">
(Intro)
I got the hotness (hotness, hotness, hotness)
I got the hotness (hotness)
(Verse 1)
Baby you can call me
Anytime you want me
Hotness Loving you is all I need
Boy we can get it cracking
You can make it happen
Come and get the best of me
Baby watch me &amp; step up
You don't want to mess up
Baby it'd be cool if we could see
'Cause baby (baby) you got (you got) the fires that I remedy
(Bridge)
It's too hot
You don't have to stick around baby
You got
Something I been thinkin' about lately
Don't stop
Spitting up the game to send me crazy
You know how to get it babe, baby come and get it babe
(Chorus) 
I got the hotness
Boy if you want this
You should come &amp; go with me
Rihanna Boy when I drop this
No way to stop this
I got everything you need
Baby I got this
Think you can rock this
Tell me whats it gonna be
I got the hotness
Boy if you want this, baby you should talk to me
(Verse 2)
Baby we can ride out
Go somewhere and hide out
Far away from everything
We ain't gotta tell nobody
We can just get it poppin'
Baby come be next to me
Baby what you got
Can't nobody take it, no
It's on loud

Baby you know you can get it
So baby (baby) take me (take me) 
to a place where we can be alone
(Bridge)
It's too hot
You don't have to stick around baby
You got
Something I been thinkin' about lately
Don't stop
Hotness Spitting up the game to send me crazy
You know how to get it babe baby come and get it babe
(Chorus)
I got the hotness
Boy if you want this you should come &amp; go with me
Boy when I drop this no way to stop this
I got everything you need
Baby I got this think you can rock this tell me whats it gonna be
I got the hotness
Boy if you want this baby you should talk to me
