<song artist="Rihanna" title="The_Last_Time">
Once was a time you and i 
Made a promise till the day we die 
I trusted each and every word 
Never thinkin that I'd get burned 
Silly me I believed in your fairy tales 
Boy i thought that i knew you so very well 
But you walked on my pride all the tears that i cried 
And it cuts like a knife 
(Hook)
Its the last time your ever gunna kiss these lips 
Or ever will decieve these eyes 
Believe me when i tell you this 
Baby boy its the last time 
Im ever gunna cry these tears 
Im never gunna hear your lies 
So listen while i make it clear 
In case you didnt hear 
This times the last time 
Theres no time 
To give it one more try 
Theres only time to say goodbye 
Fooled me once shame on you 
Fooled me twice now this song is through 
The things you said i can never forget 
The things you did for my heart went through bad 
But im still standin tall as i walk away 
And you know that its true when you hear me say 
Its over, its through 
And nothin you can do boy its sad but its true 
(Hook)
Its the last time your ever gunna kiss these lips 
Or ever will decieve these eyes 
Believe me when i tell you this 
Baby boy its the last time 
Im ever gunna cry these tears 
Im never gunna hear your lies 
So listen while i make it clear 
In case you didnt hear 
This times the last time 
Theres no time 
To give it one more try 
Theres only time to say goodbye 
Good Byeee No Baby 
Silly me i believed in your fairy tales 
Boy i thought that i knew you so very well 
But you walked on my pride all the tears that i cried 
And it cuts..like a knife 
(Hook)
Its the last time your ever gunna kiss these lips (ever gonna kiss these lips) 
Or ever will decieve these eyes 
Believe me when i tell you this 
Baby boy its the last time 
Im ever gunna cry these tears 
Im never gunna hear your lies (never gonna hear your lies) 
So listen while i make it clear 
In case you didnt hear 
This times the last time 
Theres no time 
To give it one more try 
Its over its through nothin you can do and wonder why 
Theres only time to say goodbye 
Baby goodbye 
Never gunna never gunna cry no more 
Goodbye goodbye
