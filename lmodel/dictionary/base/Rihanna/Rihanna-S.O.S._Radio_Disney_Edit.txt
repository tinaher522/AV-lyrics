La la la, la la la, la la la la la, oh
(You know, I've never felt like this before)
Oh oh
La la la, la la la, la la la la la, oh
(This feeling's like so real)
Oh oh
I'm obsessive when just one thought of you comes up
And I'm aggressive, just one thought ain't close enough
You got me stressing, incessantly pressing the issue
'Cause every moment gone you know I miss you
I'm the answer and you're of course the question
Talk to me boy, I listen to suggestions
I'm goin' crazy now, so amazing
And I don't know what to do, got me calling out for you
S.O.S, please someone help me
It's not healthy for me to feel this
Y-O-U are making this hard
I can't take it, see it don't feel right
S.O.S, please someone help me
It's not healthy for me to feel this
Y-O-U are making this hard
You got me tossing and turning can't sleep at night
This time please someone come and rescue me
'Cause you on my mind has got me losing it
I'm lost, you got me looking for the rest of me
Love is testing me but still I'm losing it
This time please someone come and rescue me
'Cause you on my mind has got me losing it
I'm lost you got me looking for the rest of me
Got the best of me, so now I'm losing it
Just your presence and I second guess my sanity
Yes, it's a lesson, it's unfair, you stole my vanity
My tummy's up in knots, do you love me, do you not?
My common sense is out the door, can't seem to find the lock
Take on me, uh huh, you know inside you feel it right
Listen up and let me tell you all my dreams tonight
Can't deny you got me head over heels
Boy you keep me hanging on the way you make me feel
S.O.S, please someone help me
It's not healthy for me to feel this
Y-O-U are making this hard
You got me tossing and turning can't sleep at night
This time please someone come and rescue me
'Cause you on my mind has got me losing it
I'm lost, you got me looking for the rest of me
Love is testing me but still I'm losing it
This time please someone come and rescue me
'Cause you on my mind has got me losing it
I'm lost, you got me looking for the rest of me
Got the best of me, so now I'm losing it
Boy, you know my head is spinning it's true
And boy, you know I'm only thinking of you
I said boy, you're telling me what I never knew
I don't know what to say it's true
I'm going crazy over you, I'm begging
S.O.S, please someone help me
It's not healthy for me to feel this
Y-O-U are making this hard
You got me tossing and turning can't sleep at night
This time please someone come and rescue me
'Cause you on my mind has got me losing it
I'm lost, you got me looking for the rest of me
Love is testing me but still I'm losing it
This time please someone come and rescue me
'Cause you on my mind has got me losing it
I'm lost, you got me looking for the rest of me
Got the best of me, so now I'm losing it
La la la, la la la, la la la la la, oh
Oh oh
La la la, la la la, la la la la la, oh
Oh oh
