[Rihanna:]
Story Of My Life
Searching For The Right
But It Keeps Avoiding Me
Sorrow In My Soul
Cause It Seems That Wrong
Really Loves My Company
He's More Than A Man
And This Is More Than Love
The Reason That The Sky Is Blue
But Clouds Are Rolling In
Because I'm Gone Again
And To Him I Just Can't Be True
And I Know That He Knows I'm Unfaithful
And It Kills Him Inside
To Know That I Am Happy With Some Other Guy
I Can See Him Dying
I Don't Wanna Do This Anymore
I Don't Wanna Be The Reason Why
Everytime I Walk Out The Door
I See Him Die A Little More Inside
I Don't Wanna Hurt Him Anymore
I Don't Wanna Take Away His Life
I Don't Wanna Be...
A Murderer
[T.I.:]
Candy on the six- foes
Leather gutters as a fish-bowl
50 inch on the pinky ring 
JUst to make my fist glow
A
Because I get low
A
Because I get dough 
A
Because I get hoes
A
Because that shit is getting old.
Our Love, His Trust
I Might As Well Take A Gun And Put It To His Head
Get It Over With
I Don't Wanna Do This
[Rihanna:]
I Don't Wanna Do This Anymore
I Don't Wanna Be The Reason Why
And Everytime I Walk Out The Door
I See Him Die A Little More Inside
And I Don't Wanna Hurt Him Anymore
I Don't Wanna Take Away His Life
I Don't Wanna Be...
A Murderer 
Baby Thats What You Are,
Baby Thats What You Are,
Baby Thats What You Are,
Baby Thats What You Are,
Baby Thats What You Are,
Baby Thats What You Are,
Baby Thats What You Are,
Baby Thats What You Are,
Baby Thats What You Are,
No No No No
Yeah Yeah Yeah
