Yeah, hey
Oh
That's how much I love you
(Yeah)
That's how much I need you
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, ah)
And I can't stand ya
Almost everything you do
Makes me wanna smile
Even I like you for a while
(No, oh)
But you won't let me
You upset me, girl
And then you kiss my lips
All of a sudden I forget
(That I was upset)
Can't remember what you did
But I hate it
You know exactly what to do
So that I can't stay mad at you
For too long, that's wrong
But I hate it
You know exactly how to touch
So that I don't want to fuss and fight no more
Said I despise that I adore you
And I hate how much I love you, boy
(Yeah)
I can't stand how much I need you
(I need you)
And I hate how much I love you, boy
(Ooh whoa)
But I just can't let you go
And I hate that I love you so
(Ooh)
And you completely know
The power that you have
The only one that makes me laugh
Said that it's not fair
How you take advantage of the fact
That I love you beyond the reason why
(Why)
And it just ain't right
And I hate how much I love you, girl
I can't stand how much I need you
(Yeah)
And I hate how much I love you, girl
But I just can't let you go
But I hate that I love you so
One of these days
Maybe your magic won't affect me
And your kiss won't make me weak
But no one in this world knows me
The way you know me
So you'll probably always have a spell on me
Yeah
Ooh
As much I love you
(As much as I need you, oh)
As much as I need you
(Ooh, as so much I love you)
As much I love you
(Oh)
As much as I need you
And I hate
That I love you so
And I hate that I love you so
And I hate how much I love you, boy
I can't stand how much I need ya
(Can't stand how much I need you)
And I hate how much I love you, boy
But I just can't let you go
(But I just can't let you go, no)
And I hate that I love you so
And I hate that I love you so, so
