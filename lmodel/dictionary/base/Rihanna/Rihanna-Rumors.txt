<song artist="Rihanna" title="Rumors">
Saturday steppin' into the club
Music make me just wanna tell the DJ to
Turn It Up
I feel the energy all around
And my body can't stop moving to the sound
But can't tell that you're watching me
And you're probably gonna write what you didn't see
Well I just need a little space to breath
Can you please respect my privacy
Why can't you just let me 
Do the things I wanna do
I just wanna be me 
I don't understand why
Would you wanna bring me down
I'm only having fun
I'm gonna live my life
But not the way you want me to
CHORUS:
I'm tired of rumors starting
I'm sick of being followed
I'm tired of people lying
Saying what they want about me
Why can't they back up off me
Why can't they let me live
I'm gonna do it my way
Take this for just what it is
Here we are back up in the club
People taking pictures
Like they can't get enough
I just wanna be all over the floor
And throw my hands up in the air to a beat like (What?)
I gotta say respectfully
I would love it if you take the cameras off of me
'Cause I just need a little room to breathe
Can you please respect my privacy
Why can't you just let me 
Do the things I wanna do
I just wanna be me
I don't understand why
Would you wanna bring me down
I'm only having fun
I'm gonna live my life
But not the way you want me to
[CHORUS:]
I'm tired of rumors starting
I'm sick of being followed
I'm tired of people lying
Saying what they want about me
Why can't they back up off me
Why can't they let me live
I'm gonna do it my way
Take this for just what it is
I just need to free my mind (my mind)
Just wanna dance and have a good time (good time)
I'm tired of rumors (rumors, rumors)
Followed (followed, followed, followed, followed, followed)
What they (follow) me
Why can't they (they they they-they-they) let me live
Take this for just what it is
CHORUS:
I'm tired of rumors starting
I'm sick of being followed
I'm tired of people lying
Saying what they want about me
Why can't they back up off me
Why can't they let me live
I'm gonna do it my way
Take this for just what it is
I'm tired of rumors starting
I'm sick of being followed
I'm tired of people lying
Saying what they want about me
Why can't they back up off me
Why can't they let me live
I'm gonna do it my way
Take this for just what it is
