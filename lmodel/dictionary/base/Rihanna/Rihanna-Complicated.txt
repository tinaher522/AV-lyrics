<song artist="Rihanna" title="Complicated">
You're not easy to love
You're not easy to love, no-oh
You're not easy to love
You're not easy to love, no-oh
Why is everything, with you so complicated?
Why do you make it hard to love you?
Oh I hate it
'Cause if you really wanna be alone, I,
Would throw my hands up cause baby I tried
But everything with you is so complicated,
Oh why? (Oh why)
Sometimes I get you, sometimes I don't understand.
Sometimes I love you, sometimes it's you I can't stand.
Sometimes I wanna hug you, sometimes I wanna push you away.
Most times I wanna kiss you, other times punch you in the face
And every minute you start switching up
And you say things like, "You don't give a fuck!"
Then I say, "I'm through with you." Take my heart from you. 
And you come running after me, and, baby, I'm back with you.
Oh
You're not easy to love
You're not easy to love, no-oh
You're not easy to love
You're not easy to love, no-oh
Why is everything, with you so complicated?
Why do you make it hard to love you?
Oh I hate it
'Cause if you really wanna be alone, I
Would throw my hands up cause baby I tried
But everything with you is so complicated,
Oh why? (Oh why)
Sometimes I catch you, Sometimes you get away
Sometimes I read you, Other times I'm like, 'Where are you on the page?'
Sometimes I feel like we will be together for---ever
But you're so complicated my heart knows better
Why is everything with you so complicated?
Why do you make it hard to love you?
Oh I ha---te it
Cause if you really wanna be alone, I
Would throw my hands up cause baby I tried
But everything with you is so complicated,
Oh, why (Oh Why)
I'mma stick around just a little while longer.
Just to make sure, that you're really sure, you like sleeping alone
I'mma stick around just a little while longer.
Just to make sure, that you're really sure, you like sleeping alone
Why is everything, with you so complicated?
Why do you make it hard to love you?
Oh I hate it
'Cause if you really wanna be alone, I
Would throw my hands up cause baby I tried
But everything with you is so complicated,
Oh why? (Oh why)
You're not easy to love
You're not easy to love, no-oh
You're not easy to love
You're not easy to love, no-oh
