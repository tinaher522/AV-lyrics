<song artist="Rihanna" title="Hate_That_I_Love_You_(Spanglish)">
That's how much I love you
That's how much I need you
And I can't stand ya
Most everything you do make me wanna smile
Can I not like it for a while?
No, but you won't let me
You upset me, girl, and then you kiss my lips
All of a sudden I forget that I was upset
Can't remember what you did
But I hate it
You know exactly what to do
So that I can't stay mad at you
For too long, that's wrong
But, I hate it
You know exactly how to touch
So that I don't wanna fuss and fight no more
Said, I despise that I adore you
And I hate how much I love you, boy
I can't stand how much I need you
And I hate how much I love you, boy
But I just can't let you go
And I hate that I love you so
And you completely know the power that you have
The only one that makes me laugh
Sad and it's not fair how you take advantage of the fact
That I love you beyond the reason why
And it just ain't right
And I hate how much I love you, girl
I can't stand how much I need you
And I hate how much I love you, girl
But I just can't let you go
But I hate that I love you so
One of these days, maybe your magic won't affect me
And your kiss won't make me weak
But no one in this world knows me the way you know me
So you'll probably always have a spell on me, yay
That's how much I love you
That's how much I need you
That's how much I love you
That's how much I need you
And I hate that I love you so
And I hate how much I love you, boy
I can't stand how much I need you
And I hate how much I love you, girl
But I just can't let you go
But I hate that I love you so
And I hate that I love you so, so
