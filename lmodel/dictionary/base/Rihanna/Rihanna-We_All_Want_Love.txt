<song artist="Rihanna" title="We_All_Want_Love">
We all, we all, we all, we all, we all
We all, we all, we all, we all, we all
I can pretend that I'm not lonely but
I'll be constantly fooling myself
I can pretend that it don't matter but
I'll be sitting here lyin' to myself
Some say love ain't worth a buck but I'll give every dime I have left
To have what I've only
Been dreaming about
Everybody wants something
Gotta want something
What are you living for?
Everybody needs something
Fightin' for something
I know what you're fighting for
'Cause we all
We all want someone there to hold
We just want somebody
We all wanna be somebody's one and only
We all wanna be warm when it's cold
No one wants to be left scared and lonely
We all, we all, we all, we all, we all
We all want the same thing
We all, we all, we all, we all, we all
We all want the same thing
We all, we all, we all, we all, we all
We all want the same thing
Everybody wants something
Gotta want something
Yeah, yeah, we all want love
I'm able to close my eyes yet my heart's not so blind
I feel so entitled, love owes me, I want what's mine
And some say love ain't worth a buck but I'll give my last dime
To have what I've only
Been dreaming about
Everybody wants something
Gotta want something
What are you living for?
Everybody needs something
Fightin' for something
I know what you're fighting for
'Cause we all
We all want someone there to hold
We just want somebody
We all wanna be somebody's one and only
We all wanna be warm when it's cold
No one wants to be left scared and lonely
We all, we all, we all, we all, we all
We all want the same thing
We all, we all, we all, we all, we all
We all want the same thing
We all, we all, we all, we all, we all
We all want the same thing
Everybody wants something
Gotta want something
Yeah, yeah, we all want love
