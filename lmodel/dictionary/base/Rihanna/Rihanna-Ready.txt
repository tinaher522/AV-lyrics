<song artist="Rihanna" title="Ready">
Heyy yeahh ahha
I don't think your ready
Think your ready oh no
But ima ready but ima ready
Ima ready for sho [x2]
I mean what can i say
I'm cooler them cool not to be cocky
You can learn if you just watch me
I i i i
Im fresher then fresh
One step ahead of the rest
Two steps ahead of whoever you thought was best
So really though oh oh
So many things to me are minor but you make
Em major in moving fast
If ya'll ain't catching up
Ill see ya later
Im on a higher level
You can see me up in the ayer ayer
I dont think you ready
Ima bout to do something different
Ya im about to flip it and switch
If you gonna remember this
I don't think your ready
Think your ready oh no
But ima ready but ima ready
Ima ready for sho
As i walk to the back
I can hear them scream and shout
Like oh like oh
As i stand in the back
I can hear the bass smack
Like oh like oh
My swagas right but i dont need it
I know you doubt it
Thats just how you feel about it
I dont need your confermatioon
I dont need your ok
We wear leggings nerdy glasses
And different colored skinny jeans
Can ou feel it
You feel it ya
I can see that you stare
All the things that i wear
She aint from around hear aha
Im on a higher level
You can see me up in the ayer ayer
In the ayer
I dont think you ready
Ima bout to do something different
Ya im about to flip it and switch
If you gonna remember this
I don't think your ready
Think your ready oh no
But ima ready but ima ready
Ima ready for sho
As i walk to the back
I can hear them scream and shout
Like oh like oh
As i stand in the back
I can hear the bass smack
Like oh like oh
[RAP]
I dont think you ready
Ima bout to do something different
Ya im about to flip it and switch
If you gonna remember this
I don't think your ready
Think your ready oh no
But ima ready but ima ready
Ima ready for sho
As i walk to the back
I can hear them scream and shout
Like oh like oh
As i stand in the back
I can hear the bass smack
Like oh like oh
