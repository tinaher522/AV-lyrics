(feat. The-Dream)
Woah oh woah oh, Woah oh woah oh
[Verse 1:]
Now this will be the last time you did me wrong
No more layin up in your arms
No callin sayin you want me back
I'm packing mah bags wat you think about dat?
[Hook:]
I stayed at home like a good girl do
But tonite, baby you got me sad and blue
I just heard bout the girl in your car
Ya'll kissing at the bar
Got me cry-y-y-ing
[Chorus:]
Wooooah you got me hatin on the club
Cause it took my love
Oh you took my love
And now you got me like
Woah you got me hatin on the club
Cause you took my love
Why'd you had to take my love?
Wooah
Woah oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Woah oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Woah oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oooh uh oh uh oh uh oh oh
[Verse 2:]
And you can be mad at me all you want
I ain't coming in I'll be waiting out front
Coming out the door with your girlfriend
You did me wrong boy tell me where our love went
[Hook:]
I stayed at home like the good girls do
But tonite, baby you got me sad and blue
I just heard bout the girl in your car
Ya'll kissing at the bar
Got me cry-y-y-ing
[Chorus:]
Wooooah you got me hatin on the club
Cause it took my love
Oh you took my love
And now you got me like
Woah you got me hatin on the club
Cause you took my love
Why'd you had to take my love?
Wooah
Woah oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Woah oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Woah oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oooh uh oh uh oh uh oh oh
[Bridge:]
Now this is the sound of a broken heart
It's only one reason why we're apart
She never would've made it to your car
If it wasn't for the club
I'd still have my love
I'd still have my love
We would still have us
We would still have us
I'd still have my love
I'd still have my love
We would still have us
But now and now I'm like
[Chorus:]
Wooooah you got me hatin on the club
You took my love
Oh you took my love
But now and now I'm like
Woah you got me hatin on the club
You took my love
Oh you took my love
Wooah
[The-Dream:]
Oh oh oh
You got her hatin
Woah you got her hatin on the
You got her hatin
Woah you got her hatin on the
You got her hatin
Woah you got her hatin on the club club club club
You got her hatin
Woah you got her hatin on the
You got her hatin
Woah you got her hatin on the
