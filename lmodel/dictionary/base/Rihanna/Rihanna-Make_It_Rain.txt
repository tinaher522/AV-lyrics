<song artist="Rihanna" title="Make_It_Rain">
She comes by my place tonight
We gonna do the same thing we did last night
Make her feel good in my home
I got enough place for 2
Can't belive it, did she really knock my door?
Checkin' from the bed, then I say who's there?
She said Baby what's up I want some more
Can't belive it tonight
Wooo, yeah, come on
Jump in here, make it hot right now
Stop on here, make it hot right now
Come on make it rain
Make it rain boy, make it rain boy
I want you to say my name, bring it low, bring it low
Bring it low, bring it low, e-e-e-ee-eee bring it low (4x)
Make it rain boy, make it rain boy (2x)
I love my girls, that bad girls
Baby just relax, take it off, sit down
I got the night, change off,  heeey
Girl, girl, try out me, you know I got what you need, 
So girl jump on me
I want you to say my name, bring it low (3x)
E-e-e-eee-eee, bring it low (3x)
Make it rain boy, make it rain boy
Make it rain boy, make it rain boy
