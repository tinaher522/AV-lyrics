<song artist="Rihanna" title="Why_Am_I_So_In_Love?">
Chris Brown:
You know what I'm thinkin'
You know that its you,
But some things need perfection,
Unlike you,
Chris Brown and Rihanna:
So why am I so in love?
Your the best thing in my life and always will be
Rihanna:
I'm so glad your mine,
You mean the world to me,
Chris Brown:
Your like a summers day,
Both:
I asked for your love,
You gave it to me,
I needed your trust,
The same as can be,
Rihanna:
I thought I would lose you,
But I knew i was wrong,
Chris brown:
So why did it have to happen,
When you sing this song,
Both:
I know my mistakes,
So light as a dove,
I learn from them all,
Why am i so in love,
Rihanna:
'coz i need to know,
Whats in my heart,
Chris Brown:
Like a love,
In my love chart,
Chorus 
Both:
I asked for your love,
You gave it to me,
I needed your trust,
The same as can be,
Repeat chorus
Both:
My love is strong,
Why am I so in love?
