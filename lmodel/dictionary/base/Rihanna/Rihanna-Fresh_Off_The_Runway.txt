<song artist="Rihanna" title="Fresh_Off_The_Runway">
I see you walk
I hear you boy
I see you walk
Love it, then come and get it
I know that ya fuckin' wid it
Ya see me, ya like it, huh?
Heels Givenchy, huh?
Love it, then play it back
Plus where da 40 at?
I'm fucking ya cheap thrill on top of my 50 mill
He eating the cake killa!
He on it, but don't kill her!
My jewellers are diamond rollers!
My rock, chinchilla!
Some more raw fun, I'm rolling like rock stars
Got 50 muthafuckers in my watch with my bands out
Phresh out the runway
Phresh out, phresh out the runway
Phresh, phresh out the runway
Phresh, phresh out the runway
Bitch I'm phresh out the runway
Phresh out, phresh out the runway
Phresh out, phresh out the runway
Phresh out, phresh out the runway
Phresh out the runway
Phresh out, phresh out the runway
Phresh, phresh out the runway
Phresh, phresh out the runway
Bitch I'm phresh out the runway
Phresh out, phresh out the runway
Phresh out, phresh out the runway
Phresh out, phresh out, hold up
Venus I'm outta coast, my bitches don't know
Fuck wit' a Mac designer dip to the fucking flo'
And be out in that, they let them in on them hundred spokes
Monas are rolling loudies, and my bitches so Bugatti
Bodies of Ducati's do what the fuck you want
I bet you niggas gon' be like "bitch dis my fucking song"
How could you be so hood, but you so fucking pop?
How could you be so fun, and sound like you selling rocks?
What's in the chain, dollars
What's on my chain, dollars
All of the bank dollars got change for small dollars
Everything plain dollars
I was in the back line, I'm standing in the bank line,
You throwin' up the gang signs
Phresh out the runway
Phresh out, phresh out the runway
Phresh, phresh out the runway
Phresh, phresh out the runway
Bitch I'm phresh out the runway
Phresh out, phresh out the runway
Phresh out, phresh out the runway
Phresh out, phresh out the runway
Phresh out the runway
Phresh out, phresh out the runway
Phresh, phresh out the runway
Phresh, phresh out the runway
Bitch I'm phresh out the runway
Phresh out, phresh out the runway
Phresh out, phresh out the runway
Phresh out, phresh out, hold up
I bet you wanna know what my crew about
You really wanna know how we get down
Walk up in this bitch like we own this ho
Own this ho, like we own this ho
I bet you wanna know what I'm all about
You really wanna know how I get down
Walk up in this bitch like I own the ho
I own a ho
Phresh out the runway
Phresh out, phresh out the runway
Phresh, phresh out the runway
Phresh, phresh out the runway
Bitch I'm phresh out the runway
Phresh out, phresh out the runway
Phresh out, phresh out the runway
Phresh out, phresh, phresh, phresh, phresh
Phresh out the runway
Phresh out, phresh out the runway
Phresh, phresh out the runway
Phresh, phresh out the runway
Bitch I'm phresh out the runway
Phresh out, phresh out the runway
Phresh out, phresh out the runway
Phresh out, phresh out, hold up
Phresh out, phresh out the runway
Phresh, phresh out the runway
Phresh, phresh out the runway
Bitch I'm phresh out the runway

Phresh out, phresh out, phresh out
Phresh out the runway
