<song artist="Rihanna" title="Drunk_On_Love">
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, no
I feel like I'm a hopeless romantic
I can't help falling in love
I fiend for love, I want it I crave it
I just can't get enough
Take me away, 
I'll wear my heart on my sleeve
Always let love take the lead
I'm maybe a little naive, yeah
You know I'm 
Drunk on love
Drunk on love
Nothing can sober me up
It's all that I need
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
I've been let down but never been tainted
So I stay thirsty for more
No I won't hold back no drop is wasted
I let love run it's cours
Take me away, 
I'll wear my heart on my sleeve
Always let love take the lead
I'm maybe a little naive, yeah
You know I'm 
Drunk on love
Drunk on love
Nothing can sober me up
You know I'm 
Drunk on love
Drunk, drunk on love
Nothing can sober me up
It's all that I need
I'm so intoxicated
I learned the way you taste
On my lips when we kiss
You got me so addicted
So much I can't resist
Falling into your arms
Take me away, 
I'll wear my heart on my sleeve
Always let love take the lead
I'm maybe a little naive, yeah
You know I'm 
Drunk on love
Drunk on love
Nothing can sober me up
You know I'm 
Drunk on love
Drunk, drunk on love
Nothing can sober me up
It's all that I need
It's all that I need
It's all that I need
