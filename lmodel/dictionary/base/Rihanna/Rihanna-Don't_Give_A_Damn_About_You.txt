<song artist="Rihanna" title="Don't_Give_A_Damn_About_You">
What do i do..it doesn't make sense can i run away..did he have to change his mind..why did he break my heart
What will my friends say..why do i love him anyway didn't i give everything,where did i go wrong??
And i don't understand why did he tell lies why did he waste my time..how could he play games with my heart...
And this is how i feel..i can't beleive that none of this is real...
What do you say when he DON'T GIVE A DAMN ABOUT YOU..don't give a damn about you..don't give a damn about you ..don't give a damn about you.. don't give a damn 
[oooh,oooh,oooh,oooh,ooooh,oooh,oh]

And i don't understand why did he tell lies why did he waste my time...how could he play games with my heart..and this is how i feeeeeeeeeeeeeeel..i can't beleive that none of this is real..
