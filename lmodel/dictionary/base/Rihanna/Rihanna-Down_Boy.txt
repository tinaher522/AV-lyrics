<song artist="Rihanna" title="Down_Boy">
I'm the kinda girl who's something like a diamond
Cost a lot, and it's hard to find one
This is might be a day you won't forget no
I'll have you doing things you won't regret, so
If you wanna see my wild side (Wanna see my wild side)
Here's the rules that apply (Keep your eyes on me all the times)
You gotta let me run the show (I'm a trained professional)
Make him roar, beg for more
Not too much, get down boy
You're used to your way
Boy, it's a new play
Why fight it when you know that you gon' like it
Get down boy
Ju-ju-just enjoy the ride
Fall back but not behind
Why fight it when you know that you gon' like it
Get down boy
Get down, get down
Get down, get down, get down
Get down, get down
Get down, get down, get down
Get down, get down
Seems like you're scared of a challenge
Looks like you're nervous, boy quit all that whinin'
You're not used to one who'll take the time to tame you
Guarantee that you'll be whipped soon as I get through
If you wanna see my wild side (Wanna see my wild side)
Here's the rules that apply (Keep your eyes on me all the times)
You gotta let me run the show (I'm a trained professional)
Make him roar, beg for more
Not too much, get down boy
You're used to your way
Boy, it's a new play
Why fight it when you know that you gon' like it
Get down boy
Ju-ju-just enjoy the ride
Fall back but not behind
Why fight it when you know that you gon' like it
Get down boy
Get down, get down
Get down, get down, get down
Get down, get down
Get down, get down, get down
Get down, get down
I'm gon' throw it back, boy
Cuz you been a bad boy
Teach you tricks and show you how to act
How to act, uh huh huh
(repeat)
You're used to your way
Boy, it's a new play
Why fight it when you know that you gon' like it
Get down boy
Ju-ju-just enjoy the ride
Fall back but not behind
Why fight it when you know that you gon' like it
Get down boy
Get down, get down
Get down, get down, get down
Get down, get down
Get down, get down, get down
Get down, get down
