<song artist="Rihanna" title="Adrenaline_Rush">
We make the crowd go...
Uh,uh,uh,uh!
Wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeen....!
When I step on stage, the crowd starts to shout!
I go up to my girls,I drain da sound out!
But I sing like this and wail like that,
I don't care!Whatcha think about dat?!
Chorus:
The adre-adrenaline rush,shush!
I sing hardcore,not lovey dovey m-m-m-mush
So when ya hear my concert sold out,
Feel free to whine,and p-p-p-pout!
Ashlee:Ohh,when the time is ri-i-i-ight,
I go out in the ni-i-ight,
Should I go free or incognito,
Free, duh! Decide,as easy as pie!
Chorus
Riri:Babe,oh adre-adrenaline-line-line
Oh,burning up in my skin skin skin skin
Ashlee:Babe,I love you so,
Adrenaline rushhhhhhhhhhhh!
Chorus
Adrenaline!
