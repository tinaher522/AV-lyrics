<song artist="Rihanna" title="Don't_Even_Try">
Why do you call when i'm not feelin' you (baby), 
Why can't you leave boy just walk away 
When are you going to understand ohhha.. 
What sort of things they be tellin' you, 
I've got to stop them from compelling you boy, 
They better stop, they're not helping you ohhha... 
Don't even try, cuz i know 
That, you're not the one 
Don't waste your time, 
Goodbye, don'tcha cry, 
The game is done 
I'm gonna tell you right here, 
Let this be the last time 
I'm gonna make it so clear, 
Boy, you must be outcha mind 
I'm gonna tell you right here, 
Let this be the last time 
I'm gonna make it so clear, 
You must be outcha mind 
Don't you lie, don't you try, 
Say goodbye, it just won't work 
Your head's in the sky, must be trippin', 
Must be high, but theres so much I'm worth 
I'm not stupid, I'm not a fool 
I know what I'm doin', I went to school 
You better listen, do what you're told 
My love's more valuable than a pot of gold 
I'm gonna tell you right here, 
Let this be the last time 
I'm gonna make it so clear, 
Boy you must be outcha mind 
I'm gonna tell you right here, 
Let this be the last time 
I'm gonna make it so clear, 
Must be outcha your mind 
Don't even try, cuz I, know that you're not the one 
Don't waste your time, 
Goodbye, don't you cry, 
The game is done 
Don't even try, cuz I, know that you're not the one 
Don't waste your time, 
Goodbye, don't you cry, 
The game is done
