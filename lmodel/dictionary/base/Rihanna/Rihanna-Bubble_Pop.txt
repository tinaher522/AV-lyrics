[Will.I.AM]
Bubble pop, bubble pop, bubble pop,
You make think it's strange or derange how I make it bounce
Sugar sweet just like a candy cane melting in your mouth
Cotton cover lemon drops make it hard I'll make it pop
Once I'll show you how you'll never get enough
[Chorus]
I'll pop my bubble (Hey)
I'll pop my bubble (Hey, hey)
I'll pop my bubble (yeah)
I'll make my bubble pop
For you I'll make it pop
For you, for you I'll make it pop
For you I'll make it pop 
Boy don't be afraid of the way that I captivate
Sticky if you touch it, might get lost and you can't escape
Cherry flavored? yummy yum, boy be nice I'll give you some
Of my tasty cake i know you love soo much
[Chorus]
I'll pop my bubble(Hey) (Hey yeh)
I'll pop my bubble (Hey, hey)
I'll pop my bubble (yeah)
I'll make my bubble pop
I'll pop my bubble (Hey)
I'll pop my bubble (Hey, hey)(yeah)
I'll pop my bubble (yeah)(make it pop make it pop)
I'll make my bubble pop
For you I'll make it pop
For you, for you I'll make it pop
For you I'll make it pop 
Come get lost with me
I dare you to try-ey-yy-ey-yy-ey-yy
Come get lost with me
I dare you to try-ey-yy-ey-yy-ey-yy
[Chorus]
I'll pop my bubble(Hey)
I'll pop my bubble (Hey, hey)
I'll pop my bubble (yeah)
I'll make my bubble pop
I'll pop my bubble(Hey)
I'll pop my bubble (Hey, hey)
I'll pop my bubble (yeah)
I'll make my bubble pop
For you I'll make it pop
For you, for you I'll make it pop
For you
Come get lost with me
I dare you to try-ey-yy-ey-yy-ey-yy
Come get lost with me
I dare you to try-ey-yy-ey-yy-ey-yy
[Chorus]
I'll pop my bubble(Hey)
I'll pop my bubble (Hey, hey)
I'll pop my bubble (yeah)
I'll make my bubble pop
I'll pop my bubble(Hey)
I'll pop my bubble (Hey, hey)
I'll pop my bubble (yeah)
I'll make my bubble pop
For you I'll make it pop
For you, for you I'll make it pop
For you I'll make it pop
For you I'll make it pop
(Bubble pop...)
