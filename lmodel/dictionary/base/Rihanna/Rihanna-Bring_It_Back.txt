Rihanna, bring it back
Oh woah oh no
Oh woah oh no
Mr. dj. coming after you babe
I wanna hear my jam again
Move the crowd now
Play it crazy loud now
Bring it back now if you can
I've been waitin' so long pump it up, put it on, tell me what you waitin' for
Feel it deep in my soul, now it's out of control, i can't take it anymore
Bring it back again
Play my track again
Keep it hot for me
Make my body move
It's all up to you
What's it gonna be
Play my joint again
Play my jam and
Send this one out to me
Bring it back again
It's a fact
I need somethin' that i'm gonna feel
Oh woah oh no (bring it back)
Oh woah oh no
Here we go now
Gotta let you know now
I wanna feel the summer heat
Don't you understand
I don't want a slow jam
I wanna feel the hottest beat
It's my joint, it's my jam, play the record again
The one that turns me on
It's alright, it's okay, i don't care if you play it until the night is done
Bring it back again
Play my track again
Keep it hot for me

Make my body move
It's all up to you
What's it gonna be
Play my joint again
Play my jam and
Send this one out to me
Bring it back again
It's a fact
I need somethin' that i'm gonna feel
Oh woah oh no (bring it back)
Oh woah oh no
Oh woah no
It's my joint, it's my jam, play the record again
Ooh woah
I've been waitin' so long pump it up, put it on, tell me what you waitin' for
Feel it deep in my soul, now it's out of control, i can't take it anymore
Bring it back again
Play my track again
Keep it hot for me
Make my body move
It's all up to you
What's it gonna be
Play my joint again
Play my jam and
Send this one out to me
Bring it back again
It's a fact
I need somethin' that i'm gonna feel
Somethin' that i'm gonna feel
Oh woah oh no (bring it back)
Oh woah oh no (play my song now)
Bring it back again
Play my track again
Keep it hot for me
Make my body move
It's all up to you
What's it gonna be
Play my joint again
Play my jam and
Send this one out to me
Bring it back
