<song artist="Rihanna" title="Te_Amo">
Te amo, te amo she says to me
I hear the pain in her voice
Then we danced underneath the candelabra
She takes the lead
That's when I saw it in her eyes
It's over
Then she said, te amo then she put her hand around me waist
I told her no, she cried te amo
I told her I not gonna run away
But let me go...
My soul hears her cry, without asking why
I said te amo
Wish somebody tell me what she say
Don’t it mean I love you
I think it means I love you
Don’t it mean I love you
Te amo, te amo she's scared to breathe
I hold her hand I got no choice
Pulled me out on the beach danced in the water
I start to leave
She's begging me and asking why?
It’s over...
Then she said, te amo then she put her hand around me waist
I told her no, she cried te amo
I told her I not gonna run away
But let me go...
My soul hears her cry, without asking why
I said te amo
Wish somebody tell me what she say
Don’t it mean I love you
I think it means I love you
Don’t it mean I love you
Listen we can dance
But you gotta watch your hands
Watch me all night,
I'll move under the light
Because I understand
That we all need love
And I’m not afraid
I feel the love but I don't feel that way
Then she said, te amo then she put her hand around me waist
I told her no, she cried te amo
I told her I not gonna run away
But let me go...
My soul hears her cry, without asking why
I said te amo
Wish somebody tell me what she say
Don’t it mean I love you
I think it means I love you
Don’t it mean I love you
I think it means I love you
Te amo, te amo
Don’t it mean I love you
