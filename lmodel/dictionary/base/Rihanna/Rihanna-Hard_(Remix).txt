<song artist="Rihanna" title="Hard_(Remix)">
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ah yeah, yeah, yeah
Ah yeah, yeah, yeah
Ah yeah, yeah, yeah
Ah yeah, ah yeah, ah yeah, ah yeah, ah yeah, yeah
Ah yeah, ah yeah, ah yeah, ah yeah, ah yeah, yeah
They can say whatevah
I'ma do whatevah
No pain is forevah
Yup, you know this
Tougher than a lion
Ain't no need in tryin'
I live where the sky ends
Yup, you know this
Never lyin', truth tella
That Rihanna rain just won't let up
All black on, black top shades
Black top Maybach
I'ma rock this shit like fashion hasn't
Goin' 'til they say stop
And my runway never looked so clear
Put the hottest bitch in heels right here
No fear, and while you're getting your cry on
I'm getting my fly on
Sincere, I see you aimin' at my pedestal
I betta' let ya know
That I-I-I-I'm so hard
Ah yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm so hard
That I-I-I-I'm so hard
Ah yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm so hard
That I-I-I-I'm so hard
Ah yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm so hard
Too hard, too hard, too hard, too hard
(Ah yeah, yeah, yeah)
That Rihanna rain just won't let up
(Ah yeah, yeah, yeah)
That Rihanna rain just won't let up
(Ah yeah, yeah, yeah)
That Rihanna rain just won't let up
Too hard, too hard, too hard, too hard
All up on it, know you want to clone it
Ain't like me, that chick too phony
Ride this beat, beat, beat like a pony
Meet me at the top, top, top
It's gettin' lonely
Who think they test me now?
Run through yo town, I'll shut it down
Brilliant, resilient
Fan mail from 27 million
And I want it all
It's gonna take more than that
Hope that ain't all you got
I need it all, the money, the fame, the cars, the clothes
I can't just let you run up on me like that
All on me like that, yeah
I see you aimin' at my pedestal
So I think I gotta let ya know
That I-I-I-I'm so hard
Ah yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm so hard
That I-I-I-I'm so hard
Ah yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm so hard
That I-I-I-I'm so hard
Ah yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm so hard
Too hard, too hard, too hard, too hard
Go hard or go home, back to your residence
Soon the red dogs get a block back to the presidents
I used to run my old block like Obama did
You don't gotta believe me, go ask my momma then
Couldn't even come in my room, smell like a kilo
Look like me and two of my boys playin' casino
Cali's all I keep in my bag in California
Tell them to give me back my swag, they try to clone me
You see my Louis Chucks, Louis flag, Louis frames
Louis belt
What that make me, Louis Mane?
I'm in the all white party wearin' all black
With my new black watch called the heart attack
Cardiac arrest, cardiac a-wrist
Yeah, they say they hard, they ain't hard as this
Hard! The one word describes me
And if I wasn't doin' this
You know where I be, too hard
Where them girls talkin' trash?
Where them girls talkin' trash?
Where they at, where they at, where they at?
Where them bloggers girls at?
Where them bloggers girls at?
Where they at, where they at, where they at?
Where ya lighters at?
Where ya lighters at?
Where they at, where they at, where they at?
Too hard, too hard, too hard, too hard
That I-I-I-I'm so hard
Ah yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm so hard
That I-I-I-I'm so hard
Ah yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm so hard
That I-I-I-I'm so hard
So hard, so hard, so hard, so hard
That I, I, I
