<song artist="Rihanna" title="Feel_The_Adrenaline">
You don't feel the pain 
Too much is not enough 
Nobody said this stuff makes any sense 
We're hooked again 
Point of no return 
See how the buildings burn 
Light up the night 
Such pretty sight 
Adrenaline keeps me in the game 
Adrenaline you don't even feel the pain 
Wilder than your wildest dreams 
When you're going to extremes 
It takes adrenaline 
(You don't feel the pain) 
Sail through an empty night 
It's only you and I who understand 
There is no plan 
Get closer to the thrill 
Only time will kill 
What's in your eyes 
Is so alive 
Adrenaline keeps me in the game 
Adrenaline you don't even feel the pain 
Wilder than your wildest dreams 
When you're going to extremes 
It takes adrenaline 
Run through the speed of sound 
Every thing slows you down 
And all color that surrounds you 
Are bleeding to the walls 
All the things you really need 
Just wait to find the speed 
Then you will achieve 
Escape velocity 
Too much is not enough 
Nobody gave it up 
Im not the kind 
To lay down and die 
Adrenaline 
Keeps me in the game 
Adrenaline 
You don't even feel the pain 
Wilder than your wildest dreams 
When you're going to extremes 
It takes adrenaline 
Adrenaline 
Screaming out your name 
Adrenaline 
You don't even feel the pain 
Wilder than your wildest dreams 
When you're going to extremes 
It takes adrenaline 
(Adrenaline) 
You don't even feel the pain 
You don't even feel the pain 
I'm going to extremes 
There is nothing in between 
You don't even feel the pain 
You don't even feel the pain 
You don't even feel the pain 
You don't even feel the pain
