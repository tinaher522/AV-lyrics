<song artist="Rihanna" title="Selfish_Girl">
(Verse 1)
Baby boy what you done to me
I saw you smiling suddenly
I can't get you out my mind
I got a bad boy I can't lie
I want your time and your full attention
I wanna to talk to you and not to mention good love that you give to me I think about it constantly no I
won't apologize for feeling like I do it's just the simple facts of life Im crazy over you
(Chorus)
Im a selfish girl when it comes to you every minute of the day Im addicted to what your giving me boy
it's killing me when it comes to love Im not trying share you might think Im greedy but I just don't care
I need you in my world cause Im a selfish girl
(Verse 2)
I understand that you got your crew but I've got something in mind for you make you lose all track of
time guaranteed to blow your mind I don't care what anybody got to say maybe they never had it quite this
way let them talk and criticize they all need to recognize They might see Im a bit extreme to need you
night and day but what I feel can't be consealed there ain't no other way
(Chorus)
Im a selfish girl when it comes to you every minute of the day Im addicted to what your giving me boy
it's killing me when it comes to love Im not trying share you might think Im greedy but I just don't care
I need you in my world cause Im a selfish girl
(Bridge)
Boy you got me trippin
I didn't know what I was missing
This is crazy (crazy)
So amazing (so amazing)
I didn't mean to be demanding but I hope your understanding
Im not playing boy (Im not playing boy)
Im just saying boy
They might see Im a bit extreme to need you night and day but what I feel can't be consealed there ain't
no other way
(Bridge and fade)
