(feat. RIzzIKidd)
Please don't stop the music
(oh, RizzIKidd)
Please don't stop the music
(Rihanna, Don't that sound so good together)
Please don't stop the music
(C'mon, I know you been waiting on this one)
Please don't stop the music
(Yeah)
It's getting late
I'm making my way over to
My favorite place
I gotta get my body moving
Shake the stress away
I wasn't looking for nobody
When you looked my way
Possible candidate, yeah
Who knew
That you'd be up here,
Looking like you do
You makin' staying over here, impossible
Baby, I must say your aura is incredible
If you don't have to go, don't
Do you know what you startedÂ ?
I just came here to party
But now we're rockin on the dance
Floor, actin' naughty
Your hands around my waist
Just let the music play
We're hand in hand chest to chest
And now we're face to face
[ CHORUS ]
I wanna take you away
Let's escape into the music, DJ let it play
I just can't refuse it
Like the way you do this
Keep on rockin' to it
Please don't stop the, please
Don't stop the music
I wanna take you away
Let's escape into the music, DJ let it play
I just can't refuse it
Like the way you do this
Keep on rockin' to it
Please don't stop the, please don't stop the
Please don't stop the music
Verse RizzIKIdd
(Lets go)
I know you see me and I see you too
Theres no other girls like you so beatuiful
Say you'll thake me away tell me hold on tight
Don't stop the music wanna dance all night
Knowin what I lke girl your just my type
We keepin the floor pumpin and we keepin them hype
Cause theres no othe girl that makes you feel like this
And theres no other flow to make you pop the cris
RizzI to the kidd and Im doing it right
And Rihanna got the voice to make you movee all night
So please hold on tight and enjoy your flight
Tell the DJ to spin it hit repeat all night
Cause theres nobody better as far as I can see
So dancin on the floor is where you need to be
I know we keep you movin so easily
But after the club close come and roll with me
(RizzI)
I wanna take you away
Let's escape into to music
DJ let it play
I just can't refuse it
Like the way you do this
Keep on rockin to it
Please don't stop the
Please don't stop the music
I wanna take you away
Lets escape into the music
DJ let it play
I just can't refuse it
Like the way you do this
Keep on rockin to it
Please don't stop the
Please don't stop the
Please don't stop the music
Ma ma say, ma ma sa

Please don't stop the music (2x)
I wanna take you away
Lets escape into the music
DJ let it play
I just can't refuse it
Like the way you do this
Keep on rockin to it
Please don't stop the
Please don't stop the music
I wanna take you away
Lets escape into the music
DJ let it play
I just can't refuse it
Like the way you do this
