<song artist="Rihanna" title="If_It's_Lovin'_That_You_Want">
I want to let you know
That you don't have to go
Don't wonder no more
What I think about you
If it's lovin' that you want
Then you should make me your girl, your girl
If it's lovin' that you need
Then baby come and share my world, share my world
If it's lovin' that you want
Then come and take a walk with me, with me
'Cause, everything that you need, I got it right here baby, baby
Now it's obvious you need a friend to come hold you down
Be that one you share your everything when no one's around
Baby come tell me your secrets, and tell me all your dreams
'Cause I can see you need someone to trust
You can trust in me
Di di di di da da dey
So just call me whenever your lonely
Di di di di da da dey
I'll be your friend, I can be your homey
If it's lovin' that you want
Then you should make me your girl, your girl
If it's lovin' that you need
Then baby come and share my world, share my world
If it's lovin' that you want
Then come and take a walk with me, with me
'Cause, everything that you need, I got it right here baby, baby
It been so long I've had this feeling
That we could be
Everything we've ever wanted baby
Your fantasy
I won't push to hard or break your heart
'Cause my love's sincere
I'm not like any other girl you know
So let me erase your fears
Di di di di da da dey
So just call me whenever your lonely
Di di di di da da dey
I'll be your friend, I can be your homey
If it's lovin' that you want
Then you should make me your girl, your girl
If it's lovin' that you need
Then baby come and share my world, share my world
If it's lovin' that you want
Then come and take a walk with me, with me
'Cause, everything that you need, I got it right here baby, baby
If it's lovin' that you want
Then you should make me your girl, your girl
If it's loving that you need
Then baby come and share my world, share my world (I got what you need so come share my world)
If it's lovin' that you want
Then come and take a walk with me, with me
'Cause, everything that you need, I got it right here baby, baby
Di di di di da da dey
So just call me whenever your lonely
Di di di di da da dey
I'll be your friend, I can be your homey
If it's lovin' that you want
Then you should make me your girl, your girl
If it's lovin' that you need
Then baby come and share my world, share my world
If it's lovin' that you want
Then come and take a walk with me, with me
'Cause, everything that you need, I got it right here baby, baby
I want to let you know
That you don't have to go
Don't wonder no more
What I think about you
What I think about you boy
I got what you need so come share my world oh
