Ooh na na, what's my name
Whats my name, whats my name
Not everybody knows how to work my body
Knows how to make me want it
But boy you stay up on it
You got that something that keeps me so off balance
Baby you're a challenge, lets explore your talent
[Chorus x2]
Hey boy I really wanna see if you can go downtown with a girl like me
Hey boy, I really wanna be with you
Cause your just my type
Ooh na na na na
I need a boy to take it over
Looking for a girl to put you over, uh
Oooooh, oooooh

Ooh na na, what's my name
Ooh na na, what's my name
Whats my name, whats my name
[Rihanna]
Baby you got me, and aint nowhere that I'd be
Then with your arms around me
Back and forth you rock me yeah
So I surrender, to every word you whisper
Every door you enter, I will let you in
[Chorus]
You're so amazing, you took the time to figure me out
Thats why you take me, way past the point of turning me on
You bout to break me, I swear you got me losing my mind
Ooh na na, what's my name
Ooh na na, what's my name
Ooh na na, what's my name
Ooh na na, what's my name
Ooh na na, what's my name
Whats my name, whats my name
[Chorus]
[End]
