<song artist="Rihanna" title="Is_This_Love">
I don't no
If this is love oh
All i no is for sertain
You've been callin me up and saying 
Baby were you at
I wanna come home with you
Do everythin possible and then
Oh im here but is this thing we have called love
Is this love oh
Ill never no
But when you do 
Please just let me no (let me no oh)
Is this love 
Baby please understand all my needs
I need to no if you care ( if you care)
Dont make me wait no longer (dont make me wait no)
