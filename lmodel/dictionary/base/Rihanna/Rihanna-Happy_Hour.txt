<song artist="Rihanna" title="Happy_Hour">
How can I know what you need
If you never ask
How can I drive you crazy
When I've got no gas
How could we be together
When we're so far apart
You tell me that you love me then you go and break my heart
I'll admit that I've got problems if
You say that you will help me solve 'em yes
I realize some days I can be sweet and some I'm sour
But I can't help but drink you up, cause you're my happy hour
Just because
I'm never happy when I'm sobered up
I'm only good if I can have a cup
Some days I'm sweet and some I'm sour
But I can't help but drink you up, cause you're my happy hour
Only when, you go away and I can get my fix
I'm only good if I can have a sip
Some days I'm sweet and some I'm sour
But I can't help but drink you up, cause you're my happy hour
Why should I be your woman
When you've got 2 more
Why should I say that I do
When I know you don't
Why should I stay here with you
When you are always gone
And why should I be open when you stay so bottled up
I'll admit that I've got problems if
You say that you will help me solve 'em yes
I realize some days I can be sweet and some I'm sour
But I can't help but drink you up, cause you're my happy hour
Just because
I'm never happy when I'm sobered up
I'm only good if I can have a cup
Some days I'm sweet and some I'm sour
But I can't help but drink you up, cause you're my happy hour
Only when, you go away and I can get my fix
I'm only good if I can have a sip
Some days I'm sweet and some I'm sour
But I can't help but drink you up, cause you're my happy hour
You were are all I ever needed
You were all I ever had
You were all I ever wanted
But you were making me bad
" I need a drink "
" Can I have a part-time lover "
" Shakin', not stirred "
" On the rocks "
Just because
I'm never happy when I'm sobered up
I'm only good if I can have a cup
Some days I'm sweet and some I'm sour
But I can't help but drink you up, cause you're my happy hour
Only when, you go away and I can get my fix
I'm only good if I can have a sip
Some days I'm sweet and some I'm sour
But I can't help but drink you up, cause you're my happy hour
