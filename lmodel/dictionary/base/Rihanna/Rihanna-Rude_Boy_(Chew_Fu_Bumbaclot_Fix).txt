Come here rude boy, boy, can you get it up?
Come here rude boy, boy, is you big enough?
Take it, take it, baby, baby
Take it, take it, love me, love me
Come here rude boy, boy, can you get it up?
Come here rude boy, boy, is you big enough?
Take it, take it, baby, baby

Tonight I'mma let you be the captain
Tonight I'mma let you do your thing, yeah
Tonight I'mma let you be a rider
Giddy up, giddy up, giddy up babe
Tonight I'mma let it be fire
Tonight I'mma let you take me higher
Tonight baby, we can get it on
Yeah, we can get it on, yeah
Do you like it boy?
I wa-wa-want what you wa-wa-want
Give it to me, baby like boom boom boom
What I wa-wa-want is what you wa-wa-want
Na, na

Come here rude boy, boy, is you big enough?
Take it, take it, baby, baby

Come here rude boy, boy, can you get it up?
Come here rude boy, boy, is you big enough?
Take it, take it, baby, baby
Take it, take it, love me, love me
Tonight I'mma give it to you harder
Tonight I'mma turn your body out
Relax, let me do it how I wanna
If you got it, I need it and I'mma put it down
Buckle up, I'mma give it to you stronger
Hands up, we can go a little longer
Tonight I'mma get a little crazy
Get a little crazy, baby
Do you like it boy?

Give it to me, baby like boom boom boom
What I wa-wa-want is what you wa-wa-want
Na, na

Take it, take it, baby, baby

Come here rude boy, boy, can you get it up?
Come here rude boy, boy, is you big enough?
Take it, take it, baby, baby
Take it, take it, love me, love me
I like the way you touch me there
I like the way you pull my hair
Baby, if I don't feel it
I ain't faking, no, no
I like when you tell me kiss it here
I like when you tell me move it there
So giddy up, time to get it up
You say you a rude boy, show me what you got now
Come here right now
Take it, take it, baby, baby
Take it, take it, love me, love me
Come here rude boy, boy, can you get it up?
Come here rude boy, boy, is you big enough?
Take it, take it, baby, baby
Take it, take it, love me, love me
Come here rude boy, boy, can you get it up?
Come here rude boy, boy, is you big enough?
Take it, take it, baby, baby
Take it, take it, love me, love me
(Love me, love me)
(Love me, love me)
(Love me, love me)
Take it, take it, baby, baby
Take it, take it, love me, love me
(Love me, love me)
(Love me, love me)
(Love me, love me)
Take it, take it
Baby, baby
Take it, take it
Love me, love me
