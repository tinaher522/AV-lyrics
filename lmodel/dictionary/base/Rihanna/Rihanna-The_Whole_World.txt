We're like fire and ice,
Taking over the whole world (The whole world).
From the mountain tops,
Down to the boys and girls (Boys and girls).
And the tree of knowledge it grow,
Cause we plant the seed (Yeahh).

So we got just what you need.
Shy Ronnie. 
Speak up.
Shy Ronnie, Speak up.
Okay, ill take it from here (Haha) 
We're like fire and ice,
Taking over the whole world (The whole world).
From the mountain tops,
Down to the boys and girls (Boys and girls).

You know i stay steady, strapping.
Cause life is a b*tch.
