She spin head right round, when she up on the pole, everybody turn around when she walk in the door, then she shut the club down when she drop it down 
Low, low, low, low, low.
[Rihanna]
Drop It, Drop it, Drop it down 1 time for you,
Drop it, Drop it, Drop it down 2 times for you,
Drop It, Drop it, Drop it down 3 times for you,
I Make it hot boy, Imma Make it hot boy.
I See You Looking at me, You Saw Me Looking At you, I'm already so make your move, So What you waiting for, bring it, bring it, Show me what you got for me
Bring it, bring it show me what you got.
