<song artist="Rihanna" title="You_Da_One">
You da one that I dream about all day
You da one that I think about always
You are the one so I make sure I behave
My love is your love, your love is my love
Baby I love you, I need you here
With me all the time
Baby we meant to be, you got me
Smiling all the time
You know how to give me that
You know how to pull me back
When I go running, running,
Try'na get away from loving you
You know how to love me hard
I won't lie I'm falling hard
Yup, I'm falling for you
But there's nothing wrong with that
You da one that I dream about all day
You da one that I think about always
You are the one so I make sure I behave
My love is your love, your love is my love
You da one that I dream about all day
You da one that I think about always
You are the one so I make sure I behave
My love is your love, your love is mine
Baby come take me now
Hold me now make me come alive
You got the sweetest touch
I'm so happy you came in my life
You know how to give me that
You know how to pull me back
When I go running, running,
Try'na get away from loving, yah
You know how to love me hard
I won't lie I'm falling hard
Yup, I'm falling for you
But there's nothing wrong with that
You da one that I dream about all day
You da one that I think about always
You are the one so I make sure I behave
My love is your love, your love is my love
You da one that I dream about all day
You da one that I think about always
You are the one so I make sure I behave
My love is your love, your love is mine
Yes I'm kinda crazy
That's what happens baby
When you put it down you shouldn't'a
Give it to me good like that
Shouldn't'a hit it like that
Had me yelling like that
Didn't know you'd would'a had me coming back
You da one that I'm feeling
You da one that I'm loving
Ain't no other niggas like you
No there's just one, one, one, one,one,one,
No baby just one, one,one,one
I bet you wanna know
You da one that I dream about all day
You da one that I think about always
You are the one so I make sure I behave
My love is your love, your love is my love
You da one that I dream about all day
You da one that I think about always
You are the one so I make sure I behave
My love is your love, your love is mine
