Rihanna:
On the first page of our story, the future seemed so bright
Then this thing turned out so evil, I don't know why I'm still surprised
Even angels have their wicked schemes, and you take that to new extremes
But you'll always be my hero, even though you've lost your mind
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie, oh-oh, I love the way you lie
Now there's gravel in our voices, glass is shattered from the fight
In this tug of war you'll always win, even when I'm right
'Cause you feed me fables from your hand, with violent words and empty threats
And it's sick that all these battles, are what keeps me satisfied
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie, oh-oh, I love the way you lie, oh-oh
So maybe I'm a masochist
I try to run but I don't wanna ever leave
Till the walls are goin' up
In smoke with all our memories
Eminem:
It's morning, you wake a sun ray hits your face
Smeared makeup as we lay in the wake of destruction
Hush baby speak softly, tell me you're awfully sorry
That you pushed me into the coffee table last night so I can push you off me
Try and touch me so I can scream at you not to touch me
Run out the room and I'll follow you like a lost puppy
Baby without you I'm nothing, I'm so lost hug me
Then tell me how ugly I am, but that you'll always love me
Then after that shove me, in the aftermath of the
Destructive path that we're on, two psychopaths but we
Know that no matter how many knives we put in each other's backs
That we'll have each other's backs, 'cause we're that lucky
Together we move mountains, let's not make mountains out of molehills
You hit me twice, yeah but who's counting?!
I may have hit you three times, I'm starting to lose count
But together, we'll live forever, we found the youth fountain
Our love is crazy we're nuts, but I refuse counselling
This house is too huge, if you move out I'll burn all two thousand
Square feet of it to the ground, ain't shit you can do about it
'Cause with you I'm in my fucking mind, without you I'm out it
Rihanna:
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie, I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
