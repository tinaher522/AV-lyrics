<song artist="Rihanna" title="Numb">
[Rihanna]
Ecstasy... in the air
I don't care, can't tell me nothing
I'm impaired, the worst for wear
'Cause...
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb...
Can't you say...
Ain't it clear, I don't care
Get closer to me...
If you dare
I double dare
'Cause...
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb...
[Eminem]
I'm blasted! (Drywall!) Look me in my eyeball!
Do I look high? (No!)
I love the way you lie girl, yeah, yeah, yeah
Come here dear, I'm trying to get closer to you
I'm motioning you to pull over you boo
I'm the siren that you hear (hear)
I'm the butt police, and I'm looking at your REAR, REAR, REAR!
But odds are, Imma end up in the back of a squad car
By the end of tonight
I'm a rock star, get your wind up
It's attack of the oddball
Homie can you show me where the gosh darn bath salts are?
Cause I'm sick of sniffing asphalt, every thought scarred
Got my pants off at the sidewalk, and crosswalks and suspenders
And I can't feel my lips (be)cause...
[Rihanna]
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
