Relax, let me do it how I wanna
If you got it, I need it and I'mma put it down
Buckle up, I'mma give it to you stronger
Hands up, we can go a little longer
Tonight, I'mma get a little crazy
Get a little crazy, baby

I like the way you touch me there
I like the way you pull my hair
Babe, if I don't feel it I ain't faking
No, no
I like when you tell me kiss it there
I like when you tell me move it there
So giddy up
Time to giddy up
You say you're a rude boy
Show me what you got now
Come here right now
