<song artist="Rihanna" title="You_Don't_Love_Me_(No,No,No)">
No, no, no, you don't love me and I know now
No, no, no, you don't love me so let me go now
(I can't let you go, can't let you go)
If you ask me, baby, I shoulda left you along time ago, no
Playas gonna play at least that's what they say
Well, I know that for myself now
(You know I love you)
You said you loved me babe
Then you played your game
A game that I know all to well now
Well, I use to buy your lines
But it's time for me to sail now
No, no, no, you don't love me and I know now
No, no, no, you don't love me so let me go now
(I can't let you go, can't let you go)
If you ask me, baby, I shoulda left you along time ago, no
First you tellin' me no but please tell me yes
Without some of this stress straight up tell me yes
Gimme the keys to ya chest, ya chest will rise never rest
As ya chest you got me feelin' like I'm climbin' on Mount Everest
Hey Rihanna, your lovin' really put me to the test
But if you shoulda let me soon the answer will yes
Yes to this, yes to that, yes to whatever you suggest
So please say yes, no, no, no
Haters gonna hate, I found out much to late
(Let them hate)
I think I know were a little hot now
The truth leads to the lies
The heart ain't always right
And I see that love is blind now
Boy you use to have my trust
Without no trust there ain't no us boy
No, no, no, you don't love me and I know now
No, no, no, you don't love me so let me go now
(I can't let you go, can't let you go)
If you ask me, baby, I shoulda left you along time ago, no
