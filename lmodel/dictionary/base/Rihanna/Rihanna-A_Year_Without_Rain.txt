<song artist="Rihanna" title="A_Year_Without_Rain">
Oooooooooh
Oeeeeeeeh
Can you feel me
When i think about you
With every breath i take
Every Minute
Don't matter what i do
My world is an empty place
Like ive been wonderin the dessert,
For a thousand days ( oooh ).
Don't know if its a mirage,
But i always see your face, Baby..
I'm missing you so much
Help rush me outa it now (?)
A day without you is like a year without rain.
I need you by my side,
Don't know how else to find
But a day without you is like a year without rain ( oooh )
Ooooooooooh
The stars are burning,
I hear your voice in my mind ( in my mind )
Can't you hear me calling.
My Heart is yearning,
Like the oceean is running dry
Catch me i'm falling
It's like the ground is crumbling underneath my feet,
Won't you save me
Its gonna be in my Sume(?) ,
When you get back to me( ooooh Baby )
I'm missing you so much
Help rush me outa it now (?)
A day without you is like a year without rain.
I need you by my side,
Don't know how else to find
But a day without you is like a year without rain ( oooh )
Ooooooooooh
So let this drought come to an end
And make this dessert flower again
I'm so glad you found me, stick arround me,
Baby baby Baby ( oeeeh )
It's A World of wonder,
With you in my life
So hurry baby
Dont waste no more time
I Need you nearer,
I..can't explain
But a day without you
Is like a year without rain ( oooh )
I'm missing you so much
Help rush me outa it now (?)
A day without you is like a year without rain.
I need you by my side,
Don't know how else to find
But a day without you is like a year without rain ( oooh )
Oooooooh oooooooooooooooooooooh
