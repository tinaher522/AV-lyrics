You are missing that kissing when we're over
Boy what i'm feeling never feel it about another
I need you, why can't you come over
And you my lover
But I love you like a brother
Baby don't want at the end of the day
You are who you are
And I love it that way
Lasting love, if you know the difference
You had a little game on ya
Caught up in your feelings
We together like, ohhh
You know that imma do whatever I'm not gon' leave
This kind of love don't come easy
We don't care what they think
Promise we'll stay the same
Say that you stay right here for me
See I know you like being round chicks
Turn looking at hips, and a little outfit
What can I say
That's what I love about you babe
Yeah don't mess, 'cause I know you gon' lie
You way too sexy, never be shy
What can I say
That's what I love about you babe
Do ya thang, do ya thang,
Do ya, do ya, do ya thang
Do ya thang, do ya thang,
Do ya, do ya, do ya thang
Do ya thang, do ya thang,
Do ya, do ya, do ya thang
You the shit
Yaeah, baby you the bomb
Middle of the day
Give Me What I want
It feels so special
It feels so good
And he ain’t going no where even if he could
I got that ow ow
You know what I’m talking about bout
Make a nigga scream and shout, shout
Every time the lights go out out
We out out
You know that imma do whatever I'm not gon' leave
This kind of love don't come easy
We don't care what they think
Promise we'll stay the same
Say that you stay right here for me
See I know you like being round chicks
Turn looking at hips, and a little outfit
What can I say
That's what I love about you babe
Yeah don't mess, cause I know you gon' lie
You way too sexy, never be shy
What can I say
That's what I love about you babe
Do ya thang, do ya thang,
Do ya, do ya, do ya thang
Do ya thang, do ya thang,
Do ya, do ya, do ya thang
Do ya thang, do ya thang,
Do ya, do ya, do ya thang
And I know what you thinking of
That I don't know a thing about love
But what I know is I'm his girl
And he's the one for me
See this shit ain't worth tripping over
Do you thing, it doesn't matter
As long as we gon' rock forever
Love is all we need
Do ya thang, do ya thang,
Do ya, do ya, do ya thang
Do ya thang, do ya thang,
Do ya, do ya, do ya thang
Do ya thang, do ya thang,
Do ya, do ya, do ya thang
See I know you like being round chicks
Turn looking at hips, and a little outfit
What can I say
That's what I love about you babe
