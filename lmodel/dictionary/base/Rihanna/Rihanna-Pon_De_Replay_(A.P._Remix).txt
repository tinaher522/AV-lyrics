(feat. A.P.)
[A.P.'s Hook]
Give them a run like the cop's comin after
Signal da plane like you trying to get captured
Move your body one time to the bass line
Go ahead ma, behind your waist line 
(Chorus: Repeat Twice)
Come Mr. DJ song pon de replay
Come Mr. DJ won't you turn the music up
All the gals pon the dance floor wanting some more what
Come Mr. DJ won't you turn the music up 
[Verse 1: Rihanna]
It goes 1 by 1 even 2 by 2
Everybody on the floor let me show you how we do
Lets go dip it low then you bring it up slow
Whine it up 1 time whine it back once more 
Run, run, run, run
Everybody move run
Let me see you move and
Rock it til the grooves done
Shake it till the moon becomes the sun (sun)
Everybody in the club give me a run (run)
If you ready to move say it (yeah)
One time for your mind say it (yeah yeah)
Well i'm ready for ya
Come let me show ya
You want to groove im'a show you how to move

[Chorus: Repeat Twice]

[Rihanna's Bridge: Repeat Twice]
Hey mister
Please mister DJ
Tell me if you hear me
Turn the music up 
[A.P.] Can you heel-toe a little mo' for a little dough? 
If I give you, will you wiggle it a little, let me know
I say, Pon De Replay, we tell the DJ we gon do what ever dance he say
Give them a run, give me ya back then give me ya front
Risky, kiss me, try to give me your tongue
I tell that girl all I want is one thing
Now she's upset, I only want one thing 
Talking rough sex, that hard love making 
Have me on my job like Jamaicans
Making moves, do what you do young sexy thing 
You a visual, now signal da plane
So feisty, fiery, you make me feel ire, ire
Had themÂ ? now it's time she try me
A.P. straight like that, watch me ride
Pass the dutch here on my left hand side, let's rock
[Verse 2: Rihanna]
It goes 1 by 1 even 2 by 2
Everybody in the club gon be rockin when i'm through
Let the bass from the speakers run through ya sneakers
Move both ya feet and run to the beat 
Run, run, run, run
Everybody move run
Let me see you move and
Rock it til the grooves done
Shake it til the moon becomes the sun (sun)
Everybody in the club give me a run (run)
If you ready to move say it (yeah)
One time for your mind say it (yeah yeah)
Well i'm ready for ya
Come let me show ya
You want to groove im'a show you how to move 
[Chorus: Repeat Twice]

[Rihanna Hook 2: Repeat 4 times]
Ok, everybody get down if you feel me
Come and put your hands up to the ceiling 
[Chorus: Repeat Twice]
Come Mr. DJ song pon de replay

Signal da plane like you trying to get captured
