Guess Who? You Bitches Is Ri-Ri(Lum)
Lambourgini strawberry kiwi
Fashion week in Paris was nice
Every Designer had my size(ha ha ha ha ha ha)
Switch my hair they gon copy her
Switch my gear they gon copy her
Lo-lo-look at how they stare just to copy her
Well Roger that!Did you copy that?
Co-co-copy cat.
I am g-going home
I am g-going home
I shut it down already
I am g-going home
I am g-going home
I am g-going home
I shut it down already
I am g-going home
Backdoor because I am leaving
One more and now they just greddy
Yo, tell them to go make dem want, we dont misguide
Collar up, shades low and I'm in disgiuse
Switch my hair they gon copy her
Switch my gear they gon copy her
Lo-lo-look at how they stare just to copy her
Well Roger that, did you copy that?
Co-co-copy cat.
I am g-going home
I am g-going home
I shut it down already
I am g-going home
I am g-going home
I am g-going home
I shut it down already
I am g-going home
We ready for the show
We get alot of dough
And yu alread know
Yea yu already kno
That i done shut it down
Thats why im going home
