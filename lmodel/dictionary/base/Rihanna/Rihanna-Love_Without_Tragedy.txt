<song artist="Rihanna" title="Love_Without_Tragedy">
Red lipstick, rose petals, heart break
I was his Marilyn Monroe
Brown eyes, tuxedo, fast cars
A James Dean on the low,
Dean on the low
I ask you what's the matter?
You say, oh it's nothing at all
Heart's racing, outta control
And you knew that I couldn't let it go
You used to be this boy I loved
And I used to be this girl of your dreams
Who knew the course of this one drive
Injured us fatally
You took the best years of my life
I took the best years of your life
Felt like love struck me in the night
I prayed that love don't strike twice
Red lipstick, rose petals, heart break
I was his Marilyn Monroe
Brown eyes, tuxedo, fast cars
A James Dean on the low
What's love without tragedy
What's love without tragedy
What's love without tragedy
What's love without tragedy
Mother Mary I swear I wanna change
Mister jesus i'd love to be queen
But im from the left side of an island
Never thought this many people would even know my name
As time flies, way above me
For you ive cried, tears see thee
Oh glory, the prayers carry me
I'll be star you keep directing me
Lets make the best scene they've ever seen
Let's capture the moment
Cause even forever aint forever
I swear by the moment
Cause together aint promise forever
Let's live in the moment
As long as we got each other
Die in the moment
I'm prepared to die in the moment
Cause even forever ain't forever
I swear by the moment
Cause together aint promised forever
Let's live in the moment
As long as we got each other
Die the moment
I'm prepared to die in the moment
To cry in the moment
Mother Mary I swear I wanna change
Mister jesus i'd love to be queen
But im from the left side of an island
Never thought this many people would even know my name
As time flies, way above me
For you ive cried, tears see thee
Oh glory, the prayers carry me
Ill be star you keep directing me
Lets make the best scene they;ve ever seen
Let's capture the moment
Cause even forever aint forever
I swear by the moment
Cause together aint promise forever
Let's live in the moment
As long as we got each other
Die the moment
I'm prepared to die in the moment
I'm prepared to die in the moment
I'm prepared to die in the moment
Cause even forever aint forever
I swear by the moment
I'm prepared to die in the moment
