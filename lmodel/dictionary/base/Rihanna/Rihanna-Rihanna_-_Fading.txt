<song artist="Rihanna" title="Rihanna_-_Fading">
You say you love me,
But they feel, like words to me
Well this just ain't working
Stop thinking, you can run over me
Drifting,settling,off to a foreign place
If I can't see whats infront of me, it's a mystery
But then apparently things just aint the same
And I'm ready for change
Go on, be gone, bye bye, so long
[chorus]
Can't ya see that your fading, fading, fading feh-eh-eh-ade
Away, away, away, away
I opened up my eyes and I finally realize
Today, today, it's too late
Your fading away
Put a sock in it, just stop running your mouth
Got my mind made up ,I ain't coming back again
No way, No way, No way, no way
Cause I'm so fed up
Boy you got me messed up
If we hookin' back up, don't push your luck
Today, Today
I'm blowing you away 
Things just aint the same and I'm ready for change
Go on, be gone, ta-ta, so long
[chorus]
Can't ya see that your fading, fading, fading feh-eh-eh-ade
Away, away, away, away
I opened up my eyes and I finally realize
Today, today, it's too late
Your fading away

I saw u turned into a ghost right in front of my eyes
Tell me what's a girl to do when she's crying inside
I'm about to go insane
I'm jumping off this train
Whether wrong or right, I'll be gone by night
[chorus]
Can't ya see that your fading, fading, fading feh-eh-eh-ade
Away, away, away, away
I opened up my eyes and I finally realize
Today, today, it's too late
Your fading away
