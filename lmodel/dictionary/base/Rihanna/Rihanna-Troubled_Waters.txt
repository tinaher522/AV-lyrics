<song artist="Rihanna" title="Troubled_Waters">
You you... You you,   ye yeah
You you... whoa ooh yeah
I was such a fool for you,
Would do anything yes its true,
Only had eyes for you,
Ignored the other fellas in your crew,
Ey..
I miss the football games,
The things you did,
That drove me insane,
The way we used to make love,
Its all balls'd up,
Like getting over thugs,
Sleeping alone,
And feeling ruff,
And I'm a fool,
For feeling like I really want him back, I want him back,
Tell me i'm a ruin,
When the love I had with him,
It never last, it'll never last.
I need a bridge,
To get me over troubled water,
I need a bridge,
To get me over you.
Tell me how do I make this transition?
Can't kick it to the other side,
Reminiscences,
Think its swell,
It's worth skinny dipping,
Maybe I'll drown, and be found, by the one who revives me,
And keeps me alive see
When I'm going up the deep end,
No bets, but I got lotta stress,
When it all falls down,
I'll be put it the a test.
And I'm a fool
For feeling like I really want him back, I want him back
Tell me I'm a ruin
When the love I had with him
It never last, it'll never last
I need a bridge
To get me over troubled water
I need a bridge
To get me over you
Theres be so many ups and downs
Guess I fought to make it work
And now a knew girls come along
And she's enjoying all my perks
And I still haven't cried
Guess that they were too deep inside,
And too ashamed to come by,
That I'm still in love with you
And I'm a fool
For feeling like I really want him back, I want him back
Tell me I'm a ruin
When the love I had with him
It never last, it'll never last
I need a bridge
To get me over the troubled water
I need a bridge
To get me over you
