<song artist="Rihanna" title="Lost_In_Paradise">
What am I supposed to do with this heart, with this heart?
How do I take it up if the loving on is like a work of art?
In love we all will fall but we fell a little harder
What am I supposed to do with this heart, with this heart?
It may be wrong but it feels right to be lost in paradise
I'm so lost in paradise
If I open up my eyes
I can see the storm, I can see the sky
I can see the darkness, flashing lights
All my fears gone tonight
Let me stay, I'm lost in paradise
How was I to know that my love was delusional?
Somebody tell me how to mend a broken heart and soul
In love we all will fall but we fell a little harder
What am I supposed to do with this heart, with this heart?
It may be wrong but it feels right to be lost in paradise
I'm so lost in paradise (lost in paradise)
If I open up my eyes
I can see the storm, I can see the sky
I can see the darkness, flashing lights
All my fears gone tonight
Let me stay, I'm lost in paradise
It may be wrong but it feels right
All my fears are gone tonight
I'm lost in paradise
I'm so lost in paradise
If I open up my eyes
I can see the storm, I can see the sky
I can see the darkness, flashing lights
All my fears gone tonight
Let me stay, I'm lost in paradise
Lost in paradise
Yeah, lost in paradise
Lost in paradise
