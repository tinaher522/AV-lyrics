<song artist="Rihanna" title="Breakin'_Dishes">
I don't know who you think I am
I don't know who you think I am
I don't know who you think I am
I don't know who you think I am
He been gone since three thirty
And coming home, lately at three thirty
I'm super cool, I've been a fool
But now I'm hot and baby you gon' get it
Now I ain't tripping (Ah!)
I ain't twisted (Ah!)
I ain't demented (Huh!)
Well, just a lil' bit (Huh!)
I'm kickin' ass
I'm taking names
I'm on flame
Don't come home late
I'm breaking dishes
Up in here
All night (Uh huh)
I ain't gon' stop until I see police and lights
Imma fight a man tonight
Imma fight a man tonight
Imma fight a man, a man, a ma-e-a-a-an
A man, a man, a ma-e-a-a-an
I'm still waiting, come through the door
I'm killing time, you know, bleaching your clothes
I'm roasting marshmallows on the fire
And what I'm burning is your attire
I am getting restless
I am getting testy
And I can't believe he's always out
Every night and never checks in
Is he cheating? Man, I don't know
I am looking round for something else to throw
I'm breakin' dishes
Up in here
All night (Uh huh)
I ain't go stop until I see police and lights (Uh huh)
I'm a fight a man tonight
I'm a fight a man tonight
I'm a fight a man, a man, a ma-e-a-a-an
A man, a man, a ma-e-a-a-an
Ohhhhh
I don't know who you think I am (I am...)
But I really don't give a damn right now
If you don't come imma huff and puff
And blow this, blow this whole
Blow this, blow this,
Imma blow this, blow this whole
Blow this, blow this,
Imma blow this, blow this whole
Blow this house house down!
Dishes, breakin' dishes, breakin' dishes
I'm breakin' dishes
Up in here
All night (Uh huh)
I ain't gon' stop until I see police lights (Uh huh)
Imma fight a man tonight
Imma fight a man tonight
Imma fight a man, a man, a ma-e-a-a-an
A man, a man, a ma-e-a-a-an
A man, a man, a ma-e-a-a-an
A man, a man, a ma-e-a-a-an 
Breakin' breakin' br...
