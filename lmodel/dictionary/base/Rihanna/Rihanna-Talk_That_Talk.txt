Uh, I've been try'na chill
Bitches wanna fuck me
Every little city I go, fuck me
Shawty musta heard
Got the word out, move da' D
Had to buy a bladder she like
"Oh I gotta pee," ha ha ha
Ran into a rocker in my restroom
Singer slash actress in my bedroom
Gotta have a ticket for a walk through
Everything I do is big
Real talk big money, 
I talk big homes
I sell lotta 'renas, 
I call like getting don't
Million dollar voice, 
Paying through the phone
We heading to the top, 
If you coming come on
I'm flying out to Piza
Just to get some pizza
Flyin' out to Jamaica
Just to roll some reefa
Sex on the beach
Left love speechless
Instead of money talk
Tell these other niggas speak up
