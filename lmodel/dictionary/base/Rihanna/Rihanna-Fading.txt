<song artist="Rihanna" title="Fading">
You say you love me
Well they feel like words to me
Well this just ain't working
Stop thinking you can run over me
I'm drifting, I'm settling
Off to a foreign place
If I can't see what's in front of me
It's a mystery, well then apparently
Things just ain't the same
And I'm ready for change
Go on, begone, bye bye, so long
Can't you see that you're
Fading, fading, fading, fa-a-a-ding
Away, away, away, away
I opened up my eyes, and I finally realized
Today, today, it's too late
You're fading away
Put a sock in it just stop running your mouth
Got my mind made up, I ain't coming back again
No way, no way, no way, no way
'Cuz I'm so fed up, boy you got me messed up
If you hit me back up, don't press your luck today, today
I'm blowing you away
Things just ain't the same
And I'm ready for change
Go on, begone, tah tah, so long
Can't you see that you're
Fading, fading, fading, fa-a-a-ding
Away, away, away, away
I opened up my eyes, and I finally realized
Today, today, it's too late
You're fading away
So you turned into a ghost right in front of my eyes
Tell me what's a girl to do when she's crying inside?
I'm about to go and say
I'm jumping off this train
Whether wrong or right, I'll be gone by night
Can't you see that you're
Fading, fading, fading, fa-a-a-ding
Away, away, away, away
I opened up my eyes, and I finally realized
Today, today, it's too late
You're fading away
