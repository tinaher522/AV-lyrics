Come Mr. DJ won't you turn the music up
All the gals pon the dance floor wanting some more what
Come Mr. DJ won't you turn the music up 
[Busta Rhymes]
You got a hotter other than my Copacabana, mama
Gotta lotta shit with you when I'm loving persona mama
Always love to get with you whenever
U need me, mama holla
How you check me, can you give me the oochie walla walla
Swallow a couple shots of Jag and make a dolla
Lil' mama in the crib with a poke to complete your scalla
Talk about an example of a shorty that might need to prowla
Got a chick in the bug, it come with a little shoppahora
Take you to the Caribbean down the Carolina
To the Mediterranean and enjoy the water
When the role is wacky, you keepin' me stocky
Takin' care of this super Mike
When you check on your Papi
When you're right baby, hug me with all your might
And put it on, cause you know it's on tonight
Break up or make up, you know we I'm gone 
When you find an empty ride 
We will be together and still be bright 
[Chorus]x2

It goes 1 by 1 even 2 by 2
Everybody on the floor let me show you how we do
Lets go dip it low then you bring it up slow
Whine it up 1 time whine it back once more 
Run, run, run, run
Everybody move run
Let me see you move and
Rock it til the grooves done
Shake it till the moon becomes the sun (sun)
