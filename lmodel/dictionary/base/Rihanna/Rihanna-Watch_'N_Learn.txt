<song artist="Rihanna" title="Watch_'N_Learn">
Won't say a thing
About the way you look at me
Except for I like the way
I love the way you touch me
If I turn it leave it, turn it up then I drop it, drop it
Tell ya making faces all the love, you want tell me stop it
I'ma do it, do it, do it till you can't take no more
Till my lipstick ain't up on my face no more
I'ma do it, do it, do it on the bed, on the floor, on the couch
Only 'cause your lips say make it to my mouth
Just because I can't kiss back
Doesn't mean you can't kiss that
Oh, baby, baby, just like that
So, baby, baby, just like that
Oh, baby, baby, turn me out
Oh, baby, baby, don't turn now
It's your turn now, it's your turn now
It's your turn now, it's your turn now
Watch 'n learn now, watch 'n learn how
Watch 'n learn now, eh, eh, eh, eh
Oh, baby, baby
Oh, baby, baby
If you learn now, if you learn now
If you learn how, I'll stay
Don't ask me if you were the first to sleep here
'Cause if he did, you wouldn't even be here
If I turn it leave it, turn it up then I drop it, drop it
Tell ya making faces, all the love you want tell me stop it
I'ma do it, do it, do it till you can't take no more
Till my lipstick ain't up on my face no more
I'ma do it, do it, do it on the bed, on the floor, on the couch
Only 'cause your lips say make it to my mouth
Just because I can't kiss back
Doesn't mean you can't kiss that
Oh, baby, baby, just like that
So, baby, baby, just like that
Oh, baby, baby, turn me out
Oh, baby, baby, don't turn now
It's your turn now, it's your turn now
It's your turn now, it's your turn now
Watch 'n learn now, watch 'n learn how
Watch 'n learn now, eh, eh, eh, eh
Oh, baby, baby
Oh, baby, baby
If you learn now, if you learn now
If you learn how, I'll stay
Oh, come put my love against your case
Oh na, na, na, la la la, just like this
No, no, no, don't be shy, baby, all I need
All doing on me like you aimed to please
Show me how much you mean it
By the way that you please me, baby
I'ma do it, do it, do it on the bed, on the floor, on the couch
Only 'cause your lips say make it to my mouth
Just because I can't kiss back
Doesn't mean you can't kiss that
Oh, baby, baby, just like that
So, baby, baby, just like that
Oh, baby, baby, turn me out
Oh, baby, baby, don't turn now
It's your turn now, it's your turn now
It's your turn now, it's your turn now
Watch 'n learn now, watch 'n learn how
Watch 'n learn now, eh, eh, eh, eh
Oh, baby, baby
Oh, baby, baby
If you learn now, if you learn now
If you learn how, I'll stay
