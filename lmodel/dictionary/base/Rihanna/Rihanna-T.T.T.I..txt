<song artist="Rihanna" title="T.T.T.I.">
Terrible,torture,tacky,irrepressible
Oh!
The first day I stepped in ur house,it was a mess
The first day I broke up with a person,it was based on stress,
Please don't make me feel that way again,
All I'm asking for is a friend
My last guy was T.T.T.I,
Knew he was bad but he was gonna cry,
I couldn't let him go the very first day,
He would die if I left him astray
Cares too much about himself
Hurts me physically and emotionally
Really thinks he runs the relationship
I am about to quit
Sorry but goodbye 
Terrible
Torture
Tacky
Irrepressible
My last guy was T.T.T.I,
Knew he was bad but he was gonna cry,
I couldn't let him go the very first day,
He would die if I left him astray
Got him a new gal,
1 who wants to play his game,
I moved on,
I let him go today
Don't treat me like he did,honey
Don't let yourself only think about yourself,cars,and money
Chorus
Ooooh!
