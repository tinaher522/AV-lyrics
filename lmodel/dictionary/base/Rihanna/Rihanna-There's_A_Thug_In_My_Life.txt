<song artist="Rihanna" title="There's_A_Thug_In_My_Life">
Gotta keep it on the down low
I'll never let my mama know
Only call him on my cell phone, only see him after dark
I met him on the 6 train, just the way he said my name
The brotha hada alot a game, and he open from the start
He scoops me up in his ride, Friday about a quarter to 9
So fly and so fine, and im so glad that he's all mine
(Hook) There's a thug in my life, how'ma gonna tell my mama
She gonna say it aint right, but he's so good to me
There's a thug in my life, and its gonna cause crazy drama
I'm gonna see him tonight, I'm gonna give him everything
I know his crew is kinda shady
Sometimes it gets kinda crazy
But he treats me like a lady, gives me everything I need
I dont care whos hating on me, 'cause every night he's waiting on me
He's got mad personality, a side they never see
My friends tell me to slow down, but everytime that he's around
My heart dont lock down, I feel love and I'm so proud
(Hook)
There's a thug in my life, how'ma gonna tell my mama
She gonna say it aint right, but he's so good to me
There's a thug in my life, and its gonna cause crazy drama
I'm gonna see him tonight, I'm gonna give him everything
(Rap)
T-H-U-G in ya life baby
One in a million thats what you are to me
Anda I know your friends say im rough
But I still got that tender touch just to make u giggle and blush
But ya mom does not approve of us
She needs to be alot more understanding
'Cause all I have for you is thug loving and loving thats all im giving
(Bridge)
Mama dont worry, im not in a hurry
I wont disappoint you, I wont make you sorry
He's the one for me (He's all I ever need)
We'll be together from now till forever
I know its the real thing, if you dont whatever
And I know its meant to be
(Hook)
There's a thug in my life, how'ma gonna tell my mama
She gonna say it aint right, but he's so good to me
There's a thug in my life, and its gonna cause crazy drama
I'm gonna see him tonight, I'm gonna give him everything
(Bridge)
Mama dont worry, im not in a hurry
I wont disappoint you, I wont make you sorry
