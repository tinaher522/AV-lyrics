<song artist="Rihanna" title="Emergency_Room">
oooh oooh
oooh oooh
oooh eh
i was picking up your clothes in the closet
i was bout to throw your jeans in the washer
till i saw a piece of paper saying Tasha
i gotta say ,i found this a bit shocking
theres some receipts here that say you went shoppin
you bought some nike shoes but why you buyin stockings
boy ,how could you lie to me
thought you would die for me
im not accepting 
another apology
after 3 years imma let it go
cant stand around crying no more
got your bags packed sitting by the door
imma leave your heart broken on the floor
you gon be in the emergency room
im standing by your bed and
so tempted to pull out your IV
you gon be in the emergency room
im fighting with myself,
i cant hurt you even tho you hurt me
you gon be in the emergency room
tryin to call a nurse but nobody can help you now
let me see you try to live without me,
now wheres your heartbeat, flat line on the EKG
well i was home late at night watching tv,
got a call from a girl saying Riri,
saw your man at the club , 
i thought he was outta town doing business
and that hed be back in 3 weeks
now im mad, sittin in the kitchen,
gettin sad, looking at your pictures

boy, how could you lie to me
thought you would die for me
im not accepting 
another apology
after 3 years imma let it go
cant stand around crying no more
got your bags packed sitting by the door
imma leave your heart broken on the floor

you gon be in the emergency room
im standing by your bed
so tempted to pull out your IV
you gon be in the emergency room
im fighting with myself, i cant hurt you even tho you hurt me
you gon be in the emergency room
tryin to call a nurse but nobody can help you now
let me see you try to live without me,
now wheres your heartbeat, flat line on the EKG

I did you wrong girl, had a bunch of numbers in my phone girl
but we been in this relationship too long girl
for you to be listening to your silly homegirls
better go on girl.
now baby think about it
everything we gon do they gonna read about it
put it on the radio or tv outlet
do you wanna see your picture in that paper
you know them haters
you hear that 808?
the drum, thats my heartbeat, im goin numb 
i said Rihanna, im feeling stress, im going under cardiac arrest
you gon be in the emergency room
im standing by your bed
so tempted to pull out your IV
you gon be in the emergency room
im fighting with myself, i cant hurt you even tho you hurt me
you gon be in the emergency room
tryin to call a nurse but nobody can help you now
let me see you try to live without me,
now wheres your heartbeat, flat line on the EKG
uh uh
uh uh 
flat line on the EKG
