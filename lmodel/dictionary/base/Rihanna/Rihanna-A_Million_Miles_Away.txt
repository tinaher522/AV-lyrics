<song artist="Rihanna" title="A_Million_Miles_Away">
Here we lay face to face once again
The silence cuts like a knife as we pretend.
and I'm wondering who will be the first 
to say what we both know
We're just holding on to could have beens
and we should be letting go.
(Chorus:)
It feels like you're a million miles away 
as your lying here with me tonight 
I can't even find the words to say
I can find a way to make it right 
and we both know that the story's ending, 
we play the part but we're just pretending 
and I can hide the tears 
cause even though you're here, 
it feels like you're a million miles away.
Was it me, or was it you that broke away? 
From what we were just like the seasons love has changed
And every I think about it
It tears me up inside
Like the rivers of emotion but I got no more tears to cry.
(Chorus:)
(Music Plays:)
(Bridge)
We can try to talk it over 
but we walked that road before
boy, our song has played its last note
And we both know for sure 
that it's time to close that door.
(Chorus:)
