Verse 1:
You had my heart
and We'll never be worlds apart
Maybe in magazines
but you still be my star
Baby cause in the dark
you cant see shiny cars
and that's when you need my there
with you I always share
Because
(chorus:)
When there's sun shine well shine together 
told you I'll be here forever 
said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath Imma stick it out till the end
Now that its raining more than ever 
Know that we'll still have each other 
you can stand under my umbrella 
You can stand under my umbrella
(ella ella eh eh eh) 
Under My Umbrella
(ella ella eh eh eh)
Under my Umbrella
(ella ella eh eh eh)
Under My Umbrella
(ella ella eh eh eh eh eh eh)
Verse 2:
these Fancy Things

Will never come in between
You're part of my entity
if for Infinity
When the world has took its part
When the world has dealt it's cards
if the hand is hard
Together we'll mend your heart
Because
(chorus)
You can run into my arms
it's okay don't be alarmed 
come into me
there's no distance in between our love
so gonna let the rain pour
i'll be all you need and more
Because
(chorus)
It's raining (raining)
Ooh baby its raining (raining)
Baby come into me
come into me
It's raining (raining)
Ooh baby it's raining (raining)
You can always come into me
Come into to me
