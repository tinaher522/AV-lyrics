I got a guy and let me tell you he's so fine
Girls be like, ?your baby easy on the eyes?
I heard it before, these girls so bore they talkin? about
You don't want him, you don't want him, you don't want him

You don't know what it like with him
He like dat dat dat when you get him
?Cause, oooo that boy so cocky,
Like he on every ody
Just cause he pay my bills
Got me livin? up up up in the hills
He be talking noise, talking noise, talking noise
(unknown words)
He said that it'd be hard to leave
I told him yeah right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right.
Without him it would be hard to breathe
I told him yeah right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right
So I got the keys out, boots on, (unknown words), to the door
Watch me crank the car, leave tire marks in the yard
Aey
He said that it'd be hard to leave
I told him yeah right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right
He tried to control me like my name was effing Janet
Like he's the only hot guy on this effing planet
You might be like ?I got it made?
But I  swear you don't know what I, don't know what I, don't know what I go through
You don't know what it like with him
He like dat dat dat when you get him
?Cause, oooo that boy so cocky,
Like he on every ody
Just cause he pay my bills
Got me livin? up up up in the hills
He be talking noise, talking noise, talking noise
(unknown words)
He said that it'd be hard to leave
I told him yeah right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right.
Without him it would be hard to breathe
I told him yeah right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right
So I got the keys out, boots on, (unknown words), to the door
Watch me crank the car, leave tire marks in the yard
Aey
He said that it'd be hard to leave
I told him yeah right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right
He thought that I would just sit and take it but he hell wrong
Like it ain't nothing for me to go out and find another one
Right
He said that it'd be hard to leave
I told him yeah right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right.
Without him it would be hard to breathe
I told him yeah right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right
So I got the keys out, boots on, (unknown words), to the door
Watch me crank the car, leave tire marks in the yard
Aey
He said that it'd be hard to leave
I told him yeah right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right
Aey
