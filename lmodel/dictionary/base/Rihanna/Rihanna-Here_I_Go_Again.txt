Na na na na na
Na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na
Na na na na na
Na na na na na oh na na na na na na na na
[Verse 1]
It's been a minute since I saw you boy
Like some medicine to hear your voice
And I guess that I forgot just how you make me feel when your around
See you haven't lost your sense of style
And you still could melt me with your smile
Can't deny that I still got these feelin' deep inside
[Hook]
It's funny how things could change
But still remain the same
Isn't life just a crazy game
Baby here I go again
[Chorus]
I look into your eyes and then
My heart remembers when
And I realize I neva gotten over you
Everytime I hear your name
It's like the sun shined through the rain
And I realize this happenin'
Baby here I go again
Here I Go Again
[Verse 2]
Still remember how you make me weak
How so hard to find the words to speak
I just cant excape the memories
I tried but I just cant break free
But I closed the door on what we had
But these feelings just keep comin back
Didn't think that you could make me loose control like that
[Hook]
[Chorus]
