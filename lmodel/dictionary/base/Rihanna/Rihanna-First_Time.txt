The First Time You
Kissed My Lips
The First Time Your Finger Tips
Touchin' Me Couldn't Resist
The First, The First The First
[Fablous-Speaking &amp; Rihanna- Singing Chorus In Background]
Wooh ..I Think Everybody Remember The First Time
I Do, Its Irresistable, Its Unstoppable
Guess Who, First Time Fab
Sound Like You Hear Me For The First Time Again Baby haha
[Fabolous Verse 1]
My First Time Checkin You, Only Took A Second To
Start Inspectin You, Without Disrespectin You
Wasn't Inspectin You, To Say It Was Affectin You
What You Wearin Got Me Starin Like You Butt Naked Boo
It May Seem, Like I Dont Even Reckon You
But I Day Dream, About Kissin On The Neck Of You
Style Is Impeccable, Smile Is Incredible
Ain't Nothin' Like Ya, And Baby I Done Met A Few You
The Way I Feel Its Almost Like Crush (crushh)
My Heart Beats Faster Its Almost Like A Rush (rushh)
And Thats Just When You In a In a Room
I Could tell When You Round By The Scent Of Ya Perfume
I See Why They Put These R&amp;B Songs Together
I Feel Like Mariah "We Belong Together"
Its My Pleasure, I Treasure, That I Met Ya
I Could Get Ya On The First Time
[Rihanna-Chorus]
The First Time You Kissed My Lips
The First Time Your Finger Tips
Touchin' Me Couldn't Resist
I Knew I Was Meant For This
The First Time You Held Me Close
The First Time I Couldn't Say No
So Lost In Side Of You
I Knew I Was Meant For You
[Fabolous - Verse 2]
Now I Remeber Datin The First Time Was Intimidatin
No Rush Tho I Spent The Whole November Waitin
C'mon Look At The Patients That I'm Demonstratin
After A Week Or Two I Usually Start Eliminatin
But We Got Through The Convo On The Phone
Now We Finally Chillin In The Condo All Alone
I Tried To Be Expressive Widout Bein Aggressive
Jus Bein Suggestive A Lil More Impressive
And I'm A Good Player I Listen To The Coach
He Showed Me The Play Book And Said This Is The Approach If You Eva Wanna Score
Cause Some Player Rush They Shoots And Thats Why They Neva On The Floor
And Thats Why We Both Feel Comfortable
Like Long Time Friends Only Been A Month Or Two
I Got Moves And I Know When To Make Um
But I Only Give Um If I Know You Can Take Um
(uh oh)
[Rihanna-Chorus]
The First Time You Kissed My Lips
The First Time Your Finger Tips
Touchin' Me Couldn't Resist
I Knew I Was Meant For This
The First Time You Held Me Close
The First Time I Couldn't Say No
So Lost In Side Of You
I Knew I Was Meant For You
[Fabolous Verse 3]
Now Before The First Time We Laid Down In The Bed
You Aint Know The Kinda Things Thad Played Around In My Head
I Aint Played Round When I Said "You Gon Rememba This"
Might Even Turn Ya Self On When Ya Reminisce
Our First Time We Were Like Virgins Wid Experience
A Lil Shy But I Urged You To Experiment
Things Got Wetter (oh) I Mean Better
(oh) I'm Gettin Numb I'm About Ta Cu-Cu-Cu-Cu-
Come On Now Not Yet Boo Slow Down
We Just Stepped In The Ring We Need A Few More Rounds
Thats The First Time It Felt Like That
Now You Know Why Fabolous Is Spelled Like That (yea)
[Rihanna-Chorus ]
The First Time You Kissed My Lips
The First Time Your Finger Tips
Touchin' Me Couldn't Resist
I Knew I Was Meant For This
The First Time You Held Me Close
The First Time I Couldn't Say No
So Lost In Side Of You
I Knew I Was Meant For You
[Rihanna-Chorus ]
The First Time You Kissed My Lips
The First Time Your Finger Tips
Touchin' Me Couldn't Resist
I Knew I Was Meant For This
The First Time You Held Me Close
The First Time I Couldn't Say No
So Lost In Side Of You
I Knew I Was Meant For You
