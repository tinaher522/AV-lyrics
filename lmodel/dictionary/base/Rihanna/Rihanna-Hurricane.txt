Hurricane
Rihanna, Rupee uh
Warning, warning! The hurricanes coming
So all your haters out there, yes you better start running
Lock your doors protect your homes
The hurricanes coming through the microphone
Blowing up right through your zone 
Coming straight toward your throne (coming straight for your throne)
Hurricane it's the hurricane (hurricane it's the hurricane)
Blowing holes right through your brain
Hurricane it's the hurricane
Hurricane
(Kill it Rihanna, yo)
Straight out the Carribean sea
You know you gotta feel me
I'm a 1,2,3,4,5 category, and I'm so deadly
Come from the land of Barbados
And you know that I'm more dangerous
I'm coming for the come gonna huff and a puff and blow your house down
You've got to dig this one
Tell them all to run
When it's said and done,
I'll be a champion,
Moving strong and fast,
The industry's forecast
Just put me first and the rest of them last (and the rest of them last)
And the rest of them last (come on girl, uh)
Hurricane it's the hurricane (hurricane hurricane)
Blowing holes right through your brain (straight through your brain)
Hurricane it's the hurricane 
Hurricane
So you better be warned
Don't be fooled by the eye of the storm
Cuz when you least expect
Imma creep right in
You best protect your nest
So whoever you are (are)
No matter near or far (far), 
Just check your radar,
And look out for Rihanna
You've got to dig this one
Tell them all to run
When it's said and done,
I'l be the champion
Warning, warning! (this is a warning)
Warning, warning! (Rupee, Rihanna)
(coming straight out of Barbados)
