<song artist="Rihanna" title="Take_A_Bow_(Remix)">
(feat. RizzIKidd)
Oh oh How bout a round of applause
A standing ovation
Ohohoh yeah yeah yeah yeah
You look so dumb right now
Standin outside my house
Tryin to apologize
You're so ugly when you cry
(Please)
Just cut it out
[Chorus]
Don't tell me you're sorry cause you're not
Baby when I know you're only sorry you got caught
But you put on quite a show
Really had me going
But now it's time to go
Curtain's finally closin
That was quite a show
Very entertainin
But it's over now
(But it's over now)
Go on and take a bow
Grab your clothes and get gone
(You better hurry up) before the sprinklers come on
(come on)
Talkin' bout, girl, I love you, you're the one
This just looks like a re-run
Please, what else is on
[Chorus]
And don't tell me you're sorry cuz you're not
Baby when I know you're only sorry you got caught
But you put on quite a show
You really had me goin
But now it's time to go
Curtain's finally closin
That was quite a show
Very entertainin
But it's over now
(But it's over now)
Go on and take a bow
And the award for the best liar goes to you
(Goes to you)
For make'n me believe that you could be
Faithful to me
Lets hear your speech out
(RizzIKidds verse)
If I could do it all again I'd Promise you my heart
Let our love shine bright never settle for sparks
Stand right by your side no matter what people say
Make sweet passionate love every time we lay
Look you deep in your eyes and just hold you close
Give you all of my love never settle for most
Miss you everytime you leave and wait for you to come home
We would stay up all night and sweet talk on the phone
Never leave and come back never leave you alone
Not afarid to show our love girl its always shown
Everytime you leave the room your love would linger
I'll give you what you always wanted and put this ring on your finger
How about a round of applause
A standing ovation
[Chorus]
But you put on quite a show
You really had me goin
But now it's time to go
Curtain's finally closin
That was quite a show
Very entertainin
But it's over now
(But it's over now)
Go on and take a bow
But it's over now
