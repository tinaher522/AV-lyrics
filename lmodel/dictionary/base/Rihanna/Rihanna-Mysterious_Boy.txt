<song artist="Rihanna" title="Mysterious_Boy">
I've been lost, widely exaggerated,
Confused, thinking what to do.
Setting myself free as pain dawns to me,
Waiting for a true one to cast the spell away.
Locked up, my ideas from behind,
Wanting them to bloom out of my mind
And then have someone so kind.
If you want to hold me dear,
Let me know you, have no fear.
Please don't let me feel so blue, having no exact clue.
Mysterious boy,when will you be known to me
That i may see what you want me to see.
You intimately erase my dullness,
With all of your promises.
I want to turn to you when i feel frail,
Having no comfort at all.
Deeply, emotionally expressed to you,
How you might change what you tend to do.
If to me you need to prove,
I might exactly help you make that move
Like doing such just to groove.
Mysterious boy, mysterious boy,
Hope you're not locked up too.
I'm certain you're just way out there,
Do these things if you really care.
Mysterious boy, present yourself infront of me,
I'll blow my kisses your way so tenderly.
