<song artist="Rihanna" title="Like_It">
You know you thrill me
Seconds of everyday
Biting on my body
Feel like another day
It must be magic
To make them disappear
Erase the past
You made the future clear
I like how you thrill me (thrill me)
You made me love you (love you)
Your just like a pill to me
You love to drug me (drug me)
Calls are lovely (lovely)
Don't know what you do to me
But I know how much I
Like it, like it
How much I
Like it, like it
How much I
Like it, like it, I like it
But I know how much I
Like it (like it) like it (like it)
Like it (like it) like it (like it)
Like it (like it) like it (like it)
I Like it (like it) like it (like it)
Your like the clouds
Breaking out all the dawn
Cleared out the path
All I can see was sun
Running through me
Feels like this is destiny (yea)
I'm suffocating
When you too far from me
I like how you thrill me (thrill me)
You made me love you (love you)
Your just like a pill to me
You love to drug me (drug me)
Calls are lovely (lovely)
Don't know what you do to me
But I know how much I
Like it, like it
How much I
Like it, like it
How much I
Like it, like it, I like it
But I know how much I
Like it (like it) like it (like it)
Like it (like it) like it (like it)
Like it (like it) like it (like it)
I Like it (like it) like it (like it)
I don't want to need u
But to please me completely
And I never wanted anything this way
Your just like a love that can't escape
Stare at the lights get lost in time
My reflections in the mirror I don't know (I don't know)
U make me lose on something (lose composure when u go)
It's your hallucination that make me wanna go
Must be your function got me bouncing off the walls
My reflections in the mirror I don't know (baby I don't know)
U make me lose on something (lose composure when u go)
It's your hallucination that make me wanna go (baby, you got me)
Must be your function got me bouncing off the walls
But I know how much I
Like it, like it
How much I
Like it, like it
How much I
Like it, like it, I like it
But I know how much I
Like it (like it) like it (like it)
Like it (like it) like it (like it)
Like it (like it) like it (like it)
I Like it (like it) like it (like it)
