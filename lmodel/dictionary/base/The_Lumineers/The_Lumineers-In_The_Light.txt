<song artist="The_Lumineers" title="In_The_Light">
I don't know why I just can't let it go
I don't know why I just can't let it go
Memory's old but I just can't let it go
The idea's gone but I just can't let it go
Time, give me my yesterdays
Save it for all you had in your eyes, I have gone away
Fate dealt you a tricky hand,
Now you're just left alone in your mind
And I have gone away
I don't know why I just can't let it go
Memory's old but I just can't let it go
In the light, right here in the light
Right here in the - hold me and don't you ever let this die
Right here in the light, and in the day time
Right here in the - hold me and don't you ever let this die
In the light, and in the daytime, right here in the
