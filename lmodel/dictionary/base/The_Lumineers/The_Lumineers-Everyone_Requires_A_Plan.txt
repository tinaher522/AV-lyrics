<song artist="The_Lumineers" title="Everyone_Requires_A_Plan">
He whispers secrets through a thick mustache
And she listens to him flicks her cigarette's ash
And smoke hangs velvet curtains, and hides her lips
And she hopes to hell it's worth all her health risks
I know it was you
I know it was you
'Cause everyone requires a plan
I can give you
It's all been a sleight of hand
I know it was you
I know it was you
