<song artist="Zella_Day" title="Jameson">
Words are meant to be taught
Love's not meant to be lost
You said that if I'm happy you're cured
But I'm not
I know you have a delicate fate
You're a quiet man but in the worst way
I'm not a follower and I won't follow you down
Oh Jameson, you've had your fun
Stop holding him, I wanna be the one
I promise you, I'll treat him right
Don't wanna fight, you don't need him like I do
I waited in the street outside
Sat in my car till my tears dried
I'm justifying people with pain
Tonight
I watched your fingers point at the blame
It's the darkest of grey when you explain
I'm not a follower and I won't follow you down
Oh Jameson, you've had your fun
Stop holding him, I wanna be the one
I promise you, I'll treat him right
Don't wanna fight, you don't need him like I do
I know I'll be okay
Don't tell me where or which way you go
Find someone else to take my place
You want me but treat me like you don't
Oh Jameson, you've had your fun
Stop holding him, I wanna be the one
I promise you, I'll treat him right
Don't wanna fight, you don't need him like I do
