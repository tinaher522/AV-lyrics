<song artist="Zella_Day" title="Ace_Of_Hearts">
Caught you at midnight
Not in my right mind
What you're afraid of
Is where I just came from
An ugly confession
I think that I'm broken
When I try to be open
I get the feeling that I'm giving up on something I love, too much
The sweetest misery that's taking me, I'm lost in the rush
Because
Ever since you've been my ace of hearts
Hit me like a freight train in the dark
Come on baby take me far away
I wanna get so lost in the great escape
We shouldn't have to try
We shouldn't have to try so hard
We shouldn't have to try
We shouldn't have to try so hard
You think you can meet me
Alone on the side street
There's darkness between us
The moon is a witness
An ugly confession
I feel so unstable
When it's out on the table
I get the feeling that I'm giving up on something I love, too much
The sweetest misery that's taking me, I'm lost in the rush
Because
Ever since you've been my ace of hearts
Hit me like a freight train in the dark
Come on baby take me far away
I wanna get so lost in the great escape
We shouldn't have to try
We shouldn't have to try so hard
We shouldn't have to try
We shouldn't have to try so hard
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Shouldn't have to try so hard
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Shouldn't have to try so hard
Ever since you've been my ace of hearts
Hit me like a freight train in the dark
Come on baby take me far away
I wanna get so lost in the great escape
We shouldn't have to try
We shouldn't have to try so hard
We shouldn't have to try
We shouldn't have to try so hard
