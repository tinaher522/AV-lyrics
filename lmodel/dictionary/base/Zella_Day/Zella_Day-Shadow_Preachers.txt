<song artist="Zella_Day" title="Shadow_Preachers">
You got those scissors from the draw
You never dug so deep before
If I stop trying, we start dying
You're cutting me out, baby who you fighting?
Who you fighting?
Who you fighting?
You make we wanna love, hate, cry, take, every part of you
You make me wanna scream, burn, touch, learn, every part of you
Uuh, uuh, uuh, uuh, uuh, uuh
Uuh, uuh, uuh, uuh, uuh
Uuh, uuh, uuh, uuh, uuh
Uuh, uuh, uuh
I close my eyes, just close the door
You want a minute, I'll give you more
Maybe I don't want you either
We're both unsettled, nighttime creatures
Shadow preachers, nighttime creatures
You make we wanna love, hate, cry, take, every part of you
You make me wanna scream, burn, touch, learn, every part of you
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
You wanna break, you break alone
You wanna leave, you're on your own
You wanna break, you break alone
You wanna leave, you're on your own
You make we wanna love, hate, cry, take, every part of you
You make me wanna scream, burn, touch, learn, every part of you
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
