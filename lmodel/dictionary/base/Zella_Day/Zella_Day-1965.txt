<song artist="Zella_Day" title="1965">
You saw me spinning from the corner of your eye
You saw me spinnin' like it's 1965
You saw me spinnin' from the corner of your eye
And you touched my neck
You're a beauty baby child
I never had nobody touch me like I'm glass.
You had me spinnin' in the midnight summer grass.
I never had nobody touch me like I'm glass.
With a moon bird kiss.
Can we go back to the world we had?
With a love so sweet it makes me sad
Can we go back to the world we had?
It's the world we've been dreaming of
Can we go back to the world we had?
Cut like diamonds, we were made to last
Can we go back to the world we had
It's the World we've been dreaming of
You heard me singing like a vission from the past
You heard me singing from a flower paddled pad
You heard me singing like a vision from the past
Inside from your lips it's the heaven that we're in?
I felt forever when I laid upon your chest
Forever when you said I look my best
I felt forever when I laid upon your chest
In the August light...
Can we go back to the world we had?
With a love so sweet it makes me sad
Can we go back to the world we had?
It's the World we've been dreaming of
Can we go back to the world we had?
Cut like diamonds we were made to last
Can we go back to the world we had?
It's the World we've been dreaming of
I don't belong here
I don't belong here
I don't belong here
I don't belong here
You saw me spinning from the corner of your eye
You saw me spinning like it's 1965
You saw me spinning from the corner of your eye
In the August light...
I don't belong here
I don't belong here
I don't belong here
I don't belong here
Can we go back to the world we had?
With a love so sweet it makes me sad
Can we go back to the world we had?
It's the World we've been dreaming of
Can we go back to the world we had?
Cut like diamonds we were made to last
Can we go back to the world we had?
It's the World we've been dreaming of
