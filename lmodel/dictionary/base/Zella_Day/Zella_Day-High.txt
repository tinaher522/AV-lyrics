<song artist="Zella_Day" title="High">
We are high
I'm in love
We are high
Small town American light
We are fine
Feeling grown up
And I'm in love
And I'm crashing in your arms
You right in the sky tonight
East side is a paradise of you
You, you
Don't worry baby don't you cry
As long as we keep getting high
Keep burning like we're never gonna die
Fire baby, fire baby, love
Fire baby, fire baby, love
We are high
I'm in love
We are high
Fucked up American boys
Drinking right
We'll never give up
Cause where we're from
God is on our side
You right in the sky tonight
East side is a paradise of you
You, you
Don't worry baby don't you cry
As long as we keep getting high
Keep burning like we're never gonna die
Fire baby, fire baby, love
Fire baby, fire baby, love
Feeling like this and we're all alone
Feeling like this and we're all alone
Feeling like this and we're all alone
Feeling like this and we're all alone
Got me like this and we're all alone
Got me like this and we're all alone
Don't worry baby don't you cry
As long as we keep getting high
Keep burning like we're never gonna die
Fire baby, fire baby, love
Fire baby, fire baby, love
