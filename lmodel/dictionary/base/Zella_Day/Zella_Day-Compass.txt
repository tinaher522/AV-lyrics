<song artist="Zella_Day" title="Compass">
We can build a tree house in the pine trees
We can keep our secrets buried underneath
Wild flowers crushed between your fingers
Clinging to the wild things that raised us
Compass points your home,
Calling out from the east
Compass points you anywhere
Closer to me
If we make it out alive from the depths of the sea
Compass points you anywhere
Closer to me
Where you are, I will be
Miles high, in the deep
Where you are, I will be
Anywhere, in between
Take me to the garden of your ecstasy
Make myself a heaven from your falling leaves
Woven in the fabric of your tapestry
Cover me in honeysuckle memories
Compass points your home,
Calling out from the east
Compass points you anywhere
Closer to me
If we make it out alive from the depths of the sea
Compass points you anywhere
Closer to me
Where you are, I will be
Miles high, in the deep
Where you are, I will be
Anywhere, in between
I will take the pieces, put them back together
Even when the grass isn't green enough
Taking all the badges, build ourselves a mansion
Love you in the way that you needed love
Where you are, I will be
Where you are, I will be
Miles high, in the deep
Where you are, I will be
Anywhere, in between
