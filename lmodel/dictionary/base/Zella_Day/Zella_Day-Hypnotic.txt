<song artist="Zella_Day" title="Hypnotic">
Wanna be on the front line, 
Knotted up suit ties, 
Talking like a headstrong mama, 
Gotta picture in your wallet, 
Making me a habit, 
Wearing your vintage T-shirt, 
Tie ribbons on ya top hat. 
Telling me I'm all that, 
Just like the girls from ya home town, 
Sweet-blooded, and I'm stranded. 
See if I can stand it, 
Drinking in the shallow water. 
Magnetic, everything about you, 
You really got me now, 
You do it to me so well, 
Hypnotic taking over me. 
Make me feel like someone else, 
You got me talking in my sleep, 
I don't wanna come back down, 
I don't wanna touch the ground. 
Just like an ocean dug so deep, 
Hypnotic taking over me. 
White threads on my laces 
Stuck on the hinges, 
Swinging the door to the to the back yard. 
Got splinters, walking tight ropes spun like a bandage, 
Touch on the outer surface, 
Bright eyes of the solstice. 
Wherever your mind is headed for, a freight train city 
Locked up till youâ€™re moon lit. 
Brushing my hair back, 
Feeling ya lips on my cold neck. 
Magnetic, everything about you, 
You really got me now, 
You do it to me so well, 
Hypnotic taking over me. 
Make me feel like someone else, 
You got me talking in my sleep, 
I don't wanna come back down, 
I don't wanna touch the ground. 
Just like an ocean dug so deep, 
Hypnotic taking over me. 
Hypnotic taking over me. 
You do it to me so well, 
Hypnotic taking over me. 
Make me feel like someone else, 
You got me talking in my sleep, 
I don't wanna come back down, 
I don't wanna touch the ground. 
Just like an ocean dug so deep, 
Hypnotic taking over me. 
Hypnotic taking over me, 
Hypnotic taking over me.
