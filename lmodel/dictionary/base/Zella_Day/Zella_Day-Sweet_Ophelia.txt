<song artist="Zella_Day" title="Sweet_Ophelia">
Believe me now you're too young girl
Cherry pie with your gold curls
Growin' up like a grapevine
Wrapped around you in due time
O-woah O-woah O-woah O-woah
Sweet Ophelia,
When young blood escapes
Vows that break
Go up, up away
Sweet Ophelia,
When young blood escapes
Vows that break
Go up, up away
Up, up away
Up, up away
Singing like it's a full moon (Singing like it's a full moon)
Careless now that he has you (Careless now that he has you)
Turns you on to the right songs (Turns you on to the right songs)
Promises that you're hooked on (Promises that you're hooked on)
O-woah O-woah O-woah O-woah
Sweet Ophelia,
When young blood escapes
Vows that break
Go up, up away
Sweet Ophelia,
When young blood escapes
Vows that break
Go up, up away
Up, up away
Up, up away
Sweet Ophelia,
When young blood escapes
Vows that break
Go up, up away
Sweet Ophelia,
When young blood escapes
Vows that break
Go up, up away
Sweet Ophelia,
When young blood escapes
Vows that break
Go up, up away
Up, up away
Up, up away
Up, up away
Up, up away
