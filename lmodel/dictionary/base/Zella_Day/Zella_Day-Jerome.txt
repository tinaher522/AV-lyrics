<song artist="Zella_Day" title="Jerome">
When I was 17, my father said to me
A wealthy man had the things I wanted
[?] diamond ring, the house he built for me
I made a promise to keep them haunted and I
Blue dress, satin black, taking every piece of my soul
Blue dress, faded black, look me in the eye as they close
Jerome, Jerome
Jerome, why you treat me so cold
Jerome, Jerome
Jerome, the only love I've ever known
He was a quiet man
With blood stains on his hands
The silver kissed him with scars so heavy
I waited patiently, [?]
The desert echoes that drove me crazy
Blue dress, satin black, taking every piece of my soul
Blue dress, faded black, look me in the eye as they close
Jerome, Jerome
Jerome, why you treat me so cold
Jerome, Jerome
Jerome, the only love I've ever known
Hold me, I'm not breathing
Hold me, I'm not breathing
Taking every piece of my soul
Blue dress, faded black, look me in the eye as they close
Jerome, Jerome
Jerome, why you treat me so cold
Jerome, Jerome
Jerome, the only love I've ever known
Hold me, I'm not breathing
Hold me, I'm not breathing
Hold me, I'm not breathing
Hold me, I'm not breathing
Hold me, I'm not breathing
Hold me, I'm not breathing
