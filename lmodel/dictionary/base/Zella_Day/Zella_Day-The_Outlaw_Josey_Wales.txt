<song artist="Zella_Day" title="The_Outlaw_Josey_Wales">
Stealing money from the town
Storm's coming, and you've been running from the dark clouds
No one can catch you now
It's like no one, no one knows where you came from
It's like no one, no one knows where you came from
I believed it, in the end
I was mistaken
There was a fire on the horizon
Be the first one, to let you in
It's like no one, no one knows where you came from
It's like no one, no one knows where you came from
You use Missouri outlaw
Arrows wave the past behind
You use Missouri outlaw
Red horse chase until they die
Josey Wales, you're like Josey Wales
Josey Wales, you're like Josey Wales
Lived forever, stripes of gold
Took the living, reflect your face in every window
There's nothing, to hold you down
It's like no one, no one knows where you came from
It's like no one, no one knows where you came from
You use Missouri outlaw
Arrows wave the past behind
You use Missouri outlaw
Red horse chase until they die
Josey Wales, you're like Josey Wales
Josey Wales, you're like Josey Wales
You use Missouri outlaw
Arrows wave the past behind
You use Missouri outlaw
Red horse chase until they die
Josey Wales, you're like Josey Wales
Josey Wales, you're like Josey Wales
