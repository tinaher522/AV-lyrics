<song artist="John_Mayer" title="No_Brains">
Can't step in my way
head first in your love &amp; dismay
its like beating the day
it can't stop going out of my head
whatever this could be i'd never know,
i never said it'd be the end of our torpedo
i hate you today,
i can't find a way,
don't drag me down now,
[Chorus]
goodbye, i've had enough frustration
i won't get stuck, goodbye,
this dead end situation,
it's just not worth my time
[End Chorus]
it's all better today,
i never thought it would end up this way,
you got somethin' to say?
don't wanna hear it if it gets in my way
(halt)this confusion, wondering, so overwhelmed,
(halt) this illusion seems so clear,
(cant) find conclusion dissapointing evolution
not (all) things are what they appear
so whats the point of this hell?
i know you too well we're running backwards,
[Chorus]
while waiting so frustrating,
im so sick of,
all this tension not to mention,
im so sick of,
can't take it,
you won't make it,
just save yourself the struggle,
can't do this,
try for yourself 'cuz im just fine!
[Guitar Solo]
you speak for all of us when,
you can be heard
i'll bet you've had a lesson to know one word
(so sick of, feel so sick of)
you speak for all of us when,
you can be heard
i'll bet you've had a lesson to know one word
[Chorus]
while waiting so frustrating,
im so sick of,
all this tension not to mention,
im so sick of, sick of you!
