<song artist="John_Mayer" title="John_Mayer_-_St._Patricks_Day">
Here comes the cold
Break out the winter clothes
And find a love to call your own
You enter, your cheeks a shade of pink
And the rest of you in powder blue
Who knows what will be
But I'll make you this guarantee, see
No way November will see our goodbye
When it comes to December it's obvious why
No one wants to be alone at Christmas time
In the dark, on the phone
You tell me the names of your brothers
And your favorite colors, I'm learning you
And when it snows again, we'll take a walk outside
And search the sky like children do, I say to you
No way November will see our goodbye
When it comes to December it's obvious why
No one wants to be alone at Christmas time
And come January we're frozen inside
Making new resolutions a hundred times
February, won't you be my valentine?
And we'll both be safe till St. Patrick's Day
We should take a ride tonight around the town
And look around at all the beautiful houses
Something in the way that blue lights
On a black night can make you feel more
Everybody, it seems to me
Just wants to be just like you and me
No one wants to be alone at Christmas time
Come January we're frozen inside
Making new resolutions a hundred times
February, won't you be my valentine?
And if our always is all that we gave
And we someday take that away
I'll be alright if it was just till St. Patrick's Day
