<song artist="John_Mayer" title="Wait_Until_Tomorrow">
Well, I'm standing here, freezing, outside your golden garden
Uh got my ladder, leaned up against your wall
Tonight's the night we planned to run away together
Come on Dolly Mae, there's no time to stall
But now you're telling me...
I think I better wait till tomorrow
I think I better wait till tomorrow
I think I better wait till tomorrow
Got to make sure it's right, so until tomorrow, goodnight.
Oh, Dolly Mae, how can you hang me up this way ?
Oh, on the phone you said you wanted to run off with me today
Now I'm standing here like some turned down serenading fool
Hearing strange words stutter from the mixed mind of you
And you keep tellin' me that ah...
I think we better wait till tomorrow
I think we better wait till tomorrow
Don't have to wait, Don't have to wait
I think we better wait till tomorrow
Got to make sure it's right, until tomorrow, goodnight, oh.
Ow ! Dolly Mae, girl, you must be insane
So unsure of yourself leaning from your unsure window pane
Do I see a silhouette of somebody pointing something from a tree ?
Click bang, what a hang, your daddy just shot poor me
And I hear you say, as I fade away...
We don't have to wait till tomorrow
We don't have to wait till tomorrow
We don't have to wait till tomorrow
Won't be around, Won't be around, Won't be around...
