<song artist="John_Mayer" title="Assassin">
I work in the dead of night
When the roads are quiet
And no one is around
To track my moves
Racing the yellow lights
To find the gate is open
She's waiting in the room
I just slip on through
You get in, you get done
And then you get gone
You never leave a trace
Or show your face, you get gone
Should have turned around
And left before the sun came up again
But the sun came up again
Enter the morning light
To find the day is burning
The curtains and the wine
In a little white room
No, I'm not alone
Her head is heavy on me
She's sleeping like a child
What could I do?
You get in, you get done
And then you get gone
You never leave a trace
Or show your face, you get gone
Should have turned around
And left before the sun came up again
But the sun came up again
I was a killer, was the best they'd ever seen
I'd steal your heart before you ever heard a thing
I'm an assassin and I had a job to do
Little did I know that girl was an assassin too
Suddenly I'm in
Over my head and
I can hardly breathe
Suddenly I'm floating
Over her bed and
I feel everything
Suddenly I know
Exactly what I did
But I cannot move a thing
Suddenly I know
Exactly what I done
And what it's gonna mean to me
Mean to me
I'm gone
I was a killer, was the best they'd ever seen
I'd steal your heart before you ever heard a thing
I'm an assassin and I had a job to do
Little did I know that girl was an assassin too
She's an assassin and
She's an assassin and
She's an assassin and
She's an assassin and she had a job to do
