<song artist="John_Mayer" title="Born_And_Raised_(Reprise)">
Born and raised
Locks of brown and streaks of grey
I was brought up in brighter days
It's good to say
Now I'm born and raised
Born and raised
In half the time I'll be twice my age
Better learn how to turn the page
'Cause time is strange
When you're born and raised
Born and raised
Locks of brown and streaks of grey
I was brought up in brighter days
It's good to say
Now I'm born and raised
Now I'm born and raised
