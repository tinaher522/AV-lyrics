Freshman year, 
Mom asks "What do you want to do 
when you get out of here?"
I said, "Well, gee, I'm only 13,
but I think I'd like to play my guitar...
be a star."
"Well," she said, "that's not it,
you got time to go.
Good sense will kick in anytime, you know.
I'm not worried, I'm not worried."
Sophomore year,
she asked the same old thing,
my answer had remained unchanged.
I saw her fidget with her thumbs.
She said, "You like computers, John,
you like computers, don't you?
Yeah, I always see you with computers...
you like computers
maybe you could do something with computers.
Yeah, wouldn't that be nice?"
Junior year,
It's a little more intense,
She says, "What do you want to do with your life?"
I'm not on the fence, I know exactly what I aim to be,
and I'm only 17.
She said, "Well, all I ask, is that you pay attention in class,
so if you happen to change your mind in time,
you can still go somewhere reputable...
do us proud."
So I went downstairs,
and I played guitar loud.
Yeah, senior year,
Same old question,
She said, "What do you want to do?"
I said, "Play my guitar and sing."
She said, "There's no such thing."
She said, "There's no such thing..."
(speaking: I love you Mom)
"Welcome to the real world", she said to me
Condescendingly
Take a seat, take your life
Plot it out in black and white
Well, I never lived the dreams of the prom kings
And the drama queens
I'd like to think the best of me
Is still hiding up my sleeve
They love to tell you
Stay inside the lines
But something's better
On the other side
I wanna run through the halls of my high school
I wanna scream at the top of my lungs
I just found out there's no such thing as the real world
Just a lie you've got to rise above
So the good boys and girls take the so called right track
Faded hats
Grabbing credits
and maybe  transfers
They listen to Phish, but they can't find the answers
And all of our parents
They're getting older
I wonder if they've wished for anything better
While in their memories
Tiny tragedies
They love to tell you
Stay inside the lines
Well, well something's better
On the other side
I wanna run through the halls of my high school
I wanna scream at the top of my lungs
I just found out there's no such thing as the real world
Just a lie you got to rise above
I am invincible..
You are invincible.. (yeah you are)
We are invincible..
As long as we're alive
Do I have to tell a story
of a thousand rainy days
since we first met?
It's a big enough umbrella
but it's always me 
that ends up getting wet.
I wanna run through the halls of my high school
I wanna scream at the top of my lungs
I just found out there's no such thing as the real world
Just a lie you've got to rise above
I just can't wait til my 10 year reunion
I'm gonna bust down the double doors
And when I stand on these tables before you
You will know what all this time was for
