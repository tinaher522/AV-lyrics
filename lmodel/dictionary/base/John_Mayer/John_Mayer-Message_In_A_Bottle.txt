<song artist="John_Mayer" title="Message_In_A_Bottle">
Just cast away and I am lost at sea
Another lonely day and no one here but me
More loneliness than any man could bear
Rescue me before I fall into despair
I send an S.O.S. to the world
I send an S.O.S. to the world
I hope that someone gets my 
I hope that someone gets my
I hope that someone gets my 
Message in a bottle
Message in a bottle
Message in a bottle
A year has passed since I wrote my note
I should have known this right from the start
Only hope can keep me together
Love can mend your life but love can break your heart
I send an S.O.S. to the world
I send an S.O.S. to the world
I hope that someone gets my
I hope that someone gets my
I hope that someone gets my
Message in a bottle
Message in a bottle
Message in a bottle, bottle
Walked out this morning I don't believe what I saw
A hundred billion bottles washed up on the shore
Seems I'm not alone in being alone
A hundred billion castaways, looking for a home
I send an S.O.S. to the world
I send an S.O.S. to the world
I hope that someone gets my
I hope that someone gets my
I hope that someone gets my
Message in a bottle 
Message in a bottle
Message in a bottle
Sending out an S.O.S.
(repeats until end)
