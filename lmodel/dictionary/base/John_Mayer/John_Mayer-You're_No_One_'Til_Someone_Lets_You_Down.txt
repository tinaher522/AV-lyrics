<song artist="John_Mayer" title="You're_No_One_'Til_Someone_Lets_You_Down">
No I've not seen you this way before
Standing a mess at my door
Well it took you so long
But you finally found
You're no one 'til someone lets you down
You believed that all people were kind
And that she'd never mess with your mind
You gave her your trust and she busted your crown
You're no one 'til someone lets you down
Yes I've been told, that some people grow old
Without losing a part of their soul
But if that is true I don't wish it on you
There's so much to adore in a heart that is blue
There's a light in your eyes that is pure
That you won't give away any more
But just think of the things we can talk about now
You're no one 'til someone lets you down
Yes I have heard
There are some who avoid
All the pain that will come with the fall
But if that's the case, it would surely erase
All the joy that you feel when the hurt fades away
There's a hard ticket train on the way
Waiting to take you away
Will you please keep in mind when it pulls into town
You're no one 'til someone lets you down
You're no one 'til someone lets you down
You're no one 'til someone lets you down
