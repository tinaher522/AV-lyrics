<song artist="John_Mayer" title="Love_Is_A_Verb">
Love is a verb
It ain't a thing
It's not something you hold
It's not something you scream
When you show me love
I don't need your words
Yeah, love ain't a thing
Love is a verb
Love ain't a thing
Love is a verb
Love ain't a crutch
It ain't an excuse
No you can't get through love
On just a pile of IOUs
Love ain't a drug
Despite what you've heard
Yeah, love ain't a thing
Love is a verb
Love ain't a thing
Love is a verb
So you gotta show me
Love is a verb
