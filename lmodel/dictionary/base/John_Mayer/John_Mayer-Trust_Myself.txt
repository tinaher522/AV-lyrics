<song artist="John_Mayer" title="Trust_Myself">
Hold on to whatever you find, baby
Hold on to whatever will get you through
Hold on to whatever you can, baby
Cause I don't trust myself when I'm loving you
I'm not the man I used to be
I haven't told it to my heart just yet
I will talk my love a thousand roses
I might leave it on the water...
Hold onto whatever you get, baby
Hold onto whatever will get you through
Don't know how much longer I'll be here, babe
Cause I don't trust myself
Loving you
Say, who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
You better call oh my... 
You better call oh my...
I won't talk myself forever in your arms
And then I'll whistle to get out when I'm there
Cause I can't tell you what I think I really want
Cause when it comes down to it, I don't really care
I don't even care anymore
Hold onto whatever you want, baby
Hold onto whatever will get you through
Don't know how much longer I'll be around, baby
Cause I don't trust myself when I'm loving you
Say it now, who do you love?
I gotta get proof
Everyone's loving
I've been waiting my life
Oooooh
Hold on to whatever you want, baby
Hold on to whatever will get you through
Leave right now, I'm tired of talking baby
Cause I don't trust myself loving you
Hold onto whatever you want, baby
Hold onto what you thought you needed
The wind round here blows everything away
And I don't trust myself on loving you
I don't trust myself on loving you
I don't trust myself on loving you
I don't trust myself on loving you
