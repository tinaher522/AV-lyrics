<song artist="John_Mayer" title="Wheel_(Live)">
People have the right to fly
And when it gets compromised
Their hearts say "Move along" 
Their minds say "Gotcha heart"
Let's move it along 
Let's move it along 
And airports 
See it all the time
With someone's last goodbye
Blends in with someone's sigh
Cause someone's coming home
In hand a single rose 
And that's the way this wheel keeps working now
That's the way this wheel keeps working now
And I won't be the last
No I won't be the last,
To love her
And you can't build a house of leaves
And live like it's an evergreen
It's just a season thing
It's just this thing that seasons do
And that's the way this wheel keeps working now
That's the way this wheel keeps working now
And you won't be the first
No you won't be the first 
To love me
You can find me, if you ever want to give
I'll be around the bend 
I'll be around the bend
I'll be around, 
I'll be around
And if you never stop when you wave goodbye
You just might find if you give it time
You will wave hello again 
You just might wave hello again 
And that's the way this wheel keeps working now
That's the way this wheel keeps working now
You can't love too much, one part of it (repeat then fade)
I believe that my life's gonna see
The love I give 
Return to me
I believe that my life's gonna see
The love I give 
Return to me
I believe that my life's gonna see 
The love I give 
Return to me (repeat 1x)
