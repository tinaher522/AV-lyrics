<song artist="John_Mayer" title="Wildfire">
River's strong, you can't swim inside it
We could string some lights up the hill beside it
Tonight the moon's so bright you could drive with your headlights out
'Cause a little bit of summer's what the whole year's all about
You look fine, fine, fine
Put your feet up next to mine
We can watch that water line get higher and higher
Say, say, say ain't it been some kind of day
You and me been catching on like wildfire
Don't get up just to get another
You can drink from mine
We can't leave each other
We can dance with the dead
You can rest your head
On my shoulder if you
Want to get older with me
'Cause a little bit of summer makes a lot of history
And you look fine, fine, fine
Put your feet up next to mine
We can watch that water line get higher and higher
Say, say, say ain't it been some kind of day
You and me been catching on like wildfire
I got a rock from the river in my medicine bag
(Magpie feather in his medicine bag)
Say, say, say ain't it been some kind of day
You and me been catching on like wildfire
