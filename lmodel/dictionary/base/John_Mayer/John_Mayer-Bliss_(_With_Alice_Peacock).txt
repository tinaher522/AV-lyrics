<song artist="John_Mayer" title="Bliss_(_With_Alice_Peacock)">
Your touch is electric
I felt it the first time you held me
The way we connected
So easily
I've tried to define it
Searched for the perfect phrase
I've tried to describe it
In a million different ways
(chorus)
It's joy, it's ecstacy, it's truth, it's destiny
And even love is not enough to tell you how you make me feel
There's only one word for this
I've got to admit it
You took my heart by surprise
Don't know how you did it
But baby, I've never felt so alive
(chorus)
It's joy, it's ecstacy, it's truth, it's destiny
And even love is not enough to tell you how you make me feel
There's only one word for this
It's bliss
Hey, you know, baby, know what the future holds
As long as you're here with me
(chorus)
It's joy, it's ecstacy, it's truth, it's destiny
And even love is not enough to tell you how you make me feel
It's faith, it's honesty, it's life, it's everything
To say "I love you"'s not enough to tell you how you make me feel
It's in your smile, in your kiss
It's the reason that I exist
There's only one word for this
It's bliss
It's bliss
It's bliss
