<song artist="John_Mayer" title="On_The_Way_Home">
The summer's over
This town is closing
They're waving people
Out of the ocean
We had the feeling
Like we were floating
We never noticed
Where time was going
Do you remember
When we first got here?
The days were longer;
The nights were hot here
Now it's September
The engine's started
You're empty-handed
And heavy-hearted
Just remember on the way home
That you were never meant to feel alone
It takes a little while but you'll be fine
Another good time coming down the line
You'll go back to love that's waiting
I'll unpack in a rented room
How's that life you swear you're hating?
Grass is greener, that makes two
Just remember on the way home
That you were never meant to feel alone
You just look me up
Get back on the bus
I'll see you next week
If you're needing my trust
Life ain't short but it sure is small
You get forever but nobody at all
Life ain't short but it sure is small
You get forever but nobody at all
Don't come often and it don't stay long
Just remember on the way home
That you don't ever have to feel alone
Just stay on the run
Get off the grid
And hide yourself out like you know that I did
And if you might find your running is done
A little bit of heaven never hurt no one
