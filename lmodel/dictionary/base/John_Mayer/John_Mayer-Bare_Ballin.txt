<song artist="John_Mayer" title="Bare_Ballin">
There's a new sensation 
Sweeping all the nation
And they're calling it
Bare ballin it, bare ballin it
Well I seem to have forgotten
the crucial layer of cotton 
We're all in it, we're all in it 
We're bare ballin it
There's nothing that you don't see
After my jeans it's only just me
Call me a Fleshy Fernando
I'm goin commando!
I'm ballin it.
There's a new sensation 
Sweeping all the nation
And they're calling it
Bare ballin it
