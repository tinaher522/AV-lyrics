<song artist="John_Mayer" title="Inner_City_Blues_(Make_Me_Wanna_Holler)">
Rockets, moon shots
Spend it on the have nots
Money, we make it
Fore we see it you take it
Oh, make me wanna holler
The way they do my life
Make me wanna holler
The way they do my life
This ain't livin', This ain't livin'
Inflation no chance
To increase finance
Bills pile up sky high
Send that boy off to die
Oh, make me wanna holler
The way they do my life
Make me wanna holler
The way they do my life
This ain't livin', This ain't livin'
Hang ups, let downs
Bad breaks, set backs
Natural fact is
Oh honey that I can't pay my taxes
Oh, make me wanna holler
And throw up both my hands
Make me wanna holler
And throw up both my hands
This ain't livin', This ain't livin'
Crime is increasing
Trigger happy policing
Panic is spreading
God knows where we're heading
Oh, make me wanna holler
They don't understand
Oh, make me wanna holler
They don't understand
This ain't livin', This ain't livin'
