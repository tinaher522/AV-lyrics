<song artist="John_Mayer" title="Comfortable">
I just remembered that time at the market
Snuck up behind me and jumped on my shopping cart
And rolled down aisle five
You looked behind you to smile back at me
Crashed into a rack full of magazines
They asked us if we could leave
Can't remember what went wrong last September
Though I'm sure you'd remind me if you had to
Our love was comfortable and so broken in
I sleep with this new girl I'm still getting used to
My friends all approve, say "she's gonna be good for you"
They throw me high fives
She says the Bible is all that she reads
And prefers that I not use profanity
Your mouth was so dirty
Life of the party and she swears that she's artsy
But you could distinguish Miles from Coltrane
Our love was comfortable and so broken in
She's perfect
So flawless
Or so they say, hey
say, hey
She thinks I can't see the smile that she's faking
And poses for pictures that aren't being taken
I loved you
Grey sweatpants
No makeup
So perfect
Our love was comfortable and so broken in
She's perfect
So flawless
I'm not impressed
I want you back
