<song artist="John_Mayer" title="Wheel">
People have the right to fly
And will when it gets compromised
Their hearts say 'move along'
Their minds say 'gotcha heart'
'Let's move it along'
And airports see it all the time
Where someone's last goodbye
Blends in with someone's sigh
Cause someone's coming home
In hand a single rose
And that's the way this wheel keeps working now
That's the way this wheel keeps working now
And I won't be the last
No I won't be the last
To love her
You can't build a house of leaves
And live like it's an evergreen
It's just a season thing
It's just this thing the seasons do
And that's the way this wheel keeps working now
That's the way this wheel keeps working now
And you won't be the first
No you won't be the first
To love me
You can find me
If you ever want again
I'll be around the bend
I'll be around the bend
I'll be around 
And if you never stop when you wave goodbye
You just might find if you give it time you will wave hello again
You just might wave hello again
And that's the way this wheel keeps working now
That's the way this wheel keeps working now
You can't love too much one part of it
You can't love too much one part of it
I believe that my life's gonna see
The love I give returned to me
