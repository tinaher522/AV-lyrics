<song artist="John_Mayer" title="Tracing">
do you ever get the feelin
that we started in the middle?
or have you ever had the sense 
that weve been lying just a little?
i mean come on
its not like weve known ourselves that long
and i cant say i really blame you for being bored with the beginning
always staring at the score to figure out whos barely winning
but dont you know
there is a reason strong, move slow
and im okay
if youre okay with wasting time
but when you trace
you always see the bottom line
we are tracing
i hope you know
we are tracing
and if you want to know the moment 
i knew that i was still alone
i found i never learned your number 
i only stored it in my phone
youd think by now
id know the shape of calling home
and im okay
if youre okay with wasting time
but when you trace
you always see the bottom line
we are tracing
i hope you know
we are tracing
were both alone
we are tracing
we are tracing
did you ever get the feeling 
that we started in the middle?
or have you ever had the sense 
that weve been lying just a little?
i mean come on
its not like weve knew ourselves that long
