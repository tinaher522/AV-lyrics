<song artist="John_Mayer" title="Fine_With_Me_(with_Dave_Matthews_Band)">
I must admit
I can't remember your name
I know we just met,
But since then I've had a lot to think about
Before we part ways, well, there's something that I'd like to say
I realize it's late
But if you'll hear out I'm sure
Dave Letterman can wait
And if you'd like to
Maybe continue, what we started with a smile 
From across the room
That'd be fine with me
When I first saw
Your face, I knew for sure
That from now on
Things would be different than before
I walk in weak 
From yet another day
I need you to say
That tomorrow I'm gonna hear your voice again
And if you'd like to, maybe continue,
What we started with a smile from across the room
That'd be fine with me
And I only hope that I can be what you were looking for 
Cause all I ask is that you look my way
And that'd be fine with me
I know its clich√©d
To use silly metaphors to describe the way
You handle me
But, I'm just an addict
I'm just and addict
And I think I'm hooked on you
Anbd if you'd like to maybe continue
what we started with a smile from across the room 
that'd be fine with me 
And I only hope that I can be what you were looking for 
Cause all I ask is that you look my way 
And that'd be fine with me 
That'd be fine with me
