<song artist="John_Mayer" title="The_Hurt">
I'm a good man
in a dark room
in a big town
under a full moon
it's a friday and I'm almost home
I'm in a good place
full of head space
got a brand new pack in my suitcase
but it's dinner and then it's bed alone
How do you break a mended heart?
I'm bored and want something to do
I wanna fall, fall asleep
asleep in the arms, the arms of a woman
a woman who doesn't, doesn't deserve my love
I wanna lie, lie to myself
myself and someone else
just to feel something, something that hurts me
the hurt makes me feel alive
Gonna make it, like I need her
gonna miss her the moment I meet her
and it's only gonna get worse from there
I'll be rappin' there in the shower
she'll be here by the end of the hour
I can do better
but I can't do better now
How do you break a mended heart?
I'm bored and want something to do
I wanna fall, fall asleep
asleep in the arms, the arms of a woman
a woman who doesn't, doesn't deserve my love
I wanna lie, lie to myself
myself and someone else
just to feel something, something that hurts me
the hurt makes me feel alive
So long is over
nice to skip the chance you get to know you
why did I think this was true?
Because I want to
I wanna fall, fall asleep
asleep in the arms, the arms of a woman
a woman who doesn't, doesn't deserve my love
I wanna lie, lie to myself
myself and someone else
just to feel something, something that hurts me
the hurt makes me feel alive
I wanna fall
I wanna need
I wanna laugh, cry, say goodbye
beg, lie, cheat and steal
