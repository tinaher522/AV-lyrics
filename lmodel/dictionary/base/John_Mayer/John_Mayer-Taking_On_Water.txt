<song artist="John_Mayer" title="Taking_On_Water">
On a sailboat
I am slowly
Floating nowhere
Lost the memories
Of where I am and why
Black ocean churning
A million stars
Are burning
Planetariums were right
About the sky
Once upon a day
I set off on a journey
Wishing on the wind
Take me far from home
Now I'm on the waves
And I'm taking on water
Hard to see
I won't always be alone
There was a time
When August sun was high
And centered on me
But it did me on my back
And settled down
Used to scream
Through the land
Used to size it
In my head
But it fell
Behind the line
That leads to sky
Once upon a day
I set off on a journey
Wishing on the wind
Take me far from home
Now I'm on the waves
And I'm taking on water
Hard to see
I won't always be alone
Inside this storm
Whipping in the wind
My sail is torn
In other words
The ends
Are never not my own
Hard to see
I won't always be alone
I'm a sailboat out of here
Slowly floating nowhere
Then someday
I'll wash upon
Someone else's shore
