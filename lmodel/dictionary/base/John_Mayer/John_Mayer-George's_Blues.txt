Matt Mangano:I like to eat an orange with George Malacorange
I like to eat an orange 
with my friend George Malacorange
I like to eat an orange
with my friend George Malacorange
So juicy sweet
So good to eat 
an orange with George Malacorange
oooooooooo
Bop ba ba
I like to eat an orange 
with my friend George Malacorange
I like to eat an orange 
with my friend George Malacorange
So juicy sweet
So good to eat 
an orange with George Malacorange
George is my friend.
