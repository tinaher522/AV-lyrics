<song artist="John_Mayer" title="Break_Away">
if melody
is my destiny
then what's left of me,
i'll give to you..
and if next to me,
is all that you need to be
would you settle for fantasy,
if it's the best you could do?
can I have my cake?
can i have you too?
would you follow me?
could i ask you to?
would the world between us,
break these ties?
we worked so hard
to realize..
can a postcard say,
what i see in your eyes?
could i ever break away?
would i be satisfied,
and find peace inside
rolling half my life
over broken white lines?
can i have my cake,
can i have you too?
would you follow me,
could i ask you too?
will i wake up one morning,
and see your face
and the streaks on the window,
that the rainstorm makes?
could you bear all the waiting,
and the strength that it takes?
could i ever break away?
could i ever break away?
can i have my cake?
can i have you too?
would you follow me?
could i ask you to?
would the world between us,
break these ties?
we worked so hard to realize..
can a postcard say,
what i see in your eyes?
could i ever break away?
could i ever break away?
away...
away..
