<song artist="John_Mayer" title="Covered_In_Rain">
These days, with the world getting colder,
She spends more time sleeping over
Than I'd planned.
Tonight we're gonna order in,
Drinking wine and watchin CNN.
It's dark I know, but then again
It's the brightest thing I got
When I'm covered in rain
Now, I'm covered in rain, rain, rain, rain
From fireworks to fireplaces
Summer stole what fall replaces
And now we're people watching
All the people, people watching us right back
Standing by the missing signs
At the CVS, by the checkout line
She puts her quiet hands in mine,
Cause she's the brightest thing I've got
When I'm covered in rain
Cause I'm covered in rain, rain, rain, rain
Cause I'm covered in rain
No I'm covered in rain
And come December, Lydia left.
She mentioned something 'bout it being for the best,
And I can't say I disagree, and it's killing me.
And now I'm standing facing west
Tracing my fingers round a silhouette
I haven't gotten used to yet,
But it's the brightest thing I've got
When I'm covered in rain
Now, I'm covered in rain, rain
No, I'm covered in rain, rain, rain, rain
I'm covered in, covered in, covered in rain
