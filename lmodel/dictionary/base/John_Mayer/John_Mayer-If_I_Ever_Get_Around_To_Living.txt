<song artist="John_Mayer" title="If_I_Ever_Get_Around_To_Living">
If I ever get around to living
I'm gonna put my things away
In drawers and into closets
And there I'll stay
If I ever get around to living
It's gonna be just like I dreamed
I'm gonna take the love I'm given
And set it free
If I ever get around to living
I'll take the end of every day
Tie it up to every morning
And sail away
Maybe it's all a dream I'm having at seventeen
I don't have tattoos
And very soon, mother will be calling me
Saying "Come upstairs, you got some work to do"
When you gonna to wise up, boy
When you gonna to wise up, boy
When you gonna to wise up, boy
When you gonna to wise up, boy
You are hiding in your mind
Working all the time
Trying to make it better than you got it
And you are spending all your time
Searching for a sign
That's never gonna look the way you want it
When you gonna to wise up boy
When you gonna to wise up boy
When you gonna to wise up boy
When you gonna to wise up boy
