<song artist="John_Mayer" title="Fool_To_Love_You">
Oh, it takes a fool to love you
It takes a fool to love you
It takes a fool to love you
Oh, and I'm just the fool for you
I really did it to myself I guess
I saw you standing in that cocktail dress
Oh, call the press and say my life is a mess
Because I must confess to you
That it takes a fool to love you
It takes a fool to love you
It takes a fool to love you
Oh, and I'm just the fool for you
Fool me once, it's shame on you
But twice, it's shame on me
But fool me baby for the rest of my life
And I'll be happy, happy as a broken man can be
Cause it takes a fool
It takes a fool
It takes a fool to love you
Oh, and I'm just the fool for you
Oh now I'm just the fool for you
I'm just the fool for you
I'm just the fool for you
I'm just the fool for you
I'm just the fool for you
I'm just the fool for you
