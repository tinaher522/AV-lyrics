<song artist="John_Mayer" title="Patience">
Was a time when I wasn't sure
But you set my mind at ease
There is no doubt, you're in my heart now
Said, woman, take it slow, it'll work itself out fine
You and I've got what it takes to make it
Said, woman, take it slow and no, no, no, no, no
You and I got just a little patience
I sit here on the stairs 'cause I'd rather be alone
If I can't have you right now I'll wait dear
Sometimes I get so tense but I can't speed up the time
But you know love there's one more thing to consider
Said, woman, take it slow
And the lights are shinning bright
You no, no, no, no, no, no, ah baby
Said, woman, take it slow it'll work itself out fine
All we need is just a little patience
I wanna try and see if I can do this solo
Just a little patience, yeah
Some more patience, yeah
Goes like this, it goes like this
I been walkin' the streets at night just tryin' to get it right
Hard to see with so many around you know I don't like
Being stuck in the crowd and the streets don't change
But baby the name I ain't got time for the game
'Cause I need you, yeah, well I need you
Oo, well I need you, oo, I need you, oo, all this time
