<song artist="John_Mayer" title="War_Of_My_Life">
Come out angels
Come out ghosts
Come out darkness
Bring everyone you know
I'm not running and I'm not scared
I am waiting
And well-prepared
I'm in the war of my life
At the door of my life
Out of time and there's nowhere to run
I've got a hammer
And a heart of glass
I gotta know right now which walls to smash
I got a pocket
Got no pills
If fear hasn't killed me yet, then nothing will
All the suffering and all the pain
Never left a name
I'm in the war of my life
At the door of my life
Out of time and there's nowhere to run
I'm in the war of my life
At the core of my life
Got no choice but to fight till it's done
No more suffering, no more pain
Never again
I'm in the war of my life
At the door of my life
Out of time and there's nowhere to run
I'm in the ware of my life
At the core of my life
Got no choice but to fight till it's done
So fight on
Fight on everyone
Fight on
Got no choice but to fight till it's done
I won't give up
I won't run
I won't stop for anyone
