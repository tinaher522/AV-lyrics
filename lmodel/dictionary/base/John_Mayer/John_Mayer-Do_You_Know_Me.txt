<song artist="John_Mayer" title="Do_You_Know_Me">
It's just the strangest thing
I've seen you face somewhere
An early evening dream
A past life love affair
Do you know me at all?
Do you know me at all?
In all my revelry
I thought I felt us there
A feather in my hand
A flower in your hair
Do you know me at all?
Do you know me at all?
Do you know me at all?
Do you know me at all?
