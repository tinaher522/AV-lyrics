<song artist="John_Mayer" title="Closer_To_You">
How soft a whisper can get
When we're walking through a crowded space
I hear every word being said
I remember every day 
That I get a little bit closer to you, you
How long an hour can take
When you're staring into open space
When I feel I'm slippin further away
I'll remember that every day
I get a little bit closer to you, you
To you, you
These are the days I won't get back
I won't hear you cry or hear you laugh
But when it's quiet and I don't hear a thing
Well I can always hear you sing
There's no where else that I have wanted to be
Then be there when you needed me
I'm sorry too but don't give up on me
And just remember when you were asleep 
I got a little bit closer to you, you
To you, you
And then there's no where else I wanted to be
Then be there when you needed me
I'm sorry too but don't give up on me
And just remember when you were asleep 
I got a little bit closer to you
