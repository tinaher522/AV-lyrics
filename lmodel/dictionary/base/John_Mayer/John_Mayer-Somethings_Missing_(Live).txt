<song artist="John_Mayer" title="Somethings_Missing_(Live)">
I'm not alone, I wish I was.
'Cause then I'd know, I'm down because,
I couldn't find, a friend around
To love me like, they do right now.
They do right now.
All is well, I can't complain
We're okay, I guess I could
I got my place, I got my name
I changed my temp, All the same
I can't think about whats keeping me down.
Something's missing,
And I don't know how to fix it.
Something's missing,
And I don't know what it is, no I don't know what it is
I don't.
And autumn comes, it doesn't last.
It just walks in, where it left you last.
And you never know, when it starts
Until there's fog inside the glass around your summer heart.
I can't put my finger on what's keeping me down.
Something's missing,
And I don't know how to fix it.
Something's missing,
And I don't know what it is, no I don't know what it is now.
I can't be sure that this state of mind, is not of my own design
I wish there was an over the counter test, for loneliness.
For loneliness like this, La da.
Something's missing,
And I don't know how to fix it.
Something's missing,
And I don't know what it is, no I don't know what it is.
Friends, check. Money, check.
Good times, check. Guitar, check. 
All, check. All over you, check. 
Everyone, check. Having fun...
And I don't know what it is, no I don't know what it is
At all'.
(Spoken)
Thank you so much for humoring me when I play you a new one.
