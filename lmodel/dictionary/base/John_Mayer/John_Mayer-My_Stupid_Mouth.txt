My stupid mouth
Has got me in trouble
I said too much again
To a date over dinner yesterday
And I could see she was offended
She said "Well anyway..."
Just dying for a subject change
Oh, it's another social casualty
Score one more for me
How could I forget?
Mama said "Think before speaking"
No filter in my head
Oh, what's a boy to do
I guess he better find one soon
We bit our lips; She looked out the window
Rolling tiny balls of napkin paper
I played a quick game of chess
With the salt and pepper shaker
And I could see clearly
An indelible line was drawn
Between what was good, what just slipped out
And what went wrong
Oh, the way she feels about me has changed
Thanks for playing, try again
How could I forget?
Mama said "Think before speaking"
No filter in my head
Oh, what's a boy to do
I guess he better find one
I'm never speaking up again, it only hurts me
I'd rather be a mystery than she desert me
Oh I'm never speaking up again
Starting now
Starting now
One more thing
Why is it my fault?
So maybe I try too hard
But it's all because of this desire
I just wanna be liked, just wanna be funny
Looks like the joke's on me
So call me captain backfire
I'm never speaking up again, it only hurts me
I'd rather be a mystery than she desert me
Oh I'm never speaking up again
I'm never speaking up again
I'm never speaking up again
Starting now
Starting now
