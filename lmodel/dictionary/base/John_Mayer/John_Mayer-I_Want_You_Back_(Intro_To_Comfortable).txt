<song artist="John_Mayer" title="I_Want_You_Back_(Intro_To_Comfortable)">
I was cleaning up,
puttin' stuff away
when I found her there 
yesterday.
It was late,
you were drinking
the picture was dark yea 
we're both blinking' 
I want you back today. 
I thought u left your toothbrush here 
as a way to say 
I'll always be messing with you' 
(Goes into Comfortable)
