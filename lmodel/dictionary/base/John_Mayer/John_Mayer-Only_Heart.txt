<song artist="John_Mayer" title="Only_Heart">
Do not waste this evening
Baby I'm begging you
Your big imagination's playing its tricks on you
If you think my up and leaving's something I'm gonna do
Feel my chest when I look at you
Baby you
You got my only heart
Yah, you got my only heart
Yah, you got my only
Only heart
It's so hard to be so far out
Living our separate lives
Your phone was really broken
I tried your number twice
And if you need confirmation, baby I understand
It's alright if you want me to
Tell you you
You got my only heart
Yah, you got my only heart
Yah, you got my only
Only heart
And you love like your hand's on the horn, baby
I adore you but there's a hole in the cup that should hold your love
If you let me leave
I swear I never will
Remember now you
You've got my only heart
Yah, you got my only heart
Yah, you got my only
Only heart
