<song artist="John_Mayer" title="Friends,_Lovers_Or_Nothing">
Now that we are over as the loving kind
We'll be dreaming ways to keep the good alive
Only when we want is not a compromise
I'd be pouring tears into your drying eyes
Friends, lovers or nothing
There can only be one
Friends, lovers or nothing
There'll never be an in-between, so give it up
You whisper "come on over" 'cause you're two drinks in
But in the morning I will say goodbye again
Think we'll never fall into a jealous game?
The streets flood with blood of those who felt the same
Friends, lovers or nothing
There can only be one
Friends, lovers or nothing
There'll never be an in-between, so give it up
Friends, lovers or nothing
We can really only ever be one
Friends, lovers or nothing
We'll never be the in-between, so give it up
We'll never be the in-between, so give it up
Anything other than yes is no
Anything other than stay is go
Anything less than "I love you" is lying
