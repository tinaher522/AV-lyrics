<song artist="John_Mayer" title="Why_Did_You_Mess_With_Forever?">
I came by to get my things 
Thank you for getting the door 
But I don't feel right walking in no more
You think it's cold
I did my crying at home 
And I'm numb now,
I'm numb now 
Before I'm on my way 
I've one more thing to ask, 
Was it worth the price you paid 
For my never coming back? 
Why did you mess with forever? 
Ooh...
Such a long time 
To be unkind 
Why did you mess with forever? 
Don't you call me cruel 
Cruel is what you're making me do 
I stick to my rules 
I'm at odds with me now
So stay, go, go ahead and stay
Before I'm on my way 
I've one more thing to ask, 
Was it worth the price you paid 
For my never coming back 
Why did you mess with forever? 
Ooh...
Such a long time 
To be unkind 
Why did you mess with forever? 
You ask to kiss me once 'goodbye'
But you already did on somebody else's lips 
Ooh...
Tell the tiny chemicals 
The ones you hold responsible 
They lost me 
You lost me 
Now everything inside me tells me I should run to you 
And throw my arms around you 
Hold your streaming crying cheek against my own 
And tell you nothing's wrong 
But a wrong is what you were when you forgot 
That we were going on, 
We were going on 
We were going on 
Tell me why did you, 
Why did you mess with forever? 
Ooh...
What a long time 
To be unkind 
Why did you mess with forever?
Mmm....yeah
