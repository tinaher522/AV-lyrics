<song artist="John_Mayer" title="Man_On_The_Side">
six numbers, one more to dial
before i'm before you
i tried to call
been busy all night
gave up waiting at daylight
(chorus)
excuse me mrs. busy body
could you pencil me in
(when you can)
though we both know that the worst part about it
is that i would be free when you wanted me (if you wanted me)
oh oh oh
i am the man on the side
hoping you make up your mind
i am the one who will swallow his pride
life as the man on the side
one of the many
one of the few
to stand back and wait for you
repeat chorus
i fell in love with a dream that i built of you
playing the part of the queen
i'm taking my own advice
i'm giving up tonight
good luck to you and the king
repeat chorus
