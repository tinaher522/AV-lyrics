<song artist="John_Mayer" title="By_Nine">
There's a new world coming through
And theres nothing we can do
There's a new time, its coming by
All I want is mine
Gotta get out, gotta get out, gotta get out by nine 
Gotta get out, gotta get out, gotta get out alive
Gotta get out, gotta get out, gotta get out by nine
Gotta get out, gotta get out, gotta get out alive
On the road and the highway I drive
Your mine oh
Theres room to fly
Gotta get out sometime, gotta get out, gotta get out, gotta get out by nine
Gotta get out, gotta get out, gotta get out alive
Gotta get out, gotta get out, gotta get out by nine
Gotta get out, gotta get out, gotta get out alive
Its not my own way of getting down
Not the only time to stop and look around
Its means everything
Don't know where I am
Can't see nothing but I may have toÂ ??
Gotta get out, gotta get out, gotta get out by nine
Gotta get out, gotta get out, gotta get out alive
