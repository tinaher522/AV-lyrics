<song artist="John_Mayer" title="Little_Puppy">
Can't get over
My dog rover
Got run over
Four leaf clover
Not so lucky little puppy
You got f'd up by a trucky
Picked you up on a friday
You were flat on the driveway
If I could have it my way
You would have died on the highway
little puppy
la la la la
Little puppy
Picked you up on a friday
You were flat on the driveway (yes you were)
If I could have it my way
You would have died on the highway (On the highway)
You would have died, 
You would have died on the highway
Now there's a big spot on my driveway
I can't seem to scrub it off
Oh no, no, no
