<song artist="John_Mayer" title="Born_And_Raised">
Now and then I pace my place
I can't retrace how I got here
I cheat the light to check my face
It's slightly harder than last year
Then all at once it gets hard to take
It gets hard to fake what I won't be
'Cause one of these days I'll be
Born and Raised
And it's such a waste to grow up lonely
I still have dreams, they're not the same
They don't fly as high as they used to
I saw my friend, he's in my head and he said
"You don't remember me, do you?"
Then all at once it gets hard to take
It gets hard to fake what I won't be
'Cause one of these days I'll be
Born and Raised
And it's such a waste to grow up lonely
I still got time
I still got faith
I call on both of my brothers
I got a mom
I got a dad
But they do not have each other
So line on up, and take your place
And show your face to the morning
'Cause one of these days you'll be
Born and Raised
And it all comes on without warning
