<song artist="John_Mayer" title="Go_Anywhere">
Fold me up
Take me out
I'm portable
Fold me up
Take me out
I'm portable
I'm here on the road
I seem to have it all
We bolt it to the floor
Or we tape it to the wall
Fold it up
Fold it up
It's portable
Take me out
Fold me up
I'm portable
I put a map up on my ceiling
To fight that lonely feeling
In my bed
If you want to know what my life's about
Sometimes I'm here and I still freak out
It's just inside my head
The tape would not reveal a thing
Sometimes I'm looking around my back
To find the zipper and open it up and be twice my size
I want to find the highest peak
Stand up tall and with a shriek say "I'm alive" 
Cause I can go anywhere
I can go anywhere
I can go anywhere
I can go anywhere
I said "Pull the bus over John"
He said "Why, do you got to pee soon"
I said "I want to sleep outside underneath the half full moon at night"
Cause I can go anywhere
I can go anywhere
I sing my songs
Confident in the knowledge that you'll be here to sing along
Fold me up
Take me out
Boy you know I'm portable
