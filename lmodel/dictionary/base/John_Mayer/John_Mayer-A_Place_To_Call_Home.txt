<song artist="John_Mayer" title="A_Place_To_Call_Home">
I'm an architect
Of days that haven't happened yet
I can't believe a month is all it's been
You know my paper heart
The one I fill with pencil marks
I think I might have gone and bid you well
Little by little, inch by inch
We built a yard with a garden in the middle of it
It ain't much but it's a start
You got me swinging right along to the song in your heart
And a face to call home
A face to call home
You got a face to call home
So glad you didn't see 
The nervous wreck I used to be
Never thought a man could be so small
You never look at me
Like I'm a liability
I bet you never think I'd been at all
Little by little, inch by inch
We built a yard with a garden in the middle of it
And it ain't much, but it's a start
You got me swinging right along to the song in your heart
And a face to call home
A face to call home
You got a face to call home
A face to call home
A face to call home
You got a face to call home
Maybe I could stay a while, 
Maybe I could stay a while,
Maybe I could stay a while,
I'm talkin' like all of the time
Maybe I could stay a while,
Maybe I could stay a while,
Maybe I could stay a while,
I'm talkin' like all of the time
With a face to call home
A face to call home
You got a face to call home
