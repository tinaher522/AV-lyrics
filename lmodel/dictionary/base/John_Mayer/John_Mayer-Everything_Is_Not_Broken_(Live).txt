<song artist="John_Mayer" title="Everything_Is_Not_Broken_(Live)">
the autumn leaves so dry and sweet
tells me everything is not broken
no everything is not broken
if everything's not fine
if everything's not fine
that you could be 
all here with me
tells me everything is not broken
no everything is not broken
if everything's not fine
if everything's not fine
more wasted funerals in time, in time
if everything's not fine
if everything's not fine
cuz everything is not broken
no everything is not broken
everything will be fine
everything will be fine
will be fine (be fine)
will be fine
