<song artist="John_Mayer" title="Gravity">
Gravity
Is working against me
And gravity
Wants to bring me down
I'll never know what makes this man
With all the love that his heart can stand
Dream of ways to throw it all away
Gravity
Is working against me
And gravity
Wants to bring me down
Twice as much ain't twice as good
And can't sustain like one-half could
It's wanting more that's gonna send me to my knees
Gravity
Stay the hell away from me
Gravity
Has taken better men than me
Now how can that be?
Just keep me where the light is
Keep me where the light is
