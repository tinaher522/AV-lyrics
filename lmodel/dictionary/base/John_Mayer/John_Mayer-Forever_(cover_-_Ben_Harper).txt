<song artist="John_Mayer" title="Forever_(cover_-_Ben_Harper)">
Not talking about a year 
No not three of four 
I don't want that kind of forever 
In my life anymore 
Forever always seems to be around when it begins 
But forever never seems to be around when it ends 
So give me your forever 
Please your forever 
Not a day less will do 
From you 
People spend so much time 
Every single day 
Running around all over town 
Giving their forever away 
But no not me I won't let my forever roam 
And now I hope I can find my forever a home 
So give me your forever 
Please your forever 
Not a day less will do 
From you 
Like a handless clock with numbers 
An infinite of time 
No not the forever 
Found only in the mind 
Forever always seems to be around when things it begins 
But forever never seems to be around when things it end 
So give me your forever 
Please your forever 
Not a day less will do 
From you
