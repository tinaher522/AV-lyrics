<song artist="John_Mayer" title="Distance">
Distance is the reason she and me don't really talk no more 
It's written on my ticket information on the freezer door 
Me, I'm not sorry I got what came coming for me 
It's only everything I wanted all my life. 
Love was made to get us to stay in quite a closer region 
I wish my love could stay around a little more. 
Distance, Distance, Distance 
It's what it is, what it is now, now, now 
Distance makes a woman want to hear I love you more than once. 
If I could find a word that feels remotely like the feeling is. 
Me, I'm still lucky I will not succumb to all of this. 
It made temptation buy the women all my life. 
If love was me, you'd never stay in all the closest ranges. 
You'd never find a love that's closest all the time. 
Distance, Distance, Distance, Distance 
It's why I leave before I make myself say goodbye again 
Goodbye Goodbye again 
Distance makes a copy of my face she will bend inside her dreams. 
Blood on all these clothes is from the telephonic surgeries. 
Distance makes a man believe that loyalty is a thankless chore. 
Loyalty's the reason I leave semen on my hotel floor, yeah. 
Distance, Distance, Distance, yes 
It's what it is, it's what it is, now, now, now, now 
do do do do dah 
ahhhhhhhhhh 
ahhhhhhhhhh 
ahhhhhhhhhh 
ahhhhhhhhhh
