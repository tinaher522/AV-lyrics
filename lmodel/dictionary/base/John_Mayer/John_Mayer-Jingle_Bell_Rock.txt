<song artist="John_Mayer" title="Jingle_Bell_Rock">
Jingle bell 
Jingle bell 
Jingle bell rock
Jingle bells swing
and jingle bells ring
snowing and blowing up bushels of fun
now the jingle hop has begun
jingle bell
jingle bell
jingle bell rock
jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
dancing and prancing in jingle bell square
in the frosty air
what a bright time 
its the right time
to rock the night away
jingle bell time is a swell time
to go riding in a one horse sleigh
giddy up jingle horse
pick up your feet
jingle around the clock
mix and a mingle 
and a jingling beat
thats the jingle bell 
thats the jingle bell 
thats the jingle bell rock
