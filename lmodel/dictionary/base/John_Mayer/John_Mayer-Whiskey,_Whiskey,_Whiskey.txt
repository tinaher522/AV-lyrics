<song artist="John_Mayer" title="Whiskey,_Whiskey,_Whiskey">
Well we pick up in New York City
I'm trying to find the man I never got to be
But when I pushed down on the pavement
I found the whole thing so much harder than it seemed
The only deal I ever signed
No devil drew a dotted line
The stage was set, the words were mine
I'm not complaining
Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey
Water, water, water, sleep
Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey
Wake up, shake it off and repeat
It's just a phase
It's not forever
It's just a phase
But I still might have a ways to go
Every night around this town
My friends and I we treat it like a race
But when I really start to break it down
I wouldn't trust a girl who knew about this place
Walking home with no one left
Speak softly underneath my breath
Hey world, you ain't see nothing yet
Great, now it's waiting
Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey
Water, water, water, sleep
Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey
Wake up, shake it off and repeat
It's just a phase
It's not forever
It's just a phase
But I still might have a ways
Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey
Water, water, water, sleep
Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey
Wake up, shake it off and repeat and repeat
And repeat after me
Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey
Water, water, water, sleep
Dream somebody missed me
Wake up, shake it off and repeat
Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey
Wake me up and pour me in the street
