<song artist="John_Mayer" title="Everything_Is_Not_Broken">
That autumn leaves fall dry and sweet 
Tells me everything is not broken 
No everything is not broken 
If everything's not fine 
If everything's not fine 
That nature rains on flames we made 
Should tell you everything is not broken 
No everything is not broken 
If everything's not fine 
If everything's not fine 

And I will find the colors in my life 
The places and times it was now 
And I will walk outside on my own into the light 
The kind of clarity that only comes to me on Sunday's shine 
Sunday's shine 
It tells me everything is not broken 
No everything is not broken 
If everything is fine 
And everything is fine
