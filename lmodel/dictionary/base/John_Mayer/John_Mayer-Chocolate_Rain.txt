<song artist="John_Mayer" title="Chocolate_Rain">
Chocolate rain
Chocolates fallin?
On my window
In my car
Chocolate rain
From the sewers
To the plumming
In a jar
You don't know this rain fallin? down on me
Smell's a lil bit like poopey poopey
You don't know this chocolate rain down on me
Rain, rain, rain, rain, rain
Say it loud
Smell of kaka
Chocolate dookey
Chocolate rain
Coming down
Like a geyser
Chocolate something
On my brain
