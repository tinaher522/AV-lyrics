<song artist="John_Mayer" title="Kid_A">
I slip away,
I slipped on a little white lie.
We've got heads on sticks,
You've got ventriloquists.
We've got heads on sticks,
You've got ventriloquists.
Standing in the shadows,
At the end of my bed.
Standing in the shadows, 
At the end of my bed.
Standing in the shadows, 
At the end of my bed.
Standing in the shadows,
At the end of my bed
Rats and children,
Follow me out of town.
The rats and children,
Follow me out of their homes.
Come on kids.
