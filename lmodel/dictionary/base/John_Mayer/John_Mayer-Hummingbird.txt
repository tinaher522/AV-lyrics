<song artist="John_Mayer" title="Hummingbird">
Once upon most every morning 
I woke up to her flying there 
Hummingbird was making blows of 
Blowing rings of purple in the air 
All the while 
I was trying to keep her there 
Now I'm man enough to leave 
Man enough to always care 
Hummingbird 
Hummingbird 
That's all I heard 
That's my hummingbird 
Just because I said I didn't want her 
Doesn't mean I want her to go 
In fact, I quite depended on her 
But that I didn't want her to know 
Now that's she's gone I know 
All the while 
I was trying to keep her there, ya 
Now man enough to leave 
Man enough to always care 
Hummingbird 
Hummingbird 
That's all I heard 
That's my Hummingbird 
Hummingbird 
Hummingbird 
Is it too late 
Too late, hummingbird?
