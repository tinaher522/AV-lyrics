Dear Marie
Tell me what it was I used to be
Oh, dear Marie
Tell me what it was I used to be
And if you're further up the road
Can you show me what I still can't see?
Remember me?
I'm the boy you used to love when you were 15
Remember me?
I'm the boy you used to love when you were 15
Now I wonder what you think when you see me in a magazine
From time to time
I go looking for your photograph online
From time to time
I go looking for your photograph online
But some county judge in Ohio's all I ever find
Dear Marie
Tell me, do you still believe in me?
Oh, dear Marie
Tell me, do you still believe in me?
Well I got my dream, but you got a family
Yeah I got that dream, but you got yourself a family
Yeah I got that dream, but I guess it got away from me
