John Mayer &amp; Katy Perry
You love who you love
Who you love
You love who you love
Who you love
John Mayer
My girl she ain't the one that I saw coming
And sometimes I don't know which way to go
And I've tried to run before
But I'm not running anymore
'Cause I fought against it hard enough to know
John Mayer &amp; Katy Perry
That you love who you love
Who you love
You love who you love
Who you love
You love who you love
Who you love
John Mayer
Oh you can't make yourself stop dreaming
Who you're dreaming of
If it's who you love then it's who you love
Katy Perry
My boy he ain't the one that I saw coming
And some have said his heart's too hard to hold
And it takes a little time, but you should see him when he shines
'Cause you'd never want to let that feeling go
John Mayer &amp; Katy Perry
When you love who you love
Who you love
You love who you love
Who you love
Yeah, you love who you love
Who you love
John Mayer
Oh you can't make yourself stop dreaming
Who you're dreaming of
If it's who you love then it's who you love
John Mayer &amp; Katy Perry
Oh you love who you love
Who you love
You love who you love
Who you love
You love who you love
Who you love
John Mayer &amp; Katy Perry
Oh you can't make yourself stop dreaming
Who you're dreaming of
If it's who you love then it's who you love
Katy Perry
It's who you love
Who you love
Who you love
Who you love
You're the one I love
