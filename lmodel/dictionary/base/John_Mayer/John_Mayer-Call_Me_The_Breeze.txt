<song artist="John_Mayer" title="Call_Me_The_Breeze">
They call me the breeze
I keep blowing down the road
They call me the breeze
I keep blowing down the road
I ain't got me nobody
I don't carry me no load
Ain't no change in the weather
Ain't no change in me
There ain't no change in the weather
Ain't no change in me
I'm not hiding from nobody
Nobody's hiding from me
I got that green light, babe
I got to keep moving on
I got that green light, babe
I got to keep moving on
I might go to California
I might go down to Georgia
I don't know
