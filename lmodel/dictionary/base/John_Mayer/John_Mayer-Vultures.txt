<song artist="John_Mayer" title="Vultures">
Some of us
We're hardly ever here
The rest of us were born to disappear
How do I stop myself from being just a number?
How will I hold my head to keep from going under?
Down to the wire
I wanted water but I'll walk through the fire
If this is what it takes to take me even higher
Then I'll come through like I do
When the world keeps testing me, testing me, testing me
How did they find me here?
What do they want from me?
All of these vultures hiding right outside my door
I hear them whispering
They're trying to ride it out
They've never gone this long without a kill before
Down to the wire
I wanted water but I'll walk through the fire
If this is what it takes to take me even higher
Then I'll come through like I do
When the world keeps testing me, testing me, testing me
Wheels up
I've got to leave this evening
I can't seem to shake these vultures off of my trail
Power is made by power being taken
So I keep on running to protect my situation
Down to the wire
I wanted water but I'll walk through the fire
If this is what it takes to take me even higher
Then I'll come through like I do
When the world keeps testing me, testing me, testing me
