<song artist="John_Mayer" title="Great_Indoors">
Check your pulse It's proof
That you're not listening to
The call your life's been issuing you
The rhythm of a line of idle days
Scared of a world outside
You should go explore
Pull all the shades and
Wander the great indoors
The great indoors
Lamplight makes the shadows play
And posters take the walls away
The T.V. is your window pane
The view won't let you down
So put your faith in a late night show
I bet you didn't even know
Depends on how far out you go
The channel numbers change
Scared of a world outside
You should go explore
Pull all the shades and
Wander the great indoors
Though lately I can't blame you
I have seen the world
And sometimes wish your room
Had room for two
So go unlock the door
And find what you are here for
Leave the great indoors
Leave the great indoors
Check your pulse it's proof
That you're not listening to
The call your life's been issuing you
The rhythm of a line of idle days
Of idle days
