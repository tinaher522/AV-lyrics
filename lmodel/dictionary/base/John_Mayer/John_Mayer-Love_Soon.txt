<song artist="John_Mayer" title="Love_Soon">
I know you've been sworn 
I read your complaint 
You're needing someone older 
And though I've been warned to live day by day 
There's something taking over 
Did you expect to kiss me one time 
While looking at me with the same eyes ever again? 
So come on and face it 
So come on and face it 
It's time that we say it 
You can cross the line whenever you want to 
I'm calling it love soon 
Close your mind and waste some time if you have to 
I'm calling it love soon 
It's not about you now 
It's what we are 
Your mother complains that you need a man 
You haven't mentioned me yet 
And all of your friends don't know who I am 
I've been your best kept secret 
I understand I wasn't part of the plan 
A dollar short, a minute early 
But I am your man 
So come on and face it 
So come on and face it 
It's time that we say it 
You can cross the line whenever you want to 
I'm calling it love soon 
Close your mind and waste some time if you have to 
I'm calling it love soon 
It's not about you now 
It's what we are 
Let's bypass the bullshit and move on because 
The minute hand moves faster than you think it does 
And by no fault of yours and by no fault of mine 
The bottom line is laying in the bed that we've been playing in tonight 
Im calling it love soon 
Im calling it love soon 
You can cross the line whenever you want to 
I'm calling it love soon 
Close your mind and waste some time if you have to 
I'm calling it love soon 
It's not about you now 
It's what we are
