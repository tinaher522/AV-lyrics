<song artist="John_Mayer" title="Same_Time_Last_Year">
you know those days before i met you 
well good cause i don't either
it's almost like they were meant to
make the whole thing sweeter
You think i'm just a boy who's
consumed by all his fears
the fact that you should have seen me
same time last year
same time last year
oh the same time last year
living fifteen over
shortly over the nick of time 
i'm sad like a boy
but I smile like a man
its the best way that I never understand
I wish I would have made it
I hate the view from here
I didn't think I saw my wife that summer 
that same time last year
oh the same time last year
oh the same time last year
oh the same time last year
