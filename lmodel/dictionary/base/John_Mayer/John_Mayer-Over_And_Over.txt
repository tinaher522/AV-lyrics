Over and Over   -- John Mayer
Baby, you could jump a hundred times
There's just no way that you'll ever fall out of my graces, out of my graces
Let's say for a second that you ever do
And it gets hard to look at you
Time will erase it, time will erase it
You can use me up, kick me down
As much as you like, we're good on time
Cause, guess who desperately wants you, over and over	
Over and over
Guess who desperately wants you, over and over
Over and over
You can cut your hair just to grow it back
Or dye it till the sink turns black
I'll recognize you, I'll recognize you
When you lose your way and I'm doing fine
I'll even lose my place in line
I'll help you find it, I'll help you find it
Cause, guess who desperately wants you, over and over
Over and over
Guess who desperately wants you, over and over
Over and over 
Fadeout
Cry at the hands of you before I laughed at something new
Cause over and over, I'm breaking my heart just to save your own
