<song artist="John_Mayer" title="Outside_In_The_Underground">
violent skies
10 am
falling on my knees again
outside in the underground
proud in the rain
I'm walking a straight line
stepped on all of the cracks this time
I don't care I'm not moving aside
for anyone
outside in the underground
proud in the rain
outside in the underground
there's no way out of here today
I raise my head up to the sky again
and make my way alone
I'm never home
but I've stopped searching
cause the city told me so
it all comes down
down to me
oh I've got a hundred lives
oh I've got to get it right
oh who knows someday I might
outside in the underground
underground
proud in the rain
outside in the underground
there's no way out of here today
I raise my head up to the sky again
and make my way alone
I'm never home but I stopped searching
cause the city told me so
it all comes down
down to me
oh I've got a hundred lives
oh I got to get it right
oh who knows someday I might
oh I've got to get it right
