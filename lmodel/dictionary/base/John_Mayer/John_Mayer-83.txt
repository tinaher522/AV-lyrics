<song artist="John_Mayer" title="83">
I've these dreams I'm walking home
Home when it used to be
And everything is as it was
Frozen in front of me
Here I stand 6 feet small
Romanticizing years ago
It's a bitter sweet feeling hearing
"Wrapped Around Your Finger" on the radio
And these days I wish I was 6 again
Oh make me a red cape
I wanna be Superman
Oh, if only my life was more like 1983
All these things would be more like they
Were at the start of me
Had it made in 83
Thinking bout my brother Ben
I miss him every day
He looks just like his brother John
But on an 18 month delay
Here I stand 6 feet small
And smiling cause I'm scared as hell
Kind of like my life is like a sequel to a movie
Where the actor's names have changed
Oh well
Well these days
I wish I was 6 again
Oh make me a red cape
I wanna be Superman
Oh, if only my life was more like 1983
All these things would be
more like they were at the start of me
If my life was more like 1983
I'd plot a course to the source of the
Purest little part of me
And most my memories
Have escaped me
Or confused themselves with dreams
If heaven's all they want it to be
Send your prayers to me care of 1983
You can paint that house a rainbow of colors
Rip out the floorboards
Replace the shutters but that's my plastic in the dirt
Whatever happened to my whatever happened to my
Whatever happened to my lunchbox
When came the day that it got
Thrown away and don't you think I should
Have had some say in that decision
If only my life
If only my life...
