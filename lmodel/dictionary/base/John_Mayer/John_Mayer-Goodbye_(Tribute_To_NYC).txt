<song artist="John_Mayer" title="Goodbye_(Tribute_To_NYC)">
He Leaves home just like every morning
Saying goodbye to his son
A kiss on the cheek to the woman he loves
And its off to work for another day
Traffic jam outside the city
Leaves him anxious once again
He parks his car and rushes up the stairs
Puts his breifcase down and sits in his chair
Overlooking the town he calls home
And everyone is unaware
Then up from the frame of the picture on his desk
Of the family he loves
Uneasiness fills his chest
So he calls his wife just to tell her this:
Don't wait up for me tonight
Cuz I won't be coming home
And everything's gonna be alright
I just wanted you to know
I had to call you one last time
Just to rest your mind
Don't wait up for me tonight
Cuz I won't be coming home
And everything's gonna be alright
I just wanted you to know
Lights go out
People shout
People crying
Me, I'm trying
Mothers cry 
Fathers die
And me, I'm still holding on
To you
To you
Lights go out
People shout
People crying
Me, I'm trying
Mothers cry 
Fathers die
And me, I'm still holding on
To you
A few more words and I'm going to go
I can see the end from here
I love you I just wanted to say
Those three words to you today
