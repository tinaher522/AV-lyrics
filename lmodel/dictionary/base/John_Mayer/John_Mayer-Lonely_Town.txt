<song artist="John_Mayer" title="Lonely_Town">
"The best thing about being on the road is that now I can write my big road opus. 
I can write my big song about being on the road, which I couldnt do. 
Cuz every artist has to have that sort of like..."
I strolled into town on a Friday night
Another lonely town
Did I mention that it's a brand new town on this Friday night?
It's the town that I'm referring to
When I refer to this town
The coffee's stale
And the cigarettes have...tobacco in them
And...lightening. . .
