<song artist="John_Mayer" title="A_Break_In_The_Clouds">
[Verse:]
I met a man I didn't know that asked me how are you doing
Shoulda just said fine cause it's all he wanted to hear
But for reasons unknown in a sorrowful tone I said
Man it's been a hell of a year
And I don't really know where I'm going
And I might just be hanging around
[Chorus:]
And I don't really know where I'm going
And I might just be hanging around
If life's shades of gray
Then I guess you could say
That I've been waiting for a break in the clouds
[Verse:]
I went to go see some gypsy to tell me my future
But she asked for my photograph instead
As I walked through the cold with my fortune untold I said
Good luck trying to reach me when I'm dead
[Chorus:]
Cause I don't really know where I'm going
And I might just be hanging around
If life's shades of gray
Then I guess you could say
That I've been waiting on a break in the clouds
That I've been waiting for a break in the clouds
[Verse:]
I saw the love I used to know swallow me whole
On a day I was out of clean clothes
She sized me up and she said honey how is your head
I said you can't call me honey but honey heaven only knows
[Chorus:]
And I don't really know where I'm going
And I might just be hanging around
If life's shades of gray
Then I guess you could say
That I've been waiting for a break in the clouds
[Chorus/Outro:]
Bet your gonna be findin' a break in the clouds
No, no, no I don't know where I'm going
And I might might might just be hanging around
And if life shades of gray
Then I guess you could say
That I've been waiting for a break in the clouds
