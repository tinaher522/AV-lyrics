<song artist="John_Mayer" title="Lifelines">
i saw you sleeping on the couch tonight
you know it serves you right
makes you luckier than i
all the colors in the room have changed
appear to disagree 
but brother ive discovered you
we're pushin on
we're passin through
and it won't be long
till i walk with you
but tonight im down
but im inside out
staring at the pictures in the album you forgot about
but isn't it a shame
the times have changed
but isnt it strange 
lifelines stay the same
the same
we're never where we wanna be
that's ok with me
it's just the way it is it seems
it feels like make believe
but you're my history
but brother i've rediscovered you and
we're pushing on
we're passing through
and it wont be long
till i walk with you
but tonight im down
im inside out 
staring at the pictures in the album you forgot about
but isnt it a shame
the times have changed
but isnt it strange
lifelines stay the same
round and round
cant believe my heart has waited this long
all along
we've been children in a cold world where 
wonder was lost every day
and if love was a compass
oh i have lost my way
