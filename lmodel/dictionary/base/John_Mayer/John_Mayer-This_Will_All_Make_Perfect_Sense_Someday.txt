<song artist="John_Mayer" title="This_Will_All_Make_Perfect_Sense_Someday">
This will all make perfect sense someday
I'll be a-okay
All my bills have all gone pink
I shit the bed
I broke the bed
This coulda been a slow song
A laundry list of all the wrongs
But end of the day
This is my beautiful disaster-piece I've made
and it goes and I quote "it will never be like this" 
This will all make perfect sense someday
I'll be A-Okay
This will all make perfect sense someday
There's got to be a reason for the rain
I don't understand the numbers
But my faith is in the math
That the odds are all this pain will leave and I will live and
And we'll look back and laugh
And to all the hearts I've broken
And the ones that once broke mine
I've got suspicions, all will be forgiven in time
All you gotta do is call them up and say that now
This will all make perfect sense someday
I'll be A-Okay
This will all make perfect sense someday
There's got to be a reason for the rain
And if it ever gets bad 
I mean really bad
I'll move to Nova Scotia
Forget the life I had
I'll be up at 9 each morning
Down by the shore
Collecting things that fell off boats in storms
Well ok so I might never
But it's nice to know the option's there
This will all make perfect sense someday
I'll be A-Okay
This will all make perfect sense someday
There's got to be a reason for the rain
a reason for the rain (x3)
And it doesn't help
That I keep biting my lip in the same place
