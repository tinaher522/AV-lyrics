<song artist="John_Mayer" title="I'm_Gonna_Find_Another_You">
It's really over
You made your stand
You got me crying
As was your plan
But when my loneliness is through
I'm gonna find another you
You take your sweaters
You take your time
You might have your reasons
But you will never have my rhyme
I'm gonna sing my way away from blue
I'm gonna find another you
When I was your lover
No one else would do
If I'm forced to find another
I hope she looks like you
And she's nicer, too
So go on, baby
Make your little getaway
My pride will keep me company
And just gave yours all away
Now I'm gonna dress myself for two
Once for me, and once for someone new
I'm gonna do some things you wouldn't let me do
I'm gonna find another you
