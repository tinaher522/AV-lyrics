<song artist="John_Mayer" title="Area_Codes_(cover_-_Ludacris)">
hoes, i got hoes
in different area codes
hoes .. hoes ..
in different area codes
i got hoes (hoes, hoes, hoes)
in different area codes
i got hoes
in different area codes
hold i think i got the lyrics wrong
i got the lyrics wong
im sorry
thats not me, thats not me
thats not my style
ya know - im siginng a song that has nothing to do with me
im no dog, ya know, im no dog 
im a sensitive man, im a sensitive man
so, we'll change it up .. watch

in different area codes

in different area codes
yeah yeah yeah ..
