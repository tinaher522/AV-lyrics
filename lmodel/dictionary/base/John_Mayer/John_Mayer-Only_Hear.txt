<song artist="John_Mayer" title="Only_Hear">
Do not waste this evening, baby I'm begging you
Your big imagination's playing its tricks on you
You think my belief is something I'm gonna do
Feel my chest when I look at you
Baby you, you've got my only heart
Yeah, you've got my only heart
Yeah, you've got my only, only heart
So hard to be so far out living our separate lives
Your phone must've really broken, I tried your number twice
And if you need confirmation, baby I understand
It's alright if you want me to tell you
You, you've got my only heart
Yeah, you've got my only heart
Yeah, you've got my only, only heart
And you love like your hand's on the horn, baby
I adore you but, there's a hole in the cup
That should hold my love, hold my love
If you let, if you let, if you let me leave, I swear, I never will
Oh, remember now
You, you've got my only heart
Yeah, you've got my only heart
Yeah, you've got my only heart
Yeah, you've got my only heart
Yeah, you've got my only heart
