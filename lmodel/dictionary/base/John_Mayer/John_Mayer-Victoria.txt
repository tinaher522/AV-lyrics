<song artist="John_Mayer" title="Victoria">
Don't know why Tori came by
But I could see by the look in her eyes
Tory'd been driving 'round the town for a while
Playing with the thought of leaving
Don't know why, but Tori just smiled
And mentioned something about how you were right
Must have been hard to see through the tears she was hiding
She said "I might not be seeing him soon"
"I've got a few things I've been waiting to do"
Hey, Tori came by
Tori came by tonight
Hey, Tori came by
She says to say goodbye
Looked outside at the car in the drive
And the suitcase on the back seat inside
Sure it's so she can't look out behind at the road
She said "I might not be seeing him soon"
"I've got a few things I've been waiting to do"
Hey, Tori came by
Tori came by tonight
Hey, Tori came by
She says to say goodbye
Don't look down, she seemed alright
You might be asking where is Tori tonight?
Somewhere out on the highway I'm sure she's fine
