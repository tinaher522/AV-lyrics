<song artist="John_Mayer" title="Something's_Missing">
I'm not alone
I wish I was
Cause then I'd know I was down because
I couldn't find a friend around
To love me like they do right now
They do right now
I'm dizzy from the shopping mall
I searched for joy but I bought it all
It doesn't help the hunger pain
And a thirst I'd have to drown first to ever satiate
Something's missing
And I don't know how to fix it
Something's missing
And I don't know what it is
At all
When autumn comes
It doesn't ask
It just walks in where it left you last
You never know when it starts
Until there's fog inside the glass around your summer heart
Something's missing
And I don't know how to fix it
Something's missing
And I don't know what it is
At all
I can't be sure that this state of mine
Is not of my own design
I wish there was an over-the-counter test
For loneliness like this
Something's missing
And I don't know how to fix it
Something's missing
And I don't know what it is
No I don't know what it is
Something's different
And I don't know what it is
No I don't know what it is
Friends

A well slept opposite sex

Messages waiting on me when
I come home
