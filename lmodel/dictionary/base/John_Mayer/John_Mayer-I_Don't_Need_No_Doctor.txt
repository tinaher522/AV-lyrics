<song artist="John_Mayer" title="I_Don't_Need_No_Doctor">
&lt;!I don't need no doctor
'Cause I know whats ailing me
I don't need no doctor
'Cause I know whats ailing me
I've been too long away from my baby, yeah
I'm coming down with a misery
I don't need no doctor
for my prescription to be filled
(Don't need no doctor)
I don't need no doctor, tell you now
for my prescription to be filled
(I don't need no doctor)
(Don't need no doctor)
Only my baby's arms could ever
Could ever take away this chill
(I don't need no doctor)
(Don't need no doctor)
Now the doctor say I need rest
Before I need her tenderness
Put me on the critical list
When all I need is her sweet kiss
Gave me a medicated lotion
But it didn't soothe my emotion
I don't need no doctor
For my hope to live is gone
I don't need no doctor, no no
For my hope to live is gone
(I don't need no doctor)
(Don't need no doctor)
All I need is my baby, please
Won't you please just come on home.&gt;
