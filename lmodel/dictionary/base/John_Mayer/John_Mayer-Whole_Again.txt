<song artist="John_Mayer" title="Whole_Again">
Don't wanna be so angry 
Don't wanna keep so quiet 
Now its open fire and i can warm 
Don't wanna be so careful 
Don't care enought to mind oh no 
Leave me with no hear room 
To climb back down 
I'll just wait for a land slide 
I've made up my mind 
To make me whole again 
I take up your time 
When I'm alone 
Don't wanna be so anxious 
Don't care to stand in line 
I lie in an open fire 
As you watch me burn down 
And wait along the way side 
I've made up my mind 
To make me whole again 
I take up your time 
When I'm alone 
I don't wanna let you down 
i don't care to bring this up again 
In my defense 
It doesnt make sense 
Why you even come around 
weve been over and over 
you lay around 
and watch me go back out 
before the storm 
made up my mind to make me whole again 
i take up your time 
i am 
to make me whole again 
i take up your time 
when im alone
