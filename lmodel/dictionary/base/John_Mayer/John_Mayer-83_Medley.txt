And these days
And these days
I wish, I wish, I wish I was six again
I wish, I wish, I wish, I wish, I wish, I wish 
I wish, I wish, I wish I was six again
If only my...
I've these dreams of
Walking home
Home where it used to be
Everything is as it was
Frozen in front of me
Here I stand, six feet small
Romanticizing years ago
It's a bittersweet feeling hearing No Such Thing on the radio
And these days
I wish I was six again
Oh, make me a red cape
I wanna be Superman
Oh, if only my life was more like 1983
All these things would be more like they were at the start of me
Had it made in '83
Thinking 'bout my brother Ben
I miss him every day
He looks just like his brother John
But on an 18-month delay
He's a-okay, by the way
Here I stand, six feet small
And smiling 'cause I'm scared as hell
Kind of like life is like a sequel to a movie
Where the actors' names have changed
Oh well
Well, these days
I wish I was six again
Oh, make me a red cape
I wanna be Superman
Oh, if only my life was more like 1983
I wish things would be more like they were at the start of me
If my life was more like 1983
Plot a course to the source of the purest little part of me
And most my memories
Have escaped me or confused themselves with dreams
If heaven's all we want it to be
Send your prayers to me
Care of Bridgeport, CT, and 1983
You can paint that house a rainbow of colors
Rip out the floorboards, replace the shutters
But that's my plastic in the dirt
Whatever happened to my, whatever happened to my
Whatever happened to my lunchbox?
When came the day that it got thrown away
And don't you think I should have had some say in that decision?
The phone rings in the middle of the night
My father says, What you gonna do with your life?
Oh Daddy dear, you know, you're still number one
But girls, they wanna have fun
Oh girls just wanna have, oh no, no, no, no
They just wanna, they just wanna
They just wanna, they just wanna
They just wanna, girls, let's hear it for the boys
Let's hear it for my baby
Let's hear it for the boys
Oh, let's give the boy a hand
Oh, oh, maybe he's no Romeo
But he's my loving, one-man show
Oh, oh, oh, oh
If only my life
Ba, ba-da, ba, ba-da
If only my life
Ba, ba-da, ba, ba-da
If only my life
Ba, ba-da, ba, ba-da
If my life was more like '83
