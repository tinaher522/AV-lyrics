<song artist="John_Mayer" title="Standard_Lines_(with_Dashboard_Confessional)">
Which of the bold faced lies will we use?
I hope that you're happy,
you really deserve it,
this will be the best for us both in the end. 
But your taste still lingers on my lips 
like I just placed them upon yours
and I starve 
I starve for you.
But this new diet's liquid
and dulling to the senses.
And it's crude
but it will do.
Which of the standard lines will we use?
I've been meaning to call you. 
I've just been so busy.
We'll catch up soon.
Let's make it a point to.
But your taste still lingers on my lips 
like I just placed them upon yours
and I starve 
I starve for you.
But this new diet's liquid
and dulling to the senses.
And it's crude
but it will do.
it will do.
I hope it will do.
