<song artist="John_Mayer" title="Badge_And_Gun">
Give me my badge and gun
Give me the road that I may run
Give me that peaceful wandering free I used to know
I've waited all I can
But I'm just not a patient man
Man, I've been hiding here for seven months or so
Hand me down my coat and hat
And grab the winter one at that
You'll never know how long I'll be away
Give me my badge and gun
Give me the songs that I once sung
Give me those jet black, kick-back, lay-down nights alone
This house is safe and warm
But I was made to chase the storm
Taking the whole world on with big ol' empty arms
Tell my friends I tried my best
That one day I just up and left
They probably saw it coming anyway
Hey, hey
The lock is on the cellar door
I can't remember what it's for
I ain't been down those stairs in oh so long
So so long
Give me my badge and gun
Give me the road that I must run
Give me that peaceful wandering free I used to know
The copy of your key
Is hanging where it used to be
Good as you've always been to me
The life I need to lead
Is somewhere out there calling over those hills
