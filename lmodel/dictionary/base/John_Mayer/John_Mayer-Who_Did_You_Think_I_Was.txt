<song artist="John_Mayer" title="Who_Did_You_Think_I_Was">
I got half a smile and zero shame
I got a reflection with a different name
Got a brand new blues I can't explain
Who did you think I was
Every mornin' when the day begins
I make up my mind but change it back again
I'm a shifter of the shape I'm in
Who did you think I was
You got my number but I always knew the score
Who did you think I was
Am I the one who plays the quiet songs
Is He the one who turns the ladies on
Will I keep shinin til my light is gone
Who did you think I was
You got my number but I always knew the score
Who did you think I was
Here is a line that you won't understand
I'm half of the boy but twice the man
Carry the weight of the world in the palm of my hand
Who did you think I was
