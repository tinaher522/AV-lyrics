<song artist="John_Mayer" title="Waitin'_On_The_Day">
Waitin' on the day
When my thoughts are my own
When this house is my home
And plans are laid
When you'll be there for me baby
When you'll love me all the way
When you take my side in every little firefight
When you hang your things and stay
I'm waitin' on the day
When my life on the run
Bleaches out in the sun and
Shows my age
I'm waitin' on the day
When that voice comes to say
That it's not wrong what you did
For just a kid
When you'll be there for me baby
When you'll love me all the way
When you take my side in every little firefight
When you hang your things and stay
I'm waitin' on the day
Waitin' on the day
When these words are in stone
When the kids are all grown
And we go dancing
Oh can you do it baby?
Can you love me all the way?
Will you tie me tight in little strands of paradise?
Will you walk with me before the morning fades?
I'm waitin' on the day
