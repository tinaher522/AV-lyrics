<song artist="John_Mayer" title="Simmering_Medley">
Is there any way to 
Know when it's over? 
When will you show her 
When you'll be done 
Is there any day that 
Slowly rolls over 
That you will know where 
The last wall was 
Oooohhh 
How will you ever know 
How will you know 
How will you ever know 
When you're 
Sleeping at the crash site 
Walking on the wreckage of 
Somebody's past life 
Another one's old love 
Where the fire burned the grass began to grow 
Nobody walks there 
Everbody knows that 
Ooooh oooh oooh 
How will you know 
Singing oooohhhhhh 
How will you know 
How will you know 
You've been... 
Is there any one who 
Pulled it off easy 
Spoke what they were thinking and 
Moved onto the next city and 
Is there anyone who 
Let them down gently and 
Moved onto the next night on 
I don't know that 
Oooh oooh oooh ooh 
How will you know 
Oooh oooh ooh ooh 
How will you know 
That you've been 
Sleeping at the crash site 
Resting on the wreckage of 
Somebody's past life 
Somebody's old love 
Sleeping at the crash site 
Resting on the wreckage of 
Somebody's old love 
Somebody's old love 
People have the right to fly and 
Will when it gets compromised 
Airports see it all the time 
I was gonna play Wheel now I changed my mind 
Sleeping at the crash site 
Sleeping at the crash site 
Sleeping at the crash site 
Resting on the wreckage of 
So much old love 
So much old love 
I can feel your body 
When I'm lying in my bed 
There's too much confusion 
Running round through 
Running round through
