<song artist="John_Mayer" title="Something_Like_Olivia">
Well Olivia is taken
But a look like hers can be found from time to time
Yeah Olivia is taken
But a look like hers can be found from time to time
I'm thinking something like Olivia is
What I need to find
There's only one man in this world who gets to
Sleep with her by his side
There's only one man in this world who gets to
Sleep with her by his side
I'm thinking something like Olivia could
Keep me through the night
Now I'm not trying to steal
No love away from no one man
No, I'm not trying to steal
No love away from no one man
But if Olivia herself were at my door
I'd have to say I'd let her in
Something like Olivia
Something like Olivia
Something like Olivia
Something like Olivia
I keep thinking something like Olivia is
What I need to find
