<song artist="John_Mayer" title="Can't_Take_That_Plane">
Bought a ticket for a trip I wanted long ago
Staring deep into crying eyes
Said goodbye, stood in line, now I changed my mind
I used to run and never look behind
But now, now I've got a love to leave
And now, not gonna walk away so easily
I can't take that plane, I can't take that
I can't take that plane today
I can't take that plane, I can't take that plane
Plane lands short a man on the other side
Driver stands with a sign in faith
Checks his watch as he size up the time gone by
Two lonely pieces circle baggage claim
But yeah, now I've got a love to leave
And yeah, don't you know it changes
Everything, everything
I can't take that plane, I can't take that
I can't take that plane today
I can't take that plane, I can't take that plane
No, I can't, I can't
I can't, I can't
I'm coming to getcha, I'm coming to getcha now
I'm coming to getcha, I'm coming to getcha now
