<song artist="John_Mayer" title="How_Much_It_Hurts">
Speak, speak your mind
Your always telling me I need to open mine
And wait, wait your turn
Then shut me out cause you've got  nothing left to learn
Oh, you say there's nothing wrong with being proud
So tell me what you love and say it loud
Now here's the dose that you've been dishing out
If you're listening this is how much it hurts
If you're listening this is how much it hurts
Oh, I'm wrong
I'm wrong again
But not because of where I stand but where I've been
And it burns
Oh, you know it burns like hell

To know there's nothing I can do but wish you well
You say there's nothing wrong with being proud
So tell me what you love and say it loud
I've been good enough to stay and hear you out
But you're wrong
You're never wrong
Oh, you say there's nothing wrong with being proud
Ya, so tell me what you love and say it loud
I've been giving you the benefit of the doubt
If you're listening this is how much it hurts
If you're listening this is how much it hurts
If you're listening this is how much it hurts
If you're listening this is how much it hurts
