<song artist="John_Mayer" title="Old_Love">
I can feel your body
When I'm lying in my bed
There's too much confusion
Running round through my head
It's making me so angry
To know that the flame will always burn
When will I get over?
When will I ever learn? (ever learn)
Old love
Leave me alone
Old love
Go on home
I can see your face
But I know that it's not real
Just an illusion
Caused by how I used to feel
And it's making me so angry
No, no, no- the flame will always burn
Come on, when will I get over?
Come on, when will I ever learn?
Old love
Leave me alone
Old love
Go on, go on home
(guitar)
Old love
Old love...
Old love
