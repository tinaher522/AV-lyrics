<song artist="John_Mayer" title="Dreaming_With_A_Broken_Heart">
When you're dreaming with a broken heart 
The waking up is the hardest part
You roll out of bed and down on your knees
And for the moment you can hardly breathe
Wondering
Was she really here?
Is she standing in my room?
No she's not
'Cause she's gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
When you're dreaming with a broken heart
The giving up is the hardest part
She takes you in with her crying eyes
Then all at once, you have to say goodbye
Wondering
Could you stay, my love?
And will you wake up by my side?
No she can't
'Cause she's gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
Now do I have to fall asleep with roses in my hand?
Do I have to fall asleep with roses in my hand?
Do I have to fall asleep with roses in my hand?
And would you get them if I did?
No you won't
'Cause you're gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
When you're dreaming with a broken heart
The waking up is the hardest part
