<song artist="John_Mayer" title="Quiet">
midnight
lock all the doors
and turn out the lights
feels like the end of the world
this Sunday night
there's not a sound
outside the snow's coming down
and somehow I can't seem to find
the quiet inside my mind
3:02
the space in this room
has turned on me
and all my fears have cornered me here
me and my TV screen
the volume's down
blue lights are dancing around
and still, I can't seem to find
the quiet inside my mind
daylight is climbing the walls
cars start and feet walk the halls
the world awakes and now I am safe
at least by the light of day
