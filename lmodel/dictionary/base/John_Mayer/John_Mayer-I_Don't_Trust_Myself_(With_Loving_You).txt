<song artist="John_Mayer" title="I_Don't_Trust_Myself_(With_Loving_You)">
No, I'm not the man I used to be lately
See, you met me at an interesting time
And if my past is any sign of your future
You should be warned before I let you inside
Hold on to whatever you find, baby
Hold on to whatever will get you through
Hold on to whatever you find, baby
I don't trust myself with loving you
I will beg my way into your garden
And then I'll break my way out when it rains
Just to get back to the place where I started
So I can want you back all over again
(I don't really understand)
Hold on to whatever you find, baby
Hold on to whatever will get you through
Hold on to whatever you find, baby
I don't trust myself with loving you
Who do you love?
Girl I see through your love
Who do you love?
Me or the thought of me?
Hold on to whatever you find, baby
Hold on to whatever will get you through
Hold on to whatever you find, baby
I don't trust myself with loving you
