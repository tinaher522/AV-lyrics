<song artist="John_Mayer" title="In_Your_Atmosphere">
I don't think I'm gonna go to LA anymore
I don't think I'm gonna go to LA anymore
I don't know what it's like to blame you
Nothing's true 
I don't think I'm gonna go to LA anymore
I don't think I'm gonna go to LA anymore
I'm not sure that I really ever could
Hold on to a hotel key in a
Bedroom neighborhood
and go sleep-walking in Hollywood
I'm gonna steer clear
Burn up in your atmosphere
I'm gonna steer clear
Cus I'd die if I saw you
I'd die if I didn't see you there
So I don't think I'm gonna go to LA anymore
Cus I miss you
It sucks that I'm not mad
I dont think I'm gonna go to LA anymore
I get lost on the boulevard at night
Without your voice to tell me I love you, take a right
the ten and the two is a lonely sight
I'm gonna steer clear
Burn up in your atmosphere
I'm gonna steer clear
Cus I'd die if I saw you
I'd die if I didn't see you
I'm gonna steer clear
Burn up in your atmosphere here
I'm gonna steer clear
Cus I'd die if I saw you
I'd die if I didn't see you there
see you there
I think I'm gonna stay gonna stay gonna stay in the gray gonna stay
All the street lights say nevermind nevermind
All the canyon lines say nevermind
Sunset says we see it all the time, nevermind, nevermind.

Wherever I go, whatever I do
I wonder where I am in my relationship to you
Wherever you go, wherever you are
I watch your life play out in pictures from afar
Wherever I go, whatever I do
I wonder where I am in my relationship to you
Wherever you go, wherever you are
I watch that pretty life play out in pictures from afar
