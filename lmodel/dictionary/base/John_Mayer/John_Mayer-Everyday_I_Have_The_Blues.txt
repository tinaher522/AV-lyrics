<song artist="John_Mayer" title="Everyday_I_Have_The_Blues">
Every day
Every day I have the blues
Every day
Every day I have the blues
When you see me worried baby
Because
It's you I hate to lose
Oh, nobody loves me
Nobody seems to care
Yes, nobody loves me
Nobody seems to care
Speaking of bad luck
And trouble
Well you know
I had my share
I'm gonna pack my suitcase
Move on down the line
Yes
I'm gonna pack my suitcase
Move on down the line
Where there
Ain't nobody worried
And there
Ain't nobody crying
