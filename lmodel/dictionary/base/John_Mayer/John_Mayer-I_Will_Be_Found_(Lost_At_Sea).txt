<song artist="John_Mayer" title="I_Will_Be_Found_(Lost_At_Sea)">
It doesn't matter where you roam
When no one's left to call you home
I might have strayed a bit too far
I'm countin' all the moon-lit stars
I'm a little lost at sea
I'm a little birdie in a big ol' tree
Ain't nobody looking for me
Here out on the highway
But I will be found
I will be found
When my time comes down
I will be found
Somedays I think it's all okay
Some nights I throw it all away
I saw a face and I could tell
My ghost had left her town as well
I'm a little lost at sea
I'm a little birdie in a big ol' tree
Ain't nobody looking for me
Here out on the highway
But I will be found
I will be found
When my time comes down
I will be found
I'm a little lost at sea
I'm a little birdie in a big ol' tree
Ain't nobody looking for me
Here out on the highway
Maybe I'm a runaway train
Maybe I'm a feather in a hurricane
Maybe it's a long play game, but maybe that's a good thing
'Cause I will be found
I will be found
When my time comes down
I will be found
So I keep running 'til my run is gone
Keep on riding 'til I see that dawn
And I will be found
I will be found
