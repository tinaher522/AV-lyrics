<song artist="John_Mayer" title="Go_Easy_On_Me">
Go easy on me for the night has been long
I'm not quite as strong as you see me
I came here alone and I'll leave on my own
The next stop is home so go easy on me
Oh, I don't need your truth
Or a good talking-to from your mountain
No, I don't know your name and I won't take the blame
Don't know what you need, so go easy on me
Go easy on me, for I mean you no harm
It's possible charm is in order
But you make it so hard when you throw up your guard
I'm not here to spar so go easy on me
Oh, the clanging of swords
And the war of the words doesn't move me
See, my heart barely works and it's covered in dirt,
It still kind of hurts, so go easy on me
Oh, I see in your eyes, you don't realize what you're doing
So, here's some advice, never hurts to be nice
If you're not gonna be, then go easy on me
Go easy on me, go easy on me
