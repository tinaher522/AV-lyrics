<song artist="John_Mayer" title="A_Face_To_Call_Home">
I am an architect
Of days that haven't happened yet
I can't believe a month is all it's been
You know my paper heart
The one I fill with pencil marks
I think I might have gone and inked you in
Little by little, inch by inch
We built a yard with a garden in the middle of it
It ain't much but it's a start
You got me swaying right along to the song in your heart
And a face to call home
A face to call home
A face to call home
So good you didn't see
The nervous wreck I used to be
You'd never know a man could feel so small
And you never look at me
Like I'm a liability
I bet you think I've never been at all
Little by little, inch by inch
We built a yard with a garden in the middle of it
It ain't much but it's a start
You got me swaying right along to the song in your heart
And a face to call home
A face to call home
A face to call home
Maybe I could stay awhile
I'm talking like all of the time
Little by little, inch by inch
We built a yard with a garden in the middle of it
It ain't much but it's a start
You got me swaying right along to the song in your heart
And a face to call home
A face to call home
A face to call home
