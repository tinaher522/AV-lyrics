Six numbers one more to dial
Before I'm before you
And I tried to call-been busy all night
Gave up waiting at daylight
Excuse me Mrs. Busybody
Could you pencil me in when you can
Though we both know that the worst part about it
Is I would be free when you wanted me
If you wanted me
Ooooo I am the man on the side
Hopin' you'll make up your mind
I am the one who will swallow his pride
Life as the man on the side
One of the many
One of the few
To stand back and wait for you
Excuse me Mrs. Busybody
Could you pencil me in when you can
Though we both know that the worst part about it
Is I would be free when you wanted me
If you wanted me
If you wanted me
Ooooo I am the man on the side
Hopin' you'll make up your mind
I am the one who will swallow his pride
Life as the man on the side
Life as the man on the side
I fell in love with a dream that I built of you
Playin' the part of the queen
Taking my own advice
I'm giving up tonight good luck to you
and the king
Excuse me Mrs. Busybody
Could you pencil me in 
Though we both know that the worst part about it
Is I would be free when you wanted me
If you wanted me
If you wanted me
I am the man on the side
Hopin' you'll make up your mind
I am the one who will swallow his pride
Life as the man 
You know life as the man
Livin' life as the man on the side
