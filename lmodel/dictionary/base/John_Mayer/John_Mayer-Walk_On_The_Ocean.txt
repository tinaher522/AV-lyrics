<song artist="John_Mayer" title="Walk_On_The_Ocean">
We spotted the ocean
At the head of the trail
Where are we goin'
So far away
And somebody told me
That this is the place
Where everything's better
And everything's safe
CHORUS:
Walk on the ocean
Step on the stones
Flesh becomes water
Wood becomes bone
Half an hour later
We packed up our things
We said we'd send letters
And all of those little things
And they knew we were lyin'
But they smiled just the same
It seemed they'd already
Forgotten we came
(CHORUS X 2)
Back at the homestead
Where the air makes you choke
And people don't know you
And trust is a joke
We don't even have pictures
Just memories to hold
That grow sweeter each season
As we slowly grow old
