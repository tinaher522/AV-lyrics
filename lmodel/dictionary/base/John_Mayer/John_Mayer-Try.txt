<song artist="John_Mayer" title="Try">
Takes four days to get to like me
But two to wanna leave
But the part that really gets me
Is the moments in between
I lie to get a little
And laugh at every little thing
She's high on information
Now I'm low on self-esteem
I'm gonna try, try
Gonna try
Try to be myself
Although myself I wonder why
I'm gonna try, try
Gonna try
Try to be myself this time
I'm a hundred kinds of crazy
But I only wanna find
One sweet little angel
Who's gonna let me speak my mind
All I ever do these days
Is knock my process down
She's making her decision
Now I'm losing all of my ground
I'm gonna try, try
Gonna try
Try to be myself
Although myself I wonder why
I'm gonna try, try
Gonna try
Try to be myself
I wanna try to be myself this time
Easy does it now
Keep your damn mouth shut
She thinks I hot already
Don't go and press your luck
No news is good news coming
You gotta wait to find
You know you're gonna blow it
Every single time
I'm gonna try, try
Gonna try
Try to be myself
Although myself I wonder why
I'm gonna try, try
Gonna try
Try to be myself
I wanna try to be myself this time
