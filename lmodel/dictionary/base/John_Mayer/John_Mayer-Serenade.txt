<song artist="John_Mayer" title="Serenade">
Some of us, we're hardly ever here
The rest of us, we're born to disappear
How do I stop myself from being just a number
How do I hold my head to keep from going under
Down to the wire
I wanted water but I'll walk through the fire
If this is what it takes to take me even higher
Then I'll come through like I do
When the world keeps testing me, testing me, testing me
How did they find me here, what do they want from me
All of these vultures hanging right outside my door
I hear them whisperin', they're tryin' to ride it out
They've never gone this long without a kill before
Down to the wire
I wanted water but I'll walk through the fire
If this is what it takes to take me even higher
Then I'll come through like I do
When the world keeps testing me, testing me, testing me
Wheels up, I got to leave this evening
Can't seem to keep these vultures
Out of my tree, sometimes he says trail
Powers is made, by power being taken
I keep on running to protect
Sometimes he says control my situation
Down to the wire
I wanted water but I'll walk through the fire
If this is what it takes to take me even higher
Then I'll come through like I do
When the world keeps testing me, testing me, testing
Whatcha gonna do about it?
Whatcha gonna do about it?
Whatcha gonna do about it?
