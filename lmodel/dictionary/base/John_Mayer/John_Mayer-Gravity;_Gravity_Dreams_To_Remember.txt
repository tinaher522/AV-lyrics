"Gravity"
I got dreams, dreams to remember
I got dreams, dre-e-e-ams to remember
I got dreams, oh-woh-woh-woh-woh i got dreams
I got dreams, to remember, to remember
Oh Gravity oh gravity oooooh
Gravity is working against me
And gravity wants to bring me down
Oh I'll never know what makes this man
With all the love that his heart can stand
Dream of ways to throw it all away
Oh Gravity is working against me
And gravity wants to bring me down
Oh twice as much aint twice as good
And can't sustain like a one half could
It's wanting more
That's gonna send me to my knees
[repeat]
Oh gravity, stay the hell away from me
And gravity has taken better men than me (Now how can that be?)
Just keep me where the light is
Just keep me where the light is
Keep you all where the light is
Just keep us where the light is
Ohh.. where the light is! [repeat]
