<song artist="John_Mayer" title="Patience_(cover_-_Guns_'N'_Roses)">
Was a time when I wasn't sure
But you set my mind at ease
There is no doubt
You're in my heart now
Said, woman, take it slow
It'll work itself out fine
You and I've got what it takes to make it
Said, woman, take it slow
and no no no no no
You and I got just a little patience
I sit here on the stairs
'Cause I'd rather be alone
If I can't have you right now
I'll wait, dear
Sometimes I get so tense
But I can't speed up the time
But you know, love
There's one more thing to consider
Said, woman, take it slow
And the lights are shinning bright
You no no no no no no ah baby
Said, woman, take it slow
It'll work itself out fine
All we need is just a little patience
-I wanna try and see if I can do this solo
Just a little patience, yeah
Some more patience, yeah
-Goes like this, it goes like this...
I BEEN WALKIN' THE STREETS AT NIGHT
JUST TRYIN' TO GET IT RIGHT
HARD TO SEE WITH SO MANY AROUND
YOU KNOW I DON'T LIKE
BEING STUCK IN THE CROWD
AND THE STREETS DON'T CHANGE
BUT BABY THE NAME
I AIN'T GOT TIME FOR THE GAME
'CAUSE I NEED YOU
YEAH, WELL I NEED YOU
OO, WELL I NEED YOU
OO, I NEED YOU
OO, ALL THIS TIME
