<song artist="John_Mayer" title="Edge_Of_Desire">
Young and full of running, tell me where has that taken me?
Just a great figure eight or a tiny infinity?
Love is really nothing
But a dream that keeps waking me
For all of my trying, we still end up dying
How can it be?
Don't say a word, just come over and lie here with me
'Cause I'm just about to set fire to everything I see
I want you so bad I'll go back on the things I believe
There I just said it, I'm scared you'll forget about me
So young and full of running
All the way to the edge of desire
Steady my breathing, silently screaming
I have to have you now
Wired and I'm tired
Think I'll sleep in my clothes on the floor
Or maybe this mattress will spin on its axis
And find me on yours
Don't say a word, just come over and lie here with me
'Cause I'm just about to set fire to everything I see
I want you so bad I'll go back on the things I believe
There I just said it, I'm scared you'll forget about me
