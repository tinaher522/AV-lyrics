<song artist="John_Mayer" title="Paper_Doll">
Paper doll come try it on
And step out of that black chiffon
Here's a dress of gold and blue
Sure was fun being good to you
This one we made just for fall
And winter runs a bit too small
This mint green is new for spring
My love didn't cost a thing
You're like 22 girls in one
And none of them know what they're running from
Was it just too far to fall
For a little paper doll?
Fold a scarf, Moroccan red
And tie your hair behind your head
Strap into some heels that hurt
You shoulda kept my undershirt
You're like 22 girls in one
And none of them know what they're running from
Was it just too far to fall
For a little paper doll?
Cut the cord and pull some strings
And make yourself some angel wings
And if those angel wings don't fly
Someone's gonna paint you another sky
'Cause you're like 22 girls in one
And none of them know what they're running from
Was it just too far to fall
Was it just too far to fall
