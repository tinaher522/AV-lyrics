<song artist="Radiohead" title="Morning_Bell-Amnesiac">
The morning bell
The morning bell
Light another candle
Release me
Release me
You can keep the furniture
A bump on the head
Howling down the chimney
Release me
Release me, yeah
Release me
Release me
Where'd you park the car?
Where'd you park the car?
Clothes are on the lawn with the furniture
And I might as well
I might as well
Sleepy jack the fire drill
Round and round and round and round and round and round
Cut the kids in half
Cut the kids in half
Cut the kids in half
Release me
Release me
Release me
Release me
