<song artist="Radiohead" title="Palo_Alto">
In a city of the future
It is difficult to concentrate
Meet the boss, meet the wife
Everybody's happy
Everyone is made for life
In a city of the future
It is difficult to find a space
I'm too busy to see you
You're too busy to wait
But I'm OK, how are you?
Thanks for asking
Thanks for asking
I'm OK, how are you?
I hope that you're OK too
Everyone of those days
When the sky is Californian blue
In a beautiful bombshell
I throw myself into my world
I'm too lazy
I've been kidding myself for too long
I'm OK, how are you?
Thanks for asking
Thanks for asking
I'm OK, how are you?
I hope that you're OK too
