<song artist="Radiohead" title="Weird_Fishes-Arpeggi">
In the deepest ocean, the bottom of the sea
Your eyes, they turn me
Why should I stay here?
Why should I stay?
I'd be crazy not to follow
Follow where you lead
Your eyes, they turn me
Turn me into phantoms
I follow to the edge of the earth and fall off
Yeah, everybody leaves if they get the chance
And this is my chance
I get eaten by the worms and weird fishes
Picked over by the worms and weird fishes
Weird fishes, weird fishes
Yeah, I hit the bottom, hit the bottom and escape, escape
I hit the bottom, hit the bottom and escape, escape
