<song artist="Radiohead" title="Bishop's_Robes">
Dressed in bishop's robes
Terrifies me still
In bishop's robes
Bastard headmaster
I am not going back
I am not going back
I am not going back
Children taught to kill
To tear themselves to bits
On playing fields
Dressed in bishop's robes
I am not going back
I am not going back
I am not going back
