<song artist="Radiohead" title="Life_In_A_Glasshouse">
Once again
I'm in trouble with my only friend
She is papering the window panes
She is putting on a smile
Living in a glass house
Once again
Packed like frozen food and battery hens
Think of all the starving millions
Don't talk politics and don't throw stones
Your royal highnesses
Well, of course I'd like to sit around and chat
Well, of course I'd like to stay and chew the fat
Well, of course I'd like to sit around and chat
But someone's listening in
Once again
We are hungry for a lynching
That's a strange mistake to make
You should turn the other cheek 
Living in a glass house
Well, of course I'd like to sit around and chat
Well, of course I'd like to stay and chew the fat
Well, of course I'd like to sit around and chat
Only, only, only 
Only, only, only
Only, only, only
Only, only, only 
If someone's listening in
