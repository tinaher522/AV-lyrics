<song artist="Radiohead" title="A_Reminder">
If I get old, I will not give in
But if I do, remind me of this
Remind me that
Once I was free
Once I was cool 
Once I was me
And if I sit down and cross my arms
Hold me up to this song
Knock me out, smash out my brains
If I take a chair, start to talk shit
If I get old, remind me of this
That we kissed and I really meant it
Whatever happens, if we're still speaking
Pick up the phone, play me this song
