<song artist="Radiohead" title="Paranoid_Android">
Please could you stop the noise, I'm trying to get some rest
From all the unborn chicken voices in my head
What's that? (I may be paranoid, but not an android)
What's that? (I may be paranoid, but not an android)
When I am king you will be first against the wall
With your opinion which is of no consequence at all
What's that? (I may be paranoid, but no android)
What's that? (I may be paranoid, but no android)
Ambition makes you look pretty ugly
Kicking, squealing Gucci little piggy
You don't remember, you don't remember
Why don't you remember my name?
Off with his head, man, off with his head, man
Why don't he remember my name, I guess he does
Rain down, rain down
Come on, rain down on me
From a great height, from a great height
Height
Rain down, rain down
Come on, rain down on me
From a great height, from a great height
Height
That's it, sir, you're leaving (rain down)
The crackle of pigskin (rain down, come on, rain)
The dust and the screaming (down on me)
The yuppies networking
The panic, the vomit (from a great height)
The panic, the vomit (from a great height)
God loves his children
God loves his children, yeah
