<song artist="Radiohead" title="Myxomatosis._(Judge,_Jury_&_Executioner.)">
The mongrel cat came home
Holding half a head
Proceeded to show it off
To all his new found friends
He said, "I've been where I liked
I've slept with who I liked
She ate me up for breakfast
She screwed me in a vice
But now
I don't know why I feel so tongue-tied
I sat in the cupboard
And wrote it down in neat
They were cheering and waving
Cheering and waving
Twitching and a-salivating like with myxomatosis
But it got edited, fucked up
Strangled beaten up
Used in a photo in Time magazine
Buried in a burning black hole in Devon
And I don't know why I feel so tongue-tied
Don't know why I feel so skinned alive
My thoughts are misguided and a little naive
I twitch and I salivate like with myxomatosis
You should put me in a home or you should put me down
I got myxomatosis
I got myxomatosis
Yeah, no one likes a smartarse but we all like stars
That wasn't my intention (tension), I did it for a reason (treason)
It must have got mixed up
Strangled, beaten up
I got myxomatosis
I got myxomatosis
And I don't know why I feel so tongue-tied
