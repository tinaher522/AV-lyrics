<song artist="Radiohead" title="Up_On_The_Ladder">
I'm stuck in the tardis
trapped in hyperspace
one minute snake charming
the next in a motorcade
all the right moves and
earn the right percent
watch me dance 
I'm a puppet
you can almost see the strings
give me an answer
give me a line
I've been climbing up this ladder
I've been wasting my time
(so long, so long)
(so long, so long)
up on the ladder
out of time to escape
up on the ladder
we wait for your mistake
up on the ladder
try to call out your name
up on the ladder
you're all the fucking same
(oh, you let the people down)
(you let the people down)
(you let the people down)
