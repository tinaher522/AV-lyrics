<song artist="Radiohead" title="Blow_Out">
In my mind
I'm nailed to heels
All the time
Killing what I feel
And everything I touch (all wrapped up in cotton wool, all wrapped up and sugar coated)
Turns to stone
Everything I touch (all wrapped up in cotton wool, all wrapped up and sugar coated)
Turns to stone
I am fused
Just in case I blow out
I am glued
Just because I crack out
Everything I touch
Turns to stone
Everything I touch (all wrapped up in cotton wool, all wrapped up and sugar coated)
Turns
