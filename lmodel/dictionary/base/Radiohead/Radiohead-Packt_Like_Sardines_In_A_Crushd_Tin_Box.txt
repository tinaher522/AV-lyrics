<song artist="Radiohead" title="Packt_Like_Sardines_In_A_Crushd_Tin_Box">
After years of waiting
Nothing came
As your life flashed before your eyes
You realize
I'm a reasonable man, get off, get off, get off my case
I'm a reasonable man, get off my case, get off my case
After years of waiting
After years of waiting
Nothing came
And you realize you're looking in
Looking in the wrong place
I'm a reasonable man, get off my case, get off my case
I'm a reasonable man, get off my case
Get off my case, get off my case
I'm a reasonable man, get off my case
Get off my case, get off my case
After years of waiting
I'm a reasonable man, get off my case
Get off my case, get off my case
I'm a reasonable man, get off my case
Get off my case, get off my case
I'm a reasonable man, get off my case
Get off my case, get off my case
I'm a reasonable man, get off my case
Get off my case, get off my case
