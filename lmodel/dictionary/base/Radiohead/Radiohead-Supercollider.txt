<song artist="Radiohead" title="Supercollider">
Super collider
Dust in a moment
Particles scatter
Parting from the soup
Swimming upstream
Before the heavens crack open
Thin pixelations
Coming out from the dark
In a blue light
In a green light
In a half life
In a work light
I’m a B-spin
Flip flopping
I’m a pulse wave
Outstepping
I’ll put the shadows back into
The boxes
I am open
I am welcome
For a fraction
Of a second
I have jettisoned my illusions
I have dislodged my depressions
And put the shadows back into
The boxes
I've seen the angels hanging over the balcony
