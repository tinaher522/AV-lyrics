<song artist="Radiohead" title="I_Can't">
Please forget the words
That I just blurted out
It wasn't me, it was
My strange and creeping doubt
It keeps rattling my cage
And there's nothing in this world will keep it down
And even though I might, even though I try
I can't
Even though I might, even though I try
I can't
Soon your things that keep
That keep me underground
So many words that I
That I can never find
If you give up on me now
I'll be gutted like I've never been before
And even though I might, even though I try
I can't
Even though I might, even though I try
I can't
If you give up on me now
I'll be gutted like I've never been before
And even though I might, even though I try
I can't
Even though I might, even though I try
I can't
Even though I might, even though I try
I can't
Even though I might, even though I try
I can't
