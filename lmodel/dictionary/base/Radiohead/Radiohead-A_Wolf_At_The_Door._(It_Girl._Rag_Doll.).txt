<song artist="Radiohead" title="A_Wolf_At_The_Door._(It_Girl._Rag_Doll.)">
Drag him out your window, dragging out the dead
Singing "I miss you", snakes and ladders
Flip the lid, out pops the cracker
Smacks you in the head
Knifes you in the neck, kicks you in the teeth
Steel toe caps, takes all your credit cards
Get up, get the gunge
Get the eggs
Get the flan in the face
The flan in the face
The flan in the face
Dance, you fucker, dance, you fucker
Don't you dare
Don't you dare
Don't you flan in the face
Take it with the love it's given
Take it with a pinch of salt
Take it to the tax man
Let me back
Let me back
I promise to be good
Don't look in the mirror
At the face you don't recognize
Help me, call the doctor, put me inside
Put me inside
Put me inside
Put me inside
Put me inside
I keep the wolf from the door
But he calls me up
Calls me on the phone
Tells me all the ways that he's gonna mess me up
Steal all my children if I don't pay the ransom
And I'll never see them again if I squeal to the cops
Walking like giant cranes
And with my X-ray eyes I strip you naked
In a tight little world
And are you on the list?
Stepford wives, who are we to complain?
Investments and dealers
Investments and dealers
Cold wives and mistresses
Cold wives and Sunday papers
City boys in first class don't know they're born little
Someone else is gonna come and clean it up
Born and raised for the job, someone always does
I wish you'd get up, get over
Get up, get over
Turn your tape off
I keep the wolf from the door
But he calls me up
Calls me on the phone
Tells me all the ways that he's gonna mess me up
Steal all my children if I don't pay the ransom
And I'll never see them again if I squeal to the cops
So I'm just going oh
