<song artist="Radiohead" title="4_Minute_Warning">
This is just a nightmare
Soon I'm gonna wake up
Someone's gonna bring me around
Running from the bombers
Hiding in the forest
Running through the fields
Laying flat on the ground
Just like everybody
Standing over heads
Running from the underground
This is your warning
Four minute warning
I don't want to hear it
I don't want to know
I just want to run and hide
This is just a nightmare
Soon I'm gonna wake up
Someone's gonna bring me around
This is a warning
Four minute warning
