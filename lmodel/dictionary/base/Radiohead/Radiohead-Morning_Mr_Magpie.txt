<song artist="Radiohead" title="Morning_Mr_Magpie">
You got some nerve coming here
You got some nerve coming here
You stole it all, give it back
You stole it all, give it back
Good morning, Mister Magpie
How are we today?
Now you've stolen all the magic
And took my memory
You know you should but you don't
You know you should but you don't
Good morning, Mister Magpie
How are we today?
Now you've stolen all the magic
Took my melody
