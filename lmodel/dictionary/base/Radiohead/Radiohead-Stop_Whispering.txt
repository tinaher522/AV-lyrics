<song artist="Radiohead" title="Stop_Whispering">
And the wise man say, "I don't want to hear your voice"
And the thin man say, "I don't want to hear your voice"
And they're cursing me
And they won't let me be
And there's nothing to say
And there's nothing to do
Stop whispering, start shouting
Stop whispering, start shouting
And the mother say, "We spit on your son some more"
And the buildings say, "We spit on your face some more"
And the feeling is
That there's something wrong
Because I can't find the words
And I can't find the songs
Stop whispering, start shouting
Stop whispering, start shouting
Dear sir, I have a complaint
Dear sir, I have a complaint
Can't remember what it is
It doesn't matter anyway
It doesn't matter anyway
Stop whispering
Stop whispering
Stop whispering
Stop whispering, start shout...
