<song artist="Radiohead" title="You_Never_Wash_Up_After_Yourself">
I must get out once in a while
Everything is starting to die
The dust settles, the worms dig
Spiders crawl over the bed
I must get out once in a while
I eat all day and now I'm fat
Yesterday's meal is hugging the plate
You never wash up after yourself
