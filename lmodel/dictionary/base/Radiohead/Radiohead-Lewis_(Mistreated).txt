<song artist="Radiohead" title="Lewis_(Mistreated)">
Bummed out again by your only business friend 
The smell of fear is thicker than you think
Don't do it, don't jump 
Changed shape to fit, in the end you just feel sick 
A million love songs under anaesthetic
Hey don't do it, don't jump 
Lewis, save yourself the pain, you'll never get there
Lewis, save yourself the pain, it never really mattered 
We never noticed, we never understood 
He just get crushed to fit, he never even smelt out the best 
It's the best, it's the best day of your life Lewis
Lewis, save yourself the pain, you'll never get there 
Lewis, save yourself the pain, it never really matters
No, I swear, I swear, I swear 
Oh, mistreated, a low corporate
Mistreated, a low corporate
I don't wanna to talk about it 
I don't have to talk about it 
I don't wanna to talk about Lewis, Lewis, Lewis
I don't wanna to talk about Lewis, Lewis, Lewis
