<song artist="Radiohead" title="Electioneering">
I will stop
I will stop at nothing
Say the right things
When electioneering
I trust I can rely on your votes
When I go forwards you go backwards
And somewhere we will meet
When I go forwards you go backwards
And somewhere we will meet
Riot shields
Voodoo economics, it's just, it's just
It's just business
Cattle prods and the IMF
I trust I can rely on your votes
When I go forwards you go backwards
And somewhere we will meet
When I go forwards you go backwards
And somewhere we will meet
