<song artist="Radiohead" title="Fitter_Happier">
Fitter, happier, more productive
Comfortable, not drinking too much
Regular exercise at the gym, three days a week
Getting on better with your associate employee contemporaries
At ease, eating well
No more microwave dinners and saturated fats
A patient better driver
A safer car, baby smiling in backseat
Sleeping well, no bad dreams
No paranoia, careful to all animals
Never washing spiders down the plughole
Keep in contact with old friends
Enjoy a drink now and then
Will frequently check credit at moral bank hole in wall
Favours for favours, fond but not in love
Charity standing orders, on Sundays ring road supermarket
No killing moths or putting boiling water on the ants
Car wash also on Sundays
No longer afraid of the dark or midday shadows
Nothing so ridiculously teenage and desperate, nothing so childish
At a better pace, slower and more calculated
No chance of escape, now self-employed
Concerned but powerless
An empowered and informed member of society
Pragmatism not idealism
Will not cry in public, less chance of illness
Tyres that grip in the wet, shot of baby strapped in backseat, a good memory
Still cries at a good film, still kisses with saliva
No longer empty and frantic
Like a cat tied to a stick that's driven into frozen winter shit
The ability to laugh at weakness
Calm, fitter, healthier and more productive
A pig in a cage on antibiotics
