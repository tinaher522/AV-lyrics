<song artist="Radiohead" title="Bullet_Proof..I_Wish_I_Was">
Limb by limb and tooth by tooth
it's tearing up inside of me
Every day, every hour
I wish that I
Was bulletproof
Wax me, mould me
Heat the pins and stab them in
You have turned me into this
Just wish that it
Was bulletproof
Was bulletproof
So pay me money, take a shot
Lead-fill the hole in me
I could burst a million bubbles
All surrogate
And bulletproof
And bulletproof
And bulletproof
Bulletproof
