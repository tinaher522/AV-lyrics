<song artist="Radiohead" title="Separator">
It's like I'm falling out of bed from a long and vivid dream
The sweetest flowered fruits are hanging from a tree
Falling off a giant bird thatâ€™s been carrying me
It's like I'm falling out of bed from a long and vivid dream
Just exactly as I remember
Every word, every gesture
I've my heart in my mouth
Like I'm falling out of bed from a long and vivid dream
Finally I'm free of all the weight I've been carrying
As that woman blows my cover
In the eye of the beholder
I'm a fish now out of water
Falling off a giant bird that's been carrying me
I fell open
I laid under
At the tip out
That was just your number
I wanna slip it over
And get back under
And if you think this is over then you're wrong
If you think this is over then you're wrong
(Wake me up, wake me up)
If you think this is over then you're wrong
(Wake me up, wake me up)
If you think this is over then you're wrong
(Wake me up, wake me up)
Like I'm falling out of bed from a long and vivid dream
(Wake me up, wake me up)
Finally I'm free of all the weight I've been carrying
When at last you give in
When at last you give in
(Wake me up, wake me up)
(Wake me up, wake me up)
(Wake me up, wake me up)
(Wake me up, wake me up)
