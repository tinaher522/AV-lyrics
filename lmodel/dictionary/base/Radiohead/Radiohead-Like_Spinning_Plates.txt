<song artist="Radiohead" title="Like_Spinning_Plates">
While you make pretty speeches 
I'm being cut to shreds
You feed me to the lions
A delicate balance
When this just feels like spinning plates
I'm living in cloud cuckoo land
And this just feels like spinning plates
My body's floating down a muddy river
