<song artist="Radiohead" title="The_Butcher">
Beauty will destroy your mind
Spare the gory details
Give them gift wrap
For the man with everything
Though I lived a lonely life
I was confused
I'm butcher
I Feel nothing
As it courses up my arms
The position of the worms
Up, up, through my heart
Into my brain
Arm a bit slack, a basic combination 
Cut out chopped liver on the block 
My heart's still pumping
My heart's still pumping
He's a worrier, worrier
He's a little bitch coming out of him
He's a worrier, worrier
He's a little bitch coming out of him
Coming out of him
