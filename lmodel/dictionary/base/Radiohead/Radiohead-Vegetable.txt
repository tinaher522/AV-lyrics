<song artist="Radiohead" title="Vegetable">
I never wanted anything but this
I worked hard, tried hard
I ran around in domestic bliss
I fought hard, died hard
Everytime you're running
Out of here
Everytime you're running
I get the fear
I never wanted any broken bones
Scarred face, no home
Your words surround me and I asphyxiate
And I burn all hate
Everytime you're running
Out on me
Everytime you're running
I can see
I'm not a vegetable
I will not control myself
I spit on the hand that feeds me
I will not control myself
The waters break, the waters run
All over me
The waters break, the waters run
And this time you're gonna pay
I'm not a vegetable
I will not control myself
I spit on the hand that feeds me
I will not control myself
