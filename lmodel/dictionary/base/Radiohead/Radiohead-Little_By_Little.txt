<song artist="Radiohead" title="Little_By_Little">
Turn to nasty now, the dark cell
The pillar of my salt
The last one out of the box
The one who broke the spell
Little by little, by hook or by crook
I'm such a tease and you're such a flirt
Once you've been hurt you've been around enough
Little by little, by hook or by crook
Never in earnest, never get judged
I don't know where it is, I should look
Your glue won't hold, the threat above
Recoiling with my love
The last one out of the box
The one who broke the seal
Obligations
Complications
Routines and schedules
Drug and kill you
Kill you
Little by little, by hook or by crook
Never in earnest, never get judged
I don't know where it is, I should look
Little by little, by hook or by crook
I am such a tease, and you're such a flirt
