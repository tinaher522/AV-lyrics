<song artist="Radiohead" title="Idioteque">
Who's in a bunker? Who's in a bunker?
Women and children first and the children first and the children
I'll laugh until my head comes off
I'll swallow till I burst, until I burst, until I
Who's in a bunker? Who's in a bunker?
I have seen too much, I haven't seen enough, you haven't seen
I'll laugh until my head comes off
Women and children first and children first and children
Here I'm allowed everything all of the time
Here I'm allowed everything all of the time
Ice age comin', ice age comin'
Let me hear both sides, let me hear both sides, let me hear both
Ice age comin', ice age comin'
Throw it in the fire, throw it in the fire, throw it on the
We're not scaremongering
This is really happening, happening
We're not scaremongering
This is really happening, happening
Mobiles working, mobiles chirping
Take the money and run, take the money and run, take the money
Here I'm allowed everything all of the time (The first of the children, the first of the children, the first of the children, the first of the children)
Here I'm allowed everything all of the time (The first of the children, the first of the, the first, the first of the children, the first of the children)
Here I'm allowed everything all of the time (The first of the children, the first of the, the first, the first of the children, the first of the children)
Here I'm allowed everything all of the time (The first of the children, the first of the children, the first of the children, the first of the children)
The first of the children, the first of the children
The first of the children, the first of the children
The first of the children, the first of the
The first, the first of the children, the first of the children
The first of the children, the first of the
The first, the first of the children, the first of the children
The first of the children, the first of the children
The first of the children, the first of the children
