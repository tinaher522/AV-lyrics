<song artist="Radiohead" title="Give_Up_The_Ghost">
Don't hurt me
Don't haunt me
Don't hurt me
Don't haunt me
Gather up the lost and the sold (Don't haunt me)
In your arms (Don't hurt me)
In your arms (Don't haunt me)
Gather up the pitiful (Don't haunt me)
In your arms (Don't hurt me)
In your arms (Don't haunt me)
In your arms (Don't hurt me)
In your arms (Don't haunt me)
What seems impossible (Don't hurt me)
In your arms (Don't haunt me)
In your arms (Don't hurt me)
I think I have had my fill (Don't hurt me)
In your arms (Don't haunt me)
In your arms (Don't hurt me)
In your arms (Don't haunt me)
In your arms (Don't hurt me)
I think I should give up the ghost (Don't hurt me)
In your arms (Don't haunt me)
In your arms (Don't hurt me)
In your arms (Don't haunt me)
In your arms (Don't hurt me)
In your arms (Don't haunt me)
In your arms (Don't hurt me)
In your arms (Don't haunt me)
In your arms (Don't hurt me)
In your arms (Don't haunt me)
In your arms (Don't hurt me)
In your arms (Don't haunt me)
In your arms (Don't hurt me)
In your arms (Don't haunt me)
In your arms (Don't hurt me)
