<song artist="Radiohead" title="Dollars_&_Cents">
There are better things to talk about
Be constructive
There are weapons we can use
Be constructive with your blues
Even when it's only warnings
Even when you're talking war games
Oh won't you quiet down? (I want peace and honesty)
Why don't you quiet down? (I want to live in the children's land and I know maybe I)
Won't you quiet down? (Maybe I'll wander the promised land, I want peace and honesty)
Why don't you quiet down? (I want to live in the promised land and maybe wander the children's land)
Quiet down (Yeah, and we'll be free)
You're doing living in a bed a sleeping
He never goes and you'll never stay
We'll have our goals in our liberal worlds
Living in times when I could stand it, babe
All over, baby's crying
It's all over, baby I can see out of here
All over, the planet's dead
All over the planet, so let me out of here
All over, all over, all over
Quiet down
(We are the dollars and cents and the pounds and pence)
(And the mark and the yen and yeah, we're going to)
Why don't you quiet down?
(Crack your little souls, we're going to crack your little souls)
Why don't you quiet down?
(We are the dollars and cents and the pounds and pence)
And the pounds and pence and yeah, we're going to)
Why don't you quiet down?
(Crack your little souls, crack your little souls)
We are the dollars and cents
