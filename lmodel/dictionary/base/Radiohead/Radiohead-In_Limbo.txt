<song artist="Radiohead" title="In_Limbo">
Lundy, Fastnet, Irish Sea
I got a message I can't read, I got a message I can't read
Lundy, Fastnet, Irish Sea
I got a message I can't read, I got a message I can't read
I'm on your side, nowhere to hide
Trapdoors that open I spiral down
You're living in a fantasy world, you're living in a fantasy world
I'm lost at sea, don't bother me
I've lost my way, I've lost my way
You're living in a fantasy world, you're living in a fantasy world
You're living in a fantasy world, the most beautiful world
Lundy, Fastnet, Irish Sea, I got a message I can't read
I got a message I can't read, I got a message I can't read
Lundy, Fastnet, Irish Sea, I got a message I can't read
I got a message I can't read, I got a message I can't read
Lundy, Fastnet, Irish Sea
