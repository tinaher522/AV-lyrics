<song artist="Radiohead" title="Lotus_Flower">
I will shape myself into your pocket
Invisible
Do what you want
Do what you want
I will shrink and I will disappear
I will slip into the groove
And cut me off
And cut me off
There's an empty space inside my heart
Where the weeds take root
Tonight I set you free
I'll set you free
There's an empty space inside my heart
Where the weeds take root
So now I set you free
I'll set you free
Slowly we unfurl as lotus flowers
'Cause all I want is the moon upon a stick
Just to see what if
Just to see what is
I can't kick your habit
Just to feel your fast-ballooning head
Listen to your heart
We will shrink and then be quiet as mice
And while the cat is away
Do what we want
Do what we want
There's an empty space inside my heart
Where the weeds take root
So now I set you free
I'll set you free
'Cause all I want is the moon upon a stick
Just to see what if
Just to see what is
Put this flower into my room
Slowly we unfurl as lotus flowers
'Cause all I want is the moon upon a stick
I dance around the pit
The darkness is beneath
I can't kick your habit
Just to feed your fast-ballooning head
Listen to your heart
