<song artist="Radiohead" title="Faithless,_The_Wonder_Boy">
I've had these jeans since I was born 
And now they're ripped
And now they're torn
And all my friends have skateboards
I want the toys of other boys
I want a knife and a gun and things
But mum and dad will not give in
And I can't put the needle in
I can't put the needle in
I can't put the needle in
No, I can't put the needle in
I can't put the needle in
I can't put the needle in
And now I know what it is
It's called disease and it's got my head
It always runs where I hide
Too scared to talk, too scared to try
Too scared to know the reasons why
And all my friends say bye bye
And I can't put the needle in
I can't put the needle in
I can't put the needle in
No, I can't put the needle in
I can't put the needle in
I can't put the needle in
And I can't put the needle in
I can't put the needle in
I can't put the needle in
No, I can't put the needle in
I can't put the needle in
I can't put the needle in
