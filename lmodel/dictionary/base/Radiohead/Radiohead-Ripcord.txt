<song artist="Radiohead" title="Ripcord">
Soul destroyed with clever toys
For little boys
It's inevitable, inevitable
It's a soul destroyed
You're free until you drop
You're free until you've had enough
And you don't understand
No ripcord
No ripcord
No ripcord
No ripcord
Aeroplane, do I mean
What I mean?
Oh, it's inevitable, inevitable
Oh, aeroplane
A thousand miles an hour
On politics and power
That she don't understand
No ripcord
No ripcord
No ripcord
No ripcord, yeah
The answer to your prayers
We'll drop you anywhere
No ripcord
No ripcord
No ripcord
No, no, no, no ripcord
Oh yeah
