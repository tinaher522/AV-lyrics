<song artist="Radiohead" title="A_Punchup_At_A_Wedding._(No_No_No_No_No_No_No_No.)">
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
I don't know why you bother
Nothing's ever good enough for you
I was there
It wasn't like that
You've come here just to start a fight
You had to piss on our parade
You had to shred our big day
You had to ruin it for all concerned
In a drunken punchup at a wedding, yeah
Hypocrite opportunist
Don't infect me with your poison
A bully in a china shop
When I turn â€˜round you stay frozen to the spot
You had the pointless snide remarks
Of hammerheaded sharks
The pot will call the kettle black
It's a drunken punchup at a wedding, yeah
Oh
No no...
