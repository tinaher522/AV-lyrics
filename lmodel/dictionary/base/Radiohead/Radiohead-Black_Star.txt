<song artist="Radiohead" title="Black_Star">
I get home from work and you're still standing in your dressing gown
Well, what am I to do?
I know all the things around your head
And what they do to you
What are we coming to?
What are we gonna do?
Blame it on the black star
Blame it on the falling sky
Blame it on the satellite
That beams me home
The troubled words of a troubled mind, I try to understand
What is eating you
I try to stay awake, but it's 58 hours
Since that I last slept with you
What are we coming to?
I just don't know anymore
Blame it on the black star
Blame it on the falling sky
Blame it on the satellite
That beams me home
I get on the train and I just stand about
Now that I don't think of you
I keep falling over, I keep passing out
When I see a face like you
What am I coming to?
I'm gonna melt down
Blame it on the black star
Blame it on the falling sky
Blame it on the satellite
That beams me home
This is killing me
This is killing me
