<song artist="Radiohead" title="Polyethylene_(Parts_1_&_2)">
Disjointed
Scare ourselves of all that you wanna be
Just got paid and now you're going
How inside you'll please
If I get scared I'll just call you
And I miss your glow as I unsettle
Oh and I'll always feel I will always be
Right, one, two, three, four
So sell your suit and tie and
Come and live with me
Leukemia schizophrenia
Polyethylene
There is no significant risk to your health
She used to be beautiful once as well
Plastic bag middle class
Polyethylene
Decaffeinated
Let it keep all surfaces clean
If you don't believe me, sell your soul
If you don't give into him, no one will
