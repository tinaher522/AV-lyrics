<song artist="Radiohead" title="Lozenge_Of_Love">
I am gone 
Everybody's raging 
And these fruits
They still taste of poison
I won't be around
When you really need me
I can't sleep 
Why can't someone hold me?
I need warm
My restless body cracks and moans
I won't have the strength 
When you really need me
