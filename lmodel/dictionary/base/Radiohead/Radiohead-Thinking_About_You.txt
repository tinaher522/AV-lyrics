<song artist="Radiohead" title="Thinking_About_You">
Been thinking about you
Your records are here
Your eyes are on my wall
Your teeth are over there
But I'm still no one
And you're now a star
What do you care?
Been thinking about you
And there's no rest
Shit, I still love you
Still see you in bed
But I'm playing with myself
And what do you care
When the other men are far, far better?
All the things you've got
All the things you need
Who bought you cigarettes
Who bribed the company to come and
See you, honey?
I've been thinking about you
So how can you sleep?
These people aren't your friends
They're paid to kiss your feet
They don't know what I know
And why should you care
When I'm not there?
Been thinking about you
And there's no rest
Should I still love you
Still see you in bed?
But I'm playing with myself
And what do you care
When I'm not there?
All the things you've got
She'll never need
All the things you've got
I've bled and I bleed to
Please you
Been thinking about you
