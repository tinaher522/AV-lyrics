<song artist="Radiohead" title="The_Trickster">
Rust in the mountains
Rust in the brain
The air is sacred here
In spite of your claim
Up on the roof tops
Out of reach
Trickster is meaningless
Trickster is weak
He's talking out the world
Talking out the world
Hey
Hey
Hey
This is only halfway
Hey
Hey
Hey
This is only halfway
I wanted you so bad 
And I couldn't say
All things fall apart
We wanted out so bad 
We couldn't say
These things fall apart
We're talking out the world
Talking out the world
Hey
Hey
Hey
This is only halfway
Hey
Hey
Hey
This is only halfway
Truant kids- a can of
Brick dust worms who do not want to
Climb down from their chestnut tree
Long white gloves
Police tread carefully
Escaped from the zoo
The perfect child facsimile
It's talking out the world
Talking out the world
Hey
Hey
Hey
Ooh
Hey
Hey
Hey
