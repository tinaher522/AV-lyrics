<song artist="Radiohead" title="Anyone_Can_Play_Guitar">
Destiny
Destiny, protect me from the world
Destiny
Hold my hand, protect me from the world
Here we are
With our running and confusion
And I don't see no confusion
Anywhere
And if the world does turn
And if London burns
I'll be standing on the beach
With my guitar
I want to be in a band
When I get to heaven
Anyone can play guitar and they won't
Be a nothing anymore
Grow my hair
Grow my hair, I am Jim Morrison
Grow my hair
I wanna be, wanna be, wanna be Jim Morrison
Here we are
With our running and confusion
And I don't see no confusion
Anywhere
And if the world does turn
And if London burns
I'll be standing on the beach
With my guitar
I want to be in a band
When I get to heaven
Anyone can play guitar and they won't
Be a nothing anymore
