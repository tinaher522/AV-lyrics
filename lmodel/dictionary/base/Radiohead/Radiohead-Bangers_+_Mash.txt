<song artist="Radiohead" title="Bangers_+_Mash">
You bit me, bit me, bit me, oh
You bit me, bit me, and now I want more
I'm standing in the hall
I'm puking on the wall
It's all been sent to the conger hall
The Bangers and the mash
The negatives for cash
You're either in the club, baby or you're not
Whatever turns you on
Whatever gets you off
Chief of police, or vice-chancellor
Lord and Lady Blah Blah the vicar and the judge
You're dancing to my little red book
Because you bit me, bit me, bit me, oh
I've got the poison, poison
And I want more
If you are on the top
Then it is a long drop
The pyramid is power
We're changing by the hour
If you are on the top
Then it is a long drop
If you stare into the dark,
The dark will stare back
Back into your soul
I'm taking you down
I'm taking you down
I'm taking you down when I go down
I'm taking you down
I'm taking you down
I'm standing in the hall
I'm puking on the wall Ya
Because you bit me, bit me, bit me, oh
The poison, I got the poison
I got the poison oh
Ya I've got the poison
