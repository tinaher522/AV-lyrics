<song artist="Radiohead" title="How_Do_You?">
He's bitter and twisted
He knows what he wants
He wants to be loved and
He wants to belong
He wants you to listen
He wants us to weep
And he was a stupid baby
Who turned into a powerful freak
But how do you?
How do you?
How do you?
He lives with his mother
But we show him respect
He's a dangerous bigot
But we always forget
And he's just like his daddy
'Cause he cheats on his friends
And he steals and he bullies
Any way that he can
But how do you?
How do you?
How do you?
