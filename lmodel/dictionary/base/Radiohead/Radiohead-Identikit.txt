<song artist="Radiohead" title="Identikit">
Sweet-faced ones with nothing left inside
That we all can love
That we all can love
That we all can
Sweet-faced ones with nothing left inside
That we all can love
That we all can love
That we all can
When I see you messing me around
I don't want to know
I don't want to know
I don't want
When I see you messing me around
I don't want to know
I don't want to know
I don't want to know
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Pieces of the wreck of mankind
That you can't create
That we can create
That we can
Pieces of the wreck of mankind
That you can't create
That we can create
That we can
But when I see you messing me around
And I don't want to know
I don't want to know
I don't want
When I see you messing me around
I don't want to know
I don't want to know
I don't want to know
