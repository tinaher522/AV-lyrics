<song artist="Radiohead" title="Last_Flowers">
Appliances have gone berserk
I cannot keep up
Treading on people's toes
Snot-nosed little punk
And I can't face the evening straight
You can offer me escape
Houses move and houses speak
If you take me there you'll get relief
Believe, relief, believe
And if I'm gonna talk
I just wanna talk
Please don't interrupt
Just sit back and listen
Cause I can't face the evening straight
You can offer me escape
Houses move and houses speak
If you take me there you'll get relief
Believe, relief, believe
Relief, believe
It's too much, too bright, too powerful
Too much, too bright, too powerful
Too much, too bright, too powerful
Too much, too bright, too powerful...
