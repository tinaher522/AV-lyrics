<song artist="Radiohead" title="Where_I_End_And_You_Begin._(The_Sky_Is_Falling_In.)">
There's a gap in between
There's a gap where we meet
Where I end and you begin
And I'm sorry for us
The dinosaurs roam the earth
The sky turns green
Where I end and you begin
I am up in the clouds
I am up in the clouds
And I can't and I can't come down
I can watch but not take part
Where I end and where you start
Where you, you left me alone
You left me alone
X will now mark the place
Like the parting of the waves
Like a house falling into the sea
Into the sea
I will eat you all alive
I will eat you all alive
I will eat you all alive
I will eat you all alive
There'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
I will eat you all alive
I will eat you all alive
I will eat you all alive
I will eat you all alive
And there'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
I will eat you all alive
I will eat you all alive
I will eat you all alive
I will eat you all alive
