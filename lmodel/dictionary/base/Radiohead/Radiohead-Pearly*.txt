<song artist="Radiohead" title="Pearly*">
How do you get your teeth so pearly?
Dewdrop dentures
White-washed fences
She runs from the third world, pearly
Vanilla (feel it crawl to me)
Milkshakes (crawl back again)
From hard rock (whatever you say)
Caf√©s (it won't go away)
That's where (I feel it crawl to me)
She got her (crawl back again)
Sweet tooth (it won't go away)
For white boys (whatever you say)
She runs from the third world, pearly
Use me 
Darling use me 
Darling use me 
Darling use me
