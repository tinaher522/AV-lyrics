<song artist="Radiohead" title="Glass_Eyes">
Hey it's me
I just got off the train
A frightening place
Their faces are concrete grey
And I'm wondering, should I turn around?
Buy another ticket
Panic is coming on strong
So cold, from the inside out
No great drama, no message coming in
In the oh so smug
Glassy eyed light of day
Glassy eyed light of day
Where path trails off
And heads down a mountain
Through the dry bush
I don't know where it leads
I don't really care
Where the path trails off
And heads down a mountain
Through the dry bush
I don't know where it leads
I don't really care
I feel this love to the core
I feel this love to the core
