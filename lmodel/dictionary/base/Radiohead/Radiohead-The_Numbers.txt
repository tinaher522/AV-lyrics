<song artist="Radiohead" title="The_Numbers">
It holds us like a phantom
It touches like a breeze
It shines its understanding
See the moon smiling
Open on all channels
Ready to receive
We're not at the mercy
Of your shimmerers or spells
Your shimmerers or spells, mmm
We are of the earth
To her we do return
The future is inside us
It's not somewhere else
It's not somewhere else
It's not somewhere else
(One day at a time)
One day at a time
We call upon the people
People have this power
The numbers don't decide
The system is a lie
The river has run dry
The wings of butterflies
And you may pour us away like soup
Like a pretty broken flower
We'll take back what is ours
We'll take back what is ours
One day at a time
