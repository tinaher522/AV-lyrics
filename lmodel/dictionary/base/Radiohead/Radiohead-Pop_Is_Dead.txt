<song artist="Radiohead" title="Pop_Is_Dead">
Oh no, pop is dead
Long live pop
It died an ugly death
By back catalogue
And know you know it gets you nowhere
And now you know you realise
Oh no, pop is dead
It just gave up
We raise the dead
But they won't stand up
And radio has salmonella
And now you know you gotta die
It left this message for us
So what, pop is dead
It's no great loss
So many face lifts
It's face flew off
The Emperor he has no clothes on
And his skin is pealing off
Oh no, pop is dead
Long live pop
One final lot of coke
To jack him off
Jack him off
He left this message for us
He left this message for us
He left this message for us
