<song artist="Radiohead" title="These_Are_My_Twisted_Words">
These are my twisted words
When I feel you still walking
I know I should not look down
But I’m so sick of just talking
When are you coming back?
I just can’t handle it
When are you coming back?
I just can’t handle it
When are you coming back?
I just can’t stand it
I just can’t handle it
