<song artist="Radiohead" title="Scatterbrain._(As_Dead_As_Leaves.)">
I'm walking out in a force ten gale
Birds thrown around, bullets for hail
The roof is pulling off by its fingernails
Your voice is rapping on my windowsill
Yesterday's headlines blown by the wind
Yesterday's people end up scatterbrain
Then any fool can easy pick a hole, I only wish I could fall in
A moving target in a firing range
Somewhere I'm not scatterbrain
Somewhere I'm not scatterbrain
Lightning fuse, power cut, scatterbrain
