<song artist="Radiohead" title="Man-O-War">
Drift all you like from ocean to ocean
Search the whole worid drunken confessione
And hijacks and films just make you moan alone
If you come home i'll make you a cake
Lay your velvet eyes
I wish i couid see you just when i kill
You're my man o war
And the worms will eat you whole
So unplug your phone
Stop all the chatter
It all comes flooding back
From poisoned clouds
To poison the world
You're my man o war
And the worms will eat you whole, my love
And the worms will eat your home
You whole my love
