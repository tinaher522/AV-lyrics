<song artist="Radiohead" title="Let_Down">
Transport, motorways and tram lines
Starting and then stopping
Taking off and landing
The emptiest of feelings
Disappointed people
Clinging on to bottles
And when it comes it's so, so
Disappointing
Let down and hanging around
Crushed like a bug in the ground
Let down and hanging around
Shell smashed, juices flowing
Wings twitch, legs are going
Don't get sentimental
It always ends up drivel
One day, I am gonna
Grow wings, a chemical reaction
Hysterical and useless
Hysterical and
Let down and hanging around
Crushed like a bug in the ground
Let down and hanging around
Let down and hanging
Let down and hanging
Let down and hanging
You'll know
You'll know where you are when
You'll know where you are when
Floor collapsing
Floating, bouncing back
And one day, I am gonna grow wings
A chemical reaction (you'll know where you are)
Hysterical and useless (you'll know where you are)
Hysterical and (you'll know where you are)
Let down and hanging around
Crushed like a bug in the ground
Let down and hanging around
