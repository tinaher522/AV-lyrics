<song artist="Alunageorge" title="We_Are_Chosen">
Watching, you slip through the cracks 
Then you came back 
see those faces, listen to you 
Their world is new 
(You) you so simple intuition boy 
With your vision you can bring me joy 
You're getting under my skin, under my skin 
you're getting under my skin 
(Bring) bring a little revolution here 
Show me love will take away my fear 
(Show me) show me how you're gonna bring me near 
Now that you started a fire you can't put it out 
I'll be frozen 
Something inside me was choking when you let it out 
We are chosen 
Watching, you slip through the cracks 
Then you came back 
(You) you so simple intuition boy 
With your vision you can bring me joy 
You're getting under my skin, under my skin 
You're getting under my skin 
(Bring) bring a little revolution here 
(Show me) show me love will take away my fear 
Show me how you're gonna bring me near 
Now that you started a fire you can't put it out 
I'll be frozen 
Something inside me was choking when you let it out 
We are chosen 
Now that you started a fire you can't put it out 
I'll be frozen 
Something inside me was choking when you let it out 
We are chosen 
Now that you started a fire you can't put it out 
I'll be frozen 
Something inside me was choking when you let it out 
We are chosen 
Now that you started a fire you can't put it out 
I'll be frozen 
Something inside me was choking when you let it out 
We are chosen
