<song artist="Alunageorge" title="Kaleidoscope_Love">
You show me things in a different light
Things that were wrong go right
You and me making chemical equations
Deadly combinations
Dangerous situations running out in the magic of the night
Stepping out of these restless days of disappointed haze
And it's where I want to be and it's all I want to do
Cause nothing else makes me weightless like your light reflecting gaze
I don't think you even realise what you do
I'm crystallised, cos you're my kaleidoscope love
I think about you all the time, you're in the atmosphere
I try to touch your silhouette even though I know that you were never here
Shudders and waves, but there's no more fear
I just can't get enough
Stepping out of these restless days of disappointed haze
I don't think you even realise what you do
I'm crystallised, cos you're my kaleidoscope love
You show me things in a different light
Things that were wrong go right
You and me making chemical equations
Deadly combinations running out in the magic of the night
I'm crystallised, cos you're my kaleidoscope love
