<song artist="Alunageorge" title="I'm_In_Control">
I'm in control
I like crashing waves
But I want to see them at first light After a long night
And see the sky take shape
But I want to see the stars burn
After I've had my turn
And ooh, ooh
You're working so hard
You played your card, so what's the payoff?
And ooh, ooh
Big talk is cheap
You gotta go deeper than deep to get me off
If you're picking up my call
Gotta tell you once you know that
I'm in control
I'm in control
Don't you know I want it all?
Put your hands against the wall
I'm in control, I'm in control
I'm in control
She a fill a machine gun shoot at mi love Gyal get caught up
when mi turn high up
Boy
knows she gon start, wind up
Love how she smile when we run, tied up
Be a, be a full o' action like [?] Ya not [?] like [?]
Bubble like champagne, I spray gun
All night, me'll give you love
And ooh, ooh
You're working so hard
You played your card, so what's the payoff?
And ooh, ooh
Big talk is cheap
You gotta go deeper than deep to get me off
If you're picking up my call
Gotta tell you once you know that
I'm in control, I'm in control
Don't you know I want it all?
Put your hands against the wall
I'm in control, I'm in control
I'm in control (All night, me'll give you love)
(Control of me love)
I'm in control
Hey gal
Control of you, control of the master
Tonight me'll take off your shorts
I'ma feel up your fat pum pumin' out your drawers
All night, mi a watchin' on you dance
Oh right mi a pree for your legs, run faster
You [?] all over your [?]
So you're in control, but mi a real master (I'm in control)
If you're picking up my call
Gotta tell you once you know that (Cause she in control of me love)
I'm in control
Don't you know I want it all?
Put your hands against the wall (Cause she in control of me love)
I'm in control
