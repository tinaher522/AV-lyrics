<song artist="Alunageorge" title="Body_Music">
Thinking about all the ways to connect me to your world
Not enough to replace all the details
I'm uncurled like a bud
When the spring has come too early and I wait for the summer
I tried to deny is something more that I need
Not just an echo
I need to get that high that I felt before
And the greed just won't let go
Your body is like music, baby
I wanna play it again
Your body is like music, baby
I only feel it when
Our bodies making music, baby
I wanna do it again
Your body is like music, baby
I only hear it when we are as one
Soaked to the skin as I run from my patience wearing thin
But my heart has begun a revolution deep within
So I know that I have to find a way to your embrace once again
I tried to deny there is something more that I need
Not just an echo
I need to get that high feeling that I felt before
And the greed just won't let go
Your body is like music, baby
I wanna play it again
Your body is like music, baby
I only feel it when
Our bodies making music, baby
I wanna do it again
Your body is like music, baby
I only hear it when we are as one
