This is how we do it 
[This is how we do it]
[This is how we do it]
This is how we do it on Friday night
And I feel all right
The party's here on the West side
So I reach for my 40 and I turn it up
Designated driver take the keys to my truck
Hit the Shaw because I'm faded
Honeys in the street say, "Monty, yo we made it!"
It feels so good in my hood tonight
The summertime skirts and the guys in Kani
All the gang bangers forgot about the drive-by
You gotta get your groove on, before you go get paid
So tip up your cup and throw your hands up
And let me hear the party say
I'm kinda buzzed and it's all because [This is how we do it]
Yo London does it like nobody does [This is how we do it]
To all my neighbours you got much flava [This is how we do it]
Let's flip the track, bring the old school back [This is how we do it]
This is how we do it, all hands are in the air
And you wave them from here to there
If you're an O.G. mack or a wanna-be playa
You see the hood's been good to me
Ever since I was a lower-case G
But now I'm a big G, boys see I got the money
Hundred dollar bills y'all
If you were from where I'm from then you would know
That I gotta get mine in a big black truck
You can get yours in a '64
Whatever it is, the party's underway
So tip up your cup and throw your hands up
And let me hear the party say
I'm kinda buzzed and it's all because [This is how we do it]
Ooh London does it like nobody does [This is how we do it]
To all my neighbours you got much flava [This is how we do it]
Let's flip the track, bring the old school back [This is how we do it]
[This is how we do it]
[This is how we do it]
[This is how we do it]
[This is how we do it]
