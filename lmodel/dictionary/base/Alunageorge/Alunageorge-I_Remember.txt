<song artist="Alunageorge" title="I_Remember">
In the fabric, In the folds
Lost memories get old
Tiny love left unsaid
Like grains of sand left in my bed
I've been trying
Ooh, dancing away the dead gone days
I've been flying
Ooh, the moment that I see your face…
I remember, I remember, I remember goodbye
And the salted rain runing from your eyes
I remember, I remember, I remember the fights
Burning deep into the night
I remember, I remember, I remember your scent
When I just woke up and I'm on your chest
I remember, I remember, I remember the sound
Of your heart racing when you do bad things to me
I wanna feel like it's the first night
I wanna meet you for the first time
I remember, I remember, I remember your smile
When your face lit up and it felt so right
A coincidence or a trap
Special moment or a slap
Tiny love will attack
As it gets bigger behind your back
I've been trying
Ooh, dancing away the dead gone days
I've been flying
Ooh, the moment that I see your face…
I remember, I remember, I remember goodbye
And the salted rain running from your eyes
I remember, I remember, I remember the fights
Burning deep into the night
I remember, I remember, I remember your scent
When I just woke up and I'm on your chest
I remember, I remember, I remember the sound
Of your heart racing when you do bad things to me
I wanna feel like it's the first night
I wanna meet you for the first time
I remember, I remember, I remember your smile
When your face lit up and it felt so right
I remember, I remember, I remember your scent
When I just woke up and I'm on your chest
I remember, I remember, I remember the sound
Of your heart racing when you do bad things to me
I wanna feel like it's the first night
I wanna meet you for the first time
I remember, I remember, I remember your smile
When your face lit up and it felt so right
