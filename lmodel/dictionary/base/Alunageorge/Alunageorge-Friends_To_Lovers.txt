<song artist="Alunageorge" title="Friends_To_Lovers">
I usually wait for you to call
But it's getting closer between me and you
I usually make sure that I know you want me around
But that's getting old and a change is due
How do you make the change from friends to lovers
When you risk looking like a fool?
Maybe it would be safer playing sister and brother
But I'm going crazy trying to stay cool
We could be perfect, we could be useless
It could be worth finding out
We could be wasting time
Maybe this feeling I have is a sign
Why do I have my doubts?
Sometimes when you look me in the eye
You hold it for too long and I start to blush
Sometimes when you say hello and take me in your arms
You hold me strong and I get this rush
How do we make the change from friends to lovers
When you risk looking like a fool?
Maybe it would be safer playing sister and brother
But I'm going crazy trying to stay cool
We could be perfect, we could be useless
It could be worth finding out
We could be wasting time
Maybe this feeling I have is a sign
Why do I have my doubts?
I need to wake up
Before I do something to mess up everything but
We could be perfect, we could be useless
It could be worth finding out
We could be wasting time
Maybe this feeling I have is a sign
Why do I have my doubts?
