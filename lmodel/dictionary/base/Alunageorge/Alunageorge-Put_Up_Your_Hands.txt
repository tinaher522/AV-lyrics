Put up your hands, hands, hands, hands
Put up your hands, hands, hands, hands
I got a million emails in the box
Unread, from you 
What you're trying to do?
I gotta sail, the ship sailed
But you got your head confused
What you're trying to prove?
Work it out, work it out
You won't get nothing from me
Baby don't you see?
I'm now, what you know, what you know
There's no way in coming back
Baby don't look back, to me
Why don't you save yourself,
From all this trouble
And just put up your hands, hands, hands, hands
Put up your hands, hands, hands, hands
Put up your hands, hands, hands, hands
So just put up your hands, hands, hands, hands
Why don't you save yourself,
From all this trouble
And just put up your hands, hands, hands, hands
Put up your hands, hands, hands, hands
Put up your hands, hands, hands, hands
So just put up your hands, hands, hands, hands
Put up your hands, hands, hands, hands
Put up your hands, hands, hands, hands
So just put up your hands
I get a lot of friends say, they got bad messages waiting
From you 
What am I supposed to do
I gotta say you're desperate
I don't like yourself abused
Saw you blowing a fuse
Work it out, work it out
You won't get nothing from me
Baby don't you see?
I'm now, what you know, what you know
There's no way in coming back
Baby don't look back, to me
Why don't you save yourself,
From all this trouble
And just put up your hands, hands, hands, hands
Put up your hands, hands, hands, hands
Put up your hands, hands, hands, hands
So just put up your hands, hands, hands, hands
Why don't you save yourself,
From all this trouble
And just put up your hands, hands, hands, hands
Put up your hands, hands, hands, hands
Put up your hands, hands, hands, hands
So just put up your hands, hands, hands, hands
Put up your hands, hands, hands, hands
Put up your hands, hands, hands, hands
So just put up your hands
Cause I think you lost the fight
No need to take a stand, just put up your hands
So baby even if you're right
You're still sinking in the quick sands
So just put up your hands
Why don't you save yourself,
From all this trouble
And just put up your hands, hands, hands, hands
Put up your hands, hands, hands, hands
Put up your hands, hands, hands, hands
So just put up your hands, hands, hands, hands
Why don't you save yourself,
From all this trouble
And just put up your hands, hands, hands, hands
Put up your hands, hands, hands, hands
Put up your hands, hands, hands, hands
So just put up your hands, hands, hands, hands
Put up your hands, hands, hands, hands
Put up your hands, hands, hands, hands
So just put up your hands.
