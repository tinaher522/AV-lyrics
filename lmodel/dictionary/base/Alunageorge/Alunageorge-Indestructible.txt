<song artist="Alunageorge" title="Indestructible">
I don't wanna break you down
By being indestructible
You better do something crazy to me
Made corruptible
Cause if I make it easy
I will never be myself
And I don't wanna break you down by being
Indestructible
Indestructible
I believe that fantasy
Is an enemy of reality
But I can't seem to stop dreaming
About wild things with you and me
But that's just not enough to show me
All I need to know before I ring a bell
I don't wanna break you down
By being indestructible
You better do something crazy to me
Made corruptible
Cause if I make it easy
I will never be myself
And I don't wanna break you down by being
Indestructible
Indestructible
You say I'm way too cold with you
But if I don't keep hold
I'm not extreme
And yet I'm told
As I hurry will unfold
This love isn't like a drive by
You can't just pick it up on the slide
You'd better step up and show me why
Show me why
I don't wanna break you down
By being indestructible
You better do something crazy to me
Made corruptible
Cause if I make it easy
I will never be myself
And I don't wanna break you down by being
Indestructible
Indestructible
Indestructible
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
