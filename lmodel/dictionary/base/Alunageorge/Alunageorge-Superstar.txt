<song artist="Alunageorge" title="Superstar">
Nobody gives a damn, nobody gives him credit where it's due
I'll be his number one fan, even if it makes me look a fool
And I could never ask for more
And I could never be unsure
Because when I'm sick and tired of life he's got the cure
He's a superstar, in his own home
He's a superstar, but he's unknown
He can do things you won't believe
And it comes to him so easily
He's a superstar, in his own home
Coming in late at night
Creep around hear the sound of my own breathing
Hanging in the streetlight
Taking in the smell that gives me that same feeling
I'm gonna make it right one day
I'm gonna win this fight some day
I'm gonna reach that height one day
I'll find a way to show some love to you, show some love
He's a superstar, in his own home
He's a superstar, but he's unknown
He can do things you won't believe
And it comes to him so easily
He's a superstar, in his own home
I don't want him to go through life like a low down soul who no one cares about
I don't want him to feel like no one sees that he makes everything else alright
Alright
He's a superstar, in his own home
He's a superstar, but he's unknown
He can do things you won't believe
And it comes to him so easily
He's a superstar, in his own home
