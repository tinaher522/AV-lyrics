Girlfriends got me at the fun
She's using all that tricks to get me in the lipstick on
Ain't looking on, there's no way out
Baby come on now is my should
I tell it straight today was my keep day,
I just want to stay home and find a way
Were all alone, chill on my own, in my head
Won't tell me you wanna be alone
Cause I don't believe,
Well I don't believe you,
No, no, no, don't think
I don't know just what you need
Just let me lead that, be what you need it
Please let me lead you out
No, no, no don't believe, ooh, ooh no,
Cause I don't believe you
Time run away feels like
The perfect way to sunny a rainy day
But I go and help my girlfriend,
Her boyfriends out tonight like a bad boy
She told me straight, today she don't wanna play
Just want to stay home and hide away
Be all alone; cry all alone in her bed
Won't tell me you wanna be alone
Cause I don't believe,
Well I don't believe you,
No, no, no, don't think
I don't know just what you need
Just let me lead that, be what you need it
Please let me lead you out
No, no, no don't believe,
Ooh, ooh no, cause I don't believe you
Sometimes I make mistakes you know I'll be your boo
We always make it fool
