<song artist="Alunageorge" title="Your_Drums,_Your_Love">
Your drums, we're drumming your drums
Your drums, we're drumming your drums
You can't say that I'm going nowhere
'Cause you don't know where I'm coming from
And you can't say that I'm going nowhere
When I have been trying to reach you for so long
Your drums, we're drumming your drums
Friends say I've got something wrong
'Cause I've been trying to reach you for so long
For so long, I've tried
To reach you, baby, don't you know that
I've been treading water for your love
Whether I sink or swim, it's you I'm thinking of
I've been treading water for your love
As my light grows dim maybe you're not strong enough boy
Your drums, we're drumming, your drums
Your drums, we're drumming, your drums
I can't say where I'm going, noway
This feeling goes on and on
I can't say that I'm going somewhere
But I've been failing to reach you for so long
For so long, I've tried
To reach you, baby, don't you know that
I've been treading water for your love
Whether I sink or swim, it's you I'm thinking of
I've been treading water for your love
As my light grows dim maybe you're not strong enough boy
Maybe all along
I've been holding on
To the promise that you need some time
Making everything into a story
Making sure I never get to feel happy
Taking everything you do my own way
Thinking that you're begging me please
I've been treading water for your love
Whether I sink or swim, it's you I'm thinking of
I've been treading water for your love
As my light grows dim maybe you're not strong enough boy
Your drums, we're drumming your drums
Your drums, we're drumming your drums
