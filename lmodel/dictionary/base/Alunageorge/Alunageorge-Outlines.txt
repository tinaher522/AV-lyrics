<song artist="Alunageorge" title="Outlines">
It's not like a deja vu and it's not an illusion
But sometimes I feel you through all the confusion
It doesn't always make me feel sad but it never really make me feel glad
Cause all the good time we had, could never be bad
Our friends don't ask anymore, but they think about it I'm sure
Now it's jut down to me
Is this paper all I got, all I've got to keep you with me?
Keep you from fading away?
Cause this paper is not enough, not enough to bring you to me
And nothing will take you away
And I can't help tracing these outlines of you
But is this paper all I got, all I got to keep you with me?
Keep you from fading away?
It's not just the quiet times, not just the end of the night
It can get me when I'm feeling fine, even when I'm feeling bright
It doesn't always come to me clear
It doesn't always make you feel near
Sometimes it gives me the fear that you were never here
Our friends don't ask anymore, but they think about it I'm sure
Now it's just down to me
Is this paper all I got, all I've got to keep you with me?
Keep you from fading away?
Cause this paper is not enough, not enough to bring you to me
And nothing will take you away
And I can't help tracing these outlines of you
But is this paper all I got, all I got to keep you with me?
Keep you from fading away?
Outlines of you
