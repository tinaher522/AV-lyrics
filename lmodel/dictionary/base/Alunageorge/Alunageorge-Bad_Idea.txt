<song artist="Alunageorge" title="Bad_Idea">
Pardon me, would you listen please
I'll keep this easy now, keep it tight
I'm gonna have to let you go
Cos you're dragging like deadwood
You didn't shut it when you knew you should
And baby it's a bad show
I'm gonna have to cut you loose
Cause your whining is no use
It's time to let it show
I'm gonna have to let you go
I know you get your kicks from your messy life
Don't follow me with your fuss and strife
You're a car crash waiting to happen
I'm putting on the brakes just to save myself
You're a bad idea that's gone out of fashion
I'm not even gonna put you to the back of the shelf
Keep giving me a new excuse
I'll start giving you real abuse
Just wanna be polite
Don't wanna start a fight
So I'm gonna get this right the first time
Baby you're bringing me down
Pushing my buttons with your big frown
The situation is over, don't look over your shoulder

I know you get your kicks from your messy life
Don't follow me with your fuss and strife
You're a car crash waiting to happen
I'm putting on the brakes just to save myself
You're a bad idea that's gone out of fashion
I'm not even gonna put you to the back of the shelf
Keep giving me a new excuse
I'll start giving you real abuse
Disappear
Bad Idea
We have found
Now I'm done
You're a car crash waiting to happen
I'm putting on the brakes just to save myself
You're a bad idea that's gone out of fashion
I'm not even gonna put you to the back of the shelf
Keep giving me a new excuse
I'll start giving you real abuse
