<song artist="Alunageorge" title="Just_A_Touch">
I'm not hard as a rock, I'm just not easy to break
But don't take it as an open invitation to try
Cuz I'm just hopin' this time that it's all in my mind
I won't find that there's anything to worry 'bout
I want you to be yourself, I love it when I see you having fun
I don't wanna be your shadow, sadness taken away the sun
And you can call me a fool, but I just wanna see my baby smile
I don't wanna kill the mood, I don't care if I'm in denial
It's just a touch, so baby I don't want to know
It's just too much, so baby you don't need to show
It's just a touch, been cool to be friends
So, till we meet next time, till we meet next time
You think I'm cold as ice, I'm just not easy to find
But don't turn me into someone who'll break down and cry
Let's get this thing on the line, keep it simple somehow
There's no need, for fixing what's not broken now
I want you to be yourself, I love it when I see you having fun
I don't wanna be your shadow, sadness taken away the sun
And you can call me a fool, but I just wanna see my baby smile
I don't wanna kill the mood, I don't care if I'm in denial
It's just a touch, so baby I don't want to know
It's just too much, so baby you don't need to show
It's just a touch, been cool to be friends
So, till we meet next time, till we meet next time
I know jealousy is wrong, but the feeling's too strong
And it takes me too long to believe it's not real
So if it's innocent, don't push me into it
Cuz I can't handle it, if you're only teasing
It's just a touch, so baby I don't want to know
It's just too much, so baby you don't need to show
It's just a touch, been cool to be friends
So, till we meet next time, till we meet next time
