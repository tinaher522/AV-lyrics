<song artist="Alunageorge" title="Diver">
I'll go when I want to
Don't be surprised when I race you
Cause I wait, and I look, then I run
Better not play if you think you're being done
I'll move, cause I like it
I won't be denied if it don't fit
Cause I feel, and I touch, and I live
Cause I feel, and I touch
So you got some premonition all about my ways
Think you know some, but you're no one
You're getting in may
Always looking over my shoulder
But you'll never see what I'm about until it's over
I'll go when I want to
Don't be surprised when I race you
Cause I wait, and I look, then I run
Better not play if you think you're being done
I'll move, cause I like it
I won't be denied if it don't fit
Cause I feel, and I touch, and I live
Cause I feel, and I touch
I wanna be a diver
Into the sea
The unknown world going over me
A dangerous world setting me free
I wanna be a climber with liquidity
The hardest wall hanging over me
The fear of the fall setting me free
I'll go when I want to
Don't be surprised when I race you
Cause I wait, and I look, then I run
Better not play if you think you're being done
I'll move, cause I like it
I won't be denied if it don't fit
Cause I feel, and I touch, and I live
Cause I feel, and I touch
