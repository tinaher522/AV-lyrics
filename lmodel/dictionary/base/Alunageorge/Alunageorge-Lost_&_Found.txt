<song artist="Alunageorge" title="Lost_&_Found">
When I'm falling, and I'm broken
You can do what you want with me
That was the other night
When I had no will to fight
Now I won't come quietly
Looking out for the easy picking
Looking out for the easy picking
Don't you wanna try for someone who gets the easy picking?
Don't you wanna try for someone who gets you working?
If all you wanted was a lost and found
Should have got me on the rebound
Should have got me on the rebound
Because now  my heart is beating over ground
Should have got me on the rebound
Should have got me on the rebound
If all you wanted was a broken toy
Then why you looking at me boy?
If all you wanted was a lost and found
Should have got me on the rebound
Should have got me on the rebound
You coulda had me when I had no love
You could've done me laid back buckle up
That was some other girl, didn't get no pearl of wisdom
Now I don't buckle down easily
Looking out for the easy picking
Looking out for the easy picking
Don't you wanna try for someone who gets you working?
Looking out for the easy picking
Looking out for the easy picking
Don't you wanna try for someone who gets you working?
If all you wanted was a lost and found
Should have got me on the rebound
Should have got me on the rebound
Because now  my heart is beating over ground
Should have got me on the rebound
Should have got me on the rebound
If all you wanted was a broken toy
Then why you looking at me boy?
If all you wanted was a lost and found
Should have got me on the rebound
Should have got me on the rebound
