<song artist="Marlon_Roudette" title="Come_Along">
Early morning flight out of Heathrow
People rush around me, I'm moving slow
Stories crossing, blurry thousand yard stare
Good to go now
Then I catch your gaze and I fall in
Falling all the way, now I'm walking
No idea what I'm gonna say to you
I just go now
Fly through the ocean, into the deep
I'm going under, go there with me
You ever wonder if faith is a leap?
We gonna fly, we gonna fly
So come along, come along, come along
Come along, come along, come along
Right now is just the right time
Fate throwing us a life line
So come along, come along, come along
Come along, come along, come along
Right now is just the right time
Fate throwing us a life line
We gonna go, gonna follow the light
We gonna go where the colors are bright
We gonna fly, we gonna fly
We gonna go, gonna follow the light
Sheesh, I'm crushing down and it's okay
Since he operate in a heightened state 
Suddenly there's no way to run to
Face to face now
I just hope you can hear my heart beat
I say come with me, you say what you mean
I'm a get a ticket right now if you
Good to go now
So come along, come along, come along
Come along, come along, come along
Right now is just the right time
Fate throwing us a life line
So come along, come along, come along
Come along, come along, come along
Right now is just the right time
Fate throwing us a life line
Right to the ocean, into the deep
I'm going under, go there with me
You ever wonder if faith is a leap
We gonna fly, we gonna fly
We gonna go, gonna follow the light
We gonna go where the colors are bright
We gonna fly, we gonna fly
We gonna, we gonna, we gonna fly
So come along, come along, come along
Come along, come along, come along
Right now is just the right time
Fate throwing us a life line
So come along, come along, come along
Come along, come along, come along
Right now is just the right time
Fate throwing us a life line
We gonna go, gonna follow the light
We gonna fly
We gonna go where the colors are bright
We gonna fly, we gonna fly
