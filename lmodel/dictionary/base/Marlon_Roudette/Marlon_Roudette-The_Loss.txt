<song artist="Marlon_Roudette" title="The_Loss">
These are the streets we paved,
This is the love I gave,
This is the life we made,
This is the loss I have to bear.
And after the morning breaks,
The sound the morning makes,
Is carrying our mistakes,
And the loss we have to bear.
'Cause she don't live 'round here no more
She don't live 'round here no more
Another lonely town,
This is the truth I found.
There's no one to keep me down
There's no one to keep me down
There's just a vacancy
Where she used to be
There's only you and me
And the loss we have to bear.
'Cause she don't live 'round here no more
She don't live 'round here no more
She don't live 'round here no more
She don't live 'round here no more
