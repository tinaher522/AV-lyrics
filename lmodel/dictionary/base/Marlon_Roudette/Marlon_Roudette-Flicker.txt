<song artist="Marlon_Roudette" title="Flicker">
When I saw you waving like you meant it
Tell me do I read it wrong?
It doesn't mean it's over, doesn't mean it's broken
I just need you to respond
So what's the matter? What the matter my love
Why do you saw
You know you could take us, you could take us, my love, almost everywhere
From a whisper to a scream
A flicker to flame
When I say your name, when I say your name, your name, your name
Live our life in phases, made this strangers and crazy
Tell me am I crazy then?
Cuz I receive the signals and constant information
It seems to me you're everywhere
So what the matter? What the matter my love
Why do you saw
You know you could take us, you could take us, my love, almost everywhere
From a whisper to a scream
A flicker to flame
When I say your name, when I say your name, your name, your name
Am I giving up all to you now?
You could feel the flame now?
And all I want is you to know
If you see me in a faded light
All that I could do is promise that I'm with you in different times
So what's the matter? What the matter my love
Why so you saw
You know you could take us, you could take us, my love, almost everywhere
From a whisper to a scream
A flicker to flame
When I say your name, when I say your name, your name, your name
From a whisper to a scream
A flicker to flame
When I say your name
