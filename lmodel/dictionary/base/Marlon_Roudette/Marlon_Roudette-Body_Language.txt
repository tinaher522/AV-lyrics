<song artist="Marlon_Roudette" title="Body_Language">
Like the way it hurts
You can seal my lips without a word
Maybe I could learn
I want you to take me to your world
 
And I can barely stand it
When you use your body language
Got me at a disadvantage
When you use your body language
 
Shadows dance around
I can feel us falling to the ground
Imprisoned by your touch
I don't ever need a way out
 
But I can barely stand it
When you use your body language
You got me at a disadvantage
When you use your body language
 
There can be no lies
When you're talking with your eyes
There will be no compromise
You know I'm all yours tonight
 
Like the way it hurts
You can seal my lips without a word
Maybe I can learn
I want you to take me to your world
 
I can barely stand it
When you use your body language
Got me at a disadvantage
When you use your body language
 
I can barely stand it
When you use your body language
You got me at a disadvantage
When you use your body language
