<song artist="Marlon_Roudette" title="Your_Only_Love">
Yesterday, I was your only love
Swept away out on a sea of us
It's killing me now, it's killing me now
That I found out about the other one,
Yesterday I was your only love
Never thought I'd be a boy again,
But here I am afraid of the dark.
I can't move, I can't see the end
Can't even take my jacket off
How this happened?
How did we live something so great and throw it away
Never thought I'd be a boy again!
Yesterday, I was your only love (your only love)
Swept away out on a sea of us
It's killing me now, it's killing me now
That I found out about the other one,
Yesterday, I was your only love!
Did you know I used to race myself?
Count the seconds till I got to your door.
And now it feels strange standing here,
As if I've never been here before!
How this happened?
How I let something so great just slip away
And turn me back into a boy again?
Yesterday, I was your only love (your only love)
Swept away out on a sea of us
It's killing me now, it's killing me now
That I found out about the other one,
Yesterday, I was your only love!
Everything I ever wanted,
I threw it out, lost it all
24 hours on, you're gone!
Everything I ever wanted,
I threw it out, lost it all
24 hours on, you're gone, you're gone!
Yesterday, I was your only love (your only love)
Swept away out on a sea of us
It's killing me now, it's killing me now
That I found out about the other one,
Yesterday, yesterday I, yesterday I was your only love!
Your only love, your only love!
It's killing me now, it's killing me now
Yesterday, yesterday I, yesterday I was your only love!
It's killing me now, it's killing me now
Yesterday, yesterday I, yesterday I was your only love!
