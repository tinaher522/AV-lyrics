<song artist="Marlon_Roudette" title="Hearts_Pull">
Our HEARTS PULL a one way
Your soul had to die to live
Our HEARTS PULL a one way
Your soul had to die to live
I know the very second the line was crossed
Said it for the record that all's not lost
But our HEARTS PULL a one way
Your soul had to die to live
We were the right ones
She had me so gone
Dead in these shivers, yeah
I believe that
Our HEARTS PULL a one way
Your soul had to die to live
Our HEARTS PULL a one way
Your soul had to die to live
I know the very second the line was crossed
Said it for the record that all's not lost
But our HEARTS PULL a one way
Your soul had to die to live
To live, to live, to live
To live, to live, to live
Nothing we could do, to preserve it
But I already knew it was worth it
What the time does?
It's gone when the love works
Our HEARTS PULL a one way
Your soul had to die to live
Our HEARTS PULL a one way
Your soul had to die to live
Our HEARTS PULL a one way
Your soul had to die to live
To live, to live, to live
Our HEARTS PULL a one way
Your soul had to die to live
To live, to live, to live
I know the very second the line was crossed
Said it for the record that all's not lost
But our HEARTS PULL a one way
Your soul had to die to live
To live, to live, to live
And we fought in, yeah we fought in
And we fought in till the end
And we fought in, yeah we fought in
And we fought in till the end
I pull my heart away
I pull my heart away
I pull my heart away
I pull my heart away
