<song artist="Marlon_Roudette" title="New_Age">
If love was a word
I don't understand
The simplest sound
With four letters
Whatever it was
I'm over it now
With every day
It gets better
It gets better
Are you loving pain, loving the pain?
And with every day, every day
I try to move on
Whatever it was
Whatever it was
There's nothing now
You changed
New Age
I'm walking away
From everything I had
I need a room
With new colours
There was a time
When I didn't mind
Living the life
Of others
Are you loving the pain, loving the pain?
And with every day, every day
I try to move on
Whatever it was
Whatever it was
There's nothing now
You changed
New Age
So much fire that it burned my wings
Her heat was amazing
Now I'm dreaming of the simple things
Old ways, erased
If love was a word
I don't understand
The simplest sound
Four letters
And are you loving the pain, you loving the pain? (yeah yay)
And with every day, with every day
I try (I try) to move on
Whatever it was
Whatever it was (ooh)
There's nothing now
You changed
New Age
Loving the pain, loving the pain? (hey)
And with every day, with every day
I try (I try) to move on
Whatever it was
Whatever it was (ooh)
There's nothing now
You changed
New Age
