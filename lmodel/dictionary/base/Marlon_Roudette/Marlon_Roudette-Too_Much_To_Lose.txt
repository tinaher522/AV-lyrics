<song artist="Marlon_Roudette" title="Too_Much_To_Lose">
Lying on your arm
Black purple sun
I close my eyes
And I can see the burning skies
And it's just like before
Inside my mind
I'd love to come back and show you
What you made me
How you turn this wreck less boy into a man
And I'd love to come back and show you
I've got too much to lose now
Too much to lose
I 've got too much to lose now
Too much to lose
How could I forget?
You got to the wind
I found my breath
No since the day I left
Cause you are the risk I just can't take
I'd love to come back and show you
What you made me
How you turn this wreck less boy into a man
And I'd love to come back and show you
I've got too much to lose now
Too much to lose
I 've got too much to lose now
Tell me when you come at my door
Too much, too much to lose
Tell me when you come at my door
I'd love to come back and show you
What you made me
How you turn this wreck less boy into a man
And I'd love to come back and show you
I've got too much to lose now
Too much to lose
I 've got too much to lose now
Too much to lose
I've got too much to lose now
Too much to lose
I've got too much to lose now
Too much to lose
I've got too much to lose now
Too much to lose
