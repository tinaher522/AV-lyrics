<song artist="Marlon_Roudette" title="Everybody_Feeling_Something">
Hey, now let me tell you something 
We got the place erupting 
We got the place erupting, hey, hey 
This is the mood we wanting
Everybody feeling something
We got the place erupting, erupting
Street light feeds my soul
Can't let go, feels like home
Feels like a melody that's tryina break out of me
Oh, oh, yeah, yeah
Smoke rise free mount high, we catch light
The sound feels right
Works like a remedy
I feel it healing me, yeah
And it's the only way I want
I'm always close, I'm never far
I wanna hear your every thought, oh I
You taught me how to love
Oh, you got me whole
Hey, now let me tell you something
We got the place erupting
We got the place erupting, hey, hey
This is the mood we wanting
Everybody feeling something
We got the place erupting, erupting
Street lights keep that glow
Kingston roads, are in my bones
I reach out in front of me
I say I don't wanna leave, no
Smoke rise free mount high, we catch light
The sound feels right
Works like a remedy
I feel it healing me, yeah
Hey, now let me tell you something
We got the place erupting
We got the place erupting, hey, hey
This is the mood we wanting
Everybody feeling something
We got the place erupting, erupting
And it's the only way I want
I'm always close, I'm never far
I wanna hear your every thought, oh I
You taught me how to love
Oh, you got me whole
I feel it healing me, I feel it healing me, yeah
I feel it healing me, I feel it healing me, yeah
Hey, now let me tell you something
We got the place erupting
We got the place erupting, hey, hey
This is the mood we wanting
Everybody feeling something
We got the place erupting, erupting
And it's the only way I want
I'm always close, I'm never far
I wanna hear your every thought, oh I
You taught me how to love
Oh, you got me whole
