<song artist="Marlon_Roudette" title="True_To_Yourself">
From the very first time I knew
You was trouble
What could I do?
With that look you gave me
Just like a book that saved me
Be, be, be, be, be true to yourself
My baby she loves me for sure
My baby she loves me
Be, be, be, be, be true to yourself
My baby she loves me for sure
My baby she loves me
From the very first time I saw
I wanted more
I was sure
You were the one I'd been waiting for
Be, be, be, be, be true to yourself
My baby she loves me for sure
My baby she loves me
When I think about our history
It's always been a mystery
As to why we feel the way we do
Be, be, be, be, be true to yourself
My baby she loves me for sure
My baby she loves me
Now you know that I'm prepared
After all we shared
Things that we declared
I know how much you care
And that we're both aware
Be, be, be, be, be true to yourself
My baby she loves me for sure
My baby she loves me
(Be true to yourself)
(Be true to yourself)
(Be true to yourself)
(Be true to yourself)
(Be true to yourself)
Be, be, be, be, be true to yourself
My baby she loves me for sure
My baby she loves me
Be, be, be, be, be true to yourself
My baby she loves me for sure
My baby she loves me
Be, be, be, be, be true to yourself
My baby she loves me for sure
My baby she loves me
Be, be, be, be, be true to yourself
My baby she loves me for sure
My baby she loves me
Be, be, be, be, be true to yourself
My baby she loves me for sure
My baby she loves me
