<song artist="Marlon_Roudette" title="Hold_On_Me">
Seems you gotta hold on me
Really got to hold on me
Just let me keep a piece of me
Go ahead, take the rest of me
You are my best friend
You are my worst of enemies
You are my lover
You brought me to my knees
And all this time both of us were wrong
but I just blamed myself
You break me down till I got nothing else
I can't lie to myself
Tell me are we only casualties spinning out of love
So no more, no more
Help me tear us from this tragedy
I don't wanna lose our love
So come on, come on
At time I start to wonder
I don't recognize my self
You compare me to the others
But I can't be nobody else
Seems you gotta hold on me
Really got to hold on me
Let me keep a piece of me
Go ahead take the rest of me
And all this time both of us were wrong
and I just blamed myself
You break me down till I got nothing else
I can't lie to myself
Tell me are we only casualties spinning out of love
So no more, no more
Help me tear us from this tragedy
I don't wanna lose our love
So come on, come on
Tell me are we only casualties spinning out of love
So no more, no more
Help me tear us from this tragedy
I don't wanna lose our love
So come on, come on
