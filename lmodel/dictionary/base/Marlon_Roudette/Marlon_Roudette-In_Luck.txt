<song artist="Marlon_Roudette" title="In_Luck">
You don't have to be strong
if you don't see the light
come on let me hold you
do you feel alright?
and I will stay with you
tonight
I never was a gambling man
until I lost a few
show me how to win him back
and here's my gratitude
and I will stay right here
with you
you're in luck
you're in luck
and you feel stuck
I help you up
I help you up
it's a little moment of greatness
in a life like this
don't it feel good to know
you're in luck
you don't have to pretend
when the ground is hard
I don't care who was there before
this is a changing of the guard
and I will see you through
it all
you're in luck
you're in luck
and you feel stuck
I help you up
I help you up
gone the days of all
you left in the cold
now every smile you show
it's a little moment of greatness
in a life like this
don't it feel good to know
you're in luck
and I don't want to breathe no more
to find your love is future
to find your love is future
and I don't want to leave no more
trying to take for you judge
trying to take for you judge
you're in luck
you're in luck
and you feel stuck
I help you up
I help you up
it's a little moment of greatness
in a life like this
don't it feel good to know
you're in luck
