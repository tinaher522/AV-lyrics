<song artist="Marlon_Roudette" title="Anti_Hero">
I am the first to
Recognize the virtue
In everything you are
In everything you try to be
You could risk it all
Fall in love with an outlaw
Can you play your part 
In this tragedy?
Face it you need to know
Faith is running low
Ain't no good to you
I'm your anti hero
The chances that I've blown
The love I could have known
Can't do this to you
And as we go
To this brave new world
Ain't no good to you
I'm your anti hero
And as we go
To this brave new world
Can't do this to you
You were the first to
Recognize and refer to
Everything I am 
Not just who I'm trying to be
Time'ss a critical
And I can leave you on no more
If I play a role
Then we're bound to fall
Face it you need to know
Faith is running low
Ain't no good to you
I'm your anti hero
The chances that I've blown
The love I could have known
Can't do this to you
And as we go
To this brave new world
Ain't no good to you
I'm your anti hero
And as we go
To this brave new world
Can't do this to you
I won't blame you
If you decide to run
After all I've done
There is no shame
If you've had enough
You decide if I'm the one
And as we go
To this brave new world
Ain't no good to you
I'm your anti hero
And as we go
To this brave new world
Can't do this to you
You decide if I 'm the one
