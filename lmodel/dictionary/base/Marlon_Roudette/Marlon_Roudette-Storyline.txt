<song artist="Marlon_Roudette" title="Storyline">
Don't fall to pieces babe
On this lonely stage
You're a character
Turned runaway
Don't fall to pieces babe
You know we're all the same
We want our problems solved
It's why we get involved
But I notice every time
I'm the fool you run to 
When the latest on the line
Ain't what it's cracked up to be
And I know what you're going to say
I know your storyline, storyline
Girl meets boy then she runs away
Across a boderline, borderline
And I know the role you want me to play
I'm the fool you run to
Cause every time you fall to pieces babe
It's the same old storyline (storyline, storyline)
The same old line
Your expectations babe
Are far too great
And a man I know who can bare the load
And every tragedy merely punctuates
Your happiness so I anticipate
But I notice every time
I'm the fool you run to 
When the latest on the line
Ain't what it's cracked up to be
And I know what you're going to say
I know your storyline, storyline
Girl meets boy then she runs away
Across a boderline, borderline
And I know the role you want me to play
I'm the fool you run to
Cause every time you fall to pieces babe
It's the same old storyline (storyline, storyline)
It's the same old storyline (storyline, storyline)
The same old line
(story, story, story, story)
(story, story, story, story)
And I know what you're going to say
I know your storyline, storyline
Girl meets boy then she runs away (runs away)
Across a boderline, borderline
And I know the role you want me to play
I'm the fool you run to
Cause every time you fall to pieces babe
It's the same old storyline
I know, story, used to love your stories
I know, story, used to love your stories
Oh not now
Tell me stories
But now, no not now
No, not now
No, not now
No, not now
