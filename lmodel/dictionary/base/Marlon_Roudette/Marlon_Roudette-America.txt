<song artist="Marlon_Roudette" title="America">
Small town got too small?
Saw you taking off
Drop dead beautiful,
Act like you didn't know
Sun a little brighter,
Friends a little higher
Did you lose your accent? Change your hair?
Life a little larger
Does everybody play a little harder?
Anybody tell you that you got it, got it, got it?
Did you make it in America?
Find yourself a fortune?
Santa Monica, turning up the volume
Did you make it in America?
Do they all adore you? 
From afar can you hear me cheering for you?
Go, go, go, go on!
Go, go, go, go on!
Is a big town big enough
For just a teenage crush?
Are you still wild at heart
Does the searching never stop?
Sun a little brighter
Friends a little higher
Did you lose your accent? Change your hair?
Life a little larger,
Does everybody play a little harder?
Anybody tell you that you got it, got it, got it?
Did you make it in America
Find yourself a fortune?
In Santa Monica, turning up the volume
Did you make it in America?
Do they all adore you? 
From afar can you hear me cheering for you?
Go, go, go, go on!
When I think about you, 'bout you
Nothing could've stopped you, stopped you
Go, go, go, go on!
When I think about you, 'bout you
Nothing could've stopped you, stopped you
Did you make it in America
Find yourself a fortune?
In Santa Monica, turning up the volume
Did you make it in America?
Do they all adore you? 
From afar can you hear me cheering for you?
Go, go, go, go on!
When I think about you, 'bout you
Nothing could have stopped you, stopped you
Go, go, go, go on!
When I think about you, 'bout you
Nothing could have stopped you, stopped you
