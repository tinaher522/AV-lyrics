<song artist="Marlon_Roudette" title="Three_Hearts">
Early break, early break
Early break, early break
Early break, early break
Early break, early break
Inside me is a battleground
But I don't want to turn around
And see a voice that doesn't fade
Words I'd had heard you say
I'll remember 'til the end of my days
There's a rumour going around
And I'll never live it down
It courses through my veins
Those mistakes I made
I'll remember 'til the end of my days
These three hearts, beat as one
They're joined together
These weak hearts, come undone
Just the same, down to the letter
It's funny how the little things
Finally break our brittle wings
And we'll come crashing down
Nothing can erase
This fall from grace
I'll remember 'til the end of my days
Early break, early break
Early break, early break
Everything is quiet now
Inside me there's a riot now
This bed becomes my cell
But I convince myself
The blame lies with everyone else
And we all understand
There are laws to the land
They decreed a faithful pay
And I'll remember 'til the end of my days
These three hearts, beat as one
They're joined together
These weak hearts, come undone
Just the same, down to the letter
It's funny how the little things
Finally break our brittle wings
And we'll come crashing down
Nothing can erase
This fall from grace
I'll remember 'til the end of my days
And we all understand
There are forces at hand
And they won't forget our ways
They'll remember 'til the end of our days
And we all understand
There are forces at hand
And they won't forget our ways
They'll remember 'til the end of our days
These three hearts, beat as one
They're joined together
These weak hearts, come undone
Just the same, down to the letter
It's funny how the little things
Finally break our brittle wings
And we'll come crashing down
Cause nothing can erase
His fall from grace
No, nothing can erase
His fall from grace
I'll remember 'til the end of my days
Early break
Early break
Early break
Early break
