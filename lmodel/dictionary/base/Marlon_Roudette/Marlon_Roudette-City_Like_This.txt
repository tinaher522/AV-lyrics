A city like this
Won't understand
Won't get to know you
Won't hold your hand
Where comfort is a subway car
Where voices are drowned
And warmth is the feeling
From steam underground
In a city like this
Where dreams are for real
And laid out before you
In concrete and steel
You talk to yourself
To make it alright
You do what you can
To get through the night
How could you know
Your life was leading
To a moment like this
How could you stop 
Your heart from breaking
In a city like this
In a city like this
Losing my faith losing my mind
Trying to keep up one street at a time
There's no way you'll ever find me here
A city like this
A city like this
Like any place I know
Can change in a minute
We pay as we go
We're measuring progress in profit and wealth
You thought you could own a piece for yourself
How could you know
Your life was leading
To a moment like this
How could you stop 
Your heart from breaking
In a city like this
In a city like this
Losing my faith losing my mind
Trying to keep up one street at a time
There's no way you'll ever find me here
A city like this
In a city like this
How could you know
Your life was leading
To a moment like this
How could you stop 
Your heart from breaking
In a city like this
In a city like this
Losing my faith losing my mind
Trying to keep up one street at a time
There's no way you'll ever find me here
A city like this
