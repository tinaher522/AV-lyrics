<song artist="Marlon_Roudette" title="Closer">
I can tell by the words
By the words that you write me
That it's been a while
Since you've thought about me
And I really don't mind
The way you pass your time
I, I just want you
As I seem to recall
You were the prom queen
Right there in front of me
And still out of my reach
Now after all these years
You thought about me
I, I just want you want you
Close
Wrapped around me
Is what I want the most
Now you've found me
I want you close
Closer now that I'm free
Closer now
Closer since the words you wrote
Well this is all new
Unknown territory
Something surreal and just a little bit scary
There's really no need
So let's take it slowly
I, I just want you
Do you know the way to love?
Given too much of?
Have you got it in you?
Is there any left for us?
Do you know the way to love?
I do, I do, I do and
I, I just want you
Close
Wrapped around me
Is what I want the most
Now you've found me
I want you close
Closer now that I'm free
Closer now
Closer since the words you wrote
Me wha something fi hold on you
Closer to me is where me want you
Is right over dey so where you gone to?
Let we move how we born to gal
Me wha something fi hold on you
Closer to me is where me want you
Is right over dey so where you gone to?
Let we move how we born to gal
Do you know the way to love?
Given too much of?
Have you got it in you?
Is there any left for us?
Do you know the way to love?
I do, I do, I do
I just want you
Closer, closer to love
Me wha something fi hold on you
Closer to me is where me want you
Is right over dey so where you gone to?
Let we move how we born to gal
Closer, closer to love
Close
Wrapped around me
Is what I want the most
Now you've found me
I want you close
Closer now that I'm free
Closer now
Closer since the words you wrote
