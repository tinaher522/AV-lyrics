<song artist="Marlon_Roudette" title="10_Million">
Like de whole world ah cry
Trouble cant ease me get no peace a mind
Can't please everybody at the same time
Me try fi breath but me only ever sigh
Like de whole world ah cry
Ten million lives
One lost in time
I'm barely breathing
They pass me by
Won't catch my eye
For ten million reasons
And I
Never wanna let you down
Though I go unnoticed
Are you going to leave me here?
Ten million different ways
To see a man erased, erased
Ten million different ways
To see a man erased, erased
Me try fi breath but me only ever sigh
Like de whole world ah cry
Trouble cant ease me get no peace a mind
Can't please everybody at the same time
Me try fi breath but me only ever sigh
Like de whole world ah cry
Trouble cant ease me get no peace a mind
Can't please everybody at the same time
Me try fi breath but me only ever sigh
Like de whole world ah cry
One gigant ride
Me trapped inside
while everyone's moving
Changing headlines
the passing of time
To me it's all the same thing
And I
I never seem to get close
Though I'm making progress
I can't believe you left me here
Ten million different ways
To see a man erased, erased
Me try fi breath but me only ever sigh
Like de whole world ah cry
Ten million different ways
To see a man erased, erased
Me try fi breath but me only ever sigh
Like de whole world ah cry
You, you took something from me
And now I'm just an outcast alone on the street
I'm where I can't be seen
Here as an outcast with no place to be
Ten million different ways
To see a man erased, erased
Me try fi breath but me only ever sigh
Like de whole world ah cry
Ten million different ways
To see a man erased, erased
Me try fi breath but me only ever sigh
Like de whole world ah cry
Ten million different ways
To see a man erased, erased
Me try fi breath but me only ever sigh
Like de whole world ah cry
Ten million different ways
To see a man erased, erased
Me try fi breath but me only ever sigh
Like de whole world ah cry
