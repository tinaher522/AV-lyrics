<song artist="Cody_Simpson" title="Standing_In_China">
Feels like I'm standing in China 
While you're in L.A
And I'm sending a sign up 
And hoping you stay
I know you
There's no need to put your walls up
I will never hurt you
It's true, I'm falling through
Don't hide it
I will not desert you
What would I do without you?
Do without you....
Feels like I'm standing in China
While you're in L.A
And I'm sending a sign up
And hoping you stay
Feels like I'm standing in China
So far away 
Come closer to me
Come closer to me
Cause this can work if you let it, work if you let it, oh oh
Cause this can work if you let it, work if you let it, oh oh
They say distance makes the heart grow fonder
But I don't think I can take it
You're right here
Lets not fear any longer
I believe we can make it 
What would I do without you?
Do without you....
Feels like I'm standing in China
While you're in L.A
And I'm sending a sign up
And hoping you stay
Feels like I'm standing in China
So far away 
Come closer to me
Come closer to me
Cause this can work if you let it, work if you let it, oh oh
Cause this can work if you let it, work if you let it, oh oh
Break down your wall
We can still have it all
Don't wanna fall apart
I know there's a way
To get you to stay......
Feels like I'm standing in China
While you're in L.A
And I'm sending a sign up
And hoping you stay
Feels like I'm standing in China
So far away 
Come closer to me
Come closer to me
Cause this can work if you let it, work if you let it, oh oh
Cause this can work if you let it, work if you let it, oh oh
Feels like I'm standing in China
While you're in L.A
And I'm sending a sign up
And hoping you stay
Feels like I'm standing in China
So far away 
Come closer to me
Come closer to me
Cause this can work if you let it, work if you let it, oh oh
Cause this can work if you let it, work if you let it, oh oh
Feels like I'm standing in China
