<song artist="Cody_Simpson" title="The_Reason">
Not an ocean, not a mountain, 
not an earthquake, and not a storm. 
I think it stopped me, from wanting to hold you and keep you warm. 
When I close my eyes I see your face 
Everytime your smile lights up the place 
Make me believe that love was real 
Imma tell you how I feel 
Throw myself in the ocean cuz I'm love sunk over you 
Sail my heart straight into you 
Cuz you're the reason I'm breathing 
Throw my love in the ocean 
Sail my heart straight into you 
And girl I'm love sunk over you 
Cuz you're the reason I'm breathing 
Oh oh oh eh eh 
When I close my eyes I see your face 
Everytime your smile lights up the place 
Make me believe that love was real 
Imma tell you how I feel 
Baby you should know how much I (think of you) 
How much I (dream of you) 
I need you, I need you 
Baby you should know how much I (think of you) 
How much I (dream of you) 
I need you 
Throw myself in the ocean cuz I'm love sunk over you 
Sail my heart straight into you 
Cuz you're the reason I'm breathing 
Throw my love in the ocean 
Sail my heart straight into you 
And girl I'm love sunk over you 
Cuz you're the reason I'm breathing 
Oh oh oh oooh oooh oh 
I'm jammin in your lovin girl never coming back to show you 
Oooh ooh oh oh 
Stay reality, Now please believe me, oh 
Throw myself in the ocean cuz I'm love sunk over you 
Sail my heart straight into you 
Cuz you're the reason I'm breathing 
Throw my love in the ocean 
Sail my heart straight into you 
And girl I'm love sunk over you 
Cuz you're the reason I'm breathing 
Oh oh oh eh eh eh eh
