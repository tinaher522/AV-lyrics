<song artist="Cody_Simpson" title="Summertime">
Top Back, Hands Up, Radio On
with my girlfriend, just us, they playing our song and yeah
Ain't nothing like a summertime ride
Ain't nothing like the summertime
I cant help but stare at her
Even when the other girls are passing by
She got my full attention
and I cant keep her of my mind
One look at you, thats when I knew
That nothing else matters
As the wind blows through her hair
She got me praying that summer never ends
Cuz summer loves just not enough for me
So lets make it last forever
Top Back, Hands Up, Radio On
with my girlfriend, just us, they playing our song and yeah
Ain't nothing like a summertime ride
Ain't nothing like the summertime
It's alright, all night, nothing feels wrong
Just hanging out, having fun, the party goes on and yeah
Ain't nothing like a summertime ride
Ain't nothing like the summertime
Theres a place I know about
and I think you and me should go
It can be our secret baby no one even has to know
And your eyes cant hide what you feel inside
Dont think the stars have ever shined so bright
I cant feel my heart beating stronger
Wish that we could stay a little longer
Cuz summer loves just not enough for me
So lets make it last forever
Top Back, Hands Up, Radio On
with my girlfriend, just us, they playing our song and yeah
Ain't nothing like a summertime ride
Ain't nothing like the summertime
It's alright, all night, nothing feels wrong
Just hanging out, having fun, the party goes on and yeah
Ain't nothing like a summertime ride
Ain't nothing like the summertime
