<song artist="Cody_Simpson" title="One">
I'm so much more than Cody Simpson
I gotta alot in me, gotta get it out
What have I gotta do to make you listen
So much more than just a sound (It's much more than just a sound)
Oh Oh Yeah,
This is exactly what I've been dreaming of
Oh Oh Yeah,
Can you believe in me, Seeing what I can see
All I need is One, One, One
All we need is One, One, One
All I need is One, One, One
All we need is One, One, One
It's my dream, my home, my life, my soul
My dance, my song, my love, lives on
I'm beginning to imagine (beginning to believe)
What am I really trying to say?
I want to change the world we live in
and make tomorrow a better day
I wanna feel the whole wide world just dancing to one rhythm
I wanna feel the whole wide world just singing to one song
All I need is One, One, One
All we need is One, One, One
All I need is One, One, One
All we need is One, One, One
It's my dream, my home, my life, my soul
My dance, my song, my love, lives on
If I could fit the world in my pocket
Take a hidden dream and unlock
We'd all be flyin' in one rocket
It's my dream and no one can stop it
All I need is One, One, One
All we need is One, One, One
All I need is One, One, One
All we need is One, One, One
It's my dream, my home, my life, my soul
My dance, my song, my love, lives on
(Can you hear it?) (Can you hear it?)
