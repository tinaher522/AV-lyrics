<song artist="Cody_Simpson" title="Livin'_Easy">
I'm usually a yes man, I always say yes man
Walking through the streets, through the trees, in a big black winter coat, woah
You'll find me at the bus stop or sitting at the coffee shop
Sipping on a caf√© au lait, or something that I can't pronounce, yeah
Cause you know I'm never in a rush
What I got is more than enough, oh
I like my living easy, I don't need much of anything
That real good feeling, the kind that makes you wanna sing
I don't mind being on my own, but I would love it if you came along
So we can live it easy, living easy, that real good feeling, living easy
I never say no man, I'm just another no man
Walking through the desert just for pleasure, never looking for a treasure chest
Where we gonna go man? I tell you I don't know man
But it you're looking for adventure, you can join me on my endless quest
Cause you know I'm never in a rush
I like my living easy, I don't need much of anything
That real good feeling, the kind that makes you wanna sing
I don't mind being on my own, but I would love it if you came along
So we can live it easy, living easy, that real good feeling, living easy
(Get down c'mon)
I like a little mahi-mahi on my taco on the weekend
I can hear them birds singing, I've been sleeping on the speakers
When I'm walking down the street in barefeet and concrete
Never thinking, just leaning on the truth behind a meaning
So easy, I don't need much of anything
That real good feeling, the kind that makes you wanna sing
I don't mind being on my own, but I would love it if you came along
So we can live it easy, living easy, that real good feeling, living easy
