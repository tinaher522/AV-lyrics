Shorty, who dat you think always missing you
I cannot get enough of kissing you
I dont cry, ok I shed a tear, or two
On the grind, yeah, but girl ain't no forgetting you, cuz
Every minute, every second, every hour of the day
Iyiyi
Every hour of the day
Iyiyi
Everytime that I'm away
Iyiyi
Missing You
Every moment that is stolen, it can never be replaced
Iyiyi
Even if it's for a day
Iyiyi
I'm a text you up to say
Iyiyi
Missing you
Oh baby whenever I'm gone, I'm wishing I was back home
I can feel your heart when we're apart
Girl I'm on my way, trust every word I say
I can't wait to see your face
And when I said goodbye, I saw the tears in your eyes as you started to cry
I took your hand, and promised I'll be right back
Girl I'm coming right back to see you smile
So girl, what I gotta do to make you see
I mean what I say to you
I'll send you a picture, let you know I miss ya
Girls send me a kiss, I cant wait to see ya
Every minute, every second, every hour of the day
Iyiyi
Every hour of the day
Iyiyi
Everytime that I'm away
Iyiyi
Missing You
Every moment that is stolen, it can never be replaced
Iyiyi
Even if it's for a day
Iyiyi
I'm a text you up to say
Iyiyi
Missing you
Remember when we first met, I had to tell you that
I couldnt live without your love
Baby I must confess, we were the perfect match
You we're a gift sent from above
When you're thinking about me, text 1-4-3
That means I love you girl
I'll be your everything, and all you need
Oh baby, let your heart take the lead
Ooh, so girl, what I gotta do to make you see
I mean what I say to you
I'll send you a picture, let you know I miss ya
Girl send me a kiss, I cant wait to see ya
Every minute, every second, every hour of the day
Iyiyi
Every hour of the day
Iyiyi
Everytime that I'm away
Iyiyi
Missing You
Every moment that is stolen, it can never be replaced
Iyiyi
Even if it's for a day
Iyiyi
I'm a text you up to say
Iyiyi
Missing you
Flo verse:
Lil mama, ain't nobody else, I need you girl
I got intentions just to please you girl
And I try, lady that's what you deserve
Superfly be more precious than a pearl
I can't lie, pictures in my living room
When I ride, dashboard, digital
To the sky, so thankful that youre in my world
Do or die, baby, I ain't kidding you
I don't wanna be your distant man
Tellin me I dont do enough for plans
I really cant afford to let it hit the fan
Girl, every minute I wanna hold your hand
Ain't no limit to the words I'm saying
I dont wanna rock with a brand new band
Just you, lil mama, that's grand
I've been all over the land, and
Every minute, every second, every hour of the day
Iyiyi
Every hour of the day
Iyiyi
Everytime that I'm away
Iyiyi
Missing You
Every moment that is stolen, it can never be replaced
Iyiyi
Even if it's for a day
Iyiyi
I'm a text you up to say
Iyiyi
Missing you
Oh, yeah
I'm missing you
