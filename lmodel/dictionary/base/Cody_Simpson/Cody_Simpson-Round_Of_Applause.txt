<song artist="Cody_Simpson" title="Round_Of_Applause">
I was going through my call log
The other day and all I saw was your name
I was thinking what I'm thinking
This girl got me feeling some kinda way
Cause baby I never thought I would be the one who's so caught up
But now I see, you differently, like maybe this is some kind of love ooohh
Giving me cute names, yeah like that, aye
If there call trouble, call her right back
Showing PDA in every way eh
I never pictured me doing this saying
Hey girl, I wanna give you a round of applause
You deserve a standing ovation
Cause you got me falling in love, with all the things you do
Hey girl I wanna give you a round of applause
You deserve a standing ovation
Cos you got me falling in love, and im your biggest fan, baby
I cant believe how, you got me open, that there's 25 hours in a day, 
Is it voodoo? that you use, thats got my tongue tied with no words to say
Cause lately, weve been spending time and baby i don't care
I don't, I don't 
I'm in to this, whatever this is, and I'm not tryin'a share, no no  
Giving me cute names, yeah like that, ayye
If there call trouble, call her right back
Showing PDA in every way eh
I never pictured me doing this saying
Hey girl I wanna give you a round of applause
You deserve a standing ovation
Cause you got me falling in love, with all the things you do baby
Hey girl I wanna give you a round of applause, 
You deserve a standing ovation
Cause you got me falling in love, 
And I'm your biggest fan, baby
I never thought this could be what its become
We're the young, and that it's turned into love 
And I can't go on without you
So here we are, on the brink
Be more than just a thing
Mommy's girl, and fall in love,
It's the story of us
Hey girl, I wanna give you a round of applause, 
You deserve a standing ovation
Cause you got me falling in love with all the things that you do
Hey girl, I wanna give you a round of applsuse,
You deserve a standing ovation, cause you got me falling in love, 
And I'm your biggest fan baby
Yeah, you got me falling in love
Clapping my hands oh, you got me falling in love
Clapping my hands, you got me falling in love
Clapping my hands oh
