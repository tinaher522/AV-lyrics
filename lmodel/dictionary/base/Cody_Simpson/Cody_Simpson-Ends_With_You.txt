<song artist="Cody_Simpson" title="Ends_With_You">
Are you trying to heal a broken heart
Operating in the dark
Let me be the light,
You need to get there (to get there)
I know one day the end will come
I am scared cause you're the one
don't you know my love ain't going nowhere (nowhere)
Cause it ends with you (with you)
Girl, it all ends with you (with you)
It started with I
Then the L
O-V-E came over me
And it ends with you (with you)
This love story ends with you
I know that he's been on your mind,
Moving on, it takes some time
Don't try to make it right, if it's wrong
If you open up your heart to me,
You see 'em real girl
1-4-3
Until then Ima write you this love song
Cause it ends with you (with you)
Girl it all ends with you (with you)
It started with I
Then the L
O-V-E came over me
And it ends with you (with you)
This love story ends with...
You could take your time girl, yeah
But you could never waste mine oh, no
I go through the most stress all week,
cause I know when
It's all said and done
It ends with you
Oohh, girl, whoa
it all ends with you (with you)
It started with I
Then the L
O-V-E came over me
And it ends with you (with you)
This love story ends with you
