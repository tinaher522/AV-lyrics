<song artist="Cody_Simpson" title="Surfboard">
She caught up in that new California love
I'm the kid from out of town, try to get me soak
I ask her how a nice meet
She says let's go for a night swim
And we know what she meant
So come on
Let the ocean takes us away
'Til we see the daylight
Come
And I know that it's getting later
But we wanna stay
She on my surfboard
She on my surfboard
She on my surfboard
She on my surfboard
Go ride it, surfboard
Surfboard
We woke on the beach down in Mexico
She asked me how we got here
And I don't know
We got back in the water
The waves were crashing on her
And you know How it goes
So come on
Let the ocean takes us away
'Til we see the daylight
Come
And I know that it's getting later
But we wanna stay
She on my surfboard
She on my surfboard
She on my surfboard
She on my surfboard
Go ride it, surfboard
Surfboard
Summer does
Then the summer does
She told 'em girl can't surf with us
Surf with us, can't surf with us
Salt on her skin
Left me wanting more on the shore
Love beach boys like 64, 64
Go ride On my
Surfboard
She on my surfboard
She on my surfboard
She on my surfboard
Go ride it, surfboard
Go ride it
Surfboard
Surfboard
