[Cody Simpson]
I can't believe I got a second chance at love
I can't believe we got a second chance at us
I can't believe I got a second chance at love
'Cause your making me the only one
Right from the start
I knew for sure
You'd be the one that my heart runs to, yeah
No matter what
Can't let you go  (nope)
Never gunna let go
I ain't gunna let go (no)
I could've been anywhere right now
But nowhere feels better than home
(yeah, yeah, yeah)
If you don't know you should know right now
That you're the only one that I want
(oh, oh, oh)
I can't believe I got a second chance at love
I can't believe we got a second chance at us
I can't believe I got a second chance at love
'Cause your making me the only one
(oh, oh, oh) Yeah, yeah
(oh, oh, oh) Yeah, yeah
(oh, oh, oh) Yeah, yeah, yeah
This one is cold
Don't need no coat
You warm me up when you shine my way
No need for sleep
Girl, you're in my dream
Don't wake me up from your love
(Don't wake me up from your love)
I could've been anywhere right now
But nowhere feels better than home
(yeah, yeah, yeah)
If you don't know you should know right now
That you're the only one that I want
(oh, oh, oh)
I can't believe I got a second chance at love
I can't believe we got a second chance at us
I can't believe I got a second chance at love
'Cause your making me the only one
(oh, oh, oh) Yeah, yeah
(oh, oh, oh) Yeah, yeah
(oh, oh, oh) Yeah, yeah, yeah

The said the doors were closing in
Grab the towel, throw them in
Let's try a second time
If it's wrong, we fit the crime
Now the doors are opening
Take my hand, let's try again
Yeah, we're born to fight
Welcome some soldiers in
[Cody Simpson]
I can't believe I got a second chance at love
I can't believe we got a second chance at us
I can't believe I got a second chance at love
'Cause your making me the only one
(oh, oh, oh) Yeah, yeah
(oh, oh, oh) Yeah, yeah
(oh, oh, oh) Yeah, yeah, yeah
