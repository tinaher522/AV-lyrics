<song artist="Cody_Simpson" title="Shine_Supernova">
Flying through the galaxy
With supernova energy
Under pressure
Together
We're so much better
So much better
You know
And if a shooting star would cross the sky tonight
We'd be super heros
Winning every fight
Side by side
We come alive
Standing on your shoulders I can touch the sky
Out of the darkness
Blazing
You finally made it
Burning bright as the sun expanding
Shine
Shine
Shine
Shine
Shine
Shine
She's like a supernova
Burns so amazing
We fly high and watch down
You make me
Shine
Shine
Shine
Shine
Shine
Shine
Together we shine
Force field made of you and me
Nothing can stop this energy
Together
Forver
We're so much better
So much better
You know
Breaking through reality
We're soaring to infinity
There's no matter
Wherever
We fly together
Defiying gravity
And if a shooting star would cross the sky tonight
We'd put in in the universe align
Side by side
We come alive
Standing on your shoulders I can touch the sky
Out of the darkness
Blazing
You finally made it
Burning bright as the sun expanding
Shine
Shine
Shine
Shine
Shine
Shine
She's like a supernova
Burns so amazing
We fly high and watch down
You make me
Shine
Shine
Shine
Together we shine
Together we shine
Shine
Shine
Shine
Together we shine
Together we shine
Supernova baby
Oh yeah
Together we shine
