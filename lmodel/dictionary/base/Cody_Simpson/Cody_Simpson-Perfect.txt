<song artist="Cody_Simpson" title="Perfect">
You're perfect
You're perfect girl
Oooh
You're my perfect girl
Here I am, 
Sitting outside your door
In the rain, 
In the pain it's worth it
You are my life
I won't lie
But I've never seen a girl so fine
Since I've been alive
You're perfect
I know it
You're perfect girl
I will do anything to be with you
There's nothing, in the world
To make me, give up girl
I will do anything to be with you
If that's what it takes, whatever it takes
I've got what it takes
I'll wait for you, 
To turn your head around
That's why we'll leave the ground, 
Tonight
We'll fly to the stars my sky, 
Now I wanna be by your side, till the end of my time
You're perfect
I know it
You're perfect girl
I will do anything to be with you
There's nothing, in the world
To make me, give up girl
I will do anything to be with you
If that's what it takes, whatever it takes
I've got what it takes
Don't take to long, 
To set me free yeah
Cause you hold the only key to me
And the chains around my heart, 
My heart, oh yeah
I will do anything to be with you
There's nothing, in the world
To make me, give up girl
I will do anything to be with you
If that's what it takes, whatever it takes
I've got what it takes
