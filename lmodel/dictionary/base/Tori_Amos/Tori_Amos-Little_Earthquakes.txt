<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Little_Earthquakes">
Yellow bird flying gets shot in the wing
Good year for hunters and Christmas parties
And I hate, and I hate, and I hate, and I hate elevator music
The way we fight, the way I'm left here silent
Oh these little earthquakes
Here we go again
Oh these little earthquakes
Doesn't take much to rip us into pieces
We danced in graveyards with vampires till dawn
We laughed in the faces of kings never afraid to burn
And I hate, and I hate, and I hate, and I hate disintegration
Watching us wither, black winged roses that safely changed their colour
Oh these little earthquakes
Here we go again
Oh these little earthquakes
Doesn't take much to rip us into pieces
Doesn't take much to rip us into pieces
I can't reach you
I can't reach you
I can't reach you
I can't reach you
Can't reach you
Give me life, give me pain
Give me myself again
Give me life, give me pain
Give me myself again
Give me life, give me pain
Give me myself again
Give me life, give me pain
Give me myself again
Give me life, give me pain
Give me myself again
Give me life, give me pain
Give me myself again
Give me life, give me pain
Give me myself again
Give me life, give me pain
Give me myself again
Oh these little earthquakes
Here we go again
Oh these little earthquakes
Doesn't take much to rip us into pieces
Doesn't take much to rip us into pieces
Doesn't take much to rip us into pieces
