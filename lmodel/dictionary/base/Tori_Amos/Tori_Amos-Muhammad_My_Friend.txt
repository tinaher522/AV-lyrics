<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Muhammad_My_Friend">
Muhammad my friend
It's time to tell the world
We both know it was a girl
Back in Bethlehem
And on that fateful day
When she was crucified
She wore Shiseido red
And we drank tea by her side
Sweet sweet sweet
You used to be so sweet to me well
Muhammad my friend
I'm getting very scared
Teach me how to love
My brothers who don't know the law
And what about the deal
On the flying trapeze
Got a peanut butter hand
But honey do drop in at the Dew Drop Inn
I said sweet sweet sweet
Between the boys and the bees
Sweet sweet sweet, sweet sweet yes
Between the boys and the bees
And Moses I know
I know you've seen fire
But you never seen fire
Until you've seen Pele blow
And I never seen light
But I sure have seen gold
And Gladys save a place for me on your grapevine
Till I get my own honey TV show
Ashre ashre ashre ashre
And if I lose my Cracker Jacks at the tidal wave
I got a place in the Pope's rubber robe
I said Muhammad my friend
It's time to tell the world
We both know it was a girl
Back in Bethlehem
We both know it was a girl
Back in Bethlehem
We both know it was a girl
Back in Bethlehem
