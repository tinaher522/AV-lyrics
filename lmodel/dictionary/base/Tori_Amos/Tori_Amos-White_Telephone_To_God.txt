<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="White_Telephone_To_God">
Do we have to get older?
We do
Do we have to get older?
We do
So besides getting grey hair
Guess what turned up in the mail?
My very own white telephone
My very own white telephone to God
When the white telephone rings
It’s him
It’s not happened to me yet
But it’s happened to my friend
Hearing from the other end
We all have to get older
It’s true
And then Saint Peter said
“Better older than dead”
So you’re being one to change your diet
Fresh bread, garlic butter
Toasted, dipped in the starter
Some days don’t you just need
Sticky toffee pudding plus
Extra caramel sauce for luck
Roasted taters and gravy
Pizza thin pepperoni
I’ll make a deal with you
Hold the booze and not tiramisu
You think you get tiramisu
Cheesecake, red velvet cupcakes
Some favour, their dream burger
Fish and chips with tartar sauce
Fear will come a weight gain, love
When the white telephone rings
It’s him
It’s not happened to me yet
But if I don’t change my diet
Hearing from the end
We all have to get older
We do
But then Saint Peter said
“Better older than dead”
“That’s your warning
From your white telephone”
My very own white telephone to God
