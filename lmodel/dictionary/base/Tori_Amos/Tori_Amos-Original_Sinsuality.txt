<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Original_Sinsuality">
There was a garden in the beginning
Before the fall, before Genesis
There was a tree there, a tree of knowledge
Sophia would insist, "You must eat of this."
Original sin? No, I don't think so
Original sinsuality
Original sin? No, it should be
Original sinsuality
Original sin? No, I don't think so
Original sinsuality
Yaldaboath Saklas
I'm calling you
Samael you are not alone
I say you are not alone
In your darkness you are not alone
Baby, you are not alone
