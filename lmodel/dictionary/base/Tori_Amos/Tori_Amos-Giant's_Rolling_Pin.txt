<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Giant's_Rolling_Pin">
Beth and Marlene's pies
With help from Caroline
After just one slice
You can uncover any lie
That's why the NSA
And now the FBI
Want to be the ones who control
Beth and Marlene's pies
With help from Caroline
So basically that's why
I'm off to find the giant's rolling pin
Legend says it does exist
If you don't stop looking for it
I'm off to find the giant's rolling pin
Legend says it will bake for the world
(Oh it will yes it really will)
In case we have
Rolled out our little world too flat
Then the giant's rolling pin
Will roll the truth out
So that the whole world can dig in
To Beth and Marlene's pies
Everybody spies
So why the big surprise?
That is why the working woman
Well deserves a slice
(Mississippi mud or Key lime?)
Now the nice taxman
In every state has tried
To say that it's in his jurisdiction to decide
Who gets a bit of pie
So honestly that's why
I'm off to find the giant's rolling pin
Legend says it does exist
If we don't stop looking for it
I'm off to find the giant's rolling pin
Legend says it will bake for the world
(Oh it will yes it really will)
If in fact we had
Rolled our little world too flat
Then the giant's rolling pin
Would roll the truth out
So that the whole world can dig in
The whole world can dig in
To Beth and Marlene's pies
With help from Caroline
For a window of time you can see through any lie
With help from Caroline
And the giant's rolling pin
