<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Suede">
Suede, suede, suede, suede
You always felt like suede
There are days I feel your twin
Peek-a-boo
Hiding underneath your skin
Jets are revving, yes
Revving from a central source
And this power over me
Not because you feel something
Or don't feel something for me
But because mass so big
It can swallow, swallow her whole star intact
Call me "evil"
Call me "tide is on your side"
Anything that you want
Anybody knows you can conjure anything
By the dark of the moon
Boy, and if you keep your silence silencer on
You'll talk yourself right into a job
Out of a hole
Into my bayou, into my, my bayou
Suede
I'm sure that you've been briefed
My absorption lines they are frayed
And I fear my fear is greater than my faith
But I walk the missionary way
You always felt like suede
There are days I am your twin
Peek-a-boo
Hiding underneath your skin
Jets are revving, yes, revving from an ether twist
Call me "evil"
Call me "tide is on your side"
Anything that you want
Anybody knows you can conjure anything
By the dark of the moon
Boy, and if you keep your silence silencer on
You'll talk yourself right into a job
Out of a hole
Into my bayou, into my, my bayou
Suede
Oh little sister I hope you didn't feel that way
And oh little sister I'm glad you came
And I said oh little sister I hoped you wouldn't feel that way
And oh little sister, oh again
And I said oh little sister I hope you didn't feel that way
And oh I'm still glad you came
I said oh little sister I wished you didn't feel that way
And oh little girl I'd do the same again
Said oh little sister I hoped you wouldn't feel that way
Oh I said I wished
Oh little sister you'll forgive me one day
You'll forgive me one day
Suede
