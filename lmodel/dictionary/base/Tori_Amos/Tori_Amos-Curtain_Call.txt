<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Curtain_Call">
Ebony beauty
Pass this shade
The looking glass reflects
Then a voice calls me back,
"This is just circumstance it is not
Personal", oh no it never is.
Then you ram your hand in your bag
For a little friendly substance
By the time you're 25
They will say, "you've gone and blown it".
By the time you're 35, I must confide,
You will have blown them all
Right on cue just act surprised
When they invite you to take
Your curtain call
You climbed China's wall
Your curtain call
I have done what I've done
And it has the ultimate consequence
Then a voice calls me back,
"This is not business, no,
It's more like spiritual"
Is that what it is?
Then you ram your hand in your bag
For a little protection
By the time you're 25
They will say, "you've gone and blown it."
By the time you're 35, I must confide,
You will have blown them all
Right on cue just act surprised
When they invite you to take
Your curtain call
You climbed China's wall
Your curtain call
They closed China's wall
Curtain call
Ebony beauty
Pass this shade
The looking glass reflects
