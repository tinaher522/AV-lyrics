<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Humpty_Dumpty">
Humpty Dumpty sat on the wall
Humpty Dumpty had a great big fall
And all the kings horses and all the kings men
Couldn't put Humpty together again
Humpty Dumpty and Betty Louise
Stole a sony and some Camembert cheese
And she said, "Humpty, baby, take me
Ooh yeah, take me to the river
'Cause I like the way it runs, yeah
Take me to the river
You know I like the way it runs, yeah"
He said, "Everything's going my way"
He said, "Maybe it's my la- lucky day"
And he said, "Anything you want I can give"
She said, "I want to take your picture just for me"
He said, "Anything"
She said, "Up there, baby
Get on the wall, babe"
Humpty Dumpty sat on the wall
And looked at her as he was falling
And all the kings horses and all the kings men
Couldn't put Humpty together again
Hey, Betty Louise, hey, Betty Louise
She said, "I like custard in the summer, honey"
Oh yeah, what it takes to be queen
Hey, what it takes to be queen
What it takes to be
