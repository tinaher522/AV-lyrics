<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Father_Lucifer">
Father Lucifer you never looked so sane
You always did prefer the drizzle to the rain
Tell me that you're still in love with that milkmaid
How's the Lizzies? How's your Jesus Christ been hanging?
Nothing's gonna stop me from floating
Nothing's gonna stop me from floating
He says he reckons I'm a watercolour stain
He says I run and then I run from him and then I run
He didn't see me watching from the aeroplane
He wiped a tear and then he threw away our apple seed
Nothing's gonna stop me from floating
Nothing's gonna stop me from floating
Can't go away
Every day is my wedding day
Though baby's still in his comatose state
I'll dye my own Easter eggs
Don't go yet just don't go
And Beenie lost the sunset but that's okay
Does Joe bring flowers to Marilyn's grave?
And girls that eat pizza
And never gain weight
And never gain weight
And never gain weight
Father Lucifer you never looked so sane
You always did prefer the drizzle to the rain
Tell me that you're still in love with that milkmaid
How's the Lizzies? How's your Jesus Christ been hanging?
