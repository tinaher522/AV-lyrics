<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Liquid_Diamonds">
Surrender then start your engines
You'll know quite soon what my mistake was
For those on horseback or dogsled
You turn on at the bend in the road
I hear she still grants forgiveness
Although I willingly forgot her
The offering is molasses
And you say
I guess I'm an underwater thing
So I guess I can't take it personally
I guess I'm an underwater thing
I'm liquid running
There's a sea secret in me
It's plain to see it is rising
But I must be flowing
Liquid diamonds
Liquid, liquid diamonds
Calling for my soul from the corners of the world
I know she's playing poker with the rest of the stragglers
Calling for my soul from the corners of the world
I know she's playing poker with the rest, the rest
And if your friends don't come back to you
And you know this is madness
A lilac mess in your prom dress
And you say
I guess I'm an underwater thing
So I guess I can't take it personally
I guess I'm an underwater thing
I'm liquid running
There's a sea secret in me
It's plain to see it is rising
But I must be flowing
Liquid diamonds
Liquid, liquid diamonds
I call, I go inside a shell
I see it's so and you're doing oh so well these days
You do it again and I say it's coming back again
Something like that
Saturday, such was it
Can he bring me those dreams?
Keep it back, daddy's down
Reaching back into himself
Keep it just between us
It's liquid, liquid, liquid
