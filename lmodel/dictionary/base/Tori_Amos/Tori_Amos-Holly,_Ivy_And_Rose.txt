<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Holly,_Ivy_And_Rose">
Lo! How a rose e’er blooming
From tender stem hath sprung
Of Jesse’s lineage coming
By ancient sibyls sung
A rose doth bear a flower
All in the cold midwinter
And at the midnight hour
And he waits for her to find
The heart she left behind
He prays she’ll find her way
To be his bride some day
Ivy
Of all the trees in the wood
Holly warms the rose
The holly and the ivy
When they are both full grown
Of all the trees in the wood
Holly bears the crown
The holly and the ivy
The running of the deer
For his rose to bloom
Holly waits every year
And he waits for her to find
The heart she left behind
He prays she’ll find her way
To be his bride some day
Ivy
Of all the trees in the wood
Holly warms the rose
The holly and the ivy
When they are both full grown
Of all the trees in the wood
Holly bears the crown
The holly and the ivy
The running of the deer
For his rose to bloom
Holly waits every year
For his rose to bloom
Holly waits every year
Waits every year
Lo! How a Rose e’er blooming
From tender stem hath sprung
The frozen air perfuming
That tiny bloom doth swell
It’s rays the night illuming
The darkness quite dispel
Oh flower beyond compare
Bloom in our hearts midwinter
Restore the springtime here
