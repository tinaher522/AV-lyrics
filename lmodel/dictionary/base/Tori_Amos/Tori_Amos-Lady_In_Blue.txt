<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Lady_In_Blue">
Cigarettes recommended
"Need a light to use?"
Said the lady in blue
After the rain
What is left? What is right?
"You may understand
I left the right man"
Said the lady in blue
"I left the right man"
Boys play well into midnight
"Can I join you?"
Said the lady in blue
After the rain
Pillow cold but she won't
Stray into other lands
He said, "Take my hand"
To the lady in blue
"You wronged the right man"
Cigarettes recommended
"Need a Light to use?"
Said the lady in blue
"I wronged the right man"
Boys play well into midnight
"Can I join you?"
Said the lady in blue
After the rain
Boys, you play well into midnight
"Can I join you?"
Said the lady in blue
Said the lady in blue
Said the lady in blue
"I can play too"
For you, I will play, lady in blue
For you, if you want me to I will play, lady in blue
For you, if you want me to
I will play, play for you, lady in blue
