<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Walk_To_Dublin_(Sucker_Reprise)">
If I walk to Dublin
Cause my feet are god are sore
But I’ll show them
I’ve got a girl in my pocket book and some proverbs
Going to take it take it there
Bulls and curdeling
And something’s happening
I’m property of my family
Gideon tell me where to go
I’m going to show, break down your father’s alter and moo
Do a jig, do a jig, do a jig
Do a jig, do a jig, do a jig
If I walk to Dublin
I’m gonna pass that turquoise lady in her new
Nike flats and something’s flat
I said I need size ten thousand for my ass, yes
Do a jig, do a jig, make them laugh
Do a Jig, do a jig, hey, make them laugh
'Cause he won’t be coming back
Said he won’t be coming back
If I make the golden hordes and the lord needs men
He needs good men
The lord he needs the U.S. Marines
I said I got them numbers in my sheep machine
I got me an electric sheep machine that
Do a jig, do a jig, do a jig
Let me plague myself with the west in his head
I said do a jig
Make them laugh
Make them laugh
Make them laugh
Just make them laugh
'Cause he won’t be coming back
'Cause he won’t be coming back
Said he won’t be coming back
The drinking test is puzzling, puz- pu- puzzling
The drinking test is puzzling, Marcel
For those that laughed are described both as drinking as a dog
Drinking as a dog face they say was misplaced
We wonder whether the lord chose a few good men
Whether the lord chose the U.S. Marines
