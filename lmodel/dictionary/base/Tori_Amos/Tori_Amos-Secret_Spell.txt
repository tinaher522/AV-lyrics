<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Secret_Spell">
In one hand dreams a plenty
In her smile a secret spell
There have been disappointments
These she knows all too well
But you losing you was not
A part of this plan
So jumps at three, tears at thirteen
Just turn you around for
Eighteen wheels in a high heel
Just turn you around
Sold a dream at twenty three
Turn you around
Hold out
You still got your secret spell
At the heart of the matter
Someone wove a secret spell
Mixed with girl not so peaceful
Angel and animal
But me losing you was not
A part of this plan
So jumps at three, tears at thirteen
Just turn you around for
Eighteen wheels in a high heel
Just turn you around
Sold a dream at twenty-three
Turn you around
Hold out
You still got your secret spell
A secret spell
Girl, you got to do a 180
Disappointment you know it well
But you losing you was not
A part of this plan
So jumps at three, tears at thirteen
Just turn you around for
Eighteen wheels in a high heel
Just turn you around
Sold a dream at twenty-three
Turn you around
Hold out
Hold out
You still got that secret spell
A secret spell
Girl, you got to do a 180
'Cause you still got your secret spell
