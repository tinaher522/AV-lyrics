<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Juárez">
Dropped off the edge again down in Juárez
"Don't even bat an eye if the eagle cries," the Rasta man says
Just 'cause the desert likes young girl's flesh and
No angel came
No angel came
I don't think you even know what you think you just said
So go on and spill your seed, shake your gun to the Rasta man's head
'Cause the desert she must be blessed and
No angel came
No angel came
Tonight
No angel came
There's a time to keep it up, a time to keep it in
The Indian is told the cowboy is his friend
A time to keep it up, boys, a time to keep it in
The Indian is told the cowboy is his friend
You know that I can breathe even when I cheat
I should, should, should, should, should, should've been over for me
Tonight
No angel came
No angel came
No angel came tonight
No angel came
No angel came
No angel came
No angel came
No angel came
