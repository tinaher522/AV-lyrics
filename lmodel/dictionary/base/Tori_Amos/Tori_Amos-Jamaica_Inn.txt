<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Jamaica_Inn">
Can you patch my jeans, Peggy Ann?
Just a little stitch to mend the hole
He has torn, if you can
Maybe I got too set in my ways
He says she reminds him of me
When we first met in those early day
The sexiest thing is trust
I wake up to find the pirates have come
Tying up along your coast
How was I to know the pirates have come?
Between Rebecca's
Beneath your firmaments
I have worshipped
In the Jamaica Inn
In the Jamaica Inn
With the gales my little boat was tossed
How was I to know that you'd sent her
With a lantern to bring me in
"Are you positive this is a friend?"
The captain grimaced, "Those are cliffs
Of rock ahead if I'm not mistaken"
The sexiest thing is trust
I wake up to find the pirates have come
Tying up along your coast
How was I to know the pirates have come?
Between Rebecca's
Beneath your firmaments
I have worshipped
The sexiest thing is trust
I wake up to find the pirates have come
Tying up along your coast
How was I to know the pirates have come?
Between Rebecca's
Beneath your firmaments
I have worshipped
In the Jamaica Inn
In the Jamaica Inn
In the Jamaica Inn
In the Jamaica Inn
