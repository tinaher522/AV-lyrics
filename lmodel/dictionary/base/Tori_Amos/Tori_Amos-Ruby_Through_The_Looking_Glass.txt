<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Ruby_Through_The_Looking_Glass">
Feel a little hand turning inside me
Don't you think she feels us fighting
Strike me at the root, I won't let you
Put her through what you put me through
When I said I wanted it all
Doesn't every woman want it all
Running through the house screaming
Girl unstrung, you could always play that one
Baptized of fire and every beat in the bar
Hymns for her, feel her kick me from the inside
When I said I wanted it all
Doesn't every woman want it all
As a man do you find
Doesn't every boy smoke to cry, cry
You could almost drown her waterfall
You could almost drown my waterfall
Through the looking glass Ruby sees
Things in you, things in me she won't want to be
Just a little light turning the key
At the root, what I missed she will carry
When I said I wanted it all
Doesn't every woman want it all
As a man do you find
Doesn't every boy smoke to cry, smoke to cry, smoke to cry
Feel a little hand
Turning
Turning
Ruby
