Leaving terra
Leaving terra
Leaving terra
If you're a thought
You will want me to think you and I did
Invited a guest
Up until you announced that you had moved in
"What do you plan to do with all your freedom?"
The new sheriff said, quite proud of his badge
"You must admit the land is now in good hands"
Yes, time will tell that you just lift your lamp
I will follow her on her path
Scarlet's walk through the violets
Just tell your gods for me
All debts are off this year
They're free to leave
Yes, they're free to leave
Leaving terra
Leaving terra
There was a time
When I thought that her destiny should've been mine
Big brave nation
But instead her medicine now forgotten
"What do you plan to do with all your stories"
The new sheriff said, quite proud of his badge
We'll weave them through every rocket's red glare
And huddled masses, you just lift your lamp
I will follow her on her path
Scarlet's walk through the violets
Just tell your gods for me
All debts are off this year
They're free to leave
Yes, they're free to leave
Leaving terra
Leaving terra
If you're a thought
You will want me to think you and I did
And I did
