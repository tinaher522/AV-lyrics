<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Sweet_Sangria">
I know you know every desperado and sharp shooter
In the West, you say that I can't see behind the mask
Of those who call themselves the good guys in this
Who take and take, "So are you with me or not," you say
"This time decide"
Balmy days, sweet sangria
She's been gone, have you seen her?
Señorita shyly turning away
Leaving me our fading flame
Yeah, you think about that
What you believe in, it matters now to you and me
What you believe in, I'm taking in, I said I'm taking in
What you believe in, it matters now to you and me
Before sundown the Mexicans leave San Antone
The car will then drop him at the border, the breaking point
I know your people have suffered time and time again
But what about, I ask you now, the innocents on both sides?
Balmy days, sweet sangria
She's been gone, have you seen her?
Señorita shyly turning away
Leaving me our fading flame
Yeah, you think about that
What you believe in, it matters now to you and me
What you believe in, 'cause I'm taking in, you say I'm taking in
What you believe in, it matters now to you and me
So give me, give me, give me a no window
I ask you give me, give me, give me a bloodless road
Tell me, tell me, tell me why does, does someone
Have to, have to, have to lose?
