<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Antoher_Girl's_Paradise">
You caught me lingering
In another girl's paradise
The way she paints the world --
I want that in my life emeralds,
You should know,
Are renting in her meadow
With a stroke beauty lives
How could I resist you are desire
When it all is said said and done
Who can love you and still be standing
There's Mary calling up a storm
Can I take from you and not keep taking
Naked as day Gemma follows him
Does it all come down
To the thing one girl fears in the night
Is another girl's paradise
Through twists and turns
Jasmine foxed me in her grove
Arms filled with honey-bells,
St Michael Sanford bloods
"You have come to discover what you want"
What I want is not to want what isn't mine
"But I am desire" when it all is said and done.
Is another girl
Is another girl
Is another girl's paradise
