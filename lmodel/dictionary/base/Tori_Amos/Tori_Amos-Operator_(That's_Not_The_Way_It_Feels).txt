Operator, well, could you help me place this call?
See the number on the matchbook is old and faded
She's living in L. A. with my best old ex-friend Ray
A guy she said she knew well and sometimes hated
Isn't that the way they say it goes?
Well, let's forget all that
And give me the number if you can find it
So I can call just to tell 'em I'm fine and to show
I've overcome the blow
I've learned to take it well
I only wish my words could just convince myself
That it just wasn't real but that's not the way it feels
Operator, well, could you help me place this call?
Well, I can't read the number that you just gave me
There's something in my eyes, you know it happens every time
I think about a love that I thought would save me
