<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Fire_On_The_Side">
Purple sunset, orange moon
I'm alone again without you
I knew someone had to lose
Kiss goodbye
Go back to your separate life
That you have with her
Ashes blow in the windy sky
Take my heart as you go
Baby it burns, baby it burns
Baby it burns to be your fire on the side
Taste my tears, see how they burn
Baby it burns to be your fire on the side
Purple sunset, orange moon
How can the music play
When the only band is made of gold
Wrapped around your hand
That I used to hold
Against my chest every night
But I still can hope
You will see I'm your home
Baby it burns, baby it burns
Baby it burns to be your fire on the side
Taste my tears, see how they burn
Baby it burns to be your fire on the side
Baby it burns to be your fire on the side
I knew someone had to lose
Kiss goodbye
Go back to your separate life
That you have with her
Take my heart as you go
Baby it burns, baby it burns
Baby it burns to be your fire on the side
Taste my tears, see how they burn
Baby it burns to be your fire on the side
Baby it burns, baby it burns
Baby it burns to be your fire on the side
Taste my tears, see how they burn
Baby it burns to be your fire on the side
Baby it burns to be your fire on the side
