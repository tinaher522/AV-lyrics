Then he said, "Mom I want to forna- I mean formulate
And discover the realms of the unknown with Mary Jane
After all you’ll be away for the weekend
Just please consent, I need a friend"
I admit your puberty was somewhat strange
Could this be fixed with Mary Jane?
Mary Jane, Mary Jane, Mary Jane who?
So I said, "Son, you want to permeate
And discover the realms of the unknown with Mary Jane
After all the other boys that are your age
They only wake to medicate
Do I know her family?
Is she even mannerly
When she’s out in society?"
She even bakes
She even bakes these odd brownies
Mary Jane, Mary Jane, Mary Jane who?
Then he said, "I believe in her family
On her maternal side there was a
Doctor Tetrahydrocannabinol Pure Isomer Dronabinol"
Mary Jane who?
Mary Jane who?
