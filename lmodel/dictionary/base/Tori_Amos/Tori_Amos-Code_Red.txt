<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Code_Red">
Some say that I will and some say I won't
Victory is an elusive whore
She is as easily mine as she is yours
Slip and slide my way through this charade
I know all the players and I must say
Do this long enough you get a taste for it
I'll do this last one and I'll grow me some wine
Leave them troubled boys all behind
What you stole I would have given freely
Code Red, you're staring 
Code Red, staring at me
Well, sometimes he do and sometimes he don't
Sometimes I love myself best alone
Do this long enough you get a taste for it
A six pack of Coke and a bottle of Jack
"Whatever you do," he said, "Look after that."
Being trusted and lusted, it could be worse than that
I'll do this last one and I'll grow me some wine
Leave them troubled boys all behind
What you stole I would have given freely
Code Red, staring
Code Red, staring
Code Red
Come on, baby, I can drink you down
Then I have my job to do and do well
Since you won't give guarantees I'll be cashing out
I'll do this last one and I'll grow me some wine
Leave them troubled boys all behind
I'll do this last one and I'll grow me some wine
Leave them troubled boys all behind
What you stole I would have given freely
Code Red
Code Red
Code Red, staring
