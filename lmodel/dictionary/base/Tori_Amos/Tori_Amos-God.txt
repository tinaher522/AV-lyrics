<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="God">
God, sometimes you just don't come through
God, sometimes you just don't come through
Do you need a woman to look after you?
God, sometimes you just don't come through
You make pretty daisies, pretty daisies, love
(Come down and tell me what you mean now)
I got to find, find, find what you're doing about things here
(Inside, inside, what you doing?)
A few witches burning, gets a little toasty
(Hey, what do you know? What do you know?)
I got to find, find, find why you always go when the wind blows
God, sometimes you just don't come through
God, sometimes you just don't come through, babe
Do you need a woman to look after you?
God, sometimes you just don't come through
Well, tell me you're crazy, maybe then I'll understand
(Come down and tell me what you mean now)
You got your nine iron in the back seat just in case
(Inside, inside, what you doing?)
Well, heard you've gone south, well, babe, you love your new four wheel
(Hey, what do you know? What do you know?)
I got to find, find, find why you always go when the wind blows
Give not thy strength unto women
Nor thy ways to that which destroyeth kings (Proverbs 31:3)
Will you even tell her if you decide to make the sky fall
Will you even tell her if you decide to make the sky 
God, sometimes you just don't come through 
God, sometimes you just don't come through, babe
Do you need a woman to look after you?
God, sometimes you just don't come through
Do you need a woman to look after you?
God, sometimes you just don't come through
