<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Fearlessness">
Fearlessness blew in with the wind
Waking up to greet the sun
We sailed on like the ancient ones
Into the nine underworlds
We knew dangers would come
I had faith in both of us
Listen to your heart, you can hear me
Listen to your heart, you can hear me
Day turned night when he questioned
"Why can't you balance the skies?"
Soulless storms have sent watchers
With blade-less weapons to fight
Teams of horses of the brine
Followed his cry through the fire
Demons of the wild hissed with the wind
Did you listen?
Listen to your heart, can you hear me?
Listen to your heart, can you hear me?
Fearlessness soon reminded me
"You must be stronger than they"
Cautioning, "There are those who live
To be cruel for the fun of it."
He let in a dark companion
That orbited between us
His siren friends convinced him that love
Was no match against storms to come
Their songs inflamed by doubt
Fearlessness drown them out
Teams of horses of the brine
followed his cry through the fire
Demons of the wild hissed with the wind
Did you listen?
Listen to your heart, can you hear me?
Listen to your heart, can you hear me?
Did we begin without knowing it
To find fault in every gift
Then that was when the blame began
What were once two forces joined
In fearlessness
