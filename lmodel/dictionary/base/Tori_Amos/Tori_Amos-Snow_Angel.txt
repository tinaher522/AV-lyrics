<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Snow_Angel">
As the bell brought in midwinter
I waited for a sign
A shadow of a wing
This has always been
The children know this
That she will come to them, to them, to them
Snow angel
Snow angel
Snow angel
She’ll make her way
And she’ll stay
For a time
For a time
In the dark of this midwinter
The moon slipped from night
A shadow of a wing
This has always been
The children know this
That she will come to them, to them, to them
Snow angel
Snow angel
Snow angel
She’ll make her way
And she’ll stay
For a time
For a time
The children know this
That she will come to them, to them, to them
Snow angel
Snow angel
Snow angel
She’ll make her way
And she’ll stay
For a time
And it's time
