<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Raspberry_Swirl">
Let's go
I am not your señorita
I am not from your tribe
In the garden, in the garden
I did no crime
I am not your señorita
I am not from your tribe
If you want inside her well
Boy, you better maker her raspberry swirl
Things are getting desperate
When all the boys can't be men
Everybody knows I'm her friend
Everybody knows I'm her man
Things are getting desperate
When all the boys can't be men
Everybody knows I'm her friend
Everybody knows I'm her man
Let's go
I am not your señorita
I do not aim so high
In my heart, in my heart
I did no crime
If you want inside her well
Boy you better make her raspberry swirl
Raspberry swirl
Let's go
Raspberry swirl
Things are getting desperate
When all the boys can't be men
Everybody knows I'm her friend
Everybody knows I'm her man
Things are getting desperate
When all the boys can't be men
Everybody knows I'm her friend
Everybody knows I'm her man
Things are getting desperate
When all the boys can't be men
Everybody knows I'm her friend
Everybody knows I'm her man
Raspberry swirl
Let's go
Raspberry swirl
Yes let's go
Raspberry swirl
Let's go
Raspberry swirl
Yes
And she swirls
And she swirls
And she swirls again
And she swirls
And she swirls
And she swirls again
And she swirls
And she swirls
And she swirls again
And she swirls
And she swirls
She swirls and she swirls
