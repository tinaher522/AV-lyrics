<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Starling">
Starling you were right, I am the jealous kind
Whoever would have guessed?
Starling now I am shut out and confined
Even within my nest
What, what does it take to make it through another day
If a feather lined with his words becomes a blade?
Starling when he screams, he screams in black and white
Just like the magpie
Shattered night then I woke, not to a lonely lark
But to a raven's cry
If a feather lined with his words becomes a blade
Then what, what will it take to make it through another day?
So when they play, play the song
Sing along
It could be your turn to shine
If you know the lines
Hey, what's that you say?
"You can find, find him online
Most of the time these days"
"Is that right?" I say
You were right Starling
