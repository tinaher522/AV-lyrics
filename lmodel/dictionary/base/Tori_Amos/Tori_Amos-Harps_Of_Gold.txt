<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Harps_Of_Gold">
I’ll show you how it’s done
You’ll smile through the pain
Sweetly singing
Over the plain
Gloria, Gloria
In Excelsis Deo
They’ll show us how it’s done
Out in the street
No, they don’t have much
Oh, but listen to them sing
Gloria, Gloria
In Excelsis Deo
Gloria, Gloria
Playing on their harps of gold
And the mountains in reply
Echo, echo, echo
And the mountains in reply
Echo, echo, echo
Gloria, Gloria
In Excelsis Deo
Gloria, Gloria
Playing on their harps of
Playing on their harps of gold
Over the plain
