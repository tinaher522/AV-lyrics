<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Little_Drummer_Boy">
come they told me
par-rum-pa-pum-pum
a newborn king to see
par-rum-pa-pum-pum
our finest gifts we bring
par-rum-pa-pum-pum
mmm, fit to give our king
par-rum-pa-pum-pum, rum-pa-pum-pum&gt;
oooh, yes...
so, to honor him
par-rum-pa-pum-pum
when we come
yea...
baby jesus
par-rum-pa-pum-pum
i am a poor boy too
par-rum-pa-pum-pum
i have no gift to bring
par-rum-pa-pum-pum
that's fit to give a king
par-rum-pa-pum-pum, rum-pa-pum-pum
oooh, yes...
shall i play for you
par-rum-pa-pum-pum
on my drum
yes...
mary nodded
par-rum-pa-pum-pum
the ox and lamb kept time
par-rum-pa-pum-pum
i played my drum for him
par-rum-pa-pum-pum
i played my best for him
par-rum-pa-pum-pum, rum-pa-pum-pum, rum-pa-pum-pum
then he smiled at me
par-rum-pa-pum-pum
me and my drum
yea...
me and my drum
