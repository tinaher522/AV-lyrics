<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Josephine">
Not tonight, Josephine
In an army's strength
Therein lies the denouement
From here you're haunting me
By the Seine, so beautiful
Only not to be of use
Impossible
I see balloons
So strange, victory
Twelve hundred spires
The only sound Moscow burning
Empty like the Tuileries
Like a dream, Vienna seems
Only not to be of use
Impossible
I see balloons
In the last extremity
To advance or not to advance
I hear you laughing
Even still you're calling me
Not tonight
Not tonight
Not tonight, Josephine
