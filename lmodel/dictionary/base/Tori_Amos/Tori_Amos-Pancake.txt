Here
Here
I'm not sure who's fooling who here
As I'm watching your decay
We both know you could deflate
A seven hurricane
Seems like you and your tribe
Decided you'd rewrite the law
Segregate the mind
From body, from soul
You give me yours, I'll give you mine
'Cause I can look your god right in the eye
You give me yours, I'll give you mine
You used to look my god right in the eye (here)
I believe in defending
In what we once stood for
It seems in vogue
To be a closet misogynist homophobe
A change of course in our direction
A dash of truth spread thinly
Like a flag on a pop star
On a Benzodiazapene
You give me yours, I'll give you mine
'Cause I can look your god right in the eye
You give me yours, I'll give you mine
You used to look my god right in the eye (here)
Oh Zion please remove your glove
And dispel every trace
Of his spoken word
That has lodged in my vortex
I'm not sure who's fooling who here
As I'm watching our decay
We both know you could deflate
A seven hurricane
You could have spared her, oh but no
Messiahs need people dying in their name
You could have spared her, oh but no
Messiahs need people dying in their name
You say, "I ordered you a pancake"
You say, "I ordered you a pancake"
