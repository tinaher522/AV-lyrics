<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Samurai">
My samurai said
I'm going to the sanctuary
I knew about my love, too
My samurai
Done making a liar
Liar of me when
To be happy
To be you
Ha ha ha
He says ha ha ha
And my samurai
Take me down to the
A yeah to sanctuary, where
And I'm free
Going to be
You know me
You know me
I said I'm going to be
Going to be
You know me
My samurai
Taking my face
And she's sticking it on a daisy
And you
We got to cut that one too
I get the Samurai book up and just read words
