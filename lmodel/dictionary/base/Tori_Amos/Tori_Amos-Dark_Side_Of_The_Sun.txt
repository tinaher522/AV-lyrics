<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Dark_Side_Of_The_Sun">
Is there a way out of this?
If there is I don't see it
Can Heaven and Hell coexist?
Not when both battle for dominance
Brush back my tears and he said
"Girl, we have to soldier on
Yes, girl, even when we don't feel strong"
So how many young men have to lay down
Their life and their love of their woman
For some sick promise of a heaven
Lies go back now to the garden
Even the four horses say all bets are off
We're on the dark side of the sun
We're on the dark side of the sun
We're on the dark side of the sun
The sun
Soon there'll be fast food on the moon
Painted in neon with For Sale signs up
You say, "I'm more afraid of what
Tomorrow could bring to us"
Brush back my tears and he said
"Girl, we have to soldier on
Yes, girl, even when we don't feel strong"
So how many young men have to lay down
Their life and their love of their woman
For some sick promise of a heaven?
Bushes burn there on the mountain
Abraham and Ishmael turn back the clock
We're on the dark side of the sun
We're on the dark side of the sun
We're on the dark side of the sun
Sun, sun, sun
Dark side of the sun
