<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Cloud_On_My_Tongue">
Someone's knocking on my kitchen door
Leave the wood outside, what
All the girls here are freezing cold
Leave me with your Borneo
I said I don't need much to keep me warm
And don't stop now what you're doing
What you're doing, my ugly one
Bring them all here
Hard to hide a, a hundred girls in your hair
It won't be fair
If I hate her
If I ate her
You can go now, you can go now
You're already in there
I'll be wearing your tattoo, yes
You're already in there
Got a cloud sleeping on my tongue
He goes then it goes
And kiss the violets as they're waking up
Leave me with your Borneo
I said leave me the way I was before but
You're already in there
I'll be wearing your tattoo, yes
I'm already in circles and circles and circles again
The girl's in circles and circles and circles again
The girl's in circles and circles and circles again
The girl's in circles and circles and circles again, well
Someone's knocking on my kitchen door
Leave the wood outside, what
All the girls here are freezing cold
You can go now, you can go now
You can go now, you can go now
You're already in there
I'll be wearing your tattoo
You're already in there
Thought I was over the bridge now
I'm over the bridge now
I'm already in circles and circles and circles again
The girl's in circles and circles
Got to stop spinning circles and circles and circles again
The girl's in circles and circles and circles again, well
Circles and circles and circles again
The girl's in circles and circles
Got to stop spinning circles and circles and circles again
The girl's in circles and circles and circles again, well
