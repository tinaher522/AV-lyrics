<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Sleeps_With_Butterflies">
Airplanes take you away again
Are you flying above where we live?
Then I look up a glare in my eyes
Are you having regrets about last night?
I'm not but I like rivers that rush in
So then I dove in
Is there trouble ahead for you the acrobat
I won't push you unless you have a net
You say the word you know I will find you
Or if you need some time I don't mind
I don't hold onto the tail of your kite
I'm not like the girls that you've known
But I believe I'm worth coming home to kiss away night
This girl only sleeps with butterflies
With butterflies
So go on and fly then, boy
Balloons look good from on the ground
I fear with pins and needles around
We may fall then stumble upon a carousel
It could take us anywhere
You say the word you know I will find you
Or if you need some time I don't mind
I won't hold onto the tail of your kite
I'm not like the girls that you've known
But I believe I'm worth coming home to kiss away night
This girl
This girl
You say the word you know I will find you
Or if you need some time I don't mind
I won't hold onto the tail of your kite
I'm not like the girls that you've known
But I believe I'm worth coming home to kiss away night
This girl only sleeps with butterflies
With butterflies
With butterflies
So go on and fly, boy
