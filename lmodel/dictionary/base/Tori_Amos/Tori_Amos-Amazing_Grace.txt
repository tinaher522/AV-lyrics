<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Amazing_Grace">
Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now I sure is found
Was blind but now I see
'Twas grace, mother, that taught my heart to fear
And grace my fears relieved
How precious did ever, yes, your grace, sweet grace appear
The hour I first believed
When we've been there ten thousand years
Bright shining, said as his sun
You say I know that grace, sweet grace has appeared
And now she'll bring me home
