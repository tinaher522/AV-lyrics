<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Virginia">
In the lush Virginia hills
They kept her as long as they could
'Cause they knew when the white brother found
White shell beads wrapped around her
Skin a life giving river
Her body open as will his hand
And with a "goodbye", there she goes
She may betray all that she loves
And even wait for their saviour to come
And in some things, maybe he'll be right
But as always, the thing that he loves he will change
From her sunrise to clockwise to soul trading
Still she'll lay down her body covering him all the same
So hundreds of years go by
(The red road carved up by Sharp Knife)
She's a girl out working her trade
And she loses a little each day
To ghetto pimps and presidents
Who try and arouse her turquoise serpents
She can't recall what they represent
And when you ask she won't know
She will betray all that she loves
And even wait for their saviour to come
And in some things maybe he'll be right
But as always the thing that he loves he will change
From her sunrise to clockwise to soul trading
Still she'll lay down her body covering him all the same
Oh Virginia
Do you remember?
You won't even you
Oh Virginia
When the land held your hand
You won't even you
When the Land held your hand
Oh Virginia
You won't even you
She will let you back in
Oh Virginia
Do you remember
oh Virginia
You can't remember your name
