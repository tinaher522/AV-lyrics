<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Miracle">
Okay what if I could hold on but then
Would nightmares turn back into dreams once again
Would Lady Luck say this game has no end
But dawn does not rise to darkness
Hold on, break your fall
I cry miracle, miracle
But she's run from all the judges in her favourite dress
I cry miracle, miracle
I could have used one today
No, miracle, miracle
God I hope she's not gone far
'Cause, boys, not many DJ's can make you a star
I look to the children, they shrug, "Don't ask us
Hope was yours to protect till we grow up"
I asked a cowboy "Can you save the day?"
He said, "If I had me a few Braves as I'm too late"
I cry miracle, miracle
But she's run from all the judges in her favourite dress
I cry miracle, miracle
I could have used one today
I cry miracle, miracle
But she's run from all the judges in her favourite dress
I cry miracle, miracle
I could have used one today
No, miracle, miracle
God I hope she's not gone far
'Cause, boys, not many DJ's can make, make, make you a star
I hear miracle
I hear miracle
I hear miracle
