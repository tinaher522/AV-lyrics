<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Sweet_The_Sting">
With a strut into the room
With his hat cocked sure defiantly
He said, "I, I have heard that you can play
The way I like it to be played."
I said, "I can play any way that you want
But first I want, I want to know"
Baby, is it sweet, sweet, sweet the sting?
Is it real? This infusion?
Can it heal where others before have failed?
If so, then somebody shake, shake, shake me sane
'Cause I am inching ever closer
To the tip of this scorpion's tail
He said, "I laid my weapons down
With my pistol fully loaded
A hunted man to my root
Will it end or begin in your cinnabar juice?"
Is it sweet, sweet, sweet your sting?
Is it real? Your infusion?
Can it heal where others before have failed?
If so, then somebody shake, shake, shake me sane
'Cause I am inching ever closer
To the tip of this scorpion's tail
Love, let me breathe, breathe you in
Melt the confusion
Until there is, there is union
Baby, is it sweet, sweet, sweet your sting?
Is it real? Your infusion?
Can it heal where others before have failed?
If so, then somebody shake, shake, shake me sane
'C-'cause I am inching ever closer
To the tip of this scorpion's tail
Baby, is it sweet?
Baby, is it sweet?
Baby, is it sweet?
