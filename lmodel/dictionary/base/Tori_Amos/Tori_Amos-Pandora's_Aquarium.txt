Pandora
Pandora's aquarium
She dives for shells
With her nautical nuns
And thoughts you thought
You'd never tell
Pandora
Pandora's aquarium
She dives for shells
With her nautical nuns
And thoughts you thought
You'd never tell
I am not asking you to believe in me
Boy I think you're confused I'm not Persephone
Foam can be dangerous with tape across my mouth
These things you do I never asked you how
Line me up in single file
With all your grievances
Stare but I can taste
You're still alive below the waste
Ripples come and ripples go
And ripple back to me back to me
Pandora
Pandora's aquarium
She dives for shells
With her nautical nuns
And thoughts you thought
You'd never tell
Line me up in single file
With all your grievances
Stare but I can taste
You're still alive below the waste
Ripples come and ripples go
And ripple back to me, back to me
I am not asking you to believe in me
Boy I think you're confused, I'm not Persephone
She's in New York somewhere checking her accounts
The lord of the flies was diagnosed as sound
Pandora
