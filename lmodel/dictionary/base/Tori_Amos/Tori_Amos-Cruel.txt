<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Cruel">
So don't give me respect
Don't give me a piece of your preciousness
Flaunt all she's got in our old neighborhood
I'm sure she'll make a few friends
Even the rain bows down
Let us pray as you cock, cock, cock your mane
No cigarettes only, peeled havanas for you
I can be cruel, I don't know why
Why can't my bal-loo-loon stay up in a perfectly windy sky?
I can be cruel, I don't know why
I don't know why
Dance with the Sufis
Celebrate your top ten in the charts of pain
Ah, lover, brother, bogenvillia
My vine twists around your need
Even the rain is sharp like today
As you sh- sh- shock me sane
No cigarettes only, peeled havanas for you
I can be cruel, I don't know why
Why can't my bal-loo-loon stay up in a perfectly windy sky?
I can be cruel, I don't know why
I don't know why
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
I can be cruel, I don't know why
Why can't my bal-loo-loon stay up in a perfectly windy sky?
I can be cruel, I don't know why
I don't know why, why, why
