<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Goodbye_Pisces">
I don't, I don't know why
In your boys life you become like a bull
Like a bull in a china shop
Smash it up into smithereens
There you, there you go again
Breaking, breaking porcelain
Is that all I am, just a doll you
Got used to
We've done, we've done this before
As Mars sauntered through his door
Don't say it's time to say
Goodbye to Pisces
Goodbye to Pisces
I cried and I washed my tears
That turned into diamond
Ice into ice and if it could freeze
My heart wouldn't float away
There we, there we go again
Breaking, breaking porcelain
Is that all we are, just some dolls
You got used to
We've done, we've done this before
As Mars sauntered through his door
Don't say it's time to say
Goodbye to Pisces
Goodbye to Pisces
So how, how will I go
Back on, back on the shelf
With a smile, with a smile to the customer
And say on sale by the owner
Here I, here I go again
Breaking, breaking porcelain
Is that all I am, just a doll
You got used to
We've done, we've done this before
As Mars sauntered through his door
Don't say it's time to say
Goodbye to Pisces
Goodbye to Pisces
Goodbye, my Pisces
