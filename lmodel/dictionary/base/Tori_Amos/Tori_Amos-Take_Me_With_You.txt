<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Take_Me_With_You">
In and out on this same path that I've followed for years
Can't I look around and ask how could we still end out up here?
I can't just hold tight, wait for them to cut us to ribbons
If the sharpest thing where you come is a blade of grass
Oh take me with you, I don't need shoes to follow
Bare feet are running with you, somewhere a rainbow ends, my dear
These injuries, don't you think we need a new referee?
I can't let the ball drop, boy, I need some interference to shut them up
Oh take me with you, I don't need shoes to follow
Bare feet are running with you, somewhere the rainbow ends, my dear
Oh take me with you, chase rabbits into their burrow
Bare feet are running with you, today even the rain can cut me up
Tears turn to steel
And the wound never heals
In the darkness of November
Well, the witch is in the tower
And the snake's in the bower
And the hunt goes on forever
Now the stake is there to burn
My father's robe is torn
Between cross and mother
With the blood on your hands
Come on, what you doing?
I am fed up with this questioning
Here
Oh take me with you, I don't need shoes to follow
Bare feet are running with you, somewhere the rainbow ends, my dear
Oh take me with you, chase rabbits into their burrow
Bare feet are running with you, today, today
Oh take me with you, I don't need shoes to follow
Bare feet are running with you, today even the rain
Even the rain
Even the rain
Can cut me up
Take me with you
Take me with you
