<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Cactus_Practice">
Maybe he and I
Are like a pair of suns that are captured
Maybe he and I are like a pair of suns that are captured
Eternally linked into chasing each other's spin
Eternally linked into chasing each other's spin
Bound by beliefs that have become steel cords
Why the disharmony? Let's re-sing my world
With a harmonic defiance I'll face this
I'd like to induct you into the drink of the cactus practice, cactus
Cactus?
Practice
Will you induct me into the drink of the cactus practice, cactus?
Cactus
Practice
Are you saying I'm
Reactive but I can work with it, dollface
Every couple has their version of what they call the truth
Every couple has their version of what they call the truth
Call all that lies beneath both stories
Back to my fire
Embrace what you find
With a harmonic defiance I'll face this
It's time to induct you into the drink of the cactus practice
Cactus?
Cactus
Practice
I'd like to induct you into the drink of the cactus practice
Cactus?
Cactus
Practice
Will you induct me into the drink of the cactus practice
Cactus?
Cactus
