<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Forest_Of_Glass">
Steal me away
Steal
Steal me away
From where I stand
Although I'm kneeling down
On the ground
The owl hoots
The moon beats through
A doubt awakes
A voice dares to ask
"Will you follow
If you love him you will follow
Will you follow
If you love him you will follow
If you love him will you follow
Him even to
His forest of glass"
Robbing the Muse
Is that
Is that what I've done
They turn and laugh
"That you cannot do
We are the robin's muse
And we will sing for you
Lift up your head
Lift up your heart
Lift up your head
Lift up your heart"
In his forest of glass
