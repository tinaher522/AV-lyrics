<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="She's_Your_Cocaine">
She's your cocaine
She's got you shaving your legs
You can suck anything
But you know you want to be me
Said put on your makeup boy
You're your favourite stranger
And we all like to watch
So shimmy once and do it again
Bring your sister
Bring your sister if you can't handle it
Bring your sister
Bring your sister if you can't handle it
She says you control it
Then she says you don't control it
Then she says you're controlling
The way she makes you crawl
Yes she's your cocaine
Your exodus laughing
And she knows what you are
So shimmy once and do it again
Bring your sister
Bring your sister if you can't handle it
Bring your sister
Bring your sister if you can't handle it
If you want me to
Boy I could lie to you
You don't need one of these
To let me inside of you
And is it true that devils end up like you
Something safe for the picture frame
And is it true that devils end up like you
So tied up you don't know how she came
I said she's your cocaine
She's got you shaving your legs
She got you liking mine back
Got me taking it in
Getting mine back
Lasting mine evil
I'm taking my easel
And I'm writing good checks
You sign "Prince Of Darkness"
Try "Squire Of Dimness"
Please don't help me with this
Please don't help me with this
Please don't help me with this
Cut it again
