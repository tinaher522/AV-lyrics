<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Thank_You">
If the sun refused to shine
I would still be loving you
If mountains crumble to the sea
There would still be you and me
Kind woman, I give you my all
Kind woman, nothing more
Little drops of rain whisper on the plains
Tears have run thrust in the days gone by
If my love is strong, here there is no wrong
Together we shall go until we die
My, my
Inspiration is what you are to me
Inspiration, love to see
If the sun refused to shine
I would still be loving you
If mountains crumble to the sea
There will still be you, you and me
