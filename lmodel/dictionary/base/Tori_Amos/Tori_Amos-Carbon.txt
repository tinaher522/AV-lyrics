<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Carbon">
Carbon-made found her at the end of a chain
"Time to race," she said. "Race the downhill."
Behind crystalline irises loons can dive
Where the world bleeds white
Just keep your eyes on her
Keep, don't look away
Keep your eyes on
Her horizon
Bear Claw, Free Fall, A Gunner's View
Black and blue shred in ribbons of lithium
Blow by blow her mind cut in sheets
Layers deep now unravelling
Just keep your eyes on her
Keep, don't look away
Keep your eyes on
Her horizon
Get me Neil on the line
No, I can't hold
Have him read "Snow Glass Apples"
Where nothing is what it seems
"Little Sis, you must crack this."
He says to me
"You must go in again
Carbon-made only wants to be unmade."
Blade to ice, it's double diamond time
And keep your eyes on her
Keep, don't look away
Keep your eyes on her horizon
On her eyes
On her horizon
