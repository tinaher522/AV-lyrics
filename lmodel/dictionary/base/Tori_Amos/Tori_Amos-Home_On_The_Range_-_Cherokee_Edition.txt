<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Home_On_The_Range_-_Cherokee_Edition">
Oh, give me a home where the buffalo roam
Where the deer and the antelope play
Where seldom is heard a discouraging word
And the skies are not cloudy all day
Home, home on the range
Where the deer and the antelope play
Where seldom is heard a discouraging word
And the skies are not cloudy all day
Well, Jackson made deals, a thief down to his heels
Hello long trail of tears
The smokies could hide a Cherokee bride
Her brave was shot yesterday
Home, home on the range
Where the deer and the antelope play
Where seldom is heard a discouraging word
And the skies are not cloudy all day
We know it's not Caroline
Your home is your home
The range may be fine for some
But not in my eyes
Home, home on the range
The smokies always hide a
Cherokee bride, but in her eyes
We know it's not Caroline
Yes, yes, America, hey, ah, America
Oh, who discovered your ass
The white man came, "This land is my land
This is your land," they sang
Home, home on the range
Where the deer and the antelope play
Where seldom is heard a discouraging word
And the skies are not cloudy all day
And the skies are not cloudy all day
And the skies are not cloudy all day
