Shock
Got the shock of my life
Just buckle up girls
I'm stealing the night
From them
Steal the night
What they're down to
Let's see in cold day light
I gotta get this right
I gotta get this right
Cause she's up
And I am low
Watching you
Watching her play this game
Yeah she's bold
Bold enough
To set fire to your plain
Her fire to your plain
Pray
You can pray to your Jane
I put out the call
But not to be saved
Called my Deviline kin
With her yellow Astin Martin
"We gotta get this right"
I gotta get this right
Cause she's up
And I am low
Watching him
Watching her play this game
Yeah she's bold
Bold enough
To set fire to his plain
She said, "Get in and set the SAT-NAV to hell"
Or would it be Purgatory?
I gotta get this right
I gotta get this right
Cause she's up
And I am low
Watching you
Watching her play this game
Yeah she's bold
Bold enough
To set fire to your plain
Her fire to your plain
Her fire
Bold enough
Her fire to your plain
