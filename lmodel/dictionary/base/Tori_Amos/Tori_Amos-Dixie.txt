<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Dixie">
Grab your coat
And those things
Without any fingers
The peach ones
That keeps you warm
In the southern winter
Off I go, window shopping with my mum
We’ll go whistling Dixie down the lane
So who cares our purse is almost empty
I’m the richest girl in Dixie land
Look away
Look again
She is still
Holding my hand
Holding my hand
Grab your coat
The cloudy blue one
With the stripy buttons
That keeps you warm
In the southern winter
Off I go, window shopping with my mum
We’ll go whistling Dixie down the lane
So who cares our purse is almost empty
I’m the richest girl in Dixie land
Look away
Look again
She is still
Holding my hand
Holding my hand
Look away
Look again
She is still
Holding my hand
Holding my hand
