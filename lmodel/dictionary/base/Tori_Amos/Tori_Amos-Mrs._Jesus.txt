<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Mrs._Jesus">
Life lines and suicide crimes, he found me in a state
Grabbed my purse and hitched a ride with a Mrs. Jesus
"How you been?" I've been cruising a good invention
But in some ways I don't think it, it gets any easier
Your walking on the water bit by far my favourite one
But now it seems we're drowning in a drop of water love
And even as I'm climbing up the stairs
I know there's heaven there
And then the empty arms
That comes with the morning star
Well, made my bed of cut roses by understanding
That the cause, it just comes first with my Mrs. Jesus
The Gospel changes meaning if you follow John or Paul
And could you ever let it be the Mary of it all
And even as I'm climbing up the stairs
I know there's heaven there
And then the empty arms
That comes with the morning star
Well, life lines and suicide crimes, there's something every day
And there's someone always paging my Mrs. Jesus
Your walking on the water bit by far my favourite one
But now it seems we're drowning in a drop of water love
And even as I'm climbing up the stairs
I know there's heaven there
And then the empty arms
That comes with the morning star
So if you get the Jones at the crossroads, the personals are great
If you're my way let me love you Mrs. Jesus
