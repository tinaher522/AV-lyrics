<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="16_Shades_Of_Blue">
Are you telling me it's over disintegrating lost
And there's nothing I can do
Before you drop another verbal bomb,
Can I arm myself
With Cezanne's 16 shades of blue
As my heart is slowly ripping into pieces
Disconnecting from the circuits of my mind
"You'll get over it" you say "in time"
In time?
If the clocks are black absorbing everything but
A remembering how we made it that
Clocks are black
You say "Get over it if 50 is the new black,
Hooray this could be your lucky day"
But my cables they are surging almost
Over loading as you disengage
Could your heart be slowly ripping into pieces
Disconnecting from the circuits of your mind
"We'll get over it" you say "in time"
In time?
If the clocks are black absorbing everything but
A remembering how we made it that
Clocks are black
"That's it you're done.
You've screwed up your life"
Before you've begun
There are those who say
I am now too old to play
See over there at 33 she fears she'll lose her job
Because they hear the ticking of her clock
At only 15 I said 15, they say her future's bleak
She should have started this at 3
As her heart is slowly ripping into pieces
Disconnecting from the circuits of her mind
"She'll get over it" you say "in time"
In time? Stop Father Time
If the clocks are black absorbing everything but
A remembering how we made it that
How our clocks are black
Before you drop another verbal bomb
Can I arm myself
With Cezanne's 16 shades of blueâ€¨
