<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Baltimore">
It's so nice to live here
I'm glad this is my home
I've got a homestead on Baltimore Street
It's some place to call my own
It's all kinds of people
Familiar places, smiling faces
I'm proud to say I'm a Baltimorian
But the Birds are the best
The best of Baltimore
We like it here in Baltimore
There's so much love in Baltimore
Working hand in hand
To make this place a better land in Baltimore
Love is what you'll find
So stop and take the time
I've got Oriole baseball on my mind
We like it here in Baltimore
There's so much love in Baltimore
Working hand in hand
To make this place a better land in Baltimore
Love is what you'll find
So stop and take the time
To enjoy the brotherhood of Baltimore
The sun sets across the bay
I'm glad I spend my day
In a working American city
With all the people who make it that way
It's time to jump in a taxi
For Thirty Third Street
Knowing I'll be watching those Birds go
Watching Weaver's show 
We like it here in Baltimore
There's so much love in Baltimore
Working hand in hand
To make this place a better land in Baltimore
Love is what you'll find
So stop and take the time
'Cause I've got Oriole baseball on my mind
We like it here in Baltimore
There's so much love in Baltimore
We're working hand in hand
To make this place a better land in Baltimore
Love is what you'll find
So stop and take the time
'Cause I've got Oriole baseball on my mind
On my mind in Baltimore
Baltimore
Baltimore
Baltimore
Baltimore
