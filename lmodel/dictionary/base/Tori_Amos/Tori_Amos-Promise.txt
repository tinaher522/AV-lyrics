<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Promise">
Promise not to say
That you told you so
Promise not to say
That I'm getting too old
Promise not to take
Never take your phone
I mean take their word
You mean over yours
What I need to know will you
Be there
Where the sun shines
I will be there
You are the light
That follows you everywhere
Look for my love
Where the sun shines
I will be there
Will you
Promise not to judge
To judge who you love
I don't know if I...
Yes make that Promise
Whatever it is
Can you hear the truth
If they accuse me
You think I'll doubt you
What I need to know will you
Be there
When I am all alone
You're not alone
When I am broken down
We all break down
When every door is closed
There is one more
Will you look for me
I will rescue you
