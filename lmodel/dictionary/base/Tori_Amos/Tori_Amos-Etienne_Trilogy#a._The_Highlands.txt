a. The Highlands
(Instrumental)
b. Etienne
Maybe I'm a witch lost in time
Running through the fields of Scotland by your side
Kicked out of France but I still believe
Taken to a land far across the sea
Etienne, Etienne
Hear the west wind whisper my name
Etienne, Etienne
By the morning maybe we'll remember who I am
Maybe you're the knight who saved my life
Maybe we faced the fire side by side
Here we are again under the same sky
As the gypsy crystal slowly dies
Etienne, Etienne
Hear the west wind whisper my name
Etienne, Etienne
By the morning maybe we'll remember who I am
I close my eyes, see you again
I know I've held you but I can't remember where or when  
Oh Etienne, Etienne
Hear the west wind whisper my name
Etienne, Etienne
By the morning maybe we'll remember who I am
Maybe I'm a witch
Etienne, ooh
Whisper my name, mmm
Whisper my name
Etienne
Whisper my name
Maybe I'm a witch
Etienne
