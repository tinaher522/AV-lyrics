<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="500_Miles">
He walked 300 miles
Just to bring, to bring me bread
His body like a sculpture
Almost decorated
And I’ll wake him as the dawn does
And we’ll break it on the bus
Saying, "This was made for us, love"
In lovers communion for 500 miles
And in 500 miles will he break
Break me again?
In lovers communion for 500 miles
And in five hundred miles will we brake
Even break?
Step it up
Grab your phone
Get your suitcase
There's no time to waste
A big adventure awaits
Sad news, France suffered a late snow
The blooms break through the ice
In San Francisco
A guitar man finally confessed
He left that actress
Over the lakes with hearts touched by frost
We fought in the Land of the Midnight Sun
I lost myself
I lost myself
I walk 300 miles
Just to bring, to bring him bread
In love some gifts are simple
Others I underrated
So I'll wake him as the dawn does
And we’ll face what any lovers must
Blueness pales within a flame's lust
In lovers communion for 500 miles
And in five hundred miles will he break
Break me again?
In lovers communion for 500 miles
And in five hundred miles will he brake
Even break?
Will we brake
Even break
Brake
Even brake
Don’t slow down
We might not even break
