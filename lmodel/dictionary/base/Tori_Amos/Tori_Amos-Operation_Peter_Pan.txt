<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Operation_Peter_Pan">
Hola, Rojo, morning to you
You always helped me chase demons away
Don't know what I'll do without you
So Pan is the name of the plane
Second to the right
Straight on till morning
That's where I'll be waiting
Second to the right
Straight on till morning
Hola, tick tock, my time is up
Pedro says I will forget him in days
In my new life no room for a lost boy
Boys can be so dumb sometimes
Second to the right
Straight on till morning
That's where I'll be waiting
Second to the right
Straight on till morning
Straight on till morning
Kiss Pedro for me
