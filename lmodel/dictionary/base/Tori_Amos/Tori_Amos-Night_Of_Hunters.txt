<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Night_Of_Hunters">
Rose so red
This night of hunters
Find love instead of their
Blood by your thorn
Rose so red
This night of hunters
Find love instead of their
Blood by my thorn
Dark forces are out there gathering
Dark forces are out there gathering
Some hunt for power
Others to invade children's dreams
Some hunt for power
Others to invade children's dreams
They must pay this night of hunters
Find love instead of their
Blood by your thorn
Find love instead of their
Blood by my thorn
Holy Father, why not ask forgiveness from the land?
Spirit to spirit, end this suffering
Spirit to spirit, soul to soul
They stole the dreams of the children
By distorting what love means
Watching over, keeping watch
Watching over, keeping watch
Watching over, keeping watch over children's dreams
The ancient seven sisters above
Tuning the frequency
Keeping watch, watching over
Keeping watch over children's dreams
The ancient seven sisters above
Changing the frequency
Watching over, keeping watch
Watching over, watching over
Keeping watch over children's dreams
The ancient seven sisters above
Turning the frequency
Keeping watch, watching over
Keeping watch
Holy Father, you ask forgiveness from the land
Sacred Mother, you are released from your chains
Spirit to spirit
The children's dreams
Must now be reclaimed
Spirit to spirit
Changing the frequency
Spirit to spirit, soul to soul
