<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Seaside">
Heard from the TV of the latest bombing
The girls were dancing, she was coming of age
Shells fired out
Flowers mowed down
Innocence targeted
Whose God is this?
Wish that she had one more day
There at the seaside, fifth of December
We chased the tide
As her treasures were gathered
I had to laugh as she gave sand a bath
Jangle jangle, jingle jangle
Jangle and circle again
Heard from the TV of the latest bombing
The girls were dancing, she was coming of age
Shells fired out
Flowers mowed down
Innocence targeted 
What God is this?
Wish that she had one more day
There at the seaside, fifth of December
We chased the tide
As her treasures were gathered
I had to laugh as she gave sand a bath
Jangle jangle, jingle jangle
Jangle and circle again
Jangle jangle, jingle jangle
Jangle and circle again
Jangle jangle, jingle jangle
Jangle and circle again
Jangle jangle, jingle jangle
Jangle and circle and end
She was coming of age
