<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Shattering_Sea">
That is not my blood on the bedroom floor
That is not the glass that I threw before
He gets his power from tide and wave
But grains of sand are my domain
His tempest surged an angry flash
Then through my arms formed a sea of glass
Shattering sea closing my eyes
Shattering sea closing my eyes
Shattering sea closing my eyes
Every line
Every curve
Every twist
Every turn of every brutal word
Every turn, every line
Every line, every curve
Every twist, every turn
Every curve of every brutal word
That is not my blood on the bedroom floor
That is not the glass that I threw before
