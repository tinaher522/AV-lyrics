<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Mountain">
Bunny slippers
Sure we'll take them
But offerings won't alter this
Do you understand?
Sure it matters if you are really
Superfly's secret wife
She'll be down
She'll be down when the mountain lets her go her way 
She'll be down when the mountain lets her go her way
So the city spits you, spits you out, rejected
Kiss the brave men that you thought had you protected
She'll be down when the mountain lets her go her way 
She'll be down when the mountain lets her go her way
So the city spits you, spits you out, rejected
Kiss the brave men that you thought had you protected
She'll be down when the mountain lets her go her way 
She'll be down when the mountain lets her go her way
So the city spits you, spits you out, rejected
Kiss the brave men that you thought had you protected
See the city, city, city now
See the city, see the city now, rejected
Kiss the brave men that you thought had you protected
She'll be down when the mountain lets her go her way
She'll be down when the mountain lets her go
Here to return
To return
To return
To return
To you
To you
To you
You
