<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Father_Figure">
That's all I wanted, something special
Something sacred in your eyes
Just for one moment, to be bold and naked at your side
Sometimes I think that you'll never understand me
Maybe this time is forever, say it can't be, well
That's all you wanted, something special
Something sacred in your life
Just for one moment, to be warm and naked by my side
Sometimes I think that you'll never understand me
All you know we'll be together 'cause we could be happy, well
I will be your father figure
Put your tiny hand in mine
I will be your preacher, teacher
Anything you have in mind
I will be your father figure
I have had enough of crime
I am the one who loves you
Till the end of time
That's all I wanted but sometimes love can be mistaken for a crime
That's all I wanted, just to see my baby's blue eyes shine
This time I think that my lover understands me
Oh, you know if we have faith in each other
Then we can be strong, oh boy
I will be your father figure
Put your tiny hand in mine
I will be your preacher, teacher
Anything you have in mind
I will be your father figure
I have had enough of crime
I'll be the one who loves you
Till the end of time
If you are the desert, I'll be the sea
If you ever hunger, hunger for me
Whatever you ask for, about what I'll be
Oh you say, it can't be
That's all I wanted, something special
Something sacred in your eyes
Just for one moment, to be bold and naked at your side
Sometimes I think that you'll never understand me
Maybe this time is forever, say it can't be
I will be your father figure
Put your tiny hand in mine
I will be your preacher, teacher
Oh, you know I will
Well, I will be your father figure
Put your tiny hand in mine
I will be your preacher, teacher
Anything you have in mind
I will be your father figure
I have had enough of crime
I will be the one who loves you
Till the end of time
