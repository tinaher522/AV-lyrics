<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Candle:_Coventry_Carol">
Candle, candle
Are the children safe now?
Unlike they were long ago
Candle, candle
Are the children safe now?
Sing their song of long ago
Candle, candle
Are the children safe now?
Unlike they were long ago
Candle, candle
Guide us and protect us
From those in darkness
From those in darkness
Lully, lulla
Thou little tiny child
By, by, lully, lullay
Thou little tiny child
By, by, lully, lullay
Oh, sisters too
How may we do
For to preserve this day
This poor youngling
For whom we do sing
By, by, lully lullay
Herod the king
In his raging
Charged he hath this day
His men of might
In his own sight
All young children to slay
That woe is me
Poor child for thee
And ever mourn and day
For thy parting
Neither say nor sing
By, by, lully lullay
Lully, lulla
Thou little tiny child
By, by, lully, lullay
Thou little tiny child
By, by, lully, lullay
