Bachelorette
You climb on rooftops and you bachelorette
You can turn dust into champagne
You even remembered his name
Bachelorette
The braves you painted pink for bachelorettes
You tried to show him that he can
But you can never rush a man
You must remember
You’re a car girl
You’re a star girl
You are at the door
The tide will turn
There’s a window
There’s a window
Bachelorette
You climb on rooftops and you bachelorette
You tried to show him that he can
But you can never rush a man
Bachelorette
The things you do girls to your bachelorettes
You thought that
Li, di-di di
You must remember
You’re a car girl
You’re a star girl
You are at the door
The tide will turn
There’s a window
There’s a window
Bachelorette
You fly alone now and you cry sometimes
There’s nothing like it in the world
You’ll go to Paris on your own
Oh, just bachelorette
You climb on rooftops and you bachelorette
You can turn dust into champagne
You even lie di die di die
