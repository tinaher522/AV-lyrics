<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Gold_Dust">
Sights and sounds pull me back down another year
I was here, I was here
Whipping past the reflecting pool
Me and you skipping school
And we make it up as we go along
We make it up we go along
You said you raced from Langley
Pulling me underneath a cherry blossom canopy
And do I have? Of course I have
Beneath my raincoat I have your photographs
And the sun on your face
I'm freezing that frame
And somewhere Alfie cries
And says, "Enjoy his every smile
You can see in the dark
Through the eyes of Laura Mars"
"How did it go so fast?"
You'll say as we are looking back
And then we'll understand
We held gold dust in our hands
Sights and sounds pull me back down another year
I was here, I was here
Gaslights glow in the street (flickering past)
Twilight held us in her palm
As we walked along
And we make it up as we go along
We make it up as we go along
Letting names hang in the air
What colour hair? (Auburn crimson)
Autumn knowingly stared
And the day that she came
I'm freezing that frame
I'm freezing that frame
And somewhere Alfie smiles
And says, "Enjoy her every cry
You can see in the dark
Through the eyes of Laura Mars"
"How did it go so fast?"
You'll say as we are looking back
And then we'll understand
We held gold dust in our hands
In our hands
