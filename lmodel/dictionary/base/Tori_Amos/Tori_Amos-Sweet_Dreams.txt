<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Sweet_Dreams">
"Lie, lie, lies everywhere"
Said the Father to the son
You're peppermint breath
Going to choke him to death 
Daddy watch your little black sheep run
He got kni- kni- knives in his back
Every time he opens up
You say, "He got to be strong
If you want to be a man"
Mister, I don't know how you can have
Sweet dreams
Sweet dreams
Land, land of liberty, we're run
By a constipated man
When you live in the past
You refuse to see
When your daughter comes home nine months pregnant
With five billion points of light 
Going to shine them on the face of your friends
They got the earth in a sling
They got the world on her knees 
They've even got your zipper between their teeth
Sweet dreams
Sweet dreams
You say, you say, you say that you have them
I say that you're a liar
Sweet dreams
Sweet dreams
Go on, go on, go on and dream
Your house is on fire
Come along now
Well, well, summer wind
Been catching up with me
"Elephant mind, missy, you don't have
You're forgetting to fly, darling
When you sleep"
I got hazy lazy Susan
Taking turns all over my dreams
I got lizards and snakes
Running through my body
Funny how they all have my face
Sweet dreams
Sweet dreams
You say, you say, you say that you have them
I say that you're a liar
Sweet dreams
Sweet dreams
Go on, go on, go on and dream
Your house is on fire
Come along now
Sweet dreams
Sweet dreams
Sweet dreams
Sweet dreams
