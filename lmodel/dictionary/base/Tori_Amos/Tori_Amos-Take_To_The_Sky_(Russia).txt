<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Take_To_The_Sky_(Russia)">
This house is like Russia
With eyes cold and grey
You've got me moving in a circle
I dyed my hair red today
I just want a little passion
To hold me in the dark
I know I've got some magic
Buried, buried deep in my heart, yeah
But my priest says, "You ain't saving no souls."
My father says, "You ain't making any money."
My doctor says, "You just took it to the limit."
And here I stand, with this sword in my hand
You can say it one more time
What you don't like
Let me hear it one more time
Then have a seat while I take to the sky
Take to the sky
My heart is like the ocean
It gets in the way
So close to touching freedom
Then I hear the guards call my name
And my priest says, "You ain't saving no souls."
My father says, "You ain't making any money."
My doctor says, "You just took it to the limit."
And here I stand, with this sword in my hand
You can say it one more time
What you don't like
Let me hear it one more time
Then have a seat while I take to the sky
Take to the sky
Voice 1:
If you don’t like me just a little, well, why do you hang around
If you don’t like me just a little, well, why do you hang around
If you don’t like me just a little, well, why do you take it, take it, take it, take it, take it
Voice 2:
There she, there she, there she goes again, wearing those purple panties
There she, there she, there she goes again, wearing her heart
There she, there she, there she goes again, why do you take it
This house is like Russia
You can say it one more time
You can say it one more time
You can say it one more time
What you don’t like
Let me hear it one more time
Then have a seat while I take to the sky
Take to the sky
Take to the sky
Take to the sky
Take to the sky
