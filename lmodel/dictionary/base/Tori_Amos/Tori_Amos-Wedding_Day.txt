<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Wedding_Day">
The deafening sound of silence
Silence the siren between us
Now I drink back the past
Back to our wedding day
We'0d hang onto every
Word that the other would say
Blanket on bluebell knoll
Under a starry night holding us close
As Jupiter winked at the Earth
On that our wedding day
I run back to your arms again
Back there safe in your arms again
Your thoughts safely were shared
My secrets to you I gave
I swore angels were born
You said heaven can be made
Above us on bluebell knoll
The laughing seven maids chased by the bull
As Virgo she danced through the dawn
On that our wedding day
I run back to your arms again
Back there safe in your arms again
The deafening sound of silence
Silence the siren between us
I run back to your arms again
Back there safe in your arms again
Now I take off the mask
That hides all this from your gaze
As you sleep I pretend you dream
Of our wedding day
