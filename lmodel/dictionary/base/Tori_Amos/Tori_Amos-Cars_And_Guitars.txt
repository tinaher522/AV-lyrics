<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Cars_And_Guitars">
If I choke, boy, you start me up again
Restring my wires, you know this gearbox can make the shift polish my rims
Oh damned if you do, damned if you don't
I swear it seems of late, boy, I've even curved this body to fit your bow
Still the rain can't confuse the thoughts that come
Come in rhythm
'Cause it never was the cars and guitars
That came between us
Still a thought says what if I
Keep on driving, keep on driving
"Yeah, that whip has skirt," you said it proud
Sometimes I'd watch her idle while you'd tune her up, me with silencer on
You and your crocodile clip, me and my alligator pears, yeah
All tricked out for the trip that slid into aspin
Still the rain can't confuse the thoughts that come
Come in rhythm
'Cause it never was the cars and guitars
That came between us
Still a thought says what if I
Keep on driving, keep on driving
You say that "I miss you"
You stop in at my drive through
You know who you'll order some, some, boy
'Cause it never was the cars and guitars
That came between us
Still a thought says what if I keep on driving
Keep on driving, keep on driving
If I choke, boy, you start me up again
Restring my wires, you know this gearbox can make the shift polish my rims
