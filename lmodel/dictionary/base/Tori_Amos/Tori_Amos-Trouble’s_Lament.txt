<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Troubleâ€™s_Lament">
Trouble needs a home girls
Trouble needs a home
She fell out with Satan
Now she's on the run
But I have found her quite straightforward
In her contracts and her deals
She warns me when Danger is
Loose behind his wheels
And he is loose behind his wheels
Don't cry baby
Trouble got evicted,
From the Devil's lair
I wager she got betrayed
By her friend Despair
Now the flames from Satan's tongue are charged
And licking at her heels
She whispers Hey Ginger, Danger's loose behind his wheels
And Satan knows how Danger makes you feel
What will be will be, baby
You don't, you don't need to cry
There are no tears in my eyes
If Danger wants to find me
I'll let him in, he can find me
Trouble needs a home girls
A covert abode
From Tucson to Ohio
Back through Tobacco road
And she is armed and will fight for the souls
Of girls around the world.
Standing up to Satan
Dancing on st. Michael's sword
I'm on her side, in this brutal war
Don't cry baby
You don't, you don't need to cry
There are no tears in my eyes
If Danger wants to find me
I'll let him in, he can find me
Trouble needs a home girls
Trouble needs a home
Trouble needs a home girls
Will you give her one
Trouble needs a home,
Trouble needs a home
