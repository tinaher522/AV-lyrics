<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="I_Don't_Like_Mondays">
Mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm
The silicon chip inside her head
Gets switched to overload
And nobody's gonna go to school today
She gonna make them stay at home
And Daddy doesn't understand it
He always said she was good as gold
And he can see no reasons
'Cause there are no reasons
What reasons do you need to be shown?
Tell me why
I don't like Mondays
Tell me why
I don't like Mondays
I don't like, I don't like, I don't like Mondays
Tell me why I don't like Mondays
I want to shoot the whole day down
Down, down, shoot it all down
And all the playing's stopped in the playground now
She wants to play with her toys a while
And school's out early and soon we'll be learning
The lesson today is how to die
And then the bullhorn cackles and the captain tackles
With the problems and the how's and why's
And he can see no reason
'Cause there are no reason
What reason do you need to die, die, oh?
Tell me why
I dont like Mondays
Tell me why
I don't like Mondays
I don't like, I don't like, I don't like Mondays
Tell me why
I dont like Mondays
Tell me why
I don't like Mondays
I don't like, I don't like, I don't like Mondays
I don't like Mondays
I want to shoot the whole day down
