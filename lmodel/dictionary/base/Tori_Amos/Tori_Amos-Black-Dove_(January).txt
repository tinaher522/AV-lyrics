<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Black-Dove_(January)">
She was a January girl
She never let on how insane it was
In that tiny kinda scary house
By the woods, by the woods, by the woods, by the woods
By the woods, by the woods, by the woods, by the woods
Black-dove, black-dove
You're not a helicopter
You're not a cop-out either
Honey, black-dove, black-dove
You don't need a space ship
They don't know you've already lived
On the other side of the galaxy
The other side of the galaxy
The other side of the galaxy
She had a January world
So many storms not right somehow
How a lion becomes a mouse
By the woods, by the woods, by the woods, by the woods
By the woods, by the woods, by the woods, by the woods
But I have to get to Texas
Said I have to get to Texas
And I'll give away my blue, blue dress
My blue dress
Black-dove, black-dove
You're not a helicopter
You're not a cop-out either
Honey, black-dove, black-dove
You don't need a space ship
They don't know you've already lived
On the other side of the galaxy
The other side of
The other side of the galaxy
But I have to get to Texas
Said I have to get to Texas
Said I'm going to wear my blue dress
Because, cowboy, the snakes they are my kin
Are my kin
She was a January girl
She never let on how insane it was
In that tiny kinda scary house
By the woods, by the woods, by the woods, by the woods
By the woods, by the woods, by the woods, by the woods
By the woods, by the woods, by the woods, black-dove
