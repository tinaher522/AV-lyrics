<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Floating_City">
You went away
Why did you leave me? You know I believed you
Nothing explained
Where are the answers? I know I need you
Tell me is your city paved with gold?
Is there hunger? Do your people grow old?
Do your governments have secrets that they've sold?
Every night I wait
Take me away to your floating city
By my window at night
I see the lights to your floating city
Come and take me away
I want to play in your floating city
Floating city
TV turns off
Any of us that say that we've seen you
Tell me
Are we the only planet that can't conceive you
Will we be like Atlantis long ago?
So assured that we're advanced with what we know
That our spirit never had time to grow?
Every night I wait
Take me away to your floating city
By my window at night
I see the lights to your floating city
Come and take me away, yeah
I want to play in your floating city
Floating city, yeah
Is it weak to look for saviours out in space?
Little Earth she tries so hard to change our ways
Sometimes she must get sick of this place
Every night I wait
Take me away to your floating city
By my window at night
I see the lights to your floating city
Come and take me away
I want to play in your floating city
Floating city
Every night I wait
Take me away to your floating city
By my window at night
I see the lights to your floating city
Come and take me away
I want to play in your floating city
Floating city, yeah
