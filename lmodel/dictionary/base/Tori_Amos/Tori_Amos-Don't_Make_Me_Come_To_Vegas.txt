<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Don't_Make_Me_Come_To_Vegas">
Don't make me come to Vegas
Don't make me pull you out of his bed
I am vigilant that it will not be you
On the menu he's serving up for his friends
Don't make me come to Vegas
Don't make me pull him out of your head
Athena will attest that it could be done
And it has been done and I think that I am up to it
And the Jacaranda tree
She is telling me of the trouble you're in
Just by the way she bends
Remember dancing and wondering as you were swaying
What kind of woman you'd be
"What will be will be"
Over my dead body
Slip through your hand (slip through your hand)
Again and again
My old flame was a jester and a joker
And as dealer of men, they called him the prince
A prince of black jacks and of women
And of anything that slipped into his hands
And the ranches and the mustangs
And the way you said, "You can't have all this except for me
You see Lady Luck is my mistress
And you'll have to play second to her wish"
And the Jacaranda tree
Is telling me it's not over yet
Just by the way she bends
"If you come breezing through"
You said, "I'll know that it's you
By the taste on my lips"
Bet on the desert's kiss
I could slip through your net
"Over my dead body"
Slip through your hand (slip through your hand)
Again and again
Slip through your hand (slip through your hand)
Again and again
Don't make me come to Vegas
Don't make me come to Vegas
Don't make me come to Vegas
