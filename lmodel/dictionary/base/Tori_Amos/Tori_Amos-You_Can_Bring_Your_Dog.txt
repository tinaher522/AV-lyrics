<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="You_Can_Bring_Your_Dog">
You can bring your dog, I got three
He can play the wolf for the evening
If you were to get lost behind these locks
Ain't that a good thing
Ain't that a good thing
Ain't that a good thing 'cause
I'm not makin' any promises
I'm not livin' to be the Mrs.
I'm not makin' any promises, honey
But you still got that somethin', pretty boy
You still got that somethin' as a man
You still got that somethin'
Of this I know
Of this I know
That one fancies herself as a black lab
I hear that your old flame is a pure breed
Me? I guess you could say I'm a Siamese
Ain't that a good thing
Ain't that a good thing
Ain't that a good thing 'cause
I'm not makin' any promises
You'll be too busy, boy, to sue her for damages
I'm not makin' any promises, honey
But you still got that somethin', pretty, boy
You still got that somethin' as a man
You still got that somethin'
Of this I know
Of this I know
You can bring your dog anytime
You can bring your dog
You can bring your dog
You can bring them all
You can bring your mom
Bring your dog
Baby, baby, please now
Bring, bring your love
