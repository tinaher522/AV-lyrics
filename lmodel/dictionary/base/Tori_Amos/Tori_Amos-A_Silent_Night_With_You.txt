<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="A_Silent_Night_With_You">
The radio plays
My holiday faves
It takes me back
To when our love was new
Young lovers pass
Me by with their glow
That used to be us
Not so long ago
You said then,
"I just want to spend
A silent night with you, with you.
A silent night with you."
Joy to the world
Your arms kept me warm
Night after night
In such a cold world
Hear the bells strike
Old pictures instead
Tell me the past
Is filling my head
You said then,
"I just want to spend
A silent night with you, with you.
A silent night with you."
The radio plays
My holiday faves
It takes me back to
When our love was new
Lost in my daze
You slip past and say,
"Girl, take my hand.
See nothing has changed.
Now or then
I just want to spend
A silent night with you, with you.
A silent night with you."
All is calm
All is bright
