<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Strange_Little_Girl">
One day you see a strange little girl look at you
One day you see a strange little girl feeling blue
She'd run to the town one day
Leaving home and her country fair
Just beware, when you're there
Strange little girl
She didn't know how to live in a town that was rough
(I'm done thanking you)
It didn't take long before she knew she'd had enough
Walking home in her wrapped up world
She survived but she's feeling old
'Cause she found all things cold
Strange little girl, where are you going?
Strange little girl, where are you going?
Strange little girl you really should be
Really should be going
(I know you wish you would)
(I know you wish you would)
I know, I know
(I know you wish you would)
One day you see a strange little girl look at you
(I'm done thanking you)
One day you see a strange little girl feeling blue
(I'm done thanking you)
Walking home in her wrapped up world
She survived but she's feeling old
'Cause she found all things cold
Strange little girl, where are you going?
Strange little girl, where are you going?
Strange little girl you really should be
Really should be, really should be
Strange little girl, where are you going?
Strange little girl, where are you going?
Strange little girl you really should be
Really should be, really should
Strange little girl, where are you going?
Strange little girl, where are you going?
Strange little girl you really should be
Really should be, really should be
Really should be going
