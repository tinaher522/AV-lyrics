<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Father's_Son">
Steady, girl, on your feet
You and your wonderings
Bread can feed a few
So can some cartoons
So it ends, so it begins
I am my father's son
Plant another seed of hate
In a trusting virgin gun
Steady, girl, for the show
God versus God ringside
Littered with corpses
Neither God can forgive
So the desert blooms
Strawberry cactus
Can you blame nature
If she's had enough of us?
So it ends, so it begins
I am my father's son
Plant another seed of hate
In a trusting virgin gun
Steady, boy, watch them pray
To you I suspect
If you keep my flesh firm
I'll ready those sacraments
So it ends, so it begins
I am my father's son
So it ends, so it begins
I am my father's son
Plant another seed of hate
In another father's son
