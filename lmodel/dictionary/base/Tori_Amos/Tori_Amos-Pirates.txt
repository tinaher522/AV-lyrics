<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Pirates">
Hello? Hello? Hello?
I travelled far from my home
Foreign streets paved with stone
Deep in my dreams, Moroccan sand
Now I sail my ship on dry land, hey
There is a light that shines on the frontier
Pirates, yeah, pirates
And on a dark night when you feel lonely
And the when world just can't understand you
Pirates, yeah, pirates, yeah
Steal the jewel, watch it break
It cuts with an eye, I can't escape
The ruby heals, alone I stand
When I sail my ship on dry land, hey
There is a light that shines on the frontier
Pirates, yeah, pirates
And on a dark night when you feel lonely
And the when world just can't understand you
Pirates, yeah, pirates
There is a light that shines on the frontier
Pirates, yeah, yeah
Pirates, yeah
Pirates, yeah
There is a light that shines on the frontier
And, baby, some day we're going to be there
Pirates, yeah, pirates
And on a dark night when you feel lonely
And when the world just can't understand you
Pirates, yeah, pirates
There is a light that shines on the frontier
Pirates, yeah, pirates, yeah
There is a light that shines on the frontier
