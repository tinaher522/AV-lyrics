<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="General_Joy">
General Joy, I know, I know you'll take me there
(Where your boys were left behind)
General Joy, it seems you need a soldier girl
(Now they have liberty gagged)
By boat, by tram, by motorbus
Could it be the fates are protecting us
From the hawks that have stolen the bird from the sky
And I know you will always love sorrow
Is that why you gave her dress to happiness
'Cause it matches her eyes when she cries
General Joy, it seems you don't love your bride
(That doesn't mean you're a bad guy)
Generally you're friends but she is not the
Love of your life
To dye, to perm, to change your hair
Or your wife, the possibilities are there
And it's time for you to decide
And I know you will always love sorrow
Is that why you gave her dress to happiness
'Cause it matches her eyes when she cries
General Joy, I know, I know you'll take me there
(But you'll need strength from within)
General Joy, it seems you need a soldier girl
(And a willing coalition)
By boat, by tram, by motorbus
Could it be the hawks are protecting us
From the men who have now assumed their name
And I know you will always love sorrow
Is that why you gave her dress to happiness
'Cause it matches her eyes when she cries
'Cause it matches her eyes when she cries
