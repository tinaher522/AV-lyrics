<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Your_Cloud">
Where the river cross, crosses the lake
Where the words jump off my pen and into your pages
Do you think, just like that, you can divide this
You as yours, me as mine, to before we were us
If the rain has to separate from itself
Does it say, "Pick out your cloud"?
Pick out your cloud
Voice 1:
I'm going to stay right here
I'm going to stay with this
I'm going to stay right here
I'm going to stay with this
I'm going to stay right here
Voice 2:
If there is a horizontal line
That runs from the map off your body
Straight through the land
Shooting up right through my heart
Will this horizontal line
When asked know how to find
Where you end, where I begin
"Pick out your cloud"
How light can play and form a ring
(I found, I found, I found a thrill)
Of rain that can change bows into arrows
(I found, I found, I found a thrill)
Who we were isn't lost before we were us
Indigo is his own, Blue always knew this
If the rain has to separate from itself
Does it say, "Pick out your cloud"?
Pick out your cloud
Voice 1:
I'm going to stay right here
I'm going to stay with this
I'm going to stay right here
I'm going to stay with this
I'm going to stay right here
Voice 2:
If there is a horizontal line
That runs from the map off your body
Straight through the land
Shooting up right through my heart
Will this horizontal line
When asked know how to find
Where you end, where I begin
"Pick out your cloud"
If the rain has to separate from itself
Does it say, "Pick out your cloud"?
