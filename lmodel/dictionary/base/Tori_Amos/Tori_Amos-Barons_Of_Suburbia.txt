Barons of suburbia
Take another piece of my good graces
I'm in my war, you're in yours
Do we fight for peace as they take another piece of us?
But, baby, I would let your darkness invade me
You could maybe turn this white light into navy
Before you leave
It was a slight miscalculation
That my friends, my friends would be waiting
On the other side of the bridge
On the other side of this
This mole hill of a mountain
This potion now a poison
They're on the other side of right
We're on the other side of her midnight, midnight, midnight
When it's all said and done
We will lose a piece to a carnivorous vegetarian
Barons of suburbia
I have heard you pray before you devour her
So, baby, will you let my darkness invade you
You always liked your wafer sweet in the middle
Before you leave
It was a slight miscalculation
That our friends, our friends would be waiting
On the other side of the bridge
On the other side of this
This mole hill of a mountain
This potion now a poison
They're on the other side of right
We're on the other side of her midnight, midnight, midnight
I am piecing a potion to combat your poison
I am piecing a potion to combat your poison
I am piecing a potion to combat your poison
I'm piecing a potion to combat your poison
I'm piecing a potion to combat your poison
I'm piecing a potion to combat your poison
I'm piecing a potion to combat your poison
I'm piecing a potion to combat your poison
She is risen
She is risen, boys
I said, she is risen
