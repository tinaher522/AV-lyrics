<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Here._In_My_Head">
In my head I found you there
And running around and following me
But you don't dare
But I find that I have now more than I ever wanted to
So maybe Thomas Jefferson wasn't born
In your backyard like you have said
And maybe I'm just the horizon you run to
When she has left you there
You are here in my head
And running around and calling me
"Come back I'll show you the roses that brush off the snow
And open their petals again and again"
And you know that apple green ice cream can melt in your hands
I can't so I held your hand at the fair
And even forgot what time it was
And even if Thomas Jefferson wasn't born
In your backyard like you have said
And maybe I'm just the horizon you run to
When she has left you and me here alone on the floor
You're counting my feathers as the bells toll
You see the bow and belt and the girl from the south
All favorites of mine, you know them all well
And spring brings fresh little puddles
That makes it all clear, makes it all
Do you know
Do you know what this is doing to me
Here
Here
Here
Here in my head
