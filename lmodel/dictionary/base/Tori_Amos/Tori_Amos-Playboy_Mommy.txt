<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Playboy_Mommy">
In my platforms I hit the floor
Fell face down didn't help my brain out
Then the baby came before I found
The magic how to keep her happy
I never was the fantasy
Of what you want wanted me to be
But don't judge me so harsh little girl
So you've got a playboy mommy
But when you tell them my name and
You want to cross that bridge all on your own
Little girl they'll do you no harm
Because they know your playboy mommy
But when you tell them my name
From here to Birmingham, I got a few friends
I never was there, was there when it counts
I get my way you're so like me
You seemed ashamed, ashamed that I was
A good friend of American soldiers
I'll say it loud here by your grave
Those angels can't ever take my place
Don't judge me so harsh little girl
You got a playboy mommy
But when you tell them my name and
You want to cross that bridge all on your own
Little girl they'll do you no harm
Because they know your playboy mommy
But you just tell them my name
You tell them my name, I got a few friends
Somewhere where the orchids grow
I can't find those church bells
That played when you died
Played Gloria, talking about Hosanna
Don't judge me so harsh little girl
You got a playboy mommy come home
But when you tell them soldiers my name
You cross that bridge all on your own
Little girl they'll do you no harm
'Cause they know your playboy mommy
But I'll be home, I'll be home
To take you in my arms
