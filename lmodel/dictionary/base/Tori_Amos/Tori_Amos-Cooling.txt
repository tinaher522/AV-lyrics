<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Cooling">
Maybe I didn’t like hear
But I still can’t believe Speed Racer is dead
So then I thought I’d make some plans
But fire thought she’d really rather be water instead
And Peggy got a message for me from Jesus
And I've heard every word that you have said
And I know I have been driven like the snow
But this is cooling faster than I can
This is cooling faster than I
But do I hate what she is or do I want to be her
And don’t we love something fresh, anything new, virgin
Woman you got too many brambles hiding under these bushes
Woman you got too many brambles but I always liked a good storm
Always good for a storm
So then love walked up to like
And said I know that you don’t like me much, let’s go for a ride
This ocean is wrapped around that pineapple tree
And is your place in heaven worth giving up these kisses
These, yes, these kisses
And Peggy got a message for me from Jesus
And I heard every word that you have said
And I know I have been driven like the snow
But this is cooling faster than I can
Hey faster than I can
Cooling
This is cooling
This is cooling
