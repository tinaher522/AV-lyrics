<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Comfort_And_Joy">
The bagel man said
"T., what will you have
And where is that husband?"
I paused, "In London"
"When's he coming back?"
"Tomorrow he lands"
"When I was a lad
A Christmas I had
Was in London town
Surrounded by singing"
Let nothing, no, nothing, nothing you dismay
Remember the light is born every day
With tidings of comfort and joy and joy
Tidings of comfort and joy and joy
With the world at war
A Europe then torn
What family was left said
"We must brave the new world"
While waiting to board
Our boat for New York
Some carolers came
To wave farewell singing
Let nothing, no, nothing, nothing you dismay
Remember the light is born every day
With tidings of comfort and joy and joy
Tidings of comfort and joy and joy
And joy
