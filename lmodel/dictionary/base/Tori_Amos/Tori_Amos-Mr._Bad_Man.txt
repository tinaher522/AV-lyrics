<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Mr._Bad_Man">
He's a bad man, Mr. Bad Man
And she had enough of him
So the wolves try to dry her eyes
'Cause the bad man made her cry
But every day I know that
I may just be closer 
To the sea of frozen words
Words that even soldiers
Would lay down their swords for
And they come in every color
And flavour too doo doo doo doo
And flavour too doo doo doo doo
There's a gold star on a gendarme
So she asked him, "Hey, can you hold my song?
It's the one piece that I got left
So hide it well," she said
He's a bad man 
Just a bad, bad man
Mr. Bad Man
Such a bad man
And she had enough of him
So the wolves try to dry her eyes
'Cause the bad man made her cry
But every day I know that
I may just be closer 
To the sea of frozen words
Words that even soldiers
Would lay down their swords for
And they come in every color
And flavour too doo doo doo doo
And flavour too doo doo doo doo
And flavour too doo doo doo doo
