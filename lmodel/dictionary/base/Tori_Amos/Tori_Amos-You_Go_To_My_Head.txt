<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="You_Go_To_My_Head">
Sweet love... hello, make a slave of me; 
I should have more control...
Little dove, hello, you take full advantage of my open window...
When the cold of the night has washed away,
All I want is to wake in your arms...
And I know that I shouldn't let you stay, 
But I'm a lush for your love...
You go to my head... 
You go to my head... 
You go to my head,
And you know I can never say no to you and your friend...
You call... oh, no; (You know you want him...)
Boy, your heart swings in the wind from rose to rose....
Honeybee, go home (Please stay...) to that warm nest you left minutes ago...
Yes, I understand you give your time;
Can't you see I've given my heart?
All that light in your eyes is from the wine, babe;
I'm such a lush for your love...
You go to my head... 
You go to my head... 
You go to my head,
And you know I can never say no to you and your friend, oh, yeah...
Hey, I'm a lush, baby, for your love, yeah!
You go to my head, c'mon!
You go to my head... 
You go to my head,
And you know I can never... never! Never say no!
You-you go to, go to my head! 
You go to my head... 
You go to my head...
Hey... when you go there, got to go there, baby...
When you go there, I tell you.. 
The cold... washed away...
Cold of the night... washed away...
Cold of the night... washed away... yeah...
