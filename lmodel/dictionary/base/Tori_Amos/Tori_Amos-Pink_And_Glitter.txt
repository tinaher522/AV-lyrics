<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Pink_And_Glitter">
Darn Roses, that is what you call
All the girls in the world, even the thorns
You're surrounded by an army of two
Who adore you
Our joy isn't about a present or a grown up motor toy
And little boys all get an honorable mention from me
But this year I'm thinking
Shower the world
Shower the world
Shower the world with pink if you please
Shower the world
Shower the world
Shower the world
Black satin is what I wore
That and our hearts left on the floor
How was I, in that marshmallow snow, to know?
My life would change that night
Our joy isn't about a present or a grown up motor toy
And little boys all get an honorable mention from me
But this year I'm thinking
Shower the world
Shower the world
Shower the world with pink if you please
Shower the world
Shower the world
Shower the world
In pink we will paint the town
Champagne never looked so divine
On his lips the sweetest words,
"Love, you've given me quite a ride."
Our joy isn't about a present or a grown up motor toy
And little boys all get an honorable mention from me
But this year I'm thinking
Shower the world
Shower the world
Shower the world with pink and glitter
Shower the world
Shower the world
Shower the world with pink
