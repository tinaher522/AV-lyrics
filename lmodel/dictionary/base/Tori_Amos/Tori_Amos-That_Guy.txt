<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="That_Guy">
That guy swears he will walk
And carries a chip as big as New York
That guy at night makes me scream
And smashes the best possibilities
That guy just brings his war home, she cries
"Why can’t Daddy leave his war, war outside?"
That guy when he wants can love
Like no other love until the darkness comes
Do we make up to break up?
Do we break up then wake up
To cuts instead of kisses?
To cuts instead, instead, instead
That guy swears he will walk
And carries a chip as big as New York
That guy cannot seem to see
There’re no other guys but the one he used to be
Do we make up to break up?
Do we break up then wake up
To cuts instead of kisses?
To cuts instead, instead, instead
Will we make up?
Will we break up?
Will I wake up with, with
That guy
That guy
That guy
