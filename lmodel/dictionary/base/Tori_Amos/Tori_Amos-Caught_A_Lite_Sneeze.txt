<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Caught_A_Lite_Sneeze">
Caught a lite sneeze
Caught a light breeze
Caught a lightweight lightning seed
Boys on my left side
Boys on my right side
Boys in the middle and you're not here
I need a big loan from the girl zone
Building tumbling down
Didn't know our love was so small
Couldn't stand at all
Mr. St. John just bring your son
The spire is hot and my cells can't feed
And you've still got that Belle dragging your foots, yes
I'm hiding it well Sister Ernestine
But I still got that Belle dragging my foots, yes
Building tumbling down
Didn't know our love was so small
Couldn't stand at all
Mr. St. John just bring your son
(Inanna, Inanna, Inanna, bring your son)
Right on time you get closer and closer
Called my name there's no way in
Use that fame rent your wife and kids today
Yeah maybe she will, I said maybe she will
Caught a lite sneeze
Dreamed a little dream
Made my own pretty hate machine
Boys on my left side
Boys on my right side
Boys in the middle and you're not here
Boys in their dresses and you're not here
I need a big loan from the girl zone
I need a big loan from the girl zone
Building tumbling down
Didn't know our love was so small
Couldn't stand at all
Mr. St. John just bring your son
(Inanna, Inanna, Inanna, bring your son)
