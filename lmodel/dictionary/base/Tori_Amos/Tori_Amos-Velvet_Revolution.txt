<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Velvet_Revolution">
Feeling radical in cotton
Purified in my satin
But the bomb of the season
Is a Velvet Revolution
I look at the sky
And feel the tears of the prophets crying
I look at the sky
And feel the rain, the rain of tears
Feeling radical in cotton
Purified in my satin
But the bomb of the season
Is a Velvet Revolution
All you killers of the children
There's a new commandment
The true Divine Creator
Wants a Velvet Revolution
All you killers of the children
There's a new commandment
The true Divine Creator
Wants a Velvet Revolution
