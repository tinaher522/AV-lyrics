<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Tear_In_Your_Hand">
All the world just stopped now
So you say you don't want to stay together any more
Let me take a deep breath, babe
If you need me, me and Neil'll be hanging out with the Dream King
Neil said hi by the way
I don't believe you're leaving 'cause me and Charles Manson like the same ice cream
I think it's that girl
And I think there're pieces of me you've never seen
Maybe she's just pieces of me you've never seen, well
All the world is all I am
The black of the the blackest ocean and that tear in your hand
All the world is dangling, dangling, dangling for me, darling
You don't know the power that you have with that tear in your hand
Tear in your hand
Voice 1:
Maybe I ain't used to
Maybes smashing in a cold room
Cutting my hands up
Every time I touch you
Voice 2:
I ain't
Used to
Crying
You still
Sometimes
Use me
Maybe it's time to wave goodbye now
Time to wave goodbye now
Caught a ride with the moon
I know I know you well, well, better than I used to
Haze all clouded up my mind
In the daze of the why it could've never been
So you say and I say you know you're full of wish
And your "baby, baby, baby, babies"
I tell you there're peices of me you've never seen
Maybe she's just pieces of me you've never seen, well
All the world is all I am
The black of the the blackest ocean and that tear in your hand
All the world is dangling, dangling, dangling for me, darling
You don't know the power that you have with that tear in your hand
Tear in your hand
With that tear in your hand
Tear in
