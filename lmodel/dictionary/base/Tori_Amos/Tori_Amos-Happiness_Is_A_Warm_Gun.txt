Happiness is a warm gun
Happiness is a warm gun, mama
Happiness is a warm gun, mama
Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother Superior jump the gun
Said, Mother Superior jump the gun
Said I'm gonna, Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother Superior jump the gun
Said I'm gonna, Mother Superior jump the gun, jump the gun
She's not a girl who misses much
She's not a girl who misses much
Ooh
She's well acquainted with the touch
She's well acquainted with the touch of the velvet hand
Keep it
I need
I said I need a fix, 'cause I
I need a
I need, I need, I need
I need, I need, I, I need
Oh my, I need, I need, mama, I need
And I need, I need, I need, 'cause
Happiness is a warm gun
Happiness is a warm gun, mama
Happiness is a warm gun, mama
I need you
I need you
She's not a girl who misses much
She's not a girl who misses much
Mother Superior, down
I need a fix, 'cause I'm going down
I need a fix, 'cause I'm going down
I need a fix, 'cause I'm going down
I need a fix
Mama, I need a fix, 'cause I'm going down
Down to the bits that I left uptown
Down to the bits that I left uptown
Down to the bits that I left uptown
I said I need a fix, 'cause I'm going down
I need, I need, I need
Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother
Happiness is happiness 
Mama, mama, mama
