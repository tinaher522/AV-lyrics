<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Stille_Nacht,_Heilige_Nacht_(Silent_Night,_Holy_Night)">
Silent night, holy night
All is calm, all is bright
Round young virgin mother and child
Holy infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace
Silent night, holy night
When thou smil’st love beams bright
Pierce the darkness all around
Son of God, thy birth doth sound
Our salvation’s hour
Our salvation’s hour
Silent night, holy night
Sleeps the earth, calm and quiet
Lovely child, now take thy rest
On thy mother’s gentle breast
Sleep in heavenly peace, in peace
Sleep in heavenly peace
Just sleep in heavenly peace
