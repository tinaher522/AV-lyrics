<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Invisible_Boy">
You are
Are not just
An invisible boy
But if you want to be one
An invisible boy
You could go under cover
Make your great escape
Go where only eagles dare go
Without needing wings
Jump on a triumph like Steve McQueen
It's time you lived your dream
"But how can this be" you say
"Won't it all fade away
If I'm only made out of clay
Only made out of clay"
You are
Are not just
An invisible boy
Bit if you want to reach her
As an invisible boy
You could sit down beside her
Hold her as she cries
Call upon your friends the cloud riders
To unlock the sky
Then wave to the snowdrops skating by
Catch the laughter from her eyes
"But how can this be" you say
"Won't it all fade away
If I'm only made out of clay
Only made out of clay"
You are
Are not just
An invisible boy
But if you want to be one
An invisible boy
You could cross over to the
Great Pub in the Sky
There you'll find him listening to a lost soul
Pouring them a pint
Then you'll know you have missed his advice
And he'll look you in the eye
"If you want to be" he'll say
"To be only partially a boy that's made out of clay
We're all made out of clay
But not you
You are my best invisible boy
And if you want to be this
An invisible boy
Then only those who can see you
Will be better off because they can
See and believe in
My best invisible boy
My best invisible boy"â€¨
