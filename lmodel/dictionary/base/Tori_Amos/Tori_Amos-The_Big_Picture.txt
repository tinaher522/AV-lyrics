<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="The_Big_Picture">
Someone smashed my window, broke into my brand new car last night
Caught my boyfriend looking at another slender pair of thighs
Got to make more money, got to get, got to get there faster than the rest
Knock 'em off the ladder if they even seem to stand a chance
The big picture, got a big white cloud
The big picture is staring at me, staring at me
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah
The big picture
Why do I feel so threatened that somebody else will take what's mine?
Babe it's only rented, no one really owns the merchandise
What about what I want? Somehow it got lost somewhere inside
My mother's on my case, I told her it's my life, well, she just died
The big picture, got a big white cloud
The big picture is staring at me, staring at me
The big picture on a big blank wall, hey
The big picture is staring at me, staring at me
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah
When I can see, I'll try again, I've got my paints
The big picture
The big picture
The big picture, got a big white cloud
The big picture is staring at me, staring at me
The big picture yeah, on a big blank wall
The big picture yeah, is staring at me, staring at me
