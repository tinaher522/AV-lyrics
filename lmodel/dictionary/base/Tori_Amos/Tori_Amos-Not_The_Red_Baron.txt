<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Not_The_Red_Baron">
What language?
No, Dutch
Not the Red Baron
Not Charlie Brown
Think I've got the message figured
Another pilot down
And are there devils with halos
And beautiful capes?
Taking them into the flames
Taking them into the flames
Not Judy G
Not Jean Jean Jean with a hallowed heart
I see that screen go down in the flames
With every step
With every beautiful heel pointed
I said not the Red Baron I'm sure
Not Charlie's wonderful dog
Not anyone I really know
Just another pilot down
Maybe I'll just sing him a last little sound
Many there
Know some girls with red ribbons
The prettiest red
Ribbons
