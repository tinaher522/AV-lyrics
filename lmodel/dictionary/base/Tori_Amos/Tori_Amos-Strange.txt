<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Strange">
Strange
Thought I knew you well
Thought I had read the sky
Thought I had read a change in your eyes
So strange
Woke up to a world
That I am not a part
Except when I can play it's stranger
After all, what were you really looking for?
And I wonder when will I learn, when will I learn?
Blue isn't red, everybody knows this
And I wonder when will I learn, when will I learn?
Guess I was in deeper than I thought I was
If I have enough love for the both of us
Just stay
You said we'll build a nest
So I left my life
Tried on your friends, tried on your opinions
So when
The bridges froze and you
Did not come home
I put a snowflake under a microscope
After all, what was I really looking for?
And I wonder when will I learn, when will I learn?
Maybe my wish knew better than I did
And I wonder when will I learn, when will I learn?
Guess I was in deeper than I thought I was
If I have enough love for the both of us
So strange
Now I'm finally in
The party has begun
It's not like I can feel you still
But strange
What I will leave behind
You call me one more time
But now I must be leaving
