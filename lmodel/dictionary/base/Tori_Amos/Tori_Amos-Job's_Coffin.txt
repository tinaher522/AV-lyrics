<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Job's_Coffin">
Job's coffin looks down
Job's coffin looks down
To see what mankind is gonna do
There is a grid of disempowerment
All forces are being called to dismantle this
As Job's coffin looks down
Job's coffin looks down
To see what you're gonna do
There exists a power of old
Who wanted Earth to be controlled
But she and she alone is her own
She is her own
Job's coffin looks down
Job's coffin looks down
And can't be proud, proud of what I have done
Since time, why do we women give ourselves away
We give ourselves away
Thinking somehow that will make him want to stay
Make him stay
Job's coffin looks down
At the day you shut your power down
You must out create that destructive tendency
Little Fire Starter, heal the fury
Sister, it's time to bring it back on line
As Job's coffin looks down
Job's coffin looks down
To see what you're gonna do
To see what you're gonna do
