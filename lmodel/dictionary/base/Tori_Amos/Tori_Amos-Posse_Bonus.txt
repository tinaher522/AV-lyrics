<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Posse_Bonus">
This is your posse bonus
This is your extra
This is your posse bonus
'Cause I like you
This is your posse bonus
This is your extra
This is your posse bonus
'Cause I like you
Because I like you
'Cause I like you, Porcupine
Burrow your way to freedom
This is your posse bonus
This is your extra
This is your posse bonus
'Cause I like you
Eat your greens, feed your head
Mind the doubts they harvest them
Broccoli, feed your head
Their ideas are fried in fat
This is your posse bonus
This is your extra
This is your posse bonus
'Cause I like you
Because I like you
'Cause I like you, Porcupine
Burrow your way to freedom
You say you're not bothered
To lie beneath pigs
Then go on Laura
Here's a flower for your grave
This is your posse bonus
This is your extra
This is your posse bonus
'Cause I like you
I like you
I like you
