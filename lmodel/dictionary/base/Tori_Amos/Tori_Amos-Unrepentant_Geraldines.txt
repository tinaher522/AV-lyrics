<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Unrepentant_Geraldines">
Matthew, Mark, John, and Luke (this is the day of reckoning)
Mamma looks to you for truth (with the heart of St. Catherine)
No need to apologize (for the gypsy madonna)
Truth is not always kind (jesus hosanna)
Peter and Paul they did condemn (this is the day of reckoning)
Women like the Magdalene (she you said the savior loved best)
Now you ask me if I agree (our patron St. Cecilia)
With the unrepentant geraldines (jesus hosanna)
Chapel of birds
We sing our song revise the word
Will you pray
Pray for me unrepentant geraldines
I'm gonna free myself from your opinion
I'm gonna heal myself from your religion
I'm gonna free myself from your aggression
I'm gonna heal myself from your religion
Our Father of Corporate Greed (this is the day of reckoning)
You absolve corporate thieves (they will give the Judas kiss)
As our governments relent (guess who gets them elected)
And turn a blind eye to your sin (jesus hosanna)
Chapel of birds
We sing our song revise the word
Will you pray
Pray for me unrepentant geraldines
I'm gonna free myself from your opinion
I'm gonna heal myself from your religion
I'm gonna free myself from your aggression
I'm gonna heal myself from your religion
