<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Rattlesnakes">
Jodie wears a hat although it hasn't rained for six days
She says a girl needs a gun these days
Hey, on account of those rattlesnakes
Hey, on account of those rattlesnakes
She looks like Eve Marie Saint
In "On The Waterfront"
She reads Simone de Beauvoir
In her American circumstance
She's less than sure if her heart has come
To stay in San Jose
And her neverborn child still haunts her now
As she speeds down the freeway
As she tries her luck with the traffic police
Out of boredom more than spite
She never finds no trouble, she tries too hard
She's oblivious despite herself
She looks like Eve Marie Saint
In "On The Waterfront"
She says all she needs is therapy
All you need is love is all you need
Jodie never sleeps 'cause
There are always needles in the hay, hey
She says that a girl needs a gun these days
Hey, on account of all the rattlesnake
Hey, on account of the rattlesnakes
She looks like Eve Marie Saint
In "On The Waterfront"
She reads Simone de Beauvoir
In her American circumstance
Her heart's like crazy paving
Upside down and back to front
She says ooh, it's so hard to love
When love was your great disappointment
Hey, on account of all the rattlesnakes
She says that a girl needs a gun these days
A girl needs a gun these days
Hey, on account of all the rattlesnakes
Hey, on account of all the rattlesnakes
