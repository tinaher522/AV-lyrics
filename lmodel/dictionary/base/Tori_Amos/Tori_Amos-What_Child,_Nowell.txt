<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="What_Child,_Nowell">
What child is this who laid to rest
On Mary’s lap is sleeping?
Whom Angels greet with anthems sweet
While shepherds watch are keeping
This is winter’s gift
This is what begins
"Nowell, nowell, nowell"
Every voice was singing
"Nowell, nowell, nowell"
Born this day anew
"Nowell, nowell, nowell"
What child is this who now awakes in
Every heart each morning?
From dazzling light through silver sky
Bring peace now from creation
This is winter’s gift
This is what begins
"Nowell, nowell, nowell"
Every voice was singing
"Nowell, nowell, nowell"
Born this day anew
"Nowell, nowell, nowell"
Every voice was singing
"Nowell, nowell, nowell"
Born this day anew
Born this day anew
"Nowell, nowell, nowell, nowell"
