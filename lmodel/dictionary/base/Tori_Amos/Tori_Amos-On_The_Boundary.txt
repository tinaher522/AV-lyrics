<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="On_The_Boundary">
You said you wanted safer ground
But you got caught up in the river
I was there to save you, boy
But you'd rather drown
You said you were unhappy
But that was all right
Better than not knowing
What's on the other side
And you know I was always there for you
And you know I always believed in you
I guess that wasn't enough
On the boundary, on the boundary, baby
On the boundary, don't you need my love
You won't even let me keep you from falling
From the boundary that divides our love
I gave you a kingdom
That you could be lord in
And we both know you loved
The taste of my world
But you run back to your corner
Where you trip over your lines
Look left, look right
No room to hide
On the boundary, on the boundary, baby
On the boundary, don't you need my love
You won't even let me keep you from falling
From the boundary that divides our love
I guess that wasn't enough
I guess I wasn't enough
On the boundary, on the boundary, baby
On the boundary, don't you need my love
You won't even let me keep you from falling
From the boundary that divides our love
Somewhere, don't you need me?
Somewhere, don't you need me?
On the boundary, on the boundary, baby
On the boundary, don't you need my love
You won't even let me keep you from falling
From the boundary that divides our love
Don't you need me? Somewhere
Somewhere, don't you need me?
On the boundary, on the boundary, baby
On the boundary, don't you need my love
You won't even let me keep you from falling
From the boundary that divides our love
