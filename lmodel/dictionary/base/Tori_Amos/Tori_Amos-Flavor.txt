<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Flavor">
Battle of the minds
Cries Below cries Above
You must pick a side
Will you choose fear?
Will you choose love?
What does it look like,
This orbital ball from the fringes of The Milky Way?
What does it feel like,
This orbital ball on the fringes of The Milky Way?
Raining flavor
Icing flavor
Flavor love
Whose God then is God?
They all want jurisdiction
In the Book of Earth
Whose God spread fear?
Spread love?
And what does it look like,
This orbital ball from the fringes of The Milky Way?
What does it feel like,
This orbital ball on the fringes of The Milky Way?
Raining Flavor
Icing Flavor
Flavor love
Turn up the frequency
What does it look like,
This orbital ball from the fringes of The Milky Way?
What does it feel like,
This orbital ball on the fringes of The Milky Way?
Raining flavor
Icing flavor
Spread that flavor
Flavor flavor flavor
