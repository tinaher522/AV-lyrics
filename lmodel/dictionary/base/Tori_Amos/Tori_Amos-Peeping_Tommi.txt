<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Peeping_Tommi">
Looking past branches
Past fresh mown grass
Dirt licking my elbows
I watch his hand move up, up, up her dress
Don't run away from me now
Don't run away from me now
She's down on the ground
She gives the boy smile
I think of you
I think of the man all the while
You see my dreams
Are filled with him
His face shows
Up, up, up in my favourite danish
Don't run away from me now
Don't run away from me now
She's willing
Just breathe
Willing
One day I'll be
Sail through my ears
I heard you fine the first time
Time to let it go
Time to give my gun a nice surprise, surprise
Willing
Just breathe
Willing
Peeping Tommi
