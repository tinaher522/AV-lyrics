<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="The_Waitress">
So I want to kill this waitress
She's worked here a year longer than I
If I did it fast you know that's an act of kindness
But I believe in peace
I believe in peace, bitch
I believe in peace
I believe in peace
I believe in peace, bitch
I believe in peace
I want to kill this waitress
I can't believe this violence in mind
And his her power all in her club sandwich?
But I believe in peace
I believe in peace, bitch
I believe in peace
I believe in peace
I believe in peace, bitch
I believe in peace
I want to kill this killing wish
They're too many stars and not enough sky
Boys all think she's living kindness
Ask a fellow waitress
Ask a fellow waitress
