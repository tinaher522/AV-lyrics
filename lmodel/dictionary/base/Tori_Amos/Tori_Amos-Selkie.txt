<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Selkie">
Selkie unzips her skin, finally determined
Through a window in the dark, there he sits all alone
I been waiting on the love of my life to find
He's been waiting on his Selkie to come back - he said
"I know these shores are not like yours,
But will you make your home in my arms?"
Selkie battled tide and wave, just to gaze upon his face
Hiding behind rocks to learn if he found a new love
Lorelei sings the song for Lovers
Who were torn apart, then left broken-hearted
Lorelei hears the cry of Lovers
That the Sea of Fate had separated
Selkie puts her hand in his - he knows the gift she gives
There inside his cabinet, folded safe, her seal skin
I been waiting on the love of my life to find
He's been waiting on his Selkie to come back - he said
"I know these shores are not like yours,
But will you make your home in my arms?"
