<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Time">
the smart money's on harlow
and the moon is in the street
and the shadow boys are breaking all the laws
you're east of east st. louis
and the wind is making speeches
and the rain sounds like a round of applause
and napoleon is weeping in a carnival saloon
his invisible fiance is in the mirror
the band is going home
it's raining hammers, it's raining nails
it's true, there's nothing left for him down here
and it's time time time
and it's time time time
and it's time time time
that you love
and it's time time time
well they all pretend they're orphans
and their memory's like a train
you can see it getting smaller as it pulls away
and the things you can't rememeber
tell the things you can't forget
that history puts a saint in every dream
well she said she'd stick around
until the bandages came off
but these mama boys just don't know when to quit
matilda asks the sailors, are those dreams
or are those prayers
so just close your eyes, son
this won't hurt a bit
and it's time time time
and it's time time time
and it's time time time
that you love
and it's time time time
well, things are pretty lousy for a calendar girl
the boys just dive right off the cars
and splash into the street
and when they're on a roll
she pulls a razor from her boot
and a thousand pigeons fall around her feet
so put a candle in the window
and a kiss upon his lips
as the dish outside the window fills with rain
just like a stranger with the weeds in your heart
and pay the fiddler off till i come back again
and it's time time time
and it's time time time
and it's time time time
that you love
and it's time time time
it's time time time
and it's time time time
and it's time time time
that you love
and it's time time...time
