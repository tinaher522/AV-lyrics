<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Crucify">
Every finger in the room is pointing at me
I wanna spit in their faces, then I get afraid what that could bring
I got a bowling ball in my stomach, I got a desert in my mouth
Figures that my courage would choose to sell out now
I've been looking for a savior in these dirty streets
Looking for a savior beneath these dirty sheets
I've been raising up my hands, drive another nail in
Just what God needs, one more victim
Why do we crucify ourselves? Well, every day
I crucify myself and nothing I do is good enough for you
I crucify myself every day
I crucify myself
And my heart is sick of being
I said my heart is sick of being
In chains, oh, chains, oh
Got a kick for a dog, beggin' for love
I gotta have my suffering, so that I can have my cross
I know a cat named Easter, but he says, "Will you ever learn?
You're just an empty cage, girl, if you kill the bird."
I've been looking for a savior in these dirty streets
Looking for a savior beneath these dirty sheets
I've been raising up my hands, drive another nail in
Got enough guilt to start my own religion
Why do we crucify ourselves? Every day
I crucify myself and nothing I do is good enough for you
I crucify myself every day
I crucify myself
My heart is sick of being
I said my heart is sick of being
In chains, oh, chains, oh
Please, please, please, save me
I cry, ah, ah
Looking for a savior in these dirty streets
Looking for a savior beneath these dirty sheets
I've been raising up my hands, drive another nail in
Where are those angels when you need them?
Why do we crucify ourselves? Every day
I crucify myself and nothing I do is good enough for you
I crucify myself every day
I crucify myself
My heart is sick of being
I said my heart is sick of being
In chains, oh, chains, oh
Why do we, oh, chains (Why do we crucify ourselves?)
Crucify ourselves everyday? (Why do we crucify ourselves?)
(Why do we crucify ourselves?) Oh, chains, oh, why? Yeah
(Why do we crucify ourselves?) Yeah, chains, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
(Why do we crucify ourselves?) Never going back again, oh
To crucify myself again, you know
(Why do we crucify ourselves?) Never going back again
To crucify myself everyday
