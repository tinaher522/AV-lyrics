Way to go Mister Microphone
Show us all what you don't know
Centuries secret societies
He's our commander still
Space dog
So sure we were on something
Your feet are finally on the ground, he said
So sure we were on something
Your feet are just on the ground, girl
Rain and snow, our engines have
Been receiving your eager call
There's Colonel Dirtyfishydishcloth
He'll distract her good, don't worry so
And to the one you thought was on your side
She can't understand, she truly believes the lie
Lemon pie
He's coming through
Our commander still
Space dog
Lines secure
Space dog
Deck the halls, I'm young again, I'm you again
Racing turtles, the grapefruit is winning
Seems I keep getting this story twisted
So where's Neil when you need him?
Deck the halls, it's you again, it's you again
Somewhere someone must know the ending
Is she still pissing in the river now
Heard she'd gone, moved into a trailer park
Voice 1:
So sure we were on something
Your feet are finally on the ground, he said
So sure we were onto something
Your feet are just on the ground, girl
So sure we were on something
Your feet are finally on the ground, he said
So sure we were on something
Your feet are just on the ground
Voice 2:
So sure those girls are in the Navy
Those bombs our friends can't even hurt you now
And hold those tears 'cause they're still on your side
Don't hear the dogs barking
Don't say you know we've gone Andromeda
Stood with those girls before
The hair in pairs, it just got nasty, well
And now those girls are gone
