<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Way_Down">
Maybe I'm the afterglow
'Cause I'm with the band you know
Don't you hear the laughter on the way down
Yes I am the anchorman
Dining here with son of Sam
A hair too much to chat of on the way down
Going to meet a great big star
Going to drive his great big car
Going to have it all here on the way down
The way down, the way down
She knows, let's go
Way down, the way down
The way down, she knows
