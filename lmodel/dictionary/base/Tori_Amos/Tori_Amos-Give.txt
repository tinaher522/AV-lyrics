<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Give">
So you heard
I crossed over the line
Do I have regrets?
Well, not yet
There are some
Some who give blood
I give love
I give
Soon before the sun
Before the sun begins to rise
I know that I, I must give
So that I, I can live
There are some
Some whose give
Twists itself to take
They mistake
Who, what
What made up the line?
Some say it was pain
Or was it shame?
Soon before the sun
Before the sun begins to rise
I know that I, I must give
So that I, I can live
Some
Some who give blood
I give love
I give
Soon before the sun
Before the sun begins to rise
I know that I, I must give
So that I, I can live
