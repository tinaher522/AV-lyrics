<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Bug_A_Martini">
Bug a Martini
Send me to Moscow
Lounge and return
Echo can't hear you
And as you wander
Through perfume and pathways
Your version, 'coercion'
My version, elixir of quietude
Line up the dots
Music to spy to
Music to die to
Spanking your lime
Over the crushed ice
Using the Triad
To countermeasure
You can't see my face
Dead letter box please
Your version, 'coercion'
My version, elixir of quietude
Line up the dots
Music to spy to
Music to die to
Bug a Martini
Send me to Moscow
Bug a Martini
Send me to Moscow
Bug a Martini
Send me to Moscow
Send me to Moscow
