<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Our_New_Year">
Glasses raised we all say, "Cheers"
Could this be the one? Our new year
Even after all this time
I don't know why, why you went away
Lately I'm sure it's you there waving
In the distance, closer, the closer I get
Disappointment tears, yes, it tears
They just have the same color of your hair
You're not there
You're not there
Every corner that I turn
I've convinced myself one day you'll be there
Choruses of "Auld Lang Syne"
Could this be the year, yours and mine?
Lately I'm sure it's you there waving
In the distance, closer, the closer I get
Disappointment tears, yes, it tears
They just have the same colour of your hair
You're not there, you're not there
You're not there, you're not there
You're not there, you're not there
You're not there, you're not there
Glasses raised we all say, "Cheers"
Could this be the one?
This could be the one
Could this be the one? Our new year
