<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Tombigbee">
To you it's another day
To me it's a grim reaping
Just another shooting star
Strung out on your wire
Prick my finger
On his virgin silver
He took me raw, ginger
Caramelize me
Tombigbee, Tombigbee, help me hang these bones
Got to hang these bones out to dry
He loved me, he loved me, ravishingly low
Gonna hang these bones out to dry
Dry, dry, dry
Got a blackberry stain
And they're not even in season
If you're not yet a woman
You got no business playing this
Tombigbee, Tombigbee, help me hang these bones
Got to hang these bones out to dry
He loved me, he loved me, ravishingly low
Got to hang these bones out to dry
Dry, dry, dry
So you get done then you get some
Sure enough it won't hold you for long
Then you say, "Right. This is all mine."
But hasn't your donor card expired?
From Blueridge to Cattail on the prairie 
From fly over country, back through Mississippi
I said, "Go." Man you go
But you raise me twenty, I'm raising you five-
Hundred treaties signed by your fathers' lies
Go, man, you go
'Cause I'm trailing her tears
The ones you won't hold
You roll me a carpet, roll me a carpet, boy
Roll me a carpet from here to Oklahoma
Tombigbee, Tombigbee, help me hang these bones
Got to hang these bones out to dry
He loved me, he loved me, ravishingly low
Got to hang these bones out to dry
Dry, dry, dry
I'll do it again
Dry, dry, dry, dry
