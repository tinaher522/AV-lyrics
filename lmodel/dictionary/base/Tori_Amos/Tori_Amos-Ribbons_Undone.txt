<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Ribbons_Undone">
She's a girl
Rising from a shell
Running to spring
It is her time
It is her time
Watch her run
With ribbons undone
She's a rose (she's a rose)
In a lily's cloak
She can hide her charms
It is her right
There will be time
To chase the sun
With ribbons undone
She runs like a fire does
Just picking up daisies
Comes in for a landing
A pure flash of lightning
Past Alice Blue Blossoms
You follow her laughter
And then she'll surprise you
Arms filled with lavender
Yes, my little pony
Is growing up fast
She corrects me and says
"You mean a thoroughbred"
A look in her eyes says
The battle's beginning
From school
She comes home and cries
I don't want to grow up, Mom
At least not tonight
You're a girl
Rising from a shell
Running through spring
With summer's hand in reach now
It is your time
It is your time
So just run
With ribbons undone
It is your time, yes, my angel
It is your time
So just run
With ribbons undone
Ooh
Run, run, darling
Ooh, ooh
Ribbons un
