<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Bliss">
Father I killed my monkey
I let it out to taste the sweet of spring
Wonder if I will wander out
Test my tether to see if I'm still free from you
Steady as it comes right down to you
I've said it all
So maybe we're a bliss of another kind I said
A bliss of another kind I said
Lately I'm in to circuitry
What it means to be
Made of you but not enough of you
And I wonder if you can bilocate
Is that what I taste
Your supernova juice?
You know it's true
I'm a part of you
Steady as it comes right down to you
I've said it all
So maybe we're a bliss of another kind I said
Steady as it comes right down to you
I've said it all
So maybe you're a four horse engine with a power drive, I said
A hot kachina who wants into mine, I said
Take it, take it with your terra- terracide
And I said steady as it comes right down to you
I've said it all
So maybe we're a bliss of another kind I said
A bliss of another kind I said
A bliss of another kind I said
A bliss of
A bliss of
A bliss of
A bliss of another kind
