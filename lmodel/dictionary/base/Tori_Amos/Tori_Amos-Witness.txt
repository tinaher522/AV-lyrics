<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Witness">
I thought I had a witness
A-come on, come on, come on
I thought I had a witness
Come on, come on, come on
I thought I had a witness to this crime
I thought I had a witness
I thought we were on the same side
Of becoming then the judges
Called in a witness
A-come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
So then when did you then begin your craving for white powder
Exotic matter that cells divide, arresting time
So in your furnace then you drank my tenderness
Feldspar and Mica then you thought that you would own my temple of gold
Got to rise in the night
Pick myself off the floor
I know now that it's over
I had a life before
You left me burning in
Your petrol emotion, boy
Your petrol emotion
Wanting more
A-come on, come on, come on
I thought I had a witness
Come on, come on, come on
I thought we had a friendship
A-come on, come on, come on
I thought I heard you whispering murder
I thought this witches brew was more than bulletproof
But words are like guns when you shoot the moon
'Cause everybody whispers, yeah
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
So then when did you then begin your craving for white powder
Exotic matter that cells divide, arresting time
So in your furnace then you drank my tenderness
Feldspar and Mica then you thought that you would own my temple of gold
Got to rise in the night
Pick myself off the floor, girls
I know now that it's over
I had a life before
You left me burning in
Your petrol emotion
Your petrol emotion
Wanting more
Is there anyone? Is it any wonder?
Is there anyone? Is it any wonder, baby?
Is there anyone? Is it any wonder?
I'm out the door
I'm out the door now
Is there any way? Is there any way forward?
Is there any way? Is there any way forward?
Is there anyone? Is it any wonder?
I thought I had a witness
I thought you were you
I thought I was a witness
You could turn to not in
I thought I had a witness
I thought I did
I thought I had a witness
Come on, come on, come on
I thought I had a witness
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on
Hit it, boys
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come
