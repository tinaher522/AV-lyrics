<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="In_The_Springtime_Of_His_Voodoo">
Hey, hey, you
Keep walking, keep walking by
Hey
Let me watch you
Walk down, just keep on 
Watching, yeah
And me, yeah
Standing on a corner in Winslow, Arizona
And I'm quite sure I'm in the wrong song
Two girls, sixty five
Got a piece tied up in the back seat
"Honey, we're Recovering Christians"
In the springtime of his voodoo
He was going to show me spring
And right there for a minute
I knew you so well
And right there for a minute
I knew you so well
Got an angry snatch, girls, you know what I mean
When swiveling that hip doesn't do the trick
Me pureed sanitarily Mister Sulu
Warp speed, warp speed, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, hey
In the springtime of his voodoo
In the springtime of his voodoo, hey
Every road leads back to my door
Every road I will follow
Every road leads back to my door
Got all crosses loaded
 And right there for a minute
   I knew you so well
   And right there for a minute
   I knew
And I know she's not that foxy, boys yes
I said I know she's not that foxy but
You got to owe something sometimes
You got to owe, boys, when you're your momma's sunshine
You've got to give something sometimes
When you're the sweetest cherry in the apple pie
I need some voodoo on these prunes
In the spring time of his voodoo
In the spring time of his voodoo
Yes, he, he was going to show me spring
