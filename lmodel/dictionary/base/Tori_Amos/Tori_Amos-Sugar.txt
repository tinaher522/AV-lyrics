<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Sugar">
Don't say morning's come
Don't say it's up to me
If I could take twenty five minutes
Out of the record books
Sugar, he brings me sugar
Bobby's collecting bees
And hammers, he used one on me
Cold war with little boys
Get in with a bubble gum trade and
Sugar, bring me sugar
I know the robins bring
Bring me many things but
Sugar, he brings me sugar
As far as I can tell
I've been gone for miles now
And you know and I know
I don't know me very well
And I know and we know
If they found me out
Sugar, he brings me sugar
And all the robins bring
They bring me many things but
Sugar, he brings me sugar
And all the robins bring
They bring many things but
Sugar, oh Sugar
Sugar, hey Sugar
Sugar
You
