<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="The_Power_Of_Orange_Knickers">
The power of orange knickers
The power of orange knickers
The power of orange knickers
Under my petticoat
The power of listening to what
You don't want me to know
Can somebody tell me now
Who is this terrorist?
Those girls that smile kindly
Then rip your life to pieces
Can somebody tell me now
Am I alone with this?
This little pill in my hand
And with this secret kiss, kiss
Am I alone in this?
A matter of complication
When you become a twist
For their latest drink
As they're transitioning
Can somebody tell me now
Who is this terrorist?
This little pill in my hand
That keeps the pain living
Can somebody tell me now
A way out of this?
That sacred pipe of red stone
Could blow me out of this kiss, kiss
Am I alone in this?
The power of orange knickers
Under my petticoat
The power of listening to what
You don't want me to know
Shame, shame, time to leave me now
Shame, shame, you've had your fun
Shame, shame, for letting me think
That I would be the one
Can somebody tell me now
Who is this terrorist?
This little pill in my hand
Or this secret kiss, kiss
Am I alone in this?
Kiss, kiss
Am I alone in this?
Kiss, kiss
