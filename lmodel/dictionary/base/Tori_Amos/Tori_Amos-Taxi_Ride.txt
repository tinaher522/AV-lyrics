<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Taxi_Ride">
Lily is dancing on the table
We've all been pushed too far
I guess on days like this
You know who your friends are
Just another dead fag to you that's all
Just another light missing
On a long taxi ride, taxi ride
And I'm down to your last cigarette
And this "we are one" crap as you're invading
This thing you call love
She smiles way too much but
I'm glad you're on my side, sure
I'm glad you're on my side, still
You think you deserve a trust fund
Just because you want one
Sure you talk the talk when you need to
I fear the whole world is starting to believe you
Just another dead fag to you that's all
Just another light missing
In a long taxi line, taxi line
And I'm down to your last cigarette
And this "we are one" crap as you're invading
This thing you call love
She smiles way too much but
I'm glad you're on my side, sure
I'm glad you're on my side, still
Lily is dancing on the table
We've all been pushed too far today
Even a glamorous bitch can be in need
This is where you know the honey from the killer bees
I'm glad you're on my side, sure
I'm glad you're on my side, sure
I'm glad you're on my side, still
Got a long taxi ride
Got a long taxi ride
