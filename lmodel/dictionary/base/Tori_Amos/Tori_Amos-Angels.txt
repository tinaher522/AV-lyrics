<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Angels">
And with a wink and a smile you toss your instructions on
How to catch a train while it's moving
You always were the one that kept us all guessing
How you could survive the fall you had
From medicine men to my DJ friends
They all have said, "He's got to watch his back."
They're trapping angels by the Potomac
But it's not how you think, you'd be surprised
They liberate your dreamscape
Till you can't remember to recall
Where your wings have gone
Tell me where they've gone
From Jordan to Chicago another child is born
Trusting that we'll get it right this time
I should've worn my glasses, you said just to trust
Then you chose to sign the dotted line
From modern Magdalenes to my DJ friends
They all have said, "He's got to watch his back."
They're trapping angels by the Potomac
But it's not how you think, you'd be surprised
They liberate your dreamscape
Till you can't remember to recall
Where your wings have gone
Before I close my eyes at night
I can still see you smiling
Before the truth was buried alive
Did we prize it
Before you change the world
Maybe, boy, you should change your girl
They're trapping angels by the Potomac
They're trapping angels, Lord, I know this
They're trapping angels by the Potomac
But we're getting closer now
I said we're getting closer
To where they've gone
Tell me where they've gone
Tell me where they've gone
Now it won't be long
