<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Fayth">
Make it in the city, do what you can
Wave to the boy with a gun in his hand, hey
Lollipop girls pave the streets
Stand in line to be in your limousine
You took my love, you took my money, you took my sex
You took my love, you took my money, give me
Fayth
Help me keep  myself together
With a little more fayth
With a little more fayth, yeah
Fayth
I could keep our love together
With a little more fayth
I could wake up and face the day
Well, how do you keep the romance there
When a little french maid lives downstairs
Radio blasts as the baby cries
Run to the dragon that runs my life
You took my love, you took my money, you took my sex
You took my love, you took my money, give me
Fayth
Help me keep myself together
With a little more fayth
With a little more fayth, yeah
Fayth
I could keep our love together
With a little more fayth
I could wake up and face the day
I could wake up and face the day
Maybe I could start again (start again)
Why am I afraid of change?
Maybe fayth could understand
Darling, I remember when (I remember when)
I held the violets in my hand
Love can crush held too tight
We could bring it back alive
With a little more fayth
Fayth, yeah babe
I could keep our love together
With a little more fayth
With a little more fayth, yeah baby
Fayth, yeah baby, oh baby
Little more, little more
Yeah baby
I could keep our love together
Together baby
Together babe, ooh
Fayth
