<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Iieee">
With your E's and your ease
And I do one more
Need a lip gloss boost
In your America
Is it God's? Is it yours?
Sweet saliva
With your E's and your ease 
And I do one more
And I know we're dying
And there's no sign of a parachute
We scream in cathedrals
Why can't it be beautiful?
Why does there got to be a sa- sa- sacrifice?
Got to be a sa- sa- sacrifice?
Just say yes you little arsonist
You're so sure you can save every hair on my chest
Just say yes you little arsonist
With your E's and your ease
And I do one more
With your E's and your ease
And I do one more
Well, I know we're dying
And there's no sign of a parachute
In this chapel, little chapel of love
Can't we get a little grace and some elegance?
No, we scream in cathedrals
Why can't it be beautiful?
Why does there got to be a sa- sa- sacrifice?
Got to be a sa- sa- sacrifice?
Got to be a sa- sa- sacrifice?
