<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Dolphin_Song">
Matthew bring in your fishing nets
Have you caught yourself a woman
Caught yourself a woman yet
Sometimes you call me Melusine
After the Lady of the Fountain
In whose lake you took the drink
And, boy, I know, I know that you burn
For your water spirit
Now that know, I know the lengths that you'd go
To chase the roughest tide that's right behind me
Yes, I know, I know the lengths that you'd go
To bring the roughest tide in smooth like dolphin
Smooth like dolphin
I sought shelter in our child's room
She and me against the world, safe in our cocoon
You raced a giant roller-skate
And said, "The three of us must leave this place
Song lines will guide our way"
And, boy, I know, I know that you burn
For your water spirit
Now that know, I know the lengths that you'd go
To chase the roughest tide that's right behind me
Yes, I know, I know the lengths that you'd go
To bring the roughest tide in smooth like dolphin
Smooth like dolphin
Matthew bring in your fishing nets
I have been marked by your gospel
This daughter of a preacher man
â€˜Cause boy I feel, I feel that you burn
For your water spirit
I said that boy, I feel, feel that you burn
for your water girl
Now that I know, I know the lengths that you'd go
To bring the tide that's racing right behind me
Yes, I know, I know the lengths that you'd go
To bring the roughest tide in smooth like dolphin
Smooth like dolphin
Smooth like dolphin
Smooth like dolphin
