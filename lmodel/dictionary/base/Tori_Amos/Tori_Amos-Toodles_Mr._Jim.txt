<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Toodles_Mr._Jim">
Hey yes
I said, yes
I said, hurray yay yay yippy yay
I said, diddly hey and
Toodles Mister Jim you cherry picker
Toodles I say so long
Hear that your grave's a little warm you stickler
Sing them all your happy song
It's today
Today Sunday
By your grave
I say toodles Mister Jim you cherry picker
Taught me so well
How to spell those red in hey
You know she deserved that nose
Splattered and swattered blood in my hands
Not a nice day for your little girl
But you came to my aid instead
Now, now it's toodles Mister Jim you cherry picker
Build that ladder well
Teach me just where those boys can climb
When they've got a spell
Toodles Mister Jim you are my sweet favourite neighbor
Of them all of them
Girls go to their parties
I don't care 'cause I'm with you still
That was Toodles Mister Jim
Mister Jim died two weeks ago
And he taught me how to pick cherries
And I punched his daughter in the nose
Because she was mean
Mister Jim was good
