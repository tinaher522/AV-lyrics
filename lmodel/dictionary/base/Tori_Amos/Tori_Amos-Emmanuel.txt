<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Emmanuel">
O come, O come, Emmanuel
And ransom captive Israel
That mourns in lonely exile here
Until the son of God appear
Rejoice, Rejoice, Emmanuel
Shall come to thee, O Israel
Long ago the earth lay sleeping
Waiting for the darkest night
To bring with it the dove of peace
Rising on the wings, wings of the sun
Rising on the wings of the sun
O come, O come, thou dayspring bright
Pour on our souls thy healing light
Dispel the long nights lingering gloom
And pierce the shadows of the tomb
Rejoice, Rejoice, Emmanuel
Shall come to thee, O Israel
Rejoice, Rejoice, Emmanuel
Shall come to thee, O Israel
