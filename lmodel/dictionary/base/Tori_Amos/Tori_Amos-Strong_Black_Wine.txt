<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Strong_Black_Wine">
Nobody knows my Cherokee origins
I never speak about this
My Cherokee grandma told me
The love for the earth just gives good fruits
And the vine is the plant of genus vitis
As the grape plants
She said "take a vine
And drink so much wine
Remember if red it's mine
You know just drunk I'm fine
Take a strong black vine
And you'll drink good red wine
The sun is big and yellow
While I'm drinking my good brunello
She said "take a vine
And drink so much wine
Remember if red it's mine
You know just drunk I'm fine
Thank you strong black vine
Under you I sing time, time, time"
Someone thinks the last rhymes have not a logic sense
I'd like to see you
After you've drunk all the wine in an evening
Like my friend Albano
Living in Cellino San Marco,
He has a such strong black vine
Take a strong black vine
Just drunk I'm fine
You have to say girls
Just drunk you'll be fine
So drunk
So drunk
