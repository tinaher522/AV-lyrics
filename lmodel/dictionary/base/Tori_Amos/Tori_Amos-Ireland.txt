Driving in my Saab
On my way to Ireland
It's been a long time
It's been a long time
Driving with my friends
On my way to Ireland
It's been a long time
It's been a long time
So when I was out in the desert
And a cowboy tried to lasso me
He said you're red and made of clay, a virgin portrait
I let him wake me but decided not to stay
Driving in my Saab
On my way to Ireland
It's been a long time
It's been a long time
Driving with my friends
On my way to Ireland
It's been a long time
It's been a long time
Next in New York I fell out with a dragon
Of the white collar kind but just as ferocious
I remembered Macha running faster than the horses
Then an encounter with a voice that caressed me
Driving in my Saab
On my way to Ireland
It's been a long time
A long time
Driving with my friends
On my way to Ireland
It's been a long time
A long time
Wasn't it you who held off a surrender
To one spoiled nun who taught you the names
Of the mountains on the moon and then a Jesuit
Proceeded to arrange your soul while I prayed on my knees
Driving in my Saab
On my way to Ireland
It's been a long time
A long time
Driving with my friends, yes
On my way to Ireland
It's been a long time
A long time
Such a long, long time
It's been a long time
A long time
