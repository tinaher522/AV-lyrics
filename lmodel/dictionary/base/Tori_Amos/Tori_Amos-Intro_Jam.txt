<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Intro_Jam">
Back that arse up now, back it on up
Back it on up now, I feel it's on something good
Back me up, boys, feel that you're there now
Feel that you're there, just there in my back here, and I said
When it's down I know it's down
I know when it's light out and it's up
And when it's down you know it's down
I said I need to know what's up
When it's down you know it's down now
Someone to return now
I don't even know but I feel it in my heart
Back it on up, boy, back me on up
I'm going to face the dark, man, just back me on up
He's white as a ghost with a tie and a suit
He thinks that he's got me on the corner of his shoe
Just back me on up, boys, back me on up
I know when I'm down but I don't know what's up
So back me on up, boys, back me on up
And by the time this is over I'll see the sun
Come on
When it's around and I know the town
And I think I know every way out
And I think I know where I get to
I'm giving myself up to you now
Some kind of faith
Some kind of faith that you
Just back me on, back me on and
Back me on up, boys, back me on up
They say I don't know when things are up
But I know what's down 'cause I live there you know
And I think it's pretty 'cause I see the soul
Of backing on up, girls, back me on up
I like it on earth, I like it in the dirt
Oh and my feet get my heels pretty
I know that it snows like oh roses
Back me on up, boys, back me on up
I've got to face some kind of evil tomorrow
I need to know that you're going to be there
And you know my faith is in your hands now
Just back me on up
Just back me on up
Back me on up
