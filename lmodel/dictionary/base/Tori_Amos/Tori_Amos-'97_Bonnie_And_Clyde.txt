Baby, your da-da loves you
And I'm always gonna be here for you
No matter what happens
You're all I got in this world
I'd never give you up for nothin'
Nobody in this world is ever gonna keep you from me
I love you
Come on, hey hey, We going to the beach
Grab a couple of toys, and let da-da strap you in the car seat
Where's mama? She's taking a little nap in the trunk
Oh! That smell; da-da musta runned over a skunk
Now I know what you're thinking; it's kinda late to go swimming
But you know your mama; she's one of those type of women
That do crazy things, and if she don't get her way, she'll throw a fit
Don't play wit da-da's toy knife honey, let go of it
And don't look so upset, why you acting bashful
Don't you wanna help da-da build a sand castle?
And mama said she wants to show you how far she can float
Don't worry about that little boo-boo on her throat
It's just a little scratch, it don't hurt
Her was eating dinner while you were sweepin'
And spilt ketchup on her shirt
Mama's messy, isn't she?
We'll let her wash off in the water
And me and you can play by ourselves, can't we?
Just the two of us
Just the two of us
Just the two of us
Just the two of us
See honey, there's a place called heaven and a place called hell
There's a placed called prison and a place called jail
And da-da's probably on his way to all of 'em, except one
'Cause mama's got a new husband and a stepson
And you don't want a brother, do ya?
Maybe when you're old enough to understand a little better
I'll explain it to you
But for now, we'll just say mama was real, real bad
She was being mean to dad and made him real, real mad
But I still feel sad that I put her on timeout
Sit back in your chair honey, quit trying to climb out
I told you it's okay, hey hey, you wanna bah-bah
Take a night-night
Na-na-goo-goo gah-gah
Her make coo-coo-cocka
Dad'll change your di-ey
Clean the baby up, so I can take a nighty-nighty
Your dad'll wake her up as soon as we get to the water
97' Bonnie &amp; Clyde, me and my daughter
Me and my daughter
Me and my daughter
Just the two of us
Just the two of us
Just the two of us
Just the two of us
Wake up sweepy head, we're here
Before we play,
We're gonna take mommy for a wittle walk along the pier
Baby, don't cry honey, don't get the wrong idea
Mama's too sweepy to hear you screaming in her ear
That's why you can't get her to wake
But don't worry,
Da-da made a nice bed for mommy at the bottom of the lake
Here, you wanna help da-da tie a rope around this rock?
We'll tie it to her footsy, then we'll roll her off the dock
Ready now? Here we go, on the count of three
1, 2, three, weee
There goes mama, spwashing in the water
No more fighting with dad, no more restraining order
No more step da-da, no more brotha
Blow her kisses buh-bye, tell mommy you love her
Now we'll go play in the sand, build a sand castle and junk
But first, just help dad with two more things out the trunk
Just the two of us
