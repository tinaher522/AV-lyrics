<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="The_Wrong_Band">
I think it's perfectly clear
We're in the wrong band
Ginger is always sincere
Just not to one man
She called me up and she said
You know that I'm drowning
It's the dog trainer again
He says that he thinks that she needs more hands
I think it's perfectly clear
We're in the wrong band
Senator, let's be sincere
As much as you can
He called her up and he said
The new prosecutor
Soon will be wanting a word
So she's got a soft spot for heels and spurs
And there's something believing
In her voice again
Said there's something believing
Instead of just leaving
Instead of just leaving
Instead of just leaving
And she gets her cigars from the sweet fat man
I think it's perfectly clear
We're in the wrong band
Heidi says she'll be sincere
As much as she can
I called her up and I said
You know that I'm drowning
Put on your raincoat again
'Cause even the sun's got a price on it
And there's something believing
In her voice again
Said there's something believing
Instead of just leaving
Instead of just leaving
Instead of just leaving
She said it's time I open my eyes
Don't be afraid to open your eyes
Maybe she's right
Maybe she's right
Maybe she's right
Maybe she's right
