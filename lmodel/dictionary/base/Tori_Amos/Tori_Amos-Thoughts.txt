<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Thoughts">
Thoughts right now
I picked up a magazine
Oh, here they go
Fifteen hundred years
Fifteen hundred years right here
Oh, burning witches, burning books
Burning babies in their looks
Yes, indeed
Burning everything that's sacred in my genes
Thoughts right now
She's been everybody else's girl
Thoughts right now
Thoughts right now
Right, right now
Am I here
Oh am I here 
I'm never here
I'm never here
I'm never here
I am never, never a bird
In the flower in the tree
In the pain of the respect thereof
Yes, indeed
Thoughts right now
What will become of me
Become of her
Become of we, babe, yeah
