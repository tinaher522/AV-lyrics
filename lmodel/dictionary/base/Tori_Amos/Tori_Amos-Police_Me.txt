<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Police_Me">
Police yourself
Police yourself
Police me
Police yourself
Police yourself
Police me
We've got our own remote viewing
Every cell has been taught to think
Perhaps the answer to the question
Lies in the question
Perhaps you should read my thoughts
Line them up like soldiers
Police yourself
Police yourself
Police me
Loaded, full of winter you are
Storming Blackberry girl
Will you strike before he's
Loaded, full of winter you are
Storming Blackberry girl
Will you strike before he's
Loaded, full of winter you are
Storming Blackberry girl
Will you strike before he's
Loaded, full of winter you are
Police yourself
Police yourself
Police me
Police yourself
Can they monitor how you think?
Police yourself
They've got their own remote viewing
Police yourself
To get off he cries "slutty goth"
Police yourself
But I'm a brightly colored person
Police me
Loaded, full of winter you are
Storming Blackberry girl
Will you strike before he's
Loaded, full of winter you are
Storming Blackberry girl
Will you strike before he's
Loaded, full of winter you are
Storming Blackberry girl
Will you strike before he's
Loaded, full of winter you are
Perhaps the answer to the question
Lies in the question
Perhaps you should read my thoughts
Line them up like soldiers
Perhaps the answer to the question
Lies in the question
Perhaps you should read my thoughts
Line them up like soldiers
Police yourself
Police yourself
Police me
Police yourself
Police yourself
Police me
