<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Fast_Horse">
How can I be drunk?
You strike with dry poison
I am possessed
Still engaged in some kind of advanced shackling
Girl, you got to find you the man
Who can smoke this out, bad medicine
Girl, you got to find you the man
Who can smoke this out, good medicine would say—
You got you a fast horse, darlin'
But all you do is complain it ain't a Maserati
You had a soul that you left back in Memphis
But your mama ain't New York she is pure Tennessee
On a desert highway
I am struck by my own rage
Time bomb in his palm a finger-apple
Augments this advanced shackling
Girl, you got to find you the man
Who can smoke this out, bad medicine
Girl, you got to find you the man
Who can smoke this out, good medicine would say—
You got you a fast horse, darlin'
But all you do is complain it ain't a Maserati
You had a soul that you left back in Memphis
But your mama ain't New York she is pure, can't you see
You got you a fast horse, darlin'
But all you do is complain it ain't a Maserati
You had a soul that you left back in Memphis
But your mama ain't New York she is pure, can't you see
Your mama ain't New York
She is pure Tennessee
