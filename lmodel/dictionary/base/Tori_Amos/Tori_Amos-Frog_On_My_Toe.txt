<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Frog_On_My_Toe">
Papa, I know
There's a frog on my toe
Maybe I'll call him Jethro
Maybe I'll grow up to be quite as good as he
And maybe you'll come back after you're long gone
And papa I'm sure
The worms have eaten you now
And Jethro's been on some Frenchy's plate long ago
And now I'm pretty sure
That I listen to every word
'Cause I still hear you telling me still
Slap them boys when they're naughty
Make 'em crawl, make you haughty
Make a strong little girl
You paint them toes the reddish colour
And you know one day
You're going to be bigger than a flea
You're going to be bigger than that old
Poison ivy tree
Now I'm pretty sure
That I think you come and visit
And talk sometimes kind of like Gidget
And in funny little chants like an Indian Brave
You said we all grew fat when the old white man came
But one day girl
you're going to learn to make them crawl
Make them grow tall but have the grace
To be a lady with disgrace
And you fry them taters
And you make them with lady's hands
And I know you're my pappy's baby
