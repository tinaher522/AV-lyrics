<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Wild_Way">
I hate you
I hate you
I do
I hate that
You're the one who can
Make me feel gorgeous
With just just a flick of your finger
It is that easy
Yes there was a time
You didn't always get your way
Back there where my heart
Was not so easy to invade
When my battlements were strong
Before the pilgrims came
Don't forget you were the one
Who loved my wild way
I hate you
I hate you
I do
I hate that
I turn into a kind
Some kind of monster
With just just a flick of your finger
It is that easy
Of course there was a time
You didn't always get your way
Back there where my heart
Was not so easy to invade
When my battlements were strong
Before the pilgrims came
Don't forget you were the one
Who loved my wild way
I hate you
I hate you
I do
I hate that
You're the one who can
Make me feel gorgeousâ€¨
With just just a flick of your finger
It is that easy
To hate you
To hate you
