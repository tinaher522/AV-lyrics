<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Heart_Attack_At_23">
I don't know why I did it
Took the keys to my brother's car
Why should I hang around here any more?
Hey, just to put my foot to the floor, yeah
Sirens wake me up
Wake me up with a cry
Things we do for attention
Just a little reminder, dear
I am still alive, huh
So confused
I almost threw it all away for you
Well, you took me higher
And you dropped me lower
Than I've ever been before
If I have a heart attack at twenty three
I'm loving you too much
If I have a heart attack at twenty three
Wave bye-bye
You'll miss me
You'll miss me, baby
If I have a heart attack at twenty three
All, all my friends, yeah
We waste so much love on our men
Why can't I be forgiving
While he's been out a-messing
With his Argentine baby
If I have a heart attack at twenty three
I'm loving you too much
If I have a heart attack at twenty three
Wave bye-bye
You'll miss me
You'll miss me, baby
If I have a heart attack
I must be dreaming
We were together
In a land of scarlet ribbon
That tied you to me, darling
(Roll, roll, roll, roll on)
But you know I'm never satisfied
(Roll, roll, roll, roll on)
With all the good things in my life
(Roll, roll, roll, roll on)
I thought I needed you to be strong
(Roll, roll, roll, roll on)
I'll still miss you when I'm gone
If I have a heart attack at twenty three
I'm loving you too much
If I have a heart attack at twenty three
Wave bye-bye, baby
If I have a heart attack at twenty three
If I have a heart attack at twenty three, babe
If I have a heart attack, baby
I'm loving, loving you too much, yeah
Hey
Wave bye-bye, babe
Bye-bye baby, yeah
I'm loving, loving you too much, hey
Twenty three, hey
I, you'll miss me baby
You'll miss me when I'm gone
Wave bye-bye, babe
Wave bye-bye, baby
I'm loving, loving you too
Too much, babe
Too much, babe
