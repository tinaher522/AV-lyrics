<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="New_Age">
Waiting for the phone to ring
Diamond necklace on my shoulder
Waiting for the phone to ring
Lipstick on my naked shoulder
It seems to be my fancy
To make it with Frank and Nancy, when
Over the bridge we go
Looking for love
Over the bridge we go
Looking for love
I'll come running to you
Oh baby if you want me
I, I'll come running to you now
Baby if you want me
Looking at my hands today
Look to me that they're made of ivory
I had a funny call today
Someone died and someone married
You know that it's my fancy
To make it with Frank and Nancy when
Over the bridge they go
Looking for love
Over the bridge we go
Looking for love
I'll come running to you now
Baby if you want me
I, I'll come running to you
Baby if you want me
I'll come running to you now
Baby if you want me
I, I'll come running to you
Baby if you want me
Something's got a hold on me
It's the beginning of the new age
Oh you know I heard that it was
It's the beginning of a new age
Can you sing a tune for yourselves?
Yes, it's the beginning of the new age
All you little sick little fucks
Yes, it's the beginning of the new age
