<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Walking_With_You">
Every night I sit alone
Waiting to see you at my door
Arriving at the usual time
Waiting to share your love with mine
Well, I've waited a lifetime just to find you
But you have to believe in successes you're seeking
Then in a few months you can come home to me
It's the job that you need
It's the school that you have to complete
Gives you time to go on with your days
But I'll be waiting right here as I am
But before you leave
Make me a promise I need you to keep
Remember me while you're away
Think of me while you're alone
In everything that I do
I do it in twos
'Cause I'll always be walking with you
Remember me while you're away
Think of me while you're alone
In everything that I do
I do it in twos
'Cause I'll always be walking with you
By my side
Always be walking with you
In my mind
Always be walking
Always be walking with you
Facing another empty evening
A-lying alone here in my bed
You keep my mind from my job
But you lead my life with love
You hold my chin up high
Your love shines through my eyes
Your soul walks by my side
Keeping this body alive
As I run to catch the bus
I get a strange look or two
'Cause instead of just buying a ticket for me
I also buy a ticket for you
Now some people say I'm crazy
But its the only way not to feel blue
'Cause in everything that I do
I do it in twos
'Cause I'll always be walking with you, you, you
I'll always be, always be, always be, always be
I'll always be walking with you
Remember me while you're away
Think of me while you're alone
In everything that I do
I do it in twos
'Cause I'll always be walking with you
By my side
Always be walking with you
In my mind
Always be walking
Always be walking with you
