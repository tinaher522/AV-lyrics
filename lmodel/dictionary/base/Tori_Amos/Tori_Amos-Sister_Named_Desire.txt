<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Sister_Named_Desire">
Got a sister named Desire
They don’t let you light those little boys
By their house
On the backhand swing, yes
I know a Vicar who coughs a lot
I thought we told some little sweet stories
In the parking lot
They say the girl lost her sway
They say the girl lost her sway that day
God I’d like to drag him for a long way
‘Cause maybe I
Then I’d just cry a little tear near him
To that sleepy safe place
And I’m gonna take it by myself if I’ve got to go
Don’t let you, let you know where she goes to
With those, me as I interfere
They say the girl lost her sway
They say the girl lost her sway that day
Teach me about them old, old worlds big brother man
In an elevator where somebody can get out without sound
They say the girl lost her sway
Just watch it
Just watch it slip through my hands, boy
Watch it go, what you know
Hey, yes
I see, just see
'Cause she still can sway
