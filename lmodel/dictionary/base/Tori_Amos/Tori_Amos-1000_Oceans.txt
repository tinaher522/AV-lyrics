<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="1000_Oceans">
These tears I've cried
I've cried a thousand oceans 
And if it seems
I'm floating in the darkness
Well, I can't believe that I would keep 
Keep you from flying
And I would cry a thousand more
If that's what it takes
To sail you home
Sail you home
Sail you home
Sail you home
I'm aware what the rules are
But you know that I will run
You know that I will follow you
Over Silbury Hill
Through the solar field
You know that I will follow you
And if I find you
Will you still remember
Playing at trains
Or does this li- little blue ball just fade away
Over Silbury Hill
Through the solar field
You know that I will follow you
I'm aware what the rules are
But you know that I will run
You know that I will follow you
These tears I've cried
I've cried a thousand oceans
And if it seems
I'm floating in the darkness
Well, I can't believe that I would keep
Keep you from flying
So I will cry a thousand more
If that's what it takes
To sail you home
Sail you home
Sail you home
Sail, sail you home
