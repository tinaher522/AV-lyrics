<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Icicle">
Icicle, icicle, where are you going?
Where are you going?
Icicle, icicle, where are you going?
I have a hiding place when spring marches in...
Will you keep watch for me? I hear them calling...
Gonna lay down... 
Gonna lay down...
Greeting the monster in our Easter dresses...
Father says, "Bow your head, like the Good Book says."
Well, I think the Good Book is missing some pages...
Gonna lay down... 
Gonna lay down...
And when my hand touches myself, I can finally rest my head;
And when they say "Take of his body", I think I'll take from mine instead...
Getting off, getting off, while they're all downstairs;
Singing prayers - sing away - He's in my pumpkin PJs...
Lay your book on my chest:
"Feel the Word, feel the Word, 
Feel the Word, feel the Word,
Feel the Word... feel it..."
I could have, I should have;
I could have flown, you know, well...
I could have, I should have;
I didn't... so...
Icicle, icicle, where are you going?
I have a hiding place when spring marches in...
Will you keep watch for me? I hear them calling...
Gonna lay down... 
Gonna lay down...
Lay... down...
Gonna lay down.
