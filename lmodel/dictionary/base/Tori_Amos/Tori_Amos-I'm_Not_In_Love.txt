<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="I'm_Not_In_Love">
I'm not in love, so don't forget it
It's just a silly phase I'm going through
And just because I call you up
Don't get it wrong
Don't think you've got it made
I'm not in love, no no, it's because
Said, I'd like to see you, but then again 
It doesn't mean you mean that much to me 
So if I call you, don't make a fuss
Don't tell your friends about the two of us
I'm not in love, no, it's because
I keep your picture up on the wall
It hides a nasty stain still lying there
It hides a nasty stain still lying there
I keep your picture up on the wall
It hides a nasty stain still lying there
It hides a nasty stain still lying there
So don't you ask me to give it back
I know you know it doesn't mean that much to me
I'm not in love, it's because
Ooh, you'll wait a long time for me
Ooh, you'll wait a long time
Ooh, you'll wait a long time for me
Ooh, you'll wait a long time
I'm not in love so don't forget it
It's just a silly phase I'm going through
And just because I call you up
Don't get me wrong
Don't think you've gotten me
I'm not in love 
I'm not in love
