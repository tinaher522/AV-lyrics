<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Home_On_The_Range_(Cherokee_Edition)">
Oh give me a home
Where the buffalos roam
And the deer and the antelope play
Where seldom is heard
A discouraging word
And the skies are not cloudy all day
Home
Home on the range
Where the deer and the antelope play
Where seldom is heard
A discouraging word
And skies are not cloudy all day
Well, Jackson made deals
A thief down to his heels
Hello Trail of Tears
The Smokies could hide
A Cherokee bride
Her brave was shot yesterday
Home
Home on the range
Where the deer and the antelope play
Where seldom is heard
A discouraging word
And skies are not cloudy all day
We know it's not Caroline
Your home is your home
The range may be fine
For some but not in my eyes
Home
Home on the range
The smokies always hide
A cherokee bride
But in her eyes
We know it's not Caroline
America
America
Who discovered your ass?
The white man came
"This land is my land
This is your land" they sang
Home
Home on the range
Where the deer and the antelope play
Where seldom is heard
A discouraging word
And the skies are not cloudy all day
And the skies are not cloudy all day
And the skies are not cloudy all day
