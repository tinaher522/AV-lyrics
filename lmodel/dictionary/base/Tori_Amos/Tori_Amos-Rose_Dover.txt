If you see Rose Dover
That's her secret name
She would meet 3 others
To keep the forest safe
She says "my reality was soon called
Make Believe, imagination's funeral
Killed by the teenage me"
You don't have to throw it away
Throw being a kid away
Just because you're growing up
Faster every day
You don't have to throw it all away
You don't have to throw it all away
There's a way
I've been thinking lately it's not
A permanent situation
Just a phase that she's in
I've been thinking lately
I've been thinking lately
It's not permanent
A scattering of birds
Above her head
A scattering of birds
That whisper to her
"You don't have to throw it away
Throw being a kid away
Just because you're growing up
Faster every day
You don't have to throw it all away
There's a way”
Happy was Rose Dover
Speaking badger, fawn, rabbit 
(behind the lumberjacks)
Pondering the dilemma
At the Redwood conference
She cries, "my reality is now called
Make Believe, imagination's funeral
Killed by the teenage me"
You don't have to throw it away
Throw being a kid away
Just because you're growing up
Faster every day
You don't have to throw it all away
You don't have to throw it all away
And as you rise
A rose you will forever stay
