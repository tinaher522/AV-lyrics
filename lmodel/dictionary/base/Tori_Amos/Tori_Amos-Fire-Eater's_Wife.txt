<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Fire-Eater's_Wife">
If you see the Fire-Eater's wife
Tell her I heard what she said that night
What would this world be like
What would this world be like
Without nasty girls
Without warm words
Without little wounds
So the Baker's wife told me
"You got a find The Monkey Tree"
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
