Pip I:
Smokey Joe you're calling at the station
If I kill him there are complications
I did not ask for this
"Oh but, love, yes, you did"
Maybe it terrifies me
This quiet siege
Maybe it terrifies me
Pip II:
It's too easy
It's too easy
To wish you harm
It's too easy
You through black ice
At the bottom of the river
Pip I:
Smokey Joe hey what's a revelation?
"That one's past is not a destination
It is a road for fools
Who need empty approvals"
Pip II:
My dark twin
The annihilating Feminine
Does not need
Civilizing
Pip I:
Maybe it terrifies me
This quiet siege
Maybe it terrifies me
Pip II:
It's too easy
It's too easy
To wish you harm
It's too easy
You through black ice
At the bottom of the river
Pip I:
Smokey Joe, hey can you pass the pipe?
"You have been blessed, now go be wise
It is a coward who will say he's not afraid
Of dying when clearly he is potently alive"
Pip II:
A songless robin she became
He stole my sister Clitorides
These silken rubber gloves
Choking his vitriolic tongue
Pip I:
Maybe it terrifies me
This quiet siege
Maybe it terrifies me
This quiet siege
Pip II:
It's too easy
It's too easy
To wish you harm
It's too easy
You through black ice
At the bottom of the river
Pip I / Pip II:
Smokey Joe is calling at the station
Calling at the station
Calling at the station
