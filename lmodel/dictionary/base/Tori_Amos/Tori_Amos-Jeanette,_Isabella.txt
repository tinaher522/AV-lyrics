<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Jeanette,_Isabella">
Bring your torches
Bring your torches
With every candle raised
With every lantern flame
Light after light in every village
Welcoming home every friend
Bring your torches
Bring your torches
Bring your torches, Jeanette, Isabella
Bring your torch to the cradle run
Bring your torches, Jeanette, Isabella
Bring your torch to the cradle run
Christ is born, o come before Him
Mary calls us to adore Him
Hush, hush, such a lovely mother
Hush, hush, such a lovely son
Bring your torches
Bring your torches
Wish every light will find it’s way
This is what every mother prays
Night after night the lights they will guide you
Welcoming home every friend
Bring your torches
Bring your torches
Bring your torches, Jeanette, Isabella
Bring your torch to the cradle run
Through the doorway softly filing
To his manger bed we creep
Torches’ glow the babe discloses
Fair as snow with cheeks like roses
Hush, hush, hushaby sweetly smiling
Hush, hush, hushaby fast asleep, asleep
Bring your torches, Jeanette, Isabella
