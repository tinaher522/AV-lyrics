<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Never_Seen_Blue">
Some boy you are
To take me by the hand
Through an elevator
Got a little red line
That tells you, boy
Where the razor’s been
You said, "Girl if you think
You can turn that violator
You’ll finally be that woman
Finally be that woman
That’s been frozen
In that pretty silver gown" Yes
I’ve never seen blue
Like the blues he drives
In and around
And through me again
I said I’ve never seen eyes
Like the blues he drives
In and around
And through me again
Through me again
Through me again
Some boy you are
To wear my color red
To wear it very proudly
Wear it like a lady
Knows how to cross her legs
Where the birdie’s been
I’ve never seen blue
Like the blues he drives
In and around
And through me again
Said, I said I’ve never seen eyes
Like the blues he drives
In and around
And through me again
Through me again
Through me again
Say la la la
Say goodbye to those you loved
Say
