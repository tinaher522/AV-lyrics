<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Winter's_Carol">
A winter’s carol, first song of the robin
A winter’s carol, echo through the land
And I can hear it
Ringing out, ringing out from pine to oak
Bringing us, with the December snow
Bringing us a gift of old
Wrapped in ribbons of gold
For the whole world
For the whole world
The Summer Queen has been in darkness
The Summer Queen has been in darkness
The Summer Queen surrenders to this
To him she reveals her secrets
To him she reveals her wine and secrets
For a time, for a time they join
Fire and frost in marriage
Through a midwinter clearing
A forest greets a snowy evening
Year after year the Holly King
Passes the torch as it was intended
Through a midwinter clearing
A final kiss and a new beginning
His Summer Queen wearing his wreath
Soon with the sun, she will be ascending
Through a midwinter clearing
The forest greets a snowy evening
With four wands of yew the Holly King
Passes the torch as it was intended
Passes the torch as it was intended
A winter’s carol, first song of the robin
The sun is reborn from the starry heavens
A winter’s carol echoes, sound of wonder
And I can hear it
Ringing out, ringing out from pine to oak
Bringing us, with the December snow
Bringing us a gift of old
Wrapped in ribbons of gold
For the whole world
Wrapped in ribbons of gold
For the whole world
Wrapped in ribbons of gold
For the whole world
For the whole world
For the whole world
Ringing out
Winter’s carol
Ringing out
Ringing out
Winter’s carol
Ringing out
Ringing out
Winter’s
