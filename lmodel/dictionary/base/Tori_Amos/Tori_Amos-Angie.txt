<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Angie">
Angie, Angie
When will those clouds all disappear
Angie, Angie
Where will it lead us from here?
With no loving in our souls
And no money in our coats
You can't say we're satisfied
Angie, Angie
You can't say we never tried
Angie, you're beautiful
Ain't it time we said goodbye
All the dreams we held so close
Seem to all go up in smoke now
Let me whisper in your ear
"Angie, Angie
Where will it lead us from here"
With no loving in our souls
And no money in our coats
You can't say we're satisfied
Oh Angie, I still love you, baby
Everywhere I look I see your eyes
There's not another woman that comes close to you
Dry those tears from your eyes
Hey, Angie, Angie
You can't say we never tried
Angie, I still love you
Ain't it time we said goodbye
