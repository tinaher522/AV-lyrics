<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Bells_For_Her">
And through the life force and there goes her friend;
On her Nishiki, it's out of time...
And through the portal, they can make amends;
Hey... would you say, "Whatever, we're blanket friends"?
Can't stop what's coming, can't stop what is on its way...
And through the walls, they made their mudpies;
"I've got your mind," I said, she said, "I've your voice..."
I said, "You don't need my voice, girl, you have your own,"
But you never thought it was enough of...
So they went, years and years
Like sisters, blanket, blanket girls, 
Always there through, through that and this;
"There's nothing we cannot ever fix," I said...
Can't stop what's coming, can't stop what is on its way...
Hey... can't stop what's coming, can't stop what is on its way...
Bells and footfalls, and soldiers and dolls;
Brothers and lovers, she and I were...
Now she seems to be sand under his shoes;
There's nothing I can do...
Can't stop what's coming, can't stop what is on its way...
Can't stop what's coming, can't stop what is on its way...
And now I speak to you, are you in there?
You have her face and her eyes, but you are not her...
And we go at each other like blankettes,
Blankettes who can't find their... their thread and their bare...
Can't stop... can't stop loving... you...
Can't stop loving, can't stop what is on its way...
And I see it coming, and it's on its way...
