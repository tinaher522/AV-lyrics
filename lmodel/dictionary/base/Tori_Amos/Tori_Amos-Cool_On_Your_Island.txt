<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Cool_On_Your_Island">
If you don't treat me...
If you don't... yeah..
If you don't treat me better, baby, I'll just run away... oh, yeah...
Baby, I don't know what drives you to play these silly games... oh, yeah...
Hey, come on, baby, I'm much stronger than you know;
Sometimes, I'm not afraid to let it show...
When will you wake up?
I want you more than the stars and the sun,
But I can take only so much;
Cool on your island - Is it cool on your island? 
I got a brand new dress, babe - Could it make you wanna try? Oh, yeah...
I guess I didn't want to notice the stars gone from your eyes, yeah...
Hey, come on, baby, I'm must stronger than you know;
Sometimes, I'm not afraid to let it show...
When will you wake up?
I want you more than the stars and the sun,
But I can take only so much;
Cool on your island - Is it cool on your island? 
Hey!
We could buy an airplane (Yeah, yeah...), build a home in the sand (Yeah, yeah...);
You could tell your secrets (Yeah, yeah, oh...) - I could understand (Yeah, yeah...)
But then by the morning (Yeah, yeah...), comes crumbling down (Yeah, yeah, oh...)
And as you're leavin' (Yeah, yeah...), "Wait..."
When will you wake up?
I want you more than the stars and the sun, (Stars and the sun...)
But I can take only so much;
Cool on your island - Is it cool, baby?
When will you wake up? (Will you wake up...)
I want you more than the stars and the sun, (Stars and the sun...)
But I can take only so much;
Cool on your island - You're so cool on your island...
Is it cool on your island?
Is it cool, baby? Yeah...
If you don't treat me better, baby, I'll just run away;
Cool on your island, yeah...
If you don't treat me... Then one day, you'll wake up cold, yeah...
Then you'll know.... you'll know... you'll know...
You love me...
