<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Martha's_Foolish_Ginger">
Take a walk down memory lane with me
Past a watermelon stand on the way
Thinking I had everything we'd need
On Martha's Foolish Ginger
You were late, how could I forget
What you said, the part about that
Love taking over your life
Was not in your plan
If those harbour lights had just been a half a mile inland
Who knows what I would have done
If those harbour lights had just been a half a mile inland
Who knows what I would have done
Through the cliffs out of the bay I went
From the starboard side I could block my
Visions and my passions
They keep me awake
If those harbour lights had just been a half a mile inland
Who knows what I would have done
If those harbour lights had just been a half a mile inland
Who knows what I would have done
A familiar voice, "Hi, surprise
I've been searching trying to find you."
I couldn't speak my hands reached
For Martha's Foolish Ginger
We talked until the moon came up
About how life without love
Isn't worth very much
Then I played this song
If those harbour lights had just been a half a mile inland
Who knows what I would have done
If those harbour lights had just been a half a mile inland
Who knows what I would have done
What I would have done
What I would have done
"Memories that we have yet," you said
"To make like our Burning Bed"
Love, don't mistake that it wasn't safe
On Martha's Foolish Ginger
