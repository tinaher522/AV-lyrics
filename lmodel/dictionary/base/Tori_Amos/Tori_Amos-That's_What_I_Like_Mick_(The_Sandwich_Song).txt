<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="That's_What_I_Like_Mick_(The_Sandwich_Song)">
Cheese and onion sandwiches
On Derby chinaware
Fiddles and jigs and Woogie my dog
And TV, having a swear
Taking my dad for a pint or two
A Sunday morning stroll
Licorice pipes and baggy suits
Glen Hoddle scoring a goal
Catching a pike and riding my bike
On wooden wheels and a bowl of eels
Yes, that's what I like, boy
That's what I like
Pie and mash and liquor
Walking about in the rain
William Brookes and comical looks
Pianos, trams and trains
Colds and cockles and thunderstorms
Place on the wireless and now
Grandfather clocks and coke and brandy
Fountain pens and Beano and Dandy
That's what I like, I said
Hey, that's what I like
Little pubs out in the country
Mother Pearl and Bernard Faire
The sound of a banjo, barbershop singing
And having a kip in the chair
Burnt toast, a beer from the wood
And old Jerry Thomas' teeth
Jerry and Chuck and Cannon and Ball
A banjo picking Bill Keith
And old bank loads, wood burning stoves
And Shirley MacLaine and petticoat lane
That's what I like, I said
That's what I like, yes, boy
Yes, that's just
Bubble and squeak and jumble sales
Little Richard and Jerry Lee
Bonfire night and south
And that's paddling in the sea
Polished brass and copper
Salvation Army bands
Violins and old coach inns
And coloured elastic bands
Tea in the morning and winter beginning
And fishing lines and frogs and Spurs are winning
Yes that's what I like
Hey, that's what I like
A day at the races, cover the bases
Going out hopping in Kent
A new pair of braces, little kids' faces
Sleeping under the tent
And wagons, chickens and picking blackberries
And swallows and sledges and Devon and derries
And haddock and trotters and horses and knickers
And swatters and stickers and banjo and kippers
Yeah, that's what I like, boy
That's what I like
