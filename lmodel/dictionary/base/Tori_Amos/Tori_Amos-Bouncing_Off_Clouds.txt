<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Bouncing_Off_Clouds">
Bouncing off of clouds we were
Is there a love lost and found?
Make it easy, make this easy
It's not as heavy as it seems
Wrapped in metal, wrapped in ivy
Paint it in mint ice cream
We could be bouncing off the top of this cloud 
I'll put on my silver
Bouncing off the top of this cloud
Failure to respond but
I did, but did you listen?
Bouncing off the top of this cloud
I'll put on my silver
About what you said, has it come to this?
I'll put on my silver
Bouncing off the top of this cloud
Well, you can stare all day at the sky
But that won't bring her back
That won't bring her back
You said you're waiting on fate
But I think fate is now
I think fate is now waiting on us
Make this easy, easy, easy
We could make this easy, easy, love, easy
We could make this easy, make this easy
It's not as heavy as it seems
Make this easy, make this easy
It's not as heavy as it seems
Wrapped in metal, wrapped in ivy
Blue umbrellas now smiling
We could be bouncing off the top of this cloud
I'll put on my silver
About what you said, has it come to this?
I'll put on my silver
Bouncing off the top of this cloud
I'll put on my silver
About what you said, has it come to this?
I'll put on my silver
Bouncing off of clouds we were
