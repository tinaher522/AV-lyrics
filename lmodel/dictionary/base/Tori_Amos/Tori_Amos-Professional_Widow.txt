<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Professional_Widow">
Slag pit
Stag shit
Honey bring it close to my lips
Yes
Don't blow those brains yet
We got to be big boy
We got to be big
Starfucker, just like my Daddy, yes
Starfucker, just like my Daddy, yes
Selling his baby, yes
Just like my daddy, yes
Going to strike a deal
Made him feel like a congressman
Running in the family, oh
It's run in the family
Rest your shoulders, peaches and cream
Everywhere a Judas as far as you can see
Beautiful angel calling,
"We've got every re-run of Muhammad Ali"
Prism perfect
Honey bring it close to your lips
Yes
What is termed a landslide
Of principle proportion boy
It's got to be big
I said it better be big
Starfucker, just like my daddy, yes
Starfucker, just like my daddy, yes
Selling his baby, yes
Just like your daddy, yes
Selling his baby
Going to strike a deal
Make him feel like a congressman
It's runnning in the family, oh
It's run in the family, hey
It's running in the family, hey baby
It's run in the family, hey yeah
Mother Mary, China white
Brown may be sweeter, may be sweeter
Mother Mary, China white
Brown may be sweeter, she will supply
She will supply
She will supply
She will supply
She will supply
Supply, supply
Give me peace, love, peace, love
Give me peace, love and a hard cock
