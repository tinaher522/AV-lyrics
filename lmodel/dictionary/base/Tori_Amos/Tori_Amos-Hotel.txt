<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Hotel">
Met them in a hotel
Met them in a hotel
Beneath ground
Tell me that he's missing
Tell me this is one for
Lollipop Gestapo
You were wild, where are you now?
You were wild, where are you now?
Give me more, give me more, give me more
Give me more, give me more, give me more
I have to learn to let you crash down
I have to learn to let you crash
Met them in a hotel
Met them in a hotel
You say he's the biggest thing there'll be this year
I guess that what I'm seeking
I guess that what I'm seeking isn't here
Met him in a hotel
Met him in a guess world
Guessed anyone but you
You were wild, where are you now?
You were wild, where are you now?
Give me more, give me more, give me more
Give me more, give me more, give me, can't you just
Give me more, give me more, give me more
I have to learn to let you crash down
I have to learn to let you crash down
I have to learn to let you crash
Where are the velvets? Where?
Where are the velvets, when you're coming, coming down?
Where are the velvets? Where?
Where are the velvets, when you're coming, coming down?
Hotel
You were wild, where are you now?
You were wild, where are you now?
You were wild
King Solomon's Mines
Exit 75
I'm still alive, I'm still alive, I'm still alive
I'm still alive, I'm still alive, I'm still alive
