<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Maids_Of_Elfen-Mere">
The Maids of Elfen-mere
Watch over the boy with chestnut hair
And as he dreams about his love for them
They make a vow to protect him
Spinning their song
Sung by a happy corpse
Foreseeing a pretty girl drawing
Her arrow
But what they want to know
Will she bring him
True love
Or sorrow
The Maids of Elfen-mere
Don't know that the boy with chestnut hair
Winds back the clock at the 11th bell
Hoping to follow them
Through the veil
Spinning their song
Sung by a happy corpse
Foreseeing a pretty girl drawing
Her arrow
But what they want to know
Will the Queen of Eastland or the Wastelands be waking
The Maids of Elfen-mereâ€¨
