<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Not_Dying_Today">
There was a gambler and a cleaner and a puppeteer
Only the puppet could explain just what he was
All on a bus we were hopin' to pass the time
Plug my piece in boys then we can drink the wine
Drink the wine, drink the wine
Well, music, good friends
I'm not dyin' today
I may be 6 feet under, full of wonder
I'm not dyin' today
Dying today, today, today
I'm not dying, mister, today, today
Neil is thrilled he can claim he's mammalian
"But the bad news," he said, "Girl, you're a dandelion"
Dandelion. Hey, I need to think about that
Yeah, I thought about that and I said,
"What the hell?"
He said, "Nope, you are Earth bound, blow them seeds away
Maybe one will make a sound."
Make a sound
Well, music, good friends
I'm not dyin' today
I may be 6 feet under, full of thunder,
I'm not dyin' today
Dying today, today, today
I'm not dying, mister, today, today
So they got us go
Goin' and comin'
'Cause they make us pay
If we go or stay
Is he prayin'
That I'll pop my clogs?
If they can't prove I'm crazy
By noon I'll be pushin' up them daisies
Tomorrow, with their Donut box, they'll say,
"It's sad she's brown bread"
I got my weapons
Music, good friends
I'm not dyin' today
I may be 6 feet under
Way down yonder
I'm not dyin' today
Dyin' today, today
I'm not dying, sister
Take your paws off 
My ankle straps and my mister
Dyin', fryin', rather have a lie-in
I am not blowing that Gabriel's Trumpet
I got my own band to play today
