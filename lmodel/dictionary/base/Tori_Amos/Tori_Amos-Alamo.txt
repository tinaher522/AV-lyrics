<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Alamo">
Alamo
Heard all about your fandango
Banged on my knees on your back door
Only to wake you to
Blues on the way
Blues on the way
Blues on the way
Embarcadero
Figures you’ll see me as a older
Twenty three hours till the border
Don’t think I’ll be going as
Fast as I came
Fast as I came
Fast as I came
Tears on my pillow
Of course they’re not mine
Alter that altar
Making a play
Somebody invent the telephone line
I’ll take my chances
Alamo
Wish I could do what gold does
Heard that the stars were in order
Got yourself dealt a hand with
Two queen of spades
And blues on the way
Blues on the way
Tears on my pillow
Of course they’re not mine
Alter that altar
Making a play
Somebody just
Somebody invent the telephone line
I’ll take my chances
