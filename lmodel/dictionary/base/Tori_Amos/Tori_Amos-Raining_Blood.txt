<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Raining_Blood">
Trapped in purgatory
A lifeless object, alive
Awaiting reprisal
"Death," I said.
She said, "Death will be their acquisition."
The sky is turning red
Return to power draws near
Fall into me, into
Fall into me the sky's crimson tears
Abolish the rules
Abolish the rules made of stone
Pierced from below
Souls of my treacherous past
Betrayed by many
Now ornaments dripping above
Awaiting the hour of reprisal
Your time slips away
Raining blood
Raining blood
From a lacerated sky
Bleeding its horror
Creating my structure
Now I shall reign in blood
