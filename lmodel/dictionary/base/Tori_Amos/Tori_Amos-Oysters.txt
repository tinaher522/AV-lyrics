<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Oysters">
So can these shoes take me to
Who I was before
I was stabbing my sticks into
A vulnerable earth
And I can almost out run you
And those stalking memories
Did I somehow become you
Without realizing
Found a little patch of heaven now
So then I'm gonna turn oysters in the sand
Cause I'm working my way back
I'm working my way back to me again
Not every girl is a pearl
With these ruby slippers
With these ruby slippers
So then I'm gonna turn oysters in the sand
In the sand
Turn
Turn
Turn
And there are forces of conflict
Taking portions of my mind
In whose realm laced with trickery
The fragments I must find
And I can almost out run you
And those stalking memories
Did I somehow become you
Without realizing
Found a little patch of heaven now
So then I'm gonna turn oysters in the sand
Cause I'm working my way back
I'm working my way back to me again
Not every girl is a pearl
With these ruby slippers
With these ruby slippers
So then I'm gonna turn oysters in the sand
Turn
Turn
Not every girl is popular
Popular
Popular
Not every girl is a pearl
With these ruby slippers
With these ruby slippers
So then I'm gonna turn oysters in the sand
In the sand
In the sand
Turn
Turn
Turn
