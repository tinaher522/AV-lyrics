<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Glory_Of_The_80's">
I took a taxi from L.A. to Venus in 1985
I was electromagnetically sucked back into a party going on that night
It was the glories of the 80's with karma drawn up in lines
And two Bugle Boy models saying, "Baby, it's free-bee, you sure look deprived"
I had the Story Of O in my bucket seat of my wannabe Mustang
Auditioning for reptiles in their Raquel Welch campaign
In the glories of the 80's, you said, "I'm not afraid to die"
I said, I don't find that remotely funny, even on this space cake high
And then when it all seemed clear
Just then you go and disappear, disappear, disappear
Silicone party Barbies to the left and Joan Of Arcs to the right
No one feeling insecure, we were all gorge and famous in our last lives
In the glories of the 80's, you said, "The end is nothing to fear"
I said, "Blow the end now, baby, who do I got to shag to get out of here?"
And then when it all seemed clear
Just then you go and disappear, disappear, disappear, disappear
Sure you're out there orbiting around
Sure you're out there orbiting around
Wish I had you back
Sure you're out there orbiting around
Sure you're out there orbiting around
Wish I had you back now
I met a drag king called Venus, she had a velvet hologram
She said, "My husband ran off with my shaman but they love me as I am"
In the glories of the 80's, I may not have to die
I'll clone myself like that blonde chick that sings "Bette Davis Eyes"
And then when it all seemed clear
Just then you go and
Sure you're out there orbiting around
Sure you're out there orbiting around
Wish I had you back now
Wish I had you back now
And then when it all seemed clear
Just then you go and disappear, disappear, disappear, disappear
I took a taxi from L.A. to Venus in 198-
198-, 198-, 1985
