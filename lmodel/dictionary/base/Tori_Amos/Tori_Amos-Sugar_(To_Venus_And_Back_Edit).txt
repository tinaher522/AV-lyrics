<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Sugar_(To_Venus_And_Back_Edit)">
Don't say morning's come
Don't say it's up to me
If I could take 25 minutes
Out of the record books
Sugar, bring me sugar
Bobby's collecting bees
and hammers, he used one on me
Cold war with little boys
Get in with a bubble gum trade and
Sugar, bring me sugar, well
I know the robins bring
Bring me many things but
Sugar, just bring me sugar, yeah
As far as I can see him
I've been gone for miles now
And you know, and I know
I don't know me very well
And I know, and you know
If they found me out
Just wait, you just, you just watch what they do
Sweet boy when they find you out
Tell me what you think they'll do
Pretty thing, you gonna leave?
Tell me what you think they'll do
When they find you out
When they find you out
Find out, you're just a pussy
My sweet boy
My sugar, hey, sugar
And all the robins bring
Bring me many things but sugar
Bring sugar, yes
And all the robins bring
Bring many things
My sugar
Bring me sugar
Oh they did it to you
Oh my God, my sweet boy
