<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Why_Don't_You_Love_Me?">
Why don't you love me?
Why don't you love me?
Why don't you love me?
I gave you my life
I gave you my time
What more could I do?
I'm broken inside
I rose each morning
Worked way past midnight
Exhausted, expired
Now you kick me out?
Why don't you love me?
What's a woman to do?
Why don't you love me? (Do I)
Mean so little to you?
It's been so long our lives
What's wrong? What's right?
I did everything
Everything was for you
Why don't you love me?
My legs won't hold me
My chest feels so strange
Why don't you love me?
Was it something that I said?
How can you say this?
And when did you change?
You used to love me
Was it just pretend?
Why don't you love me?
Just look at Nixon
They tore him apart
How could you be so hard?
I gave you my heart
Does it add up to nothing
The years that we've been through?
And how can you say this to me
When I did everything?
Everything was for you
Why don't you love me?
Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?
