<song artist="Tori_Amos" title="Yo_George">
I salute to you, Commander, and I sneeze
'Cause I have now an allergy to your policies, it seems
Where have we gone wrong, America?
Mr. Lincoln, we can't seem to find you anywhere
Out of the millions
From the deserts to the mountains
Over prairies to the shores
Is this just the Madness of King George?
Yo, George
Is this just the Madness of King George?
Yo, George
Well, you have the whole nation on all fours
