<song artist="Oasis" title="Falling_Down">
The summer sun that blows my mind
Is falling down on all that I've ever known
In time we'll kiss the world goodbye
Falling down on all that I've ever known
Is all that I've ever known
A dying scream makes no sound
Calling out to all that I've ever known
Here am I, lost and found
Calling out to all
We live a dying dream
If you know what I mean
And all that I've ever known
It's all that I've ever known
Catch the wheel that breaks a butterfly
I cry the rain that fills the ocean wide
I tried to talk with God to no avail
I called Him up in-and-out of nowhere
I said, "If you won't save me, please don't waste my time"
All that I've ever known
It's all that I've ever known
Catch the wheel that breaks the butterfly
I cry the rain that fills the ocean wide
I tried to talk with God to no avail
I called Him up in-and-out of nowhere
"And if you won't save me, please don't waste my time"
The summer sun that blows my mind
Is falling down on all that I've ever known
In time we'll kiss the world goodbye
Falling down on all that I've ever known
Is all that I've ever known
