<song artist="Oasis" title="The_Nature_Of_Reality">
The nature of reality
Is pure subjective fantasy
Space and time and here and now
Are only in your mind
I seen off God and devil too
With no weapon, just the truth
Belief does not existence make
It's only in your mind
The nature of reality
Is only in your mind
