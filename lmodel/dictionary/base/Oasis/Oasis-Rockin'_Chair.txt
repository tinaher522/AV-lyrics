<song artist="Oasis" title="Rockin'_Chair">
I'm older than I'd wish to be
This town holds no more for me
All my life
I've tried to find another way
I don't care for your attitude
You bring me down, I think you're rude
All my life
I've tried to make a better day
It's hard enough being alone
Sittin' here by the phone
Waitin' for my memories
To come and play
It's hard enough sittin' there
Rockin' in your rockin' chair
It's all too much for me to take
When you're not there
It's hard enough being alone
Sittin' here by the phone
Waitin' for my memories
To come and play
It's hard enough sittin' there
Rockin' in your rockin' chair
It's all too much for me to take
When you're not there
I'm older than I'd wish to be
This town holds no more for me
All my life
I've tried to find another way
I don't care for your attitude
You bring me down I think you're rude
All my life
I've tried to make a better day
It's hard enough being alone
Sittin' here by the phone
Waitin' for my memories
To come and play
It's hard enough sittin' there
Rockin' in your rockin' chair
It's all too much for me to take
When you're not there
