<song artist="Oasis" title="Talk_Tonight">
Sittin' on my own, chewin' on a bone
A thousand million miles from home when
Something hit me
Somewhere right between the eyes
Sleepin' on a plane, you know you can't complain
You took your last chance once again, I
Landed stranded
Hardly even knew your name
I wanna talk tonight
Until the mornin' light
'Bout how you saved my life
And you and me see how we are
You and me see how we are
All your dreams are made of strawberry lemonade
And you make sure I eat today, you
Take me walking
To where you played when you were young
I'll never say that I won't ever make you cry
And this I say, I don't know why I
Know I'm leaving
But I'll be back another day
I wanna talk tonight
Until the mornin' light
'Bout how you saved my life
I wanna talk tonight
'Bout how you saved my life
'Bout how you saved my life
'Bout how you saved my life
'Bout how you saved my life
