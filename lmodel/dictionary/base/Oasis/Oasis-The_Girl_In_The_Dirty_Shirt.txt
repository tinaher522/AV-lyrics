<song artist="Oasis" title="The_Girl_In_The_Dirty_Shirt">
If I may be so bold that I just say something
Come and make me my day
The clouds around your soul don't gather there for nothing
I can chase them all away
Why'd you need a reason for to feel happy
Or shining for the rest of the world
Give me just a smile and would you make it snappy
Get your shit together, girl
You've got a feeling lost inside, it
Just won't let you go
Your life is sneaking up behind, it
Just won't let you go
No, it just won't let you go
Is what I'm trying to say
Is would you maybe
Come dancing me
'Cause to me it doesn't matter
If your hopes and dreams are shattered
When you say something
You make me believe
In the girl who wears a dirty shirt
She knows exactly what she's worth
She knows exactly what she's worth to me
But I can see
I can see
If you ever find yourself inside a bubble
You gotta make your own way home
You can call me anytime you're seeing double
Now you know you're not alone
You've got a feeling lost inside, it
Just won't let you go
Your life is sneaking up behind, it
Just won't let you go
No, it just won't let you go
Is what I'm trying to say
Is would you maybe
Come dancing with me
'Cause to me it doesn't matter
If your hopes and dreams are shattered
When you say something
You make me believe
In the girl who wears a dirty shirt
She knows exactly what she's worth
Maybe
She'll come dancing with me
'Cause to me it doesn't matter
If her hopes and dreams are shattered
When she says something
She'll make me believe
In the girl who wears a dirty shirt
She knows exactly what she's worth to me
She knows exactly what she's worth to me
She knows exactly what she's worth to me
She knows exactly what she's worth to me
She knows exactly what she's worth to me
And now I see
And now I see
And now I see
Now I see
Now I see
Now I see
Now I see
Now I see
Now I see
Now I see
Now I see
Now I see
