<song artist="Oasis" title="Going_Nowhere">
Hate the way that you've taken back
Everything you've given to me
And the way that you'd always say
It's nothin' to do with me
Different versions of many men
Come before you came
All their questions were similar
The answers just the same
I gonna get me a motor car, maybe a Jaguar
Maybe a plane or a day of fame
I'm gonna be a millionaire, so can you take me there
I wanna be wild 'cause my life's so tame
Here am I
Going nowhere on a train
Here am I
Growing older than the rain
Hate the way that you've taken back
Everything you've given to me
And the way that you'd always say
It's nothin' to do with me
Different versions of many men
Come before you came
All their questions were similar
The answers just the same
I'm gonna get me a motor car, maybe a Jaguar
Maybe a plane or a day of fame
I'm gonna be a millionaire, so can you take me there
I wanna be wild 'cause my life's so tame
Here am I
Going nowhere on a train
Here am I
Growing older than the rain
Here am I
Going nowhere on a train
Here am I
Getting lost and lonely, sad and only
Wild sometimes 'cause my life feels so tame
