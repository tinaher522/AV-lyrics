<song artist="Oasis" title="Waiting_For_The_Rapture">
I still don't know what I was waiting for
A big love to fall down from the sky?
She took my hand and picked me up off the floor
She put an apple in my eye
I said I'm tired
Come get me off the merry-go-round
I'm wired
Come feed me and then bring me down
She come up to me
I can't remember what she said
Cos I was in a trance and I forgot it all
Bangin' on about all that
Revolution in her head
She's making love seem so magical
She said I'm tired
Come get me off the merry-go-round
I'm wired
Well, heaven must have sent you
To save me for the rapture, yeah
I'm tired
Come get me off the merry-go-round
I'm wired
Come feed me and then bring me down
Lay my soul on the ground
Like a million more that have me down
