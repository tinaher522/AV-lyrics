<song artist="Oasis" title="Be_Here_Now">
Wash your face in the morning sun
Flash your pen at the song that I'm singing
Touch down bass living on the run
I make no sweat at the hole that you're digging
Wrap up cold when it's warm outside
Your shit jokes remind me of Digsy's
Be my magic carpet ride
Fly me down to capital city in the sun
Kicking up a storm
From the day that I was born
Sing a song to me, one from Let It Be
Open up your eyes, get a grip on yourself inside
So wash your face in the morning sun
Flash your pen at the song that I'm singing
Touch down bass living on the run
Make no sweat of the hole that you're digging
Kicking up a storm
From the day that I was born
Sing a song for me, one from Let It Be
Open up your eyes, get a grip on yourself inside
Inside
Get a grip inside
Get a grip inside
You betcha
You betcha
So wrap up cold when it's warm outside
Please sit down, you make me feel giddy
Be my magic carpet ride
Fly me down to Capital City
Been kicking up a storm
From the day that I was born
Sing a song for me, one from Let It Be
Open up your eyes, get a grip on yourself inside
Get a grip inside
Get a grip inside
Get a grip inside
Get a grip inside
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
Yeah, yeah, yeah
