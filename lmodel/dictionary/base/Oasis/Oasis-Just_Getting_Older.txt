<song artist="Oasis" title="Just_Getting_Older">
It's nine o'clock
I'm getting tired
I'm sick of all my records and the clothes I bought today
Am I cracking up
Or just getting older?
Staying in
I can't be bothered
Making conversation with the friends that I don't know
Am I cracking up
Or just getting older?
And I bet that this is how life 
Turns out when you're finally grown
And you know if this my life
Sit around all day and I moan
I'm halfway up to the bottom
Of another bottle
Of my next best favourite friend
Am I cracking up
Or just getting older?
You're not cracking up
You're just getting older
We're not cracking up
We're just getting older
