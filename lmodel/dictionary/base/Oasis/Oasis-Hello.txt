<song artist="Oasis" title="Hello">
I don't feel as if I know you
You take up all my time
The days are long and the nights will throw you away
'Cause the sun don't shine
Nobody ever mentions the weather
Can make or break your day
Nobody ever seems to remember
Life is a game we play
We live in the shadows and we
Had the chance and threw it away
And it's never gonna be the same
'Cause the years are falling by like the rain
It's never gonna be the same
'Til the life I knew comes to my house and says "hello"
There ain't no sense in feeling lonely
They got no faith in you
But I've got a feeling you still owe me
So wipe the shit from your shoes
Nobody ever mentions the weather
Can make or break your day
Nobody ever seems to remember
Life is a game we play
We live in the shadows and we
Had the chance and threw it away
And it's never gonna be the same
'Cause the years are falling by like the rain
And it's never gonna be the same
'Til the life I knew comes to my house and says
Hello, hello (it's good to be back, good to be back)
Hello, hello (it's good to be back, good to be back)
Hello, hello (it's good to be back, good to be back)
Hello, hello, hello
