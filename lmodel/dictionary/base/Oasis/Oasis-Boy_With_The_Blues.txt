<song artist="Oasis" title="Boy_With_The_Blues">
You sing, you shout
You turn the world around
Yea we come all together for you
You let me see
The man I'm gonna be
Yea we come all together for you

Remember to shine
Let my love take you high
You've nothing to lose
You're just the boy with the blues

You take a vow
Never to back down
Yea we come all together for you
And my dreams are bound
To come true somehow
Yea we come all together for you

Remember to shine
Let my love take you high
You've nothing to lose
You're just the boy with the blues
Remember to smile
Let my love take you high
I'm nothing to lose
I'm just the boy with the blues
Yeah

Come all together, come all together (x 7)
Come all together for you
