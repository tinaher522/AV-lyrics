<song artist="Oasis" title="Pass_Me_Down_The_Wine">
Will you pass me down the wine?
its getting near that time
What you got tomorrow?
Only pain and sorrow
Will you dance for me tonight
I promise I wont bite
Lets go and see the sun burst
Wait till i go NUMB first
And in the morning come to us
And if the evening showers us
Sing to Us
Will you break it down for me
Coz what will be will be
I can hear the thunder
Gonna stop the hunger
And in the morning come to us
And if the evening showers us
Sing to Us
To all my sisters
Yeh you're looking really fine
Yo all my brothers
Bet you're feeling kinda high
To all the mothers
Well come on now don't be shy
To all the fathers
Who are sick and f**king tired
(Liam Screeching break)
