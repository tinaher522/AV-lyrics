<song artist="Oasis" title="Don't_Go_Away">
Cold and frosty morning, there's not a lot to say
About the things caught in my mind
And as the day is dawning my plane flew away
With all the things caught in my mind
I don't wanna be there when you're coming down
I don't wanna be there when you hit the ground
So don't go away
Say what you say
Say that you'll stay
Forever and a day
In the time of my life
'Cause I need more time
Yes, I need more time
Just to make things right
Damn my situation and the games I have to play
With all the things caught in my mind
Damn my education, I can't find the words to say
With all the things caught in my mind
And I wanna be there when you're coming down
And I wanna be there when you hit the ground
So don't go away
Say what you say
Say that you'll stay
Forever and a day
In the time of my life
'Cause I need more time
Yes, I need more time
Just to make things right
Me and you, what's going on
All we seem to know is how to show
The feelings that are wrong
So don't go away
Say what you say
Say that you'll stay
Forever and a day
In the time of my life
'Cause I need more time
Yes, I need more time
Just to make things right
And don't go away
Say what you say
Say that you'll stay
Forever and a day
In the time of my life
'Cause I need more time
Yes, I need more time
Just to make things right
Yes, I need more time
Just to make things right
Yes, I need more time
Just to make things right
So don't go away
