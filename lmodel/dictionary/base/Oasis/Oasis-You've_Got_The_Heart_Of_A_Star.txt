<song artist="Oasis" title="You've_Got_The_Heart_Of_A_Star">
You're never gonna get along, hanging out, thinkin' out loud
You're never gonna get it on and be someone stuck in that crowd
So, you call out for feelings you hope that don't never exist
But don't be ashamed of your bones and your blisters
So come on, come on my brothers and sisters
'Coz you can only be what you are and you've got
The heart of a star but the light never hits ya
And I said come on, come on my brothers and sisters
If you could see what I could see, maybe we could all get along
And maybe I can justify the bad things in life that I've done
So, I call out the feelin' I know that don't never exist
I won't be ashamed of my bones and my blisters
So come on, come on my brothers and sisters
'Coz you can only be what you are 'coz you've got
The heart of a star but the light never hits ya
And I said come on, come on my brothers and sisters
And the slower that you go, the greener the grass grows
And what we all need is love in our lives
So go about you business 'cos life ain't your mistress
Come on, come on my brothers and sisters
'Coz you can only be what you are 'coz you've got
The heart of a star but the light never hits ya
So be all you can and just hold up your hands
Someday you'll understand why life never kissed you
And I said come on, come on my brothers and sisters
Come on, come on my brothers and sisters
I said come on, come on my brothers and sisters
I said come on, come on my brothers and sisters
I said come on, come on my brothers and sisters
