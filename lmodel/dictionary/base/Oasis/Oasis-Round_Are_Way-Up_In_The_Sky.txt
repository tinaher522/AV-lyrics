"Round our way"
The paper boy is working before he goes
Lying to the teacher he knows he knows
He didn't and he should've
Brought his lines in yesterday
Ernie bangs the sound and the day begins
The letterbox is open and your cash falls in
I'll meet you at the office
Just before the staff clock in
Round are way the birds are singing
Round are way the sun shines bright
Round are way the birds sing for yer
The already know yer
The game is kicking off in around the park
It's twenty five a side and before it's dark
There's gonna be a loser
And you know the next goal wins
Cab it to the front as it's called a draw
Everybody's knockin at yours once more
Ernie bangs the sound
And no one's spoken since half past four
Round are way the birds are singing
Round are way the sun shines bright
Round are way the birds are minging
Round are way it's alright
Round are way the birds sing for you
'Cause the already know yer
They already know yer
"Up in the sky"
Hey you! Up in the sky
Learning to fly
Tell me how high
Do you think you'll go
Before you start falling
Hey you! Up in a tree
You wanna be me
But that couldn't be
'Cause the people here they
Don't hear you calling
How does it feel
When you're inside me?
Hey you! wearing the crown
Making no sound
I heard you feel down
Well that's too bad
Welcome to my world
Hey you! Stealing the light
I heard that the shine's
Gone out of your life.
Well that's just too bad
Welcome to my world
You'll need assistance
With the things that you
Have never ever seen
It's just a case of
Never breathing out
Before you've breathed it in
How does it feel
When you're inside me?
Hey you! Up in the sky
Learning to fly
Tell me how high Do you
Think you'll go
Before you start falling
Hey you! Up in a tree
You wanna be me
But that couldn't be
'Cause the people here they
Don't hear you calling
How does it feel
When you're inside me?
You'll need assistance
With the things that you
Have never ever seen
It's just a case of
Never breathing out
Before you've breathed it in
How does it feel
When you're inside me?
