<song artist="Oasis" title="Turn_Up_The_Sun">
I carry madness
Everywhere I go
Over the border
And back to the snow
So if you see me
And I look right through
You shouldn't take it
As a reflection on you
Come on, turn up the sun
Turn it up for everyone
Love one another
Love one another
The boys in the bubble
They wanna be free
And they got so blind
That they cannot see
But I'm not your keeper
I don't have a key
I got a piano
I can't find the 'C'
Come on, turn up the sun
Turn it up for everyone
Love one another
Love one another
Come on, turn up the sun
Turn it up for everyone, yeah
Love one another
Love one another
