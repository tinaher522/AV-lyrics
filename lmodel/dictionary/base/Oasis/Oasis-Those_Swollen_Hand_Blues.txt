<song artist="Oasis" title="Those_Swollen_Hand_Blues">
I can't see the wood for the trees
Life is like a roller coaster
I can't find the birds or the bees
Hope theyâ€™re down the back of my sofa
Feeling like a rolling stone
Playing the guitar on my own
I'm the apple of my eye
If only I could keep myself sober i'd remind myself why
They stare at me wherever I go
Why won't everybody give up, no
I wish I learn to play piano
If only I could keep myself sober for more than one day
