What a life it would be
If you could come to mine for tea
I'll pick you up at half-past three
We'll have lasagna
I'll treat you like a queen
I'll give you strawberries and cream
Then your friends will all go green
For my lasagna
These could be the best days of our lives
But I don't think we've been living very wise
Oh, no, no
What a life it would be
If you could come to mine for tea
I'll pick you up at half-past three
We'll have lasagna
These could be the best days of our lives
But I don't think we've been living very wise
I said, oh, no, no
What a life it would be
If you could come to mine for tea
I'll pick you up at half-past three
We'll have lasagna
I'll treat you like a queen
I'll give you strawberries and cream
Then your friends will all go green
Then your friends will all go green
Then your friends will all go green
For my lasagna
