<song artist="Oasis" title="Untitled_2">
I don't know what it is that makes me feel alive
I don't know how to wake the things that sleep inside
I only wanna see the light that shines behind your eyes
I hope that i can say the things i wish i'd said
To sing my soul to sleep and take me back to bed 
You want to be alone when we can be alive instead
Because we need each other
We believe in one another
And i know we're gonna uncover what's sleepin' in our soul
Because we need each other
We believe in one another
And i know we're gonna uncover what's sleepin' in our soul
What's sleepin' in our soul
There are many things that i would like to know 
And there are many places that i wish to go
But everything's depending on the way the wind may blow
Repeat verse 1
Repeat chorus
Cause' we belive x4, Because we need x2
