<song artist="Oasis" title="Flashbax">
I spend my time sittin' on the fence with a mate of mine
I'm tryin to write the line of the story
We believe that everything said is a waste of time
'Cos life is well tried and it bores me
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
In my well paid opinion
These things they really don't matter
But from my crystal gazing eye
There shines a light, like dynamite
Sittin' on a throne will give a bad back to you
Livin' on my own was like a Flashback
To the days when I was lost and lonely
Saying what I said was just a different story
All your lies well they still bore me
There's nothin' wrong with my world
These things they really don't matter now
I spend my time sittin' on the fence with a mate of mine
I'm tryin to write the line of the story
We believe that everything said is a waste of time
'Cos life is well tried and it bores me
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
In my well paid opinion
These things they really don't matter
'Cos from my crystal gazin' eye
There shines a light, like dynamite
Sittin' on a throne will give a bad back to you
Livin' on my own was like a Flashback
To the days when I was lost and lonely
Saying what I said was just a different story
All those lies man, they bore me
There's nothin wrong in my world
These things they really don't matter
These things they really don't matter now
Sittin' on a throne will give a bad back to you
Livin' on my own was like a Flashback
To the days when I was lost and lonely
Saying what I said was just a different story
All your lies man, they still bore me There's nothin wrong in my world
And these things they really don't matter
These things they really don't matter now
Don't matter now
Don't matter now
Don't matter now
Don't matter now
Don't matter now
Don't matter now
Don't matter now
Don't matter now
