<song artist="Oasis" title="Guess_God_Thinks_I'm_Abel">
I could be your lover
You could be all mine
We'd go on forever
Till the end of time
You could be my best friend
Stay up all night long
You could be my railroad
We'd go on and on
Let's get along
There's nothing here to do
Let's go find a rainbow
I could be wrong
But what am I to do
Guess God thinks I'm Abel
You could be my enemy
I guess there's still time
I'd get round to loving you
Is that such a crime
Let's get along
There's nothing here to do
Let's go find a rainbow
I could be wrong
But what am I to do
Guess God thinks I'm Abel
No one could break us
No one could take us
If they tried
No one could break us
No one could take us
If they tried
No one could break us
No one could take us
If they tried
Come along
Let's make it tonight
