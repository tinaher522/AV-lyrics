<song artist="Oasis" title="I_Will_Believe">
I'm locked up in chains
For the rest of my life
There's no one else to blame but me
The start of the day's
Just the end of the night
I'm feeling like I'm lost at sea
Sometimes is just seems so simple
I'm feeling like I'm down on my knees
Sometimes like a man in the middle
I don't know my own mind
Won't you let me be
'Cause I can find you
Living in my world
Dragging me round
Just like a dog on a lead
But when I find my
Own peace of mind I
I will believe
I'm locked up in chains
For the rest of my life
There's no one else to blame but me
'Cause I can find you
Living in my world
Dragging me round
Just like a dog on a lead
But when I find
My own peace of mind I
I will believe
I will believe
