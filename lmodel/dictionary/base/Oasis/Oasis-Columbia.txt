<song artist="Oasis" title="Columbia">
There we were, now here we are
All this confusion, nothing's the same to me
There we were, now here we are
All this confusion, nothing's the same to me
I can't tell you the way I feel
Because the way I feel is, oh, so new to me
I can't tell you the way I feel
Because the way I feel is, oh, so new to me
What I heard is not what I hear
I can see the signs but they're not very clear
What I heard is not what I hear
I can see the signs but they're not very clear
So I can't tell you the way I feel
Because the way I feel is, oh, so new to me
I can't tell you the way I feel
Because the way I feel is, oh, so new to me
This is confusion, am I confusing you
This is confusion, am I confusing you
This is peculiar, we don't want to fool ya
This is peculiar, we don't want to fool ya
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
