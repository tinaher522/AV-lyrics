<song artist="Oasis" title="Ain't_Got_Nothin'">
They got nothin' on me anymore
They got nothin' on you
I don't care what they say anymore
All I want is the truth
Out on bail
To unveil
Here's a song
Sing along
They got nothin' for me anymore
I got nothin' for you
I don't care what they say anymore
All I want is the truth
Out on bail
To unveil
Here's a song
Sing along
Watch my style
Pick up pace
Wipe that smile
From your face
Out on bail
To unveil
Here's a song
Sing along
Watch my style
Pick up pace
Wipe that smile
From your face
They got nothin' on me anymore
They got nothin' on you
I don't care what they say anymore
All I want is the truth
