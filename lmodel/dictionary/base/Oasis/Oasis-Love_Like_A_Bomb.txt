<song artist="Oasis" title="Love_Like_A_Bomb">
I'm seein'
A whole 'nother world in my mind
Girl, I'm feelin'
An' breathing in love all the time
You turn me on
Yer love's like a bomb
Yer blowin' my mind
You turn me on
Yer love's like a bomb
Yer blowin' my mind
Am I reachin'
The world that I want deep inside
Girl, I mean it
An' you hold the key to the shrine
Cos you turn me on
Yer love's like a bomb
Yer blowin' my mind
You turn me on
Yer love's like a bomb
Yer blowin' my mind
Blowin' my mind
Blowin' my mind
Blowin' my mind
She's blowin' my mind
Yeah, I'm seeing
A whole 'nother world in my mind
Girl, I'm feelin'
That we've been in love all the time
Cos you turn me on
Yer love's like a bomb
Yer blowin' my mind
You turn me on
Yer love's like a bomb
Yer blowin' my mind
Yeah, I'm seein'
