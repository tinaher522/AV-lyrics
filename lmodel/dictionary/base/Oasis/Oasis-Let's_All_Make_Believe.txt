<song artist="Oasis" title="Let's_All_Make_Believe">
Is anyone here prepared to say
Just what they mean or is it too late?
For anyone here to try to do
Just what it takes to get through to you
So let's all make believe
That we're still friends and we like each other
Let's all make believe
In the end we gonna need each other
Strangle my hope and make me pray
To a god I've never seen but who I betray
To the people who live the afterlife
In a place I'll never be 'til I'm crucified
So let's all make believe
We're still friends and we like each other
Let's all make believe
In the end we'll need each other
Let's all make believe
That all mankind's gonna feed our brother
Let's all make believe
That in the end we won't grow old
So let's all make believe
That we're still friends and we like each other
Let's all make believe
In the end we'll need each other
Let's all make believe
That all mankind's gonna feed our brother
Let's all make believe
That in the end we won't grow old
