<song artist="Oasis" title="It's_Better_People">
It's better people love one another
'Cause livin' your life can be tough
It's better people speak to each other
Your shame is not enough
If everybody came alive
And stayed alive
And lived their lives instead, yeah
So come outside
And feel the light
It's cold inside
But it's lonely in your bed
In your bed
And though we might be
But what you heard before
Was only sleepin' in your brain
But if you came with me
The days'd never end
Would never be the same
They'd never be the same
They'd never be the same
Never be the same
It's better people love one another
'Cause livin' your life can be tough
It's better people speak to each other
Your shame is not enough
If everybody came alive
And stayed alive
And lived their lives instead, yeah
So come outside
And feel the light
It's cold inside
But it's lonely in your bed
In your bed
And though we might be
But what you heard before
Is sleeping in your brain
But if you came with me
The days'd never end
Would never be the same
They'd never be the same
They'd just go by a different name
They'd never be the same
