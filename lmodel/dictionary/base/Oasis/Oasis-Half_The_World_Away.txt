<song artist="Oasis" title="Half_The_World_Away">
I would like to leave this city
This old town don't smell too pretty, and
I can feel the warnin' signs
Runnin' around my mind
And when I leave this island
I'll book myself into a soul asylum
'Cause I can feel the warnin' signs
Runnin' around my mind
So here I go
I'm still scratchin' around in the same old hole
My body feels young, but my mind is very old
So what do you say?
You can't give me the dreams that are mine anyway
You're half the world away
Half the world away
Half the world away
I've been lost, I've been found
But I don't feel down
And when I leave this planet
You know I'd stay, but I just can't stand it, and
I can feel the warnin' signs
Runnin' around my mind
And if I could leave this spirit
I find me a hole, and I will fill it, and
I can feel the warnin' signs
Runnin' around my mind
Here I go
I'm still scratchin' around in the same old hole
My body feels young, but my mind is very old
So what do you say?
You can't give me the dreams that are mine anyway
You're half the world away
Half the world away
Half the world away
I've been lost, I've been found
But I don't feel down
No, I don't feel down
No, I don't feel down
I don't feel down
I don't feel down
I don't feel down
I don't feel down
