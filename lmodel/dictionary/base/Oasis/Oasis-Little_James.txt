Little James
We're all the same
Always seem to look to us
We weren't meant to be grown ups
Thank you for your smile
You make it all worthwhile to us
Live for your toys
Even though they make noise
Have you ever played with plasticine
Even tried a trampoline
Thank you for your smile
You make it all worthwhile to us
I'm singing this song
For you and your mum and that's all
It won't be long
Before everyone is gone
Sailed out to sea
Your mum, you, and me
You swam the oceans like a child
Life around us was so wild
Thank you for your smile
You make it all worthwhile to us
I'm singing this song
For you and your mum and that's all
It won't be long
Before everyone is gone
