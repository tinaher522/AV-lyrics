<song artist="Oasis" title="Shakermaker">
I'd like to be somebody else
And not know where I've been
I'd like to build myself a house
Out of plasticine
Ah, shake along with me
Ah, shake along with me
I've been driving in my car
With my friend, Mr. Soft
Mr. Clean and Mr. Ben
Are living in my loft
Ah, shake along with me
Ah, shake along with me
I'm sorry, but I just don't know
I know you said I told you so
When you're happy and you're feeling fine
Then you'll know it's the right time
Then you'll know it's the right time
To shake along with me
Shake along with me
Shake along with me
Shake along with me
Mr. Sifter sold me songs
When I was just sixteen
Now he stops at traffic lights
But only when they're green
Ah, shake along with me
Ah, shake along with me
Ah, shake along with me
Ah, shake along with me
Shake along with me
Shake along with me
Shake along with me
Shake along with them
Shake along with me
Shake along with them
Shake along with me
