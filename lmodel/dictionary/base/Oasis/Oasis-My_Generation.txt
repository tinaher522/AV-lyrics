<song artist="Oasis" title="My_Generation">
People try to put us d-down
Talkin' 'bout my generation
Just because we get around
Talkin' 'bout my generation
Things they do look awful cold
Talkin' 'bout my generation
I hope I die before I get old
Talkin' 'bout my generation
This is my generation
This is my generation, baby
Why don't you all fade away
Talkin' 'bout my generation
Yeah, and don't try and dig what we all say
Talkin' 'bout my generation
I'm not trying to cause a big sensation
Talkin' 'bout my generation
I'm just talkin' 'bout my generation
Talkin' 'bout my generation
My generation, this is my generation, baby
Why don't you all fade away
Talk-in' 'bout my generation
Yeah, and don't try and dig what we all say
Talkin' 'bout my generation
I'm not trying to cause a big sensation
Talkin' 'bout my generation
I'm just talkin' 'bout my generation
Talkin' 'bout my generation
This is my generation, this is my generation, baby
My my my generation
My my my
My my my generation
People try to put us down
Talkin' 'bout my generation
Just because we get around
Talkin' 'bout my generation
Things they do look awful cold
Talkin' 'bout my generation
Yeah, I hope I die before I get old
Talkin' 'bout my generation
This is my generation,
This is my generation, baby
My my my my generation
This is my generation
This is my
