<song artist="Oasis" title="Full_On">
I hear my heart beatin' faster
I feel it in my bones
I want it now cos I have ta
But why, no one knows
I'm like the angel on the A train
My eyes is diamond white
And from the cradle till you're insane
For life you have to fight
But no one knows why there's a spirit in the sky
Why there we stay for so long
And you will understand while I take you by the hand
Why life's time tunnel is long
And it will be alright
If you stay tonight
It's where we both belong
It's gonna be full on
It's gonna be full on
It's gonna be full on
It's gonna be full on
It's gonna be full on
I hear my heart beatin' faster
I feel it in my bones
I want it now cos I have ta
But why, no one knows
I'm like the angel on the A train
My eyes is diamond white
And from the cradle till you're insane
For life you have to fight
But no one knows why there's a spirit in the sky
Why there we stay for so long
And you will understand while I take you by the hand
Why life's time tunnel is long
And it will be alright
If you stay tonight
It's where we both belong
It's gonna be full on
It's gonna be full on
It's gonna be full on
It's gonna be full on
It's gonna be full on
It's gonna be alright
You're gonna stay tonight
It's where we both belong
It's gonna be full on
It's gonna be full on
It's gonna be full on
It's gonna be full on
It's gonna be full on
It's gonna be full on
It's gonna be full on
It's gonna be full on
