<song artist="Oasis" title="Underneath_The_Sky">
Underneath the sky of red
There's a storyteller sleepin' alone
He has no face and he has no name
And his whereabouts are sort of unknown
All he needs is his life in a suitcase
It belongs to a friend of a friend
And as we drink to ourselves
We'll amuse ourselves
Underneath the sky, underneath the sky again
Underneath the sky again
So wish me away to an unknown place
Am I livin' in a land with no name
I'll be making a start with my brand new heart
Stop me makin' sense once again
All we need is our lives in a suitcase
They belong to a friend of a friend
And as we drink to ourselves
We'll amuse ourselves
Underneath the sky, underneath the sky again
Underneath the sky again
All we need is our lives in a suitcase
They belong to a friend of a friend
And as we drink to ourselves
We'll amuse ourselves
Underneath the sky, underneath the sky again
Underneath the sky again
Underneath the sky again
Underneath the sky again
Underneath the sky again
Again, again
Underneath the sky again
