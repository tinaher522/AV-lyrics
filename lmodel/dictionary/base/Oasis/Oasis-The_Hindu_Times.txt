<song artist="Oasis" title="The_Hindu_Times">
I get up
When I'm down
I can't swim
But my soul won't drown
I do believe
I got flare
I got speed
And I walk on air
Cos God gimme soul in your rock 'n' roll, babe
Cos God gimme soul in your rock 'n' roll, babe
And I get so high I just can't feel it
And I get so high I just can't feel it
In and out my brain, runnin' through my vein
You're my sunshine, you're my rain
There's a love
That shines on
Shines on me
And it keeps me warm
It gimme peace
I must say
I can't sleep
Cos the world won't wait
Cos God gimme soul in your rock 'n' roll, babe
Cos God gimme soul in your rock 'n' roll, babe
And I get so high I just can't feel it
And I get so high I just can't feel it
In and out my brain, runnin' through my vein
You're my sunshine, you're my rain
And I get so high I just can't feel it
And I get so high I just can't feel it
And I get so high I just can't feel it
And I get so high I just can't feel it
In and out my brain, runnin' through my vein
You're my sunshine, you're my rain
