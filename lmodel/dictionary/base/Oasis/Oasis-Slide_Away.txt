<song artist="Oasis" title="Slide_Away">
Slide away and give it all you've got
My today fell in from the top
I dream of you and all the things you said
I wonder where you are now
Hold me down, all the world's asleep
Need you now, you knocked me off my feet
I dream of you, and we talk of growing old
But you said, "Please don't"
Slide in, baby, together we'll fly
I've tried praying, but I don't know what you're saying to me
Now that you're mine we'll find a way
Of chasing the sun
Let me be the one that shines with you
In the morning we don't know what to do
Two of a kind, we'll find a way
To do what we've done
Let me be the one that shines with you
And we can slide away
Slide away
Slide away
Away
Slide away, give it all you've got
My today fell in from the top
I dream of you and all the things you said
I wonder where you are now
Slide in, baby, together we'll fly
I've tried praying, and I know just what you're saying to me
Now that you're mine we'll find a way
Of chasing the sun
Let me be the one that shines with you
In the morning we don't know what to do
We're two of a kind, we'll find a way
To do what we've done
Oh, let me be the one that shines with you
And we can slide away
Slide away
Slide away
Slide away
Slide away
Slide away
Slide away
Slide away
Oo
Oo
(I don't know, I don't care)
(All I know is) slide away (you can take me there)
(I don't know, I don't care)
(All I know is) slide away (you can take me there)
(I don't know, I don't care)
(All I know is) slide away (you can take me there)
(I don't know, I don't care)
(All I know is) slide away (you can take me there)
(Take me there, take me there)
(Take me there, take) slide away (me there)
(Take me there, take me there)
(All I know is you can take) slide away (me there)
(Take me there, take me there)
(Take me there, take) slide away (me there)
(Take me there, take me there)
Slide away
Slide away
Slide away
