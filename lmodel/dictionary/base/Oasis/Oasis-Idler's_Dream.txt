<song artist="Oasis" title="Idler's_Dream">
My heart it skips a beat when I behold
The light that's shining through your eyes of gold
From heavenly blood you seem to spring
From heavenly waters you can drink
I'll meet you on a day that never ends
I'll greet you in the way that heaven meant
You lay me down gently on the leaves
You cover me over in my sleep
I never did sing I wish I could 
I never could pray cos it's just no good
I hope you don't break my heart of stone
I don't wanna scream out loud and wake up on my own mmhmm
And as I close my eyes
And the sky turns red 
I realise just what you are
You're an idler's dream and you're singing shangri-la 
shangri-la
shangri-la 
shangri-la
