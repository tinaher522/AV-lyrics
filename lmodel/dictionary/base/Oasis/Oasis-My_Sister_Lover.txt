<song artist="Oasis" title="My_Sister_Lover">
A feeling sleeping deep inside
You hide it so I'll never find
Today I think I'll waste my time
You never notice, you are blind
The dream I have can never be
To photograph what the eye can't see
I fight to live another day
I live to find out, come what may
Faith in our love is something I can never have
Faith in my sister is gonna set me free
Faith in our is something I will never have
Cause the lover I know don't got not faith in me
Your my lover, Your my lover
Your my lover, Your my lover
She gives me light when the sun goes down
She gives me strength when I don't drown
She gives me hope and destiny
She gives me air that I can breathe
Faith in our love is something I can never have
Faith in my sister is gonna set me free
Faith in our love is something I will never have
Cause the lover I know don't got not faith in me
Your my lover, I'm your brother
Your my lover, I'm your brother
Faith in our love is something I can never have
Faith in my sister is gonna set me free
Faith in our love is something I will never have
Cause the lover I know don't got not faith in me
Your my lover, I'm your brother
Your my lover, I'm your brother
Your my lover, I'm your brother
Your my lover, I'm your brother
