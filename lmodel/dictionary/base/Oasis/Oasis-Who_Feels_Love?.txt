<song artist="Oasis" title="Who_Feels_Love?">
Found what I'd lost inside
My spirit has been purified
Take a thorn from my pride
And hand in hand we'll take a walk outside
Thank you for the sun, the one that shines on everyone
Who feels love
Now there's a million years between my fantasies and fears
I feel love
I'm leaving all that I see
Now all my emotions fill the air I breathe
Now you understand that this is not the Promised Land
They spoke of
There's nothing more to be if you could be the remedy
Who heals love
I thank you for the sun, the one that shines on everyone
Who feels love
Now there's a million years between my fantasies and fears
I feel love
I thank you for the sun, the one that shines on everyone
Who feels love
Now there's a million years between my fantasies and fears
I feel love
