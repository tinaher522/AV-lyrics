<song artist="Oasis" title="Mucky_Fingers">
I know you think you deserve
An explanation on the meanings of life
But what you think that you heard
Slipped away out the back in your mind
You'll get your mucky fingers burned
You get your truth from the lies you were learned
And all your plastic believers
They'll leave us and they won't return
(Walk on)
And when you look in that mirror
And you're tying up your buttons and bows
And as you face your disease
You can squeeze into the emperor's clothes
You found your god in a paperback
You get your history from the Union Jack
And all your brothers and sisters
Have gone and they won't come back
I'm fed up with life in this city
'Cause all the phonies have blown my mind
When I'm gone, yeah, you look like you'd miss me
So come along with me but don't ask why
Cos it's all mine
It's all mine
It's all mine
It's all mine
Cos it's all mine
It's all mine
It's all mine
It's all mine
