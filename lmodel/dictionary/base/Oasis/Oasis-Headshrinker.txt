<song artist="Oasis" title="Headshrinker">
I know a girl who's lost and lonely
Sits by the phone on her own
But the phone don't ring
And the birds don't sing in her tree
She lost herself in a haze of pity
And doesn't know where to run
She's a headshrinker now
And I think it's time we had some fun
Lost in a fog, I've been treated like a dog
And I'm outta here
I got no name and I feel no shame
And I've got no fear
And I bow down to the tears of a clown
Whatever's going down is comin' around
I hope you don't regret today
For the rest of your lives
For the rest of your lives
For the rest of your lives
For the rest of your lives
Lost in a fog, I've been treated like a dog
And I'm outta here
I got no name and I feel no shame
And I've got no fear
And I bow down to the tears of a clown
Whatever's going down is comin' around
I hope you don't regret today
For the rest of your lives
I know a girl who's lost and lonely
Sits by the phone on her own
But the phone don't ring
And the birds don't sing in her tree
She lost herself in a haze of pity
And doesn't know where to run
She's a headshrinker now
And I think it's time we had some fun
Lost in a fog, I've been treated like a dog
And I'm outta here
I got no name and I feel no shame
And I've got no fear
And I bow down to the tears of a clown
Whatever's going down is comin' around
I hope you don't regret today
For the rest of your lives
For the rest of your lives
For the rest of your lives
For the rest of your lives
