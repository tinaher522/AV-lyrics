<song artist="Oasis" title="I_Can_See_A_Liar">
Baby, the time is right
To tell it all like it is
And now that I feel god like
There's nothing that can't be kissed
The name of a lonely soul
Is scratched into my brain
He thought he was king creole
Until he found out, 'til he found out
He sits upon a throne
He lives a sleazy lie
But he's all alone again
Again
I can see a liar
Sitting by the fire
Trouble in his heart
Laughin' at the thought, coming as he goes into overdose
I wonder what he thinks of me
Baby, the time is right
To tell it all like it is
And now that I feel god like
There's nothing that can't be kissed
He sits upon a throne
He lives a sleazy lie
But he's all alone again
Again
I can see a liar
Sitting by the fire
Trouble in his heart
He's laughin' at the thought, coming as he goes into overdose
I wonder what he thinks of me
Baby, you're a liar
Sitting by the fire
Trouble in your heart
You're laughing at the thought
Yeah, baby you're a liar
Sitting by the fire
Trouble in your heart
You're laughing at the thought, coming as you go into overdose
I wonder what you think of me
