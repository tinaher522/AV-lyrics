<song artist="Oasis" title="(As_Long_As_They've_Got)_Cigarettes_In_Hell">
Spend your days just walking and shopping
Depending on how much your luck is in
Spend the night-life table-hopping
And trying to keep that bag of bones in trim
I don't mind not feeling immortal
Cos it ain't all that as far as I can tell
I don't mind not going to heaven
As long as they've got cigarettes
As long as they've got cigarettes in hell
By the time we start getting used to
The dope that's forming on the windowsill
Now we know we've got ourselves into
The cage that keeps the mice on the treadmill
I don't mind not feeling immortal
Cos it ain't all that as far as I can tell
And I don't mind not going to heaven
As long as they've got cigarettes
As long as they've got cigarettes in hell
I don't mind not feeling immortal
Because it ain't all that as far as I can tell
And I don't mind not going to heaven
As long as they've got cigarettes
As long as they've got cigarettes in hell
