<song artist="Oasis" title="You've_Got_To_Hide_Your_Love_Away">
Shut up, shut up (spoken)
Here i stand with head in hand
Turn my face to the wall
If she's gone i can't go on
Feeling two-foot small
Everywhere people stare
Each and every day
I can hear them laugh at me
And i hear them say
Hey! you've got to hide your love away
Hey! you've got to hide your love away
How can i even try?
I can never win
Seeing them, hearing them
In the state i'm in
How could she say to me
Love will find a way?
So gather round all you clowns
Let me hear you say
Hey! you've got to hide your love away
Hey! you've got to hide your love away
La la la la la la la ... . . .
Thats the last song innit? (spoken)
