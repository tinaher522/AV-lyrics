<song artist="Oasis" title="I_Believe_In_All">
I can take 'em all
So I leave you with this thought
There's a fire in the sky
I don't need no alibi
See I believe in all
And do you hear me when I say
That I gotta walk this way
There's a fire in the sky
I don't need no alibi
See I believe in all
And I will catch you when you fall
That's what I'm gonna do
And I will catch you if you call
That's what I'm gonna do
I can see for miles
And I can see you and your crimes
There's a fire in the sky
I don't need no alibi
See I believe in all
Do you hear me when I say
That I gotta walk this way
There's a fire in the sky
I don't need no alibi
See I believe in all
And I will catch you when you fall
That's what I'm gonna do
And I will catch you if you call
That's what I'm gonna do
