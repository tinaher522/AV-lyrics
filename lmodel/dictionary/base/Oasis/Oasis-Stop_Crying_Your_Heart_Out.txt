<song artist="Oasis" title="Stop_Crying_Your_Heart_Out">
Hold up
Hold on
Don't be scared
You'll never change what's been and gone
May your smile (may your smile)
Shine on (shine on)
Don't be scared (don't be scared)
Your destiny may keep you warm
Cos all of the stars are fadin' away
Just try not to worry, you'll see them some day
Take what you need and be on your way and stop
Crying your heart out
Get up (get up)
Come on (come on)
Why're you scared (I'm not scared)
You'll never change what's been and gone
Cos all of the stars are fadin' away
Just try not to worry, you'll see them some day
Take what you need and be on your way and stop
Crying your heart out
Cos all of the stars are fadin' away
Just try not to worry, you'll see them some day
Just take what you need and be on your way
And stop crying your heart out
We're all of us stars, we're fadin' away
Just try not to worry, you'll see us some day
Just take what you need and be on your way and stop
Crying your heart out
Stop crying your heart out
Stop crying your heart out
Stop crying your heart out
