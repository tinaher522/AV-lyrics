An extra-ordinary guy
Can never have an ordinary day
He might live a long goodbye
But that is not for me to say
I dig his friends, I dig his shoes
But he is just a child with nothing to lose but his mind
His mind
They are sleeping while they dream
But then they want to be adored
They who don't say what they mean
Will live and die by their own sword
I dig their friends, I dig their shoes
But they are like a child with nothing to lose but their minds
Yeah, their minds
But I'll have my way
In my own time
I'll have my say
My star will shine
'Cause you see me
I've got my magic pie
Think of me
Yeah, that was me, I was that passer by
I've been and now I've gone
There are but a thousand days
Preparing for a thousand years
Many minds to educate
The people who have disappeared
To dig my friends, to dig my shoes
But I am like a child with nothing to lose in my mind
Yeah, my mind
We'll have our way
In our own time
We'll have our say
'Cause my star's gonna shine
'Cause you see me
I've got my magic pie
Think of me
Yeah, that was me, I was that passer by
I've been and now I've gone
You see me
I've got my magic pie
Think of me
Yeah, that was me, I was that passer by
Think of me
I've got my magic pie
Think of me
Yeah, that was me, I was that passer by
I've been and now I've gone
