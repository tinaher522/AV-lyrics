No I won't,
Let you down,
Hate to say you're surrounded by clowns.
Looks to me,
They've had their day,
Think it's time that you came out and played,
Won't you say, it's time that you came out and played,
Won't you say, it's time that you came out and played.
Let's get out of our minds,
Won't waste your time,
Give it a try,
I won't waste your time.
No I won't,
Let you down,
Hate to say you're surrounded by clowns.
Looks to me,
They've had their day,
Think it's time that you came out and played.
Won't you say, It's time that you came out and played,
Won't you say, It's time that you came out and played,
Let's get out of our minds,
Don't waste your time,
Give it a try,
Open your mind.
Won't let you down,
Don't let me down,
Won't let you down,
I won't let you down.
