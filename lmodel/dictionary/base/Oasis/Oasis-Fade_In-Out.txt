<song artist="Oasis" title="Fade_In-Out">
Get on the rollercoaster
The fair's in town today
You gotta be bad enough
To beat the brave
So get on the helter skelter
Bowl into the fray
You gotta be bad enough
To beat the brave
You fade in-out
You fade in-out
Without a doubt
I don't see no shine, today is just a daydream
Tomorrow we'll be castaway
Comin' in out of nowhere
Singin' rhapsody
You gotta be bad enough
To wanna be
Sittin' upside a high chair
The devil's refugee
Is gonna be blinded by the light
That follows me
She fade in-out
She fade in-out
Without a doubt
I don't see no shine, today is just a daydream
Tomorrow she'll be castaway
We fade in-out
We fade in-out
Without a doubt
I don't see no shine, today is just a daydream
Tomorrow we'll be castaway
So get on the rollercoaster
The fair's in town today
You gotta be bad enough
To beat the brave
Get on the helter skelter
Step into the fray
You gotta be bad enough
To beat the brave
You fade in-out
You fade in-out
You fade in-out
You fade in-out
You fade in-out
You fade in-out
You fade in-out
You fade in-out
You fade in-out
