<song artist="Oasis" title="She's_Electric">
She's electric
She's in a family full of eccentrics
She's done things I've never expected
And I need more time
She's got a sister
And God only knows how I've missed her
And on the palm of her hand is a blister
And I need more time
And I want you to know
I've got my mind made up now (mind made up now)
But I need more time
And I want you to say
Do you know what I'm saying (what I'm saying)
But I need more
'Cause I'll be you and you'll be me
There's lots and lots for us to see
Lots and lots for us to do
She is electric, can I be electric, too?
She's got a brother
We don't get on with one another
But I quite fancy her mother
And I think that she likes me
She's got a cousin
In fact she's got 'bout a dozen
She's got one in the oven
But it's nothing to do with me
And I want you to know
I've got my mind made up now (mind made up now
But I need more time
And I want you to say
Do you know what I'm saying (what I'm saying)
But I need more
'Cause I'll be you and you'll be me
There's lots and lots for us to see
There's lots and lots for us to do
She is electric, can I be electric, too?
Can I be electric, too?
Can I be electric, too?
Can I be electric, too?
