<song artist="Oasis" title="Heroes">
I, I wish I could swim
Just like a dolphin, like dolphins can swim
And nothing, is gonna keep us together
And we can beat them, for ever and ever
Cos we can be heroes, just for one day
I, I will be king
And you, you're gonna be my queen
Yeah but nothing, is gonna drive us away
Cos we can be heroes, just for one day
And we're gonna be ourselves, just for one day
I, I can remember (I remember)
When I was standing, by the wall (by the wall)
And then the guns, they shot over our heads (over our heads)
And then we kissed, as though nothing could fall (nothing could fall)
Well then the shame, yeah, the shame was on their side
But we're gonna beat them, for ever and ever
Then we could be heroes, just for one day
We can be heroes
We can be heroes
We can be heroes
Just for one day
We can be heroes
We're nothing, and nothing will help us
Maybe we're lying, then you better not stay
But we could be safer, just for one day
Oh-oh-oh-ohh, oh-oh-oh-ohh, just for one day
Though nothing, will keep us together
We could steal time, just for one day
We can be heroes, for ever and ever
What d'you say?
