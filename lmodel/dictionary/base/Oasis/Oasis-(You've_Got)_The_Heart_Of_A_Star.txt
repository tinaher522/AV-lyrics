<song artist="Oasis" title="(You've_Got)_The_Heart_Of_A_Star">
You never gonna get along, hangin' out, thinkin' out loud
You never gonna get it on and be someone stuck in that crowd
So you call out the feelings you hope that don't never exist
But don't be ashamed of your bones and your blisters
So come on come on my brothers and sisters
'Cause you can only be what you are
And you've got the heart of a star
But the light never hits you
And I said come on come on my brothers and sisters
If you could see what I could see maybe we could all get along
And maybe I could justify the bad things in life that I've done
So I call out the feelings I know that don't ever exist
I won't be ashamed of my bones and my blisters
So come on come on my brothers and sisters
'Cause you can only be what you are
'Cause you've got the heart the heart of a star
But the light never hits you
And I said come on come on my brothers and sisters
And the slower that you go
The greener the grass grows
And what we all need is love in our lives
So go about your business
'Cause life ain't your mistress
Come on come on my brothers and sisters
'Cause you can only be what you are
'Cause you've got the heart of a star
But the light never hits you
So be all you can
And just hold up your hands
Someday you'll understand why life never kissed you
And I said come on come on my brothers and sisters
Come on come on my brothers and sisters
I said come on come on my brothers and sisters
I said come on come on my brothers and sisters
I said come on come on my brothers and sisters
