<song artist="Oasis" title="Lyla">
Callin' all the stars to fall
And catch the silver sunlight in your hands
Come for me and set me free
Lift me up and take me where I stand
She believes in everything
And everyone, and you, and yours, and mine
I waited for a thousand years
For you to come and blow me out my mind
Hey, Lyla
A star's about to fall, so what d'you say, Lyla?
The world around us makes me feel so small, Lyla
If you can't hear me call, then I can't say, Lyla
Heaven help you catch me if I fall
She's the queen of all I've seen
And every song and city, far and near
Heaven-hell, my mademoiselle
She ring the bell for all the world to hear
Hey, Lyla
A star's about to fall, so what d'you say, Lyla?
The world around us makes me feel so small, Lyla
If you can't hear me call then I can't say, Lyla
Heaven help you catch me if I fall
Hey, Lyla
A star's about to fall, so what d'you say, Lyla
The world around us makes me feel so small, Lyla
If you can't hear me call, then I can't say, Lyla
Heaven help you catch me when I fall
Hey, Lyla
Hey, Lyla
Hey, Lyla
Hey, Lyla
