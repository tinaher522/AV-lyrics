<song artist="Oasis" title="Part_Of_The_Queue">
Suddenly I've found that I'd lost my way in this city
The streets and the thousands of colours all bleed into one
I fall down, heaven won't help me
I call out, no one would hear
All of a sudden I'd lost my way out of the city
Stand tall, stand proud
Every beginning is breaking its promise
I'm having trouble just finding some soul in this town
The names on the faces in places, they mean nothing to me
It's all they can do to be part of a queue in this town
I fall down, heaven won't help me
I call out, no one will hear
There'll be no tomorrow they say, well, I say more's the pity
Stand tall, stand proud
Every beginning has broken its promise
I'm having trouble just to finding my soul in this town
Stand tall, stand proud
Every beginning has broken its promise
I'm having trouble just to finding my soul in this town
Finding my soul in this town
But I'll keep on trying, I'll keep on trying
I'll keep on trying, I'll keep on trying
I'll keep on trying, I'll keep on trying
I'll keep on trying, I'll keep on trying
And I'll keep on
