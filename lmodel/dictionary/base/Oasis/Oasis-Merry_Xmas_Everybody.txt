<song artist="Oasis" title="Merry_Xmas_Everybody">
Are you hanging up your stockings on a wall?
It's the time that every centre has a ball
Does he ride a red nosed reindeer?
Do a 'ton up' on a sleigh
Do the fairies keep him sober for a day?
So here it is merry Christmas
Everybody's having fun
Look to the future now
It's only just begun
Are you waiting for your family to arrive?
Are you sure you got the room to spare inside?
Does your granny always tell ya that the old songs are the best?
She'll be up and rock 'n' rollin' with the rest
So here it is merry Christmas
Everybody's having fun
Look to the future now
It's only just begun
What will your daddy do
If he sees you're mama kissin' Santa Claus?
Ah ah
Are you hanging up your stockings on a wall ?
Are you hoping that the snow will start to fall ?
Do you ride on down the hillside in a buggy you have made ?
When you land upon your ass then you've been slayed
So here it is merry Christmas
Everybody's having fun
Look to the future now
It's only just begun
So here it is merry Christmas
Everybody's having fun
Look to the future now
It's only just begun
So here it is merry Christmas
Everybody's having fun
Look to the future now
It's only just begun
