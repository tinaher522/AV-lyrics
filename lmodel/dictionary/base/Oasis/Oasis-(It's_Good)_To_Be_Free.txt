<song artist="Oasis" title="(It's_Good)_To_Be_Free">
Head like a rock spinning round and round
I found it in a hole sitting upside down
You point the finger at me
But I don't believe
Paint me a wish on a velvet sky
You demand the answers, but I don't know why
In my mind (in my mind)
There is no time
The little things, they make me so happy
All I wanna do is live by the sea
Yeah, little things, they make me so happy
But it's good, yes, it's good
It's good to be free
So what would you say if I said to you
It's not in what you say, it's in what you do?
You point the finger at me
But I don't believe
Bring it on home to where we'd found
Head is like a rock sitting upside down
In my mind (in my mind)
There is no time
The little things, they make me so happy
All I wanna do is live by the sea
Yeah, little things, they make me so happy
But it's good, yes, it's good
It's good to be free
Yeah, it's good, yes, it's good
It's good to be free
