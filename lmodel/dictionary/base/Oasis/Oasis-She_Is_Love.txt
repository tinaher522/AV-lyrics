<song artist="Oasis" title="She_Is_Love">
When the sunshine beckons to you
And your wings begin to unfold
The thoughts you bring and the songs you sing
Are gonna keep me from the cold
And if the sword is hidden among you
And its words may wound my soul
You can fill me up with what you got
Cos my heart's been keeping old
She is love
And her ways are high and steep
She is love
And I believe her when she speaks
Love
And her ways are high and steep
She is love
And I believe, I do believe her when she speaks
You been in all my thoughts of passion
And the dreams of my delight
Whatever stirs my mortal frame
Well, you keep it warm at night
I don't know where you come from
And, no, I haven't got a clue
All I know is I'm in love
With someone who loves me too
She is love
And her ways are high and steep
She is love
And I believe her when she speaks
Love
And her ways are high and steep
She is love
And I believe, I do believe her when she speaks
She is love
And her ways are high and steep
She is love
And I believe her when she speaks
She is love
And her ways are high and steep
She is love
And I believe, I do believe her when she speaks
I do believe her when she speaks
I do believe her when she speaks
I do believe her when she speaks
