<song artist="Oasis" title="(Get_Off_Your)_High_Horse_Lady">
Get off your high horse, lady
I don't need a ride tonight
Get off your high horse, lady
I don't need a ride tonight
Lay down
Lay down
I hear your soul song singin'
From a fire in the sky
I hear your soul song singin'
From a fire in the sky
Rain down
Rain down
Get off your high horse, lady
I don't need a ride tonight
Get off your high horse, lady
I don't need a ride tonight
Lay down
Lay down
