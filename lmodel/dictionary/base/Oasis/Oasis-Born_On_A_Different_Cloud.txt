<song artist="Oasis" title="Born_On_A_Different_Cloud">
Born on a different cloud
From the ones that have burst round town
It's no suprise to me
That you're classless, clever, and free
Loaded just like a gun
You're the hero that's still unsung
Living on borrowed time
You're my sun and you're gonna shine
Talking to myself again
This time I think I'm gettin' through
It's funny how you think
It's funny how, it's funny how when you do
Born on a different cloud
From the ones that have burst round town
It's no suprise to me
That you're classless, clever, and free
Lonely soul
Busy workin' overtime
Nothin' ever gets done
Especially when your hands are tied
Lonely soul
Breaking up your mother's pride
Nothin' ever gets done
Not until your war's won
We're born on a different cloud
You're born on a different cloud
We're born on a different cloud
We're born on a different cloud
We're born on a different cloud
We're born on a different cloud
Born on a different cloud
We're born on a different cloud
