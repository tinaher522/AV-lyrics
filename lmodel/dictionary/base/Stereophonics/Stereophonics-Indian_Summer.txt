<song artist="Stereophonics" title="Indian_Summer">
Every time that I see her
A lightening bolt fills the room
The underbelly of Paris
She sings her favorite tune
She'll drink you under the table
She'll show you a trick or two
But every time that I left her
I missed the things she would do
She was the one - for me
She opened my eyes - to see
She was the one - for me
Well alright
It was a cold September
Before the Indian summer
That's the thing I remember
Then she gave me her number
Went from station to station
On a train 'cross the nation
Then the rain of November
That's the time that we ended
She was the one - for me
Well alright
Vodka with Coca Cola
Cocaine tucked in her shoes
Cigarettes over coffee
Her halo slipped to a noose
Take a slow boat to China
You fly a rag 'round the moon
She could take it or leave it
I knew it had to end soon
She was the one - for me
She opened my eyes - to see
She was the one - for me
Well alright
It was a cold September
Before the Indian summer
That's the thing I remember
When she gave me her number
Went from station to station
On a train 'cross the nation
And the rain of November
That's the time that we ended
She was the one - for me
She opened my eyes - to see
She was the one - for me
Well alright, alright, alright, yeah
