<song artist="Stereophonics" title="Billy_Davey's_Daughter">
I never knew her name
I only knew her fame
She lived near my town
Another goldfish to drown
Well I just past the bridge
That parts us from them
The bridge that she used
Again and again
Again
I remember when they found her
Billy Davey's daughter
The word gets around
Billy Davey's second daughter
Threw herself to dirty water
Billy's left with nothing but a dream
He dreams ...
