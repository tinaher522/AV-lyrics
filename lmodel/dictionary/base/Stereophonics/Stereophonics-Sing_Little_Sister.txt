<song artist="Stereophonics" title="Sing_Little_Sister">
I wanna feel you next to me
I wanna be cheek to cheek
You got to sing little sister
(so come on next to me)
You got to dance little sister
(so come on next to me)
You got to sing little sister
(so come on next to me)
You got to scream
I feel you breathe right next to me
You're all I need to cheek
You got to sing little sister
(so come on next to me)
You got to dance little sister
(so come on next to me)
You got to sing little sister
(so come on next to me)
You got to scream
Sing sister
It's you it's me it's all I see
It's all I need - yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
You got to sing little sister
(so come on next to me)
You got to dance little sister
(so come on next to me)
You got to sing little sister
(so come on next to me)
Yes you're my sweet little sister
I remember how ya kissed me
Come on next to me little sister
Next to me…
How could anyone resist ya?
I never knew this existed!
Since you been gone how I missed ya
You're next to me…
How could anyone resist ya?
