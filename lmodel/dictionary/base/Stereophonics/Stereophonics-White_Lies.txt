<song artist="Stereophonics" title="White_Lies">
I don't know where you are
Or what you wanna do
It seems so these days
I'm losing out on you
Oh yeah, oh yeah yeah
You come home so late
I don't know where you been
I wanna hold you tight
But you make me wanna scream
Yeah yeah
Oh… so now we're fighting in the streets
I can't breathe
'Cause I don't believe words you say
No… your white lies don't protect me
Be honest with me
It's all we can be to sustain
I drove around all morning
Thinking of starting again
Turning my back on a good thing
I turned the car 'round instead
No… your white lies don't protect me
Be honest with me it's all we can be to sustain
Oh… so no more fighting in the streets
And I can't breath 'cause I don't believe
Words you say
No… your white lies don't protect me
Be honest with me it's all we can be to sustain
Oh… so no more fighting in the streets
'Cause I can't breathe
If I don't see you again
