<song artist="Stereophonics" title="She's_Alright">
Sandy was from out of town
And I met her at the beach
She drove a white Mondeo ride
Which I thought was kinda cheap
She danced a while and drank some wine
Before she rolled her eyes at me
I picked them up and I rolled them back
And then we swam into the sea
She's Alright x5
She's Okay, She's with me
She's Alright x5
She's Okay, She's with me
We talked all night into the morning light
Until it was time to find some food
We drank coffee until it made me shake
And I rolled into a beer
She got drunk and loud and laughed
And then it all turned into tears
And then she got into a bar-room brawl
So I said "It's okay, she's with me"
She's Alright x5
She's Okay, She's with me
She's Alright x5
She's Okay, She's with me
She's Alright x5
She's Okay, She's with me
She's Alright x5
She's Okay, She's with me
Oooooh x4
They said "Get out",
I said "She's alright"
They said "Get out",
I said "She's alright"
They said "Get out",
I said "She's alright"
They said "Get out",
I said "She's alright"
She's Alright x5
(They said "Get out", I said "She's alright")
She's Okay, She's with me
She's Alright x5
(They said "Get out", I said "She's alright")
She's Okay, She's with me
She's Alright x5
(They said "Get out", I said "She's alright")
She's Okay, She's with me
She's Alright x5
(They said "Get out", I said "She's alright")
She's Okay, She's with me
