<song artist="Stereophonics" title="Take_Me">
The day is dawning in the rainy park
Trees around, some falling down
It's ok, I don't mind
You can take your clothes and run
Falling over spinning round
Orange leaves spread on the ground
Sleep in the day, swim in the night
Light your fires, it could be tragic, today
Take me here
Take me here
Bowled me over from the start
Poison arrow through the heart
I'll undress you, you'll undress me
The place is dark, no one can see
Lay me down on the grassy ground
The stars aligned for miles around
I don't know you, you don't know me
Who's to know what will be, today?
Take me here
Take me here
Take me here
Take me here
