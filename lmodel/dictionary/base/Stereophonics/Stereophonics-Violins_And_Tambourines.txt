<song artist="Stereophonics" title="Violins_And_Tambourines">
Looking out the window
Staring at the road
Doesnâ€™t really matter
Which way to, go
Everything is changing
Nothing ever seems to stay the same
Violins and tambourines
Candy canes and magazines
Preaching sermons on the street
I killed a man but life is cheap
They say
Stopped on the way home
Side of the road
Met her at the drug store
Saving people's souls
She offered me redemption
I'll take a drink instead if that's okay
Violins and tambourines
Candy canes and magazines
Preaching sermons on the street
I killed a man but life is cheap
They say
Violins and tambourines
Candy canes and magazines
Preaching sermons on the street
I killed a man but life is cheap
Violins and tambourines
Children sing songs in the street
Innocence is underrated
Knock me out, I'll be sedated
Violins and tambourines
Pounding drums in unity
She's just so emancipated
Every time we meet she wants to save me
She wants to save me
Can't she save me?
Won't you save me?
