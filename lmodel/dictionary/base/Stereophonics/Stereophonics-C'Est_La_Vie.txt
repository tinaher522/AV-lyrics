<song artist="Stereophonics" title="C'Est_La_Vie">
Yeah you believe you're the king of the jungle
You got the T-shirt do you know how the song goes?
You're looking good but the fact is you're lazy
But people love you 'cause you're funny and crazy
Seven eleven buy a six pack of beer
If there's a party you're the last one to leave it
It's not too late we, we can stop all the dreaming
Get out this town, look around we don't need it
Hell and heaven they can wait for you
So go and do all the things that you want to do
We don't belong anywhere...
So set me free, c'est la vie I said come on
pretty baby take a chance on me
I said shame on me, 'cause I didn't see that 
you were looking at me baby by the Ferris wheel
I know you're cool, but you think that you're chocolate
Get off my nerves 'cause I still got a soft spot
You look at me you and think I got all the answers
Maybe I do but I'm scared taking chances
Boat in a bottle but we ain't sailing nowhere
Rip out the cork, get the wind into our hair
Get off the train in the rain at the station
Knock back ya drink 'cause we think the boat's sinking
Hell and heaven they can wait for you
So go and do all the things that you want to do
We don't belong anywhere...
So set me free c'est la vie I said come on 
pretty baby take a dance with me
I said shame on me cause I didn't see that 
you were looking at me baby by the Ferris wheel
I said a stand by me and stick around with me
'cause it's a long walk back to where we just been
I said a hey there baby so you're banged him and me
I just wish I never found out but hey c'est la vie
I said they're playing our song on the radio
And we're singing out loud all the words that we know
And it's a long tall Sally pissing off Peggy Sue
Or isn't that me and you 'cause it's time that we grew
And you said yeah yeah yeah come along with me
And then you think all the things that you wanna see
I said a whoa pretty baby come and take my hand
I'm gonna shake you all night baby yes I am
Whooa!
Such is life in the rear view mirror
The open road up ahead is the future
Time came round and wrecked our place
But when I look back now I got a smile on my face
Come on baby take a chance with me
Stick around on the town if ya wanna see
We don't belong anywhere is what she said to me
So come on take a dance and spin around with me
She said shine on baby, set me free chest la vie
I said stand by me and stick around with me
And when the street lights fall you can buy my beer
And when the morning light comes I'll be gone c'est la vie
Yeah, yeah
We don't belong anywhere
We don't belong anywhere
We don't belong anywhere
Set me free we don't belong anywhere
We don't belong anywhere
We don't belong anywhere
We don't belong anywhere
