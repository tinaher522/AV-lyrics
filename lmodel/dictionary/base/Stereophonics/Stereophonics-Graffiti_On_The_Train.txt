<song artist="Stereophonics" title="Graffiti_On_The_Train">
Oh the graffiti on the train
Oh the graffiti on the train oh no
Rolled in to her life
Oh the graffiti on the train 
Oh
Sets out he left his lover sleeping
Rain falls he's drowning in his secret
Wet streets are quiet as a church hall
Last house where children kick the football
Crossroads his heart is beating faster
Getting close to asking her the question
"Marry me" he wants to paint the words on
The night train he's hiding with his spray can
Tonight he's gonna ride
When the paint is done and dried oh come on
Oh oh oh the graffiti on the train
Oh the graffiti on the train
Oh the graffiti on the train
Oh she'll never be the same oh no
Rolled in to her life
Oh the graffiti on the train oh
Day breaks his lover yawns and wakes up
Sips her cup and dusts her face in make up
Platform she hears the people whisper
Someone died they surfed the train and slipped up
Train comes the coach she's always used to
The doors read "Marry me I love you"
Heart stops ecstatic and suspicious
She makes the call but he don't pick the phone up
The train sped down the line
It was last train he would ride oh no
Oh oh oh the graffiti on the train
Oh the graffiti on the train
Oh the graffiti on the train
Oh she'll never be the same oh no
Rolled into her life
Oh the graffiti on the train oh
