<song artist="Stereophonics" title="Hammerhead">
Banging in my head
I can't get no sleep
The big man with the hammer
Is making me weak
Wherever I stay
The drilling never stops
Home or away
I'm gonna lose the plot
How many nails?
How many ways?
How long's it take?
Ya keeping me awake
Hammerhead
Laying in my bed
While I'm getting head
The banging follows me
I can't get no sleep
It's driving me insane
Every night and day
I wanna nail you down
So you can't make a sound
How many nails?
How many ways?
How long's it take?
Ya keeping me awake
Hammerhead
