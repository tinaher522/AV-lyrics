<song artist="Stereophonics" title="Live_'N'_Love">
Change what ya can,
but the rest you just gotta let go,
Taste every drop of life you can you know,
'Cause time is short it'll soon be time to go
Don't be afraid to dream and live life here and now 'cause that's what's real, all the rest of it is just all make believe
So live here in the moment
and live that dream my angel
Be my saviour
Take my soul and live 'n' love today
So live your dream my angel
Be my saviour
Take my soul and live 'n' love today
You'll never understand it all when things go right or wrong,
take that from me
In love 'n' life there ain't much sympathy
So grab your coat it's cold
and live that dream my angel
Be my saviour
Take my soul and live 'n' love today
So live your dream my angel
Be my saviour
Take my soul and live 'n' love today
You'll never understand it all
Read the writing on the wall
See the world and be what you wanna be
Don't be afraid to dream
Live 'n' love and live free
The rest is all make believe to me
So live your dream my angel
Be my saviour
Take my soul and live 'n' love today
So live your dream my angel
Be my saviour
Take my soul and live 'n' love today
