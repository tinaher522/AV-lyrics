<song artist="Stereophonics" title="Video_Games">
Swinging in the backyard
Pull up in my fast car
Whistling your name
Open up a beer
You say "get over here"
And play a video games
You are in my favourite sun dress
Watching you get undressed
Take that body downtown
I say "You the bestest"
Lean in for a big kiss
Put my favourite perfume on
Go play a video game
It's you, it's you, it's all for you
Everything I do
I tell you all the time
Heaven is a place on earth with you
Tell me all the things you want to do
I heard that you like the bad girls
Honey, is that true?
It's better than I ever even knew
They say that the world was built for two
Only worth living if somebody
Is loving you
Baby, now you do
Singing in the old bars
Swinging with the old stars
Living for the fame
Kissing in the blue dark 
Playing pool and wild darts
Video games
I hold you in my arms
Drunk and I am seeing stars
This is all I think of
Watching all our friends fall
In and out of old Paul's
This is our idea of fun
Playing video games
It's you, it's you, it's all for you
Everything I do, I tell you all the time
Heaven is a place on earth with you
Tell me all the things you want to do
I heard that you like the bad girls
Honey, its that true?
It's better than i ever even knew
They that the world was built for two
Only worth living if somebody
Is loving you
Baby, now you do
Oh baby, now you do
Yeah baby, now you do
Yeah baby, now you do
It's you, its you, its all for you
Everything I do
I tell you all the time
Heaven is a place on earth with you
Hell me all the things you want to do
I heard that you like the bad girls
Honey, its that true?
It's better than i ever even knew
They say that the world was built for two
Only worth living if somebody
Is loving you
Oh baby, now you do
Yeah baby, now you do
