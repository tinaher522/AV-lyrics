<song artist="Stereophonics" title="I_Got_Your_Number">
You think your pretty special, mixing your social circle
I watch you dance the night away
You seem to hypnotise me, we drank until the sunday
And when i woke you'd gone away
But i know, and you know
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
You told me lies right to my face,
i've got your number your a fake
One too many times i took the bate
You told me lies right to my face,
i've got your number your a fake
You act like your so happy, you play them all so badly
put down your pills and walk away
you line up on your mirror
inventing all your grandeur?
Why don't you stare in to your face
But i know, and you know
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
You told me lies right to my face,
i've got your number your a fake
One too many times i took the bate
You told me lies right to my face,
i've got your number your a fake, fake
I know, yes i know
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
i've got your number your a fake
One too many times i took the bate
You told me lies right to my face,
i've got your number your a fake
