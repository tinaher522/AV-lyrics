<song artist="Stereophonics" title="Check_My_Eyelids_For_Holes">
I gotta lose weight, I, I swallow honey
Is my stand up show, still, still, still that funny
Am I back for good?
I said that I, said that I would be
She's down waist low trying to make me happy
Because I like watching you.
It's time I tried, gotta check my, check my eyelids, check for holes
It's time I tried, gotta check my, check my eyelids, check for holes.
Two weeks late I, I, I gotta test for babies, shop take is falling low.
I'm not going back, back to the factories, because I like what I do
It's time I tried, tried to check my, check my eyelids, check for holes
It's time I tried, tried to check my, check my eyelids, check for holes
It's time I tried, tried to check my, check my eyelids, check for holes
It's time I tried, tried to check my, check my eyelids, check for holes
It's time I tried,
It's time I tried,
It's time I tried,
It's time I tried,
It's time I tried,
It's time I tried,
It's time I tried to check my lids for holes
