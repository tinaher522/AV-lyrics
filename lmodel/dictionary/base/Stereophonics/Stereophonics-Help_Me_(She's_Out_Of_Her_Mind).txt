<song artist="Stereophonics" title="Help_Me_(She's_Out_Of_Her_Mind)">
Dancing in the mirror 
You could see her from a mile man 
She was alright 
She looked right over her shoulder 
Right at me 
I was falling through the floor now 
She came, over me 
Help me, oh help me, 
She's out of her mind 
Help me, oh help me 
Somebody tonight 
Laughing, all night 
She could tell a funny story 
She could stay up all night 
She was someone to remember 
She was black and white 
We did it on a sunbed 
And she did it right 
Help me, oh help me, 
She's out of her mind 
Help me, somebody 
Oh help me, tonight 
Prancing, around a low lit light 
Running rags over her shoulders 
Red chilli lights 
She drink you underneath the table 
She hold you heavenly tight 
Slap you right across ya white face 
She make you cry like a child 
Help me, oh help me, 
She's out of her mind 
Help me, oh help me 
Somebody, tonight 
Crazy, out of her mind 
You wanna shoot her, wanna love her 
You can't make up your mind 
You wanna tell her all your stories 
Wanna open your mind 
You wanna show her how your heart works 
But she ain't got the time 
You're fighting, all the time 
There's nothing working, nothing gaining 
Just a waste of time 
You're trying hard to remember 
All the beautiful times 
But yer clouded by the bullshit 
All of the time 
Loving, on a Saturday night, making love under a blanket 
With the telly on loud 
You wanna show her that you love her 
But there's sex on ya mind 
Makin' love from watching movies 
I think I'm doin' it right 
Help me, oh help me 
She's out of, her mind 
Help me, so help me 
Somebody tonight
