<song artist="Stereophonics" title="You_Stole_My_Money_Honey">
You stole my money honey 
You're cold your blood's stopped running 
And now you're buying your new life 
Can't help but find you funny 
The clothes you wear are something 
You made your whole life boasting lies 
Pretend you're high on something 
To think you think I'm dumb, you're blind 
I get by fine without you 
I lie about you 
You got no spine only mine 
Don't you know wrong from right 
It's up to you, you're such a fool 
See I'm a giver, taker! 
You liked your cocaine chaser 
The girls you love all sleep around 
You got a piece of something 
But what it's worth is nothing 
Coz what you want you just can't buy 
Pretend you're high on something 
To think you think I'm dumb, you're blind 
I get by fine without you 
I lie about you 
You got no spine only mine 
Don't you know wrong from right 
You got no style about you 
I try to like you 
I got no time for you now 
Cos your time's running out 
It's up to you 
You're such a fool 
I get by fine without you 
I lie about you 
You got no spine only mine 
Don't you know wrong from right 
You got no style about you 
I try to like you 
I got no time for you now 
Cos your time's running out 
It's up to you 
It's up to you 
Such a fool, it's up to you
