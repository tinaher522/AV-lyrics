<song artist="Stereophonics" title="Mr._And_Mrs._Smith">
She's got style
She's got grace
She's got every little thing
But a smile upon her face
She's got wine
Rolling Stones
She's got all the right underwear
She bought just today to show
Every night there doing just the same
But they meet every Friday night under false names
So Mr and Mrs Smith come down
We got your room already for you have a wonderful time
She's got heart
She's got soul
But she's married to the banker man
Who only cares to dig for gold
And every night they're doing just the same
But they meet every friday night under false names
So Mr and Mrs Smith come down
We got your room already for you have a wonderful time
So Mr and Mrs Smith get a round
We got ya drinks all lined up for you in the bar, paint the town
Enjoy the luxury, the atmosphere
And every room got personality
Stay up all night, sleep all day
It's up to you, it's all okay
She likes to sing
She likes to dance
She says to him with every chance
Give me one more night
One more song, one more drink
Shake me all night long
All night long, all night long, all night long
He's got time, she's got taste
He brings the devil out of her
And puts a smile across her face
So Mr and Mrs Smith come down
Wr got your room already for you have a wonderful time
Enjoy the luxury, the atmosphere
And every room got personality
Stay up all night, sleep all day
It's up to you, it's all okay
She likes to sing
She likes to dance
She says to him with every chance
Give me one more night, one more song
One more drink, shake me all night long
Shake me all night long
