<song artist="Stereophonics" title="Rainbows_And_Pots_Of_Gold">
I heard ya doing well 
Selling art and everything 
I like ya stuff, good for you 
I'll buy a piece or maybe two 
Do you ever think of me? 
D'ya remember all our stupid dreams? 
Rainbows and pots of gold 
So much to prove before we got old 
I took ya places round the world 
I miss ya face sometimes ya know 
You took my picture a thousand times 
I'll buy them back' I don't mind 
I lost my way but found my track 
I'm sorry if I never listened back 
I've been round, I've been up and down 
And you missed the one we dressed like clowns 
How's ya car? How's ya life? 
How's my friend? when's she gonna be your wife? 
I'm sitting up writing down 
Things I sometimes dream about 
I knew ya number off by heart 
That's the only one I liked to talk 
It wasn't me using you 
I trusted you one of the few 
We had some laughs, had some rows 
But in the end the walls came down 
You'd like the place I'm living now 
It's a shame you can't come around 
I've grown a lot since we last spoke 
Got myself together fixed what was broke 
I wonder if we'll talk again 
Drink together, just like then 
Suppose it's different, now it's new 
Whoever points the finger at who 
I really hope ya happy both of you 
And maybe sometimes you miss me too
