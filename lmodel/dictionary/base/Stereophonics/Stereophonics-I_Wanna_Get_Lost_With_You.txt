<song artist="Stereophonics" title="I_Wanna_Get_Lost_With_You">
Do you remember the light of the flame?
Was a birthday party of someone
Then you told me your name
Thought you were one in a million
I wanna get lost with you
It's the only thing I wanna do
Get out of my mind with you
So come on over
I walked you home in the rain
Speaking the same language
You were running around in my brain
Then you sent me your message
You said...
I wanna get lost with you
It's the only thing I wanna do
Get out of my mind with you
So come on over
I wanna get lost with you
It's the only thing I wanna do
Get out of my mind with you
So come on over
I know we did some wrong
You told me that now when I came to you
That you were with someone
It got messed up
With so much stuff, like living a loaded gun
But now that I'm out of my mind with you
We got that day in the sun
I wanna get lost with you
It's the only thing I wanna do
Get out of my mind with you
So come on over
I wanna get lost with you
It's the only thing I wanna do
Get out of my mind with you
So come on over, so come on over
So come on over, come on over
I wanna get lost with you
I wanna get lost with you
Wanna get lost with you
Yeah, so come on over
