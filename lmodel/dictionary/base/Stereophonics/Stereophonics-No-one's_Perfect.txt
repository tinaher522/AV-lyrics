<song artist="Stereophonics" title="No-one's_Perfect">
If I could
You know I would
I'd give up and be free
Every time I take a drink
I sink into the sea
It's ok
We've got days to be
Oooh no one's perfect
Tomorrow, you'll see
Let you down a thousand times
In rationality
All I've done I've blamed no one
All roads lead back to me
It's ok
We've got days to be
Ooooh no one's perfect
Tomorrow, you'll see
You've made a better man of me
You've made a better man of me
Nothing
Lasts forever
Tomorrow
You will see
If I could
You know I would
I'd give up and be free
Ooooh
No one's perfect
Tomorrow, you'll see
You've made a better man of me
You've made a better man of me
