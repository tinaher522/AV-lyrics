<song artist="Stereophonics" title="Wonder">
I wanted it all, wanted what I could not controlI just cannot control it all
Levelled it off to a place where I could feel alive
and I'm not weighed down at all
Learning a lot, learning that I've just gotta let go
I cannot carry it all, It's not who I was
Taking me back to this place
Where I loved when I was just a boy
Don't you wanna just remember
Who you are?
I wanna be back in our summer
Do you remember?
Come with me
No room for thunder
No going under
I wanna be, free, breathe
Dream About our summer
I'll always wonder
Yeah we wandered around
Swimming at night under the stars
and no-one there to bring us down
We'll never be down
Now I know that when I think back
All this stuff's a state of mind
Don't you wanna just remember
Who you are?
I wanna be back in our summer
Do you remember?
Come with me
No room for thunder
Not going under
I wanna be, as good as it was
It wasn't enough, I wanted it all
I wanted too much, I'll never forget
About our summer
I'll always wonder about our summer.
