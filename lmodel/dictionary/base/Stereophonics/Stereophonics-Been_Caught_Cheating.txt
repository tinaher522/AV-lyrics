<song artist="Stereophonics" title="Been_Caught_Cheating">
I know your time
Is on your mind
Since I'm away
I heard a cry
Yes, you've been caught
Caught cheating 
On me
Now I know your kind
You get around
But I give you
All of my time
Yes, you've been caught
Caught cheating
On me
Now I love you
Like the way I'm meant to do
Yes, I love you
Like the way I'm meant to do
But you've been caught
Caught cheating
On me
I know you lie
Down the line
When I get back
You look in my eyes
Yes, you've been caught
Caught cheating
On me
Yes, you've been caught
Caught cheating on me
But I love you
Like the way I'm meant to do
Yes I love you
Like the way I'm meant to do
But you've been caught
Caught cheating
On me
