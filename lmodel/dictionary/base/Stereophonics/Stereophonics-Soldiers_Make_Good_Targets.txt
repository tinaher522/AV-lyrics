<song artist="Stereophonics" title="Soldiers_Make_Good_Targets">
What kind of pace are we living now?
Watching wars live, via satellite
You carry a gun but no smoking inside
Escape disease yet I could get shot tonight
You
Shoot
You
Lose
The time has come and you're all alone
And you know you're not dreaming
It's heaven's door, you're ringing on the bell
Will they let you in, or you going to hell?
I'll take a war, I'll take mine with fries
Medium rare, wash a coke down with ice
Swallow it down no time to digest
What do you know, I'm feeling hungry again
You
Shoot
You
Loose
The time has come and you're all alone
And you know you're not dreaming
It's heaven's door, you're ringing on the bell
Will they let you in, or you going to hell?
