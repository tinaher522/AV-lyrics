<song artist="Stereophonics" title="Could_You_Be_The_One?">
Every little thing you do is magic lately
Every single thing that you do is cool
Every little thing you do is tragically hip
Even when you tend to play the fool
When you open up your tired eyes
And take a look at what’s inside
The mirror on your wall tells you the truth
You’re exactly where you wana be
There is no room for streams of tears
The sun is shining down, the clouds have cleared
Could you be the one for me
Could you be the one for me
Could you be the one for me
Could you be the one
Could you be the one for me
Could you be the one for me
Could you be the one for me
Could you be the one
Every single thing you do is magic baby
Every little thing that you do is cool
Every little thing you do is fashionably hip
Even when you’re mixing greens with blues
When you open up your pain stained eyes
From the night before when you were high
The smile upon your face tells you the truth
You’re exactly where you wana be
There aint no fear of misery
The sun is shining down, the clouds have cleared
Could you be the one for me
Could you be the one for me
Could you be the one for me
Could you be the one
Could you be the one for me
Could you be the one for me
Could you be the one for me
Could you be the one, oohhh....
(Could you be the one for me)
(Could you be the one for me)
(Could you be the one for me)
(Could you be the one)
Could you be the one for me
Could you be the one for me
Could you be the one for me
Could you be the one
