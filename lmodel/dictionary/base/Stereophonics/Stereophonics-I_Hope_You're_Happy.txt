<song artist="Stereophonics" title="I_Hope_You're_Happy">
i hope you're happy
i hope he kisses like i couldn't
i hope he holds you like i wouldn't
i hope you can run away
where you'll both be free
i hope you don't think of me
don't think of me
i hope you're happy
i hope he makes you smile
i hope you're happy for a while
i hope he doesn't hurt
when you run away
where you'l be free
i hope you don't think of him
don't think of him
nothings gonna change
nothings gonna change
why's nothing gonna change?
nothing's gonna change
why d'you run away?
why d'you run from me?
why d'you leave me here still looking for you
i'm always looking
i'll always be looking
always be looking
for you
yeah, you
yeah, you
yeah, you
yeah, you
i hope you're happy
