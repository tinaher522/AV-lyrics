<song artist="Stereophonics" title="Zoe">
Zoe is like no other
She says she's always right
She'll take you to the limit
She'll bring your devil's out
She likes to light you fires
She likes to burn you out
She'll make you feel like heaven
Can bury you alive
It's my mind, my mind
It's my time, my time
It's my life, my life
My life, my life
Zoe is like no other
She says she's always right
She'll take you to the limit
She'll bring your devil's out
Zoe took my money
She bought herself a life
She left me here with nothing
She left me high and dry
Was harsh time, harsh time
What's mine, mine.
Mine, mine
So bye, bye
Bye, bye
You die, die
Die, die
Zoe is like no other
She says she's always right
She'll take you to the limit
She'll bring your devil's out
Zoe is like no other
She says she's always right
She'll take you to the limit
She bury you alive
Just look at me
Just look at me
Just look at me
Just look at me (she'll bring your devil's out)
Just look at me (devil's out)
Just look at me (devil's out)
Just look at me (devil's out)
Zoe is like no other
She says she's always right
She'll take you to the limit
She'll bury you alive
La la la la (x8)
