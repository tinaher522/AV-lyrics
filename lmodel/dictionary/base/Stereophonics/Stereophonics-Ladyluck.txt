<song artist="Stereophonics" title="Ladyluck">
We're falling now, can't make it stop
Our arms are open for the thing we want
But what we want just can't have
What could've been but the timing's bad
Don't cry cry baby now
You're my my Lady Luck
We follow the signs to make us meet
Into the night, to places no-one sees
I never learned from looking back
You picked me up from off my back
But now it seems our time has passed
Don't cry cry baby now
You're my my Lady Luck
You picked me up right off my back
I'd fallen down you brought me up
We shared the night until the morning comes to take us back
Away to where 
We chose to belong
And maybe we're wrong, but we gotta be strong
There's too much to lose
And maybe we're fools, who knows? Who knows? Who knows?
Who knows? Who knows? 
We follow the signs to make us meet
Into the night, to places no-one sees
