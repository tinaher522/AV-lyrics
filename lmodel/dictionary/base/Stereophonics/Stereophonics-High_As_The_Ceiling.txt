<song artist="Stereophonics" title="High_As_The_Ceiling">
Come on get up high as the ceiling, get up on the floor 
Think I lost my mind and my feeling, been there all before 
Find my way 
Free my soul 
Blind and loaded 
Lined and sorted 
It's time... 
If you think you'll make a fool out of me 
I got a little something up my sleeve 
I can think of better places to be 
So get yourself down on the street 
Come on take my hand if you need me 
Just knock up on my door 
You got to stop your mind from dreaming 
And live your life some more 
Find my way 
Free my soul 
Wine and water 
Shine light on my time...
If you think you'll make a fool out of me 
I got a little something up my sleeve 
I can think of better places to be 
So get yourself down on the street 
Come on get up high as the ceiling 
Leave me a light at home 
I'm running out of time and I need it 
I need a lifetime more 
Find my way 
Free my soul 
Eyes wide open 
Time is on my side... 
If you think you'll make a fool out of me 
I got a little something up my sleeve 
I can think of better places to be 
So get yourself down on the street 
Come on get up high as the ceiling, get up on the floor 
Come on get up high as the ceiling, get up on the floor
Come on get up high as the ceiling, get up on the floor
Think I lost my mind and my feeling 
Been there all before
