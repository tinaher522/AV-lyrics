<song artist="Stereophonics" title="Jayne">
She took herself out in the car
She drove herself around the block
She said she's leaving me again
Then she got lost
I look for her out on the porch
I wanna see her face once more
She said she's leaving me again
Then she got lost
Then she got lost
She took the midnight train to nowhere
She said that she was leaving home
Yeah she's leaving me tomorrow
But tomorrow never came
For Jayne
I wait for her now and then
I hope to see her round the bend
She said she's leaving me again
Then she got lost
Then she got lost
She took the midnight train to nowhere
She said that she was leaving home
Yeah she's leaving me tomorrow
But tomorrow never came
For Jayne
Never came for Jayne
For Jayne
For Jayne....
