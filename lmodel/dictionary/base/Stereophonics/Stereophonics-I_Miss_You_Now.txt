<song artist="Stereophonics" title="I_Miss_You_Now">
I feel numb wanna hold you
Wanna tell you that you'll be alright
Sad news from todays call
All the pictures are all in my mind
I miss you now
Older we're getting older
Are all my old friends gonna leave me and die
Im helpless, it's gonna get us, before it gets us
I wanna kiss you goodbye
I miss you now
Feel numb wanna hold you
Wanna tell you that you'll be alright
Helpless it's gonna get us, before it gets us
I wanna kiss you goodbye
I miss you now
