<song artist="Stereophonics" title="Fight_Or_Flight">
Run run gotta hide away
Run run gotta get away
Run run gotta find a way
Run run gotta drive away
Run run find a hideway
Run run gotta get away
Today today today
Today today today
Fight or flight
(run run gotta get away)
Fight or flight
Run run got another day
Run run gonna ride away
Run run got a mind to make
Run run I'm alive today
Run run find a hideway
Run run gotta get away
Today today today
Today today today
Fight or flight
(Run run gotta get away)
Fight or flight
Fight or flight
Fight or flight
To get what you want
To get what you need
You gotta let go so you can be free
To get what you want
To get what you need
You gotta let go so you can be free
To get what you want
To get what you need
You gotta let go so you can be free
To get what you want
To get what you need
You gotta let go so you can be free
To get what you want
To get what you need
You gotta let go so you can be free
To get what you want
To get what you need
You gotta let go so you can be free
To get what you want
To get what you need
You gotta let go so you can be free
To get what you want
To get what you need
You gotta let go so you can be free
