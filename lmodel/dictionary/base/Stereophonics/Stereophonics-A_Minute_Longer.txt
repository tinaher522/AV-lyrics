<song artist="Stereophonics" title="A_Minute_Longer">
They're calling out
Come on lets go
But I'm miles away
To a year before
Laughs from a glass
Drank to the past
On the old green seat
Like velvet to the hand
Think I'd like to stay a minute longer
Would you like to stay a minute longer? 
Last one for some
Sick from the rum
I played golf on the carpet with someone
Crash back to date
Few things I hate
But I'd rather us live
In the present day
Think I'd like to stay a minute longer
Would you like to stay a minute longer? 
If you'd like I'd stay for a minute longer
As longer
As longer
Longer
(repeat to fade)
