<song artist="Stereophonics" title="We_Share_The_Same_Sun">
Calling over to seize my hunger
To see you to feel you
To be with need you
 
We hold out we hold on
I'm older colder
Here it comes light up my sky
 
Chorus:
 
Yeah we share the same sun
Everyday
Yeah we share the same sun
Everyday
 
White lights blinding
Headlights driving
To see you to feel you
To be with need you
 
We hold out we hold on
I'm older colder
Here it comes light up my sky
 
Chorus
 
When my light is out for you at home
It shines for me in early dawn
We're worlds apart but now I see
I'm in your heart whenever we are apart
And the sky shines bright
 
Within the morning sun (in the morning sunday morning sun)
Our time has just begun (time has just begun has just begun)
In the morning sun (in the morning sunday morning sun)
Our time to run will come
 
Chorus
 
When my light is out for you at home
It shines for me in early dawn
We're worlds apart but now I see
I'm in your heart whenever we are apart
And the sky shines bright
 
Yeah we share the same sun everyday
