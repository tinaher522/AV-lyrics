<song artist="Stereophonics" title="A_Thousand_Trees">
Standing at the bus stop
With my shopping in my hands
When I'm overhearing elderly ladies
As the rumours start to fly
Hear them in the school yard
In the scrap yard, in the chip shop
In the phone box, in the pool hall
At the shoe stall, every corner turned around
It started with a school girl who was running
Running home to her mam and dad
Told them she was playing
In the change room of her local football side
They said tell us again, she told them again
They said tell us the truth, they find it hard to believe
Cause he taught our Steve, he even trained me
Taught Uncle John, who's a father of three
It only takes one tree
To make a thousand matches
Only takes one match
To burn a thousand trees
You see him in the class room, in the swimming pool
Where the match stick men are made
At the Scout's hall, at the football
Where the wise we trust are paid
They all honour his name, he did a lot for the game
He got his name knocked up above the sports ground gates
Now they're ripping them down, stamping the ground
Picture gathers dust in the bar
It only takes one tree
To make a thousand matches
Only takes one match
To burn a thousand trees
Wake up and smell the rain
Shake up, he's back to stay
He hasn't been on a holiday
Growing seeds don't believe
Why he's been away, in the school yard
Change room, playing fields
Bathroom, phone box
Office blocks, corners turned around
They keep doubting the flame, tossing the blame
Got his name knocked up above the sports ground gates
Now they're ripping them down, stamping the ground
Pictures gathers dust in the bar in the lounge
It only takes one tree
To make a thousand matches
Only takes one match
To burn a thousand trees
