<song artist="Stereophonics" title="I_Wanna_Be_Your_Dog">
So messed up, I want you here
In my room, I want you here
And now we're gonna be face to face
I'll lay right down in my favorite place
And now I wanna be your dog
And now I wanna be your dog
And now I wanna be your dog
Well, come on
And now I'm ready to close my eyes
And now I'm ready to close my mind
And now I'm ready to feel your hand
And lose my heart on burning sands
And now I wanna be your dog
And now I wanna be your dog
And now I wanna be your dog
Well, come on
And now I wanna be your dog
And now I wanna be your dog
And now I wanna be your dog
Well, come on, well, come on, well, come on
