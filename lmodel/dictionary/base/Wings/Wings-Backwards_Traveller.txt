<song artist="Wings" title="Backwards_Traveller">
Hey, did you know that I'm
Always going back in time
Rhyming slang, Auld Lang Syne my dears 
Through the years
I'm the backwards traveller
Ancient wool unraveller
Sailng songs, wailing on the moon
I'm the backwards traveller
Ancient wool unraveller
Sailng songs, wailing on the moon
Wailing on the moon
And we were sailng songs, wailing on the moon
We were wailing on the moon
