<song artist="Wings" title="Venus_And_Mars_-_Rock_Show_-_Jet">
Sitting in the stand of
 the sports arena 
Waiting for the show to begin 
Red lights, green lights,
 strawberry wine, 
A good friend of mine
follows the stars
Venus and Mars
Are alright tonight 
What's that man
 holding in his hand? 
He looks a lot like a guy
 I knew way back when 
Its Silly Willy with the Philly Band 
Could be
Oooh eee
What's that man movin'
 cross the stage? 
It looks a lot like the one
 used by Jimmy Page 
Its like a relic from a different age 
Could be
Oooh eee
If there's a rock show 
At the Concertgebouw 
They've got long hair 
At the Madison Square 
You've got rock and roll 
At the Hollywood Bowl 
We'll be there
Oh yeah 
The lights go down
They're back in town, okay 
Behind the stacks
You glimpse an axe 
The tension mounts
You score an ounce, ol√© 
Temperatures rise as you see
The white of their eyes 
If there's a rock show 
At the Concertgebouw 
They've got long hair 
At the Madison Square 
You've got rock and roll 
At the Hollywood Bowl 
We'll be there
Oh yeah 
(Tell me all about it baby) 
In my green metal suit I'm preparing
To shoot up the city 
And the ring at the end of my nose
Makes me look rather pretty 
Its a pity there's nobody here
To witness the end 
Save for my dear old friend
 and confidante
Mademoiselle Kitty 
Kitty, Kitty, Kitty
Tell me
What's that man movin' to and fro? 
That decibel meter doesn't seem
To be reading low 
But they was louder at the Rainbow 
Could be
Oooh eee 
If there's a rock show 
Course I'm gonna be there 
Long hair 
At the Madison Square 
Rock and roll 
At the Hollywood Bowl 
We'll be there
Oh yeah
Well there's a rock show 
Course I'm gonna be there 
Long hair 
At the Madison Square 
Rock and roll 
At the Hollywood Bowl 
Rock show
Long hair
Rock and roll
Rock show
Long hair
Rock and roll
Rock show
Long hair
Jet! Jet! Jet!
I can almost remember
 their funny faces 
That time you told 'em that 
You were gonna be marrying soon 
And Jet, I thought the only 
Lonely place was on the moon 
Jet! Ooh
Jet! Ooh
Jet! Was your father as bold
 as a Sergeant Major? 
Well how come he told you that 
You were hardly old enough yet? 
And Jet, I thought the major 
Was a lady suffragette 
Jet! Ooh
Jet! Ooh 
Ah, Mater, want Jet to always love me 
Ah, Mater, well I want Jet
 to always love me 
Ah, Mater, much later 
Ooh she said
Ooh she said
And Jet don't you know that
I thought you was a real
 lady suffragette
Jet! Ooh
Jet! Ooh
Ah, Mater, want Jet to always love me 
Ah, Mater, want Jet to always love me 
Ah, Mater, much later
Ooh she said
Ooh she said
Jet! With the wind in your hair 
Of a thousand laces 
Climb on the back and we'll 
Go for a ride in the sky 
And Jet don't you know that
I thought you was a little
 lady suffragette
Jet! Ooh
Jet! Ooh
Yeah don't you know that
I thought you was a little
lady suffragette
A little lady
Sweet little lady, yeah yeah
Ooh
