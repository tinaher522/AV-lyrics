<song artist="Wings" title="Big_Barn_Bed">
Who's that coming round that corner 
Who's that coming round that bend 
Who's that coming round that corner, will it 
Will it be my friend 
Keep on sleeping in a big barn bed 
Keep on sleeping in a big barn bed 
Who you gonna weep on
Who you gonna sleep on
Who you gonna creep on next
Weeping on a willow 
Sleeping on a pillow 
Leaping armadillo, yes 
Keep on sleeping in a big barn bed etc. 
Will it be my friend 
Keep on sleeping in a big barn bed 
Who you gonna weep on
Who you gonna sleep on
Who's you gonna creep on next
Weeping on a willow
Sleeping on a pillow 
Leaping armadillo, yes 
Keep on sleeping in a big barn bed 
Keep on sleeping in a big barn bed etc.
