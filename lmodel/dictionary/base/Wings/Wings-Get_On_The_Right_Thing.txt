<song artist="Wings" title="Get_On_The_Right_Thing">
All at once you get love on your mind 
And your world is as kind as a penny 
Oh.... and you knew it all along, you did the right thing 
Believe me its true, and it can happen to you 
All at once you get sound in your ears 
And your cloud disappears into yellow 
Well you know they were were wrong 
Get on the right thing
Well you knew it all along 
Get on the right thing 
Believe me its so, because i happen to know 
Try a little love, you can't go wrong 
Get On the right thing,
Get on the right thing,
Get on the right thing
My little love you cant go wrong 
Get on the right thing,
Get on the right thing,
Get on the right thing 
Do, get on the right thing you 
All at once we see things in our skies 
And we both realize it together 
Well you know they were wrong 
Get on the right thing 
Yes you knew it all along 
Get on the right thing
Believe me its so 
Because i happen to know 
You can't go wrong 
Get on the right thing, 
Get on the right thing, 
Get on the right thing,
You can't go wrong get on the right thing 
Ah get on the right thing you.
And try a little love 
And it can't go wrong 
Get on the right thing you 
Try a little love, you can't go wrong 
Get on the right thing
