<song artist="Wings" title="Spirits_Of_Ancient_Egypt">
You're my baby and I love you
You can take a pound of love
And cook it in the stew
When you've finished doing that
I know what you want to do 
'Cause you're my baby and I love you
I'm your baby; do you love me?
I can drive a Cadillac
Across the Irish sea
But when I've finished doing that 
I know where I'll want to be
'Cause I'm your baby and you love me 
Spirits of ancient Egypt
Shadows of ancient Rome
Spirits of ancient Egypt 
Hung on the telly
Hung on the telly 
Hung on the telephone 
You're my baby, I know you know
You could sell an elevator
To Geronimo 
And when you've finished doing that 
I know where you'll want to go
'Cause you're my baby, I know you know 
Spirits of ancient Egypt
Echoes of sunken Spain
Spirits of ancient Egypt 
Hung on the phone
A-hung on the phone 
A-hung on the phone 
Again
