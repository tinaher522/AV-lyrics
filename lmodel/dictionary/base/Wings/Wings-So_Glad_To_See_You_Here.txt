<song artist="Wings" title="So_Glad_To_See_You_Here">
Someone's got a home tonight
Someone's got a road tonight
Someone's got a way, action will be red
You you wanna worry?
Oo, you're gonna knock 'em dead, yeah
Someone's got a show tonight
Someone's gotta go tonight
Someone's doing rhyme, someone turn your mind
Someone to lift your eyes up
Leanin' toward the light, ooh
So glad to see you here
So glad you could come, yeah
So glad to see you here
Carry on (carry on, carry on)
Carry on (carry on, carry on)
Yeah, yeah oh, we're going up tonight
Well in time to make a flight
The airplane's standing on the runway
Engine nervously waiting for something to bite, yeah, yeah
Got to roll tonight
You got to roll tonight
Some have got it bad, some have got to do it
You got it better and there's nothing to it, no no no no no
So glad to see you here
So glad you could come, yeah
So glad to see you here
Carry on (carry on, carry on)
Carry on (carry on, carry on)
Someone's got a home tonight
Someone's got a road tonight
Someone's got a way, action will be red
You you wanna worry?
Oo, you're gonna knock 'em dead
Oh no no no no no no no no, woah
We're open tonight for fun
We're open tonight for fun
We're open tonight for fun
We're open tonight for fun
We're open tonight for fun
We're open tonight for fun
We're open tonight for fun
We're open tonight for fun
We're open tonight for
