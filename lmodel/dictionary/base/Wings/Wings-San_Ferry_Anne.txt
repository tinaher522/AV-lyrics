<song artist="Wings" title="San_Ferry_Anne">
You've got a lot
And from what you've got I'd say you're doing well, dear
Dressed like a dream
And if things are what they seem, you're looking swell, dear
Your little man (your little man)
Brings you trinkets when he can but he can't stay, dear
That's very well (that's very well)
But inside your shiny shell you dance all day, dear
So go be gay (so go be gay)
Let your feelings leap away into the laughter
San Ferry Anne (San Ferry Anne)
And the world keeps turning happy ever after
