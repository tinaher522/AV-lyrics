Someone's knockin' at the door
Somebody's ringin' the bell
Someone's knockin' at the door
Somebody's ringin' the bell
Do me a favour, open the door
And let 'em in, ooh, yeah
Someone's knockin' at the door
Somebody's ringin' the bell
Someone's knockin' at the door
Somebody's ringin' the bell
Do me a favour, open the door
And let 'em in, yeah, let 'em in
Sister Suzy, Brother John
Martin Luther, Phil and Don
Brother Michael, Auntie Gin
Open the door, let 'em in
Oh, yeah
Sister Suzy, Brother John
Martin Luther, Phil and Don
Uncle Ernie, Auntie Gin
Open the door, let 'em in, oh, yeah
Someone's knockin' at the door
Somebody's ringin' the bell
Someone's knockin' at the door
Somebody's ringin' the bell
Do me a favour, open the door
And let 'em in, ooh yeah, yeah, let 'em in
Sister Suzy, Brother John
Martin Luther, Phil and Don
Uncle Ernie, Uncle Ian
Open the door, let 'em in, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Someone's knockin' at the door
Somebody's ringin' the bell
Someone's knockin' at the door
Somebody's ringin' the bell
Do me a favour, open the door
And let 'em in, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
