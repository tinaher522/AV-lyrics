<song artist="Wings" title="Nineteen_Hundred_And_Eighty-Five">
Oh, no one ever left alive
In nineteen hundred and eighty five will ever do 
She may be right, she may be fine 
She may get love but she won't get mine, 'cause I got you 
Whoa I, oh I 
Well I just can't get enough of that sweet stuff 
My little lady gets behind 
Shake it, baby don't break it
Oh my mama said the time 
would come when I would find myself in love with you 
I didn't think, I never dreamed 
That I would be around to see it all come true 
Whoa I, oh I 
Well I just can't get enough of that sweet stuff 
My little lady gets behind
Yeah!
Oh, no one ever left alive
In nineteen hundred and eighty five will ever do 
She may be right, she may be fine 
She may get love but she won't get mine, 'cause I got you 
Whoa I, oh I 
Well I just can't get enough of that sweet stuff 
My little lady's left behind 
Band on the run, band on the run, band on the run
