<song artist="Wings" title="You_Gave_Me_The_Answer">
You gave me the answer 
To love eternally. 
I love you and - you, 
You seem to like me. 
Wherever we wander 
The local folk agree, 
I love you and - you, 
You seem to like me. 
Heading back to old familiar places, 
Places where the cobwebs blow away 
I can forget the airs and graces 
Terpsichory ...
You'll never be crowned by 
The aristocracy, 
To their delight, you'd merely invite 
Them in for a cup of tea ... and 
I love you and - you 
You seem to like 
You seem to like 
You seem to like 
Me.
