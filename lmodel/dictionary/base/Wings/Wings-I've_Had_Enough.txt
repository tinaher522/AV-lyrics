<song artist="Wings" title="I've_Had_Enough">
You're talking to me from the back of my car
And I can't get nothing right
And then you wonder why I satnd at the bar 
Day and night
Well, I've had enough 
I can't put up with anymore 
No, no, no, no, no, no
I've had enough 
I can't put up with anymore 
No, no, no, no, no, no
You stand behind me witha watch in your hand 
And I can't get nothing done
Well, people tell me you're a punctual man
But come on, come on
Well, I've had enough 
I can't put up with anymore 
No, no, no, no, no, no
I've had enough 
I can't put up with anymore 
No, no, no, no, no, no 
I earn the money and you take it away
When I don't know where you're from
I should be worried but they say it'll pay
For a bomb
Well, I've had enough 
I can't put up with anymore 
No, no, no, no, no, no
I've had enough 
I can't put up with anymore 
No, no, no, no, no, no
Well, I've had enough 
I can't put up with anymore 
No, no, no, no, no, no
I've had enough 
I can't put up with anymore 
No, no, no, no, no, no
Baby, you know sometimes you get a little weary
But if it ever happens honey
You just come along to me
Because you know
I've had enough
I can't put up with anymore
No, no, no, no, no, no
I've had enough
I can't put up with anymore
No, no, no, no, no, no
Well, I've had enough 
I can't put up with anymore 
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
I've had enough 
I can't put up with anymore 
Now baby
I've had enough
