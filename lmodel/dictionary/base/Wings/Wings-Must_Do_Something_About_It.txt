<song artist="Wings" title="Must_Do_Something_About_It">
I've just seen another sunset on my own
All day long I've been alone
And I must do something about it
Yes, I must do something about it
Played another losing card game with myself
Lonely joker on the shelf
And I must do something about it
Yes, I must do something about it
No one on the party line, no one seems to need a dime
No one even knows that I'm feeling this way
No one seems to need my vote, no one has to change a note
No one here to hold my coat, oh what a day
I've just watched another movie on TV
No one's in the house but me
And I must do something about it
Yes, I must do something about it
Oh, oh, something about it
I've just dialed another number on my phone
All day long I've been alone
And I must do something about it
Yes, I must do something about it
I've just seen another sunset on my own
All day long I've been alone
And I must do something about it
Yes, I must do something about it
Must do something about it
Yes, I must do something about it
