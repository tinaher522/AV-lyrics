Girlfriend
I'm gonna tell your boyfriend, yeah
Tell him
Exactly what you're doing, yeah
Tell him what you do to me
Late at night when the wind is free
Girlfriend
Girlfriend
I'm gonna show your boyfriend, yeah
Show him
The letters I've been saving, yeah
Show him how you feel inside
Then our love couldn't be denied, oh no
And we're gonna have to tell him
You'll only be a girlfriend of mine 
Till the river stops a-flowin'
Till the wind doesn't wanna blow
Till the flowers stop a-growin'
Till my love doesn't want to know
Yes, we're gonna have to tell him
You'll only be a girlfriend of mine
Girlfriend
We'd Better Tell Your Boyfriend, yeah
Tell Him
Exactly What We're Doing, yeah
Tell him what he needs to know 
Or he may never let you go, oh no
Yes, we're gonna have to tell him
You'll only be a girlfriend of mine
Till the river stops a-flowin'
Till the wind doesn't wanna blow
Till the flowers stop a-growin'
Till the ocean's a sea of snow
Girlfriend
