<song artist="Wings" title="She's_My_Baby">
My baby, she comes out at night
She's taking me by surprise, she's my baby
Like gravy, down to the last drop
I keep mopping her up, yeah, yeah, she's my baby
She's a baby in the morning time when the sleep is in her eyes and the world is waking up
She has a rhythm, oh, believe me, I ain't lying, she's a woman
She's a lady in the evening tide, when the stars are in the skies
That's the time she changes back into a kitten, oh, believe me, I ain't lying
She's my baby, she comes out at night
She's taking me by surprise, she's my baby
Like gravy, down to the last drop
I keep mopping her up, yeah, yeah, she's my baby
Well, she's a baby in the morning time when the sleep is in her eyes and the world is waking up
She has a rhythm, oh, believe me, I ain't lying, she's a woman
She's a lady in the evening tide, when the stars are in the skies
That's the time she changes back into a kitten, oh, believe me, I ain't lying
She's my baby, she comes out at night
She's taking me by surprise, yeah, she's my baby
Like gravy, down to the last drop
I keep mopping it up, mopping it up, yeah, she's my baby
Ooh, like gravy, down to the last drop
I keep mopping it up, mopping it up, yeah, she's my baby
Ooh, like gravy, down to the last drop
I keep mopping it up, mopping it up, yeah, she's my baby
Ooh, like gravy, down to the last drop
I keep mopping it up, mopping it up, yeah, she's my baby
