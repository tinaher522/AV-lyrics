<song artist="Wings" title="Mrs_Vandebilt">
Down in the jungle living in a tent
You don't use money you don't pay rent 
You don't ever know the time 
But you don't mind 
Ho hey ho... 
When your light is on the blink 
You never think of worrying 
What's the use of worrying? 
When your bus has left the stop 
You'd better drop your hurrying 
What's the use of hurrying? 
Leave me alone Mrs Vandebilt 
I've got plenty of time of my own 
What's the use of worrying? 
What's the use of hurrying? 
What's the use of anything? 
Ho hey ho... 
What's the use of worrying? 
What's the use of hurrying? 
What's the use of anything? 
Ho hey ho... 
When your pile is one the wane 
You don't complain of robbery 
Run away don't bother me 
What's the use of worrying? 
What's the use of anything? 
Leave me alone Mrs Washington 
I've done plenty of time on my own 
What's the use of worrying? 
What's the use of hurrying? (no use!) 
What's the use of anything? 
Ho hey ho...
