<song artist="Wings" title="Wonderful_Christmastime">
The moon is right
The spirits up
We're here tonight
And that's enough
Chorus:
Simply having a wonderful christmastime
Simply having a wonderful christmastime
The party's on
The feelin's here
That only comes
This time of year
Repeat chorus
The choir of children sing their song
Ding dong, ding dong
Ding dong, ding ohhhh
Ohhhhhhh
Ohhhhhhh
Repeat chorus
The word is out
About the town
To lift a glass
Ahhh don't look down
Simply having a wonderful christmastime
The choir of children sing their song
They practiced all year long
Ding dong, ding dong
Ding dong, ding dong
Ding dong, ding dong
Ding dong, ding dong
The party's on
The spirits up
We're here tonight
And that's enough
Simply having a wonderful christmastime
We're simply having a wonderful christmastime
The moon is right
The spirits up
We're here tonight
Oh, and that's enough
Repeat chorus
Simply having a wonderful christmastime
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Christmastime
