The grand old painter died last night
His paintings on the wall
Before he went he bade us well
And said goodnight to us all
Drink to me, drink to my health
You know I can't drink any more
Drink to me, drink to my health
You know I can't drink any more
3 o'clock in the morning
I'm getting ready for bed
It came without a warning
But I'll be waiting for you baby
I'll be waiting for you there
So drink to me, drink to my health
You know I can't drink any more
Drink to me, drink to my health
You know I can't drink any more
Jet
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Jet
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Jet
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Jet
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Drink to me, drink to my health
You know I can't drink any more
Drink to me, drink to my health
You know I can't drink any more
I'll be waiting for you baby, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Drink to me, drink to my health
You know I can't drink any more
Drink to me, drink to my health
You know I can't drink any more
Ooh
Ooh
Drink to me, drink to my health
You know I, hey ho
Ho, hey ho
Ho, hey ho
Ho, hey ho
Ho, hey ho
Ho, hey ho
Ho, hey ho
