<song artist="Wings" title="Don't_Let_It_Bring_You_Down">
Though somethings in life are hard to bear
Don't let it bring you down
Should the sand of time run out on you
Don't let it bring you down
Don't go down
Don't go underground
Things seem strange
But they change, how they change
Up and down your carousel will go
So don't let it bring you down
Don't go down
Don't get out of town
Get te know how it goes
How it goes
When the price you have to pay is high
Don't let it bring you down
Don't let it bring you down
