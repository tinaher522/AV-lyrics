<song artist="Wings" title="Mamunia">
Mamunia, Mamunia, Mamunia
Oh, oh, oh
Mamunia, Mamunia oh oh oh oh
The rain comes falling from the sky
To fill the stream that fills the sea 
And that's where life began for you and me 
So the next time you see rain, it ain't bad 
Don't complain it rains for you
The next time you see L.A. rainclouds
Don't complain it rains for you and me 
Mamunia
It might have been a bright blue day 
But rainclouds had to come this way
They're watering everything that they can see
A seed is waiting in the earth
For rain to come and give him free 
So the next time you see L.A. rainclouds
Don't complain, it rains for you
So lay down your umbrellas
Strip off your plastic macs 
You've never felt the rain my friend 
Till you've felt it running down your back 
So the next time you see rain, it ain't bad 
Don't complain it rains for you
The next time you see L.A. rainclouds
Don't complain it rains for you and me 
Mamunia
