<song artist="Wings" title="Letting_Go">
Ah, she tastes like wine 
Such a human being so divine 
Oh she feels like sun 
Mother nature look at what you're done 
Oh I feel like letting go 
Oh I feel like letting go. 
Ah, she looks like snow 
I want to put her in a Broadway show 
Ah she'll dance and dine 
Like a Lucifer she'll always shine 
Oh I feel like letting go 
Oh I feel like letting go. 
Oh I feel like letting go 
Ah, she sings it so 
I want to put her on the radio 
One day and there you are 
Ladies and gentleman - 
A brand new star. 
Oh I feel like letting go 
Oh I feel like letting go.
