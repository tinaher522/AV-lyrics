<song artist="Wings" title="Bluebird">
Late at night when the wind is still
I'll come flying through your door
And you'll know what love is for
I'm a bluebird 
(I'm a bluebird, I'm a bluebird, I'm a bluebird)
Yeah yeah yeah
(I'm a bluebird, I'm a bluebird, I'm a bluebird)
Yeah yeah yeah
Touch your lips with a magic kiss
And you'll a be bluebird too
And you'll know what love can do
I'm a bluebird 
(I'm a bluebird, I'm a bluebird, I'm a bluebird)
Yeah yeah yeah
(I'm a bluebird, I'm a bluebird, I'm a bluebird)
Yeah yeah yeah
Bluebird (bluebird), uh huh
Bluebird (bluebird), uh huh
Bluebird (bluebird)
Fly away through the midnight air
As we head across the sea
And at last we will be free
You're a bluebird
(You're a bluebird, you're a bluebird, you're a bluebird)
Yeah yeah yeah
(You're a bluebird, you're a bluebird, you're a bluebird)
Yeah yeah yeah
 
Bluebird (bluebird), uh huh
Bluebird (bluebird), uh huh
Bluebird (bluebird)
(At last we will be free)
(Bluebirds you and me)
(At last we will be free)
Bluebird (bluebird), uh huh
Bluebird (bluebird), uh huh
Bluebird (bluebird)
All alone on a desert island
We're living in the trees
And we're flying in the breeze
We're the bluebirds 
(We're the bluebirds, we're the bluebirds, we're the bluebirds)
Singing bluebird (bluebird), uh huh
Bluebird (bluebird), uh huh
Bluebird (bluebird, bluebird)
