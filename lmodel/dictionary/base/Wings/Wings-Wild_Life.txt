<song artist="Wings" title="Wild_Life">
The word "wild" applies to the words "you" and "me" 
While taking a walk through an African park one day
I saw a sign say, "The animals have the right of way"
Wild life, whatever happened to
Wild life, the animals in the zoo
We're breathing so hard
A lot of political nonsense in the air
You're making it hard 
For the people who live in there
You're moving so fast
But, baby, you know not where
Wild life, (wild life) what's gonna happen to 
Wild life, (wild life) the animals in the zoo
You'd better stop
There's animals everywhere
And man is the top, an animal too
And, man, you just got to care
Wild life, (wild life) what's gonna happen to 
Wild life, (wild life) the animals in the zoo
You're breathing a lot 
Of polical nonsense in the air
You're making it hard 
For the people who live in there
Wild life, (wild life) what's gonna happen to 
(What ever happened to, what ever happened to) 
Wild life, (wild life), the animals in the zoo
(What ever happened to, what ever happened to) 
Wild life, what ever happened to? 
What ever happened to?
