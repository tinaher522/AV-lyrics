<song artist="Wings" title="Cook_Of_The_House">
All you rocking hep cats, come on!
Ground rice, sugar, vinegar, seco salt, macaroni too
Cook of the house, I'm the cook of the house
No matter where I serve my guests, they seem to like the kitchen best
'Cause I'm the cook of the house, cook of the house
The salad's in the bowl, the rice is on the stove
Green beans in the colander and where the rest is, heaven only knows
Cinnamon, garlic, salt, pepper, cornbread, curry powder, coffee too
Cook of the house, I'm the cook of the house
No matter where I serve my guests, they seem to like the kitchen best
'Cause I'm the cook of the house, cook of the house
And where the rest is, heaven only knows
Cinnamon, garlic, salt, pepper, cornbread, curry powder, coffee too
Cook of the house (I'm the cook of the house)
I'm the cook of the house (she's the cook of the house)
No matter where I serve my guests, they seem to like the kitchen best
'Cause I'm the cook of the house (she's the cook of the house)
Cook of the house (I'm the cook of the house)
I'm the cook of the house
Take it, fellas
