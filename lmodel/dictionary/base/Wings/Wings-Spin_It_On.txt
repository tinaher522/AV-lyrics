<song artist="Wings" title="Spin_It_On">
(This is it)
Spin it on, don't stop
Take it back to the top
'Cause I've got another lot of love for you
I wanna spin it on, spin it on
Off to the flicks with the piddle in her nicks to the fair with her hair in curlers
Their cousins didn't get all down to the pleasure dome
Their cousins didn't spend their night in an aircraft hangar
Memories...
Spin it on, don't stop
Take it back to the top
'Cause I've got another lot of love for you
That's why I wanna spin it on, spin it on, spin it on
Spin it on!
Spin it on, don't stop
Take it back to the top
'Cause I've got another lot of love for you
That's why I wanna spin it on, spin it on
We're off to the fields with a missionary's zeal for the life of the wife of the farmer
Their cousins didn't get all down to the billiard hall
Their cousins didn't spend their time on a pinball table
Memories...
Spin it on, don't stop
Take it back to the top
That's why I wanna spin it on, spin it on
'Cause I've got another lot of love for you
Spin it on! spin it on!
I wanna spin it on! I wanna spin it on!
Spin it on, don't stop
Take it back to the top
'Cause I've gotta whole lotta love for you
