Jet
Jet
I can almost remember their funny faces
That time you told them that you were going to be marrying soon
And Jet, I thought the only lonely place was on the moon
Jet, ooh
Jet, ooh
Jet
Was your father as bold as a sergeant major?
Well, how come he told you that you were hardly old enough yet?
And Jet, I thought the major was a lady suffragette
Jet, ooh
Jet, ooh
Ah, mater, want Jet to always love me
Ah, mater, want Jet to always love me
Ah, mater, much later
Jet
And Jet, I thought the major was a lady suffragette
Jet, ooh
Jet, ooh
Ah, mater, want Jet to always love me
Ah, mater, want Jet to always love me
Ah, mater, much later
(Woo she say)
Yeah we'll do what we want
(She say, what she say)
Brrrrr, woo!
Jet
With the wind in your hair of a thousand laces
Climb on the back and we'll go for a ride in the sky
And Jet, I thought that the major was a lady suffragette
Jet, ooh
Jet, ooh
And Jet, you know I thought you was a lady suffragette
Jet, ooh
Hey little lady
My little lady, yes, ooh
