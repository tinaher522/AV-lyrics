<song artist="Wings" title="Getting_Closer">
Say you don't love him, My Salamander
Why do you need him?
Oh no, don't answer, oh no
I'm getting closer
I'm getting closer to your heart
Keeping ahead of the rain on the road
Watching my windscreen wipers (wipers)
Radio play me a danceable ode
Cattle beware of snipers (snipers)
When will you see me, My Salamander?
Now don't try to tell me
Oh no, don't answer, oh no
I'm getting closer
I'm getting closer to your heart
Hitting the chisel and making a joint
Glueing my fingers together ('gether)
Radio play me a song with a point
Sailor, beware of weather (weather)
Woah, woah, I'm getting closer, My Salamander.
Well, when will we be there?
Oh no, don't answer, oh no
I'm getting closer
I'm getting closer to your heart
I'm getting closer to your heart
I'm getting closer to your heart
I'm getting closer
Closer, closer
Closer, closer, closer, closer
