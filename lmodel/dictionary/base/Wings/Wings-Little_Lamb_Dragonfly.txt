<song artist="Wings" title="Little_Lamb_Dragonfly">
I have no answer for you little lamb
I can help you out 
But I cannot help you in
Sometimes you think that life is hard
And this is only one of them
My heart is breaking for you little lamb
I can help you out 
But we may never meet again
La la la la la la la 
La la la la la la la
Dragonfly, fly by my window 
You and I still have a way to go
Don't know why you hang around my door
I dont live here any more 
Since you've gone I never know
I go on, but I miss you so
Dragonfly, don't keep me waiting
(I'm waiting, can't you see me, I'm waiting)
When we try we'll have a way to go
Dragonfly, you've been away too long
How did two rights make a wrong?
Since you've gone I never know, I go on
But I miss you so 
In my heart I feel the pain 
Keeps coming back again
Dragonfly, fly by my window
(I'm flying, can't you see me, I'm flying)
You and I can find a way to see
Dragonfly, the years ahead will show
How little we really know
Since you've gone it's never right
They go on, the lonely nights
Come on home and make it right 
My heart is aching for you little lamb
I can help you out 
But I cannot help you in
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la...
