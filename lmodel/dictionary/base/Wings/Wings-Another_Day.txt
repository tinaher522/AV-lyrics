<song artist="Wings" title="Another_Day">
Every day she takes a morning bath, she wets her hair
Wraps a towel around her
As she's heading for the bedroom chair
It's just another day
Slipping into stockings
Stepping into shoes
Dipping in the pocket of her raincoat
Ah, it's just another day
At the office where the papers grow she takes a break
Drinks another coffee
And she finds it hard to stay awake
It's just another day
Du du du du du
It's just another day
Du du du du du
Lt's just another day
Ay, so sad, so sad
Sometimes she feels so sad
Alone in her apartment she'd dwell
Till the man of her dreams comes to break the spell
Ah, stay, don't stand around
And he comes and he stays
But he leaves the next day, so sad
Sometimes she feels so sad
As she posts another letter to the sound of five
People gather 'round her
And she finds it hard to stay alive
It's just another day
Du du du du du
It's just another day
Du du du du du
It's just another day
Ay, so sad, so sad
Sometimes she feels so sad
Alone in her apartment she'd dwell
Till the man of her dreams comes to break the spell
Ah, stay, don't stand around
And he comes and he stays
But he leaves the next day, so sad
Sometimes she feels so sad
Every day she takes a morning bath, she wets her hair
Wraps a towel around her
As she's heading for the bedroom chair
It's just another day
Slipping into stockings
Stepping into shoes
Dipping in the pockets of her raincoat
Ah, it's just another day
Du du du du du
It's just another day
Du du du du du
It's just another day
