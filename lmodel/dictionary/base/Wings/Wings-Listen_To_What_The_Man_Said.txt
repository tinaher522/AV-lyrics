<song artist="Wings" title="Listen_To_What_The_Man_Said">
Any time, any day
You can hear the people say
That love is blind
Well, I don't know, but I say love is kind
Do do do, do do do do
Do do do, do do do do
Soldier boy kisses girl
Leaves behind a tragic world
But he won't mind
He's in love, and he says love is fine
Do do do, do do do do
Do do do, do do do do
Oh, yes, indeed we know
That people will find a way to go
No matter what the man said
And love is fine, for all we know
For all we know, our love will grow
That's what the man said
So won't you listen to what the man said?
He said
Oh, take it away
Oh, yes, indeed we know
That people will find a way to go
No matter what the man said
And love is fine, for all we know
For all we know, our love will grow
That's what the man said
So won't you listen to what the man said?
He said
Oh, yes, indeed we know
That people will find a way to go
No matter what the man said
And love is fine, for all we know
For all we know, our love will grow
That's what the man said
So won't you listen to what the man said?
He said
The wonder of it all, baby
The wonder of it all, baby
The wonder of it all, baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh
