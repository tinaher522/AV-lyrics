<song artist="Wings" title="Lady_Madonna">
Lady Madonna
Children at your feet
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet
Who finds the money
When you pay the rent?
Did you think that money was heaven-sent?
Friday night arrives without a suitcase
Sunday morning creeping like a nun
Monday's child has learned to tie his bootlace
See how they run
Lady Madonna
Baby at your breast
Wonders how you manage to feed the rest
(Ba-ba-ba-baaa ba-ba ba-ba-baaa
Ba-ba-ba-baaa ba-ba baaa ba-baa ba-baa
Wa-ba-ba-baaa ba-ba ba-ba-baaa)
See how they run
Lady Madonna
Lying on the bed
Listen to the music playing in your head
Tuesday afternoon is never ending (ba-ba-ba-baaa)
(Ba-ba ba-ba-baaa)
Wednesday morning papers didn't come (ba-ba-ba-baaa)
(Ba-ba baaa ba-baa ba-baa)
Thursday night your stockings needed mending (ba-ba-ba-baaa)
(Ba-ba ba-ba-baaa)
See how they run
Lady Madonna
Children at your feet
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet.
