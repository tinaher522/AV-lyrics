<song artist="Wings" title="After_The_Ball-Million_Miles">
After the ball, after the ball
You were the one out in the hall
You were the one, the one who would love me, after the ball
After the ball, after the ball
You were the one out in the hall
You were the one, the one who would love me, after the ball
Well, I arrived, looked around, but the room was full of strangers
Nowhere was a friendly face to be found
Later on, I awoke, but the party, it was over
There you were waiting to bring me 'round
After the ball, after the ball
You were the one out in the hall
You were the one, the one who would love me, after the ball
After the ball, after the ball
You were the one out in the hall
You were the one, the one who would love me, after the ball
How many million miles, day-oh?
How many million miles, day-oh?
When I get up, up, up in the morning, whoa! Lord I know
When I look up, up, up in the evening, whoa! Lord I know
How many million miles, day-oh?
How many million miles, day-oh?
How many million miles, day-oh?
