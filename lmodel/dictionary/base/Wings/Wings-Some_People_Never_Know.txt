<song artist="Wings" title="Some_People_Never_Know">
No one else will ever see 
How much faith you have in me
Only fools would disagree that it's so:
Some people never know.
Like a fool, I'm far away 
Ev'ry night, I hope and pray 
I'll be coming home to stay and it's so: 
Some people never know. 
Some people can't sleep at nighttime, 
Believing that love is a lie. 
I'm only a person like you, Love, 
And who in the world can be right all the right times? 
I know I was wrong, make me right, right. 
Only love can stand the test 
Only you'll outshine the rest 
Only fools take second best, and it's so:
Some people never know.
