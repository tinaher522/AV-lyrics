<song artist="Wings" title="Again_And_Again_And_Again">
Now you don't wanna be the little woman
Now you don't want to be the little woman
I love, no, no, no, no. I love
Now you don't wanna stay in my school
You don't wanna be the one that's cool
You don't wanna be the little woman I love
You're up all night
And we can let it hang out right, yeah
I said good-bye to all my expectations
The day you walked out of my life
Winter time is coming now
Gimme a sign if you can somehow
Make it clear where you're heading for
Will I see you someday at my door?
Taking it all into consideration
Love's a game I never win.
I've been in very similar situations
Again and again and again
Oh no, now you don't wanna be the little woman
No, you don't want to be the little woman
I love, I love
Now you don't wanna stay in my home
You just wanna be on your own
And you don't wanna be the little woman I love
Take it away
All right
Ah, yeah!
Well things were fine all the summer long
Then things changed, so where did we go wrong?
We can run but we cannot hide
In greener grass on the other side
Taking it all into consideraton
Love's a game I never win
I've been in very similar situations
Again and again and again
Again and again and again
Again and again and again
Again and again and again
Again and again and again
And again and again and again
Again and again and again (and again)
Again and again and again (and again)
Again and again and again (and again)
Again and again and again (and again)
