<song artist="Wings" title="Let_Me_Roll_It">
You gave me something
I understand
You gave me loving in the palm of my hand
I can't tell you how I feel
My heart is like a wheel
Let me roll it
Let me roll it to you
Let me roll it
Let me roll it to you
I want to tell you
And now's the time
I want to tell you that you're going to be mine
I can't tell you how I feel
My heart is like a wheel
Let me roll it
Let me roll it to you
Let me roll it
Let me roll it to you
I can't tell you how I feel
My heart is like a wheel
Let me roll it
Let me roll it to you
Let me roll it
Let me roll it to you
You gave me something
I understand
You gave me loving in the palm of my hand 
I can't tell you how I feel 
My heart is like a wheel 
Let me roll it
Let me roll it to you
Let me roll it
Let me roll it to you
