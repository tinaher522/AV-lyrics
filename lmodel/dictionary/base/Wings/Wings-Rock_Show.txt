What's that man holding in his hand? 
He looks a lot like a guy I knew way back when 
It's Silly Willy with Philly Band 
Could be . . . . . Oo-Ee . . . . . . 
What's that man movin' cross the stage? 
It looks a lot like the one used by Jimmy Page 
Its like a relic from a different age 
Could be . . . . . Oo-Ee . . . . . . 
If there's rock show 
At the Concertgebow 
They're got long hair 
At the Madison Square 
You've got rock and roll 
At the Hollywood Bowl, 
We'll be there . . . . . . Oo Yeah . . . . . . . 
The lights go down - they're back in town O.K. 
Behind the stacks you glimpse an axe 
The tension mounts you score an ounce ole! 
Temperatures rise as you see the white of their eyes 
If there's rock show 
At the Concertgebow 
They're got long hair 
At the Madison Square 
You've got rock and roll 
At the Hollywood Bowl, 
We'll be there . . . . . . Oo Yeah . . . . . . .  
In my green metal suit I'm preparing to shoot up the city 
And the ring at the end of my nose makes me look rather pretty 
It's a pity there's nobody here to witness the end 
Save for my dear old friend and confidante - madamoiselle Kitty 
What's that man movin' to and fro? 
That decibel meter doesn't seem to be reading low. 
But they was louder at the rainbow 
Could be . . . . . Oo-Ee . . . . . . 
If there's rock show 
At the Concertgebow 
They're got long hair 
At the Madison Square 
You've got rock and roll 
At the Hollywood Bowl, 
We'll be there . . . . . . Oo Yeah . . . . . . . 
If there's rock show . . . . . . . 
If there's rock show . . . . . . . 
If there's rock show . . . . . . .
