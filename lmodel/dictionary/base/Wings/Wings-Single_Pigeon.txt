<song artist="Wings" title="Single_Pigeon">
Single pigeon through the railing,
did she throw you out?
Sunday morning fight about Saturday night.
Single seagull gliding over
Regent's Park canal,
do you need a pal for a minute or two, you do?
Me too (me too, me too)
I'm a lot like you.
Me too (me too, me too)
I'm a lot like you.
Did she turf you out in the cold morning rain again?
Me too (me too, me too)
I'm a lot like you.
Me too (me too, me too)
I'm a lot like you.
Sunday morning fight about Saturday night.
