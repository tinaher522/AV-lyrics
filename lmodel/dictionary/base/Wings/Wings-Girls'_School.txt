<song artist="Wings" title="Girls'_School">
Sleepy head, kid sister
Lying on the floor
18 years and younger, boy
Well, she knows what she's waiting for
Yuki's a cool school mistress
She's an oriental princess
She shows films in the classroom, boy
They put the paper on her windows
(Ah) What can the sisters do?
(Ah) Girls' school
Well, head nurse is Sister Scala
Now she's a Spanish doll
She runs a full body out call massage parlour
From the teacher's hall
(Ah) What can the sisters do?
(Ah) Girls' school
Well now, Roxanne's the woman trainer
She puts the kids to bed, yeah
She gives them pills in a paper cup
And she knocks 'em on the head
(Ah) What can the sister do?
(Ah) Girls' school 
(Ah) What can the sister do?
(Ah) Girls' school, ohh yeah yeah
She shows films in the classroom, boy
They put the paper on her windows, yeah ooh
(Ah) What can the sister do?
(Ah) Girls' school
(Ah) What can the sister do? Oh yeah, yeah
(Ah) Girls' school
