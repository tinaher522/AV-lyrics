<song artist="Wings" title="Arrow_Through_Me">
Ooh, baby, you couldn't have done a worse thing to me
If you'da taken an arrow and run it right through me, ooh
Ooh baby, a bird in the hand is worth two flyin'
But when it came to love, I'd knew you'd be lyin'
It could have been a finer thing
Would have been a major attraction
With no other thing
Offering a note of distraction
Come on, get up, get under way and bring your love
Ooh baby, you wouldn't have found a more down hero
If you'da started at nothing and counted to zero
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Ooh baby, you couldn't have done a worse thing to me
If you'da taken an arrow and run it right through me
It could have been a finer thing
Flying in a righter direction
With no other thing
Featuring my love and affection
Come on, get up, get under way and bring your love
Ooh baby, you wouldn't have found a more down hero
If you'da started at nothing and counted the zero
