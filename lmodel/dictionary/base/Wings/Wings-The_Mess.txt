<song artist="Wings" title="The_Mess">
You sailed away one night in june 
I heard you say you would be back soon 
But since that day it's been on long loon 
Oh - sweet darling the mess I'm in 
I spoke to jimmy with the big tattoo 
Said had he seen any sign of you 
He looked at me and then laughed at you 
See just wait a minute, oh darling what a mess I'm in 
When I want ya do I get ya 
All I needed your number, 
Will you give me your number 
Oh sweet darling 
Oh sweet darling 
Oh - sweet darling what a mess I'm in 
What a mess I'm in, since you left me 
What a mess I'm in, oh yeah 
Oh oh - oh oh wo - wo 
Oh oh - oh wo,wo wo 
When you're near me 
Can you hear me 
I can't see ya 
I can feel ya 
When you're near me 
Can ya hear me
