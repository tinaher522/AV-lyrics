<song artist="Wings" title="Call_Me_Back_Again">
Well when I, when I was
Just a little baby boy
Every night I would call
Your number brought me joy
I called your house every night since then 
But I ain't never, no, no, never
Heard you calling me
(Call me back again)
Come on and call me back again
(Call me back again)
Come on and call me back again
Ooh, I heard your name every night since then
But I ain't never, no, no, never
Heard you calling me
(Call me back again)
Come on and call me back again
(Call me back again)
Yeah, call me back again
Well when I, when I was
Just a little baby boy
Every night, every night I would call
Because your number brought me joy
Ooh, I've called your name
Every night since then
But I ain't never, no, no, no, no, no, never
Heard you calling me
(Call me back again)
Come on and call me back again
(Call me back again)
Come on and call me back again
(Call me back again)
Come on and, come on and call me back again
(Call me back again)
Ooh babe, call me back again
(Call me back again)
Wooh, why won't you call me, call me back again
(Call me back again)
I ain't never heard you, so why won't you call me back again
(Call me back again)
