<song artist="Wings" title="Venus_And_Mars_(Reprise)">
Standing in the hall 
Of the great cathedral 
Waiting for the transport to come 
Starship 21zna9 
A good friend of mine 
Studies the stars 
Venus and Mars 
Are alright tonight. 
Come away on a strange vacation 
Holiday hardly begun 
Run into a good friend of mine 
Sold me her sign
Reach for the stars 
Venus and Mars 
Are alright tonight
