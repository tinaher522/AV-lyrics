<song artist="Miley_Cyrus" title="Free">
FREE!!!
LOl!!!
Yeah I'm out on my own
I turned off my phone
No contact with the outside world
I'm in my own little place
(Pre Chorus)
I'm racing time inside my mind
Now the clocks ticking
My heart is beating
Chorus
Faster Faster Now
I'm all alone all to myself
Slower Slower
I want this to last
Now I want to go fast
Feel the wind thourgh my hair cause I don't care
No more feeling defeated
A break that I needed
Some time to myself 
Nobody Else
No No
It feels so good 
To be free
Just me only me
No boy toy
No cell phone
I'm in my zone
Cause
(Pre Chorus)
I'm racing time inside my mind
Now the clocks ticking
My heart is beating
Chorus
Faster Faster Now
I'm all alone all to myself
Slower Slower
I want this to last
Now I want to go fast
Feel the wind thourgh my hair cause I don't care
Yeah yeah I don't have a care
No No I'm free no no only me
