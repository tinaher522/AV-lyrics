<song artist="Miley_Cyrus" title="Twist_And_Turn">
I close my eyes,
I fall asleep and forget about recent cries
I dream about my mom, 
I dream about my super star life,
Then it hits me
I have had bad things in my life
I have a wife,
I got stabbed with a knife
So I twist and turn
And turned and twist
And burned and kissed
My life is a roller coaster
So I twist and turn in bad
OH OH
Thump Thump Thump
Hump Hump Hump
I just noticed there is a boy in my bed
Oh yah I love my life
Never a time to twist and turn
