<song artist="Miley_Cyrus" title="Dooo_It!">
Yeah I smoke pot, yeah I love peace
But I don't give a fuck, I ain't no hippie
Yeah I smoke pot, (do it) yeah I love peace (do it)
But I don't give a fuck (do it), I ain't no hippie
Yeah I smoke pot, yeah I love peace
But I don't give a fuck, I ain't no hippie
Yeah I smoke pot, (do it) yeah I love peace (do it)
But I don't give a fuck, I ain't no hippie (do it)
(I understand) feel like I am one with the universe
(I understand) and all I need is right here
(I understand) feel like I am part of the universe
And it's part of me
(I understand) why there is a sun?
And how do birds fly?
And why there is a moon
Way up in the skies?
Why there is trees (do it)
And what the fuck is love? (do it)
And what is flying saucers
Watching from above?
Yo
Fuck, man
Feel like I am one with the universe
And all I need is right here
Feel like I am part of the universe
And it's part of me
Yo, sing about love, love is what you need
Loving what you sing, and loving smoking weed
(Weed, weed, weed, weed)
Sing about peace, being high and free
So if you don't give a fuck, sing along with me
Yeah I smoke pot, yeah I love peace
But I don't give a fuck, I ain't no hippie
(I understand) why there is a sky?
And why are bitches bored?
And why are motherfuckers
Putting bullets in their guns
Violence is king
But peace is the way
Someday weâ€™re gonna see it
So here's what I'm saying
Peace muthafuckers (do it)
Peace muthafuckers (do it)
Peace muthafuckers (do it)
Peace muthafuckers (do it)
Peace muthafuckers (do it)
Peace muthafuckers (do it)
Peace muthafuckers (do it)
So peace muthafuckers (do it)
Why do they put the dick in the pussy?
Fuck you
