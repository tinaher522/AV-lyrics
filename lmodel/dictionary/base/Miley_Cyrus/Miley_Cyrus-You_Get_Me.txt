<song artist="Miley_Cyrus" title="You_Get_Me">
As I
I walkin' down the street
I notice a sweater with my name on it
Oh, oh it's so cheap
Then you come walkin' 
And show me the real price
And I always know when your hair is filled with lice
Because we see everything in eachother
Isn't it funny...how I'm with your other brother
You get me
And you tell me
Why do I
I get you all the time 
And you get me all the time
yeah
You get me
As we
We walkin' up and down the street (going in circles)
But as I talk to you I just stare at my feet
Why can't I
Look you straight in the eye 
And tell you how I feel
You get me
And you tell me
Why do I
I get you all the time
And you get me all the time
Yeah
You get me
I 
Wish we could talk about our feelings
But all of a sudden
My thoughts are unreeling
These feelings are unreeling
I can't believe I told you
Now why not tell me yours
'cause' 
You get me
And you tell me
Why do I
I get you all the time
And you get me all the time
Yeah
You get me
And you tell me
Why do I
I get you all the time
And you get me all the time
Yeah
You get me
You get me
You get me
You
You get
You get me
