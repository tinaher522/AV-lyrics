<song artist="Miley_Cyrus" title="Perfect_Everyday">
I know you think I'm perfect
I know you think I'm fine
But that's not the real side of me
everytime
You think I'm the one for you
You think that I love you
But that is not true
Now this what I got to say to you
It's not perfect everyday
I try all the time to make it right
It's not the time to talk about this
It's not perfect everyday
I always make mistakes
and that's who I am
It's not perfect everyday
I know you think pretty
I know you think I'm cool
But sometimes I just like to take
a dip in the pool
You think I'm the one for you
You think that I love you
But that is not true
This is what I got to say to you

It's not so perfect everyday
I try all the time to make it right
It's not the time to talk about this
It's not perfect everyday
I always make mistakes
and that's who I am
It's not perfect everyday
(Bridge)
Nobody's perfect and I know it
It's something you should see
It's not perfect everyday
You know that theres destiny inside of you
Know this is what I gotta say to you
(Slowly and Softly)
It's not perfect everyday and I don't have to try
To make it all fall into place
It's not so perfect everyday 
It's not so perfect everyday
It's not so perfect everyday
(perfect everyday)
It's not so perfect everyday!
yea
