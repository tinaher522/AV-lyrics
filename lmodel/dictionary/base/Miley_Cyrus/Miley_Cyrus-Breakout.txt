<song artist="Miley_Cyrus" title="Breakout">
Every week's the same
Stuck in school, so lame
My parents say that I'm lazy
Getting up at 8 am's crazy
Tired being told what to do
So unfair
So uncool
Day's too long
And I'm holding on
Till I hear the bell ring
Cuz it's the time when we're gonna, the time when
We're gonna breakout,
Let the party start,
We're gonna stay out,
Gonna break some hearts,
We're gonna dance till the dance floor falls apart,
Uh-Oh! all over again,
We're gonna wake up,
Everyone we know ,
We're gonna have some fun,
Gonna lose control,
Feels so good, to let go-oh-oh

Hangin' out is just something we like to do
With my friends and the mess we get into,
These are the lessons that we choose
Not a book full of things we'll never use
The day's too long
And I'm holding on
Till I hear the bell ring
Cuz it's the time when, the time when
We're gonna breakout,
Let the party start,
We're gonna stay out,
Gonna break some hearts,
We're gonna dance till the dance floor falls apart,
Uh-Oh! all over again,
We're gonna wake up,
Everyone we know,
We're gonna have some fun,
We're gonna lose control,
It feels so good, to let go-oh-oh

I wish it would never end
Spendin' time with my friends
Oh, with my friends
We're gonna breakout,
Let the party start,
We're gonna stay out,
Gonna break some hearts,
We're gonna dance till the dance floor falls apart,
Uh-Oh! all over again,
We're gonna wake up,
Everyone we know,
We're gonna have some fun,
We're gonna lose control,
It feels so good, to let go
We're gonna breakout,
Let the party start,
We're gonna stay out,
Gonna break some hearts,
We're gonna dance till the dance floor falls apart,
Uh-Oh! all over again,
We're gonna wake up,
Everyone we know,
We're gonna have some fun,
We're gonna lose control,
It feels so good, to let go
