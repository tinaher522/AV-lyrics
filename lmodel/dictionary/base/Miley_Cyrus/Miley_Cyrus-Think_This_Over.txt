<song artist="Miley_Cyrus" title="Think_This_Over">
I think of you all the time..
I think it must be a sign
We were meant for each other
If I didnt know better you could be my brother.
I just wish I could think straight
and wouldnt be late for everything
I really blame you

Im sorry your stuck cause I cant stop think about all this muck.
I guess its just luck that we found each other
I wish I could stay
but I need another day
to think this all out
and be up and about
