<song artist="Miley_Cyrus" title="Rooting_For_My_Baby">
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
When you wake in the morning and I can tell it's not your best side
No good morning today
I stay to the right if I know you're mad
You're on the left side, stay out of your way
Just hold on
In a minute it'll be over and gone
Gone gone gone gone
I know, I know that you go through a lot
I know, I know that the pressure makes you high
See I know, I know, 'cause you still know what you got
I know, I know yeah
Ooh, ooh
I'm rooting for my baby
Ooh, ooh, yeah
If you were here
I'd get you a beer and I would hang your clothes
You wanna behold
So you roll up your sleeves and you sweat and breathe
This is a long road, so much more to go
Just hold on
In a minute it'll be over and gone
Gone gone gone gone
I know, I know that you go through a lot
I know, I know that the pressure makes you high
See I know, I know, 'cause you still know what you got
I know, I know yeah
Ooh, ooh
I'm rooting for my baby
Ooh, ooh, yeah
See, I've been dream-catching
I thought that this is everlasting
Life boy with you means love and laughter
Happily ever after
So hold on
In a minute, it'll be over and gone
Gone, gone, gone, gone
I know, I know that you go through a lot
I know, I know that the pressure makes you high
See I know, I know, 'cause you still know what you got
I know, I know yeah
Ooh, ooh
I'm rooting for my baby
Ooh, ooh, yeah
I'm rooting for you, baby
Yeah
I'm rooting for my baby
Yeah
But you go through a lot
The pressure makes you high
You still know what you got
Yeah
