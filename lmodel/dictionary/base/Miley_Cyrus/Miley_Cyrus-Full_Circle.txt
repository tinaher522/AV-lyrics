<song artist="Miley_Cyrus" title="Full_Circle">
I've been in a rut
Back and forth enough
Heart like a wheel
Without you around
So uncomfortable
Is how it feels
Every time you're near
Trouble disappears
Under the ground
But when you go too far
Silver clouds'll start
Hanging around
And I know why
Tried to run-but I keep on
Coming back
Full circle and I
Can't jump the track
Can't let you go whoa
Tied to one
So I keep on
Coming back
Full circle
‘Cause I know you'll come around
You'll come around
Skippin' down a broken path
How long can I last
Please let me know
Where's the finish line
‘Cause I've got to find
Somewhere to go
I don't wanna hear
These people interfere
What do they know
What I feel inside
When I'm up all night
Needing you home
I don't know why
Tried to run-but I keep on
Coming back
Full circle and I
Can't jump the track
Can't let you go whoa
Tied to one
So I keep on
Coming back
Full circle
‘Cause I know you'll come around
You'll come around
'Cause I know you'll come around
You'll come around
I'll keep on running til we meet in the middle
I'll put pride aside and I'll give just a little
There's miles to go but we both know
That we'll make it
And I know why
Tried to run-but I keep on
Coming back
Full circle and I
Can't jump the track
Can't let you go whoa
Tied to one
So I keep on
Coming back
Full circle
‘Cause I know you'll come around
You'll come around
Yeah, I know you'll come around
You'll come around
Yeah, I know you'll come around
You'll come around
