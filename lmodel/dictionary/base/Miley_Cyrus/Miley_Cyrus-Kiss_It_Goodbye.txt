<song artist="Miley_Cyrus" title="Kiss_It_Goodbye">
What'cha waiting for an opportunity to knock
Come on outside your door
You're crazy if ya leave it locked
You know you gotta let it in
And fin'ly I know it, too
The question's what it's always been
So what are you gonna do?
Blow - another chance?
No - I understand!
Yo! if you're comin', hello!
kiss it goodbye!
Your fear is holdin’ you back!
Kiss it goodbye! 
Your little panic attack 
Kiss it goodbye! 
I – I did it! 
And – it O-M-G! 
I’m – a different girl!
Kiss it goodbye-ye-ye! 
Kiss it goodbye-ye-ye!
You procrastinate
The world is gonna pass you by
Already running late
Instead o’ running, better fly
You crash into the ground, and hard
Ya pick yourself up and laugh
Ya keep on shootin’ for the stars
What other choice do you have?
Blow – another chance?
No – I understand!
Yo! If you’re comin’, hello!
kiss it goodbye!
Your fear is holdin’ you back!
Kiss it goodbye! 
Your little panic attack 
Kiss it goodbye! 
I – I did it! 
And – it O-M-G! 
I’m – a different girl!
Kiss it goodbye-ye-ye! 
Kiss it goodbye-ye-ye!
Kiss it goodbye-ye-ye! 
Kiss it goodbye-ye-ye!
Kiss, kiss – kiss it all goodbye! Bye!
Kiss, kiss – kiss it all goodbye! Bye!
Kiss, kiss – kiss it all goodbye! Bye!
Kiss, kiss – kiss it all goodbye!
Yeah, yeah
Kiss it all goodbye bye
Yeah
kiss it goodbye!
Your fear is holdin’ you back!
Kiss it goodbye! 
Your little panic attack 
Kiss it goodbye! 
I – I did it! 
And – it O-M-G! 
I’m – a different girl!
Kiss it goodbye-ye-ye! 
Kiss it goodbye-ye-ye!
Kiss it goodbye-ye-ye! 
Kiss it goodbye-ye-ye!
