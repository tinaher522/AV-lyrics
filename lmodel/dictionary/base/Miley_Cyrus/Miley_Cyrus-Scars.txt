<song artist="Miley_Cyrus" title="Scars">
I can pretend that I don't see you,
I can pretend I don't wanna hold you when you're around,
(When you're around)
I can say that nothing was right,
But we know if I looked in your eyes I'd break down,
(Yeah, let's break down)
If I could, for just one night, to be with you, to make it right,
And what we were, and what we are,
Is hidden on the, in the scars,
If I could, take you there,
I wont let go, this I swear,
You wont have to wonder what we are,
Cause you wont have to look to far,
It's in the scars, It's hidden in the scars,
If I told you that I love you,
But I'm doing alright without you it'd be a lie, But I could try,
I'd run 1000 miles we're leaving,
You're the only one, I want you breathing to break down,
(Yeah, let's break down!)
If I could, for just one night, to be with you, to make it right,
And what we were, and what we are,
Is hidden on the, in the scars,
If I could, take you there,
I wont let go, this I swear,
You wont have to wonder what we are,
Cause you wont have to look to far,
It's in the scars, ooh
Yeah I'll tell you all my secrets,
All the ones I've kept inside,
And Ill give you all the reasons,
That you faded from my life,
I will learn to go, baby come here for, I will let you, up away!!
If I could, for just one night, to be with you, to make it right,
And what we were, and what we are,
Is hidden on the, in the scars,
If I could, take you there,
I wont let go, baby this I swear,
You wont have to wonder what we are,
Cause you wont have to look to far,
It's in the scars, It's hidden in the scars, Hidden in the scars!
Yeah-yeah-eh-eh-eh-yeah-eh
I can pretend that I don't see you,
I can pretend I don't wanna hold you when you'r around
