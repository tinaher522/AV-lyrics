<song artist="Miley_Cyrus" title="All_Around_The_World_Tonight">
(Noah)
All Around The world tonight
A Heavenly Is Glowing 
And People everywhere are touched By Light
All Around The world tonight
(Chorus Noah)
So shine little star
Reaching near and far
Setting Hearts a glow
With your radiant Light 
And when they hear your song 
Let them sing along 
All Around The world tonight  
(Miley)
All Around The world tonight
A song of Peace Is Flowing 
If Only for a moment Hearts will unite 
All Around The world tonight 
(Chorus Both)
All Around The world tonight (3x)
