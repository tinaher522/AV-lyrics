<song artist="Miley_Cyrus" title="Far_Away">
Sometimes I wish I could be...
Sometimes I wish I just wasnt me..
Sometimes I wish that I...
that I could touch the sky
that I wouldn't shy again 
that I could fly away....
fly away
fly away
fly away
So many hard times I went through
Wouldnt have em if it werent fo you
I just need to fly away

and come back another day
The good times are over
Now around here its all sober..
Ive been waiting for a change
But now stuck in these kind of days
Sometimes I wish I could fly away..
fly away
fly away
fly away
Give me a break
I made just one little mistake
I know have a heartache
