<song artist="Miley_Cyrus" title="How_Do_You_Do">
i see you comb your hair 
you give me that grin 
its making me spin now spinning within 
before i melt like snow 
i say hello 
how do you do(how do you do)

how do you do what you do 
the things that you do 
knowone i know could ever keep up with you
how do you what you do 
did it ever make sence to you 
to say bye bye bye
