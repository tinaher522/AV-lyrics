<song artist="Miley_Cyrus" title="Nobody's_Perfect">
Everybody makes mistakes
Everyone has those days
One, two, three, four!
Everybody makes mistakes
Everybody has those days (Aw yeah!)
Everybody knows what, what I'm talking about
Everybody gets that way (That's right)
Everybody makes mistakes (Uh-huh!)
Everybody has those days 
Everybody knows what, what I'm talking about
Everybody gets that way 
Yeah!
Sometimes I'm in a jam
I gotta make a plan
It might be crazy
I do it anyway
No way to know for sure
I figure out a cure
I'm patching up the holes
But then it overflows
If I'm not doin' too well
Why be so hard on myself?
(Whoo!)
Nobody's perfect
I gotta work it
Again and again 'til I get it right
Nobody's perfect
You live and you learn it
And if I messed it up sometimes (Hey)
Nobody's perfect
Sometimes I work a scheme
But then it flips on me
Doesn't turn out how I planned
Gets stuck in quicksand
The problem can be solved
Once I get involved
I try to be delicate
Then crash right into it
But my intentions are good (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Sometimes just misunderstood
Nobody's perfect
I gotta work it (Work it!)
Again and again 'til I get it right (That's right!)
Nobody's perfect (Whoo!)
You live and you learn it
And if I messed it up sometimes
Nobody's perfect
I gotta work it (Come on)
I know in time I'll find a way (Oh)
Nobody's perfect
Sometimes I fix things up
And they fall apart again 
(Nobody's perfect)
I know I mix things up
But I always get it right in the end
You know I do
Next time you feel like
It's just one of those days
When you just can't seem to win
When things don't turn out the way you planned
Figure something else out
Don't stay down, try again!
Yeah!
Everybody makes mistakes
Everybody has those days (That's right)
Everybody knows what, what I'm talking about
Everybody gets that way (Whoo!)
Everybody makes mistakes (Here we go)
Everybody has those days (Uh-huh)
Everybody knows what, what I'm talking about
Everybody gets that way
Nobody's perfect
I gotta work it (Work it!)
Again and again 'til I get it right (Whoo!)
Nobody's perfect
You live and you learn it
And if I messed it up sometimes
Nobody's perfect
I gotta work it
I know in time I'll find a way
Nobody's perfect
You live and you learn it
Cause everybody makes mistakes (Oh!)
Nobody's perfect
No, no
Nobody's perfect
