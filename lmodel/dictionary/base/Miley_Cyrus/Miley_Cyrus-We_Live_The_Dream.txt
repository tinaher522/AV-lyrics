<song artist="Miley_Cyrus" title="We_Live_The_Dream">
We live the dream
The dream that our fathers lived
A dream of peace and harmony
We Live The Dream
We live the dream the dream 
That our mothers lived
When we're all sad
We Live The Dream
When there's fear inside 
And hope is fading away
We have faith and hopefullness 
We Live The Dream
Do-Na No-Bis Delana Pac-em
Do-Na No-Bis Pac-em
We live the dream
The dream that the babies cried
You gotta let it out
We Live The Dream
WE LIVE THE DREAM! x3
