<song artist="Miley_Cyrus" title="Attached">
I am Attached
More than that is true
I am attached and hopelessly in love with you.
Attached is something I don't normally do
But when I am around you, 
It's more than what I can help to do.

I am Attached
More than that is true
I am attached
No doubt about it,
I am glued.
