<song artist="Miley_Cyrus" title="The_Fairytale_Ending">
2 years ago I thought I had it all
1 boy and 1 girl is all it took
Fell in love at a young age
And now 2 moms are best friends
Now what can the boy and girl do
And they think ...
We got to move on
We need to just be friends
Do I hate you
Do I love you
Or do I just need to let go
But we still have to get along
And now the fairytale is ending
The boy is very taken
He loves her
And she loves him back
The girl is single
And happy as can be
But the question is did they move on
And they think
We got to move on
We need to just be friends
Do I hate you
Do I love you
Or do I just need to let go
But we still have to get along
And now the fairytale is ending
The next night the turn to each other
And they spill out their feeling
He said I still have feelings for you
She said but we need to move on and just be friends
I know
We got to move on
We need to just be friends
Do I hate you
Do I love you
Or do I just need to let go
But we still have to get along
And now the fairytale is ending
And now the fairytale is ending
