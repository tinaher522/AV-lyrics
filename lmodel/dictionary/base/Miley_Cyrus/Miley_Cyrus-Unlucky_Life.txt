<song artist="Miley_Cyrus" title="Unlucky_Life">
Sometimes you leave the best for last
But it happen'd before when it past
You put your life apon your dreams
But you don't even know what it means
CHORUS: I have an unlucky life Like I have to strive
Into...
A place that's new...
I have an unlucky life 
So I have to strive..........
Sometimes it snows in the Philippines
All the sickness could be seen 
Live somewhere else
And then your life despairs
When you don't know what's happening
CHORUS
CHORUS
You know when I...
Go in someone's life
Leave it to me
And everyone will see 
What is life to me
CHORUS
CHORUS
