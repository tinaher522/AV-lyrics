<song artist="Miley_Cyrus" title="It's_All_Right_Here">
Why would you rather be
Anywhere else with me?
I tell you man, it's all right here
(wherever we are, wherever we are)
Check out the scenery
We won the lottery
I tell you man, it's all right here
And I can't believe you'd even think
Of being any place
Any place but right here
The grass may be greener in the end
I swear
But you'll be wishing your here if you were there
Wherever we go
(Wherever we are, wherever we are, wherever we are, wherever we are.)
It's all right here
Excuse me, officer
If you're smart
You know you wanna be
In the mix of white hot energy
Its all to welcome you
Times so good it's moving way to fast
If we could I know we'd make it last
It's all here for you
It's all here for you
It's all here for you
It's all right here
(Wherever we are, wherever we are, wherever we are, wherever we are.)
It's all right here (it's all right here)
It's all right here (Wherever we are, wherever we are)
Come on (Wherever we are, wherever we are)
Come on, let's go
It's all right here
Any open road (any open road)
Will take us anywhere
And as long as I'm with you
I won't care where
And we can choose
The desert or the sea
Cause the good times are in front of you and me
Why would you rather be anywhere else with me?
I tell you man it's all right here (Wherever we are, wherever we are)
Check out the scenery
We won the lottery
I tell you man it's all right here
And I can't believe you'd even think
Of being any place
Any place but right here
The grass may be greener in the end I swear
But you'll be wishing you were here if you were there
You'd wish you were here
You'd wish you were here
And if I could make you wanna stay
Just one more day
Maybe everything
Would be okay
Come on
A come on
A come on
It's all right here
(Wherever we are, wherever we are, wherever we are, wherever we are.)
It's all right here
It's all right here
(Wherever we are, wherever we are, wherever we are, wherever we are.)
Yeah!
