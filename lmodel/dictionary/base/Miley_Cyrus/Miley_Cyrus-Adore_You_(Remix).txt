<song artist="Miley_Cyrus" title="Adore_You_(Remix)">
Baby, baby yeah, are you listening?
When you say you love me 
Know I love you more 
And when you say you need me 
Know I need you more 
Boy, I adore you, I adore you
[Beat Break]
Boy, I adore you, I adore you 
Baby, can you hear me? 
When I'm crying out for you 
I'm scared oh, so scared 
But when you're near me 
I feel like I'm standing with an army 
Of men armed with weapons, hey, oh 
When you say you love me 
Know I love you more 
And when you say you need me 
Know I need you more 
Boy, I adore you, I adore you 
[Beat Break]
When you say you love me 
Know I love you more 
And when you say you need me 
Know I need you more 
Boy, I adore you, I adore you
