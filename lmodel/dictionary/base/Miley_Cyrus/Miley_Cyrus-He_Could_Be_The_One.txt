<song artist="Miley_Cyrus" title="He_Could_Be_The_One">
Smooth talkin', so rockin
He's got everything that a girl's wantin
Guitar cutie, he plays it groovy
And I can't keep myself
From doing somethin' stupid
Think I'm really falling for his smile
Get butterflies when he says my name
He's got something special
He's got something special
And when he's looking at me
I wanna get all sentimental
He's got something special
He's got something special
I can hardly breathe
Something's telling me, telling me
Maybe he could be the one
He could be the one
He could be the one
He could be the one
He could be the one
He could be the one
He's lightnin' sparks are flyin'
Everywhere I go he's always on my mind and
I'm going crazy about him lately
And I can't help myself
From how my heart is racin'
Think I'm really diggin' on his vibe
He really blows me away
He's got something special
He's got something special
And when he's looking at me
I wanna get all sentimental
He's got something special
He's got something special
I can hardly breathe
Something's telling me, telling me
Maybe he could be the one
He could be the one
He could be the one
He could be the one
He could be the one
He could be the one
And he's got a way of making me feel
Like everything I do is
Perfectly fine
The stars are aligned
When I'm with him
And I'm so into him
He's got something special
He's got something special
And when he's looking at me
I wanna get all sentimental
He's got something special
He's got something special
I can hardly breathe
Something's telling me, telling me
Maybe he could be the one
He could be the one
He could be the one
He could be the one
He could be the one
He could be the one
(He could be the one)
