<song artist="Miley_Cyrus" title="Real_Friends">
I thought we were friends
I must have been wrong
We were best friends for much to long
I don't wish you were here
I wish you were gone
That you'd go away and move along
I know you said sorry
You know what you did was wrong
But you did it anyway

And you can't take back the damage you've done
I thought I could trust you
But now I have to find someone else to talk to
Get some friends you'll like and trust
Because this one didn't turn out so great
I can't believe you did that to me
You wouldn't like it if someone did it to you, you'll see baby
