<song artist="Miley_Cyrus" title="Ice_Cream_Freeze_(Let's_Chill)">
Everybody do your dance
Ain't nothing better than an all night jam
Are you ready for a little something new tonight
I got a brand new step that you're gonna like
Cmon boys
Gotta do like I do,
Just follow my lead
Everybody let's chill
Do the ice cream freeze
Strike your pose
Can you do the milk shake
Shake it, Shake it down low
Do the snow cone slide
Left to right
Put your hands in the air 
We can party all night
Do the ice cream freeze
Strike your pose
Can you do the milk shake
Shake it, Shake it down low
Do the snow cone slide
Left to right
Put your hands in the air 
We can party all night
Shake it, Shake it, Shake it, Shake it
Shake it, Shake it down low
And do the ice cream freeze
All kinda steppin' make ya feel good
Triple step, butterfly, sugar foot
But I'm coming with a new thing, what ya need
Now everybody wanna do the ice cream freeze
Cmon boys
Gotta do like I do
Just follow my lead
Everybody let's chill
Do the ice cream freeze
Strike your pose
Can you do the milk shake
Shake it, Shake it down low
Do the snow cone slide
Left to right
Put your hands in the air 
We can party all night
Did I hear someone say party
Weâ€™re just getting started
Wanna take it from the top
well you know I will
Now everybody let's chill
Lights, camera, freeze
Everybody let's go
Do the ice cream freeze
Strike your pose
Can you do the milk shake
Shake it, Shake it down low
Do the snow cone slide
Left to right
Put your hands in the air 
We can party all night
Do the ice cream freeze
do the ice cream freeze
Then ya do the milk shake
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it
Do the snow cone slide
do the snow cone slide
Put your hands in the air
and we can party all night
Everybody let's chill!
