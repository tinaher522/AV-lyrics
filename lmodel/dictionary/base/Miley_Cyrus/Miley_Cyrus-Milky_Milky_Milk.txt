<song artist="Miley_Cyrus" title="Milky_Milky_Milk">
The milky, milky, milk
The milky, milky, milk
The milky, milky, milk
The milky, milky, milk
The purple that is collapsing
Head for the hills and prepare your intellect to flow
The game of life is changing
Man is about to awake
Electric sun beams dancing in a liquid in my skull
The milky, milky, milk
Your tongue milking me so hard
And from sucking on your nipples
Licking milky, milky stars
I feel like A slab of butter
That is melting in the sun
The presence melts away
Now that you and me are one
Little [?] and the greatest truth [?]
That hoping up the [?] of the last 2 billion years
I ask myself a question
What the fuck is gone
But I knew that I knew it
From the milky, milky gods
The milky, milky, milk
Your lips get me so wet
While I'm singing all the verses from the Tibetan Book of the Dead
The milky, milky, milk
The milky, milky, milk
Yeah, I'm digging it
It's time to look [?]
Yeah, I'm digging it
It's time to look [?]
Yeah, I'm digging it
Yeah, I'm digging it
I feel like [?]
Yeah, I'm digging it
That is melting in the sun
Yeah, I'm digging it
The [?]
Yeah, I'm digging it
Now that you and me are one
Yeah, I'm digging it
Now that you and me are one
Yeah, I'm digging it
Now that you and me are one
Yeah, I'm digging it
Yeah, I'm digging it
Yeah, I'm digging it
Yeah, yeah
