<song artist="Miley_Cyrus" title="I've_Noticed">
i noticed you, standin' there beside the door
i noticed you, were lookin' for more of m-e
i stood watching you freak out
i noticed, i noticed,i noticed you
i noticed that you noticed m-e
And now, guess what
it's time for you to spill your guts
Tell me all about your self
tell me what turns you on 
tell me your favorite song 
wo-oh wo-oh hey aha oh ya

(repeat music)
I noticed,
you noticed me
and this is what i-i can see
we noticed eachother
we picked eachother out from the crowd
oh ya uh ha
now tell me one more thing
do you like me?
