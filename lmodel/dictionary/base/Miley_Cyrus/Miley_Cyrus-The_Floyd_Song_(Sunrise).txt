<song artist="Miley_Cyrus" title="The_Floyd_Song_(Sunrise)">
The sunrise insists on gladness
But how can I be glad now my flower is dead
Oh, son, I see you happy
You made the morning dew
Now you're showing me the truth
I don't want to believe you
The night has the power
To hold all your helplessness in
Heaven
The darkness is sadness
Hold to each other till tomorrow
The sunrise insists on gladness
But how can I be glad now my flower is dead
Oh, son, I see you happy
You made the morning dew
Now you're showing me the truth
I don't want to believe you
Death, take me with you
I don't wanna live without my flower
Tomorrow, tomorrow
The time that it takes for love to effect a person
So deep, so deep
So deep
Oh son, oh son
Oh son, oh son
Oh son, oh son
I see you happy
Oh son, oh son
