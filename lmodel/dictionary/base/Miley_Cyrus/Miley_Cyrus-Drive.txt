<song artist="Miley_Cyrus" title="Drive">
Drive my heart into the night
You could drop the keys off in the morning
'Cause I don't want to leave home
Without your love
Without it
You told me that you wanted this
I told you it was all yours
If you're done with it
Then what'd you say forever for
If forever is out the door
I'll ignore when you call
Drive my heart into the night
You could drop the keys off in the morning
'Cause I don't want to leave home
Without your love
Without it
You told me you were coming back, right back
You promised it was real and I believe that
But if I fall for it again, I would be a fool
If our love is at the end, then why do I still want you
But I guess I got no valentine
Send me roses, I just let 'em die
I was crazy thinking you were mine
It was all just a lie
Drive my heart into the night
You could drop the keys off in the morning
'Cause I don't want to leave home
Without your love
Without it
I always knew I never wanted this
I never thought it could happen
You acted like you wanted this,
But then you let me off
I thought you would be there when I go
You promised you would be there when I go
But all the broken promises I won't miss
I'm finished, all I know are the facts
When I look you in the eyes, all I see are the lies
Been there done that
Drive my heart into the night
You could drop the keys off in the morning
'Cause I don't want to leave home
Without your love
Without it
