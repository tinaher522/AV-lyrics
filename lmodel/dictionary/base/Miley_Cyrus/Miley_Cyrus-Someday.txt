<song artist="Miley_Cyrus" title="Someday">
No boy, don't call me feisty
I worked to hard for this
No boy, no boy can find me easy to resist
But you boy, you boy
I know somewhere you exsist
Yeah i'm gonna find you
Someday, someday
I ain't gonna find you in London or Rome
Ain't gonna find you stayin' at home
Ain't gonna find you on the dance floor
Ain't gonna find you there for sure
I'm gonna find you if I  keep living
Someday (Someday, Someday, Someday, Someday)
Hey world, are you listening
I got so much to say
I know it's a small world, small world
But sometimes I can't find my way
And I know, I know
It could happen any day
Just round the corner,
I'm gonna find you
Someday, someday
I ain't gonna find you in London or Rome
Ain't gonna find you stayin' at home
Ain't gonna find you on the dance floor
Ain't gonna find you there for sure
I'm gonna find you if I  keep living
Someday (Someday, Someday, Someday, Someday)
Oh, i'm gonna find you
I'm gonna find you
I ain't gonna find you in London or Rome
Ain't gonna find you stayin' at home
Ain't gonna find you on the dance floor
Ain't gonna find you there for sure
I'm gonna find you if I  keep living
Someday (Someday, Someday, Someday, Someday)
