<song artist="Miley_Cyrus" title="Mixed_Up">
How come everything turn's out
Leaving me with more doubts
I feel like I'm upside down
And I don't wanna be here
I go right, should have gone left
And I say things I should have not said
Look at me in this big mess
I don't wanna be here
Everything I do 
Is making me more confused.
Ohh, it used to be easy 
All I had to be was me 
Now I'm mixed up
Everywhere I go
Is somewhere that I don't know
Ohh, I hope that I'm dreaming cause I'm sick of this feeling 
I'm mixed up
Somebody help me
(la, la, la, la, la)
Tell me how to fix this
I'd trade my world for one wish
To go back to my other life
Ohh, and get it right
Everything I do 
Is making me more confused
Ohh, It used to be easy 
All I had to be was me
Now I'm mixed up
Everywhere I go is 
Somewhere that I don't know.
Ohh, I hope that I'm dreaming 
Cause I'm sick of this feeling 
I'm mixed up 
Can somebody help me
To hold me 
Tell me 
Everything is gonna 
Be okay 
Cause today it feels like 
I won't make it through the darkness
Don't know how to get out of this
I'm so mixed up
Somebody help me
(La, la, la)
Everything I do 
Is making me more confused
Ohh, it used to be easy 
All I had to be was me
I'm mixed up
Everywhere I go 
Is somewhere that I don't know.
Ohh, I hope that I'm dreaming cause I'm sick of this feeling 
I'm mixed up 
Somebody help me
Somebody help me.
