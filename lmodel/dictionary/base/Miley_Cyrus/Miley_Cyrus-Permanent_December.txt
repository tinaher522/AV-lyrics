<song artist="Miley_Cyrus" title="Permanent_December">
I've been to London
Been to Paris
Australia and Rome
There's sexy boys in every city
But they're not what I want
Some got money
Some got fame
Some got cars
And the clothes
But if it just ain't you
Then I don't want to know
'Cause baby now I realize that I was wrong
When I said I didn't need you, so
Miss you bad so now I'm coming home
So you better leave the light on
Wait for me and just leave the light on, hey
This feels like a permanent December
So much colder than I can remember
When I get you back
This time I swear that I won't
Won't ever let you go
Won't let you go, no
Won't let you go, go, go, go,
Won't let you go, no
Go, go, go, go, no, no, no, no
I've been to New York
And to L.A
And to Baton Rouge
I met a boy in every city
No one kept me amused
But don't call me a Lolita
'Cause I don't let them through
'Cause I'm saving all my loving
For someone and it's you
'Cause baby now I realize that I was wrong
When I said I didn't need you, so
Miss you bad so now I'm coming home
So you better leave the light on
Wait for me and just leave the light on, hey
This feels like a permanent December
So much colder than I can remember
When I get you back
This time I swear that I won't
Won't ever let you go
Won't let you go, no
Won't let you go, go, go, go,
Won't let you go, no
Go, go, go, go, no, no, no, no
Won't let you go, go, go, go
Won't let you go, no
Go, go, go, go, no, no, no, no
Hey
What do you say?
'Cause I been all around the world
And they just aint the same
Hey
What do you say?
Without my baby
I go crazy
And I just got to scream
But now I realize that I was wrong
When I said I didn't need you, so
Miss you bad so now I'm coming home
So you better leave the light on
Wait for me and just leave the light on, oh oh!
This feels like a permanent December
So much colder than I can remember
When I get you back
This time I swear that I won't
Won't ever let you go
Won't let you go, no
Won't let you
This feels like a permanent December
So much colder than I can remember
When I get you back
This time I swear that I won't
Won't ever let you go
Won't let you go, no
Won't let you go, go, go, go
Won't let you go, no
Go, go, go, go, no, no, no, no
Won't let you go, go, go, go
Won't let you go, no
Go, go, go, go, no, no, no, no
