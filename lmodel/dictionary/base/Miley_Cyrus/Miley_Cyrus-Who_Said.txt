<song artist="Miley_Cyrus" title="Who_Said">
I'm more than just
Your average girl
I'd like to turn me up
And show the world
Aw yeah
'Cause some can talk the talk
This girl just wants to rock
I'm individual
I'm not like anyone
I can be glamorous
Just like you see in all the magazines
I can be cool as ice
Or anything I want to be
Who said, who said 
I can't be Superman?
I say, I say 
That I know I can
Who said, who said 
I won't be President?
I say, I say 
You ain't seen nothin' yet
Oh yeah
Yeah
Go on and make some noise
Every girl has a choice
To lead their own parade
I do it my way
Ow!
I can be soft and sweet
Or louder than the radio (radio)
I can be sophisticated
Or totally go (totally go)
Out of control
Who said, who said 
I can't be Superman?
I say, I say 
That I know I can
Who said, who said 
I'm not electrifying?
I say, I say
There's no holdin' back
Stayin' right on track
'Cause you control the game
So let them know your name
No limitations
On imagination
Imagining
Yeah
Who said, who said 
I can't be worldwide?
I say, I say 
Time is on my side
Who said, who said
I can't be ten feet tall?
I say, I say 
That I can have it all
Who said, who said 
I can't be Superman?
I say, I say 
That I know I can
Who said, who said 
I won't be President?
I say, I say 
You ain't seen nothin' yet
You ain't seen nothin' yet
Whoa
Yeah!
Who said?
Come on
Yeah
That's right!
