<song artist="Miley_Cyrus" title="Are_You_Ready">
Put on your coolest dress 
And your hottest pair of shoes 
Come on let's go 
Oh 
(Let's go)
Get in my car 
Turn the radio on up high 
I said high 
(Oh)
At the red light 
Boys trying to get the digits 
But we sneak by 
(By-by-by-by-by)
Ah by by 
(By-by-by-by-by)
'Cause we're heading to the club 
Nothing's gonna stop us now 
Let's go

I'm coming up with all my girls 
We're gonna party 
Like there's never a worry 'cause
Good times rules 
So no curfew 
We're showing all the moves 
The day is so cool 
Let your hair down 
Tonight you get to be a superstar 
Your living like a superstar 
A-a-ah
So we're flirting with the dude 
At the door till he says we're okay 
Hey 
Move the velvet rope 
Back off 
Get out of our way 
(He-he-he-hey)
Hey 
Come on 
Come on
All the guys got there eyes on us 
As we're moving up to the floor 
(Up to the flo-o-or)
Oh 
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Trying to waste some time 
But we're doing what we came here for 
(We're here to dance baby)
Oh
