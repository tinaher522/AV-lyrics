<song artist="Miley_Cyrus" title="Sing_Along">
Hey,yeah come on!
You can be part of adventure allaround
No one knows who is famous as people admiring you out
Best friends and friends playing, chatting is enough 
And i know i am more than them 
But less than giving upppppp.
Lift up your hands,up,up and turn around 
Don't waste time and sing along___________!
I wanna be like you as i am nothing in front of you
Show your talent,visit,shout now
Don't waste time sing along-(2)
Acting,singing is my passion 
Seeing and working is yours
As now i am free
Like bird,chicks lonely scrolling down
Lift up your hands,up,up and turn around
Don't waste time sing along________________!
I wanna be like you as i am nothing infront of you
Show your talent,visit,shout now
Don't waste time sing along,sing along,sing along
Lift up your hands,up,up and turn around
Don't waste time and sing along
Now iam just like you as standing ahead of you
Show you talent visit,shout now
Don't waste your time sing along.
And go on,and go on
And go          onnnnnnnn!
Oh yeaaaa!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
