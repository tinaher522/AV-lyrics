<song artist="Miley_Cyrus" title="Every_Part_Of_Me">
Ohhh
I feel like I'm a million miles away
From myself 
More and more these days
I've been down so many open roads
But they never lead me home
And now I just don't know
Who I really am
How it's gonna be
Is there something that I can't see
I wanna understand
Maybe I will never be
Who I was before
Maybe I don't even know her anymore
Or maybe who I am today
Ain't so far from yesterday
Can I find a way to be 
Every part of me
So I'll try, try to slow things down
And find myself, get my feet back on the ground
It'll take time but I know I'll be alright
Cause nothing much has changed on the inside
It's hard to figure out
How it's gonna be
Cause I don't really know now
I wanna understand
Maybe I will never be
Who I was before
Maybe I don't even know her anymore
Or maybe who I am today
Ain't so far from yesterday
Can I find a way to be 
Every part of me
I don't wanna wait too long
To find out where I'm meant to belong
I've always wanted to be where I am today
But I never thought I'd feel this way
Maybe I will never be
Who I was before
Maybe I don't even know her anymore
Or maybe who I am today
Ain't so far from yesterday
Can I find a way to be 
Every part of me
Every part of me.
