<song artist="Miley_Cyrus" title="Worried">
Today is not tomorrow
tomorrow is not today
And i'm worried about the reasons
to not have a good time
It's not gonna stop my nerve racking heart.
Now that i heard you talking
things have fell apart 
Maybe they did.
Oh, yes they did
The worry inside keeps along time away from your sorrow heart
Tears in your eyes somethin ain't
right
Don't you here the words i speak
It's gonna be alright
now take chance im Worried.
They said things are falling into place but their really not.

I said i'm not awaiting for my simple broken heart
To be in replaced
I painted a smile on my face
The worry inside keeps along time
away from your sorrow heart
Tears in your eyes somethin ain't right
Don't you here the words i speak
It's gonna be alright
take a chance i'm worried
Just take this darn pain away i wanna be protected
leave me bee
i'm worried 
oh worried
(yeah,yeah)
worried
