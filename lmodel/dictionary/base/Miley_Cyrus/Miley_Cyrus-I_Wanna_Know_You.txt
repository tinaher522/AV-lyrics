<song artist="Miley_Cyrus" title="I_Wanna_Know_You">
When I saw you over there  
I didn't mean to stare
But my mind was everywhere 
I wanna know you
Gonna guess that you're kind  
To say whats your mind
But you listen when I have something to show you
There's a mark above your eye  
You got it in July
Fighting for your sister's reputation
You remember people's names  
And Valentine's are lame
So I bring you flowers just for no occasion
Woah
Woah, Woah
Woah, Woah
I wanna know you
Woah, Woah, Woah, Woah
I wanna go there where you go
I wanna find out what you know
And maybe someday down the road
I'll sit back and say to myself
Yeah, I thought so
You smile and never shout  
You stand out in a crowd
You make the best of every situation
Correct if I'm wrong  
You're fragile and you're strong
A beautiful and perfect combination
Yeah
Woah, Woah
Yeah, Woah
Woah
I wanna know you 
Woah, Woah 
Woah, Woah
I wanna go there where you go
I wanna find out what you know
And maybe someday down the road
I'll sit back and say to myself
I like how you are with me
In our future history
And maybe someday down the road
I'll sit back and say to myself
Yeah, I thought so
I thought so
Woah
Yeah,
Yeah, Yeah
Yeah 
I wanna know you
Yeah 
Yeah
I wanna go there where you go
I wanna find out what you know
And maybe someday down the road
I'll sit back and say to myself
I like how you are with me
In our future history
And maybe someday down the road
I'll sit back and say to myself
Yeah, I thought so
