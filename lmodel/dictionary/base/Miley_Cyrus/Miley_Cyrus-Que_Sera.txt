<song artist="Miley_Cyrus" title="Que_Sera">
Whatever will be, will be
Delete me from your friends 
I don’t care what you think 
Let’s forget we ever met 
Don'tcha worry 'bout me
So sick to my stomach when I think about 
 the wasted time we spent together
Planning on forever, oh whatever 
Cheat me once shame on you – Cheat me twice shame on me
I’m an idiot that I couldn’t see what’s underneath that beautiful face – Thought these were my worst days 
But surprise, surprise i’m doing just fine
Ahhhh, Que Sera, Sera 
Ahhhh, Que sera, sera 
Whatever comes, I’ll be okay
Whatever life throws my way 
You wish I’d hurt, but I’m free as a bird 
And I’m happier now
Ahhhh, Que Sera
I could never go back to a thing that didn’t last
And I’m sorry to say that you’re living in the past 
If you’d ever believe I would take you back 
It took you long to get in but now you’re out so fast 
The way you played your cards –
 Should have told me who you are 
Always going all in and then you hated when I’d win 
This time you went too far 
I should have known from the start 
That you’d gamble with my heart
Ahhhh, Que Sera, Sera 
Ahhhh, Que sera, sera 
Whatever comes, I’ll be okay
Whatever life throws my way 
You wish I’d hurt, but I’m free as a bird 
And I’m happier now
Uuh – I feel it in the air 
Uuh – there’s something better out there 
Uuh – hello to the new me 
Uuh – so, goodbye baby 
Goodbye
I could never go back to a thing that didn’t last
And I’m sorry to say that you’re living in the past 
If you’d ever believe I would take you back 
It took you long to get in but now 
 you’re out so fast 
The way you played your cards
Should have told me who you are 
Always going all in and then 
 you hated when I’d win 
This time you went too far 
I should have known from the start 
That you’d gamble with my heart
Ahhhh, Que Sera, Sera 
Ahhhh, Que sera, sera 
Whatever comes, I’ll be okay
Whatever life throws my way 
You wish I’d hurt, but I’m free as a bird 
And I’m happier now
Ahhhh, Que Sera, Sera 
Ahhhh, Que sera
