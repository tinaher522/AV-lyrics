<song artist="Miley_Cyrus" title="Bottom_Of_The_Ocean">
It's been in the past for awhile
I get a flash and I smile
Am I crazy?
Still miss you baby
It was real, It was right
But I burned to hot to survive
All that's left is
all these ashes
Where does the love go?
I don't know
When it's all said and done
How could I be losing you forever?
After all the time we spent together?
I had to know why, I
had to lose you
Now you'll just become
Like everything I'll never find, again
At the Bottom of the ocean
Dododo dodododo
dododo dododo
dododo dododo
In a dream you appear
for awhile you were here
So I keep sleeping
just to keep you with me
I draw a map,connect the dots
with all the memories that i got
what I'm missing
I'll keep reliving
Where does the love go?
I don't know
When it's all said and done
How could I be losing you forever?
After all the time we spent together?
I had to know why, I
had to lose you
Now you'll just become
Like everything I'll never find, again
At the Bottom of the ocean
This is it
let go
Breathe
You don't have to love me for me
oh baby ever understand
Just know I love the time that we both had
and I don't ever wanna se you sad
be happy
I don't wanna hold you
if you don't wanna tell me you love me babe
just know I'm gonna have to walk away
I'll be big enough for both of us to say
be happy
Dododo dodododo
be happy
Dododo dodododo
be happy
