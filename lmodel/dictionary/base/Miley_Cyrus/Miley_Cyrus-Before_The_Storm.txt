<song artist="Miley_Cyrus" title="Before_The_Storm">
Yeah
Woah
Miley:
I know this isn't what I wanted
I never thought it'd come this far
Just thinkin' back to where we started
And how we lost all that we are.
Nick:
We were young and times were easy
But I could see it's not the same
I'm standing here but you don't see me
I'd give it all for that to change
And I don't want to lose her
Don't wanna let her go
Miley:
I'm standing out in the rain
I need to know if it's over
Cause I will leave you alone
Nick:
Flooded with all this pain
Knowing that I'll never hold her
Both:
Like I did before the storm (yeah)
Before the storm
Nick:
With every strike of lightning
Miley:
Comes a memory that lasts
Both:
And not a word is left unspoken
As the thunder starts to crash
Miley:
Maybe I should give up.
Miley:
I'm standing out in the rain
I need to know if it's over
Cause I will leave you alone
Nick:
Flooded with all this pain
Knowing that I'll never hold her
Like I did before the storm
Miley:
Trying to keep the lights from going out
Both:
And the clouds from ripping out my broken heart
We always say,
A heart is not a whole
Without the one who gets you through the storm
Standin' out in the rain
Knowing that it's really over
Please don't leave me alone.
I'm flooded with all this pain,
Knowing that I'll never hold you
Like I did before the storm
Yeah
Like I did before,
The storm.
