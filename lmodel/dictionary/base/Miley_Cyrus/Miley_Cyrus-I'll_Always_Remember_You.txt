<song artist="Miley_Cyrus" title="I'll_Always_Remember_You">
I always knew this day would come 
We'd be standing one by one 
With the future in our hands 
So many dreams so many plans 
Always knew after all these years 
There'd be laughter there'd be tears 
But never thought I'd walk away 
With so much joy but so much pain 
And it's so hard to say goodbye 
But yesterday's gone 
We gotta keep moving on 
I'm so thankful for the moments 
So glad I got to know ya 
The times that we had 
I'll keep like a photograph 
And hold you in my heart forever 
I'll always remember you 
La la la la
La la la la
La la la la la
Another chapter in the book 
Can't go back but you can look 
And there we are on every page 
Memories I'll always save 
Up ahead only open doors 
Who knows what we're heading towards 
I wish you love I wish you luck 
For you the world just opens up 
But it's so hard to say goodbye 
Yesterday's gone 
We gotta keep moving on 
I'm so thankful for the moments 
So glad I got to know ya 
The times that we had 
I'll keep like a photograph 
And hold you in my heart forever 
I'll always remember you 
Every day that we had 
All the good all the bad 
I'll keep'em here inside 
All the times we shared 
Every place everywhere 
You touched my life 
Yeah one day we'll look back 
We'll smile and we'll laugh 
But right now we just cry 
'Cause it's so hard to say goodbye 
Yesterday's gone 
We gotta keep moving on 
I'm so thankful for the moments 
So glad I got to know ya 
The times that we had 
I'll keep like a photograph 
And hold you in my heart forever 
I'll always remember you
I'll always remember you
Yeah
I'll always remember you
