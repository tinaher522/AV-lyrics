<song artist="Miley_Cyrus" title="Life_Has_Its_Own_Route">
Life is like an unpaved road
Its just keeps on spinnin' with its bumps and turns
Ups and downs it's jumpin around!
You go through all hard times
You think you might not get through
Do I take a Right 
Or do I take a Left
Life just seems to ramble on no matter the situation
Life has its ups and downs
Sometimes you just need to get away
I know I've had my trouble 
Making my desicions
Sometimes they aren't so great
I seeem to make it through these

But times are gettin' harder and harder
You need a lot of parental support
They know the road and the ways of life 
and can help you make it through the day
After a while you'll get used to the road 
and the way that is going to be
I promise you'll get used to it...
You'll just have to see
Cause Life's Like a road 
and it must go on
and it seems like it goes on forever and ever..
But no day you will have to relize just how fast it stops.
