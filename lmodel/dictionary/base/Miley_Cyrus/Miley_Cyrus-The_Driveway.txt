<song artist="Miley_Cyrus" title="The_Driveway">
After twelve, not so well
Won't pretend it's too soon to tell
What's 'round this bend
No disgrace, about face
Anything not to have to chase
You down again
You know
Nothing hurts like losing
When ya know it's really gone
Except for the pain of choosin'
To hold too long
I tried it your way
But I got nothing to show
It's been the same, same
And the story's getting old
So I guess the driveway
Will be the end of the road
For us it's too late
Let the credits start to roll
A lot to say, but not today
Let the radio break the silence
As we drive
A kiss goodbye, not this time
Don't remember what about this song
I ever liked
You know
Nothing hurts like losing
When ya know I'm already gone
Except for the pain of choosin
To hold too long
I tried it your way
But I got nothing to show
It's been the same, same
And the story's getting old
So I guess the driveway
Will be the end of the road
For us it's too late
Let the credits start to roll
I thought maybe we were getting somewhere
But we're still nowhere at all
I watched your tail lights fading
I try but the tears won't fall
I remember what it feels like
To know love and have it taken away
I can't think of what I learned right now
But I'll be thanking you someday
I tried it your way
But I got nothing to show
You know, it's been the same, same
And the story's getting old
So I guess the driveway
Will be the end of the road
For us it's too late
Let the credits start to roll
Let the credits start to roll
So I guess the driveway
Will be the end of the road
(Be the end of the road)
Will be the end of the road
(Be the end of the road)
