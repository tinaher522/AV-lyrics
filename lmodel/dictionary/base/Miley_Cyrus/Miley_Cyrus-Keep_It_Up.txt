<song artist="Miley_Cyrus" title="Keep_It_Up">
Spoken: HEY! ARE YOU READY?!?!?!?!? SING WITH ME!
Do your best; you'll be better
Then you'll have to write a letter
Sometimes you can't make it
But you could always love it...
Chorus: KEEP IT UP AND YOU'LL MAKE IT
KEEP IT UP AND YOU WON'T REGRET IT!
LOVE IT AND YOU'LL SURVIVE
THEN HAVE A HAPPY LIFE...
I know that you have an inspiration
But you really need creation
Leave it to me 
And you'll disagree...
Chorus
Chorus      
Bye!!!!!!!!!!
