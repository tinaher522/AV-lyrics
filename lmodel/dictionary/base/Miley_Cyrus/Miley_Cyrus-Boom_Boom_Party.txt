<song artist="Miley_Cyrus" title="Boom_Boom_Party">
Boom Boom, Boom Boom, Boom 
I like that boom boom pow 
Them chicken jackin' my style 
They try copy my swagger 
I'm on that, on that, on that 
I hopped off the plane at LAX with a dream and a cardagain 
Welcome to the land of fame excess am i gonna fit in 
Jumped in the cab, here I am for the first time 
Look to my right and I see the Hollywood sign 
This is all so crazy, everybody seems so famous 
My tummys turnin and Im feelin kinda homesick 
Too much pressure and Im nervous 
Thats when the taxi man turned on the radio 
And the Jay-Z song was on 
And the Jay-Z song was on 
And the Jay-Z song was on 
So I put my hands up, they're playin my song 
The butterflies fly away, Im noddin my head like Yeah! 
Movin my hips like Yeah! 
Got my hands up, theyre playin my song 
They know Im gonna be okay 
Yeah! Its a party in the USA! 
Yeah! Its a party in the USA! 
Get to the club in my taxi cab, everybodys lookin at me now 
Like Whos that chick thats rockin kicks, shes gotta be from outta town 
So hard with my girls not around me 
Its definitely not a Nashville party cause all I see is stilettos 
I guess I never got the memo 
My tummys turnin and Im feelin kinda homesick 
Too much pressure and Im nervous 
Thats when the DJ dropped my favorite tune 
And the Britney song was on 
And the Britney song was on 
And the Britney song was on 
So I put my hands up, they're playin my song 
The butterflies fly away, Im noddin my head like Yeah! 
Movin my hips like Yeah! 
Got my hands up, theyre playin my song 
They know Im gonna be okay 
Yeah! Its a party in the USA! 
Yeah! Its a party in the USA! 
Feel like hoppin on a flight (on a flight) 
Back to my hometown tonight (town tonight) 
Something stops me everytime (everytime) 
The DJ plays my song and I feel alright 
So I put my hands up, they're playin my song 
The butterflies fly away, Im noddin my head like Yeah! 
Movin my hips like Yeah! 
Got my hands up, theyre playin my song 
They know Im gonna be okay 
Yeah! Its a party in the USA! 
Yeah! Its a party in the USA! 
So I put my hands up, they're playin my song 
The butterflies fly away, Im noddin my head like Yeah! 
Movin my hips like Yeah! 
Got my hands up, theyre playin my song 
They know Im gonna be okay 
Yeah! Its a party in the USA! 
Yeah! Its a party in the USA! 
Let the beat rock 
Let the beat rock 
Let the beat rock 
Let the beat rock
