<song artist="Miley_Cyrus" title="Something_About_Space_Dude">
Something in the way you love me
Something in the way you stare
I wanna be there skateboarding
In a space dude's evil lair
Something in the way you fuck me
You're never fucking there
Something in the way you touch me
I wonder, I should care
Okay, keep that last one
Sleeping is optimistic
But we can live without dreaming
It's the only time we can really be together
But I'm optimistic
There's something giving me that feeling
There's something giving me that feeling
There's something
There's something giving me that feeling
There's something
