<song artist="Miley_Cyrus" title="Trust_In_Me">
I know you and you know me
We can be what we wanna be
We can do our best all you have to do is try
I know it seems like far away
When you won't be livin' with your parents
But it comes all to fast
I lay at night

With a bright night light
And hot tears running down my face
Thinking about all the good times
And what my life would be with out my parents
Thinking about my room not being mine really gets to mee
So enjoy life and everything around you cause one day it might be gone
