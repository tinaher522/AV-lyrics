<song artist="Miley_Cyrus" title="Two_More_Lonely_People">
I need to feel your heartbeat 
When you say you love me
I don't want to hear it
If it's something that you don't mean
If I had to leave you now
There would be an empty space
It doesn't matter anyhow
You can take your things
And go your own way
And there's two more lonely people
In the world tonight
Baby you and I
Are just two more lonely people
Who gave up the fight
Yeah wrong or right
Well you know my heart is aching
You don't have to break it
Love don't change your mind
Then there's two more lonely people
Tonight
I don't want the pictures
I don't want your sympathy
We don't have to be friends
We don't have to be enemies
In my head I break it down
And I'm absolutely sure
That you and I could work it out
Or we could kill the lights
On what we had before
And there's two more lonely people
In the world tonight
Baby you and I
Are just two more lonely people
Who gave up the fight
Yeah wrong or right
Well you know my heart is aching
You don't have to break it
Love don't change your mind
Then there's two more lonely people
Well we got something special
That should be enough
Nothing is predictable when it comes to love
Maybe lately baby it's been a little rough
But if you walk away tonight
We'll be two more lonely people
In the world tonight
Baby you and I
Are just two more lonely people
Who gave up the fight
Yeah wrong or right
And there's two more lonely people
In the world tonight
Baby you and I
Are just two more lonely people
Who gave up the fight
Yeah wrong or right
Well you know my heart is aching
You don't have to break it
Love don't change your mind
Then there's two more lonely people
Tonight
