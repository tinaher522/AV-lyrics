<song artist="Miley_Cyrus" title="Need_A_Little_Love">
When the darkness leaves you lonely
Or the world tries to push you away
When you sky is looking troubled
You can count on me 'cuz I'm gonna stay
(I'm gonna stay)
Put you worries in my pocket
I got a key so we can lock it
I swear that I wont let them escape
Love, It's always worth it
Love, Everyone deserves it
It's a friend that holds you hand
When nobody understands
Love, It wants to heal you
Love, and see the real you
But you have to open up
When you need a little love
Yeahh yeah yeahh
Yeah, oh
If there's somthing your in need of
You only have to let me know
I've got a shoulder you can lean on
And I'm alway, always right up the road
Put your fears in my pocket
I gotta key so we can lock it
You know I, know I wont let them escape
Love, It's always worth it
Love, Everyone deserves it
It's a friend that holds you hand
When nobody understands
Love, It wants to heal you
Love, and see the real you
But you have to open up
When you need a little love
Every night when your heart is praying for peace
From the noise in you head
There's a light that is yours to keep
That's brighter than all the rest
Love, It's always worth it
Love, Everyone deserves it
It's a friend that holds you hand
When nobody understands
Love, It wants to heal you
Love, and see the real you
But you have to open up
When you need a little love
When you Need a little love
Oh
Need a little love
Na Na Na Yeah Yeah
Need a little love
