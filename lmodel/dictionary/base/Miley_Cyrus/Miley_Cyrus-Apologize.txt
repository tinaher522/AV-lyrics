<song artist="Miley_Cyrus" title="Apologize">
Verse 1
I wanna be a DJ, but I only do the rap
I live home with ma brotha, and that's a fact!
If there's one thing I would do, I'd make ev'rthing right
I'd pull up my sleeves, and take that fight!
Chorus
To make ev'rthing right,
There's one thing I would do!
I'd take out all my memories and laugh at you!
Verse 2
I called all my relatives, from the phone book
The only way to defeat you is with a stern look!
When everbody's crowdin' around, what do I say?
"Hey, boy, whatcha doin' ya made it this way!"
Chorus
To make ev'rthing right,
There's one thing I would do!
I'd take out all my memories and laught at you!
Bridge
But when I am through,
It doesn't feel right.
I think I did wrong.
Should I apologize?
Chorus
To make ev'rthing right,
There's one thing I would do!
I'd bring back all my memories and smile at you!
