<song artist="Miley_Cyrus" title="After_All">
After all 
The work is done
From struggles
I faced before
I saw the light
That shined bright
Right on ma face
With all its height
I know the world after all its ours
And i know know them brightly
They shine with colors 
Like green or blue
Other things that take place when its me and you
After all things are the same
As they have to be
After all the struggles
Its you and me
I feel safe under your shadow
It feels so nice to be with each other
After all i learned from you
To have to trouble to extend
The problem and find the solutions
After all its the others
That find us together 
I love you 
Thats the problem
I would love you all day
