<song artist="Miley_Cyrus" title="Gone_Are_The_Days">
Gone are the days of my past,
Gone are the days of my childhood innocence,
Gone are the days of my first and last.
Gone are the days of being carefree,
Gone are the days of my elation,
Gone are the days of my glee.
Gone are the days of my fear.
Gone are the days of savor.

Gone are the days I spent here.
Gone, Gone, Gone are the days 
And I fear
It's becoming more clear!
Gone, Gone, Gone are the days I spent hear.
