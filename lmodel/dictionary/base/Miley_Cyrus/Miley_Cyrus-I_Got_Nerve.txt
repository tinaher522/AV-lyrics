<song artist="Miley_Cyrus" title="I_Got_Nerve">
We haven't met, and that's okay
'Cause you will be asking for me one day
Don't want to wait in line
The moment is mine, believe me
Don't close your eyes
'Cause it's a chance worth takin'
And I think that I can shake you
I know where I stand
I know who I am
I would never run away when life gets bad, it's
Everything I see
Every part of me
Gonna get what I deserve
I got nerve
Electrified, I'm on a wire
Gettin' together and we're on fire
What I said, you heard
Now I've got you spinnin'
Don't close your mind
The words I use are open
And I think that I can show you
I know where I stand
I know who I am
I would never run away when life gets bad, it's
Everything I see
Every part of me
I know I can change the world, yeah, yeah, yeah
I know what you like
I know what you think
Not afraid to stare you down until you blink
It's everything I see
Every part of me
Gonna get what I deserve
I got nerve
You, you need to discover (discover)
Who can make you feel free
And I, I need to uncover
The part of you that's reaching out for me, hey
I know where I stand
I know who I am
I would never run away when life gets bad, it's
Everything I see
Every part of me
I know I can change the world, yeah, yeah, yeah
I know what you like
I know what you think
Not afraid to stare you down until you blink
It's everything I see
Every part of me
Gonna get what I deserve
I got nerve
I'm what you want (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm what you need (I got nerve)
I'm what you want
I'm what you need
I know what you like
I know what you think
Not afraid to stare you down until you blink
It's everything I see
Every part of me
Gonna get what I deserve
(I got)
I got nerve
