Sha la la la la
Sha la la la la
Verse 1:
You used to call me your angel
Said I was sent straight down from heaven
You'd hold me close in your arms
I thought the way you felt so strong
I never wanted you to leave
I wanted you to stay here holding me
Chorus:
I miss you
I miss your smile
And I still shed a tear
Every once in a while
And even though it's different now
You're still here somehow
My heart won't let you go
And I need you to know
I miss you
Sha la la la la
I miss you
Verse 2:
You used to call me your dreamer
And now I'm living out my dream 
Oh, how I wish you could see
Everything that's happening for me
I'm thinking back on the past
It's true that time's flying by too fast
Chorus:
I miss you
I miss your smile
And I still shed a tear
Every once in a while
And even though it's different now
You're still here somehow
My heart won't let you go
And I need you to know
I miss you
Sha la la la la
I miss you
Bridge:
I know your in a better place, yeah
But I wish that I could see your face so
I know you're where you need to be
Even though it's not here with me
Chorus:
I miss you
I miss your smile
And I still shed a tear
Every once in a while
And even though it's different now
Your still here somehow
My heart won't let you go
And I need you to know
I miss you
Sha la la la la
Chorus:
I miss you
I miss your smile
And I still shed a tear
Every once in a while
And even though it's different now
You're still here somehow
My heart won't let you go
And I need you to know
I miss you
Sha la la la la
I miss you
