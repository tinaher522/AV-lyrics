<song artist="Miley_Cyrus" title="My_Heart_Beats_For_Love">
I've been stranded on a lonely street
Got lost in the shadows, fell hard in the battle
Heard cries and the suffering
Walked through the darkness, left broken and heartless
I'm calling out, can you hear my voice?
I'm gonna find you through all the noise 
You know there's nothing that I wouldn't do
Shine your light, as I reach for you
My heart beats for love
My heart beats for love
It's the sound that I hear, tells me not to give up
It breathes in my chest and it runs through my blood
My heart beats for love
My heart beats for love
And I've been told at least a thousand times
It's not worth the struggle, the hurt or the trouble
I keep running up to these front lines
No, I won't surrender, I'll wait here forever
Standing here with my flag held high
Can't you see that it's worth the fight?
My heart beats for love
My heart beats for love
It's the sound that I hear, tells me not to give up
It breathes in my chest and it runs through my blood
My heart beats for love
My heart beats for love
I march across this battlefield
I'm screaming out, can you hear me now?
I'm holding on, I stand my ground
I'm screaming out, can you hear me now?
My heart beats for love
My heart beats for love
It's the sound that I hear, tells me not to give up
It breathes in my chest and it runs through my blood
My heart beats for love
My heart beats for love
My heart beats for love
My heart beats for love
It's the sound that I hear, tells me not to give up
It breathes in my chest and it runs through my blood
My heart beats for love
My heart beats for love
