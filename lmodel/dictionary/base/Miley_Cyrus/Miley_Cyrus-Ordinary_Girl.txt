<song artist="Miley_Cyrus" title="Ordinary_Girl">
Don’t get me wrong – I love who I am 
I don’t wanna be ungrateful –
 it probably sounds strange
I really love the role I play – the songs I sing –
 but with all the fame 
The things that seemed so simple –
 are suddenly so far out of reach 
I wish that they could see that underneath
I’m just an ordinary girl sometimes
I’m lazy – I get bored – I get scared – I feel ignored 
I feel happy, I get silly – I choke on my own words 
I make wishes, I have dreams, and I still want to believe
Anything can happen in this world – for an ordinary girl 
Like you, like me, for an ordinary girl, like you, like me
How are you, hello goodbye
One day here, one day there and again it’s time to go
Ms. popular, always on the road
Put my best foot forward, gotta get on with the show
Strike a pose for the front cover of a magazine
everywhere I arrive I get high fives
They paint me larger than life
I’m just an ordinary girl sometimes
I’m lazy – I get bored – I get scared – I feel ignored 
I feel happy, I get silly – I choke on my own words 
I make wishes, I have dreams, and I still want to believe
Anything can happen in this world – for an ordinary girl 
Like you, like me, for an ordinary girl, like you, like me
So give it everything or nothing at all
Get back up on your feet when you stumble and fall
A little luck can go a long way
So don’t you worry about what people say
Who knows where the wind may blow
For an ordinary girl
I’m just an ordinary girl 
Sometimes I’m lazy – I get bored – 
 I get scared – I feel ignored 
I feel happy, I get silly – 
 I choke on my own words 
I make wishes, I have dreams, 
And I still want to believe
Anything can happen in this world – 
 for an ordinary girl 
Like you, like me, for an ordinary girl, 
like you, like me
For an ordinary girl, for an ordinary girl, 
 like you, like me
