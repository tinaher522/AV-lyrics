<song artist="Miley_Cyrus" title="Every_Day">
Everday, 
Something happens to me.
And you'll see,
I'm on my way
I want to be changed.
I want to be rearranged yeah.
Open a door, 
In my life that's such a bore.
Full of life, 
full of dreams.
That's what I want to be.
A new chapter in my book,

gonna write my own story.
I want to be changed,
I want to be rearranged yeah. 
Open a door,
In my life that's such a bore!
can you change me 
can you make me into something that im not 
can you open a door into the world of rearranged 
the one thats better than the bore im living in
make my dreams come true let me aim for the stars and make it to the moon
