<song artist="Miley_Cyrus" title="Things_Happen_For_A_Reason">
things happen for a reason
no matter what's goin' on
I can be here every season if you want ( if you want)
Just one thing you need to know
that I got you're back, for sure
(Chorus)
Things happen for a reason
no matter what you do
they keep comin' round every time your down
Things happen for a reason
even when it happens again
there's nothin' to show it after all,
Things happen for a reason
