<song artist="Miley_Cyrus" title="Aim_Towards_You">
It hurts me inside
Even if i don't show it 
You tear me apart 
Even if you don't know it 
My heart is dying 
Whoa ohh
You don't think the words
You say hurt me but they do...
I'm sick of you 
Your stupid lies
All that dispise
I aim towards you 
I aim towards you 
This bow and arrow anit for love
I aim towards you 
I aim towards you 
People think we like each other 
But your really my foe 
You try to hurt me inside 
But i can look at you and say so 
The pain coming out of your mouth 
It's really low 
Whoa 
You don't think the words you say makes mr wan't to runaway...
I hate today 
Your stupid lies
All that despise
I aim towards you 
I aim towards you 
This bow and arrow anit for love
I aim towards you 
I aim towards you 
Will sombody help me 
Please sombody hel me 
Just reach out and grab my hand 
You say it's my fault 
You say it's my fault 
You hide behind the sorry that you have 
Your stupid lies
All that despise
I aim towards you 
I aim towards you 
This bow and arrow anit for love
I aim towards you 
I aim towards you 
I aim towards you 
WHOA
