<song artist="Miley_Cyrus" title="Just_Like_You">
Ooh, yeah
So what you see, is only half the story
There's another side of me
I'm a girl you know, but I'm someone else too
If you only knew
It's a crazy life
But I'm alright
I got everything I've always wanted
Living the dream
So yeah, everything I've always wanted
Isn't always what it seems
I'm a lucky girl
Whose dreams came true
But underneath it all 
I'm just like you
Don't want to be treated differently
I want to keep it all inside
Half the time I've got my name in lights
The other half I'm by your side
It's a crazy life 
But I'm just fine
I got everything I've always wanted
Living the dream
So yeah everything I've always wanted
Isn't always what it seems
I'm a lucky girl
Whose dreams came true
But underneath it all 
I'm just like you
Yeah, yeah
Can't you see I'm just an ordinary girl?
Ooh, ooh
Living in an extraordinary world
Trying to live
Trying to love
Trying to just be who I am
Who I am
I got everything I've always wanted
Living the dream
So yeah everything I've always wanted
Isn't always what it seems
I'm a lucky girl
Whose dreams came true
But underneath it all 
I'm just like you
I got everything I've always wanted
Living the dream
So yeah everything I've always wanted
Isn't always what it seems
I'm a lucky girl
Whose dreams came true
But underneath it all 
I'm just like you
