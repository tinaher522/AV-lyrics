<song artist="Miley_Cyrus" title="The_Other_Side_Of_Me">
The other side
The other side
The other side of me
By day, I play
The part in every way
Of simple sweet, calm and collected
Pretend, to my friends
I'm a chameleon
Can make a girl feel disconnected
Feel like a star
A super hero
Sometimes it's hard to separate
(Got too much on my plate)
If you could see
The other side of me
I'm just like anybody else, can't you tell
I hold the key (the key)
To both realities
The girl that I want you to know
If only I could show
The other side, the other side
I want you to see
The other side, the other side
The other side of me
Inside, I try
To make the pieces fit right
A jigsaw puzzle everywhere
'Cause I flip the script
So many times I forget
Who's on stage, who's in the mirror
Back in the spotlight
The crowd is calling
The paparazzi and the fame
(It can drive a girl insane)
If you could see
The other side of me
I'm just like anybody else, can't you tell
I hold the key
To both realities
The girl that I want you to know
If only I could show
The other side, the other side
I want you to see
The other side, the other side
The other side of me
Down inside I'm not that different
Like everyone I have a dream
Don't wanna hide just wanna fit in
Sometimes it's harder than it seems
If you could see
The other side of me
I'm just like anybody else, can't you tell
I hold the key
To both realities
The girl that I want you to know
If you could see
The other side of me
I'm just like anybody else, can't you tell
I hold the key (the key)
To both realities
The girl that I want you to know
If only I could show (yeah)
The other side, the other side
I want you to see (yeah!)
The other side, the other side
The other side of me
The other side, the other side
I want you to see
The other side, the other side of me
