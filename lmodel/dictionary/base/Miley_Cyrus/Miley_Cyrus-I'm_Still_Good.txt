<song artist="Miley_Cyrus" title="I'm_Still_Good">
So I might slip again,
Let it in now and then,
that won't mean anything,
I'm still good
I looked around me,
How did I get here?
Not part of my plan
I ended up in a situation
Wasn't in my hands
I think about it
When I wanna get up,
How to keep on goin'
How to keep my chin up
Somehow I know it
I'm not gonna give up
Never gonna give up
So I might slip again,
Let it in now and then
That won't mean anything
I'm still good
Trying to be my best
When I fall it's a mess
Pick myself up again,
I'm still good
I'm still good!
I'm still good!
When days are like that,
and I can shake 'em,
It's weighing on my mind
So I'm just sayin'
I'm only human
Life get's you down sometimes
I think about it,
when I wanna get up
How to keep on goin'
How to keep my chin up
Somehow I know it
I'm not gonna give up,
never gonna give up
So I might slip again
Let it in now and then
That don't mean anything,
I'm still good
Trying to be my best,
when I fall it's a mess
Pick myself up again,
I'm still good
So I might slip again
Let it in now and then
That won't mean anything,
I'm still good
Trying to be my best
when I fall it's a mess
Pick myself up again,
I'm still good
Life puts up a fight with me
But I can take on anything
I'm gonna make it real,
this dream I believe in
I think about it
when I wanna get up
How to keep on goin'
how to keep my chin up
Somehow I know it
I'm not gonna give up
Never gonna give up
oh, oh, oh!
So I might slip again,
let it in now and then
that won't mean anything,
I'm still good
Trying to be my best
When I fall it's a mess
Pick myself up again
I'm still good
So I might slip again,
let it in now and then
That won't mean anything,
I'm still good
Trying to be my best,
when I fall it's a mess
Pick myself up again,
I'm still good
I'm still good
Pick myself up again
I'm still good.
I'm still.
I'm still good.
