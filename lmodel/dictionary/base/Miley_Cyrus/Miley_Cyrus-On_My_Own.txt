<song artist="Miley_Cyrus" title="On_My_Own">
Hey
I ain't looking at you for no particular reason
It touches the spot for me to be in
I gotta open that door, hey
I'm breaking way through, just like the robber
And smile for the camera damn, I feel awesome
Push it open a little bit more, hey
Gotta get open, yeah
You will never listen when I need someone to talk to
So you switch the subject cause
cause it's beyond you
When you talk about your dreams, I'm never included
I need to stop sleeping on myself
Wake up and do it on my own
I found a way, yeah
And I'll do it on my on, hey
I can do anything, yeah
And I'll do it on my own
Can't you get it done with the help from no one
I came into this world by myself
So I don't need nobody else
We have just begun so much to do, so young
Don't be afraid be alone
You're get it done on your own
I know you're in there open up, open up
Just like the feds, looking for the stuff
Three knocks at the door
I gotta get it open
I'm so confused with all the traffic
I'mma skip line who cars what happens
I gotta stay on that course
I gotta get it open
You will never listen when I need someone to talk to
So you switch the subject cause
cause it's beyond you
And when you talk about your dreams, I'm never included
I need to stop sleeping on myself
Wake up and do it on my own, hey
I found a way, yeah
And I'll do it on my on, hey
I can do anything, yeah
And I'll do it on my own
Can't you get it done with the help from no one
I came into this world by myself
So I don't need nobody else
We have just begun, so much to do so young
Don't be afraid to be alone
You're get it done on your own
You're get it done on your own
