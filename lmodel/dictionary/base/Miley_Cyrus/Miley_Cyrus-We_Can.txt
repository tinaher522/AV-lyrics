<song artist="Miley_Cyrus" title="We_Can">
Goin in   to a new grade     gonna meet many new friends     unexplainable things will happen to you     gonna make different grades     gonna learn many new things     boys, friends, crushes, sports and such      
We can do anything    if we try     all we gotta do is say to ourselves     that      
We can, we can do anything if we just believe and know that nothings stopping us     just believe and know that    , we can, we can do anything when out hearts are set and out minds are ready to go      we can     do anything when we try     , 
Theres many things around this world that we think aren't even possible    ,

We can wait to see the day, when all our dreams are comin' true      their not flashin by to fast, their not flashin by to fast cause we know        
We can, we can do anything when our hearts are set and we know that nothings stopping us     we can, we can do anthing when  we just believe and our minds are ready to go     we can     we can     we can, we can, we can, we can 
No matter what goes on     our hearts are gonna be set, our dreams are gonna happen     all we gotta do is believe that       , oh      

We can, we can do anything weather its fill our dreams or write new songs     we can, we can do anything all you gotta do is reach for your dreams     and know that      , 
We can, we can do anything weather its in our hearts or in the world     , we can, we can do anything weather its up on stage or in the crowd     , 
We can, we do anything! We can, we can do anything! We can, we can do anything!
We can, we can do anything that our hearts, our minds, our souls are all chal lenged too    , we can, we can do anything when we just believe and know that God is on our side     yeah we can       
We can       
No matter what      oh     
WE CAN!
