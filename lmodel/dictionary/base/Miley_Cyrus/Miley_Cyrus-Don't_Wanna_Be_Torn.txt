<song artist="Miley_Cyrus" title="Don't_Wanna_Be_Torn">
Maybe it's the things I say
Maybe I should think before I speak
But I thought that I knew enough
To know myself and do what's right for me
And these walls I'm building now
You used to bring em down
And the tears I'm crying out
You used to wipe away
I thought you said it was easy
Listening to your heart
I thought you said I'd be okay
So why am I breaking apart
Don't wanna be torn
Don't wanna be torn
Don't wanna be torn
Don't wanna be torn
Don't make me have to choose between
What I want and what you think I need
Cause I'll always be your little girl
But even little girls have got to dream
Now it all feels like a fight
You were always on my side
And the lonely I feel now
You used to make it go away
I thought you said it was easy
Listening to your heart
I thought you said I'd be okay
So why am I breaking apart
Don't wanna be torn
Why is all this so confusing
Complicated and consuming
Why does all this make me angry
I wanna go back to being happy
These tears I'm crying now 
You used to wipe away
I thought you said it was easy
Listening to your heart
I thought you said I'd be okay
So why am I breaking apart
Don't wanna be torn
Don't wanna be torn
Don't wanna be torn
Don't wanna be torn
Don't wanna be torn
Don't wanna be torn
Don't wanna be torn
Don't wanna be torn.
