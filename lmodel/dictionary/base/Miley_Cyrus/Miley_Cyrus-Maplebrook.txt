<song artist="Miley_Cyrus" title="Maplebrook">
Our teachers kept us safe 
For Sure
I'm Sure
I don't know about any other school because 
I belong to Maplebrook 
I belong to this district too

Same with you
I love this place don't you
Don't be afraid to say yes or no
'Cause I know you love this place 
As much as I do
