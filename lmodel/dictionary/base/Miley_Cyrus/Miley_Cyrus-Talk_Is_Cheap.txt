Ay Ay Ay Ay Ay Ay
Woohoo Woohoo
Ay Ay Ay Ay Ay Ay
Woohoo Woohoo
I belong with just me
And I'm Watchin TV and I'm always
Oh so bored at home
I get up I get out drive my car
Way down town
Keep on calling but your never around
See my friends out tonight
Under these city lights
In the club
Til someone starts a fight
Then we get in the car
Still don't know where you are
I'm so pissed off
Always hanging around
I'm so tired
Your Fired!
I'm so jealous restless relentless,
That's just me.
I'm so crazy lately c'mon and
Let it be...
Don't make me beg for the things
I need
You know what they say
Where there's a Will there's a Way
Lies are free
Talk is Cheap
Ay Ay Ay Ay Ay Ay
Woohoo Woohoo
Now were out in the street
And were sweatin the heat
And we move with the traffic and the beat
I don't care if you choke
When you light up your smoke
It's the one that I can call my own
It's so tragic
I'm so many
I'm so jealous restless relentless
That's just me.
I'm so crazy lately c'mon and
Let it be...
Don't make me beg for the things
I need
You know what they say
Where there's a Will there's a Way
Lies are free
Talk is Cheap
Ay Ay Ay Ay Ay Ay
Woohoo Woohoo
I'm so Tired
Your fired!
I'm so jealous restless
That's just me.
I'm so crazy lately c'mon and
Let it be...
Don't make me beg for the things
I need
You know what they say
Where there's a Will there's a Way
Lies are free.
Talk is Cheap
Ay Ay Ay Ay Ay Ay
Woohoo Woohoo
Ay Ay Ay Ay Ay Ay
Woohoo Woohoo
Talk is Cheap
Ay Ay Ay Ay Ay Ay
Woohoo Woohoo
Ay Ay Ay Ay Ay Ay
Woohoo Woohoo
