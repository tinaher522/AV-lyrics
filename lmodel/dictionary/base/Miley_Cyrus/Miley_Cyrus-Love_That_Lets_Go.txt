<song artist="Miley_Cyrus" title="Love_That_Lets_Go">
There's a gold frame
That sits by the window
And my heart breaks
A little more each time I try
To picture the memory inside
There's a notebook,
That's too hard to read it
But if you look
You'd see how you look through my eyes
But now one more chapter's gone by
And I know
It's time to move on
Even though I'm not ready
You've got to be strong
And trust where you're heading
Even though it's not easy (not easy)
Right now the right kind of love
Doesn't wanna miss the future
Or stand in the past
It will always hold on
Never hold you back
And even though it's not easy (not easy),
I know the right kind of love
Is love that lets go (It's time to say hey)
It's love that let's go
