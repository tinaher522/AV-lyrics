<song artist="Miley_Cyrus" title="Oh_Wait,_It's_Me">
Yeah, yeah...
Oh yeah...
Yeah me...
Yeah its me...
Oh...
(Verse One)
Look at that sexy girl
The one walkin down the street
You wish you could meet her, oh
And that girl is me
(Chorus)
OH, she's me.
That girl you've been longing to meet
Who's that pretty girl in the mirror?
Damn...
Oh wait, it's me.
(Verse Two)
I see a horror in the mirror
And I want  her in bed so bad
Ha, then I realize that girl is me
Damn she is so rad!

(Chorus)
OH, she's me.
That girl you've been longing to meet
Who's that pretty slut in the mirror?
Damn...
Oh wait, it's me.
(Bridge)
If only I was someone else...
(oh-oh)
How I wish I was someone else...
(oh-yeah)
So I could date myself!
(Chorus)
OH, she's me.
That girl you've been longing to meet
Who's that pretty bitch in the mirror?
damn...
Oh wait, it's me.
Oh wait, it's me.
Oh, it's me.
