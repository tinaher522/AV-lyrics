<song artist="Miley_Cyrus" title="The_Bone_Dance">
Everybody knows the bones
Just had to find a way
Everyone what im talkin bout
Thats how I'll get an A
My body's many parts
And this is where it starts
Phalanges I have ten
And Metatarsals then
I got some Tarsals too
I'll put them in my shoe
Oliver:(Shes Tellin The Truth)
The Fibula is next
According to my text
Then comes the Tibia
That ain't no Fibia
And now up to my knee,
yeah, yeah, yeah
That's the patella to me
We're doing the bone dance
You study the answers
Again and again til I get it right

We're doing the bone dance
You dance and you learn it
And we won't mess up this test
We'll get it perfect
And now I take it home
With the Parietal bone
It might be crazy
But we learn that way
Temporal and frontal too
And now we're finally through
That makes two hundred &amp; six
I found a way that clicks
Bone Thugs in the house
We're doing the bone dance
You study the answers
Again and again till I get it right
We're doing the bone dance
You dance and you learn it
And we won't mess up this test
We'll get it perfect
Word!
