<song artist="Miley_Cyrus" title="Let's_Do_This">
I rode all night on a big old bus
You came a long way to be with us
You paid good money
To see a show 
You best get ready
Cause here we go
Get on your feet
Cause I'm plugged in
So come on
Let's do this
I'll turn it on
I'll crank it up
I'll show you all what I'm made of
I'll get loud
I'll wear it out
I'll bring the roof in this house down
I know just what you came here for
And I want to hear you scream and more
Get on your feet
You know you can't resist
(Yeah yeah yeah)
Let's do this
(Na na na na na na)
(Uh, huh, Uh, huh)
(Na na na na na na)
(Let's do this)
(Na na na na na na)
(Uh, huh, Uh, huh)
(Na na na na na na)
Don't call this work
But I'm paid to play
And the real party starts backstage
And all my friends
They sing my songs
I wish you all could come along
To take a picture
To show your friends
So come on
Let's do this
I'll turn it on
I'll crank it up
I'll show you all what I'm made of
I'll get loud
I'll wear it out
I'll bring the roof in this house down
I know just what you came here for
And I want to hear you scream and more
Get on your feet
You know you can't resist
(Oh)
Let's do this
(Na na na na na na)
(Uh, huh, Uh, huh)
(Na na na na na na)
(Let's do this)
(Na na na na na na)
(Uh, huh, Uh, huh)
(Na na na na na na)
Everybody
Come on now's the time to get loud
Throw your hands up
And let me hear you shout it out
All my people
Let me see you jumping up and down
Let me hear the words
You know
You know I'm singing now
Freak out
Scream, shout
This is what it's all about
Let me hear the hook now
I'll turn it on
I'll crank it up
I'll show you all what I'm made of
I'll get loud
I'll wear it out
I'll bring the roof in this house down
I know just what you came here for
And I want to hear you scream and more
Get on your feet
You know you can't resist
Let's do this
(Na na na na na na)
(Uh, huh, Uh, huh)
Let's do this
(Na na na na na na)
Oh
(Let's do this)
(Na na na na na na)
(Uh, huh, Uh, huh)
Whoa
(Na na na na na na)
Let's do this!
