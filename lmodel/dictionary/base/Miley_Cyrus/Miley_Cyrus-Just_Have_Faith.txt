<song artist="Miley_Cyrus" title="Just_Have_Faith">
The world is...a pleasant place
Its where we spend all of our days
We need to take care of it
So it will last forever
Dont take the beauty from us
Just take care of our world
We used to be able to drink from unpurified water and have a picnic on the unlettered grass
Its takes more than one person to change the world today
But if we spread the word to word

It will get to some people some day
Just have faith
Just have faith
We can do it together
I know for a fact that one little person could save this world one day
Just have faith
Just have faith
And we will see what happens to the world one day
