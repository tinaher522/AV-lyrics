<song artist="Miley_Cyrus" title="Right_Now">
When I see you, I close my eyes . Everything's dark, it's not a lie.
We dance together in the moonlit sky. 
We hold each others hand tight and say "don't let go."
CHORUS 
"cause right here is the right time, don't leave me now, ohhhh." I can't stay tonight. I left without you .but I couldn't live without you. 
CHORUS times 2
