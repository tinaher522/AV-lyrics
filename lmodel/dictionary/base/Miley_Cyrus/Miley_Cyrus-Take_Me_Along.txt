<song artist="Miley_Cyrus" title="Take_Me_Along">
The city of angels is lonely at night
Keep myself alive by candlelight
Say she can't love you like I do
Look me in the eyes and say it's true
I ask myself is this love at all?
When I need you most you let me fall
I'm always here at the side of your stage
Let you live your life, pretend I'm okay
(Don't you know that this ain't over?) I'll be okay
I'll hold you close we'll stay forever
I, I don't understand why you're leaving me
I, I don't understand how without you I can't breathe
Please don't, don't leave me here
Take my hand, I'll plead in tears
I don't understand why you can't take me with you
You can pretend I don't exist
But you see my face every time you kiss
I hope you hurt and your walls fall down
When you hear the sound that I'm okay
(Don't you know that this ain't over?) I'll be okay
You can't hold me down, I won't stay forever
I, I don't understand why you're leaving me
I, I don't understand how without you I can't breathe
Please don't, don't leave me here
Take my hand, I'll plead in tears
I don't understand why you can't take me with you
I watch you leave, walk away tonight
And I'm letting go for the last time
And through the tears I say goodbye
So breathe in, breathe in, breathe in, breathe out
I, I don't understand why you're leaving me
And I, I don't understand how without you I can't breathe
Please don't, don't leave me here
Take my hand, I'll plead in tears
I don't understand why you can't take me with you
(I, I don't understand) Don't understand
(Why you're leaving me) Why you're leaving me
(I, I don't understand) How without you I can't breathe
Please don't, don't leave me here
Take my hand, I'll plead in tears
I don't understand why you can't take me with you
