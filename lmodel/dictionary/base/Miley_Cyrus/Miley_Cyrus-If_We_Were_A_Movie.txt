Uh oh
There you go again, talkin' cinematic
Yeah you, you're charming
Got everybody starstruck
I know, how you always seem to go
For the obvious, instead of me
But get a ticket and you'll see
If we were a movie,
You'd be the right guy
And I'd be the best friend
That you'd fall in love with
In the end, we'd be laughin'
Watchin' the sunset
Fade to black, show the names,
Play the happy song
(Yeah)
Yeah, yeah
When you call me,
I can hear it in your voice
Oh sure, wanna see me and tell me all about her
La, la
I'll be actin' through my tears
Guess you'll never know
That I should win an Oscar for this scene I'm in
If we were a movie,
You'd be the right guy
And I'd be the best friend
That you'd fall in love with
In the end, we'd be laughin'
Watchin' the sunset
Fade to black, show the names,
Play the happy song
Wish I could tell you there's a twist
Some kind of hero in disguise
And we're together, it's for real, now playin'
Wish I could tell you there's a kiss
Like somethin' more than in my mind
I see it
Could be amazing (Could be amazing)
(If we were a movie) If we were a movie,
You'd be the right guy (Right guy)
And I'd be the best friend
That you'd fall in love with
In the end, we'd be laughin'
Watchin' the sunset
Fade to black, show the names,
Play the happy song
(If we were) If we were a movie,
You'd be the right guy (You'd be)
And I'd be the best friend
That you'd fall in love with
In the end, we'd be laughin'
Watchin' the sunset
Fade to black, show the names,
Play the happy song (Yeah)
If we were a movie,
You'd be the right guy
And I'd be the best friend
That you'd fall in love with
In the end, we'd be laughin'
Watchin' the sunset
Fade to black, show the names,
Play the happy song
