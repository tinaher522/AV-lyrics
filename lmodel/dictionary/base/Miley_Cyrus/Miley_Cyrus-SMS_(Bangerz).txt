Bangerz (bangerz), fucking bangerz (bangerz)
Bangerz (bangerz), fucking bangerz (bangerz)
All the way in the back with a tree on my lap
All the boys like to ask me "What you doing with that?"
You, you, you say you love me, I ain't fooling with that
They ask me how I keep a man, I keep a battery pack
One day he wants me, one day he wants me not
I don't do chances, cause time just ain't what I got
If he's like that, I got a world tour that they need me at
I can't be sitting 'round here waiting on a man
To tell me where the fuck my seat be at, where Mike WiLL at?
Bangerz (bangerz), I be strutting my stuff
Bangerz (bangerz), fucking bangerz (bangerz)
Bangerz (bangerz), I be strutting my stuff
Bangerz (bangerz), I be strutting my stuff
I'm flying high up on a bird like a phobiac
My slick quarter, eye down my purse, where the dollars at?
I let them know the rents due on the first, they can call a hearse
'Cause if there's any violation I go off with that
Cat walk, slick talk, flirting with them big dogs
(Why do I need mili's when I got Billy on the speed dial?)
(You know I'm on that meow) Quick to scratch your eyes out
Strutting on the court, make them nervous, calling time out
Bangerz (bangerz), I be strutting my stuff
Bangerz (bangerz), fucking bangerz (bangerz)
Bangerz (bangerz), I be strutting my stuff
Bangerz (bangerz), I be strutting my stuff
The play boss, the play, got to get that big rocks
Sit back on my hey, make that mean old big talk
The play boss, the play, sike that must be the purple
Got up in my brain, had me a little bit dismal
Bangerz (bangerz), fucking bangerz (bangerz)
Bangerz (bangerz), fucking bangerz (bangerz)
Bangerz (bangerz), fucking bangerz (bangerz)
Bangerz (bangerz), fucking bangerz (bangerz)
