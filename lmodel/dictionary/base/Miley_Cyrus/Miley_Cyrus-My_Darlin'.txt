<song artist="Miley_Cyrus" title="My_Darlin'">
I brought the bowl of water and I seen the shadow of a broken-hearted girl
Pictured us walking through the alter, I bet I over worked
Why don't you stand, stand by me? Oh, my darling, stand by me
We gon' make a movie, a movie and it's gon' be a 3D, a 3D
We gon' make a movie, a movie and it's gon' be a 3D, 3D
Why don't you stand, stand by me? Oh, my darling, stand by me
I ain't find romance but you still got me sweating
What happened to that feeling? We'll never get it back
I ain't take no shots but you still got me hot
What happened to that feeling? I wish it wouldn't stop
We were supposed to be together
We were supposed to be together
They say that love can hit you so fast
And the odds are running out of time
But ours is on the border walk baby
Take me as I am or not
I can't breathe without you, without you as mine
Why don't you stand, stand by me? Oh, my darling, stand by me
We gon' make a movie, a movie and it's gon' be a 3D, a 3D
We gon' make a movie, a movie and it's gon' be a 3D, 3D
Why don't you stand, stand by me? Oh, my darling, stand by me
We gon' make a movie, a movie and it's gon' be a 3D, a 3D
We gon' make a movie, a movie and it's gon' be a 3D, 3D
Why don't you stand, stand by me? Oh, my darling, stand by me
