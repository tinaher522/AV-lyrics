<song artist="Adele" title="Many_Shades_Of_Black">
Go ahead, go ahead and
Smash it on the floor
Take whatever is left
And take it with you out the door
See if I cry
See if I shed a single sorry tear
Can't say that it's been that great
No, in fact it's been a wasted worried year
Everybody sees
And everyone agrees
That you and I are wrong
And it's been that way to long
Take it as it comes
And be thankful when it's done
'Cause there's so many ways to act
And there's many shades of black
There's so many shades of black
There's so many shades of black
Let it out, let it all out
Say what's on your mind
You can kick and scream, and
Shout and say things that are so unkind
Yeah, See if I care
See if I stand firm or if I fall
'Cause in the back of my mind
And on the tip of my tongue
Is the answer to it all
Everybody sees
And everyone agrees
That you and I are wrong
And it's been that way to long
So take it as it comes
And be thankful when it's done
There's so many ways to act
And there's many shades of black
Yeah, there's so many shades of black
Yeah, there's many shades of black.....
Everybody sees
And everyone agrees
That you and I are wrong
And it's been that way to long
Baby, take it as it comes
And be thankful when it's done
There are many ways to act
And you cannot take it back (many shades)
Oh, you cannot take it back (of black)
'Cause, there's many shades of black (many shades)
You have many shades of black (of black)
You have many, You have many (shades of black)
You have many shades of black (shades of black)
There's so many shades of black (many shades)
And so many shades of black (of black)
There's so many shades of black
There's so many shades of black
Ooohhh ohhhh...
