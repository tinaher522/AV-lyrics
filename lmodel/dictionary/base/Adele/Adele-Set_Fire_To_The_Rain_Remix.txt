<song artist="Adele" title="Set_Fire_To_The_Rain_Remix">
I should have laughed but no rest
Cold night mess, but no sweat
The reality of her I can't stand next
To anything she...
Trying to swallow pain with no...
Steady rising from the feet with no letter
Seeing death in the eye would matter
So I only realize that when I give a life
My love gave birth to the feeling that this was God's plan
Earth on fire, powers..
As walked hand in hand with the Earth
But the sun's quite, cause your talk for forever was so loud!
Was it worth it to let me die?
I'm still standing...
But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name!
But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name!
A life in the world...
A flight I take to see a hard...
Every love deserves to see what truth can
Bring the light, no matter dog fight
Dropping your heroin, save it for the night!
You told me...
No touch, no eye... starring in the eyes... no trust!
Your mind was already made up
When I see your soul ...
Reminiscent what we had was fragmented
Drunk in my thoughts and vision
I close my eyes, the angels want me to listen
To my heart, the only thing that was missing!
But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name!
But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name!
So many chances, so many answers
The reason we are far from the damage
The reason we go away to manage
The way we feel about love, about life
The other things I said before...
Before the... was written
Giving a life... would give me
To help you!
But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name!
But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name!
