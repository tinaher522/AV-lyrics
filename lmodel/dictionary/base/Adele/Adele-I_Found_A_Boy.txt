<song artist="Adele" title="I_Found_A_Boy">
I thought I told you he'd be home soon
Couldn't help myself, you're too good to be true
I fall short each time, every time he ain't here
You and your charm creep closer, closer in here
Like a fool for fire I fall, with my pride and all
Like a bomb before explosion, ticking by your call
You're the wiser one, disguised from greed
And I'm just a child who belongs on her knees
But I found a boy who I love more
Than I ever did you before
So stand beside the river, I cried
And let yourself down
Look how you want me now that I don't need you
So, you thought that I would crumble to my knees
At the first sight of you crawling back to me
To whisper, will you leave your man?
'Cause you swear that this time you can stand by me
I won't stand by you
'Cause I found a boy who I love more
Than I ever did you before
So stand beside the river, I cried
And let yourself down
Look how you want me now that I don't need you
I ain't yours for no taking
You must be mistaken
I could never look in your eyes and settle for wrong
And ignore the right
Well I found a boy who loves me more
Than you ever did before
So stand beside the river, you'll cry
And let yourself down
Look how you want me now that I don't need you
