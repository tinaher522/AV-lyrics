<song artist="Adele" title="Tired">
Hold my hand while you cut me down
It had only just begun but now its over now
And your in the heat of moments with your heart playing up cold
I'm between the middle watching hastiness unfold
In my eyes your were smiling in the spotlight dancing with the night
The night
Fell off your mind
I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what and for what and for what
When I don't get nothing back
Boy I'm tired
Where'd you go when you stay behind
I looked up and inside down and outside only to find
A double taking punching hard and laughing at my smile
I get closer you obviously prefer her
I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what and for what and for what
When I don't get nothing back
Boy I'm tired of trying
Your teasing aint enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what and for what and for what
When I don't get nothing back
Boy I'm tired
(I should have known)
Never mind said your open arms
I couldn't help believe the trick me back into them even tho
I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what and for what and for what
When I don't get nothing back
Boy I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
Then I don't get nothing back
And for what and for what and for what
When I don't get nothing back
Boy I'm tired
