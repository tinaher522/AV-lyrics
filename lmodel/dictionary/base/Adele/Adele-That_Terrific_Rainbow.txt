<song artist="Adele" title="That_Terrific_Rainbow">
My life had no color, before I met you
What could have been duller, the times I went through
You weakened my resistance, and colored my existence
I'm happy, and unhappy too
I'm a red hot Mama, but I'm blue for you
I get purple with anger, at the things you do
And I'm green with envy, when you meet a dame
But you burn my heart up with an orange flame.
I'm a red hot mama, but you white and cold
Don't you know your Mama has a heart of gold
Though we're in those gray clouds, someday you see
That terrific rainbow over you and me.
