<song artist="Adele" title="Hiding_My_Heart">
This is how the story went:
I met someone by accident
Who blew me away, blew me away
And it was in the darkest of my days
When you took my sorrow and you took my pain
And buried them away, buried them away
I wish I could lay down beside you when the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known, you'll disappear one day
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away
Dropped you off at the train station
Put a kiss on top of your head
And watched you wave, and watched you wave
Then I went on home to my skyscrapers
Neon lights and waiting papers
That I call home, I call that home
I wish I could lay down beside you when the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known, you'll disappear one day
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away
Away, yeah...
Woke up feeling heavyhearted
I'm going back to where I started
The morning rain, the morning rain
And though I wish that you were here
On that same old road that brought me here
It's calling me home, it's calling me home
I wish I could lay down beside you when the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known, you'll disappear one day
So I'll spend my whole life hiding my heart away
I can't spend my whole life hiding my heart away
