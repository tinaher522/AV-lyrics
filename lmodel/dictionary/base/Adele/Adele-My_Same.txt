<song artist="Adele" title="My_Same">
You're set in stone and I never give in 
I think you're stubborn 'cept you're always softening 
You say I'm selfish, I agree with you on that 
I think you're giving off way too much in fact 
I say we've only known each other one year 
You say, "Pff, I've known you longer my dear"
You like to be so close, I like to be alone 
I like to sit on chairs and you prefer the floor 
Walking with each other, think we'll never match at all, but we do 
But we do, but we do, but we do
I thought I knew myself, somehow you know me more 
I've never known this inevitable 
You're the first to make out whenever we are two 
I don't know who I'd be if I didn't know you 
You're so provocative, I'm so conservative 
You're so adventurous, I'm so very cautious, combined 
You think we would and we do, but we do, but we do, but we do 
Favouritism ain't my thing but 
In this situation I'll be glad
Favouritism ain't my thing but
I'll be glad to make an exception
You're set in stone and I never give in 
I think you're stubborn 'cept you're always softening 
You say I'm selfish, I agree with you on that
I think you're giving off way too much in fact 
I say we've only known each other one year 
You say, "Pff, I've known you longer my dear"
You like to be so close, I like to be alone 
I like to sit on chairs and you prefer the floor 
Walking with each other, think we'll never match at all, but we do
