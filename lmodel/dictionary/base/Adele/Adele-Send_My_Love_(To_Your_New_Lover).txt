<song artist="Adele" title="Send_My_Love_(To_Your_New_Lover)">
(Just the guitar pick)
This was all you
None of it me
You put your hands all 
Over my body and told me
Mmm... you told me you were ready
For the big one
For the big jump
I'd be your last love 
Everlasting you and me
Mmm... that was what you told me
I'm giving you up
I've forgiven it all
You set me free
Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go 
Of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more
Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go 
Of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more
Oh...
I was too strong
You were trembling
You couldn't handle
The hot heat rising 
(Rising)
Mmm... baby, I'm so rising
I was running
You were walking
You couldn't keep up
You were falling down
(Down)
Mmm... there's only one way down
I'm giving you up
I've forgiven it all
You set me free, oh...
Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go 
Of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more
Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go 
Of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more
Oh...
If you're ready
If you're ready
If you're ready
I am ready
If you're ready
If you're ready
We both know we ain't kids no more
Oh...
No, we ain't kids no more
I'm giving you up
I've forgiven it all
You set me free
Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go 
Of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more
Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go 
Of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more
Oh...
If you're ready
If you're ready
(Send my love to your new lover)
If you're ready
Are you ready? 
(Treat her better)
We've gotta let go 
Of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more
(Oh...)
If you're ready
If you're ready
(Send my love to your new lover)
If you're ready
Are you ready? 
(Treat her better)
We've gotta let go 
Of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more
Oh...
