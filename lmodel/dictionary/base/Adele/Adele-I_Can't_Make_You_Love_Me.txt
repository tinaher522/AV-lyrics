<song artist="Adele" title="I_Can't_Make_You_Love_Me">
Turn down the lights, turn down the bed
Turn down these voices inside my head
Lay down with me, tell me no lies
Just hold me closely, don't patronize
Don't patronize me
'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't
You can't make your heart feel something that it won't
Here in the dark, in these final hours
I will lay down my heart and I will feel the power
But you won't, no you won't
'Cause I can't make you love me when you don't
When you don't, yeah
I'll close my eyes,'cause then I won't see
The love you don't feel when you're home with me
Morning will come and I'll do what's right
Just give me 'til then to give up this fight
And I will give up this fight
'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't
You can't make your heart feel something that it won't
Here in the dark, in these final hours
I will lay down my heart and I will feel that power
But you won't, no you won't
'Cause I can't make you love me when you don't
When you don't, yeah
When you don't
