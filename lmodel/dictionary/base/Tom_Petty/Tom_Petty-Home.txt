<song artist="Tom_Petty" title="Home">
Left town in a hurry
Blackmailed the judge and the jury
Had his fingers into too many pies
You'll spill honey
You're gonna get flies
Can't begin to remember
You were so tore down by December
Sailed a dry river over the falls
Sometimes everything is nothing at all
And tonight I settle down easy
Beneath this big sky dome
Times are strange
and my mind could change
But honey your arms
Feel like home
I was born in October
Turned the hourglass over
My hair was dripping
My shirt was stained
Hit the ground running
Shackled and chained
And tonight I settle down easy
Beneath this big sky dome
Times are strange
and my mind could change
But honey your arms
Feel like home
Built a fallout shelter
But the storm began to melt her
Drug my bucket
Out into the rain
If I don't say nothin'
I can't complain
And tonight I settle down easy
Beneath this big sky dome
Times are strange
and my mind could change
But honey your arms
Feel like home
