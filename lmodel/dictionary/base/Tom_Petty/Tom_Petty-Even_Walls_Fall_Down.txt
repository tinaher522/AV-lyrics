<song artist="Tom_Petty" title="Even_Walls_Fall_Down">
Some days are diamonds
Some days are rocks
Some doors are open
Some roads are blocked
Sundowns are golden
Then fade away
But if I never do nothing
I'll get you back some day
'Cause you got a heart so big
It could crush this town
And I can't hold out forever
Even walls fall down
And all around your island
There's a barricade
It keeps out the danger
It holds in the pain
Sometimes you're happy
Sometimes you cry
Half of me is ocean
Half of me is sky
But you got a heart so big
It could crush this town
And I can't hold out forever
Even walls fall down
And some things are over
Some things go on
And part of me you carry
Part of me is gone
But you got a heart so big
It could crush this town
And I can't hold out forever
Even walls fall down
Baby, you got a heart so big
It could crush this town
And I can't hold out forever
Even walls fall down
They fall down
