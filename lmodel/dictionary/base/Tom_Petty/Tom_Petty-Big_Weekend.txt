<song artist="Tom_Petty" title="Big_Weekend">
There's some friends that I know living in this town
and I've come far to see them, gonna track em' down
They live in a brick house painted white and brown.
Left a tip for the maid and I packed up my guitar,
dropped my key on the counter, rented a car.
Gonna hook up with em' later and go hit the bars.
I need a big weekend
Kick up the dust
Yeah a big weekend
If you don't run, you rust.
Well I may shake your hand but I won't know your name
The joke in your language don't come out the same
There's times when I'm down and there's nothing to blame.
I need a big weekend
Kick up the dust
Yeah a big weekend
If you don't run, you rust.
I can work, I can travel, sleep anywhere,
cross every border with nothing to declare
You can look back babe, but it's best not to stare.
I need a big weekend
Kick up the dust
Yeah a big weekend
If you don't run, you rust.
