<song artist="Tom_Petty" title="I'll_Feel_A_Whole_Lot_Better">
The reason why, oh, I can't say
I have to let you go, babe, and right away
After what you did I can't stay on
And I'll probably feel a whole lot better
When you're gone
Baby, for a long time you had me believe
That your love was all mine
And that's the way it would be
But I didn't know that you were puttin' me on
And I'll probably feel a whole lot better
When you're gone
Oh, when you're gone
Now I gotta say that it's not like before
And I'm not gonna play your games anymore
After what you did I can't stay on
And I'll probably feel a whole lot better
When you're gone
Yeah, I'll probably feel a whole lot better
When you're gone
Oh, when you're gone
Oh, when you're gone
Oh, when you're gone
