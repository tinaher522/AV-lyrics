<song artist="Tom_Petty" title="I_Won't_Back_Down">
Well, I won't back down
No, I won't back down
You can stand me up at the gates of hell
But I won't back down
No, I'll stand my ground
Won't be turned around
And I'll keep this world from draggin' me down
Gonna stand my ground
And I won't back down
(I won't back down) Hey, baby
There ain't no easy way out
(I won't back down) Hey, I will stand my ground
And I won't back down
Well, I know what's right
I got just one life
In a world that keeps on pushin' me around
But I'll stand my ground
And I won't back down
(I won't back down) Hey, baby
There ain't no easy way out
(I won't back down) Hey, I will stand my ground
(I won't back down) And I won't back down
(I won't back down) Hey, baby
There ain't no easy way out
Hey, I won't back down
(I won't back down) Hey, baby
There ain't no easy way out
(I won't back down) Hey, I will stand my ground
(I won't back down) And I won't back down
(I won't back down) And I won't back down
