<song artist="Tom_Petty" title="Little_Egypt_(Ying_Yang)">
I went and bought myself a ticket and
I sat down in the very first row, wo wo.
They pulled the curtain but then when
They turned the spotlight way down low, wo wo,
Little Egypt came out strotting,
Wearing nothing but a button and a bow, wo wo,
Singing, "Yeah yeah! Yeah yeah! Yeah yeah! Yeah yeah.
She had a ruby on her tummy and
A diamond big as Texas on her toe, wo wo.
She let her hair down and
She did the hoochie koochie real slow, wo wo,
When she did her special number on a zebra skin,
I thought she'd stop the show, wo wo,
Singing, "Yeah yeah! Yeah yeah! Yeah yeah! Yeah yeah!".
She did a triple somersault and when she hit the ground,
She winked at the audience and then she turned around.
She had a picture of a cowboy tattooed on her spine,
Saying Phoenix, Arizona, nineteen forty-nine.
Yeah, but let me tell you people,
Little Egypt doesn't dance there anymore, wo wo.
She's too busy mopping and
A taking care of shopping at the store, wo wo.
Cause we got seven kids and
All day long they crawl around the floor, wo wo,
Singing, "Yeah yeah! Yeah yeah! Yeah yeah! Yeah yeah!"
