<song artist="Tom_Petty" title="The_Golden_Rose">
Well, The Golden Rose sailed with a broken man
Going South 
Got on board with a woman to lead him around
By the mouth 
And it's goodbye, Golden Rose 
Yeah, it's goodbye, Golden Rose 
Well, the captain who swears if he speaks at all 
Wears a gun 
Got a first maid who's never quite on the ball 
For his son 
And it's goodbye, Golden Rose 
Yeah, it's goodbye, Golden Rose 
Wish I was back in her arms again 
Wish I was holding her tight 
Wish I was back in her arms again 
Safe from the night 
She stood on the shore and she waved to me 
"Come back home" 
Many a-night I would think of her 
All alone 
And it's goodbye, Golden Rose 
Yeah, it's goodbye, Golden Rose
