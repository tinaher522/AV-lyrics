<song artist="Tom_Petty" title="Last_Dance_With_Mary_Jane">
She grew up in the Indiana town,
Had a good looking momma, who never was around.
But she grew up tall, and she grew up right,
With them Indiana boys, on a Indiana night.
Well she moved down here, at the age of 18,
She blew the boys away, was more than they seen.
I was introduced and we first started groovin,
She said I dig you baby but you got to keep movin on (Keep movin' on).
Last dance for Mary Jane, one more time to kill the pain...
I feel summer creeping in, and I'm tired of this town again...
I don't know, but i been told, 
Ya never slow down, ya never grow old.
Yer tired of screwing up, yer tired of goin down,
Tired of myself, tired of this town.
Oh my my, oh hell yes, honey put on that party dress.
Buy me a drink, sing me a song,
Take me as i come, cause i cant stay long.
There's pigeons now on market square,
She's standing in her underwear.
Looking down from the hotel room,
Night fall will be coming soon.
Oh my my, oh hell yes, you got to put on that party dress.
It was too cold to cry, when i woke up alone,
I hit the last number, i walked to the road.
