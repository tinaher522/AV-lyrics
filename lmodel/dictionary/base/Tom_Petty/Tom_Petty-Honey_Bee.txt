<song artist="Tom_Petty" title="Honey_Bee">
All right, here we go
It's a little number we call
Gimme some sugar, little honey natural bee
Come on now, give me some sugar
Give me some sugar, little honey bee
Don't be afraid, not gonna hurt you
I wouldn't hurt my little honey bee
That's right
Don't say a word 'bout what were doin'
Don't say nothin', little honey bee
Don't tell your mama, don't tell your sister
Don't tell your boyfriend, little honey bee
She like to call me king bee
She like to buzz 'round my tree
I call her honey bee
I'm a man in a trance
I'm a boy in short pants
When I see my honey bee
Well, I've got something to say
Buzz awhile
Twenty dollar
Look here now, peace in the valley
Peace in the valley with my honey bee
Don't say a word 'bout what were doin'
Don't say nothin', little honey bee
She give me her monkey hand
And a Rambler sedan
I'm the king of Milwaukee
Her juju beads are so nice
She kissed my third cousin twice
I'm the king of Pomona
Well, I've got something to say, yeah
That's right
Say what
Do it again
Yeah
