<song artist="Tom_Petty" title="Crawling_Back_To_You">
Waiting by the side of the road
For day to break so we could go
Down into Los Angeles
With dirty hands and worn out knees
I keep crawling back to you
I keep crawling back to you
The ranger came with burning eyes
The chambermaid awoke surprised
thought she'd seen the last of him
She shook her head and let him in
Hey baby, there's something in your eyes
Tryin' to say to me
That I'm gonna be alright if I believe in you
It's all I want to do
It was me and my sidekick
He was drunk and I was sick
We were caught up in a barroom fight
Till an Indian shot out the lights
I'm so tired of being tired
Sure as night will follow day
Most things I worry about
Never happen anyway
I keep crawling back to you
I keep crawling back to you
