<song artist="Tom_Petty" title="A_Mind_With_A_Heart_Of_Its_Own">
I remember her standing in the tall grass and cattails
Away from the windows at the end of the day
Watch the men from the landing 
With the tall hats and coat-tails
She'd never look different,
But something would change
A mind with a heart of its own
A mind with a heart of its own
Yeah, a mind with a heart of its own
Well the man out to end us had a hurricane business
He'd raise them from babies all by his self
But his teen-age accountant had become surrounded
He drank up the party and everyone left
A mind with a heart of its own
A mind with a heart of its own
Yeah, a mind with a heart of its own
Well I been to Brooker and I been to Micanopy
I been to St. Louis too, I been all around the world
I've been over to your house
And you've been over sometimes to my house
I've slept in your tree house
My middle name is Earl
A mind with a heart of its own
A mind with a heart of its own
Yeah, a mind with a heart of its own
A mind with a heart of its own
A mind with a heart of its own
Yeah, a mind with a heart of its own
