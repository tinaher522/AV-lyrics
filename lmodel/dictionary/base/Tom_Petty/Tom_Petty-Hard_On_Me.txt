<song artist="Tom_Petty" title="Hard_On_Me">
It's all I can do to keep that little girl smiling
And keep my faith alive
Takes all I got to hold on till tomorrow 
And you wanna make it hard
You wanna make it hard on me
Some other time, I'd be understanding
You were supposed to be
The friend that I needed when I was down
And now you wanna make it hard
Yeah, you wanna make it hard on me
Maybe if I try, I could turn the other cheek
Maybe, but how big do I have to be?
And you wanna make it hard
Yeah, you wanna make it hard on me
Maybe if I try, I could turn the other cheek
Maybe, but how big do I have to be?
I need someone to put their arm around me
Shelter me from all harm
Just as I find something to believe in
You wanna make it hard
You wanna make it hard on me
Yeah, you wanna make it hard
You wanna make it hard on me
