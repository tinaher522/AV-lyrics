<song artist="Tom_Petty" title="Wild_One">
Well the moon sank
As the wind blew
The street lights slowly died, They call you the wild one,said Stay away from her 
Said she could love no one if she tried
But then somethin I saw
In your eyes told me right away You were gonna have to be mine When the strangest feelin came over me down inside
No matter what it takes
I'd never get over how good it felt 
When you finally held me I would never regret 
Baby those few hours 
Will grow in my head, forever
Well its too bad, but I want you to know I understand. 
Yeah its been a long time but I don't mind, 
Yeah its alright I understand
Cause somethin I saw in your eyes told me right away 
You were gonna have to be mine 
When the strangest feeling came over me down inside 
I knew right away I'll never get over 
How good it felt 
When you finally kissed me 
I'll never regret, 
Baby those few hours 
Will grow in my head, forever... and ever
