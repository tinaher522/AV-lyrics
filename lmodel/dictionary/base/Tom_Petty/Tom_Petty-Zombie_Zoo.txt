<song artist="Tom_Petty" title="Zombie_Zoo">
All down the street they're standing in line
With white lipstick and one thing on their mind
Hey, little freak with the lunch pail purse
Underneath the paint you're just a little girl
Dancin' at the Zombie Zoo
Dancin' at the Zombie Zoo
Painted in a corner and all you wanna do is
Dance down at the Zombie Zoo
Cute little drop out
How come you pack a rod
Is your mother in a clinic
Has your father got no job
Sometimes you're so impulsive
You shaved off all your hair
You look like Boris Karloff
And you don't even care
You're dancin' at the Zombie Zoo
Dancin' at the Zombie Zoo
Painted in a corner and all you wanna do is
Dance down at the Zombie Zoo
She disappears at sunrise
I wonder where she goes until the night
Comes fallin' down again
You show up with your friends half alive
Dancin' at the Zombie Zoo
Dancin' at the Zombie Zoo
Well, you can make a big impression
Or go through life unseen
You might wind up restricted
And over seventeen
It's so hard to be careful
So easy to be led
Somewhere beyond the pavement
You'll find the living dead
Dancin' at the Zombie Zoo
Dancin' at the Zombie Zoo
Painted in a corner and all she wants do is
Dance down at the Zombie Zoo
She disappears at sunrise
I don't know where she goes until the night
Comes falling down again
She shows up with her friends half alive
Dancin' at the Zombie Zoo
Dancin' at the Zombie Zoo
Painted in a corner and all you want to do is
Dance down at the Zombie Zoo
Yeah, dance down at the Zombie Zoo
Yeah, get down at the Zombie Zoo
