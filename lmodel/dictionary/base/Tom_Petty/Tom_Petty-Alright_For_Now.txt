<song artist="Tom_Petty" title="Alright_For_Now">
Goodnight, baby, sleep tight my love
May God watch over you from above
Tomorrow I'm workin', what would I do
I'd be lost and lonely if not for you
So close your eyes
We're alright for now
I've spent my life travelling, I've spent my life free
I could not repay all you've done for me
So sleep tight, baby, unfurrow your brow
And know I love you, we're alright for now
We're alright for now
