<song artist="Tom_Petty" title="Break_Down">
It's all right if you love me
It's all right if you don't
I'm not afraid of you running away, honey
I get the feeling you won't
There's is no sense in pretending
Your eyes give you away
Something inside you is feeling like I do
We've said all there is to say
Baby, break down
Go ahead and give it to me
Break down, honey
Take me through the night
Break down
It's standing there
Can't you see?
Break down
It's all right
It's all right
It's all right
Break down
Go ahead and give it to me
Break down, honey
Take me through the night
Break down
It's standing there
Can't you see?
Break down
It's all right
It's all right
It's all right
