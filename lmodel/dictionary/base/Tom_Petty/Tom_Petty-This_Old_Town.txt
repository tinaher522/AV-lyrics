<song artist="Tom_Petty" title="This_Old_Town">
Living free is gaining on me
Can't keep ahead of my dreams
My relief turned out a thief
Smooth as rocks in the stream
This old town is a sad affair
You be glad you're not there
It ties your hands, it spikes your drink
I'd say more, but I can't think
Lazy Jim took a bottle with him
Tried to flag down a train
Left a note, couldn't read what he wrote
A light came on in my brain
This old town is a sad affair
You be glad you're not there
It ties your hands, it spikes your drink
I'd say more, but I can't think
The hills are gold
Mornings are cold
Don't know a soul on the street
I keep to myself like everyone else
Nobody says much to me
Go to bed, fight thoughts in my head
In the time between wake and sleep
Rats to kill, contracts to fill
It's on ice, but it won't keep
This old town is a sad affair
You be glad you're not there
It ties your hands, it spikes your drink
I'd say more, but I can't think
This old town is a sad affair
You be glad you're not there
It ties your hands, it spikes your drink
I'd say more, but I can't think
