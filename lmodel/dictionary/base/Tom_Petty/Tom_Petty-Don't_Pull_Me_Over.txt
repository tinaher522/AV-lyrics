<song artist="Tom_Petty" title="Don't_Pull_Me_Over">
Don't pull me over mister policeman*
Don't pull me over mister policeman
What I've got to do won't hurt anyone
Where I've got to go won't hurt anyone
Don't pull me over
I've got mouths to feed
Don't pull me over
They depend on me
What I've got to say won't hurt anyone
What I've got to do won't hurt anyone
When the moonlight turns to blue light
Makes me so afraid
So let me go
Leave me 'lone
'til I'm home and safe
Don't pull me over let me pass on by
Don't pull me over
Should be legalized
Don't pull me over mister policeman
Don't pull me over mister policeman
Please, please mister policeman
Please, please mister policeman
