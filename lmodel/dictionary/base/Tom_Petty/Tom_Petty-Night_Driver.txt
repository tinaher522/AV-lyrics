<song artist="Tom_Petty" title="Night_Driver">
There's a shadow on the moon tonight
I swear I see your face up there with the satellites
Looking down from outerspace
Me, I'm drifting home again
Headlights in my eyes
Fighting sleep with windows down
Worn out from long goodbye's.
Night driver drifting home again
Night driver drifting home again
You offered up no history when you blew into town
You remain a mystery, no information found
I speed dial the judgment call
The near miss hits the ground
The new king hides behind the throne refusing to be crowned.
Night driver drifting home again
Night driver drifting home again
High tide rumbles, PCH 
My tires losing track
Helicopter circling, wiping overhead
Now I sit and count the days and try to fill my time
There's a shadow on the moon tonight
The dollar gets a dime.
Night driver drifting home again
Night driver drifting home again
Home again
