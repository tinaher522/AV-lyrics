<song artist="Tom_Petty" title="Lost">
Big town, big money
Id do anything just to have you honey
By my side where you were
I wouldn't be so lost and lonely
These dreams were my own my bitter passion
Now they are nightmares without much direction
Money and things couldn't heal my heart
I had to have you there holding my hand with me til the bitter end
Big Town Big money where do we all go when we are lost and hungry?
Big Town Big money, its all a big game are we lost in this country?
There are so many things I would tell you now, how I made big decisions How I came to know how

That nothing can replace you nothing can be what you are to me
These dreams are gone now and you are too, 
I wonder who is laughing out loud watching us spinning in circles with no where to go
And will we ever laugh again with our friends?
Big Town Big money, where did you go when I was lost and hungry?
Big Town Big money, its not all the same, can we get together again?
And make sure you tell them they are lost too because nothing can mend the heart like a long lost friend.
