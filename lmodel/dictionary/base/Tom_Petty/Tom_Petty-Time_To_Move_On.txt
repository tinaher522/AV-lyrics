<song artist="Tom_Petty" title="Time_To_Move_On">
It's time to move on, it's time to get going
What lies ahead, I have no way of knowing
But under my feet, baby, grass is growing
It's time to move on, time to get going
Broken skyline
Movin' through the airport
She's an honest defector
Conscientious objector
Now her own protector
A broken skyline
Which way to love land?
Which way to something better?
Which way to forgiveness?
Which way do I go?
Yeah, it's time to move on, time to get going
What lies ahead, I have no way of knowing
But under my feet, baby, grass is growing
It's time to move on, time to get going
Sometime later
Getting the words wrong
Wasting the meaning
and losing the rhyme
Nauseous adrenalin
Like breakin' up a dogfight
Like a deer in the headlights
Frozen in real time
I'm losing my mind
Yeah, it's time to move on, time to get going
What lies ahead, I have no way of knowing
But under my feet, baby, grass is growing 
It's time to move on, it's time to get going
Yeah, it's time to move on, time to get going
What lies ahead, I have no way of knowing
But under my feet, baby, grass is growing 
It's time to move on, it's time to get going
Yeah, it's time to move on, it's time to get going.
