<song artist="Tom_Petty" title="Flirting_With_Time">
A coyote ran across the road
on the move without a home.
A flash of light reminded me of you.
This could well be your last stand.
Hold the sunlight in your hand.
Spread your fingers, feel the sand fall through.
I've done all I can do. Now it's up to you.
You're flirting with time baby
Flirting with time, but maybe,
Time baby, is catching up with you.
Shadowmen talk a real good game.
Every punchline has your name.
You cried out and no one came to you.
I've done all I can do. Now it's up to you.
You're flirting with time baby
Flirting with time, but maybe,
Time baby, is catching up with you.
Should be more to learn from this.
Can't say I know what it is.
No difference tween a hit or miss,
it's true.
I've done all I can do. Now it's up to you.
You're flirting with time baby
Flirting with time, but maybe,
Time baby, is catching up with you.
