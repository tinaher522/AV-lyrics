<song artist="Tom_Petty" title="Turn_This_Car_Around">
Save a dream for me
Words hang in the air
Her demons take the dare
Above the lonely feather circles to the ground
The house don't make a sound
Turn this car around (x2)
I'm goin back
Green and gray and auburn
Gliding down the sky
The devil winks an eye
A figure in the doorway
Shouldering the blame
This ain't without a name
Turn this car around (x2)
I'm goin back (x2)
Yeah!
Hey!
The king and queen are loaded
Falling off to sleep
The ground begins to creep
Rockets in the tail lights
Red burns into night
Rolling out of sight
Turn this car around (x2)
I'm goin back 
Turn this car around (x2)
I'm goin back
