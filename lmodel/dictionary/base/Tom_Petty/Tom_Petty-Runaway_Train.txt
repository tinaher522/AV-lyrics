<song artist="Tom_Petty" title="Runaway_Train">
Call you up in the middle of the night
Like a fire flower miles away
You were there like a blow torch burnin'
I was a key that could use a little turnin'
So tired that I couldn't even sleep
So many secrets I couldn't keep
Promised myself I wouldn't weep
One more promise I couldn't keep
It seems no one can help me now
I'm in too deep there's no way out
This time I have really let myself pull stray
Runaway train never goin' back
Wrong way on a one way track
Seems like I should be getting somewhere
Somehow I'm neither here nor there
Can you help me remember how to smile
Make it somehow seem all worth while
How on earth did I get so jaded
Last mystery seemed so naked
I can go where no one else can go
I know what no one else has known
Here I am just a drowning in the brain
With a ticket for a runaway train
Everything seems judged inside
Day and night earth and sky
Somehow I just don't believe it
Runaway train never goin' back
Wrong way on a one way track
Seems like I should be getting somewhere
Somehow I'm neither here nor there
Want a ticket for a runaway train?
Like a madman laughin' at the rain
A little out of touch little in the brain
It's just easier to deal with the pain
Runaway train never goin' back
Wrong way on a one way track
Seems like I should be getting somewhere
Somehow I'm neither here nor there
Runaway train never comin' back
Runaway train tearin' up the track
Runaway train burnin' in my veins
Run away but it always seems the same
