<song artist="Tom_Petty" title="Jack">
You say what you want to Jack, I'm gonna get my baby back.
Trouble came right away, now you say she's gone to stay.
Cough it up, hit the street, left without a word to me.
Oh Oh, you don't know, how that girl could touch my soul.
You say what you want to Jack, I'm gonna get my baby back.
Suddenly you know my name, say there's only me to blame.
It's gonna rain, its gonna shine, gotta stay between the lines.
Rollin down a lonely road, you say I should let it go.
Wish you would come on down, if you need I'll come around.
You say what you want to Jack, I'm gonna get my baby back.
Used to have a son named Joe, where he gone to I don't know.
Maybe down in Mexico, livin off of Pattie's door.
If you give me half a chance, I will make her sing and dance.
I'm gonna give her all my soul, I'm gonna play her Rock'n Roll.
You say what you want to Jack, I'm gonna get my baby back.
You say what you want to jack, I'm gonna get my baby back.
