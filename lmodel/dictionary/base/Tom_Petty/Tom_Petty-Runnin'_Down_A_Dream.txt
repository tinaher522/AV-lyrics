<song artist="Tom_Petty" title="Runnin'_Down_A_Dream">
It was a beautiful day, the sun beat down
I had the radio on, I was driving
Trees went by, me and Del were singing
'Little Runaway', I was flyin'
Yeah, runnin' down a dream
It never would come to me
Working on a mystery
Going wherever it leads
Runnin' down a dream
I felt so good, like anything was possible
Hit cruise control and rubbed my eyes
The last three days the rain was unstoppable
It was always cold, no sunshine
Yeah, runnin' down a dream
It never would come to me
Working on a mystery
Going wherever it leads
Runnin' down a dream
(Woo-hoo, woo-hoo, woo-hoo)
(Woo-hoo, woo-hoo, woo-hoo)
I rolled on, the sky grew dark
I put the pedal down to make some time
There's something good waiting down this road
I'm picking up whatever is mine
I'm runnin' down a dream
It never would come to me
Working on a mystery
Going wherever it leads
Runnin' down a dream
Yeah, I'm runnin' down a dream
It never would come to me
Working on a mystery
Going wherever it leads
I'm runnin' down a dream
(Woo-hoo, woo-hoo, woo-hoo)
(Woo-hoo, woo-hoo, woo-hoo)
(Woo-hoo, woo-hoo, woo-hoo)
(Woo-hoo, woo-hoo, woo-hoo)
(Woo-hoo, woo-hoo, woo-hoo)
(Woo-hoo, woo-hoo, woo-hoo)
(Woo-hoo, woo-hoo, woo-hoo)
(Woo-hoo, woo-hoo, woo-hoo)
