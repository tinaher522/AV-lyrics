<song artist="Tom_Petty" title="Damaged_By_Love">
She don't care about time
Time gets in her way
Fades into the wind
Days roll into days
She's got nothing to hide
And she hides it so well
Keeps broken dreams
To fix up and sell
Damaged by love, damaged by love
So young, and damaged by love
There's rain on the road
And the faithful have gone
In a crowd all alone
Walking 'round in a song
Damaged by love, damaged by love
So young, and damaged by love
Eyes down at my door
And she holds out her hand
I love you so deep
But you can't understand
Damaged by love, damaged by love
So young, and damaged by love
So young, and damaged by love
