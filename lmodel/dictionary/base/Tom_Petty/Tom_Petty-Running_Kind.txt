<song artist="Tom_Petty" title="Running_Kind">
I was born the runnin' kind
With leavin' always on my mind
Home was never home to me
At anytime
Every front door found me hopin'
I would find the back door open
There just had to be an exit
For the runnin' kind
Within me there's a prison
Surroundin' me alone
As real as any dungeon
With its walls of stone
I know runnin's not the answer
Though runnin's been my nature
And a thing in me that keeps me movin' on
I was born the runnin' kind
With leavin' always on my mind
Home was never home to me
At anytime
Every front door found me hopin'
I would find the back door open
There just had to be an exit
For the runnin' kind
I was born the runnin' kind
With leavin' always on my mind
Home was never home to me
At anytime
Every front door found me hopin'
I would find the back door open
There just had to be an exit
For the runnin' kind
