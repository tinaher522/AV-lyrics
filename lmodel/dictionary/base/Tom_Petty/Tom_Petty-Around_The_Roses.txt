<song artist="Tom_Petty" title="Around_The_Roses">
Got a feeling I'm wrong.
Got a feeling the joke's on me.
Thought that you were my friend.
Around the roses again. Around the roses again.
Don't stare into the sun.
I'm left here with a smoking gun.
Right back where I've been.
Around the roses again. Around the roses again.
CHORUS:

Here we go around again. 
Never lose but don't quite win.
All I want is to believe in you.
(repeat chorus)
Got a feeling she's gone.
Like my faith has been over run.
Ain't no truth to defend.
Around the roses again. Around the roses again.
Around the roses again.
Around the roses again.
