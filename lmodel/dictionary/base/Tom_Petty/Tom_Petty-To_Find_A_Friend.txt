<song artist="Tom_Petty" title="To_Find_A_Friend">
1, 2, 3, 4
In the middle of his life
He left his wife
And ran off to be bad
Boy, it was sad
But he bought a new car
Found a new bar
And went under another name
Created a whole new game
And the days went by like paper in the wind
Everything changed then changed again
It's hard to find a friend
It's hard to find a friend
Meanwhile then
His wife's boyfriend moved in and
Took over the house
Everybody was quiet as a mouse
And it changed their lives
Changed their plans
Slowly they grew apart
Boy, it woulda broke your heart
And the days went by like paper in the wind
Everything changed then changed again
It's hard to find a friend
It's hard to find a friend
And the days went by like paper in the wind
Everything changed then changed again
It's hard to find a friend
It's hard to find a friend
And the days went by like paper in the wind
Everything changed then changed again
It's hard to find a friend
It's hard to find a friend
