<song artist="Tom_Petty" title="Ankle_Deep">
Well, they raised that horse to be a jumper
He was owned by a mid-west bible thumper
His preacher was a Louisiana drummer
Took all winter to get through the summer
The fieldhand hit the switch and stumbled
Outside the big engine roared and rumbled
The stolen horse spooked and tumbled
She didn't speak for a week, just kinda mumbled
Ankle deep in love
Ankle deep in love
Ankle deep in love
Ankle deep in love
He was caught up in a lie he half believed
Found her hiding high in the family tree
Washed his hands and put her cross his knee
She said, "Daddy, you been a mother to me"
Ankle deep in love
Ankle deep in love
Ankle deep in love
Ankle deep in love
