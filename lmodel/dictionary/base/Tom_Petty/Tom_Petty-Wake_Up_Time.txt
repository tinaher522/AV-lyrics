<song artist="Tom_Petty" title="Wake_Up_Time">
You follow your feelings
You follow your dreams
You follow the leader
Into the trees
And what's in there waiting
Neither one of us knows
You gotta keep one eye open
The further you go
You never dreamed you'd go down on one knee, but now
Who could've seen you'd be so hard to please somehow?
You feel like a poor boy
A long way from home
You're just a poor boy 
A long way from home
And it's wake-up time
Time to open up your eyes
And rise
And shine
You spend your life dreaming 
Running round in a trance
You hang out forever
And still miss the dance
And if you get lucky 
You might find someone
To help you get over
The pain that will come
Yeah, you were so cool back in high school, what happened?
You were so sure not to have your spirits down
But you're just a poor boy
Alone in this world
You're just a poor boy
Alone in this world
And it's wake-up time
Time to open up your eyes
And rise
And shine
Well, they think it's lucky
A boy finds a girl
To help him to shoulder
The pain in this world
And if you follow your feelings
You follow your dreams
You might find the forest
There in the trees
Yeah, you'll be all right, it's just gonna take time, and now
Who could have seen you'd be so hard to please somehow?
You're just a poor boy 
A long way from home
You're just a poor boy
A long way from home
And it's wake-up time
Time to open up your eyes
And rise
And shine
'Cause it's wake-up time
Time to open up your eyes
And rise
And shine
