<song artist="Tom_Petty" title="Waiting_(Is_The_Hardest_Part)">
Oh baby, don't it feel like heaven right now
Don't it feel like something from a dream
Yeah, I've never known nothing quite like this
Don't it feel like tonight might never be again
Baby, we know better than to try and pretend
No one coulda ever told me 'bout this
I said, yeah, yeah
The waiting is the hardest part
Every day you see one more card
You take it on faith, you take it to the heart
The waiting is the hardest part
Well, yeah, I might have chased a couple women around
All it ever got me was down
Then there were those that made me feel good
But never as good as I'm feeling right now
Baby, you're the only one that's ever known how
To make me wanna laugh like I wanna laugh now
I said, yeah, yeah
The waiting is the hardest part
Every day you get one more yard
You take it on faith, you take it to the heart
The waiting is the hardest part
Oh, don't let it kill you, baby, don't let it get to you
Don't let it kill you, baby, don't let it get to you
I'll be your bleedin' heart, I'll be your cryin' fool
Don't let this go too far, don't let it get to you
