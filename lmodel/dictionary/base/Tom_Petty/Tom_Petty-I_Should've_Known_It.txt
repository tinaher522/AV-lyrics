<song artist="Tom_Petty" title="I_Should've_Known_It">
I should've known it,  I should've seen.
Leave it to you, to treat me mean.
Every promise, was just a run around.
I should've known it, yeah your gonna let me down.
Well it's over now you see,
It's the last time your gonna hurt me.
I should've known it, hard to believe.
It was all right there, in front of me.
Sold down the river, left for dead.
Now your puttin' ideas, in another man's head.
But it's over now you see,
It's the last time your gonna hurt me.
(solo)
Thanks for nuthin'. Yeah thanks a lot.
Go ahead baby, take all I got.
And it's over now you see.
It's the last time your gonna hurt me.
(solo)
It's the last time your gonna hurt me.
