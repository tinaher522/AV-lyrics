<song artist="Tom_Petty" title="Depending_On_You">
I ain't ever gonna let you down
All you gotta do is trust me
I would never make you some clown
Baby, why won't you trust me
You give up so easily
I don't know why you can't see
I'm depending on you
Don't let me down
I'm depending on you
Baby, if you can't change the world
Maybe you should just change yourself
You used to be such a sweet young girl
Why you wanna be someone else
You give up so easily
I don't know why you can't see
I'm depending on you
Is it too late now
I'm depending on you
You give up so easily
I don't know why you can't see
I'm depending on you
Don't let me down
I'm depending on you
Yeah, I'm depending on you
Is it too late now
I'm depending on you
Yeah, I'm depending on you
I'm depending on you
Is it too late now
I'm depending on you
