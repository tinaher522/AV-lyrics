<song artist="The_Neighbourhood" title="Leaving_Tonight">
You fooled me from the start,
When you let me start to love you,
It's like a bunch of broken picture frames,
But 
The photo still remains, the same,
I thought it'd be easy to run,
But my legs are broken.
All alone,
All we know,
Is haunting me,
Making it harder to breathe.
I'm leaving tonight,
I'm leaving tonight,
I'm leaving tonight,
I'm leaving tonight, 
I'm leaving tonight,
I'll be home in the morning.
I saw it from a far,
But my eyes have always fooled me
It looked to me like all the sidewalks started walking.
I swear to god the voices wouldn't shut up,
I figured it all to be love,
But this isn't lovely.
