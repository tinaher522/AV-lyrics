<song artist="The_Neighbourhood" title="Everybody's_Watching_Me_(Uh_Oh)">
I told you I would tell you
Everything you wanna know
You want me to tell you now
You pressured me to shout it
Need to hear about it
To think that I would count you out
I let you find it on your own
Then I found myself alone
Uh oh, where can I go?
Everybody's watching me
Uh oh, where can I go?
Everybody's watching me
Ooh ooh, what can I do
If you're not here to tell you?
Uh oh, where can I go?
Everybody's watching me
I go through all the trouble
Of keeping it within my walls
I try to be as subtle as I can
Assume that nothing needs me
All I've done defeats me
It looks like you were right again
And again
I let you find it on your own
Then I found myself alone
Uh oh, where can I go?
Everybody's watching me
Uh oh, where can I go?
Everybody's watching me
Ooh ooh, what can I do
If you're not here to tell you?
Uh oh, where can I go?
Everybody's watching me
The more I want in, the more I want in
The less I know, the less I know
But I forgot it, I forgot it
I'll be alone, I'll be alone
I'll be alone, I'll be alone
With everybody watching me
Uh oh, where can I go?
Everybody's watching me
Uh oh, where can I go?
Everybody's watching me
Ooh ooh, what can I do
If you're not here to tell you?
Uh oh, where can I go?
Everybody's watching me
They're watching me
They're watching me, me, me
They're watching me, me, me
They're watching me, me, me
Everybody's watching me
