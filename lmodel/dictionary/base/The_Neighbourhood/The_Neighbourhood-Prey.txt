<song artist="The_Neighbourhood" title="Prey">
As long as you know this
I'm hoping that you keep your heart open
I'll keep mine open too
If you don't ask, I won't tell
Just know that, just know that
It all hurts, it all hurts just the same
Something is wrong, I can't explain
Everything changed when the birds came
You'll never know one thing I do
If it gets you too early
We need to fly ourselves
Before someone else tells us how
Something is wrong, I feel like preying
I feel like preying
As long as you know this
I'm hoping that you keep your heart open
I'll keep mine open too
So... So I'll gotta take it inside till it works up my mind
And you... You'll just keep it inside
Probably tell me that you're allright
Something is wrong, I can't explain
Everything changed when the birds came
You'll never know one thing I do
If it gets you too early
We need to fly ourselves
Before someone else tells us how
Something is wrong, I feel like preying
I feel like preying
If I run
If run away, I'll never know what you want
And if you go then I'll never grow
I might die
If you run, I just shouldn't let you fly
Something is wrong, I can't explain
You know what I mean, don't you?
Something I saw, something I did that made me like this
Could you help me?
We need to fly ourselves
Before someone else tells us how
Something is wrong, I feel like preying
I feel like preying
So... So I'll gotta take it inside till it works up my mind
And you... You'll just keep it inside
Probably tell me that you're allright
I don't wanna fight... I don't wanna fight
