<song artist="The_Neighbourhood" title="No_Grey">
Money, money, money
First things first
I don't wanna be forgotten
Even worse
I don't wanna be alone
But if it all stops today
I'll probably say
I didn't waste my minutes
When I'm finished
Brand new faith
And I'm ready for the camera's mention
And all I pay
And my money and my damn attention
Didn't get me the deal
It got me to feel
How you would hear my sentence
When I'm finished
You can do it for the money, money, money
But the money makes 'em all the same
Everything's sunny, sunny, sunny, sunny
But the sunshine fades away
Everything's black (Everything's black)
And white (And white)
No grey (There's no grey)
(There's no grey)
Pitch black frames
You can't see me when I wear my lenses
And all they say
Is I'm fake and I don't get offended
And when push comes to shove
I'll show enough
I didn't need to listen
When I'm finished
You're insane
What you said when I'd explained the game plan
Nothing's changed
Except a little more change in my hand
Now I don't mean to brag
Life was in fact
Non-witness shows of women
And it's not finished
You can do it for the money, money, money
But the money makes 'em all the same
Everything's sunny, sunny, sunny, sunny
But the sunshine fades away
Everything's black (Everything's black)
And white (And white)
No grey (There's no grey)
(There's no grey)
It ended up with gold, but it started as a dream
If I get cold, put some honey in my tea
I used to be broke, now there's money in my jeans
I was broke, now there's money in my jeans, mmmm
I was broke, now there's money in my...
I was broke, now there's money in my jeans
You can do it for the money, money, money
But the money makes 'em all the same
Everything's sunny, sunny, sunny, sunny
But the sunshine fades away
Everything's black (Everything's black)
And white (And white)
No grey (There's no grey)
(There's no grey)
Everything's black
And white
No grey
