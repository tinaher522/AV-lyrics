<song artist="The_Neighbourhood" title="Baby_Came_Home_2_-_Valentines">
She was five foot four
With some money on the floor
And box that's hidden under her bed
I was only twenty two
With a pocket full of truth
But I gave her everything that I had
We were born and raised in the Golden State
Mommy's gone and daddy's doing his best
I was brought up great living Section 8
Social security's paying the rent
The landlord called, she said you gotta go
Little one you just lost your
She was five foot four
Getting money on tour
But her socks were at the end of my bed
Got our names tattooed on each other
Just to prove to each other
That we'd do what we said
Only took a few days
'Til our minds were made up
And we thought we should try it again
I was only 17 when we first tried things
When she first made me feel like a man
Who am I gonna call?
Who's gonna catch me when I-
Who's the one you're sleeping with?
Don't you sit in front of me
And wait for me to talk
You can call me up
Phone works two ways, you know
This time baby
And I think that I'll be just fine
I wish I could say the same for you
I, yeah I do
