<song artist="The_Neighbourhood" title="Float">
Imagine breathing in
Imagine leaving all your air behind
What matters in the end
A matter of opinion 'til you find out
Life can only mean hardly anything
All I'll ever be is partly settled in
To show you how to swim, then they throw you in the deep end
I've been learning since, but it doesn't mean I float
I won't float, no, no, no, no, oh, float
I had a funny sleep, 
I didn't have a dream 
because I don't believe in them
Life can only mean hardly anything
All I'll ever be is partly settled in
To show you how to swim, then they throw you in the deep end
I've been learning since, but it doesn't mean I float
I won't float, no, no, no, no, oh, float
Float away, float away, then come right back to me
Float away, float away, then come right back to me
To show you how to swim, then they throw you in the deep end
I've been learning since, but it doesn't mean I float
I won't float, no, no, no, no, oh, float
What if I, what if I don't float?
What if I don't float?
I think I'll float, I'll float
I'll float away
