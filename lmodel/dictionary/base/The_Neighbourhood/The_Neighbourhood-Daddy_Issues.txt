<song artist="The_Neighbourhood" title="Daddy_Issues">
Take you like a drug
Taste you on my tongue
Ask me what I'm thinking about
I'll tell you that I'm thinking about
Whatever your thinking about
Ask me something that I won't forget
But you might have to tell me again
It's crazy what you do for fame
Go ahead and cry little girl
Nobody does it like you do
I know how much it matters to you
I know that you got daddy issues
If you were my little girl
I'd do whatever I could do
I love it when I'm high with you
I love that you got daddy issues
And I do too
I try to write your name in the rain
But the rain never came
So I made this song
The shame, always comes at the worst time
Ask me what I'm thinking about
I'll tell you that i'm thinking about
Whatever you're thinking about
So what are you thinking that I'm running from?
Tell me something you won't forget
But you might have to tell me again
Its crazy what you do for fame
Go ahead and cry little girl
Nobody does it like you do
I know how much it matters to you
I know that you got daddy issues
And If you were my little girl
I'd do whatever I could do
I love it when I'm high with you
I love that you got daddy issues
And I do too
I keep on trying to let you go
Not even let you know
How I'm getting on
I wasn't sad when you left at first
But now that you did it hurts
This time I gotta know
Where did my daddy go?
I'm not entirely here
Half of me has disappeared
Go ahead and cry little boy
You know that your daddy did too
You know you gotta let it out soon
Gotta let it out soon
Let it out soon
Go ahead and cry little girl
Nobody does it like you do
I know how much it matters to you
I know that you got daddy issues
And If you were my little girl
I'd do whatever I could do
I love it when I'm high with you
I love that you got daddy issues
And I do too
