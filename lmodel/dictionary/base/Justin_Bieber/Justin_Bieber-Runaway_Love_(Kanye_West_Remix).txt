Yo Ye whattup
Raekwon
You got stacks like the International House of Pancakes
All alone, ready to phone me and your hand shakes
Palms is wet, a don's regret
Never to walk miles for love, I sit in the starter's deck
It just happened I was floating, you seen the captain?
Blinked at me then I threw him my thinking cap
Take her, then we could slide to Jamaica
Shop for like a year or two, stop in Diego
It's obvious, I want to see who your mami is
We just friends so she can't Clyde, Bonnie this
Fly walls, dining in fly halls
Come to the master suite, leave every piece in the master hall
All my money tied in knots
Stand over there, that's why I make it happen on blocks
Brazil cut sweater, patent leather
Playing the field, trying to outslick Baretta
Justin Bieber
You see my baby over here
Hit the road
Where she's going that's what nobody knows
I need to find her before another man does
I wouldn't want him to steal my love
I'm just trying to be cool, cool, cool
(trying to be cool)
What you expect me to do? (oh yeah)
I'm just trying to find, find, find
The sweet love of mine
I'm running out of time
Where is my runaway love?
Searching low and high
Know that I'm not giving up
I'd give it all up for her
But it'll never be enough
I won't stop until I find
My runaway love
Kanye West
Last name West and my teeth diamonds
She said "Yo what's your occupation, crazy rhyming?"
Listen to Wu-Tang, trying suits on
Accoutrements is Grey Poupon
Stunting in a high top Louis', shorts is the Coogis
Open up the door when you take her to the movies
When you meet the parents, you tell De Niro
Her boyfriend a zero, she need to cut the weirdo
Next show they gotta up the zeros
Nobody rocking like this 16 years old
The hard drums and the Wally's something that caught me
I'm telling you what Wu-Tang taught me
The young youth, rocking the gold tooth
Pull up in a drop top, old school bumping to Cash Rules
No question we the reason why the summer's blazing
Then say, "You looking good fly coloured Asian"
Raw I give it to you, no trivia
She used to roll with my G-Unit like Olivia
Until she caught me getting numbers and hugs
I guess that's the day she became a runaway love, sweet love of mine
Justin Bieber
I'm running out of time
Where is my runaway love?
Searching low and high
Know that I'm not giving up
I'd give it all up for her
But it'll never be enough
I won't stop until I find
My runaway love
Why can't I find (why can't I find) you love of mine?
When you're standing in front of my face?
Oh I (oh I) I must be blind
How did I let you get away? (Yeah)
Raekwon
Leave it up to the most high, sitting in a ghost fly
Chilling with two of my brothers
We both live on deck grabbing 'em on set
This is how we roll in the business, she a go I'mma go get
Take that queen or shorty up
We can live it up every month baby girl, just call me up
Waking up resting in cold sweats
Thinking of this b*tch, the videotapes, even the stress
My mind is a terrible thing to waste
No love lost, I know I'm going crazy, I can't floss
Me, my lady left my homies it's all baloney
Just like rocking the old Pony's
So when I'm chilling, I'm just lost no more feeling
I need my honey in my life get that feel me
Take your time, readjust and ya you shine
My runaway love didn't mind, come on
Justin Bieber
I'm running out of time
Where is my runaway love?
Searching low and high
Know that I'm not giving up
I'd give it all up for her
But it'll never be enough
I won't stop until I find
My runaway love
I'm running out of time
Where is my runaway love?
Searching low and high
Know that I'm not giving up
I'd give it all up for her
But it'll never be enough
I won't stop until I find
My runaway love
Oh oh oh
Yeah
Oh baby
