One less lonely girl
One less lonely girl
One less lonely girl
How many "I told you's" and "start over's" and shoulders have you cried on before?
How many promises? Be honest, girl
How many tears you let hit the floor?
How many bags you packed
Just to take them back?
Tell me that how many "either or's"?
But no more if you let me inside of your world
There'll be one less lonely girl
Oh no, saw so many pretty faces
Now all I see is you
Oh no, don't need these other pretty faces
'Cause when you're mine, in the world
There's gonna be one less lonely girl
One less lonely girl
One less lonely girl
One less lonely girl
There's gonna be one less lonely girl
I'm gonna put you first
I'll show you what you're worth
If you let me inside of your world
There's gonna be one less lonely girl
Christmas wasn't merry, 14th of February not one of them spent with you
How many dinner dates, set dinner plates
And he didn't even touch his food
How many torn photographs are you taping back?
Tell me that you couldn't see an open door
But no more, if you let me inside of your world
There'll be one less lonely girl
Oh no, saw so many pretty faces
Now all I see is you
Oh no, don't need these other pretty faces
'Cause when you're mine, in this world
There's gonna be one less lonely girl
One less lonely girl
One less lonely girl
One less lonely girl
I'm gonna put you first
I'll show you what you're worth
If you let me inside of your world
There's gonna be one less lonely girl
I can fix up your broken heart
I can give you a brand new start
I can make you believe
I just wanna set one girl free to fall
She's free to fall
With me
Her heart's locked and know what I got the key
I'll take you and leave the world with one less lonely girl
One less lonely girl
One less lonely girl
One less lonely girl
One less lonely girl
There's gonna be one less lonely girl
One less lonely girl
One less lonely girl
I'm gonna put you first
I'll show you what you're worth
If you let me inside of your world
One less lonely girl
One less lonely girl
One less lonely girl
I'm gonna put you first
I'll show you what you're worth
If you let me inside of your world
There's gonna be one less lonely girl
