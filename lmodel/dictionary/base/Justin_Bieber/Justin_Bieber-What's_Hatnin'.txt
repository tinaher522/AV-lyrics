<song artist="Justin_Bieber" title="What's_Hatnin'">
I pull up and then I hop out, like what's hatnin'
I knock on the door, she know who it is, what's hatnin'
We on a roll, we 'bout to go, what's hatnin'
We took off in that UFO, like what's hatnin'
What's hatnin', what's hatnin', baby girl what's hatnin'
Don't talk about it, just be about it, whatever happens, it's hatnin'
What's hatnin', what's hatnin', baby girl what's hatnin'
Don't talk about it, just be about it, you got it girl, what's hatnin'
Do you wanna scream and shout?
But I don't wanna fight babe
I guess that's why I'm leavin' now
I can't do nothin' right babe, what's hatnin'
Arguin' won't fix the problem, talk with me and we can solve it
Be real with me, ain't no other option, no other option
Arguin' won't fix the problem, talk with me, baby we can solve it
Be real with me, ain't no other option, no other option
We just need forgiveness baby, I can give the business
I just, I just wanna give it to you
Girl let's pick up where we started, we don't need to worry 'bout it
We just wanna have fun tonight
I pull up and then I hop out, like what's hatnin'
I knock on the door, she know who it is, what's hatnin'
We on a roll, we 'bout to go, what's hatnin'
We took off in that UFO, like what's hatnin'
What's hatnin', what's hatnin', baby girl what's hatnin'
Don't talk about it, just be about it, whatever happens, it's hatnin'
What's hatnin', what's hatnin', baby girl what's hatnin'
Don't talk about it, just be about it, you got it girl, what's hatnin'
In love, what you waiting for?
I've been waiting for a girl like you for a long, long, long, long time now
In love
Don't throw it away, don't throw it away
Arguin' won't fix the problem, talk with me and we can solve it
Be real with me, ain't no other option, no other option
Arguin' won't fix the problem, talk with me, baby we can solve it
Be real with me, ain't no other option, no other option
I pull up and then I hop out, like what's hatnin'
I knock on the door, she know who it is, what's hatnin'
We on a roll, we 'bout to go, what's hatnin'
We took off in that UFO, like what's hatnin'
What's hatnin', what's hatnin', baby girl what's hatnin'
Don't talk about it, just be about it, whatever happens, it's hatnin'
What's hatnin', what's hatnin', baby girl what's hatnin'
Don't talk about it, just be about it, you got it girl, what's hatnin'
Girl you my blessin', with you undressin'
What's hatnin', what's hatnin', what's hatnin', what's hatnin', what's hatnin'
