Never Say Never
Yeah, Yeah, Never, Never, Never
Ever, Ever, Ever
See I Never Thought That I
Could Walk Through fire
I never thought that I 
Could take a burn
I never had the strength 
To take it higher
Until I reached the point of no return
And There's just no turnin' back
When your heart's under attack
Gonna give everything I have
It's my destiny
I will never say never (I will fight)
I will fight 'till forever (Make It right)
When ever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up, Pick it up, Pick it up up up
And Never Say Never
Ne-never Say Never
Ne-never Say Never
Ne-never Say Never
Never Say It
Never Never Say It
I never thought that I
Could feel this power
I never thought that I
Could feel this free
I'm strong enough to climb
The highest tower
And I'm fast enough to run
Across the sea
And There's just no turnin' back
When your heart's under attack
Gonna give everything I have
'Cause this is my destiny
I will never say never (I will fight)
I will fight till' forever (Make It right)
When ever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up, Pick it up, Pick it up, Pick it up up up
And Never Say Never
Here We Go
And now the party must be over
I guess we'll never understand
The sense of your leaving
Was in the way it was planned?
So we grace another table
And raise our glasses one more time
There's a face at the window
And I ain't never, never saying never
I will never say never (I will fight)
I will fight till' forever (Make It right)
When ever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up, Pick it up, Pick it up, Pick it up up up
And Never Say Never
I will never say never (I will fight)
I will fight till' forever (Make It right)
When ever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up, Pick it up, Pick it up, Pick it up up up
And Never Say Never
Ne-never Say Never
Ne-never Say Never
Ne-never Say Never
And Never Say Never
Ne-never Say Never
Ne-never Say Never
Ne-never Say Never
Ne-Never Say Never
