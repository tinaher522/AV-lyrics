<song artist="Justin_Bieber" title="Common_Denominator">
Just a fraction of your love fills the air
And I fall in love with you
All over again, oh
You're the light that feeds the sun
In my world
I'd face a thousand years of pain for my girl
Out of all the things in life that I could fear
The only thing that would hurt me
Is if you weren't here, oh
I don't wanna go back to just being one half of the equation
Do you understand what I'm sayin'?
Girl, without you I'm lost
Can't fix this compass at heart
Between me and love
You're the common denominator
Oh, oh , oh, oh
You're the common denominator
Oh, oh , oh, oh
Before your love was low
Playing girls was my high
You changed the game
Now I put my card to the side, ay
When broken hearts rise up to say, "Love is a lie"
You and I would stand to be love's reply, yeah
Out of all things in life that I could fear, yeah
The only thing that would hurt me is if you weren't here (here, here, yeahhh)
I don't wanna go back to just being one half of the equation
Do you understand what I'm sayin'?  (do you understand?)
Girl, without you I'm lost
Can't fix this compass at heart
Between me and love,
You're the common denominator
Oh, oh , oh, oh
You're the common denominator
Oh, oh , oh, oh
I can't imagine life without your touch,
And every kiss that you give,
You fill me up
And through all the heart achin'
Jealous females hatin'
I'm gonna hold it down for you
You, whoa, oh, whoa
You're the common denominator
Oh yeah whoa
I don't wanna to go back
I don't wanna go back to just being one half of the equation
Do you understand what I'm sayin'?
Girl, without you I'm lost
Can't fix this compass at heart
Between me and love
You're the common denominator
Oh, oh , oh, oh
You're the common denominator
Oh, oh , oh, oh
Just a fraction of your love fills the air
And I fall in love with you all over again
