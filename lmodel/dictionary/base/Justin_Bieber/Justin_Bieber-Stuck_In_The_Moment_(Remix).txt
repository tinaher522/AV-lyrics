Justin Bieber
With you
With you
I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
Tyga
Ugh, this is kinda how my heart sounds
Every beat like a image in the background
I'm sitting here, thinking where is you now
I wanna tell you but there's too many people round
You know I love you, I care but it's unfair
I ain't perfect but I'm tryna be the best I can
If it's real than its gon' come back again
So I'm letting go, I hope you understand
All your friends say, he don't love you
And the grown ups say it's puppy
Love ain't lust, it's more unlucky
Until you meet a diamond girl, now it's sunny
That I thought
Loving you, it was us against the world
You my favorite girl, for you I would go to war
I, take this all in just to show you
Or maybe I'm just stuck in the moment
Justin Bieber
Now Romeo &amp; Juliet
Bet they never felt the way we felt
Bonnie &amp; Clyde
Never had to hide like
We do
We do
You and I, both know it can't work
It's all fun and games
'Til someone gets hurt
And I don't
I won't let that be you
Now you don't wanna let go
And I don't wanna let you know
That there might be something real between us two
Who knew?
Now we don't wanna fall but
We're trippin' in our hearts
And it's reckless and clumsy
'Cause I know you can't love me here
I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do
To fight with time and space 'cause
I'm still stuck in the moment with you
See like Adam &amp; Eve
Tragedy was our destiny
Like Sonny &amp; Cher
I don't care
I got you baby
See we both
Fightin' every inch of our fibers
'Cause ain't no way it's gonna end right but
We are both too foolish to stop
Now you don't wanna let go
And I don't wanna let you know
That there might be something real between us two
Who knew?
And we don't wanna fall but
We're tripping in our hearts
And it's reckless and clumsy
And I know you can't love me here
I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do
To fight with time and space 'cause
I'm still stuck in the moment with you
See like, just because this cold, cruel world say we can't be
Baby we both have the right to disagree
And I ain't with it
And I don't wanna be so old and gray
Reminiscing 'bout these better days
But convince just telling us to let go
So we'll never know
I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
'Cause everything we did
And everything we have is stuck in the moment
I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
(Oh no no)
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do
(Nothing my heart can do)
To fight with time and space
(And space)
I'm still stuck in the moment with you
Yeah
