Aye aye aye aye aye aye aye
Let's go
Me plus you, I'ma tell you one time
I'ma tell you one time
I'ma tell you one time
One time
When I met you girl my heart went knock knock
Now them butterflies in my stomach won't stop stop
And even though it's a struggle love is all we got
So we goin' keep keep climbin' to the mountain top
Your world is my world
And my fight is your fight
And my breath is your breath
When you're hurt
'Cause girl you're my one love, my one heart, my one life for sure
Let me tell you one time (girl I love, girl I love you)
I'ma tell you one time (girl I love, girl I love you)
And I'ma be your one guy
You'll be my number one girl
Always making time for you
I'ma tell you one time (girl I love, girl I love you)
I'ma tell you one time (girl I love, girl I love you)
You look so deep, you know that it humbles me
You by my side and troubles them don't trouble me
Many have called but the chosen is you
Whatever you want shawty I'll give it to you
Your world is my world
And my fight is your fight
And my breath is your breath
When you're hurt
'Cause girl you're my one love, my one heart, my one life for sure
Let me tell you one time (girl I love, girl I love you)
I'ma tell you one time (girl I love, girl I love you)
And I'ma be your one guy
You'll be my number one girl
Always making time for you
I'ma tell you one time (girl I love, girl I love you)
I'ma tell you one time (girl I love, girl I love you)
And shawty right there
She's got everything I need and I'ma tell her one time (one time)
Give you everything you need, down to my last dime
She makes me happy, I know where I'll be
Right by your side 'cause she is the one for me yeah
Let me tell you one time (girl I love, girl I love you)
(girl I love, girl I love you)
And I'ma be your one guy
You'll be my number one girl
Always making time for you
I'ma tell you one time (girl I love, girl I love you)
(girl I love, girl I love you)
