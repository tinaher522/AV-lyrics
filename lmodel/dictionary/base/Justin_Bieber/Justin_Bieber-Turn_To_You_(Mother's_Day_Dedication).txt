<song artist="Justin_Bieber" title="Turn_To_You_(Mother's_Day_Dedication)">
You worked two jobs, To keep a roof above our heads, You chose, A life for
me, no never gave up, I admire you, For the strength you’ve instilled in
me, You were so young, You were just my age, when you had me mom, You were
so brave. There was nothing gonna stop or get in our way. And I know you
will always be there for me. So when you’re lost and you’re tired, When
you’re broken in two, Let my love take you higher, Cause I, I still turn to
you. I still turn to you, I still turn to you. It was ’94, the year that
everything started to change, From before, You had to be a woman, You were
forced to change your ways, To change your ways
Then you found the Lord, You gave your life to Him, And you could not
ignore, the love he had for you, and I wanted more of your heart.
So when you’re lost and you’re tired, When you’re broken in two, Let my
love take you higher, Cause I, I still turn to you. I still turn to you, I
still turn to you.
I don’t know what I’d if you left me, So please don’t go away, Everything
that you are is who I am, Who I am today. So when you’re lost and you’re
tired, When you’re broken in two, Let my love take you higher, Cause I, I
still turn to you. I still turn to you, I still turn to you.
To you, to you, to you. I Still Turn to you. To you, to you, to you. Cause
I, I turn to you
