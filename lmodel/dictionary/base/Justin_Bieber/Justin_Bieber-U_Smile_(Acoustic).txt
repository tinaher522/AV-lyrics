Oh
Yeah
Mmmm
I'd wait on you forever and a day
Hand and foot
Your world is my world
Yeah
Ain't no way you're ever gon' get
Any less than you should
'Cause baby
You smile, I smile ohhh
You smile, I smile oh
Your lips, my biggest weakness
Shouldn't have let you know
I'm always gonna do what they say yeah
If you need me
I'll come runnin'
From a thousand miles away
When you smile, I smile oh
And whenever you smile, I smile oh
Baby take my open heart and all it offers
'Cause this is as unconditional as it'll ever get
You ain't seen nothing yet
I won't ever hesitate to give you more
'Cause baby
You smile, I smile whoa
You smile, I smile oh
And whenever you smile, I smile
I smile, I smile, I smile
You smile, I smile oh
Baby you won't ever want for nothing
You are my ends and my means now
With you there's no in between
I'm all in
Cause my cards are on the table
And I'm willing and I'm able
But I fold to your wish
Cause it's my command
Whenever you smile, I smile whoa
You smile, I smile
I smile, I smile, I smile
You smile, I smile
And whenever you smile, I smile
When you smile, I smile
You smile, I smile
