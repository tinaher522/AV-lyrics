Oh oh
Oh ohhh
Oh oh
I never thought that it'd be easy
'Cause we're both so distant now
And the walls are closing in on us
And we're wondering how
No one has a solid answer
But just walking in the dark
And you can see the look on my face
It just tears me apart
So we fight
Through the hurt
And we cry and cry and cry and cry
Then we live
And we learn
And we try and try and try and try
So it's up to you
And it's up to me
That we meet in the middle
On our way back down to earth
Down to earth
Down to earth
On our way back down to earth
Oh oh oh oh
Whoa oh
Oh
Mommy you were always somewhere
And daddy I live outta town
So tell me how could I ever be normal somehow?
You tell me this is for the best
So tell me why am I in tears? Oh whoa
So far away and now I just need you here
So we'll fight
Through the hurt
And we'll cry and cry and cry and cry
Then we live
And we learn
And we try and try and try and try
So it's up to you
And it's up to me
That we meet in the middle
On our way back down to earth
Down to earth
Down to earth
On our way back down to earth
Oh oh oh oh
Whoa oh
Oh
We felt so far away from where we used to be
And now we're standing and where do we go
When there's no road
To get to your heart
Let's start over again
So it's up to you
And it's up to me
That we meet in the middle
On our way back down to earth
Down to earth
Down to earth
On our way back down to earth
I never thought that it'd be easy
'Cause we both so distant now
And the walls are closing in on us
And we're wondering how
