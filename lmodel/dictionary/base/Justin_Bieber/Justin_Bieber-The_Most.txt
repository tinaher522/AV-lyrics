<song artist="Justin_Bieber" title="The_Most">
Where are you now that I need ya?
Where are you now that I need ya?
Need you the most
When you broke down I didn’t leave ya
I stay by your side
So where are you now that I need ya?
Need you the most
I gave you attention when nobody else was paying
I gave you the shirt off my back what you saying
To keep you warm
I showed you the game everybody else was playing, that’s for sure
And I was on my knees when nobody else was praying, oh lord
Where are you now that I need ya?
Where are you now that I need ya?
Need you the most
When you broke down I didn’t leave ya
I stay by your side
So where are you now that I need ya?
Need you the most
I gave you my heart when you said yours was broken
Yes I did
I gave you the key when the door wasn’t open
Just admit it
See I gave you faith
Turned your doubt into hoping, can't deny it
Now I'm all alone and my joys turned to moping
Tell me he, where are you now that I need you?
Where are you now?
Where are you now that I need ya?
Couldn’t find you anywhere
Where you broke down I didn’t leave ya
I was by your side
So where are you now that I need ya?
I need you the most
