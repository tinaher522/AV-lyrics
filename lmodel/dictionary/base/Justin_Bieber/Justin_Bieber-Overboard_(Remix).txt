Miley Cyrus
Oh
Hello everybody, how you guys doing tonight?
It feels like we've been out at sea, oh
So back and forth that's how it seems, oh
And when I wanna talk you say to me
That if it's meant to be it will be
Whoa-oh-oh
So crazy is this thing we call love
And now that we've got it, we just can't give up
I'm reaching out for you
Get me out here in the water and I...
Miley Cyrus
I'm overboard
And I need your love to pull me up
I can't swim on my own
It's too much
Feels like I'm drowning without your love
So throw yourself out to me, my lifesaver
Justin Bieber
Life saver, whoa, oh life saver
My life saver, whoa
Life saver, whoa, oh life saver
Never understood you when you'd say (whoa)
You wanted me to meet you halfway (whoa)
Oh, I felt like I was doing my part
You kept thinking you were coming up short
It's funny how things change 'cause now I see, oh
So crazy is this thing we call love
And now that we've got it we just can't give up
I'm reaching out for you
Got me out here in the water and I...
Justin Bieber and Miley Cyrus
I'm overboard (overboard)
And I need your love to pull me up (to pull me up)
I can't swim on my own
It's too much (it's too much)
Feels like I'm drowning without your love
So throw yourself out to me, my lifesaver
Oh, it's supposed to be some give and take, I know
But you're only taking and not giving anymore
So what do I do? (so what do I do)
Cause I still love you (I still love you baby)
And you're the only one who can save me, whoa whoa whoa
I'm overboard
And I need your love to pull me up (pull me up)
I can't swim on my own
It's too much (it's too much)
Feels like I'm drowning without your love
So throw yourself out to me
My lifesaver
Life saver, whoa, oh life saver
My life saver, whoa
Life saver, whoa, oh life saver
Life saver, whoa, oh life saver
My life saver, whoa
Life saver, whoa, oh life saver
Yeah
Give it up for Miley Cyrus everybody
Alright well
