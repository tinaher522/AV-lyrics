<song artist="Justin_Bieber" title="Christmas_Love">
Baby I will not pout
Baby I will not cry
'Cause I've got your love this Christmas time
When the snow's on the ground
And it's freezing outside
I've got your love this Christmas
On every list I've ever sent
You're the gift I love the best
So deck the halls and all the rest
And warm me up with your Christmas love
Hey angel in the snow
I'm under the mistletoe
You are the one
You're my very own Christmas love
Tell Santa I'm cool this year
My present is standing right here
Thank God above for my very own Christmas love
Like a beautiful tree, you can light up the room
But your kind of star can't be removed
Yea, and like a beautiful carol
I get lost in your song
And I will forever sing along
On every list I've ever sent
You're the gift I love the best
So deck the halls and all the rest
And warm me up with your Christmas love
Hey angel in the snow
I'm under the mistletoe
You are the one
You're my very own Christmas love
Tell Santa I'm cool this year
My present is standing right here
Thank God above for my very own Christmas love
All the lovers around the world (all the lovers)
Got me singing Merry Merry Christmas
Merry merry Christmas (and Happy Holidays)
Every boy and every girl
Stay close to the ones you love and thank God above
That you got someone this year
That can feel your heart with cheer, yeah
Ooohhh
Hey angel in the snow
I'm under the mistletoe
You are the one
You're my very own Christmas love
Tell Santa I'm cool this year
My present is standing right here
Thank God above for my very own Christmas love
Hey angel in the snow
I'm under the mistletoe
You are the one
You're my very own Christmas love
Tell Santa I'm cool this year
My present is standing right here
Thank God above for my very own Christmas love
(For my very own Christmas love)
(For my very own Christmas love)
(Give me a kiss baby)
(Give me a kiss baby)
(For my very own Christmas love)
