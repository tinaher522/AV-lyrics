<song artist="Justin_Bieber" title="Kiss_And_Tell">
Yeah
J-J-J JB
Yeah, whoa
No, no
Now I can see it girl
You ain't gotta say nothing
Your lips are calling me
Like they wanna do something
I feel the chemistry
Yeah you're into me
A little kiss is a definite possibility
Seen you a couple times
Had a couple conversations
Since you've been on my mind
Had a couple observations
Like you're a fly chick
You could be my chick
Play by the rules and you can get what I give
Just keep it quiet, keep it on my hush
And what we do keep it just between us
I don't wanna see you tweet about JB 'cause
The only people that should know is you and me so
Baby I know that you're cool with rocking with me
But I can't have you telling everybody
You got me all twisted with your lips like this
So tell me, tell me are you gonna kiss (kiss) kiss and tell?
Tell me are you gonna kiss (kiss) kiss and tell?
Tell me are you gonna kiss me?
Then tell everybody?
Now she got me twisted with your lips girl
Are you gonna kiss and tell?
It's confidential, no one has to do with it
But you and me girl
Telling would ruin it
Don't need that TMZ
All in our privacy
Use them lips for kissing girl
If you wanna ride with me
And if you wanna tell somebody
Then we can call the whole thing off, no problem
You can go your way, and I'll go mine
But I'd rather spend a little time with you, yeah
Just keep it quiet, keep it on my hush
And what we do keep it just between us
I don't wanna see you tweet about JB 'cause
The only people that should know is you and me so
Baby I know that you're cool with rocking with me
But I can't have you telling everybody
You got me all twisted with your lips like this
So tell me are you gonna kiss (kiss) kiss and tell?
Tell me are you gonna kiss (kiss) kiss and tell?
Tell me are you gonna kiss me?
Then tell everybody? oh no
Now she got me twisted with your lips girl
Are you gonna kiss and tell?
Tell, said are you gonna kiss and tell?
Tell, said are you gonna kiss and tell?
Tell, said are you gonna kiss and tell?
Kiss and tell, oh
Don't tell your homies
Don't tell your mama
Don't tell your girlfriends
That'll start some drama
Stay off that facebook
I'll treat you real good
You keep this private
And you can get what I give
Baby I know that you're cool with rocking with me
But I can't have you telling everybody (everybody)
You got me all twisted with your lips like this
So tell me are you gonna kiss (kiss) kiss and tell?
Tell me are you gonna kiss (kiss) kiss and tell?
Tell me are you gonna kiss me?
Then tell everybody?
Now she got me twisted with your lips girl
Are you gonna kiss and tell?
Kiss and tell, whoa
Whoa oh
I'm not about that
If you're gonna kiss and tell
No, no, no
If you're gonna kiss and tell
If you're gonna kiss and tell
That's not me
