<song artist="Justin_Bieber" title="Maria">
She says she met me on a tour
She keeps knocking on my door,
she won't leave me, leave me alone
This girl she wouldn't stop, almost had to call the cops
She was scheming, ooh, she was wrong
Cause she wanted all my attention
And she was dragging my name through the dirt
She was dying for my affection
But she got mad 'cause I didn't give it to her
I'm talking to you, Maria
Why you wanna do me like that?
That ain't my baby, that ain't my girl
Maria, why you wanna play me like that?
She ain't my baby, she ain't my girl
But she talking in, and she needs to quit it
But never this, all I know she's not mine
That ain't my baby, that ain't my girl
'Cause she's wildin out, what she talking about?
Let me tell you now this girl she's not mine
She ain't my baby, she ain't my girl
Now she's in the magazines, on tv, making a scene
Oh she's crazy, crazy in love
And she's all over the news, saying everything but the truth
She's faking, faking it all
Cause she wanted all my attention
And she was dragging my name through the dirt
She was dying for my affection
But she got mad 'cause I didn't give it to her
I'm talking to you, maria
Why you wanna do me like that?
That ain't my baby, that ain't my girl
Maria, why you wanna play me like that?
She ain't my baby, she ain't my girl
But she talking in, and she needs to quit it
But never this, all I know she's not mine
That ain't my baby, that ain't my girl
'Cause she's wildin out, what she talking about?
Let me tell you now this girl she's not mine
She ain't my baby, she ain't my girl
Why are you trying, trying to lie girl
When ain't I never met you at all
Saying goodbye, but how could ya
You throw this, you throw this
Your foolness, seduces
Maria why you wanna do me like that?
That ain't my baby, that ain't my girl
Maria, why you wanna play me like that?
She ain't my baby, she ain't my girl
But she talking in, and she needs to quit it
But never this, all I know she's not mine
That ain't my baby, that ain't my girl
'Cause she's wildin out, what she talking about?
Let me tell you now that girl she's not mine
She ain't my baby, she ain't my girl
That ain't my baby, that ain't my girl
She ain't my baby, she ain't my girl
She ain't my baby, she ain't my girl
She ain't my baby, she's not my girl
