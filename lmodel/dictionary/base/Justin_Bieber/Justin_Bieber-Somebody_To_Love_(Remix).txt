Justin Bieber
Oh (oh, oh oh)
Oh oh
For you I'd write a symphony
I'd tell the violin
It's time to sink or swim
Watch them play for ya
For you I'd be (whoa oh)
Running a thousand miles
Just to get to where you are
Step to the beat of my heart
I don't need a whole lot
But for you I admit I
I'd rather give you the world
Or we can share mine
I know I won't be the first one
giving you all this attention
Baby listen
I just need somebody to love
I, I don't need too much, just somebody to love
Somebody to love
I don't need nothing else
I promise girl I swear
I just need somebody to love
I need somebody
I, I need somebody
I need somebody
I, I need somebody
Usher
Every day
I bring the sun around
I sweep away the clouds
Smile for me, smile for me
I would take
Every second, every single time
Spend it like my last dime
Step to the beat of my heart
I don't need a whole lot
But for you I admit I
I'd rather give you the world
Or we can share mine
I know I won't be the first one
Givin' you all this attention
So baby listen
