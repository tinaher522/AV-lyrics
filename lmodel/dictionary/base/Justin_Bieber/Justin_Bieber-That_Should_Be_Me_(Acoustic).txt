<song artist="Justin_Bieber" title="That_Should_Be_Me_(Acoustic)">
Everybody's laughin' in my mind
Rumors spreadin' about this other guy
Do you do what you did when you did with me?
Does he love you the way I can?
Did you forget all the plans that you made with me?
'Cause baby I didn't
That should be me, holdin' your hand
That should be me, makin' you laugh
That should be me, this is so sad
That should be me, that should be me
That should be me, feelin' your kiss
That should be me, buyin' you gifts
This is so wrong, I can't go on
Do you believe
That that should be me
That should be me
You said you needed a little time from my mistakes
It's funny how you used that time to have me replaced
Did you think that I wouldn't see you out at the movies?
Whatcha doin' to me?
You're taking him where we used to go
Now if you're trying to break my heart
It's working, 'cause you know
That that should be me, holdin' your hand
That should be me, makin' you laugh
That should be me, this is so sad
That should be me, that should be me
That should be me, feelin' your kiss
That should be me, buyin' you gifts
This is so wrong, I can't go on
Do you believe
That should be me
I need to know should I fight for love or disarm
It's getting harder to shield
This pain in my heart oh oh oh
That should be me, holdin' your hand
That should be me, makin' you laugh
That should be me, this is so sad
That should be me, that should be me
That should be me, feelin' your kiss
That should be me, buyin' you gifts
This is so wrong, I can't go on
Do you believe
That that should be me
Holding your hand
That should be me
The one making you laugh, oh baby oh
That should be me
That should be me, giving you flowers
That should be me
Talking for hours, that should be me, that should be me
That should be me
Never gonna let you go
I'm never gonna let you go whoa oh oh
That should be me
I'm never gonna let you go whoa oh oh
That should be me
Never gonna let you go hey ey
I'm never gonna let you go whoa oh oh
That should be me
I'm never gonna let you go whoa oh oh
