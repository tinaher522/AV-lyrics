<song artist="Justin_Bieber" title="We_Are">
Happy birthday. 
You ain't gotta question it. 
You already know the answer. 
The truth don't make us relevant. 
Hurts but it's necessary. 
Don't want us to lose what we are 
Don't want us to lose what we are. 
Lose what we are. 
If it ain't broke then we don't need to fix it. 
Believing in what she say'll have you livid. 
Know they won't be happy 'til our love is over. 
They tryna break us up but you don't wanna get it. 
They ain’t ever had trust like how we got it. 
They ain't never had a chance how you got it. 
So they can't help but to come and hate on it. 
They see what we got and you know they want it, don't question it. 
You ain't gotta question it. 
You already know the answer. 
The truth don't make us relevant. 
Hurts but it's necessary. 
Don't want us to lose what we are. 
Don't want us to lose what we are. 
Lose what we are. 
It's like you're always looking for a problem. 
The raining of equations for you to solve 'em. 
So quick to turn nothin' right into somethin'. 
Get the numbers out my phone, go 'head and call 'em. 
They ain’t ever had trust like how we got it. 
They ain't never had a chance how you got it. 
So they can't help but to come and hate on it. 
They see what we got and you know they want it, don't question it. 
You ain't gotta question it. 
You already know the answer. 
The truth don't make us relevant. 
Hurts but it's necessary. 
Don't want us to lose what we are. 
Don't want us to lose what we are. 
Lose what we are. 
She texts me "How's you love life?" and "How are you?", I said "I'm good". 
They only get as close as you allow them to. 
We should be closer together, warm oceans, better weather. 
Instead of us playing games forever, she says whatever. 
I says whatever, who get you wetter than a half moon wearer. 
HSTRY sweater, serendipity when you with me. 
Swear you love that one thing we did that one time in that one place. 
Blew your mind, you got my mind going when I'm home. 
I'm serious girl, a much older dude, a whole 42. 
I've accomplished my goals, it's only you. 
You and I in that Wraith, retire my pimp super-fly cape. 
Just my Mets cap and my badge and I'm straight. 
Esco. 
You ain't gotta question it. 
You already know the answer. 
The truth don't make us relevant. 
Hurts but it's necessary. 
Don't want us to lose what we are. 
Don't want us to lose what we are. 
Lose what we are.
