Justin Bieber
Never say never
(never, ever)
Yeah yeah
See I never thought that I could walk through fire
I never thought that I could take the burn
I never had the strength to take it higher
Until I reached the point of no return
And there's just no turning back
When your heart's under attack
Gonna give everything I have
It's my destiny
I will never say never, I will fight
I will fight till forever, to make it right
Whenever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up
Pick it up
Pick it up
Pick it up up up
And never say never
Ne-never say never (never)
Ne-never say never (never)
Ne-never say never (never)
I never thought that I could feel this power
I never thought that I could feel this free
I'm strong enough to climb the highest tower
And I'm fast enough to run across the sea, oh-oh
And there's just no turning back, oh no
When your heart's under attack, oh no
Gonna give everything I have
'cause this is my destiny
I will never say never (never say never) I will fight
I will fight till forever (make it right)
Whenever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up
Pick it up
Pick it up
Pick it up, up, up
And never say never
Jaden Smith and Justin Bieber
Here we go!
Guess who?
J Smith and JB (Uh-huh!)
I got ya little bro
I can handle him
Hold up
I, I can handle him
Jaden Smith
Now he's bigger than me
Taller than me
And he's older than me
And stronger than me
And his arms a little bit longer than me
But he ain't on a JB song with me!
I be trying a chill
They be trying to sour the thrill
No pun intended, was raised by the power of Will
Like Luke with the force, when push comes to shove
Like Kobe in the 4th, ice water with blood
I gotta be the best, and yes
We're the flyest
Like David and Goliath
I conquered the giant
So now I got the world in my hand
I was born from two stars
So the moon's where I land (I'm gone)
Jaden Smith and Justin Bieber
I will never say never (never say it, never, never say it) I will fight
I will fight till forever (okay, okay) to make it right
Whenever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up
Pick it up
Pick it up
Pick it up, up, up
And never say never
Say never (never say it, never say it)
Say never (okay, okay)
Whenever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up
Pick it up
Pick it up,
Pick it up, up, up
And never say never
Ne-never say never (never say it)
Ne-never say never (never say it)
Ne-never say never (never say it)
never, never, say never
And never say never
Ne-never say never (never say it)
Ne-never say never (no, nope, never say it)
Ne-never say never
And never say never
