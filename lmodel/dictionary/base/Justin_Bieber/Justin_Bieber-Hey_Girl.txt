<song artist="Justin_Bieber" title="Hey_Girl">
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Smoking on the beat, with my backpack on
And my snapback on, with the rap back on, uhuh
Beautiful girls wearing high heels
Asking how I feel, I feel I, uhuh
That’s when you walk by
I’m like damn you fly,
And I was like uhuh
You ask me where I’m from
And I say C-C-C-anada, uhuh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Uhuh, uhuh, yeah
Uhuh, uhuh, oh yeah
Uhuh, uhuh, oh yeah
Hey girl, hey girl, hey girl
Hey girl, hey girl, hey girl
Hey girl, hey girl, hey girl
Hey girl, hey girl, hey girl
Hey girl, hey girl, hey girl
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Louis Vuittons, on your feet
Take them off and make me say, uhuh
Oh the curves got me going crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, uhuh
Let me ask you girl where your mind is
Let me just tell you’re the flyest, uhuh
Uhuh, uhuh, yeah
Uhuh, uhuh, oh yeah
Uhuh, uhuh, oh yeah 
Uhuh, uhuh, oh yeah
Uhuh, uhuh, oh yeah
Uhuh, uhuh, oh yeah
Hey girl, hey girl, hey girl
Hey girl, hey girl, hey girl
Hey girl, hey girl, hey girl
Hey girl, hey girl, hey girl
Hey girl, hey girl, hey girl
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
