<song artist="Justin_Bieber" title="Yellow_Raincoat">
Guess I'll put on my raincoat, my yellow raincoat
Baby, it's keeping me dry
I'll put on my raincoat, my yellow raincoat
You'll know exactly why
When the wind blows, and the sun goes away
And the sand fall, stormy day,
That's what it's for, yeah, that's what it's for, yeah
And as it pours down, the water sprinkles off my jacket slow yeah, jacket slow yeah
Whenever I do have it, do I ever want this to face me
Whenever I do have it, do I want this thing to make me
Cause the fame and the money, and the girls will drive you crazy (drive you crazy)
And all the "He said, she said", I'm thinking maybe
Just put on my...
Guess I'll put on my raincoat, my yellow raincoat
Baby, it's keeping me dry
I'll put on my raincoat, my yellow raincoat
You'll know exactly why
But as I look around, I see
When I'm thinking never change me.
Well, all I gotta do is stay me
Let's the rest do the work and I'm sure that it'll be fine, be fine
When the wind blows, and the sun goes away
And the sand fall, stormy day,
That's what it's for, yeah, that's what it's for, yeah
And as it pours down, the water sprinkles off my jacket slow yeah, jacket slow yeah
Whenever I do have it, do I ever want this to face me
Whenever I do have it, do I want this thing to make me
Cause the fame and the money, and the girls will drive you crazy
And all the "He said, she said", I'm thinking maybe
Just put on my...
Guess I'll put on my raincoat, my yellow raincoat
Baby, it's keeping me dry
I'll put on my raincoat, my yellow raincoat
You'll know exactly why
Turutu turutu turuturu (just put on my) [4x]
Guess I'll put on my raincoat, my yellow raincoat
Baby, it's keeping me dry
I'll put on my raincoat, my yellow raincoat
You'll know exactly why
