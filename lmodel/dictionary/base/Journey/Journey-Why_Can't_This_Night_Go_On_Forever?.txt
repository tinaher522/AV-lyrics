<song artist="Journey" title="Why_Can't_This_Night_Go_On_Forever?">
Lost in twilight...The memories
Precious moments, you and me
We've been old friends
All through the years
Picture postcards, sharing tears
Whats in our hearts theres never time.... to say
Need you tonight lover don't fade away
I see your city lights as I walk away
Why can't this night...go on forever?
Without love we...we won't survive
run together, we rule the night
Tell me secrets, oh....that make you cry
wheres the laughter, we gotta try
Whats in our hearts there's never time to say
Need you tonight lover don't fade away
Like a photograph, that time won't erase
Why can't this night.....go...on forever
Go on forever....?
Go forever forever...yeah...
