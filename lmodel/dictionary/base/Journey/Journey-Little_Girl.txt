<song artist="Journey" title="Little_Girl">
It was just the month of May
Words got in my way, girl, I'm so sorry
So I'm reaching out to you
With the hope to see you through
Just another day
Do you see the words I'm trying to say?
But words get in my way, girl, I really mean it
Yes, I warned you from the start
That I could break your heart
So girl don't stay
Ooh little girl
Ooh little girl
Ooh little girl
I'm the fool that plays the part
the one that broke your heart
Girl, I'm so sorry
So what more can a poor boy do
I'm reaching out to you so now don't you stay
Ooh little girl
Ooh little girl
Ooh little girl
Shades turn red from green to blue
What more can I do, I told you this before
So please walk out that door
I told you from the start that love could break your heart
Girl, I'm so sorry
Ooh little girl
Ooh little girl
Ooh little girl
