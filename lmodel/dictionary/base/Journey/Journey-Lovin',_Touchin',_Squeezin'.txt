<song artist="Journey" title="Lovin',_Touchin',_Squeezin'">
You make me weep
And want to die
Just when 
You said we'd try
Lovin', touchin', squeezin'
Each other
When I'm alone
All by myself
You're out
With someone else
Lovin', touchin', squeezin'
Each other
You're tearin' me apart
Every, every day
You're tearin' me apart
Oh, what can I say?
You're tearin' me apart
It won't be long, yes
Till you're alone
When your lover
Oh, he hasn't come home
'Cause he's lovin'
Ooh, he's touchin'
He's squeezin'
Another
He's tearin' you apart
Ooh, every, every day
He's tearin' you apart
Oh, girl, what can you say?
'Cause he's lovin', touchin' another
Now it's your turn, girl, to cry
