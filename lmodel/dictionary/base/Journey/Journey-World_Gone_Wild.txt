<song artist="Journey" title="World_Gone_Wild">
See the signs, madness all around us
Somewhere I hear sirens wailing thru the night
Read the Times, starts to make me wonder
Is there more to life than black and white
I'd never thought I'd question
(never thought I'd question)
The doubt I'm seeing everywhere
(doubt I'm seeing everywhere)
Standing there beside me, you're the answer
(you're the answer)
When I lose my faith, you're there
Face the fire, in a world gone wide
You're the fortress in my life
See the world through a child's eyes
They can't fool me now
I don't believe it's a world gone wide
It's a lie, the more you got
The more you want, it leads to nowhere
Should have learned by now
What is life without someone to share
The mountains that you climb to reach the sky
With everyone uncertain (everyone uncertain)
The future's never really clear
(future's never really clear)
Standing here beside me, you're the reason
I found my faith again with you here
Face the fire, in a world gone wide
You're the fortress in my life
See the world through a child's eyes
They can't bring me now
I don't believe it's a world gone wide
Now you can count on me, to keep you safe
I'll be your shelter from the storm
Come lay down with me, and let our spirits melt us into one
