<song artist="Journey" title="Let_It_Take_You_Back">
Driving down the road you swear you've been before
Day dreaming about the days gone by
Faces and places that you're missing from your life
Disappear like ghosts in the night
You wonder how you made it through your high school days
Trying anything to get you high
Hanging out at the pool hall by the old arcade
Cold beer and fake IDs on Friday night
The song comes on the radio
Something that you used to know
Sounds of familiar sounds so right
Let it take you back
To a simpler place in time
Where the melody reminds you
Of a love you left behind
Let the music move you
Until you feel like letting letting go
Like a postcard from the past
Let it take you back
When record stores sold 33s and 45s
Couldn't wait to hold the album in my hand
Before email and the internet
How I stood in line
To buy tickets just to see my favorite band
The rhythm that still gets to you
You have a flash of deja-vu
You listen to the soundtrack of your life
Let it take you back
To a simpler place in time
Where the melody reminds you of a love you left behind
Let the music move you
Until you feel like letting letting go
Like a postcard from the past
Let it take you back
Yeah!
And we'd climb into the backseat of my Chevrolet
Smoking cigarettes and singing songs
Didn't have a worry, didn't have a care
I wonder where the innocence is gone
The song comes on the radio
Something that you used to know
Sounds so familiar sounds so right
Let it take you back
To a simpler place in time
Where the melody reminds you of a love you left behind
Let the music move you
Until you feel like letting letting go
Like a postcard from the past
Let it take you back
Oh!
Let it take you back
Where emotions start to flow
You come to your senses
Cause its only rock and roll
Like a faded photograph
Let it take you back
Yeah!
Let it take you back
Oh, let it take you back
Oh yeah yeah yeah
Do you remember!
Let it take you back
