<song artist="Journey" title="Signs_Of_Life">
It's been 40 days since I've heard from you
This waiting game you put me through
I feel the silence killing me day to day
Losing hope I lose myself
Its got me thinking there's someone else
We need to talk you give me metaphores
By the way what are you trying to say?
(chorus)
Try to not think about you
I'm not a dead man walking without you
You know I'll be alright
I'm showing signs of life
You left me barely breathing
I've had time for the healing
And now I've opened my eyes
I'm showing signs of life
Lying next to me were you ever mine?
Just wasting love and wasted time
Did you ever find what you were looking for
The night you took my breath away
I miss your love I miss your touch
But this holding on it hurts too much
And now its my turn to walk away
I'll be OK
(chorus)
Well tell your friends that you stole my heart
But you'll never get a piece of my soul
You took my love teared my life apart
But theres more to me than you'll ever know
Try to not think about you
I'm not a dead man walking without you
You know I'll be alright
Showing signs of life
Try to not think about you
I'm not a dead man walking without you
You know I'll be alright
I'm showing signs of life
You left me barely breathing
I've had time for the healing
And now I've opened my eyes
I'm showing signs of life
Seeing signs of life
