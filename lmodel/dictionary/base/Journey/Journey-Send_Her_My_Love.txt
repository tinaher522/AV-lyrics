<song artist="Journey" title="Send_Her_My_Love">
It's been so long
Since I've seen her face
You say she's doing fine
I still recall
A sad caf√©
How it hurt so bad
To see her cry
I didn't want to say good-bye
Send her my love
Memories remain
Send her my love
Roses never fade
Send her my love
The same hotel
The same old room
I'm on the road again
She needed so much more
Than I could give
We knew our love
Could not pretend
Broken hearts can always mend
Send her my love
Memories remain
Send her my love
Roses never fade
Send her my love
Callin' out her name I'm dreaming
Reflections of a face I'm seeing
It's her voice that keeps on haunting me
Send her, send her my love
Roses never fade
Memories remain
Send her, send her my love
