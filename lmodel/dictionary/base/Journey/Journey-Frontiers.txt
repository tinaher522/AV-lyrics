<song artist="Journey" title="Frontiers">
Oh yeah
Progress flys, into our lives
Got to find time, find time
To talk digital
You're doin' fine
Machines never mind
They never mind
Out on the border
Of a changing skyline
We put hope in front of fear
And all the heroes
Have gone east of Eden
We all need new frontiers
Ooh It's a 3D rise
All technical jive
Take a video dive
War is for fools
Crisis is cool
Barbarians play
Out on the border
Of a changing skyline
We put hope in front of fear
And all the heroes
Have gone east of Eden
We all need new frontiers
New, new, frontiers
Barbarians play away, away, away... Play
Out on the border
Of a changing skyline
We put hope in front of fear
And all the heroes
Have gone east of Eden
We all need new frontiers
Out on the border
Of a changing skyline
We put hope in front of fear
And all the heroes
Have gone east of Eden
We all need new frontiers
