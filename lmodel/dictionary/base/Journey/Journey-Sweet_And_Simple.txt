<song artist="Journey" title="Sweet_And_Simple">
Try and keep it simple
Not too far away
Movin' slow, so simple
Never felt this way
Movin' sweet, so simple
Takin' time to say
The way to being, to being simple
Never felt this way
Don't be lonely,
Oh, my friends, forget the past
Sweet as sugar
When you're movin', when you're movin' slow at last
It's what I like to do.
How could it be so simple
To forget the way
A way to being, to being simple
Never felt this way
Oh, don't be lonely
No, no, no, forget the past
Sweet as sugar
When you're movin' slow, you're movin' slow at last
It's what I like to do, yes
It's what I like to do.
It's what I like to do.
It's what I like to do. (Don't be lonely, lonely, lonely)
It's what I like to do. (Sweet as sugar, sugar, sugar)
It's what I like to do.
It's what I like to do. (Movin' slow, movin' slow at last)
It's what I like to do.
It's what I like to do. (Don't be lonely, lonely, lonely)
It's what I like to do.
It's what I like to do. (Oh, sweet as sugar, sugar, sugar)
