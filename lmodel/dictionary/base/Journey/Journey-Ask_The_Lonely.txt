<song artist="Journey" title="Ask_The_Lonely">
You've been picked and it's over
What's that chip on your shoulder?
Outside were solid rainbows
Inside is where the heart grows
Picking up the pieces
Something more to believe in
As you search the embers
Think what you had, remember
Hang on, don't go let go now
You know, with every heartbeat
We love, nothing comes easy
Hang on, ask the lonely
You've got some fascination
With your high expectations
This love is your obsession
Your heart, your past possession
Let down your defenses
Won't be up to the one who cares
As you search the embers
Think what you had, remember
Hang on, don't go let go now
You know, with every heartbeat
We love, nothing comes easy
Hang on, ask the lonely
When you're feeling love's unfair, you just ask the lonely
When you're lost in deep despair, you just ask the lonely
When you're feeling love's unfair, you just ask the lonely
When you're lost in deep despair, you just ask the lonely
When you're feeling love's unfair, you just ask the lonely
When you're lost in deep despair, you just ask the lonely
Ask the lonely
When you're down in deep despair
When you're down in deep despair
Ask the lonely, lonely, lonely
