<song artist="Journey" title="Be_Good_To_Yourself">
Running out of self-control
Getting close to an overload
Up against a no win situation
Shoulder to shoulder
Push and shove
I'm hanging up my boxing gloves
I'm ready for a long vacation
Be good to yourself when nobody else will
Oh be good to yourself
You're walking a high wire
Caught in a cross fire
Oh be good to yourself
When you can't give no more
They want it all but you gotta say no
I'm turning off the noise that makes me crazy
Looking back with no regrets
To forgive is to forget
I want a little peace of mind to turn to
Be good to yourself when nobody else will
Oh be good to yourself
You're walking a high wire
Caught in a cross fire
Oh be good to yourself
Be good to yourself when nobody else will
