<song artist="Journey" title="Winds_Of_March">
I covered you in roses
Like the stars at night
I covered you in love
Like a blanket on a cold winter's night
I covered you with joy
To make your lifetime big and bright
You touched me with your eyes
Soft as an evening breeze
You held me in your arms
As the winds rushed through the trees
You are my child
Make my lifetime big and bright
You are my child
You came like the winds of March
With all the love in your eyes
You are my child
You came like the morning lights
With all your love in your eyes
You are my child
You came like the morning light
With all your love in your eyes
