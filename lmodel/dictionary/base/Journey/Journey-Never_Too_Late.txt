<song artist="Journey" title="Never_Too_Late">
Her head is filled with doubt
Search her heart for faith that can't be found
Ooh yeah
He's running desperate now
All that he's become is just not working anymore
He's needing something more
Someone that he used to be
Part of her is a mystery
Spinning around in an empty place
Lie to themselves till they're blind with rage
It's never too late
To feel the world come crashing down
It's never too late
It's darkest just before the dawn
They can rise above it all to see there's life beyond the pain
Never thought they'd fall this far
You know it's never too late to change
So much to understand
So much to feel and finally now you can
Ooh yeah
They'll see a different day
All because they faced themselves
And now I hear them say they're gonna be okay
She found who she used to be and now there is no mystery
Open his eyes in a brand new place
A different soul with a different face
It's never too late
To feel the world come crashing down
It's never too late
It's darkest just before the dawn
They can rise above it all
To see there's life beyond the pain
Never thought they'd fall this far
Love is waiting, love is patient, love is kind
Love is falling into places in their minds
They love enough to know the difference
The dream they had today, don't throw it all away
It's never too late
To feel the world come crashing down
It's never too late
It's darkest just before the dawn
They can rise above it all
To see there's life beyond the pain
Never thought they'd fall this far
You know it's never too late to change
To rise above it all, never question, never fall
There is no mystery they are who they used to be
They're in a brand new place, a different soul and a different face
The dreams they had today, don't throw it all away
