<song artist="Journey" title="Too_Late">
See the stop light turnin' red
Don't you listen to what it said
All the things you try to hide
They keep you runnin' hard inside
Oh, you got to leave this town before it's
(Too late) Too late (Too late) Too late
Too late to make the change.
Ooh, yes my friend, you're fading fast
If you stay here you won't last
Before your time has run astray
You've got to try to get away
Oh, you got to leave this place before it's...
(Too late) Too late (Too late) Too late
Too late to make the change.
Whoa
Too late to make the change
It's too late, too late
Too late to make the change
Yes, it's time to make the change
Yes, it's time to rearrange
So my friend, I join the fight for the things you know are right
Oh, you got to leave this town before it's
(Too late) Too late (Too late) Too late
Too late to make the change.
Too late, too late
Too late to make the change
Too late... before it's too late...
