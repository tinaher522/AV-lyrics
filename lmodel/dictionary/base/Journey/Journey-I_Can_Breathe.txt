<song artist="Journey" title="I_Can_Breathe">
Caught in a crowded city...buildings are closin' in
Drowin' in my emotion...can't tell you where I've been
Out of place...runnin' out of space
I get the urge to leave
With every step...I catch my breath
I'm seein' the sky once more
Outside my door I'll breathe
I can breathe
I'm ready to try again
I'll breathe
The weight that's upon my shoulders
The pressure that comes and goes
If only the ghost would leave me
That pushes and pulls my soul
I search to find some peace of mind
And now's the time to start
With every step I catch my breath
I'm seein' the sky once more
Outside my door I'll breathe
I can breathe
I'm ready to try again
I'm alive again I'll breathe
With every step I catch my breath
It gives me my release
I can breathe
I'm ready to try again
I'm alive again I'll breathe
Crowded city closin' in...gonna be alright
I remember where I've been...gonna be alright
Feel the pressure come and go...it's gonna be alright
Ghosts can push and pull my soul...
Gonna be alright...be alright
With every step I catch my breath
It gives me my release
I can breathe
I'm ready to try again...
I'm alive again I'll breathe...yes I'll breathe
