<song artist="Journey" title="I_Can_See_It_In_Your_Eyes">
Baby..Too bad...I used to love you girl 
I..Don't care..No more about your face 
No you..Make me mad...The way you cat around 
With your lips, your legs 
And all your sexy ways 
Do you got another lover now 
Do you think it's me you're foolin' now 
No..No 
(chorus) 
Oh....I can see it in your eyes 
Ever since you walked away 
Said your last goodbye 
Oh...I can see it in your eyes 
All the damage has been done 
No more alibis 
Oh you...never hear 
A single word I say 
No you..turn away 
Where do you disappear 
Oh I've had enough 
You need to get a life 
It's all..so tired 
I think I'm out of here 
Do you got another lover now 
Do you think it's me you're foolin' now 
No. 
And when you're alone remember why 
You had never learned how to cry. 
No...No 
(chorus) 
Oh...I can see it in your eyes 
Ever since you walked away 
Said your last goodbye 
Oh...I can see it in your eyes 
All the damage has been done 
No more alibis 
Say you got another lover now 
Tell me who you think you're foolin' now 
(chorus) 
Oh...I can see it in your eyes 
Ever since you walked away 
Said your last goodbye 
Oh...I can see it in your eyes 
All the damage has been done 
No more alibis 
Oh...... 
Oh......
