<song artist="Journey" title="I'll_Be_Alright_Without_You">
I've been thinkin' about the times
You walked out on me
There were moments I'd believe
You were there
Do I miss you
Or am I lying to myself again
I do these things
(It's all because of you)
I keep holding on, but I'll try
(Try not to think of you)
Love, don't leave me lonely
I'll be alright without you
There'll be someone else
I keep telling myself
I'll be alright without you
Oh, love's an empty face
I got to replace
(You don't need it)
People wonderin'
Why we broke apart
The great pretender
Here I go again
These things I do
(It's all because of you)
I'll keep holding on
But I'll try
(Try not to think of you)
All I wanted was to hold you
I'll be alright without you
There'll be someone else
I keep telling myself
I'll be alright without you
Oh, love's an empty face
I got to replace
(You don't need it)
I'll be alright without you
There'll be someone else
I keep telling myself
I'll be alright without you
Oh, love's an empty face
I got to replace
(You don't need it)
