<song artist="Journey" title="To_Be_Alive_Again">
Doin' time... where it takes you 
You know it's time that can break you 
We get caught in a moment... 
Just steep walkin' most of our lives 
In your mind (when you need it) 
With a song (to help you believe it) 
You can reinvent your world 
Anytime you like 
Chorus:
To be alive again... 
Wakin' up from where you been 
Younger now than you were then 
You're comin' 'round again 
Do you remember when... 
Life was so much simpler then 
Like summer nights that never end 
To be alive again 
Find the smile... 
You've been missin' 
There's someone that you could be kissin' 
So open your eyes and you'll see 
What's been there all along 
Letting go (of your feelings) 
With doubt and fear (you don't need it) 
Break the chains on the heart of the soul 
That's been waiting so long 
Repeat chorus
To be alive again 
You're not among the walkin' wounded anymore 
There's a time to fall 
There's a time to rise above it all 
Repeat chorus
To be alive again 
(to be alive again)
