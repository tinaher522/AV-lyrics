<song artist="Journey" title="Never_Walk_Away">
So young in love they couldn't wait
Said their vows, had to run away
Suddenly, they felt their lives had changed
They believed their hearts were strong
Just to find they couldn't get along
The dream they shared had slowly come undone
Will she go or will she stay
Fool herself for one more day
Don't give up
Never walk away
Love's the promise that he made
In his heart it still remains
Don't give up
never walk away
They had to meet somewhere half way
Heart to heart and face to face
Compromise... a price they had to pay
Cared enough to stand her ground
Screamed and shouted till the walls came down
worth the fight to see a brand new day
Will she go or will she stay
Fool herself for one more day
Don't give up
Never walk away
Love's the promise that he made
In his heart it still remains
Don't give up
never walk away
Will she go or will she stay
Fool herself for one more day
Don't give up
Never walk away
Love's the promise that he made
In his heart it still remains
Don't give up
Never walk away
Never walk away ohh
Never walk away
