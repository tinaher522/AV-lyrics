<song artist="Journey" title="We_Will_Meet_Again">
Was it the words she said or was it all in the way in which the lady said them? 
Her eyes that spoke to me were sending my heart a thought so deep I can't forget them 
I guess it wasn't the right time or the place 
For love right then 
But we met destiny, and it sealed our fate 
Chorus: 
We'll me again (we will meet again) 
I know we will (we will meet again) 
On my heart it's written (we will meet again) 
Somewhere, someplace, somehow I'll find her then as I did now... Just for a moment 
And I will hear the wind that told me 
I will return again my love have patience 
Life's a circle, it all comes back around, so until then... 
I'll be waiting for you knowing somehow? 
Repeat chorus 
And if she were standing in a crowd 
She'd be the one that I would find among the faces 
And if the music was too loud 
It'd be her voice that I would hear 
Above it all (we will meet again) 
I know we will (we will meet again) 
I know we will (we will meet again) 
And if she were standing in a crowd 
She'd be the one that I would find among the faces 
And if the music was too loud 
It'd be her voice that I would hear 
Above it all (we will meet again) 
I know we will (we will meet again) 
On my heart it's written (we will meet again) 
From this day till... (we will meet again) 
We'll me again (we will meet again) 
We'll me again (we will meet again)
