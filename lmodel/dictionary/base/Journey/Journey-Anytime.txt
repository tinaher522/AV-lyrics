<song artist="Journey" title="Anytime">
Ooh, ooh Anytime that you want me
Ooh, ooh Anytime that you want me
Ooh, ooh Anytime that you want me to
Ooh, ooh Anytime that you need me
I'm standing here with my arms a mile wide
Hoping and praying for you
Listen to me and enlighten me
I hope that you need me too, 'cause,
Ooh, ooh Anytime that you want me
Ooh, ooh Anytime that you want me
Ooh, ooh Anytime that you want me to
Ooh, ooh Anytime that you need me
Give me all of your sunshine
A spark is all I need
To take away, all of the shadows
Well what more can I say.
Anytime at all
Anytime at all
Anytime at all
