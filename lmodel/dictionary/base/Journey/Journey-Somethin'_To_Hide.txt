<song artist="Journey" title="Somethin'_To_Hide">
Please come talk to me
Tell me what's on your mind
You say there's nothin' wrong
I know
It's been a long long time
Since I last saw your face
Traces in my mind, I know
You've got somethin' to hide
That you're not telling me
You got somethin' to hide
And I know
Well there's something about you and I know
That you're not telling me
