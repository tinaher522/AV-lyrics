<song artist="Journey" title="Dead_Or_Alive">
A double secret agent
And he was paid to kill
With cold steel magnum force is how the man possessed the skill
He shot a man in Paris
He did a job in L.A.
And if the price was right, he'd surely
Take your life away
Wanted, dead or alive, blood for money, money
Assault, homicide, blood for
money, money, money, money
Wanted
He drove a Maserati, lived up in the hills
A cat with nine lives that's gone
Too far to feel the chill
He never though it'd happen
It was his last mistake
'Cause he was gunned down by a
heartless woman's 38.
(chorus)
