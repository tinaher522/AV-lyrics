<song artist="Journey" title="Lifetime_Of_Dreams">
From the first day...I envisioned myself with you
It's so hard to wait...But with you it was easy to do
Somewhere in time...
I knew I would find you here with every passing moment
I see forever so clear
Part of me was lost without you
You are where I found my faith
Feels like love is here to stay...
Chorus:
When I look in your eyes baby
I see a lifetime of dreams come true
And I want you to say, that you feel the same way too
The stars in your eyes tell me
All my tomorrows will wait for you
You're all of my prayers answered
My one saving grace is you...
In another life...I believed that I loved you then
If lightning strikes twice, we are destined together again
We don't have to make a promise, we were always meant to be
It's written in the way you look at mel...I see
(Repeat chorus)
Love moves at the speed of light
Takes years to get it right
But we've got till the end of time
I can see...I can see...You and me, forever
You're the one woman that can make me stay
My one and only saving grace
(Repeat chorus)
I can see...I can see
You and me, forever
I can see...I can see
You and me, forever
