<song artist="Journey" title="Precious_Time">
I was captured by the light of a wayward smile
When she said to me,
"Move slowly son and touch the sky,
Very soon you'll see
Oo, how precious time placed it's hand on me;
Oo, how precious time, how it rescued me."
See the line of sight in side your mind,
but from where I don't know.
And the tales that are left behind,
Left for all to grow.
Oo, precious time placed it's hand on me;
Oo, precious time, how it rescued me."
Oo, how it rescued me, how it rescued me.
Oh, there's a place in time not far from here,
A place we all could see;
So if you're lookin' for a better day,
Touch the sky and see.
Oh, precious time placed it's hand on me;
Oh, precious time, how it rescued me.
Be the soldiers for your lives my friends,
Fight for all to see.
It's the only way to catch the sun;
It's the only way you'll see,
Oh how precious time placed it's hand on me,
Yeah precious time
How it rescued me, baby, baby it rescued me.
Oh, there's a place in time not far from here,
A place we all could see;
So if you're lookin' for a better day,
Touch the sky and see.
Oh, precious time placed it's hand on me;
Oh, precious time, how it rescued me.
