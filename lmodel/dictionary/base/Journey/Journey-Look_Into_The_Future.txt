<song artist="Journey" title="Look_Into_The_Future">
Look into the future where would it be
Space between the lives whatever will I see yah
How long will I wander before I really know
What I'm here to do and where I have to go
Guess I'm coming home
Yeah you know I'm coming home someday
You know I'm coming home
I'm coming home some way
There you are my shining start
Can you remember who you are
The role that you play from day to dayayayay
You know it's not know it's not the only way
Still I'm coming home
Yeah you know know I'm coming home someday
The futures brighter now it's not so far away
dodododododododododo
Guess I'm coming home I'm coming home some way
But still I'm coming home,
Yeah you know I'm coming home someday
The futures brighter now it's not so far away
It's right around the corner
Just around the corner, oh no
Just around the corner, oh no no no ho
Just around the corner, oh no no
Just around the corner, yeah
