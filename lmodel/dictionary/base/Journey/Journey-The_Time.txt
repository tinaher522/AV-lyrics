<song artist="Journey" title="The_Time">
Woman...there's more to love than meets the eye
There's more to a sunrise than a simple ray of light
Moments...pictures frozen deep in time
A life full of memories that our feelings can't define
How can you ever put your heart before the hurt
Use every moment for all it's worth
Sundown...it's another moonlit sky
For millions around the world it's just another lonely night
How long has it been since you felt the love
You gave up on counting days
To count the days since you gave up
Stand in a sun shower...after all it's only rain
And let it wash away the pain
All we need is the time
Love's gonna come around
All we need is the time
It's all we need babe
Time you lost
Time you found
Time it makes the world go round
Time enough to change your mind
All we need is the time
It's all we need babe
The long summer nights lasted forever...
In the twilight they don't seem so long
But time can't erase every smile on every face...
Like a thief in the night time is gone
Woman...there's more to love than meets the eye
There's more to a sunrise than a simple ray of light
Love's gonna come around
It's all we need babe
Time can heal
Time can mend
In time you'll even love again
Time can make it all seem right
All we need is the time...in your darkest hour
All we need is the time...oh you need a change
All we need is the time...time, time, time
Time can heal...time to mend...time to even love again
Time where you can make things right
All we need is the time...love is gonna come around babe
All we need is the time...oh love is gonna come around...
All we need is the time...say it again
Time it heals...time you found...
Time it makes the world go round
Time enough to change your mind
Time you lost
Time you found
Time it makes the world go round
Time is always on my mind
All we need is the time
