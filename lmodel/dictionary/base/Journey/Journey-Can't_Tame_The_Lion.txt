<song artist="Journey" title="Can't_Tame_The_Lion">
In the midst of a dream I swear I saw you
Standing there 
In a sea of emotion with faithful devotion
You were there 
In heat of the night under the street lights
Once again 
At the edge of the fire for the love of the jungle
Again and again, oh yeah 
They can't tame the lion 
Can't tame the lion 
They can't tame the lion 
One night in Detroit, yes I swear I saw you
Standing there 
In a summer of dreams down by the river
You were there 
I remember, it's all so clear 
In the midst of a dream, yes I swear I say you
Standing there 
They can't tame the lion 
Can't tame the lion 
They can't tame the lion 
In the midst of a dream I swear I saw you
Standing there 
In a sea of emotion with faithful devotion
You were there 
I remember, it's all so clear 
In the embers of reckless years 
In the midst of a dream I swear I saw you
Standing there 
They can't tame the lion 
Can't tame the lion 
They can't tame the lion 
At the edge of the fire, for the love of the jungle 
They can't tame the lion 
Can't tame the lion 
They can't tame the lion
