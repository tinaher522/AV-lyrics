<song artist="Journey" title="To_Play_Some_Music">
Say everybody and everyone
We've been waitin', so very long
To play some music and have some fun
Bring some happiness to everyone
Well come with us and try and learn what's on your mind
Open your ears and eyes and let's see what you can find
You're not so different, I don't mean to be unkind
Something's unfolding if you really take the time, Lord
So let the sun shine it's just begun
You've given all you could to anyone
Well don't you lose it, don't run away
It's getting stronger, day after day
You're sittin' there, you say you're waiting for the show
And what you have, and what you hear is what you really want to know
You've only come here 'cause there's nowhere else to go
We're only sorry, that we have to end the show.
Play some music
Play some music
Play some music
Play some music
Play some music
Play some music
Play some music
Yeah
