<song artist="Journey" title="Here_We_Are">
When you give your all 
And you're feeling small, don't you cry
If you're crying loud,
You won't feel so proud, don't you cry.
There's a place to be 
won't you stay with me 
you can't help, but see
Here we are.
Let yourself go by,
You can touch the sky
If you try.
All you've got to show 
You may never know, what you are.
If you ever try, 
Can you tell me why, why you are.
Only you will know 
And you picked your show.
Can you tell me though, 
Will you know?
If you feel like me 
You can't help but please 
Who you know.
If you're feelin' low, 
Will you tell me though, who you are.
Only you will know
And you picked your show
Can you tell me though, 
Will you know?
If you feel like me 
You can't help but please 
Who you know.
