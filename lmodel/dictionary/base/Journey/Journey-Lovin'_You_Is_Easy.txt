<song artist="Journey" title="Lovin'_You_Is_Easy">
I know you've got that special something
Oh, baby
I know you like to keep it hummin'
Oh, baby
'Cause girl, lovin' you is so easy
Oh, whoa, whoa, lovin' you is so easy.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Come on girl, give me that good lovin'
Oh, baby
Come on girl, keep the motor hummin'
Oh, baby
'Cause lovin' you is so easy
My, my, my, my
Lovin' you is easy (Lovin' you is easy)
Girl, after the mornin' sunlight
After the band has flown away
Oh, we'll be thinkin' of you
Yes, we'll be holdin' on girl
(Lovin' you is easy)
Oh, I'm lovin', lovin', lovin', lovin', lovin', lovin', lovin' you
Oh, and it's easy (easy)
Oh, I'm lovin', lovin', lovin', lovin', lovin', lovin', lovin' you
Oh, and it's so easy (easy)
