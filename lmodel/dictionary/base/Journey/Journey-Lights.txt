<song artist="Journey" title="Lights">
When the lights go down in the city
And the sun shines on the bay
Ooh, I want to be there in my city, oh
Oh, oh, oh
So you think you're lonely?
Well, my friend, I'm lonely, too
I want to get back to my city by the bay
(Oh, oh, oh)
It's sad, oh
There's been mornings out on the road without you
Without your charms
Oh, oh, my, my, my, my, my, my
(Oh, oh, oh)
When the lights go down in the city
And the sun shines on the bay
Ooh, I want to be there in my city, oh
(Oh, oh, oh)
When the lights go down in the city
And the sun shines on the bay
Ooh, I want to be there in my city, oh
(Oh, oh, oh)
Mm
(Oh, oh, oh)
