<song artist="Journey" title="I'm_Gonna_Leave_You">
Pretty lady make me crazy
Come stay with me a while 
Want to know where time begins, yeah 
Your life is shown through your smile 
Take it easy, pretty lady
My meaning's very clear
The summer's gone
And it's gettin' cold, babe 
When you call my name I won't be here 
You know, I'm gonna leave you babe 
And you know that I'm gonna leave
Yes I am 
From a corner light
You call from the dark of night 
Sounds so easy for you to please me, babe 
And it sounds so right 
Another night, another night to spend together
You’re makin' love all the while 
Oh, it's really, really not make believe 
When you touch that desert sky 
You know I'm gonna leave you babe 
And you know I'm gonna leave, leave, leave, leave 
And you know I'm gonna leave 
You know, yeah, babe, I'm gone 
Alrighty drop down!
Now you’re struttin' before the sun 
Can't you feel the flame?
You've been wastin', wastin' precious time 
It'll never be the same 
Now your head, now your head is pounding 
The night is cold and blowing rain 
The search is what a shadow you been missin' 
One you'll never see again 
You know I'm gonna leave you babe 
And you know that I'm gonna leave 
And you know that I’m gonna leave
You know, yeah, babe you know
