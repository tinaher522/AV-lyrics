<song artist="Journey" title="If_He_Should_Break_Your_Heart">
Please be wrong
Please don't tell me it's really you
Tell me eyes...tell my heart what I'm going through
I believed, I believed I was over you
If he should break your heart
I'll always know where you are
If you should fall..apart
I'll be there, I'll be around
If he should break...your heart
I'll be there
Is this right
I don't care, I'm alone with you
Here we are, once again you've got someone new
Lonely hands, please don't do what you wanna do
If he should break your heart
I'll always know where you are
If you should fall...apart
I'll be there, I'll be around
If he should break.... your heart
From my soul I say....good bye yesterday
On more night alone...without the touch...of you
Then I start to break...is it my mistake
Tell me am I wrong...for holding on to you
If he should break your, if he should break your,
If he should break your heart
If he should break your heart
I'll always know where you are
If you should know where you are
If you should fall...apart
I'll be there, I'll be around
If he should break your heart
I'll be there
If he should break your, if he should break your,
If he should break your heart
I'll be there, I'll be around
