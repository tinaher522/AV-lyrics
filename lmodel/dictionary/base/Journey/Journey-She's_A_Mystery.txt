<song artist="Journey" title="She's_A_Mystery">
Cascades of gentle touch,
Her passion blinding my eyes
I'll find, I'll lose myself
Drawing from her colorful sky
I'm aware of her grace,
Those careless kisses
Tattered on a sacred place,
She's a mystery
(She's mine)
Wonderin' if she loves me
She's a mystery
(So fine)
She's a sweet confusion
She's my zen, my home
My only Shangri-La
She's my fave champagne
She's my uh-la-la
Tattered on a sacred place,
She's a mystery
(She's mine)
Wonderin' if she loves me
She's a mystery
(So fine)
She's a sweet confusion
Like a gentle wind she moves
Her fascination I desire
She's a butterfly
She's a Mona Lisa smile
Tattered on a sacred place,
She's a mystery
(She's mine)
Wonderin' if she loves me
She's a mystery
(So fine)
She's a sweet confusion
I'd give all the time
If she's feeling so fine, yeah
In and out of my life
She's a mystery, yeah
