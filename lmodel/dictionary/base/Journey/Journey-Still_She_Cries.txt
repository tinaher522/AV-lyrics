<song artist="Journey" title="Still_She_Cries">
Tears that she kept from me
Somewhere theres broken dreams
Where love once used to be
All in a memory
With time we are forgiven
In time we will forget
I hear her voice in the night
Cries of joy
We were good... good...good...
I still recall how wed touch, how wed fall
We were good... good... good...
Tears that she kept from me
Someone she used to be
Forever yours then suddenly
One kiss she cant remember
I wish I could forget
I hear her voice in the night, cries of joy
We were good... good... good...
I still recall how wed touch, how wed fall
We were good... good...good...
Still she cries
Somewhere... still she cries
No one knows when lovers will walk away
I hear her voice, in the night
Cries of joy...
We were good... good... good...
All in a memory
Where our love once used to be
Good... good...
