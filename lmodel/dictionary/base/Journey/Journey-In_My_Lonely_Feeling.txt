<song artist="Journey" title="In_My_Lonely_Feeling">
In my lonely feeling
From my darkest dreams,
I go on through days as I wonder,
Always changing, forever dreaming
Am I the master of my soul?
Now my reason's changing.
Fear has faded away.
No more days of my wonder,
Can't stop feeling,
No disbelieving,
Yes, I'm the master of my soul.
