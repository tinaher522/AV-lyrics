<song artist="Journey" title="Hustler">
I get beside women all men desire,
Crazy with passion I'll never be tired,
Money's no good to me 'cause lovin's my game,
I don't need no trouble and I'll show you no pain.
I move like a lover, so silent and swift,
Screamin' women love me, just can't resist
I can't be bought, your payoff's no good,
So lock up your women, like you know you should.
