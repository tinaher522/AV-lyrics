<song artist="Journey" title="When_You_Love_A_Woman">
In my life I see where I've been 
I said that I'd never fall again 
Within myself I was wrong 
My searchin' ain't over...over 
I know that
When you love a woman 
You see your world inside her eyes 
When you love a woman 
You know she's standin' by your side 
A joy that lasts forever 
There's a band of gold that shines, 
Waiting somewhere... oh oh yeah 
If I can't believe that someone is true 
To fall in love is so hard to do 
I hope and pray tonight 
Somewhere you're thinkin' of me girl 
Yes I know...I know that
When you love a woman 
You see your world inside her eyes 
When you love a woman 
You know she's standin' by your side 
A joy that lasts forever 
There's a band of gold that shines 
Waiting somewhere...oh 
It's enough to make you cry
When you see her walkin' by 
And you look into her eyes
When you love a woman 
You see your world inside her eyes 
When you love a woman 
Well you know she's standin' by your side 
A joy that lasts forever 
There's a band of gold that shines 
When you love a woman
When you love a woman 
You see your world inside her eyes
