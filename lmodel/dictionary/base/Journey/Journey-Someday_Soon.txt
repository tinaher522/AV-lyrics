<song artist="Journey" title="Someday_Soon">
Someday soon, someday soon. 
Seasons were made for the change. 
You will be there. 
Just like the night to the day without a care. 
The dark goes before the dawn. 
Open up your eyes. 
Someday soon 
Ooo, there'll be a better day. 
And someday soon, 
Yes, it's not too far away. 
Someday soon 
Oo yeah, with open skies, 
And someday soon. 
All we can do is try. 
The coloudest day comes around, 
You will be there. 
All of the feelin's you've found, without a care. 
So my friends, you take a look. 
Don't you look too far. 
Someday soon 
Oo yeah, with open skies, 
And someday soon. 
All we can do is try. 
Someday, someday, someday soon, 
Someday, someday soon 
Someday, someday soon 
Someday soon 
Someday soon 
Someday soon
