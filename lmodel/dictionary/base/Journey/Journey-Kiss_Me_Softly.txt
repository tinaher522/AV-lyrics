<song artist="Journey" title="Kiss_Me_Softly">
There's a state of grace that happens every day 
It's a feeling I thought lost of locked away 
Another question to an answer that I know 
Oh, are you coming home, coming home for sure 
I'd walk a thousand miles, just to hear you calling out my name 
Chorus: 
Kiss me softly kiss me slowly 
I get lost in you like only lovers do 
Hold me closer love me tender 
I get swept away like only lovers do 
You've awakened something deep inside my soul 
And every moment, every breath I feel it more 
Your hidden treasures that you keep down deep inside 
We make love freely as we watch the new sunrise 
I'd live a thousand lives if every one I loved could be with you 
Repeat chorus 
I'd live a thousand lives 
If every one I loved could be with you... 
Repeat chorus 2x 
Only lovers, only lovers, only lovers do 
Only lovers, only lovers, only lovers do 
Only lovers, only lovers, only lovers do 
Only lovers, only lovers, only lovers do
