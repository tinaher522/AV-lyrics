<song artist="Journey" title="Destiny">
Destiny, destiny, just to fly away...
A lonely boy and two lonely girls
Set sail today in search of gold and pearls,
To carry on with happiness in worlds apart,
Destiny with broken hearts,
Fly away...
Love and hate crossing in the way
To somewhere new, somewhere far away...
To carry on with happiness in worlds apart,
Destiny with broken hearts
Fly away...
