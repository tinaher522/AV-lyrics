<song artist="Journey" title="She_Makes_Me_(Feel_Alright)">
Hear what I'm saying, you're losing control
Can't take the sun from her eyes
She's built for comfort, she ain't no fool
She said, take a look, it's easy tonight
It's gonna be alright
She make me feel alright
Baby, baby, baby, baby, feel alright
Yeah, it's gonna be alright
A flaming sky sure makes her look good
You'll put your life on the line
Are you gonna stay, or do you wanna leave
Well hey, come with me, we'll have a good time
It's gonna be alright
Yeah, she make me feel alright
Baby, baby, baby, baby, feel alright yeah
Yeah, it's gonna be alright
I can't wait, I gotta have her now
I can't wait, well, my love is growing stronger, yeah
I can't wait, no, no, no
Things are gonna be alright, be alright, it's alright
Baby, baby, baby, baby
She make me feel alright
Yeah, she make me feel alright
Well, baby, baby, baby, baby feel alright
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby feel alright, yeah
It's gonna be alright
She make me feel alright
She make me feel alright
