<song artist="Journey" title="Human_Feel">
In a jungle of hardware and mass frustration,
Overloaded with way too much information these days
I'm needing more than the virtual world I'm seeing
Could someone just let me talk to a live human being?
While automation and droids just keep on coming,
Wanna unplug right now, wanna just start running
Caught up in the web as it weaves an illusion,
A network of lies that giant ball of confusion
What I'm missing is true emotion,
I get lost in this digital ocean
What I'm needing right now is human feel
Can't substitute love and passion
Show me you care, baby show me reaction
Coming straight from the heart, it's human feel
Rise up, find some compassion,
It's not too late
Don't give up,
What you feel it still matters, don't wait
Make it real, keep it real, human feel
Show me reaction, don't wait
Can't substitute love and passion
Show me you care, baby show me reaction
Coming straight from the heart, it's human feel
Rise up,
Find some compassion right now
Don't give up,
Show me reaction, don't wait
Rise up
Make it real
Make it human feel
Rise up
Oh, rise up
Rise up
Make it real
Make it human feel
Rise up
Oh, rise up
Rise up
Rise up
Oh, rise up
Rise up
