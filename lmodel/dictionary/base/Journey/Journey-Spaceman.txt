<song artist="Journey" title="Spaceman">
Don't be so wise, I was born to fly
Not without a place in the wind
Walked off a cliff, then I closed my eyes
Ooh, I'm not a spaceman, no, no
Ooh, I'm not a spaceman
Don't need no feathers, I don't need no twine,
I'm all together in my body and my mind,
Not supernatural, just a human combine,
Ooh, I'm not a spaceman, no, no
Ooh, I'm not a spaceman!
Can't see a castle, I don't need a sleigh,
I brought my wings, no, not today
I'm a cosmopolitan, right-handed wingless man
Ooh, I'm not a spaceman, no, no
Ooh, I'm not a spaceman.
