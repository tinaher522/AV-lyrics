<song artist="Journey" title="Nothin'_Comes_Close">
Without warning...without tryin'
You walked in from a New York night
Changed my world just in time
Saved my soul and this heart of mine
Are you real or illusion
I can't tell, just say you'll stay
I've imagined, someone like you
Never thought I would see the day
Someone could make me feel, what I had lost so long
Unchain my desire, you are where I belong
I've been around the world, ain't much that I've missed
It don't get much better then this...Oh baby
Nothin' comes close to your kiss
I've thought I felt it all before
One taste and I want more...Oh baby
Nothin' comes close to your kiss
I've had fortune I've had fame
After, you'll never be the same
Never wander I'll be true
On a roll it's because of you
I've been blind now I see
In your eyes is what sets me free
You're the wonder I have found
Hope my feet never touch the ground
On your magic carpet ride
We'll go from dusk till dawn
I know where I'm going now
You are where I belong
I've been around the world, ain't much that I've missed
It don't get much better then this...Oh baby
Nothin' comes close to your kiss
I've thought I felt it all before
One taste and I want more...Oh baby
Nothin' comes close to your kiss
I've been around the world, ain't much that I've missed
It don't get much better then this...Oh baby
Nothin' comes close to your kiss
I've thought I felt it all before
One taste and I want more...Oh baby
Nothin' comes close to your kiss
I've been around the world baby
Nothin' comes close to you
Nothin' comes close to you
Nothin' comes close to your kiss
(Hey yeah, I like the way you wear your shoes
And those red leather pants make me crazy
Yeah baby!)
