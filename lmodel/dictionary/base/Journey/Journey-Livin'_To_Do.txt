<song artist="Journey" title="Livin'_To_Do">
A message comes down... It's a warning 
It's not your time, oh no it ain't but it's coming 
Now what makes us think, we're here forever 
When life is gone, life is gone, before you know it's over 
A church in the rain... A sad congregation 
An old friend I knew 
When I look at the end... I understand now 
I got livin' to do... There's still livin' to do 
With every breath, comes deeper meaning 
I don't wanna waste, I don't wanna waste, one single minute 
Tears fall from the sky, angles are cryin' 
They cry for those... Who don't know that they're dyin' 
I wait for the sun... A chance at a new day 
There's no time to lose 
When I look at the end... I understand now 
I got lovin' to do... There's still lovin' to do 
When I look at the end... I understand now 
I got lovin' to do... 
Whoa... 
There's still livin' to do
