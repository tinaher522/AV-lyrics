<song artist="Journey" title="Like_A_Sunshower">
Girl tell me what's wrong
Are those tears in your eyes
What's going on between us
I'm ready to listen, I don't care if it takes all night
We both said something we didn't mean
We lost our heads, now I can't sleep
Till you talk to me
We find the sun through the rain, caught in a sunshower
We'll be alright, no one's to blame, after the storm we'll shine
So rare you and me disagree, love's like a sunshower
Will you meet me babe, somewhere halfway...yeah
It's been way too long
Since we shared what's in our hearts
Let's say this charade is over
We can't take for granted, how far we've come, lets not lose each other
I know you care cause you stand your ground
When we've talked enough I wanna make up
Wanna make love
We find the sun through the rain, caught in a sunshower
We'll be alright, no one's to blame, after the storm we'll shine
So rare you and me disagree, love's like a sunshower
We won't regret we both get wet
Rainbows wait for you and me, girl we're caught in a sunshower
When we've talked enough 
Can we make up
Can we make love
