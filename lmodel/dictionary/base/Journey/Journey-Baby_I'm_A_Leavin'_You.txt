<song artist="Journey" title="Baby_I'm_A_Leavin'_You">
You know that my heart is true
And I never lie to you
We try each and everyday
Still there's something in the way
I like moonlight, simple things
Now you want a diamond ring
I got news for you
Baby I'm leaving you
We both want a love that last
Girl you're moving away too fast
I live for your fantasy
A real love is what I need
You should be happy, tell you friends
This is where the movie ends
I got news for you
Baby I'm leaving you
Let me tell you girl
I hear what you say, I see what you're doing girl
I don't wanna play
We're livin' in two different worlds
Tell me girl it ain't true
The rumors that I hear about you
About all the boys you knew before
Who come and go right out your door
I like moonlight, simple things
Go out and get a diamond ring
I got news for you
Baby I'm leaving you, baby I'm leaving you
Gone
I got news for you
