Wow
It's all too much for me to see
The love that's shining all around you
It's everywhere, it's what you make
For us to take each other's love
It's all too much for me to see
The love that's shining all around me
The more I am, the less I know
And what I do, is live for love
Hey hey hey hey
Oh, no no no no no
Yeah, hey hey hey
Alright
Wooh, yeah, yeah
It's all too much
It's all too much, it's all too much
It's all too much for me to see
The love that's shining all around you
It's everywhere, it's what you make
For us to take each other's love
It's all too much for me to see
The love that's shining all around me
All the world is built in hate
So take a piece of my true love
It's all too much, it's all too much
It's all too much, it's all too much
It's all too much, it's all too much, wow
It's all too much, it's all too much
It's all too much
Hcum oot lla s'ti, hcum oot lla s'ti
Hcum oot lla s'ti, wow, hcum oot lla s'ti
