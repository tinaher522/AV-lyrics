<song artist="Journey" title="Live_And_Breathe">
I've been waiting for the sky to clear, to get me out of here 
Get me on my way and go I've been waiting for a sign to appear 
To show me the way to a place I've never known 
All I have are my dreams.... 
Your love and blind faith 
There... in the sky spins a wheel, 
It's giving' me the feelin' that my dream came true today 
Chorus: 
There's a place... where we two can be together 
Once the clouds are gone we'll both move on 
In search of all we've dreamed 
There'll come a day... 
Blue skies endless and forever 
Well, that time has come 
I've found the sun in you, I live and breathe 
From the moment that I close my eyes, feel the sun it rise, 
hear it echo through my soul 
For the first time in this young man's life, makes me feel alive 
Fills my heart and makes me stronger 
All I have are my dreams... 
Your love and blind faith 
There in the sky spins a wheel, 
It's givin' me the feeling' 
That my dream came true today 
Repeat chorus
Someplace closer to both our hearts 
Somewhere further than where we are 
Just as long as there's hope enough 
Long as I live and breathe 
Repeat chorus 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah... 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...
