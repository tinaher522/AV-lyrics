Oh, oo.
Oo, baby.
I love cookin' with honey.
I love to make you feel funny.
I love the way you do.
I want, I want it with you, yeah.
Homemade love, Jelly roll love.
Homemade love.
I need a jelly roll sweetie.
Now, spread it oh spread it on me, babe.
Feels so good, on the top.
Spread it around, baby, till I drop ya'.
Homemade love, hot jelly roll love.
Homemade love.
Oh, baby, oh baby,
I know you love it.
Homemade love, oh, baby.
I know you love it.
So love it.
Oh, homemade love, hot jelly roll love.
Homemade love.
Homemade love, hot jelly roll love.
Homemade love.
Oh, baby, baby, baby
Homemade love, hot jelly roll love.
Homemade love.
Oo, smokin',
Oo, baby, you're burnin'
Oo, baby, it's boilin', ah.
