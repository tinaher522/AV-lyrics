<song artist="Journey" title="Mother,_Father">
She sits alone, an empty stare
A mother's face she wears
Where did she go wrong,
The fight is gone
Lord help this broken home
Hey, mother, father, sister
Hey, come back, tryin', believein'
Hey, mother, father, dreamer
Don't you know that I'm alive for you
I'm your servant son
And when lightning strikes the family
Have faith, believe
With dreams he tried, lost his pride
He drinks his life away
One photograph, in broken glass
It should not end this way
Through bitter tears
And wounded years, those ties
Of blood were strong
So much to say, those yesterdays
So now don't you turn away
Hey, mother, father, sister
Hey, come back, tryin', believein'
Hey, mother, father, dreamer
