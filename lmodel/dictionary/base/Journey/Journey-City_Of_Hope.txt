<song artist="Journey" title="City_Of_Hope">
People waiting for some kind of sign from above,
Lost in the shadows of doubt, need a message of love,
Nothing is certain in uncertain times,
Hard to see beyond the greed and the crime,
Oh, the faithful refuse to give up,
Homeless and hungry survive just enough,
Learn to smile through it all,
They are blessed from above
Never stop believin' change will come
There's a city of hope beyond our fears,
Where miracles happen,
Where truth can be heard,
Don't you wanna go to the city of hope
On the edge of the world, across oceans of blue,
It's a place where a dream has a chance to come true,
Don't be fooled by illusions, or falling from grace,
Make your own destiny, find your own place,
Where the streets speak the lessons of trouble, hope and pain
Never stop believin' change will come
There's a city of hope beyond our fears,
Where miracles happen,
Where truth can be heard,
Don't you wanna go to the city of hope
Founded on faith,
Connecting us all,
A network of love to answer the call,
Yeah, that's where I'm from
The city of hope
I hear them whisper, sendin' a prayer,
A cry to the spirit where they no longer wonder
Never stop believin' change will come
There's a city of hope beyond our fears,
Where miracles happen,
Where truth can be heard,
Don't you wanna go to the city of hope
