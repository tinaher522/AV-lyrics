<song artist="Journey" title="Edge_Of_The_Moment">
Blood red sky fades to blue
Miss your touch in shadows I'm waiting
Sweet Memories of holding you near
In your eyes anticipating
One embrace and two worlds collide
Feel the heat of our sweet surrender
Melt away with me there's nothing else
Time stands still when we are together
On the edge of a moment
Return to forever we knew
We made love over lifetimes
Rapture so rare to be true
I keep holding onto
On the edge of the moment
With you
Letting go all I knew
My heart's racing fast
Not sure where I'm going
Nothing certain there's nothing to lose
You by my side all that I know is
On the edge of a moment
Return to forever we knew
We made love over lifetimes
Rapture so rare to be true
I keep holding onto
On the edge of the moment
With you
Oh, with you
With your sweet love I lose all track of time
'Til I don't know if it's day or night
Before it all fades into the past
Wanna see how long we can make it last
Come a little closer
Into my arms
On the edge of a moment
Return to forever we knew
We made love over lifetimes
Rapture so rare to be true
I keep holding onto
On the edge of the moment
With you
Oh, with you
