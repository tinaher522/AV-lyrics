<song artist="Journey" title="Do_You_Recall">
Do you recall
That lonely summer day
We were together and things got in our way
Well, so you think that it's all over
And you know it's gone to stay
Oh, after stormy weather does the sun shine every day?
Yes, I recall, the things you said that day
You told me that you were leavin'
'Cause we can't go on this way
So you think that it's all over
And you know it's gone to stay
Oh, after stormy weather does the sun shine every day?
Yes, it's the lovin' things
That keep us wondering
Yes, it's the lovin' things
Oh, baby, love
Yes, it's the lovin' things
That keeps us wondering
Yes, it's the lovin' things
Oh, girl, say you'll stay
You'll stay now
You think that it's all over, and you know it's gone to stay
Oh, after stormy weather does the sun shine every day?
