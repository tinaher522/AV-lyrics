<song artist="Journey" title="Of_A_Lifetime">
The mist is slowly lifting
The sound of life misplaced your mind
You're sitting, spellbound throughout time
I hope that you remember what you find
Singin' for the lifetime, yea
You put it down, all that I'm thinking
But take a long and distant search
When all is right you take for granted
You can't look down but you're no worse, no no no no, my my my
My my my my my my my my my
Singin' for the lifetime, yea yea yea yea yea yeah
The countless visions that are drifting
The silver dreams, you hate to lose
There's no harm, we've all been waiting
Well keep your faith, do what you choose
Singin' for the lifetime, yea
