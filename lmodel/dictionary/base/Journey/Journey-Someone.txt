<song artist="Journey" title="Someone">
All alone again tonight
A place you know too well
Guess it's something out of your life
Going through the motions
And you like to say you got burned
Well you're not the only one
You've reached the why I'm lonely
On the streets where you roam
You can go back to where you've been
Are you ready to try again?
Once you let someone love you
You'll find an open door
A place in your heart you've never been before
Believe it's never too late
For someone to set you free
Once you let someone love you
(Someone love you)
(Someone love you)
Commitment's just a word
You could've wrapped your heart around
It's your foolish pride and freedom
Got you standing your ground
The same faces every night
Where you stay it's the closing time
It don't stop the empty feeling
You're just wasting your time
A leap of faith, another chance
What if you can dance?
Once you let someone love you
You'll find out an open door
A place in your heart you've never been before
Believe it's never too late
For someone to set you free
Once you let someone love you
(Someone love you)
(Someone love you)
You can go back to where you've been
Are you ready to try again?
Once you let someone love you
You'll find out an open door
A place in your heart you've never been before
Believe it's never too late
For someone to set you free
Once you let someone love you
(Someone love you)
(Someone love you)
Once you let someone love you
(Someone love you)
(Someone love you)
