<song artist="Journey" title="Girl_Can't_Help_It">
If he could hold her
So close in his arms again
If she could show him
The letter her heart forgot to send
Why
They're living dreams on their own
Ooh, they'll never stop running
The girl can't help it, she needs more
He hasn't found what he's looking for
They're still standing in the rain
He can't help it and she's just that way
And when he calls her
She tells him that she still cares
Under the moonlight
He wonders why she can't be there
Why
Why do they go on alone
When they're missing each other
Girl can't help it, she needs more
He hasn't found what he's looking for
They're still standing in the rain
He can't help it and she's just that way
The girl can't help it, she needs more
He hasn't found what he's looking for
They're still standing in the rain
He can't help it and she's just that way
(Ooh, there's a fire in his eyes for you) 
Don't you know she still cries
(Ooh, do you know she still cries for you)
Fire
(Ooh, there's a fire in his eyes for you)
For you she cries
(Ooh, do you know she still cries for you)
Fire
(Ooh, there's a fire in his eyes for you)
Ooh, nothing stands between love and you
