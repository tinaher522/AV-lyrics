<song artist="Journey" title="You're_On_Your_Own">
Well try to make up your mind
Well try to make up your mind, yeah
Now you're on you're own, 
Now you're on you're own, yeah dont leave me behind
There's a new moon rising on the other side
The other side of you
Talk to yourself and someone else
What you tryin' to do
You maybe will, you maybe won't
It's all for you to say
You say you do, and then you don't
It's only you in the way, yeah yeah 
Now you're on you're own, dont leave me behind
Hey, now you're on you're own, yeah
When the light is gone that left your eyes
I haven't spoke too soon
And now we know your spoken words
Is just another tune
You spoke your mind, you've been so kind to me
It's all according to you
Well go inside, keep your pride
I can't get through to you, no no no
Now you're on you're own
Now you're on you're own, dont leave me behind
Well try and make up your mind, dont leave me behind
