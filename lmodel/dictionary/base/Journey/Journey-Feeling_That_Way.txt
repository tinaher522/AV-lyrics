<song artist="Journey" title="Feeling_That_Way">
Opened my eyes to a new kind of way
All the good times that you saved
Are you feeling,
You feeling that way too
Or am I just,
Am I just a fool
When the summer's gone
She'll be there standing by the light
Once she's been to where she's gone to
She should know wrong from right
Is she feeling
Are you feeling
You feeling that way too?
Or am I just 
Am I just a fool
A new road's waiting, you touched my life, whoa
Soft and warm on a summer's night
You're the only one, i told you, the only one I love
The lovely one, I'm thinking of
When the summer's gone
She'll be there standing by the light
Once she's been to where she's gone to
She should know wrong from right
Is she feeling
Are you feeling
You feeling that way too?
Whoa, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, you feeling that way too?
