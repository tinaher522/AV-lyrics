<song artist="Prince" title="The_Love_We_Make">
Desperate is the day that is 2morrow
4 those who do not know the time has come
2 whip the dogs that beg, steal, or borrow
From a table God set 4 his Son
Wicked is the witch that stands 4 nothing
All the while watching 2 c u fall
Deeper than the ditch that bred ur suffering
Is the 1 being dug right now by them all
Happy is the way 2 meet ur burdens
No matter how heavy or dark the day
Pity on those with no hope 4 2morrow
It's never as bad as it seems
'Til we say
Precious is the baby with a mother
That tells him that his Savior is coming soon
All the believers will cleanse
And purify themselves
Put down the needle
Put down the spoon
Put down the needle
Put down the spoon
Sacred is the prayer that asks 4 nothing
But seeking 2 give thanks 4 every breath we take
Blessed r we inside this prayer
4 in the New World, we will b there
The only love there is is the love we make
The only love there is is the love we make
The only love there is
The only love there is
The only love there is is the love we make
