<song artist="Prince" title="Funky_Design">
Just when U thought it was safe 2 go outside
I hit your ass with another funky design
And it's real good
U thought it wasn't when U shoulda
Checked yourself before U got another foot in your ass
And now it comes 2 pass another phat shot from the higher class
That's right, U're still a rookie, see
Kickin' it with the grown folks in the wrong key
Honey please, U need 2 find
Somebody that'll hip U 2 the funky design
CHORUS:
The funky design
The funky design
The funky design
Shouts out 2 the rookies, put it in the bank
And let it gain a cent or 2 until it just stanks
And flows, your nose will know
When it's all wrinkled, then it's good 2 go
On the fire, I would be a liar
If I didn't say I wanna take U higher
And hip U 2 the one-eyed bass
Listen 2 the solo while it pleads my case
Honey please, U need 2 find
Somebody that'll hip U 2 the funky design
CHORUS
And just when U thought it was over, it started up again
Kickin' so loud that it's sure 2 frighten and win
U try 2 run 4 cover
The girl that U're with wanna be my lover
And the DJ instead of kickin' a favorite tune
Scratches on the record that reverberates the room
Like a train crash, U better save yo' ass
The funky design is back and it's bad
Housequake, oh no, I'll kill
Any rookie dumb enough 2 let that nigga spill
Out any speaker, see?
I'm the motherfucker now and if U please
U need 2 need 2 need 2 find
Somebody that'll hip U 2 the funky design
CHORUS {repeat to fade}
