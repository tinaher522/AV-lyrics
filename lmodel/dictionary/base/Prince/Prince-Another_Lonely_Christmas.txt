<song artist="Prince" title="Another_Lonely_Christmas">
Last night, I spent another lonely Christmas
Darling, darling, u should've been there
'Cause all the 1s I dream about
U are the 1 that makes my love shout
U see, u are the only 1 I care 4
Remember the time we swam naked in your father's pool?
Boy, he was upset that night but boy, was that ever cool
Remember the night we played pokeno 4 money and u robbed me blind
Remember how u used 2 scream so loud 'cause u hated the number 9
Hey, I saw your sister skating on the lake this afternoon
Good Heaven, how she's grown
She swoons the boy skaters, she is so tall
But of all your father's children
All your father's children, baby
U know, u are the finest of them all
U are brighter than the northern star
Last night, I spent another lonely Christmas
Darling, darling, u should've been there
U see, of all the 1s I dream about
U are the 1 that makes my love shout
U see, u are the only 1 I care 4
My mama used 2 say, "Always trust your lover."
Now I guess that only applies 2 her
'Cause baby u promised me, baby u promised me u'd never leave
Then u died on the 25th day of December, oh baby
Last night, oh, I spent another lonely, lonely Christmas
Darling, baby, u should've been there
'Cause all the 1s I dream about
U are the 1 that makes my love shout
U see, u are the only 1 I care 4, yeah
Your father said it was pnemonia
Your mother said it was strep
But the doctor said u were dead and I
I say its senseless
Every Christmas night 4 7 years now
I drink banana daquaris till I'm blind
As long as I can hear u smilin' baby
U won't hear my tears, another lonely Christmas is mine
Yeah, mine, yeah
Another lonely Christmas is mine
Last night, yeah, I spent another lonely, lonely Christmas
Darling, darling, u should've been there
'Cause all the 1s I dream about
U are the 1 that makes my love shout
U see, u are the only 1 I care 4, yeah
Another Lonely
