Uh huh
Npg to the maximum
All the time world wide
96 sound better
Legendary tune
I rock (I rock) therefore I am (therefore I am)
I don't need you to tell me I'm in the band ((...) please)
I rock (I rock) therefore I am (therefore I am)
Right or wrong I sing my song the best I can
I don't need you to tell me what clothes to wear
I don't want suggestions about my hair
If the whole world buys your bullshit I don't care
I'd rather put on something that you won't dare
I rock (legendary to the maximum) (I rock)
Therefore I am (therefore I am)
I don't need you to tell me I'm in the band (I don't need it) (no)
I rock
Legendary to the maximum
Npg for now and forever
Welcome to mendacity, sign your name
See the world so pretty, wealth and fame
They can put you on the field (yeah)
But you won't get in the game (wo no)
How many suckers knew that before they came (woo yeah)
Now you know
I rock (I rock) therefore I am (therefore I am) ((...))
I don't need you to tell me (I don't need it)
I'm in the band (legendary all the time)
I rock (I rock) therefore I am (therefore I am) (npg to the maximum)
Right or wrong I sing my song the best I can (show 'em)
Therefore I am
All you mean to npg to the maximum want you to understand somethin'-asta
(come/when) me say (no/love) me say unto another
Watcha them attack each and every vulture
Or do you wants forget that p-r-o starts via pro
Teachin' things in life you'll never know
What for they dabble they don't understandsa
They caught me comin' from the other minnesota
My flava will burn their earsa
Awhen it comes to music this sir is no stranger
Is the same kids you compliment
The same ones that you were meant
To rob an education from
In a private school as opposed to one
That yearly spits out another group of fools
Into a system designed to fail
Wait a minute, I just got some e-mail
Somebody selling 12 cds for a dollar
Make me wanna holler (yeah)
Alright to the maximum
I don't need you to tell me what clothes to wear
I don't want suggestions about my hair
If the whole world buys your bullshit I don't f'in care
I'd rather put on something that world wouldn't dare 'cause
I rock (npg to the maximum) (I rock)
Therefore I am (therefore I am) (legendary)
(I don't need) I don't need you to tell me I'm in the band

Hear me though
Yeah
(rock) make some noise if you're ready
Npg rocks the city
Rugged and raw lift up your bra
Show me your titties
Don't be a dumb son
Grab your condoms and bacardi
Here's car keys, let's party
You fake players walkin' streets in mean mug
I be makin' records gettin' (mmmh) in the hot tub
(rock) in this minneapolis snow I'm fellin'
Ready set to blow up like mt. saint helen
On your cord snorin' your flow borin'
Sort of like channel 5 at 4 in the mornin'
(rock) adult (made under / (...) on the par) give up hope
Grab the devil by the throat
Make him play the scapegoat
(rock) in the runnin' with the bucket of cuttin's
Wishin' I had duckets to live like kirby puckett
(rock) here comes the rumors I'm down with npg
I sign the contract, I'm doing the lp
But woe, what a minute bro' go slow
Ten dollars for the blow, no dollars for the ho'
(rock) in the club trick holdin'
Lookin' for a black magic (woman gang) strong (with/is) dick holdin'
I rock therefore I am (rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock)
I rock therefore I am (rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock)
I rock therefore I am (rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock)
I rock therefore I am (rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock)
I rock therefore I am (rock)
I rock therefore I am (rock)
I rock therefore I am (rock)
I rock therefore I am, yeah
Rock, rock, rock, rock, rock
Rock, rock, rock, rock, rock
