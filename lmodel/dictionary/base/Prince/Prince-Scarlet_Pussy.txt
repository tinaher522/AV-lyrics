<song artist="Prince" title="Scarlet_Pussy">
Once upon a time in the land of fever, there lived a scarlet pussy
This kitty cat of fine descent, was cherished by her mother
Who wouldn't let another, pet her, unless he was qualified
Every 1st of the month this pretty feline got the hots
And that's when the neighborhood (D-d-dogs) 
They'd line up around the block
Meow
When my little scarlet feline roars
The locals come around (Come Around)
When they see the scarlet light
They know it's time to come chase her down (Chase her down)
Lo and behold the fantastical way
In which their bodies groove
My scarlet pussy's furry magic alters any mood
Scarlet Pussy (It's cool)
Scarlet Pussy
Pussycat, pussycat
Wherefore art thou, puppy?
She can make U crazy if U're too close to her heat
She can make U sad when U're happy as can be
She can make U shoot your ego all over her sheets
All is hers in love and war, my little scarlet pussy
Every dog would try his lines
To get pussy's attention ((...))
All they want is so exposed
In ways too gross to mention (Eew!)
Green virgin teenager
A filthy rich yuppie
Pussycat pussycat
Wherefore art thou puppy?
Scarlet Pussy
She can make U crazy if U're too close to her heat
She can make U sad when U're happy as can be
She can make U shoot your ego all over your sheets
All is hers in love and war, my little scarlet pussy
Meow
Now what's going on? 
Oh, no, man, look out!
Somebody come get this meow-meow of my leg!
MEOW!
Scarlet Pussy
Pussycat pussycat
Wherefore art thou, puppy?
Meow
She can make U crazy if U're too close to her heat
She can make U sad when U're happy as can be
She can make U shoot your ego all over her sheets
All is hers in love and war, my little scarlet pussy
All is hers in love and war, my little scarlet pussy
She can make U happy, she can make U sad
She can make U crazy (Crazy)
She can make U shiver from your head down to your feet
She can make U shoot your ego all over her sheets (Oh!)
She can make U crazy if U're too close to her heat
She can make U sad when U're happy as can be
She can make U shoot your ego all over her sheets
All is hers in love and war, my little scarlet pussy
