<song artist="Prince" title="The_Dance">
I don't wanna give U my love
Cuz I don't wanna lose my mind
I don't wanna give U my love
Cuz if I do it's gonna be the last time
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Cuz I never want 2 feel this way again
If I can't be your lover
I don't wanna be your friend, no
I don't wanna be friends, no
Ooh, ooh
I don't wanna hold your hand, no (I don't wanna hold your hand)
Cuz I would just follow U everywhere, oh
I don't wanna see U dance (I don't wanna see U, girl)
Cuz I don't even really want 2 take the chance
Of fallin' in love with U, baby
If U ever said those beautiful words 2 me
"If I wanna be your fantasy," yes
I wanna dance, yes
Let's dance, sugar
Ooh ooh ooh, oh
I don't wanna give U my love
Oh baby, this must be temptation
Cuz I just can't get U off my mind
I try and try
But when I close my eyes
I see U every time
I don't wanna go 2 fast, ooh
Cuz if I do I just might stay (Stay with me)
I'd stay with U baby (Yeah)
I guess I better make it last (Make it last)
The longer that I feel this way (The longer that U feel this way, girl)
Ooh oh
Cuz I never want 2 feel this way again
If I can't be your lover
I don't wanna be your friend, no
I don't wanna be friends, no
I don't wanna give U my love, oh honey, baby (No no no)
Baby, r U gonna really just stand there
And act like U don't want this?
Baby, if U do then U know I just don't care
Oh baby, I could find another
Just like U anywhere
Oh baby, they might not have your hips, girl
And all that pretty hair, oh
At least they won't spend all day in the mirror
Tryin' 2 find somethin' 2 wear
At least, they won't wanna make love
Like U do on the stairs, against the pole on the north corner of the...
Oh baby, baby, baby, baby, it's just not fair
It's just not fair!
Oww!
