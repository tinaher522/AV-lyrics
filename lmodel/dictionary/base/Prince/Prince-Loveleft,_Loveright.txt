{B-side of N.P.G.}
The girls of steel, like the way my body feels
they need to put their hands on
but ooh it gets 'em gone
thinkin' 'bout the way things might have been
In another life, if you were my wife
And I don't mean one, but the two of you every night
(ooh)
Lord knows I'll do my best
I mean it'd be a test
baby in the middle, baby in the middle, taking all requests
Love to the left of me, love to the right
Come on make a noise somebody
Party tonight (oh yeah!)
Love to the left of me, love to the right
Come on make a noise somebody
Party tonight (oh yeah!)
The girls of soul, like the way my booty goes,
they say the curves deserve another glance
come on pretty baby give me a chance
to prove my brotherhood
I'll make you real good
I'll do ya, I'll do ya
I'll do ya like you wanna should
Lord knows I'll do my best
I mean it'd be a test
baby in the middle, baby in the middle, taking all requests
Love to the left of me, love to the right
Come on make a noise somebody
Party tonight (oh yeah!)
Love to the left of me, love to the right
Come on make a noise somebody
Party tonight (oh yes!)
I can't help it baby, it really gets me going
I think about the 3 of us g-going on
A notion of the ocean
love love lovelovelovelove
Love to the left of me, love to the right
Come on make a noise somebody
Party tonight (oh yeah!)
Love to the left of me, love to the right
Come on make a noise somebody
Party tonight (oh yeah!)
Love
Lord knows I'll do my best
I mean it'd be a test
baby in the middle, baby in the middle, taking all requests
Love to the left of me, love to the right
Come on make a noise somebody
Party tonight (oh yeah!)
Love to the left of me, love to the right
Come on make a noise somebody
Party tonight (oh yeah!)
I can't help it baby, it really gets me going (love to the left of me)
I think about the 3 of us g-going on (love to the left of me)
The notion of the ocean (love to the left of me)
Sailing under me (love to the right)
It's enough to make a man want to marry
And I don't mean one,
but the two of u's, naturally (love to the left of me)
(love 2 the right
(Come on make a noise pretty baby let's party tonight, allright)
Party tonight (oh yeah)
Party tonight (oh yeah)
Party tonight (oh yeah)
Party tonight (oh yeah)
Party tonight (oh yeah)
Party tonight (oh yeah)
Party to-party tonight
Party tonight (oh yeah)
Party tonight (oh yeah)
Are there really angels?
or are they just in our minds?
It all comes out in the wash...
...in time
