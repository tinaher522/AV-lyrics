<song artist="Prince" title="Dj_Gets_Jumped">
(this is what it's like in the dream factory, oh!)
(dj brother jules on the wheels of steel, we in the house) (oh shit!)
F**k that!
Excuse me (oh no!)
F**k this disco!
Get'em babies! (they didn't steal)
Spin this muthaf**ker!

Record-spinnin'? (oh!)
Kick his ass! (oh!)
Don't y'all wanna hear some real music? 
Ain't y'all tired of this record-spinnin' bullshit? (man, I'm tired of u)
(oh shit!) (oh!)
Yo, check this shit out!
