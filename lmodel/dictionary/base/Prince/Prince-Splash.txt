<song artist="Prince" title="Splash">
I called you on the phone
You knew it was me all along
You didn't even say hello 
Cause you don't need words to let me know
All the things that you do to me 
You fulfill my every fantasy 
Splash - I'm under your power
Splash - I could go for hours 
Splash - You could devour me
And I'd only want you more 
Oh, when you make love to me
There's things I never thought I'd see 
I cherish (...)
(...) in every sea
Oh, I love when you play with me
Ask your mom if you could stay with me 
Splash - I'm under your power
Splash - I could go for hours 
Splash - You could devour me
And I'd only want you more 
Our love is a rhythm
Together we'll have so much fun 
You go from room to room
Leaving traces of your sweet perfume
If I could I'd bottle it 
Everybody should know the feelin' I get
When I'm in your cool embrace
Your lips, your arms, your legs, your face 
Splash - I'm under your power
Splash - I could go for hours 
Splash - You could devour me
And I'd only want you more 
I want you more and more and more 
Splash
Splash
Splash
Splash
Splash
Splash.
