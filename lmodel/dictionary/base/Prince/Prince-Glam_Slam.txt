<song artist="Prince" title="Glam_Slam">
This thing we got - it's alive!
It seems 2 transcend the physical
One touch and I'm satisfied
Must be a dream it's so magical
CHORUS:
Glam Slam - thank U, ma'am
U really make my day
Glam Slam - thank U, ma'am
I pray U'll always stay
I know I hold U 2 tight (2 tight)
But I just can't seem 2 get close enough (I want 2 hold U)
Want 2 hold U every night (Wanna hold U every night)
I'm so horny and U're the stuff
CHORUS
Heavy feather, flicka nipple
Baby scram, water ripple
(I don't understand) It means I love U
Come a butterfly straight on your skin
U go 4 me and I come again
Glam Slam - thank U, ma'am
Sun is risen, moon is gone
Soda fizzin' on the lawn
Come a butterfly straight on your skin
Glam Slam
Glam Slam - thank U, ma'am
U really make my day - ha ha ha ha
This thing we got - it's alive! (Alive)
It seems 2 transcend the physical
One touch and I'm satisfied (Ooh, baby)
Must be a dream it's so magical
CHORUS
Glam Slam
U will always stay {x2}
It's all right, it's OK
