<song artist="Prince" title="Silly_Game">
I never thought U would be the 1
That I'd wanna run 2
I never thought U would be the 1 
That would make me care
And even though you've done me wrong
For some strange reason I can't explain
I get happy knowing U phoned 
Cuz u're voice could kill my every pain
Why do we play this silly game?
I never thought U would be the 1
That I'd wanna give 2
A diamond ring, anything, that U ask me 2
But there U are bragging 2 u're friend
Making up a story that's so lame
That I was down 2 be u're sugardaddy
A one way ticket 2 ghetto fame
Why do we play this silly game?
Every other night U weren't at home
Out in the streets just actin' grown
Never with a bodyguard or chaperone
Then I hear a rumor that breaks my heart
Instead of takin' care of yourself u're tearin' yourself apart
Now why U wanna (why u wanna), why U wanna
Now why U wanna go and do that love?
Why do we play this silly game?
I never thought U would be the 1
That I'd wanna run 2
I never thought u'd be the 1 
That would make me care
No matter how far I run, I'll never be the same 
(I'll never be the same)
In the end, In the end, there's only us to blame
Why do we play this...
Why do we play this silly...
Why do we play this silly game?
Oh.  Oh, oh, oh, ah
Tell me...  why (oh why)
Oh why, Oh why, why, why, why
Why do we play this silly game?
