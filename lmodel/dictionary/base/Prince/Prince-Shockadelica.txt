<song artist="Prince" title="Shockadelica">
Look'it here
(The lights go out)
The lights go out
The smell of doom
Is creepin' into your lonely room
The bed's on fire
Your fate is sealed
And you're so tired
And the reason is Camille-mille
Shockadelica
The girl must be a witch
She got your mind, body, and soul hitched
Shockadelica
You need a second opinion
But she never wears a stitch
So you can't take her home
She got you tied with a golden rope
She won't let you play your guitar
And when you've cried enough
Maybe she'll let you up
For a nasty ride in her shockadeli-car
She'll make you beg (Please) girl
Shockadelica
Got you in a trance
'Cause when this woman say dance you dance
Shockadelica
You need a second opinion
But you just can't leave her alone
As though you got no mind of your own
Shockadelica Shockadelica
Shockadelica Shockadelica 
Shockadelica
The lights go out
The smell of doom
Again is creepin' into your lonely room
Is this a dream
Or is this real (Or is this real)
Or is this just a mirage you feel
Shockadelica Shockadelica
Shockadelica
She must be witch
She got your mind, body, and soul hitched
Shockadelica
You need a second opinion
She never wears a stitch
You can't take her home
Shockadelica
She got you in a trance
When this girl say dance
Baby, baby, baby, you dance (Shockadelica)
You dance, you dance, you dance, you dance, you...
Shockadelica (She must be a witch) {Yeah}
Shockadelica (She got my mind, body, and soul hitched) 
Shockadelica (I need a second, I need a second opinion)
Shockadelica (I just can't leave here alone) 
The lights go out
The smell of doom
Again is creeping into your lonely room
(Is this a dream)
Is this a dream
Or is this real
(Or is it just a mirage) 
Or is this just a mirage you feel
(Is this just a mirage) (Or is it just a mirage)
(Is this just a mirage) (Or is it just a mirage) (Shockadelica)
(Is this just a mirage) (Or is it just a mirage)
(Or is this just a mirage) (Or is it just a mirage)
(Is it just a...)
Shockadelica
