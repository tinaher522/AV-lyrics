<song artist="Prince" title="Just_As_Long_As_We're_Together">
You can live your own life, and I'll live mine - I will never try to keep you down;
And even if I only see you some of the time, I'm just happy when you come around...
And even if the sun don't shine, 
I'm warm enough when you're in these arms of mine...
Just as long as we're together, everything's alright, (Everything's alright...)
Everything's alright... (Everything's alright...) Oh!
There is nothing that will overcome the love we share, nothing that will break us apart;
Girl, I got to always have you in my hair, got to always have you in my heart...
Ooh, baby, your place or mine? 
I'll get the music, baby, you bring the wine...
Just as long as we're together...
(Just as long as we're together...) Oh, girl, there ain't nothin' better...
Just as long as we're together, everything's alright, (Everything's alright...)
Everything's alright... (Everything's alright...) Oh!
Just as long as there is you,
I'll be around doin' what you what me to...
Just as long as there is me,
I'll be around to sing you a melody, sugar...
Just as long as we're together (everything's alright),
Oh, baby, everything's alright...
Just as long as we're together (everything's alright),
Ooh, girl, everything's alright...
Just as long as we're together (everything's alright),
Ooh, girl, everything's alright...
Don't you know there ain't better? (everything's alright)
Really want you, baby, in my life, you know...
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
