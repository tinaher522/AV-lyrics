<song artist="Prince" title="A_1,000_Hugs_&_Kisses">
Ohh, ah, yeah
U work so hard, U really do
I don't think that anyone could work as hard as U
Hot desert sun, U can feel the heat
Every drop of sweat on your brow is well earned so U best believe
(Chorus:)
I got a 1,000 hugs and kisses 4 U when U come back home, baby (Ooh woo)
I got a 1,000 hugs and kisses 4 U when U come back home, baby (Ooh woo)
(Turn the page)
When U give 'em your all, and still it's only second best
U can come and lay your head upon your baby's chest
Every one of your worries (All your worries), all your misery (All your misery)
U can put them in a little boat and ship them off 2 sea
Cuz...
(Chorus)
Ohh, ah, yeah
I got a 1,000 hugs and kisses U when U come back home
Come here!
The world can be, well 2 put it frankly, such a bitch sometimes
Seems like love that lasts 4ever is kinda hard 2 find
Most of the people we know just looking for a reason 2 cry
As long as U got me I got your back and this is why
U work so hard, U really do
I don't think that anyone could work as hard as U
You can lock the door, better turn off your phone 
I'm gonna give U a 1,000 reasons why we need 2 be alone
Baby.  I got a 1,000 hugs for U, 
When U come back home
Oh yeah
I wanna hold U, tie U up in lace
I wanna kiss U, kiss U all over your face
I wanna love ya all, all up and down
Give U love like U never had, blindfold, gagged and bound
Ooh yeah (Ohh)
I wanna love U babe
One time
Two time three time uh
I got a 1,000 hugs and kisses
When U come back, baby
Love you up and love you down
Give you love til you make them sounds
