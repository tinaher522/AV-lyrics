<song artist="Prince" title="2Nite">
2nite
Happy people in the disco light
Dancin' sexy 'cause the music's right
Put your arm around me and hold me tight
There's no tomorrow, there's just 2nite, 2nite
Worked so hard all through the week
I just wanna get off your feet
Hit me back at a quarter to nine
We can jam and have a real good time 2nite
No guns or drugs up in the place
Old school jams put a smile on your face 2nite
No top forty, no one of that junk
I know this dope spot that just plays funk
You know this jam is sure to move the crowd
Everybody's dancin', no posin' allowed 2nite, 2nite
Note to self must avoid broke back busters unemployed
Brothers who call me shawty in the pickup line
And all those who only got one thing on their mind
Happy people in the disco light
Dancin' sexy 'cause the music's right
Put your arm around me and hold me tight
There's no tomorrow there's just 2nite, 2nite, 2nite
Belinda, Bianca, me and you
We can party like grownup folks do
Come correct and I'll give you a chance
Don't ask me for my number just ask me to dance, 2nite, 2nite
2nite, 2nite
Shake your flip side and feel the beat
Wake up the next day in the Palazzo suites
Lay out 'til noon in the desert sun
Don't get mad 'cause we havin' fun
If we gonna party let's party right
No yesterday just remember 2nite, 2nite
