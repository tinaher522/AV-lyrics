<song artist="Prince" title="Supercute">
She arrived on a 74
/About 20 to 11 
She comes to see him, him as in me
She comes to see 
And it's never complicated
Other women cannot fade it 
Whenever I call
She gets dressed up and all
Supercute 
CHORUS 
Maybe it's cause she comes from East L.A.
But every time I see her body on display 
I gotta call her name from the DJ  booth
Strobe light flash and you know the truth 
Baby got game, she'll take your loot
Keys to the crib with no dispute 
See her dancing in her birthday suit - Supercute 
Together we wonder how we got enslaved and why 
(It's time to get freedom for our people)
Jericho falls when we all discern the lie 
Yo, why the man wanna lie?
I look at her eyes go wild, she smiles - Supercute 
CHORUS 
On a dare I wanna see if she will share
The kinda toys she uses when I'm not there 
None at all she swears
I don't care 
(I don't care ) 
I make her buy another one 
And a new dress to wear
(vibrator noise) 
Goes the toy against her curly hair
Now she must confess 
How she really like to play
Or if she don't, I lower the speed 
And bad words she'll say
Tell me how you play, how you play 
Even in her anger she's still
Supercute 
CHORUS 
Shake it around
When you see her dancing in her birthday suit - Supercute
