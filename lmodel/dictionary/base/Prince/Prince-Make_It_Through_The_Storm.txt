<song artist="Prince" title="Make_It_Through_The_Storm">
So now U want 2 leave me, but why U will not say
Then don't tell me why, just tell me that U'll never go away
Oh, don't give up now, girl, we've been through so much more
Oh, can't U see U're the only thing that I'm living 4
The world's a cold and empty place
Without a love 2 keep U warm
Oh, hold me in your arms 2night
Don't U know we'll make it, make it through the storm
Our love is pain and pleasure but I keep holding on
Cuz I never want 2 lose your love, gotta help me make it strong
Just hold me tight, I'm yours 2night, your love will keep me warm
Hold me in your arms 2night, we'll make it through the storm
The world's such an empty place
Without a love 2 keep U warm
Oh, hold me in your arms 2night
Don't U know we'll make it, make it through the storm
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah [x2]
(We're gonna make it, we got 2 make it)
(We're gonna make it) [repeats in BG]
Make it through the storm
The wind, the wind, your heart is so cold
I can make it
Make it through the storm
Your love, your love, your love is pain and pleasure
U, it's U, it's U I'll always treasure
We'll make it through the storm [x2]
