<song artist="Prince" title="Musicology">
Ooh
Funky
Heard about the party now
Just east of Harlem
Dougie's gonna b there
But you got to (call him) call him
Even the soldiers
Need a break sometimes
Listen to the groove y'all
Let it unwind your mind
No intoxication
Unless you see what I see
Dancin' hot n' sweaty
Right in font of me (right in font of me)
Call it what u like
I'm gonna call it how it be
This is just another one
Of God's gifts, Musicology
Gotta keep that party movin'
Just like I told you
Kick the old school joint
For the true funk soldiers
Musicology
Wish I had a dollar
For every time you say
Don't you miss the feeling
Music gave ya back in the day?
Let's groove September
Earth, Wind and Fire
Hot Pants by James
Sly's gonna take you higher
Minor keys and drugs
Don't make a rollerskate jam
Take your pick
Turntable or a band?
Lordy, if it ain't Chuck D
Or Jam Master Jay
Know what? They're losin'
'Cause we got a PhD in advanced Body Movin'
Keep the party movin'
Just like I told you
Kick the old school joint
For the true funk soldiers
Musicology
All right
Hold down, band
Get back, ooh get back
Don't touch that stereo
These are my records
Musicology
Musicology
Everybody get dow
Good
Keep the party movin'
Don't stop dancin'
Keep the party movin'
Keep the party movin'
Keep the party movin'
Just like I told you
Kick the old school joint
For the true funk soldiers
Musicology
Don't touch that stereo
'Cause I got good n' plenty
Of what you need the most
And that's jive
