<song artist="Prince" title="I_Love_U_In_Me">
She took off her dress, and I took a peek
While thunder storm played hide and seek
I begged for a kiss, she gave me 7
Our lips touched and it feel like heaven
Everything I want is what she does to me
She don't blush 'cause she's so damned free
When she makin' love it's like surgery
And she say, ooh
I love U in me
I promised myself not to come until she does
And she took both hands and a liar I was
No man in this world could ever hope 2 last
When my baby down shifts
and starts pumpin' fast
Everything I want is what she does to me
She don't blush 'cause she's so damned free
When she makin' love it's like surgery
And she say, ooh
I love U in me
I love U, I love U, in me
Our bodies sink in a pool of sweat
It's the kind of love that U never forget (Never forget)
With U honey, I'm the richest in the world (So rich)
I don't need money 'cause u're my girl
(Need money cause u're my girl)
Everything I want is what she does to me
She don't blush 'cause she's so damned free
When she makin' love it's like surgery (Surgery)
And she say, ooh
I love U in me
I love U in me
Everything I want is what she does to me
U don't blush 'cause she's so damned free (So free)
When we makin' love it's like surgery (Yeah)
And she say, ooh
I love U in me
