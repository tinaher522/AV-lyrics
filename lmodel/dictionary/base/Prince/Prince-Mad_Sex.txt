<song artist="Prince" title="Mad_Sex">
Man, I ain't got time 4 that girl
Say what? 
Yeah, she always want 2 talk 2 somebody
Believe me, I know her
Yeah
I see u at another party
Dancin' all over the place
Lookin' 4 the perfect body
2 go with the perfect face
Bushy head mulatto breakdown
And your lips got wet 2day (lips got wet 2day)
Same damn bird from london (same damn cuckoo)
Finally had the nerve 2 say (what'd she say? )
(I'll tell ya Â¨c listen)
Chorus:
I used 2 have mad sex in the horny morning
I used 2 have mad sex in the afternoon
I used 2 have mad sex when me and this mulatto go down
2 dirty up another room
Do it till your tattoo's dizzy
And the stud in your mouth turns gold
Till the animal prints u flaunt so lovely
Is full of little bloody holes
Bushy head mulatto breakdown
And your lips got wet 2day
The same damn bird from london

Uh, finally had the nerve 2 say (what'd she say? )
Chorus
Mad sex {x2}
Steppin' up on the others tryin' 2 make a jealous brotha
Get u nothin' but another night of vibration
One nation under your groove and still u can't break my cool
I see u at another party
Once again the talk of the town
Break another heart, u sorry... skench!
One day u're gonna tumble down, down, down, down
(tumble down, down, down)
Bushy head mulatto breakup
And u never really knew my name (what good is time)
What good is time if u take up (what good is time if u take up)
Every day 2 complain? (oh)
Chorus {x2}
Dirty up another, dirty up another, dirty up another room (mad sex)
Oh yeah {x4} (mad sex)
I used 2 have mad sex {x3}
(mad sex)
2 dirty up another room (dirty, dirty, dirty)
Mad sex {x2}
Dirty, dirty
Mad sex {x2}
