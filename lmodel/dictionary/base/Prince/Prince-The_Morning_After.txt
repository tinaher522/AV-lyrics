<song artist="Prince" title="The_Morning_After">
It didn't hit me til the morning after 
All I remember was a kiss and then you were gone 
And then I missed your smile, the sound of your laughter 
And now I'm sleeping on the side you slept on 
At first I felt the only reason you left me 
Was the proposition that I spoke in your ear 
I ain't a doctor but I know this ain't healthy 
Instead of counting sheep, I'm counting tears 
I coulda drove you home but you wouldn't let me 
I didn't care how far, or if it was near 
Ain't tryin' to push you 'cause I know you just met me 
I'm just wishin' that you were here 
I'm not the kinda man that's sad and lonely 
It's just that something tells me your the one 
Even if you love somebody else it's only 
Better if I get the chance the moment you're done 
Please don't tell me that you lost my number 
Just come back over if you don't wanna call 
I've got some music that will make you rhumba 
We can jam baby all night long
