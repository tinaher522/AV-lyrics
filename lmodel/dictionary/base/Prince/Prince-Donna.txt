<song artist="Prince" title="Donna">
Donna, pretty as U can be (So pretty)
Oh pretty Donna, when will U ever see (When will U ever see?)
That U belong 2 another man?
And I believe he'll try 2 keep U anyway he can
Donna, I guess it's not meant 2 be
Donna, pretty as U can be
Donna, when will U ever see (When will U ever see? [x2])
That U belong 2 another man?
And I think he will try 2 keep U anyway he can
Donna, I guess it's not meant 2 ..
Donna, I guess it's not meant 2 ..
Donna, I guess it's not meant 2 be
Donna [x2]
