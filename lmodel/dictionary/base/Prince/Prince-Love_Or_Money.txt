(Love or money) {repeat in song}
Baby, nothing come 4 free now
If U want 2 be with me now
What's it gonna be now?
Is it love or is it money?
Tell me, tell me what's your name?
What's your claim 2 fame?
U see, I don't like silly games
Is it love or is it money?
Tell me what's on your mind?
Are we just makin' time?
Will our spirits rhyme?
Is it love or is it money? Yeah
Showtime, uh
I'm gonna shake my hips 2 the east
Shake my hip 2 the west
Till U make up your mind
That my hip is the best
I said "Uh"
I said baby, let me take U by the hand
Make U understand
That I... I ain't no silly man
Got 2 let me know, is it love or is it money?
Nothing come 4 free now
If U want 2 be with me now
What's it gonna be now?
Is it love or is it money? Yeah
Listen
Talk a little
Take U by the hand
Make U understand
That I ain't no silly man
He was bad, he was fresh
All the women say he was the best
He had money up 2 his neck
But it didn't mean a heck
The boy was in need of some diehard pussy
The kinda drawers that last
Heck-a-buff, good God, I wantcha
Love
Baby, baby, baby...
(Love or the money) {x3}
We could play 4 days
If U get tired, uh, give me that mayonnaise
Revolution, put the groove on the bus
Don't worry about me, don't worry about us
Hey, baby
Hey, what it is
Love or money {x2}
Showtime, uh!
What?
I... I...
Nothing come 4 free now
If U wanna be with me now
Ah, don't get me wrong mama
U, heck-a-buff, I wantcha
U got 2 let me know, yeah
Revolution, put the groove on the bus
Out of town, Lord, don't worry about us
Gimme that, gimme that Vaseline
Oh, got 2 slide, the girls know what I mean
Uh, Lord
Cool, cool, cool, cool
Let it loose, let it loose
What it is
Love
