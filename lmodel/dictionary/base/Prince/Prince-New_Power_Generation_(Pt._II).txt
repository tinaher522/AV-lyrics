<song artist="Prince" title="New_Power_Generation_(Pt._II)">
we r the new power generation) 
Don't pick my apples, don't pick my peaches
(we r the new power generation)
leave my tree alone...leave it alone...leave it alone
(we r the new power generation)
Don't u look at me
(we r the new power generation)
If you're sad and u know it and u think u want to blow it
let your feelings out, love is there
Just go!
Kid! Yo Kid!
I got ta do this, I got the noise, I got ta do this
so pump the big noise, c'mon in the house...
this here rap's about the true confession
if ya listen close u 'bout to learn a lesson
u must know failure before success
now this is the failure I must confess (well...)
I was hanging onto life trying deal with this
playing the games, almost got dismissed
cocaine was the thing that I took on
and nowhere was the place that I was going (preacher, cmon on)
I must tell the truth, I cannot lie
I was headed 4 the kill, steal, destroy, and die
top 2 the bottom 2 bottom 2 top
success is where I'm headed there ain't no doubt
success is something that we all want
but the truth is what we need to reach our point
I had to give this message the so-called truth
I hope it's somthing in it that's there 4 u
{on top of:
love to the left of me, love to the right
come on make a noise, somebody
party tonight! (oh yeah!)}
like I told ya before, I'm a tell ya again
success is something that's deep within
so remember the truth you cant go wrong
the flesh is weak and the spirit is strong
I know it to do this rap, and I know its right
'cause I did it in the name of Jesus Christ
(cmon somebody lets party tonite)
Party tonight! (oh yeah!)
you want me 2 what?? (shake!)
what? (shake! shake!)
awww, right
the New Power Generation has just taken control
