<song artist="Prince" title="Da_Bang">
Say I don't mind
What U do 2 me
If U waste my time
Then it's meant 2 be
I called your number, yes I did
Like U told me 2
Like a puppet on a string
I'm gon' dance and I'mma sing
I will do most anything
If U promise me da bang, bang, bang
Don't wanna lie
I just wanna do it
But some other guy, baby
Has beat me 2 it
But we're in love, well
We're 2 of a kind, yes we are
What good is your body, baby (what good is your body)
Without your mind (without your mind)
Not much
Like a puppet on a string
I'm gon' dance and I'mma sing
I will do most anything
If U promise me da bang, bang, bang
Hit me, niggas
So here's the story
I'm here 4 U
Without the boring
Without the cool
When U try 2 fake it, baby
And U wanna get through (U know what I'm talkin' about)
Like a puppet on a string
I'm gon' dance and I'mma sing
I will do most anything
If U promise me da bang, bang, bang
Bang, bang, bang
Yeah
Ooh
