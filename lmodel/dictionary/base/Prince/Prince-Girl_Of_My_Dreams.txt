<song artist="Prince" title="Girl_Of_My_Dreams">
One, two, three
I want a woman like Marilyn Monroe
The kind of woman that'll never say no
The kind of woman that'll make you scream
That's the girl of my dreams
I wanna woman that'll treat me right,
Give me good lovin' all through the night
take her on a date, she's my machine
That's the girl of my dreams
Oh, the Girl of my dreams,
Oh, listen people, that's the girl of my dreams
I want a woman like Lauren Bacall
Old and wrinkled but knows it all
Got all the little tricks that'll make me cream
That's the girl of my dreams
I want a woman that can wash my hair
Even wash my underwear
Always smilin', never mean
That's the girl of my dreams
Oh, the girl of my dreams,
Oh, listen people, that's the girl of my dreams
I would say that you're a chauvinist
No, I just got a lot of things that are on my list!
Yeah - if she can't hang would you give her the fist (No man)
I'd sit her right down and give her a little kiss!
Oh, I need a woman like Lena Horn
knowed she was funky since the day she was born
Lena's mama say "Doc, is it a girl?"
Doc say "And how!"
Lena smiled, slapped the doctor and said
"Sucker I'm runnin' things now!"
Oh, the girl of my dreams,
Oh, listen people, that's the girl of my dreams
