<song artist="Prince" title="Thrill_You_Or_Kill_You">
Call your ass up on the phone
Your momma tells me U ain't home
What the hell's wrong with U
U must think that I'm a fool
U gotta be crazy 4 playin' with my mind
I could kill U anytime
[Chorus:]
One way or another, girl
I'm gonna make U mine
I'm gonna thrill U or kill U
I'm walkin' the line
One way or another girl
I'm gonna make U mine
I'm gonna thrill U or kill U
I'm walkin' the line
Took U out 2 eat one night
U ate up everything in site
Heaven knows I wanted 2 fight
When all I got was a kiss goodnight
Ooh, what a kisser
Your face could stop a clock
But I still love U, baby
I still wanna bust your clock
Hey, hey!
[Chorus 2x]
