<song artist="Prince" title="The_Ladder">
Once upon a time in the land of Sinaplenty
There lived a king who didn't deserve 2 be
He knew not where he came from
Nor where he was going
He never once said thank U, never please
Now this king he had a subject named Electra
Who loved him with a passion, uncontested
4 him each day she had a smile
But it didn't matter
The king was looking 4 the ladder
Everybody's looking 4 the ladder
Everybody wants salvation of the soul
The steps U take are no easy road
But the reward is great
4 those who want 2 go
A feeling of self-worth (everybody's looking) 
will caress U (for the answers)
The size of the whole wide world will decrease (how the story started)
(and how it will end)
The love of God's creation will undress U
And time spent alone my friend, will cease
Everybody's looking 4 the answers
How the story started and how it will end
What's the use in half a story, half a dream
U have 2 climb all of the steps in between (yeah, we ride)
Everybody's looking 4 the ladder
Everybody wants salvation of the soul
The steps U take are no easy road (the steps you take are no easy road)
(it's not that easy)
But the reward is great
4 those who want 2 go (I do)
everybody... everybody's looking (Everybody's looking 4 the answers)
for the answers
everybody wants to know how the story (How the story started)
started and how it will end (started and how it will end)
What's the use in half a story, (What's the use in half a story)
half a dream (half of a dream)
U, U gotta climb, U gotta climb (U have 2 climb all) 
all of the steps in between (the steps in between)
everybody, 
Everybody's looking 4 that ladder (Everybody's looking 4 the ladder)
Everybody wants salvation of the soul (Everybody wants salvation of the soul)
(salvation)
The steps U take are no easy road (the steps you take are no easy road)
(that's for sure)
But the reward is great (the reward is great)
4 those who want 2 go, (4 those who want 2 go)
those who want 2 go
everybody... everybody wants (Everybody's looking 4 the answers)
an answer
anyone who know how the story (How the story started)
started, how it will end (started and how it will end)
will it be lonely in the world (What's the use in half a story)
What's the use? (half of a dream)
(have 2 climb all) 
(the steps in between)
