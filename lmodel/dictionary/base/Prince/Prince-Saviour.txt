<song artist="Prince" title="Saviour">
How did I ever come this far without u, baby?
What was I thinking?
What was I trying to be?
Never did u ever give me reason to doubt u, baby
U are my destiny and this I truly see
I can see we're like
2 petals from the same flower, baby
We're like 2 branches from the same tree
Whenever I look in ur eyes
I can see a paradise
U're my saviour
U're all I'll ever need
Saviour
I used 2 say no 1 lover could have me
No 1...no
But that was be4 my eyes had seen the light
2 make love with another, un-uh
Couldn't do it no way
U're my saviour
U're the only 1 that does it right
Can't u see we're like
2 petals from the same flower, baby
We're like 2 branches from the same tree
Whenever I look in ur eyes
I can see a paradise
U're my saviour
U're all I'll ever need
What would I be without ur love around me?
What would I see?
U constantly astound me
Saviour...saviour...
Oh, how did I come this far without u, baby?
I don't know
What was I thinking?
What was I trying to be?
Well, why don't u know that we're like
2 petals from the same flower, baby
We're like 2 branches from the same tree
2 drops of water from the same sea
Whenever I look in ur eyes
I can see a paradise
U're my saviour
U're all I...
U're my saviour
U're all I'll ever...
U're my saviour
U're all I'll ever need
U're all I'll ever need
Saviour...u...
U r my flower, baby
Every, every, every hour
Oh yes u r
