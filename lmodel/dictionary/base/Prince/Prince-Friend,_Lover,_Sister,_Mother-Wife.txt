<song artist="Prince" title="Friend,_Lover,_Sister,_Mother-Wife">
If I ever held a hand
It was only because I'd never held ur hand
That was part of the plan
I had 2 get it right
If I was 2 b ur man
And if I ever kissed ur lips
I needed time 2 cross the others off my list
And if I took a trip
I wanted u 2 go
That was my wish, yes it was
My friend, lover, sister, mother, wife
Air, food, water, love of my life
If I ever shared a bed
It was only cause I want 2 live up
2 what the people said
Now I'm living instead
Everyday just to say
U're the only 1 who'se in my hair
Oh yes u r
And if I ever made u cry
All I'd have 2 do is think about it
And I'd just wanna die
How'd I ever make it by without u, baby?
I don't know
I hope I never have 2 try
(Please don't ever leave me)
Oh listen 2 me
Friend, lover, sister, mother, wife
Air, food, water, love of my life
Friend, lover, sister, mother, wife
