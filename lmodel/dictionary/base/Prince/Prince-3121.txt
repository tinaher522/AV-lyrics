<song artist="Prince" title="3121">
(3121 (3121)) {distorted vocals}
1 mix, 1 mix {looped}
DJ, turn it up {looped}
Let's go
3121
Bring mommy, she's local, right
3121, come on
Through the gates, knock on the door
Put your clothes in the pile on the floor
Take your pick from the Japanese robes and sandals
Drink champagne from a glass with chocolate handles
Don't U wanna come? 3121
Gonna be so much fun - 3121
That's where the party be - 3121
U can come if U want 2, but U can never leave!
Look over there (look over there), there's another turn on
Butterflies scared that they're gonna be awake all night long (All night long)
Dancing in your belly like a ballerina
In spite of your efforts 2 calm them down
Don't U wanna come? 3121
It's gonna be so much fun - 3121
That's where the party be - 3121
U can come if U want 2, but U can never leave!
House party, y'all
It's going down people, like the wall of Berlin
Lock the door (lock the door) till U see the sun (Till U see it)
We gon' party like there ain't gon' be another 1
Futuristic fantasy
This is where the purple party people be, yeah
This is where the party be - 3121 {x2}
Breakdown
Guitar!
(3121 (3121)) {distorted vocals}
Don't U wanna come? 3121
It's gonna be so much fun (Yes it is) - 3121
That's where the party be - 3121
U can come if U want 2, but y'all can't never leave! (Not ever!)
It's going down y'all, like the wall of Berlin {looped}
