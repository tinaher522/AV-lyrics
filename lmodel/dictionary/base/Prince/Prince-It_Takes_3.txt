<song artist="Prince" title="It_Takes_3">
[Chorus:]
It takes 3, U and me
And her 2 - tell me pretty baby what U wanna do
I've seen the future, baby, and it looks like U and I
All wrapped up in love that'll never die
Maybe I just want another 2 keep U happy while I'm away
A friend as special as U should never be lonely, a single day
It takes 3
If U ain't got a friend U can't be with me (Hey)
It takes 3
Nothin' I want 2 do will make U uncomfortable, I swear
Wherever my hands go, baby, it'll be cuz U put 'em there
I could be satisfied with talking about all we could do
But I'm wise enough 2 know that's the only way 2 get wit' U
And her 2
[Chorus]
It takes 3
If U ain't got a friend U can't be with me
It takes 3
Check this out
U know my every thought if U think about it long enough
Don't ask me why, nothing's lost if U try
But 2 not, is 2 never know if U and me and her could flow
Let's go, let's go 2 the land of "Yes I will"
G'on put your foot up on that window sill
It takes 3
If U ain't got a friend U can't be with me (Hey)
[Chorus]
Hell yeah, baby
Shake all that
[Chorus]
Girl, U got something the whole world should see
I'm so proud of U
If I can't get a witness who'll believe it's true (It takes 3)
Nobody, that's why it takes 3
If U ain't got a friend U can't see me (It takes 3)
U can't see me
(It takes 3)
Fellows g'on and sing that I'm jettin'
(If U ain't got a friend U can't be with me)
Don't forget your rain coat
