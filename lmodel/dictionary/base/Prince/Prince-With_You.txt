With You 
by Prince
I've held your hand so many times
But I still get the feeling I felt the very first time
I've kissed your lips and laid with you
And I cherish every moment we spend in each other's arms
I guess my eyes can only see as far as you
I only want to be ... with you
We've come so far in so little time
That sometimes I wonder if this is meant to be
Sometimes you are so very kind
That the nights you're not with me I'm scared you're
gonna leave
I guess you could say that I'm just being a fool
But I only want to be ..... with you
