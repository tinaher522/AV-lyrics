<song artist="Prince" title="Prettyman">
Don't hate me, cuz I'm beautiful
Hey now, what's up?
Ah, you know 2 come over here staring at a brother so hard (huh) 
Say U was!
If U wanna be my baby, got 2 tell me so
Overconfident lady, better act like U know
If U wanna be my baby, come on take my hand
Tell me that U wanna get with a pretty man
See me up here dancing, dancing on the floor
Got your little body doin' just a little more
The way I wear my knickers 'round this booty tight
Make a sister wanna call me up every night (hey) 
If U wanna be my baby, got 2 tell me so 
Overconfident lady, better act like U know
If U wanna be my baby, come on take my hand
Tell me that U wanna get with a pretty man
Everywhere I go people stop and stare
They just wanna see me swing this pretty hair
If there ever comes a time it just won't grow
I'll do it like my brother and buy some mo'
Hey!
If U wanna be my baby, got 2 tell me so (tell me)
Overconfident lady (looky here), better act like U know (do ya know?)
If U wanna be my baby, come on take my hand (take my hand) 
Tell me that U wanna get with (say it!) a pretty man (ooh, nah)
If U wanna be my baby (Pretty man)
Ooh! Pretty man (Pretty man)
Looky here now!
In the early morning when I'm feeling nice (Pretty man)
I walk by the mirror and kiss it twice (Pretty man)
When it comes to perfume it's on the shelf
I get it down, if there ain't nobody around, I, I, I smell myself (hey!) 
 
Pretty man, looky here (Pretty man)
I ain't through! (huh) (see) 
Ow! (uh)
Wait a minute
Come on band, break down (Pretty man)
I don't care about money, I buy gold by the ounce
Y2K, not today, I write a check and the bank bounce
Superball used 2 be my nickname
If U ask about love, no money back guarantee when I'm above
Pretty
Man
If U wanna be my baby, got 2 tell me so
Overconfident lady, gotta act like U know
If U wanna be my baby, come on take my hand
Tell me that U wanna get with the pretty man (huh)
Maceo! Brother, can U blow pretty? (Pretty man)
From Harlem (uh, ay) all through Tokyo
Wait - Stop
Go 
(Pretty man)
Ooh! 
Maceo - can ya, Maceo - can U blow?
Hey!

Pretty man (Pretty man)
Ooh yeah!

Can I scream now? 
Ay!! Ay!! (Pretty man)

Ay!! Ay!! Ay!! Ay!! Ay!! Ay!! Ahhhh!! Nah!! Woo!!
