<song artist="Prince" title="Better_With_Me">
This might seem strange
Since so much time has passed
And since only one of us
Still looks the same
Your words not mine, baby
You're still fine yes you are
Like wine, you get better with time
So young and so naive
That I never once believed
That the memory of you would go through
Like wind goes through the trees
Maybe if you believe baby
That I would no deceive you
You and I side by side or somewhere
In between
I don't know if this is a bore
But I just can no longer ignore
This fact so sublime
You get better with time
Anyone who's met you agrees
That no one forgets you most of all not me
You can claim you're humble and hide
But when it's true my dear
It's not pride
A jury of my peers would find me
Guilty of so many crimes
If I chose not to remind you
That you get better with time
This might seem absurd
To someone so cultured
And to one who would grace any stage
When the hair that frames that face
Dark brown or silvery lace
What is age but a cage? Never mind
You'll be blind to not know that you get better with time
