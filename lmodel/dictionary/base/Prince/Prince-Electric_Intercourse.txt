<song artist="Prince" title="Electric_Intercourse">
I feel some kind of love 4 U
I don't know your name
This is the kind of love that takes 2
I want U and I'm not ashamed
Cuz baby, U shock my wild
With a sexual electricity extraordinaire
Come and take advantage and undress me
I don't even know U, I don't even care
I feel some kind of sexual courage
Tell me do U feel it 2?
Our bodies wanna be 2gether
Girl, I wanna be with U
Electric is my body, baby
I'll shock U with my lips
Darling, don't U know
Your Technicolor climax is at my fingertips?
Hear me, baby
Electric intercourse, electric intercourse (Wake up, Wendy!)
Don't U wanna?
Electric intercourse, electric intercourse
Don't U wanna make love, sweet love, my love?
Mash it
Electric is my body, baby
I'll shock U with my lips (Yes I will)
Darling, don't U know
Your technicolor climax is at my fingertips
Baby, no no, listen 2 me
Electric intercourse, electric intercourse
Don't U wanna?
(I say this)
Electric intercourse, electric intercourse
(I say the first intercourse, I say the first one)
Don't U wanna make love, sweet love, my love?
Yeah
Electric intercourse, electric intercourse
Don't U wanna?
Electric intercourse, electric intercourse
Don't U wanna make love, my love, sweet love, yeah?
Don't U wanna?
Electric intercourse
Don't U wanna make love, yeah?
