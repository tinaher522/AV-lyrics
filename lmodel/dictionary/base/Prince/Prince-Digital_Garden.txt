<song artist="Prince" title="Digital_Garden">
Love, like a rose in bloom
And all of the Rainbow Children would feel it soon
2 the east, word traveled about this energy
Until it reached the Banished Ones
Who just wanted this love 2 cease
They now fallen into (Love, like a rose in bloom)
Resistor's dream
And they built a Digital Garden
(And all of the Rainbow Children would feel it soon)
Or so it seemed
In its brilliant darkness
So-called angels of light
Lies {repeated}
And all the Rainbow Children will stand and fight
4 everlasting, everlasting life
4 the one who sits on the right {x3}
4 Him we're willing 2 do the work
"The Banished Ones approaching the palace shouted obscenities.
They tried 2 confuse the Rainbow Children and dethrone their king.
Using the lies promoted by the whosepapers, hellavisions, and scagazines,
The Banished Ones constructed a Digital Garden around the palace
That extended throughout the world.
Furthermore, they demanded compensation 4 their time
spent in the palace before the exile.
This was noise! (Fire, fire!)
"'So be it', said the Wise One,
And gladly obliged with an invisible deed.
The Banished Ones accepted it
and returned 2 their place of birth in Menda City.
As 4 the Rainbow Children, they began deconstructing the Digital Garden.
Door 2 door they went in search of those willing 2 do The Work".
