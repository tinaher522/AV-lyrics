<song artist="Prince" title="A_Million_Miles_(I_Love_You)">
How could I illustrate my love 4 U?
What would U do if U were in my shoes?
Would U climb the highest mountain?
Would U sail across the sea?
If I were a million miles away, would U visit me?
How could I illustrate how much I really care?
How could U do if U were here, my dear, and I was there?
Would U eat a poison apple?
Would U be burned at the stake?
If I were a million miles away, would U visit me?
CHORUS:
I love U a million miles, I love U
I love U a million miles, I love U
If U love me, would U eat a poison apple?
How much would U take?
And would U be burned at the stake?
Where's the dawn?
Darkness is death
Don't die, live 4ever
Say U love him
How could I demonstrate the way U make me feel?
If I walked through fire, would U say my love was real?
U got me crazy, I'd do most anything
If U got in trouble, I'd sell my diamond ring
That's how much I love U, baby, a million miles
CHORUS {x2}
(Somebody, somebody clap your hands) {x4}
Somebody, somebody
A million miles
A million miles
