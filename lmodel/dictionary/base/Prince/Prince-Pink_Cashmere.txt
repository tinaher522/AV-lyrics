<song artist="Prince" title="Pink_Cashmere">
Oooh...
There I go again falling in love all over
Oooh...
The cycle never ends
You just pray you don't get burned
Oooh...
This fire inside of me, don't nobody realize
Oooh...
What u are to me, but baby u got to learn
I'm making u a coat of pink cashmere
U got to know how I feel about cha
How I always want u near
I'm making u a coat of pink cashmere
I'm counting every minute
Of every hour 'til u are here
Girl, can't u understand
I never used to go dancing
I was the kind of man who'd rather stay at home
Now, when I realize how much I miss u
I want to jump for joy and thank Him I'm not alone
I'm making u a coat of pink cashmere
U got 2 know how I feel about u, baby
How I always want u near
I'm making u a coat of pink cashmere
I'm gonna count every minute of every hour
Until u are here
Here I go again falling in love all over
Oh, the cycle never ends
U pray u don't get burned
I'm making u a coat of pink cashmere
(I'm, I'm making u a coat of cashmere,
Baby, cashmere)
U got to know how I feel about cha
(U got to know, yeah)
I'm making u a coat of pink cashmere
(How I feel about u, how I feel about u, oh)
I'm counting every minute of every hour
'Til u are here
When I get my arms around u, baby
There's so many things I wanna do
I'm gonna hold u
I'm gonna kiss u
Like u...like u...
I'm gonna tell u a bedtime story, baby
One u never heard before
I said, one u never heard before
About a girl, about a boy
And all the joy
All the things that u enjoy
I'd stay in love, I'd stay so happy
Baby girl, there's so many things
So many things I wanna do
I wanna...
I wanna...
I wanna...I wanna...I wanna...I wanna...
I wanna make u a pretty, pretty coat of cashmere
Cause u got to know how I feel about u, baby
How I feel about u, baby
I'm gonna make a little pretty coat
I'm gonna count every second, every minute
Each and every hour of every day
'Til u come on back
Come on back to u're little man
