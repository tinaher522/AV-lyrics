<song artist="Prince" title="Others_Here_With_Us">
When I'm alone, my mind takes a drive
Through chocolate religion and spirits alive
All I was brought up in this world 2 know
Is lost when a demon swallows them whole
CHORUS:
There's others here with us
There's others here with us, I know
It's strange how your mind works when Love is in power
One learns 2 care and appreciate a flower
What makes others want 2 change your mind?
All the things I've seen, life is so sublime
CHORUS
7-month-old baby died in her sleep
The parents went crazy and cried 4 a week
They swore they heard her laugh in the crib by the wall
They're convinced she's with us if she's anything at all
There's others here with us
There's others here with us, I know (I know)
Bobby had an uncle who took a string
And wrapped his neck around it, a pitiful thing
If only we can turn back the hands of time
Except there's others here with us, life is sublime
There's others here with us
There's others here with us, I know (I know)
All the things I've seen {x2}
CHORUS
