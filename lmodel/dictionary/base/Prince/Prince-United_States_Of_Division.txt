<song artist="Prince" title="United_States_Of_Division">
2004, still at war and everybody hates Americans
Flyin' in an aero-plane with pen in hand
Over miles and miles of deep blue
Wonderin' if it was all part of a master plan
Forget the 1 and become 2
How could your brother hear the same music? (music, music, music)
Yet somehow dance 2 a different tune
I guess that once you go divide this precious land
This precious land will divide you
Sing!
Doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Everybody stop fighting!
Doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Everybody make love!
Drivin' a brand new Cadillac through my neighborhood
Everything still look the same, uh
Everything except the fact I wish I could
Take away all the hurt and pain
We let Supafly straighten up our curly hair
He took the Afro out the game
It's kinda cool but the guns and drugs 2 much 2 bear
10 years later Scarface came
Sing the hook
Doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Everybody stop fighting!
Doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Everybody make Love!

A united state of mind will never be divided
The real definition of unity is 1
People can slam their door, disagree and fight it
But how you gonna love the Father but not love the Son,
United States of Division
Walkin' down the street
No flag in hand
No stars and stripes
No claim 2 land
No crescent moon
Just a holy man, holy man
How far from heaven must we go?
Before the winds of change will blow and show
This world how it's supposed 2 be, land of PEACE and HARMONY.
Everybody stop fighting!
Everybody make love!
Everybody stop fighting!
United States of Division
People can slam their door, disagree and fight it
But how you gonna say you love the Father &amp; not love the Son?
United States of Division

Why must I say "God Bless America"?
And not the rest of the world
Oh say can you see?
I love my country but I love God more
Every man, women, boy and girl
Oooh, can you say it with me?
Doo doo doo doo doo doo, come on
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo, everybody
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo, oh
Everybody stop fighting! Put your gun down
Doo doo doo doo doo doo, hey
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo, everybody gather round
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Everybody make Love!
Doo doo doo doo doo doo, oow
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo, talk 2 me
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo, what is this rush 2 declare war?
Everybody stop fighting! What we fightin' for?
Doo doo doo doo doo doo, hey
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo, oh
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo, come here baby
Everybody make Love!
Talkin' 2 United States, United States, United States of Division!
Everybody make music
Everybody make love
