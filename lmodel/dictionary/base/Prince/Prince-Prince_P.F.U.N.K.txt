Drop it now 
Gonna stop it now 
Gonna git it now 
Here he comes again 
He's gonna try to ruin my day 
Never had a reason to dog me out 
Di?n't never make 'em do what they say 
Nine times outta ten 
AskÂ ?im if he did he say no 
I'll never be a turncoat 
Never be the one 
To sell your name at the grocery store 
You come around 
Funny stuff be goin? down 
Ask him how it happened 
Yo he don't know 
But I don't care what people may say 
I ain't gon? let it ruin my day 
The best remedie for a basket full of lies 
Is funk 
Ain't nothin? like funky music 
... 
Got to gimme some of that music 
Here she comes again 
She got to tell the story her way 
Once she's caught a guy 
That's doin? somethin? she don't wanna 
Takin? money when the crime don't pay 
Every now and then 
You'll do somethin? ... they said 
One man's justice is another man's fear 
Don't you wish that you could sleep in my bed? 
The only reason to say my name is to get your 15 secs of fame 
Nobody's even sure what you do 
But I don't care what people may say 
I ain't gon? let it ruin my day 
The best remedie for a basket full of lies is funk 
There's nothin? like funky music 
Let the music play 
I'm crazy 4 Cocoa Rock
Uh
Well, it might not be The Grand Progression 
But it sure is funky 
Right on 
Funky music (Ha ha)
Funky music
Funky music 
Like dat keyboard, easy on the keys and easy on the beat)
Right On
Guitar man (Ain't nothing like funky music)
U can do more than that c?mon c?mon (wanna give U some of this music)
Mouth guitar, Mouth guitar
How you gonna cap and be gone? 
I hate to let you know but it's on 
You might not like the taste 
But I'm still gon? stick your face in this funk (stick yo face in it)
Gossip again? 
Ho. Hum. 
Listen to my drum 
Digital music disappears in the daytime 
When I 1st heard 
Yo face 
Listen to my bass 
Time will tell 
We are 
Listen to my guitar 
(Chorus)We don't care what people may say 
We ain't gon? let it ruin our day 
The best remedy for a big, fat punk is funk 
Ain't nothin? like funky music 
Turn the music up 
Are you talkin? to me? 
All right 
Somebody call 9-1-1 
Y?all trippin? 
Look here, Weavalicious 
C?mere?let me talk to you 
You and your boyfriend 
Lemme tell you somethin? right now 
You run up on me again 
With words or otherwise 
And I?mma knock both you punks out 
Okay takeoff
Where da ambulance?
There you have it, world 
That is passing away 
We don't care where you go 
But you gotta get out o? here 
Okay? 
Cancer, chronic fatigue, ugly or just plain po? 
I love all y?all 
Don't you ever mess with me no mo? 
Ho What time is it? 
All right then 
That's it, y?all 
I'm out like the Wolves in the first 
But we gonna get it together though 
Pookie! The limo warm? 
A?ight, Cool 
Peace y?all 
Stay funky
