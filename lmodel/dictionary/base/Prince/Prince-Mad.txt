<song artist="Prince" title="Mad">
Uh!
(Mad) Mad
I'm about 2 go mad
Uh!
Mad! (He's always on some medication)
I'm gonna 2 go mad
If U ever let me knock it
Mad! (He's always on some medication)
Oh, I'm gonna 2 go mad
If U ever let me rock it
Just like a movie
I've seen it a dozen times
I'm hip 2 every single trick
I know every single line
I called U at the beauty shop
They say U been there and gone
Must be a hand missing on your clock
The time keepin' sure is wrong
But U can do what U wanna when U wanna
Just as long as I'm the one U bring your booty 2
Don't know what 2 say about the lady
Can depend on whenever I did it 2
I'm gonna go mad (He's always on some medication)
Ooh baby, mad!
If U ever let me knock it
Mad! (He's always on some medication)
Oh baby, mad!
If U ever let me rock it
I don't wanna get elected
I only wanna get U hot (Hot!)
And after U've been inspected (Ooh)
I'll give U all the love I've got
If U like a brother naughty
I'm the one 2 get into (Get into it)
The angel in my bed will hold your attention
While I hold somethin' dear 2 U
U can do what U wanna when U wanna
Just as long as I'm the one U bring your booty 2, huh
Don't know what 2 say about the lady
Can depend on whenever I did it 2
I'm gonna go mad (He's always on some medication)
Oh baby, mad!
If U ever let me knock it
Mad! (He's always on some medication)
Oh baby, mad!
If U ever let me rock it
(Mad) Ow! {x2}
Mad! (Yo baby)
Is that my guitar? (Yeah) (Mad)
Turn on the dirty switch and back up far (Ooh baby)
(On some medication) (Mad)
(Ooh baby) (Mad)
U can do what U wanna when U wanna
Just as long as I'm the one U bring your booty 2
(Don't know what 2 say about the lady)
(Can depend on whenever I did it 2)
I don't know what 2 say, baby
But I'm gonna 2 go mad!
Oh baby, I'm gonna 2 go mad!
(If U ever let me knock it)
Mad! (He's always on some medication)
Oh baby, mad!
If U ever let me rock it
(Mad) {repeat}
{"Bee-bop 2 hip-hop" looped sample in BG}
(Do what U wanna) {repeats in BG}
Uh, uh, and U don't stop
Uh, uh, and U can't stop
Throw your hands up in the air (Mad)
Sing that shit y'all, uh (Mad) (Mad)
Ooh baby, I'm gonna go mad
If U ever let me knock it
Mad (He's always on some medication)
Oh baby, mad
If U ever let me, if U ever let me
If U ever let me, let me, ... rock it!
Hey, oh Lord
(Mad)
Yeah
{samples repeat to end}
Oh baby, mad!
If U ever let me rock it
