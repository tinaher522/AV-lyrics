"Alright"
"Alright, this is a.. this is an oldie" {Michael J. Fox sample}
Brick (Boom! Say it) house (Hell yes)
She's mighty Mayte, lettin' it all hang out
She's a brick (Boom! Think I ain't?) house (Hell yes)
That lady's stacked, that's a fact, ain't holdin' nothin' back
The clothes I wear, my sexy ways
Make an old man wish 4 younger days (Yeah)
I know I'm built and know how 2 please
Sho'nuff can knock a strong man 2 his knees
CHORUS:
She's a brick (Boom! Say it) house (Hell yes)
She's mighty Mayte, lettin' it all hang out
She's a brick (Boom! Think I ain't?) house (Hell yes)
That lady's stacked, that's a fact, ain't holdin' nothin' back
I know I got everything
That a woman needs 2 get a man (Yeah)
How can I lose with the stuff I use?
36-24-36, oh, what a winning hand!
CHORUS
La la la la la
("I need U 2 tell me") {Mavis Staples sample}
I'm well put 2gether, everybody knows
But that ain't all this house of brick has got 2 show
Every curly q I got is holdin' a thought
Thinkin' about some of this and that's why I never get caught
Strokin' many brothas just 2 get the bank
"Yeah, U look good keepin' gas in my tank"
And if they wanna play me like a puppet 4 the mack
While I'm gettin' paid, y'all can step the fuck back!
Brick (Boom! Say it) house (Hell yes)
She's mighty Mayte, lettin' it all hang out
She's a brick (Boom! Think I ain't?) house (Hell yes)
That lady's stacked, that's a fact, ain't holdin' nothin' back
(Ooh, come on baby)
Brick (Boom! Say it) house (Hell yes)
She's mighty Mayte, lettin' it all hang out
She's a brick (Boom! Think I ain't?) house (Hell yes)
That lady's stacked, that's a fact, ain't holdin' nothin' back
(Come on baby)
Brick house (Migthy Mayte)
I love it (Yeah)
Peace
Brick house {x4}
