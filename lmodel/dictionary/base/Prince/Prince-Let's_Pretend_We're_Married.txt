<song artist="Prince" title="Let's_Pretend_We're_Married">
Excuse me but I need a mouth like yours
2 help me forget the girl that just walked out my door
Funny but it seems that U're alone like me
If U are, girl let's come see what we can see
Ooh, little darlin', if U're free 4 a couple o' hours (Free 4 a couple o' hours)
If U ain't busy 4 the next 7 years (Next 7 years)
I said let's pretend we're married and go all night
There ain't nothin' wrong if it feels alright
I won't stop until the mornin' light
Let's pretend we're married and go all night 2night
Ooh wee sha sha coo coo yeah
All the hippies sing 2gether
Excuse me but I need your chemistry
Don't U wanna be my fantasy?
My girl's gone and she don't care at all
And if she did, so what, come on baby, let's ball!
Ooh, little darlin', if U're free 4 a couple o' hours (Free 4 a couple o' hours)
If U ain't busy 4 the next 7 years (Next 7 years)
I said let's pretend we're married and go all night
There ain't nothin' wrong if it feels alright
I won't stop until the mornin' light
Let's pretend we're married and go all night 2night
Ooh wee sha sha coo coo yeah
All the hippies sing 2gether
Let's just pretend we're married 2night
Excuse me but I need a mouth like yours
2 help me forget the girl that just walked out my door
Let's pretend we're married and do it all night
I won't stop until the mornin' light
Huh, let's pretend we're married and go all night, yeah
Ooh, little darlin', if U're free 4 a couple o' hours (Free 4 a couple o' hours)
If U ain't busy 4 the next 7 years (Next 7 years)
Oh darlin', let's pretend we're married and go all night
There ain't nothin' wrong if it feels alright
I won't stop until the mornin' light
Let's pretend we're married and go all night! (2night)
(Ooh wee sha sha coo coo yeah)
Pretend we're married
Let's pretend we're married
(Ooh wee sha sha coo coo yeah)
(Ooh wee sha sha coo coo yeah)
(Ooh wee sha sha coo coo yeah)
(Ooh wee sha sha coo coo yeah)
All the hippies sing 2gether
Oh everybody
All the hippies sing 2gether
Yeah, yeah
My girl's gone and she don't care at all
And if she did, so what, come on baby, let's ball
I wanna fuck U so bad it hurts, it hurts, it hurts
Ooh, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna fuck U
Yeah, I wanna, I wanna, ooh, I wanna fuck U
Look you Martian, I'm not sayin' this just 2 be nasty
I sincerely wanna fuck the taste outta your mouth
Can U relate?
My girl's gone and she don't care at all
And if she did, I wouldn't care, let's ball
Whatever U heard about me is true
I change the rules and do what I wanna do
I'm in love with God, He's the only way
Cuz U and I know we gotta die some day
If U think I'm crazy, U're probably right
But I'm gonna have fun every motherfuckin' night
If U like 2 fight, U're a double-drag fool
I'm goin' 2 another life, how 'bout U?
