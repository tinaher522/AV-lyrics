<song artist="Prince" title="Silicon">
Welcome 2 the slaughterhouse
Silicon
Rope of silicon
Just a rope of silicon
The rope of silicon
One day U'll get outside the doo-rag
When U really want 2 contemplate this, jacked up (Jacked up)Paranormal situation that your people got into
Can I hip U?
Long ago who considered the outcome?
Now I'm thinking that a cat like U would be troublesome
And sock U in the mind tangling curriculum
Guaranteed 2 leave U in a state of delirium
While all along teaching they kids in the valley 2 become unlike U:
broke and dumb
Just a rope of silicon
Rope of silicon
Just a rope of silicon
Rope of silicon
On a magical rope of silicon
U can bet that they'll be chillin' in Babylon
Thinking about a way that they can split the proton
While U eating all the bloody chicken and dead prawn
Mickey D. shake and a filet mignon
Swearing up and down U the picture of health, now come on!
Just a rope of silicon (Dance)
Just a rope of silicon
Rope of silicon
U're just a rope of silicon (U)
2 the slaughterhouse
Leave that blood alone
Don't U know that dead blood kills interferons
Making the immune system victim 2 whereupon
Any known virus can boot up and log on
ww.U.com
CHORUS:
Rope of silicon
Just a rope of silicon
Rope of silicon
Just a rope of silicon
Rope of silicon {x3}
Just a rope of silicon
Now U've found me, now that U're here
Let's talk about the U in this con
If U're getting bored don't front, just yawn
This is the kind of stuff that requires patience
Never mind the rhyme just relax and wax the song
That on and on and on and on
Ain't gonna stop 'till the early mornin'
Break it down, later on come break down, y'all
What?
Dance {x5}
(Dance on the funk)
Just dance
(Dance on the funk)
Dance
(Dance on the funk)
Just dance
(Dance on the funk)
CHORUS
Rope of silicon
Just a rope of silicon
Just a rope...
This is why U was looking 4 me? Then check it
Let's talk about the U in this con
If U're getting bored don't front, just yawn
Cuz this is the kind of stuff that requires patience
Don't think, just wax on
If U are the eye that is the pawn
U beget the dead fruit of Armageddon
Thick skin reigns in the realm of the pseudonym
While the blows taken by the silly con
The family does well with God 2 keep it strong
Never a paradox, never a hexagon
U plus he or she keep going on
But with another one of U in the title of this song
Goes on and on and on and on and on and on
CHORUS
Dance, dance on the funk {x10}
Dance {x2}
