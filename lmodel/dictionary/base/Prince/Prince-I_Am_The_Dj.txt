<song artist="Prince" title="I_Am_The_Dj">
I am the DJ, I can make U dance
I play what I play because I can
I follow no one, I don't give a damn
I'm here 2 have fun and make U jam
[Chorus:]
When I scritchy, scritchy, scratch
I will make U shake your back
U'll be lookin' up and callin' me sire
I'm the leader of the pack
I'm the first and only act
I'm the DJ, I can take U higher, higher
No, I don't need your money, put half a mil' a year
U want your record played, it's got 2 freak my ear
Save your dollars (money, money, money) and pawn my sizzlin' tears
I am the DJ and I'm all U'll ever hear
[Chorus]
Who needs a freakin' video if the groove ain't all good?
MTV could be rollin' but it won't be in the 'hood
Check it - when the techno-bunnies request U
That's when U're comin' strong
Everything else is jack-off
It all starts with a good song, ha ha
I am the DJ
I play what I play
I am the DJ
Scritch, scritch, scratch
I am the DJ, I can make U dance
I play what I play because I can
I follow no one, I don't give a damn
I'm here 2 have fun and make U jam, jam, jam, jam, jam! (Yes)
[Chorus]
(Shake your back)
(Go, ooh!)
(Let me tell U, boy)
Baby, oh yeah
DJ, DJ
(I'm the DJ, I can take U higher, higher)
DJ, check it [x3]
DJ [x6]
