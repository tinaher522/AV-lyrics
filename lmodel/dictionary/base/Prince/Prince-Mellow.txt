<song artist="Prince" title="Mellow">
Wanna get lost in the mellow mellow of my mind?
Chop a tree, pay the cost
I'd rather have a glass of U - that's fine
Come on over baby around 7
Chill in your favorite chair
U can watch a tape of this mellow afterparty
Macy and Common were there
Besides U know it takes awhile 4 me 2 do my hair
Come on get lost in the mellow mellow {x2}
How's that feel?
Where U wanna eat 2night, baby?
I know this dope spot called "One Another"
Or maybe we might swing by "The Egg"
The perfect place 2 play house - I could smother U
Or I just might be runnin' lines
There's just so much U can find
In the mellow of my mind
(Come on get lost in the mellow mellow, baby)
Come on get lost in the mellow mellow
This rainbow psychedelia
Come on (Come on get lost in the mellow mellow )
There ain't nothin' 2 be afraid of in the mellow mellow
Just U and me groovin' in the mellow (mellow mellow) of my mind
Now break it down
I wanna get lost in the composition of U
Learn the rhythm and play the only note U want me 2
I'm a good learner and once I understand
I'll stand under U and let U show me what U want your man 2 be
I could dance 4 U - a little comical minuet
If U desire I'll shed my attire - anything 2 get U wet
Shower, my flower?
So much 2 do, so little time
Choose wisely and U can find thee
In the mellow of my mind
Come on get lost in the mellow mellow {x2}
Can I sing 2 U while U bring yourself 2 joy?
I'll go slow at first, while U quench your thirst
Wet circles around the toy
While U bring yourself 2 joy
