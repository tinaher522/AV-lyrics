<song artist="Prince" title="Adore">
Ooh, hoo, hoo, hoo...
Baby... darlin'! You're the best, oh....
Until the end of time, I'll be there for you;
You own my heart and mind - I truly adore you...
If God one day struck me blind, your beauty I'd still see;
Love's too weak to define just what you mean to me...
From the first moment I saw you, ooh, I knew you were the one;
That night, I had to call you - I was rappin' till the sun came up,
Tellin' you just how fine you look - In a word, you were sex;
All of my cool attitude you took - My body was next...
You made love to me like you were afraid - was you afraid of me?
Was I the first? Was I your every fantasy?
That's why until the end of time, I'll be there for you;
You own my heart and mind - I truly adore you...
If God one day struck me blind, your beauty I'd still see;
Love's too weak to define just what you mean to me...
When we be makin' love, I only hear the sounds; (Ooh-oh-ooh...)
Heavenly angels cryin' above, tears of joy pourin' down on us...
They know we need each other, they know you are my fix, uh-huh; (You know I ain't cheatin' on ya, baby...)
I know that you know I ain't cheatin', baby - They know this is serious, I ain't fuckin' just for kicks, no...
This condition I've got is crucial, crucial, baby;
You can say that I'm a terminal case - you could burn up my clothes, smash up my ride... (You could smash up...)
Well, maybe not the ride! But I got to have your face all up in the place;
(Do you think) I'd like to think that I'm a man of exquisite taste... (I'm a man of exquisite taste?)
Hundred-percent Italian silk, imported Egyptian lace;
Nothin', baby, I said nothin', baby, could compare 
(Nothing could compare) to your lovely face... (to your lovely face...)
Do you know what I'm sayin' to you this evening?
Tryin', tryin' to say, just tryin' to say
That until, until the end of time, I'll be there for you...
Be there for you...
You own my heart, you own my mind... (I truly adore you...)
I truly adore you... (Adore!)
You don't know what you mean to me, baby, I... 
(Until the end of time,) Adore ya! (I'll be there for you;) Adore ya, yeah!
(You own my heart and mind,) 'Til the end of time, I'll be there for you... (I truly adore you...)
(Adore you...) Can I talk to you? Tell you what you mean to me?
Every time you wander, I'll be your eyes so you can see; 
(Until the end of time, I'll be there for you;)
I wanna show you things that I show no other, I wanna be
(You own my heart and mind - I truly adore you...)
More than, more than your mother, more than your brother... 
(If God one day struck me blind, your beauty I'd still see;)
I wanna be, like no, like no other...
(Love's too weak to define just what you mean to me...)
If you need me, I'll never leave - I know, that you know, without you, there is no me...
(Until the end of time, I'll be there for you;)
There is no me... Without you, there is no sea!
(You own my heart and mind - I truly adore you...)
There is no shore! Love is to weak to define how much I adore
(If God one day struck me blind, your beauty I'd still see;)
You, child... you, child... The last words you hear, the last words you hear...
(Love's too weak to define just what you mean to me...)
Until! (Until the end of time...) I'll be there for you, baby! (Oh, oh, oh...)
(Until the end of time...) Be with me darlin' 'til the end of all time... (Oh, oh, oh...)
(Until the end of time...) I'll give you my heart, I'll give you my mind, (Oh, oh, oh...)
(Until the end of time...) I'll give you my body, I'll give you my time... 
(Until the end of time, oh, oh, oh...)
(Until the end of time...) For all time I am with you, you are with me;
(Until the end of time...) Ooh, you are with me...
You are with me...
