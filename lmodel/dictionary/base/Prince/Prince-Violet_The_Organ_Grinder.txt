<song artist="Prince" title="Violet_The_Organ_Grinder">
CHORUS:
I am Violet the Organ Grinder
And I grind all the live long day
I live 4 the organ that I am grinding
I'll die, but I won't go away 
Gett Off {repeated throughout song}
CHORUS
Ooh, wait a minute, I think U better trip on this {x2}
I was on my way 2 another room
When an image of U sweetly 
Appeared in the mirror, perhaps U recall
U and I were neatly
In the middle of a Crystal Ball
And it now serves as a reminder on the wall 
Of U and I, the organ grinder
In the greatest concert of them all
(CHORUS)
I am Violet the Organ Grinder
And I grind all the live long day
I live 4 the organ, I am grinding
I'll die, but I will not go away
Did U know that I still have your stockings?
I keep 'em in a drawer next 2 your brassiere
Come hither, my sweet, lend me your attention,
Come hither, lend my your ear
I do believe my piano was stolen
I do believe that U want me near
Well I can deal with a sucker if he's in your mouth
But I can't deal with insincere
I am the one that lives in your heart
U love me, no matter what U say
Swear U don't miss the organ grinder
Grinding on U every day

I am Violet the Organ Grinder
And I grind all the live long day (Check this out)
Ooh, wait a minute, I think U better trip on this
I took all the pictures U gave me
And I placed them right under my bed
And I pumped and I pumped
'Til the 'gasmer just jumped
From my feet 2 the top of my head, oh boy!
(CHORUS)
I'm Violet the Organ Grinder
And I grind all the live long day
I live 4 the organ, that I'm grinding
I'll die, but I will not go away
Ooh, wait a minute, I think U better trip on this
Like a puppy, I licked your devotion
From your neck, from your eyes, from your ears
When U cried, I became your emotion
And if U ever cry like that again I'll be here
(CHORUS)
'cause I'm Violet the Organ Grinder
And I grind all the live long day
I live 4 the organ, that I'm grinding
I'll die, but I won't go away
Not even...
(Gangsta) {x3}
(Who turned the mother out) {x2}
{repeat phrase}
