<song artist="Prince" title="Ain't_No_Place_Like_U">
Ain't no place like U {x2}
I told all my friends don't be callin' me
Cuz there ain't nothin' that I wanna see
I called my job and quit workin' overtime
Cuz I've got somethin' that's been on my mind
CHORUS:
Cuz baby it's true, ain't no place like U
Cuz baby it's true, ain't no place like U
Don't want distraction so I'm puttin' on my machine
"Wrong number" - simple and clean
Go 2 my closet, pull out the dress
The one that makes U wanna lay your head upon my chest
CHORUS
Ain't no place, ain't no place {x2}
I've put this feelin' on hold 4 much 2 long
And now this feelin', it done got 2 strong
I need the body that makes it disappear
I need the body and I need it right here
It's true, ain't no place like U
Cuz baby it's true, oh, ain't no place like U
Send me 2 Marbella, London, Paris 2
Send me all around the world and when I'm through
I ain't seein' nothin' cuz there ain't no place like U
I told all my friends don't be callin' me
Cuz there ain't nothin' that I wanna see
I ain't seein' nothin' cuz there ain't no place like U
Ain't no place like U
Cuz baby it's true, ain't no place like U
