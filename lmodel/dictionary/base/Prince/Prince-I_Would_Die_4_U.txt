<song artist="Prince" title="I_Would_Die_4_U">
I'm not a woman
I'm not a man
I am something that you'll never understand
I'll never beat you
I'll never lie
And if you're evil
I'll forgive you by and by
'Cos you, I would die for you, yeah
Darlin', if you want me to
You, I would die for you
I'm not your lover
I'm not your friend
I am something that you'll never comprehend
No need to worry
No need to cry
I'm your messiah and you're the reason why
'Cos you, I would die for you, yeah
Darlin', if you want me to
You, I would die for you
You're just a sinner I am told
Be your fire when you're cold
Make you happy when you're sad
Make you good when you are bad
I'm not a human, I am a dove
I'm your conscience, I am love
All I really need is to know that you believe (Yeah)
'Cos you, I would die for you, yeah
Darlin', if you want me to
You, I would die for you
Yeah, say it one more time
You, I would die for you (you)
Darlin', if you want me to
You, I would die for you
2, 3, 4, you
I would die for you
I would die for you
You, I would die for you
You, I would die for you
