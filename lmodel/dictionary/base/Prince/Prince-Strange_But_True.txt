<song artist="Prince" title="Strange_But_True">
Ok, let me say this quick b4 I start 2 cry
U're the only one that I gave it 2
The one I fantasized for 
And time away from U has taught me 
What I should've known
This hole I'm trying to fill with another
Yeah, it's grown and I got u're package
But when I tried to write U back I bailed
See trying 2 express the future sometimes language fails
And over this time, I've learned
My life force has increased by knowing U
Every door that closes another one opens
Strange but true
But no regrets because I 4get the unfamiliar faces
Those petty lies and alibies, just golddigger's chasin
Dreams of sovereignty, they tried 2 come between U and me
A curse therein set forth a chain of events 
That only freed me when I remembered
Where I was and who I am
The only Prince that will ever rule this Holy Land
All understand and all stand under this affirmation now
By the power invested in me by God all negativity bows
Strange but true, let's see what U can do
U may have lost me... uh, but I found myself
The one's who love me without condition
This is my wealth and with these words, I will win
Repeat them over and over again
All understand and all stand under this affirmation now
By the power invested in me by God all negativity bows
All negativity bows, all negativity bows
Strange but true, let's see what U can do
Strange but true, let's see what U can do
All negativity bows.
Strange but true (3x)
All negativity bows
Strange but true, let's see what U can do
All negativity bows (2x)
Strange but true (5x)
