<song artist="Prince" title="Elixer">
I can see your face every time
Anywhere, any place in my mind
If my guard is ever low
There's a place that I can go
Elixer, elixer, elixer
You can fight in vain
I'm gonna have my way all night and all day
Seven tears fall like rain in between the joy and pain
Oowie, baby
Elixer, elixer, elixer
Elixer, elixer, elixer
Hand in hand woman and man
Through the tallest doors, up the stairs
Two animals spawning in a river
They go there, oowie, baby
Oh elixer, up and down
Elixer round and round
Elixer, don't stop baby
Elixer, elixer, elixer
With his pen, ink and tongue
Is this real or all in fun
He writes it there
Naked girl, naked boy they lay exposed
Can you hear it? Can you hear it?
Fully clothed
Elixer, elixer, elixer
Elixer, elixer, elixer
