<song artist="Prince" title="Guitar">
(Ow)
(Like I love my guitar)
(Verse)
Get dirty at the club we're in
Use it around your waist like a chain within
I got that call so I jumped in my car
I love you baby
But not like I love my guitar
(Chorus)
No
Not like I love my guitar
(Verse)
You couldn't do it all by yourself
You had to go and get somebody else
You're high enough to call me
But you can't reach the phone
I love you baby
But not like I love my guitar
(Chorus)
No
Not like I love my guitar
Turn it up
(Verse)
I tried to warn you
That it's hard to be a star
Especially when you're driving other peoples' cars
Would've gave you mine girl
But you took it too far
I love you baby
Just not like I love my guitar
(Chorus)
(Verse)
I know you love me
And you want to be friends
And if you don't, at least you need to pretend
We'll still be together
If we don't get that far
I love you baby, but not like I love this guitar
(Outro)
I love you baby and I wish you well
I'll write a letter when I learn how to spell
Until the day you can go to hell
I love you baby you know the rest
