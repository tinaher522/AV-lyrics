<song artist="Prince" title="Chaos_&_Disorder">
(check check, ok cool, rolling)
(hey)
(yeah)
Carjack used 2 fix flat tires (get your ass out of the car now!)
Cadillac used 2 be a benz (hey, get out of the street)
Big joints never gotcha higher
Freebase cost u in the end
I'm just a no-name reporter
I wish I had nothing 2 say
Looking through my new camcorder
Trying 2 find a crime that pays
I get hit by mortars, everywhere I go I'm loitering
Chaos and disorder ruinin' my world 2day
He's gay used 2 mean he's happy
Nowadays happy ain't allowed (alright)
U're played used to mean top 40
(you're listening to wnpg and we will (? ) chaos)
Now 40 days of being played ain't proud
I'm just a no-name reporter
I wish I had nothing 2 say
Lookin' through my new camcorder

Trying 2 find a crime that pays
I get hit by mortars, everywhere I go I'm loitering
Chaos and disorder ruinin' my world 2day
(yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Safe sex used 2 mean no babies
When intercourse used to mean fun
If I had 15 ladies
I would only f**k with 1
I get hit by a mortar, everywhere I go I'm loitering
Chaos and disorder (rulin'/ruinin') my world today
(good guys, look the way (...) coming down here)
((...) f**k (...) we belong)
((...) senora (...))
(I'm not gonna tell her (...) a lot of work to do)
Yeah, yeah, yeah ((...))
Yeah, yeah, yeah (yeah)
(oh whoa no no no)
(hey)
