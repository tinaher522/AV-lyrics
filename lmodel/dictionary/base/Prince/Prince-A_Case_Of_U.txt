<song artist="Prince" title="A_Case_Of_U">
Eye am a lonely painter
Eye live in a box of paints
Eye used 2 b frightened by the devil
and drawn 2 those who weren't afraid
Remember when u told me
that love was touching souls?
Well, surely u touched mine
Part of u pours out of me from time 2 time in these lines
U're in my blood like holy wine... u're so bitter and so sweet
Eye could drink a case of u darling
and still b on my feet... still b on my feet
