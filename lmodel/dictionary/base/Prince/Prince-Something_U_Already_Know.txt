<song artist="Prince" title="Something_U_Already_Know">
This is something you already know
I love it when your body's all up close to me
All up close to me, I love it all up close to me
I love it when your body's all up close to me
I love it, all up close to me, close to me
Woke up this morning with a smile on my face
And the sweet aftertaste of loving you
Without a warning I felt the whole earth shake
Thinking 'bout the love we make and boy it's true
I had some trouble walking and only heaven knows
That finding all my clothes would be a miracle
Everything I do is better 'cause the serotonin flow is such
That the simplest things with you are never dull, no
I am only telling you what you already know
Baby you know, you know, you know
I love it when your body's all up close to me
All up close to me, I love it, I love it
If you could see me now hanging with my friends
The fun it never ends it's 'cause of you, oh baby
Yes we'll be sho' nuff kicking it later on tonight
In your favorite dress alright and we'll be ooh
Doing what we do, back and forth on a rocking horse
A fantasy is better in real life of course
Unless of course the name of that stallion's me
To the east and the west coast, south and north
Around the world baby and then some more
With you that's when real life's better than fantasy
Feel me
I am only telling you what you already know
Know, know, know
Telling you what you already know
You know this
I love it when your body's all up close to me
All up close to me, I love it all up close to me
I, I love it when you tell me stories straight from the dome
About how your favorite song is home
I love it, I love it, I love it baby
I love it when you kiss me, yeah you know right there
And when I tell you to lower your pitch
You get so deep, it's hard to bear
I love it when you pull my hair gently baby, I don't care
Go ahead and pull it, don't be scared
I love, I love it, I love it when
I love it when your, I love it when your face
I love it when your face is like a treasure buried in the pot of gold
At the end of the rainbow, come on, come on
Taste the rainbow, come on, come on
I'm only telling you something, only telling you something
I'm only telling you something that you
Only telling you something you already know
I am only telling you what you already know
