<song artist="Prince" title="Cause_And_Effect">
I am here. where are you? 
Ladies and gentlemen..... 
Cause and effect 
Hey, hey, hey 
Iif had the chance to do it all again 
I wouldn't change a thing, except my next of kin 
There's something on the tip of my tongue 
-got a taste for sin 
If you stamp your passport full of regret 
You have nothing to remember but a lot to forget 
Leave no enemies, leave no debt 
Made in the image of gods intellect
