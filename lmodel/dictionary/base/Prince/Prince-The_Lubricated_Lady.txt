<song artist="Prince" title="The_Lubricated_Lady">
New Power
Lay down your funkyÂ
Get off!
Get off, baby
What can a brother do when the clock keeps ticking U off?
Turn the other cheek or kick a nut till he coughs, "Get off"
"Get off"
CHORUS:
On the positive tip
I'm equipped with a whip
But I don't have 2 spank U cuz this is my ship
Get off {x2}
(Get off, baby)
I will still be hip
When the words from your lip take a dip in the ratings
Then I'll be stripping your Mercedes off your Lubricated Lady
And taking her 4 a walk, taking her 4 a walk
On the positive tip
I'm equipped with a whip
I don't have 2 spank U cuz this is my ship
Get off {x4}
Ooh, is this a dream?
No - everybody get off
Is this a dream? {x2}
Get-a-get-a-get-a-get off
CHORUS
(I got the bed 4 U)
Get off (Hey, hey sugar)
Get off
(Get off) {repeat in BG}
Once I give her back 2 ya
She won't ever wanna do ya
Cuz I wrote the book
I taught her how 2 look
She showed me the money U gave her - I took
I even ate her cooking
That's more than U did
Get off {x2}
What can a brother do when the clock keeps ticking U off?
Turn the other cheek or kick a nut till he cough, "Get off" (Ooh, help me)
"Get off" (Get off)
Get off {sampled}
New Power {sampled}
Everybody get off {x2}
Is this a dream? {x2}
Get-a-get-a-get-a-get off
CHORUS
(I got the bed 4 U)
Get off (Hey, hey sugar)
Get off
What can a brother do when the clock keeps ticking U off?
Turn the other cheek or kick a nut till he cough, "Get off" (Ooh, help me)
"Get off" (Oh)
Get off {repeat and sampled}
Everything alright back there
