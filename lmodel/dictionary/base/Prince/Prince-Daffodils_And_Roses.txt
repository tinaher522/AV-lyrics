<song artist="Prince" title="Daffodils_And_Roses">
(feat. Gwen Stefani)
It turns us all around
You know you never do it
You pour the concrete in
And praise and then you poo it
Well, wipe the surface clean
You know you wanna use it
Feel that sugar burn
You know you wanna prove it
Uh huh, uh huh
Pride and dignity
Have got you in September
By the time we make it
Denny's (?) will remember
Well, air conditioned rooms
Will make this feeling better
What's between my legs
I know is even wetter, yeah
Cuz dafodils and roses
Are all very nice
But they won't tell you where I am
They won't get in between my
Red fire and a magnetic force
I need to be
I need to be uncontrollably torn
Uncontrollably torn
Uncontrollably
We'll settle in your couch
You know I got some questions
About some dreams you had
I think you forgot to mention
A lemonade you hold (?)
And now there's no one listening
Well, just a vacant space
With wall and paint that's chipping
The clock's a-striking three
And there's no way I'm proving
That doesn't (?) falls on you
And all that you have moving (?)
Little me with all of all your expectations
Well, just remember now
I got your emancipation, yeah
Cuz dafodils and roses
Are all very nice
But they won't tell you where I am
They won't get in between my
Red fire and a magnetic force
I need to be
I need to be uncontrollably
Cuz dafodils and roses
Are all very nice
But bring them in to your insides
And they'll show you some
Better eat (?), reliable source
Lets you know that you're
Uncontrollably torn
Uncontrollably torn
Uncontrollably torn
Uncontrollably torn
Cuz dafodils and roses
Are all very nice
But what's inside me you want
Be able to pay my price
See me erupt in fire
The earth, that's my source
Is what I need
To make me uncontrollably torn
Sarah (?), did the fairies tell you
How to please your prince?
Just a dash of pixie dust
You've been fucking him ever since
Well, you know you've been domesticated
Yeah, I wanna do this
The keys in the house
The picket fence of bliss
You know, everybody loves you
When you're beautiful
Hard to open up (?)
Even when you know
She'll give all (?)
Well, if it's so dramatic
Why do I feel reborn?
Why do I feel like I'm
Uncontrollably torn?
So uncontrollably torn
Uncontrollably torn
