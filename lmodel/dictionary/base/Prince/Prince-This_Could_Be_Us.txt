<song artist="Prince" title="This_Could_Be_Us">
U ready?
Naw... U ain't ready (no you ain't ready)
I mean ready for us.
U know u want me like a new pair of shoes
This could be us
But u be playin'
This could be us
But u keep on foolin' around
U're the cage to me dove
I'm just saying
Forever and ever in love
Ooh baby yeah, this could be us
U know u want me like a new pair of shoes
This could be us
This could be us
U, u say u ain't ready
Ready to go steady
Ain't ready for 'us' (no)
'Cause what I got make u weak in in the knees
Take your energy, make u sleep for a week
Sex with me ain't enough
That's why we gotta do it metaphysically
This could be us
This could be us
This could be us
This could be us
I, I know u're loving your freedom
Cuz yo freedom (freedom) is payin' yo bills, yes it is
Boyfriends, u think u don't need 'em
But in the middle of the cold, cold night
I think u will, sho' u right
This could be us, yes
But u be playin' (oh yeah...)
This could be us (you sho' nuff could be)
But u keep on foolin' around
We...we come up on a crossroad
And we got to decide which way to turn
which way "yes" which way to turn
Are we gonna go (Are we gonna go) Go (Are we gonna)
Over the bridge... Over the bridge (Over the bridge)
Before, before it burns
Don't u let it burn, let it burn, baby
This could be us
This could be us, oh yeah
This could be us
Oh u gotta stop playing' baby
Everybody knows, everybody knows
That a woman needs love (L-O-V-E love)
Like a river flow, like a river flow inside
If its good that's all she thinking of
Metaphysical
Sleep alone if you wanna (nothing mystical...Â ???)
But like a new pair of shoes
(after that) U gonna wanna show me off to your friends
(cant beleive my purple psychadelic pimp slap)
This right here, this could be us
This could be us
But u be playin'
This could be us
But u keep on foolin' around
U're the cage to me dove
I'm just saying
Forever and ever in love
Ooh baby yeah, this could be us
This could be us
This could be us
This could be, this could be us
This could be us
This could be us
Can't u see it baby
U're the cage to my dove
Only one I been dreaming of
Forever and ever in love
Ooh baby yeah
This could, this could be, this could be us
But u don't have time for me no more
