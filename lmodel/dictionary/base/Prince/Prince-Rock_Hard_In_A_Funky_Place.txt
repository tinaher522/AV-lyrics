<song artist="Prince" title="Rock_Hard_In_A_Funky_Place">
Does anybody know U're here?
This house of ill-repute (Ooh honey, I'm scared of U)
Tryin' 2 deal with all your fears
I guess this is what U get 4 being cute (Cute, cute)
Soaked in banana cologne
No wonder U're all alone
It's written all over your face
U're just a rockhard in a funky place
Rockhard in a funky place
Here comes a lady so U cover up
She's a freak hot funky electric mama with double cups
(OK now, come on, come on, girl - let's see, come on)
See, Uâ€¦ U couldn't cop if U wanted 2
Because something near your leg is haunting U
Such a disgrace, U're a rockhard in a funky place (Ow!)
Ha ha, y'all
Rockhard in a funky place
U was workin' on the line U could drop on her (Uh, uh)
But U couldn't concentrate when your dick saw her (Uh, uh)
Maybe if U cop a nut in the car (Maybe if U cop a nut in the car)
Maybe U could think about playing guitar
(Rock, rock) {repeat}
Oh yeah {x3}
Rockhard in a funky place
All U're looking 4 is love
Or a reason 2 believe there's a God above
Pretty soon U'll get enough
And head back 2 a life so tough
I just hate 2 see an erection go 2 waste (Aaaah)
I'm just a rockhard in a funky place
Rockhard in a funky place
Say it - rockhard in a funky place
Rockhard in a funky place
Oh, U rockhard in a funky place
U rockhard in a funky place
Say it, y'all
(Rock, rock) {repeat 2 fade}
What?
We gotta go, y'all
Tune in next week
Same time, same boogie
Rock hard
Oh yeah, we will rock, y'all
But until then keep your finger on the trigger
That's the only way it'll get bigger
What kind of fuck ending was that?
