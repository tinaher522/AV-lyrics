<song artist="Prince" title="Here_On_Earth">
Imagine a young woman running 4 her very life
Tryin' 2 get away from the one who loves her
this young woman ur wife
In2 an alley cold and rainy
October just b4 dawn...
Leaping atop a mountain of bricks
her clothes now covered with sick,
The danger hardly gone
She turns and curses the day she met u
and that she wishes she was never born...
Say it's just a dream...
U open up ur eyes and come 2 realize
u simply imagined this
So u lean over and give her a kiss
Here on earth, here on earth,
with u it's not so bad
Here on earth, here on earth
I don't feel so sad
Stay right here
Here on earth
