<song artist="Prince" title="Dance_With_The_Devil">
Cunning liar, eternal fire
Demon clever, promise 4ever
The curious try and always die
Live in fear, the devil is near
Can U feel his breath? Pray 4 death
The curious try and always die
"U men point those search lights up on the tower right now - move, move!"
Have no Savior, have no faith
Never look 4 Heaven's gate
Devil's children, no love inside
There is a soul, but it has died
Devil's children, no love inside
There is a soul, but it has died
And it cries, and it cries?
CHORUS:
Dance with the devil in the pale moonlight
Put your arms around him and hold him tight
Give up 2 the feeling and don't try 2 fight
He wants your soul and he wants it 2night
Dance with the devil in the pale moonlight
Put your arms around him and hold him tight
Close your eyes 2 love and die
Dance with the devil in the pale moonlight {sampled till end}
"U know, without U I just wouldn't wanna go on"
CHORUS {x2}
Dance with the devil in the pale moonlight
Put your arms around him and hold him tight
"It's as though we were made 4 each other
Beauty and the Beast
Of course if anyone else calls U Beast
I'll rip their lungs out"
Dance with the devil in the pale moonlight
Put your arms around him and hold him tight
