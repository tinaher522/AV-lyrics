<song artist="Prince" title="Eliminate_The_Negative">
Think from a positive positive place
And eliminate the negative base
Think from a positive positive place
And eliminate the negative base
If U think from a positive place 
And try hard 2 eliminate the negative base
Then all the many colors runnin' round this world
Would create an unstoppable race
So come 2gether my brother and love one another
And let's make this a peaceful place
4 all the children 2 enjoy, every small girl and boy
This land we must not waste
CHORUS:
Think from a positive positive place
And eliminate the negative base
Think from a positive positive place
And eliminate the negative base
Think from a positive positive place
And eliminate the negative base
Think from a positive positive place
And eliminate the negative base
Negative is darkness, positive is light
Our communities are dying, the families are not tight
Parents get 2gether let's do this right (Let's do this right)
So our future is strong enough 2 win this fight
CHORUS
The enemy is darkness, God is light
Jealousy, envy, narrow-minded weary
Prejudice, bigotry, arrogance, leery
Vicious minds, soul unkind surely needs 2 feel thee
CHORUS
(Ooh, ohh) {repeat in background}
(New power, yeah)
(Clap your hands and stomp your feet) {"I No" sample} {fade out}
U want me 2 what?
(Clap your hands and stomp your feet)
Yo, what?
