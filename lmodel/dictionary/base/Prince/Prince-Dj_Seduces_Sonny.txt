Sonny t.? 
Hey man, sorry 4 f**kin' up your turn-tables
Mr. dj (brother jules)
That, that, that's cool man, that's cool
Y'all didn't have 2 break my hundred fifty dollar glasses though
But just 2 show u that there ain't no hard feelings (mmm)
I got a couple of ladies here I wanna introduce 2 ya (ahhh)
Prime beef boy, check it out (mmm mmm)
Check it out

It's very nice 2 meet y'all, won't u ladies have a seat? (mmm)
Ha ha ha ha (ahh)
Sonny t., yeah, f**kin' with me, right (mmm)
Wait 'til he gets a couple of sips of that hallucination rain
Ha ha ha ha
Ain't gonna be not nice, not nice
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
Boy
