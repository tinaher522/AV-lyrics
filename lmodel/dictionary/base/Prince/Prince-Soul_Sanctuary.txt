<song artist="Prince" title="Soul_Sanctuary">
Loving u in silence
Knowing that it's right
Under ur gaze I ponder this love 2night
Unbothered by the chaos
Swirling 'round outside
In ur arms is where I want 2 live and die
Some place where ur face
Is all that I c
Where the love we make intoxicates intensively
And the mirror where ur sweet
Reflection used 2 b
There is hope, there is joy
My soul sanctuary
My soul sanctuary
Loving u in silence
Never ending kiss
Under ur gaze I can peacefully exist
Sanctuary, baby
Nothing compares 2 this
In my darkest hour
U can b my bliss
All of me I give to thee
Down at ur feet
The reassurance in ur rhythm
Speaks 2 me
Over and over
Ur screams r like a prayer
In the dawn u r there
My soul sanctuary
My soul sanctuary
Loving u in passion
Unmolested in this garden
Mango and nectarine
Sweet honeydew, I beg ur pardon
My mouth runneth over
From ecstacy, it's true
Baby, I love the taste of u
Loving u in silence
Knowing that it's right
Under ur gaze I ponder this love 2night
Unbothered by the chaos
Swirling around outside
In ur arms is where
I wanna live and die
Some place where ur face
Is all that I c
Where the love we make intoxicates intensively
And the mirror where ur sweet
Reflection used 2 b
There is hope, there is joy
My soul sanctuary
My soul sanctuary
My soul sanctuary
My soul sanctuary
Soul sanctuary
