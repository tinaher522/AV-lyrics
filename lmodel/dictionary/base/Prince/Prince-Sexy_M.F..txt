Yo man
What?
She came
Where?
There
Oh
In a word or two it's you I wanna do
No not cha body, yo mind you fool
Come here baby, yeah
You sexy motherfucker
We're all alone in a villa on the Rivera
That's in France on the south side
In case you cared
Out of all yo friends I wanna be the closest
That's why I tell you things
So you'll be the mostest
When it comes to life, to be this man's wife
You got to be well educated on the subject of fights
I mean prevention of
In other words its R.E.A.L meaning of this thing called love
Are you up on this?
If so, then you can get up off hug and a kiss
Come here baby, yeah
You sexy motherfucker
Come here baby, yeah
You sexy motherfucker
We need to talk about things
Tell me what cha do, tell me what cha eat
I might cook for you
See it really don't matter 'cause it's all about me and you
Ain't no one else around
I'm even with the blindfold, gagged and bound
I don't mind
See this ain't about sex
It's all about love being in charge of this life
And the next
Why all the cosmic talk?
I just want you smarter than I'll ever be
When we take that walk
Come here baby, yeah
You sexy motherfucker
Come here baby, yeah
You sexy motherfucker
Horns stand please
I like it, I like it
You seem perplexed I haven't taken you yet
Can't you see I'm harder than a man can get
I got wet dreams comin' out of my ears
I get hard if the wind blows your cologne near me
But I can take it, 'cause I want the whole nine
This ain't about the body, it's about the mind
Come here baby, yeah
You sexy motherfucker
Come here baby, yeah
You sexy motherfucker
Tommy Barbarella in the house
Scrub the dishes
Come here Tommy, yeah
Sexy, sexy, sexy, sexy
Levi, Levi, fly
(Oh man, let's give 'em some more good shit)
I like it, I like it
Sexy motherfucker shakin' that ass, shakin' that ass, shakin' that ass (x2)
Guard your folks and get your daughter
(Sexy motherfucker shakin' that ass, shakin' that ass, shakin' that ass)
The sexy motherfucker's so fine I could drink her bathwater
A long, leggy 5'8"
(Sexy motherfucker shakin' that ass, shakin' that ass, shakin' that ass)
Packing an ass as tight as a grape
I want to spit some game but I said to myself
Hmmm, just conversate (yeah)
(Sexy motherfucker shakin' that ass, shakin' that ass, shakin' that ass)
'Cause I'm usually quite the calm one (come on)
You never found me out prowling boy
I'm just havin' fun
(Sexy motherfucker shakin' that ass, shakin' that ass, shakin' that ass)
But I'm happy to change my state of mind for this behind
I bet that if you threw that ass into the air it would turn into sunshine
Sexy motherfucker
That would make shakin' that ass
For one sexy motherfucker shakin' this place, shakin' that ass,
shakin' that ass
Sexy motherfucker shakin' that ass, shakin' that ass, shakin' that ass (x3)
You sexy motherfucker
Sexy motherfucker (x8)
You sexy motherfucker
Sexy motherfucker (x3)
