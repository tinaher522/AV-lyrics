<song artist="Prince" title="Another_Boy">
Every time another boy speaks
If they catchin' feelin's and they wanna get with me
I don't hear no evil or see it, don't matter anyway
'Cause they'll never be with me
I got what I want and he's home
Waitin' on me to call him on the phone
To ask him what he wants from the store
I give him what he needs and baby so much more
Ain't another man that can make me love him
'Cause I only place God and the sky above him
He's the one that brings me joy
As long as we're together there'll never be another boy
Everywhere we go people stare
They could be jealous but I just don't care
Perception ain't really the truth
They could never ever take me away from you
Every time another boy pass
Think about how sad I was in the past
Hopin' with a knife in my back
That everythin' was cool but he was makin' plans
Just another failed romance
'Cause a one trick pony ain't got no chance
Don't need any other toy 'cause baby you're my lover
There'll never be another boy
Sister and my mother, father and my brother
This is what the difference will be
The only one that lasts through all of history
Every time another boy speaks
Kind words of praise or fantasy
To me they're just another boy
And not the coolest boy who brings me joy
'Cause I got him
(There'll never be another boy)
Yes, it's you baby like water for chocolate
(There'll never be another boy)
I'll do anythin', anythin' to make you see
(There'll never be another boy)
That you're the only, only one for me
(There'll never be another boy)
I like the smell of your sweet cologne
The I don't care style of your hair
(There'll never be another boy)
Just ask and I'll cook the things you like
When them other girls cupboard's just bare
(There'll never be another boy)
Yes, it is, you see this, you got it
(There'll never be another boy)
I said it's you babe like water for chocolate
Forever baby
(There'll never be another boy)
