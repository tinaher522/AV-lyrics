Girl
U excite me so
Oohwee baby, your body's like no other
Girl
It's U I gotta know (Gotta know)
Oohwee baby, I bet you're quite a lover
Girl (Ooh girl)
I wanna take U home
Oohwee baby U dream I scream inside U
I want U in the worst way
U make me....
Girl
Girl
Girl
Won't U kiss me?
Oohwee baby, my lips they want U so
Girl
How can U resist me? (How can U resist me?)
The smell of animal lust is a-all over me
(The smell of animal lust is a-all over me)
Oh, girl
If I could hold your hand
I'd make U touch my body until U understand
I'm your man (I'm your man)
All night, all day (All night, all day)
I want U in the worst way
U make me... (U make me)
Caress the flower
Warm, warm
Bring it to the garden
The garden
Be poetic
Tell me what it feels like...
A sea of electricity?
Now that's wonderful
Talk 2 U? Talk 2 U?
What do U wanna hear?
If I was anything else I'd be the water in your bath, darling
(Girl) Girl
U excite me so
Oohwee baby, my flesh is on fire (Oohwee baby, my flesh is on fire)
(Girl) Girl
The way U play with it
Oohwee baby, I think U desire me (Oohwee baby, I think U desire me)
Girl
Make a wish, baby (Make a wish, baby)
Anything (Anything)
We'll make it come true (Come true, come true)
Me and U (Me and U)
I want U in the worst way
U make me....
Ooh, girl
(Girl)
(Girl)
U like the dreamy ice cream
Girl, your lips r so wet (Girl)
Feel my hands, they're all sweaty (Girl)
(*single version fades here*)
I don't know, I, I guess U frighten me
'Cuz I've never wanted anyone like this before
To feel this way it's like, I don't know, it's like a sin
'Cuz sometimes I feel bad
Sometimes I want U so much I can--
God. All I have 2 do is think about U and I can have an orgasm
That sounds funny, doesn't it? Ha-ha
Marry me
Yeah that's right, marry me
Girl
Don't U ever get lonely sometimes? (Girl)
Gir-girl, don't U ever--
Don't U ever want someone--
Don't U ever want someone just 2--
Don't U ever want someone just 2 talk 2?
Well U can talk 2 me, baby
I'm--I'm a good listener
U know what?
U know what else?
U know what else I am?
U know what else I am, I am?
I'm a good kisser 2.
C'mere. Closer.
C'mere, closer.
Closer.
C'mere. C'mere.
Your ass is so tight.
Shhhh. C'mere baby. C'mere.
That's it. Right there.

Darlin' I-- I'll never--
