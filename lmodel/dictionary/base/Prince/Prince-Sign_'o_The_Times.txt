<song artist="Prince" title="Sign_'o_The_Times">
Oh yeah
In France, a skinny man died of a big disease with a little name
By chance his girlfriend came across a needle and soon she did the same
At home there are 17-year-old boys and their idea of fun
Is being in a gang called The Disciples
High on crack and totin' a machine gun
Time
Times
Hurricane Annie ripped the ceiling of a church and killed everyone inside
You turn on the telly and every other story is tellin' you somebody died
A sister killed her baby 'cuz she couldn't afford to feed it
And yet we're sending people to the moon
In September, my cousin tried reefer for the very first time
Now he's doing horse, it's June
Times
Times
It's silly, no?
When a rocket ship explodes and everybody still wants to fly
But some say a man ain't happy unless a man truly dies
Oh why?
Time
Time
Baby make a speech, Star Wars fly
Neighbors just shine it on
But if a night falls and a bomb falls
Will anybody see the dawn?
Time
Times
Is it silly, no?
When a rocket blows and, and everybody still wants to fly
Some say a man ain't happy truly until a man truly dies
Oh why, oh why
Sign 'o the times
Time
Time
Sign 'o the times mess with your mind
Hurry before it's to late
Let's fall in love, get married, have a baby
We'll call him Nate
If it's a boy
Time
Times
Time
Times
