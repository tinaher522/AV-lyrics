<song artist="Prince" title="Tangerine">
Some days I feel tangerine
Some days I feel blue
Some days I just wanna back out of the thing I feel for you
And even though I take your picture everywhere I go,
I use it for a coaster and drink the overflow
Some days I make a lot of money and give it all away
To take my mind off the tangerine colour of your negligee
Beggers can't be choosey if they don't know how to serve
You've got a different phone number and a lot of nerve
Some days I feel tangerine
Some days I miss you too
