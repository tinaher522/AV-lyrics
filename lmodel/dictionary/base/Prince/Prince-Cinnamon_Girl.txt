<song artist="Prince" title="Cinnamon_Girl">
As war drums beat in Babylon
Cinnamon girl starts 2 pray
Eye've never heard a prayer like this 1
Never b4 that day
Tearful words of love 4 people she had never met b4
Asking God 2 grant them mercy in this face of a holy war
Cinnamon Girl
Cinnamon Girl
Cinnamon Girl of mixed heritage
Never knew the meaning of color lines
911 turned that all around
When she got accused of this crime
So began the mass illusion, war on terror alibi 
What's the use when the god of confusion keeps on telling the same lie? 
Cinnamon Girl
Cinnamon Girl
Don't cry, don't shed no tears
1 night won't make us feel
'Cause we know how this movie's ending
Cinnamon Girl
As war drums beat in Babylon
And scorch the blood red sky
Militants bomb the foreign gun
Both sides truly die
Cinnamon Girl opens the book she knows will settle all the scores
Then she prays after the war that there will not b anymore
Cinnamon Girl, hey
Cinnamon Girl, yeah
Cinnamon Girl, don't worry baby, it's gonna be alright
Cinnamon Girl
