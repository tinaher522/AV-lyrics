<song artist="Prince" title="Scandalous">
Come closer
Feel what U been dyin' 4
Don't be afraid, baby
Touch it and explode
Understand, understand that I love U
Ah, but more than that - I want U
Everybody always told me good things come 2 those who wait
But I've got so much on the menu
I just can't, I just can't, I can't wait, baby
I can't wait, baby
Till I can wrap my legs all around U girl
Cuz sugar, U know U're just the kind of lover
That I've been lookin' 4
2night why don't we skip all the foreplay, mama
And just get down here on the floor
CHORUS:
Scandalous - I'm talkin' 'bout U and me
Marvelous - baby, baby, can't U see?
Anything U ever dreamed of, I'm willing 2 be
2night is gonna be scandalous
Cuz 2night I'm gonna be your fantasy
(Dear, my, my)
My dearest, my dearest
(Whisper) Whisper a question
With my body (body), I'll scream a reply
Anything's acceptable
Just ask me and I'll try it
2 hell with hesitations
2 hell with the reasons why
CHORUS
Baby, baby, baby
Oh girl, the things U make me do
Genius is the only way 2 describe U
Anything U ever dreamed of, baby
Just ask me - I'll do, I'll do, I'll do it 4 U, baby
Anything at all
Spirits rise and spirits fall
Anything U ever dreamed of, I'm willing 2 be
2night is gonna be scandalous
Cuz 2night I'm, 2night I'm gonna be your fantasy!
CHORUS
Scandalous
Marvelous
