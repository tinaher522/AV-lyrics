<song artist="Prince" title="Peace">
Artist - somebody didn't hear me 
(What'd he say?) 
Artist - formerly known as Prince
You gotta get your peace on
Peace, whoa oh
Peace
That's what we're here for
And not to war 
When the war upon people of color thru needles
Designed to disease instead of relieve 
When it ceases
I'll be a man of peace 
(Say what)
When this mask of vendetta
Like tears on the face of Coretta 
Roll down and go away
I'll be happier 
(Happier)
I'll be a man of peace 
Everybody say!
Peace, whoa oh
Peace
That's what we're here for 
(That's what we're here for)
And not to war 
When the time that we spend
Watching TV depends on 
Whether or not it destroy or transcend
Then I won't need 
(I won't, I won't)
Won't need a warranty 
When the power of the hour is not yours but is ours 
And the faces we see reflect all that we be indeed 
There'll be a jubilee 
Everybody say
Peace, whoa oh
Peace
That's what we're here for 
(That's what we're here for)
And not to war
Bass 
(Talkin' about freedom)
The rewards that we share will be based on what's fair 
And not the curliness or the thick of our hair
Real competition, if you dare! 
Music is our middle name
And we don't wanna play your game 
So when the mergers you make are with us
And you take a fair slice of the cake
That we bake then you break 
That would be real cool
But y'all wanna act like fools! 
(What's up with that?)
Can't we all just get along? 
And have peace, whoa oh
Peace
That's what we're here for 
And not to war
Peace
Peace
Peace, whoa oh
Peace 
That's what we're here for
And not to war 
In case some of y'all didn't hear it right
I didn't call him, his name wasn't the artist 
Artist, Artist
Artist - every syllable must be heard 
Artist - formerly known as Prince
You got to get your peace in 
Y'all tryin' to start something up in here
