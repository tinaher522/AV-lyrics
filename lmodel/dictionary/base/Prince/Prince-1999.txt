<song artist="Prince" title="1999">
I was dreamin' when I wrote this
Forgive me if it goes astray
But when I woke up this mornin'
Could have sworn it was Judgment Day
The sky was all purple
There were people runnin' everywhere
Tryin' to run from the destruction
You know I didn't even care
They say two thousand zero, zero
Party over
Oops, out of time
So tonight I'm gonna party like it's 1999
I was dreamin' when I wrote this
So sue me if I go too fast
But life is just a party
And parties weren't meant to last
War is all around us
My mind says prepare to fight
So if I gotta die
I'm gonna listen to my body tonight, yeah
They say two thousand zero, zero
Party over
Oops, out of time
So tonight I'm gonna party like it's 1999
Yeah
Let me tell you somethin'
If you didn't come to party
Don't bother knockin' on my door
I got a lion in my pocket
And baby, he's ready to roar, yeah
Yeah, everybody's got a bomb
We could all die any day, ow
But before I'll let that happen
I'll dance my life away, whoa
They say two thousand zero, zero
Party over
Oops, out of time
(We're runnin' outta time)
So tonight I'm gonna party like it's 1999, ow
Say it one more time
Two thousand zero, zero
Party over
Oops, out of time
So tonight I'm gonna party like it's 1999
1999, don't you wanna go?
1999, don't you wanna go?
1999, we could all die here today
