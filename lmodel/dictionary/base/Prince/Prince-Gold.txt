<song artist="Prince" title="Gold">
There's a mountain and it's mighty high
You cannot see the top unless you fly
There's a molehill on proven ground
Ain't nowhere to go if you hang around
Everyone wants to sell whats already been sold
Everyone wants to tell whats already been told
What's the use of money if you ain't gonna break the mould
Even at the centre of the fire, there is cold
All that glitters, ain't gold
All that glitters, ain't gold
There's an ocean of despair
There are people living there
They're unhappy each and every day
But hell is not fashion so what you trying to say
Everyone wants to sell whats already been sold
Everyone wants to tell whats already been told
What's the use of money if you ain't gonna break the mould
Even at the centre of the fire, there is cold
All that glitters, ain't gold
All that glitters, ain't gold
There's a lady 99 years old
If she led a good life heaven takes her soul
That's the theory and if you don't wanna know
Step aside and make a way for those who want to go
Everyone wants to sell whats already been sold
Everyone wants to tell whats already been told
What's the use of being young if you ain't gonna get old
Even at the centre of the fire, there is cold
All that glitters, ain't gold
All that glitters, ain't gold
All that glitters
All that glitters
All that glitters
Ain't gold
