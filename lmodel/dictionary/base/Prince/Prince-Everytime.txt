<song artist="Prince" title="Everytime">
Lights in the shadow of a darkened room
His face lit under the glow of the moon
Fingers windin' circles in my hair
Holdin' me in his penetratin' stare
I ain't goin' nowhere
Just one touch and I'm runnin' hot
I'm about to die but I don't wanna stop
I breathe in your sweet love satisfied
Then we kiss and it's so divine everytime
He takes my breath 'cause he takes his time
He takes my soul, body and mind
He takes what he wants and that's just fine
He takes my breath everytime
He slides his fingers cross my lips
Like drawin' a map into his kiss
Divine, so fine everytime
He takes my breath 'cause he takes his time
He takes my soul, body and mind
He takes what he wants and that's just fine
He takes my breath everytime, everytime
