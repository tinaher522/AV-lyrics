<song artist="Prince" title="Chaos_And_Disorder">
(check check, ok cool, rolling)
(Hey)
(Yeah)
Carjack used 2 fix flat tires (Get your ass out of the car now!)
Cadillac used 2 be a Benz (hey, get out of the street)
Big joints never gotcha higher
Freebase cost U in the end
I'm just a no-name reporter
I wish I had nothing 2 say
Looking through my new camcorder
Trying 2 find a crime that pays
I get hit by mortars, everywhere I go I'm loitering
Chaos and disorder ruinin' my world 2day
He's gay used 2 mean he's happy
Nowadays happy ain't allowed (alright)
U're played used to mean top 40 
(You're listening to WNPG and we will [?] chaos)
Now 40 days of being played ain't proud
I'm just a no-name reporter
I wish I had nothing 2 say
Lookin' through my new camcorder
Trying 2 find a crime that pays
I get hit by mortars, everywhere I go I'm loitering
Chaos and disorder ruinin' my world 2day
(Yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Safe sex used 2 mean no babies
When intercourse used to mean fun
If I had 15 ladies
I would only fuck with 1
I get hit by a mortar, everywhere I go I'm loitering
Chaos and disorder [rulin'/ruinin'] my world today
(good guys, look the way [...] coming down here)
([...] fuck [...] we belong)
([...] senora [...])
(I'm not gonna tell her [...] a lot of work to do)
Yeah, yeah, yeah [(...)]
yeah, yeah, yeah (yeah)
(oh whoa no no no)
(hey)
