Hey, look me over
Tell me do you like what you see?
Hey, I ain't got no money
But honey I'm rich on personality
Hey, check it all out
Baby I know what it's all about
Before the night is through
You will see my point of view
Even if I have to scream and shout
Baby I'm a (star)
Might not know it now
Baby but I are, I'm a (star)
I don't want to stop, 'til I reach the top
Sing it (we are all stars!)
Hey, take a listen
Tell me do you like what you hear?
If it don't turn you on
Just say the word and I'm gone
But honey I know, ain't nothing
Wrong with your ears
Hey, check it all out
Better look now or it just might be too late (just might be too late)
My luck's gonna change tonight
There's gotta be a better life
Take a picture sweetie
I ain't got time to waste
Cuz baby I'm a (star)
Might not know it now
Baby but I are, I'm a (star)
I don't want to stop, 'til I reach the top
Sing it! (We are all stars!)
Everybody say, nothing come 2 easy
But when u got it baby, nothing come 2 hard
You'll see what I'm all about (see what I'm all about)
If I gotta scream and shout (if I gotta scream and shout)
Baby baby (baby) baby (baby) baby (baby)
Yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah (oh!)
Might not know it now
Baby but I are, I'm a (star)
I don't want to stop, 'til I reach the top
Sing it! (star)
Baby baby baby
Oh baby I'm a (star)
Baby baby baby
Somebody
(We are all a star)
(Baby I'm a star)
We are all a star
We are all a star
Doctor!
Baby, baby, baby, baby,
Baby, baby, baby, baby
We are all stars
