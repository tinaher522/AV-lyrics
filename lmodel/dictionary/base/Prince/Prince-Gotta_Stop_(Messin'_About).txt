<song artist="Prince" title="Gotta_Stop_(Messin'_About)">
{B-side of Let's Work}
Sittin' outside your door, about to break down
Fourth time this week somebody's come around
Who's it gonna be tonight, who's the lucky man
Where you get the attitude, I'll never understand
Uh Oh, here he comes now, so happy that he came
Hey! Was it good boy? [Thoughts on, of her aim]
What goes on inside your head that makes you want to take them all to bed?
Gotta stop, gotta gotta stop, messin about
U know u gotta stop, gotta gotta stop, messin about
When I call u on the phone, you act so unconcerned
(I wanna) I wanna get you all alone (ooh baby) to show u what I've learned
Why u won't give me the time of day, u won't give me some time,
U won't give me anything, god u think u're too fine
Can't u see? All I want is a little time,
I've been playing with my toy so much I'm gonna go blind.
Gotta stop, gotta gotta stop, messin about
U gotta stop, gotta gotta stop, messin about
Gotta stop, gotta gotta stop, messin about
U gotta stop, gotta gotta stop, messin about
U gotta stop, gotta gotta stop, messin about
U do it too much
U gotta stop, gotta gotta stop, messin about
Stop!
