<song artist="Prince" title="Mutiny">
Get off!
Baby, when U went away
U stayed away 2 long
Baby, what can I say?
No one does me wrong (And gets away with it)
Mutiny!
I said I'm takin' over
U gotta give up the ship
U gotta take a little trip
I'm talkin' mutiny!
I said I'm takin' over
U gotta give up the ship
U should've been a little more hip
Now baby, when U talk 2 me
U don't have much 2 say
Baby, why can't we be
Lost in love like yesterday?
I'm talkin' mutiny!
I said I'm takin' over
U gotta give up the ship
U gotta take a little trip
I'm talkin' mutiny!
I said I'm takin' over
U gotta give up the ship
U should've been a little more ...
Darlin', darlin' with unity
Huh, no one, but no one could make us fall
Darlin', now there's mutiny
Huh, maybe U should have called
Get off! {x2}
Mutiny!
I said I'm takin' over, huh
U gotta give up the ship
U gotta take a little trip
I'm talkin' mutiny!
I said I'm takin' over
U gotta give up the ship
U should've been a little more ...
Get off! {x2}
Baby, U treated me
Like some unwanted child
Baby, it's all over now
I loved U all the while
I'm talkin' mutiny!
I said I'm takin' over
U gotta give up the ship
U gotta take a little trip
I'm talkin' mutiny!
I'm takin' over
U gotta give up the ship
U should've been a little more ...
Get off! {x4}
Vogue
All the way vogue {repeat 2 fade}
(Say it y'all)
([U know I'm bullshittin', I'll keep it all])
(Morris, did U give?)
([Miko], did U give?)
(Lord)
