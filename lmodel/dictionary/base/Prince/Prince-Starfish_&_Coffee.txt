<song artist="Prince" title="Starfish_&_Coffee">
It was 7:45 we were all in line
To greet the teacher Miss Kathleen
First was Kevin, then came Lucy, third in line was me
All of us were ordinary compared to Cynthia Rose
She always stood at the back of the line 
A smile beneath her nose
Her favorite number was 20
And every single day
If U asked her what she had for breakfast
This is what she'd say
Starfish &amp; Coffee
Maple syrup and jam
Butterscotch clouds and a tangerine
A side order of ham
If U set u're mind free baby
Maybe u'll understand
Starfish &amp; Coffee
Maple syrup and jam
Cynthia wore the prettiest dress but different color socks
Sometimes, I wondered if the mates were in her lunchbox
Me and Lucy opened it when Cynthia wasn't around
Lucy cried, I almost died
U know what we found?
Starfish &amp; Coffee
Maple syrup and jam
Butterscotch clouds, a tangerine
And a side order of ham
If U set u're mind free baby
Maybe u'll understand
Starfish &amp; Coffee
Maple syrup and jam  oh - oh
(Starfish &amp; Coffee)
Cynthia had a happy face
Just like the one she draws
On every wall, in every school but it's alright
It's for a worthy cause
Go on Cynthia!
Keep sayin'
Starfish &amp; Coffee
Maple syrup and jam 
Butterscotch clouds, a tangerine
A side order of ham
If U set u're mind free baby
Maybe u'll understand
Starfish &amp; Coffee
Maple syrup and jam, Oh - oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
