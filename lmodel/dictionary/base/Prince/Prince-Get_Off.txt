<song artist="Prince" title="Get_Off">
{B-side of N.P.G.}
New power
Let down your funky...
Get off
Get off baby
What can a brother do when the clock keeps ticking you off
Turn the other cheek or kick a nut 'til it coughs
get off
get off
On the positive tip, I'm equipped with a whip
I don't have to spank you 'cause this is my ship
get off
get off
(get off baby)
I will still be hip, when the words from your lip
take a dip in the ratings
And I'll be stripping your Mercedes
of your Lubricated Lady
and taking her for a walk, taking her for a walk
On the positive tip, I'm equipped with a whip
I don't have to spank you 'cause this is my ship
get off
get off
get off
get off
uh, is this a dream?
Nooo
Everybody get off
Is this a dream?
Is this a dream?
get-o-get-o-get-o-get off
On the positive tip, I'm equipped with a whip
I don't have to spank you 'cause this is my ship
get off
get off (I got the best of you)
get off (hey, hey sugar)
get off
Once I give her back to ya,
she won't ever wanna do ya
cause I wrote the book
I taught her how to look
She showed me the money you gave her, I took
I even ate her cooking, that's more than you did
get off
get off
What can a brother do when the clock keeps ticking you off
Turn the other cheek or kick a nut 'til it coughs
get off (uh, help me)
get off
get, get, get off
New, new, new Power
{repeated over and over}
