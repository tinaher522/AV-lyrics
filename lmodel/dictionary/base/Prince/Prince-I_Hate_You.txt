<song artist="Prince" title="I_Hate_You">
You have just accessed the hate experience
Do you wish to change your entry?
Very well, please enjoy your experience
I never thought that you would be the one
After all the things that we've been through
You gave your body to another in the name of fun
I hope you had some, baby, if not, boo hoo
It's so sad but I hate you like a day without sunshine
It's so bad but I hate you 'cuz you're all that's ever on my mind
Honey, I hate you, now everyday would be a waste of time
'Cuz I hate you
I never thought that I could feel this way
To fall in love was a table reserved for fools
Say you're sorry if you wanna but it's all in vain
I'm out the door sweet baby, that's right, we're through
It's so sad but I hate you like a day without sunshine
It's so bad but I hate you 'cuz you're all that's ever on my mind
Honey, I hate you, now everyday would be a waste of time
'Cuz I hate you
This court is now in session, would the defendant please rise?
State your name for the court, never mind
(Billy Jack bitch)
You're being charged with one too many counts of heartbreaking
In the 1st degree, I don't give a damn about the others
My main concern is you and me
Your honor, may I call to the stand my one and only witness?
A girl that know damn well, she didn't have no damn business
I know what you did, how you did it and who you did it with
So you might as well take your time 'cuz you sure can't plead the 5th
Now raise your right hand, do you swear to tell the whole truth
Not the half truth like you used to, so help you God?
Nod your head one time if you hear me
If you don't, I'll have to use the rod
Anything to make you see that you're gonna miss me
Yeah, you're gonna miss me
If it please the court
I'd like to have the defendant place her hands behind her back
So I can tie her up tight and get into the act
The act of showing her how good it used to be
I want it to be so good she falls back in love with me
Close your eyes, I'm gonna cover your ass with this sheet
And I want you to pump your hips like you used to
And baby, you better stay on the beat
Did you do to your other man the same things that you did to me?
Right now I hate you so much I wanna make love until you do see
That it's killin' me, baby, to be without you
'Cuz all I ever wanted to do was to be with you
I hate you
(I hate you)
Because I love you
(Because I love you)
But I can't love you
(I can't love you)
Because I hate you
(I hate you)
Because I love you
I love you, baby
I love you, I love you, I love you
I love you 'cuz you're all that's ever on my mind
I hate you because I love you
