<song artist="Prince" title="Time">
This song's about time
Says it's about time
About time that U are around
I think it's 'bout time
That I got time alone with U, yeah yeah
I think I'm running out of patience
I think I'm running out of lies
I think it's 'bout time I tell the truth
Instead of these alibi's
Well, I think it's 'bout time
That I got time alone with U, babe
'Cause U're so fine, when I get mine
Baby U can 2
No more peace and quiet, I wonder why
A party full of drunken fools
I betcha some will be the rushing tide
Splashin' all over U, u, u, u, u
I don't wanna work another day baby
No no (stay with me)
I wish U're gonna stay with me (stay with me)
I don't think it matters anyway (it don't matter girl)
For U R as rich as I can be, baby baby
I think it's 'bout time
That I got time alone with U
I know U know
'Cause U're so fine, when I get mine
Baby U can 2, sho 'nuff
Sugar well...
I'm thinking that U really need 2 B my pet
And let me put U in my 'lil cage, c'mon
I'm sick and tired of playing hard 2 get
With an animal that's half my age
Sugar, well well
My head's a little dizzy
My head's spinning 'round ('round and 'round and)
Another dirty hotel room
Another lonely town (lonely town)
I need some time with
I need some time with U
This is what it feels like
U know what I wanna do
This is what it feels like
C'mon lemme tell U one time
Said I think it's 'bout time
That I got time alone with U
Baby, baby
'Cause U're so fine, when I get mine
Baby U can 2, yeah yeah
Ooh ooh, I think I need U 2 B my girl
Travel with me around the world (baby, baby)
'Cause on paper, this works out fine
(So fine, so fine, so fine, so fine)
But not half as fine as when I get time with U
'Bout time (sugar have U heard)
Got time alone with U (keep breaking you down, down)
So fine, get mine
Baby U can 2
'Bout time, got time alone with U (U, U, U, U, U)
So fine, (yeah), get mine
Baby U can 2
Baby, baby, U can 2
Ooh ooh oooh
