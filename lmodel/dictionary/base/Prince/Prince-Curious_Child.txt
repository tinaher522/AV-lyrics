<song artist="Prince" title="Curious_Child">
In a room full of harlots and fantasy
Destiny beckoned us there
Curious child on the balcony
We took the dare
Careless I was 2 caress thee
Yet never regretting the touch
The joy that we shared, it was meant 2 be
And not a crime
No, it's not a crime
If memory serves us, we will allign
2 the truth that we most often share
Curious child, u are on my mind
Do u care?
