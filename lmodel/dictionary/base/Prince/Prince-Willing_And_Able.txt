<song artist="Prince" title="Willing_And_Able">
Said I'm willin' and I'm able
I'm ready 2 place my cards on the table
I've been holdin' back this feelin' 
4 far 2 long
Now that I'm willin', it's a fact
Is truly mighty strong
Like a child lost in the wilderness
'Till I reach my destination, I won't rest
Cuz I'm willin' (willin')
and I'm able (able)
I'm ready 2 place my cards on the table (table)
There's some kings in my deck and a queen or 2
So u know there ain't nothin', 
Nothin' that I wouldn't do (Nothin' that I wouldn't do)
It 'twas a long time coming, 
but now that it's here
All the non-believers better fear me
Cuz I'm willin (willin' and able)
and I'm able
I got good and plenty cards 
2 place on the table (table)
Been holdin' back this feeling 4 far 2 long
(Been holdin' back this feeling 4 far 2 long)
Now that I'm willing, (this feelin')
This feelin'
It's truly mighty strong (truly, I... I)
I'm willing (willin') 
and able (able)
My vision is all clear, I'm feelin' kinda stable
U know I am, u know I am
Ready 2 whisper (whisper, whatcha say)
Ready 2 shout (shout, now whatcha say)
Ready 2 scream (scream, now whatcha say)
from the highest mountain top (whatcha say, whatcha say)
Lord, I'm willing and able
I wanna dance and sing, somebody watch me do my thing
(willin')
(able)
(willin' and able)
(willin')
(able)
(willin' and able)
I wanna dance and sing, somebody watch me do my thing
(dance and sing, let me watch u do your thing)
(bring it to me)
Let me take a bite
2 see if u're ripe
I'm kinda thinkin' about
takin' a hunk, chunk
a piece of your love tonight
Well hello, MC T on a mello
swing low to the tempo
as I flow on a roll
here we go, willing and able
start the show right
with that type of hype
lay my cards on the table tonite
don't take me light 
my flow hits u just like a lead pipe
while I'm clockin'
u just say 'fess
about the boots I'm knockin'
it ain't like that
(somethin' to keep the Jimmy so get) off my back
in fact u lack the knack
step back before I show u how a fool acts, baby
yeah
