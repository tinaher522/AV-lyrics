<song artist="Prince" title="Morning_Papers">
He realized that she was new 2 love
Naive in every way
Every school boy's fantasy she was
That's why he had 2 wait
If he poured his heart in2 a glass
And offered it like wine
She could drink and be back in time
4 the morning papers
They could take a walk down the oceanside
Make a wish every wave
They could find a carousel and ride
Or kiss in every cave
They could contemplate the entire universe
Or just 1 star
Or just how far was the walk
4 the morning papers
Why is age more than a number
When it comes 2 love?
Should we ask the 1's who speculate
When they don't know what it's made of?
Should we ask the moonlight on ur face
Or the raindrops in ur hair?
Or should we ask The Man who wrote it there
In the morning papers?
Should we ask the moonlight on ur face
Or the raindrops in ur hair?
Or should we ask The Man
Who wrote it there in the morning papers?
