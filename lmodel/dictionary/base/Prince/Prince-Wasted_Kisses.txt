<song artist="Prince" title="Wasted_Kisses">
Chorus:
Why did I waste my kisses on u, baby? 
Why did I waste my kisses on u now? 
Why did I waste my kisses on u, baby? 
Why did I waste my kisses on u now? 
Overdue ¨c that's how I described the hour
The minute, the moment that I first laid eyes on u
I guess I knew that sooner or later this power
Would manifest itself into a rendezvous
Small dark room ¨c that's where I let u smother
In front of your [gut, tell another]
Why should I care? 

Cheap perfume all over those burgundy stockings
The ones I tied u up with
I shoulda just left 'em there (shoulda just left 'em there)
Why'd I waste my kisses on u? 
Why did I waste my kisses on u, baby? 
Chorus
Why'd I waste my kisses on u, baby? (on u)
Why did I waste my kisses on u now? 
Why'd I waste my kisses on u, baby? (on u)
Why did I waste my kisses on u now?
