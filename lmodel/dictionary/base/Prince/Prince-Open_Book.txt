<song artist="Prince" title="Open_Book">
U said my heart's just like an open book
But there are lines U've never seen
U said that U could tell in a single look
But U never looked in between
Sometimes I wanted 2 keep U, sometimes I wanted your love
But I've awakened 2 the reality that sometimes is not enough
Oh, our separate dreams pulled us our separate ways
We were so different from the very start
2 me it was 4ever, 2 U it was just a phase
I'll give back your name if U give back my heart
CHORUS:
U said U'd take me 2 another world
I said U were only posing
U'd never be able 2 read this girl
So the open book is closing, closing, closing
Closing
Sometimes it felt so natural, sometimes it felt so right
It doesn't seem fair that U and I ever had a fight ... no!
Sometimes I wanted 2 keep U, sometimes I wanted your love
But I've awakened 2 the reality that sometimes is not enough
Oh, now your touch is a reminder like the thorns upon a rose
The beauty is mine if I can stand the cut
CHORUS {x2}
