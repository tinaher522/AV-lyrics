Finally, beloved, we meet at last
Middle of the here, never mind the past
Only way to get to where you've never been
Let's party like you ain't gon' party again
Let's funk
Let's roll
Get it turned up, get it out of control
Get into the rhythm, it's good for the soul
Let's funk
Let's roll
Get it turned up, get It out of control
Come on everybody, let's Funk and roll
Whether you're coming by bus or train
Shade throw us Hatin', 'cause they're going insane
I'm talking bout the million dollar party to the nickel and dime
Another motherfucker, you're committing a crime
Let's funk
Let's roll
Get it turned up, get it out of control
Get into the rhythm, it's good for the soul
Let's funk
Let's roll
Get it turned up, get it out of control
Come on everybody, let's funk and roll
The only way to last till the break of dawn
Is Put your phone down, get your Party on
Who you're gonna call when is obviously up
And every body you know is rocking it here
Let's funk
Let's roll
Get it turned up, get it out of control
Get into the rhythm, it's good for the soul
Let's funk
Let's roll
Get it turned up, get it out of control
Come on everybody, let's funk and roll
Oh yeah yeah yeah
Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo
Ooh we, ooh we
I don't really care what ya'll be doing
I don't really care what ya'll be doing
I don't really care

I don't really care what ya'll be doing
I don't really care what ya'll be doing
I don't really care
I don't really care
I don't really care what ya'll be doing
Let's funk
Let's roll
Get it turned up, get it out of control
Get into the rhythm, it's good for the soul
Let's funk, yes sir
Let's roll
Get it turned up, get it out of control
Come on everybody, let's funk and roll
