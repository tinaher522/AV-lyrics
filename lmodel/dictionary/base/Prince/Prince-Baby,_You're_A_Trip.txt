<song artist="Prince" title="Baby,_You're_A_Trip">
I know what people say
They say U don't know how 2 love
But I want U anyway
U're like a drug and I can't get enough
U'd be great in motion pictures
Cuz baby, U really got me blind
U're the only one I wanna see
U're the only one that does it 2 me every time
Baby, U're an ocean that's 2 wide 2 cross
And baby, U're the cross that's 2 deep 2 bear
Baby, U're the star that's 2 far away
Baby, U're a trip and a half, but I don't care
I know what people think
They think I'm a star struck little fool
Baby, U could be flat broke
I'd still be crazy 4 U
And I know that I'm in love
Cuz I'd change my whole life just 2 make U smile
And I still can't have U when I want
But when I do it's only 4 a little while
Baby, U're an ocean that's 2 wide 2 cross
Baby, U're the cross that's 2 deep 2 bear
Baby, U're the star that's 2 far away
Baby, U're a trip and a half, but I don't care
U see, it's in my diet
Something in the water don't compute
Baby, I'm quite happy after U give me love
U can see who's the fool
U're, U're an ocean 2 wide 2 cross
(Baby, U're an ocean that's 2 wide 2 cross)
(Baby, U're the cross that's 2 deep 2 bear)
U are the star that's 2 far away
(Baby, U're the star that's 2 far away)
(Baby, U're a trip, I don't care)
U're a trip and a half, a trip and a half, half
(Baby, U're a trip) {repeat in BG}
Oh yeah
U're a trip, yeah, and a half
I don't, I don't, I don't care, I don't care
Baby, baby, no no
U're a trip and a half, baby
Trip and a half
I'd do anything U want me 2 do, baby
I'd change my life 4 U, U
U are the star who's much 2 far away
I don't care cuz I.. I.. I.. I love U, love U, baby, oh yes
Yeah, yeah, yeah
U're a trip and a half, a half
U're a trip and a half
I.. I know those people say
They say U don't know how 2 love
But I want U anyway, baby, U're like a drug
I can't get enough cuz U
U'd be great in motion pictures, child
Cuz U really got me blind
U'd be the only one I wanna see
Only one that done it every time
I'd do the do with U
U're like an ocean much 2 wide 2 cross
U are the cross that's much 2 deep 2 bear
U are the star much 2 far away
But I don't care, U're a trip and a half
I want U every day, hey!
