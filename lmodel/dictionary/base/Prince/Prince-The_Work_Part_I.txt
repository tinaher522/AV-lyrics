<song artist="Prince" title="The_Work_Part_I">
Every time I watch the other people news
I see a false picture of myself, another one of you
They try to tell us what we want, what to believe
Didn't that happen in the Garden
When somebody spoke to Eve?
But I'm willing to do The Work
Willing to do what I gotta do
I'm willing to do The Work
Tell me now - what about you?
Look around and tell me your Sun is Risen
When ur brothers and sisters are in the Fall
What is left to give when our work is done?
What do we own besides the right to crawl?
See we're living in a system that the devil designed
And suffering from this devil's most heinous crime
He's tried to keep us from the reason we were born
That is to be the living truth in human for.
But I'm willing to do The Work
Willing to do what I gotta do
I'm willing to do The Work
Tell me now - what about you?
This work is not an easy task
But this is the work we must do for Revelation to come to pass
This work is the kind that turns your back on the Ruling Class
By putting them in their place just like the past
Taste it, ain't it sweet sweet?
Gotta lotta work to do
Taste it, ain't it sweet sweet?
Gotta lotta work to do
Nothing can stop us
Whatever's in our way
We got to go through it to get to it
I heard somebody say,
"I'm willing to do The Work
Willing to do what I gotta do
I'm willing to do The Work
Tell me now - what about you?"
Thank you
