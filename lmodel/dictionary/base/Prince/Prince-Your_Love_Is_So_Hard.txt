Date line: 1989
I thought I was your lover wild
But U treat me like a step-child
I waited by the telephone
I knew U weren't alone
U wait until it's Friday night
And U call me up and start a fight
Say U and me ain't workin' out
But U'll be free on Sunday, what's this all about?
I don't know, baby, who U think I am
I'm not your average every day simple Sam
I could have a dozen others if I choose
But no other mama will do
Your love is so hard
Your love, your love is so hard
Baby, I like it
I thought we were the perfect match
U were so fine, such a catch
Nights were nasty, days were hot
I gave it all and in return, dogged is what I got
I don't know, baby, who U think I am
I'm not your average every day simple Sam
I could have a dozen others if I choose
But no other mama will do
Your love is so hard
Your love, your love is so hard
Baby, I like it
Date line: 1989
Come here baby, it's time
Hey girl, U've been hurt before
Gimme a chance, don't slam the door
Brown lover, funky M
I come 2 play, not 2 swim
OK, roll over
(1989)
Don't be so hard
Sugar, U'd be missin' everything in life
Don't be so hard
Ooh baby, maybe U could be my wife
Now say it again... uh, hard
I don't know, baby, who U think I am (Believe me, U be)
I'm not your average everyday simple Sam (Uh, ooh, hard)
I could have a dozen others if I choose (Ooh baby)
No other mama will do
Your love is so hard
Your love, your love is so hard
Baby, I like it
Enough
Funky M
I don't know, baby, who U think I am
I'm not your average everyday simple Sam
I could have a dozen others if I choose (Date line: 1989)
No other mama will do (It's time)
Your love is so hard
Date line: 1989
(I don't, I don't know)
It's time U get enough
It's time U get, it's time U get, time U get, time U get enough
And U'll be beggin' "Please, don't be so hard"
(1989)
Your love is, your love is so hard (19.. 19.. 19..)
Your love is so hard (1989)
Please don't waste precious time (1989)
Your love, your love, your is so hard (19.. 19.. 19..)
Your love is so hard (1989)
Your love is so hard
