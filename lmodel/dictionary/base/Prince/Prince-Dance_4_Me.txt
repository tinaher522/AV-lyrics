<song artist="Prince" title="Dance_4_Me">
I like it when you dance 'cause it gets me hot
I like it when you shake everything you got
I like it when you dance 'cause it's so sexy
I like it when you dance for me
I like it when you think I'm all alone
Your the voice I hear from the telephone
Tellin' me all your deepest fantasies
I like it when you dance for me...hallelujah
I like it when I hear a knock
On my door
You are standing there in your Christian Dior
Dark sunglasses in the pale moonlight
I like it when the scene is right
You can take your wrap and lay it on the chair
If anybody finds it I don't care
What we do together makes history
I like it when you dance for me
Hallelujah
Your flamenco's are all like jazz
With every other sip of what's in your glass
The sexier you get
The more your into my stash
I like it when you dance for me
Hallelujah
(dance...dance for me...dance...dance for me)
I like it when you dance 'cause it gets me hot
I like it when you shake everything you got
I like it when you dance 'cause it's so sexy
I like it when you dance for me
Dance...dance...I like it when you dance for me
