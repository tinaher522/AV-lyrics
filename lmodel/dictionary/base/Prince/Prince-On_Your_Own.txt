<song artist="Prince" title="On_Your_Own">
Yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah
U probably wonderin' why I called U here
Somebody told me, mm, U were cryin' tears
Now I wanna know if this is true
Then tell me, baby, tell me, tell me
Why U wanna do the things U do?
Wanted everything that money could buy
Now U're broke and lonely and U don't know why
Don't bother callin' cuz there ain't nobody home
Mm, U're on your own (On your own)
Yeah, U're on your own (On your own)
Your love is gone (Love is gone)
U're on your own (On your own)
Listen...
She gave U diamonds
She gave U pearls
Ooh, she gave U boys, yes she did
She gave U girls, oh oh
She can't give U a love like this
The kinda lovin' that U can't resist
Don't bother callin' cuz there ain't nobody home
Mm, U're on your own (On your own)
U're on your own (On your own)
Looka here
La la la la la la la la la la la la, la da da, la da da, da {x2}
If I had a dime, ooh, and a nickel 2 (Ooh)
4 every wasted line that I heard from U (Ooh)
I could buy a mansion, oh yes I could, on a mountain top, ooh
Money, money, money jumpin' out of my pockets
It would never stop, ooh, help me Lord
U're fine as wine but if the truth be told
Won't nobody wantcha (when U're ass is old), U know it
U, U, U, U...
U're on your own (On your own)
Yeah, love is gone (Love is gone)
U're on your own (On your own)
Looka here
La la la la la la la la la la la la, la da da, la da da, da {x2}
Of all the years U've known me
3 times that and then some U owe me
Huh, U're on your own
Yeah, U're on your own
Ooh yeah (Ooh)
Your love is gone (On your own)
Your love is gone (Ooh)
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby (On your own)
Your love is gone (Ooh)
Keep on walkin', I ain't talkin' (On your own)
U're on your own (Ooh)
Keep on walkin', I ain't talkin' (On your own)
U're on your own (On your own)
1 (On your own)
2 (Love is gone)
3 (On your own)
I'm outta here, ha ha ha (On your own)
(On your own) {fade out}
(Love is gone)
(On your own)
