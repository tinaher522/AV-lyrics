<song artist="Prince" title="No_More_Candy_4_U">
Nine out of ten mortals agree today; 
To much fame causes spiritual decay
To all the punks who believe life imitates music
No more candy for you 
We can't hang with you
To all the punks who wanna be rock stars and do what they do
There's no future for you 
That's the life of a fool
No more candy, no more candy for 
You we're too funky and you can't handle our groove
To all the freaks in the magazines who never paid no dues
No more candy for you 
You can't sing it's true
To all the freaks walking into walls 
Somebody put a spell on you
No more candy for you I guess 
The devil got a brand new fool
To all the haterz on the internet 
Somebody's lookin' at you
No more candy for you 
They got your number now, fool
To all the suckerz winning anything 
And thanking the lord for what they do
No more candy for you 
No more candy for you
I am too funky and you can't handle my groove.
