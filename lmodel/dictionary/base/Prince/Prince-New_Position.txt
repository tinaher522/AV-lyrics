<song artist="Prince" title="New_Position">
Honey, we've been together,
Honey, for too long
Honey, we've got to make it better,
Honey, before we go wrong
Got to try a new position, yeah!
Something that'll make it all right
New position, yeah, let's go fishing in the river, the river of life
Honey, we can't last (we can't last)
Without a shot of new spunk (Ha)
Honey, forget your past (forget your past)
You've got to try my new funk
You've got to try a new position, yeah, something that'll make it all right
Oh, a new position, yeah, yeah, let's go fishing in the river, the river
of life
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh, let me do ya, come on let me do ya, do ya,
come one let me do ya,
I want, I want 2 do ya, do ya,
I can make u happy (I can make u H.A.P.P.Y)
I can make it real good (so good)
Honey, I won't be your pappy, (P.U.S.S.Y.)
but I'll do ya, I'll do ya, do ya, do ya, like a,
Do ya do ya like a good man should
I'll do ya do ya like a good man should
Honey, let's try a new position
