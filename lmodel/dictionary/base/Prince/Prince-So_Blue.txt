<song artist="Prince" title="So_Blue">
I had everything I needed
But now you're gone
And I'm so blue
You meant the world to me
But now you're gone
And I'm so blue
Even though the sun is shining
I spend my days, I spend my days crying over you
Oh, I spend my days crying over you
I feel just like the sky..... oh, so blue
Oh, baby don't you know, baby don't you know that
I spend my nights all alone, talking to myself
I am so blue
Everyday, the feeling gets stronger
And who's to say, just how much longer
I can....
Spend my nights, all alone, talking to myself and just crying over you
I guess I'll just spend my life............. SO BLUE
