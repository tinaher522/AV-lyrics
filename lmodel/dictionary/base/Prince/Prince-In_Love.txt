<song artist="Prince" title="In_Love">
Ever since I met you, baby, I've been wantin' to lay you down,
But it's so hard to get you, baby, when you never come around...
Every day that you keep it away, it only makes me want it more;
Ooh, baby, just say the word, and I'll be at your door...
What more do I have to say? I really wanna play in your river...
Fallin', fallin', fallin' in love...
I'm fallin', baby, deeper every day; (In love...)
Ooh, baby, now you're takin' me away... (In love...)
I'm fallin', baby, girl, what can I do?
I just can't be without you...
Ever since I met you, baby, there's been somethin' inside of me
That keeps me wantin' you, baby - won't you set me free?
Take off these chains, girl, and I'll take off yours;
There's no one in the world, baby, that I wanna love more...
What else do I have to say? I really wanna play in your river...
Fallin', fallin', fallin' in love...
I'm fallin', baby, deeper every day... (In love...)
Ooh, baby, now you're takin' me away... (In love...)
I'm fallin', baby, girl, what can I do?
I just can't be without you...
Oh, oh, yeah...
Oh, oh, yeah...
I'm fallin' in love!
I'm fallin', baby, deeper every day... (In love...)
Ooh, baby, now you're takin' me away... (In love...)
I'm fallin', baby, girl, what can I do?
I just can't be without you...
I'm fallin', I'm fallin', (In love...)
I'm drownin', baby, in my love for you... (In love...)
Oh, baby, now you're takin' me away;
I just don't, I don't know what to say...
(In love...)
(In love...)
Oh, baby girl, you're takin' me away...
Oh, baby, baby, oh, baby, baby...
(In love...)
(In love...)
