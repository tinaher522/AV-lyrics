<song artist="Prince" title="Way_Back_Home">
I never wanted a typical life
Scripted role, huh, trophy wife
All I ever wanted, to be left alone
See my beds made up at night
'Cause in my dreams I roam
Just trying to find, trying to find
My way back, back home
So many reasons why
There's so many reasons why
I don't belong here
But now that I am I
Without fear I am
Gonna conquer with no fear
Until I find my way back home
Until I find my way back home
Find my way back home
Most people in this world
Most people in this world
Are born dead
But I was born alive
I was born with this dream
With a dream outside my head
That I could find my way back home
My, my way, way back home
Is this the way?
Power to the ones
Power to the ones who could raise a child like me
The path was set
But if u look the truth will set us free
I've heard about those happy endings
But it's still a mystery
Lemme tell u about me
I'm happiest when I can see
My way back home
Can u see my way back home
Can u see, oh my way back, my way back home
