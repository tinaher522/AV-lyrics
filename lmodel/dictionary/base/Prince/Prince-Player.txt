<song artist="Prince" title="Player">
So there U are
About time U showed up
Yea, I know what U heard
But let me talk
Baby, take a look outside your window
And see your future standing there
I've been here 4 a while now, baby
Or maybe U weren't aware
I knew that U heard every single story
About all the friends that I've got
But baby, if U give me 7 years of your time
All the friends I would have not
CHORUS:
Player - If I had U girl, I wouldn't be one
Player - If U'd let me in the mix, we could have fun
Player - If life was a movie, U'd have the main part
Girl, U're number one with a bullet on my charts
Don't make me say I need U like a begger man
Why don't U let me come inside?
I'm the type of male that a girl like U is in need of
Sho' U right
I could take U sailing in a glass bottom boat
U could drink wine while I read poems that I wrote
I'm sick of fishing in the big sea, baby
I wanna check out the settling down
I wanna dock my boat in your fairway
In your kisses I wanna drown {x3}
CHORUS
If I had U girl, I wouldn't be one
Friends, whatever they told U, they lied
My life's an open book, I ain't got nothing 2 hide
I need U like a begger, yeah, I got no pride
Open your heart, let me come inside
CHORUS
Baby, take a look outside your window
And see your future standing there
I've been here 4 a while now, baby
Or maybe U wouldn't care
I knew that U heard every single story
About all the friends that I've got
But baby, if U give me 7 years of your time
All the friends I will have not
Player - If I had U girl, I wouldn't be one
Player - If U'd let me in the mix, we could have fun
Player - If life was a movie, U'd have the main part
Cuz girl, U're number one with a bullet on my charts
Player {x3}
So that's my day in court
