<song artist="Prince" title="The_One">
If u're lookin' 4 the man that will walk away from responsibility
I ain't the one {x3}
And if u're lookin' 4 the brotha that'll treat u like anything but a
Queen
I ain't the one
But if u're lookin' 4 a man that'll sweep u off your tired weary feet
Pay your bills, buy u pretty dresses
And take u anywhere u wanna eat
Make love 2 u every night of the week
Oh, don't think it over, girl
Look no further
I am the one
Oh yes I am
If u're lookin' 4 a man that'll make big money
And keep it all 2 himself
I ain't the one
No, no - not me
And if u're lookin' 4 a man that'll have 10 women
And confuse it all with his wealth
Listen here, I ain't that one
No, no no - wait a minute
If u're lookin' 4 a man who can share his dinero (his money)
Buy u half the town (half the town)
Treat every step u take (every step)
As if u're walkin', huh, on holy ground (holy ground)
Place u, place u above all others

When it comes, when it comes 2 the gettin' on down (down)
Look no further, ooh
Your man's around (he's around)
Oh yes he is
He's standing right here, right here (right here, right here)
Don't u look no further, girl
He's standing right here, right here
(I am the one) {x2}
If u're lookin' 4 a man that'll make u feel like time has just begun,
Ooh
A man that'll make u feel like u're the only thing that ever
Mattered
Underneath the sun, underneath the sun, ooh
If u're lookin' 4 somebody
Who will turn your bad day into one long night of fun
Look no further, baby
I'm¡­ I'm the one
Oh yes I am
I am the one
Don't u look no further, girl
Oh, I am the one
Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes, oh
My, my, my little mayte
I'm the one
