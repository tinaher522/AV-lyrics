<song artist="Prince" title="I'll_Do_Anything">
I'll do anything 2 have U like me
I'll do double 2 have your love
I'll move mountains 2 make U happy
Mountains, oh yes, because
What good is a me if it ain't got a U?
What good is dream if it don't come true?
I'll do any, anything
Anything I'll do, ooh
I'll fall off the Eiffel Tower if only 4 applause
I'll wrestle with a tiger and suffer every claw
I'll paint a beard on the Mona Lisa even though its my favorite jaw
I'll do anything, anything because
What good is a captain if he ain't got a crew?
What good is a room if it ain't got a view?
I'll do any, anything
Anything I'll do
Wait a minute
Wait a minute..
There's a good reason why I'd do anything, baby
And that reason is U
Check this out..
What good is a car if it ain't got no gas?
What good is a future if it ain't got no past?
What good is a one if it ain't got another one 2 make it 2?
What good is a me, baby, if it ain't got a U?
What good is a dream if it don't come true
And what if I live 4 your love?
Be justa strollin' through
I'll do any, anything
Anything 4 U, it's true
I'll do anything, baby
Anything 4 U
I'll do any, anything
Anything I'll do, ooh ooh
I'll do any, anything
Anything I'll do, ooh ooh
