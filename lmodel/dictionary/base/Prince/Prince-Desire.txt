<song artist="Prince" title="Desire">
So long have we known each other (So long have we known each other)
So little do we know (Little do we know)
Sometimes I feel like strangers (Sometimes I feel like strangers)
The real us we seldom do show (Seldom do show)
CHORUS:
Desire, it covers our faces
It happens in curious places
Your body, it covers my tower
Ecstasy is ours
I dream of a physical evening (Dream of a physical evening {x3})
I long 4 a night within U
U're saving your love 4 some soldier (Some soldier {x3})
Who'd much rather die than stay by your side
If U only knew
CHORUS
A ghost from your past
Prevents us from knowing the pleasures of love
What must I do 2 convince U
Isn't the expression on my complexion enough?
(Ecstasy)
Don't tell me we have conflicting emotions
It's written all over your face
Come my love, cover my tower
Ecstasy is ours
So long have we known each other (So long have we known each other)
So little do we know
Let me show U
CHORUS {x3}
