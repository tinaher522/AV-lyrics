<song artist="Prince" title="The_Marrying_Kind">
If you leave her now
Your never goin to see her again-never
Now shes gonna need a shoulder to cry on
Shes gonna need a friend
Shes gonna need a pillowcase
Something to put those tears on
And I've got some purple satin lacies
1 seond later than the second your gone
Shes gonna miss you at first
But then shes gonna buy me things
Thats when I'm gonna lay her
'Cross my piano stool and sing to her
Honey I tried to tell him 
That you were the marrying kind
A faithful one man woman
The best he would ever find
I guess he wasn't trying to hear that
So there aint nothing left to say
I tried to tell him if you run to me
I, I won't run away
If you leave her now
You'll never get another glimpse
I'm gonna lace her with enough ice to recap the poles
There might be another solar eclipse
Shes gonna find........
bath water hot enough to be touched(oh man,porkchop is hurtin)
I'm gonna put her on the same diet Missy went on
You know she eat too much
Tonight, she's gonna miss you at first
But then she'll get used to me
All of the tricks I would try
To make her take this ring and make love to me
Honey I tried to tell him 
That you were the marrying kind
A faithful one man woman
The best he would ever find
I guess he wasn't trying to hear that
So there aint nothing left to say
I tried to tell him if you run to me
I, I won't run away
Run away
Run away
Run away
Oh, oh
Don't run away
