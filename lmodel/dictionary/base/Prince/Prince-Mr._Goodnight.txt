MR. GOODNIGHT 
Mister, mister, 
Love U mister 
Come on 
Chorus: 
Call Mr Goodnight 
He'll make u feel alright (what? what?) 
Make U throw ur head back and holla 
So nice, so nice (that's right) 
Better not tell ur girlfriend (don't do it) 
U can try with all ur might (all ur might) 
Just can't keep a secret 
'Bout goodnight, goodnight 
Hey, baby, hey baby, hey, baby, sitting all alone in my courtyard 
Lookin' as if U have every right 
All over the world they call me Prince 
But U can call me Mr Goodnight 
Surely the dandies that escort u places 
Imparted a rumour or two 
About the parade of lovely faces 
That follow me ... surely they do? 
What say u 2 that, lips so inviting 
It's all I can do not 2 stare 
What say u 2 them, past, present and future 
That u don't care (I don't care) 
If so, u'll be the first, and I'll give u the keys 
2 the whip of ur dreams, alright? 
All over the world they call me Prince (yeah) 
But U can call me Mr Goodnight 
Chorus: 
Call Mr Goodnight 
He'll make u feel alright (alright) 
Make ya throw ur head back and holla (yeah) 
It's so nice, so nice 
Better not tell ur girlfriend 
U can try with all ur might (better not) 
Just can't keep a secret 
About goodnight, goodnight 
Now I don't wanna put to U 2 sleep with a bunch of chatter 
And a rap that really don't matter 
But now that u know who I am u need 2 make plans 
And all ur other pennies should scatter (scatter) 
A limousine about 2 pick U up 
And then took U 2 a private jet (2 fine) (yeah) 
And then U gonna meet a little Spanish man 
Who will offer U wine and Moet 

In an hour or 2, u'll be taken to a suite 
That will rock all ur wildest dreams 
And on the bed 3 dresses 2 choose 1, pick 1 
Then U get a call from me (ring) 
Tell me which dress U chose 
So I can put on, put on my matching suit 
All the real guys hold ur hands up 
U know how Mr Goodnight do it 
Chorus: 
Call Mr Goodnight (call him) 
He'll make u feel alright (alright) 
Make ya throw ur head back and holla (come on) 
It's so nice, so nice (think I won't?) 
Better not tell ur girlfriend (don't do it) 
U can try with all ur might (3121) 
Just can't keep a secret 
About goodnight, goodnight (goodnight) 
I love U baby 
I don't want nobody else 
Call Mr Goodnight (U can call him) (any time at all) 
Call Mr Goodnight (yeah, yeah, yeah) (I love U mister) 
MP3: Mike Philly in the band like jams at midnight 
Before the main attraction U'll see 
Slow it down somewhere here on earth 
Just 2 check how ur reaction be 
And if ur heartbeat goes up a notch or 2 
There ain't no telling what I might do 
I got a mind full of good intentions 
And a mouth full of raisenets (better not tell U) 
We can watch 'Chocolat' on the big screen 
Before we convene in the pool (yeah) 
The waterfall'll wash ur cares away 
Already I love U, I do 
Chorus: 
Call Mr Goodnight 
Make u feel alright (mister, mister) 
Make ya throw ur head back and holla 
It's so nice, so nice (so nice) 
Better not tell ur girlfriend 
U can try with all ur might (Mr Midnight) 
Just can't keep a secret 
About goodnight, goodnight 
The energy in this field's been known to flicker lights, aye 
A slip o' me with no rest, acapella moans and a break of sighs (goodnight) (call, call) 
Undeterred nevertheless a masterpiece on butterscotch thighs (call, call) 
Turn off the lights, turn off the lights 
It's time for Mr Goodnight
