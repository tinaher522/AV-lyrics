<song artist="Prince" title="When_2_R_In_Love">
So fierce U look 2night
The brightest star pales 2 your sex
Before we do anything, let me just talk 2 U
When 2 are in love
They'll whisper secrets only they 2 can hear
When 2 are in love
When 2 are in love (Love)
Their stomachs will pound every time the other comes near
When 2 are in love
When 2 are in love (Love)
Falling leaves will appear 2 them like slow motion rain
Slow motion, slow motion
When 2 are in love
The speed of their hips can be faster than a runaway train
(Drip-drop, drip-drop - water, water, water)
Come bathe with me – let's drown each other in each other's emotions
Bathe with me – let's cover each other with perfume and lotion
Bathe with me – ooh, let me touch your body till your river's an ocean
Bathe with me – let's kiss with one synonymous notion
Nothing's forbidden and nothing's taboo (Nothing's taboo)
When the 2 are in love (L.O.V.E. - L.O.V.)
Can U hear me?
When 2 are in love (When 2 are in love)
Their bodies shiver at the mere contemplation of penetration
(Let alone the act) Let alone the actual act (Act)
When 2 are in love
The thought of his tongue in the V of her love
In his mind (this thought) - it leads the pack (Pack)
Come bathe with me – let's drown each other in each other's emotions
Bathe with me – let's cover each other with perfume and lotion
Bathe with me – ooh, let me touch your body till your river's an ocean
Bathe with me – let's kiss with one synonymous notion
That nothing's forbidden and nothing's taboo (Nothing's taboo)
When the 2 are in love (Love)
In love
Can U hear me?
Hold me
Yeah, just like that
Don't move
