<song artist="Prince" title="Rock_And_Roll_Love_Affair">
Ye ye ye yeah
She believes in fairy tale and princes
He believes the voices coming from his stereo.
He believed in rock 'n roll.
She left the past and those lily white fences
And headed out to Hollywood in
Search of her soul
But she had to pay the toe, yes she did.
They were bound to find each other
He need proof, she needed a brother
That's when stars collide
When the space for what you want
And your heart is open wide.
He gave up women for the stripes of the road,
Learnd the meaning of grace
That's when his couple of float.
And she said: Hello!
He said: my faith may seem I'm willing
But you know that I'm able
It doesn't ruled my life to sit at your table.
She says: it's tight, but I think I can fix your head.
This kind of love don't come from a prayer
It Ain't talking rebound, born of despair.
Yellow sun rising on their bodies in bed
Two people in love, with nothing but the road ahead.
Oh yeah, oh oh.
Alright!
Oh oh oh ooh ooh.
Let's go!
She believes in fairy tales and princes
He believed in jazz with rhythm and blues
And this thing called soul
He believed in rock 'n roll.
She wanted to seal her name appeared on the big screen
He just wanted to hear a scream as name.
Can you scream my name?
Do you know what I mean?!
This kind of love don't come from a prayer
It Ain't talking rebound, born of despair.
Yellow sun rising on their bodies in bed
Two people in love, with nothing but the road ahead.
Rock rock love affair
Rock rock love affair
Rock rock love affair
