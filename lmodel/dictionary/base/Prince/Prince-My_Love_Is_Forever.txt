<song artist="Prince" title="My_Love_Is_Forever">
You're always on my mind,
Day and night, baby, all the time... (All the time...)
You mean so much to me;
A love like ours just had to be...
You're the wind and the rain;
You've got a river that takes away my pain...
You're the sky that's, oh, so blue;
You're everything, girl - don't you know I need you? (Need you...)
You are the only thing that keeps me goin';
You are the only thing that keeps my love alive...
You are the only thing that I'll ever need;
You don't have to worry - you see, my love is forever...
Oh, sugar, I don't have to dream,
'Cause you give me what I want - ah... - Girl, you know what I mean...
Forever, 'til my life is through, 
I, I will love you... (Love you...)
Oh, oh... What does it take to make you see
That you are the only one for me?
I'll never, never stop loving you, never, never stop wanting you,
Never, never get enough of you - love is forever...
You are the only thing that keeps me goin';
You are the only thing, keeps my love alive...
You are the only thing that I'll ever need;
You don't have to worry - my love is forever...
Ah, woo...
Ooh-hoo, ah, yeah, yeah...
Ever and ever and ever and ever and yeah! Yeah!
