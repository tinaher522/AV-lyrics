<song artist="Prince" title="Horny_Pony">
Ahhh, yes.
New dance commercial take 1
Ahhh, yes.
There ya go, there ya go
Horny people, gather here
Horny people, gather here
Horny people, gather here, 
we have somethin' to put in all your ears
We got a new dance, for the next 8 years
I'm talking about the dance that every parent fears
the most, it's the sex dance, it's the new dance,
and it's rockin' from coast-2-coast...
I'm talkin' about, I'm talkin' about, 
I'm talkin' about the Horny Pony, y'all
Come on. There ya go, there ya go. Horny Pony
{Girl-friend, look at this dance Prince is doin' now. Is he weird or what?}
sing. (horny pony... ow ow ow)
{Now that's too freaky!}
In the years of the war, we don't want 2 know
you're buckin' that body like U really go
for the hip stuff,
H and to the I and to the P
it ain't enough just 2 do some exstacy.
U want it in your hip, U want it in your thigh
It's the dance that conservatives really most despise
'cuz it's the sex dance, it's the new dance,
and it's rockin' every horny woman, every man
it's the Horny Pony, y'all
(horny pony... ow ow ow) There ya go.
Turn around.
Chicken grease in the house.
{Chicken grease? I don't know! That's it... I gotta run.}
And U can run all the way 2 Barcelona,
but U can't hide, the Horny Pony get ya gonna.
Don't look at me y'all, I just wrote it,
put on a record, wrapped it up, and then I sold it.
Horny people gather here,
Horny people gather here, for the next 8 years,
we got a new dance - it's the Horny Pony.
{Yeah, the music's jammin', but it's about these words!}

{So how am I supposed to do this dance?}
How do you do that dance!?!
{I can't do that... I'm a lady.} Sister please!
{I can't do that!}
Listen to me while I show U how 2 do it.
Just like a virgin, U got 2 ease into it.
Movin' your legs from left to right,
your arms up high like an eagle in flight.
Keep your hands shakin' like a leaf on a tree.
Jack-be-nimble - whew - you're doin' it, see!
The Horny Pony, y'all. There ya go, there ya go.
It's the Horny Pony.
{Can you believe this? Oh my gawd, this guy...
oh, he's just... he's just so weird. Oh my goodness.
would you look at this? I just... I just cannot believe.
Girl, uh-uh... nope!}
(horny pony... ow ow ow)
Did you come here alone?
{Uhh - yeah. Why?}
Well guess who you're goin' home with?
{huh?}
(a laugh)
{ugh! that's nasty!}
Yeah.
(There ya go, there ya go.)
The Horny Pony.
(There ya go, there ya go.)
(horny pony... ow ow ow)
