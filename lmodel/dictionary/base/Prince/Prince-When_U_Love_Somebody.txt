<song artist="Prince" title="When_U_Love_Somebody">
I was the one sleepin' all alone
When U were at the party 
I was the one waitin' by the phone
When U were with somebody
Now here U come again 
With your heart in your hands
Confessin' all of your sins
Same tired line that I've heard a dozen times
Still I've got 2 give in
CHORUS:
Cuz when U love somebody
Every now and then it might rain
When U love somebody
With every sun shower there's pain
Whenever something's lost 
Something's gained 
When U love somebody
When U love someone
U were the one lookin' 4 some action 
I was just lookin' 4 U 
"Who needs love when U got protection"
Quote, unquote your point of view
All my partners say that I need 2 dismiss U
Until they see U smile (such a pretty smile) 
All them fools are buggin'
Cuz they just want your lovin' 
In the backseat 4 a little wile
but I don't care
CHORUS  
Round and round 
don't stop the poundz
Cuz a brutha's gettin' 
Down here lately! 
Freedom agress with us all U C 
In a state of mind
that's weightless...
C on the quantum tip I 
Flipped on the notion of when 
The Adam split we got Eve 
Duality's now a groupie
with a backstage pass
And they ain't gonna leave 
'till they get some...
From grace we fall 
Referring 2 the objects on the wall 
My hat , my coat, my ballz R
round and round 
don't stop the poundz 
'Cuz a brutha's gettin' down here lately!
