<song artist="Prince" title="S.S.T.">
Who will b a guest in ur tent?
Certainly not the ones who don't wanna repent
And keep giving guns 2 the poorest of our nation's sons
Who is gonna call u by name?
With no confusion, trinity or preacher's vain?
Who says that everytime
And opens up the eyes of the blind
Who will b the 1 in his bed?
Certainly not the 1's who put thorns on his head
And wish him dead while they took his daily bread
Which 1 is of value 2 u?
The 1 depleting the oil supply
Or the One that renews it
And keeps the peace
Like the groove in Sade's Sweetest Taboo
Give it to me, give it to me, the sweetest
Give it to me, give it to me
Give it to me, give it to me, the sweetest
Who will b a guest in ur tent?
R u gonna b happy with how ur life has been spent?
Did u have open arms 4 each and everybody you met?
Or did U let them die in the rain?
Endless war, poverty or hurricane
Then it's time 4 another groove
Like Sade's Sweetest Taboo
Give it to me, give it to me, the sweetest
Give it to me, give it to me
Give it to me, give it to me, the sweetest
Give it to me, give it to me, the sweetest
Give it to me, give it to me
Give it to me, give it to me, the sweetest
