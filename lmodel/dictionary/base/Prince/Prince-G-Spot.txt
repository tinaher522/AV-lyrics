<song artist="Prince" title="G-Spot">
"F" is 4 frustration
I'm looking 4 what isn't really there
"I" is instigation
I'm listening 2 the voice beneath my hair
"N" is 4 the naked body
And 4 what my naked eye can see
CHORUS:
G-spot, G-spot
Where, oh where can U be?
"A" is 4 America
And 4 the things U read in magazines
"L" is 4 location
I am a clock, the time is 9:15
"L" is 4 the lust we share
We want 2 know that infamous pleasure
CHORUS
"Y" is 4 my yearning
I'm burning into mystery
CHORUS
G-spot {x3}
Ooh yeah
Yeah, yeah
Oh, oh Lord
