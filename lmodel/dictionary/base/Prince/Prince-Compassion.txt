<song artist="Prince" title="Compassion">
Get it on 
Right now
A zero point approches
And the field around u drops
Thoughts b come reality
And iif feels like tiime has stopped
When all thats on the radio
Iis electromagnetiic pop
Steady, ur teeth r gnashin
Compassion 
Get it on 
Compassion
Riight now
Love 4 the greater number
Freezes over and cools
And every1 around u acts liike a bloody fool
No sancity 2 the left of u 
No righteousness 2 the right
The only thiing thats left iis fashion
Compassion 
Get it on 
Compassion
Whatever skin ur in
We all need 2 b friiends
All happy again
So much better than nothing
Everybody can win 
Wiith a little faith in man 
Begining of an end
Start up a brand new something
When ego, fear, and judgement
B come the rule of law
Watch the polar ice caps
Heat up, melt down, and thaw
When t he greedy 1 4gets
That hes the reason 4 iit all
The only gold thats so worth stashing
Compassion 
Get it on 
Compassion
Riight on right on
Iin the high seated lawless no love can b found
Nature will rise against nature and get down
Whatever skin ur iin 
We all need 2 b friends
All happy again 
Its so much better that nothing
Everybody can win
With a little faith iin man
Beginning of an end
Start up a brand new something
If u got compassion
Lets get back in fasion
The new internatiional anthem
Whatever skin ur in ur in 
We all need 2 b friends
All happy again
Iits so much better than nothing
Everybody can win
Wiith a little faith in man
Beginning of an end
And start up a brand new something
Whatever skin ur in
( whatever skin ur in)
We all need 2 b friends
( black and white and yellow we can b friends)
All happy again
Iits so much better than nothing
Everybody can ein 
With a little faith in  man
Beginning of an end
And start up a brand new something
