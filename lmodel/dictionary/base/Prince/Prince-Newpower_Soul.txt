<song artist="Prince" title="Newpower_Soul">
2 the darkness - let there be light
2 the soundman - turn up my voice real tight
2 the n.p.g. - if u in this mother, scream
Show me how u all get down - 1 2 3, come on
Get freaky, let the head bob {x2}
We should all come 2gether 2 the newpower soul
Get freaky, let the head bob {x2} (come on, come on)
It'll make u feel much better - come on, baby, let's go!
Every while in a great once there comes 2 town a show
That lives up 2 all your funkspectation no matter how high or low
A reason 2 get your freak on in a way u never freaked before
Newpower soul lay claim 2 the booty - come on, let's go
(lemme see u get down)
Let the head bob
Get freaky, let the head bob (come on, come on)
We should all come 2gether 2 the newpower soul
(lemme see u get down)
Let the head bob
Get freaky, let the head bob {x2} (come on, come on)
It'll make u feel much better - come on, baby, let's go!
Every while in a day twice funky matters in our ear
As long as we keep our love strong, we'll never shed no tears
The brothas be threatenin' 2 jump off buildings, newpower's what
They fear
Love 4 one another risin', newpower soul is here
(lemme see u get down)
Let the head bob
Get freaky, let the head bob (come on)
We should all come 2gether 2 the newpower soul (come

Let the head bob
Get freaky, let the head bob (come on, come on)
It'll make u feel much better (feel better) - come on, baby, let's go!
Newpower soul
(we should all) {repeat sample}
Gemini rising on the 7th day
Makin' mad sex, until u're in my arms, ok? 
Cuz when u love somebody like that, it's cool
U gots no need 4 the shoo-bed-ooh-bed-ooh
The good life, yeah, we'll be livin'
Pushin' up on every freak this side of heaven
Come on, come on, shake it, come on
U know I be's the one with the funky music, hon'
And I'm layin' phat claims 2 the booty
