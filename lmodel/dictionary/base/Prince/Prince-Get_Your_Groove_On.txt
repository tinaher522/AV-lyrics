<song artist="Prince" title="Get_Your_Groove_On">
Get your groove on
I got some money 'cause I just got paid
It's time 2 get my groove on
Been workin? hard, now it's time 2 play
I gots 2 get my groove on
Can't wait 2 see your face again
U keep me happy, yeah, u're my best friend
In the park around a half past 9
Meet me, we'll have a real good time
Chorus:
Come on, everybody get your groove on
Come on, we gonna party all night long
Get your groove on
I got some honey and some peppermint tea
That's all I need 2 get my drink on
Don't want this night 2 end if u're with me
We gonna party all night long
Bring the player, I'll bring the cds
But don't u put nothing slow on
That new d?angelo, some n.p.g.
And we'll make a bet 2 see who keep their clothes on
Chorus
I'm usually workin? both night and day
No time 4 fun
But 2night I'm gonna get my groove on
I'm sayin? 'til I see the sun
Till I see the sun, ooh, I wanna play
Come on!
Speak

Alrighty
Around a half past 9?
