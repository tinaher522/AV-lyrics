<song artist="Prince" title="Cybersingle">
CHORUS:
I am the cybersingle, that is me
Come and get my download
2 be free or not 2 be free,
That is the question, see?
All the beautiful ones are with me
See, it's lovely 
As the media tightens (What?) its grip on U (U know)
And the beast continues (What?) 2 split in 2 (Listen y'all)
Superman steps in the phone booth (Word) one more time (Come on, come on)
2 drop another cybersingle (Drop it) life-saving rhyme (It's lovely) 
Lookin' for a sound that'll make U organize
Dead Prez. and Rage conspire 2 open up your eyes (Can U see?)
What good is a mind of a man if it's run by another? (Nothing)
Take back your conscienceness, my sisters and brothers! 
CHORUS 
(Yeah yeah)
(That is me)
(Download)
(Free)

It's lovely
Can't leave the keys in my brand-new car
'cause U don't know it's wrong 2 steal
The devil got U thinkin' he's invisible
But how he make U act is real
Stupid
Talk a beat
Turn around, long hand, come on
Cybersingle
Television got your mind but U got 2 get free
Cybersingle
Purple Haze
Jesus saves 
Cybersingle
Sister and brothers have love 4 one another! {x2}
Cyber, cyber {x2}
