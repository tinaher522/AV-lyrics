Club Mix {x2}
Gett off {repeat in Background}
How can I put this in a way so as not 2 offend or unnerve?
But there's a rumor goin' all around that you ain't been gettin' served
They say that you ain't "you know what" in, baby, who knows how long
It's hard for me to say what's right when all I wanna do is wrong
CHORUS:
Gett off - 23 positions in a one night stand
Gett off - I'll only call you after if you say I can
Gett off - Let a woman be a woman and a man be a man
Gett off - If you want to, baby, here I am
(Here I am)
I clocked the jizz from a friend of yours named Vanessa Bet (Bet)
She said you told her a fantasy that got her all wet (Wet)
Something about a little box with a mirror and a tongue inside (Yeah)
What she told me then got me so hot, I knew that we could slide (Ooh)
CHORUS
(Come on)
Gett off {x2}
1 2 3
Naw, little cutie, I ain't drinkin'
But scope this, I was just thinkin'
You + me, what a ride
If you was thinkin' the same, we could continue outside
Lay your pretty body against the parkin' meter
Strip your dress down like I was strippin' a Peter Paul's Almond Joy
Lemme show you, baby, I'm a talented boy
(Oh yeah)
Club mix
Everybody grab a body
Pump it like you want somebody
Gett off
Everything about you just screams of a real sexy affair (Ooh yeah)
The nasty way you walk, the way you flip your hair (you know it, poppa)
Babygirl, I'm all veins when I'm scopin' that body rare (Oh, stop it)
Betcha I'ma pack a lunch and spend a while there, ohh
CHORUS
(Can we?)
I'm gonna kiss in you front of everybody, I don't care
That's right, I pulled your dress up
Shit, you ain't got no underwear on
I shoulda known, I shoulda known
Butterscotch curly hair, I wish you had some drawers on now
Stone freak to the bone
I can't believe it, we're going home
Everybody grab a body, pump it like you want somebody {x2}
So here we, so here we
So here we are, here we are in my paisley crib
What cha want to eat? (Ribs!)
Naw Toy, I don't serve ribs
you better be happy that dress is still on
I heard the rip when you sat down
Honey, them hips is gone
But that's alright, I clock 'em that way
Remind me of somethin' James used 2 say
"I like 'em fat, I like 'em proud
You got to have a mother for me"
Now move your big ass 'round this way
So I can work on that zipper, baby
Tonight you're a star and I'm the Big Dipper
Na, na, na, na {x2}
Everybody grab a body, pump it like you want somebody (Gett off) {x2}
Ooh, I think I like it with the dress half on
I'll zip it far enough 2 see the crack'o'dawn
Don't worry about the bust, I'm gonna lock up every door
Then we can do it in the kitchen on the floor
Or in the bathroom standing on the tub and holding on the rod
U're in the closet underneath the clothes and...oh my God!
In the bedroom on the dresser with your feet on the drawers
In the pantry on the shelf, I guarantee you won't be bored
The pool table, yeah, move the sticks
And put the 8-ball where it's sure to stick
Dudley do no wrong tonight if Nell just let him kick it
(Kick it) {x3}
How can I put this in a way so as not to offend or unnerve?
But there's a rumor goin' all around that you ain't been gettin' served
They say that you ain't "You know what" in, baby, who knows how long
It's hard for me to say what's right when all I wanna do is wrong
CHORUS
(Come on)
(Gett off) {repeat till end}
