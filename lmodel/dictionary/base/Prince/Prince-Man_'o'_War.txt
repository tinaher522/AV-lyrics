<song artist="Prince" title="Man_'o'_War">
Why u screaming? 
U know I'm not a man of war
Break the gold chain that I gave u
Throw it down on the floor
Instead of this 7 page letter
I wish I had piece of mind
My friends tell me: ¡±u should go get her¡±
But loving u, loving u, loving u
Is a waste of time
Oh yes it is, a waste of time - ooh
I need 2 get out of this city
I need 2 get u out of my head
I need 2 get away from the words that u said 2 me
Why u screaming? (ooh)
U know I'm not a man of war
How could u think that i
Could put something inside of someone
That I put inside u, inside u? 
Even if I tried 2 (tried 2), tried 2 (tried 2)
I couldn't cuz I still smell like the last time that we ...
Loving u, loving u, loving u
Is a waste of time (a waste of time)
Oh, yes it is
Loving u - a waste of time (ooh-oh)
I need 2 feel wanted again
I need 2 feel love is alive, yeah
I need 2 hear u say
That u ain't looking 4 another reason 2 make me cry
Why u screaming? (ooh)
U know I'm not a man of war
I've been trying 2 make u happy, baby
Ever since we were sophomores
(but loving u, loving u, loving u)
Is a waste of time, oh yes it is
Oh, is a waste of time, waste of time, waste of time...
If there's no future
Then there is no past
And all we've got is right now
Let's make it last
Make it last, make it last (ooh)
Why u screaming? 
U know I'm not a man of war
Break the gold chain (break the gold chain that I gave u)
Throw it down on the floor - oh baby
Instead of this 7 page letter
I wish I had piece of mind
(my friends tell me: ¡±u should go get her¡±)
Tell me: ¡±u should go get her¡±
(but loving u) loving u, loving u, loving u
Is a waste of time (a waste of time)
Oh, a waste of time - oh yeah
I need 2 get out of this city
I need 2 get u out of my head
I need 2...
I need 2 get away from the words that u said 2 me
I need 2... [...]
I need 2 feel wanted again
Oh, I need 2 hear no sin
Hear me...
(but loving u, loving u, loving u)
Why u screaming? 
U know I'm not a man of war
Break the gold chain that I gave u
Throw it down on the floor - oh baby
Instead of this 7 page letter
I wish I had piece of mind
My friends tell me: ¡±u should go get her¡±
But loving u, loving u, loving u
Is a waste of time
U know I'm not a man of war
