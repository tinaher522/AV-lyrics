<song artist="Prince" title="Hide_The_Bone">
(hide the bone) {repeat in song}
(ah yeah, ah yeah) {repeat sample in song}
Hide the bone
(oh yeah) {repeat sample in song}
I can't hold it any longer
It's gettin' harder every day
The need 4 u is getting stronger
Than my need 2 play
Chorus:
Playin' hard 2 get is gettin' hard 2 play
How can I be cool fallin' every day? 
Playin' hard 2 get is gettin' hard 2 play
How can I resist? love has got me sayin', baby
"give it up - bang, bang - before it be gone!"
Hide the bone
Oh, when u whisper that u want me
Press your body close 2 mine
I feel the fire burnin' and I just wanna surrender
I wanna surrender every time, hey!
Chorus
Hide the bone
Hey baby
(bone) {x2}
U're goin' 2 ruin my reputation
I'm used 2 makin' all the rules
But I can't control this situation (I can't control it)
When it comes 2 me and u
U're breakin' down my resistance
I won't ever be the same, oh no (oh no)
U kiss away all my defenses
This time the hunter is captured by the game (bone)
Chorus
Ah yeah, hey
(bone)
Whatever u do - keep it movin'
Whatever u do - don't stop {repeat phrase x4}
Don't stop the groove {x8}
(let's hide the bone)
Bone {x9} (let's hide the bone)
Whatcha stoppin' 4, nigga? 
I didn't tell u 2 stop
(let's hide the bone)
