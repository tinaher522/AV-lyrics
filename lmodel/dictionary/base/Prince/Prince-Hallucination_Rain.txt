<song artist="Prince" title="Hallucination_Rain">
Say baby, the soup tastes kinda funny
I don't know
My skin's crawling
It feels strange
Is this the same soup as usual?
Mmm, I don't know
It feels strange
CHORUS:
Hallucination rain
Hallucination rain
Find another vein
Hallucination rain
I think this is gonna be the big 1
This 1's gonna last 5 minutes or more
This is gonna be the real 1
1 that's gonna make U look 4 the key 2 the door That leads 2 the alley where we
did the last 1 This is gonna be fun {x4}
CHORUS
This is gonna be the good 1
The 1 that makes all the books
This is gonna be the only chance we get 2 redeem ourselves I'll confess if U do,
but here's the hook Are U ready? {x5}
Pain, pain
Sweet laceration
Pain, pain
Hallucination rain
Pain, pain
Sweet laceration
Pain, pain
Hallucination rain
Hallucination rain {x4}
