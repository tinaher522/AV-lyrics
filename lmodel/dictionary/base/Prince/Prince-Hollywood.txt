<song artist="Prince" title="Hollywood">
Performed by george clinton
Composed by tracey lewis and dallas austin
San diego freeway northbound around
Culver city westwood into beverly hills
U've gone hollywood
I'm gonna look, I won't touch
Oh it's live but then, thanks very much
Where the happening be at 2 night it's hollywood
As I stepped out on my front porch
4 miles around I see
Hollywood the way she once was
Hollywood the way she be
As I step back upon my back terrace
Amongst the pretty leaves on my lemon tree
San fernando valley way below
I'm struttin' 2 the east side of hollywood
I'm stompin' on the west side of hollywood
I'm steppin' 2 the north side of hollywood
I'm struttin' 2 the south side of hollywood
Chorus:
Holly wants 2 go 2 california (livin' in hollywood)
Holly would if holly could (livin' in hollywood)
Holly she belongs in california (livin' in hollywood)
Holly would if holly could (livin' in hollywood)
Say u want 2 be in the moviestars
Bourgeois, intercontinental never know where u are
U've gone hollywood
I was caught out on the beat
Without even a single piece of id
And the man said 2 me it's who u know in hollywood
Hollywood
I'm funkin' on the north side of hollywood

I'm kickin' on the east side of hollywood
I'm steppin' 2 the west side of hollywood
Chorus
Holly wants 2 go
San diego freeway northbound around
Culver city westwood into beverly hills
U've gone hollywood
I'm gonna look, I won't touch
Oh it's live but then, thanks very much
Where the happening be at 2 night it's hollywood
Holly wants 2 go 2 california (california) (livin' in hollywood)
Holly would if holly could (livin' in hollywood)
Holly needs 2 be in california (livin' in hollywood)
And she wants 2 shine (livin' in hollywood)
Like the hollywood sign (livin' in hollywood)
Oh, sure 7 fine (california) (livin' in hollywood)
Holly's going 2 california (livin' in hollywood)
Holly would, holly would if holly could (livin' in hollywood)
Holly
Holly
I'm on back upon my back terrace
Amongst the pretty leaves on my lemon tree
Holly looks good 2 me
(livin' in hollywood)
(livin' in hollywood)
Oh, existin' ha!
(livin' in hollywood)
Oh, in hollywood
(livin' in hollywood)
Holly would if holly could
(livin' in hollywood) {repeat to fade}
