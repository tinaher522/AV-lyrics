<song artist="Prince" title="17_Days">
Called u yesterday
U didn't answer your phone
The main drag is knowing that
U probably weren't alone
So here I sit in my lonely room
Lookin' 4 my sunshine
But all I've got is two cigarettes
And this broken heart of mine
So let the rain come down
Let the rain come down
Let the rain come down, down
Let the rain come down
Let the rain come down
Let the rain come down, down
You've been gone 17 days
17 long nights
The main drag is knowing that
You're holding someone else tight
I wanna to call u everyday
And beg u 2 be near me
But I know your head is underwater
I doubt that u could hear me
So let the rain come down
Let the rain come down
Let the rain come down, down
Let the rain come down
Let the rain come down
Let the rain come down, down
Ha, ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
17 Days
Ha, ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
17 Days
Called u yesterday
U didn't answer your phone
If you're the one who's always lonely
Then I'm the one who's always alone
So here I sit in my lonely room
Lookin' 4 my sunshine
All I've got is 2 cigarettes
And this broken heart of mine
Let the rain come down
Let the rain come down
Let the rain come down, down
Let the rain come down
Let the rain come down
Let the rain come down, down
Let the rain come down
Let the rain come down
Let the rain come down, down
Why don't you answer your phone?
Let the rain come down
Let the rain come down
Let the rain come down, down
17 Days
Let the rain come down
Let the rain come down
Let the rain come down, down
17 Days
