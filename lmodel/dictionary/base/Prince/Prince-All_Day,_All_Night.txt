<song artist="Prince" title="All_Day,_All_Night">
Oh, what a beautiful morning 
Oh, what a beautiful ass 
Darling, this is my final plea 4 love 
Take me now or witness the slow and horrible death of your white
fox 
My time is running out 
I can wait no longer 
I watch as U make love 2 others 
Disgusting as it seems, it intoxicates me 
U might say that I'm amused 2 the point 
Where my blood increases, my heartbeat accelerates 
And my mouth waters uncontrollably 
4 I know that no woman will ever love U like your white fox 
No woman will ever kiss U in this lifetime or the next 
The way U and I kiss 2night 
Take me now as I am 
4 I am becoming confused 2 what I stand 4 and desire 
Tell me, darling, who I am, who I am, what I am, what am I? 
What am I? 
Oh, are these my lips 
Or are they petals from some crazy flower? 
Oh, are these my hips? 
If they are, then they're some kind of powerful 
CHORUS: 
All day, all night 
U can be my baby, I'll make U feel alright 
All day, all night 
U can be my baby, I'll make U feel alright 
Oh, is this your mouth? 
Am I swirling in some wet tornado? 
Oh, U make me wanna shout 
When I'm in your arms, I feel like Play-Doh 
CHORUS 
Wait a minute 
Oh, is this your house? 
Am I in an ocean of desire? 
Oh, U make me wanna shout 
When I'm in your love, I feel on fire (Ooh) 
All day, all night 
U can be my baby, make U feel alright 
All day, all night 
U can be my baby, I'll make U feel alright 
Shockalaka 
All day, all night 
U can be my baby, make U feel alright {repeat phrase 4 times} 
Yeah, yeah, yeah 
What I {confused ad-libbing} 
Am what am I what 
Am I who 
Am I who, darling, me 2 
Desire 4 and I want 2 be with U 
(Start, don't stop, make love every night and all day) {repeat
in BG} 
Becoming ... 2night I kiss ... I love U 
Woah .... darling ... night time 
U kissed ... I wanna know 
(Start, don't stop, make love every night and all day) {x3} 
Hey, what's happenin' y'all? 
This is a groove up in here 
U can be my baby, make U feel alright 
All day (all day), all night (all night) 
U can be my baby, make U feel alright 
All day (all day), all night (all night) 
U can be my baby, make U feel alright 
What am I? (All day) What am I? (All night) 
U can be my baby, make U feel alright
