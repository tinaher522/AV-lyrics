<song artist="Prince" title="Act_Of_God">
Dirty, fat banker sold a house today
Sold at auction, wants the family out the way
Kicked them on the street 'cause they couldn't pay the tax
Call it an act of God
I get a million dollars for people to hear me sing
Gotta give the banker half of everything
Did the founding fathers holler about the same thing?
Call it an act of God
But I got news for you, freedom ain't free
They lock you in a cell if you try to be
But the ones who say no make history
Call it an act of God
Tax dollars build a plane, drop a bomb
Supposedly to keep us all safe from Saddam
Bringin' bad news to another woman
Call it an act of God
I got news for you, freedom ain't free
They lock you in a cell if you try to be
The ones who say no make history
Call it an act of God
Funny how nobody's holy books are the same
Everybody's god got a different name
The day that it's over is the end of the game
And they call it an act of God
It'll be all over when the people are free
Free to be who and what they wanna be
Wherever we go is up to you and me
Call it an act of God
We so tired, so we threw a fit
There never was no hell or boogie man-eater
If you see, he's in your mirror
Call it an act of God
Call it what you want except an act of God
Call it what you want except an act of God
Call it what you want except an act of God
Call it an act of God, oh lord
Call it what you want except an act of God
Call it what you want except an act of God
Call it what you want except an act of God
Call it what you want except an act of God
Call it what you want except an act of God
