<song artist="Prince" title="Illusion,_Coma,_Pimp_&_Circumstance">
She knew which fork 2 use 
But she couldn't dance 
So he hipped her 2 the funk 
In exchange 4 the finance 
Who's pimpin who
When nobody gets a second chance 
This is the story of illusion 
Coma, pimp and circumstance 
She was older 
But rich beyond compare
She'd drop a thousand dollars at the salon
Just to get her hair did
He was good at compliments 
Better in the bunk
She laced him with a crib in Paris
He hipped her 2 the funk
Way 2 fine he was 4 her
A dirty dog in expensive fur
As long as she's providing chips and whips
We can do this funky thang, uh huh
As long as she was playing host
He figured he would make the most
Of those hips and lips he hooked her up
Rocked her coast to coast funky thang
She was so ugly 
But rich beyond compare
Dropped a couple hundred thousand dDollars on a silver whip
Just 2 match the color of her hair
She said, "I got plenty of what U need
Put the spoon down honey
Come on let mama feed ya."
She knew which fork 2 use 
But she couldn't dance 
So he hipped her 2 the funk 
In exchange 4 the finance 
Who's pimpin who
When nobody gets a second chance 
This is the story of illusion 
Coma, pimp and circumstance
Where was I, oh yeah 
A gentleman he was 
He never spoke about her nose 
So prominent because
In the dark it glowed
If she was only tan instead of so
Lily white, her name was Doris 
But he called her Flo 
As in 'rescent 
that ain't right 
Florescent every night 
A situation bound to fail 
As sure as Doris' skin was pale 
Money might talk 
But what does it say
"You better get busy if ya wanna get paid."
"Boy I used to be fine back in the day."
She knew which fork 2 use 
But she couldn't dance 
So he hipped her 2 the funk 
In exchange 4 the finance 
Who's pimpin who
When nobody gets a second chance 
This is the story of illusion 
Coma, pimp and circumstance
Now dance 
Dance 
He spent her money oh so well
Takin' baths in cold cristal
He took a trip 2 burn an old flame in 'Frisco like Wow!
When Doris caught him in her arms
She shrugged her shoulders and said,"No harm...
Just put your name on this pre-nup and we can all hit the disco!"
She knew which fork 2 use 
But she couldn't dance 
So he hipped her 2 the funk 
In exchange 4 the finance 
Who's pimpin who
When nobody gets a second chance 
This is the story of illusion 
Coma, pimp and circumstance
She knew which fork 2 use 
But she couldn't dance 
So he hipped her 2 the funk 
In exchange 4 the finance 
Who's pimpin who
When nobody gets a second chance 
This is the story of illusion 
Coma, pimp and circumstance
Dance
Dance
Dance
Dance
