<song artist="Prince" title="Lolita">
Ow! Ow!
Stop it baby!
U're a VIP, at least 2 me
Come here and show me some ID
I know U're fine from head 2 pumps
If U were mine we'd bump, bump, bump
U're much 2 young 2 peep my stash
U're tryin' 2 write checks your body can't cash
U can't hang with this, girl, look out
Lolita, U're sweeter
But U'll never make a cheater outta me
Watch out now!
Cool 2gether yes, I must admit
Long time ago we'd be the sh... uh-oh!
Like Frank and Ava, we'd paint the town
Just on the floor, gettin' way down
Dom Perignon and caviar
The finest clothes and fancy cars
Oh, U know, one of them '56 pink Caddies, baby
Oh, look out!
Lolita, U're sweeter
But U'll never make a cheater outta me
No U won't, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
Come on!
Lolita
Your eyes, your mouth, your curly hair
U're bad, no doubt, but I must beware
Ooh, U'd get a brotha in trouble girl!
Wha...?
Lolita, U're sweeter, but I won't mislead ya
I'll feed ya, if it'll please ya, but then I'll say, "see ya"
U're fine Mama Mia but U'll never ever, ever...
No U'll never ever, ever...
No U'll never make a cheater outta me
Ay ay ay papi, deja de hablar locuras
{Hey daddy, stop talking nonsense}
No es mi culpa verme tambien Estas celoso?
{It's not my fault that I look so good. Are you jealous?}
Ah no
{Ah, no}
Entonces deja el estres y comprame un traje
{Then just stop stressing and buy me a drink}
Fellas! (Yeah!)
How bad is this girl? (Bad!)
Then what U wanna do? (Whatever U want!)
Then c'mon let's dance! (Dance!)
{repeat}
Uh!
Lolita! (Yeah)
How bad r U girl? (Bad)
Then what U wanna do? (Whatever U want)
Then c'mon let's dance! (Dance?)
Uh!
{repeat}
Imagine me on the tip o' your tongue
If I took a sip, I would be on the run
Hellhounds barkin' 'round my door
I can't sip U once 'less I sip U some more
Lolita!
