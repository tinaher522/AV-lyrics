{B-side of Partyman}
I've been diggin' U 4 such a long time
U don't even know that I'm alive
Something 'bout the way U walk just really blows my mind
Sorry but I'm sick of all this jive
Ok?
Let me touch your body baby
Let me feel U up
Come on baby, come on
Let me feel U up
Let me touch your body baby
Let me feel U up
Come on baby, come on
Let me feel U up
Something 'bout your body baby really get me hot
I'm sweating girl and it's all because of U
I don't want your credit cards or anything U got
Feel U up is all I wanna do
What do U say?
Let me touch your body baby
Let me feel U up
come on baby, come on
Let me feel U up
Let me touch your body baby
Let me feel U up
Come on baby, come on
Let me feel U up
I ain't looking 4 a 1 night stand
I only wanna feel U up
I don't really wanna be your man
I only wanna feel U up
Physical attraction babe
It's what it's all about
Hot and cold reaction
Feel U up
Turn U out
Come on baby, come on
Let me feel U up
Come on baby, come on
Let me feel U up
What's the verdict? I don't like suspense
How can U resist my burning touch?
Something 'bout the way U walk just really blows my mind
I never wanted anything so much
Ok?
Let me touch your body baby
Let me feel U up
Come on baby, come on
Let me feel U up
Let me touch your body baby
Let me feel U up
Come on baby, come on
Let me feel U up
I've been diggin' on U (4 such a long time)
I've been diggin' on U (I've been diggin' on U)
(I've been diggin' on U)
Let me touch your body baby
Let me feel U up
Come on baby, come on
Let me feel U up
I ain't looking 4 a 1 night stand
I only wanna feel U up
I don't really wanna be your man
I only wanna feel U up
Feel U up sugar sugar 
Sugar sugar
Let me touch your body baby, come on
Let me feel U up
Come on baby, come on
Let me feel U up
Let me touch your body baby, come on
Let me feel U up
Come on baby, come on
Let me feel U up 
Let me touch your body baby, come on
Let me feel U up
Come on baby, come on
(*short version fades out here*)
Let me feel U up
Let me touch your body baby, come on
Let me feel U up
come on baby, come on
Let me feel U up
What's the verdict? We don't like suspense
How can U resist my burning kiss
Feel U up, feel U up sugar sugar, huh
Let me touch your body baby come on
Let me feel U up
I ain't looking 4 a 1 night stand
I only wanna feel U up
I don't really wanna be your man
I only wanna feel U up
Physical attraction babe
That's what it's all about
Hot &amp; cold reaction
Feel U up
Turn U up
I ain't talking 'bout earning nothing baby
I only wanna feel U up
Let me touch your body baby
Let me touch your body baby
Let me feel U up
Come on baby, come on
Let me feel U up
Let me touch your body baby
Let me feel U up
Come on baby, come on
Let me feel U up
Yeah, let me feel U up
In time of trouble I'll be right there on the double
Whatever U want, whatever U need
Oh, baby, U can count on me
'Cause I'm a funky man, a funky man
I just wanna (Feel U up)
I just wanna (Feel U up)
Come on baby, come on
Let me feel U up
