<song artist="Prince" title="Ronnie,_Talk_To_Russia">
Ronnie talk to Russia before it's too late
Before it's too late
Before it's too late
Ronnie talk to Russia before it's too late
Before they blow up the world
You go to the zoo, but you can't feed guerillas
Can't feed guerillas
Left-wing guerillas
You can go to the zoo, but you don't feed guerillas
who wanna blow up the world
Ronnie if you're dead before I get to meet ya
Before I get to meet ya
Before I get to meet ya
Ronnie if you're dead before I get to meet ya
Don't say I didn't warn ya
Ronnie talk to Russia before it's too late
Before it's too late
Before it's too late
Ronnie talk to Russia before it's too late
Before they blow up the world
Before they blow up the world
Don'tcha
Don't you blow up my world
