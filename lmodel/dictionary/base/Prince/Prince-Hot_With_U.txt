Hot with u
Chorus:
I wanna get hot with u
Get u underneath the cream and ooh
Get u doing things u thought u'd never do
Make u suck your tongue and say "ooh"
I wanna get hot with u
Take u upstairs 2 the 14th room
Multicolored lights and an ocean view
Ooh, I wanna get hot with u
I wanna get hot with u {4x}
I want 2 get hot with u
I wanna get u underneath the cream
And do the marshmallow
Ooh, I wanna get hot with u
I wanna get u 2 do something
U thought u'd never do
Like dance in front of my headlights
On a hot summer night ... nude
I wanna get hot with u
Chorus
I want 2 get hot with u
I wanna make u climb this chain around my waist
So I can prove that I'm the only one that brings out
The freak in u ...
I wanna get hot with u
I wanna get hot with u {4x}
Know the body banging, got u singing
No shouts from the neighbours, telephone ringing
Put me in positions thought I'd never do proper
Created a machine, now u know u can't stop her
Trying to turn me on - I never had this, so stop this
I'm supposed 2 tremble 'cause they call u 'the artist'? 
Let's wild out - can u handle ruff riding? 
Treat u like a freak of the week and had u hiding from me
I can do whatever u like, if u could take it
If I could be your girlfriend, u could catch me naked
Can't front sexually, I'd like a sample
But I don't think I'm ready 4 u 2 make me an example
I mean - come on - why front on
I'd never place time - queen in your life
I mean - will never
The days that u feeling for me ... neutral
That I'm ready 2 call u daddy
Even get got with u

Meet me early morning in a 4th dimension plane
Astral travelling hottie, I know u know my game
Underneath the cream I'll meet u
And then we'll rearrange
Everything u know of love
I'll give u reason 2 change
Hot with u
I wanna get hot with u
(I wanna, wanna ...)
I wanna get hot with u
(I want u)
I want 2 get hot with u
I wanna steal a kiss in the middle of an
Overcrowded room, yeah
That's what I wanna do, eye-eye
I wanna get hot with u
Hot with u, ooh
Chorus
Take a drive 2 the ocean
And drown u in a wave (hot with u)
Of 100,000 compliments, boo
I want u every day (hot with u)
And 2 be cool
And the only way 2 do that is every night (hot with u)
Get hot, get hot (hot) with u (hot)
Yeah baby
I wanna get hot with u
Get u underneath the cream and ooh
Get u doing things u thought u'd never do (never)
Make u suck your tongue and say "ooh"
I wanna get hot with u
Take u upstairs 2 the 14th room (oh, honey)
Multicolored lights and an ocean view (can't u see)
Ooh, I wanna get hot with u
Hot with u
(I wanna get hot with u)
I wanna get hot with u
Get u underneath the cream and ooh
Get u doing things (ooh) u thought u'd never do
Make u suck your tongue and say "ooh" (ooh)
(ooh, ooh, ooh)
Ooh, I wanna get hot with u
Wanna get hot with u
