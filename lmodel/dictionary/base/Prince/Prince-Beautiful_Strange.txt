<song artist="Prince" title="Beautiful_Strange">
Strangely beautiful
Beautiful strange
That's what we said
instead of the name
If U count the times
He took all the blame
U would find the reason
behind the game
In the darkness
we must look 4 the way
Words so strange
that only the mind can say
If it makes no mind
what color or holy day
why is this game
the only one that we play
Dive inside your soul if U wanna know
the light inside the darkness 4ever glows
The son is like the diamond inside the coal
and like an embryo it grows and grows
