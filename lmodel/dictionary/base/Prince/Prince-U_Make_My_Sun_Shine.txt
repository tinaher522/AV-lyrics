<song artist="Prince" title="U_Make_My_Sun_Shine">
Come on over here baby, uh
Put your ass right down here on this throne, yeah 
Don't you say n'ere a little word
Until you learn how to leave, leave that devil alone 
Let me run it down, I keep your paper coming in real steady 
I could tell you what the I in the pimp stands for
If your ready, ready, ready 
Your eyes are wide shut you cannot even see
That behind your back, he calls you names 
But you're still a queen to me 
CHORUS: 
In this trusting place you can erase
Every tear that ever rolled down your weary face 
All the time you waste in that paper chase
Is time better spent in these arms of mine 
Heaven sent angel so divine
You're my complement 
U make my sun shine
U make my sun shine at night 
(ooh ohh ohh, ohh ohh ohh ohh) 
Listen to me now baby
Let me tell ya what I gotta do (tell ya) 
I gotta stop lettin' the devil
(define what it takes to be a woman) 
Stop lettin' him tell me what it takes to be a woman 
Gotta never stop believing in me, myself, and I
Pretty little lies that the rich keep using 
I opened up my eyes,
The only reason they're winning is 'cause I keep losing 
Gotta get back to my right place
This is the subject of my show 
We love the human race
This is where I belong 
Chorus 
Wonderfully, truly, caring you make the words I wish in every song. 
Come here now pretty baby let me take you somewhere and put you real close 
We've both been in the dark much too long 
Now that we got the knowledge and the truth we can both be strong 
Kings and Queens gettin' it on! 
Trusted place you can erase
Every tear that ever rolled down your weary face 
All the time you waste (wasted time)
In that paper chase 
(Can't you see that it's all time better spent right here) 
Is time better spent in these arms of mine,
(Sweet angel) 
Heaven sent angel so divine (You're so divine) 
You're my complement
U make my sun shine 
U make my sun shine at night 
Feel me
Sun shine, sun shine, sun shine at night 
Doobay doobay doobay doo
