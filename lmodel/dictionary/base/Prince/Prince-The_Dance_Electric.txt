<song artist="Prince" title="The_Dance_Electric">
Good morning children
Take a look out your window
Our world is falling
It's almost time 2 go
(Dance)
Dance the Dance Electric
The rhythm is love and love is blind
Love your enemies
There isn't much time, there isn't much time
Look - our world is falling
A rhythm-less house of blinded prophecy
Hear our Master calling
This isn't what He wanted us 2 be
We got 2 dance the Dance Electric
Listen 2 the rhythm of your soul
Come on and dance the Dance Electric
We better love each other, it's almost time 2 go
Don't - it don't make U happy
2 give another someone your own smile
Dance the dance electric
Never mind your hatred, try a brand new style
Dance the Dance Electric
Listen 2 the rhythm of your soul
U got 2 dance the Dance Electric
We better love each other, it's almost time 2 go
We... love... all... enemies
Look - U're livin' in Babylon
Makin', but not feelin' love at all
When your youth is gone, when it comes 2 dawn
A light of truth will shine and U will fall
That's why U got 2 dance the Dance Electric
Listen 2 the rhythm of your soul
U got 2 dance the Dance Electric
We better love each other, it's almost time 2 go
See the light inside of us
U're stuck in living, livin' life as bad
Whatever U do, don't U let your life go without my love
It's the only life that U will ever have
Why don't U (dance) dance the Dance Electric?
Listen 2 the rhythm of your soul
Why don't U dance the Dance Electric?
We better love each other, it's almost time 2 go (almost time 2)
Dance the Dance Electric
Listen 2 the rhythm of your soul
Come on and dance the Dance Electric
We better love each other, it's almost time 2 go
