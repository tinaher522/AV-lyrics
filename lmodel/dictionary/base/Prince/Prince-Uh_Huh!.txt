<song artist="Prince" title="Uh_Huh!">
Know when it's right
U know when U feel it, baby
U hold it, U hear it, U touch it, it's right
Everybody know who's U, who's U
When it's real soul
Ain't no way 2 fight it
Sing it girls
(Uh-huh!) {repeat in song}
Ah yeah
Yeah, yeah
When I was a little itty bitty baby
Yo, cookin' in the belly, wasn't even born
The way my mama tell it, drove that woman crazy
Every time I hear the music, I start kickin' on the 2 and 4, oh!
Uh-huh! - U got the right one, baby
Uh-huh! - U got the one U need
Uh-huh! - U got the right one, baby
Uh-huh! - cuz it's the one it's got 2 be
Remember now, when I was just a little boy of 7
Preacher man, Sunday mornin' talk about heaven and hell
"Hey brother, if U don't believe and change your evil ways
The rain gonna come, there won't be nowhere 2 run
Nobody 2 tell ya?
Uh-huh! - U got the right one, baby
Uh-huh! - U got the one U need
Uh-huh! - U got the right one, baby
Uh-huh!Â ?it's the one it got 2 be, alright
Hey now pretty sweet thing, tell me where U got that walk
I feel it when U hold my hand, U got these old knees just-a-knockin'
When, when U give me that kiss, fill me through and through, huh
I don't know where U got it, girl, but don't U dare stop doin' what U do
Uh-huh! - U got the right one, baby
Uh-huh! - U got the one U need
Uh-huh! - yeah, U got the right one, baby
Uh-huh! - cuz it's the one it's got 2 be
If I already ain't change your mind, tell U one more story
Only a man that's truly blind can't see the glory
Think about what U're doin' here, think about what U say
If U shine the light on your brother when he's lost his way
Then guess what?
Uh-huh! - U got the right one, baby
Uh-huh! - U got the one U need
Uh-huh! - U got the right one, baby
This irrepressible lover boy can not misjudge one another
Let me suppose U got the right one, baby
One more, one more
CHORUS {Parts repeat in BG}
