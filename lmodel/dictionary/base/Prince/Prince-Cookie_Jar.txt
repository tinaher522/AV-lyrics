<song artist="Prince" title="Cookie_Jar">
{"Jesus" &amp; "Baby" sample in BG throughout} 
Another life goes 2 the winner 
Another soul goes 2 the dream 
Another hell goes 2 the sinner 
Don't give up no matter how tough it seems 
Come and dig the power of somethin' above ya 
It was there all along cuz it was made 2 love ya 
It gave your flowers rain 
Even though U won't play His game 
U push it away but still it's pullin' 4 ya (I don't know) 
CHORUS: 
I don't know what He'll do witcha when He getcha 
Put U in His cookie jar, save U 4 a rainy day 
I don't know what He'll do witcha when He getcha 
Put U in His cookie jar, save U 4 a rainy day 
He might need U on the Eve Of Destruction 
2 co-sign His order on that Judgment Day 
Shout His name from the highest hill 
The bigger the headache, the bigger the pill 
Every purple mutha need 2 look His way 
The funk is here 2 stay 
CHORUS 
(I don't know) 
Another life goes 2 the winner 
Another soul goes 2 the dream 
Another hell goes 2 the sinner 
Don't give up no matter how tough it seems 
All in all, we got 2 come 2gether 
And make a world that's 7 light-years better 
Come on, don't be shy 
So they're laughin' high 
It's waiting 4 those who can storm the weather 
Hey! 
I don't know what He'll do witcha when He getcha 
I don't know what He'll do witcha when He getcha 
Put U in His cookie jar, save U 4 a rainy day (Save ya, save ya)

I say I don't know 
(CHORUS) 
Save ya, baby 
Oh no, yeah 
(CHORUS) 
I.. I.. I.. oh I 
Save, save, save me baby 
I.. I.. 
I.. I.. I don't know what He'll do witcha 
I.. I.. 
I.. I.. I.. I.. I don't know what He'll do witcha when He getcha
Put U in His cookie jar, save U 4 a rainy day 
Baby 
I.. 
Save me now, baby, no! 
(CHORUS) 
Baby 
CHORUS 
(Save me baby, save me baby) 
I don't know what He'll do witcha when He getcha {x2} 
(I don't know, I.. I..) 
I don't know what He'll do witcha when He getcha 
Put U in His cookie jar, save U 4 a rainy day {fade out}
