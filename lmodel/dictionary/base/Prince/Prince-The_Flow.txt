<song artist="Prince" title="The_Flow">
Contradiction - my prediction is that
It is really important where I take my naps? (No!)
Or who I sleep with?
People with the real mind will peep this out (Yo, out)
Then there goes your clout
Another fool don't know what she talkin' 'bout
Like the woman who tried 2 approach and attempt 2 roast (What?)
And even boast about how she knew me when (What'd she say?)
Damn, here we go again
U never went 2 school as far as I know
And now U're trying 2 say that U're writing a bio about me? (Oops)
Girl, I hate 2 say this - nigga, please! (Tell 'em)
I go places that U never go
Ask what I'm kickin' (Yo)
I'm kickin' the flow
Rock 2 the F.L.O.W. (Wait a minute) (Minneapolis, Minneapolis)
Just like U're supposed 2 do (Minneapolis, Minneapolis)
Rock 2 the F.L.O.W. (Wait a minute) (Don't kill me please)
(No, no, I ain't, I ain't go'n kill U, man)
Just like U're supposed 2 do (Tony, shoot that piece of shit!)
Just give me the beat and something 2 flow on
And before long I have 'em bobbin' their Jugheads 2 this funky song
Yeah, I'm watchin' people scatter 2 the dance floor
Slammin' and shakin' their booties screamin' "Yo T, gimme more!" (More)
So more is what I give 'em
NPG's rocking the track - yo, tell me how we're livin' (Livin' large T)
Yeah, hah, U damn right, that's how it be (I see)
Gotta keep it that way so that 5-0 can't find me
And I'm sneakin' up the back of the pack of rats
They thought I was asleep, but I'm sayin' it ain't all that (Naw!)
Yeah, not with a 9 fadin' my back
I don't hang with the hat pack (Bang!)
Yo, I'm running silent - solo black
Sleek neat creepin' gang people (Oh)
Rather put a damn fool 2 sleep who pulls a cheap one (Whatcha do?)
That's when I change my speed and flow on
Then I start slipping', skipping' 'n' jumping' around so much
I say bring it on
Rock 2 the F.L.O.W. (Wait a minute) (Minneapolis, Minneapolis)
Just like U're supposed 2 do (Minneapolis, Minneapolis)
(2 beat the English)
Rock 2 the F.L.O.W. (Wait a minute) (Minneapolis, Minneapolis)
(We gotta feed U?)
Just like U're supposed 2 do (2 beat the English)
(2 beat the English) {x3}
(Ladies and gentlemen) {x2}
Rock 2 the F.L.O.W.
Just like U're supposed 2 do
(Ladies and gentlemen)
Rock 2 the F.L.O.W.
Just like U're supposed 2 do
Rock {x4}
