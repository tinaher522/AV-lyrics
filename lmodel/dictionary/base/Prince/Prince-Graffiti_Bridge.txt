<song artist="Prince" title="Graffiti_Bridge">
everybody wants 2 find Graffiti Bridge
something 2 believe in, a reason 2 believe that there's a heaven above
everybody wants 2 find Graffiti Bridge
everybody's looking 4
everybody's looking 4
everybody's looking 4 love
everybody wants 2 find the perfect 1
someone that makes u happy, someone that makes u laugh when u want 2 cry
everybody wants to find the perfect 1
everybody's looking 4
everybody's looking 4
everybody's looking 4 love
the love of a boy, the love of a girl
the love that comes from a warm heart in a cold cold world
everybody wants 2 find Graffiti Bridge
something 2 believe in, a reason 2 believe that there's a heaven above
everybody wants 2 find Graffiti Bridge
everybody's looking 4
everybody's looking 4
everybody's looking 4 love
everybody wants 2 find Graffiti Bridge
(people throw away your arms of fire)
a bridge that leads
a bridge that leads them 2 a love they know is real
(let democracy take u higher)
everybody wants 2 find Graffiti Bridge
everybody's looking 4 (if you believe)
everybody's looking 4 (wave your hands)
everybody's looking 4 love (on the power of love)
(Love is shining)
(everybody wants 2 find Graffiti Bridge)
there's a future (sure, you're right) a future worth fighting 4
I'm a living witness
everybody wants 2 find Graffiti Bridge
ooo, everything's gonna be alright, alright, alright
everybodys looking 4
everybodys looking 4
everybodys looking 4 love
there is a future (a future worth fighting 4)
worth fighting 4 
yes it is, I know it is
everything will be alright
everybody wants 2 find Graffiti Bridge
