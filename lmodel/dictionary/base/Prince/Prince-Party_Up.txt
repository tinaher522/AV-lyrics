<song artist="Prince" title="Party_Up">
We don't give a damn, we just want to jam
Party up
(Party up, got to party up)
That army bag, such a double drag
Party up
(Party up, got to, got to, got to party up)
(Party)
Got to party down, baby
Revolutionary rock and roll
Goin' uptown, baby
How you gonna make me kill somebody, I don't even know?
They got the draft, I just laugh
Party up
(Party up, got to party up)
Fightin' war is such a fuckin' bore
Party up
(Party up, got to, got to, got to party up)
(Party)
Got to party down, babe
It's all about what's in your mind
Goin' uptown, baby
I don't wanna die, I just wanna have a bloody good time
Party up, got to party up
Party up, got to party up
Because of their half-baked mistakes
We get ice cream, no cake
All lies, no truth
Is it fair to kill the youth?
Party up
Got to party up, yeah
Got to party up, babe
Got to party up, yeah
Got to party up, babe
Got to party up, yeah
Got to party up, babe
Got to party up, yeah
Got to party up, babe
Yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah
(Party up, got to party up)
Party up, got to party up, baby
(Party up, got to party up)
Party up, got to party up, baby
(Party up, got to party up)
Party up, got to party up, baby
(Party up, got to party up)
Got to party
(Party up, got to party up)
Got to party
(Party up, got to party up)
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
(Party up, got to party up)
Got to party up baby
(Party up, got to party up)
Revolutionary rock and roll
Party up, got to party up
Party up, got to party up
Party up, got to party up
Party up, got to party up
Party up, got to party up
Party up, got to party up, baby
Party up, got to party up
You're gonna have to fight your own damn war
(Party up, got to party up)
'Cuz we don't wanna fight no more
(Party up, got to party up)
You're gonna have to fight your own damn war
(Party up, got to party up)
'Cuz we don't wanna fight no more
(Party up, got to party up)
You're gonna have to fight your own damn war
(Party up, got to party up)
'Cuz we don't wanna fight no more
(Party up, got to party up)
I said we don't wanna fight no more
(Gonna have to fight your own damn war)
We don't wanna fight no more
