<song artist="Prince" title="Magnificent">
Yeah
So much anticipation
4 this conversation
Such a long time
Life a meeting of two nations
This special occasion
Got us both tongue tied
Let me just say that Eye've respected U
From a distance
Eye've been watching U, sho' been watching you
In the time it took the others 2 say Ur name
We became magnificence
(Chorus:)
What Eye'm about 2 say will astound U
But Eye can only say it when no one's around U
Magnificent
Magnificent, when it pounds you
Magnificent
The voice that U hear is the alchemy of Ur mind
The two of us like stardust
We go back, yeah we must
To the dawning of all time
To the nuclear reaction
The only present satisfaction
The sweet and sticky kind
Regardless of what they say 2 U
The moment U hear me speak they're through
Like paradise Eye'm so nice
Eye never lose my effect on U
(Chorus)
The voice that U hear is the alchemy of Ur mind
Counting backwards, a thousand 2 one
Everything we do is so much fun
To our time before time began
Before Eye was a woman, before U were a man
Before sex and race ever mattered
Tell me now do U understand?
(Chorus)
