<song artist="Prince" title="Power_Fantastic">
Late at night, when the world is sleeping
U r frightened, 'cause the power's creeping
In your room is something u're afraid of
Life or doom is what this feelings made of
Power fantastic
Is in your life at last
U're a little apprehensive
'cause what it is is what u want and need
Minor g is the chord of pleasure
It will be played eleven measures
U will see fire, but u're cool as ice
U lie if u say this isn't nice.
Power fantastic
Is in your life at last
U're a little apprehensive
What it is is what u want and need
Power, power
Power fantastic
Is in your life at last
U're a wee bit apprehensive
'cause what it is is what u want and need
Power, power, power fantastic
