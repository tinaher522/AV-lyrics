<song artist="Prince" title="Black_Sweat">
Workin', workin' up a black sweat {x4}
I don't wanna take my clothes off, but I do
I don't wanna turn nobody on 'less it's U, oh
I don't wanna dance 2 hard, baby
But this is a groove (Yes it is, funky)
I'm hot, and I don't care who knows it
I got a job 2 do, yes (Think I don't, come on, come on, uh)
I'm workin', workin' up a black sweat
I'm workin', workin' up a black sweat
I'm workin'
Workin', workin' up a black sweat {x2}
I don't wanna break your pride (Pride)
But I got 2 (Got 2 hurt 'em, gon' hurt 'em y'all)
U bet' take your woman and hide her (Hide)
Cuz I'm about 2... (Tell 'em what U're 'bout 2 do, boy)
Got 2, got 2 show U what's really good (show U what's really good)
Break U off like U knew I would (Like U knew I would)
I got a brand new dance (I got a brand new dance)
And it's called the... uh!
Workin', workin' up a black sweat
I'm workin', workin' up a black sweat
I'm workin'
Workin', workin' up a black sweat {x3}
Workin'
Breakdown...
U can act hard if U want 2
This groove'll make U sweet
U b screamin' like a white lady
When I count 2 three
1, 2, 3!
Workin', workin' up a black sweat
I'm workin', workin' up a black sweat
I'm workin', workin' up a black
Workin', workin' up a black, hey!
Black sweat
