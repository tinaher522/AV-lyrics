<song artist="Prince" title="Peach_(Xtended_Jam)">
Turn the house lights on 
On the one
Not on me, on them, 2, 3, come on
Yeah, that's what I'm talkin' about
Leave it right there
Ain't nothin' 2 look at, ain't nothin' 2 look at
Y'all just party where U are, uh, party where U are
We gon' keep this groove going 4 20 minutes
It ain't over, it ain't over {repeated by audience}
Come on up and dance
Come up on this stage
On the one
Come up on this stage, girl, U know U got 2 dance, 2, 3, come on
Portland, U 2 sexy 2night!
Uh oh, here she come, y'all
Wearing them gold hot pants again
I wanna talk, but I don't know
She's a, she's a peach
Turn around, aye, yeah!
Shuffle little bit, band
Come on!
What's the chant y'all, what's the chant?
It ain't over, it ain't over
Say what? (It ain't over, it ain't over {repeated by audience})
Can't hear U
Can't hear U, now
Solo Renato, aye!
It's 2 funky in here, y'all
G.W. turn them lights back up
Yeah 
Hands in the air {x4}
It ain't over, it ain't over 
Say it (It ain't over, it ain't over {repeated by audience})
Say what? {x2}
Say what, now?
Can't hear U {x2}
What do I hear
Sounding good 2 my ear?
Say what do I hear
Sounding good 2 my ear, oh yeah?
2 and 4 y'all clap your hands, come on {x2}
I wanna hear that hand clap
On the one, clap your hands
Y'all know what 2 do
