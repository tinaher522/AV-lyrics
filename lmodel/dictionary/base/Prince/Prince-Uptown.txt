<song artist="Prince" title="Uptown">
She saw me walking down the streets of your fine city
It kinda turned me on when she looked at me and said, "C'mere"
Now I don't usually talk to strangers but she looked so pretty
What can I lose if I, uh, just give her a little ear?
"What's up little girl? I ain't got time to play."
Baby didn't say too much; she said, "Are you gay?"
Kinda took me by suprise, I didn't know what to do
I just looked her in her eyes and I said, "No, are u?"
Said to myself, said
"She's just a crazy, crazy, crazy little mixed up dame.
She's just a victim of society and all it's games."
Now where I come from, we don't let society
Tell us how it's supposed to be
Our clothes, our hair, we don't care
It's all about being there
Everybody's going Uptown; that's where I wanna be
Uptown, set your mind free
Uptown, got my body hot
Get down, I don't wanna stop, no
As soon as we got therebgood times were rolling
White, Black, Puerto Rican
Everybody just a-freakin'
Good times were rolling
She started dancing in the streets
Ow, girl, she's just gone mad
U know, she even made love to me
Ooh, best night I ever had
Ah yeah
I never talk to strangers but this time it's all right
See, she got me hot, ah, I couldn't stop, ah
Good times were rolling all night, all night, yeah
Now where I come from we don't give a damn
We do whatever we please
It ain't about no downtown, nowhere bound, narrow-minded drag
It's all about being free
Everybody's going Uptown
It's where I wanna be
Uptown,  can set your mind free, yeah
Uptown, keep your body hot
Get down, I don't wanna stop, no
Uptown, ooh, ooh, yeah
Uptown
Everybody's going, everybody's going
Everybody gotta gotta
Uptown, now go-go-go, go-go-go
They're going Uptown
Uptown, yeah, yeah, now, all now
Uptown, gotta go-go-go
Uptown, yeah, gotta go, gotta go
Uptown, c'mon, c'mon, you 
U have to, you gotta go
Uptown, oh yeah, YEAH!
