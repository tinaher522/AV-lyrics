<song artist="Prince" title="I_Could_Never_Take_The_Place_Of_Your_Man">
It was only last June when her old man ran away
She couldn't stop crying 'cause she knew he was gone 2 stay
10:35 on a lonely Friday night
She was standin' by the bar
Mmm, she was lookin' alright, yeah
I asked her if she wanted 2 dance and she said that
All she wanted was a good man and wanted 2 know
If I thought I was qualified, yeah
And I said, baby don't waste your time
I know what's on your mind
I may be qualified 4 a one night stand
But I could never take the place of your man
It hurt me so bad when she told me with tears in her eyes 
(Tears in her eyes)
He was all she ever had and now she wanted 2 die
He left her with a baby and another one on the way, yeah
She couldn't stop cryin'
Cause she knew he was gone 2 stay, yeah
She asked me if we could be friends
And I said, oh, honey baby that's a dead end
U know and I know 
That we wouldn't be satisfied, oh-no
And I said, baby don't waste your time
I know what's on your mind
U wouldn't be satisfied 
With a one night stand
And I could never take the place of your man
Yeah, yeah, the place of your man
