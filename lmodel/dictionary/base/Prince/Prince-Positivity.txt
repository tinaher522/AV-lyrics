<song artist="Prince" title="Positivity">
Yes {echoed}
Chorus:
Positivity - yes
Have U had your plus sign 2day?
Positivity - yes
Do we mark U present or do we mark U late?
Is that a good man
Walking down the street with that money in his hand?
Is that a good man?
Why do U dog him?
If that was your father, tell me, would U dog him then?
Would U dog him?
CHORUS
Is that all your gold?
Where did it come from?
What did U have 2 do? (What did U have 2 do?)
Can U sleep nights?
Do U dream straight up or do U dream in W's?
CHORUS
(Yeah)
Na na na na na na, so slow
Positivity - yes
Na na na na na na, so slow
Can a boy who drops out of school at 13 years of age
Answer the Q of life and death when it slaps him in the face?
(Na na na na na na, so slow)
Who's 2 blame when he's got no place 2 go
And all he's got is the sense 2 know
That a life of crime will help him beat U in the race
Will help him beat U in the race
Positivity
CHORUS
Na na na na na na, so slow (Na na na na na, so slow)
CHORUS
(Say it)
(Yes)
(Ooh yes)
Na na na na na na, so slow (Say it again)
Na na na na na na, so slow (Na na na na na, so slow)
Positivity - yes
(Na na na na na na, so slow)
Wave your hand 4 positivity y'all!
All the boys and all the girls (All the boys, all the girls)
U are the new kings of the world!
Shall the court sing together?
"In every man's life there will be a hang-up
A whirlwind designed 2 slow U down
It cuts like a knife and tries 2 get in U
This Spooky Electric sound
Give up if U want 2 and all is lost
Spooky Electric will be your boss"
Call People Magazine, Rolling Stone
Call your next of kin, cuz your ass is gone
He got a 57 mag with the price tag still on the side - uh!
Cuzzin' when Spooky say dead, U better say died
Or U can fly high right by Spooky and all that he crawls 4
Spooky and all that he crawls 4
Don't kiss the beast
(Love &amp; honesty, peace &amp; harmony)
Positivity
Love &amp; honesty, peace &amp; harmony
Say hold on 2 your soul, U got a long way 2 go
Sho' nuff {x3}
Don't kiss the beast
Be superior at least
Hold on 2 your soul, y'all, court, sing!
Hold on 2 your soul, we got a long way 2 go
Hold on 2 your soul
