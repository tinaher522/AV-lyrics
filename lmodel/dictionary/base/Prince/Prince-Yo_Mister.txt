Yo Mister how's your daughter 
You really ought to know 
For every thing you taught her 
Don't matter when she's all alone 
My crazy friend named Cara 
After all of us told her, âNoâ 
She'd get another speed ball 
Now she's going no where slow 
Her papa caught her on the first time 
And put her out on the street 
Cara told me to remind him 
That she was only 17 
Yo Mister how's your daughter (How's your girl) 
You really ought to know 
Every thing you taught her 
It don't matter when she's all alone 
Cara got hooked up with the wrong kids 
Then she started skipping school 
Then Cara got high to make disappear 
A world full of fools 
In her eyes her father was the biggest fool of them all 
And she was speeding, that's what she'd say 
Maybe, maybe, maybe she wouldn't talk so stupid 
If she knew how much she needed this fool today
Yo Mister how's your daughter 
You really ought to know 
For every thing you taught her 
Don't matter when she's all alone 
She needs you right now Mister 
âCause she ain't got long to live 
It's so easy to say, âI love youâ 
But it's harder to forgive
Her father cried when I told him 
That Cara twice got knocked up 
He said, âJust like her mama, uh-huh 
She shows her body when she wants to show love 
She tried that stuff with me and I beat her downâ 
There's no way I could let her stay 
Couldn't let her stick around 
âCause I tried so hard to raise her right 
He said, âWhat made her turn out this wayâ 
I don't know 
What made her turn out this way 
I don't know, I don't know 
And I said and I said and I said 
Yo Mister how's your daughter 
You really ought to know (Every thing) 
Every thing you taught her 
Don't matter when she's all alone 
She needs you right now Mister 
She ain't got long to live 
It's so easy to say, âI love youâ 
But it's harder to forgive
Yo Mister how's your daughter (How's your daughter tonight) 
Yo Mister how's your daughter (How's your daughter tonight) 
Yo Mister how's your daughter (How's your daughter tonight) 
Yo Mister how's your daughter (How's your daughter tonight)
