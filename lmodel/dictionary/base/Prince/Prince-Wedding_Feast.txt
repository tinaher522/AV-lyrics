<song artist="Prince" title="Wedding_Feast">
Brother, dear brother, I came as quickly as I could
The digital haze is broken
The Banished Ones are gone 4 good
Gone 4 good
Now there must be a wedding (Wedding)
Now there must be a feast
A feast, a feast
A smorgasbord at least
A brunch, a munch
Of cake, if just a piece
Not just a vat of chitlins
Or turkey meat, U see
We are what we eat
So we must eat a leaf
We'll dine under a tree
Unless it snows {laughter}
