<song artist="Prince" title="Journey_2_The_Center_Of_Your_Heart">
I know U've been hurt before
I can see it in your eyes
And if U just close the door
I would not be surprised
Even though I know U've heard it
These words I'm tryin' 2 say
I think the others only flirted
With the true meaning of always
U can say what U wanna
But I ain't gonna stop this journey 2 the center of your heart
No, no
Heart (Heart)
I see the candle through your window
Burns there every night
The shadow leaves an innuendo
Of no one holding U tight
Many nights I've dreamt U near me
But awaken 2 U gone (Gone)
I know one day U'll hear me
I don't care how long
U can say what U wanna
But I ain't gonna stop this journey 2 the center of your heart
Oh yeah
(Journey center of your heart)
Journey 2 the center of your heart
Heart
I've waited a lifetime, baby
Just 2 know your name
We've done everything in our minds
Let's stop the game (Let's stop it)
Even though I know U've heard
These words I'm tryin' 2 say
Somehow I think these others, they only flirted
With the true meaning of always
(U can say what U wanna)
Oh, U can say what U wanna
(But I ain't gonna stop this journey 2)
But I ain't gonna stop this journey 2 the center ... (Heart)
(U can say what U wanna)
(But I ain't gonna stop this journey 2 the center of your heart)
Heart, heart
(Heart) (repeat in BG)
Your heart (x3)
