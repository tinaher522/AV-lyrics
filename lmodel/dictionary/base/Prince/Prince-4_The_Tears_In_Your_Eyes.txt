<song artist="Prince" title="4_The_Tears_In_Your_Eyes">
Long ago there was a man
Changed stone 2 bread with one touch of his hand
He made the blind see and the dumb understand
He died 4 the tears in your eyes, your eyes
Many people came from all around
2 hear this man preach with glorious sound
He spoke of man in harmony and love abound
He died 4 the tears in your eyes, your eyes 
Your eyes, your eyes
He died 4 the tears in your eyes
4 the tears in your eyes if they're tears of sorrow
4 cents may be all that they're worth
4 the rising sun each day assures us
The meek shall inherit the earth, the earth
Faith is a word we all should try
Describing the man who willingly died
Believe that your hunger, sorrow, and fears
Is less than the tears in your eyes, your eyes
Less than the tears in your eyes
4 the tears in your eyes if they're tears of sorrow
4 cents may be all that they're worth (All they're worth)
4 the rising sun each day assures us
The meek shall inherit the earth (Say it again)
4 the tears in your eyes if they're tears of sorrow
4 cents may be all that they're worth (All they're worth)
4 the rising sun each day assures us
The meek shall inherit the earth, the earth
Thank U
