Prince: Taxi, taxi
Prince and Revolution:
Lady, cab driver, can u take me 4 a ride
Don't know where I'm going, 'cause I don't where I've been,
Just put your foot on the gas, let's drive
Lady, don't ask questions...
I promise I'll tell you no lies
Trouble winds are blowing, I'm growing cold
Get me outta' here... feel I'm gonna' die
Lady, cab driver,
Roll up your window fast
Lately, trouble winds are blowin' hard
And I don't know if I can last
Lady, I'm so lonely,
I know that's not the way to be,
Don't like isolation, but the air it makes me cold
Drive it baby, drive it, drive this demon out of me
Take me, to your mansion...
Honey let's go everywhere
Help me girl I'm drowning,
Mass confusion in my head
Will U accept my tears to pay the fare
Lady, cab driver
Roll up your window fast
Lately, trouble winds are blowin' hard
And I don't know if I can last
Ohhhh!!
Lady, cab driver
Can U take me 4 a ride
Lady , cab driver
Roll up your window fast
Lately, trouble winds are blowin' hard
And I don't know if I can last
Prince's Rap:(with sounds of woman moaning
in the background, along with a sqeaking bed
throughout)
THIS is 4 the cab u have 2 drive for no money at all,
THIS is 4 why I wasn't born like my brother, handsome and tall,
THIS is 4 politicians, who are bored and  believe in war,
And this...mmm, yeah that's for me, that's who that one's 4
THIS is 4 discrimination, and egotist's who think supreme,
THIS is 4 whoever taught u how 2 kiss in designer jeans,
Oh, THAT one's for, THAT one's for, where u have 2 live,
THIS one's 4 the rich, not all of 'em, just the greedy...
The ones who don't know how 2 give
THIS one's 4 Yosemite Sam, and the tourists at Disneyland,
THIS one, ooooh, yeah, that's the one
THAT'S 4, that's 4, the creator of man
THIS one's 4 the sun, moon, stars...tourists at Disneyland
THIS one's 4 the ocean, the sea, the shore...
THIS one's 4....and THAT'S 4 u, that's who that one's 4,
THIS is 4 the women, so beautifully complex,
THIS  is 4 the love without sex,
THIS is 4 the wind, that blows no matter how fast or slow
Not knowing where I'm going is galaxies better
Than not having a place to go, now I know, now I know
Prince and Revolution:
Lady, cab driver
repeated several times to end
Hey man, thats my taxi!
