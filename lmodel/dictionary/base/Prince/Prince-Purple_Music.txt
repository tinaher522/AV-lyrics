<song artist="Prince" title="Purple_Music">
CHORUS:
Don't need no reefer, don't need cocaine
Purple music does the same 2 my brain
And I'm high, so high
Don't need no cymbals, no saxophone
Just need 2 find me a style of my own
And I'm high, so high
Some people can't understand
Just bein' inside a church don't make a righteous man
U're high, so high
In time we all die, all music gone
So we better try our best 2 get along
And get high, so high, oh
Ain't got no theory, ain't got no rules
I just let the purple music tell my body what 2 do
And I'm high, so high
Every subject, any key
Purple music can't be judged, it happens naturally
It's alright, alright, oh
We'll find a serpent 2 sacrifice
We'll make a wish and then we'll visit purple paradise
We'll get high, yes we will, so high
CHORUS
Next page ...
Don't want reaction, I just want the act
It's easier 2 give love than it is 2 give it back
Cuz I'm high, so high
Oh, oh, oh
No reefer, don't need cocaine
Purple music does the same 2 my brain
And I'm high, oh
Don't need no cymbals, no saxophone
I just need 2 find me a style of my own
And I'm high, oh
I'd love some
I'm high, so high
CHORUS
We'll find a sacrifice
2 get some purple paradise
So nice, purple paradise is so nice
Yeah!
Baby, baby, I say, I say, I say
Oh, oh, oh yeah, oh yeah
If U understand my color
Put your hand in your crotch
No, no, no, no, no, yes!
CHORUS
Don't need no cymbals, no saxophone
I just need 2 find me a style of my own
And I'm high, so high
Some people can't understand
Just bein' inside a church don't make a righteous man
And U're high
U got 2 be high
In time we all die, all music gone
So we better try 2 get along
And get high, so high
All get high
I ain't got no theory, I ain't got no rules
I just let the purple music tell my body what 2 do
And I'm high, so high
Every subject, any key
Purple music can't be judged, it happens naturally
Ain't it alright?
Ain't it alright?
Don't try 2 fight it
It's time 4 your morning bath, sir
What would U like 2 bathe in this morning?
With all due respect sir, I think that it ..
I think that it might ..
Oh, oh no
I don't want 2 play anymore {x2}
Purple music does things 2 my brain and I'm high
Step on it
That's right
Drive, U idiot
Faster, faster!
Don't need no reefer, don't need cocaine
Purple music does the same 2 my brain
And I'm high, oh yeah
Don't need no cymbals, no saxophone
I just need 2 find me a style of my own
And I'm high
Some people can't understand
Just bein' inside a church don't make a righteous man
And U're high, yeah
