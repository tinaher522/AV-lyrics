<song artist="Prince" title="Sex">
So my name is Endorphin, I can make U happy U see
I come from planet Venus and I'll take U there
You could be my ecstasy
The 80's are over and the time has come
for a new proclamation of love and fun
Monogamy and trust, is what I'm talkin' 'bout
I'll give up all my lovers if U can make me shout
Oh
S is for scandalous
E is for exciting
X is for adults only
let's do something frightening
Sex, sex, can't stop the feelin' baby, nobody should
Sex, sex, anything this dangerous, has to be good
Now I'm the type of alien, who knows just what he wants
But U're the type who plays in the trees
you got it, maybe that's why you float
I climb a thousand trees if I have to
but baby I'm warnin' you
one of us is gonna end up on our knees
Sex, sex, can't stop the feelin' baby, nobody should
Sex, sex, anything this dangerous, has to be good
good, good
just has to be sex 
sex
(get up) on the chair baby, let me dance under your skirt (get up)
everybody on the dance floor now
get up, on the table now, let me show you how to flirt (get up)
I like it baby, when U let me touch U there
I like it, girl, I knew you wasn't wearin' any underwear
baby, is it wrong, that I want U so
I want U baby, I want U now
S.E.X.
Sex, sex, can't stop the feelin' baby, nobody should
Sex, sex, anything this dangerous, has to be good
Just has to be good
Fellas - all the boys that know 'bout the good thing, say yeah yeah
and all the girls with no underwear on say yes (yes)
we're gettin' funky tonight
sex
yo, pick this up
fellas, I want everybody sayin'it on the one, come on: "S.E.X."
Say it S.E.X. come on S.E.X. say it S.E.X.
Keep that goin', Fellas
Come on (S.E.X.) yeah (S.E.X.) come on (S.E.X.)
ladies (S.E.X.), back'em up (S.E.X.), one time: "is the best"
come on (is the best, is the best, is the best)
one lover: sex (I don't think U heard me)
one lover: sex (yeah)
two lovers: death (quit it)
two lovers: death
So my name is Endorphin, I can make U happy U see
I come from planet Venus and I'll take U there
You can be my ecstasy
Now's the time 4 U 2 rock the nation with love and fun
Do the nasty with one love, but only one
Oh Sex
