Oh yeah!
Something's the matter baby, I'm going insane
Something inside of me keeps talkin' 2 my brain
Why can't I stop this satanic lust?
I know I shouldn't hold U, but my body says I must
I'm possessed, ooh
And I don't know what 2 do
Ooh, I'm possessed, yes, ooh
I'm stone crazy in love with U
Something's the matter baby, U're all I see
Your voice is all I hear beggin' 2 me
I wish I didn't need U, wish I didn't care
I've got 2 make some love 2 U cuz it much 2 much 2 bare
I'm possessed, yes I am
And I don't know what 2 do
Ooh, I'm possessed, oh

Don't know what 2 do

Something's the matter baby, my mind's in a daze
I'm trippin' on your love, it's so hard 4 me 2 lay
Can't stop this yearnin', Lord knows I've tried
Free me from dispair, I'm much 2 young 2 die
