<song artist="Prince" title="Partyman">
"Gentlemen, let's broaden our minds! Lawrence!"
Oh, yeah yeah!
All hail the new king in town
Young and old, gather 'round (Yeah)
Black and white, red and green (Yeah, funky)
The funkiest man U've ever seen
Tell U what his name is
Partyman, Partyman
Rock a party like nobody can
Rules and regulations, no place in this nation
Partyman, Partyman
Party people say it now (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Somebody holla if U wanna party {crowd noise}
"Ladies and gentlemen, no pictures please"
Get it up, oh yeah!
Partyman, P-Partyman
Get it up, g-get it up, yeah
"Ohh, I love purple!"
I rock the party, I rock the house
I rock the whole world north, east and south
In the west, 17 horns blowin'
Partyman, Partyman (Lose me old boy)
Get it up, sing!
"All hail the new king in town!"
Ain't nuthin but a muffin
We got a lotta butter 2 go (Say I oughta knock U in, but don't come no)=
If it break when it bend
U better not put it in
Get it up (Ride 'em, boy)
Partyman, P-Partyman (P-P-Partyman, Partyman)
Partyman, Partyman
Young and old gather 'round
Everybody hail the new king in town!
