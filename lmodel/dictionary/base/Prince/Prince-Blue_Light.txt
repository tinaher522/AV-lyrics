<song artist="Prince" title="Blue_Light">
Oh well, here we are again
Lookin' 4 something 2 get us in the mood
I tell each and every one of my friends
That the love we make is really pretty rude
But they don't believe me cuz it's written all over my face
Like Evian and the deep blue sea
U and me got different taste
U like it in the dark but I like aâ€¦
CHORUS:
Blue light
Can U turn on a blue light?
Then cuddle up 2 me so tight
Just U and me all night, alright
Blue light
Can U turn on a blue light?
Then everything will be alright
Oh, blue light
U say U wish I was shy
I always take a simple thing and push it way 2 far
But baby, that's the problem with U and I
U say not in public but I say in the car, mm
Say, we need 2 get wild again like it was when we first met
Close your eyes and count 2 10 and when U open 'em
I'll be standing naked with nothing but a smile on
CHORUS
(Well)
I'll be 117
U'll be still sayin' - "Baby, not 2night"
Well, it's easy 2 see us on the cover of a magazine, huh
"Double heart attack, couple both died in a fight"
Well baby, I don't wanna cross that road cuz I love U 2 much
I'd do anything just 2 heat up your cold touch
Anything I would do, but up until u tell me 2
CHORUS
Hey
Blue light
Can U turn on a blue light?
(Cuddle up 2 me so tight)
Cuddle up next 2 me, baby
U and me all night, alright
Blue light (Light)
Can U turn on a blue light?
And everything will be alright
Oh, blue light {x3}
Blue light {repeat 2 fade}
