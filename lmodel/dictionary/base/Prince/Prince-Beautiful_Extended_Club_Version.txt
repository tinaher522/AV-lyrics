Beautiful
Tick tock U don't stop
Beautiful
Beautiful
Beautiful
Beautiful
Beautiful
And when the stars fall one by one from the sky
I know Mars could not be 2 far behind
'cause baby, this kind of beauty has got no reason 2 ever be shy
'cause honey this kind of beauty is the kind that comes from inside
Could U be
The Most Beautiful Girl in the World (Beautiful)
It's plain 2 see
U're the reason that God made a girl (Beautiful)
Could U be
The Most Beautiful Girl in the World
It's plain 2 see
U're the reason that God made a girl
When the day turns into the last day of all time
I can say, I hope that U are in these arms of mine (Oh yeah) (Beautiful)
When the night falls before that day I will cry
I will cry tears of joy cause after U all one can do is die (Oh yeah)
Could U be
The Most Beautiful Girl in the World (Beautiful)
It's plain 2 see
U're the reason that God made a girl (Beautiful)
Could U be
The Most Beautiful Girl in the World (Beautiful)
It's plain 2 see
U're the reason that God made a girl (Beautiful)
How can I get through days when I can't get through hours
(Tick tock U don't stop, tick tock U don't stop)
I can try but when I do I see U and I'm devoured
Oh Yes
Who'd allow, who'd allow a face 2 be as soft as a flower (Oh yeah) 
(Beautiful)
I could bow and feel proud in the light of this power
Oh Yeah (Beautiful)
Could U be
The Most Beautiful Girl in the World (Beautiful)
It's plain 2 see
U're the reason that God made a girl (Beautiful)
Oh yes U are
(Beautiful)
(Beautiful)
Beautiful Beautiful
Beautiful Beautiful

Beautiful Beautiful

Beautiful
And when the stars fall one by one from the sky
I know Mars could not be 2 far behind
'cause baby, this kind of beauty has got no reason 2 ever be shy
'cause honey this kind of beauty is the kind that comes from inside
Could U be (Could U be) 
The Most Beautiful Girl in the World
So beautiful, beautiful (Beautiful)
It's plain 2 see (It's plain 2 see)
U're the reason that God made a girl (Beautiful) (Ooh yeah yeah yeah yeah)
Could U be
The Most Beautiful Girl in the World
Surely baby, U must be (Beautiful)
Plain 2 see (Plain 2 see)
U're the reason that God made a girl
U're the reason (Beautiful)
Could U be
Beautiful Beautiful
