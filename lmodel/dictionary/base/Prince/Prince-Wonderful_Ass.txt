<song artist="Prince" title="Wonderful_Ass">
I'm talkin' about that ass
(2 sexy in here, yeah)
(The Revolution will be heard!) {x2}
U're so wonderful {x4}
U've got a wonderful ass
U don't understand my quirky ways
Girl, U've got a wonderful ass
U do not understand my quirky ways
My crazy logic leaves U in a daze
U think my neurosis is just a phase
Girl, U've got a wonderful ass
U're so wonderful, wonderful
U're so wonderful (U've got a wonderful ass)
U think that all my friends are my bedmates
True love before sex U just can't relate
My sensibilities U aggravate
U've got a wonderful ass
U're so wonderful, wonderful
U're so wonderful (U've got a wonderful ass)
Listen..
Educate, tolerate, negotiate, communicate
Litigate, graduate, appreciate, separate
Interrogate, violate, fluctuate, perpetrate
Masturbate, stimulate, stimulate, stimulate...
U say that U love me, it don't do no good
U want me 2 trust U, I wish that I could
U cannot build a house with plastic wood
U've got a wonderful ass
U're so wonderful, wonderful
U've got a wonderful ass
U're so wonderful, oh, wonderful (Won-der-ful)
U've got a wonderful, wonderful ass
(That sure is wonderful, she's wonderful)
U've got a wonderful ass
I guess what it is is that I hate your ideas of fun (Oh yeah?)
But baby I rate your ass number one
I don't usually have time 2 drink from your glass
But I can always find time 4 your ass
U know what I'm talkin' about baby?
(Yeah)
I'm talkin about that... ass
(2 sexy in here, yeah)
(The Revolution will be heard!) {x2}
U're so wonderful {x4}
U've got a wonderful ass (U've got a wonderful ass)
U do not understand my quirky ways
Girl, U've got a wonderful
U've got a wonderful
U've got a wonderful, wonderful ass
U don't understand my quirky ways, yeah
(U don't understand my quirky ways, but..)
My crazy logic leaves U in a daze
(U're in a daze, oh I like that ass)
But U've got that wonderful ass
Baby, U think all my friends are my bedmates, yeah
(Well, U sleep around all the time)
Hey now baby, true love before sex U can't relate, yeah (True true love)
But U've got that wonderful ass, babe
My sensibilities U aggravate (I understand)
(U try 2 fuck 4 love)
U, why can't, can't U relate, yeah
U've got a wonderful ass
I like it (I like it)
I said I like it (Said I like it)
Wonderful
U know I like that ass (Really?)
