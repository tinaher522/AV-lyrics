<song artist="Prince" title="Melody_Cool">
I've seen a many bridges in my time and crossed every one of 'em
with no trouble at all (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I had trials and tribulations, heartaches and pains (well that's alright)
Survived 'em all baby (uh huh, say it, say it!)
Hmph, I'm still Melody, and I'm still Cool
Melody Cool...
They call me Melody Cool (Melody, Melody)
I was here long before U (Melody, Melody)
If U're good I will love ya, (Melody) but I'm nobody's fool (Melody)
I'm Melody Cool
When I was born there were tidal waves (Melody, Melody)
whole town went under nobody saved (Melody, Melody)
At every funeral it rained every time I sang
Melody Cool
I have been here much longer, (Melody) longer than U (Melody)
I'm Melody Cool
well now, everybody runnin' 'round talkin' 'bout saving souls
when they know good and plenty well they got enough trouble 
trying to save their own
(alright, say it, say it girl)
(Melody...Melody...Melody)
Go on, go on.
every woman and every man (Melody)
one day they just got to understand (Melody)
that if we play in the same key everything will be
Melody Cool
(Melody, Melody, Melody, Melody)
what's your name? (Melody, Melody)
new power wave your hand, everybody sing out across the land
say hey hey hey (hey hey hey)
say hey hey hey (hey hey hey)
everybody say hey hey hey (hey hey hey)
they call me Melody Cool (Melody, Melody, Melody)
looka here young un
let me give U a piece of good advice, (Melody)
and I do get paid for counseling
it ain't no big I's and little U's in my life
so that's why U see they call me Melody Cool (Melody, Melody Cool, Melody)
I was here long before U (Melody, long before u)
if U're good (Melody) i will love U but I'm nobody's fool (Melody)
I'm Melody Cool
(Melody, Melody Cool, Melody... long before U)
