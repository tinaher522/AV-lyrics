<song artist="Prince" title="Things_Have_Got_To_Change">
Get on top, you will cop, oh
Cream
The time is now, take the chance
Get on top, you will cop, winner takes all
As we dance to the rhythm of the cream beat
Never will you see me drowning in pool of self-pity
So, as a I ooze with the flow, here we go
And if you gimme an end, so take a little mo'
The army of the brothers shall overcome
Bring in a crash from the drums, ho
Things have gotta change
Get on top, you will cop, ho
Hey, everybody, things have gotta change
(Cream)
Get on top, U will cop, ho
(Boogie)
Although the times have changed
Some things remain
I say love thy neighbor
And I'll gangk him if he ain't got no game
The rules of design read double standards
And if you're weak in the game
That's somethin' that you'll die for
(Die for)
Yeah, come on
Get on top, you will cop, ho
Everybody, things have gotta change
(Cream)
Get on top, you will cop, ho
(Boogie)
Like M.L.K. of yesterday, who died to keep a dream alive
Funny but it seems like he died in vain
'Cuz as I look around I see we ain't learned shit
And if the words are sticking, then hit me with it
'Cuz you've gotta be true to yourself
Do the best you can with the hand you've been dealt
You see, I wouldn't have it any other way
'Cuz it's part of the game we play
Come on
(Cream)
Yeah, things have gotta change
Get on top, you will cop, ho
(Boogie)
Everybody, things have gotta change
(Cream)
Yeah, get on top
(Boogie)
The army of the brothers shall overcome
And never succumb to the humdrum
Saving to keep the person's brain numb
Free your mind and your ass will follow
You've got to stand strong and never cow tow
To a sucker with a closed mind
Walkin' the thin line
Still livin' the days of the breadline
Since this is the 90's, reach a little higher
NPG, take it to the wire
(Cream)
Yeah, things have gotta change
Come along, get on top, you will cop, ho
(Boogie)
Everybody, things have gotta change
(Cream)
Yeah, get on top, you will cop, ho
(Boogie)
Is today just another replay of yesterday?
A country in disarray, discrimination a mainstay
I'm not naive, that's why I contemplate
If that's truly the faith, then there's no time to waste
So let's get ready to go the length, on the strength
We're prospering together as one in this environment
(Cream)
Yeah, come on, things have gotta change
Yeah, get on top, you will cop, ho
(Boogie)
Everybody, things have gotta change
(Cream)
Yeah, get on top, you will cop, ho
(Boogie, cream, boogie, cream, boogie)
Everybody, things have gotta change
(Cream)
Get on top, you will cop, ho
Everybody, things have gotta change
(Cream)
Get on top, you will cop, ho
(Boogie)
Everybody, things have gotta change
(Cream)
Get on top, you will cop, ho
