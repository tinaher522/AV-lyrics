Ahhh Yea!
Drop it now
Don't stop it now
Go and get it now
Here he comes again
He's gonna try and ruin my day
Never had a reason to dog me out
Don't ever make em do what they say
9 times out of 10
I ask him if he did he say no
I'll never be a turn coat never be the one
To sell your name at the grocery store
You come around funny stuff be going down
Ask him how it happend yo he don't know
But I don't care what people may say
I ain't gonna let it ruin my day
The rest rather die for a basket full of lies it's funk
It's smellin' like funky music
Stomping on my day
Gotta give me some of that music
Here she comes again
She got to tell the story her way
What she call the fellas doing something she don't wanna
Taken money where crime don't pay
Every now and then
A girl there's something somebody said
One mans justice is another mans fears
Don't you wish that you could sleep in my bed?
The only reason to say my name is to get
Your 50 sex of fame nobody's even sure what you do
But I don't care what people may say
I ain't gonna let it ruin my day
The rest rather die for a basket full of lies it's funk
It's smellin' like funky music
Let the music play
I'm crazy for coco rock
How you gonna captain B'gone
I hate to lecture nobody's home
You may not like the taste but I'm still gonna stick your face in this funk
Stick your face in it
God said we can ho hum listen to my drum
Digital music disappears
Very scary your face
Listen to my bass
Time will tell who we are
Listen to my guitar
