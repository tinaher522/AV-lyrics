<song artist="Prince" title="Everywhere">
There's a place I want to go
Where the milk and honey flow
Without God It wasn't there
Now I feel It everywhere
(feel it
Can't you feel it?)
When I was lost and couln'd see my way
I use to follow what everybody say
Now I know that's written in the heart
Now I'm ready ready to start
Without God It wasn't there
Now I feel It everywhere
We were always meant 2 b
In paradise eternally
Before the truth I did not care
Now I feel it everywhere
(feel it feel it
everywhere
feel it feel it)
Can you feel it? feel
This mighty good feeling everywhere
Oh... we got so much work 2 do everywhere
ah ah ah ah ah yeah hee yeah
