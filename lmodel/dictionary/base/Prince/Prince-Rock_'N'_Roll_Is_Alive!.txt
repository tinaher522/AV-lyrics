<song artist="Prince" title="Rock_'N'_Roll_Is_Alive!">
(Rock 'n' roll is alive!)
Rock 'n' roll is alive!
(Rock 'n' roll is alive!)
Rock 'n' roll is alive and it lives in Minneapolis
Rock 'n' roll is alive and it lives in Minneapolis
From all over the world the people came
Even the President flies in to worship a thing called fame
Red, white, and blue boy, girls, tonight everyone's the same
Some people say it's dyin', but we don't wanna play that game
Rock 'n' roll is alive and it lives in Minneapolis
(Sing)
Rock 'n' roll is alive!
(And it lives in Minneapolis)
Rock 'n' roll is alive and it lives in Minneapolis
(Sing)
Rock 'n' roll is alive!
(And it lives in Minneapolis)
Sure as the drive around Lake of the Isles is cool I know
(Oh)
Rock 'n' roll will never die like the Minne, haha flow
(Oh)
Sure as the land of a thousand lakes is sometimes made of snow
There'll always be another king 2 die butt-naked on the floor
(Oh)
Rock 'n' roll is alive and it lives in Minneapolis
(Sing)
Rock 'n' roll is alive!
(And it lives in Minneapolis)
(Oh)
Rock, rock
(Very impressive)
Rock, rock
(Sing)
Rock 'n' roll is alive and it lives in Minneapolis
Sing damn it
Rock, rock
Rock 'n' roll is alive!
(Yeah)
(Rock 'n' roll is alive and it lives in Minneapolis)
(Rock 'n' roll is alive and it lives in Minneapolis)
(Rock 'n' roll is alive and it lives in Minneapolis)
(Rock 'n' roll is alive and it lives in Minneapolis)
Rock 'n' roll is alive and it lives in Minneapolis
Rock 'n' roll is alive and it lives in Minneapolis
Rock 'n' roll is alive and it lives in Minneapolis
Rock 'n' roll is alive and it lives in Minneapolis
