<song artist="Prince" title="Come_On">
Like dat?  We can do this all night.
I know U got a young man
U don't care about me
He's darker than quicksand
He's taller than a tree
What U need is some real lovin'
'Stead of these young ass fools
I got the butter 4 u're muffin
Just need the keys 2 the room
Come on baby (shake it now)
Come on shake it now (come on baby)
Come on baby (shake it now)
Come on shake it now (come on baby)
Come on baby (shake it now)
Come on shake it now (come on baby)
Come on baby (shake it now) 
Come on shake it now
We could freeze in London
U could hear me sing (hear me sing)
And if U wanna make love then
U got 2 wear my ring (C'mon)
'Cuz I don't want no mistress
I'd much rather be bound 
Let's find a Preacher
So we can get down, down, down
Come on baby (shake it now)
Come on shake it now (come on baby)
Come on baby (shake it now)
Come on shake it now (come on baby)
Come on baby (shake it now)
Come on shake it now (come on baby)
Come on baby (shake it now) 
Come on shake it now (Come on)
Ha. U and u're girlfriend, ya'll 2 of a kind
Just runnin' these knuckleheads
3 and 4 at a time
Both of U's want babies
But u're still actin' wild
The first rule in makin' one
U can't be no child
'Stead of hittin' that remy (hittin' that remy)
Why don't ya'll hit the door (hit the door)
I'll book us on the Red Eye, we'll be good 2 go (good 2 go)
And if every life has got a reason, U can be mine
Perfume in the bath darlin'
Champagne, while we dine
Come on baby (shake it now)
Come on shake it now (come on baby)
Come on baby (shake it now)
Come on shake it now (come on baby)
Come on baby (shake it now)
Come on shake it now (come on)
Come on baby (shake it, shake it baby) 
Come on shake it now (Ohh - Come on)
Come on Baby
Yeah.  Come on.
20 days in London
U ain't give me no love
Could it be another brother man
That U're thinkin' of?
Or could it be u're girlfriend?
Who never, ever been straight
When I ask U R U hungry... (hungry)
U say U already ate. 
Now. U can play me if U wanna 
But U better let me know (let me know baby)
I don't need 2 play the good licks if there ain't gonna be no show
I'm better off sleepin' with my guitar
If U ain't gonna sing
Strapped 2 the body.... makin' love 2 the strings.
Ohhh. Oh, oh, oh 
Yeah Baby
Ohhh. Oh, oh, oh
Come on baby.  Come on shake it now. (4x)
Gimme, gimme, gimme good lovin'
'Stead of talkin' 'bout me man (come on)
If we ain't gonna make love
Can't do nothin' 4 me, 4 me 
Gimme, gimme, gimme good lovin' 
Can't do nothin' 4 me baby.
Come on baby, come on shake it now (3x)
Come on baby, I got the butter 4 u're muffin
