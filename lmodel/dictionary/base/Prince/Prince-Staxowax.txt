Girl, oh girl (Girl)
Girl, oh girl
Ooh baby baby ooh baby (Oh)
Ooh baby baby ooh baby (Oh)
Could U be (Like he said U're a sexy mother)
The Most Beautiful Girl in the World (Like he said U're a sexy mother)
{Could U be}
It's plain 2 see (Like he said U're a sexy mother)
U're the reason that God made a girl (Like he said U're a sexy mother)
Oh yes U are
When the day turns into the last day of all time
I can say, I hope that U are in these arms of mine
Oh yes
And when the night falls before that day I will cry
I will cry tears of joy cause after U all one can do is die
Oh yeah
Ooh baby baby ooh baby
Could U be (Like he said U're a sexy mother)
The Most Beautiful Girl in the World (Like he said U're a sexy mother)
It's plain 2 see (Like he said U're a sexy mother)
U're the reason that God made a girl (Like he said U're a sexy mother)
Oh yes U are
How can I get through days when I can't get through hours
I can try but when I do I see U and I'm devoured (Oh yes I am)
Who'd allow, who'd allow a face 2 be as soft as a flower
I could bow and feel proud in the light of this power (Ooh U got it)
Ooh baby baby ooh baby
Could U be (Like he said U're a sexy mother)
The Most Beautiful Girl in the World (Like he said U're a sexy mother)
{Could U be}
It's plain 2 see (Like he said U're a sexy mother)
U're the reason that God made a girl (Like he said U're a sexy mother)
Oh yes U are
And when the stars fall one by one from the sky
I know Mars could not be 2 far behind
Cuz baby, this kind of beauty has got no reason 2 ever be shy
Cuz honey, this kind of beauty is the kind that comes from inside
Ooh baby baby ooh baby
Could U be
The Most Beautiful Girl in the World
Beautiful, Beautiful
It's plain 2 see
U're the reason that God made a girl (Ooh baby, Ooo baby)
Ooh baby, Could U be (Like he said U're a sexy mother)
The Most Beautiful Girl in the World (Like he said U're a sexy mother)
Oh, I wanna know, I wanna know
It's plain 2 see (Like he said U're a sexy mother)
U're the reason that God made a girl (Like he said U're a sexy mother)
U're the reason, oh yes U are
If the stars (Like he said U're a sexy mother)
(Could U be)
Ever fell one by one from the sky (The Most Beautiful Girl in the World)
(Like he said U're a sexy mother)
Oh yes
I know Mars (Like he said U're a sexy mother)
(It's plain 2 see)
Could not be 2 far behind (U're the reason that God made a girl)
(Like he said U're a sexy mother)
Could U be (Like he said U're a sexy mother)
The Most Beautiful Girl in the World (Like he said U're a sexy mother)
Beautiful, Beautiful
Could U be (Like he said U're a sexy mother)
(Ooh baby baby ooh baby)
The Most Beautiful Girl in the World (Like he said U're a sexy mother)
Could U be (Like he said U're a sexy mother)
The Most Beautiful Girl in the World (Like he said U're a sexy mother)
Like he said U're a sexy mother (Oh)
Like he said U're a sexy mother (Oh)
Ooh baby baby ooh baby (Oh)
Like he said U're a sexy mother (Oh)
