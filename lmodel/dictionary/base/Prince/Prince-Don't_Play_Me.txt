<song artist="Prince" title="Don't_Play_Me">
Don't play me
I'm over 30 &amp; I don't smoke weed
I put my ass away &amp; music I've played
aint the type of stereo U're tryin to feed
Don't play me
Don't play me
I use proper English &amp; I'm straight
I'm in the news again for paying dues my friend
And not the type of ganda U prop in my way
Don't play me
Don't play me
I've been to the mountain top &amp; it aint what U say
Don't play me
Don't play me
I'm the wrong color &amp; I play guitar
My only competition is well in the past
Time &amp; time if time existed movin ever so fast
Don't play me
U couldn't play enough of me now
2 make me feel like a star
Don't play me I already do in my car 
Don't play me
Don't be mad at me
The curtain puller in the game
Maybe how U call us Niggers aint the same
It's all good when u know the only fame
Is the light that comes from God &amp; the joy U get to say his name
Don't play me
Don't play me
I've seen to the mountain top &amp; it aint what U say
Don't play me
Already got laid
