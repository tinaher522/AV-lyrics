<song artist="Prince" title="Man'oWar_(Remix)">
Why you screamin'?
You know I'm not a man'o'war
Break the gold chain that I gave you
Throw it down on the floor
Instead of this 7 page letter
I wish I had peace of mind
My friends tell me, "You should go get her"
But lovin' you, lovin' you, lovin' you is a waste of time
(Waste of time)
Ah, yes it is, it's a waste of time, ooh
Look at me
I need to get out of this city
I need to get you outta my head
I need to get away from the words that you said to me
Why you screamin'?
You know I'm not a man'o'war
What makes you think that I could put something inside of someone
That I put inside of you?
Even if I tried to, if I tried to (Tried to, tried to)
I couldn't 'cause I still smell like the last time that we...
Lovin' you, lovin' you, lovin' you is a waste of time 
(Is a waste of time)
Oh, yes it is
Is a waste of time, baby
Ooh
I need to feel wanted again (Wanted again)
I need to feel love is alive, yeah (Love is alive, is alive)
I need to hear you say that you ain't lookin' for another reason 
To make me cry
Why you screamin'? (Ooh uh)(Why?)
You know I'm not a man'o'war
I've been tryin' to make you happy, baby
Ever since we were sophomores
But lovin' you, lovin' you, lovin' you is a waste of time
Oh, yes it is (Is a waste of time)
Ooh, it's a waste of time, waste of time, waste of time
(If there is no future)
If there is no future
(Then there is no past)
Then there is no past
(All we've got is right now)
All we've got is right now
Let's make it last
Why you screamin'?
(Can we make it last?)
You know I'm not a man'o'war
Break the gold chain that I gave you
Throw it down on the floor (Oh, throw it down)
Instead of this 7 page letter
I wish I had peace of mind
My friends tell me, they tell me, "You should go get her"
(That's what they tell me)
But lovin' you, lovin' you, lovin' you is a waste of time
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I need to get out of this city
I need to get you outta my head
I need to
How did Lenny say: I got to get away, I got to get away
Away from the words you said to me
Tryin' to take away my dignity
Peace of mind is where I should be
Instead of this 7 page letter, see
If you wanna serve me a plate of blues
I won't buy you no more shoes
Donatella lace you in dresses, still
I gets no love, but I pay the bills
I will, I will pay the bills
100,000 dollars and some change...
I've been trying to make you happy, baby
But lovin' you, lovin' you, lovin' you
Is a waste of time
Why you screamin'?
You know I'm not a man'o'war
Break the gold chain that I gave you
Throw it down on the floor, on the floor
Instead of this 7 page letter
I wish I had peace of mind
My friends tell me "You should go get her"
But lovin' you, lovin' you, lovin' you is a waste of time
