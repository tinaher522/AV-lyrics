Why? 
I got the news just yesterday
They said u up and ran away
All because of what somebody said
I spent my wedding night alone in bed
'cause u left me standing at the altar
U left big tears in my eyes (tears in my eyes)
U didn't even stop 2 ask me who, what or where or why
Ever since the day that we first met
Everybody been jealous as they could get (they could get)
People sayin' this and sayin' that (sayin' that)
Struck us, struck us out before we even got 2 bat
Hey, u left me standing at the altar
U left big tears in my eyes (tears in my eyes)
U didn't even stop 2 ask me who, what or where or why
How could u do this, how could u leave? 
When u knew how much u meant 2 me (u meant 2 me)
I gave 2 u more than I've given any friend
Just 2 have u give it all back in the end

U left my poor heart broken
U left my world in a daze (in a daze)
If I could, I'd write a letter 2 u
But I don't know what 2 say, I don't know what 2 say
I got the news just yesterday
They said u up and ran away
If there's a God way up above
One day u'll have 2 answer 2 him 4 my love
U left me standing at the altar
U left big tears in my eyes
U didn't even stop 2 ask me who, what or where or why
U left my poor heart broken
U left my world in a daze (in a daze)
If I could, I'd write a letter 2 u
But I don't know what 2 say, I don't know what 2 say
(u left me standing at the altar)
U better stop doggin' me baby, yeah
I can't take it no more
I can't take it no more, baby
(u left my poor heart broken)
