<song artist="Prince" title="The_Screams_Of_Passion">
Whoa no, whoa yeah (Woo, oh) 
Whoa no, whoa no, yeah yeah, yeah yeah 
There's a gentle autumn breeze that blows 
Whenever we be lyin', lyin' in my bed 
The moon appears and disappears, U look at me 
My clothes I quickly, I quickly shed 
The curtains dance a minuet, autumn plays the music, baby 
Come on, hold my hand 
Leaves are fallin' velvet splash 
Only U and I can under, only U can understand 
The sunlight draws a picture through the silky lace 
That hangs above your, hangs above your door 
A picture that is waving, that it seems 2 be with every thrust U 
Make me beg 4 more 
Oh, a robin sings a masterpiece 
That lives and dies unheard 
4 screams of passion 
A sound produced by 2 in love 
Curtains dance and autumn plays on 
(Oh, 2 in love, on and on) 
The screams of passion 
All I hear in my head echoing like a volcano, baby 
The screams of passion 
Back and forth the raging seas of lust, I want U madly 
Can't U tell, can't U tell, can't U tell, can't U tell? 
Oww! 
Take me in your arms, oh baby 
The crime is done, I'd rather die here in your 
Screams of passion 
Whoa, hold me now, baby 
Tell me that U love me 
Is it Sunday or is it passion? 

Love, love (The screams of passion) 
The screams of passion, yeah yeah, love 
The screams of, the screams of, the screams of passion, passion 
Hand me that love 
Yeah! (Shhh... not so loud baby) 
Yeah! (Shhh, shhh) 
The screams of passion {x2} 
Oh, oh, oh, the screams of passion 
Ooh, the screams of, the screams of, the screams of passion 
The screams of passion 
Back and forth the raging seas of lust 
Raging, raging (The screams of passion) 
U know I want U madly baby 
Why can't U tell? Oww 
Is.. is it Sunday? (Ooh love, ooh love) 
I thought I heard a church bell (Or was it passion, passion?) 
Yeah yeah (Oooh) 
Passion 
The screams of passion 
What did U say baby? 
Excuse me, but ... 
Is that your passion? 
Do U want my passion? 
Uh, do U want my passion? 
If U want my love, if U want my body baby 
Let me hear ya, let me hear ya, let, uh, let me hear ya scream! 
I want some passion 
Ooooh 
U know what I'm talkin' about baby? 
Ooooh 
I want some passion 
U got that baby? 
I want some passion 
Passion, mmm
