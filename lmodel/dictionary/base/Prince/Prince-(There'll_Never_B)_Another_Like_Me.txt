<song artist="Prince" title="(There'll_Never_B)_Another_Like_Me">
It really don't matter who you get with
'Cause it just ain't meant to be
It really don't matter
'Cause you never shoulda woulda,
Even coulda been like me
I can get you what you want anything
At all girl all you gotta say is please
Ask your mother your sister your brotha
There'll never be another
Never be another like me
Late afternoon slipped outta my bed
Turned up the stereo
About to raise the dead
Slipped in the bathroom
Put some olive oil in my hair
Walked in the closet
Tryin' to find something to wear
Then I check my email
To see where the party be
Change the names to protect the guilty
And get ready to creep
Should I bring somebody
Or dance alone?
It don't matter to me you'all
'Cause tonight is on
I can get you what you want anything
At all girl all you gotta say is please
Ask your mother your sister your brotha
There'll never be another
Never be another like me
Bout a half past ten and I'm on my way
Heard you had a fine little Puerto Rican DJ
If she ain't got Prince's new song
There is gonna be a scene
'Cause I can't stand nobody cussin'
At me when I'm clean
Arms all around me
Soon as eye hit the door
Good thing I ate my spinach
You're thicker than before
Oh what's this boy doing
You he makin' that face
Don't he know I have crazy friends with me
Ready to tear up this place?
I can get you what you want anything
At all girl all you gotta say is please
Ask your mother your sister your brotha
There'll never be another
Never be another like me
Can't you see this is inevitable
What's the use in wastin' time?
You and me we could be comfortable
All that takes is for you to make up your mind
So now what's the matter?
You and me, we both dimes
Said we were
All them other pennies should scatter
We ought not waste this time
That's you...
I can get you what you want anything
At all girl all you gotta say is please
Ask your mother your sister your brotha
There'll never be another
Never be another like me
