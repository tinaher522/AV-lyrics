<song artist="Prince" title="The_Daisy_Chain">
Oww!
Scream one more time
Scream, scream one more time
I bet U cant--
Oww! 
Bless my soul, save my name
I ain't never goin' down 2 the daisy chain! 
Just a young man tryin' 2 feel the flow
(Flow, flow, flow) 
Had no idea what the chain is for
(No idea, No idea) 
The nashing of the teeth &amp; bloodshed thighs
(Yeah, yeah)
Cop a teeny whiplashed, but still he tries 
Bless my soul, save my name
I ain't never going down 2 the daisy chain! 
Black girl givin' it up
White girl givin' it up
Black girl givin' it up
White girl givin' it up 
Tell me now what's on the stereo
Funky like a junkie with corn rows 
That's why your behind's so narrow
(So narrow) 
Switchen numbers with the video
Leave ya with a headache, no more fame 
I ain't never going down U the daisy chain! 
Black girl givin' it up
White girl givin' it up
Black girl givin' it up
White girl givin' it up 
Girls gonna keep on givin' it up
A mouse to the trap, the cheese is up 
A little bit of pleasure 4 the guilty pain
Think about it sister, now U're livin' in shame... 
Gots no hips 2 vibrate
(Mm mm)
That's why U gets no page
Everyone of y'all suspect 
I takes no blame 
(takes no blame)
I writes no cheques 
(no cheques) 
I ain't never going down 2 the daisy chain!
I ain't never going down 2 the daisy chain!(repeat) 
(Black girl givin' it up)
(White girl givin' it up)(repeat x 2) 
Ahoo, ooh ooh ooh
Ahoo, ooh ohh ooh
(Daisy chain) 
Ahoo, ooh ohh ooh
(Givin' it up)
Ahoo, ooh ohh ohh 
I knew a dancer, her name was Kelly
Nickname Candy with a hoop through her belly 
A tongue ring with a voice 2 sing
With a body like whooo, dime peace, everything 
See I used 2 deliver pizza 2 her house
But tonight she said, "Yo, Come in and chill out" 
I came in, sat down, I was lookin' around
What I found, I found she was steppin' out a gown 
I had 2 stop that girl in her tracks
I said let me tell U something by a guy that raps 
Yo, why buy U if he can just lease U
Why iron you if he can just crease U 
Why try you if he won't breed U
Why drive through if he won't eat U
Why V.I.P. you if he can nose bleed U
Ok, stop cryin'
I'm sorry, I'll leave U
Daisy chain
Daisy chain
Daisy chain
Daisy chain
Daisy chain 
Make your hip vibrate {7X}
Daisy chain
Leave you with a headache, daisy chain 
Daisy chain
I aint never, never, ever goin' down 2 the daisy chain
(Laughter to fade)
