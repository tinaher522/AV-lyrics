Hey sugar
Come here
I got something 2 lay on your mind
I'm gonna build a big tall wall
Stone circle so U can't get out
Big tall wall
True love is what it's all about
If I see U in a restaurant
Ooh, baby, U're all I want
Your sexy body, your curly brown hair
Try 2 run if U want 2, I don't care!
I'm gonna build a big tall wall
Stone circle so U can't get out
Big tall wall (Sugar darling)
True love is what it's all about
If I see U walkin' down the street
(See U walkin' down the street)
U be the one I wanna meet (U be the one I wanna meet)
U dress so smart (U dress so smart)
U talk so neat (U talk so neat)
U are so fine (So fine)
It's hard not 2 eat'cha, baby!
Big tall wall
Stone circle so U can't get out
I'm gonna build a big tall wall (Oh yeah, ooh)
True love is what it's all about
B is 4 bold, girl that's how U make me feel
I is 4 ignorant, this situation's real (So real)
G is 4 my girlfriend, yah U know
I got another one (G is 4 my girlfriend)
But that ain't gonna stop me and U
From having fun (Stop me, stop me)
Big tall wall
I see U in a restaurant
I don't want nothing else
U're all I want (U're all I want)
Big tall wall
Baby, I'd kiss U 4 Uncle Sam
Pretty little baby, U're so glam
Every time I see U I wanna slam
Big tall wall
Stone circle so U can't get out, get out (U can't get out)
Big tall wall (Yeah, yes I am)
True love, true love is what it's all about
Big (Ooh) tall wall
B is 4 bold, that's how U make me feel
Ooh, big tall, big tall wall
(Don't leave me like this, that's so cold)
Your sexy body, your curly brown hair
Ooh, pretty baby U really take me there
Baby doll, U're so glam
Every time I see U I wanna slam (Ow, uh!)
If I see U in a restaurant (I don't want nothing else)
Oh baby, baby, U're all I want (U're all I want)
Sexy body, your curly brown hair (Girl, girl, girl, girl)
U really take me there (Yeah!)
I'm gonna build a big tall wall
Stone circle so U can't get out
(Build a big tall wall
(I'm gonna build a...)
(Ooh, I'm gonna build a...)
True love is what it's all about
I'm gonna build a big tall wall (Tall wall, tall wall, tall, baby, sugar)
Stone circle so U can't get out (Get out)
Big tall wall (I'm gonna, I'm gonna, yeah)

Stone circle so U can't get out
True love is what it's all about

Baby doll, U're so glam
Every time I see U I wanna slam
U have the nerve 2 walk up my street

My modus operandi left a lot 2 be desired?
I got more holes than a golf course
Oh yeah, U're hot company

Honey, (little bitch), U're so mean
Every time I see U I wanna sc-sc-sc-sc-scream

U're just my style girl (Tall wall)
U wanna see my... (Tall wall)

U wanna see my bridge? (I just wanna eat'cha, honey)
Well what'cha want, what'cha wanna see? (B is 4 bold, baby)
