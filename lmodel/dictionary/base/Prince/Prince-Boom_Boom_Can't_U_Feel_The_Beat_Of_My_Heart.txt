<song artist="Prince" title="Boom_Boom_Can't_U_Feel_The_Beat_Of_My_Heart">
Can't U feel the pumpin', baby?
Boom boom, pumpin', baby
Can't U feel the beat of my heart?
B-b-b-boom boom {x2}
B-boom boom {x3}
Come a little closer, baby
Put your hand on my chest
Feel the beat of my heart pumping through my dress
Something's on fire, baby
It's burning me up
Desire, it must be cuz your body's 2 much
CHORUS:
Can't U feel the beat of my heart?
Boom boom
Can't U feel the beat just a pumpin' 4 U?
Come a little closer, baby
I promise not 2 bite
U could tie me down, I wouldn't put up a fight
U can tear my clothes off
Cut my brand new dress
Something tells me U just might be the best
CHORUS
Boom boom
Can't U feel the pumpin', baby?
Boom boom, pumpin', baby
Can't U feel the beat of my heart?
Can't U feel the pumpin', baby?
Boom boom, pumpin', baby
Can't U feel the beat of my heart?
Come a little closer, baby
Put your hand on my chest
Feel the beat of my heart pumping through my dress
Something's on fire, baby
It's burning me up (It's burning me up)
Desire, it must be cuz your body's 2 much
CHORUS {x3}
(Boom boom)
(Just a pumpin' baby, baby, just a pumpin' baby) {x2}
Can't U feel it? {x3}
Can't U feel the beat of my heart?
B-b-boom boom
Can U... hehe... my heart... boom... hehe
