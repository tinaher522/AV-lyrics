<song artist="Prince" title="Push_It_Up">
(push it up! push it up!)
Put your hands up ¨c come on (push it up!)
Huh ¨c yeah, this is it, this is it (push it up!)
This is it
I think they got 2 get ready 4 this one here ¨c come on!
(ooh, everybody's here) say what? 
(this is the jam of the year)
Huh, what did I hear? (push it up! push it up!)
Uh, wasn't quite clear
(ooh, everybody's here) say what? 
(this is the jam of the year)
Oh, huh - I hear ya, huh (push it up! push it up!)
Come on, uh
If u're ever down draggin' on the ground
Face twisted with a funky frown
Let me turn u on 2 somethin' that I found
2 make u feel good, feel good
Negativity like gravity
Gotcha fallin' fast from reality
U gotta get up, put up, move up
And just do what u should, u should
Realize that u are somebody
Come on, y'all, and join the party
Everybody grab a body
And feel good, u should¡­
Chorus:
Push it up - push it up - push it up - push it up
(ooh, everybody's here - this is the jam of the year)
(push it up! push it up!)
Push it up - push it up - push it up - push it up
(ooh, everybody's here - this is the jam of the year)
(push it up! push it up!)
Push it up, push it up 2 the sky
U don't have 2 have a plane 2 fly
If u listen 2 the truth and not the lie
Stop cryin', cryin'

In harmony, can't u see
Every color all in the same key
And that's the way jah wants us 2 be
Start tryin', a-tryin'
Realize that u are somebody
Come on, y'all, and join the party
Everybody grab a body
And feel good, u should¡­
Chorus
Come on - wake up your body, wake up your body
Wake up your body and move it around ¨c come on
Yeah, huh
Where the party at in here, y'all? 
Where the party goin' down in here? uh
Now I wanna know who's ready 2 show me
Get on down with the one and only party ambassador
Flip styles like a spatula mac-tacula
More legend than a new acura
Body tone stone while I rap 2 her
Capture her thinkin' I'm a mac 2 her
Just because I'm attracted 2 her
But the fact of the matter is the dance floor's phatter
The crowd's on fire as we push it up higher
Push it up! - come on, y'all
Push it up! - put your hands in the air
Push it up! - come on, y'all
Push it up! - while the artist turn it up, come - uh!
Yeah, huh
Break it on down (push it, push it up!)
Huh
This is the jam, this is the jam, this is the jam of the year {x2}
Push it up {x12}
Everybody grab a body, everybody push it up {x2}
On and on till the early morn' - push it up
Push it up {x7}
