<song artist="Prince" title="Crazy_You">
You got a strange way about cha...
Kinda crazy, but I love you just the same...
'Cause you... oh, you make me wanna do 
Oh, everything...
I'm just a crazy fool, lost in the world of love I get from crazy you...
Oh, I'm so strung out thinking 'bout the crazy things you do;
Crazy you...
