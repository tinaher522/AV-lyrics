<song artist="Prince" title="It's_Gonna_Be_Lonely">
We've been together for quite some time - I'd think by now, you'd know;
It would take forever to get you off my mind, if ever you decide to go...
I guess I got a little insecurity when it's concerning you...
I guess I'm just afraid that if you ever leave, I'd be in a messed-up state of blue...
And I'd be so lonely...
Without you loving me, I know it's gonna be lonely...
Without you giving me everylittlesinglething that I need - lonely...
Whatever's in your kiss, it really turns me on 'til I go right out of my mind...
And who could ever resist your accent from gay Paree? It gets me every time...
I betcha thatcha never knew, that in my dreams, you are the star...
The only bummer is that you always want to leave - Who do you think you are?
Don't you know it's gonna be lonely?
Without you loving me, I know it's gonna be lonely...
Without you giving me everylittlesinglething that I need - Lonely...
It's gonna be lonely...
Without you loving me, giving me everything that I need;
Oh, pretty baby, can't you see? It's gonna be lonely!
Without you loving me, I know, I know it's gonna be lonely...
Oh, whatever's in your kiss, I never could resist - Oh, baby don't go!
We've been together for quite some time;
It'd take forever to get you off my mind... (Oh, girl!)
Without you loving me, I know it's gonna be lonely!
Without you by my side, don't you know that I could die, baby?
Without you loving me, can't you see it's gonna be lonely?
Oh, don't, don't go... Oh, oh, oh, oh...
It's gonna be lonely, baby, so lonely, baby...
