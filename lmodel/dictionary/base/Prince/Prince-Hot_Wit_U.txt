Hot Wit U
I wanna get hot wit U 
Get U underneath the cream and ohhh
Get U doin' things U thought u'd never do
Make U suck your tongue and say... Ohhh
I wanna get hot wit U
Take U upstairs 2 the 14th room
Multicolored lights and an ocean view
Ohh, I wanna get hot wit U
I wanna get hot wit u, I wanna get hot wit U
I wanna get hot wit u, I wanna get hot wit U
I want 2 get hot with U
I want 2 get U underneath the cream and do, the marshmallow
Ohh... I want 2 get hot with U
I wanna get U 2 do something U thought u'd never do
Like dance in front of my headlights 
On a hot summer night... nude
I want 2 get hot with U
I wanna get hot wit U 
Get U underneath the cream and ohhh
Get U doin' things U thought u'd never do
Make U suck your tongue and say... Ohhh
I wanna get hot wit U
Take U upstairs 2 the 14th room
Multicolored lights and an ocean view
Ohh, I wanna get hot wit U
I want 2 get hot with U
I wanna make U climb this chain around my waist so I can prove
That I'm the only one that brings out the freak in U
I want 2 to get hot with U
I wanna get hot wit U, I wanna get hot wit U  Huh
I wanna get hot wit U, I wanna get hot wit U
Know the body bangin' got U singing
Annoying shouts from neighbors, telephone ringing
Put me in positions thought I'd never do proper
Created a machine now U know U can't stop her
Tryin' 2 turn me out, it'll never happen, so stop this
I'm supposed to tremble cuz they call U "The Artist"?
Let's wild out -  can U handle rough ridin?
Treat u like the freak of the week and had U hiding from me
I'd do whatever U like if U can take it
If I can be u're girlfriend U can catch me naked
Can't front sexually I'd like a sample 
But I don't think that I'm ready for U 2 make me an example
I mean c'mon why front on?
I'd never place time, queen in u're life, I'm there whenever
The things that U feelin' for me - mutual
That I'm ready to call U "Daddy", even get hot with U
Meet me early morning
(Meet me early morning baby)
In a 4th dimension plane
(4th dimension plane)
Astral travelin' hottie
(Hottie, hottie)
I know U know my game
Underneath the cream I'll meet U
(I'll meet U down there)
And then we'll rearrange
(Turn the child 'round)
Everything U know of love
(Everything)
I'll give U a reason 2 change
(Hot wit U, I wanna get hot wit U - I wanna, wanna boo)
I wanna get hot wit U (I wanna get)
I want 2 get hot with U
I wanna steal a kiss in the middle of an
Overcrowded room yeah, that's what I wanna do
I, I, I, I wanna get with U, hot with U... boo
I wanna get hot wit U 
Get U underneath the cream and ohhh
Get U doin' things U thought u'd never do
Make U suck your tongue and say... Ohhh
I wanna get hot wit U
Take U upstairs 2 the 14th room
Multicolored lights and an ocean view
Ohh, I wanna get hot wit U
Take a drive 2 the ocean
And drown U in a wave 
Of a hundred thousand compliments boo
I want your everyday 2 be cool
And the only way 2 do that is every night
Get hot, Get hot with U... yeah baby
I wanna get hot wit U 
Get U underneath the cream and ohhh
Get U doin' things U thought u'd never do (never, never)
Make U suck your tongue and say... Ohhh
I wanna get hot wit U
Take U upstairs 2 the 14th room ( oh baby)
Multicolored lights and an ocean view (can't U see it)
Ohh, I wanna get hot wit U, Hot wit U 
(Yeah) I wanna get hot wit U 
Get U underneath the cream and ohhh
Get U doin' things U thought u'd never do
Make U suck your tongue and say... 
Ohhh, Ohhh, Ohhh, Ohhh
I wanna get hot wit U
