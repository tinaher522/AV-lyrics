<song artist="Prince" title="Automatic">
U ask me if I love u
It's automatic
Cuz everytime u leave me, I die
That's automatic 2
U ask me 2 4give u
When u know I'm just an addict
So stop the music, baby
U know u're all I wanna do
(Hey!)
A-U-T-O-matic
Just tell me what 2 do (oh)
A-U-T-O-matic
I'm so in love with u
U ask me if I'll kiss u
It's automatic
And if u cry, me cry, boo hoo
That's automatic 2, ooh
I would never leave u
No matter what u do
So stop the music, baby
U know I'm an automatic fool
(Hey!)
A-U-T-O-matic
Just tell me what 2 do (Until I stop)
A-U-T-O-matic
I'm so in love with u (oh ooh)
I'll rub ur back 4ever
It's automatic (A-U-T-O-matic)
I'll look 4 a needle in a haystack
It's automatic 2, ooh (A-U-T-O-matic)
I'll go down on u all night long
It's automatic (U will?)  (Yes I will, babe)
And even when I'm right, I'll be wrong
That's automatic 2 (A-U-T-O-matic)
(Hey!)
A-U-T-O-matic
Just tell me what 2 do (oh)
A-U-T-O-matic
I'm so in love with u
Tell me what 2 do, baby
Mmm
So in love with U, yeah
Tell me what 2 do, baby
So in love with U, baby yeah
Alright, alright
Tell me what 2 do, baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
(Hey!)
A-u-t-o-matic {x2}
Come on, baby
A-U-T-O-matic
Tell me what 2 do
A-U-T-O-matic
So in love with U
Don't say that no man has ever tasted your ice cream
Baby, U're the purple star of the night supreme
U'll always be a virgin
4 no man deserves your love
I only pray that when U dream
I'm the one U dream of
I pray that when U dream
U dream of how we kiss
Not with our lips, but with our souls
Stop me if I bore U
Why is it that I think we'd be so good in bed?
Can U hear me?
Why do I love U so much?
It's so strange, I'm more comfortable around U when I'm naked
Can U hear me?
I wonder if U have any mercy, don't torture me
Stop the music, baby
Automatic fool!
When it comes 2 U, I'm automatic, baby
There's no one else like me
I'm the best U'll ever find
No one else could understand U
U're 2 complex
They say nothing's perfect
But they don't know U
It's automatic 2
Can U hear me?
Honey, I'm so addicted 2 your pleasure
I'm addicted 2 your pain
It's automatic
Automatically insane
Undress me
Hey!
A-U-T-O-matic, oh no, no, no, no
A-U-T-O-matic{x2}
Hey!
Fasten your seat belts
Prepare 4 takeoff
I can dream of how U kissed me
Not with your lips, but with your soul
With U I'm never bored
Talk 2 me some more
I can hear U
I'm going 2 have 2 torture U now
