<song artist="Prince" title="Dead_On_It">
Riding in my Thunderbird on the freeway
I turned on my radio 2 hear some music play
I got a silly rapper talking silly shit instead
Sayin' the only good rapper is one that's dead on it
Uh, dead on it
Shall we go back? (Yeah!)
Let's go
Negroes from Brooklyn play the bass pretty good
But the ones from Minneapolis play it like it oughta should
A mackin' fro is better when U got a blue bonnet
And the 2 and fro is funky when the grease is dead on it
Funky dead on it
Uh, dead on it
Shall we go back?
Let's go
Funky dead on it, wow
See, the rapper's problem usually stem from being tone deaf
Pack the house then try 2 sing, there won't be no one left
On it
Parking lots on fire, brothers peelin' outta town
They say in disgust, been singin' their guts
Rappin' done let us down (down, down)
We got 2 be dead on it
Dead on it (Dead)
All the sisters like it when U lick 'em on the knees
Don't believe me? (No)
Do it once then stop
They'll be beggin' please, please, please (please, please, please)
Shoo bee doo wa, dead on it
What does that have 2 do with the funk? Nothing!
But who's payin' the bills?
If U don't wanna lick my knees
I'm sho' your mama will, uh
Cuz we, cuz we, cuz we dead on it
De..de..de..de..de..dead on it, on it
La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
My bed's a coffin, Dracula ain't got shit on me
My nickname's Hellzapoppin', I'm badder than the wicked witch
I got a gold tooth cost more than your house
I got a diamond ring on 4 fingers, each one the size of a mouse
They dead, they dead on it
(Asses is crackin') {x2}
La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la {x2}
Wait now, hang up, dial tone on the 3
U know, U know I'm busy, 2 scizzy
Can't nobody fuck with me!
Cuz I'm dead (on it, on it, on it) on it
(Shoo bee doo wa wa, dead on it)
Dead on it, on it, on it {fade out}
Dang, dang, dang, dang (Dead on it)
Shoo bee dang, dang, dang, dead on it
Dead, dead on it
