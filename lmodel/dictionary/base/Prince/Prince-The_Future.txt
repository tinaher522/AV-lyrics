<song artist="Prince" title="The_Future">
"I'm not gonna kill U
I want U 2 do me a favor
I want U 2 tell all your friends about me"
"What are U?"
"I'm Batman!"
CHORUS:
I've seen the future and it will be
I've seen the future and it works
If there's life after, we will see
So I can't go like a jerk
Systematic overthrow of the underclass
Hollywood conjures images of the past
New world needs spirituality that will last
I've seen the future and it will be
CHORUS
Yellow Smiley offers me X
Like he's drinkin' 7-Up
I would rather drink 6 razor blades
Razor blades from a paper cup
He can't understand, I say 2 tough
It's just that I've seen the future and, boy, it's rough
I... I've seen the future and it will be
I've seen the future and it works
If there's life after, we will see
So U can't go like a jerk - no, no
I've seen the future and it will be
Wait a minute
Pretty pony standin' on the avenue
Flashin' loaded pistol, 2 dumb 2 be true
Somebody told him playin' cops and robbers was cool
Would our rap have been different if we only knew?
I've seen the future and it will be
I've seen the future and it works
And if there's life after, we will see
Don't go out like a jerk
Systematic overthrow of the underclass
Hollywood conjures images of the past
New world needs spirituality that will last
I've seen the future and it will be, alright
I've seen the future and it will be {x2}
Oh!
I've seen the future and it will be {x3}
"Think about the future!"
