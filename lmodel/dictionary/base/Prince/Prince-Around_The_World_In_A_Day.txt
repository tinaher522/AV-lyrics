<song artist="Prince" title="Around_The_World_In_A_Day">
Open your heart, open your mind 
A train is leaving all day 
A wonderful trip through our time 
And laughter is all U pay 
Around the world in a day, oh!
Around the world in a day 
Now dig...
Loneliness already knows U 
There ain't no reason 2 stay 
Come here, take my hand, I'll show U 
I think I know a better way, y'all 
Around the world in a day, ow!
(Listen 2 me now) 
Around the world in a day 
All the babies sing it now 
Ooh la, la 
Ooh la, la, la, la 
No, sha, sha 
No, no shouting every day (No shouting every day) 
No shouting (No shouting)
No, no shouting
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha 
The little one will escort U 
2 places within your mind 
(The former is red, white, and blue) 
Former is red, white, and blue! 
(The latter is a purple climb) 
The latter is a purple - come on and climb! 
Around the world in a day, sugar (Oh, baby)
Around the world in a day 
Come on, say it! 
Around the world in a day 
Say papa, I think I wanna dance! 
(In summer she is sweeter) 
Around the world in a day {repeat to fade}
Oh yeah! 
All the little babies sing around the world 
A government of love and music boundless in its unifying power
A nation of art 2 production 
Sharing ideas, a shower of flowers
