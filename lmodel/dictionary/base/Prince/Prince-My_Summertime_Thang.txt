Make me feel alright
I feel good every night, yeah
Treat me like a lover would
And it feel so good (Ooh)
My summertime thang (Summertime)
Dancin' on the floor
Don't stop, let's do some more (Ahhh)
We could have a total ball
I'm happy once and 4 all
My summertime thang
Oooh ahhho
I think about U when I'm sleeping
I think about U when I'm at the mall
I think about the summer I first met U (Ooh)
Most of all I think about the time U met me (Oww!)
My summertime thang (Never lets me down)
Never lets met down
Keeps working all year round (Round and round)
This thang is my one desire (and round and round) (Ooh)
It takes me higher
