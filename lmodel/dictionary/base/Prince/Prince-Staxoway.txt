Girl, oh girl (girl)
Girl, oh girl
Ooh baby baby ooh baby (oh)
Ooh baby baby ooh baby (oh)
Could you be (like he said you're a sexy mother)
The most beautiful girl in the world (like he said you're a sexy mother)
{could you be}
It's plain to see (like he said you're a sexy mother)
You're the reason that God made a girl (like he said you're a sexy mother)
Oh yes you are
When the day turns into the last day of all time
I can say, I hope that you are in these arms of mine
Oh yes
And when the night falls before that day I will cry
I will cry tears of joy cause after you all one can do is die
Oh yeah
Ooh baby baby ooh baby
Could you be (like he said you're a sexy mother)
The most beautiful girl in the world (like he said you're a sexy mother)
It's plain to see (like he said you're a sexy mother)
You're the reason that God made a girl (like he said you're a sexy mother)
Oh yes you are
How can I get through days when I can't get through hours
I can try but when I do I see you and I'm devoured (oh yes I am)
Who'd allow, who'd allow a face to be as soft as a flower
I could bow and feel proud in the light of this power (ooh you got it)
Ooh baby baby ooh baby
Could you be (like he said you're a sexy mother)
The most beautiful girl in the world (like he said you're a sexy mother)
{could you be}
It's plain to see (like he said you're a sexy mother)
You're the reason that God made a girl (like he said you're a sexy mother)
Oh yes you are
And when the stars fall one by one from the sky
I know Mars could not be to far behind
Cuz baby, this kind of beauty has got no reason to ever be shy
Cuz honey, this kind of beauty is the kind that comes from inside
Ooh baby baby ooh baby
Could you be
The most beautiful girl in the world
Beautiful, beautiful
It's plain to see
You're the reason that God made a girl (ooh baby, ooo baby)
Ooh baby, could you be (like he said you're a sexy mother)
The most beautiful girl in the world (like he said you're a sexy mother)
Oh, I wanna know, I wanna know
It's plain yo see (like he said you're a sexy mother)
You're the reason that God made a girl (like he said you're a sexy mother)
You're the reason, oh yes you are
If the stars (like he said you're a sexy mother)
(could you be)
Ever fell one by one from the sky (the most beautiful girl in the world)
(like he said you're a sexy mother)
Oh yes
I know Mars (like he said you're a sexy mother)
(it's plain to see)
Could not be too far behind (you're the reason that God made a girl)
(like he said you're a sexy mother)
Could you be (like he said you're a sexy mother)
The most beautiful girl in the world (like he said you're a sexy mother)
Beautiful, beautiful
Could you be (like he said you're a sexy mother)
(ooh baby baby ooh baby)
The most beautiful girl in the world (like he said you're a sexy mother)
Could you be (like he said you're a sexy mother)
The most beautiful girl in the world (like he said you're a sexy mother)
Like he said you're a sexy mother (oh)
Like he said you're a sexy mother (oh)
Ooh baby baby ooh baby (oh)
Like he said you're a sexy mother (oh)
Like he said you're a sexy mother
