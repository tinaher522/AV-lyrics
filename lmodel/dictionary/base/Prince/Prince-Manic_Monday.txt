<song artist="Prince" title="Manic_Monday">
6 o'clock already, I was just in the middle of a dream
I was kissing Valentino by a crystal blue Italian stream
But I can't be late cuz then I guess I just won't get paid
These are the days when U wish your bed was already made
CHORUS:
It's just another manic Monday
I wish it was Sunday
Cuz that's my fun day
My "I don't have 2 run" day
It's just another manic Monday
Have 2 catch an early train, got 2 be 2 work by 9
If I had an airplane, I still couldn't make it on time
Cuz it takes me so long just 2 figure out what I'm gonna wear
Blame it on the train, but the boss is already there
CHORUS
All of the nights, why did my lover have 2 pick last night 2 get down?
(Last night we got down)
Doesn't it matter that I have 2 feed the both of us? Employment's down
But when he tells me in his bedroom voice
"Come on, honey, let's go make some noise," what he says
Time, it goes so fast (when U're having fun)
It's just another manic Monday
I wish it was Sunday
Cuz that's my fun day
It's just another manic Monday
