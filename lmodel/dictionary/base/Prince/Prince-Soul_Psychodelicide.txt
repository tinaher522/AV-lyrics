<song artist="Prince" title="Soul_Psychodelicide">
Can we talk about soul?
Good Judy wanna dance 2 this?
Listen Cash, I do believe?
I do believe that I wanna battle 2night
Listen Cash (Ooh)
Don't be sad, there's nothing wrong with your player
We have taken control as we bring U the new power?
CHORUS:
Soul Psychodelicide (It's a heavenly thing)
Soul Psychodelicide (It's a heavenly thing)
Soul Psychodelicide (It's a heavenly thing)
Soul Psychodelicide
The maxi-pump of power
Good Judy wanna fly the kite
The maxi-pump of sheer delight
Guaranteed 2 pump your body right
Damn skippy, we been here before
We're just comin' on harder now
Hard on this feeling
Holy steppin?on solid ground (Oh-we-oh)
Good Judy wanna hear us sing?
CHORUS
(The maxi-pump)
(U wanna try it 2night?)
All over the world there's a new soul goin' on
Brand new singer singin' a brand new song
Of an age-old story, still got 2 be told
The spirit can't be bought and it can't be sold
Because it dwells so deep inside U
No king could put it there
2 get it, U gotta want it, U gotta need it, U gotta care
I'm talkin' about?
CHORUS
Good Judy gotta dance 2 this
Every time U cock it I can hit U on the up
I got a funky drummer and he just can't get enough
If U cannot cock it 'less the bass is on the floor
Then I'll have my mixer give U just a little more (Oh-we-oh)
I wanna battle 2night
Good Judy over there with the smoking jacket on
Look at that body pumpin'
Move that body strong (Oh-we-oh)
(Soul Psychodelicide) {x2}
Damn skippy, we been here before
We're just comin' on harder now
Hard on this feeling
Holy steppin?on solid ground (Oh-we-oh {x2})
(Soul Psychodelicide)
Judy go'n say that? (Oh-we-oh) (Soul Psychodelicide)
Judy wanna hear me sing?
CHORUS
(Oh yeah)
3 month's in, we got 9 2 go
Anybody in the house wanna stop this show? (Hell no!)
The people keep goin' on (Soul goes on and on {x2})
Keep dancin' till dawn
The soul that never stops
It just goes on and on and on and on...
(Soul goes on and on) {repeat}
(CHORUS) {repeat}
I do believe that I'm diggin' your house
And like a beautiful raging fire
Your heart is ready 4 a high
Good Judy need 2 do it - psychodelicide
Over and over {repeat}
And do it - psychodelicide
Do it - psychodelicide
Put your hand on my temple
Put your hand on my heart
Grind your hips next 2 mine
Don't U pull apart
Don't pull apart (Psychodelicide)
Don't U pull apart
CHORUS {repeat till end}
(Soul goes on and?
I can't stop this feeling I got {x4}
