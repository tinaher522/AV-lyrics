<song artist="Prince" title="Resolution">
The main problem with war
Is that nobody ever wins
The next generation grows up
And learns how to do it all over again
No matter who started the argument
Just matters how each one ends
How many people really want resolution
The main problem with people
Is they never do what they say
One minute they want peace
Then do everything to make it go away
Dropping bombs on each other
In the act of saving face
Tell me now people
How is that resolution
Either U do or U don't
Either U will or U won't
Making amends (Make amends)
A bitter pill to swallow

What can we lose if we try
With no water, a flower dies
With no 1 2 lead resolution will follow
Love is like a circle
No beginning and no end
A broken heart will mend
If U love it like your best friend
Handle your heart with care
It's as delicate as a whim
Winter storms come again
Break a resolution
Whether U will or U won't
Whether U do or U don't
Come on everybody all over the world
La-la-la-la
All over the world
Do-do-do-do
Tell me, how many people really want resolution
