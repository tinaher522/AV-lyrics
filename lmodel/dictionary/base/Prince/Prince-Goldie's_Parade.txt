<song artist="Prince" title="Goldie's_Parade">
U stick around
Goldnigga (what u hear at our concert is the real thing)
Be your own man
Endless abyss (what u hear at our concert is the real thing)
Do u love me? 
Is this just a carnival ride? 
We go round and round (what u hear at...)
As we go round and round
U stick around
We got a caller on the line, caller, caller on the..., hello
The land of a new power generation (who said that? )
Playin' the music 4 your mind, your body and your soul
The land of a new power generation
U stick around, but remember I'm the boss
Can I get some help over here
Another 30 seconds
Have u ever heard a horn so nasty? 
Goldnigga
Incubated society (clean it up, boy)
What u gonna do with your life? (this is smooth)
U stick around
(what u hear at our concert is the real thing)
And ain't shit changed in 20 years, y'all
(what... what u hear at our concert is the real thing)
2 all my fellow goldniggaz
U stick around

(what u hear at our concert is the real thing)
Instead of leading, we are being lead
But remember, I'm the boss
Caller, caller on the..., hello
Listen 2 the funky horn, y'all
Do u love me? 
Goldnigga
Playin' the music 4 your mind, your body and your soul
And ain't shit changed in 20 years, y'all
The land of a new power generation
We go round and round
Do u love me? 
Endless abyss
Incubated society
Is this just a carnival ride? 
The land of a new power generation
Is this just a carnival ride? 
Incubated society
The land of a new power generation
Is this just a carnival ride? 
In..in..incubated society
Goldnigga
Be your own man
U stick around, but remember I'm the boss
And I give all the orders {laughter}
