Keep bustin'!
Dig if U will the picture 
Of U and I engaged in a... kiss
U don't have 2 be beautiful 2 turn me on 
If we can not make babies
Maybe we can make some time
(Baby, U're so creamy)
She said how'd U like 2 waste some time 
And I could not resist when I saw little Nikki grind
Nikki, oh
Don't worry, I won't hurt U
I only want U 2 have some fun
Baby, baby, baby I'm a star (Star, ooh)
Might not know it now
Baby, but I are, I'm a star, eh (Star, ooh)
I don't wanna stop 'til I reach the top, oh
Ow!
If I gave U diamonds and pearls
Would U be a happy boy or a girl?
All I can do is just offer U my love
All I can offer U is my love
I never meant 2 cause U any sorrow
I never meant 2 cause U any pain
I only wanted one time 2 see U laughing
Only want 2 see U laughing in the purple rain 
Dearly beloved
We are gathered here 2day 2 get through this thing called life 
Sexy dancer, I want your body, want your body 
Sexy dancer, dance
Sexy dancer, I want your body, want your body 
Sexy dancer, dance
Ahhh!
Work it baby, work it
Let's work {x2}
I've had my eyes on U
Ever since U walked in the room
Come on and take my hand
Don't try 2 understand
Hey baby, nothing can stop us now
I'm gonna show U how, oh yeah
Show U how 2 work
Come on, let's have some fun
We'll work till the morning comes
Yeah yeah, I wanna see U work
Come on
Every Friday night I call yo ass up on the phone
A deeper voice answers and says U're not at home (Sexy {x4})
If U think that I'm some fool who'll go 4 that silly line 
Honey, put down all your money U win everytime, oh (Sexy {x4})
Oh, irresistible bitch - I love the way U walk (U sexy mutha...ow!)
Irresistible bitch - I love the way U talk
Irresistible bitch - I love the way U kiss (U sexy mutha...ow!)
Ain't it a shame?
Huh, I wish I could resist
I ain't trying 2 pressure U baby
But all I ever wanted 2 do
I wanna be your lover
I wanna be the only one that makes U come running
I wanna be your lover
I wanna turn U on, turn U out
All night long make U shout
Ooh, lover, yeah!

I wanna be the only one U come 4
Yeah {x4}
I'm goin' down 2 Alphabet Street
I'm gonna crown the first girl that I meet
I'm gonna talk so sexy, she'll want me from my head 2 my feet
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Talk 2 me lover, come and tell me what U taste 
Didn't your mama tell U life is 2 good 2 waste?
Talk 2 me lover, come and tell me what U taste 
Didn't your mama tell U life is 2 good 2 waste?
2 good 2 waste, 2 good 2 waste
Didn't your mama tell U life is 2 good 2 waste?
Love come quick
Love come in a hurry
There are thieves in the temple 2night
The moon up above shines down upon our skin
Whispering words that scream of outrageous sin
If that's what we are
We all want a love bizarre
If I was your girlfriend
Ooh, if I was your girlfriend
Would U let me wash your hair?
Could I make U breakfast sometime?
Would U let me pick out your clothes?
Would U let me drive U 2 work?
I was working part time in a 5 and dime
My boss was Mr. McGee
He told me several times that he didn't like my kind
'cause I's a bit 2 leisurely
It seems that I was busy doin' something close 2 nothin'
But different than the day before
That's when I saw her, ooh, I saw her
She walked in through the out door, out door
She wore a raspberry beret
The kind U find in a second hand store
Raspberry beret
And if it was warm, she wouldn't wear much more
Raspberry beret
I think I love her
Guess I shoulda known by the way U parked your car sideways 
That it wouldn't last
See, U're the kinda person that believes in makin' out once
Love 'em and leave 'em fast
Guess I must be dumb, she had a pocket full of horses
Trojan and some of them used
But it was Saturday night, I guess that makes it all right
And U say - "What have I got 2 lose?"
And honey, I said little red Corvette
This is it
Time for U 2 go 2 the wire 
U will hit
'cause U got the burnin' desire
The kinda girl U wanna teach
She's a peach
(Go!) {repeats}
(Oops, upside yo ass) {x5}
{Crowd noise}
Ladies and gentlemen, Prince!
