<song artist="Prince" title="Call_My_Name">
Call, call my name 
Call it, call my name 
Heard your voice this morning
Calling out my name
It had been so long since I heard it
That it didn't really sound quite the same, no
But it let me know, that my name
Had never really been spoken before
Before the day I carried you
Through the bridal path door
And ever since that day I haven't wanted anyone but you
And anybody who really knows me knows the truth
That I
I just can't stop writing songs about you 
I love you so much 
I just can't wait to get my arms around you 
And feel your touch
If I don't see you real soon baby girl
I might go insane
I know it's only been about 3 hours
But I love it when you call my name
I heard a voice on the news
Saying people want to stop the war (stop the war)
If they had a love as sweet as you
They'd forget what they were fighting for
What's the matter with the world today?
The land of the free? Somebody lied
They can bug my phone and people 'round my home
They'll only see you and me making love inside
I just can't stop writing songs about you 
I love you so much 
I just can't wait to get my arms around you 
And feel your touch
If I don't see you real soon baby girl
I might go insane
I know it's only been about 3 hours
But I love it when you call my name
Ah, call my name
Ah, call my name
I've never seen the moon look so lovely
As the night I saw it with you
It let me know I'd
Never seen the moon before
So many speak of the moon
As though it had no flaws
But to compare it to a beauty like yours
Would give one pause
Nothing about you is false
That's why your love is real
God forbid if you belonged to another
I'd have to steal you 
I'd have to take you from your man 
I might be tempted to break the law 'round here 
Because your beauty, it gives one pause 
It slows me down
I just can't stop writing songs about you 
I love you so much 
I just can't wait to get my arms around you 
And feel your touch
If I don't see you real soon baby girl
I might go insane
I know it's only been about 3 hours
But I love it when you call my name
Ah, call my name
Ah, call my name
Prince, that's right
