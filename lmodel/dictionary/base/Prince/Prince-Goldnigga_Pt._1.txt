<song artist="Prince" title="Goldnigga_Pt._1">
Hey, what up y'all? 
NPG's in the house kickin' the gift 
Talkin' about us livin' in an incubated society 
And ain't shit changed in 20 years y'all 
We just in a state of sobriety 
That's right - this one is subject 2 justification 
'cause we shootin' 4 heads of state 
Hmph, and 2 my brothers and sisters strugglin' 2 try and learn 
Don't be confused by the term... 
Ahh, Goldnigga - a term that might seem offensive 2 some 
But one we've adapted - that means the money's earned 
By the knowledge and creative efforts of a black man 
Who can feel good 'cause there's no blood on his hands 
In a time when respect is gotten, not from what a leader might say 
But 9 M's, Glock 7's and AK's 
It's a shame, but that's the way it is 
That's the reality of things - our state of mind has been twisted 
Demented in the way that seems irreversible 
2 much clout and status in the movers and shakers and people with pull 
Instead of leading, we are being led 
By generations of punk motherfu... Yo Tone, nuff said 
Yeah, U right, but I must speak on this 
Before me and my people die in this endless abyss 
So as we go round and round in an attempt 2 get bigger 
I send a shout out 2 all my fellow Goldniggaz 
Stay strong! 
CHORUS: 
Goldnigga - we can turn this mutha out 
Goldnigga - tell me what U're all about (Stay strong) 
Goldnigga - we can turn this mutha out 
Goldnigga - tell me what U're all about (Please, please stop!) 
Get up, stand up, stand up 4 your rights 
'cause Goldniggaz don't go out without a fight 
Mentality's 2 strong, we bring brothers who struggle along 
Nevermind preachin' about the prior things they had did wrong 
'cause every new day is a fresh start 
And I mean that shit from the bottom of my heart 
I place this burden on the shoulders with an upraisal in effect 
It's time we earn proper respect 
(Please stop!) {sample repeats in BG} 
Big up goldniggaz 
CHORUS 
(Yeah) (Come on, come on) 
(Mmm, say it) (We, we, we like it)
