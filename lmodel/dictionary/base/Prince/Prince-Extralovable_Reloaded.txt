<song artist="Prince" title="Extralovable_Reloaded">
I wanna rap a little bit, oh! 
Yeah! 
Baby, U got somethin' that would make 
A many hippie mighty proud 
U got a dozen little sexy tricks 
That doesn't seem that Miss U.S. would even allow 
Never do U boast like the other girls 
Who think they found a love 2 flaunt it (I never hear U brag) 
And what I dig the most is that U keep it in your hand 
Until I, until I, until I want it 
If ever honey U need someone 2 take a shower with girl 
Call me up and scream 
Extra lovable, honey don't U wanna, don't U wanna 
Take a bath with me? 
Listen...
Baby, U could turn my mama on 
She's just as straight, just as straight as straight can be 
Even though my daddy's gone 
Come back just 2 haunt U, come back just 2 haunt U mystically 
(Yes he will) 
Baby, I know my rap is hard 
Not as hard as what's behind door (dig it), door number pants 
Baby, U're so sure, I'd love 2 see U dancin' naked 
Ooh sugar, I wanna see U dance 
If ever honey U need someone 2 take a shower with girl 
Call me up and scream 
Extra lovable, honey don't U wanna, don't U wanna 
Take a bath with me? 
Don't U wanna get, don't U wanna get off? 
Baby, U got something that would make 
A many hippie mighty proud (Then play it loud!) 
U got a dozen little sexy tricks 
That doesn't seem that Miss U.S., ooh, would even allow 
Yeah, never do U boast like the other girls 
Who think they found a love 2 flaunt it 
(Oh, play with this love, yeah, let me tell ya) 
What I dig the most is the way that U keep your sugar in your
hand 
Till I want it 
If ever honey U need someone 2 take a shower with mama (There it
is) 
Call me up and scream 
Extra lovable, honey don't U wanna, don't U wanna 
Take a bath with me? 
Ooh, sugar baby, U're so fine 
What say U and me go 2 my place and make some time? 
I'm not that popular yet, so if U want, I'm yours 
"I don't want anyone 2 see what we're gonna do" 
Think U better shut the door 
(Ooh!) 
Do U know what I'm talkin' about? (I say ooh ooh!) 
If U know it, let me hear U say it baby (I say ooh!) 
I can't hear U (Ooh ooh!) 
Purple politicians, sing it (Ooh!) 
Come on, 2 times, sing it (Ooh ooh!) 
One time (Ooh!) 
2 times (Ooh ooh!) 
I wanna rap a little bit (One time, ooh!) 
I said my daddy might be dead 
But he'll know what is she (Anybody, 2 times, ooh ooh!) 
Heaven knows I told him 
She's bad as U could be (One time, ooh!) 
Oh, yeah (2 times, say ooh ooh!) 
(Ooh!) 
Extra lovable, extra lovable 
(U got it, 2 times, say ooh ooh!)

Would anybody care 2 get naked? 
Extra lovable

Hey Dez, don't U like my band? (Ooh ooh!) (Gotta, gotta say it

Everybody, Brownmark say (Ooh!) (Everybody else sing it) 
Brownmark, Brownmark say (Ooh ooh!) (Extra lovable) 
I can't hear U, say (Ooh!) 
This ain't just about your body, baby 
It's about your mind (Ooh ooh!) 
Come on and take the drop, baby 
And spare some time (Ooh!) 
I'm on the verge of rape 
I don't think U heard me (Ooh ooh!) 
I'm on the verge of rape 
I'm on the.. 
I'm sorry, but I'm just gonna have 2 rape U 
Now are U going 2 get into the tub or do I have 2 drag U? 
Don't make me drag U 
I can be very cruel 
Yeah!
