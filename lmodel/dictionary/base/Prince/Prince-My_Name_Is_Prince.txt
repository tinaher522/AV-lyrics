Prince and the New Power Generation
(I wanna be your lover) (Partyup) (Controversy) (Prince)
(I wanna be your lover) (Partyup) (Controversy)
(I wanna be your lover) (Partyup) (Controversy) (Prince)
(I wanna be your lover) (Partyup) (Controversy)
My name is Prince and I am funky
My name is Prince, the one and only
I did not come 2 funk around
Till I get your daughter, I won't leave this town
In the beginning (funky) God made the sea
But on the 7th day He made me
He was tryin' 2 rest y'all when He heard the sound
Sound like a guitar cold gettin' down
I tried 2 bust a high note, but I bust a string
My God was worried until he heard me sing
My name is Prince and I am funky
My name is Prince, the one and only
Hurt me!
(Do that, do that somebody) {x8}
Hurt me!
My name is Prince and I am funky
When it come 2 funk, I am a junkie
I know from righteous, I know from sin
I got 2 sides and they both friends
Don't try 2 clock 'em, they're much 2 fast
If U try 2 stop 'em, they'll kick that ass
Without a pistol, without a gun
When U hear my music, U be havin' fun
That's when I gotcha, that's when U mine
2 tell the truth, tell me what's my line?
My name is Prince and I am funky (U can't stop Prince)
My name is Prince, the one and only (U can't stop Prince)
Hurt me!
(Do that, do that somebody) {x4}
Funky fresh 4 the 90's (Prince)
My name is Prince, I don't wanna be King
Cuz I've seen the top and it's just a dream
Big cars and women and fancy clothes
Will save your face but it won't save your soul
I'm here 2 tell U that there's a better way
Would our Lord be happy if He came 2day?
I ain't sayin' I'm better, no better than U, huh
But if U want 2 play with me, U better learn the rules (Ow!)
My name is Prince and I am funky (U can't stop Prince)
My name is Prince, the one and only (U can't stop Prince)
I did not come 2 funk around (U can't stop Prince)
Till I get your daughter, I won't leave this town
I won't leave this town {x2}
I won't leave this, leave this, leave this…
My name is Prince and I am funky (U can't stop Prince)
My name is Prince the one and only (U can't stop Prince)
Funky fresh 4 the 90's
(Do that, do that somebody) {x4}
Hurt me!
The funkier I be, the funkier I get, ooh shit
Lickety split on the lyric, a new jack in the pulpit
Watch it deacon, your track is leakin'
What is this U're seekin'?
The syncopated rhymes are at their peak when…
U jumped on my D.I.C.K.
That's the one thing I don't play
The jock strap was 2 big 4 U anyway
U're just a simpleton
I'll bust U like a pimple, son
My star is 2 bright, boy
I'll sink U like the ship Poseidon Adventure
U're bumpin' dentures 2 be cocksure
There must be more coming from your mouth than manure
So with a flow and a spray, I say hey
U must become a Prince before U're King anyway
(Do that, do that somebody) {x2}
It's time I get ig-ig-ig-ig-ig-ig-ignorant
Def be the beat that I'm rockin'
Yo, so come get a hit
And put your thinking cap on
U've been forewarned
I call upon the inner forces I've got brewin' in my cauldron
That means my nugget, sometimes I'm rugged
The style I possess be havin' the other brothers buggin'
And this is 4 those who oppose
And propose 2 overexpose, disclose
Pose a threat 2 my brother
Like any other man makin' a stand
I'll be damned if I let U play this hand
I'm the blackjack dealer and the cards are stacked
What do U expect 2 win when U're used 2 playing craps?
Yeah, let's get ig'nant in this mutha, hmm
(Do that, do that somebody) {x2}
It's gettin' tricky, that means a sticky situation
2 resurrect a groove with feeling and give it this much affection
Passion flows who knows what lurks in the gallows of my mind
I put my foot in the ass of Jim Crow
12 inches of non-stop soul
I'm on a roll - yo P, it's time 4 the show
So do that, do that somebody
Wave your hands in the air, this is a motherfuckin' party
While U're layin' back, I'm on the attack
Paddywhack - give yourself a bone
This is my house and I'm prone
2 layin' some chrome upside some motherfucker's dome
And I'm out
My name is Prince and I am funky
My name is Prince, the one and only
My name is Prince {x10}
