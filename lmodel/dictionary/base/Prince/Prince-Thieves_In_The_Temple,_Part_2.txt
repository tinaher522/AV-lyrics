{Long version of Thieves In The Temple}
I'm holdin' on (I'm holdin' on) the best that I can
Love please, (let me be) let me be the better man
Better than the ones that wanna count me out
Better than the ones that don't know what my love's about
I'm talkin' 'bout the kinda love that can move a mountain
The kinda love that could part the sea
The kinda love that'll last 4 ever
(no matter what u say we should be together)
U should be with me (thieves in the temple)
Yeah, u should be with me
I said I wanna know (talk to me)
one thing (talk to me)
said I wanna know (talk to me)
I wanna know one thing, baby (talk to me)
How come you said that I was your baby
When u and your love was gonna leave
U led me on, led me on thinkin' U was Moses
Herding sheep blindly through a fantasy
U done me wrong (thieves in the temple)
And everybody knows it
Now the sound of my voice is pumpin' in your chest
More or less, I am here to tell u that
I am the best
Better than the rest
Better than the thieves in the temple tonight
tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, hurt me
(Put it in)
Thieves in the temple
Thieves in the temple
Thieves in the temple
Thieves in the temple tonight
Put your foot on the rock
Let me show you how to clock
Put your foot on the rock
Let me show you how to clock
Thieves in the temple
(What the....?)
Who got the party, who got the party, who?
Who got the party, who got the party, who?
Who got the party, who got the party, who?
Who got the party, who got the party, who?
(hurt me)
Thieves in the temple
