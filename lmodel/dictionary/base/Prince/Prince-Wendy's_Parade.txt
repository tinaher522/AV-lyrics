<song artist="Prince" title="Wendy's_Parade">
Ow!
Everyone come behold little girl Wendy's parade
The show will proceed unless it should rain strawberry lemonade
Hopefully that will not occur, the man above has been paid
Give what U can, all U can stand, and all of your life will be made
Everyone should come and dig little girl Wendy's guitar
The chord strikes, the devil no like, so he runs 2 his evil car
Everyone come behold little girl Wendy's parade
Goodness will guide us if love is inside us
Little girl Wendy's parade {x3}
