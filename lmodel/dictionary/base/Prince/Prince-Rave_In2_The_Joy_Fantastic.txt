Rave in2 the joy fantastic - Rave!
Rave in2 the joy fantastic - Rave!
World full of lovers, city full of good times - Rave!
Don't go undercover, I can get you out of yo mind, come on - Rave!
All you need is a DJ and an urge to move (Are you ready?)
We can get this party on, don't ya wanna groove?
Rave in2 the joy fantastic - Rave!
Everybody rave in2 the joy fantastic - Rave!
Arrividerci cock poppy, I just need a funky beat
To get my body movin' up outta my seat
Tell me y'all, ain't that the bomb?
Mack daddy ain't got no gun
We just droppin' this needle right dat there up on the one
(The one most scandalous)
Rave in2 the joy fantastic - Rave!
Everybody rave in2 the joy fantastic - Rave!
Tell me y'all, ain't that the bomb?
Everybody got a new thang - Scandalous (Rave)
Ooh, you're so hot, boo
Ahh, you've got to..
Rave in2 the joy fantastic - Rave!
(Into the shining light)
Rave in2 the joy fantastic - Rave!
(It ain't a sin to party all night)
Rave in2 the joy fantastic supergroovelastic funk
Guaranteed to make you shake
Move something round your big ole trunk
Punk sucka talkin' plenty gettin' yo Henny on
Grab your partner by the hand
And dance to this song, come on
Brotha playin' an Apache scar!
Gaultier - stop!
(Whoa whoa whoa)
Rave in2 this joy fantastic
Moneyapolis Beautiful Strange
Pump it up loud New York City
Headbobbin' in the Range
Baby knows where to go
Tangerine, but I like your flow
Tonight we get tight, uhh
Until the morning light
Rave in2 the joy fantastic - Rave!
(Into the morning, the morning light)
Rave in2 the joy fantastic - Rave!
(It ain't a sin to party all night)
Rave in2 the joy fantastic - Rave!
Rave in2 the joy fantastic - Rave!
Rave in2 the joy fantastic - Rave!

Rave in2 the joy fantastic - Rave!
