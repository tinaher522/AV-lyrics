<song artist="Prince" title="Man_O_War">
Why you screaming?
You know I'm not a man of war
Break the gold chain that I gave you
Throw it down on the floor
Instead of this 7 page letter
I wish I had piece of mind
My friends tell me, "You should go get her"
But loving you, loving you, loving you is a waste of time
Oh yes, it is, a waste of time, ooh
I need to get out of this city
I need to get you out of my head
I need to get away from the words that you said to me
Why you screaming?
(Ooh)
You know I'm not a man of war
How could you think that
I could put something inside of someone
That I put inside you, inside you?
Even if I tried to, tried to
(Tried to, tried to)
I couldn't 'cause I still smell like the last time that we
Loving you, loving you, loving you is a waste of time
(A waste of time)
Oh, yes it is
Loving you, a waste of time
(Ooh oh)
I need to feel wanted again
I need to feel love is alive, yeah
I need to hear you say
That you ain't looking for another reason to make me cry
Why you screaming?
(Ooh)
You know I'm not a man of war
I've been trying to make you happy, baby
Ever since we were sophomores
(But loving you, loving you, loving you)
Is a waste of time, oh yes, it is
Oh, is a waste of time, waste of time, waste of time
If there's no future then there is no past
And all we've got is right now
Let's make it last
Make it last, make it last
(Ooh)
Why you screaming?
You know I'm not a man of war
Break the gold chain
(Break the gold chain that I gave you)
Throw it down on the floor, oh baby
Instead of this 7 page letter
I wish I had piece of mind
(My friends tell me, "You should go get her"¬ù)
Tell me, "You should go get her"
(But loving you)
Loving you, loving you, loving you
Is a waste of time
(A waste of time)
Oh, a waste of time, oh yeah
I need to get out of this city
I need to get you out of my head
I need to
I need to get away from the words that you said to me
I need to
I need to feel wanted again
Oh, I need to hear no sin
Hear me
(But loving you, loving you, loving you)
Why you screaming?
You know I'm not a man of war
Break the gold chain that I gave you
Throw it down on the floor, oh baby
Instead of this 7 page letter
I wish I had piece of mind
My friends tell me, "You should go get her"
But loving you, loving you, loving you is a waste of time
