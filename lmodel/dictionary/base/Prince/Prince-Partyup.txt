<song artist="Prince" title="Partyup">
We don't give a damn
We just want to jam
Party up (Party up, got to party up)
That Army bag
Such a double drag
Party up (Party up, got to, got to, got to party up) 
(Party) Got to party down, baby
Revolutionary rock and roll
Goin' Uptown, baby,
How you gonna make me kill somebody 
I don't even know?
They got the draft, uh, uh
I just laugh
Party up (Party up, got to party up)
Fightin' war is such a fuckin' bore
Party up (Party up, got to, got to, got to party up)
(Party) Uh, uh, got to party down, babe
Ooh, it's all about what's in your mind
Goin' Uptown, baby,
I don't wanna die I just wanna have a bloody good time
Party up
Got to party up
Party up 
Got to party up
Because of their half-baked mistakes
We get ice cream
No cake
All lies
No truth
Is it fair to kill the youth?
Party up
Party up
Got to party up yeah
Got to party up babe, ooh
Got to party up yeah
Got to party up babe, ooh
Got to party up yeah
Oooh ooh
Got to party up babe, ooh 
Got to party up yeah
Got to party up babe, whoo
Yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah
(Party up - gotta party up) 
Party up - Got to party up baby {repeated}
Revolutionary Rock and Roll
Party up - gotta party up
Party up - gotta party up
Party up - gotta party up
Party up - gotta party up
Party up - gotta party up
Party up - gotta party up, babe
Party up - gotta party up {continues in background}
you're gonna have to fight your own damn war
Cuz we don't wanna fight no more
you're gonna have to fight your own damn war
Cuz we don't wanna fight no more
you're gonna have to fight your own damn war
Cuz we don't wanna fight no more
you're gonna have to fight your own damn war
Cuz we don't wanna fight no more
I said we don't wanna fight no more (gonna have to fight your own damn war)
Cuz we don't wanna FIGHT NO MORE!
