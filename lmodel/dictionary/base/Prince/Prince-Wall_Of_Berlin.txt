<song artist="Prince" title="Wall_Of_Berlin">
Where am I?
Universe of paradoxical design
Reality merely in the mind
In my head or in some German town
She said "you want a four leafed clover in the ground?"
Ain't superstitious and I don't believe in luck
I heard the thunder before the lightning struck
Couldn't read the writing cause it was so small
But according to the document she got on the wall
She is down, like the Wall of Berlin
I come round about a quarter to ten
We just met, oh at least we pretend
It's so fresh knocking down the Wall of Berlin
Where am I?
Galaxy of monumental delight
Or parallel hologram copyright
The car comes unexpected like a mother in the park
The sound of a train, it erupts the question mark
I like it
Who are you gonna be tonight baby?
Is that the queen of Sheba or an alien dream
The marks on the table say somewhere in between
Not one for rituals but one thing I've found
Everything's better when your come around
We get down, like the wall of Berlin
I come round about a quarter to ten
We just met, oh at least we pretend
It's so fresh knocking down the Wall of Berlin
