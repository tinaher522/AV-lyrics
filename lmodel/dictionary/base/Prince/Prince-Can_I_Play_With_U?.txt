No!
(Prince) {x2}
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Saw U standin' over by the wall
Lookin' like U havin' no fun at all
If U want me and U have The Ball
Just give me your number baby, I'll give U a call
Hey baby, can I talk 2 U?
Can I walk with U?
Can I stay with U?
Can I play with U 2night?
No!
Lord, I wanna play with U
No!
Can I play with U?
I noticed that U were not havin' fun
Maybe it's because U ain't talkin' 2 anyone
Just give me a sign, pretty mama, and I'll be your number one
U and I creep 2 my house and then we'll take off everything
Hey baby, can I talk 2 U?
Can I walk with U?
Can I stay with U?
Can I play with U 2night?
No! Shh....
Can I play with U, mama?
Pretty mama
No! No!
I can tell U never really understood
The difference between bad and good
I can turn U out girl, U know I could
Let me talk, let me talk, let me talk, can I talk 2 U?
Oww!
I wanna play with U
Lemme talk, lemme talk, lemme talk 2 U, mama
Oww!
