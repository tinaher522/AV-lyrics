<song artist="Prince" title="Underneath_The_Cream">
Wait a minute...
Turn the, turn the phones up
Yeah...cool 
Lookin' out the window of a big black limousine 
Thinkin' bout your thighs
Wishin' I was somewhere in between 
In one single motion
Deep inside your ocean
I just wanna be 
Underneath the cream
Can't stop thinkin' about ya'...thighs 
Somewhere in between
That's where I wanna be, that's where I wanna be 
Underneath the cream
You and I
Somewhere in between
Your thighs 
Cell phone, passport
All your inhibitions
Spread out on the floor 
(Deep inside)
Deep inside your life-givin' ocean, sugarpop 
Rests my consciousness just a little more
Is what I wanna do, babe 
So talk to me
Don't get me started
Come into this wet dream-eternal 
Pretend I am you and teach me without shame
Take my hand, put it in the place 
That turned you out the most last time you came 
Useless deliberation, the beast of frustration
Trust me, I know 
Somewhere in between seven days and nights
That's how far, baby 
You wanna go? 
Underneath the cream
Can't stop thinkin about ya'...thighs 
Somewhere in between
That's where I wanna be, that's where I wanna be 
Underneath the cream
You and I
Somewhere in between
Your thighs, your thighs 
Somewhere in between this wet dream, it seems
I never shoulda let you go 
Now that you've returned I yearn to learn
All the feelings you never dared to show 
Come into this wet dream eternal
Pretend I am you and let's, Oh 
Somewhere in between, I dream/Underneath the cream 
Tell me, tell me, tell me
Whatcha waitin' on baby, tell me 
We can do this thing, yeah
Underneath the cream 
We need to get right down
Cuz I got something 
Groovy groovy groovy...
(Groovy underneath the cream) 
It's groovy underneath the cream
Underneath the cream
