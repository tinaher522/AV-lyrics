Color me black if u color me just like u
Color me angry if u color me less than I do
(whoa, what's your color? )
Yeah, what's your color? 
(whoa, what's your color? )
What's your color? 
Color me happy if u teach me what I need 2 know
Color me gone if u don't, if u don't 'cause every child needs 2 grow
This I know
(whoa, what's your color? )
Oh, what's your color, yeah? 
I wanna know
(whoa, what's your color? )
Oh, what's your color? 
Listen (listen)
Love is my color when I'm shown love in return
But when I am not, it's a bet u can guess what I have learned
What's my color? 
Hey
Color me green (color me green) if I cannot have what u've got
Color me blue (blue) until I do 'cause the fire will sho'nuff be hot
Yes it will

(whoa, what's your color? )
What's your color, yeah? 
Hey yeah
(whoa, what's your color? )
What's your color, yeah? 
Oh, make me a promise (make me a promise)
Oh, make me a promise (that whatever u color me) that whatever u color me
U will at least color me then I can color u 2
What's your color? 
(whoa, what's your color? )
What's your color, yeah? 
Hey
Color
(whoa, what's your color? )
What's your color? 
(whoa, what's your color? )
What's your color, yeah? 
What's your color? 
Make it love
What's your color? 
Mine is love
(whoa, what's your color? ) yeah
(whoa, what's your color? )
What's your color?
