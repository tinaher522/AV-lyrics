Hey fellas
You ever have one them girls that just bad 
Know what I mean?
No, I ain't talkin' about fine, I'm talkin' about bad! 
Cuss all the time, steal..,man she rob her own moms 
Down at the post office got two pictures 
I'm talkin' about one of Bebe's kids, y'all - bad!
Hear me?
Oh, she fine too 
Chorus: 
I don't know why, I want that girl 
I don't know why, I want that girl 
T'was the middle of the summer
Rather late in the day 
This pretty thang, she walked up to me 
Said she was good to play
She told me to close my eyes, ooh 
So she could get a kiss
(Sure honey) 
I said sure honey, and obliged 
Girl snatched my medallion and called me a bitch, honey! 
Don't know why, I want that girl {x4} 
I found out her place of employment 
Dry cleaning - "we do fine" (hahahahah) 
To manifest a little unenjoyment in her life 
Was all that was running through the middle of my mind 
There are many elements: wind, wine, water 
But none quite like the element of surprise 
See my baby, she gave me that medallion 
And it, uh, you know, it mean a lot to me so 
I walked up in that piece with a disguise on 
And I said hey! I don't know what your name or your game is 
But you better get your G-hind down on the floor 
'cause you see, I'm in a mood to do something koo-koo to you 
So she gave me that kiss and ran out the back door 
Don't know why, I want that girl {x4}
