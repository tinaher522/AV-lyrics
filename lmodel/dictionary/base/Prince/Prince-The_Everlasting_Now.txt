((Now ...))
I knew this dude, he was very cool
He used 2 rule until he went 2 school
Not a normal school that breeds a fool
But the one that teaches men aren't fit 2 rule
That's when he took his pearly crown
He raised it up and spun it 'round
And tossed into the deep blue underground
No longer lead by the ways of men
He looked 4 the kingdom deep within
That's when the drums in his head began 2 pound
Don't let nobody bring U down
Accurate knowledge of Christ and the Father
Will bring the everlasting now
Join the party, make a sound
Share the truth, preach the good news
Don't let nobody bring U down
The everlasting now
(We want Prince) {x2}
Now turn the page, at an early age
This brotha on stage, he was all the rage
He taught an integrated world 2 sing
The color U are don't mean a thing
Everybody's a star all the everyday people sang
He changed the funk, put it in a bag
Then he changed the colors of the flag
But U can't teach a dog new tricks if the tail don't wag
Don't no matter how much money U made
All the cars U got and all the women U laid
If U mess with the flag, 2 them U're still a spade
Don't let nobody bring U down
Accurate knowledge of Christ and the Father
Will bring the everlasting now
Join the party, come on, make a sound
Share the truth, preach the good news
Don't let nobody bring U down
The everlasting now
(We want Prince) {repeated}
All right
Band!
See this girl in her make-believe world
Plastic boobs and clip-on curls
'Round the pole see her big butt twirl
Oh, these are the dreams that do unfurl
Never everlasting
Turn it up!
Don't let nobody bring U down
The everlasting now (We want Prince)
Now
Now watch that girl in her make-believe world
Plastic boobs and clip-on curls
'Round the pole see her big butt twirl
Electric beaches, skin do bake
Vanilla fudge and wedding cake
If U should die before U wake
U got any last requests 2 make?
The everlasting now {x3}
Hit me!
(Hey) {repeated}
Like a, like a pancake, flip me over
I'm done
Johnny B. Well bring the beat
(We want Prince) {x2}
Now
"From this day 4ward till times indefinite,
those who love Christ are the ones who benefit.
All the players' ice melted into one platinum chain,
and in a downward spiral it dripped down the drain."
"U know, this is funky but I just wish he'd play like he used 2
Old scragglyhead sum-a..." {as in sumbitch} {slap sound} Oh!
Don't let nobody (Let nobody) bring U down (Bring U down)
Accurate knowledge of Christ and the Father
Will bring the everlasting now
Join the party, come on, make a sound
Share the truth, preach the good news
Don't let nobody bring U down
The everlasting now, oh yeah
The everlasting now, hey hey
The everlasting now, oh
The everlasting now, now, now, now
(We want Prince) {repeated}
Everlasting now
Tear it up!
We ain't through
It's gettin' sticky
Break, wait, on the one
Psyche!
Keep it still, keep
Put the fork in that, ha ha
(We want Prince) {repeated}
