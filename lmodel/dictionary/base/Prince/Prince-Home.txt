<song artist="Prince" title="Home">
I came down to find you here
Celibate and all alone
Travelin' in a caravan of Isis tears
I've come to claim you for my own
Of course you're scared the 1st time I appear
Because many seek your throne
There's no need to worry, no need to fear
You should just feel at home
Home, home, home, at home
Home, home, home, at home, home
And I keep it down, you were up in arms
A house full of thieves and liars
A restless heart so easily charmed
Could end up in a bed of fire
Of course you're scared first time I say
Let me help you tap on that dome
There's no need to run from your one and only desire
I've come to bring peace to your home
Home, home, home, your home
Home, home, home, your home
I came down to hear you say
At last you're finally satisfied
There was never any other who could ever be your lover
And never truly get inside you
Touch the core of what we all live for
Everlastin' paradise
But you see that in your life there are many houses
But now you've finally got a home
Home, home, home, a home
Home, home, home, a home
I only wanna cleanse your feet with Isis tears
And make you feel at home
I only wanna cleanse your feet with Isis tears
And make you feel at home
Home, home, home, home, home, home
Home, home, home, welcome home
Home, home
