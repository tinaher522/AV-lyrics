<song artist="Prince" title="Pearls_B4_The_Swine">
If I leave my front door open
would u come and visit me?
Just 2 slander my name hopin'
that I would pack my bags and leave...
If I did would u remember
2 feed the dove and clean the cage?
And never count in front of the children
lest they die of old age
I don't really know y we have 2 go r separate ways
Whether or not we grow after the seeds r shown
Only time can say...
Can I offer u baklava?
or a bagel with cream cheese?
Will we say grace 2 r father
holding hands down on r knees?
R we better off just fighting?
U on ur side, me on mine
R the words that I keep writing...
only pearls b4 the swine?
What makes men claim that u're a friend
when u're not at all?
They knock u down and then,
they lift u up again, just 2 c u fall...
But like a bird I'll keep on singing...
a song that never leaves ur mind
If nothing else u've taught me one thing...
"Never cast ur pearls b4 the swine"
