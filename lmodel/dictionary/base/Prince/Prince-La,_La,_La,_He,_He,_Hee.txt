{B-side of Sign O' The Times}
I am a dog outside your door
I have been there since a quarter to four
You are a cat licking intense
I bite your leg in self-defense
Say it! Uurh, uurh, uurh, uurh
Say it! Uurh, uurh, uurh, uurh
Get out my tree, grinning at me
Licking your tail like its cream
Stroking your whiskers, causing a scene
That's not the way to be to me (That's not the way)
Say it! Uurh, uurh, uurh, uurh
Say it! Uurh, uurh, uurh, uurh
And the doggy say to the kitty
La, La, La, He, He, Hee
I want you, you want me
Oh how sexy it will be
If we ever get together in my tree
Say it! Uurh, uurh, uurh, uurh
Say it! Uurh, uurh, uurh, uurh
Hey little pussy you sure look sweet
Knocking me off of my 4 feet (Knocking me off of my 4 feet) {My 4 feet}
Sure do wish dogs could climb (I wish, I wish) 
Then we could have a funky good time
Say it! Uurh, uurh, uurh, uurh
Say it again! Uurh, uurh, uurh, uurh
Why you wink at me? (Why you wink at me?)
I don't wanna see (I don't wanna see)
Nasty little cat up up in a tree (Up) {Up}
Is it really worth-a one night of fun?
You've got 9 lives, I only got one
Say it! Uurh, uurh, uurh, uurh
And the doggy say to the kitty
La, La, La, He, He, Hee
I want you, you want me
Oh how sexy it will be
If we ever get together in my tree
I'm picking up your scent
