<song artist="Prince" title="Northside">
This is how we funk on the Northside
CHORUS:
This is how we funk on the Northside
Players ain't gon' stop till it's sold
This is how we funk on the Northside
2 get paid in the Moneyapple, got 2 be bold
When U cop your paper next Friday
This is what I want U all 2 do
Nevermind the vapor come up my way
We got something freaky 4 U
Never U mind what U find in the state of your mind
Your city or part of town
When U get up in the Moneyapple
Baby U got 2 get down
Down {x9}
Hey hey hey hey!
CHORUS
(Oh)
(This is how we funk)
When U get tired of the Muzak
That's playin' on that no-funk radio (Uh)
We gotta taste the bass that'll take your face 2 the Ace of Spades
U never ever thought your ugly face would go
Bass - tell ya one time
Never U cry when U buy a sample single
From the NPG got joints 4 days
Chart be gone we get it on stage, baby
Aftershow's on the Internet, players gettin' paid!
Hey, this is how we funk
Oh yeah
Hey, this is how we funk
(Hey) Everybody say
CHORUS
(Oh, oh)
(How we funk)
(How) {x3}
With a bone 2 play
We can find the mayor
Talk about that piece of land
Fill a garden y'all
Fill a fan with some hand picked images like the man
Sweet potatoes like U never seen (Tell it)
Martin wasn't the only one that had a dream
Know what I mean? (Woo!)
CHORUS {x3}
(This is how we, this is how we funk)
(We, we be...)
(NPG, so funky it's good 2 me)
(Northside) (Hey)
This is how we funk on the Northside {x2}
Got 2 be bold (Got 2 be)
This is how we funk on the Northside {x5}
