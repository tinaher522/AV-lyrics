<song artist="Prince" title="Art_Official_Cage">
Welcome Home, class
You've come a long way
(You've come a long way)
(You've come a long way)
Mine damer og herrer
Konger og dronninger og alt det midt imellem
Velkommen til timen
I skal til at gøre noget der vil forandre jeres liv for evigt
Cage
åben det her bur
(Come on let's go)
(Free people, come on let's go)
(Free the people, free the people)
Eye woke up in the city in a bit of a rage
Determined to free my mind from this art official cage
Thought more than the teacher's taught from an early age
A place in heaven far off in the future
Come on let's go
Free the people, come on let's go
Art official
Art official cage
Ghettos to the left of me, Marz to the right
Why does my kingdom come only where's at night
Why should I expect if eye'm not willing to fight
A place in heaven somewhere in the future
Art official, art official
Art official cage
Louder than a bomb since the day of my birth
Got me second class when eye got here first
Lovely score but how am eye supposed 2 know what it's worth
Art official age in the future
Free the people, come on let's go
Starting from the top, getting higher so
Never going back underwater, no
Brand new boogie without the "yao"
Sure Minneapolis get this, snow
Eye'm going up lady liberty's dress and blow, blow, blow
Art official, free the people
Art official, art official
Cage, cage, cage
Art official cage
We need you to tell us what u know
We need you to tell us what u know
Art official cage
Art official cage
Art official cage
Art official cage
Cage, cage, cage, cage, cage, cage
