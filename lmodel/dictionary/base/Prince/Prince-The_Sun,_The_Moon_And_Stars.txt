<song artist="Prince" title="The_Sun,_The_Moon_And_Stars">
It's late and I'm runnin out of clever things 2 say
The kind that would bring a girl like U 2 tears
There's only 1 more glass of this rose'
Let's throw it on the fire with our past 
And dance the night away
Until the sun, the moon and stars
Don't seem as far as they did yesterday
The sun, the moon and stars
In love we are - 4ever, always
It's late and I think it's 'bout time for U and me 2 get closer
2 get closer than we ever did before - ohh
Whenever there's a tide U can let it ride inside your interior
Lay back, relax upon my shore,  oh-oh
Ohh baby, I wanna make love 2 U right here
One inside the other one - no fear, we're here 
Until the sun, the moon and stars
Don't seem as far as they did yesterday
The sun, the moon and stars
In love we are - 4ever, always
Blow out this candle sunlight
Come lay down next 2 me
And paint another rainbow, oh~we
Ohhh eclipse this light with ecstasy
Do u like I do.
One, one, one, one, come on, come on
It's late and I'm walkin' out of what 2 say
The kinda lucky rhyme make a chippy wanna say
Whisper in the valley 2 me rock - n - rose'
Do u like I do come on and dance the night away
It's late but b4 they get 2 close the door
U and me we got 2 get out on the floor
Come on let the tide ride in and out the shore
I wanna love U once again - then some more
Lay u're head back I got my hand behind your head
Like U do the limbo 'cept it's on the bouncy bed
Bouncin on the Summer Spring and when U start 2 Fall
U'll come like a cold Winter do in Montreal
Come on baby, under the sun and moon and stars
Let the tide ride (2x)
The sun, the moon and stars
Don't seem as far as they did yesterday
The sun, the moon and stars
In love we are - 4ever, always
