<song artist="Prince" title="Love's_No_Fun">
Everyday I used 2 watch U pass my house on the way 2 school
My heart skipped 4 beats checking out the way your body moved
No one can walk the way U do, it's so cool (So cool)
Imagine how I felt when I saw my best friend with her arm around U
Love's no fun when the one U love don't love U
I went 2 a movie show, the only place that I could go away from U
I seem 2 see your face in every part of my life, no matter what I do
But there U were 4 everyone 2 see, kissing like fools
I covered my face and pretended that I didn't know what I knew
That love's no fun when the one U love don't love U, oh
I go 2 bed early every night so I can dream
Of another space and another time when U belonged 2 me
And in my dreams U talk 2 me whispering oh so sweet (So sweet)
U promised that if I'm always there 4 U, U'll be there 4 me
(With U, with U)
And then I wake and say that love's no fun without U (No it ain't, no no)
Love's no fun when the one U love don't love U
(I don't wanna be without love)
Love's no fun when the one U love don't love U
(Do U hear me, do U hear me?)
Love's no fun when the one U love don't love U, oh
