How y'all feel?
Y'all feel good?
Alright now
Girl, I know this might seem strange
But let me know if I'm out of order
For stepping to you this way
See, I've been watching you for awhile, now
And I just gotta let'cha know
That I'm really feeling your style
Cuz I had to know your name, babe
And leave you with my number
And I hope that you would call me someday
Now if you want now you can give me yours to, yeah
If you don't, well I ain't mad at you, nah
We can still be cool cuz...
(I'm not trying to pressure you) Sing it, what?
(Just can't stop thinkin' 'bout you) Can't hear you
(You ain't even really) ...gotta be my (girlfriend) Oh no
(I just wanna know your name) Know it
(And maybe)...sometime
(We can hook up...) And what? (hang out...) When what? (just chill)
Aw baby
She called
Damn, I'm surprised that you called
Cuz the way you walked away
I thought that you won't see me no more
Since you didn't wanna give me your name
Thought that you were...
What?
Alright
But anyway, what you doing tonight
I'll probably be with my peoples
If it's cool with you, maybe we'll swing by
You can just chill with us
Or you can just chill with me
Long as you're comfortable
And you feel secure when you're with me, see
I'm not trying to...(pressure you)
What? (Just can't stop thinkin' 'bout you)
Sing it (you ain't even really...) even (...gotta be my girlfriend)
You ain't even gotta be my girlfriend, oh no
Oh yeah yeah
Everybody in the house tonight, yo, make some noise
Yeah yeah
{scatting}
Lord
Oh babe
Yeah, thank you very much
I appreciate it
Preach your love, y'all
