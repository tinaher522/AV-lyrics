<song artist="Prince" title="3_Chains_O'_Gold">
If I don't think about the fact that she left me
If I don't see the pearls fall from the sky
If I don't hear the accusations of blasphemy
If I don't feel the tears in my eyes
This is the best day of my life
U say u'll call me and then u don't
I'll want 2 kiss u and then I won't
We both do nothing and call it love
Is this love?
Is this love?
This morning I wanted a cup of coffee
But I didn't have any cream
Last night I wanted some inspiration
But I didn't have any dreams
Couple with the fact that u belong 2 another
Whose name is self-righteousness
So evil girl, if one of us has a date
with the undertaker which one will it be?
U can cry 4ever but u'll get no sympathy
This is the best day of my life
I've got 3 chains o' gold
And they will shine 4ever
They are the nucleus of my soul
Melt down, no, they will never
Give back the chains - if u don't u will die
Nothing must come between u and I
I've got 3 chains o' gold
And they will shine 4ever
If one of us has 2 go
U will go before me
If one of us has 2 go (3 chains o' gold)
U will go before me
(3 chains o' gold)
U will go before me, baby (they will shine 4ever)
Cuz I sho'nuff say u will
(3 chains o' gold)
(u will go before me)
(u will go before me)
(u will go before me)
(u will go before me)
I've got 3 chains o' gold
They gonna shine...
Forever, forever, forever
(3 chains o' gold)
