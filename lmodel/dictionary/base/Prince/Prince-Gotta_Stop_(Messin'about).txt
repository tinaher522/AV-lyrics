<song artist="Prince" title="Gotta_Stop_(Messin'about)">
Sittin' outside your door
About 2 break down
4th time this week
Somebody's come around
Who's it gonna be 2night?
Who's the lucky man?
Where U get the attitude
I'll never understand
Uh oh, here he comes now
So happy that he came
Hey, was it good, boy?
[Thoughts so over lame] 
What goes on inside your head
That makes U want 2 take them all 2 bed? 
Gotta stop, gotta, gotta stop messin' about
U know U gotta stop, gotta, gotta stop messin' about 
Oh oh yeah 
When I call U on the phone
U act so unconcerned (I wanna)
I wanna get U all alone (Ooh baby)
2 show U what I learned
U won't give me the time of day
U won't give me some time
U won't give me anything
God, U think U're 2 fine 
Can't U see all I want is a little time?
I've been playing with my toy so much I'm gonna go blind 
Gotta stop, gotta, gotta stop messin' about
U gotta stop, gotta, gotta stop messin' about (Ooh) 
Oh oh yeah
U gotta 
Gotta stop, gotta, gotta stop messin' about
U gotta stop, gotta, gotta stop messin' about {x2}
U do it 2 much
U gotta stop, gotta, gotta stop messin' about (Ooh)
Stop!
