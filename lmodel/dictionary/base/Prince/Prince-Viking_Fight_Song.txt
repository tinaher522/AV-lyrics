<song artist="Prince" title="Viking_Fight_Song">
The veil of the sky draws open
The roar of the chariots touch down
We r the ones who have now come again
And walk upon water like solid ground
As we approach the throne we won't bow down
This time we won't b denied
Raise every voice and let it b known
In the name of the purple and gold
We come in the name of the purple and gold
All of the odds r in r favor
No prediction 2 bold
We r the truth if the truth can b told
Long reign the purple and gold
The eyes say ready 4 battle
No need 4 sword in hand
