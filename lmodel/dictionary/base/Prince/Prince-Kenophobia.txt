<song artist="Prince" title="Kenophobia">
Welcome to the power of surrender
First things first
You must surrender your expectation
For those of you expected to get your Purple Rain on
You in the wrong house
See, we're not interested in what U know
But what you are willing to learn
Come on, y'all, uh!
Leave that blood alone
Don't you know dead blood kills interferons
NPG, are you ready?
Come on now, ow!
We 'bout to get deep tonight y'all
And that's the only way that we can rise up
Rainbow children, are you in here?
On the trombone, Mr. Greg Boyer
Warm it up, Greg, warm it up
Say Candy, what you think?
Candy, does he need a passport?
Can we let him stay?
I'll have to search him first, that's what
We loving it Greg, come on, y'all, whoo!
Say Maceo, they trying to describe funk
I don't know if you can describe if it ain't funky
Come on, Maceo, blow your horn
Y'all know who that is? Act like you know
Say, "Maceo blow your horn" (Maceo blow your horn) {x3}
Maceo, Maceo (Maceo, Maceo)
Ow, yeah yeah
Yeah
Don't hurt 'em, baby, don't hurt 'em
Hold on, hold on, yeah, come on y'all
Yeah yeah
If you drove up here in a Little Red Corvette
You might be surprised at what you gon' get
Portland, can you hear me, tonight?
Yeah yeah
Whoo
On the keyboards, the Master, Renato Neto
Oh, now I know he's gotta check his passport, whoo!
Let it rock
Ah, check it out
Yeah, watch me now
You've been randomly selected to be searched
Can I get any volunteers?
You must remove your shoes
We gon' get funky
On the drums, John Blackwell
Aw, you know we don't mean nobody no good
One, two, one, two, three
I got a question for ya
Is it better to give or to receive (It's better to give)
Alright then, then give up your seat to this person back here in the back
Come here, sister in the red
I'ma call your bluff
Can she have your seat?
Alright
Is it better to be a leader or a follower?
Better to be a leader or a follower? (A leader)
A leader? Too bad
Who thinks it's better to be a follower?
You?
Follow me
Have a seat right there
I'ma play the guitar for you, alright?
Can I get you anything {x2}
You cool?
Aw yeah!
