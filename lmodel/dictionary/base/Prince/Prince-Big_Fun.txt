Get freaky, let the head bob {x2} 
Get freaky, get freaky (I wonder if she..) 
Get freaky, let the head bob {x3} (Yeah) 
Get freaky, get freaky 
Psychedelic mama 
Tell me girl, what's your sign?

Make U feel so good 
I can't guarantee your safety 
It oughta be understood 
We could have big fun 
CHORUS: 
Get freaky, let the head bob {x2}

Oh yeah, it's like that

Come and dig the funky music

But next time we gonna get wild 
'cause baby, U know it never was a sin 2 
Have big fun
