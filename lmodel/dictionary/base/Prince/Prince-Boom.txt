<song artist="Prince" title="Boom">
What if another universe
Complete with sun and moon
An entire galaxy and whatâ€™s worse
You and I too soon
Find each other expanding beyond this dirty room
Butterscotch mountains
Sunshine
Run your fingers up and down the
Obelisk in the earth
Down 2 33 rmps where
The primordial gives birth
Or else we lie neck high you and eye
In one another's ooze
Volcano magic
Summer time
Everybody knows what happens
When you worship from afar
The ebb and flow of angels
Dancing around the star
And if the sunrise is still a question
The answer's in the dark
Celibate
Mushroom
Canopy
