(Please stop) {repeat sample in song} 
Tony, I'll spend the night with U on one condition 
What's that? 
U gotta have me home before dawn 
Uh oh 
My papa's a preacher 
Well... 
He despises sweet-talkin' fine-dressin' dudes like U 
Then that could be a problem 
Why if he knew I missed Sunday church 
On account of keepin' company with a brother like U 
Why he'd... 
What? 
He'd... I don't know what he'd do 
Shit 
But I surely don't wanna find out 
Well it's on 
(U g'on be naked) 
Goldnigga - we can turn this mutha out 
Goldnigga - tell me what U're all about 
Oh my God 
It is true 
Goldnigga's in the house, baby 
Ooh honey, one of us is gettin' saved 2night 
Then rescue me, baby 
Come here 
Damn 
Mmm, yeah, mmm 
Tony? 
What? 
Do U love me? 
U know it! 
Uh, yeah 
Would... would U marry me if I got in the family way? 
Son of Goldnigga? The sequel? 
U know that 2, baby 
Talk 2 me, baby 
Tell me who's in the motherf**kin' house 
Ahh, Goldnigga 
Speak the English, baby 
Tell me, what'cha gonna do with your life? 
What'cha mean? 
Can U really say that U'd help somebody? 
Wait a minute 
Or is this just a carnival ride? 
Oh shit, what the fu.., damn! 
What good is a school... 
But ah... 
If it's filled with fools? 
Shut up, shut up 
Goldnigga, it's so easy 2 love U 
But Goldnigga, who do U love?
