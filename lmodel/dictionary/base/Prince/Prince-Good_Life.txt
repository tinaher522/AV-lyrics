<song artist="Prince" title="Good_Life">
The good life, 1 day that's what I'll be livin'
Fantasy never hurt nobody, whatever chills the illin'
When the everyday gets on your last 1, give it up and go
2 the place in everyone's future, the good life - 1 day we'll know
(good life)
Everyday after school, u know where 2 find this brother
Uptown at every movie show, outta my life 2 another
That was the only thing that I wanted 2 do, that was my drug of choice
Left all the funny smellin' cigarettes 2 the american boys
"la dolce vita" was the knob that turned me on
Marcello mastroianni italian mac comin' on strong
He had all the honies, the kind from the magazines
Small waist, big - right!... biggest ones u've ever seen
The good life (good life), 1 day that's what I'll be livin'
Fantasy never hurt nobody, whatever chills the illin'
When the everyday gets on your last 1, give it up and go
2 the place in everyone's future, the good life - 1 day we'll know
1 day we'll know
(good life)
(good life)
Mama worked all night, went 2 school by day
Wanted 2 get her master degree so she could make a better way
Set examples 4 her babies that we'll never forget
That's where I guess my spirit comes from, eternally never met
Oh, the good life (good life), 1 day that's what I'll be livin'
Fantasy never hurt nobody, whatever chills the illin' (ooh, good life)
When the everyday gets on your last 1, give it up and go
2 the place in everyone's future, (the good life)
The good life - 1 day we'll know
(good life)
Good life
Good life
Good life (good life)
Hey, hey, hey!
Peace 2 the mother that knows

That the babies are the key 2 the world, key 2 the world
The battles of the future will be won
By those who teach those baby boys and girls
This is our plea 2 the brothers
Who are tired of the barely gettin' by, instead u should try
2 see your future map out your steps
And make sure no 1 dies
The good life (good), 1 day that's what I'll be livin'
Fantasy never hurt nobody, whatever chills the illin'
(1 drop of blood ain't worth forsaking your dreams)
When the everyday gets on your last 1, give it up and go
(music, sports, fashion, whatever)
2 the place in everyone's future, the good life - 1 day we'll know
(consolidate, think ahead, and cream, cream)
The good life (good life), 1 day that's what I'll be livin'
Fantasy never hurt nobody, whatever chills the illin' (hey yeah, good life)
When the everyday gets on your last 1, give it up and go (good life, oh)
2 the place in everyone's future, the good life - 1 day we'll know
New power generation (good life)
Tryin' 2 lead the good life (1 day we'll know)
Oh yeah, oh lord
Good life (good life)
The good life
Good life (good life)
The good life (good life)
Good life (good life), 1 day that's what I'll be livin'
Fantasy never hurt nobody, whatever chills the illin'
When the everyday gets on your last 1, give it up and go
2 the place in everyone's future, the good life - 1 day we'll know
(good life)
Good life {x4}
Good life (good life)
Good life (good life)
The good life (good life) {x3}
1 day we'll know!
