<song artist="Prince" title="Xenophobia">
Welcome 2 the power of surrender
First things first
U must surrender your expectation
4 those of U expected 2 get your Purple Rain on
U in the wrong house
See, we're not interested in what U know
But what U are willing 2 learn
Come on, y'all, uh!
Leave that blood alone
Don't U know dead blood kills interferons
NPG, are U ready?
Come on now, ow!
We 'bout 2 get deep 2night y'all
And that's the only way that we can rise up
Rainbow children, are U in here?
On the trombone, Mr. Greg Boyer
Warm it up, Greg, warm it up
Say Candy, what U think?
Candy, does he need a passport?
Can we let him stay?
I'll have 2 search him first, that's what
We loving it Greg, come on, y'all, whoo!
Say Maceo, they trying to describe funk
I don't know if U can describe if it ain't funky
Come on, Maceo, blow your horn
Y'all know who that is? Act like U know
Say, "Maceo blow your horn" (Maceo blow your horn) {x3}
Maceo, Maceo (Maceo, Maceo)
Ow, yeah yeah
Yeah
Don't hurt 'em, baby, don't hurt 'em
Hold on, hold on, yeah, come on y'all
Yeah yeah
If U drove up here in a Little Red Corvette
U might be surprised at what U gon' get

Portland, can U hear me, 2night?
Yeah yeah
Whoo
On the keyboards, the Master, Renato Neto
Oh, now I know he's gotta check his passport, whoo!
Let it rock
Ah, check it out
Yeah, watch me now
U've been randomly selected to be searched
Can I get any volunteers?
U must remove your shoes
We gon' get funky
On the drums, John Blackwell
Aw, U know we don't mean nobody no good
1, 2, 1, 2, 3
I got a question 4 ya
Is it better 2 give or 2 receive (It's better 2 give)
Alright then, then give up your seat 2 this person back here in the back
Come here, sister in the red
I'ma call your bluff
Can she have your seat?
Alright
Is it better 2 be a leader or a follower?
Better 2 be a leader or a follower? (A leader)
A leader? 2 bad
Who thinks it's better 2 be a follower?
U?
Follow me
Have a seat right there
I'ma play the guitar 4 U, alright?
Can I get U anything {x2}
U cool?
Aw yeah!
