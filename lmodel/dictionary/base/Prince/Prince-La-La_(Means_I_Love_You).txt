<song artist="Prince" title="La-La_(Means_I_Love_You)">
Hey girl, I bet you didn't know I had both eyes on you
It's true
And you know what? I seen all those other guys to
Baby, frankly, I don't give a damn
Many guys have come to you
With a line that wasn't true
And you'd pass 'em by (Pass them by)
Though you're in the center ring
And their lines don't mean a thing
Why don't you let me try? (Let me try)
Now I don't wear a diamond ring
I don't even know a song to sing
All I know is
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
means I love you, oh baby
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la means I love you
If I ever saw a girl
That I needed in this world
You are the one for me
Let me hold you in my arms
Gonna fill you with my charms
I'm sure that you will see (you will see)
The things I am sayin' are true
And the way I wanna explain them to you
Baby, can you listen to me?
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
means I love U, oh baby
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la,
la means I love you, yeah
So there, the book is open
What you wanna do?
Can you do-o-o me, baby, like I wanna do you?
Come here, let me hold you in my arms
Let me fill you with my charms
The things I am sayin' are true
And the way I explain them to you
Yes, to you!
(La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
means I love you) repeat in BG
(La, la, la, la, la (means) I
love you) I love you, I really,
Really love you
Oh listen to me, baby
Oh, I love you, I love ya, love ya
Oh, take my hand, girl
You gotta understand
I wanna be, I wanna be, I wanna be your man
You know where to find me when you make up that mind
