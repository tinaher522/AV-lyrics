<song artist="Prince" title="Nothing_Compares_2_U">
Lead voice by Prince &amp; Rosie Gaines
Prince: It's been 7 hours and 13 days
Since u took your love away
I go out every night and sleep all day
Since u took your love away
Rosie: Since you've been gone I can do whatever I want
I can see who ever I choose
Eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant, oh yeah
But nothing, nothing can take away these blues
P &amp; R: Nothing Compares, Nothing Compares 2 u
Rosie: Oh baby
Prince: It's been so lonely without u here
I'm like a bird without a song
Nothing can stop this lonely rain from falling
Tell me baby, where did I go wrong?
Rosie: Oh baby
I can put my arms around every boy I see, oh yeah
But they only remind me of u
Prince: All my dames remind me of u too girl, oh yeah
Rosie: I went 2 the doctor, guess what he told me
Prince: What'd he tell u?
Rosie: Guess what he told me
Prince: I'm listening
Rosie: He said, "Rosie,"
Prince: What?
Rosie: "Try to have fun no matter what u do"
Prince: U wanna tell me why?
Rosie: He's a fool
P &amp; R: Nothing Compares (No), Nothing Compares 2 u
Rosie: Ooh, baby
Prince: Tenor man, play it for me
Prince: All the flowers that u planted, sugar
In the backyard All died when u went away
Rosie: Ooh baby, I know that living with me baby 
Is sometimes hard, sometimes hard
But I'm willing, I'm willing 2 give it one more try
Prince: One more try
Rosie: Please do you know why, do you know why
P &amp; R: Nothing compares (No), Nothing Compares 2 u
Rosie: Oh, baby
Prince: Everytime I say...
P &amp; R: Nothing compares (No), Nothing compares 2 u
Prince: Rosie Gaines
