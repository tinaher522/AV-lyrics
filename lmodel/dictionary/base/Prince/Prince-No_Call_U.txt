<song artist="Prince" title="No_Call_U">
Girl, I'm goin' crazy, I'm lonely and I need your kiss
My body wants 2 call U but my ego says I got 2 resist
Come and stop it if U want 2 but I ain't playin' second 2 none
U got 2 put your arms around me and tell me I'm the only 1
No call U, U call me (Ooh wee)
If love is true, I will see
Come on, mama
No call U, U call me
If love is true, I will see
No call U, U call me
If love is true, I will see
No call U, U call me
If love is true, I... I... I will see
Yeah! (No call U)
No call U, U call me
If love is true, I will see
No call U, U call me
If love is true, I...
Alright
Yeah
No call U, U call me
Mama, I know U want 2
But I won't call U, U will have 2 call me
Ooh wee, yeah
U... U call me
I called U in the summer
Whenever I'd call your ass up on the phone (No call U, U call me)
Yeah
Yeah, ooh!
