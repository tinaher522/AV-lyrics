<song artist="Prince" title="When_You_Love_Somebody">
I was the one sleepin' all alone
When you were at the party
I was the one waitin' by the phone
When you were with somebody
Now here you come again with your heart in your hands
Confessin' all of your sins, yeah
The same tired line that I've heard a dozen times
But still I've got to give in
[Chorus:]
Cuz when you love somebody
Every now and then it might rain
When you love somebody
With every sun shower there's pain
Whenever something's lost, something's gained
When you love somebody
When you love someone
You were the one lookin' for some action
I was just lookin' for you
"Who needs love when you got protection"
Quote, quote our point of view
All my partners say that I need to dismiss ya
Until they see you smile (Such a pretty smile)
All them fools are buggin' cuz they just want your lovin'
In the backseat, huh, for a little while (But I don't care)
[Chorus]
(When you love somebody)
(Might rain)
Yeah, yea
Check me out on the floor
So what, you got me open
Yeah, do your dance
But I'm the one you're dancin' for
And you know this
Round and round, don't stop it
And you know this, yeah, yeah
Up and down, you got it
Cuz when you love somebody (When you love somebody)
Every now and then it might rain (Now and then it might rain)
When you love somebody
With every sun shower there's pain
(Baby, a little pain, a little pain, yeah)
Whenever something's lost, something's gained
(Every now and then you got to think about what you gain) (Think you don't?)
When you love somebody (Yeah) (When you love somebody)
Every now and then it might rain (Might rain)
When you love somebody (Pourin' down, down on me)
With every sun shower there's pain (Come on, wet me rain)
Whenever something's lost, something's gained (Something's
Gained)
When you love somebody, yeah
When you love somebody {x7}
(So sweet)
(It's complete)
Well (So nice)
(It's paradise)
Round and round, don't stop it
Round and round, don't stop the pounds
Cuz a brutha gettin' down here lately
Freedom agrees with yous all, you see
In a state of mind that's weightless
See, on the quantum tip I flipped on the notion
When the Adam split, we got Eve
Duality's now a groupie with a backstage pass
And they ain't gonna leave till they get some
From grace we fall
Referring to the objects on the wall
I'd picture my hat, my coat, my balls
Around and round (Round and round) {x2}
Huh, don't stop the pounds (Don't stop the pounds)
Yeah, cuz a brutha gettin' down here lately
Mm
