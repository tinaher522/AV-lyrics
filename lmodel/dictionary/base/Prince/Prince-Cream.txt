<song artist="Prince" title="Cream">
This is it
It's time for you to go to the wire
You will hit
'Cause you got the burnin' desire
It's your time (time)
You got the horn so why don't you blow it?
You are fine (fine)
You're filthy cute and baby you know it, ooh
Cream, get on top
Cream, you will cop
Cream, don't you stop
Cream, sh-boogie bop
You're so good
Baby, there ain't nobody better (ain't nobody better)
So you should
Never ever go by the letter (never ever)
You're so cool (cool)
Everything you do is success
Ooh, make the rules (rules)
Then break them all 'cause you are the best 
Yes you are
Cream, get on top
Cream, you will cop
Cream, don't you stop
Cream, sh-boogie bop
Look up in the air, it's your guitar
Do your dance
Why should you wait any longer?
Take your chance
It could only make you stronger
It's your time (it's your time)
You got the horn so why don't you blow it? (go on and blow it)
You're so fine (you're so fine)
You're filthy cute and baby you know it (you know it)
(And you know it, come on)
Cream, get on top
Cream, you will cop
Cream, don't you ever stop
Cream, sh-boogie bop
Cream
Cream
Cream, sh-boogie bop
Cream
Cream, right there
Cream (don't you stop)
(Cream) Sh-boogie bop
(Boogie)
Cream, sh-boogie bop
