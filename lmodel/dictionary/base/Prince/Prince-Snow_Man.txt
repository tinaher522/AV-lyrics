Snow Man  - PRINCE
Christmas in Belgium was different 
Than the ones spent in L.A. 
The Christmas I got no presents 
Still me and my brother played 
Near the ocean makin' the snow man 
On his face we were makin' a smile 
Cuz just like a daddy 
The snow man had style 
CHORUS: 
Snow man, snow man 
Another Christmas gone 
I got a chess game this time 
A bishop takes the pawn 
Sometimes I wanna go back where 
The ocean swallows the shore 
I could still see him smiling 
When my snow man is no more, no more 
Winter seldom passing 
Where the memory doesn't sway 
2 the smell of a Christmas dinner 
Shared the family way (Shared in the family way) 
Everything seems so perfect 
That nothing would dare go wrong 
But tears come with the summer 
So long, so long (So long) 
CHORUS 
Snow man 
I look at my hands and I wonder 
Will they ever make anyone smile 
The way the snow man made me 
CHORUS 
(Snow man) {repeat till end}
