<song artist="Prince" title="$">
Here she come, the most popular girl
In the whole wide world today
You don't know if she would 
But what's good if she'd some and look your way
You're standing over there tryin' to be gangsta coppin' your favorite lean
You give her the head nod
Oh my God you're the craziest thing
She's ever seen but your
Dancing
And she's loving you all night long
In your little world she's your best girl
It's all money
Ain't nothing wrong
Your dancing and she's loving you all night long
Funky dolla bill it's real you all
Easy come, easy gone
Where you go everybody wanna know
So they can put it in a magazine
Next to the ad for the latest fad
In black hair care, Vaseline
With this car these rims this grill you'll be
The illest on the scene
Whatever whatever all you need is your music
And you'll b a party machine and you'll be
Funky dolla bill it's real you all
Easy come, easy gone
How many times you look for happy
And you never see the rich folks there?
But if the DJ really dropped a needle all the true players just don't care
When all the news just gimme the blues and make you wanna pop a pill
What difference does it make who got's the most bank, it's just ink and
Chlorophyll
Funky dolla bill it's real you all
Easy come, easy gone
Pawns aside who's the king the two and four
Wit hot sauce from the bay to Baltimore
Take your woman for she hit the front door
And whoop your whole crew 'cause they fat and slow
Dancing loving you all night long
It's all money ain't nothing wrong
Dancing loving you all night long
Easy come easy gone
