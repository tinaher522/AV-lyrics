<song artist="Prince" title="The_Question_Of_U">
So what is the answer 2 the question of u
what do I look 4, what shall I do?
Which way do I turn when I'm feeling lost?
if I sell my soul, now what will it cost?
Must I become naked? No image at all?
Shall I remain upright? Or get down and crawl?
All of the questions in my life will be answered
when I decide which road 2 choose
what is the answer 2 the question of u?
u.
