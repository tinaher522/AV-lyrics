Mayte, darling, I'm diggin' your set, but a..
I think we need 2 leave something 4 the babies of the New Power Generation
What do U think?
Cool, what do U wanna do?
However much U want
Get up then, boy!
Well, well
How much can U get if U just put your mind 2 it?
However much U want
How much can U gain if U don't struggle 2 get through it?
However much U need
How strong is your faith if U don't take time 2 renew it?
However much U care
Listen now, make haste this is the time U got 2 do it
However much U dare
CHORUS:
However much U want
Love will give U how much U need
However much U care
Unlock your mind and go there
However much U want
There's a brand new world deep inside your soul
Love is there
Love is there if U dare 2 go
Oh
Hear me..
If U listen 2 your feelings, they'll keep getting stronger
However much U want
What is life if U don't find a way 2 make it longer?
However much U need
How many times will U get burned before U stop the fire?
However much U care
Come dive into this waterfall of forgiveness and desire
However much U dare
CHORUS
It don't matter when U come, don't matter who sold ya
All that matters is that U go there once and let it hold ya
Deep inside it's arms U'll realize that if U come again
U'll want 2 come again and again and again and a..
How much can U get if U just put your mind 2 it?
How much can U gain if U don't struggle 2 get through it?
How strong is your faith if U don't take time 2 renew it?
Listen now, make haste this is the time U gotta, gotta, gotta do it
CHORUS {x2}
Love is there {x4}
However much U want
