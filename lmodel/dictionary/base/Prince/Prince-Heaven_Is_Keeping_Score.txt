<song artist="Prince" title="Heaven_Is_Keeping_Score">
You'll be fine, cause you're mine.
We can withstand the test of time.
It's all or nothing, everything we do.
Even when I can't be, can't be with you. 
It doesn't mean you're any farther away.
Just means we're still prisoners. 
Not entirely free.
There's a new age dawning.
Slowly opening Heaven's door.
Contrary to rumor, Heaven is keeping score.
The New Power Generation have just taken control
