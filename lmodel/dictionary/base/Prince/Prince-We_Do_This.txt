<song artist="Prince" title="We_Do_This">
"Blow your horn, Maceo!" 
Say it (Blow your horn, Maceo {repeated by audience})
Come on 
Whatcha got on your feet, some Jordans?
Just the drums
Maceo, hit me now!
It would be ludicrous 2 think that we are new 2 this
We do this, this is what we do
It would be ludicrous 2 think that we are new 2 this
We do do this, it's what we do
It would be ludicrous 2 think that we are new 2 this
We do this, this is what we do
It would be ludicrous 2 think that we are new 2 this
We do this
It would be absurd 2 think U've never heard of this
Talkin' shhh..., every word the turd of it
It would be ludicrous, we are new 2 this
We do this, this is what we...
It would be ludicrous 2 think that we are new 2 this
We do this, this is what we do
It would be ludicrous 2 think that we are new 2 this
We do this
How y'all doing in here?
How y'all doing up in here?
(...) excepting (...) 2 this
Oh still U can't reap what U missed
U couldn't resist and now U're pissed
And when it's over, it ain't over
It ain't over {repeated}
It's over
