<song artist="Prince" title="Rebirth_Of_The_Flesh">
Ooh yeah, alright
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Kick drum pounds on the 2 and 4
All the party people get on the floor
We got the beat U're looking 4
The rebirth of the flesh is at your door (Let it in y'all!)
It's a brand new day
3 2 funk ain't in our way (No no no)
It ain't about the money, we just wanna play
The rebirth of the flesh is here 2day (Is here 2 stay)
La la la la la la, souli-a-colia (Hey)
The rebirth of the flesh, it's all over U
We are the fathers of a new boogie cool
Guaranteed 2 rock U cuz we're from the old school
We are here, where are U?
Everybody jam 2 the new boogie blues (Check it out!)
It's a brand new day (Wooo!)
3 2 funk ain't in our way (No)
It ain't about the money, we just wanna play
The rebirth of the flesh is here 2day - now everybody say
La la la la la la, souli-a-colia (Hey)
We are here, where are U?
Everybody jam 2 the new boogie cool
La la la la la la, souli-a-colia (Hey)
We are here, where are U?
Everybody jam 2 the new boogie cool (Wooo!)
Souli-a-colia (Hey)
Souli-a-colia (Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
Think about your nigga, the 1 that works so hard (Hey)
What's his is his, what's yours is yours
Unless U beat him at a game of cards (Hey)
This ain't cards, motherfucker!
This is life, this is real
We are here, where are U?
Everybody jam 2 the new boogie cool
Come on
We are here, where are U?
Everybody jam 2 the new boogie cool
La la la la la la, souli-a-colia (Hey)
We are here, where are U?
Everybody jam 2 the new boogie cool
La la la la la la, souli-a-colia (Hey)
We are here, where are U?
Everybody jam 2 the new boogie cool
Everybody jam 2 the new boogie cool
