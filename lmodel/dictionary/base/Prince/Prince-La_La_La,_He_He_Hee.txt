Oh, oh, oh, oh! {represents dog barks}
I am a dog outside your door
I have been there since a quarter 2 4
U are a cat looking intense
I bite your leg in self-defense 
Say it! Oh, oh, oh, oh!
Say it! Oh, oh, oh, oh! 
Get out my tree grinnin' at me
Licking your tail like it's cream
Strokin' your whiskers, causing a scene
That's not the way 2 me (the way 2 me) 
Say it! Oh, oh, oh, oh!
Say it! Oh, oh, oh, oh! 
CHORUS:
And the doggies say 2 the kitty
La, la, la, he, he, hee
I want U, U want me
Oh, how sexy it will be
If we ever get 2gether in my tree 
Say it! Oh, oh, oh, oh!
Say it! Oh, oh, oh, oh! 
Hey little pussy, U sure look sweet
Knockin' me off of my 4 feet
Sure do wish dogs could climb (I wish, I wish)
Then we could have a funky good time 
Say it! Oh, oh, oh, oh!
Say it again! Oh, oh, oh, oh! 
Why U wink at me? I don't really see
Nasty little cat up, up in a tree
Is it really worth the one night of fun?
U've got 9 lives, I've only got one! 
Say it! Oh, oh, oh, oh! 
CHORUS 
I'm picking up your scent {fade out}
U...
