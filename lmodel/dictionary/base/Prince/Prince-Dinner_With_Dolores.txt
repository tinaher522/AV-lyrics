Dinner with delores
Must be some kind of sin
Like a brontosaurus
She was packin' it in
The first night we dined
And by the next time
This girl was eatin' all but the tip
And by the stroke of midnight
She wanted some more (more)
Showin' dirty movies
Like some kind of whore
But she was wastin' her time
'cause there wasn't a line
That would make me come 'round her door
Dinner with delores
Must be some kind of sin
Her bell's just a-broken (bell's just broken)
Since 1984
(dancin') dancin' like a white girl (white girl)

On disco dirty floors
Damn, delores, pick another subject please
Introduce the carpet 2 something other than your knees
Like a real confession
No one could be more made up than u
Nothin's left 4 guessin'
What a shame
(boo hoo) boo hoo
(delores)
(delores)
I'd call u a friend
But it must be a sin
And I've run out of cheeks 2 turn
Dinner with delores
No more
That's the end
