<song artist="Prince" title="You_Got_The_Look">
Here we are folks, the dream we all dream of
Boy versus girl in the World Series of love
Tell me, have you got the look?
You walked in, I woke up
I've never seen a pretty girl look so tough
Baby, you got that look
Color you peach and black
Color me takin' aback
Crucial, I think I want ya
You've got the look, you've got the hook
Sho'nuff do be cookin', in my book
Your face is jammin', your body's heck-a-slammin'
If love is good, let's get to rammin'
You got the look, you got the look
Looka here
You got the look
(You got the look)
You musta took
(You musta took)
A whole hour
Just to make up your face, baby
Closin' time, ugly lights
Everybody's inspected
(Everybody's inspected)
But you are a natural beauty unaffected
(Unaffected)
Did I say an hour? My face is red
I stand corrected
(I stand corrected)
You've got the look
(You've got the look)
You sho'nuff do be cookin' in my book
(Slammin')
Your face is jammin', your body's heck-a-slammin'
If love is good, let's get to rammin'
You got the look, you got the look
There's no jokin you well, here we are
Ladies and gentlemen the dream we all dream of
(Oh, please)
Boy versus girl in the World Series of love
Slammin'
You walked in, I woke up
(I walked in, you woke up)
I never seen such a pretty girl look so tough
Baby, you got that look
(Baby you got that look)
Color you peach and black
Color me takin' aback, baby
Crucial, I think I wantcha
You've got the look, you've got the hook
You sho'nuff do be cookin' in my book
Your face is jammin', your body's heck-a-slammin'
If your love is good, let's get to rammin' now
You got the look, you got the look
Here we are folks
The dream we all dream of
You got the look
You got the look
You got the look
You got the look
You got the look
