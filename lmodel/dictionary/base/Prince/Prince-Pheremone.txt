<song artist="Prince" title="Pheremone">
Come
Lie down beneath my shadow
Lie down beneath my shadow with great delight
And your feel will be sweet to me
Come
My left hand under your head
While my right embraces time
Therein, my virgin, love's wine
L is for lust, O is for obsession
V is for the vast way you envelop my site
This is crazy, this is crazy
I could die from the pheromone
I can see the castle, I can see the throne
I can see the beloved and she's not alone
But it's cool like that
'Cuz I'll be diggin' her just the same
I can see the curtain wrestled from the wall
I can see her hands tied, I can see it all
He pulls a gat
This is how they play the game
And I'm 'round the the back
'Cuz curiosity it knows no shame
Pheromone, rush over me like an ocean
Pheromone, controllin' my every motion
Pheromone, I'm helpless as a pet
Pheromone, when your body's wet
(Body's wet, body's wet, body's wet)
I can feel the tension through the crack in the door
He begs for love, while she's disgusted more
And I'm on fire
'Cause I never seen her nude before
I wanna save her, I want to watch
(Save her)
(Watch)
All my vital signs go up a couple of notches
When he unties her
And she runs to the open door
He trips and grinds her
(Grinds her)
Right there all on the floor
(On the floor)
She so close I can touch her
(Touch her)
Pheromone, rush over me like an ocean
Pheromone, controllin' my every motion
Pheromone, I'm helpless as a pet
Pheromone, when your body's wet
(Body's wet, body's wet, body's wet)
Her eyes are closed but there's no penetration
He just makes her point the pistol to his nose
While he masturbates and now I see a tear
Heading down towards her smile
What happens next
It all depends upon your style
(Oh, this is crazy baby)
Pheromone, rush over me like an ocean
(Pheromone)
Pheromone, controllin' my every motion
(Pheromone)
Pheromone, I'm helpless as a pet
Pheromone, when your body's wet
(Pheromone)
(Body's wet)
Pheromone, rush over me like an ocean
Pheromone, controllin' my every motion
I don't really wanna go crazy but I'm helpless as a pet
When I see your naked body's wet
(When your body's wet,body's wet)
(Pheromone)
When I see your naked body's wet
(Pheromone)
When I see your naked body's wet
(Body's wet, body's wet)
(Pheromone)
But I'm helpless as a pet
(Pheromone)
When I see your naked baby, when your body's wet
(Body's wet, body's wet, body's wet)
Pheromone
Pheromone
Pheromone
Pheromone
