<song artist="Prince" title="Kept_Woman">
I was only 17 when he saw me
The apple of my daddy's eye
Cute but not jaded my hair in two braids
He looked at me and just said hi
Was it his cologne or the style of his hair?
They told me I should stay away and not go there
Sometimes I'm all alone and don't see him
I wish it was different but I don't care
I'm a kept woman, he don't see nobody but me
We got a pretty little house and only me and him got the key
A kept woman, sometimes I don't know why
A kept woman, sometimes I cry
He likes it when I dance for no reason
He likes it when I dance
But he doesn't like it when I raise my voice to him
I try to stop but I can't
Was it his cologne or the style of his hair?
I don't know how but he took me there
And now I hug my pillow more nights than not
It's crazy but the butterflies just don't stop
'Cause I'm a kept woman, he don't see nobody but me
We got a pretty little house and only me and him got the key
A kept woman, sometimes I don't know why
A kept woman, sometimes I cry
Kept woman, kept woman, he's the hotness in my fire
I give him anything he desires
It may sound crazy but it suits me fine
'Cause ain't nobody ever take away what's mine
I'm a kept woman 'cause he's every single thing I need
Kept woman, everything in between
Don't you know that I'm a kept woman?
He loves me like no other
I'm a kept woman and I'm his queen
Yes I am, yes I am and I don't care, no
Kept woman, I don't care
Kept woman, I don't care
Kept woman, I don't care
