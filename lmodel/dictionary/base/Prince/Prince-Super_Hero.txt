<song artist="Prince" title="Super_Hero">
Give us what U give your brothers then U'll understand
I won't be your super hero till U give us all U can
Now! (x2)
(Chorus:)
I will be your super hero
But U must understand
If I'm 2 be your super hero
U must give me half a chance
Listen 2 my band
I am born unto poverty and fear
I am scorned and yet I hold back my tears
There's so much I can and will and wanna do
But I cannot until I get through 2 U
(Chorus)
(U can lead them)
Give us what U give your brothers then U'll understand
(That) I won't be your super hero till U give us all U can
(Watch it!)
(Chorus)
I will be your super hero
Oh, U must understand
I will be your super hero
If U give me half a chance
Listen 2 my band (Listen 2 my band)
I will be your super hero (x4)
Listen 2 my band
Woo!
(Yeah) (4:20 mark)
Turn down the house lights (6:21 mark)
(Hey, alright!) (x4)
(Go! Go! Go! ...)
Super hero going "Outa Space" (x4)
Told y'all I'm g'on kick that ass!
