<song artist="Prince" title="Get_Wild">
Get wild! Ah!
Get wild! Ooh, ooh, baby!
Get wild! {x4}
When U're sick of that 9 2 5
And U're ready 2 come alive
When U look both high and low
And U can't find a trumpet that blows
Come on baby (Aw shucks!), where the good times never die
Come on baby (Aw shucks!), where the damsels good and fly
Come on baby, U can shake your funky monkey 'til it cry
Polyvinyl acetate will keep your monkey high
If U wanna get real freaky, now's the time 2 try (Come on y'all)
CHORUS:
Get wild! - Everybody up in the place
Get wild! - It don't matter what sex or race
Get wild! - All U nasty girls and boys
If U wanna get wild, say yeah (Yeah!) - Make some noise!
When U want 2 get in the groove
But the music don't make U move
Hip the DJ 2 a new CD
Anything by the N.P.G.
Come on baby (Aw shucks!), where the good times never die
Come on baby (Aw shucks!), where the damsels good and fly
Come on baby, U can shake your funky monkey 'til it cry
Polyvinyl acetate will keep your monkey high
If U wanna get real freaky, now's the time 2 try (Come on y'all)
CHORUS
Get wild!
Like U know U need 2
Pick a funky outfit short and see through
Versace got it going on in the gold mesh
Why don't U try it on 2 night when U get dressed?
Get Wild's the only aroma that my nose will see (Get wild!)
Why don't U spray a little where U think I'm gonna be?
And U know, U know what shoes 2 wear
The ones so high U're scared
Ououo, peligro que aqui yo vengo! {Oh oh, danger 4 here I come!}
(Get wild!)
When U can't find the G 2 your GO
Even charged, your battery's low
When the smoke's 2 thick 2 blow
There's a brand new high we know
Come on baby (Aw shucks!), where the good times never die
Come on baby (Aw shucks!), where the damsels good and fly
Come on baby, U can shake your funky monkey 'til it cry
Polyvinyl acetate will keep your monkey high
If U wanna get real freaky, now's the time 2 try (Come on y'all)
Get wild! - Everybody up in the place, yes
Get wild! - It don't matter what sex or race
Get wild! - All U nasty girls and boys (Get wild!)
If U wanna get wild, say yeah (Yeah!) - Make some noise!
Get wild! (Shake it!)
Shake your money maker
Get wild! (Shake it!)
Shake your money maker
Get wild! (Shake it!) (Shake it!)
Shake your money maker
Get wild!
(Get, get ...)
Come on, get wild!
