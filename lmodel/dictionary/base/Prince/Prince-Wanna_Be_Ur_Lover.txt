<song artist="Prince" title="Wanna_Be_Ur_Lover">
Um, yeah, look out...
I ain't got no money
I ain't like those other guys you hang around
It's kinda funny, yeah
They always seem to let you down
And I get discouraged, yes you do baby
Cuz I never see you anymore
I need your love baby, well, ooh
That's all I'm living for, ooh ooh ooh, now
Didn't wanna pressure you, baby, sing it y'all
(All I ever wanted to do)
I wanna be your...(lover) yeah
I wanna be the only one that makes you come...(Running)
I wanna be your...(Lover)
Wanna turn you on, turn you out
All night long, make you shout...(aw lover) "Yeah, yeah!"
Wanna be the only one you come for
