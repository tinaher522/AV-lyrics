<song artist="Prince" title="Immersion">
Come in
Very adept in the art of healin'
A voice spoke up to her sayin' come in
She's lost for words describin' the feelin'
Whatever it is it will never end, no
Very adept in the art of listenin'
She studied everythin' she needed to know
Her dreams now turned to the water glistenin'
And the words come in and go, come in and go
To a place where time it has no meanin'
And a space where there are no more walls
Very adept in the art of receivin'
She finally got the call
Come in, come in, go
Immersion, immersion
Very adept in the art of releasin'
She let all of her inhibitions go
With the unexpected shock of a bee sting
She got pulled into the future and into the new world
Into the new world, into the new world
Into the new world, into the new world
Into the new world, into the new world
Into the new world, into the new world
Welcome to the place much faster than time
The true reality, where only peace you'll find
Come in, come in, go
Immersion, immersion, immersion
Go
