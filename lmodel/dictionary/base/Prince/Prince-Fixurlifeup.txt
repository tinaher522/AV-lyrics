<song artist="Prince" title="Fixurlifeup">
Tell me how some people walk in the sun
While others just walk in the dark
Looking at the world through a barrel of a gun
Hands behind their back in a parked car
In America you might fair better
In London you're sure to be toast
You'll always get the dream that you deserve
From what you value the most
You need to fix your life up
Fix your life up
Fix it up
Go with the guitar is twelve times better than another crazy fan of voice
Trying to be a star
When you're just another brick in a misogynistic world, the noise
When the leaders learn how to follow
And then all the people lead
Instead of everybody getting what they want
They can get what they need
You need to fix your life up
Alright
Fix your life up
Fix your life up
Don't worry about what the crowd does
Just worry about being good at what you love
Don't make this complicated
You know it's true
Don't make us put somebody else in for you
