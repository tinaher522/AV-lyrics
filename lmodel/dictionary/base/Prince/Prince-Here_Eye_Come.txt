<song artist="Prince" title="Here_Eye_Come">
Anticipation for what's to come
It's been a long time since I've been with anyone
Careful, a woman's got to be in this day and age
That's why I was so elated when I got your page
Just thinkin' 'bout what we used to do
Make me wanna, make me wanna take a shower
And just lose myself in a fantasy
Your hands all over me, but for now I will have to do
Here I, here I, here I come
Here I, here I, here I come
Motivation, that's what you are to me
And I can just think about you babe and get weak in the knees
No seriously I'm sittin' down right now
On the floor of the shower just, wow
Don't ever stop what you're doin'
Don't ever stop what you're doin'
Oh, I feel like that dirty blonde girl in '9 Â½ Weeks'
A minute goes just like an hour
And the water pours all over me in the shower
Here I, here I, here I come
Here I, here I, here I come
Dear diary, the one in my mind
Electric rush inside me is goin' crazy
I gotta find a way to make it stop
If I don't I'm gonna pop like a cork on a bottle of Chardonnay
In the air then I drop down to my knees
Here I, here I, here I come
Here I, here I, here I come
It's been a long time since I've been with anyone
Here I, here I, here I come
Here I, here I, here I, here I come, here I come
Here I come
Here I, here I, here I come
Here I, here I, here I come, here I come
