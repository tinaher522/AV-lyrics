<song artist="Prince" title="Wanna_B_Ur_Lover">
Um, yeah, look out... 
I ain't got no money 
I ain't like those other guys U hang around 
It's kinda funny, yeah
They always seem 2 let U down
And I get discouraged, yes U do baby
'cause I never see U anymore 
I need your love baby, well, ooh
That's all I'm living 4, ooh ooh ooh, now
Didn't wanna pressure U, baby, sing it y'all
(All I ever wanted to do)
I wanna be your... (lover) yeah 
I wanna be the only one that makes U come... (Running)
I wanna be your... (Lover)
Wanna turn U on, turn U out 
All night long, make U shout... (aw lover) "Yeah, yeah!"
