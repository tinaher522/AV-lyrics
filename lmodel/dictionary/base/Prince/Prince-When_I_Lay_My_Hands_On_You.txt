<song artist="Prince" title="When_I_Lay_My_Hands_On_You">
The message you're about to hear is not meant for transmission 
Should only be accessed in the privacy of your mind 
Words are intense so my dear if you dare to listen 
Take off your clothes
And Meet me between the lines 
Are you ready for the touch that makes you go insane 
Breast to lips to cheek to mane
I'll pull your hair, you'll feel no pain 
Are you ready for the only forever we'll both obtain 
The only joy in this forsaken game
You'll feel ashamed and ordained 
When I lay my hands on you 
The touch you're about to feel is the one you've been wishin' for 
It's been here like an echo inside your space and time 
It's about to get freaky cause the places that I'll be kissin' 
Are the places that no other man could ever find 
Oh wind up ready for...
The touch that makes you go insane 
Breast to lips to cheek to mane
I'll pull your hair, you'll feel no pain 
Are you ready for the only forever we'll both obtain 
The only joy in this forsaken game (God forbid) 
You'll feel ashamed and ordained (God forbid)
When I lay my hands on you 
Nobody knows
Like God knows
Where the deepest part of your river flows 
Snap Snap
Undo these nylon hose
Around your thigh my finger goes slowly 
Like a cat tip-toes
Until I reach the cat's nose 
I will touch thee in the softest manner
Like Europa in the hands of Santana 
Are you ready for the touch that makes you go insane 
Breast to lips to cheek to mane
I'll pull your hair, you'll feel no pain 
Are you ready for the only forever we'll both obtain 
The only joy in this forsaken game
You'll feel ashamed and ordained 
When I lay my hands on you
When I lay my hands on you
