<song artist="Prince" title="Fury">
U must have heard it on the news this morning
Congratulations, a new star is born
Sun 2 shadow, rose 2 a thorn
But there ain't no fury like a woman scorned
Y'all musta dug it when U did your thang
It's like the song everybody wanna sang
When the music's over your ears'll ring
With a voice that says "Queen got no king"
Got no king, (No, she don't)
He got a message sayin' U tried 2 reach him on the phone
He didn't wanna answer cuz he's so afraid
U'll probably tell him just 2 leave U alone
U must have heard he got another band
They're makin' money, they're makin' plans
U feel left out, but U need 2 understand
Word on the street - he's still your man
He's still your man, he's still your man, girl
(Look out, look out) Look out here comes your rainy day
Now U think U got a good reason 2 say
Everything that's in your heart, come what may
Even though his might get broken
Who's the guilty 1, (who's the guilty 1) when there ain't no judge and jury?
Shadow 2 the sun (shadow 2 the sun), next 2 the 1 (next 2 the 1)
Hell ain't got no fury
Will the roses the dead keep sending
Repair the heart in need of mending?
Will this song have a happy ending?
Only the woman knows, only she knows
2 sides 2 every story
One man's gloom is another man's glory
Sun 2 a shadow (shadow), rose 2 a thorn (rose 2 a thorn)
There ain't no fury like a woman scorned
Oh no, ain't no fury like a woman scorned {x2} (Oh no)
No fury like a woman scorned
{laughter}
