<song artist="Prince" title="Forever_In_My_Live">
La da da da da da da da
La da da da da da da da
There comes a time, in every man's life
When he get's tired of foolin' around
Juggling hearts in a three ring circus
Someday will drive a body down 2 the ground
I never imagined that love would rain on me
And make me want 2 settle down
Baby it's true, I think I do
And I just wanna tell u that I wanna with u (baby, if u do 2)
And baby if u do 2
Forever, forever, baby I want u forever
I wanna keep u 4 the rest of my life (u can make right)
All that is wrong in my world (u are my saviour)
U can make right (u are my light)
U are my saviour, u are my light (forever I want u in my life)
Forever I want u in my life
(la da da da da da da da)
(la da da da da da)
(every man's journey)
There comes a road in every man's journey (don't be afraid)
A road that he's afraid 2 walk on his own (I'm at that road)

I'm here 2 tell u that I'm at that road (I'd rather walk it with)
And I'd rather walk it (u than walk it alone)
With u than walk it alone (u are my future)
U are my hero, u are my future (no past)
When I am with u, I have no past
Oh baby my one and only desire (make this feelin' last)
Is find some way in this doggone world (sugar it's true)
2 make this feelin' last (I know I do)
Oh baby it's true, I know I do (2 with u)
And I just wanna tell u that i
Want 2 with u, yeah
And baby if u do 2
Forever, forever, I want u baby, baby forever (u can make right)
I wanna keep u 4 the rest of my life (u are my saviour)
All that is wrong in my world (u are my light)
U can make right (forever I want u in my life)
U are my saviour, u are my light (la da da da da da da da)
Forever I want u in my life (la da da da da da da da)
La da da da da da da da
La da da da da da
Forever in my life (repeated to fade)
