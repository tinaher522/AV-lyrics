<song artist="Prince" title="It">
I think about IT baby all the time, all right
It feels so good IT must be a crime, all right
I wanna do IT baby every day, all right
In a bed, on the stairs, anywhere, all right
(Come on)
I wanna do IT baby all the time, all right
Cuz when we do IT girl, IT's so divine, all right
I could be guilty 4 my honesty (All right)
But I've got 2 tell U what U mean 2 me, (All right) all right
With U, I swear I'm a maniac, all right
U see, IT ain't no joke, just a natural fact, all right (All right) (Come on)
I wanna do IT baby all the time, all right
Cuz when we do IT girl, IT's so divine, all right
(Doin' IT) IT
(Doin' IT) IT
(Doin' IT) IT
(Doin' IT)
(Come on)
(Come on)
I could be guilty 4 my honesty, all right
But I got 2, I got 2 tell U what U mean 2 me, yeah, all right
Yeah (Come on) Yeah, come on
I wanna do IT baby all the time, all right, yeah
Cuz when we do IT girl, IT's so divine, all right
With U, I swear I'm a maniac, all right, yeah (CHORUS)
U see, IT ain't no joke, just a natural fact, all right

(U see, U make IT so good, IT's so divine, all right)
Cuz when U do IT girl, IT's so divine, all right
I'm gonna think about IT, I'm gonna think about IT, baby
All the time (Think about IT all the time)
Fuckin' on your mind now (Feels so good, must be a crime)
Doin' IT, doin' IT
Doin' IT, doin' IT
