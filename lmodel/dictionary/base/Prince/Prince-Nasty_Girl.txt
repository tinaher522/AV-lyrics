<song artist="Prince" title="Nasty_Girl">
That's right, pleased to meet u
I still (don't wanna/won't) tell u my name
Don't u believe in mystery?
Don't u wanna play my game?
I'm lookin' for a man to love me
Like I never been loved before
I'm lookin' for a man that'll do it anywhere
Even on (the/a) limousinse floor
Cuz
Tonight, I'm living in a fantasy.
My own little nasty world
Tonight, don't u wanna come with me?
Do u think I'm a Nasty Girl?
Tonight, living in a fantasy
My own little nasty world
Tonight, don't u wanna come with me?
Do u think I'm a Nasty Girl?
I guess I'm just used to sailors
I think they got water on the brain
I think they got more water upstairs
Than they got sugar on (the/a) candy cane
That's right, it's been a long time
Since I had a man (who/that) did it real good
If u aint scared, take it out
I'll do it like a real live Nasty Girl should
Tonight, I'm living in a fantasy
My own little nasty world
Tonight, don't u wanna come with me?
Do u think I'm a Nasty Girl?
Tonight, I'm living in a fantasy
My own little nasty world
Tonight, don't u wanna come with me?
Do u think I'm a Nasty Girl?
Tonight, I'm living in a fantasy
My own little nasty world
Tonight, don't u wanna come with me?
Do u think I'm a Nasty Girl?
Tonight, I'm living in a fantasy
My own little nasty world
Tonight, don't u wanna come with me?
Do u think I'm a Nasty Girl?
Please, Please
Please, Please
Nasty Girl (Nasty Girl)
Do u think I'm a Nasty Girl?
Nasty Girl (Nasty Girl)
Do u think I'm a Nasty Girl?
Nasty Girl (Nasty Girl)
Do u think I'm a Nasty Girl?
Nasty Girl (Nasty Girl)
Do u think I'm a Nasty Girl?
(Do u think I'm a Nasty Girl)

Nasty Girl (Nasty Girl)
Do u think I'm a Nasty Girl?

I don't like this groove
Try and give me something I can croon to
Catch my drift?
That'll work
That's right, I can't control it
I need seven inches or more
Tonight I can no longer hold it
Get it up
Get it up
I can't wait anymore
Uh, it's time to jam
Dance nasty girls, dance
(everybody)
Uh, it's time to jam
Nasty girls, dance, dance, dance
(everybody)
Uh, it's time to jam
Nasty girls, dance, dance, dance
Uh, it's time to jam
Nasty girls, dance, dance, dance
Uh, it's time to jam
Nasty girls, dance, dance, dance
Uh, it's time to jam
Nasty girls, dance, dance, dance
Uh, it's time to jam
Come
Nasty girls, dance, dance, dance
Are u going to come?
Uh, it's time to jam
Are u going to come?
Are u going to come?
Nasty girls, dance, dance, dance

Uh

Wake me when your done
I guess u'll be the only one having fun
