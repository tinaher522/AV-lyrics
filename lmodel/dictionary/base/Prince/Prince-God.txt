<song artist="Prince" title="God">
{B-side of Purple Rain}
In the beginning, there was God
He made the earth, and the heavens
He gave us light to rule the day
And another light to rule the night
The Lord, thy God
Made, He made the seas
He made the fruit upon the trees
When He saw, when He saw that it was good
He made a man, made a man
Only He could, only He could
God made u
God made me too
He made us all
Made us all equally
Now u say
God made u
God made me
He made us all equally
Wake up children
Dance the Dance Electric
There isn't much time
Who screamed?
Was it u?
