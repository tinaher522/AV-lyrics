<song artist="Prince" title="My_Tree">
Don't pick my apples
Don't pick my peaches
Leave my tree alone
This is not my money
This is not my car
This is not my world 2
What labels me a star?
CHORUS:
This is my tree, my tree
And I ain't never gonna let U climb me
This is my tree, my tree
And I ain't never gonna let U climb me
Can't a man have secrets?
Can't a man have love?
Can't a man have an attitude?
Or is it all or none?
I don't know what U want
CHORUS
Watch me dance
This is not my woman
This is not her race
Color shouldn't matter
If your soul is in the right place, right place, ooh
CHORUS
Yo, Robin Power's on the mic now
Pumpin' a steady jam, but this ain't a battle
N.P.G. is in the house 2 rattle your brain 2 the new idea
Love's the only drug we're doin' here
Love's the only drug we're doin' here
We doin' it hard! (Hard!)
N.P.G. is in the house and we're just gettin' started (In the house, yeah)
And on the way, I'll preview all the days 2 come (Mm-hmm)
We got a big bad drummer who got computers on the run, oh yes it is
Got computers on the run
N.P.G. in the house (N.P.G. in the house)
N.P.G. in the house (N.P.G. in the house)
Yeah
If U're lookin' 4 (it then)
Look in your own backyard
Plant some peace flowers in your war zone
So I can fire my bodyguards
This is my tree (CHORUS {x5})
No, U ain't climbin' me
I ain't never gonna let cha climb my tree
That's right
Funky, funky, but we got 2 slow this down
Yo, Robin Power's on the mic now
And I'm comin' from a positive place
Uptown James, let's get ready 2 turn this papa out
Yo boy, turn this mic up
I want them 2 hear what I got 2 say
Testing, 1 2, testing, 1 2
It ain't loud enough baby, turn it up
Prince? Prince?
Yo, I don't think U heard me
U got 2 slow this down
Did U hear me? (This is.. this is..)
Yo, yo, slow it down (This is.. this is..)
(This is.. this is my tree)
Yeah
