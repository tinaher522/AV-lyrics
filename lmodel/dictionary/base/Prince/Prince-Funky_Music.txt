Chorus:
(I like funky music)
(I like funky music)
(I like funky music)
(I like funky music)
Everybody get on the floor
We got the groove u feel in your soul
When u're good 'n' funky, u can say u know
Dance 2 the funky music, come on
Chorus
If u ain't got no partner u can use your hair
Shake it like a hooker, baby, I don't care
Whatever u do, u got 2 make the people stare
Dance 2 the funky music, yeah
Chorus
This beat I got is specially designed (specially designed)
2 make u lose your phone number 2 somebody fine
The nastier u get, the funkier we got
My claim 2 fame is scandal, baby, and I ain't here 2 stop (ow!)
(I like funky music)
(I like funky music)
I didn't come 2 trample on what u think is cool
I just wanna hip u 2 a brand new groove
If u like your funky mellow, this ain't 4 u
Dance 2 the funky music, shoo-bed-ooh!
Yeah (chorus)
Uh-huh (uh!)
Uh, uh, uh-huh
Uh, uh-huh

Uh, uh, uh-huh
Yo, the time has come once again 2 send
A dance groove that won't end
Don't pretend that your feet is tired
And grab my hand girlfriend
And move it, baby, move it
I know u can do it
Move it, baby, move it
I know u can do it, come on
I said come on
{repeat chorus in bg till end}
Now let me tell u somethin'
Huh, lookin' so good on the floor
Make me wanna get 2 know u better
And dancin' all up next 2 u
Is a feeling I can feel 4ever
Being 2gether and doing what's clever
And been so hard 2 stop it, uh
I know no one could top it
Huh, yeah
This groove is funky
Huh, yeah
Yo n.p.g. Â¨c drop it!
Huh, say what? 
Huh, huh, say what? 
Say, say what? uh, uh, uh
Say, say, say what? huh, uh, uh, uh
Yo, enough respect goes 2 the artist and the n.p.g. crew
And the whole new york and uptown
And across the country massive
Big up yourselves 'cause it's comin' at cha loud
Alright?
