<song artist="Prince" title="How_Come_U_Don't_Call_Me_Anymore?">
I keep your picture beside my bed 
And I still remember everything U said 
I always thought our love was so right, I guess I was wrong 
I always thought U'd be by my side mama, now U're gone 
What I wanna know, baby 
If what we had was good 
How come U don't call me anymore, yeah? 
Oh anymore 
(Listen...) 
I still light the fire on a rainy night 
I still like it better when U're holding me tight 
(OK, now umm...) 
Everybody said, everybody said that we should never part, ooh yeah 
(I always said that we were kinda cute 2gether myself) 
Tell me baby, baby, baby, why, why'd U wanna go and break my heart? 
(Why'd U wanna do it, baby?) 
All I wanna know, baby 
If what we had was good 
How come U don't call me anymore, yeah? 
Why don't U call me girl? 
Oh yeah, oh yeah 
Sometimes it feels like I'm gonna die 
If U don't call me mama, girl U gotta try 
Down on my knees, beggin' U please, please! ... oh yeah 
Why can't U call me sometime, baby? 
It's just one lousy dime, baby 
Why can't U call me sometime? 
Oh, no no 
Why on Earth can't U just pick up the phone, yeah? 
U know I don't like 2 be alone {fade out} 
Why, why must U torture me baby? 
Why U gotta treat me so bad?
