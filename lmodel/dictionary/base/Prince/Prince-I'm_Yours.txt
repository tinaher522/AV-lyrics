<song artist="Prince" title="I'm_Yours">
I took one look at you
And all the things that we could do
Dance within my head.
Never have I ever made love before
Never have I wanted to till now
Lover, can't you see I want you more and more
Take me baby, yeah... I'm yours
I'll give you what you want
But please love me now
I'll do anything U want
U're the teacher show me how
Never have I ever made love before
Never have I wanted to till now
Lover, can't you see I want you more and more
Take me baby, yeah... I'm yours
