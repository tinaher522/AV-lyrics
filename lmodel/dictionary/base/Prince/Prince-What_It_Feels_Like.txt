<song artist="Prince" title="What_It_Feels_Like">
Been a couple hundred hours
Since he got your call
U use 2 treat me like David
But now I feel like Saul
Been making it rain
All around the world
What difference does it make
When the boy ain't got his girl?
This is what it feels like
This is what it feels like
This is what it feels like, babe
This is what it feels like, babe
This is what it feels like
This is what it feels like
This is what it feels like, babe
Ur name's not David
And it sure ain't Saul
Maybe U have no business
Writing on my wall
Springtime on the Philistines
B4 the middle of the fall (Middle of the fall)
Silly rabbit needs 2 stop doin' tricks
If U wanna get my call
This is what it feels like
This is what it feels like
This is what it feels like, babe
This is what it feels like, baby
This is what it feels like
This is what it feels like, oh
This is what it feels like, babe
This is what it feels like, babe
Everybody goes up and down in a lifetime love affair
Makin' up, just to break it up and pullin' each other's hair
What I wouldn't give 2 have U right here next 2 me
Show U want I really feel about U, we'll kiss and then U'll see
This is what it feels like
This is what it feels like
This is what it feels like, babe
This is what it feels like, babe
The art of seduction
U and me is the right equation
And all U need 2 reach my lovin'
Is why I stared down a muffin
I can't wait 2 be Ur baby
Baby, here I am, just take me
This is what it feels like
This is what it feels like, baby
This is what it feels like
This is what it feels like
This is what it feels like
This is what it feels like, babe
This is what it feels like
This is what it feels like, babe
This is what it feels like
This is what it feels like, babe
This is what it feels like
This is what it feels like, babe
This is what it feels like, babe
