<song artist="Prince" title="Somewhere_Here_On_Earth">
i know u're out there 
i can feel ur eyes on me 
the same influence and touch {seen that face a thousand times}
cuz love is just 2 much {if only in my dreams}
i know u're ready for me {i know u really want me}
i can feel ur hands on me 
i really want u 2 {i really wanna touch u 2}
but we're just 2 shy 2 speak {in a way i'm much 2 shy 2 speak}
here on earth {and even though}
all on earth {we're all alone}
i feel {4 what it's worth}
as long as u're here on earth {ur somewhere here on earth}
i know, i know u're out there {delete the first 'i know'}
i feel u getting closer 2 me {i can feel u getting closer 2 me}
i'm just wondering what u're waiting 4 
when u know i am free {delete 'when'}
instead of ur rage, {in this digital age} u could just page me 
but that was a bridge, {i know it's the rage}
i just don't think i'd gauge {but it just don't engage me}
i like the face to face {delete 'i'}
do you want 2 do this at urs, or my place? 

it's been so long 
since i been with somebody 
i admit {like a million years}
but now i'm here on earth {now ur here on earth}
[Renato piano] 
{somewhere here on earth}
{i like u; i love u}
{listen}
i know u hear me 
like a whisper in ur ear 
u don't have to feel me {u don't have 2 fear me}
u r the thing i hold so dear {ur everything i hold so dear}
i know u already love me 
and now u're just 2 cute 2 say {ur probably just 2 cool 2 say}
somebody somewhere put u down 
but that's ok, that's ok 
when u feel {cuz when u feel}
it's time 2 heal 
nobody says {? no more}
we're both here on earth {as long as i'm here on earth}
