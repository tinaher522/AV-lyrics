The undertaker
Put away the guns 4 future's sake
Don't U be another number 4 the undertaker
Put away the guns 4 future's sake
Don't U be another number 4 the undertaker

Calling mercy
Turn off the violence, there's children watching
Listen 2 the silence, it's a better box 2 be in
Turn off the violence, there's children watching
Listen 2 the silence, it's a better box 2 be in

In the evening

Dance with the undertaker (Dance with the undertaker)
Don't do it (Don't do it)
