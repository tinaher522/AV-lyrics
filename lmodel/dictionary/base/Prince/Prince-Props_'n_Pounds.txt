"Here is someone that's obviously playing rock and roll who is also a 
funk artist, who covered a lot of categories that which artists have 
been separating for so long and brought them together purposely ... ." 
Props  n pounds
Props  n pounds 
Love 4 one another is the only sound 2day 
Positivity is the only way 
Chorus: 
Props  n pounds
Props  n pounds 
Love 4 one another is the only sound 2day 
Negative people don't get to play 
Props  n pounds
Props  n pounds 
Why you wanna holler when you know what the bible say 
Positivity is the only way 
Once again when the coin is tossed 
And lands upon the sea 
Unsuspecting lives are lost
They didn't have to be 
When the book is opened 
and The Son condemns them all 
Pagan holidays,crucifixes
$100  tears  will fall 
Chorus :
(hey)
(no play) 
(you know it) 
All the ones still in the game
Never give me pounds 
Egotists  to proud to say the opposite of found 
Worrying about the validity of the rulers crown 
When everyone ought 2 be in line giving props n pounds 
Chorus:
(hey hey hey)
(ooow) 
Props n pounds
Props n pounds
Props n pounds 
Once again when the money get tossed 
Never gonna see npg floss
Keeping you happy is the only cost 
Love God and everyone or your life will be lost 
Listen to the words that will save every one 
Safe sex campaign talking about a gun 
With  CON as the prefix, suffix be the DOM 
(dumb) 
Look at them both and tell me something 
What's in the Trojan Horse? Lubrication. 
Nothing goes in my woman except The Son 
REWIND

" ... I mean he's just one of the greatest live performers there is but 
all this other stuff, the attitude, going on around it. I mean you can 
be a great musician and not have the right kind of approach. And Prince 
has the right approach 2. ...I think the gift of simplicity is like a 
keynote of art I mean, he doesn't  he knows when to stop - usually ...."
