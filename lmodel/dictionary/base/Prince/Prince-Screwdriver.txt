<song artist="Prince" title="Screwdriver">
Everyday when I wake up
Gotta make up
Another reason to make it last, miss mistake up
If we break up
We smash guitars and shatter glass
But till the day that we do
I'm your driver, and you're my screw
Everywhere that we go now, there's a show now
People pay money for the rock 'n' roll
And the big wow
Before we bow
You can call me C.C. - Crowd Control
If you don't want to, it's cool
I'm your driver
Empty car on a fast train
In the driving rain
I can make you swear that you did somethang
What you don't know
Won't hurt you so
We got a long, long way to go
Might as well enjoy the view
I'm your driver, and you're my screw
You said you were my screw
Sharing stories and cool clothes
And party toes
This is what life is like on the road
Never too high, never too low
That's the only way to go
But right now, without further ado
I'm your driver, and you're my screw
Counter-clockwise, turn you round
All you got to do is listen to the sound
Music never lies, you know its true
I ain't even got to you know who
Time we got plenty of
Forever's worth the wait when it comes to love
I'm your driver, and you're my screw
I'm your driver, and you're my screw
I'm your driver, and you're my screw
I'm your driver, and you're my screw
I'm your driver, and you're my screw
Might as well enjoy the view
I'm your driver, and you're my screw
