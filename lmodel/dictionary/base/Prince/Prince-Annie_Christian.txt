<song artist="Prince" title="Annie_Christian">
Annie Christian wanted to be number 1
but her kingdom never comes, thy will be done
She couldn't stand the glory, she would be 2nd to none
the way Annie tells the story, she's his only son
Annie Christian wanted to be a big star
so she moved to Atlanta and she bought a blue car
she killed black children, and what's fair is fair
if u try and say u're crazy, everybody say electric chair
electric chair
Annie Christian, Annie Christ
until u're crucified, I'll live my life in taxicabs
Annie Christian, Annie Christ
until u're crucified, I'll live my life in taxicabs
Annie Christian was a whore always looking for some fun
being good was such a bore, so she bought a gun
she killed John Lennon, shot him down cold
she tried to kill Reagan, everybody say gun control
gun control
Annie Christian, Annie Christ
until u're crucified I'll live my life in taxicabs
Annie Christian, Annie Christ
until u're crucified I'll live my life in taxicabs
Liar Liar Liar! got ya in a jam
put your head on the block, somebody say ABSCAM
ABSCAM
Annie Christian, Annie Christ
until u're crucified I'll live my life in taxicabs
Annie Christian, Annie Christ
until u're crucified I'll live my life in taxicabs
