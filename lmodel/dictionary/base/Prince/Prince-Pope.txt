<song artist="Prince" title="Pope">
(U don't understand)
(I ain't scared of U muthafuckas - kick it!)
(Stir it like coffee)
The Pope
(Stir it like (mo'fuckin') coffee)
The Pope, uh
(What the hell?)
This is the Pope
Oh, your car got mags that be dippy dippy dope
But the whole damn nation got the same
Honey only flock 2 the bee - that's the Pope
Not the President with government lame
Put me on a slow movin' parliamentary hackin' bandwagon
U could put me little ass in the grave
Every time U want it, I'll be live - bring a date
I mean computer - when it's over, press save
So U can be the President (Kick it)
I'd rather be the Pope (I'd rather be, so help me)
Yeah, U can be the side effect (Baby)
I'd rather be the dope
(I ain't scared of U muthafuckas - kick it!)
Call your girl named Sally and U figure U were chill (Chill)
Then U find out I'm the reason Sally's on the pill (Pill)
What am I supposed 2 do when the President can't get nothin' passed?
Find an alley, find an alley - undress Sally right in front of your ass!
(Well, she helped me once again)
I say U can be the President (Kick it)
I'd rather be the Pope (I'd rather be, so help me)
Yeah, U can be the side effect (Baby)
I'd rather be the dope (Fuck that)
The Pope
(Oh no motherfucker, not 2day)
U can be the President√© (Rather be the Pope)
So help me
Who's the funky drummer with the crooked little sticks? (Sticks)
He might have better luck if he was drummin' with his dick (Dick?)
If U don't play the piccolo, why U wanna lick?
Now check the drum solo and tell me not 2 kick it
(Seek and destroy)
(It'll fuck U up)
I love the taste of unpredictable licks
A loop is a loop is a loop, uh!
A loop is a loop is a loop, uh! (Fuck that)
A loop is a loop is a loop is a loop is a loop is a loop is a loop
Your car got mags that be dippy dippy dope
But the whole damn nation got the same
Honey only flock 2 the bee - that's the Pope
Not the President with government lame
Put me on a slow movin' parliamentary hackin' bandwagon
U will put me little ass in the grave
Every time U want it, I'll be live - bring a date
I mean computer - when it's over, press save
So U can be the President (Kick it)
I'd rather be the Pope (I rather be, so help me)
U can be the side effect (Baby)
I'd rather be the dope (U, U, U)
The Pope
U can be the President (Fuck that)
Rather be the Pope
Baby, so help me please
I love U
Press save
I love U
Peace
(U don't understand)
