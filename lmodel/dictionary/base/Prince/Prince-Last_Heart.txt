<song artist="Prince" title="Last_Heart">
Oh, baby {x2}
How many times have U called my number
Wishing I was someone else?
How many times did my heart tumble
Feeling sorry 4 myself?
How many times have I kissed U
And smelled another man's perfume?
How many lonely nights I missed U
Wishing 4 your body in my lonely room? (Lonely room)
Baby, if U break my heart one more time
It'll be the last heart U ever break
I've taken all I can take
Baby, this heart wasn't made 2 break
How many times can U hurt me (Hurt me)
Before your conscience make U stop? (Stop, stop, oh)
U made it all, why not desert me?
Baby, U know U can never cop, never cop (Never cop)
A body that'll do U like I do
U got 2 get your thing 2gether, sister
I'm tired of being your fool
If U break my heart one more time
It'll be the last heart U ever break
Baby, I've taken all I can take
Baby, my heart wasn't made 2 break
Oh Lord
Baby, don't U break my heart, no no
Don't do it!
If U break my heart one more time
It'll be the last heart U ever break
Darlin', I've taken all I can take
Baby, this heart wasn't made 2 break
(When U fix your mouth 2 tell that lie)
When U fix your mouth 2 tell a brand new lie
(Never before told, by and by)
Remember this story told, by and by
(False words should never be spoken)
False words should never be, never be spoken
(My heart should never be broken)
And baby, my heart should never be, never be broken
If U break my heart one more time
It'll be the last heart U ever break
Liner notes: This was intended as a demo, which is usually
unheard of in Prince's mind. He had always intended on
re-recording this track, but never got around 2 it.
