<song artist="Prince" title="9_Lives">
9 - 9 - 9 - 9 - 9 lives
This is the 90's and I need a lover with (9 lives)
With my bad self
(If I really) {sample repeats in song}
I.. I.. I.. I...
(9 lives)
Sing Stella
CHORUS:
If I really had 9 lives
I'd want a lover that controlled my mind
Someone who knows about the heavenly sin
How 2 kill with love again, again and again
When she calls me on the phone
She'll ask if I'm alone
Standin' at my door lookin' mega-fine
Heck-a-pump body sayin' good time
When all the others talk plenty of jive
My lover talks about 9 lives
The first 2 promise I'll die from the heat
Generated from the moment that our eyes meet
CHORUS
(With my bad self)
Life number 3 and number 4
Are spent makin' love on the magic floor
It's got no walls so all can see
The way real love is supposed 2 be
Don't be ashamed, my lover said
Then she says "Mmm, I betcha I'm mega-jammin'"
Life number 5, 6 and 7
Need U ask, go like heaven
CHORUS
(With my bad self)
(Control me)
With my bad self
If I really had 9 lives
I'd want a lover that controlled my mind
2 kill with love, we'd never die
We'd never long 4, we'd never cry
If we live 4 havin' each other's touch
It's never 2 little, it's never 2 much
Play
With my bad self
With my, with my bad self
If I really had, if I really had, if I really had 9 lives
This is the 90's
And everybody wants a lover
A life-long lover with 9 lives
(9 lives)
This is the 90's
(CHORUS) {repeat in BG}
Sing Stella
Call me up on the phone
I'll be here all alone
I'll be waitin' on U, baby
I'll be waitin' on U and your 9 lives!
Silence
