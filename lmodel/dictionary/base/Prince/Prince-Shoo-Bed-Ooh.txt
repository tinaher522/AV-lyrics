<song artist="Prince" title="Shoo-Bed-Ooh">
So u thought u just might lose your mind 2day
Brother pushin' that game on ya as if u wanna play
Askin' u every other sentence if them titties are real
One tramp even had the nerve 2 touch 'em as if u wanted a feel
Chorus:
Shoo-bed-ooh, shoo-bed-ooh, ooh!
Shoo-bed-ooh, shoo-bed-ooh, ooh!
The money that u make ain't payin' the rent, so u sleep in cars
U wonder aloud if u're happy - u say, yea, as if u really are
This car u drive with no gas won't take u very far
U look up in the sky and wish upon a star (upon a star)
Chorus
The answer 2 the question of life is a gray-haired bitch at least
Suckin' on the ebony dancer in between these dirty sheets
Spittin' out the aftertaste of a boy who might not call again
If this is the game u stood in line 4 ¨c how're u gonna win? 
(how're u gonna win? )
Shoo-bed-ooh, shoo-bed-ooh, ooh!
So u thought he just might come every time u phone
As if u've never been lonely as if u've never been alone
(as if u've never been alone)
How u ever gonna win if u let 'em all see your hand? 
Playin' the queen don't work on your knees as if u understand
Chorus {x2}
The answer 2 the question of life is a gray-haired bitch at least
Suckin' on the ebony dancer in between these dirty sheets
Spittin' out the aftertaste of a boy who might not call again
If this is the game u stood in line 4 ¨c how're u gonna win? 
How u gonna win? 
Chorus {x2}
So u thought u just might lose your mind 2day
