I...I...I...I...
Erotic City
Erotic City
All of my purple life
I've been looking for a dame
That would wanna be my wife
That was my intention, babe
If we cannot make babies,
maybe we can make some time
Thoughts of pretty u and me,
Erotic City come alive
We can funk until the dawn,
making love 'til cherry's gone
Erotic City can't u see,
thoughts of pretty u and me
Everytime I comb my hair
Thoughts of u get in my eyes
U're a sinner, I don't care
I just want your creamy thighs
If we cannot make babies,
maybe we can make some time
Thoughts of pretty u and me,
Erotic City come alive
We can funk until the dawn,
making love 'til cherry's gone
Erotic City can't u see,
thoughts of pretty u and me
All of my hang-ups r gone
How I wish u felt the same
We can funk until the dawn
('Til the dawn) (Until the dawn)
How I wish u were my dame
(Baby won't u call my name)

If we cannot make babies,
maybe we can make some time
Thoughts of pretty u and me,
Erotic City come alive
We can funk until the dawn,
making love 'til cherry's gone
Erotic City can't u see,
thoughts of pretty u and me
Baby, u're so creamy
If we cannot make babies,
maybe we can make some time
Thoughts of pretty u and me,
Erotic City come alive
We can funk until the dawn,
making love 'til cherry's gone ('Til the dawn)
Erotic City can't u see,
thoughts of pretty u and me
If we cannot make babies,
maybe we can make some time (U and me)
Some time, some time, some time, Erotic City
If we cannot make babies,
maybe we can make some time
Thoughts of pretty u and me,
Erotic City come alive
We can funk until the dawn,
making love 'til cherry's gone (Come alive)
Erotic City can't u see,
thoughts of pretty u and me
We can funk until the dawn,
making love 'til cherry's gone
Erotic City
Erotic City
