<song artist="Prince" title="On_The_Couch">
Come on, baby
Don't make me sleep on the couch
Love Jones is on the TV again, baby
Eye wanna go down south, yeah
Oh come on, baby
It's undignified, undignified 2 sleep alone, oh yes it is
That's what all the people that ain't got nobody do
Know they do, talkin' on the telephone
Don't make me crash
Don't you do it baby
Don't make me sleep 
Without ur kiss
Tossin' and a turnin'
With every inch of me yearnin'
Don't you make me, don't you make me 
Don't you make me, don't you make me 
Don't you make me, don't you make me 
Don't you make me, don't you make me 
Don't you make me suffer this
Eye know we agreed
Eye know we agreed 2 b married
Shouldn'ta let me unzip your dress
Why'd you do it? Why'd you do it?
Confess u tease
Confess u please
Don't make me sleep out on the couch
