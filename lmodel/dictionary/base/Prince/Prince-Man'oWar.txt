<song artist="Prince" title="Man'oWar">
Why U screamin'?
U know I'm not a man of war
Break a gold chain that I gave U
Throw it down on the floor
Instead of this 7 page letter
I wish I had peace of mind
My friends tell me, "U should go get her"
But lovin' U, lovin' U, lovin' U is a waste of time
Oh, yes it is, it's a waste of time, ooh
I need 2 get out of this city
I need 2 get U outta my head
I need 2 get away from the words that U said 2 me
(Why U screamin'?) Oh, baby 
(U know I'm not a man of war)
How could U have think that I could put something inside of someone
That I put inside U, inside U?
Even if I tried 2, if I tried 2 (Tried 2, tried 2)
I couldn't 'cause I still smell like that last time when we 
I.. but lovin' U, lovin' U, lovin' U's a waste of time (Is a waste of time)
Oh, yes it is
But lovin' U is a waste of time, baby
Ooh
I need 2 feel wanted again
I need 2 feel love is alive, yeah 
I need 2 hear U say that U ain't lookin' 4 another reason 2 make me cry
Why U screamin'? (Ooh uh)
U know I'm not a man of war
I've been tryin' 2 make U happy, baby, ever since we were sophomores
But lovin' U, lovin' U, lovin' U's a waste of time
Oh, yes it is (Is a waste of time)
Ooh, it's a waste of time, waste of time, waste of time

If there is no future
Then there is no past
And all we've got is right now
Let us make it last, make it last, make it last, ooh
Why U screamin'?
U know I'm not a man of war
Break the gold chain that I gave U 
Throw it down on the floor (Oh, throw it down)
Instead of this 7 page letter
I wish I had peace of mind
My friends tell me, they tell me, "U should go get her"
But lovin' U, lovin' U, lovin' U's a waste of time
Oh, a waste of time, yeah
I need 2 get out of this city
I need 2 get U outta my head
I need 2, I need 2 get away from the words that U said 2 me
I need 2, hey, I need 2 feel wanted again, oh
I need 2, huh, feel no sin
Hear me
(But lovin' U, lovin' U, lovin' U...) 
Why U screamin'?
U know I'm not a man of war
Break the gold chain that I gave U 
Throw it down on the floor (Oh baby)
Instead of this 7 page letter
I wish I had peace of mind
But my friends tell me, "U should go get her" 
But lovin' U, lovin' U, lovin' U is a waste of time
U know I'm not a man'o'war
