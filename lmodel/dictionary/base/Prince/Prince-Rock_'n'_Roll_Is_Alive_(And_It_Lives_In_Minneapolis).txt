(Rock 'n' roll is alive!) 
Rock 'n' roll is alive (Rock 'n' roll is alive!) 
(Rock 'n' roll is alive and it lives in Minneapolis!) {x2} 
From all over the world the people came 
Even the President flies in 2 worship a thing called fame 
Red, white, and blue boy / girls - 2night everyone's the same 
Some people say it's dyin', but we don't wanna play that game 
Rock 'n' roll is alive and it lives in Minneapolis! (Sing!) 
Rock 'n' roll is alive (and it lives in Minneapolis!) 
Rock 'n' roll is alive and it lives in Minneapolis! (Sing!) 
Rock 'n' roll is alive (and it lives in Minneapolis!) 
Sure as the drive around Lake of the Isles is cool I know (Oh) 
Rock 'n' roll will never die like the Minnehaha flow (Oh) 
Sure as the land of a thousand lakes is sometimes made of snow 

There'll always be another king 2 die butt-naked on the floor (Oh) 
Rock 'n' roll is alive and it lives in Minneapolis! (Sing!) 
Rock 'n' roll is alive (and it lives in Minneapolis!) (Oh) 
Rock! Rock! 
(Very impressive) 
Rock! Rock! 
(Sing!) 
(Rock 'n' roll is alive and it lives in Minneapolis!) (Sing damn it!) 
Rock! Rock! 
Rock 'n' roll is alive! (Yeah!) 
(Rock 'n' roll is alive and it lives in Minneapolis!) {x4} 
(Rock 'n' roll is alive and it lives in Minneapolis!) {x4}
