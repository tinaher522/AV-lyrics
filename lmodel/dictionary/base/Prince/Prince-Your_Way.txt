<song artist="Prince" title="Your_Way">
Every time I try to take a breath so deep
I only fall back to my life
Feeling like the black sheep
But this time I wanna dive
Rising every morning, sinking every night
Notice, there is more to love
So I've to walk into the light
To recognize the Lord above
Coordination every move, you see
I don't need a lot of fame
Because he knows me
Because he knows my name
So showing my real face
Makes me dive into the ocean
Of life with a whole new space
A whole new me with every step and every motion
So scream it or roar
Because you are gay
So why shut the door
He knows, he made you this way
