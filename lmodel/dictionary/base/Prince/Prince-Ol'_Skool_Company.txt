<song artist="Prince" title="Ol'_Skool_Company">
Every once in awhile
You need some ol' skool company
Somebody that appreciates a sexy groove
And a old school melody
When God, his son and the love of family
Ruled in the community
The songs you sing
Lift you up to heaven
A heaven we can believe in
Everybody's talkin' about hard times
Like it just started yesterday
People eye know they've been strugglin'
At least it seems that way
Fat cats on Wall Street
They got a bailout
While somebody else got to wait
Seven hundred billion but my old neighborhood
Ain't nothing changed but the date
Every once in awhile
You need some ol' skool company
Somebody that appreciates a sexy groove
And a old school melody
When God, his son and the love of family
Ruled in the community
The songs you sing
Lift you up to heaven
A heaven we can believe in
Ain't nothing ever come from complaining
Except a bitter heart, that's true
Follow along and you gon wanna do
Something before the next chorus is through
The songs we sing
They used to mean somethin'
Now every other one is just mean
Rather than reminisce I'm telling you this
It's time for a brand new scene
Every once in awhile
You need some ol' skool company
Somebody that appreciates a sexy groove
And a old school melody
When God, his son and the love of family
Ruled in the community
The songs you sing
Lift you up to heaven
A heaven we can believe in
Everybody's sinkin' in the quicksand
Created by the keeper of time
Cast aside by using ancient tricks
That changes your state of mind
They got you catering the whims of the flesh
Before you get your paper right
Call me old fashioned
But back in the day
There wasn't no shorties in sight
First come job then come marriage 
Before shorty come out with the baby carriage 
Call me old fashioned 
Just clap yo hands just clap yo hands
Radio used to be local untouched by the man
Songs we used to sing used to mean something
Now they just bland like the drummer
Where's the real drummer? Michael B.
Mint Condition, Morris Day
Jellybean wishin' Sheila E and Brother John, sometimes me
'til dawn
If the White House is black
We gotta take the radio back
Power to the people
Power to the people
Put this thing on repeat go back to one
And just move your feet tell your friends 
Prince and the Mplsound we can't be beat
Suckas
