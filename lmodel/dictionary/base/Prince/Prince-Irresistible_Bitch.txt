<song artist="Prince" title="Irresistible_Bitch">
{B-side of Let's Pretend We're Married}
Let him sing
Turn it down a little
Every friday night I call your butt up on the phone
A deeper voice answers and says you're not at home
Now if u think that I'm a fool who'll go 4 any line
Then honey, put down all your money, u win every time
Irresistible bitch
I love the way u walk
Irresistible bitch
I love the way u talk
Irresistible bitch
And I really dig the way u kiss
Irresistible
Oh mama, I wish I could resist
All my partners ask me why I take so much abuse
Why am I so faithful, honey? Why are u so loose?
They say why am I the one who never gets to take u home?
But they don't know the things u do 2 me when we're alone
Irresistible bitch
I love the way u walk
Irresistible bitch
I love the way u talk
Irresistible bitch
I really dig the way u kiss
Irresistible
Oh mama, I wish I could resist
Hurt me, hurt me
Stole all my honey
Played it off like it was a joke
You're stealing all my honey, baby, keep u by my side
Bleed me till I'm broke.
Sugar
Hell if I know why I let u drive my car
Don't I know that walking won't get me very far?
Sure I know that crying over u is just in vain
But all things I lose don't add up to all the things I gain
Irresistible bitch
I love the way u walk
Irresistible bitch
I love the way u talk
Irresistible bitch
And I really dig the way u kiss
Ain't it a shame? (Irresistible) 
Oh mama, mama, I wish I could re-
Hurt me!
Stole all my honey
Played it off like it was a joke
Stealing all my honey, baby, keep u by my side
Bleed me till I'm broke
Everybody, everybody dance
Everybody, everybody
Everybody, everybody dance
Everybody
Irresistible bitch
Irresistible bitch
Everybody, everybody dance
Everybody
Irresistible bitch
Everybody, everybody dance
Everybody
Irresistible bitch
