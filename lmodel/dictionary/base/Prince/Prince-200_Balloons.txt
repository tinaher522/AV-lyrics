Who gonna stop 200 balloons?
Nobody
Let's do it
25 policemen all in a row
Can't stop the party people - Go go go
If U can't beat 'em join 'em baby say so
It's party time everybody come on lets go
Fly with me
200 balloons (Let's do it)
Blowing down the city colder than ice
I think U better love me 'cuz I'm really kind of nice
If U do me once girl U have 2 do me twice
Wave your hand if U wanna party tonight
Come on everybody
200 balloons
Everybody sing it
Fly with me (Let's do it)
Come on baby fly with me (Let's do it)
Fly with me (Let's do it)
Come on baby fly with me
I'll buy U love if I got
200 balloons (Let's do it)
Tell me that U love me and I'll buy U a fancy car
I made U a couple of times and so U made me a star
So take me 4 what I'm worth, love me 4 what I are
(Do, do) The Partyman, I take U way far

Cry Cry Cry
I love it when U moan
This funk will cut so deep
Gonna touch your soul, oh (200 balloons)
(Do it, Do it, Do it, Do it)
My funk is multilayered (I just)
Don't stop me now (I just)
I got a fever pumpin'
Don't stop me now
I'll make love to U (I just)
(Ain't day...sea to sea) (I just)
I got a warehouse full of protection, 2 times
Good lord (200 balloons) I wanna be your (Rave) busy bee
I'll be your busy bee
Come on queen...
(Rave, 200, 200, Rave, 200 balloons) (Let's do, let's, let's do it)
(Rave, Fly with me)
(Fly with me {200} {Rave} {200} Fly with me}) (200 {Let's do it} balloons)
Rave, unto the joy fantastic, Rave
(Let's do it)
