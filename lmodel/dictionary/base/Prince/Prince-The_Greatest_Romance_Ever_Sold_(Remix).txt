<song artist="Prince" title="The_Greatest_Romance_Ever_Sold_(Remix)">
EVE: Ur eyez seem 2 whisper in2 xtasy
4 a long time I never let a soul next 2 me
Melted all over ur frame and tested me Handled it
Honestly? My brain - U scrambled it
Said U'd like 2 b my Adam - I needed that
And U like 4ever I stayed, but U pleaded dead
Made U mine How could U ever leave I
E.V.E. created new feelings The first believe I
Embrace ur whole being Soul I took over
I became ur queen U 2 me my knight, my love soldier
Enjoy my fruit juices abundant, have plenty
Never had 2 think twice: I'm urs alone 4 life simply
Conquer all, breath 4 each other
U'll never find love as warm
or as deep or as enticing as mine
Control U, know U'll die without me Nuff said
Nothing's as tempting as Eve Never doubt me
ADAM: Make it alone without U - clever
U got the tight puller, I got the lever
Sweet drops of rain I am 2 ur umbrella
2gether we make the remix a big seller
So what do U know, U and me finally face 2 face
Checkin' each other up and down in all of the obvious places
Was there ever a reason 4 us 2 b apart?
The air that fills up this room says, "not hardly"
So this is where U end and U and I begin...
The greatest romance that's ever been sold
Now your mind is open 2 poetry that's seldom heard
Ur has never been broken until U've heard these words:
"Ur body was designed 2 respond 2 mine
in spite of Ur desire 2 mold me"
And in the middle of it all - we kiss and like rain we fall in2...
The greatest romance that's ever been sold
I know U feel me, I know that U can dance,
but what do U know about the greatest romance?
Not what U think, but what U believe
What was the real reason that Adam never left Eve?
And if the truth sounds like a memory then U know it was meant 2 b
Leave Ur inhibitions behind Come on, come on, and c
So this is where U end and U and I begin...
The greatest romance that's ever been sold
I know U feel me, I know can dance,
but what do U know about the greatest romance?
Not what U think, but what U believe
