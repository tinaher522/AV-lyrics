<song artist="Prince" title="Objects_In_The_Mirror">
That's my favorite time with u
just after we make a movie,
the kind that requires the title
"Parental Advisory"
Let's brush r teeth in the same sink,
don't worry girl it's cool
We can pose in the mirror,
eye'm diggin u diggin' on me
yea, me diggin' on u
We're hooked up now, eye can try her
eye can put my load in the dryer
So much we can share
the same height, weight, and body fluid
We're hooked up now, we can do it
Been waitin' baby...
it's so hard 2 bear
the objects in the mirror r closer
than they appear...
