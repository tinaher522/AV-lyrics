Oh baby
(Right back here in my arms) {x2}
Right back here, yeah
Don't want u 2 write me no letters
Don't want u calling my farm
I just want u, I just want u
I just want u right back here in my arms
Alright
I ain't checkin 4 the sweet talk baby (Right)
Talkin' 'bout how u're missin' my charms (Right)
I just want u, I just want u
I just want u right back here in my arms (Cuz that's my only mission)
I just want u, I just want u
I just want u right back here in my arms
(Right back here in my arms)
Oh baby
(Right back here in my arms)
Oh baby
I know u got a lot on ur mind (Right)
That's why I wanna give u some time (Right)
Til I get 2, til I get 2
Til I get 2 hug that body so fine
I know u need a little space, just a little
That's why I ain't showin' my face (Right)
I just want u, I just want u
I just want u right back here in my arms
Oh baby 
(Right back here in my arms) 
(Right, right) 
Right back in my arms (Right back here in my arms) 
Right back, right back 
Right back here in my arms 
(Right) (Right back here in my arms) 
No, no, no 2 the postman bringin' me letters
U know a brotha gonna feel much better
If he keeps his mind on, U know, whatever
Cuz I can't stop thinkin' about what we do
There ought 2 be a low against the hoochie ooh!  (ooh!)
Can we groove?  I don't wanna do u know harm
I just want u right back here in my arms
Oh baby (Right back here in my arms)
Don't want u 2 write me no letters
I just want u, I just want u
I just want u right back here in my arms
Ooh yeah, right back here in my arms 
(Right back here in my arms) 
I just want U right back here in my arms (Right) 
Right back here in my arms 
(Right back here in my arms) (Right) 
Right back, right back (Right) 
I'll try 2 write U back 
(Right back here in my arms)
