(in sports, the international basketball league was busy last night)
(with 7 games on the schedule)
{phone rings}
(the cavaliers came up with a surprise upset)
(beating the bullets 108 to 99)
Talk
X-tv, turn it on
Michael, what's happenin'? 
(the lakers had no trouble with the rockets winning 124 to 88)
U gotta watch this show that's on
Watch what? 
I don't know what it is, it's crazy
(the nuggets just got by the nets 114 to 112)
What channel is it on? 
X-tv, turn it on
Alright, later
Later
(the super sonics devastated the jazz 136...)
So I'm walkin' down the street and umm..
This muthaf**ka comes up 2 me and says
(yo man, u oughta let me have 50 dollars man)
(can u give? )
I said "ain't that a bitch? u oughta get out of my face"
(oh)
And he tried 2 rob me
(muthaf**ker, mm)
And he was chokin' me, right? 
'cause, 'cause he didn't have no gun
Do u hear that shit? 
Lucky 4 me, my homies was comin' 'round the 7-eleven
And they seen what was goin' down
They grabbed this muthaf**ker, right? 
("what's up man? ")
Ripped an eyeball out
(ahhh! "f**k him up")
They beat his ass so bad, change fell out his pocket
(u bastards, mm)
These nigga's are crazies
So I said "f**k it"
I robbed him, ha ha
With so much money on me, I figured I oughta hit jannell's house
I knocked on her door, right? 
(mmm, oh)
I don't know what she was doin'
(oh, ooh)
But I couldn't get no answer? 
She was doin' some wrong shit
"jannell" I shouted, still no answer
(mmm, oh, oh)

I figured she was on the telephone or somethin'
(oh)
So I walked around 2 the bathroom window
Pushed it up, climbed inside
Soon as I got inside, it hit me {gasp}
Damn!
I don't know what it was but it hit me hard
"uh"
Jannell's a rican, u know? 
And them beans and rice is a habit at jannell's house, u know? 
I grab my mouth, my nose and I just screamed
And then I ran
But jannell's house is real messy and I hit somethin' and I fell
That somethin' was jannell
(get off!)
I stepped on her bruised booty she got from stage diving
And it made her real mad so we went 2 rounds
Jannell can bob
She kicked my ass
Damn!
"oh god"
So I left and I went 2 glam slam
And slammed a few long island's
Uh-oh, one 2 many
Excuse me brother, better hit this alley
Phew! that was close
(yo muthaf**ker, ain't u the one stole my money? )
Oh shit
(yeah, that's u)
I gotta run y'all
(that's u nigga, come here)
(kick your muthaf**kin' ass)
Ahh, ahh
Now what is this crazy muthaf**kin' shit? 
Ahh, ahh
Man, did u see it? 
Did u hear it man? 
Yeah man
It was so crazy, that shit man
Ha, yeah I know, I couldn't believe it
Ah man, but I tell u what man
I'm kinda wiped out man
So I'm goin' 2 get some rest man
