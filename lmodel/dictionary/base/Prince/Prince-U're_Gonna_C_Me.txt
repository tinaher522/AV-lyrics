<song artist="Prince" title="U're_Gonna_C_Me">
I know that I'm not gonna sleep tonight
Cause you're not by my side and that ain't right
I thought that we bought this bed for two,
But what good is it if I'm not with you
Gimme a page on my to-way
I'll hit you back with no delay
When you hear all I've got to say
You're gonna see me
Whether in person or the phone
I've got to get you all alone
And when I do baby it's on
You're gonna see me, you're gonna see me
There's never a minute that I find
That you don't ever cross my mind
If you could just hold me tight you'd see, 
There's nothing harder for you than me
Gimme a page on my to-way
I'll hit you back with no delay
When you hear all I've got to say
You're gonna see me
Whether in person or the phone
I've got to get you all alone
And when I do baby it's on
You're gonna see me, you're gonna see me
Gimme a page on my to-way
I'll hit you back with no delay
You're the reason I took a rope and lassoed the moon
To prove that when it comes to you
There's nothing I won't do
I'd stare into the sun if you would be mine
It's not so great a leap since to all others I'm blind
I know that I'm not gon' sleep tonight
