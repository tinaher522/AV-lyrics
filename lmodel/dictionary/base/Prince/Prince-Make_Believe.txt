<song artist="Prince" title="Make_Believe">
Make believe U're a hero, make believe U're a star
Make believe that U're somebody instead of who U really are
Make believe
It's only a movie
U don't need 2 scratch 4 crumbs when U deserve the whole cake
Make believe U're Sidney Poitier, believe, U gotta make believe
U got 2 make believe, U got 2 make believe
Baby, U got 2 make believe it's only a movie
Make believe U're sophisticated, make believe that U're en vogue
Make believe that U're quite wealthy even though
U're so broke U can't pay attention
Baby, U got 2 make believe, U got 2 make believe
Make believe it's only a movie
Make believe U're a star
U got 2 make believe, U got 2 make believe
U got 2 make believe, U got 2 make believe
