<song artist="Prince" title="Avalanche">
He was not or never had been in favor
of setting r people free
if it wasn't 4 the 13th Amendment
we woulda been born in slavery
He was not or never had been in favor
of letting us vote so u c...
Abraham Lincoln was a racist who said
"U cannot escape from history"
Like the snow comin' down the mountain
that landed on Wounded Knee
Nobody wants 2 take the weight-
The responsibility
Hear the joyous sound of freedom
The Harlem Renaissance
Hear Duke Ellington and his band
kick another jungle jam
Ooh, do u wanna dance?
Who's that lurking in the shadows?
Mr. John Hammond with his pen in hand...
sayin' "Sign ur kingdom over 2 me
and b known throughout the land!"
But, u ain't got no money, U ain't got no cash,
So u sign yo name and he claims innocence
just like every snowflake in an avalanche...
Like the snow comin' down the mountain
that landed on Wounded Knee
Nobody wants 2 take the weight-
The responsability
