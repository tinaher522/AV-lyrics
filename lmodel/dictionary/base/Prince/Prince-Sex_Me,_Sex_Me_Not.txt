<song artist="Prince" title="Sex_Me,_Sex_Me_Not">
Sex me baby
Sex me not 
Sex me baby
Sex me not
Come 2 the afterparty 
Let's make it hot 
Leave your sister &amp; your underwear at home 
Ain't gonna stop until everybody gone 
Mmmm
Front row center
With the out-stretched hands 
More chill around  your wrist
Than the ice-cream man 
Speaking of which
U say u like it 
U say u like it when I SCREAM 
I like it when u do 2
Ooohhhh, uh huh 
Looky here now
Looky here now 
Ungh
Look at my hips 
(look at my hips) 
I'm about 2 do something
2 make your backbone slip 
Ungh, ungh, ungh
And when I get through 
U will be confused
Should u take another pill after morning? 
Or play the fool? 
Sex me baby
Sex me not 
Come 2 the afterparty 
(Come on) 
Let's make it hot 
(hot hot hot) 
Leave your sister &amp; your underwear at home 
Ain't gonna stop until everybody gone 
Come &amp; get happy
When I know u are here 
Make you go down in the back of the bus 
It's got a big ol' rear
Everybody that came 2 see me dance 
Jump back, watch me, I'm about to wet your pants 
Chorus 
Made a lot of money
Give it all 2 u 
(sex me) 
If u choose right
U can do what you're supposed 2 do 
Fly, black pepper
Grind u, grind u please 
Make a brother happy
On your knees 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
(sex me) 
Hold me tight
Check the burn 
And when the needle drop 
The groove u gonna hear 
Will never want 2 make u stop ya heard? 
Chorus 
Everybody
Hot Hot Hot
' Til everybody gone
What ' cha gonna do? 
SEX ME BABY SEX ME NOT
