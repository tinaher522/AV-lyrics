<song artist="Prince" title="The_Second_Coming">
It won't be long
All of God's children must learn 2 love
It won't be long (I said it won't be long)
Before the Second Coming, yeah
It won't be long, no, it won't be long
How many more good men must die before there's gun control
U've got 2 love your brother if U want 2 free your soul (Soul, soul, soul)
It won't be long (It won't be long)
All of God's, all of God's children must learn 2 love
