<song artist="Prince" title="Electric_Chair">
I saw your friend first
That's who I danced with
All the time I was watchin' U
The music rocked us
Our eyes locked thus
Makin' us see a trippy picture shoo
CHORUS:
Oh, if a man is considered guilty 4 what goes on in his mind
Then give me the electric chair 4 all my future crimes, oh!
U whispered something
It took my mind out
Like a G (G flat) major with the E in the bass
Your face looked so good
I wanted 2 touch your mouth
My brain is jackin' all over the place
CHORUS
Yeah, yeah {x2}
Let's take a drive, love
So we can make up our minds, love
2 commit the crimes of passion that sets us free
Me lovin' U, U lovin' me
Ow!
The electric chair!
I saw your friend first
That's who I danced with
All the time I was watchin' U (I was watchin' U)
The music rocked us
Our lives shocked us
Makin' us see a trippy picture shoo
I've got 2 have it! (Said I've got 2... yeah!)
If a man is considered guilty 4 what goes on in his mind (Guilty)
Then give me the electric chair 4 all my future crimes, oh!
U know I'm guilty, yeah? (4 all my future crimes, oh!)
I'm guilty, yeah! (4 all my future crimes, oh!)
And if U don't really love me! (Then give me the electric chair)
Ow!
The electric chair
