<song artist="Prince" title="The_Same_December">
Once was this ball with a line straight down the middle 
One side was black and the other one white 
And they both understood so little 
That they spent their whole lives tryin' 2 tell each other what time it was 
When all along it did not matter what either said because, because 
CHORUS: 
U only know what U know 
U only see what your heart will show 
U only love when your soul remembers 
We all come from the same December 
And in the end, that's where we'll go 
So let's go! 
Ooh yeah, oh yeah 
There once was a golden idol that went 2 the winners 
Needless 2 say it didn't make 'em feel any less a sinner 
Cuz the very next mornin' the whole damn world was the same 
Yes it was 
The idol still shinin', but the voice inside it said 
"There ain't no winners in this game" 
CHORUS 
Hey! 
There once was an angel who most certainly watched over me 
But if it got me through the day, is it crazy? 
Yeah, I'll be crazy 
Until the demons fall as far as anyone can fall 
When they reap what they done sowed, I'll be standin' tall 
We spend our whole lives tryin' 2 dog the other man 
When what we need 2 do is try 2 give him all we can 
But uh.. U only know what U know 
And uh.. U only see what your heart'll show 
And uh.. U only love when your soul remembers 
We all come from the same December 
And in the end, that's where we'll go 
So let's go! 
Let's go
