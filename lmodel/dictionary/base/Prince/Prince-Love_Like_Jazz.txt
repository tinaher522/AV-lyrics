<song artist="Prince" title="Love_Like_Jazz">
Hey baby what's your name?
Do you wanna play a game?
Play it like we don't know when
We'll ever get to play again
Experimental and so brand new
The things I wanna do with you
Like a physical kind of blue
Come on baby let's get to it
I want a lover that can improvise
I want a lover that can make me cry
Baby I don't care what you learned in lovemaking school
You and me we 'bout to jam
Make love like the first woman and man
I don't wanna know ahead of time
The notes you play should be a
Reaction to mine
Nothing planned or contrived
Then both of us will arrive
At our destination
I wanna feel like I've been hypnotized
If you think you can then let's go for a ride
Love like jazz, love like jazz, love like jazz
