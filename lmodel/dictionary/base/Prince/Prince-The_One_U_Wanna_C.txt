<song artist="Prince" title="The_One_U_Wanna_C">
Iknow I ain't the first to tell ya
I'm sure that I won't be the last
I know you're in a hurry baby
So let me make this fast
I got a lot of money
I don't want to spend it on me
I like pretty things
You're just as pretty as U can be
So, if U ain't busy later
And U want some company
I ain't trying to be a player
I'm the one, I'm the one
The one U wanna C
U wanna C
Look around U baby
U know U seen it all before
Every nickel in this club looking for a dime
Nothing less, nothing more
Too tall to be talked down to 
Too over it to be put under
???
That's why I don't like thunder
I got a lot of money

But I don't want to spend it on me
I like pretty things
And you're just as pretty as U can be
If U ain't busy later
And U want some company
I ain't tryin' to be your player
I'm the one, I'm the one
The one U wanna C
U wanna C
U don't need to fix your hair
4 somebody U don't care 4
U don't need to shave your legs
If it ain't me that's knockin' at your door
I know U ain't no concubine
I know U ain't a one-night stand
I don't want to waste your time
If U want to get creamy
I'm the one U wanna C
Ooh, the one U wanna C, baby
Oh, the one U wanna C
U wanna C me
I'm the U wanna C
The one U wanna C
I'm the U wanna C
