<song artist="Prince" title="Sweet_Baby">
Close ur eyes, sweet baby
Now don't u cry
Everybody gets their heart broke, sweet baby
Sometimes
So he left u 4 another fool
Yes, a fool
4 loving him from the start
Ask urself what's more important
Him or the broken pieces of ur heart?
Sweet baby
Stand tall, sweet baby
Now don't u fall
U ain't the only 1 getting beat down
It happens 2 us all
The road u choose to walk in this life
Is the 1 that leads in2 the next
So, sweet baby, stall tall
Stand tall
Sweet baby
Sweet baby
Hold ur tears back now
Better days gone come ur way soon, oh yes sweet baby
Some way, somehow
Oh, sweet baby
Walk faster, sweet baby
Don't let those bad boys catch u
Those things that they would have u do
U been done known better
Oh, and how
How can u sleep knowing that u and a fool
Sing in the same key?
Walk faster, sweet baby
Strive 2 b the best that u can b
Sweet baby
Oh, sweet baby
Sweet baby, hold ur tears back now
Better days gone come ur way soon
Oh yes, sweet baby
Some way, somehow
Oh, sweet baby
Better days gone come ur way, yeah
Sweet baby
