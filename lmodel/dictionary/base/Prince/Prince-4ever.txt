<song artist="Prince" title="4ever">
If I never get to hold your hand
If I never get to be your man
That's okay, 'cause I've got other plans
Right now, right now
If I never get to kiss your lips
If I never get to feel your hips close to me
That's okay, I ain't gonna trip
Not now, no how
'Cause I've got 4ever, 4ever
Eternity is just one kiss away
So they say
The opera just got all the fair
Cyprus, if I never get to take you swimming there
If you never know how much I care
I swear, it's not fair, no
If I never get to make you laugh
If we never get to take a bubble bath
See I don't wanna part with you, not tonight
Gonna be apart of my plans
I just want, I just want
Listen, I just want 4ever
Oh, I just want 4ever
Eternity is just one kiss away
What you say?
4ever
So many things we can do in the new world
I can be your future lover
You can be my future girl
If I never get to see your smile
Underneath a white veil walking up the isle
I just might go crazy, I might go wild
So let me tell you baby
Stop lookin' at me like that
Unless you're wanting me to bite that
4ever, 4ever
Eternity is just one kiss away
What you say?
4ever, 4ever
I don't want to kiss your lips
Till I get to, uh, your hips
