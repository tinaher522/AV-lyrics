<song artist="Prince" title="Soft_And_Wet">
Hey, lover, I got a sugarcane
That I wanna lose in you - Baby, can you stand the pain?
Hey, lover, sugar, don't you see?
There's so many things that you do to me...
Ooh, baby...
(Hey, lover...) All I wanna see is the love in your eyes,
And all I wanna hear is your sweet love sighs...
(Hey, lover...) All I ever feel is burning flame;
Tell me, tell me, baby, that you feel the same...
Tell me that you feel the same way I do;
Tell me that you love me, girl...
If this is lust, then I must confess I feel it every day;
If this is wrong, then I long to be as far from right as I may...
Soft and wet... 
Soft and wet...
Soft and wet...
Soft and wet...
Every time I'm with you, you just love me to death;
Ooo wee, baby, you leave me without
Breath... ooh, baby... 
Ooh, yeah...
(Hey, lover...) You're just as soft as a lion tamed,
And you're just as wet as the evening rain...
(Hey, lover...) I really dig it when you call my name;
Your love is driving me, you're driving me insane...
Crazy, baby, oh, girl, crazy 'bout your love...
Soft and wet... (You know...)
You are soft and wet... (For sure, girl...)
Your love is soft and wet...
Ooh, soft and wet...
Oh, oh, oh...
