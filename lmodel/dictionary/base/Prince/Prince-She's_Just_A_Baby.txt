<song artist="Prince" title="She's_Just_A_Baby">
She's just a baby, a baby
But she's my lady
My lover, my only friend
She's just a baby
But maybe she'll understand
That I am made of a true love
That will never end (Hey, hey)
People don't understand what she sees in an older man
They never stop 2 think that maybe I'm what she's lookin' 4
They never take the time 2 look into her mind
They just keep on sayin' she's just a baby
But maybe one day they will see
She's not such a baby, no baby is she
She's just in love with me
She's just a baby, a baby
But she's my lady
I know there are some things she'll never see
She's just a baby
But maybe one day she'll see
Although she's young
She's the only one that can bring out the man in me
Can't U see? Yeah
People don't understand what she sees in this lonely man
Don't they know that everybody needs somebody sometime? Oh
I give her all I can
But the people don't give a damn
They just keep on sayin' that she's just a baby
But maybe one day they will see
She's not such a baby, no baby is she
She's just in love with me
Oh no, no, no, yeah
