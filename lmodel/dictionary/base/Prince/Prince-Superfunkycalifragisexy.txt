Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ...!
Ow!
If your body needs water, keep dancin'
Cuz U oughta keep the blood flowin' down 2 your feet
Brother Maurice'll be 'round in a minute
With a bucket filled in it - squirrel meat
The blood real good if U drink it real fast
But the aftertaste just lasts and lasts
So if U kiss somebody, U wanna party all night (Alright!)
Superfunkycalifragisexy, oh! Ahh! {x2}
See, if U do 2 much, your skin'll be sensitive 2 the touch
The first person that touch U, U wanna fuck
U take 'em 2 your crib and U tie 'em 2 a chair
And U make funny faces till they get real scared
Then U turn on the neon, then U play with yourself
Till U turn 'em on
Superfunkycalifragisexy, oh! Ahh! {x2}
This beat is on time
Refined and designed 2 make U do the do
Superfunkycalifragisexy
This chair goes round and round
I feel like a clown cuz I'm stripped down
It's all fun and games till the very next day
Till, damn, U don't remember my name
Maybe I'll see U next Thursday night
Maybe I won't, but that's alright
Cuz in my possession there's a signed confession that says
I was the best U'd ever had
2 bad (Ow!)
This beat is on time
Refined designed 2 make U do the do
Superfunkycalifragisexy, oh! Ahh! {x2}
Baby, keep the blood flowin' down 2 your feet
Brother Maurice'll be 'round in a minute
Superfunkycalifragisexy, uh
Superfunkycalifragisexy
This beat is on time
Refined and designed 2 make U do the do
Superfunkycalifragisexy
In 7 measures, I want somebody 2 scream
Superfunkycalifragisexy
If your body needs water, keep dancin'
Cuz U oughta keep the blood flowin' down 2 your feet
Brother Maurice'll be around in a minute
With a bucket filled in it - squirrel meat
If U can't beat 'em, join 'em
Slammin'!
This beat is on time
All of the time
So refined
Specially designed 2 make U do the do (2 make U do the do)
Super...
In 7 measures, I... I want somebody 2...
