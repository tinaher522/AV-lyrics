Take off your clothes

Bet u got a body, by god
Come on, let me see
U oughta
My camera's gonna get u when u get it good and wet
U oughta let me come and pet u so it lasts, baby
319
Can i see it, baby? (mmm) ow!
I got a good shot, put your leg on the chair (like that?)
U know u're 2 hot when u play with your hair (ha ha ha)
I like it
I just wanna holler, scream, and shout
When u let your fingers do the walkin' in and out and all about
319
Ah hoochie, don't do that
U.. u.. u make me wanna dance!
Now watch this
Lock the door and kill the phone
My camera, u and me alone
Will make a picture all will see and go
"ow, 319"
Oh baby, how'd u get your legs 2 do that?
Ooh shit
(319) {repeat in bg}
319
U're just 2 mean
319
Yeah, yeah, go on girl
Mmmmmmmm!
Ain't gotta tell u cuz u already know
Girl, u in the house so keep runnin' that show
Go on girl
Yeah
Come here
Have u ever kissed another woman on the dance floor?
Come here, where u goin'?
Come here
