<song artist="Prince" title="I_Like_Funky_Music">
[Chorus:]
(I like funky music)
(I like funky music)
(I like funky music)
(I like funky music)
Everybody get on the floor
We got the groove you feel in your soul
When you're good 'n' funky, you can say you know
Dance to the funky music, come on
[Chorus]
If you ain't got no partner you can use your hair
Shake it like a hooker, baby, I don't care
Whatever you do, you got to make the people stare
Dance to the funky music, yeah
[Chorus]
This beat I got is specially designed (Specially designed)
To make you lose your phone number to somebody fine
The nastier you get, the funkier we got
My claim to fame is scandal, baby, and I ain't here to stop (Ow!)
(I like funky music)
(I like funky music)
I didn't come to trample on what you think is cool
I just wanna hip you to a brand new groove
If you like your funky mellow, this ain't for you
Dance to the funky music, shoo-bed-ooh!
Yeah
[Chorus]
Uh-huh (Uh!)
Uh, uh, uh-huh
Uh, uh-huh
Uh, uh, uh-huh
Yo, the time has come once again to send
A dance groove that won't end
Don't pretend that your feet is tired
And grab my hand girlfriend
And move it, baby, move it
I know you can do it
Move it, baby, move it
I know you can do it, come on
I said come on
[Chorus]
Now let me tell you somethin'
Huh, lookin' so good on the floor
Make me wanna get to know you better
And dancin' all up next to you
Is a feeling I can feel forever
Being together and doing what's clever
And been so hard to stop it, uh
I know no one could top it
Huh, yeah
This groove is funky
Huh, yeah
Yo N.P.G. drop it!
Huh, say what?
Huh, huh, say what?
Say, say what? Uh, uh, uh
Say, say, say what? Huh, uh, uh, uh
Yo, enough respect goes to The Artist and the N.P.G. crew
And the whole New York and Uptown
And across the country massive
Big up yourselves cuz it's comin' at cha loud
Alright?
