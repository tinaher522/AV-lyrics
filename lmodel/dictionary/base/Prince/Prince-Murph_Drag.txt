<song artist="Prince" title="Murph_Drag">
Fellas (yeah), I'm back (back) {fade in}
The aristocratic black (black)
My whip ain't got no crack (crack)
But it got a hell of a bang (hell of a bang)
Fellas (yeah), I'm back (back)
The aristocratic black (black)
My whip ain't got no crack (crack)
But it got a hell of a bang (it's got a hell of a bang)
(What time is it?) {repeat in song)
(Come on) {repeat "777-9311" sample in song}
Everybody get ready
We got a brand new groove
Everybody cold listen
I'm gonna show U what 2 do
Kick your left on the beat y'all
Drag the other one behind
If U really wanna be hip
Then stick out your bottom lip
Now U're jammin' fine
CHORUS:
Murph Drag - Only people with money can do this dance
Can do this dance
Murph Drag - My bank roll's gettin' heavy
My bank roll's gettin' heavy in my pants
Murph Drag - Aristocratic dreams, aristocratic dreams
All the fine ladies scream
Murph Drag - Only people with money can do this dance
Can do this dance
Ho! (Murph...)
Count it
They can't mess with U, M.D. (...Drag)

Put it up
Go'n my brotha, tell 'em what time it is
Everybody get ready
We got a brand new cool
Everybody cold listen
I'm gonna show U what 2 do
But U can't talk 2 pinnacles
U can't talk 2 a gun
We are building up a brand new nation
Business is on the floor
CHORUS
(Put it up)
(We hittin', we hittin')
(Murph Drag) {repeat in BG}
I got a PhD in common sense
Can't nobody mess with me
The original jam operator
I could sell a forest trees (Yount!)
U dance 2 hard, baby (Go'n and tell her Morris)
I might cop a sweat
Y'all keep on dancin'
I'll be on this side
Winkin', blinkin', sneakin', makin' your lady wet
(Get sleazy y'all)
Murph Drag - Only people with money can do this dance
Can do this dance
(Testin' right, we hittin', we hittin', hit me now)
Murph Drag - My bank roll's gettin' heavy
My bank roll's gettin' heavy in my pants
(Murph Drag) {repeat in BG}
Fellas (yeah), I'm back (back)
The aristocratic black (black)
My whip ain't got no crack (crack)
But it got a hell of a bang (hell of a bang)
Fellas (yeah), I'm back (back) {repeat 2 times}
The aristocratic black (black)
My whip ain't got no crack (crack)
But it got a hell of a bang (got a hell of a bang)
America (yeah), I'm back (back)
The aristocratic black (black)
My whip ain't got no crack (crack)
But it got a hell of a bang (hell of a bang)
(Murph Drag - Only people with money can do this dance)
Listen, I got something 2 lay on y'all
It's about a new cool education (Talk 2 'em cousin)
Education - U're buildin' up a brand new nation
Your own block is the sole foundation
(Murph Drag)
Business on the 1 y'all
Get with it
(Egor)
Pull {sample}
{samples repeat}
What time is it?
