<song artist="Prince" title="Love_U,_But_Dont_Trust_U_Anymore">
I could tell from the moment you walked in the room
That it wasn't your dress you had on, that wasn't your perfume
And what happened to the ring that I gave you?
What am I to assume?
I love u, but I just don't trust u anymore
You could tell from the moment you looked in my eyes
That I could see right through
You must apologize, I've always given you the best in life
Even in the wrong, it was right
I know you trust me, but you don't love me anymore, no
I remember meeting you here in the good ol' days
I would never pick the flower of my favorite protege
Maybe if I would have, then you would not treat me this way
You tricked me, but you will not anymore
No, no, I love u, but I don't trust u anymore
