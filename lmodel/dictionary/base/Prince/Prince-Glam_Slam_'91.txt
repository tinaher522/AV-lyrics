Glam Slam
Everybody grab a body, pump it like U want somebody {x2}
CHORUS:
Glam Slam
Everybody grab a body, pump it like U wanna party
Glam Slam
Everybody grab a body, pump it like U wanna party
Hey little girly, don't U wait
I can see U had a hard day
Come on baby, let your hair down
Come on, dance 2 the funky sound (Oh)
CHORUS
Hey little girly, what U say?
Swing that big ol' hip this way
I can show U how 2 do it
Grab my body, let's get 2 it (Oh)
CHORUS
Hey little girly, what U drinkin'?
Skip that, I was just thinkin'
U + me, what a ride
If U was thinkin' the same, we could continue outside
Lay your pretty body against the parkin' meter
Flip your dress down like I was strippin' a Peter Paul's Almond Joy
Let me show U, baby, I'm a talented boy
Everybody grab a body, pump it like U want somebody {x3}
(I'm a talented boy) {x2}
Glam slam
Mmm, we could kiss in front of everybody
I don't care, that's right, I pulled your dress up
Shit, U ain't got no underwear on
I should've known, I should've known
Butterscotch curly hair, I wish U had some drawers on now
Stone freak 2 the bone
I can't believe it
Girl, we goin' home
Everybody grab a body, pump it like U want somebody {x2}
Glam Slam
So, here we are, here we are in my Paisley crib
Whatcha want 2 eat?
No toy, I don't serve ribs
U better be happy that dress is still on
I heard the rip when U sat down
Honey, them hips is gone
But that's al... - I clock 'em, clock 'em that way
Remind me of somethin' James used to say:
"I like 'em fat, I like 'em proud"
U gotta have a mother 4 me
Now move your big ass around this way
So I can work on that zipper, baby
2night I'm a star and U're the Big Dipper
Glam Slam
Everybody grab a body, pump it like U wanna party
Everybody grab a body {x2}
Can I interest U in (this here) Duke?
The past could be useful in the moment of truth
If I'm keepin', things ain't what they use 2 be
And I catch U hummin' along, I know U're 4 the greed
But it's cool because 2 me U look 17
Yeah, I got a lot of nerve, I color it green
I wanna put U in a love machine
But first I wanna scream, first I wanna scream
Scream about the way U really make me feel
No need 4 respect cuz U 4ever get the seal of approval
Yeah, I know U ain't a tramp
I watched 5 guys get their faces slapped
I count 3 more askin' U 2 dance
The rap must have truly been tired and bland
U couldn't wear the look that had all 3 runnin'
Girl, I must confess your finesse is stunnin'
Everybody grab a body, pump it like U want somebody {x2}
CHORUS
(Slammin')
Glam Slam (Hey)
Everybody grab a body, pump it like U want somebody
Everybody grab a body, pump it like U wanna party
Glam Slam
Everybody grab a body, pump it like U wanna party
Glam Slam
