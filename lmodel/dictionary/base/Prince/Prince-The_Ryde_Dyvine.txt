<song artist="Prince" title="The_Ryde_Dyvine">
Ryde dyvine, ryde dyvine
Explore your mind, explore your mind
Ryde dyvine, ryde dyvine
Explore your mind, explore your mind
Are U ready 4 the ryde dyvine?
Th-th-then get on up and let it move your mind
What U get is what U think U see
If U're ready come explore your mind and be
Let's do it
Feel the music pumpin' bass in your face
This must be the party, yeah, this must be the place
Ain't nobody got no business up on the wall
Unless U're ground and tryin' 2 find a reason 4 it all
Let's do it
Are U ready 4 the ryde dyvine?
Then get on up and let it move your mind (Let's do it)
What U get is what U think U see
If U're ready come explore your mind
Everywhere I go my people's 40 colors strong
Keep my body moving, yeah that's when we get along
When the music stop and all my people look around
What they see is a box of crayons: black, white, red and brown
Hey
Are U ready 4 the ryde dyvine? (Are U ready?)
Get on up and let it move your mind (Let's do it)
Are U ready?
Explore your mind and be
Let's do it {x2}
Everybody's talkin' 'bout this brand new funky sound
Good old gospel funk'n'roll has always been around
What difference does it make if it don't make the f... charts?
All that matters is the way U feel it in your heart
Let's do it
Are U ready 4 the ryde dyvine? (Are U ready?)
Get on up and let it move your mind (Let's do it)
What U get is what U think U see
If U're ready come explore your mind and be
Let's do it
Hey hey, let's do it
Rainbow couples in the corner kiss without a care
U can look (look) 4ever (4ever) as long as U don't stare (don't stare)
Fathers speak of separation, what the mothers say?
F... that noise, come on y'all, let's go dance the night away
Let's do it {x2}
(Are U ready?)
Are U ready 4 the ryde dyvine?
Let's do it
Are U ready 4 the ryde dyvine? (Hey)
Are U ready 4 the ryde dyvine?
Then get on up and let it move your mind
What U get is what U think U see
If U're ready come explore your mind and be
Let's do it
Explore your mind and be
Let's do it {fade out}
