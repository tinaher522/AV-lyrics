<song artist="Prince" title="Glass_Cutter">
This is a story about a One and Only mother, 
There never was before, and there'll never be another, 
Heck-a motor scooterâ¦ so fine U wanna shoot her, 
Dressed like butter, hold a Cup-a Glass Cutter 
Glass Cutter 
Ohhhâ¦ yeah! 
This is a jam about a purple fantasy 
Every man knows this how it's supposed to be 
So sharp, make a brother heart go flutter 
Dress holding on to a Cup-a Glass Cutter 
Mmmâ¦Glass Cutter 
Oww 
Oww 
It's about as hard as Arabian math 
Water drops dripping when you taking a bath 
the towel unravel and it looks like gravel 
all a brother can do is just laughâ¦ (ugh!) 
But under his breath, he gonna mutter, 
But under his breath, he gonna mutter, 
But under his breath, he gonna mutterâ¦ 
Baby, got a Cup-a Glass Cutter. 
(Clapping) 
This about a mother got a brother sprung, 
I looked up the word heavenâ¦ saw a picture of her tongue, 
If she was a song, she'd be sung. 
Sit around and I'll be a singer, so I can bring her - 
parmesan, cheddar, cheese... please. 
U better believe she gets what she wants, 
'cause I want just what she got. 
I'm a new car, and she's a lotâ¦ a whole lot o' woman! 
(clapping) 
Girl got a case of 2 Fine 
She got it badâ¦ and that's good. 
I'm gonna tell her 2 her faceâ¦ (gonna tell her 2 her face) 
'cause another brother wouldâ¦ 
when a mother make a brother heart go flutter. 
Dressed like butter, 
Cup-a Glass cutter 
Dressed like butter, 
Cup-a Glass cutter 
U make my heart go flutter, 
Cup-a Glass Cutter 
U make my heart go flutter... 
Glass Cutter.
