<song artist="Prince" title="Oobey_Doop">
Oobey shoo doo loo be doo
Loo fly me shoo koo doo ooh
Hey yeah!
Every time I turn around
There's another war tryin' 2 bring me down
Nobody ever told me what I'm fightin' 4
They just tell me get in line
Change my clothes, change my mind
It's 110 and I'm just gettin' bored
Maybe we should be dancin' {x2}
U make me say oobey doop be shoo ooh
Doo fly me shoo doo koo ooh
U make say oobey doop be shoo ooh
Doo fly me shoo doo koo ooh
I don't mean no disrespect
But the way I see it, this is a mess
It's got your butt in a sho'nuff dirty jam
If I could just make believe
Make U holler on your knees
Praying 4 somethin' 2 make U understand
Maybe we should be dancin' {x2}
CHORUS:
I can't help but say oobey doop be shoo ooh
Doo fly me shoo doo koo ooh
I can't help but say oobey doop be shoo ooh
Doo fly me shoo doo koo ooh
Maybe we should be dancin'
(Oobey doop be doop be shoo)
Sooner or later, your ways will tumble
Just might take an all night rumble
Might take a piece of New Power cake
But if U cut away the war, hearts will break
Hearts will break
Maybe we should be dancin'
Dance (Ooh, ooh, ooh ooh)
Every time I turn around
There's another war tryin' 2 bring me down
Nobody ever told me what I'm fightin' 4
CHORUS
Maybe we should be dancin'
{Parts of CHORUS repeat}
Baby, baby
Maybe we should be dancin'
U make me say...
Maybe we should be dancin'
Oobey doop be shoo ooh
Doo fly me shoo doo koo ooh
I can't help but say oobey doop be shoo ooh
Doo fly me shoo doo koo ooh
Maybe we should be dancin'
