<song artist="Prince" title="Love_2_The_9's">
U say that u love me like a river
A river u say will never run dry
I'd rather hear u say 4ever
Instead of a smile I'd rather c u cry
Don't use that magical, mysterious,
Intoxicating joy,
Fantastic, fascinating
Word called love
Unless u love me 2 the 9's
This is the only kind of love
That I've been dreaming of
The kind of love that takes away
Ur body, mind, and soul
Love 2 the 9's, baby
I wanna b loved 2 the 9's
I wanna b loved, sugar
I wanna b loved 4 all time
Baby, take a real good look at my face
'Cause honey, it just might b the last time
Maybe u should have played an ace
Instead u played the queen
U'd b better off cheating
Than trying 2 read my mind
Don't use that magical, mysterious,
Intoxicating joy,
Fantastic, fascinating
Word called love
Unless u love me 2 the 9's
This is the only kind of love
That I've been dreaming of
The kind of love that takes away
Ur body, mind, and soul
Love 2 the 9's, baby
I wanna b loved 2 the 9's
I wanna b loved, sugar
I wanna b loved 4 all time
Love me 2 the 9's
Stay awake 4 14 hours
Listen 2 the band
A new power soul
We got 2 get with this
Dancing 2 the beat 'til we lose our mind control
Can I get a witness?
Looking 4 a lover with a body that says
Some mo'
I wanna c that booty boom
B4 I even let her get close enough 2 smell perfume
I'm looking 4 A.P.H.D.
Ass Piled High and Deep, you c?
I can't help it
Like honey 2 a bee
And if the booty boom, she gone come with me
And then T'll whip out a thirty second questionnaire
Machine gun a sister like he just don't care
Machine gun a sister like he just gotta
Just gotta, just gotta...hit it!
Name:  "Arabia"
Age:   "Jailbait"
Occupation, if any:  "Sex Symbol 2 many but I really got a beautiful mind"
Fine, fine
What sign u r?  "Stop sign"
Well what's ur favorite...car  "Green...Rolls Royce"
How many kids u got?  "Egad!  God, I'm shocked!"
How many books u read?  "Is Hemingway dead?"
Who's the president now?  "Does it matter...wow!"
Then how u gonna make that booty boom?
"How I'm gonna make that booty boom?"
I said how u gonna make that booty boom?
"How?  I'm gonna make that booty boom.
"Step back - give a girl some room!"
Dance girl, let me c that booty boom
Dance girl, let me c that booty boom
Dance girl, let me c that booty boom
Dance girl, let me c that booty boom
Yo, check this out
Would u hug me on a crowded street?
Could u keep ur cool if I washed ur feet?
And ur soul a bath,
What if I gave it?
Ur body I asked,
How long could u save it?
Would u lie down on a bed of thorns
While I drink ur ocean dry?
And if we said we loved each other,
Instead of smiling, would u cry?
Could u kiss 3 times with ur dress upside down,
Stroking, laughing?
Or would u stay awake 4 14 hours
Listening 2 the grass grow?
I ask thee:
Would u, could u, will u
Love me 2 the 9's?
Would u, could u, will u
Love me 4 all time?
Would u, could u, will u
Love me 2 the 9's
"I'll love u 2 the 9's"
Hunh...2 the 9's
Hunh...4 all time
Wanna b in love 2 the 9's
Wanna b loved 4 all time
You gotta, you gotta love me 2 the 9's
Wanna be in love 4 all time, yeah
Oooooh oh, 2 the 9's, 2 the 9's, 2 the 9's
2 the 9's, 2 the 9's, 2 the 9's
Hey yea!
