<song artist="Prince" title="Love">
Ooh! {x2}
Ow!
Stop telling me what U want me 2 hear
Stop telling me what U want me 2 fear
Stop tripping on somethin' U overheard
Love is winning without a word
Stop giving me your wish list
Love is free from all this
CHORUS:
Like a bird flyin' over the hilltops
Love is like the sky, U know it never stops
From the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks
Love is whatever, whatever U want it 2 be
Love is not a game U can play on the floor
U gotta stop keeping score
(If U wanna) If U wanna play me like U did b4
U better stop and walk out the door
We could skate around the issues if U like
But who's gon' get U high in the middle of the night?
CHORUS
Oh
Whoa whoa oh
Oh
I see U standing wit' your back on the wall
U better, better get your hands up and clap if that's all
And uh, if U don't wanna get yours, then let me get mine
See, ain't gonna be no drama cuz we have a good time
What's the point in giving me ultimatums?
Smilin' at my friends when U really hate 'em
Tryin' 2 convince me that I should 2
What's the point?
Stop worryin' about what people say
When U ain't gon', ain't gonna stop 'em anyway, uh
Love can do anything if U try
Come on, spread your wings and let's fly, uh
Fly so high, fly, flyin' over the hilltops
Love is like the sky, U know it never stops (Ain't gonna stop, now)
From the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks (Speak 2 me)
Love is whatever, whatever, whatever...
CHORUS
(Speak 2 me, uh)
(Talking 'bout love now)
Whatever U want it 2 be {x3}
(Talking 'bout love, now)
Alright, let's skate!
Uh!
Come on,
I see U standin' wit' your back on the wall
U better get your hands up and clap if that's all
If U don't wanna get yours, then let me get mine
See, ain't gonna be no drama cuz we have a good time
Bounce!
Ah, shake that thang, come on
Ah, bounce it, baby
Ah, shake that thang, come on
Good God!
