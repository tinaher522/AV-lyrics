<song artist="Prince" title="Bliss">
The sky looks like it's turnin'
Turnin' from blue 2 black
Still I feel the sun is burnin'
Hot monkey on my back
Am I in a speeding car?
Am I lying in your bed?
One kiss from U is all that I do
And I'm outta my head (My head, my head)
Bliss
This is heaven, I swear 2 God
Wish that I could spend everynight with this feeling some more
Bliss
Just as sure as this lighted candle
I can handle anything
Don't hold nothin' back
2night baby, U're the king
Birds are singin', mindbells are ringin'
I can see everything
We should take a moment
2 praise the heavens above
Every man should be so lucky (So lucky)
So lucky 2 be in love
Bliss
The sky is turnin'
Turnin' from blue 2 black (Black)
Bliss
Can't U feel the sun burnin'?
Hot monkey on my back (Back)
Get off!
Am I in a speeding car?
Am I lying in your bed?
One kiss from U is all that I do
And I'm outta my head (I'm outta my head)
Oh bliss
This is heaven, I swear 2 God
Wish that I could spend everynight with this feeling some more
Oh bliss
This is heaven, I swear 2 God
I wish that I could spend... this feeling, this feeling
Oh bliss
This is heaven, I swear 2 God {fade out}
Wish I could spend everynight, all night with this ...
