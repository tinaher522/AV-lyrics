<song artist="Prince" title="Why_Should_I_Love_You?">
this chapter says, put it out of your mind
and give it time
the violent purple
the purest gold
the red of the sacred heart
the grey of the ghost
the "l" of the lips are open
to the "o" of the host
the "v" of the velvet
CHORUS
of all the people in the world
why should I love you?
there's just something bout you
there's just something bout you
of all the people in the world
why should I love you?
have you ever seen a picture
of Jesus laughing
mmm do you think
he had a beautiful smile
a smile that healed
CHORUS
of all the people in the world
CHORUS
of all the people in the world
why should I love you
(why should I love you)
why should I love you
(why should I love you)
REPEAT TO FADE
