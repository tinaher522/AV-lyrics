<song artist="Prince" title="She_Loves_Me_4_Me">
With this 1 I can be what I wanna be
I don't have 2 live up 2 no one's fantasy
I could write another 300 melodies
2 her it's just 3 cuz this 1, she loves me 4 me
With this 1 I don't even have 2 comb my hair
I can wear what I want 2 or nothing, she don't care
I don't even have 2 take her on the rollercoaster see
Cuz this 1, this 1, she loves me 4 me.
In the mornin' when I rise and I see her eyes, look deep into mine
I find a better place, ohh
This 1 I can tell all my secrets 2
I don't need 2 make her swear she would never tell anywho
besides I'm the only 1 she ever really wants 2 see
Cuz this 1, honestly, she loves me 4 me
When the night falls, and she calls I run 2 her side
Cuz she got the ride that I like 2 ride.  I like 2 ride it.
This 1 I can take over my momma's house
And I don't have 2 worry what goes in and out her mouth
All she needs is just a little gratuity
She don't like no beef, Uh, she just loves me 4 me.
She just loves me 4 me.  
This 1, this 1, ohhh
She loves me 4 me.
