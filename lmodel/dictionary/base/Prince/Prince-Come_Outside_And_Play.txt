<song artist="Prince" title="Come_Outside_And_Play">
Can U come outside and play?!
Give me your name and number
Give me the keys 2 your ride
Put the top down
Let me cruise up the ocean side
Let me put my arm around U
Unsnap your self-consciousness
Take off everything except your stockings
I wanna kiss U more or less
Can U come outside and play? {"Play" repeats is BG of song}
Tell me baby, what do U say?
I got a bet goin' with my partner
That U're the best kisser in L.A.
If I'm, uh, out of line, U can tell me
But if I'm not, we can get busy
Come on baby, tell me what do U say?
Can U come outside and play?
Play! Play!
Take off everything except your stockings
I wanna kiss U more or less {x3}
I wanna.. I wanna.. I wanna..
I wanna, wanna, wanna, wanna, wanna, wanna, wanna play!
I got a bet goin' with my partner
That U're the best kisser in L.A.
Come on baby, come on baby
Come on, come outside and play {x3}
Play
(Can U come outside and play?)
Come outside and play!
(Play) {x8}
(Can U come outside and play?)
(Play) {x15}
(Can U come..)
(Can U come..)
(Can U come outside..)
(Can U come outside and play?)
U'll be fine {segue}
We can withstand the test of time
It's all or nothing
Everything we do
Even when I can't be
Can't be with U
It doesn't mean U're any farther away
Just means we're still prisoners
Not entirely free
There's a new age dawning
Slowly opening heaven's door
Contrary 2 rumour
Heaven is keeping score
The New Power Generation has just taken control
