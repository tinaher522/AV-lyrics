(W, X, Y, Z)
"Hey, it's the man!"
"Yeah, let's see what's going on!"
Hey, hey
CHORUS:
Trust - who do ya?
Trust - what makes U a real lover?
Trust - I put this question 2 ya cuz I want U 2 be with me
Love - U cannot imagine
How much I wanna give 2 U
Hot - I get so excited
Just thinkin' about all we could do
Dig it now
Another world awaits us
Another power 2 see
Close - don't worry about nobody else
From now on U'll be here with me
CHORUS
Money - how much'll make U happy?
U can have it all if it'll suit U right
Nothin', I said nothin' can take the place
Of U and me kickin' it tight, tight
Come - it's easy
Just let yourself go, don't put up a fight
Sex - it's not that type of party (Higher, higher, higher)
Girl, we're gettin' higher 2 night (Oh Lord)
CHORUS
Yeah, ooh
Come on
Alright
Sho'nuff tell it everybody
"Get 'em! Take the pictures!"
"Gotham's greed"
Ooh!
Yeah
Trust
Hot and close, dig it now
Ooh, that feels good
Ha, ha, ha
CHORUS
Oh yeah
Ow! My Lord! (Trust)
When I'm on, I feel good (Trust)
Good Lord
When I'm, when I'm on, I feel good (Trust)
Who do ya trust if U can't trust God?
Who can U trust - who can ya?
Who do ya trust if U can't trust God?
Who can U trust - who can ya?
Come and see
Trust - who do ya?
Trust - what makes U a real lover?
Trust - I put this question 2 ya cuz I want U 2 be.... wait
Want cha with me, ooh
{Repeat 2 fade}
(Trust)
Who do ya trust if U can't trust God?
Who can U trust - who can ya?
