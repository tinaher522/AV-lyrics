La da da da da da da da {x2}
There comes a time in every man's life
When he gets tired of foolin' around
Juggling hearts in a 3-ring circus
Some day drive a body down 2 the ground
I never imagined that love would rain on me
And make me wanna settle down
But baby, it's true, I think I do
And I just wanna tell U that I wanna with U (And baby, if U do 2)
And baby, if U do 2
Oh 4ever, 4ever
Baby, I want U 4ever
I wanna keep U 4 the rest of my life (U can make right)
All that is wrong in my world, U can make right
(U are my savior, U are my light)
U are my savior, U are my light (4ever I want U in my life)
4ever I want U in my life (La da da da da da da da)
(La da da da da)
(Every man's journey)
There comes a road in every man's journey (Don't be afraid)
A road that he's afraid 2 walk on his own, yeah (I'm at that road)
I'm here 2 tell U that I'm at that road
(And I'd rather walk with U than walk it alone)
And I'd rather walk it with U than walk it alone (U are my future)
U are my hero, U are my future (No past)
When I am with U, I have no past
Oh baby, my one and only desire (Make this feelin' last)
Is find some way in this doggone world 2 make this feelin' last
(Sugar, it's true)
(I know I do)
Oh baby, it's true ... huh, I know I do (Wanna with U)
And I just wanna tell U that I wanna with U, yeah
Baby, if U do 2
Oh 4ever, 4ever
I want U baby, baby, 4ever (U can make right)
I wanna keep U 4 the rest of my life
(U are my savior, U are my light)
All that's wrong in my world, mama, U can make right
(4ever I want U in my life)
U are my savior, U are my light (La da da da da da da da)
4ever I want U in my life (La da da da da da da da)
(La da da da da da da da)
(La da da da da)
4ever in my life {x2}
