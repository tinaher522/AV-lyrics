Upload: the evolution principle
You see a rock on the shore and say 
"It's always been there" 
Download: no responsibility 
Do what you want nobody cares 
Upload: the master race idea 
Genetically disposed to rule the world 
Download: a future full of isolated 
Full of isolated boys and girls 
Upload: a two-party system 
The lesser of two dangers 
Illusion of choice 
Download: a veiled form of fascism 
Nothing really ever changes 
You never had a voice 
If you look, you're sure gonna find 
Throughout mankind's history 
A colonized mind 
The one in power makes law 
Under which the colonized fall 
But without God it's just the blind leading the blind 
Upload: a joint venture record deal 
It's just another way for the man to steal 
While he's sticking you with the bill 
Download: the temporary acquisition of fleeting fame and fortune 
Nothing to leave in your will 
Upload: a child with no father 
Download: no respect for authority 
Upload: a child with no mother 
Download: a hard time showing love 
If you look, you're sure gonna find 
Throughout mankind's history 
A colonized mind 
The one in power makes law 
Under which the colonized fall 
But without God it's just the blind leading the blind
