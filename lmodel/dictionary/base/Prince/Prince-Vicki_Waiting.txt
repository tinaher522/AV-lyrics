<song artist="Prince" title="Vicki_Waiting">
"I'm of a mind 2 make some mookie, heh heh... phonebook"
The phone rings - it's Vicki callin'
She wants me 2 come 2 the crib
U see, conversation's better than being lonely
So I try my best 2 ad lib
I tell her the joke about the woman
Who asked her lover - "Why is your organ so small?"
He replied, "I didn't know I was playin' in a cathedral"
Vicki didn't laugh at all
This is where she wants 2 be
And I am what she wants 2 see
I've never known a love so sweet
But still I keep Vicki waiting
Alright
All is well in Gotham City
The sound of terror is all U hear
Sometime a pistol take the place of her body
Sometimes her body's here
U see, when crime is your only love
All that matters - the present, the here and now
People, people - whatever floats this Joker's boat
Is whatever this Joker will bang
CHORUS:
This is where she wants 2 be (I...)
I am what she wants 2 see
Never known a love so sweet
Still I keep Vicki waiting
Oh yeah
Wait on, mama
Talk of children still frightens me
Is my character enough 2 be? (Never)
One that deserves a copy made? (Never, never)
This I one day, I hope 2 see
Until then she's held at bay by my animal-like persistence
Or maybe she's just 2 proud 2 say
That fate (fate) brought us 2gether
And this is where she wants 2 stay
CHORUS {x2}
(Oh)
(Oh yeah)
(Ah yeah, yeah, yeah)
All is well in Gotham Town (This is where she wants 2 be)
I am what she wants 2 see
I've never known a love so sweet
But still I keep Vicki...
Still I keep Vicki...
Still I keep Vicki waiting, oh yeah (Waiting)
Uh-huh, uh-huh
Still I keep Vicki...
Still I keep Vicki waiting
This is where she wants 2 be
