<song artist="Prince" title="777-9311">
Baby, what's your phone number?
I know I'm kinda fast, but I hate 2 waste time
Baby, what's your phone number?
Girl, I have 2 ask cuz U're so fine
CHORUS:
777-9311
I wanna spend the night with U if that's alright
777-9311
Ooh baby, please can I come 2 night?
Baby, what's your phone number?
How can U be reached on a lonely night?
Baby, what's your phone number?
How can I get into U when I'm feeling right?
CHORUS
Jellybean
Ain't nothin' worse than rejection
I'd feel a little better if U slapped my face
Hey, what's your phone number?
Can't U see the agony I'm goin' through?
Baby, what's your phone number?
Girl, it's getting hard baby, won't U let me love U, love U?
CHORUS
Yeah, ooh
Hey baby,what's your phone number?
I know it sounds fast, but I ain't got all night
Come on baby, what's your phone number?
U know I got 2 be cooler than this cat U're sittin' with
I'll do U right, baby
Come on! {x3}
Oh no, come on!
Oh, hey
CHORUS
Come 2 night if it's alright (777-9311)
Honey, please can I come 2 night?
Can't U see what I'm gonna do? (777-9311)
I wanna do it 2 night, baby, I wanna do it 2 U
It's on fire, U burn me out (777-9311)
It's getting higher, U know what I'm talkin' about
Help me out good Lord above (777-9311)
Marry me girl, give me some of that love
Terry
