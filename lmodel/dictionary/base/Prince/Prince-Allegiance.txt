<song artist="Prince" title="Allegiance">
In my sleepin' R.E.M. state, U are on my mind, love
If I'm workin', if I'm playin', U're with me all the time, love
Your languid body, how it moves me mysterious ways, yeah
If I'm happy or if I'm sad, it moves me every day, love
Baby, whatever U got, don't stop it
Honey, U're makin' me hot and I want it
I'm in a deep blue funk but I like it
I'm addicted 2 your junk and I'm dyin'
Every day, love, at 6:30 my body gets so cool
I shiver madly, girl, I'd glady be your night time fool, love
All the honey and all the cash that this world has 2 give
Couldn't compare 2 one strand of your hair - girl, I wanna live (with U)
Baby, whatever U got, don't stop it
Honey, U're makin' me hot and I want it
I'm in a deep blue funk but I like it
I'm addicted 2 your junk and I'm dyin', dyin'
Girl, I'm dyin'
Smooth hands, cocoa tan
Your biggest fan I am
More than any man, I can and I will until time stops
Or whatever U got discontinues
So 4 U and all that is good and true
I hereby state my allegiance
4 U and all that is true
I hereby state my allegiance
