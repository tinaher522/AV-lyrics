<song artist="Prince" title="Hey_Louie_Louie">
Yeah, Louie's rap - take 1
We got a funky one
Take me out 2 the ballpark - strike 1!
Louie Louie in the house
Come on y'all, get some
I'm the designated hitter in the house
So don't play the hold out
Tell 'em what I'm talkin?about
Set it up - swingin?- strike 2!
Whole house swingin?
People screamin' - ears ringin?
With the sound that I'm throwin?down
Strike 3 - U're out!
Dropped it in the first round
CHORUS:
Hey, Louie Louie (Go, go, go, go, go, go Louie, go)
Aw yeah
Hey, Louie Louie (Go, go, go, go, go, go Louie, go)
Game 1 of a 7 games series
Who's up 2 bat? L-O-U-I-E
Now freeze, can everybody hear me?
Mic check - 1 2 3 - Ahem! Cool!
Now let me resume, make room
As I zoom 2 the charts with a hype tune
Step if U wanna with the squeeze play fly
But before U know it - another R.B.I.
Yeah
CHORUS
Time 2 switch - here comes a change-up
I'm kicking it at the park with an All-star line up
Comin?with the new gears
Sure 2 hit the kind of record these execs are sure 2 benefit from
Yo, hold up P, gimme some
Put some more kick in that bass drum - boom!
This version makes me wanna get dumb
U got me juiced and I'm lookin' 4 the home run
Yeah
Hey Louie Louis (Go, go, go, go, go, go Louie, go)
Who's in the house?
Hey Louie Louis (Go, go, go, go, go, go Louie, go)
Slide in with attention
I'm scoring a run, 4 which there is no prevention
Home field advantage don't mean a thing
As long as U bring your swing with soul and feeling
Dig down deep - reach a little farther
Come correct, or don't even bother
Sooner than later everybody will know my name
Louie Louie's headed 4 the Hall of Fame - yeah!
CHORUS
Yo ladies, what's the call?
Louie Louis's in the house with the party y'all (Oh!)
Oh! Rollin?up hard - this time flexin?
5-deep sitting in my Benz
4 those who diss and dismiss me
Try 2 write me off and say that I'm history
Before I even start, they said I'm through bookin?
Boy, I'm like Ball Park Franks - I'm plump when I'm cookin'
CHORUS
