<song artist="Prince" title="Deconstruction">
"One after the other, the Banished Ones fled
as they watched from the distance the destruction of the Digital Garden.
With no more fruit 2 bear from its trees, the haze was finally broken.
And with the rains came the awareness that never again
would anyone ever lay claim 2 the treasures of the Rainbow Children.
As though awakened from a dream, the muse opened her eyes.
This time as queen".
