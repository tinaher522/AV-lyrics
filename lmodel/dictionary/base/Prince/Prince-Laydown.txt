<song artist="Prince" title="Laydown">
Turn it up
You need to, you need to
You need to lay it down
You need to, you need to
You need to lay it down
You need to lay it down
And let me show you how
We do this thing
Up in funky town
From the heart of Minnesota
Here come the purple Yoda
Guaranteed to bring the dirty, new sound
Come on now
You need to, you need to lay it down
Come on now
You need to, you need to lay it down
I see ya
You need to shut it up
Your cup ain't full enough
Let me show you what I learned
From laying in the cut
You need a six string
And let that sucker ring
The holy funking roll
Let it get the people up
You need to lay it down
(Get up)
You need to
(Get up)
You need to lay it down
(Get up, lay down)
To say this name borders on blasphemy
Everybody wanna be me
If your girlfriend didn't have the surgery
Maybe she could see what I see
You need to, you need to
You need to lay it down
You need to lay it down
And let me show you how
We do this thing
Up in funky town
From the heart of Minnesota
Here come the purple Yoda
Guaranteed to bring the dirty new sound
Come on, now
Yours ain't really the grove we dance to
We need something more funky to move to
Y'all know what I'm talkin' 'bout
That purple bounce, bounce
Rio de Janeiro
Euro and Sud Amero
This dirty little groove for you
Let's do it now, come on, boo
Bounce, bounce
Come on now, come on now
Bounce, bounce
Come on now, come on now
Bounce, bounce
Come on now, come on now
Bounce, bounce
Come on now, come on now
You need to lay it down
And let me show you how
We do this thing
Up in funky town
From the heart of Minnesota
Here come the purple Yoda
Guaranteed to bring the dirty new sound
Let's go
