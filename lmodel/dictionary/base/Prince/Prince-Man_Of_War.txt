<song artist="Prince" title="Man_Of_War">
Why you screamin'?
You know I'm not a man of war
Break a gold chain that I gave you
Throw it down on the floor
Instead of this seven page letter
I wish I had peace of mind
My friends tell me, "You should go get her"
But lovin' you, lovin' you, lovin' you is a waste of time
Oh, yes it is, it's a waste of time, ooh
I need to get out of this city
I need to get you outta my head
I need to get away from the words that you said to me
(Why to screamin'?) Oh, baby
(you know I'm not a man of war)
How could you have think that I could put something inside of someone
That I put inside you, inside you?
Even if I tried to, if I tried to (Tried to, tried to)
I couldn't cause I still smell like that last time when we
I, but lovin' you, lovin' you, lovin' you's a waste of time (Is a waste of time)
Oh, yes it is
But lovin' you is a waste of time, baby
Oh
I need to feel wanted again
I need to feel love is alive, yeah
I need to hear you say that you ain't lookin' for another reason to make me cry
Why to screamin'? (Oh)
You know I'm not a man of war
I've been tryin' to make you happy, baby, ever since we were sophomores
But lovin' to, lovin' you, lovin' you's a waste of time
Oh, yes it is (Is a waste of time)
Ooh, it's a waste of time, waste of time, waste of time
If there is no future
Then there is no past
And all we've got is right now
Let us make it last, make it last, make it last, ooh
Why you screamin'?
You know I'm not a man of war
Break the gold chain that I gave you
Throw it down on the floor (Oh, throw it down)
Instead of this seven page letter
I wish I had peace of mind
My friends tell me, they tell me, "you should go get her"
But lovin' you, lovin' you, lovin' you's a waste of time
Oh, a waste of time, yeah
I need to get out of this city
I need to get you outta my head
I need to, I need to get away from the words that you said to me
I need to, hey, I need to feel wanted again, oh
I need to, huh, feel no sin
Hear me
(But lovin' you, lovin' you, lovin' you)
Why you screamin'?
You know I'm not a man of war
Break the gold chain that I gave you
Throw it down on the floor (Oh baby)
Instead of this seven page letter
I wish I had peace of mind
But my friends tell me, "you should go get her"
But lovin' you, lovin' you, lovin' you is a waste of time
You know I'm not a man'o'war
