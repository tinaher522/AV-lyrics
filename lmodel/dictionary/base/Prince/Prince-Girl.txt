<song artist="Prince" title="Girl">
Girl, U excite me so 
Ooh wee baby, your body's like no other 
Girl, it's U I gotta know 
Ooh wee baby, I bet U're quite a lover 
Ooh girl, I wanna take U home 
Ooh wee baby, U're dreaming I scream inside U 
I want U in the worst way 
U make me... 
Girl {x2} 
Girl, won't U kiss me? 
Ooh wee baby, my lips they want U so 
Girl, how can U resist me? 
The smell of animal lust is all, all over me 
Oh girl, if I could hold your hand 
I'd make U touch my body until U understand 
I'm your man all night, all day 
I want U in the worst way 
U make me... 
Caress the flower 
Warm, warm 
Bring it 2 the garden 
The garden? 
Be poetic 
Tell me what it feels like 
A sea of electricity? 
Now that's wonderful 
Talk 2 U? Talk 2 U? 
What do U wanna hear? 
If I was anything else I'd be the water in your bath, darling 
Mmm 
(Girl) Girl, U excite me so 
Ooh wee baby, my flesh is on fire 
(Girl) Girl, the way U play with it 
Ooh wee baby, I think U desire me 
Girl 
Make a wish, baby 
Anything 
We'll make it come true 
Me and U 
I want U in the worst way 
U make me... 
Ooh girl 
(Girl) {x2} 
U like the dreaming I scream... 
Girl, your lips are so wet (Girl) {fade out} 
Feel my hands, they're all sweaty
