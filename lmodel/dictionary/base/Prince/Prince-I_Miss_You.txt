<song artist="Prince" title="I_Miss_You">
(Acoustic Guitars)
I miss the ocean.
I miss the time we made love under the stars.
I miss the summer rain.
I miss those big ole' fancy cars.
I miss the blue sky.
I miss the pouring rain too
Most of all baby, I miss you.
I miss you, oh I miss you, oh I miss you.
(Acoustic Guitars)
