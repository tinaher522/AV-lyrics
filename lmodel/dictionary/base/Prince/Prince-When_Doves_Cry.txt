<song artist="Prince" title="When_Doves_Cry">
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Dig if you will the picture
Of you and I engaged in a kiss
The sweat of your body covers me
Can you, my darling, can you picture this?
Dream if you can a courtyard
An ocean of violets in bloom
Animals strike curious poses
They feel the heat, the heat between me and you
How can you just leave me standing
Alone in a world that's so cold? (So cold)
Maybe I'm just too demanding
Maybe I'm just like my father, too bold
Maybe you're just like my mother
She's never satisfied (She's never satisfied)
Why do we scream at each other?
This is what it sounds like when doves cry
Touch if you will my stomach
Feel how it trembles inside
You've got the butterflies all tied up
Don't make me chase you, even doves have pride
How could you just leave me standing
Alone in a world so cold? (World so cold)
Maybe I'm just too demanding
Maybe I'm just like my father, too bold
Maybe you're just like my mother
She's never satisfied (She's never satisfied)
Why do we scream at each other?
This is what it sounds like when doves cry
How can you just leave me standing
Alone in a world that's so cold? (World is so cold)
Maybe I'm just too demanding (Maybe, maybe)
Maybe I'm just like my father, too bold (I'm like my father, you know, you know he's too bold)
Maybe you're just like my mother (Maybe you're just like my mother)
She's never satisfied (Never, never satisfied)
Why do we scream at each other? (Why do we scream, why?)
This is what it sounds like when doves cry
When doves cry, when doves cry, when doves cry
When doves cry, when doves cry, when doves cry
