<song artist="Prince" title="Damn_U">
Damn U, U're so fine
Seems 2 happen 2 me each and every time we make love
I can't hold back
It's like having a hundred million little heart attacks
Damn U
Baby, U're so fine
Damn this kooky love affair
All I ever wanna do is play in your hair
2 people crazy in love
Into one another like a hand in a glove
Damn this kooky love affair
(Damn U)
Like animals just born 2 breed
Come 2 think about cha, baby, U're my only need
I'm on fire till U come and put me out
All I'm trying 2 say is that my psychedelic shouts
When U damn me
Damn U
When I'm in your arms it's all that I can do
When we're makin' love, I can't hold back
It's like having a hundred million little heart attacks
Damn U
Baby, U're so fine
Damn U
Baby, U're so fine
