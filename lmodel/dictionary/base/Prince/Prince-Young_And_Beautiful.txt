<song artist="Prince" title="Young_And_Beautiful">
So young and beautiful
So young and beautiful
You're so young and beautiful
You're so full of life - everybody knows
That's why they try to take advantage of you
But you don't have to do what the other ones do
You're so cool - the world at your feet
They only want your virginity
Keep your clothes on and your chastity
Until you find the one that's worth it baby
So young and beautiful
So young and beautiful
You're so fine my heart's just pounding
If I had the chance to lay you down
I'd probably take a rain check 'til next summer
'Cause I don't wanna be like all your other lovers
Young and beautiful
Young and beautiful
So young and beautiful
I'm hippin' you to the game darlin'
So that you'll always remain
Young and beautiful
Young and beautiful
Oh yeah
