Funny that U should call 
I was just sittin' by the telephone 
Lookin' 4 a remedy 
4 all my misery 
I'm sorry 4 what I said 
It's just that I didn't think our first date should be in bed 
Ooooh, I wanna let U be the one 
But U oughta know I'm lookin' 4 a boy that'll want me 4 more than one night of fun 
CHORUS: 
If I love U 2 night 
Promise me that U'll stay with me 'til the morning light 
(Baby, can U stay until the morning light?) 
Talk 2 me, tell me a story 
Just tell me U'll hold me tight (Hold me) 
If I love U 2 night 
I want U, this is true 
When U looked at me, I knew 
This ain't no matter of pride (No no) 
It's just that when tomorrow comes I want U here by my side 
CHORUS 
I'm lookin' 4 a boy, he don't have 2 be pure 
(I am looking 4 a boy) 
He just gotta be sho'nuff secure 
(Sho'nuff secure)
If U want a lover, I'm the remedy 
(I am the remedy, the remedy) 
But boy, U gotta tell me what U gonna do 4 me 
(What U gonna do, what U gonna do 4 me?) 
If I love U 2 night 
Promise me that U'll stay with me 'til the morning light 
(Say that U'll stay until the morning light) 
Talk 2 me, tell me a story 
Just tell me U'll hold me tight (Hold me, hold me) 
I'll make U breakfast, I'll drive U 2 work boy, I'll treat U right 
Promise me that U'll stay with me 'til the morning light 
If I love U 2 night (If I love U 2 night) 
Oh yeah, baby 
I wanna give U my love 
But U gotta promise me (If I love U 2 night) 
That U'll love me 4 ever 
Uh, yeah baby (If I love U 2 night) 
Uh, just like that, yeah 
Ah, yeah 
Right there
