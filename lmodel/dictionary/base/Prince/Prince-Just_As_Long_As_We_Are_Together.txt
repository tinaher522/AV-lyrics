<song artist="Prince" title="Just_As_Long_As_We_Are_Together">
U can live your own life and I'll live mineI will never try 2 keep U downEven if I only see U some of the timeI'm just happy when U come aroundEven if the sun don't shineI'm warm enough when U're in these arms of mine
CHORUS:Just as long as we're 2getherEverything's alright (Everything's alright)Everything's alright (Everything's alright)
There is nothin' that will overcome the love we shareNothin' that will break us apartGirl, I got 2 always have U in my hairGotta always have U in my heartOoh baby, your place or mineI'll get the music baby, U bring the wine
Just as long as we're 2getherOh girl, there ain't nothin' better (Just as long as we're 2gether)
CHORUS
Just as long as there is UI'll be around doing what U want me 2Just as long as there is meI'll be around singin' your melody, sugar
Just as long as we're 2gether (Everything's alright)Oh baby, everything's alrightJust as long as we're 2gether (Everything's alright)Oh girl, everything's alrightJust as long as we're 2gether (Everything's alright)Oh girl, everything's alrightDon't U know there ain't nothin' better (Everything's alright)I really want U baby in my life, U know
