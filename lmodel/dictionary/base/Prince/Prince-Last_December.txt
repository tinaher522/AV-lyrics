<song artist="Prince" title="Last_December">
If your last December came
What would U do?
Would anybody remember
2 remember U?
Did U stand tall?
Or did U fall?
Did U give your all?
Did U ever find a reason
Why U had 2 die?
Or did U just plan on leaving
Without wondering why?
Was it everything it seemed?
Or did it feel like a dream?
Did U feel redeemed?
CHORUS:
Ahh ahh ahh, in the name of the Father
In the name of the Son
Ahh ahh ahh, we need 2 come 2gether
Come 2gether as one
Did U love somebody
But got no love in return?
Or did U understand the real meaning of love?
That it just is and never yearns?
When the truth arrives
Will U be lost on the other side?
Will U still be alive?
CHORUS
(Yeah)
(Father)
((Where are U?))
(They've lost... they've lost U)
((This world)) {looped}
In your life did U just give a little
Or did U give all that U had?
Were U just somewhere in the middle? (Somewhere in the middle)
Not 2 good, not 2 bad?
CHORUS {x2}
One, one
CHORUS
One {looped}
