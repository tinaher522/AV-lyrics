Hot thing!
Hot thing - barely 21
Hot thing - lookin' for big fun
Hot thing - what's your fantasy?
Hot thing - do you wanna play with me?
Hot thing - baby, you dance so good
Hot thing - baby, I knew you would
Hot thing - tell me what you see
Hot thing - when you smile, when you smile, when you smile
Are your smiles, are your smiles for me?
Hot thing - maybe you should give your folks a call
Hot thing - tell 'em you're goin' to the crystal ball
Hot thing - tell 'em you're comin' home late if you're comin' home at all
Hot thing - you can tell 'em you found a brand new baby doll
Hot thing - I can't... I can't wait to get you home
Hot thing - where we can be alone
Hot thing - I could read you poetry
And then we could...we could make a story of our own
(We could make a story of our own)
Hot thing!
Hot, hot, hot thing!
Hot thing, hot thing
Hot thing, hot thing
Hot thing - barely 21
Hot thing - lookin' for big fun
Hot thing - what's your fantasy?
Hot thing - don't you wanna play with me?
Hot thing!
Hot thing!
Hot thing - I can't wait to get you home
Hot thing
