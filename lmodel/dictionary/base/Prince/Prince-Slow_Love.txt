<song artist="Prince" title="Slow_Love">
Young is the night
It feels so right
Now that U're mine
Let's take our time
The man in the moon is smiling
4 he knows what I'm dreaming of
2night is the night 4 making slow love
The gentle breeze
It blows with ease
Let's make it slow
Just like the wind blows
Let's make it last 4ever
4 a hundred times wouldn't be enough
2night is the night 4 making slow love
CHORUS:
Slow love
So much better when we take it easy
Slow love
It's so much better when we take our time
Love's in your eyes (In your eyes)
Eyes never lie
Don't rush the feelin'
U got me reelin'
U can see through race car drivers
Let me show U what I'm made of
2night is the night 4 making slow love
CHORUS {repeat 2 fade}
