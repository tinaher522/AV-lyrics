<song artist="Prince" title="Sexy_Motherfucker">
In a word or two, you I wanna do
No, not your body, your mind, you fool
Come here baby, yeah
You sexy mother fucker
We're all alone in a villa on the Rivera
That's in France on the south side
In case you cared, out of all your friends
I wanna be the closest, that's why I tell you things
So you'll be the moistest
When it comes to life, this man's wife
You got to be well educated on the subject of fights
I mean prevention of
In other words
It's R E A L meaning Of this thing called love
Are you up on this?
If so, then you can get up off hug and a kiss
Come here baby, yeah
You sexy mother fucker
Come here baby, yeah
You sexy mother fucker
We need to talk about things
Tell me what you do, tell me what you eat
I might cook for you
See it really don't matter, 'cuz it's all about me and you
Ain't no one else around
I'm even with the blindfold, gagged and bound
I don't mind, see this ain't about sex
It's all about love being in charge of this life
And the next
Why all the cosmic talk?
I just want you smarter than I'll ever be
When we take that walk
Come here baby, yeah
You sexy mother fucker
Come here baby, yeah
You sexy mother fucker
Horns, stand please
I like it, I like it
You seem perplexed I haven't taken you yet
Can't you see I'm harder than a man can get
I got wet dreams
Comin' out of my ears
I get hard if the wind blows your cologne near me
But I can take it
'Cuz I want the whole nine
This ain't about the body, it's about the mind
Come here baby, yeah
You sexy mother fucker
Come here baby, yeah
You sexy mother fucker
Tommy Barbarella in the house
Scrub the dishes
Come here Tommy, yeah
Sexy, sexy, sexy, sexy
Levi, Levi, fly
(Oh man, let's give 'em some more good shit)
I like it, I like it
Sexy mother fucker shakin' that ass
Shakin' that ass, shakin' that ass
Sexy mother fucker shakin' that ass
Shakin' that ass, shakin' that ass
Guard your folks and get your daughter
The sexy motherfucker's so fine I could drink her bathwater
A long, leggy 5'8", packing an ass as tight as a grape
I want to spit some game but I said to myself
Hmm, just conversate
'Cuz I'm usually quite the calm one
You never found me out prowling boy
I'm just havin' fun
But I'm happy to change my state of mind for this behind
I bet that if you threw that ass into the air it would turn into sunshine
Sexy mother fucker shakin' that ass
Shakin' that ass, shakin' that ass
Sexy mother fucker shakin' that ass
Shakin' that ass, shakin' that ass
Sexy mother fucker shakin' that ass
Shakin' that ass, shakin' that ass, ooh
Sexy mother fucker shakin' that ass
Shakin' that ass, shakin' that ass
You sexy mother fucker
Sexy mother fucker
Sexy mother fucker
Sexy mother fucker
Sexy mother fucker
Sexy mother fucker
Sexy mother fucker
Sexy mother fucker
Sexy mother fucker
You sexy mother fucker
Sexy mother fucker
Sexy mother fucker
Sexy mother fucker
