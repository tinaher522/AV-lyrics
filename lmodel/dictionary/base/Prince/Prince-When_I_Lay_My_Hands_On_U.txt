<song artist="Prince" title="When_I_Lay_My_Hands_On_U">
Message U're about 2 hear is not meant 4 transmission
Should only be accessed in the privacy of your mind
Words are intense so my dear, if U dare 2 listen
Take off your clothes, meet me between the lines
CHORUS:
Are U ready 4 the touch that makes U go insane
From breast 2 lips 2 cheek 2 mane
I'll pull your hair, U will feel no pain
Are U ready 4 the only 4ever we'll both obtain
The only joy in this forsaken game
U'll feel ashamed and ordained
When I lay my hands on U
The touch U're about 2 feel is the one U've been wishin' 4
It's been here like an echo inside your space and time
It's about 2 get freaky cuz the places that I'll be kissin'
Are the places that no other man could ever find
Oh whiney, get ready 4 the touch that makes U go insane
From breast 2 lips 2 cheek 2 mane
I pull your hair, U will feel no pain (Baby, baby)
Are U ready 4 the only 4ever we'll both obtain
The only joy in this forsaken game (God forbid)
U'll feel ashamed and ordained (God forbid)
When I lay my hands on U
Ha ha ha
Nobody knows
Like I knows
Where the deepest part of your river flows
Snap, snap
Unto these nylon hose
Around your thighs my finger goes slowly
Like a cat tip-toes
Until I reach the cap stone
I will touch thee in the softest manner
Like Europa in the hands of Santana
CHORUS
When I lay my hands on U
