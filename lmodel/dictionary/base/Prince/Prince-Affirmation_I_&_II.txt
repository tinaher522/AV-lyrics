<song artist="Prince" title="Affirmation_I_&_II">
Before you have any interaction
With members of the opposite sex
We're going to have to debrief you thoroughly
Over the course of the next few sessions
Today though we'll just start off with some simple affirmations
That will be automatically induced into your memory temple
Which you can upload onto a hard drive
And review at your desire
Affirmation number I:
There are no such words as "me" or "mine"
Words of this nature were introduced into society
As a control mechanism
Which systematically divided the subjects first individually
And then as a collective
From now on
Any person or object whatsoever that requires your attention
Is something that has veered from its path and preordained destiny
Of total enlightenment
