<song artist="Prince" title="Dear_Mr._Man">
What's wrong with the world 2day? 
Things just got 2 get better
Show me what the leaders say 
Maybe we should write a letter
Said Dear Mr. Man
We don't understand 
Why poor people keep struggling
But U don't lend a helping hand
Matthew 5:5 say
"The meek shall inherit the earth" 
We wanna b down that way
But U been trippin' since the day of your birth 
Who said that
2 kill is a sin 
Then started every single war
That Ur people been in?
Who said that water
Is a precious commodity 
Then dropped a big old black oil slick
In the deep blue sea? 
Who told me, Mr. Man
That working round the clock 
Would buy me a big housed in the hood
Cigarette ads on every block
Who told me, Mr. Man
That Eye got a right 2 moan?
How about this big old hole
In the ozone?
What's wrong with the world 2day
Things just got 2 get better
Dear Mr. Man, we don't understand
Maybe we should write a letter
Listen, ain't no sense in voting
Same song with a different name
Might not b in the back of the bus
But it sure feel just the same
Ain't nothing fair about welfare
Ain't no assistance in AIDS
We ain't that affirmative about your actions
Until the people get paid
Ur thousand years r up
Now U got 2 share the land
Section 1 - the 14th amendment says
"No state shall deprive any person of life, 
liberty, or property, without due process of law"
Mr. Man, we want 2 end this letter with 3 words
We tired a-y'all
Tired, tired
Tired
Dear Mr. Man
Hey
What's wrong with the world 2day
Things just got 2 get better
