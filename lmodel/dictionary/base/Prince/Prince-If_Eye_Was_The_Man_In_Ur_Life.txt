<song artist="Prince" title="If_Eye_Was_The_Man_In_Ur_Life">
If I was the man in ur life
I'd make U happy, I'd treat U right
I'd buy U flowers every single day
I'd give U power, I'd do whatever U say
I heard a rumor that ur man they said he do you wrong 
And u're so vain you think that u're the one behind this song 
You know he got plenty lyrics, yeah, up his sleeve 
And after he got what he want he just gon' up and leave
Sunday chocolate on the roof right after his game
He like the Lakers but the Sixers on when he came
If he's with another now U best believe the party's crackin'
U getting played girl and U better get your mack on
And do un2 others 
As they do un2 U 
And call me on the day 
That U and him are just 2 thru
If I was the man in ur life
I'd make U happy, I'd treat U right
I'd buy U flowers every single day
I'd give U power, I'd do whatever U say
Was that U I saw outside the liquor store
Waiting on that fool to purchase what U been dying for?
Never thought I would see a drop of spirit ever bring U down 
Now U got that triflin' barracuda hangin' 'round
Hangin' 'round ur neck like a cheap gold chain
He don't deserve to say that he ever knew Ur name
Much less he get to smell the perfume I gave ya
Please don't tell me that you all got down
Better do un2 others
As they do un2 U
And call me on the day
That U and him are just 2 thru
If I was the man in ur life
I'd make U happy, I'd treat U right
I'd buy U flowers every single day
I'd give U power, I'd do whatever U say
Say whatever u say
