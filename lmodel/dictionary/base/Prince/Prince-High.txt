<song artist="Prince" title="High">
I'll get you high yeah
Prince gonna get you high
CHORUS:
I'll get you high yeah
I'll get you high
I'll get you high yeah
Prince gonna get you high
Ooh (Uh!)
Making your way through the neighborhood
Looking for some good boys, toys
Bobbin' your tail 2 another one of Prince's jams
Trying to look real coy
when they pull up right beside you
and ask if they can ride you
(Check, where the party at?)
The horn goes beep
The music in the jeep goes
I got the music to get you high again
I got the beat that make you act like a hooligan
I got the rhyme, make you tell a friend
Prince gonna get you high
CHORUS
Every now and then, you're havin' one of them days
People gettin' on your last nerve, ooh
No matter how you cut it, nothing seems to go your way
You wanna quit this job
Get your swerve on, turn the radio up
It's a new day, the only way to see it is your way
The door goes slam
Now you sing this jam (Go)
I got the music to get you high again
Got the beat that make U act like a hooligan
Got the rhyme, make you tell a friend
Prince gonna get you high
NPG ahdio getting you high again
CHORUS
