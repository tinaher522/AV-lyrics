<song artist="Prince" title="Life_Can_Be_So_Nice">
This morning there was joy in my heart 4 I know that I love U so
Scrambled eggs are so boring 4 U're all, all that I wanna know
Kisses never lie when delivered with milk from your lips
Morning glories (never) cry, my love 4 U, baby, drips
Oh, life can be so nice
It's a wonderful world, sweet paradise
Kiss me once, kiss me twice
Life can be so nice, so nice
Life can be so nice
No one plays the clarinet the way U play my heart
I come a thousand different ways before I even start
U're so nice
Shivering madly in your embrace is better than a trip
(Shivering madly in your embrace)
Morning glories never cry, my love is just a-drippin'
(Better than a trip)
Scrambled eggs are boring, mama, U're all I wanna know
(Morning glorified in every way)
This morning there was joy in my heart cuz I know that I love U so, shit!
(My love 4 U, baby, drips)
So nice
(I know, yes sir!)
Life can be so nice
It's a wonderful world, paradise (So nice)
Kiss me once, kiss me twice
Life can be so nice (Life can be so nice)
Life can be so nice
It's a wonderful world, paradise
Kiss me once, kiss me twice (Drip)
Life can be so nice, so nice
So nice
