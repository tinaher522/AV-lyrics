<song artist="Prince" title="Hold_Me">
I've tried so many times 2 erase your memory from my mind
Yet, it doesn't ever last 4 long
I see your picture then I hear your voice
Our love must be stronger than before
Every time I see your eyes (Touch me)
Touch me (Hold me)
Every time I hear your voice (Touch me)
Hold me
Here I stand defenseless as I look into your eyes
There's nothing left 2 say or do
U fill my head with promises and all your pretty lies
Would it be so wrong 2 want U by my side?
Every time I see your eyes (Touch me)
Touch me (Hold me)
Every time I hear your voice (Touch me)
Touch me (Hold me)
I'm captured by my senses, lost in your reverie
Our love must be stronger than before
Every time I see your eyes (Touch me)
Oh, hold me, babe (Hold me)
Every time I hear your voice (Touch me)
Touch me (Hold me)
Every time I see your eyes (Touch me)
I wanna hold U, baby (Hold me)
(Hold me, touch me, kiss me all over)
Every time I hear your voice (Touch me)
Hold me, kiss me all over (Hold me)
Every time I see your eyes (Touch me)
Kiss me, baby (Hold me)
