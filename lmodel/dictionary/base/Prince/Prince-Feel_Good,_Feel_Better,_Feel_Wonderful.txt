<song artist="Prince" title="Feel_Good,_Feel_Better,_Feel_Wonderful">
Feel better, feel good, feel wonderful
Feel better, feel good, feel wonderful
Hey!
I could tell by the color of your energy field
You thought this game was over
Chemical peel
You tried to do me like my good brother Steve
But I got another funky
Trick up my sleeve
Expecting me to freak on you a little bit more
But you get nothin' but well-wishes and flowers galore
I mean no harm
I still got your back
You can come and drink my wine
As a matter of fact
Just feel better, feel good, feel wonderful
I don't know what you thought
When you spit in my face
But this dimension ain't the time
Or the place
I don't know who told you you could
Stand next to me
'Cause I got a guitar that could
Part the sea
Don't mean no disrespect
I ain't tryin' to brag
But that might be the same one that
Tapped on the crag
And brought forth the water
That quenched your thirst
And we'll keep feeding ya
But first things first!
Feel better, feel good, feel wonderful
If you think about how much time it took
For you to try to get a page in my book
I feel so good right now
I just can't recall
What the-
I was thinking when I
Threw you the ball
It hit three bystanders after you touched it
Now they wanna sue me but they love me to much
'Cause they know I wish them heaven and all of its gold
Same to you, come on let's groove
To the purple rock 'n roll
Feel better, feel good, feel wonderful
Better than good, better than good,
You know you should feel wonderful
Keep your mind in the vertical motion
Always looking up
