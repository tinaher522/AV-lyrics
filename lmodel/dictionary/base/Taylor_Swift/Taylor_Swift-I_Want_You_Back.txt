<song artist="Taylor_Swift" title="I_Want_You_Back">
Oh baby give me one more chance
(I'll show you that I love you)
I want you please let me,
Back in your heart
Oh darling I was blind to let you go
(Let you go baby)
Now that I see you in her arms
I want you back
I want you back
I want you back
I want you back, ohh baby
I want you back
I want you back
I want you back
Ohh woah-oh
Oh baby give me one more chance
(I'll show you that I love you)
I want you please let me,
Back in your heart
Oh darling I was blind to let you go
(Let you go baby)
Now that I see you in her arms
