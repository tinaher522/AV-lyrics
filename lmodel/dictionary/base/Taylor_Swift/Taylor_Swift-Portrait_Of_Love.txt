Cheri Dennis
J-O-C
I Luv U Cheri
Mama Mi amor I adore
Let Joc give you the world and more
Purchase the blue's it you's of course
Or we could vacate somewhere off shore
Or we could stay home tonite
Tops and pop we gonna get it right
Dim them lights be my snack in the middle of the night aight
See you at the corner
Corner of my eye
When you walking by
I get an appetite
Wanna take your picture
Wont u strike a pose
Turning them to up
Just wanna let u know
I think you're sexy
Baby wont u let me
Paint the prerfect picture of us
Its so electric (yeahhi)
Something classic
Make it everlasin'
Its gonna be incredible
Priceless
It cant be sold
Come and see the Portrait of Love (love, love, love)
This ain't the Mona Lisa
No Michaelangelo Picture
Come and see the Portrait of Love (love, love, love)
This aint no history sculpture
Just a love getting closer (Yeahhh)
No need to be scared
It's not unusual to want somebody
More than physically
Ohh noo
U gotta play it fare
I promise that I'll be the only one
To blow your mind and get you there
I think you're sexy
Baby won't u let me
Paint the prerfect picture of us
It's so electric (yeahhi)
Something classic
Make it everlastin'
It's gonna be incredible
Priceless
It can't be sold
Come and see the Portrait of Love (love, love, love)
This ain't the Mona Lisa
No Michaelangelo Picture
Come and see the Portrait of Love
This ain't no history sculpture
Just a love getting closer (Yeahhh)
Come and see the Portrait of Love (love, love, love)
This ain't the Mona Lisa
No Michaelangelo Picture
Come and see the Portrait of Love
This ain't no history sculpture
Just a love getting closer (Yeahhh)
The color of love
Is it red?
Or is it blue?
The creation of love
Beatiful and simply true (U U Uuu)
Aight time 2 go
Wit a young O.G baby dat be Zoe
U ain't gotta tell what ya man don't kno
Lookin at me baby wit ya eyes on gold
Spittin no game I can see u chose
A young lil playa
Chevrolet on 4's
Came by lost Cheri we both know
So we'll have a couple of drinks and some good convo
Yea
Come and see the Portrait of Love (love, love
This ain't the Mona Lisa
No Michaelangelo Picture
Come and see the Portrait of Love
This ain't no history sculpture
Just a love getting closer
No need to be scared
It's not unusual to want somebody
More than physically
Ohh noo
U gotta play fair
Oooh so there
