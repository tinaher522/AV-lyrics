<song artist="Taylor_Swift" title="The_Best_Day">
I'm five years old 
Its getting cold out, got my big coat on 
I hear your laugh and look up smiling at you 
I run and run, past the pumpkin patch, and the tractor rides 
Look now, the sky is gold 
I hug your legs and fall asleep on the way home 
I dont know why all the trees change in the fall 
I know youre not scared of anything at all 
Dont know if Snow Whites house is near or far away 
But I know I had the best day with you today 
I'm thirteen now 
And dont know how my friends could be so mean 
I come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys 
And we drive and drive until we found a town far enough away 
And we talk and window shop til I forgot all their names 
I dont know who I'm gonna talk to now at school 
But I know I'm laughing on the car ride home with you 
Dont know how long its gonna take to feel ok 
But I know I had the best day with you today 
I have an excellent father 
His strength is making me stronger 
God smiles on my little brother 
Inside and out hes better than I am 
I grew up in a pretty house 
And I had space to run 
And I had the best days with you 
There is a video I found from back when I was three 
You set up a paint set in the kitchen and youre talking to me 
Its the age of princesses and pirate ships and the seven dwarfs 
And daddys smart and youre the prettiest lady in the whole wide world 
Now I know why all the trees change in the fall 
I know you were on my side even when I was wrong 
And I love you for giving me your eyes 
Staying back and watching me shine 
And I didnt know if you knew so I'm taking this chance to say 
That I had the best day with you today
