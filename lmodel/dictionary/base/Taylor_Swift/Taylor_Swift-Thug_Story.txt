[T-Pain]
Hey, Hey
T-Swizzle, T-Pizzle
[Taylor Swift]
I'm like 8 foot 4, blond hair to the floor
You shorties never thought I dreamed about rapping hardcore
No I ain't got a gun
No I never really been in a club
Still live with my parents
But I'm still a thug
I'm so gangsta you can find me baking cookies at night
You out clubbing, but I just made caramel delight
[T-Pain]
(MMMMM MMMMM Good)
[Taylor Swift]
T-Swift and T-Pain rappin on the same track
It's a thug story tell me can you handle that
[Both]
I had a dream last night
[Taylor Swift]
I had high-top Nikes
I had
[Both]
Diamonds in my mouth, and diamonds on my mic
[Taylor Swift]
By the time I woke up I was singing
[T-Pain]
"I'M ON A BOAT"
[Taylor Swift]
Cause I'm a singer turned rapper
[T-Pain]
Shorty imma make ya
[Taylor Swift]
Straight to the top, yo
[T-Pain]
Shorty imma take ya
[Taylor Swift]
You can call me T-Sweezy now I'm a rap star
[T-Pain]
Hey, it's a thug story now tell them who you are
Singer turned gangsta
[Taylor Swift]
You don't wanna fight me
[T-Pain]
Straight to the top
[Taylor Swift]
In my extra small white tee
[T-Pain]
T-Swift and T-Pain all up on the same track
It's a thug story tell me now can you get with that
[Taylor Swift]
What! What! I knit sweaters yo!
[T-Pain]
Oh, oh
[Taylor Swift]
What! What! Don't test me [bleep]
[Taylor Swift]
Hey hold on, hold on I didn't even say anything
[T-Pain]
WHAT?
[Taylor Swift]
I said "Yo"
[T-Pain]
YO
[Taylor Swift]
You guys bleeped me and I didn't even say anything
I didn't even swear
[T-Pain]
SHE DIDN'T EVEN SWEAR
[Taylor Swift]
Hello??
