<song artist="Taylor_Swift" title="Place_In_This_World">
I don't know what I want
So don't ask me 'cause I'm still trying to figure it out
Don't know what's down this road
I'm just walking, trying to see through the rain coming down
Even though I'm not the only one who feels the way I do
I'm alone, on my own and I'm starting off
I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh, but life goes on
Oh, I'm just a girl trying to find a place in this world
Got the radio on, my old blue jeans
And I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve
Feeling lucky today, got the sunshine
Can you tell me what more do I need
And tomorrow's just a mystery, oh, yeah, but that's okay
I'm alone, on my own and I'm starting off
I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh, but life goes on
Oh, I'm just a girl trying to find a place in this world
Maybe I'm just a girl on a mission but I'm ready to fly
I'm alone, on my own and I'm starting off
Oh, I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh, but life goes on
Oh, I'm alone, on my own and I'm starting off
Oh, I'm just a girl trying to find a place in this world
Oh, I'm just a girl
Oh, I'm just a girl
Oh, I'm just a girl
