<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="Fly_Me_To_The_Moon">
Fly me to the moon, let me play among the stars
Let me see what spring is like on Jupiter and Mars.
In other words, hold my hand
In other words, darling, kiss me.
Fill my heart with song and let me sing for ever more
You are all I long for, all I worship and adore.
In other words, please, be true
In other words, I love you.
In other words, hold my hand
In other words, darling, kiss me.
Fill my life with song and let me sing for ever more
You are all I long for, all I worship and adore.
In other words, please, please, be true
In other words, I love you.
