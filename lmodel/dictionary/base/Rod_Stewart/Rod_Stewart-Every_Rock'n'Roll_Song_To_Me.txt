<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="Every_Rock'n'Roll_Song_To_Me">
Hey, you're my “Strawberry Fields”
I know that's strange but it's how I feel
And hey, be my “Heart of Glass”
And I will always make you laugh
You're my “Bridge over Troubled Water”
And there ain't a thing about you I would alter
You're every rock’n’roll song to me
Hey, “Bette Davis Eyes”
Now roll me like a “Tumbling Dice”
And hey, you're my “Billie Jean”,
My “Peggy Sue” and “Layla” too
You're my “Bohemian Rhapsody”
I'm crazy bout ya, can't you see?
You're every rock’n’roll song to me
Ah, yeah!
And hey, be my “Blonde on Blonde”
And “Bring It On Home” where you belong
And hey, you're my “Rock of Ages”,
“You Sexy Thing”, you're so outrageous
You're my unscratched “Tubular Bells”,
My very own “Bat Out of Hell”
You're every rock’n’roll song to me
You're every rock’n’roll song to me
Now what I'm saying to you may seem quite absurd
But it's from the heart baby,
So please, please don't analyse the words
Ah, yeah!
You're my vinyl “Yellow Brick Road”
And on you, baby I am sold!
You're every rock’n’roll song to me
One more time!
And hey, be my “Uptown Girl”,
I just wanna share your world
And hey, “In the Midnight Hour”
I will always “Bring You Flowers”
You're my “Dark Side of the Moon”
Your pretty face lights up every room
You're every rock’n’roll song to me
You're every rock’n’roll song to me
Ahhhh, yeah!
You're every rock’n’roll song to me.
