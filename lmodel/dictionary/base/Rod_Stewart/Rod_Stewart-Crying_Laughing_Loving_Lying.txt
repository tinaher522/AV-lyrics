<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="Crying_Laughing_Loving_Lying">
Crying, 
Crying never did nobody no good 
No how, no how  
Thats why I, 
I don't cry 
Thats why I, 
I don't cry 
Laughing, 
Laughing sometimes does 
Somebody some good 
Somehow, somehow 
Thats why I 
I'm laughing now  
Thats why I 
I'm laughing now 
Loving, 
Loving never did me no good 
No how, no how 
Thats why I 
Can love you now 
Thats why I 
Can love you now
Lying, 
Lying never did nobody no good 
No how, no how 
So why am I 
Lying now 
So why am I 
Lying now
