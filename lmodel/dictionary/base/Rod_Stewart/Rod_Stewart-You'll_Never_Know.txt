<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="You'll_Never_Know">
You'll never know just how much I miss you
You'll never know just how much I care
And if I tried, I still couldn't hide my love for you
You ought to know, for haven't I told you so
A million or more times?
You went away and my heart went with you
I speak your name in my every prayer
and if there is some other way to prove that I love you
I swear I don't know how
You'll never know if you don't know now
And if I tried, I still couldn't hide my love for you
You ought to know, for haven't I told you so
One million or more times?
You went away and my heart went with you
I speak your name in my every prayer
and if there is some other way to prove that I love you
I swear I don't, I don't know how
You'll never know if you don't know now
Ooh, ooh, ooh
If you don't know now
Ooh, ooh, ooh
You'll never, ever know
If you don't know now
