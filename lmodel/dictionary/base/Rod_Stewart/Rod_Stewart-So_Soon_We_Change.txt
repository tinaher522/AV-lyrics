<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="So_Soon_We_Change">
Seems like only yesterday
We were laughing like a couple of kids
Fun we had when first met
Ain't been around much since
Sharing every hour every day
Funny how time slips away
But there's no replacement, baby
When the good times fade away
Oh how soon we changed
Oh how soon we changed
Funny how soon we change
Oh how soon we changed
You remember Casey's bar
and Maxfields after dark
We were different people then
Inseparable never apart
But now the novelty is wearing thin
We spend most time arguing
It was all so easy then
It'll never be again
Oh how soon we changed
Oh how soon we changed
Oh how soon we changed
Oh how soon we changed
I thought I knew you inside out
But obviously I was wrong
Makes no difference what I say
We just don't get along
Face the facts it can never last
We're driffing apart real fast
I'd gladly give up everything
to start all over again
Oh how soon we changed
Oh how soon we changed
Funny how soon we changed
Oh how soon we changed
Oh how soon we changed
Funny how soon we changed
Oh how soon we changed
Oh how soon we changed
