<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="Batman_Superman_Spiderman">
Come on, little soldier, you look so tired
You nearly fell out of that chair
Turn down the television, pick up your toys
And I'll race you to the top of the stairs
Cuddle out close and I'll turn out the light
And we'll look for the man in the moon
I'll tell you a story about Gotham City
If you promise not to grow up too soon
It's time for bed, my little boy
Lay down your head
And I'll be here when you wake up
With Woody and Buzz and a great big hug
I'll be here when you wake up
With your shoes and socks and a house full of love
Batman, Superman, Spiderman
Oh yeah
Batman, Superman, Spiderman
My daddy told me stories when I was a boy
About castles, kings and knights
Bonny Prince Charlie and football teams
And ships that disappear in the night
It's time for bed, my little son
Lay down your head
And I'll be here when you wake up
With Woody and Buzz and a great big hug
I'll be here when you wake up
With your shoes and socks and a loving cup
You are my life, yeah
You are my life
Now you're sleeping and the house is quiet
We got a lifetime to share
And I'm gonna be the best dad I can be
And I ain't going nowhere, nowhere
Batman, Superman, Spiderman
Batman, Superman, Spiderman
I know you're missing your mama tonight
You're the sunshine in her day
But sometimes, things don't work out in life
Grown-ups are funny that way
Oh, lay down your head, my beautiful boy
Lay down your head
And I'll be here when you wake up
With Woody and Buzz and a great big hug
I'll be here when you wake up
With your shoes and socks and a great big hug
I'll be here
Now, don't be afraid
Batman, Superman, Spiderman
Batman, Superman, Spiderman
