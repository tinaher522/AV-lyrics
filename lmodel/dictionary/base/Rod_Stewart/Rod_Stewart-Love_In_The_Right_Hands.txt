<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="Love_In_The_Right_Hands">
Been hurt before, lost many wars
And you realize the danger you're in
You given your heart to make a new start
You're taking a chance you'll get hurt again
Don't be afraid, it don't have to be that way
Remember, that, love, love in the right hands
Is like sunlight burning through in the morning sky
I said, love, love in the right hands
Is such a powerful thing so put your hands in mine
I'll be there for you, I'll help you get through
When the pressures of this will surround you
You know it will rain but (	    ) from the pain
You'll find shelter in my arms around you
But don't be afraid, you gotta have faith in me
Remember, I said, love, love in the right hands
Is like sunlight burning through in the morning sky
I said, love, love in the right hands
Is such a powerful thing so put your hands in mine
And I will always try
I promise you I'll never let you down
Will ever make you cry inside my heart
We'll always be together, I'll be true to you forever
All of my live
And I will always try
I promise you I'll never let you down
Will ever make you cry inside my heart
We'll always be together, I'll be true to you forever
All of my live
Love in the right hands
Like sunlight burning through in the morning sky
I said, love, love in the right hands
Such a powerful thing so put your hands in mine
Love, love in the right hands
Like sunlight burning through in the morning sky
I said, love, love in the right hands
Is such a powerful thing so put your hands in mine
