<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="(Your_Love_Keeps_Lifting_Me)_Higher_And_Higher">
Your love, lifting me higher 
Than I've ever been lifted before 
So keep it up, quench my desire 
And I'll be at your side forevermore 
You know your love (your love keeps lifting me) 
Keeps on lifting (your love keeps lifting me) 
Higher (lifting me, lifting me), higher, and higher (higher) 
I said your love (your love keeps lifting me) 
Keeps on (lifting me, lifting me) 
Lifting me (lifting me) higher and higher (higher) 
Now once I was downhearted 
Disappointment was my closest friend 
But then you came and he soon departed 
And you know he never showed his face again 
That's why your love (your love keeps lifting me) 
Keeps on lifting (your love keeps lifting me) 
Higher (lifting me, lifting me), higher, and higher (higher) 
I said your love (your love keeps lifting me) 
Keeps on (lifting me, lifting me) 
Lifting me (lifting me) higher and higher (higher) 
Awww 
I'm so glad I finally found you 
Yes, that one in a million girls 
And I wish my loving arms around ya 
Honey, I can stand up and face the world 
Let me tell ya your love (your love keeps lifting me) 
Keeps on lifting (your love keeps lifting me) 
Higher (lifting me, lifting me) higher, and higher (higher) 
I said your love (your love keeps lifting me) 
Keeps on (lifting me, lifting me) 
Lifting me (lifting me) higher and higher (higher) 
(Various scat singing to end)
