<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="I_Could_Feel_The_Whole_World_Turn_Around_Underneath_Me">
When I first saw you this strange kind of feeling set my head a-reeling 
Like I hit the ceiling. 
The same thing happened to me then, baby. 
Something kind of crazy and everything went hazy. 
 
Lightning and thunder shook the ground. 
And I could feet the whole world turn round underneath me. 
I could feet the whole world turn round. 
My, have you never been set on fire? 
Burning with desire growing higher and higher. 
Like on a funny fair big wheel stopping when you are to topping, 
Then you feel it dropping
Rising and heaven falling down. 
And I could feet the whole world turn round underneath me. 
I could feet the whole world turn round. 
I took my breath as though I've been running. 
Quite completely stunning, Holy, overcoming. 
And in a funny way it seemed frightening. 
Tension and a hardening
Thunder and the lightning
And I've grown the singer who wrote that song. 
And I could feet the whole world turn round underneath me. 
I could feet the whole world turn round when you're near me. 
I could feet the whole world turn round. 
I could feet the whole world turn round underneath me. 
I could feet the whole world turn round when you're near me. 
I could feet the whole world turn round.
