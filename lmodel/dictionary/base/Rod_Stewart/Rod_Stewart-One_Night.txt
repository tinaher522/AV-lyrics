<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="One_Night">
Call me a fool
Send me away
I've got to say
It's you I adore
Alone and in love
Falling apart
I followed my heart
Straight to your door
Face to face
With all honesty
I would be greatful
If you'd give to me
One night, to lay in your arms
One night, could it be that I was born
To make every dream you never had come true
Oh oh oh oh
One night, just one night with you
Call me baby
Standing this close
The sound of your voice
Leaves me no choice
Am I so worng
To think (		   )
'cause baby you're all
You're all I'm thinking of
Face to face
With all honesty
I would be greatful
If you'd give to me
One night, to lay in your arms
One night, could it be that I was born
To make every dream you've ever had come true
Oh oh oh oh
One night, just one night with you
One night, to lay in your arms
One night, could it be that I was born
One night with you
In all honesty
Just one night
To lay in your arms
Just one, just one night, that's all I want baby
Oh yeah
