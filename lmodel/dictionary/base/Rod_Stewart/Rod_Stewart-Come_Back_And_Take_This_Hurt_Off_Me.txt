<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="Come_Back_And_Take_This_Hurt_Off_Me">
Come back and take this hurt off me
Come back and take this hurt off me,
Baby, come back and take this hurt off me.
'Cause I'm too young, to be in misery, now,
Baby, come back and take this hurt off me.
I've been waitin' at the bus station,
'Cause that's where you left me standin'.
Got my clothes in a twenty-five-cent locker,
I'll be here till the Greyhound brings you back again, baby.
I knocked on my mother's door, she said, "Steven, walk on inÂ !
Son, you don't have to say a mumbling word,
she left my little baby again. Yes, she did, now!
Come back and take this hurt off me,
Baby, come back and take this hurt off me,
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby now, what kind of love could this be.
Baby, baby, baby, I don't know what you've done,
It got me, it got me, it got me, yes, it did!
