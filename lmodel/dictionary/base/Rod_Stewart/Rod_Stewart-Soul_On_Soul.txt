<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="Soul_On_Soul">
No one ever told me, no one ever said
No one ever loved me, till I was goin' outta my head
No one ever listened, to the things I tried to say
You gave me everything I needed, that's your way
You gave me hope, you gave me love
You gave me faith to carry on
Good God have mercy on me
Don't you desert me, baby
I wanna be together soul on soul this time
[Believe me, baby] believe me, baby
Don't ever leave me lonely
I wanna be together soul on soul this time
No one ever held me, as good as this before
No one ever stopped me, when I was runnin' out of the door
You set me free, you made me shine
You gave me arms to make you mine
Good God have mercy on me
Don't you desert me, baby
I wanna be together soul on soul this time
[Believe me, baby] believe me, baby
Don't ever leave me lonely
I wanna be together soul on soul this time
Love made me so gun shy
Don't say, don't say another word
Love feels so radical
That I lose my way, when you're here by me
Good God have mercy on me
Don't you desert me, baby
I wanna be together soul on soul this time
[Believe me, baby] believe me, baby
Don't ever leave me lonely
I wanna be together soul on soul this time
Good God have mercy on me (have mercy)
Don't you desert me, baby
I wanna be together soul on soul this time
(I wanna be together soul on soul this time)
[Believe me, baby] believe me, baby (believe me, baby)
Don't ever leave me lonely
(Don't ever, ever leave me)
I wanna be together soul on soul this time (soul on soul this time)
Good God have mercy on me
(Good God have mercy on me)
Don't you desert me, baby
(Don't you desert me, baby)
I wanna be together soul on soul this time (soul on soul this time)
[Believe me, baby] (ooh, ooh) believe me, baby
Don't ever leave me lonely
I wanna be together soul on soul this time
(I wanna be together soul on soul this time)
