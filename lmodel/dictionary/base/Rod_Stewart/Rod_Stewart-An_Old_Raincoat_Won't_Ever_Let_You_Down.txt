<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="An_Old_Raincoat_Won't_Ever_Let_You_Down">
Did you ever stand and shiver
While looking at a freezing river
Have you froze to the bone
With just a coat to keep you warm
To keep you from a howlin' wind
To keep you from a howlin' wind, now listen
Have you perished in the drizzling rain
Tried to light a lift but all in vain
With your sock on your head
And that old coat on your back
To keep you from the drizzlin' rain
Oh, to keep you from the drizzlin' rain, goodbye
One more time
Did you sleep in a graveyard when it snowed
Laid your head on an isle like me
With the Times on your face
And that old coat on your back
That kept you from withering away, good God
It just kept you from withering away
I know
And did you ride a lift on a steam train, now listen
Had the misfortune not to pay your fare
Thrown off the next stop
Thrown in the doorway of a shop
With that coat to keep you from the wind
Oh, that old school coat to keep you from the wind, and that ain't all
Have you had some good friends on the road with ya
Who'd stand by you through thick and thin
Here's to Kevin and Ben, Susie and Len
And that coat which never lets you down
It never, never, never lets you down
It never, never, never lets you down
That old coat which never lets you down
That old coat which never lets you down
Kept me from the drizzlin' rain
And oh, kept me from the drizzlin' rain.
