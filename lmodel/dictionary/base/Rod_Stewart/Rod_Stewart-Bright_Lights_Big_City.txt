<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="Bright_Lights_Big_City">
Bright lights, big city
Gone to my baby's head
Ah bright lights, big city
They've gone to my baby's head
Well I tried to tell you woman
But you don't listen to what I said
Alright, pretty baby
You'll knock yourself out some day
Oh alright, pretty baby
You'll knock yourself out some day
Well I tried to tell you woman
But you don't listen to what I say
