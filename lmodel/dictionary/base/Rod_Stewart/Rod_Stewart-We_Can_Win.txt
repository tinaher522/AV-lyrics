<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="We_Can_Win">
We can win, there's no doubt about it
We can win, with faith in our hearts
Oh-oh, we can win, stand up and shout it
All the world will know, whoa
You can feel the tension in the air
It's in the pubs, it's everywhere
Stadium lights light up the sky
Sixty thousand crammed inside, yeah yeah
Sail on, my dreams
Sail on, my hopes
Oh-oh-oh, we can win, there's no doubt about it
Oh-oh-oh, we can win, with faith in our hearts
Oh-oh-oh, we can win, stand up and shout it
All the world will know, whoa
Our hearts pounding like a train
To some of us it's more than a game (yes, it is)
Ah, my knees are trembling, shredded nerves
The language of the universe
Sail on, my dreams
Sail on, my hopes
Oh-oh-oh, we can win, there's no doubt about it
Oh-oh-oh, we can win, with faith in our hearts
Oh-oh-oh, we can win, stand up and shout it
All the world will know, whoa
Oh-oh-oh, we can win, we won't be divided
Oh-oh-oh, we can win, with God on our side
Oh-oh-oh, we can win, make no mistake about it
All the world will know, whoa, oh yeah
All my life
Why does it mean so much to me?
It's in my blood, my DNA
Here we go
If destiny is in our hands
Stand up for the champions
Sail on, my dreams
Sail on, my hopes
Sail on, my dreams
Sail on, my hopes
Oh-oh-oh, we can win, there's no doubt about it
Oh-oh-oh, we can win, with faith in our hearts
Oh-oh-oh, we can win, stand up and shout it
All the world will know, whoa
Oh-oh-oh, we can win, we won't be divided
Oh-oh-oh, we can win, with God on our side
Oh-oh-oh, we can win, make no mistake about it
All the world will know, whoa, oh yeah
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
We can win
