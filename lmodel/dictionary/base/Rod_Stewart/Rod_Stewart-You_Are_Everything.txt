<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="You_Are_Everything">
Today I saw somebody who looked just like you
She walked like you do I thought it was you
As she turned the corner I called out your name
I felt so ashamed but it wasn't you, wasn't you
You are everything and everything is you
You are everything and everything is you
Oh you are everything and everything is you
How can I forget when each face that I see
Brings back memories of being with you
I just can't go on livin' life as I do
Comparing each girl to you
Knowing they just won't do, they're not you
You are everything
Everything is you
You're everything to me girl
I miss you baby
Everything is you
You are everything
Every little thing
You're all I've got
Girl, you're everything to me
You are everything and everything is you 
Everything to me
