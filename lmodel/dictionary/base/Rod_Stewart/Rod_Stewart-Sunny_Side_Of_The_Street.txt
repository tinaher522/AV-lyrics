<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="Sunny_Side_Of_The_Street">
Grab your coat and get your hat, leave your worry at the doorstep
Just direct your feet to the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear that pitter pat or that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet on the sunny side of the street.
I used to walk in the shade with all them blues on parade
Now I'm not afraid 'cause this rover crossed over.
If I never had a cent, I'll be as rich as Rockefeller
Gold dust at my feet on the sunny side of the street, sunny side of the street.
I used to walk in the shade with all them blues on parade
Now I'm not afraid 'cause this rover crossed over.
 If I never had a cent I'll be as loaded as old Rockefeller
With that gold dust 'round my feet on the sunny side, on the side, side of the street, oh yeah.
