(La la la la ... )
My Cherie Amour, lovely as a summer's day
My Cherie Amour, distant as the Milky Way
My Cherie Amour, pretty little one that I adore
You're the only girl my heart beats for
How I wish that you were mine.
In a cafe or sometimes on a crowded street
I've been near you but you never notice me
My Cherie Amour, won't you tell me how could you ignore
That behind that little smile I wore
How I wish that you were mineÂ ?
Come on.
La la la la ...
Maybe someday you'll see my face among the crowd
Maybe someday I'll share your little distant cloud
Oh, Cherie Amour, pretty little one that I adore
You're the only girl my heart beats for
How I wish that you were mine.
Come on.
(La la la la la la)
La la la la la la 
(La la la la la la)
La la la la la la
