<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="No_Holding_Back">
A friend of mine called up said "I finally had some luck
Could I have a minute of your time
I met a girl last night and try as I might
I can't get her off of my mind
She walked through the room and right then I knew
I finally found somebody for me
But to tell you the truth I don't know what to do
Should I go ahead or wait and see"
I said "Give it all you got no holding back
Let a light in your soul
Ain't it better to lose in love than to never love at all
Than to never love at all"
Now I'm the kind of guy who's normally quite shy
On romance I don't know a thing
But when she led me to the floor I'd never danced before
Suddenly my feet had wings
I know that she wants me I want her too
But I'm so confused I can't think straight
I feel so alive but on the other side
Should I go ahead or should I wait
I said "Give it all you got no holding back
Let a light in your soul
Ain't it better to lose in love than to never love at all
Ain't it better to lose in love than to never love at all
Than to never love at all"
So when the music starts to flow from your hearts
Like the coming of an early spring
When the river starts to flow between you soul to soul
May no man ever come between
Die in her arms if she wants you to
Be thankful for each passing day
When your eyes collide let your spirits fly
And pray to God it's here to stay
And I said "Give it all you got no holding back
Let a light in your soul
Ain't it better to lose in love than to never love at all"
Give it all you got no holding back
Let a light in your soul
Ain't it better to lose in love than to never love at all
Than to never love at all
Than to never, never love at all
Ain't it better to lose in love than never love at all
