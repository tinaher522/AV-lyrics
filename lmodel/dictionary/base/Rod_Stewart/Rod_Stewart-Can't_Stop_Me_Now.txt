<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="Can't_Stop_Me_Now">
Oh, yeah
I stood up straight and sang 
for the record company man 
My enthusiasm filled the room 
I was young and I was keen 
With the devil in my stream 
As I hollard out an old blues tune 
We can't sign you son
'Cause you don't fit in the mold
it's hair and it's your nose and your clothes 
I said, thank you gentleman 
I'll just
 move on down the road 
I remember how I used to say 
They can't stop me now 
The world is waiting 
It's my turn to stand out in the crowd 
They can't stop me now 
The tide is turning 
I'm gonna make you proud 
So proud, so proud
Well it was rough and it was tough 
But I couldn't get enough 
of this rhythm and blues I craved 
I was singing in the pubs 
Singing in the clubs 
Then along came Maggie May
All the things he said to me 
And all the things I heard 
I had a point to prove oh yeah
I will climb this mountain 
With this God given gift 
If it's the last thing that I do 
And I remember thinking:
They can't stop me now 
The world is waiting 
It's my turn to stand out in the crowd 
They can't stop me now 
The tide is turning 
I'm gonna make you proud 
They can't stop me now 
The world is waiting 
It's my turn to stand out in the crowd 
They can't stop me now 
The tide is turning 
I'm gonna make you proud 
Born to ramble 
Born to sing 
In a new world of rock'n'roll 
One man in particular 
Filled my heart with pride 
And he fired up my soul... oh yeah
Thanks for the faith 
Thanks for the patience 
Thanks for the helping hand 
Thanks for the love 
Thanks for the guidance 
Thanks for the tartan pride 
They can't stop me now 
The world is waiting 
It's my turn to stand out in the crowd 
They can't stop me now 
The tide is turning 
I'm gonna make you proud 
They can't stop me now 
The world is waiting 
It's my turn to stand out in the crowd 
They can't stop me now 
The tide is turning 
I'm gonna make you proud
So proud, so proud
They can't stop me now...
