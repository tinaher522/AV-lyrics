<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="Two_Shades_Of_Blue">
Pack your bags and your radio
You don't live here anymore
Take your time as you walk out that door
I don't cry us any long
It don't matter what you wear
It's all over now cry
Two shades of blue
Tangled up in you
Don't be sad if I say the wrong thing
I don't lecture any more
Take a walk on the wild side now
Love don't live here anymore
I don't worry about no space
When all is said and done
Two shades of blue
Tangled up in you
Slow down honey by that door
Wait for no one anymore
Crying tender with your arms spread wide
Hold on cry not anymore
I don't worry what dress you wear
It's all over now my dear
Two shades of blue
Tangled up in you
