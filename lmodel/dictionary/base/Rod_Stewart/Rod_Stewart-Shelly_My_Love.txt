Shelly my love
I only long to be where you are
Shelly my love
Now and forevermore
Shelly my love
When I see you I catch fire
And soon I'm all aflame
I feel it start
Whenever you call my name
All around I feel a passion
That thrills my very soul
I put it down
To that I love you so
Shelly my love
I only long to be where you are
Shelly my love
Now and forevermore
Shelly my love
Oh Shelly my love
All around I feel a passion
That thrills my very soul
I put it down
To that I love you so
Oh Shelly my love
If this time I'm into somethin'
That is not of this world
The love I've got
It's supernatural, girl
Shelly my love
I only long to be where you are
Shelly my love
Now and forevermore
Shelly my love
Shelly, my love
Shelly, my love
Shelly, my love
