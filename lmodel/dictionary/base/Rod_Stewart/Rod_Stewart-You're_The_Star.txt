<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="You're_The_Star">
You gave me hope
When all around was lost
And I could see no point in trying
For I saw love passing me by
You came into my life
You came into my life
I look around
And what I had is gone
Now I've finally found
What I've been missing
The road I travel is so clear
Since you came into my life
You came into my life
And you're the star
The shining light
The morning dawn
And when the sun
Comes up so bright
And the closer I get
Yes it's true
You're the star
Above the storm
I want to wrap you in my arms
And keep you warm
No I don't want to live without you
No I've never found loving like you
You gave me faith
The kind I thought had gone
Somewhere down the line
I think I've lost it
Now I've felt the changes in my heart
Your faith in me is strong
Your faith in me is strong
And you're the star
The shining light
The morning dawn
And when the sun
Comes up so bright
And the closer I get
Yes it's true
