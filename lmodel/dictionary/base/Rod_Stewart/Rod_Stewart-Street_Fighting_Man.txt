<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="Street_Fighting_Man">
Everywhere I hear the sound 
Of marching, charging feet boy
Cause the summer's here 
And the time is right for 
Fighting in the street boy
Hey think the time is right
For a palace revolution
Where I live the game to play 
Is just to compromise my solution
What can a poor boy do 
Except to sing for a rock 'n' roll band
Cause you see bein' London town 
There's just no other place 
For a street fighting man
Hey did I tell you that my name 
Was called disturbance
And I'll shout and scream 
And I'll kill the king and 
I'll rail at all his servants
What can a poor boy do 
Except to sing for a rock 'n' roll band
Cause you see bein' London town 
There's just no place 
For a street fighting man
Everywhere I hear the sound 
Of marching, charging feet boy
Cause the summer's here 
And the time is right for 
Fighting in the street boy
What can a poor boy do 
Except to sing for a rock 'n' roll band
Cause you see bein' London town 
There's just no other place 
For a street fighting man
