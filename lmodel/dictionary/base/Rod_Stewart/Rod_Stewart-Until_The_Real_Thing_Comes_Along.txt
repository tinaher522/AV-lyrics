<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="Until_The_Real_Thing_Comes_Along">
I'd work for you, I'd even slave for you
I'd be a beggar or a knave for you
If that isn't love, it'll have to do
Until the real thing comes along
I'd gladly move the earth for you
To prove my love, dear, and it's worth for you
If that isn't love, it'll have to do
Until the real thing comes along
With all the words, dear, at my command
I just can't make you understand
I'll always love you, darling, come what may
My heart is yours, what more can I say?
I'd sigh for you, I'd cry for you
I'd tear the stars down from the skies for you
If that isn't love, it'll have to do
Until the real thing comes along
With all the words, dear, at my command
I just can't make you understand
I'll always love you, baby, come what may
My heart is yours, what more can I say?
I'd lie for you, I'll cry for you
I'd lay my body down and die for you
But if that isn't love, it's gonna have to do
Until the real thing comes along
Until the real thing comes along
