<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="You've_Really_Got_A_Hold_On_Me">
I don't like you but I love you
Seems that I'm always thinking of you
Oh, you treat me badly, I love you madly
You've really got a hold on me
You've really got a hold on me, baby
I don't want you but I need you
Don't want to kiss you but I need to
Oh, you do me wrong now, my love is strong now
You've really got a hold on me
You've really got a hold on me, baby
I love you and all I want you to do is
Just hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Tighter, tighter
I wanna leave you, don't wanna stay here
Don't wanna spend another day here
Oh, I wanna split now, I can't quit now
You've really got a hold on me
You've really got a hold on me, baby
I love you and all I want you to do is
Just hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
You've really got a hold on me
I said you've really got a hold on me, baby
You've really got a hold on me
Oh, you've really got a hold on me
I said you've really got a hold on me
