<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="I_Wouldn't_Ever_Change_A_Thing">
I wouldn't change a thing if I could live it all again
Ah listen
It's funny you know when you sit down 
and think about what you had
About the friends you used to know 
What happened, where did they all go
Can you remember happy hours 
spent drinkin' and thinkin'
We thought we could change the world
And we never, never, never, never, never 
never thought we could get much older then
We were the ones who loved to love the right to love
We'd bring it on home with the right song 
played at the right time
What happened to the girl that you loved once and left 
young man did you break her heart
Did she live, and did she marry, 
did she ever think on your face again
Ah now hold on a minute
I wouldn't change a thing if I could live it all again
Ah yeah
I think what you say is all so right 
but I find it hard to jog my memories
Don't worry Lou you may never get another chance yeah
Yes I think what you say is all so right 
but I find it hard to move my memories
Say it again with a lot more feelin'
And I think what you say is all so right 
but I find it hard to find my memories
Don't sing so serious you make me feel so sad
But if I was true to myself 
I would probably find it was a tear in my eye
that stopped me from believing you
Don't worry, don't worry, don't worry don't worry
You know my tongue gets tired 
when I think back on all of the things we do
But I wonder if I'll remember these few precious things
as years pass me by
Ah when young bodies that've grown older 
and mind's become dimmer     
I'll point the finger back in time
I said I wouldn't change a thing if I could 
if I could, if I could live it all again, yeah
