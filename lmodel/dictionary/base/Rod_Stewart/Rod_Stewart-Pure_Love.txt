<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="Pure_Love">
If an old friend lets you down 
And a true love can't be found 
Till the blue skies come around 
I'll be right by your side 
Journey far and travel safe 
Make this world a better place 
And keep that smile upon your face 
I'll be right by your side 
There may be oceans in between us now 
But I think about you every minute now 
No don't forget me now that we're apart 
Just open up that great big loving heart 
And you'll always be 
You'll always be 
You'll always be a part of me
Take your time to embrace romance 
Teach your children how to sing and dance 
Love may hurt but it's worth the chance 
I'll be right by your side 
Try to be the best you can 
Show compassion to every man 
And always take the higher ground 
I'll be right by your side 
I hear your laughter echo through this house 
I miss all of this there is no doubt 
I wasn't perfect this I would admit 
I was always tryin' to make the pieces fit 
And you'll always be 
You'll always be 
You'll always be a part of me
Don't ask me now the time has gone 
I've loved you since the minute you were born 
So many times we have laughed and cried 
I see you now it fills my heart with pride 
You'll always be 
You'll always be 
You'll always be a part of me.
