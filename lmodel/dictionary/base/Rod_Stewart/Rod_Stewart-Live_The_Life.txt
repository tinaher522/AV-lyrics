<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="Live_The_Life">
You wrote it in your email that you're sad and lonely 
'Cause a girl in college has stolen your heart 
And so my estimation of the situation 
Is I bet you can't stand being apart 
Listen son you goin' to find a sense of perspective 
Ain't no use to bury your weight in the sand 
Although I kinda like your revolutionary spirit 
You know you got to fall before you learn how to stand 
Nobody's gonna know what it's like 
To walk a mile in your shoes 
Sachmo sang it's a wonderful world 
What you make of it is up to you 
Let yourself fly, let yourself cry 
And years will disappear in a blink of an eye 
There's music in your head, it holds onto your plans 
it'll be be heaven when shes in your arms 
So love the life you live 
And live the life you love 
Everybody here has been asking about you 
When's that boy of yours gonna be coming home 
And when I hear the bells ringing down at the school yard 
Kinda reminds me of when you were young 
You know you gotta polarize your concentration 
I know that girl of yours gonna understand 
Never underestimate the power of affection 
When you got the world in the palm of your hands 
Don't go looking for the pot of gold 
Or the light miracle mile 
Happiness lies in your own backyard 
But finding it could take a while 
Walk down the aisle, with that big old smile 
Collect your diploma with your head up high 
Study with your soul,to reach that goal 
But always remember, let the good times roll 
And love the life you live 
And live the life you love 
Nobody's gonna know what it's like 
To walk a mile in your shoes 
Sachmo sang it's a wonderful world 
What you make of it is up to you 
So walk by the lake hand in hand 
Try and see the sunset in the foriegn land 
Tell her you love her don't be afraid 
And keep every promise that you ever made 
And love the life you live 
Live the life you love 
Love the life you live 
Live the life you love 
You gotta love it 
You gotta love it 
Make the most of it 
You only got one chance 
So take it with your hands 
Love the life you live.
