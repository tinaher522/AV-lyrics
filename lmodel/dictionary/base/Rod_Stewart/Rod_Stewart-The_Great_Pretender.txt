<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="The_Great_Pretender">
Oh yes, oh yes.
Oh yes, I'm the great pretender.
Pretendin' that I'm doin' well.
My need is such, I pretend too much.
I'm lonely, but no one can tell.
Oh yes, I'm the great pretender.
Laughing out loud like a clown.
I seem to be, what I'm not you see.
I'm wearin' my heart like a clown.
Pretendin' that you're still around.
Too real is this feeling of make believe.
Too real when I feel what my heart can't conceal.
Oh yes, I'm the great pretender. 
Adrift in a world of my own.
I play the game, but to my real shame.
You'd left me to dream on my own.
Pretending that I'm not alone.
Too real is this feeling of make believe.
Too real when I feel what my heart can't conceal.
Ooooh yes, I'm the great pretender.
Pretendin' that I'm doin' well.
My need is such, I pretend too much
I'm lonely but no one can tell.
I'm lonely but no one can tell.
I'm still pretendin'
Yeah
