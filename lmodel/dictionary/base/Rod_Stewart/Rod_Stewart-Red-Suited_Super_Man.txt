Listen!
The tree is ready and the stockings are all hung
The fire is blazing and the carols are all sung
Everybody's waiting for a miracle,
So Santa bring some joy to us all
It's the season to leave our troubles behind
How amazing if the world was giving and kind
It might be crazy, it might take a miracle
Santa bring some peace to us all
If anyone can do it, it's Santa who can
He's red suited super superman
He knows everybody, got a list with all our names
And he rocks the whole world in that old fashioned sleigh
Come over here baby, let's watch the snow fall
Check out the North star, didn't it start it all?
It's still shinin', that's a miracle
So Santa bring some hope to us all
He's a red suited super superman
And he rocks the whole world in that old fashioned sleigh
I look around me, what else could I need?
All my friends and family, so I gotta believe
Life is a blessing for every boy and girl
So Santa bring some love to us all
I said Santa bring some love to us all
I mean Santa! I said Santa!
Bring some love to us all
Oooh bring us, bring us
Just a little peace and love on this Earth
Santa, Santa, I believe in Santa
Oh yes I do, oh yes I do.
