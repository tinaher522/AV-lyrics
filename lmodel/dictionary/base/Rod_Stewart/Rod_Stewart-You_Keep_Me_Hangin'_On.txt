<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="You_Keep_Me_Hangin'_On">
Set me free why don't you baby
Get out of my life why don't you baby
You really don't want me
You just keep me hanging on
You really don't need me
You just keep me hanging on
Why do you keep coming around
Playing with my heart
Why don't you get out of my life
And help me to make a new start
Let me get over you
The way you got over me 
Set me free why don't you baby
Get out of my life why don't you baby
You really don't want me child
You just keep me hanging on
You never, never, never needed me
You just keep me hanging on
You said when we broke up
You just wanted to be friends
Tell me, how can we still be friends
When seeing you just breaks my heart again
And there ain't nothing I can do about it
You really don't need me
You just keep me hanging on
You really don't need me baby
You just keep me hanging on
Set me free why don't you baby
Set me free why don't you baby
Get out of my life why don't you honey
You just keep me hanging on
