Well don't you tell nobody
Well don't you tell nobody
Yeah, don't you tell nobody
Baby, what we gone and done
Well, you made me weak and you made me old
You make me do the things that I knew was wrong
You made me jump and then you made me shout
Early in the mornin', then ya' knocked me out
Well don't you tell nobody
Well don't you tell nobody
Yeah, don't you tell nobody
Baby, what we gone and done
Well, don't tell nobody
Well don't you tell nobody
Well don't you tell nobody
Yeah, don't you tell nobody
Baby, what we gone and done
Well, you made me happy then you made me sad
You made me feel good, then you made me bad
You made me jump and then you made me shout
Early in the mornin', then you knocked me out
Don't you tell nobody
Well don't you tell nobody
Yeah, don't you tell nobody
Baby, what we gone and done
Well, don't tell nobody
Well don't you tell nobody
Well don't you tell nobody
Yeah, don't you tell nobody
Baby, what we gone and done
Well, you made me happy then you made me sad
You made me feel good, then you made me bad
You made me jump and then you made me shout
Early in the mornin', then you knocked me out
Well don't you tell nobody
Well don't you tell nobody
Yeah, don't you tell nobody
Baby, what we gone and done, oh yeah
