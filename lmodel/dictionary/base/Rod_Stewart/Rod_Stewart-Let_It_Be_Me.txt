<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="Let_It_Be_Me">
Bécaud-Kurtz-Leroyer
I bless the day I found you
I want to stay around you
And so I beg you, let it be me.
Don’t take this heaven from one
If you must cling to someone
Now and forever, let it be me.
Each time we meet love
I find complete love
Oh, without your sweet love what would life be ?
So never leave me lonely
Tell me you love me only
And that you’ll always let it be me.
And that you’ll always let it be me.
Each time we meet love
I find complete love
Oh, without your sweet love what would life be ?
So never leave me lonely
Tell me you love me only
And that you’ll always let it be me, let it be me, let it be me ...
