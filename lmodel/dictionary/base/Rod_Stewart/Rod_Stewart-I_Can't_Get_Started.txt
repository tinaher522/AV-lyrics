<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="I_Can't_Get_Started">
I've flown around the world in a plane
I've settled revolutions in Spain
The North Pole I have charted
But I can't get started with you
And at the golf course I'm under par
And in Hollywood they wants me to star
I've got a house and a show place
But I can't get no place with you
You're so supreme
The lyrics I write of you
Scheme just for the sight of you
Dream, both day and night of you
But what good does it do
In nineteen ninety-nine, I sold short
In England, I'm presented at court
Yeah you've got me so down-hearted
'Cause I'll never get started with you
You're so supreme
The lyrics I write of you
Scheme just for the sight of you
Dream, both day and night of you
But what, what good does it do
I've been consulted by Hilary C.
And Tina Turner had me to tea
But now I'm broken hearted
Cause I can't get started with you
Yeah I'm broken hearted
Cause I can't get started with you
