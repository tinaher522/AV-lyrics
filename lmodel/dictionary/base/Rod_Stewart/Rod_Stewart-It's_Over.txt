<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="It's_Over">
The congregation sang
We knelt and prayed
As we stood before God
On that beautiful day
The church bells rang
And the champagne flowed
As our friends gather 'round
For the wedding photo
But here we are barely five years on
An' our whole world's fallin' apart
All the plans we had together
Up in smoke and gone forever
Poisoned by a lawyer's letter
It's over
I don't want our kids to suffer
Can we talk to one another?
You were once my wife, my lover
It's over
Rumours and whispers tear me apart
But I know you better than that
Inseparable were we
With the breeze in our sails
Now I feel a chill wind
On the marriage that fell
And our friends are divided
They've taken their sides
Now they'll all sit back
And watch the circus unwind
I don't stand here tryin' to focus the blame
But I'm hurtin' deep down inside
All the pain an' all the grievin'
When did we stop believin'?
Too late now to stop the bleedin'
It's over
What's the sense in pointin' fingers?
Who's the saint an' who's the sinner?
There ain't gonna be a winner
It's over
Oh, my dear, what happened to us?
Tell me, where did it all go wrong?
What's the use in keep on fightin'?
All the tears, all the cryin'
Why do we keep denyin'?
It's over
In all the time I thought I knew ya
Don't forget our children's future
I would do whatever suits ya
Oh yeah!
It's over
It's over
Yeah, it's over.
