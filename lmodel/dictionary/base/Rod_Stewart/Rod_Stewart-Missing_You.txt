<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="Missing_You">
Missing you...
Every time I think of you, I always catch my breath
And I'm still standing here, and you're miles away
And I'm wonderin' why you left
And there's a storm that's raging through my frozen heart
Tonight
I hear your name in certain circles, and it always makes me smile
I spend my time thinkin' about you, and it's almost driving me wild
And there's a heart that's breaking down this long distance line tonight
I ain't missing you at all since you've been gone away
I ain't missing you, no matter what I might say
There's a message in the wire, and I'm sending you this signal tonight
You don't know how desperate I've become
And it looks like I'm losing this fight
In your world I have no meaning, though I'm trying hard to understand
And it's my heart that's breaking down this long distance line tonight
I ain't missing you at all
Since you've been gone away
I ain't missing you,
No matter what my friend's missing
And there's a message that I'm sending out,
Like a telegraph to your soul
And if I can't bridge this distance,
Stop this heartbreak Overload
I ain't missing you,
I ain't missing you,
I can lie to Myself
And there's a storm
That's raging through my frozen heart tonight
I ain't missing you at all
Since you've been gone away
I ain't missing you,
No matter what my friend's missing
I ain't missing you
I ain't missing you
I can't lie to myself
I ain't missing you
I ain't missing you
I ain't missing you
I'm lying to myself
Oh yes
I ain't missing you
Missing you...
