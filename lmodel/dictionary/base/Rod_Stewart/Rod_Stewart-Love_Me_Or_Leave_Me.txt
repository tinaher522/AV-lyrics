<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="Love_Me_Or_Leave_Me">
This suspense is killing me
I can't stand uncertainty
Tell me now, I've got to know
Whether you want me to stay or go.
Love me or leave me or let me be lonely
You won't believe me but I love you only
I'd rather be lonely then happy with somebody else.
You might find the night time, the right time for kissin'
But night time is my time for just reminiscin'
Regrettin' instead of forgettin' with somebody else.
There'll be no one unless that someone is you
I intend to be independently blue.
I want your love but I don't want to borrow
Have it today and give back tomorrow
For my love is your love, there's no love for nobody else, nobody else.
Oh yeah.
(Leave me, baby)
There'll be no one unless that someone is you
I intend to be independently blue.
I want your love but I don't want to borrow
So have it today andgive back tomorrow
My love is your love, there's no love for nobody else
There's no love for nobody else.
