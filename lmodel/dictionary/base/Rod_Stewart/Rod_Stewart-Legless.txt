<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="Legless">
I've been working all of my life 
Tryin' to make a dollar last 
Well in this morning my telephone rang 
As I was putting out the trash 
Excuse me sir are you Mr. Jones? 
I said yes Ma'am I surely am 
Congratulations sir you're a lottery winner 
You're a rich man the rest of your life 
I'm in the mood I'm in the mood to get legless tonight 
I'm in the mood I'm in the mood to get loaded tonight 
We get all dressed up and we goin' downtown 
In one of them long black limousines 
We celebrating with all of our friends 
At the paradise ball and grill 
I serve my country in Vietnam 
And made my life on the line 
But tonight I'm letting down I'm selecting my air 
With some good champagne and wine 
I'm in the mood I'm in the mood to get legless tonight 
I'm in the mood I'm in the mood to get loaded tonight 
All my taxes paid to good old Uncle Sam 
I'm a no nonsense kind of guy 
I'm a hardworking man I'm an honest man 
But tonight I'm gonna let me go 
I'm in the mood I'm in the mood to get legless tonight 
I'm in the mood I'm in the mood to get loaded tonight 
I'm in the mood I'm in the mood to get legless tonight 
I'm in the mood I'm in the mood to get shit faced tonight.
