<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="My_Foolish_Heart">
The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care, my foolish heart.
There's a line between love and fascination
That's so hard to see on an evening such as this
For they give the very same sensation
When you are lost in the passion of a kiss.
For your lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start.
For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love this time, it's love, my foolish heart.
There's a line between love and fascination
That's so hard to see on an evening such as this
For they give the very same sensation
When you are lost in the passion of a kiss, oh yeah.
Your lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start.
For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love this time, it's love, my foolish heart
