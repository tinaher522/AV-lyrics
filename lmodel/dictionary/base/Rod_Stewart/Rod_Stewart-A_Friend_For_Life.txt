<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="A_Friend_For_Life">
Through a smoke-filled glass on a desperate night
When the sole of my shoe lets in rain
When the heart's tired of running and the milk's gone sour
Will your feelings still be the same?
When the match won't light so the flames don't tremble
And the years are condemning us too
I'll need a soulmate to hold me and a friend for life
And I'm hoping it might be you
When I think of life as a chance not taken
Or as a compromise tinged with regret
When the kids leave for breeding and the TV's king
Will you tell me we're not done yet?
Will you think of me as a distant island
Or will you come with me to the moon?
I'll need a soulmate to hold me and a friend for life
And I'm hoping it might be you
Give me asylum and I'll keep the faith
Keep me in coffee and so safe
And I'll feed your cats and I'll paint walls
And I'll be your one night stand
Will you come with me in the certain knowledge
That the catch is there's no catch at all?
I'll need a soulmate to hold me and a friend for life
And I'm hoping it might be you
Yes, I'm certain it must be you.
