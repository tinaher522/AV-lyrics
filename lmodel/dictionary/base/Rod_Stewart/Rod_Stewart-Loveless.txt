<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="Loveless">
La, la, la, la
Whatcha doin', whatcah doin', whatcha doin' right now
Have you found another lover, are you out of town
I won't leave another message right after the tone
Cause I know you got the others and you still don't call
There's no magic (no magic) no sunshine (sunshine)
No rainbow (no rainbow) in my life
Look at all the things you took from me
Baby, I'm loveless (loveless)
Feelin' so hopeless (hopeless)
Feelin' so foolish (foolish)
For bein' so helpless 
Baby, I'm loveless (loveless)
It's like you couldn't care less (care less)
If you did, you'd come right back to me
Ooh... la, la, la, la
Tell me what I'm gonna do about this feelin' inside
(What I'm gonna do)
Got me tossin' and turnin' in the middle of the night
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Like an animal strugglin' in a trap
Cause I can't go forward and I can't go back (I can't go back)
There's no springtime (no springtime) just winter (winter)
And each mile (and each mile) gets colder
Look at all that pain you took from me
Baby, I'm loveless (loveless)
Feelin' so hopeless (hopeless)
Feelin' so foolish (foolish)
For bein' so helpless 
Baby, I'm loveless (loveless)
It's like you couldn't care less (care less)
If you did, you'd come right back to me
(Why did you leave me)
Why did you leave me
(Why did you leave me) [why did you leave me]
[Why did you leave me]
Why did, why did
And the sun don't shine 
It's just wintertime
And every night 
There's no one in my life
Look at all the things you took from me
Baby, I'm loveless (loveless)
Feelin' so hopeless (hopeless)
Feelin' so foolish (foolish)
For bein' so helpless 
Baby, I'm loveless (loveless)
It's like you couldn't care less (care less)
If you did, you'd come right back 
I'm loveless (loveless)
Feelin' so hopeless (hopeless)
Feelin' so foolish (foolish)
For bein' so helpless 
Baby, I'm loveless (loveless)
It's like you couldn't care less (care less)
If you did, you'd come right back 
I'm loveless (loveless)
Feelin' so hopeless (hopeless)
Feelin' so foolish (foolish)
For bein' so helpless 
Baby, I'm loveless (loveless)
It's like you couldn't care less (care less)
