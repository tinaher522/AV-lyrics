<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="Can_You?">
As I look at my days and my years gone by,
I try so hard to find good things I've done.
Yet the closer I get to seeing any of them,
They somehow fade, go dim, and disappear -
Just not able to see them, can you?
I've been told about lots of good I've done.
I've been told by some they're even proud of me,
But it seems each time I'm told anything good,
It somehow fades, goes dim, and disappears -
Just not able to see them, can you?
I've written things for so many years...
Articles, opinions, poetry, and rhyme,
But never brave enough to show anyone.
Seems I can dream of how they're going to go,
But then I wake &amp; they fade, go dim, and disappear -
Just not able to see them, can you?
Notepad by my pillows, to catch the words swarming in my head -
The words are good, and I'm quite sure of it!
They could all make me some money,
But again I wake, and they fade, go dim, and disappear -
Just not able to see them, can you?
