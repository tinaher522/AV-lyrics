<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="Weak">
Lost in time
I can't count the words
I said when I thought
They went unheard
All of these harsh thought
So unkind
"Cause I wanted you
I wanted you
And now I sit here
I'm all alone
So here sits a bloody mess
Tears fly home
A circle of angels
Deep in war
'Cause I wanted you
I wanted you
Weak as I am - No tears for you
Weak as I am - No tears for you
Deep as I am - I'm no one's fool - Weak as I am
So what am I now
But love's last home
I'm all of the soft words
I once owned
If I opened my heart
There'd be no space for air
'cause I wanted you
I wanted you
Weak as I am - No tears for you
Weak as I am - No tears for you
Deep as I am - I'm no one's fool - Weak as I am
With this changing soul
In this weak old heart
Oh baby, ain't I too much for you
With this changing soul
In this weak old heart
Oh baby, ain't I too much for you
Weak as I am - No tears for you
Weak as 'I'm nobody's fool
Deep as I am - No tears for you - Weak as I am
Weak as I am - I'm too much for you
Weak as I am - No tears for you
Weak as I am - I'm nobody's fool
Weak as I am, weak as I am, weak as I am,
Weak as I am, weak as I am
