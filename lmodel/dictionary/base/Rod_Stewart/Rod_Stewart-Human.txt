Ah...
Ah...Ah...
Ah...
Ah...human
I been lookin' in the mirror somethin's gettin' clearer
Wonderin' who am I
Just a chemical solution caught in evolution
Only livin' to survive
Or am I just another lifetime lookin' for a lifeline
Cryin' when the sun don't shine
Am I runnin' through the ghetto maybe I should let go
Of all the dreams inside
But who am I to reach so high
And who am I to raise my eyes
Want to live
I want to die
I can't do anything I'll tell you why
I'm the one who took a walk on the moon
And I made the seven wonders too
There is nothin' that I cannot do
Cause I am human
There is nothing that I cannot be
I'm the one who sailed the seven seas
And I know that it is all in me
Cause I am human
The blood that's runnin' through my veins 
It tells me I'm the same as all the other ones gone by
In the air that I am breathin', emotions that I'm feelin'
Underneath the same blue sky
And I know if I believe it, then I can achieve it
Nothin's standin' in my way
Then maybe history will make a place for me
And I'll be livin' for that day
But who am I to reach so high
And who am I to raise my eyes
Want to live
I want to die
I can't do anything I'll tell you why
I'm the one who took a walk on the moon
And I made the seven wonders too
There is nothin' that I cannot do
Cause I am human
There is nothing that I cannot be
I'm the one who sailed the seven seas
And I know that it is all in me
Cause I am human
Not born to make mistakes, not born to fade away
Not only livin' to survive
Don't tell me I am nothin', know that I am somethin'
Brother, don't ya realise
I'm the one who took a walk on the moon
And I made the seven wonders too
There is nothin' that I cannot do
Cause I am human
There is nothing that I cannot be
I'm the one who sailed the seven seas
And I know that it is all in me
Cause I am human
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
I'm the one
I am human
Oh, yeah
Ah...
Ah...ah...
Ah...
Ah...human
