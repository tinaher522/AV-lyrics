<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="That's_All_Right">
That's all right my mama, that's all right for you
That's all right my mama any old way you do
But that's all right, well that's all right
Well that's all right my mama
Any way that you wanna do
My mother she did tell me 
Papa did tell me too
Son, that woman that you're foolin' with 
She ain't no good for you
I'll be leaving here tomorrow 
Leaving here for sure
You ain't gotta be bothered with me 
Hangin' 'round your door
