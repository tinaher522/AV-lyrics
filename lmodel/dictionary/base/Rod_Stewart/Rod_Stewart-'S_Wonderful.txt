<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="'S_Wonderful">
's wonderful, 's marvelous
You should care for me!
's awful nice, 's paradise,
's what I love to see.
You've made my life so glamorous,
You can't blame me for feeling amorous!
Oh 's wonderful, 's marvelous,
That you should care for me!
My dear, it's four leaved clover time,
From now on my heart's working overtime, ooh baby
's wonderful, 's marvelous
That you should care for
You've made my life so glamorous,
You can't blame me for feeling amorous!
And I guess so it's wonderful, and it's marvelous,
That you should care for, that you should care for
That you should care for me!
