<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="Superstar">
Feels like I'm going insane
I'm losing my brain
I can't stand the pain I'm feleing
Open my arms they don't reach
I want you to teach me
What do I do now baby
Cry every day I exist
I want to be missed
I want to be needed baby
Don't want to put on a show
So where do I go
And what do I do now baby
Sometimes it seems to me
Like my whole world's falling apart
I miss you so much dear
Won't you come back to my arms
Thoughts spinning round in my head
About things that you said
I want to be sleeping baby
Open my eyes there's no one
The damage is done
Oh what can I do now baby
