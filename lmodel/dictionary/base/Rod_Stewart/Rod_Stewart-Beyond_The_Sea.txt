<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="Beyond_The_Sea">
Somewhere beyond the sea
Somewhere waiting for me
My lover stands on golden sand
And watches the ships that go sailing.
Somewhere beyond the sea
She's there watching for me
If I could fly like birds on high
Fell straight to her arms I'd go sailing.
It's far beyond the stars
It's near beyond the moon
I know beyond a doubt
My heart will leave me there soon, yeah.
I know beyond a doubt
My heart will leave me there soon, yeah.
We'll meet, I know weâ€™ll meet beyond the shore
We'll kiss just as before
Happy we'll be beyond the sea
And never again I'll go sailing 
And never again I'll go sailing
My heart will leave me
Beyond the sea ...
