<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="She's_Funny_That_Way">
I'm not much to look at, I'm nothing to see
I'm just glad I'm living, lucky to be
I've got a woman who's crazy 'bout me
She's funny that way.
I can't save a dollar, I ain't worth a cent
She doesn't holler, she'd live in a tent
I've got a woman, crazy 'bout me
She's funny that way.
Though she loves to work and slave for me every day
She'd be so much better off if I went away.
Oh, but why should I leave her?  Why should I goÂ ?
She'd be unhappy without me, I know
I've got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.
I've got a woman mad about for me
She's funny, she's how so funny, funny that way.
