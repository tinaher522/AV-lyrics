<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="I_Get_A_Kick_Out_Of_You">
I get no kick from Champagne
Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all
So tell me why should it be true
That I get a kick out of youÂ ?
I get no kick from cocaine
I'm sure that if I heard even one sniff
It would bore me terrifically too 
But I get a kick out of you .
I get a kick every time I see you
Standin' there before me
I get a kick though it's clear to see
You obviously don't adore me.
I get no kick kick in a plane
Flying too high with some girl in the sky 
Is my idea of nothing to do
But I get a kick out of you.
I get a kick every time I see you
Standin' there before me
I get a kick though it's clear to see
That you obviously do not adore me.
I get no kick kick in a plane, oh yeah
Flying too high with some girl in the sky 
Is my idea of nothing to do, you know what, babe
I get a kick, you give me a thrill, I get a kick out of you.
