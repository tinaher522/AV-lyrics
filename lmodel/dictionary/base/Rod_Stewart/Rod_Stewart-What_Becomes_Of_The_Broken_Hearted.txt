<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="What_Becomes_Of_The_Broken_Hearted">
As I walk this land of broken dreams
I have visions of many things
Love's happiness is just an illusion
Filled with sadness and confusion.
What becomes of the broken hearted ?
Who had love that's now departed ?
I know I've got to find some kind of peace of mind, maybe. 
The fruits of love grow all around
But for me they come a tumblin' down
Every day heartaches grow a little stronger
I can't stand this pain much longer.
I walk in shadows, searching for light
Cold and alone, no comfort in sight
Hoping and praying for someone to care
Always moving and going nowhere.
What becomes of the broken hearted ?
Who had love that's now departed ?
I know I've got to find some kind of peace of mind, maybe.
I'm searching though I don't succeed
But someone look, there's a growing need
Oh, he is lost, there's no place for beginning
All that's left is an unhappy ending.
Now what's become of the broken-hearted ?
Who had love that's now departed ?
I know I've got to find some kind of peace of mind
I'll be searching everywhere just to find someone to care
I'll be looking everyday, I know I'm gonna find a way
Nothing's gonna stop me now, I'll find a way somehow
I'll be searching everywhere ...
