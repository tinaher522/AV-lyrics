<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="Baby,_It's_Cold_Outside">
I really can't stay - Baby it's cold outside
I've got to go away - Baby it's cold outside
This evening has been - Been hoping that you'd drop in
So very nice - I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice
My mother will start to worry - Beautiful, what's your hurry
And my father will be pacing the floor - Just listen to the fireplace roar
Now really I'd better scurry - Sweetheart, what's your hurry
Well maybe just a half a drink more - Just put some record on while I pour
All the neighbors might think - But baby, it's bad out there
Say, what's in this drink - No cabs to be had out there
Oh I wish I knew how - Your eyes are like starlight now
To break this spell - I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell
I ought to say no, no, no, sir - Mind if I move a little closer
At least I'm gonna say that I tried - What's the sense in hurting my pride
I really can't stay - Baby don't hold out
Ohh, but it's cold outside
I simply must go - Baby, it's cold outside
The answer is no - But baby, it's cold outside out there
Oh this welcome has been - So lucky that you dropped in
So nice and warm - Look out the window at that storm
My sister will be suspicious - God, your lips look so delicious
My brother will be there at the door - Waves upon a tropical shore
Oh my maiden aunt's mind is vicious - Oh baby you're so delicious
Well maybe just one little kiss more - Never such a blizzard before
Oh I've got to go home - You'll freeze out there
Say, lend me a comb - It's up to your knees out there
You've really been grand - I swell when you touch my hand
But don't you see - How can you do this thing to me
Oh,there's bound to be talk tomorrow - Making my lifelong sorrow
Well at least there will be plenty implied - If you caught pneumonia and died
But I really can't stay - Get over that old out
Baby it's cold outside
Hey, I gotta get out of here
Come on, baby
Come on what?
Just give me five minutes more
You're sureÂ ???, don't you
Okay, okay, okay, okay
