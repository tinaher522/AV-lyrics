<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="Move_Me">
It's obvious darlin' 
You've become allergic to me
Are my trousers to wide
Do I drink and get mean
Is my demeanor that embarrassing
Are my jokes obsolete
Or is it my sweat that's no longer sweet
I work hard in the factory 
To keep you in luxury
To which you've grown accustomed and you love
Lately you don't light my fuse
Is my fan belt coming loose
Punch me in the Bible baby please                 
Move me, move me, move me when I'm home
Why don't you move me, move me 
Move me when I'm home
Sometimes baby I awake in the night
I reach out to touch you 
But I'm scared you might bite
A little emotion wouldn't be out of place
Wake up and love me put a smile on my face
Otis Redding said it best "try a little tenderness"
Aretha wanted more "Respect"
Give me just a little touch
That ain't really asking much
Your dog gets more attention than I do
Move me, move me, move me when I'm home
Come on and move me, move me, move me when I'm home
Sometimes I wonder if you'll miss me at all
Emotionally independent, as hard as a wall
You're so wrapped up in your own little world
Your old time religion is your lunch with the girls
When I'm standing next to you even in a crowd
I might as well be on another planet
Tell me what I've done to you to justify this ridicule
If it's over why don't we forget it
Move me, soothe me, move me, rock me 
Move me when I'm home
Why don't you move me, love me, move me, rock me
Move me when I'm home
Why don't you rock me, move me, love me, soothe me
Move me when I'm home
Why don't you rock me, rock me, move me, soothe me
Soothe me when I'm home
