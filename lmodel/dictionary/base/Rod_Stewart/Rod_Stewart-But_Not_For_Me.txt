<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="But_Not_For_Me">
Old Man Sunshine, listen, you,
Never tell me dreams come true,
Just try it, and I'll start a riot,
Oprah Winfrey don't you dare,
Ever tell me she will care,
I'm certain, it's the final curtain.
I never want to hear from any cheerful Pollyannas,
Who tell you fate supplies a mate, it's all bananas.
They're writing songs of love
But not for me
A lucky star's above
But not for me
With love to lead the way
I've found more clouds of gray
Than any Russian play
Could guarantee
I was a fool to fall
And get that way
Hi ho! Alas!
And also, lackaday!
Although I can't dismiss
The memory of her kiss
I guess
She's not for me
It all began so well
But what an end
This is the time
A fellow needs a friend
The climax of the plot
Should be a marriage knot
But there's
No knot for me
Although I can't dismiss
The memory of her kiss
I guess
