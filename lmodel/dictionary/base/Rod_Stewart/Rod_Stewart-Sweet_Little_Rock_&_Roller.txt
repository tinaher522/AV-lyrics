<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="Sweet_Little_Rock_&_Roller">
Nineteen years old and as sweet as she could be
All dressed up like a downtown Christmas tree
Dancin' and hummin' a rock 'n' roll melody
She's the daughter of a well respected man
Who taught her how to jerk and understand
Then she became a rock 'n' roll music fan
Sweet little rock 'n' roller, sweet little rock 'n' roller
Her daddy doesn't have to scold her 
Her partner can't hardly hold her
Because she never gets any older
Sweet little rock 'n' roller
Shoulda seen her eyes when the band began to play
And the famous singer sang and bowed away
When the stars were gone she screamed and yelled hurray
Ten thousand eyes were watchin' them leave the floor
Five thousand tongues are screaming out "More" and "More"
About fifteen hundred waiting outside the door
Sweet little rock 'n' roller, sweet little rock 'n' roller
Her daddy doesn't have to scold her 
Her partner can't hardly hold her
Because she never gets any older
Sweet little rock 'n' roller
