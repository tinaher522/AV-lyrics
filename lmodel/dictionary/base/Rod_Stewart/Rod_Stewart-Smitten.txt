<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="Smitten">
Who must I be for you to love me
Endlessly, hopelessly, like I, do you
And where do I touch, when I need to so much
In a rush, wish you trust like I do 
And I have tried to please her (oh, yeah)
Much to my demise
Please say somethin' to ease my mind
She gets quiet every time
Hello, allow me to introduce myself
I am smitten
And she couldn't care less
Hello, allow me to introduce myself
I am smitten
And she couldn't care less
Yeah, yeah
Tricked by her smile, she needs me for a while
And I yearn, in return I am burned
Confess, I'm a mess, and there ain't too much left
But if she asked for it I'd give it in a minute (ah, yeah)
And I have tried to please her (yes, I am)
Much to my demise
Please, please say somethin' to ease my achin' mind
She gets quiet every time
Every time
Hello, allow me to introduce myself
I am smitten
And she couldn't care less
Hello, allow me to introduce myself
I am smitten
And she couldn't care less (now listen)
I'm the one with quiet anger in oblivion
Tear tracks smear the smile on my face 
And I am deep in love
I'm in love, I'm in love, y'all
Hello, allow me to introduce myself
I am smitten
And she couldn't care less
Hello, allow me to introduce myself
I am smitten
And she couldn't care less
Hello, allow me to introduce myself
I am smitten
And she couldn't care less (care less, care less, care less) 
Hello, allow me to introduce myself
I am smitten
And she couldn't care less
Care less (oh, yes)
Hello, allow me to introduce myself
I am smitten
And she couldn't care less
Yeah, she, she couldn't care less
She couldn't care less
There ain't nothin' I can do about it
No, no, no, no, no
There ain't nothin' I can do about it
