<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="Mopper's_Blues">
I got the mopper's blues
I got the mopper's blues
I got the mopper's blues
I got the mopper's blues
I got the mopper's blues
I'm the happiest man in town
Alright
I feel so good
I feel so good
I feel so good
Lord, I feel so good
I feel so good
I'm the happiest man in town
I got the mopper's blues
I got the mopper's blues
I got the mopper's blues
I got the mopper's blues
I got the mopper's blues
I'm the happiest man in town, yeah
I feel so good
I feel so good
I feel so good
Lord, I feel so good
I feel so good
I'm the happiest man in town
I ain't got no home
I ain't got no home
I ain't got no home
I ain't got no home
I ain't got no home
I'm the happiest man in town
