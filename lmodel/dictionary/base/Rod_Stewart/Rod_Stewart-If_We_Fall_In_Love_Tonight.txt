<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="If_We_Fall_In_Love_Tonight">
Pain, flows like a river, just keeps on livin' 
With all them memories
Shame, you're so heartbroken 
Now you're scared to open and give your love again
And now anticipation waits for love 
Will it be everything you dreamed this time around 
I know you have your doubts 
But I won't let you down
Darlin' if, if we fall in love tonight 
You're gonna be alright 
Your heart is in good hands
Darlin' if, if we fall in love again 
On me you can depend, if you could take a chance
Open your heart and let love, love again
Blame, who's fault is it this time 
I can see it in your eyes, I know you're wonderin'
Things can change, say you'll be all mine 
I'm gonna love you all the time
Don't let it slip away
And now anticipation waits for love 
Will it be everything you dreamed this time around 
I know you've got your doubts 
But honey I won't let you down
Darlin' if, if we fall in love tonight 
You're gonna be alright 
Your heart is in good hands
Darlin' if, if we fell in love again 
On me you can depend, if you can take a chance
And open your heart and let love, love again
Honey I don't, I don't want you to have any doubts about me
Whatever makes you happy, I'm gonna do
Baby I'm so ready to love you down
I can't wait another moment I need you right now
Darlin' if, if we fall in love tonight 
You're gonna be alright 
Your heart is in good hands
Darlin' if, if we fall in love again 
On me you can depend, if you can take a chance
Darlin' if, if we fall in love tonight 
You're gonna be alright 
Your heart is in good hands
Darlin' if, if we fall in love again 
On me you can depend, if you can take a chance
Open your heart and let love, love again
