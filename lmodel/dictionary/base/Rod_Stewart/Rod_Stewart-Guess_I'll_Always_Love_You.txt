<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="Guess_I'll_Always_Love_You">
I used to think I was somethin' real special, 
Brag about the hearts that I broke.
But you came along like a hurricane, honey.
And snapped me like a piece of rope.
Oh and even after all this time, 
When I've acted so stupid and blind.
You took me in when I was out.
You gave me hope when there was doubt.
I guess I'll always love you,
I guess I'll always care.
I guess I'll always love you,
All of my life.
I used to worry about time and money,
But I don't bother no more.
I used to belive I was an no time lover.
But now I'm no longer sure.
Oh, cause you've come into my life.
As tough as nails, been as sharp as a knife.
And if I ever get loose again.
You'll wrap me up and tuck me in.
You know what!
I guess I'll always love you,
I guess I'll always care.
I guess I'll always love you,
All of my life.
I feel I've waited a million years,
For this little girl of mine.
And this time I won't mess it up,
Stand by her for the rest of my life.
All of my life, all of my life.
All of my life, all of my life.
Ooooh.
Just a minute.
Wooh!
If I never get drunk again,
You're the one that takes the blame.
You know why baby?
I guess I'll always love you,
I guess I'll always care.
I guess I'll always love you,
All of my life.
One more.
All the times I've been too juiced up
You reminded me of my name 
And all the days that I went missing,
Ya kindly shared in the blame
Oh,but you've never seemed appalled
You'd even managed to laugh at it all
And I know you knew all along
I kiss the ground you're on
Wooh!
I guess I'll always love you,
I guess I'll always care.
I guess I'll always love ya,
All of my life.
Yeah!
I guess I'll always love you,
I guess I'll always care.
I guess I'll always love ya,
All of my life.
All of my life, all of my life,
All all of my life,
I been waiting for someone, someone like you.
