<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="Donkey_Rides,_A_Penny_Glass">
I like wasting my days in a caravan,
I liked my Uncle Joe,
What a lovely man!
Well, I love things,
I do my best,
I eat, sleep, laugh and cry just like the rest,
What becomes of me,
Is meant to be,
So I'll just groove along quite naturally, yeah.
Summers here and I'll be hiding my time away,
Looking for someone who'll tell me the time of day,
And he'll make your wish for true come,
Unexpected attacks on your nose,
Can be treated by touching your toes,
Donkey rides a penny a glass.
