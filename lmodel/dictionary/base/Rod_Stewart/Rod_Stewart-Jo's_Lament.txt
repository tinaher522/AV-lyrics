<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="Jo's_Lament">
I stayed away so long Jo
don't think that I could come back
You're doin' so well without me girl
you'd laugh if you'd know'd where I'm at
You knew me when it was all my world
Somehow it's all passed me by
But don't let on to my friends Jo dear
that things ain't turned out as planned
You bore my child then I left you aside
I don't expect you to forgive
But Jo I can say in a funny old way
I was sure that I had it made
I still possess a photograph
my memory to refresh
But fade it may Jo I can say
I was sure that I had it made
You bore my child then I left you aside
I don't expect you to forgive
But now I'm not so young and I'm so afraid
to sleep alone for the rest of my days
