<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="I_Can_Feel_The_Fire">
I can feel the fya
I can feel the fya - oh yeah
I can feel the fya - burnin'
I can feel the fya - burnin'
I can see you by my side
Picture you here by my side
I can feel the fya - buzzin'
I can feel the fya - ragin' up inside
I can feel the fya - burnin' oh yeah
I can feel the fya - burnin' burnin'
I can hear you calling me
Prettiest girl that I've ever seen
I can see you in the alley
(whatcha doinÃ?Â' down there baby)
I can feel you in the alley
(got ya uppa my mind)
I think I can hear you in the alley
I can see you by my side
Gimmie a chance to slip inside
I can feel the fya...
