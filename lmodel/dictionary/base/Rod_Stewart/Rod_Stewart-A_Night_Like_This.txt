<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="A_Night_Like_This">
Sixteen years old, looking for a hideaway
I'm a set designer, my Mum and Dad think that I'm gay
I'm a lazy bugger, but I like my sport
Like girls and music, I'm happy, happy sort of a guy
But there's one thing I'm lacking, it's sexual experience
So I ask you, my sweetheart; save me from this wilderness
I've dreamed, honey, of a night like this
Where I come from, love is just a hole in the wall
And the steel mills ring out and generations heed the call
And the rain never stops and the skies are grey
And the chance of romance slim as a bright sunny day
This is partly the reason; I'm so overwhelmed and shy
Because your beauty, by contrast is gonna make a young man cry
I've dreamed, honey, of a night like this
I've schemed, honey, of a night like this
You don't know what it means to a boy from a suburban home
To be left with a woman like you completely alone
I've dreamed, honey, of a night like this
Nice place you've got here, babe, never seen a house like this
Pool like an ocean, bed like a football pitch
All the guys at the boozer, won't believe my luck
But it couldn't have happened to a nicer bloke than me
So here we are, the record's gotten stuck in the groove
My knees are trembling, c'mon baby, make a move
I've dreamed, honey, of a night like this
I've schemed, honey, of a night like this
I've dreamed, I've schemed, honey, of a night like this
I've dreamed, honey, of a night like this
