<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="Love_And_Be_Loved">
There's a place that I know
Where the ocean is never cold
Happy people in clothes so pride
Where the sun in warm and wide oh yeah, oh yeah
Where the pounrty gentle sway
And the sky is never gray
All day long they sing the song
In simple words that roll along
Love and be loved
Oh singing now love and be loved
Love and be loved
Oh singing now love and be loved
On the beach at the coco bar
Little jimmy he plays guitar he says
All the riches you can posses
They never bring you happiness oh yeah, oh yeah
So reach out and help the man
Who's neck is down and needs a hand
Cause everything means nothing at all
If your heart is empty and cold
Love and be loved
Oh singing now love and be loved
Love and be loved
Oh singing now love and be loved
In a world divided by indifference
We must teach our children the meaning of commitment
Oh yeah
Slow down and take your time
Life can change and one slim die
What you give is what you get
So my friends never forget to
Love and be loved
Oh singing now love and be loved
Love and be loved
Oh singing now love and be loved
