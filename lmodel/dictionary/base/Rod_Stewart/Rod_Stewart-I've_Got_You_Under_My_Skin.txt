<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="I've_Got_You_Under_My_Skin">
I've got you under my skin
I've got you deep in the heart of me
So deep in my heart that you're really a part of me
I've got you under my skin
I tried so not to give in
I said to myself this affair never will go so well
But why should I try to resist when, baby, I will know so well
That I got you under my skin?
I'd sacrifice anything, come what may
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of a warning voice that comes in the night
And repeats, repeats in my ear
Don't you know, you fool, you never can win?
Use your mentality, wake up to reality
But each time I do, just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
'Cause I've got you under my skin
I'd sacrifice anything, come what may
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of that warning voice that comes in the night
And repeats, it repeats in my ear
Don't you know, you fool, you never can win?
Use your mentality, step up, wake up to reality
But each time I do, just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
'Cause I've got you under my skin
Yeah, I got you, pretty baby, under my skin
Yes, I got you, got you, I got you under my skin
Oh, I got you under, under my skin
