<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="Bring_It_On_Home_To_Me-You_Send_Me">
Well if you ever want to come home to me 
I'll still be here waiting
If you ever change your mind 
About leaving, leaving me behind
Baby bring it to me, bring your sweet loving 
Bring it on home to me
I know I laughed when you left 
But now I know that I only hurt myself
Honey bring it to me, bring your sweet loving 
Bring it on home to me
Let me tell you all about it
I'll give you tulips and money too 
That ain't all, that ain't all I'd do for you
If you'll bring it to me, bring you're sweet loving
Bring it on home to me
You know I'll always be your slave 
Until I'm buried, buried in my grave
Oh honey bring it to me, bring your sweet loving 
Bring it on home to me
I tried to treat you right 
But you stayed out, stayed out late at night 
But I forgive you
Bring it to me, bring your sweet loving 
Bring it on home to me
Just remember this one thing darlin' that
You, you, you send me, you know this one 
You, you know darlin' you send me 
And I know that you, you thrill me
Honest you do, honest you do, honest you do 
And I wanna tell you one thing that
And I know this one thing that
You send me honest you do, honest you do 
Honest you do, let me tell you
When I get home you're always there for me
And I know that you're gonna send me
Honest you do, honest you do, honest you do 
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
Well you thrill me
Darlin' you're always gonna send me
