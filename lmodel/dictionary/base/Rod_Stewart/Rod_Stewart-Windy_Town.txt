<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="Windy_Town">
Driving down 
From the Highland Line 
We'd done some gigs 
On the Clyde of the Tyne 
They flew us in 
From a Hamburg strip 
The taste of Dusseldorf 
Still on our lips 
And on the bus 
There's a friend of mine 
We go way back 
To the scene of the crime 
Sit up front 
And share a cigarette 
And try to remember 
What we tried to forget 
He said, "do you remember" 
He said, "do you recall" 
I said, "Yeah I remember 
Oh I remember it all" 
Everytime the cold wind blows 
Everytime I hear the sound 
Late night trains 
Shuntin' down by the river 
I remember Windy Town 
We've come so far 
And we moved so fast 
Makin' haste 
See it all grow past 
Round the world 
And around again 
Up and down 
On that gravy train 
Everytime the cold wind blows 
Everytime I hear the sound 
East coast crosswinds 
On the cold wet stone 
I remember Windy Town 
I've seen it all before 
The freezing corners 
And the empty streets 
The burning passion 
And the cold wet feet 
Three tricky miles home every night 
Dodging from the shadows 
Underneath the overlights 
Nocard for kissin' 
And nowhere to go 
'Cept inside each other 
And I love you so 
I held your face 
As you shivered in the rain 
Girl, I'll love you again 
Oh everytime, yeah everytime 
Everytime the cold wind blows 
Everytime I hear the sound 
Late night trains 
Shuntin' down by the river 
I remember Windy Town 
Everytime the cold wind blows 
Everytime I hear the sound 
East coast crosswinds 
On the cold wet stone 
I remember Windy Town 
There it goes, there it goes 
Windy Town
