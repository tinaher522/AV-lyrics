<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="To_Love_Somebody">
There's a light,
A certain kind of light
That never shone on me.
I want my life to be, lived with you.
Lived with you.
And there's a way, ev'rybody says,
To do each and ev'ry little thing.
But what good does it mean
If I ain't got you, if ain't got you?
'Cause you don't know what it's like
You don't know what it's like 
To love somebody, 
To love somebody 
The way I love you.
In my brains
I see your face again;
I know my frame of mind
You ain't got to be so blind
I'm blind, so very very blind
I'm a man, 
Can't you see what I am?
I live and breath for you
But what good does this  do 
If he ain't got you, if he ain't got you?
'cause you don't know what it's like, baby,
You don't know what it's like 
To love somebody, 
To love somebody 
The way I love you
'cause you don't know what it's like, baby,
You don't know what it's like 
To love somebody, 
To love somebody 
The way I love you
Ooh yeah
Ooh yeah
Oh baby
You don't know what it's like
You never never know what it's like
To love somebody, 
To love somebody 
The way I love you,
