<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="Love_Wars">
Love wars, love wars
Absence makes the heart grow fonder
But it's taking me under
Since you're not here, oh baby
Its better when it's harder to get
But this hide and go seek
Well it's making me weep, yeah
(oh we call over now baby)
I promise you to stop boxing you round
So don't scratch my face now
At the end of the eight
We need to get our act together
Take it off the street
Bring it on home and drop them guns on the floor
Stop them
Love wars (no, we don't need no)
Love wars, ha
Talks we had just don't change a thing
They only bring rain
On top of pain, it's hurts me
Flashbacks and uncover tracks
From when you left me
With my best friend,
Oh you left me all alone baby
(so sorry babe) hurts so bad
We need to get our act together
Take it off the street
Bring it on home and drop them guns on the floor
Make love in peace
And baby never cheat
Vow to be strong and let the band roll on
No more love wars (we don't need no)
Love wars
Love wars we don't want no
Love wars (I don't want no)
Love wars
We don't need no love wars
Get it off the street (love wars)
We don't need no (no more, no more)
Love wars
Absence makes the heart grow fonder
But it's taking me under
Since you're not here, oh baby (oh baby)
I remember losing my head
And calling you things
Like dirty names oh I had (	   ) enough (yes you did, boy)
We need to get our act together
And get if off the street
Bring it on home and drop them guns on the floor, yeah
Make love in peace
And baby ever cheat
Vow to be strong and let the band roll on
Stop them
Love wars (we don't need no)
Love wars
Love wars, we don't need no
Love wars (I don't want no love wars)
I don't need no, need no (love wars, I don't want no)
Love wars (talk to me, boy)
Love wars, ha
(wanna talk about it)
There'll be nothing for us (	   ) between
(talk to me we don't need we don't want no)
