<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="Ten_Days_Of_Rain">
The wind cries on the boardwalk
Oh God, it's cold tonight
Somewhere in the city
Someone's holding her tight
He's telling her she's beautiful
Touching her long blond hair
He's found out all the secrets
We swore we'd never share
Oh, it drives me crazy
To think of her with him
Come back, baby
Come back home again
Ten days of rain
Ten days of rain
My heart is filled with pain
Will she ever come back again?
Ten days of rain
She said I'm tired of talking
Trying to get it through to you
You never tell me you love me
That's all I want you to do
I thought we had a future
Something to hold on to
We even talked of children
Something I never do
She loved me like no other
She held me like a child
Come back baby, come back home again
Ten days of rain
Ten days of rain
My heart is filled with pain
Will she ever come back again?
Ten days of rain
The thought of her still haunts me
Her voice is everywhere
Ten days of rain
Ten days of rain
I can hear the freight train whistle
I can hear the church bells toll
But telephone line, when it's off the hook
That's the loneliest sound of 'em all
In the letter that she wrote me
Before she went away
She said darling, always remember
Love ain't a hard word to say
Ten days of rain
Ten days of rain, such pain
Will she ever come back again
I don't know, I don't know
Come back baby, I'm so lonely baby
Ten days of rain, ten days of rain
Is it raining all, raining all
Raining all over this world
