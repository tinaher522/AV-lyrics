<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="That_Old_Black_Magic">
That old black magic has me in its spell
That old black magic that you weave so well
Icy fingers up and down my spine
That same old witchcraft when your eyes meet mine.
That same old tingle that I feel inside
When that elevator starts its ride
‘Round and ‘round I go, up and down I go
Like a leaf that's caught in the tide.
I should stay away but what can I do ?
I hear your name and I'm aflame
A flame with such a burning desire
That only your kiss, kiss, kiss can put out the fire.
You’re the lover that I've waited for
The mate that fate had me created for
And every time your lips meet mine
Baby, ‘round and ‘round I go, up and down I go
In a spin, I’m loving that spin that I'm in
Under that old black magic called love.
I should stay away but what can I do ?
I hear your name and I'm aflame
A flame with such a burning desire
That only your kiss, kiss, kiss can put out the fire.
You’re the lover that I've waited for
The mate that fate had me created for
And every time your lips meet mine
Baby, ‘round and ‘round I go, up and down I go
In a spin, I’m loving that spin that I'm in
Under that old black magic called love.
I should stay away but what can I do ?
I should stay away but what can I do ?
I should stay away
I should stay away but what can I do ?
