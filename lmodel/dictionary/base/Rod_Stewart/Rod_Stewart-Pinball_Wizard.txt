<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="Pinball_Wizard">
Ever since I was a young boy,
I played the silver ball;
From Soho down to Brighton
I must have played 'em all.
But I ain't seen nothin' like him
In any amusement hall
That deaf, dumb an' blind kid
Sure plays a mean pinball.
He stands like a statue,
Becomes part of the machine.
Feelin' all the bumpers
Always playin' clean.
Plays by intuition,
The digit counters fall.
That deaf, dumb an' blind kid
Sure plays a mean pinball!
He's a pinball wizard
There has to be a twist,
A pinball wizard,
Got such a supple wrist.
How do you think he does it?
What makes him so good?
Ain't got no distractions,
Can't hear those buzzes and bells,
Don't see lights aflashin'
Plays by sense of smell.
Always gets a replay,
Never tilts at all
That deaf, dumb an' blind kid
Sure plays a mean pinball.
Even my usual table,
He can beat my best,
His disciples lead him in
And he just does the rest.
He's got crazy flipper' fingers,
Never seen him fall.
That deaf, dumb and blind kid
Sure plays a mean pinball.
