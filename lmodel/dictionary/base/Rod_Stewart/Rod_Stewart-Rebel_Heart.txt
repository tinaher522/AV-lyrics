<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="Rebel_Heart">
I picked her up about a quarter to nine
My brother told me I was wasting my time
A woman like that'll only cause you confusion
but go ahead you may find it amusing
She came to the door wearing a suit and tie
her hair cropped short I couldn't figure out why
Rebel heart don't be a loner
Rebel heart I'm your lover
Rebel heart I wanna discover
where you from and where you belong 
and everything that turns you on
I wanted to dance but she flatly refused
I told her jokes but she was not amused
Tried to kiss her but she wouldn't stand still
Started thinking this was overkill
Next thing I know I was flyin' for cover
it was her steady girlfriend and a live-in lover
Rebel heart why don't you try it
Rebel heart you can't deny it
Rebel heart you may like it
I'll change your mind if you'll give me time
about everything that's on your mind
I stayed awake all last night fantasizing about you baby
You know I'd walk a million miles across broken glass
or a red hot Arabian desert
if I could just have one night in your long brass bed
Evening wound up on a very sad note
I drove her home and then she went for my throat
She said, "it's fairly obvious I ain't attracted to you
You bore me to tears honest you do
And by the way I can't stand your British"
I said, "don't start something, honey, you know you can't finish"
Rebel heart I won't forget ya
Rebel heart I'm glad I met ya
Rebel heart give me an answer
where you're from and where you belong
and everything that turns you on
You came, you saw, you conquered me
When you did that to me I knew that it had to be
I'd lift you up with my own arms honey
I can't get enough
I'd walk down Fifth Avenue entirely naked
I promise I won't drink, swear, womanize
I'd go to church every Sunday 
for just one night with you
Rebel heart I'm your lover
Rebel heart I wanna discover
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Rebel heart I won't forget ya
Rebel heart I'm glad I met ya
Rebel heart give me an answer
Oh yeah oh yeah
Rebel heart I won't forget ya
Rebel heart give me an answer
Oh yeah oh yeah
