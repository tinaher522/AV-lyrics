<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="Careless_With_Our_Love">
Wake up, little darling, it's time to go home
Sunrise catch you sleeping
We'll be caught up in the round
Last time we were together we made it home just in the nick of time
So much love between us
It's getting hard to meet a deadline
We're getting careless with our love
We're getting careless with our love
So careless with our love affair
Wake up, little darling, cause time won't stand still
Growing old with the one you all love, I know it's against your will
Oh, I hate to see you leave with tears all over your face
But just how should I count?
The whole world is on your case
We're getting careless with our love
So careless with our love affair
Some people say that it's wrong
(Do you really care what people say?)
But it's the only love me know and it keeps on getting stronger
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh… 
Oh yeah!
Each time we see each other it keeps on getting stronger
Oh, I hate to see you leave
I want to hold you a little longer
We're getting careless with our love
We're getting careless with our love
So careless with our love affair
We're getting careless with our love
So careless with our love
We're getting careless with our love affair
If loving you is wrong, I don't what to be right
If being right means being without you, I'd rather live a wrong doing life
We're so careless…
(With our love)
We're so careless…
(With our love)
We're getting careless with our love affair
We're getting careless with our love
So careless with this love, right
We're getting careless with this love affair
So careless with our love
So, so careless with our love
(Careless with our love affair).
