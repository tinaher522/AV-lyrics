[A very good morning to you,
You are listening to Radio K.N.O.B. FM in New York City.
Gorgeous weather-wise this Saturday morning with a high of 86 degrees throughout Brooklyn and the Bronx,
and it's going to be a beautiful weekend]
Saturday morning the sky is shining,
I'm walking down the avenue,
I'm a little hungover from the night before, 
Dancing with my girl 'til 2,
I've got the key to her apartment gonna let myself in,
Trying to make a lovely surprise,
Well it's a tricky situation,
Gotta keep quiet or I'll get a punch in my eye
Wake up you sleepy head, get up get out of bed,
It's gonna be a great day,
Put on your polkadot, show 'em just what you got, 
It's gonna be a great day
Yes it is, come on now
Temperatures rising, people are smiling as the parade marches down the street,
A calypso bands playing, everyone's swaying, and memories are made of this,
Wake up you sleepy head, get up get out of bed, 
It's gonna be a great day,
Let's go down to the square,
All of our friends are there, 
It's gonna be a great day,
Yes it is,
It's gonna be a great day,
It's gonna be a great day.
Watch this
Woohoo
Oh yeah
One, two, three, yes
Slippin' and slidin', lovin' and laughin', ain't these peculiar times,
The sun is shining, there's no denying, the best days of our lives
Wake up you sleepy head, get up get out of bed, 
It's gonna be a great day
Think now the weekends here,
Maybe we'll grab a beer, 
It's gonna be a great day
Great day.
It's gonna be a great day,
It's gonna be a great day.
