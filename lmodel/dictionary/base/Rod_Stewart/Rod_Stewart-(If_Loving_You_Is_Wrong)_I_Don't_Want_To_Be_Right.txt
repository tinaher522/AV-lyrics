<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="(If_Loving_You_Is_Wrong)_I_Don't_Want_To_Be_Right">
If loving you is wrong
I don't wanna be right
If being right means being without you
I'd rather live a wrong doing life
Your mama and daddy say it's a shame
It's a downright disgrace
Long as I got you by my side
I don't care what your people say
Your friends tell you
There's no future in loving a married man
If I can't see you when I want to 
I'll see you when I can
If loving you is wrong
I don't wanna be right
If loving you is wrong
I don't wanna be right
Am I wrong to fall
So deeply in love with you?
Knowing I got a wife and two little children
Depending on me too?
And am I wrong to hunger
For the gentleness of your touch?
Knowing I got somebody else at home
Who needs me just as much?
And are you wrong to fall in love
With a married man?
And am I wrong trying to hold on
To the best thing I ever had?
If loving you is wrong
I don't wanna be right
If loving you is wrong
I don't wanna be right
Are you wrong to give your love
To a married man?
And am I wrong trying to hold on
To the best thing I ever had?
If loving you is wrong
I don't wanna be right
If loving you is wrong
I don't wanna be right
I don't wanna be right
If it means sleeping alone at night
I don't wanna be right
If it means coming home at night
I don't wanna
I don't wanna
I don't wanna never, never, never be right
