Standing in the shadows of love
I'm getting ready for the heartaches to come
Standing in the shadows of love
I'm just waitin' for the heartaches to come
I want to run but there's no place to go
'cause heartaches will follow me I know
Without your love the love I need
It's the beginning of the end for me
'cause you've taking away all my reason for living
When you pushed aside all the love I been giving
Didn't I treat you right now baby didn't i
Didn't I do the best for you now didn't i
Don't you leave me
Standing in the shadows of love
I'm getting ready for the heartaches to come
Standing in the shadows of love
I'm getting ready for the heartaches to come
All alone I'm destined to be
With misery my only company
Might come today, might come tomorrow
But it's for sure I ain't got nothing but sorrow
Now don't your conscience kind of bother you
How can you watch me cry after all I done for you
Now hold on a minute
Didn't I treat you right now honey didn't i
Didn't I do the best for you now didn't i
So don't you leave me
Standing in the shadows of love
Getting ready for the heartaches to come
Standing in the shadows of love
I'm getting ready for the heartaches to come
I want to run but there's no place to go
'cause heartaches will follow me I know
Without your love the love that I need
It's the beginning of the end for me
Now don't your conscience kinda, kinda bother you
How can you watch me cry
After all the things I done for you
Didn't I treat you right now baby didn't i
Didn't I do the best for you couldn't i
Didn't I do right by you didn't i
Didn't I screw you right now
Kept you in luxury didn't i
Didn't I do the best for you didn't i
Didn't I treat you right now didn't i
Didn't I do the best for you now didn't i
I'm trying hard not to cry
You know my crying ain't gonna help me now
Without your love the love that I need
It's the beginning of the end for me
So don't you leave me
Standing in the shadows of love
I'm getting ready for the heartaches to come
Standing in the shadows of love
I'm getting ready for the heartaches to come
