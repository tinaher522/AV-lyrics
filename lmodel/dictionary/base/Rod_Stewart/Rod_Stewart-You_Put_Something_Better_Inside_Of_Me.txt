<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="You_Put_Something_Better_Inside_Of_Me">
I can look out my window 
Or stare at the wall 
It really didn't matter 
Na, I just didn't care at all 
Could be sitting by the water 
Counting every stone 
But nothing means nothing 
When your empty and on your own 
Cause you put something better 
Inside of me  
You put something better 
Inside of me 
Makes me so much stronger 
I'm amazed at the change in me 
Well I knew what I was doing 
I was running away 
Busy going nowhere 
Just wasting the time of day 
I was walking down the road 
Kicking at the stones 
Nothing means nothing 
When your empty and on your own 
Know why?
You put something better inside of me 
Makes me so much stronger 
I'm amazed at the change in me  
You put something better inside of me 
Makes me so much stronger 
I'm amazed at the change in me  
You made me so much stronger 
I'm amazed at the change in me  
Take me home
