<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="Memphis_Tennessee">
Long distance information
Give me Memphis Tennesee
Help me find the party
Trying to get in touch with me
She could not leave her number
But I know what place to call
Because my Uncle took the message
And he wrote it on the wall
Help me information
Get in touch with my Marie
She's the only one who'd phone me here
From Memphis Tennessee
Her house is on the south side
High upon the ridge
Just about a half a mile
From the Mississippi bridge
Last time I saw Marie
She was waving me goodbye
With hurry home drops on her cheeks
That trickeled from her eye
Marie is only six years old
Information please
Try to put me through to her
In Memphis Tennessee
