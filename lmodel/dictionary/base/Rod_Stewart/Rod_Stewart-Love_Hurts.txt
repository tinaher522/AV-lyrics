<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="Love_Hurts">
Love hurts, love scars
Love wounds and mars
Any heart not tough
Nor stong enough
To take a lot of pain
Take a lot of pain
Love is like a cloud
Holds a lot of rain
Love hurts
Oh-oh, love hurts
You're young, I know
But even so
I know a thing or two
I've learned from you
I really learned a lot
I've really learned a lot
Love is like a flame
It burns you when it's hot
Love hurts
Oh-oh, love hurts
Some fools think of happiness
Blissfulness, togetherness
Some fools fool themselves, I guess
But they're not foolin' me
I know it isn't true
I know it isn't true
Love is just a lie
Made to make you blue
Love hurts
Oh-oh, love hurts
I know it isn't true
I know it isn't true
Love is just a lie
Made to make you blue
Love hurts
Oh-oh, love hurts
Love hurts
Oh, love hurts, oh yeah
I know this one thing
I know it ain't true
Ooh-ooh, love hurts
Ooh-ooh, love hurts
Ooh-ooh, love hurts
