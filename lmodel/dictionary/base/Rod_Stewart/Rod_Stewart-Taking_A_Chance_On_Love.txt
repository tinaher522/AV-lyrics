<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="Taking_A_Chance_On_Love">
Here I go again
I hear those trumpets blow again
All aglow again
Taking a chance on love
Here I slide again
About to take that ride again
I'm starry eyed again
Taking a chance on love
I thought the cards were a frame-up
I never would try
But now I'm taking the game up
And the ace of hearts is high
All things are mending now
I see a rainbow blending now
We'll have a happy ending now
Taking a chance on love
Here I slip again
About to take that trip again
Got my grip again
Taking a chance on love
Now I prove again
That I can make life move again
In the groove again
Taking a chance on love
I walk around with a horseshoe
In clover I lie
And brother rabbit of course you
Better kiss your foot good-bye
On the ball again
I'm riding for a fall again
I'm gonna give my all again
Taking a chance on love
Taking a chance on love
