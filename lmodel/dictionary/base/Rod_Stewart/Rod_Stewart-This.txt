<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="This">
Down by law, on Baker Street 
Lay your head back on, this field of dreams 
Then close your eyes 
There's a few that, find love 
On Sundays down by the sea 
And they wash clean, like angels 
(And they wash clean like angel's wings) 
High above the waves so free 
I have no words to say to you 
I have no dream to take you to 
I have no ring for you to kiss 
Baby, all I have is this 
Pray for grace, keep the faith 
Walk on down the road 
Wait for me, look for love 
Are you fearless? Reckless? 
Homeless and all alone? 
Can you make love, heal things? 
Make my heart go wild again? 
I have no words to say to you 
I have no dream to take you to 
I have no ring for you to kiss 
Baby, all I have is this 
And she says it doesn't matter anymore 
There's a few that, find love 
On Sundays down by the sea 
And they wash clean, like angels 
(And they wash clean like angel's wings) 
High above the waves so free 
I have no words to say to you 
I have no dream to take you to 
I have no ring for you to kiss 
Baby, all I have is this 
All I have is on my sleeve 
All I want is your sweet love, baby 
All I saw was open space 
Walk down the road, fearless, fearless 
All I have is this
