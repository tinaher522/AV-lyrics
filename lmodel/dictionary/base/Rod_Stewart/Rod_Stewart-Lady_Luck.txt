<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="Lady_Luck">
Lady luck here I am on time
Propping up the bar with a glass of wine
Friday night and I'm all spruced up and fine
And I ain't going nowhere
Lady Luck why don't you pull up a chair
And bring your shamrock wisdom darling over here
Your Gaelic humor and your pious smile
All the cats will be laughing tonight
Now you may say it's a funny old world
You may say that the game ain't fair
Is there a plot or do you improvise
Or maybe you don't even care
Lady luck, ain't you the fickle kind
Why some folks lucky while the rest die trying
Your divine plan is still a mystery
Laced with a touch of inconsistency
So why don't you give us all a break
Make us all rich healthy and fine
Five month holidays a 4-hour week
And a horse that wins all the time
Lady Luck hear the mandolins
Kinda makes you wonder how it might have been
There go I but for the grace of God
Back on the streets again
Lady Luck yeah it's late I know
Allow me to buy you one more for the road
Tell me something I've been longing to hear
It's gonna get better next year
'Cause I've seen some rainy days
My wedding suits are frayed and torn
But now the sun comes shining through
I've cried in my beer too long
Lady Luck it sure is a funny old world
Sure is a funny old world
