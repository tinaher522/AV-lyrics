<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="Try_A_Little_Tenderness">
Oh she may be weary
Young girls they do got weary
Wearing that same old shabby dress
Yeah yeah yeah
But when she gets weary
Try a little tenderness
Oh yeah, that's all you gotta do
You know she's there waiting
Just anticipating
Things that she'll never, never possess
No no no
But while she's there waiting
Try a little tenderness
It's not just sentimental, no no no no
She has her grief and cares
But the soft words
That are spoke so gently, yeah
It makes it easier, easier to bear
You won't regret it
Young girls they don't forget it
Love is their only happiness
Yeah yeah yeah
Its so so easy
Try a little tenderness
You know what I mean
But the soft words
They are spoken so gently, yeah, yeah
It makes it easier, easier to bear
She may be weary
young girls they do got weary
Wearing that same old shabby dress
Yeah yeah yeah
But when she gets weary
Try a little tenderness
Yeah, a little tenderness
That's all you've gotta do
Listen to me
Try, try, try, try
One time for the last time
A little bit of tenderness
tenderness, tenderness
Ooh, need you, I love you
I want you tonight, love me, baby
A little bit of tenderness
