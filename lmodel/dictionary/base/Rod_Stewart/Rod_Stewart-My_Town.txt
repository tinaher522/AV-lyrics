<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="My_Town">
[Chorus]
Bring the wind to carry me over
Lead me home to my town
Tell me when that breeze is blowin'
Takin' me home to my town
When I think of you scotia
There's a love that just bleeds in my heart
In my childhood days, we went our different ways
But you knew that we'd never part
Now I'm all alone
And your calling me home
You knew our love could never die
And though my roaming eyes always lead me astray
Well I'm coming back home
Scotia don't walk away
[Chorus]
So when I think of you scotia
There's a magic that fills the air
We're the downtown boys
Making all that noise
Oh we live like we just don't care
So we drank our fill
For king and country
Yeah til the last soldier fell
Berlington Bertie, your in my heart forever
I want to drown in the stories you tell
[Chorus]
Oh to my town
You make me owe
I can't ever be
If I should fall
Your love will rescue me
[Chorus]
Bring the wind to carry me over (carry me over)
Lead me home to my town (to my town)
Tell me when that breeze is blowin'
Takin' me home to my town
Oh oh oh oh
Carry me over
Lead me home to my town (to my town)
Tell me when that breeze is blowin'
Takin' me home to my town
[Chorus]
