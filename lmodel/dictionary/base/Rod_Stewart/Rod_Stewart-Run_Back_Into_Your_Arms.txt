<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="Run_Back_Into_Your_Arms">
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh, ooh (ooh, ooh)
No matter how long it takes, baby
It would never be a day too long
All the mistakes I made 
And the games that I played
Didn't know I was needin' you so bad
But I never thought that I would feel so lonely
And I never thought that I would feel so sad
I wanna run back into your arms tonight
I want you back here where you belong
I wanna take back all of those lies I told
I was wrong, so wrong
And now you're gone
Oh, yeah
Now you're gone
Just give me another chance, baby
To show you how much I really care
All that I put you through
I never knew
Didn't know I was makin' you so sad
Baby, now that you have given me a reason
And the time has come for me to understand
I wanna run back into your arms tonight
I want you back here where you belong
I wanna take back all of those lies I told
I was wrong, so wrong
And now you're gone
Now you're gone
Ooh, ooh
But you never miss the water till the well runs dry 
But ya left me cold and lonely 
And I know the reason why
I wanna run back into your arms tonight
I want you back here where you belong
I wanna take back all of those lies I told
I was wrong, so wrong
And now you're gone
Now you're gone
And now you're gone
All alone
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
I miss you, baby
I wanna run back to your arms 
Sometime
Yeah, hey, babe
And now you're gone 
Now you're gone
And now you're gone
