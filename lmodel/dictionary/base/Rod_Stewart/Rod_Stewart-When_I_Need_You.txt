<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="When_I_Need_You">
When I need you
I just close my eyes and I'm with you
And all that I so want to give you
It's only a heartbeat away
When I need love
I hold out my hand
And I touch love
I never knew there was so much love
Keeping me warm night and day
Miles and miles of empty space in between us
A telephone can't take the place of your smile
But you know I won't be travellin' forever
It's cold out
But hold out
And do like I do
When I need you
I just close my eyes and I'm with you
And all that I so want to give you babe
It's only a heartbeat away
It's not easy when the road is your driver
Honey that's a heavy load that we bear
But you know I won't be travellin' a lifetime
It's cold out
So hold out
And do like I do
When I need you
When I need love
I hold out my hands
And I touch love
I never knew there was so much love
Keeping me warm night and day
When I need you
I just close my eyes and you're right here by my side
Keepin' me warm night and day
I just hold out my hands
I just hold out my hands
And I'm with you darlin'
Yes I'm with you darlin'
All I wanna give you
It's only a heartbeat away
Oh I need you darlin'
