<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="Say_It_Ain't_True">
Look at all the problems 
That we've been through
How can you tell me 
That there's somebody new
I don't believe that I'm hearing this
I don't really think that you're serious
Well you picked a fine time to hesitate
See it my way I've nothing left
You can take my heart but don't steal my pride
Think it over before I'm pushed aside 
And tell me
Say it ain't true 
That's all you gotta do, baby
Say it ain't true
Well I thought this one was bound to last
Together forever oh what a laugh
It's going to hurt when I set you free
I've been loving you too long 
You're a part of me
So tell me
Say it ain't true, Tell me baby
Say it ain't true
Put yourself in my place for a little while
Going out of fashion growing out of style
No one to laugh with nobody to share
No one to lean on nobody to care
Nothing left but a memory
I gave you my heart so stay with me 
And tell me
Say it ain't true
Say it ain't true 
Tell me baby
Say it ain't true
I love you baby
I love you baby
I just want to do right by you honey
Wouldn't do you no wrong
