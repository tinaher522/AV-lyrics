<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="Rainy_Night_In_Georgia">
Hoverin' by my suitcase, tryin' to find a warm place to spend the night
Heavy rain fallin', seems I hear your voice callin'Â : 'It's all right'.
A rainy night in Georgia, such a rainy night in Georgia
It seems like it's rainin' all over the world
And I feel like it's rainin' all over the world.
Neon signs a-flashin', taxi cabs and buses passin' through the night
A distant moanin' of a train seems to play a sad refrain to the night.
A rainy night in Georgia, such a rainy night in Georgia
Lord, I believe it's rainin' all over this world
I feel like it's rainin' all over the world.
How many times I wondered
It still comes out the same
No matter how you look at it or think of it
It's life and you just got to play the game.
I find me a place in a box car so I take my guitar to pass some time
Late at night when it's hard to rest I hold your picture to my chest and I feel fine.
But it's a rainy night in Georgia, baby, it's a rainy night in Georgia
I feel like it's rainin' all over the world, kinda lonely now 'cause it's rainin' all over the world.
Yes, it's rainin', rainin', rainin', oh yeah.
It's rainin', rainin', rainin' all over the world.
