<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="When_You_Wish_Upon_A_Star">
When you wish upon a star
Makes no difference who you are
Anything your heart desires
Will come to you
If your heart is in your dreams
No request is to extreme
When you wish upon a star
As dreamers do
Fate is kind
She brings to those who love
The sweet fulfillment of their secret longing
Like a bolt out of the blue
Fate steps in and sees you through
When you wished upon a star
Your dreams come true
If your heart is in your dreams
No request is to extreme
When you wish upon a star
As dreamers do
When you wish upon a star
Your dream comes true
