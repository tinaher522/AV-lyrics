<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="You_Belong_To_Me">
See the pyramids along the Nile
Watch the sun rise on a tropic isle
Just remember darling all the while
You belong to me
See the marketplace in Old Algiers
Send me photographs and souvenirs
But just remember when a dream appears
You belong to me
I'll be so alone without you
Maybe you'll be lonesome too and kind of blue
Fly the ocean in a silver plane
See the jungle when it's wet with rain
But just remember til you're home again
You belong to me
I'll be so alone without you
Maybe you'll be lonesome too and so blue
Fly the ocean in a silver plane
See the jungle when it's wet with rain
But just remember til you're home again
You belong to me
But just remember til you're home again
You belong to me
