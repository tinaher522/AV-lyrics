<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="Why_Does_It_Go_On?">
You know it ain't right to beat a man when he's down
Know it ain't right to eat when the hunger's around
It keeps on worryin' me, as all around I see
And still it goes on
Why does it go on ? 
Why does it go on ? 
You know it ain't right to take another man's life
You know it ain't right to take another man's wife
Keeps gettin' through to me, as everywhere I see
Why does it go on ? 
Why does it go on ? 
Why does it go on ? 
They don't want love today
It's headin' all the way
They'll burn your book and pencil boy
Throw your mind away
A man don't steal, but has to work for his pay
(let me tell you one thing)
A poker man deals from the top when he plays
But all good things we take
We don't build, we just break
Why does it go on ? 
Why does it go on ? 
Why does it go on ? 
They don't want love today
It's headin' all the way
They'll burn your book and pencil boy
Throw your mind away
A man don't steal, but has to work for his pay
(let me tell you one thing)
A poker man deals from the top when he plays
But all good things we take
We don't build, we just break
Why does it go on ? 
Why does it go on ? 
Why does it go on ?  yeah
