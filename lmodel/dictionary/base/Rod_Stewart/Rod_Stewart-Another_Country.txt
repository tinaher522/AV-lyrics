<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="Another_Country">
Every day I'm awake
I've been thinking about you
And I can't get you over my mind
You're the girl of my dreams
The mother of my children
I'm as proud as any man can be alive
As the wind blows heavy down the mountain side
And the darkness of night closes in
As I lie in my bed
I can hear your heart pounding
Far away in another country
Far away in another country
And I dream of the day
We'll be packing up and leaving
This God-forsaken corner of the world
All the boys getting taller?
Is your tummy getting broader?
Do we know if it's a boy or it's a girl?
And I reach ouy to touch you in the middle of the night
And I swear you're lying next to me
But you're not, I'm awake
With my poor heart aching
Far away in another country
Far away in another country
One of these bright sunny days
I'll be coming down that road again
My journey had an end
God bless you until then
How I miss, how I miss
The colour of the springtime
And the moonlight shining through your hair
Say hello to my friends
And all of our kindred
Tell 'em I will soon be there
There's a tear in my eye as I try to sleep
Are the boys still calling out my name?
Tell 'em daddy's in a fight
Between good and evil
Far away in another country
Far away in another country
