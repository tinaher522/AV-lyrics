<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="Wonderful_World">
I don't know much about history
Don't know much biology
Don't know much about science book
Don't know much about the French I took
But I do know that I love you
And I want to give you love me too
What a wonderful world this would be.
I don't know much about geography
Don't know much trigonometry
Don't know much about algebra
Don't know what a slide rule is for
But I do know one and one is two
And I want to give you love me too
What a wonderful this would be
 
Now I don't claim to be an 'A' student
But I'm trying to be
But maybe by being an 'A' student, baby babe,
I could win your love for me.
I don't know much about history
Don't know much biology
Don't know much about science book
Don't know much about the French I took
But I know that I love you
And I want to give you love me too
What a wonderful world this would be.
All I know that I love you
And I want to give you love me too
What a wonderful world this would be.
Oh, cha cha cha ...
It's wonderful world  (history)
It's wonderful world  (biology)
It's wonderful world  (science book)
It's wonderful world  (French I took)
