<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="Alright_For_An_Hour">
Oh, didn't I mess around like ev'rybody did? 
I said, ' woman, you're foolin' around with a man that just don't fit.'
I said, 'i'd better get along before I get right under your skin.'
Remember the song, wasn't it fun, 'cause it was just one of those things.
But it was alright for an hour; it was alright for a day.
But it did not last, it did not last till the weekend,
And I packed my bags and moved right away.
I said goodbye to money, I don't owe no alimony.
I paid my dues and payroll cues, gonna leave it all up to you.
I'll take my dog and my car, the best friends I've found so far,
And I'll keep goin' with the mornin' sun, singin' the same old song.
But it was alright for an hour; it was alright for a day.
But it did not last, it did not last till the weekend,
And I packed my bags and moved right away.
Well I guess you needed somebody to open each and ev'ry door
With a large amount in the swiss account to give you thrills and nothing more.
But my volkswagen is hardly a custom built ferarri.
You want firstclass but I pump gas, so I'll get on out of your way.
But it was alright for an hour; it was alright for a day.
But it did not last, it did not last till the weekend,
And I packed my bags and moved right away.
It was alright for an hour; it was alright for a day.
But it did not last, it did not last till the weekend,
And I packed my bags and moved right away.
