<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="Shock_To_The_System">
Well she came from the motor city
From a clean white neighbor hood
She had a degree in social science
She came out here to hollywood
She's a six foot sultry beauty
With an eye for polynisian art
In a short shirt and doctor martens
She could kick start a dead mans heart
It's not what she say
It's all in her sway
Shes a shock to the system
It's not how she talk
It's all in her walk
It's a shock to the system
Shes a rough cut sacred diamond
In a sea of mediocre style
She just wants the pro shot body
She may be crazy but she's no wild child
She have the old folks out on sundays
Plays piano in a rock and blues band
She don't drink, smoke, dope or do cocaine
But she parties hard all the same
It's not what she say
Its all in her sway
Shes a shock to the system
It's not how she talk
It's all in her walk
She's a shock to the system
Oh yea
Shock me baby
Shock me baby
As I was walking home one night
In the streets that never sleep
In that sub terrainian part of town
Where love is never found
On a billboard on the topless place
I noticed her pretty face
It said appearing here twice nightly
(...........)
Well she had a whole lot of money
And went back home to michigan
She had maximized her potential
But didn't scandilaze the family name
It's not what she say
It's all in her sway
It's a shock to the system
It's not how she talk
It's all in her walk
She's a shock to the system
It's not what she say
It's all in her sway
It's a shock to the system
It's not how she talk
It's all in her walk
It's a shock to the system
