<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="Walking_In_The_Sunshine">
Oh my, just another day
When I look in the mirror and I am turning pretty truly grey
And I ain't waitin' around this town for my ship to come in
We can't spend half our lives just day dreamin'
Chorus
One of these days
Baby and it won't be long
We're out of here
Over that horizon
The day will come
When we'll be walkin' in the sunshine
All I want is a better life for you and me
Far away
It'll be an odyssey
Hand in hand
And we'll be walkin' in the sunshine
And we'll be walkin' in the sunshine
Oh my, these are scary times
There's bullet flyin'
And streets are burning
And I've a worried mind
I find my deliverance by the riverside
And I'll bathe my head in the cool, cool water and be satisfied (Yes I will)
Chorus
One of these days
Baby and it won't be long
We're out of here
Over that horizon
The day will come
When we'll be walkin' in the sunshine
All I want is a better life for you and me
Far away
It'll be an odyssey
Hand in hand
And we'll be walkin' in the sunshine
Oh yeah!
And we'll be walkin' in the sunshine
Bridge
Let's set sail for a brand new life
Where the vines and the olives grow
"Full steam ahead!" to a foreign land
Where the weather suits, the weather suits, the weather suits my clothes
Chorus
One of these days
Baby and it won't be long
We're out of here
Over that horizon
That day will come
And we'll be walkin' in the sunshine
All I want is a better life for you and me
Far away
It'll be an odyssey
We'll be free
And we'll be walkin' in the sunshine
Oh yeah!
Oh yeah!
Oh yeah!
Walkin' in the sunshine
