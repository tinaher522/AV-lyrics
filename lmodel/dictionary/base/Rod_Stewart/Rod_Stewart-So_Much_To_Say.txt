<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="So_Much_To_Say">
So much to say and so little time to say it in
I've got so much to say, baby, ha
But so little time to say it in
But whatever I tell ya'
I hope that you will obey
Now listen
Say your prayers ev'ry night
And be so good while I'm away
Now listen here
Say your prayers ev'ry night
and be so good while I'm away
Because you know I won't be gone for long
I'll be back home with you one of these little old days, hmm-mm
I know, I know, I know
As I'd have said so many times
I got so much to say and so little time to say it in
So much to say and so little time to say it in
And I know you'll be be a good little girl
while I'm away
Oh yeah hmm
