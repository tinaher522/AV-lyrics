<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="Gi'_Me_Wings">
Driving in my car; there's nothing on the air
Play a song that'll ease my pain
D.J.'s telling me that this is what'll be
Help me I'm depressed again
My best friend disappeared with the girl I had for years
My life's going down the drain
The skies are crying; everybody's lying
Oh God I'm depressed again
Give me wings I'll fly away
Magnificent and free
Far away from the madding crowd
There's gotta be a place for me
The boss is on my back; I know I'm gonna crack
Looks like I'm paranoid again
Can't do nothing right, see only black and white
Oh God I'm depressed again
Give me wings I'll fly away
Magnificent and free
Far away from the madding crowd
There's gotta be a place for me
How can I plan ahead with this hanging round my neck?
Looks like I'm coming down again
Thought about it well, analysed myself
Yeah, I'm depressed again
Give me wings I'll fly away
Magnificent and free
Far away from the madding crowd
There's gotta be a place for me
I'm down, I'm coming down again
I'm down, looks like I'm coming down again
I'm down, I'm down, looks like I'm coming down again
I'm down, I'm down, looks like I'm pissed off again... yeah!
