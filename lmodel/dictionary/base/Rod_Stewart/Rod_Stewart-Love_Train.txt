<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="Love_Train">
(People all over the world)  everybody
(Join hands) join
(Start a love train, love train)
(People all over the world)  everybody
(Join hands)  join
(Start a love train, love train)
The first stop that we make will be In England
Tell all the folks in Russia and China too
Don't you know that it's time to get on boardÂ ?
And let this train keep on riding, riding on through, well.
(People all over the world)  we all need join hands
(Join hands)  join hands
(Start a love train, love train)
(People all over the world)  everybody
(Join hands)  join
(Start a love train, love train)
All of your brothers over in Africa
Tell all the folks in Egypt and Israel too
Now, please, don't miss this train at the station
Because if you miss it, I feel sorry, sorry for you.
(People all over the world)  we all need join hands
(Join hands) join  hands
(Start a love train)  love train  (ove train)
(People all over the world)  everybody
(Join hands)  join
(Start a love train, love train)
(People all over the world)  don't waste your time
(Join hands)  join hands
(Start a love train)  love train  (ove train)
(People all over the world)  everybody
(Join hands)  join
(Start a love train, love train)
