<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="Hang_On_St._Christopher">
(Tom Waits)
Hang on St. Christopher 
Through the smoke and the oil 
Pumpin' iron around the scene 
Let the radiator boil 
Got no back down shift 
And a two dollar grill 
Got an '85 cab 
on an '85 hill  
*Hang on St. Christopher 
On the passenger side 
Open it up tonight 
So the devil can ride 
Hang on St. Christopher 
With a ballast door 
Kick me up ... 
Throw me out in the fog 
Tell ... Jack ... 
Drive a stake through his heart 
Do a hundred on the grapevine 
Do a jump on the start 
Hang on St. Christopher 
Now don't let me go 
Get me to Reno 
And bring it in low, low 
Hang On St. Christopher 
With the hammer to the floor 
Put a highball in the crankcase 
Nail a crow to the door 
Give me a bottle for the jockey 
Give me a two ... 
There's a certain ... 
Bustin' down Johnny's door 
(*Repeat) 
Let the devil ride 
Let the devil ride 
Let the devil ride 
Hang On St. Christopher 
Now don't let me go 
Get me to Reno 
Got to bring it in low 
Put my baby on a flatcar 
Tell 'em to burn down the caboose 
Get 'em all jacked up with whiskey 
And we'll turn the mad dog loose 
(*Repeat) 
Let him ride, let him ride 
Let him ride, let him ride 
Let him ride, let him ride 
HAng on St. Christopher 
Through the smoke and the oil 
Get me to Reno 
And bring it in low, low ...
