<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="To_Be_With_You">
Oh, yeah
A shoulder to cry on
Someone to lean on
Someone to take you away
Someone to talk to
And somewhere to walk to
I need to remind you someway
Whenever you need me
I'll make the time 
To be with you (be with you)
To be with you (be with you)
A night to remember
The rain in September
I want to share it with you
The month by the ocean
We swore our devotion
Making all our wishes come true, come true
Whenever you need me
I'll make the time 
To be with you (be with you)
To be with you (be with you)
I want you to know
I've never before
Felt this way
No other words can say
I was lost just yesterday
Until I found you 
Oh, yeah
Whenever you need me
I'll make the time 
To be with you (be with you)
To be with you (be with you)
The night to remember
The rain in September
I want to share it with you
The month by the ocean
We swore our devotion
Making all our wishes come true, come true
Oh, oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Ooh, ooh
