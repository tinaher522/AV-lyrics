<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="What_Do_You_Want_Me_To_Do?">
I tried to do the things in my own way
I tried to do what people say
But I was going nowhere fast
And now I'm turning to you at last
What do you want me to do
What so you want me to do
What do you want me to do, Lord
I can see the lights of home
But I can't get there on my own
I can see the landing strip
But I need you to guide my ship
What do you want me to do
What so you want me to do
What do you want me to do, Lord
I've been a fool and I've been a clown
I've let the enemy turn me around
I've wasted love and I've wasted time
I've been proud and I've been blind
There's such a lot of things to change
A whole world to rearrange
And if you show me how
I'll begin right now
What do you want me to do
What so you want me to do
What do you want me to do, Lord
What do you want me to do, Lord
What do you want me to do, Lord
"Cause I'm listenin', I'm listenin'
Lord, I'm listenin', I'm listenin'"
