<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="Can_We_Stay_Home_Tonight?">
Quarter past five and I'm half alive
Dead on my feet on 42nd street
Thinking about you, baby
Thinking about you now
Start up the car, I don't get too far
Traffic's insane and it's starting to rain
Oh, how I miss you, baby
Oh, how I miss you now
But oh, I'm one happy man
'Cause I believe, I believe for you and me
The Good Lord has a plan
I know you arranged to see a show out of town
But if you don't mind, I'd rather hang around
I just wanna spend time with you
And do all the things that we used to do
Oh, baby, can we stay home tonight?
Driving through the town, oh, my mind's in a muddle
There's a line at the toll gate, gonna be so late
Oh, how I miss you, baby
Oh, how I miss you now
Sam and Dave singing on the radio
Hold on, I'm coming, that's the way to go
Thinking about you, baby
Thinking about you now
But oh, I'm one happy man
'Cause I believe, I believe for you and me
The Good Lord has a plan
The kids are all sleeping, it's a quarter to nine
Let's celebrate with a glass of wine
Lay down on the sofa, kick off your shoes
Make love by the fire, like we used to do
Oh, baby, can we stay home tonight?
I've known you since you were just nineteen
And you're still the one and only girl for me
My love for you is still as strong
'Cause when Marvin sang, "Let's get it on"
Oh, baby, can we stay home tonight?
Oh, yeah, yeah
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
