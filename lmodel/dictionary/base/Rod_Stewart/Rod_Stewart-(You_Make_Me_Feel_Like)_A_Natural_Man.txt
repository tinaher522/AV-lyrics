<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="(You_Make_Me_Feel_Like)_A_Natural_Man">
Looking out on the morning rain 
I used to feel so uninspired
But when I knew I had to face another long, long day 
Girl I used to feel so tired
Before the day I met you 
Life had been so unkind 
But you're the key to my peace of mind
'Cause you made me feel, you made me feel
You made me feel like a natural man
When my soul was in the lost and found 
You came along to claim it
I didn't know, I didn't know just what was wrong with me 
Till your kiss helped me to name it
Now I'm no longer doubtful of what I'm living for 
But if I make you happy I don't need to do more
'Cause you made me feel, you made me feel
You made me feel like a natural man
Oo baby, baby look what you have done to me
Can't you see that you made me feel so good inside
Don't you know that I just want to be
Close to you, you made me feel so alive
'Cause you made me feel, you made me feel
You made me feel like a natural man
Baby I ain't doubtful of what I'm living for
But if I make you happy I don't need to do more
'Cause you made me feel, you made me feel
Well you made me feel like a natural man
