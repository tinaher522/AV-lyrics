Corrina Corrina 
God we have been so long 
Corrina Corrina 
God we have been so long 
I've been worried about you baby 
Baby please come home 
I got a bird that whistles 
I got a bird that sings 
I got a bird that whistles 
I got a bird that sings 
But I ain't got Corrina 
Love don't mean a thing 
Corrina Corrina 
God you're on my mind 
Corrina Corrina 
God you're on my mind 
I've been thinking about you baby 
Just can't keep from crying 
Corrina Corrina 
Corrina Corrina 
Corrina Corrina 
Corrina Corrina 
I've been thinking about you baby 
Baby please come home.
