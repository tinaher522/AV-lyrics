<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="In_A_Broken_Dream">
Every day I spend my time
Drinkin' wine, feelin' fine
Waitin' here to find the sign that I can understand
Yes I am
In the days between the hours
Ivory towers, bloody flowers
Push their heads in to the air
I don't care if I ever know
There I go
Don't push your love too far
Your wounds won't leave a scar
Right now is where you are
In a broken dream
Did someone bow their head?
Did someone break the bread?
Good people are in bed
Before nine o'clock
On the pad before my eyes
Paper cries, tellin' lies
The promises you gave
From the grave of a broken heart
Hmm
Every day I spend my time
Drinkin' wine, feelin' fine
Waitin' here to find the sign that I can understand
Yes I am
I sit here in my lonely room
Don't push your love too far
You know your wounds won't even leave a scar
Right now is where you are
In a broken dream
And don't you forget what I say
Hoo, hoo
