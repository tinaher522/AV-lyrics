<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="Come_Home_Baby">
I know just how bad I've hurt you
Oh yeah
Make it all up to you some way
What can I do just to prove I love you ?
Should I beg on my knees baby please come home ?
Come home baby
Baby just come on home
Come home baby
I need your love so bad
Come home baby
Yes I do
Come home baby
I'll be good to you, I promise
I'll do anything that you say
I want your kiss, I can't go on like this
Treat me bad if you must, baby just come home
Come home baby
Baby Baby Baby
Come home baby
I need your love so bad
Come home baby
Baby come on home
Baby come on home
Baby Baby Baby come home
What can I do just to prove I love you ?
Should I beg on my knees baby please come home ?
Come home baby
Baby just come on home
Come home baby
Any old time you wanna
Come home baby
I'll be right here, you know that, you know that
Come home baby
Come home
Come home baby
Need you right here
Come home baby
Baby come home
Come home baby
Please please come home
Come home baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
