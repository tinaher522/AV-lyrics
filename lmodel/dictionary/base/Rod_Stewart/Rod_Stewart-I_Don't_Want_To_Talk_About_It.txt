<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="I_Don't_Want_To_Talk_About_It">
I can tell by your eyes that you've probably been crying forever,
And the stars in the sky don't mean nothing to you, they're a mirror.
I don't want to talk about it, how you broke my heart.
If I stay here just a little bit longer,
If I stay here, won't you listen to my heart, ohh my heart?
If I stand all alone, will the shadow hide the colors of my heart;
Blue for the tears, black for the night's fears.
The stars in the sky don't mean nothing to you, they're a mirror.
I don't want to talk about it, how you broke my heart.
If I stay here just a little bit longer,
If I stay here, won't you listen to my heart, ohh my heart?
My heart, ohh my heart, this old heart.
I don't want to talk about it, how you broke my heart
If I stay here just a little bit longer,
If I stay here, won't you listen to my heart, ohh my heart?
My heart, ohh my heart.
