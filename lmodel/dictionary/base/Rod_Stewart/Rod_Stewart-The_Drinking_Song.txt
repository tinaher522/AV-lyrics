<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="The_Drinking_Song">
Like everybody else, I like a night on the town.
I love a bellavino when the sun goes down.
But unfortunately, one thing has led to another (yes it has).
I've struggled more than once to put the key in the door,
Fallen flat on my face on the disco floor,
But if I die, I'm gonna die laughing. (Now listen)
I've sung and I've danced in the streets of Paris,
Discovered my trousers up an old oak tree,
I've walked half naked through the hotel continental. (But you know what)
I'm glad I did what I did when I did it,
Make no mistake about that.
And i'm glad I said what I said when I said it, Oh yeah.
It was the drink that made me do it.
I know sometimes I blew it.
It was the drink that made me do it.
Every time, Every time.
I've skipped a lot, found out, and I've lost my socks.
Even spent the night in a telephone box.
I'm a sucker when I hear "one more for the road."
I've woken up with women that I hardly knew,
Wine is the cause of silly tattoos.
I've raised hell, where hell didn't need no raising.
But I'm glad I did what I did when I did it,
Make no mistake about that.
And I'm glad I said what I said, Oh yeah.
It was the drink that made me do it.
Sometimes I guess I blew it.
It was the drink that made me do it.
Every time.
Oh yeah
Ahh yeah
So, the moral of the story. Stick to tea and cakes.
If ya take to the drinking you're gonna make mistakes
I wouldn't change a thing, if I could do it again. (No I wouldn't)
It was the drink that make me do it.
Sometimes I knew I blew it.
It was the drink that made me do it.
Every time. Every time.
Oh yeah
Blame the drink!
