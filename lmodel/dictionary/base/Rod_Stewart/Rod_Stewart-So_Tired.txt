<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="So_Tired">
By the time I was home 
I was feeling bad 
Never the less I go mine 
Straight out of bed 
I was feeling my head 
But I'm 
So, tired I just got to get home 
So, tired I just got to get home 
Surely its time 
You should face the facts 
I'm not the one that you need 
I don't need to feed you
Or need you or lead you Im 
So, tired I just want to get home 
So, tired I just wanna get home 
I've never been one 
For just putting around 
Keep it in my trousers all night 
Surely I'm right 
When you stay out all night 
And I'm 
So, tired I just wanna go home 
So, tired I just wanna, wanna, 
Wanna go home
And you know that your 
Out of your depth my dear 
When you take home 
Someone like me
Its been such a long time 
I can hardly stay out 
And I'm 
So, tired I just wanna go home 
So, tired I just wanna go home 
So, tired I just wanna go home 
And I'm so
