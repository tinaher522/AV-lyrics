<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="The_Blues_(How_Blue_Can_You_Get_?)">
I've been downhearted baby
Ever since the first day that we met
I've been downhearted baby
Ever since the first day that we met
Your love ain't nothing but the blues
Woman, how blue can ya' get ?
You're evil when I'm with ya'
And oh, you're jealous when we're apart
Good God, you're jealous when I'm with ya' honey
And you're evil when we're apart
Your love ain't nothing but the blues
Woman, how blue can ya', can ya' get ?
Oh
You're evil when I'm with ya'
I bought you a brand new car
You said "I want a Cadillac"
I bought you a ten-dollar dinner
You said "Thank you for the snack"
I let you live in my penthouse
You said "That ain't nothing but a shack"
I gave you seven children
And now you wanna give 'em back !
Oh, I've been downhearted baby
Good God, I've been downhearted since we met
And listen, your love ain't nothing but the blues
Woman, how blue can ya' get ?
Yeah, oh
