<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="Hold_The_Line">
Hold on. We just have to hold on.
We don't have to cry. No, not tonight.
I know lately everything seems crazy.
People walking by. Just getting by.
And I just wanna rest my head.
And lay down with roses in our bed.
They say heaven can wait.
You and I, we'll survive.
Sometimes we're lost and astray,
And the hope far away.
Hold the line. We'll survive.
So lets just smile through the rain,
through the heartache and pain.
Hold the line. We'll survive.
We'll Survive
Hold the line
We'll survive
Slow down. We just have to slow down.
Hours are coming fast. Way too fast.
Another grey day, Technical, and save me
Painted in the sky. We're alive.
And I just wanna rest my head.
And lay down with roses in our bed.
They say heaven can wait.
You and I, we'll survive.
Sometimes we're lost and astray,
And the hope far away.
Hold the line. We'll survive.
So lets just smile through the rain,
through the heartache and pain.
Hold the line. We'll survive.
We'll Survive
Hold the line
We'll survive
Hold the line
We'll survive
Hold on. We just have to hold on.
We don't have to cry. No, not tonight.
I know lately everything seems crazy.
People walking by. Getting by.
Sometimes we're lost and astray,
And the hope far away.
Hold the line. We'll survive.
So lets just smile through the rain,
through the heartache and pain.
Hold the line. We'll survive.
We'll Survive
Oh yeah
Hold the line
We'll survive
Hold the line
We'll survive
We'll survive
