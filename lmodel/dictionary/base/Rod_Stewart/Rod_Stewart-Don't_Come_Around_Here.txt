<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="Don't_Come_Around_Here">
How do you know when it's over
How do you know where did it all go wrong
Can I embrace the perfect stranger
How do you know and where did it all go wrong
Cause lately could you tell 
I lost the only one
Could you tell
Stoke the funeral 
So now it's just me, myself and I
Don't come around here (don't come around here)
Just to see me cryin' (see me cryin')
Don't come around here (don't come around here)
Just because you can (because you can, yeah, yeah) 
Cause you can
How do you find tinsel Motown
How do you find it if it's the only one
Dear, love is strange the right emotion
How do you find if it's the only one
Cause lately (lately) could you tell (could you tell)
I lost the only one
Could you tell (could you tell, could you tell)
Stoke the funeral 
So now it's just me, myself and I
Don't come around here (don't come around here)
Just to see me cryin' (see me cryin')
Don't come around here (don't come around here)
Just because you can (because you can, yeah, yeah) 
Give me Motown (tinsel Motown, lady)
Tinsel Motown (one emotion maybe)
One emotion (with a perfect stranger)
Tinsel Motown (me, myself and I)
Don't come around here
Just to see me cryin'
Don't come around here
Just because you can
Don't come around here (don't come around here)
Just to see me cryin' (see me cryin')
Please don't come around here (don't come around here)
Just because you can (because you can, yeah, yeah) 
Cause you can
Don't come around here (don't come around here)
Just to see me cryin' (see me cryin')
Please don't watch me cryin' 
Please don't watch me cryin', yeah
Cause you can
Don't come around here
Please don't come around here
Just to see me cryin'...
