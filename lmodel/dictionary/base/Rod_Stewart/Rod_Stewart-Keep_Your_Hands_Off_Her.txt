<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="Keep_Your_Hands_Off_Her">
Keep your hands off her
Keep them big mitts down
Keep your hands off her
So keep them big mitts down
So keep your hands off her, hear what I say
She don't belong to you
She's a heavy hipped mama
Got them great big legs
She's a heavy hipped mama
She got them great big legs
She's a heavy hipped mama, got them great big legs
Got just what it takes, oh yeah
Keep your hands off her
Keep them big mitts down
Keep your hands off her
So keep them big mitts down
So keep your hands off her, hear what I say
She don't belong to you
Well, her name is Josie
Yes, her name is Josie
Well, her name is Josie
Yes, her name is Josie
Well, her name is Josie, but she ain't so nosy
But mmmm, she sure is cozy
One more
Keep your hands off her
Keep them big mitts down
Keep your hands off her
So keep them big mitts down
So keep your hands off her, hear what I say
She don't belong to you
She don't belong to you
