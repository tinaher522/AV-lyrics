Now let the day begin, the day begin
Here's to you my little love
With blessings from above
Now let the day begin, let the day begin, let the day, oh yeah
Now let the day begin, oh yeah
Here's to you my little love
With blessings from above
Now let the day begin, let the day begin, let the day, (	  )
Oh yeah
