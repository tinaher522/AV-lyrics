<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="Ain't_Misbehavin'">
No one to talk with, all by myself
No one to walk with but I'm happy on the shelf
Ain't misbehavin', I'm savin' my love for you.
I know for certain the one you love
I'm through with flirtin', it's just you I'm thinkin' of
Ain't misbehavin', I'm savin' my love for you.
Like Jack Horner in the corner
Don't go nowhere, what do I care ?
Your kisses are worth waitin' for, believe me.
I don't stay out late, don't care to go
I'm home about eight, just me and my radio
Ain't misbehavin', I'm savin' my love for you, ain't misbehavin'.
Like Jack Horner in the corner
Don't go nowhere, what do I care ?
Your kisses are worth waitin' for, believe me.
No one to talk with, all by myself
No one to walk with but I'm happy on the shelf
Ain't misbehavin', savin' my love for you.
And I don't stay out late, I don't care to go
I'm home about eight, just me and my radio
Ain't misbehavin', I'm savin' my love for you
Ain't misbehavin', I'm savin' my love for you
Mmm, savin' my love for you.
