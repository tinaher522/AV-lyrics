<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="Time">
Time waits for no one 
That's why can't wait on you 
Time waits for no one 
That's why can't wait on you 
Bittersweet all the memories of you 
But I don't suppose you ever felt that way too 
It was all I could do just to keep you entertained 
But I just another, another link in your chain 
Time waits for no one 
That's why can't wait on you 
Time waits for no one 
That's why can't wait on you 
Bittersweet all the memories of you 
I believed we had a future, constant intrude 
And I dreamed of a family and I life we could've shared 
But I guess you'll be much better off with me out of your hair 
Time waits for no one 
That's why can't wait on you 
Time waits for no one 
That's why can't wait on you 
I'll find someone else and I hope you do too 
But please don't come looking for me baby 
'Cause you know that we're through 
Time waits for no one 
That's why can't wait on you 
Time waits for no one 
That's why can't wait on you.
