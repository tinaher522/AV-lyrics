<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="September_In_The_Rain">
The leaves of brown came tumbling down
Remember, in september in the rain
The sun went out just like a dying ember
In september in the rain.
To every word of love I heard, you whisper
The raindrops seem to play a sweet refrain.
Though spring is here, to me it's still september
Ooh, that september in the rain.
To every word of love I heard, you whisper
The raindrops seem to play a sweet refrain.
Though spring is here, to me it's still september
That september, in the rain
That september, in the rain
That september, in the rain
That september, in the rain.
