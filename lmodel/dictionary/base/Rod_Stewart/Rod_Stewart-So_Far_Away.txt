<song artist="Rod_Stewart" title="So_Far_Away">
So far away
Doesn't anybody stay in one place anymore
It would be so fine to see your face at my door
But it doesn't help to know
That you're just time away
Long ago
I reached for you and, there you stood
Holding you again could only
Do me good
Oh how I wish I could
But you're so far away
Yeah
One more song about moving along the highway
I Can't say much of anything that's new
But if I could only work this life out my way
I'd rather spend it being close to you
But you're so far away
Doesn't anybody stay in one place anymore
It would be so fine to see your face at my door
But it doesn't help to know that you're
So far away
Yeah you're so far away
Travelling around sure gets me down and lonely
Nothing else to do but close my mind
And I sure hope the road don't get to own me
There's so many dreams, that I've yet to find
But you're so far away
Doesn't anybody stay in one place anymore
It would be so fine to see your face at my door
And it doesn't help to know that you're
So far away
You're so far away
But you're so far away
Doesn't anybody stay in one place anymore
It would be so fine to see your face at my door
And it doesn't help to know that you're
So far away
You're so far away
