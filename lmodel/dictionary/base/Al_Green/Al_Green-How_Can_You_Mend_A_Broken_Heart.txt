<song artist="Al_Green" title="How_Can_You_Mend_A_Broken_Heart">
I can think of younger days when living for my life
Was everything a man could want to do
I could never see tomorrow, I was never told about the sorrow
And how can you mend a broken heart?
How can you stop the rain from falling down?
Tell me, how can you stop the sun from shining?
What makes the world go round?
And how can you mend this broken man?
How can a loser ever win?
Somebody please, help me mend my broken heart and let me live again
La la la la la
I can still feel the breeze that rustles through the trees
And misty memories of days gone by
But we could never see tomorrow, would you believe that no one, no one, ever told us about the sorrow
So, how can you mend a broken heart?
How can you stop the rain from falling down?
Baby, how can you stop that ol' sun from shining?
What makes the world go round?
And sometimes I have to say La la la la
Tell me - help me mend my broken heart and let me live again
I just wanna live again, baby
How can you mend this broken man?
Somebody tell me, how can a loser ever win?
Baby, help me mend my - this ol' broken heart and let me live again
I think I, I believe I, I feel like I got to live again
How can you mend this broken heart?
Somebody please tell me, how can you stop the rain from falling down?
All over, all wet, tell me
How can you mend my broken heart
I think I, I believe I, I got a feeling that I gotta live
