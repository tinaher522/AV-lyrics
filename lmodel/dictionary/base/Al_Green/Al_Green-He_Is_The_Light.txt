<song artist="Al_Green" title="He_Is_The_Light">
There comes a time in everybody's life
When you're troubled and don't know what to do
With Jesus by your side and let Him be your guide
He's the one to hold on to
He'll be the light of the world when darkness is all around you
He'll be your friend in time of trouble, in time of need
You ever wonder why there's suns up in the sky
For Jesus it's just another stepping stone
With His outstretched hand he'll lead you on through the night
He promised it to hold on strong
Oh, he'll be the light of the world when darkness is all around, oh, oh, Yeah
He'll be your friend in time of trouble, in time of need
Oh, hold on to His hand
Hold on real strong, hold on, oh
He is the light of the world when darkness is all around you, listen now
He'll be your friend in time of trouble, in time of need, yeah, oh
He is the light of the world when darkness is all around you
You don't have to worry now, whoa, yeah
He'll be your friend in time of trouble, in time of need
Oh, oh yeah
He is the light, I'm so glad He is the light of the world
Yeah, oh yeah
He'll be your friend in time of trouble, in time of need
