<song artist="Al_Green" title="All_I_Need">
I wanna tell you one last time, all I need
Dont want no fussin, dont want no cryin
You're everything to me
All I need, all I need, all I need
Let me say you're
All I need, all I need, all I need
Once over and again for the last time
Something very wonderful is on my mind
Can I say it twice?
All I need, all I need, all I need
All I need, all I need, all I need
We can work it out with no delay
We don't have to fight nor take all day
Hear me now, hear what I say
Hear my plea because
All I need, all I need, all I need
I don't need nobody else
All I need, all I need, all I need
All I need, all I need, all I need
All I need, all I need, all I need
All I need, all I need, all I need
