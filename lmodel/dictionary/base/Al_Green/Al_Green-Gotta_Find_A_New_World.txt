<song artist="Al_Green" title="Gotta_Find_A_New_World">
as i look at this world
you know i'm beginning to see
that this is not the world
that god intended to be
i got to find a new world 
where the people understand 
how to treat one another
through out the land
everybody pack up and go with me
i got to find a new world 
were the people get along
where everybody loves each other.....
I wana hear people say... can I help ya
I got to hear people say... come on in
I wana hear people say... is there anything I can do for you
I got to hear people say... let me help you 
I wana be able to walk when I wana
I got to be able to talk when I wana
I wana be able to love when I need it ya...
