<song artist="Al_Green" title="I'd_Still_Choose_You">
I can love you ten thousand years, oh baby
I'd still feel the same, life's been a (Incomprehensible), oh baby
I'll have to keep on forever loving you, oh baby
Makes no matter what, what you say or do
If I had to do it all over
If I had to do it all over
I'd like to do it all over
I'd still choose you
I'd still choose you
I know it's gonna take some time, oh baby
Before I can make your sweet love mine, oh baby
I'll put the ring back on your finger, oh baby
(Incomprehensible) never linger
If I had to do it all over
I'd like to do it all over
I'd like to do it all over
And I would still choose you
Every flower I pick, dear darling
Would be roses all around
We go through life's ups and downs
Until your love hits the ground
I know it's gonna take some time, oh baby
I know it's all (Incomprehensible), oh baby
I still trust you, I grow in you
Forever and ever and ever and ever and ever
I, I'd hold you, until the time sake, forever
If I had to do it all over
I'd would do it all over
(Incomprehensible) it all over
I'd still choose you
Do it all over
Let me do it all over
Do it all over
And I would still choose you
Do it all over
I wouldn't take it all over
I'm gonna do it all over
I would still choose you
I love you, lady
Do it all over
Do it all over
Do it all over
I'd still choose you
