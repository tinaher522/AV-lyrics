<song artist="Al_Green" title="Simply_Beautiful">
If I gave you my love
I tell you what I'd do
I'd expect a whole lot of good love out of you
You've got to be good to me
I'm gonna be good to you
There's a whole lotta things that
You and I could do, Huh, Huhhh, Huhhh, Aw, Baby
What about the way you love me? Ohhh
And the way you squeeze me?, Yeah
Hey, Heyy, Simply beautiful
Yeah, beautiful, Heah
When you get right down it, Ohhh
Hey, Baby, Hey, Girl, Baby
When you needed me
I was right there beside you, girl
Baby, baby
Heyy, Oh, girl
Sometimes, when you're feeling low
All you got to do is call me, Uh Huh
Simply beautiful
Yeah, baby, yeah
Oh baby, There's so many good things
I could say about you, girl
I could say that I really, really
