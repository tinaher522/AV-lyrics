<song artist="Al_Green" title="Nobody_But_You">
Darling you were meant, 
for me, for me, for me.
Whatever you want baby,
You know I got it.
For you, for you,I want it for you.
You make my dreams, you make my life true
oh babe.
You make my life, oh my life's
Gonna be alright too.
(Chorus)
Nobody but you, baby.
Nobody but you X3
Nobody but you, baby. (Yes sir!)
Nobody but you X3 (yeah)
Darling you, I'm not gonna hurry
To explain (explain)
That you are everything.
I can't refrain (I can't refrain)

I can't explain (I can't explain)
Hold my hand, Hold my hand
Please try to understand.
You make my dreams, you light up my life. 
(oh boy!) I'm uhh.
I want you, I want you, I want you in my life. (Hey, Hey!)
(Chorus)
Nobody but you, baby. (Hey!)
Nobody but you X3 (Somebody sing.)
You, baby. (ohhh!)
Nobody but you X3
Can't you see, you're everything I've hoped for. (Yeah.)
Everything I need, You are so beautiful.
*Repeat Chorus and fade out*
