<song artist="Al_Green" title="My_Sweet_Sixteen">
You get up early in the morning
Just to see her rise
She's walking around the house
Yeah, in a complete disguise.
I don't know just how to tell you
Just how she changed so fast
But she's the prettiest thing
Yeah, in my life at last
I get mad when I see you with my baby
I can't stand to see you in my baby's place
Hey, I'm movin' with it
All the guys wanna dance
With my sweet little sixteen
I can't believe the way you hold me
I can't believe the way you console me
All the guys wanna dance
With my sweet little sixteen
All the fellows just wanna touch her
And hold her hand real tight
'Cause she's the prettiest thing
Yeah, out here tonight
Tell you one thing, if the dancing gets good to you
Way down in your soul, you try to move your body
You might lose control
Hey, let me tell you one thing, hey
I don't believe the way you hold me
The way you console me
All the guys wanna dance
With my sweet little sixteen
Hey, hey, all right
Tell you what I'll do
Let you talk with her
Tell you what I'll do
I'll let you walk with her
I believe I'll let you sing with her
I don't want you holding her, trying to console her
