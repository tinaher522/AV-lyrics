<song artist="Al_Green" title="Leave_The_Guns_At_Home">
Doo-doo-doo Doo-doo
Oh, a shot rings out another Mother's child is fallen
Never will her life be the same
The streets are filled with anger and with heartbreak
People trying to ease the pain
There was a time we could walk the street with some peace of mind (Yea)
Oh but this wicked shade our city
People saying it's a Pity
We all got a price to pay
Chorus
We got to leave the guns at home
We can't make in this world alone (ask anybody)
We got to leave the guns at home
We can't make in this world alone
We got to leave...
The time has come to play the game of violence
All around the world it's the same (same, same)
Why can't we see? 
We all got to share the responsibility
We all the blame
There was a time we could walk the street with some peace of mind
Oh not today
We got to fight the fears that seize us
Make them a believe us
We all in this together
And we all got to take a stand
Chorus
We got to leave the guns at home
We can't make in this world alone 
We got to leave the guns at home
Knowing we can't win this prize alone
The time is right
We all must lead the fight 
To answer to somebody
Everything going change
The stake points in this game
We must love one another
(Love one another)
Repeat Chorus and Fade Out
