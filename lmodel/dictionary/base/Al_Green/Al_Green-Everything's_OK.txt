<song artist="Al_Green" title="Everything's_OK">
I wanna, I wanna come back home, baby
Out here, baby, everything is wrong, baby
In a dog-eat-dog world
Ain't nothing safe, baby
You've got mine, and I've got yours
Everything's okay
I started, I started out poor baby (Everything is okay, baby)
Everybody knows you never told, baby (Everything is okay, baby)
I got what it takes (I've got what it takes)
with my crazy ways
You came along and started this song
Everything's okay
Okay, okay, okay, okay, everything
Everything is okay, baby
Okay, okay, okay, okay, everything
Everything is okay, baby
You came along  (You came along) with your crazy ways
You came along and started this song
Everything's okay
Okay, okay, okay, okay, everything
Everything is okay, baby
Okay, okay, okay, okay, everything
Everything is okay, baby
Okay, okay, okay, okay, Hey, everything
Everything is okay, baby
Okay, okay, everything
Everything is okay, baby
Okay, okay, okay, okay, everything
Everything is okay, baby
Okay, okay, okay, okay, everything
Everything is okay, baby
Okay, okay, okay, okay, everything
Everything is okay, baby
Okay, okay, okay, okay, everything
Everything is okay, baby
