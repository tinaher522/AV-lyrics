<song artist="Al_Green" title="Let's_Get_Married">
Sitting here
Wasting my time for you
And I'm not too crazy
About the idea
Having nothing to do
I'm tired of playing around
A girl in every town, oh
I wanna settle down
And stop fooling around
(Let's get married)
I've got to stop fooling around
(Let's get married)
Stop fooling around
(Let's get married)
You don't believe me
But
(Let's get married)
Let me say
I didn't mean to say
All the things I said
Oh, Lord
The way I felt in my heart
It came out that way
Let me tell you one thing
Don't wanna say anything
To drive you away
Let's get married today
(Let's get married)
Hey, hey, hey
(Let's get married)
(Let's get married)
All right
(Let's get married)
Let's get married today
Might as well
Might as well
Gonna take you
In my arms and hold you
Take you in my arms
And squeeze you
And take you in my arms
And love you every night
Just make everything
All right, all right
I wanna soothe you, baby
Let me soothe you, baby
I can soothe you, baby
I can wipe all your tears away
Uh huh, wipe all your tears away
Wipe all your tears away
Wipe all your tears away
Hey, hey, hey
You don't believe me
Ow, ow, ow.....
