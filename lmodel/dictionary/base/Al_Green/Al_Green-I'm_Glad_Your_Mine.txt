<song artist="Al_Green" title="I'm_Glad_Your_Mine">
Baby, I'm so glad you're here
Baby, I've got something to say, my dear
Baby, yeah, I'm just so glad you're mine
Whoa ho, baby, why did it take so long?
Whoa baby, only made my love grow strong
Baby, yeah, yeah, I'm so glad you're mine
Hey, hey, hey, hey
When darkness gather 'round me
And friends forsaken me
I know you'll never let me down
I know you'll never let me down
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Baby, I'm not gonna leave you alone
Baby, oh, hop on and I'll give you what you want
Baby, yeah, so glad you're mine
Hey, hey, hey, hey
When darkness gather 'round me
And friends forsaken me
I know you'll never let me down
I know you'll never let me down
Woo, hoo, boy, oh, yeah, hey
You'll never hear me say
Baby, I'm gonna turn my back and walk away
(Baby, baby)
Baby, I'll see you another day, hey
Baby, I'm so, I'm so
(Baby)
Thankful for your love, angel
Thankful for your love, every day
Glad you're mine
Aww, hey, hey, hey
Yeah, hey, hey, thankful for your love
