<song artist="Al_Green" title="Be_My_Baby">
Down the oceanside, all my tears subside
but I feel I could see my baby
I can't wait today, don't want it to end this way
but I, I wanna be your man, be your man
Won't you be my baby?
Won't you be my baby girl
Oh, Won't you be my baby, Be my special girl
Everytime I see you run
It seems like I'm having fun, But I, I wanna be your man
Everytime I see you cry, Everytime I wonder why
figure I oughta hold your hand, hold your hand
Won't you be my lady? Oh, baby
Won't you be my baby girl, Hey, girl
Won't you be my baby?
be my special girl
Won't you be my lady? Heyyy, Hey!!
Won't you be my baby girl
Won't you be my lady?
Be my, Be my special girl
Won't you be my lady? Hey, Ho
Won't you be my baby girl
Won't you be my lady?
Be my, be my special girl
Won't you be my lady? Yeah! Seems so good to me!
Won't you be my baby girl, yeah
Won't you be my baby, baby baby baby?
Oh, My, My, My, My, My, My, My, Ohhh! 
 
Won't you be my lady? Owww!
Won't you be my baby girl
Won't you be my lady?
Be my, Be my special girl
