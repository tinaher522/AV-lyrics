<song artist="Al_Green" title="Nothing_Takes_The_Place_Of_You">
I moved your picture
From my walls
And i replaced them
Both large and small
And each new day
Finds me so blue
Nothing
Takes the place of you
I read your letters one by one
And i still love you
When it's all said and done
And oh, my darling, i'm so blue
Because nothing
Oh nothing
Takes the place of you
I, i write this letter
It's raining on my window pane
I, i feel the need of you
Because without you
Nothing seems the same
So i'll wait
Until you're home
Again i love you
But i'm all alone
And oh my darling
I'm so blue
Because nothing
Oh, but nothing takes the place of you.
