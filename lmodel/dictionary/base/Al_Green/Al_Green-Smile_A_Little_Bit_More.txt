<song artist="Al_Green" title="Smile_A_Little_Bit_More">
i smile
my heart
disappears
oh smile &amp; move
your burning feet
so just smile a little bit more, a little bit more
hey we just smile a little bit more, a little bit more
oh dear 
can bring
sudden rain i can think yea
our turn to see the winds change
soo smile
all you gotta do is just smile
in my heart i see the winter
making me do over but iiiii i don't mind 
i just smile a little bit more a little bit more
"still incomplete"
