<song artist="Al_Green" title="Take_Me_To_The_River">
I'd like to dedicate this song to Little Junior Parker, a cousin of mine who's gone on but we'd like to kinda carry on in his name, by singing
I don't know why I love like I do
After all the changes that you put me through
You stole my money and my cigarettes
And I haven't seen hide nor hair of you yet
I wanna know
Won't you tell me
Am I in love to stay, hey, hey
Take me to the river
Wash me down
Won't you cleanse my soul
Put my feet on the ground
I don't know why she treated me so bad
After all the things that we could have had
Love is a notion that I can't forget
My sweet sixteen I will never regret
I wanna know
Won't you tell me
Am I in love to stay, hey, hey
Hold me, love me, please me, tease me
'Til I can't, 'til I can't take anymore
Take me to the river
I don't know why I love you like I do
After all the things that you put me through
There's sixteen candles that burn on my wall
Turning me into the biggest fool of them all
I wanna know
Can't you tell me
Am I in love to stay, hey, hey
I wanna know
Take me to the river
I wanna know
Won't you dip me in the water
I wanna know
Won't you wash me in the water
Wash me in the water
Wash me in the water
Won't you wash me in the water
Feelin' good
