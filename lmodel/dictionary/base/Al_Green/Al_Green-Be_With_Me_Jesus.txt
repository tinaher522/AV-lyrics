<song artist="Al_Green" title="Be_With_Me_Jesus">
Oh Lord, the time is growing nigh
When I must breathe my last breath inside
Lord, in my dying hour, stay with me, Lord
Oh Lord, my friends have gathered 'round
They're watching me slowly, slowly sinking down
Lord, in my dying hour, stay with me, Lord
Now Lord, now Lord, now Jesus time have come
When I'm a leave my earthly home
Friends standing around, tear in the eyes
They know that I am about to die
But I'm not worried, I'm not afraid
I know you do, Jesus, just what You say
(???)
You be with me Lord, day and night
I'm not afraid, I said I'm dying, don't leave me now
Oh Lord, I know you'll stand by me
When I'm in trouble, when I'm in misery
And Lord, in my dying hour, stay with me, Lord
Oh oh Lord, I know You'll stand by Your word
Whenever I call You, I know You have already heard
Lord, in my dying hour, stay with me, Lord
Now Lord, I said farewell, fare thee well
Fare thee well to my friends down here
I got loved ones waiting for me up there
Oh Lord, others are waiting for me
What a reunion, I know that will be
Lord, in my dying hour, stay with me, Lord
