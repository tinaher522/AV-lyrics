<song artist="Al_Green" title="To_Sir,_With_Love">
The time has come
For closing books and long last looks must end yeah
And as I leave
I know that I am leaving my best friend
A friend who taught me right from wrong
And weak from strong
That's a lot to learn
What what can I give you in return
If you wanted the moon
I would try to make a start
But I would rather you let me give my heart
To you sir with love
Those school days
Of telling tales and biting nails are gone
But in my mind
I know that they live on and on and on and on
But how do you thank someone
Who has been so good to you
Well it's not easy oooh
But I'll try
If you wanted the sky
I would write across the sky in letters
That would soar a thousand feet high
To sir with love
The time has come
For closing books and long last looks must end yeah
And as I leave yeah
I know that I am leaving my best friend
A friend who taught me right from wrong
And weak from strong
That's a lot to learn
What what can I give you in return
If you wanted the moon
I would try to make a start
But I would rather you let me give my heart
Oh sir with love
Yeah 
oh yeah 
yeah yeah
yeah yeah 
yeah yeah yeah
