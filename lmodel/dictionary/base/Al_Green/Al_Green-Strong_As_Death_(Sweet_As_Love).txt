<song artist="Al_Green" title="Strong_As_Death_(Sweet_As_Love)">
Strong as death, sweet as love
with the grace, of a dove
Oh baby
Let me in your life
We don't have that much time
There's no need in us crying
Hey baby
I'm in the mood for love
If I could tell a story
Of just how it was
Before there was you and me
Before there was love
It was a sad affair
I got to go ahead with myself
Before I find ???
Help me off the shelf
Sweet baby
One more thing I got to say
Strong as death,
You're a power to be
Sweet as love,
To you and me
Hey baby
Take a chance on me
Strong as death, sweet as love
Hey let me just sing
Strong as death, honey, sweet as love
Strong as death, honey, sweet as love
Strong as love, sweet as love
ah, you're playing to much music for me
