Hey, girl
I got something real important to give you
So just sit down
And listen
Girl, you know we been together
Such a long, long time
(Such a long time)
And now I'm ready
To lay it on the line
Well, you know it's Christmas
And my heart is open wide
(Open wide)
Gonna give you something so you know what's on my mind
(What's on my mind)
A gift real special
So take off the top
Take a look inside
It's my dick in a box
(It's in a box)
Not gonna get you a diamond ring
That sort of gift don't mean anything
Not gonna get you a fancy car
Girl, you gotta know you're my shining star
Not gonna get you a house in the hills
A girl like you needs something real
I wanna get you something from the heart
(Something special, girl)
It's my dick in a box!
My dick in a box, babe
It's my dick in a box!
(Ooh)
My dick in a box, girl
See, I'm wise enough to know when a gift needs giving, girl
And I got just the one
Something to show you that you are second to none
To all the fellas out there with ladies to impress
It's easy to do
Just follow these steps:
One:
Cut a hole in a box
Two:
Put your junk in that box
Three:
Make her open the box
And that's the way you do it
It's my dick in a box!
My dick in a box, babe
It's my dick in a box!
(Oh)
My dick in a box, girl
Christmas
Dick in a box
Hanukkah
Dick in a box!
Kwanzaa
A dick in a box
Every single holiday, a dick in a box
Over at your parents' house, a dick in a box
Meat Day at the grocery store, a dick in a box
Backstage at the CMAs, a dick in a box
Yeah
A dick in a box
Dick in a box
Dick in a box
