<song artist="Justin_Timberlake" title="My_Love">
Ain't another woman that can take your spot my...
If I wrote you a symphony
Just to say how much you mean to me, what would you do?
If I told you you were beautiful
Would you date me on the regular, tell me, would you?
Well, baby I've been around the world
But I ain't seen myself another girl like you
This ring here represents my heart
But there's just one thing I need from you, say "I do"
Yeah, because
I can see us holdin' hands
Walkin' on the beach, our toes in the sand
I can see us on the countryside
Sittin' on the grass, laying side by side
You could be my baby
Let me make you my lady, girl, you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothin' crazy
See, all I want you to do is be my love
(So don't give away) My love
(So don't give away) My love
(So don't give away) Ain't another woman that can take your spot, my love
(So don't give away) My love
(So don't give away) My love
(So don't give away) Ain't another woman that can take your spot, my love
Oh, girl
My love
My love
Now, if I wrote you a love note
And made you smile with every word I wrote, what would you do?
Would that make you want to change your scene
And wanna be the one on my team, tell me, would you?
See, what's the point in waiting anymore?
'Cause girl I've never been more sure, that baby, it's you
This ring here represents my heart
And everything that you've been waiting for, just say "I do"
Yeah, because
I can see us holding hands
Walking on the beach, our toes in the sand
I can see us on the countryside
Sitting on the grass, laying side by side
You could be my baby
Let me make you my lady, girl, you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothin' crazy
See, all I want you to do is be my love
(So don't give away) My love
(So don't give away) My love
(So don't give away) Ain't another woman that can take your spot, my love
(So don't give away) My love
(So don't give away) My love
(So don't give away) Ain't another woman that can take your spot, my love
Oh, girl
My love
My love

Alright, it's time to get it JT
I don't know why she hesitates for a man
Shorty, cool as a fan on the new once again
But he still has fan from Peru to Japan
Listen baby, I don't wanna ruin with your plan
But if you got a man, try to lose him if you can
'Cause the girl's real wild, throw their hands up high
When they wanna come kick it with a standup guy
You don't really wanna let the chance go by
'Cause you ain't been seen wit' a man so fly
Baby, friend so fly I can go fly
Private, 'cause I handle mine
T.I. they call me candle guy
Simply 'cause I am on fire
I hate to have to cancel my vacation so you can't deny
I'm patient, but I ain't gonna try
You don't come, I ain't gonna die
Hold up, what you mean, you can't go why?
Me and you boyfriend we ain't no tie
You say you wanna kick it when I ain't so high
Well baby, it's obvious that I ain't your guy
I ain't gon' lie, I feel your space
But forget your face, I swear I will
Same bark, same bullet, anywhere I chill
Just bring wit me any pair, I will
I can see us holding hands
Walking on the beach, our toes in the sand
I can see us on the countryside
Sitting on the grass, laying side by side
You could be my baby
Let me make you my lady, girl, you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothin' crazy
See, all I want you to do is be my love
(Love) My love
(Love) My love
(Love) Ain't another woman that can take your spot, my love
(Love) My love
(Love) My love
(Love) Ain't another woman that can take your spot, my love
Oh, girl
My love
My love
