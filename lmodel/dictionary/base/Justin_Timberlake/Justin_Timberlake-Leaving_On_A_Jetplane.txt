<song artist="Justin_Timberlake" title="Leaving_On_A_Jetplane">
All my bags are packed
I'm ready to go
I'm standing here outside your door 
I hate to wake you up to say goodbye
But the dawn is breaking, it's early morn'
The taxi 's waiting, he's blowing his horn, 
Already I'm so lonesome I could die
So kiss me and smile for me
Tell me that you'll wait for me
Hold me like you'll never let me go
I'm leaving on a jet plane,
Don't know when I'll be back again,
Oh babe I'd hate to go 
I'd hate to go...
There 're so many times I've let you down
So many times I've played around
But now you know that they don't mean a thing
Every place I go, I'll think of you
Every song I sing, I'll sing for you
When I come back I'll wear your wedding ring
So kiss me and smile for me
Tell me that you'll wait for me
Hold me like you'll never let me go
I'm leaving on a jet plane
Don't know when I'll be back again
Oh babe, I hate to go
I hate to go...
Now the time has come to leave you
One more time, let me kiss you
Close your eyes and I'll be on my way
Dream about the days to come
When I won't have to leave alone,
About the times when I don't have to say...:
So kiss me and smile for me
Tell me that you'll wait for me
Hold me like you'll never let me go
I'm leaving on a jet plane,
Don't know when I'll be back again,
Oh babe I'd hate to go 
I'd hate to go...
I'm leaving on a jet plane, I'm leaving on a jet plane, 
I'm leaving on a jet plane, I', leaving on a jet plane.......(fade)
