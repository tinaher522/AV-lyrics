Hey little mama
Ain’t gotta ask me if I want to
Tell me, can I get a light?
Throw you up and let it run through
Cause I can always see the finest stars and I want you
I don’t ever wanna ever go down off this type of lovin’ you
Cause now you got me hopped up on that
Pusher love
So high I’m on the ceiling baby
You’re my drug
So gon’ and be my dealer baby
Give me all
Cause all I want is you, baby
One more time
Pusher love
Cause now you got me hopped up on that
Pusher love
So high I’m on the ceiling baby
You’re my love
So gon’ and be my dealer baby
Give me all
All I want is you, baby
You’re my little pusher love girl (Ain’t ya?)
Just my little pusher love girl
Now hey little mama
I love this how you give it to
And I know that you’re supply
Won’t run out anytime soon
You gave me a taste, now I know there’s a bit of you
I don’t wanna ever come down off this type of lovin’ you
Cause now you got me hopped up on that
Pusher love
So high I’m on the ceiling baby
You’re my drug
So come and be my dealer baby
Give me all
Cause all I want is you, baby
One more time
Pusher love
Cause now you got me hopped up on that
Pusher love
So high I’m on the ceiling baby
You’re my drug
So come and be my dealer baby
Give me all
Cause all I want is you, baby
You’re my little pusher love girl (Ain’t ya?)
Just my little pusher love girl
Since you came around, I’ve been 
I don’t wanna come down from this love I got on high
People call me a loser, but I want you
To go on and use me too
'Cause I want it through
I want you, baby
You know who you are,
Now you got me high!
Cause now you got me hopped up on that
Pusher love
So high I’m on the ceiling baby
You’re my drug
So go and be my dealer baby
Give me love
Cause all I want is you, baby
One more time
Pusher love
So high I’m on the ceiling baby
You’re my drug
So come and be my dealer baby
Pull me up
All I want is you, baby
Pusher love
So high I’m on the ceiling baby
You’re my drug
So come and be my dealer baby
Pull me up
All I want is you, baby
Pusher love
So high I’m on the ceiling baby
You’re my drug
So come and be my dealer baby
Pull me up
All I want is you, baby
You’re my little pusher love girl (Ain’t ya?)
So sweet, yes you are
Just my little pusher love girl
She’s my little pusher love girl
And I don’t nobody else yeah
You’re all I need
Just you and me
My little pusher love girl
