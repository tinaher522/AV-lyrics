<song artist="Justin_Timberlake" title="Dress_On">
There’s something bout your body
I’m not in a rush, but girl I’m ready to marry you
Yeah right here in this restaurant
And start on our honeymoon
Why you still got your dress on
Why you still got your dress on, yeah
Now I ain’t tryina offend nobody
But girl don’t they see you, it's cool if they don’t
Cause hey I only see me and you
That’s why I’m all over you
Why you still got your dress on
Why you still got your dress on, yeah, yeah, yeah
I can’t wait, cause girl as soon as I look in your face
I see your world where a heart never breaks
And to me that means that the whole world could change
But not mine
I can’t wait, the way I know your body
I don’t really need much, girl I know where to touch
Just stay where you are, drop all your worries
And we can leave all the rest on
We can do it, 
Why you still got your dress on, yeah
Now I ain’t tryina offend nobody
But girl don’t they see you, it's cool if they don’t
Cause hey I only see me and you
That’s why I’m all over you
Why you still got your dress on
Why you still got your dress on, yeah, yeah, yeah
I can’t wait, cause girl as soon as I look in your face
I see your world where a heart never breaks
And to me that means that the whole world could change
But not mine
I can’t wait
Let me take you, so walk with me
Feel beautiful sand as we take pictures
Hips so wide, look like it's got whiskers
Let me put a solid gold on a solid figure
Go ahead, show your pretty dinches
Your pretty physique, your pretty toes
I’m pretty with you
I do a good job for that pretty picture
You’re the prettiest, but I’m the only thing that’s missing
I can’t wait, cause girl as soon as I look in your face
I see your world where a heart never breaks
And to me that means that the whole world could change
But not mine, yeah
Why you still got your dress on
Still got your, still got, still got, still got
Why you still got your dress on
I can’t wait, cause girl as soon as I look in your face
I see your world where a heart never breaks
And to me that means that the whole world could change
But not mine.
