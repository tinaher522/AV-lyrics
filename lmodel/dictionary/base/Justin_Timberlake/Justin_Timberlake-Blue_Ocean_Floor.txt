<song artist="Justin_Timberlake" title="Blue_Ocean_Floor">
Frequency so low held on a string
A string that only plays solos
Rain made of echoes
Tidal wave rushing on and on
Under the water you scream so loud
But the silence surrounds you
But I hear it loud when you fall in the deep and I'll always find you
If my red eyes don't see you anymore
And I can't hear you through the white noise
Just send your heart beat, I'll go
To the blue ocean floor
Where they'll find us no more
On the Blue Ocean Floor
On the Blue Ocean Floor
On the Blue Ocean Floor
On the Blue Ocean Floor
On the Blue Ocean Floor
Shell made out of gold
Found on a beach picked up in your hand held so close
Rain washed out its glow, heart beat steady leads me down below
And under the water you scream so loud
But the silence surrounds you
But I hear it loud when you fall in the deep and I'll always find you
If my red eyes don't see you anymore
And I can't hear you through the white noise
Just send your heart beat, I'll go to the blue ocean floor
Where they'll find us no more
On the Blue Ocean Floor
On the Blue Ocean Floor
On the Blue Ocean Floor
On the Blue Ocean Floor
On the Blue Ocean Floor
20,000 leagues away catch up to you on the same day
Travel at the speed of light thinking the same thought at the same time
Heartbeat's at a steady pace, I'll let the rhythm show me the way
No one can find us here, fade out and disappear
If my red eyes don't see you anymore
And I cant hear you through the white noise
Just send your heart beat, I'll go to the blue ocean floor
Where they'll find us no more
On the Blue Ocean Floor
On the Blue Ocean Floor
On the Blue Ocean Floor
On the Blue Ocean Floor
On the Blue Ocean Floor
