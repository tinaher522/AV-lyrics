A Song That I Wrote That Justin Sang!!
Verse 1:
I'm sitting here alone 
Asking myself what am I doing?
I'm crying here alone 
Asking myself what to do next
Pre- Chorus:
See I was good to you
But you did not except that
And I did for you
All the things I can
Chorus:
You Weren't there
To help me through
You Weren't there
To love me too
I'm sitting here, alone asking myself what to do
You weren't there
Verse 2:
I can't believe you are
Having fun with some other guy
And there is not no more
Hope in this stupid relationship
Pre- Chorus:
See I was good to you
But you did not except that
And I did for you
All the things I can
Chorus:
You Weren't there
To help me through
You Weren't there
To love me too
I'm sitting here, alone asking myself what to do
You weren't there
Bridge:
You weren't there to help me through
Girl I'm lost without you
I can't believe you just slammed the door
I'm not takin this s*** no more
Now I see your having fun
This relationship will be done!
Chorus:
You Weren't there
To help me through
You Weren't there
To love me too
I'm sitting here, alone asking myself what to do
You weren't there
Oh no, no, no, no
You Weren't there
No, No, No, No
You weren't there
