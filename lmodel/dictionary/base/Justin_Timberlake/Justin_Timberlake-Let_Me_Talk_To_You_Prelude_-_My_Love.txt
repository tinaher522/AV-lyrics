<song artist="Justin_Timberlake" title="Let_Me_Talk_To_You_Prelude_-_My_Love">
Hey, hey, hey
My love, uh huh, my love, hey
My love, hey, my love, hey
My love, hey, my love, hey
My love, hey, my love, hey
My love, hey, my love, hey
My love, hey, my love, hey
My love, hey, my love, hey
My love, my love, my love
I love the way you're standing
Lips look so sweet, like cotton candy
(My love)
That don't mean you gotta stop dancing
'Cause the way that you move is so demanding
(My love)
Let's put it on cruise control
Let me take you to the crib
Let me ease your soul
(My love)
I'm gonna take it nice and slow
But first let me, let me, let me talk to her
My love, hey, my love, hey
My love, hey, my love, hey
My love, hey, my love, hey
My love, hey, my love, hey
My love, hey, my love, hey
My love, hey, my love, hey
My love, hey, my love, hey
My love, hey, my love, my love
Walk into my great place, cozy
I'm glad you came, let's make a toast to
(My love)
Let me make an indecent proposal
Let me take you to the back and do what we're suppose to
(My love)
Let's take a trip to the bayou
You can be the investigator, I'm your private I
(My love)
You know I want a piece of that pie
But first let me, let me, let me talk to her
My love, hey, my love, hey
My love, hey, my love, hey
My love, hey, my love, hey
My love, hey, my love, hey
My love, hey, my love, hey
My love, hey, my love, hey
My love, hey, my love, hey
Ain't another woman that could take your spot my
If I wrote you a symphony
Just to say how much you mean to me
(What would you do?)
If I told you you were beautiful
Would you date me on the regular?
(Tell me would you?)
Well baby, I've been around the world
But I ain't seen myself another girl
(Like you)
This ring here represents my heart
But there's just one thing I need from you
(Say I do)
Because I could see us holding hands
Walking on the beach, our clothes in the sand
I can see us on the countryside
Sittin' on the grass layin' side by side
You could be my baby
When I look at my lady
Girl, you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothin' crazy
See all I want you to do is be
My love, so don't give away
My love, so don't give away
My love, so don't give away
Ain't another woman that can take your spot
My love, so don't give away
My love, so don't give away
My love, so don't give away
Ain't another woman that can take your spot
My love, love, my love, my love
Now if I wrote you a love note
And made you sign up every word I wrote
(What would you do?)
Would that make you want to change your scene
And want to be the one on my team?
(Tell me would you?)
See, what's the point in waiting anymore?
'Cause girl, I never been more sure
(That baby, it's you)
This ring here represents my heart
And everything that you've been waiting for
(Just say it, I do)
Because
I could see us holding hands
Walking on the beach, our clothes in the sand
I can see us on the countryside
Sittin' on the grass layin' side by side
You could be my baby
When I look at my lady
Girl, you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothin' crazy
See all I want you to do is be
My love, so don't give away
My love, so don't give away
My love, so don't give away
Ain't another woman that can take your spot
My love, so don't give away
My love, so don't give away
My love, so don't give away
Ain't another woman that can take your spot
My love, love, my love, my love
Shorty cool as a fan
On the new once again
But he still has fans from Peru to Japan
Hey listen baby, I don't wanna ruin your plan
But if you got a man, try to lose him if you can
'Cause the girls real wild, throw they hands up high
When they wanna come kick it wit a stand up guy
You don't really wanna let a chance go by
Because you ain't been seen wit a man so fly
Baby France so fly, I can't go fly
Private, 'cause I handle mine BI
They call me candle guy
Simply 'cause I am on fire
I hate to have to cancel
My vacation so you can't deny
I'm patient, but I ain't gonna try
You don't come, I ain't gonna die
Hold up, what you mean, you can't go, why?
Me and your boyfriend we ain't no tie
You say you wanna kick it when I ain't so high
Well baby, you decide just that I ain't your guy
I ain't gon' lie, I feel your space
Then forget your face, I swear I will
Same mark, same bullet anywhere I chill
Just bring wit me a pair, I will
I could see us holding hands
Walking on the beach, our clothes in the sand
I can see us on the countryside
Sittin' on the grass layin' side by side
You could be my baby
When I look at my lady
Girl, you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothin' crazy
See all I want you to do is be
My love, love
My love, love
My love, love
Ain't another woman that can take your spot
My love, love
My love, love
My love, love
Ain't another woman that can take your spot
My love, love, my love, my love
