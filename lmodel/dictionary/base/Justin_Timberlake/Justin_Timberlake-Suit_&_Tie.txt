Justin Timberlake &amp; Timbaland:
I be on my suit and tie, shit tied, shit tied
I be on my suit and tie shit tied, shit
Can I show you a few things?
A few things, a few things, little baby, 'cause
I be on my suit and tie, shit tied, shit
I be on my suit and tie, shit tied, shit
Let me show you a few things
Let me show you a few things
Timbaland:
Wait a minute. You ready, JT?
Justin Timberlake:
I can’t wait till I get you on the floor, good looking
Going hot, so hot just like an oven
And oww, burned myself I just had to touch it
It’s so fire and it’s all mine
Hey baby, we don’t mind all the watchin'
'Cause if they study close, real close, they might learn somethin'
She ain't nothin' but a little doozie when she does it
She’s so fire tonight
And as long as I've got my suit and tie
I'mma leave it all on the floor tonight
And you got fixed up to the nines
Let me show you a few things (show you a few things)
All pressed up in black and white
And you dressed in that dress I like
Love is swinging in the air tonight
Let me show you a few things (show you a few things)
Let me show you a few things,
Show you a few things about love (love)
Now we're in the swing of love
Let me show you a few things, show you a few things
About love, hey.
Stop, let me get a good look at it
Ooh, so thick, now I know why they call it a fatty
And aww, shit's so sick got a hit and picked up a habit
That’s alright 'cause you’re all mine
Aww, go on and show ‘em who you call daddy
I guess they’re just mad 'cause girl they wish they had it
Ooh, my killer, my thriller, yeah you’re a classic
And you’re all mine tonight
And as long as I've got my suit and tie
I'mma leave it all on the floor tonight
And you got fixed up to the nines
Let me show you a few things (show you a few things)
All pressed up in black and white
And you dressed in that dress I like
Love is swinging in the air tonight
Let me show you a few things (show you a few things)
Let me show you a few things,
Show you a few things about love (love)
Now we're in the swing of love
Let me show you a few things, show you a few things
About love, hey.
Timbaland
Get out your seat, Hov.
Jay-Z:
All black at the white shows
White shoes at the black shows
Green card for the Cuban links
Y'all sit back and enjoy the light show
Nothing exceeds like excess
Stout got gout from having the best of the best
Is this what it's all about?
I'm at the restaurant
My rant disturbing the guests
Years of distress, tears on the dress
Trying to hide her face with some make up sex
Ugh
This is truffle season, Tom Ford tuxedos for no reason
All saints for my angel, Alexander Wang too
Ass tight denim and some Dunks
I show you how to do this young
Ugh, no papers, catch vapors
Get high, out Vegas
Deuces on doubles
Ain't looking for trouble
You just got good jeans so a nigga tryna cuff you
Tell your mother that I love her 'cause I love you
Tell your father we go farther as a couple
They ain't lose a daughter, got a son
I show you how to do this, hun!
Justin Timberlake:
And as long as I've got my suit and tie
I'mma leave it all on the floor tonight
And you got fixed up to the nines
Let me show you a few things (show you a few things)
All pressed up in black and white
And you dressed in that dress I like
Love is swinging in the air tonight
Let me show you a few things (show you a few things)
Let me show you a few things,
Show you a few things about love, l-love
L-l-let me show you a few things, show you a few things
About love, hey.
Oh!
Ba da da doo!
Ah, whoo ooh oh
Yeah yeah.
