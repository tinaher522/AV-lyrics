<song artist="Justin_Timberlake" title="Stepping_Out_Tonight">
I'm steppin out tonight
I'm steppin out tonight
We're steppin out tonight
We're steppin out tonight
I've got these feeling only
There's something 'bout tonight
My favorite girl just called me
To see her right so
I told her i'll be waiting 
Inside to see her faces
To touch my favorite places
I'll run her waist 
And there's something 'bout the way that it moves where she wants it to move
Can't get my hands around
So stop on my place when the dj starts to play her favorite groove
Cuz you know i'll be
I'm steppin out tonight
I'm steppin out tonight
Movin' on
Ladies on the right
Ladies on the left
All looking fresh
But just to impress
We're steppin out tonight
We're steppin out tonight
People on the east
People on the west 
North and south everybody everybody step step....
