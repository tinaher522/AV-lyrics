You girl this little game you play
It don’t stop till you go too far
So what’s a man like me to say
With a bullet laying in my heart, damn, love
We got from so high to so low
What am I gonna do with all this damn love
Is this fucking insane or insane
I guess that’s the role we play
She loves me now, she loves me not
She loves me now but only when I walk away
She loves me now, she loves me not
She loves me now but only when I walk away
Now what that baby what you say
Cause you don't wanna light up this torch
Cause I'll burn it down all the way
Running back till it ain’t no more
Damn, love, how did the sound get so amped up?
Turn off, in silence, this damn love
Is this fucking insane or insane
It guess that's the role that we play
She loves me now, she loves me not
She loves me now but only when I walk away
She loves me now, she loves me not
She loves me now but only when I walk away
Don’t you see the look on your face
Baby when I finish what you start
But I can’t hear a word you say
With a bullet laying in your heart
Damn love, how did this shit get out of my hands, love?
Lend you to rescue, say, damn love this shit is insane or insane girl
Ain’t that how we play
She loves me now, she loves me not
She loves me now but only when I walk away
She loves me now, she loves me not
She loves me now but only when I walk away
Only when I walk away
Ooh so cold
Only when I walk away
Ooh so cold
Only when I walk away
Ooh so cold
Only when I walk away
But only when I walk away
But only when I walk away
But only when I walk away
She loves me now, she loves me not
She loves me now but only when I walk away
She loves me now, she loves me not
She loves me now but only when I walk away
Only when I walk away
Only when I walk away
What am I gonna do with all this damn love
What am I gonna do with all this...
Only when I walk away
(hold up, hold up)
She only love me when I walk away
Call me at the phone and tell me baby do you stay
She only love me when I walk away
Call me out and begging, crying baby do you stay
She only love me when I walk away
Call me at the phone and tell me baby do you stay
She only love me when I walk away
Call me out and begging, crying baby do you stay
She only love me when I walk away
Call me at the phone and tell me baby do you stay
She only love me when I walk away
Call me out and begging, crying baby do you stay
She only love me when I walk away
Call me at the phone and tell me baby do you stay
She only love me when I walk away
Call me out and begging, crying baby do you stay
She only love me when I walk away
Call me at the phone and tell me baby do you stay
She only love me when I walk away
Call me out and begging, crying baby do you stay
I said you don’t get what you say
