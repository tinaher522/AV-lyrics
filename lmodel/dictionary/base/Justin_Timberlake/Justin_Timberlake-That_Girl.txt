<song artist="Justin_Timberlake" title="That_Girl">
You didn't have to run
I knew it was love from a mile away
But I had to catch ya
Been running through my mind all day baby
They all say I'm crazy cause anybody even when your father say
That I can't be with you
I don't hear a word they say
Cause I'm in love with that girl
So don't be mad at me
I'm in love with that girl
So don't be mad at me
So what you're from the other side of the tracks
So what the world don't think we match
I put it down like my love's on wax
Guess what, I'm in love with that girl
Well she told me
That she's in love with me
Now we didn't have to fall
But we fell in love to the bottom, babe
No one there to catch us like when you fell from heaven that day baby
People always staring but I don't even care nothin' about it babe
Cause since I saw your face I'm been staring just the same yeah hmm
Cause I'm in love with that girl
So don't be mad at me
I'm in love with that girl
So don't be mad at me
So what you're from the other side of the tracks
So what the world don't think we match
I put it down like my love's on wax
Guess what, I'm in love with that girl
Well she told me
That she's in love with me
My pretty lady,
You'll always be my baby baby baby,
It's so amazing how you became my baby baby baby
My little daisy, come here lemme rock you like a baby baby baby
Pretty lady, don't you know you'll always be my baby baby baby
Don't it seem like these days
That everybody's got something to say
But I don't pay attention to the talk babey
And I don't really care
If they stop and stare
I told you I'm in love with that girl
And she already told me she's in love with me
