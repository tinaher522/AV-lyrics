<song artist="Justin_Timberlake" title="I_Heard_Something">
I think i heard something the way ur body moves it makes me wanna do something
And ur 5.1 surround has got my speakerz bumpin
U drop it so hot but i need to hear ur bass bumpin
So turn the volume up and 
Shhhhhhh..
I think i heard something the way ur body moves it makes me wanna do something
And ur 5.1 surround has got my speakerz bumpin so go ahead and let me kno u aint afraid of nothin turn the volume up &amp;
Make ur body talk
La 22x
&amp; if ur body talk come on
La 22x
I need to hear ur body talk some more
Weezy Baby 
I can make her body talk to me 
I can make that thing jump off of her and walk to me 
Baby girl you're looking like a theme park to me 
I mean your looking like stars in the dark to me 
I feel like I'm on Mars and your apart from me 
Leonardo making love is an art for me 
New Gallardo kind of small but it works for me 
Baby doll I'm at your neck like a shirt button 
What'chu trying to do,twerk something 
I can make you feel good when it hurt honey 
Left you alone, the nerve of him 
Shhhh...I think i heard something
I think i heard something the way ur body moves it makes me wanna do something
And ur 5.1 surround has got my speakerz bumpin
U drop it so hot but i need to hear ur bass bumpin
So turn the volume up and 
Shhhhhhh..
I think i heard something the way ur body moves it makes me wanna do something
And ur 5.1 surround has got my speakerz bumpin so go ahead and let me kno u aint afraid of nothin turn the volume up &amp;
Make ur body talk
