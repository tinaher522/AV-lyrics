Yeah, suppose to have a remix
That's how you make one hit record
and then two (ha, ha, ha)
50 Cent, ggg..ggg..ggg..G-Unit!
I remember when you used to love me
you use to kiss and hug me,
I look into your eyes 
and get lost for a day,
you love me is what you told me
all that time you used to hold me
all I feel you slippin away...
- Justin Timberlake - (50 Cent)
You were my sun (wooh)
You were my earth, (a ha)
But you didn't know 
all the ways I loved you, no' (ggg..G-Unit!)
So you took a chance
And made other plans (yeah)
But I bet you didn't think 
that they would come crashing down, no' (Come on)
You don't have to say, what you did,
I already know, (ha ,ha, ha) I found out from him
Now there's just no chance, 
for you and me, there'll never be
And don't it make you sad about it
You told me you loved me (wooh)
Why did you leave me, all alone
Now you tell me you need me
When you call me, on the phone (uh huh, uh huh)
Girl I refuse, you must have me confused
With some other guy (yeah)
Your bridges were burned, and now it's your turn
To cry, cry me a river
Cry me a river-er
Cry me a river
Cry me a river-er, yeah yeah 
(Ahhhhh!)
I know that they say
That some things are better left unsaid (uh huh)
It wasn't like you only talked to him and you know it
[Don't act like you don't know it] (yeah)
And all of these things people told me
Keep messing with my head
[Messing with my head]
You should've picked honesty
Then you may not have blown it
[Yeah..] (wooh)
You don't have to say, what you did,
[Don't have to say, what you did]
I already know,(ha, ha, ha) I found out from him
[I already know, uh]
Now there's just no chance, (told her now)
for you and me, there'll never be
[No chance, you and me]
And don't it make you sad about it (uh huh)
You told me you loved me
Why did you leave me, all alone
[All alone] (said it)
Now you tell me you need me
When you call me, on the phone (uh huh, yeah)
[When you call me on the phone]
Girl I refuse, you must have me confused
With some other guy
[I'm not like them baby]
Your bridges were burned, and now it's your turn
[It's your turn]
To cry, 
cry me a river (uh huh, uh huh)
[Go on and just]
Cry me a river-er
[Go on and just]
Cry me a river
[Baby go on and just] (yeah)
Cry me a river-er,  yeah yeah (50 Cent)

If you know what I know, you know 
you ain't gotta say a word
its done in the dark, come to light
I'm feelin kick you to the curb,
you smile all up in my face,
girl you got a lotta nerve,
situation so absurd, 
you ain't special, you'se a burb
get your shit and hit the door 
you ain't welcome here no more
ain't no sense in seein' u cryin
girl you know i know you lyin
you must take me for a fool
thinkin im'a stay wit you
first, give me back my jewels,
Bitch, I ain't playin wit you
