Featuring justin timberlake

When I was younger, I never went too far
Held my feelings, I never even wanted to start
Til when I met you, I didn't know
What you were gonna do with my heart
When you talk. I hang on every word you say
When you move, you're like the breeze on a summer day
When you smile, the sky turns from gray to blue
That's what you do
And you're the kind of girl I think of
And you're the kind of girl I dream about
My heart is telling me I need you in my world
In my world
Cause you're my kind of lady
You're my kind of girl
When I'm not with you, wherever you are
Baby,I'm counting the moments til I'm back in your arms
All I want is to have you here with me every night, every day
When you talk, I hang on every word you say
When you move, you're like the breeze on a summer day
When you smile, the sky turns from gray to blue
That's what you do
And you're the kind of girl I think of
And you're the kind of girl I dream about
My heart is telling me I need you in my world
My world
Cause you're my kind of lady
You're my kind of girl
Baby girl, I need you here by my side
And If you're there everything will be alright
Cause this is the time for us (This is the time)
Baby, be mine! (Baby be mine)
And you're the kind of girl I think of (I think about)
And you're the kind of girl I dream about (The kind of girl I dream about
My heart is telling me I need you in my world
Cause you're my kind of lady
You're my kind of girl
My kind of girl
My kind of girl
My kind of girl (repeat)
