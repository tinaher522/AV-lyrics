Nelly:
Would you be my girlfriend? (uh, eh, eh)
uh, would you be my girl?
would you be my (would you be my girlfiend)
uh, eh, would you be my
check it, check it: he don't want you like I want you
believe me boo I done told, yeah
he don't appreciate you mom I can tell by the way he hold you
he dont love you like I do love you he don't squeeze you like I
squeeze
I make yo neck pop back and in fact i'll bubble yo knees
hey okay, baby, whats it gon' take for you to be my lady? (tell me
right now) 
I hear yo friends say you should, yo parents say he was good
yo lil sister kick y'all and helly I wish you would
but you're hesitating debatin' whether or not it's real
I ain't shootin' game through I'm just tellin' you how I feel
im thinkin everything about u yo hips and the way they sway
I hate to see you leave boo but I love to see you walk away
I be yo personal shrink boo I care what you think
I 'bout to billy and pink 'cause my doe *nsync
so tell yo man (bye bye) and tell him you long (gone)
and if he ain't waitin' of you then find you another (home)
Justin:
I don't know why you care (why you thinkin' about him mama?)
he doesn't even know you're there
'cause he don't love your eyes
and he don't love your smile
girl you know that ain't fair
the middle of the night, is he gonna be by your side
or will he run and hide
You don't know 'cause things ain't clear
and baby when you cry, is he gonna stand by your side
does the man even know you're alive
I got an idea
why don't you be my girlfriend
I'll treat ya good (ill treat ya good girl)
I know you hear your friends when they say you should
'cause if u were my girlfriend
I'd be your shining star
the one that show you where you are
girl you should be my girlfriend
does he know what ya feel (does he know what u feel?)
are you sure that it's real (are you sure?)
does he ease your mind (no)
or does he break your stride
did ya know that love could be a shield yeah
the middle of the night, is he gonna be by your side
or will he run and hide
you don't know 'cause things ain't clear
and baby when u cry, is he gonna stand by your side
does the man even know you're alive
I got an idea
Nelly:
would you be my girlfriend
I'll treat ya good
I know you hear your friends when they say you should
'cause if you were my girlfriend (uh, uh, uh, uh)
I'd be your shining star (I'd be the one that shine for ya girl)
the one that show you where you are (ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)
girl you should be my girlfriend
Nelly:
be my fianc√©e, cute as Beyonce
ghetto like da brat, ready to scrap when I say
talents of Alicia fall ms keys
I'll take yo hips off Trina, lips off Eve
I'll treat you so high on the better it might make yo nose bleed
sew yo dash around yo ankles and watch yo toes freeze
what's wrong momma? The man ain't bringin' you joy?
don't trip flip yo script to a country boy now c'mon
Justin:
ever since I saw your face
nothing in my life has been the same
I walk around just sayin' your name
without you my world would end
I've searched around this whole damn place
and everything says you were meant to be 
my girlfriend - oh!
Why don't you be my girlfriend yeah
I'll treat ya good
I know you hear your friends when they say you should
(I know you hear your friends when they say you should)
'cause if you were my girlfriend (my girlfriend)
I'd be your shining star
the one that show you where you are
girl you should be my girlfriend
Ahhh, ah, ahhh
(You make my heart sing)
Baby, baby, yeah
(You make my heart sing)
Ahhh, ah, ahhh
