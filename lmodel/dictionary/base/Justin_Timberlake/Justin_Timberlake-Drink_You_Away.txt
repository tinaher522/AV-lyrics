<song artist="Justin_Timberlake" title="Drink_You_Away">
Bitter sweet thing, could this be a dream
Or just the same nightmare that keeps me awake
Feel it in my brain, a tall shot of pain
I pour a little up now, for the love that we made
I feel it in the morning, you’re still here in the morning
I see you, but you gonna telephone the doctor, I’m not okay
The bottom of the bottle, to fill this empty heart up
A thousand proof don’t change the truth
I tried it, but I can’t
I can’t drink you away
I’ve tried Jack, I’ve tried Jim,
I’ve tried all of their friends
I can’t drink you away
All these rocks, I can’t swim out of this skin I'm livin' in, say
Now tell me, baby, don't they make a medicine for heart break
Ooh, no, tell me baby, oh yeah
Now don't they make a medicine for heart break
Got a pounding on my brain, so I drowned it away
When the sun comes up tomorrow
You can find me doing the same
'Cause I just can’t forget
The way we turned out this, babe
And now the only thing that sleeps here is a ghost of you instead
I feel it in the morning, you’re still here in the morning
I see you, but you gonna telephone the doctor, I’m not okay
The bottom of the bottle, to fill this empty heart up
A thousand proof don’t change the truth
I tried it, but I can’t
I can’t drink you away
I’ve tried Jack, I’ve tried Jim,
I’ve tried all of their friends
I can’t drink you away
All these rocks, I can’t swim out of this skin I'm livin' in, say
Now tell me, baby, don't they make a medicine for heart break
Ooh, no, tell me baby, oh yeah
Now don't they make a medicine for heart break
I can’t drink you, no I can’t drink you away, away
I can’t drink you, no I can’t drink you away, away
I can’t drink you, no I can’t drink you away, away
I can’t drink you, no I can’t drink you away, away, away
Oooh, I can’t drink you, I can’t drink you away
I can’t drink you away
I’ve tried Jack, I’ve tried Jim,
I’ve tried all of their friends
I can’t drink you away
All these rocks, I can’t swim out of this skin I'm livin' in, say
Now tell me, baby, don't they make a medicine for heart break
Ooh, no, tell me baby, oh yeah
Now don't they make a medicine for heart break
I can’t drink you away
I’ve tried Jack, I’ve tried Jim,
I’ve tried all of their friends
I can’t drink you away
All these rocks, I can’t swim out of this skin I'm livin' in, say
Now tell me, baby, don't they make a medicine for heart break
Ooh, no, tell me baby, oh yeah
Now don't they make a medicine for heart break
