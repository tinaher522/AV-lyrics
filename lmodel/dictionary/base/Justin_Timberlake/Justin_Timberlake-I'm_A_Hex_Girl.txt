<song artist="Justin_Timberlake" title="I'm_A_Hex_Girl">
I'm gonna cast a spell on you   
You're gonna do what I want you to
Mix it up here in my little bowl
Say a few words and you lose control!
(CHORUS)
I'm a Hex Girl! 
And I'm gonna put a spell on you  
(Gonna put a spell on you)
I'm a Hex Girl! 
And I'm gonna put a spell on you!
(Gonna put a spell on you  )
You'll feel the fog as I cloud your mind...
You'll get dizzy when I make a sign
You'll wake up in the dead of night
Missing me when I'm out of sight! 
(CHORUS) (Oh Yeah)
With this little cobweb potion
You'll fall into dark devotion
If you ever lose affection
I can change your whole direction
(CHORUS) 
WE'RE GONNA PUT A SPELL ON YOU!!!
