<song artist="Justin_Timberlake" title="If_I_Talk">
This is for the girls who get tipsy
But never get too drunk
This is for the girls who dance sexy
But never show too much
This is for the girls who get tipsy
But never get too drunk
This is for the girls who dance sexy
But never show too ...Stop
If I talk shit to you
Would you it talk back to me too...baby?
If I wanna dance with you
Would you wanna groove with me too...baby?
Cos' we can get it on all night long
It ain't nothing that caught yu baby
Cos' we can get it on all night long
It ain't nothing that caught ya baby
Arrive on set
I'm so fresh
Immediately get the other guys upset.
So fly that I aint gotta buy no jet
That's how I get their minds on sex
Make chicks sweat, literally yeah
They self so hot, and they're their thighs so wet
And I don't taste, no, I dont stress
Any girl I want, know I'm gun' get.
I can catch juliet, don't need no net.
Plenty fish in the sea, baby please know that.
And the dude that you with, 
Baby he's no threat.
His stacks on d's, my g's on deck.
What you want you recieve,
What you need you get,
Just give me one shot like russian roulette.
I must confess, i am obsessed.
Just gotta get up under her dress.
