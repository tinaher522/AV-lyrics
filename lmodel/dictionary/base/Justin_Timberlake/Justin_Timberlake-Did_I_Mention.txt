<song artist="Justin_Timberlake" title="Did_I_Mention">
Did I mention that I'm in love with you
And did I mention 
There's nothing I can do
And I happen to say
I dream of you everyday
But let me shout it out loud, if that's okay
HEY!
That's okay
HEY!
I met this girl that rocked my world like it's never rocked 
And now I'm living just for her and I won't ever stop
I never thought that it can happen to a guy like me
But now look at what you've done, you got me down on my knees.
Because my love for you is NASTINESS
I never knew
Who knew?
That it can be like this
My love for you is NASTINESS
My love is N-A-S-T-I-N-E-S-S
It's just...
And I would give my kingdom for just one kiss
Well, did I mention that I'm in love with you
And did I mention
There's nothing I can do
And did I happen to say
I dream of you everyday
And let me shout it out loud, if that's okay
YEAH
That's okay
YO!
I gotta know which way to go, c'mon gimme a sign
You gotta show me that you're only ever gonna be mine
Don't want to go another minute even without you
'Cause if your hear just isn't in it, I don't know what I'd do
Because my love for you is NASTINESS
I never knew
Who knew?
That it can be like this
My love for you is NASTINESS
My love is N-A-S-T-I-N-E-S-S
It's just...
And I would give my kingdom for just one kiss
