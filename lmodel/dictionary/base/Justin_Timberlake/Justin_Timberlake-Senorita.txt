Pharrell:
Ladies and gentlemen
Justin:

Pharrell:
It's my pleasure to introduce to you
He's a friend of mine
Justin:
Yes, yes I am
Pharrell:
And he goes by the name...
Justin
Whoa-ooh-ooh
All the way
from Memphis, Tennessee
And he got somethin' special for y'all tonight
He gon' sing a song for y'all
About this girl
Justin:
Come in right here?
Pharrell:
Yeah
Come on... uh
Justin:
On that sunny day
Didn't know I'd meet
Such a beautiful girl
Walking down the street
Seen those bright brown eyes
With tears coming down
Pharrell:
So he said to himself...
Justin:
She deserves a crown
But where is it now
Mama listen...
Chorus:
Senorita, I feel for you
You deal with things, that you don't have to
He doesn't love ya, I can tell by his charm
But you could feel this real love
If you just lay in my...
Running fast in my mind
Girl don't you slow it down
If we carry on this way
This thing might leave the ground
How would you like to fly?
That's how my queen should ride.
But you still deserve the crown
Why hasn't it been found?
Mama listen
Chorus:
Senorita, I feel for you
(Feel for you)
You deal with things, that you don't have to
(No, no)
He doesn't love ya, I can tell by his charm
(He don't love ya baby)
But you could feel this real love
(Feel it)
If you just lay in my...
Ah, ah, arms...
(Won't you lay in my)
Ah, ah, arms...
(Mama lay in my)
Ah, ah, arms...
(Baby won't you lay in my)
Ah, ah, arms...
When I look into your eyes (Just listen baby)
I see something that money can't buy (Just love me baby, oh)
And I know if you give us a try (I want you girl)
I'll work harder for you girl (Harder)
And no longer will you ever have to cry (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Chorus:
Senorita, I feel for you
You deal with things, that you don't have to
(Deal with things you don't have to)
He doesn't love ya, I can tell by his charm
(No, no)
But you could feel this real love
(Feel it)
If you just lay in my...
Ah, ah, arms...
(Whoa)
Ah, ah, arms...
(My baby)
Ah, ah, arms...
(Oooh, yea)
Ah, ah, arms...
When I look into your eyes (Dance with me baby)
I see something that money can't buy (Dance with me baby, oh)
And I know if you give us a try (I want you girl)
I'll work hard for you girl (harder)
You won't ever cry
Spoken:
Now listen
I wanna try some right now
See they don't do this anymore
I'ma sing something
And I want the guys to sing with me
They go
"It feels like something's heatin' up, can I leave with you?"
And then the ladies go
"I don't know but I'm thinkin' 'bout, really leavin' with you"
Guys sing
It feels like something's heatin' up, can I leave wit you?
And ladies
I don't know but I'm thinkin' 'bout, really leavin' wit you.
Feels good don't it, come on
It feels like something's heatin' up, can I leave with you?
Yea, ladies
I don't know but I'm thinkin' 'bout, really leavin' with you.
Sure feels good to me
Sing it one more time
It feels like something's heatin' up, can I leave wit you?
Ladies
I don't know but I'm thinkin' 'bout, really leavin' wit you.
Yea, yea..
It feels like something's heatin' up, can I leave wit you.?
Ladies
I don't know but I'm thinkin' 'bout, really leavin' with you.
Gentlemen, good night
Ladies, (laughs), good morning
And that's it
