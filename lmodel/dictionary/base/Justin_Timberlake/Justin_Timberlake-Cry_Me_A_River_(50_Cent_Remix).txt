She aint that chick from the burbs thats a stranger to drama,
Shes that uptown girl with the cocky persona.
Without a way to let her know that I  want her,
I told her I know for sure we belong together
And I wouldnt break her heart, my intentions ARE better,
And I shared the same dreams she had about cheddar.
When the G's came she was down to hold the bEretta,
I got a thing for baby girl, its me a her against the world,whoo!
-Justin-
You were my sun,
You were my earth,
But you didnt know all the ways I loved you,no.
So you took a chance,
Made OTHER planS,
But I bet you didnt think that they would come crashing down,no.
You dont have to say what you did,
I already know, I  found out from him!
Now theres just no chance for you and me,
We'll never be,
And dont it make you sad about it?
You told me you loved me,
Why did you leave me all alone?
Now you tell me you need me when you call me on the phone.
Well,girl, I refuse, you must have me confused
With some other guy.
Your bridges were burned,
Now its your turn to cry.
So cry my a river,
Go on and just cry me a river.
Cry me a river,
Go on and just cry me a river, yea yea...
I know that they say that some things are better left unsaid,
But it wasnt like you only talked to him and you know it!
(Dont act like you dont know it!)
All of these things people told me 
Keep messin' with my head.
You should have picked honesty,
Then you may not have blown it.
You dont have to say what you did,
I already know, I  found out from him!
Now theres just no chance for you and me,
We'll never be,
And dont it make you sad about it?
You told me you loved me,
Why did you leave me all alone?
Now you tell me you need me when you call me on the phone.
Well,girl, I refuse, you must have me confused
With some other guy.
Your bridges were burned,
Now its your turn to cry...
So cry my a river,
Go on and just cry me a river.
Cry me a river,
Go on and just cry me a river, yea yea.
-Timbaland-
Oh! The damage is done so I guess I'll be leavin.
Oh! The damage is done so I guess I'll be leavin.
Oh! The damage is done so I guess I'll be leavin.
Oh! The damage is done so I guess I'll be l-l-leavin.
You dont have to say what you did,
I already know, I  found out from him!
Now theres just no chance for you and me,
We'll never be,
And dont it make you sad about it?
So cry my a river
Go on and just cry me a river
Cry me a river
Go on and just cry me a river, yea yea

Your smile makes my day,
It's simple,your dimples,your eyes,
Your lips and thighs, got me hypnotized.
Communications deep,I love it when we talk,
I hate it when you leave,
But when you leave I love to watch you walk.
You make a nigga forget about a life full of drama,
She got expensive taste, she get it from her momma.
Materialistic,still a nigga wanna
Consistantly missin her touch when she gone,uh.
She smell like Channel,she feelin me and I can tell,
With the right woman by my side I feel like I can'T FAIL.
I've been around,up and down, my attitude is fuckin,
Yea she a rider I feel like Im in heaven when Im inside her.
Workin up the sweat kissin on her neck,
Twelve paly in the deck. 
Four play,corvette,have her drippin wet.
She lookin in my eyes and say she like it,
But I know she love it,
I just keep doin what Im doin and think nothing of it.
