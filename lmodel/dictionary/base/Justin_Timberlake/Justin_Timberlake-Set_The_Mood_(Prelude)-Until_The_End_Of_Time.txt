<song artist="Justin_Timberlake" title="Set_The_Mood_(Prelude)-Until_The_End_Of_Time">
Yeah, come here baby
And let me set the mood right
'Cause I'm gon' make you feel alright
Let me set the mood right
'Cause I'm gon' make you feel alright
I gotta set the mood right
Let me make you feel alright
I'm gon' set the mood right
I promise baby you'll feel alright
Ooh, yeah, ooh
Just let me set the mood right
Let me make you feel alright
'Cause I'm gon' set the mood right
Then you'll say my name tonight
After I set the mood right
I promise girl you'll feel alright
If you let me set the mood right
I'll make you feel so good tonight
Ooh, yeah
If it feels good to you
Gotta feel good to me
Let me set the mood right
Hey hey, oh yeah
Listen
I woke up this morning
And heard the TV sayin' something
About disaster in the world and
It made me wonder where I'm going
There's so much darkness in the world
But I see beauty left in you girl
And what you give me lets me know
That I'll be alright
'Cause if your love was all I had in this life
Well that would be enough until the end of time
So rest your weary heart and relax your mind
'Cause I'm gonna love you girl until the end of time
You've got me singin' oh yeah, oh yeah
Everybody sing oh yeah
Everybody singin' oh yeah
No if you're ever wonderin'
About the way I'm feelin'
Well baby girl there ain't no question
Just to be around you is a blessin'
Sick and tired of tryin' to save the world
I just wanna spend my time with you girl
And what you give me lets me know
That we'll be alright
'Cause if your love was all I had in this life
Don't you know that that would be enough until the end of time
So rest your weary heart and relax your mind
'Cause I'm gonna love you girl until the end of time
You've got me singin' oh yeah, oh yeah
Everybody sing oh yeah
Everybody singin' oh yeah
This one's for the lovers
If you're out there let me hear you say
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah
This one's for the lovers
If you're out there let me hear you say
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
This one's for the lovers
If you're out there let me hear you say
Yeah yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah
This one's for the lovers
If you're out there let me hear you say
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Take it back one time
Oh yeah
Oh ooh
Whoa whoa yeah
Oh ooh
'Cause if your love was all I had in this life
That would be enough until the end of time
