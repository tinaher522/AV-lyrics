<song artist="Justin_Timberlake" title="Deeply">
You ask is my loving you,
All I can say is how I feel,
Deeply, deeply as can be.
You seem to need to know
How I would want if you would go,
Deeply, down inside of me.
Is our love forever?
Can anyone ever know?
For all I remember I never have felt love so,
So deeply, deeply.
Our love is made by two
And I can't make it without you,
Deeply, I feel so deeply for our love.
Is our love forever?
Can anyone ever know?
For all I remember I never have felt love so,
So deeply, deeply, deeply, deeply for our love.
