<song artist="Justin_Timberlake" title="Sexy_Ladies_(Remix)">
Shorty when ya come over
I know just what to do girl to make u feel right
Ya know I know ya
Don't come be a freak for me when ya come tonight
I wanna show ya
Things u ain't never seen girl your just my type
Ya know I know ya
Don't come do all the things u know I like
I want u to show me what you know baby
But I'm a teach you new tricks
Introduce you to my ghetto karmasutricks
Close ya eyes, imagine being stress-free
Open ya eyes between ya thighs, baby that's me
When I push the pressure to pleasure it's so hard to measure
U leave me on ya mind cause nobody do it better
The intensity so real, damn shorty hold still
Then it's back to the action baby u know the drill
I can tell you want girl
You ain't gotta worry no more
You keep my bottles cold and you pop 'em
As soon as I walk in the door
These dude don't know me from Adam and Eve
That's why they can't mess up my flow
And when this beat drops, your heart stops
You feel it from your head to your toes
If you know what I'm talking 'bout
Let me see you work it out
Girl that's what I'm talking 'bout
I got sexy ladies all over the floor
You're talking to one of the greatest
Who did it before
Now I'm back with one of my latest
Just letting you know
That I got sexy ladies so back up some more
Let me take it off
I know a little girly from uptown
Just waiting just to cater to me
I know a little betty from downtown
That'll do anything that I please
All my other people that dance around
When they hear me rocking the groove
Now it might sound cocky
But is it really cocky if you know that it's true
If you know what I'm talking 'bout
Let me see you work it out
Girl that's what I'm talking 'bout
I got sexy ladies all over the floor
You're talking to one of the greatest
Who did it before
Now I'm back with one of my latest
Just letting you know
That I got sexy ladies so back up some more
And let me take it off
Sexy, sexy, sexy
Walk that body, talk that body
Sexy, sexy, sexy
Walk that body, talk that body
Sexy, sexy, sexy
Walk that body, talk that body
Sexy, sexy, sexy
Walk that body, talk that body
Give it to me baby, c'mon give it to me baby
Now baby c'mon give me some more
I said give it to me baby, c'mon give it to me baby
Now baby c'mon give me some more
Give it to me missionary, doggy-style, cowgirl, lowwhile
Kissing it below the neck, everything drippin' wet
Latex safe sex, ya I do that correct
Like that as much as I like that baby ya I bet
Sexy, sexy, sexy
Walk that body, talk that body
(Slow down girl)
Sexy, sexy, sexy
Walk that body, talk that body
(Slow down girl)
Sexy, sexy, sexy
Walk that body, talk that body
(Slow down girl)
Sexy, sexy, sexy
Walk that body
I got sexy ladies all over the floor
You're talking to one of the greatest
Who did it before
Now I'm back with one of my latest
Just letting you know
That I got sexy ladies so back up some more
And let me take it off
