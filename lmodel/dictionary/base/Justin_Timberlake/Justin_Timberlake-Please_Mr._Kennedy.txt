<song artist="Justin_Timberlake" title="Please_Mr._Kennedy">
One second please!
Please Mr. Kennedy (Uh oh!)
I don't wanna go (please don't shoot me into outer space)
P-P-Please Mr. Kennedy (Uh oh!)
I don't wanna go (please don't shoot me into outer space)
I sweat when they stuff me in the pressure suits
Bubble helmet, Flash Gordon boots
Nowhere up there in gravity zero (outer, space)
I need to breathe, don't need to be a hero (outer, space)
Are you reading me loud and clear?
Oh!
Please Mr. Kennedy (Uh oh!)
I don't wanna go (please don't shoot me into outer space)
P-P-Please Mr. Kennedy (Uh oh!)
I don't wanna go (please don't shoot me into outer space)
I'm six-foot two, and so perhaps you'll
Tell me how to fit into a five foot capsule
I won't be known as man of the century
If I burn up upon reentry
Gotta red-blooded wife with a healthy libido
You'll lose her vote if you make her a widow
And who'll play catch out in the back with our kid?
Oh!
Please Mr. Kennedy (Uh oh!)
I don't wanna go (please don't shoot me into outer space)
Countdown!
Oh no!
Please Mr. Kennedy (Uh oh!)
I don't wanna go (please don't shoot me into outer space)
Please (oh please!)
Please (oh please!)
Please (oh please!)
Please don't shoot me into outer space!
Please (oh please!)
Please (oh please!)
Please don't shoot me into outer space!
Please Mr. Kennedy!
