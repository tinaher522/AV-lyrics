<song artist="Justin_Timberlake" title="Now_She's_Gone">
She was a popstar,
younger than me,
Never and ugly girl,
But a beauty queen
(Chorus)
Oh girl,
I really wanna touch you,
I really wanna kiss you,
Till the day has gone oooooh
I never imagined,
That she would leave like this,
Oh Britney help me,
I need to take a piss
