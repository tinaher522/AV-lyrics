<song artist="Justin_Timberlake" title="I'm_Sorry">
I'm Sorry
Can someone tell me why I always hurt you
'Cause honestly, I just dont understand
You would've given me the world, if i asked
But now I'll never have that chance again
I miss the way you made me smile
And how you looked into my eyes
I wish I couldn take back all those things I said
But now all I can do is apologize
But that's not enough..
(Chorus)
You loved me, I left you
I'm crying, 'cause I need you
I miss you, but you're gone now
And it's my fault, and I'm alone now         
I'm sorry, I'm sorry
