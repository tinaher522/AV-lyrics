[Stat Quo:]
You lookin' like the type I like to be wit
Sexy then a mug excuse me miss
You belong the flicks
I'm loving your ass and hips
I wanna workin' like the 905 on the strip
Can ya boy get a hit
Lord know you the shit
They might creep
You don't wanna wanna be quick
I satisfied you baby
You won't wanna slip
But nice sit back relax
Let JT spit
Justin singin'
Yeah!
[Justin Timberlake:]
Ridin' in the drop top with the top down
Saw you switchin' lanes girl
Pull up to the red light, lookin' right 
Come here, let me get your name girl
Tell me where you from, what you do, what you like
Let me pick your brain girl
And tell me how they got that pretty little face on that pretty little frame girl
But let me show you 'round, let me take you out
Bet you we could we could have some fun girl
'Cause we can do it fast (fast), slow, whichever way you wanna run girl
But let me buy you drinks, better yet rings
Do it how you want it done girl
And who would've thought that you could be the one 'cause I
[Chorus:]
I can't wait to fall in love with you
You can't wait to fall in love with me
This just can't be summer love, you'll see
This just can't be summer love (L-O-V-E)
[Justin Timberlake:]
Come on and lemme show you 'round
Let me take you out, bet you we could have some fun girl

'Cause we can dress it up, we can dress it down 
Any way you want it done girl
Or we can stay home, talkin' on the phone
Rappin' 'til we see the sun girl
Do what I gotta do, just gotta show you that I'm the one girl
Well I'mma freak you right, each and every night
I know how to do it insane girl
'Cause I can make it hot, make it stop
Make you wanna say my name girl
Come on baby please 'cause I'm on my knees
Can't get you off my brain girl
But who would've thought that you could be the one 'cause I
[Chorus:]
I can't wait to fall in love with you
You can't wait to fall in love with me
This just can't be summer love, you'll see
This just can't be summer love (L-O-V-E)
'Cause I can't wait to fall in love with you
You can't wait to fall in love with me
This just can't be summer love, you'll see
This just can't be summer love (L-O-V-E)
[Bridge:]
The summer's over for the both of us
But that doesn't mean we should give up on love
You're the one I've been thinking of
And I knew the day I met you you'd be the one
[Stat Quo:]
Can you picture us?
Cruisin' in a drop top let the song not like you know fame babe
Hand on ya back see you get hot cause a phenom get that fame babe
Dip 'til you creep you know what it is, I'ma make you say my name babe
Do you like you'll never be dumb before I dryin' low and cra-zy
Yeah!
[Chorus:]
I can't wait to fall in love with you
You can't wait to fall in love with me
This just can't be summer love, you'll see
This just can't be summer love (L-O-V-E)
'Cause I can't wait to fall in love with you
You can't wait to fall in love with me
This just can't be summer love, you'll see
This just can't be summer love (L-O-V-E)
