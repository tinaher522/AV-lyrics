Future
Sex
Love
Sound
You know what you want, yeah
And that makes you just like me
See, everybody says you're hot, baby
But can you make it hot for me?
Said, if you're thinking about holding back
Don't worry, girl
'Cause I'm gonna make it so easy
So slide a little bit closer to me, little girl
See, daddy's on a mission to please
Wait a second
[Chorus]
She's hopped up for me
I've got her in my zone
Her body's pressed up on me
I think she's ready to blow
Must be my future
Sex, love sound
And when it goes down
Baby, all you got to do is
Just tell me which way you like that
Tell me which way you like that
Do you like it like this?
Do you like it like that?
Tell me which way you like that
Tell me which way you like that
You can't stop, baby
You can't stop once you've turned me on
And your enemies are your thoughts, baby
So just let 'em go
'Cause all I need is a moment alone
To give you my tongue
And put you outta control
And after you let it in, we'll be skin to skin
It's just so natural
Wait a second
[Chorus]
Just tell me which way you like that
Tell me which way you like that
Do you like it like this?
Do you like it like that?
Just tell me which way you like that
Tell me which way you like that
Future, sex, love, sound
Future, sex, love, sound
Future, sex, love, sound
Future, sex, love, sound
Wait a second
[Chorus]
Just tell me which way you like that
Tell me which way you like that
Do you like it like that?
Tell me which way you like that
Tell me which way you like that
