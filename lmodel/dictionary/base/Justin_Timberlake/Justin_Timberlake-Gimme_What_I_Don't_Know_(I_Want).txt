Sound's a calm, when we become the animals that we're made in the jungle
Why you staying so far away?
Running men is looking on, why
Why don't you come out to play
And get closer to your animal, inside
Ready I like the gentleman that your mother love, ooh get to me
Baby you act like a lady, don't have to cover it up, things you wanna show me
Make me remember the reason why I wanted to love, please be slowly
I think you're ready to try, walk a little closer and...
Now take me to your jungle, I'm not afraid
And if you're looking for your animal, hop in my cage
Fall in a terror of height, don't talk
Come in, come in, baby what I don't know, I want
Come in, come in, baby what I don't know, I want
Come in, come in, baby what I don't know, I want
Come in, come in, baby what I don't know, don't know, I want
Come in, come in, baby what I don't know, I want
Show me your t-shirt, and sweat your sling
Down and dirty, you're loving me so loud
Play it breeze, but you wild as a strain
Sorry show it for the whole crowd
Ready I like the gentleman that your mother love, ooh get to me
Baby you act like a lady, don't have to cover it up, things you wanna show me
Make me remember the reason why I wanted to love, please be slowly
I think you're ready to try, walk a little closer and...
Now take me to your jungle, I'm not afraid
And if you're looking for your animal, hop in my cage
Fall in a terror of height, don't talk
Come in, come in, baby what I don't know, I want
Come in, come in, baby what I don't know, I want
Come in, come in, baby what I don't know, I want
Come in, come in, baby what I don't know, don't know, I want
Come in, come in, baby what I don't know, I want
Sound's a calm, when we become the animals that we're made in the jungle
Now take me to your jungle, I'm not afraid
And if you're looking for your animal, hop in my cage
Fall in a terror of height, don't talk
Come in, come in, baby what I don't know, I want
Come in, come in, baby what I don't know, I want
Come in, come in, baby what I don't know, I want
Come in, come in, baby what I don't know, don't know, I want
Come in, come in, baby what I don't know, I want
Sound's a calm, when we become the animals that we're made in the jungle
Come in, come in, baby what I don't know, I want
Come in, come in, baby what I don't know, I want
Come in, come in, baby what I don't know, I want
Come in, come in, baby what I don't know, don't know, I want
Come in, come in, baby what I don't know, I want
