<song artist="Justin_Timberlake" title="Come_And_Touch">
Ow oh oh oh oh yeah
Oh you're already here
Haven't seen you for a couple of days
So let me tell you something
And when I start taking my clothes off 
Touching myself and taking a shower 
I wanna be alone and I dont need a girl 
To feel the way I wanna feel 
And I dont want you to feel the way I feel
I just wanna have some fun with a couple of guys 
My touch is just a body language
So exciting so inviting
Wanna go I just need oh
And when I say so you say no 
And when I say no you say so 
Just better you would say 
Hey baby boy you're sexy 
But you keep saying 
You're a little bit sassy 
Sissy boy come to me 
Oh you melt in my arm like a butter ah
(Chorus)
Tryin' to keep you
Don't want you to disappear
Just tryin' to catch your smell
Your voice is just so mellow
Why are your steps so..? Hallow!
Dont know if you're a girl
And I don't even care
Come and touch touch me closer
One more time twice
I don't wanna dance
Make no scence
Do you hear my lamentation?
How? Keep me in your arms
Just put your hand on my chest
And tell me what you feel
Just look in my eyes
And tell me what you see
That silence between us will be for a while
And you know what I mean
And you know what I have seen
Haven't seen you for a couple of days
So let me tell you something
Let me touch you with my finger tips
Let me shake my hips
Am I about lips?
Chocolate sticks
Just lose control
And follow my lead
(Chorus 2x)
Come closer closer yo come closer
