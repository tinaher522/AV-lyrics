<song artist="Justin_Timberlake" title="Words_I_Say">
Sometimes i can't believe what i am seeing
But i always see love that you are giving to me
And i still don't know what lead me to you
But i know this, this was meant to be
And girl in your smile i see my everything
Chorus
But if the words i say
Make the tears roll down
And they find their way to your heart down
Your lips can say enough
The tongue controls my mouth
And over this .. Is that
In the corners of your mouth
Tu tu tu tu
Sometimes i can't believe the things i say to you
But baby every word is true yes it is
And when you kiss me it's all over
You put me under i didn't know that love can hurt so good
And girl in your smile i see my everything
Chorus
But if the words i say
Make the tears roll down
And they find their way to your heart down
Your lips can say enough
The tongue controls my mouth
And over this .. Is that
In the corners of your mouth
