<song artist="Creed" title="Suddenly">
A nature to nurture - An instinct to sin
What's under me? - The skin you live in
You trade your unlimited, your precious creation
You will submit - You will get it
[Chorus]
Suddenly I have no strength at all
So suddenly hit with all I've lost
Suddenly my world, is falling apart
So suddenly, (x2) ...Suddenly
You say you're a victim,
But that's just a symptom
You're so very clear - You volunteered
Why are you fighting just stop your denying?
Own up to the sin you bury within
[Chorus]
I have no strength at all
I've been hit with a loss
So suddenly my world falls apart  (repeat)
...My world falls apart
[Chorus]  /  [Chorus (alt)]
-(alt: line 2 = "So suddenly hit, (x2)")-
