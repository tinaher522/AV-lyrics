<song artist="Creed" title="In_America">
Only in America - We're slaves to be free
Only in America -
We kill the unborn to make ends meet
Only in America - Sexuality is democracy
Only in America - 
We stamp our gold, "In God We Trust"
[Chorus]
What is right or wrong?
I don't know who to believe in
My soul sings a different song,
In America  (repeat)
...In America, (x2)
Church bells ringin' - Pass the plate around
The choir is singin' -
As their leader falls to the ground
Please Mr. Prophet-man -
Tell me which way to go...
I gave my last dollar -
Can I still come to your show?
[Chorus]  ...In America, (x3)
...I said, Oh, (x3)  ...Yeah
I am right, and you are wrong  (x3)
No one's right, and no one's wrong
In America... (x4)
[Chorus]  ...In America, (x2)
...What is right for you and me?
...Yeah, in America
