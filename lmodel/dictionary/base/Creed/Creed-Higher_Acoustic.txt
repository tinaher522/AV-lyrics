<song artist="Creed" title="Higher_Acoustic">
When dreaming
I'm guided through another world time and time again
At sunrise
I fight to stay asleep 'cause I don't wanna leave the comfort of this place
'Cause there's a hunger and a longing to escape
The life I live when I'm awake
So let's go there, let's make our escape
C'mon let's go there, let's ask can we stay
Can you take me higher
To a place where blind men see?
Can you take me higher
To a place with golden streets?
Although I would like the world to change
It helps me to appreciate those nights and those dreams
But my friend I'd sacrifice all those nights
If I could only make the earth and my dreams the same
The only difference is to let love
Replace all our hate
So let's go there, let's make our escape
C'mon let's go there, let's ask can we stay
Can you take me higher
To a place where blind men see?
Can you take me higher
To a place with golden streets?
So let's go there, let's make our escape
C'mon let's go there, let's ask can we stay
Up high I feel like I'm alive for the very first time
Up high I'm strong enough to take these dreams and make them mine
Can you take me higher
To a place where blind men see?
Can you take me higher
To a place with golden streets?
Can you take me higher
To a place where blind men see?
Can you take me higher
To a place with golden streets?
