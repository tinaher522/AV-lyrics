<song artist="Creed" title="Is_This_The_End?_(Acoustic)">
The rage in my eyes
Could have compared to the eye of a sun 
Then rain Took it's course through the hands of the Son
Repent for all time
The world is at war leaving all fault behind
So is this the end for us my friend?
So is this the end for us my friend?
The stains in the sky
Are there to remind us of man and his fight
When two worlds collide
One steals the life like a thief in the night
So look to the sky
He hold the keys for your life and mine
So is this the end for us my friend?
So is this the end for us my friend?
So is this the end for us my friend?
Well as though we rise
As the day breaks the dawn
And as the moon hides the sun
Oh, the sun
No more sorrow
All those crying days are gone
No more sorrow, now it's gone
Now it's gone
Now it's gone
So is this the end for us my friend?
So is this the end for us my friend?
So is this the end for us my friend?
So is this the end for us my friend?
