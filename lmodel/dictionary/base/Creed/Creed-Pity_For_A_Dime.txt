<song artist="Creed" title="Pity_For_A_Dime">
An artificial season,
Covered by Summer rain...
Losing all my reason,
'Cause there's nothing left to blame...
Shadows paint the sidewalk,
A living picture in a frame...
See the sea of people,
All their faces look the same...
So I sat down for a while - Forcing a smile
In a state of self denial - Is it worth while?
Sell my pity for a dime - Yeah, just one dime
Sell my pity for a dime - Yeah, just one dime
Plain - Talk can be the easy way
Signs - Of losin' my faith, losin' my faith  (repeat)
[Chorus]
So I sat down for a while - Yeah, forcing a smile
In a state of self denial - Yeah, is it worth while?
Sell my pity for a dime - Yeah, just one dime
Sell my pity for a dime - Yeah, just one dime
[Bridge]
Sellin', sellin', my pity for a dime,
An' another man take my soul...
[Chorus]  /  [Bridge]
