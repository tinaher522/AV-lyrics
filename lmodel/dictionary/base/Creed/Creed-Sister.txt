<song artist="Creed" title="Sister">
Caught up in the middle
Had no choice - Had no choice
Birthright forgotten - So silent, no voice
[Pre Chorus]
I see you - You know who
Little Sister - Little Sister...
-Now realize, little sister
-Overlooked, little girl  (- repeat)
[Chorus]
Bottled up &amp; empty hole, am I
Unless you've forgotten,
Get back, get back... (repeat)
Get back, get back, yeah...
Expectations of another
Love given to the younger
Broken Father - Broken Brother,
Emptiness feeds the hunger
[Pre Chorus]  /  [Chorus]
Now realized - Little Sister
Overlooked, little girl...
No direction - Little Sister
Overlooked, little girl
...Change, (x3)
