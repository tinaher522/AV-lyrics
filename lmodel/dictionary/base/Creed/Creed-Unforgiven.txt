<song artist="Creed" title="Unforgiven">
I kept up with the prophecy you spoke
I kept up with the message inside
Lost sight of the irony of twisted faith
Lost sight of my soul and it's void
Think I, think I'm unforgiven to this world  (x2)
...Yeah
Took a chance at deceiving myself
To share in the consequence of lies
Childish with my reasoning and pride
Godless to the extent that I died
Think I, think I'm unforgiven to this world  (x2)
...Think I'm unforgiven
No more raging innocence  (x4)
Step inside the light and see
The fear of God burn inside of me
The gold was put to flame
To kill, to burn, to mold it's purity
Think I, think I'm unforgiven to this world  (x2)
...Think I'm unforgiven
