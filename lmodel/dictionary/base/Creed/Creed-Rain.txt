<song artist="Creed" title="Rain">
Can you help me out, can you lend me a hand?
It's safe to say that I'm stuck again
Trapped between this life and the light,
I just can't figure out, how to make it right
[Pre-Chorus]
A thousand times before,
I've wondered if there's - something more, (x2)
I feel it's gonna' rain like this for days
So let it rain down and wash everything away
I hope that tomorrow the Sun will shine
With every tomorrow comes another life
I feel it's gonna' rain, for days and days
-(I feel it's gonna rain)-
I tried to figure out, I can't understand
What it means to be whole again
Trapped between the truth &amp; the consequence
Nothing's real, nothing's making sense
[Pre-Chorus]...
[Chorus v2]:
I feel it's gonna' rain like this for days
So let it rain down and wash everything away
I hope that tomorrow the sun will shine
I feel it's going to - rain like this, (x3)
Fall down - Wash away my yesterdays
Fall down - So let the rain fall down on me
...[Chorus]  ...So let the rain fall
I feel it's gonna' rain like this, rain like this
So let the rain fall down
I feel it's gonna' rain like this
I feel it's gonna' rain
