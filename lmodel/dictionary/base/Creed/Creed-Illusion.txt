<song artist="Creed" title="Illusion">
The Sun rises to another day,
My constitution keeps changing, 'til it slips away
So I lie awake and stare - My mind thinking,
Just wondering, does anybody care?
-(He says, "Does anybody care?")-
[Chorus]
Should I stay or go?
Should I sleep or stay awake?
Am I really happy, or is it all just an illusion?
Sitting in my room now - Hiding thoughts,
Just hoping one day I'll get out
I hear a voice call my name,
Breaking trance, so silent,
So I can stay the same
[Chorus]
Wait now, many things left unsaid
This life remains the same, but I change
I try to fool myself in believing
Things are going to get better, but life goes on
[Chorus]  ...Just an illusion, (x7)
