<song artist="Creed" title="Who's_Got_My_Back?">
Run, hide
All that was sacred to us
Sacred to us
See the signs
The covenant has been broken
By mankind
Leaving us with no shoulder
With no shoulder
To rest our head on
To rest our head on
To rest our head on
Who's got my back now?
When all we have left is deceptive
So disconnected
What is the truth now?
What is the truth now?
There's still time
All that has been devastated
Can be recreated
Realize
We pick up the broken pieces
Of our lives
Giving ourselves to each other
Ourselves to each other
To rest our head on
To rest our head on
To rest our head on
Who's got my back now?
When all we have left is deceptive
So disconnected
What is the truth now?
Who's got my back now?
When all we have left is deceptive
So disconnected
What is the truth now?
What is the truth now?
Tell me the truth now
What is the truth now?
What is the truth now?
Tell us the truth
Who's got my back now?
When all we have left is deceptive
So disconnected
What is the truth now?
Who's got my back now?
When all we have left is deceptive
So disconnected
What is the truth now?
What is the truth now?
Tell us the truth now
What is the truth now?
Tell us the truth now
Tell me the truth now
