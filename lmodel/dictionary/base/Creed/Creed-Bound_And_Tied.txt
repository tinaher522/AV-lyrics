<song artist="Creed" title="Bound_And_Tied">
Toung-tied, wrist wrist, and wanting
Looks like you might bite, you might bite
Breathin in, breathin out, you're weakened
The poison's hit your mind, your mind.
Time's ticking and its got ya thinking,
You're happy with your life, your life
You're cheated, slated and singled out
By all those chains that bind, that bind
Take a trip, plane my way lately
Cause now you are mine, you are mine
This airplane's goin my way
Cause now you're bound and tied
You're bound and tied
You're bound and tied
Now sit and reflect on all the fame
Time to dim your light, your light
Zoomin in, zoomin out, you're questioning,
For that there is no crime, no crime
You're cheated, slated and singled out,
By all those chains that bind, that bind
Take a trip plane my way lately
Cause now you are mine, you are mine
This airplane's goin my way
Cause now you're bound and tied
You're bound and tied
You're bound and tied
And we fly...we fly...we fly
And we fly...we fly...we fly
And we fly...and we fly....away, away
Bound and tied, bound and tied
You're Bound and Tied
Bound and tied, bound and tied
You're Bound and Tied
Bound and tied, bound and tied
You're Bound and Tied
