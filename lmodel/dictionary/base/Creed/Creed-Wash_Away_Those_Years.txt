<song artist="Creed" title="Wash_Away_Those_Years">
She came calling one early morning
She showed her crown of thorns
She whispered softly to tell a story
About how she had been wronged
As she lay lifeless
He stole her innocence
And this is how she carried on
This is how she carried on
Well, I guess she closed her eyes
And just imagined everything's alright
But she could not hide her tears
'Cause they were sent to wash away those years
They were sent to wash away those years
My anger's violent but still I'm silent
When tragedy strikes at home
I know this decadence is shared by millions
Remember you're not alone
Remember you're not alone
Well, if you just close your eyes
And just imagine everything's alright
But do not hide your tears
'Cause they were sent to wash away those years
Well, if you just close your eyes
And just imagine everything's alright
But do not hide your tears
'Cause they were sent to wash away those years
They were sent to wash away those years
Maybe, we can wash away those moon's
For we have crossed many oceans
And we labor in between
In life there are many quotients
And I hope I find the mean's
The mean's, the mean's
Well, if you just close your eyes
And just imagine everything's alright
But do not hide your tears
'Cause they were sent to wash away those years
Well, if you just close your eyes
And just imagine everything's alright
But do not hide your tears
'Cause they were sent to wash away those years
Maybe, we can wash away those years
I hope that you can wash away those years
