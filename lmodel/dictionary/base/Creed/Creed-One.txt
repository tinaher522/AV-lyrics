<song artist="Creed" title="One">
Affirmative may be justified
Take from one, give to another
The goal is to be unified
Take my hand, be my brother
The payment silenced the masses
Sanctified by oppression
Unity took a back seat
Sliding further into regression
One, oh one
The only way is one
One, oh one
The only way is one
I feel angry I feel helpless
Want to change the world yeah
I feel violent I feel alone
Don't try to change my mind no
Society blind by color
Why hold down one, to raise another?
Discrimination now on both sides
Seeds of hate blossom further
The world is headed for mutiny
When all we want is unity
We may rise and fall, but in the end,
We'll meet our fate together
One, oh one
The only way is one
One, oh one
The only way is one
I feel angry I feel helpless
Want to change the world yeah
I feel violent I feel alone
Don't try to change my mind no
I feel angry I feel helpless
Want to change the world yeah
I feel violent I feel alone
Don't try to change my mind no
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
I feel angry I feel helpless
Want to change the world yeah
I feel violent I feel alone
Don't try to change my mind no
I feel angry I feel helpless
Want to change the world yeah
I feel violent I feel alone
Don't try to change my mind no
