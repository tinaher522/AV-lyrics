<song artist="Creed" title="Don't_Stop_Dancing">
At times life is wicked and I just can't see the light
A silver lining sometimes isn't enough to make some wrongs seem right
Whatever life brings
I've been through everything
And now I'm on my knees again
But I know I must go on
Although I hurt I must be strong
Because inside I know
That many feel this way
Children
Don't stop dancing
Believe you can fly
Away
Away
At times life's unfair and you know it's plain to see
Hey God I know I'm just a dot in this world, have You forgot about me?
Whatever life brings
I've been through everything
And now I'm on my knees again
But I know I must go on
Although I hurt I must be strong
Because inside I know
That many feel this way
Children
Don't stop dancing
Believe you can fly
Away
Away
Am I hiding in the shadows?
Forget the pain and forget the sorrows
Am I hiding in the shadows?
Forget the pain and forget the sorrows
But I know I must go on
Although I hurt I must be strong
Because inside I know
That many feel this way
Children
Don't stop dancing
Believe you can fly
Away
Away
Children
Don't stop dancing
Believe you can fly
Away
Away
Children
Don't stop dancing
Believe you can fly
Away
Away
Am I hiding in the shadows?
Are we hiding in the shadows?
