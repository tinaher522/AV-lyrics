<song artist="Creed" title="Signs">
This is not about age
Time served on the earth doesn't mean you grow in mind
Grow in mind
This is not about God
Spiritual insinuations seem to shock our nation
Our nation yeah
Come with me
I'm fading underneath the lights
Come with me
Come with me
Come with me now
This is not about race
It's a decision to stop the division in your life
In our lives
This is not about sex
We all know sex sells and the whole world is buying
We're buying yeah
Come with me
I'm fading underneath the lights
Come with me
Come with me
Come with me now
Can't you see the signs?
See the signs now
Can't you see the signs?
See the signs now
Can't you see the signs?
See the signs now
Can't you see the signs?
See the signs now
Can't you see the signs?
See the signs now
Can't you see the signs?
See the signs now
Now
Come on
Yeah!
Come with me
I'm fading underneath the lights
Come with me
Come with me
Come with me now
Can't you see them?
See the signs
You see them
All the signs we see them
Can't you see them?
See the signs
You see them
All the signs we see them
