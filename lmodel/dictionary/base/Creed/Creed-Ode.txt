<song artist="Creed" title="Ode">
Hang me, watch a while
Let me see you smile, as I die...
Take me, as my body burns
Let me see you yearn, while I cry...
[Chorus]
One step on your own,
And you walk all over me
One head in the clouds,
You won't let go - You're too proud
One light to the blind,
-(And they see)-  And you walk all over me
One touch on the head,
-(And you believe)-  And we believe
Adore me, as I drift away
Let me hear you say, "I'm fine"...
You cry, as my body dies
All that you despised, is gone away...
[Chorus]  ...We believe
Yeah... [Chorus]  ...We believe
