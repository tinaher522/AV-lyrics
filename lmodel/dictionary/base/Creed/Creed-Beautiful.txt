<song artist="Creed" title="Beautiful">
She wears a coat of color
Loved by some, feared by others
She's immortalized, in young men's eyes
Lust she breeds in the eyes of brothers
Violent sons, make bitter mothers
Close your eyes, here's your surprise
[Chorus]
But beautiful is empty - Beautiful is free
Beautiful loves no one - Beautiful stripped me
Stripped me, (x2), She stripped me
In your mind, she's your companion
Vile instincts, often candid
Your regret, is all that's left
[Chorus]
She told me where I'm going,
And it's far away from home
I think I'll go there on my own, (x2)  (repeat)
[Chorus]  ...She stripped me ...Stripped me
