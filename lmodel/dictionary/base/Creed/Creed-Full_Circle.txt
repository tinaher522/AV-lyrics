<song artist="Creed" title="Full_Circle">
Got your freedom now, boy, who do you serve?
Took for granted what you should have preserved
No time left, (x2), to make amends
Keep burning bridges,
While you're buying your new friends
[Pre-Chorus]
A day of reflection hits,
You're a shell - Skin and bones
Counting costs - Is it worth your soul?
A day of reflection hits
[Chorus]
It's funny how times can change, rearrange
And distance makes the pain fade away
So important then - Doesn't matter now
Both feet on the ground - Come full circle
...Yeah, come full circle
No access granted now, boy, you've been denied
Jump a fence to see what's on the other side
Are you wanted?, (x2) ...The question is,
Could 2nd chances mean another impression?
[Pre-Chorus]  /  [Chorus]  ...We've come full circle
I got one foot stuck in Heaven,
Yeah, one boot stuck in Hell
I looked at God, he winked at me,
I made this mess myself
Don't be surprised and don't deny,
Hear every word I say
Close the door and don't look back,
Or you will fade away
It's funny how times can change, rearrange
And distance makes the pain fade away...
...[Chorus]  ...Full Circle ...Come full circle
...We have come full circle
