<song artist="Creed" title="Is_This_The_End?_(Acoustic_Version)">
The rage in my eyes
Could have compared to the eye of the sun
Then rage Took it's course through the hands of the son
Revenge for all time
The world is at war leaving all fault behind
And I ask so
Is this the end
For us my friend
So, is this the end
For us my friend
The stains on his side
Cover the sins of mankind and his pride
That night, he died
But rose once again to sit down by his side
He reigns for all time
Taking the keys back for your life
And mine
And I ask so
Is this the end for us my friend
So, is this the end for us my friend
So, is this the end for us my friend, oh yeah
But as the wind rides
As the day breaks the dawn
And as the moon hides the sun, oh the sun
No more sorrow, oh your crying days are gone
No more sorrow, now its gone, now its gone
They're gone
They're gone
They're gone
And I ask so
Is this the end for us my friend
So, is this the end for us my friend
So, is this the end for us my friend
So, is this the end for us my friend
