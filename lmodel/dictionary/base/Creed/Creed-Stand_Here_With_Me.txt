<song artist="Creed" title="Stand_Here_With_Me">
You always reached out to me
And helped me believe
All those memories we share
I will cherish every one of them
For the truth of it is
There's a right way to live, and you showed me
So now you live on in the words of a song
You're a melody
'Cause you stand here with me now, yeah
'Cause you stand here with me now, yeah
Just when fear blinded me
You taught me to dream
I'll give you everything I am
And still fall short of what you've done for me
In this life that I live
I hope I can give love unselfishly
I've learned the world is bigger than me
You're my daily dose of reality
'Cause you stand here with me now, yeah
'Cause you stand here with me now, yeah
On and on we sing, we sing this song
'Cause you stand here with me
On and on we'll sing
On and on we'll sing
On and on we'll sing
On and on we'll sing
On and on we'll sing
On and on we'll sing
On and on we'll sing
On and on we'll sing
On and on we'll sing
On and on we'll sing
On and on we'll sing
On and on we'll sing
On and on we'll sing
On and on we'll sing
On and on we'll sing
'Cause you stand here with me
