<song artist="Creed" title="Bullets">
Walking around I hear the sounds
Of the earth seeking relief
I'm trying to find a reason to live
But the mindless clutter my path
Oh these thorns in my side
Oh these thorns in my side
I know I have something free
I have something so alive
I think they shoot 'cause they want it
I think they shoot 'cause they want it
I think they shoot 'cause they want it!
I feel forces all around me
Come on raise your head
Those who hide behind the shadows
Live with all that's dead
Look at me!
Look at me!
Look at me!
At least look at me when you shoot a bullet through my head
Through my head
Through my head
In my lifetime when I'm disgraced
Jealousy and lies
I laugh aloud 'cause my life has gotten inside
Someone else's mind
Look at me!
Look at me!
Look at me!
At least look at me when you shoot a bullet through my head
Through my head
Through my head
Through my head
Hey all I want is what's real
Something I touch and can feel
I'll hold it close and never let it go
Said why
Why do we live this life
With all this hate inside
I'll give it away 'cause I don't want it no more
Please help me find a place 
Somewhere far away
Yes I'll go and you'll never see me again
Look at me!
look at me!
At least look at me when you shoot a bullet through my head
Through my head
Through my head
Look at me!
look at me!
At least look at me when you shoot a bullet through my head
Through my head
Through my head
Look at me!
Look at me!
