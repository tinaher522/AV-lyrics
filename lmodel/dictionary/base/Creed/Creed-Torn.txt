<song artist="Creed" title="Torn">
Peace is what they tell me
Love am I unholy?
Lies are what they tell me
Despise you that control me
The peace is dead in my soul
I have blamed reasons for my intention poor
Yes, I'm the one who, the only one who
Would carry on this far
Torn, I'm filthy
Born in my own misery
Stole all that you gave me
Control you claim you save me
The peace is dead in my soul
I have blamed reasons for my intention poor
Yes, I'm the one who, the only one who
Would carry on this far
Peace in my head
Love in my head
Lies, lies, lies, lies in my head
The peace is dead in my
Soul I have blamed reasons for my intentions poor
Yes, I'm the one who, the only one who
Would carry on this far
The peace is dead in my
Soul I have blamed reasons for my intentions poor
Yes, I'm the one who, the only one who
Would carry on this far
