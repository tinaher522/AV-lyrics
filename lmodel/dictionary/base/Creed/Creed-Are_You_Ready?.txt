<song artist="Creed" title="Are_You_Ready?">
Hey Mr. Seeker
Hold on to this advice
If you can seek then you will find
Don't want to follow
Down roads been walked before
So hard to find unopened doors
Are you ready?
Are you ready?
For what's to come
Oh, I said
"Are you ready?
Are you ready?
For what's to come"
Hey Mr. Hero
Walking a thin, fine line
Under the microscope of life
Remember your roots, my friend
They're right down below
'Cause heroes come and heroes go
Are you ready?
Are you ready?
For what's to come
Oh, I said
"Are you ready?
Are you ready?
For what's to come"
Ten, nine, eight, seven
Six, five, four, three, two, one
Countdown to the change in life
That's soon to come
Ten, nine, eight, seven
Six, five, four, three, two, one
Countdown to the change in life
That's soon to come
Your life has just begun
Life has just begun
Life has just begun
Life has just begun
Are you ready?
Are you ready?
For what's to come
Oh, I said
"Are you ready?
Are you ready?
For what's to come"
Oh, I said
"Are you ready?
Are you ready?
For what's to come"
Your life has just begun
Life has just begun
Life has just begun
Life has just begun
