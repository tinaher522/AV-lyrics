<song artist="Creed" title="Hide">
To what do I owe this gift, my friend?
My life? My love? My soul?
I've been dancing with the Devil way too long
And it's making me grow old
Making me grow old, yeah
Let's leave all this and get away
Get lost in time
Where there's no reason left to hide
Let's leave all this and get away
Run in fields of time
Where there's no reason left to hide
No reason to hide
What you going to do with your gift, dear child?
Give life? Give love? Give soul?
Divided is the one who dances
For the soul is so exposed
So exposed
Let's leave all this and get away
Get lost in time
Where there's no reason left to hide
Let's leave all this and get away
Run in fields of time
Where there's no reason left to hide
No reason to hide
There is no reason to hide
There is no reason to hide
There is no reason to hide
There is no reason to hide
Yeah
Let's leave all this and get away
Get lost in time
Where there's no reason left to hide
Let's leave all this and get away
Run in fields of time
Where there's no reason left to hide, yeah
Let's leave all this and get away
Get lost in time
Where there's no reason left to hide
No reason to hide
There is no reason to hide
No reason to hide
There is no reason to hide
No reason to hide
