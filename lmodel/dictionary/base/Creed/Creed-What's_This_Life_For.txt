<song artist="Creed" title="What's_This_Life_For">
Hurray for a child that makes it through
If there's any way because the answer lies in you
They're laid to rest before they've known just what to do
Their souls are lost because they could never find
What's this life for?
What's this life for?
What's this life for?
What's this life for?
I see your soul, it's kind of gray
You see my heart, you look away
You see my wrist, I know your pain
I know your purpose on your plane
Don't say a last prayer because you could never find
What's this life for?
What's this life for?
What's this life for?
What's this life for?
But they ain't here anymore
Don't have to settle the score
'Cause we all live under the reign
Of one king
But they ain't here anymore
Don't have to settle no goddamn score
'Cause we all live under the reign
I said, you know, of one king
One king
One king
But they ain't here anymore
Don't have to settle no goddamn score
'Cause we all live under the reign
I said, you know, of one king
One king
One king
But they ain't here anymore
Don't have to settle no goddamn score
'Cause we all live under the reign
Of one king
