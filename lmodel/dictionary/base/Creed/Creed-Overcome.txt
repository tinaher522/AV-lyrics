<song artist="Creed" title="Overcome">
Don't cry victim to me
Everything we are and used to be
Is buried and gone
Now it's my turn to speak
It's my turn to expose
And release what's been killin' me
I'll be damned fighting you
It's impossible, impossible
Say, "Goodbye"
With no sympathy
I'm entitled to overcome
Completely stunned and numb
Knock me down, throw me to the floor
There's no pain, I can't feel no more
I'm entitled to overcome
Overcome
Finally see what's beneath
Everything I am and hope to be
Cannot be lost
I'll be damned fighting you
You're impossible, impossible
Say, "Goodbye"
With no sympathy
I'm entitled to overcome
Completely stunned and numb
Knock me down, throw me to the floor
There's no pain, I can't feel no more
I'm entitled to overcome
Overcome
(Overcome)
You'll never know what I was thinkin'
Before you came 'round
Take a step, take a breath
Put your guard down (Overcome)
I cannot worry anymore of what you think of me
I may be crazy, but I'm buried in your memory
I'm entitled to overcome
Completely stunned and numb
Knock me down, throw me to the floor
There's no pain, I can't feel no more
(Look in my eyes)
I'm entitled to overcome
(I'll fight 'til I die)
Completely stunned and numb
(Look in my eyes)
I'm entitled to overcome
(I'll fight 'til I die)
Completely stunned and numb
I'm entitled to overcome
I may be crazy, but I'm buried in your memory
