<song artist="Creed" title="Faceless_Man">
I spent a day by the river
It was quiet and the wind stood still
I spent some time with nature
To remind me of all that's real
It's funny how silence speaks
Sometimes when you're alone
And remember that you feel
I said it's funny how silence speaks
Sometimes when you're alone
And remember that you feel
Again I stand, Lord I stand
Against the Faceless Man
Again I stand, Lord I stand
Against the Faceless Man
Now, I saw a face on the water
It looked humble but willing to fight
I saw the will of a warrior
His yoke is easy and His burden is light
He looked me right in the eyes
Direct and concise to remind me
To always do what's right
He looked me right in the eyes
Direct and concise to remind me
To always do what's right
Again I stand, Lord I stand
Against the Faceless Man
Again I stand, Lord, God I stand
Against the Faceless Man
'Cause if the face inside can't see the light
I know I'll have to walk alone
And if I walk alone to the other side
I know I might not make it home
Again I stand, Lord I stand
Against the Faceless Man
Again I stand, Lord I stand
Against the Faceless Man
Next time I see this face
I'll say I choose to live for always
So won't you come inside
And never go away?
Next time I see this face
I'll say I choose to live for always
So won't you come inside
And never go away?
Again I stand, Lord I stand
Against the Faceless Man
Again I stand, Lord I stand
Against the Faceless Man
Again I stand, Lord I stand
Against the Faceless Man
