<song artist="Creed" title="Away_In_Silence">
You walked away in silence
You walked away to breathe
Stopped and turned around,
To say goodbye to me
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm pleading as you're leaving,
I'm begging you stay
I'm not the man I used to be, I've changed  (x2)
[Chorus]
Don't give up on us - Don't give up on love  (x2)
If my life is the price - Then my life it will cost
Now that I'm picking up the pieces,
See the pain that I have caused - It's hard to,
Believe in someone you thought was lost
Don't give up on us - Don't give up on love
Don't you walk away in silence...
In tears, you counted reasons
Tears covered you, it seemed
Face down, screaming, "God help me please"
[Pre-Chorus]  /  [Chorus]...
...Please come back to me
...Don't you walk away in silence
...I'm not the man I used to be
Well, I pray that tomorrow you'll be home
-(We can rebuild &amp; forever we can go on)-
-(Go on, and go on)-  We can go on
-(Well, I pray that tomorrow you'll be home)-
Look at horizons &amp; let the light bring you home...
Home... Bring you home...
[Chorus]  ...Please don't walk away
...Don't you walk away in silence
...I'm not the man I used to be
