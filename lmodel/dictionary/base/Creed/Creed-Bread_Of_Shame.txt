<song artist="Creed" title="Bread_Of_Shame">
If you say I'm alive, I guess I'm living
Why should I exercise a choice I've been given?
Tell me everything's fine &amp; peace is coming
I won't listen to the heartache I'm numbing
[Chorus]
When the world,
Casts me down and says I've changed
I'll survive on all the promises you made to me
Guess there's no one to blame,
When all you're living on is bread of shame
[Pt.2]:  Bread of Shame
When the world says I've changed
Bread of shame - Just promise me fame
I'll survive on the bread of shame
As long as you say I'm free,
Then keep these chains on me
Tell me down is up,
I'll let you fill this broken cup
When the world falls down, let them fall on me
'Cause no one's around who believes me
[Chorus]
Tell me where I sign my name
Inside I find no peace of mind to hide behind
Only bread of shame
...(repeat, minus "to hide behind")
[Chorus Pt.2]
