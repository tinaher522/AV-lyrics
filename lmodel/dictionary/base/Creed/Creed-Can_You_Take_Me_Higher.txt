<song artist="Creed" title="Can_You_Take_Me_Higher">
When dreaming I'm guided to another world
Time and time again at sunrise I fight to stay asleep
'Cause I don't want to leave the comfort of this place
'Cause there's a hunger, a longing to escape
From the life I live when I'm awake
So let's go there
Let's make our escape
Come on, let's go there
Let's ask can we stay
Can you take me higher
To a place where blind men see?
Can you take me higher
To a place with golden streets?
Although I would like our world to change
It helps me to appreciate those nights and those dreams
But, my friend, I'd sacrifice all those nights
If I could make the earth and my dreams the same
The only difference is to let love replace all our hate
So let's go there
Let's make our escape
Come on, let's go there
Let's ask can we stay?
Can you take me higher
To a place where blind men see?
Can you take me higher
To a place with golden streets?
So let's go there, let's go there
Come on, let's go there
Let's ask can we stay?
Up high, I feel like I'm alive for the very first time
Set up high, I'm strong enough to take these dreams
And make them mine
Set up high, I'm strong enough to take these dreams
And make them mine
Can you take me higher
To a place where blind men see?
Can you take me higher
To a place with golden streets?
Can you take me higher
To a place where blind men see?
Can you take me higher
To a place with golden streets?
