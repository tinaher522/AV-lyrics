<song artist="Creed" title="Good_Fight">
I give my all, my everything
Anything you want, I've tried to be
I tried - God knows I tried
Or am I stuck somewhere between,
Who I am and who I hope to be?
Am I fighting the good fight?
[Chorus]
Keep pressing on - Fight the good fight
Fight what you know is wrong  (repeat)
I've come so far, to fall too fast
Eyes forward, I can't look back
I tried - God knows I tried
I shift my eyes to the sky,
In the distance, see the horizon line
She waits for me - Fighting the good fight
[Chorus (alt)]  (w/o 2nd "what you know...")
I give my all, my everything
Anything you want, I strive to be
Am I stuck somewhere between,
Who I am and who I hope to be?
Fighting, I'm fighting - Fighting the good fight
Am I stuck somewhere in between,
Who I am and who I hope to be?
[Chorus]
Remember that sometimes I fall in between,
The night's blue moon and the shadows it keeps
Fight on - Fight the good fight
-(What you know is wrong)-
And I'll keep fighting, (x2)
-Fight on - Keep fighting the good fight
-Fight on - Fight on  (- repeat)
