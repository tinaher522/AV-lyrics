<song artist="Creed" title="Time">
I can't explain - Can't quite put my finger on it
The difference that makes us so different
We've said everything...
Our words only betrayed us
Nothing is left - Northing was left unsaid
[Chorus]
This time I have nothing left to lose
I'm stuck - The second-hand won't move
Its about time I speak my mind
Its about time, about time I find...
Pieces of me I have lost
Without any choice I move on
Hey time, you're no friend of mine, (x2)
You cover yourself - You cover your skin
Your cover yourself like you cover your sin
Please untie my hands - I'm a sinner, I'm a man
I ask for one minute to make you understand
[Chorus]
Will you be there to catch me,
When I stumble, when I fal... when I fall?
Its so very clear - You left me,
When I had no one at all... No one at all...
Who will you be there to catch me,
To catch me when I stumble - when I fall, (x2)?
Its so very clear - You left me,
You left me with no one at all... No one at all...
[Chorus]  ...No friend of mine
TIme... -You're no friend of mine, (-x2)
Hey time, you're no friend of mine, (x2)
...The pieces of me I have lost
...Without any choice I move on
...Time ...Time, you're no friend of mine
