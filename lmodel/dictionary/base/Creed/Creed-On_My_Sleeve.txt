<song artist="Creed" title="On_My_Sleeve">
The eyes around me are so cold
With every chance they steal my soul
So walk with me - Talk with me - Hold my hand
I'm stumbling in consequence, it buries me alive
[Pre-Chorus]
Can you fix what's made to be broken?
I can't fix what's made to be...
[Chorus pt.1]
My Heart is tattooed on my sleeve
I'm not hiding, no, it only hurts to breathe
...(repeat)
Standing now, I'm alone
I need answers, tell me everything you know
So heavy is the night - Exhausted
Whispers tend to crucify my mind,
I'm fighting, but I'm blind
[Pre-Chorus]  /  [Chorus pt.1]...
[Chorus pt.2]:
My Heart is tattooed on my sleeve
I know it's blinding, oh, it only hurts,
It only hurts, (x2), to breathe
I shout out, "Can you hear me?"
Mistakes have cost me years
Do they cost you?
Are you like me?  Tell me please...
[Chorus (all)]
