<song artist="Creed" title="Silent_Teacher">
Silent Teacher, hold my hand,
And lead me to The Promised Land
Silent Teacher, please define,
This ordinary life won't bring - me to find it, (x2)
[Chorus]
I want to live with my head in the clouds
I want to stumble when I walk to find light
Can you tell me which way to go,
So I can bury Him in all of my mind?
Silent Teacher, promise me... (x2)
This ordinary life won't bring - me to find it, (x2)
[Chorus]...
[Bridge]:
Can we save everyone?
Or do we wait until the damage is done?  (repeat)
[Chorus x2]  /  [Bridge]
