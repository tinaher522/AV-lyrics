<song artist="Creed" title="Fear">
The cradle of civilization sparks my fascination
Truth ignites a generation to change,
What's been programmed inside my mind
[Pre-Chorus]
Don't you turn a blind eye
Change what's been programmed inside
Don't you turn a blind eye
[Chorus]
Listen to me when I tell you
Feel the passion in my breath
Stay on top if they let you
'Cause the - change is permanent, (x2)
Rudiments of interpersonal communication
Truth will uproot &amp; bring war's devastation to light
[Pre-Chorus (alt)]
-(line 3= Staying silent is a crime)-
[Chorus]
Change starts in your mind
Leave the past behind
Forget everything you know
Make a change - Let go  (repeat x3)
...Let go, (x4)
[Chorus]  ...Change is permanent
...Leave the past behind, (x2)
...Make a change - Let go... Let go, (x5)
