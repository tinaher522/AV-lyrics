<song artist="Pixies" title="Silver">
In this land of strangers, there are dangers
There are sorrows
I can't see this lady, it is shady
I am leaving tomorrow
Tomorrow
Tomorrow
Even there's a reason, it's silver
It's gone
In this land of strangers, there are dangers
There are sorrows
Sorrows
Sorrows
Sorrows
Sorrows
Sorrows
Sorrows
