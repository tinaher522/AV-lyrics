<song artist="Pixies" title="Dead">
I can't think of nothing
I'd like to do a nursery rhyme
You crazy babe Bathsheba, I want ya
You're suffocating, you need a good shed
I'm tired of living, Sheby, so give me dead
Dead
We're aping raping taping catharsis
You get torn down and I get erected
My blood is working but my, my heart is dead
Dead
Dead
Hey, what do you know?
Your lovely tan belly is starting to grow
Uriah hit the crapper, the crapper
Uriah hit the crapper, the crapper
Uriah hit the crapper, the crapper, dead
Dead
