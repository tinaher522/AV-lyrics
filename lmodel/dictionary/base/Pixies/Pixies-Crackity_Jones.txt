<song artist="Pixies" title="Crackity_Jones">
José Jones
Told me alone
His story
He got friends
Like Pacro Picopiedra
La Muneca
He receives on his set
Crack, crack, Crackity Jones
Crack, crack
Crack, crack, Crackity Jones
Crack, crack, Crackity Jones
(Wup, wup)
Crack, crack, Crackity Jones
Please forgive me
José Jones
You need these walls
For your own
I'm movin' out of this hospedaje
I'm afraid you'll cut me boy
Thirty miles by
Hundred miles by
Stinkin' island
Por goofiar
An' cruisin' automobile
Chasin' voices
He receives in his head
Crack, crack, Crackity Jones
(Wup, wup)
Crack, crack, Crackity Jones
Crack, crack, Crackity Jones
Crack, crack
Crack, crack, Crackity Jones
Crack, crack, Crackity Jones
(Wup, wup)
Crack, crack, Crackity Jones
