<song artist="Pixies" title="Winterlong">
I waited for you winterlong
You seemed to be where I belong
It's all illusion anyway
If things should ever turn out wrong
And all the love we have is gone
It won't be easy on that day
Waiting to follow 
Through the dream light of your way
Is not so easy for me now
After time has passed your way 
Things we thought of yesterday
Come back now
Come back now, woah
Waiting to follow 
Through the dream light of your way
Is not so easy for me now
After time has passed your way 
Things we thought of yesterday
Come back now
Come back now, woah
I waited for you winterlong
You seemed to be where I belong
I waited for you winterlong
You seemed to be where I belong
I waited for you winterlong
You seemed to be where I belong
I waited for you winterlong
You seemed to be where I belong
