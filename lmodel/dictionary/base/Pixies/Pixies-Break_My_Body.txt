<song artist="Pixies" title="Break_My_Body">
I'm the hard loser
You'll find me crashing through my mother's door
I am the ugly lover
You'll find us rolling on the dirty floor
Break my body, hold my bones, hold my bones
Break my body, hold my bones, hold my bones
Break my body, hold my bones, hold my bones
I'm a belly dancer
I'll shake forever and I never care
I'm a building-jumper
Roof to roof, you see me flying in the air
Break my body, hold my bones, hold my bones
Break my body, hold my bones, hold my bones
Break my body, hold my bones, hold my bones, bones
Somebody got hurt
Somebody get hurt
Somebody got hurt
