<song artist="Pixies" title="All_Over_The_World">
A pet at my side, God in the sky
Snow falling down, freeze my body to the ground
I can't ride, but one more time
I will ride all over the world
Washed over the side, top of the sky
Slow diver down, two feet land on a different ground
You can't live easily, you can't even speak
But all of them speak
All over the world, all over the world
All over the world, all over the world
All over the world, all over the world
All over the world
I will meet you over there
I am going to meet you over there
Washed over the side, top of the sky
Slow diver down, two feet land on a different ground
You can't live easily, you can't even speak
Fish, all of them speak all over the world
A plain with no herd, not even a bird
When one side is hot, the other side of the moon is not
It's just like a ride, maybe some time
They'll make it a ride
All over the world, all over the world
All over the world, all over the world
All over the world, all over the world
All over the world
I will meet you over there
I am going to meet you over there
Time is an arrangement
Time is an arranger
I am a derangement
All my thoughts
All I am are my thoughts
All my thoughts
I am all what I'm taught
Better call the ranger
Got a train derailment
Better call the ranger
What I'm taught
All I am are my thoughts 
All my thoughts
All I am are my thoughts
What I'm not
