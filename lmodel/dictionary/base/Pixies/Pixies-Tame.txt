<song artist="Pixies" title="Tame">
Got hips like Cinderella
Must be havin' a good shame
Talkin' sweet about nothin'
Cookie, I think you're tame
Tame, tame
Tame, tame
I'm making good friends with you
When you're shakin' your good frame
Fall on your face in those bad shoes
Lying there like you're tame
Tame, tame
Tame, tame
Tame, tame
Tame
Tame
Tame, tame
Tame, tame
Tame, tame
