<song artist="Pixies" title="Santo">
By the old seaside
Ain't no place far to go, I don't know
I don't know, ain't no place far to go
It's a dollar, she say
Te amo le mas
Te amo le mas
Santo, Santo, Santo, Santo
Hey ya' boy, how ya' doin'?
Come here, boy
Here she come a slitherin'
Duh, duh, grunt, duh
Here she come a slitherin'
Che cha chu bah che cha
Te amo le mas
Te amo le mas
Santo, Santo, Santo, Santo
Buzzard eels, buzzer bikinis
Eat your rouge, a chini weinies
A warm gardeda, da' mamacita
Duh, a poutin' grandma
In a corner, a passin' time
Hey, hey, praying to far to
Santo, Santo, Santo, Santo
