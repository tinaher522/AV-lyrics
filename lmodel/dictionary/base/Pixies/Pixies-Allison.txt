<song artist="Pixies" title="Allison">
From distant star to this here bar
The me, the you, where are we now?
Hooray, the blues of everyone
Allison
Keeps a smile around a while
He took no fright and jettisoned
We'll go tonight to hear him tell
Oh well
Allison
Allison
And when the planets hit the sun
I saw the face of Allison
Allison
Allison
Allison
Allison
