<song artist="Pixies" title="Monkey_Gone_To_Heaven">
There was a guy
An underwater guy who controlled the sea
Got killed by ten million pounds of sludge from New York and New Jersey
This monkey's gone to heaven
This monkey's gone to heaven
This monkey's gone to heaven
This monkey's gone to heaven
The creature in the sky
Got sucked in a hole, now there's a hole in the sky
And the ground's not cold
And if the ground's not cold, everything is gonna burn
We'll all take turns, I'll get mine, too
This monkey's gone to heaven
This monkey's gone to heaven
This monkey's gone to heaven
This monkey's gone to heaven
Rock me, Joe
If man is five, if man is five, if man is five
Then the devil is six, then the devil is six
Then the devil is six, then the devil is six
And if the devil is six, then God is seven
Then God is seven, then God is seven
This monkey's gone to heaven
This monkey's gone to heaven
This monkey's gone to heaven
This monkey's gone to heaven
This monkey's gone to heaven
This monkey's gone to heaven
This monkey's gone to heaven
This monkey's gone to heaven
This monkey's gone to heaven
