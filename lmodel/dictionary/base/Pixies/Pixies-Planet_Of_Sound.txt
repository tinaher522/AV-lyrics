<song artist="Pixies" title="Planet_Of_Sound">
One fine day in my odd past
I picked me up a transmission
I turned the fission ignition
Went looking for the broadcaster
And when I first touched some ground
They simply told me to leave
Was kind of hard to believe
'Cause there was no one around
This ain't the planet of sound
This ain't the planet of sound
This ain't the planet of sound
This ain't the planet of sound
I had a talented wine
That land of classical gas
And on the planet of glass
They sent me skipping through time
I got to somewhere renowned
For its canals and color of red
And lots of guys who shook their heads
Rhythmically to resound
This ain't the planet of sound
This ain't the planet of sound
This ain't the planet of sound
This ain't the planet of sound
This ain't the planet of sound (This ain't the planet)
This ain't no rock and roll town (This ain't the planet)
This ain't no fuckin' around (This ain't the planet)
This ain't the planet of sound (This ain't the planet)
I met a guy in a Rover
He said, "It's one more over
It's just there where you're bound"
This ain't the planet of sound
This ain't the planet of sound (This ain't the planet)
This ain't the planet of sound (This ain't the planet)
This ain't the planet of sound (This ain't the planet)
This ain't the planet of sound (This ain't the planet)
