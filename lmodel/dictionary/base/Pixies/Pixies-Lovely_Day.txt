<song artist="Pixies" title="Lovely_Day">
At the station, at the border
An egression to the exterior law and order
Upward plantation
I remember your red dress like a field full o' poppies
It was making me dreamy
Stunned by a love, got to do what your head says
Could not let it stop me
They got one leaving today
They got one leaving today
They got one leaving today
And it's going away
They got one leaving today
They got one leaving today
They got one leaving today
And it's going away
Got my feet in the stirrup, it can be kind of banal
But I dream of your red dress riding down these dry canals
Oh baby, it's not Europe
But I send you money
I'm send you lots of money so you can buy a ticket
You will be my Martian honey all the day
They got one leaving today
They got one leaving today
They got one leaving today
And it's going away
They got one leaving today
They got one leaving today
They got one leaving today
And it's going away
