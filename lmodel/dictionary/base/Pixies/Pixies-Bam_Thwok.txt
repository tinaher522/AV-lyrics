<song artist="Pixies" title="Bam_Thwok">
I can hear the buzz of modulations of the universe
But you're the first to make me feel it
It's only joy I ache
Love, bang, crash
Wakka, wakka
Bam thwok
Love, bang, crash
Wakka, wakka
Bosses and offices on automatic drip
They got the keys to the city, but we got a lot of shakin' in our hips0
Oh, you know me
I love the universe, I love all the listeners
Watch it, here's 50,000 watts of goodwill
Oh, it's only joy I ache
Love, bang, crash
Wakka, wakka
Bam thwok
Love, bang, crash
Wakka, wakka
Bam thwok
Love, bang, crash
Wakka, wakka
Bam thwok
Love, bang, crash
Wakka, wakka
I can hear the buzzing modulations of the universe
But you're the first to make me feel it
I love the universe, I love all the listeners
Watch it, here's 50,000 watts of goodwill
Love, bang, crash
Wakka, wakka
Bam thwok
Love, bang, crash
Wakka, wakka
Bam thwok
Love, bang, crash
Wakka, wakka
Bam thwok
Love, bang, crash
Wakka, wakka
Bam thwok
Love, bang, crash
Wakka, wakka
Bam thwok
Love, bang, crash
Wakka, wakka
