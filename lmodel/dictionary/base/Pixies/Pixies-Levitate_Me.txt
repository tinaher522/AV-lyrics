<song artist="Pixies" title="Levitate_Me">
Give me help, give me hell
You can levitate me
Then take off them rings
Off them hose, levitate me
Higher place, levitate me
Elevator lady, elevator lady
Elevator lady, elevator lady
Lady levitate me
If all in all is true, if all in all is true
If all in all is true, if all is true
Won't you please fawn over me?
Won't you please fawn over me?
Won't you please fawn over me?
Won't you please fawn over me?
Shaky shake, hey shaky
Levitate me
Come on pilgrim you know he loves you
Levitate me
Higher place
He kicked a baby
Elevator lady, elevator lady
Elevator lady, lady elevator lady
Lady, lady levitate me
If all in all is true, if all in all is true
If all in all is true, if all is true
Won't you please run over me?
Won't you please run over me?
Won't you please run over me?
Won't you please run over me?
Won't you please run over me?
Won't you please run over me?
Me, me, me, me
