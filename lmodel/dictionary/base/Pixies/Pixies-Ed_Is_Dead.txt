<song artist="Pixies" title="Ed_Is_Dead">
Her head is in a bitter way
Her brain's on fire
She's just looking for the perfect wave
It's her brain's desire
I'll think of her when I walk the strand
On this true hormosa night
Ed is dead (Ed is dead)
Ed is dead (Ed is dead)
She's just rotting in stupid bliss
With music on her bars
Her face burning in the L.A. sun
She got no, got no fears of cars
I'll dedicate my strand cruiser
To the memory of her, ohh, oh oh oh oh oh
Ed is dead, Ed is dead
Ed is dead, Ed is dead, Ed is
Ed is dead, Ed is, yeah, Ed is
Ed is dead, uh-huh, uh-huh, Ed is, Ed is
Ed is dead, Ed is, yi yi yi yi yi yi!
Ed is dead
E.I.D., E.I.D., E.I.D.
No no no no no
