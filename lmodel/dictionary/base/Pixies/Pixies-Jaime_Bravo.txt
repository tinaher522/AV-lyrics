<song artist="Pixies" title="Jaime_Bravo">
Oh my, look at you go by
It's so nice just to see you
Oh ooh ooh
It feels right here in the sunlight  
And this ride is almost through 
Oh ooh ooh
Oh ooh ooh
So goodbye and goodnight 
I can't hide holding a bull's eye 
A bullfighter and his crew
Oh ooh ooh
It's so nice here in the sunlight 
And this ride is almost through 
Oh ooh ooh
Oh ooh ooh 
So goodbye and goodnight 
Goodbye and goodnight
Goodbye and goodnight
Goodbye
La trapezista camina por la cuerda floja 
Desde el D. F. y todo el mundo 
Y ultimo a Zacatecas 
So nice here in the sunlight 
A bullfighter and his crew 
Oh ooh ooh
Oh ooh ooh 
So goodbye and goodnight 
Goodbye and goodnight 
Goodbye and goodnight 
Goodbye and goodnight
