In heaven, everything is fine
In heaven, everything is fine
In heaven, everything is fine
You've got your good thing
And I've got mine
In heaven, everything is fine
In heaven, everything is fine
In heaven, everything is fine
You got your good thing
And you've got mine
In heaven! Everything is fine
In heaven
In heaven! Everything is fine
In heaven
You've got your good thing
and you've got mine!
In heaven, everything... is... fine
