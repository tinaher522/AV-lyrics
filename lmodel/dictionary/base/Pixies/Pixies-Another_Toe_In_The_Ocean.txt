<song artist="Pixies" title="Another_Toe_In_The_Ocean">
I have a drink, I start to sink
I put my toe in the ocean
I have a drink, I start to sink
Another toe in the ocean
Down on the shelf an elf I saw
I took his picture he was waving
I passed again and now they're gone
I think my picture is worth saving
No more waiting for a new day
You gotta swim sometimes
I'll be here for the rest of my life
Up in the land of green
Making love in the cool black sand
Thinking where I've been
Ooh
I put my toe in the ocean
Another toe in the ocean
Merry making with the fairies
Going down to the onion patch
To you and me to shining seas
I see the lights of Edward Thatch
No more waiting for a new day
You gotta swim sometimes
I'll be here for the rest of my life
Up in the land of green
Making love in the cool black sand
Thinking where I've been
Ooh
I put my toe in the ocean
I have a drink, I start to sink
Another toe in the ocean
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
I have a drink, I start to sink
I put my toe in the ocean
I have a drink, I start to sink
Another toe in the ocean
I have a drink, I start to sink
Another toe in the ocean
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah
