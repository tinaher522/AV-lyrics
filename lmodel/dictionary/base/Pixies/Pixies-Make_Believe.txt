<song artist="Pixies" title="Make_Believe">
I've been lost
Since she's gone
The piano
She's really on
I don't want you to
Marry me
Make believe
You're Debbie G
Come look down on
Who you are
She is love with a voice
And a shape that's my guitar
I don't want you
You want me
Make believe
You're Debbie G
Make believe
You're Debbie G
Make believe
You're Debbie G
