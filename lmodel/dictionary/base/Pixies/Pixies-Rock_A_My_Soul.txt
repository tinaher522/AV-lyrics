<song artist="Pixies" title="Rock_A_My_Soul">
I turned you on the roof to shine your face at me.
Drink wine from your tears, rollin'.
Holy moly, rock a my soul
Hey, rock a my soul
Mmm, rock a my soul
Ahh, rock a my soul
Hey, rock a my soul
Hard.
I'm waiting
We're waiting
For electric
In a manor, manor
I'm waiting.
We're waiting, sister shaking.
Harder I try,
All the odder I feel,
like a 
Coltrane
No brain.
Rock a my soul
Hey, rock a my soul
Hey, rock a my soul
Oh, rock a my soul
Hey, rock a my soul
Hard
I'm waiting
We're waiting
For electric-
In a manor, manor
I'm waiting
We're waiting
