<song artist="Pixies" title="Gigantic">
And this I know, his teeth as white as snow
What a gas it was to see him
Walk her every day into a shady place
With her lips, she said, she said
Hey Paul, hey Paul, hey Paul, let's have a ball
Hey Paul, hey Paul, hey Paul, let's have a ball
Hey Paul, hey Paul, hey Paul, let's have a ball
Gigantic, gigantic, gigantic
A big, big love
Gigantic, gigantic, gigantic
A big, big love
Lovely legs there are
What a big black mass, what a hunk of love
He'll walk her every day into a shady place
He's like the dark, but I'd want him
Hey Paul, hey Paul, hey Paul, let's have a ball
Hey Paul, hey Paul, hey Paul, let's have a ball
Hey Paul, hey Paul, hey Paul, let's have a ball
Gigantic, gigantic, gigantic
A big, big love
Gigantic, gigantic, gigantic
A big, big love
Gigantic, gigantic, gigantic
A big, big love
Gigantic, gigantic, gigantic
A big, big love
A big, big love
A big, big love
A big, big love
A big, big love
A big, big love
A big, big love
A big, big love
A big, big love
