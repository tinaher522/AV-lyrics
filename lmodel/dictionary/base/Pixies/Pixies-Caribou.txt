<song artist="Pixies" title="Caribou">
I live cement
I hate this street
Give dirt to me
I got lament
This human form
Where I was born
I now repent
Caribou
Caribou
Caribou
Ooh
Repent
Repent
Give me white
Ground to run
Air for gun
Let me knife
Knife me let
I will get
What I like
Caribou
Caribou
Caribou
Ooh
Repent
Repent
