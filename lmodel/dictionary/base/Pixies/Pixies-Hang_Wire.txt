<song artist="Pixies" title="Hang_Wire">
They're going higher
Wind is whistling on the barbs
Your head's a hammer
Hang wire
Hang wire
Hang wire
Meet you at the hang wire
That man is a liar
The day is like a warm night
Salt rusts the cold line
Hang wire
Hang wire
Hang wire
Meet you at the hang wire
Every morning and every day
I'll bossanova with you
If there were a fire
Can we scratch beneath this?
Hang wire
Hang wire
Hang wire
Meet you at the hang wire
Hang wire, they're going higher
Hang wire
Hang wire, they're going higher
Hang wire
Hang wire, they're going higher
Hang wire
Hang wire
Hang wire
Hang wire
Hang wire
Hang wire
Hang wire
