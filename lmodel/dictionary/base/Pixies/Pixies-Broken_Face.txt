I got a broken face, I got a...
I got a broken face, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, ooh
I got a broken face
I got a broken face
I got a broken face
There was this boy who had two children
With his sisters
Who were his daughters
Who were his favorite lovers
I got no lips, I got no tongue
Where there were eyes, there's only space
I got no lips, I got no tongue
I got a broken face, uh-huh, uh-huh
I got a broken face
There was this man who snapped his brain
In little pieces
And then they drilled holes
And then they put 'em back in there
I got no lips, I got no tongue
Where there were eyes, there's only space
I got no lips, I got no tongue
I got a broken face, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, ooh
I got a broken face
The little thing who does my laundry
Speaks no English
But if you saw her
You'd say, "Isn't she lovely?"
I got no lips, I got no tongue
Where there were eyes, there's only space
I got no lips, I got no tongue
