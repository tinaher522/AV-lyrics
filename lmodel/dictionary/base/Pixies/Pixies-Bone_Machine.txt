<song artist="Pixies" title="Bone_Machine">
(This is a song for Carol!)
You're into Japanese fast food, and I dropped you off with your Japanese lover
And you're going to the beach all day
You're so pretty when you're unfaithful to me
You're so pretty when you're unfaithful to me
Oh, you're looking like you got some sun
Your blistered lips have got a kiss
That taste a bit like everyone
Your bone's got a little machine
You're the bone machine
I was talking to preachy-preach about kissy-kiss
He bought me a soda
He bought me a soda
He bought me a soda and he tried to molest me in the parking lot
Yep, yep, yep, yep!
I'll make you pray, you make me hard
Your island skin looks Mexican
Our love is rice and beans and horse's lard
Your bone's got a little machine
You're the bone machine
Your bone's got a little machine
