<song artist="Pixies" title="Brick_Is_Red">
A fish is fast and Jimmy's cast
Hang me
A white moon's hot, the other side's not
Hang me
It's not time for me to go
It's not time for me to go
My eyes have turned just the color of diamonds
Just the color, the frayed color of ice
My eyes have turned just the color of diamonds
Just the color, the frayed color of ice
