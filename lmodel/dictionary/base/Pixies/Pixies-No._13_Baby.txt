<song artist="Pixies" title="No._13_Baby">
Got hair in a girl that flows to her bones
And a comb in her pocket if the wind get blown
Stripes on her eyes when she walks slow
But her face falls down when she go, go, go
Black tear falling on my lazy queen
Got a tattooed tit, say number thirteen
Viva, don't want no blue eyes
La loma, I want brown eyes
Rica, I'm in a state
I'm in a state
I'm in a state, I'm in a state
I'm in a state, oh
Choir in the yard in the house next door
Where her grandma brought some songs from the shore
Six-foot girl gonna sweat when she digs
Stand close to the fire when they light the pig
Standing in her chinos, shirt pulled off clean
Got a tattooed tit, say number thirteen
Viva, don't want no blue eyes
La loma, I want brown eyes
Rica, I'm in a state
I'm in a state
I'm in a state, I'm in a state
I'm in a state, oh
Viva, don't want no blue eyes
La loma, I want brown eyes
Rica, I'm in a state
