<song artist="Pixies" title="I've_Been_Tired">
One, two, three...
She's a real left-winger 'cause she been down south,
And held peasants in her arms, she said,
"I could tell you stories that could make you cry. What about you?"
I said, "Me too. I could tell you a story that would make you cry."
And she sighed, "Ahh..."
I said, "I want to be a singer like Lou Reed."
"I like Lou Reed," she said, sticking her tongue in my ear.
"Let's go, let's sit, let's talk, politics goes so good with beer,
"And while we're at it, baby, why don't you tell me one of your biggest fears?"
I said, "Losing my penis to a whore with disease."
"Just kidding," I said. "Losing my life to a whore with disease."
She said, "Excuse me, please?"
I said, "Losing my life to a whore with disease."
I said, "Please."
Well, I'm a humble guy with healthy desire.
Don't give me no shit because:
I've been tired, I've been tired, I've been tired,
I've been tired, I've been tired, I've been tired...
I tell the tale of a girl but I call her a woman, 
She's a little bit older than me,
Strong legs, strong face, voice like milk, breasts like a cluster of grapes.
I can't escape her ways -- she raise me...
She make me feel like Solomon, be one of your babies even if you have no one.
"And while we're at it, baby, why don't you tell me one of your biggest fears?"
You don't want to sleep after setting my loins on fire...
Well, that's okay because:
I've been tired, I've been tired, I've been tired,
I've been tired, I've been tired, I've been tired,
I've been tired, I've been tired, I've been tired,
I've been tired, I've been tired, I've been tired,
I've been tired, I've been tired, I've been tired...
T-I-R-E-D spells it, spells it, spells it, spells it.
