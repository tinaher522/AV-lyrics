<song artist="Pixies" title="Untitled">
"You fuckin' die," I said to her
I said, "You fuckin' die," to her
Huh? What?
No, no, I was talking to Kim
I said, "You fuckin' die"
No, I was, we were just goofing around
No, no, it didn't have anything to do with anything
She said, "Don't anybody touches my stuff," and I said, "'You fuckin' die," like that
I was finishing her part for her
You know what I mean?
