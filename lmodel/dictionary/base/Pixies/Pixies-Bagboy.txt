<song artist="Pixies" title="Bagboy">
I had a bad reaction to your â€“ to your public hobby writings
(Cover your breath, cover your teeth)
I get no satisfaction from your very recent sightings
(Cover your breath, polish your speech)
(Cover your breath, cover your teeth)
(Cover your breath, polish your speech)
Like when I hear the sound of feet slapping on the runway
(Cover your breath, polish your speech)
Like a small bird pretty while it's crapping on the new day
(Cover your breath, polish your teeth)
(Cover your breath, polish your speech)
So disappointed I was that I had made small talk with you
(Polish your teeth, alter your breath)
I'm not feeling your buzz, I only smell your crock of stew
(Alter your teeth, cover your breath)

Bagboy
Bagboy
Bagboy (bagboy)
Bagboy (bagboy)
Bagboy (bagboy)
Bagboy (bagboy)
She had some beauty and manners, but you look like a bug
(Cover your breath, alter your speech)
Migrations of their type are such good planners and not smug
(Cover your breath, alter your speech)
Bagboy (bagboy)
Bagboy (bagboy)
Bagboy (bagboy, hey)
Bagboy (bagboy)
Bagboy (bagboy)
Bagboy (bagboy)
Bagboy (bagboy, bagboy)
Bagboy (bagboy)
You are proselytizing alone, listening to the voice with your ears
(Cover your breath, cover your teeth)
You have regurgitated the tone, now sat in your tract for many years
(Cover your breath, polish your speech)
Picked up from dead things that you licked
It's a feedback loop you can't evict
(Cover your breath, polish your teeth)
(Polish your teeth, cover your breath)
(Alter your teeth, cover your breath)
(Cover your breath, alter your speech)
Bagboy
