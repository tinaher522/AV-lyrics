<song artist="Pixies" title="Down_To_The_Well">
Betty always knows, Betty always tells
She's laughing desperately
Said it felt like a river inside her bones
When she went down to the well
I'm gonna be with her, she's gonna take me there
Lead me by my hand
Her body a rocking chair for my soul
When we go down to the well
I can hardly wait, baby
I can hardly wait
'Til we go down to the well
Been thinking to myself, and if a love's not long
What matter does it make?
If there'll be favorite songs playing in my head
When we go down to the well
I can hardly wait, Betty
I can hardly wait
'Til we go down to the well
Down to the well, down to the well
