<song artist="Pixies" title="I've_Been_Waiting_For_You">
I've been looking for a woman
To save my life
Not to beg, or to borrow
A woman with the feeling
Of losing once or twice
Who knows how it could be tomorrow?
I've been waiting for you
And you've been coming for me
For such a long time now
Such a long time now
A woman with the feeling
Of losing once or twice
Who knows how it could be tomorrow? 
I've been waiting for you
And you've been coming for me
For such a long time now
Such a long time now
For such a long time now
Such a long time now
For such a long time now
Such a long time now
For such a long time now
Such a long time now
For such a long time now
Such a long time now
For such a long time now
Such a long time now
For such a long time now
