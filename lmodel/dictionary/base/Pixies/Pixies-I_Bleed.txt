<song artist="Pixies" title="I_Bleed">
As loud as hell, a ringing bell
Behind my smile, it shakes my teeth
And all the while, as vampires feed
I bleed, I bleed
I bleed
Prithee, my dear, why are we here?
Nobody knows, we go to sleep
As breathing flows, my mind secedes
I bleed, I bleed
I bleed, I bleed
I bleed, I bleed
There's a place in the buried west in a cave
With a house in it in the clay
The holes of hands, you can place a hand in hand
I bleed, I bleed
I bleed
