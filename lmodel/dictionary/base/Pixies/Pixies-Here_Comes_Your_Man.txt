<song artist="Pixies" title="Here_Comes_Your_Man">
Outside there's a boxcar waitin'
Outside the family stew
Out by the fire breathin'
Outside we wait 'til face turns blue
I know the nervous walkin'
I know the dirty beard hangs
Out by the boxcar waitin'
Take me away to nowhere plains
There is a wait so long (so long, so long)
You'll never wait so long
Here comes your man
Here comes your man
Here comes your man
Big shake on the boxcar movin'
Big shake to the land that's falling down
Is a wind makes a palm stop blowin'
A big, big stone fall and break my crown
There is a wait so long (so long, so long)
You'll never wait so long
Here comes your man
Here comes your man
Here comes your man
Here comes your man
There is a wait so long (so long, so long)
You'll never wait so long
Here comes your man
Here comes your man
Here comes your man
Here comes your man
Here comes your man
Here comes your man
Here comes your man
Here comes your man
Here comes your man
Here comes your man
Here comes your man
Here comes your man
Here comes your man
