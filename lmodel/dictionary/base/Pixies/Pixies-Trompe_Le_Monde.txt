<song artist="Pixies" title="Trompe_Le_Monde">
Why do cupids and
Angels continually haunt her dreams like memories
Of another life?
Is painted on her shirt with capitals
Out on the free freeway
There's only she and they
Represented by the lights
We went to the store
And bought something great
Which samples this song
From Washington State
Go little record, go
It is named by some guy named Joe
And the words are the letters of the word
Said electrically played for outer space and those of they who paid
This song is twice occurred
And now it's time to go away on holiday
