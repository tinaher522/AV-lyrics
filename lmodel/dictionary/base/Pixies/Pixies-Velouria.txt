<song artist="Pixies" title="Velouria">
Hold my head, we'll trampoline
Finally through the roof
On to somewhere near
And far in time
Velouria, her covering
Traveling career
She can really move
Oh velveteen
My Velouria
My Velouria
Even I'll adore you, my Velouria
Even I'll adore you, my Velouria
Say to me, where have you been?
Finally through the roof
And how does lemur skin
Reflect the sea?
We will wade in the shine of the ever
We will wade in the shine of the ever
We will wade in the tides of the summer
Every summer, every summer, every
My Velouria, my Velouria
Forever green, I know she's here
In California
I can see the tears
Of shastasheen
My Velouria
My Velouria
Even I'll adore you, my Velouria
Even I'll adore you, my Velouria
