<song artist="Pixies" title="Into_The_White">
And there ain't no night
And there ain't no night
Did you hear what I said?
The big white
The big white
The big white
The big white
And there ain't no day
And there ain't no day
And there ain't no night
And there ain't no night
And there ain't no day
And there ain't no night
Into the white
Into the white
Into the white
Did you hear what I said?
Did you hear what I said?
Deeper than your sleepy head
Deeper than your sleepy head
Ain't nothing to see
Ain't nothing in sight
Into the white
Into the white
Into the white
Go and you go real far
Go and you go real far
Just past the big Quasar
Just past the big Quasar
Can't hitch a meteorite
Can't hitch a meteorite
Into the white
Into the white
Into the white
Into the white
Into the white
Into the white
Into the white
Into the white
Into the white
Into the white
Into the white
Into the white
Into the white
