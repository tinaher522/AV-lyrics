<song artist="Pixies" title="Palace_Of_The_Brine">
In a place they say is dead
In the lake that's like an ocean
I count about a billion head
All the time, there's a motion
Palace of the brine
Palace of the brine
I saw the cloning
Of the famous family
I hear the droning
In the shrine of the sea monkey
Palace of the brine
Palace of the brine
Beneath reflections in the fountain
The starry sky in Utah mountains
They are swimming happily
Can't you see?
A life that's so sublime
Palace of the brine
