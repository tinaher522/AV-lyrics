<song artist="Pixies" title="Manta_Ray">
All in a day
All for me
Trek across the space
It'll be just like they say
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah
Since I am told
Month number three
He has no memory
Of fliers in the night
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah
They went away
They went away
My manta ray is all right
My manta ray is all right
My manta ray is all right
My manta ray is all right
Police they say
My mother too
A fish from ocean blue
Above my head tonight
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah
There is a way
There is a way
My manta ray is all right
My manta ray is all right
My manta ray is all right
My manta ray is all right
My manta ray is all right
My manta ray is all right
My manta ray is all right
My manta ray is all right
My manta ray is all right
My manta ray is all right
My manta ray is all right
My manta ray is all right
All right
