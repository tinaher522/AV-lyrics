<song artist="Pixies" title="Bailey's_Walk">
Bailey
He takes some steps
And bopped his head
He spins
(Turns around)
Takes some steps
Yeah
The method
Of stop, tap, spin
No talkin'
Bailey's walk
The method
Of stop, tap, spin
Of no talkin'
Bailey's walk
Bailey!
Bailey!
On parking lots
And big highways
Daily
It's crazy
Yeah
The method
Of stop, tap, spin
Of no talkin'
Bailey's walk
The method
Of stop, tap, spin
