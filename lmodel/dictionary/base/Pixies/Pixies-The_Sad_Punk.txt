<song artist="Pixies" title="The_Sad_Punk">
I smell smoke that comes from a gun
Named extinction, named extinction
Named extinction, named ext
It was so long ago, could have happened to anyone
He was struck by a bullet and he melted into fluid
Named extinction, named extinction
Named extinction, named extinction
Named extinction
One thousand miles an hour, I'm just like anyone
I want to feel the road of tar beneath the wheel
Named extinction, named extinction
Named extinction, named ex
And evolving from the sea
Would not be too much time for me
To walk beside you in the sun
I read something about a son of a gun
Named extinction, extinction
Extinction
