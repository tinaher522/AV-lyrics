<song artist="Pixies" title="What_Goes_Boom">
Fatty had it made like a blade in the sun
Like a push in the bush when you got none
Ping pong bingo, fills a la Ringo
Analog bong but it ring wrong
Make some room
What goes boom
I'm a fatty in my caddy with my ponic blunt
Not a stunted runt looking natty
Cozy as a manger, Chet Baker in the changer
Subs for my dub, really got you
Make some room
What goes boom
Grace
In her lace and her stocking
Carrying her bass
She really likes to get rocking
Oh, darling Grace (oh, darling Grace)
Are we gonna get rocking?
I like that slinky little punky, little bit funky
Itty bitty chunky right there
Little bit lippy, a whipped cream hippie
Zip and unzippy and I want her
Make some room
What goes boom (what goes boom)
Make some room (make some room)
What goes boom
Grace
In her lace and her stocking
Carrying her bass
She really likes to get rocking
Oh darling Grace (oh, darling Grace)
Are we gonna get rocking? (rocking)
Grace
Are we gonna get rocking? (rocking)
(Make some room)
(What goes boom)
