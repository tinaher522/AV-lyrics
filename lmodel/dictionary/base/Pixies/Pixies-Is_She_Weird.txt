<song artist="Pixies" title="Is_She_Weird">
I know you're rich in
Good clothes and little things
Your mind is fancy
And your car is bitchin'
Is she weird?
Is she weird, is she white, is she promised to the night?
And her head has no room
Is she weird, is she white, is she promised to the night?
And her head has no room
Is she weird, is she white, is she promised to the night?
And her head has no room
And her head has no room
Your heart is rip-shit
Your mouth is everywhere
I'm lyin' in it
Is she weird?
Is she over me?
Like the stars and the sun
Like the stars and the sun
Is she weird, is she white, is she promised to the night?
And her head has no room
Is she weird, is she white, is she promised to the night?
And her head has no room
Is she weird, is she white, is she promised to the night?
And her head has no room
And her head has no room
No more of this girl cryin'
I'm here, your big man
You're mine
Is she weird, is she white, is she promised to the night?
And her head has no room
Is she weird, is she white, is she promised to the night?
And her head has no room
Is she weird, is she white, is she promised to the night?
And her head has no room
Is she weird, is she white, is she promised to the night?
And her head has no room
Is she weird, is she white, is she promised to the night?
And her head has no room
Her head has no room
