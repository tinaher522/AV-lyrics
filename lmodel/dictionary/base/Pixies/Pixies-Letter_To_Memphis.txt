<song artist="Pixies" title="Letter_To_Memphis">
The day since I met her
I can't believe it's true
She came here from Memphis
Across the ocean sailing and I saw her
And I pleaded, "Why do you come so far?"
And she said, "Trying to get to you
How I tried to get to you
Trying to get to you"
I'm sending a letter
I'll send it right to you
I'll send it to Memphis
I know that someday everything I needed and I wanted
Used to be that my head was haunted
And all these sirens
They make me mad
And all this violence
It brings me down
I feel strong, I feel lucky
"Trying to get to you"
Said, "I'm going to get to you
Trying to get to you"
