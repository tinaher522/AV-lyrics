<song artist="Pixies" title="Indie_Cindy">
Put this down for the record
It's more or less uncheckered
Wasted days and wasted nights
Made me a fucking beggar
No soul, my milk is curdled
I'm the Bürgermeister of purgatory
Look out for that hot plate
Guess that's all you got, great
You put the cock in cocktail, man
Well, I put the tail in – wait
Watch me walk
Blowtorch a hole in that armor
And I don't need the tip
I'm in love with your daughter
And though she has no need
I'm the one who's got some trotters
You've many mouths to feed
Indie Cindy
Be in love with me
I beg for you to carry me
Mixed messages from Sir Naff
Please authenticate
Just to be sure that you're a sap
Set for stun automatica
Crap is the operative
Locomotive of the longest death
There goes Indie Cindy
Whose sails were black when it was windy
We offed ourselves in a lover's pact
We threw ourselves into the sea
Well look-see what the wind washed back
As we follow the bouncing ball
They call this dance the washed-up crawl
I'm in love with your daughter
And though she has no need
I'm the one who's got some trotters
You've many mouths to feed
I'm in love with your daughter
And though she has no need
I'm the one who's got some trotters
You've many mouths to feed
Indie Cindy
Be in love with me
I beg you for you to carry me
Indie Cindy
Be in love with me
I beg you for you to carry me
Indie (Indie) Cindy (Cindy)
Be in love with me
I beg you for you to carry me
I beg you for you to carry me
I beg you for you to carry me
