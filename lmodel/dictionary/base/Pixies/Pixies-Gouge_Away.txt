<song artist="Pixies" title="Gouge_Away">
Gouge away, you can gouge away
Stay all day if you want to
Missy aggravation
Some sacred questions, you stroke my locks
Some marijuana if you got some
Gouge away, you can gouge away
Stay all day if you want to
Sleeping on your belly
You break my arms, you spoon my eyes
Been rubbing a bad charm with holy fingers
Gouge away, you can gouge away
Stay all day if you want to
Chained to the pillars
A 3 day party, I break the walls
And kill us all with holy fingers
Gouge away, you can gouge away
Stay all day if you want to
