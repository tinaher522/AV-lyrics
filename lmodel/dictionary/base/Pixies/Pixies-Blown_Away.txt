<song artist="Pixies" title="Blown_Away">
Now the sun is burning in deepest space
That's the way things are
Through a storm I called you, it fell each day
I didn't get so far, my words get blown away
My lips are moving if you touch my face
Did you hear my screams?
While we were sleeping, I tried to say
Even in my dreams my words get blown away
Now the sun is burning in deepest space
I didn't get so far
