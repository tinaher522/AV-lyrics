<song artist="Tonic" title="Resolve">
I wait for this just like I should
It's what I miss, it's what is good
So give to me just what I need
This one last time
I'll spend my days doing what is right
I will not fall, I will not fall so do be strong
And give to me a quiet and strong resolve
I need it now, my days and my nights are long
I ask of you to bring me home
For all the years that I may know
Please show me love through all my fall
So do not stall
And give to me a quiet and strong resolve
I need it now, my days and my nights are long
Have I come home? Just show me how
Please show me how
And give to me a quiet and strong resolve
I need it now, my days and my nights are long
Have I come home?
