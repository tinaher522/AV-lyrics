<song artist="Tonic" title="Stronger_Than_Mine">
Come on baby walk with me
Come on baby talk with me
Underneath the tree line
Oh
Come on baby lay me down
We don't have to make a sound
Underneath the tree line
Oh
Sister moon's been shining all day
Nothing but blue skies coming our way
Sister moon's been shining all day
You know what I'm saying
Ooh ooh
Sunshine
Ooh ooh
Good time
Ooh ooh
Your mine
No love is stronger that mine
So come on baby make me see
You're the only one for me
Underneath the tree line
Oh
Sister moon's been shining all day
Nothing but blue skies coming our way
Sister moon's been shining all day
You know what I'm saying
Ooh ooh
Sunshine
Ooh ooh
Good time
Ooh ooh
Your mine
No love is stronger that mine
No love is stronger than mine
Ooh ooh
My my
Ooh ooh
Good times
Ooh ooh
My my
Ooh ooh
