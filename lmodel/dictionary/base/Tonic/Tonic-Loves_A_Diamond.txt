<song artist="Tonic" title="Loves_A_Diamond">
Love a man
Who loves a diamond
And holds it softly
In the palm of his hand
Keeps it warm
And holds it directly
Under the pages
Of his heart's command
Love was overrated
Love was hard to find
Love was overrated
I would find
Be it true
Or be it underhanded
I won't harbor
And she won't crawl
Be it real
Or be it underminded
She won't harbor
And I won't stall
Love was overrated
Love was hard to find
Love was overrated
In my time
Love a man
Who loves a diamond
And holds it softly
In the palm of his hand
Keeps it warm
And holds it directly
Under the pages
Of his heart's command
