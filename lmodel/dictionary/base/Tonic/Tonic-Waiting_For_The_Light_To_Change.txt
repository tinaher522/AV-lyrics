<song artist="Tonic" title="Waiting_For_The_Light_To_Change">
Brazen is love's redeemer
When you have so far to go
It loves the true believer
For the innocence they own
Life is good life is grand
When you're sittin' on top of the world
Life is good when it's in your hands
And nobody can change your world
I'm just waiting for the light to change
I'm just waiting for the light to change
I'm just waiting for the light to change
I'm just waiting
All my prize possessions
That I thought I needed so
Dragged me down on a razor
With a heaviness they tow
always searching for a love that's in bloom
it's a warm and soft embrace
Hoping you'll never be lonely again
It's a fear that you just can't face
I'm just waiting for the light to change
I'm just waiting for the light to change
I'm just waiting for the light to change
I'm just waiting
Life is good and life is grand
When you're sitting on top of the world
Life is good when it's in your hands your hands
And nobody can change your world
I'm just waiting for the light to change
I'm just waiting for the light to change
I'm just waiting for the light to change
I'm just waiting for the light to change
I'm just waiting, I'm just waiting
I'm just waiting, I'm just waiting
