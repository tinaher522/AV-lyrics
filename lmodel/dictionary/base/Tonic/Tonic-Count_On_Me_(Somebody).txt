<song artist="Tonic" title="Count_On_Me_(Somebody)">
I need to be around you
I want to fall into your eyes
I love to feel you close to me
But there's no peace of mind
I live to hear you laughing
I long to feel your hands fall down
Along the side of me
A change of life is hard to find
There's no peace of mind
if you ever need somebody
If you ever need somebody to love you
If you ever need somebody
You can count on me
So kiss the thought of leaving
Love me now for always know
i wouldn't let you go
A change of life is hard to find
There's no peace of mind
If you ever need somebody
If you ever need somebody to love you
If you ever need somebody
You can count on me
There's no peace of mind
Change is hard to find
Count on me
If you ever need, if you ever need
If you ever need, if you ever need
If you ever need somebody you can count on me
If you ever need somebody
If you ever need somebody to love you
If you ever need somebody
You can count on me
