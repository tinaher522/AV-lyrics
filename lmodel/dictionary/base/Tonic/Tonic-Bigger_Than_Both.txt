<song artist="Tonic" title="Bigger_Than_Both">
Make up your mind, choose and bear it
If you lose, you can't share it now
Your indecision is self destruction
A little window into your dysfunction now
But you said, you said you want it, whoa
You say, you say, you say you want it, I say
I know, I know it's bigger than both of us
And I trust in this to help me understand
I know, I know, it hurts you like you say
But you say
You say, you say, you say you want it, whoa
You say, you say, you say you want it
When was this about the institution
You beat yourself until there's no solutions now
It got so bad, you can't see it
You're in so far, you can't leave it now, now
But you say
You say, you want it, whoa
You say, you say, you say you want it, I say
I know, I know it's bigger than both of us
And I trust in this to help me understand
I know, I know it hurts you like you say
But you say
You say, you say, you say you want it, whoa
Say, you say, you say you want it, whoa, whoa, say
You say, you say, you say you want it
You say, you say, you say you want it, I say
I know, I know it's bigger than both of us
And I trust in this to help me understand
I know, I know it hurts you like you say
And you say
You say, you say, you say you want it, whoa
Say, you say, you say you want it, whoa
