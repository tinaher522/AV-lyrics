<song artist="Tonic" title="On_Your_Feet_Again">
I'll pick you up beneath the stars
When you slowly fade
Beneath the blue skies above
We'll all look the same
You just need something
To get you on your feet again
You picked a life that you can't trust
And it makes you mad
And all along you wonder why
You just feel sad
If you feel like love
Can get you on your feet again
You just need something 
To get you on your feet again
Did they give you more than your life could keep
Does it speak to you when you fall asleep
Can you walk away from all that you know
Could you hide the strength
Would you let it show
If you feel like love
Can get you on your feet again
You just need something 
To get you on your feet again
I'll pick you up beneath the stars
When you slowly fade
Beneath the blue skies above
We'll all look the same
