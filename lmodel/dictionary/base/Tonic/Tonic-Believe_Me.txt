<song artist="Tonic" title="Believe_Me">
Love, I hope you won't be late
You know, how much I hate to wait
Believe, my heart is in your hands
And our life is like a song
When you sing along
Baby let it go
Believe me, believe me
I would wait forever and more
For that open door
Believe me, believe me
Life, is more than we can know
Faith, is something we can show
I would love, I would lie
I would give, I would die
Cause our life is like a song 
When you sing along
Baby let it go
Believe me, believe me
I would wait forever and more
For that open door
Believe me, believe me
Sometimes we draw the line
And people remain where they don't belong
It so easy to say what you need
Sometimes it just goes away
When you sing along
Baby let it go
Believe me, believe me
I would wait forever and more
For that open door
Believe me, believe me
It so easy to say what you need
Sometimes it just goes away
