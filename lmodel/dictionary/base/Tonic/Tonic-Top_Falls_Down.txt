<song artist="Tonic" title="Top_Falls_Down">
He lays down in silence
Killing communication
Any pride is pointless
In these situations
So she's gonna find a rider
Because she can't love a radio flyer
Ooh you never give love
So the top falls down
Spread your wings and fly away
My love
She said she's gotta have her freedom
From the one who denies her
From the builder of strong fences
From the one who kills his senses
When you're sleeping under water
Breathing has no purpose
She said she's looking for a rider
Because she can't love a radio flyer
Ooh you never give love
So the top falls down
Spread your wings and fly away
My love
Oh to look into the sun
To see the shame in everyone
So back I stand from want so near
To be controlled by what I fear
Ooh you never give love
So the top falls down
Spread your wings and fly away
My love
