<song artist="Tonic" title="Torn_To_Pieces">
I, I can't undo things that are not true
You, you can't say things are gonna change
It's a hand that will drag you under
It's a deep that takes you to a hurt that grows
My love is gone and you can't go on
My life is torn to pieces, my life is torn
No, no one will ever see what this did to me
It's hard enough not to grieve what you can't be
It's a deep that will take you to a hurt that grows
My life is gone and you can't go on
My life is torn to pieces, my life is torn
My life is gone, you can't go on
My life is torn to pieces
My life is torn to pieces, my life is torn
