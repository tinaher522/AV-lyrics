<song artist="Tonic" title="Head_On_Straight">
I don't wanna be the one who hurts you
I don't wanna be the one who fails
Im keeping my head on straight
So you can trust me again
I struggled all my life with empty moments
The shadow of a hole I'll never fill
Any happiness I had was empty
It wasn't good enough, I wanted Love!
(chorus)
I'm keeping my head on straight
So you can trust me again
Im keeping my head on straight
So you can trust me again
I dont wanna think of life without you
I dont wanna take a step alone
It scares me to think I almost lost you
Just let me know you're fine, Im on the line
(chorus)
I'm keeping my head on straight
So you can trust me again
Im keeping my head on straight
So you can trust me again
Im thinking of our whole life, baby
Won't you help me find a way
Im thinking of our whole life, baby
Won't you help me find a way
I dont wanna be the one who hurts you
I just wanna know that you're alright
(chorus)I'm keeping my head on straight
So you can trust me again
Im keeping my head on straight
So you can trust me again
You can trust me again,
Trust me again
