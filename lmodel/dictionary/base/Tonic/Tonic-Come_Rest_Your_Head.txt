<song artist="Tonic" title="Come_Rest_Your_Head">
Trust, I know, is not such a dirty word
Trust is something that I have barely heard
Honesty is not so far away
Empty words are all you'll have to say
We all go on
Just let me go on
Come rest your head
Come stay with me a while
You'd be better off here
Come stay with me a while
Truth, you'll find, is the only way to live
Long for when you can learn to forgive
We all go on
Just let me go on
Come rest your head
Come stay with me a while
You'd be better off here
Come stay with me a while
Trust I know is not such a dirty word
Something that I have barely heard
Honesty is not so far away
Empty words are all you have to say
We all go on
Just let me go on
Come rest your head
Come stay with me a while
You'd be better off here
Come stay with me a while
Come rest your head
