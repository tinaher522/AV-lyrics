<song artist="Tonic" title="Release_Me">
Come and release me, sender
Come and release me, I will go
It's a part of me to show
Come and release me, silence
Come and release me so I'll know
When it's time to let it go
I want to know
Where the deeper parts of life will grow
I want to see
Where's the deeper part of love in me
Where's that part of love in me?
Come and release me, anger
Come and release me so I'll see
All the things that I don't need
Come and release me, sadness
Come and release me let me go
It's a thing that I can't show
I want to know
Where the deeper parts of love will grow
I want to see
Where's the deeper part of love in me
Where's the part of love in me?
Where's the part that died in me?
Come and release me
Come and release me
I want to know
Where the deeper parts of life will grow
I want to see
Where's the deeper part of love in me
Where's the part of love in me?
Where's the part of love in me?
