<song artist="Tonic" title="Knock_Down_Walls">
You killed me when you came walking down the sidewalk
Saying everything was fine
Dressed up like a wife of a life I'll never have It's so easy to fool me
You can turn me on
You can turn me off
I've had enough of that little boy sandbox stuff
Love you wanted to try
For a life you're willing to buy
I
Knock down walls for you
Cause I need you
You always grab a hold of the ones you know you can change
Just a group of loner zeros who will play your game
Something tells them that their luck is gonna change
Round and round you drag them down
So don't tell me I've gone crazy
You're the one who's trying to fuckin change me
I
Knock down walls for you
Cause I need you
I
Knock down walls for you
Cause I want you
Hurt me, break me make me fall
Crush my heart force me to crawl
Show me love is never real
The wait is worth the pain you feel
Life you wanted to try
For a love you're willing to buy
I
Knock down walls for you
Cause I need you
I
Knock down walls for you
Cause I need you
I knock down walls for you
I Need you
