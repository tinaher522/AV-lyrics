<song artist="Tonic" title="Take_Me_As_I_Am">
I never knew my father
I never knew his pain
Or that an empty home life
Would break him down again
So when I feel like running
I have to look inside
I wanna find the answers
I wanna break my line
Fear falls down like rain
And it makes me whole again
Fear falls like rain
Take me as I am
I'm not broken
Pieces of my life
Are not tokens
I wanna let you know
That I'm still learning
How to love again
And stop hurting
I wanna roll my darkness
Into a million suns
I need to find forgiveness
When all the pain is done
I wanna hear I'm sorry
I wanna let you go
I have to find my own life
I wanna learn to grow
Fear falls down like rain
And it makes me whole again
Fear falls like rain
Take me as I am
I'm not broken
Pieces of my life
Are not tokens
I wanna let you know
That I'm still learning
How to love again
And stop hurting
Oh, yeah
And it makes me whole again
Take me as I am
I'm not broken
Pieces of my life
Are not tokens
I wanna let you know
That I'm still learning
How to love again
And stop hurting
And stop hurting
