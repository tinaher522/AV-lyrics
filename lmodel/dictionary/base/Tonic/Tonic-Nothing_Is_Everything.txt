<song artist="Tonic" title="Nothing_Is_Everything">
If you can't see this, if you can't be this
Maybe it will come back to where you thought it left you
So if you can't see love and if you can't be loved
Baby, it'll haunt you and everything you will do
'Cause you're not going home
Everything, everything has changed
So we run and we try to erase the words
We can't take back again
So if you can't see this, if you can't be this
It may never come back to where you thought it left you
So if you can't find love that you can want enough
Baby, it will haunt you now and everything you can't do
'Cause you're not going home
Everything, everything has changed
So we run and we try to erase the words
We can't take back again
So if you can't find love or you can't be loved
Maybe you should go back to where you thought it left you
So if you won't see this, if you can't be this
Maybe you should come back where everything was nothing
