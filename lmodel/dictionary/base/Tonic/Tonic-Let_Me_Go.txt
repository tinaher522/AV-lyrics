<song artist="Tonic" title="Let_Me_Go">
Home, home is like an open road
Where you will always find
Whatever you've been looking for
And grace, always in a hollow place
I will never change and I will always stay my way
People scatter, when loves the matter
I won't let it show
Let me go
Let me go away again
Let me change my direction
I can't take that rejection again
Let me go, let me go
I'll find my own
Way, I never thought I'd change my ways
It was an angry thought
That made me turn the other way
And I, I wanna be like that again
When I know there's hope
And hope will always find a friend
People scatter, when loves the matter
I won't let it show
Let me go
Let me go away again
Let me change my direction
I won't take that rejection 
Let me go, let me go
I'll find my own way home
Let me go
Let me go away again
Let me change my direction
I won't take that rejection 
Let me go, let me go
I'll find my own way home
