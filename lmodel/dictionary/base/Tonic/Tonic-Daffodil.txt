<song artist="Tonic" title="Daffodil">
Keep me under your bones
Walk with me when you roam
Isn't it crazy how we learn to return?
Isn't it crazy how we run to trust it?
So don't leave me here holding daffodils
It all seems clear when I'm lying still
Though you never will
Keep me under your style
Walk with me down the aisle
Isn't it crazy how we learn to return?
Isn't it crazy how we run to trust it?
So don't leave me here holding daffodils
It all seems clear when I'm lying still
Though you never will, daffodil
I will not fall
I will not fall, I will not
So don't leave me here holding daffodils
It all seems clear when I'm lying still
Though I never will, daffodil
