<song artist="Tonic" title="Drag_Me_Down">
There's a reason why the words got
Hard for me to bare
Because within them was the promise of
A life that just wasn't there
You're not my friend and I have no doubt
That I finally figured it out
You're gonna drag me down
You're trying to drag me down
You're gonna drag me down
You're trying to drag me down
Was it hate or was it hurt
that led you to be this way
Did you want it all for nothing
Did you think that would be OK
I did everything I could for you
Still you wanna run me through
You're gonna drag me down
You're trying to drag me down
You're gonna drag me down
You're trying to drag me down
I did everything I could for you
Still you wanna run me through
You're gonna drag me down
You're trying to drag me down
You're gonna drag me down
You're trying to drag me down
You're gonna drag me down
You're trying to drag me down
You're gonna drag me down
You're trying to drag me down
Yeah yeah yeah
Trying to drag me down
