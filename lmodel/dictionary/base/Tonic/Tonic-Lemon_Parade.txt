<song artist="Tonic" title="Lemon_Parade">
I wish I'd seen you as a little girl
Without your armor to fend off the world
I would have kept you underneath my wing
I would protect you from everything
Make way for the lemon parade
Make way for my girl
Make way for the lemon parade
Make way for my girl
Did the boys all tease you
When they had the chance
Always left standing
When it came time to dance
Did you hide behind your books girl
Did you find your secret friends
Always I'll want you
Always 'till the end
Make way for the lemon parade
Make way for my girl
Make way for the lemon parade
Make way for my girl
Make way for the lemon parade
Make way for my girl
Make way for the lemon parade
Make way for my girl
Make way for my girl
