<song artist="Tonic" title="Do_You_Know">
Underneath the weight
of a heavy sky
I will grow my wings
I will learn to fly
Cuz even though my heart is big enough to fly away 
underneath the confidence well i will never say i'm strong enough 
to be alone
Do you know?
Do you know?
Do you know how it feels to be angry?
Do you know how it feels to be hurt?
When you live all your life for a moment
just to prove that you know what its worth
Do you know?
I will show no fear
I won't hide my scars
I will learn to give
I will love whats ours
Cuz even though my heart is big enough to fly away 
underneath the confidence well i will never say i'm strong enough 
to be alone
Do you know?
Do you know?
Do you know how it feels to be angry?
Do you know how it feels to be hurt?
When you live all your life for a moment
just to prove that you know what its worth?
when you trust in appearing tomorrow
when you learn to forgive every day
all the times that you thought could be trusted
in the end they could all fall away. 
Cuz even though my heart is big enough to fly away i'm strong enough 
to be alone, yeah alone
Do you know?
Do you know?
Do you know how it feels to be angry?
Do you know how it feels to be hurt?
When you live all your life for a moment
just to prove that you know what its worth?
when you trust in appearing tomorrow
when you learn to forgive every day
all the times that you thought could be trusted
in the end they could all fall away.
