<song artist="Tonic" title="Open_Up_Your_Eyes">
Choosing stones
Big enough to drag me down
Where I am People's voices make hollow sounds
Just be quiet,they'll go away
Open up your eyes
Don't let your mind tell the story here
Open up your eyes
Just let me go
It's so safe, It's so safe floating in the glass
While above, While above all your troubles pass
Just be quite They'll go away
Open up your eyes, Don't let your mind tell the story here
Open up your eyes Just let me go
( lead )
Open up your eyes Don't let your mind tell the story here
Open up your eyes Just let me go ,let me go ,let me go
Open up your eyes Just let me go
