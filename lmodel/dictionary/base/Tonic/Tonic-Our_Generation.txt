<song artist="Tonic" title="Our_Generation">
You're coming up like a flower
You're coming up through the cracks that live round here
Everybody knows we have no fear
This is my generation
Cuz' we just wanna dance all night
Live inside the spark of light
This might be the only time around
We wanna know the face of freedom
We wanna make place where we can learn to love
Build a world that we can be proud of
This is my generation
