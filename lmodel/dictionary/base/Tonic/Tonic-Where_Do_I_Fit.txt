<song artist="Tonic" title="Where_Do_I_Fit">
Where do I fit inside of it?
Where do I stand? What is the plan?
I long to see the sympathy
That lives inside of you
I want to be more simple, oh
But what is the plan for all of this?
Where do I crawl? Where is the wall?
I long to see the sympathy
That lives inside of you
I want to be more simple, oh
Long night's strain
Teach us change from fear
I live to see the sympathy
That lives inside of you
I long to be more simple, oh
What is the plan inside of here?
