<song artist="Lianne_La_Havas" title="Lost_&_Found">
Come upstairs and i'll show you where all my
Where my demons hide from you
Just look at who I have become I am so ashamed
You were the one that made me feel the way I do
You broke me and taught me
to truly hate myself
unfold me and teach me how to be
like somebody else
and I felt strong enough
I was discovered by the love
I had been waiting for so long
You told me none of that was real
I can not hide how low I feel
To know that you were never wrong
You broke me and taught me
to truly hate myself
Unfold me and teach me
How to be like somebody else
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh eey yeaah
You are lost and found
Falling out my babe
Broken down
Broken down
You broke me and taught me
to truly hate myself
Unfold me and teach me
How to be like somebody else
You broke me and taught me to
Truly hate myself
Unfold me and teach me
How to be like somebody else
