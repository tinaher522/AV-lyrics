<song artist="Lianne_La_Havas" title="Everything_Everything">
I can use my head again
I always suffered then
My heart is stolen, let it show
But I'll run forever more
You know there's not a soul alive
Who understands you like I do
It's okay my love, no need to explain
There's nothing to say
Your eyes said it all, all, all (All, all, all)
I'm not looking away
Your eyes hold everything, everything, mm
We should learn to breathe again
Before we suffocate
All this talk but even then
We ex-communicate
I've never known another love
Who looks at me the way you do
And sees the light,
The dark,
The truth
And my real name
You know there's not a soul alive
Could understand you like I do
Its okay my love, no need to explain, oh
There's nothing to say
Your eyes said it all, all, all (All, all, all)
I'm not looking away
Your eyes hold everything, everything
There's nothing to say
Your eyes said it all, all, all (All, all, all)
I'm not looking away
Your eyes hold everything, everything
They told everything, everything, oh
(Can use, can use my head again)
