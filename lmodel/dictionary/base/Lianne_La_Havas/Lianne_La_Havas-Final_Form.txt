What is that incessant humming? Coming from your manga maw?
Oh, you breathe twin towers, oh, you gave your powers up.
And I can't teach you how to stop it, and you can't make me understand
Break, the withered habit, mm, I need your rabid smile
Your home, (with the family wife and child and wife and)
Your head, (days in the cemetery come the calm the calm the)
Take form, (Time as your figure becomes the stone the stone your)
First body, last body
I wish the summer was over us in bursts
We're in the middle of nothing we can hold
And the sewers erupting life in gold
I'm gonna happen and happen until my whole give up the ghost
I'm gonna renew my sinew until my cells divide no more
So lean me up and take a picture, I can't move my legs and arms
It's too much information, too - much to be thinking of
And each of us have separate houses, and each of us have separate souls
And some of us do nothing, some - some of us do nothing more
Your home, (sleep as your figure becomes the stone, the stone, the)
Your head, (time with the family, sleep the wheel, the tomb, the)
Take form, (dance with the atrophy cold and warm and warm your)
First body, last body
I wish the cesspit would open like a bible
I wish the rotten would blossom with the tidal
And, I've never been able to divide us
I'm gonna wrestle and wrangle until my legs become unreal
I'm gonna stumble and scramble my way to lactic ecstasy
Yet while I can slumber, rest, move so slowly
It's creeping across his chest, like some cold weed
He's not as afraid as me, like some dancer.
I wish the cesspit would open like a bible
I wish the rotten would blossom with the tidal
And, I've never been able to divide us
I'm gonna wrestle and wrangle until my legs become unreal
I'm gonna stumble and scramble my way to lactic ecstasy
I wish the summer was over us in bursts
We're in the middle of nothing we can hold
And the sewers erupting life in gold
I'm gonna happen and happen until my whole give up the ghost
I'm gonna travel and travel until my cells divide no more
