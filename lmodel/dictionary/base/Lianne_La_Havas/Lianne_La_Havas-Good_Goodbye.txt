<song artist="Lianne_La_Havas" title="Good_Goodbye">
Old man, let me wipe your eyes
I've never seen you cry
Old friend, in our own sweet time
We'll say a good goodbye
All my life I know by now
All these memories, too much to lose
No one ever leaves you
I don't need faith, I don't need truth
No one ever leaves you
You'd say this is all there is
And every time you'd blink
You'd miss another piece of this wondrous world
All I'd ask is why you'd leave so soon
Everybody seems to
I don't need faith I just want you
No one ever leaves you
Everybody raise a glass here's to a good goodbye
Everybody raise a glass here's to a good goodbye
Everybody raise a glass here's to a good goodbye
Oh, everybody raise a glass, oh
All these memories too much to lose
No one ever leaves you
I don't need faith I don't need truth
No one ever leaves you
I don't need faith I just want proof
