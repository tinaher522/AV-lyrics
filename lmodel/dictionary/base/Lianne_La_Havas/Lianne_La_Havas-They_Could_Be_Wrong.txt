<song artist="Lianne_La_Havas" title="They_Could_Be_Wrong">
The way you look when you're sleeping
The way you breathe when you're leaving
I know you know then I'm not myself
Mm, and when you're home feel your footsteps
I count alone in the darkness
In the darkness
They say our love won't last forever
They could be wrong
And when they say our love won't last forever
They could be wrong
They could be wrong
The way you smile when I'm speaking
I feel how clearly you see me
How clearly you see me
They say our love won't last forever
They could be wrong
And when they say our love won't last forever
They could be wrong
They could be wrong
They could be wrong
They could be wrong
(Ooh)
We could be wrong
Hear me out
Just hear me out
Oh hear me out
Just hear me out
Oh hear me out
Just hear me out
Oh hear me out
Just hear me out
(They say our love won't last forever)
Hear me now
Just hear me now
Oh hear me now
Don't push me out
(They say our love won't last forever)
Oh hear me now
Don't push me out
Oh hear me now
They say our love
Oh they could be wrong
Yeah they could be wrong
We proved ourselves wrong
They say our love won't last forever
They say our love won't last forever
