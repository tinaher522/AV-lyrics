<song artist="Lianne_La_Havas" title="Never_Get_Enough">
I heard a song today
On the tip of your tongue
And when I hear you play
That particular song
I go, and you stay
As I lay wide awake
Thinking 'what the hell have I done?'
Enchanted by the way you dance
At the kick of my drum
I'll go, and you stay
There must be another way
No I'll never get enough of you
But your love like stop it's amazing
Doesn't matter what you've been through, through
'Cause I'll never get enough of you
But your love like stop it's amazing
Doesn't matter what you've been through, through
Gave you the runaround?
Baby, what the hell do I do
Bewildered by the sound
Only if it's coming from you
Okay, you paid
I've been unsatisfied
Lately when I think about us
I've swallowed so much pride
To win a little bit of your trust
You go, and I'll stay
There must be a better way
No I'll never get enough of you
But your love like stop it's amazing
Doesn't matter what you've been through, through
'Cause I'll never get enough of you
But your love like stop it's amazing
Doesn't matter what you've been through, through
And the way you got me
The way you got me up
I can't see down
It's real now, it's real now
I can't see now
'Cause I'll never get enough of you
But your love like stop it's amazing
Doesn't matter what you've been through, through
No I'll never get enough of you
But your love like stop it's amazing
Doesn't matter what you've been through, through
