<song artist="Lianne_La_Havas" title="Night_School">
So far, solo
He took a light
Twisted my arms, I couldn't learn to fight
The last known pupil with the teacher of the night
Gave him my soul, familiar price
He knew I'd follow
But I'm the fool too blind to realize
That I'd been silenced by the teacher of the night
I had to take his life
My soul shown too bright
She did what she thought to be right
He took my voice, had nothing left
Gave me no choice I'd have to cheat to pass his unfair test
Before I knew it I'd been taught to fear the light
So I had to take his life
My soul shown too bright
She did what she thought to be right
Before the daylight came
I drowned his heart in shame
I broke his arms and legs
Now he;s as good as dead
But oh how he still begs
To trade my soul for light
If I bring him back to life
But I should've known he'd lie
