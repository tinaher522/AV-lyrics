<song artist="Lianne_La_Havas" title="Is_Your_Love_Big_Enough?">
Found myself in a second
I found myself in a secondhand guitar
Never thought it would happen
But I found myself in a secondhand guitar
So I've just got to know
I truly have to know
So you've got to let me know
Is your love big enough for what's to come?
Got so hot in the city
That I forgot everything I was looking for
Made my way to the dance floor
And I danced 'til I wasn't drunk anymore
So I've just got to know
I truly have to know
So you've got to let me know
Is your love big enough for what's to come?
Baby, let me know
Is your love big enough for past is done?
Baby, let me know
Underground, underground
With the friends I've found
Friends I've found
Underground, underground
With the friends I've found
Friends I've found
I scream, I scream on Second Avenue
I scream on Second Avenue
Is your love big enough for what's to come?
Baby, let me know
Is your love big enough for past is done?
Won't you let me know?
Is your love big enough for what's to come?
Is your love big enough, big enough?
Is your love big enough for what's to come?
Won't you let me know?
Is your love big enough for past is done?
Baby, let me know
Is your love big enough for what's to come?
Is your love big enough for what's to come?
