<song artist="Lianne_La_Havas" title="Wonderful">
Did the world get a little bit colder
Not wiser just a little bit older
So slow that we're bound to fall over, oh
Did the heart grow a little bit harder
Too much, too late, too far, too gone
But wasn't it kind of wonderful
Wasn't it kind of wonderful, baby
Wasn't it kind of wonderful, baby
Wasn't it kind of wonderful, wonderful
You can trip, flick a switch like a thief
Break the circuit between us
But electricity lingers
In our fingers
Oh you can burn every fuse and refuse
Turn your positive minus
Electricity lingers
In our fingers
From here there's nothing but horizon
Near dawn, I'm searching for the sunrise
Remember when you put the stars into my eyes, oh
Wasn't it kind of wonderful
Wasn't it kind of wonderful, baby
Wasn't it kind of wonderful, wonderful
You can trip, flick a switch like a thief
Break the circuit between us
But electricity lingers
In our fingers
Oh you can burn every fuse and refuse
Turn your positive minus
Electricity lingers
In our fingers
Wasn't it kind of wonderful
Wasn't it kind of wonderful, baby
Wasn't it kind of wonderful, wonderful
Wasn't it kind of wonderful
Wasn't it kind of wonderful, baby
Wasn't it kind of wonderful, wonderful
