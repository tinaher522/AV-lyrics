<song artist="Lianne_La_Havas" title="Tease_Me">
A dream never stops
But I see the end before I wake up
Ooh, a dream never wins, no
So I pray for yesterday
And I haven't slept a wink since
I never know what I want, what I need
So I think its best you stay away from me
'Cause I hate the way you tease me
I am not lonely, I'm alright
But you sure don't make it easy
To show my hand and say, "goodnight"
Try anything
But it's me who takes the blame
If I sing, ooh
Will I try again?
No, I've received my faithful end
How did I let this shit happen?
I never know what I want, what I need
So I think its best you stay away from me
'Cause I hate the way you tease me
I am not lonely, I'm alright
But you sure don't make it easy
To show my hand and say, "goodnight"
Will I try again? No
I hate the way you tease me
I am not lonely, I'm alright
But you sure don't make it easy
To show my hand and say, "goodbye"
I never let my guard down
So why did I let it slide for you?
I know it so wrong, but somehow
There's nothin' I could say, or do, or do
