<song artist="Lianne_La_Havas" title="Don't_Wake_Me_Up">
Don't wake me up
Trying to find you
Oh, as I walk through
You're hiding in the corners of my mind
Never fear, I'll be close behind
My only love, I follow behind you
Won't go without you
I know your love weighs heavy on my heart
But you are my only counterpart
Well I know
Why I lost control
Of my heart and soul
'Cause I know you,
I can reach through, all alone
I make mistakes but they're safely behind me
Now I can run free
The only true love I have ever known
Into yours my life has been thrown
Still, I only think so
It's just the beginning
Sing when you're willing
They say somethings are better left unsaid
But I'd take my life to stay in your bed
Well I know,
Why I lost control
Of my heart and soul
'Cause I know you
I can reach through
