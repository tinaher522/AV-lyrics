<song artist="Lianne_La_Havas" title="Midnight">
Mm, a long and lonely journey to my hideaway,
And I know they'll try to turn me with the things that they say,
But no one knows where I'll go when I walk away,
So come now, hurry, hurry, don't miss this train...
Open up and let me get to you, take you to another side;
Come to my world (after midnight...)
Mm. We're getting lost in another time, your hand in mine,
In my own world, on my own time, maybe that's why...
(I don't mind...) People think I'm crazy - Lately, I'm
(I'll be fine...) Living in midnight, just living in midnight...
(Oh, oh...) And if you think I'm crazy, pay it no mind;
(Oh, oh...) We're living in midnight, just living in midnight...
Oh, if you could see what I've seen, you would dare to dream;
Honey, if you care to join me, come meet the team...
And you all could be my army - there's no other way;
So come now, hurry, hurry, don't miss this train!
(I don't mind...) People think I'm crazy - Lately, I'm
(I'll be fine...) Living in midnight, just living in midnight...
(Oh, oh...) And if you think I'm crazy, pay it no mind;
(Oh, oh...) You'll never know the places I go when I'm alone...
If only for a moment, only for a while, mmm,
'Cause I belong to the unknown, hope to be alright...
(Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh...)
(I don't mind...) People think I'm crazy - Lately, I'm
(I'll be fine...) Living in midnight, just living in midnight...
(Oh, oh...) And if you think I'm crazy, pay it no mind;
(Oh, oh...) We're living in midnight, just living in midnight...
(I don't mind...) People think I'm crazy - Lately, I'm
(I'll be fine...) Living in midnight, just living in midnight...
(Oh, oh...) And if you think I'm crazy, pay it no mind;
(Oh, oh...) You'll never know the places I go when I'm alone...
