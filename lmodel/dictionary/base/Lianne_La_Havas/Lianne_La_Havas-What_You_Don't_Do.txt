<song artist="Lianne_La_Havas" title="What_You_Don't_Do">
Heavy words, little lies
Telling everything but the truth, the truth
Three little words over time overheard and overused, used
No sweet nothing could ever be turned into something new
No grand gesture could ever be made to measure you
I know what I got and I know where we're going
You don't need to show it, I already know it all
It's what you don't do, it's what you don't say
(It's what you don't do) I know you love me, I don't need proof
It's what you don't do, the games you don't play
(It's what you don't do) I know you love me, I don't need proof
I've been saving up my time so I could spend it all on you, on you
Oh, all I need is to see you smile; I've forgotten how to be blue, blue
I know what I got and I know where we're going
You don't need to show it, I already know it all
It's what you don't do, it's what you don't say
(It's what you don't do) I know you love me, I don't need proof
It's what you don't do, the games you don't play
(It's what you don't do) I know you love me, I don't need proof
Don't tell the whole world; just wanna be your girl
(It's what you don't do, it's what you don't do)
The closer we get, oh
The less we need to show
I know what I got and I know where we're going
You don't need to show it, I already know it all
It's what you don't do, it's what you don't say
(It's what you don't do) I know you love me, I don't need proof
It's what you don't do, the games you don't play
(It's what you don't do) I know you love me, I don't need proof
Won't tell the whole world; just wanna be your girl
(It's what you don't do) I know you love me, I don't need proof
It's what you don't do, it's what you don't say
(It's what you don't do, it's what you don't do)
Oh, the closer we get, oh
The less we need to show
