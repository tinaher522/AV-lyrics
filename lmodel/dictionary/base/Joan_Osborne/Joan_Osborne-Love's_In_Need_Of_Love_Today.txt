<song artist="Joan_Osborne" title="Love's_In_Need_Of_Love_Today">
Good morn or evening friends
Here's your friendly announcer
I have serious news to pass on to every-body
What I'm about to say
Could mean the world's disaster
Could change your joy and laughter to tears and pain
It's that love's in need of love today
Don't delay, send yours in right away
Hate's goin' round breaking many hearts
Stop it please before it's gone too far
The force of evil plans
To make you its possession
And it will if we let it
Destroy everybody
We all must take
Precautionary measures
If love and peace you treasure
Then you'll hear me when I say
Oh that love's in need of love today
Love's in need of love today
Don't delay Don't delay
Send yours in right away, right away
Hate's goin' round breaking many hearts
Stop it please before it's gone too far
Gone too far
People you know that
Love's in need of love today
Love's in need of love today
Don't delay send yours in right away
You know that hate's, hate's goin' round
Breaking many hearts
Stop, stop it please before it's gone too far
It's up to you cause
Love's in need of love today
Don't delay send yours in right away
You know that hate's, hate's goin' round
Breaking, hate's tried to break my heart many times
Don't you've got to stop it please
Before before before it's gone too far
Love's in need of love love today
Don't delay send yours in right away
You know that hate's goin' around
And it tried to break up many hearts
You've got to 
I've got to 
They've got to stop it before it's gone too far
Love's love's in need of love
Did you ever think that love would be in need of love today
Don't delay
Hate's goin' round
Bring it down a little love is very peaceful
So bring it down a little
Just give the world LOVE
