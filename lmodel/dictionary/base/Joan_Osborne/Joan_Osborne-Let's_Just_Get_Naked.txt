<song artist="Joan_Osborne" title="Let's_Just_Get_Naked">
"I know what you're hiding from me
You know what I'm hiding from you
I know that you hurt me real bad
You know that I hurt you bad, too
Let's just get naked, just for a laugh
Let's just get naked
It's a trip and a half
Here comes that story again, all about that television show
Here comes my typical response
Won't you tell me something I don't know? 
And I'm pissed off about being the cops and 
you're pissed off about being the maid
And how long 'til they shut off the phone or 
'til the next time we get laid? 
Let's just get naked, just for a laugh
Let's just get naked
It's a trip and a half, trip and a half
We've been together so long
I hope it wasn't just the drugs
What happened to the energy we had, 
the morning glories and the rodeo hugs
And I know you like the back of my hand 
with a stamp that says I paid to get in. 
And yes I am your television show
And you're the nicest place I've ever been
Let's just get naked, just for a laugh
Let's just get naked
It wouldn't be so bad
Let's just get naked, just for a laugh
Let's just get naked
It's a trip and a half, trip and a half
Let's just get naked, just for a laugh"
