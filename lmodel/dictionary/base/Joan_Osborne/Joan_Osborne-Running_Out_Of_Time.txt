<song artist="Joan_Osborne" title="Running_Out_Of_Time">
Can you see me rising since your
Disappearance safe to say
That I've regained myself
Sleeping like a baby still I wonder maybe
If we'll ever
Meet up somewhere else
I'm bouncing you a message
Off the night sky
You'll get it in a while
How you walk around with all that
Contempt inside you I'm
Amazed that you can stand up straight
Turned up the volume when you heard
Me saying to you how
Does somebody switch from love to hate
I'm bouncing you a message
Off the night sky
You'll get it in a while
I know you feel it
It's right behind you
It's getting closer
You said yourself
You're running out of time
If I ever sit to write the story
I'll say something nice
About you when you're dead
Moving like the ocean
Safe inside the notion that I can
Read it layin' in my bed
I'm bouncing you a message
Off the night sky
You'll get it in a while
I know you feel it
It's right behind you
It's getting closer
You said yourself
You're running out of time
Yes it's complicated if the feelings faded
Still it's better
To have no regrets
When you think about me if you think
About me please
Remember that I've done my best
Can you see me rising since your
Disappearance,safe to say
That I've regained myself
Crawling like a baby.
Still I wonder maybe if we'll ever
Meet up somewhere else cause...
I know you feel it
It's right behind you
It's getting closer
You said yourself
You're running out of time
