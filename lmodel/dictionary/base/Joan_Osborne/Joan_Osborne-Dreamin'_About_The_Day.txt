<song artist="Joan_Osborne" title="Dreamin'_About_The_Day">
The sun goes down too early 
The wind goes down my back just like it owns me 
I work my job I get my check 
I'm tryin' not to let myself get lonely 
I'm just dreamin' about the day that I can 
Show you all the love I've got for you 
I used to hear my heart cry out 
I used to feel it pound in me 
I used to think It'd break me right in two 
Now that seems so long ago 
I'm feelin' like there's nothin' I can't do 
I'm just dreamin' about the day when I can 
Show you all the love I've got for you 
Sometimes I can see your face 
Taste your lovin' in my mouth 
Baby I am comin' back for more 
Can't you feel me comin' 
Can't you see me comin' 
Can't you hear me knockin' on your door? 
I'm just dreamin' about the day when I can 
Show you all the love I've got for you 
I've got so much love for you
