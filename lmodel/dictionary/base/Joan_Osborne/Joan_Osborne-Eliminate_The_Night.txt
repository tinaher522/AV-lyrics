<song artist="Joan_Osborne" title="Eliminate_The_Night">
I don't wanna be the other woman
I know you're not the cheatin' kind
But I see you every night in a fever dream
I just can't get you out of my mind
I'll be alright
If you eliminate the night
I'll be okay
Take all these burnin' hours away
Oh, eliminate, eliminate the night
No other man in this room tonight, no other man in this town
Make me say these wicked words, make me lay my conscience down
Oh honey when it comes to you, I ain't got no shame
You can have me any way you like, you can call me by her name
I'll be alright
If you eliminate the night
I'll be okay
Take all these burnin' hours away
Oh, eliminate, eliminate the night
There's a lot o' men on the floor tonight and gonna give 'em each a dance
But I'm makin' my every move for you, I'm ridin' on your every glance
I could leave in the mornin' before you awake and I really wouldn't mind to pretend
That I never held you and you can go on home and this'll never happen again
I'll be alright
If you eliminate the night
I'll be okay
Take all these burnin' hours away
I'll be alright
If you eliminate the night
I'll be okay
Take all these burnin' hours away
Oh, eliminate, eliminate the night
Oh, eliminate, eliminate the night
Oh, eliminate, eliminate the night
