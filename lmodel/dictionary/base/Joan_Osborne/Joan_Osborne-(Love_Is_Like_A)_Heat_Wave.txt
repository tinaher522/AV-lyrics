<song artist="Joan_Osborne" title="(Love_Is_Like_A)_Heat_Wave">
Whenever I'm with him, something inside
Starts to burning and I'm filled with desire
Could it be the devil in me
Or is this the way love's supposed to be?
It's like a heatwave burning in my heart
Can't keep from crying, it's tearing me apart
Whenever he calls my name, soft, slow, sweet and plain
I feel, right there, I feel that burning pain
Has a high blood pressure got a hold on me
Or is this the way love's supposed to be?
It's like a heatwave burning in my heart
Can't keep from crying, it's tearing me apart
Sometimes I stare into space, tears all over my face
Can't explain it, don't understand it, I ain't never felt like this before
Now that funny feeling has me amazed
Don't know what to do, my head's in a haze
It's like a heatwave
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Oh ohh, yeah yeah, oh ohh
I'm feeling, I'm burning
I feel a burning in my heart like a heatwave
Heatwave, heatwave
Oh, I'm feeling
I'm feeling, I'm feeling
Like a heatwave
