<song artist="Joan_Osborne" title="Poison_Apples_(Hallelujah)">
Your memory comes back to me
To strangle me with its sweet taste
See God would never be so cruel
To make me live without your face
Now that I have made you crawl
It does you good to see me fall
Like poison apples from the tree
As heavy as a honey bee
Hallelujah
I gave you away so easily
It makes me wonder why
Moving through you every night
The lovely girls in dresses tight
The angels dancing on a pin
The people we are downing in
Like a needle going in
Into the shining city skin
Oh I recall the moment when you ruined me for other men
Hallelujah
I gave you away so easily
It makes me wonder why
If I die before you do
Believe me I'll be haunting you
I'll come upon you while you sleep
To drown you in a kiss
So deep
