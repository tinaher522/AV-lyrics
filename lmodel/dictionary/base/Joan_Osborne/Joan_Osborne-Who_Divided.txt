<song artist="Joan_Osborne" title="Who_Divided">
I get into my car
Turn the radio on
Drive by your house, your window, your bed
Since we've been over and done
Ah, but your voice is still ringin' in my head
Who divided up the days into hours
The hours into minutes
How could they really be that smart?
Who divided up the minutes into seconds?
They must've had a broken heart
Must've had a broken heart
I saw you way up town
Another girl by your side
I knew by your smile she was more than just a friend
I'm gonna bury my head in the comfort so deeper
Knowin' I'll never feel your arms again
Who divided up the days into hours
The hours into minutes
How could they really be that smart?
Who divided up the minutes into seconds?
They must've had a broken heart
Must've had a broken heart
It's when love is over you're gonna learn about time
You're gonna fight and scheme
You're gonna weep and moan
You're gonna wonder why, why, why, why
It's 3 AM says the clock on the wall
Here is the dark of the night the world stands still
I'm reaching for the phone, that old number to call
Oh, but I know I can't stand to feel that chill
Who divided up the days into hours
The hours into minutes
How could they really be that smart?
Who divided up the minutes into seconds?
They must've had a broken heart
Must've had a broken heart
Who divided up the days into hours
The hours into minutes
How could they really be that smart?
Who divided up the minutes into seconds?
They must've had a broken heart
Must've had a broken heart
Who divided up the days into hours
The hours into minutes
How could they really be that smart?
Who divided up the minutes into seconds?
They must've had a broken heart
Must've had a broken heart
Oh, they must've had a broken heart
They must have, must have, must have had a broken heart
