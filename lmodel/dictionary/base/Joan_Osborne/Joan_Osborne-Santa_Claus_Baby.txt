<song artist="Joan_Osborne" title="Santa_Claus_Baby">
Santa Claus, Santa Claus
Send me, send me, send me
Santa Claus, Santa Claus
Send me, send me, send me
Just send my baby, send my baby back to me
Santa Claus, Santa Claus
Tell me where did he go
Santa Claus, Santa Claus
Tell me where did he go
I miss his kisses underneath the mistletoe
Well baby left me a year ago
But where he went I do not know
Listen Santa, got a job for you
If you don't find my baby, I don't know what I'll do
Santa Claus, Santa Claus
Send me, send me, send me
Just send my baby, send my baby back to me
Well baby left me a year ago
But where he went I do not know
Listen Santa, got a job for you
If you don't find my baby, I don't know what I'll do
Santa Claus, Santa Claus
Send me, send me, send me
Just send my baby, send my baby back to me
Just send my baby, send my baby back to me
Since he's been gone I been livin' in misery
