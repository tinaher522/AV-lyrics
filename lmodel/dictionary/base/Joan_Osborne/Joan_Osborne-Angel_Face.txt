<song artist="Joan_Osborne" title="Angel_Face">
I was struck down by your angel face
I had a father
I had a brother
I had a husband and I had a lover
I had a son he filled me with wonder
But I was struck down by your angel face
I was a woman
I was a mother
Woke in a fever from what I've been under
You made my heart beat
like God made the thunder
I was struck down by your angel face
Oh, did I tell you?
Did I bother to mention
you're keeping me worried
building up tension
Spinning out of control
Don't trust my intention since
I was struck down by your angel face
