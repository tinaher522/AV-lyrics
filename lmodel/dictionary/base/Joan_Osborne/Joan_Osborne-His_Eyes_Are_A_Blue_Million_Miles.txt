<song artist="Joan_Osborne" title="His_Eyes_Are_A_Blue_Million_Miles">
I look at him and he looks at me 
In his eyes I see the sea 
Don't see what he sees in a girl like me 
He says he loves me 
His eyes, his eyes 
His eyes are a blue million miles 
His eyes, his eyes 
His eyes are a blue million miles 
Far as I can see he loves me 
His eyes, his eyes 
His eyes are a blue million miles
