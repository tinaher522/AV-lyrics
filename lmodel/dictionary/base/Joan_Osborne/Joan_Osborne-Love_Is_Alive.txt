<song artist="Joan_Osborne" title="Love_Is_Alive">
Well I think it's time to get ready
to realize just what I have found
I have been only half of what I am
it's all clear to me now
My heart is on fire
My soul's like a wheel that's turning
My love is alive
My love is alive
There's something inside
that's making me crazy
I'll try to keep it together
But what I say may not happen the same way
now could mean forever
My heart is on fire
My soul's like a wheel that's turning
My love is alive
My love is alive
Is there a movie inside my mind
reflecting the love that you shine on me
But hold on how to that feeling
Let it go, let it grow
My heart is on fire
My soul's like a wheel that's turning
My love is alive
My love is alive
