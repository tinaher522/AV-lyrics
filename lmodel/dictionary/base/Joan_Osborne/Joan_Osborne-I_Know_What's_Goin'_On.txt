<song artist="Joan_Osborne" title="I_Know_What's_Goin'_On">
Mmm...
You would make a mistake
If you think I'm not awake
I know what's goin' on
You've been lying to me
But I don't want to set you free
I know what's goin' on
I'm the one who makes you happy
You got to know that for sure
Come on can we give our love just one more try
Make it better than it was before
Did you try to resist
Was she longing to be kissed
I know what's going on
You have changed who you are
I been watching from afar
I know what's going on
Mmm...
I know what's goin' on
Mmm...
I know what's goin' on
Does she whisper, does she sing
Does she say you're everything
I know what's goin' on
I can see it in my head
When we're lying in our bed
I know what's goin' on
I'm so angry I could murder, oohh
And I'm so lonesome in my mind
Oh, how I wish I didn't love you baby
But you got me hangin' on your line
Mmm...
Mmm...
I will wait for this to end
Cause I know you'll need a friend
When at last she breaks your heart
Cause the only way to win
Is to get you back again
Until then I'll fall apart
Mmm...
I know what's goin' on
