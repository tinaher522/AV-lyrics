<song artist="Joan_Osborne" title="Break_Up_To_Make_Up">
Tell me what's wrong - with you
Tell me why I - never seem to make you happy
Though heaven knows I try
What does it take - to please you
Tell me just how - I can satisfy you baby
You're drivin' me wild
Break up to make up
That's all we do
First you love me, then you hate me
That's a game for fools
Break up to make up
That's all we do
First you love me, then you hate me
That's a game for fools
When I come home - from workin'
You're on the phone
Talkin' 'bout how bad I treat you
Now tell me I'm wrong
You say it's me - who argues
I say it's you
We have got to get together
Or baby we're through
Break up to make up
That's all we do
First you love me, then you hate me
That's a game for fools
Break up to make up
That's all we do
First you love me, then you hate me
That's a game for fools
Break up to make up
That's all we do
First you love me, then you hate me
That's a game for fools
Break up to make up
That's all we do
First you love me, then you hate me
That's a game for fools
Break up to make up
That's all we do
First you love me, then you hate me
That's a game for fools
