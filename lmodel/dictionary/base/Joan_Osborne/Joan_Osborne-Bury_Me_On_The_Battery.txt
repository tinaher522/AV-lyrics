<song artist="Joan_Osborne" title="Bury_Me_On_The_Battery">
If I die in New York city
Bury me on the Battery
The pretty girls on Brooklyn ferry
Ask them all to weep for me
I'll be smiling brother
When they lay me down
Cause I lived my life
In New York town
Say it again
I'll be smiling brother
When they lay me down
Cause I lived my life
In New York town
And I'll be smiling brother
When they lay me down
Cause I lived my life
In New York town
I'll be smiling brother
When they lay me down
Cause I lived my life
In New York town
Because I lived my life
In New York town
