<song artist="Joan_Osborne" title="What_Do_Bad_Girls_Get?">
Well the holidays are coming
And it has got me so upset
See, I got a burning question
And nobody's answered yet
Good girls get toys for christmas
But Santa, what do bad girls get?
Do you cross me off your list?
For flirtin' and for teasin'?
Yes, I pouted and I cried
But I had a real good reason
Oh, I got a burnin' question
Nobody's answered yet
Good girls get toys for christmas
But Santa, what do bad girls get?
Nice and easy now
Alright, alright
Mmm, well you got your calculator
You're countin' up my sins
But Santa please consider
How much worse I could've bee
Oh I got a burnin' question
Tell me once, you know I won't forget
Good girls get toys for Christmas
But Santa, what do bad girls get?
