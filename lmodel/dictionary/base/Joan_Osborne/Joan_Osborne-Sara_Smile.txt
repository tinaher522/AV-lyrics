<song artist="Joan_Osborne" title="Sara_Smile">
Baby hair with a woman's eyes
I can feel you watching in the night
All alone with me and were waiting for the sunlight
When I feel cold you warm me
When I feel I cant go on you come and hold me
Its you... and me forever
Sara smile
Wont you smile a while for me, Sara
If you feel like leaving you know you can go
But why dont you stay until tomorrow?
And if you want to be free, all you have to do is say so
When you feel cold, Ill warm you
And when you feel you cant go on, Ill come and hold you
Its you... and me forever
Sara smile
Wont you smile a while for me, Sara
Sara smile
Wont you smile a while for me, Sara
