<song artist="Joan_Osborne" title="Away_In_A_Manger">
Away in a manger
No crib for His bed
The little Lord Jesus
Laid down His sweet head
The stars in the sky
Looked down where He lay
The little Lord Jesus
Asleep on the hay
The cattle are lowing
The poor Baby wakes
But little Lord Jesus
No crying He makes
I love Thee, Lord Jesus
Look down from the sky
And stay by my cradle
'Til morning is nigh
Be near me, Lord Jesus
I ask Thee to stay
Close by me forever
And love me I pray
Bless all the dear children
In Thy tender care
And take us to heaven
To live with Thee there
Take us to heaven
Take us to heaven
Take us to heaven
Take us to heaven
Take us to heaven
To live with Thee there
Oh the stars in the sky
Looked down where He lay
The little Lord Jesus
Asleep in the hay
The little Lord Jesus
Asleep in the hay
The little Lord Jesus
Asleep in the hay
