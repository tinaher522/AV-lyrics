<song artist="Joan_Osborne" title="Hurricane">
I am a genius
I am a diamond
My pretty tongue gives you a freezer burn
I think above you in three dimensions
Come in here, you can never return
Like a hurricane
In the face of the wind and the rain
Like a hurricane
When you open you open a vein
I see your headlights across my ceiling
You are a puppet of a wish I made
They never touch me, they say I'm crazy
I was born from my mother's brain, my mother's brain
Like a hurricane
In the face of the wind and the rain
Like a hurricane
When you open you open a vein
You plant a seed in my mind
I walk around and I speak your message
For myself I don't know what to say
I walk around and I speak your message
Like a hurricane
In the face of the wind and the rain
Like a hurricane
When you open you open a vein
Give me more give me more Novocain
