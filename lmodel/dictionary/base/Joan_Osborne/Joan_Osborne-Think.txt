<song artist="Joan_Osborne" title="Think">
You better think (think!)
Think about what you're trying to do to me
Think (think think)
Let your mind go. Let yourself go free 
Let's go back let's go back let's go way on back when
I didn't even know you. You couldn't 'o been too much more than 10
I ain't no psychiatrist I ain't no doctor with degrees
But it don't take too much IQ to see what you're doin' to me 
You better think (think!)
Think about what you're trying to do to me
Think (think think)
Let your mind go. Let yourself go free 
Freedom (freedom), Freedom (freedom) 
There ain't nothing you could ask I can answer what you want
But I was gonna change my mind if you keep doin' things I don't 
You better think (think!)
Think about what you're trying to do to me
Think (think think)
Let your mind go. Let yourself go free 
People walkin' 'round everyday planning games and taking scores
Tryin to make other people lose their minds well be careful you don't lose 
Yours 
You better think (think!)
Think about what you're trying to do to me
Think (think think)
Let your mind go. Let yourself go free 
You need me and I need you
Without each other there ain't nothing we can do 
Oh Freedom (freedom) Freedom (freedom) ...
There ain't nothing you could ask I can answer what you want
But I was gonna change my mind if you keep doin' things I don't 
You better think (think!)
Think about what you're trying to do to me
Think (think think)
Let your mind go. Let yourself go free 
You need me and I need you
Without each other there ain't nothing we can do 
Freedom ...
Think ...
