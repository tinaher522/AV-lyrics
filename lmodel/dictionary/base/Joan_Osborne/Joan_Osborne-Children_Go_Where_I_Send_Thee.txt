<song artist="Joan_Osborne" title="Children_Go_Where_I_Send_Thee">
Children go where I send thee
How shall I send thee?
I'm gonna send thee one by one
One for the little bitty, baby
Born, born, born in Bethlehem
Children, go where I send thee
How shall I send thee?
I'm gonna send thee two by two
Two for Paul and Silas
One for the little bitty, baby
Born, born, born in Bethlehem
Three
For the Hebrew children
Four
For the four that stood
At the door
Five
For the gospel preachers
Six for the six
That never got fixed
Seven for the seven
That never got to heaven
Eight for the eight
That stood at the gate
Nine for the nine
All dressed so fine
Ten
For the ten commandments
Eleven
For the eleven deriders
Twelve
For the twelve Apostles
