<song artist="Joan_Osborne" title="After_Jane">
I can't laugh
I can't moan
I can't leave myself alone
After Jane
After Jane
I was hers
She was mine
We were together all the time
Oh, my Jane
Oh, my Jane
Maybe it's the right thing, and maybe it's wrong
You know I lay awake and wonder all night long
Maybe it's over and maybe we're free
You know this lonely feelin' is drownin' me
Will I rise up again?
Will I ever know a friend, like my Jane?
Oh, my Jane
Maybe it's the right thing and maybe it's wrong
You know I lay awake and wonder all night long
Maybe it's over and maybe it's not
You know this lonely feelin' is all I got
Will I rise up again?
Will I ever know a friend, like my Jane?
Oh, my Jane
After Jane
After Jane
Oh, my Jane
Oh, my Jane
After Jane
