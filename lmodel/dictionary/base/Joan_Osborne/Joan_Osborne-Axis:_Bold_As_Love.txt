<song artist="Joan_Osborne" title="Axis:_Bold_As_Love">
Anger, he smiles,
towering in shiny metallic purple armour
Queen Jealousy, envy waits behind him
Her fiery green gown sneers at the grassy ground
Blue are the life-giving waters taken for granted,
They quietly understand
Once happy turquoise armies lay opposite ready,
But wonder why the fight is on
But they're bold as love, just as bold as love
Yeah, they're bold as love
Just ask the axis
My red is so confident that he flashes trophies of war,
and ribbons of euphoria
Orange is young and full of daring,
But very unsteady for the first go round
My yellow in this case is not so mellow
In fact I'm trying to say it's frigthened like me
And all these emotions of mine keep holding me from
Giving my life to a rainbow like you
I'm as bold as love, I'm as bold as love
Just as bold as love 
Just ask the axis
