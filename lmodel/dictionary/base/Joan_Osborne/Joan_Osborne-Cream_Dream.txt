<song artist="Joan_Osborne" title="Cream_Dream">
You would make a mistake
If you think I'm not awake
I know what's goin' on
You've been lying to me
But I don't want to set you free
I know what's goin' on
I'm the one who makes you happy,
You got to know that for sure
(can't we give our love just one more try
Make it better than it was before)
Did you try to resist
Was she longing to be kissed
I know what's going on
Does she whisper does she sing
Does she say you're everything
I know what's going on
I will wait for this to end
Cause I know you'll need a friend
When at last she breaks your heart
Cause the only way to win
Is to get you back again
Until then I'll fall apart
I know what's going on
(You have changed who you are
I been watching from afar)
