<song artist="Joan_Osborne" title="Cherry_Tree_Carol">
When Joseph was an old man, an old man was he
He married Virgin Mary, the Queen of Galilee
He married Virgin Mary, the Queen of Galilee
Mary and Joseph walked through an orchard green
There were berries and cherries, as thick as might be seen
There were berries and cherries, as thick as might be seen
When Mary said to Joseph, so meek and so mild
Joseph, gather me some cherries, for I am with child
Joseph, gather me some cherries, for I am with child
Then Joseph flew in anger, in anger flew he
Let the father of the baby gather cherries for thee!
Let the father of the baby gather cherries for thee!
Then up spoke baby Jesus, from in Mary's womb
Bend down the tallest tree, that my mother might have some
Bend down the tallest tree, that my mother might have some
Then bend down the tallest branch, it touched Mary's hand
Cried she, oh look thou Joseph, I have cherries by command
Oh look thou Joseph, I have cherries by command
