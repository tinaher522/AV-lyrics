<song artist="Joan_Osborne" title="Great_Day_In_December">
It was on a cold December day
When Joseph carried a baby away
To a place for the savior to be born, oh
He couldn't find no place to rest
She bore, yes she did, she bore the pain
A little child, oh Jesus, truly had to be born
I heard him say: there ain't no room at the inn
No room at the inn, there ain't no room at the inn
There ain't no room at the inn, there ain't no room at the inn
For your child (room at the inn)
To be born (room at the inn)
Ohh (room at the inn)
You know we traveled through the night
Storm and rain, oh yes it was
The little child, oh Jesus, truly had to be born
Joseph he trembled all through the night
Nobody but Joseph and his little darlin' wife
I said, there were three, three wise men comin' from afar
Bible tells me they were guided by the stars
Till they fell down to worship this holy one
I heard them say 'there ain't no room at the inn'
No room at the inn, there ain't no room at the inn
There ain't no room at the inn, there ain't no room at the inn
For your child (room at the inn)
To be born (room at the inn)
Ohh (room at the inn)
You know we traveled through the night
Storm and rain, oh yes it was
The little child, oh Jesus, truly had to be born
You know I heard them say 'there ain't no room at the inn'
No room at the inn, there ain't no room at the inn
There ain't no room at the inn, there ain't no room at the inn
For your child (room at the inn)
To be born (room at the inn)
Ohh (room at the inn)
Through the night
Storm and rain, oh yes it was
The little child, oh Jesus, truly had to be born
The little child, oh Jesus, truly had to be born
Oh little child, oh Jesus, truly had to be born
