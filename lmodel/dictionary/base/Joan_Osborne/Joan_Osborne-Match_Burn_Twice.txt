<song artist="Joan_Osborne" title="Match_Burn_Twice">
Early in the morning when I'm still in bed 
I start thinking 'bout last night 
My imagination gets the best of me 
And I can feel the match burn twice 
Baby have I told you that I love your way 
Only once will never suffice 
They say that love is always sweeter the second time around 
And I can feel the match burn twice 
Oh I take my time, time, time 
Oh I must confess 
Oh here comes the part I like the best 
So even when you're miles and miles away from me 
Baby it's no sacrifice 
They say that love is always sweeter the second time around 
And I can feel the match burn twice 
Oh I take my time, time, time 
Oh I must confess 
Oh here comes the part I like the best 
So even if you're never comin' back no more 
Baby it's no sacrifice 
They say that love is always sweeter the second time around 
And I can feel the match burn twice
