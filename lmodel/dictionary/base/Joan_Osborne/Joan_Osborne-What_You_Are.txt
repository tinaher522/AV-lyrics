<song artist="Joan_Osborne" title="What_You_Are">
All the ladies on the lake they start to dance
It's been a long time don't you wish you had the chance
What do you wish you were?
Do you wish you were the silence of the moon?
Nobody knows but maybe you will be soon
I used to think that the sidewalk was the way
Always waiting for my lucky day
Over and over, every patch of gray
One day inside me I was lucky anyway
What do you wish you were?
Do you wish you were the light of every star?
Nobody knows but maybe that's just what you are
All night, count all the singing stars
All right is where you want to know you are
What do you wish you were?
Do you wish you were the light of every star?
Nobody knows but maybe that's just what you are
Nobody knows but maybe that's just what you are
