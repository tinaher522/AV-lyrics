<song artist="Joan_Osborne" title="Holy_Waters">
On a pitch black highway lookin' for a road
Sleepin' on a stormy bed, honey, who will be your coat
Came to be my drivin' wheel, you came to be my man
Now you're rollin' like a baby boy in the backseat of a van
Holy waters, holy way
Holy waters, sweetest way
Mississippi and Missouri
Where the sun swims with the moon
Rainbows run through chapel rooms
Pourin' honey by the spoon
In came to bring you watermelon
Bring you scented wine
Now I'm burning up in hot breath
And the rivers rollin' out of time
Holy waters, holy way
Holy waters, sweetest way
I listen to a seashell out on a purple shore
I heard a song so wild and sweet it moved me to the core
So while the road is dancin' you let your love know how
Move it like the ocean and the waves from here tonight
Holy waters, holy way
Holy waters, sweetest way
Holy waters, holy way
Holy waters, sweetest way
Holy waters, holy way
Holy waters, sweetest way
Holy waters, holy way
Holy waters, sweetest way
