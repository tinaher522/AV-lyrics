<song artist="Joan_Osborne" title="Midnight_Train_To_Georgia">
L.A. proved too much for the man
So he's leavin' the life that he's come to know
He said he's goin' back to find
Ohhh what's left of his world
The world he left behind not so long ago
He's leavin'
On that midnight train to Georgia
Said he's goin' back to find
A simpler place and time
I'll be with him
On that midnight train to Georgia
I'd rather live in his world
Than live without him in mine
He kept dreamin'
Ohhh that someday he'd be a star,
But he sure found out the hard way
That dreams don't always come true
So he pawned all his hopes
And he even sold his old car
Bought a one way ticket back
To the life he used to know
Oh yes he did
Now now he's leavin'
On that midnight train to Georgia
He said he's goin' back to find
A simpler place and time
I'll be with him
On that midnight train to Georgia
Ohhh I'd rather live in his world
Than live without him in mine
All aboard on a midnight train to Georgia
I gotta be with him on a midnight train to Georgia
On a midnight train said
I gotta be with him
Ohhh I gotta be with him on a midnight train to Georgia
I gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go to a midnight train to Georgia
On a midnight train to Georgia
