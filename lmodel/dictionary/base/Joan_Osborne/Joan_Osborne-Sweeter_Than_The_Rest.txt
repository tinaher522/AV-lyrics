<song artist="Joan_Osborne" title="Sweeter_Than_The_Rest">
Flood tide below me
With the sun in my eyes
And I reach for the feeling
That the world is my prize
And I'm crossing Brooklyn ferry
With the clouds to my West
And I know why I missed it
Some are sweet, but you were sweeter
Some are sweet, but you were sweeter
Some are sweet, but you were sweeter
Some are sweet, but you were sweeter
Than the rest
Well you climb in my window
And you painted it gold
It was stone recognition
It was truth being told
And we burn down the Winter
With the fire we possess
And I wish you could know this
Some are sweet, but you were sweeter
Some are sweet, but you were sweeter
Some are sweet, but you were sweeter
Some are sweet, but you were sweeter
Than the rest
And I wish you well
And I wish you well
And I wish you well
Oh I wish you well
Oh I wish you well
And I wish you well...
Well well well
Sometimes I wonder
If it's time to go home
But this dream I've been dreaming
Will not leave me alone
I can go where I want to
And I'm doing my best
But I know what I'm losing
Some are sweet, but you were sweeter
Some are sweet, but you were sweeter
Some are sweet, but you were sweeter
Some are sweet, but you were sweeter
Than the rest
Some are sweet, but you were sweeter
Some are sweet, but you were sweeter
Some are sweet, but you were sweeter
Than the rest
Some are sweet, but you were sweeter
Some are sweet, but you were sweeter
Some are sweet, but you were sweeter
Than the rest
Some are sweet, but you were sweeter
Some are sweet, but you were sweeter
Some are sweet, but you were sweeter
Than the rest
