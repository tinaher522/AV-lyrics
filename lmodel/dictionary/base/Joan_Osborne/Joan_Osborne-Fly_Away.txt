<song artist="Joan_Osborne" title="Fly_Away">
Don't ask her how she knows, but she knows 
It's gonna be great 
Don't ask her how she knows, but she knows 
And she can't wait 
Hey hey hey to flyaway 
Number one for takeoff 
To that big drowning pool in the sky 
Number one for takeoff 
And her dress wavin' you goodbye 
Hey hey hey flyaway 
Gone up in rapture 
Gone see Your mother 
Take off your heavy head 
Gone up in rapture 
Life's better when you're dead 
Bones light as eggshells 
Look down on Main Street 
See all the people run 
Laugh if you want to 
She's goin' to the sun 
Hey hey hey flyaway
