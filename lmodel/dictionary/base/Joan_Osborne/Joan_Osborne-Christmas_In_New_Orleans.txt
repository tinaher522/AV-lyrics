<song artist="Joan_Osborne" title="Christmas_In_New_Orleans">
Magnolia trees at night
Sparkling bright
Fields of cotton look Wintery white
When it's Christmas time in New Orleans
A barefoot choir in prayer
Fills the air
Mississippi folks are gathering there
When it's Christmas time in New Orleans
You'll see a dixieland Santa Claus
Leading the band
To a good old Creole beat
And golly what a spirit
You can only hear it
Down on Basin Street
Your cares will disappear
When you hear
Hallelujah, St. Nicholas is here
When it's Christmas time in New Orleans
Oh yeah baby
You'll see a dixieland Santa Claus
Leading the band
To a good old Creole beat
And golly what a spirit
You can only hear it
Down on Basin Street
Your cares will disappear
When you hear
Hallelujah, old St. Nicholas is here
When it's Christmas time in New Orleans
When it's Christmas time in, in New Orleans
