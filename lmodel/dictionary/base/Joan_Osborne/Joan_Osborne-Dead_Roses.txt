<song artist="Joan_Osborne" title="Dead_Roses">
Do you think about the days when we were in love
When a whispered word could send us both to heaven
Now I press a kiss but I know it doesn't move you
It's time for me to let it go
Dead letters with words that are no longer true
Dead silence where your promise used to be
You don't love me anymore but I'd rather be with you
Dead roses are still beautiful to me
Well, I still hang around put money in the jukebox
Play those songs, let them ring the tears from me
Friends all shake their heads and tell me to go on home
But that's where all those memories will be
Dead letters with words that are no longer true
Dead silence where your promise used to be
You don't want me anymore but I'd rather be with you
Dead roses are still beautiful to me
Dead letters with words that are no longer true
Dead silence where your promise used to be
You don't want me anymore but I'd rather be with you
Dead roses are still beautiful to me
Dead roses are still beautiful to me
