<song artist="Joan_Osborne" title="Ladder">
Today and every day, today and every day
Today and every day, today and every day
I'm standin' here in your closet
Unbuttonin' all your clothes
I sleep in your bed tonight
But I never find you home
You're givin' me crooked answers
I'm crackin' your little code
I'm learnin' another language
So full it's about to explode
You gave me a ladder now
I surely believe I'll climb
It don't even matter now
I'm willing to take my time
I'm gonna love you anyway
Today and every day, today and every day
I'm gonna love you anyway
Today and every day, today and every day
I wanted it to be easy
I know that I'll make you tired
Some tell me you're slow and lazy
Some tell me you're so inspired
You wanted a long flirtation
Your plane doesn't ever land
Some things I don't want to look at
I don't want to understand
You gave me a ladder now
I surely believe I'll climb
It don't even matter now
I'm willing to take my time
I'm gonna love you anyway
Today and every day, today and every day
I'm gonna love you anyway
Today and every day, today and every day
Today and every day...
