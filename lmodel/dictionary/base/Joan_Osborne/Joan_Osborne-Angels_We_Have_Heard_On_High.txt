<song artist="Joan_Osborne" title="Angels_We_Have_Heard_On_High">
Angels we have heard on high
Sweetly singing ore the plains
And the mountains in reply
Echoing their joyous strains 
Gloria in excelsis Deo
Gloria in excelsis Deo 
Come to Bethlehem and see
Christ whose birth the angels sing
Come adore on bended knee
Christ the Lord the newborn King 
Gloria in excelsis Deo
Gloria in excelsis Deo 
See him in a manger laid
Whom the choirs of angels praise
Mary, Joseph, lend your aid
While our hearts in love we raise 
Gloria in excelsis Deo
Gloria, in excelsis Deo
Gloria in excelsis Deo
