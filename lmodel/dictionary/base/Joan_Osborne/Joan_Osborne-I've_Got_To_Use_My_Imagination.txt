<song artist="Joan_Osborne" title="I've_Got_To_Use_My_Imagination">
I've really got to use my imagination
To think of good reasons
To keep on keepin' on
Got to make the best of a bad situation
Ever since that day
I woke up and found
That you were gone
Darkness all around me
Blackin’ out the sun
Old friends call me
But I just don't feel like talkin’ to anyone
Emptiness has found me
And it just won't let me go
I go right on livin'
But why I just don't know
Staring down reality
Don't do me no good
'Cause our misunderstanding
Is too well understood
Such a sad, sad season
When a good love dies.
Not a day goes by
When I don’t realize
I've really got to use my imagination
To think of good reasons
To keep on keepin' on
I got to make the best of a bad situation
Ever since that day
I woke up and found
That you were gone
