<song artist="Joan_Osborne" title="Safety_In_Numbers">
There is safety in numbers
And people and thins and in big wads of money 
And great big platinum rings
And no one will ever get near me again
There is safety in numbers
In numbers my friend
There are people who watch you in your windows at night
And they follow your movements in the cold fluorescent light
They wait for their moment, they'll get you in the end
There is safety in numbers, in numbers my friend
I was just like you before
You want somebody to love
Since that day I learned the score
I know how to rise above
There is shelter in power
And promises of pain and in lovers and lawyers
And dogs pulling at the chain
And no one will ever get near me again
There is safety in numbers,
In numbers my friend
You will find me well protected
When you come around today
So remember what
I told you and continue on your way
Cause no one will ever
Get near me again
There is safety in numbers, in numbers my friend
