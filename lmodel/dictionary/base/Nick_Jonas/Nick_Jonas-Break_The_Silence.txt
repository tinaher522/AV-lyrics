<song artist="Nick_Jonas" title="Break_The_Silence">
I don't know 
What went wrong
We lost the key to our song, yeah
But we had it made
For so long
There were nights by your side I would cry 'cause the flame was gone, yeah
No words, it hurts
Way too much to speak, oh oh
It's time for me to break the silence
'Cause we been screaming so loud on the inside
It's time for me to break the silence
I wanna hold you so bad, but it ain't right
'Cause I can feel the love is dying
But if you lay my body down
And kiss my soul while you're still around
We might not miss this chance
To break the silence
There's a melody, in my mind
As the memories of us fly away
And I can see, that you need to find
A new way to replace all the white noise in your life, yeah
It's time for me to break the silence
'Cause we been screaming so loud on the inside
It's time for me to break the silence
I wanna hold you so bad, but it ain't right
'Cause I can feel the love is dying
But if you lay my body down
And kiss my soul while you're still around
We might not miss this chance
To break the silence
If you could only hear my heart
We will make it through
And we wouldn't fall apart
It's time for me
 It's time for me
It's time for me to break the silence
'Cause we been screaming so loud on the inside
It's time for me to break the silence
I wanna hold you so bad, but it ain't right
'Cause I can feel the love is dying
But if you lay my body down
And kiss my soul while you're still around
We might not miss this chance
It's time for me to break the silence
'Cause we been screaming so loud on the inside
It's time for me to break the silence
I wanna hold you so bad, but it ain't right
'Cause I can feel the love is dying
But if you lay my body down
And kiss my soul while you're still around
We might not miss this chance
To break the silence
