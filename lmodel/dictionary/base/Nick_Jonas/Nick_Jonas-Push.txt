<song artist="Nick_Jonas" title="Push">
Hold me down under the water
You know well that I can't swim
I'm not trying to be a martyr
Know that I won't let you in
Safe in warm inside myself
But you need more than someone else
You need space, you need time
You take yours and I'll take mine
Come closer
So I can be the one to push
It's not me, it's just you
Doesn't leave shit when it falls through
Come closer
So I can be the one to push you
The one to push
Hold me tight enough to kill me
Bite my tongue so I can't speak
Clip my wings so I can't fly
Bury me deep, but I won't die 
Was it worth it?
Was it worth it?
 You need space, you need time
You take yours and I'll take mine
Come closer
So I can be the one to push
It's not me, it's just you
Doesn't leave shit when it falls through
Come closer
So I can be the one to push you (push you)
The one to push you (push you)
Guess I needed you enough not to notice
Guess I wanted you enough to lie
You wear so many faces I should've noticed
But that sure was a beautiful disguise
You need space, you need time
You take yours and I'll take mine
Come closer
So I can be the one to push
It's not me, it's just you
Doesn't leave shit when it falls through
Come closer
So I can be the one to push you (push you)
The one to push you (push you)
What I gave, in the past
We made love and we're in tact
Let me hold you
So you can be the one to push back
