Mmmmhmmmmmm
Hmmmmmmmmm
I can see it in your eyes
Tell me what's on your mind
Don't keep it all inside
I am here for you
(I am here for you)
Did somebody bring you down
Turn your smile into a frown
I'll help you work it out
When the answer's hard to find
I will give you peace of mind
When you need a friend to call
I'll be right there beside you
To shelter you and guide you
I'll miss you candle light
When your tear drops start to fall
I will be there to dry them
Before you can cry them
On the darkest night
I will be the light
I will be the light
Do do do do do do
You can share your secrets here
There's no need to be afraid
My love will never change
It's unconditional
(It's unconditional)
Knock the door to your heart
Knocked down and torn apart
I'll help you make a start
And build it up again
Help you shine a light within
When you need a friend to call
(When you need a friend)
I'll be right there beside you
To shelter you and guide you
I'll miss you candle light
(I'll miss you candle light)
When your tear drops start to fall
(I will dry them)
I will be there to dry them
Before you can cry them
On the darkest night
I will be the light
I will be the light
Do do do do do do
Everybody's searching for somebody to believe in
Everybody needs someone to care
A shoulder you can cry on
A love you can rely on
Reach out and trust me if you can
Just take my hand
When you need a friend to call
(Anytime you need a friend)
I'll be right there beside you
To shelter you and guide you
I'll miss you candle light
(And you can rely on me)
When your tear drops start to fall
I will be there to dry them
Before you can cry them
On the darkest night
I will be the light
I will be the light
Do do do do do do
No wind
No rain
No storm is ever going to stand in my way
No load is too great
Hold on
I'll be there to carry the weight
No wind
No rain
No storm is ever going to stand in my way
No load is too great
Hold on
I'll be there to carry the weight
