<song artist="Nick_Jonas" title="Champagne_Problems">
How many times have we been here before?
How many pieces have to break?
So many reasons not to celebrate
But I hate to see you cry so let's drink before goodbye
I got a bottle I've been saving up
Thought that we'd drink it all night, hey
We were the opposite of breaking up
Can't believe I'm losing you
We just opened up too soon
We got champagne problems
Only one way to solve 'em
Raising our glass cause it's our loss
With these champagne problems
Just keep on, keep on drinking
Keep on, keep on drinking
Keep on, keep on...
How did our clothes end up on the floor?
Didn't we just break each other's hearts?
Didn't you have one foot out the door?
Better to fall in love than lose, wish I didn't have to choose
We got champagne problems
Only one way to solve 'em
Raising our glass cause it's our loss
With these champagne problems
Just keep on, keep on drinking
Keep on, keep on drinking
Keep on, keep on...
We got champagne problems
Oh my God, the room is spinning from the Perignon
And you're still with me but you're very gone
It feels so right but we both know it's wrong
When you got, when you got, when you got...
We got champagne problems
Only one way to solve 'em
Raising our glass cause it's our loss
With these champagne problems
Just keep on, keep on drinking
Keep on, keep on drinking
Keep on, keep on...
Champagne problems
Only one way to solve 'em
Raising our glass cause it's our loss
With these champagne problems
Just keep on, keep on drinking
Keep on, keep on drinking
Keep on, keep on...
We got champagne problems...
