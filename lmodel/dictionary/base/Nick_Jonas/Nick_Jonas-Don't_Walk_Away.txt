<song artist="Nick_Jonas" title="Don't_Walk_Away">
Feeling like you lost your way
See that you've had better days
You don't know why
Everything seems way too hard
Start to wonder who you are and why you try
I understand the way you feel
And I can help you keep it real
And I can help you see...
Everything your missing here
Help you take away your fear and set you free
Find a way back to your heart
Thats a start
Thats where the answers are
Don't walk away from what you once believed
Just call my name and and I will help you see..
Keep your head up, keep your game on
Don't turn your back on your faith
Don't walk away
I know that life can be so hard
People then nay tear you apart and turn you round
I will be here for you always
All you gotta do is call my name out loud
Find a way back to your heart
Thats a start
Thats where the answers are
Don't walk away from what you once believed
Just call my name and and I will help you see..
Keep your head up, keep your game on
Don't turn your back on your faith
Don't walk away
Don't you walk away
You will find a way
Don't you walk away
I know that life will test your faith
Don't you walk away
I'll help you find your way
Don't walk away
Don't you walk away
You can call my name
I can help you, help you figure it out
Don't you walk away
You can call my name
I can help you, help you turn it around
In your heart is where the answers are
Don't turn your back on your faith
Don't walk away from what you once believed
Just call my name and and I will help you see..
Keep your head up, keep your game on
Don't turn your back on your faith
Don't walk away
Don't walk away from what you once believed
Don't you walk away
Don't walk away from what you once believed
Don't you walk away
Don't walk away from what you once believed
Don't you walk away
