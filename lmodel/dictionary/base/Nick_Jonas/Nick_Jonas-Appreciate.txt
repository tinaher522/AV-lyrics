<song artist="Nick_Jonas" title="Appreciate">
There's a man dying on the side of the road, 
Won't make it home tonight. 
He was driving fast on his cell phone, 
That's how he lived his life. 
While he was hangin' by a thread 
These were the final words he said 
My girl turns sweet sixteen today, 
She's beautiful, so beautiful. 
It might get rough sometimes 
But I hope she keeps her faith (Hope she keeps her faith) 
I wish I'd grabbed the chance to say to her 
Life is too short so take that time and Appreciate 
There's a woman crying on the kitchen floor, 
She got a call tonight 
Now she's trembling outside her daughter's door 
Walks in and holds her tight 
Wondering how and where to start, 
Is there a way to shield her heart? 
My girl turns sweet sixteen today, 
She's beautiful, so beautiful 
It might get rough sometimes 
But I hope she keeps her faith (Hope she keeps her faith) 
I wish I'd grabbed the chance to say to her 
Life is too short so take that time and Appreciate 
Any but a loving way 
Get hurt along the way 
Don't be afraid to open up 
And use the time you have before it fades 
Show your love today 
My girl turns sweet sixteen today, 
She's beautiful, so beautiful. 
It might get rough sometimes 
But I hope she keeps her faith.(hope she keeps her faith) 
I wish I'd grabbed the chance to say to her 
Life is too short so take that time and Appreciate. 
Life is too short so take that time and Appreciate.
