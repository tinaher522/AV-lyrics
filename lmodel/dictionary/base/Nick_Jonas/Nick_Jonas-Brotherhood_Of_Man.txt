[FINCH:]
 Now wait a minute Wally, before you make any hasty decisions
 Deep down under our skin there is flesh and blood
 We're all brothers
 Now you may join the Elks, my friend
 And I may join the Shriners
 And other men may carry cards
 As members of the Diners
 Still others wear a golden key
 Or small Greek letter pin
 But I have learned there's one great club
 That all of us are in
 There is a Brotherhood of Man
 A Benevolent Brotherhood of Man
 A noble tie that binds
 All human hearts and minds
 Into one Brotherhood of Man
 Your lifelong membership is free
 Keep a-givin' each brother all you can
 Oh aren't you proud to be in that fraternity
 The great big Brotherhood of Man?
 Now you see Wally
 I want you to remember that
 Before you consider firing Mr. Bigley
 You see, I know what's on your mind
 You'd like to clear the whole crowd from top to bottom
 That's the obvious move
 But stop and think
 One man may seem incompetent
 Another not make sense
 While others look like quite a waste
 Of company expense
 They need a brother's leadership
 So please don't do them in
 Remember mediocrity
 Is not a mortal sin
 They're in the Brotherhood of Man
 Dedicated to giving all we can
 Oh, aren't you proud to be in that fraternity
 The great big Brotherhood of Man?
[Instrumental]
 No kidding! Is there really a Brotherhood of Man?
 (Yes you're a Brother, you are a Brother)
 A benevolent Brotherhood of Man
 (Oh yes, oh yes!)
 A noble tie that binds
 All human hearts and minds
 Into one Brotherhood of Man
 (Oh yes!)
 Your lifelong membership is free
 Keep a-givin' each brother all you can
 Oh aren't you proud to be in that fraternity
 The great big Brotherhood of Man?
 Oh, that noble feeling,
 Feels like bells are pealing,
 Down with double-dealing,
 Oh Brother! You, you got me
 Me, I got you, you!
 Oh, that noble feeling
 Feels like bells are pealing
 Down with double-dealing
 Oh Brother! You, you got me
 Me, I got you, you!
 Oh, that noble feeling
 Feels like bells are pealing
 Down with double-dealing
 Oh Brother! You, you got me
 Me, I got you, you!
 Your lifelong membership is free
 Keep agivin' each brother all you can
 Oh aren't you proud to be in that fraternity,
 The great big Brotherhood of Man, man, man?
