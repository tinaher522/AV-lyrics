<song artist="Nick_Jonas" title="When_You_Look_Me_In_The_Eyes">
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah
If the heart is always searching
Can you ever find a home?
I've been looking for that someone
I never make it on my own
Dreams can't take
The place of loving you
There's gotta be a million reasons
Why it's true
When you look me in the eyes
And tell me that you love me
Everything's alright
When you're right here by my side
When you look me in the eyes
I catch a glimpse of heaven
I find my paradise
When you look me in the eyes
How long will I be waiting
To be with you again?
I'm gonna tell you that I love you
In the best way that I can
I can't take a day without you here
You're the light that make my darkness disappear
When you look me in the eyes
And tell me that you love me
Everything's alright
When you're right here by my side
When you look me in the eyes
I catch a glimpse of heaven
I find my paradise
When you look me in the eyes
Movin' on, I start to realize
I can reach my tomorrow
I can hold my head up high
And it's all because you're by my side
When you look me in the eyes
And tell me that you love me
Everything's alright
When you're right here by my side
When I hold you in my arms
I know that it's forever
I just got to let you know
I never wanna let you go
'Cause when you look me in the eyes
And tell me that you love me
Everything's alright
When you're right here by my side
When you look me in the eyes
I catch a glimpse of heaven
Oh, I find my paradise
When you look me in the eyes, oh, yeah, ah
