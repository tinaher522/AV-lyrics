<song artist="Nick_Jonas" title="Santa_Barbara">
I wish that I could hold my tongue
'Cause even when I'm right I'm wrong
I wish that I could pull this scab
Bleed you out
And there's no one
No one, like you
My love has got a bitter taste
I wish that I was in that place
But New York City
Is so far from Santa Barbara, Barbara
And there's no one
No one, like you
Ooooooh
Ooooooh
Ooooooh, Oooh 
 
Ooooooh
Ooooooh
Ooooooh, Oooh
The summer days are so long
It's hard to hide in a fight
So afraid of what you'll see
On the other side of the line, the line
And there's no one
No one, like you
I guess I used to love this place
A feeling and I know it's fake
Why is we all sitting
So far, so far from Santa Barbara, Barbara
And there's no one
No one, like you
Ooooooh
Ooooooh
Ooooooh, Oooh 
 
Ooooooh
Ooooooh
Ooooooh, Oooh
