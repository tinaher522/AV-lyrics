<song artist="Nick_Jonas" title="Please_Be_Mine">
They come and go
But they don't know
That you are my beautiful
I try to come
Closer with you
But they all say
We won't make it through
But I'll be there forever
You will see that it's better
All our hopes and our dreams will come true
I will not disappoint you
I will be right there for you
Til the end, the end of time
Please be mine
Ohhhhh
I'm in and out
Of love with you
Trying to find if it's really true
Na na na na
How can I prove my love
If they all think I'm not good enough
But I'll be there forever
You will see that it's better
All our hopes and our dreams will come true
I will not disappoint you
I will be right there for you
Til the end, the end of time
Please be mine
Yeah, oohhhhhhhh
Can't stop the rain from falling
Can't stop my heart from calling you
It's calling you 
Can't stop the rain from falling
Can't stop my heart from calling you
It's calling you 
Can't stop the rain from falling
Can't stop my heart from calling you
It's calling you 
But I'll be there forever
You will see that it's better
All our hopes and our dreams will come true
I will not disappoint you
I will be right there for you
Til the end, the end of time
Please be mine
Ohhhhh ohhhhh
Ohhhh ohhhhh
Can't stop the rain from falling
Can't stop my heart from calling you
It's calling you 
Can't stop the rain from falling
Can't stop my heart from calling you
It's calling you 
Can't stop the rain from falling
Can't stop my heart from calling you
It's calling you
