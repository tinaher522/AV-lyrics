<song artist="Nick_Jonas" title="Higher_Love">
Think about it
There must be higher love
Down in the heart
Or hidden in the stars above
Without it
Life is wasted time
Look inside your heart
I'll look inside mine
Things look so bad everywhere
In this whole world, what is fair
We walk blind and we try to see
Falling behind, what could be
Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love, ohhh
Bring me a higher love
Where's that higher love I keep thinking of
Worlds are turning
And we're just hanging on
Facing our fear
Standing out there alone
A yearning
And it's real to me
Must be someone who's routing for me
Things look so bad everywhere
In this whole world, what is fair
We walk blind and we try to see
Falling behind, what could be
Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love, ohhh
Bring me a higher love
I could rise above on a higher love
I will wait for it
I am not too late for it
Until then, I'll sing my song
To cheer the night along
Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love, ohhh
Bring me a higher love
Where's that higher love I keep thinking of
Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love, ohhh
Bring me a higher love
Where's that higher love I keep thinking of
Oh
Bring me a higher love
(Bring me a higher love)
Bring me a higher love, ohhh
(Woo!)
Bring me a higher love
(Bring me a higher love)
Bring me a higher love, ohhh
Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love, ohhh
Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love, ohhh
