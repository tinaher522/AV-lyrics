<song artist="Nick_Jonas" title="Touch">
Trust me, I'll be so good for you baby
Love me, hate me ain't the way we'll got crazy
Go crazy
In the bad way
'Cause anyone can - you baby
But that ain't all I'm into
I wanna get inside your brain
Every part of you
I go from touching with both hands
To touching you with no hands
Touching you
It's my favorite way of touching you
No words
Spoken
I still speak your language, I swear I do
There's a story in between those pages, those pages
That I wanna share with you
'Cause anyone can - you baby
But that ain't what I'm into
I wanna get inside your brain
Every part of you
I go from touching with both hands
To touching you with no hands
Touching you
It's my favorite way of touching you
I go from touching with both hands
To touching you with no hands
Touching you
It's my favorite way of touching you
'Cause can - you baby
But that all I'm into, no
I wanna get inside your brain
And every part of you
I go from touching with both hands
To touching you with no hands
Touching you
It's my favorite way of touching you
