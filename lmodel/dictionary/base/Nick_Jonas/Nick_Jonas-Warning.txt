<song artist="Nick_Jonas" title="Warning">
I keep tryna escape
From this cage that I live in
This prison in my head
Oh I own many mistakes
From all of the things I never did
I kept in my defense
Now I'm running for the fences on my own
And I can see the warning
Yeah I can see the warning
Warning
It's brighter than the morning
Morning
Keeps tryna turn me right round
And it's all I ever wanted
It's all I ever wanted
Wanted
I'm breaking the warning
Down, down
I got something inside
Keeps burning my body till it's sore
Keeps wanting more and more
All night
I'm gonna find
I'm gonna find what I had lost
Unlearn what I was taught
Now I'm running for the fences on my own
And I can see the warning
Yeah I can see the warning
Warning
It's brighter than the morning
Morning
Keeps tryna turn me right round
And it's all I ever wanted
It's all I ever wanted
Wanted
I'm breaking the warning
Down, down
I'm breaking the warning
I'm breaking the warning
Now I'm running for the fences on my own
And I can see the warning
Yeah I can see the warning
Warning
It's brighter than the morning
Morning
Keeps tryna turn me right round
And it's all I ever wanted
It's all I ever wanted
Wanted
I'm breaking the warning
Down, down
I'm breaking the warning
I'm breaking the warning
I'm breaking the warning, yeah
I'm breaking the warning down, down
Breaking the warning down
