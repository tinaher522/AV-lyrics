<song artist="Nick_Jonas" title="Testify">
I'm on one
I can't deny it not this time 
No, I'm on one
Just the thought of touching her
I come undone
Every time I'm with her it's brand new
So brand new
She's got something
Keeps me coming
I've tried running
But ain't no running from the truth
Tell myself to just be cool
I can't help it
I know what she wanna do
Anytime that you hit me up
Anytime that you want this love
Say the word and you know I'll come through, yeah
'Cause the way it feels ain't right
Messed around and it changed my life
Now I can't walk away, it's too good
Make me wanna testify
That love's too good
Make me wanna testify
That's love's too good baby
Hands up high
Got me where she want me with my hands up high
Every time I mean it, wish I could rewind
Don't nobody do me like she do
It's all brand new
She's got something
Keeps me coming
I've tried running
But ain't no running from the truth
Tell myself to just be cool
I can't help it
I know what she wanna do
Anytime that you hit me up
Anytime that you want this love
Say the word and you know I'll come through, yeah
'Cause the way it feels ain't right
Messed around and it changed my life
Now I can't walk away, it's too good
Make me wanna testify
That love's too good
Make me wanna testify
That's love's too good baby
Take me to a higher place
Yeah I can never walk away
Oh no, oh no
Take me on a ride you know 
It kills me everytime that it's over
You make me wanna testify
Anytime that you hit me up
Anytime that you want this love
Say the word and you know I'll come through, yeah
'Cause the way it feels ain't right
Messed around and it changed my life
Now I can't walk away, it's too good
Make me wanna testify
That love's too good
Make me wanna testify
That love's too good
Make me wanna testify
That's love's too good baby
