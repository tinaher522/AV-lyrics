<song artist="Nick_Jonas" title="Chainsaw">
I'll take a chainsaw to the sofa
Where I held your body close for so long, so long
Walk in the house, lights are off
In the closet by the door, there's your coat
I wasn't thinking of you before
Too many rooms in this house, so I keep going out
What the hell is that about?
We gotta find a way to be okay
And maybe I'll just take a chainsaw to the sofa
Where I held your body close for so long, so long
I'm gonna break the fucking china
'Cause it's just one more reminder you're gone, you're gone
When I get home, TV on
Drink in my glass, better make it strong
Some nights wanna fill this space
A tight dress and a pretty face
Keep finding things that you left on purpose
Did you plan that your timing's perfect?
Gotta find a way to be okay
Maybe I'll just take a chainsaw to the sofa
Where I held your body close for so long, so long
I'm gonna break the fucking china
'Cause it's just one more reminder you're gone, you're gone
We were building brick by brick
Now it's just a quicksand home, yeah
So I'll take a chainsaw to the sofa
Where I held your body close for so long, so long
I could put a sign in the lawn
But it'd mean that I would wanna let you go
And I don't wanna let you go
I could put a sign in the lawn
But it'd mean that I would wanna let you go
And I don't wanna let you go
I'll take a chainsaw to the sofa
Where I held your body close for so long, so long
I'll burn everything that binds us
Take a lighter to the mattress and run
We were building brick by brick
Now it's just a quicksand home, yeah
So I'll take a chainsaw to the sofa
Where I held your body close for so long, so long
Yeah, so long
