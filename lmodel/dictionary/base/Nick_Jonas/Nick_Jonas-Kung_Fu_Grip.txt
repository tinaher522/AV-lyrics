<song artist="Nick_Jonas" title="Kung_Fu_Grip">
She's got a smile.
That i die for.
Everyone knows, that i'm
A prisoner of war, for her.
Yeah.
Sometimes I wished.
I had a kung fu grip.
Never let her slip,
Away she'd be my girl.
Really wish she knew.
What i feel is true.
She'd be my darlin,
I would be her hero too.
Im so in love
With her.
Dont care who knows
That im
Ready to fight, ready to go.
Just like a G.I. Joe
Sometimes i wished.
I had a kung fu grip.
Never let her slip,
Away. She'd be my girl.
I Really wish she knew.
What i feel is true.
She'd be my darlin.
I would be her hero too.
Sometimes I wished.
I had a kung fu grip.
Never let her slip,
Away she'd be my girl.
She'd be my darlin
I would be her hero too
