<song artist="Nick_Jonas" title="Rosemary">
[FINCH:]
 Suddenly there is music
 In the sound of your name
 Rosemary, Rosemary
 Was the melody locked inside me
 'Till at last out it came
 Rosemary, Rosemary
 Just imagine if we kissed
 What a crescendo
 Not to be missed
 As for the rest of my life-time program
 Give me more of the same
 Rosemary, Rosemary
 There is wonderful music in the very sound
 Of your name
[ROSEMARY:]
 Ponty! I heard from [?] at the party. Where is she?
[FINCH:]
 Rosemary, the most wonderful thing has happened.
[ROSEMARY:]
 What are you talking about?
[FINCH:]
 Can't you hear it? Can't you hear it?
 Suddenly there is music
 In the sound of your name.
[ROSEMARY:]
 I can't hear a thing.
[FINCH:]
 Rosemary, just listen!
 It's all around me like a beautiful pink sky
[ROSEMARY:]
 Now, look here J. Pierpont Finch, have you lost your mind?
[FINCH:]
 Rosemary, darling, will you marry J. Pierpont Finch?
[ROSEMARY:]
 Now I hear it! I hear it! I hear it!
 Suddenly there is music
 In the sound of your name.
 J. Pierpont!
[FINCH:]
 Rosemary, just imagine
 If we kissed, what a crescendo.
[Instrumental]
[BOTH:]
 Not to be missed
[FINCH:]
 As for the
 Rest of my life-time program
 Give me more of the same
[FINCH/ROSEMARY:]
 Rosemary, Rosemary / J. Pierpont, J. Pierpont
 Rosemary / J. Pierpont
 There is wonderful music
 In the very sound of your name
