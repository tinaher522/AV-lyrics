<song artist="Nick_Jonas" title="Under_You">
Cigarrette 
That I never got a chance to hit, a chance to hit
But in my mind
Baby I can taste your lips, taste your lips
 
I was so foolish
On some stupid shit
Should've never let you out
Knowing that you've left
Messes with my head
Shawdows of your heart came out
So I'll never get over
Never get over, not getting under you
Getting under you
No I'll never get over
Never get over, not getting under you
Getting under you
Poured the glass
But I never got to take a sip, take a sip
I've been around the world
But baby your my only fix, my only fix
I was so foolish
On some stupid shit
Should've never let you out
Knowing that you've left
Messes with my head
Shawdows of your heart came out
So I'll never get over
Never get over, not getting under you
Getting under you
No I'll never get over
Never get over, not getting under you
Getting under you
Ain't no way to take it back
I've become a heart attack
Every where I see your face
And it kills me everyday
So I'll never get over
Never get over, not getting under you
Getting under you
No I'll never get over
Never get over, not getting under you
Getting under you
