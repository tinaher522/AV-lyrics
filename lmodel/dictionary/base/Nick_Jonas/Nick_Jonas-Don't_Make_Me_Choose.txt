<song artist="Nick_Jonas" title="Don't_Make_Me_Choose">
Don't make me choose
Between the left hand and my right
Don't make me choose
Between the love and my life
Either way I lose
And that just ain't right
Don't make me
If you really love me
You would never judge me
Never do that to you
Don't make me
Whenever I can, I'll be there
You got a man who knows exactly what you need
And I gotta plan
Don't be scared
I know, I know right now it's hard to see
Trust me, I can compartmentalize
Don't wanna throw this violence, I'm in for the ride
Don't make me choose
Between the left hand and my right
Don't make me choose
Between the love and my life
Either way I lose
And that just ain't right
Don't make me
If you really love me
You would never judge me
Never do that to you
Don't make me
If you wanna talk
I'll listen
I'll be here on the line until you fall asleep
Give me a time
Give me permission
To make it work
To put your mind at ease
I need you to trust me, I can compartmentalize
Don't wanna throw this violence, I'm in for the ride
Don't make me choose
Between the left hand and my right
Don't make me choose
Between the love and my life
Either way I lose
And that just ain't right
Don't make me
If you really love me
You would never judge me
Never do that to you
Don't make me
Choose 'cause I lose
Everytime you
Push at me like this
But I found a way to show you
These two worlds can more than coexist
Don't make me choose
Between the left hand and my right
Don't make me choose
Between the love and my life
Either way I lose
And that just ain't right
Don't make me
If you really love me
You would never judge me
Never do that to you
Don't make me
If you really love me 
You would never judge me
Never do that to you
Don't make me
