<song artist="Nick_Jonas" title="Comfortable">
My faith in you
Is very comfortable for me
My faith in you baby
Is very comfortable for me
Never trust a door, till it's open
Never trust a heart, till it's broken
I know you're the one who can wait the most, the most
Iverson was right, it's only practice
I don't need a mic, 'cause the fact is 
I'm living my life, it's hot then cold
So who you catering to?
Who you fuckin with when there ain't nobody fuckin with you?
I told you I knew you before you even knew that you were you
Yeah I know you better than that, I know you better
'Cause my faith in you 
Is very comfortable for me
My faith in you 
Is very comfortable for me
I'm blazing through
Until you're comfortable with me
My faith in you
Is very comfortable for me
Never met a beauty queen I didn't like
It doesn't mean it's alright and he got a wife
I'm trying hard to take my time
'Cause these tens got friends
And I'm just tryna kick with the girl in the back
Who doesn't give a damn if I'm Jay from Brooklyn or just in the band
It's all the same, it's all the same in her eyes
But who you catering to?
Who you fuckin with when there ain't nobody fuckin with you?
I told you I knew you before you even knew that you were you
Yeah I know you better than that, I know you better
'Cause my faith in you 
Is very comfortable for me
My faith in you 
Is very comfortable for me
I'm blazing through
Until you're comfortable with me
My faith in you
Is very comfortable for me
'Cause my faith in you 
Is very comfortable for me
My faith in you 
Is very comfortable for me
I'm blazing through
Until you're comfortable with me
My faith in you
Is very comfortable for me
