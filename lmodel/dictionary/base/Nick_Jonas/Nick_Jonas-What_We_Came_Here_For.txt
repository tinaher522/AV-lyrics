<song artist="Nick_Jonas" title="What_We_Came_Here_For">
They say that life is a two-way street
When you're not sure.
You gotta trust your feet
To know the right way.
You can keep on movin' with your head down
Or you can stop and take a look around.
And that's the choice I've made.
It's for that movie inside your head.
Making memories we can't forget.
And when you can't forget
You're gonna know in your soul
This is what we came here for
So live it loud
Here and now
This moment, it won't be ignored
So why not open up that door?
It's what we came here for.
For every song we let play outside
The melodies began to write
Every time we sing
Friends we've made, fun we've had
Memories gonna make me laugh
It's a beautiful thing
So beautiful
I want to say it around the world
(All around the world)
'Cause everybody should feel this good.
'Cause when you feel this good
You're gonna know in your soul
This is what we came here for
So live it loud
Here and now
This moment, it won't be ignored
So why not open up that door?
It's what we came here for
No
The fun's just getting started
Just celebrating where we are
And loving who we are
You're gonna know in your soul
This is what we came here for
So live it loud
Here and now
This moment, it won't be ignored
You're gonna know in your soul
This is what we came here for
So live it loud (live it loud)
Here and now
This moment it won't be ignored
(It won't be ignored)
So why not open up that door (open up that door)
So come on open up that door
It's what we came here (oh yeah)
(Came here for)
That's what we came here
Came here for
