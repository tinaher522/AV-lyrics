Pretty mind, silk thoughts
Start a fire when you turn the lights off
Oh my, my God
The way he made you he did a fine job
I know you been hoping I give in
But I ain't feeling that feeling, no
Babe you right, maybe I'm tripping
The one thing I love more than being with you
And that's late nights, doing what I wanna do
I got sleep eyes; I woke up like this
Feel like...
Aw shit, throw some bacon on it
One thing I love more than being with you
And that's no ties, no drama in my life
Yeah I, I woke up like this
Feel like...
Aw shit, throw some bacon on it
One thing I love more than being with you-ou-ou-ou
Yeah, you-ou-ou-ou
Yeah, you-ou-ou
Sizzling, white hot
Give me that sugar with the sweet talk
You're perfect, but I'm not
So how do we end up in the worst spot?
I know you been hoping I give in
But I ain't feeling that feeling, no
Babe you right, maybe I'm tripping
The one thing I love more than being with you
And that's late nights, doing what I wanna do
I got sleep eyes; I woke up like this
Feel like...
Aw shit, throw some bacon on it
One thing I love more than being with you
And that's no ties, no drama in my life
Yeah I, I woke up like this
Feel like...
Aw shit, throw some bacon on it
One thing I love more than being with you-ou-ou-ou
Yeah, you-ou-ou-ou
Yeah
Dolla $ign, Dolla $ign
Girl every time we get together it's a movie
You on top, got me feeling on your booty
Know you ready when there's other girls around
Won't admit it, but you're acting so different now
And it's hard to just let go like that
When your man with the party, you go way back
And the love's what keeps you coming back
And I'm loving with a bad bitch down my back
The one thing I love more than being with you
And that's late nights, doing what I wanna do
I got sleep eyes; I woke up like this
Feel like...
Aw shit, throw some bacon on it
One thing I love more than being with you
And that's no ties, no drama in my life
Yeah I, I woke up like this
Feel like...
Aw shit, throw some bacon on it
One thing I love more than being with you-ou-ou-ou
Yeah, you-ou-ou-ou
