<song artist="Nick_Jonas" title="Haven't_Met_You_Yet">
I'm not surprised, not everything lasts
I've broken my heart so many times, that I stopped keeping track
Talk myself in, I talk myself out
I get all worked up, then I let myself down
I tried so very hard not to lose it
I came up with a million excuses
I thought, I thought of every possibility
And I know someday that it'll all turn out
And you'll make me work, so we can work to work it out
And I promise you, kid, that I'll give so much more than I get
I just haven't met you yet
I might have to wait, I'll never give up
I guess it's half timing, and the other half's luck
Wherever you are, whenever it's right
You'll come out of nowhere and in my life
And I know that we can be so amazing
And, baby, your love is gonna change me
And now I can see every possibility
And I know someday that it'll all turn out
And you'll make me work, so we can work to work it out
And I promise you, kid, that I'll give so much more than I get
I just haven't met you yet
They say all's fair
In love and war
But I won't need to fight it
We'll get it right and we'll be united
Oh, you know it'll all turn out
And you'll make me work so we can work to work it out
And I promise you kid that I'll give so much more than I get
I just haven't met you yet.
