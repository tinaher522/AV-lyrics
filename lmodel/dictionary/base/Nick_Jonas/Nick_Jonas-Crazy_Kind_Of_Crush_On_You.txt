Woo! 
C'mon! 
You ready? 
Here we go! 
First day at school 
I was trying to play it cool 
Chillin' with my friends trying to pretend
That I didn't notice you 
Three rows down, second to the left
Your big round eyes and your brand new dress 
Right then I saw my dream come true (Yeah) 
'Cause my knees got weak 
Knocked off my feet 
I tried but I couldn't find the words to speak 
I can't let go my heart says WOW! 
Girl I gotta let you know 
I got this awesome amazing crazy kinda crush on you 
And though I try to forget you it doesn't Matter what I do 
On my mind all the time its a crime 
I can't deny its true 
'Cause I got this awesome amazing crazy Kinda crush on you 
Crazy 
Crazy 
Crush on you 
On the bus ride home 
I saw you were alone 
So I took my chance asked you to the dance 
And prayed you wouldn't say no! 
I just can't wait till Friday night 
Gonna hold your hand when the time is right 
Can't help but let my feelings show (Yeah) 
I'm gonna walk you home 
Talk on the phone 
Tell ya how I'm feelin' when we're all alone 
Gonna jump and shout sing it out loud 
Girl you no there'll be no doubt 
I got this awesome amazing crazy kinda crush on you 
And though I try to forget you it doesn't matter what I do 
On my mind all the time it's a crime 
I can't deny its true 
'Cause I got this awesome amazing crazy kinda crush on you 
Crazy 
Crazy
Crush on you 
Woo! 
Heya! 
Crazy kinda crush on you! 
'Cause my knees got weak 
Knocked off my feet 
I tried but I couldn't find the words to speak 
I can't let go my heart says WOW! 
Girl I gotta let you know 
I got this awesome amazing crazy kinda crush on you 
And though I try to forget you
It doesn't matter what I do 
On my mind all the time it's a crime 
I can't deny it's true 
'Cause I got this awesome amazing crazy kinda crush on you 
Crazy 
Crazy 
Crazy crush on you! 
Crazy 
Crazy
