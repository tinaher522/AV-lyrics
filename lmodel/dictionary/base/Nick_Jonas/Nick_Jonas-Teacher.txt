<song artist="Nick_Jonas" title="Teacher">
Right when I think I finally got you figured out
You turn around and blow my mind
So frustrated, girl you make me wanna shout
And it's only just the start of the night
And I'm like oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my god
Oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my god
Why you do me wrong
Why you do me wrong
When you that dress, and 
My heart it just can't take it anymore
Why you do me wrong
Why you do me wrong
When you act like this
It's like your mama never told you how to love
So let me teach ya
Take one step forward then we take a couple back
But you know I'm gonna keep up the pace
This game we're playing make me wanna break the rules
Can't let you get away from me, no no
Oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my god
Oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my god
Why you do me wrong
Why you do me wrong
When you that dress, and 
My heart it just can't take it anymore
Why you do me wrong
Why you do me wrong
When you act like this
It's like your mama never told you how to love
So let me teach ya
Dance with that body girl
'Cause everybody here is wanting that body girl
Dance with that body girl 
'Cause everybody here is wanting that body girl
Why you do me wrong
Why you do me wrong
When you that dress, and 
My heart it just can't take it anymore
Why you do me wrong
Why you do me wrong
When you act like this
It's like your mama never told you how to love
Why you do me wrong
Why you do me wrong
When you that dress, and 
My heart it just can't take it anymore
Why you do me wrong
Why you do me wrong
When you act like this
It's like your mama never told you how to love
So let me teach ya
So let me teach ya
