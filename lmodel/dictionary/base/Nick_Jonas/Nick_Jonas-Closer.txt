<song artist="Nick_Jonas" title="Closer">
All I really know is
That I felt okay
When I met you in April
You were looking like May
I know you like to run girl
So go and set the pace
The liquor never taste good
But I don't need a taste
Take another hit, just
Fake it till you feel it
Open up and let me in
I just wanna feel ya
Closer, closer
Close enough to feel this moment
Closer, closer
Close enough to feel this moment
Like the sun December
Or a lemon in June
I know what you want girl
'Cause I want it too
Have you ever noticed
That I can't see straight
'Cause I'm up in your body
Got me glued to your waste
Take another hit, just
Fake it till you feel it
Open up and let me in
I just wanna feel ya
Closer, closer
Close enough to feel this moment
Closer, closer
Close enough to feel this moment
Closer, closer
Close enough to feel this moment
Closer, closer
Close enough to feel this moment
I look good
I smell good
I fuck good too
I'm lookin' round like
She would, and she would and she probably would too
I'm sitting on the couch like it's my house
You a bad girl take a time out
Matter fact, you can bring a friend
My voice sound like silk in the wind
Henny bottles on my table
The owner was a fan so that's already paid for
Girls looking at me like I got a halo
I don't do second dates 
That's just how the game go
Look at my life, I made that shit
Look at my car, I suede that shit
Replay that shit
She don't fuck white boys
Imma change that shit
Closer, closer
Close enough to feel this moment
Closer, closer
Close enough to feel this moment
Closer, closer
Close enough to feel this moment
Closer, closer
Close enough to feel this moment
