<song artist="Nick_Jonas" title="Voodoo">
Up and down
You're shaking the solid ground
You're running me wild
And breaking me down, down
It's been wild
The way you do it, I don't know how
You're drinking me dry
Throwing fuel on the fire, fire
And we ain't in love
If this is what you call love
I swear I'm better alone
I feel your claws sinking in
Getting under my skin like
Voodoo yeah, yeah
Voodoo yeah, yeah
You got me too attached
Keep me coming right back
Just like that got me coming right back like
Voodoo yeah, yeah
Voodoo yeah, yeah
You got me too attached
Keep me coming right back
And I know that, I ain't fucking with your voodoo
And no more lies
Can't hold on to you this time
Phasing you out
Just a face in the crowd baby
And this ain't love
If this is what you call love
 I think I'm better alone
I feel your claws sinking in
Getting under my skin like
Voodoo yeah, yeah
Voodoo yeah, yeah
You got me too attached
Keep me coming right back
Just like that got me coming right back like
Voodoo yeah, yeah
Voodoo yeah, yeah
You got me too attached
Keep me coming right back
And I know that, I ain't fucking with your voodoo
Faking a rush
Is almost like calling it love
So why are you calling it love
Why are you calling it love
Voodoo yeah, yeah
Voodoo yeah, yeah
You got me too attached
Keep me coming right back
Just like that got me coming right back like
Voodoo yeah, yeah
Voodoo yeah, yeah
You got me too attached
Keep me coming right back
And I know that, I ain't fucking with your voodoo
