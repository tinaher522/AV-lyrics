<song artist="Nick_Jonas" title="Wrong_Again">
Wrong again, 
Father I hate to tell you this
You taught me how to hit the mark
And once again I missed,
Touch the fire
You always said that I get burned
Why is it so hard, to remember
All the lessons I have learned?
How can you look at me that way 
When I have failed so many times
Showing my love you tell the world 
This child is mine,
How can you walk that extra mile,
I see forgiveness in your smile
So should you reject me?
Wrong again
Once again, 
Lord I have wondered from your path
Thought I knew a better way
From a shorter word you've asked
Standing here,
I don't deserve a second chance
And I cant conceal the shame of you
To more I can stand, 
How can you look at me that way
When I have failed so many times
Showing me love you tell the world 
This child is mine,
How can u walk that extra mile,
I see forgiveness in your smile
So should deserve me?
Wrong again
When I look into your face,
And see the power of your grace
I find it so hard to believe
Forgiveness that your showing me,
I see the answer in your eyes
Love and mercy I realized
Finally the truth has set me free,
How can you look at me that way
When I have failed so many times
Showing me love you tell the world
This child is mine,
How can you walk that extra mile
I see forgiveness in your smile 
I thought you was going,
Instead your just holy,
Thought you would judge me,
Instead you just love me,
So should you reject me,
Wrong again
