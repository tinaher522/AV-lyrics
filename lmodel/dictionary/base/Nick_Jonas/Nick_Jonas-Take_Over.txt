<song artist="Nick_Jonas" title="Take_Over">
I can tell that you're a real bad girl underneath it all
You never wanna let me see the dark side
Go and let it show
This is our only chance
Let it happen
Catch me if you can
Let your naughty talk dirty thoughts for me
Take over, take over, take over
Let the crazy drug that you call love in me
Take over, take over, take over
Na na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na na
Take over, take over, take over
I wish that I could just read your mind
Tell me what I see
You always try to wear your disguise
Take it off for me
This is our only chance
Let it happen
Catch me if you can
Let your naughty talk dirty thoughts for me
Take over, take over, take over
Let the crazy drug that you call love in me
Take over, take over, take over
Na na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na na
Take over, take over, take over
I know you understand 
That I want you to stand 
Right wherever I am
I know you understand
That I want you to stand
Right wherever I am
This is our only chance
Let it happen
Catch me if you can
Let your naughty talk dirty thoughts for me
Take over, take over, take over
Let the crazy drug that you call love in me
Take over, take over, take over
Na na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na na
Take over, take over, take over
