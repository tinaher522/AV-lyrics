[FINCH:]
 Mr. Twimble
[MR. TWIMBLE:]
 Yes?
[FINCH:]
 You've been with this company a long time, haven't you?
[MR. TWIMBLE:]
 A long, long time. Just last month I became a quarter of a century man
[FINCH:]
 Aww, that's beautiful! Gee, a quarter of a century!
[MR. TWIMBLE:]
 A quarter of a century!
[FINCH:]
 And how long have you been in the mailroom?
[MR. TWIMBLE:]
 25 years. Yep! It takes a combination of skill, diplomacy and bold caution
 When I joined this firm
 As a brash young man
 Well I said to myself now brash young man
 Don't get any ideas, well, I stuck to that
 And haven't had one in years.
[FINCH:]
 Ah, you play it safe
[MR. TWIMBLE:]
 I play it the company way.
 Wherever the company puts me
 There I'll stay.
[FINCH:]
 But what's your point of view?
[MR. TWIMBLE:]
 I have no point of view!
[FINCH:]
 Supposing the company thinks
[MR. TWIMBLE:]
 I think so too!
[FINCH:]
 Now, what would you say if they put you-
[MR. TWIMBLE:]
 I wouldn't say!
[FINCH:]
 You're facing the company face
[MR. TWIMBLE:]
 It smiles at executives
 then goes back in place!
[FINCH:]
 The company furniture...
[MR. TWIMBLE:]
 Oh, it suits me fine!
[FINCH:]
 The company letterhead...
[MR. TWIMBLE:]
 A Valentine!
[FINCH:]
 Is there anything you're against?
[MR. TWIMBLE:]
 Unemployment!
[FINCH:]
 When they want brilliant thinking
 from employees
[MR. TWIMBLE:]
 That is no concern of mine
[FINCH:]
 Suppose a man of genius make suggestions
[MR. TWIMBLE:]
 What's that genius get suggested to resign?
[FINCH:]
 So, you play it the company way?
[MR. TWIMBLE:]
 Oh, company policy is by me ok.
[FINCH:]
 You'll never rise up to the top
[MR. TWIMBLE:]
 But there's one thing clear
 Whoever the company fires
 I will still be here!
[FINCH:]
 Oh, you certainly found a home.
[MR. TWIMBLE:]
 It's cozy
[FINCH:]
 Your brain is a company brain.
[MR. TWIMBLE:]
 The company washed it,
 Now I can't complain.
[FINCH:]
 The company magazine...
[MR. TWIMBLE:]
 Know what style, what punch
[FINCH:]
 The company restaurant
[MR. TWIMBLE:]
 Every day same lunch.
 Their hattock sandwich, it's delicious.
[FINCH:]
 I must try it!
[MR. TWIMBLE:]
 Early in the week.
[FINCH:]
 Do you have any hobbies?
[MR. TWIMBLE:]
 I've a hobby, I play gin with Mr. Bratt.
[FINCH:]
 And do you play it nicely?
[MR. TWIMBLE:]
 Play it nicely, still he blitzes me on every game like that!
[FINCH:]
 Why?
[MR. TWIMBLE:]
 'Cause I play it the company way.
 Executive policy is by me ok
[FINCH:]
 How can you get anywhere?
[MR. TWIMBLE:]
 Junior have no fear.
 Whoever the company fires
 I will still be here.
[FINCH:]
 You will still be here.
[MR. TWIMBLE:]
 Year, after year, after fiscal,
[BOTH:]
 Never take a risko year!
