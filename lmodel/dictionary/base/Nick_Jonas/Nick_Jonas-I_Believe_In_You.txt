[FRUMP:]
 Hello. What? No, the meeting's at 4:30.
 Meet me in the Executive Washroom. We'll make plans.
 Big meeting's today, huh? Yeah...
 Here anything about what Finch is planning?
 JB Gave him a postponement so he must have something
 Y'know fellas, I'm starting to get a little scared of Finch
 Me too. If we don't stop him pretty soon,
 He'll probably have us all working in the mailroom
[COMPANY:]
 Gotta stop that man.
 I've gotta stop that man cold or he'll stop me.
 Big deal, big rocket
 Thinks he has the world in his pocket.
 Gotta stop, gotta stop. gotta stop that man, that man.
[FINCH:]
 Now there you are.
 Yes, there's that face.
 That face that somehow I trust.
 It may embarrass you to hear me say it.
 But say it I must, say it I must
 You have the cool clear
 Eyes of a seeker of wisdom and truth
 Yet, there's that up-turned chin
 And the grin of impetuous youth
 Oh, I believe in you, I believe in you
 I hear the sound of good
 Solid judgment whenever you talk
 Yet there's the bold, brave spring
 Of the tiger that quickens your walk.
 Oh, I believe in you, I believe in you
 And when my faith in my fellow man
 Oh but falls apart
 I've but to feel your hand grasping mine
 And I take heart, I take heart
 To see the cool clear
 Eyes of a seeker of wisdom and truth
 Yet with the slam, bang, tang
 Reminiscent of gin and vermouth.
 Oh, I believe in you
 Oh, I believe in you
[COMPANY:]
 Gotta stop that man, gotta stop that man
 Or he'll stop me
 Big wheel, big beaver
 Boiling hot with front office fever
 Gotta stop, gotta stop, gotta stop that man
 (Oh, I believe in you)
 Don't let him be such a hero
 (I believe in you)
[COMPANY:]
 Stop that man, gotta stop it!
 (You)
 Stop that man, gotta stop it!
 (You)
 Stop that man, gotta stop it!
 (You)
 Man!
