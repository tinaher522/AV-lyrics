<song artist="Nick_Jonas" title="Avalanche">
Words like a loaded gun
Shot out from a fire tongue
Love lost from a fight that was won
But I can see you breaking down
The end to a falling out
I got pride, you can't hold your breath
We'll crash down like an avalanche
Look out now, don't take one more step
We'll crash down like an avalanche
Avalanche
I never wanted it to turn out this way
Now forever feels like yesterday
Sorry's something that I just can't say
Can you see me breaking down?
The end to a falling out, yeah yeah
I got pride, you can't hold your breath
Even if we survive
We'll crash down like an avalanche
Crash down, crash down
Look out now, don't take one more step
Even if we survive
We'll crash down like an avalanche
Crash down, crash down
Avalanche
Oooh oh oh
We'll crash down, yeah
Oooh oh oh
Like an avalanche 
I got pride, you can't hold your breath
We'll crash down like an avalanche
I got pride, you can't hold your breath
Even if we survive
We'll crash down like an avalanche
Crash down, crash down
Look out now, don't take one more step
Even if we survive
We'll crash down like an avalanche
Crash down, crash down
Avalanche
Oooh oh oh
Crash down, crash down
Oooh oh oh
Just like an avalanche
