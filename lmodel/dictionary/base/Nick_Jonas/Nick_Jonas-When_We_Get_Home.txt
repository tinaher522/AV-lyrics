<song artist="Nick_Jonas" title="When_We_Get_Home">
Talking crazy when you come back
It's not your fault I got a one track mind for you
I'm not your everything I know that
Keep waiting in this moment
Reality is coming
Ooh when we get home
It's over 
When we get home
We know we're crazy
We'll never make it
Ooh when we get home
(Are we there yet, are we almost home)
(Are we there yet, I don't wanna go)
When we get home
(Are we there yet, are we almost home) 
(Are we there yet, are we there yet)
When we 
Feeling hazy when you wake up
We knew we had to come down sometime but now
Yeah we're feeling so fucked up
We're choking on this moment
Reality is coming
Ooh when we get home
It's over 
When we get home
We know we're crazy
We'll never make it
Ooh when we get home
Are we there yet, are we almost home
Are we there yet, I don't wanna go
Are we there yet, are we almost home
Are we there yet, are we there yet
Ooh when we get home
It's over 
When we get home
We know we're crazy
We'll never make it
Ooh when we get home
Are we there yet, are we almost home
Are we there yet, I don't wanna go
Are we there yet, are we almost home
Are we there yet, are we there yet
We know we're crazy
We'll never make it
Ooh when we get home
Are we there yet, are we almost home
Are we there yet, are we there yet
