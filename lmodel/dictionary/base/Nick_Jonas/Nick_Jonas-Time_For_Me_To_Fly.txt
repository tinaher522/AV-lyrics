Oooooh ohhh oooohhhh ooohh
Yeahh
Oohhh ohh yeah
I've been wasting my time
I've been losing my mind
I've been running races
Still don't know what I've been chasing
But my eyes still can see
Bluer skies that wait for me
And I'm on my way
It's time for me to fly
It's time for me to soar
Time for me to open up my heart and knock on heaven's door
It's time for me to live
It's time for me to sing
Time for me to lay down all my worries and I'll spread my wings
Time for me to fly
The earth can be a heavy ride
When those clouds are in your eyes
But I feel a calling
I will rise, I won't be falling
And I'll escape the gravity
And I'll reach my destiny
And I'll fly away
It's time for me to fly
It's time for me to soar
Time for me to open up my heart and knock on heaven's door
It's time for me to live
It's time for me to sing
Time for me to lay down all my worries and I'll spread my wings
Time for me to fly
The gates of heaven will open wide
I will be, I will rise
There won't be compromise
As I take to the open skies
I will fly away
Time for me to fly
Time for me to fly
Time for me to fly
Time for me to fly
Time for me to fly
Time for me to fly
(Away)
It's time for me to fly
It's time for me to soar
Time for me to open up my heart and knock on heaven's door
It's time for me to live
It's time for me to sing
Time for me to lay down all my worries and I'll spread my wings
Time for me to fly
(Away)
You know what time it is
It's time for me to fly
(Away)
It's time to fly away
Time for me to fly
I will fly away (fly away)
I will fly away (fly away)
I will fly away, yeah
Lay down all my worries
(I will fly away)
Lay down all my troubles
(I will fly away)
Flyyyyyyy
(I will fly away)
I 
I will fly away
(woo!)
I will fly away
(oooooohhh)
I will fly away
Yeah
I will fly away
I will fly away
I will fly away
