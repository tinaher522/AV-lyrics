<song artist="Nick_Jonas" title="Nothing_Would_Be_Better">
Nothing is forever
Nothing would be better
Than the love you're giving me
I just gotta have you, wish you didn't have to
When you're gonna set me free
Like it or not
We were doomed from the start
I know that you'll agree
But nothing is forever
Nothing would be better
Better than you and me
Than you and me
Than you and me
I trade the worst of what you go
It hurts more than sticks and rocks
But you know I'll be there
You know I'll be there
And I will be your punching bag
Throw it all and don't hold back
But still I'll be there
You know I'll be there
'Cause I used to live in fear it was my home
But there are harder things to be than all alone
You're the broken part of me that makes me hope
So I'm sure
Nothing is forever
Nothing would be better
Than the love you're giving me
I just gotta have you, wish you didn't have to
When you're gonna set me free
Like it or not
We were doomed from the start
I know that you'll agree
But nothing is forever
Nothing would be better
Better than you and me
Than you and me
Than you and me
We don't turn around unless we're throwing stones
And we're crying like there's cracks all in our bones
You're the broken part of me that makes me hope
So I'm sure
Nothing is forever
Nothing would be better
Than the love you're giving me
And I just gotta have you, wish you didn't have to
When you're gonna set me free
Like it or not
We were doomed from the start
And I know that you'll agree
But nothing is forever
Nothing would be better
Better than you and me
