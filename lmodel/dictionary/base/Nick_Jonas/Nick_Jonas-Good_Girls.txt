Take another photo
Post it for the world to see
People that you don't know
Who hell you tryna please?
Perfect like a credit card
Where you'll never see the shards
Doctor, doctor patch the scars
Please
Looks like all the videos
Taught you how to wear your clothes
Got that look down to your toes
When did all these good girls
Decide to be bad 
Dacing up on the table getting back at your dad
Who's the asshole that told you
That's what you had to do
When did all these good girls
Decide to be bad
You know I love your skin but is it deeper than that
Don't wanna play you for it 
'Cause that's what we ask of you
But when did all these good girls
Going out to the girls in the club that put it down
You know sexy isn't just what you see
I aint mad at a little game of run around
As long as you can keep up with me
Perfect like a credit card
Where you'll never see the shards
Doctor, doctor patch the scars
Please knock, knock
Looks like all the videos
Taught you how to wear your clothes
Got that look down to your toes
When did all these good girls
Decide to be bad
Dancing up on the table getting back at your dad
Who's the asshole that told you
That's what you had to do
When did all these good girls
Decide to be bad
You know I love your skin but is it deeper than that
Don't wanna play you for it
'Cause that's what we ask of you
But when did all these good girls
But when did all these good girls
I used to be too bad for the good girls
Now I'm too good for the bad girls, no middle ground
Funny how big cities turn to little towns
When you tend to get around, I think we should sit it down
Girl you way too good to be in here
I see what they don't see and see it clear
I think we should prolly take a little time out
You know, slow it down, clear your mind out
Figure out what you're into
You don't strike me as a club girl, you seem more residential
To keep it real, I just want a bad girl tonight
And a good girl for life, all I seen was potential
When did all these good girls
Decide to be bad
You know I love your skin but it's much deeper than that
And gotta thank you for it 
For showing me all of you
When did all these good girls
Decide to be bad
Dancing up on the table getting back at your dad
Who's the asshole that told you
That's what you had to do
When did all these good girls
Decide to be bad
You know I love your skin but is it deeper than that
Don't wanna play you for it
'Cause that's what we ask of you
But when did all these good girls
