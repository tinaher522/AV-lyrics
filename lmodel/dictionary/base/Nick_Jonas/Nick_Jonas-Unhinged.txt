<song artist="Nick_Jonas" title="Unhinged">
Tell your mama and your brother you won't compromise
See my innocent decision keeps you up at night
Talking 'bout another man that you've been talking to
Just to see if I'll get mad and I'll fight for you
But that's not me
Right now my head isn't screwed on right
And I can't decide what I want
Every sweat just breaks me a little
And I know you can take this back and forth
It's not really safe for you in the middle
When you close that door you'll see
It's unhinged, it's just like me
You're not the first to try and diagnose what's wrong with me
I'll be the first to admit that I'm hard to please
I'm afraid to find out that I might be right for you
'Cause that's one step closer to life with you
And that's just not me
And right now my head isn't screwed on straight
And I can't decide what I want
Every sweat just breaks me a little
And I know you can take this back and forth
It's not really safe for you in the middle
When you close that door you'll see
It's unhinged, it's just like me
I ain't scared of my emotion
But I'm afraid to let you see
'Cause I know if I stay open
I won't be what you need
When you close that door you'll see
It's unhinged, it's just like me
If you close that door you'll see
You're unhinged you're just like me
