<song artist="Nick_Jonas" title="Wilderness">
Gotta have it
The feeling you give me is savage
Why do we all gotta make it complicated
Modern's overrated
Can we take it
Take it back to basics, oh 
We can rob it
With the moon and the stars up above us
Like the millions of years
Before we ever got together
A prehistoric pleasure
Can we take it
Take it back to basics, oh yeah
Naked as the day we were born
Did you know it could feel like this, feel like this
I'll take your body back, take it back
Take it back to the wilderness
Wilderness
Let's take it back
Let's take it back
Before the fire
We discovered desire
There's no use talking, just let me hear you breathing
Or are you overheating
Can we take it 
Can we take it back to basics, oh yeah
Naked as the day we were born
Did you know it could feel like this, feel like this
I'll take your body back, take it back
Take it back to the wilderness
Wilderness
Let's take it back
Let's take it back
I'll take it back
Let's take it back
I'll take it back (take it back)
Oh no no no
Take it back (take it back)
I, I'll take it back (take it back)
Oh, oh no
I'll take it back
Get naked as 
Naked as the day we were born
Did you know it could feel like this, feel like this
I'll take your body back, take it back
Take it back to the wilderness
Wilderness
Let's take it back
Let's take it back
Let's take it back
Let's take it back
Let's take it back
