<song artist="Nick_Jonas" title="Numb">
This is so dumb
This is so bad
Gotta be numb, to miss you like that
Lifting me up
Lettin' me fall
Fuck with my head like it's nothing at all
You were my sun
You were my Earth
I was your best 
And you were my worst
Breakin' my heart one piece at a time
Well, here's a piece of my mind, yeah
You don't know what it is you do to me
Yeah, you stole my heart
And all I have is a whole where it used to be
And the hardest part
Girl you got some substitute for me
But it's not gon work
You don't know what it is you do to me
Yeah, you leave me
Numb
Yeah, you leave me
Numb
Numb
Losing my mind 
Losing control
Swallow my pride
You swallow me whole
Smile on my face, to cover my hurt
Spent so much time, but what was that worth
I'm broke and I'm blind
I'm taping it up
Flaws in my head, mistaken for love
Nails in my back, they don't mean a thing
They ain't yours
They ain't yours
 
You don't know what it is you do to me
Yeah, you stole my heart
And all I have is a whole where it used to be
And the hardest part
Girl you got some substitute for me
But it's not gon work
You don't know what it is you do to me
Yeah, you leave me
Numb
Numb
Yeah you leave me 
Numb
Numb
Yeah, you leave me
I got trapped off in a blackbox lived on a matchbox in your rage
You said we are merely players who still act off of this stage
I kept begging you to stay like baby please don't leave me
Know you don't like fall but what's one more season?
And I dream on, you gettin' your plot and your scheme on
And I just be here with my theme song
He love me, he love me, no he don't
Cause you make me feel like the night before Christmas
Love is a crime and I'm stuck in your prison
Far as you want, baby I'll go the distance
If you're numb and I'm numb then what is we feelin'?
You don't know what it is you do to me
Yeah, you stole my heart
And all I have is a whole where it used to be
And the hardest part
Girl you got some substitute for me
But it's not gon work
You don't know what it is you do to me
Yeah, you leave me
Numb
Numb
Yeah you leave me 
Numb
Numb
Yeah, you leave me
Numb
