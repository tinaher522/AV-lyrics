<song artist="Nick_Jonas" title="That's_What_They_All_Say">
Too broke to pay attention, got it for the low
So all I really have is a penny for your thoughts,
but I really wanna know, yeah, I really wanna know, oh
I've been on a mission, hazy from the smoke
Turning all these issues into solid gold
But I really wanna know, you saying we should let it go
That's what they all say
So I don't mind (So I don't mind)
Yeah but they all come back in due time
But if you haven't noticed, I've been getting mine
That's what they all say
That's what they all say
Got a one way ticket, searching for the show
Preach you're on a mission, everywhere I go
But I really wanna know, yeah I really wanna know
'Cause my feet are in the sand and I'm thinking 'bout snow
Tell me how is Pepsi really different than Coke?
Yeah I really wanna know, I really wanna know
(Don't you?)
That's what they all say
So I don't mind (So I don't mind)
Yeah but they all come back in due time
But if you haven't noticed, I've been getting mine
That's what they all say
That's what they all say
I'll be on a boat built for two, yeah
I'll be on it waiting for you, oh
Nothing like Jamaica in June (ain't nothing like it)
I'll be right there waiting for you, no, no, no
That's what they all say
So I don't mind (So I don't mind)
Yeah but they all come back in due time
But if you haven't noticed, I've been getting mine
(Getting money)
That's what they all say
That's what they all say
(Listen, listen)
That's what they all say
So I don't mind (So I don't mind)
Yeah but they all come back in due time
But if you haven't noticed, I've been getting mine
(Hundred dolla bills)
That's what they all say
That's what they all say
(Stop)
