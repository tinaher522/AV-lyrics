<song artist="Nick_Jonas" title="I_Want_You">
Motha fucka never love me
Motha fucka never love me
So I take it back
What I deserve
'Cause I deserve better
And you say never need me
Yeah you say you're gonna leave me
But I like to see you try it babe
'Cause I ain't gonna let you go
Moving on
Gotta take control
Staying strong
But it's taking home
Can't go back
Never going back, back, back
I want you 
No one else
I want you 
For myself
I want you
And nothing else will do
No one acting confused
I got nothing to lose
I want you
And if I can't have you
No one will
So when you think about me?
I know you think about me
'Cause it scared you that I know everything
Now I won't keep quiet
You got the key to my heart yeah
I got the key to your apartment
Will you let me in
Or we're breaking in
'Cause I ain't gonna let you go
Moving on
Gotta take control
Staying strong
But it's taking home
Can't go back
Never going back, back, back
I want you 
No one else
I want you 
For myself
I want you
And nothing else will do
No one acting confused
I got nothing to lose
I want you
And if I can't have you
Oh if I see you with someone else
Imma lose my head
If I hurt your love for myself
Don't what I'll do
I want you 
No one else
I want you 
For myself
I want you
And nothing else will do
I'll never let you go
Never let you go
Never let you go
I'll never let you go 
I want you
I want you 
No one else
I want you 
For myself
I want you
And nothing else will do
No one acting confused
I got nothing to lose
I want you
And if I can't have you
Oh if I see you with someone else
Imma lose my head
If I hurt your love for myself
Don't what I'll do
I want you 
No one else
I want you 
For myself
I want you
And nothing else will do
And nothing else will do
