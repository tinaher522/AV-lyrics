<song artist="Nick_Jonas" title="Dear_God">
Dear God,
I'd hate to be a bother, but I gotta say
This world is getting crazier with every day
I hope you'll hear me out now as I stop and pray
Dear God,
People take your words and try to twist them 'round
I know you can't be happy with what's going down
I'm searching for some answers but they can't be found
Can you help me out, dear God?
Dear God,
Just the other night I heard somebody say
What's the use believing in you anyway
I guess it was just heartache talking through the pain
It's a crying shame
Dear God,
I know you're disappointed in the things we've done
Can't they see the truth that they're all running from?
Trying to preach a message with a loaded gun
What they thinking of, dear God?
Everybody's searching for an easy solution, yeah
They can't see beyond the selfish world they're living in
Words of love get lost in all the confusion, yes they do
But I still believe... someday you're gonna speak to me
Dear God,
I know you've got a million other calls to take
You're dealing with a lot of things that just won't wait
But there is one request that I just gotta make
Dear God,
Won't you send a sign down just to ease my doubt
I'm trying to hear you but the silence is so loud
I think I see a rainbow from behind the clouds
And I hear you now, dear God
