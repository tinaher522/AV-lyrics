<song artist="Nick_Jonas" title="The_Difference">
You never had a love like this
Baby not this kind
You ain't never been touched like this
Feel it down your spine
I ain't never been one to miss
Don't plan on starting tonight
I think I could be the perfect fit
In your life
You're looking for love
You say nothing's good, good enough
You've been broken like way too much
Let me fix you baby
'Cause you're way too tongue tied
You keep it on the low
But you know you're body wants mine
Why you tryna go when you know 
I'll never waste your time
If you don't feel the difference when you walk away
'Cause you're gonna learn today
I'll show you the difference baby
I'll show you the difference baby
I'll love you like a grown ass man
Pushing all your buttons
I'll let in, in all my plance
You might learn some day
And you might be surprised
What you get out of it
These clothes keep you confined
So just get out of them
You're looking for love
You say nothing's good, good enough
You've been broken like way too much
Let me fix you baby
'Cause you're way too tongue tied
You keep it on the low
But you know you're body wants mine
Why you tryna go when you know 
I'll never waste your time
If you don't feel the difference when you walk away
'Cause you're gonna learn today
I'll show you the difference baby
I'll show you the difference baby
And you will be surprised
What you get out of it
These clothes keep you confined
So just get out of them
I will redefine
All the damages and fix it
I'm on a mission
Show you the difference
You're looking for love
You say nothing's good, good enough
You've been broken like way too much
Let me fix you baby
'Cause you're way too tongue tied
You keep it on the low
But you know you're body wants mine
Why you tryna go when you know 
I'll never waste your time
If you don't feel the difference when you walk away
'Cause you're gonna learn today
I'll show you the difference baby
I'll show you the difference baby
