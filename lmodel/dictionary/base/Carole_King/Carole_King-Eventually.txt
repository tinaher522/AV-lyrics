<song artist="Carole_King" title="Eventually">
Was a time I remember
Hope flashed and went dim
When assassins just happened
To do the right people in
And love was a slogan
Coincidentally
And they told us they'd work it out 
Eventually
In the swing of changing times
A man cried out for his
And every politician said
He was telling us like it is
Yes, they walked down the angry streets
To have themselves a look- see
And they told us they'd work it out
Eventually
I see the choking cities
I see them tearing up this earth
I see people feeling
That their lives have little worth
And I know that the future
Depends on you and me
I hope we can work it out
Eventually
I hope we can work it out
Eventually
Hey, maybe someday
Hey, maybe someday
Hey, maybe someday
Eventually
