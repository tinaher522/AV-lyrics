<song artist="Carole_King" title="You've_Been_Around_Too_Long">
Ooh, I hear you say attitudes and times have changed
And I know the feeling--it's long overdue
You say this is a time to right old wrongs
Tell me now, if it's true
You got the mind, you got the time
How long are you gonna wait to do what you want to do now
You've been around too long
Not to notice what's going on in town
You've got to understand
I'm taking my life in my own hands
And gaining ground--look around
Peace of mind
You got yours--I want mine
If you really want to do right by me
See what you want to see
But let me be what I want to be
'Cause you've been around too long
Not to realize what's going on inside
I'm just like you
I'm doing the best that I can do to make my stride
