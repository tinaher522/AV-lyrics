<song artist="Carole_King" title="Two_Hearts">
Getting off the freeway
Shaking off a bad day
Got to change the feeling
And it doesn't matter how
Suddenly I see you
Pulling in the driveway
I can't wait to hold you
And it doesn't matter now
I go to kiss you on the shoulder
But I feel you leave, you moving away
You've got to tell me what you're thinking
How else am I supposed to know?
We've got to put our hearts together
And let the love between us grow, two hearts
Standing in the kitchen
Just passed the doorway
I reach out to touch you
But you just turn away
I wanna make you happy
And I'll do it your way
Whatever it is, just tell me
We can't go on this way
Everyday we're both a little older
Don't you feel the time rushing away?
You've got to tell me what you're thinking
How else am I supposed to know?
We've got to put our hearts together
And let the love between us grow, two hearts
Beating together, two hearts
Standing alone, two hearts
Each one believing
Take a look at us, take a look at us
Take a look at these two hearts
Everyday we're both a little older
Don't you feel the time rushing away?
You've got to tell me what you're thinking
How else am I supposed to know?
We've got to put our hearts together
And let the love between us grow, two hearts
Beating together, two hearts
Standing alone, two hearts
Each one believing, two hearts
Standing alone, two hearts
