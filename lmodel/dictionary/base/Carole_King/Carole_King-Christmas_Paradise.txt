<song artist="Carole_King" title="Christmas_Paradise">
Snow cones in the sun and palm trees swaying
Down on the beach Feliz Navidad is playing
And ohhh, I oughtta miss the Christmas as I always knew
But here I am in paradise with you, just me and you, wishes come true
No crackling fire or chestnuts roasting,
But we got some coconuts and rum for toasting
Don't need a snowman we'll build castles in the sand
I'm in a Christmas Paradise
You and me underneath a beach umbrella, we don't need no mistletoe at all
No need to hurry we don't have to worry there's no where else to be
But the starry sky and the Christmas lights when the sun sets on the sea
Aqui en el Paraiso
I'm in a Christmas Paradise
You and me in Christmas Paradise
Dime que si, on the beach it's very nice
You and me in Christmas Paradise
Aqui en el Paraiso
I'm in Christmas Paradise with you
You and me in Christmas Paradise
Dime que si, on the beach it's very nice
You and me in Christmas Paradise
Aqui en el Paraiso
It's Christmas time and I'm in Paradise
We won't miss the snow at all
Cause I'm with you in Christmas Paradise
