<song artist="Carole_King" title="At_This_Time_In_My_Life">
At this time in my life very conscious of who I am 
I know that who I am doesn't matter 
All the chatter that goes on between 
As we talked around what we really mean 
Really makes me wonder 
At this time in my life 
(At this time in my life) 
A feeling I can't control 
is creeping up inside my soul and growing 
What is it all about 
Wouldn't knowing help me to work it out 
I can't be afraid of thunder 
At this time in my life 
(At this time in my life x2) 
At this time in my life let me stop 
let me take control of myself and be me 
I can see me in a few years 
trying to see where reality has gone 
I won't let it take me under 
At this time in my life 
I won't let it take me under 
At this time in my life
