<song artist="Carole_King" title="Child_Of_Mine_(Live)">
Although you see the world
Different than me 
Sometimes I can touch upon
The wonders that you see
All the new colours
And pictures you've designed
Oh yes sweet darling
So glad you are a child of mine 
Child of mine,
Child of mine,
Oh yes sweet darling,
So glad you are a child of mine 
You don't need direction
You know which way to go
And I don't wanna hold you back
I just wanna watch you grow 
'Cos you're the one who taught me
You don't have to look behind
Oh yes sweet darling
So glad you are a child of mine 
Nobody's gonna steal your dreams 
Or tell you how to live your life 
There'll always be people to make it hard for a while, 
But you'll change their heads when they see you smile 
The times you were born in
May not have been the best, 
But you can make the times to come
Better than the rest 
I know you will be honest
If you can't always be kind
Oh yes sweet darling
So glad you are a child of mine
Child of mine
Child of mine, 
Oh yes sweet darling 
So glad you are a child of mine 
Child of mine
Child of mine, 
Oh yes sweet darling 
So glad you are a child of mine
