<song artist="Carole_King" title="Dancin'_With_Tears_In_My_Eyes">
Never been the kind to stay at home
Even when I'm feeling down
So every night I go out on the town
Circulating around
Well, I thought I could forget about you
But every night I find
It's not as easy as I thought it would be
To dance you out of my mind
You've got me dancin' with tears in my eyes
Dancin' with tears in my eyes
You've got me dancin' with a hurt in my soul
I can't control my emotions
Ever since we said our goodbyes
Don't you know you can find me any old time
Dancin' with tears in my eyes
Dancin' with tears in my eyes
Dancin' with tears in my eyes
Dancin' with tears in my eyes
Now anything can happen in this day and age
Just take a look at me
My body keeps moving to the happy beat
While my spirit's in misery
You can't see it with the strobe lights flashing
No, I don't look out of place
But there's a whole different picture you'll see of me
When you get a look at my face
You'll see me dancin' with tears in my eyes
Dancin' with tears in my eyes
You'll see me dancin' with a hurt in my soul
I can't control my emotions
Ever since we said our goodbyes
Don't you know you can find me, you know you can find me
Don't you know you can find me any old time
Dancin' with tears in my eyes
Dancin' with tears in my eyes
Dancin' with tears in my eyes
Dancin' with tears in my eyes
