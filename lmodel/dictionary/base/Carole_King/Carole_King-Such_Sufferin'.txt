<song artist="Carole_King" title="Such_Sufferin'">
What a life it is
The hardships, the tears
The desperate years
Such sufferin'
Gimme a Bufferin!
And what have I got?
True, it's a lot!
But so what?
There's got to be more to being so great
To looking first-rate and staying out late
Just look at the state I'm in!
Oh!
Such sufferin'
My days are full of sufferin' and
Bufferin
I've really learned the hard way
That pastas and cakes
And french fries and steaks
Are not such great shakes
That castles in Spain
Are just a big pain
That life is inane
If you're sufferin'
I'm not blufferin'!
Can't wonders like me
Learn how to be
Happy and grateful
For just a mere plateful
Of life's simple goodies?
I wish it were so 
But the answer is NO!
So I suffa
Get tougha
And don't get enougha 
Anything
Us Super-Dupers
Are regular troopers
We give all we got
And believe it or not
That's a lot!
The standing ovations!
The keys to all nations!
Bermuda vacations!
Money! Success!
I'd settle for less
If I could stop this
SUFFERIN'!
Oh such sufferin'
Foo on such sufferin'
Poo on such sufferin'
Oh, nuts to all this sufferin'
Gimme a Bufferin
