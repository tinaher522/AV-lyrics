<song artist="Carole_King" title="Welcome_Home">
I have opened up my mind to things 
I was afraid of
Done things I've never done before
Taken a chance and seen just what 
the world is made of
Nothing is the same any more
At times I feel a golden spirit coming through me
Thinking of my life and what it's given to me
I will live within that spirit ever knowing
I'm where I'm supposed to be
Welcome Home
In the waters I can see a clear refelection
Of the force that's all around
There's a harmony of season and direction
This is surely sacred ground
Sweet life is everywhere as we stand in the clover
Feel the circle magic, let it take us over
And through all that I've been blessed 
with I feel certain
I'm where I'm supposed to be
Welcome Home
