THAT'S HOW THINGS GO DOWN
by Carole King
Here I am
Carrying the child of our sweet love
And you're far away
That's how things go down
But I want to see you again
Though I've known
Others in life who've made it on their own
I'm afraid
That's how things go down
But I want to see you again
Hey, with each day that passes by
I pray that I will see you soon
And you will be here with me
To see the child being born
Safe and sound
All I can do is wait and hope that you'll
Be around
That's how things go down
I want to see you again
In the end
All I can do is wait and hope that you'll 
Be around
That's how things go down
I want to see you again
That's how things go down
I want to see you again
