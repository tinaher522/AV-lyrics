I'D LIKE TO KNOW YOU BETTER
by Carole King
I'd like to know you better
There's so much about you I can see
There's a love as good as gold in you
I can feel it when I'm holding you
I want ot be your friend, your lover
I'd like to know you better
Being with you feel so good to me
In a world of distraught humanity
You have brought me to my sanity
How lucky you are
We seem to get along so well
Whether or not we'll stay that way
It's much to early to tell
But I'd like to know you better
Though I alrready feel as if I do
Meeting you has been so good for me
And if only temporarily
I want ot be your friend, your lover
Yes, I'd like to know you better
