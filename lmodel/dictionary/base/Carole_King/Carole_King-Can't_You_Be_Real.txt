<song artist="Carole_King" title="Can't_You_Be_Real">
Long ago we had our dreams
And that was all that we needed
Then all at once we got to see
The cycles we repeated
Baby, can't you be real?
Baby, can't you be real?
Anyone can look into your eyes
And tell you what you're missin'
It's been told to you many times before
But you refuse to listen
Baby, can't you be real?
I say, baby, can't you be real?
