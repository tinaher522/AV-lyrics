FERGUSON ROAD
by Gerry Goffin &amp; Carole King
I'm gonna head on up to the old Ferguson Road
Stand beneath the trees and see how tall I am
Yes, I'm goona wade in a cold rocky stream
So I will be sure not to give a damn
No one ever loses anybody
But someitme it's so hard to get along
I don't want to hang on to anybody
So before you say you're leaving, i'll be gone
I'm gonna head on up to the old Ferguson Road
Find myself a spot where the sun shines through
I'll throw some old mattress in the back of my bus
And get a good head start on forgetting you
You know I've never known anybody
Who could ever make me feel this way
But no one gets to own anybody
You see, I have good reason when I say
I'm gonna head on up to the old Ferguson Road
Stand beneath the trees and see how tall I am
Yes, I'm goona wade in a cold rocky stream
So I will be sure not to give a damn
