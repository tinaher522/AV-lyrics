<song artist="Carole_King" title="I_Wasn't_Gonna_Fall_In_Love">
When I met you, I let you know
I didn't want to go the way I'd gone before
That door was closed--I was just looking for fun
And you were the right one, you got it
So we could just play around
We wouldn't get serious or mysterious
When it's done it would just be done
I wasn't gonna fall in love, no, I wasn't gonna fall
I wasn't gonna fall in love, till I fell in love with you
Well, you got down, saw through me
You read me like a book
You took me over and over again
And you turned my head around
I found I didn't know what I thought I knew 
I was caught up in you so fast
Emotional, love potion-al
I want to make every moment last
I wasn't gonna fall in love, no, I wasn't gonna fall
I wasn't gonna fall in love, till I fell in love with you
Never know what's gonna, never know what's gonna come along
To change your mind, change your way
Play the game you said you'd never play
Never thought that we, never thought you and I would be together
Well I thought I could, but I guess you can't
You can't, you can't ever
Never say never
I wasn't gonna fall in love, no, I wasn't gonna fall
I wasn't gonna fall in love, till I fell in love with you
