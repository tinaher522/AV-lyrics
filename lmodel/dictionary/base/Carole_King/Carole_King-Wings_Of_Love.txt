<song artist="Carole_King" title="Wings_Of_Love">
You fill me with love I can give
You fill me with life I can live
You fill me with song I can sing
And truth that makes the kingdoms ring
On love's music we fly
We soar ever-so-high
Through clouds of harmony
And down through the sky
We flow to a place
Where people kiss each other's eyes
And the sweet-sounding smell
That looks like a Rocky Mountain spring
Blossoming sighs
And the rainbow people build bridges of life
That blend our hearts
For the eternal now
</song>
