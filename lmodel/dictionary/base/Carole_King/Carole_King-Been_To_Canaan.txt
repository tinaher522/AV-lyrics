<song artist="Carole_King" title="Been_To_Canaan">
Green fields and rolling hills
Room enough to do what we will
Sweet dreams of yestertime
Are running though my mind
Of a place I left behind
Been so long, I can't remember when
I've been to Canaan and I wanna go back again
Been so long, I'm living till then
Cause I've been to Canaan and, ah, I won't rest until I go back again
Though I'm content with myself
Sometimes I long to be somewhere else
I try to do what I can
But with our day to day demands
We all need a promised land
And it's been so long
I can't remember when
I've been to Canaan and I wanna go back again
Been so long
I'm living till then
Cause I've been to Canaan and, ah, I won't rest until I go back again
Oh, I want to be there in the wintertime
With a fireplace burning to warm me
And you to hold me
When it's stormy
Been so long, I can't remember when
But I've been to Canaan and I wanna go back again
Been so long, I'm living till then
Cause I've been to Canaan and, ah, I won't rest until I go back again
I've been to Canaan and, ah, I won't rest until I go back again
