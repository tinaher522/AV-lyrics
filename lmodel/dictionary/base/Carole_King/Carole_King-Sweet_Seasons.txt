<song artist="Carole_King" title="Sweet_Seasons">
Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose
And sometimes the blues get a hold of you
Ah, just when you thought you had made it
All around the block people will talk
But I want to give it all that I got
I just don't want, I don't want to waste it
Talking 'bout-a sweet seasons on my mind
Sure does appeal to me
You know we can get there easily
Just like a sailboat sailing on the sea
Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose
And most times you choose between the two
Ah, wondering, wondering if you have made it
But I'll have some kids and make my plans
And I'll watch the seasons running away
And I'll build me a life in the open, a life in the country
I'm talking 'bout-a sweet seasons on my mind
Sure does appeal to me
You know we can get there easily
Just like a sailboat a-sailing on the sea
Talkin' 'bout-a sweet seasons
Talkin' 'bout-a sweet, sweet, sweet seasons
Talkin' 'bout-a sweet seasons
Talkin' 'bout-a sweet seasons
