One was Johnny
(One was Johnny)
1 was Johnny who lived by himself
2 was a rat who jumped on his shelf
3 was a cat who chased the rat
4 was a dog who came in and sat
5 was a turtle who bit the dog's tail
6 was a monkey who brought in the mail
7 a blackbird pecked poor Johnny's nose
(One was Johnny)
8 was a tiger out selling old clothes
9 was a robber who took an old shoe
10 was a puzzle--what should Johnny do
(One was Johnny)
He stood on a chair and said,
Here's what I'll do--I'll start to 
Count backwards
And when I am through
If this house isn't empty, I'll eat
All of you!
9 was the robber who left looking pale
8 was the tiger who chased him to jail
7 was the blackbird flew off to Havana
6 was the monkey who stole the banana
5 was the turtle who crawled off to bed
4 was the dog who slid home on a sled
(One was Johnny)
3 was the cat who pounced on the rat
2 was the rat who left with the cat
One was Johnny
(One was Johnny) 
One was Johnny
(One was Johnny)
1 was Johnny who lived by himself
And liked it like that!
(One was Johnny)
