SO MANY WAYS
by Carole King
So many ways
So many ways to show you love someone
So many ways to show someone you care
We have so much in common
ALthough we come from places worlds apart
When you reach out and touch my hand
Without a word you say I love you
You're beautiful
You are in my heart
So many ways
So many ways to show you love someone
So many ways to show someone you care
Since I've been spending all my time with you
You've taught me something new every day
And I just want to say
The music comes from you and me
And it's plain to see that we both know
So many ways
So many ways to show you love someone
So many ways to show someone you care
