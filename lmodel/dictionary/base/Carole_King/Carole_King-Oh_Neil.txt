<song artist="Carole_King" title="Oh_Neil">
Oh! Neil
I've loved you for so long
I never dreamed you'd put me in a song
I'm Carol
And I live in Tennessee
I never hoped that you'd remember me
Darling, when I saw you at the square dance
My pulse skipped a beat
My heart felt so heavy
Like I had too much to eat
Then you took me walking in the moonlight
It was, oh, so sublime
I had too much molasses
And your lips stuck to mine
Oh! Neil
I'd even give up a month's supply of chewin' tobacky
Just to be known as Mrs. Neil Sedaky
My Grandpappy, he don't like your records
He said if I play them, I will surely die
Lookout, I see him comin' with his shotgun!
There's nothing left to do\
Oh! Neil
I'll surely die for you!
(Shotgun blast)
(Grandpappy) I told that gal not to play them dad-gum Neil Sedaky records!
