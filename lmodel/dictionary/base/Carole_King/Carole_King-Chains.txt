<song artist="Carole_King" title="Chains">
Chains, my baby's got me locked up in chains
And they ain't the kind that you can see
Woh these chains of love got a hold on me yeah
Chains, well I can't break away from these chains
Can't run around 'cause I'm not free
Woh these chains of love won't let me be
Now believe me when I tell you
I think you're fine, I'd like to hold you
But I can't break away from all of these chains
My baby's got me locked up in chains
And they ain't the kind that you can see
Woh these chains of love got a hold on me yeah
I wanna tell you pretty baby 
Your lips look sweet, I'd like to kiss them
But I can't break away from all these chains
My baby's got me locked up in chains
And they ain't the kind that you can see
Woh these chains of love got a hold on me yeah
My baby's got me locked up in chains
And they ain't the kind that you can see
Woh these chains of love got a hold on me yeah
Chains
Chains of love
Chains of love
Oh these chains of love gotta hold on me
