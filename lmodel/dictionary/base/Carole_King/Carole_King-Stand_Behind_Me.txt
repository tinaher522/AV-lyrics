STAND BEHIND ME
by Carole King
I was wanting someone to talk to
Needing to let myself out
Knowing beyond a doubt the past is behind me
There was nowhere but here to walk to
Letting the time go by
Trying to see if I could ever find me.
It didn't seem to make much sense
Thinking about the dent I'd made 
in the world to date
Was I too late, you say
Should I create today
Or let it be
Now needing a hand to cling to
Lucky I was to find
SOmeone of similar mind to stand behind me
Not letting dazzlement blind me
Showing me where to find me
Willing to just be kind and stand behind me.
