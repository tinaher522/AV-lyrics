MY LOVIN' EYES
by Carole King &amp; David Palmer
It's hard enough to hear you
Express your sympathy
But it's harder still to feel the things
My eyes refuse to see
Oh, my lovin' eyes
When you look upon them darlin' like you do
You bring these tears into
my lovin' eyes
I watch you take my self respect
Accepting each excuse
When I've never seen the reason
For your moods or abuse
Oh, my lovin' eyes
They hold you like the heaven holds the sun
But look what you've done to
my lovin' eyes
Like a man whose way is righteous
His faith in life resigned
I'm a child whose eyes are sightless
And my faith in you is truly blind
It's sad to think of living
As pain that we must feel
But it's sadder still to think of love
As something you conceal
Oh, my lovin' eyes
When you look upon them darlin' like you do
You bring these tears into
my lovin' eyes
