<song artist="Carole_King" title="He's_A_Bad_Boy">
Mama doesn't like him 'cause he never cuts his hair
Daddy doesn't like him 'cause he says he heard him swear
He's a bad boy
But I don't care
He's not happy working, he's got no use for school
Never feels the least bit sorry when he treats me cruel
He's a bad boy
But I'm a fool
Don't it kinda break your heart now, don't it make you sad
When the boy you love so much turns out to be so bad
He's a bad boy
A bad boy, oh yeah
Don't it kinda break your heart now, don't it make you sad
When the boy you love so much turns out to be so bad
He's a bad boy
He's a bad boy
He's a bad boy
Oh yeah
