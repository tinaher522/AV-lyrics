<song artist="Carole_King" title="Like_Little_Children">
I don't remember just exactly how it started
All I know is we're both alone and broken-hearted
It doesn't make a bit of sense to me
Why should two people in love have to be
Like little children who don't know wrong from right
Like little children who just can't help but fight
Why should two grown people have to act
Like little children
There's no storm that you and I can't weather
If we just take the time to talk it out together
But when talking stops, tempers rise
And we both do things that aren't wise
Like little children who don't know wrong from right
Like little children who just can't help but fight
Why should two grown people have to act
Like little children
Now I'm not saying you've got to do
Everything that I say
But you've got to realize
That life is a two-way highway
Let's forget about the past and look to the new horizon
Being happy together is the goal we'll keep our eyes on
Love for each other, we never lacked
And oh, I know that we don't have to act
Like little children who don't know wrong from right
Like little children who just can't help but fight
Like little children
Like little children
