<song artist="Carole_King" title="Lady">
If the thoughts in my head could reach a great distance
And somehow get into your mind
They'd tell you much more than all the words I could speak
From now till the end of time
Lady, now are you a lady
Do you like the one your beauty's been sold to
How does it feel when he holds you
As you reap the sad harvest of wanting too much
Determined you still feel alive
Now and then looking back to all you've forsaken
Nothing to do but survive
Lady, now are you a lady
Do you like the one your beauty's been sold to
How does it feel when he holds you
Being who you are, couldn't you tell
Knowing what you know, how could you sell
Lady, now are you a lady
Lady, now are you a lady 
Lady, now are you a lady
