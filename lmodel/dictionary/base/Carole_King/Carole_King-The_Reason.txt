<song artist="Carole_King" title="The_Reason">
Words and Music by 
Carole King, Mark Hudson &amp; Greg Wells 
I figured it out
I was high and low and everything in between
I was wicked and wild, baby, you know what I mean
Till there was you, yeah, you
Something went wrong
I made a deal with the devil for an empty IOU
Been to Hell and back, but an angel 
was looking through
It was you, yeah, you - it's all because of you
[Chorus] 
You are the reason
You are the reason I wake up every day
And sleep through the night
You are the reason, the reason
In the middle of the night
I'm going down 'cause I adore you
I want to floor you
I'm giving it up
No more running around spinning my wheel
You came out of my dream and made it real
I know what I feel
It's you - it's all because of you
[Chorus]
In the middle of the night
I'm going down because I want you
I want to touch you
I want to floor you
You are the reason, baby
[Chorus]
