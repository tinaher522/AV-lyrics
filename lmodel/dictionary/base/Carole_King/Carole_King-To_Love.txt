<song artist="Carole_King" title="To_Love">
Down the road a piece he was waiting
Yes, he was waiting and you know me
I had had my fill of hesitating
And I always knew it had to be
To love, to love, to love, to love
All you need's the opportunity 
To love, to love, to love, to love
Baby, don't you make a fool of me
I never will forget our first encounter
Yes, I'm proud to say that it was all right
And I was so glad that I had found him
As ready as I was that night
To love, to love, to love, to love
All you need's the opportunity 
To love, to love, to love, to love
Baby, don't you make a fool of me
There are those of us too cool for passion
They're the ones that it could do some good
And there are those who say it's out of fashion
They're the ones who only wish they could
To love, to love, to love, to love
All you need's the opportunity 
To love, to love, to love, to love
Baby, don't you make a fool of me
Baby, don't you make a fool of me
Baby, don't you make a fool of me
Baby, don't you make a fool of me
Baby, don't you make a fool of me
