<song artist="Carole_King" title="God_Only_Knows">
Looks to me like
I'm flyin' in a pattern I want to break 
Sometimes I feel like 
I've given enough, now I want to take
It's makin' me crazy 
Thinkin' about where it's all gonna lead
And I wonder 
If we're gonna get what we need
God only knows
You're travelin' easy 
Keeping your mind in an amber haze
But there's so much between you 
And the natural land up on which you were raised
It's easy to turn your head 
And not think about when it all comes down
Don't you wonder 
If you're gonna be around
God only knows
Maybe it's not for me to understand
Maybe destruction is part of the plan
Well, I don't really see 
How it can be
Why it should be, I don't know
I just don't know
I can't stop dreamin' 
About leavin' it all behind
Maybe I'll never get there 
Except in my mind
It sure makes me angry 
To realize that I'm caught in a game
I used to love everybody
Now it's so hard to do through this pain
And I wonder 
If I'll ever be the same
God only knows
