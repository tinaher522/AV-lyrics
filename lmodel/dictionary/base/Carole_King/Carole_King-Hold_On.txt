<song artist="Carole_King" title="Hold_On">
Heavy chains have been broken
The old ones have spoken
Old young friend of ours
It won't be long until we can touch the stars
Like a quicksilver flash, your liquid light
Flows into our hearts and makes us feel allright
Hold on until we can get there
You know when we get there
All the dark forces will be gone
We need each other now more than ever
Our love is the sun--young lord of the light
It's a shame that one such as you
Should have to walk this cold and lonely night
Hold on until we can get there
You know when we get there
All the dark forces will be gone
