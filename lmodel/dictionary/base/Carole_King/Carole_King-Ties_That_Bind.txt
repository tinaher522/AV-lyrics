<song artist="Carole_King" title="Ties_That_Bind">
Once I heard long, long ago
That love's so hard to find
But if you got it, don't let go
All the ties that bind
The times when I can hold you
In my heart and in my mind
Are the times when I can really know you
And leave the rest behind
Go on and make believe if you want to
It's a real good sign
And stay with me if you like to
Come on, put your hand in mine
Down on the sidewalk, out on the street
Needing a connecting line
You tie up with some other people you meet
And the day begins to shine
All the ties that bind
The day begins to shine
In my heart and in my mind
All the ties that bind
All the ties
The ties that bind
