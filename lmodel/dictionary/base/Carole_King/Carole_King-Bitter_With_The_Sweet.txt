BITTER WITH THE SWEET
by Carole King
SOmetimes I'm tired and I wonder
what's so all-fired important
About being someplace at some time
Oh, but I don't really mind
Cause I could be on Easy Street
and I know that
You've got to take the bitter with the sweet
I guess it gets to everyone,
you think you're not having fun
And you wonder what you're doing
playing the games you play
Hey, well, it's true what they say
If ou want to feel complete
don't you know that
You've got to take the bitter with the sweet
A friend of mine once told me
And I know he knows all about feelin' down
He said everything good in life
you've got to pay for
But feelin' good is waht you're
paving the way for
So, don't let it get you down, my friend
though it seems the blues will never end
On this you can depend, they always do
And I can tell you that it's true
it's a feeling that can't be beat
And you've got to do it
You've got to take the bitter with the sweet
