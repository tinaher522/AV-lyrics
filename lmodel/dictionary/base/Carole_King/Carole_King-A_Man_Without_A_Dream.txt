<song artist="Carole_King" title="A_Man_Without_A_Dream">
With the music of life
My soul is out of tune
And I feel like I'm growing old
Much too soon
My love I just couldn't compare
And the key to my happiness
I let slip away
Now I'm a man without a dream
I've got a heart that has no home
All my senses are numb
Losing you I've become
A man without a dream
Instead of striving to reach my goals in life
I got distracted with mean, endless games
For just an illusion I traded love that was real
Now my eyes cannot see and my heart cannot feel
Now I'm a man without a dream
I've got a heart that has no home
All my senses are numb
Losing you I've become
A man without a dream
Sometimes I think I'm a prisoner of fate
Doomed to find out things a little too late
And so I must play this broken man's role
Unless you come home, girl
And bring back my soul
Now I'm a man without a dream
I've got a heart that has no home
All my senses are numb
Losing you I've become
A man without a dream
