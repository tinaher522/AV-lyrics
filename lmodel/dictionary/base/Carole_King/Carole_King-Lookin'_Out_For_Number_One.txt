<song artist="Carole_King" title="Lookin'_Out_For_Number_One">
What kind of fool do you think I am
To believe you really give a damn
You're just lookin' out for number one
You wanna win, no way you're gonna lose
Between me and you, which one will you choose
I know you're lookin' out for number one
Just look behind the silver screen you've built around yourself
You will find you're just the same as anybody else
And that's allright
What kind of fool are you gonna be
There's a locked-up soul and you hold the key
But you're too busy lookin' out for number one
What will you do, will you go through the day
Only half alive, who are you anyway
Just lookin' out for number one
What kind of chance are you willing to take
Are you willing to give just a little bit for your own sake
That's really lookin' out for number one
Really lookin' out for number one
Lookin' out for number one
