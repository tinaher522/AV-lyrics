MAIN STREET, SATURDAY NIGHT
by Carole King
See them drivin' by
Look at them fancy wheels
Headlights winkin' 
checkin' each other out
the Great American Pastime
is still the automobile
Cruisin' on the white line
Is the only way to make time
Down on Main Street, Saturday night
Eevrybody thinks they're so cool
On Main Street Saturday night
Don't you mess with him (her), Daddy,
he's (she's) nobody's fool
Look at the blonde beauties,
givin' all they got
Maybe if you hit on one,
you might luck out
Soem of them are foxy
some of them are not
But all of them will get down
If the right thing comes around
Here comes Little Willie
higher than a kite
He's been doin' some 
heavy duty hangin' out
If Willie's got a line on 
some of the best
It's got to be dynamite
You know you can trust him
If the Law don't bust him
