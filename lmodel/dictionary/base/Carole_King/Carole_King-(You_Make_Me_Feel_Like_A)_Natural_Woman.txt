<song artist="Carole_King" title="(You_Make_Me_Feel_Like_A)_Natural_Woman">
Looking out on the morning rain
I used to feel uninspired
And when I knew I had to face another day
Lord, it made me feel so tired
Before the day I met you, life was so unkind
but your love was the key to my peace of mind
cause you make me feel
you make me feel
you make me feel
like a natural woman
And when my soul was in the lost-and-found
You came along to claim it
I didn't know just what was wrong with me
till your kiss helped me name it
now I'm no longer doubtful
of what I'm living for
cause if I make you happy I don't need to do more
you make me feel
you make me feel
you make me feel
like a natural woman
oh baby what you've done to me (what you've done to me)
you make me feel so good inside (good inside)
and I just wanna be (wanna be)
close to you you make me feel so alive
you make me feel
you make me feel
you make me feel
like a natural, natural woman
you make me feel
you know you make me feel
you make me feel
like a natural woman
you know you
you make me feel
you make me feel
you make me feel
like a natural woman
natural woman
