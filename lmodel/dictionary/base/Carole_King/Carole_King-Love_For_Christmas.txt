<song artist="Carole_King" title="Love_For_Christmas">
I love you and it's Christmas
And I don't know what to do
'Cause there's so much that you dream of
That I can't give to you
It makes me sad to think of you
Going without this year
While others all around you
Celebrate with Christmas cheer
There is so much that you wish for
That I wish that I could buy
If only I could be the one
To fill your stocking high
I wanna give you everything
But all that I can do
Is give you love for Christmas
To last the whole year through
Maybe next year with a miracle
I can give you more
But no matter what, I'll be with you
Of that you can be sure
I'm so grateful for the small things
Every Christmas card I read
In the morning when I see you smile
You're all the gift I need
I wanna give you everything
But all that I can give
Is give you love for Christmas
I will give you love for Christmas
I will give you love for Christmas
That will last the whole year through
