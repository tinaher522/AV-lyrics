<song artist="Carole_King" title="Screaming_And_Yelling">
When everybody
Screams and yells
Who calms them down?
Who rings their bells?
When everybody screams and yells 
The enchanted one
That's me
When everybody screams and yells,
There's nothing to do!
There's nothing to see!
Who dreams up a place they'd like to be?
The enchanted one
That's me 
It takes personality
A lot of personality
To make them see it my way
It takes personality
More personality
To turn twelve boring hours
Into a fascinating day!
I CAN DO IT!
That's a fact
I CAN DO IT!
Don't you see?
AND I'LL DO IT
ALL FOR FREE!
Do you know? 
Can you guess
Who I simply have to be?
STOP SCREAMING AND YELLING
SCREAMING AND YELLING
SCREAMING AND YELLING
SCREAMING AND YELLING
AND I'LL TELL YOU ALREADY!
The enchanted one
That's me
