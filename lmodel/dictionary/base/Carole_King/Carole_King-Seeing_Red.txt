<song artist="Carole_King" title="Seeing_Red">
Since a time before my memory
He's been without a home
Once he lived on an open plain where wildlife grazed
And buffalo used to roam
Red was the sunrise on the dawn of his creation
Now where is the road that will lead him to his destination
It took so little time to destroy a way of life
They served his people well
Gifts that they gave in all good faith
Have been misused and shot to hell
You who want wisdom, turn and face the four directions
For only those with one heart, fall under their protection
In the future of my days ahead
I want to see it right
We got to make it right
