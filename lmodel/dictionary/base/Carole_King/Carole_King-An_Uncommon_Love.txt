Words and Music by 
Carole King, Rob Hyman &amp; Rich Wayland 
Why do we isolate each other
All the walls we build between us
Make it so hard to be together
How can we tear at one another
When the thing we have in common
Is an uncommon love
Walls can fall, tears can mend
So why can't we reach across the line
And touch each other
Here on two sides of the truth
We've a middle ground in common
We have an uncommon love
Time can heal, hearts can mend
So why can't we reach across the line
And touch each other
When will we ever learn
That the thing we have in common
Is an uncommon love
We have an uncommon love
An uncommon love
