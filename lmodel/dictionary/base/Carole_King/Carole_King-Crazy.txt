<song artist="Carole_King" title="Crazy">
Y'get up every morning, see the same old face
Y'get in your car and drive it down to the same old place
Well, do you ever wonder what it's all about
Something they call freedom of choice
That you should not live without
Me, I'm feelin' lazy
And it's me that's on the line
I may be crazy
But I've been crazy for a long time
You take your action on weekends at a time
But you can make all week your own
If you set your mind
You see security in the chrome American dream
But I don't believe in livin' in the middle
With available extremes
Now there's many people see the truth in what I'm sayin'
But it's hard to make up your mind with a programmed brain
You who know better, but you're just gonna wait and see
Why don't you do it now, you may never get another 
Opportunity
