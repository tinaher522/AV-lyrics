<song artist="Carole_King" title="Hold_Out_For_Love">
Everybody's got a little child inside
Still looking for love
Everything we do is in search of it
Everything we say or think of
And every time we reach for somebody
We're reaching out for love
Everybody's looking for love
Everybody is looking for love
When someone says a kind word
It's music to your ears
Yet somewhere inside you're wondering
If you really deserve to let go of your fears
You want to make a connection, you're looking for a way
To escape the loneliness and the tears
That you've had for years
Everybody's looking for love
Everybody is looking for love
But you know you gotta
Hold out, don't settle for less
Hold out for the real thing, hold out for the real thing
Hold out, you deserve the best
Hold out for the real thing, hold out for the real thing
Hold out for love
Maybe you're looking for security
But without a doubt
You're gonna miss the love you wish you had
'Cause love is what life is all about
Well, if it don't feel right, then don't do it
If the night is dark, don't sell your soul to get through it
Listen to your heart, it'll tell you how to do it
Love will be worth the wait
Everybody's looking for love
Everybody is looking for love
But you know you gotta
Hold out, don't settle for less
Hold out for the real thing, hold out for the real thing
Hold out, you deserve the best
Hold out for the real thing, hold out for the real thing
Hold out for love
