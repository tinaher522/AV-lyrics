Happy Birthday
Celebrate your day in style
Happy Birthday
Tonight I want to see you smile
Your whole life is in front of you, you've only just begun
So Happy Birthday
The best is yet to come
Happy Birthday to you
The good things I could say about you are infinite
But I will only take a minute
To say the world is a better place with you in it
With you in it
Happy Birthday
You know just how to be
Happy Birthday
I'm glad you're you with me
To know you is to love you, to love you is to be blessed
So Happy Birthday
You deserve the best
Every time I ever reach out for you
You never let me down
Any time you're ever in need of a friend
I will always be around
Happy Birthday
You are everything that's good
You are everything that matters
I would give you the world if I could
You will always be a part of me and all that I go through
So Happy Birthday, dear friend
May all your dreams come true
Happy birthday to you
