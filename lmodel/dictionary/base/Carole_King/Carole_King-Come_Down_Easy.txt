COME DOWN EASY
by Carole King &amp; Toni Stern
Daytime run away
Nightimes seem so long
I'm all right in the sunshine
But the evenings let me down
It sure is good to see you now
I'm really glad you came
And I would tell you what I need
But it never feels the same
So come down easy
Let it come down slow
I've been alone so long
that I just don't know what to do
And I don't want to lose you
How my life slips away
How the time goes by
And I know I belong here
Yes, I know, though I don't know why
Riding along with a friend of mine
Got enough space, got enough time
Pieces of fruit and glasses of wine
And love comes in the summertime
And I don't want to lose you
God bless the children
God bless us all
We are the children of Paradise
On our own now since the fall
All the things that are worth having
Are never ours to keep
Still I can see today could be
A good time for you and me
If you come down easy...
