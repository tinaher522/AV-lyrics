<song artist="Carole_King" title="Pleasant_Valley_Sunday">
The local rock group down the street
Is trying hard to learn their song 
Serenade the weekend squire 
Who just came out to mow his lawn 
Another Pleasant Valley Sunday 
Charcoal burning everywhere 
Rows of houses that are all the same 
And no one seems to care 
See Mrs. Gray
She's proud today 
Because her roses are in bloom 
Mr. Green 
He's so serene
He's got a TV in every room 
Another Pleasant Valley Sunday 
Here in status symbol land 
Mothers complain about how hard life is 
And the kids just don't understand 
Creature comfort goals 
They only numb my soul and make it hard for me to see 
My thoughts all seem to stray to places far away 
I need a change of scenery 
Another Pleasant Valley Sunday 
Charcoal burning everywhere 
Another Pleasant Valley Sunday 
Here in status symbol land 
Another Pleasant Valley Sunday
