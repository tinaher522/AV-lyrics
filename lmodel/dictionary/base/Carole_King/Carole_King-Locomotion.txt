LOCOMOTION
by Gerry Goffin and Carole King
Everybody's doin' a brand new dance now
Come on baby do the locomotion
I know you'll get to like it if you give it a chance now
Come on baby do the locomotion
My little baby sister can do it with ease
It's easier than learning your ABC's
So come on, come on do the locomotion with me
You gotta swing your hips now
Come on baby jump up jump back
Oh well, I think you've got the knack
Now that you can do it let's make a chain now
Come on baby do the locomotion
Chug-a-chug a motion like a railroad train now
Come on baby do the locomotion
Do it nice and easy now and don't lose control
A little bit of rhythm and a lot of soul
Come on, come on do the locomotion with me
Move around the floor in a locomotion
Come on baby do the locomotion
Do it holdin' hands if you get the notion
Come on baby do the locomotion
There's never been a dance that's so easy to do
It even makes you happy when you're feeling blue
Come on, come on do the locomotion with me
