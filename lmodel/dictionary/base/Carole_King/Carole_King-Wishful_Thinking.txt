WISHFUL THINKING
by Carole King
I see you, but you don't see me
Like a ghost of the future hovering dark and dreamy
You fade in and out of the mist
Do you even exist, except in my wishful thinking
I reach for you, but I can't touch you
I feel you just beyond a star
Do you know how much you are all I ever wanted
Is it too much too soon
Am I foolishly dreaming
Just baying at the moon
Playing impossible visions like an elementary tune
How I wish that I could realize my heart
But it's only wishful thinking on my part.
