<song artist="Carole_King" title="Homeless_Heart">
The lantern moon hung high and gold
In the cold November sky
The locust sang a midnight song
And starlight wind was a sigh
And you moved me with no hand
Like the moon moves the sea
What I wouldn't give for the love that used to be
The icy roofs below me now
Shelter all the souls within
But oh, nothing shelters me 
From the thought of what could have been
Why does laughter remembered
Always lead me to tears
I've got the life I want, but I don't have what I need
Homeless heart
Why do you do this to yourself
Homeless heart
You ought to leave the dust on the shelf
Homeless heart
There must be someone else in the dark
With a homeless, homeless, homeless heart
I ache in a place so deep
I can't hide, even in my sleep
Slow torture
If you walked in on me right now
I'd love you so hard
You'd wonder how
You let me go
Why did you let me go
The telephone, just sitting there
Brings your number to my mind
Another piece of yesterday
That I should be leaving behind
Will I make it to the morning
Without hearing your voice
Or will I surrender to my
Homeless heart
Why do you do this to yourself
Homeless heart
You ought to leave the dust on the shelf
Homeless heart
There must be someone else in the dark
With a homeless, homeless, homeless heart
