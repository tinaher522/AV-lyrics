<song artist="Carole_King" title="Really_Rosie_(Reprise)">
I'm really Rosie
And I'm Rosie Real
You better believe me
I'm a great big deal!
BELIEVE ME!
I'm a star from afar
Off the golden coast
Beat the drum! Make that toast!
To Rosie the Most!
BELIEVE ME!
I can sing
Tea for Two and Two for Tea
I can act
To be or not to be
I can tap
Across the Tappan Zee
Hey, can't you see?
I'm terrific at everything!
No star shines so bright as me--Rosie!
BELIEVE ME!
I'm Really Rosie
I'm Rosie Real
I'm Really Rosie
BELIEVE ME!
