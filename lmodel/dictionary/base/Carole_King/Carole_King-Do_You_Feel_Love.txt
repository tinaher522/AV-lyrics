<song artist="Carole_King" title="Do_You_Feel_Love">
She lives in the land of the used to be
These days, baby that's all she's got 
She tries so hard just to stay in touch
But auld acquaintance long forgot
A half cup of coffee steaming in her hand
Too bad things didn't turn out quite the way she planned
She had hold of the brass ring but it came back sand
And broken promises
Do you feel love
Do you feel love tonight
Do you feel love
Do you feel love tonight
Yesterday I ran into an old friend
Standing on a corner in a cold sweat
So I took him walking down on Deal Street
To make a payment on a years-old debt
He told me what he's feeling; I told him all I know
He told me all about the fear when the night winds blow
Hey you don't need to hold on to wrongs of long ago
And broken promises
Do you feel love
Do you feel love tonight
Do you feel love
Do you feel love tonight
Do you feel love
Do you feel love tonight
You write your life story in your dreams at night
And hope your life turns out that way
In your racy lacy underwear you long for love
But love eludes you every day
All the old suspicions well up in your mind
You always look for trouble, so trouble's what you find
But you got the power to get out of the line
Of broken promises
Y'got to get out, get out, get out of the line
Do you feel love
Do you feel love tonight
Do you feel love, 
Do you feel love tonight
