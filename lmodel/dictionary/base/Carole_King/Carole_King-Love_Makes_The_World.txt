<song artist="Carole_King" title="Love_Makes_The_World">
There was trouble in my mind tonight
Something inside didn't feel quite right
Then I saw your face in the moonlight and I was right beside you
Don't need words that we used to use
It goes deeper then the words we choose
You cant loose I wanna spread the news u got a love inside you
Some days it's hard to know what your feeling
I've been down that road before
I can't stop believing
Love makes the world go round
As long as your a part of me
Nothing's gonna take me down
Ohhh
Last winter when the snow fall hit
Cold city it was hard to commit
You were out there looking for the perfect fit and I was right beside you
Nothing real comes over night
You weren't sure if it felt right
But sometimes a love can move your life if you let it guide you
Baby you've got to take love where you can find it
Just walk right through that door
I can't stop believing
Love makes the world go round
As long as I'm a part of you nothing's gonna take you down
Love makes the world
Can't stop believing
Gonna make it happen together
We are strong now
Watch us fly
I can't stop believing
Love makes the world go round
As long as your a part of me nothing's gonna take me down
Love makes the world
Can't stop believing
