<song artist="Carole_King" title="Snow_Queen">
High on a snow covered mountain
From her throne she looks down at the clowns
Who think youth can be found in a fountain
High on the wings of her rhythms
She will smile at the guys who come on with their eyes
But she'll never dance with them
And in smoke filled rooms of electric sound
A legend is built around... The Snow Queen
You may believe you're a winner
But with her you'll soon bite the dust
And discover you're just a beginner
You may not think you're a loser
But in mid-air you'll be hung while 
You trip on your tongue
And it'll only amuse her
In the morning haze you are frozen there
Caught in the icy stare of  The Snow Queen
No my friend she doesn't want what you're selling
Oh, my friend there must be a place you can hide
And into the night you'll fade knowing you lost the game
And that's just how she got her name of The Snow Queen
