<song artist="Carole_King" title="No_Easy_Way_Down">
Your toy balloon has sailed in the sky
But now it must fall to the ground
Now your sad eyes reveal
Just how badly you feel
'Cause there is no easy way down
The view from the cliffs must have been exciting
And up to the peaks you were bound
Now you're stranded alone
And the path is unknown
And there is no easy way down
No, it isn't very easy
When you're left on your own
No, it isn't very easy
When each road you take
Is one more mistake
And there's no one to break your fall
And lead you back home
We all like to climb to the heights, I know
Where our fantasy world can be found
But you must know in the end
When it's time to descend
There is no easy way down
You know you're gonna find
There is no easy way down
