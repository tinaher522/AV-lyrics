<song artist="Carole_King" title="Disappointed">
If I think I'm gonna have a chocolate sundae
But it's Sunday
And when I get to the door of the ice cream store
It says closed
Sitting down on the sidewalk
I feel like I'm gonna cry
You can call me silly but I don't think I am
And here's why
I'm disappointed disappointed
I didn't get what I wanted
I might get over it someday
But for now I think I'll stay
Disappointed that's all
Shelly's coming over for a play date and I can't wait
But just before the doorbell rings
The telephone does and it brings
The bad news
Shelly's mom says she's not coming
She's come down with the flu
We were gonna have some fun but now there's
Nothing to do
I'm disappointed
I didn't get what I wanted
I might get over it someday
But for now I think I'll stay
Disappointed that's all
Woke up yesterday and it was snowing
I won't be going
I lay in bed and realized I was a little bit surprised
It felt good
Because the place that I was going
Wasn't circus it was school
Instead of being angry I was happy I was cool
Not disappointed
This time I got what I wanted
I didn't know it at first
Then I jumped up with a burst
Not disappointed that's all
