THERE'S A SPACE BETWEEN US
by Carole King
Everytime I've needed you
You've been there for me
But now I feel a boundary has been drawn
I can see from all you do
That you still care for me
I know the feeling hasn't gone
But there's a space between us
A place that I can't go
Unless you step across and meet me halfway
We've been friends for much too long
And the feeling's much too strong 
to let it go astray
Reach out and make the space between us go away
I know a little bit of space between two friends
CAn sometimes do them good
But once in a while we need to touch
The way that people should
Love can tie you down, I know
Cause you know I've been there
But I've been working on a way to love
And still be free to care
You love your lady
And I know just what you're thinking
Was a time I used to be just where you are
But since I've found my freedom
And I've finally let it sink in
The distance isn't very far
There's a space between us
A place that I can't go
Unless you step across and meet me halfway
We've been friends for much too long
And the feeling's much too strong
to elt it go astray
Reach out and make the space between us go away
Reach out, I know that you can hear me
Come on and reach out, I need to feel you near me
