<song artist="Carole_King" title="Eagle">
Eagle wants to fly again
Though she's been shot down
You can see her tryin'
Though her wings still touch the ground
Soon she's gonna rise up
With a pure and joyful sound
Fly, Eagle
Strong heart feels abandoned
He's been away from what he loves the best
But his spirit isn't broken
He feels content around the Eagle's nest
Ah, but you can feel his patience
And you know whatever strong heart does
He never longs for what was
He lives each moment to the end
Eagle wants to fly again
Though she's been shot down
You can see her tryin'
Though her wings still touch the ground
Soon she's gonna rise up
With a pure and joyful sound
Fly, Eagle
Through it all she tends her young ones
Doing what she can to help them grow
Maybe they will fly away before her
And her only choice is just to let them go
Eagle sees her sister
Living free up on the mountain top
So she doubles her effort
Till you think that she is bound to drop
But Eagle has the courage
You can tell that she's been felled before
She was born to soar
And she's gonna soar again
