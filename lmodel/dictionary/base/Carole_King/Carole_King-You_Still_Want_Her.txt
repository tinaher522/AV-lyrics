YOU STILL WANT HER
by Carole King
From the shelter of your solitude you see her
Running circles round the emptiness within
And you wonder what it's been like to be her
As you feel yourself awakening
Though she fills her life between with new adventure
There's confusion in her eyes each time you meet
You don't think she's gonna last another winter
With all the snow she's rakin' in
CHORUS:
You can't believe you still want her
After all these years of knowing her so well
ALl the same you'd willingly consign yourself
To a life of hell
You would think by now you'de see it in perspective
She's too insecure to ever really change
You've convinced yourself this time you'll be objective
You won't need any breakin' in
There's no reason to believe it will be different
She's still playing games and running from herself
But you've always thought you love for her could save her
And that's how you get taken in
CHORUS
