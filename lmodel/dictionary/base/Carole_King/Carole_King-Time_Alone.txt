TIME ALONE
by Carole King
here we are in time alone
No one else's feelings but our own
Seems to me that we have always known
What love was meant to be
Separately we stood before
Life was good but we knew there should
be more
Time alone could open up the door
And you came through for me
No sign of the changes we have come through
No mind of the strangers who think they
know you
Now as one we are the a light
Though sometimes we were blinded by the night
Here in time alone it all seems right
And I'm feeling wholly free
Won't you stay in time alone with me
