FEELING SAD TONIGHT
by Carole King &amp; Toni Stern
Feeling sad tonight
But everything's all right
And we'll find some other place to go
Feeling sad tonight
But everyhting's all right
Let's turn all our cares down low.
Come on, let's go downtown
It's like a trip back to the past
Running down the bright night
Drivind a little too fast
Oh, I'm counting on you
Sitting on a barstool
I'm a fool
Always feeling half right and half safe
Halfway dreaming of some safe place
away from school
Oh, I'm counting on you
Silly someitmes
I'm a fool.
Feeling sad tonight
But everything's all right
And we'll find some other place to go
Feeling sad tonight
But everyhting's all right
Let's turn all our cares down low.
There is a sapce between us 
Which we cross
To touch each other softly
And so make up our loss
Some things take so long to learn
No matter how we try
Still we try and keep it open
And we get by
Feeling sad tonight
But everything's all right
And we'll find some other place to go
Feeling sad tonight
Feeling sad
Feeling so sad tonight
