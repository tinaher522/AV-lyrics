<song artist="Carole_King" title="Avenue_P">
In dreams, it seems I always see
Avenue P as it ought to be 
In a four-star movie directed by me
And starring, of course, yours truly
Rosie
In this fabulous movie you're all gonna see
An entirely different Avenue P
Imagine me in a jungle gown
And Avenue P a jungle town
With King Kong swinging out of a tree
And carrying me over that jungly Avenue P
Right
You don't have to sit with your face in a droop on the stoop
'Cause your mama the boss says you better not cross that old Avenue P
In a jungle you are free, ta-dah
The tom-tom beats, the tiger carouses
The jungle creeps over the red brick houses
And for chillers and thrillers, I train giant gorillas
To chase mamas and papas, clippety-cloppety
Thumping their breasts and roaring, "Get off of my property"
No one's allowed who says "maybe" or "no"
They gotta get out, they just gotta go
Right
In dreams, it seems I always see
Avenue P as it ought to be 
A terrific place for people like me, you'll see
I'll make it that way someday
Avenue P as it ought to be
Avenue P as it ought to be
Avenue P as it ought to be
Avenue P as it ought to be
Avenue P as it ought to be
Avenue P as it ought to be
