<song artist="Carole_King" title="Why_Are_You_Leaving">
You told me that you had to go
You said you could not stay here
That being here just made you sad
For sunshine, ships and easy land
And you miss the pretty things you had
So what am I to tell you
Why are you leaving 
Why are you leaving
And what's that secret sorrow that you're carrying
You said you were not born to win
But I don't think you mean it
That you think you'd better live alone
And gather people one by one
Oh, but when each new day is done
Will you turn and face my window
Why are you leaving 
Why are you leaving
And what's that secret sorrow that you're carrying
As the day begins to fade
Electric lamps, they trick you
Into seeing faces on the wall
Old memories that you recall
And you're afraid you'll lose them all
And the promises they made you
Why are you leaving 
Why are you leaving
And what's that secret sorrow that you're carrying
Why are you leaving 
Why are you leaving
Why are you leaving
Why are you leaving
Why are you leaving
Why are you leaving
