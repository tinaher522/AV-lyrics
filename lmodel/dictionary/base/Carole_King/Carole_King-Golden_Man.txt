<song artist="Carole_King" title="Golden_Man">
Golden man
You hold my heart in your hand
You made me understand
The pain the earth is feeling
You know what love is worth
You're real, and you know 
Your purpose on earth
And I can see the sun
Shining in your eyes
Golden man
Beneath the crescent moon you stand
You speak to the wind and
Unmistakably it answers
And just like two dancers
We move together 
In perfect harmony
And I can see the sun
Shining in your eyes
Son, lover, brother
Father and friend
From the mountain
You've come down
You wrap your love around me
And I know my soul has found me
By the way we blend again and again 
And again
Golden man
My now and forever's planned
The land is our destiny and
You have brought me home to it
Together we'll build our dream
I know that we can do it
'Cause I can see the sun
Shining in your eyes
