<song artist="Carole_King" title="Child_Of_Mine">
Although you see the world different than me
Sometimes I can touch upon the wonders that you see
And all the new colors and pictures you've designed
Oh yes, sweet darling, so glad you are a child of mine
Child of mine, child of mine
Oh yes, sweet darling
So glad you are a child of mine
You don't need directions, you know which way to go
And I don't want to hold you back, I just want to watch you grow
You're the one who taught me you don't have to look behind
Oh yes, sweet darling, so glad you are a child of mine
Child of mine, child of mine
Oh yes, sweet darling
So glad you are a child of mine
Nobody's gonna kill your dreams or tell you how to live your life
There'll always be people who make it hard for a while
But you'll change their heads when they see you smile
The times you were born in may not have been the best
But you can make the times to come better than the rest
I know you will be honest if you can't always be kind
Oh yes, sweet darling, so glad you are a child of mine
