<song artist="Carole_King" title="Everyday_Will_Be_Like_A_Holiday">
Every day will be like a holiday with my baby
When my baby comes home
She's been alone such a long time
Christmas is coming, I've got her on my mind
I bought a present today, some sweet perfume
I'll wait for my baby, you know she'll be home soon
Every day will be like a holiday with my baby
When my baby comes home
I'm never worried, I never sit by the phone
'Cause come Christmas time I'll never be alone
See everybody on this holiday
I know this feeling somewhere never gonna go away
Every day will be like a holiday with my baby
When my baby comes home
