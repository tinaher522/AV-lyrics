<song artist="Carole_King" title="So_Goes_Love">
Girl, this is goodbye for us
I'm afraid there's no two ways about it
Now you say you need my love
But you'll just have to learn to live without it
So goes love
Don't try to understand it
So goes love
It never works the way you planned it
When you meant the world to me
That's the time you said you didn't want me
You played around in front of me
You did everything you could to taunt me
So goes love
Don't try to analyze it
So goes love
And when it dies you can't disguise it
It's been said
You've made your bed and now you'll have to lie in it
There's no denying it's a shame
But there's really no one else that you can blame
So goes love
Don't try to understand it
So goes love
It never works the way you planned it
