<song artist="Carole_King" title="Simple_Things">
Simple things mean a lot to me
Some things only children can see
Simple things like horses running free
And easy acceptance of life
Simple things never compromise
All things have a rhythm I can't realize
I feel content in my freedom
And I feel my freedom is right
I never want to stop being a child
I want to see the flowers growing wild on the hillside
To see the sun rise in the morning
Sunlight growing, filling the skies
Simple things of the earth don't die
They just grow and change as time goes by
There are no questions without answers
I've found my answer to life is living
The secret of living is life
