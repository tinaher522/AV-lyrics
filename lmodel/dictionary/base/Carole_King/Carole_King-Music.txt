<song artist="Carole_King" title="Music">
Music is playing inside my head
Over and over and over again
My friend, there's no end to the music...
Ah, summer is over
But the music keeps playing
And won't let the cold get me down.
MUSICAL PIECE
Pictures are forming inside my brain
Soon with the colors they'll rain together and grow
Then don't you know, don't you know there'll be music...
Ah, it's not always easy
But the music keeps playing
And won't let the world get me down.
Music is playing inside
Music is playing inside
Music is playing inside
Music, Music, Music
