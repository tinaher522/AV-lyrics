TOO MUCH RAIN
by Carole King and Toni Stern
If anyone asks you how I am
Just say I'm doin' fine
If you will do that for me
I'll do the same for you sometime
ANd if anyone asks you where I've gone
Just say I'm down the line
I don't want my friends to see me like this
Maybe some other time
Too much rain fallin'
Too much rain fallin'
There's just been too much rain down on me
One day I'm gonna understand
The way that my heart works
And then I'm gonna work it out
ASO that I won't get hurt
But if anyone asks you where I've gone
Oh, don't say where I am
Just say you saw me and I'm doin' fine
Cause I'm doin' the best I can
Too much rain fallin'
Too much rain fallin'
There's just been too much rain fallin' down on me
