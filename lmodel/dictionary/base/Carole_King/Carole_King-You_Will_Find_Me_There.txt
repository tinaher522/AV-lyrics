Words and Music by 
Carole King (Based on a track by Allstar &amp; Joel Campbell) 
You don't have to wear the weight of the 
world on your shoulders
Don't you know I'll be there for you, always, always
You can tell me anything, and you know I'll understand
When you're down and out, and your soul is bare
You just turn around - you will find me there
You keep on giving everyone 
so much more than your share
So many things you do in so many ways, always
But you need someone you can hold on to
When you're down and out, I will always care
You just turn around - you will find me there
When it's all gone wrong, it's falling down on you
Lean on me, I'll be strong
I will keep you safe, keep you warm
When you're down and out, I will always care
You just turn around - you will find me there
I will take your hand, I will dry your tears
I will comfort you when your hope has disappeared
When you're down and out, I will always care
You just turn around - you will find me right there
When you're down and out and you're in despair
You just turn around - you will find me there
When you're down and out, I will be right there
You just turn around, you will find me
You will find me there
