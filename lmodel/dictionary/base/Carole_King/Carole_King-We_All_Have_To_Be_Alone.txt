WE ALL HAVE TO BE ALONE
by Gerry Goffin &amp; Carole King
Once I told you without feeling
When you came to me in sorrow
There's a truth that life's revealing
We all have to be alone
You only wanted someone tohold you
Tell you she'd be there tomorrow
But instead I only told you
We all have to be alone
Then I was amazed to see
How quickly you agreed with me
If that's the way it has to be
There's nothing left to say
No reason left to stay
Besides I've got a lot of better things
to do today
So my world grew so much colder
With a little love to lend or borrow
And I found out as I grew older
We all have to be alone
