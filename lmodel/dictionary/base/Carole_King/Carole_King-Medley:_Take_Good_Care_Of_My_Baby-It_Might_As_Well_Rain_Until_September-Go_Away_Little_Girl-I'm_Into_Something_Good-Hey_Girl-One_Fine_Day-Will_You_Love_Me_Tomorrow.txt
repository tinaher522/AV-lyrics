My tears are fallin' 'cause you've taken her away
And though it really hurts me so
There's something that I've gotta say
Take good care of my ba-a-a-by
Be just as kind as you can be-e-e-e
And if you should discover
That you don't really love her
Just send my baby back home to me

The weather here has been as nice as it can be
Although it doesn't really matter much to me
For all the fun I'll have while you're so far away
It might as well rain until September
September
September
Oh, it might as well rain until September

Oh, go away, little girl. Go away, little girl.
It's hurtin' me more each minute that you delay.
When you are near me like this,
You're much too hard to resist.
So, go away, little girl, before I beg you to stay."

Woke up this mornin' feelin' fine
There's somethin' special on my mind
Last night I met a new boy in the neighbourhood, whoa yeah
Somethin' tells me I'm into something good
Somethin' tells me I'm into something good

Hey girl now sit yourself down
I'm not ashamed to get down on the ground
And then beg you to stay
Don't go away, Hey Girl
I beg you please don't go away 
Hey girl 

One fine day, you'll look at me
And you will know our love was meant to be
One fine day, you're gonna want me for your girl
One fine day, oh
One fine day, you're gonna want me for your girl

Tonight you're mine
Completely
You give your love
So sweetly
Tonight the light
Of love is in your eyes
But will you love me tomorrow?
Tonight with words
Unspoken
You say that I'm the only one
But will my heart
Be broken
When the night
Meets the morning sun
I'd like to know
That your love
Is love I can
Be sure of
So tell me now
And I won't ask again
Will you still love me tomorrow?
Will you still love me tomorrow?
Will you still love me tomorrow?
Will you still love me tomorrow?
