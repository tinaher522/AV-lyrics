SONG OF LONG AGO
by Carole King
Whispering wind came uninvited
Looking for somewhere else to go
Here is a lamp I've left unlighted
Aren't you someone I should know?
Memory's flame is soon ignited
Lighting my lamp with amber glow
Quietly friends are reunited
Singing a song of long ago, la la la...
Cry, cry for someone
Who just can't be happy
And be glad you can feel enough to cry
Younger than always, time descended
Bringing me brand new seeds to sow
Now that they've been a long time planted
What must I do to help them grow?
If it had been as I intended
I wouldn't have the peace I know
Loving the people I've befriended
Singin' a song of long ago, la la la...
As it began, so I will end it
Singing a song of long ago
Loving the people I've befriended
And singin' a song of long, long, long ago
