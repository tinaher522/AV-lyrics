<song artist="Carole_King" title="Peace_In_The_Valley">
Looking out my window
Peace in the valley just don't come
Though I know that man's my brother
ANd that I'm the sefish one.
The hour is getting later
It's time we had begun
Knowing something's one thing
But the race must still be run
Take care of little jealousies
And talk that kills for fun
And hold your heart in readiness
It's so easy to come undone
But I think I saw a brand new light
Coming over the horizon
Brighter than all the others 
And it says all men are brothers under the skin
Brothers under the skin
Looking out my window
Peace in the valley just don't come
Though I know that she's my siter
And that I'm the selfish one
And I look at other people
And I love the ones I can
And I wonder if the dreamm will be
Or turned into sand
Still I think I saw a brand new light
Coming over the horizon
Brighter than all the others 
And it says all men are brothers under the skin
Brothers under the skin
Peace in the valley just don't come
