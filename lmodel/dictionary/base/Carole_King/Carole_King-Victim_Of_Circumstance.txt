<song artist="Carole_King" title="Victim_Of_Circumstance">
Out in the woods and I'm lost again
Stranded in the wilderness with no sense of direction
I do have a prayer but I don't stand a chance
Oh, I'm just a victim of circumstance
Down in the swamp I'm stuck in the sand
Thinking while I'm sinking there must be some connection
I'll twist the future lock but in the final trance
Oh, I'm just the victim of circumstance
Oh, I am a simple soul
Who takes the role for granted
But people go and lose control
And try to take advantage
Out on the street with my doubts and my plan
I've thought it through and I've come to one conclusion
I'll make the best of everything and leave the rest to chance
Oh, I'm just a victim of circumstance
