<song artist="Carole_King" title="To_Know_That_I_Love_You">
The winds of time set my mind at ease
Like a gentle breeze, they let me know that I love you
Over and over again, we light the flame
Re-discovering that we are the same and I love you
Ah--it feels so good to know that I love you
With each new morning it's a good feeling to know
There is something to look forward to these days
As time sets in, we still begin to know each other
Even now as we go our separate ways
Ever together
Like the sun and the moon we give each other room
To shine and to glow and to grow and I know that I love you
Ah--it feels so good to know that I love you
