Words and Music by 
Carole King 
Seems so hard
All I want to do is let down my guard
Laugh like a child and play out in the yard
I want to feel safe again
I don't know
What happened to you, where did you go
Wish I could not feel the cold wind blow
I want to feel safe again
If only I could believe everything will soon be
like all the fairy tales I've read
But I feel so lost and naked
And I wake up with the shape of a dream
In my head
Seems so hard
All I want to do is let down my guard
Get through just one more day unscarred
I want to feel safe again
I want to feel safe again
Safe again with you
