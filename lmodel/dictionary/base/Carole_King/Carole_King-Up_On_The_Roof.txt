<song artist="Carole_King" title="Up_On_The_Roof">
When this old world starts getting me down
And people are just too much for me to face
I climb way up to the top of the stairs
And all my cares just drift right into space
On the roof it's peaceful as can be
And there the world below can't bother me
Let me tell you now
When I come home feelin' tired and beat
I go up where the air is fresh and sweet
I get away from the hustling crowds 
And all that rat race noise down in the street
Up on the roof
On the roof's the only place I know 
Where you just have to wish to make it so
Oh, let's go up on the roof
At night the stars put on a show for free
And darling, you can share it all with me
I keep a-telling you 
Right smack dab in the middle of town 
I found a paradise that's trouble-proof
Up on the roof
So if this world starts getting you down
There's room enough for two, up on the roof
Up on the roof, everything is allright
Up on the roof, oh, come on, baby 
Up on the roof 
Up on the roof
