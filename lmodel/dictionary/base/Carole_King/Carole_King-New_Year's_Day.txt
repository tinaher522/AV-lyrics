<song artist="Carole_King" title="New_Year's_Day">
Everybody makes a dream this time of year
From now on it's gonna be good for you
All your friends and family
Gather 'round in peace and harmony
It's a time to remember your blessings
It's a time to remember your goals
All the people in your life
Be they new friends or old
And it could be the time of your life
Everything's gonna turn out alright
It'll be okay, in every way makin' it better
It's New Year's Day
And should auld acquaintance be forgot
Keep everything they gave you
An' though they may seem so far away
You walk with them each and everyday
And I know sometimes the road isn't easy
And we've said something we'd never wished to say
Once a few rounds you loved and lost
You pick yourself up and take a chance again
And it could be the time of your life
Everything's gonna turn out alright
It'll be okay, in every way makin' it better
It's New Year's Day
Countdown's dawn
And we'll sway along with the band
Just one more dance
May all your dreams come true
And it could be the time of your life
Everything's gonna turn out alright
It'll be okay, in every way makin' it better
It's New Year's Day
New Year's Day
