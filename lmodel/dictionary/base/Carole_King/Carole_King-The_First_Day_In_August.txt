THE FIRTS DAY IN AUGUST
by Carole King &amp; Charles Larkey
On the first day in August
I want to wake up by your side
After sleeping with you
on the last night in July
In the morning
We'll catch the sun rising
And we'll chase it from the mountains
to the bottom of the sea
When the day is over
ANd the night air comes to chill us
You'll build a fire
And we'll watch the flames dancing
You'll fall asleep
With your arm around my shoulder
And nothing will come between us
On the first night In August
The first day In August
