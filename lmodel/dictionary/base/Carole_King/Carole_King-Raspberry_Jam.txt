<song artist="Carole_King" title="Raspberry_Jam">
Pieces of toast 
Raspberry jam
Laid out on the breakfast table
It's time to begin again
Way down in the valley
Where the rivers flow
Lives a girl named Sally
Who loves to watch things grow
Pieces of toast 
Raspberry jam
Laid out on the breakfast table
It's time to begin again
Now Sally has five children
And a good old man
And they all sit down together
For their toast and
Their raspberry jam
Oh, how they love 
Pieces of toast 
Raspberry jam
Laid out on the breakfast table
It's time to begin again
Doo, doo, doo...
