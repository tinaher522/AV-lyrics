STILL HERE THINKING OF YOU
by Gerry Goffin &amp; Carole King
I ahve tried to untangled
All my thoughs from every angle
To know the one I loved the best
To dream of happiness and make that 
dream come true
And I'm still here thinking of you
Yes I'm still here thinking of you
The city streets are colder
And I'm jsut a little bit older
My love has grown somehow
I can feel it now much more
than you ever knew
And I'm still here thinking of you
Yes I'm still here thinking of you
This road keeps winding
And I wake up finding
Somehow I've lost my way again
Someway I'd like to get through
SOmeday I'd like to get to
The road that's straight beyond the bend
I have tried to unravel
The paths we've both had to travel
And now that I have come to see
How much you meant to me
We might get to see a better view
Yes,I'm still here thinking of you
Still here thinking of you
I'm still here thinking of you
Yes I'm still here thinking of you
