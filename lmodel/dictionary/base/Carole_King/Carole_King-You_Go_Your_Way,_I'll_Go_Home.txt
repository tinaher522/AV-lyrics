<song artist="Carole_King" title="You_Go_Your_Way,_I'll_Go_Home">
You've put these distances between us
You've built these walls, they're your design
With sharp and angry lies, you've cut the binding ties
While making love seem so unkind
Well, all right, you go your way, I'll go mine
I'll get over you in time
There's nothing here to hold you now
Oh, It's your life, so make it shine
You go your way, I'll go mine
I've tried to justify your thinking
I've given in and been denied
Like a hundred times before, you take
And ask for more
The only thing you leave is compromise
Well, all right, you go your way, I'll go mine
I'll get over you in time
There's nothing here to hold you now
We left those dreams so far behind
You go your way, I'll go mine
Oh, there's no need for false amending
Things get so confusing when you do
When love's become a loss, we spend our
Nights defending
I feel so damn defeated when we're through
But all right, you go your way, I'll go mine
I'll get over you in time
There's nothing here to hold you now
I just can't fight your willful mind
You go your way, I'll go mine
