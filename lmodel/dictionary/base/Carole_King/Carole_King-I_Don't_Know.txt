<song artist="Carole_King" title="I_Don't_Know">
Words and Music by 
Carole King, Gary Burr, Paul Brady &amp; Mark Hudson 
I don't know if it's hot in Texas
And I don't know if it's cold in Hell
I don't know if God is watching
I just know that I love you
People say "bad man's gonna getcha"
Trade my shoes for a simple soul
Throw away your burnt sienna
Cause I just know that I love you
Sticks and stones get gone in a hurry
Jack say "Jill, you never looked so fine"
Dancing on Boardwalk, what me worry?
As long as I know you're mine, all mine 
all mine, all mine
you're mine

[Chorus] 
I don't know, I don't know,
I don't know, I don't know
And if everybody had someone to care about
What a world, what a world
What a wonderful, wonderful world this would be
I don't care who's in the World Series
Or who does what in their own bedroom
News is blues and it doesn't really matter
I just know that, I just know that I love you
[Chorus]
I just know that I love you
