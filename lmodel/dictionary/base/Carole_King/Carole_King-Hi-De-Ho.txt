HI DE HO
by Gerry Goffin &amp; Carole King
Hi de ho, hi de hi
Gonna get me a piece of the sky
Gotta find me some o' that old sweet roll
A singin'
Hi de hi de hi de hi de ho
I've been down so long
Bottom looked like up
Once I thought that second saves
Was enough to fill my cup
Now I offered all I got
And that ain't no way to live
Bein' taken by the ones 
who got the least amount to give
(CHORUS)
Once I met the devil â€“ he was mighty slick
Tempted me with wordly goods
And said you could have your pick
But when he laid the paper on me
And he showed me where to sign
I said, "Thank you very kindly
but I'm in too great a need of mind."?
(CHORUS)
