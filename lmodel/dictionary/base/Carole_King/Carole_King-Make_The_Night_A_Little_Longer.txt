<song artist="Carole_King" title="Make_The_Night_A_Little_Longer">
My days are years 'cause I don't see my baby
Till the stars are in the sky
And every night when we can be together
Time just seems to hurry by
[Chorus]
So Lord I'm beggin' you to make the night (just a little longer)
Make the night (just a little longer)
So I can kiss him (just a little longer)
And hold him tight (just a little longer)
You made the world the way you thought it should be
So won't you make the night a little longer for me?
My nights are warm, 'cause when he hugs and holds me
Everything just feels so fine
But Lord, you know, I hate to see the sunlight
Takes away that man of mine
[Chorus]
(Just a little longer, just a little longer)
[Chorus]
Then embrace his arms (just a little longer)
Capture all of his charms (just a little longer)
Please Lord, make the night
