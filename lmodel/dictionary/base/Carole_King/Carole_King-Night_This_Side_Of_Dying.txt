<song artist="Carole_King" title="Night_This_Side_Of_Dying">
I remember one young sister with rainbows in her eyes
Standing on the corner with the afternoon's supply
She spoke of other places, perhaps a better road
Then she asked if I could tell her where they
Kept the mother lode
Like a night this side of dying
Her day's inside the dropper on the shelf
When she hears her lifeline crying
Not a thing you say can stop her
When she just can't stop herself
I remember that July, the panic and the heat
The savage shine of summer, the strychnine in the street
The way they sold each other for a favor in glassine
The best of friends sold brothers for a
Dime of quinine dreams
Like a night this side of dying
Her day's inside the dropper on the shelf
Like the shelter she's been buying
Not a thing I've got can save her
When she just can't save herself
She just can't save herself
