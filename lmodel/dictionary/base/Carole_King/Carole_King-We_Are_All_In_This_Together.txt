WE ARE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER
by Carole King &amp; David Palmer
The just are seeking justice
The meek are reaching out
For something only children
Can really know about
And some men cry for mercy
While they deny their brothers' pain
And some men laugh for reasons
They can never quite explain
We are all in this together
And maybe we'll see that one day
When we conquer our fear together
When we finally find a way
And we all need forgiving
For all the damage done
For the things we do, not thinking
For the hurt that we've caused someone
But me, I keep on living
Caught soemwhere there between
The reason and the meaning
The vision and the dream
We are all in this together
I know that seems easy to say
But don't use the word "forever"
It's enough just to say "someday"
