<song artist="Carole_King" title="Good_Mountain_People">
I've seen people--just because they've had some schooling
Think they know all there is to know
Well, I've done some movin' around in my time and I ain't foolin'
One of my favorite places to go
Is where there's 
Good mountain people who make y' feel so fine
Good mountain people--they sure know how to have a rockin' good time
I've traveled in vehicles over miles of country
Too fast to stop and look around
But I'm like a child again, I'm learnin' how to run free
It's good to feel my feet back on the ground
Livin' with those
Good mountain people who make y' feel so fine
Good mountain people--they sure know how to have a rockin' good time
It's quite a sight to see rednecks and longhairs
After years on the opposite sides of the fence
Helpin' each other in time of need, knowin' they both belong there
Working it out with good old common sense
Just because they're 
Good mountain people who make y' feel so fine
Good mountain people--they sure know how to have a rockin' good time
