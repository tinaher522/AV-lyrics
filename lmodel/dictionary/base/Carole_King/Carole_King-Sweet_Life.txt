<song artist="Carole_King" title="Sweet_Life">
So you think you got the weight
Of the world on your shoulders
And it's getting too hard to bear
You feel like you're getting older and older
And nobody seems to care
It isn't what you do, it's who you know
Ain't that the way it is any more
Makes you keep on wondering
Don't it make you wonder now
What are you living for
Well, it's a sweet life, baby, don't you think maybe
You can give it another try
It's your life, baby, but I'm not ready to say goodbye
We got a sweet life, baby, why don't you take a good look around
It's a sweet life, baby, don't let it get you down
Y'say you feel snowed under by circumstances
You can make of it what you will
You can look at the downside or take your chances
And try to make it uphill
Now you can't keep living inside your head
In a prison cell all your own
Just let yourself go, get your body out of bed
You don't have to do it all alone
Well it's a sweet life, baby, don't you think maybe
You can give it another try
It's your life, baby, but I'm not ready to say goodbye
Y'know this is real life, baby,
Why don't you take another look around
It's a sweet life, baby, don't let it get you down
It's a sweet life, baby, don't you think maybe
You can stop and taste the honey
It's a sweet life, baby, it's all about the sugar
It ain't about money
It's a sweet life, baby, don't you think maybe
You can give it another try
It's a sweet life, baby, and I'm not ready to say goodbye
It's a sweet life, baby
It's a sweet life, baby
It's a sweet life, baby
