<song artist="Carole_King" title="One_Small_Voice">
The Emperor's got no clothes on
No clothes? That can't be--he's the Emperor
Take that child away
Don't let the people hear the words he has to say
One small voice
Speaking out in honesty
Silenced, but not for long
One small voice
Speaking with the values we were taught as children
So you walk away and say, Isn't he divine?
Don't those clothes look fine on the Emperor?
And as you take your leave, you wonder why you're feeling
So ill-at-ease--don't you know?
Lies take your soul
You can't hide from yourself
Lies take their toll on you
And everyone else
One small voice speaking out in honesty
Silenced, but not for long
One small voice speaking with the values we were taught as children
Tell the truth
You can change the world
But you'd better be strong
The Emperor's got no clothes on, no clothes
He doesn't want to know what goes on, though everyone knows
One small voice: The Emperor's got no clothes on
One small voice: The Emperor's got no clothes on
One small voice can change the world
But you'd better be strong
