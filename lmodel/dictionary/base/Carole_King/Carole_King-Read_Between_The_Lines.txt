<song artist="Carole_King" title="Read_Between_The_Lines">
I wrote you a letter the other day
And I told you I was happy for you
And your new love
Now there was much more
I wanted to say
But it's hard for me to get over
My last bit of pride
But if you read between the lines
You will know that I still love you
Oh, and I'll love you forever
And always
When we were together
I never thought
You would ever be anything else
But a friend and a true love
But time has thrown its net
And now I'm caught
And I'm helpless to tell you
How much I miss you by my side
But if you read between the lines
You will know that I still love you
Oh, and I'll love you forever
And always
Do you remember smiling at me
When I looked at you
And I first saw you
And I wanted you
And you wanted me
But it's over now and I just can't see 
How I'm gonna live without you
But if you read between the lines
You will know that I still love you
Oh, and I'll love you forever
And always
