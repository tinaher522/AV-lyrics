<song artist="Carole_King" title="Welcome_To_My_Living_Room">
Welcome to my living room
It's not a womb, it's not a tomb
Not a June bride or the December groom
Tonight, in Hyannis
We'll be playing at a reasonable volume here
In my living room
I'm gonna play some songs for you
There are so many I'd like to do,
If I don't get to them all, I hope    you'll forgive me

'Cause I'm sixty-two
And there's so many I'd like to do
Old and new
But I'll try to do all I can in the time they give me
Let's set aside all the fussing and fighting,
And make this night about songwriting
Sing and play some favorite tunes...
Welcome to my living room
