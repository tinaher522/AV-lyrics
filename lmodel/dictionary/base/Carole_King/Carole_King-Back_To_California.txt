BACK TO CALIFORNIA
by Carole King
I've been feelin' down in Atlanta
Immobile in Alabam
I'd rather be in traction
Than to be here where I am
Oh you Georgia red clay
ANd green Virginia pines
I've got to make it home somehow
Before I lose my mind
CHORUS:
So, won't you carry me back to California
I've been on the road too long
Take me to the West Coast, daddy
And let me be where I belong
Hey now, Philly, you street city
Been down by the railroad track
I know that you can be a sweet city
But I won't soon be back
Haystack towns and somkestown cities
Are nothin' I want to see
My own house on high ground
Is the only place I wnat to be
(CHORUS)
