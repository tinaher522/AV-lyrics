<song artist="Carole_King" title="Just_One_Thing">
Holding it together with barely any motion
Like so many motes of dust
My dreams keep stirring in me
But all I see are
Rivers of violence
Running red on the streets below me
While passionate strangers whisper desire
All I know is I'm on fire
I need just one thing I can believe in
Oh, just one thing
Just one thing I can believe in
Hiding in the shadows
I want to stand in the light
Trust is unknown to me
I've been betrayed by the night so long
I can never belong to anyone any more
Why does everybody think they know me
I go through the motions, playing my role
Nobody knows what's deep in my soul
I need just one thing I can believe in
Give me just one thing
Oh, just one thing I can believe in
Love let me down
I wanted to believe that love was the one thing
But every time I turned around, love let me down
In my imagination
I come out of the darkness
The moon in my fantasy smiles down on me
I am a child running wild and free
But then the fight for survival
Takes me out of my illusion
And I'm back in the emptiness, fear and defeat
Trapped in a rhythm I don't want to repeat
The taste of freedom is so close and sweet 
I've just gotta find a way off this dead-end street
I need just one thing I can believe in
I gotta find one thing
Just one thing I can believe in
I need one thing I can believe in
Let me find one thing
Gotta find one thing
Just one thing I can believe in
