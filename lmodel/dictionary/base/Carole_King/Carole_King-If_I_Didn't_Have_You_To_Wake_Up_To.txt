<song artist="Carole_King" title="If_I_Didn't_Have_You_To_Wake_Up_To">
What would I do if I didn't have you
To wake up to each day
Who'd take my troubles and put them in bubbles
And make them burst away
And where would I find the innocence
That tells me it's okay
If I didn't have you to wake up to each day
Your father's going to be a little bit jealous
When the boys come around to call
And when you don't come home on time
He'll be pacing up and down the hall
But that's just a part of growing up
What could I do anyway
If I didn't have you to wake up to each day
Should I be strict, should I be mean
Should I teach you discipline
The times say yes, but I say no
You'll learn it from within
I know that every mother thinks her child
Is the prettiest one
But you've got a smile that can't be refused
It even brightens up the sun
I wish I could make time stand still and
Just keep lookin' at you
But that's something even Old Methuselah wasn't able to do
I hope you come around to see me
When I'm feeble, old and gray
Oh, what would I do
If I didn't have you to wake up to each day
Oh, what would I do
If I didn't have you to wake up to each day
