THIS TIME
by Carole King
I go through the motions of being with people
When deep in my soul, I want to be where you are
I know we speak every night
But words only go so far, I know
It feels like an ocean of time we're apart
I know that I've said it before
But this time when I come home
I will stay with you
This time's the last time that I'm gonna go
Just close your eyes and imagine me home again
It isn't so far away
Soon I'll be back, and you'll never be alone again
This time I mean to stay
I promise you this time I'll do whatever it takes
To stay right by your side
I would do anything, I would give you everything
'cause you are everything to me
But until then
Gotta keep our emotions under control
It won't be easy to do
'cause all I want to do is kiss you, touch you,
hold you, love you, promise, I promise
I promise you, I'll stay with you, but 'til then
Just close your eyes, and imagine me home again
I mean every word I say
Soon I'll be back, and you'll never be alone again
This time I mean to stay
Just close your eyes, and imagine me home again
Soon I will be on my way (never gonna go)
This time I mean it, you'll never be alone again
This time I mean to stay
