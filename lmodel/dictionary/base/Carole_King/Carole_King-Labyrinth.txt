<song artist="Carole_King" title="Labyrinth">
What do you think, are we gonna stay lost in the maze
Of mind games and power plays
Or are we gonna take the chance of a lifetime
To see the light of day
What'll we see when we've used up the last supplies
Of rainbows and butterflies
I keep believing if we all work together
We will surely find a way
We are lost in a labyrinth
There's only one thing to do 
Just break down the walls
And reach out your hand to your brother
We can lead each other 
To where destiny calls
Faith and lovin' energy will see us through
After a while we will see 
The labyrinth isn't anyplace we need to be
Then we can come out from the heart of the darkness
Into a brighter day
One of these days we will know
The heart will take us anywhere we want to go
I only hope it's not too late for the purpose
Tho' just what that is I can't say
We are lost in a labyrinth
There's only one thing to do
Just know in your mind
You want to stand behind your brother
Reach out and lead each other
To a new age in time
Faith and lovin' energy will free your mind
