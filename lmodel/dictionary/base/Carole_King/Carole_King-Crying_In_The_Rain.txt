<song artist="Carole_King" title="Crying_In_The_Rain">
I'll never let you see
The way my broken heart is hurting me
I've got my pride and I know how to hide 
all my sorrow and pain
I'll do my crying in the rain
If I wait for cloudy skies
You won't know the rain from the tears in my eyes
You'll never know that I still love you so though
the heartaches remain
I'll do my crying in the rain
Raindrops fallin' from heaven
Could never wash away my misery
But since we're not together
I look for stormy weather
To hide these tears I hope you'll never see
Crying, crying in the rain
Some day when my cryin's done
I'm gonna wear a smile and walk in the sun
I may be a fool, but til then darling
You'll never see me complain
I'll do my crying in the rain
