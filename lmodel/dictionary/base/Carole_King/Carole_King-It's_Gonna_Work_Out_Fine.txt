IT'S GONNA WORK OUT FINE
by Carole King
CHORUS:
We've been putting each other
Through a hard time
And it's a mighty good feeling to 
Know we're gonna work it out 
It's gonna work out
Yeah, it's gonna work out fine
Take a look at the way it's going now
Makes you want to give a sigh of relief
You know the last thing I ever
Wanted to do
WAs to give you any grief
I guess it was a situation
That was bound to come up someday
But our feeling for each other won out
And I'm oh so glad to say
CHORUS
Even the best of relationships
Run the risk of going awry
There's a lot two people who care
about each other
Can do to make each other cry
Ain't it funny how it took a reunion
To help us to really see
With each other is the only way we can ever be
CHORUS
