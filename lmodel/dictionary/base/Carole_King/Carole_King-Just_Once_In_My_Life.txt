<song artist="Carole_King" title="Just_Once_In_My_Life">
There's a lotta things I want, a lotta things that I'd like to be
But girl, I don't foresee a rags to riches story for me
There's just one little dream I've got to make come true
There's just one round I've got to win, I can't be a loser with you
And baby, baby, just once in my life let me get what I want
Girl, don't let me down, just once in my life
Let me hold on to the good thing I've found
Don't let me down, baby, say that you'll be staying
'Cause I couldn't face the day, if you weren't here by my side
And if you went away, then I'd be left without any pride
I've given up on schemes 'cause every one fell through
I've given up so many things, don't ask me to give up on you
And baby, baby, just once in my life let me get what I want
Girl, don't let me down, just once in my life
Let me hold on to the good thing I've found
Don't let me down, baby, say that you'll be staying
That old pot of gold ain't so easy to find
But if you'll stand by me, girl, I'll keep peace of mind
I can't give you the world, but I will work hard for you, girl
Yes, I'll work hard, everyday, all my life, you will see
If you won't leave me, baby, don't leave
Please don't leave me
Oh no, don't leave
Just do this for me, baby
And baby, baby, just once in my life
Let me get what I want, girl, don't let me down
Just once in my life, let me hold on to the good thing I've found
Don't let me down, baby, say that you'll be staying
And baby, baby, just once in my life, let me get what I want
Girl, don't let me down, just once in my life
Let me hold on to the good thing I've found, don't let me down
Just once in my life, let me get what I want, girl, don't let me down
