I THINK I CAN HEAR YOU
by Carole King
What must i do, how can I serve you
Is it true what I do is the way to be near you
I'm listening, though sometimes I can't hear you.
Looikng around fills me with wonder
At the way you can keep this old world running smoothly
Thinking of you always seems to soothe me
I know you're probably not a aman or a woman 
or a time or a season
But I'm here and life is dear
And I guess that's  a good enough reason to say
Just let me do what you put me here to
Let me be what you want me to be
And I hope it'll cheer you
I'm listening and I think I can hear you
Even when I thought I didn't believe
You believed in me
And everyone is a part of you
And anyone can know you
All they've got to do is be
I'm listening, and I think I can hear you.
