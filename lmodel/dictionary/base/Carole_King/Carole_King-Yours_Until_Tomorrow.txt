<song artist="Carole_King" title="Yours_Until_Tomorrow">
Tonight, I hold to nothing
But the feelings in my soul
My heart overflows with
Emotions I just can't control
There's someone you are going to
But tonight, I just can't tell right from wrong
Let me be yours until tomorrow
Let me be yours until tomorrow
Give me one night of your life
Just be mine till the dawn
Tomorrow the real world
Will come crashing down on me
I know I must lose you
And that's the way it has to be
But tonight, I see no boundaries
So I beg you, before my chance is gone
Let me be yours until tomorrow
Let me be yours until tomorrow
Give me one night of your life
So I can go on
Till the dawn's intrusion
Ends this sweet illusion
Make believe you're mine, love
This is not goodbye, love
All I ask is one night
Till the morning sunlight
Won't you stay
Here in my arms and baby
Let me be yours until tomorrow
Let me be yours until tomorrow
