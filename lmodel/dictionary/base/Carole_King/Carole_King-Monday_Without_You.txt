<song artist="Carole_King" title="Monday_Without_You">
Yesterday was a perfect day
Living in make-believe
Perfect together
In your eyes I was number one
And you were all the world to me
Forever, ever and ever
But you have another life
You're going to somewhere I don't belong
I can't think about Monday
I can't think about watching you walk away
I only want to be with you
I just want to be with you
I can't think about anything else but Sunday
And the touch of you
I only want to be with you
I can't think about Monday without you
In an empty room
Waiting for a reason why
Trying, crying, dying
I know that it's over
But I don't want to hear you say goodbye
I can't think about Monday (I can't think about Monday)
I can't think about watching you walk away
I only want to be with you
I just want to be with you
I can't think about anything else but Sunday
And the touch of you
I only want to be with you
I can't think about Monday without you
(Can't think about)
(Can't think about)
(Can't think about)
(Can't think about)
I can't think about Monday (I can't think about Monday)
I can't think about watching you walk away
I only want to be with you
I just want to be with you
I can't think about anything else but Sunday
And the touch of you
I only want to be with you
I can't think about Monday without you
