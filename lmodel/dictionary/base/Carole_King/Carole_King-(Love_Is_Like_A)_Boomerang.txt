<song artist="Carole_King" title="(Love_Is_Like_A)_Boomerang">
If you want to give your heart
Don't be afraid to try
Love is like a boomerang
It comes right back to you
You've got a need for company
Someone you know will be there
Don't let your bruised and battered soul deny it
My scars are plain to see
But love's been good to me
And I know it's because I was willing to try it
So if you want to love again
Don't hesitate any more
Love is like a boomerang
It comes right back to you
Throw it out, let it fly
Let it soar, watch it sail across the sky
Mountains are there for you to climb
People are doing it all the time
You can make it to the top if you make your attempt a strong one
So if you want to give your heart
Don't be afraid to try
Love is like a boomerang
It comes right back to you
Comes right back to you
Right back
Let it fly
