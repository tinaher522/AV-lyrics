<song artist="Carole_King" title="I_Feel_The_Earth_Move">
I feel the earth move under my feet
I feel the sky tumblin' down
I feel my heart start to tremblin'
Whenever you're around
Ooh baby, when I see your face
Mellow as the month of May
Oh darlin', I can't stand it
When you look at me that way, hey
I feel the earth move under my feet
I feel the sky tumblin' down
I feel my heart start to tremblin'
Whenever you're around
Ooh darlin', when you're near me
And you tenderly call my name
I know that my emotions
Are somethin' I just can't tame
I just got to have ya, baby
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, yeah
I feel the earth move under my feet
I feel the sky tumblin' down, a-tumblin' down
I feel the earth move under my feet
I feel the sky tumblin' down, a-tumblin' down
I just a-lose control
Down to my very soul
I get hot and cold
All over, all over, all over, all over.
I feel the earth move under my feet
I feel the sky tumblin' down, a-tumblin' down
I feel the earth move under my feet
I feel the sky tumblin' down, a-tumblin' down
A-tumblin' down, a-tumblin' down
A-tumblin' down, a-tumblin' down
Tumblin' down
