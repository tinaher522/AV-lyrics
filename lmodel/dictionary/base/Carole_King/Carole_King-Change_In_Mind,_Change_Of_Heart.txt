CHANGE IN MIND, CHANGE OF HEART
by Carole King &amp; David Palmer
You and I
We ought to try to face the fact
The things we thought had value
They've all been taken back
We've been losing track of time
But time's no easy mark
I can see you've got a change in mind
But what we need is a change of heart
I can see you've got a change in mind
But what we need is a change of heart
You and me
It seems that we've been holding out
The things that once held meaning
We're no longer sure about
We've been moving down the line
Losing what time we've got
And since you say you've had a change in mind
Why don't you try a little change of heart
I can see you've got a change in mind
But what we need is a change of heart
Now I'm not asking anymore of you
Than I ask of myself
Oh, but when I say we need a new approach
Well, I don't mean to someone else
Change, they say
It's the only way we grow
Oh, but the change we're showing
Let me tell you I just don't know
Seems to me that we could find some 
other way to start
Beginning with a change, a change in mind
And ending with a change, a change of heart
Oh, begin it with a change, a change in mind
But end it with a change, a change of heart
