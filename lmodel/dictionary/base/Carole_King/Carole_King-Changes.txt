<song artist="Carole_King" title="Changes">
With my limited vision
I don't understand
Why anybody has to lose a friend
Everybody has to follow their heart
But it can hurt so bad
To see changes
I believed in something
I thought you did too
But I didn't know what you were going through
How can people be so close, yet apart
There's no wrong or right
It's just changes
Once I experienced the other end
I lost a friend or two
Doing what was true for me
Even though I know that time will make it right
I miss the way things used to be
I'm only human
And I may never know
All the reasons why people come and go
I guess if we can love it all transcends
There's enough to give
We've got our lives to live
Through changes
