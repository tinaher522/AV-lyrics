WRAP AROUND JOY
by Carole King &amp; David Palmer
My mama loves me, she's my best friend
I know my daddy's with me right to the end
Oh, but my baby's got the final say
And what he says, it turns me every way
But loose, he say now
Oo-ee baby, wrap around joy
What it takes to save me, that wrap around joy
I believe in salvation. 
I don't doubt what I've found
I just can't do without it,
oh, that good old wrap around
My baby calls me late Friday night
He sounds so crazy but he feels so right
He says "Get ready mama, now lighten your load
And I'll be right over for the next episode"
Here we go now
Oo-ee, baby, wrap around joy
That's what he gave me, that wrap around boy
He's been my undoin'
I've been coming unwound
But I don't mind unwindin' for some
good old wrap around
Oo-ee, baby, wrap around joy
That's what he gave me,
that wrap around boy
