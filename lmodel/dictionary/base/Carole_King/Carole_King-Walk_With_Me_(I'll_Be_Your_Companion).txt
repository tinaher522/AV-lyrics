<song artist="Carole_King" title="Walk_With_Me_(I'll_Be_Your_Companion)">
I am me--who are you
I'm on my way to somewhere through tomorrow
If that's where you're going, too
Would you care to walk with me today
Living for the moment--feelin' what I feel
Nowhere in particular to go
And nothing to conceal
Walk with me--I'll be your companion
I may not have an awful lot to say
You can be anything you want to
And anytime you want to walk away--it's okay
Chances come--fortunes go
And I don't know what lies beyond the crossroad
Since I'm tryin' to travel light
I got no past or future on my mind
Through all my reflections--one thing is plain to see
Knowin' I am not alone
Means more than anything to me
