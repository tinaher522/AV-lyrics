In The name Of Love
by Carole King
Do the things you believe in
In the name of love
And know that you aren't alone
We all have doubts and fears
Know throughout every season
You are the name of love
And you'll keep on feeling at home
Throughout the coming years
Change is for certain
This is we all know
Each day opening the curtain
On a brand new show
Through your sorrow and grieving
Don't forget the name of love
It goes on without any end
Forever
Birth and life and death make a circle
We are all part of
To see the light ever lasting
Live in the name of love
Forever
