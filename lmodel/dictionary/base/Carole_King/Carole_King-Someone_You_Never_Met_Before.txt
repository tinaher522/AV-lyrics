<song artist="Carole_King" title="Someone_You_Never_Met_Before">
When the sun goes down
Over the canyon
And you're feeling
Lost and abandoned
Some stranger may knock
Upon your door
And it may be like knowing
Someone you never met before
Now it may be a common sensation
It may lead to sadness or elation
But it's a chance 
That you never had before
And it may be like knowing
Someone you never met before
Don't be afraid 
The game's not been played
Until you discover your love
She's waiting for you
And all you gotta do
Is let her in, and get her in
And don't live life lonely
So when the sun
Goes down on the city
Don't give in to feeling self-pity
Your lover may be
Knocking on the door
And it may be like knowing
Someone you never met before
Someone you never met before
