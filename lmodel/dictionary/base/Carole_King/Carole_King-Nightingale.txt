<song artist="Carole_King" title="Nightingale">
Like some nightbird homeward winging
He seeks that sheltered nest
Like the sailor's lost horizon
He needs some place to rest
The songs that he's been singing 
No longer make much sense
And those strangers' cold perceptions
They've killed his confidence
Nightingale
She sails away upon a sea of song
Nightingale
She serenades his lonely, lonely life along
When his tired voice is broken
His golden hope is gone
She makes a lost soul's simple longing
Somehow not so wrong
Nightingale
He was strong but he was taken
By the thought of his success
Those spotlight shadows how they lured him
And took him like all the rest
But that old dream don't look good now
No it don't seem quite the same
He needs to hear a tender word
Won't you sing him home again
Nightingale 
She sails away upon a sea of songs
Nightingale
She serenades his lonely, lonely life along
When his strength is slowly going
His pride is all but gone
She makes a foolish dreamer listen 
To one last song
Nightingale 
Sing sweet nightingale
