<song artist="Carole_King" title="All_My_Time">
The world exploded
And all the funny people who were with me
Flew away
Taking with them yesterday
And other things I could do without
Didn't you smile at me
Didn't you laugh at me
When you first knew I wanted you
And I've been thinking what you thought about
All my time, all my time
All my time belongs to you
And now it changes
Waking up and finding me
I'm where I want to be
If this is all I ever know
I'll never have a reason to complain
Didn't you smile at me
Didn't you laugh at me
The inner sun begins to shine
And soon you'll stop believing in the rain
All my time, all my time
All my time belongs to you
All my time
All my time
