SOMEONE WHO BELIEVES IN YOU
by Gerry Goffin &amp; Carole King
When there's a dark storm your horizon
And you think you can't get through it
Just put your hand in my hand
And I'll show you how to do it
When your future looks uncertain
You can count on me to be there
And when your heart and soul are hurting
Just look and you'll see me there
Just follow ehre I lead
I'll give you what you need
A love that's always true
Is some who believes in you
It's time to come alive
your moment has arrived
I'll bring out the best in you
We can have it all
No, we will never fall
Looking down from our celestial view
So when you're searching for that rainbow
I will help you find it
And when a mountain stands before you
I will help you climb it
Just follow where I lead
I'll give you what you need
And I'll tell you something else
You'll start believing in yourself
It's an easy thing to do
When you've got someone who 
believes in you
Someone who believes
Someone who believes
I'm someone who believes 
You've got someone who 
believes in you
