<song artist="Carole_King" title="Everybody's_Got_The_Spirit">
You can feel it in the air
Like a circle growing
You can tune right into it
If you know what you're looking for
If you want to be a part of it
Open the door to your heart and your mind
You can't help but find
As you begin to soar
Everybody's got the spirit
Yeah, you know what I mean
Working together, keeping it nice and easy
Keeping it free
There's a train pulling in
To the nearest station
Fare is low
You can go if you want to
If you're gonna get on board
Now is the time, 'cause it's on the move
The music is soothing
The rhythm is grooving
People growing all the time in every way
Learning where they are in terms of every day
Might as well keep moving, time won't let you stay
Everybody's got the spirit
