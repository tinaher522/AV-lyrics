<song artist="Carole_King" title="Spaceship_Races">
Baby, you're so frazzled
Spinning around in a busby swirl
With all that razzle, dazzle
I know at heart you want 
A down-home girl
Oh, you know I want to take you to
The Spaceship Races
Watch them do a few laps 
Around the sun
But if you don't go in 
For far out places
I'll take you home with me
When the day is done
Baby, you're so scattered
Your span of attention is shrinking fast
Your brain's been battered
By all the disapointments 
Of the recent past
Oh, you know I want to take you to
The Spaceship Races
Watch them do a few laps 
Around the sun
But if you don't go in 
For far out places
I'll take you home with me
When the day is done
Didn't I see you 
Walking on Main Street
Lookin' in windows 
Waiting by turnstiles
Thinkin' of things 
You thought you'd like to buy
Livin' off dreams 
Stored up in film cans 
Lookin' at screens just 
Waitin' your turn while 
You looked up and saw 
A rocket in the sky
Oh, you know I want to take you to
The Spaceship Races
Watch them do a few laps 
Around the sun
But if you don't go in 
For far out places
I'll take you home with me
When the day is done
When the day is done
