<song artist="Carole_King" title="The_Ballad_Of_Chicken_Soup">
Today our dear friend
Chicken Soup
This very ordinary day
Boiled up a pot of
Chicken soup
And swallowed it away
A-lack! A-day!
O-Woe! Oy-Vey!
He swallowed it away!
Now listen to what I'm gonna say
A little bone, a bitty thing
No bigger than my pinky-
He swallowed hot
From out that pot
In quicker than a winky
He gulped that soup
Let out a whoop!
And fell down croaking
On the stoop
And he Choked!
And he SAGGED!
And he SMOTHERED!
And he GAGGED!
And he let out a SCREAM!
And he let out a MOAN!
Then he cried
'Cause he died
From choking on a bone
On such an ordinary day
Like today
A-lack! A-day!
O-Woe! Oy-Vey!
On an ordinary day
Chicken soup passed away!
