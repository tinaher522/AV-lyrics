Alabaster Lady
I have always wanted to be a girl like you
Long of leg and seeing the world the way you do
But you're in tiny golden chains
Somehow I think you know it don't make sense for you
To let your wings be held by someone
Who's too intense for you
Alabaster Lady
You are such a sweet and sensual spirit
There's a joy within him singing
And he loves you 'cause he knows that you can hear it
Still the child within remains
And though he knows that you have pains to talk about
He sees your soul as you walk about
And doesn't dare to let himself get near it
You're so very young
Your life is just beginning
Your consciousness begun
Like a sleepy child awakening
As you reach out for me
With confidence still to come 
Can you teach me to be free
Of my fear of being struck down by the pendulum
Alabaster Lady 
As you weave a web of love with azure flowers
The early morning hours
Bring to you the misty light of dawn
And he, knowing you'll be gone, only tries
To hold you closer to him
If you only knew your powers 
You could save him
You could save him by just saying, 
NO SIR to him
Come on, Alabaster Lady
You say that you love him--just be yourself
You can save him if you try
Come on Alabaster Lady
Y'know just where you're goin'
Keep on growin'
And let yourself just fly 
Come on, Alabaster Lady
Come on now, Alabaster Lady
