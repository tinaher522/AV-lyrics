BRIGHTER
by Carole King
We've been knowing each other
For many a year, it's true
And I can't think of anyone else
Can make me feel as good as you
Yeah, you make my day
A little bit brighter in every way
I'm so glad to have you
In this old troubled time
When true love and understanding, child
AARe so hard to find
Yes, you make my day
A little bit brighter every day
SOme people live in darkness
Their whole life through
I just know that I'd have been one of them
If it hadn't been for you
Now, sometimes I feel afraid
AS we all tend to do
But I think of the loving good times we've had
And I know we're gonna make it through
Cause you make my day
A little bit brighter in every way
