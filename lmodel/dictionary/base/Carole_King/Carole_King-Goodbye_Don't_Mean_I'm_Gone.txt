GOODBYE DON'T MEAN I'M GONE
by Carole King
Don't it seem like the time goes on
And here we are still carrying on
Reaching out for one another
Like a telephone call 
from an old friend or a brother
And you are there to share this 
song in the making
Goodbye don't mean I'm gone
I know how alone you are
When it's so hard to be so far
From the ones who mean the most to you
WHen you would so much rather
have them close to you
I hope you know you haven't been forsaken
Goodbye don't mean i'm gone
I'll never be what you think you see in me
If I can help you deal with what you see as real
That makes me glad to have known you
Missing you the way I do
You know I'd like to see more of you
But it's all I can do to be a mother
My baby is in one hand,
I've a pen in the other
You know my love is always there for the taking
And goodbye don't mean I'm gone
