<song artist="Carole_King" title="So_Ready_For_Love">
I've been waiting to find someone just like you
I knew when I saw you
I'd be someone who could bring out the best in you
I would be good for you
I can tell
Though I don't know you well
You're so ready for love
The time is right
It's a new moon tonight
And you're so ready for love
Sure, you say that you've been hurt by love
In the past
Well, haven't we all been
Whatcha gonna do for the rest of your life
Hide your head in the sand
Well, that won't last
Don't you hear love callin'
I can see
By the way you look at me
You're so ready for love
The time is right 
It's a new moon tonight
And you're so ready for love
How many people get the chance to love again
Though you might think that you can do without it
But if you pass and lose someone who's really right for you
There won't be a thing that you can do about it
Maybe I've been on too heavy for you
But I believe we can do it
I can see 
By the way you look at me
You're so ready for love
The time is right
It's a new moon tonight
And you're so ready for love
