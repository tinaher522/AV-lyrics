<song artist="Carole_King" title="Loving_You_Forever">
I was just leaving, the night was winding down
You touched my shoulder, and I turned around
Here we are, the hardest part is done
And all that's left is loving you forever
My heart stopped beating, I couldn't let it show
You were as unexpected, as roses in the snow
Just like that, I knew you were the one
Now all that's left is loving you forever
In this world, we're luckily if we find

A spark that sparks one time
Like when we are together
And in that moment, it happened so fast
My prayers were answered, I found love at last
Take my hand, our life has begun
And all that's left is loving you forever
Here we are, the hardest part is done
And all that's left is loving you forever
