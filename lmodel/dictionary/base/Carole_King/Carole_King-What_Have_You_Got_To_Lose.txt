<song artist="Carole_King" title="What_Have_You_Got_To_Lose">
Yes, I know you've loved and lost
And you've been figurin' up the cost
Of your last, your saddest goodbye
I'm gonna stay right here with you
So if you're looking for somethin' new
All you have to do is choose
What have you got to lose?
Yes it shows you need a change
And you've been feelin' very strange 'bout the 
Things that made you feel so good before
And I've been feelin' blue
'Cause I'm so much in love with you
And all  you'd have to do is try something new
What have you got to lose?
And when you're ready, let me know
Come to me, come, let your river flow
When you're ready, oh... give me a sign
It's time you stepped back out in the sunshine
Wouldn't you like to wake up and find
Me every morning on your mind
Oh, come on, don't be shy
Come on, you don't have to hide
Come on and get me
What have you got to lose?
Come on and get me
Oh, what have you got to lose?
