A NIGHT THIS SIDE OF DYING
by Carole King &amp; David Palmer
I remember one young sister with rainbows in her eyes
Standing on the corner with the afternoon's supply
She spoke of other places, perhaps a better road
Then she asked if I could tell her where they 
kept the mother lode
Like a night this side of dying
Her day's inside the dropper on the shelf
When she hears her lifeline crying
Not a thing you say can stop her
When she just can't stop herself
I remember that July, the panic and the heat
The savage shine of summer, the trychnine in the street
The way thay sold each other for a favor in glassine
The best of friends sold brothers for a
dime of quinine dreams
Like a night this side of dying
Her day's inside the dropper on the shelf
Like the shelter she's been buying
Not a thing I've got can save her
When she just can't save herself
She just can't save herself
