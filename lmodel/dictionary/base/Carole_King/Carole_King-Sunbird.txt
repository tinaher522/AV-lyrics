<song artist="Carole_King" title="Sunbird">
Wind blow
Moon glow
You know the way to be
Touching everything
Going through to the second sea
Starlight
Sunbird
The music inside us all
Touches everyone
Everyone, listen for the call
Sunbird is enough just being
Fulfilled in its own existence
Can't we let it be
Why can't we just be
And let the time of spring to fall not be a distance
Reborn
New dawn
Brings on another day
I'm no older now than yesterday
And I'm on my way
