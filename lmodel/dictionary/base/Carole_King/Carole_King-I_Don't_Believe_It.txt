<song artist="Carole_King" title="I_Don't_Believe_It">
You're coming on strong now
You think you're the one
You think you're the one that can change all the seasons 
But you're giving me reasons not to believe it
I can hear everything you say
Hey now--but what about the things that you do
You come on so sweetly
You understand me completely
And I don't believe it
Taking it lightly but it's not very likely
That you'll ever find me, yeah
Looking for you and the things that you do
You've got all the equipment and you know
You're aware of the fact that the boys call you foxy
But to me it's just lazy 'cause you don't really mean
You say that you're sincere
Hey, but that ain't the same story I hear
You come on so sweetly
You understand me completely
But I don't believe it
No, I don't believe it
No, I don't believe it
I don't believe it
No, I don't believe it
I don't believe it
I don't believe it
No, I don't believe it
And I don't believe it
I don't believe it
Believe it
Believe it
