HEY GIRL
by Gerry Goffin &amp; Carole King
Hey girl I want you to know
I'm gonna miss you so much if you go
And hey girl I tell you no lie
Something deep inside of me's going to die
If you say so long, if this is goodbye
Hey girl this can't be true
How am I supposed to exist without you
And hey girl now don't put me on
What's gonna happen to me when you're gone
How will I live, How can I go on
How can I go on, Hey Girl
Hey girl now sit yourself down
I'm not ashamed to get down on the ground
And then beg you to stay
Don't go away, Hey Girl
I beg you please don't go away 
Hey girl
