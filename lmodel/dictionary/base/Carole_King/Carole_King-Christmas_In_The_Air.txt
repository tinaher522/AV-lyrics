<song artist="Carole_King" title="Christmas_In_The_Air">
Christmas time in the middle of a city
Seeking its salvation
With every string of lights
That suddenly appears
Children stare with new found wonder
No one dares to break the trance
Every wish is carefully numbered
And God has granted all a second chance
This day
And all at once
The dream's begun
And as we mark the old year's passing
Strangers greet
On every street
And suddenly there's goodwill everywhere
There's Christmas in the air
On this night
To this light
We see it all again
On this night
To this light
We see it all again
On this night
To this light
We see it all again
On this night
To this light
We see it all again
All again
On this winter night
We still wait for you
And now the time has come
When all the world is one
And as we mark the old year's passing
Strangers greet
On every street
And suddenly there's goodwill everywhere
There's Christmas in the air
There comes a time when we're on our own
Some times in life such a thing must be
But such a thing should not be known
This night
This night
This night
And now the time has come
And now the time has come
And now the time has come
And now the time has come
And now the time has come
And all the world is one
And as we mark the old year's passing
Strangers greet
On every street
And suddenly there's goodwill everywhere
There's Christmas in the air
The final letter that she read
Was from a younger man
It came with a journal
That was all written by hand
He had done something so wrong in life
That he no longer wished to live
But on this night he had a dream
And found that God forgives
If we truly regret how others we have hunt
He will understand
So he took the message from this night
And became a different man
