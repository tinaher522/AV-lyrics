<song artist="Carole_King" title="Lay_Down_My_Life">
As I walk away 
My world comes tumbling down 
That's all right 
You'll go home again without me 
Where will I go tomorrow 
It doesn't matter if you want me to stay 
Should I turn around 
Come back to you 
Or should I keep on walking away 
It feels so good with you 
It feels so right with you 
But I will bring you sorrow if I stay 
I would lay down my life for you 
I would lay down my life for you 
I would lay down my life for you 
I would lay down my life for you 
I kept going on 

When going on made no real sense at all 
But it's no good now 
It's all clear to me 
Now that my back is against the wall 
How will you get through tomorrow 
It doesn't matter, I know you will 
And we'll be together forever 
Bound by the way we made each other feel 
And I will lay down my life for you 
I will lay down my life for you 
'Cause it feels so good with you 
Yes it feels so right with you 
I will lay down my life for you 
I will lay down my life for you 
I will lay down my life 
I will lay down my life for you
