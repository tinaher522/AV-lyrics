<song artist="Carole_King" title="Where_You_Lead">
Wanting you the way I do 
I only wanna be with you 
And I would go to the ends of the earth 
Cause darling to me that's what you're worth 
Where you lead 
I will follow 
Anywhere, that you tell me to 
If you need, you need me to be with you 
I will follow 
Where you lead 
If you're out on the road 
Feeling lonely and so cold 
All you have to do is call my name 
And I'll be there 
On the next train 
Where you lead 
I will follow 
Anywhere, that you tell me to 
If you need, you need me to be with you 
I will follow 
Where you lead 
I always wanted a real home 
With flowers on the windowsill 
But if you wanna live in New York City 
Honey, you know I will 
(yes I will, yes I will) 
I never thought I could get satisfaction 
From just one man 
But if anyone could keep me happy 
You're the one who can 
Where you lead 
I will follow 
Anywhere, that you tell me to 
If you need, you need me to be with you 
I will follow 
Where you lead
Where you lead 
I will follow 
Anywhere, that you tell me to 
If you need, you need me to be with you 
I will follow 
Where you lead 
Oh baby, oh, I'm gonna follow where you lead 
I'm gonna follow where you lead 
(I'm gonna follow where you lead)
Oh baby, oh, I'm gonna follow where you lead 
I'm gonna follow where you lead 
(I'm gonna follow where you lead)
Oh baby, oh, I'm gonna follow where you lead 
I'm gonna follow where you lead 
(I'm gonna follow where you lead)
Oh baby, oh, I'm gonna follow where you lead 
I'm gonna follow where you lead 
(I'm gonna follow where you lead)
