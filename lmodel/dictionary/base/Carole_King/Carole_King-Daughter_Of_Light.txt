<song artist="Carole_King" title="Daughter_Of_Light">
Daughter of light
You're a welcome sight
To a weary soul
Seeing you just lifts me out of the cold
It's only temporary
You have to go away
But you're beautiful
And you never fail to make my day
Daughter of light
You smile and all the sadness leaves my heart
It's an easy course for sailing that you chart
But it's only temporary
You have to go away
You're too beautiful
And you know I'd never ask you to stay
Riding on the beach at sunset
Dreaming of the world that waits for you
That's where my mind's eye sees you
In a world that frees you
To do anything that you want to do
Daughter of light
Though you can only be a sometime friend
You restore my faith in love again
And that's not temporary
Even though you go away
You're too beautiful
Much more than words can say
