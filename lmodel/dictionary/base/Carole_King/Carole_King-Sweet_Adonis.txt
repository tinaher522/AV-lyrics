SWEET ADONIS
by Caroel King &amp; David Palmer
Waiting on tables while waiting on fame
In a city filled with numbers, they've forgotten their names
Like a lonely broken people without title, without claim
When every day's survival is one more night
of shame, night of shame
Welcome home, sweet Adonis
Welcome back, my old friend
I'm glad to see you made it through your contests once again
Welcome nome, sweet Adonis
You heart needs time to mend
Welcome home, sweet Adonis, my old friend
Hoping for the promise, staying for the show
In a world of brief advantage, the victims come and go
Their faces seem so honest, tehir manners have such style
Oh, but when hunger means existence
There's a feast in every smile, every smile
So welcome home, sweet Adonis
Welcome back, my old friend
I'm glad to see you made it up that hard 
road once again
Welcoem home, sweet Adonis
Your highway's found an end
Welcome home, sweet Adonis, welcome home
