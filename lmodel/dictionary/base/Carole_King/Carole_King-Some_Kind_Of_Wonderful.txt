<song artist="Carole_King" title="Some_Kind_Of_Wonderful">
All you have to do is touch my hand
to show me you understand
and something happens to me
that's some kind of wonderful
anytime my little world is blue
I just have to look at you
and everything seems to be
some kind of wonderful
I know I can't express
this feeling of tenderness
is so much I wanna say
but the right words just don't come my way
I just know when I'm in your embrace
this world is a happy place
and something happens to me
that's some kind of wonderful
somekind of wonderful
somekind of wonderful, wonderful
somekind of wonderful
