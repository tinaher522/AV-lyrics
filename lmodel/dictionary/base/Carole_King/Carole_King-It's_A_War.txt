<song artist="Carole_King" title="It's_A_War">
The moon is full and I'm awake
And I don't know how much
I can take
Before I get too angry to be sad
Too many people thinkin' mean
Good ones few and far between
Takin' out on you 
What they never had
It's a war, war
War any more
It's a war, war
War every day
You've got to keep your guard up
If someone else is hard up 
He'll try to steal your dreams away
Once I thought of compassion as
A feelin' everybody has
Do unto others 
That's the golden rule
But I found to my regret
People I had never met
Were out to get me--I was just a fool
It's a war, war
War any more
It's a war, war
War every day
You've got to keep your guard up
If someone else is hard up 
He'll try to steal your dreams away
