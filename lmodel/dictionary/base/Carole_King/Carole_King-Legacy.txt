<song artist="Carole_King" title="Legacy">
You used to be as a child
Full of hope and wonder
Hey, now, do you remember those days
Your mind was free and running wild
Now the sound of thunder 
Has got you trapped in a corner hiding out
You're running in a rat maze
You better think about the legacy
That you want to leave behind
It's all getting burnt-out, used-up
Bought and sold to the bottom line
That ain't the way it's gotta be
You can leave a better world than you find
You can look down, turn aside, run away
But you can't put it out of your mind
'Cause it's your legacy 
Don't it make your heart bleed
Passing through the meadowland
Wheel of fortune jackpot is what it looks like
That's okay, go on, run your motor at high speed
Rev it up to five grand
Shades on, top down
But as you barrel down the turnpike
You better think about the legacy
That you're gonna leave behind
Things are getting wasted out of hand 
People stealing each other blind
Hey, that ain't the way it oughta be
You can leave a better world than you find
You can look down, turn around, run away
But you can't put it out of your mind
'Cause it's your legacy 
It isn't easy when you think your voice
Doesn't matter to anyone
Maybe you believe there's nothing you can do
But if you just do nothing, you've made a choice
To perpetuate the destruction
Why don't you stand up, dig in
When it all comes down, it's gotta begin with you
It's you
It's your legacy
Baby, whatcha gonna do about it
You better think about the legacy
That you want to leave behind
Things are getting wasted, out-of-hand, burnt-out, used-up
Sold to the bottom line
Hey, that ain't the way it's gotta be
Oh, don't you want to leave a better world than you find
You can look down, turn aside, run away and hide
But you can't put it out of your mind
'Cause it's your legacy 
Oh, your legacy
Look here
It's gotta start somewhere, Jack
If you don't go forward, you're gonna go back
Hey, you better get a plan of attack
'Cause that's the only way that you're gonna keep track
Of your legacy
