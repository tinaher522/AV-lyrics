<song artist="Carole_King" title="Lovelight">
I want to see the lovelight in your eyes
I want to see the longing in your eyes
When you look at me
I want it to be the way it used to be
I want to see the lovelight in your eyes
I want to feel the passion in your touch
I want to feel the burning love I need so much
When I reach for you
I want you to hold me like you used to do
I want to see the lovelight in your eyes
I want to see the lovelight in your eyes
I want to see the lovelight in your eyes
I want to see the lovelight in your eyes
You used to walk with me on the street of dreams
I remember you telling me
You said nothing is what is seems
Now as I walk alone, cold in the morning after
Thoughts of you in someone else's arms
In someone else's bed
Explode inside my head
I want to see the lovelight in your eyes
I want to see the fire back in your eyes
When you look at me
I want it to be the way it used to be
I want to see the lovelight in your eyes
I want to see the lovelight in your eyes
I want to see the lovelight in your eyes
I want to see the lovelight in your eyes
