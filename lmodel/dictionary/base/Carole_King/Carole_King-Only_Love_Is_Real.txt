<song artist="Carole_King" title="Only_Love_Is_Real">
As I bask in the glow of a just-lit fire
Feeling the warmth as the flames grow higher
I think it's true that nothing
is really new under the sun
Watching a new love grow
from old love's embers
Yesterday's gone but today remembers
Doesn't it seem to come down the same for everyone
(Chorus)
Only love is real
Everything else illusion
Adding to the confusion of the way we connive
At being alive
Tracing a line till we can define
The thing that allows us to feel
Only love is real
Childhood dreams like muddy waters
Flowing through me to my son and daughters
Everything I ever thought is confirmed as truth to me
Even as I see the way that I want to go now
Still I had wished I had known what I know now
Maybe I could have spared you
Giving your youth to me
(Chorus)
Only love is real
Everything else illusion
Adding to the confusion of the way we connive
At being alive
Tracing a line till we can define
The thing that allows us to feel
Only love is real
