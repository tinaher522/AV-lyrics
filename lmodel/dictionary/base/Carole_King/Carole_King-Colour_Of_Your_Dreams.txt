<song artist="Carole_King" title="Colour_Of_Your_Dreams">
Live in the colour of your dreams
Know everything you see is not quite what it seems
Take everything you have to give
If you believe it, you can make it what you want to
All you gotta do is say you will
Go for the vision in your mind
Throw all your doubt away, just leave it all behind
You are the owner of the game
Nothing will ever be the same once you have played it
You know you're gonna win if you just say you will
Oh, everything you'll ever need you already know
Oh, the only place to go
Is where angels ride the sunset and heaven lies below
So dream of the day when you will fly
And let the wings of your destiny carry you through the sky
Take everything you have to give
If you believe it, you can make it what you want to
And be living in the colour of your dreams
