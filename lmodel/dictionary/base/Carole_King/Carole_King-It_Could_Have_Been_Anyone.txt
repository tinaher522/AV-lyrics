Words and Music by
Carole King, Carole Bayer Sager &amp; David Foster 
Do you know that you know me like nobody else
All of my secrets and lies
Do you know that you made me believe in myself
Made me believe I could fly
All the things that you say
That I wait for each day
You're almost too good to be true
[Chorus] 
It could have been anyone, oh, anyone
A stranger out of the blue
It could have been anyone, oh anyone
That I gave my heart up to
But it was you
Well you just never know when 
the moment will come
When love is about to begin
Something about someone reaching out
And letting someone in
And I'm glad I was there
When out of thin air
We both had nothing to do
[Chorus]
One day we'll find out
Why you were sent to me
Now we're together
It must be the way it was meant to be
[Chorus]
