<song artist="Carole_King" title="It's_Never_Too_Late">
I used to watch all the couples going by
Feeling left out and so alone
But now I feel so much a part of them
Because I've got a man of my own
It's never too late to fall in love again
And I know, and I know
That it's true
You treat me with so much tenderness, love and respect
And I just love everything that you do
When I needed the comfort of a strong man's arms
You chased away my blues
Remember the first time when we made love
Brothers and sisters, have you heard the news
It's never too late to fall in love again
It don't pay, it don't pay
To sit there remembering when
No matter how much pain and heartache you've known
It's never too late
Never too late to love again
It's never too late to fall in love again
It's never too late to fall in love again
It's never too late to fall in love again
And I know, and I know
That it's true
It's never too late to fall in love again
I just love every little thing that you do
It's never too late to love again
