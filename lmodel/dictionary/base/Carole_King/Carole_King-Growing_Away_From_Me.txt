GROWING AWAY FROM ME
by Carole King
You've been my life to me
My very soul and my heart
But lately something's come over you
And it's tearing me apart
CHORUS:
Darlin' I feel you growing away from me
More and more each day
Whatever you want me to be I'll be
If it keeps you from growing away from me
Even whe you say you love me
The feeling's no longer there
I know there's somebody else
And it's more than I can bear
CHORUS
Believe me, I would let you go if I could
But I don't know if it's worse thing being lonely
Than having you here in body only
It's no use pretending
When the love you used to feel is gone
Yet even though I'm losing you
I can't help tryin' to hold on
CHORUS
I feel you
Growing away from me
