SWEET SWEETHEART
by Gerry Goffin &amp; Carole King

CHORUS:
You're a sweet sweetheart
You've been a real good friend
You're around when I'm down 
to pick me up again
Tho' it could never been said
To my faults you're blind
You overlook the bad and 
you keep all the good in mind
Now there have been times
When we couldn't get on
And tho't I'd have to admit
the feeling was gone
But you just closed your mind
to all the seeds of doubt
And somehow you found a way
to make it all work out
(CHORUS)
Now when you come home
at the close of the day
You gotta a way of lookin'
that sends message my way
What this message means
Any old fool could see
And the thing that make me feel so well
is you meant it just for me
(CHORUS)
