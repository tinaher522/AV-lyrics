<song artist="Carole_King" title="Where_You_Lead,_I_Will_Follow">
Loving you the way I do
I know we're gonna make it through
And I would go to the ends of the earth
'Cause, darling, to me that's what you're worth
Where you lead, I will follow
Anywhere that you tell me to
If you need, you need me to be with you
I will follow where you lead
If you're out on the road
Feeling lonely and so cold
All you have to do is call my name
And I'll be there on the next train
Where you lead, I will follow
Anywhere that you tell me to 
If you need, you need me to be with you 
I will follow where you lead
I always wanted a real home with flowers on the window sill
But if you want to live in New York City, honey, you know I will
You never know how it's all gonna turn out, but that's okay
Just as long as we're together, we can find a way
And where you lead, I will follow 
Anywhere that you tell me to
If you need, you need me to be with you
I will follow, oh 
Where you lead, I will follow
Anywhere that you tell me to
If you need, you need me to be with you
I will follow where you lead
