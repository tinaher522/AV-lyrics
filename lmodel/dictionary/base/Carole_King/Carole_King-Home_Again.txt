<song artist="Carole_King" title="Home_Again">
Sometimes I wonder if I'm
Ever gonna make it home again.
It's so far and out of sight.
I really need someone to talk to
And nobody else
Knows how to comfort me tonight.
Snow is cold; Rain is wet.
Chills my soul right to the marrow.
I won't be happy 'til I see
You alone again.
'Til I'm home again and feelin' right.
Snow is cold; Rain is wet.
Chills my soul right to the marrow.
I won't be happy 'til I see
You alone again.
'Til I'm home again and feelin' right.
'Til I'm home again and feelin' right.
I wanna be home again and feelin' right.
