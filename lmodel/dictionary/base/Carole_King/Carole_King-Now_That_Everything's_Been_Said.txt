<song artist="Carole_King" title="Now_That_Everything's_Been_Said">
Oh, now that everything's been said 
Now that everything's been done
How come you wanna leave me here
You say you got to get on along
Now, all the time I wasted
Tryin' to build a house to last
You get up this morning, pack up your sack 
And tell me you'll send for the rest
Now, how come you wanna leave me here
Is it something that I said
Or is it just your style that after a while
You've got to get up and get
Oh, now that everything's been said
Now that everything's been done
How come you wanna leave me here
To work it out all on my own
Now, how come you wanna leave me here 
Is there something else I should know
You may think it's strange
I never noticed the change
That made you wanna get up and go
Get up and go
Now that everything's been said
Now that everything's been done
How come you wanna leave me here
