GOTTA GET THROUGH ANOTHER DAY
by Carole King
It's a gray, gray gloomy day
A strange and moody blues day
Gotta get through, gotta get through another day
Corn yellow silk and golden sunlight I remember
AS we walked together, you and I
Love like a sweet flaming glow inside
Now has been denied
And I've cried till I can't remember why
I Gotta get through, gotta get through some way
Gotta get through, gotta get through another day
Will Tuesday be "good news" day
Or another "paying dues" day
It's a strange and moody blues day anyway
Some say that time brings a better understanding
Of the ryme and reason to it all
Still the flame keeps burning through the lonely night
It's just not all right
ANd I wonder if I'll make it till you call
I Gotta get through, gotta get through some way
It's a gray, gray gloomy day, 
A strange and moody blues day
Gotta get through, gotta get through another day
