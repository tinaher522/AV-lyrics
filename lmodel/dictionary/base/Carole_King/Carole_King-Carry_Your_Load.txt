<song artist="Carole_King" title="Carry_Your_Load">
Meet me on the highway,
Meet me on the road,
As long as  you've got to travel
Don't you want someone to help you carry your load?
First time out is a heavy feeling
White clouds under my feet
Sailing along like a south wind
over a fields of wispering wheat
Thinking alone on a Thrusday morning
of peace and love and war
I still don't have an answers
but I don't get high anymore
Meet me on the highway,
Meet me on the road,
As long as  you've got to travel
Don't you want someone to help you carry your load?
Some folks are forever movin'
And some folks gotta be still
Don't let it get you there's joy in either
So don't what you will
Everyone knows it's the same old feelin'
Worlds below the sea
Just you and me and easy
Is where I wanna be.
Meet me on the road,
As long as  you've got to travel
Don't you want someone to help you carry your load?
carry, carry oh help you carry your load.
