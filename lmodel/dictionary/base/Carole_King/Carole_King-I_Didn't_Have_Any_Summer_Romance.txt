<song artist="Carole_King" title="I_Didn't_Have_Any_Summer_Romance">
They're always writing songs about a summer love
That never seems to last beyond the fall
But I've a different reason for crying this season
The reason that can hurt you most of all
I didn't have any summer romance
Nobody bothered to break my heart in two
While others were fooled by the sweet words someone vowed
I was the one who made company a crowd
I didn't walk down the beach in a trance
Or listen to little white lies that sounded true
And no one could be as blue as I was in the fall
'Cause I didn't have any summer romance at all
No one could be as blue as I was in the fall
'Cause I didn't have any summer romance at all
