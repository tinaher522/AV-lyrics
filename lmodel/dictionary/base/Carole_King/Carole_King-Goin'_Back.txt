<song artist="Carole_King" title="Goin'_Back">
I think I'm going back
To the things I learned so well 
In my youth
I think I'm returning to
The days when I was young enough 
To know the truth
Now there are no games 
To only pass the time
No more electric trains
No more trees to climb
Thinking young and growing older is no sin
And I can play the game of life to win
I can recall a time
When I wasn't ashamed to reach out 
To a friend
Now I think I've got
A lot more than just my toys 
To lend
Now there's much to do 
Than watch my sailboat glide
And every day can be 
My magic carpet ride
A little bit of courage is all we lack
So catch me if you can, I'm goin' back
A little bit of courage is all we lack
So catch me if you can, I'm goin' back
(La, la, la...)
