<song artist="Carole_King" title="My_Simple_Humble_Neighborhood">
Here's where it all began
Here's where I heard that beat
Here's where I tapped that tap
With my natural rhythm feet
In my simple humble neighborhood
On my simple humble street
Here's where the dreams I had
Were crowded on a stoop
Were pecked and pushed and hustled
Just like chickens in a coop
Life wasn't always neat
In my simple humble neighborhood
On my simple humble street
Here's where I learned the rules
Of Rosie's way
Of how to play
A magic game
That changed the same
Old sheepy bleat
In my simple humble neighborhood
On my simple humble street
Here's where I made up folks
Who came to visit me
Not just ordinary folks
Coming unexpectedly
TALENT SCOUTS! PRODUCERS! DIRECTORS!
GLAMOUR BOYS!
In other words
THE HOY-POLOYS!
THE GRAND ELITE!
To make them green with envy
In my simple humble neighborhood
On my simple humble street
Here's where it all began
Here's where I heard that tune
Here's where I sang of sailing
In a carnival balloon
Life was so darn sweet
In my simple humble neighborhood
On my simple humble street
