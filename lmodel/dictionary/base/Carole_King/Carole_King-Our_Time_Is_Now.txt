<song artist="Carole_King" title="Our_Time_Is_Now">
January, February, March,
The days are marching forward
April, May, June and July
They fly like a hummingbird
August, September, October
The year is almost over
November, December arrive
Another year, come and gone
Time is illusion
Time is a curse
Time is all these things and worse
But our time is now, oh
Yes, our time is now, oh
Let us sing before our time runs out
The sound of your laughter, your smile
These things are never changing
But Monday I blink and it's Friday
I wish we could slow it down
Saturday, Sunday, now Monday
Another week starting over
Seconds to minutes to hours
Here's what I've found
Time is illusion
Time is a curse
Time is all these things and worse
But our time is now, oh
Yes, our time is now, oh
Let us sing before our time runs out
Time is illusion
Time is a curse
Time is all these things and worse
But our time is now, oh
Yes, our time is now, oh
Let us sing before our time runs out
