<song artist="Carole_King" title="Standin'_On_The_Borderline">
We're standin' on the borderline
Between falling in love and falling apart
I'm ready to cross the borderline
If I can't have you, it'll break my heart
Nothing really holds a candle to love
But y'gotta know how to handle your love
If y'want it to last
Y'just can't let it burn out too fast
Y'can't stand still on the borderline
You either make your move or y' turn away
I'm too close to the borderline
I'm coming across it, y' want me to stay
Y'know I'm experienced
Every day can't be a fireworks show
But when y'walk in the room
And it starts to glow
You don't have to tell me
I already know
We're ready to cross the borderline
Between falling in love and falling apart
We're ready to cross the borderline
If I can't have you, it'll break my heart
We're standin' on the borderline
Ready to cross the borderline
Standin' on the borderline
If I can't have you, it'll break my heart
We're standin' on the borderline
Ready to cross the borderline
Standin' on the borderline
If I can't have you, it'll break my heart
