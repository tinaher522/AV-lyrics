<song artist="Carole_King" title="Down_To_The_Darkness">
Everything's lost in illusion
I keep moving, but I can't seem to get out of the shadows
Out into the light of day
Everyone's out in the afternoon
Turning their faces up to the sun like a spotlight
What's wrong with me, I don't want to play
You're my obsession, I just can't get you out of my mind
I look around and I see all the signs
They say danger
I know you're gonna take me down to the darkness
Down to the darkness
Oh, but I want you to
I know you're gonna take me down to the darkness
Down to the darkness
Oh, but you know I want you to
Oh, yes I want you to
I'm afraid of the dark
Oh, but I'm attracted to it
I'm afraid of the dark
I want to run away, but I can't do it
Through my hazy confusion
I close my eyes, but your image is indelibly burned there
Seared into my memory 
Now as I stand on the edge of the precipice
Looking down into the black abyss
I know I'll be lost with just one kiss
But I want to be
Even as the tongues of fire lick at me from below
No turning back, I just can't let go of the danger
I know you're gonna take me down
I know you're gonna take me down to the darkness
Oh, but I want you to
I know you're gonna take me down to the darkness
Oh, down to the darkness
Oh, but you know I want you to
Oh, yes I want you to
I want you to take me down to the darkness
Down, down, down to the darkness
