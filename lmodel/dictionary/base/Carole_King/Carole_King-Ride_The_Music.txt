<song artist="Carole_King" title="Ride_The_Music">
Wouldn't you like to come with me
On a regular old fashioned fantasy
Let the music come and get you along
Let your mind just wander
Do you wanna go for a ride
Let out the secrets you're keepin' inside
It's a miracle to just be alive
Come on, come on, come on ride the music

There's no magic or mystery
You've gotta give yourself a break occasionally
And let the music come and get you along
Come on, come on, come on ride the music
