<song artist="Carole_King" title="Midnight_Flyer">
The flashing neon excites my blood
Breathing in the carnival air
That old street of dreams has got my head spinning
Being there at the pleasure fair
I'm no stranger to danger
He's been my lifelong friend
I can feel the pulse of the city
Who knows how it will end
Midnight flyer, higher and higher
And the sun won't rise till five
And I don't care if I'm spending my money
At least I feel alive
Midnight flyer
Suburban village has gone to sleep 
But I'm just waking up
The night holds a promise I intend to keep
To fill my loving cup
I know it's a long shot
But tonight I'm gonna take a chance
I can feel the rhythm of the city
It's my turn to dance
Midnight flyer, higher and higher
And the sun won't rise till five
I don't care if I'm spending my money
At least I feel alive
Midnight flyer, I'm on fire
Nothin's gonna stand in my way
I'm gonna keep on moving to the beat of the city
Until the break of day
Midnight flyer, I'm on fire
Midnight flyer, I'm on fire
Nothin's gonna stand in my way
Midnight flyer
