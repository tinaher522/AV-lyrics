Words and Music by 
Carole King, Carole Bayer Sager &amp; Babyface 
The sun is shining but not on me
Another lonely day
What's the use in making plans 
When nothing's gonna go my way
But there's a voice down deep inside me telling me what to say
[Chorus] 
Don't you know that you can do anything
You can take anything and make it your own
Don't you know that you can do anything
And you don't have to do it alone
Searching for the girl I was 
When I was sure and strong
When everything was easier 
And I could do no wrong
If I could only believe in myself 
I know I could find a way
[Chorus]
Sorry tears in my eyes
Got me down in confusion and doubt
Suddenly I realize 
I'm no different than anyone working it out
We're all working it out
[Chorus]
The sun is shining but not on me
Another lonely day
What's the use in making plans 
When nothing's gonna go my way
But there's a voice down deep inside me telling me what to say
[Chorus] 
Don't you know that you can do anything
You can take anything and make it your own
Don't you know that you can do anything
And you don't have to do it alone
Searching for the girl I was 
When I was sure and strong
When everything was easier 
And I could do no wrong
If I could only believe in myself 
I know I could find a way
[Chorus]
Sorry tears in my eyes
Got me down in confusion and doubt
Suddenly I realize 
I'm no different than anyone working it out
We're all working it out
[Chorus]
