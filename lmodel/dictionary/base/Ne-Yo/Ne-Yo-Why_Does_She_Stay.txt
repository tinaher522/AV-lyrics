<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Why_Does_She_Stay">
Why does she stay.......mmmmmmm 
Why does she stay......hey.....mmmmmmm 
Why does she stay......heyyy.....mmmmmmm....uh 
She hates that i dont do dishes 
Even though i mess up the most 
And she begs me all the time to help her 
I know that i should but im lazy so i dont ( mmmm yeah ) 
She's always considering my feelings 
Thinkin of me before herself 
Most of the time im so damn selfish 
I dont even realize she treats me so well 
She's so much better than me 
Im so unworthy of her 
Ouhhhhh.....Why does she stay 
Why does she stay........why..... 

She hates that we dont spend much time ( ouwow ) 
We barely see each other at all ( ouwow ) 
She dont even nag me 'bout always working 
She just says i just wish every now and then that you'd call ( ouwow ) 
And i dont know why she's still here (mmm ouwow ) 
She could have any man that she wants 
I step outside of myself 
To see how much she loves me 
And all the things that i should do for her that i just dont...just dont... 
And i realize 
She's so much better than me ( so much better ) 
Im so unworthy of her ( so unworthy of her ) 
Ouhhhhh.....Why does she stay 
Why does she stay with me........tell me why....why why why... 

She's in love 
She's in love 
She's in love 
And i dont understand 
And i dont understand 
She's in love 
She's in love 
She's in love 
Gotta be a better man for her 
So i take my time and do what im suppose to do 
Because i just cant see my life without you 
Ohhh ohhhh yeahhhh 
Why does she stay 
She's so much better than me 
Im so unworthy of her 
Ouhhhhh.....Why does she stay 
Why does she stay.....tell me why...why why why 
Why does she stay 
Why does she stay
