Verse 1:
I'm in this restaurant bathroom (Bathroom)
Trynna call you (Call You)
Trynna figure out what kindda lie to tell
At the table, sits a sexy little something I just met
And I don't know that well
I'm knowing its wrong
But I don't give a damn
That I got you sitting at home
Thinking that your man is out workin'
And doing right by you
Not thinking that someday it would all catch up to me
Hook:
People used to say you've got a good girl at home
You should really stop runnin
But I wasn't trynna hear 'em no
What about when she finds out
And leaves you all alone (Whatever)
Tell me what you gon' do then
I just turn and say
Don't worry me now
Chorus:
Oh, let me cross that bridge (Oh)
When I come to it
Said don't worry me now (No no)
Oh, let me cross that bridge
When I come to it (Said when I come to it yeah)
Used to think it could never happen to me (Never happen to me)
I'd just throw up my hands and say
Don't worry me now (Now, now now)
Oh, let me cross that bridge
When I come to it
Verse 2:
You're sittin on the couch cryin (Cryin')
Cuz I've been lyin (Lyin')
About the folks I kicked it with
And where I've been (Yeah)
I just walked in (Walked in)
Its six o'click in the morning
I smell like a cheap strip club (I know I ain't right)
And I know I ain't right to be sneakin
And take advantage of the fact that you believe
Because you love me (So I tell a few lies)
Then I turn around and do it all again the next time
Hook:
People used to say you've got a good girl at home (Oh)
You should really stop runnin
But I wasn't trynna hear it
What about when she finds out
And leaves you all alone (Finds out and leaves you alone)
Tell me what you gon' do then
I just turn and say don't worry me now
Chorus:
Oh, let me cross that bridge (Yeah)
When I come to it
Said don't you worry me now
Oh, let me cross that bridge (Oh)
When I come to it (When I come to it yeah)
Used to think it could never happen to me (Never happen to me)
I'd just throw up my hands and say
Don't worry me now
Oh, let me cross that bridge
When I come to it (Come to it, yeah)
Bridge:
I used to sit back thinking
I'd never get caught (Caught)
Every night I swelled up
Believing she'd bought
Then I, slipped up playin my game (Hey)
And baby got smart (Ohh)
This playa got caught up (Caught up, up)
And sure enough
She's gone (Gone)
As I sit here by my self, thinking to myself
(Damn I really miss her)
Maybe I should have listened (Oh)
Instead of frontin and trippin (Yeah)
Talkin bout don't worry me now (No)
Chorus:
Oh, let me cross that bridge (When I come to it)
When I come to it (Come to it, yeah)
Oh, let me cross that bridge (No, hey)
When I come to it (When I come)
Used to think it could never happen to me (Never happen to me)
I'd just throw up my hands and say (Don't worry me now, no)
Oh, let me cross that bridge
When I come to it (Oh)
Oh, let me cross that bridge
When I come to it (It can happen to you)
Oh, let me cross that bridge
When I come to it
Used to think it could never happen to me
I'd just throw up my hands and say..
Oh, when I cross that bridge...
