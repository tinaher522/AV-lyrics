<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Don't_Work_That_Way">
(VERSE 1)
She was a diamond princess cut perfect no cloud 
Sexy and independent, making man proud 
Oh but a man didnt no her work treating her wrong foul
Since he didnt know how to treat her 
She went an found a fellow that knew how (hoowww)
And he treats her like a queen, with a diamond crown (Yeah)
She's all happy now (Oh)
But looks who's back around (Yeah, Yeah)
Her old boyfriend and now he's talking bout (what he talking bout)
How he got it figured out 
He says leave him and let's work it out
But she said
Chorus 
No No No 
No No It Don't work that way 
No No It Don't work that way at all 
No No No 
No No It Don't work that way 
No No It Don't work that way at all 
(VERSE 2)
And so the old boyfriend stands there looking so confused
I guess he really thought she would pick him over her new dude
So he goes what can he give that i can't give you
She says great sex ain't one credit and occasional bag and a pair of shoes
She says he treats me like a queen, with a diamond crown (No)
I'm so happy now (happy now)
Then you come back around (then you come back around)
Say you didn't know then, but you swear that you know now
(but you swear that you know now)
Flashing that fake smile (Hey, hey)
Talking bout let's work it out (Woo, woo)
She said
Chorus 
No No No 
No No It Don't work that way
No No It Don't wotk that way at all
No No No 
No No It Don't work that way
No No It Don't wotk that way at all
La La La 
La La La La La La La
La La La La La La La La La
La La La 
La La La La La La La
La La La La La La La La La
Chorus
No No No 
No No It Don't work that way
No No It Don't wotk that way at all
No No No 
No No It Don't work that way
No No It Don't wotk that way at all
