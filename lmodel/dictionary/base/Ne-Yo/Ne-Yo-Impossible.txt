<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Impossible">
She took a fall it was crucial
Counted her out before they gave her a chance
(To get up)
The underdog, same as usual
Everyones watching and the pressure, it just won't let up
Tell me, I wantcha to, I wantcha to think that I
(Drowning in myself)
But baby no
(Noo)
After what I've been through
Lesson learned, story told, I know that
Nothing is impossible
Can't stop, won't stop, never gonna let it go
See baby, now I know
Nothing is impossible
Can't stop, won't stop, never gonna let it go
Takin' back my self control
Nothing is impossible
Nothings Impossible
Impossible
Impossible
Nothin' is impossible
Nothings Impossible
Impossible
Impossible
Nothin' is impossible
Difficulties, her position
(What she gonna do makes, blown all outa context)
Simple mistakes, crucifiction
Everyones watchin' and the pressure, just what you'd expect
Tell me, I wantcha too, I wantcha to think that I
(Drowning in myself)
But baby no
(Noo)
After what I've been through
Lesson learned, story told, I know that
Nothing is impossible
Can't stop, won't stop, never gonna let it go
See baby, now I know
Nothing is impossible
Can't stop, won't stop, never gonna let it go
Takin' back my self control
Nothing is impossible
Oooooaaaa
Humans are bad I can be
(Nobody's perfect, especially me)
Oooo
What you get is what you see
(Not gonna let it, steal a thing from me)
From me, from me, in perfect little me
Can't stop, won't stop, never gonna let it go
See baby, now I know
Nothing is impossible
Can't stop, won't stop, never gonna let it go
Takin' back my self control
Nothing is impossible
Can't stop, won't stop, never gonna let it go
See baby, now I know
Nothing is impossible
Can't stop, won't stop, never gonna let it go
Takin' back my self control
Nothing is impossible
Nothings Impossible
Impossible
Impossible
Nothin' is impossible
Nothings Impossible
Impossible
Impossible
Nothin' is impossible
