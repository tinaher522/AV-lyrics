<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="She_Got_Her_Own_(Miss_Independent_Remix)">
A dedication to the independent woman
To the one working hard for hers
That is just my way to let you know, I see you, baby
And I brought a friend along
To help me show my appreciation the right way
Ladies, Mr. Jamie Foxx, Mr. Foxx, ladies
I love her 'cause she got her own
She don't need mine, so she leave mine alone
There ain't nothin' that's more sexy
Than a girl that want, but don't need me
Young independent, yeah, she work hard
But you can tell from the way that she walk
She don't slow down 'cause she ain't got time
To be complaining, shawty gon' shine
She don't expect nothin' from no guy
She plays aggressive, but she's still shy
But you never know her softer side
By lookin' in her eyes
Knowing she can do for herself
Makes me wanna give her my world
Only kinda girl I want
Independent queen workin' for her throne
I love her 'cause she got her own
She got her own
I love her 'cause she got her own
She got her own
I love it when she say
It's cool, I got it, I got it, I got it
I love it when she say
It's cool I got it, I got it, I got it
I love her 'cause she got her own
She don't need mine, so she leave mine alone
There ain't nothin' that's more sexy
Than a girl that want, but don't need me
Lovely face, nice thick thighs
Plus she got drive that matches my drive
Sexy thing, she's mcfly
All the while payin' the bills on time
She don't look at me like, captain save 'em
Gold diggin', no, she don't do that
Now she lookin' me like inspiration
She wanna be complimentin' my swag
And everythin' she got, she work for it, good life made for it
She take pride in sayin' that she paid for it
Only kinda girl I want
Independent queen workin' for her throne
I love her 'cause she got her own
She got her own
Oh, I love her 'cause she got her own
She got her own
Hey, I love it when she say
It's cool, I got it, I got it, I got it
Ohh, she sayin'
She got it, I got it, I got it
Don't make me laugh, boo, never did that bad, too
Make you even have to but even if I had to
Ask my better half to, you be more than glad to
When I do that math, boo, you always try to add two
I need someone who'd ride for me
Not someone who'd ride for free
She said, boy, I don't just ride
She'll pull up beside of me
I had to ask her what she doin' in that caddy
She said, 'cause you my baby
I'd be stuntin' like my daddy
And there's not many, who catch my eye
We both wearing Gucci, she match my fly
And that's why, I suppose to keep her closer
Right by the side, toast and to host her
And that she went low so, case you didn't know so
You can save your money, dawg, shawty getting dough so
What she care with his cars, you can call her Miss. Boss
I got it backwards, criss cross, shawty got her own
Now all my ladies that don't need a man for nothing
Except some of that good lovin'
Let me hear you say ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Now my fellas know you need to stop the frontin'
If you lovin' independent woman
Let me hear you say ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I love her' cause she got her own
Got her own
Hey, I love her 'cause she got her own
She got her own
I love it when she say
It's cool, I got it, I got it, I got it
I love it when she say
Ohh, I got it, I got it, I got it
