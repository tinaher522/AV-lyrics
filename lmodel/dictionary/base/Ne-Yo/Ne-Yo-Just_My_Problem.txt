<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Just_My_Problem">
For some its easy
To know exactly
Where u wana be
Finding that someone
And u and that someone
Livin happily
I found that in you
Or i thought i did
But baby lately
Less than temptaations
Been tryna
Get the best of me
Am i in love
With you and no one else
Im jus not sure babe
Or am i just
Afraid of missin out
I jus dont kno
Is it not the right time
For u and me
And if its not when will be
Just cant make up my mind
Do i wana play
Or love u exclusively 
Thats just my problem
I want u but i jus cant decide babe
Thats just my problem
I love u but i need to figure this out babe
Thats just my problem
Said i wana be true to u
Thats just my problem
I guess ill get it right one day
When we're alone everythings cool
Cant think of no one that id rather be with
Than u
But baby when i take u out
And get to lookin round
I start havin doubts
Id rather break it off 
Than do u wrong
Id rather let u go 
Than string u along babe
N every time i think i kno whut i want
Baby i look in ur eyes
N its the same old song
Am i in love
With you and no one else
Im jus dont kno
Or am i just
Afraid of missin out
Im really not sure
Is it not the right time
For u and me
And if its not when will be
Just cant make up my mind
Do i wana play
Or love u exclusively 
Thats just my problem
I want u but i jus cant decide babe
Thats just my problem
I love u but i need to figure this out babe
Thats just my problem
Said i wana be true to u
Thats just my problem
I guess ill get it right one day
I cant do this to u
Its drivin u insane babe
I cant have ya
Waitin on me
Said its not fair babe
Said i jus need some time to figure out
Where it is
That i want to bee
Whooaaa
Thats just my problem
I want u but i jus cant decide babe
Thats just my problem
I love u but i need to figure this out babe
Thats just my problem
Said i wana be true to u
Thats just my problem
I guess ill get it right one day
U kno i want u but i cant
I cant
Said i need to figure this out baby
I wana be wit u
But im not sure
If i can be whut u want me to be baby
I jus need a little time babe
Just a little bit of time baby
Pleeease jus give me this time
N i swear that ill bee
Exactly whut u need babe
