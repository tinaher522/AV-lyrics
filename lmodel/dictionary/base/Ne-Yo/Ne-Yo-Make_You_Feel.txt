<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Make_You_Feel">
Wanna make you say oh, oh, oh, oh ,ooh ,oh, oh, oh, oh, oh ,oh, oh, ooh, oh, oh, oh. 
Say I don't know no magic tricks (oh no)
No baby that ain't me
But i always know the spot to hit,(oh yeah)
Said i can guarantee
Ima make you scream my name (maybe)
Holla "ooh baby"
Have you walkin' round feelin like a new lady 
But i don't need ninety-nine positions
To give you what i know you' been missin babe
'Stead of trying to impress,
Imma make you feel good
'Stead of trying to prove that im the best
I'll just make you feel good
Feel good baby
Let them young boys toss you all ova the room
Ima lay you down, keep it nice and smooth
Baby no extra, no stress,
I'll just make you feel good
Yeah yeah yeah
Baby im a grown ass man(oh yeah)
No i aint testing you(doing the motions)
And im not about too hurt myself(oh no)
On impressing you(looking out for us both girl)
From the counter in the kitchen,bathroom on the floor
All i wanna know is what the hell for
You been with young bucks trying to make up
For the things that they just cant doo
'Stead of trying to impress,
Imma make you feel good
'Stead of trying to prove that im the best
I'll just make you feel good
Feel good baby
Let them young boys toss you all ova the room
Ima lay you down, keep it nice and smooth
Baby no extra, no stress,
I'll just make you feel good
Yeah yeah yeah
Many positions, that aint my mission
I can get it done in one or maybe two
No need to flex girl, its only sex girl
Aint we suppose too both have fun
I can break you off and you be able to walk in the morning
So you can go to work
No we both only bounce of alone
Girl let me do you like I should
Just wanna make you feel good
'Stead of trying to impress,
Imma make you feel good
'Stead of trying to prove that im the best
I'll just make you feel good
Let them young boys toss you all ova the room
Ima lay you down, keep it nice and smooth
Baby no extra, no stress,
I'll just make you feel good
Yeah yeah yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh, oh, oh, oh, wanna make you feel good,
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh,oh, said just wanna make you feel good
Oh oh oh oh ooh, oh, oh,just wanna make you feel good
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh ooh,oh, oh, oh.
