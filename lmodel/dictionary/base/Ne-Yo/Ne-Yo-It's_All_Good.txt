Ne-Yo
Okay, bad day got you seeing red
Wanted to feel the sun on your back
But it rained on your head instead
But on the bright side, despite this hassle
Wet sand makes for a better sandcastle
Inhale, exhale, just take a breath
I know that things don't always happen like they should
Gotta learn to roll with the punches
And just say it's all good
Ne-Yo &amp; Cher Lloyd
'Cause it's like falling down
When everyone's watching
In the final round, fight your hardest but lose
It's like shouting out, when nobody can hear you
But when it's all said and done, it's all good
Wooo
It's all good
Wooo
It's all good
Cher Lloyd
Woke up on the wrong side of the bed
Gotta get the work done and then some,
got a busy day ahead
But on the bright side, work hard, play harder
Tomorrow's full of laughter
Inhale, exhale, just take a breath
I know that things don't always happen like they should (No)
Gotta learn to roll with the punches
And just say it's all good
Ne-Yo &amp; Cher Lloyd
'Cause it's like falling down
When everyone's watching
In the final round, fight your hardest but lose
It's like shouting out, when nobody can hear you
But when it's all said and done, it's all good
Wooo
It's all good
Wooo
It's all good
Said it's all good
It's all good
It's all good
Said it's all good
It's all good
It's all good
Ne-Yo
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah
There'll be bumps in the road
Things will go out of control
But you can't let it get you down
When your right just goes wrong
Just often keep pushing on
It's all good
Claim it here and now
Ne-Yo &amp; Cher Lloyd
'Cause it's like falling down
When everyone's watching
In the final round, fight your hardest but lose
It's like shouting out, when nobody can hear you
But when it's all said and done, it's all good
Wooo
It's all good
Wooo
It's all good
It's all good
It's all good
