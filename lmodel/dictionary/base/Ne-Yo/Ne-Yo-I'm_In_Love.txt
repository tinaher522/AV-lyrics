<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="I'm_In_Love">
No tears, no tears no more done cryin' now
No pain no pain, said i found another way
No games, not like before not up here on this cloud 
No time for yesterday, now let me explain it
Got a new woman, lovin me in every way that she can, 
All she wanna be is part of my plan, 
Safe to say that im in a better way, better way hey
Got a new woman loves to walk around just holdin my hand
Cupid must have found us now i like that
Lovin this woman 
Does anybody understand 
That i'm in love (love love) 
And i think i found the real thing (real love)
Gotta love to make ur heart say (lovelove)
You got me singin' lalalalala
Said i'm in love (love love) 
And i think i found the real thing (real love)
Kind of love to make ur heart say(lovelove)
You got me singin' lalalalalalalala im in love
No stress, no fuss, no fight when i'm in her arms
No time no day no night (no nothin better noo)
So much more than okay, life is made of this
No her, no me , no way
Now let me explain
Got a new woman, lovin me in all every way
That she can, all she wanna be is 
Part of my plan, safe to say that im in a better way 
Better way hey
Got a new woman loves to walk around just holdin my hand
Cupid must have found us now i like that 
Lovin this woman 
Does anybody understand 
That i'm in love (love love) 
And i think i found the real thing (real love)
Gotta love to make ur heart say(lovelove)
You got me singin' lalalalala
Said i'm in love (love love) 
And i think i found the real thing (real love)
Kind of love to make ur heart say(lovelove)
You got me singin' lalalalalalala
I want the whole damn world to know 
Sure as the wind blows
Carry the message, far as it can go
Man i'm in love 
Summer time or winter's cold
Nothin that can hold back this feelin
True love in which we're dealin baby
I i i i'm in love i i i i'm in love 
Does anybody understand i'm in love
And i think i found the real thing (real love)
Kind of love to make ur heart say(lovelove)
You got me singin' lalalalalala
I'm in love
And i think i found the real thing (real love)
Kind of love to make ur heart say(lovelove)
You got me singin' lalalalalalala
Lalalalala i'm in love
