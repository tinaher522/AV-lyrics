Now I Don't Wanna Jump The Gun
Or Misunderstand Anyone But
I Think Maybe You Have Been Feeling Something Lately
I Know We Got An Understanding
You Ain't My Girl, I Ain't Your Man
But I Think Maybe You Have Been Feeling This Thing Changing
The Feelings I Got For You
Couldn't Dry It's The Truth
But You Want Something New Baby
We Got A Simple Thing
But It's About To Change 
Or Will It Stay The Same Maybe
No Matter What The Road Iv'e Passed 
Still Has A Load Of Loves And Lusts 
And Not Much Trust
But Are You Saying This Can't Be Us
Let Me Get This Right
Girl You Want Us To Be
Official Make This Thing For Real
You For Real?
Baby Let Me Know
Let Me Get This Right
You Want To Make Me The Happiest
Man In The World
Is That The Deal?
Girl Foreal?
Baby Please Be Sure
Let Me Get This Right
I Know I Heard Ya
But Come Again Please
It's What I Want, Exactly What I Need
Are To Believe That We're Both On The Same Page
Threw Away My Black Book
Think I'm Done With That Look
You Took Long Enough To Come Into My Life
Are You Feeling What I Feel Girl?
The Feelings I Got For You
Couldn't Dry It's The Truth
But You Want Something New Baby
We Got A Simple Thing
But It's About To Change 
Or Will It Stay The Same Maybe
No Matter What The Road I've Passed
Still Has A Load of Loves And Lust
And Not Much Trust
But Are You Saying This Can't Be Us
Let Me Get This Right
Girl You Want Us To Be
Official Make This Thing For Real
You For Real?
Baby Let Me Know
Let Me Get This Right
You Want To Make Me The Happiest
Man In The World
Is That The Deal?
Girl Foreal?
Baby Please Be Sure
Let Me Get This Right
Let Me Get This Right
Girl You Want Us To Be
Official Make This Thing For Real
You For Real?
Baby Let Me Know
Let Me Get This Right
You Want To Make Me The Happiest
Man In The World
Is That The Deal?
Girl Foreal?
Baby Please Be Sure
Let Me Get This Right
