<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Forbidden_Fruit">
Stop me before i do something dumb, like fall in love with you.
You kiss me once and i stand there stunned, i don't wanna break loose baby,
 never wanna break loose baby.
I'd be a fool to think i was the only one, i know you've got a few.
So i try not to involve my emotions, but its just no use baby, 
everything that you do makes me just want you more.
Baby when i look at you, i just want you more.
When you touch me like you do, i just want you more.
Baby baby, you're forbidden fruit and the fact that i can't have you, 
just makes me want you more.
You are temptation in everyday, you smile at me and ooh.
When you're around i just cant behave, i don't wanna break loose baby, 
even though i need to baby.
I'd be a fool to think i was the only one, i know you've got a few.
So i try not to involve my emotions, but its just no use baby,
everything that you do makes me just want you more.
Baby when i look at you, i just want you more.
When you touch me like you do, i just want you more.
Baby baby, you're forbidden fruit and the fact that i can't have you, 
just makes me want you more.
And the saddest part of this, i know that you're no good for me.
Ooh, but i just can't resist, baby what you do,
baby you're forbidden fruit.
Baby when i look at you, i just want you more.
When you touch me like you do, i just want you more.
Baby baby, you're forbidden fruit and the fact that i can't have you, 
just makes me want you more x2
And the fact that i cant have you, 
just makes me want you more.
