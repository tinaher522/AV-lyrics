<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="So_You_Can_Cry">
So it's over 
He's with someone else and you know her 
And you just can't get any lower 
You sit in the dark alone 
Won't answer your phone 
Well I'm sorry 
I wont attend your pity party 
I rather go have calamari 
And maybe a drink 
And yes I think 
You should come with me 
Life is long 
There will be pain but life goes on 
With everyday a brand new song 
But if you rather stay at home 
Let me do you a favor 
I'll ask the sun to shine away from you today so you can cry 
(If that's what you want, alright) 
I'll ask the clouds to bring the rain for you today so you can cry 
(If that's what you want, alright) 
ooooo If that's what you want, alright 
I'm a Lover 
And the pain of a heart from another 
Can be difficult to recover 
Yes this I know 
But difficult isn't impossible 
And you shiver (shiver) 
He was your warmth 
You Cry Lips Quiver 
Well honey go on cry me a river 
You wanna be down (you wanna be down) 
Fine let me help you out 
How bout 
I'll ask the sun to shine away from you today so you can cry 
(If that's what you want, alright) 
I'll ask the clouds to bring the rain for you today so you can cry 
(If that's what you want, alright) 
ooooo If that's what you want, alright 
Then that what you want alright 
And your tears won't bring him back 
I know you wish that it did 
But it just don't work like that 
Ooo I know that healings takes time 
Hey, even your heart has a pace 
Ooo but how much time are you gonna take 
Hmm too much will be a mistake 
I'll ask the sun to shine away from you today so you can cry 
(If that's what you want, alright) 
I'll ask the clouds to bring the rain for you today so you can cry 
(If that's what you want, alright) 
I'll ask the sun to shine away from you today so you can cry 
If that's what you want
