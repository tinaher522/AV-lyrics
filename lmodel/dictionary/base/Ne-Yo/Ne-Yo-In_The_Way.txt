Ne-Yo - In The Way
lyrics by脚本小子
Thought I get to see your face again
But my flight got cancelled wouldnt stop raining
So two days three flights later I touchdown
But there was trouble with you family
and now your outta town
And I don't like it no this aint cool
Feelin like theres something just dont want me near you
The world keeps getting in the way
Trying to get to you but it seems like
everyday is something new
Baby the world keeps getting in the way
With you is where I wanna be but it just wont let me
Cuz it keeps getting in the way
Keeps getting in the way
Said it keeps getting in the way
Keeps getting in the way
Keeps getting in the way
Said it keeps getting in the way
And now were in the same state
But I be in the studio workin extra late(5 in the morning)
And finally I get to leave (im comin home to you)
But by the time I get there your already fast asleep
And I don't like it no this aint cool
Feelin like theres something just dont want me near you
The world keeps getting in the way
Trying to get to you but it seems like
everyday is something new
Baby the world keeps getting in the way
With you is where I wanna be but it just wont let me
Cuz it keeps getting in the way
Keeps getting in the way
Said it keeps getting in the way
Keeps getting in the way
Keeps getting in the way
Said it keeps getting in the way
Keeps getting in the way
Said it keeps getting in the way
Keeps getting in the way
Keeps getting in the way
Said it keeps getting in the way
And I don't like it no this aint cool
Feelin like theres something just dont want me near you
Baby The world keeps getting in the way
Trying to get to you but it seems like
everyday is something new
Baby the world keeps getting in the way
With you is where I wanna be but it just wont let me
Said it keeps getting in the way
Keeps getting in the way
Said it keeps getting in the way
Keeps getting in the way
Keeps getting in the way
Said it keeps getting in the way
Keeps getting in the way
Said it keeps getting in the way
Keeps getting in the way
Said it keeps getting in the way
Keeps getting in the way
Said it keeps getting in the way
Keeps getting in the way
