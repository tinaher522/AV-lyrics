Hmm...
(Aww Baby)
{VERSE 1}:
Said the words, played the part, gave the world and plus my heart, did it all with a smile on my face.
Gave you love, mind and soul, though that it was mutual, I see now that that wasn't the case.
(Look At Me Now)
Not exactly who I was or when you last saw me, baby I've grown into a man, who knows the deal.
(Playing around)
But my emotion is a thing of the past, sorry, said I've become a bit too slick, and that's for real!
(CHORUS)
(I was in love)
Silly me, silly me, I was what you wanted me to be,(but not anymore)
(I was in love)
silly you, silly you, I refuse, to be your fool,(not anymore)
{VERSE 2}:
Sugar what's, with your eyes, why do you look so surprised, is it â€˜cause your game has no effect (girl it ain't working)
And I developed such a swagger, sharp as a dagger, and a, mind that just won't fall for it, yeah.
(look at me now)
Not exactly who I was or when you last saw me, baby I've grown into a man, who knows the deal, hey.
(Playing around)
But my emotion is a thing of the past, sorry, said I've become a bit too slick, and that's for real! Hey!
(CHORUS)
I bet you thought that, ooh, (I'd be nothing without you, as you can see I'm fine) Hey! So what you coming around for? Baby! (I don't need you anymore)
I Was In Love!
(CHORUS)
(Yeah, yeah I'm fine)
