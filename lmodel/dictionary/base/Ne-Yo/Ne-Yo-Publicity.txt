<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Publicity">
The art of voyeurism
I like to watch
Tell me if it hurts when I push
Tell me do you easily bruise?
Tell me do you mind if they look?
Watch me as I'm punishing you
Pleasure at the palm of my hand
Ecstasy I know how you'll shoo
Do you mind if this time we stand?
They'll see us better if we do
Let's put on a show
Featuring you and me
Let's put on a show
Let's get some publicity
Let's put on a show
I don't give a damn who sees
Lets put on a show
And get some publicity(publicity)
Sexy is the sun on your back
Sweating makes you shine beautifully
Only way to experience that
Is outside where somebody might see
I dare you to take off your clothes
I dare you to lay on the floor
They're gonna watch regardless you know
Let's give them something to watch for
Let's put on a show
Featuring you and me
Let's put on a show
Let's get some publicity
Let's put on a show
I don't give a damn who sees
Let's put on a show
And get some publicity(publicity)
Lalalalala...
Let's put on a show
Featuring you and me
Let's put on a show
Let's get some publicity
Let's put on a show
I don't give a damn who sees
Let's put on a show
And get some publicity(publicity)
Publicity Publicity Pub-
Lalalalala...
