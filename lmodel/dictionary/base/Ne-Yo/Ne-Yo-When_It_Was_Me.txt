<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="When_It_Was_Me">
Ooh, No
Yeah, yeah
She's got green eyes and she's 5?5?
Long brown hair all down her back
Cadillac truck, so the hell what
What's so special about that
She used to model, she's done some acting
So she weighs a buck of 5
And I guess she's alright
I fperfectiob is what you like
Ooh, ooh, and I'm not jealous, no I'm not
Ooh, ooh, I just want everything she's got
Ooh, ooh, you look at her so amazed
I remember way back when you used to look at me that way
Teel me what makes her so much better than me
What makes her just everything I can never be
What makes her your every dream and fantasy
Because I can't remember when it was me
And now you don't feel the same
I remember you would shiver every time I said your name
You said nothing felt as good as when you gaze into my eyes
Now you don't care I'm alive how did we let the fire die
Ooh, ooh, and I'm not jealous, no I'm not
Ooh, ooh, I just want everything she's got
Ooh, ooh, you look at her so amazed
I remember way back when you used to look at me that way
What makes her so much better than me
What makes her just everything I can never be
What makes her your every dream and fantasy
Because I can't remember when it was me
That made you smile, that made you laugh
Me that made you happier than you have ever been, oh me
That was you world, your perfect girl
Nothing about me has changed that's why I'm here wondering
What makes her so much better than me
What makes her just everything I can never be
What makes her your every dream and fantasy
Because I can't remember when it was me
What makes her so much better than me
What makes her just everything I can never be
What makes her your every dream and fantasy
Because I can't remember when it was me
When it was me
When it was me
When it was me
