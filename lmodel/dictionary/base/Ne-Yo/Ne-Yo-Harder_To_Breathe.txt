<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Harder_To_Breathe">
Breathe in breathe out?
Ohh baby the trouble that I wanna get into
(Come sit with me, baby, come sit with me)
Looking at you, baby, im curious about the way you move
(Come sit with me, the way you move, come sit with me)	
Something bout u that I want, so that I don't
I'm scared alone, I might go to you babay
Touch me anywere u want, ohh lets get it on
C?mon c?mon im getting inpatient	
I want you now and I refuse to wait
(So hard to breathe, babay, so hard to breathe)
When you look at me I hyperventilate
(So hard to breathe, babay, so hard to breathe)
Just say?Breathe in breathe out(?again)
Ohh babay you make me wanna take this off
(come sit with me,take it off, come sit with me)
Im in the mood babay wanna take you down somewere and break it off
(come sit with me, break it off, come sit with me)
Something bout u that I want, so that I don't
Im scared alone I might go to you babay
Touch me anywere u want, anywere you want, lets get it on
C?mon c?mon im getting inpatient	
I want you now and I refuse to wait
(So hard to breathe, babay, so hard to breathe)
When you look at me I hyperventilate
(So hard to breathe, babay, so hard to breathe)
Just was?Breathe in breathe out (?again)
Ohh why you in my mind
Well u know u need to stop wastin my time
I want it now and I can hardly wait
When you look at me I hyperventilate I cant escape no more
(breathe in breathe out?.)
I want you now and I refuse to wait
(so hard to breathe, babay, so hard to breathe)
When you look at me I hyperventilate
(so hard to breathe, babay, so hard to breathe)
Breathe in breathe out(?again)
