(yeah, yeah, yeah, mmm, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(yeah, mm)
(Hey)
Verse 1
I'm sittin with no one else
Sittin all alone when we catch eyes
Then suddenly he comes over and introduces himself (yeah)
Oo, Everything that I want to hear (yeah)
Mm that's exactly what he put in my ear
Gotta get you outta my head
Chorus
It feels like he's reading my mind,
Cause he's doing everything that I like
And no matter how hard I try
I can't seem to fight it
It feels like he's reading my mind
I can't hide it, I can't seem to fight it, I can't hide it
It feels like he's reading my mind
X2
Verse 2
He's lookin right through me
As if he knows what I am thinking
Oh trying to hard to hide it (yeah)
But everything he is, I like it
Gotta get you outta my head
Chorus
Bridge
Oo, some kinda magic I cant explain
My calm and cool, I cannot maintain
All that I know is when he looks at me
It feels like he's reading my mind
(yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(woah, woah, woah)
Chorus
