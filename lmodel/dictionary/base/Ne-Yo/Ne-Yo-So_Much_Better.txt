<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="So_Much_Better">
Iive washed my hands of this situation
Of this complication
That you call a relationship
Scrub these walls
Might even repaint them
Cuz your memories stained 'em
And this color just ain't it
Scratch that idea
Take this match right here
Watch it burn, burn
Cuz a loss in love is a lesson learned
Oh I'm so much better for it
I'm so much better for
Dusting you off my shoulders 
Knowing that I don't need you no more
I'm so much better for it
And I'm moving in and out my closet
And I'ma get rid of all this
Drama that you left in here
Oh you've been officially evicted
Cuz you just don't get it
So let me make it nice and clear
Baby no more games
Love and respect are two things you must earn, earn
Cuz a loss in love is a lesson learned
Oh I'm so much better for it
I'm so much better for
Dusting you off my shoulders 
Knowing that I don't need you no more
I'm so much better for it
I'm so much better for it
I'm so much better for
Dusting you off my shoulders 
Knowing that I don't need you no more
I'm so much better for it
???
???
Better for finally realizing the truth
That I can do so much better than you, woah
Woah, I'm so much better for it
I'm so much better for
Dusting you off my shoulders 
Knowing that I don't need you no more
I'm so much better
Woah, I'm so much better for it
I'm so much better for
Dusting you off my shoulders 
Knowing that I don't need you no more
I'm so much better for it
