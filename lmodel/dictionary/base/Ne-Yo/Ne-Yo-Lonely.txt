(Intro)
Ahhhhhhhhhhh
Ummmhummmmm
Dadadoooooooooo
Dadadoooooooooo
Da-da-doooooooooo
uh huh
(Verse 1)
42nd Street 4am Im rolling Slowly, No
Destination in mind 
Driver's Looking at me strange cause i got in.
Handed Him A Wad of Cash
Sat back and told him just drive.
Im thinking bout the day u packed your things and left.
Saying u knew all Shanelle, Tiffany Tracey, Stephanie
U went away so im writing in the fog from the window to express myself and how im feeling
(Hook)
Y. L. E. N. O. L.
As I roll past you in this taxi cab
If u care at all, That means Im Lonely.
OOOOooooOOOOOooooOOOO
Y. L. E. N. O. L.
As I roll past you in this taxi cab
If u care at all, That means Im Lonely.
(Verse 2)
I see a woman walking with her man (Man)
Man with his woman 
Smiling as they stroll into this little bar (bar)
As they kiss each other holding hands. I Get 
Sick to my stomach
So jealous of how happy they are
Lucky
There's A couple different people I could call right now.
But the one I want and don't want me at all right now
And That Hurts
Threw My Heart, My Mind And My Soul (Soul)
Rolling In This Cab Writing On The Window Singing

(Hook)
Y. L. E. N. O. L.
As I roll past you in this taxi cab
If u care at all, That means Im Lonely.
OOOOooooOOOOOooooOOOO
Y. L. E. N. O. L.
As I roll past you in this taxi cab
If u care at all, That means Im Lonely. 
(Bridge)
(OoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooO)
(In The Background)
(Without Her)
What Am I Supoose To Do Now
Rolling Round Feeling Like A Fool Now
(Without Her)
Crying Like A Bitch In The Back Of This Taxi Cab
(Without Her)
So Listen To Me
Driver Trys To Ask If Im Alright I Say
Nevermind, Mind Your Business and Just Drive Damn It
(Without Her)
You Dont Know Nothing About
How I Feel Right Now
Let Me Spell It Out
(Without Her)
(Hook)
Y. L. E. N. O. L.
As I rode past you in this taxi cab
If u care at all, That means Im Lonely.
OOOOooooOOOOOooooOOOO
Y. L. E. N. O. L.
As I rode past you in this taxi cab
If u care at all, That means Im Lonely. (Sing Hook Twice)
Til Fade
