[ne-yo speaking]
Babe open up
Baby my key ain't workin, open up
Babe c'mon now its cold out here
Open the door
What??!....
She said I was where??!!.....
C'mon man..open the door
Why you trippin'?
[verse 1]
Baby c'mon now this is ridiculous
Why you got me out here in the cold?
What is you tripping for?
I know you can hear me banging on your door
Ok, I'm guess that you then heard something
Somebody saw something 
One of your little friends hating on me
And you believing it
Girl whatever you wanna talk about
But can you let me in and maybe then kick me out
[bridge]
I've got my boys out
They laughing at me,
I look like a jerk
Baby you making me look bad.
Came home this evening 
And put in my key and it didnt work
You in the window looking at me
And I'm knock knocking
And I know that you in there
You wont even let me plead my case 
And that aint fair
It aint right that I'm
I'm outside, 
And I'm wondering where am i gonna sleep tonight
Oh
[chorus]
Let me in girl, Let me in girl
What's this? Quit tripping 
And let me in girl
Let me in girl, 
You hear me knocking. What the hell is wrong with you?
You really really really need to stop
Its cold out here and that aint hot
So let me in
Let me in girl, let me in girl
Let me in girl, open the door
[verse 2]
Ok, its getting dark now
And you know this aint the safest hood
(**A lil crimy)
And if it goes down,
It aint gonna be nothing i can do 
No, that aint all good, no
Dont let me break it down
Hey, right off the hinges 
Tell me what i did
Your girl's lying
Give me a chance to make that clear
Open up the door before I loose it out here
Oh
[bridge]
I've got my boys out (hey)
They laughing at me,(whoo')
I look like a jerk
Baby you making me look bad.
Came home this evening (aww')
And put in my key and it didnt work(ahhhaa')
You in the window looking at me
And I'm knock knocking
And I know that you in there (oh')
You wont even let me plead my case 
And that aint fair

And I'm wondering where am i gonna sleep tonight

And let me in girl (lemme in girl)
