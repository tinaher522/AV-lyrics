<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Turn_It_Into_Love">
I see nothing but space and opportunity
I think we should take advantage  girl you and me
Ooh so simple so easy
All it takes is us
Help me take this party
And turn it into love
(Love)
Let's fall in love on this floor
Turn it into love (Love)
Dance till we can't dance no more
Turn it into love
Turn it to love 
Turn it into love ( hey)
Turn it to love ( yeah) 
This light inside of you
As your dancin
It shines so beautifully just like its supposed to
Said the world outside of this party
Doesn't worry us
Help me take that drama
And turn it into love
(Love)
Let's fall in love on this floor
Turn it into love ( Love)
Dance till we can't dance no more
Turn it into love 
Turn it to love 
Turn it into love (Hey)
Turn it to love( Yeah)
If it feels good move to it,
Dont't think about it do it,
Drop that drama don't hold on to it,
Put that down get up and do it. 
If it feels good move to it 
Don't think about it do it
Drop that drama don't hold on to it
Help me turn it into love
Let's fall in love on this floor
Turn it into love ( Love)
Dance till we can't dance no more
Turn it into love ( Ohhh)
Turn it to love ( Hey)
Turn it into love ( Hey Hey)
Turn it to love love love love loveee
Ooohh Hey
Turn it to love
Turn it into love
Oohh oohh yeeah
