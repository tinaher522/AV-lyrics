<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Sahara">
Yu yuh
Yuh
Uhhhhhh
Hey hey 
Hey hey
Good for 4 to 5
4 am she says
Ask what's good tonight
What about me and you?
Anything that cha like
For the right price
I'm yours tonight
Whooa
And normally  i
Don't get down like that
But she had something
Special
Big hips and thighs 
And big brown eyes
Compatible 
Jump in the whip let's go
Sahara
(chorus) Girl you too fine to  do the things you do 
Sahara! 
She bought that dose, 
Sahara! 
Girl why you do the things you do, do, do? 
She hopped in the ride
Oh
Said do you mine
If i set you up before we get there
Baby girl that's all right
Do what you like
Gotta watch the road
But all bout to explode
(bridge)  oh
She's crazy, her body,
Oh
It's so ridiculous
One night her  
Make you wanna wife her
But you can't do that 
Cause after you 
It's back to that track
Sahara
Girl you too fine to  do the things you do 
Sahara! 
She bought that dose, 
Sahara! 
Girl why you do the things you do, do, do? 
Sang it
Sahara
Girl you too fine to  do the things you do 
Sahara! 
She bought that dose, 
Sahara! 
Girl why you do the things you do, do, do? 
She's crazy, her body,
Oh
It's so ridiculous
One night her
Make you wanna wife her
Girl you too fine to  do the things you do 
Sahara! 
She bought that dose, 
Sahara! 
Girl why you do the things you do, do, do?
Girl you too fine to  do the things you do 
Sahara! 
She bought that dose, 
Sahara! 
Girl why you do the things you do, do, do?
Sahara sahara sahara sahara sahara
