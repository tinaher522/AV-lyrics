<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Yours">
I don't know what else you want me to do baby
I mean... I'm all yours (I'm all yours)
Maybe it's the way I tip my hat
That makes these broads be on me like that
But it seems no matter how
Many chicks that I turn down
You still think, I'm runnin 'round
(Damn baby)
It's who I am (baby)
(And I can't help it if I'm fly)
So what if I catch their eyes
The point is that I pass them by
(Damn baby)
How can I prove (baby)
That it's with you I'm tryna ride
Handcuff me to your right side
To show the whole world that I'm
Chorus
Yours
And I don't want nobody else (No, no)
So tell me what more can I do
To show that I'm ridin' wit you
Girl, I'm (I'm all yours)
Oooh Why you wanna listen to your friends
(Why, Why)
They just mad cause they ain't got no man
(Don't make no sense)
How they gon give you advice
How to keep yo thang tight
They can't get they own (s*!t) right
(No baby)
It's you and me (baby)
And we don't need no outside help
If you think I'm doing dirt
How about asking me first
(Please baby)
Learn to trust in me (baby)
Or you might end up by your self
I don't want us to go out like that
Girl I'm, 
Chorus
Yours
And I don't want nobody else (No, no)
So tell me what more can I do
To show that I'm ridin' wit you
Girl, I'm (I'm all yours)
Tellin my homies I can't roll wit cha'll too late at night
Letting you check my sidekick
Read the messages inside
Plus the fact I'm turnin down dime pieces left and right
All of this to let you know
Baby I'm yours
Tellin my homies I can't roll wit cha'll too late at night
Letting you check my sidekick
Read the messages inside
Plus the fact I'm turnin down dime pieces left and right
All of this to let you know
To show you I'm 
Chorus
Yours
And I don't want nobody else (No, no)
So tell me what more can I do
To show that I'm ridin' wit you
Girl, I'm (I'm all yours)
