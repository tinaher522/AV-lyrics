<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Because_Of_You_(Remix)">
(Verse One - Kanye West)
Yeezy, Ne-yo, the remix ayo
I think it's time to hit em with the Mase flow
My uh she was gettin the best of me
But oooh child you my destiny
and I know it's especially
hard with all these girls just testin me
uh and you gon question me
if she even stand next to me
but you should laugh
cuz u my better half
and these girls just fightin over the rest of me
right now it feels so crazy
I know she just some lady
and my outfit just so 80's
not to mention my car my mercedes
and the 26 inch rim wheels
looks so good with your 6-inch heels
fly that you be on gone
gucci on
aligned by Louie Vuitton
and we hot as the way we cruisin on
highlight I like mercury
Why do I mention the solar system?
cuz you in my soul and system
and we gon take her home wit this one
I got somethin that you gon like
you got somethin that I can't fight
we got somethin that we both gon right
(Chorus)

And I know this much is true
Baby, you have become my addiction, I'm so strung out on you
I can barely move but I like it
And it's all because of you (x3)
And it's all because...
Never get enough,
She's the sweetest drug
(Verse 2 - Ne-Yo)
Think of it every second
I can't get nothing done,
Only concern is the next time, I'm gonna get me some
Know I should stay away from, cause it's no good for me
I try and try but my obsession wont let me leave
(Hook)
I got a problem and I don't know what to do about it
Even if I did, I don't know if I would quit but I doubt it
I'm taken by the thought of it
(Chorus)
(Bridge)
Ain't no doubt, so strung out (x2)
Over you, over you, over you
(Outro)
Because of you,
And it's all because of you,
Never get enough
She's the sweetest drug, she's the sweetest drug
