<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Single">
If you came here by yourself tonight, 
Cause he wouldn't pick up the phone. 
He was supposed to bring you here tonight, 
Couldn't find him so you came alone. 
It don't matter cause you're here now 
And the music you're enjoyin, 
So for the next couple minutes, 
Baby I'ma be your boyfriend. 
Pretty mama if you're single, single, 
You don't gotta be alone tonight. 
So while the DJ play this single, single, 
Just pretend that I'm your man tonight. 
So you don't gotta be alone, I'll be your boyfriend. 
So you don't gotta be alone, girl I'll be your boyfriend. 
So you don't gotta be alone, baby I'll be your boyfriend. 
Be your boyfriend till this song goes on. 
So you don't gotta be alone, I'll be your boyfriend. 
So you don't gotta be alone, girl I'll be your boyfriend. 
So you don't gotta be alone, baby I'll be your boyfriend. 
Be your boyfriend till this song goes on. 
Be your boyfriend till this song goes on. 
He don't tell that you're beautiful, 
Let me tell it you to the beat. 
He don't tell you that he loves you girl, 
Let me sing it in a harmony. 
Let my song get you higher, 
We'd never have to come back down. 
And if you ever you should miss me, 
Just tell the DJ run it back now. 
Pretty mama if you're single, single, 
You don't gotta be alone tonight. 
So while DJ run this single, single, 
Just pretend that I'm your man tonight. 
So you don't gotta be alone, I'll be your boyfriend. 
So you don't gotta be alone, girl I'll be your boyfriend. 
So you don't gotta be alone, baby I'll be your boyfriend. 
Be your boyfriend till this song goes on. 
So you don't gotta be alone, I'll be your boyfriend. 
So you don't gotta be alone, girl I'll be your boyfriend. 
So you don't gotta be alone, baby I'll be your boyfriend. 
Be your boyfriend till this song goes on. 
Be your boyfriend till this song goes on. 
Be your boyfriend till this song goes on.
