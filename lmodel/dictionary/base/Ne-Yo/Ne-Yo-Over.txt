<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Over">
I don't need no apology, I don't need you to comfort me
Need no explaination as to why you played
And I don't need you to try no more, give me an excuse or lie no more
Matter of fact baby we have nothin more to say (oh)
Cos when a person makes the same mistakes over and over again
(they ain't learning no, they ain't learning no)
And when you put your heart where it don't belong
Normally it's you that winds up hurting (oh)
I've been burned before but not no more, I'm over
O-over
Said the burden of this love is off my shoulders
O-over
Now i found my smile again cos I'm so over
O-over
Now i can relax and watch my kids get older and wiser
Finally enjoy my life cos I'm so over
I can't blame you for anything
All you can do to me is what i let you do
No more baby i messed up bad, you talk real fast
I let you back to do the same thing again sugar i refuse
Cos when a person makes the same mistakes over and over again
(they ain't learning no, they ain't learning no)
And when you put your heart where it don't belong
Normally it's you winds up hurting (oh)
I've been burned before but not no more, I'm over
O-over
Said the burden of this love is off my shoulders
O-over
Now i found my smile again cos I'm so over
O-over
Now i can relax and watch my kids get older and wiser
Finally enjoy my life cos I'm so over
You can look at me and know for sure i don't hurt no more
I'm so happy with what I've become
Didn't know just what he had in store
Til i found the guide in me
O-over
Said the burden of this love is off my shoulders
O-over
Now i found my smile again cos I'm so over
O-over
Now i can relax and watch my kids get older and wiser
Finally enjoy my life cos I'm so over
O-over
Said the burden of this love is off my shoulders
O-over
Now i found my smile again cos I'm so over
O-over
Now i can relax and watch my kids get older and wiser
Finally enjoy my life cos I'm so over
