<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Get_Down_Like_That">
(Verse 1)
When I'm single it don't really matter who it is
Or how many I decide to kick it with
Long as she can understand how I do it
I'm a man with a very healthy appetite for chicks
But when I settle down find a woman to live for
Still may be a couple cuties at my door
Thinking we could get down like we did before
And get mad when I tell her
It can't be like that no more
(Bridge)
Girl, you know I got a girl
(Chorus)
I just don't get down like that
I don't get down like that
Baby you fine, baby you's a dime
But I just don't get down like that
I don't get down like that
(Verse 2)
Understand baby girl that I'm a totally new man
I don't live to crush as many as I can
No no
Found a girl that changed my whole game plan
She the one (she the one)
Only one that I'm wanting
And I know girl I know
That you really want me back
I'd be lying if I said I wasn't tempted
All the things we used to do I kinda miss it
It ain't nothing you can give as good as this is
(Girl)
(Bridge)
Girl, you know I got a girl
(Chorus)
I just don't get down like that
I don't get down like that
Baby you fine, baby you's a dime
But I just don't get down like that
I don't get down like that
(Baby)
(Verse 3)
Baby,
All I can say is I'm sorry
Since I found me my lady
To think about cheating would be crazy
Don't get down baby
All I can say is I'm sorry
Since I found me my lady
To think about cheating would be crazy
And I don't get down baby
(Bridge)
Girl, you know I got a girl
(Chorus)
I just don't get down like that
I don't get down like that
Baby you fine, baby you's a dime
But I just don't get down like that
I don't get down like that
You know I got a girl
