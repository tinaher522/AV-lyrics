<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="There_With_You">
Oh
La la la la la 
(Verse 1)
We Dance and sing
Somewhere in between
Heaven and Hell
Gabrielle that was her name
Everyone is smiling even through the tears
Under her spell, but in gabis eyes nothing
I ask: do you not like the music
She said: its all right
But she dances to her own sad tune
(Chorus)
She says: Take me away from here
Take me somewhere 
Where love is like breathing
I don't care where we go 
Long as I'm there with you
Long as I'm there with you
(Verse 2)
I Can Tell 
She's been through pain I can only Dream
Nightmares that live with you
Tears Well In her eyes
But she wouldn't let them fall
I give the world to know what her smile is
I Ask: will you dance with me now
Let me try to figure out
The fastest route out of town
She Smiles
(Chorus)
Take me away from here
Take me somewhere 
Where love is like breathing
I don't care where we go 
Long as I'm there with you (baby)
(Hook)
Oh
I got a full tank of gas
(Oh Oh OOH)
Anywhere you want to go
(OH oH OH)
All you have to do is ask Girl
OH
(Chorus)
She said: Take me away from here
She said: Take me somewhere 
Where love is like breathing
I don't care where we go 
Long as I'm there with you (Baby)
Take me away from here
She said: Take me somewhere 
Where love is like breathing
I don't care where we go 
Long as I'm there with you
