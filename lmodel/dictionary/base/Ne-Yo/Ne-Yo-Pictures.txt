<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Pictures">
Something I can't remember 
Something that I
Something I can't remember
[Verse 1]
Found a photo of our memory
That picture was hiding
Kind of like finding a treasure chest
With no treasure inside it
Have you noticed the bad memories
Seem to linger the longest
I remember the fights and the dreams
Those are the ones that I wanted
Now all I can say is
[Chorus]
I guess I should've took more pictures
Had I known that I wouldn't be with you today
I really would've took more pictures
Had I known you were going 
Going away 
Away
[Verse 2]
Didn't realize you were unhappy
To you I probably should've listened
Wasn't trying to be your enemy
Just wasn't paying attention
Now I can barely picture your face
Without tears in your eyes
Can't remember your kiss your embrace
But I remember you saying goodbye
Now all I can say is
[Chorus]
I guess I should've took more pictures
Had I known that I wouldn't be with you today
I really would've took more pictures
Had I known you were going 
Going away 
Away
[Verse 3]
Had I known the last time I saw your smile
Would be the last time I saw it at all
I would've captured the moment 
I would've held on forever
Now your smile I can barely recall
[Chorus]
I guess I should've took more pictures
Had I known that I wouldn't be with you today
I guess I should've took more pictures
Had I known that I wouldn't be with you today
I really would've took more pictures
Had I known you were going 
Going away 
Away
