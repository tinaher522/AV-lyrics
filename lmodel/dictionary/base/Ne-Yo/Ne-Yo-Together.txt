<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Together">
[Verse 1] 
Since the day that we met girl 
I've never had anyone make me feel this way 
And my heart is sure it wants to be with you 
Want to give you the whole worldohh 
If you make the promise to me, I'm gonna stay 
Without you guiding me, I'm lost and so confused 
[hook] 
What will it take to show you I'll be by you're side 
Cause I got you and I want to give you what you never had 
Girl everyday I hope to make you part of my life 
Cause you know me and I know you 
Girl your love is where its atohhh 
[chorus] 
I'm gonna be the love that's gonna last 
And be the one that got your back 
And nothing never that bad 
That we would be together 
And we both made a mistake 
And something never wished we made 
But we will be okay if we just stay together 
[verse 2] 
OoohI know he left you stranded 
And you paid the price when you messed up your life 
Girl I know you're so afraid but I can't write the wrong cd 
I know you saw the lipstick on my window 
And wonder how many chicks been to my home 
I done my share of playing games 
But for you I given up that life 
[hook] 
What will it take to show you I'll be by you're side 
Cause I got you and I want to give you what you never had 
Girl everyday I hope to make you part of my life 
Cause you know me and I know you 
Girl your love is where its atohhh 
(chorus) 
[verse 3] 
Baby you're the one I'm waiting for 
Because you give me what I needed more 
Cause its clear that we are meant to be 
Togethertogetherwe should be together 
Eternally.Ooohh 
And I'm gonna be. 
(chorus) x2
