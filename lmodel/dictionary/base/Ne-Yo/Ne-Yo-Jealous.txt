<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Jealous">
Oooh
Jealous of the way that dress is huggin' you
How it caresses your body as you move
So upset 'cause I wish I could touch you too
The things you make me wanna do
Oooh, baby
What I wouldn't give to be your shoe
Just so I could caress your feet
Don't have a clue
You're the instant of how much I'm feelin' you
Baby, won't you let me come and tell you 'bout it
Know that I could be that lipstick on your lips
Babe I wish I was that skirt that's 'round your hips
And I know it might sound funny when I tell you this
But everything that touches you has me so, jealous
Can't believe I'm envious of your Chardonnay (baby!)
Oh how I wish you would kiss me that way
I would let you drink from me any day
Oh how you hurt me baby
I don't wanna make you think I'm comfortably insane
I just like what I see
And I want it all for me baby
I'm goin' crazy!
Know that I could be that lipstick on your lips
I wish I could be that skirt that's 'round your hips
And I know it might sound funny when I tell you this
But everything that touches you has me so, jealous
And I may be a bit over protective
I'm okay with that
You got me and you and me and you
Ghettos and G's
I'm so on this love of mine
Know that I could be that lipstick on your lips
I wish I could be that skirt that's 'round your hips
And I know it might sound funny when I tell you this
But everything that touches you has me so, jealous
Know that I could be that lipstick on your lips
Babe I wish I was that skirt that's 'round your hips
And I know it might sound funny when I tell you this
But everything that touches you has me so, jealous
Know that I could be that lipstick on your lips
Babe I wish I was that skirt that's 'round your hips
And I know it might sound funny when I tell you this
But everything that touches you has me so, jealous
Know that I could be that lipstick on your lips
Babe I wish I was that skirt that's 'round your hips
And I know it might sound funny when I tell you this
But everything that touches you has me so, jealous
