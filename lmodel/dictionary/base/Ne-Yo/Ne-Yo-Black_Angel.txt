<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Black_Angel">
(feat. Jeff Jones)
Nights full of fears, eyes full of tears
Cus u been hearin the same lies for 5 years.
Fresh out of high school he pursued his career
And u played the house wife roll for dude and his kids
But now u can't get a break no matter how hard u try,
Your life's on the line everytime u start up the ride
Cus u never got ur L's but its hard not to drive
When ur baby got a cold and the car is outside
Plus the hospital is far and ur dude ran out on ya
Just because he said that u had a mouth on ya,
Becus u would scream and holla
When he walk up in the room with maybeline up on his collar
And he didn't even bother to consider his child
He said he'd always be around but what's so different now?
You stressin now cause u can figure it out
But keep ur head in the clouds girl
Continue to smile girl
Cus baby u are a
Black angel, Oh baby you are so fly
Black angel. Girl don't let him hold you down
Get up and just spread your wings and fly
Black angel
He swept u off your feet when u met it was love at first sight
He didn't even curse, said he was the Church type
Was almost Mr. Right until ur first fight
And u found out he was worse than ike
Cus he hit you in the face so hard that I hurt to bite
Now your uncertain of this person you liked
But you keep making excuses for him being abusive cause you want it to work this time
So you convince your mind that it fine
But in time your gonna find
That real love aint defined with violence
And if your crying every night
Just cause some guy decided its ahhite
To hit you in the eye then its time
That you learn from the mistakes
Of those that chose to stay
Cause most of em are gone today
And there's a gang of sistas
That would probably still be with us
If they would've just flown away Neyo gone and sang
You're fly
Black angel. Oh baby u are so fly
Black angel. Girl don't let him hold you down
Get up and just spread your wings and fly
Black angel
Babygirl stop depending on your man for love
And start depending on the man above
[Chorus]
