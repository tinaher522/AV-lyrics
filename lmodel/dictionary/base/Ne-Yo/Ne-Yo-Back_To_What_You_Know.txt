Oooo
La-di-da-la-la
Wooohhh woah woah
La-di-da-la-la
I don't know where to begin
Fighting a war I can't win
Fighting a memory
Something that use to be
Hmmm
No matter how hard I fight
All of my strength and my might
Keeps defeating me
It just keeps defeating me
Ummm
So what I'm trying to say
I know what's happening
Your body is here with me
But your heart and your mind is still with him
(Chorus)
Go back to what you know
Go back to where you know your heart is girl
Just be honest
(This is impossible)
This is impossible
We'll never work cause you don't want it girl
You belong with him so go back to what you know
oooo-oooo-ooo OOOOOOO oooo
oooo-oooo-ooo-OOOOOOO oooo
(Go back to what you know)
oooo-oooo-ooo-OOOOOOO oooo
oooo-oooo-ooo-OOOOOOO oooo
(Cause this is impossible)
Telling me things of you two
Killing me when he was with you
And how he was oh so sweet
The way that he use to treat you
(Seems you just can't) Keep him out of your mind
Obvious to me that I'm
Not where you want to be
Baby you don't want me
No no
So what I'm trying to say
I know whats happening
Your body is here with me
But your heart and your mind is still with him
(Chorus)
oooo-oooo-ooo OOOOOOO oooo
oooo-oooo-ooo-OOOOOOO oooo
(Go back to what you know)
oooo-oooo-ooo-OOOOOOO oooo
oooo-oooo-ooo-OOOOOOO oooo
(Cause this is impossible)
And if that's really what you want
I will not stand in your way
You Wanna be free
I will let you be
I'd rather you're happy
Then miserable with me
Back to what you know
oooo-oooo-ooo OOOOOOO oooo
oooo-oooo-ooo-OOOOOOO oooo
(Back to what you know)
oooo-oooo-ooo-OOOOOOO oooo
oooo-oooo-ooo-OOOOOOO oooo
(Said back to what you know)
(Chorus)
oooo-oooo-ooo OOOOOOO oooo
oooo-oooo-ooo-OOOOOOO oooo
(Back to what you know)
oooo-oooo-ooo-OOOOOOO oooo
oooo-oooo-ooo-OOOOOOO oooo
This is impossible
(Cause this is impossible)
Said ain't no way to make this last
You're stuck in the past
Pedal to the gas
And drive away
