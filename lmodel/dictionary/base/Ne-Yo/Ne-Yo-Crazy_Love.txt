<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Crazy_Love">
We're a hurricane
So destructive in the way that we do
A little bit insane
But she loves it just the same and me too
They say love and insanity
Are somewhat related, the way that they make us act
But baby girl, the love between you and me
Is truly the greatest though sometimes we hate it
They can't tell me nothing but not you
'Cause you're my crazy love
Can't tell me nothing 'bout how we do
We got crazy love
I'm intelligent, I'm not stupid, not at all
But my common sense, when it comes to you it falls
Then I do something dumb
They say love and insanity
Are somewhat related in the way that they make us act
But baby girl, the love between you and me
Is truly the greatest though sometimes we hate it
They can't tell me nothing but not you
You're my crazy love
Can't tell me nothing 'bout how we do, you and me, yeah
Crazy love
I walk into where you was at
Then my phone calls get a who is that
I told her that I worry that we won't last
She told me, you need to worry when I don't ask
See that's the crazy love I be talking 'bout
Gary Coleman face girl what you talking 'bout?
Make me wanna kick you and that yorkie out
Then I see that fat ass when you walking out
How I'm gonna tell my baby bye, bye
Outfit look crazy on her, you my Lady Gaga
But you wanna start it first and get the last word
You wanna lock me down and get the password
Damn, I wanna stray don't use juice
So in the bedroom I got a few screws loose
The head's coo coo, back shots psycho
Hit it from the back hard, hope you got Geico
They can't tell me nothing but not you
You're my crazy love
Can't tell me nothing 'bout how we do, you and me, yeah
Crazy love
