<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Ghetto_Love_Story">
(talking)
In the ghetto
Things dont always turn out the way
You would expect them to
Thats how it goes
Its real life
Check it
She was a brick house bangin
Ill shoe game and
No regular cat could get that
She only wanted two things
A puppy and a man that
Wanted more than to just hit that
Well out on the block (Â ??? )
What did she spot a
Pretty thug walkin a baby rot wiler
Pow 
They caught eyes 
It was love at first sight
Crazy how somethin that seems so right can go wroongg
See it didnt take too long
For her to see just what this dude was on
He was a good dude true and deep
But he liked to make his money runnin the street
So she hit him with its either the block or me
And the beautiful thing suddenly ugly
But thats how it goes
See that aint nothin but a ghetto love story
And in the ghetto
It doesnt always have a happy ending
But thats how it goes
See that aint nothin but a ghetto love story
And in the ghetto
It doesnt always have a happy ending
But thats how it goes
So she stay maintain and
She dont wana be alone
But every time he leave the house
She be worried bout 
If hes even gona come back home
It seems no matter what she say 
He must make that paper just
Gotta get his hustle on
But it hurts him to his heart cus his love is strong
And though hes tryna make things right for her
All she see's is wrong
All he can do is keep on
Cus she dont understand just what hes on
You see he loved her true and deep
But he had to make his paper in these streets
So she hit him with its either the block or me
And the beautiful thing suddenly ugly
But thats how it goes
See that aint nothin but a ghetto love story
And in the ghetto
It doesnt always have a happy ending
But thats how it goes
See that aint nothin but a ghetto love story
And in the ghetto
It doesnt always have a happy ending
