Think about it
You and me together
Lovin each other
Aimin at forever
Think about it
You and me together
Lovin each other babee
Think about it
You and me together

Aimin at forever
Think about it

Now i don't wanna scare you
Baby i just wana say
The little things you do for me
And the way

No other girl for me will do

Now i dont wana rush nothin baby just kno
When you say your ready to go we'll go
Two kids, a dog, the house and all
Tell me you see it babe

Not tryna move to fast
But i just gotta ask

And is it too soon
To look at you

The way you make me feel is the stuff forever is made of
I can see my future in you
No other girl for me will do

Got me lookin forward to forever

Think about it
You and me together
Lovin each other
Aimin at forever
Think about it
You and me together
Lovin each other babee
Think about it
You and me together
Lovin each other
Aimin at forever
Think about it
You and me together
Lovin each other babee
Think about it
You and me together
Lovin each other
Aimin at forever
Think about it
You and me together
Lovin each other babee
