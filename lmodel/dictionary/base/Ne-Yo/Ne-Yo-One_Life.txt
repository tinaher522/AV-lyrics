<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="One_Life">
You only get one life 
(one life, one life, one life)
You only get one life 
(one life, one life, one life)
Yeah yeah
Smile sometimes
Cry sometimes
Stop and take a moment to breathe 
(Hey, hey, hey)
Stay up late, out all night
Sit at home and just watch some TV 
(Hey, hey, hey)
When they come to write your story
Tell me what will they say (-ay)
Life can be a lovely picture
If you paint it that way
Starting today, today
If you never did before
And you never do again
Let's live today like there's no tomorrow
So no matter who you are
Do yourself a favor
And live as if you know
Love as if you know
You only get one life (whow)
You only get one life (whoow)
Keep your friends by your side
But appreciate time to yourself
