<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Sunshine">
Ohhh...Yeahh
Carolina blue dress
Same color shoes
You know Ima need to dress to impress
Hair ponytail
Little bit of make-up
I'm chillin wit my man today
And though I'm fly my gleam don't compare to your shine
You're the type of guy that always makes the girls cry
And I cant believe that you're mine sometimes
Baby you are my (sunshine)
Chase the clouds away
When I see your face baby
I like the night time,
But I can't live without my (sunshine)
*CHORUS*
Baby girl
You're the reason that I'm smiling all the time
You are my sunshine
(ooh ooh ooh)
Even if it starts to rain I'll be alright
'Cuz i got my sunshine
Hey...and i must confess
It ain't even all about sex (no)
Even tho you're the first one yet
To have your boy hollerin' yes (yes, yes)
You're a kiss in the mornin'
Before I stretch out mornin' yawnin'
And you're mine, all mine
Baby you make the Sun shine
*CHORUS*
Baby girl
You're the reason that I'm smiling all the time
You are my sunshine
(ooh ooh ooh)
Even if it starts to rain I'll be alright
'Cuz i got my sunshine
*BRIDGE #1*
Somebody gon know 'bout mine
So much more than just a dime
Even when it's cold outside
I've got sunshine
Somebody gon know 'bout mine
So thankful that he's all mine
Even when it's cold outside
I've got sunshine
Hmmm...girl the way that we do
I don't gotta tell you
Nothin' phony
No fake dream to sell you
Don't gotta worry
'bout bein' untrue
My love's concrete
Thus you can't see through
*BRIDGE #2*				
And when the rain clouds come
'Cuz we realistic, it ain's all fun
We gon be just fine
Long as you continue to be my sunshine
(yeah)
[repeat 1x]
*CHORUS*
Baby girl
You're the reason that I'm smiling all the time
You are my sunshine
(ooh ooh ooh)
Even if it starts to rain I'll be alright
'Cuz i got my sunshine
Sunshine...you be my sunshine...u be my sunshine...yeahhh
(sunshine)
I've got sunshine...on a cloudy day..
