<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="So_Sick_(Female_Version)">
i gotta change the station that i have
cause all i hear is you
it jus keeps reminding me
of all the thingz we used to do
and i know that i should turn
off the radio
but it's the only place i hear your voice anymore
(it'z rediculous)
it'z been months since I've spoken to u
(you aint keep in touch)
dont know why it came to this no
(but enough is enough)
no more walkin round wit ma head down
i dont wanna be a fool
cryin over you
(Chorus)
if your so sick of love songs
so tired of tears
you said you loved me
why aint you here?
im so sick of your love songs
so sad and slow
but i just cant turn off the radio
gotta fix that calendar i have
that'z marked july 16th
cause it seemz like you forgot
that waz our annaversary
when i heard your song it
made it hard to erase your memory
now when i heard ur songs i noe it's best for me
i cant believe that your
so sick of love songs
so tired of tears
you said u loved me
why aint you here?
im so sick of your love songs
so sad and slow
but i just cant turn off the radio

oOh
(now that im gone)
now that im gone
(i wanna be left alone)
Ooh
and everytime i see your smile
it'z lookin at our child
you shood noe
Ooh y cant you move on?
(Chorus)
if your so sick of love songs
so tired of tears
you said u loved me
why aint you here?
im so sick of your love songs
so sad and slow
but i just cant turn off the radio
(i just cant turn off the radio)
if your so sick of love songz (so sick of love songz)
so tired of tears (so tired of tears)
you said u loved me
why aint you here (yeaaaah) (y aint you here???)
im so sick of your love songz
so sad and slo (oo oh)
but i just cant turn off the radio
(i just cant turn off the radio)
(Chorus)
if your so sick of love songz
so tired of tears
you said u loved me
why aint you here?
im so sick of your love songz
so sad and slow
but i just cant turn off the radio
(i jus cant turn off the radio)
i just cant turn off the radio
