<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Sex_With_My_Ex">
I...memorize your special code
I can get in anytime i want
You...say i'm just a bit too bold
Know you want it tell me you dont
Girl what's your problem
I think you know good and well
Aint nobody strokin like me
Girl i'm your problem
Made you set that bar high as hell
I aint what you want but i'm what you need
Cant nobody do it better
And you know it, you do
Cant nodody get it wetter
Say you know it, it's true
Cuz i love sex with my ex...girlfriend
I...i luv...sex with my ex...girlfriend
I...really like the way you go
Beggin me to not kiss right there
Oh and you...suddenly just lose control
Beggin me to smack it and pull yo hair
Babe, understand you got a new man
(tellin me that your in love, okay)
Oh girl that's your thing
Long as you understand i get mine anytime
Night and through the day
Cant nobody do it better
And you know it, you do
Cant nodody get it wetter
Say you know it, it's true
Cuz i love sex with my ex...girlfriend
I...i luv...sex with my ex...girlfriend
Cant nobody do it like i do it and you know it
One thing that it's always goin be true is
Once mine always mine
And you know it, you do
Say you know it, it's true
I...i luv sex with my ex...girlfriend
I...luv sex with my ex...girlfriend
