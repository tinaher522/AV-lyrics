<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Stop_This_World">
Okay, 
I woke up in heaven today 
She kissed me I floated away, away 
Never felt anything so great 
Alright, 
Now I brace myself for the fights 
Something must go wrong cause it's way too right 
I'm light as a feather tonight 
[Chorus] 
Cause I can't feel the ground 
Someone let me down 
I never felt so high as I do now 
It's too good to be true 
I don't deserve you 
I never felt a love strong enough to 
Stop this world from spinning 
Stop this world from spinning 
[Verse 2] 
And I see, 
Heaven when she looks at me 
In her smile is the most amazing dream 
And in her eyes I fall asleep 
And I hope, 
Hope that she can see through the smoke 
Of my imperfections into my soul 
And my heart where she has control (she has control) 
[Chorus] 
Cause I can't feel the ground 
Someone let me down 
I never felt so high as I do now 
Its too good to be true 
I don't deserve you 
I never felt a love strong enough to 
Stop this world from spinning 
[Bridge] 
Happiness like this can never last (can never last) 
Turns into the memories of the past (turns into the memories of the past) 
(going just as fast) 
[Chorus] 
And I can't feel the ground 
Someone let me down 
I said I've never been so high as I am now 
Its too good to be true 
I don't deserve you 
I never felt a love strong enough to 
Stop this world from spinning 
Stop this world from spinning
