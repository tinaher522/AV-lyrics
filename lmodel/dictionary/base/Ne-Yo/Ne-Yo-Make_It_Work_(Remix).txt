<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Make_It_Work_(Remix)">
Sometimes I love sometimes I hate
These are the things I cant tolerate
When things are going good
Then times are great
But when things are bad
I wanna break your face
Leave this place
Take my keys and 'scape
Youre the first one to mention that we need a break.
But we just can't do it cuz we sealed our fate
So we gotta make ti work
I like it better that way.
you understand me
at least you say you do
lately thats enough for me
looking for perfect
surrounded by artificial
you're the closest thing to real i've seen
sure, everyone has their problems
thats a given
yours are the easiest to tolerate
this wasn't what we was wanting
how we're living
but let's take this good enough and turn it to great
baby understand...
this can only be as good as we both make it
guess sometimes its gonna hurt(yes sometimes its gonna hurt)
we can be as happy as we want to be girl
but we gotta make it work
we gotta make it work...
ay oh ay oh oh
we gotta make it work...
ay oh ay oh oh
we gotta make it work...

ay oh ay oh oh
we gotta make it work...
ay oh ay oh oh
thick and thin,(ooh)
the bad outweighs the good sometimes
that doesn't mean we're 'spose to give it up
my problems are yours,and yours are mine
these are the times that we love to hate
got me thinking about how much abuse I can take
what straw will break the camels back
and everytime I thought we were done we get right back.
Its things like that got me all confused I don't like the fact
I don't know your next move but I do know the truth and
I do know you love me and I trust that you know that i love you
we gotta make it work we been through the worse
we seen the best but we stuck in a curse.
Wouldn't exhibit the hurt wait until you say it first
As clean the dirt and proceed the church
Do you take this women yes I do hold hands close eyes and jump the broom
Like a bride and groom lets find a room
One day so lets make it work.
we gotta make it work...
ay oh ay oh oh
we gotta make it work...
ay oh ay oh oh
we gotta make it work...
ay oh ay oh oh
we gotta make it work...
ay oh ay oh oh
