<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Trouble">
Sweet, she like to model for me
The way she wear it is dangerous
She walk around me like a predator
And i'm something to eat
Nothing to her but a treat
Something she play with and leave alone
And i can't help it but to let her use me
Every little thing about her says shes trouble (trouble)
And every little thing she do just makes me want her more
More and more
She melts, melts herself all over me
As sexy candle but so much hotter
Pain is just pleasure with the volume up
I want it louder
Oh, I'm spending all my money on her
No matter where i go there she is
Half-naked waiting for me (waiting for me)
Waiting for me (waiting for me, oh)
Every little thing about her says shes trouble (trouble)
But every little thing she do just makes me want her more
More and more
More and more, Hey
More and more
More and more, Oh
Every little thing about her says shes trouble (trouble)
But every little thing she do just makes me want her more
Oh, Every little thing about her says shes trouble (trouble)
But every little thing she do just makes me want her more
More and more
More and more, Hey
More and more
More and more
