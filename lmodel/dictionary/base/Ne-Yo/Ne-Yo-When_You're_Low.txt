<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="When_You're_Low">
Is it just me or can you feel when your day is just gonna suck
It's like a pain in your brain from the second you get up
Get outta bed, try to ignore it but it's right there on your nose
It's mission is to keep you miserable I guess that's the way it goes
When you're low, you know that the world changes color
When you're down, the clouds are the loneliest grey
When you're low, you know everything's in slow motion
And it takes forever to get through your bad day
You wanna smile but your eyes won't do anything but cry
Negative thoughts dance in your mind like how everyday someone dies
Try to shake it off but it's not leaving it's on your skin it's on your clothes
Nothing to do but except it I guess that's the way it goes
When you're low, you know that the world changes color
When you're down, the clouds are the loneliest grey
When you're low, you know everything's in slow motion
And it takes forever to get through your bad day
Oh maybe I just shoulda stayed in bed today
Maybe I just shoulda stayed in bed today
Maybe I just shoulda stayed in bed today
Maybe I just shoulda stayed in bed...
When you're low, you know that the world changes color
When you're down, the clouds are the loneliest grey
When you're low, you know everything's in slow motion
And it takes forever to get through your bad day
Maybe I just shoulda stayed in bed today
Maybe I just shoulda stayed in bed today
Maybe I just shoulda stayed in bed today
