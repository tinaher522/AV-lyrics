<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Better_For_It">
I wash my hands of this situation,
Of this complication, 
That you call a relationship.
Scrub these walls, I might even repaint 'em
'Cause your memory stained them
And this color just ain't it
Scratch that idea, take this match right here
Watch it burn, burn
Cause a loss in love is a lesson learned.
Oh I'm so much better for it.
I'm so much better for dusting you off my shoulders,
Knowing that I don't need you no more.
I'm so much better for it.
And I'm movin', cleanin' out my closet
And Imma get rid of all of this
Drama that you left in here
Ooh, you've been officially evicted
Cause you just don't get it
So let me make it nice 'n' clear
Baby no more games
Love and respect are two things 
You must earn, earn
But a loss in love is a lesson learned.
Oh I'm so much better for it.
I'm so much better for dusting you off my shoulders,
Knowing that I don't need you no more.
I'm so much better for it.
I'm so much better for it.
I'm so much better for dusting you off my shoulders,
Knowing that I don't need you no more.
I'm so much better for it.
And I'm better for no longer giving you
I'm gonna shoot me down out of the blue
Better for finally realizing the truth
That I can do so much better than you
Oh I'm so much better for it.
I'm so much better for dusting you off my shoulders,
Knowing that I don't need you no more.
I'm so much better for it.
I'm so much better for it.
I'm so much better for dusting you off my shoulders,
Knowing that I don't need you no more.
I'm so much better for it.
I'm so much better for it.
I'm so much better for it.
