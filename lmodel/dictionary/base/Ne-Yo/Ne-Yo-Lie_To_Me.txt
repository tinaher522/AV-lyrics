<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Lie_To_Me">
Lie to me
Lie to me
Lie to me
Lie to me
Lie to me
Lie to me
Lie to me
Lie
I just wanne be numb
I don't wanne feel a thing
I don't want reality
Actualy, reality stings
How about we just pretend, 
That your cellphone didn't even ring
And that I wasn't on the other side of the door
Listening to everything.
Tell me another lie
I don't wanna know what I know to be true, 
What I need you to do, tell me another lie, 
I don't wanna know what I know to be true, 
What I need you to do, tell me another lie, 
I don't wanna know what I know to be true, 
What I need you to do, tell me another lie, 
I don't wanna know what I know to be true, 
What I need you to do, tell me another lie... 
Lie to me
Lie to me
Lie to me
Lie to me
Lie to me
Lie to me
Lie to me
Lie
Please make me believe
That there is nobody for you and me
When I ask who where you talking to
Tell me it was Candy
Tell me the last night you didn't leave
After you thought I was asleep
Krept back in that 6 45
Tell me it was just a dream
Baby I need, desperately, desperately
To believe you
Cause I wont be held resonpsible
For what, what I might do
Baby I need, desperately, desperately
To believe you
Cause I wont be held responsible
For what, what I might to do me another lie
I don't wanna know what I know to be true, 
What I need you to do, tell me another lie, 
I don't wanna know what I know to be true, 
What I need you to do, tell me another lie, 
I don't wanna know what I know to be true, 
What I need you to do, tell me another lie, 
I don't wanna know what I know to be true, 
What I need you to do, tell me another lie... 
Tell me another lie
Tell me another lie
Tell me another lie
Tell me another lie
I don't wanna know what I know to be true, 
What I need you to do, tell me another lie, 
I don't wanna know what I know to be true, 
What I need you to do, tell me another lie, 
I don't wanna know what I know to be true, 
What I need you to do, tell me another lie
