<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Mi_Love">
Mi love, mi love, mi love, mi love, mi love it.
Mi love, mi love, mi love, mi love.
Baby make me say, that I love it
Never go away, don't think of it
Till my dieing day, wanna be covered
By the love you give (the love you give) 
Baby make me wish, I could have it
When your not around, your a habit
That I can't quit now
You just don't understand, what this is 
I need you here babe
Mi love it when you touch
Mi love it when you kiss
Mi love it when you take your time
Mi love it when you tell me that you love it
What you wanna do lover
Mi love it when you say its all mine
Mi love it
Mi love, mi love, mi love, mi love, mi love it 
Mi love, mi love, mi love, mi love
Listen to me (anything you want) anything babe (I will give)
Because you want it like I want it (just say the word) 
Say the word yeah (that it is) because I want it like you want it
Baby make me say, that I love it
Never go away, don't think of it
Till my dieing day, wanna be covered
By the love you give (the love you give)
Mi love it when you touch
Mi love it when you kiss
Mi love it when you take your time
Mi love it when you tell me that you love it
What you wanna do lover
Mi love it when you say its all mine
Mi love it
Mi love, mi love, mi love, mi love, mi love it 
Mi love, mi love, mi love, mi love
