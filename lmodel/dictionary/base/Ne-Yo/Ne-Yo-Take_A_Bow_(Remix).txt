<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Take_A_Bow_(Remix)">
[Ne-Yo (Rihanna)]
She gave a round of applause
(round of applause)
Followed by a standing ovation
(standing ovation)
[Verse 1: Ne-Yo]
I feel so dumb right now
Standing outside her house
Trying to apologize
Cuz I told quite a few lies
Damn
And she found me out
So now I'm saying sorry cuz I am
Though it's very clear to me 
That she don't give a damn
[Chorus: Ne-Yo]
Got me out here putting on a show
Neighbors laughing at me
Just want her to know
Without her I can't be happy
So I'm putting on a show
Hope it's entertaining
Don't say we're over now
(but it's over now)
Please let me in the house
[Verse 2: Rihanna]
Grab your things and get gone
(get gone you better hurry up)
Before the sprinklers come on
Talking bout girl I love you 
You're the one
This just looks like a re-run
What else is on
So don't tell me you're sorry cuz you're not
Baby when I know you're only sorry you got caught
[Chorus]
But you put on quite a show
Really had me going
Now it's time to go
Curtain's finally closing
That was quite a show
Very entertaining
But it's over now
(but it's over now)
Go on and take a bow
[Verse 3: Ne-Yo (Rihanna)]
She said and the award for the best lie goes to you
(and the award for the best lie goes to you)
For making me believe
(for making me believe)
That you could be
(that you could be)
Faithful to me
(faithful to me)
Let's hear your speech out
(let's hear you speak now)
She gave a round of applause
(round of applause)
Followed by a standing ovation
(standing ovation)
[Chorus: Ne-Yo (Rihanna)]
Got me out here putting on a show
(but you put on quite a show)
Neighbors laughing at me
(really had me going)
Just want her to know
(now it's time to go)
Without her I can't be happy
(curtain's finally closing)
So I'm putting on a show
(that was quite a show)
Hope it's entertaining
(very entertaining)
Don't say we're over now
But it's over now
(but it's over now)
Please let me in the house
(go on and take a bow )
[Ne-Yo]
Baby please
Don't say it's over now
[Rihanna]
But it's over now
(both laughing)
