<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Work_In_Progress">
Look in my eyes
Tell me what you see
Do you see perfection in me
To you do I look complete
Now take one more look past my celebrity
That's where you'll find the real me
To you do I still look the complete
Bridge:
I got me material thing than I could ever need
I got the love from my fans that adore me
And I'm grateful
And I thank you so very much
But my love for myself is lacking a little bit
Just a little bit
I can mend it I'm working on it
Staying faithful
And what I'm trying to say is
Chorus:
Just like you
Sometimes I get down
Sometimes I just wanna cry
Sometimes I get depressed
And just like me
Trying to be complete (trying to be complete)
Just understand we're all just a work in progress
Verse:
Life can be difficult
No one promised there would be
Sunshine, all the time
Easy
Some pain is guaranteed
But it ain't impossible
You can find the joy you see
Took me a while but I did find me
Open your eyes and you will see
Chorus:
I'm just like you
Sometimes I get down
Sometimes I just wanna cry
Sometimes I get depressed
Just like me
Trying to be complete (trying to be complete)
Just understand we're all just a work in progress
Bridge:
Anybody knowing what it is to struggle
Never ever running in the face of trouble
Said I'm with you (I'm with you)
I feel you (I feel you)
I'm with you
Just like you
Sometimes I fall
But don't we all
Baby I feel your pain
We're all the same
We're all the same
Chorus:
I'm just like you
Sometimes I get down
Sometimes I just wanna cry
Sometimes I get depressed
Just like me (Just like me)
Trying to be complete (trying to be complete)
Just understand we're all just a work in progress
Work in progress
Just like you (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Sometimes I get down (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Sometimes I just wanna cry (can you feel me, can you hear me)
Sometimes I get depressed
Just like me
Trying to be complete (trying to be complete)
Just understand we're all just a work in progress
