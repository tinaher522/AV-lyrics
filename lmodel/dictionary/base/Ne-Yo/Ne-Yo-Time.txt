<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Time">
How come you don't make time for me anymore 
thats the last thing she said to you
and now when you call she don't answer anymore
or the line is busy and you can't get through
and the time it will take you to learn from your mistake
and the time it will take to dial the phone
and the time it will take you to realize her greatness, she'll be gone, she's moved on
to someone who takes the time
her love wasn't her priority to you
you had other things on your mind
and now that it's much to little and too far too late
the busy signals all thats left behind
you're all alone 
and the time it will take you to learn from your mistake
and the time it will take to dial the phone
and the time it will take you to realize her greatness, she'll be gone, she's moved on
to someone who takes the time
heyy no one knows what they have until they don't
and by then it doesn't matter anymore
you're all alone
and the time it will take you to learn from your mistake
and the time it will take to dial the phone
and the time it would take you to realize her greatness, she'll be gone (she'll be gone)
and the time it will take you to realize her greatness, she'll be gone, she's moved on
hang up the phone...
