<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Stupid_In_Love">
Mmmmm
Stupid in love
Ohhh
Stupid in love
Oh oh oh oh
Verse 1
Let me tell you something
Never have i ever been a size ten in my whole life
I left the engine running
I just came to see
What you would do if I gave you a chance to make things right 
So I made it, even though Katy told me that this will be nothing but
A waste of time
And she was right
Ummm.
Don't understand it but on your hands is still you insist on repeatedly trying to tell me lies
And I just don't know why?
Ohhh
Chorus
This is stupid
I'm not stupid
Don't talk to me
Like I'm stupid (stupid love)
I still love you but
I just can't do this
I maybe dumb but
I'm not stupid
Verse 2
My new nickname is you idiot (such an idiot) ohhhh
That's what my friends are calling me
When they see me leaning to my phone
They're telling me let go
He is not the one
I thought I saw your potential
I guess that's what made me dumb
He don't want it.
Not like you want it
Scheming and cheating
Oh girl why do you waste your time
You know he ain't right
They're telling me this
I don't wanna listen but you insist on repeatedly trying to tell me lies
And I just don't know why? Ohhhh
Chorus
This is stupid
I'm not stupid
Don't talk to me
Like I'm stupid (stupid love)
I still love you but
I can't do this
I maybe dumb but
I'm not stupid
Bridge
Trying to make this work
But you act like a jerk
Silly of me to keep holding on
Ohhhh
But the dust cap is off
You don't know what you've lost
And you won't realize till 
I'm gone, gone, gone
That I was the one
Which one of us is really dumb
Wow wow wow....
Ohhh
Noohh
Chorus
This is stupid (no no no)
I'm not stupid (no no no)
Don't talk to me
Like I'm stupid (like i'm stupid)
I still love you but (stupid love)
I just can't do this (I just can't do this but)
I maybe dumb but
I'm not stupid
I maybe dumb but I'm not stupid in love.
