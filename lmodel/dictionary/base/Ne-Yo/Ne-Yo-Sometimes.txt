<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Sometimes">
Its starting to rain again,
Everyone is gone now,
Even the sun,
Starting to rain again,
Drove her away,
What have i done,
I've been high, I've been low,
I've been welthy and I've been poor,
Don't know much, but one thing I know,
This ain't no fun,
[chorus]
Sometimes i wish that i could stand here
And fade away (sometimes) hey
So that no one could see the tears running down my face (sometime)
Invisibility would be great
Lust is the craving,
Sex is a drug,
Starting to rain again,
I give my world
For just one more hug,
Well I've been up, I've been down
Stayed in one place,
I moved around,
If i know then what i know now
We'd still be in love
[chorus]
Sometimes i wish that i could stand here and fade away (sometimes) hey
So that no one could see the tears running down my face (sometime) 
Invisibility would be great
Couldn't look at myself in the mirror,
Say to myself how dumb could you be,
Everything seem so much clearer,
If no one could see me,
[chorus]
Sometimes i wish that i could stand here and fade away (sometimes) Ohhoo
So that no one could see the tears running down my face (sometime)
Invisibility would be great
