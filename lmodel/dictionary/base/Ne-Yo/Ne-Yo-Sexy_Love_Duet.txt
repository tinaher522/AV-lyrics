Neyo: 
My sexy love (so sexy) 
She makes the hairs on the back of my neck stand up (i do) 
With just one touch (thank you) 
Candace: 
I still get butterflies everytime he passes by 
I cant say why 
N- And I just can't think 
(Of anything else I'd rather do) 
C- Than to hear you sing 
(Sing my name the way you do) 
N- Oh when we do our thing 
(When we do the things we do) 
Both- Baby girl/boy you make me sing (oh oh oh) (oh) 
Chorus: 
Sexy love 
And the things you do (oh baby baby)
