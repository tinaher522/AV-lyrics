<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Think_About_It">
You got a girlfriend
I know you know you got a good girl
Sexy, sophisticated, good girl
Minor mistakes are understood girl
You know what I mean
I know you know
But she got that one home girl
And she's that if-you-could-you-would girl
That smilin' at you
She's up-to-no-good girl
Tellin' you your girl don't gotta know
The little devil on your shoulder
Screamin', "What you waitin' for"
Hold on now.
Think about it
You got to think about it
I know you want it
Think about it
Before you do something stupid
And lose your girl
Think about it[x10]
Before you do something stupid
And lose your girl
Think about it[x4]
Stuck.
Telling yourself you're not a bad man
And you know the good thing that you have man
But then you look down at that ass, man
You know what I mean,
(Daym) I know you know
You plan it in your mind
Tell your girl you're goin' out just you and your men
So you can take Shawty to the mall and (get in)
COz she said, "You're girl don't gotta know"
The little devil on your shoulder sayin', "What you waiting for"
Hold on, man.
Think about it.
You got to
Think about it
Said, I know you want it
But think about it
Before you do something stupid
And lose your girl
Think about it[x10]
Before you do something stupid
And lose your girl
Think about it[x4]
Listen homie.
Trust me.
I know how you feel.
I know just how you feel
Cause I've been there myself once or twice
Is it really worth destroying something real for somethin' like for just one night
Oh.
Think about it.
You got to
Think about it
I know you want it
But think about it
Before you do something stupid
And lose your girl
Think about it[x10]
Before you do something stupid
And lose your girl[x4]
