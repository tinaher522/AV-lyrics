<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Comfortable">
Verse 1:
Pick up, pick up
Baby girl pick up the phone
I kno you kno its me
You got it on your ringtone
We off in this room and
It's about 4 a.m. i just left the studio
I think you kno wassup
I think you kno its on so
Hook:
Put on somethin thats
Next to nothin and
Meet me at the crib
Baby you kno where it is
Hurry up 
And girl when you show up
Let me show you what
Relaxation is
Baby lets do it like this
Chorus:
We're gona be chillin
Girl come in and lets get comfortable
Baby you and me tonight
We're gona be chillin
Girl come in and lets get comfortable
Baby you and me tonight
Verse 2:
Just pull your hair back
And throw on your sweats
Or somethin less
You aint got to impress

No need to fix up no make up
No stress
Girl i care less
I just want you right here
With mee
Yeahh
Hook:
Put on somethin thats

Verse 3:
Lay down on the couch
And let me
Coress the curviness of your body baby
Anything you want to do babe
Long as we're just chillin
Its alright
Lay down on the floor and let me
Do somethin to have your legs shakin baby
Said anything you want to do babe
We jus gon chill tonight
We're gona be chillin
Girl come in and lets get comfortable
Baby you and me tonight
We're gona be chillin
Girl come in and lets get comfortable
Baby you and me tonight
