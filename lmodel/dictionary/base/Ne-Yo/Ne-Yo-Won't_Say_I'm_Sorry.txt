<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Won't_Say_I'm_Sorry">
Can't feel bad about feeling this good,
Come on love,you know we tried,
And i apologize for going about it the wrong way,
But for falling in love,i can't say i'm sorry.
I'll admit it,it's wrong
The way that thisÂ ?? occured
We was there together
And i fell in love with her
But you gotta admit,
We were both on our way out
(we wouldnt even talk to each other)
I know i should of broken up,
Before i moved on
For that im wrong,but for loving her its no,no
I wont say im sorry(noo,no,no)
I fell in love and,
I wont say im sorry(no,noo,no no no)
I cant apologize,
For loving her the way i do.
The only thing that i regret,
Is me finding how this could hurt you,
But you gotta admit,baby
We were both on our way out
(we wouldnt even talk to each other)
I know i should've broken up,
Before i moved on,for that im wrong
But for loving her this strong
I wont say im sorry(noo,no,no)
I fell in love and,
I wont say im sorry(no,noo,no no no)
She didnt know this,ill admit
It was wrong
(i guess we shouldve broken up,before i moved on)
But for falling in love,
I wont say im sorry
No, i wont say im sorry(no,no)
I wont say im sorry
Say,i wont say im sorry(no,no,ooo)
I fell in love and,
I wont say im sorry(no,noo,no no no)
I fell in love and,
I wont say im sorry(no,noo,no no no)
