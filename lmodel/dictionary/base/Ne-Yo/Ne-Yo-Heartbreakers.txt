Wowow
Hey ey hey ey hey ey
Mmm mmm 
He used to put me up one day
Show me what to look for
Wanted his eyes
So that I wouldn't get to fall
Everything I had by a fella
Knew the right things to say
And I was a real good student, knew it
So when he was trying to gave me, couldn't do it
I thought he was looking out for me
Never ever thought he'd turn out to be...
He use to tell me, 
Watch out for heartbreakers
All they do is take your love and leave
I never thought that he'd turn out to be 
The heartbreaker that he warned me 'bout
He told me
Watch out for heartbreakers
All they do is take your love and leave
I never thought that he'd turn out to be 
The heartbreaker that he warned me 'bout
He used to tell me a playa
Would say just about anything to lay her down
See ya later
Opening my eyes but blinding me at the same time
I can't name nobody, ooh I really wish that I could blame somebody
But it was my fault, had me so wrong
Not paying attention
That's where I went wrong
He use to tell me,
Watch out for heartbreakers
All they do is take your love and leave
I never thought that he'd turn out to be 
The heartbreaker that he warned me 'bout
He told me
Watch out for heartbreakers
All they do is take your love and leave
I never thought that he'd turn out to be 
The heartbreaker that he warned me 'bout
Oooh ooooh
Silly me, silly me
I was so busy stressing
That I forget the first lesson
'Keep your eyes open at all times'
Wooo
Silly me, silly me
Now I'm promising myself
I'm only fallin' for the one time
Mistakes I learnt from mine
What I learn is...
Watch out for heartbreakers
All they do is take your love and leave
I never thought that he'd turn out to be 
The heartbreaker that he warned me 'bout
He told me
Watch out for heartbreakers
All they do is take your love and leave
I never thought that he'd turn out to be 
The heartbreaker that  he warned me 'bout
Watch out for heartbreakers
All they do is take your love and leave
I never thought that he'd turn out to be 
The heartbreaker that he warned me 'bout
He told me
Watch our for heartbreakers
All they do is take your love and leave
I never thought that he'd turn out to be 
The heartbreaker that  he warned me 'bout
Hey ey hey ey hey ey
