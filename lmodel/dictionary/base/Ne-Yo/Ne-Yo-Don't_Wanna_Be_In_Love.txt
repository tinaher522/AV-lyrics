<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Don't_Wanna_Be_In_Love">
I don't wanna know you
I don't wanna know your name
Said I don't wanna call you or talk about anything
I don't wanna like you,
I don't care if you like me
Said if you haven't caught on yet,
I lied through my tears
See the problem is more I fight it,
Harder to it gets to deny it
But everything in me wants to be with you
But I seem were love can leave you devestated
So everyday I look at the mirror and say this
I tell my self
(I don't wanna be [x2]) in love
(I don't wanna be [x2]) in love
Cause I know what it is, and I know what it does
So I don't wanna be in love
Right now it loves too much
I don't wanna be in love
Don't wanna love when you walk in the room
Don't wanna love everything to the plain black of your shoes
Don't wanna love when you put on sweats in the afternoon
When you call on next to me when we watched cartoon said I don't want to be
(I don't wanna be [x2]) in love
(I don't wanna be [x2]) in love
Cause I know what it is, and I know what it does
So I don't wanna be in love
Right now it loves too much
I don't wanna be in love
Wish I didn't love the way
When you smile at me in the sunshine
Wish we can live happily ever after
But girl I'm terrified, even though it feels so right, I tell myself
[x2]
(I don't wanna be [x2]) in love
(I don't wanna be [x2]) in love
Cause I know what it is, and I know what it does
So I don't wanna be in love
Right now it loves too much
I don't wanna be in love
Right now is much too much
So I don't want to be in love
