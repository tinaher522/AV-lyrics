<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Miss_Your_Company">
I remember you
I will miss your company
[x3]
She waked up with the sun in the morning
Writing up a room with a smile
Make a man feel like a kid
Wife to her husband, mother to a child
Brought up all type of a real woman... ever woman wish they could be
Why wouldn't god want you for himself
Must be why he took you from me
But I always
I remember you
Always remember you
I will miss your company
Miss your company
[x2]
Could go on forever about the things I miss about you the most
But it wouldn't make any difference ain't no sense that cause it won't bring you back
But of everything that I will miss like how you use to smile at me even more than
Make love girl that I'm missing
Cause having you around your company (And I always...)
I remember you
Always remember you
I will miss your company
Miss your company
[x2]
I miss you
Said I miss you girl
I miss you
Loving you tenderly
Taking good care of me
But more importantly just your company
I remember you
Always remember you
I will miss your company
Miss your company
