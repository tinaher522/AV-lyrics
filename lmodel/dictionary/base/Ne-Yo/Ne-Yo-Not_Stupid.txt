<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Not_Stupid">
Hey!
Not, not stupid, stupid!
Hey!
Not, not stupid, stupid!
Hey!
Not, not stupid, stupid!
Hey!
Not, not stupid, stupid!
He says how, come we can't fix what's wrong with this?
He says how come you don't want this like you did?
He says why can't you just fall into me one more time?
He says why can we start over again?
Chorus:
I say because I'm not, not stupid, stupid!
And I've never been, oh no!
I'm not stupid!
And I've never been, one!
Not stupid!
And I've never been someone......
........
It's over!
So dump it!
I say it's over!
So dump it!
I say because I'm not stupid,
And I've never been, so this is the end!
It's over!
I can't miss her! I'm not the man I was!
O.K. baby, O.K. baby, O.K...
He says please baby, please baby, please,
Don't give up on us!
O.K. baby, O.K. baby, O.K...
He says why can't you just fall into me one more time?
He says why can we start over again?
Chorus: (1x)
Not, not stupid,
It's over! (x3)
No more second chances!
....................
Under these circumstances,
Best thing to do is goodbye and so long!
Chorus:(1x)
Not, not stupid,
It's over! (x3)
So this is the end!
It's over!
