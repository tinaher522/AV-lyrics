<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Carry_On_(Her_Letter_To_Him)">
Ah, carry on, carry on, yeah
Ah, carry on, carry on, yeah
I said uhu, so you found another bed you'd rather sleep in tonight, yeah
I said uhu, so I gotta loose for what you think it's a win tonight, yo,
Said uhu, some night is the night that you wanna say your fault, yeah
I said uhu, sounds like of a sin be the sound of my ringtone
As I call you all night long
Well go and carry on, aha, go and carry on, aha, whoa
I said do you, cause I'm through
Hold on, I won't so carry on,hey
Uhu, so you found another reason to go do what you do, yeah, yeah
I said uhu, well I ran out of reasons to sit here waiting on you, whoa
I said uhu, you showed me now exactly what you want,
What you want, hey, uhu
Now learn that you're exactly what I don't
Too much fun, too long
So go and carry on, aha, so go and carry on, aha
I said do you, cause I'm through
Hold on, I won't so carry on, hey
So carry on
You don't want it, and I don't need it
Better use for my time, so carry on
Cause you don't want it, said I don't deserve it
I'm moving along with mine, ay, uhu, uhu
Aha, uhu, aha, uhu, aha, uhu
So carry on, hey, carry on, hey
I said do you, cause I'm through
Hold on, I won't so carry on, hey
Oho, whoa, carry on.
