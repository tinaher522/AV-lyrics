<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Lonely_Girls_Club">
I can't slow it down
You keep speedin up
(My heart rate)
My blood pressure
(The sweat beadin up)
On my forehead
(Trying to maintain control)
Cause of what she said
(Dammit I can't take no more)
And I'm so tired of
You accusing me
Of shit I know I don't do
If your damn girlfriends
Bring it to you (you)
Instantly assume that it's true
So,
Go ahead and join
The lonely girls club
Listen to your friends
Leave me alone
You can go and join
The lonely girls club
It's obvious that's
What you want
The lonely girls club
Go on, go on, go on
The lonely girls club
Go on, go on, go on
The lonely girls club
I can't figure it out
I don't understand
(Why you listen to)
Them girls that
Don't got a man
She's givin advice
(Like she's got all the answers for you)
But can't get her own
Shit right, ....
Baby
They, look at us
And they get mad cuz
You've got what they
Wish that they had
They want to split us
Up, oh so bad (and)
If you're gonna
Let them do that
Then go
Go ahead and join
The lonely girls club
(The lonely girls club)
Listen to your friends
And leave me alone
You can go and join
The lonely girls club
(The lonely girls club)
It's obvious that's
What you want
(Cuz that's what you want)
The lonely girls club
Go on, go on, go on
You wanna be a lonely girl
(Said) go on, go on, go on
Listen,
Misery loves company
(Misery loves company)
You make your decision
You listen to them
'Fore you listen to me
You've been recruited
Go on and leave
Go ahead and join
The lonely girls club
Listen to your friends
Leave me alone
You can go and join
The lonely girls club
It's obvious that's
What you want
(Cuz that's what you want)
The lonely girls club
Go ahead and join (go ahead)
The lonely girls club (go ahead)
Listen to your friends
Leave me alone
You can go and join
The lonely girls club
It's obvious that's
What you want
The lonely girls club
Go on, go on, go on
The lonely girls club
Go on, go on, go on
You wanna be a lonely girl
Go on, go on, go on
You wanna be
Go on, go on, go on
Go on, the lonely girls club
