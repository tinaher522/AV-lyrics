<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Know_Your_Name">
Excuse me
I couldn't help but notice
You noticing me
And I was definitely noticing you
My name is
You know my name
But listen 
I have a question 
[Verse 1]
No it ain't like me to drop too hard
Or go out of my way to know who you are
Said if you're not one for chasing
But I'll admit
Something in you
Has got my attention girl
So if I can
Be a gentleman
Can I ask your permission girl
[Chorus]
Said if it's alright with you
Can I know your  name
And maybe call you sometime
Can I know your name
Can I know your name
[Verse 2]
Looking at you girl I see so much
So much potential for something better than that
Like maybe me and you becoming us
I'm not trying to scare you
But in your eyes
I can see why
People write love songs
And if God allowed 
I could see how
I could love you for so long
[Chorus x2]
Said if it's alright with you
Can I know your  name
And maybe call you sometime
Can I know your name
Can I know your name
Said if it's alright with you
Can I know your  name
And maybe call you sometime
Can I know your name
Can I know your name
[Verse 3]
Something about you
That makes me wanna know you
Said I wanna get t know you
I just wanna show you me
Said I really wanna get to know you
See what this thing could be
[Chorus x2]
Said if it's alright with you
Can I know your  name
And maybe call you sometime
Can I know your name
Can I know your name
Said if it's alright with you
Can I know your  name
And maybe call you sometime
Can I know your name
Can I know your name
