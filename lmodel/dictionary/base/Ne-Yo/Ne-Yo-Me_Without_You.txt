Uh, yeah yeah
Uh, mmm, yeah yeah
Mmm, mmm,
Yeah yeah.....
Sometimes I'm just wrong, hardest thing I've ever had to say
We don't get along,
All the time I've [fret?], don't mean just walk away, just walk away
We question this relationship,
Start to ask ourselves, why put up with it? 
And though, we go through [thin and thick?], to be over it, just don't make no sense, oh no
Mmm..
Me without you, baby that's impossible to see (impossible to see)
Baby, me without you (wooh), baby there's no other girl for me (no other girl for me) ohh yeah, yeah.
You were right (ehh, yeah yeah yeah yeah)
Second hardest thing ive had to say (second hardest thing ive had to say)
Please dont take your light (ehh yeah yeah yeah yeah)
'cause without it i cant find my way (find my way)

Never truly worthy of your love 
And the day that i die, is the day that i don't try
Be the best man I can be for us... yeah.
