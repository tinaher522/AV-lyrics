<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Coke_Side_Of_Life">
Yeah Yeah, Mmm
(Verse 1)
Another perfect day.
Reason to smile,
Reason to laugh the world away.
Yeah Yeah Mmm
Another excuse to say,
"Don't sweat the small stuff,
It's all small stuff anyway"
Yeah Yeah Yeah Mmm
(Chorus):
It's the place we wanna go,
It's the world we wanna know,
Everybody wants to live 
The Coke Side of Life
(Yeah) 
Yeah yeah
(Yeah)
(Verse 2)
Mmm Dancing here with you (dancing here with you)
Nothing better, us together enjoying the view
Ooh ooh woowoo yeah
And all we want to do
(all we want to do hey)
Is be happy (oh) come with me (oh)
Let me show you
Ooh ho
It's the place we wanna go
It's the world we wanna know
Everybody wants to live 
The Coke Side of Life
Yeah
Yeah Yeah
Wooohooo
Let's have a party tonight
(Have a party tonight)
Let's acknowledge what's wrong
(Let's celebrate what's right)
And maybe we can find the coke side of life
It's the place we wanna go (place we wanna go)
It's the world we wanna know (world we wanna know)
Everybody wants to live (yeah yeah yeah)
The Coke Side of Life
It's the place we wanna go (place we wanna go)
It's the world we wanna know (world we wanna know)
Everybody wants to live 
The Coke Side of Life (coke side of liiiiffeee)
