<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="I_Got_You">
Trust you, believe you
There's nobody for you but me (well)
You tell me daily
But I know not to believe (well)
Late night phone calls
When you thought that I was asleep
It's clever that you'd think you'd be (well)
Baby I know everything like (uh)
Even what you're thinking, ooh
How the hell did she fright'n me out?
Very simple
Everything that you say
Everything that you do
I can stand and watch you
I got all that I need
Baby boy must believe
When I say I got you
'Cause I ain't never been a fool
So notice one thing is true
Said I got you
You say you work late
Baby in reality (well)
It's Stacey, cute girl, and it's been 'nough for about two weeks
You don't know it
Stacey's part of my crew
Has a test up put her on you
Just to see what you would do
Hook, line and sinker
You took the bait just like I thought you would
Very simple
Everything that you say
Everything that you do
I can stand and watch you
I got all that I need
Baby boy must believe
When I say I got you
'Cause I ain't never been a fool
So notice one thing is true
Said I got you
You've been set up
You should get up and go get your thing
I'm fed up, so get up
Go get your thing
You've been set up
You should get up and go get your thing
Ooh, go get your thing
Ooh, go get your thing
'Cause I ain't never been a fool
So notice one thing is true
Said notice one thing is true
Said I got you
Everything that you say
Everything that you do
I can stand and watch you
I got all that I need
Baby boy must believe
When I say I got you
'Cause I ain't never been a fool
So notice one thing is true
Said I got you
