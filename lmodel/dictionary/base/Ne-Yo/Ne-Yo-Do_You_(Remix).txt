[Ne-yo]
Maybe this decision was a mistake.
You probably don't care what I have to say.
But it's been heavy on my mind for months now.
Guess I'm trying to clear some mental space.
I would love to talk to you in person.
But I understand why that can't be.
I'll leave you alone for good I promise.
If you answer this one question for me.
I just wonder,
Do you ever,
Think of me,
Anymore, do you?
[Mary J Blige]
Found it lying there in front of my door
Picked it up before my man could see
Not that I was tryin' to hide it from him
Call it me just tryin' to keep the peace
Knew who it was from before I opened it
Knew what it would say before I read
Tore the letter up and threw it away
With this question burning in my head
I just wonder,
Do you ever,
Think of me,
Anymore, do you?
[Ne-yo] I know what we have is dead and gone.
[Mary J Blige] Too many times I made you cry.
[Ne-yo] And I don't mean to interupt your life.
[Ne-yo and Mary J Blige] I just wonder do I cross your mind?
[Ne-yo and Mary J Blige]
I just wonder,
Do you ever,
Think of me,
Anymore, do you?
I just wonder
Do you ever
Think of me
Anymore
Do you?
I just wonder
Do you ever
Think of me
Anymore
Do you?
I just wonder
Do you ever
Think of me
Anymore
Do you?
Yeah, yeah, yeah
