Yeah yeah yeah, ohh, nooo
Verse 1:
Baby girl you're gonna get us hit
Messin' with me in the car feelin' on my (Hair)
Trynna stay in the lane
But I can't complain
Cuz you're doing your damn thing
People looking at us when they pass man
Swerve a little bit up in the fast lane
Girl I don't care
Let them stare
We're almost there
Hook:
Baby tell me what you need (Don't)
Don't even worry about it (I guarantee it)
I guarantee I've got it (Yeah)
Baby I'll take care of everything
Just concentrate on what I'm about to do to you
Chorus:
I got cranberry and Grey Goose
Sip if you want to (Smoke out if you want to)
Smoke out if you want to
Baby you ain't gotta go nowhere
Just bring yourself babe
I got everything else babe
Baby you ain't gotta go nowhere
I got cranberry and grey goose
Sip if you want to (Smoke out if you want to)
Smoke out if you want to
Baby you ain't gotta go nowhere
Just bring yourself babe
I got everything else babe
You ain't gotta go nowhere
Verse 2:
It was a close call
But we finally made it
I can tell by the look in your eyes
You ain't too patient
Slightly inebriated
Slow down baby girl we've got time
And I'm gonna take it
So just kick back, unzip your coat
Gonna be here for a while
Then turn around slowly
Bit my lip and cracked a little smile
Tell me what you wanna do girl
Its all on you girl
Just be prepared for me to rock your world
Chorus:
I got cranberry and Grey Goose
Sip if you want to
Smoke out if you want to (You)
Baby you ain't gotta go nowhere (Go nowhere)
Just bring yourself babe
I got everything else babe (I got everything else babe, hey)
You ain't gotta go nowhere (Cranberry and Grey Goose)
I got cranberry and Grey Goose (Sip if you want to)
Sip if you want to
Smoke out if you want to (You ain't got to go nowhere)
Baby you ain't gotta go nowhere
Just bring yourself babe
I got everything else babe (Oh yeah)
You ain't gotta go nowhere
Bridge:
Tell me what you need (Oh, tell me, what you need babe)
Baby I'll take care of everything
Just concentrate on what I'm 'bout do to you babe, oh
Chorus:
I got cranberry and Grey Goose
Sip if you want to (Sip if you want to)
Smoke out if you want to
Baby you ain't gotta go nowhere (You ain't gotta go nowhere)
Just bring yourself babe

Baby you ain't gotta go nowhere (Oh)
I got cranberry and Grey Goose (Cranberry and Grey Goose)
Sip if you want to (Sip if you want to)
Smoke out if you want to
Baby you ain't gotta go nowhere
Just bring yourself babe
I got everything else babe (So I got everything)
You ain't gotta go nowhere (You ain't gotta go)
