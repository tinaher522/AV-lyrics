Compound
Is what the radio should sound like
Its what the club shoup sound like 
Its what the radio should sound like
Lets go, Lets go
Verse 1:
Lets not make this harder than it gots to be
I dont like you, you dont like me
But we tried(right)
Lets not take this farther than it gots to go 
My no was yes, your yes was no
So we both lied
And its seeming this is for the best 
Cause to me girl your just added stress
And so am I to you
Course:
And it is, what it is
Its whatever
We obviously aint sposed to be, 
Together
Lets stop messin around
Put this thing in the ground
(we gotta put this thing in the ground)
(aye, its what the radio should sound like)
Verse 2:
Oooooooo
Lets not try to fix the un fixable 
Its been broke too many times before
But we was blind 
Lets not get to throwing
Blaming
Claimin it aint yo fault
When it sure the hell aint mine 
(yea,yea,yea)
And its seeming we should be apart
Cause this was over before it got to start
Keep yours ill keep my heart
Couse:
And it is, what it is
Its whatever
We obviously aint sposed to be, 
Together
Lets stop messin around
Put this thing in the ground
(we gotta put this thing in the ground)
(thing in the ground)(right)
Listen
Now i dont normally do this but uh
Verse 3(Ne-Yo rapping):
On this path we young, wack matromonious
Only us 2 get hurt
We dont mix to cook up
Look up the DNA strands
I make water you make dirt
Together we make mud 
Yep put it in a flower plant
I am sick and tired of you crying
And you sicker, and even more tired
Its safe to say that this thing has expired
Like time in a meter
She a dime when you meet her
First time that you beat you thinking 
Naw I never leave her
And I neva cheat
Now a 9 millimeter at your door cause you didnt come home
Huh?
And how the hell did we get here?
She found a red hair
And how the hell did it get there?
Man how the hell should I know this aint fair 
Love, trust, happiness
Naw it aint there
And it is, what it is
Its whatever
We obviously aint sposed to be, 
Together
Lets stop messin around
Put this thing in the ground
We gotta out out this thing in the ground
Is what the radio should sound like
Its what the club shoup sound like 
Compound
You know what it is
Im done
