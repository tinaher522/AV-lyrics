<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Want_Me_To_Stay">
Got my bags at the door
I'm getting ready to leave
Ohhh ohhh mmmm,,,
I can tell there's something u wanna say to me
Ohhh ohhh
Baby speak your mind
Cuz u're wasting time
It's a quarter to nine
And my car's on the way
You said u wasn't ready for this
So i'm at the door
Heard there's something on ur mind changed
Chorus:
If u want me to stay
If u want me to stay
Say u want me to stay
Baby stop playing around with me
There'll be no time to play
If u want me to stay
Baby u've got to show me
2nd verse:
Oohhh
Ur mind and ur mouth are saying 2 different things
Ooohhh ohhh mmmm
U need to figure it out ...i'm tired of waiting ohhh oooh
Being indecisive.. it comes with a price n' now ur time is almost gone mmm...
I'm hearing " go on and leave "
U dont care about me
But ur eyes r saying u want me home
Chorus:
If u want me to stay
If u want me to stay
Say u want me to stay
Baby stop playing around with me
There'll be no time to play
If u want me to stay
Baby u've got to show me
Show me u want me (*2)
Show me u want me babe (*3)
Baby show me that u care
Show me u want me babe
Showww meee... show meee
Show me u want me babe
Show me that u care ohhhhh
U've got to show me
Chorus:
If u want me to stay
If u want me to stay
Say u want me to stay
Baby stop playing around with me
There'll be no time to play
If u want me to stay
Baby u've got to show me
If u want me to stay
If u want me to stay
Say u want me to stay
Baby stop playing around with me
There'll be no time to play
If u want me to stay
Baby u've got to show me
