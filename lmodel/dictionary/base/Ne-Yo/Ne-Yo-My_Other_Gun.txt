<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="My_Other_Gun">
Hold me down with a thousand pounds on the shoulder
Lifts me up despite the stones, rocks, boulders
Soft and strong, right and wrong, anxious, patient
In her eyes ride or die ain't just a statement no
So much more than ride or die
She'll get on the trigger or take the wheel and drive
And I know if situations go arise
Then she's right there in the holster by my side
That's my other gun
That's my other eye
That's who got my back
When the world ain't on my side
She my other gun
Should I go to war
Holding me down
That's what she there for
She my other gun
She my other gun
Put me first even when I'm on my moment
Knows me well can't front her she see right through me
You rub my hand hold me when this world is troubling
Settle for that long you'll never want or need for nothing girl
So much more than ride or die
She'll get on the trigger or take the wheel and drive
And I know if situations go arise
Then she's right there in the holster by my side
That's my other gun
That's my other eye
That's who got my back
When the world ain't on my side
She my other gun
Should I go to war
Holding me down
That's what she there for
She's always locked and loaded
Ready for anything
She got me fully covered
I'm glad she's on my team
Custom grip perfect bid
All she's pictures me
Her and me, that's all I need
Makes us hard to be
My other gun
That's my other gun
That's my other eye
That's who got my back
When the world ain't on my side
She my other gun
Should I go to war
Holding me down
That's what she there for
She my other gun
