<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Licking_My_Fingers">
Ooooohhhhh... mmmm
Sitting around my place
Staring at the ceilings
Thinking about your ice cream skin...
Damn you make me lazy
When I get this feeling
I don't wanna do nothing
But think about the next time.. (oooh)
Another position..
Sexy poster put you in
It's like as soon as I get done
I'm asking permission; baby can I do it again?
Baby, baby 
When I think of you you got me licking my fingers
Thinking about the things you do..
Baby, baby 
When I think of you you got me biting my lip
Wondering when you gonna come back through
When I think of you you got me licking my fingers
Thinking about the things you do..
Baby, baby 
When I think of you you got me biting my lip
Wondering when you gonna come back through
Ooh driving in my car
Start to reminisce
When you was with me last 
In the back sit
One lil' bit too far
Caught my attention
Don't you know I almost crashed
Dnd even if I did;
That's ok
Because your sexual healing 
All I need to be alright
Fantasizing about you all day
Morning to the evening
I'm just toward the night
Oooh baby 
Baby, baby 
When I think of you you got me licking my fingers
Thinking about the things you do..
Baby, baby 
When I think of you you got me biting my lip
Wondering when you gonna come back through
When I think of you you got me licking my fingers
Thinking about the things you do..
Baby, baby 
When I think of you you got me biting my lip
Wondering when you gonna come back through
Wondering when you gonna come back through mmm x3
Oooh oooooh oooooooooh
Baby, baby 
When I think of you you got me licking my fingers
Thinking about the things you do..
Baby, baby 
When I think of you you got me biting my lip
Wondering when you gonna come back through
When I think of you you got me licking my fingers
Thinking about the things you do..
Baby, baby 
When I think of you you got me biting my lip
Wondering when you gonna come back through
