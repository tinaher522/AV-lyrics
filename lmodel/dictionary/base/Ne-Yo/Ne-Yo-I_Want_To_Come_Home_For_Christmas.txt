<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="I_Want_To_Come_Home_For_Christmas">
I'd give anything to see
A little Christmas tree
And to hear,
Hear the laughter of children playing in the snow, uh, uh
To kiss my baby under the mistletoe!
But I can't promise my eyes this sight
Unless they stop the fight
Cause I'm a prisoner of war
Lying here in my cell,
Hoping my family is well!
Wish they wouldn't worry so much about me
Just try to get us home
In time for the Christmas tree!
Oh, yes oh!
I want to see snow flakes fall
I want to see Santa Clause, oh
I wanna hear jingle bells ringing, oh, oh!
But I can't promise my eyes this sight
Oh, unless, unless they stop the fight!
Uh, uh, uh!
Trying to get home again, uh
I've tried to get home again
Trying to get home at Christmas time with you, yeah!
Trying to get home again, uh
I've tried to get home again
Trying to get home at Christmas time with you, yeah!
Oh, oh baby, oh baby
I wanted to see snow flakes falling
And I want to see Santa Claus
Oh, I wanna hear jingle bells ringing, ringing, ringing
Oh, I wanna hear jingle bells ringing, ringing, ringing
Oh, oh, oh I want to see snow flakes
And I want to see Santa Claus
I want to see snow flakes
And I want to see Santa Claus
