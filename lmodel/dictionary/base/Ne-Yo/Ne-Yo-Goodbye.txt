<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Goodbye">
Couldn't find the nice way
To say I'm leavin' today
Tried to write a letter
But curse words kept getting in the way
There has to be a nice way
To tell you how much I hate
The way you walk and talk and live and breathe and your very face.
I'm trying to spare your feelings
To tell you that I wish that you would die
That'd just be wrong of me
So this is my goodbye song
Thanks for nothin' you
So this is my goodbye song that I dedicate to you
Oh,
At first I was just gonna leave,
Let you wake up suddenly
And see that I'm no longer there (I'm no longer there)
But instead just for a laugh,
I left your apartment trashed.
And this CD on the stairs,
When you wake up and turn it on, 
You will hear this song
And by that time I'll be long gone.
So this is my goodbye song
Thanks for nothin' you
So this is my goodbye song 
That I dedicate to you
So this is my goodbye song
Thanks for nothin' you
So this is my goodbye song 
That I dedicate to you
That I dedicate to you
That I dedicate to you
That I dedicate to you
This is your song,
Hope  you enjoy it
This is your song,
Hope  you enjoy it
