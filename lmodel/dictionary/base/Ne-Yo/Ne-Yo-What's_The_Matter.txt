<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="What's_The_Matter">
[Verse:]
She wanted the money
The fame
The brand names
And fancy cars
She left her heart broken for a man behind
For a fellow with a championship ring
See here's the thing
Riding fancy
A superstar
She was one of like eight or nine
Just another ball players play thing
Now I'm singing
[Chorus:]
What's the matter with you baby
What's the matter with you baby
What's the matter with you
Cause it's your dream come true
What's the matter with you baby
What's the matter with you baby
What's the matter with you
