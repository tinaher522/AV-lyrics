Ahh...don't let me go.
This is a Jlack track man.
[Verse 1] 
If you listen to nothing else that I say,
Hear me when I say this to you,
That little voice in the back of your mind,
Just do what it tells you to do,
I saw her there,
Crying in two empty shot glasses,
Cheers to herself then drink them down,
I should've just walked away,
But there was something about her, 
(beautifully tragic)
Took a seat and said,
(So, you from outta town?)
[Chorus]
I should've known she was crazy,
I've seen it in her eyes,
She's crazy, (wohohoo)
I should've known she was crazy,
I did not realize
She's crazy, (wohohoo)
I should've known she was crazy, 
(she's crazy)
[Verse 2]
She looked at me,
And I swear the blood froze in my veins,
Her eyes pierced my heart and made it stop,
The room started spinning,
All of a sudden my vision was blurred,
And it got cold as I felt the temperature suddenly drop,
I'm getting scared now, 
But I don't show it,
But it's like she's looking through me,
So I think that she know it,
That's when she pulled me close, 
Holding me so tight,
Said I don't care about tomorrow, 
But your mine tonight,
[Chorus]
I should've known she was crazy,
I've seen it in her eyes,
She's crazy, (wohohoo)
I should've known she was crazy,
I did not realize
She's crazy, (wohohoo)
I should've known she was crazy, 
(she's crazy)
[Harmonizing]
Crazy (crazy)
What you do to me,
[Chorus]
I should've known she was crazy,
I've seen it in her eyes,
She's crazy, (wohohoo)
I should've known she was crazy,
I did not realize
She's crazy, (wohohoo)
I should've known she was crazy, 
(she's crazy)
