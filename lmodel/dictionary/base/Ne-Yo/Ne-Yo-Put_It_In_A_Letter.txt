(feat. Mic Little)
[Ne-Yo]
Compound is in the building
Ay yo Walt you got one wit this one dawg
What's goin' on everybody, it's your boy Ne-Yo
I want to take this time to introduce ya to somebody special
Now when I say special I mean unique
His name is Mic Little and he got something to say
Yo Mic talk to the people
[Verse 1]
Uw uw uw uw
Yeah yeah yeah
Aw yeah (aw yeah)
Yeah
Aw yeah (aw yeah)
Yeah
Aw yeah (aw yeah)
Yeah
Lately I been tryna tell ya somethin'
Tryna find the nerve but nothin' come to say it
I really really wanna know you (know you)
See you all the time you wit ya homegirls
And I'm knowin' that they probably gonna hate
If I try to approach you too
[Chorus 2x]
So I'm gonna put it in a letter (ohh)
Leave it in your locker (ohh)
Wait for you to hollaback
And let me know if you're down with that
[Verse 2]
Baby this is not a do you like me
Circle yes or no or even maybe
This is somethin' deeper (deeper)
All I want is for us to be together
But first I gotta meetcha
[Chorus 2x]
So I'm gonna put it in a letter (ohh)
Leave it in your locker (ohh)
Wait for you to hollaback
And let me know if you're down with that
[Verse 3: Ne-Yo]
Ay yo Walt, I don't normally do this
But it's a special occasion so here we go
Hold up a second playa, I've been peepin the scenery
You want the cutie smiling at you in the cafetery
I see your movements, I peep your mini macking
But there's a couple different ways that you can make it happen
You ain't the average running up on her as she walk
And plus you R&amp;B so you ain't even gotta talk
Writing it down has always helped me out when trying to get up
So you don't gotta sweat her
Think about it, find a pen and put it in a letter
[Chorus 2x]
So I'm gonna put it in a letter (ohh)
Leave it in your locker (ohh)
Wait for you to hollaback
And let me know if you're down with that
Uw uw uw uw
Yeah yeah yeah
Aw yeah (aw yeah)
Yeah
Aw yeah (aw yeah)
Yeah
Aw yeah (aw yeah)
Yeah
