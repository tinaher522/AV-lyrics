<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Mistakes">
Do i remind you of the pain
That he put you through girl
Is that the reason I'm to blame
Before i do it?
Is it be cause he threatened you badlyÂ ?
I always stand accused
Protecting yourself, from somebody else
I'm not Who's hurrying you girl?
And it's killing me girl knowing you compare me to him
Always guilty before the sin
I can't win
I can't win no!
I'll to anything to prove i love you
Baby girl but i refuse to
Pay for something that I didn't do
I love you, girl 
But i refuse to stay
Paying for his mistake
He left a scar across your heart
I understand girl
Don't let it his wrongs tear us apart
Cause girl I'm your man
Just because he did
You swear I'm cheating
You just think i don't care
Why must i do time for another man's crime?
Girl you know that ain't fair
And it's killing me girl knowing you compare me to him
Always guilty before the sin
I can't win
I can't win no!
I'll to anything to prove i love you
Baby girl but i refuse to
Pay for something that I didn't do
I love you, girl 
But i refuse to stay
Paying for his mistake
I know he did you wrong 
But tell me what does that have to do with me?
Trying to show you something real
Figure out what is going on?
Before you look up and I'll be gone
Oh I'll to anything to prove that i love you 
Baby girl but i refuse to
Pay for something that I didn't do
I love you say i love you
I'll to anything to prove i love you
Baby girl but i refuse to
Pay for something that I didn't do no
I love you, girl 
But i refuse to stay
Paying for his mistake
