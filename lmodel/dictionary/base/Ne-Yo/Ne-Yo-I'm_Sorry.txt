<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="I'm_Sorry">
Momma I'm sorry
You know I never meant to hurt you, no.
But I'm in love with the boy next door.
Momma, please understand
And momma I'm so sorry
But I don't think that I can let hem go
I'm in love with the boy next door
Starring at your picture
My vision is blur
My eyes are feeling petit
With every word.
They're trying to tell me
I'm only a kid and that I
Can't be in love
I don't know what it is.
And they keep trying to confince me that you ain't no good for me
(You're to young to know, baby, just let it go.)
And they just won't accept what we are
And what we can be
(So this letter reads)
Momma, please understand.
Momma I'm sorry
You know I never meant to hurt you, no.
But I'm in love with the boy next door.
Momma, please understand
And momma I'm so sorry
But I don't think that I can let hem go
I'm in love with the boy next door
Momma, please understand
And I know that she
Thinks that I'm yound and naeive
Don't know what's good for me
Think of your future
She says with tears in her eyes

(Don't throw away your dreams)
About loving some guy.
Momma please have more faith in me
you didn't raise a fool
I'm gonna stay by ya said though I know you don't want me to
So this letter reads.
Momma, please understand
Momma I'm sorry
You know I never meant to hurt you, no.
But I'm in love with the boy next door.
Momma, please understand
And momma I'm so sorry
But I don't think that I can let hem go
I'm in love with the boy next door
Momma, please understand
Nothing I can say to
Make you feel the way you feel
But finally i found the love 
that I know is real, really real
And I ain't gonna give it up
Not for nothing 
I ain't gonna give it up (noo)
So momma......
............................
Momma, Please understand!
Momma I'm sorry

But I'm in love with the boy next door.
Momma, please understand
And momma I'm so sorry
But I don't think that I can let hem go
I'm in love with the boy next door
Momma, please understand
