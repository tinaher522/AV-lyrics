<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Unconditional">
And I would do anything for you
Not in words, no I really mean it
Let the whole damn world declare war on me
Just for standing by your side
It's truly, you was the one way I survive
I'll gladly die a million
I would do anything for you
Unconditioned, unconditional love
And I would do anything for you
I'm talking unconditioned, unconditional love
And I would do anything for you
(For you, for you, for you)
Not words, let my actions speak
(Anything for you, for you, for you)
Let the sun decide that it won't shine until, I say that we are through
I would live my life in darkness just for you
I swear it's true, I mean it
I would do anything for you
Unconditioned-unconditional love
Oh oh
I would do anything for you
I'm talking unconditioned-unconditional love
Unconditional love
I'm talking unconditioned, unconditioned
Oh love
I'm talking unconditioned, unconditioned
I don't care about what's á¹—opular
I don't hear a word they say
What I know is that it's you and me until both of our dying day
Uuuh, oh, oh, oh
Hey, hey
I would do anything for you
Unconditioned-unconditional love
Oh uuah
I would do anything for you baby
Unconditioned-unconditional love
Oh oh
Unconditional, unconditional
Unconditional, unconditional
Unconditional, love
