<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="One_More">
Excuse me... 
You look like you just got off from work
And if I may assume, babe
You work hard but you don't get what you're worth
(Am I right?) Let me take another guess
You're a little stressed and I bet your feet hurt
No, I don't read minds, babe
I just know what it look like
When a woman work all night tryna get her thing right
I don't know where you've been
And I don't know what you've been through
But something's tellin' me you
You deserve a drink or two
(Bartender!)
Let me get one more for the lady
Let me get one more for the lady
Let me get one more for the lady
Let me get one more for the lady
(Whatever she wants)
Let me get one more for the lady
Let me get one more for the lady
(Whatever she wants)
Let me get one more for the lady
Let me get one more for the lady
(I don't know where you've been)
Let me get one more for the lady
Let me get one more for the lady
(And I don't know what you've been through)
Let me get one more for the lady
Let me get one more for the lady
(But something's tellin' me you...)
Let me get one more for the lady
Let me get one more for the lady
(I just been lookin' from across the room and I just wa' say sum')
(You deserve a drink or two)
Let me get one more for the lady
Let me get one more for the lady
(I mean, what I do is fair)
See I was thinkin', over in the corner while I been drinkin'
See you've probably been lookin' for way more out a weekend
Than freakin' and watchin' the sun by so high 
But you feel so nasty and don't know why
And you tried all the things that you wouldn't gon' try
Like kiss body parts that weren't on the guide
A bunch of girls in the bed, and there wasn't none divided
And there were no inhibition, and everybody wishin'
We done did this shit back then, why we didn't?
Hey and even if you went too far, it forgiven
You were high when you did it, everybody was trippin'
Promised you'd forget it, but everybody didn't
You like this ass doesn't land in the air, body mitten
And I don't just be lookin' on everybody's kitten
But you get in the room and my dick in the room
Make your forget about all the chicks in the room, like that
(Bartender!)
Let me get one more for the lady
Let me get one more for the lady
Let me get one more for the lady
Let me get one more for the lady
(Whatever she wants)
Let me get one more for the lady
Let me get one more for the lady
(Whatever she wants)
Let me get one more for the lady
Let me get one more for the lady
(I don't know where you've been)
Let me get one more for the lady
Let me get one more for the lady
(And I don't know what you've been through)
Let me get one more for the lady
Let me get one more for the lady
(But something's tellin' me you...)
Let me get one more for the lady
Let me get one more for the lady
(You deserve a drink or two)
Let me get one more for the lady
(You deserve a drink or two)
Let me get one more for the lady
Ain't gon' lie to you, baby
Wish I could take you somewhere more private
Ain't gon' lie to you, baby
Get all in your mind and see what's inside it
Ain't gon' lie to you
I want you, how could I not with a booty so fat?
I don't wanna get on your nerves and test your patience
I ain't tryna do that, no
Ain't gon' lie to you, baby
I would love the opportunity to rub your feet
Ain't gon' lie to you, baby
If you with it, I got somebody sexy you should meet
Ain't gon' lie to you
You had a long night, I'm just tryna help you end it right
So if I may be so bold, can I get you one more to go?
Let me get one more for the lady
Let me get one more for the lady
Let me get one more for the lady
Let me get one more for the lady
(Whatever she wants)
Let me get one more for the lady
Let me get one more for the lady
(Whatever she wants)
Let me get one more for the lady
Let me get one more for the lady
(I don't know where you've been)
Let me get one more for the lady
Let me get one more for the lady
(And I don't know what you've been through)
Let me get one more for the lady
Let me get one more for the lady
(But something's tellin' me you...)
Let me get one more for the lady
Let me get one more for the lady
(You deserve a drink or two)
Let me get one more for the lady
(You deserve a drink or two)
Let me get one more for the lady
If she don't like it, she don't like it
But you know what? Ten to one you do

'Cause ya love what I got to offer
