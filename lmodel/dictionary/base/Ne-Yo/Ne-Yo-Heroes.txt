<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Heroes">
Never doubt, never doubt
Here for you, here for me
Worry not, I'll be there
Strength when you feel weak
In the dark when you can't see
Guiding light, I will be
All I need, all I need
Is for you to do the same for me
Even heroes need heroes sometimes
And even the strong need someone to tell them it's alright
Even heroes need heroes sometimes
Will you be my hero tonight?
Just look up, up so high
Just above you is where I fly
But if I fall from the sky
On you can I rely?
I'll protect you from the world
Whenever I can
But will you do the same for me
Now and again
Even heroes need heroes sometimes
And even the strong need someone to tell them it's alright
Even heroes need heroes sometimes
Will you be my hero tonight?
Come to my, my rescue
Do for me, as I do for you
Be my guide when I am blind
'Cause no one can be strong all the time
Even heroes need heroes sometimes
Will you be my hero tonight?
Will you be my hero?
Even heroes need heroes sometimes 
Will you be my hero?
And even the strong need someone to tell them it's alright 
Will you be my hero?
Even heroes need heroes sometimes
Will you be my hero tonight?
(Will you be my hero?
Will you be my hero tonight?) - 3x
