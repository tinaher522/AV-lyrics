<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Can_You_Get_Away">
Champagne dress very small, very fitted
Body like a sports car, no speed limit 
She looking over here ,looking over here
Keep looking over here , looking over here 
Came in the club on the arm of another 
Why feedin him ,but she creep under cover 
She looking over here , looking over here  
Keep looking over here , looking over here. 
Really tryin to fight temptation, but this girl is testing my patience
She wanna go 
Smiling at me oh soo sexual (I can't take no more)
So I signal  her to the backroom  
Watch her tell him she goin to the bathroom  
What did occurred 
I Pulled her in and this is what I said to her:
I wanna do somehting  
Whatchuu you think about me showin you something 
Giving you the business 
Girl can you get away ,can you get away, 
Girl can you get away ,can you get away 
I wanna do somehting
Whatchuu you think about me showin you something  
Giving you the business
Girl can you get away ,can you get away, 
Girl can you get away ,can you get away
Kissin on my body, it was real hot and heavy 
She said,"Baby lets go cus im ready" 
Wait what bout your man , what bout your man  
Girl don't forget your man ,don't forget your man
I said baby we gunna handle the BI 
Let me get your numba go back to the VI, 
She wrote it in my hand , wrote it in my hand  
&amp;   went back to her man  
Back to her man
Sitting in the VI drinking 
Staring at me and I know what she thinking 
She wanna go , smiling at me oh so sexual (i cant take no more)  
Her man got up to go to the bathroom 
That's when I got up to make my move               
What did occur 
Walked over and sat right next to her, this what i said to her:
I wanna do somehting  
Whatchuu you think about me showin you something 
Giving you the business 
Girl can you get away ,can you get away, 
Girl can you get away ,can you get away 
I wanna do somehting
Whatchuu you think about me showin you something  
Giving you the business
Girl can you get away ,can you get away, 
Girl can you get away ,can you get away
