<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Everything's_Alright">
Everythings alright
Traveling across this desert
And my horse just died
Middle of no were 
But the sun shines right in my eyes
Though its truely beautiful
It just might take my life(my life)
But everything's alright
Whoaaaaa
Everythings alright
Whooaaa
Everythings alright right now
Whoaaa
Everythings alright
Whoooooaaaa
Everythings alright
Warm inside the day time but its
Oh so cold at night
The wind hits my skin like needles
But im just fine
Sleep beneath the lovely stars
And pray for morning time, tonight, 
Cause everythings alright
Whoaaaaa
Everythings alright
Whooaaa
Everythings alright right now
Whoaaa
Everythings alright
Whoooooaaaa
Everyday, that we live,  is a blessing
And every night, is a gift
When you wake in the morning
Know that not everyone is
Not everyone is
So everythings alright
Whoaaaaa
Everythings alright
Whooaaa
Everythings alright right now
Whoaaa
Everythings alright
Whoooooaaaa
Whoaaaaa
Said everythings alright
Whooaaa
I said everythings alright right now
Whoaaa
Said everythings alright
Whoooooaaaa
