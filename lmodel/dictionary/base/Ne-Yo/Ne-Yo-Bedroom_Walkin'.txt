<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Bedroom_Walkin'">
Got my damn mascara running down my face,
Crying buckets in the bathroom of this place
In the mirror
Asking how could this be?
Suddenly the mirror started talking back at me
Saying,
What the hell you doing?
Baby wipe your face,
Girl those tears are special
Don't let them go to waste,
Pull yourself together
We gon be okay,
Walk over to him and that chick
And this is what you say...
You aint worth my tears
You aint worth my time
There aint no love here
But im gon be just fine
You aint worth my tears
Onto something new
No more tears for you
No more tears for you
They'll be no more tears for you
Hey, and im alright
(and im alright)
Fix my hair
Make sure my make-up's reapplied
Regain my composure
Get back in my strive
(back in my strive)
Say to my mirror
Your new start is right outside
Walk up out the bathroom
He won't see me coming
He's sitting in the corner
(With a girl not a woman)
When i walk up
See the scared look on his face
I just smile
This is what i say...
You aint worth my tears
You aint worth my time 
There aint no love here 
But im gon be just fine 
You aint worth my tears 
Onto something new 
No more tears for you
No more tears for you 
They'll be no more tears for you
I have the might
To knock her out the chair
But im a lady
So i wont take it there
I can't believe 
That i shed tears for you
But we cry eyes
On telling you were through
You aint worth my tears
You aint worth my time 
There aint no love here 
But im gon be just fine 
You aint worth my tears
Onto something new 
No more tears for you (no more tears for you) 
No more tears for you (no more tears for you)
They'll be no more tears for you (no more tears for you)
No more tears for you
No more tears for you
They'll be no more tears for you
No more tears for you
No more tears for you
(Do buh do ru bo du buh
Do buh do ru bo duh buh)
