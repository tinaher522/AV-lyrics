Verse 1: I became her lover, she became my lover. Had her heart broke, I was helping her recover. I became the man she knew she could rely on. Somebody to listen or shoulder to cry on. She was getting better, better she was getting. The more time spent, the more she would forget him. But then back around he seen that he started coming, and shes on the low taking phone calls from him. I thought that we were building something strong. He apologizes and now your gone. And I won't put up with this. 
Pre-chorus: You wanna go. (Go.) Just hope you know. Baby your gonna be lonely, lonely again. Oh lonely, lonely. Go on go, go. Just hope you know. (Hey.) Baby your gonna be lonely, lonely again. Lonely, lonely again.
Chorus: Don't call me when your lonely again. When your lonely again, lonely again. Oh, sugga don't call me when your lonely again, when your lonely again. Lonely again. (Oh.) 
Verse 2: And I can't believe it, (No.) I really can't believe it. Never in a million years I couldn't see it. [ . . .]
