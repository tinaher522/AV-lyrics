<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Be_The_One">
I'm not gonna start no trouble
I'm not one that don't know to solve
But you're standing out here crying
I watched as I do drove off
Assuming that that's your man
Assuming that's y'all just your fault
I don't know the story
But assuming it wasn't your fault
Baby since you just won't do it right
Let me be the one
Let me show you what real love is like
And do the things you should have done
Baby since you just won't do it right
Let me be the one
Let me show you what real love is like
And do the things you should have done
Let me be the one
Now I know that you don't know me
But hear what I'm talking about
'Cause when I look at you what I see
Is we're trying to work it out
Now I don't know him so I can say that he's a bad dude
But is he really trying I think not
And all I'm saying is that if he won't make the effort
Let me give in a shot
Baby since you just won't do it right
Let me be the one
Let me show you what real love is like
And do the things you should have done
Baby since you just won't do it right
Let me be the one
Let me show you what real love is like
And do the things you should have done
Let me be what you want
Let me be what he's not
Let me show you real love
'Cause real love is all I got
Come on me off the rain
Calling me me do it right
Don't let me change your heart
And change your life oh woo
Girl let me be the one, be the one
Girl let me be the one, be the one
Girl let me be the one, be the one
Girl let me be the one, be the one
Oh la la la la la
La la la la la
Oh la la la la la
Baby since you just won't do it right
Let me be the one
Let me show you what real love is like
And do the things you should have done
Baby since you just won't do it right
Let me be the one
Let me show you what real love is like
And do the things you should have done
