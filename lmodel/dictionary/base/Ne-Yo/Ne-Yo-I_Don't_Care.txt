<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="I_Don't_Care">
Let them hate if they wanna
Let them hate if they wanna
Let them hate if they wanna
Let them hate if they wanna
Verse1
All you friends keep saying you can do better
With somebody else
Saying I'm dangerous and you can do bad
All by yourself
Everybody got something to say,
They don't even wanna see
While they talk so badly,
I actually make you happy
All that matters is us anyway, 
I don't even give a damn  
For You I'm a better man, 
So tell them, if they wanna hate they can
Chorus, 
Let them talk about us
Let them hate if they wanna
I don't care
I don't care, no matter what they say about us
Let them hate if they wanna
We ain't going nowhere, going nowhere, no
Verse 2,
Everybody says you're too slow for me and the life I live
You ain't out in the club all night
You wanna be the quiet part of my life
They don't understand how beautiful that is
Everybody got something to say, they don't even wanna see
While they talk so badly, I actually make you happy
All that matters is us anyway, and I don't even give a damn
For you I'm a better man, so tell them, if they wanna hate they can
Chorus 
Let them talk about us
Let them hate if they wanna
I don't care
I don't care, no matter what they say about us
Let them hate if they wanna
We ain't going nowhere, going nowhere, no
Verse 3
Let them hate if they wanna, I don't care
No matter what baby we ain't going nowhere
Let them hate if they wanna, I don't care
No matter what baby we ain't going nowhere
Chorus 
Let them talk about us
Let them hate if they wanna
I don't care
I don't care, no matter what they say about us
Let them hate if they wanna
We ain't going nowhere, going nowhere, no
Let them talk about us
Let them hate if they wanna
I don't care
I don't care, no matter what they say about us
Let them hate if they wanna
We ain't going nowhere, going nowhere, no
Let them hate if they wanna, I don't care
No matter what baby we ain't going nowhere
