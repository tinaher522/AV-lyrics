(Featuring Jin) 
(Jin) 
I'm so sick 
It happened so quick 
looking at old flicks 
Trying to figure out where we went wrong 
The radio turns on 
had some song waiting to hear 
both of our favorite parts 
each word is eating at my heart 
alot of you aint gotta a boo 
trying to move on 
Ne-yo tell em what's the first thing they gotta do 
(Ne-Yo) 
Gotta change my answering machine 
Now that I'm alone 
Cuz right now it says that we 
Can't come to the phone 
And I know it makes no sense 
Cus you walked out the door 
But it's the only way I hear your voice 
Anymore 
(It's ridiculous) 
It's been months for some reason I just 
(Can't get over us) 
And I'm stronger than this 
(Enough is enough) 
No more walking 'round with ma head down 
I'm so over being blue 
Crying over you 
(Chorus) 
And I'm so sick of love songs 
So tired of tears (Jin) I'm so sick 
So done with wishing 
You were still here 
Said I'm so sick of love songs 
So sad and slow (Jin) I'm so sick 
So why can't I turn off the radio? 
(Jin) Verse 2 
(Ne-yo) 
Gotta fix that calender I had 
That's marked July 15th 
Cuz since there's no more you 
There's no more anniversery (Jin) Ain't no more 
I'm so fed up with my thoughts of you 
And your memories 
And now every song reminds me 
Of what used to be 
(Chorus) 
That's the reason 
I'm so sick of love songs 
So tired of tears (Jin) I'm so sick 
So done with wishing 
You were still here 
Said I'm so sick of love songs 
So sad and slow (Jin) I'm so sick 
So why can't I turn off the radio? 
O-o-h(Jin) lets go (Ne-yo)leave me alone 
(Jin) 
Tird of dealing with the frustration 
(Ne-yo) 
Leave me alone (Stupid love song) 
(Jin) 
same song even when i change the station 
(Ne-yo) 
Hey, 
Don't make me think about her smile 
(Jin) 
She's crafty 
(Ne-yo) 
Or having my first child 
(Jin) 
your boy Jin 
(Ne-yo) 
Then lettin go 
Turning of the radio 
(Jin) 
Time to let go if your with me turn off the radio 
(Chorus x3) 
Cuz I'm so sick of love songs 
So tired of tears (Jin) I'm so sick 
So done with wishing 
She were still here 
Said I'm so sick of love songs 
So sad and slow (Jin) I'm so sick 
So why can't I turn off the radio? 
(So why can't I turn off the radio?) 
Why can't I turn off the radio?
