Lies
Pile on top of more lies
Lookin me dead in my eyes
Talkin bout 
Baby its only you
Why dont you trust me
A disguise
Cus thats all it was a disguise
Took me a minute to find out
But now i finally see
I finally realize
You dont love me
(oh, oh, oh, oh)
&amp; it dont matter what you say
You dont love me
(oh, oh, oh, oh)
Cus love dont do you that way
You dont love me
Dont try to hide it
You dont love me
U cant deny it
You dont love me
So there's no reason to stay
Cus you don't love me
You dont love me
Oh, oh oh no
Oh, oh oh no
Oh, oh oh no
Oh, oh oh no
You dont love me
Oh, oh oh no
Oh, oh oh no
Oh, oh oh no
Oh oh
No 
All you tell me is no
If i ask you the reason
I dont kno this lipstick
Its cus its from another girl
(is it cus its from another girl oh baby)
I dont kno
Baby i really dont kno
What it is that kept me holdin on
I was all in another world
Now i realize
You dont love me
(oh, oh, oh, oh)
&amp; it dont matter what you say
You dont love me
(oh, oh, oh, oh)
Cus love dont do you that way
You dont love me
Dont try to hide it
You dont love me
U cant deny it
You dont love me
So there's no reason to stay
Cus you don't love me
You dont love me
Oh, oh oh no
Oh, oh oh no
Oh, oh oh no
Oh, oh oh no
You dont love me
Oh, oh oh no
Oh, oh oh no
Oh, oh oh no
Oh oh
Right now i feel so
Good about myself
Got over you
Now im good with anything else
And baby there'll be no more waitin for you
Wonderin what u gon do
Im gon be just fine by myself
And baby there'll be no more cryin at night
Dont worry im alright
Im just fine with knowin 
You dont love me
You dont love me
(oh, oh, oh, oh)
&amp; it dont matter what you say
You dont love me
(oh, oh, oh, oh)
Cus love dont do you that way
You dont love me
Dont try to hide it
You dont love me
Said u cant deny it
You dont love me
So there's no reason to stay
Cus you don't love me
You dont love me
Oh, oh oh no
Oh, oh oh no
Oh, oh oh no
Oh, oh oh no
Cus you dont love me
You dont love me
Oh, oh oh no
Oh, oh oh no

Dont try to hide it
You dont love me
Said u cant deny it
You dont love me
So there's no reason to stay
Cus you don't love me
