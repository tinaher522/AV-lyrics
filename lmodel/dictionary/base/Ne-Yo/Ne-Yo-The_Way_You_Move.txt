<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="The_Way_You_Move">
She work at Onyx but she say it’s only temporary
It’s been 3 years and she’s still here and now it’s gettin’ scary
Says she don’t wanna dance forever, I look at her with my face like
Why? Why?
She’s super sexy everybody wanna know 'bout her
And when that everybody want to know the thing about her
Because the way she get it in,
All of the men, even the women all try, all try
Shawty’s so incredible
Body language she’s a poet
She’s so bad and what’s so sad
Is she doesn’t even know it
Little mama understand
The way you do the things you do nobody else can
And you can probably get whatever from whatever man
Cause shawty do what’s in your soul
Still it’d be a shame to see you go
Cause the way you move, uh, uh
Girl the way you move
Girl you got them like uuh,
Girl the way you move
Girl you saw the truth
Can’t take my eyes away from you
Girl the thangs you do
Girl you keep them like uuh
Baby I love the way you move
Girl if this club was the sky,
You’re the brightest star
You ain’t playing fair sliding down that pole like
What? Drop a couple stacks on you that’s nothing
Hundred after hundred girl a nigga ain’t fronting
You ain't in the club then I ain't coming
Say she’s tired of all that bullshit
Gonna quit the game, change your life and ease your pain
Hold up, work so hard it’s time to play
Baby girl take it off the tray
Shawty’s so incredible
(Oh, if you wanna leave girl)
Body language she’s a poet
(Oh, you should come with me girl)
She’s so bad and what’s so sad
(You’re the baddest thing I been hit, don’t you know)
Is she doesn’t even know it
Little mama understand
The way you do the things you do nobody else can
And I know that you can get whatever from whatever man
Baby do what’s in your soul
But it’d be a shame to see you go
Cause the way you move, uh girl
Oh girl, the way you move (Uhu, the way you do)
It’s the way you move
Girl you saw the truth (The truth baby)
Can’t take my eyes away from you
And the thangs you do
Girl you got them like uuh
Baby I love the way you move
Now, I never felt like this before
Which is why I brought some friends along to help me express it
A little better
I got one more friend who I wanna talk to
A little more experienced in this department
Pain, talk to her
I never seen nobody work it quite just like you baby
I gotta tell you I’m starting to like it baby
And it’s crazy cause you don’t wanna be here
I see it in your eyes, eyes
Stop listening to them girls in that locker room
Just keep doing your thang, don’t let it stop you boo
And if you heard some things about me
Girls they’re all lies, lies
She looks so incredible
Body language she’s a poet
She’s so bad and what’s so sad
Is she doesn’t even know it
The more I drink, the more you look like wife material
If you are ready to ride with me girl here we go
You hit the stage and then you make the music stop
Then your booty go left cheek, right cheek
Girl, I love the way you move
Got me like uuh
Girl I love the way you move, whoa
Girl I love the way you move
Girl you saw the truth
Can’t take my eyes away from you
It’s the thangs you do
Girl you keep them like uuh
Baby I love the way you move
Baby don’t go, don’t
Baby don’t go, don’t
Baby don’t go, don’t
