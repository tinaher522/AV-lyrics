<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="I_Don't_Really_Care">
I don't really care (I don't really care)
I don't really care (I don't really care)
Say, say your friends don't like me, stay talkin bout me, stay tellin you I'm doing wrong
Say, let em say what they wanna say, mad cause they lonely, nothing is still going strong, so I don't really care
Let em hate me, I don't really care, as long as my baby, is standing right here, right beside me, they can do whatever they wanna do
I don't really care, it don't phase me, I don't really care, as long as I got my baby, I don't really care, let em hate me, and they can do whatever they wanna do
Say, stay tryna tell you, they think you should do, treating you like you aint got your own damn mind, but you're a grown ass woman, and that's what they don't understand, but if they don't got a better way to spend their time, fine
So I don't really care
Let em hate me, I don't really care, as long as my baby, is standing right here, right beside me, they can do whatever they wanna do
There aint a damn thing they can do to me
I don't really care, it don't phase me, I don't really care, as long as I got my baby, I don't really care, let em hate me, and they can do whatever they wanna do
There aint a damn thing they can do to me, baby as long as it's you and me, hate if you want, let them hate if they want,
Baby, as long as you believe in me, there aint no defeating me, so hate if you want, let them hate if they want
So I don't really care
Let em hate me, I don't really care, as long as my baby, is standing right here, right beside me, they can do whatever they wanna do
There aint a damn thing they can do to me
I don't really care, it don't phase me, I don't really care, as long as I got my baby, I don't really care, let em hate me, and they can do whatever they wanna do
