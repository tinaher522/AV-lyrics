<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="How_Do_I">
We back at it baby
It's loso in case you ain't know so
That boy Ne-yo
Chill out shorty we do this
You see I met her at a party the album release
I told her I switch dates like the album release
And when it come to the style I'm a beast
Swagga is crazy
I should be in a asylum at least
&amp; uhm I'm a gentleman I open the doors
So I'm opin in more than Oprah at 4
I does my thing and I hope you do yours
Cuz my shit is so dope
You wont cope with withdrawal?
They like nope we want more
Shorty I could sell it like I tell it
I should open a store
But I don't do the drama
Really think ima come blow it up like a suicide bomba
Might give you a wink
Might send you a drink
Could be nothing
It might be what you think
And either way it play I'm still loso
Had to give it to you baby
In case you didn't know so
I've got a few different women
Told you from the beginning
Girl don't act brand new
I tried to be honest said if so tell me why you trippin
You know how I do
Why you callin screamin bout some place that I was seen in with somebody else
You really need to get a hold of yourself girl
Heyyy
If you're asking me if I was out with a little sexy thing in a tight red dress
Well if you must know the answers yes
Riddle me this
When we started chillin
Didn't I say that I aint willin to be your boyfriend
Take it or leave
Riddle me that
If I kept it real &amp; you said you wanted me still
So why the hell are you screamin at me
About the fact that
I've got a few different women
Told you from the beginning
Girl don't act brand new
I tried to be honest said if so tell me why you trippin
You know how I do
Ohhh heyy
Did I say anything to you
When I spotted you with some dude
From around your way
I saw you just the other day
Yeee
No didn't even mess wit it
Cuz real talk ain't my business
You ain't my lady
Do you thing play how you play
Riddle me this
If you be out havin fun
Kickin it with this one that one
&amp; I don't give you no flack about that girl
Riddle me that
If I don't get in your stuff
Baby wont you tell me what
Gives you the right to be all on my back
About the fact that
I've got a few different women
Told you from the beginning
Girl don't act brand new
I tried to be honest said if so tell me why you trippin
You know how I do
Oh baby let me break it down
It's all about honesty
So baby girl why you wanna trip on me
Said it's all about honesty
I kept it real
I kept it real girl
You wanna run in these streets
Wanna run in these street
But don't be mad when you see me
Said it's all about honesty
I kept it real
