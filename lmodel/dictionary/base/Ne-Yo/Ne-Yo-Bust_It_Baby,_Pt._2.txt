[Plies:]
Bust it baby
Ay can I please talk to my
Bust it babies real quick homie,
Let me bring you in my world (Plies) and
Let you know what I call a bust it baby
[Chorus: Ne-Yo]
She got me speedin' in the fast lane,
Pedal to the floor man, tryna get back to her love, her love
Best believe she got that good thing,
She my lil' hood thing, ask around they know us, know us
They know that's my (bust it) baby
Everybody know that's my (bust it) baby
Everybody know that's my
[Verse 1: Plies]
If I wasn't married to the streets, it would be you
Your lips, what make you so cute
Love when you poke yo mouth when you mad to,
Save yo number in my phone under lil' boo
Like yo sex, but in more love with what you do,
Turn me on how you stare at me when we through
When you give it to me, I don't wanna turn ya loose
Scared to moan round ya, so all I could say is ooh
My favorite panties uh yours, are the ones that see through
One with the pink trim on em, and they light blue
Speakin' for the goons, thank god for makin' you
Bust it baby, is what I call you
[Chorus: Ne-Yo]
[Verse 2: Ne-Yo]
Yea yea (so now),
They say he's an entertainer, (slow down)
Your just one more, (he don't respect you)
He just gone hurt you and neglect you
Well let em say what they wanna (yeah)
I made a promise (yeah),
To do you right and I'm gonna (hey)
Girl I do everything I can,
To prove I'm a better man,
Than your friends think I am
[Chorus: Ne-Yo]
[Verse 3: Plies]
I just gave her a nickname, it's wet-wet,
Cause when we finish, she mess up all my bed set
She got sum to relax me when I'm under stress,
Neva told her, or let her know, but she the best
She like to spell her name with her tongue on my chest,
If you would a told me it was this good, I would never guessed
She full o surprises, I don't know what shell do next
But while she sleep, I'll sneak and put hickies on her neck
And when she go, she shut down the hole set,
Love to see her in heels, with the slit in her dress
She like to do her own hair, get her own check,
My bust it baby, I keep her on deck
[Chorus: Ne-Yo]
