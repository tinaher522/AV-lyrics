If you dont got it
Ill go get it
It aint a thang
And if its broken
Ill fix it
I dont complain
But now, things are getin a little of hand
Cookin, cleanin, providin, takn care of little man
You wanna talk about whose wearin the pants
Baby wel i dont under stand
If you gon be the man, then be the man
Cause if u cant, baby i can
I can and i will so 
Figya it out
Which one of us gon be the man of the house
If you gon be the man, then be the man
Cause if u cant, baby i can
I can and i will so 
Figya it out
Which one of us gon be the man of the house
Boy i just
Dont get it
You aint supossed to act like a little boy
Just cause im independent
U wanna walk around with your chest out
Like you the one
But if i dont do it
Then it dont get done
Im a good woman
But im not dumb
Is you gon be my man or my son
If you gon be the man, then be the man
Cause if u cant, baby me i can
I can and i will so 
Figya it out
Which one of us gon be the man of the house
If you gon be the man, then be the man
Cause if u cant, baby i can
I can and i will so 
Figya it out
Which one of us gon be the man of the house
And im sick and tired of
Being the boss for us
No this aint the kind of love
Its supossed to be
You wana be
King of the castle(mmm)
You wana be captain(aye)
Well you gon have to work hard for that to happen
If you gon be the man, then be the man
Cause if u cant, baby i can
I can and i will so 
Figya it out
Which one of us gon be the man of the house
If you gon be the man, then be the man
Cause if u cant, baby i can
I can and i will so 
Figya it out
Which one of us gon be the man of the house
If you gon be the man, then be the man
Cause if u cant, baby i can
I can and i will so 
Figya it out
Which one of us gon be the man of the house
If you gon be the man, then be the man
Cause if u cant, baby i can
I can and i will so 
Figya it out
Which one of us gon be the man of the house
