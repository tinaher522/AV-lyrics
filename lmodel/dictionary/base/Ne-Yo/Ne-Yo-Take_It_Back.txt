<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Take_It_Back">
Maybe it wasn't right girl
Want me to leave in the mornin
And stay away through the night girl 
And not even think of callin you 
Difficult to admit girl
When Im wrong admit will cry
But if it means stayin by our side 
I won't hesitate to apologize girl..
Stupid mistakes 
Im gonna make them
Its gonna take a lil time to get it right umm...
I have a habit of actin
Before i think up what could possibly happen girl
But, but the tears in your eyes yea..
Telling me I really messed up this time
I wanna make it good
Baby, If I could
I absolutely would just..
Take it back
Take it back
Umm..
Anything that made you cry
Baby girl if I could
Take it Back
Take it Back
Said, I make sure you never hurt again
Umm.. If I could 
Take it Back
Take it back hrr
Baby I would guarantee
You would never be 
Force to hear me say Im sorry again 
If I could take it back girl
Maybe I wasn't right girl
To tell ya that I was somewhere 
That I wasnt at the other night girl 
I could of kept it real 
But it was
Easier to tell a lie girl
If I could do it all again (do it all again)
That was the way it would of been (way it would of been)
Ohhno
Stupid mistakes 
Im gonna make them
Its gonna take a lil time to get it right hey...
I have a habit of actin
Before i think up what could possibly happen girl
But, but the tears in your eyes yea..
Telling me I really messed up this time
