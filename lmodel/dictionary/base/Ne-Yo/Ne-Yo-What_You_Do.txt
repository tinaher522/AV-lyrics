<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="What_You_Do">
Hey, hey
Say it with your actions
Sayin them words to me
Doesnt mean anything
Hey, hey
I dont wana hear em
Baby you can keep those three
Might as well not even speak
Many different times before
You were almost out the door
Then you'd say it and i'd forgive everything
Well im sorry to report
Thats not workin anymore
Now i gotta see if thats really what you mean
No more 
Im sorry's 
No more 
I love you
Baby
I need proof
Baby boy
Its all in what you
No more 
I love you's
Baby
If thats true
Baby boy
Its all in what you do
Say it with your actions
Say it in the way you touch 
Things that you do for us
Hey hey
Said i dont wana be mean
But when it comes to this love
Sayin it just aint enough
Many different times before
You were almost out the door
Then you'd say it and i'd forgive everything
Well im sorry to report
That aint gon work, not anymore
Now i gotta see if thats really what you mean
No more 
Im sorry's 
No more 
I love you
Baby
I need proof
Baby boy
Its all in what you
No more 
I love you's
Baby
If thats true
Baby boy
Its all in what you do
Its in what you
Its, its in what you do
(x3)
No more 
Im sorry's 
No more 
I love you
Baby
I need proof
Baby boy
Its all in what you
No more 
I love you's
Baby
If thats true
Baby boy
Its all in what you do
