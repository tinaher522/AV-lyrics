<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="To_Be_Continued">
So she mad at me yet again; 
'Cus my phone keeps ringing.
And we was right in the middle of it.
I understand 'cus I know she love it.
As we was just about to get it on, 
I hear my manager's ringtone.
So I gotta get up, I know it's the worst, 
But the business comes first girl.
Ring ring there goes my phone.
I got to get it, see what's going on
We wasn't finished baby I know
Girl I'm so sorry but I got to go
I'll tell you what, next time we meet
No phones allowed, just you and me
But girl for now, I got to leave, 
So 'til the next time I see ya... 
To be continued [oh], to be continued [oh]
To be continued [oh], to be continued [ohoh]
To be continued [this isn't over, over]
To be continued [I know what I owe ya, owe ya]
To be continued [oh], to be continued [ooooh]
If I could take time and turn it back
I would redo every time that, I had to leave in the middle of a session
I know when you don't get to finish you'll be stressin'
But girl I gotta keep my business tight
Gotta make sure regardless we alright
Make sure I can keep giving you the things in life
Even if it means leaving you alone tonight girl
Ring ring there goes my phone
I got to get it, see what's going on
We wasn't finished baby I know
Girl I'm so sorry but I got to go
I'll tell you what, the next time we meet
No phones allowed, just you and me
But girl for now, I got to leave, 
So 'til the next time I see ya... 
To be continued [oh], to be continued [oh]
To be continued [oh], to be continued [ohoh]
To be continued [this isn't over, over]
To be continued [I know what I owe ya, owe ya]
To be continued [oh], to be continued [ooooh]
Girl the suspense, just makes it better for you
'Cus you don't know what I got planned for you baby
Tune in next week, when this episode will conclude
A happy ending for me and you
To be continued... Until I see you again baby
'Til I see you again baby... 
To be continued [oh], to be continued [oh]
To be continued [oh], to be continued [ohoh]
To be continued [this isn't over, over]
To be continued [I know what I owe ya, owe ya]
To be continued [oh], to be continued [ooooh]
