<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Sexy_Love">
My sexy love... (so sexy...)
She makes the hairs on the back of my neck stand up
Just one touch
And I errupt like a volcano and cover her with my love
Baby girl you make me say (ohh ohhh ohhhh)
And I just can't think (of anything else I'd rather do)
Than to hear you sing (sing my name the way you do)
When we do our thing (when we do the things we do)
Baby girl you make me say (ohh ohhh ohhhh)
Sexy love girl the things you do
(Oh baby baby) Keep me sprung keep running back to you
Who I love making love to you
Baby girl you know you're my (sexy love...)
I'm so addicted to her she's the sweetest touch
Just enough
Still too much say that I simp and I'm sprung all of the above
I can't help she makes me say (ohh ohhh ohhhh)
And I just can't think (of anything else I'd rather do)
Than to hear you sing (sing my name the way you do)
When we do our thing (when we do the things we do)
Oh, baby girl you make me say (ohh ohhh ohhhh)
Sexy love girl the things you do
(Oh baby baby) Keep me sprung keep running back to you
Who I love making love to you
Say baby girl you know you're my (sexy love...)
Oh baby what we do it makes the sun come up
Keep on lovin' till it goes back down
And I don't know what I'd do if I would lose your touch
That's why I'm always keepin' you around... my sexy love
Sexy love girl the things you do (things you do baby)
(Oh baby baby) Keep me sprung keep running back to you (keep me runnin' back to you)
Who I love making love to you
Say baby girl you know you're my (sexy love...)
Sexy love girl the things you do (sexy love)
Keep me sprung keep running back to you (keep me runnin' back to you)
Who I love making love to you
Say baby girl you know you're my (sexy love...)
She makes the hairs on the back of my head stand up
Just one touch...
