<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Start_A_Fire">
Come lay down with me tonight
We can start a fire here and 
I'll be wrong and you'll be right
We can start a fire here 
And watch you climb these walls (walls)
Our bodies create the flames and
Loves blaze conquers all (all)
Close your eyes and take me as i sing
Come lay down with me tonight
We can start a fire here and 
I'll be wrong and you'll be right
We can start a fire here
Tonight x 4
Watch the flames just stay
When i kiss you sparks light up this night
Girl take my hand
Squeeze it as i enter you singing
Come lay down with me tonight 
We can start a fire here and
I'll be wrong and you'll be right
We can start a fire here
Tonight x 4
Your body 
My body 
Together
So we'll start a fire here tonight
Your body 
My body 
Together
So we'll start a fire here tonight
Come lay down with me tonight 
We can start a fire here and
I'll be wrong and you'll be right
We can start a fire here
Tonight
