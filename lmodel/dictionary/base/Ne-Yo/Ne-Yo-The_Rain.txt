<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="The_Rain">
27th of January
I think about
A year ago today
She's crying
On my shoulder
Begging me to make
The hurtin go away
Pretty brown eyes
Tears full of gifts
Heart full of pain
And fear
Want to tell her
It's okay
But we both know
She's the reason
He's not here
I keep on crying
But it don't seem
To help at all
Every single tear drop
Is like another rain
Drop falls
And I would if I could
But the try
Would be in cain
Cause no matter
What I do
I can't stop the rain
So I cry whooooohooo
Whooooohooo
Whooooohooo
I can't stop the rain
Can't stop the rain
Whoooooooohoooo
I can't stop the rain
Can't stop the rain
(If I could know
I would but the try
Would be in vain)
