<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Lonely_Again">
I became her lover
She became my lover
Had her heart broke
I was helping her recover
I became the man she knew she could rely on
Somebody to listen, a shoulder to cry on
She was gettin' better
Better she was gettin'
The more time spent
The more she would forget him
But then back around to scene he started coming
Now she's on the low, takin' phone calls from him
I thought that we were building something strong
He apologizes and now you're gone
And i wont put up with this
You wanna go, go
Just hope you know
Baby you're gonna be
Lonely, lonely again (oohw)
Lonely, lonely
Come on, go, go
Just hope you know (hey)
Baby you're gonna be
Lonely, lonely again
Lonely, lonely again
Dont call me when you're lonely again
When you're lonely again
Lonely again (oohw)
Sugar dont call me when you're lonely again
When you're lonely again
Lonely again (oohw)
And i cant believe it (no)
Really cant believe it
Never in a million years, i couldnt see it
I pulled her from the flames, so she don't expire
She turn around and jumped right back in the fire
What are you doing
How could you do it
Back to the flames, baby thats just stupid
Had me feeling bad for you, so foolish (whatever)
Now you deserve what you get (whoow)
I thought that we were building something strong
He apologizes and now you're gone
Said that i wont put up with it
You wanna go, go
Just hope you know
Baby you're gonna be
Lonely, lonely again (oohw)
Lonely, lonely
Come on, go, go
Just hope you know
Baby you're gonna be
Lonely, lonely again
Lonely, lonely again
Dont call me when you're lonely again
When you're lonely again
Lonely again (oohw)
Sugar dont call me when you're lonely again
When you're lonely again
Lonely again (ohhw)
Hey girl
I picked you up when you're down
Didn't do it so you, could lay back on the ground
I just dont understand
You must like punishment
If you get hurt again
Just remember that you asked for it
Hey hey hey hey heyyy
Oohw woohww
You wanna go, go
Just hope you know
Baby you're gonna be
Lonely, lonely again (oohw)
Lonely, lonely
Come on, go, go
Just hope you know
Baby you're gonna be
Lonely, lonely again
Lonely, lonely again
Dont call me when you're lonely again
When you're lonely again
Lonely again (oohw)
Sugar dont call me when you're lonely again
When you're lonely again
Lonely again (ohw)
