<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Think_Like_A_Man">
You gotta act like a woman
And think like a a man
Why you call me your dream bed
And foolish of me I believe that
You said every king needs his queen babe
That's why you needed me baby
Right in between lost and love
You go and mess things up
Now there's no we babe
There's just you and there's me baby
There was us, there was trust
There was happen and change, I know
Silly you, silly me, silly us, what I've wait
But in love, love, love
You gotta act like a woman and think like a man
But in love, love, love
You gotta act like a woman and think like a man
Now I'm gonna keep it realer with you now that I ever been
Wish we would never been, girl we was better friends
You didn't had to tell me, what went right and when
Um why I didn't need it
Cause you wasn't my girlfriend, we had a good thing
You were a combining hitting, ooh give me that good thang
Then after we were finished
You go your way, I go my way, it was whatever
Tell me what ever happens
Think this wanna gonna be better
And now I'm telling you lies
All because I hate to see the tears in your eyes
Of course I want my cake, and needed too, I'm a guy
And of course, you don't understand
But you would if you thought like a man in love
But in love, love, love
You gotta act like a woman and think like a man
But in love, love, love
You gotta act like a woman and think like a man
Time cost money and it's so expensive
Versace, lenny got these women blowing kisses
Leaning on my auto, she's so photogenic
Can I take a picture, she's my mona lisa
Living like a princess in a fairy tale
You know them people up in barney show and tell
Bentley black and not a ninja see no poney tail
5 karat yellow diamond you don't know me well
Penthouse, set the drunks, it don't call and sell
She called the night at twom I had to call the cab
You don't understand it's altitude I'm balling at
I'm at the game on the wood where the owner at
Soldiers from 'bout the same
Boy you tell me everything
Yeah you show me how you think
You're the only one to blame
It's such a shame
Yeah should lost the game you tell me how to play
In love, love, love
You gotta act like a woman, and think like a man
But in love, love, love
You gotta act like a woman and think like a man
Act like a woman, act like a woman
Gotta act like a woman
