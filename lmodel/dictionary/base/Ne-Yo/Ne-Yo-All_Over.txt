<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="All_Over">
Do what you want baby
Do what you want
Do what you want baby
Do what you want
Get over there put your hands in your pockets
Watch me walk over to the door and lock it
Put your eyes anywhere
Let me quickly give a good reason to stare
Ill walk back to my sexy most slowly 
We can do whatever you want to 
But only if you follow my command
Stop i didn't say you could use your hands
Ooohh
In this game there is a lesson to be taught 
The purpose is to export the power of our very thoughts
And see if you can
Chorus
Oh touch me with your mouth baby
Think about it so hard till i feel it all over
All over 
All over
Can you move me with your mouth baby
Think about is so good till i feel it all over
All over
All over
Standing at attention but your still sitting 
Baby i can tell that the thought that im getting
Kinda good to ya
Think of everything that you want me to do to ya
And ill do it to you
Dont close your eyes or you wont see me dancing
Watch how i move baby 
It is enhancing
The stemulation  feel
Woahh
Chorus
Oh touch me with your mouth baby
Think about it so hard till i feel it all over
All over 
Feel it all over
All over
Can you move me with your mouth baby
Think about is so good till i feel it all over
Feel it all over
All over
Give it to me 
Cos were mentally
And the physical sure to come
Lets do the teleconatic
Promise you wont regret it
Once the game is done
Tell us what you want donee
Do what you want
Oh touch me with your mouth baby
Think about it so hard till i feel it all over
All over 
All over
Can you move me with your mouth baby
Think about is so good till i feel it all over
All over
Feeel it all over
All over
Ooh touch me with your mouth baby
Think about it so hard till i feel it all over
All over 
All over
Can you move me with your mouth baby
Think about is so good till i feel it all over
All over
Feel it all over
All over
