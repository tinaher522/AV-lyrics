<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="It's_Over">
Tired as hell and I can't catch my breath 
Been fighting so long I just aint got nothing left, Are we done?
Cause I can't take it anymore, I just cant take it 
Been so long since I was close enough to smell your smell
You're telling me the love is still good, if it is girl I can't tell, Are we done?
Cause I can't take it anymore, said I just can't take it 
Oh girl there ain't no tears to cry
I think its over, I think its over
We both know this love has died
I think its over, I think its over
Cause I just can't take it anymore
You say in trippin when I tell you that we've changed
But your friends, my friends and everybody saying the same thing, Are we done?
Cause I can't take it anymore, I just can't take it 
I've been noticing the way you get dressed up to go to the store
And its right around the corner but you'll be gone for an hour sometimes more
I ain't the one, and I can't take it anymore, said I just can't take it anymore
Oh girl there ain't no tears to cry
I think its over, I think its over
We both know this love has died
I think its over, I think its over
Cause I just can't take it anymore? just can't take it anymore
We can be honest, we have no reason to lie
Baby we don't have to deny
Whatever happens we can't say we didn't try 
Nothing for us to do now but say goodbye
Oh girl there ain't no tears to cry
I think its over, I think its over
We both know this love has died
I think its over, I think its over
Cause I just can't take it anymore?.. Cause I just can't take it anymore
(Repeat 2X)
