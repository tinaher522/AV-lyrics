<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Cocoa_Butta">
I know you like my style
You like how I put it down
You're so sure every time I'm around
I wanna see that body rock
Uuu tastes like caramel
That.. suits you very well
..Make me wanna rock
Chorus
Girl I would love to see you tonight
And then we go uuu tonight
Turn around and let's rhyme tonight
Me and you just how I like it
.. tonight and then we go uu tonight
Got me open uuu
Wanna feel on you
So soft and smooth
Cocoa butta baby
Got me open uuu
Wanna feel on you
So soft and smooth
Cocoa butta baby
I wanna touch it there
No not there but right there
Don't hesitate just say yeah
'Cause I know you like it
Tell me you like it
I can tell by the way you move
That you got some freaking view
Well I got something freaky in me too
So let's freak each other
Girl I would like to
Chorus
I know you like my style
You like how I put it down
You're so sure turn around
I wanna see that body rock
I know you like my style
You like how I put it down
You're so sure turn around
I wanna see that body rock
Got me open uuu
Wanna feel on you
So soft and smooth
Cocoa butta baby
Got me open uuu
Wanna feel on you
So soft and smooth
Cocoa butta baby (repeats)
