<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Used_To_You">
In my back pocket
But just in case
She is my comfort
A smile across my face (smile across my face)
Oh, and i'm so content
I didn't want it
But now its why i live
So what am i doing?
Who have u meet?
Shes on my shoulder
And im ok with that
Oh, i can't escape it
But its ok
Cuz truthfully I 
Don't want to anyways
I've grown accustom
To what you do
I guess you can say
I'm getting used to you (used to you)
I'm getting used to you (used to you)
Oh, I'm getting used to you
Instant access
To extacsy
My grown and sexy
And your maturity (maturity) 
I love it, when I take charge
At least not at first
But now i lick my 
I've grown accustom
To what you do (To what you do)
I guess you can say
I'm getting used to you (used to you)
I'm getting used to you (used to you)
Oh, I'm getting used to
Your walk, your talk
All that you do baby
I'm so used to you
Your walk, your talk
All that you do baby
I'm so used to you
So used to you, hey hey!
I've grown accustom
To what you do
I guess you can say
I'm getting used to you (used to you)
I'm getting used to you (used to you)
Oh, I'm getting used to you
I've grown accustom
To what you do
I guess you can say
I'm getting used to you (used to you)
I'm getting used to you (used to you)
Oh, I'm getting used to you
