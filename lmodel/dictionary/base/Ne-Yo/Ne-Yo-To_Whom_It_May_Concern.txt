<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="To_Whom_It_May_Concern">
Type a text to a girl I used to see
Tell her that I found someone with whom I
choose to be
Ah, might sound like this
To whom it may concern
If you got this message then you're somebody I know
Probably somebody I been
intimate with befo'
Or at least I have planned to be, sometime in the
future
This is not intended to be offensive at all
But to inform you that there is more than one of y'all
Quite a few actually,
more than I'm proud of
But to everyone of you (oooh)
This is me saying that I'm through (oooh)
I'm not trying to hurt anybody but (but)
Enough is enough ('nough)
There
can be no more us
Because of what I just found
(I found love) so I gotta go
(I found love) now I ain't playing no mo' (whoa)
And I apologize (whoa) but this is goodbye
(I found love, wasn't looking for it)
(I found love, but I can't ignore it, whoa)
And I apologize (whoa) but this is goodbye
And I know this is very unexpected
But so was the way that me and this girl connected
It was something magical, story worth status
(You know what I mean?)
And I must repeat that I'm not tryin' to offend
But there ain't no use in even tryin' to pretend
'Cause nobody else compares
None of you do, sorry it's true
But to each and everyone of you (ooh)
This is me saying that I'm through (ooh)
I'm not trying to hurt anybody but (but)
Enough is enough ('nough)
There can be no more us
Because of what I just found
(I found love) so I gotta go,
(I found love) now I ain't playing no mo' (whoa)
And I apologize (whoa) say but this is goodbye
(I found love, wasn't looking for it)
(I found love, but I can't ignore it, whoa)
EY And I apologize (whoa) say but this is goodbye EY
Ah, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, said I don't mean to hurt your feelings
But the love I'm feeling, is so real, I love this
So I guess it just is what it is, yeah, yeah
Hmm EY, said I don't mean to hurt your feelings
But the love I'm feeling, is so real, I love this
So I guess it just is what it is, yeah
(I found love) so I gotta go
(I found love) oeeh now I ain't playing no more, whoa
And I apologize (whoa) say but this is goodbye
(I found love, wasn't looking for it)
(I found love, but I can't ignore it whoa)
And I apologize (whoa) but this is goodbye
So sorry baby, sorry baby, but I gotta go
I gotta go, I really gotta go right now, yeah
Sorry baby, so sorry baby, but I gotta go
I gotta go, I really gotta go right now (really gotta go but)
She's callin on the other line
So let me send this text off and go on with my life
I hope you find somebody, special as what I found
