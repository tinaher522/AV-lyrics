<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Miss_Right">
Hello, good evening
Came in here to shut the world out
Nothing to get into, nothing to be about
Just grab a little bite, quiet little night
By no means looking for Miss Right
But hello, good evening
Clearly she was out with her girls alone (That, I could tell)
Beautiful with barely any make-up on (So natural)
The kind that make you wanna put the games away
Think about the future, but first I'll say
Hello, good evening
Oh, Miss Right
Miss Right, what are you doing here?
Oh, Miss Right
Wasn't expecting you tonight
Oh, Miss Right
Miss Right, how 'bout we disappear?
Said if you got no plans, baby, if you got time
Come and be the rest of my life
Oh, Miss Right
Well, ain't it amazing?
Spend forever looking, all the time wasting
Soon as I throw my hands up and say I quit
Turn the corner and there my future sits
Clearly she was out with her girls alone (That, I could tell)
Beautiful with barely any make-up on (So natural)
The kind that make you wanna put the games away
Think about the future, but first I'll say
Hello, good evening
Oh, Miss Right
Miss Right, what are you doing here?
Oh, Miss Right
Wasn't expecting you tonight
Oh, Miss Right
Miss Right, how 'bout we disappear?
Said if you got no plans, baby, if you got time
Come and be the rest of my life
Please forgive me if I'm forward
But this chance won't pass me by
'Cause see, I'm looking at forever
And it's the most beautiful thing I've seen in my life
Oh, Miss Right
Miss Right, what are you doing here?
Wasn't expecting you tonight
Miss Right, how 'bout we disappear?
Said if you got no plans, baby, if you got time
Come and be the rest of my life
Miss Right, what are you doing here?
Wasn't expecting you tonight
Miss Right, how 'bout we disappear?
Said if you got no plans, baby, if you got time
Come and be the rest of my life
Said if you got plans, baby, if you got time
Come and be the rest of my life
