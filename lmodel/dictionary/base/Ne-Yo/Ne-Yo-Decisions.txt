<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Decisions">
The angel says
Take a second, think about it
Ask yourself is it really worth it
Really worth it
Said u got a good girl on your side
And u kno that she don't deserve it
Don't deserve
But the devil says
Look at how shes lookin at u
U kno u wana get it crackin
Get it crackin
And plus how can your girl get hurt
If she don't even kno that it happened
That it happened
It's got me like oooh
Cus i wana do right
But she looks so good tonight
And its got me singin oooh
Cus i wana get it on
But i kno that its wrong
Decisions decisions (whooaaaa)
Said decisions decisions (whoaaaaa)
Said decisions decisions (whoooaaaa)
Decisions decisions (whoaaaa)
Decisions decisions
The angel says
What would you want her to do
If she was in the same situation
Situation
Said think of your relationship
And walk away ignoring temptation
Said temptation
But the devil says
She aint that kind of girl
So thats not even how it would go
She'd never put her self in that place
Said your a man so go ahead &amp; be a man
Just make sure she never knows
And everything will be okay
It's got me like oooh
Cus i wana do right
But she looks so good tonight
And its got me singin oooh
Cus i wana get it on
But i kno that its wrong
Decisions decisions (whooaaaa)
Said decisions decisions (whoaaaaa)
Said decisions decisions (whoooaaaa)
Decisions decisions (whoaaaa)
Decisions decisions
So what you gona do
Kno u gotta make a move
Are u gona do right
Or get down for the night
Kno u gotta choose
Said u kno u love your girl
And u kno she loves u too
But what u gotta ask your self
Is it worth losin her to u
It's got me like oooh
Cus i wana do right
But she looks so good tonight
And its got me singin oooh
Cus i wana get it on
But i kno that its wrong
Decisions decions (whooaaaa)
Said decisions decisions (whoaaaaa)
Said decisions decisions (whoooaaaa)
Decisions decisions (whoaaaa)
Decisions decisions
