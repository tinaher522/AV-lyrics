I Feel Good Lyrics
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Stepping out tonight with my people
Everybody's fly, whined me down my suit it gets attention
Whenever I walk by
They say ohh
He walks around like his the one important like he owns the world
Catching eyes of jealousy feud haters
Intriguing beautiful girl
I don't know what it is (ohh)
But it's got me gliding 
And i like it
I don't known what it is
But Im allright
And the best way to describe it
[chorus]
I feel good
Like the moon is shining just for me 
Tonight I'm flyest I can be
Dont you try to bring me down though
It's not like you could
I feel too damn good (x2)
Tipping out my hand with such swagger 
Ladies how are you
One of y'all need to be on my arm 
Well instead maybe two
And let's go 
Let me make you smile with my carizma
And lead you to the floor
Lets dance like we know no everybody's watching
Cuz that's what we're here for
[chorus]
I feel good
Like the moon is shining just for me 
Tonight I'm flyest I can be
Dont you try to bring me down though
It's not like you could
I feel too damn good (x2)
Back off of me
That negativity
Don't want to hear what you say
Im gon dance away my drama
So you best to get out of my way
[chorus 2x]
I feel good
Like the morning is shining just for me 
Tonight I'm flyest I can be
Dont you try to bring me down though
It's not like you could
I feel too damn good (x2)
