<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Real_Thing">
She said that she'd take it off 
Right here
Take it off 
Right now
Give him back his ring and stay with me
She must think thats what i want to hear
Good as it may sound
I know myself  that cant be
And i didnt feel bad about it till right then
Had to remind her that we were just pretend
I said baby i want you
But he needs you
Stay with the real thing
I never love you like him
See i only want you
But baby he needs you
Stay with the real thing
Stay with the real thing
Stay witchya man
Here comes a tear
Here comes a tear
Baby please dont cry
Dont cry
I thought u knew wat this was
Baby I never acn take the place
Of ur husband
But we'll always be friends
Baby we shouldnt have become lovers
And i didnt feel bad about it till right then
Had to remind her that we were just pretend
I said baby i want you
But he needs you
Stay with the real thing
Ill never love u like he does
See i only want you
Baby he needs you
Stay with the real thing
Stay with the real thing
Stay witchya man
Hes got love for you forever
Why cant you see here with me wont be better
Oh cus i only want you
But he needs you
Stay with the real thing
Ill never loved you like him
See i only want u baby
But he needs you
Stay with the real thing
Stay with the real thing
Stay witchya man
