<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Genuine_Only">
We may struggle 
We may even very well see hell's front gates 
Don't think that you or I 
Are above making mistakes 
Said I'm gonna get on your damn nerves 
And you gonna make me mad 
But I know we'll survive all that 
Cause love this good could never be that bad 
[Chorus] 
So may you never know the way 
Way that it feels 
Feels to be lonely 
May you never know one day 
When love isn't real 
See this stuff to me is genuine only 
See well maybe in a perfect world 
We would get along perfectly 
But seeing how this is real life 
Sometimes we just wanna be 
And I may make you say that you wanna leave 
Never come back 
But I know we'll survive all that 
Cause love this good could never be that bad 
[Chorus] 
Said I ain't always gonna like you girl 
Said you ain't always gonna like me girl 
But you're the only one I want in this world 
Let me sing it again
(I ain't always gonna like you girl)
Said I ain't always gonna like you girl
(And you ain't always gonna like me girl)
Said you ain't always gonna like me girl
(But I love you more than anything in this world) 
But I love you more than anything in this world 
May you never know the way 
The way that it feels 
Feels to be lonely 
May you never know one day 
When love isn't real 
See this stuff to me is genuine only
May you never know the way 
To the way that it feels 
Feels to be lonely 
May you never know one day 
When love isn't real 
See this stuff to me is genuine only
