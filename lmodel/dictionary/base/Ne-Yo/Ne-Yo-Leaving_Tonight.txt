[Featuring Jennifer Hudson]
[Ne-Yo talking:]
I believe that love and trust are one in the same
I don't think you can truly love somebody unless you trust them
That blind trust, that beyond a shadow of a doubt
No matter what this person sayin, that person
You believe your man
Now you say you love me, but every time one of your little friends come at you with something
We gotta do this
Mama I'm tryin, I'm trying to show you that I'm for real
Tell me what I gotta do to show you that I'm for you
[Jennifer Hudson talking:]
Just shut up and listen
[Verse 1 - Jennifer Hudson:]
Two hundred and sixteen
That's how many times that I went
Back and forth about it in my mind
Could she, could she really be
Who he's telling me that she is
There's something about it
That don't feel right
[Bridge 1 - Jennifer Hudson (Ne-Yo)]
Said today she called here 26 times
(I know you counted)
You kept telling me not to worry
(Don't worry bout it)
Wanna believe that you're telling the truth
(So don't doubt it)
But if you are lying to me
[Chorus 1 - Jennifer Hudson (Ne-Yo)]
You're leaving tonight
Out of my life
Everyone said you ain't no good
Then you prove them right
You're leaving tonight
It's over and done
Ain't no sense in trying to wait till the morning comes
(You're leaving tonight)
[Verse 2 - Ne-Yo]
Baby now hold up
Lets just settle down
Cuz there's a perfect explanation
To this situation
That we're goin through
(This thing that we're goin through)
I swear I don't know that girl
But I seen her 'round
And she's expressed how much she want it
But baby I'm not lonely
All of me is around you
[Bridge 2 - Ne-Yo (Jennifer Hudson)]
Said I got a girl like a thousand times
(So you counted)
She kept telling me not to worry
(Don't worry bout it)
Please believe I'm telling the truth
(I really doubt it)
Really wish you would believe in me
[Chorus 2 - Ne-Yo]
I'm not leaving tonight
Girl you're my life
All of your friends think I'm no good
Please don't prove them right
I'm not leaving tonight
Its over and done
Let's leave this alone, and lets make love
Till the morning come
(Not leaving tonight)
[Bridge 3 - Jennifer Hudson (Ne-Yo)]
Oh I won't deny
That everything in my body
Wants to know that you're the one
(So what's the problem girl?)
See I can't take this serious when you're just having fun
(No, I'm not just having fun)
Steady running around making a fool of me
(Baby girl you can't listen to everyone
I'm your man, trust in me
Don't let them interfere with us being happy)
[Breakdown - Jennifer Hudson (Ne-Yo)]
(Love me girl)
I love you, that's a fact
(Say that you love me baby)
But I'll be dammed if ima let you up and disrespect who's been there from the start
(You not gon disrespect my heart)
You claim to not know (not know that girl)
But her name and number is in your phone
She even got a ringtone
You care to explain that part?
[Bridge 1 - Jennifer Hudson (Ne-Yo)]
Said today she called here 26 times
(I know you counted)
You kept telling me not to worry
(Please don't worry bout it)
Wanna believe that you're telling the truth
(So don't doubt it)
But if you are lying to me
[Chorus 3 - Ne-Yo (Jennifer Hudson)]
I'm not leaving tonight
Girl you're my life
(Everyone said you ain't no good
And you prove them right)
I'm not leaving tonight
(It's over and done)
Just leave us alone
And lets make love
Till the morning come
Not leaving tonight
[Outro - Ne-Yo (Jennifer Hudson)]
Said I just need you to trust me
(I wanna trust you)
Not leaving tonight
