<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="All_I_Can_Be_Is_Me">
(ohhhh)
The car that I drive, may not impress
But I get where I need to go
You may disagree, with the way that I dress (oooh)
But I'm always comfortable
My fortune and fame,
Ain't no display (nooo), normally I stick to myself
And to be perfectly honest,
I like it that way 
So it doesn't matter what you say
This may not be who you want me to be
All I can be is me
I won't pretend,
So baby take it or leave
'Cause all I can be is me (all I can be, all I can be)
All I can be is me (all I can be, all I can be)
All I can be is me 
What you get is what you see
'Cause all I can be is me
(ohhh, yeah, yeah)
Sometimes I prefer to just stay at home
Don't need that fancy restaurant
Sometimes I would rather turn the tv on,
Simple is all I want
Why put on a mask?
Or be artificial?
There's never a reason
I'm happy with me,
My life's not an issue
I'm ok with who I'm bein'
Though I may not be who you want me to be
But all I can be is me
I won't pretend,
So baby take it or leave
'Cause all I can be is me (all I can be, all I can be)
All i can be is me (all I can be, all I can be)
Said all I can be is me
What you get is what you see
'Cause all I can be is me
(ooohh)
Money, cars, and diamond rings
All those expensive things
Baby I just don't give a damn
But if you really love me,
Like you say you love me
Then baby take me as I am
(heeeey)
Though I may not be who you want me to be
But all I can be is me.
I won't pretend,
So baby take it or leave. (hey)
'Cause all I can be is me (all I can be, all I can be)
All I can be is me. (all I can be, all I can be) 
Said all I can be is me. 
What you get is what you see
'Cause all I can be is me.
