<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="My_Mind">
Ooh ooh ooh, oooh
Ooh ooh ooh, oooh
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Ooh ooh ooh, oooh
Ooh ooh ooh, oooh
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Ooh ooh ooh, oooh
Yeah
He's looking right through me, yeah
As if he knows I've been thinking
Oh trying hard to hide it, yeah
Oh but everything he is, I like it
Gotta get you outta my head
It feels like he's reading my mind,
Coz he's doing everything that I like
And no matter how hard I try,
I can't seem to fight it
It feels like he's reading my mind
Ooh ooh ooh, oooh
He's reading my mind
Ooh ooh ooh
It feels like he's reading my mind
Hey, mm I'm sitting with no one else
Sitting all alone, we catch eyes,
And suddenly he comes over
And introduces himself, yes ooh
Everything that I want to hear, yeah
Mm, that exactly what he put in my ear
Gotta get you outta my head
It feels like he's reading my mind 
Hey, reading my mind
Coz he's doing everything that I like 
And no matter how hard I try (hey)
I can't seem to fight it (fight it)
It feels like he's reading my mind
Ooh ooh ooh, oooh
He's reading my mind
Ooh ooh ooh (hey)
It feels like he's reading my mind
Ooh, some kind of magic I can't explain 
My calm &amp; cool, I cannot maintain 
All that I know
Is that when he looks at me
It feels like he's reading my mind
It feels like he's reading my mind 
(Reading my mind)
Coz he's doing everything that I like 
And no matter how hard I try (ooh ooh)
I can't seem to fight it (hey)
It feels like he's reading my mind
Ooh ooh ooh, oooh
He's reading my mind
(reading my mind)
Ooh ooh ooh
It feels like he's reading my mind
Ooh ooh ooh, oooh
He's reading my mind
Ooh ooh ooh
It feels like he's reading my mind
