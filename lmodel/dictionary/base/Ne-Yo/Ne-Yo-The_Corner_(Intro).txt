<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="The_Corner_(Intro)">
Spoken:
Its your boy Ne-Yo
For the mix tape (This shit don't gotta be perfect)
Gonna do this like this (My imperfection is my perfection)
Verse:
In the black stretched 'Lac with the diamond in back
He in the back, cream suit, --?-- gators to match
A leather print feather in hit hat, sippin' on yac
He roll around living out scenes from the mac
He like his woman with lower ambition and common sense (So That)
He can convince them to make him dollars and cents (So that)
She look at him and see a savior, a prince (But in fact)
He's just a pimp with a limp and a strong grip on her
Come with his chips, don't slip or he'll flip on ya
Zip up that lip don't say shit just get corner
Pull up them pumps, the skirt, and get them jimmys out
Catch every thing that you can, cuz every penny counts
Don't come up short, run up with just any amount (Nah)
Like your little girlfriends, you'll be pourin a little Henny out (Ahh)
And hit the block in the sizzle and burn
This is your life, that's your daddy and tricks your turn
Chorus:
On the corner, you wish you could cease the pimpin
You wish you made better decisions
Stuck out on the corner skeezing, trickin just to make a living, living
On the corner, you wish you could cease the pimpin
You wish you made better decisions
Stuck out on the corner skeezing, trickin just to make a living, living, living
