Baby, baby
I think Chris might have said it best 
When he said the beautiful ones - they were true every time
She's the reason for all my stress
And yet she's the only one that can truly ease my mind
If I think that we could be alright
With the way the we just chill
How she touch me and how she kiss you
If you     her for her other guys
I can't stand to think that he's getting the same loving that I get
So tell me what is it going to be?
Make the decision
There's just one rule
Tell him that you want me
I know what I want
Girl I want you
What is it going to be?
I can't get enough
Make your mind up
Let me know what you want
Not complaining
Ok?
I am gonna be your man
But he's in the way
So I can't understand
If I think that we could be alright

With the way the we just chill
How she touch me and how she kiss me
If you     her for her other guys
I can't stand to think that he's getting the same loving that I get
So tell me what is it going to be?
Make the decision
There's just one rule
Tell him that you want me
I know what I want
Girl I want you
What is it going to be?
And it's hard to see you this happy
Because you just    
And that's so Unfair to me
Only if you could get rid of him we could be happy
Baby let me know
What's it going to be?
Make the decision
There's just one rule
Tell him that you want me
I know what I want
Girl I want you
What is it going to be?
Baby, baby, babyÂ…
