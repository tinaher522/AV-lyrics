<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Too_Little_Too_Late">
How many times did I ask 'why are you with him'?
How many times did I beg you to run away?
How many times did he tell you it won't happen again?
And how many times did it happen the very next day?
And now I'm asking why didn't you listen to me?
Why didn't I do something,
Though you said 'please just let it be'?
Why did I let him take you from me?
The choices we make, to right the mistakes.
Too little too late.
What did I say the very first time it happened?
I said where is he now and what do you want me do to?
Why did you tell me no, why were you protecting him?
When all I was trying to do, was protect you.
And now I'm asking why didn't you listen to me?
Why didn't I do something,
Though you said 'please just let it be'?
Why did I let him take you from me?
The choices we make, to right the mistakes.
Too little too late.
And I just can't help feeling,
Feeling like I let you down.
Your knight in shining armor,
Protecting you from harm.
Yeah right, if that were true,
You'd still be around!
Why didn't you listen to me?
Why didn't I do something,
Though you said 'please just let it be'?
Why did I let him take you from me?
The choices we make, to right the mistakes.
Too little too late.
Why didn't you listen to me?
Why didn't I do something,
Though you said 'please just let it be'?
Why did I let him take you from me?
The choices we make, to right the mistakes.
Too little too late.
Too little too late.
