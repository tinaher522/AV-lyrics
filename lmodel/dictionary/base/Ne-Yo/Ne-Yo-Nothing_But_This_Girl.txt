<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Nothing_But_This_Girl">
[Verse-1]
Take all my money from me
Nothing matters but the girl
Take the recognition
Take all the fame
Even take my name
Nothing matters but the girl
Take every stitch of clothes that I own
And completely naked I will walk to her
Take until you can't
Take me, as long as you don't touch my baby
Nothing matters but the girl
Said I don't even like to think
Think of being by myself
As long as your standing next to me
I don't need nothing else
Not nothing else, yes
[Chorus]
Nothing but the girl
Nothing matters but the girl
I tell you nothing matters but that girl
Said nothing but my baby
Nothing but the girl
Nothing matters but the girl
I tell you nothing matters but that girl
Nothing but my baby
Said nothing but my baby
[Verse-2]
Take my seconds, minutes, hours
All my precious time 'cause
Nothing matters but the girl
Take my skill away
The words I say
Reason in my rhyme 'cause
Nothing matters but the girl
Excuse me Lord
Don't mean to interrupt
But stop what your doing
Make 'em take the world
But if you could, oh, please just
Leave her here with me 'cause
Nothing matters but the girl
[Chorus]
Nothing but the girl
Nothing matters but the girl
I tell you nothing matters but that girl
Said nothing but my baby
Nothing but the girl
Nothing matters but the girl
I tell you nothing matters but that girl
Nothing but my baby
Said nothing but my baby
Tell you nothing but my baby
[Verse-3]
Ain't nothing on this whole wide world
That I can't do without
Except for you, no doubt
My girl
Said not even the air I breathe
Is more important to me
Than my baby, baby, baby
I tell you nothing but my baby
Said nothing but my baby
Nothing but the girl
[Chorus]
Nothing but the girl
Nothing matters but the girl
I tell you nothing matters but that girl
Said nothing but my baby
Nothing but the girl
Nothing matters but the girl
I tell you nothing matters but that girl
Nothing but my baby
Said nothing but my baby
[repeats]
