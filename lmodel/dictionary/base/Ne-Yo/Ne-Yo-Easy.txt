<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Easy">
Oooh hooOOooo ....yeah
I kept the flowers, the candy, the letter that you wrote to me
And I laughed a long time
As it all went up in smokes
It was funny
[bridge]
See I don't care
No I don't care
'Cause you don't care
So I don't care anymoreee
[chorus]
It was eaaaaaaa-sy
Easy to love me
But you didn't even want to try
So it was eeasssss-sy
Easy to leave you
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
I got all your messages on my phone
And the texts as well
I will be changing my number tomorrow
And my email
[bridge]
Because I don't care ( don't matter what you try to say )
No I don't care ( don't you realise it's too late )
'Cause you didn't care a thing , so why should I care now
See around
[chorus]
It was eaaaaaaa-sy
Easy to love me
But you didn't even want to try ( didn't even want to try )
So it was eeasssss-sy ( easy )
Easy to leave you ( leave you )
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Said i remember
How much i cried (mmm..)
Inside a part of me died
Oh..Unfortunately for you
It was the part of me that gave a damn about your lie
Shoulda been easy ...ooh..
Easy to love me .. oh...
Ohh! should've been easy
[chorus]
It was eaaaaaaa-sy
Easy to love me ( to love me )
But you didn't even want to try ( you didn't even want to try )
So it was eeasssss-sy ( easy )
Easy to leave you ( to leave you )
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Should've been easy
Should've been easy
Should've been easy
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Should've been easy
Should've been easy
Should've been easy
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye...
