<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="It_Never_Rains">
I was ashamed to show my sorrow
I didn't want anyone to see
My boyfriend she decided to borrow
And it felt like someone stabbin me
I was invisable till i got hurt
Every day was just another song
And the day that u dont want them too
Thats the day everybody ask u whats wrong
It never rains
It never rains
It never rains when you want it too
Can't hide my pain
Cus it won't rain
Here's my tears
Here's my tears out in plain view
Every cares when you don't give a damn
Nobody gives a damn when you care
Can't be alone when you want to
And when you need someone, nobodys there
This is the story of my own life
Ive got no choice but to let you kno
Cus even if i stood here and said nothing
The tears runnin down my face would tell you so
It never rains
It never rains
It never rains when you want it to
Cant hide my pain
Cus it wont rain
So heres my tears
Heres my tears out in plain view
I think you kno me
And i think that i'm you
I think you kno what i'm going through
It never rains
It never rains
It never rains when you want it to
Cant hide my pain
Cus it wont rains
So heres my tears
Heres my tears out in plain view
