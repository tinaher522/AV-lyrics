<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="I'm_Doing_Ok">
Comin outta my shell and i been doin alright
No more crowdin my days and no more hauntin my nights
(had me in a state of shock) couldn't believe it
She had me weezin, she was the air i was breathin (and it)
(had me in a state of shock) i caught her creepin
She was my reason for beein and she was cheatin
But i'm okay
Outta my sight, outta my mind, outta my head, outta my way
I'm doin okay, i said i'm doin okay
Girl i ain't trippin on you anymore
I said i'm doin okay
Outta my sight, outta my mind, outta my head, outta my way
I'm doin okay, i said i'm doin okay
Outta my sight, outta my mind, outta my head, outta my way
I'm doin okay
Can't believe all the drama that you put me through (tryna be theÂ ??? man)
I'm a player again, and that's all thanks to you
Thank you baby
(had me in a state of shock) couldn't believe it
She had me weezin, she was the air i was breathin (and it)
(had me in a state of shock) i caught her creepin
She was my reason for beein and she was cheatin
But i'm okay
Outta my sight, outta my mind, outta my head, outta my way
I'm doin okay, i said i'm doin okay
Girl i ain't trippin on you anymore
I said i'm doin okay
Said i wasted so much time (wasted so much time)
But that's okay baby, girl cuz i'm alright
I said i'm doin okay
Outta my sight, outta my mind, outta my head, outta my way
I'm doin okay, i said i'm doin okay
Girl i ain't trippin on you anymore
I said i'm doin okay
Outta my sight, outta my mind, outta my head, outta my way
I'm doin okay, i said i'm doin okay
Girl i ain't trippin on you anymore
I said i'm doin okay
Outta my sight, outta my mind, outta my head, outta my way
I'm doin okay, i said i'm doin okay
Girl i ain't trippin on you anymore
I said i'm doin okay
I'm doin, i'm doin alright (i said i'm doin okay)
I'm doin, i'm doin just fine
Girl i'm doin okay
