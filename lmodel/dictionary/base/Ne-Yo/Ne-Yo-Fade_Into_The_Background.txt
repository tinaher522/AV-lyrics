<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Fade_Into_The_Background">
She looks so good in that white dress 
At the far end of the aisle 
Standing where I should be standing 
Some other man on his face there's a smile 
I just walked in sat down silent 
I stood outside for awhile 
Wondering why did I come here 
Face it you messed up and now she's with somebody else 
And now all I can do is smile 
And fade into the background 
I'll say congratulations and I'll fade into the background 
Such a lovely reception 
I sit here sipping Ros√© 
Then we catch eyes for a second 
Both of us smile then quickly look away 
It's funny you don't know what you got 
Till you ain't got it no more 
Put down my glass grab the bottle 
I throw it back and I shout she with somebody else 
And now all I can do is smile 
And fade into the background 
I'll say congratulations and I'll fade into the background 
Fade right into the background 
She's with somebody else 
And now all I can do is smile 
And fade into the background 
I'll say congratulations and I'll fade into the background
