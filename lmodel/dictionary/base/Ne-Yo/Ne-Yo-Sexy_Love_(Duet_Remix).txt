<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Sexy_Love_(Duet_Remix)">
My sexy love... (so sexy...)
(Verse 1)
She makes the hairs on the back of my neck stand up(i do)
Just one touch
i still get butterflies everytime he pass by
I cant say why(Ohh ohhh ohhhh)
And I just can't think (of anything else I'd rather do)
Than to hear you sing (sing my name the way you do)
When we do our thing (when we do the things we do)
(ne-yo &amp; candace)
Babygirl/boy you make me say (Ohh ohhh ohhhh)
(Chorus)
(ne-yo &amp; candace)
Sexy love girl/boy the things you do
(Oh baby baby) Keep me sprung, keep running back to you(keep me runnin back to you)
Oh I love making love to you
Babygirl/boy you know you're my (sexy love...)
(candace)
he makes the hairs on the back of my neck stand up
just one touch(and they)
(ne-yo)
Still too much say that I'm simp and I'm sprung all of the above
I can't help she makes me say (Ohh ohhh ohhhh)
And I just can't think (of anything else I'd rather do)
Than to hear you sing (sing my name the way you do)
When we do our thing (when we do the things we do)
Oh, babygirl/boy you make me say (Ohh ohhh ohhhh)
(Chorus)
Sexy love girl the things you do
(Oh baby baby) Keep me sprung, keep running back to you(keep me running back to you)
Oh I love making love to you
Say babygirl you know you're my (sexy love...)
(Verse 3)
Oh baby what we do it makes the sun come up
Keep on lovin' 'til it goes back down
(candace)
boy i cant get enough of you my sexy love
(ne-yo &amp; candace)
and that is why im keeping you around
my sexy love
(Chorus 2x:)
Sexy love girl the things you do (things you do baby)
(Oh baby baby) Keep me sprung, keep running back to you (keep me runnin' back to you)
Oh I love (I love) making love to you
Say babygirl you know you're my (sexy love...)
(ne-yo &amp; candace)
She makes the hairs on the back of my neck stand up
Just one touch...
