<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Why_Couldn't_I">
[Verse 1:]
Girl I had this special moment that you was standing right in front of me, me.
And I had it all figured out with the right words to say.
Everything was perfect as it can be.
But then I realized, that I only thought it was just a dream and the second I looked at you I couldn't say a thing.
All of a sudden I had butterflies in my stomach I couldn't breathe.
[Chorus:]
Why, why couldn't I show what I feel inside my heart, why couldn't I tell her how much that she means to me, why does it have to be this way?
[Verse 2:]
There's not a single doubt that I know that your the right one for me.
Girl we go together like pants and kicks. It's getting hard to resist, gotta build my confidence. Girl your so fine that I can say it for days.
Words just can't explain how I feel about you, your melody is catching like a pefect full of view, and I can't get enough cause your vibe is the stuff and still I don't know what to say.
[Chorus:]
Why, why couldn't I show what I feel inside my heart, why couldn't I tell her how much that she means to me, why does it have to be this way?
Why, why do I sit and cry that she's not mine,
Why? why do I feel so down, when she's not around.
Why, does it have to be this way?
[Verse 3:]
(why) its time for me to stop being a coward and face this up right now.(cause your the one)
(why) I'm a give it all I got if it's for my life right now now now now
Girl with you is where I wanna be
[Chorus:]
Why, why couldn't I show what I feel inside my heart, why couldn't I tell her how much that she means to me, why does it have to be this way?
Why, why do I sit and cry that she's not mine,
Why? why do I feel so down, when she's not around.
Why, does it have to be this way?
