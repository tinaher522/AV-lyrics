<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="The_Plan">
Spoken:
How's everybody doing
Hope you're enjoying the truth, the way, the problem, thus far
This is your friendly host Ne-Yo
I'd like to entitle this master piece here, The Plan
For all my folks in the club
Ya'll know what it is
Rock with me
Verse 1:
Well can I be honest baby
(I don't know your name)
And if you never told me
Where I'm gonna lead is the same
I'm trynna (Get that, hit that)
Drop you off somewhere
And then (Get back)
To the club and do it all again
But lets not focus on the future
Did you come here with your friends
Please keep one of your keys
Cuz you coming with me
Sorry, If i'm bossing
You want down
But I like what I see
And I get what I like
And thats how its going down
Girl
Chorus:
You gon finish that drink (And)
I'm gon finish this drink (And)
We gon go and get in my ride (Okay and then)
You gon take your clothes off (And)
I'm gon take my clothes off (And)
We gon go somewhere and get right (Alright, hey)
Sounds like a plan to me little mama
Sounds like a plan to me, yeah
Sounds like a plan to me little mama
Sounds like a plan to me, yeah
Verse 2:
Well can you take me to the place where the grass is greener
Ladies roll with me because my whip is cleaner
On average, we come to my crib
Hot sex, we're having it
Slingin baby, frontin baby
Well, that could be having it
Can I get a witness
I like girls with thickness
Head game, insane
Stay up out of business
Shorty, just shake that thing to the sound
But I like what I see
And I get what I like
And that's how its going down (Oh)
Chorus:
You gon finish that drink (And)
I'm gon finish this drink (And)
We gon go and get in my ride (Hey hey, Okay and then)
You gon take your clothes off (And)
I'm gon take my clothes off (Oh Yeah)
We gon go somewhere and get right (Hey, hey)
Sounds like a plan to me little mama (oh)
Sounds like a plan to me, yeah (Said it sounds like a plan to me)
Sounds like a plan to me little mama (Oh yeah)
Sounds like a plan to me, yeah
