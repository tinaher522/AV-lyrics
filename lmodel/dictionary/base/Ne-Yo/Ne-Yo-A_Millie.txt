<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="A_Millie">
To whom it may concern, 
You might sell a million more than me, 
But you don't got a million more than me, 
Let's be real.
Ahahaha
Let's do this thing.
Jeah.
Now I don't normally do this, 
But ahh, let's get it.
A millionaire I am young money, 
But, be clear my money so grown, 
It got grey hair, 
Though this Ne-Yo thang to you, 
May look like a new career, 
I've been the man behind the pimp, 
For about 8, 9 years.
Cut my vein let it leak, 
On the sheet of the tablet, 
I ain't lyin, 
Man your girlfriend's favorite song is mine, 
If I sang it then I wrote it, 
Even if I didn't sing it, 
Write the lyrics, make a Milli, 
Let another artist bring it, 
R&amp;B to Pop, 
Even got them Hip-Hop records drop back like that, 
To make me better, 
Bust it baby, pussy poppin, 
Tell them mothers, 
Hahahahaha
Why they hate I'm in Japan, 
But a week makin Millis, 
In languages I don't speak, 
If the language's money man, 
I speak it rather fluent, 
Man, tango can get me about 30 times, 
What you get, 
Write it in 15 minutes, 
A milli stack up, 
I've been writin 9 years, 
Take your time and add up, 
I got hits on other people, 
Not to mention my own, 
There ain't many in my tax bracket, 
Man I'm so alone, 
Pack it up and send them home, 
Pin on my microphone, 
By the time they reach my level, 
Man I'm already gone, 
Come on, 
At anyone in general this is not been it, 
You claiming millis, 
You ain't go this red dot is on your forehead, 
My middle name is more bread, 
And my last name is... than your bread, 
Get it?
Whether I sing it or spit it, I deliver, 
Restin comfortably on 8 figures, 
Get the picture, 
You do not pick a street fight with Floyd Mayweather, 
You don't do it, 
Tango, they talkin money, 
Are they talkin money?
Compound is in the building, 
Yo J B, 
I just got another irreplaceable check, 
And about to get that G5, 
Ya'll want me to pick ya'll up something up there?
Tango come with me, 
I get a discount if I get more than one.
Hahahahahaha! 
AHH Stop it!
