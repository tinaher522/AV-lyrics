<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Tonight">
(It seems like every day is something else
Another reason to be stressing)
And you just wanna run away
Said you just wanna run away
(You try to get out and enjoy yourself
But everybody's acting so depressing)
And you just wanna run away
Said you just wanna run away
(We about to hop up on this rocket
Get up outta here)
Go somewhere where nothing never goes wrong
'Bout to hop up on this rocket
Take to the sky, everything is fly
[Chorus]
'Cause we ain't even on earth tonight
We on a planet where the dudes got money and they're not afraid to spend it
(Hey!) Ayo ayo
And everything is alright
Ayo ayo
'Cause we ain't even on earth tonight
We on a planet where there ain't no drama and the party's never ending
(Hey!) Ayo ayo
And everything is alright
Ayo ayo
It seems like every day is something else
Another reason to be stressing
(And you just wanna run away
Said you just wanna run away)
You try to get out and enjoy yourself
But everybody's acting so depressing
(And you just wanna run away
Said you just wanna run away)
(We 'bout to hop up on this rocket
Get up outta here)
Go somewhere where nothing ever goes wrong
'Bout to hop up on this rocket
Take to the sky, everything is fly
[Chorus]
'Cause we ain't even on earth tonight (Baby baby)
No
'Cause we ain't even on earth tonight, oh
(And you'll be dancing through the moon and stars)
Got my girls from Venus, grab your boys from Mars
And we'll get away, go somewhere and just get wild
[Chorus]
