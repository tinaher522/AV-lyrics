He picked me up in an 064
I've never road in one of those before
His showed me things that I've never seen
All of my friends think his bad news
Before me sure he'd been with a few
But now I miss riding on the queen (ohohoh)
And everybody says his too mature
Too much for me
But I've never ever felt like this before
No I can't ignore
That I'm scared but not scared of living
I don't dare, I won't deny this love
I'll decide whats best for me
I'm not out of my league
So scared but ill never give in
I don't care what they may say about us
Don't tell me im out of my league
Im not out of my league
Never ending days and nights
When I'm with him, I feel so alive
Every moment feels like a dream (oohohwohoo)
And every one says his too mature
Too much for me
But I've never ever felt like this before
But I can't ignore
That I'm scared but not scared of living
I don't dare, I won't deny this love
I'll decide whats best for me
I'm not out of my league
So scared but ill never give in
I don't care what they may say about us
Don't tell me im out of my league
Im not out of my league
How do I refuse to love someone?
All over the years that I was born
When it comes to matters of the heart
Tell me what does it mean? What does it mean? (ohohoh)
(not scared of living, not scared of living, not scared of living)
That I'm scared but not scared of living
I don't dare, I won't deny this love
I'll decide whats best for me
I'm not out of my league
So scared but ill never give in
I don't care what they may say about us
Don't tell me im out of my league
Im not out of my league
Im not out im not out of my league
Im not out im not out of my league
Im not out im not out of my league
Im not out of my league
