<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Try_Me_Out">
See you need another lover
I can be the hole in your head; 
Shot down a couple times out tha love sky,  
Now you'd rather be alone instead, 
And i get it,Â ???
I'm a man with a number of flaws, I won't lie but that don't mean pass me by
[bridge]
I don't want to play like I know what you've been through, 'Cause I don't
I don't want to make you think I'll waste your time too, 'Cause I won't. 
I don't want you to look at me like these are the dudes, because I'm not.
Disappoint you girl, I wont do it; all I'm asking is a chance to prove it.
[chorus] 
Try me out, baby give me a shot; what you think I am, let me show you I'm not
Maybe we'll be a little, maybe we'll be a lot; maybe I'm what you're missing, maybe I'm not 
[x3]
I'm a man on a mission, 
Wanna be the kind of man you missin', 
The kinda man that pays attention when you talk 
'Cause I get it, someone stepped on your heart before, Somebody made you cry, 
I'm a man with a number of flaws, I won't lie, 
But that don't mean pass me by
[bridge]
I don't want to play like I know what you've been through, 'Cause I don't
I don't want to make you think I'll waste your time too, 'Cause I won't. 
I don't want you to look at me like these are the dudes, because I'm not.
Disappoint you girl, I wont do it; 
All I'm asking is a chance to prove it.
[chorus] 
Try me out, baby give me a shot; what you think I am, let me show you I'm not
Maybe we'll be a little, maybe we'll be a lot; maybe I'm what you're missing, maybe I'm not 
Try me out
Try me out
Try me out
Try me out
Try me out
