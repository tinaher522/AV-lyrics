<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Let_Go">
I know we're past tense
It's been a minute since
We were a couple and
Walking and holding hands
Kisses and I love you's
Doing what lovers do, baby
But baby, that was then
'Cause now we don't
Talk no more
You got a new man, and
It shouldn't bother me
But girl, it's driving me crazy
And everybody says
"Boy, why don't you just leave it alone?"
But I don't think I can
I sit up all night thinkin' 'bout ya, and
I know it aint right, baby, but I don't 
I don't think that I
Don't think I can let go
I sit up all night thinkin' 'bout ya, and
I know it aint right, baby, but I don't 
I don't think that I
Can let go
I'm holding on to hope
I know it's foolish though
Thinking that someday she might come back
Wish on it all the time
Knowin' it may never happen
But see, I'm not a fool
'Cause no we don't
Talk no more
You gotta new man, but
I'm gonna keep the faith 
I've got the patience
That some lack
But everybody says
"Boy, why don't you just leave it alone?"
But I don't think I can
I sit up all night thinkin' 'bout ya, and
I know it aint right, baby, but I don't 
I don't think that I
Don't think I can let go
I sit up all night thinkin' 'bout ya, and
I know it aint right, baby, but I don't 
I don't think that I
Can let go
I don't think I can let you go
(I can't let you go)
Oh, no
I don't think that I can let go
And everybody says...
And I don't think I can!
I sit up all night thinkin' 'bout ya, and
I know it aint right, baby, but I don't 
I don't think that I
Don't think I can let go
I sit up all night thinkin' 'bout ya, and
I know it aint right, baby, but I don't 
I don't think that I
Can let go
Said I don't think that I can let you
Said I don't think that I can let you
I don't think
I don't think I can let go
Said I'ma say it again
I don't think that I can let you
Said I don't think that I can let you
I don't think...
