<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="I_Come_First">
Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey 
(Verse 1)
I don't share
I'm not that type
Girl if that's you
Then walk on by
One of many 
Mot worth my while
But one and only
Now that's my style
(Hook)
Yeahhhhhhhh
If you feel how I feel 
Then sing it
Yeahhhhhhhh
Look him in the eye and tell him
(Chorus)
I come first wont come second 
I come first wont come second 
I come first wont come second
I come first or I don't come at all
(Verse 2)
I'm a price less find 
I'm supposed to be on a pedestal
Not standing in line
Oh no no no
So make a choice 
You must decide
It's them tonight
Or me for life
(Hook)
Yeahhhhhhhh
If you feel how I feel 
Then sing it
Yeahhhhhhhh
Look him in the eye and tell him
(Chorus)
I come first wont come second 
I come first wont come second 
I come first wont come second
I come first or I don't come at all
(Bridge)
Hey hey hey hey hey hey 
Hey hey hey hey hey hey 
Hey hey hey hey hey 
Lala lala lala lala ohhhh
Lala lala lala lala ohhhh
Lala lala lala lala ohhhh
Lala lala lala lala ohhhh
(Hook)                           
Yeahhhhhhhh
If you feel how I feel then sing
Yeahhhhhhhh
Look him in the eye and tell him
(Chorus x2)
I come first wont come second 
I come first wont come second 
I come first wont come second
I come first or I don't come at all
I come first wont come second 
I come first wont come second 
I come first wont come second
I come first or I don't come at all
Lala lala lala lala ohhhh
Lala lala lala lala ohhhh
Lala lala lala lala ohhhh
Lala lala lala lala ohhhh
Or I don't come at all
