[Chorus]
I said excuse me little mama if I may,
Take this thought, and send it your way
And if you don't like that, then send it right back
But I just gotta say
I wanna be on you (on you)
I wanna be on you (on you)
And if you don't like that, then send it right back
But I just gotta say, I just gotta say
Hey hey hey hey sh sh shawty with no limits that's what I need all the time
I'm with with with with it she with it she not sure she put it down
Come get get get get it the business
I hit hit it whose is it
The benz if the windows tinted go on lock it dirty south
Shawty, lock them grown me, n goose, patron, gin let let me go on in
Sexy morning ca catch me drawers in
Na na no not never ever witness lil mama
I said ya got me (ot me) call me pappy honest I keep buyers fellas
B-b-b-bypass shawty house pet got-got that proud cat
Home I'm poppin that ecstasy, pretty face and all that
Wh-what I look for this girl is hard core
The baddest outdoors deserve an encore
The definition of a show
[Chorus]
Hey I'm feelin you girl wanna get close to you no doubt
My s-s-swagger should tell it more than anything can vouch
Lil mama you are what's happenin' ghetto fine I'll make you proud
So stunnalicious I love it let's at least work something out
Miss thang, million dollar gang, coke bottle frame,
Make my wall of fame, let me know your name, I control the rain
I can make it better, matter fact I make it wetter,
Stormy weather with this cheddar all because you hot as ever
If you may, lately, let me play baby; make my way baby
You don't like it send me back it is okay baby
You's a keeper, such a diva, give me a fever,
If I could freak ya, give me the word I mean no harm
[Chorus]
Girl let me touch you like nobody can
Girl let me show you I'm a gentleman
I wanna be the one to hold your hand
I just wanna be, I just wanna be
Girl let me touch you like nobody can
I wanna show you I'm a gentleman
I wanna be the one to hold your hand
I just wanna be, I just wanna be
[Chorus: x2]
Be on you you you you
