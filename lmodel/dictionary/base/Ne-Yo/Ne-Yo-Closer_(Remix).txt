Closer [x4]
Woo
[Verse 1:]
Turn the lights off in this place
And she shines just like a star
And I swear I know her face
I just don't know who you are
Turn the music up in here
I still hear her loud and clear
Like she's right there in my ear
Telling me that she wants to
Own me
To control me
Come closer (come closer)
Come closer
[Chorus:]
And I just can't pull myself away
Under a spell I can't break
I just can't stop (I just can't stop)
I just can't stop (I just can't stop)
And I just can't free myself, no way
But I don't want to escape
I just can't stop (I just can't stop)
I just can't stop (I just can't stop)
I just can't stop
[Verse 2:]
I can feel her on my skin
I can taste her on my tongue
She's the sweetest taste of sin
The more I get, the more I want
She wants to own me
Come closer (closer)
She says, "Come closer"
Hey
[Chorus:]
And I just can't pull myself away
Under a spell I can't break
I just can't stop (I just can't stop)
I just can't stop (I just can't stop)
And I just can't free myself, no way
But I don't want to escape
I just can't stop (I just can't stop)
I just can't stop (I just can't stop)
I just can't stop
[Bridge:]
Come closer (closer) [x3]
Come closer
Ooo
I just can't stop, no-o
I just can't stop, no-o
(Just can't stop it, no, no)
I just can't stop, no-o
(Just can't stop it, no, no, no)
I just can't stop, no-o
(No, no)
[Chorus:]
And I just can't pull myself away
Under a spell I can't break
I just can't stop (I just can't stop)
I just can't stop (I just can't stop)
And I just can't free myself, no way
But I don't want to escape
I just can't stop (I just can't stop)
I just can't stop (I just can't stop)
I just can't stop
And I just can't pull myself away
Under a spell I can't break
I just can't stop (I just can't stop)
I just can't stop (I just can't stop)
I just can't stop
Come closer
