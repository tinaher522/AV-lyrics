<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Stuck_In_The_Middle">
Verse 1:
I'm not an idiot, though I may get some things wrong.
I'm not stupid, I'm figuring it out as I go along.
Sometimes my mind and heart disagree.
And I don't always know who to follow, so where does that leave me?
Chorus:
I'm stuck in the middle
Of this small space with just enough room for mistake.
I never said I knew what I was doing.
I'm stuck in the middle
Of wrong and right with no one to be my guiding light.
I never said I knew what I was doing.
Verse 2:
Crucifixion. Is that the way to go?
Is that the road I should be on?
Or is it forgiveness?
I'm damned if I do damned if I don't.
My mind says let go, my heart says hold on.
What the hell do you do when both feel right but both feel wrong?
Chorus:
I'm stuck in the middle
Of this small space with just enough room for mistake.
I never said I knew what I was doing.
I'm stuck in the middle
Of wrong and right with no one to be my guiding light.
I never said I knew what I was doing.
Ooo, Ooo, Ooo, Ooo, Ooo...
Bridge:
Everybody knows what I should have done,
Everyone's got all the answers,
But the one I need to be alright with,
Who I see in the mirror.
(Woahhhh) Ooo, Ooo, Ooo (Woahhhh) Ooo, Ooo, Ooo (Woahhhh)
Hey!
Chorus: (x2)
I'm stuck in the middle
Of this small space with just enough room for mistake.
I never said I knew what I was doing.
I'm stuck in the middle
Of wrong and right with no one to be my guiding light.
I never said I knew what I was doing.
