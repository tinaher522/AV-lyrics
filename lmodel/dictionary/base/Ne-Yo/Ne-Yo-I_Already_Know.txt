<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="I_Already_Know">
I was in the studio
Doing what I do, when 
She crept. And ever so gently
Walked over and just looked at me
"Is there a problem?," I said
She just stood staring at my eyes
Wondering, why no reply
Suddenly she begins to cry
(Baby we need to talk)
Then she begins, asking me about the weekend
She went out the town with three friends
Just her and the girls
(Do you remember?)
And she says
"Baby, I haven't been very honest lately"
And I don't want you to hate me
But baby, I got a confess right now (She said)
Told you I was out with my friends (But)
I was really with another man (Oh)
Just sat there smiling like (So) 
Baby won't you tell me something that I don't already know
Said, baby I'm not a fool (And)
I'd been known about you
Wanna come clean now, I don't think so
Baby won't you tell me something that I don't already know
She looked a bit shocked and
Suddenly her tears just stopped
As I start to breaking down her plot
Telling her things she tought I did not know (know)
Told her two of the chicks she was suppose to be with
All out of town, hanging out and shhh...
Came here looking for you, said they haven't seen you in a week or two.
So I put two and two together, 
And figured out you have a special friend
Next thing on my mind was revenge (Soo)
So me and your two friends, the time we had was great
If you don't believe me, then watch the tape
I put it with the rest of your stuff
Along with the ticket for the Greyhound bus
What did you think was gonna happen when you said
Told you I was out with my friends (But)
I was really with another man
I just sat there smiling like (So)
Baby won't you tell me something that I don't already know
Said, baby I'm not a fool (And) 
I've been known about you (yeah)
Wanna come clean now, I don't think so
Baby wont you tell me something that I don't already know
So then I said, forgive me
For letting you be me
Then I was na√Øve.. I'm sorry
Now if you can give me, that extra side door key
'Cause you wont need them anymore
'Cause you was out the door before 
She said..
Told you I was out with my friends (But)
I was really with another man (Oh)
I just sat there smiling like (So)
Baby won't you tell me something that I don't already know
Said, baby I'm not a fool (And) 
I've been known about you
Wanna come clean now, I don't think so
Baby wont you tell me something that I don't already know
Told you I was out with my friends (But)
I was really with another man (Oh)
I just sat there smiling like (So)
Baby won't you tell me something that I don't already know
Said, Baby I'm not a fool (And) 
I've been known about you
Wanna come clean now, I don't think so
Baby wont you tell me something that I don't already know
Tell me something that I don't already know.
