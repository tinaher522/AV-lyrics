<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Stress_Reliever">
I could be tired, she wake me up with it
I could be busy, I make time to go get it
We could be beating, that’s when she start to flirt
Looking at me, talking bout, daddy bring me my desert
She know what she doing
She know what that does
Every time she do it
Set it off, no matter what, oh, oh
She know what she doing
She know what I love
Every time she do it
Set it off, no matter what, oh, oh
She set it off no matter what
She tell me things like,
Things like I’m her favorite flavor
And there’s not a lollipop, that could ever compare ya
Uh, stress reliever, service to her king
She say daddy feed me,
And I know just what she means, uh, whoa
She know what she doing
She know what that does (she know what that does yea)
Every time she do it (uh every time she do it)
Set it off, no matter what (uh set it off babe, uh set it off babe)
She know what she doing (she know what she doing)
She know what I love (uh she know what I love)
Every time she do it
Set it off, no matter what, oh, oh (set it off babe, set it off babe)
She set it off no matter what
Set it off babe, set it off babe (do it, do it , do it)
Set it off babe, set it off babe (baby look up at me as you)
Set it off babe, set it off babe (do it, do it , do it)
Set it off babe, set it off babe(yea, yea)
Set it off babe, set it off babe (do it, do it , do it)
Set it off babe, set it off babe (baby look up at me as you)
Set it off babe, set it off babe (do it, do it , do it)
Set it off babe, set it off babe
She know what she doing (Set it off babe, set it off babe)
She know what that does (Set it off babe, set it off babe)
Every time she do it (Set it off babe, set it off babe)
Set it off, no matter what (Set it off babe, set it off babe)
She know what she doing (Set it off babe, set it off babe)
She know what I love (Set it off babe, set it off babe)
Every time she do it (Set it off babe, set it off babe)
Set it off, no matter what, oh, oh (Set it off babe, set it off babe)
