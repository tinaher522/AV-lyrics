<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="When_He_Kissed_Me">
Time stood still the other dayÂ 
Just stopped cuz of the wayÂ 
That he kissed meÂ 
The day shared the sky with the nightÂ 
Both Sunshine and MoonlightÂ 
Cause he kissed meÂ 
And the waters all sit still in the oceanÂ 
And the birds that fly above just froze in the air
Froze in the airÂ 
(Chorus)Â 
When he kissed me (x2)Â 
I closed my eyes and died a littleÂ 
Opened them and cried a littleÂ 
When he kissed me (x2)Â 
It was everything I thought that it would beÂ 
When he kissed meÂ 
She said through the tears that she criedÂ 
That she knew how I felt insideÂ 
When he kissed meÂ 
And I saw pain behind her eyesÂ 
Just couldn't figure whyÂ 
It was a mysteryÂ 
She said, "I bet the waters all sit still in the oceanÂ 
And all the birds just frozeÂ 
Is that how it goes?"Â 
(So I asked her)Â 
"How do you know?"Â 
She saidÂ 
"Cuz he kissed me
Yes, he kissed me"
She said she closed her eyes and died a little
Opened them and cried a little
When he kissed me
When he kissed me
She said it was everything she thought that it would be, mmm
(Original chorus 1x)
