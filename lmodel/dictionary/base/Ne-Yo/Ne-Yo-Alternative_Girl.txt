<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Alternative_Girl">
She ain't your typical,
She like the hip hop with the rock and roll,
Her favorites Uncle Biggie, Coldplay andÂ ?Yo,
She's very different but she's beautiful.
And I wanna know,
Nothing ordinary,
Everything is fly,
So sexy and unique,
And she's caught my eye.
An ooh, alternative girl, 
You got me digging what you do,
So can I kick it witchu?
Ooh, alternative girl,
Really 
Alternative girl.
She's versatile as hell,
106 &amp; Park but also TRL,
She's into skateboarders, ball players as well,
Don't know what she is but she's something else.
Nothing ordinary,
Everything is fly,
So sexy and unique,
And she's caught my eye.
Ooh, alternative girl, 
You got me digging what you do,
So can I kick it witchu?
Ooh, alternative girl,
Really want nothing to do but you,
Alternative girl.
Oooh, show us something new,
Alternative girl.
Alternative girl, 
You got me digging what you do,
So can I kick it witchu?
Ooh, alternative girl,
Really want nothing to do but you,
Alternative girl.
