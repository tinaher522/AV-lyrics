<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Nobody">
verse 1: 
she hit the floor and make the club ignite. she likes a sexy little fire. 
she keep on begging for more if you play it right, she can fulfill your every desire. 
chorus: 
so super natural appeal 
a crazy style and sex appeal 
hey pretty mama what's the deal would you be mine. 
Hey you got what i like.
 
nobody strut like her, can't nobody touch, (nobody nobody nobody)
nobody cut like her, nobody touch her (nobody nobody nobody) 
verse 2: 
she got the music pumping through her vains 
the way she do it makes you wanna (get up and touch that body oh) 
i like to sit and watch her do hea thang 
but in a minute imma join her. 
chorus: 
so super natural appeal 
a crazy style and sex appeal 
hey pretty mama what's the deal would you be mine. 
Hey you got what i like. 
nobody strut like her, can't nobody touch her (nobody nobody nobody)
nobody cut like her, nobody touch her (nobody nobody nobody) repeat 3x
