<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Irreplaceable_(Male_Version)">
This is from a man's point of view...
Fellas, sometimes we gotta tell them ladies
To the right, to the right (Huh, get, get to steppin')
To the right, to the right(Woahh ayy yeah)
To the right, to the right
That's where I'm goin' in the middle of the night
In the closet, that's your stuff
But trick, I bought it, so bitch don't touch (don't touch)
You talk a lot of bullshit, alright
But while you walk 'n talk imma get mine now
It's my name that's on your last
You bald-headed rat tryna get rid of that
[Hook:]
Back up out my face broad
I'm really tryna not talk to you
Talkin' bout I'm neva gonna find a girl like you
You must got me fucked up
[Chorus:]
You must not know 'bout me
You must think I'm playing
Cause I can have another you in an hour
Matter of fact, she's upstairs in tha shower, baby
You must now know 'bout me
You must think I'm playing
I can find another you on the corner
So don't you ever for a second get to thinkin' you're irreplaceable
[Verse 2:]
Trick, give me my phone so I can call my chick and see if she's home, yeah
(Oh shit I) Oh shit I forgot she's already home
What did you think I was putting you out for?
Cause you was unreal
Kinda like the horse that was sittin' on the back of your head
Baby fix them teeth
Seeing your face is so old to me
[Hook:]
Back out out my face broad
I'm really not tryna talk to you
Tellin' me I'm neva finding a girl like you
Well ya got me so damn twisted
[Chrous:]
You must not know 'bout me
You must think I'm playing
'cause I can have another you in a minute
Matter of fact, she'll drive up in a minute, baby
You must not know 'bout me
You must think I'm playing
I can have another you in an hour
So don't you ever for a second get to thinkin, you're irreplaceable (irreplaceable)
[Bridge:]
So since I'm not your everything
I'm not giving you anything
Nothing at all to you
Baby, I'm not giving you nothing, no wayyy
Go ahead and shed your tears
Cause the truth of the matter is
Replacing you was done last year
To the right, to the right
To the right, to the right (you gotta go, go to the right right oh yeah)
To the right, to the right (oh yeah ohh woahhh)
To the right, to the right
Don't you ever for a second get to thinkin' (What?!)
Get to thinkin' (What?!)
Get to thinkin' you're irreplaceable!!
You must not know 'bout me
You must think I'm playing
You must not know that I can have another you in a minute
Matter of fact, she'll be here in a minute, baby
You must not know about me (baby)
You must think I'm playing
I can have another you in an hour
Matter of fact, she's upstairs in the shower ohhh
You must not know 'bout me
You must think I'm playing
I can find another you, baby
There's so many of you baby
Gold diggin'(You must not know 'bout me)
Two timin' (You must think I'm playing)
Back stabbin'
Foreva Lyin'
Always needing , I need somethin'
You Ho
But the truth is
You have always been replaceable (Ooh)
Please see yourself out this way
