<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Don't_Gotta_Know">
She got a lot of nerve
Can't be around me for ten seconds
She gotta flirt
And though i think that'd make u crazy
Absurd
I got a girl
And she do it right in front of her
And my girl don't say a word
Its got me thinkin somethin
Its got me drinkin somethin
Im tryna work
Im in the studio thinkin somethin
And then she shows up
Jean shorts
Rolled up
Huggin that thing like mann
About to go nuts
I cant take
I, i cant take it
I, i cant take it
She beggin me to take it
And i want to
More than a crime its a felony
Girl friends best friend
And she keep on tellin me
She don't gotta kno
Shes sayin she don't gotta kno
I cant do it
I really wana do it
This girl has got me bout to lose control
Shes tellin me
She don't gotta kno
Shes sayin she don't gotta kno
I cant do it
I really wana do it
But see i got too much to lose so, no no no
I tell my lady
She laughin lookin at me
As if im crazy
She calls her up like
Girl u wont believe what this fool just said
Laughin as im sittin there
Holdin my head
She done denied it
So u kno what i get it
My girl thinkin im the one who tried it
Now what a sticky situation this turns into
She tryna get it
But im the one whos gettin accused
I cant take
I, i cant take it
I, i cant take it
She beggin me to take it
And i want to
And since my girl got me already
Guilty of a sin 
To myself I'm thinkin
She don't gotta kno
Im thinkin she don't gotta kno
I cant do it
But i really wana do it
This girl has got me bout to lose control
She got me thinkin
She don't gotta kno
I'm thinkin she don't gotta kno
I cant do it
But i really wana do it
Or do i got too much to lose i don't know no no
