<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Mirror">
[Verse 1:]
I must be honest with you babe (just 
Gotta be honest)
I love to watch the faces that you make (when we make love oh girl)
But when im behind you holding your hips and you close your eyes and bite your lips
I can't see you so might i suggest a change
Now mama please dont take me strange for what im about to say 
(please dont take me strange)
If you know anything bout me by now 
Im a freak just follow my lead
[Chorus:]
Baby i love making love infront of a mirror (infront of a mirror)
So that that i can watch you enjoying me (baby tonite)
Baby tonight lets try infront of a mirror (infront of a mirror)
Watching ourselves make love 
Girl why dont we
[Verse 2:]
And ima keep your chin up please watch me do the...nasty
I like it when you make your moves fast 
Mami if i pull your head back 
Cuz i want you to see that we look so good together
I understand that your not ready for me and my directory
Your daybut featuring me starring you
Baby thats okay with me 
Im the systems next best thing
[Chorus:]
Baby i love making love infront of a mirror (infront of a mirror)
So that that i can watch you enjoying me (baby tonite)
Baby tonite lets try infront of a mirror (infront of a mirror)
Watching ourselves make love girl why dont we
I see you can you see me watching you loving it [8x]
[Chorus:]
Baby i love making love infront of a mirror (infront of a mirror)
So that that i can watch you enjoying me (baby tonite)
Baby tonite lets try infront of a mirror (infront of a mirror)
Watching ourselves make love 
girl why dont we
[Fading:]
Can we make love infront of a mirror
