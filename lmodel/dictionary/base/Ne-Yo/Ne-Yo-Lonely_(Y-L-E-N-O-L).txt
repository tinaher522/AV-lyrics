<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Lonely_(Y-L-E-N-O-L)">
Verse 1:
42nd street, 4am
I'm rolling slowly
No destination in mind
Driver looking at me strange cuz I got in
Handed him a wad of cash
Sat back and told him just drive
I'm thinkin bout the day
you packed your things and left
Sayin you knew all about Chanel, Tiffany, Tracy, Stephanie
You went away,
so I'm writing in the fog upon the window to express myself
and how I'm feelin
Chorus:
Y, L, E, N, O, L
As I rode past you in this taxi cab
If you care at all, that means I'm lonely
Y, L, E, N, O, L
As I rode past you in this taxi cab
If you care at all
That means I'm lonely
Verse 2:
I see a woman walking with her man (man), man with his woman
Smiling as they stroll into this little bar (Bar)
As they kiss each other holding hands
I get sick to my stomach
So jealous of how f*ing happy they are, lucky N*ggas
There's a couple different people I could call right now
But the one I'm wanting don't want me at all right now
And that hurts through my heart, my mind, and my soul (soul)
Rolling in this cab writing on the window
Singing Y
Chorus:
Y, L, E, N, O, L
As I rode past you in this taxi cab
If you care at all, that means I'm lonely (Ohh)
Y, L, E, N, O, L
As I rode past you in this taxi cab
If you care at all
That means I'm lonely
Bridge:
What am I supposed to do now
Rolling round, feeling like a fool now
Cryin like a b--- in the back of this taxi cab
So used to it
Driver tries to ask if I'm alright
I say "Never mind, mind your business and just drive dammit
You don't know nothing about how I feel right now, let me spell it out"
Chorus:
Y, L, E, N, O, L (O, L)
As I rode past you in this taxi cab (Past you in this taxi cab)
If you care at all, that means I'm lonely
(Means I'm lonely, means I'm lonely baby) (Ohh)
Y, L, E, N, O, L (O, L)
As I rode past you in this taxi cab
If you care at all (If you even give a damn baby)
That means I'm lonely (That means I'm lonely, it means I'm lonely, oh)
Y, L, E, N, O, L (What it means baby)
As I rode past you in this taxi cab (Said I'm sorry that I did you wrong)
If you care at all, that means I'm lonely
(And I'm lonely without you, I miss you baby) (Ohh)
Y, L, E, N, O, L (L)
As I rode past you in this taxi cab (Taxi cab)
If you care at all, that means I'm lonely
(That means I'm lonely baby, lonely baby, oh oh oh)
