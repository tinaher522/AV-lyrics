<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Call_Me_No_More">
Oh oh oh oh oh oh ohoh mmm
Oh oh oh oh oh oh ohoh mmm
So many ways to say it,
I can think of a few.
See, I could be cold about,
Or just play it cool yeayeah.
I could just string you along,
Tellin' lies &amp; hidin' the truth. Ohohyeah.
See, but if I went that route,
That would make me no better than you.
Here's what I'm gona do..
Don't call here no more
We have nothing else to discuss
Baby do what you must
But don't call here no more
Boy this is the end of us
On that you can trust
Don't call here no more
Baby, I'll make it simple &amp; plain (simple &amp; plain yeah)
Just like you did when you was with her
Forget you even know my name (know my name)
Fire &amp; desire
Baby boy you put out the flame (Baby boy you put out the flame)
So you have been retired mmm
Permanently put out the game (Permanently put out the game)
So,
Don't call here no more
We have nothing else to discuss
Baby do what you must
But don't call here no more
Boy this is the end of us
On that you can trust
Don't call here no more
There aint nothin' you can say
That's gon' make me change the way
That I feel about you now
So don't even waste your time
Callin' here cause you may find
That someone else is around
Don't call here no more
There aint nothin' you can say
That's gon' make me change the way
That I feel about you now
So don't even waste your time
Callin' here cause you may find
That someone else is around
Don't call here no more
We have nothing else to discuss
Baby do what you must
But don't call here no more
Boy this is the end of us
On that you can trust
Don't call here no more.
