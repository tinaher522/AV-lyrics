Stop actin crazy imma keep it real
See I just need some one that gives me sumthin I could feel
Have a little small talk and a night on the town
It could all be yours if you go a nother round
Don't wanna loose you in it 'cause the groove iz in it
But it really don't matter long as you be in it

But you ain't leavin till I get a nother taste
I ain't ashamed to say you got a nigga open babe
And imma need some more before you get away

You got ya black berry off and your phone vibrating
And all you wanna noe iz why ma legs keep shakin
See we both grown and I noe wen the feel is right
And wat you sayin is makin me wanna spend the night
And now I focused and I'm open 'cause ya noticed me
And I was hoping you'd say can I take you home with me
