<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Angel">
Where did you go when i woke up
You were gone
Find someone to replace you
I'll never be alone
I sit around so anxious for you to call my phone
She went up to heaven said she'll be back later on
In love wit an angel, she dont belong to me
In love wit an angel, she dont belong to me
In love wit an angel, she dont belong to me
In love wit an angel
I'm in love (x7)
And i just cant chase the clouds out of my mind
She's the cause of my heart ache but i i'll be fine
Cause when we kiss there's no playin around, there's no time
In love wit an angel, she dont belong to me
In love wit an angel, she dont belong to me
In love wit an angel, she dont belong to me
In love wit an angel
I'm in love (x7)
In love wit an angel, she dont belong to me
In love wit an angel, she dont belong to me
In love wit an angel, she dont belong to me
In love wit an angel
I'm in love (x7)
