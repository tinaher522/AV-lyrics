<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Better_Today">
Whoa oh, whoa oh.  
Whoa oh, whoa oh.  
Whoa oh, whoa oh.  
Whoa oh, oh.  
You see it all in my smile.  
You hear it all in my laugh.  
The way I walk, you hear me talk.  
And know I'm no longer sad.  
I got no reason to smile more now than I've ever had.  
I open up my eyes and realize that nothing's quite that bad.  
I've got a different approach to dealing with emotion.  
Keeping control of my boat, while drifting on this ocean.  
Keeping my head to the sky, keeping tears out of my eyes.  
Unless happiness be the reason that I decide to cry.  
And life's too short to dwell on all that's wrong.  
Stand up now, stand up now and I promise not before long.  
You'll be feeling better today.  
Much better today, much better today.  
So much better.  
You're feeling better today.  
Much better today, much better today.  
Much better today.  
You're feeling better today.  
Much better today, much better today.  
So much better.  
You're feeling better today.  
Much better today, much better today.  
You'll be so much better.  
I know about down and out.  
I know about when it gets tough.  
Losing my fight, can't see the light.  
And you just wanna give up.  
I know about being depressed.  
By needing someone to love.  
I also know by standing up and saying enough is enough.  
Oh, I've got a different approach to dealing with emotion.  
Keeping control of my boat, while drifting on this ocean.  
Keeping my head to the sky, keeping tears out of my eyes.  
Unless happiness be the reason I decide to cry.  
And life's too short to dwell on all that's wrong.  
Stand up now, stand up now and I promise not before long.  
You'll be feeling better today.  
Much better today, much better today.  
So much better.  
You're feeling better today.  
Much better today, much better today.  
Much better today.  
You're feeling better today.  
Much better today, much better today.  
So much better.  
You're feeling better today.  
Much better today, much better today.  
You'll be so much better.  
(Ohh whoa. Oh whoa, whoa)  
(Oooh)  
I feel like if I try, I could fly away right now.  
All because I've finally found my smile.  
(x2)  
And you'll be feeling better today.  
Much better today, much better today.  
So much better.  
You're feeling better today.  
Much better today, much better today.  
Much better today.  
You're feeling better today.  
Much better today, much better today.  
So much better.  
You're feeling better today.  
Much better today, much better today.  
You'll be so much better.
