<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Go_To_Sleep">
Ohh, ohh, ohh
Verse 1:
Closing time
Freak shop is over
Candles burned down
Bottles empty (No more champagne)
So divine
Did you enjoy yourself
The look on your face says (Yes)
Eyes closed, biting on your bottom lip
You're reminiscing aren't you
Thinking about what just took place
(The pleasure written on your face)
But its over now
We've done the deed
Headboard is broken
Chorus:
Now it's time to go to sleep
Sugar you warm me up
I know you're tired now
Lets go to sleep
Oh it was good but now, its time to settle down
And go to sleep
And tomorrow we can
Run this thing back again
But lets go to sleep
Lets go to sleep
Lets go to sleep
Babe, babe
Verse 2:
Closing time
I must confess
You backed up on that mess you talked (For real)
I'm tired as hell
I'm just laying here (Starin' at you)
Letting my eyes cover your curvaceous body (Good Lord it was good)
So soft and sexy
Girl I'm almost tempted to just jump right back on you
I'm just playin babe, don't mind me
My back's hurting, (you're out cold)
Chorus:
Now it's time to go to sleep (Oh)
Sugar you warm me up
I know you're tired now (Tired now)
Lets go to sleep (Sleep)
Oh it was good but now, its time to settle down
And go to sleep (Sleep, oh)
And tomorrow we can (Tomorrow we can)
Run this thing back again
But lets go to sleep (Oh)
Lets go to sleep
Lets go to sleep
Babe, sleep
Sugar you warm me up (Warm me up)
I know you're tired now (Tired now)
Lets go to sleep
Oh it was good but now, its time to settle down
And go to sleep
And tomorrow we can (We can)
Run this thing back again (Back again)
But lets go to sleep
Lets go to sleep
Lets go to sleep
Babe, babe
