<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Memories">
[Verse 1]
Found a picture of you today
I almost threw away
It brought things back things I haven't thought of in a while
Stared at the look on your face
Took me back to that place
That my mind would take me every time you'd smile
In love sometimes it seems nothing ever could go wrong
In love
[Pre-Chorus]
You don't realize you're living in a fantasy
Until it's too late
You don't come crashing down into reality
Until she's gone
And all you've got is the memories
[Chorus]
Remember the way
Remember what is 
What will
And all that used to be
It's over
You've gone away
But I can see you ever y
In the memories
[Verse 2]
I remember when we would fight
Almost every night
Just so we could make up in that special way
I tried to get on with life
But every once in a while
I pull up a thought that takes me right back to those day
In love
[Pre-Chorus]
You don't realize you're living in a fantasy
Until it's too late
You don't come crashing down into reality
Until she's gone
And all you've got is the memories
[Chorus x2]
Remember the way
Remember what is 
What will
And all that used to be
It's over
You've gone away
But I can see you ever y
In the memories
Remember the way
Remember what is 
What will
And all that used to be
It's over
You've gone away
But I can see you ever y
In the memories
[Verse 3]
No matter how hard I try
To lie to myself
I just can't deny
The truth
I really miss you
[Chorus x3]
Remember the way
Remember what is 
What will
And all that used to be
It's over
You've gone away
But I can see you ever y
In the memories
Remember the way
Remember what is 
What will
And all that used to be
It's over
You've gone away
But I can see you ever y
In the memories
Remember the way
Remember what is 
What will
And all that used to be
It's over
You've gone away
But I can see you ever y
In the memories
