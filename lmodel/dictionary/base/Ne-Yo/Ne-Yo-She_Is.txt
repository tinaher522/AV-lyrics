<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="She_Is">
Caught up in the whirlwind, I’m just a dragonfly and
And my wings ain’t helping me
I’m in a little trouble, sure didn’t see this coming tonight
Have no clue what I’m gonna do now
And ask me who put me in this way
Ask me who’s responsible for this, she is
She is, everything’s all her fault
Caught up in the whirlwind and no one can help me
Ask me who’s responsible for this, she is
She is, everything’s all her fault
So now I’m in love and I didn’t wanna be
And all because of she, whoa
And all because of she, whoa
Days ain’t long enough, nights are even shorter
This ain’t fair
Time don’t wanna give me what I need
All I’m asking is forever, forever and a moment
Listen to me this ain’t how I turned
I don’t know what she done to me
But I like
And ask me who’s put me in this twist
Ask me who’s responsible for this
She is, everything’s all her fault
Caught up in the whirlwind and no one can help me
Ask me who’s responsible for this, she is
She is, everything’s all her fault
So now I’m in love and I didn’t wanna be
And all because of she, whoa
And all because of she, whoa
Said it’s getting hard for me to picture me without you
For every passing day baby
But it’s easy to win to who’s the owner of my heart
Sent me look at you and say, she is
She is, everything’s all her fault
Caught up in the whirlwind and no one can help me
Ask me who’s responsible for this, she is
She is, everything’s all her fault
So now I’m in love and I didn’t wanna be
And all because of she, whoa
And all because of she, whoa
