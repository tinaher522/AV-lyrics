She gave a round of applause
Followed by a standing ovation
I feel so dumb right now
Standing outside her house
Trying to apologize, cuz i told quite a few lies
(damn) and she found me out
So now I'm saying sorry cuz i am
Though its very clear to me that she don't give a damn
Got me out here putting on a show, neighbors laughing at me
I just want her to know, without her I can't be happy
So I'm putting on a show, I hope it's entertaining
Don't say we're over now, please let me in the house
She said "and the award for the best lie goes to you"
Go make believe, believe that you could be thankful to me
Let's hear your speech how..
She gave a round of applause
Followed by a standing ovation
Got me out here putting on a show, neighbors laughing at me
I just want her to know, without her I can't be happy
So I'm putting on a show, I hope it's entertaining
Don't say we're over now, please let me in the house
Baby please, don't say we're over now....
