<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="If_U_Want_Me_To_Stay">
1st verse:
Got my bags at the door 
I'm getting ready to leave
I can tell there's something you wanna say to me
Baby speak your mind
Cause you're wasting time
It's a quarter to nine
And my car's on the way
You said you wasn't ready for this
So I'm out the door
Or did something in your mind change?
Chorus:
If you want me to stay 
If you want me to stay
Say you want me to stay
Baby stop playing around with me
There ain't no time to play,
If you want me to stay
Baby you've got to show me
2nd verse:
Your eyes and your mouth are saying 2 different things
You need to figure it out ...I'm tired of waiting 
Being indecisive.. it comes with a price n' now your time is almost gone.
I'm hearing " go on and leave " 
You don't care about me
But your eyes are saying you want me home 
Chorus:
If you want me to stay 
If you want me to stay
Say you want me to stay
Baby stop playing around with me
There ain't no time to play,
If you want me to stay
Baby you've got to show me
Show me you want me
Show me you want me babe
Baby show me that you care
Show me you want me babe
Show me you want me babe
Show me that you care.
You've got to show me 
Chorus:
If you want me to stay 
If you want me to stay
Say you want me to stay
Baby stop playing around with me
There ain't no time to play
If you want me to stay
Baby you've got to show me
If you want me to stay 
If you want me to stay
Say you want me to stay
Baby stop playing around with me
There'll be no time to play
If you want me to stay
Baby you've got to show me.
