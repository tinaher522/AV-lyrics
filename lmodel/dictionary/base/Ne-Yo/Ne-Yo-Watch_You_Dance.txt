<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Watch_You_Dance">
She's badder than beautiful , 
Top of her head to her pretty feet.
Her bodys delectable , 
hope that she taste how she looks ... (sweet)
Hook : 
I wanna jump on her bad
but i play it breezy , the desperate man gets the scraps
She sees that im looking at 
her,  she showing out for me  i think im digging that , lil mama
Chorus :
Dont stop doing whatchu do 
Girl i just wanna watch you dance..
(and later on ) we go , go do what we do
but  now i just wanna watch you dance
Keep it moving...

I love how shes moving it 
the way she pops her hips to the beat
like .. (Boom, Boom....Boom Boom )
That's ridiclous ( ridiclous )
i cant belive how hot shes making me
Hook : 
I wanna jump on her bad
but still i play it breezy , the desperate man gets the scraps
She sees that im looking at 
her,  she showing out for me  i think im digging that
Dont stop doing whatchu do 
Girl i just wanna watch you dance..
(and later on ) we go , go do what we do
but  now i just wanna watch you dance
Keep it moving...
