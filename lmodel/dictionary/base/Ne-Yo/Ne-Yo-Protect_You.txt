<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Protect_You">
Check check
One two, one two
When shit gets hard
Ima protect you
Now a days seems like death is the way
Its like the value of life goes down every day
They pushin rocks in this park
Where your children play
But ima be right here
For you come wit me
Singin
Ooooooooh
Ima protect you
When its cold outside babe
Ohh ohh ohh
Ima protect
With everything that i
You cant tell where the darkness begins or it ends
You cant trust yourself let alone your friends
Got the devil at your door
And he wana get in
But ima be that one
On which you can depend
Singin
Oooooooooooh
Ima protect you
When its cold outside babe
Ohh ohh ohh
Ima protect you
With everything that i
The lady of a love just cant get a pass
Cus hate got tittys and a big old ass
Sayin come roll with me
And we'll have a blast
But ima stay right here
Devoted instead of pass
Oooooooooooh
Ima protect you
When its cold outside babe
Ohh ohh ohh
Ima protect you
With everything that i
Tryna pull your arm down and give you the blues
You see that every damn day and every night in the news
The whole damn world
Has got issues
But through the storm and the rain 
Ima be there for you
Singin
Ooooooooooohhh
Ima protect you
When its cold outside babe
Ohh ohh ohh
Ima protect you
