<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Miss_You_Crazy">
I miss you in the morning
Wakin up and
Give me kiss with
Stinky breath now
I miss you in the shower
For two hours
In the bathroom
Now we're both late
I miss you in the mirror and
Doin hair in
Just your panties
Simply sexy
I miss u in the closet
Put your clothes on
Give me that look
Take em off 
I just cant 
Let it go
Let it go
Stop it
Let it go 
Let it go
Stop it
Let it go
Let it go 
Stop it
Girl i wish i could but i miss u
I miss u badly
Badly
I miss u daily
Daily
I miss u baby
Baby
I miss u crazy, crazy
I miss u badly
Badly
I miss u daily
Daily
I miss u baby
Baby
I miss u crazy, crazy
I miss u crazy, crazy
I miss u crazy, crazy
I miss u on the free way
Stuck in traffic
U look at me
Lets be nasty
I miss u when i'm at work
When u text me
Smiley faces
Sexy pictures
I miss u on the way home
Thinkin bout u
Little tattoo
I got one too
I miss u when its night time
In the light then
Turn the lights off
Music on
I just cant 
Let it go
Let it go
Stop it
Let it go 
Let it go
Stop it
Let it go
Let it go 
Stop it
Girl i wish i could but i
I miss u badly
Badly
I miss u daily
Daily
I miss u baby
Baby
I miss u crazy, crazy
I miss u badly
Badly
I miss u daily
Daily
I miss u baby
Baby
I miss u crazy, crazy
I miss u crazy, crazy
I miss u crazy, crazy
U kno my favorite colors red
I miss rice pudding in bed
And how u love my big head
I miss u girl
I kno i made some mistakes
I kno i drove u away
But i just needed to say
I miss u girl
Oh i miss u girl
I miss u badly
Badly
I miss u daily
Daily
I miss u baby
Baby
I miss u crazy, crazy
I miss u badly
Badly
I miss u daily
Daily
I miss u baby
Baby
I miss u crazy, crazy
I miss u crazy, crazy
I miss u crazy, crazy
