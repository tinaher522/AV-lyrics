Mmm
Let me find the pagee
Mmm
Hey yeahh
Come on in 
Shut the
Door behind you girl
Go on n take off all your clothes
Cus you aint gona need those
For what we bouta to do boo
Put back on your shoes ooh
Dont get it confused
I aint sayin 
Anything is wrong wit ur feet
I just think its sexy
When you pose for me
In them red 6 inch stilletoes
You need somethin to
Set the mood
Girl its cool
If u need the music slow 
I'll get it
Low 
I'll get it
Somethin to drink somthin to smoke 
I'll get it
I'll get it
You aint got to move 
Cus i'll get it
Baby i'll get it
Lay down on the bed
Arch your back a little bit
Now 
Just turn your head twords me
Oh so sexy
Let me just stare at you
Hope you got stamina
Let me get my camera
Before we began
Do u need
A sip of that hypno
Toke of that hyrdo
Girl just let me kno
I just want you to be
Comfortable
What you want i got
Dont move from that spot
If u need the music slow 
I'll get it
Low 
I'll get it
Somethin to drink somthin to smoke 
I'll get it
I'll get it
You aint got to move 
Cus i'll get it
Baby i'll get it
Heyy
