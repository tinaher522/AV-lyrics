<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Like_It,_Love_It">
If you like it i love it baby
Its all for you again
Nobody else drive me crazy
The way you do so keep
Moving the way you move
Doing the things you do
To keep me coming right back to you
And baby i like it i like it i like it
And baby i love it i love it i love it
So baby keep
Moving the way you move
Doing the things you do
To keep me coming right back to you
Love drops lollipop
I can be your candy girl
Gypsie roll let me be the centre of your tasty treat
Do sweet, sweet tooth baby im to good for you
Come get a peice of me, (me)
Boy you already no what im all about
When i hit that floor its about to go down
I get right to it
Dont waste no time to do what i do
Im not good and i can prove it by the way that i move
If you like it i love it baby
Its all for you again
Nobody else drive me crazy
The way you do so keep
Moving the way you move
Doing the things you do
To keep me coming right back to you
And baby i like it i like it i like it
And baby i love it i love it i love it
So baby keep
Moving the way you move
Doing the things you do
To keep me coming right back to you
Hear it out lets hit the floor
Better keep up with me
Youve got something body jumping its my ringtone
Hold up stop not jump back with it
Boy keep it moving
Like what i see
Heart just skips a beat
Boy you already no what im all about
When i hit that floor its about to go down
I get right to it
Dont waste no time to do what i do
Im not good and i can prove it by the way that i move
If you like it i love it baby
Its all for you again
Nobody else drive me crazy
The way you do so keep
Moving the way you move
Doing the things you do
To keep me coming right back to you
And baby i like it i like it i like it
And baby i love it i love it i love it
So baby keep
Moving the way you move
Doing the things you do
To keep me coming right back to you
Instrumental break
Boy you already no what im all about
When i hit that floor its about to go down
I get right to it
Dont waste no time to do what i do
Im not good and i can prove it by the way that i move
If you like it i love it baby
Its all for you again
Nobody else drive me crazy
The way you do so keep
Moving the way you move
Doing the things you do
To keep me coming right back to you
And baby i like it i like it i like it
And baby i love it i love it i love it
So baby keep
Moving the way you move
Doing the things you do
To keep me coming right back to you
