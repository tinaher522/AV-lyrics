<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Love_Migraine">
[Verse 1]
It's making my head hurt 
I've got a migrane 
Because 
You're not supposed to be here 
I don't wanna love you 
Your somebody else's 
Yeah 
She made it perfectly clear 
She told me if i saw you tonight 
To tell you 
She forgives you 
And that she knows that we been together for about a year 
She said that she know that i love you 
But not like she does 
I think it'd be best if you got your things 
And got out of here 
I've got a migrane 
[Chorus]
Someone please come stop the pain 
I can't take this love migrane 
My head don't hurt as much as my heart, no 
Someone please come stop the pain 
I can't take this love migrane 
My head don't hurt as much as my heart, no 
Just can't take this love migrane 
[Verse 2]
I wish you'd of told me 
That you had a daughter 
I would have liked to meet her 
It would've been nice 
While we're on the subject 
Of what should've happened 
I guess you could have mentioned the fact 
That you have a wife 
Oh I've got a migraine
[Chorus]
Someone please come stop the pain 
I can't take this love migrane 
My head don't hurt as much as my heart, no 
Someone please come stop the pain 
I can't take this love migrane 
My head don't hurt as much as my heart, no 
Just can't take this love migrane 
Just can't take this love migrane 
[Chorus]
Someone please come stop the pain 
I can't take this love migrane 
My head don't hurt as much as my heart, no 
Someone please come stop the pain 
I can't take this love migrane 
My head don't hurt as much as my heart, no 
Just can't take this love migrane
