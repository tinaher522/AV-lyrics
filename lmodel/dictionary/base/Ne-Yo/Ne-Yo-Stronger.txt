<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Stronger">
Pressure bust pipes but it also makes diomonds
Bottom of the montain and i stop climbin
Getttin knocked down doesnt mean this fight is over
The rain starts falling  and it keeps on pouring
Night time now but the mornings calling
Hard times come and they dont stop coming
But it gets a little easier when you learn from them
Singin
Whoooooaaaaa
Im stronger now than i was then
Singin 
Whooaaaaaaaa
Im stronger than ive ever been
And i dont know whats next for me
But i know that i will be ready
Singin whooooaaaaa
Doesnt make sence but it shuld make knowledge
Runnin from the pain aint the way at all
How you gona learn if you never make a mistake
The rain starts falling  and it keeps on pouring
Night time now but the mornings calling
Hard times come and they dont stop coming
But it gets a little easier when you learn from them
Singin
Whoooooaaaaa
Im stronger now than i was then
Singin 
Whooaaaaaaaa
Im stronger than ive ever been
And i dont know whats next for me
But i know that i will be ready
Singin whooooaaaaa
Whatever doesnt kill you
I think evrybody knows the rest
But you dont understand how true that is
Im living proof of it
Everybodys gonna build up
????????
But what you gotta do is make sure it doesnt kill you
Singin
Whoooooaaaaa
Im stronger now than i was then
Singin 
Whooaaaaaaaa
Im stronger than ive ever been
And i dont know whats next for me
But i know that i will be ready
Singin whooooaaaaa
