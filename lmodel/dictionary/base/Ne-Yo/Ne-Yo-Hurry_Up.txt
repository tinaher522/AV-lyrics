VERSE - 1
Dont remember where we met all i do know..
Is i said how she look me up and down she said lets go
So we went to her spot off the back blazin hot clothes
Cam off it was on headboard broke mind was blown
After the session she checked the messages on her cell..
All of the sudden her face just froze and her eyes got big as
Hell...the message said hey baby surprise surprise girl im free 
I'll be home around 3 and it was already 3:15...she said (hurry up) 
HOOK
