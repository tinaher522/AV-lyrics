<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Irreplaceable">
to the right to the right
get to steppin
to the right to the right, to the right to the right
thats where im goin in the middle of the night
now in the closet, thats yo stuff but trick i bought it so bitch dont touch
you talk alot of bullshit, alright
but while you walk and talk imma get mine now
its my name thats on your las
your bald headed rat tryna get ridda that
back up out my face fraud, im really not tryna talk to you
talkin bout, im never gunna find a girl like you
you must got me fucked up
you must not know bout me, you must think im playing
cuz i can have another you in a hour
matter fact shes upstairs in the shower, babaaay
you must not know bout me, you must think im playing
i can find another you on the corner
so dont you ever for a second get to thinkin you're irreplaceable
trick gimme my phone so i can call my chick and see if shes home yeah
oh shit i forgot shes already home
what did you think, i was putting you out for...
cuz you was unreal, kinna like the horse thats sitting on the back of your head
baby fix them teeth, seeing your face is so old to me
back up out my face fraud, im really not tryna talk to you

tellin me im never findin a girl like you, but you got me so damn twisted
you must not know bout me, you must think im playing
cuz i can have another you in a minute
matter fact she'll drive up in a minute babaaay
you must not know bout me
you must think im playing
ill have another you in a hour
so dont you ever for a second get to thinkin youre irreplaceable
so since im not your everything, im not givin you anything, nothing at all to you
baby im not giving you nothing no way so go ahead and shed your tears
cuz the truth of the matter is replacing you was done lastyear
to the right to the right, to the right to the right
to the right to the right, to the right to the right
so dont you ever for a second get to thinkin, to get to thinkin, to get to thinkin youre irreplaceable
you must not know bout me, you must think im playing (you must not know)
i can have another you in a minute, matter fact she'll be here in a minute babaaay
you must not know bout me, you must think im playing
i can have another you in a hour, matter fact shes upstairs in the shower (oh oh ohy)
you must not know bout me, you must think im playing
(i) i can find another you baby, theres so many of you baby
you must not know bout me, you must think im playing
(gold diggin, two timin, backstabbin, im not lying, always needin, i need somethin, ya hoe)
but the truth is you have always been replaceable
please see yourself out this way.
