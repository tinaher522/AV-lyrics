<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Talking_In_Your_Sleep">
[Verse 1]
Bits and pieces
Of information
While you're sleeping
I'm interrogating
It's normally not my style
But I just can't help it
You said a name
And I just felt it
Just so I could be totally sure
I let you talk a little more
[Chorus]
Before I said
Wake up wake up
You're talking in your sleep again
You won't believe all the questions you've been answering
Now get up 
Get up
Tell one of your little friends
To pick you up
Cuz I know all I need to know
To wake you up
And show you the door
That's what you get for talking in your sleep
That's what you get for talking in your sleep
That's what you get for talking in your sleep
That's what you get for talking in your sleep
That's what you get for talking in your sleep
That's what you get for talking in your sleep
[Verse 2]
You said the party
Was really jumping
Then you said Herman
Something something
I couldn't make out that part 
So I kept on going
He's digging a whole
And he's not even knowing
Just so I could be totally sure
I let you talk a little more
[Chorus]
Before I said
Wake up wake up
You're talking in your sleep again
You won't believe all the questions you've been answering
Now get up 
Get up
Tell one of your little friends
To pick you up
Cuz I know all I need to know
To wake you up
And show you the door
That's what you get for talking in your sleep
That's what you get for talking in your sleep
That's what you get for talking in your sleep
That's what you get for talking in your sleep
That's what you get for talking in your sleep
That's what you get for talking in your sleep
[Chorus]
Wake up wake up
You're talking in your sleep again
You won't believe all the questions you've been answering
Now get up 
Get up
Tell one of your little friends
To pick you up
Cuz I know all I need to know
To wake you up
And show you the door
That's what you get for talking in your sleep
That's what you get for talking in your sleep
That's what you get for talking in your sleep
That's what you get for talking in your sleep
That's what you get for talking in your sleep
That's what you get for talking in your sleep
