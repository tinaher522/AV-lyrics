<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Cause_I_Said_So">
Do it cuz you want you
You want to cuz I said so
[Verse 1]
Everybody looking at her
They can move right away
You can see it in her movement
That the girl don't play
A walking danger
One look in her eyes
You do what she want you to
And you won't even know why
[Pre-Chorus]
Everybody wanna touch it 
Touch it
And they give up preserve
She can make you love it 
Love it
Even if it hurts
From her head to my toes
She's out of control
She can reach right in your chest
And pull out your soul
[Chorus]
She said don't ask no questions
Do it cuz I said so
You're under my control
Do it cuz I said so
Just keep on loving me
Do it cuz I said so
Do it cuz you want to
You want to cuz I said so
She said don't ask no questions
Do it cuz I said so
You're under my control
Do it cuz I said so
Just keep on loving me
Do it cuz I said so
Do it cuz you want to
You want to cuz I said so
[Verse 2]
She got what you want 
But more than you can take
Under those dark glasses
Baby eyes of a snake
Her swagger is sexy
So wrong but so right
And though the venom is deadly
Still you beg for the bite
[Pre-Chorus]
Everybody wanna touch it 
Touch it
And they give up preserve
She can make you love it 
Love it
Even if it hurts
From her head to my toes
She's out of control
She can reach right in your chest
And pull out your soul
[Chorus]
She said don't ask no questions
Do it cuz I said so
You're under my control
Do it cuz I said so
Just keep on loving me
Do it cuz I said so
Do it cuz you want to
You want to cuz I said so
She said don't ask no questions
Do it cuz I said so
You're under my control
Do it cuz I said so
Just keep on loving me
Do it cuz I said so
Do it cuz you want to
You want to cuz I said so
[Verse 3]
Do it cuz you want to
You want to cuz I said so
Do it cuz you want to
You want to cuz I said so
Do it cuz you want to
You want to cuz I said so
Do it cuz you want to
You want to cuz I said so
Do it cuz you want to
You want to cuz I said so
Do it cuz you want to
You want to cuz I said so
Do it cuz you want to
You want to cuz I said so
Do it cuz you want to
You want to cuz I said so
[Chorus]
She said don't ask no questions
Do it cuz I said so
You're under my control
Do it cuz I said so
Just keep on loving me
Do it cuz I said so
Do it cuz you want to
You want to cuz I said so
She said don't ask no questions
Do it cuz I said so
You're under my control
Do it cuz I said so
Just keep on loving me
Do it cuz I said so
Do it cuz you want to
You want to cuz I said so
