[Verse 1]
Hello 
Well what's cracking
Salutations
This one here be the explination
The answer 
Of the question being
Who's the flyest 
In the spot this evening
Don't mean to interrupt your flow
Had to stop by to let you know
In the words of Andre 3000
If you ain't the one with the throwed tie
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm go getta getting my fly young man on
Lean like a pimp but I do stand though
On two
Grown to a nigga health
I can do bad by myself
So what up ma
Where you at with yours
Do you gently knock
If you kick down doros
If so baby girl maybe we can ride
Kick a few down side by side
What you say mamma
[Chorus]
God bless the woman that can hold her own
For the chick that make moves
Put your drinks up
This one is for you
God bless the woman that can hold her own
If you got your own loot
Put your drinks up
This one is for you
[Verse 2]
Your exterior look right
Tell me what your life like
What's your story girl
Came out to enjoy the nightlife
Certainly the wife type
She's a rose amongst the weeds
Diamonds amongst the seeds
And I need a chick that's gonna shine like I do
Grind like I do
I searched the club all night to find you
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm go getta getting my fly young man on
Lean like a pimp but I do stand though
On two
Grown to a nigga health
I can do bad by myself
So what up ma
Where you at with yours
Do you gently knock
If you kick down doros
If so baby girl maybe we can ride
Kick a few down side by side
What you say mamma
[Chorus]
God bless the woman that can hold her own
For the chick that make moves
Put your drinks up
This one is for you
God bless the woman that can hold her own
If you got your own loot
Put your drinks up
This one is for you
[Verse 3]
Girl I like the way
That you do what you do
Grinding 
Taking care of you girl
Put your drinks up
Girl I like the way
That your hat match your shoes
Just as fly as you want to girl
Put your drinks up
This here is for you
You
God bless the woman that can hold her own
God bless the woman that can hold her own
