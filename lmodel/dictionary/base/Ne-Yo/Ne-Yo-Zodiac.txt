<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Zodiac">
Now I don't mean to be rude
But I really don't care what your sign is
I'm trying to get to know you
Now let me get it straight
[Verse 1]
I've never been one to lick up mockery 
If anything anyone else believes
If it makes you happy then yes
Do you
But personally 
I don't waste my time
Being concerned with your sign
Sugar I truly could care less
So true
[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me on your inside you're as cool as a gentle breeze
But truthfully what's that information
Really gonna do for me
Wanna know what makes you laugh
What makes you cry
I don't care about every other person
That was born in July
If that's even right
[Chorus]
I don't give a damn about your zodiac
I'd rather get to know you
Baby I don't care
I don't give a damn about your zodiac
I'd rather get to know you
[Verse 2]
She said hi
I'm Lisa 
I'm a Virgo
I turned around and said so
Great to know
But really I don't care
She regained her composure
And said what's your sign
I'm a Libra but never mind
I'm feeling you
Let's go somewhere 
[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me on your inside you're as cool as a gentle breeze
But truthfully what's that information
Really gonna do for me
Wanna know what makes you laugh
What makes you cry
I don't care about every other person
That was born in July
If that's even right
[Chorus]
I don't give a damn about your zodiac
I'd rather get to know you
Baby I don't care
I don't give a damn about your zodiac
I'd rather get to know you
[Verse 3]
I don't care
About that there
Let's get this clear
I wanna know you
Wanna get to know
You personal
Not astrological
I wanna know you
Wanna get to know you
[Chorus x2]
I don't give a damn about your zodiac
I'd rather get to know you
Baby I don't care
I don't give a damn about your zodiac
I'd rather get to know you
I don't give a damn about your zodiac
I'd rather get to know you
Baby I don't care
I don't give a damn about your zodiac
I'd rather get to know you
