<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Can't_Shake_Loose">
She got hold of me.
She got hold of me.
She got hold of me.
And I just can't shake loose.
She got hold of me.
She got hold of me.
She got hold of me.
And I just can't shake loose.
In my heart..
In my head..
In my room..
In my bed.. naked.
And I can't take it.
I can't shake this _____.
We had drinks, vision blurred.
Chill my bone, and she whipered "take it".
And no mistake it was, I should have known.
And now I'm caught up, not in the right state of mind.
She fine.
But I ain't supposed to be this open.
Gotta get myself together.
Gotta figure out my plan.
Cause the fact is that she's married, and I ain't her husband.
It's another fine mess I done got into.
Whats wrong with me?
She got hold of me.
She got hold of me.
It's another fine mess I done got into.
What's wrong wtih me?
She got hold of me.
And I just can't shake loose.
So damn wrong, so damn dumb.
I went back more than once, four times.
Went for more times.
Sometimes back to back.
Could not help how it feel.
Though I know karma's real.
No crime, but even this time, there's escape in that.
Cause now I'm caught up, not in the right state of mind.
She fine.
But I ain't supposed to be this open.
Gotta get myself together.
Gotta figure out my plan.
Cause the fact is that she's married, and I ain't her husband.	
It's another fine mess I done got into.
Whats wrong with me?
She got hold of me.
She got hold of me.
It's another fine mess I done got into.
What's wrong wtih me?
She got hold of me.
And I just can't shake loose.
Whatcha thinking bout?
Whatcha thinking bout?
Boy whatcha thinking bout?
Whatcha thinking bout?
She got hold of me.
And I just can't shake loose.
Whatcha thinking bout?
Whatcha thinking bout?
Boy whatcha thinking bout?
Whatcha thinking bout?
She got hold of me.
And I just can't shake loose.
It's another fine mess I done got into.
Whats wrong with me?
She got hold of me.
She got hold of me.
It's another fine mess I done got into.
What's wrong wtih me?
She got hold of me.
And I just can't shake loose.
It's another fine mess I done got into.
Whats wrong with me?
She got hold of me.
She got hold of me.
It's another fine mess I done got into.
What's wrong wtih me?
She got hold of me.
And I just can't shake loose, no.
She got hold of me.
She got hold of me.
She got hold of me.
And I just can't shake loose, no.
