<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="That's_What_It_Does">
Thirty seconds before you turned on this song
You was feeling something, something was wrong
Now that it's on there's a smile on your face
And whatever was wrong, it's faded away
For the moment, the song will change your life
But if you believe, well it just might
If you listen right, the part that touches your heart and your soul
That's what it does
:Chorus:
And it might make you lose your mind, that's what it does
And it might make you cry sometimes, that's what it does
And it might chase the pain away, that's what it does
The devil, the angel, the pain and the pleasure
The music, that's what it does
Yesterday you were crying the loss of a man, 
A woman whatever, you understand
Turned on the song or release from the soreness of crying
You wound up crying some more
On your back, on the floor you continue to cry
As the strings in the background kill you inside
But you never felt so alive
It is, it will be and it was

The house of fire, your and your love
said it is, it will be and it was
That's what it does
:Chorus:
And it might make you lose your mind, that's what it does
And it might make you cry sometimes, that's what it does
And it might chase the pain away, that's what it does
The devil, the angel, the pain and the pleasure
The music, that's what it does
ooh ooh that's what it does
(Women)
And it might make you lose your mind
And it might make you cry sometimes
And it might chase the pain away 
(ooh ooh ooh ooh)
(woman)
And it make you lose your mind
And it might make you lose your mind, that's what it does (it might make you cry sometimes)
And it might make you cry sometimes, that's what it does (it might chase the pain away)
And it might chase the pain away, that's what it does (I say the devil the angel the pain and the pleasure)
The devil, the angel, the pain and the pleasure (of the music)
The music, that's what it does
