<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Move_Along">
You can move along
I believe that we are done
With Whatever we was trying to do
'Cause you up and did me wrong
Cupid got a big gun with a blindfold
She gave another brother access to a little black dress
You know the one, short silky and backless
Dude named Oscar, like she was an actress
I caught them wrestling pinned to the mattress
Now she's lying to my face
Eyes burning up like her words was mace
I don't even hear what she was trying to say
Song playing in my head, irreplaceable
To the lies im deaf
All I can here is to the left, to the left
So I say get out and don't touch that jacket
Your stuff, I already packed it
Mm being polite.
[Chorus]
I don't wanna be rude, i don't mean to be mean but i don't gotta deal with this mess
Telling me I need you when you know you need me
But if that's how you feel you can just
Move along, move along, move along, move along
No argument, no fight
Move along, move along, move along, move along
Im just trying to be polite
And if I seem a bit chill
It's because I don't sweat the small
Find another girl, please believe i will
I aint tripping off you at all
A boss from the beginning
Been there for a minute
So me losing you was me still me winning
Found out about you sinning
So you wonder what the hell im dreaming
Now you're lying to my face
Eyes burning up like her words was mace
I don't even hear what you're was trying say
Song playing in my head, irreplaceable
To the lies im deaf
All I can here is to the left to the left
So I say get out and don't touch that jacket
Your stuff, I already packed it
Im being polite
[Chorus]
I don't wanna be rude, i don't mean to be mean but I don't gotta deal with this mess
Telling me I need you when you know you need me
But if that's how you feel you can just
Move along, move along, move along, move along
No argument, no fight
Move along, move along, move along, move along
Im just trying to be polite
Please don't get me wrong
Baby understand im trying to say get gone, the nicest way I can 
'Cause im not what you want
See I tried to make this work but our loves in the dirt, so lets See who calls who first
Im moving along
[Chorus]
I don't wanna be rude, I don't mean to be mean
Telling me I need you when you know you need me
Move along, move along, move along, move along
No argument, no fight
Move along, move along, move along, move along...
Im just trying to be polite
I don't wanna be rude, i don't mean to be mean but I don't gotta deal with this mess
Telling me I need you when you know you need me
But if that's how you feel you can just
Move along, move along, move along, move along
No argument, no fight
Move along, move along, move along, move along
Im just trying to be polite
