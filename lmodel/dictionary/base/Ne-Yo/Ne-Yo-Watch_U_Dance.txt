<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Watch_U_Dance">
She's badder then beautiful
Top of her head to her pretty feet
Her body's delectable , hope that she taste how she looks .. ( sweet )
I wanna jump on her bad
But, I play it breezy
A desperate man gets the scraps, yeahh
She see that I'm looking at
Huuh she showing out for me
I thinking I'm digging that, you mama
Don't stop doing what you do
Girl I just wanna watch you dance
And later on, we go, go do what we do
Right now I just, wanna watch you dance
Keep it moving
I love how she moving it
The way she pops her hips to the beat
Like'boom boom'boom boom
That's ridiculous (ridiculous)
I can't believe how hot she's making me
I wanna jump on her bad
Still, I play it breezy
A desperate man gets the scraps
She see that I'm looking at
Huuh she showing out for me
I thinking I'm digging that woowoeeeee
Don't stop doing what you do
Girl I just wanna watch you dance
And later on, we go, go do what we do
Right now I just, wanna watch you dance
Keep it moving
mmmmmm..
wanna watch you dance (2x)
Don't stop doing what you do
Girl I just wanna watch you dance
And later on, we go, go do what we do
Right now I just, wanna watch you dance
Keep it moving
Girl I just wanna watch you dance
Right now I just wanna watch you dance
Keep it moving
