Verse 1:
Hot damn she got your man open
Window all the way up on a sunny day
Umbrellas whenever it decides to rain
In 7/11 and its killing me
She got me physic and I'm Pimpin
I can't even walk with a limp no more
Like taking away your past provoke
Crazy part about is that I like it though
Chorus:
I'm a new man
She changed the game
She came and tamed me
I aint the same (No)
Damn its kinda strange
But a boy cant complain
She hold me downnn
I dunno how but love came around
And just flipped us out
(Love) If this is what sprung is yo!
I ?ve gotta sprung a long time ago
She's so ghetto, so ghetto, so hood
Everything I like
She the truth 
So far look and smell good
Shawty keep it high
She's the truth
Get right lil? mama we could
Run with me for life
You the truth
That girl so thorough
Oh that girl is good
Verse 2:
(oh) She's so ghetto, so ghetto, so hood
(What?) Stay fly, look and smell good
Shawty keep a name brand
On a frame 10
A 10 until make fellow get a grown man 
Use the prop game
And I'm like shots for a mascaras
But Im done with that
So grown that I only need one for that
One god on my team 
Im on for that
Chorus:
I'm a new man
She changed the game
She came and tamed me
I aint the same (No)
Damn its kinda strange
But a boy cant complain
She hold me downnn
I dunno how but love came around
And just flipped us out
(Love) If this is what sprung is yo!
I ?ve gotta sprung a long time ago
Shawty! Would you sign me up
Cuz im feeling this road game
Shawty! I cant get enough
Cuz this is whats up
She's so ghetto, so ghetto, so hood
Everything I like
She the truth 
So far look and smell good
Shawty keep it high
She's the truth
Get right lil? mama we could
Run with me for life
You the truth
That girl so thorough
Oh that girl is good
She's the truth
She's so ghetto, so ghetto, so hood
Everything I like
She the truth 
So far look and smell good
Shawty keep it high
She's the truth
Get right lil? mama we could
Run with me for life
You the truth
That girl so thorough
Oh that girl is good
She's the truth
