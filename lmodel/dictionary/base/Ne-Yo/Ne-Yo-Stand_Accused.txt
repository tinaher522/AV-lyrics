<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Stand_Accused">
How you gona say you wana talk
Turn around and put your hands all in my face
You need to calm down
Screamin n cussin n goin off
Claimin i wasnt where i said i was yesterday
Now you say 
You love me
You dont trust me
You drivin me crazy
Trippin on me daily, baby
Kept on pushin, shovin
Im gon up n leave
Cus baby your drama i dont need
If you wana stress yourself thats fine
But u aint bouta drive me out my mind
Girl im through
Everything i say u think im lyin
Its like no matter what i do girl i
Stand acussed
Baby ive had it up to here
Cant tolerate no more
This aint gon work
As much as it hurts me ive got to go
Girl
Maybe if u wasnt so insecure
U wouldnt always think that
Im doin dirt
When i said i loved you
Girl it was true
All i wanted to do
Was be a good man to you baby
But u kept on pushin, shovin
Had to up n leave
Really wish you could believe me baby, baby
If you wana stress yourself thats fine
But u aint bouta drive me out my mind
Girl im through
Baby im so through wit u
Everything i say u think im lyin
Its like no matter what i do girl i
Stand acussed
Baby this is no 
Longer 
Open for dicussion
Tellin me u love me 
You dont wana trust in me
What'd i tell ya?
So i cant stay
This is my testimony
You wana be the judge, jury, and the execution
But im done with this case
Have to find a new one
Someone thats lovin me for me
If you wana stress yourself thats fine
But u aint bouta drive me out my mind
Girl im throught
Everythin i say u think im lyin
Its like no matter what i do girl i
Stand acussed
