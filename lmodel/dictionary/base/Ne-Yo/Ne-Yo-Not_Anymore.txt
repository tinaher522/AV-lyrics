<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Not_Anymore">
This is dedicated to
This, This, This is dedicated to
Mmmmmm, well if your feeling like Im feeling, then this is dedicated to you
Well, Ive been the super girlfriend
Let you think that nothing bother me
Like when you go out with your friends
And people bring me back the stories
The stories bout them other girls
Bout this one, and that one, and those three
So when I ask a simple question (Where were you last night?)
You wanna yell and scream and try to flip it on me
No, No, Noooo (No, No)
Is anybody else just fed up?
If you heard it all befoe, foe, foe (foe, foe)
Then right where you are just get up
Chorus (2X):
Somebody say, I dont want it anymore
I dont want it anymore
Somebody say, I dont want it anymore
I dont want it anymore
Cause Ive dried my eyes and I realized
I deserve somebody thatll treat me right
Somebody say, I dont want it anymore
I dont want it anymore
Somebody say, I dont want it anymore
I dont want it anymore
Because I know my word so you can keep
That drama, I dont want it anymore
Ooooh, oh, oh oh, not anymore
Mmmmm, no more settling for less
Im looking for that kind of man
Thats gonna give his best, cause Im giving my best
A man that wants to cherish this
And knows exactly how to woo me
Not some silly little boy
Who wants my goodies cause he took me to the movies
No, No, Noooo (No, No)
Is anybody else just fed up?
If you heard it all befoe, foe, foe (foe, foe)
Not Anymore lyrics on
Then right where you are just get up
Chorus (2X):
Somebody say, I dont want it anymore
I dont want it anymore
Somebody say, I dont want it anymore
I dont want it anymore
Cause Ive dried my eyes and I realized
I deserve somebody thatll treat me right
Somebody say, I dont want it anymore
I dont want it anymore
Somebody say, I dont want it anymore
I dont want it anymore
Because I know my word so you can keep
That drama, I dont want it anymore
Ooooh, oh, oh oh, not anymore
Ooooh, oh, oh oh, not anymore (walking out the door)
Ooooh, oh, oh oh, not anymore (no, not anymore)
Ooooh, oh, oh oh, not anymore
Ooooh, oh, oh oh, not anymore
Ooooh, oh, oh oh, not anymore
Ooooh, oh, oh oh, not anymore (not no more, not no more, Im gone)
Ooooh, oh, oh oh, not anymore (Nooooooooooo)
This is dedicated to(better leave in a day)
This, this, this is dedicated to(wipe the tears from my face)
Mmmmm, well if you feeling like Im feeling, then this is dedicted to you (if you feel me say)
Somebody say, I dont want it anymore
I dont want it anymore
Somebody say, I dont want it anymore
I dont want it anymore
Cause Ive dried my eyes and I realized
I deserve somebody thatll treat me right
Somebody say, I dont want it anymore
I dont want it anymore
Somebody say, I dont want it anymore
I dont want it anymore
Because I know my word so you can keep
That drama, I dont want it anymore
Ooooh, oh, oh oh, not anymore
