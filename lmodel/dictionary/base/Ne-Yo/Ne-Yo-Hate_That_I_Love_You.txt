<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Hate_That_I_Love_You">
Yeah, hey, hey
That's how much I love you
(Yeah)
That's how much I need you
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
And I can't stand you
Must everything you do make me wanna smile
And then I like you for a while
No
But you won't let me
You upset me, girl and then you kiss my lips
All of a sudden I forget that I was upset
Can't remember what you did
But I hate it
You know exactly what to do
So that I can't stay mad at you for too long
That's wrong
But I hate it
You know exactly how to touch
So that I don't wanna fuss and fight no more
Said I despise that I adore you
And I hate how much I love you, boy
(Yeah)
I can't stand how much I need you
(I need you)
And I hate how much, I love you, boy
(Yeah, oh)
But I just can't let you go
And I hate that I love you so
Ooh and you completely know
The power that you have
(The power that you have)
The only one that makes me laugh
Sad and it's not fair
How you take advantage of the fact that I
(i)
Love you beyond a reason why
(Why)
And it just ain't right
And I hate how much I love you, girl
I can't stand how much I need you
(Hey yeah)
And I hate how much I love you, girl
But I just can't let you go
And I hate that I love you so
One of these days maybe your magic won't affect me
And your kiss will make me weak
But no one in this world knows me the way you know me
So you'll probably always have a spell on me
Yeah, oh, oh, oh, yeah
It's how much I love you
(Much I need you)
It's how much I need you
(Oh)
It's how much I love you
(Oh)
It's how much I need you
And I hate that I love you
So
And I hate how much I love you, boy
I can't stand how much I need you
(Hey, can't stand how much I need you)
And I hate how much I love you boy
(Yeah oh)
But I just can't let you go
(But I just can't let you, no)
And I hate that I love you so
And I hate that I love you so, so
