Ooh, is somethin' about,
Just somethin' about the way she move,
I can't figure it out,
It's somethin' about her
(Say) Ooh, is somethin' about,
Kinda woman that want you but don't need you,
(Hey) I can't figure it out,
It's somethin' about her.
'Cause she walk like a boss,
Talk like a boss,
Manicure nails just set the pedicure off,
She's fly effortlessly, (effortlessly)
And she move like a boss,
Do what a boss,
Do, she got me thinkin' about gettin' involved, (involved)
That's the kinda girl I need, oh.
She got her own thing,
That's why I love her,

Ooh, the way me shine,

Ooh, there's somethin' about,
Kinda woman that can do for herself,
I look at her and it makes me proud,
There's somethin' about her
Somethin', ooh, so sexy about,
Kinda woman that don't even need my help,
She said she got it, she got it, (she said she got it, she got it)
No doubt, there's something about her. (there's somethin' about her)
'Cause she work like the boss,
Play like the boss,
Car and the crib she 'bout to pay 'em both off, (both off)
And bills are payed on time, yeah
She made for a boss,
Only a boss,
Anything less she tellin' them to get lost, (get lost)
That's the girl that's on my mind.
She got her own thing,

Miss Independent,
Won't you come and spend a little time
She got her own thing,
That's why I love her,

Don't worry I got it, (mmhm)
And everything she got,
