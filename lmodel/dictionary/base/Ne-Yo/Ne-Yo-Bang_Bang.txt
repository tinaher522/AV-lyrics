<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Bang_Bang">
Never thought that it be
She get tired of me
And leave me all alooooooooone
But she did
Looking back on the argument
All of it seems to turn into a great big blur
Don't they call all that the said this relationship is dead
Dead in the water I thought a response to my blatant
This respect would be heard
Regular thing regular thing die a bit
Individual and get over it get over it
Not this time
Shawty got hip to the game
Not this line
Oh that line will work
I normally can talk a bum into buying dirt
I normally can talk a nun up out her skirt
But not this time
She wasn't go far for my sweet talk
No not at all
Nobody to blame was all my fault
Trying to be slick messed around and got caught
I assumed she would forgive me
But instead she said she's leaving
(Chorus)
Click Click Bang Bang
She hit me with
Click Click Bang Bang
Shot right through my heart
Click Click Bang Bang
Trouble self but baby it shot me down
Click Click Bang Bang
She hit me with
Click Click Bang Bang
Shot right through my heart

Click Click Bang Bang
Trouble self but baby it shot me down
Well I messed up and talked to a girl
And my world bout to crumble before my eyes
I don't know I did it
But she was bad so I did it Oh
And when I say I did it
I mean I did it, I smacked it, I flipped it, I rubbed it, she loved it
So much she had to tell her girlfriend
Who happened to be my girlfriend
Ooooooooohhhhhhh
I guessed that was the straw that broke the camels back
Cause there was no talking after that
Came home and here bags were already packed
Not this time
She wasn't go far for my sweet talk
No not at all
Nobody to blame was all my fault
Trying to be slick messed around and got caught
I assumed she would forgive me
But instead she said she's leaving
(Chorus X2)
