Hmmm,mmmm
Lets Leave off the lights
I cordially do invite
You and your appetite
To an experience event 
Thats sure to blow your mind
Sip on a little wine
But lets get the candle light
I'm in the mood to experiment tonight
Lets leave off the lights
Hmmm mmmm 
Girl i really hope that 
You don't mind..yeah
Lets leave off the lights
Ooohh i wanna see it all tonight
Lets leave off the lights
Ooh 
Making love I'm staring in your eyes,
Lets leave off the lights
It will make it so good 
So good
Lets leave off the lights
It's not that I dont love the spark
Of sex with you in the dark
Just letting our imagination run wild
But oooh
I think its sexy too 
Watching our body move
Following every curve of sexy you
Lets leave off the lights...Baby
Girl i really hope that 
Lets leave off the lights
Oooh I just wanna see it all tonight
Lets leave off the lights
Making love I'm staring in your eyes,
I'm staring in your eyes
Lets leave off the lights
It will make it so good 
So good
Make it so good 
Lets leave off the lights
Girl i really hope that 
You don't mind
That you don't mind baby
Lets leave off the lights
I wanna see it all tonight
I wanna see it all
Lets leave off the lights
Making love I'm staring in your eyes
In your eyes
Lets leave off the lights
It will make it so good 
So good
Lets leave off the lights
