<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Champagne_Life_Remix">
It's a beautiful day
It's gon' be a beautiful night
Break out the champagne, everybody get a glass
Let's start it off sexy, what do ya say?
And all the ladies say, uh-huh
And all the ladies say, uh-huh
I think I like that
And all the ladies say, uh-huh
Welcome to the champagne life
Where trouble is a bubble in the champagne glass
Dreams and reality are one and the same
And we gon' do it like this
Oh, got an addiction for life and this livin'
Like everyday's my birthday, know what I'm gettin'
And reserved for top notch, that's where I'm sittin'
Me and my friends and found six Miss Independents
And my attitude's so chill and so breezy
In my designer suit, I make this look easy
Sexy baby, don't you dare act like you don't see me
Baby, I know you see me
It's all about them fast car nights
And them big bold days
Livin' this champagne life, everything's okay
Let's toast it up, oh, let's toast it up, oh
Said we play all night and we play all day
Livin' this champagne life, everything's okay
Let's toast it up, oh, baby let's toast it up
Oh, champagne life
I got penthouse property on cloud nine
I got the sun, tell its girls the way I shine
And reserved for top notch, that's how I do mine
A nice meal and a good wine, definition of a good time
Livin' out my dreams, watchin' 'em come true
And baby, I'm a boss, I don't know what they do
And if you're down to ride, come on and I'll take you
I know you want me to take you
To where it's all about them fast car nights
And them big bold days
Livin' this champagne life, everything's okay
Let's toast it up, oh, everybody let's toast it up, ooh
Said could we play all night and we play all day
Livin' this champagne life, everything's okay
Let's toast it up, oh, baby, let's toast it up
Oh, oh, champagne life
Hey, we don't even clap the same when we livin' that champagne life
Sexier than a regular clap
Oh it's a party reserved for top notch
Let's bring it back
Said it's all about them fast car nights
And them big bold days
Livin' this champagne life, everything's okay
So let's toast it up, oh, and everybody let's toast it up, ooh woo
So, oh, oh, oh, could we play all night
And we play all day
Livin' this champagne life, everything's okay
Let's toast it up, oh, baby, let's toast it up
Oh, champagne life
