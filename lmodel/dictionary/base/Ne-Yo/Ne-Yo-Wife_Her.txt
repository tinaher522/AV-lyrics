<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Wife_Her">
She's the type of chick
Can't live without
Take her home
Let her meet your momma
Won't trip when your phone
Rings off the hook
Ain't with that extra drama
Overlooks the fact
That sometimes
You don't know how to act
When you get a little tipsy
Or trippin' or flippin'
She sucks it in
Can keep her cool
Won't show out
On you while
You around your fellas
Find some more pics
Of you and your ex's
And she don't get jealous
Even when you
Get locked up
You can call her up
She's there for you
That's the kind of girl
You need
One that you can wifey
Chorus (2x):
Sometimes
You don't know how
What you've got
'Til you lose
What you've got
When you should
Just wife her
Don't wait too late
You'll miss
A good thing
Go and get the ring
And tell her
That you wife her
The type of chick
That won't get slick
And keep you
From your kids
Won't get buck
Wild and clown
Now she's telling
All your biz
A queen
You don't have
To crown
She knows how
To hold it down
Likes to feel you
Inside her
And she tells you
Don't give out
Even though
She's temporary
She keeps it tight
Just like your married
She'll be the same
Without the ring
Cause she knows
How to play the game
And when you
Can't do without
She maxes out
The cards for you
That's the kind of girl
You need
One that you can wifey
(Chorus 2x) 
She'll fix
Your credit
But the Jordan's
On the debit
Better pay her back
But she insists
That you
Don't sweat it
She's no groupie
Tell me I'm her
One and only
Ghetto superstar
On the right next
To my heart
(Chorus)
