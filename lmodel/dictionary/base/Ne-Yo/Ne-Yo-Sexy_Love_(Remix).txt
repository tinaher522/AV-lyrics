(feat. Candace Jones)
My sexy love... (so sexy...)
[Verse 1:]
[Ne-Yo:] She makes the hairs on the back of my neck stand up (I Do)
Just one touch (Thank You)
[Candace:] I still get butterflies every time he pass bye. 
I cant say why.
[Ne-Yo:] And I just can't think (of anything else I'd rather do)
[Candace:] Than to hear you sing (sing my name the way you do)
[Ne-Yo:] When we do our thing (when we do the things we do)
[together:]
Babygirl you make me say (Ohh ohhh ohhhh)
Babyboy you make my say(ohh ohhh ohhhh)
[Chorus:]
Sexy love girl the things you do
(OH BABY BABY) KEEPS sprung, keep running back to you
Oh I love making love to you
[Together:]
Babygirl you know you're my (sexy love...)
Babyboy you know you're my(sexy love...)
[Candace:] He makes the hairs on the back of my neck stand up.
Just one touch. (And Then)
[Ne-Yo:] Say that I'm simp and I'm sprung all of the above
I can't help she makes me say (Ohh ohhh ohhhh)
[Ne-Yo:] And I just can't think (of anything else I'd rather do)
[Candace:] Than to hear you sing (sing) (sing my name the way you do)
