(Ouu Ouu Ouu)
(Mmdouou..ooh)
(Ouuohh Ouuohhouuoh wouh)
(Mm..ah)
(Verse 1)
Want to but I can't help it.
I love the way it feels.
This got me stuck between my fantasy and what is real.
I need it when I want it.
I want it when I don't.
Tell myself I'd stop everyday,
Knowing that I won't
(Hook #1)
I've got a problem and I.. (don't know what to do about it)
Even if I did, I don't know if I would quit
But I doubt it. I'm,
Taken by the thought of it..(mmm mm)
And I know this much is true (mmmmm)
Baby, you have become my addiction.
I'm so strung out on you (mmmm)
I can barely move...but I like it,
(Chorus)
And, then it's all because of you (all because of you)
So, then it's all because of you (all because of you)
And it's all because of you (all because of you)
So, then it's all because...
Never get enough,
She's the sweetest drug. (Oowuuu)
(Verse 2)
Think of it every second,
I can't get nothing done.
Only concern is the next time, I'm 'gon get me some.
Know I should stay away from,
Cause it's no good for me.
I try and try but my obsession, won't let me leave.
(Hook #1)
I've got a problem and I (don't know what to do about it)
Even if I did I don't know if I would quit
But I doubt it. I'm,
Taken by the thought of it. (mmmm) (heeyh..)
And I know this much is true, (mmmm)
Baby, you have become my addiction.
I'm so strung out on you, (strung out on you..)
I can barely move...but I like it, (but I like it..)
(Chorus)
And, then it's all because of you (all because of you) (aey!)
So, then it's all because of you (all because of you)
And it's all because of you (all because of you)
So, then it's all because...
Never get enough (Never get enough..)
She's the sweetest drug.
(Hook #2)
Ain't no doubt.... (no doubt heayh)
So strung out. (Strung out heeayh)
Ain't no doubt....
So strung out. (heahheh!)
Over you,
Over you,(yooouuu)
Over you(yooouuu)...
(Harmonics)
(Mmouhh)
(Because of you)
(And it's all because of you)
(mm)
(Never get enough)
(She's the sweetest drug)
And I know this much is true (Truuuuue)
Baby, you (baby yoou you you you) have become my addiction (become my addiction)
I'm so strung out on you,
I can barely move...but I like it (and I like it..yeaheh..)
(Chorus)
And, then it's all because of you (aey!)(all because of you)
So, then it's all because of you (all because of you)
And it's all because of you (all because of you)
So, then it's all because...
Never get enough (Oooh never get enough)
She's the sweetest drug,
...She's the sweetest drug...
