<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Over_My_Head">
[Verse 1]
So I had someone
You had someone
Started out as nothing more than friends,
But as the time got spent
I started liking spending time with you
More than him
And it wasn't what I meant to do
Started thinking about kissing you
Accidentally
Accidentally
Suddenly out of the blue
Guess you was thinking about it too
Cause you kissed me
And he saw you 
Damn
Damn
I might be over my head,
A little over my head,
But I kinda like it,
I kinda like it
This is not what I expected
A little over my head
But I kinda like it
I kinda like it
Said, I kinda like it.
So of course he started acting crazy
Wound up punching you right in the eye.
He felt like a man,
But I felt bad,
So I called you later,
To apologize.
And it wasn't what I meant to do
Started thinking about seeing you
Accidentally,
Accidentally,
Suddenly out of the blue,
Guess you was thinking about it too
Cause you came to get me,
And he saw you.
Damn
Damn
Damn
Damn.
[Chorus]
I might be over my head
A little over my head
But I kinda like it
I kinda like it
This is not what I expected
A little over my head
But I kinda like it
I kinda like it
This is so crazy
Yet so hard,
They're fighting over me,
In the front yard.
I don't know who I should root for,
But there's one thing I do know....
I might be over my head
A little over my head
But I kinda like it
I kinda like it
This is not what I expected
A little over my head
But I kinda like it
I kinda like it
I might be over my head
A little over my head
But I kinda like it
I kinda like it
This is not what I expected
A little over my head
But I kinda like it
I kinda like it
