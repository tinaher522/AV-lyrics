<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Tear_You_Down">
Verse 1
Now ive been known to sweat out a good weave or two in my time
A multiple amount of head boards cracked in half put a hurting on many of dimes
Ive scarred up lots of knees with carpet burn hot candle wax the whole 9
Blind folds and handcuffs my regular MO for sure i be a full time freak with mine
Real talk
Pre-Chorus
Sugar i dont have a problem with given u a little demonstration right quick
Lay back let me start it off with a kiss to the lips in between your hips
Follow me now straight to the bed oh no truthfully i like it on the kitchen floor
Is you ready babe
Slow song keep your thong on slide it to the side and signal me home girl 
Chorus
Get ready babe cuz im gonna tear you down, 
Wanna hear you scream my name til the neighbors hear the sound
Talking bout sex so good i guarentee you wont wanna go home
So get ready babe cuz im gonna tear you down
Verse
You gon need about a hour girl to re-adjust before u try to get up
And dont worry bout your legs baby they'll stop shakin soon enough
Hate to sound conceited but i dont think you kno your messin with a true professional
Put your legs in the air. pull your hair girl this aint no nice and slowwww
Pre-Chorus
Sugar i dont have a problem with given u a little demonstration right quick
Lay back let me start it off with a kiss to the lips in between your hips
Follow me now straight to the bed oh no truthfully i like it on the kitchen floor
Is you ready babe
Slow song keep your thong on slide it to the side and signal me home girl 
Chorus
Get ready babe cuz im gonna tear you down, 
Wanna hear you scream my name til the neighbors hear the sound
Talking bout sex so good i guarentee you wont wanna go home
So get ready babe cuz im gonna tear you down (tear you down)
Instrumental
(fade out)Get ready babe cuz im gonna tear you down, 
Wanna hear you scream my name til the neighbors hear the sound
Talking bout sex so good i guarentee you wont wanna go home
So get ready babe cuz im gonna tear you down (tear you down)
