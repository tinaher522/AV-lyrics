<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="She's_A_Problem">
Now we went every night,
I hit the club and find somethin' i like 
Somethin' it looks like it would fit just right 
By my side and in my ride couse i'm the old comin' bachelor 
That means i'm not chasin' after her
But imma get with her afterwords 
She'll be by my side and in my ride couse,
(shes so confendent) shawty got her swagga on
(and i know where her dome is) by the waY she kiss some maggin on,
Shakes off them wanna be never gonna be playin' them  makes her way over to me
CHOURS
She knows (REPEAT) i know
Couse she knew what she was doin' when she put then on her attention was for me to take her home
She knows (REPEAT)
I know she's a mad breaker shall make a nigga work gotta get a jumpin' on the bottom of her skirt
Now when i look at her i gotta keep control 
Couse she makes me wanna get them like (?)
When i look at her we both start to pretendin' 
Like i don't want her and she ain't into me 
But it's a (?) message keep leave in her hips 
Its like my it is a resom right next to her lips 
The way she's movin' i'm gonna slip
Unzip the rock and republics and give her the tip
(shes so confendent) shawty got her swagga on
(and i know where her dome is) couse  the waY she kiss some maggin on,shakes off them 
Wanna be never gonna be playin' them she makes her way over to me 
She knows (REPEAT) i know
Couse she knew what she was doin' when she put then on her attention was for me to take her home
She knows (REPEAT)
I know she's a mad breaker shall make a nigga work gotta have a jumpin' on the bottom of the skirt (x3)
