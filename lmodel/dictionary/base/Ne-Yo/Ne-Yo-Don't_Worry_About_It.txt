<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Don't_Worry_About_It">
Come and dance with me x 2
Oooohhh yeah.
Im feeling good
As the world comes crashing down down down
My smile is tattooed
It means im permanently happy now now now
So many reasons to shed so many tears
That i could drown / mmmm
But i stay high and dry
Floating above the water on this cloud
And i wont come down oh.
Theres always something wrong its just the way it
Goes oh oh oh.
And all that stress will still be there
Tomorrow oh oh so
Im gunna dance like aint nothing wrong tonight
Im gunna dance like aint nothing wrong
Im gunna dance like aint nothing wrong tonight
Im gunna dance like aint nothing wrong
Im feeling good
As the world comes crashing down down down
See i no and that one day my heart will stop
But so long as its pumping now
Im gunna find some other reals that do
Im gunna look em in the eye and say yeah me to
I no that times its hard
I no that life is tough
How about we dance now
And worry when the sun comes up
Theres always something wrong its just the way it
Goes oh oh oh.
And all that stress will still be there
Tomorrow oh oh so
Im gunna dance like aint nothing wrong tonight
Im gunna dance like aint nothing wrong
Im gunna dance like aint nothing wrong tonight
Im gunna dance like aint nothing wrong
Dance like aint nothing wrong tonight
Im gunna dance like aint nothing wrong
Im gunna dance like aint nothing wrong tonight
Im gunna dance like aint nothing wrong
Hey hey
Same life
But you've been waiting all your break Forever
You might aswell have some fun while you wait
Come and dance with me / oohh yeaah
Come and dance with me / ooh
Ooohh
Theres always something wrong its just the way it
Goes oh oh oh.
And all that stress will still be there
Tomorrow oh oh so
Im gunna dance like aint nothing wrong tonight
Im gunna dance like aint nothing wrong
Im gunna dance like aint nothing wrong tonight
Im gunna dance like aint nothing wrong
