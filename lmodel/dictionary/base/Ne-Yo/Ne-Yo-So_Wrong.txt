<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="So_Wrong">
[Verse 1]
I can't believe I fell for you
Actually to tell you the truth
Any man would probably be your fool
Something about the things you do
That makes me melt right in your hands
But watch as I don't understand
I've got a woman 
You've got a man
But we can't control ourselves
[Chorus]
Baby
We both know that it's wrong to cheat
So why do I dream of you all night long
And baby
I'm bad for you
And you're bad for me
So how can something that feels so right
Be so wrong
[Verse 2]
I love you but I know that it's wrong
And I know that before too long
She's gonna discover
What other man I've been cheating on
Feel so guilty I can't even sleep at night
Cuz when my lady is holding me tight
I'm picturing your face
And baby how your love is so right
I don't know what to do
[Chorus]
Baby
We both know that it's wrong to cheat
So why do I dream of you all night long
And baby
I'm bad for you
And you're bad for me
So how can something that feels so right
Be so wrong
[Verse 3]
I just gotta see you 
I'm beating on your door baby
Come on
Let me in
We both know
That this ain't right
But we don't care
I don't care baby
That I don't care
[Chorus x2]
Baby 
We both know that it's wrong to cheat
So why do I dream of you all night long
And baby
I'm bad for you
And you're bad for me
So how can something that feels so right
Be so wrong
Baby 
We both know that it's wrong to cheat
So why do I dream of you all night long
And baby
I'm bad for you
And you're bad for me
So how can something that feels so right
Be so wrong
