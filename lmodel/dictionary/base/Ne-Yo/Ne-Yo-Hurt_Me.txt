<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Hurt_Me">
On a mission to make me feel it
All she wanna do is hurt me
Shorty's only concern is that I fall
Naa
She's determined to kill me softly
And I think she knows it's working
But what's sad is that I deserve it all
Then I brought her life to an end
And now all she wants is revenge
All she wanna do is hurt me
Make me play her game
All she wanna do is hurt me
She wants me to feel pain
I tried to say I'm sorry
But that don't mean a thing
All she wanna do is hurt me
All she wanna do is hurt me, yeah
I'm running round in circles lately
I don't really know my way now
Trying to figure it out but it's no use
And I feel like it's almost over
It could happen any day now
She's taken everything but my life and she wants that too, oh
'Cause I brought her life to an end
And now all she wants is revenge
All she wanna do is hurt me
Make me play her game
All she wanna do is hurt me
She wants me to fell pain
I tried to say I'm sorry, so sorry
But that don't mean a thing
All she wanna do is hurt me
All she wanna do is hurt me, yeah
I didn't mean to do what I did
I didn't know that this would happen
And if I never, ever love again
It'll be exactly what she wanted from me
Cold Blooded
Oh
Cold Hearted
Oh
We never started
Oh
[...]
Oh
Ah, oh
All she wanna do is hurt me, hurt me yeah
Make me play her game, oh all she wanna do
All she wanna do is hurt me, oh hurt me
She wants me to feel pain
She wants me to feel pain
I tried to say I'm sorry, said I'm sorry
But that don't mean a thing, but that don't mean a thing
All she wanna do is hurt me
All she wanna do is hurt me, yeah
