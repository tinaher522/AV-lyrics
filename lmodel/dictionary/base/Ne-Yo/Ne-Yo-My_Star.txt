<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="My_Star">
[Verse 1:]
Had to fall, so i could get up,
Had to die, to be reborn,
Had to win, to find my new beginnning,
I know the way now
[Bridge:]
Close my eyes, to truly see you,
Tune out the world, to cleary hear,
Force the star, to find the strength to start this new day,
You light my way
[Chorus:]
When i look up in the sky, you're so beautiful, shining
And if ever i'm in loss want you there to, shine me the way
When i look up in the sky you're so beautiful, shining
You are my star (you're my star)
[Verse 2:]
I feel your warmth, so i can hug you
I feel your smile, though i can't see your face
I think of you and i feel so protected
I know the way now
[Bridge:]
I close my eyes, to truly see you,
Tune out the world, to clearly hear,
Force the star, to find the strength to start this new day,
You light my way
[Chorus:]
When i look up in the sky, you're so beautiful, shining
And if ever i'm in loss want you there to, shine me the way
When i look up in the sky you're so beautiful, shining
You are my star (you're my star)
[Verse 3:]
Never knew that losing you would be,
The thing that would help me find me,
But i know you're smiling down on me,
Constantly
[Chorus:]
Oh, when i look up in the sky, you're so beautiful, shining
And if ever i'm in loss want you there to, shine me the way
When i look up in the sky you're so beautiful, shining
You are, you are, you are my star, oh
When i look up in the sky, you're so beautiful, shining
And if ever i'm in lust want you there to, shine me the way
When i look up in the sky you're so beautiful, shining
You are my star, my star, my star
