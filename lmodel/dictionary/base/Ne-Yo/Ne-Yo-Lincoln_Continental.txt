<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Lincoln_Continental">
Taking a ride
No place I gotta be but
Even if I did
I really wouldn't care
Shut up and drive
I don't mean to be mean
But your conversation
Would just contaminate my air
On a whole other planet today
We need no other population
So be prepared to be turned away
If you're attempting hesitation
And if anyone asks
If anybody's looking for me
I said if anyone asks
You can tell them this is where I'll be
In the Lincoln Continental
In the back seat all alone
And I just don't feel like talking
That's why I've got the glasses on
I just don't want to be bothered
Not today not today not today not today no. no, no
I just don't want to be bothered
Not today not today not today not today no. no, no
Spare me the question
Don't strain yourself
Trying to make me think
You care if I'm okay
None of your concern
If this has anything to do
With the fact
She left a year ago today
And if anyone asks
If anybody's looking for me
I said if anyone asks
You can tell them this is where I'll be
In the Lincoln Continental
In the back seat all alone
And I just don't feel like talking
That's why I've got the glasses on
I just don't want to be bothered
Not today not today not today not today no. no, no
I just don't want to be bothered
Not today not today not today not today no. no, no
I'm ignoring the world
Just for a little while
I know it may seem strange
?Cos normally this ain't my style
But just for today
I'm gonna spend a little time with misery
So if you're looking for me
Baby, this is where I'll be
Fighting back the tears
In the Lincoln Continental
In the back seat all alone
And I just don't feel like talking
That's why I've got the glasses on
I just don't want to be bothered
Not today not today not today not today no. no, no
I just don't want to be bothered
Not today not today not today not today no. no, no
In the Lincoln Continental
In the back seat all alone
And I just don't feel like talking
That's why I've got the glasses on
I just don't want to be bothered
Not today not today not today not today no. no, no
I just don't want to be bothered
Not today not today not today not today no. no, no
In the Lincoln Continental
