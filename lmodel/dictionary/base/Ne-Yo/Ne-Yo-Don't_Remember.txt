<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Don't_Remember">
What did I say to her last night,
I can't feel my face,
Tryna focus, but my mind ain't right.
I remember that party,
The dj,
My homies,
My girl and me.
But the rest of is blurry,
Cause something I did made my girl just go away.
Got the same clothes on today, that I had on yesterday.
What did I do or what I say,
Man I don't remember
I guess I had too much to drink
Cause I don't remember.
Ohh my car ain't outside
How the hell did I get home.
Damn.
Did she drive me, dropped me off, grabbed her stuff and got gone.
I can't call my homies,
Cause I'm looking but I just can't find my phone
I need to talk to somebody.
Cause something I did made my girl just go away.
Got the same clothes on today, that I had on yesterday.
What did I do or what I say,
Man I don't remember
I guess I had too much to drink
Cause I don't remember.
Damn
Is she gone forever
Man I don't know, I just don't remember.
