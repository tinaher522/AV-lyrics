<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Breaking_Up">
[Verse 1]
Cold in this room now
Cuz you left me
Here by myself
Used to make love here
Now this place feels
Like a prison cell
So many questions
That we won't answered
Not today
(Not today)
You scream at me
I scream at you
And we communicate
This way
[Chorus]
We're breaking up (Oh)
We're breaking up (Oh)
We're breaking up
(I think it's safe to say it's over)
We're breaking up (Oh)
We're breaking up (Oh)
We're breaking up
(Please don't say it's over)
[Verse 2]
I want to touch you
Your body heat to me
Is Vegas sun
But I won't give in
Because if I do
That means you've won
Pride is a leash
I don't know
What I'm wearing it for
Why do I do?
This is a game in which
Both of us are keeping score
Still, we both lose
We're fools
[Chorus x2]
We're breaking up (Oh)
We're breaking up (Oh)
We're breaking up
(I think it's safe to say it's over)
We're breaking up (Oh)
We're breaking up (Oh)
We're breaking up
(Please don't say it's over)
We're breaking up (Oh)
We're breaking up (Oh)
We're breaking up
(I think it's safe to say it's over)
We're breaking up (Oh)
We're breaking up (Oh)
We're breaking up
(Please don't say it's over)
[Verse 3]
Don't say it's over
Don't say it's over
Please don't' say it's over
(Hey, don't say it's over)
Don't say it's over
Don't say it's over
Please don't' say it's over
(Baby, please don't you say it's over)
Baby please don't say it
[Chorus x2]
We're breaking up (Oh)
We're breaking up (Oh)
We're breaking up
(I think it's safe to say it's over)
We're breaking up (Oh)
We're breaking up (Oh)
We're breaking up
(Please don't say it's over)
We're breaking up (Oh)
We're breaking up (Oh)
We're breaking up
(I think it's safe to say it's over)
We're breaking up (Oh)
We're breaking up (Oh)
We're breaking up
(Please don't say it's over)
