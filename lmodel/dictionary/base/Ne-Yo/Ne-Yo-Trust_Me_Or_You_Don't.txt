<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Trust_Me_Or_You_Don't">
Picture me confused
What the hell did i do
She says you know what you did
And honestly, i don't have a clue
(here we go again)
Fuss and arguin
(soon as i come in)
She start up with
Where the hell you been
(where the hell you been)
I know what this is
(she's caught up with)
One of our little friends, in her ear
And once again we're here
It's time to make things clear
Cuz i can't take it
Either trust me or you don't
Girl make up your mind
Either trust me or you don't
Girl, we're just wastin time
Either trust me or you
Stop lying to yourself &amp; me
Trying to hold on
But girl I'm almost gone
Either trust me or you don't
I've been true
(sure I've done things in my past)
But never to you
(trying to make this one last)
Tired of proving things to you
That girl by now,
I shouldn't have to prove
(here we go again)
Fuss and arguin
(soon as i come in)
She start up with
Where the hell you been
(where the hell you been)
I know what this is
(she's caught up with)
One of our little friends, in her ear
And once again we're here
It's time to make things clear
Cuz i can't take it
Either trust me or you don't
Girl make up your mind (your mind)
Either trust me or you don't
Girl, we're just wastin time
(we're just wastin time)
Either trust me or you
Stop lying to yourself &amp; me
Trying to hold on (trying to hold on)
But girl I'm almost gone
Either trust me or you don't
And i try my best
Not to bring it to this
But my patience is all gone
(don't wanna move on)
But I've done nothing wrong
(I've done nothing wrong)
I'ma keep it real, even if you won't
Either trust me or you don't
Girl make up your mind
Either trust me or you don't
(you don't, you don't)
Girl, we're just wastin time
Either trust me or you
Stop lying to yourself &amp; me (yourself &amp; me)
Trying to hold on (trying to hold on)
But girl I'm almost gone
Either trust me or you don't
Either trust me or you don't
Either trust me or you don't
Trust me or you don't
