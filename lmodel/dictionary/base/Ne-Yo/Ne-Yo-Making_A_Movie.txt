<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Making_A_Movie">
Ladies and gentleman
We are officially larger than life
The stage is set
The lights are on
And this is where the magic happens
So without further a do
Our feature presentation
[Verse 1]
I think I need a moment with you
Said no need to audition
You're beautiful
So tell me what you're drinking
Baby let me know
You don't gotta pay for another one of those tonight
Baby I'm something like a big deal
Somebody you're pleased to know
[Pre-Chorus]
And you should get to know me
Flyest in the room without trying to be
Dressed to the nice
Swag genuine
So special
So rare
Never hard to find
You setting it off
Know I'm kinda cocky
But smiling I'm the boss
I mean it ain't just talk
I'm a winner 
So I ain't never lost
[Chorus]
So come here girl
We're making a movie
So come and be my little lady girl
Tell me what you're drinking
Baby let me know
You ain't gotta pay for another one of those
We're making a movie
And the director is me
So when I yell cut we gonna leave
[Verse 2]
I think I need a love scene with you
So come and be my little lady girl 
See me and you tonight would be beautiful
Talk about it later 
Baby girl for now
Finish up your drink
Got more bottles coming out tonight
See it's all about presentation
Baby I put on a show
[Pre-Chorus]
And you should get to know me
Flyest in the room without trying to be
Dressed to the nice
Swag genuine
So special
So rare
Never hard to find
You setting it off
Know I'm kinda cocky
But smiling I'm the boss
I mean it ain't just talk
I'm a winner 
So I ain't never lost
[Chorus]
So come here girl
We're making a movie
So come and be my little lady girl
Tell me what you're drinking
Baby let me know
You ain't gotta pay for another one of those
We're making a movie
And the director is me
So when I yell cut we gonna leave
[Verse 3]
Stage is set 
And the lights are on
Lights camera action baby
Give it up til the last bottle's gone
Til the sight of dawn babe
We gonna party 
So baby come on
[Chorus]
So come here girl
We're making a movie
So come and be my little lady girl
Tell me what you're drinking
Baby let me know
You ain't gotta pay for another one of those
We're making a movie
And the director is me
So when I yell cut we gonna leave
So come and be my little lady girl
Tell me what you're drinking
Baby let me know
You ain't gotta pay for another one of those
We're making a movie
And the director is me
So when I yell cut we gonna leave
