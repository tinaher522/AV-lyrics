<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="A_Little_Space">
You swallowed my face
When you kissed me today
It was sweet but okay
That's a little much
And when we walk down the street
Youll be right under me
I cant move two feet without your touch
Ungrateful, oh no i am not
Most women would give to have what i got (i know)
All i'm saying is that sometimes baby
There's nothing wrong with giving me a little room to breathe
Baby i just need a little space
A little break
From you today
Now i don't want you to go away
But just for today
Go over there
Oh, could you go over there
Oh oh oh, could you go over there
When im getting ready
To go out with my peeps
You be looking at me
Like can i come too
Baby where are your friends
Aren't they off watching
Football or something
And waiting for you
Ungreatful, oh no i am not
Most women would to have what i got (i know)
All im saying is that sometimes baby
Theres nothing wrong with giving me a little room to breathe
Baby i just need a little space
A little break
From you today
Now i dont want you to go away
But just for today
Go over there
Oh, could you go over there
Oh oh oh, could you go over there
Just back up off of me
I'm not tryna be mean
But could you give me fifty feet
Only for a little while
I know you love to be by my side
And that's fine
But every once in a while
Take your space and give me mine
Baby i just need a little space
A little break
From you today
Now i don't want you to go away
But just for today
Go over there
Baby i just need a little space
A little break
From you today
Now i don't want you to go away
But just for today
Go over there
Oh, could you go over there
Oh oh oh, could you go over there
