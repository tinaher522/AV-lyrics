<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Yo_New_Man">
F*ck that nigga
Whoa
I'm sorry, let me calm down
Quit trippin' let me breathe
Ok, I'm alright now
She got a whole lot of nerve, walk past me without sayin' a word
Cat on her arm, look like a nerd
Tell me that aint your new man
Chorus
So that ya new boyfriend?
I'm truthfully not impressed
I see that ya had to, settle for second best
So that ya new boyfriend?
Better tell him to quit steppin'
'cause I'd hate to have to, hurt, your new man
She walkin' through the club with this cat, gossin' to all her friends
Got her drinkin on dope crystal and, guess the nigga got ends
Now I don't mind her findin someone else, no that aint the case
But she came to the club knowin' I was gonna be here so she could front that nigga in my face
That shit aint right!
Yeah yeah yeah
So they pulled up to the spot in a convertible seven fourty five
Yeah yeah yeah
That nigga like eight feet tall, and I'm chillin' at about five nine
Yeah yeah yeah
Black credit card with no limit and I'm knowin' he be hittin it
So what?
If I really wanted that
I'm bettin' I could get it back
Chorus
So that ya new boyfriend?
I'm truthfully not impressed
I see that ya had to, settle for second best
So that ya new boyfriend?
Better tell him to quit steppin'
'cause I'd hate to have to, hurt, your new man
.. they walkin' hand-in-hand
She got a brand new man, understand, I'm really not givin' a damn
But she, got him walkin' dressin' like me
And if I had the chance most likely, I would whoop his ass discretely
Case of jealousy
Chorus
So that ya new boyfriend?
I'm truthfully not impressed
I see that ya had to, settle for second best
So that ya new boyfriend?
Better tell him to quit steppin'
'cause I'd hate to have to, hurt, your new man
So that ya new boyfriend?
I'm truthfully not impressed
I see that ya had to, settle for second best
So that ya new boyfriend?
Better tell him to quit steppin'
'cause I'd hate to have to, hurt, your new man
