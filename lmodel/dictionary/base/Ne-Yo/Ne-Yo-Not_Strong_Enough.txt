<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Not_Strong_Enough">
First let me say, I know it's late
Girl I could tell you were sleeping
So sorry to wake you,
But what Imma say to you tonight girl it just couldn't wait
No, not one more day
No, not one more hour
We've been apart for some time
You went your way i went mine
My manhood wont let me cry
But to act like im alright
It's something I just cant do
Keep pretending that I'm okay without you
I said its something I just cant do
What if i could im just not strong enough to
Not strong enough to
Keep lying to you
No I'm not strong enough to
I can see, you looking at me
You're thinking too little too late
Cause it was me
That said that we shouldn't be
But that was before I could think straight
My pride it made me lie
To you and to myself about waht I need
So now I, walk around with this lie
Truly dying inside, acting like im just fine
Its something I just cant do
Keep pretendeing that im okay without you
I said its something i just cant do
What if i could im just not strong enought to
No I'm not strong enough to
Keep lying to you
I'm not strong enough to
Said I'm trying to be honest
I'm making you a promise
Im gonna be true to you
Cause me tryin to be not
Then without you I would die
Something I just can no longer do
Said I'm trying to be honest
I'm making you a promise
I'm gonna be true to you
Because me tryin to be not
Then without you I would die
Something I just can no longer do
