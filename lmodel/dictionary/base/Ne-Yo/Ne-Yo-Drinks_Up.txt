Gentleman!

The answer and the question bein'
Who's the flyest in the spot this evenin'

Dont mean to interrupt your flow
But i

In the words of andre 3000 right
If u aint the one u the prototype
I'm a go getta gettin my fly young man on
Lean like a pimp but i do stand on
My own two, grown too, and in good health
And i can do badd by myself; so wuttup?
So wuttup ma where you at with yours?
Do u gently knock, do u kick down doors?
If so baby girl maybe we could ride
Kick a few down side by side, whut u say mama?

All my chicks that make moves

Shes a rose amongst the weeds
A diamond amongst the seas (seas)

I'm a go getta gettin my fly young man on 
Lean like a pimp but i do stand on

And i can do badd by myself; so wuttup? 
So wuttup ma where you at with yours? 
Do u gently knock, do u kick down doors? 
If so baby girl maybe we could ride 
Kick a few down side by side, whut u say mama?

All my chicks that make moves 
Put ur drinks up this one is for u
