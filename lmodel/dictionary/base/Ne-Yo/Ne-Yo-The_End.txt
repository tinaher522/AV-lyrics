<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="The_End">
[Verse 1]
Close your eyes
Until you can picture this
Two people
Sharing a passionate kiss
One of love's most common tokens
But baby's kissing with her eyes wide open
Tell me what does it mean
When the one you love don't talk no more
No more going out to eat
Or romantic moonlit walks no more
No more making love from night to day
And when you look at her face
The only thing that you can say
[Chorus]
Time's flies
When you're in love
Never telling she's
How long it takes for love to be
Over and gone
You just never know
It's like you're covering your eyes up
Nobody ever tells you
What to be like 
When the end comes around
When the end comes around
[Verse 2]
Now you're sitting all alone
Trying to figure out 
Where it is that you went wrong
The time she wanted to go to the beach
Coming home late every night
You gone and stole her joy
And if she can't be happy
Then why would she waste her time
To her feelings you were blind
As just that fast
Love is left behind
[Chorus]
Time's flies
When you're in love
Never telling she's
How long it takes for love to be
Over and gone
You just never know
It's like you're covering your eyes up
Nobody ever tells you
What to be like 
When the end comes around
When the end comes around
[Verse 3]
The bad times
I wave at good times
You don't wanna believe 
That the love you swore would never leave
Now you hardly receive
Now it's yelling 
And crying
And threats to leave
When it seems only yesterday 
We were so much in love
How could this be
[Chorus x2]
Time's flies
When you're in love
Never telling she's
How long it takes for love to be
Over and gone
You just never know
It's like you're covering your eyes up
Nobody ever tells you
What to be like 
When the end comes around
When the end comes around
Time's flies
When you're in love
Never telling she's
How long it takes for love to be
Over and gone
You just never know
It's like you're covering your eyes up
Nobody ever tells you
What to be like 
When the end comes around
When the end comes around
