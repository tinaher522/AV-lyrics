<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="You_Want_It">
Only satisfied, what you want tonight?
None of these guys, this room think your fly, that we much too shy.
Then we catch eyes from across the room.
Suddenly it's oh no! oh no! 
Hey, she looking at me like, something that ain't right. 
Oh no! oh no!
Baby. I ain't no tree,
You wanna say this stuff to me.
Girl let me know, know, you wanted something.
Girl I ain't running, hey I'm right here if you waving to the flow.
Come show me something, girl i aint running.
You want it, go get it babe.
You want come get it, you want come get it, you want it.
Girl i'm right here, so come get what you want.
You want it come get it, you want it come get it, you want it.
Girl I'm right here... 
Stalking me like prey from across the way,
All that I can say, bring it baby.
I don't play no games, but at times I'm dumb.
She'll be nice and tamed, talking bout.
Oh no! oh no!
Hey, she looking at me like, something that ain't right. 
Oh no! oh no!
Baby. I ain't no tree,
You wanna say this stuff to me.
Girl let me know, know, you wanted something.
Girl I ain't running, hey I'm right here if you waving to the flow... to the flow
Come show me something, girl i aint running.
You want it, go get it babe.
You want come get it, you want come get it, you want it.
Girl i'm right here, so come get what you want.
You want it come get it, you want it come get it, you want it.
Girl I'm right here... come get what you want.
Go get it, go get it, get it.
Go get it, go get it, get it.
Go get it, go get it, get it.
Go get it, go get it... girl
Girl let me know, know, you wanted something.
Girl I ain't running, hey I'm right here if you waving to the flow... to the flow
Come show me something, girl i aint running.
You want it, go get it babe.
You want come get it, you want come get it, you want it.
Girl i'm right here, so come get what you want.
You want it come get it, you want it come get it, you want it.
Girl I'm right here... so come get what you want.
