Baby when we first met
It was kind of fly that I couldn't predict your mood
Said I could never guess, no 
And it was the best, so
Not like any other dude
But I don't know man, I don't know man, I don't know man
I don't really, really know
But before my eyes I saw the good you leave
And the bad you start to show
And I just can't take it, I can't take it
No I just can't take it, No
So we ain't gon make it, Ain't gon make it
This is relationship ain't gon make it, no
I'm tired of all this..
Round and Round we go
You can't decide if you wanna be trife or treat me right
So round &amp; round we go
While I decided don't wanna ride anymore
I'm sick and tired of you taking me Round &amp; Round &amp; Round
Round &amp; Round we go
I'm sick and tired of you taking me Round &amp; Round &amp; Round
Round &amp; Round we go, Round &amp; Round we go
Round &amp; Round we go
Don't get excited anymore when you're sweet to me
Because I know one, two, three minutes later
You'll be right back to being mean
It's flowers on a Monday, Tuesday you're hating me
Wednesday's makeup sex is so amazing
What will you be Thursday, will it be friendly
Or will you be like you've been sleeping with the enemy
Thought So
Round and Round we go
You can't decide if you wanna be trife or treat me right
So round &amp; round we go
While I decided don't wanna ride anymore
I'm sick and tired of you taking me Round &amp; Round &amp; Round
Round &amp; Round we go
I'm sick and tired of you taking me Round &amp; Round &amp; Round
Round &amp; Round we go, Round &amp; Round we go
Look at me, look at me, baby i'm so damn dizzy
Tryina keep, tryina keep, trying to keep up with you
Baby you're Doctor Jekyll and Mister Hyde
Slowly ruining my life for me
Baby I don't need you
Round and Round we go, Round &amp; Round we go
Round and Round we go
You can't decide if you wanna be trife or treat me right
So round &amp; round we go
While I decided don't wanna ride anymore
I'm sick and tired of you taking me Round &amp; Round &amp; Round
Round &amp; Round we go
I'm sick and tired of you taking me Round &amp; Round &amp; Round 
Round &amp; Round we go, Round &amp; Round we go
I'm sick and tired of you taking me Round &amp; Round &amp; Round
Round &amp; Round we go
I'm sick and tired of you taking me Round &amp; Round &amp; Round
Round &amp; Round we go, Round &amp; Round we go
Round &amp; Round we go
