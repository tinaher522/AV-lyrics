<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Can't_Stop">
Ohhhhhhh
Verse 1:
Put your pictures away
Anything that might bring up
Memories of the days
And the nights we spent in love
You were my favourite song
Baby tell me why we had to turn the radio off (Oh)
Hook:
Girl I ain't trippin on you
I'm just fine (I'm just fine)
You hardly ever even cross my mind (Even though)
Even though a blind man could look in my face
And just know that that's a lie
I'm barely treading water
Saying I'm alright
Chorus:
Cuz I can't stop crying
And I can't stop asking why
But I can't stop lying
And if you ask me I'll deny
That I can't stop crying
On the outside I'm alright
But I'm dieing on the inside
Verse 2:
Saw you out yesterday
And I know that you saw me
You was with your new man
And I was with some random piece
Suddenly we caught eyes
Then I looked away
Before it got too hard to breathe (Oh)
Hook:
Girl I ain't trippin on you
I'm just fine (I'm just fine)
You hardly ever even cross my mind (Even cross my mind)
Even though a blind man could look in my face (Oh)
And just know that that's a lie
I'm barely treading water
Saying I'm alright
Chorus:
Cuz I can't stop crying (Can't stop crying)
And I can't stop asking why (Oh why)
But I can't stop lying
And if you ask me I'll deny (I'll deny)
That I can't stop crying
On the outside I'm alright (Alright, alright)
But I'm dieing on the inside (Oh)
Cuz I can't stop crying (Can't stop crying)
And I can't stop asking why (Askin why)
But I can't stop lying
And if you ask me I'll deny (I'll deny)
That I can't stop crying (Oh)
On the outside I'm alright (I'm alright)
But I'm dieing on the inside (Hey)
Hook:
Girl I ain't trippin on you
I'm just fine (I don't even think about you babe, babe oh)
Even though a blind man could look in my face
And just know that that's a lie
I'm barely treading water
Saying I'm alright
Chorus:
Cuz I can't stop crying (Hey)
And I can't stop asking why (Can't stop askin why)
But I can't stop lying (Oh)
And if you ask me I'll deny (Ask me I'll deny)
That I can't stop crying (Oh no)
On the outside I'm alright (Really I'm alright)
But I'm dieing on the inside (But I'm dieing on the inside)
Oh oh, I'm dieing
Girl you're killing me (oh)
Dieing on the inside
Dieing on the inside
Killing me, Killing me babe
