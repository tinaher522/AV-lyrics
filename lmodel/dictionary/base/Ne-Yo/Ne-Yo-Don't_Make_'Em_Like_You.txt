<song artist="Ne-Yo" title="Don't_Make_'Em_Like_You">
Clap for her, clap for her
'Cause they don't make 'em like her no more
Clap for her, clap for her
'Cause they don't make 'em like you, no
Shawty not the regular in all this
Tell me what you call it
When a chick don't make decision
Based on a dude's wallet
She ain't in the club
Acting like an alcoholic
She's a pretty girl, tipsy
No stumbling and falling
If she leave the club with me
Then her maturity
Gonna make sure
She follow me in her car
She's so responsible, she gone make sure
She leave in time to get home
Get ready for work or get ready for class
Because shawty major
It's business and accounting
Know her mama proud of her
So for my little mama, anti-drama
So in celebration of you
Shawty, I'ma raise a glass
Here's a toast to the ladies with class
I see you, babe, saying, hey-ey-ey
I love the way she make, girl, the way you are
'Cause they don't make like you no more
Baby girl, keep doing, you how you do
I love the way you move, they don't make 'em like you
Girl, they don't make like you no more
She a diva, take a second to turn you into a believer
She a viva, in the middle of the July
12 noon in Las Vegas that mean shawty on fire
She know what she want
Not afraid to get it, not afraid to have fun
Baby, you the one, few and far between
Sexy as they come, swag so mean
I'ma raise a glass
Here's a toast to my ladies with class
Saying, hey-ey-ey, I love the way she make
Baby, I love the way you are
'Cause they don't make like you no more
Baby girl, keep doing, you how you do
I love the way you move
They don't make 'em like you
Girl, they don't make like you no more
Clap for her, clap for her
They don't make 'em like her no more
Clap for her, clap for her
'Cause they don't make 'em like you, no
Top notch, top floor, 4-54, fully restored
Nice wheels, red bottoms galore
Been honest they don't make 'em like you anymore
We the hottest in my whip, give me the promise
We'll be dancing with the stars
And throwing peace signs at the comets
We'll be posing for the cameras
When they bring us on the carpet
Eating breakfast in the morning
While we reading all the comments
Like, "Ooh girl", "Aww man", "Y'all see her?"
Got me like I'ma spend my whole life with you
And make the perfect wife out you
And now the mother of my kids
Oh, everybody raise a glass
Here's a toast to my ladies with class
Saying, hey-ey-ey
I love the way she make
Oh, I love the way you are
'Cause they don't make like you no more
Saying, hey-ey-ey
I love the way she make
Said, I love the way you are
They don't make like you no more
Baby girl, keep doing, you how you do
I love the way you move
They don't make 'em like you
Girl, they don't make like you no more
Clap for her, clap for her
'Cause they don't make 'em like you no more
Clap for her, clap for her
'Cause they don't make 'em like you no more
