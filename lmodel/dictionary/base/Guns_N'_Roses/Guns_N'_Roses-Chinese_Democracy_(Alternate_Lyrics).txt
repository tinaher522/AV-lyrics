It don't really matter
You will find out for yourself
No, it don't really matter
You're gonna leave this thing to somebody else.
If they where missionaires
Real time visionaires
Sitting in a chinese stew
To view my dis-in-fat-uation
I know that I'm a classic case
Watch my disenchanted face
Blame it on the Falun Gong
They've seen the end and you can't hold on.
Cause it would take a lot more hate than you
To stop the fascination
Bigger than an iron fist
Our baby got to rule the nation
But all I got is precious time.
It don't really matter
You're gonna find out for yourself
No, it don't really matter
So you can hear now from
Somebody else.
Cause it would take a lot more time than you
I've got more masturbation
Even with your iron fist
More than you got to rule the nation
What I got is precious time
More than you got to rule the nation
But all I got is precious time.
It don't really matter
Gonna keep it to myself
No it don't really matter
So you can hear it now from
Somebody else.
You think you got it all locked up inside
And if you beat them all up they'll die
Been like a walk in the park for myself
And now you're keepin' your own kind in hell
And if your Great Wall rocks, blame yourself
While they all reach out for your help
And I'm outta time.
