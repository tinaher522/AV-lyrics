<song artist="Guns_N'_Roses" title="Shadow_Of_Your_Love">
Took my chances carelessly
choked on my own cigarette
You can hand me another bottle of whiskey baby
but you aint seen the worst yet
Now I'm reckless, gonna have some fun
and the woman who is dead
who was out alnight, no I'm not the only one
And I ain't standing, never standing
in the shadow of your love
shadow of your love
shadow of your love
shadow of your love
Wrote my changes helplessly
yeah but I got no regrets
Money it was on the table
so I booked with all the bets
Living like a lemon aint so hot
and you aint my idea
of one high-rollin' shot
No I ain't standing, never standing
Big dark clouds hanging over your head
hope you've heard, baby all I've said
You've been told, what I've said
No use crying, you're as good as dead
Now I'm reckless, gonna have some fun
and the woman who is dead, who is out alright
now I'm not the only one
And I ain't standing, never standing
