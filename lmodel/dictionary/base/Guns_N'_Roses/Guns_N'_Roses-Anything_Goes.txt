<song artist="Guns_N'_Roses" title="Anything_Goes">
I been thinkin' bout, thinkin' bout sex
Always hungry for somethin' that I haven't had yet
Well, maybe baby you got somethin' to lose
Well, I got somethin', I got somethin' for you
My way, your way, anything goes tonight
My way, your way, anything goes to-
Ooh, panties 'round your knees with your ass in the breeze
Doin' that grind with a push and squeeze
Tied up, tied down, up against the wall
Be my Rubbermaid baby and we can do it all
My way, your way, anything goes tonight
My way, your way, anything goes tonight, yeah
My way, your way, anything goes tonight
My way, your way, anything goes tonight, yeah
Oh, my way, your way, anything goes tonight
My way, your way, anything goes tonight, oh yeah
My way, your way, anything goes tonight, yeah
My way, your way, anything goes to-
Oh, my way, your way, anything goes tonight
Tonight
Tonight, tonight
Anything goes tonight
Woah, woah, uh, oh, woah
Say anything goes tonight
