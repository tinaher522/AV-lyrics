<song artist="Guns_N'_Roses" title="Sail_Away_Sweet_Sister">
Sail away sweet sister
Sail across the sea
Maybe you'll find somebody
That will love you half as much as me
My heart is always with you
No matter what you do
So sail away sweet sister
Cause I'll always be in love with you
But let her be somebody else's queen
I don't want to know about you
Cuz too many others know what I mean
And that's why I got to live without you
I'm in love with a girl
Been talkin' about
I'm in love with a girl
That I can't live without
I'm in love but it feels like
I'm livin' it out
I'm in love but I think I picked a Bad Time
To be in love
