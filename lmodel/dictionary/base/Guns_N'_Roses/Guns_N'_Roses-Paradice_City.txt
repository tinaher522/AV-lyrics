<song artist="Guns_N'_Roses" title="Paradice_City">
Take me down to the paradise city
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Oh, won't you please take me home
Just a' urchin livin' under the street
I'm a hard case that's tough to beat
I'm your charity case so buy me somethin' to eat
I'll pay you at another time take it to the end of the line
Ragz to richez or so they say
Ya gotta keep pushin' for the fortune and fame
It's all a gamble when it's just a game
Ya treat it like a capital crime, everybody's doin' their time
Take me down to the paradise city
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Take me home
Strapped in the chair of the city's gas chamber
Why I'm here I can't quite remember the surgeon general says
It's hazardous to breathe, I'd have another cigarette
But I can't see, tell me who you're gonna believe
Take me down to the paradise city
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Take me home
So far away, so far away
So far away, so far away
Captain America's been torn apart
Now he's a court jester with a broken heart
He said, "Turn me around and take me back
To the start, I must be losin' my mind, are you blind?"
I've seen it all a million times
Take me down to the paradise city
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Take me home
