<song artist="Guns_N'_Roses" title="Hair_Of_The_Dog">
Give me a little bit of volume on this
Heart-breaker, soul shaker
I've been told about you
Steamroller, midnight stroller
What they been saying must be true
Red hot mama
Velvet charmer
I say time's going to pay your dues
Now you're messing with a, a son of a
Now you're messing with a son of a bitch
Now you're messing with a, a son of a
Now you're messing with a son of a bitch
Talking jivey, poison ivy
You ain't going to cling to me
Man taker, born faker
I ain't so blind I can't see
Red hot mama
Velvet charmer
I say time's going to pay your dues 
Now you're messing with a, a son of a
Now you're messing with a son of a bitch
