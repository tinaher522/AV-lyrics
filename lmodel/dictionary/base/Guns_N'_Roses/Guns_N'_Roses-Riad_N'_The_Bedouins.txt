Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Riad N' The Bedouins
Had a plan and thought they'd win
But I don't give a fuck 'bout them
'Cause I am crazy
Oh, my salvation
All my frustrations
Caught in the lies no one had wove as well
Somewhere in time where only I could tell, ooh
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Riad N' The Bedouins
Say that's a war that you can't win
But I have had enough of them
And who can blame me
Sent down on desert winds
Nomads and barbarians
I won't bend my will to them
You aggravate me
Oh, my salvation
And all my frustrations
Caught in the lies no one had wove as well
Somewhere in time where only I could tell
Oh, my salvation
And all my frustrations
Caught in the lies no one had wove as well
Somewhere in time where only I could tell, ooh
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Oh, my salvation
And all my frustrations
Caught in the lies no one had wove as well
Somewhere in time where only I could tell, oh
Ah, ah
Ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Riad N' The Bedouins
Had a plan and though they'd win
Riad N' The Bedouins
Crossed the line and lost again
