I won't be told anymore
That I've been brought down in this storm, ooh
And left so far out from the shore
That I can't find my way back, my way anymore
Oh no, I won't be told anymore
That I've been brought down in this storm
Ooh, and left so far out from the shore
Oh, that I can't find my way back, my way anymore
No, I, I, I
Forgive them that tear down my soul
Bless them that they might grow old
Oh, and free them so that they may know
That it's never too late
For the many times what seemed like a memory
I searched and found the way you used to lure me in
Oh, I found the ways to know why I had to be
Mired in denial and so afraid, oh
If we ever find this true
That we have the strength to choose
Oh, the freedom or the chains
We held together
..(I'm gonna tell you a story)..
..(stand up for righteousness)..
..(what..)..
..(stand up for justice)..
..(what..)..
..(stand up for truth)..
..(How can a person grow up with all this around them?)..
..(You gotta call on that something..)..
..(where does it come from?)..
..(..that can make a way out of no way!)..
..(All this hatred?)..
..(what we've got here is..)
..(fear!)
..(..that power that can make a way out of no way!)..
..(..failure to communicate)..
..(I tell ya' I've seen the lightning flash, I've heard the thunder roll..)
..(Everybody's acting like we can do anything, and it don't matter what we do)..
..(Maybe we gotta be extra careful because maybe it matters more than we even know.)...
..(Sometimes..)..
..(Hatred isn't something you're born with.)
..(..I feel discouraged)..
..(It gets taught)
..(Sometimes I feel discouraged)..
..(I felt this fear!)..
..(He promised never to leave me!)..
..(Never to leave me alone!)..
..(No never alone! No never alone!)..
..(Let's get something straight, alright?)..
..(He promised never to leave me!)..
..(This whole thing was fucked up!)..
..(never to leave me alone)..
..(All men betray. All lose heart..)..
..(I don't want to lose heart!...I want to believe!)..
..(black men and white men together at the table of brotherhood. I have a dream..)..
..(Free at last! free at last! Thank the lord all mighty, we are free at last!)
Oh, I won't be told anymore (If we ever find this true)
That I've been brought down in this storm (That we have the strength to choose)
And left so far out from the shore (Oh, the freedom or the chains)
That I can't find my way back, my way anymore (We held together)
Oh no, I won't be told anymore (If we ever find this true)
That I've been brought down in this storm (That we have the strength to choose)
And left so far out from the shore (Oh, the freedom or the chains)
That I can't find my way back, my way anymore (We held together)
