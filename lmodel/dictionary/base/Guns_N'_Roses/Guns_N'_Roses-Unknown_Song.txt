<song artist="Guns_N'_Roses" title="Unknown_Song">
Seems Like Forever,
And A Day,
If My Intentions,
Are Misunderstood,
Please Be Kind,
I've Done,
All I Should...
I Won't Ask,
Of You,
What I Would,
Not Do
Oh, I Saw The Damage In You,
My Fortune Had Won the ending You
Why Would They Tell Me To Please Don't Just Laugh, In My Face
When All Of The Reasons They Taugh Us Fall Over Themselves
To Give Way
Ah, Yeah...
Its Not A Question Whether My Heart Is True,
Streamed Line
I Had To Pull Through,
Look For A New Beginning,
On You,
Woah, I Got A Message For You,
Open A Way, Its What I've Got To Do...
Give What You Have, For What You Might Lose       
What Would You Say If I Told You That I'm To Blame
And What Would You Do If I Had To Deny, Your Name
Where Would You Go If I Told You I Love You And Then Walked Away?
Ooh, Yea,
Who Should I Tell If Not For The Ones,
That You Could Not Save,
Ooh, Now,
I Told You When I Found You
If There Was Doubts You
Should Be Careful and unafraid
Now They Surround You
All That Amounts To
Is Love That You've Crippled For Fortune And Fame!
If My Affections
Are Misunderstood
And You, Decide,
I'm Up, To No Good
Don't Ask, Me To
Enjoy Them, Just For You
Ask Yourself,
What I Would Do
To Prostitute, Myself,
To Live With Fortune And Shame
Ooh, Yea,
When You Should Have Turned To The Hearts Of The Ones
That You Would Not Save,
Ooh, Now,
I Told You
When I Found You
All That Amounts To
Is Love That You've Crippled For Fortune And Fame!
