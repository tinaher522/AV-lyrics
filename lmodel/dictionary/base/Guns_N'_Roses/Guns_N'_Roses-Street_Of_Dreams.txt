<song artist="Guns_N'_Roses" title="Street_Of_Dreams">
All the love in the world couldn't save you
All the innocence inside
You know I tried so hard to make you
Oh, to make you change your mind
And it hurts too much to see you
And how you left yourself behind
You know I wouldn't want to be you
Now there's a hell I can't describe
So now I wander through my days
And try to find my ways
To the feelings that I felt
I saved for you and no one else
And though as long as this road seems
I know it's called the street of dreams
But that's not stardust on my feet
It leaves a taste that's bittersweet
That's called the blues
I don't know just what I should do
Everywhere I go I see you
Though it's what you planned, this much is true
What I thought was beautiful don't live inside of you anymore
I don't know just what I should do
Everywhere I go I see you
You know it's what you planned, this much is true, oh oh
What I thought was beautiful don't live inside of you anymore, oh oh, ah
What this means to me
Is more than I know you believe
What I thought of you now
Has cost more that it should for me
What I thought was true before
Were lies I couldn't see
What I thought was beautiful
Is only memories
Oh oh oh, what'd I tell you
Oh oh oh, that's what I tell you
Oh oh oh
Oh oh inside of you
