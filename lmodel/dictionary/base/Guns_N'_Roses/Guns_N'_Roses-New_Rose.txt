Is she really going out with him?
Hey!
I got a feeling inside of me
It's kind of strange like a stormy sea
I don't know why, don't know why
These kind of things got to be
I got a new rose, I got it good
Yes, I knew that I always would
I can't stop to mess around
I got a brand new rose in town
See the Sun, see the sunny skies
Don't get too close it'll burn your eyes
Don't you run away that way
Come back another day
I got a new rose, I got it good
Yes, I knew that I always would
I can't stop to mess around
I got a brand new rose in town
I never thought this could happen to me
I'm a strange washing machine
I never served somebody this sane
I haven't met her, never be too late
Hey!
I got a feeling inside of me
It's kind of strange like a stormy sea
I don't know why, don't know why
I guess these things have got to be
I got a new rose, I got it good
Yes, I knew that I always would
I can't stop to mess around
I got a brand new rose in town
