<song artist="Guns_N'_Roses" title="You_Can't_Put_Your_Arms_Around_A_Memory">
This one's for you, Johnny
It doesn't pay to try
All the smart boys know why
It doesn't mean I didn't try
I just never know why
It isn't 'cause I'm all alone
Oh, baby, you're not home
And when I'm home
Big deal, I'm still alone
It's so restless as I am
Beat my head against a pole
Try to knock some sense, down 'side my bones
And even though I don't show
Those guys are so old
Can't put your arms around a memory
Can't put your arms around a memory
Can't put your arms around a memory
Don't try
Don't try
You're just a bastard kid
And you got no name
Could you live with me?
Go on and say
And even though it don't show
Those guys are so old
Can't put your arms around a memory
Can't put your arms around a memory
Can't put your arms around a memory
Don't try
Don't try
Johnny, you're me
Yeah, your memory
I want to put my arms around your memory
I can't try... 
I can't try
Don't try
Come on
L.A.M.F. 
Like a motherfucker
Yo Johnny
What color were her eyes?
Oh, she was wearing shades?
Fuck it
