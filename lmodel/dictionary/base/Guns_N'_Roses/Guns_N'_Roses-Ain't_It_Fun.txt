<song artist="Guns_N'_Roses" title="Ain't_It_Fun">
Ain't it fun when you're always on the run
Ain't it fun when your friends despise what you become
Ain't it fun when you get so high
Well... that you, you just can't come
Ain't it fun when you know that you going to die young
It's such fun
Good fun
Such fun (5x)
Yeah fun
Such fun
Such...
Ain't it fun when you take good care of number one
Ain't it fun when you feel like you just got to get a gun
Ain't it fun when you... just... just... just can't seem to find your tongue
'Cause you stuck it too deep into something that really stung
Such fun
Someone come up to me, they spit right in my face
I didn't even feel it
It was such a disgrace
I punched my fist right through the glass
I didn't even feel it
But it happened so fast
Such fun (11x)
Such...
Fun
Ain't it fun when you tell her she's just a cunt
Ain't it fun when you she splits you and leaves you on the bum
Well, ain't it fun when you've broken up every band that you've ever begun
Ain't it fun when you know that you're going to die young
It's such fun
Such fun (11x)
Good fun
Such fun
