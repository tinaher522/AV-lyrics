<song artist="Guns_N'_Roses" title="It's_Alright">
Told you once about your friends and neighbors
They were always seeking but they'll never find
That it's alright, yes it's alright
Where to go, Where to see
It's always been that way and it can never be
but it's alright, yes its alright
Give it all and ask for no return
And very soon you'll see and you'll begin to learn
that it's alright, yes it's alright
Don't you know that it's so good for you 
You can be making love and see it all go through
But it's alright, 'cos it alright
So I told you once about your friends and neighbors
They were always seeking but they'll never find it
It's alright, 'cos it's alright
