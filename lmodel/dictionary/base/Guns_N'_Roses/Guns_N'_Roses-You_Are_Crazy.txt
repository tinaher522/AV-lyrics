<song artist="Guns_N'_Roses" title="You_Are_Crazy">
I've been lookin' for a trace
Lookin' for a heart
Lookin' for a lover in a world
That's much too dark
You don't want my love
You want satisfaction
(Ooh yeah)
You don't need my love
You've got to find yourself
Another piece of the action, yeah
Say where you goin'?
What you gonna do?
I've been lookin' everywhere
I've been lookin' for you
You don't want my love
You want satisfaction
(I've got your satisfaction)
You don't need my love
You've got to find yourself
Another piece of the action
'Cause your crazy
(Crazy)
You're fuckin' crazy
(Oh my)
You know you're crazy
(Oh child)
I said you're crazy
Say boy where ya coming from?
Where'd you get that point of view?
When I was younger
Said I knew someone like you and they said
You don't want my love
You want satisfaction
(Yeah)
You don't need my love
You've gotta find yourself
Another piece of the action
'Cause you're crazy
(Crazy)
You're fuckin' crazy
(Oh my)
You know you're crazy
(Oh child)
I said you're crazy
Ooh, you're crazy
You know you're crazy
Ooh yeah, you're crazy
You know you're crazy
You know you are
Bring it down
You're fuckin' crazy
