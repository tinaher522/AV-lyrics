<song artist="Guns_N'_Roses" title="Black_Leather">
Well, she's all geared up, walking down the street
And I can feel the slime, dripping down her sleeve
Well, you can't refuse and you just can't choose what she's going to do (2x)
Well, it's late at night, and I'm all alone
And I can hear her boots as she's near her home
Well, you can't refuse and you just can't choose what she's going to do (2x)
Scratch, scratch, she's clawing at the door
Whoa, no, I can't take it anymore
Crack, crack, I'm feeling so sore
I never should asked for black leather
Black leather
Ooh, black leather
Ow black leather
And you can try to hide, but you won't get far
You can let her in, and you'll start again
Well, you can't refuse and you just can't choose what she's going to do (2x)
Scratch, scratch, she's clawing at the door
Whoa, no, I can't take it anymore
Crack, crack, I'm feeling so sore
I never should asked for black leather
Black leather
Ooh, black leather
Ow black leather
Black leather
