<song artist="Guns_N'_Roses" title="Scrapped">
Don't you try to stop us now
I just refuse
Don't you try to stop us now
'Cause I just won't let you
Sometimes I feel like
The world is on top of me
Breaking me down with
An endless monotony
Sometimes I feel like
There's nothing that's stopping me
All things are possible
I am unstoppable
Some may convince you
No one can break through
I'm here to tell you
You're worth more than they tell you
Don't you try to stop us now
I just refuse
Don't you try to stop us now
'Cause I just won't let you
Sometimes I feel like
My life's a catastrophe
Can't understand why
It seems like it has to be
Sometimes I feel like
It's all opened up for me
Nothing's impossible
I am inconquerable
No one can make you
Do what they want to
You know you're stronger
Than the lies that they tell you
Don't you try to stop us now
I just refuse
Don't you try to stop us now
'Cause I just won't let you
I just refuse
Some may convince you
No one can break through
You know you're stronger
Than the lies that they tell you
(I'd give anything to know)
Don't you try to stop us now
I just refuse
(I would have never made it so far)
Don't you try to stop us now
'Cause I just won't let you
(I'd give anything to know)
Don't you try to stop us now
(How you live with yourself)
I just refuse
(I would have never made it so far)
Don't you try to stop us now
'Cause I just won't let you
(All by myself)
Believe in yourself
