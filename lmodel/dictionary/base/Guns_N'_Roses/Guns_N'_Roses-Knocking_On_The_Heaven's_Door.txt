<song artist="Guns_N'_Roses" title="Knocking_On_The_Heaven's_Door">
Mama, take this badge off of me
I can't use it anymore
It's getting dark, too dark for me to see
Feels like I'm knocking on heaven's door
Knock, knock, knocking on heaven's door
Knock, knock, knocking on heaven's door
Knock, knock, knocking on heaven's door
Knock, knock, knocking on heaven's door
Mama, put my guns in the ground
I can't shoot them anymore
That cold black cloud is coming down
Feels like I'm knocking on heaven's door
Knock, knock, knocking on heaven's door
Knock, knock, knocking on heaven's door
Knock, knock, knocking on heaven's door
Knock, knock, knocking on heaven's door
Knock, knocking on heaven's door
You just better start sniffing your own rank subjugation Jack
'Cause it's just you against your tattered libido
The bank and the mortician, forever man
And it wouldn't be luck, if you could get out of life alive
Knock, knock, knocking on heaven's door
Knock, knock, knocking on heaven's door
Knock, knock, knocking on heaven's door
