<song artist="Guns_N'_Roses" title="I_Don't_Care_About_You">
I'm from South Philadelphia up on Avenue C.
I've seen empty hands that was waitin' to freeze up from the power at home.
I don't care about you,
Fuck you !
I don't care about you,
Fuck you !
I've seen Hollywood Boulevard
Welfare hotel
I spent the night in jail
In the Wilcox Hotel
I don't care about you,
Fuck you !
I don't care about you,
Fuck you !
I don't care about you,
I've seen an old man have a heart attack in Manhattan
Well he died while we just stood there lookin' at him
Ain't he cute ?
I don't care about you,
Fuck you !
I don't care about you,
Fuck you !
I don't care about you,
I seen mad rollin' drunks
I seen bodies in the street
I saw a man who was sleepin' in his own puke
And a man with no legs crawlin' down
Fifth Street tryin' just to get somethin' to eat.
I don't care about you,
Fuck you !
I don't care about you,
Fuck you !
I don't care about you,
Fuck you !
I don't care about you
Fuck you !
"That hurt, man! [laughs]"
"Perfect."
