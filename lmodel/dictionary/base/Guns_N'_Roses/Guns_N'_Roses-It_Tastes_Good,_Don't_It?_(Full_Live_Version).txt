<song artist="Guns_N'_Roses" title="It_Tastes_Good,_Don't_It?_(Full_Live_Version)">
I'm like a little bitty kid with a real big mouth
And you're gonna have to catch me if you wanna wash it out
Standin' on the corner
Callin' you names
With my juvenile skills and juvenile games
I'm a fast motherfucker
Tell you 'bout it sucker
Fuck with me and I'll fuck your mother
Your sister too
Your best girlfriend
Line 'em up
Put 'em end to end
I stick it in, pull it out
Then I grab your face
And cum in your mouth
Said, it tastes good, don't it?
Said, it tastes good, and you know it
Said, it tastes good, don't it?
Said, it tastes good, and you know it
If you're lookin' for trouble
I'm the one
If you're lookin' for a fight
Then we'll have some fun
Stupid motherfuckers shouldn't have ragged on me
They can't see what I can see
I've been up
I've been down
Kickin' shit all over this town
What they say means nothin' to me
Sweet, sweet taste of victory
I said it tastes good, don't it?
I said it tastes good, and you know it
God dammit, God dammit, said it tastes good, don't it?
It tastes good, and you know it
Take it away, Slash
OH YEAH!
I said it tastes good, don't it?
I said it tastes good, and you know it
I said it tastes good, don't it?
I said it tastes good, and you know it
I said it tastes good, don't it?
I said it tastes good, don't it?
I said it tastes good, don't it?
I said it tastes good, and you know it
I said it tastes good, don't it?
I said it tastes good, and you know it
I said it tastes good, don't it?
I said it tastes good, motherfucker you know it
I said it tastes good, don't it?
WOOOAAAH, OH YEAH!
