<song artist="Guns_N'_Roses" title="Look_At_Your_Game_Girl">
There's a time for living
Time keeps on flying
Think you're loving baby
But all you're doing is crying
Chorus:
Can you feel
Are those things real
Look at your game, girl
Look at your game, girl
What a mad delusion
Living in that confusion
Frustration and doubt
Can you ever live without the game
The sad, sad game
Mad game
Just to say loves' enough
If it can't be true
Oh, you can tell those lies baby but you're only fooling you
Chorus
Can you feel
I know these feeling ain't real
Then you better stop tryin'
Or you're gonna play cryin'
Stop tryin'
Or you're gonna play cryin'
Stop tryin'
That's the game
Sad, sad game
Mad game
Sad game
(spoken)
Thanks, Chas and Jack
