<song artist="Guns_N'_Roses" title="Bad_Obsession">
I can't stop thinkin'
Thinkin' 'bout sinkin'
Sinkin' down into my bed
I call my mother
She's just a cunt now
She said I'm sick in the head
She said, "You ain't special.
So who you foolin'?
Don't try to give me a line."
But I can't stop thinkin' 'bout
Seein' ya one more time, oh no
But I already left you
And you're better off left behind
It's a bad obsession
It's always messin'
It's always messin' my mind
It's a bad obsession
It's always messin'
It's always messin' my mind
Too bad you're fucked up
I used to be wasted
Always tried to take it
Take it down into my vein
I call the doctor
He's just another
He said I'm sick in the brain
He said, "You ain't special.
So who you foolin'?
Don't try to give me a line."
But I can't stop thinkin' 'bout
Doin' it one more time, oh no
But I already left you
And you're better off left behind, oh yeah
Aw it's a bad obsession
It's always messin'
It's always messin' my mind
It's a bad obsession
It's always messin'
It's always messin' my mind
So bad, boy
It's a
It's a
Heads up
It's a bad obsession
It's always messin'
It's always messin' my mind
Now it's a bad obsession
It's always messin'
It's always messin' my mind
But I can't stop thinkin' 'bout
Doin' it one more time, oh no
See I already left you
And you're better off left behind, oh no, oh no
It's a bad obsession
And you're always messin' my mind
See I already left you
And you're better off left behind, uh oh, uh oh
Maybe you'll do better next time
