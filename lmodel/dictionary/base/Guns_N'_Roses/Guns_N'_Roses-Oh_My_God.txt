<song artist="Guns_N'_Roses" title="Oh_My_God">
It's not how you're thinking
Or as you've imagined
You've been living in the shade of
Beliefs that were fashioned
To keep you in slavery and drain out your soul
But what can I do when there's so many liars
That crawl through your veins
Like millions of spiders
That seek out their victims
And ruin the wiser
Watch out
Gotcha
Oh my god
I can't deny this
I've been taught just to kill and fight this
To bury it deeper where nobody can find it
Like nobody wanted to know
So give it away
Like they're not gonna fuck you
How long can you bear him
To come back and haunt you
To burn past your feelings
And cause you to suffer
You're starting to bleed
They don't give you up
Before its too late
What will you offer
In way of a healing
I'm so confused, abused, misused
Oh my god
I can't deny this
I've been taught just to kill and fight this
To bury it deeper where nobody can find it
Like nobody wouldn't know
Ooh, if it opens your eyes
This is better than a strong compromise
I was willing to be lost in the shuffle
If only you had let me know
Ooh, if it opens your eyes
This is better than the last compromise
I was willing to be lost in the shadows
If only you had let me know
And they wont give in
Cause they know what they're after
A kick in the face
Like its all that would matter
Ohh
Oh my god
I can't deny this
I've been taught just to murder and fight this
To bury it deeper where no one can find it
Cuz nobody wouldn't know
Ooh, if it opens your eyes
This is better than a good compromise
I was willing to be lost in the shuffle
If only you had let me know
Ooh, well it's on with the show
Like the tide down on the ocean
The waves already set in motion
The only one in the game that's lost is you
