<song artist="Guns_N'_Roses" title="Blues">
All the love in the world couldn't save you
Or the innocence inside
You know I tried so hard to make you
To make you change your mind
And it hurts too much to see you
And how you left yourself behind
You know I wouldn't wanna be you
Now there's a hell I can't describe
So now I wander through my daze
Trying to find my ways
To the feelings that I felt
I saved for you and no one else
And though as long as this road seems
I know it's called the street of dreams
But that's not stardust on my feet
It leaves a taste that's bittersweet
That's called the blues
I don't know just what I should do
Everywhere I go I see you
Although it's what we planned
This much is true
What I thought was beautiful
Don't live inside of you anymore
I don't know just what I should do
Everywhere I go I see you
Although it's what we planned
This much is true
What I thought was beautiful
Don't live inside of you anymore
What this means to me
Is more than I know you believe
What I thought of you now
Has cost more than it should for me
What I thought was true before
Were lies I couldn't see
What I thought was beautiful
Was only memories
