<song artist="Guns_N'_Roses" title="Pour_Some_Sugar_On_Me">
Love me like a bomb, baby, come an' get it on
Livin' like a lover with a radar phone
Lookin' like a tramp, like a video vamp
Demolition woman, can I be your man? (be your man)
Razzle-little, dazzle-little, flash a little light
Television lover, baby, go all night
Sometime, anytime, sugar me sweet
Little Miss Innocent, sugar me, yeah
Yeah
C'mon
Take a bottle, shake it up
Break the bubble, break it up
(Pour some sugar on me) Ooh, in the name of love
(Pour some sugar on me) Come on, fire me up
(Pour your sugar on me) I can't get enough
I'm hot, sticky sweet
From my head to my feet, yeah
Listen
Red light, yellow light, green light, go
Crazy little woman in a one man show
Mirror queen, mannequin, rhythm of love
Sweet dream, saccharine, loosen up (loosen up)
A-loosen up
You gotta please a little, squeeze a little, tease a little more
Easy operator, come a-knockin' on my door
Sometime, anytime, sugar me sweet
Little Miss Innocent, sugar me, yeah
Yeah
Give a lil' more
Take a bottle, shake it up
Break the bubble, break it up
(Pour some sugar on me) Ooh, in the name of love
(Pour some sugar on me) Come on, fire me up
(Pour your sugar on me) Oh, I can't get enough
I'm hot, sticky sweet
From my head to my feet, yeah
You've got the peaches, I got the cream
Sweet to taste, saccharine
'Cause I'm hot (hot), so hot (hot), sticky sweet
From my head (head, head) to my feet
Do you take sugar?
One lump or two?
Take a bottle, shake it up (shake it up)
(Break the bubble), break it up (break it up)
(Pour some sugar on me) Ooh, in the name of love
(Pour some sugar on me) Come on, fire me up
(Pour your sugar on me) Oh, I can't get enough
(Pour some sugar on me) Oh, in the name of love
(Pour some sugar on me) Come get it, come get it
(Pour your sugar on me) Ohh...
(Pour your sugar on me) Yeah, hey sugar me
