<song artist="Guns_N'_Roses" title="I.R.S.">
Love, oh ohh
Is it true?
What they say of you?
Gonna call the President
Gonna call a Private I
Gonna get the IRS
Gonna need the FBI
There's not anymore that I can do
All the reasons that you gave, I'd follow you
To when you plead the fifth
That'd be the end of time, its true
Wouldn't be the first time I've been wrong
Wouldn't be the last, I should have known
Through all the rumors I can tell
Some things didn't work so well
Well anyway, it feels the same
As when you first told me you were gone
So long ago, but I've still held on
Through all the emotions the love and the sex
That's the truth and here's the worst yet
Wouldn't even matter, the things that I'd say
You made your mind up and gone anyway
There's no use now in dragging it on
Could've seen it coming all along
Well it's true, oh
I had my doubts with you
Gonna call the President
Gonna call myself a private I
Gonna need the IRS
Gonna get the FBI
Gonna make this a federal case
Gonna wave it right down in your face
Read it daily with your morning news
With a sweet hangover and the headlines too, now
I bet you're thinking I'm doing this all for my health
I should've looked again then at somebody else
Feelin' like I've done way more than wrong
Feelin' like I'm living inside of this song
Feelin' like I'm just too tired to care
Feelin' like I done more than my share
Could it be the way that I've carried on
Like a broken record for so long
What can I do?
Ooh, oh.
I'm gonna call the President
I'm gonna call a private I
Gonna get the IRS
Gonna need myself the FBI
Ooh, what shall I do
I gave my heart to you, oh
It's such a crime, you know it's true
Gonna call the president
Gonna need myself a private I
Ooh, gonna need the IRS
Gonna get the FBI
Gonna make it a federal case
Gonna wave it right down in your face
Read it daily with your morning news
With a sweet hangover and the headlines too
There's not anymore that I can do
