Take me down to the Paradise City
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Oh, won't you please take me home?
Take me down to the Paradise City
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Take me home
Oh, won't you please take me home?
Just an urchin livin' under the street
Hard case that's tough to beat
I'm your charity case, so buy me somethin' to eat
I'll pay you at another time, take it to the end of the line
Ragz to richez or so they say
Ya gotta keep pushin' for the fortune and fame
It's all a gamble when it's just a game
Ya treat it like a capital crime, everybody's doing their time
Take me down to the Paradise City
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Oh, won't you please take me home?
Take me down to the Paradise City
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Take me home
Strapped in the chair of the city's gas chamber
Why I'm here I can't quite remember
The surgeon general says it's hazardous to breathe
I'd have another cigarette but I can't see
Tell me who you're gonna believe
Take me down to the Paradise City
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Take me home, yeah
Take me down to the Paradise City
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Oh, won't you please take me home?
So far away, so far away, so far away, so far away
Captain America's been torn apart
Now he's a court jester with a broken heart
He said, "Turn me around and take me back to the start
I must be losin' my mind, "Are you blind?"
I've seen it all a million times
Take me down to the Paradise City
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Take me home
Take me down to the Paradise City
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Oh, won't you please take me home?
Take me down to the Paradise City
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Take me home
Take me down to the Paradise City
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Take me home
Oh, won't you please take me home?
Oh, I wanna go, I wanna go
Oh, won't you please take me home?
Oh, won't you please take me home?
Take me down to the Paradise City
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Take me home
Oh, won't you please take me home?
