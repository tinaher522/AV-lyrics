<song artist="Guns_N'_Roses" title="Attitude">
Yeah!
Attitude
Some fucking attitude
I can't believe what you say to me
You got some attitude
Inside that fetal brain
There's got to be a whore
If you don't shut your mouth
You're going to feel the floor, yeah!
Attitude, what you've got
Some fucking attitude
Attitude is what you've got
Some fucking attitude
Yeah, all right
Inside that fetal brain
There's got to be a whore
If you don't shut your mouth
You're going to feel the motherfucking guitar!
Oh, attitude (Attitude)
Some fucking attitude (Attitude)
I can't believe what you say to me
You got some attitude
Oh, attitude
Some fucking attitude
I can't believe what you say to me
You got some attitude
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
