<song artist="Who" title="The_Good's_Gone">
I know when I've had enough
When I think your love is rough
The good's gone
The good's gone
The good's gone
The good's gone
The good's gone out of our love
I know it's wrong
We should enjoy it, but
The good's gone
The good's gone
Once, we used to get along
Now, each time we kiss, it's wrong
The good's gone
The good's gone
The good's gone
The good's gone
The good's gone out of our love
I know it's wrong
We should enjoy it, but
The good's gone
The good's gone
Now it ain't no fun
And the good's gone now
We used to love as one
But we have forgotten now
I know when I've had enough
When I think your love is rough
The good's gone
The good's gone
The good's gone
The good's gone
The good's gone out of our love
I know it's wrong
We should enjoy it, but
The good's gone
The good's gone
It's gone forever
