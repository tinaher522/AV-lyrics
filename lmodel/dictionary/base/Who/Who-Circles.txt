<song artist="Who" title="Circles">
Circles, my head is going round in circles
My mind is caught up in a whirlpool
Dragging me down
Time will tell if I'll take the homeward track
Dizziness will make my feet walk back
Walk right back to you
Everything I do, I think of you
No matter how I try, I can't get by
These circles, leading me back to you
Round and around and around and around and around
and around and around and around and around
And round and round like a fool I go
Down and down in the pool I go
Dragging me down
Everything I do, I think of you
No matter how I try, I can't get by
These circles, leading me back to you
There one thing could kill the pain of losing you
But it gets me so dizzy then I'm walking right back again
Back to you
Time will tell if these dreams are nearly fact
Don't know why I left, I'm coming back
Coming on back to you
