<song artist="Who" title="Poetry_Cornered">
It's "Poetry Cornered".
And when I look upon your face
I would that we were in some place
Where you could be my pet
My dove
So live with me
And be my vole
"Vole"? Hang on.
Where you could be my pet
My dove
Live with me
And be my... vole
Hang on, that can't be right.
