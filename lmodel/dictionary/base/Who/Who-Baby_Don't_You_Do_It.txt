<song artist="Who" title="Baby_Don't_You_Do_It">
Ahh, baby, don't you do it, don't do it, baby
Don't you break my heart
Please, don't do it, baby, don't you break my heart
Please, don't you do it, baby
Yeah, I sacrifice to make laughter, kept nothin' for myself 
Now you wanna leave me for the love of someone else 
I'm tryin' to do my best 
Yeah, I'm tryin' to do my best 
Don't you do it, don't do it, babe 
Don't you break my heart 
Please, don't you do it, babe
My biggest mistake was lovin' you too much, and lettin' you know 
'Cause now you got me where you want me, and you gonna let me go 
My pride is all gone, whether right or wrong 
I need you, baby, I'm gonna keep on keepin' on 
I'm tryin' to do my best 
Yeah, I'm tryin' to do my best 
Don't do it, baby 
Don't you break my heart now 
I go down to the river and there I'll be 
I'm gonna jump right in, baby, if you don't see about me 
I'm tryin' to do my best 
Yeah, I'm tryin' to do my best 
Don't do it, baby 
Open up your eyes, can't you see I need you? 
Open up your heart, can't you see I love you? 
I can't go on without you, my life's no good without you 
I can't go on without you, my life's no good without you 
Yeah, don't you do it 
Please, don't do it, baby 
Don't you break my heart now
