<song artist="Who" title="No_Time">
No time left for you
On my way to better things
No time left for you
I found myself some wings
No time left for you
Distant roads are callin' me
No time left for you
Da un da un da un da un da
No time for a summer friend
No time for the love you send
Seasons change and so did I
You need not wonder why, you need not wonder why
There's no time left for you, no time left for you
No time left for you
On my way to better things
No time left for you
I found myself some wings
No time left for you
Distant roads are callin' me
No time left for you
Day un gay un day un gay un day
No time for a gentle rain
No time for my watch and chain
No time for revolving doors
No time for the killin' floor, no time for the killin' floor
There's no time left for you, no time left for you
No time for a summer friend
No time for the love you send
Seasons change and so did I
You need not wonder why, you need not wonder why
There's no time left for you, no time left for you
No time, no time, no time, no time
No time, no time, no time, no time
I got, got, got, got no time
I got, got, got, got no time
I got, got, got, got no time
No, no, no, no, no, no, no time
No, no, no, no, no, no, no time
I got, got, got, got no time
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no time
I got no time, got no time
Got no time, got no time, got no time
Got no time, got no time
