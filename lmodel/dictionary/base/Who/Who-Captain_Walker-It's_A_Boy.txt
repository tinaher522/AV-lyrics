<song artist="Who" title="Captain_Walker-It's_A_Boy">
Narrator:
Captain Walker didn't come home
His unborn child will never know him
We believe him missing with a number of men
Don't expect to see him again
He's believed to be missing with a number of men
Don't expect to see him again
First Nurse:
It's a boy, Mrs. Walker, it's a boy
It's a boy, Mrs. Walker, it's a boy
First Nurse, Second Nurse and Doctor:
A son! A son! A son!
Second Nurse:
Hear the joyful celebrations in the street
It's a boy born on this first day of peace
First Nurse, Second Nurse and Doctor:
We've won! A son! We've won!
