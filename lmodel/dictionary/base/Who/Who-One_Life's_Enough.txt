<song artist="Who" title="One_Life's_Enough">
There's a scene
Indelible, it hangs before my eyes
In our teens, incredibly
Together with no ties
That was a life enough for me
One life's enough for me
Throw back your heard
Let your body curve
Into the long grass of the bed
Pull me down into your hair
And I'll push and swerve
As we both gasp in the evening air
Throw back your head
Let your body curve
Into the long grass of the bed
Pull me down into your hair
And I'll push and swerve
As we both gasp in the evening air
