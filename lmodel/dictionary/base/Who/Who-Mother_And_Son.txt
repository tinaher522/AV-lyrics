<song artist="Who" title="Mother_And_Son">
NORA:
Tommy can you hear me?
Tommy can you hear me?
Tommy can you hear me?
Tommy can you hear me?
Tommy, Tommy, Tommy, Tommy?
TOMMY:
Mother! Father!
Touch me, feel me...
Who am I? Where did I come from?
Have you known me?  Have you seen me?
Mother?
NORA:
You’re a hero, you are famous.
You’re a champion of the young.
You are rich, but it’s so absurd to try
To explain all the things you’ve done.
You’re adored and you’re loved.
Thousands watch you play
Pinball!  It’s a fever,
And you’re the master of the game.
And now that you’re whole
You’ll be champion of the very soul
TOMMY:
Yes, I’m healed:
Delivered from silent darkness.
No more locked doors,
Or stifled screams!
Pinball?
What I see now before me,
Is far beyond a game,
Beyond your wildest dreams!
Those who love me have a higher path to follow now.
And you, dear Mother, too, must be prepared!
