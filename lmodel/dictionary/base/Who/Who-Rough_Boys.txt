Tough boys
Running the streets
Come a little closer
Rough toys
Under the sheets
Nobody knows her
Rough boys
Don't walk away
I very nearly missed you
Tough boys
Come over here
I wanna bite and kiss you
I wanna see what I can find
Tough kids
Take a bottle of wine
When your deal is broken
Ten quid
She's so easy to find
Not a word is spoken
Rough boys
Don't walk away
I'm still pretty blissed here
Tough boy
I'm gonna carry you home
You got pretty pissed dear
Gonna get inside you
Gonna get inside your bitter mind
Rough boys
Don't walk away
I wanna buy you leather
Make noise
Try and talk me away
We can't be seen together
Tough kids
What can I do?
I'm so pale and weedy
Rough fits
In my Hush Puppy shoes
But I'm still pleading
Tough boys
Running the streets
Come a little closer
Rough toys
Under the sheets
Nobody knows her
Rough boys
Don't walk away
I very nearly missed you
Tough boys
Come over here
I wanna bite and kiss you
I wanna see what I can find!
