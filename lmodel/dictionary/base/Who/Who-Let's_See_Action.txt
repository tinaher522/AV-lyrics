<song artist="Who" title="Let's_See_Action">
Let's see action
Let's see people
Let's see freedom
Let's see who cares
Take me with you
When you leave me
And my shell behind us there
I have learned it
Known who burned me
Avatar has warmed my feet
Take me with you
Let me see you
Time and life can meet
Nothing is
Everything
Everything is
Nothing is
Please the people
Audiences
Break the fences
Nothing is
Let's see action
Let's see people
Let's see freedom
In the air
Let's see action
Let's see people
Let's be free
Let's see who cares
Let's see action
Let's see people
Let's see freedom
In the air
Let's see action
Let's see people
Let's be free
Let's see who cares
Give me a drink boy, wash my feet
I'm so tired of running from my own heat
Take this package and here's what you do
Gonna get this information through
I don't know where I'm going
I don't know what I need
But I'll get to where I'm gonna end up
And that's alright by me
Let's see action
Let's see people
Let's see freedom
In the air
Let's see action
Let's see people
Let's be free
And see who cares
Let's see action
Let's see people
Let's see freedom
In the air
Let's see action
Let's see people
Let's be free
Let's see who cares
Nothing is
Everything
Everything is
Nothing
Nothing is
Everything
Everything is
Nothing
