<song artist="Who" title="There's_A_Doctor">
Father:
There's a doctor I've found
Could bring us all joy!
There's a doctor I've found could cure the boy!
There's a doctor I've found could cure the boy!
There's a man I've found could remove his sorrow,
He lives in this town, let's see him tomorrow,
He lives in this town, let's see him tomorrow!
