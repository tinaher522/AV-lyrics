<song artist="Who" title="You_Better_You_Bet">
You better you better you bet, ooh
You better you better you bet, ooh
You better you better you bet, ooh
You better you better you bet, ooh
I call you on the telephone
My voice too rough with cigarettes (ooh)
I sometimes feel I should just go home
But I'm dealing with a memory that never forgets (ooh)
I love to hear you say my name
Especially when you say yes (ooh)
I got your body right now on my mind
But I drunk myself blind to the sound of old T-Rex
Mmm
To the sound of old T-Rex
Oh, and "Who's Next"
When I say I love you you say you better
(You better you better you bet)
When I say I need you you say you better
(You better you better you bet)
You better bet your life
Or love will cut you, cut you like a knife
I want those feeble-minded
Axes overthrown (ooh)
I'm not into your passport picture
I just like your nose (ooh)
You welcome me with open arms
And open legs (ooh)
I know only fools have needs
But this one never begs
I don't really mind how much you love me
Ooh, a little is all right
When you say come over and spend the night
Tonight, tonight
When I say I love you you say you better
(You better you better you bet)
When I say I need you you say you better
(You better you better you bet)
You better bet your life
Or love will cut you, cut you like a knife
I lay on the bed with you
We could make some book of records
Your dog keeps licking my nose
And chewing up all those letters
Saying "you better"
You better bet your life
You better love me, all the time now
You better shove me back into line now
You better love me, all the time now
You better shove me back into line now
I showed up late one night
With a neon light for a visa (ooh)
But knowing I'm so eager to fight
Can't make letting me in any easier (ooh)
I know that I been wearing crazy clothes
And I look pretty crappy sometimes (ooh)
But my body feels so good
And I still sing a razor line every time (ooh)
And when it comes to all night living
I know what I'm giving
I've got it all down to a tee
And it's free
When I say I love you you say you better
(You better you better you bet)
When I say I need you you say you better
(You better you better you bet)
When I say I love you you say you better
(You better you better you bet)
When I say I need you you scream you better
(You better you better you bet)
Ooh, when I say I love you you say you better
(You better you better you bet)
And when I say I need you you say you better
(You better you better you bet)
When I say I love you you say you better
(You better you better you bet)
And when I say I need you you scream you better
(You better you better you bet)
You better bet your life
Or love will cut you
Just like a knife
