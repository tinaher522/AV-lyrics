<song artist="Who" title="They_Are_All_In_Love">
Where do you walk on sunny times
When the rivers gleam and the buildings shine
How do you feel when the pollen falls
And the summer clothes brighten gloomy halls?
And they're all in love
And they're all in love
Where do you fit in zzzzip magazine
Where the past is the hero and the present a queen
Just tell me right now where do you fit in
With blood in your eye and a passion for gin?
And they're all in love
And they're all in love
Hey, goodbye all you punks; stay young and stay high
Hand me my chequebook and I'll crawl off to die
Like a woman in childbirth grown ugly in a flash
I'm seen magic and pain, now I'm recycling trash
And they're all in love
And they're all in love
And they're all in love
And they're all in love
