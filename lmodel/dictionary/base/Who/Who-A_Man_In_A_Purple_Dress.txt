<song artist="Who" title="A_Man_In_A_Purple_Dress">
How dare you wear robes and reside
How dare you cover your head to hide
Your face from God
How dare you smile from behind your beard
To hide the fact your heart's afeared
And wave your rod
How dare you be the one to assess
Me, in this God-forsaken mess
You, a man, in a purple dress
A man in a purple dress
You are all the same
Gilded and absurd
Regal, fast to blame
Rulers by lost word
Men above men, or prats
In your high hats
You priest, you mullah so high
You pope, you wise rabbi
You're invisible to me
Like vapour on the sea
How dare you? Do you think I'll quietly go?
You are much braver than you know
For I can't die
Your staff, your stick, your special cap
They'll protect in Hell? What crap!
Believe the lie
How dare you be the one to assess
Me, in this God-forsaken mess
You, a man, in a purple dress
A man in a purple dress
When you place your frown
Between my God and prayer
However grand your crown
Or dignified your hair
Men above men, or prats
In your high hats
You priest, you mullah so high
You pope, you wise rabbi
You're invisible to me
Like vapour on the sea
I lovingly mock you noble lords
We all dress up to grand awards
I do that as well
I dare condemn your fashion sense
At least you're not astride a fence
That would not sell
But I will deliver this address
Your soul's condition don't impress
You, a man, in a purple dress
A man in a purple dress
