<song artist="Who" title="The_Acid_Queen_(Soundtrack_Version)">
If your child ain't all he should be now
This girl will put him right
I'll show him what he could be now
Just give me one night
I'm the Gypsy - the Acid Queen
Pay me before I start
I'm the Gypsy and I'm guaranteed
To mend his aching heart
Give us a room - close the door
Leave us for a while
He won't be a boy no more
Young, but not a child
I'm the Gypsy - the Acid Queen
Pay me before I start
I'm the Gypsy
I'm guaranteed to tear your soul apart
Gather your wits and hold on fast
Your mind must learn to roam
Just as the Gypsy Queen must do
You're gonna hit the road
My work's begun, now look at him
He's never been more alive
His head it shakes, his fingers clutch
Watch his body writhe
I'm the Gypsy - the Acid Queen
Pay me before I start
I'm the Gypsy I'm guaranteed to break your little heart
If your child ain't all he should be now
This girl will put him right
I'll show him what he could be now
Just give me one more night
I'm the Gypsy - the Acid Queen
Pay me before I start
I'm the Gypsy
I'm guaranteed to tear his soul apart
