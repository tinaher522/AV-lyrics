Thank you. We'd like to play three hit singles from our past for ya. And uh, uh, we don't do that one, sorry. Three selected hit singles, the three, the three easiest. Uh, there's "Substitute", which we like very much. Thank you. That was our first number four. And uh, "Happy Jack", which was our first, first number one in Germany. Bu dum bum bum bum, bu dum bum bum bum... and funnily enough, our first big hit record in the States. And "I'm A Boy", which, according to the, thank you, according to the Melody Maker, was our first number one in England, I think for about half an hour. Right, here we go. Let's start it off with "Substitute".
