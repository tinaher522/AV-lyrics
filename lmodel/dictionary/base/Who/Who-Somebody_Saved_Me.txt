<song artist="Who" title="Somebody_Saved_Me">
I stood at the door beside her
But she wouldn't let me pass
I was such a boor and I lied to her
I said I didn't really want her ass
I went away in the mud and rain
The gang became snide and laughed
I was slayed but I smiled and the pain
Began to subside at last
And when I got back to my hotel
I wondered if the thunder meant I'd landed in hell
And on the forecourt I slipped and fell
I cracked my stupid head and I heard a bell
I thought "Hey!"
Somebody saved me, it happened again
Somebody saved me, I thank you my friend
Somebody saved me, from a fate worse than heaven
'Cause if I'd had her for just an hour
I'd have wanted her forever
Somebody saved me
You would've thought that I'd have learned
Twenty years ago or more
A beautiful girl raised her mouth and yearned
But I didn't know what lips were for
I ran away in the mud and rain
The weather here is never too bright
She'd had an affray with her man and came
For solace and the means to fight
She finally bored with seducing me
And took up with some geezer from the Ealing scene
And it nearly killed him like it would've killed me
When her original man snapped his fingers and she obeyed
She obeyed
Somebody saved me, it happened again
Somebody saved me, I thank you my friend
Somebody saved me, from a fate worse than heaven
'Cause if I'd had her for just an hour
I'd have wanted her forever
Somebody saved me, yeah
Somebody saved me
I don't know about guardian angels
All I know about's staying alive
I can't shout about spiritual labels
When little ones die and big ones thrive
All I know is that I've been making it
There've been times I didn't deserve to
Every show there's been more faking it
But right at the point of no return
Somebody saves me, and it happened again
Somebody saves me, and I thank you my friend
Somebody saves me, from a fate worse than heaven
'Cause if I blew it for a single moment
I'd blow it forever
But somebody saves me
I took up the connection once
Made me feel quite aloof
I never could queue to collect my lunch
While I was pursuing the truth
I left my folks in the mud and rain
It always rained in Sunnyside Road
I lived hippie jokes getting stoned insane
'Til the rain looked just like snow
But there was a soul in whom I could depend
He worked himself crazy while I laid in bed
I never leaned on a person like I leaned right then
And when I finally woke up clean
My friend was dead, stone dead
But somebody saved me, it happened again
Somebody saved me, I thank you my friend
Somebody saved me, I ain't ready for heaven
'Cause if I'd seen you for a second, I'd have wanted to see you forever
Somebody saved me
Somebody saved me
Somebody saved me
