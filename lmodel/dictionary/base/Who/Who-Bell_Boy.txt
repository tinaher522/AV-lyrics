Roger Daltrey:
A beach is a place where a man can feel
He's the only soul in the world that's real
But I see a face coming through the haze
I remember him from those crazy days
Ain't you the guy who used to set the paces
Riding up in front of a hundred faces
I don't suppose you would remember me
But I used to follow you back in '63
Keith Moon:
I've got a good job
And I'm newly born
You should see me dressed up in my uniform
I work in hotel, all gilt and flash
Remember the gaff where the doors were smashed?
Bell Boy! I've gotta get runnin' now
Bell Boy! Keep my lip buttoned down
Bell Boy! Carry this baggage out
Bell Boy! Always running at someone's bleeding heel
You know how I feel, always running at someone's heel
Some nights I still sleep on the beach
Remember when stars were in reach
Then I wander in early to work
Spend the day licking boots for my perks
Roger Daltrey:
A beach is a place where a man can feel
He's the only soul in the world that's real
But I see a face coming through the haze
I remember him from those crazy days
Ain't you the guy who used to set the paces
Riding up in front of a hundred faces
I don't suppose you would remember me
But I used to follow you back in '63
Keith Moon:
People often change, But when I look in your eyes
You could learn a lot, From a life like mine
The secret to me, It ain't flown like a flag
I carry it behind this bleedin' little badge, What says
Bell Boy! I've gotta get runnin' now
Bell Boy! Keep my lip buttoned down
Bell Boy! Carry this bloody baggage out
Bell Boy! Always running at someone's heel
You know how I feel, always running at someone's heel
