<song artist="Who" title="Faith_In_Something_Bigger">
It may be warm but the snow is going to fall
Enough to cover us all
We've gotta be strong men and follow a path again
We've got to have faith in something bigger
Faith in something bigger
Faith in something big inside ourself
It might be cold but the heat of our love will melt
The snow we never felt
We're young and hardy again, we bow to weaker men
We've got to have faith in something bigger
Faith in something bigger
Faith in something big inside ourself
The more we learn, the less we believe to be true
The more we prove, the more remains to be proved
We've gotta be strong men and follow a path again
We've got to have faith in something bigger
Faith in something bigger
Faith in something big inside ourself, inside ourself
Faith in something bigger
Faith in something bigger
Faith in something bigger
Faith in something bigger
Faith in something bigger
Faith in something bigger
Faith in something bigger
Faith in something bigger
