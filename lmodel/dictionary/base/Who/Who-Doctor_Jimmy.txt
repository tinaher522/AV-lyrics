<song artist="Who" title="Doctor_Jimmy">
Laugh and say I'm green
I've seen things you'll never see
Talk behind my back
But I'm off the beaten track
I'll take on anyone
Ain't scared of a bloody nose
Drink till I drop down
With one eye on my clothes
What is it? I'll take it
Who is she? I'll rape it
Got a bet there? I'll meet it
Getting high? You can't beat it
Doctor Jimmy and mister Jim
When I'm pilled you don't notice him
He only comes out when I drink my gin
You say she's a virgin
I'm gonna be the first in
Her fella's gonna kill me?
Oh fucking will he
I'm seeing double
But don't miss me if you can
There's gonna be trouble
When she choses her man
What is it? I'll take it
Who is she? I'll rape it
Got a bet there? I'll meet it
Getting high? You can't beat it
Doctor Jimmy and mister Jim
When I'm pilled you don't notice him
He only comes out when I drink my gin
Is it me? For a moment
The stars are falling
The heat is rising
The past is calling
I'm going back soon
Home to get the baboon
Who cut up my eye
Messed up my Levi's
I'm feeling restless
Bring another score around
Maybe something stronger
Could really hold me down
What is it? I'll take it
Who is she? I'll rape it
Got a bet there? I'll meet it
Getting high? You can't beat it
What is it? I'll take it
Who is she? I'll rape it
Doctor Jimmy and mister Jim
When I'm pilled you don't notice him
He only comes out when I drink my gin
Is it me? For a moment
The stars are falling
The heat is rising
The past is calling
