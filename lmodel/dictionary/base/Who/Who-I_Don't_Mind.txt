<song artist="Who" title="I_Don't_Mind">
I don't mind your love
I don't mind the one you're thinkin' of
I know, I know
You gonna miss me
I don't mind your love so sound
I don't mind, it can't go cold
I know, I know
You gonna miss me
I don't mind, it's the end of my song
I don't mind, good-bye, so long
I know, said, baby I know
You gonna miss me
