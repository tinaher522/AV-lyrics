Be lucky 
Be lucky 
Be lucky 
Be lucky some 
Be lucky 
Be lucky 
Be lucky 
Be lucky some 
Be lucky 
Be lucky 
Be lucky 
Be lucky some 
Be lucky 
Be lucky 
Be lucky 
Be lucky some 
Be lucky, gotta make it your own 
Get it from a bottle or squeeze it from a stone 
Might not remember the best way home 
But come December you won’t be alone 
Be lucky 
Better not forget, uh-oh 
Be lucky 
A very simple thing 
Be lucky 
Better make a bet, uh-oh 
Be lucky 
Or you might never win 
Be lucky, place your bet 
Can put it on a nag who ain't done nothing yet 
Make sure it was born in the Lambourn hills 
Then Kentucky Farm could pay your bills 
You wanna travel 'cross The Great Divide 
You really gotta have some luck on your side 
You wanna climb without a safety line 
AC/DC it's gonna be fine 
Be lucky 
Better not forget, uh-oh 
Be lucky 
A very simple thing 
Be lucky 
Better place a bet, uh-huh 
Be lucky 
Or you might never win 
If you wanna sell you got to kiss and tell 
Then you gotta do a cover of Highway To Hell 
If you wanna fight, if you need to bite 
Then you better get ready to rock through the night 
Be lucky, gotta make it your own 
Get it from a bottle, squeeze it from a stone 
Might not remember the best way home 
But come December you won’t be alone 
You wanna travel across The Great Divide 
You really gotta have some luck on your side 
You wanna climb without a safety line 
Daft Punk will tell you that it's gonna be fine 
"It's gonna be fine" 
Little Kylie is still on time 
"Go girl" 
"I'm here, I'm ready" 
Be lucky 
If you wanna hit just finish it 
Be Lucky 
Dress it up, laptop's hit 
Be lucky 
Sounds nice, my advice is 
Be lucky some 
Don't bet on paradises
