<song artist="Who" title="Black_Widow's_Eyes">
You jumped out of an alley
With surprise in your Black Widow's eyes
I was prepared to be unprepared
Been preparing for lies
I fell right in love with you
Into a thousand parts I blew
I fell right in love with you
I was caught in a corner
In recoil from a broken romance
Taking breath after one sudden death
I had a firm grip on my pants
I fell right in love with you
Through a hundred hearts you flew
I fell right in love with you
Strange that when infatuation calls
We think we've got real love in our life
It pumps like the pressure in a station hall
As the express-train thunders on by
I fell right in love with you
As the blood came blowing through
I fell right in love with you
Across the room, I saw your eyes
Black-windowed, looking back at me
You held a gun, as children cried
You touched some wires and shattered me
I was blown into a blue
There'd been nothing I could do
I fell right in love with you
I rose up to the station
Smelt your scent by the door
You stood waiting so patient
Just one wave - then no more
I fell right in love with you
There'd been nothing I could do
I fell right in love with you
Across the room, I saw your eyes
Black-windowed, looking back at me
You held a gun, as children cried
You touched some wires and shattered me
