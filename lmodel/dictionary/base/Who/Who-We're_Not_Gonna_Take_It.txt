Tommy:
Welcome to the camp,
I guess you all know why we're here.
My name is Tommy and I became aware this year
If you want to follow me,
You've got to play pinball.
And put in your earplugs
Put on your eyeshades
And you know where to put the cork!
Hey you gettin' drunk
So sorry, I've got you sussed.
Hey you smoking mother nature
You missed the bust
Hey hung up old mister normal,
Don't try to gain my trust
Cos you ain't gonna follow me
Any of those ways
Although you think you must!
Guests:
We're not gonna take it
We're not gonna take it
We're not gonna take it
We're not gonna take it
We're not gonna take it
Never did and never will
We're not gonna take it
Gonna break it!
Gonna shake it!
Let's forget it better still!
Tommy:
Now you can't hear me,
Your ears are truly sealed.
You can't speak either,
Your mouth is filled.
You can't see nothing,
And pinball completes the scene.
Here comes Uncle Ernie
To guide you to
Your very own machine.
Chorus:
We're not gonna take it!
We're not gonna take it!
We're not gonna take it!
We're not gonna take it!
We're not gonna take it!
Never did and never will
Don't want no religion
And as far as we can tell
We ain't gonna take you
Never did and never will
We ain't gonna take you
We forsake you!
Gonna rape you!
Let's forget you better still!
We forsake you!
Gonna rape you!
Let's forget you better still!
Tommy:
See me, feel me, touch me, heal me.
See me, feel me, touch me, heal me.
See me, feel me, touch me, heal me.
See me, feel me, touch me, heal me.
Listening to you, I get the music.
Gazing at you, I get the heat.
Following you, I climb the mountain.
I get excitement at your feet!
Right behind you, I see the millions.
On you, I see the glory.
From you, I get opinions.
From you, I get the story.
Listening to you, I get the music.
Gazing at you, I get the heat.
Following you, I climb the mountain.
I get excitement at your feet!
Right behind you, I see the millions.
On you, I see the glory.
From you, I get opinions.
From you, I get the story.
Listening to you, I get the music.
Gazing at you, I get the heat.
Following you, I climb the mountain.
I get excitement at your feet!
Right behind you, I see the millions.
On you, I see the glory.
From you, I get opinions.
From you, I get the story.
