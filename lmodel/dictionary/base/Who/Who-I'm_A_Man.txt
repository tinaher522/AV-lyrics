<song artist="Who" title="I'm_A_Man">
Now when I was a little boy
'Bout the age of five
I had something in my pocket
Keep a lot of folks alive
Now I'm a man
I'm age twenty-one
You know baby, we can have a lotta fun
I'm a man
I spell M-A-N
Man
All you pretty women
Stand in line
I can make love to you baby, in an hour's time
I'm a man
Spelled M-A-N
Man
I'm going back down
To Kansas to
Bring back the second cousin
Little John the conqueroo
I'm a man
Spelled M-A-N
Man
The line I shoot
Will never miss
The way I make love to 'em
They can't resist
I'm a man
I spell M-A-N
Man
