<song artist="Who" title="Young_Man_Blues">
Oh well a young man ain't got nothin' in the world these days
I said a young man ain't got nothin' in the world these days
You know in the old days
When a young man was a strong man
All the people they'd step back
When a young man walked by
But you know nowadays
It's the old man,
He's got all the money
And a young man ain't got nothin' in the world these days
I said nothing
Everybody knows that a young man ain't got nothin'
Everybody!
Everybody knows that a young man ain't got nothin'
He got nothin'
Nothin'
Take it easy on the young man
They ain't got nothin' in the world these days
I said they ain't got nothin'!
They got sweet fuck-all!
