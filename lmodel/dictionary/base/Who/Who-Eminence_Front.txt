<song artist="Who" title="Eminence_Front">
The sun shines and people forget
The spray flies as the speedboat glides, and people forget
Forget they're hiding
The girls smile and people forget
The snow packs as the skier tracks, and people forget
Forget they're hiding
Behind an eminence front
Eminence front, it's a put on
It's an eminence front
It's an eminence front, it's a put on
An eminence front
Eminence front, it's a put on, eminence front
It's an eminence front
It's an eminence front, it's a put on, it's a put on, it's a put on, it's a put on
Come and join the party, dressed to kill
Won't you come and join the party, dressed to kill
Dressed to kill
Drinks flow, people forget
That big wheel spins, the hair thins, people forget, forget they're hiding
The news slows, people forget
The shares crash, hopes are dashed, people forget
Forget they're hiding
Behind an eminence front
An eminence front, it's a put on
It's just an eminence front
An eminence front, it's a put on
An eminence front
An eminence front, it's a put on
Eminence front
It's an eminence front, it's a put on, it's a put on, it's a put on, it's a put on
Come and join the party, dressed to
Come and join the party, dressed to
Come on join the party, dressed to 
Come on join the party, dressed to kill
Dress yourself to kill
