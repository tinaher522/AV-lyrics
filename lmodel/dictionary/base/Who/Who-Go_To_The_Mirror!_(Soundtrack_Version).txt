The Specialist:
He seems to be completely unreceptive
The tests I gave him showed no sense at all
His eyes react to light, the dials detect it
He hears but cannot answer to your call
Tommy:
See me, feel me, touch me, heal me
See me, feel me, touch me, heal me
The Specialist:
There is no chance, no untried operation
All hope lies with him and none with me
Imagine though the shock from isolation
When he suddenly can hear and speak and see
Tommy:
See me, feel me, touch me, heal me
See me, feel me, touch me, heal me
The Specialist:
His eyes can see
His ears can hear, his lips speak
All the time the needles flick and rock
No machine can give the kind of stimulation
Needed to remove his inner block
Nora and Frank:
I often wonder what it is he's feeling
Has he ever heard a word I've said?
Look at him now in the mirror dreaming
What is happening in his head?
What is happening in his head?
I wish I knew, I wish I knew
