<song artist="Who" title="Too_Much_Of_Anything">
I think these hands have felt a lot
I don't know, what have I touched
I think these eyes have seen a lot
I don't know, maybe they've seen too much
I think this brain has thought a lot
Searching, trying to find the crutch
I think this heart has bled once too often
This time it's bled a bit too much
Too much of anything is too much for me
Too much of everything gets too much for me
I can't remember before '49
But I know '48 was there
My ears let in what I should speak out
Hmmm, there's something in the air
I've overloaded on my way
Bye bye, you better keep in touch
I think your ears hear a whole lot of music
And like me you've heard a bit too much
Too much of anything, is too much for me
Too much of everything gets too much for me
I think these hands have felt a lot
I don't know, what have I touched?
I think these eyes have seen a lot
I don't know, maybe they've seen too much
I think this brain has thought a lot
Searching, I've tried to find the crutch
I think this heart has bled once too often
This time it's bled a bit too much
Too much of anything, is too much for me
Too much of everything gets too much for me
