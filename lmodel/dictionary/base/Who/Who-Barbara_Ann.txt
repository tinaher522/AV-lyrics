<song artist="Who" title="Barbara_Ann">
Ba ba ba, ba Barbara Ann
Ba ba ba, ba Barbara Ann
Barbara Ann, take my hand, Barbara Ann
You've got me rockin' and a'rollin'
Rockin' and a'reelin' Barbara Ann
I went to a dance
Looking for romance
Saw Barbara Ann so I thought I'd take a chance
With Barbara Ann, Barbara Ann
You've got me rockin' and a'rollin'
Rockin' and a'reelin' Barbara Ann
Tried Mary Lou
Tried Peggy Sue
Tried Freddie too
But I knew she wouldn't do
Like Barbara Ann, Barbara Ann
You've got me rockin' and a'rollin'
Rockin' and a'reelin' Barbara Ann
Barbara Ann, Barbara Ann...
