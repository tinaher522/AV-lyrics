People try to put us d-d-d-down (Talkin' 'bout my favourite station)
Just because we're here in town (Talkin' 'bout my favourite station)
They said the BBC was dead and c-c-c-cold (Talkin' 'bout my favourite station)
But our new approach is fresh and bold (Talkin' 'bout my favourite station)
My favourite station
It's my favourite station, baby
Radio One!
"Alright, now let's hear the, the number from your, your latest record. Were you setting out to achieve anything particular with it?"
"We were trying to achieve the sound which we get on the stage at present, you know. Can't explain what's written as a sort of commercial number to introduce us to the charts. We just wanna try, get rid of all that, just show what we're tryin' to do, you know."
"Alright, fab, well, you show us now, will you?"
"Yeah?"
"And they, and they, you tell us the title, I'm bound to get it wrong."
"Anyway Anyhow Anywhere"
