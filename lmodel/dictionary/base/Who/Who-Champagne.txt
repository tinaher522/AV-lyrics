<song artist="Who" title="Champagne">
Nora:
Today it rained champagne
A son was born again
A genius unchained
A life of wealth and fame, wealth and fame
Champagne flowing down just like rain
Caviar breakfasts every day
Merchant banks and yachts at Cannes
Servants and cars and private sand
Tommy:
See me, feel me, touch me, heal me
See me, feel me, touch me, heal me, heal me
Nora:
They flock in thousands strong
We'll just play along
A million in reserve
For love, a just deserve, just deserve
Francs and dollars and peacock's wings
Sequined gowns and birds that sing
Private planes and fishing lakes
Bigger crowds and bigger, bigger, bigger takes
But what's it all worth?
What's it all worth when my son is blind?
He can't hear the music
Nor enjoy what I'm buying
His life is worthless
Affecting mine
I'd pay any price
To drive his plight from my mind
Tommy:
See me, feel me, touch me, heal me
See me, feel me, touch me, heal me
