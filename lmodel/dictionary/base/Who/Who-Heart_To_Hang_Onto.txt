<song artist="Who" title="Heart_To_Hang_Onto">
Johnny boy, he's always propping up the bar
He's sees life crystallized through his jar
He says he only lives for beer
But deep in his heart is a cry of fear
Give me a heart to hang onto
Give me a soul that's tailored new
Give me a heart to hang onto
A heart to hang onto
Sally seems to get bigger everyday
She evens out in a contented way
A finger on the pulse of every guy
But deep in the night you can hear her cry
Give me a heart to hang onto
Give me a life that's tailored new
Give me a heart to hang onto
Oh please a heart to hang onto
Give me heart to hang onto
Give me a soul that's tailored new
Give me a heart to hang onto, ooh yeah 
Give me a heart to hang onto, oo-ooh 
Danny, he wants to save for a new guitar
He's going to learn to play but he won't get far
He thinks it's an easy going' high
But his whole life is just another try
Give me a heart to hang onto
Give me a suit that's tailored true
Give me a heart to hang onto
A heart to hang on...
Oo-oh yeah 
I need a heart... to hang onto...
