<song artist="Who" title="1921">
I've got a feeling twenty one
Is going to be a good year.
Especially if you and me
See it in together.
Father:
So you think twenty one is going to be a good year.
It could be for me and her,
But you and her - no never!
I had no reason to be over optimistic,
But somehow when you smiled
I could brave bad weather
Mother:
What about the boy?
What about the boy?
What about the boy?
He saw it all!
Mother &amp; Father:
You didn't hear it.
You didn't see it.
You won't say nothing to no one
Never in your life.
You never heard it,
Oh, how absurd it
All seems without any proof.
You didn't hear it.
You didn't see it.
You never heard it not a word of it.
You won't say nothing to no one.
Never tell a soul
What you know is the Truth.
