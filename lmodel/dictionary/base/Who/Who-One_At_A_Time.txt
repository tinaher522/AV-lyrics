<song artist="Who" title="One_At_A_Time">
One at a time
Always ready to fight over the little things
One at a time
She's always ready to fight over the little things
She's going crazy and the table starts shakin'
She's been abusin' her body again
Her vision gets hazy and the bottles start breakin'
She's been seeing that man again
If you want her, you can keep her
'Cause I can only handle one at a time
You can take her
I've got someone waitin' in line
And I'd like to
But I can only handle one at a time
One at a time
I found out she's continually cheatin'
She insists, she's so innocent
So I stayed out at another late meeting
And she waited up for another argument
If you want her, you can keep her
'Cause I can only handle one at a time
You can take her
I've got someone waitin' in line
And I'd like to
But I can only handle one at a time
One at a time
I'm moving on to something better
There must be something better than this
She's got me so confused
As to who's being used
Call her up right away
You've got her number
And I promise not to answer the phone
You can pick her up in your clapped out Humber
I just hope it can get you home
If you want her, you can keep her
'Cause I can only handle one at a time
You can take her
I've got someone waitin' in line
And I'd like to
But I can only handle one at a time
One at a time
One at a time
One at a time
One at a time
One at a time
One at a time
