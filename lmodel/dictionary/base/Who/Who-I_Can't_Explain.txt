<song artist="Who" title="I_Can't_Explain">
Got a feeling inside
Can't explain
It's a certain kind
Can't explain
I feel hot and cold
Can't explain
Way down in my soul, yeah
Can't explain
I said
Can't explain
I'm feelin' good now yeah but
Can't explain
Dizzy in the head and I'm feelin' blue
The things you've said well maybe they're true
I'm gettin' funny dreams again and again
I know what it means but
Can't explain
Think it's love
Try to say it to you
When I feel blue
But I can't explain
Can't explain
Yeah hear what I'm sayin' girl
Can't explain
Dizzy in the head and I'm feelin' bad
The things you've said have got me real mad
I'm gettin' funny dreams again and again
I know what it means but
Can't explain
Think it's love
Try to say it to you
When I feel blue
But I can't explain
Can't explain
Forgive me one more time now
Can't explain
I said I can't explain, yeah
You drive me out of my mind
Yeah I'm the worrying kind, babe
I said I can't explain
