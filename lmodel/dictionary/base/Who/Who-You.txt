<song artist="Who" title="You">
You - you're wasting my time
We're making music we're doing fine
Then a slap in the face takes me back to the starting line
You - your wasting my life
You can't lose what you've already lost
Your arms are open but your legs are crossed
Save me - save me
I'm going down for the third time
Save me - save me
Somebody throw me my next line
Too hot for me to handle
So cold I'm getting nowhere
Pinch me to see if I'm sleeping
Maybe it's only a nightmare
You - why did it have to be you?
Of all those girls I had to choose
You win and I lose
You - you with the poisonous eyes
One look and I'm hooked
One touch and my goose is cooked
Save me - save me
I'm going down for the third time
Save me - save me
Somebody throw me a life line
Too late to change partners
Too late you've got no chance
Too late to change partners
Too late to say I don't dance
You - there's a name for girls like you
You lead me on like a lamb to the slaughter
Then you act like a fish out of water
You - there's a name for girls like you
You've coming on like a steam train
Then you blow me away just like a hurricane
Save me - save me
I'm going down for the last time
Save me - save me
Somebody throw me a lifeline
Save me I'm falling
From the top of the page to the next line
Save me I'm burning
From tips of my toes to my hairline
Too hot for me to handle
So cold I'm getting nowhere
Pinch me to see if I'm sleeping
Maybe it's only a nightmare
