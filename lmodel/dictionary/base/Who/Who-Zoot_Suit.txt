<song artist="Who" title="Zoot_Suit">
I'm the hippiest number in town and I'll tell you why
I'm the snappiest dresser right down to my inch wide tie
And to get you wise I'll explain it to you
A few of the things that a face is supposed to do
I wear zoot suit jacket with side vents five inches long
I have two-tone brogues yeah you know this is wrong
But the main thing is unless you're a fool
Ah you know you gotta know, yeah you know, yeah you gotta be cool
So all you tickets I just want you to dig me
With my striped zoot jacket that the sods can plainly see
So the action lies with all of you guys
Is how you look in the other, the other, yeah, the other cat's eye
Well don't you see, well don't you see, well don't you see now
Well don't you see now, come on baby, 'cause don't you see now, oh baby
Well don't you see now, you drive me wild, hmm hmm hmm, you're crazy-looking now
