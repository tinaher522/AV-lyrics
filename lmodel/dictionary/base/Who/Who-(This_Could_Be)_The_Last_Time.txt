<song artist="Who" title="(This_Could_Be)_The_Last_Time">
I told you once and I told you twice
But you never listen to my advice
You don't try very hard to please me
With what you know that should come easy
This could be the last time
This could be the last time
Maybe the last time
I don't know
I'm sorry girl but I can't stay
Feeling like I do today
Too much pain, Too much sorrow
I guess I'll feel the same tomorrow
This could be the last time
This could be the last time
Maybe the last time
I don't know
I told you once and I told you twice
Someone has to pay the price
Now's your chance to change your mind
Cause I've been gone a long long time
This could be the last time
This could be the last time
Maybe the last time
I don't know
