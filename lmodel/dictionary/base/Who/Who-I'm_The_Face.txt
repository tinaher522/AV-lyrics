<song artist="Who" title="I'm_The_Face">
I'm the face, baby, is that clear?
I'm the face, baby, is that clear?
I'm the face if you want it
I'm the face if you want it, dear
All the others are third class tickets by me, baby, is that clear?
I'm the big wheel, baby, won't you roll with me?
I'm the big wheel, baby, won't you roll with me?
So many cats down the scene, honey
Little hard to see
Wear ivy league jackets, white buckskin shoes
I wear ivy league jackets, white buckskin shoes
So many tickets down the scene, honey
They're like to blow a fuse
I'm the face, baby, is that clear?
I'm the face, baby, is that clear?
I'm the face if you want it
I'm the face if you want it, dear
All the others are third class tickets by me, baby, is that clear?
