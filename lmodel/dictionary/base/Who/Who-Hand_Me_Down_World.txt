<song artist="Who" title="Hand_Me_Down_World">
Someday they'll find your small town world on a big town avenue
Gonna make you like the way they talk when they're talking to you
Gonna make you break out of the shell cause they tell you to
Gonna make you like the way they lie better than the truth
They'll tell you everything you wanted someone else to say
They're gonna break your heart, yeah
From what I've seen, you're just one more hand me down
Cause no one's tried to give you what you need
So lay all your troubles down, I am with you now
Somebody ought to take you in, try to make you love again
Try to make you like the way they feel when they're under your skin
Never once did you think they would lie when they're holding you
You wonder why they haven't called when they said they'd call you
You start to wonder if you're ever gonna make it by
You'll start to think you were born blind
From what I've seen, you're just one more hand me down
Cause no one's tried to give you what you need
So lay all your troubles down, I am with you now
I'm here for the hard times, the straight to your heart times
When livin' ain't easy, you can stand up against me
And baby rely on me and cry on me, yeah
Some day they'll open up your world, shake it down to the drawing board
Do their best to change you, they still can't erase you
From what I've seen, you're just one more hand me down
Cause no one's tried to give you what you need
So lay all your troubles down, I am with you now
Lay them down on me, oh yeah
You're just one more hand me down
And all those nights don't give you what you need
So lay all your troubles down on me
