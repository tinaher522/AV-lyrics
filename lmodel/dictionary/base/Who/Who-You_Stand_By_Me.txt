<song artist="Who" title="You_Stand_By_Me">
When I'm in trouble
You stand by me
When I see double
You stand by me
You take my side
Against those who lied
You take my side
Gimme back my pride
When I been losing
You stand by me
When I been boozin'
You stand by me
You take my side
Against those who lied
You take my side
Gimme back my pride
I suppose I could make it all my own
I know I'd arrive all skin and all bone
You are the strongest back I've ever known
You carried me, carried me, carried me
You carried me home
When I'm crying
You stand by me
When I am dying
You stand by me
