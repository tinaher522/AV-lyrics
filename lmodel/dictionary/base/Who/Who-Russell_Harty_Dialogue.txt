RUSSELL HARTY:
I want one thing that you did before you joined as a group. Pete.
KEITH MOON:
I, uh, was a rust repairer. I was a rust repairer and full time survivor. I survived all the, uh, major earthquakes. And uh, and the Titanic, and several air crashes.
RUSSELL HARTY:
I think you'll have to give me a few lessons in survival.
