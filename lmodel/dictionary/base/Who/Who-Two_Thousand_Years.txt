<song artist="Who" title="Two_Thousand_Years">
Two thousand years
Two thousand years
Two thousand years
Two thousand years
Have I waited
To ask if I have loved you
To know if I have served you
To find if I've obeyed you
To know if I've betrayed you
Two thousand years
Two thousand years
Two thousand years
Two thousand years
Two thousand years
Have I waited
Then find I can't be perfect
Not even a perfect snake
To know that we are hated
You suffer for my sake
Two thousand years
Two thousand years
Two thousand years
Two thousand years
Have I waited
And so I have a chance to love
As you intended
You really lived and die for me
Is the waiting really ended?
Two thousand years
Two thousand long, long years
Two thousand years
Two thousand long, long years
Have I waited
