<song artist="Who" title="Real_Good_Looking_Boy">
When I think back to the first time in my childhood
When I saw that face I thought right then
"That's a real good looking boy"
I saw myself in the mirror
In profile for the first time I thought, "Hey!
That's a real good looking boy"
And I felt then that I moved
With all those lucky fucks and angels
High in the theatre in the sky
So I went to my mother I said
"Hey mom, take look at me"
Have you ever seen a teen fly so high?
That's a real good looking boy
That's a real good looking boy
She said, "Son, well, you know
You're ugly boy
You don't really look like him
In this long line there's been some
Real strange genes
You got 'em all, you got 'em all
With some extras thrown in"
That's a real good looking boy
That's a real good looking boy
That's a real good looking boy
That's a real good looking boy
Wise men say
Only fools, only fools rush in
But I, I can't help
Falling in love, in love with you
Now I'm here with you little darling
And you say, "You're beautiful as you are"
And I've managed somehow to survive
You arrived in my life like a fragrance
You helped me find a way to laugh
And now I know how so-called beauty lies
God gave him a face
Then he gave me something above
God gave me grace
Then he gave me your sweet, sweet, sweet love
You make me feel like a real good looking boy
I feel like a real good looking boy
That's a real good looking boy
That's a real good looking boy
