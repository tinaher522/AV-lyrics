(Good lovin')
(Good lovin')
(Good lovin')
(Good lovin')
When I'm feelin', so bad
I asked the family's doctor what I had
I said, doctor (Doctor, doctor)
Mr. M.D. (Doctor, doctor)
Come on, tell me, what's ailing me (Doctor, doctor)
He said "yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah"
Need, all I need
(Good lovin') All I need is love
(Good lovin') Good good lovin', girl
(Good lovin') All I need is lovin'
(Good lovin') Give me your lovin', girl, yeah
Come on baby (Come on baby)
Squeeze me tight (Squeeze me tight)
You want your lovin' man to be alright (Be alright)
I said baby (Baby, baby)
That's for sure (Baby, baby)
I got a fever
You got the cure (Baby, baby)
She said "yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah"
Yes indeed, all I need
(Good lovin') All I need is love
(Good lovin') Good good lovin', child
(Good lovin') Give me your lovin', baby
(Good lovin') All I need now girl, is yeah
