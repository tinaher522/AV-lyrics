Narrator:
Now he is deaf
Now he is dumb
Now he is blind
The guilty are safe
But always accused by his empty eyes
Nothing to say, nothing to hear, and nothing to see
Each sensation makes a note
In his symphony
Sickness will surely take the mind
Where minds can't usually go
Come on the amazing journey
And learn all you should know
A vague haze of delirium creeps up on him
Soaring and flying images spin
He is your leader, he is your guide
On the amazing journey
Together you'll ride
Sickness will surely take the mind
Where minds can't usually go
Come on the amazing journey
And learn all you should know
His eyes are the eyes that
Transmit all they know
The Truth burns so bright it can melt winter snow
A towering shadow so black and so high
A white sun burning the earth and the sky
