<song artist="Who" title="Pure_And_Easy">
There once was a note
Pure and easy
Playin' so free, like a breath rippling by
The note is eternal
I hear it it sees me
Forever we blend
And forever we die
I listened and I heard
Music in a word
And words when you played your guitar
The noise that I was hearing was a million people cheering
And a child flew past me riding in a star
As people assemble
Civilization
Is trying to find a new way to die
But killing is really
Merely scene changer
All men are bored
With other men's lies
I listened and I heard
Music in a word
And words when you played your guitar
The noise I was hearing was a million people cheering
And a child flew past me riding in a star
Gas on the hillside
Oil in the teacup
Watch all the chords of life lose their joy
Distortion becomes somehow
Pure in its wildness
The note that began all
Can also destroy
We all know success
When we all find our own dreams
And our love is enough
To knock down any walls
And the future's been seen
As men try to realize
The simple secret of the note in us all
I listened and I heard
Music in a word
And words when you played your guitar
The noise I was hearing was a million people cheering
And a child flew past me riding in a star
There once was a note
Pure and easy
Playing so free, like a breath rippling by
There once was a note
Listen
(repeat 18 times)
