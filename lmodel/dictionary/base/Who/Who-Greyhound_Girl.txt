<song artist="Who" title="Greyhound_Girl">
Each time we come here 
I see we'll never come here again 
Each time we make love 
I say we'll never make love again
 
But, my little greyhound girl 
You got me running, down the flat 
But, my little greyhound girl 
I'm in your dreams
Each time we ride out 
I say we'll never ride out again 
And, when we kiss 
I say we'll never, never kiss again 
But, my little greyhound girl 
You got me running down the flat 
My little greyhound girl I'm in your dreams
I'm looking for reasons 
I'm looking for reasons
But there ain't a why or a where for to live around my little greyhound girl 
You've got me running, down the flat 
My little greyhound girl 
I'm in your track
