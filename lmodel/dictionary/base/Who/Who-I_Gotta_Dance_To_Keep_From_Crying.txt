<song artist="Who" title="I_Gotta_Dance_To_Keep_From_Crying">
Gather 'round my swingin' beers
Help me forget my hopeful tears 
About the only girl I
I gotta dance to keep from cryin' (crying) 
Gotta dance to keep from crying' (crying) 
Whoa, do the flop (The flop) 
Do the twist (The twist) 
Everybody, it goes like this 
You gotta dance, got me swayin', got it, alright 
Gotta dance, got me swayin', got it, alright 
I'm so lonely since we parted 
You memory leaves me so broken hearted 
I gotta dance to keep from cryin' (crying) 
Gotta dance to keep from cryin' (crying) 
Do the bird (do the bird) 
Do the fly (do the fly) 
Come on, gang, you know, by by by, oh yeah 
Do the bang, yeah, you can't miss 
Everybody, yeah, it goes like this 
You gotta dance, got me swayin', got it, alright 
Gotta dance, got me swayin', got it, alright 
Heartaches can gather 'round 
Misery I sure have found 
I gotta dance to keep from cryin' (crying) 
Gotta dance to keep from crying' (crying) 
You goin' softer now, you goin' softer now... 
You goin' soft right now, yeah yeah 
Everybody clap their hands now... 
Alright, yeah, alright, yeah 
I want you to go harder now, baby 
I want you to go harder now, baby 
Yeah yeah, you go harder now 
You walk right up, yeah yeah 
You go harder now, yeah... 
You go hard now, yeah... 
You gotta dance, got me swayin', got it, alright 
Gotta dance, got me swayin', got it, alright 
You gotta dance, got me swayin', got it, alright 
Gotta dance, got me swayin', got it, alright
You got me swaying, you know it's alright
