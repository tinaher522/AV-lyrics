<song artist="Who" title="Trying_To_Get_Through">
Trying to get through, going to just sit and smile
Trying to get to you, but it's once in awhile
Trying to get through, get through, get through
How could they fear, turn a blind eye
Pack up the sun, 'cause they see I'm tryin'
To get through, get through, get through
Are you really mine, or are you my scene
If I teach you now, do you think you could please
I'm trying to get through, get through, keep on goin', yeah
