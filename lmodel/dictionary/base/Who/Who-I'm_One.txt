<song artist="Who" title="I'm_One">
Every year it's the same
And I feel it again
I'm a loser - no chance to win
Leaves start falling
Comedown is calling
Loneliness starts sinking in
But I'm one
I'm one
And I can see
That this is me
And I will be
You'll all see that
I'm the one
Where do you get those blue blue jeans
Faded, patch secret so tight
Where do you get that walk oh-so lean
Your shoes and your shirt all just right
But I'm one
I'm one
And I can see
That this is me
And I will be
You'll all see that
I'm the one
I got a Gibson without a case
But I can't get that even tanned look on my face
Ill fitting clothes and I blend in the crowd
Fingers so clumsy
Voice too loud
But I'm one
I'm one
And I can see
That this is me
And I will be
You'll all see that
I'm the one
I'm the one
Yeah, I'm the one
