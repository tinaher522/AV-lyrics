Good morning, converts!
I'm your brother Ernie and I welcome you to Tommy's Holiday Camp
The camp with the difference
Never mind the weather
When you come to Tommy's, the holiday's forever
Welcome!
Get your Tommy t-shirts and your stickers
And your Tommy mirrors to smash
Don't rush, keep steady
Have your money ready
Buy your way to heaven
That comes to one pound seven
Bless your, love
Buy your shades and earplugs
Keep in line, I've got a huge supply
Get your Tommy record
You can really hear him talk
Tommy pics and badges
Half a knicker for the cork
You lucky people
The camp with the difference
Never mind the weather
When you come to Tommy's, the holiday's forever
