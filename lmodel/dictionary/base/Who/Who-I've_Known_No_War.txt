<song artist="Who" title="I've_Known_No_War">
I've known no war
And if I ever do I won't know for sure
Who'll be fighting whom
For the soldiers lonely tomb
Now it's over as soon as the referee's gun starts to roar
I'll know no war, I've never known war
Galbraith took his pen
To break down the men
Of the German army defeated
On the nineteenth day
Of a spring day in May
Albert Speer was deleted
And as soon as the battle was over
I was born in victorious clover
And I've never been shot at or gassed
Never tortured or stabbed
And I'm sure I'll never know war
No, I'll never know war, no no no
I know I'll never know war
And if I ever do, the glimpse will be short
Fireball in the sky
No front line battle cries
Can be heard as the button is pushed
By a soul that's been bought
I'll know no war
No, I'll know no war
In and out of reach loft
The medals are lost
They belong to a lone broken sailor
His provinces now
In the bars of the town
His songs and his poems of failure
For his grandchildren can't see the glory
And his own kids are bored with the story
But for him they'd have burned behind netting
From the brink they were grabbed
And I'm sure I'll never know war
I'll never know war
I'll know no war
And if I ever do I won't know for sure
Who'll be fighting whom
For the soldiers lonely tomb
Now it's over as soon as the referee's gun starts to roar
I'll know no war
War, I've known no war
I'll never know war
And if I ever know it
The glimpse will be short
Fireball in the sky
No front line battle cries
Can be heard as the button is pushed by a soul that's been bought
And the armies remaining will judge without people or courts
And there's no point pretending that knowing will help us abort
I'll know no war
