Converts:
These pricy deals don't teach us
Your freedom doesn't reach us
Enlightenment escapes us
Awareness doesn't shape us
How can all this trivia
Take us to the goal you reached?
We came here to be like you
And find the world you preached!
These pricy deals don't teach us
Your freedom doesn't reach us
Enlightenment escapes us
Awareness doesn't shape us
How can all this trivia
Take us to the goal you reached?
We came here to be like you
And find the world you preached!
Tommy:
Welcome to the camp
I guess you all know why we're here
My name is Tommy and I became aware this year
If you want to follow me
You've got to play pinball
And put in your earplugs
Put on your eye shades
You know where to put the cork
Hey you, gettin' drunk
So sorry, I got you sussed
Hey you smokin' mother nature
You missed the bus
Hey, hung up old mister normal
Don't try to gain my trust
'Cause you ain't gonna follow me
Any of those ways
Although you think you must
Now you can't hear me
Your ears are truly sealed
You can't speak either
'Cause your mouth is filled
You can't see nothing
And pinball completes the scene
Here come willing helpers
To guide you to
Your very own machines
Converts:
We're not gonna take it
We're not gonna take it
We're not gonna take it
We're not gonna take it
We're not gonna take it
Never did and never will
We don't have to take it
Gonna break it
Gonna shake it
Let's forget it better still
We're not gonna take it
We're not gonna take it
We're not gonna take it
We're not gonna take it
We're not gonna take it
Never did and never will
Don't want no religion
As far as we can tell
We ain't gonna take you
Never did and never will
We're not gonna take you
We forsake you
Gonna rape you
Let's forget you better still
