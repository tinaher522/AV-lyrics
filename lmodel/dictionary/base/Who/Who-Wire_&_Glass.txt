I. Sound Round
I'm young in my camper van
The world feels old and new
I fear the future man
As I take in the view
Don't know where to head now
Give up? Go back?
My friends are all dead now
Or stifled in the sack
Sound round,
Feel the ground
Feel the pulse
We have found
Breathe in
Feel the spin
Where's the dream
That we were in?
Sound round,
Feel the ground
Feel the pulse
We have found
Sound round,
Feel the ground
Feel the pulse
We have found
Breathe in
Feel the spin
Where's the dream
That we were in?
Sound round,
Feel the ground
Feel the pulse
We have found
I'm young in my camper van
The world feels old and new
I fear the future man
As I take in the view

II. Pick Up the Peace
Now I'm in the ether
Look down at time
I see three children
Prepare to walk the line
I see them older
When life is done
I was a loser
At the game they won
Come on let's try
To pick up the peace
You and I
On our hands and knees
Come on let's try
To pick up, pick up the peace
Come on let's try
To touch the Fleece
You and I
On our hands and knees
Come on let's try
To pick up, pick up the peace
How do old people forget
That the wars we've seen
Are 'bout me longing for you
You longing for me?

III. Unholy Trinity
Three kids from the neighborhood
Three different lives
Three different ways to be
Three identical smiles
We're not the same
But we can talk
We kiss and link our arms
We take a walk
We watch the tide ebb way
Carry our ides to the sea
We hear the music
Remember being free
We are unholy
Trinity
In love forever
We are the sea
We are the ocean
We are the free
We are unholy
Trinity

IV. Trilby's Piano
Your mother loves her brother
But her brother loves his lover
And his lover is my cover
My one and only other - my angel
My angel Trilby
Who said I will be
What I should still be
Genius would fill me - she loves Hymie
Only one Hymie
No one else on earth could ever blind me - like this
Or even find me - such bliss
If you were gone
You'd still be here
Only one Hymie
Why can't they see that life excites me
This boy ignites me
His family fights me
But he's still here
Only one Hymie...

V. Endless Wire
We found this pile of paper
Written by that ether man
He hatched a mad old caper
He had a mad old plan
He'd turn us into music
He'd show us to our portals
He gathered wire and angels
To entertain immortals
Out on the endless, endless
Out on the endless wire
Out on the endless, endless
Out on the endless wire

VI. Fragments of Fragments
Are we breathing out
Or breathing in
Are we leaving life
Or moving on
Are we breathing out
Or breathing in
Are we breathing in
We are tiny pieces
Falling now and settling
Like snowflake crystal
Building on the city street
Snowflakes falling
Snowflakes falling
Snowflakes falling
Snowflakes falling
Are we the parts
Are we the whole
Are we the thoughts
Are we the soul
The parts of me
And this is true
The parts of me
Belong to you
Breathing out
Breathing in
Breathing out
Breathing in
Breathing out
Breathing in
Belong to you
And you
And you
And you...

VII. We Got a Hit
We got our folks together
We broke down barriers
We found a dream to dream
We were the carriers
We got rich and famous
Papers at our door
We talked a load of crap
They wanted more
We got a hit
Good news, we got a hit
We got a hit
Good news, we got a hit
We got a hit
We got a hit...
We got our folks together
We broke down barriers
We found a dream to dream
We were the carriers
We got a hit
Good news, we got a hit
We got a hit
Good news

VIII. They Made My Dream Come True
People died where I performed
People cried when Glass deformed
Shots rang out as the singer yawned
The band played on until the dawn
Lies and drunks and drugs and fools
Tricks and stunts disguise the tools
Was the victim dead, was there blood in pools
Was this not part of show-biz rules?
They made my dream come true
They made my dream come true
They made my dream come true

IX. Mirror Door
If you don't hear me, how can I tell you
If you don't listen, why should I speak
If you're indifferent, how can I reach you
Just 'cos you're angry don't assume I'm weak
Howling Wolf and old Link Wray
Dave Van Ronk and Doris Day
Bobby Darin, Brownie McGhee
Elvis, Buddy and Eddie C
Music makes me, makes me strong
Strong vibrations, make me long
Long for a place where I belong
You will find me in this song
Who will walk through the mirror door
Will there be music, or will there be war
Will we be rich, or will we be poor
Who will walk through the mirror door
Who will walk through the mirror door
Will there be music, or will there be war
Will we be rich, or will we be poor
Who will walk through the mirror door
A thousand angels, a million children
Fire and fear in a suicide eye
Golden stairway to a Zeppelin heaven
Rolling thunder under New York sky
Frank 'n' Ella, Ray 'What'd I Say'
Johnny Cash and Johnnie Ray
Amadeus and Ludvig Van
Henry, Johann and the Doo-Dah Band
We are here in celebration
This music's gonna make us strong
We climb up high, to the golden station
Curtis Mayfield ain't waiting long
Get on board...
Who will walk through the mirror door
Will there be music, or will there be war
Will we be rich, or will we be poor
Who will walk through the mirror door
Who will walk through the mirror door
Will there be music, or will there be war
Will we be rich, or will we be poor
Who will walk through the mirror door
Howling Wolf and old Link Wray
Dave Van Ronk and Doris Day
Bobby Darin, Brownie McGhee
Elvis, Buddy and Eddie C
Frank 'n' Ella, Ray 'What'd I Say'
Johnny Cash and Johnnie Ray
Amadeus and Ludvig Van
Henry, Johann and the Doo-Dah Band
Keep on climbing
