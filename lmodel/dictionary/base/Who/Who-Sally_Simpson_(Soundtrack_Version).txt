Narrator:
Outside the house Mr. Simpson announced
That Sally couldn't go to the meeting
He went on cleaning his black Rolls Royce
And she ran inside weeping
She got to her room and tears splashed the picture
Of the new Messiah
She picked up a book of her father's life
And threw it on the fire
She knew from the start
Deep down in her heart
That she and Tommy were worlds apart
But her mother said, "Never mind, your part
Is to be what you'll be"
The theme of the sermon was "Come Unto Me"
Love will find a way
So Sally decided to ignore her Dad
And sneak out anyway
She spent all afternoon getting ready
And decided she'd try to touch him
Maybe he'd see that she was free
And talk to her this Sunday
She knew from the start
Deep down in her heart
That she and Tommy were worlds apart
But her mother said, "Never mind, your part
Is to be what you'll be"
She arrived at six and the place was swingin'
To gospel music by nine
Group after group appeared on the stage
And Sally just sat there crying
She bit her nails looking pretty as a picture
Right in the very front row
And then one of the faithful came on stage
And shouted, "Here we go!"
The crowd went crazy
As Tommy hit the stage
Little Sally got lost as the police bossed
The crowd back in a rage
Tommy:
Your happy welcome is like a favour
I must now return
The darkness of my childhood passed
And flames of blood now burn
The pinball game I play so well
Reflects a way of life
This meeting is just another game
Let's play to win, tonight
Narrator:
She knew from the start
Deep down in her heart
That she and Tommy were worlds apart
But her mother said, "Never mind, your part
Is to be what you'll be"
Her cheek hit a chair and blood trickled down
Mingling with her tears
Tommy:
Try to walk the path I walked
Never mind the pain and fear
Each one of you has freedom
In your heart, without my grace
Let me see you raise your hands
See joy upon your face
Narrator:
The crowd went crazy
As Tommy left the stage
Little Sally was lost for the price of a touch
And a gash across her face
Her pretty face!
Sixteen stitches put her right and her Dad said
"Don't say I didn't warn yer"
Sally got married to a rock musician
Who came from California
Tommy always talks about the day
The disciples all went wild
Sally still carries a scar on her cheek
To remind her of his smile
She knew from the start
Deep down in her heart
That she and Tommy were worlds apart
But her mother said, "Never mind, your part
Is to be what you'll be"
