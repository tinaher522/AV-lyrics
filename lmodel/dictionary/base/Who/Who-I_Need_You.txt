<song artist="Who" title="I_Need_You">
Knowing
Is what people tell you
That you're thinking wrong
Embrace you
But they really mean some harm
You talk to them, they laugh aloud
Yet they'll run to you in any crowd
Please talk to me again
I need you
We're dancing
We will come and dance near you
We want to learn
Let us come and sitar with you
Distort my ears when the music's loud
Did you raise your head in the yellow crowd
Please talk to me again
I need you
(Assorted speeches)
Knowing
Is what people tell you
That you're thinking wrong
Embrace you
But they really mean some harm
You talk to them, they laugh aloud
Yet they'll run to you in any crowd
Please talk to me again
I need you
