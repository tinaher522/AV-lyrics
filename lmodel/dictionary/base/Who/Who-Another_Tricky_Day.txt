<song artist="Who" title="Another_Tricky_Day">
You can't always get it
When you really want it
You can't always get it at all
Just because there's space
In your life it's a waste
To spend your time why don't you wait for the call?
Just gotta get used to it
We all get it in the end
Just gotta get used to it
We go down and we come up again
Just gotta get used to it
You irritate me my friend
This is no social crisis
This is you havin' fun
No crisis
Gettin' burned by the sun
This is true
This is no social crisis
Just another tricky day for you
You can't always get higher
Just because you aspire
You could expire even knowin'
Don't push the hands
Just hang on to the band
And you can dance while your knowledge is growing
It could happen anytime
You can't expect to never cry
Patience is priceless
Not when you try to fly so high
Just stay on that line
Rock 'n roll will never die
This is no social crisis
This is you havin' fun
No crisis
Gettin' burned by the sun
This is true
This is no social crisis
Just another tricky day for you
Another tricky day
Another gently nagging pain
What the papers say
Just seems to bring down heavier rain
The world seems in a spiral
Life seems such a worthless title
But break out and start a fire y'all
It's all here on the vinyl
No crisis
Just you havin' fun
There's no crisis
Gettin' burned by the sun
Got no crisis, this is true
This is no social crisis
Just another tricky day for you
You can't always get it
When you really want it
You can't always get it at all
Just because there's space
In your life it's a waste
To spend your time why don't you wait for the call?
Just gotta get used to it
Gotta get used to waiting
Just gotta get used to it
You know how the ice is
Just gotta get used to it
It's thin where you're skating
This is no social crisis
This is you havin' fun
No crisis
Gettin' burned by the sun
This is true
This is no social crisis
Just another tricky day for you
Fella
Just another tricky day
For you
Just another tricky day
For you
Just another tricky day
Just another tricky day
For you
You'll get through
