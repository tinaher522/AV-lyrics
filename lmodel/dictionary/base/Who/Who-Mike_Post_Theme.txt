<song artist="Who" title="Mike_Post_Theme">
We're not strong enough
We're not young enough
We're not alone enough, or cold enough
Emotionally we're not even old enough
Late at night, we're in a video-game dream
There is no lover in this numbered scene
We summon every childhood ghost we've ever seen
Then suddenly we hear that Mike Post theme
Everything is all right (bong de bong)
We've prayed today (la-da-da-da-dah)
Everything is OK (bong de bong)
We've played today
Late at night on the underground train
Through endless suburbs in endless pain
Then deep in the tunnel under the London rain
Suddenly we hear Mike Post again
Everything is all right (bong de bong)
We've prayed today (la-da-da-da-dah)
If there really is a God (bong de bong)
We should be laid today
We watch those films
That make men cry
Young lovers kiss
Then fight and die
We start to yearn
We climb the vine
We have to face
The truth some time
We're not strong enough
We're not young enough
We're not alone enough, or cold enough
Emotionally we're not even old enough
For love...
But late at night we find the racing tame
We're faced with women and a reality game
We feel alive; we feel new and blind
We're hearing Mike Post in the air this time
Everything is all right (bong de bong)
We've prayed today (la-da-da-da-dah)
If there really is a God (bong de bong)
We should get laid today
There comes a time in every little punk's life
Where he has to right a song for his common-law wife
We make our women wait until they wanna scream
But we can always whistle that Mike Post theme
Everything is all right (bong de bong)
We've prayed today (la-da-da-da-dah)
If there really is a God (bong de bong)
We should get laid today
We watch those films
That make men cry
Young lovers kiss
Then fight and die
We start to yearn
We climb the vine
We have to face
The truth some time
