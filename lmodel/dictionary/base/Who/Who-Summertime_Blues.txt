<song artist="Who" title="Summertime_Blues">
Well, I'm a'gonna raise a fuss
I'm a'gonna raise a holler
I've been working all summer
Just to try and earn a dollar
Well went to the boss
(Said girl for a date??)
The boss said "No dice, son, you gotta work late"
Sometimes I wonder what I'm a'gonna do
There ain't no cure for the summertime blues
Well my mom and poppa told me
"Son you gotta earn some money
If you wanna use the car
To go ridin' next Sunday"
Well I didn't go to work
I told the boss I was sick
He said "You can't use the car
'cause you didn't work a lick"
Sometimes I wonder what I'm a'gonna do
There ain't no cure for the summertime blues
Gonna take two weeks
Gonna have a fine vacation
Gonna take my problem
To the United Nations
Well I went to my congressman
He said, quote: "I'd like to help you son
But you're too young to vote"
Sometimes I wonder what I'm a'gonna do
There ain't no cure for the summertime blues
