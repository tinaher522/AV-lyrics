<song artist="Who" title="My_Generation-Land_Of_Hope_And_Glory">
People try to put us d-d-down (Talkin' 'bout my generation)
Just because we get around (Talkin' 'bout my generation)
Things they do look awful c-c-cold (Talkin' 'bout my generation)
I hope I die before I get old (Talkin' 'bout my generation)
This is my generation
This is my generation, baby
Land of hope and glory
Land of hope and glory
Land of hope and glory
Land of hope and glory
Land of hope and glory
Land of hope and glory
