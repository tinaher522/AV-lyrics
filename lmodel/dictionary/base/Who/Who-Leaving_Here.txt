<song artist="Who" title="Leaving_Here">
Hey fellas, have you heard the news?
Yeah, the women of this town are being misused
I've seen it all in my dreams last night
Girls leaving this town 'cause we don't treat 'em right
Come on, take a train (take a train)
Fly by plane (fly by plane)
They're leaving here (leaving here)
Leaving here (leaving here)
The love of a woman is a wonderful thing
Yeah, the way you treat 'em is a crying shame
I'll tell you baby, yeah, it won't be long
Yeah, before these women, they all have gone
I'm getting tired (getting tired)
Sick and tired (sick and tired)
They're leaving here (leaving here)
Leaving here (leaving here)
Oh yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah
Leaving here
Come on baby baby
Leaving here
Yeah leaving here
They're leaving here
They're leaving here
They're gonna leaving here
Yeah babe
Babe gonna leave here
