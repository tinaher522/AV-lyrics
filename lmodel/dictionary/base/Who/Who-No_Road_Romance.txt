<song artist="Who" title="No_Road_Romance">
When you look through the lights to the stage
You see the man of your dreams
You think his life's full of parties and love
But it's not what it seems
If you could see in his room right now
You'd see how much love is showed
There's never really any romance on the road
His forehead seems cut in two
By the crease in his brow
He chews his nails and he fidgets
Just trying to settle on down
The TV channels keep flicking
His adrenaline slowed
There's never really any romance on the road
Oh no
There's never romance on the road
Only frustration and overload
He could fall in love, but he'd never know
For she's only riding
And he's only hiding
He's sure to ask
She won't say no
But there's never really any romance on the road
He was up in the bar straight-backed, did you see him before?
Did he sign you his name, come with me, listen in at his door?
Hear himself so drunk calling home, can't remember the code
You know, there's never really any romance on the road, oh no no no
He's held some beautiful girls in his arms
But now he clutches his bike
Whatever good did they do in him now, he might as well be a mic
For his memories aren't worth a thing
Till he's old and he's gone
And his past never quite catches up
The show's moving on
Did he say he kept a picture of a blonde-haired girl
Who'd been kind
When he was last home his own daughter
Brought it into his mind
Maybe closing bars and jets
Paid some debts that he owed
But there's never really any romance on the road
There's never romance on the road
Only frustration and overload
He's never learned a thing from the dust that blowed
On stage for an hour
On a laser beam tower
But you know he slept while a neon glowed
There's never really any romance on the road
There's never romance on the road
Only frustration and overload
He could fall in love
But he'd never know
For she's only riding
And he's only hiding
He's sure to ask
But she won't say no
There's never really any romance on the road
