<song artist="Who" title="The_Quiet_One">
Everybody calls me the quiet one
You can see, but you can't hear me
Everybody calls me the quiet one
You can try, but you can't get near me
I ain't never ever had 
The gift of the gab
But I can talk with my eyes
When words fail me
You won't nail me
My eyes can tell you lies
Still waters run deep
So be careful I don't drown you
You got nothing to hear, I got nothing to say
Sticks and stones may break your bones
But names can never down you
It only takes two words to blow you away
Everybody calls me the quiet one
But you just don't understand
You can't listen, you won't hear me
With your head stuck in the sand
I ain't never had time 
For words that don't rhyme
My head is in a cloud
I ain't quiet
Everybody else is too loud
Still waters run deep
So be careful I don't drown you
You nothing to hear, I got nothing to say
Sticks and stones may break your bones
But names can never down you
It only takes two words to blow you away
