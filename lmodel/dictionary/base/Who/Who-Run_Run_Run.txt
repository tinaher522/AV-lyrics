<song artist="Who" title="Run_Run_Run">
Run, run, run
Run, run, run
Run, run, run
Run, run, run
Well baby, better take my advice
A black cat crossed your path twice
The moon came out next to the sun
Then you opened your umbrella in a room
You better run, run, run
Run, run, run
Run, run, run
Run, run, run
Well you ain't the luckiest girl I know
And you won't get luckier the way you're going
Your horseshoe's rusty and your mirror's cracked
You walk under ladders then you walk right back
You better run, run, run
Run, run, run
Run, run, run
Run, run, run
When you dropped that little pin
Never thought what a mess it'd get you in
Little pin, little pin, bring me luck
Because I stopped to pick you up
You better run, run, run
Run, run, run
Run, run, run
Run, run, run
Well now, little girl, I'm helping you
I hope you believe what I say is true
Whenever you run, I'll be running too
Whenever you run, I'll be following you
You better run, run, run
Run, run, run
Run, run, run
Run, run, run
Run, run, run
