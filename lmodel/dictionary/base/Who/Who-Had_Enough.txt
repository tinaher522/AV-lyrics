<song artist="Who" title="Had_Enough">
I've had enough of bein' nice
I've had enough of right and wrong
I've had enough of tryin' to love my brother
I've had enough of bein' good
And doin' everything like I'm told I should
If you need a lover, you'd better find another
Life is for the living
Ooh, yeah
Takers never giving
Suspicion takes the place of trust
My love is turning into lust
If you get on the wrong side of me you better run for cover
I've had enough of bein' trodden on
My passive days are gonna be long gone
If you slap one cheek, well, I ain't gonna turn the other
Life is for the living
Takers never giving
Fooling no one
but ourselves
Good is dying
Here comes the end
Here comes the end of the world
I'm gettin' sick of this universe
Ain't gonna get better; it's gonna get worse
And the world's gonna sink with the weight of the human race
Hate and fear in every face
I'm gettin' ready and I've packed my case
If you find somewhere better, can you save my place?
Fooling no one but ourselves
Love is dying
Here comes the end
Here comes the end
of the world
