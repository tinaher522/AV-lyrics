<song artist="Who" title="Man_Is_A_Man">
You talk about crazy affairs
You talk about crazy affairs
You talk about your life as though it mattered
You talk about your life as though it mattered
You get attention 'cause you block the stairs
You get attention 'cause you block the stairs
Bragging about some bottles you have shattered
Bragging about some bottles you have shattered
Well, I met a man who really lives
Well, I met a man who really lives
He really does it all
He really does it all
But what really matters is the heart he gives
But what really matters is the heart he gives
He makes your talk seem small
He makes your talk seem small
When a man is a man
When a man is a man
He doesn't act to a plan
He doesn't act to a plan
He don't have to perform like John Wayne in some B feature flick
He don't have to perform like john wayne in some B feature flick
A man is a man
A man is a man
When he can offer his hand
When he can offer his hand
Not afraid of appearing insane if he can't break a brick
Not afraid of appearing insane if he can't break a brick
I know a man who's a man
I know a man who's a man
Can't you sometimes crack a smile?
Can't you sometimes crack a smile?
Do you think if you did, we would run and tell?
Do you think if you did, we would run and tell?
I know one day your big villain style
I know one day your big villain style
Will collapse as they turn the key in the door of your cell
Will collapse as they turn the key in the door of your cell
I know a man who was once like you
I know a man who was once like you
But he opened his heart
But he opened his heart
No one is really bad right through
No one is really bad right through
He's just another part
He's just another part
When a man is a man
When a man is a man
And he drinks till he's canned
And he drinks till he's canned
He can drop to the floor, he can weep; we won't ask the price
He can drop to the floor, he can weep; we won't ask the price
A man is a man
A man is a man
He can fall, he can stand
He can fall, he can stand
We won't love him more if he keeps his soul on the ice
We won't love him more if he keeps his soul on the ice
I know a man who's a man
I know a man who's a man
Every one of us is looking for fame
Every one of us is looking for fame
He's a looker
He's a looker
He's a dresser
He's a dresser
He's a genius under pressure
He's a genius under pressure
I know a man who could tighten your rein
I know a man who could tighten your rein
He's a father
He's a father
He's a brother
He's a brother
He's a rock
He's a rock
He's a lover
He's a lover
He's a man, he's a man
He's a man, he's a man
He doesn't act to a plan
He doesn't act to a plan
He don't have to get hitched to a train in some muscle beach trick
He don't have to get hitched to a train in some muscle beach trick
A man is a man
A man is a man
When he can offer his hand
When he can offer his hand
Not afraid of appearing insane if he can't break a brick
Not afraid of appearing insane if he can't break a brick
Be a man who's a man
Be a man who's a man
