<song artist="Who" title="Cousin_Kevin_(Soundtrack_Version)">
We're on our own, cousin, all alone cousin
Let's think of a game to play
Now the grownups have all gone away
You won't be much fun
Being blind, deaf and dumb
But I've no one to play with today
Do you know how to play hide and seek?
To find me, it would take you a week
But tied to that chair you won't go anywhere
There's a lot I can do to a freak
How would you feel if I turned on the bath
Ducked your head under and started to laugh
Maybe a cigarette burn on your arm
Would change your expression to one of alarm
I'm the school bully!
The classroom cheat
The nastiest playfriend
You ever could meet
I'll put glass in your dinner
And spikes in your seat
I'll drag you around by a lock of your hair
And give you a push at the top of the stairs
What would you do if I shut you outside
To stand in the rain and catch cold, so you'd die?
I'm the school bully!
The classroom cheat
The nastiest playfriend
You ever could meet
I'll stick pins in your fingers
And tread on your feet
We're on our own, cousin, all alone, cousin
We've thought of some nice games to play
While the grownups has all gone away
You weren't too much fun
'Cos you're blind, deaf and dumb
But I've no one to play with today
