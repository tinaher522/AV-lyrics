<song artist="Who" title="Eyesight_To_The_Blind_(The_Hawker)_(Soundtrack_Version)">
You talk about your woman
I wish you could see mine
You talk about your woman
I wish you could see mine
Every time she starts to lovin'
She brings eyesight to the blind
Oh yeah
You know her daddy gave her magic
I can tell by the way she walks
You know, her daddy gave her magic
I can tell by the way she walks
Every time she starts to shake
The dumb begin to talk
Talk, talk, talk!
She's got the power to heal you, never fear
She has got the power to heal you, never fear
Just one word from her lips
And the deaf can hear
