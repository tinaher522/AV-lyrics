<song artist="Who" title="It's_In_You">
I read your letter and the things you say
You say power chords are all that we should play
Well this is what you're gonna eat today, Virginia
'Cause if power chords are what you say you need
Look inside your body, baby, you will see
That man in air and flying seed is in you
You got it in you
But if you depend on me to make you rock and roll
Well you better look out tich, because we're gettin' old
Look inside and check out your neglected soul, Virginia
'Cause I can seem to dance out all alone on the scene
Or VIP and fight down at the music machine
But as for you, the place to look for rock and roll is in you
You got it in you
You got it in you
You know you got it in you
It's in you
You got it in you
Your letter came and today is the eighth
This is the day that Moonie earned his wraith
And it makes me want to tell you stuff on letters
Dear Virginia
And if you really care then better stay awake
Take me out again, baby, and say that I'm a fake
And you can then forsake the part of me that's in you
Oh, it's in you
Oh now, you got me in you
Ooh, yeah, it's all in you
Can you feel it in you?
You got it in you
You've got it in your heart
You got it in you
I'm just a tiny part of what is in you
Please remember, darling, sweet Virginia
That everything you need's already in you
Well I forgive completely all your lack of tact
My patience's holding out and it's a hard-earned fact
That I could easily buy your time
Dearest Virginia
But you will always give me just one more chance
You'll hang around and ask me for a chance to dance
But I can't make you jump, baby, if it ain't in you
You've got it in you
You got it in your heart
You've got it in you
You know, I'm just a tiny part of what is in you
Please remember darling, sweet Virginia
Everything you need's already in you
Oh yeah, you've got it in you
You got me in you
Hey, tich...
Toe-rag...
Mmm tosser...
You got me in you
You got it in you
Oh, you know it's in you
