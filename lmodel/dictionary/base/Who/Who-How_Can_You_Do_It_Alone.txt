<song artist="Who" title="How_Can_You_Do_It_Alone">
I saw a man about fifty or so
He looked lonely but his eyes were bright
He was walking up Holland Park Road
And I stopped him to ask for a light
He practically froze when I spoke
But he eased when he saw my cigarette
Then I saw as he lit up my smoke
Beneath his coat he was naked and wet
With eyes full of shame
For he knew that I knew
He slumped to the wall with a moan
I said "I know there's no name
For what you go through
But how, how can you do it alone"
I crossed the street to the local news store
And flicked through some cheap magazines
Beside me some school kid I saw
Stuffed some girlie mags down into his jeans
The shop girl was watching amazed
She asked me to call for the police
She screamed at his blushing young face
And he escaped into the streets
With eyes full of shame
For he knew that I knew
He slumped to the wall with a moan
I said "I know there's no name
For what you go through
But how, how can you do it alone"
Ooh, how can you do it alone
I need your help, so I can do it by myself
Do it alone, don't have to breathe down a phone
I ain't got a clue, 'bout the things that you do
But how can you do it alone
How can you do it
How can you do it
How can you do it
How can you do it
How can you do it
How can you do it
How can you do it
How can you do it
Back at the flat my girl sat in the shower
And wasn't too keen on me sharing
She came out well after an hour
And by that time I was past caring
Some women it seems have the knack
Of attaining the stars in their dreams
They simply relax and lay back
While people like us scratch our jeans
With eyes full of shame
And I know it must show
I slump and I fall and I groan
Will somebody explain
What I need to know
How, how can you do it alone
How can you do it (Yeah, how can you do it)
How can you do it (Do it alone)
How can you do it (How can you do it, how can you do it)
How can you do it (How can you do it, how can you do it alone)
How can you do it (How can you do it alone)
How can you do it (How can you do it)
How can you do it (How can you do it alone)
How can you do it
How can you do it without any help
How can you do it all by yourself
How can you do it without any help
How can you do it all by yourself
How can you do it without any help
How can you do it all by yourself
How can you do it without any help
How can you do it all by yourself
