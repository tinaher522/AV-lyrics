<song artist="Who" title="(I'm_A)_Road_Runner">
I'm a roadrunner, honey
I'm a roadrunner, honey
And you can't keep up with me
Ooh, I'm a roadrunner, honey
And you can't keep up with me
I'm a, you and me
I'm a roadrunner, honey
And you can't keep up with me
Oh yeah, I'm a roadrunner, honey
And you can't keep up with me
I'm gonna show you
Baby, baby, you and me
