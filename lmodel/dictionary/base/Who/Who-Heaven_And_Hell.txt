<song artist="Who" title="Heaven_And_Hell">
On top of the sky
Is a place where you go
If you've done nothing wrong
If you've done nothing wrong
And down in the ground
Is a place where you go
If you've been a bad boy
If you've been a bad boy
Why can't we have eternal life
And never die?
Never die? 
In the place up above
You grow feather wings
And you fly round and round
With a harp singing hymns
And down in the ground
You grow horns and a tail
And you carry a fork
And molder away
Why can't we have eternal life
And never die?
Never die?
On top of the sky
Is a place where you go
If you've done nothing wrong
If you've done nothing wrong
And down in the ground
Is a place where you go
If you've been a bad boy
If you've been a bad boy
Why can't we have eternal life
And never die?
Never die?
Never die?
