<song artist="Who" title="I've_Been_Away">
I've been away so long
Wonder where I went wrong
Spent my last years in a cell
Never ever go away again
I've been so sad and lonely
Never ever ever gonna go away again
It's a waste of time doing time
When you didn't commit a crime
It wasn't me it was my brother Bill
And I'd have to tell never gonna speak to Bill again
He's made me sad and lonely
Never ever gonna speak to brother Bill again
It was no use, they put my brother on the jury
He bribed the others 'cause he owns the local brewery
They let me out today
Brother Bill's gonna pay
No one's ever gonna speak to Bill again
Never ever gonna speak to Bill again
He'll be too cold and bony
Never ever gonna go away again
Never ever gonna go away again
Never ever gonna go away again
