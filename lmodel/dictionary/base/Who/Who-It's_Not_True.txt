<song artist="Who" title="It's_Not_True">
It's not true
You say I've been in prison
You say I've got a wife
You say I've had help doing
Everything throughout my life
It's not true, it's not true
I'm telling you
'Cause I'm up here and you're nowhere
It's not true, so there
I haven't got eleven kids
I weren't born in Baghdad
I'm not half-Chinese, either
And I didn't kill my dad
It's not true, it's not true
I'm telling you
'Cause I'm up here and you're nowhere
It's not true, so there
If you hear more rumors
You can just forget them, too
Fools start the rumors
None of them are true
It's not true, it's not true
I'm telling you
'Cause I'm up here and you're nowhere
It's not true, so there
You say I've been in prison
You say I've got a wife
You say I've had help doing
Everything throughout my life
I haven't got eleven kids
I weren't born in Baghdad
I'm not half-Chinese, either
And I didn't kill my dad
It's not true, it's not true
I'm telling you
'Cause I'm up here and you're nowhere
It's not true, so there
It's not true, it's not true
I'm telling you
'Cause I'm up here and you're nowhere
It's not true, so there
