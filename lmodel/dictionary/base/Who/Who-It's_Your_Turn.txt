<song artist="Who" title="It's_Your_Turn">
Up here on the ledge
I'm getting pushed to the edge
People line up behind me to step into my shoes
Up here in the precipice
I'm getting close to my nemesis
People fighting each other to jump into my blues
There's a young kid inside me somewhere
He stays up all night, a vampire that never dies
With the blood and the moon in his eyes
I hear his voice when I'm comin' down
Sleep is for fools who never see the sunrise
Who never get to live twice
I was a face in a magazine
When you were still playin' with your plasticine
Now you're doggin' my tail, ridin' the slipstream
You can take the fans and the enemies
The little girls who squeeze and tease
Then pass on their social disease, go get your penicillin
I know you, young and dumb
I know where you're comin' from
Don't know where you're goin' to
But I been there same as you
You're running out of ideas
And new hats to try on
I know you, middle age
Same song, different page
I know what you're goin' through
Made the same mistakes as you
All you want is some hope
And a shoulder to cry on
There's a stranger inside me somewhere
That shadow behind me, don't even look like me
An echoed apology
He's a wolf in a sheep disguise
I wake up in places I don't even recognize
Pretender in paradise
It's your turn, step up and take it
If you've got the guts to hang on, you can make it
C'mon!
C'mon!
Come on!
Ooh, take it!
