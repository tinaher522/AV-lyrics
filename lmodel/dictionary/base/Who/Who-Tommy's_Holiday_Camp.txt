Uncle Ernie:
Good morning campers!
I'm your Uncle Ernie
And I welcome you to Tommy's Holiday Camp!
The camp with the difference
Nevermind the weather,
When you come to Tommy's the holiday's forever!
The camp with the difference, nevermind the weather
When you come to Tommy's the holiday's forever!
WELCOME!!!
