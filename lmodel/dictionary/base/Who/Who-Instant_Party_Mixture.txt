(Shoop-shoop shoop-sha-wadda-wadda x12)
I guess you know what makes a party go
If you don't, we better let you know
The reason why I've seen is really hot
(Yes, it's all because they're smoking a new cigarette)
(Shoop-shoop shoop-sha-wadda-wadda x4)
From East to West the people gather around
DJ's playing really groovy sounds
He blasts the music, I would like more thrills
(That's 'cause you really have those Earache problems)
(Shoop-shoop shoop-sha-wadda-wadda x4)
Don't hesitate to bring your mum and dad
Hate to think they're in home in bed
What makes grandpa do the Monster Mash?
(It's 'cause me pockets are full of Sausage 'n' Mash!)
(Shoop-shoop shoop-sha-wadda-wadda x4)
(Shoop-shoop-shoop shoop-shoop-sha-wadda-wadda x12)
(Hit me!)
(Yeah, man!)
(That last one was wild!)
(We got it goin' again!)
(Woah!)
(Yee-Haw! That was the sound, man!)
