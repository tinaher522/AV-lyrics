<song artist="Who" title="Jaguar">
Grace... Space... Race...
Everything they've seen you have seen
Everywhere they've been you have been
Everything they've done you have been and done already
Every lovely spot, near or far
You can reach them too in your car
Or you might be there now if you own a Jag already
The radio blasting, the girls are glancing
The dash is dancing with gleaming dials
Grace... Space... Race...
Grace... Space... Race...
Jaguar
Jaguar
Jaguar
Ja-gu-ar!
