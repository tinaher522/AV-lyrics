<song artist="Who" title="Welcome_(Soundtrack_Version)">
Tommy:
Come to my house
Be one of the comfortable people
Come to this house
We're drinking all night
Never sleeping
Milkman come in
And you, baker
Little old lady welcome
And you, shoemaker
Come to this house
Into this house
Frank and Nora:
Come to this house
Be one of us
Make this your house
Be one of us
Tommy:
You can help
To collect some more in
Young and old people
Let's get them all in
Come to this house
Into this house
Ask along that man
With a big red carnation
Bring every single person
From Victoria Station
Go into that hospital
And bring the nurses and patients
Everyone go home and fetch their relations
Tommy, Frank and Nora:
Come to this house
Be one of the comfortable people
Lovely bright home
We're drinking all night never sleeping
Frank:
Hold on, Tommy, there's more at the door
They'll come through the floor
There's more at the door
There's more at the door
There's more at the door
There's more at the door
There's more at the door
There's more at the door
There's more at the door
There's more!
Tommy:
We need more room
Build an extension
A colorful palace
Spare no expense now
Come to this house
Be one of us
Make this your house
Be one of us
Come to me now
Come to me now
Welcome, welcome
