Nora:
Got a feeling fifty one
Is going to be a good year
Especially if you and me
See it out together
Frank:
So you think that fifty one
Is going to be a good year
We'll marry now and
See it out together
Nora:
I have no reason to be over optimistic
But somehow when you smile
I can brave bad weather
What about the boy?
What about the boy?
What about the boy
He saw it all
Frank:
He didn't hear it
He didn't see it
He won't say nothin' to no one ever in your life
You never heard it
How absurd it
All seems without any proof
Nora:
You didn't hear it
You didn't see it
You won't say nothin' to no one ever in your life
You never heard it
How absurd it
All seems without any proof
Nora and Frank:
You didn't hear it
You didn't see it
You never heard it not a word of it
You won't say nothin' to no one
Never tell a soul
What you know is the Truth
