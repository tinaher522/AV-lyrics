<song artist="Who" title="Bargain">
I'd gladly lose me to find you
I'd gladly give up all I have
To find you
I'd suffer anything and be glad
I'll pay any price just to get you
I'd work all my life and I will
To win you
I'd stand naked, stoned and stabbed
I call that a bargain
The best I ever had
The best I ever had
I'd gladly lose me to find you
Gladly give up all I got
To catch you
I'm gonna run and never stop
I'll pay any price just to win you
Surrender my good life for bad
To find you
I'm gonna drown an unsung man
I call that a bargain
The best I ever had
The best I ever had
I sit looking 'round
I look at my face in the mirror
I know I'm worth nothing
Without you
In life, one and one don't make two
One and one make one
And I'm lookin' for
That free ride to me
I'm looking for you
I'd gladly lose me to find you
Gladly give up all I got
To catch you
I'm gonna run and never stop
I'll pay any price just to win you
Surrender my good life for bad
To find you
I'm gonna drown an unsung man
I call that a bargain
The best I ever had
The best I ever had
