<song artist="Who" title="Saturday_Night's_Alright_(For_Fighting)">
It's getting late, have you seen my mates?
Go on, tell me when the boys get here
It's seven o'clock and I want to rock
I want to get a belly full of beer
My old man's drunker than a barrel full of monkeys
And my old lady, she don't care
My sister looks cute in her braces and boots
And a handful of grease in her hair
Hey, don't give us none of your aggravation
We've had it with your discipline
Saturday night's alright for fighting, get a little action in
I get about as oiled as a diesel train, gonna set this dance alight
'Cause Saturday night's the night I like
Saturday night's alright, alright, alright
Well, they're packed pretty tight in here tonight
And I'm looking for a dolly who'll see me right
I may use a little muscle to get what I need
And sink a little drink and shout, "She's with me!"
A couple of the sounds that I really like
Are the sound of a switchblade and a motorbike
I'm a juvenile product of the working class
Whose best friend floats in the bottom of a glass
But don't, don't give us none of your aggravation, we've had it with your discipline
Saturday night's alright for fighting, to get a little action in
I get about as oiled as a diesel train, gonna set this dance alight
Saturday night's the night I like
Saturday night's alright, alright, alright
Saturday night's alright, alright, alright
Saturday, Saturday, Saturday!
Saturday, Saturday, Saturday!
Saturday, Saturday, Saturday!
Saturday, Saturday!
Take me to the pilot, lead me through the chamber
Take me to the pilot, I am but a stranger
Take me to the pilot, lead me through the chamber
Take me to the pilot, I am but a stranger
Na na na, na na na
Na na na, na na na na na
Na na na, na na na
Na na na, na na na na na
Ooh yeah!
Saturday, Saturday!
Saturday, Saturday!
Saturday, Saturday!
Saturday, Saturday!
I can't wait for Saturday!
Saturday, Saturday, Saturday!
Saturday, Saturday, Saturday!
Saturday, Saturday, Saturday!
Saturday, Saturday, Saturday!
I can't wait for Saturday night night night night night
