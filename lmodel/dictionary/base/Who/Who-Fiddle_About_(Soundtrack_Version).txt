<song artist="Who" title="Fiddle_About_(Soundtrack_Version)">
I'm your wicked Uncle Ernie
I'm glad you won't see or hear me
As I fiddle about
Fiddle about
Fiddle about
Your mother left me here to mind you
Now I'm doing exactly what I bleedin' well want to
Fiddling about
Fiddling about
Fiddle about
Down with your bedclothes
Up with your nightshirt!
Fiddle about
Fiddle about
Fiddle about!
You won't shout as I fiddle about
Fiddle about
Fiddle about
Fiddle about
