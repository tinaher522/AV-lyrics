<song artist="Who" title="Please_Please_Please">
Please, please, please, please me
Baby please, baby please, please me
Baby please, baby please don't go
Don't go, I said baby, don't baby 
I love you so
Baby, you know you broke my heart when you went away
I said, I said, I said I'll see you some other day
I said, baby, baby, please, don't go
Don't go, no baby, no baby
I love you so
Take this pain from my heart
Baby, let me take you by the hand
Baby, baby let me, let me be your lover man
Baby please, baby please don't go
Don't go, I said baby, don't baby 
I love you so
Please, please, please, please me
Baby please, baby please, please me
Baby please, baby please don't go
Don't go, I said baby, don't baby 
I love you so
Please please me
