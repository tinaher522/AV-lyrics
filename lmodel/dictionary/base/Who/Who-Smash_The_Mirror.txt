<song artist="Who" title="Smash_The_Mirror">
Mother:
You don't answer my call
With even a nod or a twitch
But you gaze at your own reflection!
You don't seem to see me
But I think you can see yourself.
How can the mirror affect you?
Can you hear me
Or do I surmise
That you fear me?
Can you feel my temper RISE?
Do you hear or fear or
Do I smash the mirror?
Do you hear or fear or
Do I smash the mirror? SMASH!
