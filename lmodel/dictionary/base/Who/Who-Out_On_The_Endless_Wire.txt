<song artist="Who" title="Out_On_The_Endless_Wire">
We found this pile of paper
Written by the Ether Man
He hatched a mad old caper
He had a mad old plan
He'd turn us in to music
He'd show us to our portals
He gathered wire and angels
To entertain immortals
Out on the endless, endless
Out on the endless wire
Out on the endless, endless
Out on the endless, endless, endless, endless wire
Out on the endless, endless
Out on the endless wire
Out on the endless, endless
Out on the endless wire
