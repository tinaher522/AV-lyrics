<song artist="Who" title="Naked_Eye">
Take a little dope
And walk out in the air
The stars are all connected to the brain
Find me a woman and lay down on the ground
Her pleasure comes falling down like rain
Get myself a car, I feel power as I fly
Oh now I'm really in control
It all looks fine to the naked eye
But it don't really happen that way at all
Don't happen that way at all
You sign your own name and I sign mine
They're both the same but we still get separate rooms
You can cover up your guts but when you cover up your nuts
You're admitting that there must be something wrong
Press any button and milk and honey flows
The world begins behind your neighbor's wall
It all looks fine to the naked eye
But it don't really happen that way at all
Nah nah no, don't happen that way at all
You hold the gun and I hold the wound
And we stand looking in each other's eyes
It all looks fine to the naked eye
But it don't really happen that way at all
