<song artist="Who" title="Tea_&_Theatre">
Will you have some tea
After theatre with me?
We did it all - didn't we?
Jumped every wall - instinctively
Unraveled codes - ingeniously
Wired all the roads - so seamlessly
We made it work
But one of us failed
That makes it so sad
A great dream derailed
One of us gone
One of us mad
One of us, me
All of us sad
All of us sad - lean on my shoulder now
The story is done - 's getting colder now
A thousand songs  - still smoulder now
We play them as one - we're older now
All of us sad
All of us free
Before we walk from this stage
Two of us
Will you have some tea?
Will you have some tea
At the theatre with me?
