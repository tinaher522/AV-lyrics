<song artist="Who" title="Don't_Let_Go_The_Coat">
I can't be held responsible for blown behaviour
I lost all contact with my only saviour
No-one locked me out because I failed to phone up
I can't bear to live forever like a loner
Don't let go the coat, don't let go the coat
Don't let go the coat, don't let go the coat
It's easy to be sad when you lack a partner
But how would I react to a broken heart now
It ain't really true rock and roll unless I'm
Hanging onto you and when I hold it next time
I won't let go the coat, don't let go the coat
Don't let go the coat, don't let go the coat
I try to explain but you never understand it
I need your body but I can't just demand it
I won't let go like a stray at heel
(Never let it out of your sight)
Every lonely wife knows the way I feel
(Don't let go tonight)
Don't let go the coat, never let go the coat
Don't let go the coat, don't let go the coat,
Don't let go the coat
Your friends all pass for life is just a market
But you have to finish everything you started
So I live my life tearing down the runway
Sure to get the hang of hanging in there someday
Don't let go the coat, don't let go the coat,
Never let go the coat, don't let go the coat,
Don't let go the coat
Won't get no more chances - ooh forget the war dances
Don't let go, don't let go, don't let go the coat,
Never let go the coat, don't let go the coat
Don't let go
Go blind and hang on - don't try the slang son
Never let go the coat, no no, don't let go the coat, 
Don't let go, don't let go the coat...
