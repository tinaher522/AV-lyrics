Extra Extra Pinball bonanza
Deaf, dumb and blind kid makes the big game
Saturday final he faces the champ
Extra Extra
Pinball big time
Million in hand!
You can rule the world from a yacht in the bay
Champagne flowing down
A popular man
Pinball - Let's play
Tommy keeps a-winnin'
He's a millionaire
Mamma's got a brand new Cadillac
Hurry to the show
We're nearly on the air
Extra! Extra!
