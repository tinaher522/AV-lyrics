<song artist="Who" title="Christmas_(Soundtrack_Version)">
Nora:
Did you ever see the faces of the children
They get so excited
Waking up on Christmas morning
Hours before the winter sun's ignited
They believe in dreams and all they mean
Including heaven's generosity
Peeping 'round the door to see what parcels are for free
In curiosity
And Tommy doesn't know what day it is
He doesn't know who Jesus was or what praying is
Nora, Frank and Relatives:
How can he be saved?
From the eternal grave?
Frank:
Tommy can you hear me?
Tommy can you hear me?
Nora:
Tommy can you hear me?
Tommy can you hear me?
Nora and Frank:
Tommy can you hear me?
Can you, can you hear me? (Tommy can you hear me?)
Nora, Frank and Relatives:
How can he be saved?
Tommy:
See me, feel me, touch me, heal me
See me, feel me, touch me, heal me
Nora and Frank:
Tommy can you hear me?
Tommy can you hear me?
Relatives:
How can he be saved?
Frank:
Surrounded by his friends
He sits so silently and unaware of anything
Glazy-eyed he picks his nose
He smiles he cries
He pokes his tongue at everything
Nora:
I believe in love
But how can men who've never seen light
Be enlightened?
Only if he's cured 
Will his spirit's future level ever heighten
Frank:
And Tommy doesn't know what day it is
Nora:
He doesn't know who Jesus was
Or what praying is
Nora, Frank and Relatives:
How can he be saved?
From the eternal grave?
