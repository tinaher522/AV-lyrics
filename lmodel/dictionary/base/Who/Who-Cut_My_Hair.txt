<song artist="Who" title="Cut_My_Hair">
Why should I care
If I have to cut my hair?
I got to move with the fashion or be outcast
I know I should fight
But my old man, he's really alright
And I'm still living at home, even though it won't last
Zoot suit, white jacket with side vents five inches long
I'm out on the street again, and I'm leaping along
Dressed right
For a beach fight
But I just can't explain
Why that uncertain feeling is still here in my brain
The kids at school have parents that seem so cool
And though I don't want to hurt em', mine want me their way
I clean my room and my shoes
But my mama found a box of blues
And there doesn't seem much hope they'll let me stay
Zoot suit, white jacket with side vents five inches long
I'm out on the street again, and I'm leaping along
Dressed right
For a beach fight
But I just can't explain
Why that uncertain feeling is still here in my brain
Why do I have to be different to them
Just to earn the respect of a dance hall friend?
We have the same old row again and again
Why do I have to move with a crowd
Of kids that hardly notice I'm around?
I work myself to death, just to fit in
I'm comin' down
Got home on the very first train from town
My dad just left for work, he wasn't talking
It's all a game
And inside, I'm just the same
My fried egg makes me sick first thing in the morning
