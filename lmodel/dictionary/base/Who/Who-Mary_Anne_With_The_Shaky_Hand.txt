<song artist="Who" title="Mary_Anne_With_The_Shaky_Hand">
I danced with Linda
I danced with Jean
I danced with Cindy
Then I suddenly see
Mary-Anne with the shaky hands
What they've done to a man
Those shaky hands
Mary is so pretty
The prettiest in the land
Guys come from every city
Just to shake her shaky hands
Linda can cook
Jean reads books
Cindy can sew
But I'd rather know
Mary-Anne with the shaky hands
What they've done to a man
Those shaky hands
Mary-Anne with the shaky hands
What they've done to a man
Those shaky hands
Mary-Anne with the shaky hands
What they've done to a man
Those shaky hands
