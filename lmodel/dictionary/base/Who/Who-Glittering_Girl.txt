<song artist="Who" title="Glittering_Girl">
She wasn't a fool, that glittering girl
She followed the rules, that shimmering pearl
Said the rules Mama preaches
Go down when they break
The things Mama teaches
You just gotta shake
But she wasn't a fool, that slender love figure
She followed her rule and made money bigger
She wasn't a fool, that shining young woman
She followed her rule, she's crying for no man
Said the rules Mama teaches
Go down when they're broken
She explodes into peaches
And cries when I've spoken
She wasn't a fool, that goddess of hell
There are no mother's rules, she makes them herself
If I was down upon my knees 
To beg her, surrender up to me
Something inside her
Told her she shouldn't
Tried and alight her
But the girl wouldn't
She wasn't a fool but love flowed from her face
She's not scared of me, she's afraid of disgrace
She wasn't a fool that female for our world
She followed her rules, that glittering girl
That glittering girl
That glittering girl
That glittering girl
