<song artist="Who" title="Did_You_Steal_My_Money">
I wake up on broken glass
But you left your number
All the members of the cast
They reckon I was lumbered
Did you steal it?
Did you screw me?
Did you peel it?
Did you do me?
Did you steal my money?
Did you steal my money?
Are you out there Mr. No-One?
Is my investment growing?
Sorry that I got so drunk
But I wrote you a poem
Did you search me?
Did you turn me over?
While I cold-turkeyed
On the sofa
Did you steal my money?
Did you steal my money?
How can we forgive a grievance?
Now that we all live with demons?
Did you know that poor old veteran?
That you kicked right outta his bed?
Says that he cannot forget you
But he does not wish you dead
Just leave his gold watch in reception
And he'll keep the sixteen stitches in his head
Did you steal his money?
Did you steal his money?
Did you pinch my trainer football?
Say if you half-inched it
Thought I heard a female foot fall
While I washed my kitchen
Did you use me?
Why did I trust you?
Why'd you abuse me?
I ain't gonna bust you
Did you steal my money?
Did you steal my money?
Did you steal my lolly?
It fell right off my lorry
Did you pinch my brasso?
Nick my gelt you asshole?
Did you steal my money?
Did ya?
