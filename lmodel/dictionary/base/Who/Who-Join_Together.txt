<song artist="Who" title="Join_Together">
When you here the sound a coming
Hear the drummers drumming
I want you to join together with the band
We don't move in any particular direction
And we don't make no collections
I want you to join together with the band
Do you really think I care
What you mean or what you wear
I want you to join together with the band
There's a million ways to last
And every one's a path
Come on and join together with the band
Join together, I want you to join together
Come on and join together with the band
We need you to join together, join together
Join together with the band
You don't have to play
You can follow or lead the way
I want you to join together with the band
We don't know where we're going
But the season's right for knowing
I want you to join together with the band
It's the singer not the song
That makes the music move along
I want you to join together with the band
This is the biggest band you'll find
It's as deep as it is wide
Come on and join together with the band
Join together, join together
Join together with the band
We need you to join together, join together
Join together with the band
