<song artist="Who" title="Joker_James">
Joker James, you did it again, caused somebody pain
You lived up to your name, Jimmy, Joker James
Sally was a stamp collector, pretty little girl
One day she dated James, bringing love into her world
A tense romantic moment as they sat down on the couch
The whoopee cushion roared and I'm afraid it's over now
(He's a joker...) 
Joker James, you did it again, caused somebody pain
You lived up to your name, didn't you, Joker James
Lucy was a cool one, always got her high
Then she dated James and true love took her higher
The jester had suggested a new way to get stoned
Put itching powder down her neck and now she's all alone
Joker James, you did it again, caused somebody pain
You lived up to your name, didn't you, Joker James
Sense of humor cannot woo her
You just threw another wheeze her way
Wizard pranks won't get you thanks
You just threw another love away
Alice was a different kettle, always wore a smile
Her skin felt like heaven and laughter all the while
Her sense of humor throws him and deep in love he falls
But when he tries to sign the paper the rubber pencil falls
(He's a joker...)
Joker James, you're not to blame, the joke's on you, now you're blue
It's such a shame, but that's the game, Joker James
Joker James, you did it again, caused somebody pain
You lived up to your name, Jimmy, Joker James
