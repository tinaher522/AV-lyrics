<song artist="Who" title="It's_Hard">
Any tough can fight, few can play
Any fool can fall, few can lay
Any stud can reproduce, few can please
Anyone can pay, few can lease
It's hard
(It's a hard hand to hold)
It's very very very very hard
(It's a hard hard hand)
It's very very very very hard
(It's a hard land to control)
It's very hard
(It's a hard land)
Any man can claim, few can find
Any girl can blink, few can lie
Anyone can promise, few can raise
Anyone can try, but a few can stay
It's hard
(It's a hard hand to hold)
It's very very very very hard
(It's a hard hard hand)
It's very very very very hard
(It's a hard land to control)
So very hard
(It's a hard land)
It's hard
So hard...
Any brain can hide, few can stand
Any kid can fly, a few can land
Any gang can scatter, few can form
Any kid can chatter, few can inform
It's hard
(It's a hard hand to hold)
It's very very very very hard
(It's a hard hard hand)
It's very very very very hard
(It's a hard land to control)
So very hard
(It's a hard land)
Any soul can sleep, few can die
Any wimp can weep, but a few can cry
Everyone complains, but a few can state
Anyone can stop, but a few can wait
It's hard
(It's a hard hand to hold)
Very very very very hard
(It's a hard hard hand)
It's very very very very hard
(It's a hard land to control)
So hard
(It's a hard land)
Anyone can do anything if they hold the right card
So I'm thinking about my life now
I'm thinking very hard
Deal me another hand Lord, this one's very hard
(It's a hard hard hand to hold)
Deal me another hand Lord, this one's very hard
(It's a hard hand
It's a hard hard hand to hold
It's a hard hand)
So hard
(It's a hard hard hand to hold)
So hard
(It's a hard hand...)
