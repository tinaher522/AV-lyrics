Who are you?
Who who, who who?
Who are you?
Who who, who who?
Who are you?
Who who, who who?
Who are you?
Who who, who who?
I woke up in a Soho doorway
A policeman knew my name
He said "You can go sleep at home tonight
If you can get up and walk away"
I staggered back to the underground
And the breeze blew back my hair
I remember throwin' punches around
And preachin' from my chair
Well, who are you?
Who are you?
Who who, who who?
I really wanna know
Who are you?
Who who, who who?
C'mon tell  me who are you
Who are you?
Who who, who who?
'Cause I really wanna know
Who are you?
Who who, who who?
I took a tube back outta town
I went back to the Rollin' Pin
I felt a little like a dying clown
With a streak of Rin Tin Tin
I stretched back and I hiccuped
And looked back on my busy day
Eleven hours in the Tin Pan
God there's got to be another way
But who are you?
Who are you?
Who who, who who?
Oh, who are you?
Who are you?
Who who, who who?
Come on tell me who are you
Who are you?
Who who, who who?
Oh now, who the fuck are you?
Who are you?
Who who, who who?
Who are you?
Ooh wa ooh wa...
Who are you?
Who who, who who?
Who are you?
Who who, who who?
Who are you?
Who who, who who?
Who are you?
Who who, who who?
I really wanna know
Who are you?
Who who, who who?
I really wanna know
Who are you?
Who who, who who?
Come on tell me who are you
Who are you?
Who who, who who?
'Cause I really wanna know
Who are you?
Who who, who who?
I know there's a place you walked
Where love falls from the trees
My heart is like a broken cup
I only feel right on my knees
I spit out like a sewer hole
Yet still receive your kiss
How can I measure up to anyone now
After such a love as this?
Well who are you?
Who are you?
Who who, who who?
come on tell me who are you
Who are you?
Who who, who who?
Oh I really wanna know
Who are you?
Who who, who who?
Tell me tell me who are you
Who are you?
Who who, who who?
Come on, come on, who?
Who are you?
Who who, who who?
Oh who the fuck are you?
Who are you?
Who who, who who?
Who are you?
Who are you?
Who who, who who?
Oh tell me who are you
Who are you?
Who....
I really wanna know
Oh I really wanna know
Come on tell me who are you
You
You
Ow...you!
