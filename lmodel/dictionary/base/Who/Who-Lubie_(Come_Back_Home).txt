<song artist="Who" title="Lubie_(Come_Back_Home)">
I said I, I left my wife and child (Lubie come back home),
And lord my conscience is about to drive me wild (Lubie come back home),
A little voice inside my head goes on and on (Lubie come back home),
Said Lubie Lubie you better go back home.
I said I, I thought I'd make it by myself (Lubie come back home),
And now my baby she got my heart dropped on a shelf (Lubie come back home),
I said I, I still you're my baby now (Lubie come back home),
Said Lubie Lubie you better go back home.
You better go on home (Lubie come back home),
I said yeah Lubie go on home (Lubie come back home),
I said you better go home girl,
Ah yeah you go home.
Go on home home home home home home,
Yeah Lubie go on home home home home home home,
Yeah Lubie go on home home home home home home,
Little bit soft, everybody go soft,
Go on home to see my baby,
Yeah you know that she loves you daddy like crazy.
I say my misses I'm gonna stay what I'm gonna do,
Gonna buy you a monkey and a new dog too yeah,
The guys have got yeah to get 'em to see my baby,
A little bit louder, everybody go on go louder, yeah yeah yeah yeah.
Now Lubie where you been,
I said I, I left my wife and child (Lubie come back home),
And lord my conscience is about to drive me wild (Lubie come back home),
A little voice inside my head goes on and on (Lubie come back home),
Said Lubie Lubie you better go back home.
You better go on home (Lubie go back home),
