<song artist="Who" title="I_Like_Nightmares">
I like nightmares
I like being witless
Watch for the newsflash
Cool eyewitness
Eighty one, eighty two, eighty three, it's happening
Gotta be a fucking fool to blame TV, don't get trapped in
If you're lucky be the same as me
I like nightmares, yes I do
There's a simple way to die they call it news
There's a simple way to fly they call it booze
There's an easy quiet escape just sleep and cruise
It's justifiable rape they say you choose
I like nightmares
I like feeling chick less
Flicking my lighter
Watching life flit west
Eighty one, eighty two, eighty three, it's happening
Can we afford to strike three, don't trust the captain
He's just a boy like me
And I like nightmares, yes I do
There's a common way to weep they say just smoke
You can cry yourself to sleep they say just toke
There's a path that never fails you can't get lost
Don't need roads, you're on rails I'll pay the cost
And I like nightmares, yes I do
We were wasted, but you're only waylaid once
What we tasted was a voucher bag and lunch
We robbed their bank and we took their gold
And our lies in the tank must've sounded old
But we pleaded
I said, "Your honour, we're not chumps
After all, we only did it once!"
We like nightmares
They test our fitness
A full can of goulash
A taint in the mid-west
Eighty one, eighty two, eighty three, it's happening
Nothing floats interest free, don't care what it's wrapped in
You could be abreast like me
And I like nightmares, yes I do
I like nightmares
