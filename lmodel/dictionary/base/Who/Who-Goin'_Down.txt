<song artist="Who" title="Goin'_Down">
I'm goin' down
Down, down, down, down, down
I'm goin' down
Down, down, down, down, down
I've got my head out the window
And my bare feet on the ground
She's gone
Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
She's gone
Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
I've got my head out the window
And my bare feet on the ground
I'm goin' down
Down, down, down, down, down
I'm goin' down
I've got my head out the window
And my bare feet on the ground
