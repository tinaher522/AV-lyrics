<song artist="Who" title="My_Way">
Well, come on, pretty baby, let's go out tonight
Your mom won't have to worry, everything'll be alright
Don't let me hear you talking, just be there when I call
'Cause what I do I do my way or it won't be done at all
Little girl, can you hear what I say?
I'm an easy going guy but I always gotta have my way
Yeah, I was born a tiger, always had my way
Don't ever try to change me this or any other day
Don't let me hear you argue the things I say I do
Don't give me no trouble or you all and I are through
Little girl, can you hear what I say?
Yeah, I'm an easy going guy but I always gotta have my way
Well, come on, pretty baby, let's go out tonight
Your mom won't have to worry, everything'll be alright
Don't let me hear you talking, just be there when I call
'Cause what I do I do my way or it won't be done at all
Little girl, can you hear what I say?
Yeah, I'm an easy going guy but I always gotta have my way
I'm an easy going guy but I always gotta have my way
You better believe it, baby
