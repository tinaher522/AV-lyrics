<song artist="Pink_Floyd" title="Matilda_Mother_(Alternative_Version)">
There was a boy whose name was Jim
His friends, they were very good to him
They gave him tea, and cakes and jam
And slices of delicious ham
Oh Mother tell me more
Why'd'you have to leave me there
Hanging in my infant air, waiting
You only have to read the lines of
Scribbly black and everything shines
The chief defect of Henry King
Was chewing little bits of string
At last he swallowed some which tied
Itself in ugly knots inside
Wondering and dreaming
The words have different meanings
Yes they did
Finding she was left alone
Went tiptoe to the telephone, 999
Summoned the immediate aid
Of London's Noble Fire Brigade
For all the time spent in that room
The doll's house darkness old perfume
And fairy stories held me high
On clouds of sunlight floating by
Oh Mother tell me more
Tell me more
