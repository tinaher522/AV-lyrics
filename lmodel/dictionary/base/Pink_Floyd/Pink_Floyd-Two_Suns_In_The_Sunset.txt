<song artist="Pink_Floyd" title="Two_Suns_In_The_Sunset">
In my rear view mirror the sun is going down
Sinking behind bridges in the road
I think of all the good things that we have left undone
And I suffer premonitions
Confirm suspicions
Of the holocaust to come
The rusty wire that holds the cork that keeps the anger in
Gives way and suddenly it's day again
The sun is in the east even though the day is done
Two suns in the sunset
Could be the human race is run
Like the moment when the brakes lock
And you slide towards the big truck ("Oh no!")
You stretch the frozen moments with your fear
And you'll never hear their voices ("Daddy, Daddy!")
And you'll never see their faces
You have no recourse to the law anymore
And as the windshield melts and my tears evaporate
Leaving only charcoal to defend
Finally I understand the feelings of the few
Ashes and diamonds
Foe and friend
We were all equal in the end
...and now the weather. Tomorrow will be cloudy with scattered showers spreading from the east ... with an expected high of 4000 degrees Celsius..."
