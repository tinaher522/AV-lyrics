<song artist="Pink_Floyd" title="Take_Up_Thy_Stethoscope_And_Walk">
Doctor, doctor, I'm in bed
Doctor, doctor, aching head
Doctor, doctor, gold is lead
Doctor, doctor, choke on bread
Doctor, doctor, underfed
Doctor, doctor, gold is lead
Doctor, doctor, Jesus bled
Doctor, doctor, pain is red
Doctor, doctor, dark doom
Gruel ghoul, greasy spoon
Used spool, June gloom
Why do you go?
And now
Music seems to help the pain
Seems to motivate the brain
Doctor, kindly tell your wife
That I'm alive, flowers thrive
Realise, realise
Realise
