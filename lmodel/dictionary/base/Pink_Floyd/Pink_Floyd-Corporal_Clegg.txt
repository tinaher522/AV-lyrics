<song artist="Pink_Floyd" title="Corporal_Clegg">
Corporal Clegg had a wooden leg
He won it in the war
In nineteen forty four
Corporal Clegg had a medal too
In orange, red and blue
He found it in the zoo
Dear oh dear, oh are they really sad for me?
Dear oh dear, oh will they really laugh at me?
Missus Clegg, you must be proud of him
Missus Clegg, another drop of gin?
Corporal Clegg, umbrella in the rain
He's never been the same
No one is to blame
Corporal Clegg received his medal in a dream
From her Majesty, the Queen
His boots were very clean
Missus Clegg, you must be proud of him
Missus Clegg, another drop of gin?
Corporal Clegg

(Johnny)
Corporal Clegg
(Johnny is on guard)
Corporal Clegg
(All right, men - in you go)
Corporal Clegg
(Left, right, left, right)
Corporal Clegg
(I'm right behind you)
Corporal Clegg
(What are you speaking of? About that leg of yours...)
Corporal Clegg
(You'll excuse me, from now on, what of it?)
Corporal Clegg
(Ha! We got him)
Corporal Clegg
(Johnny Clegg's dead)
Corporal Clegg
Corporal Clegg
