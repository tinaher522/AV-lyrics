<song artist="Pink_Floyd" title="Candy_And_A_Currant_Bun">
Oh my girl sitting in the sun
Go buy candy and a currant bun
I like to see you run
Lay back...
Ooh, don't talk to me
Please, just walk with me
Please, you know I'm feeling frail
It's true, sun shining very bright
It's you who I'm gonna love tonight
Ice cream tastes good in the afternoon
Ice cream tastes good if you eat it soon
Ooh, don't touch me child
Please, you know you drive me wild
(Drive me wild)
Please, you know I'm feeling frail
Don't try another cat
Don't go where other you must know
I'm very very very frail
Oh my girl sitting in the sun
Go buy candy and a currant bun
I like to see you run
And fly...
