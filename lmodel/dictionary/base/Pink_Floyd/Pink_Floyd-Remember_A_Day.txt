<song artist="Pink_Floyd" title="Remember_A_Day">
Remember a day before today
A day when you were young
Free to play along with time
Evening never comes
Sing a song that can't be sung
Without the morning's kiss
Queen you shall be if you wish
Look for your King
Why can't we play today?
Why can't we stay that way?
Climb your favourite apple tree
Try to catch the sun
Hide from your little brother's gun
Dream yourself away
Why can't we reach the sun?
Why can't we blow the years away?
Blow away
Blow away
Remember
Remember
