<song artist="Pink_Floyd" title="Lucy_Leave">
Leave when I ask you to leave, Lucy
Please fall away from me, Lucy
oh, go, little girl
See that I'm so broken up about you, Lucy
Mean treatin' me and done me harm, Lucy
Been in love with you and your charms, Lucy
Oh, go, little girl
I'm in love with you, Lucy
You got my heart, you got my heart, oh no
You tear me apart, you just won't let me go
You hold on so tight, so tight I just can't breathe
Now Lucy leave, Lucy
Leave when I ask you to leave, little girl
Please fall away from me, little girl
yeah, go, little girl
See that I'm so broke up about you, Lucy
Yeah, girl
