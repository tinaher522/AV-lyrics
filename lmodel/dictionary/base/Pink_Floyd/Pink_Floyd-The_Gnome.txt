<song artist="Pink_Floyd" title="The_Gnome">
I want to tell you a story
About a little man if I can
A gnome named Grimble Gromble
And little gnomes stay in their homes
Eating, sleeping, drinking their wine
He wore a scarlet tunic
A blue-green hood, it looked quite good
He had a big adventure
Amidst the grass, fresh air at last
Wining dining biding his time
And then one day
Hooray, another way for gnomes to say
Ooh my...
Look at the sky, look at the river
Isn't it good?
Look at the sky, look at the river
Isn't it good?
Winding, finding places to go
And then one day
Hooray, another way for gnomes to say
Ooh my ooh my...
