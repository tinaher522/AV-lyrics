<song artist="Pink_Floyd" title="Learning_To_Fly">
Into the distance, a ribbon of black
Stretched to the point of no turning back
A flight of fancy on a windswept field
Standing alone, my senses reeled
A fatal attraction is holding me fast
How can I escape this irresistible grasp?
Can't keep my eyes from the circling sky
Tongue-tied and twisted, just an earth-bound misfit, I
Ice is forming on the tips of my wings
Unheeded warnings, I thought I thought of everything
No navigator to find my way home
Unladened, empty and turned to stone
A soul in tension that's learning to fly
Condition grounded but determined to try
Can't keep my eyes from the circling skies
Tongue-tied and twisted, just an earth-bound misfit, I
Friction lock - set
Mixtures - rich
Propellers - fully forward
Flaps - set - ten degrees
Engine gauges and suction - check
Mixture set to maximum percent - recheck
Flight instruments...
Altimeters - check both
Lights - on
Pilot heater - on
Strobes - on
Confirm three-eight-echo ready for departure
Hello again, this is now 129.4
129.4. It's a go
Three-eight-echo cleared takeoff, the wind's normal at ten knots
Three-eight-echo
Easy on the brakes. Take it easy. It's gonna roll this time
Just handle the power gradually, and it...
Above the planet on a wing and a prayer
My grubby halo, a vapour trail in the empty air
Across the clouds I see my shadow fly
Out of the corner of my watering eye
A dream unthreatened by the morning light
Could blow this soul right through the roof of the night
There's no sensation to compare with this
Suspended animation, a state of bliss
Can't keep my mind from the circling sky
Tongue-tied and twisted, just an earth-bound misfit, I
