<song artist="Pink_Floyd" title="Shine_On_You_Crazy_Diamond_(Parts_VI-IX)">
Nobody knows where you are
How near or how far
Shine on you crazy diamond
Pile on many more layers 
And I'll be joining you there
Shine on you crazy diamond
And we'll bask in the shadow of yesterday's triumph 
Sail on the steel breeze
Come on you boy child, you winner and loser
Come on you miner for truth and delusion, and shine!
