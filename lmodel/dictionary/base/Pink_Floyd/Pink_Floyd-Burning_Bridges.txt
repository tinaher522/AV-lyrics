<song artist="Pink_Floyd" title="Burning_Bridges">
Bridges burning brightly
Merging with the shadow
Flickering between the lines
Stolen moments
Floating softly on the air
Borne on wings of fire
And climbing higher
Ancient bonds are breaking
Moving all and changing sides<sup>1</sup>
Dreaming of a new day
Cast aside the other way
Magic vision stirring
Kindled by the burning flames
Rise in her eyes<sup>2</sup>
The door that stands ajar
The walls that once were high
Beyond the gilded cage
Beyond the reach of ties<sup>3</sup>
The moment is at hand
She breaks the golden band
