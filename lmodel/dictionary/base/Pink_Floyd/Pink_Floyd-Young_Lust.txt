<song artist="Pink_Floyd" title="Young_Lust">
I am just a new boy
A stranger in this town
Where are all the good times
Who's gonna show this stranger around?
Ooh I need a dirty woman
Ooh I need a dirty girl
Will some cold woman in this desert land
Make me feel like a real man
Take this rock and roll refugee
Oooh babe, set me free
Ooh I need a dirty woman
Ooh I need a dirty girl
Ooh I need a dirty woman
Ooh I need a dirty girl
Hello?
Yes, a collect call for Mrs. Floyd from Mr. Floyd.
Will you accept the charges from United States?
Oh, he hung up! That's your residence, right? I wonder why he hung up? Is there supposed to be someone else there besides your wife there to answer?
Hello?
This is United States calling, are we reaching...
See? He keeps hanging up, and it's a man answering!
