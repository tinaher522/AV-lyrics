<song artist="Pink_Floyd" title="The_Great_Gig_In_The_Sky">
And I am not frightened of dying. Any time will do, I don't mind.
Why should I be frightened of dying? There's no reason for it, you've gotta go sometime.
If you can hear this whispering, you are dying.
I never said I was frightened of dying.
