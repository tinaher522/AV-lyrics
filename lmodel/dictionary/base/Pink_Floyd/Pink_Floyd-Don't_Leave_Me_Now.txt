<song artist="Pink_Floyd" title="Don't_Leave_Me_Now">
Ooooh babe
Don't leave me now
Don't say it's the end of the road
Remember the flowers I sent
I need you babe
To put through the shredder
In front of my friends
Ooooh babe
Don't leave me now
How could you go?
When you know how I need you<sup>1</sup>
To beat to a pulp on a Saturday night
Ooooh babe
Don't leave me now
How can you treat me this way?
Running away
Ooooh babe<sup>2</sup>
Why are you running away?
Ooooooh babe
Ooooooh babe
Ooooooh babe
(Spoken) (Sound of many TVs coming on, all on different channels)
The Bulls are already out there...
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrgh!
This room will be a bakery. Thought you'd like to know.<sup>3</sup>
