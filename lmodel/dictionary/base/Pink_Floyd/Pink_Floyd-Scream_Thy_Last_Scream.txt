<song artist="Pink_Floyd" title="Scream_Thy_Last_Scream">
Scream thy last scream old woman with a casket
Blam blam your pointers point your pointers
Waddle with apples to crunchy Mrs. Stores
She'll be scrubbing bubbles on all fours
Scream thy last scream old woman with a casket
Fling your arms madly old lady with a daughter
Flack chap chau fauses, mouses, houses
Flittin' and hittin' and fittin' quack quack
Watching the teley till all hours big time
Fling your arms madly old lady with a daughter
(Oh, sock it to me...)
Scream thy last scream old woman with a casket
Blam blam your pointers point your pointers
Waddle with apples to crunchy Mrs. Stores
She'll be scrubbing bubbles on all fours
Scream thy last scream old woman with a casket
