<song artist="Pink_Floyd" title="The_Thin_Ice">
Mamma loves her baby
And daddy loves you too
And the sea may look warm to you babe
And the sky may look blue
Ooooh, babe
Ooooh, babe
Ooooh, baby blue
Ooooh, ooooh, babe
If you should go skating
On the thin ice of modern life
Dragging behind you the silent reproach
Of a million tear stained eyes
Don't be surprised, when a crack in the ice
Appears under your feet
You slip out of your depth and out of your mind
With your fear, flowing out behind you
As you claw the thin ice
