<song artist="Pink_Floyd" title="One_Of_The_Few">
When you're one of the few to land on your feet
What do you do to make ends meet?
(Teach)
Make them mad, make them sad
Make them add two and two
Or make them me, or make them you
Make them do what you want them to
Make 'em laugh, make 'em cry
Make 'em lie down and die
