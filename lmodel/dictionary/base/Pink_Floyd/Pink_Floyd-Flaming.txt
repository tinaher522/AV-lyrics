<song artist="Pink_Floyd" title="Flaming">
Alone in the clouds all blue
Lying on an eiderdown, yippee
You can't see me but I can you
Lazing in the foggy dew
Sitting on a unicorn no fear
You can't hear me but I can you
Watching buttercups cup the light
Sleeping on a dandelion too much
I won't touch you but then I might
Screaming through the starlit skies
Traveling by telephone
Hey ho here we go
Ever so high
Alone in the clouds all blue
Lying on an eiderdown, yippee
You can't see me but I can you
