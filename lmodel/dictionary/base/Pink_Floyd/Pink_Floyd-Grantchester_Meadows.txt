<song artist="Pink_Floyd" title="Grantchester_Meadows">
Icy wind of night be gone
This is not your domain
In the sky a bird was heard to cry
Misty morning whisperings
And gentle stirring sounds
Belied a deathly silence
That lay all around
Hear the lark and harken
To the barking of the dog fox
Gone to ground
See the splashing
Of the kingfisher flashing to the water
And a river of green is sliding
Unseen beneath the trees
Laughing as it passes
Through the endless summer
Making for the sea
In the lazy water meadow
I lay me down
All around me golden sunflakes
Settle on the ground
Basking in the sunshine
Of a by-gone afternoon
Bringing sounds of yesterday
Into this city room
Hear the lark and harken
To the barking of the dog fox
Gone to ground
See the splashing
Of the kingfisher flashing to the water
And a river of green is sliding
Unseen beneath the trees
Laughing as it passes
Through the endless summer
Making for the sea
In the lazy water meadow
I lay me down
All around me golden sunflakes
Covering the ground
Basking in the sunshine
Of a by-gone afternoon
Bringing sounds of yesterday
Into my city room
Hear the lark and harken
To the barking of the dog fox
Gone to ground
See the splashing
Of the kingfisher flashing to the water
A river of green is sliding
Unseen beneath the trees
Laughing as it passes
Through the endless summer
Making for the sea
