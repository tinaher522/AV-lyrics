<song artist="Pink_Floyd" title="Outside_The_Wall">
All alone, or in twos
The ones who really love you
Walk up and down outside the wall
Some hand in hand
And some gathered together in bands<sup>1</sup>
The bleeding hearts and the artists
Make their stand
And when they've given you their all
Some stagger and fall: after all it's not easy
Banging your heart against some mad bugger's
Wall
(Spoken) Isn't this where....<sup>2</sup>
