<song artist="Pink_Floyd" title="Stay">
Stay
And help me to end the day
And if you don't mind
We'll break a bottle of wine
Stick around
And maybe we'll put one down
'Cause I wanna find
What lies behind those eyes
Midnight blue burning gold
A yellow moon is growing cold
I rise
Looking through my morning eyes
Surprised
To find you by my side
Rack my brain
And try to remember your name
To find
The words to tell you goodbye
Morning dues new born day
Midnight blue turned to grey
Midnight blue burning gold
A yellow moon is growing cold
