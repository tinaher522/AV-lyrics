<song artist="Ellie_Goulding" title="This_Love_(Will_Be_Your_Downfall)">
Who are we to be emotional?
Who are we to play with hearts and throw away it all?
Who are we to turn each others heads?
Who are we to find ourselves in other peopleâ€™s beds?
I don't like the way I never listen to myself
I feel like I'm on fire, I'm too shy to cry for help
Oh, I don't think you want me much at all
This love is be and end all
This love will be your downfall
This love is be and end all
This love will be your downfall
I'm feeling down about this love
Who are you to make me feel so good?
Who are we to tell ourselves that we're misunderstood?
Who am I to say I'm always yours?
Who am I to choose the boy that everyone adores?
I don't see a reason why we can't just be apart
Now we're falling on each other like we're always in the dark
Oh, I don't think you know me much at all, all, all, at all
This love is be and end all
This love will be your downfall
This love is be and end all
This love will be your downfall
This love is be and end all
This love will be your downfall
This love is not what you want
This heart will never be yours
This love is be and end all
This love will be your downfall
This love is be and end all
This love will be your downfall
