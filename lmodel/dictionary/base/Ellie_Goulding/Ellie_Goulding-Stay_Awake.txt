<song artist="Ellie_Goulding" title="Stay_Awake">
Take my fate in your hands 
We've got a life that hasn't even began
Something's calling us
We're breaking free
I'm curious I need to see
Like a flash before our eyes we'll leap toward the night
And if it feels like we're dreaming
Believe it, believe it (Yeah)
We don't have to wait till the morning
The sun will never go down (Yeah)
What we'll do it wait forever
We gotta take it now (Yeah)
So stay awake, stay awake
You can stay with us till paradise
So stay awake, stay awake
Hand in hand side by side
While our reflections flicker bodies collide
So full of energy nothing to hide
No need to sleep we come alive
And if we're gonna take this ride we can go wherever we like
And if it feels like we're dreaming
Believe it, believe it (Yeah)
We don't have to wait till the morning
The sun will never go down (Yeah)
What we'll do it wait forever
We gotta take it now (Yeah)
So stay awake, stay awake
You can stay with us till paradise
So stay awake, stay awake
Believe it
Take my fate in your hands 
We've got a life that hasn't even began
Something's calling us
We're breaking free
I'm curious I need to see
Like a flash before our eyes we'll leap toward the night
And if it feels like we're dreaming
Believe it, believe it 
We don't have to wait till the morning
The sun will never go down (Yeah)
What we'll do it wait forever
We gotta take it now (Yeah)
So stay awake, stay awake
You can stay with us till paradise
So stay awake, stay awake
