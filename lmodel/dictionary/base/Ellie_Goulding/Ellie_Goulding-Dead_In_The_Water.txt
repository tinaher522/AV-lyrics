<song artist="Ellie_Goulding" title="Dead_In_The_Water">
If I was not myself
And you were someone else
I'd say so much to you
And I would tell the truth
'Cause I can hardly breathe
When your hands let go of me
The ice is thinning out
And my feat brace themselves
I'm there in the water
Still looking for ya
I'm there in the water
Can't you see?
Can't you see?
You've seen this all before
Life left on the shore
We're smiling all the same
You sail away again
Oh, yeah
I'm dead in the water (I'm dead in the water)
Still looking for ya (Still looking for ya)
I'm dead in the water (I'm dead in the water)
Can't you see? (Can't you see?)
Can't you see?
