<song artist="Ellie_Goulding" title="Believe_Me">
Listen, I can hear the voice
I need a helping hand, just to beat the void
I need a mission, a dream to stop me talking to myself
And now the silence is broken, now my soul is to sell
I need to pick up the pieces, to scatter to the wind
Hold the city to your ears, you can hear the waves come in
You can't change the world with a song
And you can't make it right when it's wrong
I can't stop this music traveling round with me
Wherever I go, it's playing for you
I can't stop this voice unravelling 'round of me
Whatever I do, it's talking to you
The world dances to the rhythm of its own heart
Beating for you, however you lose
So speak to me, believe, believe, believe me
Don't let it slip through your fingertips
When there's a ghost, don't try to reason with it
'Cause now I'm tired, I'm wired, so I won't miss a thing
I wrote my words up to dry, and I've forgotten what to sing
But you can't change the world with a song
You can't make it right when it's wrong
I can't stop this music traveling round with me
Wherever I go, it's playing for you
I can't stop this voice unravelling 'round of me
Whatever I do, it's talking to you
The world dances to the rhythm of its own heart
Beating for you, however you lose
So speak to me, believe, believe, believe me
If that's what it was to you
Then that's what it was to me
If that's what it was to you
Then that's what it was to me
If that's what it was to you
Then that's what it was to me
But you can't change the world with a song
You can't make it right when it's wrong
I can't stop this music traveling round with me
Wherever I go, it's playing for you
I can't stop this voice unravelling 'round of me
Whatever I do, it's talking to you
The world dances to the rhythm of its own heart
Beating for you, however you lose
So speak to me
Believe, believe, believe me
Believe, believe, believe me
