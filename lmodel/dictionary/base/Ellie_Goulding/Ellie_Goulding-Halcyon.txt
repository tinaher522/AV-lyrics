<song artist="Ellie_Goulding" title="Halcyon">
I know it's not over
Baby I worked this out for sure
It's gonna be colder
Now you've forced open the door
I know you better
Than I ever have before
I know you
I know you're a fighter
But you never fought for me
When I was a shelter
But you're not heading home to me
We could be closer
We could be closer
We could be
When it's just us
You show me what it feels like to be lonely
You show me what it feels like to be lost
I take your hand for you to
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go
When it's just us
You show me what it feels like to be lonely
You show me what it feels like to be lost
I take your hand for you to
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go
It's gonna be (It's gonna be better)
And it's gonna be better, it's gonna be better
It's gonna be better, oh, it's gonna be better
It's gonna be better, it's gonna be better (It's gonna be)
It's gonna be better, it's gonna be better
We'll take a long walk
Down the alleys of these houses
And we'll talk
See what conversation rouses
When we're alone
When we're alone
It could be home
When it's just us
You show me what it feels like to be lonely
You show me what it feels like to be lost
I take your hand for you to
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go
It's gonna be (It's gonna be better)
And it's gonna be better, it's gonna be better
It's gonna be better, oh, it's gonna be better
It's gonna be better, it's gonna be better (It's gonna be)
It's gonna be better
It's gonna be (It's gonna be better)
And it's gonna be better, it's gonna be better
It's gonna be better, oh, it's gonna be better
It's gonna be better, it's gonna be better (It's gonna be)
It's gonna be better, it's gonna be better
