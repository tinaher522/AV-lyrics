<song artist="Ellie_Goulding" title="I_Know_You_Care">
Clinging to me
Like a last breath you would breathe
You were like home to me
I don't recognize this street
Please don't close your eyes
Don't know where to look without them
Outside the cars speed by
I've never heard them until now
I know you care
I know it is always been there
But there is trouble ahead, I can feel it
You were just saving yourself when you hide it
Yeah, I know you care
I see it in the way you stare
As if there was trouble ahead and you knew it
I'll be saving myself from the ruin
And I know you care
I used to run down the stairs
To the door and I thought you were there
To shape to the comfort of us
Two lovers locked out of love
Oh, but I know you care
I know it is always been there
But there is trouble ahead, I can feel it
You were just saving yourself when you hide it
Yeah, I know you care
I see it in the way you stare
As if there was trouble ahead and you knew it
I'll be saving myself from the ruin
I know it wasn't always wrong
But I've never known a winter so cold
Now I don't warm my hands in your coat
But I still hope
'Cause this is how things ought to have been
And I know the worst of it
Wasn't all that it seemed
Why can't I dream, why can't I dream?
'Cause I know you care
And I know you care
I know you care, I know you care
I know it's always been there
