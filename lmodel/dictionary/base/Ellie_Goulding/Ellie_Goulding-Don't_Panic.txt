<song artist="Ellie_Goulding" title="Don't_Panic">
Bite down on your lip
Take another sip
(Don't panic)
Stop checking your phone
Looking for the answers
(Don't panic)
Mind running obsessed
Feeling paralyzed
(Don't panic)
Let me watch you undress
Fall into the night
Yeah we change and we change and we feel so lost
And we don't know who we are
Yeah we break and we break and we just can't stop,
So we just keep breaking hearts
Why you wanna ruin a good thing
Can we take it back to the start?
When love's not playing out like the movies
It doesn't mean it's falling apart
Don't panic
Don't panic
Been shattered before
Everything breaks
(Don't)
I can't really be sure
Of our mistakes
(Don't panic)
Come under my love
Like an umbrella
(Don't panic)
Going to make you feel good
Yeah, better than ever
Yeah we change and we change and we feel so lost
And we don't know who we are
Yeah we break and we break and we just can't stop
So we just keep breaking hearts
Why you wanna ruin a good thing
Can we take it back to the start
When love's not playing out like the movies
It doesn't mean it's falling apart
Don't panic
Don't panic
I got big dreams, baby
I got big dreams, baby
So don't you overcomplicate it
I got big dreams, baby
I got big dreams, baby
So don't you, don't you overcomplicate it
Why you wanna ruin a good thing
Can we take it back to the start
When love's not playing out like the movies
It doesn't mean it's falling apart
Don't panic
Don't panic
Don't panic
Don't panic
