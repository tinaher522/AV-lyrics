<song artist="Ellie_Goulding" title="Without_Your_Love">
Sooner or later I'll be heading home
Sooner or later I'll be on my own
June into summer, I'll wear out my shoes
Tune into someone, got nothing to lose
Without your love I'm getting somewhere
Without your love I'm getting somewhere
Without your love I'm getting somewhere
Without your love I'm getting somewhere
Without your love I'm getting somewhere
Move in the sun till I burn all my ties
Hay fever scratching and watery eyes
I think I've been waiting for this all my life
Coldest dark kisses left frozen in time
