Who are we to be emotional? 
Who are we to play with hearts? 
And throw away it all 
Who are we to turn each others heads? 
Who are we to find ourselves in other people's beds? 
I don't like the way I never listen to myself 
I feel like I'm on fire, I'm too shy to cry for help 
I don't think you know me much at all 
This love is be and end all 
This love will be your downfall 
I'm feeling down about this love 
Who are you to make me feel so good? 
Who are we to tell ourselves that we're misunderstood? 
Oh who am I to say I'm always yours 
Who am I to choose the boy that everyone adores 
I don't see a reason why we can't just be apart 
Now we're falling on each other like we're always in the dark 
I don't think you warned me much at all 
This love is be and end all 
This love will be your downfall 
This love is not what you want 
This heart will never be yours 
This love is be and end all 
This love will be your downfall 
This love is be and end all 
This love will be your downfall 
You're so quiet 
But it doesn't faze me 
You're on time 
You move so fast 
Makes me feel lazy 
And let's join forces 
We've got our guns and horses 
I know you've been burnt 
But every fire is a lesson learnt 
I left my house 
Left my clothes 
Door wide open 
Heaven knows 
You're so worth it, you are 
But I wish I could feel it all for you 
I wish I could be it all for you 
If I could erase the pain 
And maybe you'd feel the same 
I'd do it all for you 
I would, I would, I would, I would, I would 
Let’s tie words 
'Cause they amount to nothing 
Play it down 
Pretend you can't take what you've found 
But you found me 
On a screen you sit at permanently 
I left my house 
Left my clothes 
Door wide open 
Heaven knows 
You're so worth it, you are 
But I wish I could feel it all for you 
I wish I could be it all for you 
If I could erase the pain 
And maybe you'd feel the same 
I'd do it all for you 
I would, I would, I would, I would 
It's time to come clean and make sense of everything 
It's time that we found out who we are 
'Cause when I'm standing here in the dark 
I see your face in every star 
But I wish I could feel it all for you 
I wish I could be it all for you 
If I could erase the pain 
And maybe you'd feel the same 
I'd do it all for you 
I would, I would, I would, I would, I would 
I'd do it all for you, I would 
I'd do it all for you, I would 
I'd do it all for you, I would 
I'd do it all for you, I would 
I'd do it all for you 
I had a way then 
Losing it all on my own 
I had a heart then 
But the queen has been overthrown 
And I'm not sleeping now 
The dark is too hard to beat 
And I'm not keeping up 
The strength I need to push me 
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone 
You shine them when I'm alone 
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong 
And dreaming when they're gone 
Cuz they're calling, calling, calling me home 
Calling, calling, calling home 
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone 
You shine them when I'm alone 
Noises, I play within my head 
Touch my own skin 
And hope they'll still be there 
And I think back to when 
My brother and my sister slept 
In another place 
The only time I feel safe 
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone 
You shine them when I'm alone 
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong 
And dreaming when they're gone 
Cuz they're calling, calling, calling me home 
Calling, calling, calling home 
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone 
You shine them when I'm alone 
Lights, lights
Lights, lights
Lights, lights
Lights, lights
Lights, lights
Lights, lights
Lights, lights
Lights, lights
Lights, lights
Lights, lights
Lights, lights
Lights, lights
Lights, lights
Lights, lights
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone 
You shine them when I'm alone 
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong 
And dreaming when they're gone 
Cuz they're calling, calling, calling me home 
Calling, calling, calling home 
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone 
You shine them when I'm alone 
Home, home 
(Lights, lights, lights)... 
You're as sharp as a knife and you fit like a glove 
That is no way to live that is no way to love 
Full of fear in your skin and the weakness in giving in 
Stabbed in the back but you feel no pain 
Push the heaviest doors that you can't open 
Yeah they tied me up and my body lies still, again 
You're as bright as the sun and as bold as the moon 
I don't know when you'll break but it's gonna be soon 
If my will caves in, I'll be in the same boat as you 
I've got the salt skin 
Running to where he is 
Never going to give in 
Even with the strength 
He's stealing salt skin 
Telling me I'm winning wars they 
Created just to understand
"The meaning of" 
Hands on strings and my mouth open 
Find the perfect words that I've not spoken 
And I won't tell the truth unless you want me to 
For all of the times that I lost my head 
When it rolled to the floor and I found it again 
But when it came back, 
I didn't know my own name 
I've got the salt skin 
Running to where he is 
Never going to give in 
Even with the strength 
He's stealing salt skin 
Telling me I'm winning wars they 
Created just to understand
"The meaning of" 
I've got the salt skin 
Running to where he is 
Never going to give in 
Even with the strength 
He's stealing salt skin 
Telling me I'm winning wars they 
Created just to understand 
I've got the salt skin 
Running to where he is 
Never going to give in 
Even with the strength 
He's stealing salt skin 
Telling me I'm winning wars they 
created just to understand... 
"the meaning of" 
Oh, oh, starry eyed 
Hit, hit, hit, hit, hit me with lightning 
Handle bars 
That I let go, let go 
For anyone 
Take me in 
And I'll throw out my heart 
And get a new one 
Next thing, we're touching 
You look at me it's like you hit me with lightning 
Oh 
Everybody's starry eyed 
And everybody glows 
Oh 
Everybody's starry eyed 
And my body goes 
So we burst 
Into colours 
Colours 
And carousels 
Fall head first 
Like paper planes and playground games 
Next thing, we're touching 
You look at me it's like you hit me with lightning 
Oh 
Everybody's starry eyed 
And everybody glows 
Oh 
Everybody's starry eyed 
And my body goes 
Next thing, we're touching 
Next thing, we're touching 
(We come and we go) 
Next thing, we're touching 
Next thing, we're touching 
(But we're not in love) 
Next thing, we're touching 
Next thing, we're touching 
(We come and we go) 
(But we're not in love) 
Next thing, we're touching 
Next thing, we're touching 
Hit me with lightning 
Oh 
Everybody's starry eyed 
And everybody glows 
Oh 
Everybody's starry eyed 
And my body goes 
Oh 
Everybody's starry eyed 
And everybody glows 
Oh 
Everybody's starry eyed 
And my body goes 
Like all the boys before, like all the boys, boys, boys
Like all the boys before, like all the boys, boys, boys
You left your blood stain on the floor 
You set your sights on him 
You left a hand print on the door, 
Like all the boys before, like all the boys before (boys boys boys boys) 
This is our luck, baby, running out 
Her clothes were never off 
We still have hours to run about 
To scale the map, scale the map, to get us back on track 
I've seen you in a fight you lost, I’ve seen you in a fii-ii-ii-ii-ght 
Were under the sheets and you're killing me 
In our house made of paper, your words all over me 
Were under the sheets and you’re killin me 
Like all the boys before, like all the boys, boys, boys
Like all the boys before, like all the boys, boys, boys
In here the world won’t bring us down 
Our plan is golden 
Out there a lonely girl could drown 
In here were frozen 
Where did the people go? 
My hands are empty 
You're not the answer I should know 
Like all the boys before, like all the boys before 
(whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,) 
Were in a mess baby, were in a mess babe 
Your more is less babe (oh, oh) 
Were in a mess baby, were in a mess babe 
Your more is less babe (oh, oh!) 
Were under the sheets and you're killin me 
In our house made of paper, and you're words all over me 
We're under the sheets and you’re killin' me 
(I've seen you in a fight you lost) 
Like all the boys before, like all the boys before 
Were under the sheets and your killing me 
Our house full of paper and you're words all over me 
Were under the sheets and you’re killing me 
(Oh you’re killin me, your killin me!!) 
Were under the sheets and you're killing me 
In our house made of paper, your words all over me 
Were under the sheets and you’re killin me 
(killin me, killin me, killin me) 
Killin me, killin me, killin me 
Oh, oh, starry eyed 
Hit, hit, hit, hit, hit me with lightning 
Handle bars 
That I let go, let go 
For anyone 
Take me in 
And I'll throw out my heart 
And get a new one 
Next thing, we're touching 
You look at me it's like you hit me with lightning 
Oh 
Everybody's starry eyed 
And everybody glows 
Oh 
Everybody's starry eyed 
And my body goes 
So we burst 
Into colours 
Colours 
And carousels 
Fall head first 
Like paper planes and playground games 
Next thing, we're touching 
You look at me it's like you hit me with lightning 
Oh 
Everybody's starry eyed 
And everybody glows 
Oh 
Everybody's starry eyed 
And my body goes 
Next thing, we're touching 
Next thing, we're touching 
(We come and we go) 
Next thing, we're touching 
Next thing, we're touching 
(But we're not in love) 
Next thing, we're touching 
Next thing, we're touching 
(We come and we go) 
(But we're not in love) 
Next thing, we're touching 
Next thing, we're touching 
Hit me with lightning 
Oh 
Everybody's starry eyed 
And everybody glows 
Oh 
Everybody's starry eyed 
And my body goes 
Oh 
Everybody's starry eyed 
And everybody glows 
Oh 
Everybody's starry eyed 
And my body goes
