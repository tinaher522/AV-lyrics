<song artist="Ellie_Goulding" title="Lost_And_Found">
Got to love this field
And the cherry sky
Under blossom clouds
Though it's late July
You don't even try
Still you look so cool
Like a cover boy when you light the moon
Need the countryside
But I just forgot
All the things that matter
I forget a lot
I get so caught up
In the city crowd
But this place is still my first love
Is there anybody out there
Waiting for me on my way
If that somebody is you
Then baby I just want to say
Tonight, nothing will bring us down
Tonight, we're at the lost and found
Guess I need to run
Take me to the bus
But don't let me go
No, don't let me on
Got to hold me tight
Won't put up a fight
Of course I'll stay
I'll stay the night
Is there anybody out there
Waiting for me on my way
If that somebody is you
Then baby I just want to say
Tonight, nothing will bring us down
Tonight, we're at the lost and found
We're at the lost and found
We're at the lost and found
Is there anybody out there
Waiting for me on my way
If that somebody is you
Then baby I just want to say
Tonight, nothing will bring us down
Tonight, we're at the lost and found
We're at the lost and found
We're at the lost and found
