<song artist="Ellie_Goulding" title="Escalante">
Somewhere in the world
Anyway far from here
Wanting home tonight
Feeling the cold fear
I don't speak as you do
I don't even know who I am (Who am I?)
My hands are getting colder
Your temper's gettin' older
Where are you going to?
Are you trying to take off it?
My heart is always searching
But you're not climbing
Carry up to me (Escalante)
Hold the air I breathe (Escalante)
What you say you said? (Escalante)
A steep mountain
And your stones were stained with my poison
Escalante
The whole shit is coming back from me
A fingerprint decayed with hate
If you love me, you should show me
How to reconsider what I did
Take me again, again and again
To the place where there's no dark
I can't steal your sight again
But I can kill you in the dark
Carry up to me (Escalante)
Hold the air I breathe (Escalante)
What you say you said? (Escalante)
A steep mountain
And your stones were stained with my poison
Escalante
Carry up to me (Escalante)
Hold the air I breathe (Escalante)
What you say you said? (Escalante)
A steep mountain
And your stones were stained with my poison
Again and again
Carry up to me (know you know it)
Hold me, hold me (I'm feeling empty)
What do we have done (breaking the relief)
A steep mountain, and you know I love it
Escalante
