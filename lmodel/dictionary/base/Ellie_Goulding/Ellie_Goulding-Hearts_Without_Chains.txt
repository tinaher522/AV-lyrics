<song artist="Ellie_Goulding" title="Hearts_Without_Chains">
You wake up I know it's time to go
With a spinning head I lie and watch you smoke
Change the hands on my watch and hold you close
This misery is weightless as a stone
Have you lost the same things I have lost?
Do you know the panic I know?
And would I see the terror in your face?
Do you know that fever I know?
I wish time was still we'd stay right here
With time to kill in our hearts without chains
And if time was still we'd have no fear
Or scars to heal in our hearts without chains
In our hearts without chains
You left everything behind except yourself
And all I see is question marks and nothing else
You must've landed in New York by now
Please don't bring this love down
Have you lost the same things I have lost?
Do you know the panic I know?
And would I see the terror in your face?
Do you know that fever I know?
I wish time was still we'd stay right here
With time to kill in our hearts without chains
And if time was still we'd have no fear
Or scars to heal in our hearts without chains
In a house without chains
Don't bring this love down
Don't bring this love down
Don't bring this love down
Don't bring this love down
I wish time was still we'd stay right here
With time to kill in our hearts without chains
And if time was still we'd have no fear
Or scars to heal in our hearts without chains
In our hearts without chains
In our hearts without chains
