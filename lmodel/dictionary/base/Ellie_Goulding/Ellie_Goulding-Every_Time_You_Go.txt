<song artist="Ellie_Goulding" title="Every_Time_You_Go">
Every time you go, go, go, go
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
It starts with a picture and it sits in your frame
And we part with a letter and it ends in my name
And it starts with forever and it ends with a touch
And I know that you're clever and I don't ask for much
Ooh...
Maybe we forgot all the things we are
When we are together
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
You said I'm arresting, you said I had heat
I really thought that we'd go further the second time we meet
'Cause I'm tired of trying to keep you - all I want to do is sleep
And perhaps when I'm sleeping you'll get back on your feet
Ooh...
Maybe we forgot all the thing we are
When we are together
Wake me up, wake me up
Stop my fall every time you go
Tape me up then break me up
Ever so gently when I'm at my weakest
It's not so hard every time you go
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I run out to meet you when I knew the storm had come
And I felt the rain on your face and the damage you had done
I know what you're thinking - it will never be the end
And when the storm is over, you won't see me again
Ooh...
Didn't know the price I'd paid for all the times I stayed
When we were together
Wake me up, wake me up
Stop my fall every time you go
Tape me up then break me up
Ever so gently when I'm at my weakest
It's not so hard
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Maybe we forget, are we awake or not?
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Maybe we forget, are we awake or not?
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Maybe we forget, are we awake or not?
Or maybe we forgot
Wake me up, wake me up
Stop my fall every time you go
Tape me up then break me up
Ever so gently when I'm at my weakest
Wake me up, wake me up
Stop my fall every time you go
Tape me up then break me up
Ever so gently when I'm at my weakest
It's not so hard every time you go
