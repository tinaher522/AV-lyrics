<song artist="Ellie_Goulding" title="Let_It_Die">
Headlights flashing, cold eyes 
Know your bullets fly through the night
Broken doors falling, and hotel floors 
I was never yours, never mine
All I said was "Hello, hello"
You just stood and watched me cry to pass the time
And all I said was "Hello, hello"
Tell me how to say "goodbye", cause it's goodbye
I can't stay on my knees
Give me some mercy, please
It's alright
Let it die
I wanted everything
More than your love could give
It's alright
Let it die
See change whispers in the waves
Watch my sorrows drown peacefully
And empires crumble to the shores
I was never yours, never mine
All I said was "Hello, hello"
You just stood and watched me cry to pass the time
And all I said was "Hello, hello"
Tell me how to say "goodbye", cause it's goodbye
I can't stay on my knees
Give me some mercy, please
It's alright
Let it die
I wanted everything
More than your love could give
It's alright
Let it die
I can't stay on my knees
Give me some mercy, please
It's alright
Let it die
I wanted everything
More than your love could give
It's alright
Let it die
I can't stay on my knees (on my knees)
Give me some mercy, please
It's alright
Let it die (it's alright)
I wanted everything
More than your love could give
It's alright
Let it die
