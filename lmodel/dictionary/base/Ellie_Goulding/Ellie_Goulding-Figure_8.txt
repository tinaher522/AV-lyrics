<song artist="Ellie_Goulding" title="Figure_8">
Breathe your smoke into my lungs
In the back of a car with you, I stare into the sun
Still not too old to die young
But lovers hold on to everything
And lovers hold on to anything
I chase your love around a figure eight
I need you more than I can take
You promise forever and a day
And then you take it all away
Way, way, way, way
(And then you take it all away)
Way, way, way, way
Place a kiss on my cheekbone
Then you vanish me, I'm buried in the snow
But something tells me I'm not alone
But lovers hold on to everything
And lovers hold on to anything
I chase your love around a figure eight
I need you more than I can take
You promise forever and a day
And then you take it all away
Way, way, way, way
(And then you take it all away)
Way, way, way, way
So lovers hold on to everything
And lovers hold on to anything
So lovers hold on to everything
And lovers hold on to anything
I chase your love around a figure eight
I need you more than I can take
You promise forever and a day
And then you take it all away
I chase your love around a figure eight
I need you more than I can take
You promise forever and a day
And then you take it all away
Way, way, way, way
(And then you take it all away)
Way, way, way, way
