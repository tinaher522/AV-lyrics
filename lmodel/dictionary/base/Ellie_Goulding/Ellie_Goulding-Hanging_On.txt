<song artist="Ellie_Goulding" title="Hanging_On">
Solo Version
Ellie Goulding:
You know we can get away
Because I'm calling your name
Every day I feel this pain
But you just turn and walk away
No, I just can't keep hanging on
To you and me
I just don't know what is wrong
With you and me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Touch me and then turn away
And put your hands into the flame
Tell me if you feel this pain
'Cause I don't wanna be a ball and chain
No, I just can't keep hanging on
To you and me
I just don't know what is wrong
With you and me
I just can't keep hanging on
To you and me, you and me, you and me
Tinie Tempah:
Yeah, give me the respect
Forgive me and forget
I've gotta get a grip
Living on the edge
I barely even know this fuckin' woman in my bed
And if there's too much on my plate, then I ain't finishing my veg
And if anybody said the grass is greener on the other side
Well it ain't, swear on my mother's life
You got me wrapped up in your shit, I'm feeling mummified
I've only had this fuckin' feeling in my stomach twice
Ellie Goulding:
(To you and)
Tinie Tempah:
You gave me what I needed
And I gave her everything she wanted
There's something about your cleavage
Now I can't put my fingers on it
You're taking me the deepest
I thought she was gonna vomit
If all women from Venus
Then I guess I really got a rocket
You've got a noose around my neck but I'm still hanging on
We've nearly reached the finish line up in our marathon
I spat a verse, she sang a song
She broke my heart I took some Gaviscon
Ellie Goulding:
I just can't keep hanging on
To you and me, with you and me, with you and
