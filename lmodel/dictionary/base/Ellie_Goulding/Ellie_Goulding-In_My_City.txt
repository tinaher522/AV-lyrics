<song artist="Ellie_Goulding" title="In_My_City">
And if I ever had a wish in the whole world
I would’ve listened to my brother when he spoke to me
And I never would’ve played with my conscience
In the fields where I was in their company
But you gave me wings and I used them
I used them, I used them on my youth
And you gave me wings and I used them
I used them, and I won’t lose them
Now I found my feet
Count to one, two, three
And I’m taking off tonight, now I’m free
As I walk my feet on the cold concrete
And I, and I, and I
I can feel my dreams when I’m in my city, eh eh eh
I fall on my knees for my, for my city, eh
We go on every dream in my, in my city, eh eh eh
And that’s where I’ll stay
And that’s where I’ll stay
In my city, eh eh eh
I wandered down the streets with my new town
With the lights blinding and my heart weighed down
I think I'll get a job receiving people's thunder
For the folks back home, I will make them proud
But you gave me wings and I used them
I used them, I used them on my youth
Yeah, you gave me wings and I used them
I used them, I don't wanna lose them
I don't wanna lose them
I can feel my dreams when I’m in my city, eh eh eh
I fall on my knees for my, for my city, eh
We go on every dream in my, in my city, eh eh eh
And that’s where I’ll stay
And that’s where I’ll stay
In my city, eh eh eh
Shoulders ache for want of wings
My city shakes the fear in me
I can feel my dreams when I’m in my city, eh eh eh
I fall on my knees for my, for my city, eh
We go on every dream in my, in my city, eh eh eh
And that’s where I’ll stay
And that’s where I’ll stay
In my city, eh eh eh
