<song artist="Ellie_Goulding" title="Wish_I_Stayed">
Why can't we speak another language, one we all agree on?
Why when men look outside do they see houses,
Instead of the fields they grew from?
We are constantly uprooted from them, making us tiresome and fearful
Can you get up right now, endeavor to free-fall
'Cause you can fall if you want to 
It's just a matter of how far
You treasured our home town
But you've forgotten where you are
And it will stay with you until your mind's been found
And it has been found wandering around
With that skipping rope, the trampoline
The crafty smoke that made us choke
But we didn't give up hope
It's the simple ways of getting paid
The carelessness of running away
And I wish I stayed
I wish I stayed
I wish I stayed
Patterns all arranged in my background
These pillars and posts keeping this country on form
Letters were all sent with no addresses
So that people can't discover
We're always undercover
Why do I always draw triangles
Instead of words this paper so deserves?
'Cause you see
I don't own my clothes but I own my mind
And it's not what you've lost
But it's what you find.
You found that skipping rope, the trampoline
The crafty smoke that made us choke
But we didn't give up hope
It's the simple ways of getting paid
The carelessness of running away
And I wish I stayed
I wish I stayed
I wish I stayed
'Cause you can fall if you want to
It's just a matter of how far
You've treasured our home town
But you've forgotten where you are
And it will stay with you until your mind's been found
And it has been found wandering around
With that skipping rope, the trampoline
The crafty smoke that made us choke
But we didn't give up hope
It's the simple ways of getting paid
The carelessness of running away
And I wish I stayed
I wish I stayed
I wish I stayed
