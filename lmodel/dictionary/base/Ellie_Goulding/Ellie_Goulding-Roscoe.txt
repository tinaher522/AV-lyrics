<song artist="Ellie_Goulding" title="Roscoe">
Stonecutters made them from stones
Chosen specially for you and I
Who will live inside
The mountaineers gathered tinder piled high 
In which to take along
Driving many miles, knowing they'd get here 
When they got here, all exhausted 
On the roof leaks they got started 
And now when the rain comes, we can be thankful 
Ooh, ah, ooh
When the mountaineers saw that everything fit
They were glad, and so they took off
Thought we were due
For a change or two
Around this place
When they get back, they're all mixed up with no one to stay with 
The village used to be all one really needs 
Now it's filled with hundreds and hundreds of chemicals
That mostly surround you 
You wish to flee, but it's not like you 
So listen to me, listen to me 
Oh, oh, and when the morning comes
We will step outside 
We will not find another man in sight
We like the newness, the newness of all 
That has grown in our garden soaking for so long 
Whenever I was a child
I wondered what if my name had changed
Into something more productive like Roscoe 
Been born in 1891 
Waiting with my Aunt Rosaline 
Thought we were due
For a change or two 
Around this place
When they get back, they're all mixed up with no one to stay with 
Oh
1891
They roamed around and foraged
They made their house from cedars
They made their house from stone
Oh, they're a little like you
And they're a little like me
We have all we need
Thought we were due
For a change or two 
Around this place 
This place, this place
When they get back, they're all mixed up with no one to stay with
When they get back, they're all mixed up with no one to stay with
