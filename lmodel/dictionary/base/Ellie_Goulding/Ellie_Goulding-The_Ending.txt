<song artist="Ellie_Goulding" title="The_Ending">
If you lock me out
If you lock me out
If you lock me out
If you lock me out
If you lock me out
Me out
I'm living on the wild side
I've never seen a footprint
In the land of rivers
You're my only bridge
And I feel the fear in me
And I don't wanna fall asleep
When I turn into someone else
I know that it can't be beat
If you lock me out
If you lock me out
If you lock me out
If you lock me out
If you lock me out
If you lock me out
If you lock me out
If you lock me out
If you lock 
If you lock
If you lock 
If you lock 
If you lock me
Will you know I am?
(If you lock me)
Will you know you are?
(If you lock me)
Will you know I am?
(If you lock me)
Will you know you are?
I think I've been praying
The lights won't go out
My body's getting colder
As I follow this road down
If you lock me out
(There won't be anything to hold)
If you lock me out
(There won't be anything to hold on)
If you lock me out
(There won't be anyone in the end)
If you lock me out
(There won't be anyone in the end)
If you lock me out
(There won't be anything to hold)
If you lock me out
(There won't be anything to hold on)
If you lock me out
(There won't be anyone in the end)
If you lock me out
(There won't be anyone in the ending)
