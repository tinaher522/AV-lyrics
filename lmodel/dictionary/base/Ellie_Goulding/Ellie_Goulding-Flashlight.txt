<song artist="Ellie_Goulding" title="Flashlight">
Do you remember boy when you were so cruel
When you played the thief and I played the fool
Gonna make you move, make you move, make you move
Been so long crying over you
Now I'm coming your way
Gonna make you move, gonna make you move, make you move, make you move
Chasing faces in the sand
Now your dagger is in my hand
I'll make you move, I'll make you move, I'll make you move
I'll make you run faster, faster, faster
Flashlight
Flashlight
Get out of my way, get out of my way 'cause I can't lose
I'll make you run faster, faster, faster
Flashlight
Flashlight
Get out of my way, get out of my way
I'm coming through
I'll make you run fa-, I'll make you run fa-
I'll make you run fa-, I'll make you run fa-
Coming down on you with a flashing light
There's nowhere to run maybe you can't hide
Gonna make you move, make you move, make you move
It's too late now the tables turned
There's no going back and you'll never learn
Unless I make you move, I make you move, I make you move
And you think I'm still broken hearted
But you'll never win the war you started
You'd better open your eyes
Faster , faster, faster
Flashlight
Flashlight
Get out of my way, get out of my way 'cause I can't lose
I'll make you run faster, faster, faster
Flashlight
Flashlight
Get out of my way, get out of my way
I'm coming through
And you think I'm still broken hearted
But you'll never win the war you started
You'd better open your eyes
I'll make you run
I'll make you run
I'll make you run
I'll make you run
I'll make you run
I'll make you run
Faster , faster, faster
Flashlight
Flashlight
Get out of my way, get out of my way 'cause I can't lose
I'll make you run faster, faster, faster
Flashlight
Flashlight
Get out of my way, get out of my way
I'm coming through
I'll make you run faster, faster, faster
Flashlight
Flashlight
Get out of my way, get out of my way 'cause I can't lose
I'll make you run faster, faster, faster
Flashlight
Flashlight
Get out of my way, get out of my way
I'm coming through
Get out of my way, get out of my way
I'm coming through
