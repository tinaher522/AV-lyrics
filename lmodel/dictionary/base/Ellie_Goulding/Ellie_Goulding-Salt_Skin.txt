<song artist="Ellie_Goulding" title="Salt_Skin">
You're sharp as a knife
And you fit like a glove
That is no way to live
That is no way to love
Full of fear in your skin
And the weakness in giving in
You're stabbed in the back
But you feel no pain
Push the heaviest doors
That you can't open
Yeah, they tied me up
And my body lies still again
You're as bright as the sun
And as calm as the moon
I don't know when you'll break
But it's gonna be soon
If my will caves in
I'll be in the same boat as you
I've got the salt skin
Running to where he is
Never going to give in
Even with the strength
He's stealing salt skin
Telling me I'm winning
Wars they created just to understand
"The meaning of"
Hands on strings
And my mouth open
Find the perfect words
That I've not spoken
And I won't tell the truth
Unless you want me to
For all of the times
That I lost my head
When it rolled to the floor
And I found it again
But when it came back
No, I didn't know my own name
I've got the salt skin
Running to where he is
Never going to give in
Even with the strength
He's stealing salt skin
Telling me I'm winning
Wars they created just to understand
"The meaning of"
I've got the salt skin
Running to where he is
Never going to give in
Even with the strength
He's stealing salt skin
Telling me I'm winning
Wars they created just to understand
I've got the salt skin
Running to where he is
Never going to give in
Even with the strength
He's stealing salt skin
Telling me I'm winning
Wars they created just to understand
"The meaning of"
The meaning
