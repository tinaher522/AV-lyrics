<song artist="Ellie_Goulding" title="Only_You">
Mm, mm, mm-mm-mm-mm
Mm, mm, mm-mm-mm-mm
Mm, mm, mm-mm-mm-mm
Mm, mm, mm-mm-mm-mm
Only you can be
The aching in my heart, my enemy
The only animal I couldn't fight
You hold me in the dark when storms arrive
Only you
Only you can see 
The emptiness I feel when you're with me
When everything you say I'm on my knees
Baby, I'm on my knees
Baby, I'm on my knees
Baby, I'm on my knees
Mm, mm, mm-mm-mm-mm
Mm, mm, mm-mm-mm-mm
Mm, mm, mm-mm-mm-mm
Mm, mm, mm-mm-mm-mm
When everything you say I'm on my knees
Baby, I'm on my knees
Baby, I'm on my knees
Baby, I'm on my knees (Only you)
Only you can be
The aching in my heart, my enemy
The only animal I couldn't fight
You hold me in the dark when storms arrive
Only you
(I am ready to love, I'm ready to love)
(I'm ready to love, I'm ready) Only you
(I am ready to love, I'm ready to love)
(I'm ready to love, I'm ready) Only you
Only you can see 
The emptiness I feel when you're with me
When everything you say I'm on my knees
Baby, I'm on my knees
Baby, I'm on my knees
Baby, I'm on my knees
Only you
Mm, mm, mm-mm-mm-mm
Mm, mm, mm-mm-mm-mm
Mm, mm, mm-mm-mm-mm
Mm, mm, mm-mm-mm-mm
When everything you say I'm on my knees
Baby, I'm on my knees
Baby, I'm on my knees
Baby, I'm on my knees
Only you
Only you can be
The aching in my heart, my enemy
The only animal I couldn't fight
You hold me in the dark when storms arrive
Only you
(I am ready to love, I'm ready to love)
(I'm ready to love, I'm ready)
(I am ready to love, I'm ready to love)
(I'm ready to love, I'm ready)
Only you, only you
(I am ready to love, I'm ready to love)
Only you, only you
(I'm ready to love, I'm ready)
Only you, only you
(I am ready to love, I'm ready to love)
Only you, only you
(I'm ready to love, I'm ready)
Only you can be
The aching in my heart, my enemy
The only animal I couldn't fight
You hold me in the dark when storms arrive
Only you
