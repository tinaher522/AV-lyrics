<song artist="Ellie_Goulding" title="You_My_Everything">
Could've given me something
You my everything
You left me kneeling
I'm just one of those people
You my everything
For what it's worth
For what it's worth
For what it's worth
You were my backbone when my body ached with weariness
You were my hold down when my heart was filled with loneliness
And just as the dark was rising I heard you close the door again
And just as the light turned south I knew who I dream of
Could've given me something
You my everything
You left me kneeling
I'm just one of those people
You my everything
You my everything
You my everything
You are my only hope
The truth, the dare, the consequence
I know you don't feel the same you're sensible and it doesn't make sense
I know I'm gonna wait my heart out you know I'm gonna try much harder
But it isn't the shit in my head that's holding me under this time
Could've given me something
You my everything
You left me kneeling
I'm just one of those people
You my everything
You my everything
You my everything
You my everything
You my everything
You my everything
You my everything
You my everything
You my everything
Could've given me something
You my everything
You left me kneeling
I'm just one of those people
You my everything
You my everything
You my everything
