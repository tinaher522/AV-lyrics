<song artist="Ellie_Goulding" title="Animal">
I've shown you all the places I'm dreaming of
I'll take you to the ocean, I'll bring the sun
We are 17, we have just begun
I have loved to fight for and then some
You are the one, the one, the one, the one
The one, the one, the one, the one
Wake up in the morning, we're paralyzed
We'll fly into the garden like butterflies
There will be no blood and there'll be no pain
I want to fall in love with you again, again, again, again
Again, again, again, again
You have stolen all my senses
There's a fever in my heart
And you are taking my defenses
You are pulling me apart
Forever we are and we are dying
And we will be standing on our ground
So I will take away my feeling
I will be an animal, an animal, an animal
I'll tie you in my arms, I will smother you
We'll tell each other lies, I will tell the truth
I'll colour in the sky, and I'll colour you
I want to join your skin again, again, again, again
Again, again, again, again
You have stolen all my senses
There's a fever in my heart
And you are taking my defenses
You are pulling me apart
Forever we are and we are dying
And we will be standing on our ground
So I will take away my feeling
I will be an animal, an animal
We will run away from danger
We will run away
I-I-I-I-I, I will have to fight for...
You have stolen all my senses
There's a fever in my heart
And you are taking my defenses
You are pulling me apart
Forever we are and we are dying
And we will be standing on our ground
So I will take away my feeling
I will be an animal, an animal
