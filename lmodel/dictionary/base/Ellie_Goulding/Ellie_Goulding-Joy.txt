<song artist="Ellie_Goulding" title="Joy">
Stood in the rain and watched you go
I feel a lump in my throat
And this is far from joy
I never seem to learn
That high makes things harder
That high I get from you
I've figured out the joy is not in your arms
I know I'll always ache with an empty heart
I think it's time to run 'cause I'm seeing stars
I'm seeing stars watch me fall apart
I think of dying all the time
But I've got joy to take my side
Fear is my favourite
Oh, and then you'll see
