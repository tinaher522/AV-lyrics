<song artist="Ellie_Goulding" title="Human">
Human, behave yourself, you have burst at the seams 
Let it all fall out, open your mouth
Often I lie wide awake, think of things I can make
But I don't seem to have the parts to build them
Human, I wonder why you're a better make
Than I could ever build or create, you know not love or hate
I am so scared of what will kill me in the end
For I am not prepared, I hope I will get the chance
To be someone, to be human 
Look what we've done, look what we've done
I would give my life to be (Human)
I would give my life to be (Human)
I would give my life to be (Human)
I would give my life to be (Human)
Human, I'm trying to come clean, I will be a better me
I will not drink until I'm dead, I'll make the most of it
I don't know what it's like to be alive, to say goodbye
To cry a thousand times because my ears won't listen
Human, I'm trying not to lose my faith in you
I've sussed out all that I've seen through, I've sailed an ocean
I am so scared of what I'll look like in the end
For I am not prepared, I hope I will get the chance
To be someone, to be human
Look what we've done, look what we've done
I would give my life to be (Human)
I would give my life to be (Human)
I would give my life to be (Human)
I would give my life to be (Human)
I used to hear it all so loud, the sound of my heart breaking
The truth is waiting to be found, I trust that I will take it 
I would give my life
I would give my life (Human)
I would give my life (Human)
I would give my life (Human)
I would give my life to be (Human)
I would give my life to be (Human)
I would give my life to be (Human)
I would give my life to be (Human)
