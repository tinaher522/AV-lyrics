<song artist="Ellie_Goulding" title="Atlantis">
This is new
Feels unused
I've never met anyone like you
Frightening
Feeling naked
Sensing, searching something sacred
I'll forget you not
I'll forget you not
I'll forget you not
I'll look for you, baby
Where did you go?
Where did you go?
Where did you go?
Go
Where did you go?
Where did you go?
I'm exhausted with loving
No fight in me, I'm defeated
I know I'm fooled, I can't help it
You make my heart so helpless
I'll forget you not
I'll forget you not
I'll look for you
For you, maybe
