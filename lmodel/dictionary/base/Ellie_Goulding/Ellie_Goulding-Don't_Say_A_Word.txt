<song artist="Ellie_Goulding" title="Don't_Say_A_Word">
What if you never said anything?
If you never said anything?
If you never, if you never
If you never, if you never said anything?
If you never, if you never
If you never, if you never
If you never, if you never
If you never, if you never
Here it is in my hands
In my veins and over lands
It spreads like fire, seeking air
To pull me in my own fanfare
Won't you come, won't you come
Won't you come, just don't say a word
Won't you come, won't you come
Won't you come, just don't say a word
If you never, if you never
Just don't say a word
If you never, if you never
Just don't say a word
I'm more alive than I've ever been
So, now I give you all my sins
Chosen you, I've chosen you
But don't say a word
And if I save us and I fall down
I will leave your words behind now
If you never held me under
If you never hear my thunder
