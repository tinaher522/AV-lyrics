<song artist="Ellie_Goulding" title="The_End">
We've only ever kissed lying down
We've only ever touched
When there's no one else around
I can be elusive if you want me to
I'm not being intrusive
I just wish I knew the truth
As to why 
I wait for you
Longer than the average person would
And why
I think about you 
More than I think one should
Our body's fit together like a makeshift puzzle
And It's clear to see why you puzzle me
when you turn your frame
And you whisper my name
As though I am a burden
And I know
and I know
this will happen again and again
so don't let us pretend that this is the end
this is the end
this is the end
I am at your house
So I belong to you for now
Trying to impress you 
But lord I don't know how
I can be a statue if you want me to
I'm not being difficult I just need to know the truth
As to why
I'm wanting you
And I would take you away if I could
And why I'm still here
It's something I still haven't understood
Our hands press together like pieces of paper
But they're always blank when I hold your hand
And it gave you a fright
When I stayed the night
Cus you gave yourself to me
And I'm making up for last time
And I'm making up for you
And I'm waking up from last night
And I'm waking up with you
So what's new
So what's new
So what's new
Our hands press together like pieces of paper
But they're always blank when I hold your hand
And it gave you a fright
When I stayed the night
Cus you gave yourself to me
And I'm making up for last time
And I'm making up for you
And I'm waking up from last night
And I'm waking up with you
So what's new
So what's new
So what's new
So what's new
