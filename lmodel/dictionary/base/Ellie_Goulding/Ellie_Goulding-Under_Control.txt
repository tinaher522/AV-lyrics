<song artist="Ellie_Goulding" title="Under_Control">
I'll never forget that feeling
When I watched you disappear
When you made me stop believing
I could fight away the fear
Now the smoke has cleared and the end is near, it was my illusion
Like a broken dream, I was incomplete
But your love was never the missing piece
I feel like I'm breathing again
I feel like I'm seeing again
I feel like I'm breathing again
I got it under control-ol-ol
I got it under control-ol-ol
I got it under control-ol-ol
All that's real is faded
Like a car into the night
Like a painkiller, I take it
And I watch the world ignite
