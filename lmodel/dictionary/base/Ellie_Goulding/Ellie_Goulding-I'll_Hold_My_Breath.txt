<song artist="Ellie_Goulding" title="I'll_Hold_My_Breath">
Breathe air you're not used to 
Tread floors you don't fall through 
Make waves, you crash a cymbal hard 
Follow no one, always play the wrong card
 
Waste days, in foreign places 
Shed light, on your better side 
Reassure me that you'll wait for me
Wait for me as long as it takes 
And I'll hold my breath, I'll hold my breath 
Until you see me in your dreams 
We'll stay awake beneath the trees 
We'll watch the buildings turn to dust 
A sky of diamonds just for us
You are the risk I'll always take 
The only branch I'll never break 
Those fears, we'll blow them all way 
We'll blow them all away 
Fight fires in your best clothes 
Touch skin with your eyes closed 
Chase thunder, with the volume down 
Pack a suitcase, wander to the next town 
Force quit, on your losing streak 
Solve a riddle in a magazine, be tongue in cheek 
Tell me that we're still too young
That we're still too young and I'll hold my tongue 
Until you see me in your dreams 
We'll stay awake beneath the trees 
We'll watch the buildings turn to dust 
A sky of diamonds just for us 
You are the risk I'll always take 
The only branch I'll never break 
Those fears, we'll blow them all way 
We'll blow them all away 
I'm here, I'm here to take you 
I'll swim, I will swim to save you 
No fall, I'm here to catch you 
I'll swim, I will swim to save you 
Until you see me in your dreams 
We'll stay awake beneath the trees 
We'll watch the buildings turn to dust 
A sky of diamonds just for us 
You are the risk I'll always take 
The only branch I'll never break 
Those fears, we'll blow them all way 
We'll blow them all away
