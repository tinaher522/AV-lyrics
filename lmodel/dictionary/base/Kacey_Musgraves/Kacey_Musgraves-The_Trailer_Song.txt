<song artist="Kacey_Musgraves" title="The_Trailer_Song">
You say that you're watching the birds out the window
Well I've got a bird you can watch
You ain't gotta act like you're borrowing eggs
Just to see if my dishes are washed
What's it to you if it's Wednesday at noon
And I've traded my iced tea for scotch
Keep your two cents on your side of the fence
Girl we ain't friends we're just neighbors
Nothing to see here
Go back to your trailer
You ain't gotta ask what I did to my hair
Or whose underwear's on the line
It ain't mine
I ain't gonna ask whose been mowing your grass
So you ain't gotta ask who mows mine
Quit judging my job and my car and my clothes
Get your nose out of your many blinds
Keep your two cents on your side of the fence
Girl we ain't friends we're just neighbors
There ain't nothing to see here
Go back to your trailer
Don't ask me if I go to church
I won't ask if your husband's still out of work
Try and claim high society
We get our mail on the same side of the street
So keep your two cents on your side of the fence
Girl we ain't friends we're just neighbors
There ain't nothing to see here
Go back to your trailer
There ain't nothing to see here
Go back to your trailer
