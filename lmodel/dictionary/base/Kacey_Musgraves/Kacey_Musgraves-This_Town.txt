(Spoken)
We had a girl that came in with a drug overdose the other day
And she got real belligerent
And she bit one of the nurses (oh man)
And, I mean, she bit (ohhh)
You could see every tooth (nooo! Hehe)
It took two or three of us to get her off of her
It's a crazy wednesday
We finally got a flashing light, they put it in last year
And everybody got real happy when the grocery store got here
And last time the census men came
A-knockin', we were busting at the seams
Aw, but don't you forget it, as big as we're getting
This town's too small to be mean
Big enough for a zip code, a vfw
A good mexican restaurant, a beauty shop or two
Got a methodist, a baptist, and a church of the nazarene
Aw, but don't you forget it, as big as we're getting
This town's too small to be mean
Yeah, it's too dang small to be mean
Too small to be lying
Way too small to cheat
Way too small for secrets
Cause they're way too hard to keep
And somebody's mama knows somebody's cousin
And somebody's sister knows somebody's husband
And somebody's daughter knows somebody's brother
And around here, we all look out for each other
You'll end up in the paper, wreck your family name
What goes around comes back around by friday's football game
We only got one sheriff, but we all know how to keep the peace
Aw, and don't you forget it, as big as we're getting
This town's too small to be mean
Too small to be lying
Way too small to cheat
Way too small for secrets
Cause they're way too hard to keep
And somebody's mama knows somebody's cousin
And somebody's sister knows somebody's husband
And somebody's daughter knows somebody's brother
And around here, we all look out for each other
Yeah, somebody's mama knows somebody's cousin
And somebody's sister knows somebody's husband
And somebody's daughter knows somebody's brother
And around here, we all look out for each other
