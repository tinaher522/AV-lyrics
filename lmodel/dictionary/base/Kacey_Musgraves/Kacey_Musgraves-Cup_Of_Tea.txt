<song artist="Kacey_Musgraves" title="Cup_Of_Tea">
Maybe your jacket is a hand-me down
Maybe you slept with half of your hometown
In a world of squares maybe your just round
You can't be everybody's cup of tea
Some like it bitter, some like it sweet
Nobody's everybody's favorite, so
You might as well just make it how you please
You can't be, everybody's cup of tea
Maybe you're working at a hotel bar
Maybe you're still driving your high school car
Maybe you still don't know just who you are
You can't be everybody's cup of tea
Some like it bitter, some like it sweet
Nobody's everybody's favorite, so
You might as well just make it how you please
Maybe you married the wrong person first
Maybe your hair's way too long
Your sister's in jail
Or maybe you failed out of college
Well, hey, life goes on
We've all got the right to be wrong
You can't be everybody's cup of tea
Some like it black some like it green
Nobody's everybody's favorite
So you might as well just make it how you please
You can't be everybody's cup of tea
You can't be everybody's cup of tea
Some like it bitter, some like it sweet
Nobody's everybody's favorite, so
You might as well just make it how you please
You can't be, everybody's cup of tea
Why would you want to be?
