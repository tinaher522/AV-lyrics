<song artist="John_Lennon" title="Ya_Ya">
Well, I'm sitting in the la la
Waiting for the ya ya, uh huh
I'm sitting in the la la
Waiting for the ya ya, uh huh
It may sound funny
But I don't believe she's comin', no, no
Hey, baby, hurry
Don't make worry, no
Hey, baby, hurry
Don't make worry, uh huh huh
You know that I love you
Yes, I love you, uh huh
Well, I'm sitting in the la la
Waiting for the ya ya, uh huh
I'm sitting in the la la
Waiting for the ya ya, uh huh huh
It may sound funny
But I don't believe she's comin', no, no
Boogie down one time
Hey, baby, hurry
Don't make worry, no, no
Hey, baby, hurry
Don't make worry, no, no
You know that I love you
Always thinking of you, yeah, yeah
Hey hey hey rock
