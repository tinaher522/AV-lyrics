<song artist="John_Lennon" title="Ain't_She_Sweet">
Ain't she sweet?
Oh no, ain't she no, hang on, injection
Oh me oh mum ain't that perfection?
I repeat now!
Ain't she nice?
Well, look her over once or twice
Well, I ask you very confidentially
Ain't she nice
(Scat sing)
"Ha ha ha"
"Shall we record that, John?"
