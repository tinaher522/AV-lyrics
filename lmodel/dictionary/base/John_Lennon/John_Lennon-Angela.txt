<song artist="John_Lennon" title="Angela">
Angela, they put you in prison,
Angela, they shot down your man
Angela, you're one of the millions
Of political prisoners in the world
Sister, there's a wind that never dies
Sister, we're breathing together
Sister, our love and hopes forever keep on moving oh so slowly in the world
They gave you sunshine
They gave you sea
They gave you everything but the jailhouse key
They gave you coffee
They gave you tea
They gave you everything but equality
Angela, can you hear the earth is turning?
Angela, the world watches you
Angela, you soon will be returning to your sisters and brothers in the world
Sister, you're still a people teacher
Sister, your word reaches far
Sister, there's a million different races but we all share the same future in the world
They gave you sunshine
They gave you sea
They gave you everything but the jailhouse key
They gave you coffee
They gave you tea
They gave you everything but equality
Angela, they put you in prison
Angela, they shot down your man
Angela, you're one of the millions of political prisoners in the world
