<song artist="John_Lennon" title="Sweet_Little_Sixteen">
Whoa
They're really rockin' in Boston
In Pittsburgh, P.A.
Deep in the heart of Texas
On down the 'Frisco Bay
All over Saint Louis
And down in New Orleans
All the cats want to dance with
Sweet little sixteen
Sweet little sixteen
She's got the grown up blues
Tight dresses and lipstick
She's sportin' high heeled boots
Oh, but tomorrow morning
She's gonna have to change her trend
Become sweet sixteen
And back in class again
Oh mommy, mommy
Please, please, may I go?
You know it's such a sight to see them
Somebody steal the show
Oh, daddy, daddy, daddy, daddy
You know I beg of you
Scream it to mama
It's alright with you
Because they're rockin' in New York
In Philadelphia, P.A.
Deep in the heart of Texas
Down the Rainbow, L.A.
All over Saint Louis
And down in New Orleans
All the mothers wanna to
Be sweet little sixteen
Sweet sweet sweet sixteen
She's so delicate
She's just got to have it
About half
Half a million
