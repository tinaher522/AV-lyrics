<song artist="John_Lennon" title="Rip_It_Up_-_Ready_Teddy">
Well, it's Saturday night, and I just got paid
Fool about my money, don't try to save
My heart says: Go! Go! Have a time
'Cause it's Saturday night and baby, I'm feelin' fine
Gonna rip it up
Gonna rock it up
Gonna shake it up
Gonna ball it up
Gonna rock it up
And ball the night
Got me a date and I don't be late
Picked her up in my eighty-eight
Shag on down to the Union hall
When the joint starts jumpin', and I'll have a ball
Gonna rip it up
Gonna rock it up
Gonna shake it up
Gonna ball it up
Gonna rock it up
And ball the night
Whoa!
Well, ready, set, go, man, go
I got a girl that I love so
And I'm ready
Ready, ready, teddy
I'm ready
Ready, ready, teddy
I'm ready
Ready, ready, teddy
I'm ready, ready, teddy, to rock and roll
Goin' to the corner, pick up my sweetie pie
She's a rock and roll baby, she's the apple of my eye
I'm ready
Ready, ready, teddy
I'm ready
Ready, ready, teddy
I'm ready
Ready, ready, teddy
I'm ready, ready, teddy, to rock and roll
