"Hello!"
Doo, doo, doo-doo
Well, do you wanna dance, hold my hand?
Tell me, I'm your lovin' man?
Baby, do you wanna dance, dance, dance?
Well, do you wanna dance under the moonlight?
Hug and kiss all through the night, now?
Baby, do you wanna dance, dance, dance?
Well, do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance?
Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance?
Baby, do you wanna dance?
All right, all right
Look out
Look out
(Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance?) Do you wanna dance?
(Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance?)
(Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance?)
Well, do you wanna dance, make romance?
Kiss and squeeze, yeah, yeah?
Do you wanna dance?
All right, now, dance
Well!
Beep! Beep!
Wow!
Well, do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance?
Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance?
Baby, do you wanna dance?
