<song artist="John_Lennon" title="Instant_Karma_(We_All_Shine_On)">
Oh no, no, no, no!
Let us play, the choir comes in on time. If you know the song, join in
'cause we're all alone up here.
I'm only just beginning to understand what this record was about.
Two, three, four! 
Instant karma's gonna get you,
Gonna knock you right in the head.
You better get yourself together,
Pretty soon you're gonna be dead.
What in the world you thinking of
Laughing in the face of love?
What on earth you tryin' to do?
It's up to you, yeah, you!
Instant karma's gonna get you,
Gonna knock you right in the face.
You better get yourself together, darlin',
Join the human race.
How in the world you gonna see,
Laughing at fools like me?
Who on earth do you think you are,
A superstar? Well, all right, you are!
Well, we all shine on,
Like the moon and the stars and the sun.
Yeah, we all shine on,
On and on (and on and on) come on, yeah!
All right,
Oh!
Yeah!
Well, we all shine on,
Like the moon and the stars and the sun,
Yeah, we all shine on,
On and on and on and on.
Instant karma's gonna get you,
It's gonna knock you off your feet.
You better recognise your brother,
It's ev'ryone you meet.
Why in the world are we here?
Surely not to live in pain and fear.
And why on earth are you there?
When you're ev'rywhere, come and get your share.
Well, we all shine on,
Like the moon and the stars and the sun.
Yeah, we all shine on,
On and on and on and on.
Yeah, we all shine on,
Like the moon and the stars and the sun.
Yeah, we all shine on,
On and on and one more time!
Yeah, we all shine on,
Like the moon and the stars and the sun.
Yeah, we all shine on,
On and on and on and on, on and on and on 
Ha! Ha! We'll get it right next time!
