<song artist="John_Lennon" title="Aisumasen_(I'm_Sorry)">
When I'm down, really yin
And I don't know what I'm doing
Aisumasen, aisumasen Yoko
All I had to do was call your name
All I had to do was call your name 
And when I hurt you and cause you pain
Darlin I promise I won't do it again
Aisumasen, aisumasen Yoko
It's hard enough I know just to feel your own pain
It's hard enough I know to feel, feel your own pain 
All that I know is just what you tell me
All that I know is just what you show me 
When I'm down, real sanpaku
And I don't know what to do
Aisumasen, aisumasen Yoko san
All I had to do was call your name
Yes, all I had to do was call your name
