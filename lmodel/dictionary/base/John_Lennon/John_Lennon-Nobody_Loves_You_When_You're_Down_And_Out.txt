<song artist="John_Lennon" title="Nobody_Loves_You_When_You're_Down_And_Out">
I'll scratch your back, you scratch mine
Wonderful, wonderful
Do the other way, two, three, four
Nobody loves you when you're down and out
Nobody sees you when you're on cloud nine
Everybody's hustlin' for a buck and a dime
I'll scratch your back and you scratch mine
I've been across to the other side
I've shown you everything, I got nothing to hide
But still you ask me, do I love you, what it is, what it is
All I can tell you is it's all show biz
All I can tell you is it's all show biz
What it is, what it is, what it is, what it is
Nobody loves you when you're down and out
Nobody knows you when you're on cloud nine
Everybody's hustlin' for a buck and a dime
I'll scratch your back and you knife mine
I've been across the water now so many times
I've seen the one-eyed witch doctor leading the blind
But still you ask me, do I love you, what you say, what you say
Every time I put my finger on it, it slips away
Every time I put my finger on it, it slips away
What you say, what you say, what you say, what you say
Well, I get up in the morning
And I'm looking in the mirror to see, ooh, ooh, yeah
Then I'm lying in the darkness
And I know, I can't get to sleep, ooh, ooh, yeah
One, two, three, four
Nobody loves you when you're old and gray
Nobody needs you when you're upside down
Everybody's hollerin' 'bout their own birthday
Everybody loves you when you're six foot in the ground
