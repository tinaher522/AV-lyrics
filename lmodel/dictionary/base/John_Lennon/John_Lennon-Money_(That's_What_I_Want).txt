<song artist="John_Lennon" title="Money_(That's_What_I_Want)">
The best things in life are free
But you can keep 'em for the birds and bees
Money, that's what I want, that's what I want
Ooh babe yeah that's what I want
Money don't get everything it's true
But what it don't get baby I can't use
Money, that's what I want, that's what I want
All I need, that's what I want, yeah
Your lovin' gives me a thrill
But your lovin' don't pay my bills
Money, that's what I want, that's what I want
Oh that's what I want
(Money)
I want you baby it hurts me so
(That's what I want)
(Money)
Never let you go
(That's what I want)

Give me everything you got
(That's what I want)
(Money)

That's what I want
(Ohh)

Yeah money
(Money, that's what I want)
Gimme your money baby
