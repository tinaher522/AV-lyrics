<song artist="John_Lennon" title="Medley:_Bring_It_On_Home_To_Me-Send_Me_Some_Lovin'">
If you ever,
Change your mind
About leaving,
Leaving me behind
Oh, you better bring it to me,
Bring your sweet loving,
Bring it on home to me
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You know I laughed,
Laughed when you left
But now I know,
I only hurt myself
Oh, you better bring it to me,
Bring your sweet loving,
Bring it on home to me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, alright
Oh, you better bring it to me,
Bring your sweet loving,
Bring it on home to me,
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You know I'll always,
Be your slave
Till I'm dead,
And buried in my grave
Oh, you better bring it me,
Bring your sweet loving,
Bring it on home to me,
Yeah, yeah
Send me some loving,
Send it I pray
How can I love you,
When you're so far away
Send me your picture,
Send it my dear
So I can hold it,
And pretend you are near
Send me your kisses,
I can feel your touch
I need you, I need you so bad,
Don't you know I miss you so much
My days are so lonely,
My nights are so blue
I'm here and I'm lonely,
Just waiting for you
