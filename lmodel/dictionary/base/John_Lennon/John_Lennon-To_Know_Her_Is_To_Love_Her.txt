<song artist="John_Lennon" title="To_Know_Her_Is_To_Love_Her">
to know, know, know her
is to love, love, love her
ev'ryone said there'll come a day
when i, i walk along side of her.
Yeah! Just to know, know, know her
is to love, love, love her.
You know that i do,
you know that i do,
yeah, i do, oh, i do.
Why, why can't she see?
Oh, how, how blind can she be?
Some day she'll see
that she was meant just for me, oh yeah.
To know, know, know her
is to love, love, love her.
'Just, just to see her smile,
makes my life worth while.
Yeah, just to know, just to know her,
you know, is to love, love, love, love her.
You know that i do,
you know that i do,
yeah, i do
