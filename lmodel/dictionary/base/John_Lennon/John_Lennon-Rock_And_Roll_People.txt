<song artist="John_Lennon" title="Rock_And_Roll_People">
Two, three, four!
Yeah, we're rock 'n' roll people, born to pick the news
Yeah, we're rock 'n' roll people
I just couldn't change it if I would choose to
Don't tell me where your head is, man
I can see your shinin' shoes
Don't play the Virgin Mary
We all know you've been screwed
Rock 'n' roll people, born to be the news
Yeah, we're rock 'n' roll people
I just couldn't change it if I would choose to
My father was a mother
My mother was a son
Don't play the dog for dinner
We all been twenty-one
We're rock 'n' roll people, born to be the news
Yeah, we're rock 'n' roll people
I just couldn't change it if I would choose to
Don't ask me what the time is
Or how much space I need
Don't play the Mona Lisa
You'll know where she's been
Well, rock 'n' roll people, born to be the news
Yeah, we're rock 'n' roll people
I just couldn't change it if I would choose to
Sweet, sweet rock and roll
Sweet, sweet rock and roll
Sweet, sweet rock and roll
Sweet, sweet rock and roll
Sweet, sweet rock and roll
Rock, rock, rock and roll
Rock, rock, rock and roll
Rock, rock, rock and roll
Uh-huh-uh
Hey!
Two, three, four!
We're the rock 'n' roll people, born to pick the news
Yeah, we're rock 'n' roll people
I just couldn't change it if I would choose to
Don't ask me where your head is, man
I can see your shinin' shoes
Don't play the Virgin Mary
We all know you've been screwed
Well, rock 'n' roll people, born to pick the news
Yeah, we're rock 'n' roll people
I just couldn't change it if I would choose to
Sweet, sweet rock and roll
Sweet, sweet rock and roll
Sweet, sweet rock and roll
Sweet, sweet rock and roll
Sweet, sweet rock and roll
Sweet, sweet rock and roll
Sweet, sweet
Okay!
