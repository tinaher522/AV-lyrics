<song artist="John_Lennon" title="Slippin'_And_Slidin'">
Slippin' and a-slidin', peepin' and a-hidin'
Been told long time ago
Slippin' and a-slidin', peepin' and a-hidin'
Been told long time ago
I been told, baby, you been bold
I won't be your fool no more
Oh, big conniver, nothing but a jiver
Done got hip to your jive
Oh, big conniver, nothing but a jiver
Done got hip to your jive
Slippin' and a-slidin', peepin' and a-hidin'
Won't be your fool no more
Oh my Linda, she's a solid sender
You know you better surrender
Oh my Linda, she's a solid sender
You know you better surrender
Slippin' and a slidin', peepin' and a hidin'
Won't be your fool no more
Woo hoo
Slippin' and a-slidin', peepin' and a-hidin'
Been told long time ago
Slippin' and a-slidin', peepin' and a-hidin'
Been told long time ago
I been told, baby, you been bold
I won't be your fool no more
I won't be your fool no more, mama!
