<song artist="John_Lennon" title="Maggie_Mae">
Oh, dirty Maggie Mae
They have taken her away
And she'll never walk down Lime Street any more
Oh, the judge he guilty found her
Of robbin' the homeward bounder
That dirty, no good, robbin' Maggie Mae
'Tis the part of Liverpool
North of Liverpool
Two pounds ten a week, that was my pay
Oh, something down
Went down on number nine
T'was down in Kelly's porn shop, number nine
Oh, dirty Maggie Mae
They have taken her away
And she'll never walk down Lime Street any more
Oh, the judge he guilty found her
