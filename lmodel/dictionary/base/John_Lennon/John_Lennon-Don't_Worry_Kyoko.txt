Don't worry, don't worry, don't worry, don't worry,
Don't worry, don't worry, don't worry, don't worry,
Don't worry, don't worry, don't worry, don't worry,
Don't worry, don't worry, don't worry, don't worry,
Don't worry, don't worry, don't worry, don't worry,
Don't worry.
Don't worry.
Don't worry,
Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't,
Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, Kyoko.
Don't worry.
Don't
Don't worry, don't worry, don't worry, don't worry,
Don't worry, don't worry, don't worry, don't worry,
Don't worry.
Kyoko, don't worry.
Don't worry, don't worry, don't worry, don't worry,
Don't worry, don't worry, don't worry, don't worry,
Don't worry.
Don't, don't
