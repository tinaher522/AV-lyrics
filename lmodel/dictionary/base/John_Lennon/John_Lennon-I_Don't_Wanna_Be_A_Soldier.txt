Well, I don't want to be a soldier mama, I don't want to die
Well, I don't want to be a sailor mama, I don't want to fly
Well, I don't want to be a failure mama, I don't want to cry
Well, I don't want to be a soldier mama, I don't want to die
Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no
Well, I don't want to be a rich man mama, I don't want to cry
Well, I don't want to be a poor man mama, I don't want to fly
Well, I don't want to be a lawyer mama, I don't want to lie
Well, I don't want to be a soldier mama, I don't want to die
Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no, hey!
Well, I don't want to be a soldier mama, I don't want to die
Well, I don't want to be a thief now mama, I don't want to fly
Well, I don't want to be a churchman mama, I don't want to cry
Well, I don't want to be a soldier mama, I don't want to die
Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no, hey!
Oh well, I don't want to be a soldier mama, I don't want to die
Well, I don't want to be a sailor mama, I don't want to fly
Well, I don't want to be a failure mama, I don't want to cry
Well, I don't want to be a soldier mama, I don't want to die
Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no
