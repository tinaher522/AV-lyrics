<song artist="John_Lennon" title="Send_Me_Some_Lovin'">
Send me some lovin', 
Send it I pray.
How can I love you 
When you're so far away?
Send me your picture, 
Send it, my dear.
So I can hold it 
And pretend you are here.
Send me your kisses,
I can feel your touch.
I need you, I need you so badly,
Don't you know I miss you so much?
My days are so lonely, 
My nights are so blue.
I'm here and I'm lonely, 
Just waitin' for you
