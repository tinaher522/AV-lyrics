<song artist="John_Lennon" title="Mount_Elga">
Mount Elga, Mount Elga
A high mountain
I climb as I'm dreaming, a-huh
Mount Elga, Mount Elga
A high mountain
I climb as I'm dreaming
Catching me hell
To climb this hill
The more I try to climb
I'm slipping still
Me body run down
Me feeling weak
The more I try to climb up
This mountain peak
