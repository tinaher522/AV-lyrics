<song artist="John_Lennon" title="It's_So_Hard_(Live)">
You got to live
You got to love you got to be
Somebody you got to shove
But it's so hard, it's really hard
Sometimes i feel like going
Down
You got to eat
You got to drink
You got to worry
It's so hard, it's really hard
Sometimes i feel like going
Down
But when it's good it's oh so
Good
And when i hold you in
Arms baby
Sometimes i feel like going
Down
You got to run
You got to hide
You got to keep your woman
Satisfied
But it's so hard, it's really hard
Sometimes i feel like going
Down
