<song artist="John_Lennon" title="Satire_1">
Lord, take this makeup of off of me
I said, "Lordy, lordy, lordy, take this makeup offa me"
It's bad enough on the beach
But it's worse in the sea
Because I'm knockin' on heaven's door
Because I'm lookin' for my ma
I said, "Ma, take these guns away from me"
I said, "Ma, take these guns away from me"
I got so thin now, they're draggin' me down to my knees
Oh yeah, man, do you Mr. Jones?
Town
Now I've been here so long, I almost forgot my name
I said, "Lord I been here so long I almost forgot my name"
But as long as I keep touring
I'll always be in the game, fame, brain, shame and fame and game, fame, fame
