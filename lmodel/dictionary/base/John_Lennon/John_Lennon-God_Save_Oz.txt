Okay, it goes to D and then A7 at the end now. So just remember, the street, feat, sea, Queen, okay? Shall we go then? One, okay, you're ready? One, two, three, four
Oh, God save us one and all
Oh, God save us from defeat
Oh, God save us from the war
Oh, God save us on the street
Yeah, let's fight for people's rights
Let us fight for freedom
Let us fight for Mickey Mouse
Let us fight for freedom
Oh, God save us one and all
Oh, God save us from defeat
Oh, God save us from the war
Oh, God save us on the street
Let us fight for children's right
Let us fight for freedom
Let us fight for Rupert Bear
Let us fight for freedom
Oh, God save us one and all
Oh, God save us from defeat
Oh, God save us from the war
Oh, God save us from the street
Oh, God save us from defeat
Oh, God save us from the sea
Oh, God save us from the Queen
Hey, that sounded alright!
