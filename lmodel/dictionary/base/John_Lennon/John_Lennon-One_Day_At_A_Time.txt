<song artist="John_Lennon" title="One_Day_At_A_Time">
You are my weakness
You are my strength
Nothing I have in the world
Makes better sense
'Cause I'm a fish and you're the sea
When we're together
When we're apart
There's never a beat in between
The beat of our hearts
'Cause I'm the apple and you're the tree
(Toot-toot-toot)
One day at a time is all we do-be doo
One day at a time is good for
You
Oh
Oh
Oh-oh
You are my woman
I am your man
Nothing else matters at all
Now I understand
That I'm the door and you're the key
And ev'ry morning
I wake in your smile
Feeling your breath on my face
And the love in your eyes
'Cause you're the honey and I'm the bee
(Toot-toot-toot)
One day at a time is all we do-be-doo-be-doo
One day at a time is good for
You
Us two
You too
Oh-oh
Do do do do
Do do do do
Do do do do do do
Do do do do
'Cause I'm the fish and you're the sea
'Cause I'm the apple and you're the tree
'Cause I'm the door and you're the key
'Cause I'm a honey and you're the bee
