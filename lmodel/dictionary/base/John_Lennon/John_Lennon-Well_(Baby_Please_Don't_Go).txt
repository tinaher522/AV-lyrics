<song artist="John_Lennon" title="Well_(Baby_Please_Don't_Go)">
Two, three, four
You know I love you, baby, please don't go, well, well
Know I love you, baby, please don't go, well, well
You know I love you, honey child
There's nothing that I wouldn't do for you right now
You know I love you, baby, please don't go, well
Know I need you, baby, please don't go
You know I love you, baby, please don't go, well
You know I love you, honey child
Nothing that I wouldn't do for you right now
Know I love you, baby, please don't go, well
You know I want you, baby, please don't go, well, well
Know I want you, baby, please don't go
You know I love you, honey child
There's nothing that I wouldn't do for you right now
You know I want, baby, please don't go, well
You know I love you, baby, please don't go, well
You know I love you, baby, please don't go
You know I love you, honey child
Nothing that I wouldn't do for you right now
I know I love you, baby, please don't go, well, hey
