<song artist="John_Lennon" title="Steppin'_Out">
This here's the story about a house husband
Who, you know, just has to get out of the house
He's been looking at the, you know, the kids for days and days
He's been washing the dishes and screwing around and watching Sesame Street
'Til he's gone crazy
Woke up this morning, blues around my head
No need to ask the reason why
Went to the kitchen and lit a cigarette
Blew my worries to the sky
I'm steppin' out
I'm steppin' out
I'm steppin' out
I'm steppin' out, yeah
If it don't feel right, you don't have to do it
Just leave a message on the phone and tell them to screw it
After all is said and done you can't go pleasin' everyone
So screw it
I'm steppin' out
I'm steppin' out
I'm steppin' out, baby
I'm steppin' out
Baby's sleeping, the cats have all been blessed
Ain't nothing doing on TV, summer repeats
Put on my space suit, I got to look my best
I'm going out to do the city
I'm steppin' out
I'm steppin' out
I'm steppin' out, babe
I'm steppin' out
Boogie
One more
I'm steppin' out
Hold it down
I'm steppin' out
I'm steppin' out
Gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta get out
I'm steppin' out, babe
Just awhile
Ain't been out for days
Got to do it tonight
Gimme a break, gimme a break
Gotta get out
Gotta get out
Just for awhile, just for the night
I'll be in before one or two
