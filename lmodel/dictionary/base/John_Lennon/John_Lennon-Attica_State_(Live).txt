<song artist="John_Lennon" title="Attica_State_(Live)">
What a waste of human
Power
What a waste of human lives,
Shoot the prisioners in
The towers
Forthy-three poor widowed
Wives
Media blames it on the
Prisioners,
But the prisioners did not kill
"Rockefeller pulled the trigger"
That's what the people feel.
Attica, Attica state, we're all
Mates with Attica state.
Free the prisioners, free
The judges
Free all the prisioners everywhere,
All they want is truth
And justice
All they need is love and care
They all live in suffocation,
Let's not wathc them die
In sorrow,
Now's the time for revolution,
Give them all chance to grow.
Attica state......
Come together join the movement,
Take a stand for human rights,
Fear and hatred clouds
Our judgement,
Free us all from endless
Night,
Attica state....
We are all mattes...
We all live in......
Attica, Attica, Attica state.
