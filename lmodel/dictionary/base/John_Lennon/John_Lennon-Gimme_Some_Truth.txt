<song artist="John_Lennon" title="Gimme_Some_Truth">
I'm sick and tired of hearing things
From uptight, short-sighted, narrow-minded hypocritics
All I want is the truth
Just gimme some truth
I've had enough of reading things
By neurotic, psychotic, pig-headed politicians
All I want is the truth
Just gimme some truth
No short-haired, yellow-bellied, son of Tricky Dick
Is gonna Mother Hubbard soft soap me
For just a pocketful of hope
Money for dope
Money for rope
Woo hoo
No short-haired, yellow-bellied, son of Tricky Dick
Is gonna Mother Hubbard soft soap me
With just a pocketful of soap
Money for dope
Money for rope
I'm sick to death of seeing things
From tight-lipped, condescending, mama's little chauvinists
All I want is the truth,
Just gimme some truth, now
I've had enough of watching scenes
With schizophrenic, ego-centric, paranoiac prima-donnas
All I want is the truth now, now
Just gimme some truth
No short-haired, yellow-bellied, son of Tricky Dick
Is gonna Mother Hubbard soft soap me
With just a pocketful of soap
It's money for dope
Money for rope
Ah, I'm sick to death of peering things
From uptight, short-sighted, narrow-minded hypocrites
All I want is the truth, now
Just gimme some truth, now
I've had enough of reading things
By neurotic, psychotic, pig-headed politicians
All I want is the truth, now
Just gimme some truth, now
All I want is the truth, now
Just gimme some truth, now
All I want is the truth
Just gimme some truth
All I want is the truth
Just gimme some truth
