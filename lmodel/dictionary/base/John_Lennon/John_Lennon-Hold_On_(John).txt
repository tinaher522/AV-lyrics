<song artist="John_Lennon" title="Hold_On_(John)">
Hold on John, John hold on
It's gonna be alright
You gonna win the fight
Hold on Yoko, Yoko hold on
It's gonna be alright
You gonna make the flight
When you're by yourself and there's no-one else
You just have yourself and you tell yourself
Just to hold on
Hold on world, world hold on
It's gonna be alright
You gonna see the light
Oh, hen you're one, really one
Well you get things done like they never been done
So hold on
