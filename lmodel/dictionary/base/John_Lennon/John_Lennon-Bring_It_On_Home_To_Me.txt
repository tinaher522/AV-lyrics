<song artist="John_Lennon" title="Bring_It_On_Home_To_Me">
If you ever change your mind,
About leaving, leaving me behind,
Oh, you'd better bring it to me,
Bring your sweet lovin',
Bring it on home to me.
Yeh, (yeh) yeh, (yeh) yeh.
You know I laughed,
Laughed when you left.
But now I know, i've only hurt myself.
Oh, you'd better bring it to me,
Bring your sweet lovin',
Bring it on home to me.
Yeh, (yeh) yeh, (yeh) yeh, yeh, yeh.
Oh, you'd better bring it to me,
Bring your sweet lovin',
Bring it on home to me.
Yeh, (yeh) yeh, (yeh) yeh.
You know i'll always be your slave,
Until I'm dead and buried in my grave.
Oh, you'd better bring it to me,
Bring your sweet lovin',
Bring it on home to me.
Yeh, (yeh) yeh, yeh
