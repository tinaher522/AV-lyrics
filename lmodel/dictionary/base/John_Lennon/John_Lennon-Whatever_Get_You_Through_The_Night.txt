<song artist="John_Lennon" title="Whatever_Get_You_Through_The_Night">
One, two, three, four
Alright, alright
Whatever gets you through the night
It's alright, alright
It's your money or your life
It's alright, alright
Don't need a sword to cut through flowers
Oh no, oh no
Whatever gets you through your life
It's alright, alright
Doin' wrong, doin' wrong, do it right
It's alright, alright
Don't need a watch to waste your time
Oh no, oh no
Listen, listen
Hold me, darlin', come on, listen to me
I won't do you no harm
Trust me, darlin', come on, listen to me
Come on, listen to me, listen, listen, listen
Alright
Whatever gets you to the light
It's alright, it's alright
Out the blue or out of sight
It's alright, alright
Don't need a gun to blow your mind
Oh no, no no, no no
Listen
Hold me, darlin', come on, listen to me
I won't do you no harm
Trust me, darlin', come on, listen to me
Come on, listen to me, listen to me, listen to me
Alright
Do it right, do it right, do it right, do it right
Doin' it right, doin' it right
Stop
[Incomprehensible]
