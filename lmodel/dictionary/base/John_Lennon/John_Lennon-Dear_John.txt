<song artist="John_Lennon" title="Dear_John">
Dear John
Don't be hard on yourself
Give yourself a break
Life wasn't meant to be run
The race is over, you've won
Dear John
Don't be hard on yourself
Give yourself a break
Life wasn't meant to be run
The race is over, you've won
Ha da doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
(Laugh)
Dear John
Don't be hard on yourself
Give yourself a break
Life wasn't meant to be run
The race is over
(Whistle)
And dear John
Put the TV on, have a snack
Wash your mother's back
The race is over
