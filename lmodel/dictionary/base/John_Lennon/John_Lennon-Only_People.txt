<song artist="John_Lennon" title="Only_People">
Only people know just how to talk to people
Only people know just how to change the world
Only people realize the power of people
Well, a million heads are better than one
So come on, get it on! 
Well I know how we tried and the millions of tears that we cried
Now we are hipper we been thru the trip
And we can't be denied with woman and man side by side
Make no mistake it's our future we're making
Bake the cake and eat it too!
We don't want no pig brother scene! 
Only people know just how to talk to people
Only people know just how to change the world
Only people realize the power of people
Well, a million heads are better than one
So come on, get it on! 
We'll it's long overdue there ain't nothing better to do
Now we are hipper we been thru the trip
We can fly right on thru, there's nothing on earth we can't do
Fish or cut bait it's our future we're making
All together now pull the chain
We don't want no pig brother scene! 
Only people know just how to talk to people
Only people know just how to change the world
(repeat three more times)
