<song artist="John_Lennon" title="Goodnight_Vienna">
..last night, ah-hah-hah
She was so beautiful, she made me uptight, ah-hah-hah
-oh gee! I'm worn out! Can we try another, can you hear what he's saying?
I took my baby to a party last night, ah-hah-hah
She was so beautiful, she made me uptight, ah-hah-hah
Up come a butcher with her ju jus alight, ah-hah-hah
It's all da-da-da-down to goodnight Vienna
Felt like a bohunk but I kept up my cool, ah-hah-hah
Green as a frog, man, I was back into school, ah-hah-hah
Zipped up my mouth 'cause I was starting to drool, ah-hah-hah
It's all da-da-da-down to goodnight Vienna
Git it up!
Git it up!
Git it up!
Git it up!
It's all da-da-da-down to goodnight Vienna
She said she loved me but I knew she was lying, ah-hah-hah
Felt like an Arab who was dancing through Zion, ah-hah-hah
Don't call no doctor when you just feel like crying, ah-hah-hah
It's all da-da-da-down to goodnight Vienna
Uhuh-
Git it up!
Git it up!
Git it up!
Git it up!
I took my baby to a party last night, ah-hah-hah
She was so beautiful, it made me uptight, ah-hah-hah
Up came a doct-- oh...
(various cheering and applause)
