<song artist="John_Lennon" title="Blue_Suede_Shoes">
Well, it's a one for the money, two for the show,
Three to get ready, now go, cat, go!
Don't you step on my blue suede shoes.
Well, you can do anything
But lay off them blue suede shoes.
Well, you can knock me down, step in my face,
Slander my name all over the place;
Do anything that you wanna do,
But, aw-aw, honey, lay off them shoes.
Don't you step on my blue suede shoes.
Well, you can do anything
But lay off them blue suede shoes.
Well, you can burn my house, steal my car,
Drink my liquor from the old fruit jar.
Do anything that you wanna do,
But, aw-aw, honey, lay off them shoes.
Don't you step on my blue suede shoes.
Well, you can do anything
But lay off them blue suede shoes.
Well, hey!
Well, it's blue, blue, blue suede shoes,
Hey, blue, blue, blue suede shoes,
Hey, blue, blue, blue suede shoes,
Hey, blue, blue, blue suede shoes.
Well, you can do anything
But lay off my blue suede shoes
