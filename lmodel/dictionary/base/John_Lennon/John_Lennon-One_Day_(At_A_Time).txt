<song artist="John_Lennon" title="One_Day_(At_A_Time)">
You are my weakness
You are my strength
Nothing I have in the world
Makes better sense
Cause I'm the fish and you're the sea.
When we're together
Or when we're apart
There's never a space in between
The beat of our hearts
Cause I'm the apple and you're the tree.
One day a time is all we do
One day at a time is good for you
(yeah) you (yeah) you (yeah) you.
You are my woman
I am your man
Nothing else matters at all,
Now I understand
That I'm the door and you're the key.
And every morning
I wake in your smile
Feeling your breath on my face
And in the love in your eyes
Cause you're the honey and I'm the bee.
One day at a time is all we do
One day at a time is good for us two 
(yeah) us two (yeah) us two (yeah) you.
