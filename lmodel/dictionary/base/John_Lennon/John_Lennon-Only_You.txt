<song artist="John_Lennon" title="Only_You">
Only you can make this world seem right
Only you can make the darkness bright
Only you and you alone can thrill me like you do
And fill my heart with love for only you
Only you can make this change in me
For it's true, you are my destiny
When you hold my hand, I understand the magic that you do
You're my dream come true
My one and only you, only you
Only you and you alone can thrill me like you do
And fill my heart with love for only you
Only you can make this change in me
For it's true, you are my destiny
When you hold my hand, I understand the magic that you do do
You're my dream come true
My one, my one, my one and only you
Only you, only you, only you
Only you, only you, only you
Only you, only you, only you
