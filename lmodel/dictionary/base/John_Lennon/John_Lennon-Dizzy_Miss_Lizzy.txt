<song artist="John_Lennon" title="Dizzy_Miss_Lizzy">
You make me dizzy, Miss Lizzy, 
The way you rock'n'roll. 
You make me dizzy, Miss Lizzy, 
When we do the stroll. 
Come on, Miss Lizzy, 
Love me fore I grow too old. 
Come on, give me fever, 
Put your little hand in mine. 
You make me dizzy, Miss Lizzy, 
Girl, you look so fine. 
You're just a-rockin' and a-rollin', 
I sure do wish you were mine. 
You make me dizzy, Miss Lizzy, 
When you call my name. 
O-o-o-o-oh baby, 
Say you're driving me insane. 
Come on, come on, come on, baby, 
I want to be your lover man. 
Run and tell your mama 
I want you to be my bride. 
Run and tell your brother, 
Baby, don't run and hide. 
You make me dizzy, Miss Lizzy, 
And I want to marry you. 
Come on, give me fever, 
Put your little hand in mine. 
You make me dizzy, Miss Lizzy, 
Girl, you look so fine. 
You're just a-rockin' and.a-rollin', 
I sure do wish you were mine
