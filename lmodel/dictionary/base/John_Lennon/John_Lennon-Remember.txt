<song artist="John_Lennon" title="Remember">
Remember when you were young?
How the hero was never hung
Always got away
Remember how the man
Used to leave you empty handed?
Always, always let you down
If you ever change your mind
About leaving it all behind
Remember, remember, today 
And don't feel sorry
The way it's gone
And don't you worry
'Bout what you've done 
Just remember when you were small
How people seemed so tall
Always had their way
Do you remember your Ma and Pa
Just wishing for movie stardom
Always, always playing a part
If you ever feel so sad
And the whole world is driving you mad
Remember, remember, today 
And don't feel sorry
'Bout the way it's gone
And don't you worry
'Bout what you've done 
No, no, remember, remember
The fifth of November
