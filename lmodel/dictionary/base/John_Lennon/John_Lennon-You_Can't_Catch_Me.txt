<song artist="John_Lennon" title="You_Can't_Catch_Me">
I bought a brand new airmobile
'Twas a custom made, 'twas a flightning deal
With a powerful motor and a hide away wing
Push in on the button, you will hear her sing
Now, you can't catch me
Baby, you can't catch me
'Cause if you get too close
You know I'm goin' like cool breeze
Hey, hey
Well, you walk
You walk
New Jersey turnpike in the wee wee hours
I was rollin' slowly 'cause of drizzlin' showers
Here come a flat-top, he was movin' up with me
Then come waving goodbye in a souped up jitney
I put my foot in the tank, I began to roll
Moanin' siren, 'twas the state patrol
I let out my wings, then I blew my horn
Bye-bye, New Jersey, I become airborn
You can't catch me
Baby, you can't catch me
'Cause if you get too close
You know I'm goin' like cool breeze
Hey
Well, you walk
Yeah, walk
I bought a brand new airmobile
'Twas a custom made, 'twas a flightning deal
With a powerful motor and a hide away wing
Push in on the button, you will hear her sing
Now, you can't catch me
Baby, you can't catch me
'Cause if you get too close
You know I'm goin' like cool breeze
Hey, hey
Well, you walk
You walk
Flying with my baby last Saturday night
Wasn't a grey cloud floatin' in sight
Big, full moon, shinin' up above
Cuddle up, honey, be my love
Sweetest little thing that I ever seen
I'm gonna name you Maybellene
Flying on the beam, set on flight control
Radio tuned to rock and roll
Two, three hours passed us by
Altitude dropped into five-oh-five
Fuel consumption, way too fast
Let's get on home before we run out of gas
Now, you can't catch me
Baby, you can't catch me
'Cause if you get too close
You know I'm goin' like cool breeze
Git it on
Yeah, walk
Git it on
Git it on, git it on, do it
Git it on, git it on
You know you can't catch me
