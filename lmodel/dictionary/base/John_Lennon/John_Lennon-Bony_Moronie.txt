Yeah
Ooh
I got a girl named Bony Moronie
She's as skinny as a stick of macaroni
Got to see her rock 'n' roll with her blue jeans on
She's not very fat, just skin and bone
Well now, I love her, and she loves me
Oh how happy now we gonna be
Makin' love underneath the apple tree
Well, I told her mama and her papa too
Just exactly what I'm gonna do
We're gonna get married on a night in June
Rock and roll by the light of the silvery moon
Wow, yeah
Well now, I love her, and she loves me
Oh how happy now we gonna be
Makin' love underneath the apple tree
Makin' love, baby
Well, she's my one and only, she's my heart's desire
She's a real upsetter, she's a real live wire
Everybody's watchin' when my baby walks by
She's so good lookin', really catches the eye
Well now, I love her, she loves me
Oh how happy now we gonna be
Makin' love underneath the apple tree
Yeah yeah
Makin' love
Makin' love
Makin' love
Harder
