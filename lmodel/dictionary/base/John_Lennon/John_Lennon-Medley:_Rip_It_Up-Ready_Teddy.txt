<song artist="John_Lennon" title="Medley:_Rip_It_Up-Ready_Teddy">
Well it's Saturday night, and I just got paid
Fool about my money, don't try to save
My heart says "go! go! have a time"
'Cause it's Saturday night, baby, I'm feelin' fine
Gonna rip it up,
Gonna rock it up,
Gonna shake it up,
Gonna ball it up,
Gonna rock it up,
And ball the night.
Got me a date and I won't be late,
Picked her up in my eighty-eight.
Shag on down to the union hall,
When the joint starts jumpin', I 'll have a ball.
Gonna rip it up,
Gonna rock it up,
Gonna shake it up,
Gonna ball it up,
Gonna rock it up,
And ball the night.
Whoa!
Well, ready, set, go man, go,
I got a girl that I love so.
And I'm ready,
Ready, ready, teddy,
I'm ready,
Ready, ready, teddy,
I'm ready,
Ready, ready, teddy,
I'm ready, ready, teddy to rock and roll.
Goin' to the corner, pick up my sweetie pie,
She's a rock and roll baby, she's the apple of my eye.
I'm ready,
Ready, ready, teddy,
I'm ready,
Ready, ready, teddy,
I'm ready,
Ready, ready, teddy,
I'm ready, ready, teddy to rock and roll.
