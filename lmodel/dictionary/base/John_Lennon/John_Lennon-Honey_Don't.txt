<song artist="John_Lennon" title="Honey_Don't">
Well how can you say you will when you won't,
Say you do, baby, when you don't?
Let me know, honey, how you feel
Tell the truth how is love real.
But oh well honey don't, well honey don't,
Honey don't, honey don't, honey don't
I say you will when you won't, oh honey, don't.
Well I love you, baby, and you ought to know
I like the way you wear your clothes,
If it's in a batch you were so doggone sweet,
You got that sand all over your feet.
Well sometimes I love you on a Saturday night,
Sunday morning you don't look right.
You've been out painting the town,
Uh baby, been stepping around
