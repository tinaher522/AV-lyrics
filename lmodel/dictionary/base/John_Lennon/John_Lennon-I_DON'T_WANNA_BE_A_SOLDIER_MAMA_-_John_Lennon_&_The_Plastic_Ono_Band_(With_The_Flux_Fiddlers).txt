Well, i don't wanna be a
Soldier mama, i don't wanna
Die
Well, i don't wanna be a
Sailor mama, i don't wanna
Fly
Well, i don't wanna be a
Failure mama, i don't wanna
Cry
Well, i don't wanna be a
Soldier mama, i don't wanna
Die
Oh no oh no oh no oh no
Well, i don't wanna be a
Rich man mama, i don't wanna
Cry
Well, i don't wanna be a
Poor man mama, i don't wanna
Fly
Well, i don't wanna be a
Lawyer mama, i don't wanna
Lie
Well, i don't wanna be a
Soldier mama, i don't wanna
Die
Oh no oh no oh no oh no oh no
Oh no
Well, i don't wanna be a
Beggar mama, i don't wanna
Die
Well, i don't wanna be a
Thief now mama, i don't wanna
Fly
Well, i don't wanna be a
Churchman mama, i don't wanna
Cry
Well, i don't wanna be a
Soldier mama, i don't wanna
Die
Oh no oh no oh no oh no
