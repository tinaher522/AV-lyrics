-"Okay, okay, shall we try another one? It's the intro that we're worst on now, a bit slow isn't it?"
-"Yeah"
-"Yeah, too ...?... on the tom toms or something, about four, okay, shall we try it? Okay boys, this is it! Hey, hey one, two, three, four"
When I was a little boy
Way back home in Liverpool
My mama told me, I was great
Then when I was a teenager
I knew that I had got something going
My baby told me I was great
Now I'm a man
A woman took me by the hand
And she told me I was great
I was in the greatest show on earth
For what it was worth
And now I'm thirty-two
And all I wanna do, is boogaloo!
Hey!
Yeah, I look at myself in the mirror
I see my wife and kids
And they tell me you're great
Now let me introduce to you
The one and only Billy Shears
Ah, she's thirty-two
And all she wants to do, is boogaloo!
Hey!
Hey, hey, hey, hear them say
My mama told me I was great
Ho! Ho! Ho!
-"Let's go again, go straight from thee top
Okay, oh, that's okay... bang... two, three, four!"
