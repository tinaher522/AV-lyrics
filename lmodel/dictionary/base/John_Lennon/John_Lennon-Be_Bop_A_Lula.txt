<song artist="John_Lennon" title="Be_Bop_A_Lula">
Well, be-bop-a-lula, she's my baby
Be-bop-a-lula, I don't mean maybe
Be-bop-a-lula, she's my baby
Be-bop-a-lula, I don't mean maybe
Be-bop-a-lula, she's my baby doll, my baby doll, my baby doll
Well, she's the gal in the red blue jeans
She's the queen of all the teens
She's the woman that I know
She's the woman that loves me so, say
Be-bop-a-lula, she's my baby
Be-bop-a-lula, I don't mean maybe
Be Bop A Lula, she's my baby doll, my baby doll, my baby doll (Let's rock)
Well, she's the woman who's got that beat
She's the woman with the flyin' feet
She's the woman walks around the store
She's the woman that yells come on, more, more, more
Be-bop-a-lula, she's my baby 
Be-bop-a-lula, I don't mean maybe
Be-bop-a-lula, she's my baby doll, my baby doll, my baby doll (Let's rock again)
Well, be-bop-a-lula, she's my baby 
Be-bop-a-lula, I don't mean maybe
Be-bop-a-lula, she's my baby 
Be-bop-a-lula, I don't mean maybe
Be-bop-a-lula, she's my baby doll, my baby doll, my baby doll
