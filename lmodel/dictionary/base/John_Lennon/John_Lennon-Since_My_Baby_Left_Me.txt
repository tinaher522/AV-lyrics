Okay! Okay! This is it, children!
Hey, hey, hey, hey - hey!
That's nice!
The story 'bout all of us
Not one missing
She leaves you
Ain't got no sweet, no, no, no
Yeah!
Since my baby left me (Since my baby left me)
Never said a word (Never said a word)
Was it something I done (Was it something I done)
Something that she heard? (Something that she heard?)
You know, she left me (Yes, she left me)
Yes, she left me (Yes, she left me)
My baby even left me, never said a word
Tra la la (Tra la la)
Tra la la (Tra la la)
Now I stand at my window (Now I stand at my window)
Wring my hand and cry (Wring my hand and cry)
I hate to lose that woman (I hate to lose that woman)
Hate to say goodbye (Hate to say goodbye)
You know, she left me (Yes, she left me)
Yes, she left me (Yes, she left me)
My baby even left me, never said goodbye
Never said goodbye!
Da da da (Da da da)
Da da da (Da da da)
Da da da (Da da da)
Da da da (Da da da)
One of these mornings (One of these mornings)
Lord, it won't be long (Lord, it won't belong)
You look for me and, baby (You look for me, baby)
And daddy will be gone (Daddy will be gone)
You know, she left me (Yes, she left me)
Yes, she left me (Yes, she left me)
My baby even left me, never said a word
Not a word!
Da da da (Da da da)
Da da da (Da da da)
Da da da (Da da da)
Da da da (Da da da)
Oh, so sad
So sad
So, so sad
So, so, so sad
