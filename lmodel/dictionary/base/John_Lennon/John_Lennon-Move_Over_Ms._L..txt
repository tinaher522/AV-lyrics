<song artist="John_Lennon" title="Move_Over_Ms._L.">
One, two, a one, two, three, four
Well, now the underground and overjoyed, they come on just the same
Don't wanna get too real, man, they just wanna play the game
I guess ya knew it all along, we were just singing in the rain
Can't get hipped to the down trip, the ship is sailing yet
And if it sinks, you know that all we really get is wet
Move over Ms. L.
You know I wish you well
Move over Ms. L.
You know I wish you well
Move over Ms. L.
Well, now to err is something human and forgiving so divine
I'll forgive your trespasses if you forgive me mine
Life's a deal, you knew it, when you signed the dotted line
They nail you to the paper, put a rope around your neck
And so we sing along, the boy stood on the burning deck
Move over Ms. L.
You know I wish you well
Move over Ms. L.
You know I wish you well
Move over Ms. L.
Well now, momma poppa told me, "Son, you better watch your head"
Your head is fulla snakes, boy, you're better red than dead
They're starving back in China, boy, that's what they always said
Can't get head in the head shop, yer jeans are fulla crap
You're full of beans, you're in your teens, you lost your momma's road map
Move over Ms. L.
You know I wish you well
Move over Ms. L.
You know I wish you well
Move over Ms. L.
Hey hey
