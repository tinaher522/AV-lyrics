<song artist="John_Lennon" title="Imagine_+_Photo_Gallery">
Imagine there's no heaven
It's easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us only sky
Imagine all the people living for today
Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
No religion too
Imagine all the people living life in peace
You may say
I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only one
I hope some day you'll join us
And the world will live as one
Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man
Imagine all the people sharing all the world
You may say
That I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only one
I hope some day you'll join us
And the world will be as one
