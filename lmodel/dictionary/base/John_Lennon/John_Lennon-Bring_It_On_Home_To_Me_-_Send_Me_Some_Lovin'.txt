<song artist="John_Lennon" title="Bring_It_On_Home_To_Me_-_Send_Me_Some_Lovin'">
If you ever change your mind
About leavin', leavin' me behind
Oh, you'd better bring it to me
Bring your sweet lovin'
Bring it on home to me
Yeah (yeah) yeah (yeah) yeah
You know I laughed, laughed when you left
But now I know, I only hurt myself
Oh, you'd better bring it to me
Bring your sweet lovin'
Bring it on home to me
Yeah (yeah) yeah (yeah) yeah yeah yeah
Oh, you'd better bring it to me
Bring your sweet lovin'
Bring it on home to me
Yeah (yeah) yeah (yeah) yeah
You know I'll always be your slave
Until I'm dead and buried in my grave
Oh, you'd better bring it to me
Bring your sweet lovin'
Bring it on home to me
Yeah (yeah) yeah yeah
Send me some lovin'
Send it, I pray
How can I love you
When you're so far away?
Send me your picture
Send it, my dear
So I can hold it
And pretend you are here
Send me your kisses
I can feel your touch
I need you, I need you so badly
Don't you know I miss you so much?
My days are so lonely
My nights are so blue
I'm here and I'm lonely
Just waitin' for you
