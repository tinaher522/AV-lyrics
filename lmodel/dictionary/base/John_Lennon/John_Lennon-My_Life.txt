<song artist="John_Lennon" title="My_Life">
- "Okay, but we like to, we like to have those things on record"
- "Yeah, right"
- "Let's not get so hysterical this time"
- "No"
My life, take it, it's mine to give
Take it, let me live in you
My life, take it, it's yours
Do what you will, I dedicate it to you
What's the use in waking
If you're not there to share the dreams and nightmares?
My life, take it, for better or worse
Why waste time?
We both know together is the only way
We'll make it any way
Take it, my life
My life is you
What's the use in waking
If you're not there to share the dreams and nightmares?
I've only myself to
I've only myself to (Give to) you
My life, take it, for better or worse
Why waste time?
When we both know together is the only way
We're gonna make it any way
Take it, my life
My life is you
