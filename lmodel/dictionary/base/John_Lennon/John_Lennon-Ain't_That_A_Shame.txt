<song artist="John_Lennon" title="Ain't_That_A_Shame">
You made me cry
When you said goodbye
Ain't that a shame?
My tears fell like rain
Ain't that a shame?
You're the one to blame
You broke my heart
When you said we'd part
Ain't that a shame?
My tears fell like rain
Ain't that a shame?
You're the one to blame
Boogie, babe!
Ain't that a shame?
Ain't that a shame?
Look out!
Farewell, goodbye
Although I'll cry
Ain't that a shame?
My tears fell like rain
Ain't that a shame?
You're the one to blame
Boogie, babe!
Ain't that a shame?
Ain't that a shame?
You made me cry
When you said goodbye
Ain't that a shame?
My tears fell like rain
Ain't that a shame?
You're the one to blame
