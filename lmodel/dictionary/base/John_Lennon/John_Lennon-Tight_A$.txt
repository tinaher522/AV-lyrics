<song artist="John_Lennon" title="Tight_A$">
Just as tight a$ you can make it
Hard and slow ain't hard enough
Just tight a$ you can shake it, girl
Get it on and do your stuff
Tight a$ you can get it
Tight a$ got it made
Uptight's alright but if ya can't stand the heat
You better get back in the shade
Just tight a$ an Indian rope trick
Long and tough ain't hard enough
Just as tight a$ a dope fiend's fix my friend
Get it up and do your stuff
Tight a$ you can boogie
Tight a$ got it made
Uptight alright's alright but if ya can't stand the heat
You better get back in the shade
Well tight a$ got me concerned
Tight a$ got me laid
Tight a$ strut your stuff so tough
Just sweating in the midnight shade...
