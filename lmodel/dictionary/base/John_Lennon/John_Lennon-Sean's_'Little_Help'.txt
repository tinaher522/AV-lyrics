<song artist="John_Lennon" title="Sean's_'Little_Help'">
Do you need anybody?
I need somebody to love
Do you need anybody?
I need somebody to love
- "Good"
- "That's my favourite song"
- "Very good"
- "Who was singing "I need somebody to love", you?
- "It was Ringo but Paul and I was singing with him"
- "What's this song called?"
- "What's it called? I've forgotten what it's called"
What would you think if I sang out a song
- "It's "sang out of tune"
- "Oh, "A Little Help From My Friends", that's what it's called!"
