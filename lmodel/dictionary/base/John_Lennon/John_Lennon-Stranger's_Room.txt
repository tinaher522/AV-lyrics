<song artist="John_Lennon" title="Stranger's_Room">
- "At this time... I just like to sing."
Here in this lonely room
Late in the afternoon
Dreaming my life away-hey
Don't answer the telephone
I'm not home receiving you
Here in the afternoon
Alone in some stranger's room
What am I doing here at all?
No need to over do it
I'm bleeding now
I'm bleeding now
Stop the bleeding now
Stop the bleeding now
Oozing out
Dripping down
Table's silent shout
Aghhh!
(Scat sing and whistle)
Stop the bleeding now
