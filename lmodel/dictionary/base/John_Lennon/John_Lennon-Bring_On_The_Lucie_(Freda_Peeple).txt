(Alright Boys, this is it, over the hill) 
One, two, three, four...
We don't care what flag you're waving,
We don't even wanna know your name,
We don't care where you're from or where you're going,
All we know is that you came.
You're making all our decisions,
We have just one request of you - 
That while you're thinking things over,
It's something you just better do:
Free the people now,
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it now
Well, we were caught with our hands in the air
Don't despair paranoia is everywhere
We can shake it with love when we're scared
So let's shout it aloud like a prayer. 
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it now
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it now 
We don't care what rules you're playing,
We don't even want to play your game,
You think you're cool and know what you are doing,
and 666 is your name.
So while you're jerking off each other,
You bear this thought in mind,
Your time is come - you better know it,
But maybe you just can't read the sign.
Free the people now
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it now
Well you were caught with your hands in the kill
And you still got to swallow your pill
As you slip and you slide down the hill
On the blood of the people you killed 
Stop the killing now
Stop the killing now
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it now
Do it, do it, do it, do it, now
Do it, do it, do it, do it now 
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it...
ok...
and two and three and four, hey!
Hold on, hold on!
