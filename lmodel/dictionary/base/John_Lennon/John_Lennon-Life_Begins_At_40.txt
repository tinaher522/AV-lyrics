<song artist="John_Lennon" title="Life_Begins_At_40">
- "We'd like to welcome you here to the Dakota country and western club
And in return for miss Yoko Ono's wonderful gift of a very strange
I'd like, this morning, to sing you a little ditty that occurred to me in the throes of my sleep
It's called "Life Begins At 40"
They say life begins at forty
Age is just a state of mind
If all that's true
You know, that I've been dead for thirty-nine
And if life begins at forty
Well, I hope it ain't the same
It's been tough enough without that stuff
I don't wanna to be born again
Well, I tried to sweep the slate clean
With a new broom ev'ry day
If that don't work
I'll jerk around until my next birthday
Yeah, life begins at forty
Age is just a state of mind
Well, if all that's true
You know that I've been dead for thirty-nine
