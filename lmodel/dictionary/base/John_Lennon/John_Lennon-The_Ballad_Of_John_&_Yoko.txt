<song artist="John_Lennon" title="The_Ballad_Of_John_&_Yoko">
Standing on the dock at Southampton
Trying to get to Holland or France
The man in the Mac
Said, "You've gotta go back"
You know, they didn't even give us a chance
Christ, you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're gonna crucify me
Finally made the plane into Paris
Honeymooning down by the Seine
Peter Brown called to say
"You can make it okay
"You can get married in Gibraltar, near Spain"
Christ, you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're gonna crucify me
Drove from Paris to the Amsterdam Hilton
Talking in our beds for a week
The newspeople said
"Say, what're you doing in bed?"
I said, "we're only trying to get us some peace"
Christ, you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're gonna crucify me
Savin' up yer money for a rainy day
Givin' all yer clothes to charity
Last night the wife said
Oh boy when you're dead
You don't take nothin' with ya but your soul
Made a lightning trip to Vienna
Eating chocolate cake in a bag
The newspaper said
"She's gone to his head
"They look just like two gurus in drag"
Christ, you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're gonna crucify me
Caught the early plane back to London
Fifty acrons tied in a sack
The men from the press
Said, "we wish you success
"It's good to have the both of you back"
Christ, you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're gonna crucify me
The way things are going
They're gonna crucify me
The way things are going
They're gonna crucify me
