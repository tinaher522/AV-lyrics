<song artist="John_Lennon" title="Be_My_Baby">
The night we met I knew I needed you so
And if I had the chance I'd never let you go
So won't you say you love me
I'll make you so proud of me
We'll make them turn their heads every place we go
So won't you please
(be my be my baby)
Be my little baby
(my one and only baby)
Say you'll be my darling
(be my be my baby)
Be my baby now oh oh oh oh
I'll make you happy baby just wait and see
And for every kiss you give me I'm gonna give you three
Since the day I saw you
You know I was waiting for you
You know I will adore till eternity
So won't you please

(be my be my baby)
Be my little baby
(my one and only baby)
Say you'll be my darling
(be my be my baby)
Be my baby now oh oh oh oh
Instrumental
Since the day I saw you
You know I was waiting for you
You know I will adore till eternity
So won't you please
(be my be my baby)
Be my little baby
(my one and only baby)
Say you'll be my darling
(be my be my baby)
Be my baby now oh oh oh oh
