Incantation
(Oo, oo, oo)
Incantation
(Oo, oo, oo)
If ya ever meet the sweet rolling thunder
(Flying on the dead of the night)
Just call me if ya can't get his number
(Watching how that rattlesnake bites)
All he's got is real understanding
Smokin' through his medicine head
Watch him get down to the unreal voodoo
And shove it to the living dead
Incantation
(Oo, oo, oo)
Incantation
(Oo, oo, oo)
What's happenin,' found his face in a bad dream, momma?
(Flying on the dead of the night)
I woke up and then I let out a bad scream, ooh!
(Watching how that rattlesnake bites)
Rolling thunder said, "Ya got this one started"
What happened there, did the kid get high, high?
All the dog soldiers shootin' uncoke-a-cola
Get 'em dancin' 'til they lose their minds
Incantation
(Oo, oo, oo)
Ah, yeah!
Incantation
(Oo, oo, oo)
Shh! Rattlesnake, buddy!
(Watching how the rattlesnake bites)
Incantation coming to get you
Incantation coming
(Oh, here I come)
Incantation coming to get you
Incantation coming
(Oh, here I come)
Incantation coming to get you
Incantation coming
Incantation coming to get you
Incantation coming
(Come)
Incantation coming to get you
Incantation coming
(Come, oh, here I come)
Incantation coming to get you
(Come, come)
Incantation coming
(Oh, here I come)
Incantation coming to get you
Incantation coming
(Oh, here I come, come, come)
Incantation coming to get you
(Oh, here I come)
Incantation coming
(Come, come, come, oh, here I come)
Incantation
(Wow, wow, wow! Ah ha ha! Oh, here I come, watch it!)
Wow!
(Oh, here I come!)
