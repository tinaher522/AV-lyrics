<song artist="John_Lennon" title="Bony_Morone">
I got a girl named Bony Morone
She's as skinny as a stick of macaroni
Ought to see her rock and roll with her blue jeans on
She's not very fat, just skin and bones.
I love her and she loves me. Oh how happy now we can be,
Making love underneath the apple tree.
Well, I told her mama and her papa too
Just exactly what I wanna do
I wanna get married on a night in June
And rock and roll by the light of the silvery moon
She's my one and only, she's my heart's desire
She's a real upsetter, she's a real live wire
Everyone turns when my baby walks by,
She's something to see, really catches the eye
