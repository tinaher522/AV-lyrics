<song artist="John_Lennon" title="Angel_Baby">
It's just like heaven
being here with you.
You're like an angel,
too good to be true.
But after all, i love you, i do.
Angel baby, my angel baby.
Uh, uh, i love you,
uh, uh, i do,
no one can love you like i do.
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,
uh, uh, uh,
uh, uh, uh.
When you are near me
my heart skips a beat.
I can hardly stand on
my own two feet.
Because i love you, i love you, i do.
Angel baby, my angel baby.

Uh, uh, i love you,
uh, uh, i do,
no one can love you like i do.
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,
uh, uh, uh,
uh, uh, uh.
(yeh!)
Please, never leave me
blue and alone.
If you ever go,
i'm sure you'll come back home.
Because i love you, i love you, i do.
Angel baby, my angel baby.
Uh, uh, i love you,
uh, uh, i do,
no one can love you like i do.
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,
uh, uh, uh,
uh, uh, uh,
uh, uh, uh.
Uh
