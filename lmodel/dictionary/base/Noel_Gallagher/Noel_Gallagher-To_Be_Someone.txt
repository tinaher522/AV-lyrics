<song artist="Noel_Gallagher" title="To_Be_Someone">
To be someone must be a wonderful thing
A famous footballer a rock singer
Or a big film star
Yes I think that I would like, I would like that
To be rich and have a lot of fans
Have a lot of girls to prove that I'm a man
To be number one and loved by everyone
Getting drugged up with my trendy friends
They really dig me man and I dig them
And the money that I spent
It is like my fame and it's quickily gone
No more swimming in my guitar shaped pool,
No more reporters at my beck and call,
No more cocaine, it's only ground chalk,
And no more taxi's now we have to walk
But didn't we have a nice time?
Wasn't it such a nice time?
Didn't we have a nice time?
I realize I should've stuck to my guns
They shit me out just like a bastard son
And I lost myself
And I know that it was wrong, but it cost me a lot
No more drinking when the club shuts down
I'm out here on my ass with the rest of you clowns
I'm really scared without my bodyguard
And I'm sitting on my own in my expensive yard
But didn't I have a nice time?
Wasn't it such a nice time?
Didn't I have a nice time?
Wasn't it such a nice time?
Did I have a nice time?
Did I have a nice time?
I can't remember if I had a nice time
To be someone must be a wonderful thing(Ain't that the truth?)
