<song artist="Noel_Gallagher" title="The_Death_Of_You_And_Me">
High tide, summer in the city
The kids are looking pretty but isn't it a pity that
The sunshine is followed by the thunder
With thoughts of going under and is it any wonder
Why the sea is calling out to me
I seem to spend my whole life running from people who would be
The death of you and me
Cause I can feel the storm clouds sucking up my soul
High tide, life is getting faster
And no one has the answer, I try to face the day though
In a new way the bottom of a bottle
Is every man's apostle, let's run away together
You and me forever we'd be free
Free to spend our whole lives running from people who would be
The death of you and me
Cause I can feel the storm clouds sucking up my soul
Let's run away and see, forever we'd be free
Free to spend our whole lives running from people who would be
The death of you and me
Cause I can feel the storm clouds coming
Watching my tv, or is it watching me?
I see another new day dawning
It's rising over me, my mortality
And I can feel the storm clouds sucking up my soul
