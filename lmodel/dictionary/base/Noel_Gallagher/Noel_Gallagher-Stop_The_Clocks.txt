<song artist="Noel_Gallagher" title="Stop_The_Clocks">
Stop the clocks and turn the world around, let your love lay me down
And when the night is over there’ll be no sound
Lock the box and leave it all behind on the backseat of my mind
And when the night is over, where will I rise?
What if I’m already dead, how would I know?
What if I’m already dead, how would I know?
Lost inside my head behind a wall, do they hear me when I call?
And when the night is over, where will I fall?
And when the night is over, where will I fall?
But if I’m already dead, how would I know?
But if I’m already dead, how would I know?
Stop the clocks and turn the world around, let your love lay me down
And when the night is over there’ll be no sound
And when the night is over there’ll be no sound
And now the night is over there’ll be no sound
