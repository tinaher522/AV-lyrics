<song artist="Noel_Gallagher" title="A_Simple_Game_Of_Genius">
Oh, Cecilia, close your eyes and I will be with ya
I'm in the song that's rising over ya, close your eyes and drift away
Just the two of us broke up all the rules they made for us
Play a simple game of genius if you live to fight another day
Dream of all of the love you made
It’s there in your kaleidoscope eyes
All my life and all that I've ever had, love's waiting here
If you don't make up your mind, then how can I drift away
Don't let me be your guide then how can I drift away (drift away)
Times are dangerous think the future's got it in for us
Play a simple game of genius if you live to fight another day
Dream of all of the love you made
It’s there in your kaleidoscope eyes
All my life and all that I've ever had, love's waiting here for you
If you don't make up your mind, then how can I drift away
Don't let me be your guide then how can I drift away (drift away)
Dream of all of the love you made
It’s there in your kaleidoscope eyes
All my life and all that I've ever had, love's waiting here
Don't make up your mind then how can I drift away
Dont let me be your guide then how can I drift away (drift away)
Don't make up your mind then how can I live today
Forever we walk the light and you and drift away (drift away)
Drift away (drift away)
