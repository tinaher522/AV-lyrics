<song artist="Noel_Gallagher" title="Cum_On_Feel_The_Noize">
So you think you got an evil mind
Well I'll tell you honey
And I don't know why
I don't know why
So you think my singin's' out of time
Well it makes me money
And I don't know why
I don't know why
Anymore, oh no
So cum on feel the noize
Girls rock your boys
We'll get wild, wild, wild
We'll get wild, wild, wild
Cum on feel the noize
Girls rock your boys
We'll get wild, wild, wild
Til dawn
So you think you I got a funny face
Well I'm not worried
And I don't know why
I don't know why
Along about last week I stopped this race
I'm in no hurry
And I don't know why
I don't know why
Anymore, no no
So cum on feel the noize
Girls rock your boys
We'll get wild, wild, wild
Wild, wild, wild
Cum on feel the noize
Girls rock your boys
We'll get wild, wild, wild
Til dawn
Well you think we have a lazy time
You should know better
I don't know why
I don't know why
And you say I got a dirty mind
Well I'm a mean go-getter
I don't know why
I don't know why
Anymore, oh no
So cum on feel the noize
Girls rock your boys
We'll get wild, wild, wild
Wild, wild, wild
So cum on feel the noize
Girls rock your boys
We'll get wild, wild, wild
Til dawn
