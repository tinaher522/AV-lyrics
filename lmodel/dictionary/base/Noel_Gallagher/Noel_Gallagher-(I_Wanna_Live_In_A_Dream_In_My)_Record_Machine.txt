<song artist="Noel_Gallagher" title="(I_Wanna_Live_In_A_Dream_In_My)_Record_Machine">
Help me... define the light that's shining on me
To get back what they've taken from me
And build a little fire where it's cold
Show me... the path that leads to all the glory
The words that tell a sacred story 
And build a little fire where it's cold 
I wanna live in a dream in my record machine
I wanna piece of the world and everyone inside my mouth
And all the money I waste is in a matter of taste
I wanna piece of the world and you can't make me spit it out
Take me... back from the darkness where they sent me
Give hope to places where it can't be
And build a little fire where it's cold
You can't give me reason
I don't need one to shine
You can't give me a feeling
If it's already mine
'Cause I'm one in a million and if the sun don't rise upon on my soul
Then I'll blow...
