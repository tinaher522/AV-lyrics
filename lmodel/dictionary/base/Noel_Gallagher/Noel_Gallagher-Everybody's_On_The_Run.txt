<song artist="Noel_Gallagher" title="Everybody's_On_The_Run">
When you can't find the feeling
And all is the same and the pouring rain, y'know, y'know
Is coming out of the ceiling - falling from above
Falling in and out of love
A broken heart is still beating
In and out of time, hold your body next to mine, y'know, y'know
But you can't stop the bleeding
Sing to yourself and hold on
'Cos everybody's on the run, everybody's on the run
Hang in there love, you've got to hold on
Hang in there love, you've got to hold on
'Cos everybody's on the run, everybody's on the run
Everybody's on the run, everybody's on the run
You've been drifting and stealing
Trying to walk in my shoes
But they don't belong to you
(you know they don't)
If you can't find the meaning
Sing to yourself and hold on
'Cos everybody's on the run, everybody's on the run
Hang in there love, you've got to hold on
Hang in there love, you've got to hold on
'Cos everybody's on the run
Hang in there love, you've got to hold on
Hang in there love, you've got to hold on
'Cos everybody's on the run, everybody's on the run
Everybody's on the run, everybody's on the run
Hang in there love, you've got to hold on
You've got to be strong enough for love, y'know, y'know
Hang in there love, you've got to hold on
You've got to be strong enough for love, y'know, y'know
Hang in there love, you've got to hold on
You've got to be strong enough for love, y'know, y'know
Hang in there love, you've got to hold on
'Cos everybody's on the run, everybody's on the run
Everybody's on the run, everybody's on the run
