<song artist="Noel_Gallagher" title="Don't_Look_Back_In_Anger">
Slip inside the eye of your mind
Don't you know you might find a better place to play
You said that you'd never been
But all the things that you've seen will slowly fade away
So I start a revolution from my bed
Cos you said the brains I have went to my head
Step outside the summertime's in bloom
Stand up besides the fireplace take that look from off your face
You ain't ever gonna burn my heart out
So Sally can wait, she knows its too late as we're walking on by
Her soul slides away, but don't look back in anger I heard you say
Take me to the place where you go, where nobody knows if it's night or day
Please don't put your life in the hands of a Rock n Roll band
Who'll throw it all away
So I start the revolution from my bed
Cos you said the brains I have went to my head
Step outside the summertime's in bloom
Stand up beside the fireplace take that look from off your face
Cause you ain't ever gonna burn my heart out
So Sally can wait, she knows its too late as she's walking on by
My soul slides away, but don't look back in anger I heard you say
So Sally can wait, she knows its too late as she's walking on by
My soul slides away, but don't look back in anger I heard you say
So Sally can wait, she knows its too late as she's walking on by
My soul slides away, but don't look back in anger
Don't look back in anger, I heard you say
At least not today
