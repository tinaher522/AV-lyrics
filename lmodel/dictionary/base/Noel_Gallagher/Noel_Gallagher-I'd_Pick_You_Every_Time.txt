<song artist="Noel_Gallagher" title="I'd_Pick_You_Every_Time">
If i lead you to the line
 Roll me over on my side
 But i don't mean to be unkind
 I'd pick you every time
Shine a light on one and one
 Make love easier to find
 I didn't mean to cross the line
 I'd pick you every time
Sing for me the stories that you find
 Now make up my mind
 As long as you'd say you'd be my girl
 I would wait around for you until the end of time.
If i lead you to the line
 Roll me over on my side
 But i don't mean to be unkind
 I'd pick you every time
 I'd pick you every time
 I'd pick you every time
