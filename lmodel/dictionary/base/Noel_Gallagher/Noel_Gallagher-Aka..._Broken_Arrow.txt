<song artist="Noel_Gallagher" title="Aka..._Broken_Arrow">
Fallen angel, the broken arrow
She comfort me and ease my trouble mind
Shine a light out into the shadows
All the world they made me leave behind
 
Leave me in peace, I'm on the side of the angels
If I die in a dream then let me live my life
But all the lies that they have told me, they make me want to shiver
When I'm lost and I'm lonely
That's not going to ease my troubled mind
 
She's rolling over, a misty morning
Set the sail for where the four winds blow
She a siren and I'm a warning
Here to say I never told you so
 
Leave me in peace, I'm on the side of the angels
If I die in a dream then let me live my life
But all the lies that they have told me, they make me want to shiver
When I'm lost and I'm lonely
That's not going to ease my troubled mind
 
Leave me in peace, I'm all alone in my angel
She died in a dream, so I could live my life
But all the lies that they have told me, they make me want to shiver
When I'm lost and I'm lonely
That's not going to ease my troubled mind
That's not going to ease my troubled mind
Fallen angel, the broken arrow
She comfort me and ease my trouble mind
Shine a light out into the shadows
All the world they made me leave behind
