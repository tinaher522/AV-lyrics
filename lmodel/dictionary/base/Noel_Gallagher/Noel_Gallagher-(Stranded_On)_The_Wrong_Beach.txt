<song artist="Noel_Gallagher" title="(Stranded_On)_The_Wrong_Beach">
Falling, I see you on the way down
I'll meet you on the rebound somewhere in between
Calling out across the airwaves
Faces that you can't say are calling out for me
 
And oh me, oh my, say so long baby, bye-bye
Pour me one for the road, it's a long journey baby
Where it's gonna take me just depends on the weight of my load
Oh no, depends on the weight of my load
 
So long, see you in the next one
Cause everyone been and gone, there's no one here but me
 
And oh me, oh my, say so long baby, bye-bye
Pour me one for the road, it's a long journey baby
Where it's gonna take me just depends on the weight of my load
Oh no, depends on the weight of my load
 
And oh me, oh my, say so long baby, bye-bye
Pour me one for the road, it's a long journey baby
Where it's gonna take me just depends on the weight of my load
Oh no, depends on the weight of my load
Oh no, depends on the weight of my load
Oh no, depends on the weight of my load
 
Dry land sinking in the quicksand
Stranded on the wrong beach, come and rescue me
