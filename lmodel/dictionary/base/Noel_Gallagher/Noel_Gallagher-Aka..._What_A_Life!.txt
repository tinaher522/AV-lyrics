<song artist="Noel_Gallagher" title="Aka..._What_A_Life!">
Some day you might find your hero
Some say you might lose your mind
I'm keeping my head down now for the summer
I'm out of my mind man, pour me another
I'm gonna take that tiger outside for a ride
What a life, what a life
Keep on chasing down that rainbow
You never know what you might find
Over the sunset on the horizon
It may be a dream but it tastes like poison
I'm gonna take that tiger outside for a ride
What a life, what a life, what a life, what a life
What a life, what a life, what a life, what a life
Some day you might find your hero
Some say you might lose your mind
Woohoo, woohoo, woohoo, woohoo
Woohoo, woohoo, woohoo, woohoo
