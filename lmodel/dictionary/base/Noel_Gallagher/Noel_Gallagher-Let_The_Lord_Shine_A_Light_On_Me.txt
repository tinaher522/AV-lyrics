<song artist="Noel_Gallagher" title="Let_The_Lord_Shine_A_Light_On_Me">
When i feel like a drop in the ocean
 But there's no one else at sea
 And my body's bent and broken
 Let the lord shine a light on me
Now the voices in the distance
 Trying to sing their soul to sleep
 Then i'm drifting in the silence
 Let the lord shine a light on me
 Let the lord shine a light on me
If i raise you up to the top of the mountain
 Made you tell me what he seen
 And i'm standing on this island
 Did the lord shine a light on me?
 Did the lord shine a light on me?
 Did the lord shine a light on me?
