<song artist="Noel_Gallagher" title="Dream_On">
Oh me, oh my, I'm running out of batteries
I'm hanging from the ladder
The tears you cried are only meant to flatter me
That shit don't matter at all, taking the shots as I fall
Watching the wheels that go round and round
Serene in the air 'cause I love you lady
I dream on, ohhh, 'cause that songbird singing
Shout it out for me, shout it out for me, so come on now
 
One day at a time, I'm hiding from the razor blade
That's hanging in the kitchen
The kids are tired, they drunk up all their lemonade
The bitch keeps bitching and all, taking the shots as I fall
Wait for the wheels to come round and round
Serene in the air 'cause I love you lady
I dream on, ohhh, 'cause that songbird singing
Shout it for me, shout it for me, ohhh
Dream on, ohhh, 'cause it's got no meaning
Shout it for me, shout it for me
She go, la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la-la
I dream on, ohhh, 'cause that songbird singing
Shout it for me, shout it for me, ohhh
Dream on, ohhh, 'cause it's got no meaning
Shout it for me, shout it for me (come on)
Shout it for me (come on), shout it for me (come on)
Shout it for me (come on), shout it for me (come on)
Shout it for me (come on), shout it for me (come on)
Shout it for me (come on), shout it for me (come on)
Shout it for me (come on), shout it for me
