<song artist="Noel_Gallagher" title="Soldier_Boys_And_Jesus_Freaks">
All the people on the village green
Are gathered round their TV screens
To hear the government about to speak
About soldier boys and jesus freaks
They go on heaven on their holidays
The congregation hopes and prays
They leave their letters in the mail box
For lonely souls they could not save
Off and on I used hear the call
But she was just a baby doll
And all around them were the holy men
Who twist the word of way back when
She will kiss the sky and shelter the world from the rain
Put another record record on the jukebox
She might dance the night away
On and on we go and the rest of the world outside
May soon explode and there is no place we might hide
On and on we go and the rest of the world outside
May soon explode and there is no place we might hide
On and on we go and we kiss this world behind
Goodbye and on and on and on and on
All the people on the village green
Are gathered round their TV screens
To hear the government about speak
About soldier boys and jesus freaks
