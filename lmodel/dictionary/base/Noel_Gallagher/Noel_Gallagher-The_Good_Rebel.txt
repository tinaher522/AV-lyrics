<song artist="Noel_Gallagher" title="The_Good_Rebel">
Rain, like rain
I don't care for the sunshine
If heaven helps you, help yourself
I hope you never change
Rebel, let them help themselves
And wash the truth away
Evey man will follow them,
So what else can you say?
Won't you let my baby,
Won't you let my baby,
Let my baby's love come down like rain
Rain, like rain
I don't care for the sunshine
For every man that will pass scorn
On every passer-by
There will be a star that's born
To fill the empty sky
You dress me down when you call me up
So don't call me alive
If you won't let my baby,
If you won't let my baby,
Let my baby's love come down like rain
Rain, like rain
I don't care for the sunshine
