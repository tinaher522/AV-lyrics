<song artist="Lorde" title="White_Teeth_Teens">
We wouldn't be seen dead here in the day 
I guess you're lucky that it's dark now
And if I like it, then we'll stay
Impress the empress, take a shot now
We got the glow in our mouths
White teeth teens are out
White teeth teens are
Up for it
I know you love it when the hairpins start to drop
I like your reckoning
But we got our methods and there's nothing here to stop
To stop this
If you want, we'll help tonight to split its seams
Give the bruises out like gifts
You'll get the picture of your dreams
I won't be smiling but the notes from my admirers 
Fill the dashboard just the same ah, a ah
We got the glow in our mouths
White teeth teens are out
White teeth teens are
Up for it
I know you love it when the hairpins start to drop
I like your reckoning
But we got our methods and there's nothing here to stop
To stop this, when we're
Up for it
I know you love it when the hairpins start to drop
I like your reckoning
But we got our methods and there's nothing here to stop
To stop this
(And everything works out so good)
(I wear the robe like no one could)
(Everything works out so good)
I'll let you in on something big
(I wear the robe like no one could)
I am not a white teeth teen
(Everything works out so good)
I tried to join but never did
(I wear the robe like no one could)
The way they are, the way they seem
(Everything works out so good)
Is something else, it's in the blood
(I wear the robe like no one could)
Their molars blinking like the lights
(Everything works out so good)
In the underpass where we all sit
(I wear the robe like no one could)
And do nothing and love it
(Everything works out so good)
(I wear the robe like no one could)
(Everything works out so good)
(I wear the robe like no one could)
We got the glow in our mouths
(Everything works out so good)
(I wear the robe like no one could)
White teeth teens are out
(Everything works out so good)
(I wear the robe like no one could)
White teeth teens are out
