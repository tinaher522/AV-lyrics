<song artist="Lorde" title="Glory_And_Gore">
There's a humming in the restless summer air
And we're slipping off the course that we prepared
But in all chaos, there is calculation
Dropping glasses just to hear them break
You've been drinking like the world was gonna end (It didn't)
Took a shiner from the fist of your best friend (Go figure)
It's clear that someone's gotta go
We mean it, but I promise we're not mean
And the cry goes out (Haahaah)
They lose their minds for us
And how it plays out (Haahaah)
And now we're in the ring
And we're coming for blood
Oh oh, you could try and take us
Oh oh, but we're the gladiators
Oh oh, everyone a rager
Oh oh, but secretly, they're saviours
Glory and gore go hand in hand
That's why we're making headlines
Oh oh, you could try and take us
Oh oh, but victory's contagious
Delicate in every way but one (The swordplay)
God knows we like archaic kinds of fun (The old ways)
Chance is the only game I play with, baby
We let our battles choose us
And the cry goes out (Haahaah)
They lose their minds for us
And how it plays out (Haahaah)
And now we're in the ring
And we're coming for blood
Oh oh, you could try and take us
Oh oh, but we're the gladiators
Oh oh, everyone a rager
Oh oh, but secretly, they're saviours
Glory and gore go hand in hand
That's why we're making headlines
Oh oh, you could try and take us
Oh oh, but victory's contagious
No-one 'round here's good
At keeping their eyes closed
The sun's starting to light up
When we're walking home
Tired little laughs, gold-lie promises
We'll always win at this
I don't ever think about death
It's alright if you do, it's fine
We gladiate but I guess
We're really fighting ourselves
Roughing up our minds so we're ready
When the kill time comes
Wide awake in bed
Words in my brain
Secretly you love this
Do you even wanna go free?
Let me in the ring
I'll show you what that big word means
Oh oh, you could try and take us
Oh oh, but we're the gladiators
Oh oh, everyone a rager
Oh oh, but secretly, they're saviours
Glory and gore go hand in hand
That's why we're making headlines
Oh oh, you could try and take us
Oh oh, but victory's contagious
