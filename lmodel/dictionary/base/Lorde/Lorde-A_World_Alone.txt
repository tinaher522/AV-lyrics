<song artist="Lorde" title="A_World_Alone">
That slow burn wait, while it gets dark
Bruising the sun
I feel grown up with you in your car
I know it's dumb
We've both got a million bad habits to kick
Not sleeping is one
We're biting our nails, you're biting my lip
I'm biting my tongue
When people are talking, people are talking
When people are talking, people are talking
Raise a glass, 'cause I'm not done saying it
They all wanna get rough, get away with it
Let 'em talk 'cause we're dancing in this world alone
We're all alone, we're alone
All my fake friends and all of their noise
Complain about work
They're studying business, I study the floor
And you haven't stopped smoking all night
Maybe the Internet raised us
Or maybe people are jerks
When people are talking, people are talking (But not you)
When people are talking, people are talking
Raise a glass, 'cause I'm not done saying it
They all wanna get rough, get away with it
Let 'em talk 'cause we're dancing in this world alone
We're all alone, we're alone
All the double-edged people and schemes
They make a mess, then go home and get clean
You're my best friend, and we're dancing in a world alone
We're all alone, we're all alone
I know we're not everlasting
We're a trainwreck waiting to happen
One day the blood won't flow so gladly
One day we'll all get still
(When people are talking, people are talking)
(When people are talking, people are talking)
Get still
When people are talking, people are talking
When people are talking, people are talking
Raise a glass, 'cause I'm not done saying it
They all wanna get rough, get away with it
Let 'em talk 'cause we're dancing in this world alone
We're all alone, we're alone
All the double-edged people and schemes
(When people are talking, people are talking)
They make a mess, then go home and get clean
(When people are talking, people are talking)
You're my best friend, so we're dancing in a world alone
(When people are talking, people are talking)
We're all alone, we're alone
(When people are talking, people are talking)
When people are talking, people are talking
When people are talking, people are talking
When people are talking, people are talking
When people are talking, people are talking
Let 'em talk
