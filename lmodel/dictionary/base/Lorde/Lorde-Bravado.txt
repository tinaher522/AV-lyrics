<song artist="Lorde" title="Bravado">
All my life, I've been fighting a war
I can't talk to you or your friends
It's not only you, my heart jumps around
When I'm alluded to, this will not do
'Cause I was raised up to be admired
To be noticed, but when you're withdrawn
It's the closest thing to assault
When all eyes are on you, this will not do
I'm faking glory, lick my lips, toss my hair
And turn the smile on and the story's brand new
But I can take it from here
I'll find my own bravado
It's a switch flipped, it's a pill tipped back
It's a moon eclipsed, woah
And I can tell you that when the lights come on
I'll be ready for this
It's in your bloodstream, a collision of atoms
That happens before your eyes
It's a marathon run or a mountain you scale
Without thinking of size
I was frightened of every little thing
That I thought was out to get me down
To trip me up and laugh at me
But I learned not to want the quiet of a room
With no one around to find me out
I want the applause, the approval
The things that make me go
It's a switch flipped, it's a pill tipped back
It's a moon eclipsed, woah
And I can tell you that when the lights come on
I'll be ready for this
It's in your bloodstream, a collision of atoms
That happens before your eyes
It's a marathon run or a mountain you scale
Without thinking of size
I was frightened of every little thing
That I thought was out to get me down
To trip me up and laugh at me
But I learned not to want the quiet of a room
With no one around to find me out
I want the applause, the approval
The things that make me go
