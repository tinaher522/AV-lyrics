<song artist="Lorde" title="Million_Dollar_Bills">
There's nothing I want but money and time 
Million dollar bills and a tick tick tick tick 
There's nothing more cruel than only nine lives 
A limit in spite will do the trick trick trick trick 
We can leave the house, lead the party, let the people know 
Go drown the colors of our minds and watch the cards go 
There's nothing as fun as coming untied 
And running with the kids in the park park park park 
There's nothing that's hurt like letting you go 
Tiger burn eyes in the dark dark dark dark 
We can leave the house, leave the party, let the people know 
Go drown the colors of our minds and watch the cars go 
It's not about just being out with the right people 
'Cause we can get in trouble just by going free throw 
And now I'm letting you know 
And now I'm letting you know 
And now I'm letting you know
And now I'm letting you know
