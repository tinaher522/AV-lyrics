<song artist="Melanie_C" title="Let_There_Be_Love">
If you have something to tell me, or how you feel inside
I hope it is love
If you have a single question, I'd wanted to be this
Can you feel the love?
Tell me now
So I know
Why it makes you feel alive
Why it hurts to say goodbye
Why you'll never ever loose
What is meant to be with you
So Let there be love (x2)
Something you can live a all life in just a single day
Let the minutes flow
When you hear and other heart beat harmonising yours and you will know
It's feeling of
Something more
And opened her
It will make you feel alive
It will hurt to say goodbye
But you'll never ever loose
What is meant to be with you
So Let there be love (x2)
'Coz it's everything we needed
To like the air that we're breathing
And I know nothing can replace it
It's always leaving traces
Let there be love (x3)
Everything we need
Let there be love (x3)
Everything we need
I hope it's love
'Coz it's everything we needed
To like the air that we're breathing
And I know nothing can replace it
It's always leaving traces
Let there be love (x3)
Everything we need
I hope it's love
