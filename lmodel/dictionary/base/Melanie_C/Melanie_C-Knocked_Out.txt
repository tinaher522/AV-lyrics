<song artist="Melanie_C" title="Knocked_Out">
Knocked out
I can't get up, again
Knocked out
Can't find my feet, to stand
Thought I'd learn my lesson, didn't learn it so well
Slap my face I've fallen again
I'm knocked out
I can't get up again
Find my feet to stand
Need a helping hand
You've got me begging on my knees, oh baby please
Come back to me
Oh baby hold me now I'm begging you, so please
There is nothing I wouldn't do
Anything for you
Oh baby hold me now
I'm begging you so please
Knocked out
I don't who, I am
Knocked out
I don't where, I stand
Thought I'd learn my lesson, didn't learn it so well
Slap my face I've fallen again
I'm knocked out
By another man
I don't know where I stand
Don't know who I am
You've got me begging on my knees, oh baby please
Come back to me
Oh baby hold me now I'm begging you, so please
There is nothing I wouldn't do
Anything for you
Oh baby hold me now
I'm begging you so please
Could you turn this way
Come back to me
Come back where you're meant to me
Could you come back baby, I am begging please
Come back to me
You've got me begging on my knees, oh baby please
Come back to me
Oh baby hold me now I'm begging you, so please
There is nothing I wouldn't do
Anything for you
Oh baby hold me now
I'm begging you so please
