<song artist="Melanie_C" title="Anarchy_In_U._K.">
Right! now! (laughs)
I am an antichrist
I am a sporty spice
Don't know what I want but I know how to get it
I wanna destroy the passer by cos
I wanna be anarchy
No dogs body
Anarchy for the u.k
It's coming sometime and maybe
I give a wrong time stop a trafic line
Our future dream is a shopping scheme cos
I wanna be anarchy
In the city
How many ways to get what you want
I use the best I use the rest

And I use the enemy
And I use anarchy cos
I wanna be anarchy
It's the only way to be
Is this the m.p.l.a
Or is this the u.d.a
Or is this the i.r.a
I thought it was the u.k
Or just another country
Another council tenancy
I wanna be anarchy
Cos I wanna be anarchy
Oh what a name
And I wanna be anarchy
Get pissed destroy
