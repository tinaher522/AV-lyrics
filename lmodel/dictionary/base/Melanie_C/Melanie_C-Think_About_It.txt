<song artist="Melanie_C" title="Think_About_It">
I, I know I shouldn't be doing this
Why can't I stop?
Butterfly, bloodrush, everything's telling me to run
but I'm not
You only regret what you don't do
Why don't we do what we want to now ?
Don't give me time to back out
'Coz I don't wanna think about waking up, making up 
Lies trying to pretend that we didn't do
What we're doing
I don't wanna think about real life
Not tonight
I don't wanna think about anyone, anything, anyway
If there's a chance we'll break
I wanna smash into pieces 
Let's make a big mistake
But I don't wanna think about it
I don't wanna think about it
My heart beats my head
And I'm letting it
Take me over
I got to keep going
Can't stop, can't sleep
Cause tomorrow I'll be sober
You only regret what you don't do
Why don't we do what we want to now ?
Don't give me time to back out
'Coz I don't wanna think about waking up, making up
Lies trying to pretend that we didn't do
What we're doing
I don't wanna think about
Real life
Not tonight
I don't wanna think about anyone, anything, anyway
If there's a chance we'll break
I wanna smash into pieces 
Let's make a big mistake
But I don't wanna think about it
I don't wanna think about it
Only regret the things that you don't do, do, do, do 
What you want to
Only regret the things that you don't do, do, do, do
what you want to
I want to feel something
I've never felt before
And I don't care if it hurts
It's worth it yeah
I want to be someone I've never been before
So I'm gonna run and
I'm gonna close my eyes
I'm gonna jump into the fire
'Coz I don't wanna think about waking up, making up
Lies trying to pretend that we didn't do
What we're doing
I don't wanna think about
Real life
Not tonight
I don't wanna think about anyone, anything, anyway
If there's a chance we'll break
I wanna smash into pieces 
Let's make a big mistake
But I don't wanna think about it
I don't wanna think about it
Only regret the things that you don't do, do, do, do 
What you want to
Only regret the things that you don't do, do, do, do
Let's do what we want to
