<song artist="Melanie_C" title="Wonderland">
I can't remember yesterday
It isn't fair, there is no other way
Still I walk on
And I walk on
With a blade against my back for me to fall on
Time is not a friend to me
Dragging weighs me down
Pulling me in danger
Used to be a wonderland
Stable as a castle made of sand
And I reclaim
Mistakes that I made
And the scratches on my back that read out your name
Time is not a friend to me
Dragging weighs me down
Pulling me in danger
Time will never heal the pain
Blameless, you are not the same
Shameless, you are not a friend of mine
Time is not a friend to me
Dragging weighs me down
Pulling me in danger
Time is not a friend to me
Dragging weighs me down
Pulling me in danger
Time, is not a friend to me
Seems so hard to understand
I can't escape, escape the memory
Help me spin back through the years
To find a place that I once knew as wonderland
Wonderland
Wonderland
Wonderland
