<song artist="Melanie_C" title="Good_Girl">
I feel so bad
Never felt like this 'bout anything I never have
No, please don't tell me that
What's lost is lost it's never gonna come back home
I walk in circles when there's no one around
Try to find my own direction
I test the water but it burns my hand
As I disfigure my reflection
I've been a good girl but you let me down
I feel so bad
Never felt like this 'bout anything I never have
No, please don't tell me that
What's lost is lost it's never gonna come back home
I lie in silence and I just can't sleep
How I long for your affection
My eyes are tired and my body is weak
I can't handle this rejection
And I think it's mean how you let me down
I feel so bad
Never felt like this 'bout anything I never have
No, please don't tell me that
What's meant to be is meant to be it's no consolation
I'll carry on proving everyone wrong
I will succeed
I feel so bad
Never felt like this 'bout anything I never have
No, please don't tell me that
What's lost is lost it's never gonna come back home
I feel so bad
Never felt like this 'bout anything I never have
No, please don't tell me that
What's meant to be is meant to be it's no consolation
