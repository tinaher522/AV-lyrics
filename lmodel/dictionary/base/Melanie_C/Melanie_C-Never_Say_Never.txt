<song artist="Melanie_C" title="Never_Say_Never">
You say never say never baby
Does it make you feel like everything's alright?
I say why all of your fantasising
Who am I to burst your bubble
If it's all ya got to get you through another night
It's hard moving on 
You gotta draw the line
The feeling never comes back when it's gone
That was then, this is now
No turning back, no second time around
You're like a stuck record going round, round, round
You turn me off just gotta turn you down
So try to get it into your brain
Don't you ever say, never say never again
Now you're beginning to patronise me
Acting like there's nothing you don't know
But wild horses couldn't drag me back and make me
Live the life I left behind
'Cos the fact is that I'm so much better on my own
It's hard moving on 
You gotta draw the line
The feeling never comes back when it's gone
That was then, this is now
No turning back, no second time around
You're like a stuck record going round, round, round
You turn me off just gotta turn you down
So try to get it into your brain
Don't you ever say, never say never
Like a stuck record going round, round, round
You turn me off just gotta turn you down
So tired and it's always the same
Don't you ever say never say never say never again
I never thought that I would overcome the pain
I'd have to be a fool to go back there again 
Like a stuck record going round, round, round
You turn me off just gotta turn you down
So try to get it into your brain
Don't you ever say, never say never
Like a stuck record going round, round, round
You turn me off just gotta turn you down
So tired and it's always the same
Don't you ever say never say never say never again
