<song artist="Melanie_C" title="Paris_Burning">
I walked the boulevard, alone inside my heart.
Across the avenue, no winter grey and blue.
Hear the river sigh, but I just walk on by, so lost in you.
And I remember now your eyes were like the clouds.
You're smiling in my dreams, lies in every scene.
My life in flames, every word in vain, you slipped away, you stole the way.
I saw Paris burning, saw the world stop turning.
When you put your coat on to go, did you know you were killing my soul?
Every heart was hurting, when I saw Paris burning.
When you put your coat on to leave, you took away the biggest part of me.
I remember now, every fear and doubt,
You'd look me in the eye and swore you would never say goodbye
Dès que je te vois, je sens mon désespoir.
You lied to me to
Tu m'as menti.
I saw Paris burning, I saw the world stop turning.
When you put your coat on to go, did you know you were killing my soul?
Every heart was hurting, when I saw Paris burning.
When you put your coat on to leave, you took away the biggest part of me.
