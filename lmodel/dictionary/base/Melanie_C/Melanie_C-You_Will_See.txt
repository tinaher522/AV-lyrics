<song artist="Melanie_C" title="You_Will_See">
I'm caught up in a mystery way
I'm in a constant distant state
I pray for this to always be
The path that has been chosen for me
Cos it's got me spinning round and round, round and round
So high I can't touch the ground anymore
And it's all that I'm praying 
So let it rain, let it pour, call me names it won't phase me
I don't care what they say 
No denouncement could change me
Cos it's only a matter of time 'til it finds you
Try to run for your life, you'll still feel it behind you
You will see
You will, you will see
You will, you will see
Everybody starts with a clean slate
Only altered by unnecessary hate
I pray that I will never be
Affected by how you portray me
Cos it's got me spinning round and round, round and round
But I'm not scared of being down any more
Now there's no one controlling me
So let it rain, let it pour, call me names it won't phase me
I don't care what they say 
No denouncement could change me
Cos it's only a matter of time 'til it finds you
Try to run for your life, you'll still feel it behind you
You will see
You will, you will see
You will see
You will, you will see
I'm not a slave to your attention
Fuck your lies I'll never be a victim
I Fell from the sky, a perfect landing
Sheltered from the storm and all the rain
You will see
So let it rain, let it pour, call me names it won't phase me
I don't care what they say 
No denouncement could change me
Cos it's only a matter of time 'til it finds you
Try to run for your life, you'll still feel it behind you
Let it rain, let it pour, call me names it won't phase me
I don't care what they say 
No denouncement could change me
Cos it's only a matter of time 'til it finds you
Try to run for your life, you'll still feel it behind you
You will see
You will, you will see
You will see
You will, you will see
