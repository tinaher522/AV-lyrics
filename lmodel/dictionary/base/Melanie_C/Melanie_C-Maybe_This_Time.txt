<song artist="Melanie_C" title="Maybe_This_Time">
Maybe this time I'll be lucky
Maybe this time he'll stay
Maybe this time, for the first time
Love won't hurry away
He will hold me fast
I'll be home at last
Not a loser anymore
Like the last time
And the time before
Everybody loves a winner
So nobody loves me
Lady peaceful, lady happy
That's what I long to be
All the odds are in my favor
Something is bound to begin
It's gonna happen, happen sometime
Maybe this time I'll win
Everybody loves a winner
So nobody loves me
Lady peaceful, lady happy
That's what I long to be
All the odds are in my favor
Something's bound to begin
It's gonna happen, happen sometime
Maybe this time, maybe this time I'll win
