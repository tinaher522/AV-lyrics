<song artist="Melanie_C" title="Here_And_Now">
I walked the line so carefully
I took my time, I wondered
The here and now, what matters now
No looking back, that's over
I don't know what tomorrow brings
The sun may shine, the world come tumbling down
I don't care what went on before
But I'm sure of the here and now
I stood alone, the only one
I didn't know I was waiting
For liberty to feel like me
And now I'm here I'm not willing to change
I don't know what tomorrow brings
The sun may shine, the world come tumbling down
I don't care what went on before
But I'm sure of the here and now
The here and now
The here and now
If you choose we won't move
I'm here with you
The air is calm
No more to do
I don't know what tomorrow brings
The sun may shine, the world come tumbling down
I don't care what went on before
But I'm sure of the here and now
The here and now
I don't know what tomorrow brings
The sun may shine, the world come tumbling down
I don't care what went on before
But I'm sure of the here and now
The here and now
The here and now
