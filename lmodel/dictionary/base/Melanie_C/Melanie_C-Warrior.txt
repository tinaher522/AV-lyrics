<song artist="Melanie_C" title="Warrior">
I want to feel like a warrior 
With an army at my side 
Caus no harm, only protect me 
I want to feel like a conquer 
Anything that'd dare to stand in my way 
And I'm sure I could change for the better 
Everything would be ok 
I am a little older 
I still need you to take me over 
Chorus: 
With a little help, the help you give to me 
With a little faith, the faith you have in me 
With a little love, give me the strength that I need 
I want to feel I'm ascending 
So much higher than I've ever climbed 
And to not be afraid of the danger 
I want to feel I am worthy 
Of everything I have ever achieved 
I do not want to bask in the glory 
Of something that I don't believe 
This life is full of fear 
Let me know that you are here 
With a little help, the help you give to me 
With a little faith, the faith you have in me 
With a little love, give me the strength that I need 
With a little help, the help you give to me 
With a little faith, the faith you have in me 
With a little love, give me the strength that I need 
With a little help, the help you give to me 
With a little faith, the faith you have in me 
With a little love, give me the strength that I need
