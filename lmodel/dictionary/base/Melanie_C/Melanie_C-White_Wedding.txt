Hey little sister what have you done
Hey little sister who's the only one
Hey little sister who's your superman
Hey little sister who's the one you want
Hey little sister shot gun!
It's a nice day to start again
It's a nice day for a white wedding
It's a nice day to start again.
Hey little sister who's the one you're with
Hey little sister what's your last wish
Hey little sister shot gun, whoa yeah
Hey little sister superman
Hey little sister shot gun!
It's a nice day to start again
It's a nice day for a white wedding
It's a nice day to start again.
Take me back home, yeah

Hey little sister what have you done
Hey little sister who's the only one
I've been away for so long (so long)
I've been away for so long (so long)
I let you go for so long
It's a nice day to start again.
It's a nice day for a white wedding
It's a nice day to start again
There is nothin' fair in this world
And there's nothin' safe in this world
And there's nothin' sure in this world
Nothin' pure in this world
I said show me something in this world
Start again
It's a nice day for a white wedding
It's a nice day for a white wedding
It's a nice day for a white wedding
It's a nice day for a white wedding
It's a nice day for a white wedding
