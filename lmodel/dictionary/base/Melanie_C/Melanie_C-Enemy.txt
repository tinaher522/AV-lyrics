<song artist="Melanie_C" title="Enemy">
Caught in the chaos of life
Didn't know my own mind, did you?
Could you feel me drifting away?
If you did you didn't say, did you?
Locked in a world of your own
Beyond my control, somehow
Couldn't hear what I'm trying to say
You wouldn't listen anyway, not now.
We never really took the time
Only want to make it right
I wish I didn't but I miss you
If the lines are drawn
And the flags unfurl would you fight for me?
Or would you be my enemy?
When the conflict calls
In this tug of war
Will you be my strength?
Or would you be my enemy?
If I lose my way
On this battle ground
Will you reach for me?
Or would you be my enemy?
(Be my enemy)
If the lines are drawn
And the flags unfurl would you fight for me?
Or would you be my enemy?
(Be my enemy)
I can breathe without you by my side
I believed everything we did was right
I can heal this is just another fight
Another fight
We never really took the time
Only want to make it right
I wish I didnt but I miss you
Everything I wanted to be
Got buried in history, like you
Be my enemy, be my enemy
If the lines are drawn
And the flags unfurl would you fight for me?
Or would you be my enemy?
(Be my enemy)
When the conflict calls
In this tug of war
Will you be my strength?
Or would you be my enemy?
(Be my enemy)
The scars run deep but I'm gaining ground
In this gift to me there's a strength I've found
Will you stand with me or will you be my enemy?
(Be my enemy)
The scars run deep but I'm gaining ground
In this gift to me there's a strength I've found
Will you stand with me or will you be my enemy?
I can breathe without you by my side
I believed everything we did was right
I can heal this is just another fight
Another fight
I only want to make it right
Only want to make it right
Only want to make it right
With you
