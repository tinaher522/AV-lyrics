<song artist="Melanie_C" title="Goin'_Down">
How come I didn't see 
You were making fun of me 
How dare you change the rules 
You made me look a fool 
Well now you're gonna see 
The last laugh's not on on me 
What am I gonna do 
To get my revenge on you 
You're goin' down, goin' down 
Was it just another lie 
Or did I just breathe a sigh 
What else can I do 
I was so into you 
With all this bad luck I've had 
My karma must be bad 
You've played your little games 
Oh what a shame 
You're goin' down, goin' down. Goin' down 
I'm singing it loud and I don't care 
I'm singing it proud everywhere 

I feel no remorse 
My life is back on course 
From this little hitch 
I have become a super-bitch 
But don't be afraid 
By that confession I've made 
I am not a whore 
I have gone hardcore 
You're goin' down, goin' down 
Goin' down, goin' down... 
I'm singing it loud and I don't care 
I'm singing it proud everywhere 
I'm singing it loud and I don't care 
I'm singing it proud everywhere 
ha - ha - ha 
You're goin' down, goin' down 
You're goin' down, goin' down 
ha - yeah
