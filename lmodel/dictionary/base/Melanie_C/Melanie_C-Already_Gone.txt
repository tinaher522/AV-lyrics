<song artist="Melanie_C" title="Already_Gone">
I can't forget your face
The day, the time, the place
Your eyes so full of mystery
Only a fool thinks twice
I lost my paradise
You saw the good in me
But I, I looked away
I let you drive right by
I didn't realize I wanted you
Till you were gone
I wasted too much time
I learnt that love keeps moving on
But you're already gone
(Ooh, ooh)
You're already gone
(Ooh, ooh)
The one that got away
The one that made you pay
My karma's catching up with me
I feel you in my veins
I won't see you again
So scared to lose it all
I lost it anyway
I let you drive right by
I didn't realize I wanted you
Till you were gone
I wasted too much time
I learnt that love keeps moving on
But you're already gone
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, already gone)
But you're already gone
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, already gone)
You're already gone
You're already gone
Ooh, ooh
I let you drive right by
I didn't realize I wanted you
Till you were gone
I wasted too much time
I learnt that love keeps moving on
But you're already gone
I let you drive right by
I didn't realize I wanted you
Till you were gone
I wasted too much time
I learnt that love keeps moving on
(On)
But you're already gone
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, already gone)
But you're already gone
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, already gone)
Oh, oh, oh, yeah
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, already gone)
Already gone, already gone, ooh
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, already gone)
Already gone
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, already gone)
Ooh
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
