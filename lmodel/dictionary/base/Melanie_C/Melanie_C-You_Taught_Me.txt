<song artist="Melanie_C" title="You_Taught_Me">
You taught me how to be in love. 
Now I (I) just can't get enough 
(I just, I just can't get enough) 
You send me to a higher ground. 
Now I (I) just can't get enough 
(Just can't get enough) 
I've given up on make believing. 
I've given up on finding love. 
I've given up on my prince charming. 
I've given up on god of love. 
I never thought I'd find somebody. 
Who'd ever make me feel this way. 
Cos you taught me how to be in love 
Just what I was dreaming of. 
Taught me how to be in love I can't get enough. 
You send me up to higher ground. 
You have turned my life around. 
Taught me how to be in love I can't get enough. 
I had had my share of riches. 
I had had my share of wealth. 
Mama said it would be lonely. 
Being left up on the shelf. 
She never knew I'd meet somebody. 
Who makes me feel the way you do. 
Cos you taught me how to be in love 
Just what I was dreaming of. 
Taught me how to be in love I can't get enough. 
You send me up to higher ground. 
You have turned my life around. 
Taught me how to be in love I can't get enough. 
No no. 
And now you are my one and only. 
And I am never feeling blue. 
Never feeling blue. 
You taught me how to be in love 
Just what I was dreaming of. 
Taught me how to be in love I can't get enough. 
You send me up to higher ground. 
You have turned my life around. 
Taught me how to be in love, I can't get enough. 
No no. 
You taught me how to be in love. 
Now I (I) just can't get enough 
(I just, I just can't get enough) 
You send me to a higher ground. 
Now I (I) just can't get enough 
(I just can't get enough) 
You taught me how to be in love. 
Now I (I) just can't get enough 
(I just, I just can't get enough) 
You send me to a higher ground 
Now I (I) can't just get enough 
(I just can't get enough) 
Your love, can't get enough of your love. 
(I just, I just can't get enough) 
Your love, I can't get enough of your love. 
(I just can't get enough) 
Your love, can't get enough of your love. 
(I just can't enough)
