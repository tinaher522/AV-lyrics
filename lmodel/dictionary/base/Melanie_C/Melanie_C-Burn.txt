<song artist="Melanie_C" title="Burn">
If I was somebody else
I'd be calling me stupid
But I still do this
No way that your gonna change
Nothing to say that I wanna hear
I gotta get out of here
I've been driving down this road, with my eyes closed trying to get lost
But I know I'll be back again
And it's easy to escape, but as long as there's a way I can reach you, I know it's never gonna be over
I'm throwing matches I'm lighting dynamite
It never catches this bridge won't burn
I drop the lighter, into the gasoline
No fire this bridge won't burn burn burn
This bridge won't burn burn burn
Can't even say it's your fault
Cos I know it's me
That let's you let me down
Another last chance
But I'm not fooling anyone
You know better than anyone
I've been driving down this road, with my eyes closed trying to get lost
But I know I'll be back again
And it's easy to escape, but as long as there's a way I can reach you, I know it's never gonna be over
I'm throwing matches I'm lighting dynamite
It never catches this bridge won't burn
I drop the lighter, into the gasoline
No fire this bridge won't burn burn burn
This bridge won't burn burn burn
Maybe there's a reason why I'd rather be lonely with you
Than lonely alone
Tell me the reason why I'd rather be lonely with you
Than lonely alone
I'm throwing matches I'm lighting dynamite
It never catches this bridge won't burn
I drop the lighter, into the gasoline
No fire this bridge won't burn burn burn
This bridge won't burn burn burn
