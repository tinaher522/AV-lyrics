<song artist="Melanie_C" title="Angel_On_My_Shoulder">
Sometimes when I'm lonely.
I can feel you on the breeze.
In the darkness, when I'm sleeping.
You're the colour in my dreams.
And I'm not alone.
No I'm not alone.
You're the angel on my shoulder, you're always there.
You're the angel on my shoulder, I know you care.
I know you're there, angel.
Sometimes when I'm nervous.
And I try to catch my breath.
You're the the space between my heartbeats.
You're the reason I feel blessed.
And I'm not alone.
No I'm not alone.
You're the angel on my shoulder, you're always there.
You're the angel on my shoulder, now I'm not scared.
I know you're there, angel.
I know you watch me when I'm good or bad.
But I could never let you down, you always understand.
You're the angel on my shoulder, you're always there.
You're the angel on my shoulder, I know you care.
You're the angel on my shoulder, you're always there.
You're the angel on my shoulder, now I'm not scared.
I know you're there.
You're everywhere, angel.
