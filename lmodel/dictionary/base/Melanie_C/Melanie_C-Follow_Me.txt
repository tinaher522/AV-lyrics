<song artist="Melanie_C" title="Follow_Me">
Light comes in I watch you wake.
Wanting you so much my heart could break.
To touch your skin, to feel your hair.
I'd follow you anywhere.
Light goes out I watch you sleep.
Never imagine love so deep.
I close my eyes to breath the air.
I'd follow you anywhere.

  In the waves that wash over me, wash over you.
  Follow me, I'll follow you.
  Through your dreams to secret places.
  Here's my hand just take it.
  Do as I do.
  I'll follow you.

Nobody knows who made the stars.
Baby the whole world is ours.
From Liverpool to Leicester Square.
I'd follow you anywhere.

  Angels that watch over me, watch over you.
  Follow me, I'll follow you.
  Through your dreams to secret places.
  Where nobody can trace us.
  We'll make it through.
  I'll follow you.
  In the waves that wash over me, wash over you.
  Follow me, I follow you.
  When nobody can find you.
  I'll be right behind you.
  You make it through.
  I follow you.
  Follow me.
  I'll follow you.
  Through your dreams to secret places.
  Here's my hand just take it.
  Do as I do.
  I'll follow you.
