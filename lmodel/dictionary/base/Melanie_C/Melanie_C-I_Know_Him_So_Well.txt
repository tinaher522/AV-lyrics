<song artist="Melanie_C" title="I_Know_Him_So_Well">
Nothing is so good it lasts eternally
Perfect situations must go wrong
But this has never yet prevented me
Wanting far too much for far too long
Looking back I could have played it differently
Won a few more moments who can tell
But it took time to understand the man
Now at least I know I know him well
Wasn't it good? Oh, so good
Wasn't he fine? Oh, so fine
Isn't it madness he can't be mine?
But in the end he needs
A little bit more than me, more security
He needs his fantasy and freedom
I know him so well
No one in your life is with you constantly
No one is completely on your side
And though I'd move my world to be with him
Still the gap between us is too wide
Looking back I could have
Played things some other way
Learned about the man before I fell
I was just a little careless maybe
But I was ever so much younger then
Now at least I know I know him well
Wasn't it good? Oh, so good
Wasn't he fine? Oh, so fine
Isn't it madness he won't be mine?
Didn't I know how it would go?
If I knew from the start why am I falling apart?
Wasn't it good? Wasn't he fine?
Isn't it madness he won't be mine?
But in the end he needs
A little bit more than me, more security
He needs his fantasy and freedom
I know him so well
It took time to understand him
I know him so well
