<song artist="Melanie_C" title="Everything_Must_Change">
I'm beginning to get a little tired 
Of the misconceived idea of who you seem to think I am 
Although it looks that this come easy 
You know full well I've had my problems and I've cried 
Don't be so quick to criticize me 
Don't dismiss me out of hand 
It's not over, simply changing 
And no one is to blame 
I believe in what I'm feeling 
And nothing stays the same 
Everything must change 
Could anything I say provoke you? Take a chance 
Go ahead try something new 
Can you truly, hand in heart, admit you feel good 
About everything you say or do? 
I don't mean to criticize you 
You just need to understand 
It's not over, simply changing 
And no one is to blame 
Just believe in what you're feeling 
'Cos nothing stays the same 
No, don't fight it, don't deny it 
You'll find yourself again 
Just believe in what you're feeling 
'Cos nothing stays the same 
Everything must change 
Are we so different afterall? 
Everything must change 
It's not over, simply changing 
And no one is to blame 
Just believe in what you're feeling 
'Cos nothing stays the same 
No, don't fight it, don't deny it 
You'll find yourself again 
Just believe in what you're feeling 
'Cos nothing stays the same 
Everything must change 
It's not over 
Simply changing 
No don't fight it 
Don't deny it 
Everything must change
