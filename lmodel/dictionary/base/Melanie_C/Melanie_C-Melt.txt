<song artist="Melanie_C" title="Melt">
Caught in the eye of a storm
Where we are born
No truth is spoken
Seems so long ago
And you really don't know
How you got broken
Feel me
Give a little bit of love for your people
But save a little bit of love for yourself
Have a little bit of trust in the way you feel 
And see your heart melt
Send a little bit of hope down the airwaves
Find a little bit of gold it might help
Youíve got to have a little bit of faith in everything you know
Then let your heart melt
Now is your time to rise
Go on you can fly
I know why you sent me
Feel Me
Give a little bit of love for your people
But save a little bit of love for yourself
Have a little bit of trust in the way you feel 
And see your heart melt
Send a little bit of hope down the airwaves
Find a little bit of gold it might help
Youíve got to have a little bit of faith in everything you do
Then watch your heart feel your heart melt
Send a little bit of hope down the airwaves
Find a little bit of gold it might help
Youíve got to have a little bit of faith in everything you know
Then let your heart feel your heart melt
