<song artist="Melanie_C" title="Little_Piece_Of_Me">
I can see you think that you're the one
I could fall for you but I wouldn't waste my time
I should be less cynical but I've heard it all before
I know exactly what's on your mind
All you want me to be is a little souvenir 
Of a night that you won't even remember
It's not because I'm worth it
Not 'cause I deserve it
You just wanna get your hands on a little piece of me
It's not because you feel it
Not because you really mean it
You just wanna get your hands on a little piece of me
Don't think that I'm unapproachable
Playing games with you 'cause I wouldn't waste my time
I could be less cynical but I've heard it all before
Every single word of every line
All you want me to be is a little souvenir 
Of a night that you won't even remember
It's not because I'm worth it
Not 'cause I deserve it
You just wanna get your hands on a little piece of me
It's not because you feel it
Not because you really mean it
You just wanna get your hands on a little piece of me
But I don't wanna be 
Something you can talk about
That's something I could do without
I'm not like you
I can't fake it the way you do
You say you want me, well if it's true
It's not because I'm worth it
Not 'cause I deserve it
You just wanna get your hands on a little piece of me
It's not because you feel it
Not because you really mean it
You just wanna get your hands on a little piece of me
It's not because I'm worth it
Not 'cause I deserve it
You just wanna get your hands on a little piece of me
It's not because you feel it
Not because you really mean it
You just wanna get your hands on a little piece of me
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
