Beep beep'm beep beep, yeah
Asked a girl what she wanted to be
She said baby, can't you see
I wanna be famous, a star on the screen
But you can do something in between
Baby you can drive my car
Yes I'm gonna be a star
Baby you can drive my car
And baby I love you
I told a girl that my prospects were good
And she said baby it's understood
Working for peanuts is all very fine
But I can show you a better time
Baby you can drive my car
Yes, I'm gonna be a star
Baby you can drive my car
And baby I love you

Beep beep'm beep beep yeah
Baby you can drive my car (you can drive my car)
Yes, I'm gonna be a star (I wanna be a star)
Baby you can drive my car (oh yeah-yeah)
And baby I love you (beep beep beep beep beep beep yeah)
I told that girl I can start right away
And she said baby I got something to say
I got no car and it's breaking my heart
But I've got a driver and that's a start
Baby you can drive my car
Yes I'm gonna be a star
Baby you can drive my car
And baby I love you
Beep beep'm beep beep yeah
Beep beep'm beep beep yeah
Beep beep'm beep beep yeah
Beep beep'm beep beep yeah
