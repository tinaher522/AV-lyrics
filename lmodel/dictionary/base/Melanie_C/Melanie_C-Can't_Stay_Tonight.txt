<song artist="Melanie_C" title="Can't_Stay_Tonight">
Woke up again today
Before I got to sleep
But the time has come for me
To say what's on my mind
Something is telling me
I wandered in too deep
And the roses came
Too late to save the vine
Whatever happens to us
Is gonna happen to us
Baby, the feelings gone
We can't go on

Can't stay tonight
We're trouble deep
Can't stay no more
Grass is grown around my feet
And I don't think I can love you anymore
Can't stay tonight
You were the world to me
The sun that warmed the sky
But where the roses grow
They cannot stay and die
Look to your heart and see
The truth you can't deny
There's nothing left to say no need to cry
