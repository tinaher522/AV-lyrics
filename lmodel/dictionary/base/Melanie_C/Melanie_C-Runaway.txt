<song artist="Melanie_C" title="Runaway">
Continuously Question
Where this road is leading to 
This good vibe my intention 
There's something I feel I need to do 
Gotta run baby run baby run
Gotta run baby run baby run 
Gotta run baby run baby run baby run 
I wanna runaway 
I wanna change my name oh
I wanna shead this skin
A new life to begin 
The world is spinnin' faster
Feel like IÂ´m caught in a hurricane
Underrating this disaster
And there's only myself to blame 
Gotta run baby run baby run
Gotta run baby run baby run 
Gotta run baby run baby run baby run 
I wanna runaway
I wanna change my name oh
I wanna shed this skin
A new life to begin 
I wanna runaway
I wanna change my name oh
I wanna shead this skin
A new life to begin 
Gotta run baby run baby run
Gotta run baby run baby run 
Gotta run baby run baby run baby run 
I wanna runaway 
I wanna runaway
I wanna take a chance and never come back again
I wanna get away
I wanna get away
I wanna leave this mess behind I wanna start again
I wanna run I wanna run I wanna runaway 
I wanna run I wanna run I wanna runaway
I wanna run I wanna run I gonna runaway
