How does it feel to be on top of the world 
Now it's for real, you're on top of the world 
You're the top of the world 
Looking like it's gonna happen 
Knowing that the time is right 
With pride on our side and passion 
We've got the glory in our sights 
In streets all over the nation (Ian &amp; Simone) 
Are goals we painted on the walls (Ian&amp; Simone) 
Where all our hopes and expectations 
Are the world inside a ball (Ian&amp; Simone) 
Inside a ball (Ian&amp; Simone) 
So how does it feel to be on top of the world 
Now it's for real, you're on top of the world 
You're the top of the world 
These are the ties that bind us (Ian&amp; Simone) 
Everyone is part of the team (Ian&amp; Simone) 
Leaving our worries behind us (Ian&amp; Simone) 
'Cause we're sharing the same dream (Ian&amp; Simone) 
It's time to dream (Ian&amp; Simone) 
Goals are flying in we've made the news (Ian&amp; Simone) 
'Cause we were born to win we can't lose (Ian&amp; Simone) 
We can't lose (Ian&amp; Simone) 
It's time to dream 
Goals are flying in we've made the news 
'Cause we were born to win we can't lose 
We can't lose 
How does it feel to be on top of the world 
Now it's for real, you're on top of the world 
We're the top of the world 
Looking like it's gonna happen (Ian &amp; Tommy) 
Knowing that the time is right (Ian&amp; Tommy) 
With pride on our side and passion (Ian&amp; Tommy) 
We've got the glory in our sights (Ian&amp; Tommy) 
In streets all over the nation (Ian &amp; Mel C) 
Are goals we painted on the walls (Ian&amp; Mel C) 
Where all our hopes and expectations (Ian&amp; Mel C) 
Are the world inside a ball (Ian&amp; Mel C) 
Inside a ball (Ian&amp; Mel C) 
So how does it feel to be on top of the world 
Now it's for real, we're on top of the world 
How does it feel to be on top of the world 
Now it's for real, you're on top of the world 
England, England forever England 
Love you forever England 
(Top of the world, top of the world, 
top of the world, you're the top of the world, 
you're the top of the world, top of the world)
