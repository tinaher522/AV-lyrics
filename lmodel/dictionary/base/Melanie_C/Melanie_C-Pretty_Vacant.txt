<song artist="Melanie_C" title="Pretty_Vacant">
There's no point in asking us you'll get no reply
Oh just remenber a don't decide
I got no reason it's all too much
You'll always find us
Out to lunch !
We're so pretty oh so pretty
Vacant
We're so pretty oh so pretty
Vacant
Don't ask us to attend cos we're not all there
Oh don't pretend cos I don't care
I don't believe illusions cos too much is real
So stop your cheap comment
Cos we know what we feel
We're so pretty oh so pretty
Vacant
We're so pretty oh so pretty
Vacant

We're so pretty oh so pretty
We know, and we don't care
There's no point in asking us you'll get no reply
Oh just remenber a don't decide
I got no reason it's all too much
You'll always find us
Out to lunch !
We're so pretty oh so pretty
Vacant
We're so pretty oh so pretty
Vacant
We're so pretty oh so pretty
Vacant
We know, and we don't care
We're pretty, pretty vacant
We're pretty, pretty vacant
We're pretty, pretty vacant
We're pretty, pretty vacant, and we don't care
