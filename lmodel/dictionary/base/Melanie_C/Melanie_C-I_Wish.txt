<song artist="Melanie_C" title="I_Wish">
Lookin back on when I
Was a little nappy-headed boy
Then my only worry
Was for Christmas what would be my toy
Even though we sometimes would not get a thing
We were happy with the joy the day would bring
Sneaking out the back door
To hangout with those hoodlum friends of mine, ooh yeah
Greeted at the back door
Boy, thought I told you not to go outside.
Trying the best to bring the water to your eyes
Thinking it might stop her from whoopin' your behind.
I wish these days could come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go
I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go
Cause I loved them so
Do-do do-do do do do do do do do do
Do-do do-do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do do do do do do
Do-do do-do do do do do do do
Brother says he's tellin
About you playin doctor with that girl
Just don't tell, I'll give you
Anything you want in this whole wide world
Mama gives you money for Sunday school
You trade yours for candy after church is through
Smoking cigarettes and
Writing something nasty on the wall (you nasty boy)
Teacher sends you to the
Principal's office down the hall
You grow up and learn that kinda thing ain't right
But while you were doin it, it sure felt outta sight
I wish these days could come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go
I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go
Do-do do-do do do do do do do do do
Do-do do-do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do do do do do do
Do-do do-do do do do do do do
