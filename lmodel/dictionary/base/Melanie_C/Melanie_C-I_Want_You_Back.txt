<song artist="Melanie_C" title="I_Want_You_Back">
Every day, in my thoughts, you're my one obsession.
Can't go on, need a fix, this is my confession.
When you're not around the nights go along.
You may be with her but with me you belong.
I am the only one, I am the only one.
  I want you back.
  Whatever you do.
  I want you back.
  I've got nothing to prove.
  I don't care what you said.
  Want you back in my bed.
  I want you back.
  I want you back.

Can't let go, guess you know now I've blown my cover.
What I want, what I need is no other lover.
Try to deny it but you know it's true.
No-one can make you feel like you do.
I am the only one.
I am the only one.

  I want you back.
  Whatever you do.
  I want you back.
  I've got nothing to prove.
  I don't care what you said.
  Want you back in my bed.
  I want you back.
  I want you back.

You can't keep running away from me.
When something feels so right then it's meant to be.
Like a dog with a bone I won't let go.
Won't let go.
Try to deny it but you know it's true.
No-one can make you feel like I do.
I am the only one.
I am the only one.

  I want you back.
  Whatever you do.
  I want you back.
  I've got nothing to prove.
  I don't care what you said.
  Want you back in my bed.
  I want you back.
  I want you back.
  I want you.
  I need you.
  I want you.
  I need you.
  I want you, I need you.
  I want you, I need you.
  I want you, I need you, ooooh.
