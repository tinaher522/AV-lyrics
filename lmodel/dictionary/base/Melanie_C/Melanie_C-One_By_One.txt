<song artist="Melanie_C" title="One_By_One">
Woke up with the morning sun
Another day has just begun
But all i think about is you
Woke up in this paradise
Golden sands and bluer skies
But all i think about is you
Remember we were back in our old pad
All the simple pleasures that we had
When all we needed was each other
I can see a light in your eye
Telling me that love hasn't died
We can ride the changes that come
You're still the one
Wo-oah
Wo-o-o-oah
We can ride the changes that come
We can pick the pieces up one by one
You tell me i don't give you time
You're questioning what's on my mind
But all i think about is you
Thinking back to summer days
You could steal my heart away
With just a glance in my direction
And i can see a light in your eye
Telling me that love hasn't died
We can ride the changes that come
You're still the one
Wo-oah
Wo-o-o-oah
We can ride the changes that come
We can pick the pieces up one by one
And i am coming home tonight
To bring our love back to life
Stop this ride
I'm getting off
To start again with you my love
Oh i am coming home tonight
To bring our love back to life
Stop this ride
I'm getting off
To start again with you my love
Wo-oah
Wo-o-o-oah
We can ride the changes that come
We can pick the pieces up one by one
