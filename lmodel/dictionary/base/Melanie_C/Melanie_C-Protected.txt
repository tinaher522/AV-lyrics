<song artist="Melanie_C" title="Protected">
Do you spend your life hiding in the shadows?
Terrified of letting down your guard
Do you fantasise of glorious tomorrows
Come alive you're perfect as you are
Careless lies will hurt you no more
'til the angels cry and the music dies
You and I will be protected
'til this earth burns out and stops turning round
I will keep you protected
We're protected
Walk away from those who bring you sorrow
Take a chance I know you still believe
Letting go of everything you can't control
Open up the life you long to lead
Precious heart unlock the door
'til the angels cry and the music dies...
Every moment you're affected
By a light so divine
From the darkness we're protected
With the truth in our hearts we can shine
'til the angels cry and the music dies...
I'll always love you
I'll always love you
I'll always love you
In this life we're protected
We're protected
I will keep you protected.
