<song artist="Melanie_C" title="Beautiful_Intentions">
I couldn't help but open my big mouth
As I assumed into you the words fell out
Well you asked me the question and I just couldn't lie
But why did you bother when you knew what you'd find
No no no
I didn't mean to leave standing in the dark
So blind that I can't decide if you knew that I harboured
Beautiful Intentions for you
So cruel that I never knew truly
If you harboured beautiful intentions for me
When they give you your identity
Tell me will you recognise yourself?
You're so influenced by the things that you hear
Down with the smoke screen to make everything clear
Oh Oh Oh
You gotta learn to live and take it in your stride
So blind that I can't decide if you knew that I harboured
Beautiful Intentions for you
So cruel that I never knew truly
If you harboured beautiful intentions for me
So Blind
So Blind
So Blind
So Blind
Jaded with exhausting pressure
Will I feel like this forever?
Fades inconsistent pleasure
Wear me down wear me out
Jaded with exhausting pressure
Will I feel like this forever?
Fades inconsistent pleasure
Wear me down wear me out
So blind that I can't decide if you knew that I harboured
Beautiful Intentions for you
So cruel that I never knew truly
If you harboured beautiful intentions for me
I wanna know did I disappoint you?
It still hurts to mention the words that were spoken now
I wanna know, are you contemplating?
The beautifully intented yet tainted impression of me
So blind that I can't decide if you knew that I harboured
Beautiful Intentions for you
So cruel that I never knew truly
If you harboured beautiful intentions for me
