<song artist="Melanie_C" title="Better_Alone">
I understand your point of view
Letting me go, but I thought you had more faith
Everything I've done for you, you made the mistake
So now you throw this in my face
And I have worked so hard for you
All of this time and you pass me aside
I understand your point of view
I can't seem to get my head around
All the things that I feel good about always seem to disappear
And every time I think I've got this all worked out
Something chews me up and spits me out
But there's nothing left to fear, I'm better alone my dear
You couldn't pick a better time, to give me the news
Why don't you kick me when I'm down?
I always believed in you
Defended your name
But you have not been true
I gave you so much of my life
I come from miles and you tell me goodbye
You couldn't pick a better time
I can't seem to get my head around
All the things that I feel good about always seem to disappear
And every time I think I've got this all worked out
Something chews me up and spits me out
But there's nothing left to fear, I'm better alone my dear
I know, I really should thank you for setting me free
It's really amazing the changes I'm starting to feel
It's not gonna be long till I'm feeling strong
Deliverance helped me heal
Still I wonder if you ever wish you still had me!!!!
Will I ever get my head around
All the things that I feel good about always seem to disappear
And every time I think I've got this all worked out
Something chews me up and spits me out
But there's nothing left to fear
No, no, no!
I can't seem to get my head around
All the things that I feel good about that always seem to disappear
No, nooo
And every time I think I've got this figured out
Something chews me up and drags me down
But there's nothing left to fear
I'm better alone my dear
