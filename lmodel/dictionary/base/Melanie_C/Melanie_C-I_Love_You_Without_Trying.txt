<song artist="Melanie_C" title="I_Love_You_Without_Trying">
I love you without trying 
Driving along in a storm, but we're together
Mountains could fall to the ground, we don't hear a sound
I hear your voice
Simply divine
I have no choice
I'll tell you why
I love you without trying
It's always been that way
I love you without trying
And in your arms I stay
Even when we are apart, I'm never lonely
You are a space in my heart no one could fill
Millions of stars
Are lighting the sky
Feeling the sparks
I'll tell you why
I love you without trying
It's always been that way
When my heart was dying
You took my pain away
Even when the sun is gone
You're the light to guide me home
And be the best in everything I do
You are every part of me
You make me who I want to be
A higher love is what I feel for you
I love you without trying
It's always been that way
When my heart was dying
You took my pain away
