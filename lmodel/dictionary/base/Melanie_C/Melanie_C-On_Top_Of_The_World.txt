<song artist="Melanie_C" title="On_Top_Of_The_World">
How does it feel to be on top of the world
Now it's for real, you're on top of the world
You're the top of the world
Looking like it's gonna happen
Knowing that the time is right
With pride on our side and passion
We've got the glory in our sights
In streets all over the nation [ian &amp; simone]
Are goals we painted on the walls [ian&amp; simone]
Where all our hopes and expectations
Are the world inside a ball [ian&amp; simone]
Inside a ball [ian&amp; simone]
So how does it feel to be on top of the world
Now it's for real, you're on top of the world
You're the top of the world
These are the ties that bind us [ian&amp; simone]
Everyone is part of the team [ian&amp; simone]
Leaving our worries behind us [ian&amp; simone]
'cause we're sharing the same dream [ian&amp; simone]
It's time to dream [ian&amp; simone]
Goals are flying in we've made the news [ian&amp; simone]
'cause we were born to win we can't lose [ian&amp; simone]
We can't lose [ian&amp; simone]
It's time to dream
Goals are flying in we've made the news

'cause we were born to win we can't lose
We can't lose
How does it feel to be on top of the world
Now it's for real, you're on top of the world
We're the top of the world
Looking like it's gonna happen [ian &amp; tommy]
Knowing that the time is right [ian&amp; tommy]
With pride on our side and passion [ian&amp; tommy]
We've got the glory in our sights [ian&amp; tommy]
In streets all over the nation [ian &amp; mel c]
Are goals we painted on the walls [ian&amp; mel c]
Where all our hopes and expectations [ian&amp; mel c]
Are the world inside a ball [ian&amp; mel c]
Inside a ball [ian&amp; mel c]
So how does it feel to be on top of the world
Now it's for real, we're on top of the world
How does it feel to be on top of the world
Now it's for real, you're on top of the world
England, england forever england
Love you forever england
(top of the world, top of the world,
Top of the world, you're the top of the world,
You're the top of the world, top of the world)
