Right! Now! (laughs)
I am an antichrist 
I am a sporty spice
Don't know what I want but I know how to get it
I wanna destroy the passer by cos
I wanna be anarchy
No dogs body
Anarchy for the U.K
It's coming sometime and maybe
I give a wrong time stop a trafic line
Our future dream is a shopping scheme cos
I wanna be anarchy
In the city
How Many ways to get what you want
I use the best I use the rest 
And I use the enemy
And I use anarchy cos 
I wanna be anarchy
It's the only way to be
Is this the M.P.L.A 
Or is this the U.D.A 
Or is this the I.R.A 
I thought it was the U.K 
Or just another country 
Another council tenancy 
I wanna be anarchy
Cos I wanna be anarchy
Oh what a name 
And I wanna be anarchy
Get pissed destroy
