<song artist="Melanie_C" title="Living_Without_You">
Where will you go
Is there something I could say to make you stay
I don't know
But I know I'll never feel this way again
This moment in time
Has got me thinking
After everything you said
I'm so easily mislead, oh-oh-oh
When you leave me I'll be empty
I'll wander down a lonely road
Living without you
Nothing I can do, oh-oh
Where have you gone
Was it something that I said that made you go
All alone
It was you that made the plan that led me on
This moment in time
Has got me thinking
After everything you said
I'm so easily mislead, oh-oh-oh
And when you leave me I'll be empty
I'll wander down a lonely road
Living without you
Nothing I can do, oh-oh
And when you go it won't be easy
My love will burn and fade away
Living without you
How will I get through
How will I get through
(How will I get through)
This moment in time
Has got me thinking
After everything you said
I'm so easily mislead, oh-oh-oh
And when you leave me I'll be empty
I'll wander down a lonely road
Living without you
Nothing I can do, oh-oh
And when you go it won't be easy
My love will burn and fade away
Living without you
How will I get through
(How will I, how will I)
And when you leave me I'll be empty
I'll wander down a lonely road
Living without you
Nothing I can do, oh-oh
[fade]
