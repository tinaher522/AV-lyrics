<song artist="Melanie_C" title="I_Just_Don't_Know_What_To_Do_With_Myself">
I just don't know what to do with myself
Don't know just what to do with myself
I'm so used to doing everything with you
Planning everything for two and now that we're through
I just don't know what to do with my time
I'm so lonesome for you it's a crime
Going to a movie only makes me sad
Parties make me feel as bad when I'm not with you
I don't know what else to do
Like a summer rose, it needs the sun and rain
I need your sweet love to beat all the pain
I just don't know what to do with myself
Don't know just what to do with myself
Baby, if your new love ever turns you down
Come back, I will be around, just waiting for you
I don't know what else to do
Like a summer rose, it needs the sun and rain
I need your sweet love to beat all the pain
I don't know just what to do with myself
I don't know just what to do with myself
So baby, if your new love ever turns you down
Come on back, I will be around, just waiting for you
I don't know what else to do, no, no, no
I don't know what else to do
I'm still so crazy for you, no, no, no, no
I don't know what else to do, no, no, no, no
I just don't know what to do
