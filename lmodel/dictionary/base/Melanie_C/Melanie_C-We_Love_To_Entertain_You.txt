<song artist="Melanie_C" title="We_Love_To_Entertain_You">
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Here we go, come on get ready to roll
Baby we ain't goin' home
Till the sun goes down and the light begins to rise
Come with me, see all the things we can see
We're alive, we can fly, we are free
Feeling right and love is in your eyes
Hold on tight me, don't let go
Yeah yeah, we love to entertain you
Yeah yeah, together we can get through
Yeah yeah, we love to entertain you
Yeah yeah, together we can make it through
Don't delay, tell me that you wanna stay
Anytime I am here wanna play
Day or night you can decide
Don't let go, you're in control
Love is in your eyes
Yeah yeah, we love to entertain you
Yeah yeah, together we can get through
Yeah yeah, we love to entertain you
Yeah yeah, together we can make it through
Yeah yeah, we love to entertain you
Yeah yeah, together we can get through
