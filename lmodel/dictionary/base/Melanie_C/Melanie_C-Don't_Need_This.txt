<song artist="Melanie_C" title="Don't_Need_This">
City limits never change
Whispers keep me hunted
Though I challenge everything I remain captivated
Trying to leave this life behind
I have become the hunter
Now I'm planning my attack and I will surely rise again
Running from yourself isn't gonna save you
I don't need this I don't need you
I'm hitting back for what you put me through
I'm over this I'm over you
I'm taking back what I have given you
I don't need this I don't need you
I'm taking back what I have given you
I'm over this I'm over you
I'm hitting back for what you put me through
I don't need this I don't need you
I don't need this don't need you
Time has rediscovered me and everything I wanted
Now I'm standing here alone
Your presence haunts me
I had the strength to overcome
And introduce the fighter
No longer hidden in my self-inflicted pain and misery
Running from yourself isn't gonna save you
I don't need this I don't need you
I'm hitting back for what you put me through
I'm over this I'm over you
I'm taking back what I have given you
I don't need this I don't need you
I'm taking back what I have given you
I'm over this I'm over you
I'm hitting back for what you put me through
Am I lying to myself?
Is it wrong, is it right?
Trying too hard to impress
I wanna belong, feel alright
Am I lying to myself?
Am I wrong, am I right?
Running from yourself is never gonna save you
I don't need this I don't need you
I'm hitting back for what you put me through
I'm over this I'm over you
I'm taking back what I have given you
I don't need this I don't need you
I'm taking back what I have given you
I'm over this I'm over you
I'm hitting back for what you put me through
I don't need this I don't need you
I don't need this, don't need you
