<song artist="Melanie_C" title="Ain't_No_Stopping_Us">
Oh, yeah
Oooh Ooooh
Yeah Yeah
Go Mel
Ain't no stoppin' us now 
We're on the move 
(Hey)
Ain't no stoppin' us now 
We've got the groove 
(Hey)
Mel, take a way
There've been so many things that have held us down, down
But now it looks like things are finally comin' around, 'round
I know we've got a long, long way to go
And were we'll end up, I don't know 
Don't you let nothin', nothin' 
(Stand in your way)
I want y'all to listen, listen 
(To every word I say, every word I say)
Ain't no stoppin' us now 
We're on the move (ho, ooh, ooh)
Ain't no stoppin' us now 
We've got the groove (yeah ohh) 
(I'm in loving)
Ain't no stoppin' us now 
We're on the move 
See ya after the break
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ain't no stoppin' us now 
We've got the groove 
The moving, the moving 
(Grazie a Maurizio per questo testo)
