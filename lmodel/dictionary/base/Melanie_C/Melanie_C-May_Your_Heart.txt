<song artist="Melanie_C" title="May_Your_Heart">
May your heart be never alone when
The dawn's breaking
May your life be a rolling stone when
The ground starts shaking
And the world is waking
All I can tell you is to know who you are
And if they hurt you they can never do you harm
And if you want to you can love 'em till
The cold turns warm
May your kiss always feel like the first kisses
And may your truth help you heal
May you catch big fishes and get all your wishes
All I can tell you is to know who you are...
If you want me (I will be there)
If you need me (I will be there)
If you want me (I will be there)
Can you hear me?
If you're waiting (I will be there)
Your heart's aching (I will be there)
If you need me (I will be there)
Can you hear me?
And when you're lonely (I will be there)
When you call me (I will be there)
If you need me (I will be there)
Believe me I'm going nowhere
May your heart be never alone.
