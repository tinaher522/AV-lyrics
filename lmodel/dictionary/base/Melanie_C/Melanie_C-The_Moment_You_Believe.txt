<song artist="Melanie_C" title="The_Moment_You_Believe">
Time to face what you are hiding from
Don't have to do this on your own
Together we are strong
We don't need anyone
No matter what they say the time has come
I'm ready now to start a new beginning
With all our hopes and all our dreams
And I know the stars will shine for you and for me
From the moment you believe
I know they think that I'm no good for you
But we both know that they're wrong
Together we can fight
Show everyone we're right
I don't care what they say our time has come
I'm ready now to start a new beginning...
When you believe there's nothing you can't overcome
When you believe the earth is brighter than the sun
I believe
I'm ready now to start a new beginning...
