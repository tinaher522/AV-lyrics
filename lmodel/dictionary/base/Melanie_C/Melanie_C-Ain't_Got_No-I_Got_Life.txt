<song artist="Melanie_C" title="Ain't_Got_No-I_Got_Life">
Ain't got no home, ain't got no shoes
Ain't got no money, ain't got no class
Ain't got no friends, ain't got no schooling
Ain't got no worth, ain't got no job
Ain't got no mind
Then what have I got
Why am I alive anyway?
Yeah, what have I got
Nobody can take away
I got my hair, got my head
Got my brains, got my ears
Got my eyes, got my nose
Got my mouth, I got my smile
I got my tongue, got my chin
Got my neck, got my boobies
Got my heart, got my soul
Got my back, I got my sex
Ain't got no father, ain't got no mother
Ain't got no children, ain't got no faith
Ain't got no earth, ain't got no water
Ain't got no ticket, ain't got no token
Ain't got no love
Then what have I got
Why am I alive anyway?
Yeah, what have I got
Nobody can take away
I got my hair, got my head
Got my brains, got my ears
Got my eyes, got my nose
Got my mouth, I got my smile
I got my tongue, got my chin
Got my neck, got my boobies
Got my heart, got my soul
Got my back, I got my sex
I got my arms, got my hands
Got my fingers, got my legs
Got my feet, got my toes
Got my liver, got my blood
I got life, I got my freedom, I got life
I've got my life, I've got my freedom
I've got my life, I've got my freedom
I've got a life, I've got my freedom
I've got a life, I've got my freedom
