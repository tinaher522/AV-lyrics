<song artist="Melanie_C" title="Independence_Day">
I'm not thinking about ya
I'm happy without ya
No matter what they say
This is my Independence
They say it's a small small world
But you're a million miles away
Wishing on that same bright star
I shouldn't wish my life away
Without you the night still falls
And I know the sun will rise
The truth is that life goes on
Sure as oceans pull the tide
We've got forever baby
We just haven't got tonight
Aww baby!
Not thinking about ya
I'm happy without ya
No matter what my friends say
You're not my one and only
I ain't feeling lonely
This is my Independence Day
My Independence Day
I guess we've made mistakes
And we'll just have to live and learn
Cause I've got no regrets
It doesn't mean that I don't burn
The sands of time still fall
No matter what they say
Too many sad goodbyes
I can't dwell on yesterday
We've got forever baby
We've got as long as it feels right
Aww baby!
Not thinking about ya
I'm happy without ya
No matter what my friends say
You're not my one and only
I ain't feeling lonely
This is my Independence Day
My Independence Day
Heyy my Independence Day
No matter what comes my way
I'm gonna live for today
This is my Independence Day
Awww yeah yeah
Not thinking about ya
I'm happy without ya
No matter what my friends say
You're not my one and only
I ain't feeling lonely
This is my Independence Day
My Independence Day
No matter what comes my way
My Independence Day
Wishing on that same bright star
I shouldn't wish my life away
Wish my life away
They say it's a small small world
They say it's a small small small small world
Happy without ya
No matter what my friends say
You're not my one and only
I ain't feeling lonely
This is my Independence.
