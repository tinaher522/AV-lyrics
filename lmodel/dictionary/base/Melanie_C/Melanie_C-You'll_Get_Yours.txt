<song artist="Melanie_C" title="You'll_Get_Yours">
Should have trusted my own feelings
But I silenced intuition
When you sacrificed your honesty
I believed that you would be there
To protect me and help me with all I'm going through
There's a joy to being free
That you could have taken from me
But I found the strength to walk away
If you turn the pages and you look inside
There is nothing of me I feel that I have to hide
If you turn the tables and look at yourself
Is there something you fear that you would have to confess?
Many things will come to pass
I can live with that
I can't help but wonder when you'll get yours
I'm so happy I have moved on
I heard you are regretful
But you sacrificed your dignity
With the power you have abused
You disgust me and trust me I'm not the only one
Haven't I already proved
That I'm better off without you
I'm so glad I walked away
If you turn the pages and you look inside
There is nothing of me I feel that I have to hide
If you turn the tables and look at yourself
Is there something you fear that you would have to confess?
Many things will come to pass
I can live with that
I can't help but wonder when
For all the lies and your manipulation
For all the times I never felt good enough
You pushed me round
And put me down
To satisfy your childish ego
For all the times you made me feel worthless
The power struggles now I couldn't care less
It's after you
There's nothing you can do
What goes round comes round
If you turn the pages and you look inside
There is nothing of me I feel that I have to hide
If you turn the tables and look at yourself
Is there something you fear that you would have to confess?
Many things will come to pass
I can live with that
I can't help but wonder when you'll get yours
