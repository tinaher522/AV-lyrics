<song artist="Melanie_C" title="Love_To_You">
Love to me
Is beautiful
Beautiful
And cruel
Love to you
Is dangerous
And dangerous
Is cool
When there's nothing else to do
And there's nothing on TV
If that's love to you
Well it isn't love to me
And if there's nothing left to say
Then there's nothing we can do
If that's love to you
Love to me
Should be glamorous
Adventurous
And sometimes sad
Love to you
Is curious
But it's nothing more (nothing more)
To you than there (nothing there)
When there's nothing else to do
And there's nothing on TV
If that's love to you
Well it isn't love to me
And if there's nothing left to say
Then there's nothing we can do
If that's love to you
If that's love to you
If that's love to you, oh-whoa
Love to me
Is history
Cos the mystery
Leaves you cold
When there's nothing else to do
And there's nothing on TV
If that's love to you
Well it isn't love to me
And if there's nothing left to say
Then there's nothing we can do
If that's love to you
If that's love to you
Is that love to you-oh-whoa
