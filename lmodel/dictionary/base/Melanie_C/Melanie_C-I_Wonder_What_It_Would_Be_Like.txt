<song artist="Melanie_C" title="I_Wonder_What_It_Would_Be_Like">
I've seen you every day
I've known you for a while
You always say Hello
I love the way you smile
Do you have any idea
What seein' you does to me?
I'm not living any kind of life
I'm livin' in a fantasy
I wonder what it would be like
if we turned out the lights.
I wonder what it would be like
I'm running for you, wanna adore you
Who would be the first to strike?
If you stayed the night
I wonder what it would be like
to Love you.
Well don't you think it's strange?
Fate brought you to my side.
I was doing crunches
You were on a stationary bike.
I had given up on love
I'd met too many freaks,
Ever since i was seven-teen
I've been on this loosing streak.
I wonder what it would be like
if we turned out the lights.
I wonder what it would be like
I'm running for you, wanna adore you
Who would be the first to strike?
If you stayed the night
I wonder what it would be like
to Love you
