<song artist="Melanie_C" title="Here_It_Comes_Again">
Hey don't you worry
Everything's all right you know
We're gonna be just fine
If the rain crashes down over you
I will love you dry 
There is nobody in this world 
could ever take me away from you
I am always by your side
If you need someone to guide you dear
I'd like to try
Don't give up on something 
You've never had before
[Never thought that we would together]
I promise you this
You're the one I adore
Here it comes again
Filling my soul
Never want to let go
Here it comes again
Be at one with your love
As below so above
Here it comes again
My love is flowing
Freer than a waterfall
Beyond the edge of time
Surrender to the emotion
Now we can fly, we can fly
And you know there's a reason
That we are who we are [who we are]
I can not resist,You're the one I adore
Here it comes again
Filling my soul
Never want to let go
Here it comes again
Be at one with your love
As below so above
Here it comes again
Just like there's always gonna be a place
For you and me a ship that we can sail on
Just like if one and one were three
And everything was free at the end of some rainbow
Just like a needle and a gun a suckle in the sun
or knock upon a hidden door
It is you I adore
Here it comes again
Filling my soul
Never want to let go
Here it comes again
Be at one with your love
As below so above
Feel it comming again
Filling my soul
Never want to let go
Here it comes again
Be at one with your love
As below so above
Yeah Yeah
