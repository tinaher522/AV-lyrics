<song artist="Melanie_C" title="Don't_Let_Me_Go">
There's times when fake goodbyes made you cry
But this time you don't
And I was only joking 
I was broken when you told me to go
Don't make up the wrong mind
Don't forget the good times
Let me stay a little longer
Cause if I'm gone I can't make it right
In just one night 
We could go back in time maybe
Go back and find where we both went wrong
It won't take long, I know
Don't let me go
Oh don't let me go
"I'm not giving up, I'm still in love"
Is all I need you to say
And I don't need an answer
Just a chance to make the pain go away
So don't make up the wrong mind
Don't forget the good times
Let me stay a little longer
Cause if I'm gone I can't make it right
In just one night 
We could go back in time maybe
Go back and find where we both went wrong
It won't take long, I know
Don't let me go
Oh don't let me go
I beg you to find what it takes
To forgive me of all my mistakes
Cause if I walk out of your life
There'll be no way back this time
Don't let me go
Don't make up the wrong mind
Don't forget the good times
Stay a little longer 
Cause if I'm gone I can't make it right
In just one night 
We could go back in time maybe
Go back and find where we both went wrong
It won't take long I know
Don't let me go
Oh don't let me go
