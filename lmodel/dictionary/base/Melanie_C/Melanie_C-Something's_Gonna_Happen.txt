<song artist="Melanie_C" title="Something's_Gonna_Happen">
A shadow falls across the sky.
The silence is a lullaby.
Room is spinning, close my eyes.
Something's gonna happen, something's gonna change.
Distant voices call my name.
I'm like an insect in a flame.
The darkness overcomes my shame.
Something's gonna happen, something's gonna change.

Fly away, find a way to find me.
The night is near, and you are here.
To take my living breath away.
Dream Weaver, Soul Believer.
Feeding on my nervous fever.
Soul Catcher, Body Snatcher.
Feel the fever.

Out of sight, not out of mind.
Love is cruel, love is blind.
Cast a spell, drink the wine.
Something's gonna happen, something's gonna change.
Taste the danger, oh so sweet.
Feel the hunger, feel the heat.
My heart is falling at your feet.
Something's gonna happen, something's gonna change.

Fly away, find a way to find me.
The night is near, and you are here.
To take my living breath away.
Dream Weaver, Soul Believer.
Feeding on my nervous fever.
Soul Catcher, Body Snatcher.
Feel the fever, coming atcha.
Dream Weaver, Soul Believer.
Living on my nervous fever.
Soul Catcher, Body Snatcher.
Feel the fever.
Oh, oh yeah.
Oh, oh yeah.
Something's gonna happen, something's gonna change.

Oh, oh yeah.
Oh, oh yeah.
Something's gonna happen, something's gonna change.
