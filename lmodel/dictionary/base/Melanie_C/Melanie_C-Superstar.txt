<song artist="Melanie_C" title="Superstar">
Sign a name, sign away,
Every hour, every day
You're living your dream
Play the game, take the blame,
For the power and the fame
You're living your dream
Sell your life, sell your soul,
Telling everyone you know
You're living your dream
And You know that you're good
Cos they told you you could be
The next best superstar
And you know you can sing
And you'll do anything to be
The next best superstar
You're the next best superstar
Make a joke, do the show,
Where does all the money go,
You're living your dream
Crack a smile, in denial,
Throw your morals on the fire,
You're living your dream
Sell your life, sell your soul,
Tellin' everyone you know,
Your living your dream
And you know that you're good
Cos they told you you could be
The next best superstar
And you know you can sing
And you'll do anything to be
The next best superstar
You're the next best superstar
Ooooh
Now you're broken
Now they brought you down
Now your crawling out
You're the next best superstar
And you know that you're good
Cos they told you you could be
The next best superstar
And you know you can sing
And you'll do anything to be
The next best superstar
You're the next best superstar
You're gonna be, Yeah, (the next best superstar)
You're gonna be, Yeah, (the next best superstar)
The next best superstar, (the next best superstar)
The next best superstar
