<song artist="Melanie_C" title="Rock_Me">
Rock me baby (Rock me baby, rock me baby)
Rock me baby,
Rock me better into the beat,
You make me wanna throw my hands in the air, air, air
Rock me baby,
Rock me, take me over come on let's go
Everybody throw your hands in the air, air, air
Waiting, for you
Will you do, what I want you to?
Beautiful, fever,
Taking me, deeper
I lose myself, in myself,
I'll meet you there, in another world
Hear the crowd, feel the drums
Here we go! Come on! Come on!
Rock me baby,
Rock me better into the beat,
You make me wanna throw my hands in the air, air, air
Rock me baby,
Rock me, take me over come on let's go
Everybody throw your hands in the air air air
Stronger, deeper, music, set me free
Beating, faster, music, remedy
Snapshots, speed of sound
In my head, spinning round
Levitate, off the ground
Getting up, getting down,
Let me see you jump now!
Rock me baby,
Rock me better into the beat,
You make me wanna throw my hands in the air, air, air
Rock me baby,
Rock me, take me over come on let's go
Everybody throw your hands in the air, air, air
Rock me baby,
Rock me better into the beat,
You make me wanna throw my hands in the air, air, air
Rock me baby,
Rock me, take me over come on let's go
Everybody throw your hands in the air air air
Stronger, deeper, music, set me free
Beating, faster, music, remedy
Rock me baby
Rock me baby
Rock me
Rock me baby
Rock me baby
Rock me
Rock me
Rock me
Rock me
Rock me
Rock me baby,
Rock me better into the beat,
You make me wanna throw my hands in the air, air, air
Rock me baby,
Rock me, take me over come on let's go
Everybody throw your hands in the air air air
Stronger, deeper, music, set me free
Beating, faster, music, remedy
Rock me baby
