<song artist="Melanie_C" title="When_You're_Gone">
I've been wandering around the house all night
Wondering what the hell to do
I'm trying to concentrate but all I can think of is you
Well the phone don't ring 'cause my friends ain't home
I'm tired of being all alone
Got the tv on 'cause the radio's playing songs
That remind me of you
Baby when you're gone
I realize I'm in love
The days go on and on
And the nights just seem so long

Even food don't taste that good
Drink ain't doing what it should
Things just feel so wrong - baby when you're gone
I've been driving up and down these streets
Trying to find somewhere to go
Ya I'm lookin' for a familiar face but there's no one I know
This is torture, this is pain
It feels like I'm gonna go insane
I hope you're coming back real soon
'cause I don't know what to do
