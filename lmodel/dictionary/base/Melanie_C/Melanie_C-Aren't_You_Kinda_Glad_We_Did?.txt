<song artist="Melanie_C" title="Aren't_You_Kinda_Glad_We_Did?">
Oh it really wasn't my intention
To disregard convention
It was just an impulse that had to be obeyed
Though it seems convention we've been scorning
I'll still not go in warning
Though my reputation is blemished, I'm afraid
With just one kiss
What heaven, what rapture, what bliss!
Honestly, I thought I wouldn't
Naturally, I thought I couldn't
And probably I shouldn't
But aren't you kinda glad we did?
Actually, it all was blameless
Never the less, they'll call it shameless
So let's keep the lady nameless
But aren't you kinda glad we did?
Socially, I'll be an outcast
Obviously, we'll dine alone
On my good name there will be doubt cast
With never a sign of any chaperone
No matter how they may construe it
Whether or not we have to ruin
Whatever made us do it
Well aren't you kinda glad we did?
Aren't you kinda glad we did?
