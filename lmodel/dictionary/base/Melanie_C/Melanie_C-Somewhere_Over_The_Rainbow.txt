<song artist="Melanie_C" title="Somewhere_Over_The_Rainbow">
Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I heard of
Once in a lullaby
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream
Really do come true
Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far
Behind me
Where troubles melt like lemon drops
Away above the chimney tops
That's where you'll find me
Somewhere over the rainbow bluebirds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then - oh, why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh, why can't I?
