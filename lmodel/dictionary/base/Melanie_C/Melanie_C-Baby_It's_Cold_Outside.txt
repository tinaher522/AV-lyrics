<song artist="Melanie_C" title="Baby_It's_Cold_Outside">
I really can't stay
But baby it's cold outside
I've got to go way
Whoa, but it's cold outside
This evening has been
In hopin that you'd drop in
So very nice
I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice
My mother will start to warn me
Beautiful, what's your hurry
My father will be pacing the floor
Listen to the fireside roar
Well really, I should just scurry
Beautiful, please don't hurry
But maybe just to have a drink more
Put a record on while I pour

The neighbors might say
Oh baby it's bad out there
Say what's in this drink
No cabs to be had out there
I wish I knew how
Your eyes are like starlight now
To break this spell
I'll take your hand, your hair looks swell
I ought to say no, no, no, no sir
Mind if I move in closer
At least I can say that I tried
What's the sense of hurting my pride
I really cant stay
Oh baby don't hold out, oh cos it's...
Baby it's cold outside
