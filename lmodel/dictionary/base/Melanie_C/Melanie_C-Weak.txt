<song artist="Melanie_C" title="Weak">
Every single morning I wake up and there's a moment of bliss
Then I remember, I get up and I get on with what I chose but oh how I wish,
We could go back in time
And find the part we lost
Go back to where we started off
Every single morning I wake up
And I've been waiting, right here, for things to get better
And I've been patient, trying to figure this out
Everyone else is saying, what don't kill you makes you stronger
So why do I feel so weak, so weak, so weak
I can feel you loving me like tiny little wounds when I breath,
And time is so unkind and I am covered up in scars that should be starting
To heal
But I'm not moving
It's like I'm stuck in fantasies,
Rerunning made up memories
I can feel you loving me baby
And I've been waiting, right here, for things to get better
And I've been patient, trying to figure this out
Everyone else is saying, what don't kill you makes you stronger
So why do I feel so weak, so weak, so weak
And I hate the way I feel, I can't control myself
It's like you stripped away my strength and made me someone else
Why am I stuck here?
Cos I've been waiting, ooh
And I've been patient
Everyone else is saying, what don't kill you makes you stronger
So why do I feel?
Cos I've been waiting, right here, for things to get better
And I've been patient, trying to figure this out
Everyone else is saying, what don't kill you makes you stronger
So why do I feel so weak, so weak, so weak
So weakâ€¦
