<song artist="Melanie_C" title="I_Turn_To_U">
When the world is darker than I can understand
When nothing turns out the way I planned
When the sky turns gray and there's no end in sight
When I can't sleep through the lonely night
I turn to you like a flower leaning toward the sun
I turn to you 'cause you're the only one
Who can turn me around when I'm upside down
I turn to you
When my insides are wracked with anxiety
You have the touch that will quiet me
You lift my spirit, you melt the ice
When I need inspiration, when I need advice
I turn to you like a flower leaning toward the sun
I turn to you 'cause you're the only one
Who can turn me around when I'm upside down
I turn to you
Where would I be? What would I do?
If you'd never helped me through
I hope someday if you've lost your way
You could turn to me like I turn to you
I turn to you like a flower leaning toward the sun
I turn to you 'cause you're the only one
Who can turn me around when I'm upside down
I turn to you
I turn to you when fear tells me to turn around
I turn to you 'cause you're the only one
Who can turn me around when I'm upside down
I turn to you, I turn to you, I turn to you
