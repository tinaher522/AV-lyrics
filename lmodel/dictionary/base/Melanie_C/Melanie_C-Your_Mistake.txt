<song artist="Melanie_C" title="Your_Mistake">
I should concentrate on slowing down
Cause all I wanna do is drive fast
I don't think I know my way around
I'm seeing what I've already passed
I've been racing through my life without
Really knowing where I fit in
It's only dreams and my reflection now
Where I still see him
I might break
I'm all that's left from your mistake
I'm still trying to prove myself to you
I can't escape from this as fast as you
All these years don't fade away my feelings
I only see us leaving
I convince myself I understand
So there isn't anybody to blame
If you'd tried and played a different hand
I wonder if I'd still be the same
All this time I've watched you moving on
Running from the way that we were
Even though I know the girl is gone
You still see her
I might break...
I'm not frozen I just feel the cold
When all these memories open up again
I might break
I'm all that's left from your mistake
I'm still trying to prove myself to you
I can't escape from this as fast as you
You see him gone
I only see us leaving
See us leaving
I only see us leaving
See us leaving
See us leaving oh oh...
