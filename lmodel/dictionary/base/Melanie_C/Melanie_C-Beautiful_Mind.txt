<song artist="Melanie_C" title="Beautiful_Mind">
In her eyes, another moment dies
Tears roll
I so all'd your eyes
Heart don't down the middle, time stoles the past
Smile just a little takes her away
A thousand stories never told
A million dreams she won't let go
The singing, singing, stops her thinking
Her life looks prettier inside
So many reasons she is alone
Countless friends she'll never know
She's singing, singing, singing, singing
Lost in her beautiful mind
Lost in her beautiful mind
Here we stand
No memories to plan
Through our hands
Hopes that drift in sand
You'll never forget her
Neither can he
Who ended up better
Who do you believe
A thousand stories never told
A million dreams she won't let go
The singing, singing stops her thinking
Her life looks prettier inside
So many reasons she is alone
Countless friends she'll never know
She's singing, singing, singing, singing
Lost in her beautiful mind
Lost in her beautiful mind
Nobody is gotta save her now
'Cos everybody wants to save themselves
Nobody is gotta save her now
A thousand stories never told
A million dreams she won't let go
The singing, singing, stops her thinking
Her life looks prettier inside
So many reasons she is alone
Countless friends she'll never know
She's singing, singing, singing, singing
Lost in her beautiful mind
Singing, Singing, Singing, Singing
Let's sing together
Lost in her beautiful mind
Singing, Singing, Singing, Singing
Let's sing together
Lost in her beautiful mind
Singing, Singing, Singing, Singing
Let's sing together
Lost in her beautiful mind
Let's sing together
