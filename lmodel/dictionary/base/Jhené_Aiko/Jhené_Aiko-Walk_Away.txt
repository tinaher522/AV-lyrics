(Jhene Talking)
Look, I know I was wrong.
But you could just hear me out.
I never meant to hurt you.
But he was cute.
Ooh No, No, Ooh No.
(1st Verse)
Now,baby I know I was wrong, would you please listen to me.
See I never meant to hurt you but,
I just had to go do me.
See he was just a part time love.
Someone there to feel the space.
But trust me baby when I tell you that,
He could never take your place.
Dont walk away.
(Chorus)
Baby dont walk away from me.(I need you baby)
I need you here with me.
I know I was wrong but I dont wanna move on.
(wanna move on)
We've been down for so long.(so long)
(Dontchu walk away from) Dont walk away,
from me.
(2nd Verse)
And it was so confusing cause'.
Liking him while I love you.
I know that may sound contidictoriary.
So now you telling me I gotta choose.
So either way I loose.
