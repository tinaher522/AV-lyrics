<song artist="JhenÃ©_Aiko" title="Happy">
[Verse 1]
Last night
I was thinkn bout back in the day
When you and I was so happy together every way
But now reminiscing 
I can see the signs was right in front of my face
So I guess you was right the fault's mine
[B Section]
Say you loved me
What ever
So completely
What ever
I see you was wrong but guess what baby
[Hook]
I got a smile on my face
Don't trip
Didn't take long to get over you
I'm good ain't got no attitude
I found another on the quick finer than you
And that's the truth
Fool I'm happy for you
[Verse 2]
Shorty, it was only one mistake
Can you forgive me
You and me
We got a special thing
I can't let you go no

One more time girl you know I got chu
You know I'll take care of you
Give you anything
Be the man you want me to be
Your everything
You know I love you
[B Section]
Girl I love you 
(What ever)
Come on now girl
Lemme show you
(What ever)
I know I was wrong
Then you shoulda kept a smile on my face 
[Hook]
[Break]
Come on tell me how does it make you feel
To know I don't need your love
I'm happy for ya
Come on tell me how does it make you feel
To know that he hot
You not
I'm happy for ya
I'm telling you fool
[Hook Out]
