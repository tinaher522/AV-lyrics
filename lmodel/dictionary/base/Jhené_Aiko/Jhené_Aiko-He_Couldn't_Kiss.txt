(intro)
uh yeah
Uh, what, what, what, what

Yeah, what, what, what
uh, bounce
uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
what, yeah, come on, come on
(1st verse)
we pass each other in the club
and I notice that he be checkin me
I hope he gets the nerve to push up
or maybe even dance with me
(b-section)
we didn't dance, but we got to talk (got to talk)
before I knew it, girl we hit it off, (hit it off)
I didn't know it would happen so quick (no)
And out of nowhere came a kiss
(ew, dang)
(hook)
he was cute and all
but girl I tell you he couldn't kiss at all
wish I had known before I took the fall
you can't judge a guy just by his looks at all
he couldn't kiss at all
(2nd verse)
from the jump he had it going on
I knew he had everything I need
I wanted to be down because
It seem like he was right for me
(b-section)
(hook 2x)
(he was a cutie but, and girl I tell you I wish)
(bridge (kissing sound))
(no, no, no, no, no)
(oh, no, no, no, no)
(Guy:) Damn
He couldn't kiss at all
he was a cutie but
and girl I tell you I wish
(Guy:)
that's right (4x) Jhene
(hook (3x))
(B2K (I think):) girl I tell you he just couldn't
wish I had known before I
you can't judge a guy by his
not at all (3x)
he couldn't kiss at all
oh, oh silly boy
I tell you he couldn't kiss
no, I really wish it, by his looks at all
oh, no, no, he couldn't kiss at all, I really wish I had known
now I know now we cannot kiss tonight
