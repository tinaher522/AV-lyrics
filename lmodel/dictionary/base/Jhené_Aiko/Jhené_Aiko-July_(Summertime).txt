[Verse 1: Drake]
Yeah
Uh, This verse start's as my sniper hits they mark
And your guards fall down from a rifle to the heart
Like, clap, clap, let em fall slow
I know you had your fears, you can let em all go
And most woman are motivated so I act accordingly
But this is so refreshing that it means a little more to me
Dedicating time when I really can't afford to be
I provide protection if you open up the door for me
Couple stairs
Couple text
Couple dates
Couple I think that we're readys
Couple I think that we should we waits
Are we acting like a couple
I'm just trying to get it straight
Cuz I'm over convinced cuz it's too early for mistakes
[Jhene Aiko: Hook]
Ohhhh, you had to change up the game
Ohhh, the weather is not the same
Now there's only cloudy days
Can't stand the rain in July
Oh July
Let the fireworks explode
Exploding
Now it's getting colder
Leaves are turning color
Why?
It's just not our season
The one and only reason
Baby oh Baby oh
Our summer turned into fall
[Verse 2: Drake]
Damn, tell me where did all the magic go
I followed the rules and told you everything you had to know
Had you over every night
Everynight was passionate
Plus, you met my mother even if it was an accident
I'm confused tell me where we go wrong
I was sure that I would be with you for so long
I was planning on this on being something worth mentioning
Energy invested in someone I saw potential in
Who killed chivalry
They need to get they sentencing
Meanwhile we arguing and I can't get a sentence in
And just as I predicted here we go again
They always say the hottest love has the coldest end
[Jhene Aiko: Hook]
Ohhhh, you had to change up the game
Ohhh, the weather is not the same
Now there's only cloudy days
Can't stand the rain in July
Oh July
There were fireworks exploding
Exploding
Now it's getting colder
Leaves are turning color
Why?
It's just not our season
The one and only reason
Baby oh baby oh summer turned into fall
[Jhene Aiko]
See it's funny cause I never thought this would end, but then the season changed
[Drake]
You were my, You were my, You were my love
Shoulda made, Shoulda made, you my world
Shoula did everything to make you happy baby
Oh yeah
[Jhene Aiko]
Can't wait for, Can't wait for, Can't wait for springtime
And I will turn into a butterfly
I will spread my wings and Fly......
And I'm too fly for this shit
Ohhhha wooooh...
I am japanese if you please
