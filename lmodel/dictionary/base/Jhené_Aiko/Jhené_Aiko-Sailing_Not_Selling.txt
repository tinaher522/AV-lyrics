<song artist="JhenÃ©_Aiko" title="Sailing_Not_Selling">
See, I got a lot to say and I ain't afraid to say it
Mind on my money so that's why I'm trying to make it
Yeah, but the money's what you make it
Let it make you, see where it's gon' take ya
Hey, you'll be headed nowhere, moving so fast you won't even care, yeah
But when you get there, what you gon' do when nobody's there?
Hey, I know what you're gonna say, made it there alone so you don't worry 'bout they, hey
But when it all goes away, you're gonna be stuck, so what I'm trying say is
Don't lose your so-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oul
Oh-oh, let go-oh, let go of your ego
Don't sell your so-oh-oul, sail your so-oul
Sailing so-oh-oul, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Isn't it clear that you are only hurting yourself?
You will never grow if you lose control over yourself
(Don't let go) If you don't get a hold of yourself
Then you will end up with no self
Playing the game for the fame in the end
But what do you gain when you're paying to win
You don't, you better keep your soul
Set sail or get sold, oh
[Kanye West]
I sold my soul to the devil, that's a crappy deal
Least it came with a few toys like the Happy Meal
This game, you could never win
'Cause they love you, then they hate you, then they love you again
Get away from me loneliness, get away from me misery
Get away from me fake shit, I can't take the phoniness,
Get away from me wack tracks, I can only make only hits
I'm an only child lost in the world, where did the lonely kids go when the bell ring?
And feeling like hell rings, bringing me back down, checking my background, it's ironic what's happening
Imagine if I didn't have the ends, I wouldn't have so many imaginary friends
I'm spaced out dog, I be on that moon talk, wonder if God asked Mike how to moon walk
I swear to mom, I wish me and my father talk more
I stopped visiting around the time I was a sophomore
I guess everything I hate about me I see in him
And I ain't finna change, so we'll never agree again
Just a few things pouring out my soul, Rosewood we could see out with our eyes closed
Don't lose your so-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oul
Oh-oh, let go-oh, let go of your ego
Don't sell your so-oh-oul, sail your so-oul
Sailing so-oh-oul, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
