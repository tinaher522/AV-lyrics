<song artist="JhenÃ©_Aiko" title="Everything">
When I had you, I had everything then you left and I had nothing cause you were everything
Tried to close my eyes last night, but I couldn't 
Cause I wanted you by my side
Tried to act as if I was so right, but I wasn't 
Cause I wanted you in my life
And I just can't go on, like nothing's wrong,
I need you baby, its driving me crazy
Cause when you left me you took a piece of me
Oh baby, baby, yeah, yeah
Chorus
I had everything when I had you,
Now I don't have a thing, cause I don't have you
I just can't live without you
Cause you are my everything
I lost everything when I lost you
Inside I'm dying, cause now I need you
I just can't breathe without you
Cause you are my everything

It's like my heart don't beat no more
Cause you are the blood in my veins
And I just can't be straight no more
Cause you are what kept me sane
You were my day, my night, my life
But you couldn't see
I want you back in my life
Cause you were my everything
Chorus
Bridge
The best thing in my life, my heart, my soul, my air, my sky
Now it's all gone, don't know what went wrong
Now life seems to be worthless, without you here I'm worthless
Why couldn't you have stayed cause you were everything
And without you, I'm nothing
Chorus
