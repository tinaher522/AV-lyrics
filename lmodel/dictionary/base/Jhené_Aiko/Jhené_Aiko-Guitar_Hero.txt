(Baby you look so good tonight) 
[Verse 1] 
Baby if you were a picture 
I'd be content to just be a caption 
You on display is my distraction 
Cause you're a work of art (and I can't wait to start) 
Painting me in your frame tonight (frame tonight) 
If you were a movie, 
I'd wanna be the plot that's written up (Camera's filming only us) 
And baby I'm a be your co-star 
Now come over and strum on my guitar 
[Hook] 
Lets Start with the G string 
Take your frustrations out on me 
(Strum it out, strum it out, strum it out) 
Oooh you need to take your fingers and rub 'em all through my strings 
(Strum it out, strum it out, strum it out) 
We can play in the key of Love, its all about us 
(Strum it out, strum it out, strum it out) 
Oooh my body's your instrument 
You can play a song all night long....... 
[Chorus] 
Be My Guitar Hero 
Play Me Like Lenny 
Strummin me legendary 
Play me like Jimmy 
Teach me a new song 
Boy I know plenty 
Play me Like A Rock Star 
Strummin On My Guitar 
Oooh it's gettin intense 
Make Me hear Doves Cry 
Play Me Like Prince 
(Strum) 
Now You playin me 
(Strum) 
So I guess I gotta sing 
(Strum) 
Get Down Get Down 
Guitar Hero Yeah 
[Verse 2] 
Hero Oh oh oh 
You're playing me like you're on a mission 
Singing your song is my addiction 
Cause you're a work of art 
And as soon as we started I knew we'd be 
Making a hit record 
I love your fingers 
Rubbin on me making me sing your name 
(making me sing your name) 
And baby I'm a be your rock star 
As long as you keep playin my guitar 
[Hook] 
Baby Play on My G String 
Take your frustrations out on me 
(Strum it out, strum it out, strum it out) 
You need to take your fingers and run 'em all through my strings 
(Strum it out, strum it out, strum it out) 
You can play in the key of love, it's all about us 
(Strum it out, strum it out, strum it out) 
Oooh my body's your instrument 
(Strum it out, strum it out, strum it out) 
You can play a song all night long. 
[Chorus] 
Be My Guitar Hero 
Play Me Like Lenny 
Strummin me legendary 
Play me like Jimmy 
Teach me a new song 
Boy I know plenty 
Play me Like A Rock Star 
Strummin On My Guitar 
Oooh it's gettin intense 
Make Me hear Doves Cry 
Play Me Like Prince

Strum it out strum it out 
Play on my strings now 
Ooh strum it out strum it out 
You're working me hard 
Ooh my body's your instrument 
You can play a song all night long 
Be my Guitar Hero 
Play me like Lenny

Play me like Jimmy

Boy I know Plenty

Play Me Like A Rock Star 
Strummin on My Guitar 
Ou ou It's getting intense 
Make me hear Prince 
[Repeat Chorus]
