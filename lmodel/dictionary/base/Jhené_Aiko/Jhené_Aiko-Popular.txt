<song artist="JhenÃ©_Aiko" title="Popular">
I was the young girl,
I was the dumb girl,
I was the one who can never be your one girl!
You were the fly guy,
Never asked why guy
Running around, making all of the girls cry, guy!
Layin in your bed is gets so cold,
You wonder why!
You were such da man 
Damn what happend
It's just so sad!
Chorus:
They say mister popular
Why are you alone now?
Mister popular, where are all your hoes now?
Mister popular why are you alone now?
Where did they all go now?
Mister popular, where did they go now,
Why are you so lonely now?
Damn, homie, 
In high school you were the man homie
The fuck happen to you
(repeat)
He wanted things that he didn't need
And I was the one who was trying to make him see
That he had it all cause he had my all,
But he's a lost cause,
Guess she cannot save them all!
Now he's at my show
Standing front row,
He don't know how
He messed up such a good thing
Look who's popular now!
Chorus:
They say mister popular
Why are you alone now?
Mister popular, where are all your hoes now?
Mister popular why are you alone now?
Where did they all go now?
Mister popular, where did they go now,
Why are you so lonely now?
Damn, homie, 
In high school you were the man homie
The fuck happen to you
( Repeat 5x)
