<song artist="JhenÃ©_Aiko" title="Limbo_Limbo_Limbo">
She was born in limbo
With the need to be as simple
As her makers and the made up things she dreamed
Falling from high buildings 
'Til she was numb to the feeling really
She would never be quite what she seemed
She was just as hollow as a
Earth opened up
Swallowing her
Off the grid and into paradise, her whole life
On a ride, her whole life was on a ride
On a ride, life was on a ride
Sailing through the cosmic seas
Her celestial frequency was needed
To fulfill the prophecy
She was too real to believe in
Though if they would, she could free them
From the truth 
That they've been told a lie
Their whole life
On a ride
Your whole life was on a ride
On a ride
Life is on a ride
Your whole life is on a ride
Your whole life is on a ride
Your whole life is on a ride
Always wondered why
Use to be so different 
You were not this type of guy
Always set aside all your extra pride
Then you started trippin' 
Different bitches on the side
Yeah 
And I am not surprised
No, I am not surprised
You always demand things that I could not supply
And I could not survive
If you don't have survival 
Then I cannot take that ride
Your whole life is on a ride
Your whole life is on a ride
She was just as basic 
As the universal language of love
Necessary to keep him alive
