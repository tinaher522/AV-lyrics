<song artist="JhenÃ©_Aiko" title="W.A.Y.S.">
At 44 minutes to 4
An angel walked up to my door
Opened the windows to my soul
Told me he thinks that I should know
That there's no slowing down
As the globe spins 'round and 'round
You gotta keep going
Gotta keep going
Gotta keep going
You gotta keep going
Gotta keep going
You gotta keep going
You gotta keep going
You gotta keep going
You gotta keep going
If there's one thing that I learned
While in those county lines
It's that everything takes time
You have gotta lose your pride
You have gotta lose your mind
Just to find your peace of mind
You have got to trust the signs
Everything will turn out fine
So why aren't you smiling? 
Why aren't you smiling?
Life can get wild 
When you caught in the whirlwind
Lost in the whirlwind
You're chasing the wind
You gotta understand
There's really no end
There's really no beginning
There's really no real
There's really no pretending
There's really no fail
There's really no winning
Cause nothing really is 
And everything really isn't
At 44 minutes to 4
An angel walked up to my door
Opened the windows to my soul
Told me he thinks that I should know
That life only gets harder 
But you gotta get stronger
This is for my brother
I do this for my daughter
That's why I keep going
That's why I keep going
That's why I keep going
That's why I keep going
I gotta keep going
I gotta keep going
I gotta keep going
I gotta keep going
Gotta keep going
Gotta keep going
I gotta show them that I can keep going
I gotta keep going
I gotta keep going
I gotta keep going
Why aren't you smiling? 
Why aren't you smiling?
Life can get wild 
When you caught in the whirlwind
Lost in the whirlwind
You're chasing the wind
You gotta understand
There's really no end
There's really no beginning
There's really no real
There's really no pretending
There's really no fail
There's really no winning
Cause nothing really is 
And everything really isn't
That's why I keep going
