Intro) 
My Oh My 
(Ohhh ohhh) 
(Myy Ohhh Myyy) 
My Oh My 
(My cherry pie) 
(OoooOoohh) 
My Oh My 
(Myy, Ohh My, Ohh My) 
My Oh My 
(Ohh) 
He's my cherry pie 
(1st verse) 
My friends say I'm trippin, 
Sleepin but they slippin, 
Somehow they missin, 
All that he's givin, 
I want him so bad, 
I'll never let go, 
I'll tell my girls leave me alone, 
They don't understand it, 
He's what I'm feelin, 
I just wanna hang out, 
That's what he be 'bout, 
No fakin, no frontin, 
He's what I'm wantin, 
He's just as sweet as a cherry pie. 
(Hook 2x) 
My Oh My, 
(My Ohh My) 
He's the apple of my eye, 
(OooOohh No) 
He's the only one that can make me smile, 
He's my cherry pie, 
(He's my cherry pie) 
(2nd verse) 
Baby boy be lookin bangin, 
I, I ain't playin, 
Lie, I can't be, 
He gives me what I need, 
Them boots with his hat back, 
So fly I gotta get that, 
I can't leave him alone, 
Pants just be saggin, 
Boy be lookin too good, 
I just wanna hang out, 
I just wanna kick it, 
I know that he feels me, 
He's just so real see, 
He's as sweet as a cherry pie. 
(Hook 2x) 
My cherry pie, 
Ohhhh no, 
My, Oh my, Oh my
