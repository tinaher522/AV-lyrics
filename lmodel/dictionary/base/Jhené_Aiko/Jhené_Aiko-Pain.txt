<song artist="JhenÃ©_Aiko" title="Pain">
Ooohhh oh baby baby 
How could you lead me all this way and then cause me so much pain...
Ooh Ah
(Verse 1:)
After all of the days and all of the nights that we had shared
I could have swore that you would never do me the way you did
And after all of the plans and memories that we had made
Never thought you were capable of causing me so much pain
(Hook:)
What was your reasoning why, Said you were in love with me why (Oh why)
I cried so many nights
I tried to justify your actions, but it just ain't happenin (No)
I need to know...Oh oh no
I can't believe...
(Chorus:)
I can't believe 
That you hurt me 
How could you say you love me like you say then cause such pain
Oh baby please can you tell me 
How could you lead me all this way and then cause me so much pain

(Verse 2:)
After all of the talks we had about marriage and having kids
It seemed unlikely to me that you would ever do something like this
And after all of those times I was there for you 
And all of those things that we been through
I hope she was worth it babe 
I really can't stand this pain 
(Hook:)
What was your reasoning why, Said you were in love with me why (Oh why)
I cried so many nights
I tried to justify your actions, but it just ain't happenin (No)
I need to know 
Where do we go
(Chorus:)
I can't believe 
That you hurt me 
How could you say you love me like you say then cause such pain
Oh baby please can you tell me 
How could you lead me all this way and then cause me so much pain
