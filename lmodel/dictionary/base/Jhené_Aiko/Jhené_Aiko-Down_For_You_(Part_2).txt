(Intro Hook)
I'll be down 4 u baby
I'ma ride for u baby
I will be the one u need
I'll do anything u want me to
(Lil' Fizz Rap)
Sexy abs, with your hips to match
Apple bottom jeans wit your lil Gucci backpack
Don't stand there, admire my mac tac
Gift of gab, I never lacked that
In fact, when I whisper in your ears
I see your skin bump up 
And the hairs on your arms jump up
I get the same feeling girl when I'm by your side
And when we kiss girl our souls collide
I can provide whatever you need
Just holla girl
(1st Verse)
Know how you got me on the line
But I can't stop thinking all the time
Boy where u be
Wanna be around u constantly
Give me that
No can't stand to go feelin
Before I'm even out the door baby
I wanna keep you there with me
I'm that chick
What - no doubt
I'm that chick
Up or down
Don't even gotta say a thing

Cause I'll be down
(Hook)
I'll be down 4 u baby 
I'ma ride for u baby 
I will be the one u need 
Give u anything u want 
I'll be down 4 u baby 
I'ma ride for u baby 
I will be the one u need
I'll do anything u want me to
(2nd Verse)
Oow what u bet
I'll never let 
Nobody else ever think they could come between
What we got between u and me
Cause baby boo u got it like that
And ain't no way I'm holdin it back no
Cause now I got u 
And if feels good now to be with u
(B Verse)
(Hook)
(Lil Fizz Rap)
I ain't tryin to get in your drawers
I'm a gentleman, I open doors
I'm ready and willin to give u more
Than the dude u was with before
