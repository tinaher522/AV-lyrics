<song artist="JhenÃ©_Aiko" title="It's_Cool">
My escape from everything
Please say you'll be my nothing
And I will give you everything
Man, you are really something else
You caught me at an awful time
See I just lost my smile
And that is what you helped me find
Hadn't seen it in a while
And then you 
Came to save the day and I must say
I think you may have done some more
God damn you
Stay on my mind like all the time
So every night I end up at your door
Hope that's cool
Cause I'm really not trying to impose 
But I suppose that I'm supposed to be here
With you
With eyes as sad as mine 
I think you'll find
You need me just like I need you, yeah
But it's cool
We ain't gotta be nothing
It's true
I'd actually prefer it, yeah
It's on you, it's on you, it's on you
It's on you, it's on you, it's on you
It's on you, it's on you, it's on you
It's on you, cause I'm cool
And I'm not even gonna front
At first I was just tryna fuck
But you have got me so in love
So deep in love, so please be love
And I'm not even gonna lie
I wouldn't mind if we just lie
Together till the end of time
If that is fine with you
It's fine with me
Definitely love
Definitive love
Infinite love, yeah
I've been wrong before
But this time I am for sure
It's you
Something you did 
Made me feel it deep in my core
And it's cool
Think that we're up to something
But it's on you
It's on you, it's on you
It's on you, it's on you
It's on you
It's on you
It's on you
It's on you
It's on you 
Cause I'm cool with nothing, yeah
Cause even nothing is something
