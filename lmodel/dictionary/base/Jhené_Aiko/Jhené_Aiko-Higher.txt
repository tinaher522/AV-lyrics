<song artist="JhenÃ©_Aiko" title="Higher">
[Chorus]
I will get you higher.
My love will get you high.
[Verse 1]
Break me down roll me up boy.
I can be your pipe dream.
Make you feel alright do the right thing.
Set my soul on fire let me in and I will
Take you way up there yeah.
Put it in the air.
Blow me in the air.
[Chorus]
I will get you higher.
My love will get you high.
[Verse 2]
Take a hit of this and then...tell me how you feel.
[Tell me how good it feels.]
When you can't rid of it then..
Thats how you know its real.
I'm forreal. Oh i will.
[Hook]
Roll it up
Ro ro roll it up
[Roll it up]
Light it up.
[Light it up.]
Ohhh Whoaa.
Roll it up
Ro ro roll it up
Smoke it up til' you're high.
[Chorus]
I will get you higher.
My love will get you high.
[Verse 3]
No stems. No sticks.
No seeds...its
Just you and me
On this cloud
And we don't ever have to come down now.
We are so faded.
Going to places
Beyond the sun.
Love is the drug that gets me high.
[Hook]
Roll it up
Ro ro roll it up
[Roll it up]
Light it up.
[Light it up.]
Ohhh Whoaa.
Roll it up
Ro ro roll it up
Smoke it up til' you're high.
[Chorus]
I will get you higher.
[I will take you...my love will get you]
My love will get you high.
