<song artist="JhenÃ©_Aiko" title="Remember">
This is the saddest story 
I have ever heard
Call early in the morning when I got the word
She says that it's his son
He says not at all
Please miss me with the excuses
I am not involved
No, not at all
Calm down
You know my heart (you know my heart)
Can't take anymore, damn
Said this before (said this before)
Yeah
Do you remember
Do you remember you?
Do you remember
Do you remember who you were?
Do you remember who you were?
Do you remember
Do you remember who?
Do you remember
Do you remember who you were to me?
Cause I do
Tell all the homies 
That your the one to blame
And when you speak my name
I'd like you to explain the lies you told me
That's why I walked away
I never did complain
You never heard me say
"You's a suck ass, busta ass"
If they ask tell them that 
I ain't mad
I'm just sad it never worked out
Now you coming back
Second chance 
Fuck all that
You gave her what we had
And yet still 
There's no love loss here
Calm down
You know my heart (you know my heart)
Can't take anymore, damn
Said this before (said this before)
Yeah
Do you remember
Do you remember you?
Do you remember
Do you remember who you were?
Do you remember who you were?
Do you remember
Do you remember who?
Do you remember
Do you remember who you were to me?
Cause I do
Do you remember
Do you remember who
Do you remember
Do you remember who you were?
Do you remember
Do you remember who you were to me?
Cause I do
