(feat. Lite, H.O.P.E. &amp; Roosevelt)
(Lite)
Ciroc and lemonade mixed in my styrofoam
Tryna pinpoint the exact moment where I went wrong
Damn I'm wasted
And my mind is racin' and frankly my dear
I've gotten so tired of chasin'
And my life is so outta place and I can't make it fit
So my best solution is just to escape from it
So po' another drink
Gimme a pillow to
'cause I don't wanna think, girl I'd rather feel for you
What I feel
What I feel now
What is real
What is real now?
Am I still
Am I here now?
If I'm still
Will I feel now, what is real now? (x3)
I can't afford more problems
I don't have time to solve 'em
Thinkin' he smiles too often
I do not cry that often
I need to cry more often
Am I living or, dying or
Finding something worth fighting for?
I'm the only real I see
I'm the only real I see
What I feel
What I feel now
What is real
What is real now?
Am I still
Am I here now?
If I'm still
Will I feel now, what is real now? (x3)
(HOPE)
Good intentions, good intentions
Young old soul, these my hood admissions
Searchin' heaven's admissions
In these streets, we livin'
The young raising the younger
We hunger for ears to listen
But I come in peace with peace and hair grease
Waves like Catalina, problems you can't see
A soul full of problems
Eyes filled with glee
If you don't like bein' judged then you shouldn't judge me
(I'll never change)
What I feel
What I feel now
What is real
What is real now?
Am I still
Am I here now?
If I'm still
Will I feel now, what is real now? (x3)
(Roosevelt)
Wake me up if I'm dreamin' now
Get me outta this hazy cloud
Feelin' like I'm free fallin' down
But I'm never gon' hit the ground
Gone through way too many ups and downs
Breakin' free from these chains right now
Won't let nothin' else hold me down
Letting go of it all, it all, it all
What I feel
What I feel now
What is real
What is real now?
Am I still
Am I here now?
If I'm still
Will I feel now, what is real now? (x3)
