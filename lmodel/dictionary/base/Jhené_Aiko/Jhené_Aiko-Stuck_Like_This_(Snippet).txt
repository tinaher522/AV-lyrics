<song artist="JhenÃ©_Aiko" title="Stuck_Like_This_(Snippet)">
Unfortunately 
You and me could not be me more happy with each other its true
But I don't understand
When you met such nice guys so cold 
They start acting so funny
If had a dime or all of the times that I tried to call you
But you didn't answer the phone
I would be a rich girl
But noticing that you always stay on one
(chorus:)
Damn 
I just know what is it
That got me stuck like this, stuck like this, stuck like this 
Damn it feels like I'm dying
I just can't stop crying
What is it
That's got me stuck like this
