Ahh, Yea

(Verse #1 Omarion)
How'd you get ya jeans so low (and)
hanging on ya hips oh no (you)
walking by me nice and slow (you)
acting like you just dont know (that)
I've been watching all the time(you)
bending over blowing minds (you be)
dancing on me tryin' grind (but you)
dont be giving up your time
(Bridge Jhene)
Shorty whats up,I'm just saying
Wanna hook up, I aint playing
What cha gon do, I'm just waiting
think I'm acting up, hey
(Chorus)
She could claim and she play games
But I bet she couldnt hang (not wit me)
ooo she's a tease ooo
She be acting like she dont
but I know she really want (get wit me)
ooo she's a tease ooo
(Verse #2 Omarion)
(you be) always sitting on my lap

(then ya) mind as well forget the tapes
calling me wit all that talk (and ya)
working on that sexy walk (but if)

then you need to go leave it be
(Bridge Jhene)
Shorty whats up, Im just saying
Wanna hook up, I aint playing
What cha gon do, I'm just waiting

(Chorus)
She could claim and she play games 
but I know she couldnt hang (not wit me)

(Rap Romeo)
Stop it please 
You's a tease

forget about you girl you should do me
just let me touch not even cut
Girl I promise planters aint got nothing on my nutz
mess wit me you must have some kind of gutz
I'm not your normal dude
I'm one you can trust
there's gotta be a offer that you cant refuse
I'm told enough girl there's no way I can lose
When I got straight A's up in the pimp school
(Bridge Jhene)
Shorty whats up, I'm just saying
Wanna hook up, I aint playing
What cha gon do, I'm just waiting
think I'm acting up, hey
(Chorus)
She could claim and she play games
but I bet she wouldnt hang (not wit me)
ooo she's a tease ooo
She be acting like she dont 
when I know she really want (get wit me)
ooo she's a tease ooo
