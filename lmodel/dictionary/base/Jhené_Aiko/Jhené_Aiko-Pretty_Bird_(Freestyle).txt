Yes, this is all I have left in me
Said she had just 
Self-expressed herself to death
Now nothing's left
Nothingness
She finessed it
She the best
And I said
And I said
Pretty bird
And I said
Pretty bird, pretty bird
Pretty bird, pretty bird
Sounds so pretty when you cry
Pretty bird, pretty bird
Pretty bird, pretty bird
You're so pretty
But why I never see you fly?
Pretty bird, pretty bird
Pretty bird, pretty bird
Please don't die
Please don't die
Pretty bird
Pretty bird
I know you're hurting
Well, so am I
So am I
Pretty bird, pretty bird
Pretty bird, pretty bird
Please don't cry 
You can fly
And there's a blinding light inside of you
There's a blinding light inside of you
And they can not deny you
They can not deny you
Pretty bird
Pretty bird, pretty bird
Pretty bird, pretty bird
Pretty bird, pretty bird
Please don't die
Please don't die
Pretty bird, pretty bird
Pretty bird, pretty bird
Please don't die
Please don't die
Pretty bird, pretty bird
Pretty bird, pretty bird
Pretty bird, pretty bird
Sounds so pretty when you cry
Pretty bird, pretty bird 
I know your hurting
Well, so am I
Pretty bird, pretty bird, pretty bird
Pretty bird, pretty bird, pretty bird
Pretty bird, pretty bird, pretty bird
Please don't die
Please don't cry
Pretty bird, pretty bird
We need your life
We need your life
[Common:]
The city heard
The sounds of a pretty bird
Yelling from Slauson to 53rd
What happens if you holla and can't be heard?
For the birds and the drama
I paint these words
They say through the pain is how we learn
You landed on the window of pain
Simple and plain
It's hard for you to fly in the rain
The way love goes is not the way that it came
Come fly
Un-die
Be born again
I've seen the strongest of them be torn from men
Ripped apart 
And get put back together
Them the ones with the most beautiful feathers
Let's flock together
Rock together
Nirvana
A bird's persona to be free and honor
The sky
That's when you really most high
Unafraid of the unknown 
And now we know why
Pretty bird, pretty bird, pretty bird
Let me
