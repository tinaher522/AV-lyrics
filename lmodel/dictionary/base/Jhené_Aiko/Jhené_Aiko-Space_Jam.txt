<song artist="JhenÃ©_Aiko" title="Space_Jam">
I met him in outer space
He asked me what I was doing there
'Cause I looked out of place
I told him where I come from
I don't wanna go back
He said compared to where he's from
It can't be that bad
And he said yeah yeah
I asked him if I could get away with him
Go grab my bags and just run away with him
And he said
We come from two different worlds girl
You're just an earth girl
You can never understand the type
Of man I am
He told me where he comes from
That everyone has a gun they're always at war
I told him where I reside
My brother is dyin' and there is no cure
I got a baby to feed
I barely eat
I'm chasin a dream
He told me he could relate
It's so insane
And that's when I said
We come from two different worlds but
There's only one us
That could make things easier
And he said
You come from a different world girl
But I think I'm yours girl
Let's get lost tonight
And start our on world
Start our own world
Lost in our world
Start our own world
We come from two different worlds but
There's only one love
That could make things easier
