Okay, so you just
Go around breaking hearts 
Just to see what is inside
Go around stealing 'em
Feeding 'em to your pride
Did you ever stop and think that
I might really need that to stay alive?
I'm starting to believe that
You don't really see that
I had given you my life
Oh, yeah
But it's okay
I'm going to find my way
But as for you
I don't know what to say
If you don't learn
You'll never know a good thing
You'll never know a good thing
You will never know
You will never know
No good
Never know a good thing
You will never know
You will never kno
No good
Never know a good thing
You will never know
You will never know
No good
You will never know
You will never know
You will never know
No good
You will never know
Mr. Serial Lover
I wish your mother
Loved you like I could've
That way you would've known how to love a woman
Mr. Conditional Lover
I wish your father would've stayed
I wish you never promised things
That never did come true
But it's okay 
You're bound to find a way
Cause it will all come back around one day
If you don't learn 
You'll never know a good thing
You'll never know a good thing
You will never know
You will never know
No good
Never know a good thing
You will never know
You will never kno
No good
Never know a good thing
You will never know
You will never know
No good
You will never know
You will never know
You will never know
No good
You will never know
It's okay
You just don't know no better
You're better off being alone
Hope you find comfort 
In all of the lies that you told
You'll never get it
I get it
I'm here on my own
I'll be on my own
But it's okay
I'm going to find my way
But as for you
I cannot say the same
If you don't learn
You'll never know a good thing
You'll never know a good thing
You will never know
You will never know
No good
Never know a good thing
You will never know
You will never kno
No good
Never know a good thing
You will never know
You will never know
No good
You will never know
You will never know
You will never know
No good
You will never know
