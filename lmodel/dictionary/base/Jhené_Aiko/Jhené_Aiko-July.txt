<song artist="JhenÃ©_Aiko" title="July">
It was the summer time
You was mine
And I was yours
We were so high
You told me that you loved me
Wrote my name up in the sky
We could not be separated
Sunny days
Indigo nights
Swimming in the pool at the sire
Baby we belong together like mariah
But when all good things come to an end
(You had to change up the game)
Oh the weather is not the same
(Now there's only cloudy days)
I can't stand the rain
In July
There were fire works exploding
But now its getting colder
Leaves are turning colors
Why?
Its just not our season
The one and only reason
Baby oh, baby oh
The summer turned into fall
What do I do
To get over you?
Let the rain fall down on my heart
Let it cleanse the depths of my soul
Let the wind blow the dead leaves away
And there will be no more pain
Ooh I'm in the right place
I'll forget all about
July
There were fireworks exploding
But now it's getting colder
Leaves are turning colors
Why?
Its just not our season
The one and only reason
Baby oh, baby oh
The summer turned into fall
Oh girl, you know that
You were my
You were my
You were my girl
Shoulda made
Shoulda made
Shoulda made you my world
Should have done everything to keep you happy girl
I can't wait for
Ooh
I can't wait for
Ooooh
I can't wait
Ooh ooh
I can't wait for spring time
And I will turn into a butterfly
And I will spread my wings and fly
And I'm too fly for this shit, shit, shit
I am Japanese if you please
Dum dum dum dum
