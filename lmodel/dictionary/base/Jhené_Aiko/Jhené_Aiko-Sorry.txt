<song artist="JhenÃ©_Aiko" title="Sorry">
Oh no no no no no no no
How you thought that it's been a while
i do admit that you're still lookin fine
you seemed surprised when you looked at me
and you're wonderin why i look so happy
please forgive me if i ain't sad
cuz you left the best thing you had
i moved on and that is a fact
how'd you really expect me yah ah ah 
(Hook)
Did you think i'd lay down and cry 
cuz you said you didn't want to be with me
did you think i'd give up and I
i'm sorry baby
i'm sorry baby
did you think i'd lay down and cry
cuz you said you didn't want be with me
did you think i'd give up and I
i'm sorry baby
i'm sorry baby
Now you say that you want to be friends
should i let my guard down and let you in
sorry boo i can't get with back
i can't see myself goin back
when you left me i got strong
i got up and now i'm alone
no more cryin in my bed
no more playin with my head
(Hook)
So don't you dare and try to come back
cuz i'm leavin with me feelings intact
i walked through the door
a very long time ago
you won't ever hurt my feelings no more
you see fooled me once
and then it's on you what's a girl to do
but do it twice and i am considered the fool
baby sorry
baby sorry
baby sorry ohhh
sorry baby
(hook 2x)
