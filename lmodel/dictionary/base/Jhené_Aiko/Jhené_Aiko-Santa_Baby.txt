Santa baby (What)
Mmm
Santa baby
Mmm...
Santa baby, slip a sable under the tree, for me
Been an awful good girl
Santa baby, and hurry down the chimney tonight
Santa baby, a drop top C-L-K too, light blue.
I'll wait up for you dear
Santa baby, and hurry down the chimney tonight
Think of all the fun I've missed
Think of all the fellas that I haven't kissed
Next year I'll be oh so good
If you'd check off my Christmas list
Santa honey, I wanna yacht
And really that's not a lot
I've been an angel all year
Santa baby, and hurry down the chimney tonight.
Santa cutie, there's one thing that I really need, the deed.
To a plex of my hand 
Santa cutie, and hurry down the chimney tonight
Santa baby, fill my stocking with a rolex, and checks
Sign your 'X' on the line
Santa baby, and hurry down the chimney tonight
Come and trim my Christmas tree
With some decorations bought at Tiffany's
I really do believe in you
Let's see if you believe in me
Santa baby, forgot to mention one little thing, the ring
I don't mean on the phone
Santa baby, and hurry down the chimney tonight
Hurry down the chimney tonight
