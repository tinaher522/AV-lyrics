(feat. Kendrick Lamar &amp; H.O.P.E.)
Where are you going now?
Why are you slowing down?
Why, why, why?
Where are we going?
Why are we slowing down?
Where are you going?
We should be growing now!
Try and visualize how to get it right
But my vision's so blurry.
Trying to slow it down,
Take us to the ground
But were always in a hurry now!
And if I could make this world spin a little slower
Then I would, and we could grow a little closer!
I think we're getting closer!
Where are we going?
(Closer, closer, closer)
Why are we slowing?
We think we're getting closer!
Where are you going?
(Closer, closer, closer)
We should be growing now!
Where are we going?
(Closer, closer, closer)
We should be slowing down!
Where are we going?
(Closer, closer, closer)
We should be growing now!
So in conclusion,
Sometimes we lose focus,
Planning our whole demise
We're getting the big picture and making it the wallet size.
So to what's important in my life I apologize.
I hope to stay faithful, focused and sanctified.
We all get distracted,
The question is would you bounce back, or bounce backwards.
You wouldn't know how to act or would you take action,
That's just a part of life and if your visions impaired
You'll probably lose it all tonight!
What's going on Marvin, dearly departed?
Young Marta, Bar or Parker…
Upon them all upon mighty days,
But sweet alcoholic nights are feeling faraway.
Son can only skype with his Pop,
Stop!
He's only feeling love from his Mom.
Got rocks in my stomach
I can feel my soul bleed self love,
But I never want my son to be me, holla at me!
So I pray until I feel it's not working
I'm a showman on the surface,
Either way it's perfect,
You ever feel like the purpose ain't worth it
Well I do, I'm the poster child for young fathers working
I swear to god I wanna be free,
And he just wanna be me!
And I just wanna be him!
I'm jealous and discreetly
I'm one of your own!
I'm trying to raise a child,
Still trying to raise me right now!
Where am I gone?
Try and visualize how to get it right
But my visions are blurry.
Trying to slow it down,
Take us to the ground
We were always in a hurry now!
And if I could make this world spin a little slower
Then I would, and we could grow a little closer!
I think we're getting closer!
Where are we going?
Why?
Why are you going?
Why are we growing apart?
We should be growing together?
Right.
