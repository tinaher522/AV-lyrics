<song artist="JhenÃ©_Aiko" title="3:16_AM">
Out of place, out of space and time, wide awake
Out of papers i am, not okay
I am out my mind
Outer space, that's where i been goin'
To a place where, place where nobody knows
Floating at a pace where now you see me now and now you don't
I do not feel the fear of fallin, i wanna fly
If it all goes well then i will
But what if i don't?
Ill be right where i was before
But i'm not alone, you say take my hand
And we go (and we go), and we go (and we go)
And i hope that we don't overdose
Cause we don't (cause we don't)
No we don't (no we don't)
Ever know when we have had enough
Wait...
Now my thoughts so cloudy and my hearts so crowded with hate
I am so frustrated like my souls been taken away
Broken promise of everything that i thought you were
Thought you said this would never hurt, that's what it did that is all
I do not feel the fear of falling
Thought i could fly
It didn't go well but oh well
What do you know
I'm right back where i was before
But i'm not alone, you say take my hand
And we go (and we go), and we go (and we go)
And i hope that we don't overdose
Cause we don't (cause we don't)
No we don't (no we don't)
Ever know when we have had enough
I'm a be so cold, need some more
I've never felt these things before
I'm a feind for sure, please don't go
How could you not need me no more?
You're the only thing that i love
You're the only thing that i want
You're the only reason, the only reason
I do not feel the fear of fallin', i wanna fly
If it all goes well, then i will
But what if i don't?
Ill be right where i was before
But i'm not alone
You're all that i know
