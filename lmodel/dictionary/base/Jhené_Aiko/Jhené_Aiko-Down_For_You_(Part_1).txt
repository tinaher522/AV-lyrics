<song artist="JhenÃ©_Aiko" title="Down_For_You_(Part_1)">
*I'll be down for you baby
I'ma ride for you baby
I will be the one you need
I'll do anything you want me to
I'm the man that you'll ever need
Even if it get ugly I'll never leave, 
Trust me I'll never cheat
On the road for the lust, please never me
I heard a lot of girls but we will never see the day
I do you dirty
Keep it real you don't seem to do you heard me
We can even vacate the Aruma early
Wifey you qualify my mind,
'Cause you roll like me n I'm still like me
To daydream bout the sound
Show you parts of the world
You ain't seen as a child
We can show the world what a team is about
We could seem as a child
Are you feelin' me now
When as long as I know it who
We possess so long til the day is gone
Sing the song up in here, come on
If lovin' you ain't right, then there's 
A lot of wrong up in here, come on
*I'll be down for you baby
I'ma ride for you baby
I will be the one you need
Give you anything you want,
I'll be down for you baby
I'ma ride for you baby
I will be the one you need
I'll do anything you want me to
If you're behind every high kid as a high chick
Keep rollin' by cribs in the tropics
Been hard tops if she ain't a drop chick
Can she stay tough sell fame with the gossip
Ma that's why I called you up and went and hesitated
To do somethin' for you
I'll let you wake my sis up and you got your own k-boo
You may even like mine, wassup I mean
Start from the mean groupies, the limosines I needa
Wife that's for me to fulfill my every need and she go
Nobody to say keep it real and never cheat and we the 
Hardest pair and pact like Kobe &amp; Shaq.
She got me a jersey and she throwin' it back and 
I got love for my ma ain't no hole in that back
She got me openin' and I told a lotta girls i love them but
It feel good now just to know its a fact.
*I'll be down for you baby
I'ma ride for you baby
I will be the one you need
Give you anything you want,
I'll be down for you baby
I'ma ride for you baby
I will be the one you need
I'll do anything you want
Where would I be without you, to be without you
It feels like Ashanti, tryna ever be without you
I'd bleed without you, you my everything and 
I see the differences like G without you
'Cause my whole life has changed, believe that
Got me a wife so uh girl I dont need that,
Girls I don't need that like Mr. Hollister i'ma take care of home
'Cause that's where my queen's at
*I'll be down for you baby
I'ma ride for you baby
I will be the one you need
Give you anything you want,
I'll be down for you baby
I'ma ride for you baby
I will be the one you need
I'll do anything you want me to
