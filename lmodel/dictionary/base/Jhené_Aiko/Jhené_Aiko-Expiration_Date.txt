<song artist="JhenÃ©_Aiko" title="Expiration_Date">
It's an emergency
I needed you to come rescue my heart urgently
Oh, baby, but you never changed so the same things kept hurting me
Now I see perfectly what went wrong
Hey-ey-ey
Countless times I begged you to listen
Now you want me to think you got the message
I know I said it's over the last time that we broke up
But I'ma say it clear and loud
I bet you care and hear me now
The expiration date that I gave to you
Has now come and gone so I have to move
And that's when love stopped, died, and you know
It's too late for me to hold on
The expiration date is when our love fades away
It's so stupid to me
But I'm already over the shit that you did to me
But there's so many parts of our broken history
That I mentally erased from my mind
Hey-ey-ey
Countless times I begged you to listen
Now you want me to think you got the message
I know I said it's over the last time that we broke up
But I'ma say it clear and loud
I bet you care and hear me now
The expiration date that I gave to you
Has now come and gone so I have to move
And that's when love stopped, died, and you know
It's too late for me to hold on
The expiration date is when our love fades away
I said, I think it's kinda funny now
How you wanna hang around
How 'bout you get your shit and get out?
'Cause I don't want you around
When you had the change
You just couldn't manage
The time that we spent
You just took advantage of love
The expiration date that I gave to you
Has now come and gone so I have to move
And that's when love stopped, died, and you know
It's too late for me to hold on
The expiration date is when our love fades away
