<song artist="JhenÃ©_Aiko" title="Drowning">
This time I was sure/
I had found a boy/
I could give my world/
Be forever his girl/
But of course,
He left me just,
Like all the rest of them/
And now,
My world's crashin down,
Down, down, down/
Crashin all the way down/
Cuz he aint around,
Round, round, round/
He said he'd be around/
I'm just gunna,
Lay here and,
Drown In my,
Own tears,
I?m,
Drowning/
This time I was certain/
There'd be no more heartache/
I thought you were perfect/
Tell me was she worth it/
Now here I am again/
A broken heart to mend/
No one can help me now/
The walls are closing in/
And now,
My world's crashin down,
Down, down, down/
Crashin all the way down/
Cuz he aint around,
Round, round, oh../
He said he'd be around/
I'm just gunna/,
Stay here face,
Down in my,
Own tears,
I?m/
Drowning/
Drownin, 
Drownin/
