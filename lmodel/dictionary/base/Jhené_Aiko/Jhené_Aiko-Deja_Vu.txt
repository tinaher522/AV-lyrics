<song artist="JhenÃ©_Aiko" title="Deja_Vu">
Just when I had decided and told myself I didn't want nobody,
You appeared to me
Just when I decided love itself was just a made up story,
You made it real to me
Tell me what the chances are 
you, me together forever 
is something that I sware I've done before
(and I) won't let nothin' happen to this feelin, love and cuddle with me
is this what I was created for
Chorus: 
For internity I made my mind up
can't believe I finally found ya
my one true love
I'm livin DeJa Vu
You've been in my dreams so many times 
I can't believe this is my life now
your my true love 
I'm livin DeJa Vu
Although I've known you for years
it always feels like the first time I've seen you
when I open up my door 
I wish I could make time stand still to feel your arms around me baby 
maybe, for a minute or two more
When you look into my eyes,   
you make me feel like I'm the only person hear in the entire world
(and I) I know I may sound crazy 
but I think the world was made to bring you to me
I was meant to be your girl
For internity I made my mind up
can't believe I finally found ya
my one true love
I'm livin DeJa Vu
You've been in my dreams so many times 
I can't believe this is my life now
your my true love 
I'm livin DeJa Vu
oooo
Its crazy, its crazy
o, no
I'm livin DeJa Vu...oooooo
o, no no no no no no no 
For internity.......
For internity I made my mind up
can't believe I finally found ya
my one true love
I'm livin DeJa Vu 
You've been in my dreams so many times I 
can't believe this is my life now
your my true love 
I'm livin DeJa Vu (x2)
