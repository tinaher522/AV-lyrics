Chorus:
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
Memories sinkin', deep in, leakin' in my mine,
All of the time tried to forget you,
Thought I could get you to be mine.
Memories sinkin', deep in, leakin' in my mine,
All of the time I can't forget to,
Tried to forget you in my mine
Pretend to not have the patience,
Pretend that there is enough time for waiting,
Remembering when we kept it a basic,
I wanna go back so that I could taste it
What do I care for?
You were not there anymore
I was not careful,
That is all your fault,
You let me fall
Chorus:
Memories sinkin', deep in, leakin' in my mine,
All of the time tried to forget you,
Thought I could get you to be mine.
Memories sinkin', deep in, leakin' in my mine,
All of the time I can't forget to,
Tried to forget you in my mine
Buried alive inside a nightmare,
Living a life where you're gone,
There is no light here,
It will be light-years until my mind's clear.
I did it all for love,
I did it all
I'd trade it all for you
I'd trade it all
But what do I care for?
What are you here for?
If you're not there when I call?
I was not careful,
And that's all your fault,
You let me fall
Chorus:
Memories sinkin', deep in, leakin' in my mine,
All of the time tried to forget you,
Thought I could get you to be mine.
Memories sinkin', deep in, leakin' in my mine,
All of the time I can't forget to,
Tried to forget you in my mine
This ain't how it was supposed to be,
You and me supposed to be,
Remember when it be just me and you in your crib smoking trees
Like it's in control of me,
You had a hold on me,
Had me so gone baby,
Yeah, you had me giving me all of me
Now it's all over, it's all done
Shouldn't have told ya, you're the one
I'll be all right,
I will be just fine
I'll be OK,
Once you get out my mind
Chorus:
Memories sinkin', deep in, leakin' in my mine,
All of the time tried to forget you,
Thought I could get you to be mine.
Memories sinkin', deep in, leakin' in my mine,
All of the time I can't forget to,
Tried to forget you in my mine
