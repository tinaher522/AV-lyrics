<song artist="JhenÃ©_Aiko" title="Blue_Dream">
We were coastin' on the coast 
When you opened my eyes
Made me notice where the ocean was holding the sky
Right
I was blinded
Your smile shining 
Behind those green eyes
The horizon so enticing
Please, say you'll be mine
Don't wake me up 
Cause I'm in love with all that you are
You make me see the truth in things
I think that you are
The remedy for everything 
It seems that you are
The truth itself
Cause nothing else can take me so far
My afternoon dream 
When the world is speedin'
I am still sleepin'
In my blue dream and I know the meaning
For all the seasons
You are the reason
My love
My mind is open
So wide since you came inside
I feel so alive
Without you 
Life just passes by, passes by, passes by
Don't wake me up 
Cause I'm in love with all that you are
You make me see the truth in things
I think that you are
The remedy for everything 
It seems that you are
The truth itself
Cause nothing else can take me so far
My afternoon dream 
When the world is sleeping
I am still thinking of my blue dream
It's bliss
My afternoon dream 
When the world is sleeping
I am still thinking of my blue dream
It's bliss
Don't wake me up 
Cause I'm in love with all that you are
You make me see the truth in things
I think that you are
The remedy for everything 
It seems that you are
The truth itself
Cause nothing else can take me so far
My afternoon dream 
When the world is sleeping
I am still thinking of my blue dream
It's bliss
