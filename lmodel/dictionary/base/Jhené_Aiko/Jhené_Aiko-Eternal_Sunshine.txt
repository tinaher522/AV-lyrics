<song artist="JhenÃ©_Aiko" title="Eternal_Sunshine">
Is it strange for me to say that
If I were to die today
There's not a thing that I would change
I've lived well
Maybe I have made mistakes 
And been through my fair share of pain
But all in all
It's been okay
I've lived well
And the more that I see
The more that I know
I don't know anything
At all
Like the more that I breathe
And start to go slow
Of all the many things
I can only recall
All of the good things, good things
All of the good things, good things
Only the good, the good, the good
Only the good, the good, the good
All of the good things, good things
All of the good things, good things
Only the good, the good, the good
Only the good, the good, the good
Living on Sycamore street
And spending weekends on the beach
We were free to be everything we dreamed
Flying kites and water fights
Summer nights
We'd ride our bikes
On Over Hill
Ladera Heights
Man, I swear
And the more that I see
The more that I know
I don't know anything
At all
Like the more that I breathe
And start to go slow
Of all the many things
I can only recall
All of the good things, good things
All of the good things, good things
Only the good, the good, the good
Only the good, the good, the good
All of the good things, good things
All of the good things, good things
Only the good, the good, the good
Only the good, the good, the good
All of the good things, good things
All of the good things, good things
Only the good, the good, the good
Only the good, the good, the good
