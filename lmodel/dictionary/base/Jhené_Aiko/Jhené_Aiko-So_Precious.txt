<song artist="JhenÃ©_Aiko" title="So_Precious">
Lately you've been steeping out
On a game now
Bout to lose another good thing
I'm bona fide, you can't deny 
You know what you got what
See that Benz you copped
You know I'm just as hot
This little shorty made just for you
Cause this little shorty needs love too
Chorus
So Precious with them diamonds around your neck
So precious so, don't let met go
Ya cash flow or anything that you respect
So precious so, don't let me go
There's no limit to this jew so don't forget
I'm the seventh digit on your paycheck
I'm So precious, So Precious, precious
You know you want me, you know you feel me
Don't front now
Let me be the first t let 
That you ever cried
Pamper me with love the way 
You treat the car you drive
Respect the love, we had, we shared
Chorus
I'm not like them chicks that you had before
Im tired but a billion more
I know cash rules everything around you
So let me give you the world and be your precious boo
Chorus
