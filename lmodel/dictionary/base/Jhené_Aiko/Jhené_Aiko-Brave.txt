<song artist="JhenÃ©_Aiko" title="Brave">
Broken hearts are made for two
One for me and one for you
Tell me have you heard the news
We are now in love
So I guess that I should mention
That I am in no condition
To put you in this position
I might fuck this up
But what ever the case
You're my favorite mistake
More than happy to make you
If you decide to stay
Know there is no escape
There's no one here to save you
But you're so brave
Stone cold crazy for loving me
Yeah, I'm amazed
I hope you make it out alive
Please don't take my hand 
If you don't plan to take a stand 
And be a man who understands 
That I'm no walk in the park
All these scars on my heart
It's so dark here
But if you're a warrior
There's nothing to fear
Nothing to fear
But you're so brave
Stone cold crazy for loving me
Yeah, I'm amazed
I hope you make it out alive
