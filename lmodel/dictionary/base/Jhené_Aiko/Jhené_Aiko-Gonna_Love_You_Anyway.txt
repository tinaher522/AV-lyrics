<song artist="JhenÃ©_Aiko" title="Gonna_Love_You_Anyway">
No matter what they say
I'm gonna love you anyway
Mmmm...
Mmm......
Love you anyway
I've had a lot of hell tryin to explain to my daddy
How you make me feel and why I wanna be your lady (Mmm....)
But he ain't feelin me (No no)
He says the way you carry yourself is wack
Your hat to the back, you pants saggin, but I tell him
You just look like that
There's so many things about you he just can't see
But boy you know what
When I start to think about it
It's like so what
Go 'head and let him trip about it
No matter how they feel or what they may say
I'm gonna love you anyway (uh-huh)
And boy you know what
When they start to flip about it
It ain't enough
For me to ever be without ya
You best believe it when I tell you we straight
I'm gonna love you anyway
(Love you anyway)
Even my girls say you play too many games with my feelings
But they don't understand the way we be relatin
I can't make 'em see (oh no)
Even my momma say that you just a flirt
You like to twerk
They wanna try and judge ya without knowin you first
There ain't nothin we can do about it
We might as well forget about it
Like the story of an old forbidden love (forbidden love)
We're the only ones who understands this love (who understands this love)
And just like Romeo and Juliet
We will stand the test of time
Our love is blind
I wish they didn't wanna change my mind
But boy you know what
When I start to think about it
It's like so what
Go 'head and let him trip about it
No matter how they feel or what they may say (Oh no)
I'm gonna love you anyway (I'm gonna love you anyway)
And boy you know what
When they start to flip about it
It ain't enough
For me to ever be without ya
You best believe it when I tell you we straight
I'm gonna love you anyway
(Gonna love you anyway)
I know (I don't know)
I don't know how it makes you feel to know that
My folks don't want me to see you at all
It really don't make sense to me
Cause you and me reached destiny
I hope one day, we can laugh about it
Even though, they don't even want you to call
I guess its just you and me
Cause they gone be how they gone be yeah
But boy you know what (Ohhh.....)
When I start to think about it
It's like so what
Go 'head and let him trip about it
No matter how they feel or what they may say
I'm gonna love you anyway 
And boy you know what
When they start to flip about it
It ain't enough
For me to ever be without ya
You best believe it when I tell you we straight
I'm gonna love you anyway
(Love you anyway)
Yeah, yeah
Ohh
Love you anyway
I'm gonna love you (love you anyway)
Anyway (anyway)
Oh baby
I-I love you
Baby(baby)
(oh baby)
Believe me when I say we straight
I'm gonna love you anyway
But boy you know what 
When I start to think about it
It's like so what
Go 'head and let him trip about it
No matter how they feel or what they may say
I'm gonna love you anyway
And boy you know what
When they start to flip about it
It ain't enough
For me to ever be without ya
You best believe it when I tell you we straight
I'm gonna love you anyway
(Love you anyway)
But boy you know what (I......)
When I start to think about it
It's like so what
Go 'head and let him trip about it (Go head and let em trip about it)
No matter how they feel or what they may say
I'm gonna love you anyway (Gonna love you anyway)
And boy you know what (Ohhhh.......)
When they start to flip about it
It ain't enough
For me to ever be without ya (Oh yes I am oh yes I am)
You best believe it when I tell you we straight
I'm gonna love you anyway
(Love you anyway)
I'm gonna love you anyway, yeah 
Gonna Love You Anyway
