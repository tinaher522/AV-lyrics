(VERSE #1)
Who in da world is dis
Callin me at 2:26 in the morning
Crack of dawn and, got me yawnin
Why you tyin up my line
Sayin you apologize for all the lies you told me (lies)
Said you was chillin wit da homies (lies)
You was chasin all da shorties (dats right)
And now you clamin you adore me (you gets no)
(Chorus:)
You gets N-O-L-O-V-E from me

So get O-U-T my F-A-C-E baby outta sight outta mind

Now there's no more "whats mine is yours"
Cause I'm free now, I don't need you now,
Stack my cheese now
Sit on some D's now, wrists on freeze now
You can lie now

Say bye-bye now

No second try now

You wanna wanna be a playa playa go play
You wanna be a baller baller go ball

Baby you and me caint kick it no more
