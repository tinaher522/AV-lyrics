<song artist="JhenÃ©_Aiko" title="Don't_Walk_Away">
1st verse:
Now baby I know I was wrong,
would you please listen to me,
see I never meant to hurt you but,
I just had to go do me,
and he was just a part time love,
someone there to fill the space,
but trust me baby when I tell you that,
he could never take your place,
don't walk away
chorus:
(Baby don't walk away from me),
I need you baby,
(I need you here wit me),
I know I was wrong but I dont wanna move on),
('cause we been down for so long) so long,
don't you walk away from me,
(don't walk away from me)
2nd verse:
And it was so confusin 'cause,
likin him while I still love you,
I know this might sound contradictorin,
now you tellin me I gotta chose, 

so either way I lose,
he was never your substitute, I don't know why I risked losin, (why I risked losin),
you 'cause baby at the end of the day,
it's gon be you that I'm chosin don't walk away
(chorus)
3rd verse:
When I cry myself to sleep I'm thinkin bout you,
please don't leave me baby,
no baby don't walk away from me now oh oh, you're the only one I need in my life it's true,
please don't leave me baby,
don't walk away from me now,
I really wanna work it out baby,
baby don't walk away from me,
I need you here with me
(ad libs to chorus out)
I know I was wrong,
I don't wanna move on,
so wrong,
don't you walk away from me,
don't you walk away, don't you walk away,
don't you walk away, don't you walk away,
I need you baby
