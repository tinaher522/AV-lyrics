<song artist="JhenÃ©_Aiko" title="You_Vs_Them">
It's the wanting you, never getting you
Keeps me wanting you, missing you
Just to picture you is what gets me through
Fit for you, I was meant for you
What I was sent to do, meant to do
Wasn't meant for you
Hope I said that shit right
Cos' if I never had you
Then I could never lose you
Do you know what might happen,
If I decide to choose you
Then the world may just stop spinning
It may just well be the ending
Talking all about existence
Who knows
But I cannot see tomorrow
If you're not in my tomorrow
Uh oh
I'm tryna save the world
How can I when
You belong to me, I belong to them
Who do I give me to, who do I let win
You or the world
You or the world
Your light shines so bright it's like two stars collide and
We'll only survive if we fight it, don't fight it
Your light shines so bright it's like two stars collide and 
We'll only survive if we fight it, don't fight it
Yeah
Cause if I really have to
You know I would choose you
Do you know what would happen,
If I ever lose you
Then my heart would just stop beating
And my mind would just stop thinking
And my strengths would turn to weakness
You know
That I cannot see tomorrow
If you're not in my tomorrow
Uh oh
I've gotta save the world
How can I when
You belong to me but I belong to them
Who do I give me to, who do I let win
You or the world
You are my world
