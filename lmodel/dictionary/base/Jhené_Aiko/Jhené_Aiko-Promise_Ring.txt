<song artist="JhenÃ©_Aiko" title="Promise_Ring">
T.U.G....Jhene...one for the trucks
(Verse 1)
Sometimes i feel so unsure
thinking my baby don't love me no more
and that's when i get to trippin
accuse him of things that are all in my head
i don't want to feel insecure
but saying it ain't enough
show me what's up 
some kind of token of love
it don't have to cost that much
make me blush and slide one on my finger
(Chorus)
If you buy me a promise ring 
i'll give you my everythig
yes or no boy don't you say maybe
come be my baby and i'll be your girl
promise ring or Jacob watch
that's the way to win my heart
i'm hanging on and you're making me crazy
come be my baby and i'll be your girl
(Verse 2)
Lately i don't know the deal
i need something a young girl can feel
when it's not what it seems to a girl like me
it's the simple things that mean more than a house on a hill
you'll bring me peace of mind
with something that shines
i feel like forever your dime
check yes to love letter for one step better
so it feels like your forever mine baby
After my birthday 
the rose withers away
after Valentine 
sometimes your heart ain't mine
after Christmas
when every gift is unwrapped 
i still need a little more than that
(Chorus)
(Bridge)
Platinum, gold, or silver baby i don't really mind
cuz only love can make it shine
let's make this official
don't you think it's about time
for us to take it there be the perfect pair
cuz i wanna be by your side
(Chorus)
