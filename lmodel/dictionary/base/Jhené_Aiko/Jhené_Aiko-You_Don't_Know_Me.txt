You don't even
Platinum status
Jhene
You don't know me
you don't know me
yeaaaaaaaaaa no no no
(Jhene drop the vocals)
I tested you that you let me know
the other side of you
boy you had me fooled
got me twisted yo with the average girl
doin me like that you in another world
thought you were the kind to love and treat me right
boy I was wrong cought up in yo ghetto hype
tryin to play me out who you dealin with
it ain't me cuz you don't know me
(Chorus 2x)
Do you really think you know me
what do I look like a puppet on a string
what you think is so suddenly
you gon play me
what you don't know me
cuz I know me
I let you in my life 
you tried to pull me down
almost fell for it
but boy I need to quit
tell me what to do
i'll be on my year
see I been schooled to these fakin moves
better get it straight cuz I know the rules
so don't question me and try to run my base
it don't go that way
neva will go that way
trust me when I say you don't know me
(chorus 2x)
(Bridge)
I know you don't know me
tryna pull somethin on me
tryna play games on me
I know you don't know me
I know you don't know me
tryna pull somethin on me
tryna play games on me
I know you don't know me
(Chorus 6x)
