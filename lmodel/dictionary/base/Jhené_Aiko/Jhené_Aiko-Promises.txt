<song artist="JhenÃ©_Aiko" title="Promises">
I've been coming home late night
I've been sleeping past day light
I'm waking up you're not by my side
Baby, that ain't right
I wanna be there with you
I really do be missing you
Everything I do is for you
And I really do adore you
You're getting so big now
You're making me so proud cause
You are such a star
And you know that you are
So every single little moment
I can't be there to hold your hand
I need for you to know that
I need for you to know that
Anything should happen
Anything should happen
Cause anything could
If anything should happen
Know that you'll be alright
Know that you'll be alright
Just promise you'll be alright
Promise you'll be alright
If anything 
(Alright, promise I'll be alright)
(Promise I'll be alright, promise I'll be alright)
If anything should happen 
(Alright, promise I'll be alright)
(Promise I'll be alright, promise I'll be, promise I'll be, alright)
Swear that I can still feel you here
I just can't believe you're not here
I've been needing you
All I dream is you
Don't think I can make it
I don't think I can make it
But then I hear you say that
I bet not do nothing crazy
Cause Nami really needs you
And I would never leave you
Cause I am in the stars
And everywhere you are
And every single little moment
Every single bit of sunshine 
Just know that I am right by your side
Know that you are right by my side
So I'm gonna make you so proud
You don't ever have to worry 'bout me
No, you don't ever have to worry 'bout me
Promise I'll be alright
Promise I'll be alright
Wish that you were here now
I'm missing you right here 
But promise I'll be alright
Promise I'll be alright
Promise I'll be alright
Promise I'll be
Promise I'll be alright
Promise I'll be alright
Just know that I'll be alright
Know that I'll be alright
Know that I'll be
Know that I'll be alright
Alright
Alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright
Everything is alright
Everything's in your mind
Life is what you make it
Life is what you make it
And anything can happen
Anything can happen
But you just gotta get past it
You just gotta laugh at it
And anything can happen
You fall down get back up
And you better believe that 
Nothing holding me back
So everything is alright
Everything is alright
Everything is alright
Promise I'll be
Promise you'll be
Promise we'll be alright
