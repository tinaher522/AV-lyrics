<song artist="JhenÃ©_Aiko" title="Wading">
Picture me rolling 
Out in the open, baby I know 
That you would notice 
You have been hoping I wouldn't go 
Should I be wading? 
Should I be wading for you? 
Don't keep me waiting 
I will turn blue 
Picture me rolling 
Out in the open 
With some other man I know 
Thought you would notice 
And you were hoping 
Feelings wouldn't start to grow 
While I was wading 
While I was wading 
Wading for you 
I have been waiting 
I will be waiting 
Till I turn blue 
I am not perfect 
I would never let 
You think I was more than this 
As good as it gets 
I'll have one regret 
You're something I cannot miss 
I will be wading 
I will be wading 
For you 
I will be waiting 
I will be waiting 
Till I turn blue 
I am not perfect 
I would never let 
You think I was more than this 
As good as it gets 
I'll have one regret 
You're something I cannot miss 
I will be wading 
I will be wading 
For you 
I will be waiting 
I will be waiting 
Till I turn blue 
And I will do it 
I'll do it 
I'll prove it 
I've proved it 
I've proven my love 
Baby don't do it 
Don't do it 
Don't ruin 
What you in 
And you did, my love 
And I will do it 
I'll do it 
I'll prove it 
I've proved it 
I've proven my love 
Baby don't do it 
Don't do it 
Don't ruin 
What you in 
And you did, my love
