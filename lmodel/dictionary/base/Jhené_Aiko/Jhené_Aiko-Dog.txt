Bringin you the heat
You were playin games on me
I'm your new enemy
No,no
Now cause we'll never be
Jhene
your a dog
Why'd you go and do that
Know it didn't work
You were playin games on me
Your a dog
You thought I was in the dark (no,no never me)
Baby Boy, from the start (you were trippin)
I was askin questions to see if you was creeping for no reason (at all)
I am accusing you of cheatin no matter what your sayin
So irritating so baby stop playin
Dog, trying to run your game on me
you're a dog, thing you can cheat on me
you're a dog, boy ya know ya lost my trust 
you're a dog, and I know it's obvious
You're a dog
Dog, trying to run your game on me
you're a dog, thing you can cheat on me
you're a dog, boy ya know ya lost my trust 
you're a dog, and I know it's obvious
You're a dog
You were playin games on me
I'm your new enemy
I heard you say you were gunna push up on her
I play along boy you think I'm stupid
I'm on point, never miss a damn thing 
Fed up, but Jhene ain't falling 
Think I don't know, but she is my dog yeah
I got my friend on you, tellin her to call
You got guts 
Now I know that your a dog
Dog, trying to run your game on me
you're a dog, thing you can cheat on me
you're a dog, boy ya know ya lost my trust 
you're a dog, and I know it's obvious
Dog, trying to run your game on me
you're a dog, thing you can cheat on me
you're a dog, boy ya know ya lost my trust 
you're a dog, and I know it's obvious
You're a dog
(Lil Fizz)
I'm a D.O.G 
from the T.U.G
It's hard tryin to be F-I double Z
I'm the Jay-Z of my generation
So sick I'm every hospital's number one patient
Girl's be killin me with they fantasies
When I really wanted was the g t d's
Two minutes of conversation then ya outta control
I'm a D-O-G, ain't no changin me
You think I didn't know you (you were playin games on me)
(You could be doggin me)
Tryed to play me for a fool  (I'm your new enemy)
You barked up the wrong tree(the wrong tree)
And now ya turned into my enemy
I planned it all out
I tryed to test you
I guess it didn't work
I'm so, I'm so
Dog, trying to run your game on me
you're a dog, thing you can cheat on me
you're a dog, boy ya know ya lost my trust 
you're a dog, and I know it's obvious (i tryed to test you)
Dog, trying to run your game on me
you're a dog, thing you can cheat on me
you're a dog, boy ya know ya lost my trust (I'm so disapointed)
you're a dog, and I know it's obvious
You're a dog
Lil Fizz ya'll

You're a dog
You're a dog
