<song artist="JhenÃ©_Aiko" title="To_Love_&_Die">
I'm suited, I'm booted, I've been hit by cupid
I'm being recruited
I'm ready for more
I'm ready for war
Hold your position
Load up ammunition
I won't fail this mission
'Cause baby I'm yours
'Cause where I'm from
We live by the love
Die by the love
We live for the love
Die for the love
Yeah I live for your love
Die for your love
Love
Now many men
Many, many, many, many men
Wish death upon me
Have mercy on me
'Cause I'm just a prisoner of your army of one
But I'll fight till the death or until your heart is won
'Cause where I'm from
We live for the love
Die for the love
Yeah
We live by the love
Die by the love
Yeah
I live for your love
Die for your love
Love
Which side
This side
You should switch sides
I'm not acting like a bitch side by the way
You need to switch sides right away
Love side, hate side
Never in between
That's why we stand for
Y'all fall for anything
West side, west side, by the way
Live forever for love or you can die today
'Cause where I'm from
We live by the love
Die by the love
Oh yeah
Yeah
We live for the love
Die for the love
Yeah I live for your love
Die for your love
Love
