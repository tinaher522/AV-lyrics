<song artist="JhenÃ©_Aiko" title="Wait_No_More">
So here we are again
Boy, this always happens
I taint like we scared
But we know what happens
When things move to fast but should moving slow
And it makes me want you more
Ohhh, boy
I've been wanting this more than you know, boy
It's killing me but we should take it slow, boy
It'd be so much better if we wait till we cant wait no more (No more)
Wait no more
Boy, the love is there
So there's no need for rushing
You can come right here
But don't you start that touching
It'd be so much better if we let this build up
It's worth the wait for something bigger
Ohhh, boy
I've been wanting this more than you know, boy
It's killing me but we should take it slow, boy
It'd be so much better if we wait till we can't wait no more (No more)
Wait no more
Ohhh, boy
I've been wanting this more than you know, boy
It's killing me but we should take it slow, boy
It'd be so much better if we wait till we can't wait no more (No more)
Wait no more
Baby, we got time (We got time)
I'll be worth the wait(The wait)
We got the ingredients, just let 'em marinate
When the time is right
Promise you it'll be a night
That you won't forget the rest of your life
Ohhh, boy
I've been wanting this more than you know, boy
It's killing me but we should take it slow, boy
It'd be so much better if we wait till we can't wait no more (No more)
Wait no more
Ohhh, boy
I've been wanting this more than you know, boy
It's killing me but we should take it slow, boy
It'd be so much better if we wait till we can't wait no more (No more)
Wait no more
