<song artist="JhenÃ©_Aiko" title="Make_Believe">
Lately I've been thinking about just loving you
And all the things that we used to do
I'm wishing now we could have stayed together
Cause now I know I'll never find anyone better then you
And I'm knowing that you're moving on and stuff
Still finding myself missing you so much
One kiss, find myself dreaming about it
Please won't you think about it,
To make it better how 'bout we just
CHORUS
Make believe you and me are together again
Let's just pretend
Baby can we make believe
And go back to being more then just friends
Can we make believe you and me together again
Let's just pretend
That we're more than just friends
Let's make me believe that
We never said it's over just for one moment
Can we make believe

Baby I've been wishing things were still the same
Been missing how you used to say my name
And two way kisses oh I'm missing how
You used to tell me I was beautiful
If its just one day lets just say
You forget about your girl, I forget about my man
It's easy baby, let's make believe
CHORUS
Just close your eyes and forget about separating
Just on last kiss, I'm waiting, anticipating
And don't act like you would mind
Just one more time
Put her in the back of your mind
And make believe with me
CHORUS
