Ayee ayeee ayeee. ayee ayee. uh. uh. aye.
If i could do better..
Then you could better too.
But i don't want better
Cause it only gets better witchu!
[HOPE]
My gut told me "stay or leave."
Now thats a crazy way to start a verse ain't it?
UH. I got advice from both Jay and Steve.
My business need me focused this focus is what i need.
Baby we don't need to chop it up. Darling we need to cleav.
Instead of yelling fussing loud cussing in the street.
So grow the f**k up one time my baby please.
Know this pride is gon' kill us and yo friends don't feel us but..
[Jhene-Chorus]
If i could do better
Then you can do better too.
But i don't want better
Cause i'm only better with you. whoa.
If you could do better
Then i can do better too.
But i don't need better
It only gets better with you.
[Verse]
If i were your rib then you were my shoulder
I'll be your rock cause you were my boulder.
When we're together they can't stop both us.
[they can't stop both us. they they they cant stop both us.]
My only plans with you are
Spending my one life staying with you
The wrong that keeps me right and
The light that keeps me guided.
Ooh. whoa oh.
[Jhene-Chorus]
If i could do better
Then you can do better too.
But i don't want better
Cause i'm only better with you. whoa.
If you could do better
Then i can do better too.
But i don't need better
It only gets better with you.
[HOPE]
UH.
In a relationship she wants 3 things:
1. Eyes that wont cry.
2.Lips that won't lie.
3. Love that won't die.
[repeat 3 times]
[HOPE]
Look here..
Baby I want you more than anything
Believe this shit or not.
I'm your rock I'm your black knightbaby i'm ya Pac.
I'm ya Clyde you my Bonnie.
Murder Mami from the spot.
We gon make it through the rough patch
And make it to the top.
Baby see you my real future mother of my kids.
I know you gon forgive me for the dumb sh**t i did.
You know I'm gon forgive you for the dumb s**t YOU did.
One love. One heart. But you need new friends.
Take that witcha.
[Jhene-Chorus]
If i could do better
Then you can do better too.
But i don't want better
Cause i'm only better with you. whoa.
If you could do better
Then i can do better too.
But i don't need better
It only gets better with you.
[HOPE]
UH.
