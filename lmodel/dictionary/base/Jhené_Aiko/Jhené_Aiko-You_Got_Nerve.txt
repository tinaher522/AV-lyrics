Ooh, 
yeah yeah, 
ooh, 
ooooh
oh oh, 
uh, listen
Its kinda funny how some things turn out,
I look back on the love that was once me and you and it makes me wonder how, how I hooked up with u 
and we stayed down for so long 
when we knew we were wrong for each other, 
u look like u cant think back 
well let me take u back, uh
Now the way the story goes, 
u would lie u would cheat u would hide u would creep, 
even wit the girls I know, 
no shame in ur game as long as she was cool, 
then u were good to go, uh, 
don't u know, that u what u do it all comes back, 
u say u don't like that
CHORUS;
You've got nerve 
Flippin out, becuz u heard, 
that the word was I've been seein someone else, when u did it yourself, 
You've been busy runnin wild, now u wonder why,
U got hurt, u got nerve
Verse 2;
Lets go a little bit deeper in the story, 
u would lie to my face wit a straight face, 
little did u know ur boy told me,
Anywhere u went
Known any given date,
Misleadin mistreatin deceiving, 
now u cant believe it 
Cuz u see that ur game is so weak &amp;
that's why I beated 
CHORUS;

You've got nerve 
flippin out, becuz u heard, 
that the word was I've been seein someone else, when you did it yourself, 
You've been busy runnin wild, now u wonder why,
U got hurt, u got nerve
Hook;
When u look and see its over u will find, 
that u cant date no one but yourself, 
all the things u thought to do, 
I did to u 
don't be mad 
don't be mad, cuz if ur mad, u got
CHORUS;
You've got nerve 
Flippin out, becuz u heard, 
that the word was I've been seein someone else, when you did it yourself, 
You've been busy runnin wild, now u wonder why,
U got hurt, u got nerve
You've got nerve 
Flippin out, becuz u heard, 
that the word was I've been seein someone else, when you did it yourself, 
You've been busy runnin wild, now u wonder why,
U got hurt, u got nerve
You've got nerve 
Flippin out, becuz u heard, 
that the word was I've been seein someone else, when you did it yourself, 
You've been busy runnin wild, now u wonder why,
U got hurt, u got nerve
You've got nerve 
Flippin out, becuz u heard, 
that the word was I've been seein someone else, when you did it yourself, 
You've been busy runnin wild, now u wonder why,
U got hurt, u got nerve
