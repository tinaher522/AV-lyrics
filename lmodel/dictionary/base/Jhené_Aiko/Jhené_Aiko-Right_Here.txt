Yeahh yeahh yeah
Ohh oh oh oh yeahh
I will be right here
I will be right here
First Verse:
Every time you feel alone
And you need a friend
Somebody you can talk to
You think nobody cares
And you don't know what to do
I'll be the one who hears you
And I'll make this a promise
Baby you can count on me
Whatever you need
I'll never let you down
Chorus:
Just take your time
I'll take it slow
You know that I'll be here for you
Don't worry
Have no fear
I will always be right here 
I will be right here (Always be right here) 
I will be right here
Second Verse:
The way you make me laugh
The little things you do
Nobody can compare to you
When I can't find words to say
It hit me anyway
It's so amazing what your love can do 

Hook:
And I'll make this a promise
Baby you can count on me
Whatever you need
I'll never let you down
Chorus:
Just take your time
I'll take it slow
You know that I'll be here for you
Don't worry
Have no fear
I will always be right here (I will be right here)
Third Verse:
When they say nothings forever (Say nothings forever)
And everything good has an end
They only believe that 
'Cause they never had you for a friend (Never had you for a friend)
Chorus:
Just take your time
I'll take it slow
You know that I'll be here for you (I will be here for you)
Don't worry
Have no fear
I will always be right here
I will be right here (Always be right here)
I will be right here (Always be right here)
I will be right here
I will be right here (Always be right here)
I will be right here (Always be right here)
I will be right here (Always be right here)
