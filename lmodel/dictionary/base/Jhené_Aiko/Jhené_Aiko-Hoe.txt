<song artist="JhenÃ©_Aiko" title="Hoe">
I hope she don't think that I think that she's some kind of hoe cause I don't care that just let me know that she knows what she wants yeah
Baby I wont judge, now I'm sure that she knows she wants yeah
Had me at hello my name is
Choose him before he could say it
I can't help feeling like he need it, you know I'm usually shy
I be lying, I'm just trying not to come too strong but I am
I can't front I see potential and if he say so, I won't say no.
Ohh, don't be scared of my aggression
Ohh, just don't get the wrong impression.
Chorus:
I hope she don't think that I think that she's some kind of hoe
'cause I don't care that just let me know that she knows what she wants yeah
Baby I wont judge, now I'm sure that she knows she wants yeah
Hey girl say girl I ain't no time to play girl
Now I'ma touch her and tell her I want that, girl
Yeah they call me Gucci but I'ma buy you Louie
Yellow stones on my wrist remind me of a slushy
Girl so fine wanna ride me like a huffy
Ugly girls quiet, pretty girls ride
Country girls, city girls love to flaunt diamonds
Got her in the bed with the kids straight wildin
Took her to the club brought her three long islands
She from Rhode Island, Atlanta I reside in
Big black diamond bigger than a black razor
Asian, black, Caucasian
I'm blazin'
After all I just hope he don't think that I'm some kind of hoe
I don't know he just makes me feel like he knows what he wants yeah
I would take it slow, but he makes me feel like he knows what he wants yeah
I be on my bold shit, I be on some bold shit
I be on my own shit, he know he be needin it
&amp; He know that I want it, he know that I want
He, he know that I want it.
I be on my bold shit, I be on some bold shit
I be on my own shit, but I ain't on that bullshit
He know he be needin it, &amp; he know that I want it
He know that i want it, but I ain't on that hoe shit.
Ugly girls quiet, pretty girls ride
Ugly girls quiet, pretty girls ride
Ug-ugly girls quiet, pretty girls ride
Pretty girls ride, pretty, pretty girls ride.
Pretty girls ride.
