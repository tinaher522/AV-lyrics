[Verse 1:]
Yea yea, ah
Similar ways, similar game
Starting to feel the similar pain
Are you sure we haven't met before?
I know ya face, I know ya name
But I don't know you?
Isn't that crazy? isn't that crazy?
I think we may be
In a different book
On a different page
You said you are different
But you're the same
Stranger.
[Hook:]
I can not tell you,
How many there have been
That were just like you
I do not need you
Cause you're just like them.
[Chorus:]
I meet em' everyday...
They... seem to be the same.
Lame. okay?
I meet em' everyday...
(Ohhh ohhhh ohhhh ohhhh ohhhh)
They... seem to be the same.
It's strange.
Ah.
[Verse 2:]
Familiar time, familiar place
Starting to feel the familiar shame
Cause I know what you have come here for.
You know my name, you know my face,
But you don't know me? you must be crazy.
Or I must be crazy. or is it maybe...
I've been here times before and
I've said yes, meaning no but oh...
Alot of shit has changed. lot of shit has changed.
Lot of lot of shit has changed.
[Hook:]
Didn't I tell you what all the rest have done?
They were just like you, they have all tried to.
You're not the only one.
[Chorus:]
I meet em' everyday...
(Meet em' everyday meet em' everyday)
They...
Seem to be the same.
(They are all the same they are all the same)
Lame okay?
I meet em' everyday...
(Meet em' everyday meet em' everyday)
They... seem to be the same.
(They are all the same, they are all the same)
It's strange.
[Hook:]
I think we may be
In a different book
On a different page
You said you are different
But you're the same
Stranger.
