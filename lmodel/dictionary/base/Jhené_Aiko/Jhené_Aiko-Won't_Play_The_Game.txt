(Jhene intro (Talking))
I'm not tryna mess with yall today man
I know what yall gon try to do
Tryna hook me up with him 
And let me talk to him
Nah man I'm not... no
I don't wanna experiment and date around
You know I just want one guy
I'm not, I'm not with all of that
You know, meeting people
And testin' the waters
And stuff like that
No, I just, I just want to date one guy
And see where it goes from there
You know, yeah
There's no reason for me to do what you want me to (To)
That's the truth
Wanna chill by myself and its cool (Chill, cool)
Despite what you may think
Cause I say (Say)
When the time is right (Time is right)
The real thing will come into my life
And until then I'm so satisfied 
And happy with me, oh
Aint lookin' for nobody
Homies sayin' that I should (No)
I aint really searchin' 
Cause I know what I'm lookin' for
Nothing to figure out
Nothing to talk about (No)
I won't play the game
Don't wanna catch a show
With every hottie in the hood
I aint really stressin'
Cause I know what I need and more
Nothing to think about
Nothing to talk about
I won't play the game
You think I'm lonely and I'm hurtin'
Hopin' and searchin' for love (Hopin', for love)
But that just aint the case
When I'm home alone
Or chillin' with my friends
I do it at my own pace (Whoa)
Just cause you can't figure out (Figure out)
What real love is all about
Don't even think that's what I'm feelin' inside 
(Don't even think that's how I'm feelin' inside)
Cause I'm not tryna rush it
These tings take time

Aint lookin' for nobody
Homies sayin' that I should
I aint really searchin' 
Cause I know what I'm lookin' for (Lookin' for)
Nothing to figure out
Nothing to talk about
I won't play the game
Don't wanna catch a show (I don't wanna)
With every hottie in the hood
I aint really stressin' (I can't really stressin')
Cause I know what I need and more (Cause I know what I need and more)
Nothing to think about
Nothing to talk about
I won't play the game
You may think I'm crazy, maybe
But I got my mind made up (Up, it's true)
It's true
I'm not wasting my time
Trying to find (Trying to find)
What destiny has prepared for me (Has prepared for me)
So I don't wanna talk no more
No
Aint lookin' for nobody
Homies sayin' that I should (I ain't really searchin' cause I know)
I aint really searchin' 
Cause I know what I'm lookin' for
Nothing to figure out
Nothing to talk about (Oh no)
I won't play the game
Don't wanna catch a show
With every hottie in the hood
I aint really stressin' (I ain't really stressin')
Cause I know what I need and more (Cause I know what I need and more)
Nothing to think about (You can't get me to play the game)
Nothing to talk about
I won't play the game
Aint lookin for nobody
Homies sayin' that I should
I aint really searchin' 
Cause I know what I'm lookin for
Nothing to figure out
Nothing to talk about
I won't play the game (I won't play the game)
Don't wanna catch a show
With every hottie in the hood
I aint really stressin'
Cause I know what I need and more (I know what I need and more)
Nothing to think about
Nothing to talk about
I won't play the game
