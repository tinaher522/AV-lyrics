<song artist="Kygo" title="Stay">
Thought I could leave you 'cause I felt my heart numbing
It hit so deep, I closed my eyes and I just took off running
I turned around and saw the look on your face
So I stayed, stayed
But I don’t need you and you should know that, baby
It'd take a miracle for you to really try and change me
Then I felt sorry for the look on your face
So I stayed, stayed
So I stayed, stayed
So I stayed, stayed
You wanna leave her, don’t wanna hurt nobody
I don’t believe a single word you say, or that you’re sorry
Why can’t I say no to the look on your face
I just stay, stay
So I stayed, stayed
So I stayed, stayed
You push me away, push me away
But I always stay, I always stay, yeah
You push me away, push me away
But I always stay, I always stay, yeah
You push me away, push me away
But I always stay, I always stay, yeah
You push me away, push me away
But I always stay, I always stay
But will you, but will you, but will you
So I stayed, stayed
So I stayed, stayed
I stay, I stay
Oh why do I stay?
So I stayed, stayed
