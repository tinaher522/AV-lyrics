<song artist="Kygo" title="Nothing_Left">
Tell me that you need me
To help you find a way
Through all of this madness
Can I be your light of day?
Please, won't you believe me?
Even if you don't agree
Know that I am trying
To help us all break free
Oh, there'll be nothing left for no one, no
There'll be nothing left for no one
If you don't start living your life
Turn to one side with a blind eye
There'll be nothing left for no one
For no one
I'm saying that I'm sorry
For things I've said and done
But I don't want to be here
If I'm, I'm looking down a gun
Oh, there'll be nothing left for no one, no
There'll be nothing left for no one
If you don't start living your life
Turn to one side with a blind eye
There'll be nothing left for no one
For no one
