<song artist="Kygo" title="Oasis">
Tonight, I feel like I'm lost in the desert
But you're my oasis
You found my heart
Tonight, I feel like I'm lost in the desert
But you're my oasis
Yeah, you're my oasis
I am stuck in quicksand
And I am trying not to drown
Fell in deeper this time and I'm struggling to get out
And doubt creeps into my soul
And now, I've found there's nothing left to hold
Tonight, I feel like I'm lost in the desert
But you're my oasis
Yeah, you're my oasis
I thought I'd die
I had no fight, I had given up
Thought I was done, I was savaged by the sun
I thought I'd die
I had no fight, I had turned to dust
When I came to in your arms I knew I would make it through
Tonight, I feel like I'm lost in the desert
But you're my oasis
You found my heart
Tonight I feel like I'm lost in the desert
But you're my oasis
(You found my heart)
Yeah, you're my oasis
Oasis
