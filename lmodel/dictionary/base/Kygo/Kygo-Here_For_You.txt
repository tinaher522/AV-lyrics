<song artist="Kygo" title="Here_For_You">
We'll be passing by, and they'll be wasting time
Just waiting for new
And while they're chasing darks, we'll be dancing in the dusk
Guess a way we're coming through
Whenever you need me I'm behind
I promise to take you off to the highs
When you feel you burning up
And you're wasted all your luck
I'll be here for you, here for you
When the dark is at its bone
And you run away from hope
I'll be here for you, here for you
I'm here for you
I'm here for you, you, you
I'm here for you, you, you
And while they're on the ground, we'll be looking down 'cause we found the truth
And the fire in our hearts will be blowing up the stars
Now we're coming through
Whenever you're feeling down inside
I promise to take you off to the highs
I'm here for you
And when you feel you've had enough
And you've wasted all your love
I'll be here for you
I'm here for you
I'm here for you, you, you
I'm here for you
I'm here for you, you, you
