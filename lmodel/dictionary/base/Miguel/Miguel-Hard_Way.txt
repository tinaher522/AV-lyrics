<song artist="Miguel" title="Hard_Way">
yo 
got me 
it's got me feelin like 
it's got me feelin like 
like 
(oh oh oh oh oh oh oh)
(oh oh oh oh oh)
(Verse)
I touched the guilt in your eyes
as your lips begin to lie
and it kills me every time
but i always learn the hard way (with you)
just be cool 
be kind
don't be dumb
don't be blind
it's the sweetness in your smile
its nothing new
nothing new
(Chorus)
but i always learn the hard way
and it always ends in heartbreak
you put me in a hard place
im always in a hard way
my heartbreaks with you
(oh oh oh oh oh oh oh)
(oh oh oh oh oh)
(verse)
i don't cry
i don't complain
there's a pattern
to this pain 
just keep hopin'
that could change
but i always learn the hard way with you
let's just face it
i'm complacent 
i'm just comfortable
yes im jaded
and it's all my fault
cuz i know what to expect so it's cool
nothing new
(Chorus)
swear i always learn the hard way (ahh)
and it always ends in heartbreak (ooo)
you put me in a hard place (ahh)
i'm always in a hard way (ooo)
my heartbreaks with you
(oh oh oh oh oh oh oh)
(oh oh oh oh oh)
(breakdown)
apologies
and promises
our empty words
same ol' (echoes)
yesterday
we were on
and you were here
but now your gone
(Chorus)
swear i always learn the hard way (ahh)
and it always ends in heartbreak (ooo)
you put me in a hard place (ahh)
i'm always in a hard way (ooo)
my heartbreaks with you
(oh oh oh oh oh oh oh)
(oh oh oh oh oh)
(oh oh oh oh oh oh oh)
(oh oh oh oh oh)
