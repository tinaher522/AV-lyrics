<song artist="Miguel" title="Girls_Like_You">
[Chorus]
Girls like you remind me that I'm lonely 
Yeaaah 
Remind me that I'm lonely 
No one to play Connect 4 with me
I Declare War with me
Knock out the snore from rolling around in my bed 
[Verse 1]
Someone, anyone to listen 
I feel like I'm missing the real thing 
Tell me where I go 
Girl I got a few
I can always call when I'm ready 
But I feel like I'm wasting my time. 
Yeah
[Pre-chorus] 
'Cause my heart beats are empty 
So once in awhile... 
[Chorus]
Girls like you remind me that I'm lonely 
Yeaaah 
Remind me that I'm lonely 
No one to play Connect 4 with me
I Declare War with me
Knock out the snore from rolling around in my bed 
[Verse 2]
I don't wanna think, I just wanna drink 
Cause I'm overcomed by this notion
Don't you know I'm real, baby can't you tell
But you got a hole in your heart 
I probably would dismiss it
The truth that I miss you for real 
Hook up something new?
Till I see a girl like you 
[Pre-chorus] 
'Cause my heart beats are empty 
So once in awhile... 
[Chorus]
Girls like you remind me that I'm lonely 
Yeaaah 
Remind me that I'm lonely 
No one to play Connect 4 with me
I Declare War with me
Knock out the snore from rolling around in my bed 
[Bridge]
Beautiful girls 
Intelligent girls 
Collate girls 
I hate ya 
(Yeah I hate ya) 
But the truth is I want ya 
And I need ya 
What's the very best way to reach yaÂ ?
I research ya?
'Cause I'm looking for something real 
[Pre-chorus] 
'Cause my heart beats are empty 
So once in awhile... 
[Chorus]
Girls like you remind me that I'm lonely 
Yeaaah 
Remind me that I'm lonely 
No one to play Connect 4 with me
I Declare War with me
Knock out the snore from rolling around in my bed
