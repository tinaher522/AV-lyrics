<song artist="Miguel" title="Waves">
Uh set it up, whilin', runnin', drop it
Baby drop it like your stalling, stalling tonight
I wanna ride that wave
Body built for the beach, do you got that ocean?
Body surf, don't sleep, body surf on me
Don't stop, I wanna ride that wave
All night, I'm gonna ride that wave
Look here, I'm gonna surf in it baby
I'm getting turnt in it baby
Putting work in it baby
Keep working it while I ride that wave
Put it out, I'm on fire, fire
That's what I'm about, take me higher, higher, tonight
(I'm gonna ride that wave)
You got everybody movin' for the beach
Do you got that ocean?
Your body surf, don't sleep, body surf on me, woman
Don't stop, I'm gonna ride that wave
All night, I'm gonna ride that wave
Look here, I'm gonna surf in it baby
I'm getting turnt in it baby
Putting work in it baby
Keep working it while I ride that wave
Bet you turn up when I pipe down
I'ma get it 'til I wipe out
Bully that thing, baby lights out
I'm gonna ride that wave
Let it crash down on me
Let it splash down on me
Body surf, don't sleep, until I hit the peak
Yeah, get wild baby, so hot, God damn, I need a towel baby
I could wipe you down right now baby
I could ride that wave right now baby, say
Yeah, get wild baby, so hot, God damn, I need a towel baby
I could wipe you down right now baby
I could ride that wave right now baby
Yeah, get wild baby, so hot, God damn, I need a towel baby
I could wipe you down right now baby
I could ride that wave right now baby
Yeah, get wild baby, so hot, God damn, I need a towel baby
I could wipe you down right now baby
Let me ride that wave right now baby
Don't stop, I wanna ride that wave
All night, I'm gonna ride that wave
Look here, I'm gonna surf in it baby
I'm getting turnt in it baby
Putting work in it baby
Keep working it while I ride that wave
