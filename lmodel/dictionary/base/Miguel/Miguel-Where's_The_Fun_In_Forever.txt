Where's the fun in forever?
Soon or later, she on top
If we only knew beginning
No end in sight to feel the love
Where's the fun in forever?
Would you love so hard?
We're just tryin' to be better
'Cause we have come this far
Have you ever stopped to think about how it would be anyway?
Tomorrow's just a day away, yeah
Tomorrow's just a day away
Tomorrow's just a day away
Oh, tomorrow's just a day away
Oh, tomorrow is a promise
Where's the fun in forever? Celebrate
Where's the meaning in tomorrow?
Where's the rush? Where's the angst?
Never feel it 'til tomorrow
'Cause it's all the same, ooh
It's kinda sad to think about the way that it would be
Thank goodness that
Tomorrow's just a day away, yeah
Tomorrow's just a day away
Tomorrow's just a day away
Tomorrow's just a day away
Tomorrow is a promise
Where's the fun in forever? Celebrate
Tomorrow's just a day away, yeah
Tomorrow's just a day away
Tomorrow's just a day away
Tomorrow's just a day away
Tomorrow is a promise
Where's the fun in forever? Gotta celebrate
Where's the fun in forever?
Gotta live it like the last day
Got to toast for the moment
Celebrate, celebrate
Celebrate, celebrate
Celebrate, celebrate
Celebrate, celebrate
It's a crazy thought to think about how it would be
Thank goodness that
Tomorrow's just a day away, yeah
Tomorrow's just a day away
Oh, tomorrow's just a day away, now
Tomorrow's just a day away
Tomorrow is a promise
Where's the fun in forever? Celebrate
