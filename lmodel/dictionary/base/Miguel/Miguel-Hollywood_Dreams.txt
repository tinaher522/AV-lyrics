<song artist="Miguel" title="Hollywood_Dreams">
Lost angel with an urge of subtle
Jaded eyes, and this empty fixation
Sweet hollywood sign, you're my salvation
Cokey scenes full of pipe dreams
Palm trees and a numb sensation
Chasing, uh-huh
Vivid schemes, put my name on a marquee
Still waiting for my big break, for fame sake
And we could be better than heroes baby, alright
We could fly higher than spaceships baby, all night
Said could you ever find the magic man
He can make it all happen, alright
Lost hollywood dreams
Lost hollywood dreams
Said wow, up fame, became your religion woman
Unique as you are your faith is coming
Now the walk of shame woman, it's reputation
Cheap thrills, fake friends, coke binge, what a numb sensation
Then he said, "honey I can put your face on the big screen
Well aren't you looking for your big break?
Come here, for fame sake"
And we could be better than heroes baby, alright
We could fly higher than spaceships baby, all night
Girl yopu're looking at the magic man
I can make it all happen, alright
Lost hollywood dreams
Lost hollywood dreams
Up and down hollywood sunset
Up and down
Lost hollywood dreams
