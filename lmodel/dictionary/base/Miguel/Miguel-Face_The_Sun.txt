<song artist="Miguel" title="Face_The_Sun">
I ain't a saint, I think you know
But I see the way I'm gonna go
It's no debate that I belong with youuuu
Baby, we're the same, you know my flaws
So if I ever strain, you know the code
But no matter what I do,
I know, I know I belong with youuuu
I belong with youuu,
Yeah, baby
Yeah, I got a temper, but I'm just sayin'
You pushin' buttons just 'cause you can
You know I hate it, but I belong with youuuu, oh!
But when I'm gone, I think you do,
You shouldn't worry 'bout someone new
'Cause no matter where I go,
You know I know I belong with youuu
I belong with youuu,
Oh, baby, I belong with you
You left right a woman, oh
'Cause when it's time to face the sun
I know that you're the only one, only one
Oh, yeah, baby, I belong with youuu,
Ye-ye yeah, I belong with youuu,
I bet a dollar 'cause when it's time to face the sun,
I know that you're the only one, the only one, yeah
Forever, baby, oh,
(I belong to you)
The only one, yeah, you're the only one
(I belong to you)
Yeah, I belong to you, baby
(I belong to you)
Oh, we can face the sun, let's fall into forever, yeah
When it's said and done, you're the only one, uuh uh uh uuh
I belong with youuu, oh, youuuu-uh uh,
I belong with youuu, oh, baby
Oh, and when it's time to face the sun,
I know that you're the only, you're the only one
I know that you're the only,
You're the only one,
You-uh uh uuh you-uh uh uuh
Oh, 'cause when it's time to face the sun,
I know that you're the only one, only one
