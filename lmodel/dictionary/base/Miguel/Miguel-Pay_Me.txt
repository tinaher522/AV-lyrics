Gimme pound gimme pound gimme euro gimme yen 
Gimme pound gimme pound gimme euro gimme yen 
I'm international baby

Gimme pound gimme pound gimme euro gimme yen 
Gimme pound gimme pound gimme euro gimme yen 
I'm international baby

I'm international pay me, pay me
I bet you like to pretend (that your just a tease) 
She said now and again (but tonight I'm aiming to please) 
I can love you long long time (but my love is coming with fees) 
I said come on girl quite playing (you know your coming with me) 
And when the music bash my heart beatin faster 
Until she turned, tugged on my shirt so I followed 
To a black room; were she at? 
Oh, she's there in a stance then she held out her hand and said 
Gimme pound gimme pound gimme euro gimme yen 
Gimme pound gimme pound gimme euro gimme yen 
I'm international baby
I'm international baby
I'm international baby
I'm international pay me 
Gimme pound gimme pound gimme euro gimme yen 
Gimme pound gimme pound gimme euro gimme yen 
I'm international baby
I'm international baby
I'm international baby
I'm international pay me, pay me
Electric red leather boots, worked up to her thighs 
Undid a zipper or two and she gave me a smile 
I ain't a fein or a fool but I guess I'm caught in desire 
Never did this before but I'm ready to go 
And when the music bash my heart beating faster 
Until she turned, tugged on my shirt so I followed 
To a black room; were she at? 
Oh, she's there in a stance then she held out her hand and said 
Gimme pound gimme pound gimme euro gimme yen 
Gimme pound gimme pound gimme euro gimme yen 
I'm international baby
I'm international baby
I'm international baby
I'm international pay me 
Gimme pound gimme pound gimme euro gimme yen 
Gimme pound gimme pound gimme euro gimme yen 
I'm international baby
I'm international baby
I'm international baby
I'm international pay me, pay me
Gimme pound gimme pound gimme euro gimme yen 
Gimme pound gimme pound gimme euro gimme yen
Gimme pound gimme pound gimme euro gimme yen
I'm international baby 
I'm International pay me 
Umm, do you take check
