<song artist="Miguel" title="Don't_Look_Back">
If I (if I), don’t make it back before the sun (the sun)
All you have to do is run (run)
Just promise me you'll run (run)
And don’t look back
Don’t look back
Don’t look back
Don’t look back
And promise me you run
I feel the night approaching
The moon calling me
Reluctant eyes have witnessed
The horrors I can be
I felt compelled to warn you
I'm not all that I seem
And though I care about you
The night is calling me
If I (if I), don’t make it back before the sun (the sun)
All you have to do is run (run)
Just promise me you'll run (run)
And don’t look back
Don’t look back
Don’t look back
Don’t look back
And promise me you run
If I should claim a victim
To devour before the light
I pray that you forgive me
It’s just my appetite
If I (if I), don’t make it back before the sun (the sun)
All you have to do is run (run)
Just promise me you'll run (run)
And don’t look back
Don’t look back
Don’t look back
Don’t look back
And promise me you run
And if I (And if I)
I should try (I should try)
Try to lure you baby (try to lure you back)
Oooooh, ooooh you just try to get as far away as you can (Oooh Aaah)
And don’t look back
Don’t look back
Don’t look back
Don’t look back
Don’t look back
Don't look back
And promise me you'll run
Don't you run, don't you run
What's your name? Who's your daddy
Is a rich like me (Like me, like me)
Has it taken, the time to show ya
All the things you need to live
Tell it to me slowly
I really want to know
Is the time of the season for lovin', lovin'
