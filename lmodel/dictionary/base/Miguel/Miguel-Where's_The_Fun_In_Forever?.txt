<song artist="Miguel" title="Where's_The_Fun_In_Forever?">
Where's the fun in forever
Swimmin' in a sea of time
If we only knew beginning
No end in sight
To feel a love
Where's the fun in forever
Would you love so hard
We're just tryin' to be better
Cause we have come this far
Oooh oooh
Have you ever stopped to think about how it'll be anyway
Tomorrow's just a day away yea
Tomorrow's just a day away
Tomorrow's just a day away
Oh tomorrow's just a day away
And tomorrow isn't promised
Where's the fun in forever
Celebrate
Ooooh
Ooooh
Where's the meaning in tomorrow
Where's the lust?
Where's the angst?
Never feel like time is borrowed
Cause it's all the same
Ooooh
It's kinda sad to think about the way that it would be
Thank goodness that
Tomorrow's just a day away yea
Tomorrow's just a day away
Tomorrow's just a day away
Oh tomorrow's just a day away
And tomorrow isn't promised
Where's the fun in forever
Celebrate
Hey
Tomorrow's just a day away yea
Tomorrow's just a day away
Tomorrow's just a day away
Oh tomorrow's just a day away
And tomorrow isn't promised
Where's the fun in forever
You gotta celebrate
Where's the fun in forever
Gotta live it like it's your last
Got to toast for the moment
Celebrate, celebrate
Celebrate, celebrate
Celebrate, celebrate
Celebrate, celebrate
It's a crazy thought to think how it would be
Thank goodness that
Tomorrow's just a day away yea
Tomorrow's just a day away
Tomorrow's just a day away
Oh tomorrow's just a day away
And tomorrow isn't promised
Where's the fun in forever
Celebrate
