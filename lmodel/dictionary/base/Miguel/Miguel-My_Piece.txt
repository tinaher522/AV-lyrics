Verse: 
Baby you are my peace of mind 
Other chicks want a piece of me 
Get the peace sign 
You get the piece of love 
Reserved in my heart 
For you and you only 
They peep and persist, why 
Keep reachin 
Need to seize and desist 
That's why i keep you equipped 
Yeah, for the schemers 
Thinkin they gone come between us 
You can be my piece

Verse: 
I,i,i, i got a firearm fetish 
Fascination 
Infatuation 
Yeah, for my heater, bang
Raise a temp, give them fever 
How i wish i could hold i could squeeze her 
We make them reach for the sky 
Laugh, make them cry 
But lay till i die 
So they can test our trust 
But they'll never get the best of us 
Bet, that
