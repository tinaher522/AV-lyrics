Is there a God?
Is he watching?
Is she watching?
Are they watching now?
If not, what are we doing?
Where are we going?
What are we doing now?
Look at all these people
Searching for a reason,
Searching for a piece of mind. Hey!
They say we're all created equal,
That's what they teach us,
But that ain't how we treat each other
Nah that ain't how we treat each other
Shit, The truth is that we need each other, yeah.
Diamond in the back,
Babies on crack,
Kickin' the door,
Wavin the four four
White collar war crime, money gets spent
Candles in the sun, blowin in the wind
Sun goes down,
Heroes often get shot
Peace is long been forgot
Ohh, will it be too late when we found out?
That we're all that we got
Take a look around now, yeah
Just take a look around, here
Business and governments just, watch as the innocent fade.
Mindless bureaucracy fails, hindering government aid.
Aren't you appalled?
What are we doing?
Where are we going?
What are we doing?
Diamond in the back,
Babies on crack,
Kickin' the door,
Wavin' the four four
Candles in the sun, blowin in the wind
Sun goes down,
Heroes often get shot
Peace is long been forgot
Ohh will it be too late when we found out? Yeah
That we're all that we got
Look around
Just Take a look around, yeah
Look around
We're all that we got
(ooh)
May we all live long
and may we all be brave
and the bridges we burn, only light our way
May we all be strong
and we all be brave 
and the bridges we burn, only light our way
May we all live long
May we all be brave
and the bridges we burn, only light our way
May we all live long
and we all be brave
and the bridges we burn, will be the bridges we burn
We're all that we got
(ooh)
We're all that we got
(ooh)
We're all that we got
(Nah)
look around now
That we're all that we got
(Yeah Yeah)
Is there a God?
Is he watching?
Is she watching?
Are they watching now?
Is there a God?
I'm sure he's watching
What are we doing?
Where are we going, nah?
Take a look around now
We're all that we got
