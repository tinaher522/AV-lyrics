<song artist="Miguel" title="Hero">
(yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm here to catch you when you fall 
I'm here to answer when you call 
In the morning, in the evening, baby even in the afternoon 
I got the strength and the nerve 
Here to protect you and to serve 
In the morning, in the evening, baby even in the afternoon 
I'm your hero, hero, defender protector for you 
For you, for you! 
I'm your hero, hero, defender protector for you 
For you, for you! 
I'll be your superman in bed 
Yeah you heard just what i said 
In the morning, in the evening, baby even in the afternoon 
I'll stop a train for ya 
I'll catch a plane for ya 
Suga don't never doubt it (no if, ands, or buts about it)
In the morning, in the evening, baby even in the afternoon 
Cause I'm your hero, hero, defender protector for you 
For you, for you! 
I'm your hero, hero, defender protector for you 
For you, for you! 
From the heights in the sky, to the depths in the sea 
I'm your guy 
I'm your guy, yeah 
No mask, no suit, no cape, no weapon, no group 
Got the power of love baby, give me a chance, yeah!
I'm your hero, hero, defender protector for you 
For you, for you! 
I'm your hero, hero, defender protector for you 
For you, for you!
