<song artist="Miguel" title="DEAL">
Love me, love me for profit, I can make you go down
I can show you the money if you wanna know how
When you're ready, come and get me, I'm on Capitol Hill
Before I show you the money, let me spot you the bill
Want money? Got clout
Need bitches, need bitches
Give it to me
Want money? Got clout
Need bitches, need bitches
Give it to me
Give it to me
Give it to me
Give it to me
Give it to me, give it to me
No one's paying attention now, they just wanna dance
You could be holdin' the future in the palm of your hands
So when you're ready, come and get me, I'm on Capitol Hill
Before I show you the money, let me spot you the bill
Want money? Got clout
Need bitches, need bitches
Give it to me
Want money? Got clout
Need bitches, need bitches
Give it to me
Give it to me
Give it to me
Give it to me
Give it to me, give it to me
Gotta do it all the same
Give it to me, give it to me
All we need is clout
All we need is money
Gotta play the game
We can take it all the way
Want money? Got clout
Need bitches, need bitches
Give it to me
Want money? I got clout
Need bitches, need bitches
Give it to me
Give it to me
Give it to me
Give it to me
Give it to me
Talk about love
When I'm in control
Give it to me
Give it to me
Give it to me
