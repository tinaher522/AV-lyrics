<song artist="Miguel" title="P***y_Is_Mine">
Keep it one hundred babe
We both know, I'm not the only one
But when I'm there, you treat a nigga
Real good
And that's probably why I always come, yeah
So lie to me, lie to me, lie to me
So sweet
Cause I don't ever want to imagine
All the other niggas like me
Ever had a chance, to get in your pants
So
[Chorus]
Tell me that the pussy is mine, yeah
Tell me, tell me baby, that its all mine
Tell me that that pussy is mine, ooo
Cause I don't wanna believe that anyone
Is just like me
Like me
Oh woo
Could you just lie to me, lie to me, lie to me
So sweet, baby ignorance is bliss
Yeah I know exactly what this is
Just
[Chorus]
