I just wanna be wherever you are 
I just wanna know your there 
I just wanna see whatever you see 
Cause I know you're not too shy to share, no
[Hook] 
Cause everywhere I go and everyone I touch 
What I already know is not enough 
And no one's taught me quite like you, no 
Followin my eyes searching for the real 
Knowing that there's not much else 
Tell me that you hear what I'm saying 
Ooh I swear you know the very best way to 
[Chorus] 
Teach me, train me, guide me baby (ooh) 
Only you can release the love inside me bae 
(I've waited my turn and I'm ready to learn now) 
Teach me, train me, guide me baby (ooh, oh oh) 
Only you can release the love inside me bae
In and out love me down playing with my dirty mind 
Show somethin (ohhh)
Show and tell (ohhh) 
Show something
Playing with my dirty mind

Show and tell (oohh)

Feel it at the very same time (yeaah) 
I wanna know how to make you cry 
How to make your body cream 
Feel my dirty mind with your favorite erotic dream 
Oooh show me what to do, yeh
[Hook] 
Cause everywhere I go and everyone I touch 
What I already know is not enough 
And no one's taught me quite like you, no 
Following my eyes searching for the real 
Knowing that there's not much else 
Tell me that you hear what I'm saying

[Hook 2] 
Anywhere we are I'm daring you to demonstrate 
The front seat in my car close your eyes and accelerate 
If you've never seen saturn take a ride on my rocket babe 
Your body is a party and I just want to celebrate 
(Repeat) 
Anywhere we are  
The front seat in my car 
If you've never seen saturn 
Your body is a party bae
Anywhere we are  (anywhere we are anywhere we go) 
The front seat in my car 
If you've never seen saturn 
Your body is a party bae (ooohh ohh)
[Chorus] 
Teach me, train me, guide me bae
Release the love inside me bae
Teach me, train me, guide me bae 
Release the love inside me bae 
Teach me, train me, guide me bae
Release the love inside me bae
Teach me, train me, guide me bae 
Release the love inside me bae
