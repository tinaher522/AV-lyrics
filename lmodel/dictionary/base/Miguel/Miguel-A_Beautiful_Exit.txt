News Reporter:
We begin with breaking news here at 5 O' clock of a police pursuit
Don't ever sell yourself short, sell your acceptance
Accept the new, don't linger on the past
Believe yourself, trust your intuition
You're here for a reason, you know
Speeding through all of these red lights, fast life
Dreaming a beautiful exit
We're gonna die young
Speeding through all of these red lights, fast life
Dreaming a beautiful exit
We're gonna die young
Ignore the planned conventions of society
The muted world, doesn't dream in color
No fear, no shame, wildhearts can't be broken
You're here for a reason, you know
Speeding through all of these red lights, fast life
Dreaming a beautiful exit
We're gonna die young
Speeding through all of these red lights, fast life
Dreaming a beautiful exit
We're gonna die young, we're gonna die young
We're gonna die young, we're gonna die young
We're gonna die young
All our problems were so extra small to astronauts
You can ditch the tangled patterns run by your parents
Sleep may be your only chance to hear yourself
You're here for a reason, you know
News Reporter:
Gonna continue, really has no other choice but to just keep riding
