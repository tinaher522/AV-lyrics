<song artist="Miguel" title="Girl_With_The_Tattoo_Enter.Lewd">
Those innocent eyes (eyes)
That smile on your face makes it easy to trust you
If they only knew,
The girl with the tattoo, like I do
Doin' what you doin'
Just to get you where you goin',
Yeah I see it, baby
Just don't lose yourself along the way, no
'Cause your doin'
What you doin'
Just to get you where your goin'
And I see it baby
And too many others gon' ask, to say I do
But I knew,
The girl with the tattoo, yeah
Oh yeah I knew, the girl with the tattoo
I used to know
