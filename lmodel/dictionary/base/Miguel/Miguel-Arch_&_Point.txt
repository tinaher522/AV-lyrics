<song artist="Miguel" title="Arch_&_Point">
Yeah
Black leather skirt and a leopard print shirt, woho
Skip dinner heading straight for desert, woho ho oh
But when it feels so good then it just come natural, woho
Baby, arch your back and point your toes
Ballerina smile but your sex like art, oho
I'm saying rhythm is a talent that can not be a taught, woho hoho, babe
When it feels so good then it just come natural
Baby, arch your back, point your toes
See, I don't suppose
Mmhm, that every good girl know
Uhu, all that every bad girl know
So baby, arch your back
And point your toes, yeah
Fishnet bodysuit, birthday cake, woho
Fetish is a pleasure you cannot be faked, woho hoho
But when it feels this good then it just comes natural
Baby, arch your back and point your toes
Oh, polaroid flash, baby, anything goes
Feeling high, don't keep your eyes closed
Cause when it feels this good, baby, just come natural
Baby arch your
You know what to do
Yeah baby
You know I don't suppose
Oh, that every good girl knows, yeah
Oh, all that every bad girl knows
Say, arch go back and point your toes, yeah
Mhm, mhm
Baby, arch your back and point your toes
