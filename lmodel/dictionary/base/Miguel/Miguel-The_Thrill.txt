<song artist="Miguel" title="The_Thrill">
Can you roll down a window
I just wanna feel the wind blow in my face
'Cause this morning is gonna get ugly and undone
That's why I never wanna close my eyes
Yeah, I can feel them right in the air tonight
Got a trouble, you can tell
And I can't wait
And I can't wait
It's the thrill, I feel my heart beat racing
And I can't wait, can't wait
Jamie, Johhny and Jack, no
Shoot 'em up, shoot, shot up
Dance it up, we never black out
Never chase, never waste, never hesitate noo
'Cause this morning is cold, I'm of time
We're just laughing as we loose our mind, yeah
We could be a riot in the air tonight
Start to call it trouble, you can tell
And I can't wait
And I can't wait
It's the thrill I feel my heart beat racing
And I can't wait, can't wait
Till they play our song, till the lights go on
Till we can't drive home shout
Give me more, give me more
Till we're alone, til we greet the sun
Give me more, give me more, yeah
Give me more, give me more
And I can't wait
And I can't wait
It's the thrill I feel my heart beat racing
And I can't wait, can't wait
