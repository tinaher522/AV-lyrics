<song artist="Miguel" title="How_Many_Drinks?">
Frustration, watching you dance
Invitation, to get in them pants
Come closer baby, so I can touch
One question, am I movin' too fast?
Cause I ain't leavin alone, feel like I could be honest, babe!
We both know that we’re grown
That’s why I wanna know 
How many drinks would it take you to leave with me?
Yeah, you look good and I got money
But I don’t wanna waste my time
Back of my mind I’m hopin you say two or three
You look good, we came to party 
But I don’t wanna waste my time
Temptation, is calling your name
Sweet persuasion, baby this is a game
Come closer, baby, if you like what you hear
Impression, is what I'm makin you feel
Cause I ain't leavin alone, feel like I could be honest, babe!
We both know that we’re grown
That’s why I wanna know 
How many drinks would it take you to leave with me?
Yeah, you look good and I got money
But I don’t wanna waste my time
Back of my mind I’m hopin you say two or three
You look good, we came to party 
But I don’t wanna waste my time (waste my time)
No, no, no
I ain't judgin
If you do decide that you might be fuckin' tonight, what?
More power to you if you do decide that you might be fuckin' tonight
Le-le-let me dig that out like a fossil
Damn baby that ass is colossal
Pilates a mill did that body so good 
You've gotten a pair I wish I could
How many drinks would it take you to leave with me? 
You look good and we came to party but I don't wanna waste my time. 
Back of my mind I'm hopin you say two or three
Agree? Indeed
You look good and we came to party but don't wanna waste my time,
Or waste your time, or waste your time, or waste our time
Baby it's alright, baby it's alright, baby it's alright
Oh it's alright now, alright, oh yeah
I don't wanna waste my time
I don't wanna waste no time
I don't wanna waste your time
I don't wanna waste our time, 
Or my time
How many drinks would it take you to leave with me?
Yeah, you look good and I got money
But I don’t wanna waste my time
Back of my mind I’m hopin you say two or three
You look good, we came to party 
But I don’t wanna waste my time (waste my time)
No, no, no
I ain't judgin
If you do decide that you might be fuckin' tonight, what?
More power to you if you do decide that my might be fuckin' tonight
I ain't judgin
If you do decide that you might be fuckin' tonight, what?
More power to you if you do decide that my might be fuckin' tonight
Let's go, shit
You only live once right?
I mean, where's the fun in forever anyway?
