<song artist="Miguel" title="What's_Normal_Anyway">
Too proper for the black kids, too black for the Mexicans
Too square to be a hood nigga, what's normal anyway?
Too opinionated for the pacifist, too out of touch to be in style
Too broke for the rich kids, I don't know what normal is
What's normal anyway? What's normal anyway?
I mean what's normal anyway? What's normal anyway?
What's normal anyway?
I'm in a crowd and I feel alone, I look around I not feel alone
I never feel like I belong, I wanna feel like I belong
Somewhere, somewhere
I'm in a crowd and I feel alone, I look around and I feel alone
I never feel like I belong, I wanna feel like I belong
Too immoral for the Christians, but too moral for the cut-throat
Too far out for the in crowd, what's normal anyway?
Too involved in my own life to spend time with my family
Too concerned about what others think
What's normal anyway? What's normal anyway?
I mean what's normal anyway? What's normal anyway?
What's normal anyway?
I'm in a crowd and I feel alone, I look around and I feel alone
I never feel like I belong, I wanna feel like I belong
Somewhere, somewhere, somewhere
Don't let them change you, just be who you are, who you are
Don't let them change you, you can't please them all, them all
In a crowd and I feel alone, I look around and I feel alone
I never feel like I belong, I wanna feel like I belong, somewhere
Don't let them change you, just be who you are, who you are
Don't let them change you, you can't please them all, them all
In a crowd and I feel alone, I look around I not feel alone
I never feel like I belong, I wanna feel like I belong, somewhere
