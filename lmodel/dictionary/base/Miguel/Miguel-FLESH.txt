<song artist="Miguel" title="FLESH">
Savage and an angel, we call out in tantrum
Glad I kept on your throat, we would rather turn down
And I think she bankrupt
Breathe, breathe
Flesh,
I mean it, I'm a mess
Now I'm a slave to your flesh
Woman put me right where I belong
Skin on you is always
Calling me with your face
Wrap yourself around me,
Do whatever I say
Kiss me like a creep now,
Sweet, sweet control
Flesh, addicted, yeah
I mean it, I'm a mess,
Now I'm a slave to your flesh
Woman put me right where I belong
Fall on your faith like you faith for religion
The light in the way, you're begging for forgiveness
Lost summers here as we both bathe in sweet sin
Leave it to me, I'll give you something to believe in
Surrender to friction (kiss me, kiss me, kiss me, kiss me)
This is body language and deep diction
I love it, back for it, yeah, yeah, yeah
Flesh, addicted, yeah
I mean it, I'm a mess,
Now I'm a slave to your flesh
Woman put me right and wrap it all
Come here darling, help me tackle this darling
I don't wanna let go
All of a sudden baby, darling no
