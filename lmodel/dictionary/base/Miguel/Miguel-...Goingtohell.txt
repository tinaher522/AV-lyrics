<song artist="Miguel" title="...Goingtohell">
Are you afraid of me?
Because I'm afraid of you
Cause I'm afraid of what this could mean
And I'm afraid of what this could do
Going to hell, I know, I know
I don't care, I'm in love
I'm going to hell with you
With you, with you, with you
I don't care, I'm in love, in love
Only you can save me I'm a sinner
Save me I'm, save me I'm a sinner
Only you can save me I'm a sinner
Save me I'm, save me I'm a sinner
These bittersweet notions of forever
Blossom and find me in my dreams
At least we die, I hope we die together
Is I know that's where we'll be
Going to hell, I know, I know
I don't care, I'm in love
I'm going to hell with you
With you, with you, with you
I don't care, I'm in love, in love
Only you can save me I'm a sinner
Save me I'm, save me I'm a sinner
Only you can save me I'm a sinner
Save me I'm, save me I'm a sinner
Going to hell, I know, I know
I don't care, I'm in love
I'm going to hell with you
With you, with you, with you
I don't care, I'm in love, in love
Only you can save me I'm a sinner
Save me I'm, save me I'm a sinner
Only you can save me I'm a sinner
Save me I'm, save me I'm a sinner
