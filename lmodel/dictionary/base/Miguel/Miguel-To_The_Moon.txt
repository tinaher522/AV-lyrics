<song artist="Miguel" title="To_The_Moon">
I've got a rocket in my pocket
And I'm ready to go
I'm talking tic tic time bomb
ready to blow
Just hold on tight
It's gonna be a long night     
Your on a first class flight to the stars (yeah)
Strap in pretty thing its gonna be a bumpy ride
Don't you hesitate
I'm gonna take you straight
To the moon babe
Me and you babe
To the moon babe
Are you ready to the ride?
I'm going till you beg me to stop
I'll be the supernova star tour 
im your guide
your body is a rollercoaster
I wanna ride
Hold on tight 
It's gonna be a long night 
Your on a first class flight to the stars (yeah)
Strap in pretty thing its gonna be a bumpy ride
Don't you hesitate
I'm gonna take you straight
To the moon babe
Me and you babe
To the moon babe
Are you ready to ride?

The moon babe

To the moon babe
Are you ready to ride?
I'm going till you beg me to stop (oh)
Are you ready for the ride of your life? (baby)

When we start the countdown
It'll be a deep impact darling 
So hold on tight
You'll be floating by the time you arrive (yeah)
To the moon babe
Me and you babe 
To the moon babe
Are you ready to ride?
I'm going till you beg me to stop
