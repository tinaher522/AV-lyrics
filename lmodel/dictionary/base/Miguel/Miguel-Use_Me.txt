<song artist="Miguel" title="Use_Me">
Sedate me
Salacious, salty, &amp; sweet.
I’m overwhelmed by tasty thoughts of you
Daydream... my body's waving a white flag
Take me, yeah, baby!
Now, I know I'm sober
It's just so profound
That every wall I built up
Has coming crashing down
Don’t the waves pull the sand?
Don’t the moon pull a tide, baby?
Well, I'm yours! Yeah!
Use me
Wanna give you control
With the lights on
If I could just let go
Forgive me
It's the very first time
That I'm nervous
Can I trust you, huh?
Trust me, while I take this off
With the lights on cause it turns me on
If you're nervous, just let me show
You how to touch me
I could teach you yeah
Sensation... as I place my tongue on your lips
You overwhelmed by everything I do, oh!
Curse me, yea, with such a beautiful nightmare!
Don’t wake me! Yeah, baby!
Now, I know I'm sober
It's just so profound, yea, 
That every wall I built up
Has coming crashing down, yea!
Don’t the waves pull the sand?
Don’t the moon pull a tide, baby?
Well, I'm yours! 
Yeah!
Use me
Wanna give you control
With the lights on
If I could just let go
Forgive me. It's the very first time
That I'm nervous
Can I trust you, huh?
Trust me, while I take this off
With the lights on cause it turns me on
If you're nervous, just let me show
You how to touch me
I could teach you, yeah
Blissful collision as our bodies tangle, intertwine
Biting your lip (uh-uh) baby, put me inside
Crucified thoughts, tender moments on a ricochet
Purging my mind of the power I own
Fall into forever. Just forgive me
I was faithless. Danger in your eyes
Baby, you can devour me!
Defile me, yeah!
Use me
Wanna give you control
With the lights on
If I could just let go
Forgive me. It's the very first time
That I'm nervous
Can I trust you, huh?
Trust me, while I take this off
With the lights on cause it turns me on.
If you're nervous, just let me show
You how to touch me, I could teach you, yeah
You how to touch me, I could teach you, yeah
You how to touch me, I could teach you, yeah
Use me.
