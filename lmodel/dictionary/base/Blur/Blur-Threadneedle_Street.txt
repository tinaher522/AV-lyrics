<song artist="Blur" title="Threadneedle_Street">
The time has come
Not to be cautious
He must be careful not to make mistakes
For every half hour
In twenty-four 
And operations rose
Faster than they did yesterday
And the lending rates on your side
So there won't be
Much of a problem 
Then past midnight
There is a rise
When everybody's asleep at home
He becomes nervous
And sees a change 
Today Futures 
Watch the markets from the street
In a pocket in a grey flannel suit
Read tomorrow's crash today
And check your pulse 
Base metals crawled onto the kerb
And softs dropped in a summer turn
And sugar melted in the mouth
Of a rude girl
Who knew a better option 
She thinks for a while
And it could be
A long time before he thinks again
And then he looks at the papers
And looks again 
Today Futures
