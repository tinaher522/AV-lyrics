<song artist="Blur" title="Swamp_Song">
Give me good times
Give me saliva
Give me fever
I'm a believer, yeah, yeah
Give me insane
Give me space brains
Give me music give me love
Abandon us in love
Give me good times
There no joke rhymes
Give me easy breathing
Give me everything, everything, everything
Give me good times
And give me saliva
Give me fever
I'm a believer
Give me insane
Give me space brains
Don't leave me ever
We'll live forever 
Yes, we will
I know we will
Give me good times
Give me saliva
Give me fever
I'm a believer
Give me insane
Give me space brains
Give me music give me love
Abandon us in love
Stick it in my veins
