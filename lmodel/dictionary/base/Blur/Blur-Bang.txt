<song artist="Blur" title="Bang">
Sitting in an S.D.T
Waiting for an underground train
to rumble underneath my feet
Bang goes another day
Where it went I could not say
And now I'll have to wait another week
When all is said and all is done
What was said was never done
Don't panic it's not really worth your while
Bang goes another year
In and and out of one ear
Everybody's doing it
So do it too
I don't need anyone
But a little love would make things better
Sitting on the early bus
Passing through the morning rush
It makes no difference
That I'm not with you
Bang goes another year
In and out of one ear
Everybody's doing it
I'll do it too
I don't need anyone
But a little love would make things better
aaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhh
I don't need anyone
But a little love would make things better
I don't need anyone
But a little love would make things better
I don't need anyone
But a little love would make things better
I don't need anyone
But a little of your love would make things better
