<song artist="Blur" title="End_Of_A_Century">
She says, there's ants in the carpet
Dirty little monsters
Eating all the morsels
Picking up the rubbish
Give her effervescence
She needs a little sparkle
Good morning, TV
You're looking so healthy
We all say, don't want to be alone
We wear the same clothes 'cause we feel the same
We kiss with dry lips when we say goodnight
End of a century, oh
It's nothing special
Sex on the TV
Everybody's at it
And the mind gets dirty
As you get closer to thirty
He gives her a cuddle
Glowing in a huddle
Good night, TV
Your all made up and you're looking like me
We all say, don't want to be alone
We wear the same clothes 'cause we feel the same
We kiss with dry lips when we say goodnight
End of a century, oh
It's nothing special
Can you eat her?
Yes, you can
We all say, don't want to be alone
We wear the same clothes 'cause we feel the same
We kiss with dry lips when we say goodnight
End of a century, oh
It's nothing special
We all say, don't want to be alone
We wear the same clothes 'cause we feel the same
We kiss with dry lips when we say goodnight
End of a century, oh
It's nothing special, oh
End of a century, oh
It's nothing special
