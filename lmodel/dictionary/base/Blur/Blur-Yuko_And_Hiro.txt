<song artist="Blur" title="Yuko_And_Hiro">
This is my work place
And these are the people I work with
Yuko and Hiro
We work together
We work for the company
That works to the future
They will protect us
We work together
I never see you
We are never together
I'll love you forever
I drink in the evenings
It helps with relaxing
I can't sleep without drinking
We drink together
From monday to Saturday
I go to my workplace
But on Sunday we are together
Yuko and Hiro
