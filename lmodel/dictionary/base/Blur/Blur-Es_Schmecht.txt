<song artist="Blur" title="Es_Schmecht">
Looking out for number one
the conversation in the dayroom's gone
It's a brutal thought but you thought it
And in the future it'll be the same
Waltzing on an autobahn
there is cause for alarm
It's a neurotic thought but you thought it
And in the future it'll be the same
