<song artist="Blur" title="Bone_Bag">
When you see in see you dancing
Own reflection was never bent
Be a man can shake you bone bag
One day up is another down
I don't want to hurt, no not ever
No not ever 
This is my street, I stay here and sleep
You're outside on sunny days
Nicotine flow stops a pain grow
Stay a while so nearly there
I don't want to hurt, no not ever
No not ever 
This is my street I stay here and sleep
You're outside on sunny days
Be a man can shake you bone bag
One day up is another day
I don't want to hurt, no not ever
No not ever
