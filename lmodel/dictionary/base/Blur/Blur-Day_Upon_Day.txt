<song artist="Blur" title="Day_Upon_Day">
Waiting on this empty day
It's just the same as any day
An' although I got nothing to say
I'm going to say it anyway 
Day, day upon day, day upon day
Day upon day
Day, day upon day, day upon day
Day upon day 
Everybody's here with me
We're in the smallest rooms you see
An' although we got nothing to do
We going to do what do I do
