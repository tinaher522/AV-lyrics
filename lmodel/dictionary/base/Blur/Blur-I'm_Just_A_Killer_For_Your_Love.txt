<song artist="Blur" title="I'm_Just_A_Killer_For_Your_Love">
I heard a man who had no lungs
He took me in and made me lunch
He told me how I'd lost a friend
He smiled at me it was the end
I said
I'm just a killer for your love
I cut my hair off in the road
I take my coat off dropped my load
I wipe my hands on the grass
'Cause I know that nothing ever lasts
And I said
I'm just a killer for your love
