<song artist="Blur" title="Ultranol">
For coughs and colds ans scabby holes
Itchy pimples, unseemly moles
For funny turns and Chinese burns
For aching heads we're most concerned
For staying lively, getting it nightly
This we guarantee
That's Ultranol, here's the new remedy
Before you go to bed take two or three
When you wake you'll feel better
Lalala...
For aches and pains and jellied brains
Help you sleep and smile again
They're aimless, blameless, almost nameless
You get much more although you pay less
Revitalise that sexual drive
In fact be born again
Yes Ultranol will put you on the map
Take 4 or 5 then have a little nap
When you wake up you'll feel better
For coughs and colds and your scabby holes
Lalala...
Keep you young although you're feeling old
Lalala...
If you're not protected you're gonna get it
Lalala...
So suck them and see you won't regret it
lalalalala lalalalala
Suck them and see
Suck them and see
Suck them and see
Suck them and see
