<song artist="Blur" title="Bugman">
I am the ex-offender
They let me out in the summer
I think I was in a coma
I didn't know what to do
Oh no
You go hang around go around
I'll watch myself, hang on
Look out for the Bugman
You go hang around go around
Watch yourself, hang on
Look out for the Bugman
I got no sent of existence
I know the nodding dogs
I go out in the city
I stay away from the bugs
Oh yeah
You go hang around go around
I'll watch myself, look out
Look out for the Bugman
You go hang around go around
Watch yourself, hang on
Look out for the Bugman
Bugman
I go out in the city
I stay away from the bugs
Oh yeah
La la la la la oh no
I go out in the city
I go out in the city
I stay away from the ooh ooh bugs
Space is the place
