St. Louis song
Something is wrong
I kill that man
From your own shoulders down
And here comes an empty
People look at each other like me
I don't want to be
I don't want to be he-here
I don't want to be
I don't want to be he-here
'Cause there's nothing
Here to be
St. Louis song
Where has the good thing gone?
Dreaming himself to hell
Stuck in his good cell
He's still trying to suffer
Left handed stop
I don't want to be
I don't want to be he-here
I don't want to be
I don't want to be he-here
Oh
I'm not trying to suffer
Left handed stop
I don't want to be
I don't want to be he-here
I don't want to be
I don't want to be he-here
