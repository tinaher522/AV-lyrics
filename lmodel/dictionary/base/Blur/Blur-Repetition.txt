<song artist="Blur" title="Repetition">
So sure
So sure you are
Nothing can
Touch you now
I need to know
Did you think of me
But you're forgettng me now
Slow down
Don't be so
Eager to let me go
Realise it could change you
It could change your mind
Try, try, try
All things remain the same
So why try again
