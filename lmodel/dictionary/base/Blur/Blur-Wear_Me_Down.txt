<song artist="Blur" title="Wear_Me_Down">
every time i come here
i'm not sure what to say
i know it should be easy
but it never seems that way
you you make me feel
like no one ever will
so why why do you bore me
until my heart is still
you
you wear me down
my defenses are gone now
and i can't fight
you
you wear me down
my defenses are gone now
and i can't fight
i can't say i love you easily
and you wouldn't want me to
so i'd rather just say nothing
and leave it up to you
then it's easy to forget
you're just as small as me
then it's easy to forget
you're just as foolish as me
you
you wear me down
my defenses are gone now
and i can't fight
you
you wear me down
my defenses are gone now
and i can't fight
you you make me feel
like no one ever will
so why why do you bore me
until my heart is still
you
you wear me down
my defenses are gone now
and i can't fight
you
you wear me down
my defenses are gone now
and i can't fight
