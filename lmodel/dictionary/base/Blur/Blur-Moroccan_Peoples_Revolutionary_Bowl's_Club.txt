<song artist="Blur" title="Moroccan_Peoples_Revolutionary_Bowl's_Club">
The trees are spinning oxygen
They're the rockets we should fear
If we go and let 'em off then we will disappear
Then we will disappear
Surely we will disappear
The road is hot and dusty
The desert needs a beer
But if we go and blow it up then we will disappear
We will disappear
Surely we will disappear
I we go and blow it up then we will disappear
We will disappear
Surely we will disappear
We will disappear
Surely we will disappear
We will disappear
Surely we will disappear
We will disappear
Surely we will disappear
