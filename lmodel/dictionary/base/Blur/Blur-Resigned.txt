<song artist="Blur" title="Resigned">
I think too much
On things I want too much
It makes me hateful
And I say stupid things
Only you can fill my blank heart
And I'm resigned to that
I wish the sun
Could just keep me warm
And I'm resigned to that
I'll forget to breathe someday
I've never stopped to think why
