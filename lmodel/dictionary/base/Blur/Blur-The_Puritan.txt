<song artist="Blur" title="The_Puritan">
Are we institutionalized by the demands of today? 
In our regalia, are we ok?
Because the flash of a blade is one less getting paid there in the line
And the ice and gold is just a double code; it's a paradigm
For every little thing that fashion gives you, yeah
So the puritan on a monday morning said, "happy/sad melody"
I'm waltzing on an amazing pulse in a pornographic sea
Where the absent blade is one less in the parade to throw overboard
And the ice and gold, it's just a double code; it's a metaphor
For every little thing that fashion gives you
I'm falling into something that plays upon the metronome in your heart
It's smoke and it's mirrors until the auto cue starts
Then the dry ice comes and we start sucking our thumbs on the tv
And the joy of people spirited away, so merrily
It's part of every little thing that fashion gives you
