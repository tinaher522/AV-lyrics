<song artist="Blur" title="I_Broadcast">
I love the aspects of another city
The representatives are alright
In circulation the snake and the tiger
Waking up clean shaven in industrial light
I broadcast
Buzzin' on another day now
All for a cold sore
Something out of nothing
I love the aspects of another city
It's got your number and your blood type
Living in tetrus I need soft focus
The apparitions of another prodigal night, right?
I broadcast
Buzzin' on another day now
All for a high score
Something out of nothing
I'm running
I'm running
I'm running
I broadcast
Buzzin' on another day now
All for a cold sore
Something out of nothing (x2)
