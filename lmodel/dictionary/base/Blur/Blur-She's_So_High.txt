<song artist="Blur" title="She's_So_High">
I see her face everyday
I see her face
It doesn't help me
I see her face everyday
I see her face
It doesn't help me
She's so high
She's so high
She's so high
I want to crawl all over her
She's so high
She's so high
She's so high
I want to crawl all over her
I think of her everyday
I think of her
It doesn't help me
I think of her everyday
I think of her
It doesn't help me
She's so high
She's so high
She's so high
I want to crawl all over her
She doesn't help me
She doesn't help me
She doesn't help me
She's so high
She's so high
She's so high
I want to crawl all over her
She's so high
She's so high
She's so high
I want to crawl all over her
