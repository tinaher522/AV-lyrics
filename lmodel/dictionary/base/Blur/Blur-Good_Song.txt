<song artist="Blur" title="Good_Song">
Waiting, got no town to hide in
The country's got a hold of my soul
TV's dead and there ain't no war in my head, now
And you seem very beautiful to me
Sleeping but my work's not done
I could be lying on an atom bomb
I'll take care
'Cause I know you'll be there
You seem very beautiful to me
It's the rest of your life, keeps rolling and rolling
Picture in my pocket, looks like you
It's the rest of your life. keeps rolling, rolling, rolling along
