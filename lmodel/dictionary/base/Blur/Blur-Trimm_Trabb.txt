<song artist="Blur" title="Trimm_Trabb">
I got no style
I'll take my time
All those losers on the piss again
I doze doze away
That's just the way it is
I got trimm trabb
Like the flash boys had
And I can't go back
Let it flow let it flow
I sleep alone
I sleep alone
That's just the way it is
Just the way it is
Just the way it is
Just the way it is
Just the way it is
That's just the way it is
I got trimm trabb
Like the flash boys had
And I can't go back
Let it flow let it flow
I sleep alone
I sleep alone
I got no style
I'll take my time
All those losers on the piss again
I doze doze away
That's just the way it is
I got trimm trabb
Like the flash boys had
And I can't go back
Let it flow let it flow
I sleep alone
I sleep alone
I sleep alone
