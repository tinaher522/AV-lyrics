<song artist="Blur" title="Entertain_Me">
The weekend is back
But so is he
Head to the floodlights
See the fraternity
They're waiting
I hear them up in the north
Down in the south
All that is spewing
Spewing out of his mouth
Entertain me
At his'n'hers dating
Bored minds agree
Requirements to be stated
And replies awaited
She wants a loose fit
He wants Instant Whip
Guesstimates her arrival
Will she want it
Really badly?
Entertain me
A car
A house
Both in a street
The boredom of a sober week
The weekend's here
Hip-hip-hooray
To make the blues
Just go away
Entertain me
