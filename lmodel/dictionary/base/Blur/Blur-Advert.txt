<song artist="Blur" title="Advert">
It is six o'clock on the dot and I am half way home
I feel foul monthed as I stand and wait for the underground
And a nervous disposition does not agree with this
I need something to remind me that there is something else
You need a holiday somewhere in the sun
With all the people who are waiting
There never seems to be one
Say something, say something else
Advertisements are here for rapid persuasion
If you stare too long you lose your appetite
And a nervous disposition does not agree with this
You need fast relief from aches and stomach pains
