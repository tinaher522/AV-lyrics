<song artist="Blur" title="Tell_Me,_Tell_Me">
Tell me, tell me, tell me please
What is this that hovers me it's
Driving me to a state of homepeless
Having any sex at all
Hasn't any worth at all
Or is it just enough to bitch
Yaie yaie yaie yaie yaie
Yaie yaie yaie yie-yie-yie yaie
The funny thing that makes me do
The things that I do to you
Oh I know they are so damn very tall
I'm in a state I can't explain
My mind is gone, my mind is gone
It seems so very little I can do
Yaie yaie yaie yaie yaie
Yaie yaie yaie yie-yie-yie yaie
Cause all these things I want to know
Tell me, tell me, tell me please
Tell me, tell me, tell me please
Tell me, tell me, tell me please
Won't you tell me please
I'm so full of emptiness
It's so hard to sustain the mess
I've no idea who I am at all
So tell me, tell me, tell me please
What is this that hovers me
Before I smash my head against the wall
Yaie yaie yaie yaie yaie
Yaie yaie yaie yie-yie-yie yaie
Cause all these things I want to know
Tell me, tell me, tell me please
Tell me, tell me, tell me please
Tell me, tell me, tell me please
Won't you tell me please
Tell me, tell me, tell me please
Tell me, tell me, tell me please
Tell me, tell me, tell me please
Won't you tell me please
