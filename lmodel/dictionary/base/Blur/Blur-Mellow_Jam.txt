<song artist="Blur" title="Mellow_Jam">
Do you feel like a chain-store
Practically floored
One of many zeros
Kicked around bored
Your ears are full, but you're empty
Holding out your heart
To people who never really
Care how you are
So give me coffee and T-V peacefully
I've seen so much, I'm going blind
And I'm brain-dead virtually
Sociability is hard enough for me
Take me away from this big bad world
And agree to marry me
So we can start over again
Do you go to the country
It isn't very far
There's people there who'll hurt you
'Cause of who you are
Your ears are full of their language
There's wisdom there you're sure
'Till the words start slurring
And you can't find the door
So give me coffee and T-V peacefully
I've seen so much, I'm going blind
And I'm brain-dead virtually
Sociability is hard enough for me
Take me away from this big bad world
And agree to marry me
So we can start over again
So give me coffee and T-V peacefully
I've seen so much, I'm going blind
And I'm brain-dead virtually
Sociability is hard enough for me
Take me away from this big bad world
And agree to marry me
So we can start over again
