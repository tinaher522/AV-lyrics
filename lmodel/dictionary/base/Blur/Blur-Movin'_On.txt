<song artist="Blur" title="Movin'_On">
At the music heist
I met the gourmet man
With aluminium lungs
He sucks out all he can
He sees the whole world go flip
In a stunt bug style
'Cause he's a parasite
With a cellulite pile but he can smile
'Cause this is the music
And we're movin' on, we're movin' on
Hey this is the music
We're movin' on, we're movin' on
We're sticky eyes and sticky bones
You get no time on your own
You get a dose and a ghost
You get it coast to coast
Dye your hair black
Get Satan tattooed on your back
Pierce yourself with a coke can
Put yourself in fake tan now you're in the band
Cause' this is the music
And we're movin' on, we're movin' on
Hey this is the music
We're movin' on, we're movin' on
No matter how low, there's always further to go
And we're movin' on, we're movin' on
No matter how low, there's always further to go
And we're movin' on, we're movin' on
We're movin' on, it won't be long
Hey this is the music
We're movin' on, we're movin' on
Yeah this is the music
We're movin' on, we're movin' on
No matter how low, there's always further to go
And we're movin' on, we're movin' on
No matter how low, there's always further to go
And we're movin' on, we're movin' on
