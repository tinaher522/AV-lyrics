<song artist="Blur" title="Battery_In_Your_Leg">
This is a ballad for the good times
So put a battery in your leg
Put a rock beat over anything
Get it stuck there in your head
You can be with me
I got nothing to rely on
I've broken every bone
Everybody's stopped believing
But you know you're not alone
You can be with me
This is a ballad for the good times
And all the dignity we had
Don't get caught up on the evil things
You ain't coming back
You can be with me
If you wanna be
You can be with me
