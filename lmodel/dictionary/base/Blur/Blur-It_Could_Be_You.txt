Churchill
Got his lucky number
Tomorrow there's another
Could be me
Could be you
No silver spoon
Sticky teeth, they rot too soon
You've got to have the best tunes
Or that's it
You've blown it
All we want is to be happy
In our homes like happy families
Be the man on the beach with the world at his feet
Yes, it could be you
The likely lads
Are picking up the uglies
Yesterday they were just puppies
Beery slurs
Now life's a blur
Telly addicts
You should see them at it
Getting in a panic
Will we be there
Trafalgar Square?
All we want is to be happy
In our homes like happy families
Be the man on the beach with the world at his feet
Yes, it could be you
Could be me
Could be you
Should be me
Should be you
But don't worry
If it's not your lucky number
'Cause tomorrow there's another
Could be you
Could be me
