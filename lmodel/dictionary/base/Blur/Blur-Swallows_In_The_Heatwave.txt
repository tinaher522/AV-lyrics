<song artist="Blur" title="Swallows_In_The_Heatwave">
I want to contribute
To natural selection
Buy myself a razor
Watch swallows in the heatwave
Meet the rebel leaders
They're coming cause they need us
Ooo oo oo ooooo
I don't have a history
For religion
Goin' out to get one
Get into the Volvo
Drive into the mountains
Watch swallows in the heatwave
