<song artist="Blur" title="High_Cool">
When you come here
Which you sometimes do
Don't think that
I really want you to
And if you come here
Which you always do
Don't think that
I expect you to
Is that all I give you
Is that all I give you
And you talk too much
Which you always do
Don't think that
I really want you to
And if you talk too much
Which you always do
Don't think that
I really need you to
Is that all I give you
Is that all I give you
