<song artist="Blur" title="Trouble_In_The_Message_Centre">
I am the message centre
Local and direct
Room to room an operator (No calls today, dear, they'll just have to wait, dear)
I call and I collect (So just strike him softly away from the body)
You're made up too shiny today
In so much trouble
Your thoughts are just pissing away
In so much trouble
So much trouble
I am a manager
And I am in control
As the local delegator (No calls today, dear, they'll just have to wait, dear)
I offer no guarantee at all (So don't take it lightly, you passed your sell-by date)
You're made up too shiny today
In so much trouble
Your thoughts are just pissing away
In so much trouble
A new typeface, a new day
In so much trouble
You can't remember ten minutes ago
In so much trouble
Too much trouble
You're made up too shiny today
In so much trouble
Your thoughts are just pissing away
In so much trouble
A new typeface, a new day
In so much trouble
You can't remember ten minutes ago
In so much trouble
It's too much trouble
