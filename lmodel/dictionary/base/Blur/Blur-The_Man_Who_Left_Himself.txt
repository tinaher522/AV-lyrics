<song artist="Blur" title="The_Man_Who_Left_Himself">
All good people your time will come
Work forever and still not be done
Close your tired eyes, noone knows you've gone
It's not forever but today you've become
The man who left himself
Don't belong here, your heart beats too fast
Feel the mis-beat, it starts and stops
Don't be frightened, these things never last
Maybe tomorrow your time will have passed
It's the man who left himself
