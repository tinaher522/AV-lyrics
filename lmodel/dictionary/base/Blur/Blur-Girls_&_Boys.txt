<song artist="Blur" title="Girls_&_Boys">
Street's like a jungle
So call the police
Following the herd
Down to Greece
On holiday
Love in the nineties
Is paranoid
On sunny beaches
Take your chances
Looking for girls who are boys
Who like boys to be girls
Who dig boys like they're girls
Who dig girls like they're boys
Always should be someone you really love
Avoiding all work
'Cause there's none available
Low battery thinkers
Count your thoughts
On one, two, three, four, five fingers
Nothing is wasted
Only reproduced
You get nasty blisters
Du bist sehr sch√∂n
But we haven't been introduced
Girls who are boys
Who like boys to be girls
Who dig boys like they're girls
Who dig girls like they're boys
Always should be someone you really love
Girls who are boys
Who like boys to be girls
Who dig boys like they're girls
Who dig girls like they're boys
Always should be someone you really love
Ah ah ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah ah
Looking for
Girls, boys
Boys, girls
Girls, boys
Boys, girls
Always should be someone you really love
Girls who are boys
Who like boys to be girls
Who dig boys like they're girls
Who dig girls like they're boys
Always should be someone you really love
Girls who are boys
Who like boys to be girls
Who dig boys like they're girls
Who dig girls like they're boys
Always should be someone you really love
Girls who are boys
