<song artist="Blur" title="Bustin'_+_Dronin'">
Coming from your eyes
No more selfish lies
It's an awful week
Marry me in jeans
There's nothing on the wall
In the bitter hall
The neon lights are on
That's where my bitter gone
Man alive
Man alive
Man alive
Man alive
Adrenalin is weak
Shifting as we speak
And the beers flow down
Ritual underground
And it seems to change
Weather, it's a game
The neon lights are on
Stellar we'll take off
Man alive
Man alive
Man alive
Man alive
Man alive
Man alive
Man alive
Man alive
