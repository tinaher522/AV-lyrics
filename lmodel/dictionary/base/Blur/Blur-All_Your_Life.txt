<song artist="Blur" title="All_Your_Life">
Put a new shirt on, wash my face in beer
Fall through the crowd and disappear
In the magazines and shopping malls
Walk through the wildlife for miles and miles
Hold my breath and count a hundred and ten
And back up the hill to start again
Watch the spiders on the bedroom ceiling
They got big plans, so they're not breathing
Feel the frission of tomorrow today
I could get up but it won't go away
Do nothing to impress my friends
Just rub my eyes for hours on end
Oh England, my love, you lost me, made me look a fool
I need someone to tell me
Everything will be alright
I need someone who'll hold me
When the day turns to night
I need someone who loves me
more than you do
Oh we say that's not true
And you and me in line as double bill
Surrogate heroes on TV and films
I've never met anyone like you
I've never done the things you like to do
On the way to heaven in a comedy car
The new stars of melancholy, ah
There's nothing to get angry about
We're too hung over to be bash out
Oh England, my love, you've tattooed your past all over me
I need someone to tell me
Everything will be alright
I need someone who'll hold me
When the day turns to night
I need someone who loves me
more than you do
Oh we say that's not true
And you and me in line as double bill
I've got a feeling that nobody's sold
I've got a feeling that you'll let yoursef go go go
And days will be like this
All your life
And days will be like this
All your life
And people will always miss
All your life
And people will always miss
All your life
And days will be like this
And days will be like this
And days will be like this
