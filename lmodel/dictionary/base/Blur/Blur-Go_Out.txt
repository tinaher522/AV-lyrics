<song artist="Blur" title="Go_Out">
I get a set alone, dancing with myself
Greedy go-getter gone, the luxury is stealth
Obsidian the ha-a-a-a-a-all, dancing with myself
I get into my bed, I do it to myself
To the local, to the lo-o-o, I go out
To the lo-o-o-o-ocal, by myself
To the lo-o-o-o-ocal
I get into my head, there's nothing to be addressed now
There's nothing to get up about, 'cause we do it all the time
The shepherdess undone, she done it all again
I get ready to go, the greedy go-getter come
He going to the local
He going to the local-o-ohh
He going to the lo-o-o-o-ocal
He going to the lo-o-o-o-ocal
Too many Western men, top button left undone
Imperious their signs, the pedlars of luxury
A greedy go-getter in the sky bar, she on her own
She get ready to go, she does it with herself
She does it with herself
She does it with herself
She does it on her o-o-o-o-o-own
She does it on her o-o-o-o-o-own
