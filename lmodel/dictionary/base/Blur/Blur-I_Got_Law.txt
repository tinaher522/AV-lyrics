<song artist="Blur" title="I_Got_Law">
Feeling daft beyond gone bland
Made it to the goal on lense
President, he just got hair down below
Tomorrow never more...
Made it to the BCP
Everybody knows it's me
I got up another sand, 
The guilty cell
Tomorrow never more...
I got the law
I got the law
I got the law
I got the law
I got the law
I got the law
I got the law
I got the law
I got the law
I got the law
I got the law
I got the law
I got the law
I got the law
I got the law
I got the law
I got the law
I got the law
I got the law
I got the law
I got the law
I got the law
I got the law
Feeling Dove beyond con-pen
Nobody can take it there
Feel it now and do yourself until you're gone
Tomorrow never more...
Tomorrow never more...
