<song artist="Blur" title="Magic_America">
Bill Barret has a simple dream
He calls it his plan B
Where there are bulidings in the sky and the air is sugar-free
And everyone's very friendly
Well, plan B arrived on a holiday
He took a cab to the shopping malls
Bought and ate until he could do neither anymore
Then found love on Channel 44
La la la la la
He wants to go to magic America
La la la la la
He'd like to live in magic America
With all those magic people
Bill Barret sent his postcards home
To everyone he'd ever know
They read 59 cents gets you a good square meal
From the people who care how you feel
La la la la la
He wants to go to magic America
La la la la la
He'd like to live in magic America
With all the magic people
La la la la la
He wants to go to magic America
La la la la la
He'd like to live in magic America
La la la la la
So nice to be in magic America
La la la la la
He'd like to live in magic America
With all the magic people
With all the magic people (all the magic people)
With all the magic people (all the people, all the people)
