<song artist="Blur" title="Inertia">
Fear of being left behind
Can take you over
Suddenly you will choke
Maybe it's just a joke
I'm not sure of you
I can't hear you now
There's too much that's going around
You seem a worried fool
So don't think I'm cool
Makes me me unsure
Of you-
Fear of being left alone
Can take you over
Slowly you will choke
And say it's just a joke
I'm not sureâ€”of you
