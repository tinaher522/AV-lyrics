<song artist="Blur" title="Miss_America">
Miss America sits in the shower
She's plucking hours from the sky
Picks up the telephone into another home
Don't ask me why
I don't mind, I don't mind at all
I love only you
She's a well wisher and she wishes you well
Wish away, wish away
She's no jellybean, she's a jemima ho ho
Wish away, wish away
I don't mind, I don't mind at all
I love only you
Da do da da do 
Here is here and I am here
Where are you
Far away, far away
She's no jellybean, she's a jemima ho ho
Wish away, wish away back to the top
