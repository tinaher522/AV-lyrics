<song artist="Blur" title="Strange_News_From_Another_Star">
All I wanna be
Is washed out by the sea
No death star over me
Won't give me any peace
All I want is light relief
Put the crazies on the street
Give them guns and feed them meat
They'll shoot the death star down
Dig a hole and put it down
Thousand miles underground
They say it's no game
There's strange news from another star
I'm lost, I'm lost
There's strange news from another star
Give me all your stuff
Until I can't get up
Watch the whole world freeze
Counting tin cans in our sleep
Submarines are diving deep
I don't believe in me
I don't believe in me
All I've ever done is tame
Will you love me all the same
Will you love me, though it's always the same
They say it's no game
There's strange news from another star
I'm lost, I'm lost
There's strange news from another star
