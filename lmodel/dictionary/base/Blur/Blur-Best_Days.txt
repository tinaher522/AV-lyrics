<song artist="Blur" title="Best_Days">
Bow bells say goodbye to the last train
Over the river they all go again
Out in to leafy nowhere hope someone's
waiting out there for them
Cabbie has his mind on a fare to the sun
He works nights but it's not much fun
Picks up the London yo yo's, all on their way down Soho
Other people wouldn't like to hear you
If you said that these are the best days of their lives
Other people would turn around and laugh at you
If you said that these are the best days of their lives
Trellick towers been calling
I know she'll leave me in the morning
Yeah yeah 
In hotel cells listening to dial tones
Remote controls and cable moans
In his drink he's been talking
Gets disconnected sleepwalking back home
Other people wouldn't like to hear you
If you said that these are the best days of their lives
Other people would turn around and laugh at you
If you said that these are the best days of their lives
Other people wouldn't like to hear you
If you said that these are the best days of our lives
