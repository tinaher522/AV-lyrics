St. Louis song
Something is wrong
I kill that man
From your own shoulders down
And here comes an empty
People look at each other like me
I don't wanna be
I don't want to be he-here
I don't want to be he-here
'Cause there's nothing
Here to be-e-e-e-e
St. Louis song
Where has the good thing gone
Dreaming himself to hell
Stuck in his good cell
He's still trying to suffer
Left handed sto-o-o-p
I don't wanna be
I don't want to be he-here
I don't want to be he-here
Oohoooh
Oohoooh
Oohoooh
Oohoooh
I'm not trying to suffer
Left handed sto-o-o-p
I don't wanna be
I don't want to be he-here
I don't want to be he-here
I don't wanna be
I don't want to be he-here
I don't want to be he-here
