<song artist="Blur" title="Hanging_Over">
I'm alive
I can breathe the air
I can hurt you
I can float up here
So soft and tingling
You can't touch me
I'm floating away
I woke up 
And went down next door
I'm getting up with nothing on my mind
I went down the stairs
With a pain in my head
I should have never got out of bed
Then everything shattered
Just at the point that it mattered
Just at the point that it mattered
Aha
I'm alive I can breathe the air
I can hurt you
I can fall down there
Right into your mind
Don't put it around
You can't catch me
And carried away
I woke up, woke up every day
There is noting, nothing to say
Halfway down the stairs
I feel a pain in my chest
I should have never got out of bed
Then everything shattered
Just at the point that it mattered
Just at the point that it mattered
Aha
I'm alive, I can breathe the air
I can hurt you
Halfway down the stairs
I get a pain in my chest
I should never got out of bed
I should never ever ever
I should never.
