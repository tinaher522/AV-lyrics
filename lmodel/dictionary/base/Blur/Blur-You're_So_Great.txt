<song artist="Blur" title="You're_So_Great">
Sad, drunk and poorly
Sleeping really late
Sad, drunk and poorly
Not feeling so great
Wandering lost in a town full of frowns
Sad, drunk and poorly
Dog's digging up the ground
And I feel the light in the night and in the day
And I feel the light when the sky's just mud and grey
And I feel the light when you tell me it's okay
'Cause you're so great and I love you
Tea, tea and coffee
Helps to start the day
Tea, tea and coffee
Shake it all the way
City's alive, and surprise, so am I
Tea, tea and coffee
Got no sleep today
And I feel the light in the night and in the day
And I feel the light when the sky's just mud and grey
And I feel the light when you tell me it's okay
'Cause you're so great and I love you
