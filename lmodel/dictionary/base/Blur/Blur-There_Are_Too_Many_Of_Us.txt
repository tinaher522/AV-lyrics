<song artist="Blur" title="There_Are_Too_Many_Of_Us">
There are too many of us
That's plain to see
We all believe in praying
For our immortality
We pose this question to our children
That calls them all to stray
And live in tiny houses
Of the same mistakes we made
'Cos there are too many of us
In tiny houses here and there
Passing out of somewhere
But you won't care
There are too many of us
That's plain to see
And we all believe in praying
For our own immortality
For a moment I was dislocated
My terror on a loop elsewhere
The flashing lights part vacated
On the big screens everywhere
'Cos there are too many of us
In tiny houses here and there
Just passing out of somewhere
But you won't care
There are too many of us
In tiny houses here and there
All looking through the windows
On everything we share
We pose this question to our children
Leads them out to stray
And live in tiny houses
Of the same mistakes we've made
'Cos there are too many of us
It's plain to see
All living in tiny houses
Of our own mortality
