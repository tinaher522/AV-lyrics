<song artist="Blur" title="Essex_Dogs">
I remember thinking murder in the car
Watching dogs somersault through sprinklers on tiny lawns
I remember the graffiti
We are your children coming in with spray cans of paint
I remember the sunset and the plains of cement
And the way the night seems to turn the color of orangeade
In this town cellular phones are hot with ~thieves~ (teens)
In this town we all go to terminal pubs
It helps us sweat out those angry bits of life
From this town, the English Army grind their teeth into glass
You know you'll get a kicking tonight
Smell of puke and piss
Smell of puke and piss on your stilettos
Here comes that panic attack
My heart stops
Then it starts
Give me a drink
I'll drink your round
I'll take you round the pole
It's cold up here (I see the universe waiting by a minibus)
You'll catch the flu or you'll catch the city
Either way
You'll catch the flu or you'll catch the city
