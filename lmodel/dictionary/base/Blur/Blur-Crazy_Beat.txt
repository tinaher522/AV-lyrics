<song artist="Blur" title="Crazy_Beat">
You got to get it together
Stop shooting at me
You're just a teenage industry
Why are the CIA having fun
They think you're clever 'cause you've
blown up your lungs
But I love to hear that crazy beat
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Gets the people dancing on their feet
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
And I love to live in paradise
I love my brothers on a Saturday night
Break up!
I'm on my mobile
I'm talking to the president
I got to hit him for the money I've spent
Trying to get him to party with me
I even offered him ecstasy
But I love to hear that crazy beat
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Gets the people dancing on their feet
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
And I love to live in paradise
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I love my sister and I love her tonight
Break up, it's a beat
And I love to hear that crazy beat
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Gets the people dancing on their feet
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
And I love to live in paradise
I love my brothers on a Saturday night
And I love to hear that crazy beat
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Gets the people dancing on their feet
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
And I love to live in paradise
I love my sister and I love her tonight
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...
