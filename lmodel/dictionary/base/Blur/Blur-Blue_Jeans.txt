<song artist="Blur" title="Blue_Jeans">
Air cushioned soles
I bought them in the Portabello road
On a saturday
I stop and stare a while
A common pastime when conversation goes astray
And don't think I'm walking out of this
'Cause she don't mind
Whatever I say
Whatever I say
I don't really want to change a thing
I want to stay this way forever
Blue, blue jeans
I wear them every day
There's no particular reason to change
My thoughts are getting banal
I cant help it but i wont pull out hair another day
And don't think I'm walking out of this
'Cause she don't mind
Whatever I say
Whatever I say
I don't really want to change a thing
I want to stay this way forever
If you don't mind
Whatever I say
Whatever I say
I don't really want to change a thing
I want to stay this way forever
You know it will be with you
But don't give up on me yet
Don't think I'm walking out of this
She don't mind
Whatever I say
Whatever I say
I don't really want to change a thing
I want to stay this way forever
If you don't mind
Whatever I say
Whatever I say
I don't really want to change a thing
I want to stay this way 
Forever
You know it's to be with you
