<song artist="Blur" title="To_The_End_(La_ComĂŠdie)">
All those dirty words (jusqu'à la fin)
They make us look so dumb (en plein soleil)
Been drinking far too much (jusqu'à la fin)
And neither of us mean what we say (en plein amour)
Well, you and I
Collapsed in love
And it looks like we might have made it
Yes, it looks like we've made it to the end
What happened to us? (jusqu'à la fin)
Soon it will be gone forever (en plein soleil)
Infatuated only with ourselves (jusqu'à la fin)
And neither of us can think straight anymore (en plein amour)
Well, you and I
Collapsed in love
And it looks like we might have made it
Yes, it looks like we've made it to the end
When you and I
Collapsed in Love
Well, it looks like we might have made it
Yes, it looks like we've made it to the end
(En plein amour)
You and I, we just
Collapsed in love
And it looks like we might have made it
Yes it looks like we've made it to the end
(En plein soleil)
