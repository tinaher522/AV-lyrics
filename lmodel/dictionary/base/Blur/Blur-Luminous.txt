<song artist="Blur" title="Luminous">
Don't look at me as
Your only regret what you don't see
You know more than I
So think for me
Think what your not
Ah ah ah ah
Love substitute for the
Never knew who you were
Half your life has been explained
You want the other half
Ah ah ah ah 
Don't look at me as though I'm not here
Your only regret what you don't see
Half my life has been explained
