<song artist="Blur" title="Chinese_Bombs">
He makes an inner arm block then kicks from behind
The lights, they go off but he can fight blind
'Cause he got the touch and he will live long
He comes from Hong Kong where justice is done
Chinese bombs, millions jump
Chairman's junk, USA
Won't somebody, won't somebody
Sink the place
Got a call to go to Soho, the dragon said go
Let everyone know that you got the touch
You come from Hong Kong where justice is done
Where people are strong and you will live long
Chinese bombs, millions jump
Chairman's junk, USA
Bruce Lee come, save the day
Bruce Lee come, the Chinese way
