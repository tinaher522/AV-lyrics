<song artist="Blur" title="I_Love_Her">
I look at her
Just to see
Is there anyone out there
For me
If you look at her
Do you see
Is there anything in there
For me
I love her
I love, love her
She don’t care if I live or die
That is why I love her
So don’t talk to me
Don’t talk to me
There’s so little I can say when i feel this way
So don’t talk to me
Don’t talk to me
There’s very little I can say when i feel this way
I love her
I love, love her
She don’t care if I live or die
That is why I love her
I love, love her
She don’t care if I live or die
That is why I love her...
I love her, I love love her
She don’t care if I live or die
That is why I love her
I love, love her
She don’t care if I live or die
That is why...
I love her
I love her
I love her
I love her
