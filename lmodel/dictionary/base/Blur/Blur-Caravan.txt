<song artist="Blur" title="Caravan">
Caravan is lost
In the sun and the dust
No-one loves you
When you are lost
Yeah I've been a clown
Trying to pull my whole world down
I believed I was strong
And when it comes you'll feel
the weight of it
the weight of it
And the day will come when you'll
get away from it
Sometimes everything is easy
Sometimes everything is easy
I tried to quit
But my heart won't buy it
I got family
The caravan came back for me
And when it comes you'll feel the 
weight of it
The weight of it
And the day will come when you'll 
get away from it
Away from it
Sometimes everything is easy
Sometimes everything is easy
