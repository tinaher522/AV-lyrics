<song artist="Blur" title="Headist-Into_Another">
It starts feeling now 
It still won't see it's his 
It makes no inference of difference 
Faint from lack of air 
It makes a whistle with a twistle 
But no one can hear 
As long as I could 
Didn't stay long 
I had to go away to stay 
So I'm happy here 
Cause here is where the heart is
You and me 
I know you think that too 
Into another 
Am I dead 
Into another
Sleep in Harlow's bed
Sleep in Harlow's bed
Listening to our tune 
Am I dead
I can read your lips 
With headphone and volume on 
And in a clinical term I've heard it said 
"Everything is beautiful, but nothing hurt" 
Into another 
Am I dead 
Into another
You and me 
You and me
Sleep in Harlow's bed
Sleep in Harlow's bed
Am I dead
