<song artist="Blur" title="The_Universal">
This is the next century
Where the universal's free
You can find it anywhere
Yes, the future's been sold
Every night we're gone
And to Karaoke songs
How we like to sing along
Though the words are wrong
It really really really could happen
Yes it really really really could happen
When the days they seem to fall through you
Well, just let them go
No one here is alone
Satellites in every home
Yes, the universal's here
Here for everyone
Every paper that you read
Says tomorrow's your lucky day
Well here's your lucky day
It really really really could happen
Yes it  really really really could happen
When the days they seem to fall through you
Just let them go
Well, it really really really could happen
Yes, it really really really could happen
When the days they seem to fall through you
Just let them go
Just let them go
Just let them go
