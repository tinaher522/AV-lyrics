<song artist="Blur" title="Daisy_Bell">
There is a flower within my heart
Daisy, Daisy
Planted one day by a glancing dart
Planted by Daisy Bell
Whether she loves me or loves me not
Sometimes it's hard to tell
Yet I am longing to share the lot
Of beautiful Daisy Bell
Daisy, Daisy, give me your answer, do
I'm half crazy all for the love of you
It won't be a stylish marriage
I can't afford the carriage
But you'd look sweet upon the seat
Of a bicycle built for two
We will go tandem as man and wife
Daisy, Daisy
Peddling our way down the road of life
I and my Daisy Bell
When the night's dark we can both despise
Policemen and lamps as well.
There are bright lights in the dazzling eyes
Of beautiful Daisy Bell.
Daisy, Daisy, give me your answer, do
I'm half crazy all for the love of you
It won't be a stylish marriage
I can't afford the carriage
But you'd look sweet on the seat
Of a bicycle built for two
I will stand by you in wheel or woe
Daisy, Daisy,
You'll be the bell which I'll ring you know
Sweet little Daisy Bell
You'll take the lead on each trip we take
Then if I don't do well
I will permit you to use the brake
Beautiful Daisy Bell
Daisy, Daisy, give me your answer, do
I'm half crazy all for the love of you
It won't be a stylish marraige
I can't afford the carriage
But you'd look sweet on the seat
Of a bicycle built for two
But you'd look sweet on the seat
Of a bicycle built for two
Of a bicycle built for two
Of a bicycle built for two
For two, For two, For two, For two
