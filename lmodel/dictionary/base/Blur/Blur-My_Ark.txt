<song artist="Blur" title="My_Ark">
Please excuse my tendancy to colour everything I tell you
You don't understand it takes me wherever I want to go
This is showing what I mean but I don't know a thing that way
And in the end
I can't help feeling that (?)
I've got time to build you up so tall you won't fall down on me
I've got time to build you up so tall you won't fall down on me
Down on me
Please excuse my tendancy to colour everything I tell you
But in my mind there's nothing that really ever holds us from the truth
So I build my eye and I have you do the same for me
In the end, I can't help feeling just to (?)
I've got time to build you up so tall you won't fall down on me
I've got time to build you up so tall you won't fall down on me
Down on me
I've got time to build you up so tall you won't fall down on me
I've got time to build you up so tall you won't fall down on me
I've got time to build you up so tall you won't fall down on me
I've got time to build you up so tall you won't fall down on me
Down on me
