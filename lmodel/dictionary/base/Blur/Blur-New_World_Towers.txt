<song artist="Blur" title="New_World_Towers">
Green, green, the neon green, new world towers
Carved out of grey white skies, twenty-four hours
I glide through the glass arcades to Hollywood
The psycho pomp, it leads me dreaming of
Love, love, so far away, new world towers
Log in your name and pray, twenty-four hours
Green turns to red and blue and time relates
To all again and sleep the rescue
Green, green, the neon green new world towers
Plane flying overhead satellite showers
Fall like confetti on the cavalcade
The flashboat sea, all auguries, reflected in you
Seven on me
Seven on a left hand
Seven on me
Seven on me
Love, love, so far away, new world towers
Carved out of grey white sky, twenty-four hours
Green turns to red and blue and time relates
The flashboat sea, all auguries, reflected in you
Seven on me
Seven on a left hand
Seven on me
Seven on me
Seven on me
Seven on me
Seven on a left hand
Seven on me
