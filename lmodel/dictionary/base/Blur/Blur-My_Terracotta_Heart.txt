<song artist="Blur" title="My_Terracotta_Heart">
And the bright rays
We got in summertime
Seemed like a breath of fresh air
Back in the summertime
When we were more like brothers
But that was years ago
So if it doesn't seem like a protocol
I'm running out of heart today
I'm running out of open road to you and I know
You are emoting and you're dazed
Is there something broke inside you
'Cause at the moment I'm lost and feeling that I don't know
If I'm losing you again
And when we fly tomorrow
Over the Java seas
And my younger maps
Will be there with me
'Cause they remind me of swimming
Out too far one day
Then the coral was gone, but I didn't care anyway
I was running out of heart that day
I was running out of open road to you and I know
I was emoted, I was dazed
Is there something broke inside me
'Cause at the moment I'm lost and feeling that I don't know
If I'm losing you again
I'm running out of heart today
Just sitting out the constant doubt in my head
But I don't know what it is
I'm sweating out the toxins
Is my terracotta heart breaking? I don't know
If I'm losing you
If I'm losing you again
