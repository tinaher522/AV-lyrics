<song artist="Blur" title="No_Distance_Left_To_Run">
It's over
You don't have to tell me
I hope you're with someone
Who makes you feel safe in your sleep
Being tonight
I won't kill myself trying to stay in your life
I got no distance left to run
When you see me
Please turn your back and walk away
I don't want to see you
'Cause I know the dreams that you keep
That's where we meet
When you're coming down think of me
I got no distance left to run
It's over
I knew it would end this way
I hope you're with someone
Who makes you feel that this life is a life
One that settles down stays around
Spends more time with you
I got no distance left to run
I'm coming home
So cold
Home
