<song artist="Blur" title="Thought_I_Was_A_Spaceman">
Thought I was a spaceman
Digging out my heart
In some distant sand dunes
In a car park
'Cause the desert had encroached upon
The places where we lived
People like me fight
To keep the demons in
But we never succeeded
We never succeeded
In fact we failed
Thought I was a spaceman
Digging out my heart
In some distant sand dunes
In a car park
By the empty harbour
Where the junk boat phantoms float
The fight for happy valley
Sadly, the line broke
Thought I found my black box
Washed up on the shore
On outlying islands
Past the land fall
Thought I thought I'd found it
But that was not true at all
I'd walked into a bar
Raised hell
Cut the chasm out me
Always and always the same
Put the ghost in writing
And let it be
You again
Thought I was a spaceman
Digging out my heart
In some distant sand dune
In Hyde Park
Thought I was a spaceman
Digging out my heart
In some distant sand dune
You again (x2)
You again (x2)
