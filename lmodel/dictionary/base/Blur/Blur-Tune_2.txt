<song artist="Blur" title="Tune_2">
I got my head checked
By a jumbo jet
It wasn't easy
But nothing is, no
When I feel heavy metal
And I'm pins and I'm needles
When I'm lying I'm easy
All of the time
But I'm never sure
Why I need you
Pleased to meet you
I've got my head down
When I was young
It's not my problem
It's not my problem
When I feel heavy metal
And I'm pins and I'm needles
When I'm lying I'm easy
All of the time
But I'm never sure
Why I need you
Pleased to meet you
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Oh yeah.
