<song artist="Blur" title="Maggie_May">
Wake up Maggie, I think I've got something to say to you
It's late September and I really should be back at school
I know I keep you amused but I feel I'm being used
O Maggie I couldn't have tried any more
You led me away from home
Just to save you from being alone
You stole my heart
That's what really hurts
All I needed was a friend of lend a guiding hand
You turned into my lover and, mother, what a lover you wore me out
All you do is wreck my bed and in the morning kick me in the head
Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried anymore
You led me away from home
Just to save you from being alone
You stole my heart 
I couldn't leave you if I tried
I suppose I could collect my books and go back to school
Or steal my daddy's cue and make a living out of playing pool
I'll find myself a rock n roll band that needs a helping hand
Maggie I wish I'd never seen your face
You made a first class fool out of me
But I was blind as a fool can be
You stole my heart but I love you anyway
