<song artist="Blur" title="Ghost_Ship">
I remember flashbacks lighting up magic whip
Eight o'clock, Kowloon emptiness, handle it
The white horse image I had of you eleven seconds ago
I didn't send you, so you will never know
I got away for a little while
But then it came back much harder
Swinging on a cable up to Po Lin
Climbing panda ghostly wine, battery
That light in your eyes I search for religiously
When it's not there, oh Lord, it's hurting me
I got away for a little while
But then it came back much harder
Till I ever hold you out there again, will you be mine?
'Cause I'm on a ghost ship drowning my heart in Hong Kong
It's the last ride boarding here tonight out in the bay
I'll need a lantern in you to shine out bright rays
Feeling out of body here, what can I do?
It's out to the dock everyday to join with you
I had to get away for a little while
But then it came back much harder
Till I ever hold you out there again, will you be mine?
'Cause I'm on a ghost ship drowning my heart in Hong Kong
It's the last ride boarding here tonight out in the bay
I'll need a lantern in you to shine out bright rays
Till I ever hold you out there again, will you be mine?
'Cause I'm on a ghost ship drowning my heart in Hong Kong
It's the last ride boarding here tonight out in the bay
I'll need a lantern in you to shine out bright rays
Bright rays
Bright rays
