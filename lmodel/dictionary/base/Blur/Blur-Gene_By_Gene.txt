<song artist="Blur" title="Gene_By_Gene">
I got a brain it's a left-hand drive
I don't asleep, other side
I ride a bullet like I'm Steve McQueen
Each town, I intervene
A gram of keef and the barn is jumping
It's alright, we got time
Got a radio hit in mind
Can't see, am I blind?
Every night and day, I'll never forget
In the U.S.A., I delete myself 
Got to get to know you gene by gene 
You're my, jellybean 
Get out the shower 'round four fifteen 
And I'm dead, when I'm clean 
Fatboy and the barn is pumping 
It's alright, it's just tight 
Got to get into a better business 
Deep down, happiness
Every night and day, I'll never forget
In the U.S.A., I delete myself
