<song artist="Blur" title="All_We_Want">
Give me gas, if it gets too much
Not an uncommon thing, everyone does as such
Here we go, upon all fours
Got bright ideas, on how to win wars
All we want, all we ever want
Is to feel something, but I just say nothing
All we want, all anybody wants
Is to feel something, but I just feel nothing
Another episode, just got binned
Next weeks repeat, sees me living in
In consequence, vitality
Struck hidden eyes, it's all over me
All we want, all we ever want
Is to feel something, but I just say nothing
All we want, all anybody wants
Is to feel something, but I just feel nothing
Is to feel something, but I just feel nothing
