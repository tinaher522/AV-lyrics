<song artist="Blur" title="Badhead">
So far, I've not really stayed in touch
Well, you knew as much, it's no surprise
That today, I'll get up around two
From a lack of anything to do
And I might as well just grin and bear it
'Cause it's not worth the trouble of an argument
And you've not really stayed in touch
Well, I knew as much, it's no surprise
That today, I get up around two
With nothing to do except get a touch of flu
And I might as well just grin and bear it
'Cause it's not worth the trouble of an argument
And in any case I'd rather wear it
It's like a badhead in the morning
And I know
And I might as well just grin and bear it
'Cause it's not worth the trouble of an argument
And in any case I'd rather wear it
It's like a badhead in the morning
So I might as well just grin and bear it
'Cause it's not worth the trouble of an argument
And in any case I'd rather wear it
You're like a badhead in the morning
And I know
