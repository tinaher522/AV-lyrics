<song artist="Blur" title="Outsider">
I got something on my ego
The plastic surgery will melt
Its like getting kinda me so
It comes over when you come
I need to call it out my system
I find the good and kick it out
When the wind blows the stars don't shine
I find the good and kick it out
I got day day day day day day day today
The error takes some parts so stay away
I find myself alone
Just staring down the phone
I got day day day day day day day today
I see shadows in the night grow
I see dancing disease
I don't fear very easily
I gotta get some light relief
I got day day day day day day day today
The error takes some parts so stay away
I find myself alone
Just staring down the phone
I got day day day day day day day today
Alone, alone, alone, alone
I got day day day day day day day today
The error takes some parts so stay away
I find myself alone
Just staring down the phone
I got day day day day day day day today
