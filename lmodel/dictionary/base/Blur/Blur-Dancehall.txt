<song artist="Blur" title="Dancehall">
There are ghosts in here
An easy laze
They dance all night
With a vacant gaze
They stand in rows
And buy alcohol
We're having fun at the dancehall
I've got my pills and I've got my toys
Pin-up girls and pin-up boys
My lips are frozen
I could kill him, but I just kiss his hand
