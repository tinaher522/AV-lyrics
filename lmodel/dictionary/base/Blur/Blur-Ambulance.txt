<song artist="Blur" title="Ambulance">
I ain't got
Nothing to be scared of, no
No I ain't got
Nothing to be scared of, no
No I ain't got
Anything to be scared of, no
'Cos I love you
I was born out of love
It's the only way to come into this world
I know I'm not all there
But I'm getting, getting, getting there
If you let me live my life
I'll stay with you to the end
And I know, lord
I'm nearly there
On the surface
I ain't got
Nothing to be scared of, no
No I ain't got
Nothing to be scared of, no
No I ain't got
Anything to be scared of, no
'Cos I love you
No I ain't got
Nothing to be scared of, no
No I ain't got
Nothing to be scared of, no
