<song artist="Blur" title="Young_And_Lovely">
Friday's child is planning to go out
for the first time
Says "Don't worry mum
I won't be out that late"
Done me playing those passive games right now
they're out of date
You're awfully sweet
Haven't got the time
growing up so fast  
Got better things to do
You can get what you want
you're so young and lovely ah,ah,ah,la,la,la (2)
Kicking around in the centre of the town
looking in shop windows
Those mannequins 
look far too real at night
Friday's child doesn't know if it's awake
or if it's dreaming
Says" Don't worry dad
I'll do my bit, I'll raise the flag, I'll be just like you"
You can get what you want
you're so young and lovely ah,ah,ah,la,la,la(2)
Don't worry mum
I'm not that dumb, I'll be just like you.
You can get what you want
You're so young and lovely ah,ah,ah,la,la,la
Oh,no, why
Why'd you do it?
Why you're so
la,la,la
