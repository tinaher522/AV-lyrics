<song artist="Blur" title="Clover_Over_Dover">
I'm on the white cliffs of Dover
Thinking it over and over
But if I jump it's all over
A cautionary tale for you
I'd like to roll in the clover
With you over and over
On the white cliffs of Dover
And then I'd let you push me over
If that is the fact
Then in actual fact
It's not where it's at
And it's over
If that is the fact
Then in actual fact
I'm not where it's at
It's all over
Yes, it is
And now the bluebirds are over
Over the white cliffs of Dover
And when you push me over
Don't bury me, I'm not worth anything
If that is the fact
Then in actual fact
It's not where it's at
And it's over
If that is the fact
Then in actual fact
I'm not where it's at
It's all over
Yes, it is
