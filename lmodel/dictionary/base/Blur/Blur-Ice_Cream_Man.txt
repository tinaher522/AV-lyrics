<song artist="Blur" title="Ice_Cream_Man">
Here comes the ice cream man
Parked at the end of the road
With a swish of his magic whip
All the people in the party froze
Screwball, chocolate chip,
Umbrella in his white glove hand
Shade from the sun was his intention
Here comes the ice cream man
Bouncing up the hill
With a wick, the pumpkin lit
Happy valley cones he fills
For all the lantern men
Marching down till dawn
Morning come we fall over
Something you
Something new
Something you
Here comes the ice cream man
Parked at the end of the road
With a swish of his magic whip
All the people in the party froze
I was only twenty-one
When I watched it on TV
I was racing in my heart back then
Something you
Something new
Something you
Something new (something you knew nothing about)
Something new
Something you
Here comes the ice cream man
Out with his magic whip
Always sold out by nine
So you better come and get it quick
