<song artist="Blur" title="One_Born_Every_Minute">
Here we go (Here we go) here we go again
Dirty knickers pop music vodka and gin
Your knees are sore you must've been in the wars
There's something to celebrate in our lives and
Here's where it begins
Oh well see how we've grown
One gets born every minute
You're never never alone
One gets born - every minute of the day
Dosey clocks to cause the volitile tots to
Sleep together if or never we're on this then
Oh here we go, here we go, here we go again
Dirty knickers pop music vodka beer and gin
Oh well see how we've grown
One gets born every minute
You're never never alone
One gets born - every minute of the day
