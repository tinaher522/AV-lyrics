<song artist="Blur" title="Fool's_Day">
Wake up straight
Caught out by the sun
On the first day of April
Out of bed
Thought it was a plane crash
But I'm sure that I was dreaming
TV on
Of course caffeine, a science
Of submission again
Another day on this little island
Just a bell hangs on
Porridge done
I take my kid to school
Paced the pound shop, Woolworth's
Under bridge
Where the subway sees the daytime
And the Westway flies by
Then on my bike
Down the Ladbroke Grove
To the forthcoming dramas
A studio
And a love of all sweet music
We just can't let go
(Let go, let go, let go, let go)
So meditate
On what we've all become
On a cold day in springtime
Civil war
Is what we were all born into
Raise your left hand, right, sing
Don't capitulate to the forces of the market place
They're long departed
Consolidate the love we have together
On a cold day in springtime
