<song artist="Blur" title="1992">
Going to business
An agreement of your bombast
You'd love my bed
You took the other instead
But don't you feel low
I was being oblique
And you'd love my bed
You got the other instead
What do you owe me?
The price of your piece of mind
You'd love my bed
You took it all instead
