<song artist="Blur" title="Maggie_May_-_Previously_Unreleased">
Wake up, Maggie
I think I've got something to say to you
It's late September
And I really should be back at school
I know I keep you amused
But I feel I'm being used
O Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more
You led me away from home
Just to save you from being alone
You stole my heart
That's what really hurts
All I needed was a friend of lend, a guiding hand
You turned into my lover
And mother, what a lover, you wore me out
All you do is wreck my bed
And in the morning kick me in the head
O Maggie, I couldn't have tried anymore
You led me away form home
Just to save you from being alone
You stole my heart
I couldn't leave you if I tried
I suppose I could collect my books
And go back to school or steal my daddy's cue
And make a living out of playing pool
I'll find myself a rock 'n' roll band
That needs a helping hand
Maggie, I wish I'd never seen your face
You made a first class fool out of me
But I was blind as a fool can be
You stole my heart
But I love you anyway
