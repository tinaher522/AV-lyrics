<song artist="Blur" title="Pressure_On_Julian">
Only the magical transit children sing, sing the lullaby bah, bah, bah,
Sitting on the pavement sucking on a long straw, it's colorful,
It's colorful, but it washes you out
Here is my violence and here is the excuse,
I learned it all but only second hand
Falling into walls well, what is it with you,
you'd never know never know, never know
We planned it all this way, we planned it all this way
Pressure on Julian
Swimming in yellow pissy water, sand getting in between the ears,
No blood in head in this bloody weather, irate people with
Yellow tongues
Only the magical transit children sing, sing lullaby bah, bah, bah
Falling into walls, well what is it with you, you'd never know
Never know, never know.
(OVERVOICE) There was pressure on Julian, pushing trolleys in the car park from b to a then back to b, pressure on Julian, he keeps passing out, poor little snout, the birds are singing at night, pressure on Julian
Falling into walls well, what is it with you, you'd never know,
Never know, never know
There was pressure on Julian, pushing trolleys in the car park from b to a then back to b, pressure on Julian, he keeps passing out, poor little snout, the birds are singing at night, pressure on Julian
