<song artist="Blur" title="Stereotypes">
The suburbs they are dreaming
They're a twinkle in her eye
She's been feeling frisky
Since her husband said goodbye
She wears a low-cut T-shirt
Runs a little B&amp;B
She's most accommodating
When she's in her lingerie
Wife swapping is your future
You know that it would suit ya
Yes, the stereotypes, there must be more to life
All your life you're dreaming and when you stop dreaming
From time to time you know
You should be going on another bender
The suburbs they are sleeping
But she's dressing up tonight
She likes a man in uniform
He likes to wear it tight
They're on the lover's sofa
They're on the patio
And when the fun is over
Watch themselves on video
The neighbours may be staring
But they just lost caring
Yes, the stereotypes, there must be more to life
All your life you're dreaming and when you stop dreaming
From time to time you know
You're going on another bender
Yes, there must be more to life than stereotypes
Wife swapping is your future
You know that it would suit ya
Yes, the stereotypes, there must be more to life
All your life you're dreaming and when you stop dreaming
From time to time you know
You should be going on another bender
Yes, there must be more to life than stereotypes
All your life you're dreaming and when you stop dreaming
From time to time you know
You should go on another bender
If for you come to offend her
