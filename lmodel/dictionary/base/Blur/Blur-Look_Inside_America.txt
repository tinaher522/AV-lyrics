<song artist="Blur" title="Look_Inside_America">
Good morning lethargy
Drink pepsi is good for energy
The bath's on, smoke in the bedroom
Sore throat and on my neck a nasty bruise
Where it came from, well I don't know
But we played last night, it was a good show
Got the play out on a second rate chatshow
It's a nationwide deal, so we gotta go
Chuck from the company says it'll be alright
Got an ad on K-ROQ and there's an instore tonight
Well I build things up, then I let them go
Got to get timeshare on the radio
Look inside America, she's alright, she's alright
Sitting out in the distance but I'm not trying to make up her mind
Looking for America with its kookie nights and suicide
Where the TV says it's alright 'cause everybody's hung up on something or other
"Steppin' off in 20" so the driver says
I should sleep tonight but I think I'll watch videos instead
Annie Hall leaves New York in the end
Press rewind and Woody gets her back again
And the whole world could have passed through me
But I don't know if it means that much to me
Look inside America, she's alright, she's alright
Sitting out in the distance but I'm not trying to make up her mind
Looking for America with its kookie nights and suicide
The TV says it's alright 'cause everybody's strung out on something or other
And the whole world could have passed through me
But I don't know if it means that much to me
