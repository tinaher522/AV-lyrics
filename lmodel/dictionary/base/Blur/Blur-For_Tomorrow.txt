<song artist="Blur" title="For_Tomorrow">
He's a twentieth century boy 
With his hands on the rails 
Trying not to be sick again 
And holding on for tomorrow 
London ice cracks on a seamless line 
He's hanging on for dear life 
So we hold each other tightly 
And hold on for tomorrow 
Singing 
La la, la la la 
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
Holding on for tomorrow 
Ohoho...
She's a twentieth century girl 
With her hands on the wheel 
Trying not to make him sick again 
Seeing what she can borrow 
London's so nice back in your seamless rhymes 
But we're lost on the Westway 
So we hold each other tightly 
And we can wait until tomorrow 
Singing la la, la la la 
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la 
Holding on for tomorrow 
We're trying not to be sick again 
And holding for tomorrow 
She's a twentieth century girl 
Hanging on for dear life 
So we hold each other tightly 
And hold on for tomorrow 
Singing la la, la la la 
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
Holding on for tomorrow 
Jim stops and gets out the car
Goes to a house in Emperor's gate
Through the door and to his room 
Then he puts the TV on
Turns it off and makes some tea
Says "Modern life, well, it's rubbish"
I'm holding on for tomorrow
Then Susan comes into the room
She's a naughty girl with a lovely smile
Says: "Let's take a drive to Primrose Hill
It's windy there and the view's so nice"
London ice can freeze your toes 
Like anyone I suppose 
I'm holding on for tomorrow
