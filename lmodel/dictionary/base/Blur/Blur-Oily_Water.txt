<song artist="Blur" title="Oily_Water">
Lead in me and me in water
Dangling in my word
I swallowed too much oily water
It keeps slipping down my spine
In a sense of self decline
Growing fat on sound
It's only an early morning dream
And the whole world will be alright
My head is full of suspicion
I'm coming home sometime
I've swallowed too much oily water
It keeps slipping down my spine
In a sense of self in decline
Lying on my back
It's only an early morning dream
And so the whole world will be alright
