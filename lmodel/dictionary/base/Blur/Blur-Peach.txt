Chemical Eats
Best part of the peach
You're always the way you are
What of that going to close you in
You got a gaping hole in your head
Id let the birds nest there instead
Aha aha aha aha
A gun in your pocket
And hair in a locket
Around your neck
From the girl you once loved
where is she now, you've gone crazy
You've got a gaping hole in your head
I'd let the birds nest there instead
Aha aha aha aha 
You've got a gaping hole in your head
I'd let the birds nest there instead
I'd let the birds nest there instead
I'd let the birds nest there instead
I'd let the birds nest there instead
Aha aha aha aha
