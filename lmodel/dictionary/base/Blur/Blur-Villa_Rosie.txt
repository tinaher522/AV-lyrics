<song artist="Blur" title="Villa_Rosie">
Practice doesn't make perfect when you're interbreeding
Speaking drivel can it get confused with heavy breathing
Mixing drinks at water holes get snarled up in the suburbs
Meandering through this and that you are suspected of vagueness
When work is done, go to Villa Rosie every night (we're waiting)
So form a queue at villa Rosie every night (so tasty)
Across the common every day you come across the fine line
But wearing boots can prevent the leeches in the long grass
Eating between meals stifles the appetite is it healthy
Coming home that nagging doubt there in your belly
And all the while at villa Rosie every night (we're tasting)
A sweeter life at Villa Rosie every night (so tasty)
All losers come to Villa Rosie every night (we're waiting)
So form a queue at Villa Rosie every night (so tasty)
Don't break your back at Villa Rosie every night (we're tasting)
A sweeter life at Villa Rosie every night (so tasty)
