<song artist="Blur" title="Mellow_Song">
I left my street
I'm a guillotine
Pull it away
In my machine
Where have I been now?
Not you
Shooting stars in my left arm
It's an alcohol low
Giving away time to Casio
Sun is low
God so
Is this where I'm going to?
We'll see
We'll see
We'll see
I kill this sleep
I'm the man in the moon
Walking on sand
On my home high noon
In love with the moon
I love you
'Cause I left my street
I'm a guillotine
Pull it away
In my machine
Forget where I've been
I forget you
Is this where I'm going to?
We'll see
We'll see
We'll see
