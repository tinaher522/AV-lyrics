La la la
La la la
La la la...
I got on a boat on a hot sunny day
To get out of this town
Cause the tarmac was melting and the people seemed to sway
Stuck in the underground
To the islands, the black kites, the wishing tree
I wanna be with you
On the slow boat to Lan Tao, the misty seas
I wanna be with you
I crawled out the harbour with recession behind
And I'm feeling the love of you
So you better get a charge 'til I see you again
You know just what to do
If you're caught up in the gales on the junk boat seas
I wanna be with you
With the pilgrims, the mountains, the high trapeze
I wanna be with you
If you're a landlord, the social on BST
I wanna be with you
On an island with red kites and verdant seas
I will be there with you
La la la
La la la
La la la...
I wanna be with you
La la la
La la la
La la la...
I wanna be with you
