<song artist="Blur" title="Come_Together">
I don't understand
You're walking over me
All over me
To you
You must be mad
And you know you are
You should have known
I'd do anything for you
So, why, why
Can't we come together
Why?
Inside my head
There's nothing left
It's all been taken out
By you
And do I care
Well, you know I do
You should have known
I'd do anything for you
So, why, why
Can't we come together
Why?
Now it's all been said
And you know it all
Then you should have known
I'd do anything for you
For you
