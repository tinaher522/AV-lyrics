<song artist="Blur" title="B.L.U.R.E.M.I.">
Group using a loop
Of another pop group
Group shooting a hoop
And starving it up into the soup
'Cause I'm of regular features
And Adidas trainers
Completing the cycle
Until the teenage maniacs can bring it on back
B-L-U-R-E-M-I
Group using a loop
Of another pop group
Completing the cycle
Until the teenage maniacs they'll bring it all back
They'll bring it all back
B-L-U-R-E-M-I
