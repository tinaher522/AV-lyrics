One night, half a dozen tourists met together in Trafalgar Square
A fortnight's tour on the continent was planned
And each had his portmanteau in his hand
Down the Rhine they meant to have a picnic
Till Jones said I must decline
You boys have been advised by me
Stay away from Germany
What's the good of going down the Rhine? 
Let's all go down the Strand
Let's all go down the Strand
I'll be leader, you can march behind
Come with me and see what you can find
Let's all go down the Strand
Oh what a happy land
That's the place for fun and noise
All among the girls and boys
So let's all go down the Strand 
One day 5 and 20 convicts
Sat in 5 and 20 little cells
The bell then sounded ding-a-ding-a-dong
To exercise the prisoners came along
Burglar Ben exclaimed to Jaggs the Warden
To me sir, it's very strange
The men are tired of going round
Round and round the same old ground
I propose we make a little change 
Let's all go down the Strand
Let's all go down the Strand
I'll be leader, you can march behind
Come with me and see what we can find
Let's all go down the Strand
Oh what a happy land
That's the place for fun and noise
All among the girls and boys
So let's all go down the Strand 
Great crowds gathered round to welcome
Shackleton returning from the Pole
The Lord Mayor welcomed all the gallant crew
And said my lads, I've got a treat for you
Come with me, the Mansion House awaits you
A banquet shall be supplied
But a Tar in grumbling mood
Said we don't want any food
Then he turned to Shackleton and sighed
Let's all go down the Strand
Let's all go down the Strand
I'll be leader, you can march behind
Come with me and see what you can find
Let's all go down the Strand
Oh what a happy land
That's the place for fun and noise
All among the girls and boys
So let's all go down the Strand 
Let's all go down the Strand
Let's all go down the Strand
I'll be leader, you can march behind
Come with me and see what you can find
Let's all go down the Strand
Oh what a happy land
That's the place for fun and noise
All among the girls and boys
So let's all go down the Strand
