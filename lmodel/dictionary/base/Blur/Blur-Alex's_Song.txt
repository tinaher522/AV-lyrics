<song artist="Blur" title="Alex's_Song">
Picked up the girl
And he sailed around the world
Why not?
What else have you got?
If you're not anyone that I like
Love will give me the moon
Whoops 
And beyond these voices
And danced on the groove
In a dream forever starts when you wake up
Starts when you wake up
Picked up the girl
And he sailed around the world
(What, oh yeah, sorry)
Around the world
Why not?
What else has he got?
I don't know
And I know I don't know
Love will give me the moon
(Oh dear)
And beyond these voices
And danced on the groove
In a dream forever starts when you wake up
Starts when you wake up
