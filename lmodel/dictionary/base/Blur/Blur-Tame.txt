Disguise this morning
Airplane passes
At this light angle
Second one follows
Reaching no evidence
Continues to baffle her
But she's not stupid
She's just friendly
I don't know what to do
Today is up to you
Can I pass through you?

Tame
Applause in background
Their coffee mornings
The show Bonanza's and
What to buy there
So taste of horrors
Oh well city's hot
You fall to pieces well
I must be dreaming I don't know what to do
Today is up to you
Can I pass through you?
And I don't know what to do
My absence is due
Can I pass, can I?

I don't know what to do
Today is up to you
Can I pass through you?
And I don't know what to do
My absence is due
Can I pass through you?
