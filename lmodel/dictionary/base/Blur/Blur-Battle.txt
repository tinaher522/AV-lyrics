<song artist="Blur" title="Battle">
Battle battle battle battle battle
Battle someone
Ooh
Completion Serch
Here I love the blow
See me walk on down to
Adorn myself
It's a glory
'Cause see me
What do you think of now?
Battle battle battle battle battle
Battle someone
Ooh
Can turn your sights
Kill until sub-zero
See me
Oh it turns you on
All my awe
It's the end of your
Take your last one now
Battle battle battle battle battle
Battle someone
Ooh
