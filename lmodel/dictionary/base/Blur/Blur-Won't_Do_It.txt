<song artist="Blur" title="Won't_Do_It">
So much to be and so much to see
There's very little here for me
It's really hard to get through
So won't do it anymore
Don't feel it anymore
Won't do it anymore
Can't feel it 
There's so much I'd like to say
You're not bothered either way
It's really hard to talk to you
So won't do it anymore
Don't do it anymore
Won't do it anymore
Can't feel it
So won't do it anymore
Don't feel it anymore
Won't do it anymore
Can't feel it 
So won't do it anymore
Don't feel it anymore
Won't do it anymore
Can't feel it anymore
So won't do it anymore
Don't feel it anymore
Won't do it anymore
Can't feel it
