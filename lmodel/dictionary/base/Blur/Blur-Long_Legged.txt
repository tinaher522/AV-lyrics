<song artist="Blur" title="Long_Legged">
You know you do not lean before me
You're just in my head dear can't you see
I don't want to be with you anymore
You're just a head dear oh no
I look at me long legged me
I look at me foolish me
I'm crawling on the floor again
I'm trying to find my head again
Oh you really don't understand do you?
No you have not got a fucking clue
It's not that I don't like you it's not that way
It's just that I don't understand
The change, it's strange, the change, it's strange
I look at me long legged me
I look at me foolish me
I'm crawling on the floor again
I'm trying to find my head again
Yie!
Yie!
Yie!
Yie!
Yie!
Yie!
Yie!
Yie!
Yie!
Yie!
Yie!
Yie!
Yie!
Yie!
