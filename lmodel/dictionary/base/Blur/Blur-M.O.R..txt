<song artist="Blur" title="M.O.R.">
It's automatic (It's automatic)
I need to unload (Need to unload)
Under the pressure (Under the pressure)
Go middle of the road (Middle of the road)
Fall into fashion (Fall into fashion)
Fall out again (Fall out again)
We stick together (We stick together)
'Cause it never ends (It never ends)
Here comes a low (I'm a boy and you're a girl)
Here comes a high (The only ones in the world)
Here comes everything (You and me, we'll work it out)
Here it comes, you, me, we'll work it out
Here comes tomorrow (Here comes tomorrow)
One, two, three episodes (Three episodes)
We stick together (We stick together)
Go middle of the road (Middle of the road)
'Cause that's entertainment (That's entertainment)
It's the sound of the wheel (Sound of the wheel) 
It rolls on forever (Roll, roll forever)
Yeah, you know how it feels (Know how it feels)
Here comes a low (I'm a boy and you're a girl)
Here comes a high (The only ones in the world)
Here comes everything (Like monkeys out in space)
Here it comes (We are members of the human race)
Here comes a low (I'm a boy and you're a girl)
Here comes a high (The only ones in the world)
Here comes everything (You and me, we'll work it out)
Here it comes, you, me, we'll work it out
It's automatic (It's automatic)
I need to unload (Need to unload)
Under the pressure (Under the pressure)
Go middle of the road (Middle of the road)
Here comes a low (I'm a boy and you're a girl)
Here comes a high (The only ones in the world)
Here comes everything (Like monkeys out in space)
Here it comes (We are members of the human race)
Here comes a low (I'm a boy and you're a girl)
Here comes a high (The only ones in the world)
Here comes everything (You and me, we'll work it out)
Here it comes, you, me, we'll work it out
