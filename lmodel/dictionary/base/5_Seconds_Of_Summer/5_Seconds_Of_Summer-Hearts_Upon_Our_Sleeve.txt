<song artist="5_Seconds_Of_Summer" title="Hearts_Upon_Our_Sleeve">
All:
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Luke:
We wear our hearts upon our sleeve
Luke:
There's a part of my heart that you'll never change
Michael:
There's a dream so alive, it's an endless flame
Calum:
And you can't keep us down 'cause we'll always come back again
Luke:
For the highs and the lows, for the rise and falls
Michael:
And the times that you thought you'd give it your all
Calum:
For a night and a dream and those moments you'll never get back again
Michael:
'Cause the world is at our feet
All:
We've been through a thousand heartbreaks
But you know we still believe
We wear the same shirts as our fathers
And our hearts upon our sleeve
Don't stop us now, we've started
'Cause there's no one we can't beat
We wear the same shirts as our fathers
And our hearts upon our sleeve
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Luke:
We wear our hearts upon our sleeve
Calum:
Hear the crowd in the stands and out in the streets
Michael:
Every fan, everywhere on the edge of their seats
Calum:
It's a beautiful day for a beautiful game
Luke:
See the players run out, and the anthems ring
Michael:
And you're singing so hard, you can't hear a thing
Calum:
But the beat of your heart is beating you up again
Michael:
'Cause the world is at our feet
All:
We've been through a thousand heartbreaks
But you know we still believe
We wear the same shirts as our fathers
And our hearts upon our sleeve
Don't stop us now, we've started
'Cause there's no one we can't beat
We wear the same shirts as our fathers
And our hearts upon our sleeve
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Luke:
We wear our hearts upon our sleeve
DJ Scott Mills:
5 Seconds Of Summer, 'til the end of the game
The joy, the heartache, the tension, the pain
The striker shoots, there's a roar from the crowd
They think it's all over, it is now
All:
It's a generic football anthem
To be sung around the world
And we hope it doesn't sound like
Any others that you've heard
Don't stop us now we've started
'Cause there's no one we can't beat
We wear the same shirts as our fathers
And our hearts upon our sleeve
Luke:
We wear our hearts upon our sleeve
