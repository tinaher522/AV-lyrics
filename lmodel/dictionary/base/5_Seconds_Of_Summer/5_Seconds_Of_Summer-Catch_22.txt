You ...
You ...
Luke:
Wasted, I play the same part where I'm chasing your sick little heart
'Til I'm jaded and lying on the floor
Faded, I'm wrapped in your arms while you're waiting to tear me apart
With a last kiss, you leave me wanting more
All:
You, you're a catch 22
Win or lose, I'm screwed
I'm trapped under your spell
It saves me, breaks me 'til I fall back to you
You're a catch 22
You're a catch 22
Calum:
Restless, I stay awake with the spaces
The thought of our hands interlacing, it’s taking over me
Reckless, I'm at your front door and I'm helpless,
I'm twisted back up in the madness, repeating history
Promise me, you'll never let me leave
All:
You, you're a catch 22
Win or lose, I'm screwed
I'm trapped under your spell
It saves me, breaks me 'til I fall back to you
You're a catch 22
You're a catch 22
You're a catch 22 ...
Michael:
Damned if I do, damned if I don’t
Let me go, I'm better off alone 
And here we go again
All:
You, you're a catch 22
Win or lose, I'm screwed
I'm trapped under your spell
It saves me, breaks me 'til I fall back to you
You're a catch 22
Win or lose, I'm screwed
I'm trapped under your spell
It saves me, breaks me 'til I fall back to you
You're a catch 22
Win or lose, I'm screwed
