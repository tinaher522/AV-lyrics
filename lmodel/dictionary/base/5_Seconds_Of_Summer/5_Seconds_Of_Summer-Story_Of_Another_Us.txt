Calum:
Replay the scene over again, 
Before the credits rolling in
Inside my head
I don't recall a single word, 
It hit me faster than I heard
Inside my head
Luke:
And now I'm shaking, wearing thin
I've always wondered where you've been
Tell me if you wanted it at all
All:
I got a long-term plan with short-term fixes
And a wasted heart that just eclipses
And I push my luck and trust the dust enough
That's the story of another us
One last ditch, a new beginning
So take this heart, put yourself in it
This surprise ending I'm depending on
Could be the story of another us
The story of another us
The story of another us
The story of another us
Could be the story of another us
Luke:
Memories are pay-per-view, 
It costs too much to think of you
I'm hanging by a thread
And ever long before we're done, 
I see quick to what we've begun
I'm hanging by a thread
And now before our hope is lost
My heart is here, it's such a cost
Tell me if you wanted it at all
All:
I got a long-term plan with short-term fixes
And a wasted heart that just eclipses
And I push my luck and trust the dust enough
That's the story of another us
One last ditch, a new beginning
So take this heart, put yourself in it
This surprise ending I'm depending on
Could be the story of another us
The story of another us
The story of another us
The story of another us
Could be the story of another us
Michael:
Drowning beside you
Where I'll be to remind you
We're still first in line for
The front row of last resorts
Calum:
One last ditch, a new beginning
So take this heart, put yourself in it
This surprise ending I'm depending on
All:
I got a long-term plan with short-term fixes
And a wasted heart that just eclipses
And I push my luck and trust the dust enough
That's the story of another us
One last ditch, a new beginning
So take this heart, put yourself in it
This surprise ending I'm depending on
Could be the story of another us
The story of another us
The story of another us
The story of another us
Could be the story of another us
