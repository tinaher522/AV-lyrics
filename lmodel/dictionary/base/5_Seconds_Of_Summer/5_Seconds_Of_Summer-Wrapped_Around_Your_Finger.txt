<song artist="5_Seconds_Of_Summer" title="Wrapped_Around_Your_Finger">
Throwing rocks at your window at midnight
You met me in your backyard that night
In the moonlight you looked just like an angel in disguise
My whole life seemed like a postcard
You were mine for a night
I was out of my mind
You were mine for a night
I don't know how to say goodbye
Making all our plans in the Santa Cruz sand that night
Thought I had you in the palm of my hand that night
Screaming at the top of my lungs til my chest felt tight
I told myself that I'm never gonna be alright
You had me wrapped around your ﬁnger
I'm wrapped around your ﬁnger
I'm wrapped around your ﬁnger
I'm wrapped around your ﬁnger
I'm wrapped around your ﬁnger
I'm wrapped around your ﬁnger
I'm wrapped around your ﬁnger
I'm wrapped around your ﬁnger
Throwing rocks at your window at midnight
You met me in your backyard that night
You were mine for a night
I was out of my mind
You were mine for a night
I don't know how to say goodbye
Making all our plans in the Santa Cruz sand that night
Thought I had you in the palm of my hand that night
Screaming at the top of my lungs til my chest felt tight
I told myself that I'm never gonna be alright
You had me wrapped around your ﬁnger
I'm wrapped around your ﬁnger
I'm wrapped around your ﬁnger
I'm wrapped around your ﬁnger
I'm wrapped around your ﬁnger
I'm wrapped around your ﬁnger
I'm wrapped around your ﬁnger
I'm wrapped around your ﬁnger
Wrapped around your ﬁnger
Wrapped around your ﬁnger
