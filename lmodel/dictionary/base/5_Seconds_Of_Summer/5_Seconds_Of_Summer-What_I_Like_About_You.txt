<song artist="5_Seconds_Of_Summer" title="What_I_Like_About_You">
Hey! Hey!
That's what I like about you
You hold me tight
Tell me I'm the only one
Wanna come over tonight?
Yeah
Keep on whispering in my ear
Tell me all the things that I wanna hear
'Cause it's true, that's what I like about you
What I like about you
You really know how to dance
When you go up, down, jump around
Think about true romance, yeah
Keep on whispering in my ear
Tell me all the things that I wanna hear
'Cause it's true, that's what I like about you
That's what I like about you
(What I like about you)
That's what I like about you
(What I like about you)
That's what I like about you
(What I like about you)
That's what I like about you
Hey!
What I like about you
You keep me warm at night
Never wanna let you go
Know you make me feel alright
Keep on whispering in my ear
Tell me all the things that I wanna hear
'Cause it's true, that's what I like about you
That's what I like about you
(What I like about you)
That's what I like about you
(What I like about you)
That's what I like about you
(What I like about you)
That's what I like about you, you
That's what I like about you
