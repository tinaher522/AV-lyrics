<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="I_Was_A_Lover,_A_Leader_Of_Men">
Ah, ah, ah, ah ..
I was a lover, a leader of men
All of the women I knew were my friends
I was so happy, my feet on the ground 
I didn't know I was on the way down 
'cause you don't feel the same 
It's only a game, it's only a game , it's only a game 
Ah, ah, ah, ah ..
I had a billion or two in the bank 
I gave to charity, ain't got no thanks
You gave me all that a woman could give 
Less you're affection, I don't want to live 
'cause you don't feel the same 
It's only a game, it's only a game, it's only a game 
'cause you don't feel the same
I was a lover, a leader of men 
All of the women I knew were my friends
I was so happy, my feet on the ground 
I didn't know, I was on the way down 
'cause you don't feel the same
It's only a game, it's only a game, it's only a game 
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah...
