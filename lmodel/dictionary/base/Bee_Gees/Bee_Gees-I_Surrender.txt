<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="I_Surrender">
From the highest tower, I will call you home
It's the same old story, love will find it's own
You come to me, conspiracy of the night
The heart that you want just happens to be mine
Thieves in the dark, you ought to be locked in chains
But you wind up on my side, and what will be will be
That you wear a disguise, the epitome of deceit
The face of a friend invisible on the street
If you're battling to be mine, I'm victorious in defeat
And I surrender, I surrender
Anybody want me, anyone know my name
Do it in a lifetime, you be dust and the soul survives
Evens up the score
From the highest tower, I will call you home
It's the same old story, love will find it's own
And I surrender, take me for all time
Love that lasts forever, I surrender
We are elite, prisoners of the night
We fight to the finish and savour the delights
It's your body that got me beat, at I'm crumbling at your feet
I surrender, I surrender
I will walk through fire, keep you safe and sound
In the final hour, turn my life around
And I surrender, take me for all time
This is my life story, I've been lost and found
In the final hour, turn my life around
And I surrender. take me for all time
Love as warm as wine, and I surrender
Take me for all time, love that lasts forever
