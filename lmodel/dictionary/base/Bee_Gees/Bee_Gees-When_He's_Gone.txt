<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="When_He's_Gone">
Stormy nights, I've been waiting
Satisfy you, oh yeah
But his love is just a game
And he's sellng you the same old lies
And I'm hangin' on the wire
And no closer to the fire
And you don't hear me when I cry
You may need someone to lean upon
When he's gone, when he's gone
And what is left is a love so strong
When he's gone, when he's gone
You wouldn't believe to what extent
My mind is going to
You wouldn't deny me in your dreams
You couldn't belong to someone else
If you could see me now
And I'd be the only one
When he's gone
My understanding that you remember
For whom the bell tolls, oh yeah
I swear to you I pray
That you feel the battle rage
For the saving of my soul
And it's a struggle to survive
You know it's keepin' us alive
And baby I don't wanna die
I will be someone you lean upon
When he's gone, when he's gone
And what is left is a love so strong
When he's gone, when he's gone
You wouldn't believe to what extent
My mind is going to
You wouldn't deny me in your dreams
You couldn't belong to someone else
If you could see me now
And I'd be the only one
When he's gone
I will be someone you lean upon
When he's gone, when he's gone
And what is left is a love so strong
When he's gone, when he's gone
I will be someone you lean upon
When he's gone, when he's gone
Don't tell me it's too late
And your love don't make me wait
I can see the end of time
With a love that makes you mine
And tonight I let you know
There's a love that won't let go
