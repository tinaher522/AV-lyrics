<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="Sun_In_My_Morning">
When all my troubles just surround me
And all my problems seem to ground me
There is a thing I'm thinkin' of
Sun in my morning and my sky above
Sun in my morning and my sky above
I'm not like you , I'm not a rich man
I work and do the best that I can
There is a place I'm thinkin' of
Sun in my morning and my sky above
Sun in my morning and my sky above
I've got my women there to guide me
In all my darkness , she will guide me
She is the think I'm talkin' of
She's my sun in the morning and my sky above
Sun in my morning and my sky above
