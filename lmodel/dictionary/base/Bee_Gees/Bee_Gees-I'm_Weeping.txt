<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="I'm_Weeping">
When I was 10 years old, my parents were poor 
Our house was so cold
And I was still in school and learning
And then I never really got too far
And ev'ryone we knew had money
And driving a car, and driving a car
Now I'm twenty-one 
The street where I lived is blown up and gone
And I've had a good day crying
And the world around has changed alot
I never really gave much more
Much more then I got, much more then I got
