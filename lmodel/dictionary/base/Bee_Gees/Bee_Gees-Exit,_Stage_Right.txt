<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="Exit,_Stage_Right">
Baby, I've got a one-way ticket to nowhere. 
Ain't got hundreds, so I count money in this chair. 
Exit, stage right. Baby, I get stage fright, 
And my baby runs this show and she's got a big share. 
Sold my car and I got no transport in this town. 
One night, baby, you'll look for me. I won't be around. 
Exit, stage right. Baby, I get stage fright, 
And my baby runs this show and she's got a big share.
