<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="Ellan_Vannin">
When the summer day is over
It's busy cares have flown
I will sit beneath the starlight
With a weary heart alone
Then it rises like a vision
Sparkling bright it shines for me
My own dear Ellan Vannin
With it's green hills by the sea
Let me hear the ocean murmur
Let me watch your stormy sky
Then above the emerald waters
Sings the seagull as she flies
Then it rises like a vision
Sparkling bright it shines for me
My own dear Ellan Vannin
With it's green hills by the sea
And in all my times of sorrow
And on some lonely shore
I'll go back to Ellan Vannin
To my childhood days once more
