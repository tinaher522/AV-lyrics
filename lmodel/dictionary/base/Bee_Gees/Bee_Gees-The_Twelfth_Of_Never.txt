<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="The_Twelfth_Of_Never">
You ask how much I need you
Must I explain
I need you oh my darling
Like roses need rain
You ask how long I'll love you
I'll tell you true
Until the twelfth of never I'll still be loving you
Hold me close
Never let me go
Hold me close
Melt my heart like April snow
I'll love you 'till the blue bells forget to bloom
I'll love you 'till the clover has lost its perfume
I'll love you 'till the poets run out of rhyme
Oh, until the twelfth of never
And that's a long long time
Until the twelfth of never
And that's a long long time
