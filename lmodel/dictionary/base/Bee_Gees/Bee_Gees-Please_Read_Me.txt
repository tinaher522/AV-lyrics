<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="Please_Read_Me">
Many years ago I was a simple man 
A simple man, no worries me; 
I never lied 
Please read me. 
Not much conversation ever came from me, 
I never saw reality; 
I never tried. 
Please read me. 
Ah...
Maybe I've been lying on your couch too long 
I'll stay if you can see me through
Explain why 
Please read me. Please read me. Please read me.
