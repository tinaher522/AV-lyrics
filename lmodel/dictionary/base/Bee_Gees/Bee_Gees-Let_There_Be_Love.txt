<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="Let_There_Be_Love">
Let there be love, so I can be loved by you
In Paradise Avenue
Let there be life, so everyone lives to love
Let it happen to me and you
I am a man, so take me for what I am
I'll never have everything, but let there be love
Let there be love, let there be love
I can be nothing, or I can be something
I've got to give you my life
I'm tired of living without your giving
I've got to get you for my wife
Can't hold on much longer
The feeling's getting stronger
I never begged, but I'm begging now
Let there be love, so I can be loved by you
On Paradise Avenue, oh yo
Let there be life, so we can all live to love
And let it be both of us
I am a man, so take me for what I am
I'll never have everything, but let there be love
Let there be love, let there be love
