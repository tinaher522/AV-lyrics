<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="We're_The_Bunburys">
We're the Bunburys, you're a Bunbury too
When you're living in a world of Bunburys
Tears don't fall and dreams come true
When you're a Bunbury, fly the Bunbury way
Everybody want to be a Bunbury
Don't delay, don't delay the test of your life
Fly away, fly, fly away, everybody wants to be a Bunbury
Don't delay, don't delay
You can dream, you can dream about your island paradise
There have been so many dreams for you
Ain't that nice but you can't go
You can send your mother to say hello
To the blue sky and the blue sea
To see those palm trees swaying
All those starry nights, all those sunny days
And you can hear them singing
Their voices ringing across the bay
We're the Bunburys, you're a Bunbury too
Everybody wants to be a Bunbury
To make all your dreams come true for the rest of your life
Fly away, fly, fly away, everybody wants to be a Bunbury
Don't delay, don't delay
We are one, we complete our mission well
We've gotta be a team on a life crusade
'Cause you never can tell when somebody needs your help
What a place of wonder that the world can be
For the young girls and the young boys
I still can hear those palm trees swaying
All those starry nights, all those sunny days
And you can hear them singing their voices ringing across the bay
Join us, rest of your life, everybody
Join us, everybody, everybody
Join us, rest of your life, everybody
Join us, everybody, everybody
Everybody want to be a Bunbury
To make all your dreams come true
You're a Bunbury, I'm a Bunbury too
Everybody wants to be a Bunbury
To make all your dreams come true
For the rest of your life, fly away
(We're the Bunburys)
Fly, fly away
(You're a Bunbury too)
Fly away
