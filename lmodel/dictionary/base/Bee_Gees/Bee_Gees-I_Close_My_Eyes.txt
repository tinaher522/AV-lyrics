<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="I_Close_My_Eyes">
Look at me I'm riding high 
Don't know what's wrong with me. 
Can't you see I'm not the guy 
that I pretend to be. 
Though I know I will be lonely 
But our love will never die 
I close my eyes, everyday, I close my eyes. 
Ah...
The more I try the more I fail, 
I'd like to run away. 
But if I try you pass me by, 
I know that I can't stay. 
Though I know I will be lonely 
But our love will never die 
I close my eyes, everyday, I close my eyes. 
Ah... 
Ah...
Though I know I will be lonely 
But our love will never die 
I close my eyes, everyday, I close my eyes 
I close my eyes. I close my eyes. I close my eyes
