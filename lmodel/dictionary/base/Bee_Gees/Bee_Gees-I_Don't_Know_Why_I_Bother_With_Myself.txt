<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="I_Don't_Know_Why_I_Bother_With_Myself">
I'm a fool, I've taken no advice 
And I'm so cruel, I'm talkin' to you nice 
But then again you may not take me back 
Oh just to put my hat back on your rack 
Guess I don't know why I bother with myself 
You will find a part of me in someone else 
I never argued with the fact that she is mine 
I only hurt her and kissed her three times out of nine 
You have the edge to talk to men and make them feel at home 
You spent that every lasting cent on someone that's not your own 
Bear with me there's bound to be a chance 
To heal the wound and start back our romance 
I gained a heart and part of it is yours 
Oh just to see my love walk through these doors 
Oh and my life's bound out ahead, I can not look 
And if you read me, then I am just a book 
You don't care if rain falls in my room 
You won't be there if trouble fills my spoon 
I'm just a clown that plays around with misery in my way 
Forgetting all the rules of love ...
