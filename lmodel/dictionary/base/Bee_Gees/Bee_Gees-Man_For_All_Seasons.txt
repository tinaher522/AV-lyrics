<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="Man_For_All_Seasons">
Everybody wants to leave
Just like you and I
I have all year to smile
A tear for every eye
Life closed its eyes, broke my world, now I cry
Ive got to tell you, Ive got the reasons
cause Im a man, a man for all seasons, alive
And would I pray
What makes the world go round
I havent got today
My mind is lost and found
Life closed its eyes and said goodbye, now I cry
But Ive got to tell you, Ive got my reasons
cause Im a man, a man for all seasons, alive
And would I pray what makes the world go round
I havent got today, my mind is lost and found
Du du du du du du du
Im a man for all seasons
Im a man for all seasons
Im a man for all seasons
Im a man for all seasons
