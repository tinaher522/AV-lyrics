<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="Marley_Purt_Drive">
Sunday morning, woke up yawning; filled the pool for a swim. 
Pulled down the head and looked in the glass just to see if I was in. 
Went up the stairs and kissed my women to make her come alive. 
'Cause with fifteen kids and a fam'ly on the skids, 
I got to go for a Sunday drive. 
Fifteen kids and a fam'ly on the skids, 
I got to go for a Sunday drive. 
That's how they are, so I grabbed out the car;convertible fifty-nine. 
Headed for the freeway; tried to find the Pasadena sign. 
Ten miles and three quarters more I wasn't feeling any more alive. 
'Cause with fifteen kids and a fam'ly on the skids, 
I got to go for a Sunday drive. 
Fifteen kids and a fam'ly on the skids, 
I got to go for a Sunday drive. 
I used to be a minstrel free with a whole lot of bread in my bag. 
I used to feel that my life was real, but the good Lord threw me a snag. 
Now I'm gonna be the same as me, no matter how I try. 
'Cause with fifteen kids and a fam'ly on the skids, 
I got to go for a Sunday drive. 
Fifteen kids and a fam'ly on the skids, 
I got to go for a Sunday drive. 
Turned 'round the car and headed for home; I guess I realized my fate. 
Ten miles and three quarters more I pulled up outside the gate. 
Twenty more kids were stood inside and that made thirty-five. 
'Cause with an orphanage full of thirty-five kids, 
I got to go for a Sunday drive. 
An orphanage full of thirty-five kids, 
I got to go for a Sunday drive. 
Sunday morning woke up yawning; filled the pool for a swim. 
Pulled down the glass and looked in the mirror just to see if I was in . 
Went up the stairs and kissed my women to make her come alive. 
'Cause with an orphanage full of thirty-five kids, 
I got to go for a Sunday drive. 
And orphanage full of thirty-five kids, 
I got to go for a Sunday drive.
