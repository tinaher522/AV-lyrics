<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="Lonely_Winter">
Now the summer's gone,
And the winter's coming on,
And I wait for you,
But I know that you have gone away from me,
And I know, yes I know
It's gonna be a lonely winter.
Just to walk alone, 
And leave all the love we've known.
Autumn leaves will fall.
Wish winter would only call you back to me.
And I know, yes I know
It's gonna be a lonely winter.
It, I know, could be a very long time.
I can't make your love mine,
Mine and mine alone.
But I know that I can't make you love me,
I can't make you want me,
Till the winter's gone.
Leaves begin to fall,
And the trees begin to bare.
Then I wait for you, 
But I know that you're not here.
You've gone away.
And I know, yes I know
It's gonna be a lonely winter.
