<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="Live_Or_Die_(Hold_Me_Like_A_Child)">
Take one breath
One fundamental sign of life
Don't look back, don't analyze
The tears that you cry
Only the strong survive
The silent sacrifice
And I, I will be your heart of steel
But power has a price
Ain't it time that you believe in someone
Ain't it wrong to let the years go by
Standing face to face forever
Live or die
Hold me like a child
I'm not alive until you do
What you hold in your hand is a miracle
And it's dead if I don't have you
Hold me like a child
Swear you never let go
You're the eye of the storm
The reason I laugh or cry
Live or die
I will stay with you
Take one breath
One fundamental sign of life
No bad blood
No pain can make you draw the knife
We got a world of trouble
But I will never change
And even if we fall tomorrow
We will rise again
Now is the time we show each other
These are the words I kept inside
Standing face to face forever
Live of die
Hold me like a child
I'm not alive until you do
What you hold in your hand is a miracle
And it's dead if I don't have you
Hold me like a child
Swear you never let go
You're the eye of the storm
The reason I laugh or cry
Live or die
I will stay with you
Live or die
I will stay, with you
Take one breath
One fundamental sign of life
Don't look back
We love each other live or die
Hold me like a child
I'm not alive until you do
Live or die
I will stay with you
Take one breath
One fundamental sign of life
Don't look back
We love each other live or die
Hold me like a child
