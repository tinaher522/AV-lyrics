<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="Technicolor_Dreams">
Now, I've been accused of going Hollywood
Chasing some cinematic schemes
But I'll give you Panavision pictures
'Cos you give me Technicolor dreams
Up there, walking on air
I'd like to show you how
I loved you way back then
As much as I need you now
Some people like to send the world away
Some sunlight on some silver beams
And I'll give you Panavision pictures
'Cos you give me Technicolor dreams
Oh wow, look at us now
All of our dreams fulfill
I would implore you still
From under your windowsill
Sometimes, I'd like to send the world away
Some sunlight on some silver beams
So I'll give you Panavision pictures
'Cos you give me Technicolor dreams
Technicolor dreams
I'll give you Panavision pictures
'Cause you give me Technicolor dreams
Go far, follow your star
I'll help you climb that hill
I would adore you still
From under your windowstill
Sometimes I'd like to send the world away
Some sunlight under some silver beams
So I'll give you Panavision pictures
'Cause you give me Technicolor dreams
Technicolor dreams
