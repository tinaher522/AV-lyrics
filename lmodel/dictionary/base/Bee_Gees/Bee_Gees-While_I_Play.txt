<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="While_I_Play">
I cry tears of emotion to spread across the USA
Ain't no sunshine cowboy in your pockets 
I'll make my own way , while I play
Baby you forgot your living
Someone covered up your eyes
In my way at least I'm giving what I love
Am I wise
There's gonna be some confusion 
And there's gonna be a day
You'll raise your eyes and you'll look to the skies
And you'll pray , while I play  
I am my father's son or that is what I heard
Maybe I got it wrong
I didn't mean a word
You got my face and I'll play your ace
Pretend I haven't heard
There's gonna be some confusion
And there's gonna be a day
You'll raise your eyes and you'll look to the skies
And you'll pray , while I play
I am a minstreal , that is all I want to be
I'll play inside your soul
I'll show you to yourself
Fill your head with wild emotions
A symphony in wealth
There's gonna be some confusion
And there's gonna be a day
You'll raise your eyes and you'll look to the skies
And you'll pray , while I play
I will take my leave , I gotta move ontime
I played inside your soul , made you sing along
I will return to find out if the melody was wrong 
There's gonna be some confusion 
And there's gonna be a day
You'll raise your eyes and you'll look to the skies
And you'll pray , while I play
