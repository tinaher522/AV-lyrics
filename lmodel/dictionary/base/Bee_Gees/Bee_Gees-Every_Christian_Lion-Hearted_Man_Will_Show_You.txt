Oh solo Dominique 
Oh solo Dominique 
Oh solo Dominique 
Oh solo Dominique 
Take this in hand 
Said he who stands 
Behind the chair 
A broken table there 
Every Christian lion-hearted man will show you 
Every Christian lion-hearted man will show you 
Oh solo Dominique 
Oh solo Dominique 
Oh solo Dominique 
Oh solo Dominique 
Don't walk so tall 
Before you crawl 
For every child 
Is thinking of something wild 
Every Christian lion-hearted man will show you 
Every Christian lion-hearted man will show you 
Oh solo Dominique 
Oh solo Dominique 
Oh solo Dominique 
Every Christian lion-hearted man will show you 
Every Christian lion-hearted man will show you (will show you) 
Oh solo Dominique 
Oh solo Dominique 
Oh solo Dominique
