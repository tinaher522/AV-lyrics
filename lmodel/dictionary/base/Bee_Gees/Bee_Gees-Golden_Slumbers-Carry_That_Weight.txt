<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="Golden_Slumbers-Carry_That_Weight">
Once there was a way to get back homeward
Once there was a way to get back home
Sleep pretty darling, do not cry, and I will sing a lullaby
Golden Slumbers fill your eyes
Smiles await you when you rise
Sleep pretty darling, do not cry, and I will sing a lullaby
Once there was a way to get back homeward
Once there was a way, to get back home
Sleep pretty darling, do not cry, and I will sing a lullaby
Boy, you're gonna carry that weight
Carry that weight a long time
Boy, you're gonna carry that weight
Carry that weight a long time
(Repeat)
