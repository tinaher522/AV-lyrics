<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="In_The_Summer_Of_His_Years">
In the summer of his years he would always smile;
He would laugh ev'ry day if he was here to stay.
For the summer of his years.
In the daylight of his dreams he would save his tears;
He would always hear when there was no one near
For the Summer of his years.
Ah,ah,  ah, ah , ah,
Ah,ah,ah,  ah, ah,
Ah,ah,ah,  ah, ah,
Ah,ah,ah,ah,  ah, ah,
For the Summer of his years,
For the Summer of his years,
Ah,ah.
