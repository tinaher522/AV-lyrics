<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="Somebody_Stop_The_Music">
I arise, try to see my face through my disguise.
And on the balcony I knew inside of me it will be done.
Somebody stop the music. Somebody stop the tune.
Somebody crown the clown with the red balloon.
Somebody stop the music. Somebody stop the tune.
Somebody crown the clown with the red balloon.
I arose, the truth will out the more it grows.
It's not a mystery, no one was hiding it from me.
Somebody stop the music. Somebody stop the tune.
Somebody crown the clown with the red balloon.
Somebody stop the music. Somebody stop the tune.
Somebody crown the clown with the red balloon.
Don't love ya, baby don't love ya 
Don't love ya, baby don't love ya
Don't love ya, baby don't love ya
Don't love ya, baby don't love ya
Don't love ya, baby don't love ya
Yeah, today I saw the sun, the sun
