<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="Walking_On_Air">
I've been around the world
You'll never know just how long I've been praying
To get you into my life
It won't be long before you understand
Even our love becomes a master plan, and so I
I think I'm walking on air
So much in love I can't tell what I'm saying
There'll be no running away
You and I won't be apart again
I know in my heart that we can start again
Wait for the summer
When love's in the air
You won't be sorry
You answered my prayer
I see the games that you play
And I don't care what the people are saying
No other love can compare
Just to hold you in my arms again
I feel like walking on air
And just to dream you'll be there keeps me going
And all those days go by
We will never be apart again
Knowing our love will never die
Wait for the summer
When love's in the air
We'll be together this time of the year
We will never be apart again
Knowing our love will never die
Here comes the summer
With love in the air
You won't be sorry
You answered my prayer
Here comes the summer
And everyone's here
We will be sailin'
Through year after year
You know I'm walking on air
I know I'm walking on air
You know I'm walking on air
