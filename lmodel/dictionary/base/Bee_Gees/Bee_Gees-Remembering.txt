<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="Remembering">
I never really want to be alone.
I had a woman once in my life and but now she's flown.
Ev'ry night I keep seeing her face.
I never really broke her heart. She was a part of me.
But that's the way it was now we live sep'ratly.
When will you walk through this door babe?
When you left I fell to pieces.
But now I feel as good as if I were dead.
I'll keep remembering all my life.
Remembering when you were my wife.
Remembering all my life.
And I'm facing a life that I must go through remembering.
I first set my eyes on you one cold February.
You made me go out of my way to make me feel fine.
Oh but when will you walk through this door babe?
When you left I fell to pieces.
Now I feel as good as good as if I were dead.
I'll keep remembering all my life.
Remembering when you were my wife.
Remembering all my life.
And I'm facing a life that I must go through remembering.
