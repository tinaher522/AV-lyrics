<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="Then_You_Left_Me">
I never ask for any time from you baby.
I never ask for any lies.
You only hurt the one you love the most baby.
You only had to make me cry.
'Cause you left me (you left me) all alone (you left me)
You left me (you left me) to stand alone.
And ev'ry night I sit beside my bed baby.
And I keep thinking of your love.
The things we dreamed about.
How much I love you baby.
We had the world and the stars above.
But then you left me (you left me) all alone. (you left me)
You left me. You left me (you left me) to stand alone.
You left me to stand alone.
You left me to stand alone.
You left me. You left me. You left me. You left me.
