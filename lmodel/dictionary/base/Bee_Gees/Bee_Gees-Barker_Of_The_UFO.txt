<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="Barker_Of_The_UFO">
Barker sing me a song 
Instead of counting trees,
Collecting aeroplane numbers now, Mr Barker
Clitheroe shine my shoes 
Fly me to the moon,
Never before have I seen the like, Mr Barker 
Then the moment of depression fell around, Mr Barker
And the changes of expression to a frown, My friend Barker
There must be something there
Shadow of a light, meaning men we are here, Mr Barker
Then the moment of depression fell around, Mr Barker
And the changes of expression to a frown, my friend Barker
There must be something there
Shadow of a light, meaning men we are here, Mr Barker
Barker sing me a song 
Instead of counting trees,
Collecting aeroplane numbers now, Mr Barker
Clitheroe shine my shoes
Fly me to the moon,
Never before have I seen the like
 
Barker sing me a song 
Instead of counting trees,
collecting aeroplane numbers now, Mr Barker
Clitheroe shine my shoes 
Fly me to the moon, 
Never before have I seen the like
