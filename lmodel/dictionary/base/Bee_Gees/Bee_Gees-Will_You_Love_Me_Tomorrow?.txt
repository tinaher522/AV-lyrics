<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="Will_You_Love_Me_Tomorrow?">
Tonight with words unspoken
You say that I'm the only one
Ah, tomorrow
Tonight you're mine completely
You give your love so sweetly
Tonight the light of love is in your eyes
But will you love me tomorrow?
Is this a lasting treasure
Or just a moment of pleasure?
Can I believe the magic of your sighs?
Oh, will you still love me tomorrow?
Oh
Tonight with words unspoken
You say that I am the only one
But will my heart be broken
When the night (when the night)
Meets the (meets the) morning sun?
I'd like to know that your love, oh baby
Is love I can be sure of
So tell me now, and I won't ask again, oh baby
Will you still love me tomorrow?
Will you still love me tomorrow?
Will you still love me tomorrow?
Oh, love me tomorrow
Oh baby, will you still love me
Will you still need me
Love me Tomorrow, oh
