<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="The_Extra_Mile">
I want to go where no one's gone before
And my faith will find the way
And I'm not afraid
Now I am here with all that is true
So many times
You lived with my strength and my pain
You are my friend
I'm ready to walk that line
Ready to fight, for
I'm not alone in the night
You're always in sight and it's so right
For once in your life, let your soul shine through
And know I will go
That extra mile for you
In all the years, you suffer for your love
And my tears will fade away
Heaven above
Now I can steer my ship to the shore
Borne on the wind
All's fair in love and in war
Steady and sure
I'm ready to walk that line
Ready to fight, I'll
Weather the storm in the night, you're always around and it's so right
For once in your life let your soul shine through
And know I will go
That extra mile for you
Ready to walk that line
Ready to fight, I'll
Weather the storm in the night
You're always in sight and it's so right
For once in your life let your soul shine through
And know I will go
That extra mile for you
