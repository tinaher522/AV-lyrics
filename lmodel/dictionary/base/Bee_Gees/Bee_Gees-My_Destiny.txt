<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="My_Destiny">
It's a circle
I believe in change for the better girl
Those ebony eyes
Does love only seem to be satisfied
And in a world that lives without it
It makes the safest medicine
And all the summer nights
And you know that I know
I dream about you and I won't let go
And it's been so long
And I can't go on
It's my destiny
And I must be strong
You know it's all right
And it may be wrong
My destiny
And I must go on
Ooh , hold you 'til the sun comes out
Ooh , smother me
I must be insane in love
To let you treat me like a fool
Kinder to be cruel of you gotta lie
By your side
That's the place to be seen
'til the day I die
Ooh , I did nothin' to start it
I'm just an aimless passenger
And all the summer nights
I've been lost to the storm
I dream about you
And it keeps me warm
And it's been so long
And I can't go on
It's my destiny
And I must be strong
You know it's all right
And it may be wrong
My destiny
And I must go on
Make me tremble when I'm seeing you
I'm born to live through the pain again
I'm moving high and low
I'm gonna get you but I don't know when
