<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="Jive_Talkin'">
It's just your jive talkin'
You're telling me lies, yeah
Jive talkin'
You wear a disguise
Jive talkin'
So misunderstood, yeah
Jive talkin'
You're really no good
Oh, my child, you'll never know
Just what you mean to me
Oh, my child, you got so much
You're gonna take away my energy
With all of your jive talkin'
You're telling me lies, yeah
Good lovin'
Still gets in my eyes
Nobody believe what you say, yeah
It's just your jive talkin'
That gets in the way
Oh, my
Ba be ba be la, ba be ba be la
Ba be ba be la, ba be ba be la
Oh, my love, you're so good
Treating me so cruel
There you go with your fancy lies
Leavin' me lookin' like a dumbstruck fool
With all your jive talkin'
You're telling me lies, yeah
Jive talkin'
You wear a disguise
Jive talkin'
So misunderstood, yeah
Jive talkin'
You just ain't no good
L-l-love, love talkin'
Is all very fine, yeah
And jive talkin'
Just isn't a crime
And if there's somebody
You'll love 'til you die
Then all that jive talkin'
Just gets in your eye, after, ah
Ba be ba be la, ba be ba be la
La, la, la, la, la, la
Ba be ba be la, ba be ba be la
La, la, la, la, la, la
Ba be ba be la, ba be ba be la
Jive talkin'
You telling me lies, yeah
Good lovin'
Still gets in my eyes
Nobody believe what you say
It's just your jive talkin'
That gets in the way
L-l-l-love, love talkin'
Is all very fine, yeah
Jive talkin'
Just isn't a crime
And if there's somebody
You'll love 'til you die
Then all that jive talkin'
Just gets in your eye, yeah, yeah
Oh, jive talkin'
Jive talkin', yeah, yeah, oh
Jive talkin', ha, woo
