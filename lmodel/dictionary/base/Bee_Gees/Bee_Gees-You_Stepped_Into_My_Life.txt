<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="You_Stepped_Into_My_Life">
You stepped into my life
And I'm oh, so happy.
You stepped into my life
And I'm oh, so happy.
You stepped into my life,
Stepped into my life
Stepped into my life
And I'm oh, so happy.
You stepped into my life
And I'm oh, so.
Before you came my way
I always checked this out;
So much pain in love
And so alone inside.
I never thought
That I'd believe in love so much.
But darling when you came close to me,
Suddenly, suddenly
You stepped into my life
And I'm oh, so happy.
You stepped into my life
And I'm oh, so happy.
You stepped into my life,
Stepped into my life
Stepped into my life
And I'm oh, so happy.
You stepped into my life
And I'm oh, so.
You will never know 
What you have done, my love.
You gave me so much more
My love is worthy of.
Beneath my very soul
I kneel before your touch.
Your touch is ecstasy,
Close to me.
Suddenly, suddenly
You stepped into my life,
Stepped into my life
Stepped into my life
And I'm oh, so happy.
You stepped into my life...
