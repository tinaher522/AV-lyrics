<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="How_To_Fall_In_Love_(Part_1)">
I got a bad sensation
The enemy is all around
The traces of my naked heart
Are laid upon the ground
I suffered side effects
That might have been forever
Even in my dreams
And I was left alone to pray
When there was no one in the way
And nothin' what it seemed
And from a hard time, play time
Took a trip around the world
Made myself invisible
The taste was in the wine
And just when the thought of someone
Needing me forever
I don't believe the words are true
That only she could be my savior
Experience is not enough
I'll show you how to fall in love
She said experience is not enough
I'll show you how to fall in love
And she's all alone with me
Every night
And lighting all my days of sorrow
On my own
If there was any more to give
You know I'd sacrifice it for her
And in the prime of my life
I was blessed and I was sent
Someone sweet and innocent
And nervous when she kissed
And in the face of my
Forbidden fruit forever
Miracles are mine
And knowing I'm the first
In her secret universe
There's no sense of space and time
You take a small town, young girl
Someone warm and wonderful
That any man would understand
That love is like the wind
Something deep inside to give you
And when the words get in the way
The only thing you need is silence
Experience is not enough
I'll show you how to fall in love
She said experience is not enough
I'll show you how to fall in love
