<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="Decadance">
What're you doing on your back? 
What're you doing on your back? 
You should be dancing, yeah, 
dancing, yeah. 
My baby moves at midnight, 
goes right on till the dawn. 
My woman takes me higher, 
my woman keeps me warm. 
What're you doing on your back? 
What're you doing on your back? 
You should be dancing, yeah, 
dancing, yeah. 
She's juicy and she's trouble. 
She gets it to me good. 
My woman gives me power, 
goes right down to my blood. 
What you doing on your back? 
What you doing on your back? 
You should be dancing, yeah, 
dancing, yeah. 
What you doing on your back, aah? 
What you doing on your back, aah? 
You should be dancing, yeah, 
dancing, yeah. 
My baby moves at midnight, 
goes right on till the dawn. 
My woman takes me higher, 
my woman keeps me warm. 
What you doing on your back, aah? 
What you doing on your back, aah? 
You should be dancing, yeah, 
dancing, yeah. 
What you doing on your back, aah? 
What you doing on your back, aah? 
You should be dancing, yeah, 
dancing, yeah. 
You should be dancing, yeah 
You should be dancing, yeah 
You should be dancing, yeah 
You should be dancing, yeah 
You should be dancing, yeah...
