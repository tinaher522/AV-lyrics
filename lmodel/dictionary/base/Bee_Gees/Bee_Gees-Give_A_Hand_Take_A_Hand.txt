<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="Give_A_Hand_Take_A_Hand">
I wish the world was run by all the little children
We could be happy once again
We won't hurt when we're like little children
And we won't ever feel the pain
Now when my fight for life on earth is over
And I leave 'cause I can't stay
All my love belongs to you hereafter
And we'll all join hands another day
Everybody's got to give a hand
Everybody's got to take a hand
Everybody's got to fall in love, yeah
To make everybody understand
Everybody's got to give, take a hand
I love you, yes, I do, I told you a million times now
Now, do you believe the words I say?
All my life belongs to you hereafter
And we'll all join hands another day
Everybody's got to give a hand
Everybody's got to take a hand
Everybody's got to fall in love, yeah
To make everybody understand
Everybody's got to give, take a hand
Everybody's got to give a hand
Everybody's got to take a hand
Everybody's got to fall in love, yeah
To make everybody understand
Everybody's got to give, take a hand
