<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="If_I_Can't_Have_You">
Don't know why 
I'm surviving every lonely day
When there's got to be no chance for me
My life would end 
And it just don't matter how I cry
My tears of love are a waste of time 
If I turn away
Am I strong enough to see it through
Go crazy is what I will do
If I can't have you, I don't want nobody, baby
If I can't have you, ah hah hah, ah
If I can't have you, I don't want nobody, baby
If I can't have you, ah hah hah, ah
Can't let go 
And it doesn't matter how I try
I gave it all so easily 
To you my love
To dreams that never will come true
Am I strong enough to see it through
Go crazy is what I will do
If I can't have you, I don't want nobody, baby
If I can't have you, ah hah hah, ah
If I can't have you, I don't want nobody, baby
If I can't have you, ah hah hah, ah
If I can't have you, I don't want nobody, baby
If I can't have you, ah hah hah, ah
If I can't have you, I don't want nobody, baby
If I can't have you, ah hah hah, ah
