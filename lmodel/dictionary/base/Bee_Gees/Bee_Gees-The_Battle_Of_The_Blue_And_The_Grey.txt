<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="The_Battle_Of_The_Blue_And_The_Grey">
Now it's gone, gone, gone, those years have passed away.
It's gone, gone, gone, there's truth in what I say.
It's gone, gone, gone, there's nothing more to say
But I'd do anything if I could do it all again.
Well, I'm an old man now and I'm born to win the race.
People won't believe me but there's truth in what I say.
Many hearts were broken and a lot of tears were shed.
The sky was black and the battlefield was red.
Now it's gone, gone, gone, those years have passed away.
It's gone, gone, gone, there's truth in what I say.
It's gone, gone, gone, there's nothing more to say
But I'd do anything if I could do it all again .
Now, Stonewall Jackson stepped right up and then he said to me
He said: The battle is getting rough, son, guess we better flee.
There's grapeshot all around us and the field is black with lead.
You better start running boy before you lose your head.
Now it's gone, gone, gone, those years have passed away.
It's gone, gone, gone, there's truth in what I say.
It's gone, gone, gone, there's nothing more to say
But I'd do anything if I could do it all again.
Well, the cannons roared around us and the field was black with lead,
I picked a soldier dressed in blue and filled him full of lead,
I picked out six more soldiers there sitting on a mound,
I fixed my bayonet to my gun and really mowed them down.
Now, it's gone, gone, gone, those years have passed away.
It's gone, gone, gone, there's truth in what I say.
It's gone, gone, gone, there's nothing more to say
But I'd do anything if I could do it all again,
But I'd do anything if I could do it all again.
