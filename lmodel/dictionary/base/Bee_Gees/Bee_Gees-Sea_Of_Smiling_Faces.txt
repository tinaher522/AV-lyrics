<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="Sea_Of_Smiling_Faces">
Yesterday was history who knows what there is gonna be when we meet again
Will you smile and tell the world about me  
Can there be no doubt about me I was your friend
As I gaze upon a sea of smiling faces
Walk amongst the glow of moonlit places
The look in your eyes, to see your smile
Won't bring you back to me
I remember things we planned 
The world would never understand but we found a way
And the world of love you gave to me 
Each moment is a memory, whatever they say
As I gaze upon a sea of smiling faces
Walk amongst the glow of moonlit places
The look in your eye, to see you smile
Won't bring you back to me
For the look in your eye, to see your smile
Won't bring you back to me
Yesterday was history who knows what there is gonna be when me meet again
Will you smile and tell the world about me
Can there be no doubt about me I was your friend
As I gaze upon a sea of smiling faces 
Walk amongst the glow of moonlit places
The look in your eye, to see your smile
Won't bring you back to me
For the look in your eye, to see your smile
Won't bring you back to me
For the look ...
