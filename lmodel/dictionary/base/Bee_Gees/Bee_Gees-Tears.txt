<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="Tears">
I started out to be, a man behind the scenes,
Knowing I was in above my head.
The role that I could see, I never saw the truth now I'm alone,
Heaven only know hows much I'm missing you,
Knowing I had heaven in my hands,
Then there will be tears, tears are mixed with rain,
Keeper of my fate,
Time and tide is on my side,
Stands forever,
There'll be nights of love and yes,
There will be tears,
I will not sleep tonight,
There will be tears tonight,
I will not sleep tonight,
There will be tears.
The silent telephone, the turning of the key,
Are still inside of me, I'm not ashamed,
But all that I can do, I can't foget your face,
I call your name,
Heaven only knows what I've been cryin for,
All I've done to keep this love alive,
Even threw my tears, tears are mixed with rain,
Keeper of my fate, time will bring her on my side,
Stands forever,
There'll be nights of love and yes there will be tears.
I will not sleep tonight,
There will be tears tonight,
I will not sleep tonight,
There will be..
Soon there will be tears, rollin down my brow,
Keeper of my fate,
Time and tide is on my side,
Stands forever,
There will be nights of love and yes there will be tears,
I will not sleep tonight,
I will not sleep tonight,
I will not sleep tonight...
