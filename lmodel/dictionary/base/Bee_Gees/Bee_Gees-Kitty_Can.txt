<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="Kitty_Can">
Eve never pleases me and Kitty can 
Eve never pleases me and Kitty can 
When Kitty smiles, the world stands still 
I see a thousand golden daffodils 
But when she cries, the world just dies 
I see a million tears in Kitty's eyes 
Eve never pleases me and Kitty can 
Eve never pleases me and Kitty can 
Ah, ah, ah ah ah 
Now Eve is bad and treats me cruel 
She loves to see me looking like a fool 
I find a way with words I say 
To be in love in such a lonely way 
Eve never pleases me and Kitty can 
Eve never pleases me and Kitty can 
Ah, ah, ah ah ah 
Now they are two and I am one 
I cannot fall in love with everyone 
So I must choose between the two 
Made up my mind, now I am choosing you 
Eve never pleases me and Kitty can 
Eve never pleases me and Kitty can 
Ah, ah, ah ah ah
