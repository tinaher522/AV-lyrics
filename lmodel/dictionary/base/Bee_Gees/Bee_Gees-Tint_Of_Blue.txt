<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="Tint_Of_Blue">
A tint of blue , deep down inside my heart, each time I see you 
It would take a lot to ease my pain from all these chains 
A tint of red , each time I see you with another 
Just because I was your lover , jealous I 
I get so angry I could cry 
A tint of blue , why do you make me feel so sad 
Why do you leave me feeling bad they way I do 
A tint of blue 
A tint of red , each time I see you with another 
Just because I was your lover, jealous I 
I get so angry I could cry
