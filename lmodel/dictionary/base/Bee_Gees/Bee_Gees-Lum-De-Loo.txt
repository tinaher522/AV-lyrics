<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="Lum-De-Loo">
I been the mayor in this old town
(lum-de lum-de-loo)
I am a woman's man , females all around
(lum-de lum-de-loo)
I'm respected , I am detested , lo
What they really don't know is
I shot a man in ellenburg, long long time ago
(lum-de lum-de-loo
Well, I'll be a lawman's piece of cake
(lum-de lum-de-loo)
But before they get me , my life I'll take
(lum-de lum-de-loo)
I'll be the biggest thing that's happened here
And that's the way it's gonna stay
'cause I love a woman in this town
I'm marrying her today
I'll be the biggest thing that's happened here
And that's the way it's gonna stay
'cause I love a woman in this town
Marrying her today ..
