<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="The_Way_It_Was">
I don't know how, but nights get lonely now
They keep appearing in my eyes
Such a warm and tender glow
For just one moment I remember all
The love we had was never all that bad
There were smiles and there were tears
On that special starry night, with your arms around me
Held on tight
Wasn't that the way it was?
Two strangers reaching for a worthless cause
Wasn't that the love we shared?
Or just the restless years when no-one cared
I don't know why, it's hard to say goodbye
Or even justify the end
You meant so very much to me
Then to let you go, start my life again
The love we had was never all that bad
There were smiles and there were tears
Till that special summer day
When I reached out for you, you just walked away
Wasn't that the way it was?
Two strangers reaching for a worthless cause
Wasn't that the love we shared?
Or just the restless years when no-one cared
When you move it like you really know how to move me
I follow you wherever you go
I just wan
