<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="Playdown">
I'm not a ghost , I am a man 
I only do the best I can 
Believin' I will find a way 
It's just a price that you must pay 
For my friends , they put me down 
So I go from town to town 
They all say that I'm a clown 
They play high and I play 
They play high and I play 
I play the game , I see the light 
I walk in day , you walk in night 
Believe me boy, it ain't no good 
In doin' what you never should 
All my friends, they put me down 
So I go from town to town 
They all say that I'm a clown 
They play high and I play down 
They play high and I play 
nah...... 
All my friends , they put me down 
So I go from town to town 
They all say that I'm a clown 
They play high and I play down 
They play high and I play
