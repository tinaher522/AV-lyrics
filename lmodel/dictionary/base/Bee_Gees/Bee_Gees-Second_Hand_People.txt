<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="Second_Hand_People">
See the cracks upon the wall 
We do not know the meaning of it all 
Ain't no fire to warm my feet 
Ain't got a nickel for a bit to ear 
We're not workin', we're not slavin' 
Ain't worth a brain, 'cause we're not worth savin' 
Second hand people, tall as a steeple 
Softer than treacle, in a pond are we 
Second hand people 
Ain't no mirror to comb my face 
Just keep on going from place to place 
Ain't got no lights above my head 
Don't even bother to leave my bed 
We're not livin' ,we're existin' 
We're not movin' ,just resistin' 
Second hand people, tall as a steeple 
Softer than treacle , in a pond are we 
Second hand people , tall as a steeple 
Softer than treacle ....
