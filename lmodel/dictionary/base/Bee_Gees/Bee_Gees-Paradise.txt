<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="Paradise">
Lonely people gathering there to be one
Gonna be the last time wasted
Gonna be seen to be gone
Run a mile for the minute
Gonna mind another day without you in it
And you
You promised me paradise
Don't go back on your word
No you
You promised me paradise
All my days of loving you under my skin
Gonna be a wild wild world
When nobody wants to give in
Gonna call me on the hour
Gonna mind if I don't hear it
I would hate to be you
You promised me paradise
Don't go back on your word
No you
You promised me paradise
Can you tell me if there's gonna be another reason to cry
Will I be the last to know
Unless we make another way of doing what we do
We won't believe it anymore
Will I be the one to cry
Problems,problems haunting me 
Circle my head
Gonna be a wild world
Let me hide away under your bed
Run a mile for the minute
Gonna mind another day without you in it
And you
You promised me paradise
Don't go back on your word
No you
You promised me paradise
You promised me paradise
(Ah..Ah.. Ah...)
You promised me paradise
