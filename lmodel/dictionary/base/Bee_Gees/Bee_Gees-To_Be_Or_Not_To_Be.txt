<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="To_Be_Or_Not_To_Be">
You build me up , you let me down 
How can I love , you give me no ground 
To be or not to be , to be ore not to be 
Am I gonna have you for me 
One little light I saw before 
The light in your eyes, I don't see no more
To be or not to be , to be or not to be 
Am I gonna have you for me , Well
Give me a chance . Make up your mind
Give me romance . Tell me you're mine 
To be or not to be ,well, to be or not to be 
Am I gonna have you for me , Well 
Well, to be or not to be 
Well, to be or not to be 
To be or not to be 
Am gonna have you for me 
Well, to be or not to be 
Well, to be or not to be 
To be or not to be 
Am gonna have you for me
