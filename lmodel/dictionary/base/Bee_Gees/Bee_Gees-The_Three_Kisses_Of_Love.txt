<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="The_Three_Kisses_Of_Love">
Kiss me once, oh yeah, baby.
Kiss me twice, oh yeah, crazy.
Kiss me three times
The three kisses of love, oh yeah.
Morning, noon, and at night,
Never gonna let you out of sight,
Kiss me three times
The three kisses of love.
Tell me that you really care.
I run your fingers through my hair.
Kiss me once,
Kiss me twice
And I'm in paradise.
Kiss me once, oh yeah, baby.
Kiss me twice, oh yeah, crazy.
Kiss me three times
The three kisses of love.
Tell me that you really care.
I run your fingers through my hair.
Kiss me once,
Kiss me twice
And I'm in paradise.
Kiss me once, oh yeah, baby.
Kiss me twice, oh yeah, crazy.
Kiss me three times
The three kisses of love,
The three kisses of love.
