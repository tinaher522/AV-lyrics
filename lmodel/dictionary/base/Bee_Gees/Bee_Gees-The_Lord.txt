<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="The_Lord">
What do you get for trying? Minute you're born you're dying.
The body is six feet down.The Lord says the soul sticks around.
You can believe what you wanna but I know what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna believe in the Lord.
You can believe what you wanna but I know what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna believe in the Lord.
You think you live on laughter. But you don't know what's after.
Singing Hallelujah. I can know the Master.
You can believe what you wanna but I know what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna believe in the Lord.
You can believe what you wanna but I know what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna believe in the Lord.
When my life is over. Lie in fields of clover.
Waiting for my own girl. Living in a new world . Yeah..
You can believe what you wanna but I know what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna believe in the Lord.
You can believe what you wanna but I know what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna believe in the Lord.
What do you get for trying? Minute you're born you're dying.
The body is six feet down.The Lord says the soul sticks around.
You can believe what you wanna but I know what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna believe in the Lord.
You can believe what you wanna but I know what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna believe in the Lord.
I'm gonna believe in the Lord.
