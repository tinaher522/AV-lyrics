<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="I_Started_A_Joke">
I started a joke
Which started the whole world crying
But I didn't see
That the joke was on me
Oh, no
I started to cry
Which started the whole world laughing
Oh, if I'd only seen
That the joke was on me
I looked at the skies
Running my hands over my eyes
And I fell out of bed
Hurting my head from things that I'd said
Till I finally died
Which started the whole world living
Oh, if I'd only seen
That the joke was on me
I looked at the skies
Running my hands over my eyes
And I fell out of bed
Hurting my head from things that I'd said
Till I finally died
Which started the whole world living
Oh, if I'd only seen, oh yeah
That the joke was on me, oh, no
That the joke was on me
Oh, oh, oh, oh
No, no, no
