<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="I_Don't_Wanna_Be_The_One">
It's too late to turn back now
There ain't no space back there
And how did I begin to lose my self control
How did I begin to lose my self control  
There ain't a thing that you could give me
With the love forever with me
That's the only thing that satisfies my soul
That's the only thing that satisfies my soul 
I don't wanna be the one
Remember it was only fun 
Two strangers touching in the sun, it had to end
I don't wanna be the guy to tell you things that make you cry
You know as well as I know , you're my only friend
There ain't a thing that you could give me
With the love forever with me
That's the only thing that satisfies my soul 
That's the only thing that satisfies my soul
I don't wanna be the one
Remember it was only fun
Two strangers touching in the sun, it had to end
I don't wanna be the guy to tell you things that make you cry
You know as well as I know ,you're my only friend
I don't wanna be the guy to tell you things that make you cry
You know as well as I know you're my only friend
You know as well as I know you're my only friend
You're my only friend
My only friend
My only friend
