<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="Just_In_Case">
Well, it seems every night and day, I get to lose
And I always held the faith inside 
That love would find a way
And I always reached for more than the others ever saw
I was always the first to follow my foolish prayer
And the feeling that I have is more than any soul could bear
Hold me when I wake
Then I can be sure of who I am
I'm half the man I should be, when you're gone

And you're telling me this is love, 
But just in case, keep my heart in a secret place
Safe under lock and key, 'til I know it's only me
One of us got to be the one that's true
One for the other and the love comes through
Right here or out in space
Give my heart to you, babe, but just in case
Yeah, just in case
Tell the world that I've come to claim your tomorrows
Let the universal word go out a million miles away
And let history show
On the wind the seed is sown
We are living in a time where the tears fall where they might
But we hear each other much more than those who see
We are not alone
Love is there for everyone who needs 
And for anyone who cries
I will always have you here with me
Ohh
And you're telling me this is love, 
But just in case, keep my heart in a secret place
Safe under lock and key 
'Til I know it's only me
One of us has got to be the one that's true
One for the other and the love comes through
Yours, mine, and face to face
Give my heart to you
But just in case
Yeah, just in case
Ahhh, ohhh baby, ahhh, ohhh, ohhh baby, ahhh
And you're telling me this is love, 
But just in case, keep my heart in a secret place
Safe under lock and key 
'Til I know it's only me
One of us has got to be the one that's true
One for the other and the love comes through
Yours, mine, and face to face
