<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="Songbird">
Go on with your song, bird -- you can't go wrong bird
You will go on and on, bird, like you did before
Though your wings are broken the sky is so wide open
And the wind is waiting for you like an open door
Though you go so far away, your voice will still be heard so well
You'll never really ever know how beautiful you are
When the moon is on the rise I'll try to make my songbird fly
I wonder if he ever will -- and if he really did, how  far
Go on with your song, bird -- you can't go wrong bird
You will go on and on, bird, like you did before
Though your wings are broken the sky is so wide open
And the wind is waiting for you like an open door
Though you go so far away, your voice will still be heard so well
You'll never really ever know how beautiful you are
When the moon is on the rise I'll try to make my songbird fly
I wonder if he ever will -- and if he really did, how  far
Go on with your song, bird -- you can't go wrong bird
You will go on and on, bird, through the open door
Go on with your song, bird -- you can't go wrong my bird
You will go on and on, bird, like you did before
Like you did before
