<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="Sincere_Relation">
George was born somewhere inside London town
Working as he grew for that extra pound.
Respected by all he married and made a home.
To give his children more then he had known. 
But then he died with out an explanation.
He never lied, a very sincere relation.
Years before a fire sent him in the street.
It took him months of work to make ends meet.
But then he died without and explanation.
He never lied, a very sincere relation.
