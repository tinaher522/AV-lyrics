<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="Starlight_Of_Love">
Hey, what is that , the moon I see
It belongs to you and me
We're gonna kiss so tenderly
Underneath the starlight of love , yeah
Underneath the starlight of love
Come on along and take my hand
And pretty soon you'll understand
I'm gonna be your lovin' man
Underneath the starlight of love , yeah
Underneath the starlight of love
We will sit together (together)
The moon and you and I (together)
We will sit , side by side
Watchin' little starlights flickin' by

Is that the moon I see
It belongs to you and me
We're gonna kiss so tenderly
Underneath the starlight of love , yeah
Underneath the starlight of love
We will sit together (together)
The moon and you and I (together)
We will sit , side by side
Watchin' little starlights flickin' by
Is that the moon I see
It belongs to you and me
We're gonna kiss so tenderly
Underneath the starlight of love , yeah
Underneath the starlight of love , yeah
Underneath the starlight of love
