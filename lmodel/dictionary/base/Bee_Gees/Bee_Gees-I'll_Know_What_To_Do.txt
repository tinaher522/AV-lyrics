<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="I'll_Know_What_To_Do">
I.......
If I fall in love , it's only with you
And if I call for love, it's got to be true
But if you fail . to keep it a tie
Then I'll know, it's only a lie
And I'll know what to do 
Oh, I'll know what to do 
If you wear my ring , you wear it for me
You've got to wear that thing indefinitely 
And if you're bad , even just for a while
I'll be sad , then I'll push you behind 
'cause I know what to do 
Oh I know what to do 
I.......
I am a man of words, the few words I say 
If you play my game , you play it my way
If you don't , one look in your eye
And I'll know, you're telling me lies 
And I'll know what to do 
I know what to do 
I.....
Oh I'll know what to do 
Oh I'll know what to do
