<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="Wish_You_Were_Here">
You're living your life 
In somebody else's heart 
My love is as strong 
As oceans are far apart. 
A summer song keeps playing in my brain, 
And I feel you, and I see your face again, 
There's no escape, 
I lost everything in losing you. 
Ah I wish you were here, 
Drying these tears I cry 
They were good times, 
And I wish you were here 
And calling my name, 
But you're dealing with a man insane, the cost, 
How hopelessly I'm lost, 
I tried to throw our love away 
And I can't let go. 
And so I awake 
In somebody else's dream 
(It's not what it seems) 
It's only a lie 
I've yet to decide who's real. 
The blood red rose will never never die 
It'll burn like a flame 
In the dark of the night 
I'm not afraid 
I'd give everything 
If you hear me there. 
Ahh I wish you were here, 
Drying these tears I cry 
They were good times, 
It's that time of year 
For being alone 
But you're dealing with a heart of stone 
Try to kiss and say goodbye 
Try to throw our love away 
And that storm will blow. 
Wish you were here. 
Wish you were here, 
'Cause you're dealing with a heart of stone 
Try to kiss and say goodbye 
Try to throw our love away 
And I can't let go. 
They were good times 
And I wish you were here, 
Yes, I wish you were here.
