<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="All_This_Making_Love">
About an hour or more, when I go upstairs, you can read between the lines
I can make it to the top, but then I gotta stop
But I'm all right, I'm really fine
It's just the wine and all this making love
In a day or so, it'll really show, gonna wear me to the ground
It's just the way it goes, she keeps me on my toes
But I'm all right, and should I mind
It's just the wine and all this making love
And I can't keep still, gonna make a will, 'cause I'm losing all my hair
I try to make it seem it isn't just a dream
And I'm all right, I'm almost there
It isn't fair to wake up all this making love
I get pleasure and pain, it's a gravy train, it's a wonderland, it's a ride
And the rumor is I'm told, she's really got a hold
And I'm all right, I'm really fine
It's just the wine and all this making love
She'll  be making me strung by the tip of my tongue like a tiger in a cage
She's got me up a wall, I'm slowing to a crawl
But I'm all right, I'm really fine
It's just the wine and all this making love.
Too much too much too much too much...
