<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="Coalman">
I tell my troubles to the coalman 
He's a coalman but he understands
He's not such a very very old man
He's a soul man and he takes my hand
He makes a man feel good when he's down
Head is touching the ground
He's going to help you if he can 
He's a coalman 
I've been waiting for the coalman
He's a whole man and he treats me nice 
Ev'rybody needs a coalman
When you're low man , you can get advice 
He makes a man feel good when he's down 
Head is touching the ground 
He's going to help you if he can 
He's a coalman
I need her loving so much the feeling is too much to bear
You've got to have somebody, when she's not there 
I tell my troubles to the coalman 
He's a coalman but he understands
He's not such a very very old man 
He's a soul man and he takes my hand
He makes a man feel good when he's down 
Head is touching the ground 
He's going to help you if he can 
He's a coalman
I need her loving so much the feeling is too much to bear
You've got to have somebody when she's not there 
I tell my troubles to the coalman
He's a coalman but he understands
He's not such a very very old man 
He's a soul man and he takes my hand
He's gonna help you when he's down 
When your head is touching the ground 
And he'll help you if he can 
He's a coalman 
Coalman, coalman , coalman
