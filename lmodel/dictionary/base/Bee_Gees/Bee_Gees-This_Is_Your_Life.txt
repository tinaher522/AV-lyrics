<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="This_Is_Your_Life">
Something that I hunger for
Something you deny
You say I'm bad for you
And baby so do I
Don't you know that all you gotta do
You could be a lover
And baby this is
This is your life
Don't break it
It's who you do it for
It's the pain and pleasure
This is your life
Temptation
A victim of the law
We can talk about it
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
This is your life
This is your life
If you try to help someone
You get the evil eye
You say you suffocate
Well baby so do I
Don't you know that all you gotta do
You could be a lover
And baby this is
This is your life
Don't hide it
Don't try to mystify
How soft the flesh is
This is your life
Get even, even if you die
Don't run for cover
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
This is your life
Temptation
That's who you do it for
It's the pain and the pleasure
This is your life
Temptation
A victim of the law
We can talk about it
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
This is your life
Define ourselves
As something in space
Not enough for everyone
Everyone and as we speak
The enemy is the mind
I see the future coming for you
All the lonely days and the lonely nights
You've been searching for a love so right
It's a tragedy just stayin' alive
Stayin' alive
And all that
Jive talking
What you doing on your back
Jive talking
More rap less crap
Times are bad, money is tight
Ain't too much heaven on
A Saturday night
Tell me now how deep is your love
The heart is soft
But the brain is tough
The enemy is the mind
Don't let the future fall apart
This is my world too, just run to me
If you ever wanna mend that broken heart
I have seen those nights on Broadway too
Blaming it all
What about you
This is your life
This is your life
Don't hide it
Don't try to mystify
How soft the flesh is
This is your life
It's who you do it for
It's the pain and pleasure
This is your life
Temptation
This is your life
