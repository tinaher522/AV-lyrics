<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="Whisper_Whisper">
Whisper, whisper. What have you got ? 
I got something that you need a lot .
Stop me and buy one.
You can see better but you better not.
Listen mister can you help me ?
It's my sister . Show her how to fly.
Stop me and try one. 
You can see ev'rything blowing by.
Whisper whisper. Keep it quiet.
If you like it you can try it too.
Stop me and buy one.
I am illegal that mean so are you 
Whisper whisper what have you got? 
I got something that you need a lot.
Stop me and buy one.
You can see better but you better not.
Whisper, whisper, whisper, whisper 
I am man and you are women. 
Who needs marriage? We are humans all.
If I could please you, arouse and ease you ,
then it would please you if I should call.
Doesn't matter what your name is. 
I can do a million things to you .
No explanations; sexual patience.
Most of the nation's doing it too.
No no no no no
