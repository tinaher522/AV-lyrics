<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="I_Lay_Down_And_Die">
Only last night when your arms held me tight
You told me you thought our love could last forever, forever
I was the one that gave you all the love when I thought
That our love could last forever, forever
I lay down and die
The whole world joins in
And everyone cries as teardrops begin
I lay down and die
And when darkness falls
Can't seem right there at all
I lay down and die
The whole world joins in
I lay down and die. the teardrops begin.
I lay down and die. and die. and die.
I lay down and die. the whole world joins in
I lay down and die and the teardrops begin
I lay down and die and I lay down and die
