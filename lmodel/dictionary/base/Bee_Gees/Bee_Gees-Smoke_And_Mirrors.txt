<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="Smoke_And_Mirrors">
When I was a boy, all the books I read
I followed like a blind man
To heed the words my father said
Those golden summers faded into night, words become a dream
The echoes of my childhood and where the path is winding
May God bless you, keep you safe from harm
I stand by you always
Time and motion
Hands touch, lips find a way to heaven on high
Watch the children play, the child becomes a man
And all the tangled webs we weave
You swear it as you live and breathe
We stay together, death until you part
Winner takes the prize
The future's at your fingertips, right before your eyes
No more sorrows
(smoke and mirrors)
No more nights with no end
(I really learned a lot, smoke and mirrors)
I see my tomorrows
And nothing from nothing
And ashes to ashes they say
All the more that you reach out
The more that it runs away
(Smoke and Mirrors)
No more goodbyes
(That's all I ever got, smoke and mirrors)
No lies, you find your way there
(Show me what she's got, smoke and mirrors)
Heaven on high
May God bless you, keep you from all harm
I stand my you always
Time and motion
(Smoke and mirrors)
Hands touch, lips find a way to
(That's all I ever got, smoke and mirrors)
Heaven on high
No more sorrows
(I really learned a lot, smoke and mirrors)
No more nights with no end
(Show me what shes got, smoke and mirrors)
I rise or I fall
No more goodbyes
(She really makes me hot, smoke and mirrors)
No lies, you find a way there
Heaven on high
