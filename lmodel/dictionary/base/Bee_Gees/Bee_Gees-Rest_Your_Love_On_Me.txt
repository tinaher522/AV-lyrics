<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="Rest_Your_Love_On_Me">
Maybe you don't know me anymore then I know you
And I wouldn't blame you if you walked away 
I been watchin' you all evenin' with the teardrops in your eyes
And it touches me much more then I can say
You know I'd hate to think that someone 
Could have hurt someone like you
And if I was him, I'd be right by your side 
Lay your troubles on my shoulders
Put your worries in my pocket 
Rest your love on me awhile
Lay your troubles on my shoulder
Put your worries in my pocket
Rest your love on me awhile
Saw you in the corner on the moment I walked in 
Saw your lonely face across the room 
No, I won't forget it
And the way it might have been 
Why did you have to leave so soon 
You know I'd hate to think that someone 
Could have loved you more than me
And at times like this I'd be right by your side
Lay your troubles on my shoulders
Put your worries in my pocket
Rest your love on me awhile
Lay your troubles on my shoulders
Put your worries in my pocket
Rest your love on me awhile
How long must I wait for the last train to be here
And the last chance to know
Get to think that I was born too soon
How long honey, when the lovin' don't come
I was there when you left me
Just didn't know how to begin
Lay your troubles on my shoulders
Put your worries in my pocket
Rest your love on me awhile
Lay your troubles on my shoulders
Put your worries in my pocket
Rest your love on me awhile
