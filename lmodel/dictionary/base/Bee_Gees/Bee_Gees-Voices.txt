<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="Voices">
Sweet voices calling wild, echoing around this child
Sweet Faith I'll be joining you, when my story's over
Dee doo doo doo dah dee doo doo 
doo doo doo dee doo doo doo dee doo dah day
Small secrets in the wind, blowing till the end begins
Oh my children stand by me till my story's over 
Dee doo doo doo dah dee doo doo
doo doo doo dee doo doo doo dee doo dah day
If I were you and you were me those voices they would cease to be
They won't be free to torment me again
But in my bed again last night, those voices spoke of wrong and right
They spoke of darkness and of light
They spoke of weakness and of might
The spoke of people in the snow
And distant places long ago
The spoke of fire and falling rain
Of health and wealth and death and pain 
Nah....

Of health and wealth and death and pain 
They spoke of people in the snow
And distant places long ago
They spoke of fire and falling rain 
Of health and wealth and death and pain
