<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="Monday's_Rain">
I can see the sun shinin' down on me 
Is it you my love that I can see 
Don't let me down 
Don't let me down 
Don't let me walk to Monday's rain (Monday's rain) 
To Monday's rain (Monday's rain) 
In this my life, I walk in light 
You are my love so baby I'm all right 
Don't let me down, baby 
Don't let me down 
Oh baby, please don't let me walk in Monday's rain (Monday's rain) 
In Monday's rain (Monday's rain) 
Ah.... 
Ev'ry man alive has got to have someone 
So what will I do when baby you are gone 
Don't let me down 
Don't walk on me 
My Sunday sunshine 
Hide Monday's rain (Monday's rain) 
Hide Monday's rain (Monday's rain) 
Monday's rain (Monday's rain) Ah...
