<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="Flesh_And_Blood">
I'm not that someone who's got what you want
I can do nothing but watch what you do 
You just want someone to kiss you good night
But lips are never enough to get you through
You stole my nights and you got your way
Now you got me dying inside , oh baby 
Ebony don't walk out on me
Listen to what I say
Pick up the pieces of my life into the night of day
How do you break this heart of steel
Nobody ever could
Open the pages of my life
I'm only flesh and blood
I'll be your Savior but baby I swear
I'm not living my life over you
Some satisfaction you get if you dare
But is it ever enough to get you through
You stole my mind and you watch me fall
Now you leave the scene of the crime,oh no
Ebony don't walk out on me
I never thought you could 
I'm only what you make of me
I'm only flesh and blood
I'm only flesh and blood
When you're gone , you'll be leaving behind,
a broken man with something to hide
Oh, lost in the night in a town without pity
You learn how to cry. You learn how to cry
Ebony don't walk out on me
Listen to what I say
Pick up the pieces of my life into the night of day
How do you break this heart of steel
Nobody ever could
Open the pages of my life
I'm only flesh and blood
Gone are the days that came and went
Houses are made of wood
Live in a world of sand and stone
I'm only flesh and blood
Ebony don't walk out on me
I never thought you could 
I'm only what you make of me
I'm only flesh and blood
