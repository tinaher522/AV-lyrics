<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="You_Won't_See_Me">
When I call you up
Your line's engaged
I have had enough
So act your age
We have lost the time
That was so hard to find
And I will lost my mind
If you won't see me
You won't see me
I don't know why 
You should want to hide
But I can't get through
My hands are tied
I won't want to stay
I don't gave much to say
But I can't turn away
And you won't see me
You won't see me
Time after time
You refuse to even listen
I wouldn't mind
If I knew what I was missing
Though the days are few
They're filled with tears
And since I lost you
It feels like years
Yes, it seems so long
Girl, since you've been gone
And I just can't go on
If you won't see me
You won't see me
Time after time
You refuse to even listen
I wouldn't mind
If I knew what I was missing
Though the days are few
They're filled with tears
And since I lost you
It feels like years
Yes, it seems so long
Girl, since you've been gone
And I just can't go on
If you won't see me
You won't see me
