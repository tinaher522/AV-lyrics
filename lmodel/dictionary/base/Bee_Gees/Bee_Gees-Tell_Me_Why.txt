<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="Tell_Me_Why">
If you think that you can hurt me and make my cry
Tell me why, tell me why , tell me why
And if you think that you can hurt me with lies that cry
Tell me why, tell me why, tell me why
Now I've got my reasons for feeling this way
Day after day and as nights go by
So, if you think my heart is broken and I might die
Tell me why, tell me why, tell me why
All of the world is as lonely as me
Day after day and as nights go by
So if you think my heart is broken and I might die
Tell me why, tell me why , tell me why
Tell me why , tell me why, tell me why
