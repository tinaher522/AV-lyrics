<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="When_The_Swallows_Fly">
I wander lonely as a cloud
I keep my head above the crowd
Ain't nobody else as big as me
But I must remember friends
What has to start just has to end
Everybody's got a destiny
And I know when the swallows flies
Yes I know, and the earth just dies
Then I'll be told what I am
The swallow and me
I'll look after number one
I'll forget the beggar's son
Everybody's got to stay alive
I'll keep a-walking amongst the clouds
I'll keep my head above the crowd
I'll watch them live, I'll watch them die
And I know when the swallows flies
Yes I know, and the earth just dies
Then I'll be told what I am
The swallow and me
And I know when the swallows flies
Yes I know, and the earth just dies
Yes I know when the swallow flies
Yes I know, and the earth just dies
