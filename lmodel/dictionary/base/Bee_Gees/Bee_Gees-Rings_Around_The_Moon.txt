<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="Rings_Around_The_Moon">
If you're lonely in the black of night
If you call me, I'll be there
I was falling and you helped me get it right
And I thank you girl, and I thank you
And I pray for the sign
And I won't be too late
If you just come down
I can look you in the eye
I can tell you that I love you
And my love will never die
And it's time that you know
Just how far I mean to go
We fly rings around the moon
We fly rings around the moon
We fly rings around the moon
We fly rings around the moon
Come tomorrow, candle burns
And I wake up by your side
All my sorrow, you made it disappear
And I thank you, and I thank you
And I lay down my life
And I won't be alone
If you just take time
And be sure of who you are
We can take it up to heaven
We can walk amongst the stars
And I know if you stay
I will never turn away
We fly rings around the moon
We fly rings around the moon
We fly rings around the moon
We fly rings around the moon
And I pray for the sign
And I won't be too late
If you just take time
And be sure of who you are
We can take it up to heaven
We can walk amongst the stars
And I know if you stay
I will never turn away
We fly rings around the moon
We fly rings around the moon
We fly rings around the moon
We fly rings around the moon
