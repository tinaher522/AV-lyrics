<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="The_Longest_Night">
You know a love so fine
So high above
Goes on forever but the road is rough
Reaching for another
As truth will show
Try to live without it
But you can't let go
We don't talk about it
We got no doubt
We can love each other when the lights go out
I got nobody, my bird has flown
Anyone can see I'm walking alone
Walking alone
In your quiet moments
In your silent prayer
I'll be with you baby
I'll be there
In your darkest hour
On your longest night
I'll be with you baby
Make it right
On your longest night
You know it breaks my heart
And it hurts my pride
To know I lost you to the world outside
Feeling when you touch me
They rise and fall
Try to live without it
Ain't no love at all
We don't talk about it
But somebody knows
We can love each other
When the candle glows
Open my eyes
And the moment is gone
Anyone can see
I'm walking alone
Walking alone
In your darkest hour
On your longest night
I'll be with you baby
Make it right
Nobody cries
Nobody cries, cries
For the pain I feel
Nobody knows, nobody knows
And it makes me wanna die
In your quiet moments
In your silent prayer
I'll be with you baby
I'll be there
In your darkest hour
On your longest night
I'll be with you baby
Make it right
On your longest night
