<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="Portrait_Of_Louise">
Summers come and summers go
But I still need the rain
All your vines will overgrow
and winds will blow insane
But I'm not goin' to  move
And I won't make you cry
You can shelter in my home
And I won't ask you why
Friends will come and friends will go
But you stay on my train
All your wines will overflow
As winds will blow insane
But I'm not goin' to  move
And I won't make you cry
You can shelter in my home
And I won't ask you why
You can shelter in my home
And I won't ask you why
