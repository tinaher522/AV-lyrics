<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="Angel_Of_Mercy">
Today I saw the sun
To rise to fall but can you forgive me
I sail upon this mortal storm
And hearts that cry and love is to leave me
We're miles apart
I know my aim is true
It keeps this flame from dying
I just stay alive
Angel of mercy
I know that I'll find you
So it's to my God in heaven that I pray
We can fly away
The voice is on the wind
I steal the stars, the course I must follow
No space or time, no sleep the soul
It lies awake, it craves to be near you
It drives me on
I know my aim is true
It keeps my flame from dying
We might live again
Angel of mercy
I know that I'll find you
So it's to my God in heaven that I pray
We can fly away
Sailing on a sea of gold
Where silver wings of angels go
I can see a million miles
That love goes on forever
Write a letter in the sand
That only lovers understand
And when the words are said and done
That we must come together
Sailing on a sea of gold
Where silver wings of angels go
I can see a million miles
That love goes on forever
