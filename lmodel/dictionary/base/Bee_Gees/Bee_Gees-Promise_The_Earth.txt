<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="Promise_The_Earth">
It's not worth one night on earth
Baby I know, baby I know
I won't know whose lips you're kissing
Baby I know
You don't know what you have done
Baby I know, baby don't go
You don't know what you are missing
Baby and so
There's not a sacrifice too strong
I've been alone for far too long
I'd be a fool to fail, I follow you
You must believe
Promise the earth
Give her the ocean
A kiss on the wind, goes straight to the heart
Promise the earth
With tears of emotion
If fate is a force that tears you apart
Please believe me, I would sell my soul for you
It's not too late
And we can turn back the time
Baby I know
I lay down with you in dreams
Baby I know, baby don't go
I was driven by this vision
Baby and so
If I could testify to you
Then I could prove my aim is true
If I am guilty or I'm innocent
You must believe
Promise the earth
Give her the ocean 
A kiss on the wind, goes straight to the heart (baby believe)
Promise the earth 
With tears of emotion
If fate is a force that tears you apart
You know I'm only human, so what am I supposed to say
'Course I'm gonna miss you, and curse the day you went away
What I would surrender, if I could make you turn around
The world we've got together, forever is on solid ground
Oooh, baby don't go
Baby don't go
Baby don't go
Baby
You're part of every dream
Before the dawn
You must believe
Promise the earth
Give her the ocean 
A kiss on the wind, goes straight to the heart (make her believe)
Promise the earth 
With tears of emotion
If fate is a force that tears you apart
Baby believe
Promise the earth
Give her the ocean 
A kiss on the wind, goes straight to the heart
Promise the earth
With tears of emotion
If fate is a force that tears you apart
Baby believe
Promise the earth
Promise the earth
Promise the earth
Promise the earth
You better believe
