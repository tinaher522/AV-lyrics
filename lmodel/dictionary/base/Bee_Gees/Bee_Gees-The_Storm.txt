<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="The_Storm">
Can you hear me
Are you near me
Can you see me
See me at all
Do you know me
Can you show me
If you hear me
Don't let me fall
Is it raining in the sunshine
And the wind blows in my eyes
Lying face down to the hard ground
I can face the cloudy skies
And although I maybe dying I will bide my love
I'll be waiting , I'll be waiting
I'll be waiting , in the storm
You were my girl in the springtime
With the sunshine in my day
Your sweet lips, your fingertips
And you touch me but you won't stay
Is it raining in the sunshine
And the wind blows in my eyes
Lying face down to the hard ground
I can face the cloudy skies
And although I may be dying I will bide my love
I'll be waiting , I'll be waiting
I'll be waiting , in the storm
Can you hear me
Are you near me
In the storm
