<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="Don't_Wanna_Live_Inside_Myself">
I am the searcher of my fortunes
I've got my right hand on the wheel
We've got to dig for buried treasures
I know exactly how I feel
Don't wanna live inside myself
I'm much better off alone
But then you must believe in the fallin' rain
Don't wanna live inside myself
I went walkin' through a graveyard
Where the darkness is my friend
I heard all about the beginning
I wanna see just where it ends
Don't wanna live inside myself
I'm much better off alone
But then you must believe in the fallin' rain
Don't wanna live inside myself
I have fed the jaded tiger
And every tiger knows my name
But just as long, as long as I can see my face
I can tell myself my name
Don't wanna live inside myself
I'm much better off alone
But then you must believe in the fallin' rain
Don't wanna live inside myself
