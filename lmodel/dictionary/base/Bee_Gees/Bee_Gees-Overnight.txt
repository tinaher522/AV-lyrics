<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="Overnight">
They say a fool never learns
You agree I'm not superstitious
You know unlucky as I've been
I'm still around
And you can tell me to go
I've been reading your true confessions
But then you don't believe I'd let
This chance go by I, I...
Show me inside
Sorry that I've been so far away
You know I'm only human
It's the call of the wild
It's the law of the jungle
Don't say no...
Wanna be with you
Won't you stay with me overnight
Give a little bit to you
Won't you stay with me stay
Pulling me to you
Won't you stay with me overnight
It'll be forever if you stay with me
Stay with me, stay...
As long as time will allow
You'll be losing your inhibitions
One night is not enough
For all the love to grow
And baby you and I rule the world
Maybe I could be your magician
Just give me long enough
My spell will hypnotize, I, I...
Show me inside
Live in every corner of your heart
You know I'm only human
It's the call of the wild
It's the law of the jungle
Don't say no...
Wanna be with you
Won't you stay with me overnight
Give a little bit to you
Won't you stay with me stay
Pulling me to you
Won't you stay with me overnight
It'll be forever if you stay with me
Stay with me, stay...
Stay with me overnight
Stay
Stay with me overnight
Stay
Stay with me overnight
Stay
Stay with me stay...
Stay with me stay...
Stay with me stay...
Stay with me stay...
