<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="Theme_From_"The_Travels_Of_Jaimie_McPheeters"">
From mountains high to valleys low, they speak the name of Jaimie-O 
Who with his pa, went searching for that gold in old California 
By riverboat and wagon train, old Doc McPheeters crossed the plains 
And told his son, keep moving on there's gold in old California 
Go westward ho, young Jaimie-O and you'll find fortune and fame 
And to this day when tales are told of pioneers a thousand fold 
McPheeters' name still shines like gold from Maine to old California 
Go westward ho, young Jaimie-O, and you'll find fortune and fame. 
And to this day when tales are told of pioneers a thousand fold 
McPheeters' name still shines like gold from Maine to old California 
From Maine to old California
