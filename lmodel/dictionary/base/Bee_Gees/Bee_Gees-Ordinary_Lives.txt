<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="Ordinary_Lives">
There'll be one small light
all over the world tonight.
The search go on for the one,
it will love with no name
and we glowed in the sun.
There was one small dream
incredible highs and lows,
what little we knew 
Living ordinary lives (lives),
Made a dream for you,
Living ordinary lives (lives)
Spoken:
Ordinary people living ordinary lives.
Ordinary people living ordinary lives.
We were ordinary people,
Living ordinary lives,
We were ordinary people,
Living ordinary lives
Spoken:
When the clock on the wall keeps movin',
Time stands still,
No matter how the dice may fall,
Someone else always get's to call the number
Say goodbye cruel world,
No pity, no pain tonight,
Whatever the cost all is lost,
If it is love with no name,
Then it's all in the stars,
Whether it's wrong or right,
There's no one to blame no lies,
What else could we do
Living ordinary lives (lives),
Made a dream for you,
Living ordinary lives (lives),
ohohoh
We were ordinary people,
Living ordinary lives,
We were ordinary people,
Living ordinary lives,
We were ordinary people,
What else could we do
Living ordinary lives (lives),
Made a dream for you,
Living ordinary lives (lives),
ohohoh (ohohoh)
We were ordinary people,
Living ordinary lives,
We were ordinary people,
Living ordinary lives,
We were ordinary people,
Living ordinary lives,
...
