<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="The_End">
At the end of a rainbow,
You'll find a pot of gold
At the end of a story,
You'll find it's all been told
But our love has a treasure our hearts always spend
And it has a story without any end
At the end of a river,
The water stops its flow
At the end of a highway, there's no place you can go
But just tell me you love and you are only mine
And our love will go on till the end of time
At the end of a river, the water stops its flow
At the end of a highway, there's no place you can go
But just tell me you love and you are only mine
And our love will go on till the end of time
Till the end of time
