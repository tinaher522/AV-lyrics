<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="Children_Of_The_World">
Ah ah ah ah 
We are children of the world , 
Watching every day go by. 
Changes my life, changes your life, 
Keeps us all anticipating. 
Ah ah ah ah 
We are searchers of the truth, 
Every man's a boy deep down. 
Gotta say it how you mean it, 
There ain't no easy way. 
Like a bird in the wind, 
Like a tree in the storm, 
Like the breath of a child 
From the moment he's born 
To the very last day 
When the curtains are drawn. 
Ah ah ah ah 
We are children of the world 
Asking every question why, 
From arrival to survival 
Just to make it worth the waiting. 
Ah ah ah ah 
We are faces in the night 
Watching every day go by. 
Changes my life, changes your life, 
There ain't no easy way. 
In the back of your mind 
There is always a mark. 
There's a wandering solo 
Alone in the dark. 
You can keep it forever 
Or tear it apart. 
Ah ah ah ah 
We are children of the world 
Watching every day go by. 
Changing my life, changing your life, 
Keeps us all anticipating. 
Ah ah ah ah 
We are children of the world 
Watching every day go by. 
Like a bird in the wind, 
Like a tree in the storm, 
Like the breath of a child 
From the moment he's born 
Till the very last day 
When the curtains are drawn. 
Ah ah ah ah 
We are children of the world 
Watching every day go by. 
Changes my life, changes your life, 
Keeps us all anticipating. 
Ah ah ah ah 
We are children of the world 
Watching every day go by. 
Changes my life, changes your life, 
Keeps us all anticipating.
