<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="Omega_Man">
We set the same scene
Circumstances different than they
Might have been
People in two places can be
Pulled into a scheme
Never what you're fighting for
Life alone
Lose a lover's arms
Never makes it easy when you try too hard
I wish you would define what you feel
Hard on or letting go
I'm the Omega Man
Stand tall and understand
Everybody needs a plan
Mine is a better way
There'll be trouble in the world
Sex and the single girl
I'm an over-eager man
Find me a better way
Find me a better way
We share the same pain
Underneath the covers I will set you free
I will prove to you my love is
Older than the sky
Stronger than the night is long
Lord of hearts
Leader of us all
Let it be together if we rise or fall
Or is it just my imagination
Or the light of a precious stone
(You'll never be alone)
I'm the Omega Man
I travel over land
Everybody needs a plan
Find me a better way
There'll be trouble in the world
Sex and the single girl
I'm an over-eager man
Find me a better way
Find me a better way
Here at the scene of the crime
Laid in your arms I will die
I know it's more than infatuation
That's keeping this man alive
I'm the Omega Man
Stand tall and understand
Everybody needs a plan
Mine is a better way
There'll be trouble in the world
Sex and the single girl
I'm an over-eager man
Find me a better way
Find me a better way
I'm the Omega Man
I travel over land
Everybody needs a plan
Find me a better way
There'll be trouble in the world
Sex and the single girl
I'm an over-eager man
Find me a better way
Find me a better way
