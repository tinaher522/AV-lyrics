<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="Dearest">
I hear you calling me 'dearest' too .
My dearest, I'm nearest, then I've ever been before
To have you calling me 'dearest' once more.
My dearest, this picture, my own memory.
Wishing this picture was reality.
Where do I go from here? The Lord took you away.
And if you could see my today, I will remember you .
I will remember you 
My dearest, sincerest, there's no one but you and 
Here in my heart you're my dearest too.
Where do I go from here? The Lord took you away.
And if you could see me today, I will remember you. 
I will remember you.
My dearest, sincerest, there's no one but you and 
here in my heart you're my dearest too.
