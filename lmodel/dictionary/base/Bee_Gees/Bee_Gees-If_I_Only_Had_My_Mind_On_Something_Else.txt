<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="If_I_Only_Had_My_Mind_On_Something_Else">
I could be king of kingsÂ ; wear a crown and all the things 
I'd want I'd never need.
I'd be an ace in an aeroplane and every year I'd fly to Spain.
If I could get the nerve to plant the seed.
Oh, tell me how to say goodbye.
I see her face in myself.
Why, tell me why I made her cry
If only had my mind on something else.
Captain of the submarine beneath the icebergs never seen.
A hero with a medal for ev'ryday.
I find me fame,reach the top.
I keep on pushing never stop.
If I could just forget her name.
Oh, tell me how to say goodbye.
I see her face in myself.
Why, tell me why I made her cry
If only had my mind on something else.
If only had my mind on something else.
