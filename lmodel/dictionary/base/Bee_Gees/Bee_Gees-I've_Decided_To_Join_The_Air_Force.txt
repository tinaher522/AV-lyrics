<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="I've_Decided_To_Join_The_Air_Force">
Mother, I'm going to join the air force today.
I don't care what the neighbors may say,
But I'm going to join the air force today.
Mother, I don't care what my father might think.
Perhaps it's going to drive him to drink.
But I don't care what my father might think.
Don't ask me why, it's my mind and it's right.
Don't ask me why, it's my mind ,
It's better, it's better than being alone,
Alone on the ground. now I find
Mother, I've got to join the air force you see,
I've seen my friends and they all agree
That's it's better than joining the army or going to sea
Mother, I've go to join the air force you see
I've seen my friends and they all agree.
That's it's better then joining the army or going to sea.
Mother, mother, mother.
