<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="Wine_And_Women">
Wine and women and song will only make me sad. 
Love and kisses and hugs, the things I never had. 
If this should end, I don't mind. 
If this should end, I will find. 
What shall I do (what shall I do). 
What shall I do (what shall I do). 
Cars and buses and trams make a lot of noise. 
All my women have gone out with other boys. 
If this should end, I don't mind. 
If this should end, I will find. 
I won't complain (I won't complain). 
I feel no pain (I feel no pain). 
Ooh.. 
If this should end, I don't mind. 
If this should end, I will find. 
I won't complain (I won't complain). 
I feel no pain (I feel no pain). 
Wine and women and song will only make me sad. 
Love and kisses and hugs, the thing I never had. 
If this should end, I don't mind. 
If this should end, I will find. 
I won't complain (I won't complain). 
I feel no pain (I feel no pain). 
I won't complain, cry.
