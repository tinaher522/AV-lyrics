<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="Timber">
When I first saw you standing there, you set my heart a-reeling
Baby, you gave me such a feeling 
My heart cries timber, timber, timber, timber 
Timber baby 'cause I'm a a-fallin' for you 
Yeah, yeah, yeah 
Well, it happens ev'ry time I look in your eyes 
Baby, it's paradise 
My heart cries timber, timber, timber, timber 
Timber baby 'cause I'm a-fallin' for you 
Yeah, yeah, yeah 
Well, I wish that you were mine to be forever and ever
Without you darling I just can't sleep 
I'm only happy when we're together 
I guess it's time that I told you so 
I'll always want to hold you 
Baby, have I ever told you 
My heart cries timber, timber, timber, timber 
Timber baby 'cause I'm a-fallin' for you 
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I wish that you were mine to be forever and ever 
Without you darling I just can't sleep 
I'm only happy when we're together 
I guess it's time that I told you so 
I'll always want to hold you
Baby, have I ever told you 
My heart cries timber, timber, timber, timber 
Timber baby 'cause I'm a-fallin' for you 
Whoa, whoa, whoa 
Timber baby 'cause I'm a-fallin' for you
Whoa, whoa, whoa 
Timber baby 'cause I'm a-fallin' for you
