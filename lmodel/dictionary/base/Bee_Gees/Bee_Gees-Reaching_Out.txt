<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="Reaching_Out">
Watching ev'ry day go by , living in a foolish game
Just the way I feel today 
Living my life without you
Never hear a single word , living in a lullaby
Praying ev'ry tear I cry 
Living my life without you 
And ev'rywhere you go I fly (I love you with a special feeling)
And darling till the day I die (baby never stop believing)
I'll be reaching out, I'll be reaching out , Ahh....
Reaching out (there's a woman goin' through me)
I'll be reaching out ( got a chance to hold you to me ) Ahh..
Ev'rything is lonely and I need you
Living my life forever , forever
Watching ev'ry day go by
Living on the one I love 
What I got is not enough 
Living my life without you
And I believe in yesterday (yesterday was once tomorrow)
With love, with love wide open ev'ry way(baby you're the light I follow)
I'll be reaching out , I'll be reaching out , Ahh 
Reaching out (there's a woman going through me)
I'll be reaching out (got a chance to hold you to me)
Ev'rything is lonely and I need you
Living my life forever
I'll be reaching out 
I'll be reaching out 
Reaching out 
I'll be reaching out 
Living my life forever
Reaching out , I'll be reaching out
