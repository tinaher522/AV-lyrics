<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="2_Years_On">
One year, two years, time goes by.
People laugh and people cry.
Ev'ry morning the clock strikes eight.
I go to work. I close the gate.
And on my way, I sing a song.
About my wife, where I belong.
If the clouds get together and talk about the weather
If it's rain they anticipate
Baby make no mistake
Yes the storm will break but never me you see.
Two years on. Two years on.
But only you can see me.
Only you can see me.
For what I've got
Sir lancelot was just a dream and I am not
For I am he with something more
It's you and I reality.
If the cloud get together and talk about the weather
If it's rain they anticipate
Baby, make no mistake
Yes the storm will break but never me you see
Two years on. Two years on.
But only you can see me
Only you can see me
Two years on. Two years on.
Ah...
