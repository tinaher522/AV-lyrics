<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="Don't_Say_Goodbye">
Please believe me, I will never be untrue
And don't believe the jealous lies they told to you 
Oh no, don't go, don't make this poor boy cry 
I'll be true, I beg of you, don't say goodbye 
Now don't you know I love you more than I can say
And it would mean my life if you should run away
Oh no, don't go, don't make this poor boy cry
I'll be true, I beg of you, don't say goodbye
You just won't listen to my pleas
You want me beggin' on my knees
So sit right down and listen while I beg, you see
I'll never be untrue, so please believe in me
Oh no, don't go, don't make this poor boy cry
I'll be true, I beg of you, don't say goodbye
I'll be true, I beg of you, don't say goodbye
