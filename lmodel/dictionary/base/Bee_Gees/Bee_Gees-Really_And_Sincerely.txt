<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="Really_And_Sincerely">
My mind is open now, I'm on the other side.
Though you remember my name. 
And if you go away I'll get it off somehow.
I'll leave it all in the air. No,no.
Turn me down. Turn me down
Turn me down. Oh, how I've tried.
Really and sincerely I've tried.
There is a song, I hear it all around.
But I don't hear a sound.
If you were with me now,I'd let you know my mind.
Love is so easy to lose. No,no.
Turn me down. Turn me down.
Turn me down. Oh, how I've tried.
Really and sincerely.
Turn me down. Turn me down.
