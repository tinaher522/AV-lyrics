<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="Where_Are_You?">
Where are you (where are you) 
Night is day and day is night 
Where are you (where are you) 
Need you girl you re not in sight 
Our love would grow, but you leave and I know 
That you don't love me (where are you) 
I need you girl, you're not in sight 
I told you (I told you) 
I was never coming back -ah 
You told me (You told me) 
You would give my love the sack-ah 
Now as I fly, you won't tell me goodbye 
Cause you don't love me (where are you) 
Now you give my love the sack-ah 
Now as my heart lies in pieces of eight 
You were a part of my love but too late 
I love you (I love you) 
This I think that you should know 
I' ll be blue (I'll be blue) 
You are still cause I must 
I'd like to stay but I know you won't play 
And see things my way (where are you) 
You are still cause I must go 
You are still cause I must 
I must go (where are you)
