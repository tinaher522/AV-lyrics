<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="Swan_Song">
This is my swan song. 
Whatever I do now, I do it well. 
This is my swan song. 
I fell in love with you I love you well. 
And if the Lord provides the music for the world around to sing, 
My love will build a castle in the air. 
This is my last chance, 
A chance to show the world that I am strong. 
This is my last dance. 
I'm walking off the floor where I belong. 
And if the Lord provides the music for the world around to sing, 
My love will build a castle in the air. 
La...
And if the Lord provides the music for the world around to sing, 
My love will build a castle in the air. 
This is my swan song. 
I fell in love with you, 
I love you well, 
I love you well, 
I love you well
