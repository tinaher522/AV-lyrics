<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="Heartbreaker">
I've got to to say it and it's hard for me
You got me crying like I thought I would never be
Love is believing but you let me down
How can I love you when you ain't around
And I get to the morning and you never call
Love should be everything or not at all
And it don't matter whatever you do
I made a life out of loving you
Only to find that the dream that I follow is dying
I'm crying in the rain
I could be searching my world for a love everlasting
And feeling no pain, when will we meet again?
Why do you have to be a heartbreaker?
This is a lesson that I never knew
Got to get out of the spell that I'm under, my love for you
Why do you have to be a heartbreaker?
When I was being what you want me to be
Suddenly everything I ever wanted has passed me by
This world may end, not you and I
My love is stronger than the universe
My soul is cryin' for you and that can not be reversed
You made the rules and you could not see
You made a life out of hurting me
Out of my mind I am held by the power of you love
Tell me when do we try, why should we say goodbye?
Why do you have to be a heartbreaker?
This is a lesson that I never knew
Got to get out of the spell that I'm under, my love for you
Why do you have to be a heartbreaker?
This is a lesson that I never knew
Got to get out of the spell that I'm under, my love for you
Why do you have to be a heartbreaker?
When I was being what you want me to be
Suddenly everything I ever wanted has passed me by
