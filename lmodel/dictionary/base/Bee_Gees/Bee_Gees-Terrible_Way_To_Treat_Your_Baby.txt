<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="Terrible_Way_To_Treat_Your_Baby">
I know that she loves you now
But your heart doesn't keep any vows
And that's a terrible way to treat your baby
A terrible way to hurt that girl
It's a terrible way you treat your baby
When you know that I love her
More than anything in this world
Her heart isn't for a game
So tell her , you don't feel the same
For that's a terrible way to treat your baby
A terrible way , you hurt that girl
It's a terrible way you treat your baby
When you know that I love her
More than anything in this world
Oh, so sad ,leaving her behind
And if you give me the chance to take her hand
And try to change her mind
For it's a terrible way to treat your baby
A terrible way you hurt that girl
It's a terrible way to treat your baby
When you know that I love her
More than anything in this world
For it's a terrible way to treat your baby
A terrible way you hurt that girl
It's a terrible way to treat your baby
When you know that I love her
More than anything in this world
