<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="Road_To_Alaska">
I'm on the road to Alaska, nowhere near Nebraska,
but I'm sure if I asked her she'll know.
I ain't got no Honey, I'm so short of money.
I really really wanna go home.
I dialed Oklahoma, made attempts to phone her,
gave up when I got no reply. 
I'm on the road to Alaska, nowhere near Nebraska,
but I'm sure if I don't ask her I'll die.
I found Cincinnati, out there I was happy, every single day of my life.
I had me a woman, she started to runnin' .
I really couldn't make her my wife.
She started to show which was she was goin', every single road she could go  
I'm on the road to Alaska, nowhere near Nebraska
but I'm sure if I asked her she'll know 
I made Cincinnati, out there I was happy, every single day of my life.
I had me a woman, she started to runnin'. 
I really couldn't make her my wife.
She started to show which was she was goin' , every single road she could go
I'm on the road to Alaska, nowhere near Nebraska
but I'm sure if I asked her she'll know.
I'm sure if I ask her she'll know.
I'm sure if I ask her she'll know.
