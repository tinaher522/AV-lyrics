<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="The_Bridge">
When I was young I dreamed of you
Far and away, my dreams come true
Now I know what love has done
Children of mine, we all are one
When I was young I looked to you
You were the world I never knew
Through the years we all have grown
Knowing your love forever strong
Would you walk away if I raised my voice?
Do you think I taught you well?
Time after time after time
In younger days I felt for you
With all the pain that we went through
We believe the one above
Father and Son, forever love
Hand in hand, the future's here
Now that we crossed the bridge of tears
Finding truth and facing fears
We can walk on, the road is clear
Walk across the bridge
Take my hand
Walk across the bridge
Come to me
Would you walk away if I raised my voice?
Do you think I taught you well?
Time after time after time
Walk across the bridge
Come to me
Walk across the bridge
You'll never be far away
You'll never be far away
You'll never be far away
