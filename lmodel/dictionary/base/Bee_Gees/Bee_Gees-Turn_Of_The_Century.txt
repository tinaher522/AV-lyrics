Ev'rythings happening 
At the turn of the cent'ry. 
I'm gonna buy myself a time machine 
go to the turn of the cent'ry. 
And all those people passing by 
And the town crier makes his cry 
At the turn of the cent'ry, 
Turn of the cent'ry. 
Big wide hats and men is spats 
At the turn of the cent'ry. 
With those horseless carriages 
At the turn of the cent'ry. 
And there are lots of things to do 
on a bicycle built for two 
At the turn of the cent'ry, 
Turn of the cent'ry. 
Ev'rythings happening 
At the turn of the cent'ry. 
I'm gonna buy myself a time machine 
go to the turn of the cent'ry. 
And all those people passing by 
And the town crier makes his cry 
At the turn of the cent'ry, 
Turn of the cent'ry. 
Turn of the cent'ry.
