<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="I_Don't_Think_It's_Funny">
You get your pleasures out of hurting me , honey 
You get your kicks out of watching me cry
You play around an awful lot to hurt me , honey 
Why do you laugh when there are tears in my eyes 
I don't think it's funny , honey 
My skies are not so sunny 
Why don't you make up your mind
Let me put my arms around you 
Make rainbows all around you 
But I don't know if you are mine
If I was yours and you were mine , my little honey
We could be happy till the very day I die
But all you ever want to do is hurt me , honey
Why do you laugh when there are tears in my eyes 
I don't think it's funny , honey
My skies are not so sunny 
Why don't you make up your mind
Let me put my arms around you 
Make rainbows all around you 
But I don't know if you are mine
I don't think it's funny , honey 
My skies are not so sunny 
Why don't you make up your mind 
Let me put my arms around you 
Make rainbows all around you 
But I don't know if you are mine
But I don't know if you are mine 
But I don't know if you are mine
