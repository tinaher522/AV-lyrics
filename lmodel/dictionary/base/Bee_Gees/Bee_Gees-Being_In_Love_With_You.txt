<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="Being_In_Love_With_You">
I thought I'd already touched the sky
I got to know you and I don't know why
But all of my life couldn't mean as much
As just being touched by you
I never thought of me growing up
Got my directions but the road was rough
It's only the dream of a teenage queen
But somehow I made it through
And I'd love to see
Those faces of those friends I left behind
And even those who spoke for me
Just trying to be kind
And no one said I love you just the way
I know you do
* and I love being in love with you
Living inside your heart
The giving and the taking
You are not forsaken
I love being in love with you

Thank you just for choosing me
That we should be
Being in love forever
I stare and wonder at what I found
I just discovered why the world is round
Round in a circle my arms will be
And doing the same as you
It ain't right it's only for you and me
Only the lonely so it seperately
Keep it alive on the food of love
But only the chosen few
In my life you see some changes in me
We listen and we grow
Any child that clings to childish things
Is trying to let go
And up to now
I'd thought I'd seen as far as I could see
(repeat * twice and fade out)
