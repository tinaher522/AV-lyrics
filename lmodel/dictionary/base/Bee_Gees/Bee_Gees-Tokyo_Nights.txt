<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="Tokyo_Nights">
You're crossing the water
For eastern delights,
'cause now that you're gone
I feel like a stranger in new york tonight.
And the rhythm was new to me,
Tokyo nights
Well she came in the night,
And she came in the night.
And the vision was true to me,
Tokyo nights.
Well she came for the moment
And stayed till the end wee ah.
Take me to tokyo.
Ooh wee ah.
Take me to tokyo.
I was lonely in western days
Tokyo nights
Well she took me away, by saving life
I was down in the rising sun
Tokyo night
Well I came for the moment, and
Stayed till the end. (ooh)
Take me to tokyo.
Ooh wee ah.
Take me to tokyo.
You're crossing the water
For eastern delights,
'cause now that you're gone
I feel like a stranger in new york tonight.
I am calling you,
Take me to tokyo,
Ooh wee ah.
Take me to tokyo.
Ooh wee ah.
