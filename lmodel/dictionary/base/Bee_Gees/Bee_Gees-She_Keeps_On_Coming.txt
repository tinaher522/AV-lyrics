<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="She_Keeps_On_Coming">
Front and centre
I don't know how it happened then
I can't explain it
What was she thinking of when
Mother Nature
She put us both together, and
The way she touched me 
And I ran that red light and so I
Said I love her
She tell me I don't matter
I try to kiss her
But every dream is shattered
No early warning
Except the morning after
Look in the mirror like a rabbit in the headlights
She keeps on coming back for more
She keeps on coming back for more
She keeps on coming back for more
Champagne and roses
Breakfast in bed
Wrapped in each other
And out of my head
She keeps on coming back for more
She keeps on coming back for more
Oh no
Oh no
Yeah
Oh no
She ain't no Cleopatra
I ain't no Julius Caesar
I ain't no Casanova
She ain't no Mona Lisa
She charm a nation
She send you out to die
And we were flying when she ran that red light
I ain't no Valentino
She ain't no Greta Garbo
No Aphrodite
I'll never be Apollo
But when we come together
There's no one else can follow
There's no tomorrow when we run that red light
She keeps on coming back for more
She keeps on coming back for more
She keeps on knocking at the door
Drunk on desire
Erotic delights
Sooner or later, she'll kiss you goodnight
She keeps on coming back for more
She keeps on coming back for more
Oh no
Oh no
Oh no
Oh no
Midnight
Die in the arms of a lover
Hold tight
I close my eyes and she's gone
Dream time
She's mine
Always here
Small town
Daytime
Disappear
She keeps on coming back for more
She keeps on coming back for more
She keeps on coming back for more
Drunk on desire
Erotic delights
Sooner or later, she'll kiss you goodnight
But she keeps on coming back for more
She keeps on coming back for more
She keeps on knocking at the door
She keeps on coming back for more
She keeps on coming back for more
