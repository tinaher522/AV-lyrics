<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="Just_One_Look">
Just one look and I felt so wild
Felt so wild in love with you
I found out how good it feels
Just how good to have your love
Say you will, you will be mine
You'll be mine forever and always
Just one look and I knew
That you were my only one
I thought I was dreaming
But I was so wrong
But I'm gonna keep on scheming
Till I can make you all of my own
So you see I really care
Without you I'm nothing
Just one look and I know
I'll get you someday
Just one look
That's all it took
