<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="Come_On_Over">
If my life gets like a jig saw
With the pieces out of place,
Come on over,
Put a smile back on my face.
And if all my bad days came at once
You would know just what to do.
Come on over; 
Baby, you will see me through.
And if you think I need you, 
Come on over.
Bring your love around;
You can dry away my tears.
And if you think I need you,
Come on over.
Lay your body down;
You know I will be here.
So bring your love around.
When I can not see in front of me
You would know my darkest day,
Come on over;
You can take it all away. 
And if you think I need you, 
Come on over.
Bring your love around;
you can dry away my tears.
And if you think I need you,
Come on over.
Lay your body down;
You know I will be here.
So bring your love around.
Come on over here.
