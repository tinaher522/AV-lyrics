<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="Throw_A_Penny">
Little child , I have found
If I stood up and looked around
I'd see a brand new face staring right back at me
I believe, I am sure
That I'm taller then I was before
Building a brand new bridge into sincerity
But it's the times like this, we must learn to grow
Throw a penny for my children, they are going down
When the light shines down much brighter, many souls are found
And  can't believe what they're saying in the overground
Throw a penny for my children going down
Listen to the wise man as he breathes
He's really loving me (loving me)
He must be loving me (loving me)
At night I turn my face into the wind
And I whisper secretly, what means the most to me
And bring him close
Make it bad, make it good
Make it easy to be understood
I see a velvet day breaking across the sky
I believe, I am sure
I am taller then I was before
Building a brand new bridge
I know I'm gonna try 
But it's the times like this, we must find out why
Throw a penny for my children they are going down 
When the light shines down much brighter, many souls are found
And I can't believe what they're saying in the overground
Throw a penny for my children going down
Throw a penny for my children, for my children going down 
Throw a penny for my children, for my children going down 
Throw a penny for my children, for my children going down 
Throw a penny for my children, for my children going down
