<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="Another_Cold_And_Windy_Day">
Another cold and windy day
The birds are homing, to come to stay
And as I feel my mind is turning
And think of times when i were glad
I open up some Coke and smile
And then my minds free for a while
Things go better with Coca-Cola
Things go better with Coke
Voiceover:
The Bee Gees reminding you that Coke has that taste yo'll never get tired of
