<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="I_Am_The_World">
I'm the sun, I'm the falling rain 
I'm the kind of man you can't explain 
True love is one thing I've been dreaming of 
I give my love to you. And when I do 
you are to me, the very deepest part of me 
I am the world 
I am the sky 
I am the sea
I'm anything that you want me to be 
When you hurt me, then I become the night time
The shadows in my eyes don't make it good for
me to see the way I should 
I am the world
I am the sky 
I am the sea
I'm anything that you want me to be 
I'm the sun, I'm the falling rain 
I'm the kind of man that you can't explain 
I am the world 
I am the world
