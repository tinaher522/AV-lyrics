<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="Give_A_Hand,_Take_A_Hand">
I wish the world was run by all the little children
We could be happy once again
We won't hurt when we're like little children
And we won't ever feel the pain 
Now when my fight for life on earth is over
And I leave 'cause I can't stay
All my love belongs to you hereafter
And we'll all join hand another day
Ev'rybody's got to give a hand
Ev'rybody's got to take a hand
Ev'rybody's got t fall in love , yeah
To make ev'rybody understand
Ev'rybody's got to give , take a hand
I love you , yes I do 
I told you a million times now
Now do you believe the words I say
All my life belongs to you hereafter
And we'll all join hands another day
Ev'rybody's got to give a hand
Ev'rybody's got to take a hand
Ev'rybody's got to fall in love , yeah
To make ev'rybody understand
Ev'rybody's got to give , take a hand
Ev'rybody's got to give a hand
Ev'rybody's got to take a hand
Ev'rybody's got to fall in love , yeah 
To make ev'rybody understand
Ev'rybody's got to give, take a hand
