<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="Soldiers">
I memorize, I walk in line
Carry my sacrifice for the sake of the millions
All night you be the light on the water
You be the pride and the sorrow
Shower your love to me there
Summer died before the rain
Unify every soul together be lonely
Ride on follow me to the sunrise
Save me the world that is broken
Nothing but love to be there
Soldiers, father and son
We're soldiers, nowhere to run
We fight or we die
For what are we livin' for?
Boys never cry
Soldiers, mother and child
We're soldiers ,the meek and the mild
We stand or we fall
Never mind,dry your eyes
You'll never be far away
Forever beside me
Hold out, I will be your tomorrow
I will walk through the fire
Nothing but love to be there
Soldiers, father and son
We're soldiers,nowhere to run
We fight or we die
For what are we living' for
Boys never cry
Soldiers, mother and child
We're soldiers, the meek and the mild
We stand or we fall
I'm a little misunderstood
Living all the daydreams and nightmares
Don't do me no good
I'm a little bit on the moon
But when the word is - you love me
No moment is too soon
All night give me the light on the water
Give me the pride and the sorrow
Showing your love to me there
Soldiers, father and son
We're soldiers,nowhere to run
We fight or we die
For what are we livin'for?
Boys never cry
Soldiers, mother and child
We're soldiers, the meek and the mild
We stand or we fall
Soldiers, father and son
We're soldiers, nowhere to run
We fight or we die
For what are we livin' for?
Boys never cry  
Soldiers, father and son
We're soldiers, nowhere to run
We fight or we die
For what are we livin' for?
Boys never cry
