<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="I_Could_Not_Love_You_More">
Now that we're alone 
No more hide and seek 
You are the highest dream to me 
And as you softly sleep 
Then I can tell you what it means 
Locked in my arms like lovers lie 
I will not let you slip away 
I sthis the summer of them all 
Is this my night of nights 
That you came to stay 
Here you are, owner of my heart 
Just the way that love should be 
And there is something I must say to you 
If you promise to believe 
That it's you I'm living for 
And, I could not love you more 
Seasons may come and seasons go 
But these are the truest words I know 
Face to face, eye to eye 
This is the summer of our lives 
One love that cannot die 
Here you are, owner of my soul 
Never let you say goodbye 
And there is something I must say to you 
We leave the world outside 
And you have come to me at last, we start 
Open up your heart 
Let my deepest love inside 
I'm only doing what I have to do 
If you promise to believe 
That it's you I'm living for 
And, I could not love you (more)
