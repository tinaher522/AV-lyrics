Wildflower
Sacrifice everything in a wonderland that you know
It's crazy that I'm clear out of my mind
A wonderful place to be
Wildflower
Sweet as the morning light 
if I blink an eye will you go
I'm starting to care much more then I dare
A wonderful thing to see
And what do we know
First say you love me
And then say you leave me
But we never say goodbye
God you're an angel 
But even an angel must choose
Someone will hurt you and when you stop running
There's only this love of mine
Wildflower
Sacrifice everything in a wonderland that you know
If older is wise
One look in your eyes
I'm younger then I should be
And only time 
Waiting for you 
to grow
First say you love me and then say you'll leave me
But we never say goodbye
God you're an angel 
But only an angel must choose
Someone will hurt you and when you stop running
There's only this love of mine
