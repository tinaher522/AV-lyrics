<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="Search,_Find">
Don't let the day keep movin' on with tears and pride              
They hide the sun                                                     
Look to the road that lies ahead 
I'm turning to the dream we left to die
Dying alone, cry for the moment you passed me by
Baby I don't now how, I'm only crying now 
Search find 
No stone unturned, no hell, no fury gonna stop my love and all it's glory
Search find, no man, no god, no pain can sever my love for you
God, we're forever
Don't lose the will to make it right 
A day is just a brighter night
And from the flames, a dying love can learn to fly 
and rise above to be all that we are 
You are the heart of my ev'rything
Maybe I lose my mind, I'm not the losing kind
Search find 
No stone unturned, no hell, no fury gonna stop my love and all it's glory
Search find, no man, no god, no pain can sever my love for you 
God, we're forever
Search find 
No stone unturned, no hell, no fury gonna stop my love and all it's glory
Search find
No man, no god, no pain can sever my love for you
God, we're forever
Search find 
No stone unturned, no hell, no fury gonna stop my love and all it's glory
Search find
No man, no god, no pain can sever my love for you
God, we're forever
Search find 
No stone unturned, no hell, no fury gonna stop my love and all it's glory
Search find
No man, no god, no pain can sever my love for you
God, we're forever
