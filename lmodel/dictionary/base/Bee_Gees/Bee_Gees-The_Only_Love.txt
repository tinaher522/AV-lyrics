<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="The_Only_Love">
I can relate
The story of my life
No brighter hope
No stronger emotion
I believed I could die over you
How you could ever
Break down and never see me through
Through my darkest night
And as I lie awake
One prayer within me burning
And there's no price on what you hold
Till it's gone
And it keeps moving on
Where is my heart
You know I will be waiting to be
A part of you
You'll never feel the pain
How can you say to me
That I should go on living
I left the only life I had with you
The only love
No use in me pretending to be
A part of you
And you the heart of me
How can you say to me
That I should go on living
I left the only life I had with you
So we agree
To let each other go
No long goodbye
Just your way and my way
And I can stand how you cried to be free
High as the wind blows
But not enough to bring you home to me
And only lonely knows
You see my open arms
You know my flame is burning
But I'm too blind to see the end has begun
And it keeps movin' on
The only love
No use in me pretending to be
A part of you
And you the heart of me
How can you say to me
That I should go on living
I left the only life I had with you
The only love
One love that will not die
I may sorry that I built my
World around you
The only love
Is only you and I
There will be others who would
Leave you as I found you
The only love
One love that will not die
I may sorry that I built my
World around you
The only love
Is only you and I
There will be others who would
Leave you as I found you
