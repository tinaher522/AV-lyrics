<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="Nights_On_Broadway">
Here we are 
In a room full of strangers
Standing in the dark 
Where your eyes couldn't see me
Well, I had to follow you
Though you did not want me to
But that won't stop my lovin' you
I can't stay away
Blaming it all
On the nights on Broadway
Singing them love songs
Singing them straight-to-the-heart songs
Blaming it all 
On the nights on Broadway
Singing them sweet sounds
To that crazy, crazy town
Now in my place
There are so many others
Standing in the line
How long will they stand between us
Well, I had to follow you
Though you did not want me to
That won't stop my lovin' you
I can't stay away
Blaming it all (Blame it all)
On the nights on Broadway (Blame it on the nights on Broadway)
Singing them love songs
Singing them straight-to-my-heart songs
Blaming it all (I blame it all)
On the nights on Broadway (Blame it on the nights on Broadway)
Singing them sweet sounds
To that crazy, crazy town (Oh, those nights)
I will wait
Even if it takes forever
I will wait
Even if it takes a lifetime
Somehow I feel inside
You never, ever left my side
Make it like it was before
Even if it takes a lifetime
Takes a lifetime
Blaming it all (Blame it all)
On the nights on Broadway (Blame it on the nights on Broadway)
Singing them love songs (Yeah)
Singing them straight-to-my-heart songs (Yeah, blame it all)
Blaming it all (I blame it all)
On the nights on Broadway (Blame it on the nights on Broadway)
Singing them sweet sounds (Oh, yeah)
To that crazy, crazy town (Yeah)
Blaming it all (I blame it all)
On the nights on Broadway (Blame it on the nights on Broadway)
Singing them love songs (Uh-huh)
Singing them straight-to-my-heart songs (Yeah)
Blaming it all (I blame it all)
On the nights on Broadway (Ooh, blame it on the nights on Broadway)
Singing them sweet sounds (Oh, yeah, yeah)
To that crazy, crazy town (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Blaming it all (I blame it all)
On the nights on Broadway (Ooh, blame it on the nights on Broadway)
Singing them love songs (Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Singing them straight-to-my-heart songs (Oh, yeah)
Blaming it all (I blame it all)
On the nights on Broadway (Yeah, yeah)
Singing them sweet sounds (Oh)
To that crazy, crazy town
