<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="Take_Hold_Of_That_Star">
Take hold of that star I give to you 
And tell me that you love me 
Just as I love you. 
Take hold of that star and put it in your locket 
And tell me that you love me 
Just as I love you. 
I'd give you the moon or the sun 
Or the starlights with a love so true, 
and if it rains, I'll give you a rainbow too. 
Take hold of that star and put it in your locket 
And tell me that you love me 
Just as I love you. 
I'd give you the moon or the sun 
Or the starlights with a love so true. 
And if it rains, I'll give you a rainbow too. 
Take hold of that star and put it in your locket 
And tell me that you love me 
Just as I love you. 
La la la... as I love you.
