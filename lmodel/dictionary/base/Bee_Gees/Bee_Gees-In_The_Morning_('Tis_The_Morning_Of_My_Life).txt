<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="In_The_Morning_('Tis_The_Morning_Of_My_Life)">
In the morning when the moon is at its rest,
you will see me at the time I love the best,
watching rainbows, play on sunlight,
pools of water iced from cold night,in the morning.
'Tis the morning of my life.
In the daytime I will meet you as before.
You will find me waiting by the ocean floor,
building castles in the shifting sands
in a world that no one understands,
in the morning.
'Tis the morning of my life.
In the morning of my life
the minutes take so long to drift away.
Please be patient with your life,
it's only morning and you're still to live your day.
In the evening I will fly you to the moon,
to the top right hand corner of the ceiling in my room,
where we'll stay until the sun shines,
another day to swing on clothe's lines,
may I be yawning.
It is the morning of my life.
It is the morning of my life.
In the morning, In the morning, In the morning.
