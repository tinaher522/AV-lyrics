<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="The_Singer_Sang_His_Song">
He'd sing his song most every night 
Wishing she was there behind the light 
The people danced and sang along
On the cardboard stage he never sang it wrong
And the piper played the tune
And the drummer wore his spurs
But the song that the singer sang was for her
Now the singer's song is never heard
And the visions he once saw are disappeared 
Now they never dance or sing along
But on the cardboard stage he never sang it wrong 
And the piper played the tune
And the drummer wore his spurs
But the song that the singer sang was for her
Ahaha...
