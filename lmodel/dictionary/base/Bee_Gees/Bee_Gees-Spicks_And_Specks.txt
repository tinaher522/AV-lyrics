<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="Spicks_And_Specks">
Where is the sun
That shone
On my head?
The sun in my life
It is dead
It is dead
Where is the lights
That would play
In my street?
And where are the friends
I could meet
I could meet?
Where are the girls
That I
Left far behind
The spicks and the specks
Of the girls
On my mind
Where is the sun
That shone
On my head?
The sun in my life
It is dead
It is dead
Ah, where are the girls
That I
Left far behind?
The spicks and the specks
Of the girls
On my mind
Where are the girls
I left
Far behind?
The spicks and the specks
Of the girls
On my mind
Where is the girl
I loved
All along?
The girl that I loved
She is gone
She is gone
All of my life
I call
Yesterday
The spicks and the specks
Of my life
Gone away
All of my life
I call
Yesterday
The spicks and the specks
Of my life
Gone away
Everybody!
Spicks and Specks
Spicks and Specks, oh
Spicks and Specks
Spicks and Specks
