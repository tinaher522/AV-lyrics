<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="The_Woman_In_You">
The woman in you brings out
the man in me
It's the woman in you
And the finer parts of your anatomy
But baby sharper than a knife
help me to know you
Show me the night to satisfy
A sinner with the flash of an eye
There'll never be another me
I never knew love could wind me up
I don't do my stuff
"till you go walkin' by
And maybe old enough to try
I never knew anyone in between
The devil and the angel
All in one and maybe old
Enough that I can ride
Your love let me burn
Let me slide down to your soul
You can pull me in
You can push me out
But your baby needs love
Somebody to hold
show me what to do
The woman in you brings out
the man in me
It's the woman in you
And the finer parts of your anatomy
But baby, stronger than the wind burn
In the fire out of the night
I'll teach you how to tremble
If you give me the night
THere'll never be enough to me
I never knew I could find the best
But searchin' out the rest there
Is no doubt and maybe we can
sweat it out
I never knew we could find
A way this crazy situation
Over me and we forget about
the world outside
My love in your eyes
There's no world
There is no time
You can hold me in
You can throw me down
But your baby needs love
Somebody to hold
show me what to do
The woman in you brings out
the man in me
It's the woman in you
And the finer parts of your anatomy
