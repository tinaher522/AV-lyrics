<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="Crazy_For_Your_Love">
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Never get enough I'm crazy for your love
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Never get enough I'm crazy
Ice cream, couldn't taste any better
Your bad reputation
A mission that you keep to the letter
A state of love, can drive us all insane
Why a man can stand for so much pain
But I stand
You know the time is right
I feel my knees start shaking
And I can't stop running
You don't know but the word is out
I go crazy for your love
I breakdown to the ground, and I gotta shout
I go crazy for your love
I go crazy when you touch me, and I'm over the top
Don't wanna fight it and I'm giving up
Lips all ready to burn
Don't need a doctor
Nobody can save me
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Never get enough I'm crazy for your love
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Never get enough I'm crazy
I know, I know
I know, oh, oh, oh, oh
I can't sleep, can't sleep
I turn the television on
It's your face that I see on the screen
Replacing all the other ones
I'm so blind, that every girl I see
Reminds me that I need to be
In your arms
The place is here and now
The brain is past controlling and
The soul is crying
You don't know but the word is out
I go crazy for your love
I breakdown to the ground, and I gotta shout
I go crazy for your love
I go crazy for your fingers up and down my spine
Come a little closer baby, you will find
Lips all ready to burn
Don't need a doctor when I'm almost dying
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Never get enough I'm crazy for your love
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Never get enough I'm crazy
Lips all ready to burn
Don't need a doctor, when I'm almost dying
Gotta keep trying
You don't know but you're number 1
I go crazy for your love
You give me feelings that I
Couldn't get from anyone
I go crazy for your love...
