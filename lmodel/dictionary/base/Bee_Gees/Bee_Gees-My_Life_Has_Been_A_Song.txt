<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="My_Life_Has_Been_A_Song">
Sweet simple song of diff'rent lights and diff'rent shades
The sound of life erupts and fades and all the world must play along
My life has been a song
Here as I sleep, the love I dream will gently creep
Inside my heart I softly keep the tune that plays too long
My life has been a song
Ev'ry sound in my head, ev'ry word that I said is like a melody melody
That no little person like me could ever change 
Ev'ry sound in the street , all the cold and the heat 
is like a symphony symphony
Which has never before been rearranged
Sweet simple song of diff'rent lights and diff'rent shades
The sound of life erupts and fades and all the world must play along 
My life has been a song
Ev'ry sound in my head , ev'ry word that I said is like a melody melody
That no little person like me could ever change
Ev'ry sound in the street , all the cold and the heat
is like a symphony symphony
Which has never before been rearranged
Sweet simple song of diff'rent lights and diff'rent shades
The sound of life erupts and fades and all the world must play along 
My life has been a song
Ev'ry sound in my head , ev'ry word that I said is like a melody melody 
That no little person like me could ever change
Ev'ry sound in the street , all the cold and the heat
is like a symphony symphony
Which has never before been rearranged
