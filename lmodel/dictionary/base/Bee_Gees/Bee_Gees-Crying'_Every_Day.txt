<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="Crying'_Every_Day">
I wasn't born to be alone that was a lesson I was shown
To know that love was just a lie
I ran away to think it over
But it's over and I try to take a stand on what is real
Someone has shown me how to feel
I'm like a shadow in the night
I'm like a river in an ocean
I'm a flame without a light
And now I'm cryin' ev'ry day
And I've been cryin' ev'ry day
And I been think' of your love
I keep turnin' I keep turnin'
I keep turnin' I keep turnin'
Well your love is a cathedral and I came down here to pray
And now I'm cryin' ev'ry day
Can there be any wonder why to be living under
Love is a revelation only few can share
I could be a mountain strong but the pain about you
Long as I live without you
I would still be there
I wanna die, die away
Never love,never cry
And I been walkin' in the rain
And I been hangin' on a dream
All the faces and the places that our love has ever been
Now I'm cryin' ev'ry day
And I been cryin' ev'ry day
And I been thinkin' of your love
I keep turnin' , I keep turnin'
I keep turning', I keep turnin'
Well your love is a cathedral and I came down here to pray
And now I'm cryin' ev'ry day
Can there be any wonder why to be living under
Love is a revelation only few can share
I could be a mountain strong but the pain about you
Long as I live without you I would still be there
I wanna die, die away
Never love, never cry
I wasn't born to be a fool but I'm a fool to be around
I'm a man without a country I'm a King without a crown
And then you're throwin' me away
Another world , another time
But if anyone belongs to anybody you were mine
And I'm cryin' ev'ry day
And I been cryin' ev'ry day
And I've been thinkin' of your love
I keep turnin' I keep turnin'
I keep turnin' I keep turning'
Well your love is a cathedral and I came down here to pray
And now I'm
