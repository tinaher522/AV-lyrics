<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="Wouldn't_I_Be_Someone">
Maybe there's a reason why we broke up
I could dedicate my life to something new
But I must have been asleep but then I woke up
Working out why I was still with you
All the things I wish I could have been 
Wouldn't I be someone , someone
And I would be respected 
In the prime of my life , I'll do ev'rything right 
I'll begin 
Wouldn't I be something , something
I would get a reputation
In the prime of my life , I'll do ev'rything right 
I'll begin 
Midnight stars are shining on my shoeshine
Telling me the things I'm gonna be
Now the hurts all gone , I've pushed them all behind me
And the world is gonna fall in love with me 
All the things I wish I could have been 
Wouldn't I be someone , someone
And I would be respected
In the prime of my life, I'll do ev'rything right 
I'll begin 
Wouldn't I be something, something
I would get a reputation
In the prime of my life , I'll do ev'rything right 
I'll begin
