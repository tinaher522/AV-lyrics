<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="Close_Another_Door">
Many years have passed, it seems,
And now I'm all alone.
I've sent the children far away
To some obscure unknown.
It's so sad,
So sad.
Close another door.
Listen to my eyes.
Close another door.
You're much too old to work,
So won't you run away?
When I was young, I used to say
That age won't bother me.
The life I had was very sad,
It all went out to sea
It's so sad,
So so sad.
Close another door.
Listen to my eyes.
Close another door.
You're much too old to work,
So won't you run away?
Though the sun is in outside,
The rain is in my hair.
Now all my life is lived inside,
My home is in my chair.
It's so sad,
So so sad.
Close another door.
Listen to my eyes.
Close another door.
You're much too old to work,
So won't you run away?
Let me go.
Send me flowers and
Put me on a plane.
I've paid before,
So I've been told
At least I'm alive
