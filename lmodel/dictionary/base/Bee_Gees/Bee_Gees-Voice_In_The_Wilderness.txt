<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="Voice_In_The_Wilderness">
It's another woman
Hey, it could be me, it could be anyone
Yeah, she got the energy to blind the sun
And she make me glow
She sparkle and I see the light
I miss her every moment she is out of sight
She's a necessity
My baby keeps rolling me
Watch her glide
This girl is bonafide
She's got what causes chaos
She's got the power that I can't explain
Blowing through each other like a hurricane
Look at me, I'm twenty-seven stories high
There may be somebody else and,
I don't want to live like that
No, I don't want to live like that
Don't want to live like that
No, I don't want to live like that, live like that
Just another voice in the wilderness
Stick with me forever
Cross my heart and hope to die
You should give me everything and so will I
And the world will know
I say I will not lie
You know more lovers than one for some become a necessity
My baby keeps rolling me
Live on stage
Exposing my jealous rage
Life can be complicated
I give you something you can talk about
Love is like a prison and you can't get out
These things are hard to find
You say the world is flat but
I don't want to live like that
No, I don't want to live like that
Don't want to live like that
No, I don't want to live like that, live like that
Just another voice in the wilderness
Walking through the fire
Running like a river 'til the race is won
I'm risking everything to be someone
I will stick by you
We know but we will not fail
Lifting of the spirit and the flesh prevails
And the fight is on
This love, it keeps rolling on
Watch me fly
Into the clear blue sky
This is the age of wonder
I am the one
I don't want to live like that
No, I don't want to live like that
I don't want to live like that, live like that
Just another voice in the wilderness
