Na na na na na na na na na
Paper mache and telegraph poles
Things go dead in the night
Make enough noise to make enough noise
To make you want to jump with fright
Elephant's tusks and autograph books ,people you don't meet
Haven't got a bed to lay my head , shoes to fit my feet
Don't be scared
You're better off then nothing
You're answering to no one
Paper mache
Paper mache and telegraph poles
Thing go dead in the night
Make enough noise to make enough noise
To make you want to jump with fright
Elephant's tusks and autograph books, people you don't meet
Haven't got a bed to lay my head, shoes to fit my feet
Don't be scared
You're better off then nothing
You're answering to no one
Paper mache
All of a sudden it happened
When you did what you said you'd do
And you broke my heart in two
Like paper mache
All of a sudden it happened, oh...
You came into my life
Like paper mache you broke my heart
Like paper mache, paper mache
Like paper mache
Paper mache and telegraph poles
Things go dead in the night
Make enough noise to make enough noise
To make you wanna jump with fright
Elephant's tusks and autograph books
People you don't meet
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la
Jimmy had a bomb and the bomb went bang
Jimmy was everywhere
Jimmy had a bomb and the bomb went bang
Jimmy was everywhere
Jimmy had a bomb and the bomb went bang
Jimmy was everywhere
