<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="Wing_And_A_Prayer">
Lovers in ancient times
Now it begins -- I see it in your eyes
And I know how you feel -- you long to touch the sky
The flame of life, let it eat your heart out every night
But you're not alone
This is your world -- this is your world
Lovers in ancient time, caught in the fire
Only the strong survive -- how can we face tomorrow
Live an illusion, don't let it fade and die
Something deep inside you, a wing and a prayer will guide you
Something deep inside you
Something deep inside you, a wing and a prayer will guide you
Something deep inside you
Spoken:
Go now, girl, don't look back. this is your one big chance.
I place my fingers to your lips and I tell you my love flies with you
On a wing and a prayer, on a wing and a prayer
No muscle and bone -- rhythm is the key
There's everything to play for -- you're everything to me
The game of life -- win it and your love comes tumbling down
You'll never be alone
This is your world -- this is your world
This is your world -- this is your world
Lovers in ancient time, caught in the fire
Only the strong survive -- how can we face tomorrow
Live an illusion, don't let it fade and die
Something deep inside you, a wing and a prayer will guide you
Something deep inside you
Something deep inside you, a wing and a prayer will guide you
Something deep inside you
Something deep inside you, a wing and a prayer will guide you
Something deep inside you
