<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="Such_A_Shame">
All that I hear doesn't feel right.
Don't call me till you're all right.
I listened and I heard but don't tell me. La de da.
Once in a while he says good night.
Will I care if sometimes he is right?
What a shame, it's the same each day. La de da...
Oh how I tried!
I just sat and then I cried.
Maybe I'm wrong or will I find out when I'm gone?
Have so much fun in my leisure.
Don't bother me, man, just stay there.
If it's a sin, I'll convert me astray. La de da...
Come be home with me, it's not a shame for you to see
Oh let it be and you'll miss reality.
