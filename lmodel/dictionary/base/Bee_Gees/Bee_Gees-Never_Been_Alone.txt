<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="Never_Been_Alone">
I've never been alone and I've only seen the sky
Still I know the reason why
I've been thinking it over
I've never climbed a tree but that's natural for me
And you don't know my name so I'm thinking it over
And ev'ry day I'm learning the things that are concerning you and I
And if you were beside me you'd know what's inside me so tell me why
Give me inspiration to clear the situation we've known too long
And if we end up crying then one of us is lying so tell me
Never rode a plane and I never will again 
So 'til then I'll drink the rain while I'm thinking it over
And ev'ry day I'm learning the things that are concerning you and I
And if you were beside me you'd know what's inside me so tell me why
Give me inspiration to clear the situation we've known too long
And if we end up crying then one of us is lying so tell me 
Never rode a plane and I never will again 
So 'til then I'll drink the rain while I'm thinking it over
Yes I'm thinking it over
