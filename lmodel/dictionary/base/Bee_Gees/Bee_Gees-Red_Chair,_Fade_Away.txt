<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="Red_Chair,_Fade_Away">
Red chair fade away 
Bring back memories 
Think of something nice 
Fragrant lemon trees 
I can feel the speaking sky 
I don't want to know 
It's filling up the air 
Grandpa's fairy tales
Red chair round the fire 
Rainbows all the time 
We're all going higher 
I can feel the speaking sky 
I don't want to know 
It's filling up the air 
Red chair fade away 
Red chair fade away 
Red chair fade away 
Red chair fade away 
Red chair fade away 
Bring back memories 
Think of something nice 
Fragrant lemon trees 
I can feel the speaking sky 
I don't want to know 
It's filling up the air 
Red chair fade away...
Red chair fade away...
