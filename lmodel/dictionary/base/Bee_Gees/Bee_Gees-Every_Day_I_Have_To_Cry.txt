<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="Every_Day_I_Have_To_Cry">
There was a little girl I planned to marry,
If this was my love I didn't want to share.
I thought that love would make my life bright and sunny,
But she said she could not love me 'cause I didn't have no money.
Every day I have to cry so,
Drying the water from my eyes so,
Till the clouds slowly pass by (?)
Every day I have to cry.
I got me a girl,
I guess I really love her,
'cause every night I've been thinking over.
But you can't live all your love this morning,
But if you do it's gonna hurt somebody.
Every day I have to cry so,
Drying the water from my eyes so,
Till the clouds slowly pass by (?)
Every day I have to cry.
I thought I know she's just a woggle (?)
If she found a love because she's not a rich girl (?)
But every time you reach love this morning (?)
Every time it's gonna hurt somebody.
Every day I have to cry so,
Drying the water from my eyes so,
Till the clouds slowly pass by (?)
Every day I have to cry.
