<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="The_Greatest_Man_In_The_World">
Before I heard your voice I never heard a sound like that before
I wanna hear it more and more 
Take me to heaven
My love is stronger than the wall
I'll climb it till I fell so I can hear you call your love
I'd be the greatest man in the world
'cause I can say I got the greatest girl
I'd be the greatest man in the world
'cause I can say I got the greatest girl
Before I saw your face I never say a dream like that before
I wanna see it more and more
Take me to heaven
My love is stronger than the wall
I'll climb it till I fall so I can hear you call your love
Be the greatest man in the world
'cause I can say I've got the greatest girl
Be the greatest man in the world
'cause I can say I got the greatest girl, the greatest girl
Be the greatest man in the world
Be the greatest man in the world
