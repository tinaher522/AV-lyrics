<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="You_Know_It's_For_You">
I would die for you.
I have cried for you ,believe me girl.
Don't you think it's time you made up your own mind?
All my love's for you.
All I do's for you.
Still I think it's time you made up your own mind.
A melody, my symphony
You know it's for you, love.
It's plain to see, it's meant to be.
Now it's up to you, love.
Still I'll wait for you.
Waiting just for you, don't leave me girl.
Don't you think it's time you made up your own mind?
Love is here for you.
Love was made for you, believe me girl. 
Don't you think it's time you gave up?
You are mine. 
La da da la dee da dee da-ee-a-ee-a-ee-a-ee-ah
La da da la dee da dee da-ee-a-ee-a-ee-a-ee-ah
Doo doo doo doo doo doo, you know it's for you
Doo doo doo doo doo doo, you know it's for you
Doo doo doo doo doo doo, you know it's for you
Doo doo doo doo doo doo, you know it's for you
Doo doo doo doo doo doo, you know it's for you
