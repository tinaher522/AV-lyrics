<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="When_Do_I">
Tell me if dreams do come true.
If so then I know that I'm losing you.
And you know the address where we live.
But I swear there'll be no turning back to you 
I won't forgive.
When do I and when do I know if there's an answer why.
I wonder if I know where I fit in .
How do I and how do I stop myself from gonna cry.
I wonder if I know where I fit in 
Tell me if dreams do come true.
If so then I know that I'm losing you.
And you know the address where we live.
But I swear there'll be no turning back to you
I won't forgive.
When do I and when do I know if there's an answer why.
I wonder if I know where I fit in .
And how do I and how do I stop myself from gonna cry
I wonder if I know where I fit in .
And when do I and when do I , when do I 
When do I know if I fit in
