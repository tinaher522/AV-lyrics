<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="In_My_Own_Time">
I received an invitation; 
'Come to the United Nations.' 
That was when I was somebody. 
In my own time. 
Sitting selling hot cross buns, 
Thousand suckers ev'ryone. 
Sounds just like a nurs'ry rhyme. 
In my own time. 
Even when the lights go out. 
Still got things to think about. 
Memories I can't call mine. 
In my own time. 
My own time. 
My own time.
