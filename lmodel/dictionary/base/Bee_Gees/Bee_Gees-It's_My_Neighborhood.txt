<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="It's_My_Neighborhood">
Don't get too close to me,
Don't overreact,
You're not the enemy as a matter of fact,
You got your pretty face and you got any name you wore
Gonna stick by you, gonna stumble over what to do.
I want it, good lovin' wanna be your plaything.
I want it, good lovin' bring out the beast in me.
I want it, good lovin' wanna make your heart sing,
In the shadows we are free, and I walk you through it.
It's my neighborhood, 
That's where I belong.
You're in trouble if you
Disagree with me.
It's my neighborhood,
That's where I belong,
You find out why.
It's my neighborhood, 
That's where I belong.
You're in trouble if you
Disagree with me.
It's my neighborhood,
That's where I belong,
You find out why.
So many tell you that you can't win
It's a battle if you're lonely
Or if you're starting over
Two-fisted and fast on your feet
And you know there's something more
And the city kicks it out of you and...
I want it, good lovin' wanna be your plaything.
I want it, good lovin' bring out the worst in me.
I want it, good lovin' wanna make your heart sing,
In the shadows we are free, and I walk you through it.
It's my neighborhood, 
That's where I belong.
You're in trouble if you
Disagree with me.
It's my neighborhood,
That's where I belong,
You find out why.
