<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="Daydream">
What a day for a daydream
What a day for a daydreaming boy
And now I'm lost in a daydream
Dreaming 'bout my bundle of joy
And even if time ain't really on my side 
It's one of those days for takin' a walk outside 
I'm blowing the day to take a walk in the sun
And fall on my face on somebody's new mowed lawn 
I've been having a sweet dream
Been dreaming since I woke up today
It's starring me and my sweet dream
'Cause she's the one makes me feel this way
And even if time is passing me by a lot
I couldn't care less about these blues you say I've got
Tomorrow I'll pay the dues for dropping so low
A pie in the face for being a sleepy beau deau
And you can be sure that if you're feeling right
A daydream'll last along into the night
Tomorrow at breakfast you may perk up your ears
Or you may be daydreaming for a thousand years
What a day for a daydream
Custom made for a daydreaming boy
And now I'm lost in a daydream
Dreaming 'bout my bundle of joy
