<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="Party_With_No_Name">
Let's get started
Move in for the kill
So sincere
I'm here to bend your will
A man without a face
I give you love you've never known
We can hold each other, sight unseen
Touchin' on our darkest dream
You can wish for something bad
Lovers' lips you never had
All she wants is your love
All she wants is your love
We're the party with no name
And we go from flame to flame
We've got one claim to fame
We're the party with no name
Make those footsteps to the floor
You can't see us anymore
Ain't no time for the shame
For the party with no name
Easy money
Get yourself a job
It's my invitation
Been alone too long
A soul without a space
A party with no mane
Truth is there, but she don't see
Her life is just a mystery
I'd give her more than I could give
I'd even die that she could live
All she wants is your love
All she wants is your love
We're the party with no name
And we go from flame to flame
We've got one claim to fame
We're the party with no name
All she wants is your love
All she wants is your love
We're the party with no name
And we go from flame to flame
We've got one claim to fame
We're the party with no name
