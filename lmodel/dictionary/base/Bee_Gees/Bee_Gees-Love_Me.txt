<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="Love_Me">
I remember times my love when we really had it all 
You were always there to make me smile, help me when I fall 
Ooh, I can't believe you're leaving me 
When there's so much more to say -- I can't let you go 
Ooh , ev'ry time I look at you I still can feel the glow 
Let it be, let it grow 
Love me , please , just a little bit longer 
Together we can make it 
Our love is much too young to break it 
Love me , please , just a little bit harder 
All I ever wanted was to have you to myself 
Then I see you standing there in the arms of someone else 
You know a man can stand so much 
And it's more then I can bear -- I can't let you go 
Ooh, ev'ry time I look at you I still can feel the glow 
Let it be , let it grow 
Love me , please, just a little bit longer 
Together we can make it 
Our love is much too young to break it 
Love me , please, just a little bit harder 
Never even try to see things her way 
It's hard on a woman when love ain't no love at all 
And when she walks away (no no) -- and she probably will 
You're gonna be sorry, begging her , please 
Love me , please, just a little bit longer 
Together we can make it 
Our love is much too young to break it 
Love me , please, just a little bit harder 
I think I can work it out 
I can't get enough 
I want you tomorrow 
Love me , please, just a little bit longer 
Together we can make it 
Our love is much too young to break it 
Love me , please, just a little bit longer 
Together we can make it 
Our love is much too young to break it
