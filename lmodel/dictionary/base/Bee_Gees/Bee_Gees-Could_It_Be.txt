<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="Could_It_Be">
Look at me, 
I don't know what I'm doing 
ever since I looked at you. 
How did I get this crazy feeling? 
Could it be I'm in love with you? 
Ever since I saw you in the moonlight 
I've had this feeling through and through, 
since that time, I haven't done a thing right. 
Could it be I'm in love with you? 
Oh golly gee, 
I don't know where I'm going, 
I'm trying to make you see, 
oh boy, I got to make her fall in love with me. 
Oh, night after night, I'm always dreaming, 
why don't you make those dreams come true? 
Can't you see how much I really love you? 
Why don't you learn to love me too? 
Oh golly gee, 
I don't know where I'm going, 
I'm trying to make you see, 
oh boy, I got to make her fall in love with me. 
Oh, night after night, I'm always dreaming, 
why don't you make those dreams come true? 
Can't you see how much I really love you? 
Why don't you learn to love me too? 
Love me too, 
love me too.
