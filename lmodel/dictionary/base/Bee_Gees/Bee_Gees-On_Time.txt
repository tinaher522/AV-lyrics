<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="On_Time">
I ain't got time, only got a dime to make a last call 
I'm gettin' soaking wet and it ain't rained yet since last fall
I got myself a coach ticket on the Southern railroad line
I don't have to worry 'cause I know it never leaves on time
Late last night we made love and ev'rything was all right
You walked out the door and the only thing I saw was the hall light
I got myself a coach ticket on the Southern railroad line
I don't have to worry 'cause I know it never leaves on time 
Why didn't you see that you don't feel the same way as I do 
I understood before that you couldn't take much more as I knew
I got myself a coach ticket on the Southern railroad line
I don't have to worry 'cause I know it never leaves on time
