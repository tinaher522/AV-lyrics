<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="Living_Eyes">
Would you believe me if I told you your tomorrow is my yesterday
But be alive
I know that we will
The world keeps on moving but I'm holdin' still
In the beginning I was far away and praying for my destiny
That would arrive
The moment you're born
For we will be here when the miracle comes
Living Eyes,when under the sun don't cry
No war in my mind
The state of my heart
Living eyes, when out in the rain will fall
The day I deny the face of my love
We are of age, we are in time
We are forever
Right now when the power is mine
I leave you heaven and the earth
I leave you never
And living to love is the reason we shine
When I been over I been under 
I don't own a dream to analyze
But living eyes you know that I do
believe in the soul and the magic of you
Living eyes, when under the sun don't cry
No war in my mind
The state of my heart
Living eyes, when out in the rain will fall
The day I deny the face of my love
We are of age,we are in time
We are forever
Right now when the power is mine
I leave you heaven and the earth 
I leave you never
And living to love is the reason we shine
Living eyes
When under the sun don't cry
No war in my mind
The state of my heart
Living
