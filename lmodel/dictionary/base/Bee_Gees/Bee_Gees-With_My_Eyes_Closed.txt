<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="With_My_Eyes_Closed">
Say you never send me away
Makin' me a memory and
Tellin' me to find me a life
Change, there's nothing changing
What cannot be changed
And you are witness to a silent conversation,
Nothin' but the black of night,
No-one ever takes your place
Gotta let the pantomime
Play
Not to worry, my telepathy
I bring you into me there's be no seperation
And I tell you
I will climb inside your world
And all my history
Must revolve around this girl
And I can see you with my eyes closed
I can feel you when you're near me
Just the knowing that you
Hear me, could be
You could measure my love
I can touch you with my hands tied
It don't take no extra feeling
Let your imagination, just run
You can measure my love
And they tell you
They can stop these tears you cry
And we can ride this storm together
And all the love that lasts forever
And forever, and forever
Cling to the vine and the vine never breaks
It's a message from a ship to store
For the soul and the sacrifice
Pain
There's no fury,
Like a woman scorned,
We could be victims of a lethal combination
It's the hourIt's the sword that hides the stone
And one of us holds the power
There to forge our hearts together
Here forever, and forever
