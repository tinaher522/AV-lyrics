<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="Top_Hat">
Life is just a bore
It's a drag to leave my door
Guess I'll have to say
I just cry my life away
I'll buy a top hat to brighten up my lonely life
And they can see that I've got the money for the things money brings
Put it on my head and each time I head to bed
Put it in a box near my dirty shoes an socks
I'll but a top hat to brighten up my lonely life
And they can see that I've got the money for the things money brings
I like that top hat
Do you? 
Yes
Would you like to buy that? 
Of course. how much is thatÂ ? 
3 pound 6 then please sir .
Thank you
I'll but a top hat to brighten up my lonely life
And they can see that I've got the money for the things money brings
And until she comes and she brings me happiness
This is what I want , nothing more, nothing less
