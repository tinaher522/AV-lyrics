<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="Obsessions">
It happened in the middle of the night
When I thought I had control
Didn't want to be the one to fight
Didn't want to lose my soul
I was up for something more
Never thought I'd get it started
Paralyzed, polarized
Hung on every word
I'm in love with the child inside
I don't have a right to follow you
Or have a license to get closer
A love that won't be denied
For you are something like I've never seen
I'm a man whose heart is crying
Just another one of my obsessions
You don't want to be a special toy
I never be the one to hurt you
Like every other girl and boy
Just another little indicretion
Another game that you want to try
You can never be unfaithful
If you gotta love somebody
Want to make your mountains high
Want to take your valley low
There's a moral to my story
Let me in a close the door
Until the morning light
What I'd give to live inside you
Make me wait, we separate
But only to return
Whisper and I'll be there
I don't want you begging me to stop
I just want to drown in your desire
Love is for those who dare
All the cream is rising to the top
And it's the love you save from dying
Just another one of my obsessions
You don't want to be a special toy
I never be the one to hurt you
Like every other girl and boy
Just another little indicretion
Another game that you want to try
You can never be unfaithful
If you gotta love somebody
Just another one of my obsessions
Something I could never find
It's the kind of love that makes your heart
Feel obsessed with mine
Any battle for the one possession
Another game that you want to try
You can never be unfaithful
If you gotta love somebody
Just another one of my obsessions
You don't want to be a special toy
I never be the one to hurt you
Like every other girl and boy
Just another little indicretion
Another game that you want to try
You can never be unfaithful
If you gotta love somebody
Just another one of my obsessions
Something I could never find
It's the kind of love that makes your heart
Feel obsessed with mine
Any battle for the one possession
Another game that you want to try
You can never be unfaithful
If you gotta love somebody
Just another one of my obsessions
You don't want to be a special toy
I never be the one to hurt you
Like every other girl and boy
Just another little indicretion
Another game that you want to try
You can never be unfaithful
If you gotta love somebody
