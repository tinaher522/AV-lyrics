<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="Charade">
Some nights we made our love in the sand
And at the dark we held our love hand in hand
And we listened to music the ocean was playing
The words that our two hearts were saying
That only two lovers can make
Let us ride on the wind while this moment is real
Your the light of my life
You are welcome to my Charade
And this feeling knowing you blessed me forever
And believing I have been touch by your love 
And the pleasure of knowing the evening won't tare us apart
We can follow the sun to the day light is gone
We can gaze up the sky till the night is over
Light of my life 
You are welcome to my Charade
And this feeling knowing you blessed me forever
We can follow the sun to the day light is gone
We can gaze at the sky till the night is over
Light of my life
You are welcome to my Charade
And this feeling knowing you blassed me forever
We can follow the sun to the day light is gone
We can gaze at the sky till the night is over
Light of my life
You are welcome to my Charade
