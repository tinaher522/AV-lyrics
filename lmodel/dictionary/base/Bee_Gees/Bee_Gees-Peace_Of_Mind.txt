<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="Peace_Of_Mind">
Ah...
Some may find peace of mind loving a girl like you 
But I can say, in your way, you only make me blue. 
Some may say you don't play, you have a heart that's true 
But how can they believe what you say, you only make me blue. 
You hurt me and you fool around. 
You don't even give me a chance. 
Well it's over and I'm telling you 
It's the end of our romance. 
Some may find peace of mind loving a girl like you 
But I can say, in your way, you only make me blue. 
Ah...
You hurt me and you fool around. 
You don't even give me a chance. 
Well it's over and I'm telling you 
It's the end of our romance. 
Some may find peace of mind loving a girl like you 
But I can say, in your way, you only make me blue. 
Ah...
