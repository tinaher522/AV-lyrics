<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="My_Thing">
I see my dog lying under the table
I see him licking my brother's girlfriend's hand
La de da da da
La de du da de du da  de du du
I can't understand those eyes that keep staring at me
I can't understand how you do what you do to me
I keep on looking for you everywhere
I can't get used to the feeling you're giving me
Bowzey wow wowzey
Bowzey wow wowzey bow wowzey bow wowzey
Du du du du
La la la la la la la la la
