<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="Happy_Ever_After">
Though I know it's time to take you home
Baby you and I are all alone
We should take a moment of our own
And look what we've got
You could destroy this heart of mine
I'm only trying to get by
Hiding in the shadows of the night
Holding you and knowing the wrong is right
Show me some mercy
You know what you're doin' is making me
A happy man
I shield you from the rain
I've been slow to get you but
I'm working
As hard as I can
This time, it's what we believe is true
And whether you believe I'm in love with you
I gotta be sure that you say what you mean
Is it only a dream to a teenage queen
And all the years of tears and laughter
We could go through
Will it be happy ever after
For me and you
Heaven is a place inside of me
Livin' with your heart as company
Only you can change the way I feel
And make it feel good
Where there is love there is no crime
I'm only tryin' to get mine
Let me be the one to dry your eyes
We can be the promise that never dies
Light of an angel
Blinded by the vision
I'm wishin' we could travel on
Stay with me baby
Any less than an hour
You be leavin' me lonely too long
This time, it's what we believe is true
And whether you believe I'm in love with you
I gotta be sure that you say what you mean
Is it only a dream to a teenage queen
And all the years of tears and laughter
We could go through
Will it be happy ever after
For me and you
This time, it's what we believe is true
And whether you believe I'm in love with you
I gotta be sure that you say what you mean
Is it only a dream to a teenage queen
And you define the dream you're after
Make it come true
Will it be happy ever after
Will it be happy ever after
For me and you
