<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="Kilburn_Towers">
I am a bird; watch me go drifting by.
With my feathers of power I laugh as the hours go slowly by.
That could mean ev'rything.
I am a street watching the people walk.
As I listen their conversations glisten as they start to talk.
Then I hear ev'rything.
Little white jug, me and Kilburn Towers,
As we sit on the hill and we drink and we swill
Till the early hours,
Then I am ev'rything.
Little white jug and me and Kilburn Towers  
That could mean ev'rything.
Little white jug, me and Kilburn Towers,
As we sit on the hill and we drink and we swill
Till the early hours,
Then I am ev'rything
Little white jug and me and Kilburn Towers
Little white jug and me and Kilburn Towers
Little white jug and me and Kilburn Towers
Little white jug and me and Kilburn Towers
