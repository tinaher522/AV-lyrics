<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="You_Should_Be_Dancing">
My baby moves at midnight
Goes right on 'til the dawn
My woman take me higher
My woman keep me warm
What you doin' on your back? Ahh
What you doin' on your back? Ahh
You should be dancing, yeah
Dancing, yeah
She's juicy and she's trouble
She gets it to me good
My woman give me power
Goes right down to my blood
What you doin' on your back? Ahh
What you doin' on your back? Ahh
You should be dancing, yeah
Dancing, yeah
What you doin' on your back? Ooh
What you doin' on your back? Ahh
You should be dancing, yeah
Dancing, yeah
Ba da, ba da, ba da, ba da, ba-ba da, ba da, ba da, ba da
Ba da, ba da, ba da, ba da, ba-ba da, ba da, ba da, ba da
Da da da, da
Da, da-da, da-da
Da, da-da, da-da
Da da da, da
Da, da-da, da-da
Da, da-da, da-da
My baby moves at midnight
Goes right on 'til the dawn, yeah
My woman take me higher
My woman keep me warm
What you doin' on your back? Ahh
What you doin' on your back? Ahh
You should be dancing, yeah
Dancing, yeah
What you doin' on your back? Ohh
What you doin' on your back? Ahh
You should be dancing, yeah
Dancing, yeah
You should be dancing, yeah
You should be dancing, yeah
You should be dancing, yeah
You should be dancing, yeah
You should be dancing, yeah
You should be dancing, yeah
You should be dancing, yeah
You should be dancing, yeah
You should be dancing, yeah
You should be dancing, yeah
You should be dancing, yeah
