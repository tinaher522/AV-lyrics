<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="Turning_Tide">
What would I say if you should turn away from me
I do not know if there are words that I can see
I only know that I am reaching too high
And who are we to touch the wind
And say our ship is coming in 
The turning tide
Tell me the answer in your changing mind, changing mind
I don't know if love can last
When time is gone and we are on the roundabout
Would you still laugh and be a clown when love runs out
Or will you say that I am reaching too high
And who are we to touch the wind 
And say our ship is coming in 
The turning tide
And who are we to touch the the wind 
And say our ship is coming in 
The turning tide
