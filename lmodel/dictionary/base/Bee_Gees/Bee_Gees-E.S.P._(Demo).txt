<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="E.S.P._(Demo)">
Somewhere, out across the nation
Someone, waiting in the shadows
Listen, I don't wanna hear
Return to, sender
Calling, I can see the future
Someday, signal with a single motion
Show me you believe in someone, love
You, you give, me
You give me the runaround
I'm the one you need to see,
I'm in your mind
And we got love
And love'll take you higher and higher and higher
E.S.P.
I communicate with you
Tell me what it means to feel
What am I supposed to do
E.S.P.
Nothing any words can say
Nothing that we know is real
It'll take you higher and higher and higher
Higher and higher 
Higher and higher

Danger, suddenly an early warning
Suddenly the soul is burning
But I still believe in someone, somewhere
(Well) baby you, give, me
You give me the runaround
Just another night with you
Your on my mind
And we got love
And love'll take you higher and higher and higher 
E.S.P.
I communicate with you 
Tell me what it means to feel
What am I supposed to do
E.S.P.
Nothing any words can say
Nothing that we know is real
And it'll take you higher and higher and higher
Higher and higher 
Higher and higher
Be prepared to make your sacrifice, babe
Far beyond the point of no return, oh no
You, give, me
You give me the runaround
Just another night with you
Your on my mind
And we got love
And love'll take you higher and higher and higher
Higher and higher 
Higher and higher
Higher and higher
E.S.P.
I communicate with you (I communicate)
Tell me what it means to feel (don't you, don't you)
What am I supposed to do
E.S.P.
Nothing any words can say (oh baby, nothing any words can)
Nothing that we know is real 
We can take your breath away
