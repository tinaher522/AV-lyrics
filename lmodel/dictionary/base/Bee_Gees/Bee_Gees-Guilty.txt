<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="Guilty">
Shadows falling , baby,
We stand alone
Out on the street anybody you meet 
Got a heartache of their own (It aught to be illegal)
Make it a crime to be lonely or sad (It aught to be illegal)
You got a reason for livin' 
You battle on with the love you're livin' on 
You gotta be mine
We take it away
It's gotta be night and day 
Just a matter of time
And we got nothing to be guilty of 
Our love will climb any mountain near or far , we are
And we never let it end 
We are devotion
And we got nothing to be sorry for 
Our love is one in a million 
Eyes can see that we got a highway to the sky
Don't wanna hear your goodbye
Pulses racing, darling
How grand we are
Little by little we meet in the middle 
There's danger in the dark (It aught to be illegal)
Make it a crime to be out in the cold (It aught to be illegal)
You got a reason for livin'
You battle on with the love you're buildin' on
You gotta be mine
We take it away
It's gotta be night and day 
Just a matter of time
And we got nothing to be guilty of
Our love will climb any mountain near or far, we are
And we never let it end 
We are devotion
And we got nothing to be sorry for 
Our love is one in a million 
Eyes can see that we got a highway to the sky
Don't wanna hear your goodbye
Don't wanna hear your 
And we got nothing to be guilty of
Our love will climb any mountain near or far, we are
And we never let it end 
We are devotion
And we got nothing to be sorry for 
Our love is one in a million
Eyes can see that we got a highway to the sky
Don't wanna hear your goodbye
Don't wanna hear your 
And we got nothing to be guilty of
