<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="Haunted_House">
I know baby's bad for my self-esteem
FInd another face for your sympathy
Some of us cry, some of them lie
But no one sees inside
The spark of baby's eyes and I turn to stone
Maybe I can't survive in the danger zone
Sounds of the night
Streets without light
And baby's not alone
Try to hold her to myself
Someone else is breaking all my dreams, she
Needs so many games to play
One more time I climb the stairs
Open up the door and she was gone
And baby here I go
Like a lamb to slaughter
Don't stop haunting me in this old house
I still love you when you're not around
I'm still waiting for your midnight ride
I'll still love you when it's cold outside
Me so sorry that I let you down
But you keep haunting me in this old town
Spoken:
And the smile is no longer there
The face and the eyes and the hair
Nothing stands the test of time
You live forever, never mine
I cling to dreams that turn to sand
Our life is now a distant land
We commit emotional suicide
Every single room is electrified
Your memory shadowing me
The house where sorrow hides
Pull it down, blow it up
Help me send these walls of love away
And baby here I go
Like a lamb to slaughter
Don't stop haunting me in this old house
I still love you when you're not around
I'm still waiting for your midnight ride
I'll still love you when it's cold outside
Me so sorry that I let you down
But you keep haunting me in this old town
