<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="True_Confessions">
I'm not the one in search of friction
I'm not the one to look for fights
When it gets down to me and you
I think it over twice
We sing the same song
With it all subject to change
There is another place in time, girl
You and I will meet again
I saw the signs I never knew
Didn't have enough on you to follow through
Call it innocent or guilty
Inside you, it's still me
Oooh, whose word you gonna take
Whose heart you gonna break
Not mine
If I believe your true confessions
I'm never gonna make it
You know you hurt me for the very last time
I need you darlin', and it tears me apart
And if someone comes between us
It's the death of my heart
I think about you and I paint a picture
You wanna love above the law
And you got a taste for adventure
It's what you're livin' for
We say the same lies
Anyone to crucify
We're the victims of the same sensations
I can be as bad as you
I step aside, you can understand
I won't stand in the way but I will if I can
Not to be your judge and jury
It's still you inside me
Oooh, whose word you gonna take
Whose heart you gonna break
Not mine
If I believe your true confessions
I'm never gonna make it
You know you hurt me for the very last time
I need you darlin', and it tears me apart
And if someone comes between us
It's the death of my heart
My gun is loaded and I'm ready for war
I come and get you and I kick down the door
There's no way, I can't let you leave
I'm not working for the enemy
Oooh, whose word you gonna take
Whose heart you gonna break
Not mine
If I believe your true confessions
I'm never gonna make it
You know you hurt me for the very last time
I need you darlin', and it tears me apart
And if someone comes between us
It's the death of my heart
