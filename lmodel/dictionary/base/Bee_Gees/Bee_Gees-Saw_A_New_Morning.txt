<song artist="Bee_Gees" title="Saw_A_New_Morning">
All of a sudden I saw a new morning
I'm locked up I want to be free
Out in the courtyard and over the wall then
My friends are waiting for me 
Sixteen people are waiting to get me
Hoping to take me outside
I hear the sound of the snubnose behind me
I went along for the ride
Wind in my face and my bones they are aching 
My soul must weather the storm
I must run till my back it is breaking
Desp'ratly I must keep on
Sixteen people are waiting to get me
Hoping to take me outside
I hear the sound of the snubnose behind me
I went along for the ride 
La...
All of a sudden I saw a new morning
I went along for the ride
All of a sudden I saw a new morning 
All of a sudden I saw a new morning 
All of a sudden I saw a new morning
I saw a new morning
I saw a new morning
I saw a new morning
I saw a new morning
