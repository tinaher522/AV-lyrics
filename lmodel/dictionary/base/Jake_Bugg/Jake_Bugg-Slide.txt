<song artist="Jake_Bugg" title="Slide">
I've been thinking about
The way the world turns
And my stomach churns
When it finally hits me out of the sky
I knew this day would come
I'm on the front line
Oh, don't know how to take it in
Is love just suffering?
Cause I can see where the chapter ends
I've got autumn leaves
And heartbreak dreams inside, inside
Cause you and me,
On this frozen sea we slide, slide
I wait all on my own
Like a flower in the snow
With just my shadow following me
Out into the cold
Where I walk past the trees
To look for my love
Oh, and it's got me wondering
Is love just suffering?
Cause I can see where the chapter ends
I've got autumn leaves
And heartbreak dreams inside, inside
Cause you and me,
On this frozen sea we slide, slide
Slide, slide
