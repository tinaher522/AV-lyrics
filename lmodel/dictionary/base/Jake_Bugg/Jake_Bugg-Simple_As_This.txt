<song artist="Jake_Bugg" title="Simple_As_This">
I've been in search of stones
Making up the pavement of less travelled roads
Mining for treasure deep in my bones
That I never found
Went looking for reverence
Tried to find it in a bottle
And came back again
High on a hashpipe of good intent
But it only brought me down
Tried institutions of the mind and soul
It only taught me what I should not know
Oh and the answer well who would have guessed
Could be something as simple as this
Something as simple as this
Travelled to each oceans end
Saw all seven wonders, trying to make some sense
Memorised the mantra Confucius said
But it only let me down
Tried absolution of the mind and soul
It only led me where I should not go
Oh and the answer well how could I miss
Something as simple as this?
Something as simple as this
I been falling crashing breaking
All the while you were stood here waiting
For me girl
Tried liberation of my own free will
But it left me looking to get higher still
Oh and the answer well who would have guessed
Could be something as simple as this?
God knows how I could of missed
Something as simple as this
