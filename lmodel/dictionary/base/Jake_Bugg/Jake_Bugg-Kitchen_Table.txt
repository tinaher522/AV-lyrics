<song artist="Jake_Bugg" title="Kitchen_Table">
I wrote this song by your kitchen table
Maybe it all seems okay
Sometimes it's better just to laugh
Than to run away
Maybe I'll leave you in the coming winter
And all of your dreams soon fade away
Sometimes it's better just to run
Than to play your game
When we were laying down and you held my hand
Amongst the opal flowers
When we sat outside and now I see it's over now
We just grew out of love
Out from the darkness
Your heartlessness haunting my future
Down on all fours
You bark bright at the descending moonlight
You'll be with the rest of the lonely people
Ones who live in a cold dark place
Sometimes it's better just to run
Than to face the pain
I've not been seeing you for some time now
And still you choose to hold my hate
But after how I handled it
You're hardly to blame
I feel you read my mind and look through my soul
As our love grew fainter and your face grew wetter
And I see it's over now
We just grew out of love
Out from the darkness
Your heartlessness haunting my future
Down on all fours
You bark bright at the descending moon
All of the rest of our days together
I may have never seemed the same
Sometimes there's nothing we can do
When we all change
And now my hearts in two, not a half for you
Another situation, now the morning's golden
And I see it's over now
We just grew out of love
Out from the darkness
Your heartlessness haunting my future
Down on all fours
You bark bright at the descending moonlight
