<song artist="Jake_Bugg" title="Hold_On_You">
Honey, I've been thinking 'bout you
I said, honey, I said I think 'bout you
'Cause lady, I said I don't think twice
I said lady, I said I don't think twice
No, you don't give me lovin' when I need it real bad
You got it all messed up from the home that you had
Lady, I got a hold on you
Cryin' lady, I got a hold on you
Honey, I said I don't look back
I said, honey, I said I don't look back
'Cause, lady, I said I don't think twice
I said, lady, I said I don't think twice
No, you don't give me lovin' when you get real mad
You got it all messed up from the moment you had me,
Lady, I said I got a hold on you
Cryin' lady, I got a hold on you
