<song artist="Jake_Bugg" title="Note_To_Self">
Girl, you've been forgetting
Just how special you really are
And I try to remind you
Sometimes I can't find you
But the truth is in your heart
So write a note to yourself
Girl, don't beat yourself up
Your best is good enough
So pick the pen up
So write a note to yourself,
A note to yourself
And don't be cruel,
'Cause things do happen
And you know it's not your fault
Don't cover your wounds with the salt
Girl, let me tell you what I see
You've got to believe me
You're a thing of beauty
Girl, put it in an envelope
Put it in the post
It'll come back to your door
So write a note to yourself,
A note to yourself
And don't be cruel,
'Cause things do happen
And you know it's not your fault
Don't cover your wounds with the salt
And write a note to yourself
And read the note to yourself
