<song artist="Jake_Bugg" title="Broken">
I'm waiting for you
For I'm broken down
Coming down this time
For my heart lies
Far and away where they took you down
Let them over to your house
Where I'm broken.
Down by the people if they let you breathe
Don't give a damn if you still can't see
Still my heart beats, for you
Have become, all I love,
And all I hoped for.
But I, must carry on
Always one
Never broken
Run to the lobby where I saw you try
Don't give a damn for your reasons why
Where Sophie's down in the valley where the church bells cry
I'll leave them over to your eyes.
Woah, I am one,
I am one.
Great story of
Peace and love,
In a future
Bright, sacrifice,
Came around, never broken.
Down by the people if they let you breathe
Don't give a damn if you still can't see,
Traveling a street that I did not go,
Leaves like ton to the winter load.
Down in the valley where the church bells cry,
I'll leave them over to your eyes,
Woah, I am one,
Woah, I am one,
I am one.
