<song artist="Jake_Bugg" title="The_Love_We're_Hoping_For">
When the morning was clear
Blackened affairs
And she could not breathe
Cause she felt scared
Couldn't help but stare
Out of the window
Even though she wouldn't go outside
She wouldn't answer the door
Curtains were drawn
And the house was cold
Her children were old
And they did not care
That's what she thought
When they tried to help
But she wouldn't answer the door
And the love we're hoping for is dying
Just like this city, that we're all in
As time went on
She felt she belonged
In a trapped domain
Drove her insane
And the men she loved
Over the years
They would only use her
They would only use her
Cause the love we're hoping for is dying
Just like this city, that we're all in
When the morning was clear
Blackened affairs
And she could not breathe
Cause she felt scared
Couldn't help but stare
Out of the window
Even though she never went outside
And the love we're hoping for is dying
Just like this city, that we're all in
And the love were hoping for is dying
Just like this city, that we're all in
