<song artist="Jake_Bugg" title="Taste_It">
Fill my head with the future
Fill my eyes with the sky
The hole of my life
Getting left behind
But I've never felt more alive
High speed conversations
Speeding on down the life
Looked in your eye,
Said the saddest goodbye
But I've never felt more alive
I can taste it
In my mouth it's just so bittersweet
It's right there in your eyes of apple green
It should be easy but it's hard to leave
Went down in a firey Zeppelin
You don't know if you don't try
Nothing but my shirt
And I walked away hurt
But I've never felt more alive
Talk on a bad connection
Think I might have fused a wire
You're on the other side
As our voices die
But I've never felt more alive
I can taste it
In my mouth it's just so bittersweet
It's right there in your eyes of apple green
It should be easy but it's hard to leave
The endless road between us
Man it's been a long hard drive
You play for it in the morning
When your best friend is the night
Flyin' all around
Never looking' down
No I've never felt more alive
Journey's going fast I hope it's gonna last
Cos I never felt more alive
I can taste it
In my mouth it's just so bittersweet
It's right there in your eyes of apple green
It should be easy but it's hard to leave
