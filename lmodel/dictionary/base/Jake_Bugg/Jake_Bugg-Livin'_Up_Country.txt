<song artist="Jake_Bugg" title="Livin'_Up_Country">
For now we're living in the country
I was working up until I fell
I only went down, my ship had already sailed
I met a girl out in Memphis, is was going well I thought at first
She never said bye, she left when she I'd fell
And if I could understand
I'd probably get some rest at least
Would I fight to take a stand,
In the middle of (?)
Never have to look for the man
When I were movin out the country
Found my lucky pardon, I was saved
Couldn't get out, I found not check in the mail
So I went up to Nashville
It was going well but then went stale
I couldn't get by, lucky to live to tell the tale
And if I could understand
I'd probably get some rest at least
Would I fight to take a stand,
In the middle of (?)
Never have to look for the man
And if I could understand
I'd probably get some rest at least
Would I fight to take a stand,
In the middle of (?)
Never have to look for the man
Said never look back
Never have to look out for the man
