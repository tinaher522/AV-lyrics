<song artist="Jake_Bugg" title="There's_A_Beast_And_We_All_Feed_It">
They grin but they don't mean it
They sing but they don't feel it
They're gone but they don't see it
They can call but they can't heed it
They think but they don't speak it
There's a beast eating every bit of beauty
And they all feed it
Stop a moment, try to freeze it
They find and they don't seek it
At the bar but they can't meet it
Try their best but they can't beat it
Nice car, somebody keys it
There's a beast eating every bit of beauty
And yes they feed it
I'm not a finger pointer
I will not cry your name
For yeah brothers and sisters
We are one and the same
But when my sister suffers
And when my mother cries
All I want to do
Is look in someone's eyes and say
You sleep but you don't dream it
You're sly but you don't seem it
You're busy as a flea pit
You struggle to perceive it
Is it hard to believe it
There's a beast eating every bit of beauty
And yes you feed it
I'm not a finger pointer
I will not cry your name
For yeah brothers and sisters
We are one and the same
But when my sister suffers
I am my mother's child
All I want to do
Is look in someone's eyes and say
Somehow we'd better speak it
We're scared someone will tweet it
It's on the wall but you won't read it
It's gone before you see it
We all dread to repeat it
There's a beast eating every bit of beauty
And yes we all feed it
