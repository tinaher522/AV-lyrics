<song artist="Jake_Bugg" title="Never_Wanna_Dance">
And I don't know if I know ya
I know it sounds bad
And I don't know if I need ya
I know I must be mad
And if suddenly you leave
How we learn to stay?
'Cause you don't need a guy like me
Who never wants to dance
And I don't know if I need ya
I know it might be cruel
And I don't think that I love ya
I know I'm such a fool
But I'll be waiting by the phone
Waiting up for hours
But I'll be waiting all alone
For a love that's not out
And if suddenly you leave
How we learn to stay?
'Cause you don't need a guy like me
Who never wants to dance
Never wants to dance
