<song artist="Jake_Bugg" title="All_That">
I was a man
Who lifted his head
When times of heartache
Were holding him back from all that
When I was in New York
I met a girl
Left all her friends
And she's running away from all that
She ain't got worries
She lives by the ocean
And she's got all that
The one who is all that
Yeah, she's got all that
When I was in L.A
She drifted away
She spoke of freedom, fame and all of all that
She ain't got worries
She lives by the ocean
And she's got all that
The one who is all that
Yeah, she's got all that
Yeah, she's got all that
