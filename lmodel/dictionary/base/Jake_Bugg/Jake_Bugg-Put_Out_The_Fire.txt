<song artist="Jake_Bugg" title="Put_Out_The_Fire">
When you try to get too close
In your flammable clothes
Step to the flames
But it isn't a taste
Leave it to the rain
Don't put out the fire
Put out the fire
Traveling long ground
Panic because it's a sign
It's moving really fast
So don't put out the fire
Put out the fire
Put out the fire
When you're trynna be so smart
When the forest ain't so dark
Flames cut through the trees
Grow within the breeze
You wake up on your runnin
But you'd never put out the fire
Put out the fire
It will catch real soon
And take you to your tome
It's closing in quickly
So you better put out the fire
Put out the fire
Put out the fire
When you find yourself in close
In between that heat that rose
Chocked on the smoke
Felt it in your throat
The drought rovocked you
That you're never putting out the fire
Put out the fire
Only in doubt
I'ma getting out
I'm never gonna breath
Cause I'll never put out the fire
Put out the fire
Put out the fire
