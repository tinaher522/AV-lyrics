<song artist="Jake_Bugg" title="Trouble_Town">
Stuck in speed bump city
Where the only thing that's pretty
Is the thought of getting out
There's a tower block overhead
All you've got's your benefits
And you're barely scraping by
In this trouble town
Troubles are found
In this trouble town
Words do get 'round
Kick the bottom make troubles flee
Smoke until our eyes would bleed
Sparkle pop the seed
Hear the sirens down the street
The kids get light on their feet
Or they'll be in the back seat
In this trouble town
Troubles are found
Sitting on the pavement
Boy you've missed your payment
And they're gonna find you soon
If there's a beating in the rain
If there's a little bit of pain, man
You're the one it happens to
If I talk of getting out
I only hear the laughter loud
It's gotten ugly at home
Somewhere there's a secret road
To take me far away I know
But til then I am hollow
In this trouble town
Troubles are found
In this trouble town
Fools are found
Sitting on the pavement
Boy you've missed your payment
And they're gonna find you soon
If there's a beating in the streets
If there's a feeling of defeat
You're the one it happens to
Stuck in speed bump city
Where the only thing that's pretty
Is the thought of getting out
