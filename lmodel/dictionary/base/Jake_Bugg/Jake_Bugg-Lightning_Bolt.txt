<song artist="Jake_Bugg" title="Lightning_Bolt">
Morning
It's another pure grey morning
Don't know what the day is holding
And I get up fightin'
Hoping I walk right into
The path of a lightning bolt
The siren
Of an ambulance comes howling
Right through the centre of town and
No one blinks an eye
And I look up to the sky
For the path of a lighting bolt
Met her
As the angels parted for her
But she only brought me torture
But that's what happens
When it's youthat's standing
In the path of a lightning bolt
Everyone I see just wants to walk with gritted teeth
But I just stand by and I wait my time
They say you gotta toe the line
They want the water not the wine
But when I see signs 
I'll jump on that lightning bolt
And chances
People tell you not to take chances
And they tell you that there aren't any answers
And I was starting to agree
But I awoke suddenly
In the path of a lightning bolt
And fortune
People talking all about fortune
Do you make it or does it just call you.
In the blinking of an eye
Just another passerby
In the path of a lightning bolt
Everyone I see just walks the walk
With gritted teeth
But I just stand by
And I wait my time
They say you gotta toe the line
They want the water not the wine
But when I see signs
I'll jump on that lightning bolt
In silence
I was lying back gazing skyward
When the moment got shattered
I remembered what she said
And then she fled into the path of a lightning bolt
