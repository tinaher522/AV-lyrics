<song artist="Jake_Bugg" title="Someone_Told_Me">
Am I crazy or am I blind?
Someone told me I'm out my mind
Oh
Someone told me girl I liked
Fell in love and all I did was cry
Oh
Someone hold me, I'm done with this game
Said I'm sorry, but I'm not to blame, what a shame
Oh
Tried to break from this lonely pain
Someone told me I'm just insane
Oh
Broke my heart when I knew
That I could never be with you
Oh
Someone love me, but not today
Will you show me? Show me a way, how to love
Oh
Someone told me a girl I liked
Fell in love and all did was cry
Oh
