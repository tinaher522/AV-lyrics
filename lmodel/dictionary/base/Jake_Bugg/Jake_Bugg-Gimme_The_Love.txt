<song artist="Jake_Bugg" title="Gimme_The_Love">
Stick lights and rounds about the old days
Keeping rich just to make new waves
I've thought about it in a few ways
Pull back, tap on the pale blaze
Middle road, the world 'bout the game played
So focus is hard on the airplane
Tryna make it sound like the new phase
It's only gonna be the same
Baring down and words rolling deep heat
Steer back and trying to give it upbeat
Force fits talk about the old streets
Brick wall hit by the concrete
Throw band back in his pony
Hard to tell if any of them all needs
Back in time, think what the old me
It's only gonna be the same
Just gimme the love
Just gimme the love
Just gimme the love
Just gimme the love
Just gimme the love
Just gimme the love
Just gimme the love
Just gimme the love
Just gimme the love
It's only gonna be the same
Shakes hard, turning out to get paid
Bad sound sees the people real fake
Pushing on her heart thats allready been made
Coming up fast, cut glass the next take
Better put your sticker on cause you gotta break
Late nights make you walk sideways
And now were gonna party my way
It's only gonna be the same
Just gimme the love
Just gimme the love
Just gimme the love
Just gimme the love
Just gimme the love
Just gimme the love
Just gimme the love
Just gimme the love
It's only gonna be the same
Just gimme the love
Just gimme the love
Just gimme the love
Just gimme the love
Just gimme the love
Just gimme the love
Just gimme the love
Just gimme the love
It's only gonna be the same
Just gimme the love
Just gimme the love
Just gimme the love
Just gimme the love
Just gimme the love
Just gimme the love
Just gimme the love
Just gimme the love
Its never gonna be the same.
