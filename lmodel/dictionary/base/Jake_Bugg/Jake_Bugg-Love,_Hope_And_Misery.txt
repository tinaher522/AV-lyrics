<song artist="Jake_Bugg" title="Love,_Hope_And_Misery">
Crying for the one who doesn't love you
All you feel is the pain
You don't know why he doesn't want you
He hasn't called for days
So dry those eyes and don't be afraid
Cos the rhythm of lovers ain't the same
No you don't know, it don't come easy come easy
They say it comes in threes; love, hope and misery
And the first two were gone and tell me if I'm wrong
I hope that I am and you don't hate me
Don't be mad
I'm just a man
And I know and I know and I know and I know
And I know and I know that you must hate me
Holding back the reasons not to love you
Try to find the way
But when you're feeling down and lonely
It makes hard to say
So dry those eyes and don't be afraid
Cos the rhythm of lovers ain't the same
No you don't know it don't come easy, come easy
They say it comes in threes; love, hope and misery
And the first two were gone and tell me if I'm wrong
I hope that I am and you don't hate me
Don't be mad
I am just a man
And I know and I know and I know
That you must hate me
As I think about the only way that you know t0 love
No this feeling can't be right if it don't mean much
No this feeling ain't right if it don't mean much
I can't be here for you
No, I can't live a lie, woman, that you must know
And this feeling can't be right if it moves so slow
No, this feeling ain't right if it moves so slow
I can't be here with you
They say it comes in threes; love, hope and misery
And the first two were gone and tell me if I'm wrong
I hope that I am and you don't hate me
Don't be mad
I am just a man
And I know and I know and I know and I know
And I know and I know that you must hate me
