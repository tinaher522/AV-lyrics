<song artist="Jake_Bugg" title="Storm_Passes_Away">
As the clouds roll by
I can see the sunshine
Mmmhmmm
'Cause it's sad and slow
And oh so close
We fell together and made our way
But now it seems
You don't need me
Where will you go when the storm passes away
'Cause I'm on my knees
Turn off the darkness please
Where will you go?
And they keep telling me
I'm older than I'm supposed to be
You will go when the storm passes away
I'll keep the storm if I can keep you
I'll live in the rain if you will too
We can ride together
And we can ride the weather
'Cause I've lost my stance
Just like a fallen man
Oh, the things I've hoped you would say
Your radiance runs deep
In my colour scheme
Where will you go when the storm washes you away?
'Cause I'm on my knees
Turn off the darkness please
Where will you go
'Cause they keep telling me
I'm older than I'm supposed to be
You will go when the storm passes away
Where will you go when the storm passes away?
