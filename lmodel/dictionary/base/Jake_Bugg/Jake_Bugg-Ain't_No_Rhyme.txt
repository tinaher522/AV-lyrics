<song artist="Jake_Bugg" title="Ain't_No_Rhyme">
Keep up, keep up and listen slow
Trying to picture this but still nobody knows
Where the people age quick but still they never grow
Where the men keep bluffing till they're toe to toe
A place where your friends and foes they stoop low
Ready to boast soon as they made a bit of dough
Can't really blame 'em for the life that they chose
Cause I knew that all of them are in the same boat
This ain't no rhyme
This ain't no rhyme
This ain't no rhyme
This ain't no rhyme
Enough blues here for the edge of you seat
Never hear anything about it on the TV
Only about who dough, make the tax payer bleed
Oh, and the corporation greed
We live in a world of vulturous thieves
Where you can't just wind up the dividing stream
And when you're in the middle, which side do you lean?
I must say it's hard being in between
This ain't no rhyme
This ain't no rhyme
This ain't no rhyme
This ain't no rhyme
I understand that it must be a hard life
I know I'm lucky and can't sympathise
Patronising would be trying to give advice
Come on Curtis just put down the knife
I knew from his eyes he wasn't gonna think twice
Put your mask on before committing crimes
These kids need to think about time inside
Cause a dagger through the heart comes at a price
This ain't no rhyme
This ain't no rhyme
This ain't no rhyme
This ain't no rhyme
Keep up, keep up and listen slow
Trying to picture this but still nobody knows
Where the people age quick but still they never grow
Where the men keep bluffing till they're toe to toe
A place where your friends and foes they stoop low
Ready to boast soon as they made a bit of dough
Can't really blame 'em for the life that they chose
Cause I knew that all of them are in the same boat
It sounds like a place that you don't wanna go
But this is the place that I call home
This ain't no rhyme
This ain't no rhyme
This ain't no rhyme
This ain't no rhyme
This ain't no rhyme
This ain't no rhyme
This ain't no rhyme
This ain't no rhyme
