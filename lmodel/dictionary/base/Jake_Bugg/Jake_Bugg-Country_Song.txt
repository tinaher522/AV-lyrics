<song artist="Jake_Bugg" title="Country_Song">
Gonna sing you an old country song, from the heart
So I can cry your all night and call you when I'm sad
When you have gone run so far
From me, in the tree so far
Walking down that old country lane, drops of rain
Call upon the ones who call your name
Will I see you again and please just come on back home to me
To me so I'm not all alone
Gonna sing you an old country song, from the heart
From the strings of this old rusty guitar
