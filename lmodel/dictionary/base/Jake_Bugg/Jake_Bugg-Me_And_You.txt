<song artist="Jake_Bugg" title="Me_And_You">
All the time people follow us where we go
We both should believe the path that we chose
And I'll hold you with such delicacy
No they won't catch you and me
It's all over all of the time
And if you want to I don't mind
Please don't leave it, I don't know what to do
No they won't catch me and you
There are too many flashes and guards around me
There is too little time and places to see
And we can wait so patiently
Cause they won't catch you and me
It's all over all of the time
And if you want to I won't mind
Please don't leave it, I don't know what to do
No they won't catch me and you
And all of these people want us to fail
I won't let that happen now
Just you believe me, I'll hide you discreetly
Discreetly from this cold world
It's all over all of the time
If you want to, I won't mind
Please don't leave it, I don't know what to do
'Cause they won't catch me and you
No, they won't catch me and you
No, they won't catch me and you
