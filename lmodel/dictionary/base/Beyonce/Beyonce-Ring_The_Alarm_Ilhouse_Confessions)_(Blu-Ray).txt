Ring the alarm
I been through this too long
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm
Ring the alarm
I been through this too long
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm
She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats
(If I let you go)
Sit in the house off the coast
(If I let you go)
She gon' take everything I own
(If I let you go)
I can't let you go
Damned if I let you go
She gon' rock the V.V.S. stones
(If I let you go)
Cruise in the 'Bach or the Rolls
(If I let you go)
She gon' pocket everything I tote
(If I let you go)
I can't let you go
Damned if I let you go
Tell me how should I feel
When I know what I know
And my female intuition
Telling me you a dog?
People told me 'bout the flames
I couldn't see through the smoke
When I need answers
Accusations, what you mean you gon' choke?
You can't stay, you gotta go
Ain't no other chick spendin' yo' dough
This is taking a toll, the way the story unfolds
Not the picture-perfect movie everyone would have saw
She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats
(If I let you go)
Sit in the house off the coast
(If I let you go)
She gon' take everything I own
(If I let you go)
I can't let you go
Damned if I let you go
She gon' rock the V.V.S. stones
(If I let you go)
Cruise in the 'Bach or the Rolls
(If I let you go)
She gon' pocket everything I tote
(If I let you go)
I can't let you go
Damned if I let you go
Ring the alarm
I been through this too long
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm
Ring the alarm
I been through this too long
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm
Tell me how should I feel
When you made me belong
And the thought of you just touching her is what I hate most
I don't want you, but I want it, and I can't let it go
To know you give it to her like you gave it to me, come on
He so done, workin' 'em both
She gon' love that shit, I know
I done put in a call--time to ring the alarm
'Cause you ain't never seen a fire like the one I'm gon' cause
She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats
(If I let you go)
Sit in the house off the coast
(If I let you go)
She gon' take everything I own
(If I let you go)
I can't let you go
Damned if I let you go
She gon' rock the V.V.S. stones
(If I let you go)
Cruise in the 'Bach or the Rolls
(If I let you go)
She gon' pocket everything I tote
(If I let you go)
I can't let you go
Damned if I let you go
How can you look at me
And not see all the things that I kept only just for you?
Why would you risk it, baby?
Is that the price that I pay?
But this is my show, and I won't let you go
All is been paid for, and it's mine
How could you look at me
And not see all the things?
She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats
(If I let you go)
Sit in the house off the coast
(If I let you go)
She gon' take everything I own
(If I let you go)
I can't let you go
Damned if I let you go
She gon' rock the V.V.S. stones
(If I let you go)
Cruise in the 'Bach or the Rolls
(If I let you go)
She gon' pocket everything I tote
(If I let you go)
I can't let you go
Damned if I let you go
