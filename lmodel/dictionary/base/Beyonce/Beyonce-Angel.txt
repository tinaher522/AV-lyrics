This is for my mother
This is for the mother future

You are my best friend
And I love you
You were always there to love me,
When I didn't even love myself,
You bring out the best in me
And I thank you
Thank you for my life,
Thanks for your advise your wisdom,
And your strength

You are my messenger,

- Verse 3 -
And if it wasn't for you,
And if I didn't know you,
And if you never reached me,
And if you didn't teach me,
I wouldn't be, who I am right now
I wouldn't give, what I give right now
I wouldn't think, what I think right now
I'm thanking you, Im thanking you.

Thank you I'm so greatful
