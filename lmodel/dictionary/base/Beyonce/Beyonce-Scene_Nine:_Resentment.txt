<song artist="Beyonce" title="Scene_Nine:_Resentment">
I wish I could believe you; then I'll be all right
But now everything you told me really don't apply
To the way I feel inside
Loving you was easy once upon a time
But now my suspicions of you have multiplied
And it's all because you lied
[Chorus]
I only give you a hard time
'Cause I can't go on and pretend like
I haven't tried to forget this
But I'm much too full of resentment
Just can't seem to get over the way you hurt me
Don't know how you gave another who didn't mean a thing
The very thing you gave to me
I thought I could forgive you, and I know you've changed
As much as I wanna trust you, I know it ain't the same
And it's all because you lied
[Chorus]
I may never understand why
I'm doing the best that I can, and I
I tried and I tried to forget this
But I'm much too full of resentment
I'll always remember feeling like I was no good
Like I couldn't do it for you like your mistress could
And it's all because you lied
Loved you more than ever
More than my own life
The best part of me I gave you
It was sacrifice
And it's all because you lied
I only give you a hard time
'Cause I can't go on and pretend like
I tried and I tried to forget this
But I'm too damn full of resentment
I know she was attractive, but I was here first
Been ridin' with you for six years
Why did I deserve to be treated this way by you, you?
I know you're probably thinking "what's up with B?"
I been crying for too long; what did you do to me?
I used to be so strong, but now you took my soul
I'm crying--can't stop crying, can't stop crying
You could have told me that you wasn't happy
I know you didn't wanna hurt me
But look what you done to me now
I gotta look at her in her eyes and see she's had half of me
How could you lie?
