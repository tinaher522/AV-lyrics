And everybodies warning you about it,
And once you taste you can't live without it.
Not cause you choose to not live without it 
It's now a part of you.

And everybody warning you about it
And once you taste you can't live...

[Verse 4 - Beyonce]
Now you wanna be seen,
Male groupies.
Now you've become what you once despised.
James Dean,
John Beluchi,
blow your whole life
tryna live in the lights.
Heroin's followin, Marilyn
Hoppin' over the edge
just like Janice Joplin.
River Phoenix,
Jimi Hendrix,
Jimmy Morrison,
All of them ended by
Hollywood
Thank God for Hollywood
Hollywood...
[Outro: Beyonce]
I see your face and a
you wanna touch it and,
come to my place and we
can discuss it..Hollywood,
Welcome to Hollywood.
