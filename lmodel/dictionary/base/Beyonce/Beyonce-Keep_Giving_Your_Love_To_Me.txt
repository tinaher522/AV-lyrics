Ay yo B This a good look right here Yeah Bad Boy baby Uh ay yo B
I been wantin' to explain to you
what it is that you do to me
Got me open I am so in love with lovin' you
Touch in places no one else has 
ever made me feel incredible
When you touch me I feel sexy 
No one else like you
Got me goin' off all the love you give me(you give me)
I'd be crazy to ever want to leave
I love the way your hands alone run by me (touch me)
Please don't say your gonna stop lovin' me (so keep on)
Keep givin' your love to me (oh)
Keep givin' your love to me (oh)
When you givin' yor love to me (oh)

When you givin' yor love to me (oh)

How could someone be so sexy 
and love like you do
Baby do you understand the power that you possess over me
Can't escape this feeling and I don't think I want to 
Got me goin' off all the love you give me(you give me)
I'd be crazy to ever want to leave
I love the way your hands alone run by me (touch me)
