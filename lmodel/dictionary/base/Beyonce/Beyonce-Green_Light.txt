Give it to mama.
Give it, give it... give it to mama. (Mama...) [Oh!]
Give it... Give it to mama. (Mama.)
For some strange reason (huh?), you done pleasin' me like it's ok; (Oh, oh...)
Like a perm that's been left too long (It's 'bout to burn!), the result is it just won't take... (Oh, oh...)
I can see... (Now it's all coming so clear to me now...)
I can see... (Misinterpreted all of my na√Øveness...)
Was just thinking if I had no you, then I can't do;
My stock just went up over $2 million...
So if you want to [uh-huh, uh-uh], you got the green light... [Uh-huh, uh-uh...]
So if you want to [uh-huh, uh-uh], you got the green light... [Uh-huh, uh-uh...]
So if you want to (want to, want to...) [uh-huh, uh-uh], you got the green light... [Uh-huh, uh-uh...]

Go! Go! Go! Go! (Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go,)
Go! Go! (Go, go, go, go, go!) 
Red light! (Uh...) Green light!
Some see me, say I should be trophied 'cause it gets no stronger; (Oh, oh...)
Ladies, ya'll know (Yeah, girl, ya'll know!) this pimp shit gets no older!
Is that a threat? (What's another threat?) Yep! (That's another threat!)
I'm immune, you can't get no colder!
You got the green light (Go!), you the king, right? (Roll!)
You holdin' up traffic - green means go!
[Go...] Go! Go! Go! Go! (Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.)
Go! Go! Go! Go! (Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.) [Go...]
[Go!] Go! Go! Go! Go! (Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go,)

(Give it to mama.)
Ain't no problem, you can go - I will find somebody else;
[Go! Go! Go! Go! (Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.)]
S'alright, I'll move along - green light so you can...
[Go! Go! Go! Go! (Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.)]
Go...
[Go! Go! Go! Go! (Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go,)]
Go, go, go...
[Go! Go! (Go, go, go, go, go!) 
Red light! (Uh...) Green light!]
I gave all I could give - My love, my heart; (My heart...)
Now we're facing the end (the end), from what you did from the start, my love...
You're holdin' up traffic, green means go!
So if you want to (Go...) [uh-huh, uh-uh], you got the green light... (Go, go!) [Uh-huh, uh-uh...]
So if you want to (Go...) [uh-huh, uh-uh], you got the green light... (Go, oh...)[Uh-huh, uh-uh...]
