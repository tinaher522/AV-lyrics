<song artist="Beyonce" title="If_Looks_Could_Kill_(You_Would_Be_Dead)">
Beyonce' - Sweetness flowing like a faucet
Body bangin' up corset
Brothas wanna toss it
But they lost, cause my game made them forfeit
Slicker than a porpis and thicker than a horses
Carmen Brown got the whole town speechless
I'll stick to my thesis, I'll stick to my features
Brothas trying to hold, but thier game never reaches
Most of these cats are like the middle of peaches
I see you looking at, but what you looking at?
You in a bar, wanna twist me like a bottle cap
Mos Def  - I'm trying to holla Miss, to see if you gonna holla back
Beyonce' - Your game is whack, and know you will not get your quarter back
See this is Carmen, curves like a cul-de-sac
skin coffee and cream, your donuts, you ain't dunkin that
Mos Def  - But this is Miller, Lieutenant, if you're wondering
Sarpong  - And I'm the thag
Mos Def  - Mel Gibson
Sarpong  - Danny Gloverin'
Beyonce' - But I'm not hearing you, you might as well be mumbling
See, I have dreams with a man, what will become of him?
There's not a kid out here who can make me believe
I should post pone my goals, he got tricks up his sleeve?
Whole bar full of cuffs and you ain't locking me down
Mos Def  - I got a warrant for ya heart and a bedroom and trial
Sarpong  - Get a pardon if you come with the Sergeant, now
Beyonce' - Give me a chair, cause I don't care, I ain't feeling your style
Chorus
Mos Def  - Yo, I'm trying to get with you shorty
Beyonce' - But I'm not feeling you
Sarpong  - But I'm an officer shorty
Beyonce' - My looks are killing you

Mos Def  - Murder One will get you under the covers
Beyonce' - Game taller, man slaughter, I ain't feeling you brothas
Mos Def  - Yo, I'm trying to get with you shorty
Beyonce' - But I'm not feeling you
Sarpong  - But I'm an officer shorty
Beyonce' - My looks are killing you
Mos Def  - Murder One will get you under the covers
Beyonce' - Game taller, man slaughter, I ain't feeling you brothas
Eyes like the ocean
Mos Def  - Ma, I got some lotion
Hold ya thighs, raise 'em high and daddy long stroke you
Beyonce' - Hair like forever
Sarpong  - Swear I could do it better
Take my gun out the holster, I still got the Barretta
Beyonce' - Brothas sweat Carmen like Patrick Ewing, but that kid...
Mos Def  - Don't waste your time, he ain't no doing, he's just a Sergeant
Passing out tickets for parking
Sarpong  - Chickenheads clucking
Beyonce' - Pitiful bulls barking
See this is Carmen, voice sweet as marvin
I turn out lights, with the switch, when I'm walking
Girls getting jealous, cause they man always hawking
Even got Lou looking at me like he stalking
And I got a mind too
I wouldn't bless you, 
if your first name was "Hachu" on Sunday singing gospel
Mos Def  - You ain't a dime, just a nickel acting hostel
Beyonce' - I'm headed for the big time , I'm bouncing on this side-show...
