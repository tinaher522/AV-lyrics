(feat. Trina)
(Beyonce:)
You must not kno bout me 
You must not kno bout me 
(Trina:)
Ughh taxi come pick this nigga up; a used condom in his truck 
Used to trick it wit tha sluts; tellin me i'm number 1 
but u was better than tha rest; truth be told u'z a mess 
who loved tha playin games; rollercoaster wit my brain 
i'd cry myself to sleep cuz it hurt so bad 
im askin how could u expose everythin we had 
now i gotta go inside the little black bag 
i bet he'll be back tryna wave tha white flag 
nigga-nerve of u sayin i wouldnt find another 
u dont bump yo head, u gon need me sucka 
changin my number; i aint thinkin bout you 
im in love wit myself; if u wanna kno tha truth 
(Beyonce:)
In tha closet.. that's my stuff 
Yes, if I bought it babii please dont touch 
And keep talking that mess, that's fine 
But could you walk and talk at the same time 
And It's my mine name that is on that Jag 
So remove your bags let me call you a cab 
Standing in the front yard telling me 
How I'm such a fool - Talking about 
How I'll never ever find a man like you 
You got me twisted 
You must not know bout me 
You must not know bout me 
(Beyonce &amp; Trina:)
I could have another you in a minute 
Matter fact he'll be here in a minute babii 
(Trina:)
Keep talkin slick... 
Ones a killa; ones a drug deala 
one who wines *&amp;* dines me wit million dollar even tho rap it to equality 
I even kno a rapper who wanna dig in it 
Or my football playa friend whose been beggin me to end it 
My attorney on Brickle wit a big popsicle 
who aint neva had a hard time aimin at tha middle 
MY NBA All Star who make it wit a sizzle 
That's tha shizzle my nizzle; he think his time when he nibble
Don't make me remind u; to tha left, to tha left 
(Beyonce:)
Everythin u own in tha box to tha left 
In tha closet.. that's my stuff 
Yes, if I bought it babii please dont touch 
And keep talkin that mess, that's fine 
But could u walk and talk at tha same time 
And It's my mine name that is on that Jag 
So remove your bags let me call you a cab 
Standing in tha front yard tellin me 
How I'm such a fool - Talkin bout 
How I'll never ever find a man like you 
You got me twisted 
You must not kno bout me 
You must not kno bout me 
I could have another you in a minute 
Matter fact he'll be here in a minute babii 
You must not kno bout me 
You must not kno bout me 
I could have another u by tomorrow 
So, don't u ever for a second get to thinkin; u're irreplaceable 
So, go ahead and get gone 
call up that chick *&amp;* see if she's home 
Oops, I bet ya thought that I didn't kno 
What did u think I was putting u out for? 
Cause u was untrue 
Rolling her around in tha car that I bought u 
Baby u dropped them keys; hurry up before ur taxi leaves 
Standing in tha front yard telling me 
How I am such a fool - Talking about 
How I'll never ever find a man like u 
You got me twisted 
You must not kno bout me 
You must not kno bout me 
I could have another u in a minute 
Matter fact he'll be here in a minute babii 
You must not kno bout me 
You must not kno bout me 
I could have another u by tomorrow 
So, don't u ever for a second get to thinkin; u're irreplaceable 
So since I'm not ur everything 
How about I'll be nothing 
Nothing at all to u 
Baby I wont shead a tear for u 
I won't lose a wink of sleep 
Cause tha truth of tha matter is 
Replacing u is so easy 
To tha left, to tha left 
To tha left, to tha left 
To tha left, to tha left; everythin u own in a box to tha left 
To tha left, to tha left; 
Don't u ever for a second get to thinkin; u're irreplaceable 
You must not kno bout me 
You must not kno bout me 
I could have another u in a minute 
matter fact he'll be be here in a minute - babii 
You must not know about me 
You must not know about me 
I can have another u by tomorrow 
Don't you ever for a second get to thinkinnnnnn.... 
You must not kno bout me 
You must not kno bout me 
I could have another u in a minute 
matter fact he'll be be here in a minute 
You can pack all ur bagsss 
we're finished 
you made ur bed; now lay in it 
I could have another u by tomorrow 
So, don't u ever for a second get to thinkin; u're irreplaceableeee
