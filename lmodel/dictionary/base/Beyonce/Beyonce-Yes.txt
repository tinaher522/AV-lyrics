Uh-huh...
Uh-huh...
Uh-huh...
Uh-huh...
Uh-huh...
Uh-uh...
I said yes to your number, and yes to you dating me;
"Yes, we can be together, but you gotta wait for me..."
The first time I say no, it's like I never said yes... (It's like I never said yes...)
I said, "Yes, we can be together, yes, you can stay with me..."
But when I say, "No, not tonight," you actin' so ungratefully;
The first time I say no, it's like I never said yes... (It's like I never said yes...)
You was on the wall, I was with my crew;
You was watching me, baby, I was watching you...
Slowly, you walked over - I maintained my cool;
You said hello to me, I said hello to you...
You asked me where I'm from, I asked you what you do;
You somehow intrigued me - I thought you were so cool...
Somewhere between hi and goodbye, I felt so comfortable;
I felt like we could talk all night, so I gave my number to you...
I said yes to your number, and yes to you dating me;
"Yes, we can be together, but you gotta wait for me..."
The first time I say no, it's like I never said yes... (It's like I never said yes...)
I said, "Yes, we can be together, yes, you can stay with me..."
But when I say, "No, not tonight," you actin' so ungratefully;
The first time I say no, it's like I never said yes... (It's like I never said yes...)
"Certainly you can call me, baby, I love to hear from you..."
"Yes, of course, you can come and see me, boy;
Wanna get to know you more, sure, I’m feelin' you..."
"No, baby, not yet, we can’t take that next step;
Why you gettin’ so upset? Boy, you
Act as though I never told you yes before - You are so ungrateful! Mm-mm-mm..."
You was at my house, I was sittin' on my couch;
You was really buggin', so I told you to get out...
I had been misjudging you - You had a lot of nerve;
You too damn old to be so immature! I hope you learn...
You said I move too slow, I showed you to the door;
You said you'd call me later, I said, "Don't call no more..."
It is cool if you can't wait for me, I'm glad you let me know,
'Cause you showed me your true face, baby, the first time I said no...
I said yes to your number, (Yes...) and yes to you dating me;
"Yes, (Ooh...) we can be together, but you gotta (Mm-mm...) wait for me..."
The first time I say no, it's like I never said yes... (It's like I never said yes...)
(Ooh, I said yes!) I said "Yes, we can be together, yes, you can stay with me..."
(Oh...) But when I say, "No, not tonight," you actin' so ungratefully;
(The very first time I say no...) The first time I say "No," it’s like I never said "Yes..." (It's like I never said "Yes..." before...)
I said yes to your number, and yes to you dating me;
"Yes, we can be together, but you gotta wait for me..."
The first time I say "No," it’s like I never said "Yes..." (It's like I never said "Yes...")
