<song artist="Beyonce" title="The_Closer_I_Get_To_You">
Luther Vandross
The closer I get to you 
The more you make me see 
By giving me all you've got (Tell me more) 
Your love has captured me 
Beyoncé
Over and over again 
I try to tell myself that we 
Could never be more than friends 
But all the while, inside, I knew it was real 
The way you make me feel 
Luther Vandross
Lyin' here next to you 
Time just seems to fly 
Needing you more and more (More and more) 
Let's give love a try (Lets give love a try) 
I wanna try love 
Beyoncé
Sweeter and Sweeter, love grows 
And heavens there for those 
Who fool the tricks of time 
With hearts of Love will find 
True love... in a special way 
Luther Vandross
(ohhh closer I get to you baby) 
The more you make me see 
By giving me what you've got 
Both
Your love has captured me 
Beyoncé
Oh Over and Over again 
I try to tell myself that we 
Could never be more than friends 
But all the while, inside, I knew this was real (got to be) Got to be real... 
The way you make me feel (you know you know you know) 
Both
My baby My baby My baby... My love... ohhh... Yeah.... (Come closer now) 
Come a little closer so that we can see into the eyes of love (I want to see into those eyes of love) 
Just a little closer...let me speak to you 
I want to softly tell you something (Here I am and heres my love... I just want you) 
Come a little closer. Let me whisper in your ear 
Cuz i want to tell you something (I want to whisper in your ear... so soft... so come closer) 
Move in real close so we can celebrate 
The way we feel about eachother's loving (Want to tell you words....)
