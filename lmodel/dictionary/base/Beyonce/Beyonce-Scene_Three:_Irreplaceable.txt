<song artist="Beyonce" title="Scene_Three:_Irreplaceable">
To the left, to the left
To the left, to the left
Mmm, to the left, to the left
Everything you own in a box to the left
In the closet, that's my stuff
Yes, if I bought it, please, don't touch
And keep talking that mess--that's fine
But could you walk and talk at the same time?
And it's my name that's on that Jag
So remove your bags; let me call you a cab
Standing in the front yard tellin' me how I'm such a fool
Talkin' 'bout
How I'll never ever find a man like you
You got me twisted
[Chorus]
You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I could have another you in a minute
Matter fact, he'll be here in a minute, baby
You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I can have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinkin'
You're irreplaceable
So go ahead and get gone
Call up that chick and see if she's home
Oops, I bet you thought that I didn't know
What did you think I was putting you out for?
Because you was untrue
Rollin' her around in the car that I bought you
Baby, drop them keys
Hurry up before your taxi leaves
Standing in the front yard tellin' me how I'm such a fool
Talkin' 'bout
How I'll never ever find a man like you
You got me twisted
[Chorus]
You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I will have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinkin'
You're irreplaceable
So since I'm not your everything
How about I'll be nothing
Nothing at all to you
Baby, I won't shed a tear for you (I won't shed a tear)
I won't lose a wink of sleep
'Cause the truth of the matter is
Replacing you is so easy
To the left, to the left
To the left, to the left
Mmm, to the left, to the left
Everything you own in a box to the left
To the left, to the left
Don't you ever for a second get to thinkin'
You're irreplaceable
[Chorus]
You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I can have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinkin'
You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I could have another you in a minute
Matter fact, he'll be here in a minute
You can pack all your bags--we finished
You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me ('cause you made your bed; now lay in it)
I can have another you by tomorrow
Don't you ever for a second get to thinking
You're irreplaceable
