<song artist="Florida_Georgia_Line" title="Smile">
Got on my smell good, got a bottle of feel good
Shining my wheels good, you're looking real good
Take a stack of cash out, I'm bout to blast out
Til I run the gas out, I'm going all out
All I want to see is you have a good time
No I don't care if it takes me all night
I'll give anything to see you look that way
Give me that little love on your pretty face
All I'm waiting is for is for you to just
Lay your pretty head on my shoulder
For a while and find your jam on my radio dial
Girl all I want, is just to see you smile
That pretty little smile
I'll take you out there, in the middle of nowhere
Let down your blonde hair, breathe in that midnight air
Girl we can take a trip, to the river and take a sip
Do a little back flip and kiss kiss kiss your lips
I'll give anything to see you look that way
Give me that little love on your pretty face
All I'm waiting is for is for you to just
Lay your pretty head on my shoulder
For a while and find your jam on my radio dial
Girl all I want, is just to see you smile
That pretty little smile
Girl I just want to make you dance
Give you the best night you ever had
Oh, and girl I want it bad, bad, bad
I'll give anything to see you look that way
Give me that little love on your pretty face
All I'm waiting is for is for you to just
Lay your pretty head on my shoulder
For a while and find your jam on my radio dial
Girl all I want, is just to see you smile
That pretty little smile
