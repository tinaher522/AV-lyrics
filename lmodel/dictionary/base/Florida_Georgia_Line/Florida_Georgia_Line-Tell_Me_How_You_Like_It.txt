<song artist="Florida_Georgia_Line" title="Tell_Me_How_You_Like_It">
Do you like it when the meter's jumpin'?
You like the sound of them horses runnin'?
Do you like it when the tweeter's tweetin'?
Do you like it when the back seat's bumpin'?
Do you like a little kick in your coke?
Do you like it goin' up in smoke?
Do you like it on a gravel road?
We can keep it on the down low
Tell me how you like it (tell me how you like it) 
You know I wanna try it (know I wanna try it)
Baby if you don't mind it (if you don't mind it)
We can kick it down in four and you can drive
Pretty girl you can ride it
We can all night it (we can all night it)
You don't have to hide it (you don't have to hide it)
Just tell me how
Tell me how you like it
Do you like it on a riverbank?
Do you like it when the sun done sank?
Do you like it when the full moon's high
And it's shinin' down into your drink?
Do you like it when the tailgate's down?
Do you like it when we take it to the ground?
Tell me baby, how does that sound?
Either way, you know it's goin' down
Tell me how you like it (tell me how you like it) 
You know I wanna try it (know I wanna try it)
Baby if you don't mind it (if you don't mind it)
We can kick it down in four and you can drive
Pretty girl you can ride it
We can all night it (we can all night it)
You don't have to hide it (you don't have to hide it)
Just tell me how
Tell me how you like it
Baby, why you gotta look so pretty
With your hair so soft and long?
You're damn sure turnin' me on
Tonight, we gettin' out of the city
Leave it all behind, get a little lost
Baby, you make the call
Tell me how you like it (tell me how you like it) 
You know I wanna try it (know I wanna try it)
Baby if you don't mind it (if you don't mind it)
We can kick it down in four and you can drive
Pretty girl you can ride it
We can all night it (we can all night it)
You don't have to hide it (you don't have to hide it)
Just tell me how
Tell me how you like it
Do you like it in the shotgun seat?
With the highway flyin' right under your feet (tell me)
Do you like it with the radio on? (just tell me how)
Tell me how you like it
Do you like it by the bonfire heat?
If it gets too hot, we can take it to the creek (I need to know)
Let's make it last all night long (just tell me how)
Tell me how you like it
