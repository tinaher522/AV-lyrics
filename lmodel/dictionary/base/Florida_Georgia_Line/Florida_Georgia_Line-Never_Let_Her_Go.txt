<song artist="Florida_Georgia_Line" title="Never_Let_Her_Go">
I can see us there on a summer night
With a blanket down, lookin' up at the starry sky
So in love that goodnight kiss never felt so sweet
Didn't know that'd be the last there'd be
But like the leaves, on an autumn tree
When the summer's gone, so was she
She had my heart
At seventeen
Now all I've got
Is her memory
Where she is now
I just don't know
How she got gone when I never let her go
I just know she's out there somewhere
Livin' life with no regrets
I wish I could say the same for me
But I ain't got there
She had my heart
At seventeen
Man I fell so hard
I lost everything
Where she is now
I just don't know
How she got gone
She had my heart
At seventeen
Now all I've got
Is her memory
Where she is now
I just don't know
How she got gone when I never let her go
Never let her go
It was late July in that photograph
I could see her smile, hear her laugh
