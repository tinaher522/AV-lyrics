<song artist="Florida_Georgia_Line" title="Confession">
Rusty barbed wire lines these fields
Gravel dust behind the wheels
Drifting like my mind into the rearview
Jet trails cutting across the sky
I'm rolling through the open wide
Searching for a song to drink beer to
And trying to find a place to disappear to
I light up the night and let it burn
Lean back and watch the sundown fade
Do what I do when life's a little sideways
I take a sip and say a prayer
Wait for a shooting star and stare
Off at the headlights on the highway
That guy in the windshield looking back looks just like me
But there's a crack in the reflection
This is just a moonlight soaked, ring of smoke
Right hand on a cold one confession
Embers in the ashtray glow
like memories that won't let go
I'm out here trying to get 'em untangled
In the darkness on the edge of town
A little lost, a little found
Waiting on a call from an angel
I light up the night and let it burn
Lean back and watch the sundown fade
Do what I do when life's a little sideways
I take a sip and say a prayer
Wait for a shooting star and stare
Off at the headlights on the highway
That guy in the windshield looking back looks just like me
But there's a crack in the reflection
This is just a moonlight soaked, ring of smoke
Right hand on a cold one confession
I light up the night and let it burn
Lean back and watch the sundown fade
Do what I do when life's a little sideways
I take a sip and say a prayer
Wait for a shooting star and stare
Off at the headlights on the highway
That guy in the windshield looking back looks just like me
But there's a crack in the reflection
Hope he's moving in the right direction
This is just a moonlight soaked, ring of smoke
Right hand on a cold one confession
