<song artist="Florida_Georgia_Line" title="What_Are_You_Drinking_About">
Well hey girl, what's a girl like you doing in a place like this? 
With lipstick on the edge of your cocktail glass, you took a sip and it was gone so fast. 
It looks to me like you might need another one, a double one, yeah me too. 
You're too pretty to look so blue, I hope you don't mind me asking you girl..
What are you drinkin' about tonight? 
Are you shootin' down some old love? 
Baby, that makes two of us in the same bar, in the same boat... 
A little bit of mistake, whiskey and a little bit of coke and a whole lot of lonely too...
What are you drinkin' 'bout?
'Cause baby I'm drinkin' 'bout you.
Well hey girl, what's a girl like you doing here feeling like me? 
Memories on the edge of your cocktail glass, with every sip they're fading so fast. 
It looks to me like you might need another one, a double one, yeah me too. 
I'm already forgettin' 'bout who broke my heart when I'm lookin' at you girl..
What are you drinkin' about tonight? 
Are you shootin' down some old love? 
Baby, that makes two of us in the same bar, in the same boat... 
A little bit of mistake, whiskey and a little bit of coke and a whole lot of lonely too...
What are you drinkin' 'bout? 
'Cause baby I'm drinkin' 'bout...
You and me gettin' outta here, disappear, headed south where the coast is clear.
Forget about him, Forget about her,
And all the never were's, never were's, never were meant to be's, 
So baby look in my eyes and tell me..
What are you drinkin' about tonight? 
Are you shootin' down some old love? 
Baby, that makes two of us in the same bar, in the same boat... 
A little bit of mistake, whiskey and a little bit of coke and a whole lot of lonely too...
What are you drinkin' 'bout?
'Cause baby I'm drinkin' 'bout you.
What are you, What are you, What are you drinkin' 'bout baby? 
What are you, What are you, What are you drinkin' 'bout baby? 
What are you, What are you, What are you drinkin' 'bout baby?
