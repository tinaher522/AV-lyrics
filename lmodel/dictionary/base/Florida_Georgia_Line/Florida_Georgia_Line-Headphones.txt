<song artist="Florida_Georgia_Line" title="Headphones">
You were a whip around town
Tinted windows down
Alabama bound
Dixieland delight
You were a summer silhouette
A Sunday cigarette
A hand me down cassette
A turn on a dirt road dime
You were a rock that
Thrown back
George Strait tee too tight
Can't get you out of my head
Out of, out of my head
Out of my headphones
It's like the record stopped spinning
And you're gone again and
I'm stuck here alone
Can't get you out of my head
Out of, out of my head
Out of my headphones
I turn it up, you turn me on
It takes me back
It takes all night long
I'm the Jack without the rocks
A sun without a drop
A quarter in the slot of an unplugged jukebox joint
And I'm a Gibson missin' all of my damn strings
Can't get you out of my head
Out of, out of my head
Out of my headphones
It's like the record stopped spinning
And you're gone again and
I'm stuck here alone
Can't get you out of my head
Out of, out of my head
Out of my headphones
I turn it up, you turn me on
It takes me back
It takes all night long
Yeah it hard to admit it
Your boy is addicted
As soon as I hit it, it plays and I miss it
And now I'm tied to a train
Down memory lane
Stuck on repeat
Repeat the same old same
Can't get you out of my head
Out of, out of my head
Out of my headphones
It's like the record stopped spinning
And you're gone again and
I'm stuck here alone
Can't get you out of my head
Out of, out of my head
Out of my headphones
I turn it up, you turn me on
It takes me back
It takes all night long
Yeah it hard to admit it
Your boy is addicted
As soon as I hit it, it plays and I miss it
And now I'm tied to a train
Down memory lane
Stuck on repeat
Repeat the same old same
Can't get you out of my head, girl
Can't get you out of my head
