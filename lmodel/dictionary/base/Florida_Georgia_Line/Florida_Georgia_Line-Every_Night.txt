<song artist="Florida_Georgia_Line" title="Every_Night">
I don't want to wait until it's Friday
Before we hit it sideways
I'm out in your driveway right now
And we ain't gotta wait until it's your birthday
I'm already thirsty, time to shut the workday on down
Yeah I just dropped you off but I'm back to pick you up
No, I can't get enough, need a little more you in my cup
I want to see you move, get my hands on you
My little déjà vu, we do this every night
We can get to feeling alright right now
Turn it on baby til the sun burns out
You ain't gotta say it girl, I know what you like
We do this every night
Yeah on this trail trail, a little something to sip sip
Don't need no weekend
We do this every night
Hands on your hips and do a little bit of sip sip
A little bit of your sweet kiss
We do this every night
Turn around down Indiana main street
When the song is over we put it on repeat, repeat
Topping off another can of crazy
Neighbors probably hate me
They don't get the way we do it every night
We can get to feeling alright right now
Turn it on baby til the sun burns out
You ain't gotta say it girl, I know what you like
We do this every night
Yeah on this trail trail, a little something to sip sip
Don't need no weekend
We do this every night
Hands on your hips and do a little bit of sip sip
A little bit of your sweet kiss
We do this every night
