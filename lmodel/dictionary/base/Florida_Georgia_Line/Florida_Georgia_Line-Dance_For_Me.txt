<song artist="Florida_Georgia_Line" title="Dance_For_Me">
It's not too late
Let me take you on a midnight drive
I might sound crazy baby
Maybe somewhere under the stars
In my car, in the dark
We can park, I don't care what we do
I just wanna see you
Dance for me, dance for me
Throw it on the floor for me
Dance for me, dance for me
Yeah come on girl
Get your hands in the air
Shake it down like you just don't care
We can do a little double dare
That's it right there, the way you
Dance for me, dance for me
The way you
Dance for me, dance for me
I'm gonna sit back baby
Sip that Jack and watch you move
It won't be long before
I'm swaying right up next to you
In the lights of the night
Burning bright
From up here on my hood
You look so damn good
When you
Dance for me, dance for me
Throw it on the floor for me
Dance for me, dance for me
Yeah come on girl
Get your hands in the air
Shake it down like you just don't care
We can do a little double dare
That's it right there, when you
Dance for me, dance for me
(Come on, come on)
When you
Dance for me, dance for me
Come on girl, let your hair down
Do a little dance for me
Come on girl, let your hair down
Do a little dance for me
I got you and the moon
And the right little tune
And you know what to do
I just wanna see you
Dance for me, dance for me
Throw it on the floor for me
Dance for me, dance for me
Yeah come on girl
Get your hands in the air
Shake it down like you just don't care
We can do a little double dare
That's it right there, when you
Dance for me, dance for me
(Come on, come on)
The way you
Dance for me, dance for me
Yeah, dance for me, dance for me
The way you dance for me, dance for me
Yeah, dance for me, dance for me
The way you dance for me, dance for me
