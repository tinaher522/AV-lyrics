<song artist="Florida_Georgia_Line" title="Black_Tears">
She puts on her work clothes, fishnet pantyhose,
She’s got a nickname that everyone knows at the Gentlemen’s club
She clocks in at midnight, even though it never feels right,
Makes her money one dollar at a time.
Without the makeup, nobody knows her name,
She wears the pain
Black tears, rollin' down, from the eyes of an angel in a sinner’s town
She reveals, they all cheer, then she cries,
Black tears
Jealous of the innocent, sometimes she’s convinced,
The boss man is still a friend she needs.
She’s tried everything, cheap sex and cocaine,
Anything to hide the pain for a little while
Wrong kind of famous in her mama’s eyes, you can tell she knows it when she cries,
Black tears, rolling down from the eyes of an angel in a sinner’s town,
White lights on the mirrors, just won’t hide,
Black tears
She tries and tries so hard to get away
But everybody’s watching,
Black tears, rollin' down, from the eyes of an angel in a sinner’s town,
If all the pain could just disappear she'd quit cryin', she'd quit cryin'
Black tears
