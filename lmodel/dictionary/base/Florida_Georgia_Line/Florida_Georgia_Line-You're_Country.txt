<song artist="Florida_Georgia_Line" title="You're_Country">
If you're anything like me
You like jacked up trucks
Four-wheel drives
And loud straight pipes 
And a big tool box
You like to ride around town
with the windows down 
Singin' 'Song of the South'
If you're anything like me
you're country!
Born and raised in the south
American &amp; proud
where the lost get found,
Livin' off the land
And workin' with our hands 
Till the sun goes down
Mamas home cookin'
Daddy's ass whippin'
And Heaven bound
If you’re anything like me (Yeah)
you’re country.
If you’re anything like me, 
you like to cut off your sleeves. 
Show off your tattoo’s and your battle wounds 
that you got last week.
Brag to your boys
bout the buck you killed
and the girl in your backseat. 
If you’re anything like me, 
you’re country
Born and raised in the south
American and proud
Where the lost gets found
Livin' off the land
And workin' with our hands
Till the sun goes down
Mamas home cookin'
Daddy's ass whippin'
And Heaven bound
If you're anything like me (Yeah)
You're country!
It's all about the moonshine
Midnight campfire
And singin' on Saturday night
We go to church 
Get right
Baby get baptized
We all see the light
Born and raised in the south
American &amp; Proud
Where the lost get found
Livin' off of land, workin' with our hands
Till the sun goes down 
Mamas home cookin'
Daddy's ass whippin'
and heaven bound
If you're anything like me (Yeah)
Born and raised in the south
American and proud
Where the lost get found
Livin' off of land
workin' with our hands
Till the sun goes down
Mamas home cookin'
Daddy's ass whippin'
and Heaven bound
If you're anything like me (Yeah)
If ya play a 6 string (Yeah)
If you got a skull ring (Yeah)
If you're anything like me (Yeah)
You're country!
