<song artist="Florida_Georgia_Line" title="I'm_In_A_Hurry_(And_Don't_Know_Why)">
I'm in a hurry to get things done 
Oh I rush and rush until life's no fun 
All I really gotta do is live and die 
But I'm in a hurry and don't know why
Don't know why I have to drive so fast
My car has nothing to prove 
It's not new 
But it'll do zero to sixty in five point two 
I'm in a hurry to get things done 
Oh I rush and rush until life's no fun 
All I really gotta do is live and die 
But I'm in a hurry and don't know why 
Can't be late, I leave in plenty of time 
Shakin' hands with the clock 
I can't stop 
I'm on a roll and I'm ready to rock 
I'm in a hurry to get things done 
Oh I rush and rush until life's no fun 
All I really gotta do is live and die 
But I'm in a hurry and don't know why 
Oh, I hear a voice 
That says I'm running behind 
Better pick up my pace 
It's a race and there ain't no room for someone in second place 
I'm in a hurry to get things done 
Oh I rush and rush until life's no fun 
All I really gotta do is live and die B
ut I'm in a hurry and don't know why
