<song artist="Florida_Georgia_Line" title="Angel">
I know you love a little late night
Just me and you glowing with the brake light
Silhouettes sipping with a halo
Anything you want, girl, just say so
A little whisper off your lips, yeah
Said you're ready for the moonlight mix, yeah
I keep you spinning 'til you get your fix
'Til the sky gets lit, 'til the sunlight hits, yeah
I've been given a piece of heaven
Yeah, you're my angel, you're my angel tonight
Did it hurt when you fell from the sky?
Pretty girl, I'm gonna make you fly
See I was burning but you saved my life
My angel, you're my angel tonight
Yeah, I'm never gonna let you down (I got you, baby)
I just gotta tell you now ('cause my heart can't wait, girl)
You're my angel, you're my angel tonight
And do you thing, baby, 'cause it's so hot
There it is, yeah, that's the sweet spot
Blow your smoke, I'm gonna breathe it in, girl
Maybe it's a sin but, baby, bring it back again, yeah
I've been given a piece of heaven
Yeah, you're my angel, you're my angel tonight
Did it hurt when you fell from the sky?
Pretty girl, I'm gonna make you fly
See I was burning but you saved my life
My angel, you're my angel tonight
Yeah, I'm never gonna let you down (I got you, baby)
I just gotta tell you now ('cause my heart can't wait, girl)
You're my angel, you're my angel tonight
A little whisper off your lips, yeah
Said you're ready for the moonlight mix, yeah
I keep you spinning 'til you get your fix
'Til the sky gets lit, 'til the sunlight hits, yeah
I've been given a piece of heaven
Yeah, you're my angel, you're my angel tonight
Did it hurt when you fell from the sky?
Pretty girl, I'm gonna make you fly
See I was burning but you saved my life
My angel, you're my angel tonight
Yeah, I'm never gonna let you down (I got you, baby)
I just gotta tell you now ('cause my heart can't wait, girl)
You're my angel, you're my angel tonight
Yeah, I'm never gonna let you down (I got you, baby)
I just gotta tell you now ('cause my heart can't wait, girl)
You're my angel, you're my angel tonight
