Daddy thinks his brown eyed girl is an angel
She's got a wild side but covers it up so well..
She knows how to party, gets a little naughty
Spent a couple nights in jail
And it really turns her on when I let her get behind the wheel..
We go deep down in the woods
Make a little love on the truck hood
And she might be the one to turn a church boy into the devils son
And.. I'm ready, she's ready..feelin' like a dream but you know I'm really livin'
This could be the death of me..she's a backwoods beauty queen!
She's gotta look that'll kill and legs that should be a crime
She's a six pack girl you can throw away a bottle of wine
She's got holes in her clothes cuz anything goes when she's ridin' in my fourwheel drive
And this small town's dead but she's never felt more alive!
We go deep down in the woods
Make a little love on the truck hood
And she might be the one to turn a church boy into the devils son
And.. I'm ready, she's ready..feelin' like a dream but you know I'm really livin'
This could be the death of me..she's a backwoods beauty queen!
All of the fellas..they stay jealous
When I call her mine, oh mine...
This girl is one of a kind...ain't afraid to have a hell of a time
I ain't sayin' she ain't gotta good side
But I'm prayin' I don't see it tonight yeaah!!
We go deep down in the woods
Make a little love on the truck hood
And she might be the one to turn a church boy into the devils son
And.. I'm ready, she's ready..feelin' like a dream but you know I'm really livin'
This could be the death of me...woah yeah this girl has got the best of me!...
This could be the death of me...she's a backwoods beauty queen!
Backwoods beauty queen!
