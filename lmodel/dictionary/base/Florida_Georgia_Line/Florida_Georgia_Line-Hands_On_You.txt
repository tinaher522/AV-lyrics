<song artist="Florida_Georgia_Line" title="Hands_On_You">
When I get my hands on you, 
I'm gonna do every little everything, anything girl
that you want me to, when it's finally just you and me,
We'll let tonight turn tomorrow back into the night,
I'm gonna make you go crazy baby,
when I get my hands on you, 
ain't nothin' in the world gonna slow me down
I've been waitin' on this for such a long, long time
I've been waitin' on a chance girl to make you mine
Your body's burnin' me, turnin' me inside out,
I want you so bad, all that I can think about
When I get my hands on you,
I'm gonna do every little everything, anything girl
that you want me to, when it's finally just you and me,
We'll let tonight turn tomorrow back into the night,
I'm gonna make you go crazy baby,
When I get my hands on you, 
when I get my hands on you, yeah
We've been dancin' around this for way to long,
Now I don't care if it's right or wrong,
Just say the word and we're gonna be on our way,
You're like a work of art, baby and I can't wait
When I get my hands on you,
I'm gonna do every little everything, anything girl
that you want me to, when it's finally just you and me,
We'll let tonight turn tomorrow back into the night,
I'm gonna make you go crazy baby,
When I get my hands on you, 
I'm gonna hold you close, never let go, 
just the way that you want me to, 
yeah, cause it's all about you and me
We'll let tonight turn tomorrow back into the night,
gonna make you go crazy, baby
when I get my hands on you, 
When I get my hands on you, yeah
If I get my hands on you, girl
When I get my hands on you
