<song artist="Florida_Georgia_Line" title="Party_People">
Hey hey hey hey
Where my party people
Oh oh oh oh
Put the stereo on the roof and crank the JBLs
(Give me something with a backbeat
With country in the rap beat
And twist it on up to 10)
And if the Neighbors disapprove
Well they can go to Helena, Montana
(Or you can grab a case of beer and baby come on in)
We'll be spinnin' 'til the streetlights
Lookin' like a strobe light
'Til we're feelin' alright
Gonna do it all night
Hey hey hey hey
Where my party people
Oh oh oh oh
Monday's so far away
All my party people
Oh let's go
Well come on
Yeah we're gonna rock rock
Do a lotta shot shots
Someone tell the clock clock
We ain't gonna stop stop
Hey hey hey hey
Where my party people
Oh oh oh oh
Call your ten best lookin' friends
Tell them to call ten more
(I got enough yard for all y'all to park, just bring your own cup for the keg) 
Tell 'em look for the disco ball
Spinnin' 'round on my porch
(We'll be poppin' off tops in the hot tub truck bed, make a few waves, that's enough said)
Gonna get buck wild
Get a little buzz on
David Lee Roth style
Might as well jump jump
Hey hey hey hey
Where my party people
Oh oh oh oh
Monday's so far away
All my party people
Oh let's go
Well come on
Yeah we're gonna rock rock
Do a lotta shot shots
Someone tell the clock clock
We ain't gonna stop stop
Hey hey hey hey
Where my party people
Oh oh oh oh
Yeah we've been workin'
Let's make the weekend worth it
Party 'til it's hurtin'
Then we'll do it some more
Hey hey hey hey
Where my party people
Oh oh oh oh
Don't you know that Monday's so far away
All my party people
Oh let's go
Well come on
Yeah we're gonna rock rock
Do a lotta shot shots
Someone tell the clock clock
We ain't gonna stop stop
Hey hey hey hey
Where my party people
Oh let's go
Don't you know that Monday's so far away
All my party people
Oh let's go
Well come on
Yeah we're gonna rock rock
Do a lotta shot shots
Someone tell the clock clock
We ain't gonna stop stop
