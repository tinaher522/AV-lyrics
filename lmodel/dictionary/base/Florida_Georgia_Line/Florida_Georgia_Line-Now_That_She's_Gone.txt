<song artist="Florida_Georgia_Line" title="Now_That_She's_Gone">
Well she always had a way of getting her way
We could never work out if I wasn't willing to change
It was always my hair, my clothes, my hat
She hated my job, my dog, my dad
Even the way that I said grace
I couldn't be me for so long
I feel free now that she's gone
Gonna grow my hair out and buy a Harley
Get that tattoo I always wanted
Take off working night shift for a couple weeks
Live my life with a simple mission "have more fun, do a lot more fishing"
Hang out with my boys cause it's been too long
I'm gonna do whatever I want now that she's gone
Now I can see why I'm not the man she wanted me to be
How could I believe all the lines she fed to me
It was always eat this and don't drink that
Who are you with, where the hell are you at
You better be home by 9:15
I couldn't be me for so long
But I feel free now that she's gone
Gonna grow my hair out and buy a Harley
Get that tattoo I always wanted
Take off working night shift for a couple weeks
Gonna live my life with a simple mission "have more fun, do a lot more fishing"
Hang out with my boys cause it's been too long
I'm gonna do whatever I want now that she's gone
No more late night chick flicks
Spending all of my money just to earn a kiss
Walk a mile to the mall for the perfect pair of jeans
Spending all the days kissing ass to her family
Yeah, yeah
I'm gonna grow my hair out and buy a Harley
Get that tattoo I've always wanted
Take off working night shift for a couple weeks
Live my life with a simple mission "have more fun, do a lot more fishing"
Hang out with my boys cause it's been too long
I'm gonna do whatever I want
I'm gonna do whatever I want, yeah
I'm gonna do whatever I want now that she's gone
Now that she's gone
Woo oh oh oh
