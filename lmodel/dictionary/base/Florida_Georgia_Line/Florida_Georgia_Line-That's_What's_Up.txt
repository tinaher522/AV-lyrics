<song artist="Florida_Georgia_Line" title="That's_What's_Up">
When the sun comes up
We party down
We got that music way up loud
And all the girls
Hanging out of the truck
Singing hey, that's what's up
A little bit of Southern on the rocks
A little bit of Skynyrd on the box
A little bit of running from the cops
A pretty thing in a tank top
Flashing red lights, run on through it
Find the city limits sign and lose it
Baby you a song, so sing along to it
'Cause you know how we do
When the sun comes up
We party down
We got that music way up loud
And all the girls
Hanging out of the truck
Singing hey, that's what's up
We twist that top, pass it around
You know we burn it to the ground
All the boys got their 
Good years covered in mud
That's what's up
Baby nothin' going downtown
Tell you what
Yeah, that's what's up
That's what's up, man
That's what's up
Yeah, that's what's up
That's what's up, man
That's what's up
Come on
Well let me tell you 'bout my town
This field of dreams
I'm hooked as my Nicotine, uh
Holds me together like the seams on my jeans
And damn I can't leave, no I'm never gonna leave
It's even better than Alabama's Greatest Hits
A little mixtape you can jam along with
My kin, my friends, that's a long list
The water towers got all our names carved in
When the sun comes up
We party down
We got that music way up loud
And all the girls
Hanging out of the truck
Singing hey, that's what's up
We twist that top, pass it around
You know we burn it to the ground
All the boys got their 
Good years covered in mud
That's what's up
Baby nothin' going downtown
Tell you what
Yeah, that's what's up
That's what's up, man
That's what's up
Yeah, that's what's up
That's what's up, man
That's what's up
Aw yeah, talk to em BK
What's up
Baby, if you came to dance
You better your boots skinned
If you came to drink
Don't sip it just shoot it
If you came to sing
To the one you love
Get your lighters up
Baby that's what's up
If you need to boom
You know we brought the beat box
And if you need to rise
We about to blow the damn roof off
We got small town pride
Getting way too loud
'Cause it's in our blood
Baby that's what's up
Come on
When the sun comes up
We party down
We got that music way up loud
And all the girls
Hanging out of the truck
Singing hey, that's what's up
We twist that top, pass it around
You know we burn it to the ground
All the boys got their 
Good years covered in mud
That's what's up
Baby nothin' going downtown
I'll tell you what
Yeah, that's what's up
That's what's up, man
That's what's up
Yeah, that's what's up
That's what's up, man
That's what's up
Yeah, come on
