<song artist="Florida_Georgia_Line" title="Here's_To_The_Good_Times">
Let’s turn it up loud, mix it up strong 
Lean it back slow, get your feel good on 
Cut ’em off short, roll it up tight
Let it unwind tonight
Drop down the top down on the Pontiac
Where ever you wind up is where the party’s at 
Break out the bottle of Bacardi black
And don’t look back ’cause
Here’s to the good times, here’s to the sunshine 
Here’s to the ice you float your beer in
To the tops you pop and the tan lines disappearin’ 
Oh my, my
She’s a little bit tipsy
Leans in for a kiss, she’s stealin’ your heart just like a gypsy 
And there you are just a drunken star, just fallin’ in her eyes 
Here’s to the good times, while there’s still time
Well lay it all out, spray it on sweet 
Carve it in oak and permanent ink 
Park it way back, fog it on up 
Singin’ ohh, ohh
Radio spillin’ from a single cab
She looks so good with her silver tabs
Hangin’ on a branch by the river
That’s a memory that’ll get you when you look back
Here’s to the good times, here’s to the sunshine 
Here’s to the ice you float your beer in
To the tops you pop and the tan lines disappearin’ 
Oh my, my
She’s a little bit tipsy
Leans in for a kiss, she’s stealin’ your heart just like a gypsy 
And there you are just a drunken star, just fallin’ in her eyes 
Here’s to the good times, while there’s still time
Drop down the top down on the Pontiac
Where ever you wind up is where the party’s at 
Break out the bottle of Bacardi black
And don’t look back ’cause
Here’s to the good times, here’s to the sunshine 
Here’s to the ice you float your beer in
To the tops you pop and the tan lines disappearin’ 
Oh my, my
She’s a little bit tipsy
Leans in for a kiss, she’s stealin’ your heart just like a gypsy 
And there you are just a drunken star, just fallin’ in her eyes 
Here’s to the good times
Here’s to the good times and the moonshine 
And the blue eyes under the moonlight 
Here’s to the good times
