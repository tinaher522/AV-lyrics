<song artist="Florida_Georgia_Line" title="Tip_It_Back">
When you got a rockin' chair on your front porch
Tip it back
When you got a Georgia Bulldog ball cap
Tip it back
When you're parked back off a dirt road in your girlfriend's Cadillac
Find that button on the front seat
and Tip it back.
Aw yeah
Yeah, if you had a long day or a long week
Grab a longneck if you're with me
Come on now, holler "Hell yeah"
Cause tonight we're here to party
And don't worry about anything except what's in your glass
Whether it's a cold beer, tequila, or a double shot of Jack
Yeah, all you need to do tonight is tip it back
Tell 'em bout it PK
When that bar keep brings you change just
Tip it back
When you're two steppin' with your baby, man
Tip her back
When you don't get paid for next week but you need some drinkin' cash
Find that coffee can stash and
Tip it back.
Come on baby
If you had a long day or a long week
Grab a longneck if you're with me
Come on now, holler "Hell yeah"
Cause tonight we're here to party
And don't worry about anything except what's in your glass
Whether it's a cold beer, tequila, or a double shot of Jack
Yeah, all you need to do tonight is tip it back
Put that bottle to your lip, take a sip, man
Tip it back
Tie a cherry stem knot with your tongue, girl
Tip it back
If you like a pineapple coconut rum, baby
Tip it back
If you got a home grown moonshine flask, y'all
Tip it back
Come on
If you had a long day or a long week
Grab a longneck if you're with me
Come on now, holler "Hell yeah"
Cause tonight we're here to party
And don't worry about anything except what's in your glass
Whether it's a cold beer, tequila, or a double shot of Jack
Yeah, all you need to do tonight is tip it back
Yeah, all you need to do tonight is tip it back
Yeah, tip it back
Yeah, tip it back
Alright
