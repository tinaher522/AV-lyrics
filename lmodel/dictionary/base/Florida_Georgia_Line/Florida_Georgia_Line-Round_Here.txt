<song artist="Florida_Georgia_Line" title="Round_Here">
Hammerin' a nail
Stackin' them bales
I’m dog tired by the 5 o’clock hour
But I’m ready to raise some hell
And Jesse’s gettin' ready
I’m gassin' up the Chevy
I’m gonna pick her up at 6
I hope she’s gonna wear the jeans with a tear 
That her mama never fixed
The moon comes up and the sun goes down 
We find a little spot on the edge of town 
Twist off, sip a little, pass it around
Dance in the dust, turn the radio up
And that fireball whiskey whispers 
Temptation in my ear
It’s a feelin' alright Saturday night 
And that’s how we do it ’round here 
Yeah, that’s how we do it ’round here
Mud on the grips
Wild cherry on her lips
I've been workin' and tryin' and flirtin' and dyin' 
For an all night kinda kiss
And country on the boombox
And candles on the toolbox
Doin' everything right
Got the country boy charm
Turned all the way on tonight
The moon comes up and the sun goes down 
We find a little spot on the edge of town 
Twist off, sip a little, pass it around
Dance in the dust, turn the radio up
And that fireball whiskey whispers 
Temptation in my ear
It’s a feelin' alright Saturday night 
And that’s how we do it ’round here 
Yeah, that’s how we do it ’round here
The moon comes up and the sun goes down 
We find a little spot on the edge of town 
Twist off, sip a little, pass it around
Dance in the dust, turn the radio up
And that fireball whiskey whispers 
Temptation in my ear
It’s a feelin' alright Saturday night 
And that’s how we do it ’round here 
Yeah, that’s how we do it ’round here
Yeah, that’s how we do it 'round here 
Yeah, that’s how we do it 'round here
