It's a kiss from Katie on the swing set
When I was in 3rd grade
Teacher makin' me sit from recess
when I would misbehave
It's a long haul to see my grandma
During the holidays
I can tell my mama loved Jesus
By the way she said grace
It's a spring break
For me and my buddies that had to go our own way
Sunday, that I got saved
It's a class ring, that we never bought 'cause we thought we'd win state
But it didn't turn out that way
I can't complain, it's how it became
The man I am today
It's a fast lane headed down the interstate, a long way from home
Loaded down with a truck full of memories
The only thing I've ever owned
It's a late night, bar fights comin' in
Getting pizza at 3 AM
Fallin' in and out of love with my girlfriend,
Asking God to forgive my sins again and again
It's the four years, everybody says you're supposed to find yourself and they were the best
There's the lonely tears that I cried that night when I saw my dad die
But I know he's in a better place
So I can't complain, it's how I became
The man I am today
'Cause the good Lord always seems to have a funny way
Of makin' you look back on your life and say
It's the white dress, walking down the isle the day I said I do
Watchin' our boy take his first breath
It's the true love, that made it through the years and started on a swing set, I know that I am truly blessed
So I can't complain, Wouldn't change a thing, it's how I became
The man I am today
The man I am today
It's a kiss from Katie on the swing set, when I was in 3rd grade
