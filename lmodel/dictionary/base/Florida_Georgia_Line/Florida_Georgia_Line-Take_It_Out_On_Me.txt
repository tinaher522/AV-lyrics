<song artist="Florida_Georgia_Line" title="Take_It_Out_On_Me">
What'd he do this time? 
Did he break your heart? 
I can tell you been crying...and baby here you are.
And I always know any time you show up at my door past 11 o'clock that he really must've pissed you off. 
Take it out on me.
Put your lips on mine. 
Let me take his wrong and make it right this time. 
Yeah, you can just come over, you ain't gotta call. 
You always got a shoulder anytime it all goes bad, when you're 'bout to break, when you're mad as hell, you can always take it out on me.
You can take it out on me baby. 
If you ever wanna leave, baby. 
In the middle of the night, that's alright...
You can take, take..
Take off your coat, baby come on in. 
Girl, let me help to get back at him. 
And I don't know why you never say goodbye... 
Whatever hell he's puttin' you through, 
I can't wait for you to take it out on me.
Put your lips on mine. 
Let me take his wrong and make it right this time. 
Yeah, you can just come over, you ain't gotta call. 
You always got a shoulder anytime it all goes bad, when you're 'bout to break, when you're mad as hell, you can always take it out on me.
Yeah, I'll lay you down and love you just the way you should be. 
Baby, so now that you're ready..
Take it out on me. 
You can take it out on me baby. 
If you ever wanna leave, baby. 
In the middle of the night, that's alright...
You can take, take, take it out on me.
Put your lips on mine. 
Let me take his wrong and make it right this time. 
Yeah, you can just come over, you ain't gotta call. 
You always got a shoulder anytime it all goes bad, when you're 'bout to break, when you're mad as hell, you can always take it out on me.
You can take it out on me baby. 
If you ever wanna leave, baby. 
In the middle of the night, that's alright...
You can take, take, take it out on me.
