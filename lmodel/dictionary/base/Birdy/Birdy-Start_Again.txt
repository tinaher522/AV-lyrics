<song artist="Birdy" title="Start_Again">
Tidal wave, tidal wave
Take it all, take it all
And I don't care anymore
And you can lie all you like
All it's done is make me fight
And shake the truth inside my soul
I'm tired pretending
Keep my beliefs suspending
'Cause underneath
I'm starting to wake from silent sleep
I'm starting to break and I can grieve
I'm starting to see that I know how
To love, to lose, to work it out
I'm starting to heal and find some faith
I'm starting to feel what's out of place
Don't need you to save me, I can't wait
To fall, to fail and start again
Hurricane, hurricane
Take it all, take it all
Swing me round and back again
And you can talk, you can talk
All it's done is start a war
With nothing really to defend
I'm tired pretending
Keep my beliefs suspending
'Cause underneath
I'm starting to wake from silent sleep
I'm starting to break and I can grieve
I'm starting to see that I know how
To love, to lose, to work it out
I'm starting to heal and find some faith
I'm starting to feel what's out of place
Don't need you to save me, I can't wait
To fall, to fail and start again
Hey, hey
To start again
Hey, hey
To start again
I'm starting to wake from silent sleep
I'm starting to break and I can grieve
I'm starting to see that I know how
To love, to lose, to work it out
I'm starting to heal and find some faith
I'm starting to feel what's out of place
Don't need you to save me, I can't wait
To fall, to fail and start again
