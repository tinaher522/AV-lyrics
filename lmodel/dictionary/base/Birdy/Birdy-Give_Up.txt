<song artist="Birdy" title="Give_Up">
I find myself in these four walls
Wishing for somewhere else
I've lost myself like this before
Calling out for your help
All the times I won't believe
Yours will be the voice that is on my shoulder
All the things you've said to me
Written on my heart every word you've spoken
I know you, you'll never give up on me, give up on me
If I would I'd let you give up on me, give up on me
Oh, when I'm out of place and I'm losing faith
You're the one that never lets me run
You'll never give up on me, give up on me, give up on me
Inside my head I've been at war
Trying to find some peace
If you can't see an open door
Teach me how to be free
All the times I won't believe
Yours will be the voice that is on my shoulder
All the things you've said to me
Written on my heart every word you've spoken
I know you, you'll never give up on me, give up on me
If I would I'd let you give up on me, give up on me
Oh, when I'm out of place and I'm losing faith
You're the one that never lets me run
You'll never give up on me, give up on me, give up on me
'Til you get here I'll be holding on, holding on
You always know the words to make me strong, make me strong
I know you, you'll never give up on me, give up on me
If I would I'd let you give up on me, give up on me
Oh, when I'm out of place, when I'm losing faith
You're the one that never lets me run
You'll never give up on me, give up on me, give up on me
I know you, you'll never give up on me, give up on me
If I would I'd let you give up on me, give up on me
Oh, when I'm out of place and I'm losing faith
You're the one that never lets me run
You'll never give up on me, give up on me, give up on me
