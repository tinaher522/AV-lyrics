<song artist="Birdy" title="Standing_In_The_Way_Of_Light">
Through the driving rain
I have lost the words
To piece us back together
To tell you how it hurts
Cause lately we've been breaking
All we've built so far
And I'm tired of sitting waiting
Alone in the dark
There's still a way to make it right
We'll find the strength this time
And pull back this veil
Turn night into day
Don't you know you're standing in the way of the light?
Pour oil on these flames
Speed up my heart again
Don't you know you're standing in the way of the light?
Round we go in circles
Does it have to be this hard?
We can stop the fighting
If you let down your guard
There's still a way to make it right
We'll find the strength this time
And pull back this veil
Turn night into day
Don't you know you're standing in the way of the light?
Pour oil on these flames
Speed up my heart again
Don't you know you're standing in the way of the light?
So come on, come on, come on
We've been living in the shadows too long
So come on, come on, come on
Just pull back this veil
Turn night into day
Don't you know you're standing in the way of the light?
Pour oil on these flames
Speed up my heart again
Don't you know you're standing in the way of the light?
(Come on, come on, come on...)
Pull back this veil
Turn night into day
Don't you know you're standing in the way of the light?
Pour oil on these flames
Speed up my heart again
Don't you know you're standing in the way of the light?
You're standing in the way of the light
