<song artist="Birdy" title="Winter">
It's so cold, baby, it's dark outside
Winter cold's creeping in through the night
And it's so hard when I just wanna hold you tight
Breaks my heart, but nothing can break this ice
Hold on, hold on, baby, just be strong
And I will be honest and let you go
This is the reason and you should know
Through all that you promise, I can see
None of your dreams ever have time for me
So this is the reason I let you go
And I will be honest and you should know
Through all that you promise, I can see
None of your dreams ever have time for me
And it's so quiet, baby, it's hard to breathe
Black as ink, the silence is deafening
And it's so hard to look into distant eyes
And feel your heart slowly die away from mine
So long, so long, baby, you're long gone
And I will be honest and let you go
This is the reason and you should know
Through all that you promise, I can see
None of your dreams ever have time for me
So this is the reason I let you go
I will be honest and you should know
Through all that you promise, I can see
None of your dreams ever have time for me
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
In none of your dreams, take me with you
None of your dreams, let me love you
None of your dreams, take me with you
Take me with you, ey ey ey ey
None of your dreams, take me with you
None of your dreams, let me love you
None of your dreams, take me with you
Take me with you, ey ey ey ey
None of your dreams, take me with you
None of your dreams, let me love you
None of your dreams, take me with you
Take me with you, ey ey ey ey
None of your dreams, take me with you
None of your dreams, let me love you
None of your dreams, take me with you
Take me with you, ey ey ey ey
None of your dreams, take me with you
None of your dreams, let me love you
None of your dreams, take me with you
Take me with you
None of your dreams, take me with you
Ooh ooh ooh
