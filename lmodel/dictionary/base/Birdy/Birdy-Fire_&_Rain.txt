<song artist="Birdy" title="Fire_&_Rain">
Just yesterday morning, they let me know that you were gone
Susanne, the plans they made put an end to you
I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song
I just can't remember who to send it to
Well, I've seen the fire and I've seen the rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
Seen lonely times, when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again
Won't you look down upon me, Jesus?
You've got to help me make a stand
You've just got to see me through another day
My body's aching and my time is at hand
And I won't make it any other way
Well, I've seen the fire and I've seen the rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
Seen lonely times, when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again
I've been walking my mind to an easy time
With my back turned towards the sun
Lord knows when the cold wind blows
It'll turn your head around
Well, there's hours of time on the telephone line
To talk about things to come
Sweet dreams and flying machines
In pieces on the ground
Well, I've seen the fire and I've seen the rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
Seen lonely times, when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again
Guess I always thought that I'd see you again
