<song artist="Birdy" title="Beating_Heart">
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
There's a beating in your heart
That takes you everywhere
Take you anywhere
You've been reaching in the dark
Like there's no one there
You think there's no one there
You've been trying too hard trying to start
It takes time, don't lose yourself
Don't keep fighting your heart, stay as you are
Don't change for anyone else
Say it strong, lay it all on me
You don't have to be afraid 
Of what you think you're not, you'll see
Say it wrong, let the words run free
I know what you mean
And you'll find someone who loves you just as much as me
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
There's a beating in your heart
That takes you everywhere
Take you anywhere
You're afraid of coming last
You see it everywhere
You think you'll never get there
You've been trying too hard trying to start
It takes time, don't lose yourself
Don't keep fighting your heart, stay as you are
Don't change for anyone else
Say it strong, lay it all on me
You don't have to be afraid 
Of what you think you're not, you'll see
Say it wrong, let the words run free
I know what you mean
And you'll find someone who loves you just as much as me
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Lay your head on my knees
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
You can confide in me
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Close your eyes and be free
Say it strong, lay it all on me
You don't have to be afraid 
Of what you think you're not, you'll see
Say it wrong, let the words run free
I know what you mean
And you'll find someone who loves you just as much as me
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
