<song artist="Birdy" title="The_Same">
I've tried to be fair
And pretend like I care
But no asset is worth all the time
Spent listening and laughing
To dramas that mean nothing
Can't find any depth to these minds
Purity lost in vain
And you think I should be the same?
Don't assume I will follow
And drop all my morals
So you can look good for the crowd
You don't care about my thoughts
Just the light that I brought
I'm tired of helping you out
They chose to be blind
When lonely and shy
I searched for acceptance at first
Said the traits didn't match
Now you take it all back
When it adds something more to your worth
Purity lost in vain
And you think I should be the same?
Don't assume I will follow
And drop all my morals
So you can look good for the crowd
You don't care about my thoughts
Just the light that I brought
I'm tired of helping you out
All this time you chose never to care
But now you won't leave me alone
Like we've always been close
I'm telling you nothing has changed
Purity lost in vain
And you think I should be the same?
Don't assume I will follow
And drop all my morals
So you can look good for the crowd
You don't care about my thoughts
Just the light that I brought
I'm tired of helping you out
You think I should be the same
