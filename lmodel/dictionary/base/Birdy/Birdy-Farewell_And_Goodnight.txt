<song artist="Birdy" title="Farewell_And_Goodnight">
Goodnight to every little hour that you sleep tight
May it hold you through the winter of a long night
And keep you from the loneliness of yourself
Heart strung, is your heart frayed and empty
'Cause it's hard luck when no one understands your love
It's unsung and I say
Goodnight, my love, to every hour in every day
Goodnight, always, to all that's pure that's in your heart
</song>
