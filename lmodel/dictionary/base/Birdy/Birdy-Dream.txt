<song artist="Birdy" title="Dream">
Breathe
I'm listening close to every word that you speak
Don't try to blame the things that bring you down, just see
I'm on your side and counting down the days to be
Right beside you when you sleep and when you dream
Dream…
Leave
All of your rage behind and realize it's me
Hold on before I'm gone 'cause one day we will need
Someone to understand the things that make us free
Free…
