Home
Reflections of eyes shine bright and my mind remind me 
I long
To be cold and feel alive for that's what inspires me
Home
To be free, just to breathe, only seen in the eyes that know me
Home
Like a dream out of reach I can't see through the film that clouds it
Memories fade to dust
Slowly losing touch
To belong is the feeling I want
Is it wrong to miss the time that we had?
Now it's gone
Didn't plan for this
Home is where my heart is
It's the feeling I want
Is it wrong to miss the time that we had?
Now it's gone
Didn't plan for this
Home is where my heart is
Home
Used to wish to be gone, to be far from the ones who choke me
Now
All I want is to hear, to be near to the walls around me
Memories fade to grey
Take me to the place
Where I belong is the feeling I want
Is it wrong to miss the time that we had?
Now it's gone
Didn't plan for this
Home is where my heart is
It's the feeling I want
Is it wrong to miss the time that we had?
Now it's gone
Didn't plan for this
Home is where my heart is
I'm grateful for the chance that it's mine
So I'll cherish every second of time
To belong is the feeling I want
Is it wrong to miss the time that we had?
Now it's gone
Didn't plan for this
Home is where my heart is
It's the feeling I want
Is it wrong to miss the time that we had?
Now it's gone
Didn't plan for this
Home is where my heart is
Didn't plan for this
Home is where my heart is
