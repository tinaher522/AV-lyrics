<song artist="Birdy" title="What_You_Want">
What you want to say
Wait 'til you get home
I'm sick of communicating 
over the telephone
Tell me how you feel
For I am lonely too
Need you to know
I'm just as cold and numb as you.
But I could fly away
Or I could be no one
And you could be the
Sunshine falling over the mountain
You could come to stay
You could come right home
I don't see why I have to
Live this life all alone
I know there is a way 
to make up for mistakes
I know what's happening is for a reason
I know...
But I could fly away
Or I could be no one
Sunshine falling 
over the mountain
