<song artist="Kiesza" title="Prayer_In_C">
Yeah, you never said a word
You didn't send me no letter
Don't think I could forgive you
See our world is slowly dying
And I'm not wasting no more time
Don't think I could believe you
Yeah, you never said a word
You didn't send me no letter
Don't think I could forgive you
See our world is slowly dying
I'm not wasting no more time
Don't think I could believe you
Yeah, our hands will get more wrinkled
And our hair will be more grey
Don't think I could forgive you
And see the children they are starving
And their houses were destroyed
Don't think they will forgive you
Hey, when seas will cover lands
And when men will be no more
Don't think you can forgive you
Yeah when there'll just be silence
And when life will be over
Don't think you will forgive you
Don't think you will forgive you
Don't think you will forgive you
Don't think you will forgive you
Don't think I will forgive you
Yeah, you never said a word
You didn't send me no letter
Don't think I could forgive you
See our world is slowly dying
And I'm wasting no more time
Don't think I could believe you
