<song artist="Kiesza" title="The_Love">
This is the love
Something you can feel but you can't define
Can't get enough
And I don't wanna leave what we can't rewind
This is the love
Something you can feel but you can't define
Can't get enough
And I don't wanna leave what we can't rewind
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Baby, baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Baby, baby
I'm so close
You take me far away
I don't go
We'll get to feel this love again
Don't vice clothes
You make my heart away
I just know that you're one hell of a love
Shouting from the ceiling
Candy calling
This is the love
Something you can feel but you can't define
Can't get enough
And I don't wanna leave what we can't rewind
This is the love
Something you can feel but you can't define
Can't get enough
And I don't wanna leave what we can't rewind
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Baby, baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Baby, baby
I don't wanna waste another day
Of my choice, don't think I'll ever wanna land
I feel you in every single way
I just know that you're one hell of a love
Shouting from the ceiling
Candy calling
Oh when you're holding me
I feel something, and it feels so good
Oh when you're holding me
You give me something no one ever could
Oh when you're holding me
You give me something that it feels so good
Oh when you're holding me
You give me something no one ever could
This is the love
Something you can feel but you can't define
Can't get enough
And I don't wanna leave what we can't rewind
This is the love
Something you can feel but you can't define
Can't get enough
And I don't wanna leave what we can't rewind
