Hold me
This is why I'm giving
This is why I'm giving
This is why I'm giving
Hold me
This is why I'm giving
This is why I'm giving
This is why I'm giving
I'm under your fire
You got me burning up inside yeah
You use my desire
Against me how could I deny it?
You consume me with your love attacks boy
Blow my pride away, it's not about it
I should be running but I can't hold back boy
Filling up my emotions
You're still giving up to me
I'm giving up to you
Cause I can't use my lonely heart against you
These feelings that I bleed
They're finally to lose
But if it must be warned I'm falling for you
Hold me
This is why I'm giving
This is why I'm giving
This is why I'm giving
Hold me
This is why I'm giving
This is why I'm giving
This is why I'm giving
You left me defenseless
Explosions going off inside yeah
No shiver my senses
My gorgeous case when we collide
You consume me with your love attacks boy
Blow my pride away, it's not about it
I should be running but I can't hold back boy
Filling up my emotions
You're still giving up to me
I'm giving up to you
Cause I can't use my lonely heart against you
These feelings that I bleed
They're finally to lose
But if it must be warned I'm falling for you
Hold me
This is why I'm giving
This is why I'm giving
This is why I'm giving
Hold me
This is why I'm giving
This is why I'm giving
This is why I'm giving
You know my weakness always has been you
There's no sh*t that I can use
Losing control has never felt so good
Eyes surround me and you
You're still giving up to me
I'm giving up to you
Cause I can't use my lonely heart against you
These feelings that I bleed
They're finally to lose
But if it must be warned I'm falling for you
Hold me
This is why I'm giving
This is why I'm giving
This is why I'm giving
Hold me
This is why I'm giving
This is why I'm giving
This is why I'm giving
