<song artist="Kiesza" title="Hideaway">
Taking me higher than I've ever been before
I'm holding it back, just wanna shout out "give me more"
You're just a hideaway, you're just a feeling
You let my heart escape beyond the meaning
Not even I can find a way to stop the storm
Oh, baby, it's out of my control what's going on
But you're just a chance I take to keep on dreaming
You're just another day that keeps me breathing
Baby, I love the way that there's nothing sure
Baby, don't stop me, hide away with me some more
You're sending a shiver up my spine, might overflow
You're bringing me closer to the edge of letting go
Oh, but you're just a hideaway, you're just a feeling
You let my heart escape beyond the meaning
Pulling my head into the clouds, I'm floating up
When you get me going, I can't find a way to stop
Oh, but you're just a chance I take to keep on dreaming
You're just another day that keeps me breathing
Baby, I love the way that there's nothing sure
Baby, don't stop me, hide away with me some more
Hide away with me some more
Taking me higher than I've ever been before
I'm holding it back, just wanna shout out "give me more"
But you're just a hideaway, you're just a feeling
You let my heart escape beyond the meaning
Not even I can find a way to stop the storm
Oh, baby, it's out of my control what's going on
But you're just a chance I take to keep on dreaming
You're just another day that keeps me breathing
Oh, yeah, you're the day that keeps me breathing
Baby, I love the way that there's nothing sure
Baby, don't stop me, hide away with me some more
Oh, oh, hide away with me some more
