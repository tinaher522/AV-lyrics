<song artist="Kiesza" title="Piano">
I still remember you
Hug me like a picture frame
While I'm staring in your eyes
My mind's still in the memory
Turfed like I'm a bulletproof
My heart's playing halo games
Knowing that when you and I collide
I'll give you everything
When I try to run away you make me think of fight back
And I don't think that I've ever had a feeling like that
Oh your love is not fiction
It's the realest I've seen
But you don't even know what you're doing to me, yeah
You, you
Don't know you're setting off a fuse, fuse
You make me wanna break the rules
Come put your hands on my piano
You, you
No you ain't got nothing to prove, prove
You got me breaking all the rules, rules
So put your hands on my piano
Who said I wanna lose
Subtle how you say my name
Acting like I'm in control
I fall, you're taking over me
Lost baby here's the truth
I'm blind folded in your maze
Bodies going in the dark, and art, it's all that I ever need
When I try to run away you make me think of fight back
And I don't think that I've ever had a feeling like that
Oh your love is not fiction
It's the realest I've seen
But you don't even know what you're doing to me, yeah
You, you
Don't know you're setting off a fuse, fuse
You make me wanna break the rules
Come put your hands on my piano
You, you
No you ain't got nothing to prove, prove
You got me breaking all the rules, rules
So put your hands on my piano
Looking for a way but I can't go
Cause babe I even see you with my eyes closed
Babe I even see you with my eyes closed
Looking for a reason but I got none
Cause secretly I don't think that I want one
Honestly I don't think that I want one
Yeah, yeah
Don't know what you do to
You, you
Don't know you're setting off a fuse, fuse
You make me wanna break the rules
Come put your hands on my piano
You, you
No you ain't got nothing to prove, prove
You got me breaking all the rules, rules
So put your hands on my piano
You, you
Don't know you're setting off a fuse, fuse
You make me wanna break the rules
Come put your hands on my piano
You, you
No you ain't got nothing to prove, prove
You got me breaking all the rules, rules
So put your hands on my piano
