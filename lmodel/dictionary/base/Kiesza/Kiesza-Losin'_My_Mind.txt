<song artist="Kiesza" title="Losin'_My_Mind">
Kiesza (Mick Jenkins):
You got me losin' my mind
You got me losin' my mind, yeah yeah
I'm just a fool for your kind, yeah
You got me losin' my mind
(Uh huh, Uh huh
It's for the children)
Mmm Losin' my mind
Mmm Losin' my mind
Mmm Losin' my mind, oh
All this talk of eternity
Why not start at one single night
I know love's a reality
But I'll test drive your body tonight
All this heartache and fantasy
Only you have control of your heart
I admit when I'm next to you
I can feel myself fallin' apart
Kiesza (Mick Jenkins):
You got me losin' my mind (uh huh, uh huh)
You got me losin' my mind (uh huh, uh huh)
I'm just a fool for your kind (uh huh, uh huh)
You got me losin' my mind (uh huh, uh huh)
It's a beautiful misery
When you feel something too good to fight
I know some things are meant to be
I guess we'll know when we turn off the lights
All this fiction and fairytale
When we might as well cut to the chase
I won't quit till you're touchin' me
And your sending my body to grace
Kiesza (Mick Jenkins):
You got me losin' my mind (uh huh, uh huh)
You got me losin' my mind (uh huh, uh huh)
I'm just a fool for your kind (uh huh, uh huh)
You got me losin' my mind (uh huh, uh huh)
Mmm Losin' my mind
Mmm Losin' my mind
Mmm Losin' my mind, oh
Mmm Losin' my mind
Mmm Losin' my mind
Mmm Losin' my mind, oh
Mick Jenkins:
Drink more water
I never thought I would be here
Guess it's Dallas Texas to Lamar Odom
You play your cards and you never fold 'em, it's Texas Hold 'Em
I pray to God that he never say that I never know'd him
I took them hearts from extended hands but I never stole 'em
That's gotta be worth somethin'
Shake them fears lil' mama go and twerk somethin'
Nah, good music, incense in a candle
Join me for the joint and niggas intimately channel
She says she wasn't gon' do it, her intentions dismantled
I'm in that, be damned if I swim bad, I'm Sinbad
Check the flow, seven seas, worth the effort please
Don't get distracted by the usual selected keys
Kiesza (Mick Jenkins):
You got me losin' my mind (uh huh, uh huh)
You got me losin' my mind (uh huh, uh huh)
I'm just a fool for your kind (uh huh, uh huh)
You got me losin' my mind (uh huh, uh huh)
