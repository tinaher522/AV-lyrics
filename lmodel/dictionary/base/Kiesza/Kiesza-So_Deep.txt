<song artist="Kiesza" title="So_Deep">
Tell me why you want it 
​As you turn my body into shapes
​Lead me to your madness
​Keep bending my heart into deeper shapes
​Paint me with your body
​I wanna be the canvas underneath
​​Let me see your magic
​I feel you're taking over me
Baby I can never find relief
​I'm still loving you right now, right now, right now
​The feelings never leave
​I'm just loving you, right now, right now, right now
​Taking my love
Baby I'm so deep now
​Can't get out 
​Baby I'm so deep now
​Taking my love 
Baby I'm so deep now
​Can't get out
​Baby I'm so deep now
​Even in the darkness
​You can make a rapture of my pain
​Somehow you go beneath it
​And take my heart to a higher place
​Break me into pieces
​You can choose the colour of my fate
​Long as we can keep it
​You can have it all again
Baby I can never find relief
​I'm still loving you right now, right now, right now
​The feelings never leave
​I'm just loving you, right now, right now, right now
​Taking my love
Baby I'm so deep now
​Can't get out
​Baby I'm so deep now
​Taking my love 
​Baby I'm so deep now
​Can't get out
​Baby I'm so deep now
​I just wanna let my time
​Boy lose it with you yeah
​So won't you give it up to me
​Tell me why you want it
​As you turn my body into shapes
​Lead me to your madness
​Keep bending my heart into deeper shapes
​Paint me with your body
​I wanna be the canvas underneath
​​Let me see your magic
​I feel you're taking over me
Baby I can never find relief
​I'm still loving you right now, right now, right now
​The feelings never leave
​I'm just loving you, right now, right now, right now
​Taking my love baby I'm so deep now
