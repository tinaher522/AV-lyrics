<song artist="Kiesza" title="Over_Myself">
Stop now, don't take over me
My heart is burning up inside
And I felt it go up when your eyes
Told another lie, you never say it to me right, baby
This is my plea to you now
Something's going down, I thought it's always going right
Then changed my mind
This is my love, and I can give it up
I think I gotta break your heart to get over myself, yeah, yeah
I think I gotta break your heart to get over myself
I think I gotta break your heart to get over myself
Desire, always killing me
I feel it deep inside my bones, it's chilling my soul
I'm shattered, I can't find no peace
Still trying to find it into truth in your history
But I'm stronger than I was before
I finally broke it down the wall when you shut the door
This is my love, and I can give it up
I think I gotta break your heart to get over myself, yeah, yeah
I think I gotta break your heart to get over myself
I think I gotta break your heart to get over myself
Giving it back, I wanna watch you have fun
Giving it back, I'm sorry when I see the way you
Looking at me, I'm breaking in but now
I think I gotta break your heart to get over myself
Tripping your love but I just don't feel it
Don't know I want but I just don't need it
You're better off but you won't believe it
Over my, over my, over myself
Giving it back, I wanna watch you have fun
Giving it back, I'm sorry when I see the way you
Looking at me, I'm breaking in but now
I think I gotta break your heart to get over myself
Giving it back, I wanna watch you have fun
Giving it back, I'm sorry when I see the way you
Looking at me, I'm breaking in but now
I think I gotta break your heart to get over myself
