<song artist="Kiesza" title="Take_Me_To_Church">
My lover's got humour
He's the giggle at a funeral
Knows everybody's disapproval
I should've worshiped her sooner
If the Heavens ever did speak
He is the last true mouthpiece
Every Sunday's getting more bleak
A fresh poison each week
'You were born sick,' you heard them say it
My church offers no absolution
He told me, 'Worship in the bedroom'
The only heaven I'll be sent to
Is when I'm alone with you
We were born sick
But I love it
Command me to be well
Amen
Amen
Amen
Amen
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
If I'm a pagan of the good times
My lover's the sunlight
To keep this God on my side
He demands a sacrifice
To drain the whole sea
Get something shiny, yeah
Something meaty for the main course
That's a fine looking high horse
What you got in the stable?
That's a lot of starving faithful
That looks plenty
That looks tasty
This is hungry work
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
No masters or kings
When the ritual begins
There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin
In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
Only then I am human
Only then I am clean
Amen
Amen
Amen
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
