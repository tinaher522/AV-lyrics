<song artist="Kiesza" title="Cut_Me_Loose">
So this is what it is
I'm just another case
After this war of me
Now I can truly see
I should know when you came to me
I had eyes on the treasure I couldn't keep
Got so buried in love I can hardly breathe
Fed you all of my heart
And you swallowed me, now I'm starving
Stop wasting my time babe
No more changing your mind on me
Cut me loose
Do it for my sake
I'll be better on my own
I'm picking the silence
It's time that I do what's best for me
Cut me loose
And try to forget me
I'll be better on my own
On my own
I'll be better on my own
On my own
How did it all begin?
Baby I'm caving in
Nothing I know it's clear
Where do I go from here?
I should know when you came to me
I had eyes on the treasure I couldn't keep
Got so buried in love I can hardly breathe
Fed you all of my heart
And you swallowed me, now I'm starving
Stop wasting my time babe
No more changing your mind on me
Cut me loose
Do it for my sake
I'll be better on my own
I'm picking the silence
It's time that I do what's best for me
Cut me loose
And try to forget me
I'll be better on my own
On my own
Lie, low in
Giving my best not to fret as I go on
Cause I don't want even a breathe or a side
Just to hope I take nothing more, I got no more to waste
Moving forward, there's too much to face
But I know it's my only way
Stop wasting my time babe
No more changing your mind on me
Cut me loose
Do it for my sake
I'll be better on my own
I'm picking the silence
It's time that I do what's best for me
Cut me loose
And try to forget me
I'll be better on my own
On my own
