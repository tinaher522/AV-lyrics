<song artist="Kiesza" title="What_Is_Love">
Mmm... Ooh...
I don't know you're not there
I gave you my love, but you just don't care
Was I right, was I wrong?
Give me a sign
What is love?
Baby don't hurt me, don't hurt me, no more
What is love?
Baby don't hurt me, don't hurt me, no more
Ooh ooh...
I don't know, what can I do?
What can I say it's up to you
I know your right, just me and you
I can't go on
What is love?
Baby don't hurt me, don't hurt me, no more
What is love?
Baby don't hurt me, don't hurt me, no more, no more
Ooh, ooh... yeah...
Ooh, ooh, ooh... yeah
I want no other, no other lover
This is your life, but it's our time
But when we are together, I need you forever
Is this love?
What is love?
Baby don't hurt me, don't hurt me, no more
What is love?
Baby don't hurt me, baby don't hurt me, no more, no more
Don't hurt me, no more
Baby don't hurt me, no more... no more
