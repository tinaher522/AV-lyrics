<song artist="Kiesza" title="Sound_Of_A_Woman">
One more time
I stand by
While you choose to cross the line
I don't know why I try
Should have left it all behind
Can't go on, can't rewind
Something holds me deep inside
What's the point, love aside
I have no more tears to cry
Baby I don't need you
Especially not your lies
You never let my voice through
I wonder why I cry
Maybe that's the sound of a woman
Maybe that's the sound of the whole race
You're just crying out to the woman
Chained heart of love that you can't escape
You would understand if you listen
You would have fought your eyes on your story door
Maybe that's the sound of a woman
Begging you to try just a little more
One more time, I'll ask why
You let me waste all those nights
Had I known, I have now let you step into my life
We both know
That I tried not to leave it all behind
Even though I explain you still read between the lines
Baby I don't need you
Especially not your lies
You never let my voice through
I wonder why I cry
Maybe that's the sound of a woman
Maybe that's the sound of the whole race
You're just crying out to the woman
Chained heart of love that you can't escape
You would understand if you listen
You would have fought your eyes on your story door
Maybe that's the sound of a woman
Begging you to try just a little more
If you've ever been the best
Baby you should think of us
Every thing that you gave
While I run away on love
If I ever think of love
I will just remember what I went through when I gave on you
Maybe that's the sound of a woman
Maybe that's the sound of the whole race
You're just crying out to the woman
Chained heart of love that you can't escape
You would understand if you listen
You would have fought your eyes on your story door
Maybe that's the sound of a woman
Begging you to try just a little more
Just a little more
