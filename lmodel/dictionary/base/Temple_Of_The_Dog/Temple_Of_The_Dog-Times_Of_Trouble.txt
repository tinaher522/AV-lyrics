<song artist="Temple_Of_The_Dog" title="Times_Of_Trouble">
When the spoon is hot and the needle's sharp
And you drift away, ooh,  I can hear you say
That the world in black is upon your back
And your body shakes
So you ditch away, yeah, and you close the shades
Don't try to do it
Don't try to kill your time, oh
Yeah, you might do it
Then you can't change your mind, oh
You've got to hold on to your time
Till you break through these times of trouble
When you try to talk and the words get hard
And they put you down
Don't you stay
Don't ditch away
I saw you swinging
Yeah, swinging your mother's sword, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah,  I know you're playing
Oh, sometimes the rules get hard, oh
But if somebody left you out on a ledge
If somebody pushed you over the edge
You've got to hold on to your time
And break through these times of trouble
I saw you swinging
Yeah, swinging your mother's sword, ooh
And yeah, yeah, yeah,  I know you're playing
Oh, sometimes the rules get hard, oh
But if somebody left you out on a ledge
If somebody pushed you over the edge
If somebody loved you and left you for dead
You got to hold on to your time
And break through these times of trouble
