<song artist="Temple_Of_The_Dog" title="Call_Me_A_Dog">
You call me a dog, well that's fair enough
'Cause it ain't no use to pretend you're wrong
And you call me out, I can't hide anymore
I have no disguise you can't see through
You say it's bad luck to have fallen for me
What can I do to make it good for you?
You wore me out like an old winter coat
Trying to be safe from the cold
Oh, but it's my time to throw the next stone
I'll call you beautiful, if I call at all
Ooh, you call me a dog and you tell me I'm low
'Cause I slept on the floor
And out in the woods with the badgers and wolves
You threw me out 'cause I went digging for gold
And I came home with a handful of coal
Oh, but it's my time to throw the next stone
I'll call you beautiful, if I call at all
And when it's my time to call your bluff
I'll call you beautiful or leave it alone, yeah
You call me a dog, well that's fair enough
It doesn't bother me as long as you know
That bad luck will follow you
If you keep me on a leash and you drag me along, ooh
Oh, but it's my time to throw the next stone
I'll call you beautiful, if I call at all, yeah
And when it's my time to call your bluff, ooh
I'll call you beautiful or leave it alone, yeah
You call me a dog
