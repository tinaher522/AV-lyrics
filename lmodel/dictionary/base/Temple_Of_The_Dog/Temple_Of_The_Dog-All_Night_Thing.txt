She motioned to me
That she wanted to leave
And go somewhere warm
Where we'd be alone
I do not know
What's going on
But I'm guessing
Ooh, it's an all night thing
Yeah, it's an all night thing
If it's an all night thing
Nobody is gonna make it end
And if it don't begin
Don't worry that I'll take offense
If it's an all night thing
And we fall like a tear falling to the ground
I'll never come around
And you'll never hear a word from me
If it's an all night thing
Well, I walked along
Feeling at ease
And falling like rain
Ooh, into her scheme
And she won't let on
What that'll be
Yeah, but I'm guessing
Ooh, it's an all night thing
Yeah, it's an all night thing
If it's an all night thing
Nobody is gonna make it end
And if it don't begin
Don't worry that I'll take offense
Yeah, if it's an all night thing
And we fall like a tear falling to the ground
I'll never come around
And you'll never hear a word from me
If it's an all night thing
Yeah, if it's an all night thing
Ooh, if it's an all night thing
Yeah, if it's an all night thing
Mmm
