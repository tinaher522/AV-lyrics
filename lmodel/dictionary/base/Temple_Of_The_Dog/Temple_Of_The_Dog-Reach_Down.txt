<song artist="Temple_Of_The_Dog" title="Reach_Down">
Well, I had a dream the other night
You were in a bar in the corner on a chair
Wearing a long white leather coat
Purple glasses and glitter in your hair
And you said, hey, this is where I wanna sit
And buy you a drink someday
Well, you were going to the dog shows
But you kinda lost your way
Now you say, I got all this room
And no money to decorate it
So some local customer
Put me in touch with the Man upstairs
He said, "Little man,
You got no business bein' all frustrated.
You gotta rest
You gotta rest
You gotta rest"
You gotta reach down and pick the crowd up
Oh, I wanna reach down and pick the crowd up
Carry back in my hand to the promised land
To the promised land
Ooh, I had some angel shine my wings
She said, "Nothin' but the best for the golden boy.
And she made me promise not to tell
I had her under a spell
Singing golden words in a broken voice
Now I caught some blessing on the wind
I'm feeling lighter than a breath from a dove
I've got no hands to tie behind my back
And I'm sparking like a heart attack
And I've got room to spread my wings
And my messages of love, yeah
Love was my drug
But that's not what I died of
So don't think of me
Crying louder than some Billion Dollar Baby
Ooh, I wanna rest
I wanna rest
I wanna rest
I wanna reach down and pick the crowd up
I wanna reach down and pick the crowd up
Carry back in my hand to the promised land
To the promised land
To the promised land, oh
Yeah,  I wanna reach down
Oh yeah, and pick the crowd up
(I wanna reach down) I wanna reach down
(And pick the crowd up) And pick the crowd up
(Carry back in my hand) Hand
(To the promised land) To the promised land
(To the promised land) Ooh yeah
Ah oh
