<song artist="Temple_Of_The_Dog" title="Four_Walled_World">
Well she cried and she cried all night
To the sound of the freeway hum
And she swears she'll be gone
When the sun hits the ground
And she ain't coming back to my cell
To my cell, ooh
Well she's tired and she's tired
Of this life she's been leading too long
And the time turns around
Through these walls that surround
To the chimes of a jailor's song
Oh, but in my four, in my four
In my four, my four walled world
In my four, in my four
In my four, my four walled world
And she tries and she tries
But my feet that just won't leave the ground
And I'm tired and I'm tired
Of this prisoners life
And these chains that drag me down
Oh, but in my four, in my four
In my four, my four walled world
Yeah, in my four, oh, in my four
In my four, my four walled world
And she cried and she cried all night
To the sound of the freeway hum
And she swears she'll be gone
When the sun hits the ground
And she ain't, no she ain't coming back to my cell
And now the sun is low
And these walls try to break my soul
And now the moon is full
And I won't see nothing tonight
But the tears in her eyes in my four
Yeah, in my four walled world
Yeah, in my four walled world
Yeah, in my four, oh my four
Yeah, my four, oh my four walled world
Yeah, my four walled world
Yeah, in my four, in my four walled world
Yeah, in my four, my four, my four walled world
Yeah, yeah
My four walled world, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, in my four, in my four walled world, yeah
Four, in my four, in my four walled world, yeah
In my four walled world, yeah
