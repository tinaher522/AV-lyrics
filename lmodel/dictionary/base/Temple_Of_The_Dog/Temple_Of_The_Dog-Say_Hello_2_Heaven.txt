<song artist="Temple_Of_The_Dog" title="Say_Hello_2_Heaven">
Yeah, ooh
Please, Mother Mercy
Take me from this place
And the long winded curses
I hear in my head
Words never listen
And teachers, oh they never learn
But I'm warm from the candle
Though I feel too cold to burn
He came from an island
And he died from the street
And he hurt so bad, like a soul breaking
But he never said nothing to me, yeah
Say hello 2 Heaven, Heaven, Heaven
Say hello 2 Heaven, Heaven, Heaven
New like a baby
Lost like a prayer
The sky was your playground
But the cold ground was your bed
Ooh, said poor Stargazer
She's got no tears in her eyes
But smooth like a whisper
She knows love heals all wounds with time
Now it seems like too much love
Is never enough
Yeah, you better seek out another road
'Cause this one has ended abrupt, oh oh
Say hello 2 Heaven, Heaven, Heaven
Say hello 2 Heaven, Heaven, Heaven
Say hello 2 Heaven, Heaven, Heaven
I, I never wanted
To write these words down for you
With the pages of phrases
Of things we'll never do
Hey, so I blow out the candle
And I put you to bed
Since you can't say to me now how the dogs broke your bone
There's just one thing left to be said
Say hello 2 Heaven, 2 Heaven, yeah
Say hello 2 Heaven, 2 Heaven, yeah
Say hello 2 Heaven, 2 Heaven, yeah
Say hello 2 Heaven, 2 Heaven, yeah, oh
