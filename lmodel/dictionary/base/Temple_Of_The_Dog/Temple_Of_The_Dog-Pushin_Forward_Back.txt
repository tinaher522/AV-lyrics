<song artist="Temple_Of_The_Dog" title="Pushin_Forward_Back">
Mother, Mother found me on her step
Gracious Mother held me to her breast
Until the day I started pushin'
Too late to cry, she turned away, I started pushin'
I saw no future in this lack
I started pushin', pushin', pushin' forward back
I was pushin', pushin', pushin' forward back
I was pushin', pushin', pushin' forward back
I was pushin', pushin', pushin' forward back
Baby brother clinging to her hair
Gracious Mother pleading "Not another 
Soul to bare," he started pushin'
All my kings have fallen down, I started pushin'
Fallen heroes feed the ground
I started pushin', pushin', pushin' forward back
I was pushin', pushin', pushin' forward back
I was pushin', pushin', pushin' forward back
I was pushin', pushin', pushin' forward back
Falling down
Now I know her
I know I'll never drown, drown, drown
Falling down
Now I know her
I know I'll never drown, drown, drown
Oh, I was pushin'
I was pushin',  pushin', pushin' forward back
I was pushin',  pushin', pushin' forward back
I was pushin',  pushin', pushin' forward back
I was pushin',  pushin', pushin' forward back
I was pushin',  pushin', pushin' forward back
I was pushin',  pushin', pushin' forward back
I was pushin',  pushin', pushin' forward back
I was pushin',  pushin', pushin' forward back
I was pushin',  pushin', pushin' forward back
I was pushin',  pushin', pushin' forward back
