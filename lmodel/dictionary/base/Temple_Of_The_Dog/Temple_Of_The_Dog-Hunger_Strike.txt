<song artist="Temple_Of_The_Dog" title="Hunger_Strike">
I don't mind stealing bread
From the mouths of decadence
But I can't feed on the powerless
When my cup's already overfilled, yeah
But it's on the table, the fire's cooking
And they're farming babies while slaves are all working
Blood is on the table and their mouths are choking
But I'm going hungry, yeah
I don't mind stealing bread
From the mouths of decadence
But I can't feed on the powerless
When my cup's already overfilled
But it's on the table, the fire's cooking
And they're farming babies while slaves are all working
And it's on the table, the mouths are choking
But I'm going hungry (going hungry)
I'm going hungry (going hungry)
I'm going hungry (going hungry)
I'm going hungry (going hungry)
I'm going hungry (going hungry)
I'm going hungry (going hungry)
Yeah, I don't mind stealin' bread (I don't mind)
No, I don't mind stealin' bread
I'm going hungry (going hungry)
I'm going hungry (going hungry)
