<song artist="Temple_Of_The_Dog" title="Your_Saviour">
People like you, I know myself
Walk in the shoes of somebody else
Whisper to me my tragic fate
Whisper to me my tragic end
But don't give me your saviour
But don't give me your saviour
I said hey, yeah
Yeah, people I choose life on my own
Burn me your fuse, throw me your stones
Give me your brand, burn on my hand
Whisper to me my tragic end
But don't give me your saviour
Don't give me your saviour
I said hey, yeah
Oh, people I choose, I know myself
Lay my need out, give you my help
But you give me your blues
And you whisper my fate
But don't give me, don't give me your your saviour
Don't give me
Don't give me
I follow me
I follow me
I follow me
I follow me
I follow me
I follow me
Follow
