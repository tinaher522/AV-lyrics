<song artist="K._Michelle" title="Padded_Room">
Its like watching TV with the sound turn off, 
I'm trying to catch up with myself because im lost, I'm lost 
How does he remote control. pushing on my buttons hes the only one who knows me (yea) 
Its like he took my heart and soul, and deleted it,i came back for more he repeated it, 
Told me that i needed it and know im half crazy 
Taking medication daily, somebody pray for me..
(Chorus)
Got me pulling out my hair (hair). 
Pacing back and forth (forth), 
Staring at the ceiling. 
Curled up on the floor.. Whoa
Just lock me in a padded room (twice) 
Cant somebody save me from myself (self),
Im in need of help (help).
Don't have much mental left, so
This is for my health.
(why don't you)
Just lock me in a padded room (2x)
Its like im going crazy, somebody please pray for me
Give me that jacket with a thousand zippers,
I don't like what i see when i look in the mirror,
Hear a billions of voice but yours clearer, 
It feels like someone chasing me thats getting nearer  
So im running in circles imagine every hurdle  tryna get away 
And I know what you would say and now im half crazy 
Taking medications daily,somebody pray me..
(Chorus)
Got me pulling out my hair (hair).
Pacing back and forth (forth), 
Staring at the ceiling. 
Curled up on the floor..Whoa
Just lock me in a padded room (twice) 
Cant somebody save me from myself (self),
I'm in need of help (help).
Don't have much mental left, so
This is for my health . 
(why don't you)
Just lock me in a padded room (2x)
Got me hearing things,seeing things,
Wide awake, dreaming things. ima bout to scream. 
Cause i don't like what you've done to me,
Locked me up tossed the keys ..
Baby this ain't fair .. 
(Got me pulling my hair)
(Chorus)
