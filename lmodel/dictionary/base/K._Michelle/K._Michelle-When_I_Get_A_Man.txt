<song artist="K._Michelle" title="When_I_Get_A_Man">
It's been a while since I had a love that's all mine;
Niggas came and went, and I've wasted my time...
I'm maintaining, screaming out, "Fuck it, I'll be fine,"
But I can't act like it don't ever cross my mind... 
I would give all this shit up just to stay home and be your wife,
Fold some clothes, give you what you like,
Boy, you just don't know...
You gon' luck up when you get it - boy, you bet' not miss it;
Wanna give you all this love...
'Cause when I find a man, he's gonna love me, yeah;
I'ma cater, serve ya, give you what you deserve - he's gonna love me...
'Cause when I find a man, he's gonna love me, yeah;
I'ma cater, serve ya, give you what you deserve - he's gonna love me...
(When I get a man...)
I'm gon' roll it up, pack it up, pour it how you like;
Baby, one hit just might change your whole life... oh, boy...
Baby, I'm down to ride, I'm in the passenger side, oh, boy;
This good love we got can't be denied...
I wanna give all this shit up just to come home to you at night...
Don't care how I feel, I'll make sure you right;
You can have whatever you like...
You gon' luck up when you get it - boy, you bet' not miss it;
I'ma give you all this love...
'Cause when I find a man, he's gonna love me... yeah!
I'ma cater, serve ya, give you what you deserve - he's gonna love me...
'Cause when I find a man, he's gonna love me, yeah;
I'ma cater, serve ya, give you what you deserve - he's gonna love me...
(When I get a man...)
Oh, I'ma treat him like a king, he gon' be my everything, he gon' love the hell outta me, yeah!
I won't hold back anything - no more heartbreak, I got a new song to sing, yeah...
'Cause when I find a man, he's gonna love me, yeah! (He's gonna love me, yeah!)
I'ma cater, serve ya, give you what you deserve - he's gonna love me... (Serve ya! Give you what you deserve!)
(When I get a) man, he's gonna love me, yeah;
I'ma cater, serve ya, give you what you deserve - he's gonna love me...
(When I get a man...)
