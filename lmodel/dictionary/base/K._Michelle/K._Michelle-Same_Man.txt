<song artist="K._Michelle" title="Same_Man">
Everything's hard to break
You can bet
That it's gonna be mine
And if then our tears still fall
You can bet
There's a man behind them all
'Cause I keep on doing the same damn things
I'm loving the same, expecting different endings
But it's like you never learned until it starts to burn
The same face, a different day
Same hurt, I'm ready to break
Can't get to a new place
'Cause I keep loving the same man
I try to stay away
Hope that you don't find me
The past is repeating
But I'm loving the same man
Oh... loving the same man... yea
If things are bad to pack
You can bet
That it's gonna be mine
And just when I'm on my way out
You can bet
That I'm gonna turn around
'Cause I keep on doing the same damn things
I'm loving the same, expecting different endings
But it's like you never learned until it starts to burn
The same face, a different day
Same hurt, I'm ready to break
Can't get to a new place
'Cause I keep loving the same man
I try to stay away
Hope that you don't find me
The past is repeating
But I'm loving the same man
It's always like when I get there
Although good ones are somewhere else
And I'm always left when it's gone wrong
I know this ain't where I've been wrong
I thought I'd think of so much more
But I keep repeating
'Cause I'm loving the same man
The same face, a different day
Same hurt, I'm ready to break
(He was crazy, he was lazy)
Can't get to a new place
(Don't know how to treat a lady)
'Cause I keep dating the same damn fools
I try to stay away
(But I tried everything, God knows I tried yea)
Hope that you don't find me
The past is repeating
I'm loving the same man
I keep loving... loving the same man
