<song artist="K._Michelle" title="Ride_Out">
You won't understand the tears I cried
All those nights you weren't around
You crossed the line and now its time
All 'cause you weren't around
Chorus:
So don't be mad when I get in
My shit and ride out
You gonna be mad when another nigga show up and show out.
You gonna be mad, when you look back and see you missed out
You're gonna try to callin' back but I ain't wit it now
It's too late, yeah eyyy eyy
Oh it's too late, yeaah, eyyy
You never thought i'd walk away
But things change when you're not around
You gave me no choice, can't justify
Why you were never around?
Chorus:
So don't be mad when I get in
My shit and ride out
You gonna be mad when another nigga show up and show out.
You're gonna try to callin' back but I ain't without
It's too late, yeah, eyyy eyy
Oh it's too late, yeaah, eyyy
Ain't nothing 'bout this love gonna work
Thought it could fix it but I'm still worth
You put me through more than I deserve
You had your chance but now it's this turn.
It's too late, yeah eeey eyyy
It's too late yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah
Huh huh huh
Chorus:
So don't be mad when I get in
My shit and ride out
You can't be mad when another nigga show up and show out.
You're gonna be mad when you look back and see you missed out
Mhm ohh.
