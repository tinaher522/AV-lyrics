<song artist="K._Michelle" title="I_Just_Can't_Do_This">
You say you love me
But we don't make love
You say, "Nothing's changed"
Yet I pull and you shove
I call your phone several times
And you don't pick up
And I'm not just gon' keep blowin' you up
(I've had enough of this)
I'm always pleasing you
(Boy, you forget)
That I've got needs too
But I'm so afraid to walk away from you
I don't know what you want me to do
Said you used to be my sunshine
In the mist of the rain
And you used to ease my mind
When my heart was in pain
I was the hand and you were my glove
Tell me what did you do with the man that I love?
Used to make me feel that I could fly
But now all I wanna do is lay down and die
Now I take your cursing
Your drinking and even flirting
Smile for the camera
When I'm really hurting
But everyday
You make me feel it's for certain
And no matter what I do
It just ain't working
(I've had enough of this)
I'm always pleasing you
(But you forget)
That I've got needs too
I'm just so afraid to walk away from you
I don't wanna hate you but it's what I must do
Said you used to be my sunshine
In the mist of the rain
And you used to ease my mind
When my heart was in pain
I was the hand and you were my glove
Tell me what did you do with the man that I love?
Used to make me feel that I could fly
But now all I wanna do is lay down and die
