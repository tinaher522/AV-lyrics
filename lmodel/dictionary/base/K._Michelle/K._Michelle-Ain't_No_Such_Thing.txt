Yoooouuuuuuuuu..... Yoouuuu
You say you'll die for me
Well baby die (why you still standin here)
You still breathin, yeaaah
Can you tell me why? (hey, hey)
And if you talkin to hear yoself talk
Do me a favor and don't
Screw your will cause I know you won't
Damn your do cause I know you don't
And I don't claim to know everything
But baby what you tellin me
Ain't no such thing, Ain't no such thing
Somebody betta tell em, somebody betta tell em bout me
Show me a man that won't lie
And a man that won't cheat
In my world that's somethin I ain't never seen
Ain't no such thing
Somebody betta tell em
Somebody betta tell em
Somebody betta tell em bout me
You say ya thang only rise for me
But you got three kids
Two baby mamas
One on the way
So let's keep it real how high..
And how you gon make me queen in these streets
And that's funny I'm everywhere, boy you're never there
Besides, I'm already sleeping with the king
And if you talkin to hear yoself talk
Do me a favor and don't
Screw your will cause I know you won't
Damn your do cause I know you don't (hey!)
And I don't claim to know everything
But baby what you tellin me
Ain't no such thing, Ain't no such thing
Somebody betta tell em, somebody betta tell em bout me
Show me a man that won't lie
And a man that won't cheat
In my world that's somethin I ain't never seen
Ain't no such thing
Somebody betta tell em
Somebody betta tell em
Somebody betta tell em bout me
Tell em bout me, ooohh baby
Tell you that I've been through way too much pain
To even think about you runnin some game
So you can keep it pushin, baby keep it movin
Eff my feelings
And I don't claim to know everything
But baby what you tellin me
Ain't no such thing, Ain't no such thing
Somebody betta tell em, somebody betta tell em bout me
Show me a man that won't lie
And a man that won't cheat
In my world that's somethin I ain't never seen
Baby ain't no such thing
Somebody betta tell em
Somebody betta tell em
Somebody betta tell em bout me (til fade)
