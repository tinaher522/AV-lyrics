<song artist="K._Michelle" title="What_Kind_Of_Man_Are_You">
You know what they say real men do real thangs.
But u know its cool.
No hate No love but there aint no hate.
Cuz if u knew better u do better.
For reaL, yup!
I should have never loved you in the first place.
Now its hard for me to look you in your face.
I am askin God to please remove this hate.
If whats done is done then it just might be to late.
You've become the enemy when you put ur hands on me.
Cuz I never thought I'd see, the day when I don't want you.
With everything we been thru.
Now I am askin you what kind of man are you?
How u just gon up an leave?
When I gave you all of me?
This shit I cant believe.
What kind of man are you?
Your not the man I thought you'd be.
No Nooo
So I am askin you again What kind of man are you?
I love you so much that I prayed with you.
Your lifes been hard but my lifes been hard to.
My soul my head my heart is so confused.
Didnt think that you could hurt me like you do.
Treat me like you do an I was good to you.
Had ur back when others turned they back on you.
People warned me about you but I told em its not true.
Now I look just like ur fool
Now I am askin you what kind of man are you?
How u just gon up an leave?
When I gave you all of me?
This shit I cant believe.
What kind of man are you?
Your not the man I thought you'd be.
No Nooo
What kind of man would lie to me in my face.
Make love to me everyday.
This is my life, not some type of game you play.
But I promise this is the end.
Hell no we can't be friends.
Cuz I don't want to see your ass again.
Now I am askin you what kind of man are you?
How u just gon up an leave?
When I gave you all of me?
This shit I cant believe.
What kind of man are you?
Your not the man I thought you'd be.
No Nooo
