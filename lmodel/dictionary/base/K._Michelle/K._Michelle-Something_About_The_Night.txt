<song artist="K._Michelle" title="Something_About_The_Night">
Oh, I wanna roll one up, pull my hair up, got a full cup, don't give a fuck, oh no, oh no;
Oh, it'll be too long, 'cause when you're gone and I get home, I need to get on you, on you...
Is it your good looks or your lips below that make me blow?
Is it the way you act like you don't care when I'm the only one who kiss you there, oh?
You know it's true...
Something about the night;
Might let you come in, just might let you come in...
Something about the night
That keep me coming, that keep me coming...
Oh, I got my butter cake all in your face, my oven's hot, just watch me bake - good Lord, oh, oh;
Oh, and eat it up and lick the plate - you know you just can't have one taste, no... no, no, no, no...
Is it your good looks or your lips below that make me blow?
Is it the way you act like you don't care when I'm the only one who kiss you there, oh?
Something about the night;
Might let you come in, just might let you come in...
Something about the night
That keep me coming, that keep me coming...
Something about the night;
I just wanna ride, I just wanna ride...
Something about the night;
It's a different kinda high, different kinda high...
Something about the night;
Might let you come in, might let you come in...
Something about the night
That keep me coming, yeah, keep me coming...
Something about tonight;
I just wanna ride, I just wanna ride...
Something about the night, night, night;
Different kinda high, different kinda high...
