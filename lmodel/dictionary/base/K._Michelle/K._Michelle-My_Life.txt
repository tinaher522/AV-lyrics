<song artist="K._Michelle" title="My_Life">
My life my life is this, my life, oh
What you know about the grind in the streets?
He moving work out of time every week
I know about it!
I know about it!
What you know about 'em girls on the pole?
She make her money every night taking off her clothes
I know about it!
Yep I know about it
Cause all my life I've been struggling and stressing
That's why I come up in this bitch with aggression
Where I'm from niggas die everyday
Bet you ain't never seen a nigga die right in ya face
Hook: 
The life, the life, the sacrifice
The grind, the grind you get sometimes
I know about it!
Don't judge if you know nothing about it!
You try and try to live right
But we get blinded by the life
Oh, oh, I know about it
Don't judge if you know nothing bout it!
These niggas turning hoes into wifes
Went in raw now you stuck with her for life
I know about it!
Bet y'all know something about it!
Three years he been doing the same thing
You can hang it up you'll never get a ring,
Cause I know about it!
Bet I know some thing about it!
Cause all my life I've been struggling and stressing
That's why I come up in this bitch with aggression
Where I'm from it ain't flowers and candy
I'm just happy the life didn't get me!
Hook: 
The life, the life, the sacrifice
The grind, the grind you get sometimes
I know about it!
Don't judge if you know nothing about it!
You try and try to live right
But we get blinded by the life
Oh, oh, I know about it
Don't judge if you know nothing bout it!
Uh, yeah I said the life, the life
The streets are a bitch and I made her my wife
I made her my wife, I couldn't afford but I made her my price
Cause under the lights the money the cars
Even the ice I wanted it all
So we was up nights, we were up selling the raw
And ducking them D from a hell of charge
I wanted to shine amongst with the stars
I wanted to grind they're calling me nah
I felt like these niggas was telling me starve
My mama she told me I'm headed for bars (bars)
And where did it take me?
To a cell and a yard
Running bar with the killers
Talking fellas and all
Hook: 
The life, the life, the sacrifice
The grind, the grind you get sometimes
I know about it!
Don't judge if you know nothing about it!
You try and try to live right
But we get blinded by the life
Oh, oh, I know about it
Don't judge if you know nothing bout it!
