<song artist="K._Michelle" title="Hard_To_Do">
I been thinkin' 'bout you, are you thinkin' 'bout me?
I know I went crazy, but you were wrong...
I apologize, I'll let it go tonight;
Forgive me and I'll forgive you...
Oh, 'cause what you gon' do when I put that pretty thang on you?
Oh, I usually don't do this, but I'll do it for you, oh...
Oh, baby, 'cause missin' you is way too hard to do;
I'd rather be fuckin' you...
Do you mind if I give you love, 'cause I just wanna give you love?
Would you tell me if I'm doin' too much? 
Missin' you is way too hard to do...
Lately, I been in my feelings, dealing with the
Daily thoughts of missin' you, oh...
I ain't dailin', but my body's callin' for you,
Breaking down how to give it to you...
Oh, 'cause what you gon' do when I put that pretty thang on you?
Oh, I usually don't do this, but I'll do it for you, oh...
Oh, baby, 'cause missin' you is way too hard to do;
I'd rather be fuckin' you...
Do you mind if I give you love, 'cause I just wanna give you love?
Would you tell me if I'm doin' too much? 
Missin' you is way too hard...
Don't get along all the time, just want your body on mine,
And you can call it what you wanna, but I'ma call you when I want it...
Fishnets and trench coats and underneath, it's a bomb;
America's Most Wanted - errbody up on it...
What you gon' do when I put that pretty thang on you?
Oh, I usually don't do this, but I'll do it for you, oh...
Oh, baby, 'cause missin' you is way too hard to do;
I'd rather be fuckin' you...
Do you mind if I give you love, 'cause I just wanna give you love?
Would you tell me if I'm doin' too much? 
Missin' you is way too hard to do...
