<song artist="K._Michelle" title="Judge_Me">
Heaven, heaven, don't say 'bye to my soul;
I just wanna make it, make it the doors before they close...
Oh, I hate that I couldn't get right even if I tried;
It's a sin how we love, but only God can judge...
Judge me, judge me all you want;
I'm only human, and I'm perfectly flawed...
I know it's easy to point the finger at me, 'cause I say the things that only y'all think,
So judge me if you need - I bet Eve was just like me...
Oh, who wouldn't bite the apple in front of your face?
I know that I love, I love the way temptation tastes...
Oh, I hate that I couldn't get right even if I tried;
It's a sin how we love, but only God can judge...
Judge me, judge me all you want;
I'm only human, and I'm perfectly flawed...
I know it's easy to point the finger at me, 'cause I say the things that only y'all think,
So judge me if you need - I bet Eve was just like me...
Judge... judge me, judge me all you want;
I'm only human, and I'm perfectly flawed...
I know it's easy to point the finger at me, 'cause I say the things that only y'all think,
So judge me if you need - I bet Eve was just like me...
(Just like me...
I bet Eve was just like me...
Just like me...
Just like me...)
