<song artist="K._Michelle" title="Sky_Is_Falling">
You say u found love and I believed every word that you said
You said that you found all this in me 
I'm the one you couldn't get out your head
But now i know its a lie (Oh Why)
Could of had me so (But now i know the truth your so cold)
I can see (clearly)
The first thing you lied about was how you felt about me 
I let you interrupt my life because you said we build everything off of trust 
But now your a liar and my heart denies ya
I don't understand why you're calling
I guess now the sky is falling, falling
When you lie you must think of me 
I Guess now the sky is falling, falling
Enough is enough, 
Cause i Know this ain't love
(spoken) 
The Sky is falling (3x)
I wake up, hoping that everything was a dream but you're not right here next to me, 
Now i realize i made you leave
Now i know i did it right (oh why)
Your lies was so bold (But now i know the truth your so cold)
I can see (clearly) Everything you lied about I just cant believe
(Chorus)
I let you interrupt my life because you said we would build everything off of trust 
But now your a liar and my heart denies ya
I don't understand why you're calling
I guess now the sky is falling, falling
When you lie you must think of me 
I Guess now the sky is falling, falling
Enough is enough, 
Cause i Know this ain't love
(Bridge)
My heart cant afford to listen anymore.. 
Cause once i believe thats what im riding for,
Cause I cant ignore, all the pain I endure..
I wont take the lying, im tired of crying, I'm tired of hoping,tired of waiting, I'm tired of trying,I'm  tired of losing
I give it to you and what did you do, 
You twisted the truth 
(chorus)
