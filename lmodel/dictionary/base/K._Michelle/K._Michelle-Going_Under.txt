<song artist="K._Michelle" title="Going_Under">
My left side feel so heavy, feet ain't steady;
Feels like my heart is giving out...
How come I'm so hard-headed, so forgiving,
Forgetting how you bring me down...
Who's gonna pick me up? Who's gonna give a fuck? Whoa, oh, oh...
Who's gonna go the mile? Fly me to the clouds?
I'm singing love, don't fail me now, don't count me out;
Oh, love, ooh, love, don't let me down, come back around...
Hey, it's like a jungle sometimes - it make me wonder how I keep from going under...
It's like a jungle sometimes - it make me wonder how I keep from going under...
It's like a jungle sometimes - it make me wonder how I keep from going under...
It's like a jungle sometimes - it make me wonder how I keep from going under...
My vision so misleading - make-believing
In things I never saw;
Deep inside, we're not right, no - things got different;
Oh, it's not what we thought, no...
Who's gonna pick me up? Who's gonna give a fuck? Whoa, oh, oh...
Who's gonna go the mile? Fly me to the clouds?
I'm singing love, don't fail me now, don't count me out;
Oh, love, ooh, love, don't let me down, come back around...
(Hey...) It's like a jungle sometimes - it make me wonder how I keep from going under...
It's like a jungle sometimes - it makes me wonder how I keep from going under...
It's like a jungle sometimes - it make me wonder how I keep from going under...
It's like a jungle sometimes - it make me wonder how I keep from going under...
Every day, it's a fight, sinking fast, (going down;)
I just wanna get back right, so I need you out of my life...
I'm singing love, don't fail me now, don't count me out;
Oh, love, ooh, love, don't let me down, come back around...
It's like a jungle sometimes - it make me wonder how I keep from going under...
It's like a jungle sometimes - it make me wonder how I keep from going under...
It's like a jungle sometimes - it make me wonder how I keep from going under...
It's like a jungle sometimes - it make me wonder how I keep from going under...
