<song artist="K._Michelle" title="Drake_Would_Love_Me">
I would be the apple of his eye, and he would treat me like his grand prize;
Trophy, make me feel every bit worth it...
I would be his centerpiece and he'd show me off while we're at the Grammys,
Winning, nominated, they'd hate it...
But even though you don't appreciate me, you can't see what I see,
But someone will believe in me and the love that I'm giving...
Drake would love me, he would kiss me, he would touch me like I need;
Drake wouldn't leave me, he would keep me, never break his promises...
I'd be the best he ever had - he'd be on his best behavior, he would make me so proud;
Oh, Drake would love me...
I would never ever have to cry and if I did, yes, he would make it right;
Take care of me - for me, he'd do anything, oh, yeah...
He wouldn't change, he'd always stay the same - he would tell the truth, he wouldn't play no games;
His motto would be giving me his all...
Oh, I know that you don't appreciate me - you can't see what I see;
Someone will believe in me and the love that I'm giving...
Drake would love me, he would kiss me, he would touch me like I need;
Drake wouldn't leave me, he would keep me, never break his promises...
I'd be the best he ever had - he'd be on his best behavior, he would make me so proud;
Oh... oh, oh... Drake would love me...
There comes a time in a woman's life when she knows it ain't worth a fight;
This can't be love, this can't be life...
I'm a good woman, not afraid to let go;
That's how I know...
Drake would love me, he would kiss me, he would touch me like I need;
Drake wouldn't leave me, he would keep me, never break his promises...
I'd be the best he ever had - he'd be on his best behavior, he would make me so proud;
Oh, Drake would love me, love me, love me...
Drake would love me... me, yes...
