<song artist="K._Michelle" title="The_Right_One">
You got the right one...
You got the right one...
I just really hate you;
All that game you've been runnin', now it's time that I played you...
And why I let you do me;
Like doors wide open, you ran right through me...
But you done found the right one, nigga...
Fuck you and all that;
Blast on Twitter, then I'ma blast back...
You want ratchet, then I'ma be that;
Don't make me call my boys and have yo' shit peeled back, oh!
Ooh, you really don't know how you makin' me feel:
You make me wanna kill a mane...
Ooh, you really gonna make me show you how I feel;
You got the right one, nigga...
You got the right one... oh...
You got the right one...
Damn, I really hate you;
I'ma say it again, 'cause the truth is I made you...
Now you out here frontin', when you was just...
Beggin' me in the rain, down on your knees, tryna explain...
See, you know I know the truth, but still you wanna go there;
You got the right one, nigga...
Fuck you and all that;
Blast on Twitter, then I'ma blast back...
You want ratchet, then I'ma be that;
Don't make me call my boys and have yo' shit peeled back, oh!
Ooh, you really don't know how you makin' me feel:
You make me wanna kill a mane...
Ooh, you really gon' make me show you how I feel;
You got the right one, nigga...
You got the right one... (Now you gon see who you been dealin' with...) Yeah...
You got the right one... (Now you gon see who you been dealin' with...) Oh...
Don't wanna make up, don't wanna be homies,
And when you see me, act like you don't know me...
You think you fly, you think you grown;
Ever since I left, you been calling my phone...
(You ain't never gon' find another chick like me,
You ain't never gon' find another chick like me, no...)
Fuck you and all that;
Blast on Twitter, then I'ma blast back...
You want ratchet, then I'ma be that;
Don't make me call my boys and have yo' shit peeled back, oh!
Ooh, you really don't know how you makin' me feel:
You make me wanna kill a mane...
Ooh, you really gon' make me show you how I feel;
You got the right one, nigga...
You got the right one... (You thought you got away, but I got yo' black ass...)
You got the right one... (That's why you lost the game, and I laughed at yo' black ass...)
And that's the end! Leave it there!
