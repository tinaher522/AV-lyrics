<song artist="K._Michelle" title="Cry">
Yeah, yeah...
Nobody's off limits, not even your friends;
I'm 'bout to go in, 'bout to go in, 'bout to go in...
I'ma do somethin' I never do;
I'ma try and hurt you too...
Feels so damn good to be cold, 
And I don't even care if you know...
I'ma let 'em kiss my body, touch my body, record it, and make sure you find it;
How you gon' trip? Boy, you been with everybody...
You started, I'ma finish;
You made that bed, now you gon' lay in it...
You gon' suffer, you gon' suffer for everything you did;
You gon' suffer, you gon' suffer - I done took too much of this...
You gon' cry, you gon' pay me in tears;
You gon' cry - you owe me for all these years...
You gon' cry, 'cause it's not about love, it's all about revenge,
So cry, cry...
I learned from the best, I learned from you;
It's easy to do the shit that you do...
I can just switch it up on you - used to be me that was out here stressin';
So your gift became a curse - now you miss your blessing...
You gon' suffer, you gon' suffer for everything you did;
I'm not bitter - stay with her - maybe she can take your shit...
You gon' cry, you gon' pay me in tears;
You gon' cry - you owe me for all these years...
You gon' cry, 'cause it's not about love, it's all about revenge,
So cry, cry...
I just had to get my point across before all we had was lost...
Now we are both hurt by the one we love;
I know it's wrong, but I wanna see you...
Cry, cry...
Cry, cry...
You gon' cry, you gon' pay me in tears;
You gon' cry - you owe me for all these years...
You gon' cry, 'cause it's not about love, it's all about revenge,
So cry! Cry...
