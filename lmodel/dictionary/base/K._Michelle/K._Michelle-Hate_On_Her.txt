<song artist="K._Michelle" title="Hate_On_Her">
There's a smile without a home, there's a heart that can't beat no more;
How could she be the one you want when I'm giving you so much?
In this house we made our own, you have tore it down to nothing;
For the moment of a stroke, you let it all go...
Now she's callin' your phone,
Rollin; her eyes at me like I'm the one who did wrong,
Tryna play my role...
But I can't even hate on her, 'cause I know you got no heart;
I can't even hate on her, 'cause I know how low you go...
And you made it feel right when you know you was wrong,
So I can't even hate on her...
(Hate on her...)
See, that moment, it can't be erased, memories that can't be replaced...
How could you even look me in my face? Years ruined in one day...
Poor girl, she don't even know that grown boys don't ever grow;
She will always, she will always feel alone...
So when she's calling my phone,
Next time, I'ma let her know
She can have you, I'm gone;
Man, love can be so cold...
But I can't even hate on her, 'cause I know you got no heart;
I can't even hate on her, 'cause I know how low you go...
And you made it feel right when you know you was wrong,
So I can't even hate on her...
(Hate on her...)
Oh, I've given my everything,
Oh, but you took it all from me...
Oh, I hope she can be all you need,
'Cause I can't be, yeah...
I can't even hate on her, 'cause I know you got no heart;
I can't even hate on her, 'cause I know how low you go...
And you made it feel right when you know you was wrong,
So I can't even hate on her...
(Hate on her...)
Oh, I've given my everything,
Oh, but you took it all from me...
