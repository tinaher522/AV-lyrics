<song artist="K._Michelle" title="Fallin'">
Feels like I'm fallin', fallin', fallin'
Feels like I'm broken, broken, broken
Sun don't even shine, I don't wanna go outside
Feels like I'm dyin', dyin', dyin'
I can't believe that it's over
See, I've been crying, like, five days straight and
I want this hurt to be over
My girls be saying the same ole things, sayin'
"It's gonna be okay"
Alright, but when's okay comin'?
"Girl, you don't need him"
But they're not the one that loved him
They don't know this pain
Never felt the same
So too me it's like
Feels like I've fallin'
I've fallen and I can't get up
Fallen and I can't get up
Feels like I'm broken
And you're not here to fix me up
You're not here to fix me up
Feels like the sun don't even shine
I don't wanna go outside
This is my sunshine
Feels like I'm dyin'
Dyin' to be back in your arms
Just what it feels like baby
All this time that we put in this
See, I don't wanna have to start all over
How I act like you don't exist
When there's portraits of your face all over
Everywhere I look
I'm seein' something that reminds me of you
I do, yeah
I think my mind is playin' games
Tell me if you feel the same
Baby, let me explain
Feels like I've fallin'
I've fallen and I can't get up
Fallen and I can't get up
Feels like I'm broken
And you're not here to fix me up
You're not here to fix me up
Feels like the sun don't even shine
I don't wanna go outside
Now that you're gone
Feels like I'm dyin'
Dyin' to be back in your arms
Just what it feels like baby
I'm so torn inside
Oh, I just want you back here, right by my side
'Cause you're the only thing that's real in my life
Boy, I need you back with me
Oh, so tell me what's it going to be
Feels like I've fallin'
I've fallen and I can't get up
Fallen and I can't get up
Feels like I'm broken
And you're not here to fix me up
You're not here to fix me up
Feels like the sun don't even shine
I don't wanna go outside
Feels like I'm dyin'
Dyin' to be back in your arms
Just what it feels like baby
You need to come on home, baby
