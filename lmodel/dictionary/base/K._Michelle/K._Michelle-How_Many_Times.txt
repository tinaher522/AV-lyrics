<song artist="K._Michelle" title="How_Many_Times">
[Verse 1]
If you were hurt like I was before
Ladies go turn up your radio
Cause Ima sing this one for us, yeah
See they complain about our attitude
Talk about the things we do
To me it seems so obvious
They like it, they keep coming, keep coming back
For more, yea
You  always so quick to up and criticize
I got my flaws and yes I realize
I become so hard to deal with cause this part of my heart is so tired
[Chorus]
How many times, how many times, how many times
Ooh, I caught you on the phone with her
How many times, how many times, how many times
Did I take you back and you broke my heart
Ooh this song know how I feel
You betrayed my love
Ooh and the moral of the story is
How many times
How many times
[Verse 2]
Our sister, our sister Mary she used to tell us bout this in the 90's
I used to say that I'd never be, no never never me
But it's 2011 and I feel I can't get any lower
Taking out my anger on any and everybody that comes around me
I become so hard to deal with cuz this part of my heart is so tired
[Chorus]
How many times, how many times, how many times
I caught you on the phone with her
How many times, how many times, how many times
Did I take you back and you broke my heart
Ooh this song knows how I feel
You betrayed my love
And the moral of the story is
How many times
How many times
[Bridge]
How many times must Icry here (I'm so tired of crying)
And how many times should my son see my tears(Wish you'd go away)
How many of ya'll going through the same thing
Ooh, I've become so hard to deal with cuz this part of my heart is so tired
I'm so tired
[Chorus]
How many times, how many times, how many times
I caught you on the phone with her
How many times, how many times, how many times
Did I take you back and you broke my heart
Ooh this song knows how I feel
You betrayed my love
And the moral of the story is
How many times
How many times
[2nd Bridge]
How many times do I gotta get hurt to know it ain't never gone get no better
How many times ladies have you been hurt and you know in your heart it won't get no better
You, you
This one's for you
You, you
This one's for you
