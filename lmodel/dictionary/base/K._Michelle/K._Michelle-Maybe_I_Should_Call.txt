<song artist="K._Michelle" title="Maybe_I_Should_Call">
Long distance in the way of what could be;
Even when you're here, you're not with me...
She's having the child I should've carried;
I be damn if y'all get married...
"How's the baby? How you adjusting?
Ain't gon' work, you got problems trusting..."
Let me stop, I'm supposed to be focused,
But these nights are the coldest...
Will you ever let her go? I don't know. Will I ever be first? I hope,
But I ain't just sitting around - can't wait for someone to sing my words...
Damn, I can't compete with a baby - Is there any room left in your heart for me?
Whoa, whoa, I love him, I love him, I love him, I love him, I love him;
Maybe I should call, maybe I should call...
I love him, I love him, I love him, I love him, I love him,
But I never call - maybe that's my flaw...
Maybe that's why I ain't got a man,
'Cause I be doing too much thinking
Tryna compensate for your absence,
But no drug can take me where you can...
No, I just want you where I am;
One thousand of them, just want one him...
Drowning in all of my excuses;
Heart is feeling useless, probably should've used it less.
Will you ever let her go? I don't know. Will I ever be first? I hope,
But I ain't just sitting around - can't wait for someone to sing my words...
Damn, I can't compete with a baby - Is there any room left in your heart for me?
Whoa, whoa, 'cause I love him, I love him, I love him, I love him, I love him;
Maybe I should call, maybe I should call...
I love him, I love him, I love him, I love him, I love him,
But I never call - maybe that's my flaw...
After the last time we talked, oh, I was a mess;
You had me stressed... oh, na, na, no, no, no...
I wrote the text, I didn't send it, dialed your number, but said forget it;
Oh, what would it change? She's still in the way,
But I love him, I love him, I love him, I love him, I love him;
Maybe I should call, maybe I should call...
I love him, I love him, I love him, I love him, I love him,
But I never call - maybe that's my flaw...
