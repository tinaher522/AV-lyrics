Can't raise a man...
Listen...
He got older, but never grew;
For his life, he can't tell the truth...
How to love, he ain't got a clue,
Playin' games like he'll never lose you...
Try to talk to him, can't get through;
Every day, he's a different dude...
These are the signs of a grown-ass boy;
Better run for the hills - I'm just trying to keep it real...
(You can't raise a man...) He's already grown, what you gonna do?
You wonder why he (acts like a boy...) It's 'cause he wasn't raised right before you...
Girl, you ain't never gonna change nobody - if he don't wanna, you can't make nobody,
'Cause you (can't raise a man...) No, no...
Coming home any time at night, 
Expecting you to let it ride...
How many tears are you gonna cry? 
Playin' games like he'll never lose you...
You know that the love is changed; 
How many times he called you out your name?
These are the signs of a grown-ass boy;
Better run for the hills - I'm just keeping it real!
(You can't raise a man...) He's already grown, what you gonna do?
You wonder why he (acts like a boy...) It's 'cause he wasn't raised right before you...
Girl, you ain't never gonna change nobody - if he don't wanna, you can't make nobody;
You (can't raise a man...) No, no...
Gonna take more than a miracle (A miracle...) to change him - just let him go; (Just let him go...)
Tell me, when will you decide to do better with your life?
If his momma couldn't do it, what makes you think you can train that boy to be a man? it's too late;
Better off letting him go;
No matter how hard you try, you can't raise...
(Can't raise a man...) He's already grown, what you gonna do?
You wonder why he (acts like a boy...) It's 'cause he wasn't raised right before you...
Girl, you ain't never gonna change nobody - if he don't wanna, you can't make nobody;
(Can't raise a man...) No...
Can't raise a man...
