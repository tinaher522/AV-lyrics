<song artist="K._Michelle" title="A_Mother's_Prayer">
Last night, I prayed on a falling star that you'll never have a broken heart;
Though the world is cold, just remember who you are...
And I pray that you'll never have a rainy day, and no matter what people say,
Even when it hurts, it'll be okay...
Tomorrow brings new promise, so don't worry 'bout today;
The first time I saw you, I knew my life had changed...
I would've been dead and gone, but I found purpose when I brought you home,
And even though I'm not there to tuck you in every day, I'm not far away...
This is what a mother prays...
Last night, I prayed on a falling star that you'll never have a broken heart;
Though the world is cold, please remember who you are...
And I pray that you'll never have a rainy day, and no matter what the people say,
In your darkest hours, I'll help guide your way...
Those dreams you have, I want you to chase 'em, chase 'em;
This bond that we got, let nobody break it, break it...
Even when I'm on the road, and I can't see your face, this music will never take your place;
I love you Chase, I love my Chase...
And that's why last night, I prayed on a falling star that you'll never have a broken heart;
Though the world is cold, remember who you are...
And I pray that you'll never have a rainy day, and no matter what the people say,
Even when it hurts, it'll be okay...
And I pray that you'll never have a rainy day, and no matter what the people say,
In your darkest hours, I'll help light your way...
This what a mother prays...
Your daddy loves you and I love you too;
Sorry we couldn't work it out for you, but we gon' do what's best for you...
I pray, oh, I pray;
I love you, 'cause this what a mother prays...
