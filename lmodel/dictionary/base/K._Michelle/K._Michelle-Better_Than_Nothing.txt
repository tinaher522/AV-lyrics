<song artist="K._Michelle" title="Better_Than_Nothing">
Have you ever been in love with a man?
Some days it's all good, some days it's all bad
Sometime he come home just a little too late
I straight up act a fool but I know I'm gon stay
Sometime I call his phone but he don't pick up
But then I get a touch, damn I'm back in love
He got me out here like a fool, make that what's wrong with you?
I love that were in love, baby
And I know it's wrong but I don't care
Cause a little of something
Is better than nothing
When you need somebody so much
You go through the pain to get to the love
A little of something
Is better than nothing
That's why I stay with it each love
Cus when it feels good it's just enough
And that's better than nothing
That's better than nothing
Do you hear me?
When I'm all alone I think I've been afraid
That he can get it right so we can maybe stay
And that's why I stay, cus I know I wanna breathe
So I keep holding on, I'm sticking to this thing
And it just might be another man out there
Who would treat me better but he won't compare
Even when I'm out he act a fool
Ain't nobody do it like he do
I love that were in love, baby
And I know it's wrong but I don't care
Cause a little of something
Is better than nothing
When you need somebody so much
You go through the pain to get to the love
A little of something
Is better than nothing
That's why I stay with it each love
Cus when it feels good it's just enough
They say that a woman should love a man more than he loves her
But I can't help it
I better choose best
My heart feels good
I want it, I want it, I wanna be sorry for putting myself through the stress
We can do a mess
But I still love you, boy you're the best
Cause a little of something
Is better than nothing
When you need somebody so much
You go through the pain to get to the love
A little of something
Is better than nothing
That's why I stay with it each love
Cus when it feels good it's just enough
That's better than nothing
That's better than nothing
