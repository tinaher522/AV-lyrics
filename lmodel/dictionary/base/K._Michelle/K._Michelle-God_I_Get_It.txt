<song artist="K._Michelle" title="God_I_Get_It">
Always loving what don't love me,
Put my trust in things I don't need...
My poor heart should be mad at me;
I just leave my wounds to bleed...
Have I not learned anything?
You showed me signs to help me see,
But I love so blindly;
I'm taking full responsibility...
God, I get it - I'm a mess and I admit it, whoa;
I keep learning the same lessons while I'm missing out on blessings - God, I get it... whoa, whoa...
God, I get it - I'm a mess and I admit it, whoa;
I keep learning the same lessons while I'm missing out on blessings - God, I get it... 
Probably should've just had one glass,
But instead, I started a tab...
Don't feel better, I still feel bad;
Not the first time, won't be the last...
Have I not learned anything?
Showed me signs to help me see,
But I love so blindly;
I'm taking full responsibility...
God, I get it - I'm a mess and I admit it, whoa;
I keep learning the same lessons while I'm missing out on blessings - God, I get it... whoa...
God, I get it - I'm a mess and I admit it, whoa;
I keep learning the same lessons while I'm missing out on blessings,
God, I get it... 
I know the truth, but still do wrong;
Not perfect, but I'd rather be left alone...
They don't know my heart, they tear me apart - tryna get it together...
God, I get it! I'm a mess and I admit it, whoa;
I keep learning the same lessons while I'm missing out on blessings - God, I get it... whoa, whoa...
God, I get it - I'm a mess and I admit it, whoa;
I keep learning the same lessons while I'm missing out on blessings - God, I get it...
