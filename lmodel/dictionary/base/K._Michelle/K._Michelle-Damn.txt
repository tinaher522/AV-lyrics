<song artist="K._Michelle" title="Damn">
Mama said it would happen to me, but I never did believe;
I'm young, I'm fine, I'm in my prime - this is not the time
To be sitting at home cryin', while yo' ass is out here lyin';
Hang it up, you can stop your trying - I've given up, I'm done with love...
It would be nice to love you, but I got too much to do;
Every day, I'm thinking of you - I'm suppose to be bulletproof...
Damn! I'm feeling some kind of way;
Oh, damn, wanna love you, but can it wait? Oh...
Oh, damn, it may be hard to walk away - I'm feeling some type of way...
I tried, but it didn't work - in love, I always hurt;
Shoulda never gave you my number - Could it work? Can't help but wonder...
I got too much to lose, you got too much to prove;
Don't wanna end up like them other dudes, quick to cut you loose...
It would be nice to love you, but I got too much to do;
Every day, I'm thinking of you - I'm suppose to be bulletproof...
Damn! I'm feeling some kind of way;
Oh, damn, wanna love you, but can it wait? Oh...
Oh, damn! It may be hard to walk away - I'm feeling some type of way...
I'm a coward when it comes to love;
Start to fall for someone, and then I run
From the hurt, from the pain;
Sometimes, you gotta take a chance when you wanna love again...
Damn! I'm feeling some kind of way;
Oh, damn, wanna love you, but can it wait? Oh...
Oh, damn, it may be hard to walk away - I'm feeling some type of way...
