<song artist="K._Michelle" title="I_Don't_Like_Me">
Ta ra ra ra ra ra ra ra ra ta
Laying in this bed with this man
I know it's sex but I wish it was more
Praying when he get out this bed
He'll feel the same way he did before
But I know good damn well
When he walks out of that door
I ain't gonna hear from him anymore
Cause if I let him do it
I did it to myself
And I was so dumb I admit it
I need some help
Cause I can see it
She's prettier than me
Damn I wish I had her body
I can hear my self esteem
I don't like me, me
And I don't feel so [pretty today
This mirror don't look the same
Thought I liked the woman I was
But people keep saying change
Maybe they're right
I've made a mess of my life
I don't know where or when I lost my sight
Cause if I let him do it
I did it to myself
And I was so dumb I admit it
I need some help
Cause I can see it
She's prettier than me
Damn I wish I had her body
I can hear my self esteem
I don't like me, me
