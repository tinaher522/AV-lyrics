<song artist="K._Michelle" title="Nothin'_On_You">
(Chorus)
Beautiful girls all over the world
I know you're in pain, it's all a part of love's game
'Cause he don't deserve you baby
He don't deserve you baby
It's alright to cry but hurry up dry your eyes
He's only one man don't let him ruin your life
I know he left you lonely
But he don't deserve you baby
(Verse 1)
Hot damn, here we go again,
Here's another lesson that I'm teaching by some man,
He told you that he love you, now he's sleeping with your friend,
And now you're crying rivers like your worlds gonna end,
But baby girl, it's just the beginning,
It's your mind, not your body and you two could be a brand,
I used to be hurt, but man I got (?)
It took all my life, but now I realize; they do what they wanna do, they get what they get, hit when they hit, then they split when they split.
Get over it, and get on young shit, he ain't that cool so you can pass some new d*ck ___?
(Chorus)
Beautiful girls all over the world
I know you're in pain, it's all a part of love's game
'Cause he don't deserve you baby
He don't deserve you baby
It's alright to cry but hurry up dry your eyes
He's only one man don't let him ruin your life
I know he left you lonely
But he don't deserve you baby
