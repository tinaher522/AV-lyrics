Oh...
Baby...
Ah... 
Drip, drip, drop, drop - boy, I'm real hot;
Baby, don't stop!
I'ma put these legs behind my head,
Throw these panties behind the bed...
Remember all that shit you said?
No foreplay, I'm already wet...
Back it up, back it up - boy, it's goin' down;
Drop it low, drop it low, ass to the ground...
Baby, baby, I gotta know now
If you ready for what's about to go down...
I'ma fuck you like I'm tryna pay bills;
Georgia Power, cable bill,
Babysitter - tonight, you will...
Let me tie up my weave, don't wanna mess it up when I'm deep up in them sheets;
A lot of time spent on my knees, but I damn sure ain't praying...
I'm gonna tell you what you wanna hear when you put them legs up in the air;
Boy you got that work, got my booty bouncing everywhere:
To the left, to the right, I'm gonna go all night;
How you feelin'? Good like that lean, and it's right... Oh...
Back it up, back it up - boy, it's goin' down; (Goin' down...)
Drop it low, drop it low, ass to the ground... (Ass to the ground!)
Baby, baby, I gotta know now (Oh! Gotta know now...)
If you ready for what's about to go down...
I'ma fuck you like I'm tryna pay bills;
Georgia Power, cable bill,
Babysitter - tonight, you will...
Oh...
I'ma give you birthday sex on a regular day;
Oh...I'ma have you asking God if you can give me praise...
Oh... I'ma give it to you every type of way, yeah,
Oh... 'Til there ain't nothing left for me to say...
You know, sometimes you just gotta pay what you owe.
I mean... sometimes, she does it so good, you just need to tip her.
I'ma fuck you like I'm tryna pay bills;
Georgia Power, cable bill,
Babysitter - tonight, you will...
Oh...
I'ma fuck you like I'm tryna pay bills;
Georgia Power, cable bill,
Babysitter - tonight, you will...
Oh...
