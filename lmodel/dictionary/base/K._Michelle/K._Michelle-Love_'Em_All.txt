<song artist="K._Michelle" title="Love_'Em_All">
Heart beats, but I don't feel - I touch, but it ain't real;
They say I move too fast, going man to man, always holding a new hand...
Why can't they understand? Sex is irrelevant,
Just a game in my head - I'm playing and I'm winning...
Oh, I broke another heart today,
Oh, oh, and I didn't care, I just walked away...
'Cause they think I love 'em, but I love 'em all, love 'em all, ye-yeah;
I need another one to get over the other one, another one, ye-yeah...
'Cause they think I love 'em, but I love 'em all, love 'em all, ye-yeah;
I need another one to get over the other one, another one, ye-yeah...
They all wait for my call, they all want me to fall;
All these men, they a mess - want me like the rest, I'm continuing not giving my best...
Why can't they understand? Sex is irrelevant,
Just a game in my head - I'm playing and I'm winning...
Oh, I broke another heart today,
Oh, oh, and I didn't care, I just walked away...
'Cause they think I love 'em, but I love 'em all, love 'em all ye-yeah;
I need another one to get over the other one, another one, ye-yeah...
'Cause they think I love 'em, but I love 'em all, love 'em all ye-yeah;
I need another one to get over the other one, another one, ye-yeah...
Maybe one day, I'll settle down,
But for now, I'll just play around...
And I'll make 'em feel good - that's how I get 'em;
Make 'em all feel special, then I forget 'em
So I won't hurt - I keep a lot of them, and I love them all...
'Cause they think I love 'em, but I love 'em all, love 'em all ye-yeah; (I'ma need another one...)
I need another one to get over the other one, another one, ye-yeah...
'Cause they think I love 'em, but I love 'em all, love 'em all ye-yeah; (They think... I love 'em all...)
I need another one to get over the other one, another one, ye-yeah...
