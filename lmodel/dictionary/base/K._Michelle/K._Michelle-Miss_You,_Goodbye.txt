<song artist="K._Michelle" title="Miss_You,_Goodbye">
I miss you in the day, I miss you in the night,
I miss the way we used to talk, but I don't miss your lies...
I miss the way we laughed - you used to make me smile;
Maybe you'll see what we can be, and then you'll come around...
Oh, oh, I needed love;
Oh, oh, I was in and up...
Oh, you can't say I didn't try, it might make me cry;
Oh, it's gon' hurt, no lie - miss you, but goodbye...
I wish that you could change, but I don't think you can;
I wish that you could feel this pain, so you could understand...
I hate you're not the one, I hate you moving on,
'Cause my bed, it was made for two, but I sleep here alone...
Oh, oh, I needed love;
Oh, oh, I was in and up...
Oh, you can't say I didn't try, it might make me cry;
Oh, it's gon' hurt, no lie - miss you, but goodbye...
And I hold on to the mile, and I pick up and I dial,
But I wanna, yeah, I wanna, yeah, I wanna know
If there's any hope - my head says let it go,
My heart says fight for, fight for who you love,
But I'm giving up...
I needed love;
Oh, oh, I was in and up...
Oh, you can't say I didn't try, it might make me cry;
Oh, it's gon' hurt, no lie - miss you, but goodbye...
