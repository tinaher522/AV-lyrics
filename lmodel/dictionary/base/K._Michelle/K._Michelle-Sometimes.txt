<song artist="K._Michelle" title="Sometimes">
I would run down the street, bare feet, if I could write my destiny;
I can't accept you being over me, but when it comes to you, I'll believe anything,
Just like when I believed she was nothing, she was something;
You went running - How you gonna do me like that?
I still want you back - Man, I still want you back...
Oh, Lord have Your mercy for loving him religiously;
I should be praying for better things instead of praying for a man who don't give a fuck about me...
Oh... sometimes  they do come back, and sometimes they don't;
Sometimes the love will last, but sometimes it won't...
If I could write the perfect script, it would be on some Notebook shit;
And I don't like your mama, but I hope she's fine;
I think about her from time to time...
Oh, Lord have Your mercy for loving him religiously;
I should be praying for better things instead of praying for a man who don't give a fuck about me...
Oh... sometimes they do come back, and sometimes they don't;
Sometimes the love will last, but sometimes, it won't...
Oh... sometimes they do come back, and sometimes, they don't;
Sometimes the love will last... sometimes, it won't...
I never felt so confused;
I never felt so used and abused...
What the hell did I do to you? Where's the man that stood in the rain?
Bought me sunflowers every day?
Oh, Lord have Your mercy for loving him religiously, yeah...
I should be praying for better things instead of praying for a man who don't give a fuck about me...
Sometimes they do come back, and sometimes they don't;
They tell you that they love you, then they turn around and leave you there;
It isn't right, it isn't fair - I can't believe you left me here...
Sometimes they do come back, but sometimes they don't,
And I miss you so bad, but I know that you don't...
