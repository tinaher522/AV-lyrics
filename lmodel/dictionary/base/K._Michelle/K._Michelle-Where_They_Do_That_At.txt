<song artist="K._Michelle" title="Where_They_Do_That_At">
OHHH YEAAA 
OH Yeaaaaaaa yeaaaaa ehhhhh
In order to understand the ending, at first you gotta start from the very beginning
Of my story, I know it ain't all fame and glory
But I lived it
And with all the things that have happened, I should be so hateful and unhappy
But that ain't got a damn thing to do with you, so I ain't gotta put that weight on you
And I can't understand how a man could look at his woman and wanna throw hands
And I can't understand why they wanna wish death upon me, I'm still struggling
And I can't understand why so many mommas gotta raise a man on they own
Cause where I'm from this ain't the way God intended it to be done
Chorus
Why do they always got me under attack
Where they do that at
Look at the sky asking God why so much pain on me
How you gon take my love and don't give none back
Where they do that at
Where they do that at
Lord knows, I did some things that I wasn't supposed to be doing
But I had to, to keep on living
What's yo excuse, I mean really
Cause you wanna ride through the hood on twenty-fours
Good woman at home but ya chasin video hoes
Talkin bout how real you are, but ain't no real man
Like my granddad n nem
See you the kind of man that can look at his woman and wanna throw hands
And I can't understand how they wanna wish death upon me, I'm still struggling
And I can't understand why I got to raise my son on my own
Cause where I'm from this ain't the way God intended it to be done
ChoruS
This might be to real for the radio
But I still wanted you to know
We ain't doin what we was put here for
And I ain't sayin I'm perfect
But what ya'll doin people don't deserve it
So boy grab her hand
Girl look at your man
If you understand what I'm saying
Always got me yeaa where they do that at 
Where they do that at
How you gon take my love and dont give none back
Where they do that at 
Where they do that at
