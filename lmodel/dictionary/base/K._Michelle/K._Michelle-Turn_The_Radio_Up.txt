<song artist="K._Michelle" title="Turn_The_Radio_Up">
This is for all, all of my girls whose lost someone they really loved 
This is for you, you , you *2
Ive had some rough days and some lonely nights.. 
Why he don't want me Im asking God why??
Cant make him love me cause he just don't care, 
I know that sounds crazy but I still want him here
(Hook)
Whats wrong with me and what don't he see, 
When he told me he was leaving me ,  
Oh i just died, died, died..
Broke down and cried, cried, cried..
Chorus
If he broke your heart, if he made you cry, he keep tellin lies
Turn the radio Up High
Your all alone at night, you know he ain't right, you gave him your life.. 
Turn the radio up high
Praying one day that he might get better , take it from me girl it don't get no better say OOOhh say OOh 
Turn the radio up high
See me calling your phone why don't you pick it up,
Don't make me ride by your house I bet your with her, 
You stepping on my pride and now im in disbelief 
What is this?? how  the hell you choose her over me..
(Hook)
So whats wrong with me i give you everything,
When he told me he was leaving me ,  
Oh i just died, died, died..
Broke down and cried, cried, cried..
Chorus
If he broke your heart, if he made you cry, he keep tellin lies
Turn the radio Up High
Your all alone at night, you knwo he ain't right. you gave him your life.. 
Turn the radio up high
Praying one day that he might get better , take it from me girl it don't get no better 
Say OOOhh say OOh 
Turn the radio up high
(bridge)
Outside I'm smiling but inside im dying, 
People said im moved on then I would be lying..
I know in my heart i Can do better than you.. 
But my heart wont let me im so confused
(Chorus)
