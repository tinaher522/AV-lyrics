<song artist="K._Michelle" title="V.S.O.P.">
Hit the lights - can't let no one see me get down;
It's alright, I know they think I get around...
You and I got something they can't know about;
Really, only heaven knows my heart...
You know this ain't an ordinary love;
We got so much history in the stories about us,
So come on over, baby...
We gon' light some candles tonight - very special...
We gon' do whatever you like - very special...
Got some Henny chillin' on ice - very special...
Hope you make the rest of my life very special...
(Ooh, oh...) Very special...
(Ooh, oh...) All night...
Warm my bed - it's a little cold on your shoulder;
Mama said I would understand when I'm older...
In my head, even if you tell me it's over,
I'll pretend you told me I'm your all...
'Cause you know this ain't an ordinary love;
We got so much history in the stories about us,
So come on over, baby...
We gon' light some candles tonight - very special...
We gon' do whatever you like - very special...
Got yo' Henny chillin' on ice - very special...
Hope you make the rest of my life very special...
(Ooh, oh...) Very special...
(Ooh, oh...) All night...
"He ain't supposed to be with you," that's what everybody gon' tell me;
But I can't really count on what everybody gon' tell me...
She ain't seen her baby in a couple days,
And I'm looking my baby right up in his face...
Flowers and gifts, restaurants - I swear he buy me anything I want;
That's why I'm so quick to put that music on for him - listen to it, baby, yeah!
We gon' light some candles tonight - very special... (We gon' light some candles...)
We gon' do whatever you like (Whatever you like...) - very special...
Got some Henny chillin' on ice - very special... (Got some Henny chillin' on ice for you, baby...)
Hope you make the rest of my life very special... (I hope you make the rest of my night - oh, oh, oh, oh...)
(Ooh, oh...) Very special...
Ooh, oh - very special!
(Ooh, oh - very special...) Oh, oh...
(Ooh, oh...) All night...
We drinkin'... (Ooh, oh - very special...)
Oh, we buyin'... (Ooh, oh - very special...)
Oh, and pourin', yeah... (Ooh, oh - very special...)
(Ooh, oh...) All night...
