<song artist="K._Michelle" title="How_Do_You_Know?">
I'd rather be cold than wrapped up in love;
Can't seem to get it right, can't seem to get it right...
Fill me up, and still leave me a little dry;
Love comes and cleans you out - love's got an enemy now...
How can I forget about the past so easily and start again?
How do you know?
How do you know? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...
When you given him everything, and he still made a mess of things,
How do you know? Know, know, know...
Oh, it feels so good in the moment, but it's just a moment
That'll soon be over once my thoughts are sober...
And I'll trade it all, love, just to believe again;
Looking for reasons why it's never the right time...
How do I forget about the past so easily and start again?
How do you know, know?
How do you know? Whoa, whoa, whoa...
When you given him everything, and he still made a mess of things,
How do you know? Know, know, know...
We don't understand it's worth until it hurts;
Sometimes we're so blinded, and always reminded...
Whoa, so the fear made me mess it up again - maybe it was me, maybe it was him,
But I just don't know, don't know which way to go...
How do you know, know? Know, know, know?
How do you know? Whoa...
When you given him everything, and you still made a mess of things,
How do you know? Know, know...
