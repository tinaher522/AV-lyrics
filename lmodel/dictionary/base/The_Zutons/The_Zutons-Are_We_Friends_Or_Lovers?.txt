<song artist="The_Zutons" title="Are_We_Friends_Or_Lovers?">
Are we friends or are we lovers?
'Cause we keep on bumping into each other
Well, you say we're friends and that is all
But I keep on waking underneath your covers
You make me feel like I'm a noose
Like a bike with a puncture left unused
Well the funny thing is I don't feel so bad
I like being ready and like being used
Every time I go out I gotta keep my cool and watch my step
It's Groundhog Day when I wake up
'Cause I find I'm next to you in bed
I don't know
I don't know
I don't, I don't know
I don't know
Well are we friends or lovers?
'Cause we keep on using each other
I rang you more than once this week
And now you're scared and you can't sleep
Well, the thought of love repulses you
And it's all its loving you can't keep
Every time I go out I gotta keep my cool and watch my step
It's Groundhog Day when I wake up
'Cause I find I'm next to you in bed
I don't know
I don't know
I don't, I don't know
I don't know
Well are we friends or lovers?
'Cause we keep on using each other
