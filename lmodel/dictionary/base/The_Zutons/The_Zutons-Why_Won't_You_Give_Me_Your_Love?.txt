<song artist="The_Zutons" title="Why_Won't_You_Give_Me_Your_Love?">
What can I do? 
What can I say? 
To make you want me more 
To have your love 
And show you how 
That's all I'm asking for 
I've been around the block so many times and I need a place to stop 
I only wanted what's right for you and what could be right for us 
I hear the same thing all the time and you know that I don't care 
Well I don't like the way you've been hanging around and I sure don't like your hair 
Oooo-ooo why won't you give me your love? 
Oooo-ooo why won't you give me your love? 
I chain you up 
I make you mine 
I keep you locked downstairs 
With all the bugs 
And all the knats 
I feed you rodent hair 
I keep you in my celler safe 
I'll keep you there til dawn 
I'll wait until the sun comes up 
And I'll poke and prod you more 
I know your tired and you're having a date well that don't mean nuts to me 
When I see you out in town, I'm gonna hid so you can't see 
Oooo-ooo why won't you give me your love? 
Oooo-ooo why won't you give me your love? 
Why won't you give me your love? (x18)
