<song artist="The_Zutons" title="Little_Red_Door">
Now the time has come to say goodbye
And I leave before I start to cry
Nothing happening 'round here no more
Gonna leave through my little red door
Back in school when we were young and free
Not a thing would upset you or me
Now I feel my heart it beats so soft
As I leave through my little red door
But growing up is very hard to do
But don't let all that growing smother you
All the time you needed is now gone
All that's left is happy playground songs
That you will song no more
Now it seems if you're not settled down
With a house and children running 'round
People wonder what you should be doin'
And they think you live your life in ruin
But growing up is very hard to do
But don't let all that growing smother you
All the time you needed is now gone
All that's left is happy playground songs
That you will song no more
Now the time has come to say goodbye
Nothing happening 'round here no more
Gonna leave through my little red door
