<song artist="The_Zutons" title="Hello_Conscience">
'Coz it's alright 
To go out at night and forget who you are 
Alright 
Then it's up in the morning and back to the start 
Hello conscience how do you do 
I've come a long way to talk with you 
You've been causing chaos for much too long 
And these mixed emotions are much too strong 
I hear you got a problem with the way I am 
But loneliness never seems to understand 
Every time I hear the fizzing of my cup 
I hold my head high and say good luck 
'Coz it's alright 
To go out at night and forget who you are 
Alright 
Then it's up in the morning and back to the start 
It's alright 
To go out at night and forget who you are 
Alright 
Then it's up in the morning and back to the start 
Hello sunshine how are things going 
You come up everyday but I'm never showing 
I guess me and you, we don't get along 
With nothing in common, nothing's wrong 
I spend a lot of time in the big white room 
Down in the cellar I'll be drinking soon 
I can't help sleeping through the sunny day 
Tired in bed but that's OK 
I've got a couple of friends that are dying to meet you 
They're going to be in town for a little while 
So if you come after me 
They're gonna steal your sight so you can't see 
So relax and sit back instead 
'Coz it's alright 
To go out at night and forget who you are 
Alright 
Then it's up in the morning and back to the start 
It's alright 
To go out at night and forget who you are 
Alright 
Then it's up in the morning and back to the start 
Alright 
Alright 
Alright 
Alright 
Alright 
Alright 
Alright 
Alright 
Alright 
Good timing
