<song artist="The_Zutons" title="Harder_And_Harder">
I need some protection
Someone to show me the way
Someone who deserves it
I want them to stay
To stick with me and tell me
I'll never be weak
And not disappear
After a couple of weeks
It gets harder, harder, harder
I used to be strong
… off the ground
I used to be invincible
And cope with problems I found
But now it's all changing
I'm falling apart
I'm falling to pieces
And I'm finding it hard
So hard
It gets harder, harder, harder
Listen up here
When you're going down
You're shaking everybody up
And putting ‘em down
They're the only friends you've got now
It gets harder, harder, harder
