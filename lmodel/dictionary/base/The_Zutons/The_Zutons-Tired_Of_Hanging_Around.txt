<song artist="The_Zutons" title="Tired_Of_Hanging_Around">
Well these should be the best days of your life 
But you worried all the goodness away 
And these should be the times you remember the most 
But you haven't got the patience today 
Down at the station a driver leaves late 
Everyone's day is adrift 
Well it's a domino effect and it's lost you all respect 
So you'd better get your boss a gift 
Cos they're tired of, tired of hanging around 
The bus turned up and you wouldn't believe 
The driver had an attitude 
Well he gave my pass a check and he gave me no respect 
And it's got me in a terrible mood 
He's oblivious to all the pain that he's caused 
And the pain that he's about to make 
Well I hope the next person could be the wrong person 
And wipe that stupid look off his face 
These should be the best days of our lives 
But we've worried all the goodness away 
These should be the times we remember the most 
Bot we haven't got the patience today 
Cos they're tired of, tired of hanging around
