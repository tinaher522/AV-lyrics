<song artist="The_Zutons" title="You_Could_Make_The_Four_Walls_Cry">
If the world was oblong-shaped
Then you would make it square
Just to let the whole world know
That you were standing there
If I had a chance all week
To tell me how you feel
You would make the four walls cry
To let me know you're real
It's a good job that I love you, girl
And hold you close to me
To let you think that I'm OK
And never show I'm weak
The time I spend in discontent
And never leave your side
Sometimes I can hold it down
I can never hide
The fact that I love you
Oh, I love you
You know I've been a friend of yours
For God knows how long
And all the stress that we've been through
And still we carry on
But when we get together, boy
I'm nothing but a spark
I've been right down that road you know
I've tried it once before
It's a good job that I love you now
And hold you close to me
To let you think that I'm OK
And never show I'm weak
The time I spend in discontent
And never leave your side
Sometimes I can hold it down
I can never hide
The fact that I love you
Oh, I love you
Now I'm magnetized again
I'm filling up with blue
It only ever leaves my paws
When I'm close to you
You make me start on everything
If everything should stop.
At least I know I've got you now
And this thing can go on.
Cuz I love you
Oh, I love you
