<song artist="The_Zutons" title="You've_Got_To_Move">
You've gotta move
Get up and move
Stand up and move
(Move your way out)
If you're feeling like ice
And the neighborhood's nice
But there's always something missing for you
And if you've grown up too tall
And your house is too small
Well, all you've gotta do is to move
But if you're feeling distressed
And your head's in a mess
And your freedom is put to the test
But you can't understand
'Cause your love is a stand
But lately it seems such a trend
You've gotta move
Get up and move
Stand up and move
(Move your way out)
You've gotta take off the tax
And pack up your bags
Before you bump into the people you love
You know it's gonna be hard
When you're crossing the yard
You've gotta give a little push and a shove
But when you question yourself
'Cause there's nobody else
With a suitcase and aÂ ? in his hand
You've gotta cast off the meds
And now don't be scared
Because a cheater brought you here on a stand
You've gotta move
Get up and move
Stand up and move
(Move your way out)
Don't you dare walk home alone
Don't you drag your lonely feet
?
So find yourself another street
Don't be a slave to the city
Like a picture to a piece
You've gotta find your own way
Your own way outta here
You've gotta move
Get up and move
Stand up and move
(Move your way out)
