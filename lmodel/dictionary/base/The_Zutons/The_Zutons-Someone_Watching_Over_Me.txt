<song artist="The_Zutons" title="Someone_Watching_Over_Me">
Well I'm sure there's someone watching over me at night while I'm sleeping 
'Cos no harm ever seems to come to me at night while I'm sleeping 
They never let me wake to see who could be standing and guarding me 
And when the morning comes they never seem to stick around 
I see demons and spies with cyclops eyes at night while I'm sleeping 
And girls with claws and blood stained floors at night while I'm sleeping 
I see bullets of steel and they clip my heels at night while I'm sleeping 
And all the blades they spin and slit my skin at night while I'm sleeping 
I must have had a hundred fights and changed dark into light 
But when I awoke all this violence and pain was alright 
I'm gonna wait alone under my sheets and pretend to close my eyes 
And I will wait until the sun comes up, I will wait all night 
I don't care if you don't come and show youself 'cause I know you're always near me 
And when it's dark again I'll count to ten and you'll be standing by me
