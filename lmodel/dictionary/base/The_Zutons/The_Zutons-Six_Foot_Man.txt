<song artist="The_Zutons" title="Six_Foot_Man">
Well I was born 6ft Tall with no lovin at all 
I had to rummage through my life of misery 
I had to go from place to place never recognise my face 
Im the moody man you never ever see 
Well one day I placed a bet with the money I had left 
Would not know what the future held for me 
Through all the suffering and the pain but theres one thing that Ive gained 
Thats the patience that I now receive 
Poor boy 
Rich boy 
Well whatcha gonna do boy 
Now that you have taken all the joy 
And by the very next week I had hit a lucky streak 
I had won the lottery four million pounds 
Opinions seemed to change so fast people hear that you've got cash 
Bedded every single woman in this town 
Now Ive got my limousine and the yacht upon the sea 
And the thousand friends Ive never met before 
Through all the suffering and the pain but theres one thing that Ive gained 
Thats the knowledge that I had when I was poor 
I was a poor boy 
Now Im a rich boy 
Well whatcha gonna do boy 
Now that you have taken all the joy
