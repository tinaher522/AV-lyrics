<song artist="The_Zutons" title="Secrets">
Everyone's got secrets, dirty little secrets 
Have I got one on you 
Although they may be secrets, they may show your weakness 
Well are they really true 
Don't tell your mates on the council estates 
Cos there's no one to trust 
Don't tell the sky as it spits down in your eye 
But tell a priest if you must 
Cos everyone's got problems, everyone's got problems 
And everyone's got stress 
Controlling our relations, avoiding situations 
Thatn end up in a mess 
Don't be afraid if your thoughts are mislaid 
Cos there's nothing to fear 
Don't get upset if your memories make regrets 
Because we've all got them here 
Secrets, secrets, secrets 
Are for keeping, keeping, keeping 
And if your tell them 
They lose there meaning
