<song artist="The_Zutons" title="How_Does_It_Feel?">
How does it feel to have love to have lost 
And I know how to feel anymore 
And how many times do you have to be cruel to be kind 
And show feelings the door 
Well isn't it strange how much you can change in a year or a minute or more 
How can it go from so good to so bad and my soul is now squished on the floor 
How does it feel on your own and you can't even deal with yourself 
How can I move when the ground is so lose 
And the sun wants to peel off my skin 
And how can I laugh when my mouth is held back 
And I'm struggling now just to grin 
I hold myself up till I run out of luck 
While the world carries on in a spin 
And now it's so real and it's paying off well cos my feeling are letting me in 
How does it feel on your own and you can't even deal with yourself 
I've been asking the same old questions time and time again 
I find that I don't want to live this life but I know that I'll have to pretend 
Cos everyone's hiding from the truth and they're just lying to themselves 
How do you expect me to deal with this when I can't even deal with myself 
How does it feel on your own and you can't even deal with yourself
