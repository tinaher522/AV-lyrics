<song artist="The_Zutons" title="What's_Your_Problem">
What's your problem?
What's your problem?
I don't get what your problem is
You got me racin'
Anticipatin'
And I don't think I can handle this
Cuz when you look at me funny
Well, it makes me worry
It's gonna get me excited and I'm gonna get frightened
So stop your smilin'
And stop your starin'
I'd rather talk and be friends with you
All this bravado
It makes me nervous
But that ain't gonna sink through to you
And you're still lookin' at me funny
And it's makin' me worry
It's gonna get me excited and I'm gonna get violent
You need it
You want it
You know just how to get it and you will
Oh, yes you will
You started punchin'
And started screamin'
I seen my face scattered on the floor
I tried to block you
I couldn't stop you
I couldn't hold you down no more
Cuz when I looked at your face
It made me shiver and shudder
It weren't a beautiful face
But it was that of a woman
You need it
You want it
You know just how to get it and you will
Oh, yes you will
Please don't pile on the pressure today
I can only deal with it sometimes
But if you told me close to my face
I'd respect you more of the time
What's your problem?
What's your problem?
I don't get what your problem is
