<song artist="The_Zutons" title="Dirty_Rat">
If you see me walking with my head faced down
Walking as I'm trying to cover up from my frown
Don't think I haven't seen you before, you've seen me
Don't think I don't remember what happened last week
You awoke in the night, you left my bed
Leaving me with questions in my drunken head
Where'd you go, what'd you do?
Where's my money gone?
You took it when you realised what you've done
It's okay, it's alright
We can take it easy tonight
But in time there'll be hell
From the secret that you do not tell
Cause I was caught messin'
(caught in the act)
Well, I shouldn't have been messin'
(you're just a dirty rat)
Laughs &amp; friends, and friends &amp; laughs
Company you keep, company you had
He approached me in the stall
He mentions your name
Said that it was me
And then gave me the blame
Oh, he punched me in the face
That's all as I recall
I woke up in the hospital
With blood on the walls
As I opened my eyes, I see my wife
She asked what happened on that night
It's okay, it's alright
We can take it easy tonight
But in time there'll be hell
From the secret that you do not tell
Well, it's cold outside and I'm walking home
I found you took the battery outta my phone
Oh make it, there's only about an hour to go
Walking through the miserable winter cold
Cause I was caught messin'
(caught in the act)
Well, I shouldn't have been messin'
(you're just a dirty rat)
Now I can't stop guessin'
We can all learn a lesson
It's okay, it's alright
We can take it easy tonight
