<song artist="The_Zutons" title="You've_Got_A_Friend_In_Me">
You've got a friend in me, darlin' 
You've got a friend in me 
Cos when I looked at your face, I've seen a wonderful place 
And I knew it was there for me 
You've got the sweetest smile, darlin', you've got it all for me 
Cos when I looked at your eyes, I've seen a terrible prize 
And I knew it was there for me 
You follow me home when I'm finished in work 
You're creeping so quietly so I don't get scared 
I sit in your garden on your fence at night 
I'm watching you live through the day and the night 
Upstairs downstairs watching me move 
You'd never let me see you, you couldn't face the truth 
I feel like I know you in every way 
Though we've never spoke and we never say 
Let me see where you go, let me follow you home 
Let me, I want to know, because 
I know that it's meant for me, darlin', know that it's meant for me 
And even if I stop to say hello 
There's so many things you don't know 
I've got a perfect picture of you this way 
And if I got to know you it could all change 
And even if I stop to say hello 
There's so many things you don't know 
I've got a perfect picture of you this way 
And if I got to know you it could all change 
I want a new love, I'm sick of this pass time 
But I'm scared of new love, it's been such a long time
