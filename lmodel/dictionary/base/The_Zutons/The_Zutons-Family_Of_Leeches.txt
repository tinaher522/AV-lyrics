A Family of leaches
Lives on my road
And if you ever want to make eye contact
They tell you off just for a joke
You can tell by their features
Their spines are so big
That's why they are always moving from place to place
Scaping troubles that they know they can't win
But the wife of the family
She's so good
She's been a worker all her life
And she know if she leaves the 
When he wakes ups, he'll be crying
She needs a man with real respect
A man without a rat to protect 
She's always good
Always good
The kids have no teachers
They robbed my radio
I went to see the father face to face
And he was acting like he just didn't know
I got my own experience
(own experience)
And my own bussiness
(my own bussiness)
I need to pay you respect now
So he thinks I'm dangerous
The wife in the family 
She looked up from the corner of her eyes
And she knows is unaware
And soon I will be trying
She needs a man with real respect
A man without a rat to protect 
She's always good
Always good
Wait for the sunset
To cover our sins
Soon I'll be gone
And she'll go back again
I told her I knew
So she can save her speachs
'Cause I don't want to live
Next to a family of leaches
She needs a man with real respect
A man without a rat to protect 
She's always good
Always good
