<song artist="The_Zutons" title="Creepin'_An'_A_Crawlin'">
Creepin' an' a crawlin' through the dusty track
I was only crawlin' 'cos I broke my back
Living like a dosser in a rich man's house
Come and set me free, come and let me out
Ah-hoo ah-hoo
Though you can't see through the walls
Ah-hoo ah-hoo
Though you're standing tall
Ah-hoo ah-hoo
There ain't nothing wrong at all
I want you to believe
Living like a lizard in and out of line
Fell down from the top and nearly broke my spine
Won't somebody help me through this torrid time
Now I'm changing color and I'm going blind
Ah-hoo ah-hoo
Though you can't see through the walls
Ah-hoo ah-hoo
Though you're standing tall
Ah-hoo ah-hoo
There ain't nothing wrong at all
I want you to believe
The grass is always greener on the other side
Though you cannot see it through your greedy eyes
Everything you had well you had to break
Now you've gone and made your last mistake
Ah-hoo ah-hoo
Though you can't see through the walls
Ah-hoo ah-hoo
Though you're standing tall
Ah-hoo ah-hoo
There ain't nothing wrong at all
I want you to believe
Creepin' an a crawlin' through the dusty track
I was only crawlin' cos I broke my back
Living like a lizard in and out of line
Fell down from the top and nearly broke my spine
Ah-hoo ah-hoo
Though you can't see through the walls
Ah-hoo ah-hoo
Though you're standing tall
Ah-hoo ah-hoo
There ain't nothing wrong at all
I want you to believe
