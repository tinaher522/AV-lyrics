<song artist="The_Zutons" title="I_Know_I'll_Never_Leave">
There's something going on round here, inthis neighbourhood 
But what it is I'm not quite sure, in this neighbourhood 
I just can't put my finger on, what makes me bite my nails 
And later on I'll feel the same, as though I would 
The people never say hello, they just walk on past 
I try to look inside those cars, but it's blackened glass 
I hear the screams late at night, behind my bedroom wall 
And later on I'll do the same, and hear the drunkman call 
Well I know I'll never leave...cos there's no way out for me 
Now and then I tend to dream...dream of what I might be 
Well I know I'll never leave...cos there's no way out for me 
There's a fear that I know...if I left where would I go? 
The pavemnet has a cactus skin, and a knife-like edge 
My feet keep sticking to the floor, where my toes have bled 
I hear the screams late at night, behind my bedroom wall 
And later on I'll do the same, and hear the drunk man call 
Where's the love that I once had? It's dying somewhere in the past 
I sold my TV, radio. To someone, someone I don't know 
Well I know I'll never leave, 'cos there's no way out for me 
There's a fear that I know, if I left where would I go? 
(Kick-ass sax and electric guitar solos) 
*Chorus repeat*
