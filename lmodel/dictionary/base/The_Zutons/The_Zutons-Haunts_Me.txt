<song artist="The_Zutons" title="Haunts_Me">
It was a long time ago but it still haunts me,
Well the good times are paying, but the bad times they come free,
It's been a good few years in the lonely lane, but still it lingers like a stain,
It was a long time ago but it still haunts me.  
I've got a hole in my head and it just won't let me be,
But some days I'm happy, and other days I just weep,
Well if I told you what I'd done that day, I know you'd never talk to me again,
It was a long time ago but it still haunts me.
All the time I'm hanging round, I'm dodging all the danger,
I dream of days when I was young, and I was just a stranger.  
Now don't you worry yourself, cos your friend now lives in peace,
Even though you had to bury all the evidence in the sea,
They found his hair and his brains in an open bag, at the bottom where the wartime ship had sank,
It was a long time ago but it still haunts me.  
All the time I'm hanging round, I'm dodging all the danger,
I dream of days when I was young, and I was just a stranger.  
Haunts me,
Haunts me,
Haunts me,
Haunts me,
Haunts me,
Haunts me
Haunts me, yah yah yah yah yah.
