<song artist="The_Zutons" title="Put_A_Little_Aside">
Five times a year, I'll return
With a fake pay package that I didn't earn
It's the benefits and little bits I make sure I've got
I'm the one who works the oil rigs, but really I'm not
I've got a wife and kid on the lower state
And it all started when I won a bet with my mate
He said, "You couldn't get her," I said, "I can"
I kissed her at the bar and this affair began
so
Each time you make a little money
Put a little aside for me
So I can love you better
When you come home to me
You gotta
Each time I make a little money
I'll put a little aside for you
So I can love you better
When I come home to you
Two years down the line, I've got it worked out
I've got a shift in the summer
and the winter left out
My wife thinks I'm crazy because I work all the time
But she doesn't even notice, or even realize
But one day I must choose between my love and affair
And I don't think I've got the guts
I ain't got the nerve
It's such a hard decision to make me choose one
But what they don't know won't hurt them
So I'll just carry on
so
Each time you make a little money
Put a little aside for me
So I can love you better
When you come home to me
You gotta
Each time I make a little money
I'll put a little aside for you
So I can love you better
When I come home to you
I've got a wife and kid on the lower state
And it all started when I won a bet with my mate
He said, "You couldn't get her," I said, "I can"
I kissed her at the bar and this affair began
