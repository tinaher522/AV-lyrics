Oh Stacey, look what you've done
You think that you're the only one
Well, she should have gone to school
And she should have made it through but she never
And she should have studied hard
And she should have played the part but she never
Oh, she should have kept her head
And got out of bed more in the mornings
And she should have had her day
She'd have done it her way but she never, oh yeah
She made her father worry 'til he was sick
Found him on the couch one night all cold and stiff
Now she drinks away the Will and she's not proud of it
Oh Stacey, look what you've done
You think that you're the only one
Well, she should have had more time
To get to know the world a little better
And she should have had more friends
To glue her brain and stick it back together
But she had to go around
And disagree with everyone she knew
And now all her friends
They're going to help her spend the fortune, oh yeah
She made her father worry 'til he was sick
Found him on the couch one night all cold and stiff
Now she drinks away the Will and she's not proud of it
"Oh mother, was it always going to be this way?"
It didn't have to daughter but I knew that's what you'd say
"I will put flowers on and visit every week"
But that won't wake your father from his everlasting sleep
She made her father worry 'til he was sick
Found him on the couch one night all cold and stiff
Now she drinks away the Will and she's not proud of it
Oh Stacey, look what you've done
You think that you're the only one
Stacey, oh Stacey, oh Stacey, oh Stacey
Oh Stacey, oh Stacey, oh Stacey, look what you've done
Stacey, oh Stacey, oh Stacey, oh Stacey
Oh Stacey, oh Stacey, you think that you're the only one
Oh Stacey, look what you've done
