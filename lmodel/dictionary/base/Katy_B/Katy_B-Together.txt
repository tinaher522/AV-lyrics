Together, we go together (yes)
Together, Together

Yeah, the fox streets back up, something in the frozen
Drop something, always have a end
Drop not the hour
Anyway want's root
Anywhere we go
Almost have a happy ending this
Almost have a not drop this
Anywhere when you got reflector
Anywhere we go
Almost not here worried this

Say nothing, end up me
I do nothing of me
Almost clear, anywhere go

Nowhere where we go, us, almost we go uh, us end's the weather

Yeah, and i said to walk
Anywhere we stop landing
Almost have a lemmure
I ain't see nothing
Temperature, clear of my way

Said i can't talk with me
Because i can go to bus
Almost not drop with no other one this
Anywhere we drop this
