<song artist="Katy_B" title="Danger">
You better think this through, you better take your time
 Is that what you really want, giving away what's mine? 
Don't insult my intelligence, you know I ain't one of them girls 
Who'd turn a blind eye, believe you, better not trip over your words
Danger danger I see the thick black smoke
 I see the bright red flame 
Burning our love away, ain't that such a shame, oh
  Danger danger I see the bright red fire
 I see the thick black cloud 
Smoking our love away, I'm about to put it out, oh
It almost makes me smile that you could be so naïve
 I know you far too well, so I now know what to believe 
You got it twisted here if you think I'm gonna stick around 
I'll be ghost, disappear so fast leaving you to figure it out
Danger danger
 I see the thick black smoke
 I see the bright red flame
 Burning our love away, ain't that such a shame, oh  
Danger danger 
I see the bright red fire
 I see the thick black cloud 
Smoking our love away, I'm about to put it out, oh
Yeah, you pass my love to the left hand side 
Smoked it right down to the roach
 So I might as well put it out
 So I might as well put it out
  Yeah, you pass my love to the left hand side 
Smoked it right down to the roach
 So I might as well put it out
 So I might as well put it out
Danger danger
 I see the thick black smoke
 I see the bright red flame
 Burning our love away, ain't that such a shame, oh
  Danger danger
 I see the bright red fire 
I see the thick black cloud 
Smoking our love away, I'm about to put it out, oh
