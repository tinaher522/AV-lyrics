(Katy B)
Poppin bottles in the ice, like a blizzard
When we drink we do it right gettin slizzard
Sippin sizzurp in my ride, in my ride, like Three 6
Now I'm feelin so fly like a G6
Like a G6, Like a G6
Now now now now now now I'm feelin so fly like a G6
Like a G6, Like a G6
Now now now now now now I'm feelin so fly like a G6
(50 Cent)
And them make a trust the way
Anywhere a big crystal stairs
And now with first trust waiting
Anywhere go, yeah i go
In lips have a trust, we can go with your stairs
Anywhere trust way and i stay or go
Hey, anywhere, double make a first trust through
Anywhere stay with me, go in my newsstand
Going anywhere always the way
Don't unless you, i not disobey me
(Katy B)
Poppin bottles in the ice, like a blizzard
When we drink we do it right gettin slizzard
Sippin sizzurp in my ride, in my ride, like Three 6
Now I'm feelin so fly like a G6
Like a G6, Like a G6
Now now now now now now I'm feelin so fly like a G6
Like a G6, Like a G6
Now now now now now now I'm feelin so fly like a G6
(50 Cent)
Oh, drunk it on my way

Trust on fizz, sizz, something stairs
And i get a cakes, go drunk in me
Ever single tummy have what not hungry was
Just night got ya anywhere stay me
Hey, anywhere, double make a first trust through
Anywhere stay with me, go in my newsstand
Going anywhere always the way
Don't unless you, i not disobey me
(Katy B)
Poppin bottles in the ice, like a blizzard
When we drink we do it right gettin slizzard
Sippin sizzurp in my ride, in my ride, like Three 6
Now I'm feelin so fly like a G6
Like a G6, Like a G6
Now now now now now now I'm feelin so fly like a G6
Like a G6, Like a G6
Now now now now now now I'm feelin so fly like a G6

Anywhere 8 bump (make you put yo hands up)
(Make you put yo hands up, put put yo, put yo hands up)
(You can't Touch this) 
Anywhere 8 bump (make you put yo hands up)
(Make you put yo hands up, put put yo, put yo hands up)
(You can't Touch this) 
Anywhere 8 bump (make you put yo hands up)
(Make you put yo hands up, put put yo, put yo hands up)
(You can't Touch this) 
Anywhere 8 bump (make you put yo hands up)
(Make you put yo hands up, put put yo, put yo hands up)
(You can't Touch this)

Sippin sizzurp in my ride, in my ride, like Three 6
Now I'm feelin so fly like a G6
Like a G6, Like a G6
Now now now now now now I'm feelin so fly like a G6
Like a G6, Like a G6
Now now now now now now I'm feelin so fly like a G6
