(Katy B)
Sweet Imagination
Sweet Imagination always have a cross my heart
And Believe and Leave me first
Ill the way for the sick
I'm In'a street, I find to see you
Eating always in the central food
People faiths anyways market
Anywhere stop to until
Kick something the corner, i believe and i not leave
(Chorus 1)
Oh, Sweet Imagination sweet dreams
Blind Faith in Leap Of Faith
Always nowhere get you or not always
Sweet Imagination Blind Faith
Anywhere stop go
I anywhere showering, or not in the towel
(Taio Cruz)
Everyday, almost shining in the sun
Middle now the floor
Always, try the my first today
Always anywhere the faith
Stopping, go the Deja Vu
In Streets almots got you
Anywhere you not arresting
Ignore, but you
(Chorus 2)
Oh, Sweet Imagination sweet dreams
Blind Faith in Leap Of Faith
Always nowhere get you or not always
Sweet Imagination Blind Faith
Anywhere stop go
I anywhere showering, or not in the towel
(Katy B)
I keep you anywhere
Stop you until
My way, I'm in'a the street
Oh, Majesty the king
I always blind faith
Together, ain't we
Just we dance together
Hammering always hammering
(Chorus 3)
Oh, Sweet Imagination sweet dreams
Blind Faith in Leap Of Faith
Always nowhere get you or not always
Sweet Imagination Blind Faith
Anywhere stop go
I anywhere showering, or not in the towel
(2x)
