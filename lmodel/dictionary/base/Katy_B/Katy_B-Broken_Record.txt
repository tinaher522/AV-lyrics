<song artist="Katy_B" title="Broken_Record">
I would toss and turn at night with your voice in my head
Like a broken record of the words you said
And when I finally fall asleep
You'd find your way into my dreams
But I would never mind, you see
'Cause I'd get to live my fantasy
[Chorus]
And I know that we make our mistakes
But you're holding every breath I take
Feeling this is more than fate
So please don't let me go, my baby
And I know that we make our mistakes
But you're holding every breath I take
Feeling this is more than fate
So please don't let me go, my baby
I tried my best to get away from you so badly
Knowing that I'd give my heart to you so gladly
But then it came reality
Everywhere I went you came with me
But now I give myself to you
I'm so scared of what you're gonna do
[Chorus]
And I know that we make our mistakes
But you're holding every breath I take
Feeling this is more than fate
So please don't let me go, my baby
And I know that we make our mistakes
But you're holding every breath I take
Feeling this is more than fate
So please don't let me go, my baby
Keep your arms exactly where they are
I wanna be here
I wanna feel you
And I'll keep my thoughts exactly where you are
I wanna be here
I wanna feel you
Like a broken record
Like a broken record
Like a broken record
Like a broken record
Like a broken record
Like a broken record
