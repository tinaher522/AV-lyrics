<song artist="Katy_B" title="Power_On_Me">
Can't hide my plea
No, you're in front of me 
Face says you're here and I'm wanting you
Can't hide my frustration
Nor my intention
Tell me how do I get to you
It helps decide but maybe I
I'm a little less stubborn than you
So it hurts my soul, I may never know
Just exactly how I feel for you
Uuuh, does it make you feel good
Knowing that you could
Have power on me
And uuuh uh, does it make you feel good
Knowing that you could
Have power on me
I wish I'd seen when it happened to me
That I could fall to you so deeply
So glad I knew not to rush things with you
'Cause now you've grown on me so naturally
So intriguing you got me feeling
I could stay witchu for hours
So why's your hold so warm then cold
Oh please don't be a coward
Uuuh, does it make you feel good
Knowing that you could
Have power on me
And uuuh uh, does it make you feel good
Knowing that you could
Have power on me
(Have power on me) [x6]
So does it make you feel good
Cause that's the only way I want you to feel with me
Now what's it make you feel like
Do you feel somehow you could open up your heart to me
[x2]
Uuuh, does it make you feel good
Knowing that you could
Have power on me
And uuuh uh, does it make you feel good
Knowing that you could
Have power on me
(Have power on me) [x7]
