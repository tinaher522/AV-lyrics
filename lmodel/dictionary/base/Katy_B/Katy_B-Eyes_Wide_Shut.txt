<song artist="Katy_B" title="Eyes_Wide_Shut">
(Katy B)
They say that some things are too good to be true,
But I just hope they ain't talking about you,
I heard that everything must come to an end,
But I just can't imagine me without you,
Me without you,
(Chorus)
Don't tell me I'm dreaming,
Cause if I've been dreaming,
I don't ever want to wake up,
So in love with this feeling,
Tonight I'll be sleeping
Sleeping with my eyes wide shut,
Cause I don't want to wake up,
Wake up wake up,
I don't want to wake up,
Wake up wake up,
So in love with this feeling,
Tonight I'll be sleeping,
Sleeping with my eyes wide shut,
(Katy B)
Out of sight they say out of mind,
But your image will remain till the end of time,
I'm strong but hearts are easy to break,
Don't want to fall if there ain't no one to catch me,
Me without you,
Me without you,
Oh I don't ever want to wake up,
(Chorus)
Don't tell me I'm dreaming,
Cause if I've been dreaming,
I don't ever want to wake up,
So in love with this feeling,
Tonight I'll be sleeping,
Sleeping with my eyes wide shut,
Cause I don't want to wake up,
Wake up wake up,
I don't want to wake up,
Wake up wake up,
So in love with this feeling,
Tonight I'll be sleeping,
Sleeping with my eyes wide shut,
(Tinie Tempah)
Everybody everywhere throw your hands in the air say yeah say yeah,
Go on put your hands high if you ain't sleeping tonight say yeah, yeah.
Tonight I'll be sleeping,
(Katy B)
Don't tell me I'm dreaming,
Cause if I've been dreaming,
I don't ever want to wake up,
So in love with this feeling,
Tonight I'll be sleeping
Sleeping with my eyes wide shut,
Cause I don't want to wake up,
Wake up wake up,
I don't want to wake up,
Wake up wake up,
So in love with this feeling,
Tonight I'll be sleeping,
Sleeping with my eyes wide shut,
Everybody everywhere throw your hands in the air say yeah say yeah,
Go on put your hands high if you ain't sleeping tonight say yeah, yeah.
Sleeping with my eyes wide shut.
