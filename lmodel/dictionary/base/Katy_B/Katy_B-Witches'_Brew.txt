KATY B - Witches' Brew
(Ahh Ahh Ahh Ahh)
I'll open this book and blow the dust
From these pages of desire and lust
I'll search for a spell perfect for you
'Cause I need to get you enchanted with me... too
Oh oh ooooh
Come see what I got for you
All the others got me misunderstood
Come with me, I'll make you feel so good
Come with me, I'll make you feel so good
Oh oh ooooh
I need you to feel it too
All the others got me misunderstood
Come with me, I'll make you feel so good
Come with me, I'll make you feel so good
Blood Mary type rose petals go into my room
Storm in and slowly, around I go thinking of you
And how sweet life will be when you are finally mine
I'll wake and live life like I've longed for all this time
Oh oh ooooh
Come see what I got for you
All the others got me misunderstood
Come with me, I'll make you feel so good
Come with me, I'll make you feel so good
Oh oh ooooh
I need you to feel it too
All the others got me misunderstood
Come with me, I'll make you feel so good
Come with me, I'll make you feel so good
Open up your eyes now
Now your love belongs to me
Open up your eyes now
Now there's no escaping me
[X2]
Oh oh ooooh
Come see what I got for you
All the others got me misunderstood
Come with me, I'll make you feel so good
Come with me, I'll make you feel so good
Oh oh ooooh
I need you to feel it too
All the others got me misunderstood
Come with me, I'll make you feel so good
Come with me, I'll make you feel so good
