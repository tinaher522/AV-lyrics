(Intro)
Oh, oh, oh, ohhooooh
(Katy B)
You spin this, no spining this
Always you drive like a extreme
Anyway where we stop, got a emotion
Just still, hold my way
Against you got a extreme champion
Dare you only no way
Extremely dare way, step my shine spirit
(Chorus)
I Promise you, i can't go 2 Far
Anyway where we stop you, let me go
Anywhere we stop, in royal ground
Stand up, i talk you, touch me not a freak
I'm not fare, always 2 Far Ibiza
Stand up on my talk
Talk me when i go to shop
It's anywhere see to do
(Katy B)
Anywhere like a champion
Request me, i'm not stranger
(Rest In Peace) Talk me anywhere 20 hours
(Rest In Peace) Just you not living BangÂ !!
(Rest In Peace) Talk not 20 Roots
(Rest In Peace) It's not 2 Far
Stand up, or stand down
(Chorus)
I Promise you, i can't go 2 Far
Anyway where we stop you, let me go
Anywhere we stop, in royal ground
Stand up, i talk you, touch me not a freak
I'm not fare, always 2 Far Ibiza
Stand up on my talk
Talk me when i go to shop
It's anywhere see to do
(Wiley)
Yeah, i can you stand me
I'm Not Gangsta, I'm Wiley
Just talk me about a Thomas Pitt
Angela knows now or never
Wear my clothes, wear my trainers
See with me when i come
Talk me when i go
Always take control
Not talk with delegates
Electricity works humming
Alway till the end
Start with me, quick me
Droping chairs, it's big smoke
(Chorus)
I Promise you, i can't go 2 Far
Anyway where we stop you, let me go
Anywhere we stop, in royal ground
Stand up, i talk you, touch me not a freak
I'm not fare, always 2 Far Ibiza
Stand up on my talk
Talk me when i go to shop
It's anywhere see to do
(2x)
