(Katy B - Verse 1)
You know you love me, i know you care
Just shout whenever, and i'll be there
You are my love, you are my heart
And we will never, ever, ever be apart
Are we an item? Girl, quit playing
We're just friends what are you saying
Said there's another and looked right in my eyes
My first love broke my heart for the first time
(Chorus 1)
And i was like baby, baby, baby, oooooooooh
Like baby, baby, baby, noooooooooo
Like baby, baby, baby, ooooooooooh
I Thought you'd always be mine, mine 
Baby, baby, baby, oooooooooh
Like baby, baby, baby, noooooooooo
Like baby, baby, baby, ooooooooooh
I Thought you'd always be mine, mine 
(Katy B - Verse 2)
For you, i would have done whatever
And i just can't believe we're here together
And i wanna play it cool, but i'm losing you
I'll buy you anything, I'll buy you any ring
And i'm in pieces, baby fix me
And just shake me 'til you wake me from this bad dream 
I'm going down, down, down, down
And i just can't believe my first love won't be around
(Chorus 2)
And i was like baby, baby, baby, oooooooooh
Like baby, baby, baby, noooooooooo
Like baby, baby, baby, ooooooooooh
I Thought you'd always be mine, mine 
Baby, baby, baby, oooooooooh
Like baby, baby, baby, noooooooooo
Like baby, baby, baby, ooooooooooh
I Thought you'd always be mine, mine 
(Ludacris - Verse 3)
Luda! When i was 13, i had my first love
There was nobody that compared to my baby
And nobody came between us, no-one could ever come above
She had me going crazy, oh I was star-struck,
She woke me up daily, don't need no Starbucks.
She made my heart pound, I skip a beat when I see her in the street and
At school on the playground but I really wanna see her on the weekend.
She knows she got me dazing cause she was so amazing
And now my heart is breaking but I just keep on saying....
(Katy B - Chorus)
Baby, baby, baby, oooooooooh
Like baby, baby, baby, noooooooooo
Like baby, baby, baby, ooooooooooh
I Thought you'd always be mine, mine 
Baby, baby, baby, oooooooooh
Like baby, baby, baby, noooooooooo
Like baby, baby, baby, ooooooooooh
I Thought you'd always be mine, mine 
I'm all gone
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Now i'm all gone
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Now i'm all gone
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Now i'm all gone, gone, gone, gone
I'm all gone
