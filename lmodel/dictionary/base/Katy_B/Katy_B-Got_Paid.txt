<song artist="Katy_B" title="Got_Paid">
Open my door and I scream like it's been ages 
How ya doing girl? You look amazing
 Oh my gosh, oh my gosh  
New acrylics, gold studs with the red fade
 Diva lipstick, liquid liner make you wanna say
 Oh my gosh, oh my gosh
Friday never lets me down 
So grab your coat, we're gonna hit the town
 But I just got paid, I just got paid
  Friday never lets me down 
So grab your coat, we're gonna hit the town 
But I just got paid, I just got paid
Hop in the cab, tell the driver "turn the music up"
 Let the window shake, feel the vibration 
Feel so free, feel so free
  Straight to the floor, I let the beat mend my broken heart
 No looking back, to the future I raise a glass
 Down on three, down on three
 One, two, three, go
Friday never lets me down 
So grab your coat, we're gonna hit the town
 But I just got paid, I just got paid  
Friday never lets me down
 So grab your coat, we're gonna hit the town
 But I just got paid, I just got paid
You see I'm ready to let it go 
Show that boy what he'll be missing, let him know 
You see I'm ready to hear it loud 
Show that boy that he'll be missing, missing out  
You see I'm ready to let it go 
Show that boy what he'll be missing, let him know
 You see I'm ready to hear it loud 
Show that boy that he'll be missing, missing out
Just got paid, stroll through the city
 I wanna spend some, put the rest in the kitty
 I'm rolling with K B, so jiggy 
My name's William, I said I'm gonna make a milly
  Hard work is paying off, 'k, now they pay us
 It's like paying off day, radio play us
 Feel good 'cause I know I work hard for this
 Been grafting a lot from the start of this
  And then splash like alakzam and then raise it
 We shop 'til we drop, let's face it 
Friday is here and it's a great thing
 Got an appetite for fun love to taste
  The time, I don't waste it, I like my life basic 
And whatever the case is
 If I see a chance to win I'm gonna take it
 And it's working right, we're gonna make it
Friday never lets me down 
So grab your coat, we're gonna hit the town
 But I just got paid, I just got paid  
Friday never lets me down 
So grab your coat, we're gonna hit the town 
But I just got paid, I just got paid  
Friday never lets me down
 So grab your coat, we're gonna hit the town
 But I just got paid, I just got paid  
Friday never lets me down 
So grab your coat, we're gonna hit the town
 But I just got paid, I just got paid
