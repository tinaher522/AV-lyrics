<song artist="Katy_B" title="Light_As_A_Feather">
What does it take to make you feel, get you excited
 To see you smile?
 What does it take to see my world, I know you'll like it 
For once go wild
  Baby, but you're so cold with me, be free, yeah
 Come see the sights
 Lover, there's a city you've never seen before 
Come live by night
What's it gonna take for me to see you get down yeah 
Get, get down yeah 
Get down yeah
 (Let's go)
  Get down yeah
 Get down yeah
 Get down yeah
What does it take to feel that beat, let it inside you
 Touch your soul
 What does it take to just let the rhythm guide you
 And take control  
Baby, don't be scared, don't be self concious
 Close your eyes
 Lover, are you feeling light as a feather?
 Ready to fly
What's it gonna take for me to see you get down yeah
 Get, get down yeah 
Get down yeah
  Get down yeah 
Get down yeah
 Get down yeah 
What's it gonna take for me to see you get down yeah
Top of the penthouse, come party with us 
Lose control, I heat up when we touch
 Take for tonight belongs to us
 I'll be your drug, come get high, feel my rush  
Baby, baby, let's get crazy
 Maybe I'll introduce you to amazing
 Show me your wild side, I'll be your Vegas
 Don't hold back, it's yours for the taking
What does it take to make you feel, get you excited
 To see you smile? 
What does it take to see my world, I know you'll like it 
For once go wild
  Baby, but you're so cold with me, be free, yeah
 Come see the sights
 Lover, there's a city you've never seen before 
Come live by night
What's it gonna take for me to see you get down yeah
 Get, get down yeah
 Get down yeah 
(Let's go)
  Get down yeah 
Get down yeah
Get down yeah  
Get down yeah 
Get down yeah
 Get down yeah 
Get down yeah
  Get down yeah
