(Eric Turner)
It's the way of the stages like a stereo sun
Oh, us, ey, it's like a stereo sun
It's the way of the love, sister at's go
Stage, us, ey, it's like a stereo sun
(Katy B)
The moonlight heats as you come at go
Anywhere moves up
Anywhere when you just still, just when you go
This spotlights double go
Anywhere, trust me
Musics have a of my tonight
Anywhere stop of me, i know where you go
Just friends saying, what are you say
My heart pound starts, but i'm said...
(Eric Turner)
It's the way of the stages like a stereo sun
Oh, us, ey, it's like a stereo sun
It's the way of the love, sister at's go
Stage, us, ey, it's like a stereo sun
(Katy B)
Anywhere, trust me
Middle the floor
Anywhere when you still
Just here you go
Anywhere you trust me
Always have a one performance, it's a dance hotter
Never or of me, just we go and i go
Always i buy you ring
Play cool and dance with me
(Eric Turner)
It's the way of the stages like a stereo sun
Oh, us, ey, it's like a stereo sun
It's the way of the love, sister at's go
Stage, us, ey, it's like a stereo sun
(Katy B)
The moonlight heats
As you coming back
Anywhere, still we go
Almost dance with me
Anywhere go, beacuse there you are
(Eric Turner)
It's like a stereo sun, it's like a stereo sun
It's the way of the love, sister at's go
Stage, us, ey, it's like a stereo sun
It's the way of the stages like a stereo sun
Oh, us, ey, it's like a stereo sun
It's the way of the love, sister at's go
Stage, us, ey, it's like a stereo sun
It's like a stereo sun, it's like a stereo sun
It's like a stereo sun, it's like a stereo sun
