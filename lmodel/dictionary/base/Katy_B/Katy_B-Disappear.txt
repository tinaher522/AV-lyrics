<song artist="Katy_B" title="Disappear">
So sad that we have lost all our innocence
Something that was pure is now covered in red
Tainted by the role to become a woman
I thought that it'll cure
So why am I still walking towards you?
Right, left, my feet are full prepared
But how can I change direction
When you smile at me, I'm infected
Now should we lie to keep each other here
Or tell the truth and burn
Are you the man I thought you were
Or is there more to learn
And this would be unfair to tell you that
The whole of me is here
'Cause I woke up one day to find that I have disappeared
Oh-oh-oh, I have disappeared
Oh-oh-oh, I have disappeared
Oh-oh-oh, I have disappeared
Oh-oh-oh
The way that we would lie
I look into your eye
I wouldn't get a dime
Now I don't see the fire
Tainted by the role to become the man
You let me where you can
Like you didn't give a damn
It's mad
How something so real
Could be so conditional
But how can I change direction
When you smile at me, I'm infected
Now should we lie to keep each other here
Or tell the truth and burn
Am I the girl you thought I was
Or is there more to learn?
And this would be unfair to tell you that
The whole of me is here
I woke up one day to find that I have disappeared
Oh-oh-oh, I have disappeared
Oh-oh-oh, I have disappeared
Oh-oh-oh, I have disappeared
Oh-oh-oh
Now today we have then spoke and I'm still fine
But I'm scared about tomorrow
Where I must store in my sorrow
If it's not here to taste the pride
To live, to feel
Is it real?
Is it real?
Oh-oh-oh, I woke up one day to find that I was gone
Oh-oh-oh, where is the fun?
Oh-oh-oh, where did our hearts go?
Oh-oh-oh, I can't find you, no
