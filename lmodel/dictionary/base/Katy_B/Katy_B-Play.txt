[Verse 1: Katy B]
Play me, pull my strings
Bring out a melody in me
Hear my heart it sings
All these words I need to say to you
Softly, call my name
The pitch shifts and I’m at your mercy
So say it say it, say it again
I’m hungry for this sound, for your loving I'm thirsty
[Verse 2: Sampha]
Am I a dreamer, am I insane
And all these colors keep dripping through my brain
It’s more than they’re worth, it’s more than words
The melody played with places on my heart
[Chorus: Sampha &amp; Katy B]
Hey, hey
Play me those melodies
Hey, hey
Play me those melodies
Hey, hey
Play me those melodies
Hey, hey
Play me those melodies
[Verse 3: Katy B]
Hit me, play my keys
Show me what is this I’m feeling
A hundred harmonies, come together am I still dreaming?
Your lullaby lives in my brain
Wake me before I gotta leave and
So say it say it, say it again
So I know it’s you, yea so I can believe it
[Verse 4: Sampha &amp; Katy B]
[Sampha]
Play me, those memories
And I’ll play you, these melodies
In my mind, Like a nova, a shooting star
We were meant to collide
[Katy B]
Play me, those memories
And I’ll play you, these melodies
In my mind, Like a nova, a shooting star
We were meant to collide
[Both]
We were meant to collide
We were meant to collide
We were meant to collide
We were meant to collide
