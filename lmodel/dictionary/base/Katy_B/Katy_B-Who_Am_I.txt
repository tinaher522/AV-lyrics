<song artist="Katy_B" title="Who_Am_I">
I got this pain and I don't know what to do with it
I got this pain, but I just can't go through with it
I can't let go, so you just take the best of me
I can't let go, cause I don't know who else to be
Who am I if I ain't loving you?
Tell me
Who am I if I ain't loving you?
Baby
Who am I if you're not loving me?
Tell me
Cause you and me, that's my identity
I feel so cold
Cause I know that you be lovin' somebody new, babe
Well that's the word around town
I feel so cold
And I don't even know what I'm supposed to do now
Thought you were holding me down
You don't care
Cause I see the look in your eyes, baby
Actions speakin' louder than words lately
You don't care
Something's telling me that I should still be fighting for you
Who am I if I ain't loving you?
Tell me
Who am I if I ain't loving you?
Baby
Who am I if you're not loving me?
Tell me
Cause you and me, that's my identity
Take me back
To the day your heart belongs to me
Take me back
Only your touch, boy, can set me free
There's no test
He can't love you like I do
There's no test
Cause all of me, I gave to you, you
Who am I if I ain't loving you?
Tell me
Who am I if I ain't loving you?
Baby
Who am I if you're not loving me?
Tell me
Cause you and me, that's my identity
I don't know who I am if I ain't in your arms, baby
I don't know, I don't know
I don't know who I am if I ain't in your arms, baby
I don't know, I don't know
Who am I if I ain't loving you?
Tell me
Who am I if I ain't loving you?
Baby
Who am I if you're not loving me
Tell me
Cause you and me, that's my identity
