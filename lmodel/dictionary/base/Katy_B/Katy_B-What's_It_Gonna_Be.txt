Ohhooooh
Every time I see your face I jus gotta talk to you
There's something every time ohh baby its so true
I just wanna talk to you and tell you how I feel,
Every time I see your face
Baby this love is real,
I can not let it go
You no I'm all for you,
So what we gonna do? What we gonna do?
(Chorus)
Every time I see your face I no its true
Baby there's something I gotta say I'm just in love with you
And I no that you're the one for me
So what's it gonna, what's it gonna be?
(Katy B)
And I need to know how you feel about me
So give me a call whenever you feeling lonely,
And ill come by and I let you get to no me
(Platnum)
I just wanna talk to you and tell you how I feel
Every time I see your face, I no this love is real.
I need you girl you are the only one for me
So what's it gonna be? So what's it gonna be?
Every time I sit alone I think of you
Your eyes your thighs your lips,
Got me thinking stuff I wanna do
And I no that, you're the girl for me
So what's it gonna, what's it gonna be?
What's it gonna be yea?
What's it gonna be?

(Platnum)
When I met you boy, everything was cool it was like a dream
I was so in love, you were so in love it was meant to be
Laying side by side till the morning light, boy you and me
So take me hand, this is my plan its destiny
That's why I'd love to, get to no you better
Something about you
I cant explain, its just the way you are
I love the things you do
So what we, what we gonna do?
(Chorus)
Every time I see you I notice your smile
I see your face, I no that's its real
I can not let it go you no I'm all for you
So what we gonna? What we gonna do?
I just wanna talk to you and tell you how I feel,
Every time I see your face
Baby this love is real,
I can not let it go
You no im all for you,
So what we gonna do? What we gonna do?
