<song artist="Katy_B" title="Movement">
Don't you let me down again
Stuck in this small car, and even then
My electric gets me further
When did our love turn to burden?
When my eyes are red and sore
I can't see you any more
Cause my senses turning hazy
As our temper's going crazy
Silence is the sound of now
When I much prefer love
Bold and loud
Give me movement, give me movement
I need some kind of improvement
Give me movement, give me movement
Let me know that you can do it
Give me movement, give me movement
I need some kind of improvement
When there's no one I'd rather love
You keep darkness 'bove the love
How we're meant to move if, there's no movement [x5]
Back to the starting point again
I'm getting cozy here, my friend
'Cause the dice aint got no numbers
Stay here still have time to wonder
Was I always like this
Or did I have some kind of fun
Letting go of all my stresses
But now you got me feeling restless
Silence is the sound of now
When I much prefer love
Bold and loud
Give me movement, give me movement
I need some kind of improvement
Give me movement, give me movement
Let me know that you can do it
Give me movement, give me movement
I need some kind of improvement
When there's no one I'd rather love
You keep darkness 'bove the love
How we're meant to move if, there's no movement
