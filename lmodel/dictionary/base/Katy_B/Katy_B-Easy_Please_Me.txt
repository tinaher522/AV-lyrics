<song artist="Katy_B" title="Easy_Please_Me">
Standing at the bar with my friend Olivia,
We were trying our best to catch up.
That's when he walked over,
said I'd like to get to know you,
but all I could say is look I'm sorry love.
You see I've had difficulties too many time before,
and right now it's not really my thing.
He said just give me two minutes of your time and tell me what you like me to be offering.
It's not that easy,
It's not that easy,
These days can't find a man to please me.
Their lines are far to cheesy,
No boy is on a level believe me,
No boy is on a level believe me,
These days can't find a man to please me,
No boy is on a level believe me,
These days can't find a man to please me.
You don't have to have a lot of money,
All you've got to have is fire burning deep in your soul.
If you have a dream for something that you love,
I'll support you yeah I'll play my role.
Now I won't call you 20 times a day,
Because I've got my own shit to do.
When you see my name flashing on your phone,
I want you to feel butterflies for me too.
It's not that easy,
Its not that easy,
These days can't find a man to please me.
Their lines are far to cheesy,
No boy is on a level believe me,
No boy is on a level believe me.
These days can't find a man to please me,
No boy is on a level believe me,
These days can't find a man to please me
Now one thing I can't stand is arrogance,
There is no way we would ever get along,
But one thing I love is confidence,
And humility to know when you've been wrong.
Now I love a bad boy mantality,
But I don't want to be visiting no jail.
Just know someone out there mocking me,
Be my gangster when its time to get real.
It's not that easy,
Its not that easy,
These days can't find a man to please me.
Their lines are far to cheesy,
No boy is on a level believe me,
No boy is on a level believe me.
These days can't find a man to please me,
No boy is on a level believe me,
These days can't find a man to please me.
