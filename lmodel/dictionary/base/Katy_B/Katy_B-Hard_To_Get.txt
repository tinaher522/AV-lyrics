<song artist="Katy_B" title="Hard_To_Get">
Why you playin' hard to get?
Or do you know me inside?
I have no challenge
I haven't one yet see
Keep playin' in vain
But I'll figure you out
It won't be long till
I've got you in my grasp
Here is what this must be
I won't hurt you, no no
Just trust me
And I'll be here for you
Why don't you open up
Come a bit closer (to me)
I wanna show you
Exactly what we could be
Why don't you open up
Come a bit closer (to me)
I wanna show you
Exactly what we could be
Why don't you open up to me, baby?
I want to show you exactly what we could be
Why don't you open up to me, baby?
See I want to show you exactly what we could be
Don't know what it is about you that makes me focused
I need to get my way, so don't obstruct it
Now why you're being difficult?
Don't think I can't reach you
I see the way you think
And I like it
Here is what this must be
I won't hurt you, no no
Just trust me
And I'll be here for you
Why don't you open up
Come a bit closer (to me)
I wanna show you
Exactly what we could be
Why don't you open up
Come a bit closer (to me)
I wanna show you
Exactly what we could be
Why don't you open up to me?
Why don't you open up
Come a bit closer (to me)
I wanna show you
Exactly what we could be
Why don't you open up
Come a bit closer (to me)
I wanna show you
Exactly what we could...
Oh darling, why won't you come closer, come closer
I wanna show you
I wanna show you
Why don't you open up to, open up to me
I want to show you
I want to show you
Please, oh baby please
Oh baby, why you playin' hard to get with me
I will keep on waiting till you don't
I want to show you
