(Katy B)
Turn the lights on
Turn the lights on
I close my eyes and I sleep at night
All I see is the clear bright lights
And I'm fallin in love with the game
I'm in dreamland so it all goes right
And I saw it all myself
So fresh up air I could smell myself
All I hear is the beautiful music
In my ears ringing off like bells (bells)
Sweet dreams come true
High life on the yo on the late night cruise
We're partying hard like dem rock stars do
Next day repeat deja vu
And all these flakes to my tunes
I still remain focused faced to a few
So I stay here in the top through
And I'm giving 'em catch 22
(Amelle)
You can be a sweet dreams, or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I don't wanna wake up from you (turn the lights on)
Sweet dreams or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me, your love's too good to be true (turn the lights on)
(Katy B)
My guilty pleasure I aint goin nowhere (nah)
As long as you're here
Me I'll be floating on air (turn the lights on)
(Amelle)
You can be a sweet dreams, or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I don't wanna wake up from you (turn the lights on)
(Katy B)
Yo, knock, knock, can you hear me
Its only me, Little Kate, don't fear me
I see the backs all turning clearly
And at that much closer I'm nearly
I'm nearly there till I reach that stage
All inside I'm releasing rage
Now I'm inside I'm face to face
With the ones that, doubted how's it taste
What's it like lemme feel ya (ya)
Speak up I can't hear ya (ya)
Stand in the light lemme see ya
And don't try getting bright either
Cos its not the time to play hero
I'm freezing minus zero
I'm taking off my halo
So who's to blame I'm turning cold
(Amelle)
You can be a sweet dreams, or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I don't wanna wake up from this (turn the lights on)
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me, your love's too good to be true (turn the lights on)
(Katy B)
My guilty pleasure I aint goin nowhere (nah)
As long as you're here
Me I'll be floating on air (turn the lights on)
(Amelle)
You can be a sweet dreams, or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I don't wanna wake up from you (turn the lights on)
You can be a sweet dreams, or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I don't wanna wake up from you (turn the lights on)
Sweet dreams or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me, your love's too good to be true (turn the lights on)
(Katy B)
My guilty pleasure I aint goin nowhere (nah)
As long as you're here
Me I'll be floating on air (turn the lights on)
(Amelle)
You can be a sweet dreams, or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I don't wanna wake up from you (turn the lights on)
Beat Again, Beat Again
Beat Again, Beat Again
Beat Again, Beat Again
Beat Again, Beat Again
