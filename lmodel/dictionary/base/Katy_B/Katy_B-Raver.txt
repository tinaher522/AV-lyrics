(Katy B)
I know you the raver
I know you the raver to me
Beacuse you can't stand to me
I know you the raver
Beacuse you scare with a raver
(Ms. Dynamite)
Just we talk about you
Stand me observe me
Trust me anywhere
It's not rest in peace, it's raver
You something dance hotter now
If you not dancing colder now
You something drink in the glass
Your radiator it's hotter heat
