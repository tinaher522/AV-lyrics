<song artist="Katy_B" title="I_Like_You">
Too many nights I stayed awake until the dawn
Since I've always got my mind and my heart torn
I touch a rose woke up myself up on the floor
But there's something I can feel when I'm with you
I recognize it, it's something so brand new
I can't help it, hope that you're feeling it too
[Chorus: x2]
I like you a little bit (yeah)
I like you a little bit
(More than I should)
I like you a little bit (yeah)
I like you a little bit
(More than I should)
[Verse 2:]
You think I learned from all those times my heart was crushed
I'm a victim of that appetite, that lust
'Cause I want that feeling, loving is that much
Now I know why I really shouldn't play with fire
But with true love I should be so tired
But the way you move just fills me with desire
[Chorus: x2]
I like you a little bit (yeah)
I like you a little bit
(More than I should)
I like you a little bit (yeah)
I like you a little bit
(More than I should)
[Bridge: x2]
I can't help it
Now you got a hold on me
I can't help it
You're taking control of me
[Chorus: x2]
I like you a little bit (yeah)
I like you a little bit
(More than I should)
I like you a little bit (yeah)
I like you a little bit
(More than I should)
