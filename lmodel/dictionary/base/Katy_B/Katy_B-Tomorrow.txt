(Bluey Robinson)
Ooooohh ooooohhh, ohhooohhh,
(Katy B)
Yeah, This is my side of the story, here me out.
It's like my pen has emotions, I wanna pull my anger to motion.
Tears start coming out, [?] this paper when I cry me a river [?].
There's a whole lifetime ahead of us,
Patience, keyword, trust, we ain't got a rush.
Happy I'm [?], but for I'm in [?]
Don't lose your lost, try me it's forever love.
Know what it feels like, when your friends so light
Thought you were [?], you're in the same blood type.
Told it, tomorrow ain't far, hold tight.
Then it told me feels like a lifetime.
(Bluey Robinson)
Please don't let go, don't let go, you're in sometimes.
It's moments away, it's that close, it's that close.
Just hold on till tomorrow, price is high, I don't got time to borrow.
But it feels like I'll make it through the sorrow.
But I won't about tomorrowwww, tomorrow.
(Katy B)
Don't be afraid, wipe the sleep from your eyes, gotta stay awake.
It's... only a day away, at the same time it's like a year [?] away.
It's another maze, would they have it anyway, it's another case.
Face it, another page, price you gotta pay, pay. done the first few, now it's another stage.
This is my side of the story, this is my blood, sweat, tears and glory.
[?] them blood and it really gets [?] no lie [?].
Deal with the pressure, comes with the pain, so cruel, friends won't look at me the same.
It's a clown with a smile like it doesn't mean a thing, but my heart burns with pain.
Tomorrow is the day, so I'm counting... down the hours until the plain's landing.
I'll follow that lane, don't step out in the [?], hundred percent no doubtin'
(Bluey Robinson)
Please don't let go, don't let go, you're in [?] now.
It's moments away, it's that close, it's that close.
Just hold on till tomorrow, price is high, I don't got time to borrow.
But it feels like I'll make it through the sorrow.
But I won't about tomorrowwww, tomorrow.
