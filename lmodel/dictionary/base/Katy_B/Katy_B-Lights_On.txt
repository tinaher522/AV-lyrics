<song artist="Katy_B" title="Lights_On">
I keep on moving with the lights on,
Chorus
I keep on moving with the lights on
(with the lights on)
So come and play me just one more song
I keep on moving with the lights on
(with the lights on)
So you can't scare me with the lights on
Step in'a the club and them come a turn and them a watch me
Step on  to the floor man then a come a watch me and a clock me
Bass come like a trigger and the DJ come and shot me
Riddim take control and nothing can stop me vibes them got me
Because take a glass of water now
Dance is getting hotter now
Drowning in the heat and I don't wanna leave
Rude girl you know we look hot
From we tick the time, we drip drop
Caught up in the night and we ain't ready to go home
Said I will keep on going until they say so
And even when they do it's so hard for me to go
Some others are in the clock room
Some others are at the door
We can keep on going in the middle of the floor
Chorus X2 
Now you can watch me if you like it
Cause I really don't care
I'll be the same if there was only me
Inside of here
Cause this is where I'm meant to be
I ain't going nowhere
You're gonna have to move me if you want me outaa here
Said I will keep on going until they say so
And even when they do it's so hard for me to go
While some others at the cloak room
Some others out the door
We can keep on going in the middle of the floor
Chorus X2
Just one more please play come gimme
Mr Sound Boy me not done, you no see me
Free in the heat and the beat till i sleep
Lord a'mercy how the vibes so sweet 
Bad girl stamina cant done, lights on.
Still dip and go down
Tick it and a tock and a dip it and a drop it
And a rock it my selector don't stop it
Chorus
Play me one more song
With the lights on
Lights on
I keep on moving with the lights on
Come and play me one more song
Yeah
With the lights on
