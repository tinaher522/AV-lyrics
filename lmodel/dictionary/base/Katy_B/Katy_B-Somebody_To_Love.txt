[Katy B]
Ohh Ohh aaaaaaaaaaaah
For you I'd write a symphony
I'd tell the violin
It's time to sink or swim
Watch him play for ya
For you I'd be (Whoa)
Runnin a thousand miles
Just get you where you are
Step to the beat of my heart.
I don't need a whole lot
But for you I need I
Rather give you the world
Or we can share mine
I know that I won't be the first one
Given you all this attention
But baby listen
I just need somebody to love
I-I don't need too much
Just need somebody to love.
(Somebody to love)
I don't need nothing else
I promise girl, I swear.
I just need somebody to love.
I need somebody I-I need somebody
I need somebody I-I need somebody.
[Usher]
Everyday I bring the sun around
I sweep away the clouds.
Smile for me (Smile for me)
I would take
Every second, every single time
Spend it like my last dime.
Step to the beat of my heart.
I don't need a whole lot
But for you I need I
Rather give you the world
Or we can share mine
I know I won't be the first one
Given you all this attention
But baby listen
[Katy B &amp; Usher]
I just need somebody to love (Ohh, no no no no)
I-I don't need too much
Just need somebody to love.
(Somebody to love)
I don't need nothing else
I promise girl, I swear.
I just need somebody to love.
I need somebody I-I need somebody
I need somebody I-I need somebody.
(Somebody to love)
I need somebody I-I need somebody
I need somebody I-I need somebody.
[Katy B]
And you can have it all
Anything you want I can bring
Give you the finer things, yeah
[Usher]
But what I really want
I can't find 'cause, money can't find me.
Somebody to love. (Ohh Whoa)
[Katy B &amp; Usher]
Find me somebody to love (Ohh)
I need somebody to love (Yeah)
I-I don't need too much
Just somebody to love.
Somebody to love.I don't need nothing else,
I promise girl I swear,I just need somebody to love.
I need somebody, I-I need somebody
I need somebody, I-I need somebody
(Somebody to love)

I need somebody (I swear I just need somebody to love)
I-I need somebody.
Oh oh oh oh oh... etc
Is she out there
