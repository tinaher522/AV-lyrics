<song artist="Katy_B" title="Still">
We chose this simple life
My love was way too much for you to bear
It left our world to end right there 
But I still hear you whispering my name
Surely there's a part avenged
How could you be so far away?
When I still see your face like it was only yesterday 
And although you're out of sight
Would you still be the same if I was left for you tonight? 
Still
Still on my mind now, still
You still know how to make me feel
How come these wounds won't heal?
You're still on my mind now, still 
Now how could I compete
With something bigger than the both of us?
I will be not good enough 
We gave it all and watched it burn away
But the ashes still remain
I wonder what it is you say
When you close your eyes, what do you ask for when you pray? 
What do you need to soothe your soul?
Why can't I find something else to make sense of it all? 
Still
Still on my mind now, still
You still know how to make me feel
How come these wounds won't heal?
You're still on my mind now? 
I can't let go, don't wanna let go
I can't let go, don't wanna let go 
Still
Still on my mind now, still
You still know how to make me feel
How come these wounds won't heal?
You still have the power
Still, when we walked
I thought we'd fade to gray
Thinking if you feel the same
If I don't want to heal
Why won't this heart beat still? 
You're still on my mind now, still
You're still on my mind now, still
