(Intro)
Katy B, Yeah aah Kelly Rowland lets go
(Kelly Rowland)
Invincible, invincible
Invincible, invincible
We're invincible
(Katy B)
Yeah aah they said we shouldn't, ahh they said we wouldn't
Aah look where we are, We've done what they thought we couldn't
As bad as the odds were looking, Push yeah we kept on pushing
And every time I nearly hit the ground, You were my cushion
There's evidence that proves, That you were heaven sent
'Cos when I needed resucin', You were there at my defence
Girl in you I find a friend, You make me feel alive again
And I feel like the brightest star, 'Cos you make me shine again
(Kelly Rowland)
No matter where we are, No matter just how far are paths may lead
We don't need no shields, Love is the armour that we need
We're invincible, Invincible
Invincible, Loves our protector
Invincible, Invincible
Invincible, We're invincible
(Katy B)
Aah from the wildest water, aah to the highest mountains
Aah you and i forever, Even through the driest deserts
You lift me higher than ever, I feel as light as a feather
And when we're fightin' together, We can take on the weather
I will keep you warm through, Every single storm you
Ever have to walk through, I will go before you
I will be the voice when you, Need someone to talk to
Please don't ever doubt me, Let me reassure you
(Kelly Rowland)
No matter where we are (wooo), No matter just how far are paths may lead
We don't need no shields, Love is the armour that we need
We're invincible (we are), Invincible (you are)
Invincible, Loves our protector
Invincible (we are), Invincible (you are)
Invincible, We're invincible
(Katy B)
It's you and I against the world
They can't stop us now
We've come too far
We've worked too hard
We're invincible
Forever
(Kelly Rowland)
No matter where we are, No matter just how far are paths may lead
We're invincible
No matter where we are (no matter where we are)
No matter just how far are paths may lead
We don't need no shields, Love is the armour that we need
We're invincible (we are), Invincible (we are)
Invincible, Loves our protector
Invincible (we are), Invincible (we are)
Invincible, We're invincible
