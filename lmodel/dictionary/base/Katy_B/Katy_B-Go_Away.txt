<song artist="Katy_B" title="Go_Away">
I open my eyes
What, you lying there, the sun breathing on your skin
It became an unwritten rule with you
Somehow i always seem to give in
Boy you got the beat so strong
Your stubornness is proven oh but id - for you
And i know where youd walk for me
But we gotta speak it
Oh so quietly
If you could please just 
Go away
Leave me alone 
Yeah fly away
Into the stars 
Never see your face 
It would make my world such a better place
If you could please just 
X2
You open your eyes
Watch me lying there
What good to know what you see
Once i get to know what you feel
And what you think
If only i could step in your skin
But you see i already know
Itll end in tears when you carry out all my fears
Being here's a dangerous game
Ill end up insane
And only have myself to blame
If you could please just
Go away
Leave me alone 
Yeah fly away
Into the stars 
Never see your face 
It would make my world such a better place
If you could please just 
X2
I know that you care
But its never enough
I know youll be there
But its never enough
Please just play fair
I dont ask you for love
Cos i dont need no empty words here
I know that you care
But its never enough
I know youll be there
But its never enough oh
Please just be fair
I dont ask you for love
Cos i dont want your empty words here... 
Ohhhh
If you could please just
Go away
Leave me alone 
Yeah fly away
Into the stars 
Never see your face (never see your face.. ohhhhh)
It would make my world such a better place
If you could please just 
X2
