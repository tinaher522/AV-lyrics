<song artist="Katy_B" title="I_Wanna_Be">
I got a funny feeling in my heart, I really wanna tell you
I didn’t seem to see it at the start but now I wanna tell you
I wanna tell you but I’m just too worried
I think I got just enough Dutch courage tonight
It’s like a hurricane
Tell me baby, maybe you might
I wanna be where you’re taking me higher
I wanna be in your arms
I wanna be where my dreams transpire
Don’t leave me here in the dark
Tell me baby, maybe you might
I wanna be where you’re taking me higher
I wanna be in your arms
I wanna be where my dreams transpire
Don’t leave me here in the dark
I wanna be, I wanna be
I wanna be, I wanna be
I wanna be, I wanna be
I wanna be, I wanna be
I wanna be, I wanna be
I wanna be, I wanna be
I wanna be, I wanna be
I wanna be, I wanna be
I wanna touch you break that barrier get us out the friend zone
It’s getting deeper, now I fantasize when I’m all on my own
I wanna tell you that anxiety’s a bitch babe
Wanna forget about exciting me, I’m losing tonight
Tell me where do I turn, show me now which way
Stuck at a crossroad, tell me baby, maybe you might
I wanna be where you’re taking me higher
I wanna be in your arms
I wanna be where my dreams transpire
Don’t leave me here in the dark
Tell me baby, maybe you might
I wanna be where you’re taking me higher
I wanna be in your arms
I wanna be where my dreams transpire
Don’t leave me here in the dark
I wanna be, I wanna be
I wanna be, I wanna be
I wanna be, I wanna be
I wanna be, I wanna be
I wanna be, I wanna be
I wanna be, I wanna be
I wanna be, I wanna be
I wanna be, I wanna be
You don’t know how good it is to dream of you
I take my time
Tell me do you feel it like I need you to?
Come show me a sign
I wanna be where you’re taking me higher
I wanna be in your arms
I wanna be where my dreams transpire
Don’t leave me here in the dark
Tell me baby, maybe you might
I wanna be where you’re taking me higher
I wanna be in your arms
I wanna be where my dreams transpire
Don’t leave me here in the dark
I wanna be, I wanna be
I wanna be, I wanna be
I wanna be, I wanna be
I wanna be, I wanna be
