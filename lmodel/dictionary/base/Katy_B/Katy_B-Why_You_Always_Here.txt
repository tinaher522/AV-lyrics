<song artist="Katy_B" title="Why_You_Always_Here">
Finally I found my sense
Free from what came next
And then there you appear
You tugged upon my sleeve
Then you said follow me
But I sensed it weren't clear
Can't untangle the signs
You project in to my mind 
Throwing away the memories as I do
I've seen your game before
So try on her, I'm bored of you
Why you always here 
Complaining in my ear
Saying I could give you so much more?
Why do you persist 
To possess my kiss
When she's the one your 
Heart beats for?
Circles build I can't keep up
With your indecisive touch
I'ts too late to make up your mind
I left a while ago
Since then I'm much less cold
You chose her to keep you warm at night
Never asked for your attention
So why'd you think I owe you something?
I've seen your games before
So give them all to her, I'm bored of you
Why you always here 
Complaining in my ear
Saying I could give you so much more?
Why do you persist 
To possess my kiss
When she's the one your 
Heart beats for?
Is it because my love is
Better than hers
My kiss is sweeter than hers
My touch is softer than hers oh?
I bet you thought you could
Have best of both worlds
But you can give it all to her 
Why you always here 
Complaining in my ear
Saying I could give you so much more?
Why do you persist 
To possess my kiss
When she's the one your 
Heart beats for?
