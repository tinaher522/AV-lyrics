<song artist="Katy_B" title="Tell_Me">
I feel you moving close closer to me now
Now that I am free now I'm not in need
Where we were before where we were before
I was not content your messing with my head
So why should I let you back in?
Tellin' me that its all cool
But I wont be a fool for you
No more no more
Tellin' me that we're alright askin'
Why I said goodbye that was kind of obvious
Its kind of obvious
[Chorus: x2]
Tell me what it is tell me what it is
That's got me down like this what is it you do?
I'm losing all control
I'm weak when I am not by you
I feel yourself work again
But I don't wanna be let back in why you makin' this so heard
I feel like I'm out in his head
And it hurts so bad that your well aware but I am so helpless
I'm helpless for your love
[Chorus: x2]
I love you, I need you, I want you, I miss you
I cant live without you oh baby I feel you
U mean the world to me but what do I mean to you 'cause
When I'm all alone all I want is you
'cause you know your my lady lady but you drive me crazy crazy
I wanna kiss you I wanna held you but will you b my baby baby
I'm yours and your mine so baby go ease your mind
Just take the time to un-wind
'cause true love is so hard to find
[Chorus: x2]
