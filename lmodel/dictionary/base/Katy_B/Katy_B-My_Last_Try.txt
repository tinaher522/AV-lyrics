[Eric Turner]
Oh Oh, Oh Oh, Ohhh
Oh Oh, Oh Oh, Ohhh
[Katy B]
Tryin' to (Oh, Oh, Ohhh) treat every time like the last
First like my last, I'm ready for the blast
[Eric Turner]
It's my last trip tonight, I promis you it's quiting time
Aww, Aww, Awwww
It's a hard place to fine, but I can see it in my mind
Yea, Yea, Yea, Nowww
[Katy B]
Yea (Oh Oh, Oh Oh, Ohhh)
Is she (Oh Oh, Oh Oh, Ohhh)
Let me go, let me loose (Oh Oh, Oh Oh, Ohhh)
Katy B
It's like as soon as I step on the stage, it's like a oncore
Yea I'm that sure, that is why they clap more
How long will the world come, Bonjore'
I own this place, where's the keys to my front door, door
This is top flight business, this is first class now I'm caught up in your business
Life is so mean man, white man count my hand
I'm feel like a champian, winning This
Call it a deam come true, (Oh Oh, Oh Oh, Ohhh) cuz I'm living it
All in line,(Oh Oh, Oh Oh, Ohhh) like the time with a rymanist
Perallel, Yea (Oh Oh, Oh Oh, Ohhh) I know it very well
They can't walk in my shoes, let a lone tie a bow with it
Blah
[Eric Turner]
It's my last trip tonight, I promis you it's quiting time
[Katy B]
And this couldn't be the last night, I got to leave with a Bang ??
[Eric Turner]
It's a hard place to find, (trying to find it) but I can see it in my mind
[Katy B]
And I'm ready for the whole ride, get straped in your seats
Hold tight
[Katy B]
See the feeling is so real, sitting back and taking pictures
I'm givin' them a show, I do it for the fans they my people
Step steady careful, Fallowing the key rules, fools Me and them no equal, Why, cuz I'm pouring my hart out to the black Don
And treating each show like the last one, I don't plane sequles
This is it, Michale... Rest in Peace
Tell me what I look like, dark shades on even in the evning (Black)
Three chains on my neck for a reason, LP free time
Call this the Lights On, On
(Oh Oh, Oh Oh, Ohhh) And I tell you what my view is like
(Oh Oh, Oh Oh, Ohhh) thru my lens thru my 20/20 eye sight
(Oh Oh, Oh Oh, Ohhh)I see thousands sing a long to my lines
Cuz I am really on this stage no closer, righttt
[Eric Turner]
It's quiting time, It's quiting time
[Katy B]
And this could not be the last night, I got to leave with a bang ??
[Eric Turner]
It's a hard place to find, but I can see it in my mind
[Katy B]
And I am ready for the whole ride, get straped in your seats
Hold Tight
[Eric Turner]
Oh Oh, Oh Oh, Ohhh
Oh Oh, Oh Oh, Ohhh
Oh Oh, Oh Oh, Ohhh (Check Me)

It's my last trip tonight, I promse you it's quiting time
[Katy B]
And this could be the last night, I got to leave with a bang ??
[Eric Turner]
It is a hard place to find, but I can see it in my mind
[Katy B]
And I'm ready for the whole ride, get straped in your seats
Hold Tight
[Eric Turner]
Oh Oh, Oh Oh, Ohhh
