<song artist="Alessia_Cara" title="Stone">
So much on my mind
I think I think too much
Read between these lines
Unspoken weight of words
But time comes to rest when you are by my side
It blurs
And I will follow where this takes me
And my tomorrows long to be unknown
When all is shaken be my safety
In a world uncertain say you'll be my stone
Change in every wind
The sands of time don't know our name
Oh nothing's sure but surely as we stand
I promise I will stay the same
And I've never seen forever
But I know we'll remain
And I will follow where this takes me
And my tomorrows long to be unknown
When all is shaken be my safety
In a world uncertain say you'll be my stone
Be my stone
In a world uncertain say you'll be my stone
Oh steady me
Be my source of gravity
While me world's unraveling
Say you'll never change
Oh oh
And I will follow where this takes me
And my tomorrows long to be unknown
When all is shaken be my safety
In a world uncertain say you'll be my stone
Be my stone
In a world uncertain say you'll be my stone
