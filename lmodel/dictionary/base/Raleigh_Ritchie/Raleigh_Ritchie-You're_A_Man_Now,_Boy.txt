<song artist="Raleigh_Ritchie" title="You're_A_Man_Now,_Boy">
Still got the same feet and the same hands
That I did when they made me, little man
But now I wear a suit and tie and Ray Bans
And I've swapped the fizzy drinks out for beer cans
I was a Small Soldier and I still am
Can't say what has changed apart from days and
I loved Jurassic Park, well, I still do
Actually, I'm the same except that now I take a pill or two
You're a man now, boy
You're a man now, boy
You're a man now, boy
You're a man now, boy
You're a man now, boy
You're a man now, boy
You're a man now, boy
You're a man now, boy
(I'm not growing up, I'm aging)
(My mind's incarcerated)
(Still a boy)
(You're a man now, boy)
(And though this body's taller)
(Sometimes I feel smaller)
(Just a boy)
(You're a man now, boy)
Pain is still a weakness, still afraid of ghosts
Still partial to a Mars Bar and a Sunday roast
Though now I have to think about the water bills
Still feel a pang of guilt about the snails I killed
I smoke too many cigarettes and drink too much
See the news and feel the blues, I'm feeling out of touch
I was an astronaut once upon a time
Now I'm tryna stay grounded, keep some order in my life
You're a man now, boy
You're a man now, boy
You're a man now, boy
You're a man now, boy
You're a man now, boy
You're a man now, boy
You're a man now, boy
You're a man now, boy
(I'm not growing up, I'm aging)
(My mind's incarcerated)
(Still a boy)
(You're a man now, boy)
(And though this body's taller)
(Sometimes I feel smaller)
(Just a boy)
(You're a man now, boy)
You're a man now, boy
You're a man now, boy
You're a man now, boy
You're a man now, boy
You're a man now, boy
You're a man now, boy
You're a man now, boy
You're a man now, boy
(I'm not growing up, I'm aging)
(My mind's incarcerated)
(Still a boy)
(You're a man now, boy)
(And though this body's taller)
(Sometimes I feel smaller)
(Just a boy)
(You're a man now, boy)
I'm not growing up, I'm aging
My mind's incarcerated
Just a boy
