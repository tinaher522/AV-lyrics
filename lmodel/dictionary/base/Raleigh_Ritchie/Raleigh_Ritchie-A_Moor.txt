<song artist="Raleigh_Ritchie" title="A_Moor">
Stuck in the middle with you
There's nowhere that I'd rather be
We could solve any riddle we choose
But we choose to stay away from the games we...
Move to the suburbs where grass goes
Away from the stubborn city assholes
Out to a world no-one else knows
Out to the meadows
Out to the sea
I don't really care what we do
But let's head to the wild, me and you
No stress, all bless, no blues
Let's take in the view
I said
Think about your heart, forget about your head
Cause if the rapture starts tomorrow we'll be dead
And if the world burns I wanna burn with it
I wanna go with you, exactly how we're livin'
But until that day I wanna love the minute
The hours, the seconds
And live without limits
Love every day, no matter what it takes
Throw everything at you until my heart breaks
If we get into a sticky situation
I wanna run away
I don't wanna be patient
No matter what the adversity we're facing
Time and space is the only thing we're racing
Maybe we could find a haven
Get lost, go ape
Weâ€™ll be so amazing
We could do what we wanted to do
Kick up a fuss and never trust what we knew
Try new things
New life, no strings
Even if our fights get raw
We'll brush it away
No strife, what for?
Kick off the door and leave
I want more
War...
War...
Let's go outside
Oh, oh
It's me and you
Oh, oh
