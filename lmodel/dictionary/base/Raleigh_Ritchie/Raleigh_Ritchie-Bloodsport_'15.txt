<song artist="Raleigh_Ritchie" title="Bloodsport_'15">
Nothing is perfect but your imperfections are quaint
And your love is worth it and for
That I will wait
And though you hate me
When you have a turn
I drive you crazy but you always return
If I fall short
If I break rank
It's a bloodsport
But I understand
I am all yours
I am unmanned
I'm on all fours Willingly down
Loving you is a bloodsport
Yeah! yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah! yeah, yeah, yeah
Fighting in a love war
Yeah! yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah! yeah, yeah, yeah
Although you love me
Sometimes we meet
Things can get ugly but
We're still a team
We are an army
The brakes are within
But that's why we're stronger
And that's how we'll win
If I fall short
If I break rank
It's a bloodsport
But I understand
I am all yours
I am unmanned
I'm on all fours Willingly down
Loving you is a bloodsport
Yeah! yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah! yeah, yeah, yeah
Fighting in a love war
Yeah! yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah! yeah, yeah, yeah
It's not what I'm in love for
I know But I don't know if you can't help it Baby, I'm just being selfish
Loving You Is a bloodsport
Yeah! yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah! yeah, yeah, yeah
I've got your back and though it's stacked against us
I've got your hand, it's us against consensus And I will burn
The people who hurt you the most and I will not learn
'Cause I am too young and too dumb to consider the terms
I'm breaking the law and
I'll curse the day that they return
With a smile on my face as their heads hit the floor
And it's done, now it's curtains
The blood lost, it's the cost, it fucking hurts But it's working and even if you ask me to stop it's too late
Because I've already decided that faith
Is not a distaste It's pure hate
And it pulsates and it works its way around my brain
And anyway, what I'm tryna say is
I'll protect you till the day I'll meet my maker
So don't fight me now 'cause you might need me later
Loving you is a bloodsport
Yeah! yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah! yeah, yeah, yeah
Fighting in a love war
Yeah! yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah! yeah, yeah, yeah
It's not what I'm in love for
I know But I don't know if you can't help it Baby, I'm just being selfish
Loving you is a bloodsport
Yeah! yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah! yeah, yeah, yeah
