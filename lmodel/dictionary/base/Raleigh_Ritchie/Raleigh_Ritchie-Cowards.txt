<song artist="Raleigh_Ritchie" title="Cowards">
Hi! Hey!
Hi! Okay!
I guess you're okay
You go through my head
Now and then
(Hi! Hey!
Hi! Okay!)
We watch what we say,
We play hard to get
We pretend
(Hi! Hey!
Hi! Okay!)
I don't what's happened to me
But it won't disappear
I'll keep changing,
Saying things I think you want to hear
I'm struggling to hold on to something close to you
Now I'm coming up short
I choose to make the most of you
Never mind the power
Never mind the games
You and me we're cowards
Never mind to share
'Cause I'll be waiting for you
At the burning gates
Baby, I adore you
But I'm afraid to say
I bite, and you scratch
We tend to relax
Perfect match
(Hi! Hey!
Hi! Okay!)
We're both self destruct
We fight and we fuck
We make love
(Hi! Hey!
Hi! Okay!)
I'm struggling to hold on to something close to you
Now I'm coming up short
I choose to make the most of you
Never mind the power
Never mind the games
You and me, we're cowards
Never mind to share
'Cause I'll be waiting for you
At the burning gates
Baby, I adore you
But I'm afraid to say
We don't have to be the model couple
We could just be modeled up
I won't give it up!
White flag on the night stand
White girl for the road
Baby, we were made to go surround each other
Baby, I don't know
I don't care
I'm just scared
Never mind the power
Never mind the games
You and me, we're cowards
Never mind to share
'Cause I'll be waiting for you
At the burning gates
Baby, I adore you
But I'm afraid to say
