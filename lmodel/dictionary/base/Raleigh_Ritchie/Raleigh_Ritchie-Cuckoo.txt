<song artist="Raleigh_Ritchie" title="Cuckoo">
Lord help me
I am crazy
I do the Devil's work 7 days a week
I'll go to church, I'll make my peace
I'm only young, I'll be forgiven
What's the point in fun if it's not forbidden?
On the other hand I'm a prideful man
I don't like not having a plan
I'm lazy, borderline crazy
Cuckoo, bananas, maybe, I don't give a damn
Who needs friends when you've got drugs?
Who needs meds when you've got love?
I don't care, cause I've got nothing
Left to do, I'll get through, though I'm
Cuckoo, cuckoo
Cuckoo, cuckoo
Insecure, not made of iron
I mess up for sport, not self-reliant
I'm sad as fuck and I'm feeling lonely
I keep throwing up, I'm not feeling rosy
I fake relief when I'm blatantly not
All vacant, I'm on a trip
I'm lazy, borderline crazy
Cuckoo, bananas, maybe, I'm sick of this shit
Who needs friends when you've got drugs?
Who needs meds when you've got love?
I don't care, cause I've got nothing
Left to do, I'll get through, though I'm
Cuckoo, cuckoo
Cuckoo, cuckoo
I've been taking time to discover what's underneath
I make the time move slower, it's a new division
Take me to a planet my mind's never abandoned
Sketch up what just happened, then paint that shit on a canvas
I got too many thoughts, distorting words as I talk
I'm a superhuman for sure, you will recognise that by force
You feel me? Raleigh played it for me, I just couldn't let it go
Hard as rock beneath the stone, this shit is just set in stone
Real truth, you will find hope in these verses
My verses is rodent killer for vermins, are you disturbed yet?
Space is all I know, you should know, have you not learned yet?
Park my presence in your presence, I don't need a permit
I don't have the time for these rappers, they better fall back
If you're gonna talk all that talk then you better walk that
Never thought that I would be a voice for a generation
Yet an entire nation, but still... who needs friends?
Who needs friends when you've got drugs?
Who needs meds when you've got love?
I don't care, cause I've got nothing
Left to do, I'll get through, though I'm
Cuckoo, cuckoo
Cuckoo, cuckoo
