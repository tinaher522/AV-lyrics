<song artist="Raleigh_Ritchie" title="Never_Say_Die">
I lost my mind in a nightclub bathroom
All I could find possessed no value
Too many times I said "never again"
Fooled me twice, all I have is my name
I'm a travelling journeyman like early man
Cave to cave and do it again, world's turning in on me
And it's spinning, so I heard again, hit the curb again
I'm a bum, burning out, international mystery men, I'm lonely now
I left my mind in Vegas
I left my mind in Reno
I left my mind in London
I left my heart in Rio
If I never make it through the night
Before I should die
Then if this is the last song I write
I lived my life
And I'mma live like a king if it kills me
I'm a kid, seven sins couldn't thrill me
When it's said and done, and I'm leaving home
I'mma rise again, and I'mma rise alone
I lost my soul on a roulette table
This never gets old, cause I'm unstable
Hit the ground running
It pulls me down, but I'm coming
I'm not unraveling, adrenaline, ketamine isn't my medicine
Living is better than methamphetamines
Fucking me up, just credit it "high on life", live twice
Never say die, I'm fine, I'll play the piper, whatever the price
I left my mind in LA (never say die)
I left my mind in Dallas
I left my mind in Bristol
I left my heart in Paris
If I never make it through the night
Before I should die
Then if this is the last song I write
I lived my life
And I'mma live like a king if it kills me
I'm a kid, seven sins couldn't thrill me
When it's said and done, and I'm leaving home
I'mma rise again, and I'mma rise alone
Run, run, run away
Run, run, run away
Running, ru-running away
Yeah
I lost my mind in Brighton
I lost my mind in Rome
I lost my mind in Sydney
I lost my heart in- fuck it, I never had a heart
Live another day
Another day
Gotta run away
Yeah
Live another day
Another day
Gotta run away
Yeah
Live another day
Another day
Gotta run away
Yeah
Live another day
Another day
Gotta run away
Yeah.
