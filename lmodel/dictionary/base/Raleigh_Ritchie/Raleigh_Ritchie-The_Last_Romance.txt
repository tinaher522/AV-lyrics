<song artist="Raleigh_Ritchie" title="The_Last_Romance">
Your face looks so sweet,
Even in the walls
You took the right from me,
But I fell on my own sword
And now the sword it details,
Roll over page four
Honey, we made the news and that's all we did this for
We drove the centuries without a sound of us
State penitentiary we made for souls like us
There will be blood,
But you will be loved
The world will know,
But it's only us
Will I lay me down?
I pray we keep each day,
Please stay with me
You paint the town red,
Now everyone in town is dead
You and I win again,
Best friends till our last breathe
Live by the gun,
Die by the gun
Live by the sea,
Live while we're young
Take from the rich, give to the poor
Run to the hills,
Run from the lord
Righteous come with the crossbow
Head out North where the sun grows
Start fresh where they don't know
The things we did stick our kids
We laughed,
We cried
We lived,
We died
We came,
We saw
We conquered them all
Will I lay me down?
I pray we keep each day,
Please stay with me
Don't listen to what they say,
Don't take the medication
They never loved us anyway
Never liked our generation
They will try and keep you
But you're still mine
And I love you,
And you're strong there
And we're fine
So remember when the time comes
When it's over and it's all done
Meet me in the North,
By the edge of the sun
Will I lay me down?
I pray we keep each day,
Please stay with me
