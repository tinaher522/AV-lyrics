<song artist="Raleigh_Ritchie" title="You_Make_It_Worse">
I can read you like a book
I don't need to say it twice, I never cared for being bright
Bait is on the hook, I don't even wanna bite
I don't wanna give a monkey's, I
Can't keep you back, can't reign you in
Can't fade to black, can't let you win
When nothing works
When nothing works for me
You make it hurt
You make it worse for me
And I let myself down
You make it worse
You make it worse for me
To you it's all a game, but all I do is analyse
Words that make me rot inside
To you it's all the same, I'm just a human sacrifice
Use me like a parasite
Can't keep you back, can't reign you in
Can't fade to black, can't let you win
When nothing works
When nothing works for me
You make it hurt
You make it worse for me
And I let myself down
You make it worse
You make it worse for me
You were supposed to make it easy, we were supposed to be a team
We were supposed to live some kind of dream, but in the scheme of things
You only wanna scheme
Are you some kind of creep? Words are cheap
When nothing works
When nothing works for me
You make it hurt
You make it worse for me
And I let myself down
You make it worse
You make it worse for me
