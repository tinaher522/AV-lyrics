<song artist="Raleigh_Ritchie" title="The_Greatest">
Danger, warning, good morning
Is it dark outside or light?
Last night was sordid, but we conquered the boredom
We wanna be cool and liked, but you won't see me calling
Don't wanna make this awkward
I'm feeling nauseous
And I'm seeing four of us
But we came with five
And we don't waste time
We'll live or die
When we choose like
We'll be dancing forever, we don't know any better
We're lazy, whatever, at least we stick together
We're the greatest, I mean it, we'll never be defeated
You can take us or leave us, we don't care if you believe us
One drink, two drink, we're young, we're stupid
Who the fuck knows what they're doing?
Life is boring, and we can barely afford it
We've been blinded, assuming that this won't be our downfall
When we work for the council
Stuck with a houseful of kids that we now adore
But we made on a whim, though we fade and we dim
We're amazing and slim, the queens and the kings
We'll be dancing forever, we don't know any better
We're lazy, whatever, at least we stick together
We're the greatest, I mean it, we'll never be defeated
You can take us or leave us, we don't care if you believe us
See you in the same place when we're 83
We're gonna live forever
Even if I fall in love and have kids, will you wait for me?
We'll go hell for leather
Taking a tally of every day we lost
Taking a vacay, taking a sick day and we're off
When we're old men, we'll be lost
Doing our rounds of paying the cost
We're way past the sunshine and ice cream
I pray it's not a pipe dream
As dumb as it might seem
When we're grown up, will you still me?
We'll be dancing forever, we don't know any better
We're lazy, whatever, at least we stick together
We're the greatest, I mean it, we'll never be defeated
You can take us or leave us, we don't care if you believe us
We'll be dancing forever, we don't know any better
We're lazy, whatever, at least we stick together
We're the greatest, I mean it, we'll never be defeated
You can take us or leave us, we don't care if you believe us
