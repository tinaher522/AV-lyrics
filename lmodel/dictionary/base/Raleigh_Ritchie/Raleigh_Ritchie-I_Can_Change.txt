<song artist="Raleigh_Ritchie" title="I_Can_Change">
See, I like drinking till I get blind drunk
Blackout and lash out, and act like a punk
Crash few times with my fake ID
And up face-down with my NTD
Hangover, bed bound soldier
Hun runs over, the dip in her shoulder
With her I see things clearly
Easy my mind, I'll ease my fear
Though my life so far is blurry
I'll be fine if I keep her near me
I don't need to fight in tears
I don't even like my???
We're so far away from here
We're so far away from here
When I think about my baby
I get a bit insecure
I need to be seen as a little bit more mature
I need you around my baby
I'm sure I can change, I can change
I just have to get rid off all that excess pain
Everything's right, so start things going my way
She's right here for me
See, I'm out of my mind when it comes to getting loud
I'm not a bad man, but I'll still knock you out
Boy, listen, don't try it triple daddy, fuck a diet, see my lady
She's an angel, she's a rockstar, but she stays low
She got eyes that can hide the entire population
But I get tired of the situation, it ain't enough
I don't want to change, all I want make a couple???
So that she can see that this world we're living can be fucking tough
I mean it though, this road is cold
Only the brave survive when they sold their souls
This is my audience, I just hope that she can keep up with me
This is my calling, it's a shame I'm stepping
When I think about my baby
I get a bit insecure
I need to be seen as a little bit more mature
I need you around my baby
I'm sure I can change, I can change
I just have to get rid off all that excess pain
Everything's right, so start things going my way
She's right here for me
Mr. officer, I'm a man of values
Yes, I might've dropped one or two Valium
Look, I don't want to rock
I'm just a catch of abusers
So reviews??
Don't be confused, say not being rude, sir
Live this life in the dust, I'm a loser
I'm a loser, I'm a fucking loser
When I think about my baby
I get a bit insecure
I need to be seen as a little bit more mature
I need you around my baby
I'm sure I can change, I can change
I just have to get rid off all that excess pain
Everything's right, so start things going my way
She's right here for me
