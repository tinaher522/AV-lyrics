<song artist="Raleigh_Ritchie" title="Stay_Inside">
Drugs and girls, life and death
Is all that goes through my head
I shrink the world, nothing left
I'll sleep when I am dead
Blame me, I'm not playing ball
Hate me, it's insatiable
Not lazy, I just can't face it all
And I can't
And I won't
And I don't know
When the under dogs rise again, I'll have my time
When my body starts turning in, I'll have my mind
Nothing is getting in, not even light
I'm gonna stay inside, stay inside
TV news, frozen food, in here my life's not hard
I don't use the bed in my room
Cause I don't wanna drop my guard
Judge me, I will understand
I'm ugly, only half a man
It's your country, and I'm contraband
Love me and I'll leave your land
When the under dogs rise again, I'll have my time
When my body starts turning in, I'll have my mind
Nothing is getting in, not even light
I'm gonna stay inside, stay inside
How can I please you, when I can't please myself?
I've given up on what you call living
I have not yet forgiven myself
When the under dogs rise again, I'll have my time
When my body starts turning in, I'll have my mind
Nothing is getting in, not even light
I'm gonna stay inside, stay inside
Stay inside, stay inside
Stay inside, stay inside
