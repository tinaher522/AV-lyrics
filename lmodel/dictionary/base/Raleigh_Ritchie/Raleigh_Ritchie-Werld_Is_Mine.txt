<song artist="Raleigh_Ritchie" title="Werld_Is_Mine">
I wanna live forever
I wanna be your friend
I wanna rule together
I wanna be your pair
I wanna make some money, money, money
I wanna make some time
I wanna be your buddy
Well, honey, this werld is mine
This werld is mine
I'm stuck stuck on the loop
And I can't break it
Truth is I can't state it
For you to be free is pain
And I can't wait
I can't do right without do wrong
Keep quiet or retire
Be cool and move on
Don't want the inside riot
Wanna eat to them green
Living clean with a diet, oh
Fuck skeem rational time though
Feet don't fail me now,
I just wanna go
Uh, the beating's over
I've never felt so alone
Oh, so keep me closer
Why do I feel so low?
Sticks and stones
Some broken bones
Are in for,
Are we gonna get any better?
I wanna live forever
I wanna be your friend
I wanna rule together
I wanna be your pair
I wanna make some money, money
I wanna waste some time
I wanna bo your buddy, but honey
This werld is mine
This werld is mine
Take, take me away 'cause I don't want to wait
See another day
Strange I get the chains
Don't mind either way
Tryina reach so close to insanity
Is it me? Could've been,
I'm too young, I'm too pretty
Uh, the beating's over
I've never felt so alone
Oh, so keep me closer
Don't want to feel the cold
Sticks and stones
Some broken bones
Are in for,
Are we gonna get any better?
I wanna live forever
I wanna be your friend
I wanna rule together
I wanna be your pair
I wanna make some money, money
I wanna waste some time
I wanna bo your buddy, but honey
This werld is mine
This werld is mine
I wanna live forever
I wanna be spear
I wanna be better
I wanna be scared
This werld is mine
This werld is mine
