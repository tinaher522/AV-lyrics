<song artist="Raleigh_Ritchie" title="Young_&_Stupid">
Nobody grows, nobody makes the rules
Nobody's home, don't wanna stay in school
I'm ready to go, I'll be your favourite fool
Nobody knows I am unbreakable
I'm the brand new happy-go-lucky me, lucky you
I don't know, man, maybe soon I'll be the smartest in the room
Settling down will never do, I don't wanna lose my worldly view
I don't wanna be defined by what I knew
Show me life, show me love
Give me time, cause I'm untouched
I'm young and I'm stupid
I need a rush, some luck, some love when I'm unsteady
Cause I'm young and I'm ruthless
I'm gonna live by the gun and die when I am ready
I'll be a star, I'll be the boy who lived
Taking my car and driving it off the bridge
Empty the bar, drinking until I'm sick
I'll see you in Mars, I'm coming off the grid
I'm the brand new happy-go-lucky me, lucky you
I don't know, man, maybe soon I'll be the smartest in the room
Settling down will never do, I don't wanna lose my worldly view
I don't wanna be defined by what I knew
Show me life, show me love
Give me time, cause I'm untouched
I'm young and I'm stupid
I need a rush, some luck, some love when I'm unsteady
Cause I'm young and I'm ruthless
I'm gonna live by the gun and die when I am ready
Everything is blowing up, and I don't wanna let it
I've been so quick to grow up and I don't really get it
Everybody's telling me the person I should be
But I just wanna see the world and be a human being
Love, hate, make money
And spend it all on alcohol
And I can't wait, I'm running
I feel my mind's about to blow, show, show, show
Show me life, show me love
Give me time, cause I'm untouched
I'm young and I'm stupid
I need a rush, some luck, some love when I'm unsteady
Cause I'm young and I'm ruthless
I'm gonna live by the gun and die when I am ready
