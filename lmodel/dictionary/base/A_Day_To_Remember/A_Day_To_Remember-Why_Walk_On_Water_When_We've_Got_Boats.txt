<song artist="A_Day_To_Remember" title="Why_Walk_On_Water_When_We've_Got_Boats">
Watch what you say on the stand. You're running in circles.
I know more than you think and your words are empty.
Of all the heavenly host's!
This will all make sense when the records gold.
What's a few more units for your soul?
You're waisting my time,
While there waisting away.
You'll never, you'll never save me.
You've dropped every line,
But they don't mean a thing.
You'll never, you'll never save me.
You live your life in the saddest way I've ever seen.
You are the reason i don't believe.
I'm not denying the worth of things unseen,
And this isn't a part of the next big thing.
I'm just dying to show them all that you are.
You are nothing.
