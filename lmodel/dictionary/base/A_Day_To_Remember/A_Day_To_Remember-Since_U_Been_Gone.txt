<song artist="A_Day_To_Remember" title="Since_U_Been_Gone">
Here's the thing, we started out friends
It was cool but it was all pretend
Yeah Yeah
Since U Been Gone
You dedicated, you took the time
Wasn't long till I called you mine
Yeah Yeah
Since U Been Gone
And all you'd ever hear me say
Is how I picture me with you
That's all you'd ever hear me say
But Since U Been Gone
I can breathe for the first time
I'm so moving on
Yeah Yeah
Thanks to you
Now I get
What I want
Since U Been Gone
How can I put it? You put me on
I even fell for the stupid love song
Yeah Yeah
Since U Been Gone
HOW COME I'D NEVER HEAR YOU SAY
I JUST WANNA BE WITH YOU
I GUESS YOU NEVER FELT THAT WAY
But Since U Been Gone
I can breathe for the first time
I'm so moving on
Yeah Yeah
Thanks to you
Now I get
I get what I want
Since U Been Gone
You had your chance you blew it
Out of sight, out of mind
Shut your mouth I just can't take it
Again and again and again and again
OH! Oh!
Since U Been Gone (Since U Been Gone)
I can breathe for the first time
I'm so moving on
Yeah Yeah
Thanks to you (Thanks to you)
Now I get, I get what I want 
What I want
I can breathe for the first time
I'M SO MOVING ON
I'm so moving on
Yeah Yeah
Thanks to you 
Thanks to you
Now I get 
Now I get
You should know 
You should know
That I get 
I get what I want
Since U Been Gone
Since U Been Gone
Since U Been Gone
