<song artist="A_Day_To_Remember" title="If_Looks_Could_Kill...Then_I'd_Be_Dead">
Somethings wrong and its not me for once, 
And I know youll call me crazy
But I hate the way you look straight through me. 
What have I done thats so wrong? 
Remember me when Im so far from your reach, 
When youll know you had your chance. 
Take one more glance, and thats the end of our romance.
Youve turned your back on me for the last time.
Remember when we use to be friends? 
Nothing could ever go wrong, or so we thought, 
But I guess youve changed a lot since we were young. 
Times will change, and theres nothing I can say to right all of your wrongs. 
Just grow up, and pray well keep in touch.
Youve turned your back on me for the last time.
I still dream of the day that I watched you choke. 
Theyll act like Im so crazy when they find you dead on my floor. 
Right now.
Id say something went wrong in our lives, and I pray that god saves us before we die.
Hes everything that you could never be.
Right now.
Id say something went wrong in our lives, and I pray that god saves us before we die.
Slowly die.
