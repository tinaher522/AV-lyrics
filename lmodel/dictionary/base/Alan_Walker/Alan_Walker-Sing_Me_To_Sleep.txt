<song artist="Alan_Walker" title="Sing_Me_To_Sleep">
Wait a second, let me catch my breath
Remind me how it feels to hear your voice
Your lips are movin', I can't hear a thing
Livin' life as if we had a choice
Anywhere, any time
I would do anything for you
Anything for you
Yesterday got away
Melody stuck inside your head
A song in every breath
Sing me to sleep now
Sing me to sleep
So sing me to sleep now
Sing me to sleep
Remember me, no time cannot erase
I can hear your whispers in my mind
I've become what you cannot embrace
Our memory will be my lullaby
Sing me to sleep now
Sing me to sleep
Won't you sing me to sleep now?
Sing me to sleep
A-anytime
I would do
Time away
Yesterday-day
A-anytime
I would do
Time away
Yesterday-day
