<song artist="Tristan_Prettyman" title="God_Gave_Me_Patience">
God gave me patience
Patience to breath
God give me reasons
To not cry anymore about anything
God give me time
Time to think this through
God give me something
Something to keep my mind
Off missing you
And in the afternoon while the sun gets low
I wish I there was some other direction to drive
Somewhere else to go
But there's always one more thing I have to prove
There's always part of me missing you
So light the day
And invite me to stay
'Cause now I see
I was always on my way
Just a little late
Cause I cry lot
I cry out of fear
And it'd be nice if
You was all that made up these tears
But its years and years
And in the afternoon while the sun gets low
I wish I there was some direction to drive
Somewhere else to go
But if you never try
You'll never know
Sometimes the best part of goodbye
Is letting go
Oh, but I've been dreaming of clear skies
Oh, I've been dreaming of hometown coastlines
I would fly
So God give me patience
Patience to see
Within the chaos
There's always room to dream
Just let it be
