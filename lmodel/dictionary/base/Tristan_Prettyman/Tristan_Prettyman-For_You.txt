<song artist="Tristan_Prettyman" title="For_You">
You wanna play the song that breaks my heart 
you want her to hear the words that tear me apart 
how did you do this to me? 
you know you got me right where I'd want you to be 
The hard to get make you wait game seems to work 
though in the end I know I'll only end up hurt 
I'd probably be here if she would have left 
and I bet, forever you would have kept me but 
if it wasn't for you, i'd have nothing to say 
and if it wasn't for reason, I could make this all go away 
and if it wasn't for you I might never have tried 
and if it wasn't for you and her I may have never realized 
Let the months pass, let the hurt start to feel 
I've come to my senses, this is f**ked up but its real 
you'll break her heart just like you did mine 
your love is weak, its only a matter of time... 
if it wasn't for you, i'd have nothing to say 
and if it wasn't for reason, I could make this all go away 
and if it wasn't for you I might never have tried 
and if it wasn't for you and her I may have never realized
