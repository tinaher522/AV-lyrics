Oh, oh ohh, oh ohh, oh ohh
Oh, oh ohh, oh ohh, oh ohh
OK, so maybe
We're not meant to be
And the thing I feel
Is just a karmic thing
But I never loved the way I loved you
And I don't think my heart has ever been so true
'Cause I just can't seem to shake, wake, break it, or quit you
Oh ohh, no, I can't quit you, oh ohh
I cannot sleep, when it's your lovin' I miss
You're like a fever that I'm coming down with
You said a lie, but I'm never heard no
You said to jump, but I never let go
'Cause I just can't seem to shake, wake, break it, or quit you
Oh ohh, no, I can't quit you, oh ohh
What will it take to make you see
If only you would just choose me, oh
I'd love till the day I die
Then, forever, I will be satisfied
I'd be satisfied.
Well, it'd be easier if you were just some guy
From some other town who didn't live close by
But you got me good and I can't quit now,
Yeah, I'm hooked on you and I'm freaking out
Because I just can't seem to shake, wake, break it, or quit you
Oh ohh, no, I can't quit you, oh ohh
'Cause I just can't, just can't, seem to, seem to
I just can't, just can't, seem to, seem to
I just can't, seem to shake, wake, break it, or quit you
Oh ohh, 'cause I can't quit you, oh ohh
No, I can't quit you
and I'm always gonna miss you,
and I'm always gonna love you
Oh ohh
'Cause I can't quit you
Oh ohh
'Cause I just can't seem to shake wake break it or quit you
