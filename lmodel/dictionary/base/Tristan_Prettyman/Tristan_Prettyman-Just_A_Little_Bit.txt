<song artist="Tristan_Prettyman" title="Just_A_Little_Bit">
These days 'round 3 o'clock
Rain does start to fall
Downpour on the whole damn block
So loud on brick walls
Don't go making this easy
Don't go making it hard
'Cause when you come around, eyes so blue
You know I can't ignore, you know I can't ignore
'Cause you got something I want
Just a little bit
You got something I need
Just a little bit
No matter how hard I try to fight it
You're gonna bring this girl to her knees
'Cause everybody got places to go
And people to see
Everybody got plenty of time
But they don't know how to set it free
So why don't you come back
Come back to me
Baby come on back, oh
Come back to me
'Cause you got something I wanted
Just a little bit
You got something I need
Just a little bit
No matter how hard I try to fight it
You're gonna bring this girl to her knees
Yes, you're gonna bring this girl to her knees
Yes, you're gonna bring this girl to her knees
Yes, you're gonna bring this girl to her knees
Bring this girl to her knees
Bringing it up, bringing it down to her knees
Bringing it up, bringing it down to her knees
Bringing it up and bringing it down to my knees
Come on, bringing it up and bringing it down to my knees, oh
Yes you're gonna
Bringing it up and bringing it down to my knees, oh
Yes you're gonna
Bringing it up and bringing it down to my knee, oh
Yes you're gonna
Bringing it up and bringing it down to my knees
