<song artist="Tristan_Prettyman" title="Say_Anything">
If I could say anything, anything
What would it be?
Good question for our destined reality
I would tell you that I love you
Even when it didn't show
I would tell you that I love you, baby
By now I hope you know
If you could go anywhere, anywhere
What would you see?
Take a step in any direction
It's make believe
If your mind is always moving
It's hard to get your heart up off the ground
Yeah, your mind was always moving
Your thoughts never made a sound
We won't break, if we let go
You and I already know
We were bound to be set free
Eventually, so here we are now
You can say anything
If I could have it go any way, any way
It'd go like this
Take it back to a couple years yesterday
To our first kiss
In that moment I loved you
This isn't how I ever saw it going down
In that moment I loved you
I wish I knew then what I know now
We won't break if we let go
You and I already know
We were bound to be set free
Eventually, so here we are now
You can say anything
You can say anything
Oh, you should listen to your heart
(You should listen to your heart)
It's gonna tell you what you need
(It's gonna tell you what you need)
Take care of yourself
(Take care of yourself)
Don't you worry 'bout me
Oh, you should listen to your heart
(You should listen to your heart)
Oh, it's gonna tell you what you need
(It's gonna tell you what you need)
Take care of yourself
(Take care of yourself)
Don't you worry 'bout me
We won't break if we let go
You and I already know
We were bound to be set free
Eventually, so here we are now
You can say anything
You can say anything
You can say anything
You can say anything
Always say anything
