<song artist="Tristan_Prettyman" title="Bad_Drug">
Give me to me in the morning
Not the evening, know I need it again
Give me to me in the morning
Not the evening, know I need it again
Make me want it, got to have it
I need, you know that I need it so bad
Make me want it, got to have it
I need, you know that I need it so bad
Set the tip of my tongue
On the top of my
Stepping on my toes
You hang around me like a
Bad, bad, bad, bad drug, drug,
on the streets, all the DJ's playing this, this
And on middle of the night
You hang around me like a
Bad, bad, bad, bad drug, drug,
Bad, bad, bad, bad drug, drug,
Give me to me in the morning
Not the evening, know I need it again
Give me to me in the morning
Not the evening, know I need it again
Make me want it, got to have it
I need, you know that I need it so bad
Make me want it, got to have it
I need, you know that I need you so bad
So bad
Why I need you like a bad, bad, bad drug
Like the cold going on strong
Touch you like a hot butt
Touch you all night long
Gotta call my friends
They be at it again
Got the dogs, got the drugs and the keys to my benz
Checking hands, shaking like a
Keep it like a secret, plus the 20 game play while the topics do
Gotta take my time, can't rush it like it happens over night
Yeah I do that shit every
If it comes to this
Yeah I do that shit every
If it comes to this
Give me to me in the morning
Not the evening, know I need it again
Give me to me in the morning
Not the evening, know I need it again
Make me want it, got to have it
I need, you know that I need it so bad
Make me want it, got to have it
I need, you know that I need you so bad
So bad
Why I need you like a bad, bad, bad drug
Yeah I do that shit.
