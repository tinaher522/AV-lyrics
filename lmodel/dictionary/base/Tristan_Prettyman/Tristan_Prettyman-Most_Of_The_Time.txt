<song artist="Tristan_Prettyman" title="Most_Of_The_Time">
I am crazy most of the time 
but I am simple in this restless mind of mine 
give me something that can grow 
a love that I will always know 
you make this girl shine 
almost all of the time 
like a letter sealed with a kiss 
this is a love I love to miss 
and if only I could find 
the type of words to describe 
I'd probably take up all of your time 
all your time 
never mind the secrets that you keep 
cause I wanna know what it takes to move the ground beneath your feet 
I wanna see a smile that laughs 
let you have my better half 
cause you make that girl shine 
almost all of the time 
like a letter sealed with a kiss 
this is a love I love to miss 
and if only I could find 
the type of words to describe 
id probably take up all of your time 
all your time 
I am shy most of the time 
but I'm a quiet in this busy mind of mine
