<song artist="Tristan_Prettyman" title="Crazy">
You know I love the way my hand fits in yours 
cause I've been down for so long and you're my cure 
but you're driving me crazy, completely crazy 
I cant get enough, cause you amaze me 
every time you look my way, I don't know what to say, to you... 
now your breaking girls hearts like a habit 
like you lost all the trust in this world 
but maybe I have it 
tell me, what makes an ocean 
different from a sea 
what did you loose in her, that you found in me 
so long ago, so long ago 
you set me free 
might as well be just as scared as you are 
cause who'd of thought we woulda made it this far 
but you've been f**ked up every time 
so I guess, really you were never mine 
cause baby 
you cant find me 
you cant deny me 
when you look at me 
you look past me 
and you lost me 
completely 
but still I love the way your eyes look in mine 
and its too bad we can feel this way all the time 
cause the breath between our lips 
when we kiss 
is something I hope I never have to miss 
but your driving me crazy 
completely crazy 
every time 
I'm looking at you but your looking at her 
I guess I was blind, cause you always were 
you've already given up on me 
so long ago, so long ago, you set me free
