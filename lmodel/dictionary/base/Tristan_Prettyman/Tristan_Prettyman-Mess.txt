<song artist="Tristan_Prettyman" title="Mess">
I take a breath and I sigh
And this time I won't ask why
'Cause I'm runnin from the things that I cannot hide
And this time
Reminds me of last time
And I watch you pack your bags
Get in the car
Drive away and if I could
Well I wouldn't make you stay
'Cause it's better if you go
It's better if nobody knows
What a mess you make of me
'Cause you and your goodbyes
And though I tried, I tried, I tried so many times
Oh well it's just something that gets me every time
Oh and this is nothing new
And I'll be fine
'Cause you said you miss me more when I go
Well is that so
'Cause well I've been gone for quite some time
But the mood in the room and I'm consumed
With you every time
You take my breath away
'Cause you and your goodbyes
And though I tried, I tried, I tried so many times
Oh well it's just something that gets me every time
Oh and it's nothing new and I'll be fine
I know
'Cause you and your goodbyes
And though I tried, I tried, I tried so many times
Oh well it's just something that gets me every time
Oh well there's nothing new and I'll be fine
Yeah there's nothing new and I'll be fine
