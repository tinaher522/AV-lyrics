<song artist="Tristan_Prettyman" title="Hummingbirds">
Take all the time you need
We get distracted all the time
And lately I can't stand sleep
Yeah, I got clouds in my eyes
Wake up wake up
How did we get so far
Wake up wake up
Away from where we are
Time stands still in the hours of the night
I couldn't get this right if I tried
Hummingbirds don't make a sound
They're gone as fast as they came
And love is swarming all around
But it still looks the same to me
Wake up wake up
How did we get so far
Wake up wake up
Away from where we are
Time stands still in the hours of the night
I couldn't get this right if I tried
Wake up wake up
How did we get so far
Wake up wake up
Away from where we are
Time stands still in the hours of the night
I couldn't get this right if I tried
