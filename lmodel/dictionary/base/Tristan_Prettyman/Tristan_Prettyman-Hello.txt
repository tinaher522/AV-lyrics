<song artist="Tristan_Prettyman" title="Hello">
Hello, I've had you on my mind
For hours there's no doubt
There's no use wasting time
Hello, how could I ever feel this way?
With so much left to say
So much on my mind
I know theres no use
In trying harder
I got to gage and barter to get out
'Cause baby you start and then you stop
And my heart beats big before it drops
And I dont know what to do
Uh uh uh
Uh uh uh
Uh uh uh, uh
Sit back,
Let me love grow good for you
Hello, my God you're beautiful
It's true, everyday I stumble
Getting caught up on you
Now I, I never been so amused
There ain't nothing left to prove
I ain't got nothing to loose
'Cause baby, I've been lightly drinking
And a little bit too heavy on the thinking
Won't you tell me something good
'Cause baby you start
And then you stop
And my heart beats big before it drops
And I dont know what's to do
Uh uh uh
Uh uh uh
Uh uh uh, uh
Sit back
And let my love grow good for you
Sit back
And let my love grow good for you
So baby whatcha waiting,
Whatcha waiting, whatcha waiting for?
