<song artist="Tristan_Prettyman" title="Something_In_The_Way">
there's always something in the way 
telling me that I should stay 
there's always something new your holding on too 
and I just cant seem to see it through 
cause when you opened my eyes to 
a little bit of perfection 
I must have forgot to mention 
that your the love of my life 
something about this isn't right 
there's always something in my head 
the words that stick before I go to bed 
I find them now 
but later I cant get them out 
so I just smile instead 
so when you opened me up to 
a little bit of perfection 
I'm sure I forgot to mention 
that your the love of my life 
something about this can't be right 
did you ever wonder where you'd be 
if you weren't here now 
and have you ever watched someone's eyes light up 
by the words come out of your mouth 
have you ever seen a sunset while your driving south 
well I do, I see it all so clearly now 
cause it opened my eyes up to another direction 
I think I forgot to mention, that this is me living my life 
and for once it all feels right
