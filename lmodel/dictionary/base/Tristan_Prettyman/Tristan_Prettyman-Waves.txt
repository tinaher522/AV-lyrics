<song artist="Tristan_Prettyman" title="Waves">
I can be a handful
I can be a nightmare
I can get a little crazy
A little high maintenance
Hanging with the cool kids
Naw, it ain't gonna be easy
But I could be your best friend
Loyal till the day ends
Like you never knew you deserved it
Yeah you know its all worth it
Yeah, you make it all worth it
Oh Oh Oh
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh
It comes in waves
It comes in waves
Oh Oh Oh
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh
It comes in waves
Sometimes I wanna peace out
Press pause, rewind,
Take a drive, turn it all down
Other times I just sit back/get mad
Throw words like knives
Not caring where they might land
Even on the worst day
Know that you still got me
Know that what we got I wouldn't hurt it
You know its all worth it
Yeah, you make it all worth it
Oh Oh Oh
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh
It comes in waves
It comes in waves
Oh Oh Oh
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh
It comes in waves
It comes in waves
Your patience
My promise
This love will be honest
Forever and always
This love we will keep safe
Your patience
My promise
This love will be honest
Forever and always
This love we will keep safe
Oh Oh Oh
Oh Oh OH OH OH
It comes in waves
It comes in waves
Oh Oh Oh
OH OH OH OH OH
It comes in waves
It comes in waves
