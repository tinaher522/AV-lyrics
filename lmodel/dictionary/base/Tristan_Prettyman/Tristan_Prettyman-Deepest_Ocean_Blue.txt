<song artist="Tristan_Prettyman" title="Deepest_Ocean_Blue">
I tried to push your memory away
But I need it for a cozy rainy day
You're on my mind, all the time
Dropped you off on the out skirts of town
And drive a couple miles had to turn away
It's not the same, when you're away
And darling I don't know what to do
'Cause from the deepest ocean blue
To the fullest golden moon
What am I to do with all this love for you
From the stars up in the sky
To the humming railroad lines
Up and over time, my love for you
You were a match and I was gasoline
And I was sure you'd be the end of me
So I killed the flame and I walked away
Ain't it funny how you never really know
You never really want it till you finally let it go
Come back to me and I swear you'll see
This much I know is true
'Cause from the deepest ocean blue
To the fullest golden moon
What am I to do with all this love for you
From the stars up in the sky
To the humming railroad lines
Up and over time, my love for you
You might not feel the same
I know sometimes people change and if that's how you feel
I'll be okay
But someday, yeah maybe some day
From the deepest ocean blue
To the fullest golden moon
What am I to do with all this love for you
From the stars up in the sky
To the humming railroad lines
Up and over time, my love for you
Up and over time, my love for you
Up and over time, my love for you
