<song artist="Tristan_Prettyman" title="My_Oh_My">
You got my heart on a string 
You want me back again and you know I’ll do anything
Just when I thought I was free
Knock, knock, the door is locked
But you still got a key
All too familiar, the moment it shows up
Now everything I know seems to fly
My oh my
You’re getting under my skin
Don’t know why I’m always letting you in
Just when I got my life together again, 
Here you are standing there 
Tell me why I should try
My oh my
My oh my
My oh my
My oh my
You got me under a spell 
You look like heaven, oh, but you put me through hell
God knows there’s nothing to gain 
Well who am I to deny, we’re both playing the same game 
All too familiar, the moment it blows up
Now everything I know seems to fly
My oh my
You’re getting under my skin
Don’t know why I’m always letting you in
Just when I got my life together again, 
Here you are standing there 
Tell me why I should try
My oh my
My oh my
My oh my
My oh my
And I know that you’re no good for me
And it makes no sense at all
Still I keep coming back for more 
‘Cause I’m addicted to your call
I know you ain’t no good for me
And all the lies and the lines you fed to me
The way you kept coming back for me 
Like the last breath left of the air I need 
I know you ain’t no good for me
And all the lies and the lines you fed to me
The way you kept coming back for me 
Like the last breath left of the air I need
My oh my
You’re getting under my skin
Don’t know why I’m always letting you in
Just when I got my life together again, 
Here you are standing there 
Tell me why I should try
My oh my
My oh my
My oh my
My oh my
My oh my
My oh my
My oh my
My oh my
My oh my 
I know you ain’t no good for me
And all the lies and the lines you fed to me
