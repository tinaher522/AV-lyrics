Well, it's 4 AM,
The paper boy's at it again, but I can't get no sleep.
I mean what's the point,
If I can't even dream up a dream that's worth the keep?
And so there's no need even going,
'Cause I'm better off never knowing.
The media are getting really good at lying,
This time around, well I'm not buying it.
'Cause this life is a beautiful one,
And though I see it coming undone.
I know most definitely,
That it's gonna be you, it's gonna be me soon.
Better keep your head up, keep it on the up and up,
'Cause you've got all my love, love, love.
We're all just lovers and takers,
Breaking hearts to make the papers.
She won't stop until we stop trying,
'Cause the reasons for your tears aren't worth crying.
And this life is a beautiful one,
And though I see it coming undone.
I know most definitely,
That it's gonna be you, it's gonna be me soon.
Better keep your head up, keep it on the up and up,
'Cause you've got all my love, love, love.
With loving all around me,
Well I think that love has found me.
With loving all the time.
And when the summer's here, the waves are crashing.
No time for thinking, don't even ask me.
Gonna let it all roll right past me.
Cause when I'm here I'm always something.
This life is a beautiful one,
And though I see it coming undone.
I know most definitely,
It always works out the way it's meant to be.
So better keep your head up, keep it on the up and up,
'Cause you've got all my love, love, love.
