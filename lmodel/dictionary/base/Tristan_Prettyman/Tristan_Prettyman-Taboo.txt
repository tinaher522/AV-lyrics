<song artist="Tristan_Prettyman" title="Taboo">
Hey you,
I see you across the room
I know what I'd like do
I'm keeping my eyes on you
Your smile, its catching me by surprise
Maybe we should take a drive
I feel like walking on the wrong side
It's not like me, to do things like this
But I really, oh I can't resist
Its a feeling, that I won't deny
I'm breakin' all the rules, and I wanna start a fire
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh
Taboo
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh
Taboo
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh
Taboo
Breakin' all the rules, and I wanna start a fire
Hey you,
I don't need to know your name
Or from whatever town you came
I could care less about your profile
Cause I know, when I see something I like
Yeah I could keep ya up all night
A story you could tell your whole life
It's not like me, to do things like this
But I really, Oh I can't resist
Its a feeling, that I won't deny
I'm breakin' all the rules, and I wanna start a fire
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh
Taboo
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh
Taboo
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh
Taboo
Breakin' all the rules, and I wanna start a fire
