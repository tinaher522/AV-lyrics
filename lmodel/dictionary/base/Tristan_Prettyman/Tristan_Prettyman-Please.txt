<song artist="Tristan_Prettyman" title="Please">
Such a crime
I don't remember being taken
This love was meant for
Wandering eyes and fakin'
So hot the way you looking
And when he's on it, man he's running and he's booking
Didn't know what to think in the beginning
But you got me so wet
And then you left me swimming
Keep it coming with the love I can't resist
I'm so tired but don't you dare quit
'Cause it's a lie, it's a crime and it's just something
That I can't deny but
You know it looks so good from the outside
It's a mistake that I'm willing to make
And a promise that I just might break but
Gotta find out how much my heart can take
From the moment I met you
I knew this love was bound to get you
Well I know I know I know you're weak that way
Looking out the window and it's only the beginning
People are talking
And my ears start ringing
But I don't care what they say
'Cause they'll never know me anyway
'Cause it's a lie, it's a crime and it's just something
That I can't deny but
You know it looks so good from the outside
It's a mistake that I'm willing to make
And a promise that I just might break
Gotta find out how much my heart can take
And I know what he wants
And I know what he needs
I got the type of love
That's gonna bring you right down to your knees
Bring you right down to your knees
I'm begging you oh please
I want to be the lover
For your cover
How could you deny
This love so great
Love so grand
If you don't understand
That this love will take you make you
It'll mess you maybe break you
But it'll leave you stronger in the end
And I guess it all depends
'Cause it's a lie, it's a crime, and it's just something that I can't deny
You know it looks so good from the outside
It's a mistake that I'm willing to make
And a promise that I just might break but
Gotta find out how much my heart can take
Now I'm beggin' ya pleaseâ€¦
