<song artist="Tristan_Prettyman" title="A_Little_Bit">
These days 'round three o'clock
Rain does start to fall
Downpour on the whole damn block
So loud on the brick walls
Don't go making this easy
Don't go making it hard
'Cause when you come around
Eyes so blue
You know I can't ignore, no I can't ignore
You got something I want
Just a little bit
You got something I need
Just a little bit
No matter how hard I try to fight it
You're gonna bring this girl to her knees
'Cause everybody got places to go
And people to see
Everybody got plenty of time
But they don't know how to set it free
So why don't you come back
Come back to me
Baby come on back
Come back to me
You got something I want
Just a little bit
You got something I need
Just a little bit
No matter how hard I try to fight it
You're gonna bring this girl to her knees
Yes, you're gonna bring this girl to her knees
Bringing it up, bring it down to my knees
