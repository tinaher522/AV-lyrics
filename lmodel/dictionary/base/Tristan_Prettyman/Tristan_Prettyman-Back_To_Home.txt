<song artist="Tristan_Prettyman" title="Back_To_Home">
Holding my breath and I'm making a wish
You brace yourself for the moment
When its all gonna flip
We couldn't stop if we tried, ah I
Stuck in a space but its all gonna change
So there's no reason to be scared of turning the page
We couldn't stall if you tried, ah I
Sundown, sunrise
We won't be lost in the dark
Between our head and our heart
All of these roads lead us back
Back to home
La la la la's
La la la la's
La la la la's
La la la la's
Get what you give, and ya give what you get
The hardest part is letting go
So just do your best
There's no need to wonder why
Out of your head and into your heart
Strick a match and watch it burn
Make a new start
We are the architects of light
We won't be lost in the dark
Between our head and our hearts
All of these roads lead us back
Back to home
These aren't the walls that hold us in
Sometimes its just easier to forgive
All of these roads, lead us back, back to home
La la la la's
La la la la's
La la la la's
La la la la's
We won't be lost in the dark
Between our head and our hearts
All of these roads lead us back
Back to home
These aren't the walls that hold us in
Sometimes its just easier to forgive
All of these roads, lead us back, back to home
All of these roads, lead us back, back to home
