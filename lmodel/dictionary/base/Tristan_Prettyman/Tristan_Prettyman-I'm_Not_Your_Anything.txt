<song artist="Tristan_Prettyman" title="I'm_Not_Your_Anything">
I'm not your anything 
baby I never was 
something for fun 
something just because 
I'm not your anything and baby I never was 
open me up 
read me like a book 
I'll give you back 
everything you took 
every breath 
every single look 
and I'm just scared you'll find something 
a little better than nothing 
I'm scared that you'll find the best 
settle for less 
if I'm a wick 
your a flame 
light me on fire 
to see just why you came 
blow me out 
when you realize who's to blame 
and I'm just scared you'll find something 
a little better than nothing 
I'm scared that you'll find the best 
settle for less
