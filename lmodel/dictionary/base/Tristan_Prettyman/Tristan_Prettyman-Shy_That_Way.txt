<song artist="Tristan_Prettyman" title="Shy_That_Way">
You know you're stunning
You're absolutely stunning
And I'm running always running
And now I'm crying
It's only cause I'm caring
And if you were more daring
Maybe you'd stop staring
And come over and talk to me
Tell me bout how you've been waiting so patiently
And how you tried but I just turned away
And I'll say yeah well you know,
I'm shy that way
Shy that way
Maybe I'm shy that way
Oh, you know you're stunning
You're absolutely stunning
But you're always runnin'
But I'll catch up to you
The way you keep your distance is
Keeping my interest
So I'll keep it persistent
Oh, maybe someday
Someway, somehow in some town
We'll get together and
We'll break it down
And I'll ask why you've been
so shy, gotta be that way
Maybe baby, oh love, I like it that way
Shy that way
You know I love you so shy,
Shy that way
So keep it comin' comin' comin' comin'
Shy that way
There's always too much talking
And I wanna just keep walking
But I keep staring baby
Keep staring
Though I may not know the right things to say
I'll get it out to you one day
I'm shy that way
You're shy that way
Do you like it
Do you like it?
When I'm shy this way?
Yes I like it
Yes I like it
When you're shy
Shy that way
I like it
I like it shy
You know it's alright, it's okay
'Cause we're
Shy that wayâ€¦
