<song artist="Tristan_Prettyman" title="The_Rebound">
I saw you at the produce stand
By the tangerines, bananas in your hand
We talk for five, yeah maybe more
You don't got a girlfriend anymore
And you're pretty hot so I'm around
For the rebound
For the rebound...
I gotta knock it off, gotta go to bed
You and your banana stuck in my head
But then you called and boy, I came
That's what she said for ten days straight
Take off your pants right now
For the rebound...
I called your number, can I have yours?
And I'm not positive but I'm pretty sure
That your shirt would look better on my floor...
Tell me your name one more time
While I check you out at the checkout line
(???) and now he knows 
The magic happens at Trader Joe's
So hit me up 'cause I'm always down
For the rebound
For the rebound
For the rebound
For the rebound...
