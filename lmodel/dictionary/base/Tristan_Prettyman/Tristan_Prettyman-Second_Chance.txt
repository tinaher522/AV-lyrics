<song artist="Tristan_Prettyman" title="Second_Chance">
I've thrown away the postcards
And all the pictures I had kept
I didn't even burn them
I didn't think you deserve that much respect
How does it feel to be cut off?
I lock the door and throw away the key
Letting go has never felt so easy
The best thing that never happened to me
Don't go to tell me you're not trying
When you try to get me back
I'm not so sure you even knew
What you had
How many times will you get it wrong
Before you get it right, oh right, oh right
You have my love in your hands
But I'm taking it back
Because it's not what I need
And you already got your second chance
And you already got your second chance
I'm not looking for reaction
I'm not up for any more requests
You've lost my interest
I'm sure you probably good have guessed
Did you think that we could be friends
You better learn how to be a good friend first
The only way for you to hold me
Always seemed to be behind closed doors
Don't go to tell me you're not trying
When you try to get me back
I'm not so sure you even knew
What you had
How many times will you get it wrong
Before you get it right, oh right, oh right
You have my love in your hands
But I'm taking it back
Because it's not what I need
And you already got your second chance
And you already got your second chance
I don't feel anything, anymore
I don't feel anything, anymore
I don't feel anything, anymore
Anymore, anymore, anymore
Anymore, anymore, anymore
How many times will you get it wrong
Before you get it right, oh right, oh right
You have my love in your hands
But I'm taking it back
Because it's not what I need
And you already got your second chance
And you already got your second chance
How many times will you get it wrong
Before you get it right, oh right, oh right
You have my love in your hands
But I'm taking it back
Because it's not what I need
And you already got your second chance
And you already got your second chance
