<song artist="Tristan_Prettyman" title="When_You_Come_Down">
If you're scared, let it go
And if you ever have a doubt
Now you know
That your heart, it won't break
And it was never good
At making mistakes
So it's no wonder my love
Goes on and on
You were always easy for me
I just the right noon, all along
Even when I know you're feeling like flying away
Believe me when I tell you that my love hasn't changed
And the moment don't forget
Tomorrow it will all turn around
I'll be waiting when you come down
Waiting when you come down
Here we go, once again
Tying to break it when it tries to bend
Got your head, in the clouds
And though you feel so far away from me now
But still my love, my love
Goes on and on
But I don't know if my love will ever be enough
Even when I know you're feeling like flying away
Believe me when I tell you that my love hasn't changed
And the moment don't forget
Tomorrow it will all turn around
I'll be waiting when you come down
Waiting when you come down
How can I get you where you wanna go
When you don't know where you wanna go
Push me away then you pull me close
And I hold on, and you let go
Even when I know you're feeling like flying away
Believe me when I tell you that my love hasn't changed
And the moment don't forget
And the moment don't forget
I'll be waiting when you come down
Even when I know you're feeling like flying away
Believe me when I tell you that my love hasn't changed
And the moment don't forget
Tomorrow it will all turn around
I'll be waiting when you come down
Waiting when you come down
Tomorrow it will all turn around
