<song artist="Tristan_Prettyman" title="Breathe">
It's a confirmation for your imagination
This type of situation goes on and on
What to do, how to see
When every little thing seems to get in my way
Well I can't breathe
And I wish that you couldn't take your eyes off me
But it's never easy as it seems, is it?
Please, softly before I scream
Breathe, breathe, breathe
Say you adore me
What good could you be for me
And after I'm gone, wondering where you went wrong
'Cause you're only taking inches when I'm giving you miles
Did you figure that maybe I wasn't worth your while?
Well I can't breathe
And I wish that you couldn't take your eyes off me
But it's never easy as it seems, is it?
Please, softly before I scream
Breathe, breathe, breathe
'Cause where you got me is where you want me
Where you had me but you left me
And let this go on for so long
Got me where you want me
Where you had me but you left me
And let this go on for so long
And I can't breathe
And I wish that you couldn't take your eyes off me
But it's never easy as it seems, is it?
Please, softly before I scream
Breathe, breathe, breathe
