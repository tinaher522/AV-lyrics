<song artist="Tristan_Prettyman" title="Hypocrite">
Surrounded by such morons 
they stand on their heads to please one another 
bow down, in each others presence 
only to turn around for more lies 
Hate the moon, but you say you love the stars 
and you ride around in your fancy cars 
what a hypocrite you are 
well these contradictions have gone way to far 
I can hear you but I, cant make out the words 
and are you for real or are you pretend? 
cause you always say one thing, and do another 
and for what? what are you trying to cover? 
hate the moon, but you say you love the stars 
you'll ride around in your parents fancy cars 
what a hypocrite you are 
these contradictions have gone way to far
