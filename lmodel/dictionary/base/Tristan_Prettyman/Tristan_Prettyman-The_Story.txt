<song artist="Tristan_Prettyman" title="The_Story">
I'm the icing on the cake
I'm the secret ingredient you're missing
I'm the sidewalk but I'm not complete
And I'm the reason that baby, you're trippin'
Ohh decisions you didn't make
I'm the chance you chose, not to take
And I'm the one you wish you were kissing
Pray for clear skies tonight
You better start wishin'
So you write the title
And I'll write the chapters
We can read a story
Of a love gone disaster
You write the moral
And I'll write the lesson
And we can read of love
That kept us, guessing
Cause I am in question
You are in reason
Soon this will change
Just like the seasons
My leaves will fall
While you'll turn to cold
And the colors on the ground
Are so bright and so bold
And I'll make no motion
You'll hold me tightly
I'll look at you
As you let me down lightly
The story always ends up like this
Another opportunity
That you're going to miss
So you write the title
And I'll write the chapters
We can read a story of a love gone disaster
You write the moral
And I'll write the lesson
And we can read a love that kept us guessing
But I know you so well
Ohh when are you gonna come around
Ohh but I know you soo well
When are you gonna come around
Ohh ohh ohh
Ohh ohh ohh
Ohh ohh ohh
You want it to be like this
Ohh ohh ohh
I see how it is
Another opportunity that you're
Gonna miss
