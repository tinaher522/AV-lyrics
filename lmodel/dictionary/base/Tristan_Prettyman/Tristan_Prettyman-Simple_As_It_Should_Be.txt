<song artist="Tristan_Prettyman" title="Simple_As_It_Should_Be">
Put your hands to my hands
Put your knees to my knees
Put your eyes to my eyes
Come on baby complement me
'Cause I don't think that we
Should ever feel the need to worry
Ever get ourselves in a hurry
You know I love you
I know you love me
So time will go
And we may be
Far apart I know
But as far as I can see
This is so good
There's no need for change
It's alright with me
It's as simple as it should be
Simple as it should be
And this love will build
Through flights and streets
In the end I predict
You'll get the very best of me
So put your lips to my lips
Why not go on and take all of it
And just run as fast as you can
Just 'cause you can
'Cause time will go
And we may be
Far apart I know
But as far as I can see
This is so good
There's no need for change
It's alright with me
It's as simple as it should be
Simple as it should be
I am almost 23
Confused with all the lines in between
They are dying to be read
Softly spoken simply said
Tell me do you believe
In the girl that is me
With her feet to your feet
Well that's all that I need
'Cause time will go
And we may be
Far apart I know
But as far as I can see
This is so good
There's no need for change
It's alright with me
It's as simple as it should be
Simple as it should be
