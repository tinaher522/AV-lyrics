<song artist="Tristan_Prettyman" title="Maybe_I'm_The_One">
I would return your calls 
but you don't call me anymore 
I could call to say hello 
but I deleted your number, long time ago 
we never talked about anything much 
just the usual such and such 
we never talked about "you and I" 
or why the stars hang low in the sky 
well I might have been the one 
to give your money a little run 
but you ran as fast as you came 
and maybe I'm the one to blame 
when I see you out at night 
I will not look your way 
didn't I play it off so well 
you looked, but my look, well it never came 
but you could have been the one 
make me come all undone 
but you ran as fast as you came 
maybe I'm the one to blame 
maybe I would have done the same...
