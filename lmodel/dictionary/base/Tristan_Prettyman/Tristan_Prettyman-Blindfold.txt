<song artist="Tristan_Prettyman" title="Blindfold">
Don't I seem better
Don't I seem just fine
I've been writing you love letters one at a time
Keep my thoughts in order
Put my love on the line
But you came a long and took it all down
And put your laundry up to dry
No matter how hard I try
Don't think you'll ever see
You're love is a perfect blindfold for me
You swim in and out of my heart
Like a fish in a bowl
Getting warm with summer approaching
But still my feet are cold
No matter how hard I try
Don't think you'll ever see
That you're love is a perfect blindfold for me
alone is good for me
alone is where id rather be
I can always use the company
No one else will do, baby I still want you
Yeah I still want you
and no one else will do
So please push me away
It's the least you can do
My eyes are sore, my feet are tired
I'm sick of chasing you
No matter how hard I try
Don't think you'll ever see
That you're love is a perfect blindfold for me
No matter how hard I try
Don't think you'll ever see
That you're love is a perfect blindfold for me
