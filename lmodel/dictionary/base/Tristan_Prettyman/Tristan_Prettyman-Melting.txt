<song artist="Tristan_Prettyman" title="Melting">
I will sing you a song, I will save you a dance 
If you just give me a chance 
A little piece of your mind, little bit of your time 
To let it unwind 
See... 
What is it I don't get, something I'll never forget 
Something good that hasn't even started yet 
It's so good that it's bad 
It might be the best damn thing that I ever had... 
Happen to me, well you see 
I'm still melting 
Over you, I'm still holding on 
And baby well, 
I'm still melting 
'Cause I fell hard, but not hard enough...
You didn't even notice 
I took that risk and I jumped ship 
And now I'm waving my arms drowning in the ocean 
While you go on saying everything I've been trying to say 
And now I'd be foolish to let you get away 
So stay with me awhile... 
'Cause I'm still melting 
Over you, 
Ohh well I'm still holding on 
To all your words 
And I'm still feeling love, love, love, 
I'm still melting 
So let's get out of here 
Feel like chasing my fears 
You never said too much, I shoulda took it as a clue 
That it would only be a matter of time, 'til I was falling all over you 
'Cause I'm still melting 
Over you, I'm still holding on 
I'm still dreaming, so don't wake me yet 
'Cause I, I don't want to forget 
How you picked me back up 
And you lay my head down 
And now I feel you heavy, over me 
And now I'm in to deep now 
Well... 
I'm still melting.... 
Over you.... 
Yeah I'm still holding on... 
Baby, I'm still dreaming, so don't wake me yet, 'cause I... 
I don't want to forget...
