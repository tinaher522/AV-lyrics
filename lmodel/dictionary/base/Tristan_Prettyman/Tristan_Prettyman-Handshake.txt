<song artist="Tristan_Prettyman" title="Handshake">
Hey boy, where you leaving to?
Always leaving all the time
Wanna get caught up to you
Gonna figure out how to make you mine
Know I love it when we're together
Don't it always feel so right?
Love to fall asleep when you hold me
Wake up and make love in the morning time
Hey boy, how come you feel this way?
For a little longer I'll try to make you stay
Don't want to break their hearts but if you don't they'll break you down
You'll wanna fall apart
Girls go wild for your east coast style
Happened more than once in a while
Think I know just where you're coming from
Up against the wall with my clothes coming undone
Sayin' love is a funny thing
When you've taken more than you can bring
Sayin' love is a funny thing
When you're caught up in the moment
'Cause boy I got your love right here
Don't blow it
No baby don't you blow it
'Cause I'm picking up the pieces that you left behind
It ain't so easy when you've flooded my mind
I try to stay steady but I loose my grip
You've got the kinda love that ain't easy to quit
Never hesitate to be taking it slow
You've got the moves to be puttin' on one hell of a show
When you stop by you never let me know,
By the end you've got me begging, baby please don't go
Sayin' love is a funny thing
When you've taken more than you can bring
Sayin' love is a funny thing
When you're caught up in the moment
So boy got your love right here
Son't blow it
No baby don't you blow it
Wanna offer up a little proposition
For when you can't be with the one you love kissing
In your heart there's a reason that you need it
This kind of love is a handshake agreement
Start it slow see where it goes
Most of the time you you never really know
Love can take you to some beautiful places
Lighten up the lives of a hundred thousand faces
Lighting up the lives on some faces
Sayin' love is a funny thing
When you've taken more than you can bring
Sayin' love is a funny thing
Don't get caught up in the moment
So boy got your love right here
Don't blow it
No baby don't you blow it
