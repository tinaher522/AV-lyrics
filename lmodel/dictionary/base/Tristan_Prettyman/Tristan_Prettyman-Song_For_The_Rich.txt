Get off work about 4 o'clock 
And I'm late again 
'Cause you'll be here by 6:30 
And we'll go looking for a close parking spot again 
Sitting in a room full of believers 
Now you tell me what's wrong and what's right 
'Cause I look over at you baby, 
You got your good intentions focused so tight 
And now it hurts me so, to have to see you go 
To watch these drugs pull you down 
When there's nothing we can do and no one to get through 
Watch you fall in and out of this mess 
What's wrong with a little bit of experimentation to 
Open the eyes of the new generation well... 
Build your world on a cocaine foundation and 
Watch it all blow away... 
And now it hurts me so, to have to see you go 
To watch these drugs pull you down 
When there's nothing we can do and no one can get through 
Watch you fall deeper into this mess 
Well I haven't see you in awhile 
You know I, I miss our talks I miss your smile 
'Cause the look of innocence is priceless 
But right now you look so lifeless 
And now it hurts me so, to have to see you go 
To watch this song break you down 
And when you feel you can't get through and there's no hope left in you 
You know I'll be right here to help you find your way out... 
And now it hurts me so to have to see you go,
To watch these drugs pull you down....
