<song artist="Tristan_Prettyman" title="You_Got_Me">
Tell me you love me
That I don't know how much you mean it
Every time you look in my eyes
You make sure that I can see it
I can't recall if I ever felt this way before
And if I did, wouldn't want those feelings hanging
Around here anymore
Just so you know
You got me
Nothing in the whole wide world could ever
Stop me
If you got love, got love to give
Just keep giving it up and someone will
Let you in
And just, so you know
You got me
Everyday you write it down
Just so I can read it
The best thing that ever happened to you
You know I wanna be it
I can't recall if I ever had a love I truly missed
And if I did, it wasn't no love compared to this
Just so you know
You got me
Nothing in the whole wide world could ever
Stop me
If you got love, got love to give
Just keep giving it up and someone will
Let you in
And just, so you know
You got me waiting
Learning my patience
Won't you hurry up and rescue me
There's so much talking
It's all I wanted
Just so you know
You got me
Nothing in the whole wide world could ever
Stop me
'Cause if you got love, got love to give
Oh, just giving it up and someone will let you in
And just so you know
You got me
Nothing in the whole world could ever stop me
'Cause if you got love
Love, love to give
Oh just keep giving it up
And giving it up
And giving it up
And just so you know
You got me
