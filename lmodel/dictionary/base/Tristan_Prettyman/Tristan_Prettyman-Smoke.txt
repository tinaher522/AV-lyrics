<song artist="Tristan_Prettyman" title="Smoke">
If I could I would be smoke
And I'd float myself out of here
And I'd go wherever you are
And I'd never have to be too far from here
And I'd linger in your fingers
A transparent shade of gray
And watch as you watch me
Slowly fade away
Into the night
Where are you when I need you by my side
Shouldn't it be that easy
To just be happy for awhile
Get lost in a moment
Wasting time trading smiles
Shouldn't it be that easy
To just be happy for awhile
Come on won't you waste my time
Baby waste my time
Won't you waste all my time
Things are never what they seem
Lately you're all I dream
Well I'm running but I'm not getting anywhere and
Do you even care?
Shouldn't it be that easy
To just be happy for awhile
Get lost in a moment
Wasting time trading smiles
Shouldn't it be that easy
To just be happy for awhile
Come on won't you waste my time
baby waste my time
Won't you waste all my time
C'mon and waste all my time
I'm just trying to find my way
Between the glitter and the gray
Baby I just want some time with you
And ohh I swear this time I'll make it through well well
Shouldn't it be that easy
To just be happy for awhile
Get lost in a moment
Wasting time trading smiles
Shouldn't it be that easy
To just be happy for awhile
Come on won't you waste my time
baby waste my time
Won't you waste all my time
C'mon and waste all my time
