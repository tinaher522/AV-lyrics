<song artist="Tristan_Prettyman" title="Interview_With_Who">
Am I sick of giving the same answers?
Are you sick of asking the same questions?
If we go round and round repeating
We got no direction on this
System falling apart
I can't believe it all started
At the heart of the matter of fact
I'd put it all in but I won't get it back
And my love, my love
The only thing that is stable
When my time is all tied up, up
But my heart is able
So come on
'Cause I won't let you down
And when I come around
Well, I'll be good as new
So don't give up on me so soon
These interviews with who
Can't tell the rumors from the truth
Don't let it get the best of you
Don't give up on me so soon
Did the travel ever catch you in a hurry?
I can't believe that I even began to worry
In the big picture, we're all so small
We get so caught up, forgetting that we fall
Everything about it takes time to grow
So just learn to be loose, and let it all go
'Cause the time goes by, so damn fast
We try to build it all up but is it ever gonna last?
And my love, my love
The only thing that is stable
When my time is all tied up, up
But my heart is able
So come on now
'Cause I won't let you down
And when I come around
Well, I'll be good as new
So don't give up on me so soon
These interviews with who
Can't tell the rumors from the truth
Don't let it get the best of you
And don't give up on me so soon
Don't give up on me now
'Cause I can show you how
I won't let you down
And when I come around
Well, I'll be good as new
So don't give up on me so soon
These interviews with who
Can't tell the rumors from the truth
They'll try to get the best of you
So don't give up on me so soon
Yeah, don't give up on me so soon, yeah
Don't give up on me so soon
Don't give up on me so soon
