<song artist="Tristan_Prettyman" title="Spain">
sometimes I cry, I don't know why 
cause this world is changing, leaving me behind 
but I cant complain, this life I live 
is more than I have to offer, more than I have to give 
but inside I'm screaming, but they cant hear me now 
If you can reach me, I need you now more than I ever did 
And so I sit, and stare at the sky 
and if you're here, please tell me why 
this oceans big, so far and wide 
and everyday I watch the sun fade from my eyes 
And now I'm praying, so God if you can hear me help me out 
shed some light on my life, cause I need it now more than I ever did 
if you saw me now, you'd say don't cry 
baby girl wipe those tears from your eyes 
cause now your doing, everything they said you couldn't do 
and now you realize you don't need them as much as you thought you did 
and now they're screaming, and you can hear them loud and clear 
and now they need you, just like you needed them
