<song artist="Tristan_Prettyman" title="Daisy">
I went on a walk inside your head, the other day 
I couldn't believe some of the things, I heard you say cause 
I've seen the way, that you've been looking at me 
and its dangerous, and very intentionally 
well we can spend the afternoon, locked in your room 
don't act so surprised, I know what you wanna do 
turn off my phone, cause I don't wanna hear it ring 
I know my girls be calling up, consistently 
saying.. 
ohh, here we go again 
you know we thought she learned her lesson 
ohh but I guess I didn't and 
it'd be foolish to pretend to say that, I never loved you, and ill never ever love you again 
So I was walking down the road, the other day 
I was doing just fine, daydreaming my life away 
and then, little daisy caught my eye, and said 
"ill tell you if he loves you or not" and to my surprise 
well I think that daisy lied, cause 
I seen the way, that you've been looking in my eyes, 
its ohh so nice, you got me in a daze and now, how could I complain 
ohh, no here we go again, you know I 
thought I learned my lesson, 
but you know I never do 
and it'd be stupid to believe that 
I never loved you and that I'll never love you again 
again, ill never love you 
again, ill be thinking of you again 
and again, and again, and again
