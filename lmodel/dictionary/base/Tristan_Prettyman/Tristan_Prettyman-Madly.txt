<song artist="Tristan_Prettyman" title="Madly">
I'm not surprised that you still call
I'm not surprised
I'm more surprised that i don't answer
Pick up the phone to call you back
Pick up the phone to call you back
Ain't it funny how things work out like that
'Cause the time that it takes to open my eyes
Is the time that it took me to realize
Madly, madly, madly
Well tell me that you need me
Show me I'm the only and that's all I need to know.
Madly, madly, madly
Well if you really love me,
When you see me leavin' baby, just let me go
Well I've been good, no I've been great
You say you're in a better place
And honestly, I'm happy for you
But there's a tone in my voice that gives away my selfish choice
Can my heart beat any faster?
'Cause the time that it takes to pass me by
Is the time that it took me to realize
Madly, madly, madly
Well tell me that you need me
Show me I'm the only and that's all I need to know
Madly. madly, madly
Well if you really love me
When you see me leavin' baby, just let me go
We give it up, try to find
What was with us all the time
Gotta lose some things, if you're ever gonna get on by
And who was wrong, who was right
Always end up in a fight
I thought I'd crumble, but now I find...
Madly, madly, madly
If you really love me
When you see me leavin' just let me go
Madly, madly, madly
Well tell me that you need me
Show me I'm the only and that's all I need to
Know, know, know, know
Madly, madly, madly
Well if you really love me
When you see me leavin' baby just let it go, no
Madly, madly, madly
Well tell me that you want me
When you see me leavin' baby
Just let me go
