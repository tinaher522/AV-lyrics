<song artist="Tristan_Prettyman" title="Open_Up_Your_Eyes">
All around me
Everything is living
Beauty full of light
Just the beginning
Stars in the sky
Perfectly positioned
Over deep blue seas
Lets go swimming
Open up your eyes
Open up your eyes
And let the light light come in
Open up your mind
All you gotta do is listen
The time is now
And that'll be our mission
Cause we can be the change
We can teach the children
All about the mother
And the love she's giving
Just open up your eyes
Open up your eyes
And let the light light come in
I know that if I believe
Oh I can do almost anything
Oh well that first step
Is the hardest
But how else are we gonna start this
How we gonna start this
Tell me baby, ohâ€¦
Whats it gonna be
If you wanna be the difference
Easy to see
Sky has no limits
Committing to the choice
Miles make the distance
That your love will go
When you put your heart in it
Just open up your eyes
Open up your eyes
And let the light light come in
Open up your eyes
And let the light light come and open up your eyes
And let the light light come in
Open up your eyes
And let the light light come in
Open up your eyes
And let the light light come
