<song artist="Tristan_Prettyman" title="Get_Away">
Wait for you 
I would forever 
Turn my back on you? 
I would never 
however long it may take 
that's how long I will wait 
for you... 
Maybe you just need some time alone 
take a trip and go back home 
think about the things that you've done 
you know you don't have to please everyone 
around you... 
These days its hard to find some time to get away 
just enough to realize that everything's gonna be ok 
take a break from it all 
learn how to take a fall 
You should know that you've made quite an impression on me 
and there's no place that I would rather be than 
stuck with you somewhere, anywhere 
and just because people talk, that doesn't mean you have to care 
These days it seems harder and harder to get away 
ease my mind, clear my throat, soon enough for you to hear me say 
that I want you to know 
that I'm never gonna let you go 
when things aren't fun that's when you know you've got a problem 
but every problem was made for problem solving 
but you were never problem for me 
except when I let you go cause I was too blind to see, the answer, right in front of me 
these days its so hard to find the time to get away 
take a deep breath and a step back 
enough to see that 
everything's working out fine 
its only a matter of time
