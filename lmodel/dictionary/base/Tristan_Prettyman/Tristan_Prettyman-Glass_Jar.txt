<song artist="Tristan_Prettyman" title="Glass_Jar">
You handed me a glass jar
And took my hand
We were sittin' on the stairs
Starin' at the sand
You asked me once
and I said yes
You said I never have to worry 'bout anything ever again
*And now everything's as if nothing ever happened
the version of your story isn't really matchin' up
You gave up on us
You got the whole world watchin' and everyone's
attention, you turn your head and you never even
mention us
You gave up on love
I'm starin' at this ring
An infinite circle
Thought nothin' could break the foundation we built on
And just like that
the wind shifts it's way
How could somethin' so sacred ever come to be replaced
* And now everything's as if nothing ever happened
The version of your story isn't really matchin' up
You gave up on us
You've got the whole world watchin' and everyone's Attention, You turn your head and you never even
mention us
You gave up on love
(Instrumental)
I found a little glass jar
on a shelf
It reminded me to take a good hard look at myself
Reminded me of, some better days
When I knew you in version that i wished you woulda' stayed in,
but everything's as if nothin' ever happened the version of your story isn't really matchin' up
You gave up on us
You've got the whole world watchin', everyone's attention
You turn your head and you never even mention us
You gave up on love
yeah, you gave up on us
