<song artist="Tristan_Prettyman" title="Casualty">
We met out of luck and it was so far from the truth
We talked and we laughed and there was nothing we couldn't do
So high on a cloud never woulda ever thought to look down
You'd think I'd know better nowâ€¦
Live to learn &amp; learn to love
I wanna know about it all
I would run &amp; take the jump
Cause I'd be happy just to fall
For you - nothing I wouldn't do
For you - nothing I couldn't prove
In a split second maybe just for a minute
I would let you get the best of me
In a split second maybe just for a minute
I would be your casualty
When its good, so good and it won't compare to anything
YCause You read me like a book and for once I didn't run away
It's all I've been waiting for
I've never been so sure
For you - nothing I wouldn't do
For you - nothing I couldn't prove
In a split second maybe just for a minute
I would let you get the best of me
In a split second maybe just for a minute
I would be your casualty
You give me a reason, something I could believe in
And now I can see that its all because of you, because of you
For you - nothing I wouldn't do
For you - nothing I couldn't prove
In a split second maybe just for a minute
I would let you get the best of me
In a split second maybe just for a minute
I would be your casualty
