<song artist="Tristan_Prettyman" title="War_Outta_Peace">
Well, there are times when you know
When you should stay, when you should go but you don't
Rehearse the lines in your head
You know what needs to be said
But it all comes out bad
And if it's space that you need
If time is falling at your feet
Walking away empty
Love is a crazy dream
Is it what you want?
Is it what you need?
We go back and forth
Making war out of peace
And you won't let go
And I won't give up
We go round and round
But is it ever enough?
Is it ever enough?
Lately I'm falling away
Growing more quiet by the day
Not really sure why even feel this way
I guess I got a little scared
Someone could actually care
This time just might be something there
And if it's change that you need
A little more mystery
Some kind of deeper meaning
Love is a crazy dream
Is it what you want?
Is it what you need?
We go back and forth
Making war out of peace
And you won't let go
And I won't give up
We go round and round
But is it ever enough?
Is it ever enough?
I'm sure I'll mess it all up
I'm sure I'll try to convince myself
That I just need time to be
But what I want to be is
Something else, yeah someone else
So why did we cross the line
Mess it all up with the time
And in the end just assume it'll be alright?
Is it what you want?
Is it what you need?
We go back and forth
Making war out of peace
And you won't let go
And I won't give up
We go round and round
But is it ever enough?
Is it what you want?
Is it what you need?
We go back and forth
Making war out of peace
And you won't let go
And I won't give up
No I won't give up
No I won't give up
Won't give up
No I won't give up
