<song artist="The_Black_Eyed_Peas" title="Magic">
We're comin' right away
You know what to do
Black Eyed Peas is the crew (is the crew)
You know what to do (what to do)
We're gonna make a move (make a move, move)
Oh yeah what you do (yeah)
Every little thing we do's like magic
Any thing we do will not go wrong
Every little thing we do's like magic
Everywhere we go we're rockin' on
Every little thing we do's like magic
Any thing we do will not go wrong
Every little thing we do's like magic
Everywhere we go we're rockin' on (rockin' on)
Y'all lookin' for a festival I know the spot
Come across the bridge over here to where it's hot
It's poetic, guaranteed you're diggin' it
You have the bobs a lot, bombience is infinite
Baby doll no need to front, we the exquisite
We could be your favorite, yeah you could come brassiere
What you aah-bout to witness ain't no kind of fear
It's immaculate, look at what we're comin' with
Yeah I tease you when I hit you with them tidbits
But you tease me when you be wearing them outfits
Every angle of it IS so perfect
I know you love it when we (do it)
Every little thing we do's like magic
Any thing we do will not go wrong
Every little thing we do's like magic
Everywhere we go we're rockin' on
It's another one of those exposure from my main culture
I'ma do this shit like I'm supposed ta
Apl. d. Ap. on the mic, let me set it right
Take you on a ride flight to the other side
One point to the other we providin' ya
You could cross the same bridge if ya wanted ta
Sometimes gotta take time to do
New things can be trapped outta move
DO what you want to do, who to tell you not to
You want to make jams go ahead I got you
Don't be afraid no matter who you are
No matter who you be, you're a star
Every little thing we do's like magic
Any thing we do will not go wrong
Every little thing we do's like magic
Everywhere we go we're rockin' on
Everywhere we go (rockin' on), everywhere we go (yeah)
Everywhere we go-oh (rock on), we go-oh-woh-woh-woh (Hold up!)
Hold up y'all and watch me elaborate!
I'ma try my best to what? To communicate
What I demonstrate will simply stimulate
The cha make you gyrate, pleasure when we penetrate
(Everywhere we go) We motivate, (everywhere we go) and we captivate
(We roll) Here, (we go) there, (we go) here, (we go)
Everywhere, every everywhere
Black Eyed Peas is like the hip hop Fred Astaire
Spread it out from over there to over here
Descendant of the all makin all of y'all aware that
We're fantastical when we're comin' with (magic)
And majestical when we're comin' with (magic)
Doin' it (once), we're doin it (twice), we're doin' it three times!
Every little thing we do's like magic
Any thing we do will not go wrong
Every little thing we do's like magic
Everywhere we go we're rockin' on 
Every little thing we do's like magic
Any thing we do will not go wrong
Every little thing we do's like magic
Everywhere we go we're rockin' on
Rockin' on, anything we do we rock rock on
We're just like, magic, we're magic, it's magic, it's magic
