Fergie
You know the music make me jump and prance
The BEPs we keep you rockin' on the dance
Give them the music, make them jump and prance
Dum diddley dum dum diddley dum dum diddley dum dum diddley diddley
You know the music make me jump and prance
The BEPs we keep you rockin' on the dance
Pass it, pass it, jump and prance
Dum diddley dum dum diddley dum dum diddley dum dum diddley diddley
will.i.am
Bring on the rhythm; bring on the drums
The RIM SHOT sound like someone gunned
(Blup! Blup!) There go your ear drum
So raise the volume to the maximum
Bass booming bout to make your body feel numb
Pulsation probably penetrate your skeleton
This little diddley definitely demonstrates some
Dum diddy dum â€“ so dance to the drums
Fergie
Don't hurt yourself, take it easy
There's no better time than right now
So let yourself go, o-eh-o
Watch yourself now, here comes the sound
You know the music make me jump and prance
The BEPs we keep you rockin' on the dance
Give them the music, make them jump and prance
Dum diddley dum dum diddley dum dum diddley dum dum diddley diddley
You know the music make me jump and prance
The BEPs we keep you rockin' on the dance
Pass it, pass it, jump and prance
Dum diddley dum dum diddley dum dum diddley dum dum diddley diddley
Dante
Freeze: music please
Apparently were the true MC's
B-Boys no decoys you know the sting
BEPs till infinity
And we officially are so fresh you see
So tell me if you see a crew that officially
Hit the whole globe simultaneously
Hit after hit, check out my melody
Fergie
Don't hurt yourself, take it easy
There's no better time than right now
So let yourself go, o-eh-o
Watch yourself now, here comes the sound
You know the music make me jump and prance
The BEPs we keep you rockin' on the dance
Give them the music, make them jump and prance
Dum diddley dum dum diddley dum dum diddley dum dum diddley diddley
You know the music make me jump and prance
The BEPs we keep you rockin' on the dance
Pass it, pass it, jump and prance
Dum diddley dum dum diddley dum dum diddley dum dum diddley diddley
apl.de.ap
Sim sim sim, blum blum blum
The Black Eyed Peas begun with action
Repeating rhy-rhythm in satisfaction
No need for asking, that's what's happening
The blip blip blip, the blah blah blah
If you didn't know me then then you'll never know me now
This the apl.de.ap, the Filipino Ap
If you need to know my style then let me show you how
Fergie
Don't hurt yourself, take it easy
There's no better time than right now
So let yourself go, o-eh-o
Watch yourself now, here comes the sound
You know the music make me jump and prance
The BEPs we keep you rockin' on the dance
Give them the music, make them jump and prance
Dum diddley dum dum diddley dum dum diddley dum dum diddley diddley
You know the music make me jump and prance
The BEPs we keep you rockin' on the dance
Pass it, pass it, jump and prance
Dum diddley dum dum diddley dum dum diddley dum dum diddley diddley
