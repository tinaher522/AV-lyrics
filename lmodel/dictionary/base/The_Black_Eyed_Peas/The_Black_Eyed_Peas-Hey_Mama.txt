A-La la la laa
Hey mama, this that shit that make you groove, mama
Get on the flow and move your booty mama
We the blast masters blastin' up the jamma
(Rewind)
Cutie cutie, make sure you move your booty
Shake that thing like we in the city of sin, and
Hey shawty, I know you want to party
the way your body lookin' make me really feel naughty
Cutie cutie, make sure you move your booty
Shake that thing like we in the city of sin, and
Hey shawty, I know you want to party
the way your body lookin' make me really feel naughty
will.i.am
I got a naughty naughty style and a naughty naughty crew
But everything I do, I do just for you
I'm a little bit of Old, and a bigger bit of New
The true niggas know that the peas come thru
We never cease, we never die no we never decease
We multiply like we mathamatice
And then we drop bombs like we in the middle east
The bomb bombas, the base move dramas
Naw y'all knaw, who we are
y'all knaw, we the stars
Steady rockin' on y'alls boulevards
And, lookin' hard without bodygaurds
I do what I can
Y'all come through 
Will.i.am
And still I stand, with still mic in hand
So come on mama, dance to the drama
Hey mama, this that shit that make you groove, mama
Get on the flow and move your booty mama
We the blast mastas blastin' up the jamma
So shake your bum bumma, come on now mama
This that shit that make you groove, mama
Get on the flow and move your booty mama
We the blast mastas blastin' up the jamma
A-La la la laa
We the big town stumpas, and and big sound pumpas
The beat bump bumpas all in your trunk trunkas
The girlies in the club got tha plump plump plumpas
And when I'm makin' love, my hip hump humps
It never quits we need to carry 9mm clips
Dont wanna squize trigger, just wanna squeeze tits
Lubaluba 'cause we the show stoppas
And the chief rockas, number one chief rockas
Naw y'all knaw, who we are
y'all knaw, we the stars
Steady rockin' on y'alls boulevards
How we rockin' it girl, without body guards
she be, Fergie, from the crew
B.E.P., come and take heed, as we take the lead
So come on papa, dance to the drama
Hey mama, this that shit that make you groove, mama
Get on the flow and move your body mama
We the blast mastas blastin' up the jamma
Cutie cutie, make sure you move your booty
Shake that thing like we in the city of sin, and
Hey shawty, I know you wanna party
the way your body look really make me feel nauuughty
Tippa
But the race is not, for the swift
But who really can, take control of it
And tippa irie and the black eyed peas will be thhhheeerre
til infiniti, til infiniti, til infiniti, til infiniti
Tippa is ouuuuuut
Nosa dima shock, nosa dima ting
everytime you sit there i hear, bling bling
O wata ting, hear blacka sing
grinding, and winding
and the madda be moving in a perfect timing
and we dance and dance to the end of the thing
and we're really to nice, it finga lickin
like rice and peas and chicken and bling
Hey mama, this that beat that make you groove, mama
Get on the flow and move your body mama
We the blast mastas blastin' up the jamma
So shake your bambama, come on now mama
This that shit that make you groove, mama
Get on the flow and move your body mama
We the blast mastas blastin' up the jamma
(Winding down)
La la la la la.
Cutie, cutie...
