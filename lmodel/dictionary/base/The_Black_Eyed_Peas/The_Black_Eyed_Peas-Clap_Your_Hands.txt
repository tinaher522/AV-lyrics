It's too much looky-looky-looky
Too much watchy-watchy-wah
They looky-looky-looky
&amp; they watchy-watchy-wah, uh-uh, uh-uh.
Tell me why all these ? bumaclutz? try to clown me
I tell 'em move away, me need some privacy
Don't you know I am the man that come up positivity
Never negativity 'cause we create then do-re-mi
My name is Will I Am from B.E.P.
Black Eyed Peas, numero uno, we be jammin' like marty
If I'm technical with my rhymes, let me know now
I shake it all around, niggas know how we be throwin' down
Too much looky, who be ditchin' y'all like hooky
Honey's wanna get up on me like suki-suki
They call me on my telley talkin' 'about mushi-mushi
They pullin' on my body, feelin' on my tushi-tushi.
It's too much looky-looky-looky
Too much watchy-watchy-wah
They looky-looky-looky
&amp; they watchy-watchy-wah, uh-uh, uh-uh.
&amp; don't you know, I need some privacy
Excuse me young girl, me need some privacy.
'cause the Black Eyed Peas is coming woofin' mighty-mighty flow
I'm deliverin the rhymes because my mama told me so
I'm a do what my mama say &amp; rock dollar y'all
Mama say, mama sah, mamu-makusta
Too much looky &amp; we the last cookie
Where pastry, dippin' like, umm umm, ? le criste?
Lickin' on your finger &amp; you lickin' your hand
That good, finish that man
Make sure sure... make sure.
Chorus:
Clap Your Hands now, people stomp your feet.
Clap Your Hands now, people clap your hands.
Clap Your Hands now, people stomp your feet.
Clap Your Hands now, people clap your hands.
Clap Your Hands now, people stomp your feet.
Clap Your Hands now, people clap your hands.
Clap Your Hands now, people stomp your feet.
Clap Your Hands now...
It's too much looky-looky-looky
Too much watchy-watchy-wah
They looky-looky-looky
&amp; they watchy-watchy-wah, uh-uh, uh-uh
&amp; you know, I need some privacy
Go play somewhere else, me need some privacy.
We open up, bottle killin', the business, showbiz
We be passin' the peas, purposely &amp; positive
Wonder if is, where does it last, say "Here it is"
Should be all up in your ear, with a test &amp; a quiz
See you dance, say "Damn, now what it is? "
Want to in sync with all the pea body kids
You be noddin' your head back ^ forth like this
They be feelin' my move, then your mind is in bliss.
So put your hands together now we ready to bounce
Got the whole world waiting for this, to be announced
Know you just got satisfaction by the ounce
You can either jump up &amp; boogie or just lounge.
It's too much looky-looky-looky
Too much watchy-watchy-wah
They looky-looky-looky
&amp; they watchy-watchy-wah, uh-uh, uh-uh.
I thought I said need some privacy
Go play somewhere else, me need some privacy.
Recite more poetic, a tactic from the attic
APL de ap, gets critical &amp; droppin' shit
Like a dimensional picture
You architect, so I free you to get the scripture
But when it hit ya, I got you turnin' like elixir
Back a glass of coniac, we divide the mixture
I'm about to fix you up, with a new texture
More information better down like a letter
&amp; in the sector.
Chorus:
Clap Your Hands y'all, come on, come on.
Just Clap Your Hands y'all, come on, come on.
Just Clap Your Hands y'all, come on, come on.
Just Clap Your Hands y'all, come on, come on.
It's too much looky-looky-looky
Too much watchy-watchy-wah
They looky-looky-looky
&amp; they watchy-watchy-wah, uh-uh, uh-uh
You know I need some privacy
Go play somewhere else, me need some privacy.
So put your hands together now we ready to bounce
Got the whole world waitin' for this, to be announced
Know you just got satisfaction by the ounce
You can either jump up &amp; boogie or just lounge.
It's too much looky-looky-looky
Too much watchy-watchy-wah
They looky-looky-looky
&amp; they watchy-watchy-wah, uh-uh, uh-uh
You gotta give me privacy.
Chorus:
It's too much looky-looky-looky
Too much watchy-watchy-wah
They looky-looky-looky
&amp; they watchy-watchy-wah, uh-uh, uh-uh
Clap Your Hands now, people stomp your feet
Clap Your Hands now, people clap your hands
Clap Your Hands now, people stomp your feet
Clap Your Hands now.
