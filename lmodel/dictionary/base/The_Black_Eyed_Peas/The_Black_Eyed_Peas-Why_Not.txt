<song artist="The_Black_Eyed_Peas" title="Why_Not">
You think your going nowhere when your walking down the street
acting like u just don't care when life could be so sweet
why you wana be like that as if there's nothing new
your not fooling no one you're not even fooling you
so walk a little slower and open up your eyes
some times its so hard to see the good things passing by
there may never be a sign no flashing neon light 
telling you to make your move or when the time is right so?
Why not? (why not) 
take a crazy chance?
Why not?
do a crazy dance?
if you lose a moment you might lose a lot so why not? (why not?)
why not take a crazy chance?
why not take a crazy chance?
You always dress in yellow when you wana dress in gold 
instead of listening to your heart you do just what your told
you keep waiting were you are 
what you'll never know
so lets just get into your car and go baby go!
so?.....
Why not? (why not)
take a crazy chance
Why not (why not)
do a crazy dance 
you might lose a moment you might ose a lot
so why notÂ ?
why not?
ooooooooooooohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh i could be the one for you
ooooooohhhhhhhh yea maybe yes maybe no
oooooohhhhhhhh it could be the thing to do
all i'm saying is you gotta let me knowowo
a a ya a a a ya ya ya 
a a ya ya a a yayaaaaaaa
you'll never get to heaven or even to L.A
if you don't beleive theres a wayyyyyyyyyyyyyy
why not? (take a star from the sky?)
why not? (spread your wings and fly?)
OH!!! 
it may take a little but it may take alot! 
but why not?
why not?
