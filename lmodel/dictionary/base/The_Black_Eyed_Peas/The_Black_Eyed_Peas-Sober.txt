Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh!
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh!
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh!
Oh-whoa-oh!
One Tri,
One Tri,
One tribe, one time, one planet, one race
Its all one blood, don't care about your face
The color of your eye
Or the tone of your skin
Don't care where you are
Don't care where you been
'Cause where we gonna go
Is where we wanna be
The place where the little language is unity
And the continent is called Pangaea
And the main ideas are connected like a sphere
No propaganda, they tried to upper hand us
'Cause man I'm loving this peace
Man, man, I'm loving this peace
Man, man, I'm loving this peace
I don't need no leader
That's gonna force feed a
Concept that make me think I need to
Fear my brother and fear my sister
And shoot my neighbor
With my big missile
If I had an enemy to (enemy)
If I had an enemy to (enemy)
If I had an enemy
Then my enemy is gonna try to come and kill me
'Cause I'm his enemy
There's one tribe y'all
One tribe y'all
One tribe y'all
One tribe y'all
We are one people
Let's catch amnesia, forget about all that evil
Forget about all that evil, that evil that they feed ya
Let's catch amnesia, forget about all that evil
That evil that they feed ya
Remember that we're one people
We are one people
One, one (one people)
One, one (one people)
One, one (one people)
One tribe, one tribe
One tribe, one time, one planet, one (race)
Race, one love, one people, one (and)
Too many things that's causing one (to)
Forget about the main cause
Connecting, uniting
But the evil is seen and alive in us
So our weapons are colliding
And our peace is sinking like Poseidon
But, we know that the one (one)
The evil one is threatened by the sum (sum)
So he'll come and try and separate the sum
But he dumb, he didn't know we had a way to overcome
Rejuvenated by the beating of the drum
Come together by the cycle of the hum
Freedom when all become one (one)
Forever
One tribe y'all
One tribe y'all
One tribe y'all
We are one people
Let's catch amnesia
Forget about all that evil (evil)
Forget about all that evil (evil)
That evil that they feed ya
Let's catch amnesia
Forget about all that evil (evil)
That evil, that they feed ya (feed ya)
Remember that we're one people
We are one people
One, one (one people)
One, one (one people)
One, one (one people)
One love, one blood, one people
One heart, one beat, we equal
Connected like the internet
United that's how we do
Lets break walls, so we see through
Let love and peace lead you
We could overcome the complication cause we need to
Help each other, make these changes
Brother, sister, rearrange this
The way I'm thinking that we can change this bad condition
Wait, use you mind and not your greed
Let's connect and then proceed
This is something I believe
We are one, we're all just people
One tribe y'all
One tribe y'all
One tribe y'all
We are one people
Let's catch amnesia
Forget about all that evil
Forget about all that evil, that evil that they feed ya
Let's catch amnesia
Let's catch amnesia, forget about all that evil
That evil, that they feed ya
We're one tribe y'all
We people, we people
One tribe y'all
One, one (one people)
One, one (one people)
One, one (one people)
One, one (one people)
One, one (one people)
One, one (one people)
Lets, lets catch amnesia
Lord help me out
Trying to figure out what its all about (what its all about)
'Cause we're one in the same (one in the same)
Same joy, same pain
And I hope that you're there when I need ya
'Cause maybe we need amnesia
And I don't wanna sound like a preacher
But we need to be one
One world, one love, one passion
One tribe, one understanding
'Cause you and me can become one.
