Rockin To The Beat
Rockin To The Beat
Rockin To The Beat
Rockin To The Beat
Rockin To The Beat
Rockin To The Beat
Rockin To The Beat (Rockin'...Rockin'...Rockin')
Rockin To The Beat
Rockin To The Beat
Rockin To The Beat
Rockin To The Beat
Rockin To The Beat
Comin' in with the disco jam
Stepped in the place and people like, "Damn."
Party get started with the Kool and the Fam
Body get naughty and do all that I can
What is a band that can't really rock?
What's a MC that's rockin' the spot?
What is a mic that ain't got no cable?
What's a DJ without the turntable?
What's a hot girl if she can't really dance?
What's Electro without wearing tight pants?
What is a rhythm if it just don't bump?
Baby, let me get in and give you just what you want
Give you what you need, baby, how you want it
Time to get nasty, put your ass on it
Time to get on it...on it...on it
Time to get on it
Rockin To The Beat
Rockin To The Beat
Rockin To The Beat
Rockin To The Beat
Rockin To The Beat
Rock - Beat
Rock - Beat
Rock - Beat
Rockin To The Beat
Rockin To The Beat
Rockin To The Beat
Rockin To The Beat
Rockin To The Beat
Rock - Beat
Rock -

Rockin To The Beat
Rockin To The Beat
Rockin To The Beat
Rockin To The Beat
Rockin To The Beat
Rockin To The Beat
Rockin To The Beat
Rockin To The Beat
Rockin To The Beat
