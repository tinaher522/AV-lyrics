<song artist="The_Black_Eyed_Peas" title="Labor_Day">
When I stepped in the room
I bring the heat like the month of June
Crank the volume make the bass go boom
Wild out like we some wild baboons
We go bananas to the tune
I wanna throw 'bows, give me elbow room
When I'm out my cacoon I'm ready to consume
It's hit the saloon 'cos
It's a holiday pardon me as I celebrate
And that's the way we do it
We get a little loopy off the ignorant fluid
And act a little stupid just in case you didn't knew it
And just how we do it, don't ask why we do it
That's just the way it be
Lovin' double D's, up at the A D
When I party in Hollywood, V I P
I don't understand that's T L E 'cos
We party forever and get down together
We don't stop, no, and we don't quit
Let's get it going 'cos you know we gon' celebrate
'Cause it's a holiday, I don't work today
Or the next three days, so let's celebrate
'Cos it's a holiday, I don't work today, nah
Pardon me as I celebrate
It's time to celebrate
Servin' up beatbox on a hotplate
Like that y'all, we on a festive date
Make you go ape then raise your heart rate
We gon' stay out late
Party till the morning and wake up late
We do it to the day break
Go on and on and then on and on and
Dance to my rhyme
I could holla, a cappella deaf till you're blind
You're mine, baby
Take it to the moon for your behind, baby
Take us to the moon and just recline, baby
Cock my gat and stroke my nine, baby
We don't stop, girl, we don't quit, no
We don't quit, no, we don't quit
We party forever and get down together
We don't stop, no, and we don't quit
Let's get it going 'cos you know we gon' celebrate
'Cause it's a holiday, I don't work today
Or the next three days, so let's celebrate
'Cos it's a holiday, I don't work today, nah
Pardon me as I celebrate
Don't stop it, just push it
Don't stop it, just push it
Move your body and push it
Get naughty and push it
We gon' party and push it
We gon' party and push it
Move your body and push it
Get naughty and push it, 'cos
It's a holiday
Pardon me as I celebrate
It's time to get wasted
And scope the whole place for girls with cute faces
'Cos I see some fly mamas so pack your pajamas
But don't bring the drama
But you could bring your melody
I'll plug in my mic and sing my harmonies
For how many times we gonna hit it
How many times we gonna split it
How many times you gonna get it
Or else you are gonna, wanna come over
You're gonna have to wanna, man
'Cos I'm the alligator champ
Driving the train, driving the tram
Or you could bring your friend and I switch my lane
And get buddy, buddy with your friend Mary Jane
She really blows my brain
She really blows my brain
We party forever and get down together
We don't stop, no, and we don't quit
Let's get it going 'cos you know we gon' celebrate
Said, we do it everyday, 'cos it's a holiday
And we do it every night, I don't work today
And we do it at the club
Yeah, uh, it's my birthday
So celebrate, 'cos it's a holiday I don't work today, nah
Pardon me as I celebrate
