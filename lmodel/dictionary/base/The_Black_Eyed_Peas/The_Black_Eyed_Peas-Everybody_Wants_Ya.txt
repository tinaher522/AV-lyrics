<song artist="The_Black_Eyed_Peas" title="Everybody_Wants_Ya">
I get this feeling as you walk away
A million hearts will break in two 
But they don't know the games that you can play
So they will always follow you
Every time you move, everybody grooves
I can't help thinkin its alright
You just gotta walk see the people talk
I like to watch you party
CHORUS
Cos everybody wants ya
when everybody sees ya
the world is full of dreamers
but I'm a great believer
And I'm no fool cos I got you
I see the way you act like you don't know
There's somthin 'bout your attitude
And it don't matter how far you go
Cos I'm the one that's goin home with you 
You just gotta bump, see the people jump
I can't help thinkin it's alright
When you do your thing everybody sings
They like to watch you party
Cos everybody wants ya
when everybody sees ya
the world is full of dreamers
but I'm a great believer
And I'm no fool cos I got you
I just wind you up and let you go
And I watch you in wonder
To see the look upon your face 
I'd say you already know
Chorus starts to fade......
