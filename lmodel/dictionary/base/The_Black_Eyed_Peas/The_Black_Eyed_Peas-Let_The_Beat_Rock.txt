<song artist="The_Black_Eyed_Peas" title="Let_The_Beat_Rock">
Let the beat rock, let the beat rock
Let the beat rock, let the beat rock
Let the beat rock, let the beat rock
Let the beat rock, let the beat rock
Let the beat rock, let the beat rock
Let the, I got that hit that beat that block
Keep that bass on the low
I got that ricky, ricky roll, that ricky, ricky roll
That digital spit, that visual shit
I got that boom, that boom, that, that, that
Fifty, my trunk it go boom, boom
My Ferrari, I zoom, zoom
Grown that paper smokin' doom, doom
Caught that strap strappin' goom, goom
Get that paper that's what I do
50 stacks when that's what I bloom
In the club makin' it rain
100 G's spent on my chain
Niggas can't shine the way I shine
Me, I grindin' poppin' on my nine
See I get the semi to bussin'
I get the mole and dunkin' 'em
Till I moan on fuckin' on me a soul or nothin'
I don't play no games, I simp-those-thangs
Hennesey patron goes smackdawn
Goes on and on till the early morn
Till the early morn it goes on and on
Yo, thought that's the way we, way we let the beat rock, boom
Though that's the way we, way we let the beat rock, boom
Though that's the way we, way we let the beat rock, pow
Let the beat rock
I like that boom, boom, pow, they jacking my style
They jackin' my style, style, my style
I'm so 3008, you so 2000 and late
I got that boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
That boom, boom, boom, lemme get it now
Yo, I'm way up high, call me your highness
I'm just so fly, call me you flyness
I be that G, call me the genius
I'm Black Eyed Peas, so baby please call me for peanuts
Call me cheerly, call me Willy, ladies call me poppa
I propel just like the fellas on 'em helicopters
Got you all intoxicated, stay on top for
Women I be swimmin' with them like my name is aqua
And I'm flowin' like I'm liquid
Pisces is my sign and I don't eat fish sticks
Though I feel lies, I be rockin' in big beats
D motherfuckin' D, only fuck with chicks wet
Come on honey, let ya D's rock
OG homies know me 'cause I make the beat knock
Black Eyed Peas and 50 got them chickens, wanna eat cock
I'll be scoopin' groupies, get them loopy when that beat rock
Yo, thought that's the way we, way we let the beat rock, boom
Though that's the way we, way we let the beat rock, boom
Though that's the way we, way we let the beat rock, pow
Let the beat rock
I like that boom, boom, pow, they jackin' my style
They jackin' my style, style, my style
I'm so 3008, you so 2000 and late
I got that boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
That boom, boom, boom, lemme get it now
Yo, let the beat rock, boom
Though that's the way we, way we let the beat rock, boom
Though that's the way we, way we let the beat rock, pow
Though that's the way we, way we let the beat rock
