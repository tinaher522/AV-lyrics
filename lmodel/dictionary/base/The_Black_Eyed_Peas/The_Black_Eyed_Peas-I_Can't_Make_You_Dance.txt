<song artist="The_Black_Eyed_Peas" title="I_Can't_Make_You_Dance">
I can’t make you dance
I can’t make you dance
I can’t make you dance
I can’t make you dance
I can’t make you dance
I can’t make you dance
I didn’t come here to stand around
I came to get down
Tell the DJ blast that sound
Vibrate the ground
Mother Fucker just turn it up
Loud as Fuck
Hit me with music, music
And I will dance
Make me dance
Standing in the B boy stands
Electro got me moving
Call up the ambulance
I can’t stop moving
I’m in a trance
Deon beonce standard phone
Make it fast
I can’t make you dance
Make you want me too,
I can’t make you dance
Make you want me too,
I can’t make you dance
Make you want me too,
Dance dance dance dance dance
How can I make you dance?
How can I make you dance?
How can I make you dance?
Make you dance, make you dance
How can I make you dance?
Oohhh, will you dance?
Come on Dj, go and drop it
Move that body to the sound
Everybody dance the topic
Get them feet above the ground
Jump up and down to the music
Getting through it, do it now
Aint got time to waste
This ain’t a place to stand around
Dance, come on people
Move your body to the beat
Dance, come on people
Rock your body, move your feet
Dance, come on people
Move your body to the beat
Dance, come on people
Rock your body, move your feet
I can’t make you dance
Make you want me too,
I can’t make you dance
Make you want me too,
I can’t make you dance
Make you want me too,
Dance dance dance dance dance
How can I make you dance?
How can I make you dance?
How can I make you dance?
Make you dance, make you dance
How can I make you dance?
Oohhh, will you dance?
I can’t make you dance
Make you want me too
I can’t make you dance
Dance, dance, dance, dance, dance…
Dance, dance, dance, dance, dance…
Dance, dance, dance, dance, dance…
Dance, dance, dance, dance, dance…
I can’t make you dance(x16)
Dance, dance, dance, dance, dance…
