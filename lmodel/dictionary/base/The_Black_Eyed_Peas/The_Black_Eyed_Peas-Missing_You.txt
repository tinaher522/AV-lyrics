Fergie
I can't stand another night
Stand another night
Without you
Since you've been away
Everything don't seem like they used to be
Between you and me
'Cause I'm missing your (ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
I'm missing your love (love-love-love)
I'm missing your (love-love-love)
I'm missing your love (love-love-love)
I'm missing your love (love-love-love)
I'm missing your love (love-love-love)
will.i.am
Yo. Yo. Yo.
Everyday-Everyday that you gone
I'm singing that sad song
If loving you is wrong
Then-Then I must be wrong
Even-Even when I'm gone (don't go away)
Our-Our love is strong (don't go away)
You the one I want (don't go away)
You're my nuh-You're my nuh-You're my number one
Yeah, our love ain't goin' out of fashion
I need your love, your passion
But love is everlasting, -lastin', (-lastin', -lastin')
(-Lastin', -lastin', -lastin')
Fergie
Since you've been away
Everything don't seem like they used to be
Between you and me
'Cause I'm missing your (ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
I'm missing your love (love-love-love)
I'm missing your (love-love-love)
I'm missing your love (love-love-love)
I'm missing your love (love-love-love)
I'm missing your love (love-love-love)
Taboo
When I'm out on the road (I'm missin' you)
Rockin' them shows (Missin' you)
Up in Monaco (I'm missin' you)
Making gold
When I'm AC plus (I'm missin' you)
And glamorous (Miss kissin' you)
But I miss your touch (I'm missin' you - oh-oh-oh)
Yeah, I miss your touch
I spend all my time (Missin' you)
With you in mind (Missin' you)
My mind's on you
'Cause all I am is missing you (I'm missin' you - missin' you)
(I'm missin' you)
(I'm missin' you)
Fergie
Since you've been away
Everything don't seem like they used to be
Between you and me
'Cause I'm missing your (ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
I'm missing your love (love-love-love)
I'm missing your (love-love-love)
I'm missing your love (love-love-love)
I'm missing your love (love-love-love)
I'm missing your love (love-love-love)
Without you, girl I don't know what to do without you 
apl.de.ap
Girl, I aint never had nothin' like this
When I'm all sprung caught up like this
Maybe it's your face, girl
Maybe it's your lips
Maybe it's the way you shake them hips
Baby it's the way you do what you do
That got me all love struck on you
I'll be just like an umbrella
The way I'm all over you
I know them other voice be callin' you
But they just want a piece
I want all of you
Take my time just spoilin' you
'Cause I know I'm in love with you (with you - with you)
Fergie
Please, baby, don't go
I'm needin' you now
I'm missin' you - Oh oh oh
I'm missin' you - Oh oh oh
I'm missin' you - Oh oh oh
I'm missin' you - Missin' you
I'm missin' you - I'm missin' you
will.i.am
Hey!
I miss your love, girl (love-love-love)
I miss - I miss your love
I miss your love, girl (love-love-love)
I miss - I miss your love
Hey!
I miss your love, girl (love-love-love)
I miss - I miss your love
I miss your love, girl (love-love-love)
I miss - I miss your love...love...love....
