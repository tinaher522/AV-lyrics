Yea
Kimmy kim kimmy kim kimmy kim kimmy kim
Why don't ya take it to the place where we're fillin' the skylight?
Where we'll be fillin' in the skylight
Uh huh
Check it out
(Will)
We be the connection to
Everything from calypso to
Hip hop down to bee bop
Now come rock slip slide to mine
B-boy niggas are gonna push butt
Rock-n-roll brothas are bound to serve it up
Got the leak so put the peas on turf
So get your waterproof walkman and go surf
John mcenroe get the kids all wacky
Jamal anderson look now he's from back in
The day now he runnin' over niggas for the fightin'
Instead of lookin' over all y'all brothas from the balcony
But we constructin' the bridge
So y'all could come and visit
This goes out to every pea that exists
How we doin' it?
Yo, it's like this
(Chorus:)
We bridging the gaps
We brought a little somethin' to
Start bridging the gaps
We brought a little somethin' to
Start bridging the gaps
We brought a little somethin' to
Start bridging the gaps
And it goes like...
(APL)
We direct, revolutionizing new concepts
Emergining binaries to prove success
Stereotypical they won't get it
We breakin' the barriers, some sonic shit
La to kingston to london bridge
New york to germany to brooklyn bridge
Also my people in the golden gate bridge
Innovators creatin' new rich
Got them skate kids sayin' "Let's rock"
Got them brothas sayin' "Yo let's get fly"
Got the whole south sayin' "You feel me?"
Got them chulos sayin' "You feel me?"
Every type of people be feelin' my section
Cuz we be expandin' to a wider selection
Now this goes out to everything that exists
Yo how we doin' it?
We do it like this
Come on
(Chorus:)
Do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do
(Taboo)
Legacy must live on
Legacy must live on
Legacy must live on
Make sure that the bridge is strong
Make sure that the gap is wide
Supply the future that we provide
Won't commit and just go inside
Give me room so I can dip and di
Show you how we hypnotize
Angry foot is gonna tell you why
We built this bridge for the people in the park
We built this bridge for the dummies in the dark
And we built this bridge for the children in the light
We built this bridge for the skeezers with sight
And we built this bridge for my brothas that are blind
We built this bridge for the ones that use their mind
And we built this bridge for everybody
For everybody
(Chorus:)
