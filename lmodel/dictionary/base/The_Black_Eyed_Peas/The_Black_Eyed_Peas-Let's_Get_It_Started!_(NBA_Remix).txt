<song artist="The_Black_Eyed_Peas" title="Let's_Get_It_Started!_(NBA_Remix)">
Let's get it started in here....... 
And the bass keeps runnin, runnin and runnin runnin' 
and runnin' runnin' and runnin' runnin' and runnin' runnin' 
and runnin' runnin' and runnin' runnin, and runnin' runnnin' 
and..... 
In this context, there's no disrespect 
So when I bust my rhyme, you break ya necks 
We got five minutes for us to disconnect 
From all intellect and let the rhythm effect 
Obstacles and inhibition follow your intuiton 
Free your inner soul and break away from tradition 
Cause when we be out, girlies pull the heat out 
You wouldn't believe how we wow shit out 
Burnin 'til it's burned out, turn it 'til it's turned out 
Act up from North West East South 
(Chorus:) 
Everybody, everybody, let's get into it. 
Get stupid. 
Get it started, get it started, Get it started, 
Let's get it started, (HA) 
Let's get it started, (In Here) 
Let's get it started, (HA) 
Let's get it started, (In Here) 
Let's get it started, (HA) 
Let's get it started, (In Here) 
Let's get it started, (HA) 
Let's get it started, (In Here) 
Yeah. 
Lose control, up outta your soul 
Don't move to fast, people, just take it slow 
Don't get ahead, just jump into it 
Y'all hear about it, the peas will do it 
Get started, get stupid 
Don't worry about it, people will walk you through it 
Step by step like your into new kid 
Inch by inch with the new solution 
Transmit hits with no delusion 
The feeling's irresistable and thats how we move it 
(Repeat Chorus:) 
Runnin' runnin' and runnin' runnin' and runnin' runnin' 
Come on y'all!
let's get (coo-koo) let's get (coo-koo) in here
while I'll get (coo-koo) let's get (coo-koo) in here
while I'll get (coo-koo) let's get (coo-koo) in here
Ohh ohh ohh, 
ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya... 
Let's get ill, thats the deal 
Apple the gate, and Will bring the bugged out drill (just) 
Lose your mind, this is the time 
Y'all can't stand still, trust and bang your spine (just) 
Bob your head like me Apple D
Up inside the club or in your Bentley 
Get messy, loud and sick 
You mind pass normal or another head trip 
So, come them now, do not correct it 
Let's get ignorant, let's get hectic 
(Repeat Chorus:) 
Whooah, 
coo-koo, (A-ha) coo-koo, (in here) 
coo-koo, (A-ha) coo-koo, (in here) 
coo-koo, (A-ha) coo-koo, (in here) 
Ohh ohh ohh, 
ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya 
And runnin' runnin' and runnin' runnin' and runnin' runnin' and..
