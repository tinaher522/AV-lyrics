Right now
Right now there's the the right time 
For the good thing tonight
Let's celebrate
Let's bring up on the better times
And not the sadder times
Dissipate(?)
Oh, I feel like a champion in the stadium
There's love ?
Imma put this in my memory 
As the best time ever
This is the best one yet
And I'm so happy
How could we ever forget
This is the best one
This is the best one
This is the best one yet (Oh-Oh-Wi-Oh)
And I'm so happy
How could we ever forget (Oh-Oh-Wi-Oh)
This is the best one
This is the best one
This is the best one yet
Let's celebrate, let's celebrate, let's celebrate (Oh-Oh-Wi-Oh)
Let's celebrate, let's celebrate, let's celebrate (Oh-Oh-Wi-Oh)
Let's do it right now
We're not hesitate
We gonna rock it to the top
Like elevate
Bottoms up
Here we go
Let's intoxicate
I was feeling good
But now I'm feeling afraid
Best ever
And you know I don't exaggerate 
This moment is the moment I will appreciate
Today is a day I will remember
This is the best one yet
And I'm so happy
How could we ever forget
This is the best one
This is the best one
This is the best one yet (Oh-Oh-Wi-Oh)
And I'm so happy
How could we ever forget (Oh-Oh-Wi-Oh)
This is the best one
This is the best one
This is the best one yet
Let's celebrate, let's celebrate, let's celebrate (Oh-Oh-Wi-Oh)
Let's celebrate, let's celebrate, let's celebrate (Oh-Oh-Wi-Oh)
This is your moment
This is your moment
This is the time
This is the time
To get it right tonight
To get it right
You don't wanna let the moment pass you by
So come on and save this one in a photograph
Everything I ? describe
It made us laugh
The night's young and we raise our glass
We'll make it count like the best one we ever had
The best one yet
The best one yet
The best one yet
The best one yet
The best one yet
The best one yet
This is the best one yet
The best one yet
The best one yet
The best one yet
The best one yet
The best one yet
The best one yet
This is the best one yet (Oh-Oh-Wi-Oh)
This is the best one yet
And I'm so happy
How could we ever forget
This is the best one
This is the best one
This is the best one yet (Oh-Oh-Wi-Oh)
And I'm so happy
How could we ever forget (Oh-Oh-Wi-Oh)
This is the best one
This is the best one - one yet
Let's celebrate, let's celebrate, let's celebrate (Oh-Oh-Wi-Oh)
Let's celebrate, let's celebrate, let's celebrate (Oh-Oh-Wi-Oh)
