Fergie
That's right... 
Huh!
You see these shoes 
On my feet? 
I'm 'bout to go, 
On out that door 
And you ain't stoppin' (What?)
Ain't none gon' stop it (What?)
'Cause I'm sick and tired of all them mother-mothers arguin'
What you think (Oh)
Imma go get a drink (Yeah)
Relax myself 
'Cause I'm about to blow 
When they open up the bar (What?)
Imma hit the bar (Let's go)
I didn't drive my car (Uh-huh)
So come on let's go (Let's go)
'Cause I'm steppin' outta here
'Cause where I'm goin'...I don't know 
I'm steppin' outta here
'Cause where I'm goin'...is outta my head 
Outta my head, outta my head, 
Outta my head, outta my head,
Outta my head, outta my head...oh!  
Steppin' steppin' out tonight, 
Got me goin' crazy
Steppin' steppin' out tonight, 
Got me goin' crazy
Steppin' steppin' out tonight, 
Got me goin' crazy
Steppin' steppin' out tonight, 
Got me goin' crazy
Yeah...
You see these feet 
Imma hit the streets 
Yeah, I'll be walkin'
Stalkin'
Imma hit the bar 
Get some vodka
Some Redbull
Yeah, happenin' 
When I see a boy
Imma say "Wassup?" 
will.i.am.
Hey girl, where you goin'? 
Fergie 
Won't you come with me?
We gon' live it up 
We steppin' now 
Aiight here we go 
Hold up hold up hold up 
How the bridge go? 
Ahh...I think I drank too much, 
Oh wait, I think I know it...
Okay, okay, here we go...
'Cause I'm steppin' outta here
'Cause where I'm goin'...I don't know 
I'm steppin' outta here
'Cause where I'm goin'...is outta my head 
Outta my head, outta my head, 
Outta my head, outta my head,
Outta my head, outta my head...oh!  
Steppin' steppin' out tonight, 
Got me goin' crazy
Steppin' steppin' out tonight, 
Got me goin' crazy
Steppin' steppin' out tonight, 
Got me goin' crazy
Steppin' steppin' out tonight, 
Got me goin' crazy
will.i.am.
I'm goin' out of my head...
La di di la di da
