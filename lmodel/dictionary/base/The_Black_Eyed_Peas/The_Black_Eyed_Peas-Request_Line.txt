Black Eyed Peas - Request Line feat. Macy Gray
Pick up the phone call up the line
Call up the re-quest line
Call up the line
Call up the re-quest line
Nana nana nananana na na nana nana
So call up the line
Get down wit, down wit us
{Macy Gray}
This is a request Mr. Radio Man
Just one desire from a hip-hop fan
Hey D.J. (You're on the line girl)
Hey D.J. (On the request line girl)
Play the record by my favorite band
I like to hear my favorite song on the radio
So I called and requested on the radio
Tell the D.J. spin it on the mix show
Make a brother feel like I'm down at the disco
And we gonna keep it going like Crisco
Cause the D.J. grab the record by the fist full
by the crate full, and we grateful
When you hear the stuff of records that are tasteful
{Macy Gray} Last night the D.J. saved my life
Cause the selection of the records he played
To the direction of the record we swayed
And all night through the session we stayed
Cause you know you got the feeling
{Macy Gray} All right
Good god got the feeling
{Macy Gray} All right
Touch the ceiling when I'm feelin'

Don't stop keep it goin' now come on

Turn-table-ist bless me on my stereo

Never afraid to be creative on your radio
Spin my jam when I'm cruisin' down the barrio
Turn my audio up, create a party yo

And get my rock get my roll get my hip-hop on
