(Boy, I think about it every night and day
I'm addicted, wanna jump inside your love
I wouldn't wanna have it any other way
I'm addicted and I just can't get enough)
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough
Honey got a sexy all steamin'
She givin' hotness a new meanin'
Perfection, mama, you gleamin'
Inception you got a brother dreamin', dreamin'
Damn, baby, I'm feignin'
I'm tryin-a holler at you, I'm screamin'
Let me love you down this evenin'
(Love you, love you, yeah, you know you are my demon)
Girl, we could form a team and
I could be the king, you could be the queen and
My mind's dirty and it don't need cleanin'
(I love you long time so you know the meanin')
Oh, baby, I can't come down so, please, come help me out
You got me feelin' high and I can't step off the cloud
And I just can't get enough
(Boy, I think about it every night and day
I'm addicted, wanna jump inside your love
I wouldn't wanna have it any other way
I'm addicted and I just can't get enough)
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough
Honey got me runnin' like I'm Flo Jo
Signed her name on my heart with an XO
Love so sweet, got me vexed though
I wanna wish it right back like Presto, yes
Meantime I wait for the next time
She come around for a toast to the best time
We LOL back and forth on the text line
She got me fishin' for her love, I confess I'm
Somethin 'bout her smile and the convo
Got me high and I ain't comin' down, yo
My heart's pumpin out louder than electro
She got me feelin like (Mr. Roboto)
Oh, baby, I can't come down so, please, come help me out
You got me feelin' high and I can't step off the cloud
And I just can't get enough
(Boy, I think about it every night and day
I'm addicted, wanna jump inside your love
I wouldn't wanna have it any other way
I'm addicted and I just can't get enough)
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough
(This has been a switchup)
Switchup!
Switchup!
I just can't (Switchup)
Locked, sunk in your bed-rock
Heart, pumpin your love-shot
Knocked, out by your cold-shot
I'm, stuck in your head-lock (Switchup)
Can't-can't stop-stop won't-won't quit-quit
Makin me f-f-f-f-f-fiend, give it to me
I want it all-all, know what I mean
Your love is a dose of ecsta (Switchup)
Addicted, I can't get away from you
Afflicted, I need it, I miss it (Switchup)
I want your lovin' right next to me
And I can't erase you out of my memory-ory
I, just can't (Switchup)
