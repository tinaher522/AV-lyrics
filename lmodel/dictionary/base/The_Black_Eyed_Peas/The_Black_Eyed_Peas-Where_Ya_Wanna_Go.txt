Pretty lady how you been? 
What you doing? What you need? 
What's your name? What's your style? 
What you think? What's on your mind? 
Come with me we'll spend some time, 
Can i try to make you mine? 
Are You single? Let me know, 
All these things I wanna know. 
Lady lady come with me, 
Hop inside my love machine, 
We can share the energy, 
Make a pretty melody, 
La-Da-Dee, La-Dee-Da, 
Speical woman is what you are, 
We can take it to the stars, 
and we can go far and beyond. 
Tell me where ya wanna go, 
Where ya wanna go? 
Baby we could take it fast, 
We could take it slow. 
Give me one night and I can make you my, 
Sweet Love. 
Girl you know, you the one, 
We should go, have some fun, 
Let me whip, get me sprung
All my niggers think im dumb, 
I don't care, I love you, 
You love me, Yeah that's true, 
That's the only thing that matters, 
La-Dee-Dee, La-Dee-Da, 
What you love is what we are,
Be me light, be my star, 
Be my L-O-V-E-R, 
Let the love,
Love is on,
We can go far and beyond. 
Tell me where ya wanna go, 
Where ya wanna go? 
Baby we could take it fast, 
We could take it slow. 
Tell me what you wanna do, 
What you wanna do? 
Maybe you could fall for me, 
and I could fall for you. 
Give me one night and I can make you my, 
Sweet Love. 
Baby, Baby, Let me know,

Sweet Love. 
Uh, ill take you to my room
I know you in the mood
I told you once before before my space ship it go zoom

Lets rendezvous in dallas
Take private planes through central bay and wonderland like alice
Well travel through the stars and baby well go far
So grad up on this venus make my milky way through mars
So baby roll with me
Explore these galaxies
I show you that I love you gi-girl you the one for me, Yeah.
