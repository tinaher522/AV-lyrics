Let's get retarded, in here...
will.i.am
And the bass keep runnin' runnin', 
And runnin' runnin', 
And runnin' runnin',
And runnin' runnin',
And runnin' runnin', 
And runnin' runnin', 
And runnin' runnin', 
And runnin' runnin', and...
In this context, there's no disrespect, 
So, when I bust my rhyme, you break your necks
We got five minutes for us to disconnect
From all intellect and let the rhythm effect
Obstacles are inefficient, follow your intuition, 
Free your inner soul and break away from tradition
'Cause when we beat out, girl is pullin' without
You wouldn't believe how we wow shit out
Burn it till it's burned out, turn it till it's turned out
Act up from north, west, east, south
Everybody, everybody,
Let's get into it
Get stupid (Come on)
Get retarded (Come on)
Get retarded (Yeah)
Get retarded
Let's get retarded (Ha), let's get retarded in here
Let's get retarded (Ha), let's get retarded in here
Let's get retarded (Ha), let's get retarded in here
Let's get retarded (Ha), let's get retarded in here
Yeah
Taboo
(Oh) Lose control, of body and soul
Don't move too fast, people, just take it slow
Don't get ahead, just jump into it
Ya'll hear about it, the Peas'll do it
Get stutted, get stupid
Don't worry 'bout itâ€”people will walk you through it
Step by step, like you're into new kid
Inch by inch with the new solution
Transmit hits, with no delusion
The feeling's irresistible and that's how we movin'
Everybody, everybody,
Let's get into it
Get stupid (Come on)
Get retarded (Come on)
Get retarded (Yeah)
Get retarded
Let's get retarded (Ha), let's get retarded in here
Let's get retarded (Ha), let's get retarded in here
Let's get retarded (Ha), let's get retarded in here
Let's get retarded (Ha), let's get retarded in here
Yeah
The bass keeps runnin' runnin', 
And runnin' runnin', 
And runnin' runnin',
And runnin' runnin', and...
