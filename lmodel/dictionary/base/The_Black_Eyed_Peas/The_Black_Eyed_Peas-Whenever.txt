<song artist="The_Black_Eyed_Peas" title="Whenever">
[Fergie]
Look through the tree
past the sky
beyond the northern light
you will see my delight
back the in your eyes
And I won't let go if you wait for me
whenever whatever
and you select the destination
whatever whenever
I walk through
whatever whenever
I walk through
I wa-I wa-I wanna
love forever love forever baby
whenever wherever you wanna go one day
to do whatever do whatever baby
whenever wherever forever together whenever
[will.i.am]
I fell asleep
don't know why
you let me come alive
you and me
we collide
ignite the starry fire
[Fergie]
and you warm me up and you wait for it
whenever whatever
and you
you wake me up and you wait for it
whenever whenever
I wanna go
whatever whenever
I walk through
I wa-I wa-I wanna
love forever love forever baby
whenever wherever you wanna go one day
to do whatever do whatever baby
whenever wherever forever together whenever
whatever whatever whatever whatever whatever whatever whatever whatever
[will.i.am]
I love you forever and ever for always I love you
whenever you need me
I'll be there right by you
whenever you call me
I'm there when you call
whenever your falling
I'm there when you fall
whenever you going
I'll be right there showing
our love's always growing
and growing and growing
I know that you know it
there's no need for guessing
when I am requested
I'm there with no questions asked
I'll go wherever whenever
if ever you need me
I'll be there forever
