(Yo. Y'hear them sirens? I know you hear 'em. Don't be scared.) 
That ain't five-0 (naw) 
That's the funk y'all (yeah) 
Don't act like you didn't know (naw) 
That's just the way it goes (yeah) 
When you messin' with the funk (yeah) 
You pumpin' in ya trunk (yeah) 
You know it's what you want (yeah) 
So just pump the pump (the pump, pump it up!) 
Bounce Boo to the boogie that be 
You know I want you to come boogie with me 
We can dip left slide right all night 
It's time to be wild, freestyle 
It's on and poppin' 
Ain't no stoppin' us from rockin' 
From tonight to ten o'clock in the morning 
Got neighbours knockin (Turn it down!) fuck 'em 
Go call them cops and watch them pigs walk in 
Start boppin' heads to what that DJ droppin' 
He play funk, punk, and hip-hop and 
Breakin' laws, yeah culture shockin' 
We be pop rockin and moshin 
I get down and groove to cuts, check my art of movin butts 
Now days cats are scared of death (that's right) 
This beat bangs, here's my chance 
Come on girl, let's go, I can't dance on the floor (ahh) 
Bounce boo to the boogie that be 
You know I want you to come boogie with me 
We can dip left, slide right all night 
It's time to be wild, freestyle 
We can dance, and dance, dance (Come on baby) 
Said we can dance, and dance, dance (oh oh oh oh oh) 
I wanna dance, and dance, dance (yeah, yeah, yeah) 
Oh we can dance, and dance, dance 
Furgie's chillin, always illin 
The way I make ya sway, ya feelin 
That's how it is get down and jam 
If y'all don't understand, check it 
He rock makin , street block shakin 
Club life's great when it's house quakin 
Speakers thumpin, whole joint jumpin 
Disco funkin, get ya booty pumpin 
This beat's bangin, I'm rap talkin 
Sweet spit slangin, keep ya feet hoppin 
Dirty dancin, nasty, naughty 
Move that chassis, pump it hottie 
Coz when I hear music, I just lose it 
I wanna do it, with you (you, you, you) 
And when I hear music, I get into it 
I wanna do it with you (ahh) 
Bounce boo to the boogie that be 
You know I want you to come boogie with me 
We can dip left, slide right all night 
It's time to be wild, freestyle 
We can dance, and dance, dance (come on baby) 
Said we can dance, and dance, dance (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh) 
I wanna dance, and dance, dance (yeah, yeah) 
Oh, we can dance, and dance, dance

Yeah, freak, freak (ahh) 
You know that sounds sweet (ahh) 
Let's freak, freak (ahh) 
And do it to the beat (ahh) 
Y'all! What the hell y'all come here for 
If y'all ain't out there on that floor 
Ya asked me to bring it,

I'll give it to ya raw, give it to ya hardcore 
Don't contaminate it, I'mma keep this pure 
Just for ya freak, ya's pleaure 
Coz all I wanna do is have a ball, y'all 
Get on the floor y'all and freak, freak y'all 
We can dance, and dance, dance (come on baby) 
Said we can dance, and dance, dance (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh) 
I wanna dance, and dance, dance (yeah, yeah) 
Oh we can dance, and dance, dance (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!)
