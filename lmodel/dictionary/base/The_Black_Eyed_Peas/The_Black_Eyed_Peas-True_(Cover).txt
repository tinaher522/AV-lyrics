<song artist="The_Black_Eyed_Peas" title="True_(Cover)">
Yeah, I know, I know
Yeah, It's true, It's true
(Fergie)
Huh huh huh hu-uh huh
I know this much is true
Huh huh huh hu-uh huh
I know this much is true
(Will I Am)
Hey x 6 (Its true)
My x6 (Is true)
Hey x 6 (Its true)
So true funny how it seems
always in time, but never in line for dreams
Head over heels when toe to toe
This is the sound of my soul,
this is the sound
(Will I Am)
I know you love the way my love is soundin
From over there you can hear my heart poundin
Let me swim in and out 
I'm drownin
Forever I be upside down frownin
I love you up town, love you down townin
You could be my woman
I could be your main man
And thats why I sat down and wrote this poem
Cause I want the truth to be told
(Fergie)
Boy you know I know that its true
Huh huh huh hu-uh huh
I know this much is true
Huh huh huh hu-uh huh
I know this much is true
(Will I Am)
Hey x 6 (Its true)
My x6 (Is true)
Hey x 6 (Its true)
(Fergie)
With a thrill in my head, and a pill on my tongue
Dissolves the nerves that just begun
Listenin to Marvin (all night long)
This is the sound of my soul
This is the sound
(Will I Am)
Yah- I love the way your soul sounds to me
Ain't nobody doin me the way you do me
I got the stamina for L.O.V.E
Rip out the camera, lets make a movie
In the future we can look back at what we done did
You been makin love to me like a hundred
And that's why I had to remix this song
Cause I want the truth to be told
(Fergie)
Boy you know I know that its true
Huh huh huh hu-uh huh
I know this much is true
Huh huh huh hu-uh huh
I know this much is true
(Will I Am)
Hey x 6 (Its true)
My x6 (Is true)
Hey x 6 (Its true)
You know its true x3
(You know I love you girl)
I know, I know, I know
This much is true
You know its true x3
(Yeah)
This much is true, This much is true
(You know I love you girl)
(I know you love me girl)
