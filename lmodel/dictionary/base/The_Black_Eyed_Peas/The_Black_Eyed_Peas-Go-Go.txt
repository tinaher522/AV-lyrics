<song artist="The_Black_Eyed_Peas" title="Go-Go">
Are we all victims of opportunity
Locked outside the door back in '83
I heard the angry voice of the man
Inside and saw the look of fear
In my mother's eyes
Go go go go
I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know
Mom get in the car and let's
Drive away she said "I'm
Sorry Mark but there's
Nowhere to stay", gave up
All her hope and went back inside
Hid her broken heart and let
The engine die
Go go go go
I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know
Why do evil man get away with
It? Can't you see that I'm in a
World of shit? Turn your back
On hope and go back inside
Stop my bleeding heart and
Let the engine die
I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know
