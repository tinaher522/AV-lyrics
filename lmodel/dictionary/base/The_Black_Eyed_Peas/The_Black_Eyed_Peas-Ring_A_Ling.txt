Pick it up, pick it up, no warning
I'ma answer the phone for she on it
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I want it late at night, tip bang
You could go get right, get right long as the head's right
Me and you in the whip of the red light
So put it all over me, all over me
Tell me where you wanna go, tell me how you wanna feel
Baby, we could do it fast, baby, we can do it slow
Tell me where you wanna go, tell me where you wanna be
Yeah, and I hope that it's next to me
You don't wanna have sex with me
Then why you keep texting me
Alright I'ma hit you back later
Honey, I, oh I, I got something for you baby
'Cause if I'm calling at 2 in the mornin'
It only means one thing baby
