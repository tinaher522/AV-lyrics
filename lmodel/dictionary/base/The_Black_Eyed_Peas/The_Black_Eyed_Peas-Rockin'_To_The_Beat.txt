<song artist="The_Black_Eyed_Peas" title="Rockin'_To_The_Beat">
Rockin' to the beat, rockin' to the beat
Rockin' to the beat, rockin' to the beat
Rockin' to the beat
Rockin' to the beat, rockin' to the beat
The beat, the beat, the beat
Rockin' to the beat, rockin' to the beat
Rockin' to the beat, rockin' to the beat
Rockin' to the beat
Keep comin' in with the disco jam
Step in the place and people like, damn
Party get started with a cool and the fam
Gotta get naughty and do all I can
What is band that can't really rock?
What's an M.C. that's rockin' the spot?
What is a mic that ain't got no cable?
What's a DJ without the turntable?
What's a hot girl if she can't really dance?
What's electro without wearing tight pants?
What is a rhythm if it just don't bump?
Baby, let me get it and give you what you want
Give you what you need, baby, how you want it?
Time to get nasty, get your ass on it
Time to get on it, on it, on it
Time to get on it
Rockin' to the beat, rockin' to the beat
Rockin' to the beat, rockin' to the beat
Rockin' to the beat, the beat, the beat, the beat
Rockin' to the beat, rockin' to the beat
Rockin' to the beat, rockin' to the beat
Rockin' to the beat, the beat, the, the
Rockin' to the beat, rockin' to the beat
Rockin' to the beat, rockin' to the beat
Rockin' to the beat
Rockin' to the beat, rockin' to the beat
Rockin' to the beat, rockin' to the beat
