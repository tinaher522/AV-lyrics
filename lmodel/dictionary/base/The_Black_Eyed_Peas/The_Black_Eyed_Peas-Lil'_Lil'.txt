Artist: Black Eyed Peas
Get on, up and…
People hate the place, just
Get down, rock with the Peas
The BEP crew, and …
(Verse one)
People get my pan ‘cause we dropin' it (‘cause we dropin' it)
Motivetin' everybody when we rockin' it (when we rockin' it)
But they envy us, they keep the premises (keep the premises)
‘Cause they actin' up jealous, sensitive (stop crying)
‘Cause we delve and tell it, we display it (we display it)
Certified to be the -ish when it's waning in (when it's waning in)
Plus, it's to damn heavy for you to carry in your crew (crew, gain shock)
Shock by my current and…
People want a place that dig it and relate (they like it)
When I vision in the space (they love it)
When I'm switchin' up the pace
‘Cause they need it
‘Cause it turns them on
They want it
So I'ma hit'em with a fate (fate)
‘Cause we deliver that old cosmic shit (cosmic shit)
Combined with elements from 1986 ('86)
And blendin' it with, into galactic tricks
Look chick, there will always be the Peas
Ain't really no other entity to bring the breeze
Wins that pull you in like tornadoes
And we grab a mike to let you know
(Chorus)
‘Cause I give a lil' lil'
You take a lil' lil'
Lets step a lil' lil'
And make a lil' lil'
Of LOVE (la la la la la)
‘Cause we can (la la la la la)
I give a lil' lil'
You take a lil' lil'
Lets step a lil' lil'
And shake a lil' lil'
Of ASS (la la la la la)
‘Cause we can (la la la la la)(check it out)
(Verse two)
It's necessary for me to be accurate (to be accurate)
Exacting every angle plus immaculate (plus immaculate)
Letin' everybody know that we dropin' it (that we dropin' it)
When we stepin' to the place ain't no stopin' it (ain't no stopin' it)
Cas' I'm gon' hit cha lovely with my HIP (with my HIP)
Makin' dance to my HOP fanatically (aha)
Pornographically we bring it to you musically (musically)
Get you naked mentally and controllably
Master to hitch a ride down to your shedder
Give ya butterflies in your stomach and uplift ya
The legendary sound that we do
The transcend ascentin' this out to you
(Chorus)
(Verse three)
Hey, we be rockin' it
Get down rock and shockin' it
BEP, the rime aristocrats
Get a hint and catch your hump attack
‘Cause when you tinkle your spirit with the sound
Ripple throw your body with the sound
Black Eyed Peas are know known electrified
We intensify getcha satisfied
(Chorus)
(Verse four)
People want a place that dig it and relate (they like it)
When I vision in the place (they love it)
When I'm switchin' up the pace
‘Cause they need it
‘Cause it turns them on
They want it
People want a place (they like it)
When I vision in the space (they love it)
The Peas are switchin' up the pace
Ta ta ta ta ta ta oooohhhh baby
Ta ta ta ta ta ta oooohhhh yeah
