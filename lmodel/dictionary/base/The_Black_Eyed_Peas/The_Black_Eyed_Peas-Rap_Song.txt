<song artist="The_Black_Eyed_Peas" title="Rap_Song">
Wyclef on guitar.. with the black eyed peas
Here go the rap song, they wanna sing it to y'all
She like a rap song (she like a rap song)
She like a rap song (she like a rap song)
She like a rap song (she like a rap song)
She like a rap song (she like a rap song)
You're like a hip-hop song y'know
I wanna be your "buddy" like de la soul
Let me "rock +them+ bells" like I'm ll
I like you in a kangol and gazelles
Here's a ticket come and see me on my "planet rock"
Like the daddy kane, I can be your "smooth op'"
But wait-uh every month you're the flavor
I wanna get a scoop - lat-uh!
She like a rap song (she like a rap song)
She like a rap song ..
She make me clap (how's that) cause she a rap song
She like a rap song
She like a rap song (she like a rap song)
She like a rap song ..
She make me clap (how's that) cause she a rap song
She like a rap song
She was the, "public enemy #1"
She was my, "mona lisa" when we first begun
She got me, "jump-in' around" like Everlast
Singin a, "rap life" with help from tash
She be my, metronome rhythm to my feet
And when we, when we do it do it to the beat
She like, "my melody" done by Eric B., and Rakim
Cause she be rockin me steadily, yo
Yo, she got hips to hops
And she ain't goin' pop
She like a record that I wanna rock
When I'm rollin in my ride cruisin down my block
Yo, and if she was a rap song
She'd be "bonita applebum"
And I wanna put you on
I'm puttin you on, you're my favorite song
She like a rap song (she like a rap song)
She like a rap song ..
She make me clap (how's that) cause she a rap song
She like a rap song
She like a rap song (she like a rap song)
She like a rap song ..
She make me clap (how's that) cause she a rap song
She like a rap song
She makes me say 'ho' but she ain't a "hoe!!"
She "got it made" wit
