<song artist="The_Black_Eyed_Peas" title="Say_Goodbye">
1992 and, you and I were fightin'
LAPD beatings got the whole world frontin
My man rodney king and the reginaldÂ ? deeney?
You could look for justice but I bet you won't find any
Because people getting beatin', news keep repeatin'
Chaos and anger, just surely peakin'
Yo everybody's runnin', some of them are gunnin
Avalanche the block, feel the anger, wantin something
'cause some of them are frontin
They didn't know the reason
Emotion in the end made it feel like revolution
And yeah, yeah, you can yell out your brains
I tell you right now, we got 8 years of chains
So hurry up because I'm runnin' out of clip
Runnin' out of time
Runnin' out of clip
Runnin' out of time
Runnin' out of clip
Runnin' out of time
Runnin' out of clip
Runnin' out of time
1997, reduction of a nation
The government is slayin', new laws is what you're facin'
Next comes the clonin, they're makin new creation
Secretly forming soldiers of you and they station
No more free education on former segregation
Politics' about affirmative activation
So make a run for the border
Caught by the deporter
The immigration caught you but you got to leave your daughter
We are slowly being slaughtered
So be prepared for the new world order
Yeah, yeah, you can yell out your brains
I tell you right now, we got eight years of chains
So hurry up because I'm runnin' out of clip
Runnin' out of time
Runnin' out of clip
Runnin' out of time
Runnin' out of clip
Runnin' out of time
Runnin' out of clip
Runnin' out of time
Year 2000, what's it really holdin'
Or is it really right, live beyond on what you're knowing
Or is it that technology is what keeps on going
Could it be that the end of time is what I'm showing
I don't see any grass growin
Everything's conquered, we're runnin' out of land
And goddamn yo, I'm runnin' out of clip
I'm almost out of time
Runnin' out of...
Damn, I'm almost out of time
We could all try now but just look up in the sky
We ain't got no ozone left, we are gonna die
Crime and corruption, is the only season
Is it 'cause the reason is that we out of time.
