[will.i.am]
Hey girl you know you special
When you jump to the phone give you best-o
I wanna hold you tight, never let go
'Cause your love is like magic presto
Girl let's tangle up like a pretzel
C'mon switch your lover, baby let's go
Girl I put you on a trance like TiÃ«sto
But I ain't talk about tech - techno
Girl, you stole my heart like a klepto
Butterflies in my stomach, need Pepto...
Bismol baby gimme more sex-to
It's your pleasure like I'm gecko
Girl will I stop loving you? Heck no
Honestly I think you got me in a heck-show
When I'm with you is so perfecto
And when I leave you hit me with a text
And you talk about that XOXOXO
That XOXOXO
Hit me with a XOXOXO
That XOXOXO
Baby everywhere I go
I'm not alone
You let me know
You're on my phone
You're in my dreams
You're on my screen
You send me X and O's, X and O's
[Fergie]
Hugs and kisses, hugs and kisses
Hugs and kisses, X and O's
Hugs and kisses, hugs and kisses
Hugs and kisses, X and O's
[All]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I'll be waiting on the phone for your tech show
I wanna stay connected like Lego
You're the gas to my car, you're my petrol
Me and you go back, retro
Every time I get some I wanna get more
Every time you away I wanna get close
Is the loving that you give me just echoes (echoes)
Got me dumb, got me spunk 'cause it's sex-o
So good, I wanna show it like an expo
I can't let go, let go my ego
You're my number one, you're my bebot
You're the only one for me 'cause I said so
Girl you won my heart, you need a medal
'Cause now I ain't looking for the next, yo
When I meet you is so perfecto
I wanna go, I'll be waiting for your text
I'll be missing your XOXOXO
That XOXOXO
Girl you're so xoxo-lent, XOXO-lent
Baby everywhere I go
I'm not alone
You let me know
You're on my phone
You're in my dreams
You're on my screen
You send me X and O's, X and O's
[Fergie]
Hugs and kisses, hugs and kisses
Hugs and kisses, X and O's
Hugs and kisses, hugs and kisses
Hugs and kisses, X and O's

This is big mega love song
For the lovers, for the lovely lo - lovers
[Taboo]
Love her, need her, can't leave her
Ring, ring for ever
Light talk, wife talk, wedding ring
We are holding hands
Doing love and talk
Doing love and talk
Doing love and talk
We stay kissing
Permanent, lips
Locking, locking, boots... not, not, boots
Break it down to the ground
Love my honey down
Love my honey down
Love my honey down
