will.i.am
I got so much love
For you darlin' and I...
I wanna let you know how I feel
And it's true that I love you
And it's true you're the only one
And I do, I adore ya
And it's true, girl
You make me feel ali-i-i-ive
You make me feel ali-i-i-ive
You make me feel ali-i-i-ive
You make me feel ali-i-i-i-i-
Fergie
You say-you say-you say that I'm the only one
You say that I'm your number one
Now you're gone and I feel numb
Tell me where did we go wrong
You were my best friend and boyfriend
Now it seems like you're my worst friend
I gotta do soul-searchin'
Without you I'm a whole different person
I ain't actin' like I used to
I don't feel loved like I used to
It was your love I was used to
Why did I had to lo-lo-lo-lose
Your love, your love, your love
Your love is what it was
That had me feeling buzzed
You are my true love
will.i.am
And it's true that I love you
And it's true you're the only one
And I do, I adore ya
And it's true, girl
You make me feel ali-i-i-ive
You make me feel ali-i-i-ive
You make me feel ali-i-i-ive
You make me feel ali-i-i-i-i-
apl.de.ap
Hey girl, you're the only one
Supposed to be my number one
Now you're gone now I feel so numb
Tell me how did we go (wrong)
First friends, then we became best friends
You used to be my girlfriend, now you're my worst friend
Yeah, I gotta do a little soul searching
Without you I'm a whole different person
I don't even act like how I would used to
I don't even feel love like I used to
I guess it's your love that I'm used to
Damn, I feel bad I had to lose you
I got so many things that I wanna s-s-s-s...
I guess this means that I'm missing you
Sorry for the things that I did to you
I'm so lost without you
will.i.am
And it's true that I love you
And it's true you're the only one
And I do, I adore ya
And it's true, girl
You make me feel ali-i-i-ive
You make me feel ali-i-i-ive
You make me feel ali-i-i-ive
You make me feel ali-i-i-i-i-

Taboo
So easy to fall in love with you
And all the things that you do
Baby girl, you're so remarkable
So special, so wonderful
So special, so wonderful
So special, so wonderful
Baby girl, you're so remarkable
So special-al-al-al-al
