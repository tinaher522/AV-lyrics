More (more)
More (more)
Check it out everybody here we go (c'mon) 
Now stop, keep it jumpin' on the floo' (jump)
Bust through the roof white bro (oh)
Rose to the top we're the cream of the crop
When's the last time you heard it this hot? 
Black Eyed Peas and you know we don't stop (c'mon)
Roll it up a little bit and make it drop (drop) 
Internationally selling and you know how we do
You know the B.E.P will make you bounce (c'mon)
Demonstrate a new way of gettin' down 
We get, we gettin' down in your town
spittin' that funk all around
stompin' on the ground 
Yeah we be up in the place 
People gather round, have a taste
Melodies all up in your face 
We droppin that fluid and you know how we do it
They want, they want, they want, More
You got, you got, you got, More 
They want, they want, they want, More
You got, you got, you got, More 
They want, they want, they want, More
You got, you got, you got, More 
They want, they want, they want, More
You got, you got, you got...
Party people, all the party people, all the party people, all the party people
Party people, all the party people, all the party people, all the party people
Worlwide fashion rhyme everlasting
Keeping it fresh rockin' it with a passion

apl.de.ap, the man with the flow 
Breaking it down like this here we go 
Yeah we be up in the place 
People gather round, have a taste
Melodies all up in your face 
We droppin that fluid and you know how we do it
They want, they want, they want, More
You got, you got, you got, More 
They want, they want, they want, More
You got, you got, you got, More 
They want, they want, they want, More
You got, you got, you got, More 
They want, they want, they want, More
You got, you got, you got...
Where's the party at? (x8)
Party people
all the party people (x4) 
Yeah we partyin' in the place 
people gather round, have a taste
We got melodies all up in your face 
We droppin that fluid and you know how we do it
They want, they want, they want, More
You got, you got, you got, More 
They want, they want, they want, More
You got, you got, you got, More 
They want, they want, they want, More
You got, you got, you got, More 
They want, they want, they want, More
You got, you got, you got More
