Mmmmm
La La La La La La La La, La La La La 
La La La La La La La La, La La La La
La La La La La La La La, La La La La
Mmmmm
You were fooling me once before but I tell ya
There's no fooling me twice no more
'Cuz when I open up my third eye, my third eye
Try to get away with murder, with murder
Yeah, you was fooling me once before
But I tell ya, there's no fooling me twice no more
So stop your oppression, oppression
Check it out, I got a question, a question:
If Bush is Pinocchio, Pinocchio,
who the hell is Geppetto, Geppetto?
Beware of Geppetto.
(Rap)
cause he got eyes and clips on the back of that ship
two grusome flicks give to you brother.....
He was fooling me once before
But I tell ya, he ain't fooling me twice no more
'Cuz when I open up my third eye, my third eye
He can't get away with murder, with murder
Know what I'm sayin'?
Oh no no can't fool me again
Oh no no won't trip on games you play, I know your game
Oh no no won't fall down again
Oh no no won't trip on games you play, I know your game
You can fool me once, but you can't fool me two times
'Cuz I got three eyes, one upon the left side
Get it from the right inside
Right in on the inside
'Cuz I can see you outside trying to come in
La La La La La La La La (You can't fool me)
La La La La La La La La (You can't do me)
La La La La La La La La (Can't run through me)
Mmm, yeah
La La La La La, La La La La La
Sometimes we need to change
To change, to change
Leave the past behind
Leave the past behind, love, shall we?
Look into the future, look ahead
That's right
