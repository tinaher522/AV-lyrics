<song artist="The_Black_Eyed_Peas" title="Simp">
Tell me, what's making you jump like that? 
S-I-M-P, squirrels in my pants 
Ain't got no chickens, ain't got no rats 
S-I-M-P, squirrels in my pants 
S to the I to the M to the P 
Then maybe you can be moving like me
Step right over and watch me put it down 
(Squirrels, squirrels)
Step right over and watch me put it 
S to the I to the M to the P
Who you got back home, watering your plants? 
S-I-M-P, squirrels in my pants 
How can I qualify for government grants? 
S-I-M-P, squirrels in my pants 
Hypnotize me, put me in a trance 
S-I-M-P, squirrels in my pants 
Got an Aunt Florance livin' in France 
She can't see the squirrels in my pants
Step right over and watch me put it down 
(Squirrels, squirrels) 
Step right over and watch me put it 
S to the I to the M to the P
