Don't, don't, don't, don't, 
Don't, don't, don't, don't, 
Don't, don't, don't, don't stop the party. 
Don't, don't, don't, don't, 
Don't, don't, don't, don't, 
Stop, stop, stop, 
The, the, the, don't stop the party. 
Don't stop the party 
Don't, don't, don't, don't, 
Don't, don't, don't, don't, 
Stop, stop, stop, 
The, the, the, don't stop the party. 
This is that original, 
This has no identical, 
You can't have my digital, 
Future aboriginal, 
Get up off my genitals, 
I stay on that pinnacle, 
Chewin up my lryicals, 
Call me verbal criminal, 
Send you to that clinical, 
Subscribe use of chemicals, 
I.D.O. and visual, can't see me, invisible. 
I old school like Biblical, 
Futuristic next level, 
Never on that typical 
Will I stop? I never know... 
Fergie
I ain't gonna stop until I'm done (don't stop it) 
I ain't gonna quit until I've won
will.i.am
Now baby don't you stop it, stop it 
Now baby don't you stop it, stop it 
Now baby don't you stop it, stop it, stop it 
You can't stop us now...
Fergie
I ain't gonna stop until I'm done (don't stop it) 
I ain't gonna quit should I've won
will.i.am
Now baby don't you stop it, stop it 
Now baby don't you stop it, stop it 
Now baby don't you stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it 
Even if wanna to, you can't stop us now... 
Don't stop the party 
Don't, don't, don't, don't, 
Don't, don't, don't, don't, 
Stop, stop, stop, 
The, the, the, don't stop the party. 
Don't, don't, don't, don't, 
Don't, don't, don't, don't, 
Stop, stop, stop, 
The, the, the, don't stop the party.

You could cause me crazy man, 
Everyday I'm party'in, 
You could find me at the club, 
Pop'n bottles, minglin, 
Ladies danc'in to the jam, 
Actin' all day, man, oh man, 
Got me in the mood again, 
At the party, partyin', 
Yeah, I get that happenin', 
Taken shots, whatever man 
Party like a veteran, 
Music is my medicine, 
You, and Bobby Settlan, 
Can't restart I'm steppin' in, 
Take control and feel the band 
Yeah, that's right, everyone jam. 
Taboo
I'm that one that lights it up 
We red hot like firetrucks, 
Burn that book, that what's up, 
Tell that DJ turn it up. 
We droppin, that music, good people all around 
We rockin', head knockin', 'coz they can't shut us down. 
Ain't, ain't no stoppin' 
We gonna keep on rockin', 
Baby ain't no stoppin, 
You cannot stop us now. 
Fergie
I ain't gonna stop until I'm done (don't stop it) 
I ain't gonna quit should I've won
will.i.am 
Now baby don't you stop it, stop it 
Now baby don't you stop it, stop it 
Now baby don't you stop it, stop it, stop it 
You can't stop us now...
Fergie 
I ain't gonna stop until I'm done (don't stop it) 
I ain't gonna quit should I've won
will.i.am
Now baby don't you stop it, stop it 
Now baby don't you stop it, stop it 
Now baby don't you stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it 
Even if wanna to, you can't stop us now... 
Don't stop the party 
Don't, don't, don't, don't, 
Don't, don't, don't, don't, 
Stop, stop, stop, 
The, the, the, don't stop the party. 
Don't, don't, don't, don't, 
Don't, don't, don't, don't, 
Stop, stop, stop, 
The, the, the, don't stop the party. 
Don't, don't, don't, don't, 
Don't, don't, don't, don't, 
Stop, stop, stop, 
The, the, the, don't stop the party. 
Don't, don't, don't, don't, 
Don't, don't, don't, don't, 
Stop, stop, stop, 
The, the, the, don't stop the party.
