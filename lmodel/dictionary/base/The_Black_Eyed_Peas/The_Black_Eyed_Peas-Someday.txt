<song artist="The_Black_Eyed_Peas" title="Someday">
[will.i.am]
Someday I'm gonna get it right my life
Someday I'm gonna figure it out maybe tonight
'Cause i know imma get it right
And i know imma get it right
Someday, one day
Someday, one day
I'm bout to get it, bout to get, get, get it
Can't do it little cause i'm big, big Willy
I'm bout to do it just like DJ spit it 
Cause i was born, i was born to kill it
Get in my dollars, get, get in my dollars
I need it bigger i'm too big for smiler
I keep on working like i'm blue collar
Im bout to get it, baby, inshallah
Someday I'm gonna get it right my life
Someday I'm gonna figure it out maybe tonight
'Cause i know imma get it right
And i know imma get it right
Someday, one day
Someday, one day
[Taboo]
Breath, just breath
Now breath...
Drop it
[apl.de.ap]
I came here from the Philippines
In the plain with some big, big dreams
I left everything i knew behind me
Like my mom and my family
People tell me that i ain't gonna make it
I gotta finger in my all of them haters
In the minute ya'll go castivate cause
Cause in the minute imma get my paper
[will.i.am]
Someday I'm gonna get it right my life
Someday I'm gonna figure it out maybe tonight
'Cause i know imma get it right
And i know imma get it right
Someday, one day
Someday, one day
[Taboo]
Someday you're wondering if you're really gonna make it
Sometimes you wanna know if there's anyone to save ya
I know you came down before, like cannot leave the ground
Still got a little chance to turn it all around
Is no your time to come for give it all you got
Don't stop believin for give it all you got
Got, got, got, got...
