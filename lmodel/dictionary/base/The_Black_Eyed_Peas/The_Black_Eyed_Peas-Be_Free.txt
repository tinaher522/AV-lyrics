<song artist="The_Black_Eyed_Peas" title="Be_Free">
B.E.P. I know you feel it, huh. [x4]
Oh my goodness, I know you feel the vibration
Across the globe no matter your location
Ain't no difficulty or complication
Just as long as my niggas in the celebration
Celebrated the musical liberation
The peas then demonstrated the demonstration
&amp; you will feel the flush of relaxation
I'm a wax these &amp; then get heavy rotation
I got you in bliss &amp; ain't no aggrevation
When you bump us, we bring the stimulation
So hurry up &amp; get your daily fixation
But make sure that it's handled, it's a moderation
One dose should bring you to a limitation
So put your back into it, baby, that's right, huh
I'm about to plug in some dedication
This goes out to my brothers &amp; my coalition.
Chorus:
All I want is to Be Free
You keep pushin' up on me
All I want is to Be Free
You be you let I'll be me
Let me do what I feel inside
Won't get taken for a ride
Do just what I feel inside
Everything will be alright.
Everything will be alright.
Everything will be alright.
Everything will be alright.
Everything will be alright.
Oh my goodness, it's obvious now you feelin' me
Envious niggas plan on hurtin' me
Frontin' on my niggas &amp; also my family
Fienin for my capability, it's tragedy
My technicalities die hard like battery
Try to cross us, I blast 'cause you flattin' me
You oughta be on something like PCP
To come against a crew like B.E.P.
Oh my goodness
Oh no you didn't try to contest me
Come out delivery, won't control your body
I'm breakin' down y'all mathematically
Yes mentally, physically &amp; spiritually
Actually, I'm rippin' your anatomy
'cause literally you be in the cemetery
I'm about to throw a shout-out to my peeps
Dedicated to the D.J.'s that pump it in their streets.
Chorus:
All I want is to Be Free
You keep pushin' up on me
All I want is to Be Free
You be you let I'll be me
Let me do what I feel inside
Won't get taken for a ride
Do just what I feel inside
Everything will be alright.
Everything will be alright.
Everything will be alright.
Everything will be alright.
Everything will be alright.
Whip it good like devoe we whip it good
You understand 
Yo man, it's understood
We be winnin' tournaments like tigerwoods
Openin your suburbs &amp; bump it in your hood
Rock it in your box or your hooptie-hoop
Bump it in your hot beamer 850 coupe
'cause I'm a inform y'all on what to do
Hop in your ride &amp; drive down in your avenue
It's bumpin in your barbeque &amp; your venue
At a journey, feelin' that ease, is why I sent you
'cause ain't no stoppin' this, stoppin it
'cause we be rockin' it 
Rock, rock, rock.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. [x8]
Chorus:
All I want is to Be Free
You keep pushin' up on me
All I want is to Be Free
You be you let I'll be me
Let me do what I feel inside
Won't get taken for a ride
Do just what I feel inside
Everything will be alright.
Everything will be alright.
Everything will be alright.
Everything will be alright.
Everything will be alright.
Gather up the team, now we ready to go
Any minute we'll be all over your box &amp; video
Niggas wanna stop me &amp; my amigos
But we still roll all over your accapella goes
Leave it or this one here like meteor
Your mediocre scene, you feel the roar
Vibration that's headed for your store
For a change, not bragging about close to more
Instead brain fusion, I lace you up confusion
Relax &amp; feel the groove it's the solution
We straight cruisin' while the beat is still cruisin'
Your here so clap your hand to what we're doin'.
Chorus:
All I want is to Be Free
You keep pushin' up on me
All I want is to Be Free
You be you let I'll be me
Let me do what I feel inside
Won't get taken for a ride
Do just what I feel inside
Everything will be alright.
Everything will be alright.
Everything will be alright.
Everything will be alright.
Everything will be alright.
Whip it good.
