(Fergie)
Party all the time...
Party all the time...
Party all the time...
Party all the time...
(will.i.am)
If-if-if we could party all night
And sleep all day
And throw all of my problems away
My life would be easy
My life would be easy
I would drink and go out-out
With my boo
Party-party all the time
Yep, that's what I'd do
Mack models, pop bottles
Live life like the Sheik (Party)
Monday through Sunday
Every day of the week
(will.i.am &amp; Fergie)
High octane life
In the fast lane zoom
And the joint don't pop
'Til I walk in the room
And the DJ's rockin' my favorite tune
And they're shakin' up the speaker like
Boom Boom Boom
If we could party all night
And sleep all day
And throw all of my problems away
My life would be easy
My life would be easy
If we could party all night
And sleep all day
And throw all of my problems away-ay-ay
It would be easy
Our lives would be easy
(Fergie)
If we could...
Party all the time...
Party all the time...
Party all the time...
Party all the time...
Party all the time...
Party all the time...
Party all the time...
(Taboo)
If-if-if we could...
Party party party (Hey!)
Break-break that body down (Yo!)
Ladies don't stop it (No!)
Shake it 'round and 'round
Feel that bass bumpin'
And rock to the beat
This beat is steady bumpin'
They jumpin' off their feet
Check it out...
Ladies got their hands in the air
Freakin' like they just don't care (Uh-huh!)
Party on down like yeah! (Yeah)
Somebody say "Yeah!" (Yeah!)
Check it out
Check it out
What?
Check it out
Check it out
Check it out
What?
No you...check...it...out
I'm gonna party on like there's no turnin' back
Whatcha gonna do?
(Fergie)
Party all night
And sleep all day
And throw all of my problems away
My life would be easy
(Oh yeah!)
Our lives would be easy
(will.i.am &amp; Fergie)
If we could party all night
And sleep all day
And throw all of my problems away
My life would be easy
My life would be easy
(apl.de.ap)
I don't give a fuck
I'm about to get loose
I'm a take take take take shots
Get drunk off Goose
I'm a live my fuck... l-l-l-l-life
I'm a party all night, all day, any time
I don't c-care if it's right
I wanna party, party, party (Hey!)
Party all day (Okay)
Par-p-p-p-p-party, party (Party)
Party all the way
(will.i.am &amp; Fergie)
I wanna party like Ibiza
We don't need no visa
Party like the Peas-a
I don't need one either
(Fergie)
Take me to the club
I need to dance, I need to dance, I need to dance
How 'bout a dance?
(will.i.am)
Girl, I'm gonna take you to the club
So we can dance, so we can dance
So we can dance...the dance
So we can dance...the dance
(will.i.am &amp; Fergie)
If we could party all night
And sleep all day
And throw all of my problems away
My life would be easy
My life would be easy
If we could party all night
And sleep all day
And throw all of my problems away
My life would be easy
My life would be easy
(Fergie)
Party all the time...
Party all the time...
Party all the time...
Party all the time...
Party all the time...
Party all the time...
Party all the time...
I'm so tipsy...
So tipsy...
Yeah, I said it...I'm so tipsy...
Yeah, I said it....
