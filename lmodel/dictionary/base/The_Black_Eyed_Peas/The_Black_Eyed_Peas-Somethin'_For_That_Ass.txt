What the hell y'all came here for
If y'all ain't out there on that floor
You asked me to bring it
so I brought a little more
Give it to ya raw,

Lock the terminator gonna keep this pure
Just for y'all, for y'all pleasure (your pleasure, pleasure)
Smoking hot like bim cigars
This goes out to my neighbor's
Hey ladies lets get down
Spin your partners round and round (round and round and round)
wait on your back and dosedo (se do)
don't say nothin' if you dosedoed ( oh oh)

Let's scream and shout (oooooooooh)
And turn this jamboree-out (oooooooooh)
That's just what we're gonna do
'cause I brought a little somethingthat's made for you. (for you)
I got sumthin for that ass (I got sumthin for that ass)
You can feel it in the club (you can feel it in the club)
I just want to see you dance (I just want to see you dance)
Now's the time for y'all to move (yeah, come on keep movin')
Let's keep this shit moving (keep on moving)
Get on down and put the groove in (groove, groove)
This party ain't never gonna end
since coz when it stop we're gonna start again (start again)
The ratio is five to ten
coz the men's outside and they can't get in
Damn that's so spectacular
to see so much damn ass in here (here, here)
Hey ladies lets get down (lets get down)
Move them fella's round and round

Oooooooooh (ladies and gentlemen report to the dancefloor)
Oooooooooh (everybody report to the dancefloor)
Oooooooooh (report to the dancefloor)
Ooh ooh oooooooooh
(come on)
What the hell are you playin' for?
Care to show shorty just rockin' it more
I started out just rocking their floors
But now I'm oversea's rocking european tours
Mostly I'm dedicated to the city of L.A.
Open up the circle and rockin' in the bay
Take it down to London and rock the same way
down under to Perth and back to Sydney
We rock the earth,
'cause we don't play
we do it like this
the Black Eyed Pea way (Pea way)
Do as we do, do what we say say, (say say)
Get on the floor and shake your thang thang (thang thang)
Do dat, do dat, do dat, do dat (oow)
Do dat, do dat, do dat, do dat (oow)
Do dat, do dat, do dat, do dat (oow)
Do dat, do dat, do dat, do dat,(oow) do dat, do dat 
I got somthin' for that ass (I got somthin' for that ass)
You can feel it in the club (you can feel it in the club)
I just wanna see you dance (I just wanna see you dance)
Now's the time for y'all to move (so come on keep movin')
I got somthin' for that ass (I got somthin' for that ass)
You can feel it in the club (You can feel it in the club)
I just wanna see you dance (I just wanna see you dance)
Nows the time for y'all to move (so come on keep movin')
Move (So come on keep movin')
Move (So come on keep movin')
Move (So come on keep movin')
Move (So come on keep movin')
