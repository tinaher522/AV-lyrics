<song artist="The_Black_Eyed_Peas" title="Sumthin'_For_That_Ass">
Everybody report the the dancefloor!
Report to the dancefloor!
Oh, oh, oh, oh (come on)
Oh, oh, oh, o-o-oh
What the hell y'all came here for
If y'all ain't out there on that floor
Ya ask me to bring it so I brought a little more
I give it to ya raw give it to ya hardcore
Y'all contaminate it, I'm a keep this pure
Just for your, for your, for your
Smoking hot like them cigars
This goes out to my neighbors
Hey ladies, let's get down
Spin your partners round and round
Break your back and doe-si-doe
Don't say nothing if you don't see dough
Let's scream and shout
And turn this jamboree out
And that's just what we gon' do
Cos I brought a little something that's came for you
I got something for that ass (I got something for that ass)
You could feel it in the club (you could feel it in the club)
I just wanna see ya dance (I just wanna see ya dance)
Now's the time for y'all to move (come on, keep movin)
Let's keep this shit moving
Get on down and put the groove in
This party ain't never gon' end
Cos right when it stop we gon' start it again
The way she always by the ten
Cos the man's outside and they can't get in
Damn that's so spectacular
To see so much damn ass in here
Hey ladies, let's get down
Move them bellies round and round
Wiggle them hips and do-cee-do
Don't say nothing if you don't see doe
Let's scream and shout
If you up against the wall get the hell on out
It's N-O, T-O, R-I, O
U-S, you just follow your soul and dance
I got something for that ass (I got something for that ass)
You could feel it in the club (you could feel it in the club)
I just wanna see ya dance (I just wanna see ya dance)
Now's the time for y'all to move (come on, keep movin)
Keep movin, movin
Keep your asses movin
Keep your body movin
Keep movin, movin
Oh, oh, oh, o-o-oh
What the hell are you waiting for
Can the short shorty just rock it anymore
I started just rocking dancefloors
Now I'm overseas rocking European tours
Of course I'm dedicated to the city of L.A.
I open up a circle and rock it in the Bay
Take it down to London and rock the same way
Down under to Perth then back to Sydney
We rock the Earth cos we don't play
We do it like this the Black Eyed Pea way
Do as we do, do what we say-say
Get on the floor and shake your thang-thang
Do that, do that, do that, do that (ah)
Do that, do that, do that, do that (ah)
Do that, do that, do that, do that (ah)
Do that, do that, do that, do that (ah)
Do that, do that
I got something for that ass (I got something for that ass)
You could feel it in the club (you could feel it in the club)
I just wanna see ya dance (I just wanna see ya dance)
Now's the time for y'all to move (come on, keep movin)
Move (so come on, keep movin)
Move (so come on, keep movin)
Move (so come on, keep movin)
