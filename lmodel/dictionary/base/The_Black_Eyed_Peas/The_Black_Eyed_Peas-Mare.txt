Runway model, fashion show. 
In the club gettin' low, 
Lookin' like she's getting doh 
Why herself from head-to-toe, 
Oh no, she a pro-fessional, 
Lemme know what it takes to get close 
And mix like Halo-Halo.

Bilis na, dali na tayo, tayong dalawa, 
Sayaw ka, sunod ka, gusto kitang kasama. 
Kaibigan barkada, lahat magsamasama, 
Kahit nasaan ka, 
Madama mo sana 
Sayaw ka na, (Hey Hey) 
Ang ganda mong dalaga,

Gusto kitang kasama.
