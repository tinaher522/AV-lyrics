<song artist="The_Black_Eyed_Peas" title="Can_You_Feel_It">
Can you feel the hyeeyyyeeyype
[Chorus]
Can you feel it in ya body-ah [can you feel it]
Can you feel it in ya body-ah [can you feel it]
Coz I can feel it in my body-ah [I can feel it]
It feels good to my body-ah
To my body, in my body-ah [can you feel it]
Can you feel it in ya body-ah [can you feel it]
Coz I can feel it in my body-ah [I can feel it]
It feels good to my body-ah
We gonna make y?all feel it
Make y?all feel it
Make y?all wanna jam
Fellas in the place just clap your hands
Ladies in the house just grab a man
We gonna make y?all feel it
Make y?all feel it
Make y?all wanna move
Ladies in the place just show 'em proof
Fellas in the house you know what to do
We gonna make y?all feel it in a special way
An EVENT full of action and expose
Ladies in the CLUB looking ready to play
And I'm waiting for the right one to pass my way
And in the mean time I'm about to roll up The Hague
We got drinks on the table, time to parle,
And it's time to unwind if you've had a low day
And ladies, I got something to say
[Chorus]
We gonna make y?all feel it
Make y?all feel it
Make y?all wanna jam
Fellas in the place just clap your hands
Ladies in the house just grab a man
We gonna make y?all feel it
Make y?all feel it
Make y?all wanna move
Lades in the place just show 'em proof
Fellas in the house you know what to do
Feel the vibration of the bass charm,
Put your hand on the speaker, get your face blown
Get up on the floor, get your dance on
Coz your backbone's connected to your ass thong
The ladies all dressin up high fashion [hot!]
Dancing all sexy with passion
Honey, if you don't mind me askin', 
Can you feel all that bass in that ass, hun?
[Chorus]
This is it [this is it] gotta keep 'em moving
Don't stop [don't stop] once you get moving
Don't break [one break] next thing you know
You on top [you on top] so hop to the rhythm
That we rooocckk it [rock] get loose and express
What you got [what you got] at least you gotta 
Give yourself a shot [a shot] hey never get 'em up
And gimme what you got?
Can you feel the hy-y-y-ype?
I can feel the hy-y-y-ype
Can you feel the hy-y-y-ype?
I can feel the hy-y-y-ype
[Chorus]
To my body, to my body-ah
To my body, to my body-ah
