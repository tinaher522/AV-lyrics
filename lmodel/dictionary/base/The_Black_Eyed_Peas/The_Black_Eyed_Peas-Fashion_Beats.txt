<song artist="The_Black_Eyed_Peas" title="Fashion_Beats">
Hey doctor, is something wrong with me?
Am I crazy? Do I need a remedy?
I'm a club rocker, that's my personality
It's in fashion to be blasting them beats
And I like to go out every night
I like to go out every night
I like to go out every night
I like to go out and
Dance, dance to them beats, beats, beats (to the beat),
Dance, dance to them beats, beats, beats, (to the beat),
Dance, dance to them beats, beats, beats (to the beat).
Rock, rock to them beats, beats, beats (to the beat)
Get ready for the night, woah.
Party people just keep on rockin'
Get ready for the night, woah.
Party people just keep on rockin', rockin'
In fashion,
In fashion,
In fashion,
In fashion
Hey, yeah.
Hey, yeah.
Enchanté, comment allez-vous? 
Très bien, merci et vous?
Super good, super nice
Salt and pepper,
Sugar and spice 
Space sugar case to the moon, 
Let's go,
Coco, Chanel, Marilyn Monroe 
Catwalk, fashion show,
Runway, fashion show,
Tall man, radio 
G6, I don't know.
Get ready for the night, woah.
Party people just keep on rockin'
Get ready for the night, woah.
Party people just keep on rockin', rockin'
In fashion,
In fashion,
In fashion,
In fashion
Hey, yeah.
Hey, yeah.
Hey, yeah.
Hey, yeah.
Hey doctor, ain't nothing wrong with me
I ain't crazy, I don't need no remedy
I'm a club rocker, that's my personality
And it's in fashion to be blasting them beats
And I like to go out every night
I like to go out every night
I like to go out every night
I like to go out
Bonsoir, I'm going at night
Bonsoir, we're going at night
Bonsoir, we're going at night
Bonsoir, je me reveille?? 
Fashion, chic, sexy, freak
Fashion, chic, sexy, freak
In fashion,

To the beat,
To the beat,
To the beat
Rock, rock to them beats, beats, beats (to the beat)
Dance, dance to them beats, beats, beats (to the beat)
Dance, dance to them beats, beats, beats (to the beat)
Rock, rock to them beats, beats, beats,
Beats, beats, beats, beats, beats.
