<song artist="The_Black_Eyed_Peas" title="That's_The_Joint">
That's the joint
That's the joint, that's the joint
That's the joint, that's the joint
That's the joint
That's the joint
That's the jam
Play it again
I like the way the rhythm makes me jump and move
It gots the feelin' that makes me wanna do my do
Got me feelin' joy, turn my gray sky blue
And when you hear a cut, baby doll, I know you
Will feel it huh? Get up on the floor start movin' some
Body parts that got brothers actin' dumb
And they be actin' dumb
And they be actin' dumb from the cut that playin'
People break they neck from this demonstration
We about mass appeal, no segregation
Got Black to Asian and Caucasian sayin'
That's the joint
That's the joint
That's the jam
Play it again
That's the joint
That's the joint
That's the jam
Play it again
Let your body collide to the rhythm provided
By the mind state affairs classified
And make your heat up and flare, I swear
A serenade, a soul and so beware
And what's happenin' here, seek one to help you
Feelin' a piece of mind, let your spine unwind
Maybe in time you can stop this crime
But until then, yo I'm-a rock a rhyme sayin'
That's the joint
That's the joint
That's the jam
Play it again
That's the joint
That's the joint
That's the jam
Play it again
That's the joint
That's the joint
That's the joint
That's the joint
That's the joint
That's the joint
That's the joint
That's the joint
That's the joint
Got the state's appeal with the joint's that real
I don't need no steel to make my point
Get down and dirty 'cause that's my joint
Ha, ha, ha, that's my joint
Ha, ha, ha, that's my joint
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, that's my joint
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, that's my joint
We preferably make all points
Through a nation we build off the musical field
Or a visual thrill, we do what we feel
Any time or place, on stage in ya face
Over tea in Earth and outer space
Because we rock that s***, we flip that s***
Some east coast, west coast cosmic s***
Some north bound s***, some some south bound s***
Some overseas, London, out of town s***
Rockin' the joint, rockin' the jams
Turn that s*** up, play it again 'cause
That's the joint, that's the jam
Turn that s*** up
That's the joint
That's the joint
That's the jam
Play it again
That's the joint
That's the joint
That's the jam
Play it again
That's the joint
