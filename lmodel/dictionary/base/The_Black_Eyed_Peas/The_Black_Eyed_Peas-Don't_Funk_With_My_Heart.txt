No, no, no, no
Don't funk with my heart, yeah
No, no, no, no
Don't funk with my heart
I wonder if I take you home
Would you still be in love baby?
In love baby?
I wonder if I take you home
Would you still be in love baby?
In love baby?
Girl, you know you got me, got me
(Yeah)
With your pistol shot me, shot me
And I'm here helplessly
In love and nothing can stop me
It can't stop me once I started
Can't return me, once you bought it
I'm coming, baby, don't doubt it
(Don't make me wait)
So let's be about it
No, no, no, no
Don't funk with my heart
Baby, have some trustin', trustin'
When I come with lustin', lustin'
'Cause I bring you that comfort
I ain't only here 'cause I want your body
I want you're mind too
Interestin', what I find you
And I'm interested in the long haul
Come on girl, yee, haw
Come on
I wonder if I take you home
Would you still be in love baby?
In love baby?
I wonder if I take you home
Would you still be in love baby?
In love baby?
No, no, no, no
Don't funk with my heart
Girl, you had me once you kissed me
(Kiss)
My love for you is not iffy
I always want you wit me
I'll play Bobby and you play Whitney
(And I, I'm)
If you smoke, I smoke too
That's how much I'm in love witch you
Crazy is what crazy do
Crazy in love, I'm a crazy fool
No, no, no, no
Don't funk with my heart
Why you so insecure
When you got passion and love her?
You always claim that I'm a cheata
Think I'll up and go leave ya
For another Senorita
You forgot that I need ya
You must have caught amnesia
That's why you don't believe her
Well, yeah, check it out
Don't ya worry about a thing, baby
'Cause ya know ya got me by a string, baby
Don't ya worry about a thing, baby
'Cause ya know ya got me by a string, baby
Baby girl, ya make me feel
You know, you make me feel so real
I love you more than sex appeal
'Cause ya
That, that, that, that, that, that, that girl
That, that, that, that, that, that, that girl
That, that, that, that, that, that, that girl
That, that, that, that, that, that, that girl
That, that, that, that, that, that, that girl
That, that, that, that, that, that, that girl
No, no, no, no
(That, that, that, that, that, that, that girl)
Don't funk with my heart
(That, that, that, that, that, that, that girl)
No, no, no, no
Don't funk with my heart

Would you still be in love baby?

I wonder if I take you home
Would you still be in love baby?
In love baby?
I wonder if I take you home
Would you still be in love baby?
In love baby?
I wonder if I take you home
Would you still be in love baby?
In love baby?
Don't ya worry about a thing, baby
'Cause you know you got me by a string, baby
Don't ya worry about a thing, baby
'Cause you know you got me by a string, baby
