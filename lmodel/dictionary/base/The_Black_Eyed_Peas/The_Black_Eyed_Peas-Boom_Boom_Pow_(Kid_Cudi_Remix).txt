I got that hit that beat the block
You can get that bass overload
I got that rock and roll, that future flow
That digital spit next level visual ***
I got that boom, boom, boom
Gotta get, get boom, boom, boom
I like that boom, boom, pow
Them chickens jackin' my style
They try copy my swagger
I'm on that next *** now
I'm so 3008, you so 2000 and late
I got that boom, boom, boom
That future boom, boom, boom
Let me get it now

I'm on the supersonic boom
Y'all hear the spaceship zoom
When when I step inside the room
Them girls go ape ***
Y'all stuck on super 8 ***
That low-fi stupid 8 bit
I'm on that HD flat
This beat go boom, boom, bap
I'm a beast when you turn me on
Into the future cybertron
Harder, faster, better, stronger
Sexy ladies extra longer
We got the beat that bounce
We got the beat that pound
We got the beat that 808
That boom, boom in your town
People in the place if you wanna get down
Put your hands on the air
Will.i.am drop the beat now
Yup, yup
I be rockin' them beats, yup, yup
I be rockin' them beats yup, yup, yup, yup
Here we go, here we go satellite radio
Y'all gettin' hit with boom, boom
Beats so big I'm steppin' on leprechauns
