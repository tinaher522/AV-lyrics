I wanna go, I wanna go for a ride 
Hop in the music &amp; rock yo body right 
Rock that body, come on come on rock that body(Rock your body)
Rock that body, come on come on rock-that-body 
Rock that body, come on come on rock that body(Rock your body) 
Rock that body, come on come on rock-that-body
Let me see ya body rock 
Shakin from the bottom to the top 
Freak to what the Dj drop 
We be the one to make it hot (to make it hot) 
Electric shock, energy like a billion watts
Space be boomin, the speakers pop
Gollat the comb, we miss the spot 
We bumpin your parkin lot
When you comin up in the spot
Don't bring nothing we call pink dot
Cus we burnin around the clock
Hit the lights and then turn them off
If you bring that don't make you stop
Like the jungle we run the block
No one rollin the way we rock,
Way we rock
I wanna, I wanna rock right now 
I wanna, I wanna rock right now 
I wanna, I wanna rock right nooowww
I wanna da-
I wanna dance in the lights
I wanna ro- 
I wanna rock yo body 
I wanna go, I wanna go for a ride 
Hop in the music &amp; rock yo body right
Rock that body, come on come on rock that body(Rock your body)
Rock that body, come on come on rock-that-body
Rock that body, come on come on rock that body(Rock your body) 
Rock that body, come on come on rock-that-body
Supa fly ladies,
All of my Supa fly ladies,
All of my Supa fly ladies,
All of my Supa fl-
Supa fly ladies
Yeah you could big ballin 
Long as you feel like your own
Yeah you could be the model type, 
Skinny wit no appetite
Short, stacked, black or white, 
Long as you do what you like
Body outta sight, body, body outta sight
She does the two step and the tongue drop
She does the cabbage patch and the bus stop
She like electro, she love hip-hop, she like the rege
She feel punk rock, she love samba and the mambo
She like to break dance and calypso
Get a lil crazy, get a lil stupid
Get a lil crazy, crazy, crazy
I wanna da-
I wanna dance in the lights
I wanna ro- 
I wanna rock yo body 
I wanna go, I wanna go for a ride
Hop in the music &amp; rock yo body right
Rock yo body right
Rock yo body right
Come on, yeah
Rock that body, come on,come on rock that body
Come on
Rock that body, come on,come on rock-that-body

Now Go Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh 
Now Go Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh 
I want I wanna rock right now
I want I wanna rock-
I want I wanna rock-
Now Go Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh 
I want I wanna rock-
I want I wanna rock-
Now Go Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh
I wanna rock right now 
I wanna, I wanna rock right now 
I wanna, I wanna rock right now 
Now, now, rock right now 
Now Go Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh 
I wanna, I wanna rock right now 
I wanna, I wanna rock right now
I wanna, I wanna rock right nooowww
