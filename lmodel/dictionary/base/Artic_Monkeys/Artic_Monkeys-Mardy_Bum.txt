Well, now then Mardy Bum
I've seen your frown and it's like looking down the barrel of a gun
And it goes off
And out come all these words
Oh, there's a very pleasant side to you
A side I much prefer
One that's laughs and jokes around
Remember cuddles in the kitchen, yeah
To get things off the ground
And it was up, up and away
Aw, but it's right hard to remember that
On a day like today
When you're all argumentative
And you've got the face on
Well, now then, Mardy Bum
Oh, I'm in trouble again, aren't I?
I thought as much
'Cause you turned over there
Pulling that silent disappointment face
The one that I can't bear
Well, can't we just laugh and joke around?
Remember cuddles in the kitchen, yeah
To get things off the ground
And it was up, up and away
Oh, but it's right hard to remember that
On a day like today
When you're all argumentative
And you've got the face on
Yeah, I'm sorry I was late
But I missed the train
And then the traffic was a state
And I can't be arsed to carry on in this debate
That reoccurs, oh, when you say I don't care
But of course I do, yeah, I clearly do
So laugh and joke around
Remember cuddles in the kitchen, yeah
To get things off the ground
And it was up, up and away
Oh, but it's right hard to remember that
On a day like today
When you're all argumentative
And you've got the face on
