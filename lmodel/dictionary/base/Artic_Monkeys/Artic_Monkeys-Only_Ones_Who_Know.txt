In a foreign place, the saving grace was the feeling
That it was her heart that he was stealing
Oh, he was ready to impress and the fierce excitement
The eyes are bright, he couldn't wait to get away
And I bet that Juliet was just the icing on the cake
Make no mistake, no
And even if somehow he could have shown you the place you wanted
Well, I'm sure you could have made it that bit better on your own
And I bet she told a million people that she'd stay in touch
But all the little promises, that don't mean much
When there's memories to be made
And I hope you're holding hands by New Year's Eve
They made it far too easy to believe
That true romance can't be achieved these days
And even if somehow they could have shown you the place you wanted
Well, I'm sure you could have made it that bit better on your own
You are the only ones who know
