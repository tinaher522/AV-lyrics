<song artist="Artic_Monkeys" title="Pretty_Visitors">
Trudging through the morning and the tramp with the trampoline under his arm
Shifts past your whiskers
So stark is a charm, but the barking alarm waits coiled till the corner is turned
And the bicycle wheels all struggle to move round in your muddy mind
Blatantly caked and unwilling to wind uncooperative time
So he sits on the springs till the muck goes dry
All the pretty visitors came and waved their arms
And cast the shadow of a snake pit on the wall
All the pretty visitors came and waved their arms
And cast the shadow of a snake pit on the
What came first? The chicken or the dickhead?
Split sleep reeps rewards from ill-fitting thoughts
And twilight forced you to go on a walk
Your legs start running and your head gets caught
Canopy 19 is perfectly placed for the reasonably frightening
Fall from the aftertaste
You'll have to slip away, I'm unhappy to say
Behold, there's a crook in the hammock, plays
(All the pretty visitors came and waved their arms)
(And cast the shadow of a snake pit on the wall)
All the pretty visitors came and waved their arms
And cast the shadow of a snake pit (on the wall) on the wall
Behold, there's a crook in the hammock, plays
Cruelly with the base and the scales
And fiddles with the feet on a balancing act
Gagged, bound and crafting a tale
Trailing, wrapped in a gasp
Cruelly with the base and the scales
And fucking fiddles with the feet on a balancing act
She was gagged, bound and crafting a tale
Trailing, wrapped in a gasp
All the pretty visitors came and waved their arms
And cast the shadow of a snake pit on the wall
All the pretty visitors came and waved their arms
And cast the shadow of a snake pit on the wall
