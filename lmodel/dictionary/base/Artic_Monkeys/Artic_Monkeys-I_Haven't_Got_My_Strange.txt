<song artist="Artic_Monkeys" title="I_Haven't_Got_My_Strange">
When I got back from fixing my hair
You were directing the traffic
Letting your story slip on the snow
As if the transmission was automatic
It's arguable that I shouldn't have been there
It was fortunate timing
I had a hole in the pocket of my favourite coat
And my love dropped into the lining
(Have you got your strange?)
Not on me
I haven't got my strange
(Have you got your strange?)
Not on me
You can't sleep till you've sat on the steps
To weep till you feel like you've wept, yeah
(As long as you don't forget your strange)
(Have you got your strange?)
No, not on me
I haven't got my strange
(Have you got your strange?)
Oh, not on me
I haven't got my strange
I've better fetch my strange
I haven't got my strange
