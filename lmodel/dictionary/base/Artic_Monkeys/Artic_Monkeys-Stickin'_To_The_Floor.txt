<song artist="Artic_Monkeys" title="Stickin'_To_The_Floor">
Won't somebody let me out?
Don't wanna stick around no more
I said they're looking at yer strange
I'm sick of stickin' to the floor
Not one of you's got an ounce of style in ya
So now one of you
Fucking hell I'll break your nose
If they keep on pushing you around
Keep on stepping on your toes
And pick you up when you fall down
Not one of you's got an ounce of style in ya
Said not one of you, no
Not one of you's got an ounce of style in ya
Said not one of you, no
