Brian
Top marks for not tryin'
So kind of you to bless us
With your effortlessness
We're grateful and so strangely comforted
And I wonder
Are you puttin' us under?
'Cause we can't take our eyes
Off the T-shirt and ties combination
Well, see you later, innovator
Some want to kiss, some want to kick you
There's not a net you couldn't slip through
Or at least that's the impression I get
'Cause you're smooth and you're wet
And she's not aware yet but she's yours
She'll be sayin', "Use me
Show me the jacuzzi"
I imagine that it's there on a plate
Your whole rendezvous rate means that
You'll never be frightened to make them wait
For a while
I doubt it's your style
Not to get what you set out to acquire
The eyes are on fire
You are the unforecasted storm
(Brian)
Calm, collected and commanding
(Top marks for not tryin')
You leave the other stories standin'
With your renditions and jokes
Bet there's hundreds of blokes
That have wept 'cause you've stolen their
Thunder
Are you puttin' us under?
'Cause we can't take our eyes
Off the T-shirts and ties combination
Well, see you later, innovator
