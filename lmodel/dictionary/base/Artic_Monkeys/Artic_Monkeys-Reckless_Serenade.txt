<song artist="Artic_Monkeys" title="Reckless_Serenade">
Topless models doing semaphore
Wave their flags as she walks by and get ignored
Illuminations on a rainy day
When she walks her footsteps sing a reckless serenade
I've been trying to figure out
Exactly what it is I need
Called up to listen to the voice of reason
And got the answering machine
The type of kisses where teeth collide
When she laughs, the heavens hum a stun gun lullaby
Those twinkling vixens with their shining spiral eyes
Their hypnosis goes unnoticed when she's walking by
I've been trying to figure out
Exactly what it is I need
Called up to listen to the voice of reason
And got his answering machine
I left my message
But did he fuck get back to me
Now I'm stuck, still wondering
How it's meant to be
Singing a reckless serenade, reckless serenade
Reckless serenade, reckless serenade
Reckless serenade, reckless serenade
Reckless serenade
