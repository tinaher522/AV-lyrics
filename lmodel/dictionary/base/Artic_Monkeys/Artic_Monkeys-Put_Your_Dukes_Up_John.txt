<song artist="Artic_Monkeys" title="Put_Your_Dukes_Up_John">
Just put your Dukes up John
Yeah, put your dukes up John
You were preened and sanitized
Struck dumb by good advice
Your integrity was bruised
Your celebrity a ruse
They pulled the rug from under
Made way for new pretenders
Put your Dukes up, John
(Change your tune and change your hair)
Put your Dukes up, John
(Or you're not going anywhere)
Put your Dukes up, John
(Change your tune and change your hair)
Put your Dukes up, John
(Or you're not going anywhere)
And be a C-Y-N-I-C
Be a C-Y-N-I-C
The profit margin blinds them
They groomed and ostracised him
His calm makes my blood boil
His calm makes my blood boil
Put your Dukes up, John
(Change your tune and change your hair)
Put your Dukes up, John
(Or you're not going anywhere)
Put your Dukes up, John
(Change your tune and change your hair)
Put your Dukes up, John
(Or you're not going anywhere)
And be a C-Y-N-I-C
Be a C-Y-N-I-C
Change your tune and change your hair
Or your not going anywhere
Change your tune and change your hair
Or your not going anywhere
Change your tune and change your hair
Or your not going anywhere
Change your tune and change your hair
Or your not going anywhere
Put your Dukes up, John
(Change your tune and change your hair)
Put your Dukes up, John
(Or you're not going anywhere)
Put your Dukes up, John
(Change your tune and change your hair)
Put your Dukes up, John
(Or you're not going anywhere)
And be a C-Y-N-I-C
(Change your tune and change your hair)
And be a C-Y-N-I-C
(Or you're not going anywhere)
And be a C-Y-N-I-C
(Change your tune and change your hair)
And be a C-Y-N-I-C
(Or you're not going anywhere)
