<song artist="Artic_Monkeys" title="Leave_Before_The_Lights_Come_On">
Well, this is a good idea
You wouldn't do it if it wasn't
You wouldn't do it if it wasn't one
Well, my friend fancies you
Oh, what a way to begin it all
You said there're always exciting words to hear
And you woke up together not quite realizing how
Oh, but you're stretching and yawning
It's always hard in the morning
And I suppose that's the price you pay
Well, oh, it isn't what it was
She's thinking he looks different today
And now there's nothing left to guess now
You left before the lights came on
Because you didn't want to ruin
What it was that was brewing
Before they absolutely had turn
But how can you wake up
With someone you don't love
And not feel slightly fazed by it?
Oh, he had a struggle
And he woke up together not quite realising how
Oh, but he's stretching and yawning
It's always hard in the morning
And I suppose that's the price you pay
Well, oh, it isn't what it was
She's thinking he looks different today
And now there's nothing left to guess now
Quick, let's leave before the lights come on
'Cause then you don't have to see
'Cause then you don't have to see
What you've done
Quick, let's leave before the lights come on
'Cause then you don't have to see
'Cause then you don't have to see
What you've done
I'll walk you up, what time's the bus come?
I'll walk you up, what time's the bus come?
I'll walk you up, what time's the bus come?
I'll walk you up, what time's the bus come?
