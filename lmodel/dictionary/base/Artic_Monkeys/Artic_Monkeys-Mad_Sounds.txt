<song artist="Artic_Monkeys" title="Mad_Sounds">
Mad sounds in your ears
Make you feel alright
They bring you back to life
Mad sounds in your ears
They make you get up and dance
They make you get up
Yeah, they make you get up
Love buckles under the strain
Of those wild nights
Run but you cannot hide
Mad sounds in your ears
They make you get up and dance
Yeah, they make you get up
All night long they reappear
They make you get up and dance
Yeah, they make you get up
Suppose you've got to do what you got to do

But you just can't figure out what went wrong

Oo, la la-la, oo
Oo, la la-la, oo, la la-la
Oo, la la-la, oo
(Oo, la la-la, oo, la la-la) you got those mad sounds in your ears
(Oo, la la-la, oo) to make you get up and dance
(Oo, la la-la, oo, la la-la) mad sounds in your ears
(Oo, la la-la, oo) they make you get up and dance
(Oo, la la-la, oo, la la-la) well, don't they make you get up?
(Oo, la la-la, oo) oh, yeah, they make you get up
(Oo, la la-la, oo, la la-la)
(Oo, la la-la, oo)
