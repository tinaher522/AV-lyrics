<song artist="Artic_Monkeys" title="If_You_Were_There,_Beware">
If you were there, beware
The serpent soul pinches
Three hundred and fifty no-thank-you's
And nobody flinches
Go on, girl, go on
Give us something gruesome
We require your grief
The thugs help the thieves
As they're trying to rob
The words from her gob
And take the swords
To the innocents
And if you were there, beware
The serpent soul pinches
Can't you sense she was never meant
To fill column inches?
And you had enough
What you're trying to dig up
Isn't there to be dug
The thieves help the thugs
As they're trying to beat
The good grace of her sweetheart
Out to the point
She'll comply
And why? Leave her on her own
If I'd have known, then I wouldn't have said it
I wouldn't have said it if I would have known
Why? Leave her on her own
If I predicted tears then I wouldn't have said it
I wouldn't have said it if I would have known
There's a circle of witches
Ambitiously vicious they are
And our attempts to remind them of reason
Won't get us that far
And I don't know what it is that they want
I don't know what it is that they want
But I haven't got it to give
But she hasn't got it to give
