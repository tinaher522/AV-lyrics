One look sends it coursing through the veins, oh, how the feeling races
Back up to their brains to form expressions on their stupid faces
They don't want to say hello like I want to say hello
Well, my heartbeat's at its peak when you're coming up to speak
And, oh, I'm so tense, never tenser
Could all go a bit Frank Spencer
And I'm talking gibberish
Tip of the tongue but I can't deliver it
Properly
Oh, it's all getting on top of me
And if it weren't this dark
You'd see how red my face has gone, yeah
Everybody's trying to crack the jokes and that to make you smile
Those that claim that they're not showing off are drowning in denial
But they're not half as bad as me, say anything and I'll agree
'Cause when it comes to acting up, I'm sure I could write the book
And now that you're more than a part in the play
It's slightly easier to think what to say
You had us all standing on our heads
Doing our best tricks, yeah
Never again, never again, no
Will there be another one quite as desirable as you
One look sends it coursing through the veins, oh, how the feeling races
Back up to their brains to form expressions on their stupid faces
