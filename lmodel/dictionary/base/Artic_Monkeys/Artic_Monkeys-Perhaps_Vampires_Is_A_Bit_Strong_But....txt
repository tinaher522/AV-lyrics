I've seen your eyes as they fix on me
What is he doing? What on earth's the plan? Has he got one?
You'd better give me some pointers
Since you are the big rocket launcher and I'm just the shotgun
Well, I ain't got no dollar signs in my eyes
That might be a surprise but it's true
So I'm not like you and I don't want your advice or your praise
Or to move in the ways you do and I never will
'Cause all you people are vampires
And all your stories are stale
And though you pretend to stand by us
I know you're certain we'll fail
Well, I've seen your eyes as they fix on me
Full of confusion, your snarl is just so condescending
Try to explain that we're onto a win
If the feel we get in near recoups what we're spending
He says, "I can't believe that you drove all that way"
Well, how much did they pay you? How much did they pay you?
You'd have been better to stay 'round our way
Thinking 'bout things but not actually doing the things
'Cause all you people are vampires
And all your stories are stale
And though you pretend to stand by us
I know you're certain we'll fail
'Cause all you people are vampires
And all your stories are stale
And though you pretend to stand by us
I know you're certain we'll fail
All you people are vampires
