<song artist="Artic_Monkeys" title="Teddy_Picker">
They've sped up to the point where they provoke
The punchline before they have told the joke
Plenty of desperation to be seen
Staring at the television screen
They've sped up to the point where they provoke
You to tell the fucking punchline before you have told the joke
Sorry, sunshine, it doesn't exist
It wasn't in the top 100 list
And it's the thousandth time and it's even bolder
Don't be surprised when you get bent over
They told ya, but you were dyin' for it
Saw it and she grabbed it
And it wasn't what it seemed
The kids all dream of making it
Whatever that means
Another variation on a theme
A tangle on the television and the magazine
D'you reckon that they do it for a joke?
D'you reckon that they make 'em take an oath?
That says that "We are defenders
Of any poser or professional
pretender around"'
When did your list replace the twist and turn
And the fist replace the kiss?
Don't concern us with your bollocks
I don't want your prayers
Save it for the morning after
And it's the thousandth time that it's even bolder
Don't be surprised when you get bent over
They told ya but you were gagging for it
Let's have a game on the Teddy Picker
Not quick enough, can I have it quicker?
Already thick and you're gettin' thicker
Let's have a game on the Teddy Picker
Not quick enough, can I have it quicker?
Already thick and you're gettin' thicker
Presuming that all things are equal
Who'd want to be man of the people
When there's people like you?
