<song artist="Artic_Monkeys" title="Who_The_Fuck_Are_Arctic_Monkeys?">
We all want someone to shout for
Yeah, everyone wants somebody to adore
But your heroes aren't what they seem
When you've been where we've been
Have I done something to trigger
Your funny looks and the sniggers?
Are they there at all
Or is it just paranoia?
Everybody's got their box
And doing what they're told
You pushed my faith near being lost
But we'll stick to the guns
Don't care if it's marketing suicide
We won't crack or compromise
Your derisory devides will never unhinge us
And there's a couple of hundred
Think they're Christopher Columbus
But the settlers had already settled
Yeah, long before ya
Just 'cause we're having a say-so
Not lining up to be Play-Doh
Oh, in five years time, will it be
"Who the fuck's Arctic Monkeys?"
'Cause everybody's got their box
And doing what they're told
You pushed my faith near being lost
But we'll stick to the guns
Don't care if it's marketing suicide
We won't crack or compromise
Your derisory devides will never unhinge us
All the thoughts that I just said
Will linger 'round and multiply in their head
Not that bad to start with
I'm not angry, I'm just disappointed
It's not you, it's them that are wrong
Tell 'em to take out their tongues
Tell 'em to take out their tongues
It's not you, it's them that are wrong
Tell 'em to take out their tongues
Tell 'em to take out their tongues
And bring on the backlash
It's not you, it's them that are wrong
Tell him to take out his tongue
Tell him to take out his tongue
It's not you, it's them that's the fake
I won't mess with your escape
Is this really your escape?
Yeah
