<song artist="Artic_Monkeys" title="Cigarette_Smoke">
Get out the way, mister 
With your short sharp tips 
No, I won't read your lips right now 
And baby, hey 
You send a shiver down my spine 
But do you read my mind 
Do you... 
And you're looking pretty suspicious 
And probably planning a heist 
He's wanting to go to the strippers 
It makes him feel all nice 
(Cigarette smoke yeah) 
The cigarette smoke in your eyes 
Watching a stripper and 
(Smacking a bloke yeah) 
Smacking a bloke here tonight 
Get out the way, mister 
With your short sharp tips 
No, I won't read your lips right now 
And baby, hey 
You send a shiver down my spine 
But do you read my mind 
Do you... 
He's prob'ly got stopped by a panda 
For speeding on his way there 
Formal flashing of digital cameras 
From tourists in Trafalgar Square 
(Cigarette smoke yeah) 
The cigarette smoke in your eyes 
Watching a stripper and 
(Snortin' some coke yeah) 
Snortin' some coke off her thighs 
Bla-bla-bla-bla-bla-bla... 
(Cigarette smoke yeah) 
The cigarette smoke in your eyes 
Watching a stripper and 
(Smacking a bloke yeah) 
Smacking a bloke here tonight 
And I just can't see for the 
(Cigarette smoke yeah) 
The cigarette smoke in your eyes 
Watching a stripper and 
(Snortin' some coke yeah) 
Snortin' some coke off her thighs 
Lalalalalala laaaaaaaoooo 
Oww
