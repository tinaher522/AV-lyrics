<song artist="Artic_Monkeys" title="Library_Pictures">
I'm in a vest
Library pictures of the quickening canoe
The first of its kind to get to the moon
Trust some ellipses to chase you 'round the room
Through curly straws and metaphors and goo
Been watching all the neon blossom flickering
And you look as if you've all forgotten where you've been
Going riding through the thundersuckle fuzz canyon
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
Library pictures of the quickening canoe
The first of its kind to get to the moon
Give me an eeny, meeny, miny, moe
Or an ip dip, dog shit, rock and roll
