<song artist="Artic_Monkeys" title="D_Is_For_Dangerous">
He knew what he wanted to say
But he didn't know how to word it
The dirty little Herbert
Was seeking an escape
But the place was well guarded
The guiltiness that started
Soon as the other part had stopped
D is for delightful
And try and keep your trousers on
I think you should know
You're his favourite worst nightmare
D is for desperately trying to simulate
What it was that was alright
Three quarters of an hour ago
That had led him to be in a position
And every copper mission
On every other episode
He's nearing the brink but he thinks first
The parallel universe perhaps could be the perfect scene
He's nearing the brink but he thinks first
The parallel universe perhaps could be the perfect scene
He's nearing the brink but he thinks first
The parallel universe perhaps could be the perfect scene
He's nearing the brink but he thinks first
The parallel, I think you should know you're his favourite worst nightmare
D is for Delightful
And try and keep your trousers on
You should know
You're his favourite worst nightmare
