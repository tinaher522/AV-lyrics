<song artist="Artic_Monkeys" title="Dangerous_Animals">
(Pinned down by the dark)
Been fighting with my sheets
And nearly crying in my sleep
Yes, I'm battling that well told gripe, the most frustrating type
You should have racing stripes
The way you keep me in pursuit
You sharpen the heel of your boot
And you press it to my chest and you make me wheeze
Then to my knees you do promote me
I'm pinned down by the dark
A-N-I-M-A-L
Makes my head pirouette
More than I would be willing to confess
D-A-N-G-E-R-O-U-S
The light, it fidgets through
The thoughts will soon revert to you
About as bashful as a tribal dance, the first and final chance
And of course the audience
Of frighteners and fiends
Divided up into two teams
When the acrobat fell off the beam
She broke everyone's heart
I'm pinned down by the dark
A-N-I-M-A-L
Makes my head pirouette
More than i would be willing to confess
D-A-N-G-E-R-O-U-S
D-A-N-G-E-R-O-U-S
The most unsuitable pet
It's been long enough now, so let's
Make a mess, lioness
I'm pinned down by the dark
I'm pinned down by the dark, oh
D-A-N-G-E-R-O-U-S
A-N-I-M-A-L
D-A-N-G-E-R-O-U-S
A-N-I-M-A-L
