<song artist="Artic_Monkeys" title="Stop_The_World_I_Wanna_Get_Off_With_You">
Open Sesame (we've places to go)
We've people to see (let's put 'em on hold)
There's all sorts of shapes that I bet you can make
When you had to escape, say the word
Well I know that getting you alone isn't easy to do
With the exception of you I dislike everyone in the room
And I don't wanna lie but I don't wanna tell you the truth
Get the sense that you're on the move
And you'll probably be leaving soon, so I'm telling you
 
Stop the world 'cause I wanna
Get off with you
Stop the world 'cause I wanna
Get off with you, ooh ooh ooh
Eyes the color of (water left in wood)
Icing sugar dust (crazy green flashes)
It's a funny thing that I cannot explain
Don't you know the train keeps rolling
 
Stop the world 'cause I wanna
Get off with you
Stop the world 'cause I wanna
Get off with you, ooh ooh ooh
 
Well, I know that getting you alone isn't easy to do
And I don't wanna lie and I don't wanna tell you the truth
And I know we got places to go, we got people to see
Think we both ought to put 'em on hold and I know you agree
 
Stop the world 'cause I wanna
Get off with you
Stop the world 'cause I wanna
Get off with you, ooh ooh ooh
