<song artist="Kodaline" title="What_It_Is">
So you're standing in the parking lot of life
And you're trying to figure out your fate tonight
And you hear a sound coming out of the car radio
Saying "son, if you don't learn, then you will never know"
So you try to drag your feet down to the bar
When you startin' to forget just who you are
And they told you it was written in the stars
But you've never had a chance to look that far
Yeah, it's just the way it goes
Maybe you die young before you're old
Yeah, it's just the way it is
Nobody's gonna tell you how to live
In a world that changes everyday,
It's easy to get lost along the way.
In a world that's never as it seems,
Where people try to buy and sell their dreams
Where people try to buy and sell their dreams
Yeah, it's just the way it goes.
Maybe you die young before you're old
Yeah, it's just the way it is.
Nobody's gonna tell you how to live.
Nobody's gonna tell you how to live.
(It's just the way it goes)
(Maybe you'll die young before you're old)
(Yeah, it's just the way it is)
(Nobody's gonna tell you how to live)
(Nobody's gonna tell you how to live)
Nobody's gonna tell you how to live.
Nobody's gonna tell you how to live.
Cause nobody understands just what it is
