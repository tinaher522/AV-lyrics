<song artist="Kodaline" title="Lost">
Take me away make it all better
If not for a day then maybe forever
Is it all in my head cause it’s getting harder
But there’s something you said that I never thought of
Cause we are ordinary people beautiful as we are
We can still get lost, lost
Lost
Lost
We are lost
We are lost
Maybe today it’ll get better
I hear what you say we’re in this together
Now I’m starting to see
Hoping and praying
We’ll never win, win without playing
Cause we are ordinary people beautiful as we are
We can still get lost, lost
Lost
We still get lost
It’s easy to get lost
We are lost
It’s easy to get lost
We are ordinary people, we are lost
Ordinary people
We are ordinary people, we are lost
Lost
Lost
