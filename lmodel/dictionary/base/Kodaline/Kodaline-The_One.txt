<song artist="Kodaline" title="The_One">
Tell me
Tell me that you want me
And I’ll be your completely 
For better or for worse
I know
We’ll have our disagreements
Be fighting for no reason
I wouldn’t change it for the world
‘Cause I know
The first day that I met you
I was never gonna let you
Let you slip away
And I
Still remember feeling nervous
Trying to find the words to
Get you here today
‘Cause you make my heart feel like it’s summer
When the rain is pouring down
You make my whole world feel so right when it’s wrong
That’s why I know you are the one
That’s how I know you are the one
In life
It’s easy to get scared oh
But with you I am prepared for
What has yet to come
‘Cause our two
Hearts will make it easy
Joining up the pieces
Together making life
‘Cause you make my heart feel like it’s summer
When the rain is pouring down
You make my whole world feel so right when it’s wrong
That’s why I know you are the one
That’s how I know you are the one
When we are together you make me feel like my mind is free and my dreams are reachable
Woah
You know I never ever believed in love, I believed one day you were gonna come along
Free me
‘Cause you make my heart feel like it’s summer
When the rain is pouring down
You make my whole world feel so right when it’s wrong
That’s why I know you are the one [x4]
