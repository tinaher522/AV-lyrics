<song artist="Kodaline" title="Better">
Am I wasting my time?
Am I losing my mind for better or for worse?
Cause it doesn’t feel right
No it doesn’t feel right
Does it make you feel better?
Cause it’s making me worse
Does it make you feel better?
Cause it’s making me hurt
Does it make you feel good?
When I’m falling apart?
Does it make you feel good?
And is it all in my head
Or was it something I said?
Somewhere in between
Cause I’ve got my regrets
And I’m feeling like death
You don’t see what I see
Does it make you feel better?
Cause it’s making me worse
Does it make you feel better?
Cause it’s making me hurt
Does it make you feel good?
When I’m falling apart?
Does it make you feel good? [x2]
