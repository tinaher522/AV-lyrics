<song artist="Kodaline" title="War">
There's a war between my head and my heart 
And I don't know which side to take
You made your home inside the dowry on my head
You know my heart was yours to break 
And people try and calm me down
But I can never hear a sound
Whoa-a-whoa-a-whoa 
Whoa-a-whoa-ooo-o
Yeah
There are sirens screaming out behind my eyes
I hide 'em away 'cause I'm ashamed 
Or maybe I'm just too shy to just speak up
Or I'm afraid of what you might say
And people try and calm me down (it can only get better) 
But I can never hear a sound (but you wish you never met her) 
Whoa-a-whoa-a-whoa 
Whoa-a-whoa-who
Yeah
Oh
Life 
It's just the way it is
Yeah 
Way it always was
And it's all right
Oh
Life 
It's just the way it is
Yeah. 
Way it always was
And it's all right
And people try and calm me down (it can only get better) 
But I can never hear a sound (but you wish you never met her) 
Whoa-a-whoa-a-whoa 
Whoa-a-whoa-a-whoa
Whoa-a-whoa-a-whoa
Whoa-a-whoa-ooo-o
And there's a war between my head and my heart
And I don't know which side to take
