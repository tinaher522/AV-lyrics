<song artist="Kodaline" title="Love_Will_Set_You_Free">
I’m sure you’re probably busy getting on with your new life
So far away from
So far away from
When everything we used to say was wrong is now alright
Where has the time gone
Where has the time gone
If you’re ever feeling lonely
If you’re ever feeling down
You should know you’re not the only one ‘cause I feel it with you now
When the world is on your shoulders and you’re falling to your knees
Oh please
You know love will set you free
I took a long and lonely walk up to an empty house
That’s where I’ve come from
Where have you come from
The more I live, the more I know, I’ve got to live without
This ain’t no sad song
Life has to go on
If you’re ever feeling lonely
If you’re ever feeling down
You should know you’re not the only one ‘cause I feel it with you now
When the world is on your shoulders and you’re falling to your knees
Oh please
You know love will set you free
Ooh
You know love will set you free [x6]
Love will set you free
Ooh
Love will set you free
If you’re ever feeling lonely
If you’re ever feeling down
You should know you’re not the only one ‘cause I feel it with you now
When the world is on your shoulders and you’re falling to your knees
Oh please
You know love will set you free
Love will set you free
