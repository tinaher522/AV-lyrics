<song artist="Kodaline" title="Human_Again">
I don’t even recognize when I look into your eyes,
All I can ever see, is trouble hanging over me. 
Trouble , trouble, trouble hanging over me. 
Trouble, trouble, trouble is all I ever see. 
I got a pain in my heart and a pain in my chest, I wanna be human again. 
I got a pain in my head, and I’m losing my breath, I wanna be human again.
Human Again, Human Again, Human Again, Human Again.
I wanna be human again. 
I can feel it in my bones, I don’t wanna die alone. 
When I all ever get is rain, help me see the sun again. 
I can see the change in me, makes me feel alive again. 
I got a pain in my heart and a pain in my chest, I wanna be human again. 
I got a pain in my head, and I’m losing my breath, I wanna be human again.
Human Again, Human Again, Human Again, Human Again.
I wanna be human again. 
Look, I am finally lucky I'm trying to find and I know there’s a light in the dark. 
Open your eyes to the beauty and settle your body, your soul and your heart. 
I wanna feel human, I wanna be human. 
Human again, what a beautiful feeling. 
Human again, I’m coming alive. 
Human again, I wanna be human, I wanna be human again
I got a pain in my heart and a pain in my chest, I wanna be human again
I got a pain in my head, and I’m losing my breath, I wanna be human again.
