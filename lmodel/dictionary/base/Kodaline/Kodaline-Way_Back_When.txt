<song artist="Kodaline" title="Way_Back_When">
We never had that much to do
So we just lay around in someone’s house
Someday I’ll have it all again
Just like way back when
Back then we’d sleep until the afternoon
And we’d just get up and go outside
Open a window, let the breeze blow in,
Forget everything
Yea, those will be the days that I'll be missing you
When I’m old and when I'm gray and when I stop working
I hope that I can say
When all my days are done
We were just having fun
Well we’d go drinking in the afternoon
Lie out on the grass and fall asleep
Oh will I ever see that girl again?
The girl from way back when
Yea, we used to share a cigarette
And throw together everything we had
And then go driving in my parents’ car
We never strayed too far
Yea, those will be the days that I'll be missing you
When I’m old and when I'm gray and when I stop working
I hope that I can say
When all my days are done
That I had my fun
Those will be the days that I had my fun
Yea, time it moves so fast
Some things are made to last
Here's to you, my dear old friend
From way back when
Yea, those will be the days that I'll be missing you
When I’m old and when I'm gray and when I stop working
I hope that I can say
When all my days are done
That I had my fun
