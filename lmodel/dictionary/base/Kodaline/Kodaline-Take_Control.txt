<song artist="Kodaline" title="Take_Control">
Take control of who you are
Stay the same don't let them change you
Take control of who you are
Cause ain't nobody going to save you
Take control of who you are
When the world is getting stranger
Take control of who you are
Stay the same don't let them change you
But when it comes apart
When it comes apart
Just start again and open up your heart
Take control of who you are
Take control of who you are
When you looking in the mirror
Underneath the skies you will see a little clearer
Take control of who you are
When the world is getting stranger
Take control of who you are
Show the people what you're made of
And when it comes apart
When it comes apart
Just start again and open up your heart
Take control of who you are
When it comes apart
When it comes apart
Just start again and open up your heart
Take control of who you are
When it comes apart
And when it comes apart
Just start again
Open up your heart
Take control of who you are
