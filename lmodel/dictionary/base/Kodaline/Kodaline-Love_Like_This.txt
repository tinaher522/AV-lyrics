<song artist="Kodaline" title="Love_Like_This">
Running through the heat, heartbeat,
You shine like silver in the sunlight
You light up my cold heart.
It feels right in the sun, the sun,
We're running around, and round
Like nothing else could matter in our lives.
But wait, but wait, but wait
The sun will stop shining soon
And you'll be gone from my life
Yeah you'll be gone,
It's as simple as a change of heart.
But I'm not gonna think about the future.
A love like this won't last forever
I know that a love like this won't last forever
But I, I don't really mind
I don't really mind at all
Slipping into the night love
It grows dark but you don't mind
Hiding in the backstreets
Yeah you never noticed me
All that I was thinking about
Was cleaning up my conscience
Lost in the memory as it shakes up the corners of my heart
Was it my mistake?
Or maybe it was just as simple as a change in your heart
Mmmm… just as simple as a change of heart
I know now
A love like this won't last forever
I know that a love like this won't last forever
But I, I know that a love like this won't last forever
I know that a love like this won't last forever
But I…
Ooh oohh oohh oohh…
I don't mind at all
A love like this won't last forever
A love like this (a love like this)
A love like this won't last forever
Woah ohh
