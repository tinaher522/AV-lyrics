<song artist="Kodaline" title="Play_The_Game">
Oh my world is turning inside out
Say I'm crying breaking up inside
See my heart is sinking to my knees
Tell me brother what is it you need?
I don't wana be a pretender
I just wanna be me
Nobody
Nobody
Nobody's gonna carry you
Try harder
Get smarter
Dream bigger
Play the game
Oh you’re blaming everybody else
Stop complaining and do it for yourself
Feed your body, your spirit and your mind
Oh my brother just enjoy the ride
I will never be a pretender
I'm just gonna be me
Nobody
Nobody
Nobody's gonna carry you
Try harder
Get smarter
Dream bigger
Play the game
Everybody's got a story to tell
When you’re looking up at heaven but you’re stuck in hell, come on
You gotta play, play the game
Play the game
Nobody
Nobody
Nobody's gonna carry you
Play the game
Try harder
Get smarter
Dream bigger
Play the game
Nobody
Nobody
Nobody's gonna carry you
Play the game
Try harder
Get smarter
Dream bigger
Play the game
