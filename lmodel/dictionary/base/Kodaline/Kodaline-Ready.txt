<song artist="Kodaline" title="Ready">
You tell me that you're ready but you just don’t know
My eyes are getting heavy and it’s starting to show
I’d never seen it coming, never seen a thing
Maybe I’ll get through it if it’s coming to me
‘Cause I’ve been so unlucky I don't know what to say
I’m running out of money, I’ve been wasting away
I’d never seen it coming, never seen a thing
Maybe I’ll get through it if it’s coming to me
We fall (We fall down)
If you fall (We fall down)
If you fall down hard I’ll be ready to crawl
And
I’m ready
I’m ready for it
I’m ready for it
I’m ready for it
All
Look me in the eye when I am talking to you
It’s easy to get nervous I’ve been feeling it too
Yeah it’s kinda crazy
Yeah it’s kinda dumb
Never let the pressure overpower the fun
Yeah I’m sure your parents might be saying it to you
Follow what you love and you will love what you do
Never let the pressure tell you that you’re not 
Capable of being everything that you want
We fall (We fall down)
If you fall (We fall down)
If you fall down hard I’ll be ready to crawl
And
I’m ready
I’m ready for it
I’m ready for it
I’m ready for it
All
I’m ready
I’m ready for it
I’m ready for it
I’m ready for it
All
Look me in the eye when I am talking to you
It’s easy to get nervous I’ve been feeling it too
Yeah it’s kinda crazy
Yeah it’s kinda dumb
Never let the pressure overpower the fun
‘Cause
I’m ready
I’m ready for it
I’m ready for it
I’m ready for it
All
