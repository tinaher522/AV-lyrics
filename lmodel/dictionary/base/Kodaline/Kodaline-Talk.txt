<song artist="Kodaline" title="Talk">
I can remember the good old days,
when you and me used to hide away
where the stars were shining or the sun was blinding our eyes
Yeah you filled up my glass, 
with promises that could never last
And I still find pieces of you in the back of my mind
And all of the things that we once said,
they're not in my heart, they're in my head
That was the time to say goodbye
Let's put it to rest yeah, let it die
'coz we don't, we don't need to talk about this now
Yeah we've been down that road before
That was then and this is now
The crowds in my heart they've been calling out your name
Now it just don't feel the same
I guess it's over, yeah we're done
I heard you made your way downtown
to the place that I've been hanging around
I was looking for your face in the crowd
but trying to keep my head down
Over time our wires crossed
well you changed and truth got lost
All the things I would change if we could only rewind
You were a moment in life that comes and goes
A riddle, a rhyme that no one knows
A change of a heart, a twist of fate
Couldn't fix it, it's too late
'coz we don't, we don't need to talk about this now
Yeah we've been down that road before
That was then and this is now
The crowds in my heart they've been calling out your name
Now it just don't feel the same
I guess it's over, yeah we're done
Woooh
Ooooooooh Ooooooooh Ooooh
We don't, we don't need to talk about this now
We don't, we don't need to talk about this now
We don't, we don't need to talk about this now
We don't, we don't need to talk about this now
