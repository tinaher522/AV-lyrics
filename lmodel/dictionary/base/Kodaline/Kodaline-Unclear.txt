<song artist="Kodaline" title="Unclear">
I am trying to learn and I’m dying to know
When to move on and when to let it go
A curious feeling no one can explain
I just don’t know if I’ll risk it again
When the future's so unsure
When the future's so unclear
So you swallow your heart and you swallow your pride
You gotta be tough if you wanna survive
They’ll chew up and they’ll eat you alive
You shouldn’t give up on the dreams in your mind
When the future's so unsure
When the future's so unclear
When the future's so unsure
When the future's so unclear
We walk, we walk on
Our time, our time will come
We walk, we walk on
Our time
When the future's so unsure (when the future's so unsure)
When the future's so unclear (when the future's so unclear)
When the future's so unsure 
When the future's so unclear
