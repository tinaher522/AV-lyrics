<song artist="Kodaline" title="Everything_Works_Out_In_The_End">
I never seen it coming
I couldn't read the signs
But I know that it means nothing
Cause you are always on my mind
I got tricked into believing
You were the only one for me
But the heart can be deceiving
And I was just too young to see
They told me
Everything works out in the end
Everything works out in the end
Everything works out in the end
Everything works out in the end
You got me treading on the water
Because I've never learned to swim
And now that it's all over
I better learn to start again
They told me
Everything works out in the end
Everything works out in the end
Everything works out in the end
Everything works out in the end
Everything works out in the end
Everything works out in the end
Everything works out in the end
Everything works out in the end
