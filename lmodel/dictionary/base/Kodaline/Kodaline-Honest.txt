<song artist="Kodaline" title="Honest">
We don’t communicate can you not say what’s on your mind.
And I see it every day you hide the truth behind your eyes.
Honestly, there’s no need for you to hide.
Talk to me, can’t you see, I’m on your side.
Honest, honest.
Say what it is you’re trying to say,
But if you lie to me again.
I'll be the one that walks away.
Is it in you to be honest? Honest.
Is it in you to be honest?
I still remember the day we met I was hanging on your every word.
I didn't think I would ever let somebody see into my world.
Honestly, can’t you see, I’m on your side.
Say what it is you’re trying to say,
But if you lie to me again.
I'll be the one that’s walking away.
Is it in you to be honest? Honest.
Is it in you to be honest?
Is it all in my head or was it something I said
Because I’m trying to forgive, and now I’m trying to forget,
You’re telling me all of this, no more hearing of it,
It was all just a lie, was it all just a lie?
Now I’m walking away cause everything that you say
All that you ever tell to me is lies, lies.
Honest, honest. Is it in you to be honest?
Say what it is you’re trying to say,
But if you lie to me again.
I'll be the one that walks away.
Is it in you to be honest?
Honest. Is it in you to be honest?
Is it in you to be honest?
