<song artist="Kodaline" title="Caught_In_The_Middle">
Can you see me below the clouds?
Cause I really feel like I could use you now
Watching over from up above
I can feel you in my heart and in my blood
Where did you go? Where have you gone?
When it's all over do we go on?
I make believe you're still around
It's like we're floating high above the clouds
I'm just caught in the middle waiting for you every night
I wish you would change your mind
Time is like a bubble anytime it's gonna blow
And it's over before you know
Before you know
Disappointments can wear you down
But life goes on and the world keeps spinning around
So be good and appreciate
The life you live is a life you can't replace
I'm just caught in the middle waiting for you every night
I wish you would change your mind
Time is like a bubble anytime it's gonna blow
And it's over before you know
Before you know
Any other second I try to make it better
Try to never leave me alone
I wanna see you now
While I’m breathing I’m wide awake and dreaming
And now you’re starting to show
I really want you to know
I’m just caught, I’m just caught
I'm just caught in the middle waiting for you every night
I wish you would change your mind
Time is like a bubble anytime it's gonna blow
And it's over before you know
I really want you to know
