<song artist="Kodaline" title="Coming_Alive">
You're the clearest sky in the darkest weather
There was a big rain cloud hanging over me
You came along like a lightning bolt from heaven
Then you stole my heart and you set me free
You can’t hide the feeling
Yeah you make it right
I’m coming alive
From the morning sun to the midnight hour
From the break of day to the dark of night
You’re in my head and my heart and it feels much better
Yeah it feels so good and it feels so right
You can’t hide the feeling
Through the days and the nights
Then I might be dreaming
We’ve got time on our side
(I’m coming alive)
In the clearest sky and the darkest weather
There was a big black cloud hanging over me
You came along like a lightning bolt from heaven
Then you stole my heart and you set me free
You can’t hide the feeling
It feels so right
(I’m coming alive)
