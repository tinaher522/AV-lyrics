<song artist="Muse" title="Yes_Please">
Ha, ha, ha, ha
Jump on my pleasure pill?
Yes, please
I cannot sleep
There's too much noise in my head
I cannot sleep
I want it here instead
I never thought that this could come to this
I just wanna live my dreaded bliss in peace now
You will never miss
But I can
I can not keep
The shame that's clawed us out
I will not keep
Your shut-up, shut-up lies
I never thought that this could come to this
I just wanna live my dreaded bliss in peace now
You will never miss
But I can
