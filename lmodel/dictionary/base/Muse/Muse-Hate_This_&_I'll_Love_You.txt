<song artist="Muse" title="Hate_This_&_I'll_Love_You">
Oh, I am growing tired
Of allowing you to steal
Everything I have
You're making me feel
Like I was born to service you
But I am growing by the hour
You left us far behind
So we all discard our souls
And blaze through your skies
So afraid to die
Cos I was born to destroy you
And I am growing by the hour
I'm getting strong in every way, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
You led me on, you led me on
And I'm getting strong in every way, yeah
Yeah, yeah
