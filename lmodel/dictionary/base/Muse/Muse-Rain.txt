<song artist="Muse" title="Rain">
Come with me to nowhere
And I'll show you nothing special
I'm still pleased to see you
Alive
I know you'll forget me
But I don't care 'cause I'm always with you
You don't care for anyone
Ooh
I'm not gonna let you
I'm not gonna let your love kill me
My heart is strong enough
To let them know this
I just need a witness
To say that I was there to feel this
You'll forget me
So come with me to nowhere
And I'll show you nothing special
I'm still pleased to see you
Alive
I'm not gonna let you
I'm not gonna let your love kill me
My heart is strong enough
To let them know this
'Cause I just need to know that I can
'Cause I just need to know that I can
I won't let you
I'm not gonna let your love kill
Now that you know
I'm stronger
