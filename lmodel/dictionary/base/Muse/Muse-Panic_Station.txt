<song artist="Muse" title="Panic_Station">
You won't get much closer
Until you sacrifice it all
You won't get to taste it
With your face against the wall
Get up and commit
Show the power trapped within
Do just what you want to
And now stand up and begin
Ooh, 1, 2, 3, 4, fire's in your eyes
And this chaos, it defies imagination
Ooh, 5, 6, 7, minus 9 lives
You've arrived at panic station
Doubts will try to break you
Unleash your heart and soul
Trouble will surround you
Start taking some control
Stand up and deliver
Your wildest fantasy
Do what the fuck you want to
There's no one to appease
Ooh, 1, 2, 3, 4, fire's in your eyes
And this chaos, it defies imagination
Ooh, 5, 6, 7, minus 9 lives
You've arrived at panic station
Ooh, 1, 2, 3, 4, fire's in your eyes
And this chaos, it defies imagination
Ooh, 5, 6, 7, minus 9 lives
And I know that you will fight for the duration
Ooh, 1, 2, 3, 4, fire's in your eyes
And you know I'm not resisting your temptations
Ooh, 5, 6, 7, minus 9 lives
You've arrived at panic station
