<song artist="Muse" title="Madness">
M-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-mad, mad, mad
M-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-mad, mad, mad
M-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-mad, mad, mad
M-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-mad, mad, mad
I, I can't get these memories
Out of my mind
And some kind of madness
Is starting to evolve
(M-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-mad, mad, mad)
Ooh
(M-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-mad, mad, mad)
And I, I tried so hard to let you go
But some kind of madness
Is swallowing me whole
(M-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-mad, mad, mad)
Yeah
(M-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-mad, mad, mad)
I have finally seen the light
And I have finally realized
What you mean
Huh, huh, huh, huh-huh-huh, oh
And now 
I need to know is this real love
Or is it just madness
Keeping us afloat?
(M-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-mad, mad, mad)
Mmm
(M-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-mad, mad, mad)
But when I look back
At all the crazy fights we had
It's like some kind of madness
Was taking control
(M-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-mad, mad, mad)
Yeah
(M-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-mad, mad, mad)
Now, I have finally seen the light
And I have finally realized
What you need
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm-mmm-mmm, mmm
(M-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-mad, mad, mad)
(M-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-mad, mad, mad)
And now, I have finally seen the end (Finally seen the end)
And I'm not expecting you to care (Expecting you to care)
That I have finally seen the light (Finally seen the light)
And I have finally realized (Realized)
I need your love
I need your love
Come to me
Just in a dream
Come on and rescue me
Yes, I know
I can't be wrong 
And baby, you're too headstrong
Our love is 
(M-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-mad, mad, mad)
(M-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-mad, mad, mad)
(M-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-mad, mad, mad)
(M-m-m-m-m-m-m)
