<song artist="Muse" title="Defector">
Free, yeah I am free from your inciting
You can't brainwash me, you've got a problem
Free, yeah I'm free from society
You can't control me, I'm a defector
You think you're strong and you can't be broken
But your empire is dissolving
You thought, you thought I was weak
But you got it wrong
Look into my eyes I'm a defector
Free, yeah I am free from your inciting
You can't brainwash me, you've got a problem
Free, yeah I'm free from society
You can't control me, I'm a defector
Your blood is blue and your mind's turned green
And your belly is all yellow
You believe, your throne is too high to be overthrown
We'll watch it get razed by a defector
Free, yeah I am free from your inciting
You can't brainwash me, you've got a problem
Free, yeah I'm free from society
You can't control me, I'm a defector
I'm a defector
Free, yeah I am free from your inciting
You can't brainwash me, you've got a problem
Free, yeah I'm free from society
You can't control me, I'm a defector
JFK continued:
We look for strength and assistance, confident that with your help
Man will be what he was born to be: free and independent
