<song artist="Muse" title="Forameus">
Our lives at stake
I just wanna give it away
Our lives at stake
So let's just sign it away
It doesn't matter
It doesn't matter
It doesn't matter
It doesn't matter
Falling once again
You'll do it anyway
You do it to me once again
You do it to me night and day
You do it do it all again
Ooooooo
You do it to me once again
You do it to me night and day
You do it do it all again
Our lives at stake
I just wanna give it away
And our lives disdain yeah
So let's just sign it away
It doesn't matter...
It doesn't matter...
It doesn't matter...
It doesn't matter...
Falling once again
You'll do it anyway
You do it to me once again
You do it to me night and day
You do it do it all again
Oooo
You do it to me once again
You do it to me night and day
You do it do it all again
Yeah yeah yeah yeeeeeeeeeeeeeah!
(sung really fast)
You do it to me once again
You do it to me night and day
You do it do it all again
You do it to me once again
You do it to me night and day
You do it do it all again
