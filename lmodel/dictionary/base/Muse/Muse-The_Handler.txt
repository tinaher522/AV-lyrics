<song artist="Muse" title="The_Handler">
You were my oppressor
And I, I have been programmed to obey
Now, you are my handler
And I, I will execute your demands
Leave me alone
I must disassociate from you
Behold my trance formation
And you are empowered to do as you please
My mind was lost in translation
And my heart has become a cold and impassive machine
Leave me alone
I must disassociate from you
I won't let you control my feelings any more
I will no longer do as I am told
I am no longer afraid to walk alone
Let me go, let me be
I'm escaping from your grip
You will never own me again
