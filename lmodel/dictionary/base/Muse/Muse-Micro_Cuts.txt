<song artist="Muse" title="Micro_Cuts">
Hands are red with your blame
Megaphone screaming my name
Whimpers someone I should've loved
Souls weeping above
I've seen what you're doing to me
Destroying puppet strings
To our souls
Micro waves me insane
A blade cuts in your brain
Sounds like forks on a plate
Blackboard scratched with hate
I've seen what you're doing to me
Destroying puppet strings
To our souls
