<song artist="Muse" title="Falling_Down">
I'm falling down
And fifteen thousand people scream
They were all begging for your dream
I'm falling down
Five thousand houses burning down
No one is gonna save this town
Too late
I already found what I was looking for
You know it wasn't here
No, it wasn't here
I was calling your name
But you would never hear me sing
You wouldn't let me begin
So I'm crawling away
Cos you broke my heart in two, yeah
No, I will not forget you
Too late
I already found what I was looking for
You know it wasn't you
No, it wasn't you, no
Falling away
You would never see me through
No, I could not forget you
Falling down
A thousand houses burning down, yeah
No one is gonna save this town
Too late
I already found what I was looking for
You know it wasn't you
No, it wasn't you, no
Falling down
Now the world is upside down, yeah
I'm heading straight for the clouds
