<song artist="Muse" title="Coma">
Confide in me
Sustain on my apathy
You're such a mess
You can learn not to confess
You will not find it in me
Simply because I can't
Wake up and find it in me
I'm in a coma
You will not find it in me
You'll reveal all your pains again
We'll fall asleep
So deeply out of reach
For years feeling dead
We can fall right out of bed
You will not find it in me
Simply because I can't
Wake and find it in me
I'm in a coma
You will not find it in me
You'll reveal all your pains again
Hey such a mess but I don't care
Simply because I can't
Wake and find it in me
I'm in a coma
You will not find it in me 
You'll reveal all your pains again
