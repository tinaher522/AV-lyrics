<song artist="Muse" title="Animals">
Animal, you're an animal
Don't take anything less
Out of control, you're out of control
Strike those in distress
Analyse, advertise, expand
Bend more rules
And buy yourself an island
Animals, we're animals
Buy when blood is on the street
Out of control, we're out of control
Crush those who beg at your feet
Analyse, franchise, spread out
Kill the competition
And buy yourself an ocean
Amortise, downsize, lay off
Kill yourself
Come on and do us all a favour
