<song artist="Muse" title="Reapers">
Home, it's becoming a killing field
There's a cross-hair locked on my heart
With no recourse
And there's no one behind the wheel
Hellfire, you are wiping me out
Killed by
Drones!
Killed by
Drones!
Killed by
You rule with lies and deceit
And the world is on your side
You've got the CIA, babe
(You can run but you're never gonna hide, you can run but you're never gonna gonna gonna)
And all you've done is brutalise
(You can run but you're never gonna hide, you can run but you're never gonna gonna gonna
Drones!)
War, war just moved up a gear
I don't think I can handle the truth
I'm just a pawn
And we're all expendable
Incidentally, electronically erased
By your
Drones!
Killed by
Drones!
Killed by
You kill by remote control
And the world is on your side
You've got Reapers and Hawks, babe
(You can run but you're never gonna hide, you can run but you're never gonna gonna gonna)
Now I am radicalised
(You can run but you're never gonna hide, you can run but you're never gonna gonna gonna
Drones!)
Killed by
(You can run but you're never gonna hide, you can run but you're never gonna gonna gonna)
(You can run but you're never gonna hide, you can run but you're never gonna gonna gonna)
You rule with lies and deceit
And the world is on your side
You've got the CIA, babe
All you've done is brutalise
You kill by remote control
(You can run but you're never gonna hide, you can run but you're never gonna gonna gonna)
And the world is on your side
(You can run but you're never gonna hide, you can run but you're never gonna gonna gonna)
You've got Reapers and Hawks babe
(You can run but you're never gonna hide, you can run but you're never gonna gonna gonna)
Now I am radicalised
(You can run but you're never gonna hide, you can run but you're never gonna gonna gonna)
Here come the drones!
Here come the drones!
Here come the drones!
