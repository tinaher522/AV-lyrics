<song artist="Muse" title="Cave">
Leave me alone, it's nothing serious
I'll do it myself, it's got naught to do with you
And there's nothing that you could do
You can see it and you can almost hear it, too
You can almost taste it, it's got naught to do with you
And there's still nothing that you could do
So come in my cave
And I'll burn your heart away
Come in my cave
And I'll burn your heart away
Please close your ears and try to look away
So you'll never hear a, a single word I say
And don't ever come my way
Leave me alone, it's nothing serious
I'll do it myself, it's got naught to do with you
And there's still nothing that you could do
So come in my cave
And I'll burn your heart away
Come in my cave
And arrest me for my mistakes, yeah
