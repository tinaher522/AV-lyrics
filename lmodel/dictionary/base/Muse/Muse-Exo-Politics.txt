<song artist="Muse" title="Exo-Politics">
Open the skies over me
I am waiting patiently
I'll wait for a sign
As conspiracies unwind
Will you slam shut or free your mind
Or stay hypnotised?
When the Zetas fill the skies
Will our leaders tell us why?
Fully loaded satellites
Will conquer nothing but our minds
I'm waiting patiently
I'll wait for the sign
Carried through the centuries
Secrets locked up
And loaded on my back
Well it weighs me down...
When the Zetas fill the skies
It's just our leaders in disguise
Fully loaded satellites
Will conquer nothing but our minds
I'm waiting patiently
I'll wait for the sign
I'm waiting patiently
I'll wait for the sign
