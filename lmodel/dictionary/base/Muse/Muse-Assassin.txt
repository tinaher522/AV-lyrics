<song artist="Muse" title="Assassin">
War is overdue
The time has come for you
To shoot your leaders down
And join forces underground
Lose control
(Losing control)
In increasing pace
(Increasing pace)
Warped and bewitched
(Warped and bewitched)
In time to erase
(Crime to erase)
Whatever they say
(Ever they say)
These people are torn
(People are torn)
Wild and bereft
(Wild and bereft)
Assassin is born
(Assassin is born)
Oppose and disagree
Destroy demon-ocracy
Lose control
(Losing control)
In increasing pace
(Increasing pace)
Warped and bewitched
(Warped and bewitched)
In time to erase
(Crime to erase)
Whatever they say
(Ever they say)
These people are torn
(People are torn)
Wild and bereft
(Wild and bereft)
Assassin is born
(Assassin is born)
