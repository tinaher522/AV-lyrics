<song artist="Muse" title="Map_Of_Your_Head">
I'm sick of feeding my soul
To people who'll never know
Just how purposeless and empty they've grown
Because their language confuses
Like computers refuse
To understand how I'm feeling today
I'm freezing
And losing my way
I don't need another map of your head
I am freezing
And losing my way
I don't need another map of your head
I saw a liquid control
That gives life to us all
I hit my head on it
And woke up to know
That I was all alone
Wearing just socks and a phone
Someone screaming like their world might explode
Yeah I'm freezing
And losing my way
I don't need another map of your head
I'm freezing 
And losing my way
I don't want another map of your head
Freezing
And losing my way
I don't want another map of your head
I'm freezing
And losing my way
I don't need another map of your head
Yeah
