<song artist="Muse" title="Falling_With_The_Crowd">
So I will close my ears to the falling with the crowd
I never thought of her
I listen to your air
Try to shout and I will smile
You can hear, hear your infectious laugh
But you can’t hear me ring the bell
You can hear, hear you singing along to this 
And pretending not to hear me shout
Too many heard
So I will close my ears to the falling with the crowd
I never thought of her
I listen to your air
Try to shout and I will smile
I never thought of her
(Falling with the crowd)
Here’s to my mistake
(Falling with the crowd)
I wanna go home
Dressed by no one else
Doesn’t matter cause I’m not that sure
To aware of whats been done before
You can hear, hear you singing along to this 
And pretending not to hear me shout
You know its true
So I will close my ears to the falling with the crowd
I never thought of her
I listen to your air
Try to shout and I will smile
I never thought of her
(Falling with the crowd)
Dressed my breath to live
I wanna go home
Dressed by no one else
Drilled into my cave
