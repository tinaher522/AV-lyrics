<song artist="Muse" title="Prague">
It breaks my heart
To leave you far behind
It breaks me up
To leave so suddenly
Knowing we might never
Meet again
It hurts so much
To lose another friend
I could hope you're just as sad
To see me go
But I'd hate to be the cause
Of grief to someone I like so
Knowing we might never
Meet again
It hurts so much
To lose another friend.
