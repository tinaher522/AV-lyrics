<song artist="Muse" title="Resistance">
Is our secret safe tonight and are we out of sight?
Or will our world come tumbling down?
Will they find our hiding place, is this our last embrace?
Or will the walls start caving in?
It could be wrong, could be wrong
But it should've been right
It could be wrong, could be wrong
To let our hearts ignite
It could be wrong, could be wrong
Are we digging a hole?
It could be wrong, could be wrong
This is out of control
It could be wrong, could be wrong
It could never last
It could be wrong, could be wrong
Must erase it fast
It could be wrong, could be wrong
But it could've been right
It could be wrong, could be
Love is our resistance
They'll keep us apart and they won't stop breaking us down
And hold me
Our lips must always be sealed
If we live our life in fear, I'll wait a thousand years
Just to see you smile again
Quell your prayers for love and peace, you'll wake the thought police
We can hide the truth inside
It could be wrong, could be wrong
But it should've been right
It could be wrong, could be wrong
To let our hearts ignite
It could be wrong, could be wrong
Are we digging a hole?
It could be wrong, could be wrong
This is out of control
It could be wrong, could be wrong
It could never last
It could be wrong, could be wrong
Must erase it fast
It could be wrong, could be wrong
But it could've been right
It could be wrong, could be
Love is our resistance
They'll keep us apart and they won't stop breaking us down
Hold me
Our lips must always be sealed
The night has reached its end
We can't pretend
We must run
We must run
It's time to run
Take us away from here
Protect us from further harm
Resistance
