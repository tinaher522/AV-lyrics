<song artist="Muse" title="The_Groove">
So here it goes again
Rape and pillage proves
To win the public vote
Someone tell me who will take the prize
And who takes the fall
So confused
When you're lost in the groove
So confused
When you're lost in the groove
And downtown comes again
And her masks are shifting like a chameleon
Someone tell me why she breaks my fall
And then breaks my heart
So confused
When you're lost in the groove
So confused
When you're lost in the groove
Wow
So confused
When you're lost in the groove
So confused
When you're lost in the groove
