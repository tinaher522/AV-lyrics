<song artist="Muse" title="Pink_Ego_Box">
It's gonna be ok
Can't afford another day
At 50 bytes per second
I've never seen your face
I've never heard your voice
But I think I like it
When you instant message me
With a promise
I can feel it
I can tell you're gonna be
Just like me
My eyes are gonna strain
My heart is feeling pain
At 50 beats per second
I've never seen your eyes
I've never heard your lies
But I think I like it
When you instant message me
With a promise
I can feel it
I can tell you're gonna be
Just like me
Just like me
You tell
You tell
You turn on me
