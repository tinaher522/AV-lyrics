<song artist="Muse" title="Assassin_(Grand_Omega_Bosses_Edit)">
War is overdue
The time has come for you
To shoot your leaders down
Join forces underground
Lose control
And increasing pace
Warped and bewitched
Time to erase
Whatever they say
These people are torn
Wild and bereft
Assassin is born, yeah
Aim, shoot, kill your leaders
They'll try to steal your life
So watch your back
You're not alone
But you must actualise
The first attack 
Oppose and disagree
Destroy demonocracy
Lose control
And increasing pace
Warped and bewitched
Time to erase
Whatever they say
These people are torn
Wild and bereft
Assassin is born, yeah
