<song artist="Muse" title="Fury">
You're so happy now
Burning the candle at both ends
Your self loving soothes
And softens the blows you've invented
Breathe in deep
And cleanse away our sins
And we'll pray
That there's no God to punish us
And make a fuss
Cracks healing up
The future soul forgives this mess
You waste twenty years
And wind up alone demented
Breathe in deep
And cleanse away our sins
And we'll pray
That there's no God to punish us
And make a fuss
Breathe in deep
And cleanse away our sins
And we'll pray
That there's no God to punish us
And make a fuss
