<song artist="Muse" title="Eternally_Missed">
Chase your dreams away
Glass needles in the hay
The sun forgives the clouds
You are my holy shroud
I just don't care if it's real
That won't change how it feels
I just don't care if it's real
That won't change how it feels
No it doesn't change
And you can't resist
Making me feel eternally missed
And you can't resist
And you can't resist
Making me feel
Chase your dreams away
Glass needles in the hay
The sun forgives the clouds
You are my holy shroud
And I just don't care if it's real
That won't change how it feels
I just don't care if it's real
That won't change how it feels
No it doesn't change
And you can't resist
Making me feel eternally missed
You can't resist
You can't resist
Making me feel
You can't resist
Making me feel eternally missed
You can't resist
You can't resist
Making me feel
And you can't resist
Making me feel eternally missed
And you can't resist
And you can't resist
Making me feel
(Distorted whisper)
Chase your dreams away
There's needle's in the hay
The sun forgives the clouds
You are my holy shroud
