<song artist="Muse" title="House_Of_The_Rising_Sun">
There is a house in New Orleans
They call the Rising Sun
Well it's been the ruin of many a poor boy
And, God, I know I'm one
Oh mother, tell your children
Not to do what I have done
You spend your lives in sin and misery
In the house of the Rising Sun
Well there is a house in New Orleans
They call the Rising Sun
And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy
And God I know I'm one
