<song artist="Muse" title="Nature_1">
Conforming on a Monday 
Too often and too cold 
But you aren't even listening 
Because you are just 
Too old to feel an earthquake 
Or too cool to even care 
But you aren't even listening 
So why should I? 
You are 
A natural disaster 
And I've wanted you too much 
And now I'm gonna lose 
I've wanted you too much 
And now I've gotta choose 
You're the cause of all this 
And I'm sick of trying to please you 
And you're gonna feel my emotions coming 
Because you're the world 
Like a broken dam you're empty 
And all that's left are the sticks and stones 
That were built by other people 
And it really shows 
But you aren't even listening 
Because you are just 
Too old to feel an earthquake 
Or too cool to even care 
But you aren't even listening 
So why should I? 
You are 
A natural disaster 
And I've wanted you too much 
And now I'm gonna lose 
I've wanted you too much 
And now I've gotta choose 
You're the cause of all this 
And I'm sick of trying to please you 
And you're gonna feel my emotions coming 
Because you're the world
