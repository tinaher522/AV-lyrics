<song artist="Muse" title="Twin">
Your warmth
Your warmth is so deep
Your gaze beams a hole into me 
Controlling again 
Unseparated twins 
Controlling again 
You've sucked 
All the breath out of me 
You'll squeeze all the life out of me
Controlling again 
Unseparated twins 
Controlling again 
Controlling again 
Unseparated twins 
You might've been
Come gentle slowly
Down tonight
