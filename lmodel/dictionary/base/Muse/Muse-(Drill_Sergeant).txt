Drill sergeant:
"If you do not do what you are told to do, when you are told to do it, you will be punished! Do you understand?"
Recruit:
Aye sir!
"If you leave my base without proper authorisation, I will hunt you down and throw your ass in jail! Do you understand?"
Aye sir!
"I can't hear you!"
Aye sir!
"Scream it!"
Aye sir!
"Your ass belongs to me now"
Aye sir!
