Loneliness be over
When will this loneliness be over?
Fear and panic in the air
I want to be free
From desolation and despair
And I feel like everything I saw
Is being swept away
Well I refuse to let you go
I can't get it right
Get it right
Since I met you
Loneliness be over
When will this loneliness be over?
Fear and panic in the air
I want to be free
From desolation and despair
And I feel like everything I saw
Is being swept away
Well I refuse to let you go
Loneliness be over
When will this loneliness be over?
Loneliness be over
When will this loneliness be over?
Fear and panic in the air
I want to be free
From desolation and despair
And I feel like everything I saw
Is being swept away
Well I refuse to let you go
I can't get it right
Get it right
Since I met you

Loneliness be over
When will this loneliness be over?
Loneliness be over
When will this loneliness be over?
