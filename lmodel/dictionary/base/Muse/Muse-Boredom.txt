<song artist="Muse" title="Boredom">
We should be in the summer spirit
But it might as well be rain
We should be having such a good time
But I'm so bored it's causing me pain
My dear
This love is dead
Somehow, someway
You'll come away
With you it's dead
I can't let you pretend
These days
(These days)
Are the best you've had
Doesn't matter 'cause I love you
Stop telling me to try and cheer up
I just don't wanna be here
We should be having such a good time
But you're no good
No, you are going blind
My dear
This love is dead
There's no way
You'll come away
With you it's dead
I can't let you pretend
These days
(These days)
Are the best you've had
My dear, this love is dead
Somehow, someway
You'll come away
