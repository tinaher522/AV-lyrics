<song artist="Muse" title="Uno">
This means nothing to me
Cos you are nothing to me
And it means nothing to me
That you blew this away
Cos you could have been number one
If you'd only found the time
And you could have ruled the whole world
If you'd had the chance
You could have been number one
And you could have ruled the whole world
And we could have had so much fun
But you blew it away
You're still nothing to me
And this is nothing to me
And you don't know what you've done
But I'll give you a clue
You could have been number one
If you'd only had the chance
And you could have ruled the whole world
If you'd had the time
You could have been number one
And you could have ruled the whole world
And we could have had so much fun
But you blew it away
And you could have been number one
And you could have ruled the whole world
And we could have had so much fun
But you blew it away
