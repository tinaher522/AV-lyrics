<song artist="Muse" title="Aftermath">
War is all around
I'm growing tired of fighting
I've been drained and I can't hide it
But I have strength for you
You're all that's real anymore
I am coming home now
I need your comfort
From this moment
From this moment
You'll never be alone
We're bound together
Now and forever
The loneliness has gone
States are crumbling
And walls are rising high again
It's no place for the faint hearted
But my heart is strong
Because now I know where I belong
It's you and I against the world
We are free
From this moment
From this moment
You'll never be alone
We're bound together
Now and forever
The loneliness has gone
We've gone against the tide
All we have is each other now
I am coming home now
I need your comfort
From this moment
From this moment (From this moment)
You'll never be alone (Never be alone)
We're bound together (Bound together)
Now and forever (Now and forever)
The loneliness has gone
From this moment (From this moment)
From this moment (From this moment)
You'll never be alone (Never be alone)
We're bound together
Now and forever
The loneliness has gone
From this moment
From this moment (From this moment)
You'll never be alone
We're bound together
Now and forever
The loneliness has gone
Bound together
Now and forever
Loneliness has gone
