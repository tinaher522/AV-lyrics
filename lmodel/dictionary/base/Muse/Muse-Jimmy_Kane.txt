<song artist="Muse" title="Jimmy_Kane">
Jimmy Kane can't sleep at night
Sex and pain
Keeps me alive
You can't confuse yourself
Mimicking no one else
You can't fake it
You will never make it
You can't confuse yourself
Mimicking no one else
You can't fake it
You will never make it
Yeah
You're to blame
For everything
Sex and pain
Keeps moving me
Keeps me
You can't confuse yourself
Mimicking no one else
You can't fake it
You will never make it
You can't confuse yourself
Mimicking no one else
You can't fake it
You will never make it
Yeah
