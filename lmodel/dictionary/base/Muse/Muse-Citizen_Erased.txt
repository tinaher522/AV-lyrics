<song artist="Muse" title="Citizen_Erased">
Break me in, teach us to cheat
And to lie and cover up
What shouldn't be shared
And the truth unwinding
Scraping away at my mind
Please stop asking me to describe
For one moment
I wish you'd hold your stage
With no feelings at all
Open minded
I'm sure I used to be so free
Self expressed, exhausting for all to see
And to be what you want
And what you need
And the truth's unwinding
Scraping away at my mind
Please stop asking me to describe
For one moment
I wish you'd hold your stage
With no feelings at all
Open minded,
I'm sure I used to be so free
For one moment
I wish you'd hold your stage
With no feelings at all
Open minded
I'm sure I used to be so free
Wash me away
Clean your body of me
Erase all the memories
They'll only bring us pain
And I've seen all I'll ever need
