<song artist="Muse" title="Big_Freeze">
Healed or are you still just reeling?
Are you fine, have you found a way to escape?
Are you here just because I need you?
Can we hole up, a big freeze is heading our way
We are on a hiding to nowhere
We still hope, but our dreams are not the same, no
And I, I lost before I started
I'm collapsing in stellar clouds of gas
Hear me
What words just can't convey
Feel me
Don't let the sun in your heart decay
Fight or will you show me mercy?
We've expelled the goodness from our hearts
Are you here just to prove you're winning?
Can we hole up and ride out this electrical storm?
We destroyed something beautiful
We have faith, but our truths are not the same, no
Don't give up, don't let the magic leave us
Stop the loneliest force becoming king of the universe
Hear me
What words just can't convey
Feel me
Don't let the sun in your heart decay
Don't give up, don't let the magic leave us
We're collapsing in stellar clouds of gas, yeah
Hear me
What words just can't convey
Feel me
I won't let the sun in our hearts decay
