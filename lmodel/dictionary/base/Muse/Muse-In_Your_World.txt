<song artist="Muse" title="In_Your_World">
I'm hurting you again
To lonely to pretend
Like everything is new
I promise you to
Blow it all away
In your world
No one is crying alone
In your world
No one is dying alone
Too broken to belong
too weak to sing along
I'll comfort you my friend
Helping you to
Blow it all away
In your world
No one is crying alone
In your world
No one is dying alone
