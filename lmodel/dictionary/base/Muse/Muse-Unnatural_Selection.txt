<song artist="Muse" title="Unnatural_Selection">
They'll laugh as they watch us fall
The lucky don't care at all
No chance for fate
It's unnatural selection
I want the truth
I'm hungry for some unrest
I wanna push it beyond a peaceful protest
I wanna speak in a language that they will understand
Dedication to a new age
Is this the end of destruction and rampage?
Another chance to erase and then repeat it again
Counter balance this commotion
We're not droplets in the ocean
Ocean
They'll laugh as they watch us fall
The lucky don't care at all
No (hey) chance (hey) for fate (hey)
It's unnatural selection
I want the truth
No religion or mind virus
Is there a hope that the facts would ever find us
Just make sure that you are looking out for number one
And I'm hungry for some unrest
Well, let's push it beyond a peaceful protest
I wanna speak in a language that you will understand
Counter balance this commotion
We're not droplets in the ocean
Ocean
They'll laugh as they watch us crawl
The lucky don't share at all
No (hey) chance (hey) for fate (hey)
It's a random chance selection
I want the truth
Try to ride out the storm
Whilst they'll make you believe
That they are the special ones
(We have not been chosen)
Injustice is the norm
You won't be the first
And you know that you won't be the last
Counter balance this commotion
We're not droplets in the ocean
Ocean, ocean, ocean
They'll laugh as they watch us fall
And the lucky they don't care at all
No (hey) chance (hey) for fate (hey)
It's unnatural selection
I want the truth
I want the truth
I want the truth
I want the truth
