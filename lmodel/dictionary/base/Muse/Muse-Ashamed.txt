<song artist="Muse" title="Ashamed">
I know there's something that you're dying to tell me
I hope it's not about your loving 
Make sure no-one finds out
Tell me all about it
Don't keep it to yourself
'cause I can't bear the thought
I never needed your cry
But I love your cry
Doesn't matter, 'cause I'm in control
I know that you're ashamed
So emotional that it kills you
Don't you know that you're ashamed?
So emotional that you cry
There's always something that makes you guilty
There's still something that you're dying to tell me
Make sure no-one finds out
Tell me all about it
Don't keep it to yourself
'cause I can't bear the thought
I never needed your cry
But I love your cry
Doesn't matter, 'cause I'm in control
I know that you're ashamed
So emotional that it kills you
Don't you know that you're ashamed?
So emotional that you cry
