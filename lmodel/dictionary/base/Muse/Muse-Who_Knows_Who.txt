<song artist="Muse" title="Who_Knows_Who">
Money men mill about Monday morning
Another new nothing and never nearer
Assumed at the cost that it's currently costing
I dare don't dig any deeper down
I don't have the head space.
I don't understand all the figures and facts
It'll spin round till I start panic attacking
But there's one curve ball that states my soul
Let me live out life and I'll stay in control.
You take that away, I'll never get dressed
Money men milling in, Monday morning
I will go spend, or I will raise warning
I'm nothing but me and mine, so.
Yeah I've been and gone
With who knows who
Doing God knows what
Don't tell me how
I'll return at any hour
Fuck all your law, fuck your power.
Yeah I've been and gone
With who knows who
Doing God knows what
Don't tell me how
I'll return at any hour
Fuck all your law, fuck your power.
My name's magic and it's mud
I do bad things, but I can't rob
They don't buy anything, they watch it 
See, for their time is the commodity
The gap between art and artists grows
I'll never know why I ever wrote this prose
I write this rubbish, but believe you me
I've just never been keen on tasting redness
But put the orange suit on
Shackle my ankles
I couldnt take that, I'd be fucking...
[Get it Off!]
Yeah I've been and gone
With who knows who
Doing God knows what
Don't tell me how
I'll return at any hour
Fuck all your law, fuck your power. 
Yeah I've been and gone
With who knows who
Doing God knows what
Don't tell me how
I'll return at any hour
Fuck all your law, fuck your power.
I don't promote no violence
But if you all get carted off
Boys will be boys, toys'll get tossed
Bang me up, right and rough
I'm not a people beater but
If that law gets made up, I may
Show me the cross, and I'll take it on
Show me the cross, and I'll take it on
I don't promote no violence
But if you all get carted off
Boys will be boys, toys'll get tossed
Bang me up, right and rough
I'm not a people beater but
If that law gets made up, I may
Show them the cross, and I'll take it on
Show them the cross, and I'll take it on
(Don't go! No!)
Tell me what you want
Tell me what you want
Tell me what you want
Tell me what you want
Tell me what you want
Tell me what you want
Tell me what you want
Tell me what you want
Yeah I've been and gone
With who knows who
Doing God knows what
Don't tell me how
I'll return at any hour
Fuck all your law, fuck your power.
Yeah I've been and gone
With who knows who
Doing God knows what
Don't tell me how
I'll return at any hour
Fuck all your law, fuck your power.
