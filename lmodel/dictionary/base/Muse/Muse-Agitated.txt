<song artist="Muse" title="Agitated">
You make me agitated 
With all the things you've hated
But you're uncomplicated
So why should it affect you
That my loving was so untrue?
You do it to me sweetly
To my yeah yeah
You do it to me lovely
To my yeah yeah
You try to make me crazy
You make me agitated
But we're not suffocated
So why should it affect you
That my loving was so untrue?
You do it to me sweetly
To my yeah yeah
You do it to me lovely
To my yeah yeah
