<song artist="Muse" title="Con-science">
I can't pretend
Choose how it ends
You slipped away
Questions here to stay
In fear, in sorrow, in fear, in sorrow
I can't pretend
Consumed by an ends
Try bend the rules
Rips out the cruels
In fear, in sorrow, in fear, in sorrow
I can't pretend
Choose how it ends
You slipped away
Questions here to stay
In sorrow, in fear, in sorrow, in fear
In fear, in sorrow, in fear, in sorrow
