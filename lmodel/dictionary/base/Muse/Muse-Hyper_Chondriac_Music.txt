<song artist="Muse" title="Hyper_Chondriac_Music">
Your golden lies feed my role 
In this forgotten space race under my control 
Who's returned from the dead? 
Who remains?
You wanted more than I was worth 
You think I was scared yeah 
And you needed proof 
Who really cares anymore? 
Who restrains?
I don't love you and I never did 
I don't love you and I never will
