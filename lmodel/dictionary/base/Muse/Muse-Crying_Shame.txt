<song artist="Muse" title="Crying_Shame">
Too Late
And yeah baby it's too late
And time has made the spell obey
And now it's time to desecrate
But we had a dream
And it was meant to be
And we were kissing gods
Against all the odds
Now it's a crying shame
And it's a crying shame
We don't know who to blame
It'll never be the same
And it's a crying shame
Too much
And we demolish too much
And yeah we really fucked it up
Yeah baby you lost your touch
But we had a dream
And it was meant to be
And we were kissing gods
Against all the odds
Now it's a crying shame
And it's a crying shame
You don't know who to blame
It'll never be the same
And it's a crying shame
And it's a crying shame
