<song artist="Muse" title="Shine_Acoustic">
Who cares for the life we've earned?
Someone sold all the truth you yearned
Remember when you used to shine
And had no fear or sense of time
When it creeps up on you
You can't cry now, there's nothing to feel
No one has noticed our loneliness
Remember when you used to tease
And made us scream eternal joy
I believed that you'd always be here
'cause once you promised a life with no fear
Please don't break my ideas
And say what's fake was always real
I was the one
And now I'm gone
Take me back again
