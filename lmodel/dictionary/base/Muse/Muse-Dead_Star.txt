<song artist="Muse" title="Dead_Star">
Shame on you for thinking that you're an exception
We're all to blame
Crashing down to Earth
Wasting and burning out yeah
Fading like a dead star
Harm is coming your way
Yeah it's coming your way
You used to be everything to me
And now you're tired of fighting
Tired of fighting, fighting yourself
Shame on you for thinking you're all alone
If you want I'll make you wish you were
Failing to impress
Why can't you sleep with someone who'll protect you
Harm is coming your way
Yeah it's coming your way
You used to be everything to me
And now you're tired of fighting
Tired of fighting, of fighting yourself
