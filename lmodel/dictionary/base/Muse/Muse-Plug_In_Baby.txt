<song artist="Muse" title="Plug_In_Baby">
I've exposed your lies, baby
The underneath's no big surprise
And now it's time for changing
And cleansing everything
To forget your love
My plug-in baby
Crucifies my enemies
When I'm tired of giving, wohoh
My plug-in baby
In unbroken virgin realities
Is tired of living, oooh
Don't confuse
Baby you're gonna lose your own game
Change me, replace the envying
To forget your love
My plug-in baby
Crucifies my enemies
When I'm tired of giving, wohoh
My plug-in baby
In unbroken virgin realities
Is tired of living, oooh
And I've seen your loving
Mine is gone
And I've been in trouble
Whoa
