<song artist="Lily_Allen" title="Who_Do_You_Love?">
You know it always feels like you take her side
Clicks her fingers and you arrive to see her cry
I’ve got two of my own kids, I’m a slave to my mortgage
I don’t ask you for nothing, will it always be like this?
And you’re struggling to hide it
And I know you’ve decided
It’s not each in your own way
I can tell but you won’t say
Who d'you love, who d'you love, who d'you love
Who d'you love, who d'you love?
Who d'you love, who d'you love, who d'you love
Who d'you love, who d'you love?
Who d'you love, who d'you love, who d'you love
Who d'you love, who d'you love?
Who d'you love, who d'you love, who d'you love
Who d'you love, who'd you love, who d'you really love?
She reads like a textbook, I do things in other ways
Never did understand, and when she cries I walk away
She has younger than my kids, you’re a slave for her baggage
And I try, but it wears thin, to be nice but I can’t win
You’re struggling to hide it
And I know you’ve decided
It’s not each in your own way
I can tell but you won’t say
Who d'you love, who d'you love, who d'you love
Who d'you love, who d'you love?
Who d'you love, who d'you love, who d'you love
Who d'you love, who d'you love?
Who d'you love, who d'you love, who d'you love
Who d'you love, who d'you love?
Who d'you love, who d'you love, who d'you love
Who d'you love, who'd you love, who d'you really love?
Mother, mother, mother
I’m in need of your attention
Can we hold a conversation
Where she goes without a mention?
If I make it look easy
You can blame my good intentions
Take a walk in my world
Take a walk in my world
Who d'you love, who d'you love, who d'you love
Who d'you love, who d'you love?
Who d'you love, who d'you love, who d'you love
Who d'you love, who d'you love?
Who d'you love, who d'you love, who d'you love
Who d'you love, who d'you love?
Who d'you love, who d'you love, who d'you love
Who d'you love, who'd you love, who d'you really love?
