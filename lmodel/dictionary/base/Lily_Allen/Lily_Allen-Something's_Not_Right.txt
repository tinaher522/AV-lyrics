<song artist="Lily_Allen" title="Something's_Not_Right">
Something's not right
Something's not right
We had forever
We never got it together
I waited for you
For you, I made it better
They kept telling me that it was unlikely
All I had to do is keep you beside me
Something's not right
'Cause there aren't many stars in the sky tonight
Something's not right
'Cause we know that it's day but it's dark outside
And I feel a weight in my heart tonight
We had forever
We never got it together
I waited for you
For you, I made it better
They kept telling me that it was unlikely
All I had to do is keep you beside me
Something's not right
'Cause there aren't many stars in the sky tonight
Something's not right
'Cause I know that it's day but it's dark outside
Like the feeling of rain on a summer light
