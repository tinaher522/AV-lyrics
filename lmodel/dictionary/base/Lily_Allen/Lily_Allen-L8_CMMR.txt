Good lover, good lover
Feels good like a long hot summer
Late comer, he’s a late comer
My man is a bad motherfucker
He can bring it, bring it all day long
All other man, them been wrong
Nobody will get to see
‘Cause he’s gonna spend his life with me
You can’t have him
No way, he’s taken ladies
I’ve got me his babies
Look at my ring
He’s going nowhere till this fat lady sings
And when I see his face
I feel like I can win the race
And when he calls, when he calls my name
I know we’re in the long game
Why would I leave him for?
I couldn’t ask for any more
I wouldn’t send, I wouldn’t send him back
He won me game, set, and match
(Late comer, he's a late comer)
My lover, my lover
Shoots and scores like he’s Maradona
Under cover, under the covers
My man is a bad motherfucker
Anybody, anyone could see
I’d have caught him eventually
Me and him have a thing that’s rare
Other girls can look elsewhere
You can’t have him
No way, he’s taken ladies
I’ve got me his babies
Look at my ring
He’s going nowhere till this fat lady sings
And when I see his face
I feel like I can win the race
And when he calls, when he calls my name
I know we’re in the long game
Why would I leave him for?
I couldn’t ask for any more
I wouldn’t send, I wouldn’t send him back
He won me game, set, and match
You can look girl but you can’t touch
Don’t know why I love him so much
Can’t put this thing into words
My love for him’s absurd
You can look girl but you can’t touch
Don’t know why I love him so much
Can’t put this thing into words
My love for him’s absurd
And when I see his face
I feel like I can win the race
And when he calls, when he calls my name
I know we’re in the long game
Why would I leave him for?
I couldn’t ask for any more
I wouldn’t send, I wouldn’t send him back
He won me game, set, and match
And when I see his face
I feel like I can win the race
And when he calls, when he calls my name
I know we’re in the long game
Why would I leave him for?
I couldn’t ask for any more
I wouldn’t send, I wouldn’t send him back
He won me game, set, and match
(Late comer, he's a late comer)
