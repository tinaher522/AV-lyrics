<song artist="Lily_Allen" title="Silver_Spoon">
So I went to posh school, why would I deny it?
Silver spoon at the ready so don’t even try it
Yeah, the house I grew up in, it was Georgian
Ten bedrooms, beautiful proportions
Can’t say that life isn’t easy
Double negative, can’t nothing please me?
Only made it here 'cause of my daddy
Fuck your teabags, yo where’s my tea caddy?
This life, that life
Life isn’t fair but we’re all gon’ try
Not fair, it’s not right
Doing my thing, I’m just keeping my head down and
Do we have to keep talking about where you think it is I’m from?
And I'ma make you see you don’t know me, you don’t know me
No, things never change, no, telling some people
I can not believe I’m still here, still telling you that you’re wrong
And are you losing sleep? You don’t know me, you don’t know me
No, things never change, no, telling some people
So I got a trust fund, so what am I doing?
Buying property, can’t be bothered with the viewings
I’m getting hungry, could you fetch my butler?
Step back, I couldn’t be any humbler
Sucked dick, got signed to a major
I’ll do anything just to entertain ya
I’m from west eleven, and when it’s over
I’m going straight to heaven, in a Range Rover
This life, that life
Life isn’t fair but we’re all gon’ try
Not fair, it’s not right
Doing my thing, I’m just keeping my head down and
Do we have to keep talking about where you think it is I’m from?
And I'ma make you see you don’t know me, you don’t know me
No, things never change, no, telling some people
I can not believe I’m still here, still telling you that you’re wrong
And are you losing sleep? You don’t know me, you don’t know me
No, things never change, no, telling some people
You don’t know me, you don’t know me
No, things never change, no, telling some people
Round and round again
Please could you repeat the question?
Driving 'round the bend
I’ve heard it all before, and then some
Round and round again
Please could you repeat the question?
Doing my thing, I’m just keeping my head down and
Do we have to keep talking about where you think it is I’m from?
And I'ma make you see you don’t know me, you don’t know me
No, things never change, no, telling some people
I can not believe I’m still here, still telling you that you’re wrong
And are you losing sleep? You don’t know me, you don’t know me
No, things never change, no, telling some people
And I'ma make you see you don’t know me, you don’t know me
No, things never change, no telling some people
And are you losing sleep? You don’t know me, you don’t know me
No, things never change, no telling some people
And I'ma make you see you don’t know me, you don’t know me
No, things never change, no telling some people
