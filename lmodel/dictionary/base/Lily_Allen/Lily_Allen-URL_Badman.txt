<song artist="Lily_Allen" title="URL_Badman">
I work at home in my parents’ basement
I don’t troll, I make statements
I’m not a cliche sittin’ in my PJ’s
Double cupping at lunch on a Tuesday
I’m like Drake, see, so don’t hate me!
I get vexed if you don’t appreciate me
Real talk, I put the world to rights
And when I’m a big boy I’m gonna write for Vice
It’s not for me, it must be wrong
I could ignore it and move on
But I’m a Broadband Champion, a URL badman
And if you’re trying to call it art
I’ll have to take it all apart
I got a highbrow game plan, a URL badman
I’m a URL B-A-D-M-A-N with no empathy
I got a highbrow game plan, a URL Badman
I’m a URL B-A-D-M-A-N and you’re dead to me
Because I’m a Broadband Champion, a URL Badman
Spectacles with no prescription
Short-shorts with conviction
Supreme palace, APC
Sizzurp in a chalice, yeah, that’s so me
I’m a London white boy repping ATL
Keyboard Warrior that can’t spell
I don’t like you, I think you’re worthless
I wrote a long piece about it up on my WordPress
It’s not for me, it must be wrong
I could ignore it and move on
But I’m a Broadband Champion, a URL Badman
And if you’re trying to call it art
I’ll have to take it all apart
I got a highbrow game plan, a URL Badman
I’m a URL B-A-D-M-A-N with no empathy
I got a highbrow game plan, a URL Badman
I’m a URL B-A-D-M-A-N and you’re dead to me
'Cause I’m a Broadband Champion, a URL Badman
I like Jordans, Joyrich, DJ’s screw shit
Complex, Pitchfork, Winnie the Pooh shit
I’m a space ghost perpetrator, bottom half of idolator
Check for Tyler the Creator, blogespheric vindicator
A$AP, Kanye, XX remix
Mike Jones, Paul Wall, I need a Kleenex
I don’t like girls much, they’re kinda silly
Unless of course they want to play with my willy
I’m a URL B-A-D-M-A-N with no empathy
I got a highbrow game plan, a URL Badman
I’m a URL B-A-D-M-A-N and you’re dead to me
'Cause I’m a Broadband Champion, a URL Badman
I got a highbrow game plan, a URL Badman
