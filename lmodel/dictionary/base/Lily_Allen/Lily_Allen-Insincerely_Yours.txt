<song artist="Lily_Allen" title="Insincerely_Yours">
What's going on in the magazines?
It's the same damn thing in every one
I don't give a fuck about the Delevingne
Or that Rita girl, about Jourdan Dunn
I don't wanna know about your perfect life
You're a perfect wife and it makes me sick
I don't give a fuck about your Instagram
About your lovely house or your ugly kids
I'm not your friend and I can't pretend
I ain't being funny, funny
Let's be clear, I'm here
I'm here to make money, money, money
If I force a smile, I can make it worthwhile
Don't touch me, honey, honey
Let's be clear, I'm here
I'm here to make money, money, money
Insincere, insincerely yours tonight
Let's be clear, I'm here
I'm here to make money, money, money
We're all here, we're all here 'cause the price is right
Let's be clear, I'm here
I'm here to make money, money, money
Whatever happened to the real DJs?
'Cause the chick you've paid can't mix the shit
She's looking good with her headphones on
With her Beats by Dre, she's so legit
I see pictures of her all the time
On the Mail Online, she's everywhere
Does anybody know what she does?
Do you know her name, do you really care?
I'm not your friend and I can't pretend
I ain't being funny, funny
Let's be clear, I'm here
I'm here to make money, money, money
If I force a smile, I can make it worthwhile
Don't touch me, honey, honey
Let's be clear, I'm here
I'm here to make money, money, money
Insincere, insincerely yours tonight
Let's be clear, I'm here
I'm here to make money, money, money
We're all here, we're all here 'cause the price is right
Let's be clear, I'm here
I'm here to make money, money, money
I've never been one to moan
You're doing in my head now
Doing in my head, doing in my head, doing in my head
Won't somebody take me home?
I'm ready for my bed now
Ready for my bed, ready for my bed, ready for my bed
Insincere, insincerely yours tonight
Let's be clear, I'm here
I'm here to make money, money, money
We're all here, we're all here 'cause the price is right
Let's be clear, I'm here
I'm here to make money, money, money
Let's be clear, I'm here
I'm here to make money, money, money
Let's be clear, I'm here
I'm here to make money, money, money
