<song artist="Lily_Allen" title="Not_Big">
Now listen I think you and me have come to the end of our time
What'd you want, some kind of reaction?
Well okay that's fine
Alright how would it make you feel if I said you never ever made me cum?
In the year and a half that we spent together
Yeah, I never really had much fun
All of the times that I said I was sober
Well I'm afraid I lied
I'd be lying next to you, you next to me
All the while I was high as a kite
I could see it in your face as you break it to me gentle
Yeah you really must think you're great
Well let's see how you feel in a couple of weeks
When I work my way through your mates
I never wanted it to end up this way
You've only got yourself to blame
I'm gonna tell them that you're rubbish in bed now
And that you're small in the game
I saw you thought this was gonna be easy
Well, you're outta luck
Yeah let's rewind let's turn back time -- to when you couldn't get it up
You know what? It should'a ended there
That's when I should'a shown you the door
As if that weren't enough to deal with
You became premature
I'm sorry if you feel that I'm being kinda mental
But you left me in such a state
Now I'm gonna do to you what you did to me
Gonna reciprocate
I never wanted it to end up this way
You've only got yourself to blame
I'm gonna tell them that you're rubbish in bed now
And that you're small in the game
You're not big, you're not clever
No you ain't a big bedder
Not big whatsoever
You're not big, you're not clever
No you aren't a big bedder
Not big whatsoever
I'm sorry if you feel that I'm being kinda mental
But you left me in such a state
Now I'm gonna do what you did to me
Gonna reciprocate
I never wanted it to end up this way
You've only got yourself to blame
I'm gonna tell them that you're rubbish in bed now
And that you're small in the game
You're not big you're not clever
no you ain't a big bedder
Not big whatsoever
You're not big you're not clever
Not big whatsoever
No you ain't a big bedder
