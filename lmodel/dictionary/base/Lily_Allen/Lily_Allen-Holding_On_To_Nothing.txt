<song artist="Lily_Allen" title="Holding_On_To_Nothing">
Sometimes I see his face
I want to hold you but it feels unsafe
Too scared to give me heart up now
I'm not brave enough to play my part now
Can you guarantee that you'll stay
Here with me, with me?
Feels strange like a foreign thing
I'm still waiting for the love to kick in
Sometimes when I watch you sleeping
I keep havin' to check you're breathing
(I), it's not fair, (can't), not your fault
(Feel), not you fault, (a), not at all
(Thing), not at all
I'm once bitten, twice shy
I try and I try, I try
'Cause I'm holding on to nothing
I'm holding on to nothing
Once bitten, twice shy
I can't seem to find the strength
What's the point in keeping you at arm's length?
I want to love you but I can't imagine
What I'd do if the worst did happen
(I), can you, (can't), guarantee
(Feel), that you'll stay, (a), here with me
(Thing), with me?
I'm once bitten, twice shy
I try and I try, I try
'Cause I'm holding on to nothing
I'm holding on to nothing
Once bitten, twice shy
Well I've been there before
No I won't go back
Couldn't take anymore
I'm not going back
Going back, going back
I'm once bitten, twice shy
I try and I try, I try
'Cause I'm holding on to nothing
I'm holding on to nothing
Once bitten, twice shy
(Once bitten, twice shy)
