<song artist="Lily_Allen" title="Mr._Blue_Sky">
Sun is shinin' in the sky
There ain't a cloud in sight
It's stopped rainin'
Ev'rybody's in a play
And don't you know?
It's a beautiful new day
Hey, hey, hey
Runnin' down the avenue
See how the sun shines
Brightly in the city
On the streets
Where once was pity
Mr. Blue Sky
Is living here today
Hey, hey, hey
Mr. Blue Sky
Please tell us why
You had to hide away for so long
Where did we go wrong?
Mr. Blue Sky
Please tell us why
You had to hide away for so long
Where did we go wrong?
Hey, you with the pretty face
Welcome to the human race
A celebration
Mr. Blue Sky's up there waitin'
And today is the day we've waited for
Ho, oh, oh
Mr. Blue Sky
Please tell us why
You had to hide away for so long
Where did we go wrong?
Hey there, Mr. Blue
We're so pleased to be with you
Look around, see what you do
Everybody smiles at you
Hey there, Mr. Blue
We're so pleased to be with you
Look around, see what you do
Everybody smiles at you
Mr. Blue Sky
Mr. Blue Sky
Mr. Blue Sky
Mr. Blue, you did it right
But soon comes Mr. Night
Creepin' over
Now his hand is on your shoulder
Never mind
I'll remember you this
I'll remember you this
Mr. Blue Sky
Please tell us why
You had to hide away for so long
Where did we go wrong?
Mr. Blue Sky
Please tell us why
You had to hide away for so long
Where did we go wrong?
Hey there, Mr. Blue
We're so pleased to be with you
Look around, see what you do
Everybody smiles at you
