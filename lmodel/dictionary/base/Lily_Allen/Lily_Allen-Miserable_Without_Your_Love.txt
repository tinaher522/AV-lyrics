<song artist="Lily_Allen" title="Miserable_Without_Your_Love">
I'm a beautiful (beautiful)
Powerful (powerful)
Fashionable (best dressed)
Animal
But I'm miserable without your love
Miserable without your love
I am miserable without your love
Miserable without your love
Tell me I'm brilliant and talented
And that I'm the best
And do you think I've still got it
I think I've been depressed
There's no more free shit
My packages
My ten trips to the lemon trees
My handbags, my pieces
I felt your words beneath me
Please sir, do you want my picture
Do you want my address
Do you want my fame
Do you want my star
Do you want my beauty
Do you want my power
Do you want my number
Do you want my love
I'm a beautiful (beautiful)
Powerful (powerful)
Fashionable (best dressed)
Animal
But I'm miserable without your love
Miserable without your love
I am miserable without your love
Miserable without your love
Sometimes I think to myself
That I might have got it all
The path I've chosen
Might not be the one I should be on
I can't get enthusiastic
About a shit load of plastic
I thought that would be easy
I thought it would complete me
But I want my evenings
And I want my girlfriends
And I want my peace
And I want my drugs
And I want my figure
And I want my glamour
And I want my life back
Where you're mine
I'm a beautiful (beautiful)
Powerful (powerful)
Fashionable (best dressed)
Animal
But I'm miserable without your love
Miserable without your love
I am miserable without your love
Miserable without your love
If I lay down
What would I be
What if I stopped
Would you like me
What have I done
Would you show me
How I lost my grip
Will you stand by me
I'm a beautiful (beautiful)
Powerful (powerful)
Fashionable (best dressed)
Animal
But I'm miserable without your love
Miserable without your love
I am miserable without your love
Miserable without your love
