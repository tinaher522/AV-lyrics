<song artist="Lily_Allen" title="U_Killed_It">
Sunday morning
We were lying in bed just the two of us under cover
Under cover
With no warning
You suddenly became more than my lover(-a-a-ahh)
I've been waiting so very long for you to say it to me
Say it to me
I'd be skating
Skating on thin ice if I don't agree(-e-e-eee)
I know that you're the one for me
But it took me by surprise
And if I say it back to you
I can't look you in the eye
But I don't want to lose you
And I don't want to confuse you
I guess that this my cue to give you my reply
And you killed it
You killed it
You killed it with I love you
And you killed it
You killed it
You killed it with I love you
And you killed it with I love you
What am I supposed to say back to you
And you killed it with I love you, with I love you
I know it's only
Only three little words that I seem to be so scared of
I'm so scared of
So please show me
How to get these words off the tip of my tongue and out of my mind.
I know that you're the one for me but it took me by surprise
But if I say it back to you
I can't look you in the eye
But I don't want to lose you
And I don't want to confuse you
I guess that this my cue to give you my reply
And you killed it
You killed it
You killed it with I love you
And you killed it
You killed it
You killed it with I love you
I have been thinking about what you said
Three little words running round in my head
There's no one else that I'd rather be next to
I guess what I'm trying to say is I love you
And you killed it
You killed it
You killed it with I love you
And you killed it
You killed it
You killed it with I love you
