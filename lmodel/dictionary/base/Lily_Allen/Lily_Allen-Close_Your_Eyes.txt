<song artist="Lily_Allen" title="Close_Your_Eyes">
Hey-hey, hey-hey
Baby, baby, I have to say this
There’s something you should know
When I’m standing there in my underwear
I know that I’ve let myself go
But I still feel sexy when you undress me
And whisper in my ear
Come over here, come over here
Let’s spice it up, you can dress me up
I’ll be anyone you like
Get my leathers on, yeah, let’s get it on
Come on, ride me like a bike
I’ll be Beyoncé, baby, say my name
Tonight you’re on my Hova
Baby come over, baby come over
Close your eyes, baby take off your shirt
I'ma just hit the lights, come on, let me get to work
I’m gonna hypnotise you, then I’m gonna yank your chain
And we can do it again, all over again
Driving your Sedan up to my mini van
I see you in my mirror
Ain’t no other chick gonna cop my shit
You know I’d have to kill her
You know how to use it, I’m ’bout to lose it
You blow my fucking mind
Park it right up behind, park it right up behind
Close your eyes, baby take off your shirt
I'ma just hit the lights, come on, let me get to work
I’m gonna hypnotise you, then I’m gonna yank your chain
And we can do it again, all over again
Where'd you learn to do the things you do?
You’re everything, you’re all my dreams come true
You know your way around like no one else
You’re right there like you care
You’re so close I’m nearly there, ooh yeah!
Come on now baby yeah
Come on now baby yeah, come on baby right there
Come on baby now yeah
Come on baby oh yeah, come on baby not there
Come on baby right there
Close your eyes, baby take off your shirt
I'ma just hit the lights, come on, let me get to work
I’m gonna hypnotise you, then I’m gonna yank your chain
And we can do it again, all over again
Close your eyes, baby take off your shirt
I'ma just hit the lights, come on, let me get to work
I’m gonna hypnotise you, then I’m gonna yank your chain
And we can do it again, all over again
