<song artist="Lily_Allen" title="As_Long_As_I_Got_You">
It seems like only yesterday you were with somebody else
Soon as it was over, though, I had claimed you for myself
Didn’t take me long before I had moved my stuff to yours
Glad to leave the past behind and I’m glad to close the door
Because you know I love ya
Because you know I love ya
So far has been so good and it seems that we stand the test of time
You never call me baby but you refer to me as mine
What I like the best is how you can keep me on my toes
Staying home with you is better than sticking things up my nose
I had that awful feeling that I needed help
My life had lost its meaning but you saved me from myself
As long as I’ve got you and we can be
Together and forever just you and me, well that’s swell
You sleep with your mouth wide open and you go to the pub alone
You only cook from frozen but I don’t ever hear you moan
You let me lie in bed when you’re doing breakfast with the kids
Landing on my feet with you, I’m so happy this is how we live
Because you know I love ya
Because you know I love ya
I had that awful feeling that I needed help
My life had lost its meaning but you saved me from myself
As long as I’ve got you and we can be
Together and forever just you and me, well that’s swell
I had that awful feeling that I needed help
My life had lost its meaning but you saved me from myself
As long as I’ve got you and we can be
Together and forever just you and me, well that’s swell
As long as I’ve got you and we can be
Together and forever just you and me, well that’s swell
As long as I’ve got you and we can be
Together and forever just you and me, well that’s swell
