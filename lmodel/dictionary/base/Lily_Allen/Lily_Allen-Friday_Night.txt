<song artist="Lily_Allen" title="Friday_Night">
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Friday night, last orders at the pub
Get in the car and drive to the club
There's a massive crowd outside so we get into the queue
It's quarter past eleven now, we won't get in 'till quarter two
It's quarter two and we get to the front
Girl on the guest list dressed like a...
She asked security to check inside my shoes
You can play this game with me, but you know you're gonna lose
Looked me up and down
I don't make a sound
There's a lesson that I want you to learn
It's if you're gonna play with fire
Then you're gonna get burned
Don't try and test me 'cos you'll get a reaction
Another drink and I'm ready for action
I don't know who you think you are
But making people scared won't get you very far
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
In the club, make our way to the bar
Good dancing love, but you should have worn a bra
Guy on the mic and he's making too much noise
There's these girls in the corner want attention from the boys
I see these girls and they're shouting through the crowd
Don't understand why they're being really loud
Make their way over to me and try and push me out the way
I push her back, she looks at me and says, "What you tryn'a say?"
Looked me up and down
I don't make a sound
There's a lesson that I want you to learn
It's if you're gonna play with fire
Then you're gonna get burned
Don't try and test me 'cos you'll get a reaction
Another drink and I'm ready for action
I don't know who you think you are
But making people scared won't get you very far
Don't try and test me 'cos you'll get a reaction
Another drink and I'm ready for action
I don't know who you think you are
But making people scared won't get you very far
