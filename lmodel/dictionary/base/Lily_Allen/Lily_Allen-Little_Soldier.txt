<song artist="Lily_Allen" title="Little_Soldier">
So come on over
What you waiting for?
No strings attached
No, you won't be ignored
We could be family
You'll be comfortable
Ever expanding
Fully functional
You won't have to answer to anyone
You will always have the room to breathe
We worship and have some fun
We are the well-intentioned
We only fight in the name of peace
So come on over
What you waiting for?
No strings attached
No, you won't be ignored
We could be family
You'll be comfortable
Ever expanding
Fully functional
Don't worry, it's safe at last
There's nothing to overthink
Forget tomorrow, forget the past
When you go over to bed
I know you'll be able to get some sleep
So come on over
What you waiting for?
No strings attached
No, you won't be ignored
We could be family
You'll be comfortable
Ever expanding
Fully functional
No strings attached
No, you won't be ignored
