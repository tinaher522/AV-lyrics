<song artist="Lily_Allen" title="Life_For_Me">
When the day’s over and I have a second to myself
I lie on the sofa watching TV
Get on the computer and start checking up on everyone else
On everyone else
Looking at all the pictures, up to all sorts of mischief
Some of them are ridiculous, everything’s there to see
Everyone looks so wasted, totally off their faces
I feel so isolated, everyone there but me
Why does it feel like I’m missing something?
Been there and done that and it’s good for nothing
Everything’s perfect, yeah, I’m as content as can be
This is the life for me (This is the life for me, yeah)
Tell me I’m normal for feeling like this
It’s a bit early for a midlife crisis
Everything’s perfect, yeah, I’m as content as can be
This is the life for me (This is the life for me, yeah)
I’m not complaining but last night I hardly slept at all
Well, actually, yes, I am complaining
No energy left in me, the baby might have taken it all
'Cause I’ve hit the wall
Please don’t think I’m being rude, honey I’m just not in the mood
I’m head to toe in baby food, so please will you give it a rest
It’s not that I don’t love you and it’s not that I don’t want to
Honestly baby to tell you the truth, I feel like a bit of a mess
Why does it feel like I’m missing something?
Been there and done that and it’s good for nothing
Everything’s perfect, yeah, I’m as content as can be
This is the life for me (This is the life for me, yeah)
Tell me I’m normal for feeling like this
It’s a bit early for a midlife crisis
Everything’s perfect, yeah, I’m as content as can be
This is the life for me (This is the life for me, yeah)
I can never get bored of it and most of the time I love this
But sometimes I get nostalgic when actually I’m complete
Why does it feel like I’m missing something?
Been there and done that and it’s good for nothing
Everything’s perfect, yeah, I’m as content as can be
This is the life for me (This is the life for me, yeah)
Tell me I’m normal for feeling like this
It’s a bit early for a midlife crisis
Everything’s perfect, yeah, I’m as content as can be
This is the life for me (This is the life for me, yeah)
Everything’s perfect, yeah, I’m as content as can be
This is the life for me (This is the life for me, yeah)
