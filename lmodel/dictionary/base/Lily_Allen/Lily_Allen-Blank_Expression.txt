<song artist="Lily_Allen" title="Blank_Expression">
Snow is falling all around
Seven o'clock and the roads are blocked
So i walk downtown
There's no one else around
I look in the bar and immediately
I sense *daydream*
Look at me girl as if i was some kind of
A total stranger
Where did you get that
Blank expression on your face?
Where did you get that
Blank expression on your face?
The streets are dark
And there's no one about
I wander home
And all the lights are out
I keep wondering
Where did you get that
Blank expression on your face?
Where did you get that
Blank expression on your face?
Where did you get that
Blank expression on your face?
Where did you get that
Blank expression on your face?
