<song artist="Lily_Allen" title="Wind_Your_Neck_In">
Why don’t you keep your eyes on the road?
Keep yourself to yourself or you’re gonna explode.
Don’t concern yourself with my shit,
If I told you the truth well you probably couldn’t handle it.
What’s it got to do with you?
I don’t care what you get up to.
Didn’t ask for your opinion,
Not your business - wind your neck in.
Why’d you think you’re better?
Little rubber necker,
No one likes a troublemaker, pull up your socks.
There’s nothing to see here,
Why’d you have to be here?
Can’t you turn around and get back into your box?
Wind your neck in.
Wind your neck in, wind, wind, wind, wind your neck in.
Wind your neck in, wind, wind, wind, wind.
Wind your neck in, wind, wind, wind, wind your neck in.
Wind your neck in, wind, wind, wind, wind.
I’ve always said "each to their own",
Won’t you give me a break won’t you throw me a bone?
I’m a different kettle of fish,
If you don’t understand just look the other way -
I’ll do my thing, you do yours,
What you get up to behind closed doors
Not of interest, I’ve no opinion,
It’s not my business - wind your neck in.
Why’d you think you’re better?
Little rubber necker,
No one likes a troublemaker, pull up your socks.
There’s nothing to see here,
Why’d you have to be here?
Can’t you turn around and get back into your box?
Wind your neck in.
Wind your neck in, wind, wind, wind, wind your neck in.
Wind your neck in, wind, wind, wind, wind.
Wind your neck in, wind, wind, wind, wind your neck in.
Wind your neck in, wind, wind, wind, wind.
Down, (down), the rubber neckers slow me down,
When will they ever work it out, (out)?
No, they can’t run me out of town.
Wind your neck in.
Why’d you think you’re better?
Little rubber necker,
No one likes a troublemaker, pull up your socks.
There’s nothing to see here,
Why’d you have to be here?
Can’t you turn around and get back into your box?
Wind your neck in.
Wind your neck in, wind, wind, wind, wind your neck in.
Wind your neck in, wind, wind, wind, wind.
Wind your neck in, wind, wind, wind, wind your neck in.
Wind your neck in, wind, wind, wind, wind.
Wind your neck in, wind, wind, wind, wind your neck in.
Wind your neck in, wind, wind, wind, wind.
Wind your neck in, wind, wind, wind, wind your neck in.
Wind your neck in, wind, wind, wind, wind.
