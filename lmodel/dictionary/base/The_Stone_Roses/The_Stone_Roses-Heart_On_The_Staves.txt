<song artist="The_Stone_Roses" title="Heart_On_The_Staves">
You act the part
You play the game
Ride on my airwaves
And that's where I come in
Nothin' for nothin'
You ride on an airwaves
Oh so typical
Yeah yeah you're on my airwaves
You're so creative
Yet you've left you're heart on the stave
You left it on the stave
Oh
Heart on the stave oh
Heart on the stave oh
You act the part
Don't play the game
Ride on my airwaves
And that's where we come in
Nothin' for nothin'
You ride on our airwaves
Oh so typical
Yeah we're on the airwaves
Oh
Heart on the stave oh
We don't make mistakes oh
Where's your heart
Where's your heart
It's up on the stave
We all make mistakes
