Dirty linen's on public display
This fox is a vulture, make no mistake
The day is long gone when I succumb to this
End of my day, nothin' but rage
He'll cut your face off, I'll sooner say hello
He'll cut your face, I'll sooner say hello
I cut your face off, I'll sooner say hello
I'll cut your face
I'll sooner say, I'll sooner say, I'll sooner say
Hello
Dirty linen's on public display
No I need no excuse, up and away
Trust me, trust a fox, a silly thing to do
I want the blood of an Englishman
He'll cut your face off, I'll sooner say hello
I'll cut your face, I'll sooner say hello
He'll cut your face off, I'll sooner say hello
I cut your face
I'll sooner say, I'll sooner say, I'll sooner say
Hello
HaÂ !
I'll cut your face off, I'll sooner say hello
I cut your face, I'll sooner say hello
I'll cut your face off, I'll sooner say hello
I cut your face
I'll sooner say, I'll sooner say, I'll sooner say
Hello
I'll sooner say hello, I'll sooner say hello
I'll sooner say hello, I'll sooner say hello
He'll cut your face off, I'll sooner say hello
He cut your face, I'll sooner say hello
I'll cut your face off, I'll sooner say hello
I cut your face
I'll sooner say, I'll sooner say, I'll sooner say
Hello
