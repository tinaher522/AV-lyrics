<song artist="The_Stone_Roses" title="Here_It_Comes">
I'm not so sure and yet I know
Give me your life
It's worthless anyhow
And worthless comes 
I'm not so tall
As I like to think I am
Though I'll be found
Forever in your pain
And here it comes 
I'd rather be no one than someone with no one
I'd rather be no one than someone with no one
No one to love
