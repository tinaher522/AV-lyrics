<song artist="The_Stone_Roses" title="Ride_On">
Way down deep dark and funky
Tie me tightly to your bed
Ride on, lady, I'm your monkey
Yes, the organ grinder's getting wet
Oh you're still filthy dragged on the sand of another mans land
Another man riding on another man's dream
If I call on our beautiful
I may issue
I don't want to miss you
I don't want to diss you
I don't want to miss you
But you're on my list, you
I put you on my list, you
Way down deep dark and funky
Tie me tightly to your bed
Ride on, lady, I'm your monkey
Yes, the organ grinder's getting wet
You're still filthy dragged on the sand of another mans land
Another man riding on another man's dream
Singing for doorways and begging for light
My lock hears the strike
It's alright
It's just I caught you playing with the light
I may issue
I don't want to miss you
Not going to miss you
I don't want to miss you
I put you on my list, you
I put you on my list, you
If I call on our beautiful
I may issue
I don't want to miss you
I come here to bliss you
I don't want to miss you
I put you on my list, you
I put you on my list, you
