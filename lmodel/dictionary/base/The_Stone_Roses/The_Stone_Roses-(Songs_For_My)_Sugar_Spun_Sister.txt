<song artist="The_Stone_Roses" title="(Songs_For_My)_Sugar_Spun_Sister">
Her hair, soft drifted snow
Death white, I'd like to know
Why she hates all that she does
But she gives it all that she's got
Until the sky turns green
The grass is several shades of blue
Every member of parliament trips on glue
Until the sky turns green
And the grass is several shades of blue
Every member of parliament trips on glue
It takes all these things and all that time
Till my sugar spun sister's happy
With this love of mine
It'll take all these things and, oh, much more
I've paid for fifteen or more
But my guts can't take many more
My hands are stuck to my jeans
And she knows, she knows
What this must mean
She wakes up with the sun
She asked me what is all the fuss
As she gave me more than she thought she should
She wakes up with the sun
I think what have I done
As I gave her more than I thought I would, ohh
At takes all these things and all that time
Till my sugar spun sister's happy
With this love of mine
Yeah, yeah, yeah
The candy floss girl
The sticky fingered boy
Oh, that sister of mine, yeah
