<song artist="The_Stone_Roses" title="Waterfall">
Chimes sing Sunday morn. Today's the day she's sworn
To steal what she never could own, and race from this hole she calls home
Now you're at the wheel, tell me how, how does it feel?
So good to have equalised, to lift up the lids of your eyes
As the miles they disappear see land begin to clear
Free from the filth and the scum, this American satellite's won
She'll carry on through it all, she's a waterfall
She'll carry on through it all, she's a waterfall
See the steeple pine, the hills as old as time
Soon to be put to the test, to be whipped by the winds of the west
Stands on shifting sands, the scales held in her hands
The wind it just whips her and wails, and fills up her brigantine sails
She'll carry on through it all, she's a waterfall
She'll carry on through it all, she's a waterfall
