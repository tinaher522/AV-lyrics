<song artist="The_Stone_Roses" title="Just_A_Little_Bit">
You're thinking 'bout your money
You're careering off the track
You're too busy doing nothing
You don't see that it won't last
When you're strung across the age gap
All your friends been down the drain
And your prone to that old cliche
If I could only have my time again
Hand after handout
Where's your self-respect?
Your wardrobe's all second handed
Where's your magic now?
Think you're the Artful Dodger
You can only dodge for so long
And when Fagin pulls your plug out
You wonder what went wrong
Hand after handout
Where's your self-respect?
Your wardrobe's all second handed
Where's your magic now?
There's no way back, there's no way back, no way back
Just a little bit, Just a little bit
When you're strung across the age gap
All your friends been down the drain
And you're prone to that old cliche
If I could only have my time again
Hand after handout
Where's your self-respect?
Your wardrobe's all second handed
Where's your magic now?
Nowhere fast, nowhere fast
Just a little bit, just a little bit
Woo!
