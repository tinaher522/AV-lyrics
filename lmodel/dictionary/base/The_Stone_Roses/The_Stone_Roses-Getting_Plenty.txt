<song artist="The_Stone_Roses" title="Getting_Plenty">
And I'm not going down
Oh you'll not have me now
You cannot drag me down
So easy to approach me
I only keep with cut-throats
You think I'm only joking around
That I'm holier than though
And you'll not have me now
You make a bee-line for me
What I say must mean something
And I can't turn my back on the world
Cos I've got to put it straight
And I don't wanna wait
You're draggin' me, draggin' me down
Take me down
Show me around
But don't have me now
Cos I'm nobody now
You cannot help us now
You will not drag me down
You can have me whenever you want me
You're draggin' me, draggin' me down
Take me down, show me around
But don't drag me down
Cos I'm nobody now
You cannot help us now
You will not drag me down
You can have me whenever you want me
You can have me whenever you want me
Whenever you want me, whenever you want me
Whenever you want me
You can have me whenever you want
Whenever you want
You can have me whenever you want me
You can have me whenever you want me
Cos I'll get it one day
I'll get it one day
Whenever you want me
You can have me whenever you want
Brrrrrrum!
