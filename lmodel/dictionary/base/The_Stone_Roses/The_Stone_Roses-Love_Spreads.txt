<song artist="The_Stone_Roses" title="Love_Spreads">
Love spreads her arms, waits there for the nails
I forgive you boy, I will prevail
Too much to take, some cross to bear
I'm hiding in the trees with a picnic, she's over there, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
She didn't scream, she didn't make a sound
I forgive you boy, but don't leave town
Coal-black skin, naked in the rain
Hammer flash in the lightning
They're hurting her again
Oh
Let me put you in the picture
Let me show you what I mean
The Messiah is my sister
Ain't no king, man, she's my queen 
Let me put you in the picture
Let me show you what I mean
The Messiah is my sister
Ain't no king, man, she's my queen
I have a dream, I've seen the light
Don't put it out, yeah, she's alright
Yeah, she's my sister
She didn't scream, she didn't make a sound
I forgive you boy, but don't leave town
Coal-black skin, naked in the rain
Hammer flash in the lightning
They're hurting her again
Oh oh
Oh, huh
Oh oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Let me put you in the picture
Let me show you what I mean
The Messiah is my sister
Ain't no king, man, she's my queen
Let me put you in the picture
Let me show you what I mean
The Messiah is my sister
Ain't no king, man, she's my queen
Let me put you in the picture
Let me show you what I mean
The Messiah is my sister
Ain't no king, man, she's my queen
Let me put you in the picture
Let me show you what I mean
The Messiah is my sister
Ain't no king, man, she's my queen
Let me put you in the picture
Let me show you what I mean
The Messiah is my sister
Ain't no king, man, she's my queen
Let me put you in the picture
Let me show you what I mean
The Messiah is my sister
Ain't no king, man, she's my queen
Let me put you in the picture
Let me show you what I mean
The Messiah is my sister
Ain't no king, man, she's my queen
Let me put you in the picture
Let me show you what I mean
The Messiah is my sister
Ain't no king, man, she's my queen
I have a dream, I've seen the light
Don't put it out, yeah, she's alright 
Yeah, she's my sister
