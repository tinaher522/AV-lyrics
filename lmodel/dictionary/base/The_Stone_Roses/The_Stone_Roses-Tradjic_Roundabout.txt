<song artist="The_Stone_Roses" title="Tradjic_Roundabout">
Witches, warlocks, and vulturemen too
Martin Luther had nothing on you
He had a dream, you'll have a baby, baby
Will you cope, I don't know, maybe
The CIA, in Mothercare
They'll screw you up cos you're not all there
I see submission in a million eyes 
Twittering women are still telling lies
And you're not so gifted at all, at all
Bitches basements all over the land
You're striking pulses with half dose in hand
You think you're righteous 'cause you're smoking some shit
And I'm the one that pays for it
You're not so gifted at all, at all
And we're not so gifted at all, at all
Woo!
And you're not so gifted at all, at all
And we're not so gifted at all, at all
Woo!
