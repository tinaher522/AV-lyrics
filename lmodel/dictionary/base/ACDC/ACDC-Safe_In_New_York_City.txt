<song artist="AC/DC" title="Safe_In_New_York_City">
Come on little baby, gimme your hand
Check out the high spots, the lay of the land
You don't need a rocket or a big limousine
Ooh come on over baby and I'll make you obscene
I feel safe in New York City
I feel safe in New York City
I feel safe in New York City
I feel safe in New York City
All over the city and down to the dives
Don't mess with this place, it'll eat you alive
Got a lip smackin' honey to soak up the jam
On top of the world, ma, ready to slam
I feel safe in New York City
I feel safe in New York City
I feel safe in New York City
I feel safe in New York City
I feel safe in New York City
I feel safe in New York City
I feel safe in New York City
I feel safe in New York City
Movin' all over like a jumpin' bean
Take a look at that thing in the tight ass jean
Comin' your way now, you may be in luck
Don't you fret, boy, she's ready to buck
I feel safe in New York City
I feel safe in New York City
I feel safe in New York City
I feel safe in New York City
I feel safe in New York City
I feel safe in New York City
I feel safe in New York City
I feel safe in New York City
I feel safe in New York City
I feel safe in New York City
I feel safe in New York City
New York, New York, New York
I feel safe in a cage in New York City
