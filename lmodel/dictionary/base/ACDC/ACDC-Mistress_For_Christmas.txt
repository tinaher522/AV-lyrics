<song artist="AC/DC" title="Mistress_For_Christmas">
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the day
I just can't wait till
Christmas time
When I can grope you in the hay
Easy come, easy go
Have a good time with lots of dough
Slippin' up high, slippin' down low
Love'm and leave'm on with the show
Listen, I like meaphoe in midd one glass  (or "female
form in minimal dress")
Money to spend with a capital "S"
Get a date with the woman in red
Wanna be in heaven with three in a bed
He got it, I want it
They got it, I can't have it
But I want it, it don't matter
She got it, but I can't get it
I want a mistress for Christmas
Easy come, easy go
Slippin' high, slippin' low
He got it, I want it
They got it, I can't have it
I want it, don't matter
She got it, and I can't get a -
Mistress for Christmas
You know what I'm talkinâ€™ about, haha
They're gonna send me down they're gonna send me down
I want the woman in red with
her body on my bed [at the bottom of my bed]
I can hear you coming down my smokestack
I wanna ride on your reindeer honey and ring the bells
