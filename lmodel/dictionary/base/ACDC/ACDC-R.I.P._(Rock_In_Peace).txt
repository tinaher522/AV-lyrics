<song artist="AC/DC" title="R.I.P._(Rock_In_Peace)">
Aaaaaah
Leave me alone
Like a dog with a bone
Like a stone that's been thrown
Let me be on my own
Let me rock
Let me rock
Let me rock
Let me rock in peace
Outta my way
Got a boogie to play
Every dog has his day
Rock 'n' roll's here to stay
Let me rock
Let me roll
Let me rock
Let me rock in peace
Ohhh, feels good
Mama, mama
Just like I knew it would
I get my kicks
Outta playin' my licks
Outta layin' my chicks
Down on Route 66
Let me rock
Let me rock
Let me rock
Let me rock in peace
(Rock, rock, rock in peace) I wanna
(Rock, rock, rock in peace) Just let me rock
(Rock, rock, rock in peace) I wanna
(Rock, rock, rock in peace) I wanna rock
Let me rock in peace
Oooh, that feels good
Hey Mama
Just like I knew it would
Outta my way
Got a boogie to play
Every dog has his day
Rock 'n' roll's here to stay
Let me rock
Let me roll
Let me rock
Let me rock in peace
(Rock, rock, rock in peace) I wanna rock
(Rock, rock, rock in peace) I wanna rock
(Rock, rock, rock in peace) Ooh rock
(Rock, rock, rock in peace) I wanna rock
Let me rock in peace
(Rock, rock, rock in peace) Like Little Richard
(Rock, rock, rock in peace) Oh Jerry Lee
(Rock, rock, rock in peace) Aah Chuck baby, c'mon
(Rock, rock, rock in peace) I wanna rock
Let me rock in peace
