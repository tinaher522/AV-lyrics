<song artist="AC/DC" title="Danger">
Don't talk to strangers
Keep away from the danger, yeah yeah
Don't talk to strangers who smile
Keep away from the danger all the time, you just keep away, oh
Oh, just keep away
Red lights are flashing
There's been a misunderstanding, yeah yeah
I'm bruised and broke and bandaged
Through drinking all that brandy
I was under the table but I came back for more
Gotta hit that bottle but my head hit the floor, when I
Danger, danger, don't talk to strangers
Stranger, danger, don't you talk
Danger, danger, don't talk to strangers
Danger, danger, don't talk keep away
Red lights still flashing
People are still dancing in my head
I've done with thinking about what to do
Another bout of drinking, just one before I'm through
I was just raising hell I wasn't doing no harm
The cops could not appreciate my natural charm
I'm a danger, danger, don't talk to strangers
Stranger, danger, don't you talk, don't talk
Danger, danger, don't talk to strangers
Danger, danger, don't talk keep away
Don't talk to strangers
Danger, danger, don't talk to strangers
Stranger, danger, don't you talk, don't talk
Danger, danger , don't talk to strangers
Danger, danger , don't talk keep away
Danger, danger, don't talk to strangers
Stranger, danger, don't you talk, don't you talk
Danger, danger, don't talk to strangers
Danger, danger
Don't you go talking to no stranger in this town
