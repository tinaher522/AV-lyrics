<song artist="AC/DC" title="Night_Of_The_Long_Knives">
Who your leader? Who your man? 
Who will help you fill your hand? 
Who's your friend and who's your foe? 
Who's your Judas? You don't know 
Night of the long knives, night of the long knives
Night of the long knives, night of the long long knife 
Where's that saviour?
Where's that light when you're prayin' for your life? 
Who's that fightin' back to back? 
Who's defendin' who's attack? 
Night of the long knives, night of the long knives
Night of the long knives, night of the long long knife 
Night of the long knives
Oh stab him in the back once 
It's the night of the long knives, night of the long knives
Night of the long knives
It's the night of the long long knife
It's the night of the, night of the 
Night of the long long knife
