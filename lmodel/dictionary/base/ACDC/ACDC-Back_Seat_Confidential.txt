<song artist="AC/DC" title="Back_Seat_Confidential">
Old man's car, it's Saturday night
Got me a woman and I feel alright
Getting it on at the drive in show
Gonna sit in the back in the passion row.
Turn up the sound track, turn down the lights
There's a chance she wont, but there's a chance she might
Ain't no woman in the world I know
Ain't had her knickers on the automobile floor.
Whats that sound?
Somethings going down
You know whats going round
Back seat confidential.
Said to buy a rubber at the cigarette stand
But I'm dieing to get off so I can get it in
Doing my best to make a good connection
She said "what you gonna do about my protection?"
Alright momma gotta listen to me
Last chance thrill it's half past three
Huggin' and a kissin' would be real nice
Every man's got his price.
Whats that sound?
Somethings going down
You know whats going round
Back seat confidential.
Old man's car, it's Saturday night
Got me a woman and I feel alright
Getting it on at the drive in show
Gonna sit in the back in the passion row.
Turn up the sound track, turn down the lights
There's a chance she wont, but there's a chance she might
Ain't no woman in the world I know
Ain't had her knickers in the passion floor!
Whats that sound?
Somethings going down
You know whats going round
Back seat confidential.
Back seat confidential!!!!
