<song artist="AC/DC" title="Smoke_On_The_Water">
We all came down from Montraux, 
On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile, 
We didn't have much time
Frank Zeffer and among others,
Were at the best place around
Till some stupid with a flare gun
He burned the place to the ground
Smoke on the water,
Fire in the sky,
Smoke on the water
They burnt down the gamblin house,
It died with an awful sound
Funky claude was runin in and out,
Pullin' kids from the ground
When it all was over,
We had to find another place
Swiss time was runin out fast,
We're gona lose our race
Smoke on the water,
Fire in the sky,
Smoke on the water
We ended up at the grand hotel,
It was empty cold and bare
With the rolling truck stones just outside,
We made our music there
A few old red lights and a few old beds,
We made a place to sweat
Well no matter what we get out of this,
Well i know we'll never forget
Smoke on the water,
Fire in the sky,
Smoke on the water
