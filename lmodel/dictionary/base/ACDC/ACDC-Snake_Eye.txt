<song artist="AC/DC" title="Snake_Eye">
Yeah, yeah
You paint a picture
So it's plain to see
Ain't no hiding
No security
I'll be watching
Every move you make
When you hear the rattle
Better be awake
Snake eyes, watching
Snake eyes, look out
Snake eyes, oh it's coming
Snake eyes
Ain't no escaping from the snake eye
You leave a footprint
For my eye to see
Catch an echo
From a lock and key
From the shadow
Or behind a rock
Get you anywhere
From the darkest shack
Snake eyes, I'm watching
Snake eyes, look out
Snake eyes, ooh it's coming
Snake eyes
Ain't no escaping from the snake eye
Snake eyes
Snake eyes
Snake eyes
Snake eyes
Hear a rustle
From behind a tree
Get you running
Home to sanctuary
Bolt the door and
You think you're safe
I'm coming to get you
Gonna reach out, gonna get ya
Snake eyes, I'm watching
Snake eyes, look out
Snake eyes, it's coming
Snake eyes, ooh
Got the snake eyes, they
Call me a snake in the bush
Snake eyes, biting
Snake eyes, always watching
Snake eyes
Ain't no escaping from the -
Just keep a lookout for the
Snake eye
