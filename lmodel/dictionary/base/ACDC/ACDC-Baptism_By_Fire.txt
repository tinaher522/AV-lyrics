<song artist="AC/DC" title="Baptism_By_Fire">
Hey
Let's get the party started
And lady, do your tricks, ooh
Let's get the joint a-jumping
The boys need their kicks
We're gonna shock the nation
Make 'em flip their lids
You know you need a vacation
Ooh, bring along a bottle and enjoy the trip
I said ride, ride, ride
Up all night
Ride
It'll blow your mind
Baptism by fire
The rock and rolling tires  
Baptism by fire 
You spark a burning wire 
Play your hand
Come on and make a stand, hey
You hear the clap of thunder
Or feel her lightning spike, hey
You get your pistons firing
It's Lady Fortune's night
Ride, ride, ride
Up all night
Ride
It'll blow your mind
Baptism by fire
The rock and rolling tires
Baptism by fire
You feel the burning wire
Baptism by fire
Shooting high and shooting higher
Play your hand
Come on and play your hand
And let me show you how
Come on and make a stand
It'll blow your mind
Baptism by fire
Sweet, sweet desire
Baptism by fire
You're gonna burn wire
Baptism by fire
Shooting higher and shooting higher, yeah yeah yeah
