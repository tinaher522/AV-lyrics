Hey Mr. Business Man
Head of the company
Are you lookin' for a lady?
One who likes to please
Hey Mr. Business Man
This one likes to tease
With a special service
In the French qualities
But she won't sacrifice what you want tonight
She won't come across unless there's money in her hand
And she's callin' all the shots
She's Got you by the balls
She got you by the balls
She got you by the balls
She got you by the balls
She got you by the balls yeah
Hey Mr. Business Man
High society
She can play the school girl
And spank you all you please
But she won't sacrifice what you want tonight
She won't come across unless there's money in her hand
She don't go overtime
She got you by the balls (5x)
Got you by the balls
Hang it left, hang it right
Got you by the balls
Got your shorts, got your curlies
Gotcha!
By the balls
She got you by the balls (3x)
Yeah yeah she got you by the balls
She got you by the balls (4x)
