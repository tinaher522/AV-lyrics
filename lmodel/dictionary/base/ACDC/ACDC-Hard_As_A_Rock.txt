<song artist="AC/DC" title="Hard_As_A_Rock">
A rollin' rock, electric shocks
She gives a lickin' that don't stop
She line 'em up, push you 'round
Smokin' rings going round and round
Her hot potatoes
Will elevate you
Her bad behavior
Will leave you standing proud
Hard as a rock
Hard as a rock
Well, it's harder than a rock
Hard as a rock
Well, it's harder than a rock
The lightnin' rod, strike it hot
It's gonna hit you like the Rushmore rock
No nicotine, no pipe dreams
So low and dirty it's darn right mean
Hell elevator
Yeah, I'll see you later
No I ain't gonna take it
I'm busting out
I'm hard as a rock
Hard as a rock
Well, it's harder than a rock
Hard as a rock
Yes, it's harder than a rock, yeah
Hard as a rock
Harder than a rock
Hard as a rock
Yeah
I'm getting harder
Yeah
Yeah
(Harder than a rock)
Well, I'm harder than a rock
Hard as a rock
Babe, I'm harder than a rock, yeah
Hard as a rock
Well, it's harder than a rock
Hard as a rock
Yeah, it's harder than a rock, yeah
Hard as a rock
Well, I'm harder than a rock
Hard as a rock
Yes, I'm harder, harder, harder, harder than a rock
