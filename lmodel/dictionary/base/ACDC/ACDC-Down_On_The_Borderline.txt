<song artist="AC/DC" title="Down_On_The_Borderline">
Ooh, yeah
She's an idle child, high society
Never pushed a broom, not physically
Her eyes are down on you, her nose is up
Never spill your whiskey when she fill your cup
I'm on the borderline
On the borderline
She can spread them 'round and she shows them off
With a neon sign saying, "Don't you touch"
Between the devil and the deep blue sea
She use me like a anchor, get a hold on me
(On the borderline) she's a danger sign
(On the borderline) getting out of line
(On the borderline) but it feels so good
(On the borderline) on the borderline
On the borderline
Borderline
Here goes
You know I shoot the dice to claim my dream
You pull them in without a thought to me
She's come to watch you and your pocket is dry
The queen of hearts will kill you when the ace is high
On the borderline
On the borderline
She's an idle child, high society
Never pushed a broom, not physically
Her eyes are down on you, her nose is up
Never spill your whiskey when she fill your cup
(On the borderline) she's a danger sign
(On the borderline) getting out of line
(On the borderline) but it feels so good
(On the borderline) on the borderline
On the borderline, yeah
On the borderline
On the borderline
Borderline, gonna meet you there, oh yeah
On the borderline
On the borderline
On the borderline
On the borderline
If you want me, meet me on the borderline
