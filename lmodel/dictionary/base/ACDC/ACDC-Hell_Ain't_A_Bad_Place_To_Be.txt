<song artist="AC/DC" title="Hell_Ain't_A_Bad_Place_To_Be">
Hey you, yeah you
Sometimes I think this woman is kinda hot
Sometimes I think this woman is sometimes not
Puts me down, fool me around
Why she do it to me?
Out for satisfaction, any piece of action
That ain't the way it should be
She needs lovin', knows I'm the man
She's gotta see
Pours my beer, licks my ear
Brings out the devil in me
Hell ain't a bad place to be
Spends my money, drinks my booze
Stays out every night
But I got to thinkin', hey just a minute
Somethin' ain't right
All this disillusions and confusion
Make me wanna cry
Oh the shame, you playin' your games
Tellin' me those lies
Don't mind her playin' demon
Long as it's with me
If this is hell, then you could say
It's heavenly
Hell ain't a bad place to be
Late in the night, turns down the light
Closes up on me
Opens my heart, tears me apart
Brings out the devil in me
Hell ain't a bad place to be
I said hell ain't a bad place to be
Hell ain't a bad place to be
Hell ain't a bad place to be
