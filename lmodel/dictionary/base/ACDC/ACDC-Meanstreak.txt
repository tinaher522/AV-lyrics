<song artist="AC/DC" title="Meanstreak">
I've been to the left, I've been to the right
I've found myself in Abu Dhabi, just a mirage in the night
Been to the high, I've been to the low
And I've been to lots of places that I didn't wanna go
But I ain't see nothing to get me off my ass
And laughed at all the jokers wanting make me walk on glass
I could walk 'fore I could crawl
And I was meaner than a bad dog with his back against the wall
Animal, animal
Cannibal, cannibal
See 'em fall, see 'em fall
I'm the guy that they call
Meanstreak, I got a meanstreak
Meanstreak, they call me meanstreak
I just don't know who I wanna be
The count of Monte Cristo or the sheik of Arabia
I've eaten rich, and I've eaten free
I'm the perfect culture vulture in the face of poverty
And I ain't met no one who told me I got class
They say never feed the animal, the boy's got too much flash
I'm a guy they just can't teach
And I always kick the castle that's been built up on the beach
Animal, animal
Cannibal, cannibal
See 'em fall, see 'em fall
I'm the guy that they call
What's your name?
Meanstreak
