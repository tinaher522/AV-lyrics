<song artist="AC/DC" title="Whiskey_On_The_Rocks">
I've been drinkin' all night long
So long baby, I'm gone
Bloody Mary give me shivers from a shot
Set up the shooters, it's time for a drop
Old Jamaica, runnin we come
Down at the Hatch Jack, the women and the fun
We drink a lot , that demon drop
This one's on me , and here's to you
Whiskey on the rocks
A double or a shot
Whiskey on the rocks
Elixer from the top
Drikni Mai Tai, Singapore Sling
Beam me up Jim, it's time to come in
I'll have one more a'fore ye close up the door
It's on the house Mac, it's whiskey galore
We drink a lot , that demon drop
This one's on me , here's mud in your eye
Whiskey on the rocks
A double or a shot
Whiskey on the rocks
Elixir from the top
I'm drinkin
Whiskey on the rocks
Pour me a double here comes
Trouble in the rocks
Whiskey on the rocks
