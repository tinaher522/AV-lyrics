<song artist="AC/DC" title="Rock_Or_Bust">
Hey yeah
Are you ready?
We be a guitar band
We play across the land
Shootin' out tonight
Gonna keep you up alright
You hear the guitar sound
Playin' nice and loud
Rock you to your knees
Gonna make your destiny
In rock we trust, it's rock or bust
In rock we trust, it's rock or bust
In rock we trust, it's rock or bust
In rock and roll we trust, it's rock or bust
We hear the siren scream
It sounds so lean and mean
We like to shake it down
Know what we're talkin' 'bout
We turn the amps up high
The crowd's gonna hit the sky
We play it fast and loose
Because this night we're gonna pull a fuse
In rock we trust, it's rock or bust
In rock we trust, it's rock or bust
In rock we trust, it's rock or bust
In rock and roll we trust, it's rock or bust
In rock we trust, it's rock or bust
In rock we trust, it's rock or bust
In rock we trust, it's rock or bust
In rock we trust, it's rock or bust, that's right
