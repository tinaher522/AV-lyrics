<song artist="AC/DC" title="Overdose">
I never smoked me no cigarettes
I never drank much booze
But I'm only a man doncha understand
A man can sometimes lose
You gave me somethin' I never had
Pulled me down with you
Hit me up with a big hunka love
Hope you can pull me through
I overdosed on you
I overdosed on you
Crazy but it's true
Ain't nothin' I can do
I overdosed on you
Oh, woman you give to me
More than I can take
But listen honey, I don't mind
You're a habit I don't wanna break
Don't want me none of that harder stuff
Don't need it anymore
I'm in hell and I'm sinkin' fast
And I don't need no cure
I overdosed on you
I overdosed on you
Crazy but it's true
Ain't nothin' I can do
I overdosed on you
I was as happy as a man can be
Too far gone to save
Died of love and plenty of
Just write on my grave
I overdosed on you
I overdosed on you
Crazy but it's true
There's nothin' I can do
I overdosed on you, on you
On you, on you
All over you, all over you, all over
I overdosed, overdosed
Overdosed on you
Overdosed, aaaahhhh
