<song artist="AC/DC" title="Problem_Child">
I'm hot, and when I'm not
I'm cold as ice
Get out of my way, just step aside
Or pay the price
What I want I take, what I don't I break
And I don't want you
With a flick of my knife, I can change your life
There's nothing you can do
I'm a problem child
Problem child
I'm a problem child
Feel like running wild
Make my stand, no man's land
On my own
Man in blue, it's up to you
The seed is sown
What I want I stash, what I don't I smash
And you're on my list
Dead or alive, I got a .45
And I never miss
I'm a problem child
Problem child
I'm a problem child
Just feel like running wild
~(SOLO)~
Every night, street light
I drink my booze
Some run, some fight
But I win they lose
What I need I like, what I don't I fight
And I don't like you
Yeah, say bye-bye while you're still alive
Your time is through
Cause I'm a problem child
I'm a problem child
I'm a problem child
I'm a problem child
Problem child
I'm a problem child
Even my mother hates me
I'm a problem child
I'm a problem child
(Problem child, problem child)
(Problem child, problem child), ....
(Problem child, problem child)
(Problem child, problem child)
Problem child
I'm a problem child
Problem child
And I'm running wild
I'm a problem child
(Problem child, problem child...)
