<song artist="AC/DC" title="Spellbound">
Blinded by a bright beam
Shattered by the windscreen
Stunned by the whiplash
I'm a victim of a bad crash
I can do nothing right
I never sleep at night
Can't even start a fight
My feet have left the ground
Spinning round and round
Spellbound, my world keeps a tumbling down
Beaten by a blind man
Wrong way up a dead end
Screaming through a speed trap
As I tear into a tail pipe
I can do nothing right
I never sleep at night
Can't even start a fight
My feet have left the ground
Spinning round and round
Spellbound, my world keeps a tumbling down
I'm slipping down
I got my hands in the fire
I'm sliding on an oil slick
Blinded on a bad trip
Yes and nothing's going to change it
I can do nothing right
Can't even sleep at night
My feet have left the ground
I'm spinning round and round
Spellbound, my world keeps a tumbling down
