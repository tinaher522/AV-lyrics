<song artist="AC/DC" title="She_Likes_Rock_'N'_Roll">
A little game of falling down
You rock 'n' roll when the call come 'round
Come on baby, and make some time
Made in the shade and you wished it'd turn around
You're gonna rock, you'll roll the night away
You're gonna roll baby, and I'll make the grade
We gonna rock you now, rockin' and rollin' all in the town
You're gonna make it right, we're gonna need to rock all night
She digs rock 'n' roll
She likes rock 'n' roll
You want rock 'n' roll
I need rock 'n' roll everyday
And all through the night
We are a gang coming down
We're gonna rock all night, rockin' rollin' all the time
She may be home, rollin' out the groove
You know that rock and roll's squeezing out the tube
She digs rock 'n' roll
She likes rock 'n' roll
You want rock 'n' roll
And I need rock 'n' roll
Everyday and all through the night
She digs rock 'n' roll
She gives rock 'n' roll
She gives rock 'n' roll
I like rock 'n' roll
I gotta dance all night long
And rock into the room, yeah
She likes sugar and I like honey, too
We gonna rock it, I ain't gonna mess around with you
She digs rock 'n' roll
She likes rock 'n' roll
You want rock 'n' roll
I need rock 'n' roll everyday
And all through the night
She digs rock 'n' roll
She gives rock 'n' roll
She lives rock 'n' roll
I like rock 'n' roll
We gonna rock 'round, rockin' rollin' all in the town
We're gonna make it right
We're gonna make it rock all night
We're gonna rock 'round
Rockin' rollin' all in the town
We're gonna make it right,
We're gonna make it rock all night
