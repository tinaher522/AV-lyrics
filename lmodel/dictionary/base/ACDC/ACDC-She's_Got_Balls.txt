<song artist="AC/DC" title="She's_Got_Balls">
She's got style that woman
Makes me smile that woman
She's got spunk that woman
Funk that woman
She's got speed my babe
Got what I need my babe
She's got the ability
To make a man outta me
But most important of all
Let me tell you
My lady's got balls
She's got balls
She's got soul my lady
Likes to crawl my lady
All around the floor on her hands and knees
Oh because she likes to please me
But most important of all
Let me tell you
My lady's got balls
She's got balls
And she's got taste my lady
Pace my lady
Makes my heart race
With her pretty face
She's got balls my lady
Likes to crawl my lady
Hands and knees all around the floor
No one has to tell her what a fella is for
But most important of all
Let me tell you
My lady's got balls
She's got balls
