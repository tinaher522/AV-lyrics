<song artist="AC/DC" title="Ride_On">
It's another lonely evening
In another lonely town
But I ain't too young to worry
And I ain't too old to cry
When a woman gets me down
Got another empty bottle
And another empty bed
Ain't too young to admit it
No, I'm not too old to lie
I'm just another empty head
That's why I'm lonely
I'm so lonely
But I know what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna ride on
(Ride on)
(Ride on) Standing on the edge of the road
(Ride on) Thumb in the air
(Ride on) One of these days I'm gonna
(Ride on) Change my evil ways
Till then I'll just keep riding on
Broke another promise
Now I broke another heart
But I ain't too young to realize
That I ain't too old to try
Try to get back to the start
And it's another red light nightmare
Ooh, another red light street
And I ain't too old to hurry
'Cause I ain't too old to die
But I sure am hard to beat
But I'm lonely
Lord I'm lonely
What am I gonna do?
(Ride on)
(Ride on) Got myself a one-way ticket
(Ride on)
(Ride on) Going the wrong way
(Ride on) Gonna change my evil ways
(Ride on) One of these days
One of these days
Ride on
Ride on
I'm gonna ride on
Ride on, looking for a truck
Ride on
Ride on, keep on riding
Riding on and on and on and on
And on and on and on and on and on
(Ride on)
(Ride on) Gonna have myself a good time
(Ride on) Ooh yeah
(Ride on) Yeah, yeah, yeah
(Ride on) One of these days
(Ride on) One of these days
