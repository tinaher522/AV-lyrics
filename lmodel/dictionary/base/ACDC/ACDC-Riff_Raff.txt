<song artist="AC/DC" title="Riff_Raff">
You see it on television every day
You hear it on the radio
It ain't humid but it sure is hot
Way down in Mexico
Police tryin' to tell me
Beginnin' of the end
Sayin' it'll bend me
Too late my friend
Riff raff
Well it's good for a laugh (ha ha ha)
Riff raff
Go on and laugh yourself in half
(smile a while)
Now I'm the kind of guy that keeps his big mouth shut
But don't bother me
Somebody kickin' me when I'm up
Leave me in misery
I never shot nobody
Don't even carry a gun
I ain't done nothing wrong
I'm just havin' fun
Riff raff
Oh well it's good for a laugh
Riff raff
Go on laugh yourself in half
(thank you)
