<song artist="AC/DC" title="Stormy_May_Day">
The storm is raging
Winds are howling
The water's calling
Rescue you
A flash of lightning
Our times a'frightnin'
A wind is coming
And the sun don't shine
Rain day, May day
Rain day, stormy May day
Rain day, May day
Rain day, stormy May day
Stormy May Day
The sky is darkening
The dogs are barking
A call for help
You hope they get you through
A clap of thunder 
A split asunder
The people running 
And the moon doth rise
Rain day, May day
Rain day, stormy May day
Rain day, May day
Rain day, stormy May day
Rain day, stormy May day
