<song artist="AC/DC" title="Stand_Up">
Put on the headset, get on the stage
Out on a midnight escapade
Didn't want to steal your thunder
Wouldn't want to play your game
Makin' all the headlines
Gettin' on the front page
Didn't even know her number
Didn't even know her name
Stand up, stand up and take it
Stand up, stand up and make it
Stand up, stand up and face it
Stand up
Get on the red dress, slip on the lace
Up for a high heel and a pretty face
Woman wanna get you under
Woman wanna get you tame
Lovin' on a hot night
Stokin' up the flame
Didn't wanna know her number
Didn't wanna know her name
Stand up, stand up and take it
Stand up, stand up and make it
Stand up, stand up and face it
Stand up
(You can make it)
Stand up, stand up and take it
Stand up, stand up and make it
Stand up, stand up and face it
Stand up
