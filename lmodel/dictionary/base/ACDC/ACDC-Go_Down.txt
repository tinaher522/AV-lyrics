<song artist="AC/DC" title="Go_Down">
Ruby, Ruby, where you been so long?
Doin' drugs an' drinkin' whiskey
Baby since you been gone
Ain't no one I know do it good as you
Lickin' on that lickin' stick the way you do
You got the lips to make a strong man weak
And a heathen pray
Tell you ain't just the way you speak
You know it's just the way
You go down
Go down
Go down
Go down
Go down
Go down
Go down, go down, go down
Mary, Mary, you're the one for me
And the way you hum
Sting like a bumble bee
I'll be 'round to see you 'bout half past ten
Ain't felt this good
Since I don't know when
You got the touch that I need so much
In your finger tips
I got the honey that you love to taste
On those lovely lips
So go down
Go down
Go down
Go down, baby
Go down
Go down
Go down, go down, go down
Ooh, baby rub it on
You know it's sticky and sweet
And it's been so long
And no else got a touch like you
I let you do the things to me
I let no other woman do
Feels good, feels good, oh yeah
You do it like you should
Oh yeah yeah
I love you so much
Make me so glad I'm a man, go down
Go down
Go down
Go down
Go down
Go down
Go down, go down, go down
Go down
Go down
Go down
Go down, down, down
Go down
Go down
Go down, go down, go down
Go down
Go down
Go down, go down, go down
Go down
Go down
Go down, go down, go down
Go down
Go down
Go down, go down, go down
Go down
Go down
