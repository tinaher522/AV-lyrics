<song artist="AC/DC" title="Get_It_Hot">
Going out on the town
Just a me and you
Going to have ourselves-a party
Tonight I guess will do
Nobody's play 
Another note
Nobody's playing slow
And noone's playing hard tonight
To get on rock and roll
Get it hot 
Get it hot
Come on baby 
Get it hot
Get it hot 
Get it hot
Alright
Moving up and down everywhere
Got a whole lot of booze
Got myself a sweet little lady
Whose got nothing to lose
Nobody going to go straight
For nothing like the fife
So leave your body in the white place
Cause we can roll it by
Get it hot 
Get it hot
Come on baby 
Get it hot
Get it hot 
Get it hot
Alright
(Guitar Solo)
Get it hot 
Get it hot
Come on baby 
Get it hot
Get it hot 
Oh get hot
Oh you did it
Get it hot
Come on baby
Get it hot
Make me fell good
Get it hot
Come on baby
Get it hot 
Look out
