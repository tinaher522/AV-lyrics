<song artist="AC/DC" title="Have_A_Drink_On_Me">
Oh, whiskey, gin and brandy
With a glass I'm pretty handy
I'm trying to walk a straight line
On sour mash and cheap wine
Yeah, so join me for a drink boys
Oh, we're gonna make a big noise
So don't worry about tomorrow, take it today
Forget about the check, we'll get hell to pay
Have a drink on me
Have a drink on me
Yeah, have a drink on me
Have a drink on me
Come on
Oh, I'm dizzy, drunk and fighting
On tequila white lightning
Yes, my glass is getting shorter
On whiskey, ice and water
Yeah, so come on, have a good time
And get blinded out of your mind
So don't worry about tomorrow, take it today
Forget about the check, we'll get hell to pay
Have a drink on me
Have a drink on me
Yeah, have a drink on me
Have a drink on me
Get stoned
Have a drink on me
Oh, have a drink on me, yeah
Oh, have a drink on me
Come on
Oh, gonna roll around, gonna hit the ground
Take another swig, have another drink
Gonna drink it dry, gonna get me high
Come on all the boys, make a noise
Have a drink on me (have a drink on me)
Have a drink on me (have a drink on me)
Oh, have a drink on me (have a drink on me)
Have a drink on me
Have a drink on me
Have a drink on me
