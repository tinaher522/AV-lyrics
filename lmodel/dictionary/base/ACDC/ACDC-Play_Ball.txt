<song artist="AC/DC" title="Play_Ball">
Listen
Pick me up, fill my cup
Pour me another round
Come on in, mix in the sin
Come in and join the crowd
I said it's party time and I'm on the loose
Make it feel alright, listen
Drinks all around, I'm in the mood
Because the night is mine
Let's play ball
Shooting down the walls, yeah
Let's play ball, babe
Batting down the stalls
Play, play, play ball
Listen, said
Lock me up, I'm in lust
I'm on the leash and I'm bound
Dive on in and swim in the gin
Come on and shout it out loud
Let's play ball
Shooting down the walls, yeah
Let's play ball
Batting down the stalls, yeah
Play, play, play ball
Woo
Hit that thing right here
Hey yeah
Hit your home run
Let's play ball
Shooting down the walls, yeah
Let's play ball
Batting down the stalls, yeah
Let's play ball
Let's play ball
Let's play ball
Play, play, play ball
