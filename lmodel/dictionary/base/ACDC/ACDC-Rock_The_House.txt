<song artist="AC/DC" title="Rock_The_House">
Mistress, mistress, all night long, hey 
Oooh, keep on coming hard and strong
Hot to the touch, hot to the taste
Oozing out on my plate 
I'm gonna yell out
She's gonna shout
She's gonna push it
All the way down
Gonna kick up her heels
Make you scream
Rock on out, baby
Make you squeal
Rock the house 
Rock the house 
Rock this house 
Rock, rock, rock and let it roll 
Hold on tight, she please and tease 
Squeeze you right, she aim to please 
She's gonna kick her legs high in the air
She's gonna shake it down, a hot, wet, wild affair
Rock the house
Rock the house
Rock this house
Rock, rock, rock and let it roll
I look in my house and what do I see? 
A hot-blooded woman just a-waiting for me
Gonna kick up her heels, make you scream
Rock on out, baby, make you squeal
Rock the house
Rock the house
Rock this house
Rock, rock, rock and let it roll
Rock the house
Rock, rock, rock and let it roll
Let it roll
Rock the house down, yeah
Till the walls come down
