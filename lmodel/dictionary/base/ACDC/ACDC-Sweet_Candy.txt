<song artist="AC/DC" title="Sweet_Candy">
Here she come, yeah
Doing that thing, yeah
Make the boys go wild
Yeah, sweet child
She do a dance
Slides down a pole
She turn a backflip
Make your eyes roll
Caught in a spotlight
Crawls across the floor
Calls for attention
The boys yell out for more
Sweet Candy (Candy)
Sweet Candy (Candy)
Sweet Candy (Candy)
Sweet Candy (Candy)
Alright Candy 
She strips tonight 
Selling us her charms
She glide around the pole
Holding out her arms
She really rolls the dice
Panting in wait
She knows just what she done
And she give it all a shake
Sweet Candy (Candy)
Sweet Candy (Candy)
Sweet Candy (Candy)
Sweet Candy (Candy)
I said, alright Candy 
There she goes, yeah 
Yeah 
(Candy)
Sweet Candy (Candy)
Sweet Candy (Candy)
Sweet Candy (Candy)
I said, all night Candy 
Sweet, sweet Candy 
Sweet, sweet Candy 
Sweet, sweet Candy 
All night Candy
