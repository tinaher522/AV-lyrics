<song artist="AC/DC" title="Highway_To_Hell">
Livin' easy
Lovin' free
Season ticket on a one way ride
Askin' nothin'
Leave me be
Takin' everythin' in my stride
Don't need reason
Don't need rhyme
Ain't nothin' I'd rather do
Goin' down
Party time
My friends are gonna be there, too
Ehh
I'm on the highway to Hell
On the highway to Hell
Highway to Hell
I'm on the highway to Hell
No stop signs
Speed limit
Nobody's gonna slow me down
Like a wheel
Gonna spin it
Nobody's gonna mess me around
Hey Satan
Payin' my dues
Playin' in a rocking band
Hey momma
Look at me
I'm on my way to the Promised Land
Wow
I'm on the highway to Hell
Highway to Hell
I'm on the highway to Hell
Highway to Hell
Mmm, don't stop me
Ehh, ehh, oww
I'm on the highway to Hell
On the highway to Hell
I'm on the highway to Hell
On the highway to
Hell
Highway to Hell (I'm on the highway to Hell)
Highway to Hell (Highway to Hell)
Highway to Hell (Momma, I'm on the)
Highway to Hell
And I'm goin' down, all the way, wowwww
I'm on the highway to Hell
