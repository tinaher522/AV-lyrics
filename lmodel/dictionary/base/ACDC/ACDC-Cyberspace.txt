<song artist="AC/DC" title="Cyberspace">
High tail in your face 
Black hole rockin' the place 
Hong Kong videos 
Big bang mad to blow, yeah
Into cyberspace
Into cyberspace
Into cyberspace
Look out, I'm gonna rage 
Eight ball in the pack 
Big bone juke box jack
Hot star burnin' it up 
Full moon runnin' amok, yeah
Into cyberspace
Into cyberspace
Into cyberspace
Look out, I'm gonna rage 
Blow you into cyberspace
Blow you all into cyberspace
Blow you into cyberspace
Blow you all into cyberspace
Gotta get out, get out of this place 
Blow a big hole into cyberspace
Gotta get out, get out of this place 
Blow a big hole into cyberspace, yeah
Cyberspace
Well, octane down the track
Flat chat smash the mach
Blow out burnin' hot
Mile high take you right to the top
Into cyberspace
Into cyberspace
Into cyberspace
Look out, you gotta let me out 
Into cyberspace
Into cyberspace
Into cyberspace
Look out, you gotta race
Blow you into cyberspace
Blow you all into cyberspace
Blow you into cyberspace
Blow you all into cyberspace
Blow you into cyberspace
Blow you all into cyberspace
Blow you into cyberspace
Blow you all into cyberspace
Blow you
Blow you
Blow you into cyberspace
