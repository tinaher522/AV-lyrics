<song artist="AC/DC" title="This_Means_War">
(You get your head down, will you)
I want you
I want you to
I want you to march
Eyes go right, shoulder arms
Left wheel turn, show your charms
Change your clothes, cut your hair
Ain't no joke, ain't no place for kids
When the flags are high, hear the battle cry
Treaty gone, see the bandits fly
Dig the trench, watch that blast
Shell shock come, coming fast
Name and rank on parade
Might get laid by a hand grenade
Do you know what it means?
This - means - war
This means war, this means war
I said this means war, this means war
This means war
(Run for cover, hit the deck, call for your mother)
I need you to fire
Cock your gun, wet your sights
Get the bull dead to rights
Volunteers, one pace back
On the beach ain't no place for kids
When the flack is high on a bomber run
You don't talk back to an ack-ack gun
Fire range, and you're in the blitz
Keep your head or you're blown to bits
Name and rank on parade
Might get laid by a hand grenade
Do you know what it means?
This - means - war
Who's going there, is it a friend or foe?
Propaganda time on the radio
Top brass shout as they clown around
Peace talks die in Geneva town
Do you know what it means?
This - means - war
This means war, this means war
I said this means war, this means war
This means war
