<song artist="AC/DC" title="You_Shook_Me_All_Night_Long">
She was a fast machine
She kept her motor clean
She was the best damn woman
That I ever seen
She had the sightless eyes
Telling me no lies
And knocking me out
With those American thighs
Taking more than her share
Had me fighting for air
She told me to come
But I was already there
'Cause the walls started shaking
The earth was quaking
My mind was aching
And we were making it
And you
Shook me all night long
Yeah, you
Shook me all night long
Working double time 
On the seduction line
She was one of a kind
She's just mine all mine
Wanted no applause
Just another course
Made a meal out of me
And come back for more
Had to cool me down
To take another round
Now I'm back in the ring
To take another swing
But the walls were shaking
The earth was quaking
My mind was aching
And we were making it 
And you
Shook me all night long
Yeah, you
Shook me all night long
And knocked me out, I said, you
Shook me all night long
You had me shaking and you
Shook me all night long
Yeah, you shook me
When you took me
You really took me and you
Shook me all night long
Oh-oh-oh you
Shook me all night long
Yeah yeah, you
Shook me all night long
You really got me and you
Shook me all night long
Yeah, you shook me
Yeah, you shook me
All night long
