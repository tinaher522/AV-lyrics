<song artist="AC/DC" title="Crabsody_In_Blue">
Well they moved on down
And they crawled around
Walkin' sideways, sideway walkin'
Give me the blues
And you start to scratch
When they start to hatch
Walkin' sideways, sideway walkin'
Give me the blues
Oh, but when they start to bite
Then it's time you saw the light
For an appointment, I know
Before you start to scream
That's when you apply the cream
Blues ointment
Oh well the doctor said
"We got to make 'em dead"
Walkin' sideways, sideway walkin'
Give me the blues
And when you start to scream
That's when you apply the cream
Blues ointment
Yeah, and when they start to itch
You go out and take the bitch
For an appointment
Well you rub it on
And you rub it in
Stops 'em walking, sideway walkin'
Gives them the blues
Sideway walkin', sideway walkin'
They got the blues
Give them the blues
They got the blues
Give them the blues
