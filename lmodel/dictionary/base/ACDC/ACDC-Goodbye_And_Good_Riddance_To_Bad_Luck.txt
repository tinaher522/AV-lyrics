<song artist="AC/DC" title="Goodbye_And_Good_Riddance_To_Bad_Luck">
Getting bombed out on booze
Got nothing to lose
Run out of money
Disposable blues
Sleazy hotels
Like living in hell
The girls on the hustle
With nothing to sell
Want something for nothing
It's always the same
Keep pushing and shoving
And I'm down on the game
Always in trouble
Forever detained
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
And good riddance to bad luck
Well spread out the news
There's a free man loose
Back out of jail
And chasing some flooze
Bad luck has changed
Broken the chains
Lay down a claim
For monetary gains
Wonder what's coming
Out for the take
Freedom for loving
And lust for the taste
Eyes are wide open
Wild to the game
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
And good riddance to bad luck
Goodbye and good riddance to bad luck
(Woo yeah
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
and good riddance to bad luck
oooh yeah
to bad luck
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Bad luck
Goodbye, good riddance to bad luck
said goodbye, good riddance to bad luck
Broken the chains
of bad luck
Bye, bye, bye
Bad luck
Throw down the gates
of bad luck
goodbye and good riddance
to bad luck)
