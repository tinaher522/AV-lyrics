<song artist="AC/DC" title="Put_The_Finger_On_You">
I put the finger on you
My hands all out of control
I can't stop it getting down on you
It's moving on it's own accord
Yes, I've got fire in my fingertips
Radiating onto you
I can't control it, can't even hold it
It's knocking on your door
And you know what it's for
I put the finger right on you
I put the finger right on you
You put your finger on me too
Then I put the finger, I put the finger
Yeah I put the finger, I put the finger
I put the finger on you for sure
It's the key to unlocking your door, don't you know
I've broken through your security
My hands ain't tied no more,
You better watch out
I can't control it, can't even hold it
Sneaking up on your front door
You can feel it on your ankle
Feel it on your knee
Feel it on your thigh
Can you feel me?
I put the finger right on you
I put the finger right on you
You put your finger on me too
Then I put the finger, I put the finger
Yeah I put the finger, I put the finger
I can't control it, can't even hold it
Sneaking up on your front door
You can feel it on your ankle
Feel it on your knee
Feel it on your thigh
Can you feel me?
Put it - right on you
I'll do it if you want me to
Can I put it?
I put the finger on you
