<song artist="AC/DC" title="Rock_'N'_Roll_Train">
One hot angel
One cool devil
Your mind on a fantasy
Livin' on the ecstasy
Give it all, give it
Give it what you got
Come on, give it all a lot
Pick it up, move it
Give it to the spot
Your mind on fantasy
Livin' on ecstasy
Runaway train (Runnin' right off the track)
Runaway train (Runnin' right off the track)
Runaway train (Runnin' right off the track)
Now, the runaway train (Runnin' right off the track)
One hard ringin' bell
Old-school rebel
A ten for the revelry
Jammin' up the agency
Shake it, shake it
Take it to the spot
You know she make it really hot
Get it on, get it up
Come on, give it all you got
Your mind on fantasy
Livin' on the ecstasy
Runaway train (Runnin' right off the track)
Yeah, the runaway train, yeah (Runnin' right off the track)
On the runaway train (Runnin' right off the track)
Runaway train (Runnin' right off the track)
One hot Southern belle
Son of a devil
A schoolboy spellin' bee
A schoolgirl with a fantasy
One hard ringin' bell
Old-school rebel
A ten for the revelry
Jammin' up the agency
Shake it, shake it
Take it to the spot
You know, she make it really hot, yeah
Get it on, get it up
Come on, give it what you got
You know she's just like a
Runaway train (Runnin' right off the track)
She's comin' off the track
Runaway train, yeah (Runnin' right off the track)
Get it on, get it up
Come on, give it all you got
Runaway train (Runnin' right off the track)
Runaway train (Runnin' right off the track)
