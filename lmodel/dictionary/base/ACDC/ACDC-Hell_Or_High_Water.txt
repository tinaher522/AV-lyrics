<song artist="AC/DC" title="Hell_Or_High_Water">
(Watch out, out of my way, you wanna stay)
Everybody
You don't have to choose it
You don't have to prove it
It's only rock 'n' roll
Mama done told me
Papa done scold me
Superstition
Black cat in a cradle
Dancin' on the table
Don't you snake on me
Mama done told me
Daddy done scold me
Told me, showed me
You know what he showed me
Come hell or high water
Come hell or high water
Come hell or high water
Come hell or high water
Hot money
Lyin' through your back teeth
Fightin' on the main street
Breathe your last breath on me
Mama done told me
Poor boy get home
Hot lovin'
Turn your happy feeling
Touchin' and a teasin'
You know it so bad
Mama done told me
Papa done scold me
Told me, showed me
Rock 'n' rolled me
Come hell or high water
Come hell or high water
Come hell or high water
Come hell or high water
Come hell, hell hell hell hell
Come hell or high water
Come hell or high water
Come hell or high water
Come hell or high water
Na na na na na na
Come hell or high water
Come hell or high water
Come hell or high water
Come hell or high water
Come hell or high water
Come hell or high water
Come hell or high water
I tell ya come hell, come hell, come hell
Come on hell yeah
