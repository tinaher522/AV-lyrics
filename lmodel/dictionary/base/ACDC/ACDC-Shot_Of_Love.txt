<song artist="AC/DC" title="Shot_Of_Love">
Come on honey, take a trip with me 
We'll take a double shot of ecstasy 
I'll drink some water from a wooden cup 
Keep a rocking till the sun comes up 
And I warn you, it's the best shot of your life 
Shot of love 
Rock you little lady make you blow and breath 
A little bit of what you need is guaranteed 
Come on now honey we'll get full of desire 
A humping and pumping till we start a fire 
And I warn you, it's the best shot of your life 
Shot of love 
Shot of love 
I'm gonna make you plead 
And I warn you, it's the best shot of your life 
Shot of love 
Like to plead 
Shot of love 
A humping and pumping got you jumping 
Shot of love 
A little bit of what you need is guaranteed 
Shot of love 
Let me warn you 
I'm coming for you 
Shot of love 
Come on give me shot of love
