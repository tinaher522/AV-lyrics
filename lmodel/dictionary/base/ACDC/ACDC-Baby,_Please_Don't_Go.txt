<song artist="AC/DC" title="Baby,_Please_Don't_Go">
Baby, please don't go
Baby, please don't go
Baby, please don't go down to New Orleans
You know I love you so
Baby, please don't go
When the man done gone
When the man done gone
When the man done gone down to the county farm
He got the shackles on
Baby, please don't go
Don't leave me!
I'll be a dog
I'll be a dog, whew
I'll be a dog, kiss you way down there
When you walk along
Baby, please don't go
Baby, please don't go
Baby, please don't go
Baby, please don't go down to New Orleans
You know I love you so
Baby, please don't go, yeah
No, baby, please don't leave me
Why must you go away and do this to me, baby?
I wanna suffer for you, suffer, suffer
Oh, baby, please don't go
No!
Baby, baby, baby, please don't go
Please don't go
Don't go and leave me
Please don't go
Baby, hmm
Baby, ahah
Oh don't go, ooh don't go
Oh don't go, ooh don't go
Ah don't go, don't go so slow
Oh don't go, ooh don't go
Why must you leave me lying on my back?
Going across the other side of the track
Found yourself a new man, I know
So baby, please don't go
Baby, please don't go
No! No! No! No! 
Oh please, please don't leave me!
I don't want to be left alone, baby!
Ah don't go, don't go, don't go!
No!
