<song artist="AC/DC" title="Love_Hungry_Man">
You're the one I've waited for
I need your love more and more
I don't know what your name is
I don't know what your game is
I want to take you tonight
Animal appetite
'Cause I'm a love hungry man
Yeah I'm a love hungry man
Don't want no conversation
I need sweet sensation
And all I want to do
Is make a meal out of you
'Cause I'm a love, love hungry, hungry man
I got to get my hands on you 
'Cause I'm a love, love, love hungry man
I'm telling you, that I am
Whoa I'm your love hungry, hungry man
Oh baby you're such a treat
Love, and love, hungry man
And a man's got to eat
I'm a love, You're the one I've waited for
Oh yes you are
I'm a love, I need your loving more and more
You're a duo
'Cause I'm a love, love, love, love hungry man
Oh yes I am
I'm a love, love, love, love hungry man
Just a little bit
And I'm a love, love, love, love hungry man
Oh
Oh I'm a love, love, love, love hungry man
Don't you know
I'm a love, love, love, love hungry man
Ohhhh
I'm a love, love, love, love hungry man
Yes I am
??? man
Yes I am
You know it's good to eat
Bon Appetite
I'm your love hungry man
