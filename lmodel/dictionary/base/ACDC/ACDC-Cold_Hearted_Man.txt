<song artist="AC/DC" title="Cold_Hearted_Man">
No one knew where he came from
He never knew himself
Call her Ma, call him Pa
But he was born to someone else
No one fooled or messed him 'round
'Cause they were all afraid
Ain't no lies, ice in the eyes
Of Leroy Kincaid
Cold hearted man
One time lover heart in his hand
Cold hearted man
And you can't trust nothing you don't understand
Cold hearted man
Cold hearted man
Like a snake, he had no friends
He didn't need no one
Hurt his pride deep inside
He was another mother's son
Reputation, broken glass
Everybody prayed 
For their lives on the street
Where they happened to meet Leroy Kincaid
Cold hearted man
One time lover heart in his hand
Cold hearted man
And you can't trust nothing you don't understand
Cold hearted man
Cold hearted man
Sometimes you can't see
The other side
It's too well hidden
For the naked eye
One time lover
With his heart in his hand
Two time loser
A broken man
Cold hearted man
He was a cold hearted man
Cold hearted man
Cold hearted man
Cold hearted man
Was a cold hearted man
Cold hearted man
Cold hearted man
