<song artist="AC/DC" title="Shake_A_Leg">
Idle juvenile on the street, on the street
Ooh he's kicking everything with his feet, with his feet
Fightin' on the wrong side of the law, of the law
Don't kick, don't fight, don't sleep at night
And shake a leg
Shake a leg
Shake a leg
Shake it down
Keeping out of trouble
With eyes in the back of my face
Kicking ass in the class
And they tell me you're a damn disgrace
They tell me what they think, but they stink
And I really don't care
Got a mind of my own
Move on get out of my hair
Shake a leg
Shake you hand
Shake a leg
Wake the dead
Shake a leg
Get stuck in
Shake a leg
Shake a leg
Magazines, wet dreams
Dirty women on machines for me
Big licks, skin flicks, tricky dicks
Are my chemistry
Cut against the grain
Try to keep up the same with you
So stop your grinnin'
And drop your linen for me
Shake a leg
Shake you hand
Shake a leg
Wake the dead
Shake a leg
Get stuck in
Shake a leg
Shake a leg
Shake it
Come on, yeah
Idle juvenile on the street, on the street
Kicking everything with his feet, with his feet
Fightin' on the wrong side of the law, of the law
Spitin' and bitin' and kickin' and fightin' for more
Oh shake a leg
Shake you hand
Shake a leg
Wake the dead
Shake a leg
Get stuck in
Shake a leg
Play to win
Shake a leg
Shake you hand
Shake a leg
Wake the dead
Shake a leg
Get stuck in
Shake a leg
Shake a leg
Shake it
