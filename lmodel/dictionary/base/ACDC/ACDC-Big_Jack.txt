<song artist="AC/DC" title="Big_Jack">
The steam is a-burning
Workin' up and down the line
The party's getting ready
He's been working it so hard
When it comes to lovin'
Big Jack is on his way
Wink of satisfaction
His time is going on
I'm like a bad defender
Smoking holy Joe
He's a big pretender
Look out for jack, he's on his way
Big Jack, Big Jack
You know it's only natural, he gets you up to scratch
Big Jack, Big Jack
You've got a reputation, you really got the knack
Big Jack, Big Jack
He said that he's the only one who got a full sack
Big Jack, look out Jack
He's always got your back
He never leave a dollar
Racking up the balls
He like to get it on fast
Back there standing tall
When he hears the siren
He's gonna put you on the racks
He's got a bad reputation
Climbing all over the bars
Gonna press the flesh
Rockin' rollin' soldier
He's the last of them all
Well tell Jack, he's on his way
Big Jack, Big Jack
You know it's only natural to get you up to scratch
Big Jack, Big Jack
Always into trouble, got to turn the other way
Big Jack, Big Jack
Always likes to party and he likes the girls to play
Big Jack, look out Jack
He's always got your back
Big Jack, Big Jack
You know it's only natural to get you up to scratch
Big Jack, Big Jack
You've got a reputation, really got the knack
Big Jack, Big Jack
I said he ain't the only one who got a full sack
Big Jack, look out Jack
Ain't no need to worry, he's always got your back
