<song artist="AC/DC" title="Whole_Lotta_Rosie">
Wanna tell you a story
'Bout a woman I know
When it comes to lovin'
Oh, she steals the show
She ain't exactly pretty
She ain't exactly small
42-39-56
You could say she's got it all
Never had a woman,  never had a woman like you
Doin' all the things, doin' all the things you do
Ain't no fairy story
Ain't no skin-and-bones
But you give all you got, weighin' in at nineteen stone
You're a whole lotta woman
A whole lotta woman
A whole lotta Rosie
A whole lotta Rosie
A whole lotta Rosie
And you're a whole lotta woman
Honey, you can do, do it to me all night long
Only one can turn, only one can turn me on
All through the nighttime
Right around the clock
To my suprise, Rosie never stops
She was a whole lotta woman
A whole lotta woman
Whole lotta Rosie
Whole lotta Rosie
Whole lotta Rosie
A whole lotta woman, yeah-yeah-yeah
You're a whole lotta woman
A whole lotta woman
Whole lotta Rosie
Whole lotta Rosie
You're a whole lotta Rosie
Whole lotta woman, yeah-yeah-yeah
Whole lotta Rosie
Whole lotta woman
Whole lotta woman
