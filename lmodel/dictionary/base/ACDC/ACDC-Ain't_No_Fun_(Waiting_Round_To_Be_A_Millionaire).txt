<song artist="AC/DC" title="Ain't_No_Fun_(Waiting_Round_To_Be_A_Millionaire)">
The following is a true story
Only the names have been changed
To protect the guilty -
Well I left my job in my home town
And I headed for the smoke
Got a rock 'n' roll band and a fast right hand
Gonna get to the top
Nothing's gonna stop us, no nothing
So if you've got the money, we've got the sound
You put it up and we'll put it down
If you got the dollar, we got the song
Just wanna boogie woogie all night long
Yeh boogie
I got holes in my shoes
I got holes in my teeth
I got holes in my socks
I can't get no sleep
I'm trying to make a million
And I got patches on the patches
On my old blue jeans
Well they used to be blue
When they used to be new
When they used to be clean
But I've got a Momma whose a hummer (and I've gota mama, whose a hummer)
Whose keeping me alive ((just) keepin' me alive)
While I'm in the band doing drinking with the boys (while I'mdoin' drinkin
She's working 9 to 5 (with the boys)
(She) knows her place that woman
Just you wait -
One of these days see me driving round town
In my rock 'n' Rolls Royce with the sun roof down
My bottle of booze
No summer time blues
Shouting out, "Look at me"
In my rock 'n' roll voice
Ain't no fun waiting round to be a millionaire
Repeat
"Hey hello Howard, how you doin', my next door neighbour?"
"Oh yea... Get your fuckin' jumbo jet off my airport"
