<song artist="AC/DC" title="Borrowed_Time">
Got the word, getting ready
Gonna get my pay from movin' 
I'm in light, I'm ready
When the action is hot, ? ? ? ? 
No town, no city
Gonna be free from the jumping jack
Kiss of life, getting gritty
If the mule don't kick you know the mule don't ride
And I know, yes I know, well I know
That's the way to go
And I know, and I know, ooh
And I know that I'm gonna get it down the road
'Cause I'm living on a borrowed time
Do it your way, I'll do it mine
Living on a borrowed time
Don't need a shove, don't need a sign, no sign
Call me names, call me crazy
Don't try to stop me when I feel this way
It's a game, whoopsy daisy
Here come another girl to make my day
And I know, yes I know, well I know
That's the way to go
And I know, yes I know
I'm gonna get up when I'm up on the road
'Cause I'm living on a borrowed time
Do your way your way, I'll do it mine
Living on a borrowed time
Don't need a shove, don't need a sign
So long, goodbye
Good luck, au revoir baby
(look out people, nothin' left to loose)
'Cause I'm living on a borrowed time
You do it your way, I'll do it mine
Living on a borrowed time
Don't need a shove, don't need a sign
Living on a borrowed time
Living on a borrowed time
And I'm living on a borrowed time
Don't need a shove, don't need a sign, no sign
I don't need a sign to show me the way
