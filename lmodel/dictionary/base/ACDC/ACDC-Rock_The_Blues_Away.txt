<song artist="AC/DC" title="Rock_The_Blues_Away">
Driving in my car 
We're heading for the local bar 
Picking up my girl tonight 
'Everything will gonna be alright' 
Shooting pool with my friends 
Smoking cigarettes 
Telling jokes out loud
And laughing with the crowd
And we're rocking (and we're rocking)
And we're rolling (and we're rolling)
And we're laughing (and we're laughing)
And we're joking (and we're joking)
And we're rolling 
Baby, we're rocking and rolling 
We won't get the blues, because we 
Rock the blues and play 
Up all night and day
Drink the night away
Till the light of day
When I'm on my way back home
I listen to the radio
I hear some great rock sounds
To make you want to sing out loud
And we're rocking (and we're rocking)
And we're rolling (and we're rolling)
And we're laughing (and we're laughing)
And we're joking (and we're joking)
And we're rolling
Baby, we're rocking and rolling 
We won't get the blues, because we 
Rock the blues and play
Up all night and day
Drink the night away
Till the light of day
Rock the blues and play
Up all night and day
Drink the night away
Until the light of day
(Rock the blues and play)
Up all night and day
(Drink the night away)
Till the light of day
