<song artist="AC/DC" title="Meltdown">
Now, I look at my watch to find out 
The right time of day
I look at her libido
Hey, hey, hey
Gotta get up and climb her 
To roll her on the hay
Making a sweat, temperature rise 
All through the day
Man it's getting hot, hot, hot
I said man it's getting hot, hot, hot
It's getting hotter
And hotter
Man it's getting hot, hot
It's getting hot around here
It's a meltdown
It's a meltdown
I got a feeling in my bones
I been racking my brains out
All night long
Stoking up the fire 
Take it right up to the wire
Burning on and on
Burning on
Man it's getting hot, hot, hot
I said man it's getting hot, hot, hot
It's getting hotter
And hotter
Man it's getting hot, hot
It's getting hot around here
It's a meltdown
It's a meltdown
It's a meltdown
It's a meltdown

Man it's getting hot, hot, hot
I said man it's getting hot, hot, hot
It's getting hotter
And hotter 
And hotter 
And hotter 
It's a meltdown
It's a meltdown
It's a meltdown
It's a meltdown
It's a meltdown, gonna burn
It's a meltdown, I said burn, burn 
It's a meltdown, meltdown, meltdown
It's a meltdown
It's a meltdown
