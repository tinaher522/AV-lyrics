<song artist="AC/DC" title="Let's_Make_It">
Hey sugar baby
So hot and tasty
Come on give me some love
You're driving me wild
It's way past midnight
Why don't we take a ride
We'll make some honey
As we cruise real slow
Lets make it, don't waste it
Lets make it, come on and taste it
Lets make it, don't waste it
Lets make it, come on and taste it
I'll be your ladies man
If you give me the chance
We keep a jumpin'
Till the music run dry
And if we take a rest
We'll smoke some cigarettes
And start a smoking
Going out of control
Lets make it, don't waste it
Lets make it, come on and taste it
Lets make it, don't waste it

Lets make it, come on and taste it
Nah Nah Nah, Nah Nah Nah 
Let's not waste it
Nah Nah Nah, Nah Nah Nah
Nah Nah Nah, Nah Nah Nah 
We're gonna make it
Lets make it, don't waste it
Lets make it, come on and taste it
Lets make it, don't waste it
Lets make it, come on and taste it
Nah Nah Nah, Nah Nah Nah 
Let's not waste it
Nah Nah Nah, Nah Nah Nah
Nah Nah Nah, Nah Nah Nah 
We're gonna make it
Let's go
Lets make it, don't waste it
Lets make it, come on and taste it
Lets make it, don't waste it
Lets make it, come on and taste it
