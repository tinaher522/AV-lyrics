<song artist="AC/DC" title="Rock_'N'_Roll_Dream">
Deep water all around me
And circle sharks all about
Deep in trouble, had me turned around
Man up and one man down
You pretty women gather 'round
You can't pick up not a single sound
You feel you're winning, that's what it's all about
Knowing when you're winning, oooh
And it could be the very last time
I could be in a rock 'n' roll dream
I could be in a rock 'n' roll dream
Circle sharks all about you
You come up and you don't know why
Where goes a woman with a warm embrace?
Does a man walk in the hard rain?
I'm amazed at the mess you found
Coming up and I'm standing next in line
Give into none and that one comes
Hear me hollerin' I get the most
I could be in a rock 'n' roll dream
I could be in a rock 'n' roll dream
I could be in a rock 'n' roll dream
I could be in a rock 'n' roll dream
Circle sharks down and 'round
Deep water all around, 'round, 'round
Deep water all around, 'round and 'round
Round 'round, 'round
Round 'round and 'round, deep water
Round 'round and 'round, deep water
I could be in a rock 'n' roll dream
I could be in a rock 'n' roll dream
I could be in a rock 'n' roll dream
I could be in a rock 'n' roll dream
