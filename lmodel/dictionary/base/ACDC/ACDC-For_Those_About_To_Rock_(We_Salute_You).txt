<song artist="AC/DC" title="For_Those_About_To_Rock_(We_Salute_You)">
Oh yeah, yeah
Whoa, oh oh
We roll tonight
To the guitar bite
Yeah yeah
Oh
Stand up and be counted
For what you are about to receive
We are the dealers
We'll give you everything you need
Hail, hail to the good times
'Cause rock has got the right of way
We ain't no legend, ain't no cause
We're just livin' for today
For those about to rock, we salute you
For those about to rock, we salute you
We rock at dawn on the front line
Like a bolt right out of the blue
The sky's alight with a guitar bite
Heads will roll and rock tonight
For those about to rock, we salute you
For those about to rock, we salute you
For those about to rock, we salute you, yes we do
For those about to rock, we salute you
Oh, salute
We're just a battery for hire with a guitar fire
Ready and aimed at you
Pick up your balls and load up your cannon
For a twenty-one gun salute
For those about to rock - fire! - we salute you
Oh, for those about to rock, we salute you
Those about to rock - fire! - we salute you
Fire - we salute you
We salute you, come on
For those about to rock, we salute you
For those about to rock, we salute you
For those about to rock, we salute you
For those about to rock, we salute you
Shoot! Shoot!
Shoot! Shoot!
For those who give, for those who take
Those left high and those on the make
We salute you, yeah
We salute you
We salute you
We salute you
Fire!
