<song artist="AC/DC" title="Decibel">
Take up all your time
Kick up your heels, lookin' fine
And you come riding blind
You come rollin' back a while
Wind blowin' on ya
We're gonna move on and on, yeah
Sweating heat, soak you all
Being out will make you crawl all night
Decibel
Oh, decibel
Has you from deep inside
You were waving, then you smiled
Give me rock and roll
They're in love,
Love in the rain
They're in there, rocking standing proud
Decibel
That's the history of rock and roll
Decibel
Rain is coming on
We're gonna ride along
A hundred miles in all
Getting in night till dawn
Spread the joy coming on
Yeah, hard and long
Ooh, staring down
With a shock, hit the ground
Decibel
Oh, decibel
Ooh, decibel
You come rolling back a while
Decibel
Ooh yeah, decibel
