<song artist="AC/DC" title="What_Do_You_Do_For_Money_Honey">
You're working in bars, riding in cars
Never gonna give it for free
Your apartment with a view on the finest avenue
Looking at your beat on the street
You're always pushing, shoving, satisfied with nothing
You bitch, you must be getting old
So stop your love on the road, all your digging for gold
You make me wonder, yes I wonder, I wonder
Honey, what do you do for money?
Honey, what do you do for money?
Oh, where do you get your kicks?
You're riding on the take and you're always on the make
Squeezing all the blood out of men
They're standing in a queue just to spend the night wth you
It's business as usual again
You're always grabbing, stabbing, trying to get it back
But girl you must be getting slow
So stop your love on the road, all your digging for gold
You make me wonder, yes I wonder, yes I wonder
Honey, what do you do for money?
Oh, honey, what do you do for money?
Yeah, what do you do for money honey?
How do you get your kicks?
What do you do for money honey?
How do you get your licks? Go
Oh, honey, what do you do for money?
I said, honey, what do you do for money?
(Oh-ho yeah) Honey, (oh yeah honey) what do you do for money (what you gonna do?)
(Oh now) Honey, (oh yeah honey) what do you do for money?
What you gonna do?
Aw, what you gonna do?
