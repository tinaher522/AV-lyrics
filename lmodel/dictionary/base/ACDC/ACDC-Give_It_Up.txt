<song artist="AC/DC" title="Give_It_Up">
Oooh yeah
Well there will be no words of fighting 
Around here
'Cause nothin' don't matter
'Cause it ain't clear
Well it could be on a Monday
Or it could even be a Sunday
So if you can't stand the distance
You better disappear
Do I make myself clear?
I'm ready to rock 
I'm gonna rip it
Ready to rock 
Yeah I'm gonna stick it
Give it up, give it out
Whip it up, all about
Stick it up, shout it loud
Come on
Give it up
Give it up
Give it up
Give it up
Oooh yeah
Well it's a big storm a-howling 
Around here
And there be no one to sinning 
And no beer
I'm gonna aim to fire a rocket
There ain't no damn way to stop it
I got a sure-fire bullet to get you out of here
I said, do I make myself clear?
I'm ready to rock 
Yeah I'm gonna whip it
Ready to rock
Yeah, I'm gonna stick it
Give it up, give it out
I said whip it up, all about
You gotta stick it up, shout it loud
Come on
Give it up
Give it up
Give it up
Give it up
I'm going crazy on a wild man's night
Take your pick of anything you like
Give it up
Give it up
Sitting pretty, all ready to bite
She give it up, a bit of cream delight
Give it up
Give it up
Give it up
Give it up
Give it up, give it out
Whip it up, all about
You gotta stick it up, shout it loud
Give it up, all around
(Give it up) Give it up, give it up, give it out
(Give it up) Whipin' it in, whipin' it out
(Give it up) Stick it up, stick it up, stick it out
(Give it up) Give it up, all around
Give it up
Give it up
Give it up
Give it up
Giving it up
Sticking it out
Giving it up
Giving it up
Give it up
Yeah baby
Do I make myself clear?
