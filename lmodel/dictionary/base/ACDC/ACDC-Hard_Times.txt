<song artist="AC/DC" title="Hard_Times">
Two, three, four
Feeling low
Going down slow
Make it quake
And make a body shake
Tryin' to hold you down
They can't push you around
They try to hold you back
Getting on the right track
Hard times, blue and sad
Don't you cross the line
Long run, make it fun
Freeing up the time
Heart a-pumping
Feet a-jumping
This hard lovin'
Keeps me runnin'
They try to hold you down
They can't push you around
Trying to hold you back
Getting on the right track
Hard times, blue and sad
Don't you cross the line
Long run, make it fun
Freeing up the time
Hard times, dead on time
Follow me down the line
Hard times, get online
Make a grown man blind
Hard times, these hard times
Sure ain't been good to me
Hard times, hard times
Sure been misery
Hard times, blue and sad
Don't you cross the line
Long run, make it fun
Freeing up the time
Hard times, dead on time
Follow me down the line
Hard times, get online
Make a grown man blind
