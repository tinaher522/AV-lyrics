<song artist="AC/DC" title="Down_Payment_Blues">
I know that it's evil
I know that it's got to be
I know I ain't doing much
Doing nothing means a lot to me
Living on a shoe string
A fifty cent millionaire
Open to charity
Rock 'n' roller welfare
Sitting in my Cadillac
Listening to my radio
Suzy baby get on in
Tell me where she want to go
I'm living in a nightmare
She's looking like a wet dream
I got myself a Cadillac
But I can't afford the gasoline
CHORUS:
I've got holes in my shoes
And I'm way overdue
Down payment blues
Get myself a steady job
Some responsibility
Can't even feed my cat
On social security
Hiding from the rent man
Oh it makes me want to cry
Sheriff knocking on my door
Ain't it funny how the time flies
Sitting on my sailing boat
Sipping off my champaign
Suzy baby all at sea (Suzy baby you're obscene)
Say she want to come again
Feeling like a paper cup
(Floating | Blowing) down a storm drain
Got myself a sailing boat
But I can't afford the gasoline (...afford a drop of rain)
CHORUS
