<song artist="AC/DC" title="Smash_'N'_Grab">
Come on and blow your mind
You're out of time
Ooh, beat your chest
Join in like all the rest
Ooh, shove 'em back
Hey, hey, hey, yes
Hey, hey, hey, yeah
Seems like you run a mile
Hey try to unwind
Come on, let's blow your mind
It's no use, you ain't got time
Without a sound
Come on let's get around
Oh I hear the crash
Come on in and just
Smash, grab and take it
(Ah) While you can
Smash, grab and take it
(Ah) Hey, hey, hey, yeah
Why don't you come out?
Come on, run it to the ground
You're gonna blow your mind
You're gonna pulverize
Once you've come up late
You gotta pick up straight
It's gonna blow your mind
And all the living's gone
Smash, grab and take it
(Ah) Take it for yourself
Smash, grab and take it
(Ah) Take it, take it, take it, yeah
Ooh, steal the money
I'm taking while I can
Come on, let's blow your mind
Hey, hey, hey, yeah
Shoot 'em right down
Ooh take it while you can
Come on, let's blow your mind
Smash, grab, take it
(Ah) Hey, hey, hey, yeah
Smash, grab and take it for yourself
(Ah) Smash, grab and take it
