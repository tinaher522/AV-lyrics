<song artist="AC/DC" title="Shot_Down_In_Flames">
Out on the town, looking for a woman
Gonna give me good love
Anybody want to hang out with me
I'm really burning up
She was standing alone over by the jukebox
Like she's something to sell
I said, Baby what's the going price
She told me to go to hell
Shot down in flames
Shot down in flames
Ain't it a shame
To be shot down in flames
Singles bar, eye on a honey
Hanging out everywhere
She might be straight
She might want my money
I really don't care, no
Said, Baby, you're driving me crazy
Layed it out on the line
When a guy with a chip on his shoulder said
Toss off buddy she's mine, oh
Shot down in flames
Shot down in flames
Ain't it a shame
To be shot down in flames
Hey you Angus, shoot me, shoot
That's nice, wow
Uh, oh oh, woooooh
Shot down in flames
Shot down in flames
Ain't it a shame
To be shot down in flames
Oh
Shot
Shot down in flames
Shot down in flames
Ain't it a shame
To be shot down in flames
I don't want to be in pain
Don't want to be shot down in flames
