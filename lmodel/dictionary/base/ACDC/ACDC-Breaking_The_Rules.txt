<song artist="AC/DC" title="Breaking_The_Rules">
Black sheep and a renegade 
Hot feet in the cool of the shade 
The street jungle and the tough childhoods 
Examinations done no good 
Got crow bars and hot wired cars 
Sneak thieves and cheap cigars 
No rebellion, not today 
I get my kicks in my own way, right OK 
Just keep on breakin' the rules
C'mon get ready to rule 
Just keep on breakin' the rules 
C'mon get ready to rule 
Tough breaks in the neighbourhood
A hard case who's up to no good 
Livin' like trash, a society rash 
Ready to break and ready to dash 
A bad deal and a real rough ride 
Ain't doin' time on the other side 
No rebellion, not today 
I get my kicks in my own way, right OK 
Just keep on breakin' the rules
C'mon get ready to rule 
Just keep on breakin' the rules 
C'mon get ready to rule 
Tough breaks 
They got the regulation ties, regulation shoes
Those regulation fools with their regulation rules
Just keep on breakin' the rules
C'mon get ready to rule 
Just keep on breakin' the rules 
C'mon get ready to rule 
Just keep on breakin' the rules, breakin' the rules 
Get ready 
You just keep on breakin' the rules 
C'mon get ready, get ready, get ready 
Ready to rule 
Take off your ties and your regulation shoes 
You're nothing but a bunch of regulation fools, yeah 
And your damn regulation rules 
I'm gonna do things my own way, everyday, everyday, everyday 
In every way, I ain't gonna pay no attention to your rules
