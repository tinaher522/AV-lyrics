<song artist="AC/DC" title="Shake_Your_Foundations">
You gotta see me leanin' on the bar
I got my head in a whiskey jar (jugÂ ?)
Feelin' good 'cause the city's alive
I'm gettin' ready to rock and jive
I get up and I slide across the floor
You wanna come and I'll meet you at the door
No one can stop us 'cause we're feelin' too right
We're gonna steal our way around tonight
(Alright, alright)
Aye, aye, oh, shake your foundations
Aye, aye, oh, shake it to the floor
Aye, aye, oh, shake your foundations
Aye, aye, oh, shake it
I was takin' no liberties
She's gettin' hotter off the heat on me
I was oilin', she was slick
Lickin' off the sweat, her favorite trick
She cried help me, help me, please
Tame this animal, help me to breathe
I said no, no way
You gotta come with me all of the way
(OK, I'll play)
Aye, aye, oh, shake your foundations
Aye, aye, oh, shake it to the floor
Aye, aye, oh, shake your foundations
Aye, aye, oh, shake it
Aye, aye, oh, shake your foundations
Aye, aye, oh, shake it to the floor
Aye, aye, oh, shake your foundations
Aye, aye, oh, shake it
We had the night, we had the time
She had the sugar and I had the wine
Took my hand, shook me to the core
Told her not to touch, but she was coming back for more
(You know what for)
Aye, aye, aye, aye
Aye, aye, oh, shake your foundations
Aye, aye, oh, shake it to the floor
Aye, aye, oh, shake your foundations
Aye, aye, oh, shake it
