<song artist="AC/DC" title="Emission_Control">
It is my mission
To seek you out
You're up for grabs, honey
Breathe in, don't make a sound
Getting it up
Getting high off the ground
Heating it up
Not fooling around
Ripping it up
You can't be here and be shy
Raising it up
Systems to the sky
Calling emission control
Emission control
Calling emission control
Emission control
It's good for the soul, yeah
Turn on ignition
The engine comes alive
She takes to purring mama
Like a lion ready to strike
A-ready to strike
Hey, yeah
Power it up
Take full flight and fly
Power it up
You got to raise it on high
Raising it up
You can't be here and be shy
Raising it up
Systems to the sky
Keeping it up
Keeping it up
Calling emission control
Emission control
Calling emission control
Emission control
Ah, it's good for the soul 
Giving it up
Giving it up
Raising it up
Just giving it up
Keeping it up
Keeping it up
Raising it up
