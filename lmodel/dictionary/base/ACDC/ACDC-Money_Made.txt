<song artist="AC/DC" title="Money_Made">
Work, work, money made
Work, work, money made
Work, work, money made
Work, work, money made
Then went down to L.A.
They roped 'em in, she couldn't get away
Spending cash all about, yeah
The die was cast
There's no getting out amount of money made
Work, work, money made
Champagne life, high on display
Work, work, money made
Work, work, money made
You keep it up, you get it made
Work, work, money made
Yeah, can't bring me into Hollywood
See you livin' it up, it feels mighty good
Recommendations all around
Come taste the sweet life
That's what it's all about, that money made
Work, work, money made
Champagne life, high on display
Work, work, money made
Work, work, money made
You keep it up, you make the grade
Work, work, money made
Ooh, yeah, yeah
Ooh, that money made
Ooh, that money made
Hit the gas
That kind of life is good for her
Getting out of bed nearly half past four
Her swimming pool is the biggest about
So don't you call her, 'cause she ain't around
That money made
Ooh, money made
Ooh, that money made
Work, work, money made, that money made
Work, work, money made, strings of pearls all kinds of change
Work, work, money made, that money made
Work, work, money made, shake baby shake
Shake it baby shake it, shake baby shake
Shake baby shake, shake baby shake, shake baby shake
