<song artist="AC/DC" title="Skies_On_Fire">
Why don't you hang up
Won't you back up
Pack up and head for higher ground
I know you and you know me
Tell me what is you want it to be
What you want to be
What you need in me
Hey, hey, hey
Skies on fire
Flames burn higher
Skies on fire
Flames get higher
I know you now, you know me
Tell me what it is you want it to be
In the rain and in the streets
You're amazed by all the things that you see
Tell me what I see
How it's got to be
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Skies on fire
Flames burn higher
Skies on fire
Flames burn higher
Hey, hey, hey
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey you look in the sky
Skies on fire
Look in the sky
Flames burn higher
Skies on fire
Flames get higher
Skies on fire
I know you and you know me
(Flames burn higher)
Tell me what is it you want me to be
Flames burn higher
(Skies on fire)
Hey, hey, hey
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Skies on fire
