<song artist="AC/DC" title="Ruff_Stuff">
I like 'em big and I like 'em small
And if I had to take the oath I would take them all
Give me that ruff stuff
(It's what I want)
She's a saint, she's a sinner
She's a rave, rave, rave
She's a woman, she's a winner
In every way, way, way
She don't want love
Nor cabaret that's out
She like to play around
That suits me fine
I like it better when she read my mind
You know, don't want a woman with a ball and chain
Don't want to play that game
Just give me that ruff stuff
I want ruff stuff
Baby give me ruff stuff
You don't want ruff stuff?
Don't want your face around here
Make you shake, make you shiver
Make you pray, pray, pray
Gonna make you quake, make you quiver
And turn you grey, grey, grey
I don't need brakes
They slow me down too much
They keep me out of touch
They lock me in
I like it better when I pull the pin
You know, don't want a woman with a ball and chain
Don't want to play that game
Just give me that ruff stuff
I want ruff stuff
Baby give me ruff stuff
You don't want ruff stuff?
Don't want your face around here
I like them big and I like them small
And if they asked me to take the oath,
I would have to take them all
Give me that ruff stuff
Don't want your face round here
I don't want your face round my backyard any more
