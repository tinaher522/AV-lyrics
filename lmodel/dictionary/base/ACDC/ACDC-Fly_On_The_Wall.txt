<song artist="AC/DC" title="Fly_On_The_Wall">
You can dance through the night
Rock n roll music itching to fight
Makin love drunk or stoned
Lookin for dollars
Get broken-boned
It's a game too tough to tame
Ends up the same
Sweatin out the rain
I was trapped like a fly on the wall
I was caged lke a zoo animal
No escape from the fate that you make
You're a snake, I've had all I can take
Watch out, there's a fly on the wall
Take a chance, take a bite
Rock n roll devil, take me tonight
Like a bitch makin heat
Beatin on my chest
Lickin at my feet
It's a game too tough to tame
Ending up the same
Sweatin in the rain
So watch out, there's a fly on the wall
I was trapped like a fly on the wall
I was caged like a zoo animal
No escape from the fate that you make
You're a snake, I've had all I can take
There's a fly on the wall
