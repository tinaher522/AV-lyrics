<song artist="AC/DC" title="Wheels">
She was a danger, aint no stranger
You give me rock 'n' roll, around the town
Just foolin' around
Ooh, she's gonna break ya
Wanna make ya, gonna make it
Wanna take it down
She's gonna rock 'n' roll 'n' slide it down
Wheel
Spinnin' around my brain, driving you insane
Wheels
Rolling 'round my head, going through the red
Ooh, she wanna shake you, no way to save you
She's got me shot, I'm fallin'
I'm blowin' it out,
Know what I'm talkin' about
Ooh, she's gonna ride you, wanna slide you
Ain't no fakin' she wanna take you out
You betcha right, she's gonna spin you 'round
Wheels
Spinnin' around my brain, driving you insane
Wheels
Rolling 'round my head, going through the red
Wheels
Flyin' down the road, ready to explode
Wheels
Burnin' up the road, hitting overload
Yeah, wheels
Spinnin' around my brain, driving you insane
Wheels
Rolling 'round my head, going through the red
Wheels
Flyin' down the road, ready to explode
Wheels
Burnin' up the road, hitting overload
Wheels
Hitting overload
Wheels
Ready to explode
