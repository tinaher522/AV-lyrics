<song artist="AC/DC" title="Given_The_Dog_A_Bone">
She takes you down easy
Going down to her knees
Going down to the devil
Down down to ninety degrees
Oh, she's blowing me crazy
'Til my ammunition is dry
Oh, She's using her head again
She's using her head
Oh, She's using her head again
I'm just a givin' the dog a bone
Givin' the dog a bone
Givin' the dog a bone
Givin' the dog a bone
I'm just a givin' the dog a bone
Givin' the dog a bone
I'm just a givin' the dog a bone
Givin' the dog a bone
Yeow
She's no Mona Lisa
No, she's no Playboy star
But she'll send you to heaven
Then explode you to Mars
Oh, she's using her head again
Using her head again
She's using her head
Using her head again
Oh, she's using her head again
Using her head
I'm just a givin' the dog a bone
Givin' the dog a bone
Givin' the dog a bone
Givin' the dog a bone
I'm just a givin' the dog a bone
Givin' the dog a bone
I'm just a givin' the dog a bone
Givin' the dog a bone
Let's go
Oooh, oh, oh, oh
She got the power of union
Yeah, she only hits when it's hot
And if she likes what you're doing
Yeah, she'll give you alot
(Given everything she got)
I've just given the dog a bone
Givin' the dog a bone
Givin' the dog a bone
Givin' the dog a bone
Givin' the dog a bone
Givin' the dog a bone
I've just given the dog a bone
Givin' the dog a bone
I'm just givin' the dog a bone
Givin' the dog a bone
Givin' the dog a bone
Givin' the dog a bone
I'm just a givin' the dog a bone
Givin' the dog a bone
I'm just a given a dog
Givin' a dog
Givin' a dog
Ooooh
I'm just a givin' a dog a bone
