<song artist="AC/DC" title="Night_Prowler">
Somewhere a clock strikes midnight
And there's a full moon in the sky
You hear a dog bark in the distance
You hear someone's baby cry
A rat runs down the alley 
And a chill runs down your spine
And someone walks across a grave
And you wish the sun would shine
'Cause no one's gonna warn ya
And no one's gonna yell "Attack"
And you don't feel the steel
Til it's hanging out your back
I'm your night prowler
Asleep in the day
Night prowler
Get out of my way
Yeah I'm your night prowler
Watch out  tonight
Yes I'm your night prowler
When you turn off the light 
Too scared to turn your light out
'Cause there's something on your mind
Was there a noise outside the window?
What's that shadow on the blind?
As you lie there naked 
Like a body in a tomb
Suspended animation
As I slip into your room
I'm your Night Prowler
Asleep in the day
Yeah, I'm your Night Prowler
Get outta my way
Look out for the Night Prowler
Watch out tonight
Yes, I'm your Night Prowler
When you turn off the light
I'm your Night Prowler
Asleep in the day
Yes, I'm your Night Prowler
Get outta my way
Look out for the Night Prowler
Watch out tonight
Yes, I'm your Night Prowler
When you turn off the light
I'm your Night Prowler
Break down your door
I'm your Night Prowler
Crawling cross your floor
I'm your Night Prowler
Make a mess of you (yes I will)
Night Prowler
And I'm telling this to you
There ain't nothing
There ain't nothing
There's nothing you can do

Na-nu, na-nu
