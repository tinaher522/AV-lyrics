<song artist="AC/DC" title="Boogie_Man">
Some people say I'm only out at night
Maybe those folks might of got it right
And some people say I drive a Cadillac car
Or sell my wares hauntin' hotel bars
I'm the boogie man, the boogie man
I like fine suits, smoke the best cigars
Like talking sex to women, girls in fast cars
I might be under the bed, ready to bite
So little girl, be careful, when you're on your own tonight
I'm your boogie man, your boogie man
And I hope, that you don't 
Misunderstand your boogie man
I'm your boogie man, I'm your boogie man
Yes I'm your boogie man, I'm your boogie man
And I hope, that you don't 
Misunderstand your boogie man
And don't let the sun 
Come up on me, your boogie man
I'm your boogie man, your boogie man
I'm your boogie man, the boogie man!
I'm the boogie man! Boogie man!
Boogie man! I'm your boogie man!
Yeah, yeah!
I'm your boogie man! I'm your boogie man!
Boogie man..........
