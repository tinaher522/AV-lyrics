<song artist="AC/DC" title="Bad_Boy_Boogie">
On the day I was born the rain fell down
There was trouble brewin' in my home town
It was the seventh day, I was the sixth son
And it scared the hell out of everyone
They said stop, I said go
They said fast, I said slow
They said yes, I said no
I do the bad boy boogie
Bein' a bad boy ain't that bad
I had me more dirty women than most men ever had
All you women come along with me
And I'll show you how good a bad boy can be
I said right and they said left
I said east and they said west
I said up and they said down
I do the bad boy boogie all over town
I wouldn't tell you no story, tell you no lie
I was born to love till the day I die
I just line 'em up and I knock 'em down
And they all came a runnin' when the word got around
Just keep a runnin'
(Bad boy boogie)
I said up, they said down
(Bad boy boogie)
They said straight, I said round
(Bad boy boogie)
They said lost, I said found
(Bad boy boogie)
I said free and they said bound
Bad boy boogie
Do the bad boy boogie
Bad boy boogie
Bad boy boogie
