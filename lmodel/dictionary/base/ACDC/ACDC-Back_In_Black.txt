<song artist="AC/DC" title="Back_In_Black">
Back in black
I hit the sack
I've been too long, I'm glad to be back
Yes, I'm let loose
From the noose
That's kept me hanging around
I been lookin' at the sky
'Cause it's gettin' me high
Forget the hearse 'cause I'll never die
I got nine lives
Cat's eyes
Abusin' every one of them and running wild
'Cause I'm back
Yes, I'm back
Well, I'm back
Yes, I'm back
Well, I'm
Back
Back
Well, I'm back in black
Yes, I'm back in black, yow
Back in the back of a Cadillac
Number one with a bullet
I'm a power pack
Yes, I'm in a band with a gang
They've got to catch me if they want me to hang
'Cause I'm back on the track
And I'm beatin' the flack
Nobody's gonna get me on another rap
So look at me now
I'm just makin' my play
Don't try to push your luck
Just get out of my way
'Cause I'm back
Yes, I'm back
Well, I'm back
Yes, I'm back
Well I'm
Back
Back
Well, I'm back in black
Yes, I'm back in black
Well, I'm back
Yes, I'm back
Well, I'm back
Yes, I'm back
Well, I'm
Back
Back
Well, I'm back in black
Yes, I'm back in black, ow
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Yes, I am
Hey, yeah
Yeah
Oh, yeah
Back in now
Well, I'm
Back (I'm back)
Back (I'm back)
Back (I'm back)
Back (I'm back)
Back (I'm back)
Back (I'm back)
Back in black
Yes, I'm back in black
Out of sight
