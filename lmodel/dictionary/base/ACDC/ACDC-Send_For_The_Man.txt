<song artist="AC/DC" title="Send_For_The_Man">
You want love
Dirty dirty love
You want lust
Just a little lust
You wan' a bad reputation
You wanna better your score
I got the qualifications
I can open any door (ooh
yeah)
Send for the man, yeah
Send for thh man, yeah
You like a dream
Dirty low and mean
You're good enough to eat
Sticky hot and sweet
Need a shot of rhythm and
lovin'
You make a black sheep a ram
This ain't a gun in my
pocket
I got the goods in my hand
Send for the man, yeah
Send for thh man, yeah
