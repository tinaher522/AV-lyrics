Yeah, yeah 
Roll
Yeow
Roll
Well, I'm heading on out
Down to a major town
I'm getting hungry, I'm getting neat
I'm getting down on Easy Street 
With any luck I'll get by
I'm feeling good and I'm getting wild
I'm in town, ready to go
I'll be around and I'll let you know
I got some rock &amp; roll thunder
Some rock &amp; roll thunder
Listen
Roll
Hey, hey, hey
Roll 
Hey 
I've been working wheels that roll
I get high on rock and roll
I get the beat, babe, on Easy Street
I don't get anger, I got it made
Down on your luck, I get around
I'm here to help you, show you what I've found
Tailor made for you, the party's in town
I'm tailor made for you, come see what I have found
I got some rock &amp; roll thunder
I got some rock &amp; roll thunder
Hey, hey, what do you know?
I'm feeling great and ready to roll
I got the rock &amp; roll thunder
Roll
Hey, hey, hey
Roll
Hey, hey, hey
I got some rock &amp; roll thunder
Some rock &amp; roll thunder
Hey, hey, what do you know?
I said, feeling great and we're ready to roll
I got the rock &amp; roll thunder
The rock &amp; roll thunder
I said, the rock &amp; roll thunder
Rock &amp; roll thunder
Roll 
Roll
