<song artist="AC/DC" title="Strap_It_On">
Be a good dog! (dog barks and laughter in background)
I want more honey for my money
Turn your head so you don't look funny
Lay on your back, turn to side
Down on your front, now let me ride
Strap it on
Strap it on
Strap it on
Strap it on
I never wear out
But if I do brought somethin' special
That you'll like too
So turn around and hold real tight
Up off the ground, we'll go all night
Strap it on
Strap it on
Strap it on
Strap it on (Feels so right!)
Strap it on
Strap it on
Strap it on
Strap it on (Keep it up all night!)
Strap it on
Strap it on
Strap it on
Strap it on
Strap it on
Strap it on 
Strap it on
Strap it on
Oh yeah...
