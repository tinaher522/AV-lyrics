<song artist="AC/DC" title="Rocking_All_The_Way">
Well, one mad shuffle
He says two women is trouble, yeah
Sweat out a duel
I'm humming right at you
I said you didn't even rate
Commin' on at night
You know to come along with you
You've gotta run away and hide
Two by two
Well, I said I'm commin' right at you, ooh
She's rockin' all the way
She's comin' out my way
She's goin' all the way
She's comin' out to play, yes sir
She's sexy in her boots
Tear up all the news
Shoot you in the back, driving you mad
Come on hear me out, and take my advice
She won't stop until you're in her sights
She's rockin' all the way
She's comin' out my way
She's goin' all the way
She's comin' out today, yeah
She's rockin' all the way
She's comin' out to play
She's goin' all the way
My, my, my, my all the way
She's rockin' all the way
She's comin' out my way
She's goin' all the way
She's comin' out to play, yeah
One man shuffle, two women trouble
Gonna kick ya right off the track
Ya gotta push it, lug it
Thrust her over it
She's gonna make it pay, all the way
She's comin' out my way
She rockin' all the way
