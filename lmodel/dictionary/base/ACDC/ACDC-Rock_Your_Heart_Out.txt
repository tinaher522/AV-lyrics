<song artist="AC/DC" title="Rock_Your_Heart_Out">
(Ooh yeah
Ooooooh yeah, yeah
Yeah)
Got the devil in you
Got the devil in me
Play a dangerous tune
Come on and dance with thee
You got to throw your fists up
Shout your mouth out
Beat the walls down
Got to freak out
Rock your little
Rock your little
Rock your little heart out
(yeah
Yeah, yeah)
(You gotta rock it on down)
(yeah down)
Got everything you want
Got everything you need
Don't worry about the cost
Just sell your soul to me
You gotta bring the house down
Beat the drums loud
Bleed your life dry
Climb on lets fly
Rock your little
Rock your little
Rock your little heart out
Rock, rock your little heart out
(Rock it on down)
(ooh yeah)
(Cut your teeth on this)
(yeah)
You gotta put your foot down
Beat your chest hard
Blow your brains out
Feel her shout loud
You gotta rock your heart out
Rock your heart out
Rock your heart out
Rock your heart out
Rock, rock your little heart out
Rock, rock your little heart out
You rock it on down, ooh yeah
Rock a little, rock a little heart out, yeah, yeah
You gotta
Rock your heart out
Rock your heart out
Rock your heart out
Rock your heart out
Rock, rock, rock your heart out
Rock, rock, rock your heart out
Rock, rock, rock your heart out
Rock, rock, rock your heart out
Rock, rock, rock your heart right out
Rock, rock, rock your little heart out
Rock your heart out
You gotta
Rock your little, rock your little, rock your little heart out
You gotta rock your little heart
Right, right out
