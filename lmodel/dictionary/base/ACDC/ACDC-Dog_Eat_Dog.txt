<song artist="AC/DC" title="Dog_Eat_Dog">
Well it's a dog eat dog
Eat cat too
The French eat frog
And I eat you
Business man when you make a deal
Do you know who you can trust?
Do you sign your life away?
Do you write your name in dust?
Hey, hey, hey
Every dog has its day
It's a dog eat dog, dog eat dog
Dog eat dog
Read the news
Someone win
Someone lose
Up's above and down's below
And limbo's in between
Up you win, down you lose
It's anybody's game
Hey, hey, hey
Every dog has its day
It's a dog eat dog
Dog eat dog
And it's a eye for eye
Tooth for tooth
It's a lie
That's the truth
See the blind man on the street
Lookin' for somethin' free
Hear the kind man ask his friend
Hey, what's in it for me?
Hey, hey, hey
Every dog has its day
It's a dog eat dog
Dog eat dog
Dog eat dog, dog eat dog
Dog eat dog, dog eat dog
Hey, dog eat dog, dog eat dog
Dog eat dog, dog eat dog
Dog eat dog, dog eat dog
Dog eat dog, dog eat dog
Dog eat dog
