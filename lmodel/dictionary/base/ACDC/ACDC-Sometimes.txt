<song artist="AC/DC" title="Sometimes">
I got your message
It screamed aloud
Your dancing and your singing
Gave it a shroud
We all may have laughed
As they dragged us down
Now all the clear is mundane
With a broken, crooked crown
Sometimes
I don't feel your love
Sometimes
I can only hope to stay alive
Sometimes
You come and take me away
I feel like the chatter
Cleared my head
But always your ways
Left me better off for dead
The chance of reason shook
Away the way
Now all is a Sunday
For a man who's lost his way
Sometimes
I don't feel your love
Sometimes
I can only hope to stay alive
Sometimes
You come and take me away
Don't lean back too far
As the colors fade to gray
Don't breathe in too much
Or the weight will blow you away
Do you give a little in?
All that's left is sometimes right
Your happiness danced away
Far away...
To the distance in the twilight
Sometimes
I don't feel your love
Sometimes
I can only hope to stay alive
Sometimes
You come and take me away
