<song artist="AC/DC" title="Let_Me_Put_My_Love_Into_You">
Flying on a free flight, driving all night 
With my machinery
'Cause I, I got the power any hour
To show the man in me
I got reputations blown to pieces
With my artillery
Well, I'll be guiding and we'll be riding
Giving what you got to me
Don't you struggle
Don't you fight 
Don't you worry
'Cause it's your turn tonight
Let me put my love into you babe
Let me put my love on the line
Let me put my love into you babe
Let me cut your cake with my knife
Like a fever burning faster 
You spark a fire in me
Crazy feelings got me reeling 
They got me raising steam
Now, don't you struggle
Don't you fight 
Don't you worry
'Cause it's your turn tonight, yeah
Let me put my love into you babe 
Let me put my love on the line
Let me put my love into you babe
Let me cut your cake with my knife
Oh, cut it
Let me
Let me
Oh
Let me put my love into you babe 
Let me put my love on the line
Let me put my love into you babe
Let me cut your cake with my knife
Let me put my love into you babe 
Let me put my love on the line
Let me put my love into you babe
Let me give it all
Let me give it all
To you
To you
Give it all
