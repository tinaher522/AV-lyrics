<song artist="AC/DC" title="Big_Balls">
Well, I'm ever upper class high society
God's gift to ballroom notoriety
And I always fill my ballrooms
The event is never small
The social pages say I've got
The biggest balls of all
I've got big balls
I've got big balls
And they're such big balls
And their dirty big balls
And he's got big balls
And she's got big balls
(But we've got the biggest balls of them all)
And my balls are always bouncing
My ballroom always full
And everybody comes and comes again
If your name is on the guest list
No one can take you higher
Everybody says I've got
Great balls of fire
I've got big balls
Oh, I've got big balls
And they're such big balls
Dirty big balls
And he's got big balls
And she's got big balls
(But we've got the biggest balls of them all)
Some balls are held for charity
And some for fancy dress
But when they're held for pleasure
They're the balls that I like best
My balls are always bouncing
To the left and to the right
It's my belief that my big balls
Should be held every night
We've got big balls
We've got big balls
We've got big balls
Dirty big balls
He's got big balls
She's got big balls
(But we've got the biggest balls of them all)
(Oh, we've got big balls)
(We've got big balls)
And I'm just itching to tell you about them
(We've got big balls)
Oh we had such wonderful fun
(We've got big balls)
Seafood cocktail, crabs, crayfish
(But we've got the biggest balls of them all)
(Bollocks, knackers)
(Bollocks, knackers)
(Bollocks, knackers)
(Bollocks, knackers)
(Bollocks, knackers)
(Bollocks, knackers)
(Bollocks, knackers)
(Bollocks, knackers)
(Bollocks, knackers)
(Bollocks, knackers)
(Bollocks, knackers)
