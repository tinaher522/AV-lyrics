Dogs of war (soldier of fortune)
Dogs of war (soldier of fortune)
Dogs of war (soldier of fortune)
Dogs of war (soldier of fortune)
Dogs of war 
You be a fighting man
Make all the cash you can
Don't need civilian ties
They learn to risk their lives
Taking all you can
Risk any in the plan
Feel the boots upon the ground
Trouble brewing all around
Dodging the bullets
Shooting the missiles
Soldiers of fortune
Such a pretty name
Face the game
Mercenary man
We'll be the dogs of war (soldier of fortune)
We'll be the dogs of war (soldier of fortune)
Call in the dogs of war (soldier of fortune)
Send in the dogs of war (soldier of fortune)
I'll fight, fight in the night
Run away or die of fright
Keep in time, keep in line
Where there's smoke, there's fire
Dodging the bullets
Shooting the missiles
Soldiers of fortune
Such a pretty name
Face the game
You mercenary man
We'll be the dogs of war (soldier of fortune)
We'll be the dogs of war (soldier of fortune)
Call in the dogs of war (soldier of fortune)
Send in the dogs of war (soldier of fortune) 
We'll be the dogs of war (soldier of fortune)
We'll be the dogs of war (soldier of fortune)
Call in the dogs of war (soldier of fortune)
Send in the dogs of war (soldier of fortune) 
They're marching through the madness
Those mercenary men 
Dogs of war
Dogs of war
Dogs of war
