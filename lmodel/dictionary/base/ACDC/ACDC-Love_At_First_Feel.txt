<song artist="AC/DC" title="Love_At_First_Feel">
You never told me where you came from
You never told me your name
I didn't know if you were legal tender
But I spent you just the same
I didn't think it could happen to me
But I fell in love in the first degree
It was love at first feel            
(I was touched with too much)
They told me it was disgustin
They told me it was a sin
They saw me knocking on your front door
And they saw me smile when you let me in
You and me baby we're all alone
Let's get something goin
While your mum and dad ain't home
It was love at first feel
(Feel good just like I knew it would)
