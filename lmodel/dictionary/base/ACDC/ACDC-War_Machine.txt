<song artist="AC/DC" title="War_Machine">
Push your foot to the floor
Don't need no more
You've been dickin' all around
While they're messin' about
Better get your name, come on in
Gimme that thing and feed your war
War Machine (War machine)
War Machine (War machine)
Make a stand, show your hand
Call in the high command
Don't think, just obey
I'm like a bird of prey
So better get your name, come on in
Gimme that thing and feed your war
War Machine (War machine)
War Machine (War machine)
Better watch your back
And cover your tracks
Kick your foot through the door
Hit the deck, know the score
They take you by surprise
And here's mud in your eye
This will be the day they shouldn't forget
Call of the wild, hungry for more
And feed your war
War Machine (War machine)
War Machine (War machine)
Let's go
I've seen your war
War Machine (War machine)
War Machine (War machine)
War Machine (War machine)
War Machine (War machine)
War Machine (War machine)
