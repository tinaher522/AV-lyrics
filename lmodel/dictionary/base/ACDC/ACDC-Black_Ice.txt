<song artist="AC/DC" title="Black_Ice">
Well the devil may care
You toss him back and be a man
With the last time
Black ice
End of it all, end of the line
End of the road
Ooh, black ice
Black ice
Come on and bleeding out the walls
We're watching all the women go
Many a mile I'll never take
I run for forty miles and I come up runnin' late
Don't you know I live it down
When the devil come a callin' I aint gonna be around
Ooh, black ice
Black ice, yeah
Black ice, my yeah
The devil come a callin' I aint gonna be around
Black ice
Livin' long, livin' long
Sleep all alone, you're gonna take it all
And I'm gonna rip it out
I'll kick, I creep crawl down your street
I'll gouge your eyes out, yeah
Ooh, black ice
Black ice
Black ice
Black ice
My life
Black ice
My life
Black ice
My life, ooh
When the devil come a callin' I aint gonna be around
I'll kick, I creep crawl down your street, and gouge your eyes out
Black ice
