<song artist="AC/DC" title="Rock_And_Roll_Ain't_Noise_Pollution">
(All right)
Hey there, all you middlemen
Throw away your fancy clothes
Way out there, sittin' on a fence
So get off your ass and come down here
'Cause rock 'n' roll ain't no riddle, man
To me, it makes good, good sense
Good sense
Ow, ooh yeah
Heavy decibels are playing on my guitar
We got vibrations comin' up from the floor
We're just listenin' to the rock
That's givin' too much noise
Are you deaf? You wanna hear some more?
We're just talkin' about the future
Forget about the past
It'll always be with us, it's never gonna die
Never gonna die
Rock 'n' roll ain't noise pollution
Rock 'n' roll ain't gonna die
Rock 'n' roll ain't noise pollution
Rock 'n' roll it will survive
Yes, it will, ha ha ha ha
I took a look inside your bedroom door
You looked so good lyin' on your bed
Well, I asked you if you wanted it in rhythm and love
You said you wanna rock 'n' roll instead
We're just talkin' about the future
Forget about the past
It'll always be with us, it's never gonna die
Never gonna die
Rock 'n' roll ain't noise pollution
Rock 'n' roll ain't gonna die
Rock 'n' roll ain't no pollution
Rock 'n' roll is just rock 'n' roll
Oh, rock 'n' roll ain't noise pollution
Rock 'n' roll ain't gonna die
Rock 'n' roll ain't no pollution
Rock 'n' roll it will survive
Rock 'n' roll ain't no pollution
Rock 'n' roll, it'll never die
Rock 'n' roll  ain't no pollution
Rock 'n' roll, oh, rock 'n' roll
Is just rock 'n' roll, yeah
