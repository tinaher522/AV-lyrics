<song artist="AC/DC" title="Spoilin'_For_A_Fight">
I see trouble coming man
Well I'm coming to a fork
Sliding down a road
Gonna lick 'em on down
We're gonna run right out
Well, I'm a fighting fool
And I'm hungry for you
Well I'm living on a line
I'm protecting my life
Rock with me
Come on, come on
You're all, yeah, spoilin' for a fight
Spoilin' for a fight
Spoilin' for a fight, yeah
Spoilin' for a fight
Spoilin' for a fight
Spoilin' for a fight, yeah
Make your heart beat thump
And make your stomach jump, yeah
You're running all the time, yeah
And then you're fighting all night
With my rocking shoes
'Cause I'm hungry for you
Well I'm living on the line, yeah
All my life
Rock with me
Come on, come on, you want it
Spoilin' for a fight
Spoilin' for a fight
Tryin' to make it right
Spoilin' for a fight
Spoilin' for a fight
Trying to make it right, yeah
You better stand your ground
And keep out of my town
To live another day
Well yeah,
Come on,
Stand up
Spoilin' for a fight
Spoilin' for a fight
Trying to make it right
Spoilin' for a fight
I said I'm spoilin' for a fight
'Cause I've gotta make it right
Fighting all night
'Cause I'm spoilin' for a fight
