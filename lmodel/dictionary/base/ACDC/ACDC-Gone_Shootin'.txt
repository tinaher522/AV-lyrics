<song artist="AC/DC" title="Gone_Shootin'">
Feel the pressure rise
Hear the whistle blow
Bought a ticket on her own accord
To I don't know
Packed her heart in a traveling bag
And never said bye bye
Something's missing in the neighborhood
All the cryin' eyes
I stirred my coffee with the same spoon
To a favorite tune
Gone shootin'
My baby's gone shootin'
Wrap yourself around
Like a second skin
backed her favorite nag
But she could never win
I took her number in another town
She took another pill
She was running in overdrive
Up until my overkill
She never made it passed the bedroom door
What was she aiming for?
Gone shootin'
She's gone, gone gone gone
Gone shootin'
My baby's gone shootin'
Gone shootin'
Got everything you could ever want
She's gone, gone gone gone, she's gone
Gone shootin'
