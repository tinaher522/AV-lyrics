<song artist="AC/DC" title="Rock_N_Roll_Damnation">
They say that you play too loud
Well babe that's tough
They say that you got too much
Can't get enough
They tell you that you look a fool
And baby I'm a fool for you
They say that your mind's diseased
Shake your stuff
And it's a rock 'n' roll damnation
Ma's own whippin' boy
Rock 'n' roll damnation
Take a chance while you still got the choice
You say that you want respect
Honey for what?
For everything that you've done for me
Thanks a lot
Get up off your bended knees
You could set your mind at ease
My temperature's running hot
I've been waiting all night for a bite of what you got
And it's a rock 'n' roll damnation
Ma's own whippin' boy
Rock 'n' roll damnation
Take a chance while you still got the choice
Damnation, they're puttin' you down
Damnation, all over town
Damnation, cause you're way outta reach
Livin' on the streets you gotta practice what you preach
And it's a rock 'n' roll damnation
Ma's own whippin' boy
Rock 'n' roll damnation
Take a chance while you still got the choice
Damnation, left a happy home
Damnation, to live on your own
Damnation, you want to live in sin
Damnation, it's a rock 'n' roll
Damnation, just a bundle of joy
Damnation, you're a toy for a boy
Damnation, you got dollars in your eye
Damnation, chasin' that pie in the sky
Damnation, rock 'n' roll
Damnation
