<song artist="AC/DC" title="Love_Song">
I can tell by the look in your eye
I can tell by the way you sigh
That you know I've been thinking of you
And you know what I want to do
Oh Jean, Oh Jean
Oh Jean, Oh Jean
When you smile I see stars in the sky
When you smile I see sunrise
And I know you've been thinking of me
And I know how you want it to be
Oh Jean, Oh Jean
Oh Jean, Oh Jean
I can tell by the things you say
I can tell that you know the way
And I know what you want me to do
Oh, I've got hearts and flowers for you
If you leave me, you'll make me cry
When I think of you saying goodbye
Oh the sky turns to a deeper blue
That's, that's how I'd feel if I lost you
Jean, Oh Jean
Don't go and leave me
'Cause I love, I love you, I love you, don't leave me
It would make me cry, if you said goodbye
Don't go away Jean, don't you leave baby baby
