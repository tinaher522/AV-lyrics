<song artist="AC/DC" title="Burnin'_Alive">
Burnin' alive, set my soul on fire
Runnin' with a gun, this place is gonna burn
No firewater, or novocaine
No thunderstorm, no John Wayne
No kids to rock, nowhere to run
So watch out, 'cause this place is gonna burn
Burnin' alive, burnin' alive
They be smokin' your hide, come runnin' wild
Tell you nothin' to fear, cause the buck stops here
He came from a little town called Hope
And someday maybe, it'll go up in smoke
No firewater, or novocaine
No thunderstorm, no John Wayne
No kids to rock, nowhere to run
So watch out, 'cause this place is gonna burn
Burnin' alive, burnin' alive
Burnin' alive, burnin' alive
It's an all out war, an all out war
Burnin' alive, burnin' alive
Somewhere, there's a little town called Hope
And someday maybe baby, he'll inhale that smoke
Burnin' alive, burnin' alive
Burnin' alive, burnin' alive
It's an all out war, an all out war
Burnin' alive, burnin' alive
(Watch the place burn down)
