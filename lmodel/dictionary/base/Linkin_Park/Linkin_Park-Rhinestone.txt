<song artist="Linkin_Park" title="Rhinestone">
From the top to the bottom (Bottom to top I stop)
At the core of the rotten (Stopping just what I thought)
But sun has escaped us (So I'm bright in the sky)
And I'm far from awakeness (Thinking why did I try?)
From the top to the bottom (Bottom to top I stop)
At the core of the rotten (Stopping just what I thought)
But sun has escaped us (So I'm bright in the sky)
And I'm far from awakeness (Thinking why did I try?)
From the thread to the needle, middle to end
When skies cock back and shock that which couldn't defend
The rain then sends dripping innocent question
Forcefully, the power of suggestion
Then, with the eyes tightly shut
Looking through the rust and rotten dust
A spot of light floods the floor
Pours itself upon the world of pretend
Then the eyes ease open and it's dark again
From the top to the bottom (Bottom to top I stop)
At the core of the rotten (Stopping just what I thought)
But sun has escaped us (So I'm bright in the sky)
And I'm far from awakeness (Thinking why did I try?)
From the top to the bottom (Bottom to top I stop)
At the core of the rotten (Stopping just what I thought)
But sun has escaped us (So I'm bright in the sky)
And I'm far from awakeness (Thinking why did I try?)
In a minute you'll find me
Eyes burning up 
You say you'll never forget me
But the lies have piled up
Moving all around, screaming of the ups and downs
Pollution manifested in perpetual sound
And as the wheels go 'round, the sunset creeps past the
Street lamps, cars, chain-links, and concrete
A window then grows and captures the eye
And cries out yellow light as it passes it by
A small black figure sits in front of a box
Inside a box of rock with the needles on top
Nothing stops in this land of the chain
The brains lose not knowing they were part of the game
And then the insides go, but the box stays the same and shame
Shovel up the pieces to the pain
You can try to hide yourself in the world of pretend
But when the paper's crumpled up it can't be perfect again
From the top to the bottom (Bottom to top I stop)
At the core of the rotten (Stopping just what I thought)
But sun has escaped us (So I'm bright in the sky)
And I'm far from awakeness (Thinking why did I try?)
From the top to the bottom (Bottom to top I stop)
At the core of the rotten (Stopping just what I thought)
But sun has escaped us (So I'm bright in the sky)
And I'm far from awakeness (Thinking why did I try?)
In a minute you'll find me
Eyes burn me up
You say you'll never forget me
But the lies have piled up
Yeah I got you caught in the act
You better step back
Telling me that I'm seeing right through you
Yeah I got you caught in the act
You better step back
Telling me that I'm seeing right through you
Yeah I got you caught in the act
You better step back
Telling me that I'm seeing right through you
Yeah I got you caught in the act
You better step back
Telling me that I'm seeing right through you
Yeah I got you caught in the act
You better step back
Telling me that I'm seeing right through you
Yeah I got you caught in the act
You better step back
Telling me that I'm seeing right through you
Yeah I got you caught in the act
You better step back
Telling me that I'm seeing right through you
Yeah I got you caught in the act
You better step back
Telling me that I'm seeing right through you
In a minute you'll find me
Eyes burn me up
You say you'll never forget me
But the lies have piled up
In a minute you'll find me...
Eyes burn me up...
You say you'll never forget me...
But the lies keep piling up...
