<song artist="Linkin_Park" title="Esaul_(Underground_EP)">
Riding with the head full of buckets of red and what I said still stuck in my head
But misled thinking the things I'd do would make you never wanna come back
But when on front attacks, you could never run from that
Being trapped in this with you, something that I never wanted to do
But through it all you got to see
That where I want to be is over the pen again letting it out of me
In the centre of the day in a dream
Seeing all my thoughts getting lost in between
Realizing one, not the way that it seems
And the killing of the killer with a head full of screams
I want to live in another place where no one can say that I live for them
(Start seeing it's not meant to be for me)
I want to be in the energy, not with the enemy
A place for my head
And the second it starts, we're gonna be crushed when it all falls apart
Knowing no matter how low
Hoping that you won't know the strain it puts to me
Seeing what you've done and consequently
I've run away, just hidden again
Within the boundaries of an anguish
Don't want me to say this, but you're dragging me down
Lost in the chaos, being tossed around
Singing again to myself, a head full of hectic
Hope that someday you'll regret this
Everything's the wrong place, the wrong time
Adding to the panic of my confine
Singing again to myself, a head full of hectic
Hope that someday you'll regret this
Everything's the wrong place, the wrong time
Adding to the panic of my confine
I want to live in another place where no one can say that I live for them
(Start seeing it's not meant to be for me)
I want to be in the energy, not with the enemy
A place for my head
You try to take the best of me, go away...
You try to take the best of me, go away...
You try to take the best of me, go away...
You try to take the best of me, go away!
You try to take the best of me, go away!
You try to take the best of me, go away!
You try to take the best of me, go away!
You try to take the best of me, go away!
I want to live in another place where no one can say that I live for them
(Still I see it's not meant to be for me)
I want to be in the energy, not with the enemy
A place for my head
Take-a-way! 
Singing again to myself, a head full of hectic
Hope that someday you'll regret this
Everything's the wrong place, the wrong time
Adding to the panic of my confine
Singing again to myself, a head full of hectic
Hope that someday you'll regret this
Everything's the wrong place, the wrong time
Adding to the panic of my confine
