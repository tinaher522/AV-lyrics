(I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break)
(I'm about to break
Where's my room to breathe
Where's my room to breathe
This room to breathe)
I cannot take this anymore
Saying everything I've said before
All these words, they make no sense
I found bliss in ignorance
Less I hear, the less you say
You'll find that out anyway
I find the answers aren't so clear
Wish I could find a way to disappear
All these thoughts, they make no sense
I found bliss in ignorance
Nothing seems to go away
Over and over again, over and over again
Over and over again, over and over again
Over and over again
Just like before, like before
Like before, like before
Like before
Everything you say to me
And I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
I'm about to break
Everything you say to me
And I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
And I'm about to (break)
These are the places where I can't feel
Torn from my body, my flesh it heals
During this ride we can cut up what we like (I'm about to break)
Waiting alone I can not resist
Feeling this hate I have never missed
Please someone give me a reason to rip off my face
Blood is a-pouring and pouring and pouring...
Shut up when I'm talking to you
Shut up
(Blood is pouring)
Shut up
(Blood is pouring)
Shut up
(Blood is pouring)
Shut up when I'm talking to you
Shut up
(Blood is pouring)
Shut up
(Blood is pouring)
Shut up
(Blood is pouring)
Shut up, I'm about to break
Everything you say to me
I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
I'm about to break
Everything you say to me
And I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
And I'm about to
Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
I'm about to break
Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to-
