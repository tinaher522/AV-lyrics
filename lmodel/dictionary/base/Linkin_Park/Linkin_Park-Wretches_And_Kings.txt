<song artist="Linkin_Park" title="Wretches_And_Kings">
There's a time
When the operation of the machine
Becomes so odious
Makes you so sick at heart
That you can't take part
You can't even passively take part
And you've got to put your bodies
Upon the gears and upon the wheels
Upon the levers, upon all the apparatus
And you've got to make it stop
To save face, how low can you go?
Talk a lot of game, but yet, you don't know
Static on the way, make us all say whoa
The people up top push the people down low
Get down, and obey every word
Steady, get in line if you haven't yet heard
Wanna take what I got? Don't be absurd
Don't fight the power, nobody gets hurt
If you haven't heard yet, then I'm lettin' you know
There ain't shit we don't run when the guns unload
And no one make a move 'less my people say so
Got everything outta control, now everybody go
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Steel unload, final blow
We, the animals, take control
Hear us now, clear and true
Wretches and kings, we come for you
So keep pace, how slow can you go?
Talk a lot of shit, and yet, you don't know
Fire on the way, make you all say whoa
The people up top and the people down low
Get down, and I'm runnin' it like that
The front of the attack is exactly where I'm at
Somewhere in-between the kick and the hi-hat
The pen and the contract, the pitch and the contact
So get with the combat, I'm lettin' 'em know
There ain't shit you can say to make me back down, no
So, push the button, let the whole thing blow
Spinnin' everything outta control, now everybody go
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Steel unload, final blow
We, the animals, take control
Hear us now, clear and true
Wretches and kings, we come for you
Steel unload, fire blow
Filthy animals, beat them low
Skin and bone, black and blue
No more this sun shall beat onto you
From the front to the back and the side-to-side
If you fear what I feel, put 'em up real high
Front to the back and the side-to-side
If you fear what I feel, put 'em up real high
Front to the back and the side-to-side
If you fear what I feel, put 'em up real high
Front to the back and the side-to-side
If you fear what I feel, put 'em up real high
Front to the back and the side-to-side
If you fear what I feel, put 'em up real high
Front to the back and the side-to-side
If you fear what I feel, put 'em up real high
When the operation of the machine
Becomes so odious
Makes you so sick at heart
That you can't take part
You can't even passively take part
And you've got to put your bodies
Upon the gears and upon the wheels
Upon the levers, upon all the apparatus
And you've got to make it stop
And you've got to indicate to the people
Who run it, to the people who own it
That unless you're free, the machine
Will be prevented from working at all
