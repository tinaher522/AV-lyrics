<song artist="Linkin_Park" title="All_For_Nothing">
Yeah, uh
So whatcha waiting for?
Anticipating more?
While you debate what it could take to instigate a war
Yeah, I been hated more than time I wasn't hated for
There's nothing they can fucking say they didn't say before
And you could never see it, your battle's not mine
Wanna skate and play it safe, but this is take-a-shot time
You're waiting for a purpose, I already got mine
While you tell me, step to it, like
One, two, three, four
And if I do what you demand
(You say) You'll let me understand
(You say) You're gonna hold me to your word
And if I sell myself away
(You say) I'll have no debt to pay
(You say) I'm gonna get what I deserve
Your word, obeyed
My debt, repaid
Our trust, betrayed
All for nothing, all for nothing
Kick back, there's no other way to say it
So let me break this fucker down for ya
I really don't know ya
You talk but let me show ya where to put your paranoia
You're joking, I don't have a half a sucker bone to throw ya
I'm disgusted, wonder what could've made ya tuck your tail below ya
And no, I'm not your soldier, I'm not taking any orders
I'm a five-star general infantry controller
Need a lesson? Let me show ya
Have you checking your composure
While I make you step to it, like
One, two, three, four
And if I do what you demand
(You say) You'll let me understand
(You say) You're gonna hold me to your word
And if I sell myself away
(You say) I'll have no debt to pay
(You say) I'm gonna get what I deserve
And if I do what you demand
You'll let me understand
Your word, obeyed
My debt, repaid
Our trust, betrayed
All for nothing, all for nothing
All for nothing, all for...
