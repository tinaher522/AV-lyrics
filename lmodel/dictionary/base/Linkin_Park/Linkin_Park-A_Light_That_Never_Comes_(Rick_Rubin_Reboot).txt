<song artist="Linkin_Park" title="A_Light_That_Never_Comes_(Rick_Rubin_Reboot)">
Nah you don't know me
Lightning above and a fire below me
You cannot catch me, cannot hold me
You cannot stop, much less control me
When it rains it pours
When the floodgates open, brace your shores
That pressure don't care when it breaks your door
Say it's all you can take, better take some more
When I was young they told me, they said
Make your bed you lie in that bed
A king can't hold my rings so instead
It comes that day, it's off with his head
The night gets darkest right before dawn
What don't kill you makes you more strong
You'll have my mercy then when you're gone
'Cause I know what it's like to test fate
Had my shoulders pressed with that weight
Stood up strong in spite of that hate
The night gets darkest right before dawn
What don't kill you makes you more strong
You'll have my mercy then when you're gone
The nights go on
Waiting for a light that never comes
I chase the sun
Waiting for a light that never comes
Oh oh oh
Waiting for a light that never comes
Nah you don't know me
Lightning above and a fire below me
You cannot catch me, cannot hold me
You cannot stop, much less control me
When it rains it pours
When the floodgates open, brace your shores
That pressure don't care when it breaks your door
Say it's all you can take, better take some more
The nights go on
Waiting for a light that never comes
I chase the sun
Waiting for a light that never comes
Oh oh oh
Waiting for a light that never comes
The nights go on
Waiting for a light that never comes (Take some more)
I chase the sun
Waiting for a light that never comes
