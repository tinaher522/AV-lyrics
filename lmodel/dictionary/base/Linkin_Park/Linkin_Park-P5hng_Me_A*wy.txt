<song artist="Linkin_Park" title="P5hng_Me_A*wy">
When I look into your eyes, there's nothing there to see
Nothing but my own mistakes staring back at me...
I've lied to you...
This is the last smile that I'll fake for the sake of being with you
Everything falls apart, even the people who never frown eventually break down
Everything has to end, you'll soon find 
(For the sake of being with you)
We're out of time left to watch it all unwind
Everything falls apart, even the people who never frown eventually break down
The sacrifice is never knowing...
Why I stay when you just push away
No matter what you see, you're still so blind to me
I've tried like you, to do everything you wanted to
This is the last time, I'll take the blame for the sake of being with you!
Everything falls apart, even the people who never frown eventually break down
The sacrifice of hiding in a lie
Everything has to end, you'll soon find 
We're out of time left to watch it all unwind
The sacrifice is never knowing...
Why I stay when you just push away
No matter what you see, you're still so blind to me
Reverse psychology's failing miserably
It's so hard to be left all alone
Telling you is the only chance for me
There's nothing left but to turn and face you
When I look into your eyes, there's nothing there to see
Nothing but my own mistakes staring back at me, asking why...
The sacrifice of hiding in a lie, the sacrifice is never knowing
Why I stay when you just push away
No matter what you see, you're still so blind to me
Why I stay when you just push away
No matter what you see, you're still so blind to me
