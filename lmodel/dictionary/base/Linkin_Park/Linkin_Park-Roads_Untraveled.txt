<song artist="Linkin_Park" title="Roads_Untraveled">
Weep not for roads untravelled
Weep not for paths left alone
’Cause beyond every bend is a long blinding end
It’s the worst kind of pain I've known
Give up your heart left broken and let that mistake pass on
’Cause the love that you lost wasn't worth what it cost
And in time you’ll be glad it’s gone
Weep not for roads untraveled
Weep not for sights unseen
May your love never end, and if you need a friend
There’s a seat here alongside me
