<song artist="Linkin_Park" title="Stick_N'_Move">
This is how it's done, going for the title and crown
Renowned emcees surround as the beat breaks down
In two elements, clobbin' up those that bring the best
And as the M-I seek the way it ought to be ponnessed
Yes, yes am I the one to keep you on your toes?
Most definitely in my b-boy pose
The, uh, electric boogaloo with a slight twist
Touch your chin to your chest to the rhythm like this
Now see what I have, I want you
Be with me or stick n' move
Now see what I had, I want you
Be with me or stick n' move
MC's dogging me since the first day I grabbed the mic
Now it's like "You sit! You stay!"
Cobra path lifestyles, I'm kicking
Sticking emcees real quick 'cause times ticking
At the drop of the defence, I let loose a venom
Sending a shot of verbal heat up in 'em
The ending is done, grab your family and run
Apocalyptic rhyme pattern taking shots at the sun
Record industry rule four-thousand-eighty-one:
Question my intentions and your whole world is done
Like Forrest you'll run, turn your eyeballs into Saturn
Full metal jacket fully auto-rhyme pattern
Now see what I have, I want you
Be with me or stick n' move
Now see what I had, I want you
Be with me or stick n' move
Stick it, rock it for a click and I'm wicked
Moving, moving all my tunes and you groove it
Stick it, rock it for a click and I'm wicked
Moving, moving all my tunes and you groove it
Stick it, rock it for a click and I'm wicked (Uh!)
Moving, moving all my tunes and you groove it
Stick it, rock it for a click and I'm wicked
Moving, moving all my tunes and you groove it
Now see what I have, I want you
Be with me or stick n' move
Now see what I had, I want you
Be with me or stick n' move
