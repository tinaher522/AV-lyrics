<song artist="Linkin_Park" title="Fuse">
"Of course you know what a fuse is...
It's a long piece of cord impregnated with gun powder.
When you strike a match and light it
It burns, fitfully, spiraling to its end
At which there is, a little surprise..."
From the planet of Krypton
Insuring suit emcees you'll be ripped on (ripped on)
You fell off and it's my lyric sheet you slipped on
Get gone, spit on mic's made in Hong Kong
Rock on, sing songs, we're mightier than King Kong
Or Donkey Kong, you think you want me? Or want this?
You want some? Hold your reputation for ransom
With these here, handsomely crafted tactics
To break a snake emcee like a cheap prophylactic
Galactic, spaced-out gab that grabs attention
Crack-heads nodded like a past can't even mention
Ride on patch traps, gas tracks and sections
Kid's ethnicity, witness protection
Trying to see what I can't be seeing
I'll be here
Trying to see what I can't be seeing
I'll be here
Yo, dig this, dig this
Yo, it's the junkyard crooked letter-C-I-EN-tific
Duck us, the ruckus I'll bring stings your eardrum
Hear one, 'la 'la let loose, find me fearsome
Opposing troops on my home front shall be gone
Testing the eight-hundred-eighteenth battalion
Shall I go on? Crews run like rebels
Enola Gay rhymes kick the notch up a level in intensity
Send back attacks that you sent to me
Blow up your spot with grenades that were meant for me
MP3 verses on R-33 emcees
Swiss cheese your gear putting shrapnel in the breeze
I lead emcees with enemy companies
With my hand full of lyrics, talking 'bout "you want these?"
Please, don't even speak the name of channels
And go low-gadget mic shit, put it down like pens
For my friends and my fam'
Better dodge or I'll ram this mic shot through the back of an emcee's hand
With the strength of He-Man
I'll bet you don't want that
Close-bodies filled fields in hand-to-hand combat
Battle cats, it's like the sectional speech
Warfare words slashin' at cords
Compete for a name, lyrical shots get lit
Don't question my intention when your butt gets kicked
Trying to see what I can't be seeing
I'll be here
(Teflon metallic syllaballic attacks)
Trying to see what I can't be seeing
I'll be here
(We'll haunt MC's with these lyrical back smacks)
(Go ahead, suit yourself)
Why
Why wait, I shouldn't have told you so
Why wait, I shouldn't have told you so
Why wait, I shouldn't have told you so
Why wait, I shouldn't have told you so (Why?)
Why wait, I shouldn't have told you so
Why wait, I shouldn't have told you so
Why wait, I shouldn't have told you so
Why wait, I shouldn't have told you so
Trying to see what I can't be seeing
I'll be here
(Teflon metallic syllaballic attacks)
Trying to see what I can't be seeing
I'll be here
(We'll haunt MC's with these lyrical back smacks)
