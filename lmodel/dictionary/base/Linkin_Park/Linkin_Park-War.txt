<song artist="Linkin_Park" title="War">
One, two, one, two, thank you!
There’s no peace, only war
Victory decides who's wrong or right
It will not cease, only grow
You better be prepared to fight
And it will not apologize
For laying down your life
War
There's no pain it will spare
Fear has become your only right
And once you’re lost in your despair
Forever black eternal night
And it will not apologize
For laying down your life
War
Destroyer
War
Destroyer
It needs no side to justify
Laying down your life
War
Destroyer
War
