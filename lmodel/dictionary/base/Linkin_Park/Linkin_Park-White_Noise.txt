<song artist="Linkin_Park" title="White_Noise">
You've been faking it all this time
You left my trust on the firing line
As the promises break the only mistakes giving you what was mine
Your words are clear but their meaning's gone
The notes are right but the tuning's wrong
And when you tell me again that I should give in
I can only take it so long long long long
You're terrified! Terrified!
You had to throw it all away! All away! All away!
You're terrified! Terrified!
You had to throw it all away!
Fear is dancing inside your eyes
Exposing secrets that you've disguised
And I'm biting my tongue as you've become a victim of a compromise
'Cause I know who you really are
Not a scratch when you pretend you're scarred
And it's time that you see the truth without me
I can only make it so far far far far
You're terrified! Terrified!
You had to throw it all away! All away! All away!
You're terrified! Terrified!
You had to throw it all away!
Throw it all away! All away! Way!
Throw it all away! All away! All away! Way!
Throw it all away! All away! All away! Way!
Throw it all away! All away! All away! Way!
Throw it all away! All aw-
You're terrified! Terrified!
You had to throw it all away! All away! All away!
You're terrified! Terrified!
You had to throw it all away! All away! All away!
You're terrified! Terrified!
You had to throw it all away! All away! All away!
You're terrified! Terrified!
You had to throw it all away!
