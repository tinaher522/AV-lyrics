<song artist="Linkin_Park" title="Lost_In_The_Echo_(KillSonik_Remix)">
In these promises broken, deep below
Each word gets lost in the echo
So one last lie I can see through
This time I've finally let you
Go, go, go
Finally let you go
This time I've finally let you
Test my will, test my heart
Let me tell you how the odds gonna stack up
Y'all go hard, I go smart
How's that working out for y'all in the back, huh?
I've seen that frustration
Been crossed and lost and told no
And I've come back unshaken
Let down and lived and let go
So you can let it be known
I don't hold back, I hold my own
I can't be mapped, I can't be cloned
I can't C-flat, it ain't my tone
I can't fall back, I came too far
Haul myself up and learn my scars
Let the bells ring wherever they are
'Cause I was there saying
In these promises broken, deep below
Each word gets lost in the echo
So one last lie I can see through
This time I've finally let you
Go, go, go
(This time I've)
This time I've
This time I've
This time I've
This time I've
This time I've finally let you go
This time I've finally let you (go)
G-go
Go
G-go
(Promises promises promises promises)
(Promises promises promises promises)
(Promises promises promises promises)
(Promises promises promises promises promises)
In these promises broken (In these promises broken)
Deep below (Deep below)
Each word gets lost in the echo (Each word gets lost in the echo)
So one last lie (So one last lie)
I can see through (I can see through)
This time I've finally let you (This time I've finally let you)
Go, go, go
