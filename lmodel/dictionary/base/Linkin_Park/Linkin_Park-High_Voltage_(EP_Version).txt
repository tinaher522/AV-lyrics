<song artist="Linkin_Park" title="High_Voltage_(EP_Version)">
Just do something to tell you who I am, ya know?
Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh
Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh (Yeah)
Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh (It's high voltage you can't shake the shock)
Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh (Because nobody wants it to stop, check it out)
It's high voltage you can't shake the shock 
Because nobody wants it to stop, check it out 
It's high voltage you can't shake the shock
Because nobody wants it to stop, check it out
It's high voltage you can't shake the shock 
Because nobody wants it to stop, check it out 
It's high voltage you can't shake the shock
Because nobody wants it to stop, check it out
I've been talking into crates ever since I was living in space 
Before the rat-race, before monkeys had human traits (hoo hoo hoo)
Mastered numerology and Big Bang theology 
Performed lobotomies with telekinetic psychology 
Invented the mic so I could start blessin' it 
And chin-checking kids to make my point like an impressionist 
Many men have tried to shake us 
But I twist mic cords to double helixes and show them what I'm made of 
I buckle knees like leg braces 
Cast the spell of intrumental-ness on all of the emcees that hate us 
So try on, leave you without a shoulder to cry on 
From now to infinity let icons be bygones 
I fire-bomb, ghostly notes haunt this 
I've tried threats but moved on to a promise 
I stomp shit with or without an accomplice (Mixed media) 
The stamp of approval that's on this 
It's high voltage you can't shake the shock 
Because nobody wants it to stop, check it out 
It's high voltage you can't shake the shock
Because nobody wants it to stop, check it out
(Akira)
Put a kink in the backbones of clones with microphones 
Never satisfy my rhyme jones 
Spraying bright day over what you might say 
Blood type: Krylon, Technicolor type A 
On highways right with road rage 
On pages of wind and cages of tin that bounce all around 
Surround sound, devouring the scene 
Subliminal gangrene paintings 
Overall the same things 
Sing song karaoke copy madness 
Break bones verbally with sticks and stone tactics 
Fourth dimension, combat convention 
Write rhymes at ease while the tracks stand at attention (Attention)
Meant to put you away with the pencil-pistol, official 16-line rhyme missile 
While you risk your all I pick out of your flaws 
Spittin' "rah blah blah blah"
You can say you saw
It's high voltage you can't shake the shock 
Because nobody wants it to stop, check it out 
It's high voltage you can't shake the shock
Because nobody wants it to stop, check it out
It's high voltage you can't shake the shock 
Because nobody wants it to stop, check it out 
It's high voltage you can't shake the shock
Because nobody wants it to stop, check it out
Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh
Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh
Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh
Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh 
Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh (High voltage)
Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh (High voltage)
Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh (High voltage)
Uh uh uh uh uh (High voltage)
It's high voltage you can't shake the shock 
Because nobody wants it to stop, check it out 
It's high voltage you can't shake the shock
Because nobody wants it to stop, check it out
It's high voltage you can't shake the shock 
Because nobody wants it to stop, check it out 
It's high voltage you can't shake the shock
Because nobody wants it to stop, check it out
