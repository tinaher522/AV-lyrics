<song artist="Linkin_Park" title="Reading_My_Eyes">
The microphone molester, machete undresser
"Stupid-dope-fresh" type shit resurrector
Top gun, Miramar, best-of-the-best-er
The leave-an-emcee-peace-in-rest-er
The skill tester, the flex-the-gunner
The make-funner, the adversary make runner
The make summer cold with rhymes I spit
Kick gift to lifted delinquent wit
I be the prophet, my hand -- top it? Stop it.
Fly like rocket when I rock it
Lock it down with this perverse verse
Every fucking curse a burst of hurt
Move crowds; Physical fitness rhymes
Coke heads couldn't do my lines
I'm decorated like Christmas pines
My battalion rocks
Emcees become silhouettes of chalk
Reading my eyes will say it in many ways
Losing my pride will save it in many days
Hit the dirt because the words I spit
Will do more than just rip your shirt
It'll bitch slap your soul, contact the track control
You're coming at me? You can't hack it though
So ridiculous, watching my crew get sick with this 
Wickedness, pitching this, lyrical viciousness
To crews and cliques, made of men and mistresses
This is my life: the twilight in the fight night
And trying to see nothing but the highlights when I write
These eyes on horizons, die for my song, cry rhymes in Krylon
Fire on, move men telekinetically
Esoterically beat-speaking with clarity
Feel my verities, heroism of heresy
And sever every emcee I see with severity
Reading my eyes will say it in many ways
Losing my pride will save it in many days
Why not... what I came...
Why not... what I came...
Why not... what I came...
Why not give me what I came to deserve?
Why not give me what I came to believe?
Why not give me what I came to deserve?
Why not give me what I came to believe?
Reading my eyes will say it in many ways
Losing my pride will save it in many days
