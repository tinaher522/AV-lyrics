<song artist="Linkin_Park" title="X-Ecutioner_Style">
From the top/From the top/From the top
From the top/From the top/From the top
From the top/From the top
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
Shut up! (When I'm talking to you!)
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
Shut up! I'm about to-
Wasn't that fun, let's try something else...
Forty-five calibre killer, but out of the philla–della–rella
Show y'all brothers how you not a gorilla
Smooth talking, fully automatic weapon concealer
Taste thriller, break thriller
Let's hit 'em with the bounce filler
Filthy stinking, standing on solid ground
And still be sinking, submerging in the parks
Still be linking, plucked beef when it starts
To fuck your thinking, it's not a mirage
I'm in the motherfucking tractor from out the garage
With an if, you can duck, but it's hard to dodge
In the back of the spine where my darts is lodged
Going to flip it straight up/ripping apart your squad
X-Ecutioner style, cuts and blends like a syringe
Hanging you from each of your limbs
See me coming through your party hard without no bodyguard
Smoking something, stomping on each of you Tims
I'm the B–to–the–L, the A, the C, King
And when it comes to planning
The thought to keep thinking, man

Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
Shut up!
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
Shut up!
