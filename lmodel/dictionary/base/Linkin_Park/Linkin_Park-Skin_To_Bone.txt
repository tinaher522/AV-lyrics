<song artist="Linkin_Park" title="Skin_To_Bone">
Skin to bone, steel to rust
Ash to ashes, dust to dust
Will tomorrow have it's way with the promises we made?
Skin to bone, steel to rust
Ash to ashes, dust to dust
Your deception, my disgust
When your name is finally drawn, I’ll be happy that you’re gone
Ash to ashes, dust to dust
Uh-uh-uh
Ash to ashes, dust to dust
Uh-uh-uh
Skin to bone and steel to rust
Right to left, left to right
Night to day and day to night
As the starlight fades to grey, I’ll be marching far away
Right to left and left to right
Uh-uh-uh
Ash to ashes, dust to dust
Uh-uh-uh
Skin to bone and steel to rust
Let tomorrow have it's ways with the promises betrayed
Skin to bone and steel to rust
Skin to bone and steel to rust
Skin to bone and steel to rust
