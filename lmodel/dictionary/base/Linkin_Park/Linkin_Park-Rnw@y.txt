<song artist="Linkin_Park" title="Rnw@y">
Graffiti skies, skies...(echo fade)
I don't think ya'll ready
Yo, I don't think ya'll ready
Graffiti decorations under a sky of gray
This constant apprehension still giving me away
The lessons I've forgotten
In spite of all I've learned
Now I find myself in question
(Point, point the finger at me again)
Guilty by association
(Point, point the finger at me again)
I wanna runaway
(I wanna runaway)
I wanna know the truth
(I wanna know the truth)
I wanna know the answers
(I wanna know the answers)
I wanna shut the door
(And open up my mind)
And open up my mind
(And open up my mind)
Paper bags and angry voices under a sky of gray
This constant apprehension won't seem to go away
All my talk of starting over
These words were never true
Now I find myself in question
(Point, point the finger at me again)
I'm guilty by association
(Point, point the finger at me again)
I wanna runaway
(I wanna runaway)
I wanna know the truth
(I wanna know the truth)
I wanna know the answers
(I wanna know the answers)
I wanna shut the door
(And open up my mind)
And open up my mind
(And open up my mind)
Gonna runaway, gonna runaway
Gonna runaway, gonna runaway
Runaway (being scratched over and over again)
(Ya'll not ready)
Hey yo
I don't think ya'll ready for what I'm about to do
Y'all new school dudes ain't even got no clue
How dare you forget about Bam and Zulu
Two urban jazz DJ's they paved the way
Let me spit it to y'all who said I wasn't gonna make it
Every time I blaze it, ya'll the first to hate it
My team reins supreme and stays strong
Every 2 series son, they scared to put us on
Can't get with the high prince, get off your high atis
Too many of y'all is dyin' for us so I gotta blaze it
I'm still reppin BK, Brooklyn D and on
Hell fire and family alienation
Banging hits in the backyard
Out on the episode
I'm a little kid named
Phoenix Orion
I wanna runaway
(I wanna runaway)
I wanna know the truth
(I wanna know the truth)
I wanna know the answers
(I wanna know the answers)
I wanna shut the door
(And open up my mind)
And open up my mind
(And open up my mind)
