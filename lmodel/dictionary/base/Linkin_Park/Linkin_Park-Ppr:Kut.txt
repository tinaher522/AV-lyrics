Uh, yeah 
Why does it feel like night today?
Something in here's not right today
Why am I so uptight today?
Paranoia's all I got left
I don't know what stressed me first
Or how the pressure was fed
But I know just what it feels like
To have a voice in the back of my head
Like a face that I hold inside
Face that awakes when I close my eyes
Face that I watch every time I lie
Face that laughs every time I fall
And watches everything
So I know that when it's time to sink or swim
That the face inside is hearing me
Right underneath my skin
It's like I'm paranoid looking over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin
Hey yo
Here we go again with the pain I feel
Is it real or in my mind
When I found myself in places
With names but not faces
My memory races at speeds
Hundred degrees, my soul bleed
Devil must of planted the seed
Now it feels like my back's against the wall
I'm taking the fall
Whenever I call
Nobody's responding at all
But I don't know who I can trust
They screaming my name
I need somebody
To help me out of the flame
All I'm trying to do is just master me
All I wanna do is smoke a blast a beat
But something keeps talking to me consciously
Responsibly, keeps haunting me
From dusk till dawn
Everything has something for ya
That voice inside of your head
Got to project it
Paranoia, cold sweat
Shining on your face
Exposing your purpose
And if I ripped off your skin
I'd probably find another person
There's nothing worse
Than trying to pull yourself up
Back from the dead
So I advise you
Listen to that voice in the back of your head
It's like I'm paranoid looking over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin
It's like I'm paranoid looking over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin
The face inside is right beneath the skin (x4)
The sun goes down
I feel the light betray me
The sun goes down
It's like I'm paranoid
I feel the light betray me
The sun...
Can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin
It's like I'm paranoid looking over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin
It's like I'm paranoid looking over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin
