God bless us, everyone
We're a broken people living under loaded gun
And it can't be outfought, it can't be outdone
It can't be outmatched, it can't be outrun, no
God bless us, everyone
We're a broken people living under loaded gun
And it can't be outfought, it can't be outdone
It can't be outmatched, it can't be outrun, no
And when I close my eyes tonight
To symphonies of blinding light
(God bless us, everyone)
(We're a broken people living under loaded gun)
Oh, like memories in cold decay
Transmissions echoing away
Far from the world of you and I
Where oceans bleed into the sky
God save us, everyone
Will we burn inside the fires of a thousand suns?
For the sins of our hand, the sins of our tongue
The sins of our father, the sins of our young, no
God save us, everyone
Will we burn inside the fires of a thousand suns?
For the sins of our hand, the sins of our tongue
The sins of our father, the sins of our young, no
And when I close my eyes tonight
To symphonies of blinding light
(God save us, everyone)
(Will we burn inside the fires of a thousand suns?)
Oh, like memories in cold decay
Transmissions echoing away
Far from the world of you and I
Where oceans bleed into the sky
Oh, like memories in cold decay
Transmissions echoing away
Far from the world of you and I
Where oceans bleed into the sky
Lift me up, let me go
Lift me up, let me go
Lift me up, let me go
Lift me up, let me go
Lift me up, let me go
Lift me up, let me go
Lift me up, let me go
Lift me up, let me go
God bless us, everyone (Lift me up)
We're a broken people living under loaded gun (Let me go)
And, it can't be outfought (Lift me up)
It can't be outdone, it can't be outmatched (Let me go)
It can't be outrun, no
God bless us, everyone
We're a broken people living under loaded gun
And, it can't be outfought
It can't be outdone, it can't be outmatched
It can't be outrun, no
God bless us, everyone (Lift me up)
We're a broken people living under loaded gun (Let me go)
And, it can't be outfought (Lift me up)
It can't be outdone, it can't be outmatched (Let me go)
It can't be outrun
