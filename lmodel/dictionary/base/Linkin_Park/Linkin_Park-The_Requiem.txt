<song artist="Linkin_Park" title="The_Requiem">
"God save us, everyone
Will we burn inside the fires of a thousand suns
For the sins of our hand, sins of our tongue
The sins of our father, the sins of our young?"
"God save us, everyone
Will we burn inside the fires of a thousand suns
For the sins of our hand, sins of our tongue
The sins of our father, the sins of our young?"
