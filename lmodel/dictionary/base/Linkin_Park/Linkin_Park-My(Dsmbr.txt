This is My December,
This is my time of the year...
This is My December,
This is all so clear...
(Just wish that I didn't feel 
Like there was something I missed...) (x2)
This is My December,
This is my snow-covered home...
This is My December,
This is me alone...
And I...
(Just wish that I didn't feel
Like there was something I missed...)
And I...
(Take back all the things I said
To make you feel like that...)
And I...
(Just wish that I didn't feel
Like there was something I missed...)
And I...
(Take back the things I ever said to you...)
And I'd,
Give it all away...
Just to have somewhere to go to
Give it all away...
To have someone to come home to...
This is My December,
These are my snow-covered trees...
This is me pretending,
This is all I need...
And I...
(Just wish that I didn't feel
Like there was something I missed...)
And I...
(Take back all the things I said
To make you feel like that...)
And I...
(Just wish that I didn't feel
Like there was something I missed...)
And I...
(Take back the things I ever said to you...)
And I'd,
Give it all away...
Just to have somewhere to go to
Give it all away...
To have someone to come home to...
This is My December...
This is my time of the year...
This is My December...
This is all so clear!...
Give it all away...
Just to have somewhere to go to
Give it all away...
To have someone to come home to...
Give it all away...
Just to have somewhere to go to
Give it all away...
To have someone to come home to...
