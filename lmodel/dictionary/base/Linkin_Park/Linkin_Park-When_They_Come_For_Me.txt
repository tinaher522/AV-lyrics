<song artist="Linkin_Park" title="When_They_Come_For_Me">
Yeah
I am not a pattern to be followed
The pill that I'm on is a tough one to swallow
I'm not a criminal, not a role model
Not a born leader; I'm a tough act to follow
I am not the fortune and the fame
Or the same person telling you to forfeit the game
I came in the ring like a dog on a chain
And I found out the underbelly's sicker than it seems
And it seems ugly, but it can get worse
'Cause even the blueprint is a gift and a curse
'Cause once you got the theory of how the thing works
Everybody wants the next thing to be just like the first
And I'm not a robot, I'm not a monkey
I will not dance even if the beat's funky
Opposite of lazy, far from a punk 
Y'all ought to stop talking, start trying to catch up, motherfucker
And all the people say
Try to catch up motherfucker
Lauryn said money change a situation
Big said it increase the complication
Kane said don't step, I ain't the one
Chuck said that Uzi weigh a motherfucking ton
And I'm just a student of the game that they taught me
Rocking every stage and every place that it brought me
I'm awfully underrated, but came here to correct it
And so it ain't mistaken, I'mma state it for the record
I am the opposite of whack; opposite of weak
Opposite of slack; synonym of heat; synonym of crack 
Closest to a peak, far from a punk
Y'all ought to stop talking, start trying to catch up, motherfucker
And all the people say
Try to catch up motherfucker
Oh, when they come for me
Come for me, I'll be gone
Oh, when they come for me
Come for me, I'll be gone
Oh, when they come for me
Come for me, I'll be gone
And all the people say
Try to catch up motherfucker
And all the people say
Try to catch up motherfucker
