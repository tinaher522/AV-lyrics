<song artist="Linkin_Park" title="Powerless_(Enferno_Remix)">
And you held it all
But you were careless to let it fall
You held it all
And I was by your side
Powerless
Powerless
Powerless
Powerless
Powerless
And you held it all
But you were careless to let it fall
You held it all
And I was by your side
Powerless
Powerless
Powerless
Powerless
Powerless
Powerless
Powerless
Powerless
