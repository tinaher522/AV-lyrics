<song artist="Linkin_Park" title="In_My_Remains">
Separate
Sifting through the wreckage, I can't concentrate
Searching for a message in the fear and pain
Broken down and waiting for the chance to feel alive
Now in my remains are promises that never came
Set this silence free to wash away the worst of me
Come apart
Falling in the cracks of every broken heart
Digging through the wreckage of your disregard
Sinking down and waiting for a chance to feel alive
Now in my remains are promises that never came
Set this silence free to wash away the worst of me
Like an army, falling one by one by one
Like an army, falling one by one by one
Like an army, falling one by one by one
Like an army, falling one by one by one
Now in my remains are promises that never came
Set this silence free to wash away the worst of me
Like an army, falling one by one by one
Like an army, falling one by one by one
