<song artist="The_Beatles" title=""First_Of_All...It_Didn't_Do_A_Thing_Here"">
First of all we made a recording with a fella called Tony Sheridan. We were working in a club called the Top Ten club in Hamburg and we made a recording with him called My Bonnie which got to number five in the German hit parade, but, it never, it didn't do a thing over here.
