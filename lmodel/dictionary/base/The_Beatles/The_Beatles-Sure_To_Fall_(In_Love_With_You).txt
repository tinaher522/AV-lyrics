<song artist="The_Beatles" title="Sure_To_Fall_(In_Love_With_You)">
I'm sure to fall, fall in love, 
I'm sure to fall in love with you. 
You are so sweet and so near. 
I'm sure to fall in love with you. 
So hold me tight, 
And let tonight be the night. 
Darling, don't ever let me go. 
Loving you is the natural thing to do, 
I want you for the rest of my life. 
So hold me tight, 
Let tonight be the night. 
Oh darling, don't ever let me go. 
Loving you is the natural thing to do, 
I want you for the rest of my life.
