<song artist="The_Beatles" title="Riding_On_A_Bus_(Speech)">
Brian Matthew: Before we hear another song, fellows, there is a few things I'd like to ask you. First of all, do you ever get tired of being Beatles?
Paul: We don't think so, really.
Brian: You don't ever think that?
Paul: Just occasionally, you get cheesed off with people writing rubbish about you, which you get often.
John: Yeah, I agree with that. I've had a divorce and half a dozen kids.
Brian: Now, what do you, uh, well, I mean, doesn't, isn't this a big sort of drag to go around explaining to your wife that you're not divorced and all that sort of things?
John: No, she knows I'm not divorced, 'cause I keep seeing her every day, you see.
Brian: Yes, a point, but what about the simpler things of life, like, uh--
Paul: Like riding on a bus?
Brian: Yeah, or going to just about any restaurant you--
Paul: Well, yeah, you miss those sort of things.
John: We go to certain ones.
George: And we go to ones where the people there are so snobby, they're the type who pretend they don't know us, so we have a good time, 'cause they pretend they don't know us.
Paul: Joe's CafAc!
Brian: Yeah, that figures.
Paul: Joe's CafAc! Social comment, that, you know.
George: It is.
