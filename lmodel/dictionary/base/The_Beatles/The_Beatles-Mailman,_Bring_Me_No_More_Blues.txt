<song artist="The_Beatles" title="Mailman,_Bring_Me_No_More_Blues">
She wrote me only one sad night, 
told me she's no longer mine. 
Sue sue mailman, that will do for sometime. 
Mailman, bring me no more blues. 
Mailman, bring me no more blues. 
One more heartache is all I can use. 
Mailman, bring me no more blues. 
Mailman, bring me no more blues...
