<song artist="The_Beatles" title="She_Loves_You">
She loved you, yeah, yeah, yeah
She loved you, yeah, yeah, yeah
She loved you, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You think you've lost your love
Well, I saw her yesterday
It's you she's thinking of
And she told me what to say
She said she loves you
And you know that can't be bad
Yes, she loves you
And you know you should be glad
She said you hurt her so
She almost lost her mind
But now she says she knows
You're not the hurting kind
She said she loves you
And you know that can't be bad
Yes, she loves you
And you know you should be glad
Ooh
She loved you, yeah, yeah, yeah
She loved you, yeah, yeah, yeah
And with a love like that
You know you should be glad
You know it's up to you
I think it's only fair
Pride can hurt you too
Apologize to her
Because she loves you
And you know that can't be bad
She loves you
And you know you should be glad
Ooh
She loved you, yeah, yeah, yeah
She loved you, yeah, yeah, yeah
With a love like that
You know you should be glad
With a love like that
You know you should be glad
With a love like that
You know you should be glad
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
