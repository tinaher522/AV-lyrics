<song artist="The_Beatles" title="Hallelujah,_I_Love_Her_So">
Let me tell you about a girl I know, 
She's my baby and I love her so. 
Every morning when the sun comes up, 
She brings me coffee in my favorite cup. 
That's why I know, yes I know, 
Hallelujah I just love her so. 
When I call her on the telephone, 
She says: baby, I'm all alone. 
By the time I count from one to four, 
She'll be knocking on my door. 
In the evening when the sun goes down 
And there ain't nobody else around, 
She kisses me and she holds me tight. 
She says: baby everything is alright. 
That's why I know, that's why I know 
Hallelujah I just love her so. 
Hallelujah I just love her so, 
Hallelujah I just love that chick so
