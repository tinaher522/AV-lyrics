<song artist="The_Beatles" title="Eight_Days_A_Week_(False_Starts)">
John: Okay, is it just me and you?
Paul: Yeah.
John: One two three four.
Oh I need your love babe
guess you know it's true
hope you need my love babe
just like I need you.
Hold me love me
hold me love me
I ain't got nothin' but love babe
eight days a week.
Love you every day girl
always on my mind.
John: Er..snotty!
Paul: Can I play that by myself? It might be better.
John: Remember the other two verses.
Paul: I'll try to remember, John and if I don't, well, it's just too bad, isn't it?
