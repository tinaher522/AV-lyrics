<song artist="The_Beatles" title="Mother_Nature's_Son">
Born a poor young country boy
Mother Nature's son
All day long I'm sitting
Singing songs for everyone
Sit beside a mountain stream
See her waters rise
Listen to the pretty
Sound of music as she flies
Doo-doo doo doo doo doo
Doo-oo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo
Doo-oo doo doo doo
Ndoo doo-doo
Find me in my field of grass
Mother Nature's son
Swaying daisies sing
A lazy song beneath the Sun
Doo-doo doo doo doo doo
Doo-oo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo
Doo-oo doo doo doo
Doo doo-doo doo-oo doo-doo
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Mm, Mother Nature's son
