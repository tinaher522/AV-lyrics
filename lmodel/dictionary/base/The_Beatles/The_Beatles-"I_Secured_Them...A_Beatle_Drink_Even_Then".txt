<song artist="The_Beatles" title=""I_Secured_Them...A_Beatle_Drink_Even_Then"">
I secured them an audition at Decca on New Year's Day, 1962. They came to London and stayed at the Royal Hotel paying 27 shillings a night for bed and breakfast. They were poor and I wan't rich but we all celebrated with Rum, Scotch and Coke which was becoming a Beatle drink even then.
