<song artist="The_Beatles" title=""Sometimes_I'd_Borrow...Those_Still_Exists"">
"Sometimes I'd borrow a tape recorder, a Grundig with a little green eye and we'd sort of go around to my house and tried to record little things such as... I remember Hallelujah, I Just Love Her So 'cause I had the Eddie Cochran record. But those were very much home demos, very bad quality. I think a couple of those still exist."
