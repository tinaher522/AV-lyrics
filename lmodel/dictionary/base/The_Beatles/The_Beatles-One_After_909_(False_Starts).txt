<song artist="The_Beatles" title="One_After_909_(False_Starts)">
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby don't be cold as ice
She said I'm travellin' on the one after 909.
Picked up my bags run to the station
Railman said you got the wrong location
picked up my bags run right home...
John: What are you doing?
Paul: Ah, it's murder! I can't do it, can't keep it up, I'm just goin'.
George: Use your plec!
Paul: I haven't got one! Use the plec. I've been tryin' to get them all day.
John: Well, your clothes have been brought hours ago.
Paul: I know but the case was hardly moved.
John: I said to you before, Paul, don't forget your plec with your clothes in.
Paul: I know but the cases are still up at the door.
Neil Aspinal: I said do you want me to bring your case in &amp; you just walked away!
Paul: I didn't think, I thought you said I didn't really want.
Control room: Here we go!
Paul: George?
...you got the number wrong
Well I said I'm travellin' on the one after 909
Move over honey I'm travellin' on that line
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby don't be cold as ice
She said I'm travellin' on the one after 909.
Well my baby says she's travellin' on the one af...
John: Oh hell! I told you!
Paul: You see, it's you! It's you!
John: You said we'd miss out a bit late.
Ringo: Your comin' in durin' the solo.
Paul: Your comin' in wrong, halfway through the solo!
John: Oh! What? Was it a 12 bar.
George Martin: Yeah yeah, 4 bars, once again.
Paul: 2 3 1 2 3 4!
Said she's travellin' on the one after 909...
