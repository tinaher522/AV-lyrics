<song artist="Onerepublic" title="Too_Easy">
Autumn wind turns again
And the days of warmth start to fade
And all that's here is still the same
And memories fall like rain
And the only world I know
Steady as you go
It's too easy, it's too easy for you
It's too easy, it's too easy for you
Sinking in the sands of time
I'm miserable but I'll be fine
I'll burn a fire above the earth
So Heaven's on my side
Hell is here tonight
No more alibis
It's too easy, it's too easy for you
It's too easy, it's too easy for you
Autumn wind turns again
And days are warm, start to fade
