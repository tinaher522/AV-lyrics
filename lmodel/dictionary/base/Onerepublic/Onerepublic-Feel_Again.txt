<song artist="Onerepublic" title="Feel_Again">
It's been a long time comin' since I seen your face
I've been everywhere and back tryin' to replace 
Everything that I had til my feet went numb
Praying like a fool that's been on the run
Heart still beating but it's not working
It's like a million dollar phone that you just can't ring
I reached out tried to love but I feel nothing
Yeah, my heart is numb
But with you
I feel again
Yeah with you
I can feel again
Yeah
(Woo-hoo-hoo-hooo-hoo-hoo Woo-hoo-hoo-hooo-hoo-hoo
Woo-hoo-hoo-hooo-hoo-hoo Woo-hoo-hoo-hooo-hoo-hoo)
I'm feeling better ever since you know me
(Woo-hoo-hoo-hooo-hoo-hoo Woo-hoo-hoo-hooo-hoo-hoo)
I was a lonely soul but that's the old me
(Woo-hoo-hoo-hooo-hoo-hoo Woo-hoo-hoo-hooo-hoo-hoo)

It's been a long time coming since I've seen your face
And I've never went back trying to replace 
Everything that I broke till my feet went numb
Praying like a fool just shy of a gun
Heart still beating but it's not working
It's like a hundred thousand voices that just can't sing
I reach out trying to love but I feel nothing
Oh my heart is numb
But with you
I feel again
Yeah with you
I can feel again
But with you
(I'm feeling better ever since you know me)
I feel again
(I was a lonely soul but that's the old me)
Yeah with you
(I'm feeling better ever since you know me)
I can feel again
(I was a lonely soul)
Woo-hooo
(Woo-hoo-hoo-hooo-hoo-hoo Woo-hoo-hoo-hooo-hoo-hoo
Woo-hoo-hoo-hooo-hoo-hoo Woo-hoo-hoo-hooo-hoo-hoo)
(I'm feeling better ever since you know me)
(Woo-hoo-hoo-hooo-hoo-hoo Woo-hoo-hoo-hooo-hoo-hoo)
(I was a lonely soul, but that's the old me)
(Woo-hoo-hoo-hooo-hoo-hoo Woo-hoo-hoo-hooo-hoo-hoo)
I'm feeling better ever since you know me
(Woo-hoo-hoo-hooo-hoo-hoo Woo-hoo-hoo-hooo-hoo-hoo)
I was a lonely soul, but that's the old me
(Woo-hoo-hoo-hooo-hoo-hoo Woo-hoo-hoo-hooo-hoo-hoo)
I'm feeling better ever since you know me
(Woo-hoo-hoo-hooo-hoo-hoo Woo-hoo-hoo-hooo-hoo-hoo)
I was a lonely soul, but that's the old me
(Woo-hoo-hoo-hooo-hoo-hoo Woo-hoo-hoo-hooo-hoo-hoo)
I'm feeling better ever since you know me
I was a lonely soul but that's the old me
A little wiser now from what you showed me
Yeah, I feel again
Feel again
Woo-hoo-hoo-hooo-hoo-hoo
