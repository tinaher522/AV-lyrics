<song artist="Onerepublic" title="Goodbye,_Apathy">
I can't sleep, no, not like I used to
I can't breathe in and out like I need to
It's breaking ice, now, to make any movement
What's your vice? You know that mine's the illusion
And all at once (as I'm trying)
I can help you out (just to keep things right)
I'll be what you need
(I kill myself to make everything perfect for you)
I'll do anything
Goodbye, apathy
So long, apathy
So don't sit still, but don't you move away from here
So goodbye, apathy (as I'm trying)
So long, fancy free (just to keep things right)
Goodbye, apathy
(I kill myself to make everything perfect for you)
I don't wanna be you
I don't walk right, not like I used to
There's a jump in my step as I rush to see you
I could be happy here as long as you're near to me
As long as you're close to me
Now that I'm alright (as I'm trying)
I can help you out (just to keep things right)
I'll be what you need
(I kill myself to make everything perfect for you)
Goodbye, apathy
So goodbye, apathy
So don't you stop pushing me, I can take so much
So goodbye, apathy (as I'm trying)
So long, fancy free (just to keep things right)
Goodbye, apathy
(I kill myself to make everything perfect for you)
I don't wanna be you
Everybody is watching you, everybody is watching me, too
Everybody is watching you, everybody is watching me, too
(I can't sleep, no, not like I used to)
Everybody is watching you, everybody is watching me, too
Everybody is watching you, everybody is watching me, too
(I can't breathe in and out like I need to)
(It's breaking ice, now, to make any movement)
Everybody is watching you, everybody is watching me, too
(What's your vice? You know that mine's the illusion)
Everybody is watching you, everybody is watching me, too
