<song artist="Onerepublic" title="Prodigal">
We say "goodbye", I turn my back
Run away, run away, so predictable
Not far from here, you see me crack
Like a bone, like a bone, I'm so breakable
I take everything from you
But you'll take anything, won't you?
Run away, run away, like a prodigal
Don't you wait for me, don't you wait for me
So ashamed, so ashamed, but I need you so
And you wait for me, and you wait for me
I'm on the road to who knows where
Look ahead, not behind, I keep sayin'
There's no place to go where you're not there
On your rope, I hold tight, but it's frayin'
And I take everything from you
But you'll take anything, won't you?
Run away, run away, like a prodigal
Don't you wait for me, don't you wait for me
So ashamed, so ashamed, but I need you so
And you wait for me, and you wait for me, yeah
Everybody wants to be right, but only if it's night or daylight
And I keep tryin' to find my way back, my way back
Run away, run away, like a prodigal
Don't you wait for me, don't you wait for me
So ashamed, so ashamed, but I need you so
And you wait for me, and you wait for me, yeah
Run away, run away, away from you, from you, from you, oh
