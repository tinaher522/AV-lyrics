<song artist="Onerepublic" title="Tyrant">
Watchin' myself and I'm taking strides
But here comes the moon
And it feels, and it feels, like an informer
Quick, runaway, hide, before they see you
You know it is all, all aglow
Walking on water seems perilous now
You've got my trust, and it feels, and it feels
Like sabotage, but I'm pulling triggers back on myself
And you know it is all
All I know, (it's) all I know
And it feels so real from the outside looking in
Yeah, it feels so real from the outside
From the out, from the out
Tyrant, tyrant
Capable of 'most anything
This crippled bird's gonna sing, gonna bring you
All the answers, quick, turn around, look
Your shadow's cookin' up beautiful
Lies for you, that's what they do
And it feels so real from the outside looking in
And it feels so real from the outside
From the out, from the out, from the out, from the out Tyrant, oh
I'm stained with apathy, I'm blind but I can see
A tyrant to the bones, yeah
I'm stained with apathy, I'm blind, but I can see, oh
Don't justify me, don't justify me (yeah), don't justify me, yeah
Oh, don't justify me, justify, justify me
From the out, from the out, from the out
From the out, from the out, from the out
And it feels so real from the outside looking in
