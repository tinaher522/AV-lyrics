<song artist="Onerepublic" title="Made_For_You">
(One and two and three and four
and one and two and three and four)
(One and two and three and four
and one and two and three and four)
I was writing, thinking with my long hand
Put pen to paper, everything was sinking in
Start to wonder how you’re gonna handle me
When I’m under, swimming in the darkest sea
Everybody wants you to make it, it’s all yours (uh huh)
Everybody wants you to take it, it’s all yours (uh huh)
Everybody wants you to make it, it’s all yours (uh huh)
Everybody wants you to take it, t-t-take it
Can you feel all the love?
Can you feel all the love?
And you feel all the love
Can you feel all the love like it was made for you?
Like it was made for you
Like it was made for you
It was made for you
Tell me something, something that can move me
Don't tell me lies or I swear you’re gonna lose me
Getting like an ocean jealous of the fish
It feeds your devotion, swimming inside of me
Can you feel all the love?
(Everybody wants you to make it, it’s all yours)
Can you feel all the love?
(Everybody wants you to take it, it’s all yours)
And you feel all the love?
(Everybody wants you to make it, it’s all yours)
Can you feel all the love?
(Everybody wants you to take it)
Like it was made for you
Like it was made for you
Like it was made for you
It was made for you
Can you feel
Can you feel
Can you feel
All the right friends in all the right places
All the right moves and all the right faces
All the right friends in all the right places
All the right moves and all the right faces
(Can you feel all the love)
All the right friends in all the right places
(Can you feel all the love)
All the right moves and all the right faces
(Feel all the love)
All the right friends in all the right places
(Can you feel all the love)
All the right moves and all the right faces
(Talking)
All the right friends in all the right places
All the right moves and all the right faces
Ooh oh, we’re going down
