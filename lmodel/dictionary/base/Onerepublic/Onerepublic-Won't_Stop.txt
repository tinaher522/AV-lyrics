<song artist="Onerepublic" title="Won't_Stop">
Now, I stared at you from across the room
Until both my eyes were faded
I was in a rush, I was out of luck
Now I'm so glad I waited
Well, you were almost there, almost mine, yeah
They say love ain't fair, but I'm doing fine
'Cause I swear it's you, I swear it's you
(I swear it's you)
I swear it's you that I've waited for
And I swear it's you, I swear it's you
(I swear it's you)
I swear it's you that my heart beats for
And it ain't gonna stop, no, it just won't stop
Now, you are fire by night
But when the morning light comes
Comfortable as rain on Sunday
And I'm the lucky soul that holds your hand
So tight, hope you hear this one day
Don't fool yourself
This is my truth
I swear it's you, I swear it's you
(I swear it's you)
I swear it's you that I've waited for
And I swear it's you, I swear it's you
(I swear it's you)
I swear it's you that my heart beats for
And it ain't gonna stop, just won't stop
You take this hand
You take this heart
Stir my bones from a thousand miles apart
It feels so cold
Without you, like it's ten shades of winter
And I need the sun
And I swear it's you, I swear it's you
I swear it's you I waited for
I swear it's you, I swear it's you
I swear it's you that my heart beats for
I swear it's you, I swear it's you
(I swear it's you)
I swear it's you that I've waited for
(That I've waited for)
I swear it's you, I swear it's you
I swear it's you that my heart beats for
And it ain't gonna stop, just won't stop, hey
Just won't stop, just won't stop, no
I swear it's you, I swear it's you
