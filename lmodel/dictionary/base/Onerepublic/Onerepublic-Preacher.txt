<song artist="Onerepublic" title="Preacher">
When I was a kid
I used to buy and sell gravity
I knew how to fly
And I would teach you for a fee
Broke every window
In my hotel heart
When I was only 5 years old the 12 years scarred
And I'd hear the same voice 
Echo in my mind
Said 'son you got an angel,
To chase the devil at the light'
Yeah, When I was a kid
My grandfather was a preacher
He'd talk about God
Like he was something like a teacher
He said 'God only helps those
Who learn to help themselves'
He was a million miles from a million dollars
But you could never spend his wealth
I took a little faith
And put it in a parking lot
I drove to a strange town
Full of have and have nots
And as I walked through that storybook of life
I was looking for an angel to chase the devil at the light
Oh! oh! oh!
When I was a kid
My grandfather was a preacher
He'd talk about love
Yeah he was something like a teacher
He said 'God only helps those
Who learn to help themselves'
He was a million miles from a million dollars
But you could never spend his wealth
Oh! oh! oh!
Wave, Put your hands up and hands down 
Wave, Put your hands up and hands down 
Wave, Put your hands up and hands down 
When I was a kid
My grandfather was a preacher
He'd talk about life
Yeah he was something like a teacher
He said 'God only helps those
Who learn to help themselves'
He was a million miles from a million dollars
But you could never spend his wealth
He was a million miles from a million dollars
But you could never spend his wealth
