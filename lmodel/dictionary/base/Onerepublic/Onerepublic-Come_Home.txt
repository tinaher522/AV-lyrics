<song artist="Onerepublic" title="Come_Home">
Hello, world, hope you're listening
Forgive me if I'm young or speaking out of turn
But there's someone that I've been missin'
And I think that they could be the better half of me
They're in the wrong place, tryin' to make it right
And I'm tired of justifying, so I say to you
"Come home, come home
'Cause I've been waitin' for ya, for so long, for so long
And right now there's a war between the vanities
But all I see is you and me
And the fight for you is all I've ever known
So come home"
I get lost in the beauty
Of everything I see, the world ain't half as bad as they paint it to be
If all the sons, all the daughters, stop to take it in
Hopefully, the hate subsides, and the love can begin
It might start now, or maybe I'm just dreamin' out loud, but until then
"Come home, come home
'Cause I've been waitin' for ya for so long, for so long
And right now there's a war between the vanities
But all I see is you and me
And the fight for you is all I've ever known (ever known)
So come home"
Everything I can't be, is everything you should be
And that's why I need you here
Everything I can't be, is everything you should be
And that's why I need you here
So hear this now
"Come home, come home
'Cause I've been waitin' for ya for so long, for so long
And right now there's a war between the vanities
But all I see is you and me
And the fight for you is all I've ever known (ever known)
So come home
Come home"
