<song artist="Onerepublic" title="Waking_Up">
I found verity on N'Orleans Avenue
Down where the air is thick as L.A. skies are blue
The water tried to break it down but it held through...
It gave a little for the sake of staying true
We cut ties, we tell lies
We hate change and we wanna claim where we feel
We take tolls, we rake coals
Yeah we dig holes and we’ll dig ‘em right in your fields
We’re waking up, we’re waking up
And right on time, and right on time
We’ll take these roads, we’ll break them up
And right on time, and right on time
We got cause, we write laws
We won’t pause
Don’t you know we’re all wizards welcome to Oz
We don’t lose, we might bruise
Yeah we will rain fire on you ‘til you’re praying to all of your gods
We’re waking up, we’re waking up
And right on time, and right on time
We’ll take these roads, we’ll break them up
And right on time, and right on time
On time
Right on time
Waking up, waking up
Yeah ooh oh ooh
