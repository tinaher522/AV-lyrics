<song artist="Onerepublic" title="Something_I_Need">
I had a dream the other night
About how we only get one life
Woke me up right after two
Stayed awake and stared at you
So I wouldn't lose my mind
And I had the week that came from Hell
And yes I know that you can tell
But you're like the net under the ledge
But I go flying of the edge
You go flying off as well
And if you only die once I wanna die with
You got something I need
In this world full of people there's one killing me
And if we only die once I wanna die with you (you, you, you)
You got something I need
In this world full of people there's one killing me
And if we only die once I wanna die with you (you, you, you)
Last night I think I drank too much
Call it our temporary crutch
With broken words I tried to say
Honey don't you be afraid
If we got nothing we got us (Yeah)
And if you only die once I wanna die with
You got something I need
In this world full of people there's one killing me
And if we only die once I wanna die with you (you, you, you)
You got something I need
In this world full of people there's one killing me
And if we only die once I wanna die with you (you, you, you)
I know that we're not the same
But I'm so damn glad that we made it
To this time, this time, now
You got something I need
Yeah in this world full of people there's one killing me
And if we only die once I wanna die with you (Yeah)
You got something I need
In this world full of people there's one killing me
And if we only die once I wanna die with you (you, you, you)
You got something I need
In this world full of people there's one killing me
And if we only die once I wanna die with you (you, you, you)
If we only die once I wanna die with
If we only live once I wanna live with you
