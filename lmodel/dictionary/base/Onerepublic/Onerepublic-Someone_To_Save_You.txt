<song artist="Onerepublic" title="Someone_To_Save_You">
Patience, it took you for everything
It looked like a diamond ring
And you wore it so much longer than made sense
Apathy, in disguise, crept on you like a spy
And hurt you in ways you can't describe
Back to the start now
I won't let you go this way now
Honesty is what you need, it sets you free
Like someone to save you
Let it go, but hurry, though, there's undertow
And I don't wanna lose you now
Alright, sit down and spill your heart
Let's start from the very start
'Cause I can see by your eyes you're wasted
Your energy comes and goes
You've taken your time, and know
Nothin' can change what's happened, so
Back to the start now
I won't let you go this way out
Honesty is what you need, it sets you free
Like someone to save you
Let it go, but hurry though, there's undertow
And I don't wanna lose (don't want to lose you) now, now
Don't wanna lose you now
Oh my, look how your bright star's faded so
How much can you take?
Honesty is what you need, it sets you free
Like someone to save you
Let it go, but hurry though, there's undertow
And I don't wanna lose you now
Na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na
Someone to save you
Na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na
Someone to save you
Na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na
Someone to save you
Na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na
Save you
Na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na
Save you
Someone to save you
Na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na
What you need is
Someone to save you
