<song artist="Onerepublic" title="Can't_Stop">
I guess this is what it's supposed to feel like
No we don't talk, no we don't talk, we don't talk anymore.
I guess this is what it's supposed to sound like
The universe, the universe, universe is torn.
I don't want to live without you
I can live without you half the day, heeeay hey
I don't want to live without you
And put life off for another day
Hey-hey yeah hey-hey yeeeah 
But I can't stop
Thinking about.. thinking about us
Anymore oooh oh
I said I can't stop 
Thinking about.. thinking about us
Anymore ooh oh
I said I can't stop.. no
Thinking about.. thinking about this
Anymore ooh oh
And all I've got.. uuuh
Is nothing I want
Anymore ooh oh
No I never get used to silence
But I don't hear, no I don't hear
I don't hear you anymore.
I know I had to look hard to find it
Everything, everything,
Everything is gone.
I don't want to live without you
And put life off for another day
hey-hey yeah hey-hey yeeeah 
But I can't stop
Thinking about.. thinking about us
Anymore oooh oh
I said I can't stop 
Thinking about.. thinking about us
Anymore ooh oh
I said I can't stop.. no
Thinking about.. thinking about this
Anymore ooh oh
And all I've got.. uuuh
Is nothing I want
Anymore ooh oh
I can see stars, I can see our lives in a self destructing lane,
I can see stars, I can see lights... shining here.
But I can't stop
Thinking about.. thinking about us
Anymore oooh oh
I said I can't stop 
Thinking about.. thinking about us
Anymore ooh oh
I said I can't stop.. no
Thinking about.. thinking about this
Anymore ooh oh
And all I've got.. uuuh
Is nothing I want
Anymore ooh oh
Uh, uh, uh, uh
