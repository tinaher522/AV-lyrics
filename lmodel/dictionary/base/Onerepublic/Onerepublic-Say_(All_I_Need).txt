<song artist="Onerepublic" title="Say_(All_I_Need)">
Do you know where your heart is?
Do you think you can find it?
Or did you trade it for something, somewhere, better just to have it?
Do you know where your love is?
Do you think that you lost it?
You felt it so strong, but nothing's turned out how you want it
Well, bless my soul
You're a lonely soul
'Cause you won't let go of anything you hold
"Well, all I need is the air I breathe and a place to rest my head"
Do you know what your fate is?
Are you trying to shake it?
You're doing your best dance, your best look
You're praying that you'll make it
Well, bless my soul
You're a lonely soul
'Cause you won't let go of anything you hold
"Well, all I need is the air I breathe and a place to rest my head
(Say) All I need is the air I breathe and a place to rest my head"
Do you think you can find it?
Do you think you can find it?
Do you think you can find it better than you had it?
Do you think you can find it?
Do you think you can find it?
Do you think you can find it, yeah better than you had it? (better than you had it)
"(Say) All I need is the air I breathe and a place to rest my head
(Say) All I need is the air I breathe and a place to rest my head"
Do you know where the end is?
Do you think you can see it?
Well, until you get there, go on, go ahead and scream it
Just say...
