<song artist="Onerepublic" title="All_The_Right_Moves">
All the right friends in all the right places, so yeah, we're goin' down
They got all the right moves and all the right faces, so yeah, we're goin' down
Let's paint the picture of the perfect place
They got it better than what anyone's told you
They'll be the King of Hearts, and you're the Queen of Spades
Then we'll fight for you like we were your soldiers
I know we got it good, but they got it made
And their grass is getting greener each day
I know things are looking up, but soon they'll take us down
Before anybody's knowin' our name
They got
All the right friends in all the right places, so yeah, we're goin' down
They got all the right moves and all the right faces, so yeah, we're goin' down
Everybody knows, everybody knows where we're goin', yeah, we're goin' down
Everybody knows, everybody knows where we're goin', yeah, we're goin' down
Do you think I'm special?
Do you think I'm nice, am I bright enough to shine in your spaces?
Between the noise you hear, and the sound you like
Are we just sinking in a ocean of faces?
It can't be possible that rain could fall
Only when it's over our heads
The sun is shining everyday, but it's far away
Over their world instead, they got, they got
All the right friends in all the right places, so yeah, we're goin' down
They got all the right moves and all the right faces, so yeah, we're goin' down
Everybody knows, everybody knows where we're goin', yeah, we're goin' down
Everybody knows, everybody knows where we're goin', yeah, we're goin' down
It don't matter what you see, I know I could never be
Someone that'll look like you
It don't matter what you say, I know I could never fake
Someone that could sound like you
All the right friends in all the right places, (so yeah, we're goin' down)
All the right moves and all the right faces, (so yeah, we're goin' down)
All the right friends in all the right places, (so yeah, we're goin' down)
They got all the right moves and all the right faces, so yeah, we're goin' down
Everybody knows, everybody knows where we're goin', yeah, we're goin' down
Everybody knows, everybody knows where we're goin', yeah, we're goin' down
All the right moves
All the right moves
