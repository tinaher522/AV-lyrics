<song artist="Onerepublic" title="It's_A_Shame">
I tried to get to you,
Pushing in vain, to break me through.
I tried with all I had,
You left me standing empty handed.
Well, time has passed, nothing ever lasts, so..
Now, you confess that you need me,
And now you release what you're feeling,
But how is this supposed to ever be the same?
Oh it's a shame,
It's a shame,
Oh it's a shame,
No, it's a shame.
You got the best of me,
got me to reason, got me on my knee yah.
My love, I lost my pride,
Searching for something I couldn't find.
Well time apart has brought a change of heart,
And now, you confess that you need me,
And now you release what you're feeling,
But how is this supposed to ever be the same?
Oh it's a shame,
It's a shame,
Oh it's a shame,
No, It's a shame.
(Oooohhooohhooohhh)
You got the best of me,
I said love got the best of me.
Saying you've got the best of me,
And I'm afraid, 
We'll never be the same.
It's a shame
It's a shame
Oh it's a shame
No, it's a shame.
It's a shame
It's a shame
Oh it's a shame
No it's a shame.
