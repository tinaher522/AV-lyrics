<song artist="Onerepublic" title="Mercy">
Angel of mercy, 
How did you find me?
Where did you read my story?
Pulled from the papers, 
Desperate and hardened 
Seeking a momentary fix
All I wanted to say, 
All I wanted to do
Has fallen apart now
All I wanted to feel, 
I wanted to love
It's all my fault now
A tragedy, I fear
Angel of mercy,
How did you find me? 
How did you pick me up again?
Angel of mercy, 
How did you move me? 
Why am I on my feet again?
And I see you
Whoa whoa whoa
I feel you
Whoa whoa whoa
Fortress of daylight, 
Caught me on standby
Waiting to catch the quickest plane
Fly me to nowhere, it's better than somewhere
That's where I've been and nothing's changed
All I wanted to say, 
All I wanted to do
Is fall apart now
All I wanted to feel, 
I wanted to love
It's all my fault now
A tragedy for sure
Angel of mercy,
How did you find me? 
How did you pick me up again?
Angel of mercy, 
How did you move me? 
Why am I on my feet again?
And I see you
Whoa whoa whoa
I feel you
Whoa whoa whoa
I'm so lost in you
A tragedy, it seemed to be, but what now?
What now?
A tragedy, it seemed to be, but what now?
Angel of mercy,
How did you find me? 
How did you pick me up again?
Angel of mercy,
How did you move me?
Why am I on my feet again?
And I see you
Whoa whoa whoa
And I feel you
Whoa whoa whoa
I feel you
Oh oh, whoa
I feel you
Oho oho ohoo
Hmmm
