<song artist="Onerepublic" title="Au_Revoir">
Today I'm not myself
And you, you're someone else
And all these wounds don't fake
And all the stars can quit
What a peculiar state we re in
What a peculiar state we re in
Let's play a game
Where all of the lives we meet can change
Let's play a game
Where nothing that we can see, the same
We'll find all the pieces to the puzzles
Slipping out under the locks
I can show you how many moves to check mate right now
We can take a part this life we re building
And pack it up inside a box
All that really matters is we re doing it right now
Right now
We'll find all the pieces to the puzzles
Slipping out under the locks
I can show you how many moves to check mate right now
We can take a part this life we re building
And pack it up inside a box
All that really matters is we re doing it right now
Right now
