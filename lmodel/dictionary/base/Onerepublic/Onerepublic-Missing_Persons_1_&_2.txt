<song artist="Onerepublic" title="Missing_Persons_1_&_2">
Used to come around here every day
Now you break in
Used to be the one that's not ashamed
Now you're shaming
Lost in all the wars we fought
Never sorrow
Now everything about you is the scars of tomorrow
And I wonder where you are
Now I wonder where you
Tear yourself down
Pick yourself up
Everything changed when you got along
Seven point one
Took it all down
Now suddenly you can't even be found
I said all night long
A missing person's in the window
Staring at me
Saying things I can't hear
A missing person's in the window
Staring at me
Haven't seen them in years
First things first
Second in command
Right as I'm trying to change my plan
Second gonna die
Oh he cant breathe
Everybody's staring straight at me
You spend it all chasing those lies
I don't really wanna take that chance
I don't really wanna do that dance
I don't know what to do till you say
Oh I don't wanna let you go
But I cant keep holding on
Skies of silver, Stars of gold
And now you know just what you like
So far this love is all I have
So far this hurt is all I have
Missing person at the window
Missing person at the window
A missing person at the window
Missing person at the window
I wonder where you are
I wonder where you are
I wonder where you are
Wonder where you...
