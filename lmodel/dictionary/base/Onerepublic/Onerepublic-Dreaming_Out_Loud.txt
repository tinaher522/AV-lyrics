<song artist="Onerepublic" title="Dreaming_Out_Loud">
Well hello sir, we live for Mondays
Confident we'll get there someday
Pushing all the papers to a wealthy man
Might I say, a beautiful tie
You're wearing, how do you find
Such lovely polka dots and stripes these days?
Break, all my thoughts hit the floor
Like I'm makin' the score
I'm the king of the world, I'm a popular man
Count by zero's to ten
If you can't, well I can
Don't let any one wake me
I'm dreaming out loud
Dreaming out loud
And all at once, so familiar it seems
I'm dreaming out loud
Dreaming out loud
Can't find a puzzle to fit in the piece
A part of me
Curtain calls and sanctuaries
Actors in the cloth, they freak me out
I get my purpose in the magazines
Famous, how they make you feel grand
They're always there to hold your hand
In times of trouble, they're best of friends
Break, all my thoughts hit the floor
Like I'm makin' the score
I'm the king of the world, I'm a popular man
Count by zero's to ten
If you can't, well I can
Don't let any one wake me
I'm dreaming out loud
Dreaming out loud
And all at once, so familiar it seems
I'm dreaming out loud
Dreaming out loud
Cant find a puzzle to fit in the piece
A part of me
They don't care what you say
They don't care what you think
All they care, what you do
Long as you're off beat
Take a look at yourself
Storm tries to come and wreck my world
No, I won't let it
Stumbled escape, through anchored drapes
No way to bedding
I'm dreaming out loud
Dreaming out loud
And all at once, so familiar it seems
I'm dreaming out loud
Dreaming out loud
Can't find a puzzle to fit in the piece
I'm dreaming out loud
Out loud
Can't find a puzzle to fit in the piece
A part of me
Well hello sir, we live for Mondays
