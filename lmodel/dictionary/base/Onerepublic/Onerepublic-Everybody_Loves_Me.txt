<song artist="Onerepublic" title="Everybody_Loves_Me">
Well hail Caesar, shadow on my backseat
And her friends all standin' right in front of me
Worldwide from the Cimmaron to Turkey
Open up, said everybody loves me
And you don't have to make a sound
'Cause they got what you need
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Got love for the people that have warned you
God love all your sentimental virtue
Eight balls with the takers that'll make you
Late calls with the lovers that'll hate you
And you don't have to make a sound
They got what you need
What you need
Make ya say oh my, feels just like I don't try,
Looks so good, I might die,
All I know is everybody loves me
Head down, swingin' to my own sound, flashes in my face now
All I know is everybody loves me
Everybody loves me
Well I pray the music don't stop till I turn grey
Stars forever like John Sousa never fade
He had a beautiful child, named her Desir√©e
Hope I'm remembered for the things that I never made
'Cause you don't have to make a sound
When they got what you need
Make ya say oh my, it feels just like I don't try,
Looks so good I might die,
All I know is everybody loves me
Head down, swingin' to my own sound, flashes in my face now,
All I know is everybody loves me
Everybody loves me
Everybody, everybody, oh, everybody, everybody
Don't need my health
Got my name and got my wealth,
I stare at the sun
Just for kicks all by myself,
I lose track of time
So I might be past my prime, but I'm feelin' oh so good, yeah
Oh my, feels just like I don't try,
Looks so good I might die,
All I know is everybody loves me (everybody)
Head down, swingin' to my own sound, flashes in my face now,
All I know is everybody love me
Oh I said, everybody
Everybody, don't you know who you are?
I say, everybody, everybody, everybody
Whoa
