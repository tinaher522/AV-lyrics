<song artist="Onerepublic" title="All_We_Are">
I tried to paint you a picture, the colors were all wrong
Black and white didn't fit ya, and all along
You were shaded with patience, and strokes of everything
That I need just to make it, but I can see that
Lord knows I failed you time and again
But you and me are alright
We won't say our goodbyes
You know it's better that way
We won't break, we won't die
It's just a moment of change
All we are, all we are, is everything that's right
All we need, all we need, a lover's alibi
I walked a minute in your shoes, they never would have fit
I figured there's nothing to lose, I need to get
Some perspective on these words, before I write them down
You're an island and my ship has run aground
Lord knows I'll fail you time and again
But you and me are alright, yeah
We won't say our goodbyes
You know it's better that way
We won't break, we won't die
It's just a moment of change
All we are, all we are, is everything that's right
All we need, all we need, a lover's alibi
And every single day that I can breathe
You change my philosophy
I'm never gonna let you pass me by
So don't say your goodbyes, you know it's better that way
We won't break, we won't die
It's just a moment of change, yeah
So don't say your goodbyes, you know it's better that way
We won't break, we won't die
It's just a moment of change, yeah
All we are, all we are, is everything that's right
All we need, all we need, a lover's alibi, yeah
So don't say your goodbyes, you know it's better that way
We won't break, we won't die
