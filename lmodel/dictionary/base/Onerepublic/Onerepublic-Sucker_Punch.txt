<song artist="Onerepublic" title="Sucker_Punch">
Push and pull me closer
Habit forming, you should stay far away
Colored caffeine, magic
Lights my night im aware of my face, too late
After all is said and done,
i am not the one,
i am not the one.
After all is said and done,
you are still the one,
you are still the one.
(oohhh)
Perfect measured pieces,
fit together you and i,
hey bright eyes.
Dont deny my weakness,
your the jaded,
im the strength right behind you
Behind you
After all is said and done,
i am not the one,
i am not the one.
After all is said and done,
you are still the one,
you are still the one.
(oooh, ooh)
(whoaaa-a-a-a, oohh, ohh oh oh)
After all is said and done,
i am not the one,
i am not the one.
After all is said and done,
you are still the one,
you are still the one.
(oohhh, oh oh oh. oooo, ooooo)
(oohhh, oh oh oh.. ooo,ooo)
