<song artist="Chris_Stapleton" title="The_Devil_Named_Music">
We drove all night to Billings, Montana
Flew into Utah, slept there all day
I can't remember stopping in Denver
Yeah, I live my illusion that somebody needs me to play
And sometimes I'm drunk
And sometimes I'm stoned
And yes, I get tired of being alone
I miss my son
And I miss my wife
But the devil named music is taking my life
Now I sold my soul a long time ago
I put it in a six string and a sad melody
And I'm sometimes a winner, most times a loser
If the crowd gets into it, it'll all feel the same way to me
Sometimes I'm drunk
Sometimes I'm stoned
And yes, I get tired of being alone
And I miss my daughter
And I miss my wife
But the devil named music is taking my life
And sometimes I'm drunk
And sometimes I'm stoned
And yes, I get tired of being alone
I miss my son
And I miss my wife
But the devil named music is taking my life
Sometimes I'm drunk
Sometimes I'm stoned
And yes, I get tired of being alone
And I miss my daughter
I miss my wife
But the devil named music is taking my life
