<song artist="Chris_Stapleton" title="Might_As_Well_Get_Stoned">
Well, she said, she didn't love me
And kicked me out the door
Now I'm livin' in one room
And sleeping on the floor
Think I'm gonna kick my boots off
And put some music on
And since I'm all alone
I might as well get stoned
I might as well get stoned
Get it off my mind
Ain't got a thing to do
All I've got is time
The bottle's all I've had
To be a friend of mine
And since my whiskey's gone
I might as well get stoned
Now every time I watch the TV
Another soldier dies
Another brother's gone
Another mother cries
Now I know they've got a job to do
But if I had one wish
I wish they'd all come home
So we could all get stoned
I might as well get stoned
Get it off my mind
Ain't got shit to do
All I've got is time
The bottle's all I've had
To be a friend of mine
And since my whiskey's gone
I might as well get stoned
