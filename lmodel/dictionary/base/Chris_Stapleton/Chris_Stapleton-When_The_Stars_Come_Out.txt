<song artist="Chris_Stapleton" title="When_The_Stars_Come_Out">
I was looking for change of scene
You were looking at a magazine
It was red carpets and limousines
And the grass seemed so much greener
All we wanted was to get there fast
So we packed up everything we had
Running on hope and a tank of gas
Like dreams ain't just for dreamers
We couldn't wait to leave that life behind
Trying to find salvation in that city limit sign
And one of those LA nights
When the stars come out
Oh, the stars come out and shine
And they burn so bright
They drown the downtown lights
When the stars come out
Oh, when the stars come out
Everybody's, somebody, someday
Everybody's got a part to play
Everybody's trying to find a way
To say what needs sayin'
Everybody's got a friend of a friend
Somebody that can get you in
Begging angels for a sin
In a game that we're all playing
You and I, we're gamblers holding cards that we can't see
And I'm betting on you, you're betting on me
One of those LA nights
When the stars come out
Oh, the stars come out and shine
And they burn so bright
They drown the downtown lights
When the stars come out
Oh, when the stars come out
Down on the freeway
The sun is out of sight
And I got a feeling
Tonight might be the night
Yeah, tonight might be the night
One of those LA nights
When the stars come out
Oh, the stars come out and shine
And they burn so bright
They drown the downtown lights
When the stars come out
Oh, when the stars come out
When the stars come out
Oh, when the stars come out
