<song artist="Chris_Stapleton" title="Sometimes_I_Cry">
There are days that I can walk around like I'm alright
And I pretend to wear a smile on my face
And I could keep the pain from comin' out of my eyes
But sometimes, sometimes
Sometimes I cry, cry
Sometimes I cry
When I can't do nothing else
Everybody keeps tellin' me to move on
Oh but I can't seem to go anywhere without you
'Cause ever since and every single night you been gone
Sometimes, sometimes
Sometimes I cry, cry
Sometimes I cry
When I can't do nothing else
Sometimes I cry
Sometimes I cry
Sometimes I cry
When I can't do nothing else
