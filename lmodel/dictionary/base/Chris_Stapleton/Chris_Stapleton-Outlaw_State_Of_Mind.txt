<song artist="Chris_Stapleton" title="Outlaw_State_Of_Mind">
Cut my teeth on Daddy's old LGO
And I lost my mind somewhere in New Mexico
And TW put a snake on my back
I keep a red bar on my side
And there's people all across the land
From East Kentucky downtown Alabam
Whole lotta like I am all the time
In an outlaw state of mind
I got friends that know how to have a good time
Yeah, they roll their own and drink Carolina shine
I've seen the devil in a dark coal mine
I've been higher than a Georgia pine
And there's people all across the land
From West Virginia to the Rio Grande
Whole lotta like I am all the time all the time
I'm in an outlaw state of mind
And there's people all across the land
From New York out to old San Fran
Just don't give a damn all the time
in an outlaw state of mind
