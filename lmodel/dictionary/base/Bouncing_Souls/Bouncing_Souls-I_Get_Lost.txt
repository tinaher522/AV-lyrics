<song artist="Bouncing_Souls" title="I_Get_Lost">
I don't want to do anything to prove myself to you
I don't want to be something I'm not
Every time I try, every time I chase
Something that's wrong or right
I get lost in my mind
I get lost in that lie
I get lost with the idea I have something to prove
All I have to do is make my way
Make the best of whatever comes my way
Whatever comes my way
Whatever comes my way
I don't want anything this world can give me
A lot of stuff makes me feel so empty
Every time I try, every time I chase
Something I want from you
I get lost in my mind
I get lost in that lie
I get lost with the idea I have something to lose
All I have to do is make my way
Make the best of whatever comes my way
Whatever comes my way
Whatever comes my way
