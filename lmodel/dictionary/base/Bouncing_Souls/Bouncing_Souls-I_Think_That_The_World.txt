<song artist="Bouncing_Souls" title="I_Think_That_The_World">
No days and nights could brighten my life
As much as one moment with you
This is the way life seems to go
It's not the way I wanted it to be
I got it wrong, but that's okay
You and I agree it's great this way
I'm in love with you
You're in love with me
I haven't felt this good in years
All my fear disappeared
And the world can go its own way
In fact, it can fade away
Yeah, the world can go its own way
In fact, it can fade away
The touch of your hand hits me so deep
I look into your eyes endlessly
Forget who I was and want to be
Man, do I feel so free
And I'm in love with you
You're in love with me
I haven't felt this good in years
All my fear disappeared
And the world can go its own way
In fact, it can fade away
The world can go its own way
In fact, it can fade away
I'm in love with you
You're in love with me
I haven't felt this good in years
All my fear I carried with me just disappears, disappears
And the world can go its own way
In fact, it can fade away
And the world can go its own way
In fact, it can fade away
Fade away, fade away
Fade away, fade away
Fade away, fade away
Fade away, fade away
