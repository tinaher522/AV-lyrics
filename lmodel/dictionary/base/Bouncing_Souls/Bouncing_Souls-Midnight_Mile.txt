<song artist="Bouncing_Souls" title="Midnight_Mile">
I've been dreaming under unfamiliar skies
Talking to strangers lost in night's passing disguise
Why am I so alone, why can I say it all in song
But come up empty face to face? Words I wish I could erase
I've been hiding under unfamiliar skies
Talking to strangers lost in night's passing disguise
Take this heart, put it with my bones
Put 'em in a box and send 'em home
We've been dreaming alone under different stars
Of a thousand smiles and of a thousand scars
You walk me to the sun, we walk through the rain
We pass through the love and bask in the pain
I'm a midnight mile from your home
Can I come in and warm my bones?
I'm a midnight mile from your home
Can I come in and warm my bones?
Maybe it's time I'll get it right
Maybe this time I'll get it right
