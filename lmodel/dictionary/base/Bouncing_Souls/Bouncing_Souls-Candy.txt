<song artist="Bouncing_Souls" title="Candy">
I know a guy who's tough but sweet
He's so fine he can't be beat
he's the only one i desire
Sets the summer sun on fire
i want candy,i want candy
i want candy I want candy
goin to see him when the sun goes down
your the guy the doctor ordered
your so sweet you make my mouth water
i want candy, i want candy, i want candy, i want candy
candy on the beach theres nothing better
i like candy when he's wrapped in a sweater
someday soon i'll make you mine
then i'll have candy all the time
i want candy, i want candy, i want candy, i want
