The first wedensday i saw her
there smiling at me with here blue eyes
and curly hair i couldn't wait till next week
to make the stop see her at the
quick check paper drop.
Every wedensday we'd count the papers
we'd have a laugh at the people in their suits
no one seemed to notice how she was different
but i did and i knew. Another wedensday came and it
seemed it was right so i wrote her a note that i
hoped she would like dear
Kiah would you like to go with me to the boardwalk
what fun it will be
we'll eat cotton candy and we'll get french
fries with vinegar and get a
plate of funnel cake then we'll go on the
zipper look out on the ocean
and puke it all up all the people will scream
we can have a laugh what do
you say? that's what it said in the note.
Another week went by
and she never called another week came and
she wished she had she just
broke up with her fiance and things were kinda crazy
with her i said i understood, another week went by
and she never called but i thought
about the way she looked at me and said to myself maybe..
i pulled into the quick check at 6am to see the sun coming up
when i walked in Kiah wasn't there. The manager said
she quit she isn't here do you want me to
help you count the papers?.
