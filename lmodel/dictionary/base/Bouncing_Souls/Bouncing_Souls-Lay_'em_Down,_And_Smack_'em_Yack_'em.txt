<song artist="Bouncing_Souls" title="Lay_'em_Down,_And_Smack_'em_Yack_'em">
In the house walking around I found my way
outside on the icy ground and up
the street to my old school I thought
of other places that might be cool
cooler to be in right then instead
instead of walking out west or maybe
costa rica paris, france or poleynesia
I bought a coffee at the old store I used to
steal gum there to kill off that boredom
I used to feel all the time restless
and bored walking on the ice to my
old school i'm done with being restless and
trying to be cool
