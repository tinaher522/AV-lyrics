<song artist="Bouncing_Souls" title="Kids_And_Heroes">
Hey, where have you gone?
You used to be the one that we looked up to
It seemed like nothing could break you down
How high was your price and was it worth it?
Nothing in life is a sure bet anyway, you're gone
I guess you weren't here from the start
In the end, it's all a question of heart
Hey, where have you gone?
You used to be the one that we looked up to
It seemed like nothing could break you down
How high was your price and was it worth it?
Nothing in life is a sure bet anyway, you're gone
I guess you weren't here from the start
In the end, it's all a question of heart
Hey, where did it go?
Everything we fought for and everything it meant
Maybe we were just naive, but I still believe
There are only a few things that really belong to me
Who I am, who I was
And who I want to be
Hey, where have I gone?
I used to be the one looking for the hero in some far off place
Blindly ever forward, never knowing all along
The truth was right there in my own song
