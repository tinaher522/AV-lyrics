<song artist="Bouncing_Souls" title="Lean_On_Sheena">
Did you intimidate her?
Her mother says you wouldn't let her use the phone
Or were you intoxicated
Past the point of knowing what was going on?
Better yet, don't forget, leave the keys on the TV set
Hoping you're gone for the corner bar
Here we are after dark, knocking back the Makers Mark
Scrounging up ten dollars from my buddy's car, and
Lean on Sheena
She leans on me a lot
Hold on, hold on
Hold onto what you've got
Intimidate her
How'd you make her feel worse than she did before?
And I heard you came back later
Had the upstairs neighbors banging on the floor
Better yet, don't forget, leave the keys on the TV set
Hoping you're gone for the corner bar
Here we are after dark, knocking back the Makers Mark
Scrounging up ten dollars from my buddy's car, and
Lean on Sheena
She leans on me a lot
Hold on, hold on
Hold onto what you've got
Intimidate her
Her mother says you wouldn't let her use the phone
Were you intoxicated
Past the point of knowing what was going on?
Better yet, don't forget, leave the keys on the TV set
Hoping you're gone for the corner bar
Here we are after dark, knocking back the Makers Mark
Scrounging up ten dollars from my buddy's car, and
Lean on Sheena
She leans on me a lot
Hold on, hold on
Hold onto what you've got
Lean on Sheena
She leans on me a lot
Hold on, hold on
Hold onto what you've got
Hold onto what you've got
Better yet, don't forget, grab your keys off the TV set
Say goodbye to the corner bar
Not a friend 'til the end, she's never coming back again
Now it's on my mind and in my heart, and
Lean on Sheena
She leans on me a lot
Hold on, hold on
Hold onto what you've got
Lean on Sheena
She leans on me a lot
Hold on, hold on
Hold onto what you've got
