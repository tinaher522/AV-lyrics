<song artist="Bouncing_Souls" title="Mental_Bits">
The sun is shining in the breeze
Free from all the world's worries
I'm walking with the city's beat
Under the palms swinging in the trees
Move out, move on
Life is here, singing her song
Move out, move on
The sun is shining as we walk along, move on
We've been singing a worried song
In our hearts now for so long
All of the past, it can't be wrong
Let's let it go and move along
And move out, move on
Life is here, singing her song
Move out, move on
The sun is shining as we walk along, move on
The sky is always on my side
Trouble's part of my joy ride
Dramas crash, emotions clash
We have to live with the past
I'm gonna take the scenic route
Battle the traffic with a better view
It's better not to fight alone
All together, let's move along
Move out, move on
Life is here, singing her song
Move out, move on
The sun is shining as we walk along
Move out, move on
Life is here, singing her song
Move out, move on
The sun is shining as we walk along, move on
