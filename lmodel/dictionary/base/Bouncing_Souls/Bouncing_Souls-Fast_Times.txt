<song artist="Bouncing_Souls" title="Fast_Times">
Here we go again saying the same things
White noise creates a hiss of ten thousand little things
Hypnotizing our minds broken down into parts
Is this modern fix just breaking our hearts?
We asked for it, we got it
We paid for it, we want it
We love it, we hate it
We own it 'cause we made it
There's no time to kill, no time to care
We try to look to the past but it isn't there
Hypnotizing our lives right from the start
Is this modern fix just breaking our hearts?
We asked for it, we got it
We paid for it, we want it
We love it, we hate it
We own it 'cause we made it
Trouble on my mind getting lost in these fast times
I'm falling behind in these fast times
Trouble on my mind getting lost in these fast times
I'm falling behind in these fast times, in these fast times
Oh yeah, these fast times
Out on the information highway
Staring out at the lines maybe I lost my way
Electric fog rolling over me
I lost all visibility
We asked for it, we got it
We paid for it, we want it
We love it, we hate it
We own it 'cause we made it
Trouble on my mind getting lost in these fast times
I'm falling behind in these fast times
Trouble on my mind getting lost in these fast times
I'm falling behind in these fast times, in these fast times
Oh yeah, these fast times
Lost in these fast times
Oh yeah, lost in these fast times
