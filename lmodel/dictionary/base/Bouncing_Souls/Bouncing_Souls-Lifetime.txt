<song artist="Bouncing_Souls" title="Lifetime">
Just like a sunny day can turn all dark and gray, this game goes on and on
Out on the streets, broken dreams, they come so cheap
No one can leave me for dead, I've got one good fight left in me tonight
And the most beautiful girl in my head
Sometimes she comes to me in a song
Sometimes she comes in a dream
She's all the joy in my heart
She's everything that I see
Days they come and days go by, sometimes we fight and I don't know why
I'll give it all up to her
Everything I did and said, I've got all I want now in my sight
And the most beautiful girl in my head
Sometimes she comes to me in a song
Sometimes she comes in a dream
She's all the joy in my heart
She's everything that I see
When we're together, there is no time, there is no space
When we're together, everything is in its place
Turn myself inside-out for her, my endless love is without form
Let my heart be the light that guides her through the storm
Tomorrow's a lifetime away
She's all I want today
Tomorrow's a lifetime away
She's all I want today
