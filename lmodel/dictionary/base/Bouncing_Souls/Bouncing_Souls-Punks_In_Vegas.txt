<song artist="Bouncing_Souls" title="Punks_In_Vegas">
I went away my friends and I
To the heart of darkness
Maybe not the best place in the world
But something always brings me back
All these days they've run past
Life's going by so fast
All the best things that I have
No one can take them from me
Here's to the memories
Wish I could always feel that way
So fucking out of my head
I was running at full steam
I'll sleep when I'm dead
Maybe not the best day of my life
But probably in the top five
I left that place with such a high
I didn't want to say goodbye
Here's to the memories
