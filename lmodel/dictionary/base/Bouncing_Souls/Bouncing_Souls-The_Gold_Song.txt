<song artist="Bouncing_Souls" title="The_Gold_Song">
I saw you from across the street today
My heart skipped a beat today
Reminding me of those lost days and glory never fades
Never fades, fades away
After years and miles, my broken feet
Walk back to you up this broken street
I guess the years went by, but the years just made you shine
And never fade, fade away
I heard someone say
That nothing gold can stay
But there's a love in all our souls
And it shines like gold
I saw you from across the street today
My heart skipped a beat today
Reminding me of those lost days
And glory never fades
Years passed by and you remind me
Those things will always find me
Young hearts are made of gold that never fades away
Never fades, fades away
I heard someone say
That nothing gold can stay
But there's a love in all our souls
And it shines like gold
As the years pass by
A young heart beats inside
These dreams of yours and mine that time can't take away
Take away, take away
I heard someone say
That nothing gold can stay
But there's a love in all our souls
And it shines like gold
I heard someone say
That nothing gold can stay
But there's a love in all our souls
And it shines like gold
And it shines like gold
It shines like gold
