<song artist="Bouncing_Souls" title="True_Believers">
I've met some people along the way
Some of them split, some of them stay
Some of them walk, some walk on by
Got a few friends I'll love 'til I die
From all these people I've tried to learn
Some of them shine, some of them burn
Some of them rise, some of them fall
But good or bad, I've known them all
We live our life in our own way
Never really listened to what they say
The kind of faith that doesn't fade away
We are the true believers
We are the true believers
Well, you can fight or you can run
Hide under a rock 'til the war is won
Play it safe and don't make a sound
But not us, we won't back down
True believers all the way
You and I
We live our life in our own way
Never really listened to what they say
The kind of faith that doesn't fade away
We are the true believers
We are the true believers
We live our life in our own way
Never really listened to what they say
The kind of faith that doesn't fade away
We are the true believers
We are the true believers
True believers
