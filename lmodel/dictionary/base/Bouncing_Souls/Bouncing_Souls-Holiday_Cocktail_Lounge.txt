<song artist="Bouncing_Souls" title="Holiday_Cocktail_Lounge">
Happy hour's next door
But you'll have to brave the downpour
I'm staying here where I can get a song
Free with my drink to smooth things along
The bartender, he looks kind of sauced
But he always knows what's going down
It's all you carry yourself
Here at the Holiday cocktail lounge
I didn't talk or say much
But I got to know a lot
The greatest delicacies of Spain
The effects of rain on your brain
Another drink with my free song
The usual things
They come and they move along
Here at the Holiday cocktail lounge
I have heard some places can change how you feel
It's not something you can see, but I think that it's real
Words that were spoken of passing thoughts in the mind
Somebody just rolled through and they left them behind
Maybe they sat in this very stool
And didn't make a sound
They just came and went
Here at the Holiday cocktail lounge
