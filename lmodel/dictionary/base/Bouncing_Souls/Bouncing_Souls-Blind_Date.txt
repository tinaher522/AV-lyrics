<song artist="Bouncing_Souls" title="Blind_Date">
I wish that you could see the you that I see
Not some bullshit glamor fantasy
Put down those magazines and see
See a real beauty
I wish that you could see the glory that I see
Shining like the winter sun
I wish that you could see
See the true glory
Wish there was something I could do to make you see
Wish there was something I could say, but you won't hear me
I guess there's some things that I can't explain
Some things that I could never change
I read your thoughts in your eyes
When you look at me
I see the real you when you smile
I see the real beauty
I see the real beauty
