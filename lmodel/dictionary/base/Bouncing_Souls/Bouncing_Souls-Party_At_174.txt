<song artist="Bouncing_Souls" title="Party_At_174">
We're gonna have a party
We're gonna have a party
We're gonna have a party
We're gonna have a party, it's gonna pay the bills
There's gonna be some beer
There's gonna be a show
Let's go call the wall
Let everybody know
Ernie ate five fritters
He's dying for another
We won't invite your dad
But we will invite your mother
We're gonna have a party
We're gonna have a party
We're gonna have a party
We're gonna have a party, it's gonna pay the bills
Stevie D. showed up in his Gremlin
He's running from the pigs
We tried to clean up the backyard
But we got no help from Wig
Ill Phil DeVille and Cool Hand Bill
They came to dance, they came to swill
Timmy Chunks got lost on route 8
He can't drive, he's from Queens
We're gonna have a party
We're gonna have a party
We're gonna have a party
We're gonna have a party, it's gonna pay the bills
The sticks and stones crew brought some wine
They'll be here for a while
The dog is dancing in the driveway
Pickin' chicken style
The dairy sill girls and the demos are here
Pablo's playing darts
Lando's in the driveway
Lando's breaking hearts
We're gonna have a party
We're gonna have a party
We're gonna have a party
We're gonna have a party
We're gonna have a party
