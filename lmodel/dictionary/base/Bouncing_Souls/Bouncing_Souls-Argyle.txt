<song artist="Bouncing_Souls" title="Argyle">
I know I'm not a bad guy
when I try to do what's right
everyone who comes to me don't understand or see my plight
everything I've ever done
all the plans I've had in sight
always missed and gone wrong in a way
until I gave up and said alright, alright, alright,
Let me alone cause no one wants to be
hanging around with someone messing up like me
I guess my way isn't good enough
when I try I just keep on wrecking stuff
it seems everybody knows but me
how to go what to do and where to be
everywhere I go they all talk the same
they don't even have to try
they make me feel so lame, so lame, so lame
Friends and jobs have come and gone
no matter what I do it goes on and on
I wonder if you sometimes feel this way
and do you lay awake at the end of the day
When I lose
every time I win, cause
no one will ever be
messing up stuff and doing things wrong
quite like me
no one will ever be like me
no one will ever be like me
