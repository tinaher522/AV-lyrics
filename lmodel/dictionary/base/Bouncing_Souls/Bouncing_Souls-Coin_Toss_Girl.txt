<song artist="Bouncing_Souls" title="Coin_Toss_Girl">
When she's so cold to me
I'm always in trouble, I never know why
She has two sides, she changes her mind
I just wanna get off this ride
Step aside and let the storm pass me by
When it's good it's great
And we lay side by side
She curls up in my arms
Everything is all right
Don't wanna kill these good vibes
Still it happens all the time
There's no reason why
Call it in the air, everything's fair
I love you like a fool, what can I do?
My coin toss girl
Call it in the air, everything's fair
I love you like a fool, what can I do? What can I do?
My coin toss girl
When she's so cold to me
I'm always in trouble no matter what I try
I get denied, happens all the time
It's a roller coaster ride
Thrills and spills so sky high
I'm so glad she's mine
Yeah, a million reasons why
Call it in the air, everything's fair
I love you like a fool, what can I do?
My coin toss girl
Call it in the air, everything's fair
I love you like a fool, what can I do? What can I do?
My coin toss girl
I think I'd like to marry her
I think I'd like to bury her
I think I'd like to marry her
I think I'd like to bury her
Call it in the air, everything's fair
I love you like a fool, what can I do?
My coin toss girl
Call it in the air, everything's fair
I love you like a fool, what can I do? What can I do?
My coin toss girl
My coin toss girl
Oh yeah, my coin toss girl
I play it so cool, I love you like a fool
My coin toss girl
Oh yeah, my coin toss girl
