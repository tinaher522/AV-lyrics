<song artist="Bouncing_Souls" title="Dirt">
I wanna be dirty cuz i don't about the clothes I wear I'll be dirty on the street to feel alive it makes me feel alive when i'm dirty i feel clean Clean in my head every inch of me is covered with everything said So give in to the dirty fingers So give in to the dirty streets So give in to the dirty people So give in to the filth So give in
