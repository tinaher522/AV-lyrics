<song artist="Bouncing_Souls" title="Gone">
It was a cloudy night, or so it looked to me
I felt so lost, I couldn't say why
I needed strength to change my mind, but these ghosts stick to me like glue
Hating life, believing I was no good
It was a darkness all my own
A song played on the radio
It went straight to my heart
I carried it with me until the darkness was gone
It was a cloudy night, or so it looked to me
I felt so lost, I couldn't say why
I built this cloud to live in, it was a bunch of lies in my mind
The world wants me to believe it, so I had to change my mind
It was a darkness all my own
A song played on the radio
It went straight to my heart
I carried it with me until the darkness was gone
I built this cloud, I can break it
The world can't change how I feel
Because I know it's a lie
My heart is real
