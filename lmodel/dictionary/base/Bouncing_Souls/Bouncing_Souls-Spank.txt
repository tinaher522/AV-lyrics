<song artist="Bouncing_Souls" title="Spank">
I woke in the night Looking around there was no familiar sight Where could i be in some long gone place far away where life never drags In the heat of excitement that's where I am nervous nervous but lost Lost in the moment Leaving the grind behind It felt good to leave it behind One second of relief one second my heart leaped I was alive and ready to dive off of the diving board Ready for anything where am I now I don't care cause i'm gone Long gone from the grind of life In that one second i knew it was all in my mind My room was dark it was just the same no challenge there to meet No new life but that's o.k. the grind is mine to live today ...it felt good to leave it behind
