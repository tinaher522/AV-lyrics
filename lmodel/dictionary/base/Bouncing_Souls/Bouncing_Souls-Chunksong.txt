<song artist="Bouncing_Souls" title="Chunksong">
Too old to bother, too young to care
Standing all alone, lost in my mind somewhere
Searching for answers, so many unknown questions
I've got to take another step on this sole adventure
Why is it that I can't see
What it is I need to be?
I wish I had some idea
About my destiny
I don't know what it is I'm looking for
Can't find it anywhere, I never felt like this before
I've got no ideas what it is I'm trying to find
Got a strange feeling I'm lost in my own mind
Why is it that I can't see
What it is I need to be?
I wish I had some idea
About my destiny
Too old to bother, too young to care
Too old to bother, too young to care
Too old to bother, too young to care
Too old to bother, too young to give a shit
