<song artist="Bouncing_Souls" title="The_New_Thing">
There was a time we had so little
But we thought it was so much
There was a time we had no control
And we lost our touch
So much emotion, so many days passed
So many things we thought would last
And everything, it seemed so big
So much invested in the past
We're still dreaming
We're still believing
No longer looking for the new thing
No longer looking for the new thing
Sometimes we look, but it's hard to see
Lost inside a memory
Thinking of all the good times gone by
But that was yesterday's high
We're still dreaming
We're still believing
No longer looking for the new thing
No longer looking for the new thing
Wasted too much time
Chasing dragons in our dreams
Funny how hard it was to see
Life's not so complicated, so complicated as it seems
There was a time we had so little
And a little was enough
It took some time, but now we see
Everything's inside of us
We're still dreaming
We're still believing
No longer looking for the new thing
No longer looking for the new thing
