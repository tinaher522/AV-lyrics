<song artist="Bouncing_Souls" title="Night_On_Earth">
Passed some time on the stoop on the block were we used to sit
I thought about it all too much I thought so hard i couldn't see
Pete rode by on his Hutch Passed some time on the stoop on the
block were we used to sit i looked down and tied my shoes
I thought about it all too much i looked up and then i knew
I guess these things were meant to be and there's no use fighting
what's in me Night on earth Passed some time walking around
looking for something to be when i stopped to look around
all the music was different to me All these places we used
to go when i loved you i didn't see I'll miss you but now
i'll know better next time because i found me
