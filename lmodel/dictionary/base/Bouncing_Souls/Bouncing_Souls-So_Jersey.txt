<song artist="Bouncing_Souls" title="So_Jersey">
The sun shines brightly on a Jersey afternoon
He walked in his parents' footsteps on his way home from school
Those ties that were so sweet also burned under his feet
Now he's ready to walk a path that is new
And he can't turn back
He can't turn back
He can't turn back
Running through the crowds
He made it out alive
Betting everything on himself tonight
She's driving down the shore on a Jersey afternoon
She's driving down the same old road her parents took her through
Hypnotized by those broken lines, broken records lost in time
She's turning down a road that is new
And she can't turn back
No, she can't turn back
She can't turn back
Stepping through the darkness
Into the light
Betting everything on herself tonight
Stepping out of the Asbury Lanes in the midnight snow
The skeleton of this old town feels like it's coming alive
Riots and corruption, New Jersey roots
These songs were the keys to the engines of our growing up
And we wanna say thanks to the music in our lives
Forgive ourselves for all the lies
Send some love to all the lonely
Don't forget we're all one family
Thanks to the music in our lives
For helping us to survive
Lost in one lonely dream
Born to run and live free
The sun shines brightly on us this afternoon
Walking in our own footsteps, a search for something new
And we can't turn back
No, we can't turn back
We can't turn back
Stepping through the darkness
Into the light
We're betting everything, we're betting everything
We're betting everything on ourselves tonight
