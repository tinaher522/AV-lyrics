<song artist="Bouncing_Souls" title="Kids_In_America">
Looking out a dirty old window
Down below the cars in the city go rushing by 
I sit here alone and I wonder why. 
Friday night and everyone's moving 
I can feel the heat but it's soothing heading down. 
I search for the beat in this dirty town. 
Down town the young ones are going 
Down town the young ones are growing. 
We're the kids in America 
We're the kids in America 
Everbody lives for the music go round. 
Bright lights 
The music gets faster 
Look boy 
Don't check on your watch not another glanc@ 
I'm not leaving now 
Honey 
Not a chance. 
Hot shot give me no problems. 
Much later 
Baby 
You'll be saying never mind. 
You know life is cruel 
Life is never kind. 
Kind hearts don't make a new story 
Kind hearts don't grab any glory. 
We're the kids in America 
. . . 
Come closer 
Honey 
That's better 
Got to get a brand new experience feeling right. 
Oh 
Don't try to stop 
Baby 
Hold me tight. 
Outside a new day is dawning 
Outside surburbias sprawling everywhere. 
I don't want to go 
Baby 
New York to east California 
There's a newwave coming 
I warn you. 
We're the kids in America 
. . . 
We're the kids 
We're the kids 
We're the kids in America . . .
