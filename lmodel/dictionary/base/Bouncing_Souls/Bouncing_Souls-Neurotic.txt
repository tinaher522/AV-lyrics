<song artist="Bouncing_Souls" title="Neurotic">
Last night was bad my doubts were all
I really had realizing I was alone and
trying to think of someone to phone
but no one came to mind there was nothing
for me to say that just anyone would understand
I was scared and afraid I was
so alone we're neurotic we've had it!
surround myself with people but I'm
always alone human props small talk keeps
silence from imposing my own mind my
worst enemy it will destroy me slowly
more coffee more coffee more coffee I'm
going numb we're neurotic we've had it
it's hard for me to explain it's hard
to explain it's hard to understand
all the fear and phobia that lays inside
and traps this man when I'm surrounded I wanna
scream and kick down the walls
destroy what hold me I wanna smash it
all we're neurotic we've had it
