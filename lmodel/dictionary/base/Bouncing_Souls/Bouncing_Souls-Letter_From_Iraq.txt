<song artist="Bouncing_Souls" title="Letter_From_Iraq">
Hot Sunni sun passes moaning mosque spire
B-company's pinned down under heavy fire
Underneath the palms there's improvised bombs
Because Jihad Johnny knows Yankee is a liar
An eye for an eye and blood for Texas tea
At the call to prayer al-Qaeda's on its knees
Isaac versus Ishmael, Allah versus Christ
Zarqawi's on the offense picking up the beat
There's celebratory fire and a purple thumb vote
Tom Cruise is on the saudi from the Gulf love boat
Smart bombs are coming, see the children running
The dead, they are all laughing, but we don't get the joke
An eye for an eye and blood for Texas tea
At the call to prayer al-Qaeda's on its knees
Isaac versus Ishmael, Allah versus Christ
Zarqawi's on the offense picking up the beat
They lost another friend today
It's getting rough over there, they say the whole thing's fucked
I wish the boys were back, at least I know they're still alive
Another letter from Iraq
Presents full of Christmas loot
All that's left of Bullet Billy is a pair of bloody boots
His mom is on the phone, his girl is all alone
We all stand in the rain for a twenty-one gun salute
