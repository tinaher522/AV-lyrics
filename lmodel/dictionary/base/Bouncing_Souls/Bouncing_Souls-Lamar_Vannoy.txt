This is a song about a jerk friend of ours, his name is lammar vannoy!
Lamar vanoy!
He was only 16 and he knew he wasn't like anyone else
Listening to his records in his room he knew
something had to change somewhere or he would go insane
but when some years slipped by and he still felt the same.
people and money came and went but the only thing that stayed the same
were the feelings he felt when those records played
he drinks ‘til he falls down
Oi oi oi oi, his name is Lamar Vannoy!
Hes looking for something and
Hes gunna find it
Oi oi oi oi
And his name is lamar vannoy!
Me and Lamar in NYC on the avenue
talking about nothing much
with a bag of brew the New York wind
will blow and he will wears his engineer boots
motorcycle jacket black jeans nowhere to go
nothing to do 
so much has gone
wrong and so much is bad but sharing
this music with Lamar there is so
much we have 
he drink's and think's
about a girl who lies
oi oi oi oi and his name is Lamar Vannoy 
he'll wake up and
go to work with a swollen brain.
Oi oi oi oi
and his name is Lamar Vannoy 
once again thank you all for showing up at the continental in new york city, and if you don't do anything, then well at least have a good time
he drinks ‘til he falls down
Oi oi oi oi, his name is Lamar Vannoy!
Hes looking for something and
Hes gunna find it
Oi oi oi oi
And his name is lamar vannoy!
Ah-ha...
Ah-ha...
Hey man wouldnt you know it? we're redording this and I break a string on the third song 
Ay Pete sucks
