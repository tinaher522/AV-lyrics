<song artist="Bouncing_Souls" title="Sing_Along_Forever">
I'm driving, listening to my radio
Checking out the airwaves for something to believe in
Give me something to hold true
Give me something to sing about
Give me a reason to care
I'll sing along forever
Watered-down words covered in song
Trying to hide the truth
That life is beautiful
Or life is pain, give it to me straight
Touch my heart
I'll sing along forever
I'll sing along forever
I'll sing along forever
I'm driving, listening to my radio
Checking out the airwaves for something to believe in
Give me something to hold true
Give me something to sing about
Give me a reason to care
I'll sing along forever
Give it to me straight, touch my heart
I'll sing along forever
