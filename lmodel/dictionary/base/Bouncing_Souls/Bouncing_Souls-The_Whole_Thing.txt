<song artist="Bouncing_Souls" title="The_Whole_Thing">
Music sounds in my ear there are bricks for my view
I hear the train pass and im sure that i miss you
But i'll keep my head and i'll try and i know this will
pass by and by I made some coffeen and i overheard the
neighbors too sometimes they laugh sometimes they screw
it all reminds me of you But i don't worry anyway, after
all you are so far away Sometimes sadness feels happy
sometimes sadness keeps my head. Sometimes it helps me
to get by maybe i don't make no sense But i know this
will pass by and by Now i know i'm gonna try and i know
this will pass by and by
