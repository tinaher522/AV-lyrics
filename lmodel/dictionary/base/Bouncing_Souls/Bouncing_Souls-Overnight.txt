<song artist="Bouncing_Souls" title="Overnight">
We walk the house of life
See the things that we wanna see
Be what we wanna be
wherever I go I search for me
Now it's all we have
Now it's all we'll ever have
To live our life
Now is everything
And when I get inside my head
These are the new things that I find
There was so much I couldn't see
When I lived outside my mind
And I was everything I see
And everything I'll ever be
... will be
Now it's all we have
Now it's all we'll ever have
To live our life
Now is everything
Now is everything
Now is everything
Now is everything
Now is everything
