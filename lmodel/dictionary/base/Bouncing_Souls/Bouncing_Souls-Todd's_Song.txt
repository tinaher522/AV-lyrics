<song artist="Bouncing_Souls" title="Todd's_Song">
I grab into my sixpack and raise a can
to another fallen friend.
The news came on the phone today.
Did you know you weren't alone?
I'll see you when we all come home.
With a heart so big that you can't hide,
you took the path of a slow suicide.
And all those feelings that you had,
they killed you from the inside.
I'll see you when we all come home.
With a heart so big that you can't hide,
and all those things that you keep inside,
I can't say that I don't understand.
I know you tried.
I'll see you when we all come home.
