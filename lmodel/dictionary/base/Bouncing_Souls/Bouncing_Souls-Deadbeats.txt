<song artist="Bouncing_Souls" title="Deadbeats">
Deadbeats it isn't fair when I gotta to pay some else's share
Deadbeats you decide someone troubles you looking for another free ride
Deadbeats it's always the same I've got to play this game
What the hell is this man a phone bill
No way I'm going to pay for this shit
Fuck that man 300 dollars worth of phone sex calls
Who the hell made this man fuck
I got no money I can't pay this
Who's gonna pay for it
I can't be responsible for someone else's phone calls that I didn't make
Deadbeats it isn't fair when I gotta to pay some else's share
Deadbeats you decide someone troubles you looking for another free ride
Deadbeats it's always the same I've got to play this game
Ah shit fuck I don't care anymore
I'll pay the fucking phone bill
What do I gotta pay 50 dollars 60 dollars I don't care
I'm just not gonna get upset about this shit anymore
Money people I trusted my friends 
They think that they can 
They can just do anything money they just blow off
That's bullshit man I hate that
Deadbeats it isn't fair when I gotta to pay some else's share
Deadbeats you decide someone troubles you looking for another free ride
Deadbeats it's always the same I've got to play this game
So anyway you people may understand what a deadbeat is
And you might have seen one or two in your life
And you were really pissed of when you experienced a confrontational one
And you said I wish people would just do what they say
And I can trust them and everything will be ok
But no it doesn't happen like that
So I gotta keep my eyes open and I gotta watch out
Cause I like to trust people but sometimes things get messed up
Especially with money that's the worst I hate it
Deadbeats it isn't fair when I gotta to pay some else's share
Deadbeats you decide someone troubles you looking for another free ride
Deadbeats it's always the same I've got to play this game
