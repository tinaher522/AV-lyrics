<song artist="Bouncing_Souls" title="Some_Kind_Of_Wonderful">
Sometimes I think about girls and it's funny
it makes me stay inside when it's
sunny things are pathetic when I'm this way
assing the days and pining away
it's easy to see and it's easy to say
when I see people everyday but the days
go by and I think and try to conjure away
to find me a girl that makes the
problems go away passing the days and
pining away things are pathetic when I'm
this way and I can see that no one is perfect
why do I do this to myself
