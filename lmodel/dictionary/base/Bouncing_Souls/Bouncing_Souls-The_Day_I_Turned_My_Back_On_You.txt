<song artist="Bouncing_Souls" title="The_Day_I_Turned_My_Back_On_You">
I created this thing in my mind
Looking at it now, I don't see why
I threw away everything I had
And greener pastures is just a lie
I realize all these things now that it's too late
I guess that's part of the price I've got to pay
I betrayed myself when I betrayed you
I threw my life away
The day I turned my back on you
I turned and I ran away
I turned and ran away from the truth
The truth in everything
Everything we used to do
I never had reason to doubt you
I love everything about you
If I could just take it back, I would
I threw my life away
The day I turned my back on you
Believing my own lies
I lost myself and I lost everything
If I could just take it back, I would
I threw my life away
The day I turned my life on you
