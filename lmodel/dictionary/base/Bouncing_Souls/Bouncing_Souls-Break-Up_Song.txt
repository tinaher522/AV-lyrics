<song artist="Bouncing_Souls" title="Break-Up_Song">
"I don't want this anymore" is all I heard her say
As I grabbed my stuff and headed out the door
With my music in my phones and my bike under my feet
Things started to look different as I got out on the street
Sometimes I see her face
In the new people that I meet
We're not who we thought we were
When we saw this dream
Sometimes when I just can't sleep
I hear the words you said to me
How did you get so deep inside of me?
I wake up and I move on, admit the past is gone
I wake up and I refine
Moving forward to the next lifetime
I leave it all behind
Sometimes when I just can't sleep
I hear the words you said to me
Sometimes it takes a painful loss
To realize you are free
How did you get so deep inside of me?
How did you get so deep inside of me?
