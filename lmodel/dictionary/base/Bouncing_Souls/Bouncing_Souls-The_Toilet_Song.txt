<song artist="Bouncing_Souls" title="The_Toilet_Song">
Who's gonna throw the toilet, who's gonna throw the toilet off the roof?
We already smashed the TV with a guitar and a vacuum
Who's gonna throw the toilet, who's gonna throw the toilet off the roof?
Lighting fireworks, throwing bottles upstairs in the red room
Dave carried it up from the cellar
Bowl tank and all
Now we just have to take it on the roof
We can watch it fall
Who's gonna throw the toilet, who's gonna throw the toilet off the roof?
The landlord says you've got your your laws and I've got mine
Who's gonna throw the toilet, who's gonna throw the toilet off the roof?
Nobody's has anywhere to live, things are getting out of line
Who's gonna throw the toilet, who's gonna throw the toilet off the roof?
Who's gonna throw the toilet off the roof?
