<song artist="Bouncing_Souls" title="Big_Eyes">
You left home for the first time when you were seventeen
Searching for a life, beginning a new dream
You drove the car all night to learn your way around
Feeling so alone in the parking lot downtown
You had your love to give, so much life to live
Hey little girl, don't look so sad
It's not the end of the world, I've seen this film before
Already know the ending, some of the faces change
But the plot, it stays the same
Take my hand
Let's walk away
What did those big eyes see, a world where's nothing's free
Your innocent beauty slipping quietly
With every turn you found no one to understand
Why would you feel so down, no one to really see
What a woman you could be
Hey little girl, don't look so sad
It's not the end of the world, I've seen this film before
Already know the ending, some of the faces change
But the plot, it stays the same
You gave your heart
Every moment when no one can
They made you small
They couldn't make you fall
Hey, little girl
Hey, hey, little girl
Hey, little girl
Hey little girl, don't look so sad
It's not the end of the world, I've seen this film before
Already know the ending, some of the faces change
But the plot, it stays the same
So take my hand
Take my hand
So take my hand
Let's walk away
