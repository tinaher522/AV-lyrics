<song artist="Bouncing_Souls" title="Hopeless_Romantic">
I don't know what other people say
or what they think is love
but i know what it means to me
i fall in love so easily
and it's hard to let your guard down
something you never wanted to do
i give you my love and you turned away
i guess i'd be screwed
but
i'm a hopeless romantic
you're just hopeless
i'm a hopeless romantic
you're just hopeless
beer and wine does me fine
but it doesn't always do
when i get back up and dust off
i always come back to you
im my own man
with my own plan
i can't do the things you want me to 
im kinda lazy 
and i kinda stink
but ill clean myself up for you
i'm a hopeless romantic
you're just hopeless
i'm a hopeless romantic
you're just hopeless
you're just hopeless
you're just hopeless
