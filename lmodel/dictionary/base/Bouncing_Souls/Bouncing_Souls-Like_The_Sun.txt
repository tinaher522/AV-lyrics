<song artist="Bouncing_Souls" title="Like_The_Sun">
Drifting alone on a wide open sea
Letting life pass me by
Avoiding everything I'm afraid to be
But your heart shines a light
Lost in my own misery
'Til you came and helped me see
That I don't have to be alone
Thank you for giving this lost heart a home
So keep the light on
I'm coming home
'Cause I've been gone
For so long
Always lost inside
Always looking away
When the best moments in life
Are ours to take
The tragedy of human life
The darkness that lurks inside
The days that we quit and start to die
This is the time to stand and fight
So keep the light on
I'm coming home
'Cause I've been gone
For so long
Keep the light on
Yeah, I'm coming home
'Cause I've been gone
For so long
So shine on
Shine on
Shine on
Shine on
Drifting alone on a wide open sea
Letting life pass me by
Avoiding everything I'm afraid to be
But your heart shines a light
So keep the light on
I'm coming home
'Cause I've been gone
For so long
So keep the light on
I'm coming home
'Cause I've been gone
For so long
So shine on
Shine on
Shine on
Shine on
