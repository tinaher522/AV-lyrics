<song artist="Bouncing_Souls" title="Boogie_Woogie_Downtown">
How did it come to this?
Where did it all go wrong?
Nothing seems to be what it used to be
And no one's happy
I lie awake at night
This feeling just ain't right
These words go round and round and round in my head
Like a broken record
If this goes on much longer
I think I'm gonna explode
'Cause I don't want to wait until tomorrow
I want to have it out right now
Because if this thing is over, what's the point to drag it out?
Let's put it in the ground
This takes up all my time
I need to clear my mind
We don't see things eye to eye anymore
And it's just kind of beat
This is a tragedy
Like watching bad TV
This show plays on and on and on in my head
I can't change the channel
If this goes on much longer
I think I'm gonna explode
'Cause I don't want to wait until tomorrow
I want to have it out right now
Because if this thing is over, what's the point to drag it out?
Let's put it in the ground
Stop dragging it around
It's bringing me down
Boogie woogie downtown
If this goes on much longer
I think I'm gonna explode
'Cause I don't want to wait until tomorrow
I want to have it out right now
Because if this thing is over, what's the point to drag it out?
What's the point to drag it out?
Let's put it in the ground
