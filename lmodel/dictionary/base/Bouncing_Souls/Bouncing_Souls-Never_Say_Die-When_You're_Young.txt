<song artist="Bouncing_Souls" title="Never_Say_Die-When_You're_Young">
Never Say Die
Never say die
Never say die
We're the ones they couldn't keep in line
Living like we know there is no time
With a heart this world cannot deny
Never say die
Never say die
Never say die
All the emptiness we felt inside
All the ways they try to take your pride
All of this we will defy
Never say die
Never say die
Never say die
Looking back for one last time
At the world of lies we left behind
The time has come for us to rise
We're the ones they couldn't keep in line
Living like we know there is no time
With a heart this world cannot deny
Never say die
Never say die
Never say die
When You're Young
When you're young, write your songs
Take your time, stay strong
Hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on
Hold on, don't grow old
Hang onto your heart, stay close to your soul
Hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on
When you're young, write your songs
Take your time, stay strong
Hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on
Hold on, don't grow old
Hang onto your heart, stay close to your soul
Hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on
