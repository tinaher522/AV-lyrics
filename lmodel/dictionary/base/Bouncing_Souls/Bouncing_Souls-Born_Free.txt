<song artist="Bouncing_Souls" title="Born_Free">
Fear's in the air, that's the way they want it to be
Don't trust your friends and neighbors, everyone's your enemy
Kidnapped children on TV
Fear runs through the family
They'll put a chip in your arm
Keeping track of where you are
With all of this technology, have we come so far?
It's easy to get lost, forget who you are
Don't forget that you're born free
Better to die on your feet than to live on your knees
People are so greedy it's almost funny
How many ways can they ruin lives for money?
I see no choice but to enjoy the truth in life
In the middle of all this deceit and strife
A nation's future stands in doubt
Peace and love are on the way out
Why can't they just let me be?
How I live is up to me
Don't forget that you're born free
Better to die on your feet than to live on your knees
We get the message loud and clear 
We refuse to live in fear
We get the message loud and clear 
We refuse to live in fear
