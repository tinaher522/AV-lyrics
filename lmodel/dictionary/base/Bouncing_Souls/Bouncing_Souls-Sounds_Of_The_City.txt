<song artist="Bouncing_Souls" title="Sounds_Of_The_City">
The sounds of the city, somehow they comfort me
On lonely mornings like this
There's someone out there like me
Walking their own lonely street
The sounds of the city, somehow they comfort me
On lonely mornings like this
This emptiness inside, loneliness I feel
In this pain I'm not alone, in this city that is my home
One lonely heart reaching out to you
One strength to see us through
Alone together, this one goes out to you
We are not alone in this city that is our home
