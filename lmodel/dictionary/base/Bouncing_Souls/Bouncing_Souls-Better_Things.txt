<song artist="Bouncing_Souls" title="Better_Things">
Here's wishing you the bluest skies
And hoping something better comes tomorrow
Hoping all the verses rhyme
The very best of choruses to
Follow all that doubt and sadness
I know that better things are on the way
Here's hoping all the days ahead
Won't be as bitter as the ones behind you
Be an optimist instead
And somehow happiness will find you
Forget what happened yesterday
I know that better things are on the way
It's really good to see you rocking out and having fun
Living like you've just begun
Accept your life and what it brings
I hope tomorrow you find better things
I know tomorrow you'll find better things
Here's wishing you the bluest skies
And hoping something better comes tomorrow
Hoping all the verses rhyme
The very best of choruses to
Follow all the doubt and sadness
I know that better things are on their way
It's really good to see you rocking out and having fun
Living like you've just begun
Accept your life and what it brings
I hope tomorrow you find better things
I know tomorrow you'll find better things
I know tomorrow you'll find better things
Forget what happened yesterday
I know that better things are on their way
I know you got a lot of good things happening up ahead
The past is gone, it's all been said
So here's to what the future brings
I hope tomorrow you'll find better things
I hope tomorrow you'll find better things
I hope tomorrow you'll find better things
I hope tomorrow you'll find better things
I know tomorrow you'll find better things
