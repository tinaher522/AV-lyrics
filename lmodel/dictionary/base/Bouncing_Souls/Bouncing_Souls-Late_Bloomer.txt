<song artist="Bouncing_Souls" title="Late_Bloomer">
I saw you walking past me just the other day
Another heartbeat with thoughts of yesterday
You looked the same, years are only time
I still wonder why our hearts could never rhyme
You stood beside me, you didn't recognize me
Funny how some things never change
And when you walked on by a memory surprised me
Smoking cigarettes with your girlfriends by the pool
Your smell I could not forget, that's as close as I could get
You were so fucking cool
I'm no good, you're no better
Wouldn't we be perfect together?
I'm no good, you're no better
Wouldn't we be perfect together?
All I wanted was a piece of your heart
You left me torn apart
Fuck the rest before me and their crimes
For your love I'll serve their time
I'm no good, you're no better
Wouldn't we be perfect together?
I'm no good, you're no better
Wouldn't we be perfect together?
I'm no good, you're no better
Wouldn't we be perfect together?
