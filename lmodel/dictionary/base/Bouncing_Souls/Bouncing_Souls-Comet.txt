<song artist="Bouncing_Souls" title="Comet">
Storm is coming we feel fine
Comet's burning in the sky
VERSE:
Old world's burning in our minds
Watch it fall away and die
We begin to lose our minds as we open up our eyes
Chasing stars all through the sky
Comet's on it's way tonight setting all the world alight
CHORUS 1:
I can't wait to see what it's like [x2]
Stars look different tonight as the smoke begins to rise
It paints a coat of blue and white
Then dissipates in heaven's high
We're no longer asking why as we start to realize
Change, it's just a part of life
CHORUS 2:
I can't wait to see what it's like
To be weightless
Transformation
To be weightless
Transformation
BRIDGE:
All the seasons that we burned
All the things we never learned
Silence comes and goes again
Love eternal never ends
Storm is blowing, we feel fine
Comet's lighting up the night
[Verse]
[Chorus 2]
