<song artist="Bouncing_Souls" title="Simple_Man">
I see lives crash like waves on the shore again and again
In an endless cycle of join and pain 
Inside one day your whole life can change innocence torn away 
Trust gives way to a thicker pain 
A shield from pain? or a trap that keeps it all in. 
They tried to break me down - i had to break away
I woke up from that night mare to start another day
I wanna be a simple man with a little peace of mind 
Live a simple life, in a place thats kind 
I see lives crash like waves on the shore again and again. 
No poetry, No symmetry, nothing left inside of me 
What happened to that feeling of invincibility?
Broken up caught under the load 
Broken down by the side of the road 
They tried to break me down i had to break away 
I woke up from that nightmare to start another day....
