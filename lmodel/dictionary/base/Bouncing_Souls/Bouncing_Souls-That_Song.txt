<song artist="Bouncing_Souls" title="That_Song">
I put that record on just to make a sound
The rhythm hit, it got my movement off the ground
Soundtrack of what I want to be
If I want to change the world, it's gotta start with me
I put the needle on the record
I put the needle on the record and play that song again
I put the needle on the record
I put the needle on the record and play that song again
And in the end what have we learned?
Are we just faces in the crowd?
I died and was reborn again today
Hold fast to myself, make these good feelings stay
We laughed, we cried
The music shaped our lives
So tell me why our movement's out of time?
Are we so out of line?
I put the needle on the record
I put the needle on the record and play that song again
I put the needle on the record
I put the needle on the record and play that song again
A movement with no leaders
We stand tonight, hearts in our hands
