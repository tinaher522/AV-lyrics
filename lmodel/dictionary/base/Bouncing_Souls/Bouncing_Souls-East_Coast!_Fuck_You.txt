East coast!
Fuck you!
East coast!
Fuck you!
East coast!
Fuck you!
E!
A!
S!
T!
You may say we're weather martyrs
But snow and ice makes us rock harder
Punkers should be pale and pasty
The pizza here is fierce and tasty
East coast!
Fuck you!
East coast!
Fuck you!
East coast!
Fuck you!
NYC!
Boston!
DC!
Philly!
Jersey!
We go out west and play some shows
Then we know it's time to go
Pack the truck and drive on back
New York's better and that's a fact
East coast!
Fuck you!
East coast!
Fuck you!
East coast!
Fuck you!
