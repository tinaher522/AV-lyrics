<song artist="Bouncing_Souls" title="The_Fall_Song">
Leaves fall down around me.
They're smashing off my face
like orange and yellow lights.
I've entered a new place.
I've walked these streets 1,000 times before.
I never saw them this way.
A perfect end and a new beginning
every step of the way.
Colors seem so much more true.
My eyes must be on fire.
I feel each step's vibration
stab into my soul.
A tornado of light surrounds me;
picks me up off my feet.
The world is just a blink of light.
It can't hold me anymore...
