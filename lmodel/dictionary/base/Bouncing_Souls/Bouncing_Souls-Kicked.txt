<song artist="Bouncing_Souls" title="Kicked">
Kicked in the head and I'm falling on the floor I've got nothing so i'll dance some more Feeling allright it's good for now Feeling allright for now is good Kicked in the head I'm feeling like i've bled I've got nothing but i know what's said And that's good cuz now I know I'm not the only one now i know Kick in the head and i feel no pain I've got nothing and i feel insane This show took my last five That's o.k. cuz i feel alive Spine rattled sweat stinging my eyes and it's playing just right and i have no move Kicked in the head
