<song artist="Bouncing_Souls" title="Wish_Me_Well_(You_Can_Go_To_Hell)">
I've got to be me baby and you gotta be you
Something isn't right but I know, I love you
I only want what's best, I don't know Is this
Some kind of test, yeah and you're failing
All we do is bicker
Say goodbye, kiss my ass
I hope you die
Wish me well, you can go to hell
We were so different a short time ago
Love is suppose to make us happy supposed to make us grow
But I just wanna punch you in the face
I love you, I guess needed the space
Oh well another time and another place
Say goodbye, kiss my ass
I hope you die
Wish me well, you can go to hell
