<song artist="Bouncing_Souls" title="We_Love_Fun">
We love fun, we're going out and having some
We love fun, you know we're gonna have a ton
Put on your fun shoes
Fun just made the front page news
Put on your party pants
The time has come for us to make a stance
We love fun, we're going out and having some
We love fun 'cause being sad is really dumb
Na na na, na na na na na na na
Dilligaf 'cause we're having all the laughs
Na na na, na na na na na na na
Dilligaf 'cause we're having all the laughs
We love fun, we're going out and having some
We love fun, you know we're gonna have a ton
Put on your fun shoes
Walk away and throw away your blues
Put on your party pants
We're making music and we think you ought to dance
We love fun, there's more to life than what you see
We love fun, to have fun is to believe
