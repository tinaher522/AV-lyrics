<song artist="Bouncing_Souls" title="The_Guest">
Lost somewhere and trying to find a place to belong to
the empty alleys and parking lots is where I'll be 
when everyone goes home
I like what I see it's nothing special to me
and nothing's coming down on me 
I think of a place a time or a face 
staring out at the stars in the sky 
there's so many of them
and we're drivin' by
I like what I see it's nothing special to me
and nothing's coming down on me
