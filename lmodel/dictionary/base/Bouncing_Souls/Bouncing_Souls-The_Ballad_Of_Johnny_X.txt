<song artist="Bouncing_Souls" title="The_Ballad_Of_Johnny_X">
Johnny says he's bound by only six strings to this world
Johnny says he keeps them always one turn out of tune
Johnny never listens to the kids that say
Johnny X ain't never done the right thing anyway
Johnny wears his leather like a crown of thorns
Johnny spends alot of time wishing he was never born
Johnny waits at Journal Square and tells himself again
Johnny you're the patron saint of spittin' in the wind
Johnny's got all the right scars but he'll never learn from them
Johnny's past is his guide but he can't remember where he's been
Johnny looks up through the steam of his caffine and says
"Life a train I barely caught just to find out I ain't got the fare"
I got my records of The King to keep me 
the red red wine in the air is drifting 
four chords and the spite to use them 
and just enough wisdom to ignore the truth.
