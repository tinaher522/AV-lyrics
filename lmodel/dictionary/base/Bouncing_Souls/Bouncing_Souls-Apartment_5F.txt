<song artist="Bouncing_Souls" title="Apartment_5F">
Jackhammers outside my window
Woke me up again today
And all the voices in my head
But it's so hard to make them go away
Staying out all night
Looking for something I'll never find
I'm fighting with myself
And I'm losing control of my mind
I reached out in anger
I reached out in love
I lived a life of self-abuse
I prayed to the heavens above
Jackhammers outside my window
Woke me up again today
And all the voices in my head
Well, it's so hard to make them go away
Looking for some new stimulation
But all of these things just never last
I know I have to move forward
But I keep holding onto the past
I just want to be happy
With the way things are
I just want to look up at the sky at night
And appreciate the stars
Destruction leaves an empty space
In emptiness again I begin to create
Feeling good again now, in some new kind of way
Feeling good again now
