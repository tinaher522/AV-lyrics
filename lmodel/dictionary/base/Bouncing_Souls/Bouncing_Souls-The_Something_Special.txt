<song artist="Bouncing_Souls" title="The_Something_Special">
We can't agree on a single thing, I don't know why
We almost killed each other on the inside
I managed to be a jerk anyway
It doesn't have to be this way
Forget about the things I said
I make no excuse for them
I want to start again
I want to start again
We all walk our separate ways, I don't know why
I hope we meet again somewhere some day
I can't change the way you feel
It doesn't have to be this way
Forget about the things I said
I make no excuse for them
I want to start again
I want to start again
I think about the two of us, I don't know why
I feel good on the inside
It's different now, I'm one, I stand alone
I have to be this way, I have to be this way
Forget about the things I said
I make no excuse for them
I want to start again
I want to start again
I want to start again
I want to start again
Forget about the things I said
Forget about the things I said
Forget about the things I said
Forget about, forget about, forget about
