<song artist="Bouncing_Souls" title="Better_Life">
Wait for the morning light to sneak up with the sunrise
Last night was so long ago, where did the hours go?
I saw the first daylight shining in your eyes
You were mine and the world was ours
Dreams of a better life can come true
It's all there in you
Just like a break in the clouds when the sun comes shining through
Momentary glimpse of the divine sometimes when I look at you
And everything just cancels out
And for that moment there's no doubt
Dreams of a better life can come true
It's all there in you
Sometimes a new day can bring a new beginning
You took me to a place no time can erase
Yesterday I was a loser, today I'm winning
Today you're mine and the world is ours
Dreams of a better life can come true
It's all there in you
Dreams of a better life can come true
It's all there in you
