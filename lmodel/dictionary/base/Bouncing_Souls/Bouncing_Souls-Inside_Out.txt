<song artist="Bouncing_Souls" title="Inside_Out">
It's incredible how we try to be a part of something
It's amazing how we feel alone when we're never separate
It's so funny how we weave a web of our own destruction
Then we find in the end we fought so hard to be a part of something
To feel someone beside you is beautiful in life
But to feel a wholeness inside is the greatest feeling
There is nothing that can take that away
We're never alone
To feel someone beside you is beautiful in life 
But to feel a wholeness inside is the greatest feeling of all
