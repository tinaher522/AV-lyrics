<song artist="Bouncing_Souls" title="For_All_The_Unheard">
A guitar collects dust like his heart, soundless and still
A girl collapses on her bed, writing words never read
Troubled youth spills over into troubled life and times
We walk along with our troubled minds
A guitar strikes a chord, hits a misery so hard, so bold
Sounding through this world where it's so hard to feel that gold
It's running through a song of beauty buried deep under a river of greed
Where the muddy waters flow and the stones don't roll
This is for all the unheard, all the music left behind
All the songs left on the floor in the closets of our minds
Where's the passion gone in our hearts, lost somewhere in the grind?
It's time to bring it back, it's time to unwind, find what we lost, it's time
It's time to bring it back
A lost song lingers on
Bouncing off stars on and on
A moment gone, or is it looking for you
To sing its tune?
Troubled youth spills over into troubled life and times
We walk alone with our troubled minds
This is for all the unheard, all the music left behind
All the songs left on the floor in the closets of our minds
Where's the passion gone in our hearts, lost somewhere in the grind?
It's time to bring it back, it's time to unwind, find what we lost, it's time
It's time to bring it back
It's time to bring it back
It's time to bring it back
It's time to bring it back
It's time to bring it back
