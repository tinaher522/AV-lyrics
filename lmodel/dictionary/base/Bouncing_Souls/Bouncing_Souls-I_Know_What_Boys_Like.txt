I know what boys like
I know what guys want
I know what boys like
I've got what boys like
I know what boys like
I know what guys want
I see them looking
I make them want me
I like to tease them
They want to touch me
I never let them
I know what boys like
I know what guys want
I know what boys like
Boys like (clap)
Boys like me
but you, you're special
(i might let you)
You're so much diffrent
(i might let you)
ohh, would you like that
(i might let you)
I know what boys like
I know what guys want
I know what boys like
I know whats on there mind
I know what boys like
I know what guys want
They talk about me

I got my cat moves
That so upsets them
Zippers and buttons
Fun to frustrate them
They get so angry
Like pouty children
Denied their candy
I laugh right at them

i know what boys like
i know what guys want
i know what boys like,
boys like (clap)
boys like me
I feel so sad now
i will let you
sorry i teased you
i will let you
this time i mean it
i will let you
anything you want
you can trust me
i really want to
you can trust me
how would you like it?
you can trust me
Sucker! hahaha
I know what boys like
I know what guys want
i know what boys like
Boys like (clap)
Boys like me
