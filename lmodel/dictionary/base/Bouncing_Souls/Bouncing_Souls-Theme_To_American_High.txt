<song artist="Bouncing_Souls" title="Theme_To_American_High">
We walk the halls of life
See the things what we wanna see
Be what we wanna be
Wherever I go I search for me
Now it's all we have
Now it's all we'll ever have
To live our lives
Now it's Everything
And when i get inside my head
These are the new things that i find
That was so much i couldn't see
when i live outside my mind
And i love everythings i see
And everythings i'll never be
will be
Now it's all we have
Now it's all we'll ever have
To live our lives
Now it's Everything
Now it's Everything
Now it's Everything
Now it's Everything
Now it's Everything!!!
