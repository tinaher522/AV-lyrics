<song artist="Bouncing_Souls" title="Static">
Do you hear the voice on the radio
Screaming noise, noise, noise?
Telling us what we need
Have we lost our choice?
The static fuzz from talking heads
Across airwaves for walking dead
Over saturation
So much emptiness,
So much emptiness
Do you hear the voice on the radio
Screaming noise, noise, noise?
Selling us all their greed
Have we lost our voice?
There is no poetry
No stories to be told
No more songs
Just noise, noise, noise
Noise, noise, noise
Do you hear the voice on the radio?
Go to sleep, go to sleep,
Go to sleep, children
Make believe, Just a dream
Make believe, children
You're in your deepest sleep,
In your darkest dream,
It's all around you now
Getting the urge to destroy
When all I see is static
Getting the urge to destroy
Sleep walking addicts,
Sleep walking addicts
Do you hear the voice on the radio?
Do you hear the voice on the radio?
Do you hear the voice on the radio?
Do you hear the voice on the radio?
