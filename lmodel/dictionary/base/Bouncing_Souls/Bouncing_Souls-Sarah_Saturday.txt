<song artist="Bouncing_Souls" title="Sarah_Saturday">
Midnight and the sound of rain
Sarah's on her way again
I see her smile and close her eyes
Shutting off the world outside
3rd Avenue rumbles all around her
So unaffected by the chaos that surrounds her
Writing words to the music in her head
It's a perfect song moving her along
Through a broken world that changes every day
But inside Sarah's head everything's okay
Sarah Saturday, you radiate
And nothing in this world is wrong
Sarah Saturday, like a perfect song
Makes me want to sing along
Burning down the world of lies
With just one glance from those clear blue eyes
Holding onto the truth
With some quiet strength inside
She gives me hope for better times
Thank you, Sarah, for showing me
The strength to free my mind
Rise above these troubled times
Writing words to the music in my head
It's a perfect song moving me along
In a broken world that changes every day
You make me feel like everything's okay
Sarah Saturday, you radiate
And nothing in this world is wrong
Sarah Saturday, like a perfect song
Makes me want to sing along
