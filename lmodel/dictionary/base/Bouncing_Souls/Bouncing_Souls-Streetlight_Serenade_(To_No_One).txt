<song artist="Bouncing_Souls" title="Streetlight_Serenade_(To_No_One)">
I'll sing this song to my bike and everything else that I like
this goes out to my handlbars
As I'm weaving through the cars.
This is for my squirrels in the park and every dog that doesn't bark.
This is a song about a ride and listening to whats inside,
I look at all the cars I pass
I cruise myself in the glass
