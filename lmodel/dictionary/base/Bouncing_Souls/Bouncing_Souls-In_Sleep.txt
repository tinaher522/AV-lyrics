<song artist="Bouncing_Souls" title="In_Sleep">
In sleep, sweet escape
Riding through New Mexico in June
Left alone with my thoughts
Underneath the pale blue moon
In sleep, sweet escape
Alone out on a beach
The sky is on fire, I walk to the sea
Her soft breath comforts me
CHORUS:
My heart is free and I drift away, drift away [x2]
In sleep, sweet escape
Riding under the desert sun
With your arms around my sides
In a never ending run
In sleep, sweet escape
I float above myself
And I see the world we made in a warmer light
[Chorus]
BRIDGE:
I know it's gonna be all right when I see you
When I see you in my dreams tonight
And I know you're gonna be all mine when I see you
When I see you in my dreams tonight
[Chorus]
