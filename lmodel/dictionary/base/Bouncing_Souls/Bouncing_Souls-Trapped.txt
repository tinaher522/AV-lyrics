<song artist="Bouncing_Souls" title="Trapped">
If i say no i'll be free but all alone When i say yes i'll be trapped but i'll have some one I'm inside out cuz I don't know Decide before i arrive Yes or no if I say yes i'll be trapped When im trapped i'll have some one What's it like to be alone I don't know I'll never know If i say yes yes i'll be trapped When i'm trapped i'll have some one I'll have to decide before i arrive I'll have to decide yes or no When i'm free
