<song artist="Bouncing_Souls" title="I_Started_Drinking_Again">
Since I started drinkin' again
Since I started drinkin' again 
I ain't shed one lousy tear over you 
Since I started drinkin' again 
I know that the neighbors are all a-talkin' 
They swear that I have lost my mind 
Ah, but they do not know 
That I've just gained control 
Of all the heartache that you left behind 
[Chorus:]
Since I started drinkin' again 
Since I started drinkin' again 
I ain't shed one lousy tear over you 
Since I started drinkin' again 
Well I know that the boss is gonna fire me 
When I stumble in late to work again 
But surprise will replace that old scowl on his face 
When he sees that I do not give a damn 
[Chorus:]
Since I started drinkin' again 
Since I started drinkin' again 
I ain't shed one lousy tear over you 
Since I started drinkin' again 
I ain't shed one lousy tear over you 
Since I started drinkin' 
Since I started drinkin' 
Since I started drinkin' again
