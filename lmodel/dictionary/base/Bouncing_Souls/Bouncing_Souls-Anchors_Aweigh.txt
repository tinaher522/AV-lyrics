<song artist="Bouncing_Souls" title="Anchors_Aweigh">
Anchors aweigh, my friends
I'll see you another day
I'm going away
Experiences have to come
And the past has got to go
Back into our dreams
Back into our dreams
Anchors aweigh, my friends
Everybody understands
That good times
That good times come and they go
And together we will always go
Back into our dreams
Back into our dreams
And our troubles, we can't leave them behind
But the wind blows and blows them all away
And the road goes and takes them all away
Back into our dreams
