<song artist="Bouncing_Souls" title="You're_So_Rad">
You're so rad than my dad 
if you were a fabric you'd be plaid
Everybody knows plaid is so rad 
I think about you and I go mad
You're so rad you really spark 
my nads some say you're good
but I know you're bad 
if you go i'll be sad 
stop the presses run an ad 
if there were three 
og you you'd be a rad triad
You're so rad
