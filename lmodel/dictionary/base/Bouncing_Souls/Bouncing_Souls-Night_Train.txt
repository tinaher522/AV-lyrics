<song artist="Bouncing_Souls" title="Night_Train">
Goodbye to me and you, goodbye to the life we knew
One last long embrace, then go and walk on through
I'm leaving everything behind for a peace that I can't find
Ghosts that roam this house, winter air right through our souls
And it feels like dying
It just feels like time to go
Going down south to dream another dream
Maybe check out Memphis, Tennessee
Take the night train with an extra pair of jeans
Can't think of anything else I really need
All my experiences ride with me
This town is dead to me and
I can't stop chasing my dreams
I love you more than anything
But what you want I can never be
I love you more than anything
But I'll be alone, can't we both be free?
Goodbye to me and you
Goodbye to the life we knew
Wipe the tears from your eyes
Then go and walk on through
