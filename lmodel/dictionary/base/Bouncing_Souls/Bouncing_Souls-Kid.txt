<song artist="Bouncing_Souls" title="Kid">
You're a good kid
Play the game to break your heart
You've gotta get back to where you started
Pay attention now or it'll slip by
It's your heart, don't let it die
Leave it all behind
Whoooaaaa (catchy line)
Is it true when we get old our hearts die?
I heard it in a movie once, and I think I know why
Life, it sucks so bad it makes you wanna die
Whoooaaa but you get by
Life goes by (3x)
You're a good kid
You still got the fire in you
Hangin' around, you don't know what to do
Don't think too much, just let it loose
Get up, now's your chance
We are here and we make you dance
You are not alone
This is our home
Life goes by (3x)
