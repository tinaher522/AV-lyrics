<song artist="Bouncing_Souls" title="Better_Days">
What do you do when she don't love you anymore?
What do you do when she wont hold you anymore?
Living in sin, now you're all alone again. 
She's having a change of heart 
without a word everything just falls apart 
What do you do when she don't love you anymore?
What do you do when she wont hold you anymore?
Two lovers walking through life together 
Tender kisses and all the sweet things they used to say 
Memories from better days
Everything we built 
Everything that i believed in... 
Just some old fashioned fantasy.
