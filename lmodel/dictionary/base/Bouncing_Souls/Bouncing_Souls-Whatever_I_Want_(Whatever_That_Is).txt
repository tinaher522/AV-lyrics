<song artist="Bouncing_Souls" title="Whatever_I_Want_(Whatever_That_Is)">
Pride's a lot to swallow
When you've been beaten down to the ground
You'll be back in a flash, this won't be the last
You'll find what there is to be found
Anyway, that's what they say
I don't know what I'm supposed to be in
You've gotta be in it to win it
When it's your last chance sin
There are people with stuff and some without
But in the end, what does it mean to win?
Okay, so I'm here, I'm making the best of it
There's no such thing as a sin
I guess I'll do whatever I want
Whatever that is, then I know I'll win
You've gotta be in it to win it
When it's your last chance sin
