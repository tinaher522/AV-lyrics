<song artist="Bouncing_Souls" title="Wig">
We waited waited and waited We worked worked worked and got jerked The things we hared we hated hated and hated People faded and faded they faded Faded from our sight It's plain to see it's not me you see I won't play with you not me We got burned and learned not to be I guess so free Maybe now we can see ourselves and everything clearer
