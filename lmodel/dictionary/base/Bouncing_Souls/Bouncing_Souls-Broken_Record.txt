<song artist="Bouncing_Souls" title="Broken_Record">
Going to the same old places, skipping like a broken record
I love you all, but I gotta get out and change this scenery
I've got to find what I'm living for
I've got to change this life that I'm living
Nowhere to run from myself
Nowhere to hide from the truth
I tried to find someone, someone who knew
Somebody to give myself to
I learned the hard way, when you give yourself away
You give away your life too
Nowhere to run from myself
Nowhere to hide from the truth
I tried to find someplace that seemed right for me
I walked the streets until I lost my mind
And that was the best place to be
When I lost my mind the truth set me free
