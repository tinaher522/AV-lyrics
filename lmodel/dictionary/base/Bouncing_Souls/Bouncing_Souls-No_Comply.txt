<song artist="Bouncing_Souls" title="No_Comply">
I'm on the outside looking in
That's where my story begins
Took the pain of growing up and I walked on through
This time I'm showing up, I feel great, how about you?
So here I stand out on my own
Myself, the only truth that I've known
I went through all the things that I had to do
You know sometimes it stings, but I feel great, how about you?
Playing life just like a game
Good or bad, it's all the same
Let the world know how I feel
And you know it's real, and you know it's real
