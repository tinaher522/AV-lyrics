<song artist="Bouncing_Souls" title="Single_Successful_Guy">
I'm beating down doors, stumbling down the street
Dialing the telephone
Up all night, up all morning
Right here is my home
But I know I don't even have to try
I'm a single successful guy
Lonely with my friends
And lonely with my favorite girl
Lonely when I'm all alone
If you're gonna talk, I gotta listen
Because right here is my home
It's easy, I don't have to try
I'm a single successful guy
My ears are ringing loud
But I can't hear a sound
I'm carrying all I own
And my heart is heavy in my chest
Right here is my home
It's easy, I don't have to try
I'm a single successful guy
Single successful guy
