<song artist="Bouncing_Souls" title="The_Pizza_Song">
On a dark street, on a cold night
Pizza's cooking in a storefront oven
On the corner a boy is waiting
The moonlight feels cold and desperate
Some hidden sadness is bound down
Attention lives all over town
Ready to burst open into driving
Burning, exploding sound
If these walls could sing
They'd sing us a hundred songs
If these walls could talk
They'd say they've seen it coming all along
Tony's making slice pies for the lunch rush
Stirring the sauce, pounding out the dough
His brother left town with his girl
She ain't his girl no more
And some days, they seem to never end
So mundane in this old town
Ready to burst open into driving
Burning, exploding sound
If these walls could sing
They'd sing us a hundred songs
If these walls could talk
They'd say they've seen it coming all along
May all these walls we've made
In our wasted years and days
Not stand in our way
That we may feel the winds of change
If these walls could sing
They'd sing us a hundred songs
If these walls could talk
They'd say they've seen it coming all along
If these walls could sing
They'd sing us a hundred songs
If these walls could talk
They'd say they've seen it coming, coming, coming, coming, coming all along
