<song artist="Bouncing_Souls" title="Ecfu!">
East coast! F*** you!
East coast! F*** you!
East coast! F*** you!
E! a! s! t!
You can say we're weather martyr's,
But snow and ice makes us rock harder
Punkers should be pale and pasty
The pizza here is fierce and tasty
East coast! F*** you!
East coast! F*** you!
East coast! F*** you!
NYC! Boston! (D-C!) Philly! Jersey!
We go out west and play some shows
Then we know it's time to go
Pack the truck and drive on back
New York's better and that's a fact
East coast! F*** you!
East coast! F*** you!
East coast! F*** you!
