<song artist="Bouncing_Souls" title="Low_Life">
Last week your pockets were fat
Spending on this and buying that
The week is over and I'm not so flush
I'd save money if I wasn't a lush
You didn't plan to fail
You just failed to plan
I'm living the lowlife again
Last week it was pints of Guinness
Now I'm drinking quarts of piss
End of the month, you've got no money
Kill my landlord, ain't that funny?
You didn't plan to fail
You just failed to plan
I'm living the lowlife again
So this ain't your finest hour
I found some cereal but the milk is sour
Things look bad but this isn't the end
Someday I'll be living large again
You didn't plan to fail
You just failed to plan
I'm living the lowlife again
Lowlife
