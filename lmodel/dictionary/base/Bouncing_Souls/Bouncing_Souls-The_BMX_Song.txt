If i had money i'd buy a new BMX
it's a long walk through the city in the rain
it's along walk from train to train.
If i had money i'd buy a new BMX 
(but I don't know how I'm gonna eat next... oh I heard that, man)
We'll build a jump and do some tricks (YEAH!)
and maybe we'll impress some chicks (ALRIGHT! I'm with that)
then we'll put on some really cool, dark shades and, (uh huh?)
we'll run over all the dorks with rollerblades... (YEAH! ah yeah)
If i had money i'd buy a new BMX
crossups, tabletops, endos, curb endos,
timmy judge! yeah, all right... get rad!
if i had money i'd buy a new BMX
