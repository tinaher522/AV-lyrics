<song artist="Bouncing_Souls" title="Private_Radio">
Well, I like to rock and I love to roll
When the music's running through my soul
I got no, no place to go
But my own private radio
I met a lot of people that made me feel alright
And the music's got me through the night
Well, I had a drink and I had a smoke
I listened to every word you spoke
Another story, another memory
Another day the way things should be
If I had it my way, everyone would know
How we're living in our, our own private radio
Private radio, private radio
Private radio, private radio
Private radio, private radio
Private radio, private radio
If I had it my way, everyone would know
How we're living in our, our own private radio
Private radio, private radio
Private radio, private radio
Private radio, private radio
Private radio, private radio
