<song artist="Bouncing_Souls" title="The_Messenger">
This is a message to you
a message to you
[Chorus]
I am a messenger
I'm passing a message to you
a messenger
I'm passing along words in a song
Yeah
Yeah
I was lost I was like tv
a dead end road with no meaning
love to be a kid with no worries
it seems so hard
oh it seems so hard
so hard to be free
I am a messenger
I'm passing a message to you
a messenger
I'm passing along words in a song
Yeah
Yeah
I see people looking just like me
wandering on a dead end street
somewhere somehow we lost a key
to another place
away from this rat race
let the music play
let the music play
it'll take your breath away
Whoahh
Whoahh
let all the people hear it
let all the people feel it
let all the people hear it
raise your voice (whoooahh)
it's your choice
raise your voice (whoooahh)
it's your choice
I am a messenger
I'm passing a message to you
a messenger
passing by this night
a messenger
I'm passing along words in a song
Yeah
Yeah
this is a message to you
do what you love
love what you do
this is a message to you
do what you love
this is a message to you
what you love
what you love
what you love
