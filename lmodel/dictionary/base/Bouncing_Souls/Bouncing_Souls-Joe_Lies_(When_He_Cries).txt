<song artist="Bouncing_Souls" title="Joe_Lies_(When_He_Cries)">
I see it on the street in people passing by
everybody's got someplace to be
and I'm not sure why I don't care to see
them try to hide their lies you see
it's plain to me I think it's deep inside
everything is holding me from this
truth and I find it's so rare to see
people speak so honestly but everyday I
try I'm gonna try problems are apparently
what makes me try on and on and it's
hard to see why the struggle around
its what brings me down on and on
endlessly everyday I try all these jobs
and these words are nothing without honesty
people say if they don't care then why
should I care I say I don't care then
why should anyone care so everyday I
try to deal with these lies no more lies
