<song artist="Bouncing_Souls" title="It's_Not_The_Heat,_It's_The_Humanity">
It's hot It's a four-alarm fricasee boy this heat is
killing me it's hot it's hot tonight It's duelling 
dicks in a deep-fry It's hot standing next to these
other guys it's hot It's sweaty snapper in a stir-fry
A blazing sun under a red sky It's hot It's hot It's 
sexy and it's wet and the show ain't even over yet
How much better can get tonight It's so hot i can't
even think I need some air I need a drink Sweaty
bodies everywhere down to their underwear tonight!
My balls are sticking to my leg Pass the 40; 
sippin' dregs Raise the roof let's set it off
Cuz we just can get enough tonight!
