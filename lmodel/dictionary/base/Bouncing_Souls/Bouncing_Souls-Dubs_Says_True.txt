<song artist="Bouncing_Souls" title="Dubs_Says_True">
Hello again, my good friend
You have been there through it all
A strange face in the dark
Do you know what you've done at all?
You say we have been there for you
In all the tough times of your life
Remember you have been there too
The greatest friends I've ever seen, know what I mean
We always will be true
We always will be true
Incredible stories we have heard
Over the years at all the shows
She changed her life, he met his wife
Beautiful how it all goes
You say we have been there for you
In all the good times of your life
Remember you have been there too
The greatest friends I've ever seen, know what I mean
We always will be true
We always will be true
Never say goodbye to a friend
True 'til the end
Never say goodbye to a friend
True 'til the end
Thank you, my friend, once again
For reminding me that this should never end
You've inspired me again, know what I mean
We always will be true
We always will be true
We always will be true
We always will be true
