<song artist="Bouncing_Souls" title="Cracked">
I'm gonna crack one day
I'll just leave and go my way
They might say I quit
Ask me if I give a shit
I'll put it out and place one bet
The day I crack I won't regret
I know it's time to be a man
And deal with things the best I can
In fact, I'm only seeing read every time I turn my head
Empty vessels staring back
Life is getting to me lately as you can clearly see
And I don't think I stand a chance
No place I can go to leave this behind
This fucked up world is all inside my mind
This is how it had to be
Something's changed inside of me
No place I can go to leave this behind
This fucked up world is all inside my mind
This is how it had to be
Something's changed inside of me
I always want to run and hide
Dig a hole and crawl inside
It's not that I'm feeling blue
I'm sure you've got your problems too
I'm not a jerk, I'm not a dick
Maybe just a little sick
One of these days I'm gonna snap
Then you'll know that I'm cracked
In fact, I'm only seeing read every time I turn my head
Empty vessels staring back
Life is getting to me lately as you can clearly see
And I don't think I stand a chance
No place I can go to leave this behind
This fucked up world is all inside my mind
This is how it had to be
Something's changed inside of me
No place I can go to leave this behind
This fucked up world is all inside my mind
This is how it had to be
Something's changed inside of me
