<song artist="Bouncing_Souls" title="Airport_Security">
Here we go again
On our way to some airport
Check lady smiles at me
Then she asks for my photo ID
I'm a frequent flier, elite gold member
In the endless blue
We're flying so fast but time's moving so slow
You know I'm thinking of you
I could write a thousand songs and never get it right
In my mind, it's getting harder to leave you
You know I have to believe you're alright
What else can I do while I'm flying so high?
Muzak is playing again
They saw my soul in the security line
They said it has no end
With you and I in our forever in time
But it feels like you're slipping away somehow
It has to be that way
Who I thought you were, who I thought I was
Is finally dying away
Into the souls of a thousand songs I will write someday
In my mind, it's getting harder to leave you
You know I have to believe you're alright
What else can I do while I'm flying so high?
Ali Hasan is on the no-fly list
He's getting hassled by the FBI
In my mind, it's getting harder to leave you
You know I have to believe you're alright
What else can I do while I'm flying so high?
In my mind, it's getting harder to leave you
You know I have to believe
You know I have to believe
You know I have to believe
