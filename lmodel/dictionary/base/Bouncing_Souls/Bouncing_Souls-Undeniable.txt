<song artist="Bouncing_Souls" title="Undeniable">
The one minute I saw you
I remember your red shoes
I keep this little memory of you
I see you in my mind
When I need to
Thank you for your red shoes
Some say the world isn't fair
At least for one moment I didn't care
It's all in how I see it and what I choose
Nothing seems black
When I see your red shoes
Thank you for your red shoes
That minute I saw you
I remember you and your red shoes
Now I have this memory of you
I see it in my mind
When I need too
Thank you for your red shoes
