<song artist="Bouncing_Souls" title="Serenity">
I spent some time
Saying some things I didn't want to say
Convincing someone of something about me
Not a lie, but not the truth in a way
Slipping into a suit and tie
Or walking in some shoes
I got lost in that disguise
I guess I had something to prove
But the proof is there in what I do
Talk is cheap and clothes make the man
If it's not a disguise and
You know where you stand
I'm a clown, I'm a monkey, maybe I'm a jerk
Whatever you make me out to be
But I know the difference
And what you say doesn't matter to me
I don't care what you think
I'm gonna do what I have to do
Say what you want to say
Talk's a waste of time with you
I don't care what you think
I'm gonna do what I have to do
So say what you want to say
Talk's a waste of time with you
I don't care what you think
I'm gonna do what I have to do
So say what you want to say
Talk's a waste of time with you
