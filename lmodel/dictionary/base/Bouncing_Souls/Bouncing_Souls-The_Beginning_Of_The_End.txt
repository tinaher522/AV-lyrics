<song artist="Bouncing_Souls" title="The_Beginning_Of_The_End">
They try to tell me the lies they sell me
They tell me that I'm wrong
They try to will me they'll never kill me
Cause I'm the chosen one
This is the beginning the beginning of the end
Better watch out better find yourself a friend
They try to tie me they say they'll free me
You try to tell them they're wrong
They want to hold me and they want to sock me
They'll never convince me they're right
This is the beginning the beginning of the end
Violence they say is this year's big trend
Oh the night has just begun
And the cool boys get some fun
They try to fool me it's your lies that cool me
I see through their game
They boys are out running look out they're coming
Cause they don't feel the same
This is the beginning the beginning of the end
Better watch out better find yourself a friend
They couldn't beat me they couldn't cheat me
I knew I'd always win
Will I have a witness to end their scene
The Beginning of the end
This is the beginning the beginning of the end
Violence they say is this year's big trend
Oh the night has just begun
And the cool boys get some fun
