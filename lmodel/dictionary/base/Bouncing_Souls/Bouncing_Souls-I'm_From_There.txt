<song artist="Bouncing_Souls" title="I'm_From_There">
When we were two brothers forever through the dark and light
We had our fights against the world, against each other
We traveled in the night
So many roads, so many shows together
Far apart we grew, isolated but still together
When we were two brothers forever through the dark and light
We had our fights against ourselves, against each other
We were afraid, afraid of so many things
It was a fight to overcome ourselves and see clearer
We are two brothers forever through the dark and light
We had our fights against the world, against each other
Time has opened my heart 
I don't want to hold on to that past
I don't want to live in isolation anymore
There's nothing left to do, but to kiss that life goodbye
Goodbye...
Goodbye...
Goodbye...
We are two brothers forever through the dark and light
We had our fights against ourselves, against each other
There's nothing left to do, but to kiss that life goodbye
Goodbye...
Goodbye...
