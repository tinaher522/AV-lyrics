<song artist="Bouncing_Souls" title="No_Rules">
You gotta do what you gotta do
sometimes you eat what's in front of you.
Yeah so we'll drink a beer or two
it's not what you say it's what you do
no rules it's not what you say
it's what you do. Were not "nailed to the
X" or swill in the gutter we just follow
our hearts from one moment to
another punk is this and punk is that words
are lame and words are crap
inhibitions repressed and correct,
vegan reich? what the heck! no rules!
it's not what you say it's what you do.
