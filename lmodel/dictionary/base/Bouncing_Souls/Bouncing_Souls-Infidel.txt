<song artist="Bouncing_Souls" title="Infidel">
We're under a new moon
Daylight always comes too soon
Party like an infidel
Dancing our way straight to hell
We're doing well living here in hell
Judge us any time, we don't mind
We're doing well living here in hell
Judge us any time, we don't mind
Judgment day comes at hard noon
For everybody in the room
Saints or sinners, who can tell?
Going down right where we fell
We're doing well living here in hell
Judge us any time, we don't mind
We're doing well living here in hell
Judge us any time, we don't mind
Yeah
We're doing well living here in hell
Judge us any time, we don't mind
We're doing well living here in hell
Judge us any time, we don't mind
