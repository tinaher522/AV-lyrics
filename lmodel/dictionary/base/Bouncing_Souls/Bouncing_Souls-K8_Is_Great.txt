<song artist="Bouncing_Souls" title="K8_Is_Great">
I used to have a home with a room and a bed
A porch and a driveway with a big garage
But I traded it in, I kept some faith
And laid my head down every night
And it seems so far away
It seems so far away
Remember me now, 'cause things always change
Five long years have gone
I've done some time sleeping where I fall
I know I'll never be the same
Remember me now, 'cause things always change
Five long years have gone
I've done some time sleeping where I fall
I know I'll never be the same
I learned some things about the places I saw
I learned some things about myself
I guess it came the hard way, now I know what counts
I've got one prayer, it's in your confidence
I know all the places I don't want to be
Everyone's gone, there's no one, just me
Remember me now, 'cause things always change
Five long years have gone
I've done some time sleeping where I fall
I know I'll never be the same
Remember me now, 'cause things always change
Five long years have gone
I've done some time sleeping where I fall
I know I'll never be the same
Remember me next time I go away
For the first time in my life, I want to stay
I can count on one hand here today
The only thing that matters to me anyway
And it seems so far away
It seems so far away
Remember me now, 'cause things always change
Five long years have gone
I've done some time sleeping where I fall
I know I'll never be the same
Remember me now, 'cause things always change
Five long years have gone
I've done some time sleeping where I fall
I know I'll never be the same
