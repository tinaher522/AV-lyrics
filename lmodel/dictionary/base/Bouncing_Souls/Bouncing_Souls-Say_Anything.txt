<song artist="Bouncing_Souls" title="Say_Anything">
I wanna make you know I can do everything
But I don't ever show you how I really am
I wish I could say I have no regrets
I wanted too much from you
I don't want to be this way
I kick myself
I wish I could say
I have no regrets today
But I'm so nervous that I lose my cool
Every time I pick up the phone and try to call you
Standing out in the freezing cold until I'm numb
Wondering why I'm always acting so dumb
I don't want to be this way
I kick myself
I wish I could say
That I have no regrets today
Things just happened to turn out this way
I can't say I have no regrets today
Things happened to turn out this way
I cant say I have no regrets today
