<song artist="Bouncing_Souls" title="Baptized">
Yeah!
Misled again we take up guns and blow it all away
Brothers lost to who we are in terror we exchange
Sleep walking into mass graves
Bought and sold like slaves
It's the end of the old
A new era unfolds
Like a thief in the night taking everything
We won't hear you
We won't hear you
Yeah!
Burned again we stand and fight into the longest night
Facing death we know there's more inside we see a light
Time has come to all rise up cannot be denied
It's the end of the old
A new era unfolds
Like a thief in the night taking everything
We won't hear you
We won't hear you
We won't hear you, baptized
We won't hear you, in fire!
We won't hear you, baptized
We won't hear you, in fire!
Fires raging in black days casting a new light
No more objects in our way the path comes into sight
Kings and thieves all haunted men running in the night
It's the end of the old
A new era unfolds
Like a thief in the night taking everything
We won't hear you
We won't hear you
We won't hear you, baptized
We won't hear you, in fire!
We won't hear you, baptized
We won't hear you, in fire!
