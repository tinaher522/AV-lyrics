<song artist="Bouncing_Souls" title="Shark_Attack">
Shark attack, shark attack
Quarter Pounders and Big Macs
Shark attack, shark attack
When we eat steak our eyes roll back
Bouncing Souls are your block
First we eat and then we rock
Close your windows, lock your doors
We like food better when it's yours
Feeding frenzy at your mom's
Just sit still and stay calm
It's too late, you let us in
Let the eating games begin!
Shark attack
Shark attack
Shark attack
Shark attack
Shark attack, shark attack
Quarter Pounders and Big Macs
Shark attack, shark attack
When we eat steak our eyes roll back
Feeding frenzy in the street
Drinking beer and eating meat
When we're hungry watch your back
As we plan our next attack
Shark attack
Shark attack
Shark attack
Shark attack
