<song artist="Bouncing_Souls" title="Ship_In_A_Bottle">
Oh my good friend let's start something
Then throw it all out to the wind
How many mountains will we conquer?
We'll never know till we begin
Oh, begin
Oh my teacher what should I believe in
And how will I stay strong?
How many misfortunes will we conquer?
How will I carry on?
Oh, carry on
With every peak and valley
With every white knuckled fist
With everything I've lost and learned
I won't let go of this grip
With every storm we weather
I would never miss
I won't give up, I won't let go
I'm going down with the ship, oh
Oh my captain where are we going?
How many battles will we win?
How many brave souls will we lose to the deepest blue?
Will we see our home again?
Oh, home again
With every peak and valley
With every white knuckled fist
With everything I've lost and learned
I won't let go of this grip
With every storm we weather
I would never miss
I won't give up, I won't let go
I'm going down with the ship, oh
I'm going down with the ship,
Whoa
I'm going down with the ship
Oh my good friend let's start something
