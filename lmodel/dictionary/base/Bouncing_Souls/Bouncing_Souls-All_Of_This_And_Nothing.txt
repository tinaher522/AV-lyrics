<song artist="Bouncing_Souls" title="All_Of_This_And_Nothing">
They try to tell you how thing's should be,
how to think, what to wear and
what bands to see. Know your enemy.
Revolution on tv that's a bunch of
shit to me they don't know about you or me.
Know your enemy. They don't
know about you or me no matter what they say
to be they don't know about
you or me the contradictions and
hypocracy they don't know about you or me..
know your enemy. They don't know about
you or me no matter what they say
to be they don't know about you or me.
