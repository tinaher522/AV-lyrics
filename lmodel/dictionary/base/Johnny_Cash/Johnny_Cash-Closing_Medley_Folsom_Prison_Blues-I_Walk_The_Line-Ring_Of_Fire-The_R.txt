I hear the train a comin'
It's rollin' 'round the bend,
I ain't seen the sunshine,
Since, I don't know when,
Lord, I'm stuck in Folsom Prison,
And time keeps draggin' on,
And that train keeps a-rollin',
On down to San...
Let's give her a big hand, June Carter
Helen, Anita, and Mother Mabel, the Carter family
I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time.
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
Because you're mine,
I walk the line
The Stabler Brothers
I fell into a burnin' ring of fire
I went down, down, down
And the flames went higher,
And it burns, burns, burns,
The ring of fire, the ring of fire.
Mr Carl Perkins
Well when I was just a baby,
My Mama told me, "Son,
That I want you to be a good boy,
I don't want you to play with guns,"
But I shot a man in Reno,
I shot him just to watch him die, Lord he dead
Now that train keeps rollin'
I hang my head down and cry.
Johnny Yuma was a rebel
He roamed through the west
And Johnny Yuma, the rebel
He wandered alone.
He got fightin' mad
This rebel lad
He packed no star
As he wandered far
Where the only law
Was a hook and a draw.
The rebel, Johnny Yuma.
I want to thank you, for being so good to us
I'd like to say a special hello to all the men here in the prison
That are not with us tonight
That they couldn't, find a key to the door or something
They couldn't let a bunch of them out here
I wish everyone of you could have been out here with us
All you guys.
I understand they're piping the show into your cells or somewhere
That's supposed to be listening, or maybe,
It's not closed circuit television that you have in here is it?
Anyway, hello to all you fellas who can't be here,
We wish you could have all been here
We have had a ball, have we not?
Well, if they freed me from this prison,
If that railroad train was mine,
I bet I'd move it on a little,
Farther down the line,
Far from Folsom Prison,
That's where I want to stay,
And I'd let that lonesome whistle,
Blow my Blues away.
Johnny Cash
Johnny Cash, and the Tennessee three

Thank you very much, good night
