<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="I_Heard_The_Bells_On_Christmas_Day">
I heard the bells on Christmas Day their old familiar carols play 
And wild and sweet the words repeat of peace on earth goodwill to men 
I thought how as the day had come the belfries of all Christendom 
Had rolled along unbroken song of peace on earth goodwill to men 
And in despair I bowed my head there is no peace on earth I said 
For hate is strong that mocks the song of peace on earth goodwill to men 
(Then pealed the bells more loud and deep God is not dead nor doubt he sleeps 
The wrong shall fail the right prevail with peace on earth goodwill to men) 
Till ringin' singin' on its way the world revolve from night to day 
A voice a chime a chance so blind on earth goodwill to men 
Then pealed the bells more loud and deep God is not dead nor doubt he sleeps 
The wrong shall fail the right prevail with peace on earth goodwill to men
