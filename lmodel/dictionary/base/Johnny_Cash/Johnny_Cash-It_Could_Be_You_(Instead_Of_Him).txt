<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="It_Could_Be_You_(Instead_Of_Him)">
If you should meet some lonely soul who on this earth can't reach his gold 
And he's travelin' down the road so dark and dim 
Lend the hand say a prayer give a smile that he might share 
But for the grace of God it could be you instead of him 
(But for the grace of God it could be you instead of him) 
Be friend each stranger in the night help to make his burdens light 
Lift up the fallin' ones and be a friend 
Shed a tear share a sight Share his fears don't pass him by 
But for the grace of God it could be you instead of him 
(It could be you instead of him) 
Shed a tear share a sight...
