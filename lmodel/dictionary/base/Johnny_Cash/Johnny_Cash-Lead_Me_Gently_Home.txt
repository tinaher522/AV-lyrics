<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="Lead_Me_Gently_Home">
Oh lead me gently home father lead me gently home 
When life's toils are ended and parting days have come 
Sin no more will tempt me there from Thee I'll roam 
If you'll only lead me father lead me gently home 
Oh lead me gently home father lead me gently home 
If I fall upon the wayside lead me gently home 
Lead me gently home father lead me gently home 
If life's darkest hours father when my troubles come 
Keep my feet from wandering there from Thee I'll roam 
Lest I fall upon the wayside lead me gently home 
Oh lead me gently home..
