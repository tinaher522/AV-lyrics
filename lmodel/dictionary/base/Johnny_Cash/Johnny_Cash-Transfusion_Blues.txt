<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="Transfusion_Blues">
Early one mornin' while makin' the rounds 
I took a transfusion (shot of cocaine) and I shot my woman down 
I went right home and I went to bed 
I stuck that lovin' 44 beneath my head 
Got up next mornin' and I grabbed that gun 
Took a transfusion (shot of cocaine) and away I run 
Made a good run but I run too slow
They overtook me down in Juarez, Mexico 
Late in the hot joints takin' the pills 
In walked the sheriff from Jericho Hill 
He said "Willy Lee, your name is not Jack Brown 
You're the dirty hack that shot your woman down"
Said "yes, oh yes, my name is Willy Lee 
If you've got a warrant just-a read it to me 
Shot her down because she made me slow 
I thought I was her daddy but she had five more"
When I was arrested I was dressed in black
They put me on a train and they took me back 
Had no friends for to go my bail 
They slapped my dried up carcass in that county jail 
The next morning 'bout a half past nine
I spied the sheriff comin' down the line
Talked and he coughed as he cleared his throat
"COUGH come on you dirty hack into the district court"
Into the courtroom my trial began 
Where I was handled by twelve honest men 
Just before the jury started out 
I saw the little judge commence to look about 
In about five minutes in walked the man 
Holding the verdict in his right hand 
The verdict read in the first degree 
I hollered "Lowdy, Lowdy have mercy on me"
The judge he smiled as he picked up his pen
99 years in the San Quentin (Folson) pen 
99 years underneath that ground 
I can't forget the day I shot my woman (that bad bitch) down 
Come on you guys and listen unto me 
Lay off that liquor (whiskey) and let that transfusion (cocaine) be
