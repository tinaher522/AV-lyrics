Ride this train let me show you a land of rolling hills and tall corn 
A land of hard working people where rewards are often very small 
This is Pella Iowa 
My mother and father brought me here in 1847 we came from Cork Ireland 
We had a potato famine over there and things had been pretty rough for us 
I remember during the potato famine in Ireland I'd trail along at father's feet 
And we'd try to find enough potatoes for a meal 
And we'd take em back in to mother and she'd cook em coats and all 
Well finally we gave up and somehow we made it to America 
Well our new neighbors here in Pella loaned father oxen 
And ploughs to make his first crop with 
And you never saw taller corn that year than it was on our place 
The next season why we were even lendin' out ploughs and oxen to other farms 
That's the way it was here in the new land 
Everybody helped everybody out if you got sick everybody came to visit 
Even the doctor wouldn't take pay if he thought you couldn't afford it 
But old Doc Brown was always there if you ever needed him
