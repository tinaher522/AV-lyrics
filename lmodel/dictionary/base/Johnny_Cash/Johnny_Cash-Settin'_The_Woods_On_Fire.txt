<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="Settin'_The_Woods_On_Fire">
Comb your hair and paint and powder
You act proud and I'll act prouder
You sing loud and I'll sing louder
Tonight we're setting the woods on fire
You my gal and I'm your feller
Dress up in your frock of yeller
You'll look swell honey, but I'll look sweller
Setting the woods on fire
We'll take in all the honky tonks
Tonight we're having fun
I'll show the folks a brand new dance
That never has been done
Hey, look a here baby
Everything is fine
Gonna sip up a little of wine
Gonna make a little doggone time
Setting the woods on fire
You'll gas up my hot rod stocker
We'll get hotter than a poker
I'll be broke and you'll be broker
Tonight we're setting the woods on fire
We'll sit close to one another
Up the one street and down the other
We'll have a time o brother
Setting the woods on fire
We'll set aside a little time
To fix a flat or two
My tires and tubes are doing fine
But the air is showing through
We'll sit close to one another
Up the one street and down the other
We'll have a time o brother
Setting the woods on fire
