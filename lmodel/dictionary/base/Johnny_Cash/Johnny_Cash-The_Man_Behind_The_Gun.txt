(The man behind the gun)
They gave me the job of a sheriff
Because I'm good with a gun
Now how could I ever refuse them
They really needed someone
I tried to explain to my baby
But still she left me one day
She said she'd return to me only
When I threw my six gun away
And I'm not suppose to be lonely
To need or love anyone
I'm just suppose to be only
The man behind the gun
Then one day she sent me a letter
She said I want you to know
I miss you and my heart is breakin'
I love you and I need you so
The stage it was leavin' next mornin'
I'd be on that stage without fail
Than someone shot ol' Jimmy Taylor
And I took out on his trail
But I'm not suppose to be lonely
To need or love anyone
I'm just suppose to be only
The man behind the gun
Well, three weeks it took I remember
Before I tracked the man down
And when I returned with the pris'nor
It was the talk of the town
To late to go to my baby
They buried her deep in the clay
I spend all these hours in the saddle
And I draw a heartache for pay
(But he's not suppose to be lonely
To need or love anyone)
I'm just suppose to be only
The man behind the gun
(The man behind the gun)
