<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="Southern_Accents">
There's a southern accent, 
Where I come from 
The young'uns call it country 
The Yankees call it dumb 
I got my own way of talkin' 
But everything is done, with a southern accent
Where I come from
Now that drunk tank in Atlanta's
Was just a motel room to me
Think I might go work Orlando
If them orange groves don't freeze
I got my own way of workin'
But everything is run,
With a southern accent
Where I come from
I got my own way of working
When everything is wrong
With a southern accent
Where I come from
For just a minute there
I was dreaming
For just a minute
It was all so real
For just a minute she was standing there, 
With me
There's a dream I keep having
Where my mama comes to me
And she kneels down over by the window
And says a prayer for me
I got my own way of prayin'
But everyone's begun
With a southern accent
Where I come from
We have our own way of livin'
But everything is done
With a southern accent
Where I come from
