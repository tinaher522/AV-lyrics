<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="Just_One_More">
Put the bottle on the table let it stay there till I'm unable 
To see your face in every place that I go 
I've been sitting here too long just remembering that you are gone 
One more drink of wine and if you're still on my mind 
One drink just one more and then another 
I'll keep drinking it won't matter I'll just remember that I once had 
I don't know why I sat and cry every day 
I've been trying to forget but I haven't stopped it yet 
One more drink of wine and if you're still on my mind 
One drink just one more and then another 
Put the bottle on the table...
