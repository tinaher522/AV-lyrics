<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="I_Was_There_When_It_Happened">
There are some people,who say we cannot tell,
Whether we are saved or, whether all is well;
They say we only can hope and, trust that it is so,
But I was there when it happened and I guess I ought to know.
Yes, I know when Jesus saved me (yes, He saved my soul),
The very moment He forgave me (yes, He made me whole);
He took away my heavy burden (yes, He took my sin and),
And He gave me peace within (gave me peace within).
Satan can't make me doubt it (he can't make me doubt it),
It's real and I'm gonna shout it (I'm gonna shout it);
'Cause I was there when it happened (oh, my Lord),
And I guess I ought to know (yes, I ought to know).
Now, I don't care who tells me, salvation is not real,
Though the world may argue, that we cannot feel;
The heavy burdens lifted and the vile sins go,
But I was there when it happened and I guess I ought to know.
