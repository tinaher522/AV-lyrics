<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="Five_Minutes_To_Live">
What all can you give, with five minutes to live?
Hear the tock tick tock of the laughing clock.
What can you do or say?
Maybe you oughta pray.
But you better think positive.
You got five minutes to live.
Time is flying by, now don't you sit there and let it fly.
You better come on strong, you can't stay here long.
That bell is gonna ring.
This is a final fling.
Ain't no alternative.
You got five minutes to live.
What all can you give, With five minutes to live
Get dressed for your date or you're gonna be late.
Live a little while you can.
Don't you sit there and ring your hands.
Here comes a great big sedative.
You got five minutes to live.
