<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="The_Ways_Of_A_Woman_In_Love">
You've cut out your dancing'
And you never see a show
Friends drop by to pick you up
And you hardly ever go
It seems your head in in the clouds above
You've got the ways of a woman in love
I walk by your house at night
In the hopes that I might see
The guy who's got you in a spin
I wish that guy was me
I don't know why it's you I'm dreamin' of
You've got the ways of a woman in love
Many is the night
I've stayed awake and cried
Now you'll never know how much
You've hurt my foolish pride
I recall your kisses
The times I held you tight
Now when I come to see you
You're sittin' in the light
Missing all the things that we dreamed of
You've got the ways of a woman in love.
