<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="I_Don't_Believe_You_Wanted_To_Leave">
&lt;I don't believe you wanted to leave me
You cried to much when you went away
I now deep down inside that you still love me
But you listened to those lying tongues and things they had to say
Of course they said I was to blame
True or not you felt ashamed
And they called you a fool each time you listend to my alibi
But I don't believe you wanted to leave me
You cried to much when we said goodbye
There's gotta be a way to win
Your love back once again
'Cause it just ain't right to let a love like we had fade and die
And I don't believe you wanted to leave me
You cried to much when we said goodbye
