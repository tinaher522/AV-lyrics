Arrested on charges of unemployment
He was sitting in the witness stand
The judges wife looked at the district attorney
Said to free that browned eye man
If you want your job, you better free that brown eyed man
Well, flying across the desert in a TWA
I saw a woman walkin' across the sand
She'd be walking thirty miles en route to Bombay
To meet a brown eyed handsome man
Her destination was a brown eyed handsome man
Way back in history three thousand years
In fact ever since the world began
There's been a whole lot of good women shedding tears
Over a brown eyed handsome man
A lot of trouble with a brown eyed handsome man
Beautiful daughter couldn't make up her mind
Between a doctor and a lawyer man
Her mother told her daughter go out and find yourself
A brown eyed handsome man
Just like your daddy, who is a brown eyed handsome man
Well, the Milo De Venus was a beautiful lass
She had the world in the palm of her hand
She lost both her arms in a wrestling match
To win a brown eyed handsome man
She fought and won herself a brown eyed handsome man
Two, three the count with nobody home
He hit a hi flayer into the stand
Rounded third he was a headin' for home
It was a brown eyed handsome man that won the game
It was a brown eyed handsome man
