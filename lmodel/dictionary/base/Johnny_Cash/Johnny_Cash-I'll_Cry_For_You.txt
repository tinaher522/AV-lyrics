<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="I'll_Cry_For_You">
Take me in your arms and hold me
Give me just a minute more
To help me over all the days that I'll be blue
Take my lips and kiss me gently
'Cause I know that like before
When you leave me all alone I'll cry for you
I haven't got the right to ask for love or sympathy
After I did all the things I shouldn't do
But all I'm asking for is just a little memory
'Cause I know that when you go I'll cry for you
I'll sit and watch the window and I'll pray that you will come
But at the end of every day I'll still be blue
I'll think of all the chances that I had to keep you mine
And like I've done a million times I'll cry for you
Memories that come and linger make me wish we'd never met
Because it seems they're gonna break my heart in two
Either give me love forevermore or help me to forget
'Cause when you're gone far away I'll cry for you
I'll sit and watch the window and I'll pray that you will come
But at the end of every day I'll still be blue
I'll think of all the chances that I had to keep you mine
And like I've done a million times I'll cry for you
