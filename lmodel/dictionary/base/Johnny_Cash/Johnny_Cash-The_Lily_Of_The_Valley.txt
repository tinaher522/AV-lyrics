<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="The_Lily_Of_The_Valley">
I have found a friend in Jesus, He's everything to me
He's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul
He's the Lily of the Valley, in Him alone I see
All I need to cleanse and make me fully whole
In sorrow He's my comfort, in trouble He's my stay
And He tells me every care on Him to roll
He's the lily of the valley, the bright and morning star
He's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul
He will never, never leave me nor yet forsake me here
While I live by faith and do His blessed will
There's a wall of fire about me and I've nothing now to fear
With His manna He my hungry soul shall fill
And then sweeping up to glory to see His blessed face
Where rivers of delight shall ever roll
He's the lily of the valley, the bright and morning star
He's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul
