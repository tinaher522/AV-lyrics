Johnny Cash:
 If I were a carpenter
 And you were a lady,
 Would you marry me anyway?
 Would you have my baby?
June Carter:
 If you were a carpenter,
 And I were a lady,
 I'd marry you anyway.
 I'd have your baby.
Johnny:
 If a tinker was my trade,
 Would I still find you?
June:
 I'd be carryin' the pots you made,
Followin' behind you.
Together:
 Save your love through loneliness,
 Save your love though sorrow,
Johnny:
 I'd give you my onliness,
Together:
 Give me your tomorrow.

Johnny:
 If I were a miller
 At a mill wheel grinding,
 Would you miss your colored blouse,
 And your soft shoes shining?
June:
 If you were a miller,
 At mill wheel grinding,
 I'd not miss my color blouse
 And my soft shoes shining.
Together:
 Save your love through loneliness,
 Save your love though sorrow,
Johnny:
 I'd give you my onliness,
Together:
 Give me your tomorrow.
Johnny:
 If I worked my hands in wood,
 Would you still love me?
June:
 I'd answer you, "Yes I would."
Johnny:
 And would you not be above me?
Johnny:
 If I were a carpenter,
 And you were a lady,
June:
 I'd marry you anyway, 
 I'd have your baby.
Together:
 Save your love through loneliness,
 Save your love though sorrow,
Johnny:
 I'd give you my onliness,
Together:
 Give me your tomorrow.
