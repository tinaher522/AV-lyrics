<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="Keep_On_The_Sunny_Side">
There's a dark and a troubled side of life
There's a bright and a sunny side too
Though we meet with the darkness and strife
The sunny side we also may view
Keep on the sunny side, always on the sunny side
Keep on the sunny side of life
It will help us every day, it will brighten up the way
If we keep on the sunny side of life
Let us greet with a song of hope each day
Though the moments may be cloudy or fair
Let us trust that the Savior always
Will keep us every one in His care
Keep on the sunny side, always on the sunny side
Keep on the sunny side of life
It will help us every day, it will brighten up the way
If we keep on the sunny side of life
Oh, the storm and it's fury broke today
Crushing hopes that I cherished so dear
Storms and clouds will in time pass away
And the sun again will shine bright and clear
Keep on the sunny side, always on the sunny side
Keep on the sunny side of life
It will help us every day, it will brighten up the way
If we keep on the sunny side of life
