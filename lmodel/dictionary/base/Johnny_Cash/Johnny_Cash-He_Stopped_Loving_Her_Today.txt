<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="He_Stopped_Loving_Her_Today">
He said, "I'll love you 'til I die."
She told him, "You'll forget in time."
As the years went slowly by, 
She still prayed upon his mind. 
He kept her picture on the wall.
Went half crazy now and then.
But he still loved her through it all,
Hoping she'd come back again. 
Kept some letters by his bed,
Dated 1962. 
He had underlined in red
Every single 'I love you'. 
I went to see him just today,
But I didn't see no tears.
All dressed up to go away,
First time I'd seen him smile in years. 
He stopped loving her today,
They placed a wreath upon his door,
And soon they'll carry him away,
He stopped loving her today.
You know, she came to see him last time.
And we were all wonderin' if she would.
And it kept runnin' through my mind,
This time he's over her for good. 
He stopped loving her today,
They placed a wreath upon his door,
And soon they'll carry him away,
He stopped loving her today.
