<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="Go_On_Blues">
Go on blues go on lonesome get your dark clouds off of me
Go on blues go on troubles turn loose of me set me free
I've been down through that valley with you
Now I've found me somebody who loves me too
Go on blues go away from me go on by me go on blues
I've been down through
Yeah go on blues go on by me get away from me go on blues
