<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="I_Love_You,_Love_You">
I love you love you
I love you
Just in case you care you know i do
I've done everything i know to do
To catch your eye and get a rise from you
I've said everything i know to say
Till i'm afraid that i'll scare you away
I've tried everything i know to try
And if you won't love me i'm gonna die
I'll be anything i need to be
To make you want to bring your love to me
Cause i love you love you
I love you
Can't help it that i feel the way i do
I love you love you
I love you
Just in case you care you know i do
I'll quit anything i need to quit
Or i'll change anything to make it fit
I'll start anything i need to start
If that would mean you're givin' me your heart
I love you love you
I love you
Can't help it that i feel the way i do
I love you love you
I love you
Just in case you care you know i do
I love you love you
I love you
Can't help it that i feel the way i do
I love you love you
I love you
Just in case you care you know i do
