<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="The_House_Is_Falling_Down">
Men had need of shelter from the evil, from the night
The devilÂ ? wind was blowin? and from heaven came a light
The Son of God, a carpenter and He came with a plan
To build a house where heaven could be offered unto men
When he came here, He laid down a mighty firm foundation
And the columns and the beams were churches, scattered through the nation
And then rooms were added to it on that same old solid rock
And roofs were raised by willing hands, from the bottom to the top
Then the people came and filled the house, were singing prayer and praise
Some turned and rejected, His house fell on leaner days
Oh, Son of God, oh Carpenter, will you come back around
The blocks and beams are crumbling and the house is falling down
Now the storm is raging and the devil's angry roar
He's screaming at the windows and howlin? at the door
And though the faithful few inside are standing true and strong
The house has been neglected and it won't be standin? long
Then the people came and filled the house, were singing prayer and praise
Some turned and rejected, His house fell on leaner days
Son of God, oh Carpenter, will you come back around
Our blocks and beams are crumbling and the house is falling down
Son of God, oh Carpenter, where you come back around
The blocks and beams are crumbling and the house is fallin? down
