<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="The_Three_Bells">
There's a village hidden deep in the valley
Among the pine trees half forlorn
And there on a sunny morning
Little Jimmy Brown was born
All the chapel bells were ringing
In the little valley town
And the songs that they were singing
Were for baby Jimmy Brown
Then the little congregation
Prayed for guidance from above
Lead us not into temptation
Bless this hour of meditation
Guide him with eternal love
There's a village hidden deep in the valley
Beneath the mountains high above
And there, twenty years thereafter
Jimmy was to meet his love
All the chapel bells were ringing
Was a great day in his life
'Cause the songs that they were singing
Were for Jimmy and his wife
Then the little congregation
Prayed for guidance from above
Lead us not into temptation
Bless, oh Lord, this celebration
May their lives be filled with love
From the village hidden deep in the valley
One rainy morning, dark and gray
A soul winged its way to heaven
Jimmy Brown had passed away
Just a lonely bell was ringing
In the little valley town
T'was farewell that it was singing
To our good old Jimmy Brown
And the little congregation
Prayed for guidance from above
Lead us not into temptation
May his soul find the salvation
Of thy great eternal love
