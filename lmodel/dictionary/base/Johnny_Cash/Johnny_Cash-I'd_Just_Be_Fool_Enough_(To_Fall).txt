<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="I'd_Just_Be_Fool_Enough_(To_Fall)">
Oh please don't be so carelss with your glances 
Don't look at me that way and breathe a sigh 
Please don't get too close and let me love you 
Cause I just might be fool enough to try 
It's not that I don't think I'm worthy of you 
But mem'ries from the past I still recall 
Please don't get too close and let me love you 
Cause I just might be fool enough to fall 
It's not that I don't think...
