<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="Österåker_(San_Quentin)">
Österåker, you've been livin' hell to me
You've hosted me since nineteen sixty three
I've seen 'em come and go and I've seen them die
And long ago I stopped askin' why
Österåker, I hate every inch of you
You've cut me and have scarred me thru an' thru
And I'll walk out a wiser weaker man
Mister Congressman why can't you understand
Österåker, what good do you think you do?
Do you think I'll be different when you're through?
You bent my heart and mind and you may my soul
And your stone walls turn my blood a little cold
Österåker, may you rot and burn in hell
May your walls fall and may I live to tell
May all the world forget you ever stood
And may all the world regret you did no good
Österåker, you've been livin' hell to me
