<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="He'll_Be_A_Friend">
Well God told Noah to build an ark he said it's gonna rain gonna be dark 
Call in the animals two by two and don't let a sinful man go through 
So the flood came just like he said and every evil thing on earth was dead 
But Noah's faith was like a rock God laid his ark on a mountain top 
He'll be a friend and guide you he'll walk along with you 
He'll feel it there inside you he'll help you make it through 
When things look dark Noah saw the light cause faith had told him right was might 
If you need a friend he'll guide you he'll be a friend to you 
Well you've heard of Samson the strong man the mightiest man in all the land 
There was one purpose for his might he had to deliver the Israelites 
By the Philistines he was overcome they tied him up to carry him home 
But Samson prayed and his bounds were gone 
He killed a thousand with an old jawbone 
He'll be a friend and guide you he'll walk along with you 
He'll feel it there inside you he'll help you make it through 
God showed Samson what to do and it's the same God that stands by you 
If you need a friend he'll guide you he'll be a friend to you
