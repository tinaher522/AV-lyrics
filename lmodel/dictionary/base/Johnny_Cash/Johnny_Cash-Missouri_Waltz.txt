<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="Missouri_Waltz">
Hush a bye my baby slumber time is coming soon
Rest your head on mommie's breast while daddy hums a tune
Are the old folks were humming the banjos were strumming 
And the soft breezes sigh as in days long gone by
Way down in Missouri where I heard this melody
When I was a little fellow on my mommie's knee
The old folks were humming the banjos were strumming so sweet and low
Hush a bye my baby go to sleep on daddy's knee
Journey back to Dixie Land in dreams again with me
Oh, it seems like your daddy was there once again
And the old folks were strumming that same old refrain
Way down in Missouri when I heard this lullaby
While the stars were blinking and the moon was shining high
Are the old folks were humming the banjos were strumming so sweet and low
