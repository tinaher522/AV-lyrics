<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="Unchained_Melody">
Oh my love, my darling
I've hungered for your touch
A long lonely time
Time goes by so slowly
And time can do so much
Are you still mine
I need your love
I need your love
God speed your love to me
Lonely rivers flow
To the sea
To the sea
To the open arms of the sea
Lonely riverside
Wait for me
Wait for me
I'll be coming home
Wait for me
Time goes by so slowly
And time can do so much
Are you still mine
I need your love
I need your love
God speed your love to me
God speed your love to me
