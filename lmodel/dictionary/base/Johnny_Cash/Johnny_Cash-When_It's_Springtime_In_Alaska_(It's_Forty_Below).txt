<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="When_It's_Springtime_In_Alaska_(It's_Forty_Below)">
When it's springtime in Alaska it's forty below
I mushed from Port Barrol through a blizzard of snow
Been out prospecting for two years or so
Pulled into Fairbanks the city was a boon
So I took a little stroll to the Red Dog Saloon
(Yes he took a little stroll to the Red Dog Saloon)
When I walked through the door the music was clear
The prettiest voice I had heard in two years
The song she kept singin' would make a man's blood run cold
When it's springtime in Alaska it's forty below
(When it's springtime in Alaska it's forty below)
It was red headed Luie that was singin' so sweet
I reached down and took the snowpacks off of my feet
I reached for the gal who was singing the tune
We did the Escimo hop all around the saloon
(We did the Escimo hop all around the saloon)
Where the cariboo crawl and the grizzly bear hug
We did our dance on a Kodiac rug
The song she kept singing would make a man's blood run cold
When it's springtime in Alaska it's forty below
(When it's springtime in Alaska it's forty below)
I was as innocent as I could be
I didn't know that Luie was big Ed's wife to be
He took out his knife and he gave it a throw
When it's springtime in Alaska I'll be six feet below
(When it's springtime in Alaska he's six feet below)
