<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="He'll_Understand_And_Say_Well_Done">
Give when you give him best of your service telling the world that the Saviour has come 
Be not dismayed if man don't believe you he'll understand and say well done 
Oh when I come to the end of my journey weary of life and the battle is won 
Bearing the staff and the cross of redemption he'll understand and say well done 
(He'll understand and say well done) 
Misunderstood the Saviour of sinners died on the cross he was God's only son 
But he knew well that his father in heaven would understand and say well done 
Oh when I come...
