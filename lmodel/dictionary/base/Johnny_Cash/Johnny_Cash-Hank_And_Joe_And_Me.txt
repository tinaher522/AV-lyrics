<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="Hank_And_Joe_And_Me">
In the desert where we searched for gold the days're hot the nights're cold 
Hank and Joe and me walked on so bold and brave and free 
For days and days we fought the heat I got so thirsty and I got so weak 
And when I fell cause I couldn't go I heard Hank say to Joe 
He's dyin' (dyin' dyin') for water hear him cryin' (cryin' cryin') for water 
Well lay him down in the dust and sand he said Joe you know he's a dyin' man 
Leave him there and let him die I can't stand to hear him cry for water 
I don't remember how long I lay but when I awoke it was the break of day 
Buzzards circled miles ahead I knew Hank and Joe were dead 
My eyes were dimmed but I could see a bed of gold nuggets under me 
Now I know that it won't be long till they decorate my bones 
Cause I'm dyin' (dyin' dyin') for water can't help cryin' (cryin' cryin') for water 
Well they laid me down in the dust and sand he said Joe you know he's a dyin' man 
Leave him there and let him die I can't stand to hear him cry for water 
He couldn't stand to hear me cry for water
