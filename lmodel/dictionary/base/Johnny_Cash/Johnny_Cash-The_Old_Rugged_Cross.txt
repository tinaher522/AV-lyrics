<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="The_Old_Rugged_Cross">
On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross the emblem of suffering and shame 
And I love that old cross where the dearest and best 
For a word of lost sinners was slain 
So I'll cherish the old rugged cross till my trophies at last I lay down 
I will cling to the old rugged cross and exchange it some day for a crown 
To the old rugged cross I will ever be true it's shame and reproach gladly bear 
Then he'll call me some day to my home far away where his glory forever I'll share 
So I'll cherish... 
And exchange it some day for a crown
