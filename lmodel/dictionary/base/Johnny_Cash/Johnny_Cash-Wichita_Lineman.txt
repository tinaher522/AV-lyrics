<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="Wichita_Lineman">
I am a lineman for the county 
And I drive the main road
Searching in the sun 
For another overload
I hear you singing in the wires
I can hear you through the whine
And the Wichita lineman
Is still on the line
I know I need a small vacation
But it don't look like rain
And if it snows 
That stretch down south 
Won't ever stand the strain
And I need you more than want you
And I want you for all time
And the Wichita lineman
Is still on the line
And I need you more than want you
And I want you for all time
And the Wichita lineman
Is still on the line
