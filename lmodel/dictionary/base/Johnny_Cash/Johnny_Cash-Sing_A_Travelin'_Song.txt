<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="Sing_A_Travelin'_Song">
Hey little girl, with tears in your eyes
Don't waste your time now, askin' me why
I don't know, I know I'll just be movin' along
You'd say that home is where my love is at
I say that home is where I hang my hat
The time has come to sing a travelin' song
You own a house and a lot of close friends
I love the feel of my back to the wind
The two won't match, you know the caves so wild would be wrong
You want your friends and love, a child and a home
You can't buy love on a twenty year loan
The time has come to sing a travelin' song
Someday where we sat on that old porch swing
A tamer man might offer you a ring
A man that wants his friends and neighbors, a child and a home
Don't waste your tears on dreams that never can be
What's right for others is not right for me
The time has come to sing a travelin' song
The time has come to sing a travelin' song
