ANNOUNCER:
And now, Johnny Cash will sing the Rebel, back in 1961.

Johnny Yuma was a rebel
He roamed through the west
And Johnny Yuma, the rebel
He wandered alone.
He got fightin' mad
This rebel lad
He packed no star
As he wandered far
Where the only law
Was a hook and a draw.
The rebel, Johnny Yuma.
Johnny Yuma was a rebel
He roamed through the west
Johnny Yuma, the rebel
He wandered alone.
He searched the land
This restless lad
He was panther quick
And leather tough
'Cause he figured that
He'd been pushed enough.
The rebel, Johnny Yuma.
Johnny Yuma was a rebel
He roamed through the west
Johnny Yuma, the rebel
He wandered alone.
Fightin' mad
This rebel lad
With a dream he'd hold
'Til his dyin' breath
He'd search his soul
And gamble with death.
The rebel, Johnny Yuma.
(Away,away,away rode the rebel Johnny Yuma)
