<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="El_Matador">
The crowd is waiting for the bullfight
Matador
My final fight the place is packed once more
But Anita won't throw me a rose this fight
The one she wears is not for me tonight
She's watching now with her new love I know
Walk proud and slow
Be strong and sure give the crowd a show
They want blood you know!
You're still their idol as you were before
Kill just one more!
Remind Anita, you're the greatest Matador
The time is come, forget Anita in the stands
Be a tall and strong and brave and noble man
Be better than you've never been before
Make this your greatest moment Matador
She's watching now with her new love I know
Walk proud and slow
Be strong and sure give the crowd a show
They want blood you know!
You're still their idol as you were before
Kill just one more!
Remind Anita, you're the greatest Matador
