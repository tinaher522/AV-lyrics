<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="Seal_It_In_My_Heart_And_Mind">
As the bible is laid open
And the bread of life I find
In the words that you have spoken
Seal it in my heart and mind
Seal it in my heart and mind Lord
Seal it in my heart and mind
Let me always take it with me
Seal it in my heart and mind
I find prove of your forgiveness
And what wisdom there I find
And the strenght for daily living
Seal it in my heart and mind
Seal it in my heart and mind Lord
Seal it in my heart and mind
Let me always take it with me
Seal it in my heart and mind
Words of love and inspiration
Light to guide me when I'm blind
Keep me filled in preparation
Seal it in my heart and mind
Seal it in my heart and mind Lord
Seal it in my heart and mind
Let me always take it with me
Seal it in my heart and mind
