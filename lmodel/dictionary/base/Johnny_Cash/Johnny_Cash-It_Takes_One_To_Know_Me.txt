<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="It_Takes_One_To_Know_Me">
It's true that I used to be crazy
And harder to love than most men
And the blood that ran in these tired hands
Was harder and wilder back then
And I don't feel as tall as I used to
Maybe it's just that I've grown
You're the one that held my  hand when I fell
If I just couldn't make it alone
We've lived out all the stories
Sang all the old songs
It takes one to know me
I guess you're the one
Your daughters are ladies of fortune
And your son an heir to the throne
And though this crown that I hold is 
Tarnished and cold
It's a symbol of all that we own
Sometimes I wish I was younger
And could pick up the pieces and run
But then I look back on the matter of fact
And it's a race that we've already won
We've lived out all the stories
Sang all the old songs
It takes one to know me
I guess you're the one
We've lived out all the stories
Sang all the old songs
It takes one to know me
And you knew the one
