<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="Big_River">
Well I taught that weeping willow how to cry,
And I showed the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky.
And the tears that I shed for my baby are gonna flood you Big River.
And I don't care if I sit here and die.
Well I met her accidentally in St. Paul (Minnesota).
And it tore me upÂ ??? heard her drawl, Southern drawl.
But then I heard that my dream was Downstream cavortin' in Davenport,
And I followed you, Big River, cause you called.
Well you took me to St. Louis later on (down the river).
A freighter said she's been here but she's gone, boy, she's gone.
Well I found her trail in Memphis, but she just walked up the block.
She raised a few eyebrows and then she went on down alone.
Now  I rolled into Natchez the next day, down the river,
But there wasn't much there to make a rounder stay very long,
She got moving in her blood (???) and I got it all from you
Big River, why you make that gal that way
Well now, batter down by Baton Rouge, River Queen, bat it down.
You got my Baby take her own down to New Orleans, New Orleans
Let her go I've had enough dump the blues down in the Gulf
It's you she loves Big River it ain't me
Well I taught that weeping willow how to cry,
And I showed the cloud how to cover up a clear blue sky.
And the tears that I shed for my baby are gonna flood you Big River.
And I don't care if I sit here till die.nd wanting
Your houses are built upon the sand"
