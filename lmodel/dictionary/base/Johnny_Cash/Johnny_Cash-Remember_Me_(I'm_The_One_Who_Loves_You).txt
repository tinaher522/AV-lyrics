<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="Remember_Me_(I'm_The_One_Who_Loves_You)">
When you're all alone and blue
No one to tell your troubles to
Remember me, I'm the one who loves you 
When this world has turned you down
And not a true friend can be found
Remember me, I'm the one who loves you 
And through all kinds of weather
You'll find I'll never change
Through the sunshine and the shadows
I'll always be the same 
We're together right or wrong
Where you go I'll tag along
Remember me, I'm the one who loves you 
(And through all kinds of weather
You'll find I'll never change)
Through the sunshine and the shadows
I'll always be the same 
We're together right or wrong
Where you go I'll tag along
Remember me, I'm the one who loves you
Remember me, I'm the one who loves you
