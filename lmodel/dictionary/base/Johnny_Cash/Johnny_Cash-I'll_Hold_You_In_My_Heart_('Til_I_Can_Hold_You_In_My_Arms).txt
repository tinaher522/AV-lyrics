I got a feelin' called the blu-ues, oh, Lawd
Since my baby said goodbye
And I don't know what I'll do-oo-oo
All I do is sit and sigh-igh, oh, Lawd
That last long day she said goodbye
Well Lawd I thought I would cry
She'll do me, she'll do you, she's got that kind of lovin'
Lawd, I love to hear her when she calls me
Sweet dad-ad-ad-dy, such a beautiful dream
I hate to think it all o-o-ver
I've lost my heart it seems
I've grown so used to you some how
Well, I'm nobody's sugar daddy now
And I'm lo-on-lonesome
I got the Lovesick Blu-ues.
Well, I'm in love, I'm in love, with a beautiful gal
That's what's the matter with me
Well, I'm in love, I'm in love, with a beautiful gal
But she don't care about me
Lawd, I tried and I tried, to keep her satisfied
But she just wouldn't stay
So now that she is lea-eav-in'
This is all I can say.
I got a feelin' called the blu-ues, oh, Lawd
Since my baby said goodbye
And I don't know what I'll do-oo-oo
All I do is sit and sigh-igh, oh, Lawd
That last long day she said goodbye
Well Lawd I thought I would cry
She'll do me, she'll do you, she's got that kind of lovin'
Lawd, I love to hear her when she calls me
Sweet dad-ad-ad-dy, such a beautiful dream
I hate to think it all o-o-ver
I've lost my heart it seems
I've grown so used to you some how
Well, I'm nobody's sugar daddy now
And I'm lo-on-lonesome
I got the Lovesick Blu-ues.
