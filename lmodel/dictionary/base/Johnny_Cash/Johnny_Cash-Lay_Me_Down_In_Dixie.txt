<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="Lay_Me_Down_In_Dixie">
Lay me down in dixie, let the world go by me,
I'm gonna stay right there 'till Gabriel calls
Pull your dreams around me, wrap me in your memory,
Lord, I love dixie most of all
Somewhere in the land where the warm sun is shining
Somewhere someone's speaking in the warm southern brogue
Lay me down in dixie, where they understand me,
Lord, I love dixie most of all
Lay me down in dixie, and when they come to take me,
You know that I'll be ready when they call
For I have seen the daylight, so I do not fear the midnight,
Lord, I love dixie most of all
Somewhere in the land where the warm sun is shining
Somewhere someone's speaking in the warm southern brogue
Lay me down in dixie, where they understand me,
Lord, I love dixie most of all
Lord, I love dixie most of all
