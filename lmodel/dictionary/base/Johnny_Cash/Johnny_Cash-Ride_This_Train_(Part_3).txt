Ride this train to Roseburg Oregon now there's a town for you 
And you talk about rough 
You know a lot of places in the country claim Paul Bunyon lived there 
But you should have seen Roseburg when me and my daddy'd come there 
Everyone of them loggers looked like Paul Bunyon to me 
As I was a skinny kid about sixteen 
And I was scared to death when we walked into that camp 
None of the lumberjacks paid any attention to me at first 
But when my pa told the boss that me and him wanted a job 
A lot of 'em stopped their work to see what was gonna happen 
That big boss walked around me looked me up and down and said 
Mister I believe that boy is made out of second growth timber and I guess I was Everybody but me and pa had a big laugh over it 
Pa got kinda mad and the boss finally said he might start me out as a high climber 
I didn't know what a high climber was boy I sure learned fast 
That steel corded rope cut my back and that axe 
I thought it was gonna break my arms off but I stuck with it 
It wasn't long till I learned that a man's got to be 
A lot tougher than the timber he's cuttin' 
Finally I could swing that crosscut saw with the best of them
