<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="My_Shoes_Keep_Walking_Back_To_You">
I may say that I don't care hold up head up in the air 
Even tell my friends I'm glad that you don't call 
But when the day is through my heartaches start anew 
And that's when I miss you most of all 
And my arms keep reaching for you my eyes keep searching for you 
My lips keep calling for you and my shoes keep walking back to you 
No matter how much I pretend I wish I had you back again 
Cause nothing else means half as much as you 
My world just seemed to die the day you left my side 
And I can't forget no matter what I do 
And my arms keep reaching...
