<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="You_Can't_Beat_Jesus_Christ">
He was born to be known as everybody's brother
He is the Father, Son, and Mary is His mother
He is a 'scuse my slanguage
Well, a compound country kinda guy
(Yes, He is)
Ain't no way to get around it
You just can't beat Jesus Christ
(No, you can't)
I used to crank and drank
Until my back was to the floor
I'd take it to the limit
Then I'd try to get some more
Yeah, when it came to gamblin'
Well, the Lord God knows I'd roll them dice
(Yes, I would)
Ain't no reason to deny it
I have been saved by Jesus Christ
Praise the Lord
Well, even though I am a sinner
He will always be my friend
He starts in the middle
And He does not have an end
And when my soul was held for ransom
Well, He is the one that paid the price
There ain't no two ways about it
I owe it all to Jesus Christ
You know I do
He was born to be known as everybody's brother
He is the Father, Son, and Mary is His mother
He is a 'scuse my slanguage
Well, a compound country kinda guy
Ain't no way to get around it
You just can't beat Jesus Christ
I mean it
(Hallelujah)
