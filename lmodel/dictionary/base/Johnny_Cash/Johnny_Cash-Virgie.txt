<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="Virgie">
Here's a song called Virgie that I wrote for Aunt Virgie Haughs and I dedicate it to her husband, to her children and the countless people that loved her so much.
Virgie, your house was always warm,
And my bed was always ready when I came.
Virgie, in the middle of the night,
You would welcome friends of mine without a name.
And you could always hear and see, 
The turning of the key,
And your laughing voice to me was like a song.
Virgie, your spirit sweet and free,
Is living still with me though you're gone
Hmmmmm....
Virgie, you spoke soflty and kind,
And you never said a word to critize,
Virgie your children love you so,
More that we ever let you realize
And they are all I knew
That I could bring my cares to you, 
And when I was wrong you never put me down.
Virgie, there's so much I could say
But I can't find the way to write it down,
Can't find the way to write it down...
Hmmmmm.....
