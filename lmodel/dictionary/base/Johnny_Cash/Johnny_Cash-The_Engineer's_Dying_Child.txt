<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="The_Engineer's_Dying_Child">
A little child on a sickbed lay, 
And death was very near.
He was the pride and the only child of a railroad engineer.
His duty had called him from those he loved,
And seeing that hope was dim.
While a tear he shed to his wife he said, "Just have two lanterns trimmed."
Just hang a light when I pass tonight.
Hang it where it can be seen.
If the baby's dead then show the red.
If he's better then show the green.
In a little shack,
By the railroad track,
A mother with watchful eyes.
Saw a gleam of hope in a tender smile, 
As the train went rushing by,
Just one short look,
Was his only chance?
To see the light a gleam.
In the midnight air their rose a prayer. 
Thank god the light was green.
Just hang a light when I pass tonight.
Hang it where it can be seen.
If the baby's dead then show the red.
If he's better then show the green.
