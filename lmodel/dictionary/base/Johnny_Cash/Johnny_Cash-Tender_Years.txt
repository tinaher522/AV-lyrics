<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="Tender_Years">
You keep saying you love him
I believe that it's true
And it just doesn't matter
How much I love you
But in time you'll understand, dear
When you shed a tear
Then you'll know you were living
In your tender years
In your eyes there's a love light
That shines for him
But how long will it stay there
Will that love light grow dim
You can just see the happiness
You can't see the tears
Yes it's true, you've been living
In your tender years
So if I can't be your first love
I'll wait and be your last
I'll be somewhere in your future
To help you forget the past
Then you'll know that I love you
With a love that's sincere
'Cause I'll wait 'til you're through living
In your tender years
Yes, you'll know that I love you
With a love that's sincere
Yes, I'll wait 'til you're through living
In your tender years
