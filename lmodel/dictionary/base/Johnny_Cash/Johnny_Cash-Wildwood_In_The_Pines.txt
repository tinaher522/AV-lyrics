<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="Wildwood_In_The_Pines">
There's a wildwood in the pines where the family used to gather.
There's a little shady grove where they built a country church.
They was singing in the ground. Baptisin' in the river.
Glory! Hallelja, brother! Sweet salvation there was found.
So I believe that the saints go side-by-side in the land that lies up yonder. 
I believe that there are streets there paved with gold.
There are people on their feet shoutin', singin' halleluja! 
I believe that Jesus loves me. I can feel it in my soul.
There's a long and windin' road that I long once more to travel.
There's a homeplace in my heart sittin' high upon a hill.
There's a rosewood rockin' chair and a place set at the table.
Guess I better have a little talk with Jesus. Maybe he can take me there.
So I believe that the saints go side-by-side in the land that lies up yonder. 
I believe that there are streets there paved with gold.
There are people on their feet shoutin', singin' halleluja! 
I believe that Jesus loves me. I can feel it in my soul.
So I believe that the saints go side-by-side in the land that lies up yonder. 
I believe that there are streets there paved with gold.
There are people on their feet shoutin', singin' halleluja! 
I believe that Jesus loves me. I can feel it in my soul.
