<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="I'll_Take_You_Home_Again_Kathleen">
I'll take you home again Kathleen
Across the ocean wild and wide
To where your heart has ever been
Since first you were my pleasent bride
The roses all have left your cheek
I watch them fade away and die
Your voice is sadden when you speak
And tears bedim your loving eyes
Oh, would I will take you back Kathleen
To where your heart will feel no pain
And when the fields are fresh and green
I will take you to your home again
