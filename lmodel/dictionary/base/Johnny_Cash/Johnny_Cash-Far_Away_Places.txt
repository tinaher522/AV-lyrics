<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="Far_Away_Places">
Those far away places with strange-soundin' names 
Far away over the sea 
Those far away places with the strange-soundin' names 
Are callin', callin' me 
Goin' to China or maybe Siam 
I want to see for myself 
Those far away places I've been readin' about 
In a book that I took from the shelf 
I start gettin' restless whenever I hear 
The whistle of a train 
I pray for the day I can get underway 
And look for those castles in Spain 
They called me a dreamer, well maybe I am 
But I know that I'm longin' to see 
Those far away places with the strange-soundin' names 
Callin', callin' me 
Callin', callin' me
