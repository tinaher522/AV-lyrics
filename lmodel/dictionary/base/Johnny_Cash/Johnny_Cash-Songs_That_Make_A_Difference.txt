<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="Songs_That_Make_A_Difference">
Hey babe, do you remember, back in 1969?
We gathered round the room, you sang yours and I sang mine
We took turns with the guitar, in the front and center seat
Shel and Kris and Dylan, and a couple off the street
Joni Mitchell cried on, "Both Sides Now"
We sang songs that made a difference and we can again somehow
Everybody knew that this was quite a special night
Graeme Nash was nervous in the hot seat, in the light
Joe South was total magic and we all walked in his shoes
Orbison and Rabbit cried and they rocked the country blues
New Berry, San Francisco, Maybelle, Joy
We sang songs that made a difference
June was pregnant with my boy
Oh, I could make a livin' drivin' nails or drivin' trucks
Sleep beneath the bridge or in the streets, down on my luck
I'd stand the cold and hunger, if they'd let me hear the songs
Everybody write one that us bums can sing along
Keep it from the heart and down to earth
Sing the songs that make a difference
Give us all our money's worth
Hey, keep it from the heart and down to earth
Sing the songs that make a difference
Give us all our money's worth
