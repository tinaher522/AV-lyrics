<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="Roughneck">
Born to be a roughneck I'll never amount to nothin' 
Pullin' case and layin' pipe is hard labor 
Well I was born in a boomer shack bout a half mile from town 
Papa was a driller on a wildcat crew and my mama never was around 
I learn to cuss when I was two and fight when I was three 
And by the time I was five there was no kid alive could ever get the best of me 
Born to be a roughneck... 
Well I started workin' like a regular man when I was just about knee high 
Skinning the knuckles with my two bare hands but they never heard me cry 
I remember walkin' down the road and hearin' somebody say 
He was born to live a rougneck's life and he's never gonna change his ways 
Born to be a roughneck... 
Born to be a roughneck...
