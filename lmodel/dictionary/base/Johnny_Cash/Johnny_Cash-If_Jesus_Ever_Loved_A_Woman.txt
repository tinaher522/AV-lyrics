If Jesus ever loved a woman, I think Mary Magdalene
Was the woman that He loved
If Jesus ever loved a woman
It was Mary Magdalene
His life was pure perfection
And He never did no sin, nor lust nor greed
And He fell to no temptation
And only did His Father know about His human need
And many were the women and the men
Who followed each place He was seen
From seven dirty devils
Did He free the soul of Mary Magdalene
If Jesus ever loved a woman, I think Mary Magdalene
Was the woman, Jesus loved
If Jesus ever loved a woman
It was Mary Magdalene
He never did condemn a man, a woman
Just for being man, or woman
And He always will forgive
If someone tells Him, that they're really truly sorry
But He couldn't stand a hypocrite
A person who'd pretend that they were holy
And we're not
I'd think He'd loved someone like Mary Magdalene, quiet a lot
If Jesus ever loved a woman, I think Mary Magdalene
Was the woman that He loved
If Jesus ever loved a woman, it was Mary Magdalene
If Jesus ever loved a woman, I think Mary Magdalene
Was the woman that He loved
If Jesus ever loved a woman, it was Mary Magdalene
