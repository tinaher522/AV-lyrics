<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="That_Old_Wheel_-_With_Hank_Williams,_Jr.">
That old wheel is gonna roll around once more
When it does it will even up the score
Don't be weak, as they sow, they will reap
Turn the other cheek and don't give in
That old wheel will roll around again
When love is gone and the one you thought would stay
Does you wrong, and you're left alone to pay
The price is high but somehow you'll survive, don't give in
That old wheel will roll around again
That old wheel is gonna roll around once more
When it does it will even up the score
Don't be weak, as they sow, they will reap
Turn the other cheek and don't give in
That old wheel will roll around again
There'll be times, hard to control
And you'll find you'll hurt down in your soul
There'll be those who'll be glad to see you down
But don't give in, that old wheel will roll around again
That old wheel is gonna roll around once more
When it does it will even up the score
Don't be weak, as they sow, they will reap
Turn the other cheek and don't give in
That old wheel will roll around again
That old wheel is gonna roll around once more
When it does it will even up the score
Don't be weak, as they sow, they will reap
Turn the other cheek and don't give in
That old wheel will roll around again
Roll around, around, again, again
