<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="Lead_Me_Father">
When my hands are tired and my step is slow 
Walk beside me and give me the strenght to go 
Fill my face with your courage so defeat won't show 
Pick me up when I stumble so the world won't know 
Lead me Father with the staff of life give me the strenght for a song 
That the words I sing might more strenght bring 
To help some poor troubled weary worker along 
When my way is light but I still can see 
With a strong hand strike out the blindness in me 
Show me work that I should carry on for Thee 
Make my way straight and narrow like you wanted to be 
Lead me Father...
