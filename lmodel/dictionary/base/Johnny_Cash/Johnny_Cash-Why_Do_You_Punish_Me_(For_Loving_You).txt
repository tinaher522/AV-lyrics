<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="Why_Do_You_Punish_Me_(For_Loving_You)">
Why do you punish me for loving you
You're counting my mistakes how about yours
Why do you sentence me too nice of tears
Convicting all these dreams I've dreamed for all these years
My heart cries out behind these prison bars
It pleads to you for your true love to set it free
Why do you punish me is love a crime
If so I'll spend the lifetime loving serving time
My heart cries out behind...
