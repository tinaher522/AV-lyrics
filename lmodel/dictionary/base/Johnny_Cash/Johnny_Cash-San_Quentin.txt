<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="San_Quentin">
San Quentin you've been living hell to me
You've blistered me since 1963
I've seen them come and go and I've seen them die
And long ago I stopped asking why
San Quentin I hate every inch of you
You've cut me and you've scarred me through and through
And I'll walk out a wiser, weaker man
Mr. Congressman, you can't understand.
San Quentin what good do you think you do?
Do you think I'll be different when you're through?
You bend my heart &amp; mind and you warp my soul
Your stone walls turn my blood a little cold
San Quentin may you rot and burn in hell
May your walls fall and may I live to tell
May all the world forget you ever stood
And the whole world will regret you did no good
San Quentin I hate every inch of you.
