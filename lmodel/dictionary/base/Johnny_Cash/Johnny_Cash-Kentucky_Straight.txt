<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="Kentucky_Straight">
Up in Kentucky they make a whiskey
They call a Kentucky Straight Whiskey
And up in Kentucky I married a woman
That I bet she is a better woman
Than that whiskey is whiskey
I call her my Kentucky Straight
I've rambled round the country side
I've drifted near and far
I've been off to seek my fortune
I've been followin' every star
I've rode the devil's highway
The hell bound interstate
But now I'm back at happy shack
With my Kentucky Straight
And we rise up every morning with the chicken
And every minute we're alive we're livin'
She's a little bit old fashioned but her lovin's up to date
And I'm happy here with my Kentucky Straight
I had looked for satisfaction in the arms of quite a few
And I've done everything that I was big enough to do
But everywhere I see her face from Maine to Golden Gate
And I knew that this is where it's at with my Kentucky Straight
And we rise up every morning with the chicken
And every minute we're alive we're livin'
I love her so she knows that it was worth a while to wait
Cause I'm happy here with my kentucky straight
