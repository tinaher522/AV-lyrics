<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="Your_Loving_Gift">
You gave me a blanket to keep me from the cold
You gave me a song I learned to sing
You showed me some beauty
Through the windows of your soul
And you showed me a world I've never seen
Each giving to the other love an' givin' it away
We spent the precious time we knew was borrowed
'Cause you gave me the courage
To live with yesterday
And you gave me tomorrow
You brought me a candle to light my way to bed
You erased those shadows I'd been seeing
You brought me a pillow to rest my weary head
You taught me a gentle way of dreaming
And even if you leave me
I'll be richer when you go
I'm richer with the lovin' gift you gave me
'Cause you gave me a blanket to keep me from the cold
And you gave me a baby
