<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="When_I_Think_Of_You">
I think of you when I hear songs we used to sing
I think of you and I remember everything
When someone that we knew brings up the things we used to do
I start to feeling lonely, and my heart breaks right in two
I see your face in every daydream that I know
Can't sleep at night because I need and miss you so
Just when I think that I'll forget and find somebody new
I get that empty feeling, and I think of you
I close my eyes and make believe you're standing near
I whisper "I love you" and make believe you hear
I tell the world that no one else will ever, ever do
It seems as if you're with me when I think of you
