<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="Stand_By_Your_Man">
Sometimes its hard to be a woman
Givin' all your love to just one man
You'll have bad times
And he'll have good times
Doin' things that you don't understand
But if you love him you'll forgive him
Even though he's hard to understand
And if you love him
Oh, be proud of him
'Cause, after all, he's just a man
Stand by your man
Give him two arms to cling to
And something warm to come to
When nights are cold and lonely
Stand by your man
And show the world you love him
Keep givin' all the love you can
Stand by your man [Repeat: x 2]
