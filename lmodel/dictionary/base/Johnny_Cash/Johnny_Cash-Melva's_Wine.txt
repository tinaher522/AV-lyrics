<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="Melva's_Wine">
Every year about this time
My wife Melva made some wine
Every year about this time
The air is sweet as Melva's wine
And I sip her wine and I listen to the robin sings
And the river runs through Kingston Springs
Every year about this time
A few old friends come up to walk
Every year about this time
A few old friends stop by to talk
And we talk about the crops and weather and things
And the young folks here in Kingston Springs
I got the brother up Chicago way
He wants me to visit him someday and I may sometimes
But not as long as the robin sings
And the river runs through Kingston Springs
It was last year about this time
Melva made her last batch of wine
It was last year about this time
She left for me her warm sweet wine
She could sing as sweet as robins sing
Above her grape in Kingston Springs
'Cause it was last year about this time
That Melva made this glass of wine
I got the brother up Chicago way
He wants me to visit him someday and I may sometimes
But not as long as the robin sings
And the river runs through Kingston Springs
'Cause that was last year about this time
That Melva made this glass of wine
