<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="Tennessee_Stud">
Back about eighteen and twenty-five
I left Tennessee very much alive
I never would-a made it through the Arkansas mud
If I hadn't been ridin' on a Tennessee stud
Had some trouble with my sweetheart's pa
One of her brothers was a bad outlaw
I wrote a letter to my Uncle Fudd
And I rode away on a Tennessee stud
The Tennessee stud was long and lean
The color of the sun and his eyes were green
He had the nerve and he had the blood
There never was a hoss like the Tennessee stud
Drifted on down into no-man's land
I crossed the river called the Rio Grande
Raced my hoss with a Spaniard's foal
'Til I got me a skin full o' silver and gold
Me and the gambler, we couldn't agree
We got in a fight over Tennessee
Pulled our guns and he fell with a thud
And I rode away on a Tennessee stud
The Tennessee stud was long and lean
The color of the sun and his eyes were green
He had the nerve and he had the blood
There never was a hoss like the Tennessee stud
I rode right back across'd Arkansas
I whupped her brother and I whupped her pa
I found that girl with the golden hair
And she was ridin' on a Tennessee mare
Purrty little baby on the cabin floor
Little hoss colt playin' 'round the door
I love the girl with the golden hair
And the Tennessee stud loves the Tennessee mare.
The Tennessee stud was long and lean
The color of the sun and his eyes were green
He had the nerve and he had the blood
There never was a hoss like the Tennessee stud
