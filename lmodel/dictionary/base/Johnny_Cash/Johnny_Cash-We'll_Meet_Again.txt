<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="We'll_Meet_Again">
We'll meet again,
don't know where- don't know when.
But I know we'll meet again some sunny day.
Keep smiling through just like you always do.
Til' the blue skies drive the grey clouds far away.
And will you please say hello to the folks that I know,
tell them that I won't be long.
And they'll be happy to know, that as you watched me go,
I was singing this song.
We'll meet again.
Don't know where- Don't know when.
But I know we'll meet again some sunny day.
Yeah we'll meet again,
and I don't know where and I don't know when
but I do know that we'll meet again some sunny day.
So hunny, keep on smiling through,
just like you always do.
Till' the blue skies drive the grey clouds far away.
And would you please say hello 
to all the folks that I know.
And tell em I won't be long.
They'll be happy to know,
that as you watched me go,
I was singing this song.
We'll meet again,
Don't know where- Don't know when.
But I know we'll meet again some sunny day.
