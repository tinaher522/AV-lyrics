<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="The_Story_Of_A_Broken_Heart">
Hmm the story of a broken heart 
Well the sprinftime is coming and the honeybees are humming 
And I just saw a robin flying by 
While your wedding bells are ringing my poor heart is singing 
The story of a broken heart hmm the story of a broken heart 
When the trees start to blooding the mem'ries start to flooding 
And my heart takes a trip to yesterday 
When we walked neath the moon an our love was in bloom 
Now we're two lovers drifted apart hmm the story of a broken heart 
Now the wedding invitation forced out to your relation 
But you ask me to give the pride away 
Although I can't show it I think that you'll know it 
A story that's told from my heart hmm the story of a broken heart
