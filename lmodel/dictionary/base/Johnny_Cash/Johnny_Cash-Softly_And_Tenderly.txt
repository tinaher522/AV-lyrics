<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="Softly_And_Tenderly">
Softly and tenderly Jesus is calling calling for you and for me 
See on the portal he's waiting and watching watching for you and for me 
Come home come home ya who are weary come home 
Earnestly tenderly Jesus is calling calling oh sinner come home 
[ horns ] 
Oh for the wonderful love he has promised promised for you and for me 
Though we have sinn'd he has mercy and pardon pardon for you and for me 
Come home come home...
