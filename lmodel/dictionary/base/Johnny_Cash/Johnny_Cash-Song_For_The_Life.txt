<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="Song_For_The_Life">
I don't drink the way that I used to
Lately that just ain't my style.
And the hard times don't hurt like they once did
They pass more quickly like when I was wild
And somehow I've learnt how to listen
To a sound like the sun going down
In the magic the mornin' is bringin'
There's a song for the life I have found
It keeps my feet on the ground
The midsummer days ain't to heavy
They just flow like a breeze through my mind.
And nothing appears in a hurry
To make up for some old lost time
And somehow I've learnt how to listen
To a sound like the sun going down
In the magic the mornin' is bringin'
There's a song for the life I have found
It keeps my feet on the ground
Somehow I've learnt how to listen
To a sound like the breeze dyin' down
In the magic the mornin' is bringin'
There's a song for the life I have found
It keeps my feet on the ground
