<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="Seasons_Of_My_Heart">
The seasons come the seasons go we get a little sunshine rain and snow 
Just the way that it was planned to be 
But there's no seasons in my heart while you play the leading part 
Cause the flowers will bloom eternaly 
Your leaving will bring autumn sorrow and my tears like withered leaves will fall 
But spring could bring some glad tomorrow and darling we could be happy after all 
As it is in nature's plan no season get the upper hand 
How I try to keep this fact in mind 
The trees are bare the cold wind blows and by experience we should know 
Winter comes but the spring is close behind 
Your leaving will bring...
