<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="The_General_Lee">
I'm a charger
That charges through the night
Like an orange bolt of lightning
Passing everything in sight
I'm the best pal the Duke boys ever had
I'm thunder on the highway looking bad, bad, bad
I'm a knight
Like the kind in shining armor
With my polished body gleaming
I'm a fighter and a charger
If trouble comes your way just ask for me
My friends all know me as the General Lee
I'm the General Lee
A pistol pumping steel belted cavalry
I'll never let you down when you're riding with me
Buckle up and I'll show you what I mean
Take a look back there
Sirens going, red lights flashing everywhere
We'll cross the field and we'll be running free
They'll eat dust with compliments of me
The General Lee
I'm a hero
And that's how I'll make you feel
When you're riding shotgun with me
And the law is at your heels
I'm glory bound but when the chase is done
I'll take off through the mountains and have fun, fun, fun
I've got style
Tearing through the curves
Let my flag wave proudly to the people that I serve
I'm number one and I will always be
The pride of the south they call the General Lee
I'm the General Lee
A pistol pumping steel belted cavalry
I'll never let you down when you're riding with me
Buckle up and I'll show you what I mean
Take a look back there
Sirens going, red lights flashing everywhere
I'll jump that pond and we'll be running free
And they'll go swimming compliments of me
The General Lee
The General Lee
The General Lee
