<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="T_For_Texas">
Give me a t for texas, give me a t for tennessee
Give me a t for texas, give me a t for tennessee
Give me a t for thelma, woman made a fool out of me
If you don't want me baby, mama you sure don't got to stall
If you don't want me baby, mama you sure don't got to stall
I've had more pretty women than a passenger train could haul
I'm gonna buy myself a shotgun, one with a long shiny barrel
I'm gonna buy myself a shotgun, one with a long shiny barrel
I'm gonna shoot me a rounder oh that stole away my gal
I'd rather drink your muddy water, sleep down in a hollow log
I'd rather drink your muddy water, sleep down in a hollow log
Than to be in atlanta, georgia, treat me like a dirty dog
(I don't have to go for that)
If you don't want me baby, mama you sure don't got to stall
If you don't want me baby, mama you sure don't got to stall
'cause I've had more pretty women than a passenger train could haul
And that ain't all
I'd rather drink your muddy water, sleep down in a hollow log
I'd rather drink your muddy water, sleep down in a hollow log
Than to be in atlanta, georgia, treated like a dirty dog
Oh give me a t for texas, give me a t for tennessee
Give me a t for thelma, woman made a fool out of me
Give me a t for texas, give me that t for tennessee
Give me a t for thelma, woman made a fool out of me
One more time
Give me a t for thelma, oh that woman made a fool...
I said said oh, that woman made a fool
Out of me, yeah
