<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="If_I_Give_My_Soul">
(Get off stage, Cash. OK?)
Down a dangerous road, I have come to where I'm standing
With a heavy heart and my hat clutched in my hand
Such a foolish man, God ain't known no greater sinner
I have come in search of Jesus, hoping He will understand
If I give my soul, will He clean these clothes I'm wearin?
If I give my soul, will He put new boots on my feet?
If I bow my head and beg God for His forgiveness
Will He breathe new life within me and bring her back to me?
I had a woman once, she was kind and she was gentle
Had a child by me, who grew up to be a man
I had a steady job, 'til I started into drinking
Then I started making music travelin' with the devil's band
Oh the years went by like a mighty rush of eagles
Our dreams and plans were all scattered in the wind
And it's a lonesome life, when you lose the ones you live for
If I make my peace with Jesus will they take me back again?
If I give my soul, will he stop my hands from shaking?
If I give my soul, will my son love me again?
If I give my soul, and she knows i really mean it?
If I give my soul to Jesus will she take me back again?
If I give my soul, will He clean these clothes I'm wearin?
If I give my soul, will He put new boots on my feet?
If I bow my head and beg God for His forgiveness
Will He breathe new breath within me and bring her back to me?
