<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="San_Quentin_Number_2">
San Quentin, you've been livin' hell to me
You've scalded me since nineteen sixty three
I've seen 'em come and go and I've seen 'em die
And long ago I stopped askin' why
San Quentin, I hate every inch of you
You've cut me and have scarred me through and through
And I'll walk out a wiser weaker man
Mister Congressman why can't you understand
San Quentin, what good do you think you do?
Do you think I'll be different when you're through?
You bent my heart and mind, and you may my soul
Your stone walls turn my blood a little cold
San Quentin, may you rot and burn in hell
May your walls fall and may I live to tell
May all the world forget you ever stood
And the whole world regret you did no good
San Quentin, you've been livin' hell to me
