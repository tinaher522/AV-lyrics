<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="Single_Girl,_Married_Girl">
Single girl, oh, single girl
She's gone anywhere she please
Oh, gone anywhere she please
Married girl, oh, married girl
Got a baby on her knees
Oh, got a baby on her knees
Single girl, oh, single girl
She's going dressed up so fine
Oh, going dressed up so fine
Married girl, oh, married girl
She wears any kind
Oh, she wears any kind
Single girl, oh, single girl
She goes to the store and buys
Oh, goes to the store and buys
Married girl, oh, married girl
She rocks the cradle and cries
Oh, rocks the cradle and cries
Single girl, oh, single girl
She lays in bed 'til one
Oh, lays in bed 'til one
Married girl, oh, married girl
She's up before the sun
Oh, up before the sun
Single girl, oh, single girl
She's looking for a man
Oh, looking for a man
Married girl, oh, married girl
She's got her wedding band
Oh, got her wedding band
