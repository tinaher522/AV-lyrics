<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="I'm_Working_On_A_Building">
I'm a working on building
I'm a working on building
I'm a working on building
For my Lord, for my Lord
It's a holy ghost building
It's a holy ghost building
It's a holy ghost building
For my Lord, for my Lord
If I was a liar
I tell you what I would do
I'd quit my lying
And work on a building too
If I was a drunkard
I tell you what I would do
I'd quit my drinking
And work on a building too
If I was a gambler
I tell you what I would do
I'd quit my gambling
And work on a building too
If I was a preacher
I tell you what I would do
I would keep on preaching
And work on a building too
