<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="When_The_Roses_Bloom_Again">
In the rattle of the battle, came a whisper soft and low
From a soldier who'd been wounded in the fray
"I am dying, Captain, dying and I pray before I go
You will give your promise here I pass away"
Do not ask me dear to linger, for I know not what to say
When duty calls, just sweetheart's name in vain
I hope your heart will not be crying, if I'm not among the dying
I'll be with you when the roses bloom again
Yes, when the roses bloom again, beside the river
And the Robin Redbreast sings it's sweet refrain
As in days of Old Lang Syne, I'll be with you sweetheart mine
I'll be with you when the roses bloom again
Do not ask me dear to linger, for I know not what to say
When duty calls, just sweetheart's name in vain
I hope your heart will not be crying if I not among the dying
I'll be with you when the roses bloom again
When the roses bloom again beside the river
And the Robin Redbreast sings it's sweet refrain
As in days of Old Lang Syne, I'll be with you sweetheart mine
I'll be with you when the roses bloom again
