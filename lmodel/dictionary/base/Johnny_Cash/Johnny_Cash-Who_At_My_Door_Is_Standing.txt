<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="Who_At_My_Door_Is_Standing">
The times of loneliness, heartbreak
Despair and sadness
I've always found that a good song of inspiration
Lift me up, make me feel just a little bit better
Who at my door is standing
Patiently drawing near?
Entrance within demanding
Whose is the voice I hear?
Sweetly the tones are falling
Open the door for me
If thou wilt heed my calling
I will abide with thee
Who at my door is standing
Patiently drawing near?
Entrance within demanding
Whose is the voice I hear?
Sweetly the tones are falling
Open the door for me
If thou wilt heed my calling
I will abide with thee
