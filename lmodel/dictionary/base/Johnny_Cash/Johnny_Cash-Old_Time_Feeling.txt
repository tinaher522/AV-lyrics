<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="Old_Time_Feeling">
I could lie here forever, listen to the falling rain
I didn't think I would ever get touched this way again
Until you came, you smiled at me and rolled away the years
Back to a place there was time enough to love, love enough to give
You give me that old time feeling
You give me that old time feeling
We'll find a better place, a feeling that we can't erase
The rainbows that we chased will never end
We're coming close again
When your love lets me in
I don't know where I stop and you begin
You give me that old time feeling
In the early morning walking, I have you by my side
The morning breeze is blowing all the trouble from my mind
And when evening comes, we'll watch the moon ride easy in the sky
The way it used to be, that old way of loving is coming back to me
You give me that old time feeling
You give me that old time feeling
We'll find a better place, a feeling that we can't erase
The rainbows that we chased will never end
We're coming close again
When your love lets me in
I don't know where I stop and you begin
You give me that old time feeling
You give me that old time feeling
