<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="I_Do_Believe">
I do believe that I won't make it through the night
If you don't come on back to me and love me now
There ain't no way that I can say that it's all right
I do believe that you're not thinking anyhow
But I believe if you'll remember how it was a little while
If you'll recall that what we had was hard to beat
And I believe that if you'll meet me half way down that second mile
We will trade in all the bitter for the sweet
I do believe that you're not happy without me
I think you feel the way I'm feeling without you
Come on and give in to that feeling one more time
I do believe you won't regret it if you do
But I believe if you'll remember
