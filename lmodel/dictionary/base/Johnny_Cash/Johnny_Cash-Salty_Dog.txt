<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="Salty_Dog">
Standing on the corner with the lowdown blues
A great big hole in the bottom of my shoes
Honey let me be your salty dog
Let me be your salty dog
Or I won't be your little man at all
Honey let me be your salty dog
Look it here Sal, I know you
Run down stocking and a wore out shoe
Honey let me be your salty dog
Let me be your salty dog
Or I won't be your little man at all
Honey let me be your salty dog
Down in the wildwood sitting on a log
Finger on the trigger and an eye on the hog
Honey let me be your salty dog
Let me be your salty dog
Or I won't be your little man at all
Honey let me be your salty dog
Well I Pulled the trigger and the gun set go
The shot gun over in Mexico
Honey let me be your salty dog
Let me be your salty dog
Or I won't be your little man at all
Honey let me be your salty dog
Salty down now
Let me be your salty dog
Or I won't be your little man at all
Honey let me be your salty dog
Let me be your salty dog
Or I won't be your little man at all
Honey let me be your salty dog
