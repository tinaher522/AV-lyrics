An old cowboy went riding out one dark and windy day
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw
Plowing through the ragged skies and up a cloudy draw
Their brands were still on fire and their hooves were made of steel
Their horns were black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky
For he saw the riders coming hard and he heard their mournful cries
Yippie-i-oh
Yippie-i-ay
Ghost riders in the sky
Their faces gaunt, their eyes were blurred
Their shirts all soaked with sweat
He's riding hard to catch that herd
But he ain't caught 'em yet
Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky
On horses snorting fireâ€”as they ride on hear their cries
As the riders loped on by him, he heard one call his name
"If you wanna save your soul from hell a-riding on our range
Then, cowboy, change your ways today or with us you will ride
Trying to catch the devil's herd across these endless skies"
Yippie-i-oh
Yippie-i-ay
Ghost riders in the sky
Ghost riders in the sky
Ghost riders in the sky
