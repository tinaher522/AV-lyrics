<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="Don't_You_Think_It's_Come_Our_Time">
I have picked wild roses
Far into September
But I had no one to give the flowers to
I needed a celebration
A September coronation
And I admitted to myself I needed you
I've watched the gentle winds change
The colors shades of meadows
I've seen the dew on flowers that had no name
But I let my vase stay empty like my lonely empty heart
Picking flowers for yourself is not the same
Don't you think it's come our time to be together
Let's gather up our scattered words of love and make them rhyme
Let's go pick some flowers and fill our empty vases
Don't you think it's come out time
Would you take this small bouquet that leaves a fragrance on my fingers
And a feeling that your love is close at hand
Thank you for the flowers, now lets walk through the meadows
Through the brook where our demands caress the sand
Don't you think it's come our time to be together
Let's gather up our scattered words of love and make them rhyme
Let's go pick some flowers and fill our empty vases
Don't you think it's come out time
