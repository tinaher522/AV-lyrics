<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="I_Got_Stripes">
On a monday I was ar-rested (uh huh)
On a tuesday they locked me in the jail (oh boy)
On a wednesday my trial was at-tested
On a thursday they said guilty and the judge's gavel fell
I got stripes --- stripes around my shoulders
I got chains --- chains around my feet
I got stripes --- stripes around my shoulders
And them chains --- them chains they're about to drag me down
On a monday my momma come to see me
On a tuesday they caught me with a file
On a wednesday i'm down in solitary
On a thursday I start on bread and water for a while
I got stripes --- stripes around my shoulders
I got chains --- chains around my feet
I got stripes --- stripes around my shoulders
And them chains --- them chains they're about to drag me down
I got stripes --- stripes around my shoulders
I got chains --- chains around my feet
I got stripes --- stripes around my shoulders
And them chains --- them chains they're about to drag me
