<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="The_Man_On_The_Hill">
Will we get cold and hungry will times be very bad 
When we're needin' bread and meat where we gonna get it dad 
We'll get it from the man in the house on the hill 
Yes we will from the man on the hill 
Ploughin' time is over still the fields are bare 
How we gonna make a livin' with twenty acres to share 
I'll beg for more land from the man on the hill yes I will I'll ask the man on the hill 
I ain't got no Sunday shoes that I can wear to town 
Papa reckon the boss has got a pair of hand-me-downs 
I'll go and ask the man in the house on the hill yes I will I'll ask the man on the hill 
Maybe he will help us maybe we'll get by 
But who's gonna pay the dyin' bills if we all should die 
We'll leave it to the man in the sky when we die 
Yes we'll leave it to the man in the sky
