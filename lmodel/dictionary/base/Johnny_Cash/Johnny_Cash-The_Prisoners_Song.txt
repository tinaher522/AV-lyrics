<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="The_Prisoners_Song">
Oh I wish I had someone to love me, Yes someone to call me their own
Oh I wish I had someone to live with, 'Cause I'm tired of living all alone
Please meet me tonight in the moonlight
Please meet me tonight all alone
For I have a sad story to tell you
It's a story that's never been told
(I'll be carried to the new jail tomorrow
Leaving my poor ol' darling alone)
With the cold prison bars all around me
And my head on a pillow of stone
Now I have a grand ship out on the ocean
All mounted with silver and gold
And before my poor darling would suffer
That ship would be anchored and sold
Now if I had the wings of an angel
Over these prison walls I would fly
And I'd fly to the arms of my poor darling
And there I'd be willing to die
