<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="Get_Rhythm">
Hey, get rhythm!
When you get the blues!
C'mon get rhythm!
When you get the blues!
Get a rock and roll feeling in your bones,
Put taps on your toes, and get goin'
Get rhythm!
When you get the blues!
A little shoe-shine boy he never gets low-down,
But he's got the dirtiest job in town!
Bending low at the peoples' feet,
On a windy corner of a dirty street.
Well, I asked him while she shined my shoes,
How'd he keep from getting the blues.
He grinned as he raised his little head,
He popped a shoe-shine rag, and he said
Get rhythm!
When you get the blues!
C'mon get rhythm!
When you get the blues!
A jumpy rhythm makes you feel so fine,
It'll shake all your troubles from your worried mind.
Get rhythm!
When you get the blues!
Get rhythm!
When you get the blues!
C'mon get rhythm!
When you get the blues!
Get a rock and roll feeling in your bones,
Put taps on your toes, and get goin'
Get rhythm!
When you get the blues!
Well, I had to listen to the shoe-shine boy,
And I thought I was gonna jump for joy!
Slapped on the shoe polish left and right,
He took a shoe-shine rag and he held it tight.
He stopped once to wipe the sweat away,
I said, you're a mighty little boy to be a-workin' that way!
He said I like it, with a big wide grin,
Kept on a-poppin' and he said again,
Get rhythm!
When you get the blues!
C'mon get rhythm!
When you get the blues!
It only costs a dime, just a nickel a shoe.
It does a million dollars worth of good for you.
Get rhythm!
When you get the blues!
