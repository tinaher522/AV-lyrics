<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="Frankie_And_Johnny">
Framkie and Johnny were sweethearts
Lordy how they did love
They swore to be true to each other
As true as the stars above
He was her man
He wouldn't do her wrong
Franke went down to the corner
Just t get a bucket of beer
She said "Mr. Bartender
Has my lovin' Johnny been here?
He's my man, he wouldn't do me wrong"
I ain't gonna tell you no story
I ain't gonna tell you no lie
Johnny left here 'bout an hour ago
With a gal named Nellie Bly
If he's your man, he's doin' you wrong
Frankie looked over the transom
And much to her surprise
There on a cot sat Johnny
Making love to Nellie Bly
She said "He's my man
But he's doin' me wrong"
Roll out your rubber tired buggy
Roll out your rubber tired hack
She's taking her man to the graveyard
But she ain't gonna bring him back
She shot her man
Because he was doin' her wrong
This story has no moral
This story has no end
This story goes to show
That you can't put your trust in men
She shot her man
Because he was doin' her wrong
