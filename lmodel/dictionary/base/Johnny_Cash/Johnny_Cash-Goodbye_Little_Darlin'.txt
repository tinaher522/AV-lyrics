<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="Goodbye_Little_Darlin'">
Goodbye little darlin', we're parted
Parting don't always mean goodbye
Although we had to part you're always in my heart
Goodbye little darlin', goodbye
Goodbye little darlin', I'll miss you
Miss you like the stars would miss the sky
I hate to see you go, I'm gonna miss you
So goodbye little darlin', goodbye
Goodbye little darlin', I love you
I'll love you until the day I die
Will you dream a dream of me wherever you may be
Goodbye little darlin', goodbye
