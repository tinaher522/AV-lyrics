<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="Understand_Your_Man">
Don't call my name out your window, I'm leavin'
I won't even turn my head
Don't send your kin folk to give me no talkin'
I'll be gone like I said
You'd say the same ole things that you've been sayin' all along
Lay there in your bed and keep you mouth shut 'till I'm gone
Don't give me that old familiar, "cry n' cuss n' moan"
Understand Your Man (I'm tired of your bad mouthin')
Understand Your Man
You can give my other suit to the Salvation Army 
And everything else I leave behind
I ain't takin' nothin' that'll slow down my travelin'
While I'm untangling my mind
I ain't gonna repeat what I said anymore
While I'm breathin' air that ain't been breathed before
I'll be as gone as a wild goose in winter
Then you'll Understand Your Man (meditate on it)
Understand Your Man (You hear me talkin, now?)
Understand Your Man 
Understand Your Man
