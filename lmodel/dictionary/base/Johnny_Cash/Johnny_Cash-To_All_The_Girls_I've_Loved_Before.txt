<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="To_All_The_Girls_I've_Loved_Before">
And to all the girls I've loved before
Who traveled in and out my door
I'm glad they came along, I dedicate the song
To all the girls I've loved before
And to all the girls I once caressed
And may I say I've held the best
They live within my heart, they'll always be a part
To all the girls I've loved before
The winds of change are always blowing
Every time I try to stay
The winds of change continue blowing
And they just carry me away
To all the girls who shared my life
Who now are someone else's wives
For helping me to grow, I owe a lot I know
To all the girls I've loved before
The winds of change are always blowing
Every time I try to stay
The winds of change continue blowing
And they just carry me away
To all the girls I've loved before
Who traveled in and out my door
I'm glad they came along, I dedicate the song
To all the girls I've loved before
