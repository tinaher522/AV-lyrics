<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="I_Promise_You">
I promised you the day you marry me
I'll be everything to you that I should be
And while you're in the springtime of your years
You'll not know what it's like to shed a tear
I'll be the same through all that we go through
I promise you I promise you
I promise you for richer or for poorer
I'll more than share each pain that you endure
And when you're in the autumn of your years
You'll call me in the night and I'll be near
I love you and I'll let you know I do
I promise you I promise you
I promise you for better or for worse
I'll stand by you as I did at the first
And when you're in the winter of your years
I'll be right by your side to dry your tears
Yes I'll be the same through all that we go through
I promise you I promise you
I promise you I promise you
