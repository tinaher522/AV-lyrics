<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="White_Lightning">
Well in North Carolina, way back in the hills
Me and my old pappy had a hand in a still
We brewed white lightnin' 'til the sun went down
Then he'd fill him a jug and he'd pass it around
Mighty, mighty pleasin', pappy's corn squeezin'
Whshhhoooh... white lightning
[Chorus]
Well the "G" men, "T" men, revenuers, too
Searchin' for the place where he made his brew
They were looking, tryin to book him,
But my pappy kept cookin'
Whshhhoooh... white lightning
Well I asked my old pappy why he called his brew
White lightning 'stead of mountain dew
I took a little sip and right away I knew
As my eyes bugged out and my face turned blue
Lightning started flashin' and thunder started crashin'
Shhhoooh... white lightnin'
[Chorus]
Well the "G" men, "T" men, revenuers, too
Searchin' for the place where he made his brew
They were looking, tryin to book him,
But my pappy kept a-cookin'
Whshhhoooh . . . white lightning
Well a city slicker came and he said "I'm tough"
I think I want to taste that powerful stuff
He took one g-g-glug and drank it right down
And I heard him a moaning as he hit the ground
Mighty, mighty pleasin', pappy's corn squeezin'
Whshhhoooh... white lightning
[Chorus]
Well the "G" men, "T" men, revenuers, too
Searchin' for the place where he made his brew
They were looking, tryin' to book him,
But my pappy kept cookin'
Whshhhoooh... white lightning...
