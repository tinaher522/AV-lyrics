<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="My_Clinch_Mountain_Home">
Far away upon a hill on a sunny mountain side
Many years ago we parted, my own true love and I
From the sunny mountain side
Oh she clung to me and trembled, when I told her we must part
And she said don't go my darling I know twill break my heart
When we two are far apart
Carry me back to old Virginia back to my clinch mountain home
Carry me back to old Virginia back to my old mountain home
My mother's old and feeble and my father's getting gray
Carry me back to old Virginia for its there I want to stay
Oh I held her in my arms leaned her head upon my breast
And I told her that I'd wed her when I come back from the west
To my old clinch mountain home
In my hand I hold a picture of the old home far away
And the picture of my sweetheart
I'm thinking of today
On the sunny mountain side
