<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="Lord,_Lord,_Lord">
Lord , Lord , Lord, is there a place for me
In the scheme of things, in the service of the King
Lord , Lord , Lord, there is no job too great
As I grow in faith, there,s no job too great
Lord , Lord , Lord, there is no road too long
'Cause you made me strong, there's no road too long
Lord , Lord , Lord, there,s no stream too wide
With you by my side, there,s no stream too wide
Let me help someone thru the darkest hour
Let me shine , shine , shine, like the beacon's tower
Let my light be strong and myself be small
Let me know the truth that I'm one with all
Lord , Lord , Lord, there's no job too small
'Cause I,m one with all, there's no job too small
Lord , Lord , Lord, is there a place for me
In the scheme of things, in the service of the King
Lord , Lord , Lord, there is no job too great
As I grow in faith, there's no job too great
Lord , Lord , Lord , Lord oh Lord , Lord , Lord
Lord oh Lord, Lord , Lord , Lord, oh Lord , Lord , Lord
Lord , Lord , Lord
