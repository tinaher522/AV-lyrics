<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="The_Sound_Of_Laughter">
I stood in there in the shadows
As they went strolling by
Now she ain't my girl no longer
There's no reason I should cry
But I knew there went my future
And I couldn't stop the tears
And the sound of laughter
Ringing in my ears
I spent every dime I had on her
And when it was gone
She said, "Hun, it's sure been fun
But it's time you moved along"
So I stood there in the shadows
And I had my .44
I could hear her mocking laughter
But she won't laugh anymore
Now I'm down here in the gaol house
And I know what brought me here
It was the sound of laughter
Ringing in my ears
Well, I guess, I should have left this town
And her far behind
For the way that she made fun of me
Keeps running through my mind
Well, the jury showed no mercy
And I never asked for none
'Cause I know I've got it coming
I'm not proud of what I've done
But down here in this darkness
More and more I seem to hear
The sound of laughter
Ringing in my ears
I hear the sound of laughter
Ringing in my ear
