Well a man walked down by Galilee so the Holy Book does say 
And a great multitude was gathered there without a thing to eat for days 
Up stepped a little boy with the basket please take it Lord he said 
And with just a five loaves and two little fishes five thousand had fish and bread 
Who was it everybody (it was Jesus) who was it everybody (it was Jesus) 
Who was it everybody (it was Jesus) it was Jesus Christ our Lord 
Now pay close attention little children it's somebody you ought to know 
It's all about a man that walked on earth nearly two thousand years ago 
Well he healed the sick and afflicted it and he raised 'em from the dead 
Then they nailed him on an old rugged cross and put thorns on his head 
Who was it everybody... 
Well they took him down and they buried him and after the third day 
When they came to his tomb where they knew he was gone 
Cause the stone was rolled away 
He's not here for he is risen the angel of the Lord then said 
And when they saw him walking with these nail-scared hands 
They knew he came back from the dead 
Who was it everybody...
