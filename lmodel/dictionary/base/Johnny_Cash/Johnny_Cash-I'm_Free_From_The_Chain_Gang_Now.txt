<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="I'm_Free_From_The_Chain_Gang_Now">
I got rid of the shackles that bound me and the guards that were always around me 
There were tears on the mail mother wrote me in jail 
But I'm free from the chain gang now 
All the years I was known and respected till one day I was wrongly suspected 
I was shackled in chains in a cold freezin' rain but I'm free from the chain gang now 
All the years I was known by a number how I kept my mind is a wonder 
But like a bird in a tree I got my liberty and I'm free from the chain gang now
I got rid of the shackles that bound me and the guards that were always around me 
There were tears on the mail mother sent me in jail 
But I'm free from the chain gang now
There were tears on the mail mother sent me in jail 
But I'm free from the chain gang now.
