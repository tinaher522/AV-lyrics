<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="(I_Heard_That)_Lonesome_Whistle">
I was riding number nine 
Heading south from Caroline
I heard that loh-oh-oh-nesome whistle blow
I got a trouble, had to roam
I left my gal, I left my home
I heard that loh-oh-oh-nesome whistle blow
Just a kid acting smart 
I went and broke my darling's heart
I guess I was too young to know
They took me off to Georgia Main
Locked me to a ball and chain
I heard that loh-oh-oh-nesome whistle blow
All alone, I bear the shame
I'm a number, not a name
I heard that loh-oh-oh-nesome whistle blow
All I do is sit and cry
When that evening train goes by
I heard that loh-oh-oh-nesome whistle blow
I'll be locked here in this cell 
'til my body's just a shell
And my hair turns whiter than snow
I'll never see that gal of mine 
I'm in Georgia doing time
I heard that loh-oh-oh-nesome whistle blow
