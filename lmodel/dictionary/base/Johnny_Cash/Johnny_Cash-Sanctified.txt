<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="Sanctified">
Have a little drink
No thank you brother 
Do you want to get rich? 
Don't need it brother 
Wanna fool around 
No thank you sister 
Ain't you heard that old evil man within me died 
Let's have a party 
I ain't going what you gonna do 
I'm gonna keep praying 
And keep working out my salvation 
Trying to sanctified 
No more condemnation 
Repented Jesus brought salvation 
He saved me
Justification brought me safely to his side 
And as I get to know him more 
He gives me a taste of the coming glory 
And I'm trying to whip the devil 
Trying to get sanctified 
Sanctified, sanctified 
I'm working to whip the devil 
I'm trying to get sanctified
Don't go to church 
Yes I'm going 
Why you read that old Bible? 
Cause I like it

Well I don't believe in god 
Well God bless you 
You ain't got no argument 
For what I feel inside 
Aww, have a little fun 
That's what I'm having 
Life's passing you by 
I can hardly wait 
I've got my mind set on Eternity 
Trying to get sanctified 
And there's no more condemnation 
Repented Jesus brought salvation
He saved me
Justification brought me safely to his side 
And as I get to know him more 
He gives me a taste of the coming glory 
And I'm trying to whip the devil 
Trying to get sanctified 
Sanctified, (sanctified) 
Sanctified, sanctified 
Yes I'm trying to whip the devil 
I'm trying to get sanctified 
Sanctified, sanctified  
Sanctified, sanctified 
I'm working out my salvation trying to get sanctified 
Sanctified
