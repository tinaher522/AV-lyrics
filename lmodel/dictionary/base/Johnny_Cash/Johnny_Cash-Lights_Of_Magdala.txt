<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="Lights_Of_Magdala">
Oh, the lights of magdala flicker dimly on the shore
Holy sailor sailing on the sea
Patiently waiting she was quietly to the door
Another lonely night in galilee
Magdalene, don't wrap your dreams in sorrow
Save them for morrow if it comes
When we'll meet within the circle round the sun
If heaven were a lady don't you know you have been the one
To the streets of jerusalem you followed him once more
Your holy sailor's come home from the sea
The somewhere someone's calling you to a distant golden shore
Far from the lonely nights in galilee
Magdalene, don't wrap your dreams in sorrow
Save them for morrow if it comes
When we'll meet within circle round the sun
If heaven were a lady I know you'd been the one
