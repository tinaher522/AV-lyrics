<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="Why_Me_Lord">
Why me, Lord, what have I ever done 
To deserve even one
Of the blessings I've known
Why me, Lord, what did I ever do
That was worth love from you
And the kindness you've shown
Lord, help me, Jesus, I've wasted it so
Help me, Jesus, I know what I am
Now that I know that I've need you so
Help me, Jesus, my soul's in your hand
Try me, Lord, if you think there's a way
That I can repay what I've taken from you
Maybe, Lord, I could show someone else
What I've been through myself on my way back to you
Lord, help me, Jesus, I've wasted it so
Help me, Jesus, I know what I am
Now that I know that I've need you so
Help me, Jesus, my soul's in your hand
Jesus, my soul's in your hand
