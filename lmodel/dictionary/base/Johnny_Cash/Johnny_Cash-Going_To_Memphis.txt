<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="Going_To_Memphis">
Bring a drink of water Leroy bring a drink of water (no) 
If I could get to mercy man he's give me some I know 
I got a gal in Vickburg Bertha is her name 
Wish I's tied to Bertha instead of this ball and chain 
I'm goin' to Memphis (that's right Lord) yeah (uh huh) 
But dues took all my money wouldn't let me see the cards 
I owen the boss about a hundred years for sleepin' in his backyard 
I'm goin' to Memphis (yeah Memphis) yeah I'm goin' to Memphis (now) 
Like a bitter weed I'm a bad seed but when that levee's thru and I am too 
Let the honky tonk roll on come mornin' I'll be gone 
I'm goin' to Memphis yeah Memphis 
I never been to Chicago but it must be a mighty fine place (that's right) 
I couldn't get past Tennessee with Mississippi all over my face (uh huh) 
I'm goin' to Memphis (that's right Lord Memphis) 
Well the freezin' ground at night is my own foldin' bed 
Polk salad is my bread and meat and it will be till I'm dead 
Well I brought me a little water in a Mr Prince Albert can 
But the bossman caught me drinkin' it and I believe he broke my hand (hm hm) 
They all call me crazy for sassin' Mr Scott 
My brother was killed for a deed I did but I disremember what (yeah) 
Well another boy is down the shovel burned him out 
Let me stand on his body to see what the shoutin's about 
I'm goin' to Memphis yeah I'm goin' to Memphis hmm 
Like a bitter weed...
