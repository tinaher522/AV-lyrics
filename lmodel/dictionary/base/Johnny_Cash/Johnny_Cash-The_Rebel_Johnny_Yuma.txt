<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="The_Rebel_Johnny_Yuma">
Away, away, away he rode
The rebel Johnny Yuma
Johnny Yuma was a rebel
He roamed through the West
Did Johnny Yuma, the rebel
He wandered alone
He got fightin' mad, this rebel lad
He packed no star as he wandered far
Where the only law was a hook and a draw
The rebel, Johnny Yuma
(Away, away, away he rode the rebel)
Johnny Yuma was a rebel
He roamed through the West
Did Johnny Yuma, the rebel
He wandered alone
He searched the land, this restless lad
He was panther quick and leather tough
If he figured that he'd been pushed enough
The rebel, Johnny Yuma
(Away, away, away he rode the rebel)
(Johnny Yuma, Johnny Yuma)
Johnny Yuma was a rebel
He roamed through the west
Did Johnny Yuma, the rebel
He wandered alone
Fightin' mad this rebel lad
With a dream he'd hold till his dyin' breath
He'd search his soul and gamble with death
The rebel, Johnny Yuma
(Away, away, away he rode the rebel)
(Johnny Yuma, Johnny Yuma)
