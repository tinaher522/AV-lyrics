<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="I'm_So_Lonesome_I_Could_Cry">
Hear that lonesome whippoorwill?
He sounds too blue to fly.
The midnight train is whining low: 
I'm so lonesome I could cry.
I've never seen a night so long,
When time goes crawling by.
The moon just went behind a cloud,
To hide its face and cry.
Did you ever see a Robin weep,
When leaves begin to die?
That means he's lost the will to live.
I'm so lonesome I could cry.
The silence of a falling star, 
Lights up a purple sky.
And as I wonder where you are,
I'm so lonesome I could cry.
I'm so lonesome I could cry.
