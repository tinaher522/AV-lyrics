(Praises sing to Christ the King and peace to men on earth) 
On Christmas Eve I dreamed I traveled all around the earth 
And in my dream I saw and heard the ways the different people hail the king 
Whose star shone in the east and what a dream it was 
In London Town I walked around Piccadilly Circus 
A mass of people movin' here and there I wandered where 
On every face at every place was hurry up I'm late 
But a kind old man at a chestnut stand said merry Christmas mate 
And I felt the Christmas spirit 
In a little town nestled down in Bavaria Germany 
I walked along to see what the feeling there would be 
And here again was the busy din the rushin' the yellin' 
But some kind boy said Frohliche Weihnachten 
Not undesratnding the words but gettin' the buyin' and sellin' 
I felt the Christmas spirit 
In Bethlehem I heard a hymn some distant choir sang 
And with other tourists I walked along to a church as its bells rang 
Then I heard someone tell someone there's where Christ was born 
I wonder if he looked like our baby looked on that first morn 
And then I really felt the Christmas spirit 
From a businessman in the Holy Land as a sidewalk souvenirshop 
I bought a little Bible since I'd hardly stopped 
And it was in Paris France somehow by chance that I took the Bible out 
And as I flipped the pages I saw these words and I knew what it was all about 
For I read fear not for behold I bring you good tidings of great joy 
Which shall be to all people 
For unto you he was born this day in the City of David a Saviour 
Which is Christ the Lord 
Then I took the little Holy Book held it close and tight 
I closed my eyes and visualized the glory of that night 
So suddenly it came to me for when I awoke on Christmas Day 
I felt the Christmas spirit down deep inside to stay 
(O little town of Bethlehem how still we see Thee lie 
Above Thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by 
Yet in Thy dark streets shineth the everlasting light 
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in Thee tonight)
