<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="Supper_Time">
Many years ago in days of childhood
I used to play till evening time would come
Still winding down that old familiar pathway
I hear my mother call at setting sun
Come home, come home, it's supper time
The shadows lengthen so fast
Come home, come home, it's supper time
We're going home at last
Some of the fondest memories of my childhood
Are woven around supper time
When mother used to call from
The back steps of the old homeplace
Come on home now, son, it's supper time
How I'd love to hear that once again
But you know time has woven for me a realization
Of a truth that's even more thrilling
That someday we'll be called up
To gather around the supper table up there
For the greatest supper time of them all
With our Lord
I can almost hear the call now
Comin' from the portals of Heaven
Come home son, it's supper time
Come home, come home, it's supper time
The shadows lengthen fast
Come home, come home, it's supper time
We're going home at last
