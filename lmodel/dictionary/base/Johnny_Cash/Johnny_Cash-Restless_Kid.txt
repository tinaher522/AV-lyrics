<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="Restless_Kid">
I came in like a restless wind
On a wagon train
But I'm gonna go like a July snow
Back to where I came from
Gonna leave this humdrum
It's too slow and tame
None of your business where I've been
Don't ask me what I've done
Run your ranch and punch your cows
And stay behind my gun man
Colorado's right hand will put you on the run
I got a gal in Denver town
That's crying over me
But I said goodbye and I let her cry
I miss her company but
I'll get out of this rut
Rio Bravo's killing me
They got a man locked in a cell
That's a freer man than I
He's gonna laugh right in their face
When they lead him out to die and
He's gonna leave these badlands
And ride off in the sky
You're gonna see old Colorado
Headin' for the door
You better believe I'm gonna leave
Like the 904 train
Gonna breathe some air again
That ain't been breathed before
