<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="What_Is_Man">
What is man that you are mindful of him, Lord
You made the stars you made the sun
And all the worlds that came to be at your command
What is man? What has he done?
Then you crown him with glory and with honor
Give him dominion over land and sea and air
And store up an inheritance in heaven
O what is man that you would care
What is man that you would let him live at all
to shed the blood of his own kind
And ever fail to even follow where you call
What is man? Why do you mind?
Yet you crown me with glory and with honor
Give me dominion over land and sea and air
And store up my inheritance in heaven
O what is man, that you care?
What is man, Lord, that you would care?
