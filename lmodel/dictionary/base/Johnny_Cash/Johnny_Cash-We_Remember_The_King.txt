<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="We_Remember_The_King">
As The Strippers,
Flyin through the valley,
Is that friend in memory we made, 
Is a true friend we have lost, 
WE REMEMBER THE KING.
WE REMEMBER,WE REMEMBER THE KING
WE RECALL, WE RECALL EVERYTHING,
WE WILL TREASURE ALL OF THE GIFTS,
THAT HE DID BRING
WE REMEMBER THE KING.
