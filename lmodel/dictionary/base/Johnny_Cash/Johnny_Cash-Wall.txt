<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="Wall">
There's a lot of strange men in cell block ten
But the strangest of them all
Was a friend of mine who spent his time
Staring at the wall
Staring at the wall
In his hand was a note that his gal had wrote
Proving crime don't pay
Was the very same gal he robbed and stole for
Naming her wedding day
Naming her wedding day
As he looked at the wall
So strong and tall
I could hear him softly curse
Nobody at all ever climbed that wall
But I'm gonna be the first
I'm gonna be the first
Then the warden walked by and said son don't try
I'd hate to see you fall
Cause there ain't no doubt they'll carry you out
If you ever touch that wall
If you ever touch that wall
Well a years gone by since he made his try
But I can still recall
How hard he tried and the way he died
But he never made that wall
He never made that wall
There's never been a man ever shook this can
But I knew a man who tried
The newspapers called it a jailbreak plan
But I know it was suicide
I know it was suicide
