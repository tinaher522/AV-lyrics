<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="The_Little_Drummer_Boy">
Come they told me our newborn King to see 
Our finest gifts we bring to lay before the King 
This is to honor him when we come 
Baby Jesus I am a poor boy too I have no gift to bring that's fit to give a King 
But may I play for you on my drum 
The mother Mary nodded the ox and lamb kept time 
I played my drum for him I played my best for him 
Then he smiled at me me and my drum
