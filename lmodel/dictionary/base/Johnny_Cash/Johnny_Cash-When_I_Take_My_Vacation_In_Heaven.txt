<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="When_I_Take_My_Vacation_In_Heaven">
There are those who are taking vacations to the mountains the lakes and the sea 
Where they rest from their cares and their troubles 
What a wonderful time that must be 
But it seems not my lot to be like them I must toil through the heat and the cold 
Seekin' out the lost sheep on the mountains bringing wanderers back to the fold 
But when I take my vacation in heaven what a wonderful time that will be 
Hearing concerts by the heavenly chorus and the face of my Saviour I'll see 
Sitting down on the banks of the river neath the shade of the evergreen tree 
There I'll rest from my burdens forever won't you take your vacation with me 
(Sitting down on the banks of the river under the shade of the evergreen tree) 
There I'll rest from my burdens forever won't you take your vacation with me
