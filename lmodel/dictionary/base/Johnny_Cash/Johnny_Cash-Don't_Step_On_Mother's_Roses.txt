<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="Don't_Step_On_Mother's_Roses">
We all were called to come back to the old home on the farm 
Mother's passed away what a mournful day 
And as my daddy watched his eyes were filled with pain and hurt 
When someone stepped upon a rose and crush it in the dirt 
Don't step on mother's roses daddy cried she planted them the day she was my bride 
And everytime I see a rose I see her smilin' face 
She made my darkest days look bright round the old homeplace 
Don't step on mother's roses let them grow 
The way they did since many years ago 
They'll bloom for me each year and I'll have mother near 
Don't step on mother's roses let them grow 
Years have passed away and how the old homeplace has changed 
Daddy had to go we all miss him so 
Children pick the roses as they go along the way 
But when their petals are abused I hear my daddy say 
Don't step on mother's roses...
