<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="I_Can't_Go_On_That_Way">
Life was a bottle of alcohol
And pills and blues and gals
And every hung over mornin'
Was an unheeded warnin'
That I shared with my lost pals
And the music flowed
And my chosen road grew wider everyday
Till the highs got low and the will said no
I can't go on that way
Can't go that way, can't go that way
Yes, the highs got low and the will said no
I can't go on that way
Sugar is sweet and good prime meat
Is so hard to come by
Saccharine is 'round again
But today it's do or die
My baby is home where I belong
And this is still my day
I am hangin' on and I am comin' on strong
And I can't go on that way
Can't go that way, can't go that way
I am still hangin' on and comin' on strong
And I can't go on that way
Earth is down and next time around
I ain't goin' round again
When it comes my time, I'm gonna stop at a line
And forget where I've been
Who was it said that a life is dead
Like the summer's day
Just let her go and let a new wind blow
'Cause I can't go on that way
Can't go that way, can't go that way
Just let her go and let a new wind blow
'Cause I can't go on that way
