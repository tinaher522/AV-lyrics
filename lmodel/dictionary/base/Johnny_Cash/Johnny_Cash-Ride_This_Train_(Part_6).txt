Ride this train to any country fair in this land now here's a hard working happy people 
Mrs Jones baked the finest pie for the contest this year 
And Mr Brown's got the biggest fattest old sow you ever saw 
And all the kids are eatin' popcorn and cotton candy 
This is Chester South Carolina and that year at the fair 
My papa brought us all down in a wagon 
And on the way down we picked up another family that lived up the creek 
I was just a little boy but I remember I kept askin' papa 
How much farther is it how much farther is it 
We had a young haffa tied to the wagon that papa just knew 
Was gonna take first prize 
I didn't have no doubt about that haffa winning first prize 
But the main thing I was interested in 
Was somethin' else papa had under his seat at the front of the wagon 
And that was an old dobro that I thought papa played like nobody else in the world 
I guess by real musical standards papa didn't know much about music 
But I tell you that night at the fair when he played in the dance band 
I just had to stay awake sat up there and listen to papa play the dobro
