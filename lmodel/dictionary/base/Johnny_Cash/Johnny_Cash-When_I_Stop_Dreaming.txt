<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="When_I_Stop_Dreaming">
The worst that I've ever been hurt in my life 
the first time I ever have wanted to die 
was the night when you told me you loved someone else 
and you asked me if I could forget 
When I stop dreaming that's when I'll stop loving you 
You may teach the flowers to bloom in the snow 
you may take a pebble and teach it to grow 
you may teach all the raindrops to return to the cloud 
but you can't teach my heart to forget 
When I stop dreaming that's when I'll stop loving you
