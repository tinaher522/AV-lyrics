<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="Silver_Haired_Daddy_Of_Mine">
In a vine covered shack in the mountains
Bravely fighting the battle of time
There's a dear one who's weathered life sorrows
It's that silver haired daddy of mine
If I could recall all the heartaches
Dear old daddy, I've caused you to bear
If I could erase those lines from your face
And bring back the gold to your hair
If God would but grant me the power
Just to turn back the pages of time
I would give all I own, if I could but atone
To that silver haired daddy of mine
If I could recall all the heartaches
Dear old daddy, I've caused you to bear
If I could erase those lines from your face
And bring back the gold to your hair
If God would but grant me the power
Just to turn back the pages of time
I would give all I own, if I could but atone
To that silver haired daddy of mine
