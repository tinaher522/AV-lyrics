<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="Ole_Slew_Foot">
High on the mountain what do I see
There's bear tracks bear tracks lookin' back at me
You better get your rifle boys before it's too late
That bear's got a little pig and headed for the gate
He's bigger around the middle and he's broad across the rump
Runnin' ninety miles an hour takin' forty feet jumps
Ain't never been caught he ain't never been treat
Some folks say he looks a lot like me
Well I got me some money and I got me some bees
And they started makin' honey way up in the trees
I chopped down the trees cause my honey's all gone
Old Slew foot's done made himself at home
He's bigger around the middle and he's broad across the rump
Runnin' ninety miles an hour takin' forty feet jumps
Ain't never been caught he ain't never been treat
Some folks say he looks a lot like me
Some folks say he looks a lot like daddy
Winter's comin' on and it's forty below
The river's frozen over so where can he go
I'd get me a rifle boys and run him in the well
Then I shoot him in the bottom just to hear him yell
He's bigger around the middle and he's broad across the rump
Runnin' ninety miles an hour takin' forty feet jumps
Ain't never been caught he ain't never been treat
Some folks say he looks a lot like me
Some folks say he looks a lot like my Johnny
