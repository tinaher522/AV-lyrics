Way up north
(North To Alaska)
Way up north
(North To Alaska)
North to Alaska
They're goin' North, the rush is on
North to Alaska
They're goin' North, the rush is on
Big Sam left Seattle
In the year of '92
With George Pratt, his partner
And brother, Billy, too
They crossed the Yukon River
And found the bonanza gold
Below that old white mountain
Just a little south-east of Nome
Sam crossed the majestic mountains
To the valleys far below
He talked to his team of huskies
As he mushed on through the snow
With the northern lights a-running wild
In the land of the midnight sun
Yes, Sam McCord was a mighty man
In the year of nineteen-one
Where the river is winding
Big nuggets they're finding
North to Alaska
They're goin' North, the rush is on
Way up north
(North To Alaska)
Way up north
(North To Alaska)
North to Alaska
They're goin' North, the rush is on
North to Alaska
They're goin' North, the rush is on
George turned to Sam
With his gold in his hand
Said, "Sam, you're a-lookin'
At a lonely, lonely man"
"I'd trade all the gold
That's buried in this land
For one small band of gold
To place on sweet little Ginnie's hand"
"'Cause a man needs a woman
To love him all the time
Remember, Sam
A true love is so hard to find"
"I'd build for my Ginnie
A honeymoon home
Below that old white mountain
Just a little south-east of Nome"
Where the river is winding
Big nuggets they're finding
North to Alaska
They're goin' North, the rush is on
North to Alaska
They're goin' North, the rush is on
Way up north
(North To Alaska)
Way up north
(North To Alaska)
Way up north
(North To Alaska)
