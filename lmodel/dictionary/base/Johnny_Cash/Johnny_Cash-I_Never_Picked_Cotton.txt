<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="I_Never_Picked_Cotton">
I never picked cotton
Like my mother did and my brother did and my sister did
And my daddy died young workin' in a coal mine
When I was just a baby, too little for the cotton sack
I played in the dirt while the others worked
Till they couldn't straighten up their backs
And I made myself a promise when I was old enough to run
That I'd never stay a single day in that Oklahoma sun, but
I never picked cotton
Like my mother did and my brother did and my sister did
And my daddy died young workin' in a coal mine
Folks said that I grew up early and the farm couldn't hold me then
So I stole ten bucks and a pickup truck and I never went back again
And it was fast cars and whiskey, long-legged girls and fun
I had everything that money could bring and I took it all with a gun,
but
I never picked cotton
Like my mother did and my brother did and my sister did
And my daddy died young workin' in a coal mine
It was Saturday night in Memphis when a redneck grabbed my shirt
He said go back to your cotton sack, I left him lyin' in the dirt
And they'll take me in the morning to gallows just outside
And in the time I got there ain't a heck of a lot I can look back on with pride,
But
I never picked cotton
Like my mother did and my brother did and my sister did
And my daddy died young workin' in a coal mine
