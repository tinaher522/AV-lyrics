Spoken
We're on the Mount of Olives now, just outside the gate of the Garden of Gethsemane: where Jesus prayed, where he sweated blood, where he was betrayed, denied and finally at this place he was arrested.
We're entering at the gate now, at the Garden of Gethsemane. That's an olive trees. Beautiful flowers, it's a very beautiful place, where Christ often came to pray, to meditate. Olive trees probably two thousand years old or more.
And there's a possibility, and a very strong possibility, that beneath or around some of these very same olive trees, Jesus himself sat or stood with his disciples. You know, Jesus knew his divine purpose right from the very beginning. And that last night of his life, here at the Garden of Gethsemane, he knew that his hour had come. He was born human, just like any others, and he didn't want to die. He prayed, and a matter of fact he prayed to be spared the death that he knew was very near.
Here, within a very few feet of where I'm standing, Jesus did, and when they came to arrest him, he said, "I am he whom you seek," and they took him away.
If Jesus had not had a divine purpose in dying, he would through his divine power could have been delivered, as it's indicated he delivered Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego from the fiery furnace. Many, many years before the time of Christ came Nebuchadnezzar, looked into the fiery furnace and saw that the three men were walkin' around in the fire, and he said of a spirit that was there protecting them, "The form of the fourth is like the Son of God."
