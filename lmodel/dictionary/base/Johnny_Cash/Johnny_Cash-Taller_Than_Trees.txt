<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="Taller_Than_Trees">
On your knees you are taller than trees you can look over heartaches and pain 
When my faith is gone to my knees I will go growing stronger and taller than trees 
One night it was a long time ago now I knelt at my mother's knee 
And she said son lift up your eyes to him in the skies 
And you'll grow like the mighty oaks 
But you son created in image of God can become taller than the tallest trees 
And this was the answer I felt as down at her knees I knelt 
On your knees you're taller than trees 
You can look over all your heartaches and son you can look over all of your pains 
When my faith is gone to my knees I will go growing stronger and taller than trees
