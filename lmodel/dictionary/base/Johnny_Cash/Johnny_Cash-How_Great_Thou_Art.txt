<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="How_Great_Thou_Art">
O Lord my God
When I in awesome wonder
Consider all the worlds
Your hands have made
I see the stars
I hear the rolling thunder
Thy power throughout
The universe displayed
Then sings my soul
My Savior God to Thee
How great Thou art
Ooh, how great Thou art
Then sings my soul
My Savior God to Thee
How great Thou art
How great Thou art
When Christ shall come
With shouts of acclamation
And take me home
What joy will fill my heart
Then I will bow
In humble adoration
And there proclaim
My God, how great Thou art
Then sings my soul
My Savior God to Thee
How great Thou art
How great Thou art
Then sings my soul
My Savior God to Thee
How great Thou art
How great Thou art
