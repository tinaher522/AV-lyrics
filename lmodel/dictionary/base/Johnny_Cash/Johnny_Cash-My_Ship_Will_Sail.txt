<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="My_Ship_Will_Sail">
Life is just a passing moment
On an neverending trail
Though my pathway wanders for awhile
Someday my ship will sail
But I will walk this road awhile
I will walk it with a smile
And I will take it in my stride
Someday I'll be satisfied
I will walk this road awhile
I will walk it with a smile
I will take it in my stride
Someday I'll be satisfied
There's eternity before me
Just beyond the dark'ning veil
O my spirit hungers to go on
Someday my ship will sail
But I will walk this road awhile
I will walk it with a smile
And I will take it in my stride
Someday I'll be satisfied
I will walk this road awhile
I will walk it with a smile
I will take it in my stride
Someday I'll be satisfied
I will walk this road awhile
I will walk it with a smile
(fading out)I will take...
