<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="I've_Been_Everywhere">
I was totin' my pack along the dusty Winnemucca road
When along came a semi with a high canvas covered load
If you're goin' to Winnemucca, Mack, with me you can ride
And so I climbed into the cab and then I settled down inside
He asked me if I'd seen a road with so much dust and sand
And I said, "Listen! I've traveled every road in this here land"
I've been everywhere, man
I've been everywhere, man
Crossed the deserts bare, man
I've breathed the mountain air, man
Travel, I've had my share, man
I've been everywhere
I've been to:
Reno
Chicago

I've been everywhere, man
I've been everywhere, man

I've been everywhere, man
I've been everywhere, man
Crossed the deserts bare, man
