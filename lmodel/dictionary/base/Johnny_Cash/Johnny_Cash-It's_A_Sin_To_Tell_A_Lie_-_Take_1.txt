<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="It's_A_Sin_To_Tell_A_Lie_-_Take_1">
Be sure it's true when you say I love you
It's a sin to tell a lie
Millions of hearts have been broken
Just because these words were spoken
I love you, yes, I do, I love you
If you break my heart I'll die
So be sure that it's true
When you say I love you
It's a sin to tell a lie
Cross my heart and I hope to die
I'll never, never, never tell another white lie
Took my little girl out on a date last night
Next to her Greta Gerty would have looked alright
Now I'm between the devil and the deep blue sea
'Cause I said, "Baby, you look good to me"
I told her I loved her and oh, how I lied
Now she's getting set to be my blushing bride
If she leads me to the alter I'm sunk
'Cause I can not tell the preacher I was drunk
Lord have mercy on a no count sinner
Give me one more chance to let another guy win her
Cross my heart and hope to die
I'll never, never, never tell her one more time
I'll never tell another white lie
