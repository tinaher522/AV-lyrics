<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="Solitary_Man">
Melinda was mine
'Til the time
That I found her
Holding Jim
And lovin' Him
Then Sue came along
Loved me strong
That's what I thought
Me and Sue
But that died, too
Don't know that I will
But until I can find me
A girl who'll stay
And won't play games behind me
I'll be what I am
A solitary man
Solitary man
I've had it to here
Bein' where
Love's a small word
A part-time thing
A paper ring
I know it's been done
Havin' one
Girl who loves me
Right or wrong
Weak or strong
Don't know that I will
But until I can find me
The girl who'll stay
And won't play games behind me
I'll be what I am
A solitary man
Solitary man
Don't know that I will
But until love can find me
And a girl who'll stay
And won't play games behind me
I'll be what I am
A solitary man
A solitary man
Solitary man
