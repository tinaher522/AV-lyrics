<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="You're_My_Baby">
Hey you got hair, long an' black
Hangin' down in the middle of your back
Don't you cut it off whatever you do
I need it to run my fingers through
'Cause you're my baby,
Ah-ah, you're my sugar
Yeah drive me crazy,
Little wooly booger
Well I got a guitar, got six strings
And a guitarpick that a-make 'em ring
Every string got a note or two
That I'm gonna use to serenade you
'Cause you're my baby,
Ah-ah, you're my sugar
Don't mean maybe
Little wooly booger
Well I got a dollar that I saved
Saved it up for a rainy day
Everybody's callin' for bills that's due
And if they don't catch me, I'll spend it on you
'Cause you're my baby,
Ah-ah, you're my sugar
Drive me crazy,
Little wooly booger
Well I had me a gal, she said she's mine
But she run around on me all the time
Now she's gone I'm glad we're through
'Cause I-I'm plum-guggled-eyed over you
'Cause you're my baby,
Ah-ah, you're my sugar
Yeah don't mean maybe,
Drive me crazy
Don't mean maybe,
Little wooly booger
