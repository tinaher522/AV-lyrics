<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="Crystal_Chandeliers_And_Burgundy">
This boxcar's been my home since St Antone
'Cause this ankle of mine I turned while hoppin' on
Shoots pain that feeds my dreams with luxuries
I see crystal chandeliers and burgundy
I can feel my mother's heartbeat from the track
It's the rhythm of a son that won't be back
Lord knows where my mind is takin' me
I see crystal chandeliers and burgundy
If that conductor only knew all the trouble I've been through
Just to be here on this train once again
Freedom of a hobo ain't so bad you can dream of all the wealth you might've had
I guess livin' on this train is gettin' to me I see crystal chandeliers and burgundy
If that conductor only knew all the trouble I've been through
Just to be here on this train once again
If there's nothing in this world I've gotta do
But to ride these rails of steel my whole life through
Then take away these visions that I see of crystal chandeliers and burgundy
Of crystal chandeliers and burgundy
