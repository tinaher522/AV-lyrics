<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="The_Rebel_-_Johnny_Yuma">
(Away away way he rode the Rebel Johnny Yuma) 
Johnny Yuma was the rebel he roamed through the west 
Yeah Johnny Yuma the rebel he wandered alone 
He got fightin' mad this rebel lad he packed no star as he wandered far 
Where the only law was a hook and a draw the rebel Johnny Yuma 
Johnny Yuma was the rebel he roamed through the west 
Yeah Johnny Yuma the rebel he wandered alone 
He searched the land this restless lad he was panther quick and leather tough 
Witht the figure that he's been pushed enough the rebel Johnny Yuma (Johnny Yuma) 
Johnny Yuma was the rebel he roamed through the west 
Yeah Johnny Yuma the rebel he wandered alone 
Fightin' mad this rebel lad with the dreams he's hold till his dyin' breath 
He searched his soul and gambled with death the rebel Johnny Yuma 
(Away awayway he rode the Rebel Johnny Yuma Johnny Yuma)
