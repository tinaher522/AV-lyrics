<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="Like_A_Soldier">
With the twilight colors falling 
And the evening laying shadows 
Hidden memories come stealing from my mind 
As I feel my own heart beating out 
The simple joy of living 
I wonder how I ever was that kind
But the wild road I was rambling 
Was always out there calling 
You said a hundred times I should have died 
Then you came down and touched me
And lifted me up with you
So I believe that it was a road I was meant to ride
I'm like a soldier getting over the war 
Like a young man getting over his crazy days 
Like a bandit getting over his lawless ways 
I don't have to do that anymore
I'm like a soldier getting over the war
Nights and days that arn't remembered 
And there's pain that's been forgotten 
And other things I choose not to recall 
There are faces that come to me 
That I thought were long forgotten
Faces that I wish would not come back at all
But in my dreams parade of lovers 
From the other times and places 
There's not one that matters now, no matter who 
I'm just thankful for the journey 
And that I've survived the battles 
And that my reward for victory is you
I'm like a soldier getting over the war 
Like a young man getting over his crazy days 
Like a bandit getting over his lawless ways 
I don't have to do that anymore
I'm like a soldier getting over the war
