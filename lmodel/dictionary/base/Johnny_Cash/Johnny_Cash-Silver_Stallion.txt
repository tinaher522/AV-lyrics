Verse 1:(Kris Kristofferson) E A E A I'm gonna steal a silver stallion,with not a mark upon his silky hide E A E A Teach him he can trust me like a brother,one day we'll saddle up and rideChorus:(All together with the lead voice of Johnny Cash) G#m C#m And we're gonna ride,we're gonna ride A Ride like the one eyed jack of diamonds with the devil close behind G#m We're gonna rideVerse 2:(Waylon Jennings) E A E A I'm gonna find me a reckless woman,razor blades and dice in her eyes E A E A Just a touch of sadness in her fingers,thunder and lightening in her thighsChorus.Verse 3:(Willie Nelson) E A E A I'm gonna chase the sky forever,with the woman and the stallion and the wind E A E A The sun is gonna burn into a cinder,before we ever pass this way againChorus.Chords used: G#m C#m |||||| |||||| |||||| |||||| |||||| |||||| the others are classic... xxxxxx xxxxxx |||||| ||||x| |xx||| ||xx||Thanks to David M.
