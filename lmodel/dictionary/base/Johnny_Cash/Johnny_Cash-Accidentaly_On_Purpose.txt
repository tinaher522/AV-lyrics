<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="Accidentaly_On_Purpose">
Accidentaly I saw you this morning
You were lovely dressed in your wedding gown
And they say that you married a stranger
To me that had drifted to our old hometown
Accidentaly you've met him one evening
And you say it was love at first sight
Accidentaly on purpose you've married
Accidentaly on purpose for spite
Cause I saw out cheatin' and runnin' around
And I was just a fool with a heart of a clown
Accidentaly you were mistaken that night
Accidentaly on purpose for spite
Cause I saw out cheatin', and runnin' around
And I was just a fool with a heart of a clown
Accidentaly you were mistaken that night
Accidentaly on purpose for spite
