<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="Get_Rhythym">
Hey, get rhythm when you get the blues
C'mon, get rhythm when you get the blues
Get a rock and roll feelin' in your bones
Put taps on your toes and get gone
Get rhythm when you get the blues
A little shoeshine boy never gets low down
But he's got the dirtiest job in town
Bendin' low at the peoples' feet
On the windy corner of the dirty street
Well, I asked him while he shined my shoes
How'd he keep from gettin' the blues
He grinned as he raised his little head
He popped a shoeshine rag and then he said
Get rhythm when you get the blues
C'mon, get rhythm when you get the blues
A jumpy rhythm makes you feel so fine
It'll shake all the trouble from your worried mind
Get rhythm when you get the blues
Get rhythm when you get the blues
C'mon, get rhythm when you get the blues
Get a rock and roll feelin' in your bones
Put taps on your toes and get gone
Get rhythm when you get the blues
Well, I sat down to listen to the shoeshine boy
And I thought I was gonna jump with joy
Slapped on the shoe polish left and right
He took a shoeshine rag and he held it tight
He stopped once to wipe the sweat away
I said, "You're a mighty little boy to be-a workin' that way"
He said, "I like it", with a big wide grin
Kept on a poppin' and he said again
Get rhythm when you get the blues
C'mon, get rhythm when you get the blues
It only cost a dime just a nickel a shoe
It does a million dollars worth of good for you
Get rhythm when you get the blues
