<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="It's_All_Over">
I was on my way to you and I was worried
I was all torn up and nervous 'cause I knew that you'd be gone
I knocked and crossed my fingers while I waited
And I couldn't hide the teardrops when I walked away alone
It's all over, it's all over, my heart echoed it's all over
Every minute that you cry for her is wasted don't you know
It's all over, it's all over, my heart echoed it's all over
Stop your cryin' turn around and let her go
I'd been runnin' 'round in circles like a baby
I was in a daze because I loved you so, I couldn't see
I was broken in a million little pieces
When I saw enough to realize, you didn't care for me
It's all over, it's all over, my heart echoed
Every minute that you cry for her is wasted don't you know
It's all over, it's all over, so forget her
Stop your cryin' turn around and let her go, let her go, boy, let her go
