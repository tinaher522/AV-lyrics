<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="Supper-Time">
Many years ago in days of childhood I used to play 'til evening time would come
Still winding down that old familiar pathway I hear my mother call at setting sun
Come home come home it's suppertime the shadows lengthen fast
Come home come home it's suppertime we're going home at last
Some of the fondest mem'ries of my childhood are woven around suppertime
When mother used to call from the backsteps of the old homeplace
Come on home now son it's suppertime my how I'd love to hear that once again
But you know time has woven for me a realization of truth that's even more thrilling
That someday we'll be called up to gather around the suppertable up there
For the greatest suppertime of them all with our Lord
I can almost hear the call now comin' from the portals of heaven
Come home son it's suppertime come on home
Come home come home
