<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="Galway_Bay">
If you ever go across the sea to Ireland,
it maybe at the closing of your day,
You will sit and watch the moon rise over Claddagh,
And see the sun go down on Galway Bay. 
Just to hear again the ripple of the trout stream,
The women in the meadow making hay.
and to sit beside a turf fire in the cabin,
And watch the barefoot gosoons at their play. 
For the breezes blowin' o'er the sea from Ireland
Are perfumed by the heather as they blow
And the women in the uplands diggin' praties
Speak a language that the strangers do not know. 
Yet the stangers came and tried to teach us their way.
They scorned us just for bein' what we are.
But they might as well go chasing after moon beams,
Or light a penny candle from a star. 
And if there's is going to be a life hereafter,
And somehow I am sure there's going to be,
I will ask my God to let me make my heaven,
In that dear land across the Irish sea.
