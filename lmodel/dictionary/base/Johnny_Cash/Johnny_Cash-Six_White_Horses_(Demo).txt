<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="Six_White_Horses_(Demo)">
Mhm some folks drink and some folks smoke
Some folks love and some folks don't
Some folks laugh and some folks frown
Some folks heel other gun you down
Goodbye John six white horses come to take you home
Goodbye John took you away before you sang your song hmm
Some preach wrong and some preach right
Some preach love and some preach fight
Takes every kind to make the world go round
Takes only one to gun you down
Goodbye Martin six white horses come to take you home
Goodbye Reverend took you away before you sang your song hmm
Some people stick pretty close to home
Others are born with the urge to roam
Welcome welcome to our town
I hope nobody tries to gun you down
Goodbye Bobby six white horses come to take you home
Goodbye Robert took you away before you sang your song
Goodbye John goodbye Martin goodbye Bobby
They took you away before you sang your song hmm
