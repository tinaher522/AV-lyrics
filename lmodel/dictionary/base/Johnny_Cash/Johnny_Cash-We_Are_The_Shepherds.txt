<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="We_Are_The_Shepherds">
So here is the stable and there is the manger 
The new Saviour sleeps on his first earthly night 
The wise men brought riches but we brought a candle 
It's all that we have but it gives a good light 
We are the shepherds we walked cross the mountains 
We left our flocks when the new star appeard 
Oh the beautiful singin' of heavenly choir 
We had to come see him we had to come here 
We beg you forgive us for such a small offering 
But our sheep are out there with wolves in the night 
We bring you this candle it's all we have with us 
But with it the new Saviour has his first light 
We are the shepherds... 
We thank Thee kind Joseph for bidding us enter 
Please take our gift for the new babe to thine 
'Tis only one candle but it is our symbol 
Of how we believe that his great life will shine 
We are the shepherds...
