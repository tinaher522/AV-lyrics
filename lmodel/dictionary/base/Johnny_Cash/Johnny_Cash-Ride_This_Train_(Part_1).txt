Ride this train up and down and across a strange wonderful land 
It's almost like a fairyland when you to think about it 
You go through places with names like Tuscaloosa Kokomo Muskogee Oshkosh Saginaw 
Eureka Bandera Battle Creek Sioux City Chattanooga 
Hattiesburg Lynchburg and Baltinare Arkansas 
You see I'm a million different people from all over the world 
And I've been coming to this country for hundreds of years 
This was the Promised Land for me 
But let's not forget that when I came here 
There were already millions of people living in teepees along the rivers 
And hunting deer and buffalo for food and shelter 
And it's with a little regret that I think of how I pushed them back 
And crowded them out to claim this land for myself or for another country 
But the Indians' hearts must have been full of music 
For they left names with me that seem to sing 
Names like Mohawk Mandan Kickapoo Cree Yacoma Seminole Crow Shawnee 
Choctaw Delaware Fox Paiute Winnebago Cheyenne Blackfoot 
Navajo Ute Comanche Quapaw Creek Apache Sioux Chippewa 
Ardua Hupa Shoshone Mow Hicano Sage Menomini 
Shinouk Arapaho Nez Perce Iroquois Pony Cutenai 
Flathead Chickasaw Pueblo Yuma Pima Pomo Caddo 
Well a lot of them are still with me and I'm glad 
It's for sure their names will always be with me 
But let's look a little at the heart and muscle of this land 
Few things you don't read in books things that aren't taught in school 
Now you take this little town we're goin' through here this is Beach Creek Kentucky 
And right down there in the valley that's where our house used to be 
It was a little shotgun shack with a spring out back 
And a smokehouse and another little bitty house and that's about all 
My pa was a coalminer like most everybody in Mulengerg County 
Worked in the mines all his life 
I guess he didn't have much ambition to do anything else 
Cause they say coalmining kinda gets in your blood 
Matter of fact pa said if they ever drained the blood out of him 
It would be blacker than black strap moulesen 
When I was a kid I used to sit at the fireplace there with mom 
And wait on pa to get in from the mine 
And we'd sure get anxious if he was ever late 
Ma would rock back and forth and watch the clock listin' for pa to hit the front porch 
Then he'd come in nothin' clean but the whites of his eyes 
And he'd reach for that lie-soap and starts scrubbin' 
And I'd stand back and watch him and say to myself 
Boy I'll be glad when I get big enough to work in the mines
