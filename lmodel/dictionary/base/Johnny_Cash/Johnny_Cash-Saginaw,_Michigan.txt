<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="Saginaw,_Michigan">
I was born in Saginaw Michigan and I grew up in a house on Saginaw bay
My daddy was a poor hard working Saginaw fisherman
Too many times he came home with too little pay
I loved a girl in Saginaw Michigan she was the daughter of a very, very wealthy man
But he called me that son of a Saginaw fisherman
And not good enough to ever claim his daughter's hand
That's why I'm up here in Alaska lookin' around for gold
Like a crazy fool I'm diggin' in the frozen ground so cold
But with each day I pray I'll strike it rich and then
I'll go back home and claim my love in Saginaw Michigan
I wrote my love in Saginaw Michigan
I said honey I'm a coming home please wait for me
And you can tell your dad that I'm coming back a richer man
I hit the biggest strike in Klondyke history
Her daddy met the bus in Saginaw Michigan
And he gave me a great big party with champagne
Then he said son you're a wise young, ambitious man
Why don't you sell your father-in-law your Klondyke claim
Now he's up there in Alaska diggin' in the cold, cold ground
That greedy fool is a lookin' for the gold I never found
But it serves him right and nobody here is missing him
Least of all the newly weds of Saginaw Michigan
