<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="Christmas_Time's_A_Comin'">
Christmas time's a comin' Christmas time's a comin'
Christmas time's a comin' and I know I'm going home
Snowflakes are fallin' my old home's a callin'
Tall pines are humming Christmas time's a comin'
Can't you hear them bells ringing ringin' joy joy hear them singin'
When it's snowing I'll be going back to my country home
Christmas time's a comin'
White candles burnin' my old heart's a yearnin'
For the folks at home when Christmas time's a comin'
Can't you hear them bells
Hollies in the window home where the wind blows
I can't walk for runnin' Christmas time's a comin'
Can't you hear them bells
Christmas time's a comin'
Christmas time's a comin'
