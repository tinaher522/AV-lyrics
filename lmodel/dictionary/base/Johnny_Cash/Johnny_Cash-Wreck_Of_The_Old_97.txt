<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="Wreck_Of_The_Old_97">
Well they gave him his orders at Monroe Virginia
Said Steve you're way behind time
This is not 38 this is old 97
Put her into Spencer on time
Then he turned around and said to his black greasy fireman
Shovel on a little more coal
And when we cross that White Oak Mountain
Watch old 97 roll
And then the telegram come to Washington station
This is how it read
Oh that brave engineer that run old 97
He's a layin' in old Danville dead
'Cause he was goin' down the grade makin' 90 miles an hour
Whistle broke into a scream
He was found in the wreck with his hand on the throttle
A scalded to death by the steam
So now all you ladies you better take a warnin'
From this time on and learn
Never speak harsh words to your true lovin' husband
He may leave you and never return for more
