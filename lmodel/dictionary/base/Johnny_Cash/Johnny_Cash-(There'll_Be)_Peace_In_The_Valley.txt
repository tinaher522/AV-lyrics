<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="(There'll_Be)_Peace_In_The_Valley">
Well, I'm tired and so weary but I must go along
Till the Lord comes and calls, calls me away, oh yes
Well, the morning's so bright and the Lamb is the light
And the night, night is as black as the sea, oh yes
(There will be peace in the valley for me some day)
There will be peace in the valley for me dear Lord, I pray
(There'll be no sadness no sorrow no trouble I see)
There will be peace in the valley for me
(For me)
Well, the bear will be gentle and the wolf will be tame
And the lion shall lay down with the lamb, oh yes
And the beast from the wild will be lead by a child
And I'll be changed changed from this creature that I am, oh yes
(There will be peace in the valley for me some day)
There will be peace in the valley for me dear Lord, I pray
(There'll be no sadness no sorrow no trouble I see)
There will be peace in the valley for me
(For me)
