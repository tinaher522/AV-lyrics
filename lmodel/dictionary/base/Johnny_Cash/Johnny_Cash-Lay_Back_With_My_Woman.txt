<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="Lay_Back_With_My_Woman">
Well my saddle's on my horse but I ain't goin' nowhere
'Cause my ridin' days are over and there's vultures in the air
Well the trails have been a brother and a devil all in one
I'm gonna lay back with my woman throw away my fightin' guns
Well I spent many lonely evenings listenin' to the howl of the wolfe
Talk about her like a loved one did you ever kiss a horses' hoof
They keep puttin' up all them fences to section up the country mile
I'm gonna lay back with my woman and take it easy for a while
Yes there's danger on the prairie there's rattlesnakes that bite
In every little town you come to there's always a good old fight
Well there's nothin' like his and her place I wouldn't say it if I didn't know
I'm gonna lay back with my woman and love her sweet country soul
Well you see her arms are ready and the kitchen's full of food
She's got a smile that's pretty but then it all looks kinda good
Can you blame a guy for thinkin' he'd be crazy to hit the trail
I'm gonna lay back with my woman and put my horses up for sale
I'm gonna lay back with my woman put my horses up for sale
