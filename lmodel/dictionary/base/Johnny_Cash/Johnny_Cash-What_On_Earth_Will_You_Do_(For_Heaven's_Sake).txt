<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="What_On_Earth_Will_You_Do_(For_Heaven's_Sake)">
Will you walk another mile turn a frown with a smile
Will you live the lowly heart about to break
Would you also give your cloak to one who took away your coat
What on earth will you do for heaven's sake
Would you feed the poor in spirit and befriend the persecuted
Will you show the bounds how all the chains can break
Did you sow the cropper seed will you walk among the weak
What on earth will you do for heaven's sake
Did you turn the other cheek are you counted with the meek
Would you give a little more than you can take
Will you shine your little light on the children of the night
What on earth will you do for heaven's sake
Will you feed the poor
