In the long, hot, thirsty summer of about 32 A.D.
Along a dusty highway, there came a man of Galilee
And as he went through Samaria, he stopped at Jacob's well
And there he met a woman whose deep secrets he would tell
"Could I have a drink of water?", Soft and quietly asked he
And she said, "Sir, I'm Samaritan, how dare you speak to me?"
He said, "If you would ask of me than either son of man
Would give you living water and you'd never thirst again'
Have a drink of water, everlastin' livin' water
Have a drink of water, everlastin' livin' water
Dip in' to the endless well, pour it on the fires of hell
Have a drink and sing and shout as the flames of hell go out
Have a drink of water, everlastin', endless water
Then the woman said, "Sir, you have no way to draw out of this well
Our father Jacob dug it and the stories it could tell
From this well drank his children and his kettle by the score
Where is your well, Sir, tell me, that will flow forever more"
And he answered and said, "Unto her your water will go dry
And my well is everlastin', if you drink you'll never die
My father God's a spirit and he set me under men
To give you living water so you'll never thirst again
Have a drink of water, everlastin' livin' water
Have a drink of water, everlastin' livin' water
Dip in' to the endless well, pour it on the fires of hell
Have a drink and sing and shout as the flames of hell go out
Have a drink of water, everlastin' livin' water
Well, there now are many thirstin' in this modern century
Whose thirst could be quenched quickly by the man from Galilee
For the water flows eternal from the well that never dries
For it flows right out of Heaven where the soul never dies
So if you're hot and tired and thirstin'
And if you crave a cool, tall drink
He will pour it right out for you a lot quicker than you think
He already knows you're thirsty so just let him come on in
And he'll give you livin' water and you'll never thirst again
Have a drink of water, everlastin' livin' water
Have a drink of water, everlastin' livin' water
Dip in' to the endless well, pour it on the fires of hell
Have a drink and sing and shout as the flames of hell go out
Have a drink of water, everlastin' livin' water
Have a drink of water, everlastin' livin' water, bro
Have a drink of water, ever last
Clap your hands and sing and shout
