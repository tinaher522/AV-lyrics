Ride this train to Bogaloosa Louisiana see these swamps and forest 
Man's never set foot in a lot of it 
You'll find aligator mink coon possum squirrel otter and the lakes're full of fish 
You'll find places so virgin and fresh 
That you'd think the Lord just created it yesterday 
As a matter of fact some people say when this world was made 
A whole lot of it just must have looked like southern Louisiana does now 
In 1788 I left Halifax Nova Scotia with about two hundred other Acadians 
We made a long tiring journey south 
In our party of two hundred there was this beautiful girl 
That I just haven't quite been able to forget 
Dorraine was her name and Dorraine and I were 
Well we were kinda pledged to each other 
And then we said when we got to the promised land 
We'd build us a house and someday we'd have 
The biggest sugar-cane plantation in the country 
And I used to make Dorraine blush 
When I'd tell her we'd raise the biggest family in the country too
