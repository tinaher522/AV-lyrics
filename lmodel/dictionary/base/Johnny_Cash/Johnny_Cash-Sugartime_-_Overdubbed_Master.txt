<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="Sugartime_-_Overdubbed_Master">
Well now, sugar in the morning
Sugar in the evening, sugar at supper time
Be my little sugar and love me all the time
Honey in the morning
Honey in the evening, honey at supper time
Be my little honey and love me all the time
Put your arms around me, swear by stars above
You'll be mine forever in the heaven of love
Sugar in the morning
Sugar in the evening, sugar at supper time
Be my little sugar and love me all the time
Now, sugar time is anytime
That you're near, oh, you're so dear
Now don't you roam, just be my honeycomb
And live in a heaven of love
Well now, sugar in the morning
Sugar in the evening, sugar at supper time
Be my little sugar and love me all the time
