<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="Lumberjack">
I lived on a farm out in Iowa I pulled the corn and I worked in the hay 
Got trapped by a girl but I wiggled free heard the Oregon timber callin' me 
Will you tell me somethin' Mr Lumberjack is it one for forward and three for back 
Is it two for stop or four for go boy ask a whistle punk I don't know 
Well I learned this fact from a logger named Ray you don't cut timber on a windy day 
Stay out of the woods when the moisture's low 
Or you ain't gonna live to collect your doe 
Will you tell me somethin'... 
Well you work in the woods from morning till night 
You laugh and sing and you cuss and fight 
On Saturday night you go to Eugene, and on a Sunday morning your pockets are clean 
Will you tell me somethin'...
