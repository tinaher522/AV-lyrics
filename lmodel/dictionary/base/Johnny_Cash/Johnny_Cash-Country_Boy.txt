<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="Country_Boy">
Country boy, ain't got no shoes
Country boy, ain't got no blues
Well, you work all day while you want to play
In the sun and the sand, with a face that's tan
But at the end of the day, when your work is done
You ain't got nothin' but fun
Country boy, ain't got no ill
Country boy, ain't got no bill
You get a wiggly worm and then you watch him squirm
While you put him on a hook and you drop him in a brook
And if everything's gonna turn out right,
You're gonna fry fish tonight
Country boy, you're lucky free
Country boy, how I wish I was you and you was me
Country boy, you got work to do
Country boy, in the morning dew
You gotta plant all the seed, you gotta cut the weeds
There's many a row you know you gotta hoe
But when it's quittin' time, and your work is through
There's alot of life in you
Country boy, you got a shaggy dog
Country boy, up a hollow log
Well, he comes in a run, when you pick up your gun
And with a shell or two, and your dog and you
When you get your rabbit, you'll skin his hide
He's gonna be good fried
Country boy, you got a lot to lose
Country boy, how I wish I was in your shoes
