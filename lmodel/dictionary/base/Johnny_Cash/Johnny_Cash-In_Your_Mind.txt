In Your Mind  
In your mind
One foot on Jacob's ladder and one foot in the fire
And it all goes down in your mind
Livin' at the bottom of the stairs of life
Never a smile knockin' on your door
The air is blue and so are you
Prehistoric monsters on the floor
Last verse of your last song
And God don't hear dead men
The end of the line is in your mind
Then you'll be stayin' in
In your mind  
In your mind
Bone for bone and skin for skin
Eye for eye and tooth for tooth
Heart for heart and soul for soul
Somebody said "What is truth"?
Lock it up and close it down
The sound of mournin' like a dove
High beyond the rattlin' roar
Lookin' to the face of love
In your mind  
In your mind
It all goes down in your mind
One foot on Jacob's ladder and one foot in the fire
And it all goes down in your mind
In your mind  
In your mind
Sunday words are back again
And you eat your fundamentalist pie
But just a piece you understand
You get the rest up in the sky
Praise and glory, wounded angels
Shufflin' 'round the room
Eternity is down the hall
And you sit there bendin' spoons
In your mind  In your mind
Father, Son, and Holy Ghost
Sacrificial drops of pain
On a silver plated cross
Sanctification on a chain
Thay say redemption draweth nigh
The storms of silence from above
Stop your ears and close your eyes
And try to find the face of love
In your mind  
In your mind
It all goes down in your mind
One foot on Jacob's ladder and one foot in the fire
And it all goes down in your mind
In your mind  
In your mind
It all goes down in your mind
One foot on Jacob's ladder and one foot in the fire
And it all goes down in your mind
