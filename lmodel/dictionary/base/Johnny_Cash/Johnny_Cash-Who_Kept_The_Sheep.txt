<song artist="Johnny_Cash" title="Who_Kept_The_Sheep">
The shepherds afar left their flocks by night 
Followed the new star by its heavenly light 
Did the lambs fear the wolves did they lay down and sleep 
Who kept the sheep who kept the sheep 
Did robbers not steal or did they fear the light 
That the shepherds had followed night after night 
Did they not stray did little lambs weep who kept the sheep who kept the sheep 
Under the new star the new Saviour lay in his dim manger he lay on the hay 
The shepherds that came had a vigil to keep 
But who kept the sheep who kept the sheep who kept the sheep who kept the sheep
