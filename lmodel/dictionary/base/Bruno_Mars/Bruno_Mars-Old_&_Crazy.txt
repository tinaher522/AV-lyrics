Esperanza Spalding
Will you still call me baby when I'm old and crazy?
Bruno Mars
When I'm old and crazy, will you still call me baby?
Esperanza Spalding
Will you act the same? Will you laugh the same?
Will you think I'm pretty when my hair's grey?
Bruno Mars
Will you still call me baby when I'm old and crazy?
Will you still hold my hand when my clothes are out of style?
My teeth all ran away and I don't ever save smile
Esperanza Spalding
Will you still call me baby when I'm old and crazy?
Bruno Mars
When I'm old and crazy, will you still call me baby?
Esperanza Spalding
Will you act the same? Will you laugh the same?
Will you think I'm pretty when my hair's grey?
Bruno Mars
Will you still call me baby when I'm old and crazy?
Esperanza Spalding
Will you still wanna dance even if my hips are weak?
My ears don't hear so well and I can't find a beat
Will you still call me baby when I'm old and crazy?
Bruno Mars
When I'm old and crazy, will you still call me baby?

Will you act the same? Will you laugh the same?
Will you think I'm pretty when my hair's grey?
Bruno Mars
Will you still call me baby?

Will you still call me baby?
