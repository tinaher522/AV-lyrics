Verse:
There's only so many songs that I can sing to pass the time
And I'm running outta things to do to get you off my mind (oh)
All I have is this picture in a frame
That I hold close to see your face everyday
Chorus:
With you is where I'd rather be
But we're stuck  where we are and its so hard, so far
This long distance is killin' me
I wish that you were here with me
But we're stuck where we are and its so hard, so far
This long distance is killin' me
It's so hard (so hard)
When we are (when we are)
We're so far, this long distance is killin' me
It's so hard (so hard)
When we are (when we are)
So far, this long distance is killin' me
Verse:
Now the minutes feel like hours and the hours feel like days
While I'm away
You know right now I can't be home
But I'm comin home soon, coming home soon
All I have is this picture in a frame
That I hold close to see your face again
Chorus:
With you is where I'd rather be
But we're stuck where we are and it's so hard, so far
This long distance is killin' me
I wish that you were here with me
But we're stuck  where we are and its so hard, so far
Breakdown:
Can you hear me cryin'? (Oooooh)
Can you hear me cryin'? (Oooooh)
Can you hear me cryin'? (Oooooh)
Chorus:
With you is where I'd rather be
But we're stuck where we are and it's so hard, so far
This long distance is killin' me
I wish that you were here with me
But we're stuck where we are and its so hard, so far
It's so hard (so hard)
When we are (when we are)
We're so far, this long distance is killin' me
It's so hard (so hard)
When we are (when we are)
So far, this long distance is killin' me
There's only so many songs that I can sing to pass the time
