[Hook: Bruno Mars]
This ones for you and me living out our dreams
We're all right where we should be
With my arms out wide, I open my eyes and now all I wanna see
Is a sky full of lighters, a sky full of lighters
[Verse 1: Eminem]
By the time you hear this, I woulda already spiraled up
I would never do nothing to let you cowards fuck my world up
If I was you I would duck, or get struck like lightnin'
Fighters keep fightin', put you lighters up, point them skyward, uh
Had a dream I was king, I woke up still king
Rap game's nipple is mine for the milking
'til nobody else even fuckin' feels me, 'til it kills me
I swear to God I'll be the fuckin' illest in this music
There is, or there ever will be, disagree? Feel free
But from now on I'm refusing to ever give up
Only thing I ever gave up's using, no more excuses
Excuse me, if my head is too big for this building
And pardon me if I'm a cocky prick, but you cocks are slick
Poppin' shit on how you flipped your life around, crock of shit
Who you dicks tryna kid? Flip dick you did opposite
You stayed the same, cause cock backwards is still cock you pricks
I love it when I tell them shove it cause it wasn't that
Long ago when Marshall sat flustered, lacked luster
Cause he couldn't cut mustard, muster up nothing
Brain fuzzy cause he's buzzin', woke up from that buzzer
Now you wonder why he does it how he does it? Wasn't cause he had buzzards
Circling around his head waiting for him to drop dead, was it?
Or was it cause some bitches wrote him off? Little hussy ass scuzzes
Fuck it, guess it doesn't matter now, does it?
What difference it make? What's it take to get it through your thick skulls
That this ain't, some bullshit people don't usually come back this way
From a place that was dark as I was in just to get to this place
Now let these words be like a switchblade to a hater's ribcage
And let be known from this day forward, I wanna just say thanks
Cause your hate is what gave me the strength
So let them Bics raise cause I came with 5'9" but I feel like I'm 6'8"
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Royce]
By the time you hear this I probably already be outty
I advance like going from toting iron
To goin and buying 4 or 5 of the homies the Iron Man Audi
My daddy told me slow down boy, you're going to blow it
And I ain't gotta stop the beat a minute
To tell Shady I love the same way that he did Dr. Dre on the Chronic
Tell him how real he is or how high I am
Or how I would kill for him, for him to know it
I cried plenty tears, my daddy gotta bad back
So it's only right, that I write till he can march right
In to that post office and tell 'em to hang it up
Now his career's Lebron's Jersey in 20 years
I stop when I'm at the very top
You shitted on me on your way up, there's bout to be a scary drop
Cause what goes up, must come down
You goin down I'm something you don't wanna see, like a hairy box
Every hour, happy hour now, life is wacky now
Used to have to eat the cat to get the pussy
Now I'm just the cat's meow, oow, outclass the count
Always down for the catchweight, like Pacquiao
Y'all are doomed, I remember when T-Pain ain't wanna work with me
My car starts itself, parks itself and auto-tunes
Cause now I'm in the Aston, I went from having my city locked up
To getting treated like Kwame Kilpatrick
And now I'm fantastic, compared to a weed high
And y'all niggas just gossiping like bitches
On a radio and TV, see me, we fly
Y'all buggin out like Wendy Williams staring at a bee hive
And how real is that? I remember signing my first deal
Now I'm the second best, I can deal with that
Now Bruno can show his ass, without the MTV awards gag
[Bridge: Bruno Mars]
You and I know what it's like
To be kicked down, forced to fight
But tonight, we're all right
So hold up your lights, let it shine, because
[Hook]
