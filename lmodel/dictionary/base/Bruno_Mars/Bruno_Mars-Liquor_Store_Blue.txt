<song artist="Bruno_Mars" title="Liquor_Store_Blue">
Standing at this liquor store, whiskey coming through my pores
Feeling like I run this whole block
Lotto tickets, cheap beer, that's why you can catch me here
Tryin' to scratch my way to the top
'Cause my job's got me going nowhere
So I ain't got a thing to lose
Take me to a place where I don't care
This is me and my liquor store blues
I'll take one shot for my pain
One drag for my sorrow
Get messed up today
I'll be okay tomorrow
One shot for my pain
One drag for my sorrow
Get messed up today
I'll be okay tomorrow
Me and my guitar tonight singing to the city lights
Tryin' to leave with more than what I got
'Cause 68 cent just ain't gonna pay the rent
So I'll be out until they call the cops
'Cause my job's got me goin' nowhere
So I ain't got a thing to lose
Take me to a place where I don't care
This is me and my liquor store blues
I'll take one shot for my pain
One drag for my sorrow
Get messed up today
I'll be okay tomorrow
One shot for my pain
One drag for my sorrow
Get messed up today
I'll be okay tomorrow
Here comes Junior Gong, I'm flying high like superman
And thinking that I run the whole block
I don't if it's just because pineapple kush between my jaws
Has got me feeling like I'm on top
Feeling like I woulda stand up to the cops
And stand up to the big guys, because de whole lot a dem saps
All de talk dem a talk and dem fly make no drop
Nuff ghetto youth cannot escape the trap
Give me this one shot for my pain
One drag for my sorrow
Get messed up today
I'll be okay tomorrow
One shot for my pain
One drag for my sorrow
Get messed up today
I'll be okay tomorrow
