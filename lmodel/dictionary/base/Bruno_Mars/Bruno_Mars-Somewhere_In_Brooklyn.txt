<song artist="Bruno_Mars" title="Somewhere_In_Brooklyn">
She was covered in leather and gold
Twenty-one years old
I lost her in the cold,
It's unfair, she's out there...
Somewhere, somewhere, somewhere in Brooklyn
She's somewhere, somewhere, somewhere in Brooklyn
Little Miss Perfect sitting at the train stop, 
Red Nike high-tops, listening to hip-hop
While we were waiting, started conversating 
Before I got her name, along came a train (ohhhhh)
Ohhhhhhh!
Next stop Brooklyn,
Ohhhhhhh!
Ohhhhhhh!
Now I'm lookin'...
She was covered in leather and gold
Twenty one years old
I lost her in the cold,
It's unfair, she's out there...
Somewhere, somewhere, somewhere in Brooklyn
She's somewhere, somewhere, somewhere in Brooklyn
(ciki-ciki)
On the street, kickin' rocks,
circlin' the same block
Greenpoint to Flatbush,
checking every corner shop,
tappin' people's shoulders, askin' if they know her
Everyday's the same, it's back to the train
Ohhhhhhh!
Ohhhhhhh!
Next stop Brooklyn,
Ohhhhhhh!
Ohhhhhhh!
I'm still lookin'
She was covered in leather and gold,
Twenty-one years old
I lost her in the cold,
It's unfair, she's out there...
Somewhere, somewhere, somewhere in Brooklyn,
She's somewhere, somewhere, somewhere in Brooklyn
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, I wonder will we ever meet again,
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, I wonder will we ever meet again
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Yeah, I wonder, if we'll ever meet again
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I hope we do,
Somewhere in Brooklyn
