Bruno Mars
Truth of the matter is I'm complicated
You're as straight as they come
You go about your day, baby
While I hide from the sun
It's better if you don't understand
'Cause you won't know what it's like until you try
You know I 
I'll be waiting on the other side
And you 
All you got to do is cross the line
I could wait a whole lifetime
But you just got to decide
You know I will be waiting on the other, waiting on the other side
Cee-Lo
We would live forever, 
Who could ask for more?
You could die if you wanted 
But baby what for?
It's better if you don't understand
And you won't know what it's like until you try
You know I 
I'll be waiting on the other side
And you 
All you got to do is cross the line
I could wait a whole lifetime
But you just got to decide
You know I I'll be waiting on the other, waiting on the other side
B.o.B
If they say life's a dream, call this insomnia
'Cause this ain't Wonderland it damn sure ain't Narnia
And once you cross the line You can't change your mind
Yeah I'm a monster but I'm no Frankenstein
And quite frankly I've been feelin' insane In between my eyes 
I really can't explain what I feel inside
If you knew what I was you'd run and hide (huh)
Many have tried to go into the night
And cross over the line and come back alive
But that's the price we payin' when we livin' on the other side
Bruno Mars
You know I 
I'll be waiting on the other side
And you 
All you got to do is cross the line
I could wait a whole lifetime
But you just got to decide
You know I I'll be waiting on the other, waiting on the other side
Bruno Mars &amp; Cee-Lo Green
It's better if you don't understand
It's better if you don't understand
It's better if you don't understand
It's better if you don't understand
It's better if you don't understand
It's better if you don't understand
