<song artist="Bruno_Mars" title="Talking_To_The_Moon">
I know you're somewhere out there
Somewhere far away
I want you back, I want you back
My neighbors think I'm crazy
But they don't understand
You're all I had, you're all I had
At night when the stars light up my room
I sit by myself, talking to the moon
Try to get to you
In hopes your on the other side, talking to me too
Oh am I a fool who sits alone talking to the moon 
oh oh oh
I'm feeling like I'm famous
The talk of the town
They say I've gone mad, yeah I've gone mad
They don't know what I know
Cuz when the sun goes down, someone's talking back, yeah they're talking back 
At night when the stars light up my room
I sit by my self, talking to the moon
Trying to get to you
In hopes you're on the other side, talking to me too
Oh am I a fool who sits alone, talking to the moon
ah ah ah ah
Do you ever hear me calling
ah ah ah ah
Cuz every night I'm talking to the moon
Still trying to get to you
In hopes you're on the other side, talking to me too
Or am I a fool who sits alone, talking to the moon
I know you're somewhere out there, somewhere far away..
