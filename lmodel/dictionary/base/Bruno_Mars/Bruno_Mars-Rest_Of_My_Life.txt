<song artist="Bruno_Mars" title="Rest_Of_My_Life">
Everyday I Wake Up Next To A Angel
More Beautiful Than Words Could Say
They Said It wouldn't Work But What Did They Know
Cause Years Passed And We're Still Here Today
Never In My Dreams Did I Think That This Would Happen To Me
As I Stand Here Before My Woman
I can't Fight Back The Tears In My Eyes
Oh How Could I Be So Lucky
I Mustve Done Something Right
And I Promise To Love Her For The Rest Of My Life
Seems Like Yesterday When She First Said Hello
Funny How Time Flys By When You're In Love
It Took Us A Lifetime To Find Each Other
It Was Worth The Wait Cause I Finally Found The One
Never In My Dreams Did I Think That This Would Happen To Me
As I Stand Here Before My Woman
I can't Fight Back The Tears In My Eyes
Oh How Could I Be So Lucky
I Mustve Done Something Right
And I Promise To Love Her For The Rest Of My Life
