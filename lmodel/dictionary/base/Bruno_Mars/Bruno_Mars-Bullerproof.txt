<song artist="Bruno_Mars" title="Bullerproof">
oooh oooh oh oh oooh 2x
oh oh
you've been hurt before
girl i know you
your heart's been through the storm and more
i can tell you barely survived
but girl my love won't be the same 
i'm not trying to run no game
just want your tears to dry
girl why do i have to pay for your past
i don't 
do you want to come at last
