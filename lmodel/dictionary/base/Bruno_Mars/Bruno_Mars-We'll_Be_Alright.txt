<song artist="Bruno_Mars" title="We'll_Be_Alright">
We are young, we run free
Stay up late, we don't sleep
Got our friends, got the night
We'll be alright
Tonight you won't be by your self-self
Just leave your problems on the shelf-shelf
You won't wanna be nowhere else-else
So let's go, so let's go (we got the club like)
(hoo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo) and all the girls sayin'
(hoo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo) the whole world sayin'
(hoo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo) yeah, yeah, come on let's
Get drunk, toast it up, we don't give a fuck
We are young, we run free
Stay up late, we don't sleep
Got our friends, got the night
We'll be alright
Throw our hands in the air
Pretty girls everywhere
Got our friends, got the night
We'll be alright
(hoo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo) alright, alright, alright
(hoo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo) ah, ah, ah, ah
(hoo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo) alright, alright, alright
(hoo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo) ah, ah, ah, ah
We walk the streets like we don't care-care
Our middle fingers in the air-air
So come and join us if you dare-dare
Yeah let's go, yeah let's go (we got the club like)
(hoo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo) and all the girls sayin'
(hoo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo) the whole world sayin'
(hoo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo) yeah, yeah, come on let's
Get drunk, toast it up, we don't give a fuck
We are young, we run free
Stay up late, we don't sleep
Got our friends, got the night
We'll be alright
Throw our hands in the air
Pretty girls everywhere
Got our friends, got the night
We'll be alright
It feels like, ahh-ah-ah-ah-ah
(It feels good, don't it?) ahh-ah-ah-ah-ah
(yo, yo, yeah, d-don't it?) yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(yeah) We'll be alright (ahh!)
It feels like, ahh-ah-ah-ah-ah
(It feels good, don't it?) ahh-ah-ah-ah-ah
(yo, yo, yeah, d-don't it?) yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(yeah) We'll be alright (uh-huh, ha-ha)
We are young, we run free
Stay up late, we don't sleep
Got our friends, got the night
We'll be alright
Throw our hands in the air
(ahh-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Pretty girls everywhere
(ahh-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Got our friends, got the night
(yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
We'll be alright
