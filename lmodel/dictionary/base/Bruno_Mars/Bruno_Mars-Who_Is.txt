<song artist="Bruno_Mars" title="Who_Is">
Oh, i was perfect 
For the circus 
if she dared me, i do it 
Love makes you stupid 
i gave it up, But i guess it was not enough 
Cause she never seemed satisfied 
(Oohh) 
i Know i'm not perfect 
But at the end of the day 
Who is ? 
(Oohh) 
she wanted someone thats perfect 
Well Okay 
But can you tell me Who is ? 
(Oohh x2) 
she set the bar 
Just above the stars 
A rocket could'nt reach it 
But i still kept on reaching 
she watched me try 
At least a thousand times 
If she loved me, She'd stop me But noo 
(Oohh) 
i Know i'm not perfect 
But at the end of the day 
Who is ? 
(Oohh) 
she wanted someone thats perfect 
Well Okay 
But can you tell me Who is ? 
I saw something worth my future 
So wrong So wrong 
In my mind i was all it took 
But i guess i wasn't wrong 
(Oohh) 
i Know i'm not perfect 
But at the end of the day 
Who is ? 
(Oohh) 
she wanted someone thats perfect 
Well Okay 
But can you tell me Who is ? 
(Oohh x2)
