<song artist="Bruno_Mars" title="Never_Say_You_Can't">
Oh ohh oh ohh  oh
when I was just a little boy 
barely strong enough to stand
I can always count on him oh 
he taught me everything I know
and till this day it shows 
he was more than just a friend
there was so many times I would doubt myself
but his words were always there to help
i wouldn't be 
where i am 
if my father didn't tell me 
to never say i can't
he'd carry me 
and never let me fall 
oh and the only thing he asked
right before he passed 
was to never say you can't
oh never say you cant 
ohhh 
so when lifes rain begins to fall 
and youre out there on your own 
and you cant see a thing 
oh no no 
just find that voice that understands
for me it was my old man
taught me to say the words I can 
oh 
there was so many times I would doubt myself 
but his words were always there to help 
I wouldn't be where I am 
if my father didn't tell me to never say I can't 
he'd carry me 
and never let me fall 
oh and they only thing he asked 
right before he passed 
was to never say you can't 
everything you taught me will stay with me forever 
no I wont forget a thing
oh because of my dad I now know myself better 
oh I hope i can do for him what he did for me 
I wouldnt be where I am 
if my father didnt tell me 
to never say I cant
oh he'd carry 
and never let me fall 
oh and they only thing he asked 
right before he passed
was to never say you cant
oh never say you can't (x2)
