<song artist="Bruno_Mars" title="Before_It_Explodes">
It's not a question of love,
Cause our love has never changed.
But all the little things keep piling up,
And life keeps getting in the way.
Don't make it harder than it is,
We both knew it'd come to this.
Better now than in a year,
We're not so cheesy,
And we both hate each other.
The fuse is already left,
So how about a final kiss?
Just let it go
And stop the madness,
Before it explodes!
Before it's out of our control.
Let's stop the madness,
Before it explodes!
We gotta let it go,
Before it all explodes.
Some things we won't understand,
And we're both so tired of being misunderstood.
So let's just turn around and walk away,
And hold on to what was got.
Don't make it harder than it is,
We both knew it'd come to this.
Better now than in a year,
We're not so cheesy,
And we both hate each other.
The fuse is already left,
So how about a final kiss?
Just let it go
And stop the madness,
Before it explodes!
Before it's out of our control.
Let's stop the madness,
Before it explodes!
We gotta let it go,
Before it all explodes.
There ain't nothing that can save us
But you're close to the edge
And what's the use of going on
If we're lying to each other every word that is said
It's too late for us now
Cause we can never count down
It's getting close!
It's gonna blow!
Stop the madness
Before it explodes!
Before it's out of our control.
Let's stop the madness,
Before it explodes!
We gotta let it go,
Before it all explodes!
We gotta stop the madness
Ooh...
