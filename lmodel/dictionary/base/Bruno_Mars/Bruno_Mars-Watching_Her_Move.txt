<song artist="Bruno_Mars" title="Watching_Her_Move">
She got it, she looking good
I'm just watching her move
She walks on in with her red dress on
Her lips as bright as the sun
Her curves goes every which way
Got skin like porcelain
The way her hair falls down her back
Billy accents her tattoo?
(Are you talking to me?)
The way her hair falls down her back
Billy accents her tattoo?
Her legs like a supermodel
She worn for them high heel shoes
She got every single guy in the club
Just watching her move
And she don't wanna dance with anyone
Let her do what she do
She got every single guy in the club
Just watching her move
And she don't wanna dance with anyone
Let her do what she do
Just watch her get it
(Get it)
Just watch her move
She pulls me to the side
Tells me she wants to go
I say, girl, I'm yours tonight
After this I'm taking you home
First and for most I dance with you
Get you in the mood
Maybe later, baby
Girl, I'll show you exactly how I do
She got every single guy in the club
Just watching her move
And she don't wanna dance with anyone
Let her do what she do
She got every single guy in the club
Just watching her move
And she don't wanna dance with anyone
Let her do what she do
Just watch her get it
(Get it)
Just watch her get it
(Get it)
God, baby, you look good
You sexy, watch her move
Watch her move
She got every single guy in the club
Just watching her move
And she don't wanna dance with anyone
Let her do what she do
She got every single guy in the club
Just watching her move
And she don't wanna dance with anyone
Let her do what she do
Just watch her get it
(Get it)
Just watch her get it
(Get it)
Look at her get it
Just watch her
Watch her move, ooh
