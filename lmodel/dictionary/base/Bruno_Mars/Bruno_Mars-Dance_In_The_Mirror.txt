<song artist="Bruno_Mars" title="Dance_In_The_Mirror">
She wakes up in the morning.. morning
Jumps in the shower.. shower
Ooooh ooooh
Then rubs on her lotion.. lotion
While she's wrapped in her towel.. towel
Ooooh ooooh
And no music on
Watch her dance to perfection.. perfection
Ooooh ooooh
I swear the bathrooms a club
The way she's showing love to her reflection.. reflection
Ooooh ooooh
Every morning I watch her from behind
But she don't know
I pretend that I'm asleep
But I don't miss a show
My favourite part of the day
Is when she dance in the mirror
Dance in the mirror
There's nothing more I can say
Just watch her dance in the mirror.. dance
Ooooh she's so cute.. cute.. cute
Dancing in the nude.. nude.. nude ohhh
My favourite part of the day
Is when she dance in the mirror
Dance in the mirror
It's late in the evening.. evening
We got dinner reservations.. reservations
Ooooh ooooh
She's taking her time
But I don't mind waiting
Nooo Noooo
I don't get impatient
Cause when she gets naked
Oh the temptation.. Oh the temptation
You make me wanna cancel all of our plans
Keep you right where you stand
Just wanna see you dance oh
Every morning I watch her from behind
But she don't know
I pretend that I'm asleep
But I don't miss a show
My favourite part of the day
Is when she dance in the mirror
Dance in the mirror
There's nothing more I can say
Just watch her dance in the mirror.. dance
Ooooh she's so cute.. cute.. cute
Dancing in the nude.. nude.. nude ohhh
My favourite part of the day
Is when she dance in the mirror
Dance in the mirror
Ohhhhh
She's singing to herself like Da-da-da-da-da-da
Ohhhh
She's singing to herself like Da-da-da-da-da-da
My favourite part of the day
Is when she dance in the mirror
Dance in the mirror
There's nothing more I can say
Just watch her dance in the mirror.. dance
Ooooh she's so cute.. cute.. cute
Dancing in the nude.. nude.. nude ohhh
My favourite part of the day
Is when she dance in the mirror
Dance in the mirror
