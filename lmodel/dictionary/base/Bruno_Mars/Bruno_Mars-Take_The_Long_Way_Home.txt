<song artist="Bruno_Mars" title="Take_The_Long_Way_Home">
We've been hanging out all night 
Everything's been so nice 
Wish I didn't have to go 
Feeling sexy in your bedly
Touching me so gently
But I gotta get home
So many things to tell ya
So long since I held ya
Ooh boy you just don't know
Just don't know
So here's my proposition 
Don't speak boy just listen 
Before we go down this road
Take me the long way home
I'm not trying to leave you know
Aint no rush so can you slow down
Take me the long way home
I know that we're pulling up
And circle around the block 
So we can touch some more
Kiss me while we're there
Touch me while we're there 
Just take me the long way home
Kiss me while we're there
Touch me while we're there
Just take me the long way home
Wish I could stay all night
But I just can't tonight 
Cause I gotta be up at 6
Boy you made my heart melt
When you undid my seatbelt 
And told me to come give you a kiss
So many things to tell ya
So long since I held ya
Ooh boy you just don't know
Just don't know 
So here's my proposition 
Don't speak boy just listen 
Before we go down this road
[ Lyrics from: 
Take me the long way home
I'm not trying to leave you know
Aint no rush so can you slow down
Take me the long way home
I know that we're pulling up
And circle around the block 
So we can touch some more
Kiss me while we're there
Touch me while we're there 
Just take me the long way home
Kiss me while we're there
Touch me while we're there
Just take me the long way home
Something about you makes me wanna drive all night all night all night long
I can't wait when till the next time I see you (uh) home home
Take me the long way home
I'm not trying to leave you know
Aint no rush so can you slow down
Take me the long way home
I know that we're pulling up
And circle around the block 
So we can touch some more
Kiss me while we're there
Touch me while we're there 
Just take me the long way home
Kiss me while we're there
Touch me while we're there
Just take me the long way home
Your telling me aint no rush to stay there's no delay oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh... 
Kiss me while we're there
Touch me while we're there 
Just take me the long way home
Kiss me while we're there
Touch me while we're there
Just take me the long way home
Ah babe ah baby just take me the long way home
