<song artist="Bruno_Mars" title="Rest">
Everyday i wake up next to an angel
more beautiful than words can say 
they said it wouldnt work but what did they knowÂ ?
cause years have passed and were stil here today
never ...in my dreams did i think
that is woluld happen to me
as i stand here before my woman ..
i cant fight back the tears in my eyes
oh how could i be so lucky 
im must have done something right
and i promise to love her for the rest of my life.
seems like yesterday when she first said hello
funny how time flys when your in love
it took us a life time to find eachother
it was worth the wait caus i fuinally foudn the one 
never in my dreams did i think that this would happen 
to me 
as i stand here before my woman 
i cant fight back the tears in my eyes. 
oh how could i be so lucky 
i must have done something right.
and i promise to love her for the rest of my life.
