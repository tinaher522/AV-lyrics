<song artist="Bruno_Mars" title="Turn_Around">
Ah Ah I Dont Know Why Why
It Seems Like Every Other Night You Pick A Fight Fight
And I Know I Do The Same
Be Calling You Out Your Name
This Is Not What Lovers Are Supposed To Do Do
You Tell Me To Go I Start Walking Out
We Both Know What We're All about
We First Fight and Scream But Its All Because Of Love
But We Aint Never Giving up
Everytime I Try To Leave Something Tells Me Turn Around
Cause How Could I Ever Leave The Only One That Holds Me Down
Cause I Know We Can Work It Out Work It Out
Talk It Out Talk It Out
Stick It Out Stick It Out Oooh
Everytime I Try To Leave I Know We Can Figure It Out
Thats Why I Always Turn Around
Before You Say Say
Something You Know Youll Take Back Later on Today
Sometimes You Drive Me Crazy But I Love You Babe
All I Ask Is That You'll Always Appreciate Me
You Tell Me To Go I Start Walking Out
We Both Know What We're All about
We First Fight and Scream But Its All Because Of Love
But We Aint Never Giving up
Everytime I Try To Leave Something Tells Me Turn Around
Cause How Could I Ever Leave The Only One That Holds Me Down
Cause I Know We Can Work It Out Work It Out
Talk It Out Talk It Out
Stick It Out Stick It Out Oooh
Everytime I Try To Leave I Know We Can Figure It Out
Thats Why I Always Turn Around
Aint Nobody That Could Love Me
Like You Love Me
Thats Why I Always Turn Around
For you You Y-You You You....
Aint Nobody That Could Love Me
Like You Love Me
Thats Why I Always Turn Around
For you You Y-You You You....
Everytime I Try To Leave Something Tells Me Turn Around
Cause How Could I Ever Leave The Only One That Holds Me Down
Cause I Know We Can Work It Out Work It Out
Talk It Out Talk It Out
Stick It Out Stick It Out Oooh
Everytime I Try To Leave I Know We Can Figure It Out
Thats Why I Always Turn Around
