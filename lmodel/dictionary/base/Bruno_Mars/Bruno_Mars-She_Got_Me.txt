<song artist="Bruno_Mars" title="She_Got_Me">
I gotta find my way out of this hell, you got me into,
My baby's sleepin in anothers bed,
It's like i'm dreamin that walls are closing in on me,
I just wanna know you care.
I wanna find out why, you didnt choose to stay,baby,
You got me going crazy
Ooo... my baby she got me oh no...  she left me a prisoner inside my words, ooo...... my baby she got me oh no.. she locked me in prison like a criminal
Everyday's the same, your word, lied away, when all you go and done isnt me, i can see you now, your long brown hair and your white wedding gown, baby im missing you...
I wanna find out why, you didnt choose to stay oh..., oh ya...,
Ooo... my baby she got me oh  no... she left me a prisoner inside my words, ooo... my baby she got me oh no.. she locked me in prison like a criminal
I can't stop this, all this daydreaming , i gotta do my time... i ooo... i can't get out, i don't wanna feel this way, save me from this misery...
I wanna find out why, you didnt choose to stay, baby..., you got me going crazy...
Ooo... my baby she got me oh no...  she left me a prisoner inside my words, ooo...... my baby she got me oh no.. she locked me in prison like a criminal
I promise to love ya, hold ya, even when time got hard and i can still see us being forever, but now we're falling apart...
I wanna find out why, you didnt choose to stay, baby... you got me, ooo... my baby she got me oh no...  she left me a prisoner inside my words, ooo...... my baby she got me oh no.. she locked me in prison like a criminal
