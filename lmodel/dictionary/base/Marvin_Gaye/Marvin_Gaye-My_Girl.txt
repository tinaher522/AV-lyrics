<song artist="Marvin_Gaye" title="My_Girl">
I've got sunshine
On a cloudy day
When it's cold outside
I've got the month of May
I guess you'd say
What can make me feel this way?
My girl, my girl, my girl
Talkin' 'bout my girl
My girl
I've got so much honey
The bees envy me
I've got a sweeter song
Than the birds in the trees
Well, I guess you'd say
What can make me feel this way?
My girl, my girl, my girl
Talkin' 'bout my girl
My girl
Ooo-ooo, hoo-ooo
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Ooh yeah
I don't need no money
Fortune or fame
I got all the riches, baby
One man can claim
Well, I guess you'd say
What can make me feel this way?
My girl, my girl, my girl
Talkin' 'bout my girl
My girl
(Talkin' 'bout my girl)
I got sunshine on a cloudy day with my girl
I've even got the month of May with my girl
(Talkin' 'bout my girl)
Talkin' bout, talkin' 'bout, talkin' 'bout my girl
