<song artist="Marvin_Gaye" title="Soldier's_Plea">
While I'm away, darlin', how often do you think of me?
Remember, I'm over here, fighting to keep us free
Just be my little girl and always be true
And I'll be a faithful soldier boy to you
They say I'm now a man and should be spotted hard
But I don't think I'll make it, dear, if you don't play your part
Just say you'll be my girl and always be true
And I'll be a faithful soldier boy to you
Soldier boy to you
We all must do our share and darlin' I don't mind
The only thing that's greed in me is leaving you behind
Just say you'll be my girl and always be true
And I'll be a loving soldier boy, I'll be a faithful soldier boy,
I'll be a loving soldier boy to you
