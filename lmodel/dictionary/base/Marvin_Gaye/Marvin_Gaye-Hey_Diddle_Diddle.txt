Hey Diddle Diddle
love me just a little
please baby say you will
little boy blue
that's me without you
'cause you know how you make me feel
c'mon and love me
c'mon and love me baby
c'mon and love me
c'mon and love me baby
just like an apple
hanging from the tree
won't you come by and pick me off
please don't wait too long
pretty soon I might be gone
I must fall and I'll be lost
c'mon and love me
c'mon and love me baby
c'mon and love me
c'mon and love me baby
Hey Diddle Diddle
love me just a little
please baby say you will
little boy blue
that's me without you
'cause you know how you make me feel
I'm in misery
from this tortury
won't you look in my eyes and see
that I'm in distress
from this loneliness
trully your love is what I need
Oh
Ohh baby
just like Jack Cola
over on the corner
about to get down on my knees
baby marry
don't be contrary
give my heart all the love it need
c'mon and love me
c'mon and love me baby
c'mon and love me
c'mon and love me baby
Hey Diddle Diddle
love me just a little
please baby say you will
little boy blue
that's me without you
'cause you know how you make me feel
like jello on plate
I shiver and I shake
every time that you come near
