<song artist="Marvin_Gaye" title="Got_To_Give_It_Up">
I used to go out to parties and stand around
'Cause I was too nervous to really get down
But my body yearned to be free
I got up on the floor and thought somebody could choose me
No more standing there beside the walls
Finally got myself together, baby, and I'm havin' a ball
As long as you're groovin', there's always a chance
Somebody watchin' might wanna make romance
Move your body, ooh baby, you dance all night
To the groove and feel alright
Everybody's groovin' on like a fool
But if you see me, spread out and let me in
Baby, just party high and low
Let me step into your erotic zone
Move it up, turn it 'round
Ooh, shake it down, ow
You can love me when you want to, babe
This is such a groovy party, baby
We're here face to face
Everybody's swingin'
This is such a groovy place
All the young ladies are so fine
You're movin' your body
Easy with no doubts
I know what you thinkin', baby
You wanna turn me out
I think I'm gonna let you do it, babe
Keep on dancin'
You got to get it
Got to give it up
If you want it, you've got to give it up
If you want it, you've got to give it up
If you want it, you've got to give it up
If you want it, you've got to give it up
