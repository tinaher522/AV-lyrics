<song artist="Marvin_Gaye" title="Every_Now_And_Then">
darling why did I agree to ever let you go
why did I promise I'd ever try to see you no more
I thought I could find someone to take your place
instead I find memories of you so hard to erase
'cause every now and then
someone speaks your name
every now and then
I feel the flame
same old burning
burning deep within
to a dream I'm holding on
and all the time I know you're gone
some times I sit alone and stare into the night
and in my mind I see myself holding you tight
seems the love I feel is stronger than my will
cought in a world of disppair, 
close my eyes and pretend you are there
'cause every now and then
I hear your voice calling
every now and then
girl my tears start falling
darling, beyond my control
I miss the mess of your touch
I miss the love I need so much
every now and then
every now and then
I keep remembering
won't you come back baby
it's so hard living without you
I miss everything about you
why don't you come back
my whole world is crumbling
why don't you come back
the step I take without you, I'm stumbling
'cause every now and then
I feel the hurt inside
every now and then
I get you on my mind
of fools of thinking I get over you
and every street I'm coming down
I see you all around
'cause every now and then
every now and then
I feel the flame burning
I feel my heart yarning
every now and then
oh I miss your touch
every now and then
