<song artist="Marvin_Gaye" title="More_Than_A_Heart_Can_Stand">
Ooh it's more than a heart can stand
It's more than a heart can stand, yes it is
Oh my days were dark as night but the sunshine of your love
Baby, baby, brought light to me
I was lost, oh hopeless though
But like a blessing from above, you gave new life to me
Ooh now you say you're leaving
You say you're taking my sunshine away
Oh I can see the loneliness closing in on me
Ooh and it's more than a heart can stand
It's more than a heart can stand, yes it is
Losing you is more than a heart can stand, yes it is, yes it is
More than a heart can stand, yes it is
If I thought that crying would change your mind
Ooh baby, don't you know I'd cry a million tears
If I thought that lying would persuade you not to leave me
Ooh baby, oh I'd lie for a million years
Can't we talk it over, can't we make amends
Please don't lock me up in loneliness again
Ooh it's more than a heart can stand
Oh it's more than a heart can stand, yes it is
Losing you is more than a heart can stand, yes it is, yes it is
More than a heart can stand, yes it is
Oh now that you've brought me out of loneliness
Oh please, baby please, don't take my happiness
You know that I love you, no matter what you do
But what would I do without you?
It's more than a heart can stand
Oh it's more than a heart can stand, yes it is
Losing you is more than a heart can stand, yes it is, yes it is
It's more than a heart can stand, yes it is
