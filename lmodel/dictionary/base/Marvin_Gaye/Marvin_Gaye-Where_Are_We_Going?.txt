<song artist="Marvin_Gaye" title="Where_Are_We_Going?">
Oh oh, day in, day out
Sidewalk sleepers turn about
Day by day the work gets done
Day by day another war goes on
Tell me, where are we going?
Oh, what's the future showin'?
Oh, where are we headed?
With all that's goin' on where are we gettin'?
Day in, day out
A little boy and girl are goin' out
Day by day baby's babies are born
Day by day people say, "Right on"
Tell me, where are we going'?
Oh oh, what's the future showin'?
Oh, where are we headed?
With all that's goin' on where are we gettin'?
All we need
All we need
All we need
All we need
All we need, oh
Day in, day out
It gets better, the people shout
Day by day flames get higher
Lives and pains, yeah they fuel the fire
Oh where are we going?
Oh oh, what's the future showin'?
Where are we headed?
With all that's goin' on where are we gettin'?
Where are we going?
Where are we going?
Where are we going?
With all that's goin' on where are we headin'?
Day by day, baby
(Where are we going?)
Day by day
(Where are we going?)
(Where are we going?)
Day in, day out
(Where are we going?)
Day in, day out
Tell me, where are we going?
(Where are we going?)
Where are we going?
Where are we going?
Where are we going?
