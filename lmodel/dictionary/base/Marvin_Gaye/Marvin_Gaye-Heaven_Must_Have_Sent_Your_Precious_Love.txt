<song artist="Marvin_Gaye" title="Heaven_Must_Have_Sent_Your_Precious_Love">
Every day there's something new
Honey, to keep me lovin' you
And with every passin' minute
Ah baby, so much joy wrapped up in it
Heaven must have sent you from above
Wo, heaven must have sent your precious love
And I, I've got a song to sing
Tellin' the world about the joy you bring
And you gave me a reason for livin'
And, ooh, you taught me, you taught me the meaning of givin'
Heaven must have sent you from above
Wo, heaven must have sent your precious love
To find a love like ours is rare these days
'Cause you've shown me happiness, yes, in so many ways
I look in the mirror, and I'm glad to see
Laughter in the eyes where tears used to be
What you've given me I could never return
'Cause there's so much, girl, I have yet to learn
And I wanna show, I wanna show my appreciation
'Cause when I found you, I found a new inspiration
Heaven must have sent you from above
Wo, heaven must have sent your precious love
