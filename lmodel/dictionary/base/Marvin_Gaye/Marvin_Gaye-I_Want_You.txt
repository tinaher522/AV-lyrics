<song artist="Marvin_Gaye" title="I_Want_You">
I want you, the right way
I want you
But I want you to want me, too
Want you to want me baby
Just like I want you
Oh, I'll give you all the love
I want in return, sweet darling
But half the love is all I feel
Ooh, it's too bad it's just too sad
You don't want me now
But I'm gonna change your mind
Someway, somehow, aw baby
I want you, the right way
I want you
But I want you to want me, too
Want you to want me baby
Just like I want you
One way love is just a fantasy
To share is precious, pure and fair
Don't play with somethin'
You should cherish for life, oh baby
Don't you want to care
Ain't it lonely out there
I want you, the right way
I want you
But I want you to want me too
Want you to want me baby
When I get down with you, get down baby
Listen precious, I want you
I want you, the right way, baby
I want you, baby
But I want you to want me too
Want you to want me baby
The way I love you
