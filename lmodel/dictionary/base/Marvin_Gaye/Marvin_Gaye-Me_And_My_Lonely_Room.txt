<song artist="Marvin_Gaye" title="Me_And_My_Lonely_Room">
me and my lonely room
snapping my fingers, pacing the floor
i sulk in my lonely room as i lay my weary head down
then in comes your vision, your vision once again
i cry in my pillow baby
pacing the floor nowhere to go
as i stroll through the streets dragging my weary head down
then in comes your vision, your vision once again
