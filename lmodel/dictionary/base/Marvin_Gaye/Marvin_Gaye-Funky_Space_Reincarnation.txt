<song artist="Marvin_Gaye" title="Funky_Space_Reincarnation">
Two thousand and seventy three,
Two thousand and eighty four,
Two thousand and ninety three,
Light years ahead you and me gone be getting down on a space bed
We gone get married in June
We gonna be getting down on the moon,
Light years interplanetary forms on the get down star wars interplanetary funk
Still getting down
Music won't have no race only face
Peaceful face
All the time on this trip stuck inside my mothership
I can tell on your face that you really wanna stay space funky space
Peaceful space
Certain place wait till I feel cool
Hey baby lets get in the groove
Don't you look like somebody I met a long time ago
I know I ain't ever met you though
Oooh you look like I've been knowing you for a thousand years
Gosh ooh I don't know what's happening
You know I'm really involved but I been checking you out
You know uh getting some other reaction seems to me though
That we been together here we supposed to be together
Come on baby let's go peace loving and check out
This new smoke naw this thing I got
It ain't classified as dope smoke I got from venus
Have had it all week its getting old come on
And try this new thing with me baby
Too cold

Get in this sin machine and
Rock it rock it rock it rock it
Hey little baby let's magnetize magnets
Makes the love rise baby oooh sugar
Lets get some more why do I feel like I've been
