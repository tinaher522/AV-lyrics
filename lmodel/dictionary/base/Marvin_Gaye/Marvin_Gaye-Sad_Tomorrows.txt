<song artist="Marvin_Gaye" title="Sad_Tomorrows">
Flying High in the friendly sky, 
Without leaving the ground, 
Rest of the folks are tired and weary 
And have laid their bodies down I go to the place where danger waits - 
And its bound to forsake me.
So stupid minded,
 But I go crazy, when I cant find it,
In the morning I'll be alright my friends -
 Soon the night - will bring the pains again
Flying hight in the friendly sky, 
Without ever leaving the ground,
 Aint seen nothing but trouble baby - paraphernalia is my name 
Theres a place where the feeling awaits me,
Self destructions in my hands
So stupid minded, 
But I go crazy, when I can find it
I know I’m hooked my friends,  
To the boy 
Who makes slaves out of men...
Ahhh yeah
 (I did the best I could)
Ahhh yeah
 (Nobody understood)
Nobody, nobody
(I did the best I could )
Yeah, no, no
(Nobody understood)
Take me away, take me away...
