<song artist="Marvin_Gaye" title="Lonely_Lover">
Lonely lover cryin' through the night
'Cause the one you love has left you
Lonely lover cryin' alone in the dark
Your sighing just breaks my heart
I hear you cryin' from across the street
It keeps me awake, unable to sleep
I close my window, not wanting to hear
Still your cries echoes in my ears, hey, hey
Lonely lover cry your little heart out
Tryin' to wash away your hurt, yeah
Lonely lover, how I long to comfort you
'Cause when you're hurting, I'm hurt too
From my window across the street
I watched you kiss him tenderly
Kissing you like I never could
To you I'm just another guy in the neighborhood, hey, hey
I've heard neighbors sayin' that he's gonna put you down
For another girl, across town
Lonely lover sobbing through the night
How I long to hold you tight
Many nights I've wakened from my sleep
Hearin' you cryin' from across the street
Your neighborhood friend is all I'll be
But I still love you so tenderly, hey, hey
Lonely lover cryin' through the night
Lonely lover cryin' through the night
Ooh, lonely lover cryin' through the night
Ohh, lonely lover sobbin' and weepin', baby
