<song artist="Marvin_Gaye" title="Love's_More_Precious_Than_Gold_-_Previously_Unreleased">
The things I once thought exciting
They've all grown tiresome and old
Here's a fool learned a lesson
Love is more precious than gold
You may give her furs and jewel
But they, they will only grow old
Here's a fool learned a lesson
Love is more precious than gold
I once made a decision in my life
A long, long, long time ago
I went for money instead of love
Now I'm so blue and it only goes to show
The things I once thought exciting
They've all grown tiresome and old
Here's a fool learned a lesson
Love, love, it's more precious than gold
You won't need no money
It's more precious than jewel
Get your hand on some loving
You won't need no money
It's more precious than gold
More precious, it's more precious than gold
