<song artist="Marvin_Gaye" title="I_Heard_It_Through_The_Grapevine">
Ooh, I bet you're wond'rin' how I knew
'Bout your plans to make me blue
With some other guy you knew before
Between the two of us guys, you know I love you more
It took me by surprise I must say
When I found out yesterday
Don'tcha know that I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Oh, I heard it through the grapevine
Oh, I'm just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey, yeah
(Heard it through the grapevine)
(Not much longer would you be my baby)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
I know a man ain't supposed to cry
But these tears, I can't hold inside
Losin' you would end my life you see
'Cause you mean that much to me
You could have told me yourself
That you loved someone else
Instead I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Oh, I heard it through the grapevine
And I'm just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey, yeah
(Heard it through the grapevine)
(Not much longer would you be my baby)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
People say believe half of what you see
Son, and none of what you hear
But I can't help bein' confused
If it's true, please, tell me, dear
Do you plan to let me go
For the other guy you loved before?
Don'tcha know I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Baby, I heard it through the grapevine
Ooh, I'm just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey, yeah
(Heard it through the grapevine)
(Not much longer would you be my baby)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Honey, honey, I know
That you're lettin' me go
(Heard it through the grapevine)
(Not much longer would you be my baby)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Said I heard it through the grapevine
Ooh, I heard it through the grapevine
(Heard it through the grapevine)
(Not much longer would you be my baby)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
