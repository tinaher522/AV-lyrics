<song artist="Marvin_Gaye" title="Always">
Everything went wrong
And the whole day long
I'd feel so blue
For the longest while
I'd forget to smile then I met you
Now that my blue days have passed
Now that I've found you at last
I'll be loving you always
With a love that's true always
When the things you've planned
Need a helping hand
I will understand always
Always
Days may not be fair always
That's when I'll be there always
Not for just an hour
Not for just a day
Not for just a year
But always
I'll be loving you, oh always
With a love that's true always
When the things you've planned
Need a helping hand
I will understand always
Always
Days may not be fair always
That's when I'll be there always
Not for just an hour
Not for just a day
Not for just a year
But always
Not for just an hour
Not for just a day
Not for just a year
But always
