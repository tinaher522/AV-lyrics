<song artist="Marvin_Gaye" title="Al-Ways">
Always and forever
Each moment with you
Is just like a dream to me
That somehow came true
And I know tomorrow
Will still be the same
'Cuz we got a life of love
That won't ever change
Everyday love me
Your own special way
Melt all my heart with a smile
Take time to tell me you really care
And we'll share tomorrow
Together, always forever love you
I'll always love you forever
Ever, ever, ever, baby
