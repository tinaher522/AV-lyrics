<song artist="Marvin_Gaye" title="Loving_You_Is_Sweeter_Than_Ever">
I remember yet before we met
Every night and day I had to live the life of a lonely one
Oh and I remember meeting you, discovering life could be true
When shared by two 'stead of one
When you said, you loved me, said oh darling
And we could not be parted, no way
Then I built my world around you, honey yeah
Ever since I found you darlin'
Loving you has made my life
Sweeter than ever, baby
And oh, loving you has made my life
Sweeter than ever, baby
Each day I pray, we'll never part
For the love within my heart grows stronger baby from day to day
As best I can, I'll always try to reassure and satisfy you
I'd be lost if you went away
Oh when you said, you loved me, honey yeah
And we could not be parted, no, no, no
Right then I built my world around you, yes I did
Ever since I found you honey
Baby you made my life so
So sweeter now baby
Loving you has made my life
Sweeter than ever, darlin' yeah, yeah
Honey when you said, you loved me, oh baby
And we could not be parted, oh
I built my world around you, honey
Ever since I found you, darlin'
Loving you, made my life
Sweeter than honey from the bee
You've been good to me
Just loving you has made my life
Sweeter than ever, oh baby
Baby, loving you
That's all I want to do
You made my life so sweeter
You made my life
