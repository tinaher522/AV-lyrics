<song artist="Marvin_Gaye" title="This_Love_Starved_Heart_Of_Mine_(Is_Killing_Me)">
Life's a nightmare and I can't stand it
Since you turned me lose
And you know without your loving
My life has no use
I know I made mistakes now baby
Thinking love would pull me through
Honey honey now my love starving heart is killing me
Darling since I lost you

Love starved heart of mine, killing me
Wanting you more than before
Love starved heart of mine, killing me
Don't turn me from your door

I guess you know I thrown my pride
Right down in the dirt
What else can I do now baby
Wont you come take away the hurt
Honey honey I got walls in my poor heart
Can't take it now that you're gone
Think I'm gon cave right in now honey
The pain is much too strong o

Love starved heart of mine, killing me
I seen you deal better dimes
Love starved heart of mine, killing me
Have pity on this heart of mine

Do ow! go head
Do baby

Life's a nightmare and I can't stand it
Since you turned me lose
And you know without your loving
My life has no use
I know I made mistakes now baby
Thinking love would pull me through
Honey honey now my love starving heart is killing me
Honey since I lost you

Love starved heart of mine, killing me
Wanting you more than before
Love starved heart of mine, killing me
Don't turn me from your door

Love starved heart of mine, killing me
I seen you deal better dimes
Love starved heart of mine, killing me
Have pity on this heart of mine
