<song artist="Marvin_Gaye" title="Here,_My_Dear">
I guess I'll have to say this album is dedicated to you
Although perhaps I may not've been happy
This is what you want
So I've conceded
All that makes you happy
There's a lot of truth in it, baby
I don't think I'll have many regrets, baby
Things didn't have to be the way they was, baby
You don't have the right to use the son of mine
To keep me in line
One thing I can't do without
Is the boy only God gave to both of us
I'm so happy ah for the son of mine
So here it is, baby
I hope you enjoy
Reminisce
Be happy
Think about the kisses and the joy
But there were those other moments, too
Where times were cloudy and grey
Then, ahh
That you taught me that was life
May love ever possess you
May peace come into your life
May you always think of me the way I was
I.. I was your baby
This is what you wanted
Here, my dear
Here it is
Here, my dear
Here it is
