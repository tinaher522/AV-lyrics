<song artist="Marvin_Gaye" title="Now_That_You've_Won_Me">
Now that you've won me 
I hope that you'll remember how
Don't you forget it (no, baby)
'Cause you know I love you now
Keep on being sweet and kind in the same old way
Keep on saying that you're mine, each and every day
Now that you've won me
Now that you've won me
Now that you've got me 
I hope our heartaches don't begin
I hope my heart was not just a bet you had to win
Keep on kissing me day and night
Don't you ever change
Keep holding me tight, baby
Don't you dare start acting strange
Now that you've won me
Now that you've got me
I felt it quite a while ago, but I had to say "no"
I wouldn't admit it to myself
But I guess it's right that the truth comes to the light
I'll admit, this is it, baby
I'll admit, this is it
Now that I'm yours 
I hope you keep me for you own
Don't misuse me and then leave me all alone
Keep on doing the things that you did when we first met
I hope you still remember them
I hope you don't forget
Now that you've won me
Now that I'm yours 
Now that you've got me
Now that you've won me
Now that I'm yours
