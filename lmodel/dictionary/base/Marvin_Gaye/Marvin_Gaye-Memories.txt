<song artist="Marvin_Gaye" title="Memories">
Memories, precious memories
Memories, precious memories
Memories, precious memories
Memories, precious memories
I recall a time as we used to sit for hours
Holding hands, I used to buy you flowers
With our hearts together
Nothing mattered
I remember dreams I had and plans we made
Oh I'd grow in love girl to cascade
Oh but the dreams are all shattered
What can I do now that your love has left my life
My dreams are cut to shreds by jealous, hateful lies
The knife was made of lies and schemes that we knew so well
To turn our glowing love into a cold and empty shell
Leaving me with memories, girl, and harmony
Memories, oh, how love ought to be
Oh, precious memories
Ooh baby, precious memories
I was a fool, I know
Honey and don't it show?
It can't help but shine
Here is a grown man crying
Mixed up in confusion
So badly disillusioned
This precious love I've had
Slipped away so fast
Now the plan is gone and there's a reasonable substitute
I just saw myself crying, it didn't look too cute
I found a single blood you dropped and you hate to part
I used it to press my tears and held it to my heart
It brought back memories
Reminding me how love used to be
Memories, precious memories
Memories, precious memories
Memories, precious memories
Memories, precious memories
