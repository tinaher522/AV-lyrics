<song artist="Marvin_Gaye" title="Never_Let_You_Go_(Sha_Lu_Bop)">
Boop, pop, ba, loo, pop
You sing along, my baby and my love
For you are my love
You are my lady
You say that you need me only
So I come on back to you, baby
Cause you can hold my hand so sweet
The way you hold me in your arms
It's crazy, it's been all along
Said I'd never
I'd never, let you go
Boop, pop, ba, loo pop
Baby, oh, my baby
I love you so, yes I do
And there is one thing that I wanna know
That I love you 
And I will never let you go
Ah, you been so good to me, baby
And you can hold my hand so sweet
The way you hold me in your arms
It's crazy
It's been all along
Said I'd never
I'd never, let you go
Boop, pop, ba, loo, pop
