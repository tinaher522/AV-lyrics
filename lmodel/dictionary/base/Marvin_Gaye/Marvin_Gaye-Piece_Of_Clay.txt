<song artist="Marvin_Gaye" title="Piece_Of_Clay">
Father stop criticizing your son
Mother please leave your daughters alone
Don't you see that's what wrong
With the world with world today
Everybody wants somebody
To be their own piece of clay
Everybody wants somebody
To be their own piece of clay
We all talked about Candice
But it's only, only a word, truly
Brother turned on a sister in this cruel, cruel world
That's what's wrong with all in this world today
Everybody wants somebody
To be their own piece of clay
Oh, everybody wants somebody
To be their own piece of clay
Somebody to play with
Wanna to mold you, mold you
Shake your love baby
Wanna to do their thing
Children are told
To give and not just to take
If we were all children
You know the world will be a better place
Oh, everybody wants somebody
To be their own piece of clay
We should all love each other
Love and take one another
We should love each other
Love and not hate, oh
Everybody wants somebody
To be their own piece of clay
Everybody wants somebody
To be their own piece of clay
Truly everybody wants somebody
To mold them, shape them own way
Everybody wants somebody
Try to make it or, do their, do their thing
Everybody wants to take somebody
Got to make it, make it do their thing
Everybody wants somebody
To be their own piece of clay, yeah
Somebody, somebody
Own piece of clay
Somebody, somebody
Somebody, somebody, somebody
Somebody, somebody
Somebody, somebody, somebody
