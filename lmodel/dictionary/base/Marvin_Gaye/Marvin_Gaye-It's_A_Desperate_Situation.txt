<song artist="Marvin_Gaye" title="It's_A_Desperate_Situation">
Honey, your love is gone, I know your love is gone
It's a desperate situation
Now I'm all alone, I'm all alone
It's a desperate situation
I'm without happiness, without tenderness
Without the love we used to share
I spend eternity reliving memories
'cause the truth is just too much to bear
Now that you don't love me, you love someone new
Death could be no worse than what I've been going through
Girl, this life of mine is just a waste of time
It's a desperate situation
Oh, it's a lonely world without your loving, girl
It's a desperate situation
I'm a dreamer now, just a dreamer now
'cause it hurts so much when I awake
But in dreams of you, girl there's no-one new
I'm still the only man you take
Night after night I lay staring at the ceiling
Wondering where you are, who you're with and what you're feeling
Oh, I've been forgotten, Lord knows I can't forget
It's a desperate situation
Oh, this foolish heart of mine still loves you, yeah
It's a desperate situation
Oh, come back, baby
Come save me, baby
Night after night I lay staring at the ceiling
Wondering where you are, who you're with and what you're feeling
Oh, I've been forgotten, Lord knows I can't forget
It's a desperate situation
Oh, this foolish heart of mine still loves you, yeah
It's a desperate situation
Oh, this life of mine is just a waste of time
It's a desperate situation
