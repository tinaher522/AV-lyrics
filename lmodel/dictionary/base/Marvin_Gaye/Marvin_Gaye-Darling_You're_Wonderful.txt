<song artist="Marvin_Gaye" title="Darling_You're_Wonderful">
Words seem to fail me
Whenever you are near
I've got to get myself together
And tell you how much I care
'cause when you look at me
I get weak in my knees
My heart won't let me be
Won't you help me, please
I really love you
Darling, you're wonderful
Darling, you're wonderful
You are so divine
You're my heavenly dream
You're a cool, cool breeze
That caress me on a hot summer night
I suffer so much, baby
When you're out of my sight
So baby come to my arms
Let me thrill to your charms
So I won't be alone
You'll be the queen on my throne, baby
Darling, you're wonderful
Darling, you're wonderful
The Spinners would say:
You're a sweet thing, baby
You're a sweet, sweet thing
Stevie Wonder would say:
You are uptight
Clean out of sight
Sam Cooke would say:
I know, I know, I know, I know
You know that I know you're wonderful
