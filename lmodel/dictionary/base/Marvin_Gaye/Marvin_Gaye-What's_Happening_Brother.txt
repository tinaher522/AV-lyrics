<song artist="Marvin_Gaye" title="What's_Happening_Brother">
Hey baby, what you know good?
I'm just gettin' back, but you knew I would
War is hell, when will it end?
When will people start gettin' together again
Are things really gettin' better
Like the newspaper said
What else is new my friend
Besides what I've read
Can't find no work, can't find no job my friend
Money is tighter than it's ever been
Hey man I just don't understand
What's goin' on across this land
Ah, what's happenin' brother
Hey, what's happenin', what's happenin' my man
Are they still gettin' down where we used to go and dance
Will our ballclub win the pennant,
Do you think they they have a chance?
And tell me friend,
"How in the world have you been?"
Tell me what's out
'Cause I wanna' know what's in
What's the deal man, what's happenin'
What's happenin' brother
Ah, what's happenin' brother
What's happenin', my man?
Whoo, ah, ah, what's happenin' brother
Say man, whoo, what's happenin' brother
What's been shakin' up and down the line...
I wanna' know, 'cause I'm slightly behind the times
