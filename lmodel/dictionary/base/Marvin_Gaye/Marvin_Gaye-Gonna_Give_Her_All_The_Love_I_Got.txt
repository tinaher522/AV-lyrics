<song artist="Marvin_Gaye" title="Gonna_Give_Her_All_The_Love_I_Got">
There's a train leaving here tomorrow
(Leaving here)
And I'll be a free, free man once again
(A free man)
I'm so glad I served my time
I'm gonna meet the girl that I left behind
And when I see her, I'm gonna give her
All the love I've got
Ooh, when I see her, I'm gonna give her
Little girl, all the love I've got
There were times, there were times
When each day seems like a year
But the sweet things she said in her letters
Made the times disappear, oh yeah
She said, "No one's arms will I let hold me
'Cause in your arms is where I want to be"
So when I see her, I'm gonna give her
Little girl, all the love I've got
Ooh, when I see her all the love I've got
(I'm gonna give her all)
Ooh, baby, baby, baby, I miss you so
Countless nights I stared out my window
At the moonlight, yes I did now
Thinking about the way I used to hold her tight, oh yeah
I must've been out of my mind to do the wrong I did
And leave her behind
So when I see her, I'm gonna give her
All the love I've got
Woo, when I see her, I'm gonna give her
Little girl, all the love I've got
Believe me when I tell ya
When I see her, I'm gonna give her
All the love I've got
