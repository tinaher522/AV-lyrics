<song artist="Marvin_Gaye" title="Some_Kind_Of_Wonderful">
All you have to do is touch my hand
To show me you understand
And something happens to me
That's some kind of wonderful
At any time my little world seems blue
I just have to look at you
And everything seems to be
Some kind of wonderful
I know I can't express
This feeling of tenderness
There's so much I wanna say
But the right words don't come my way
I only know when I'm in your embrace
And this world seems a better place
And something happens to me
And there's some kind of wonderful
And it's wonderful baby,
It's wonderful
Oh, so divine!
I know I can't express
This feeling of tenderness
And there's so much I wanna say
But the right words just don't come my way
I only know when I'm in your embrace
This world seems a better place
And something happens to me
There's some kind of wonderful
And it's wonderful, baby
Oh, so divine.
Oh, baby.
And it's wonderful, baby, baby, baby, baby.
I understand
And it's some kind of wonderful
And it's wonderful, baby, baby, baby, baby, please.
You know it's some kind of wonderful, oh baby.
So much I wanna say...
