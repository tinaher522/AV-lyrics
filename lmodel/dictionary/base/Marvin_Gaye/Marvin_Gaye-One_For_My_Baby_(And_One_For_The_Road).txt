<song artist="Marvin_Gaye" title="One_For_My_Baby_(And_One_For_The_Road)">
It's quarter to three
There's no one in the place except you and me
So set 'em up, Joe
I got a little story I think you should know
We're drinking, my friend
To the end of a brief episode
Make it one for my baby
And one more for the road
I got the routine
Put another nickel in the machine
Feeling so bad
Won't you make the music easy and sad?
I could tell you a lot, but it's not
In a gentleman's code
Just make it one for my baby
And one more for the road
You'd never know it, but buddy, I'm a kind of poet
And I've got a lot of things I'd like to say
And when I'm gloomy
Won't ya listen to me till it's talked away?
Well, that's how it goes
And Joe, I know you're gettin' anxious to close
Thanks for the cheer
I hope you didn't mind my bending your ear
But this torch that I found, it's gotta be drowned
Or it soon might explode
Make it one for my baby
And one more for the road
Long, it's so long, winding road
