<song artist="Marvin_Gaye" title="Hitch_Hike">
I'm goin' to Chicago
That's the last place my baby stayed
(Hitch hike) Hitch hike (Hitch hike, baby)
I'm packin' up my bags, gonna leave this old town right away
(Hitch hike) Hitch hike (Hitch hike, baby)
I've got to find that girl, if I have to hitch hike round the world
(Hitch hike) Hitch hike
Hmm ...
Chicago City Limits, that's what the sign on the highway read
(Hitch hike) Hitch hike (Hitch hike, baby)
I'm gonna keep movin' till I get to that street called 63rd
(63rd. Hitch hike, baby) Hitch hike, yeah
I've got to find that girl if I have to hitch hike round the world
(Hitch hike) Hitch hike, baby
Come on, children . . .
Hitch hike (Hitch hike) Now hitch a ride (Hitch hike, baby)
Hitch a ride (Hitch hike) Hitch hike, children (Hitch hike, children)
Hitch hike (Hitch hike) Hitch hike (Hitch hike dance)
Yeah, hitch hike (Hitch hike) Hitch hike, children  
(Hitch hike baby. Hitch hike, children)
(Hitch hike baby. Hitch hike, children)
(Hitch hike, baby. Hitch hike, baby)
I'm goin' to St. Louis, but my next stop just might be L.A.
(Hitch hike) Now what'd I say? (L.A.)
Got no money in my pocket so I'm gonna have to hitch hike all the way
(On my way) Yeah (Hitch hike, baby)
I've got to find that girl if I have to hitch hike round the world
(Hitch hike)
Now what'd I say?
Come on, hitch hike (Hitch hike, baby)
Come hitch hike, children (Hitch hike, children)
Hitch hike (Hitch hike, baby)
Now hitch hike, baby (Hitch hike, children)
Hitch hike (Hitch hike, baby)
Hitch hike, baby (Hitch hike, baby)
Now hitch hike (Hitch hike)
Do the hitch hike
Come on, hitch hike (Hitch hike, baby)
Now Hitch hike, children (Hitch hike, children)
Hitch hike (Hitch hike, baby)
Hitch hike (Hitch hike, children)
Hitch hike (Hitch hike, baby)
Hitch hike (Hitch hike, children)
(and fade)
