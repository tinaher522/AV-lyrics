<song artist="Marvin_Gaye" title="Hitchhike">
I'm goin' to Chicago
That's the last place my baby strayed
(Hitchhike)
Hitchhike
(Hitchhike, baby)
I'm packin' up my bags
Gonna leave this old town right away
(Hitchhike)
Hitchhike
(Hitchhike, baby)
I've got to find that girl
If I have to hitchhike 'round the world
(Hitchhike)
Hitchhike
Chicago City Limits
That's what the sign on the highway read
(Hitchhike)
Hitchhike
(Hitchhike, baby)
I'm gonna keep movin'
Till I get to that street corner 6th and 3rd
(6th and 3rd, hitch hike, baby)
Hitchhike, yeah
I've got to find that girl
If I have to hitchhike 'round the world
(Hitchhike)
Hitchhike, baby
Hitchhike
(Hitchhike)
Now, hitchhike
(Hitchhike, baby)
It's alright
(Hitchhike)
Hitchhike, chillen
Hitchhike, chillen)
Hitchhike
(Hitchhike)
Hitchhike
(Hitchhike, dance)
Yeah, hitchhike
(Hitchhike)
Hitchhike, chillen
(Hitchhike, baby, hitchhike chillen)
(Hitchhike, baby, hitchhike chillen)
(Hitchhike, baby, hitchhike, baby)
I'm goin' to St. Louis
But my next stop just might be L.A.
(Hitchhike)
Now, what'd I say?
(l.a.)
Got no money in my pocket
So I'm gonna have to hitchhike all the way
(All the way)
Yeah
(Hitchhike, baby)
I've got to find that girl
If I have to hitchhike 'round the world
(Hitchhike)
Now, what'd I say
Come on, hitchhike
(Hitchhike, baby)
Come, hitchhike, chillen
(Hitchhike, chillen)
Come on, hitchhike
(Hitchhike, baby)
Come, hitchhike, chillen
(Hitchhike, chillen)
Come on, hitchhike
(Hitchhike, baby)
Come, hitchhike, chillen
(Hitchhike, chillen)
