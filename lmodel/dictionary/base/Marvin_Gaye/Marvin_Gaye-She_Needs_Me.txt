<song artist="Marvin_Gaye" title="She_Needs_Me">
No, I don't know the girl at the bar in the short red dress
I haven't had the chance to get acquainted with her yet
But I can tell that she's lonely by the sadness in her eyes
And she needs more than just a drink tonight
She needs me to give her love and understanding
Some good old country love and nothing else
She needs me to throw my loving arms around her
And tonight I could use some love myself
Each time she turns up the glass
She drinks a memory from the past
And sadness becomes a teardrop in her eye
But she won't have to leave alone
'Cause tonight I'm takin' her home
Wrapped up in these lonely arms of mine
For she needs me to give her love and understanding
Some good old fashioned love and nothing else
She needs me to throw my loving arms around her
And tonight I could use some love myself
Yes, tonight I could use some love myself
