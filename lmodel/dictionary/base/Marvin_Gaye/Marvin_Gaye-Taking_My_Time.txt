<song artist="Marvin_Gaye" title="Taking_My_Time">
Taking my time making up my mind
Choosing the girl that's suppose it have to love me forever
I'm gonna make sure
That she has a heart of gold yeah
And the love to whole me
Falling, that's way I'm taking it slow
Coz I wanna know if it that kind of love
That's gonna last me forever
Don't gonna waste precious time
Don't play lovers part, coz I one day end up with a broken heart
No, no, no, no, no, not me, not me, not I, not me
Do you believe?
I wise man once told me a long time ago
'If a women don't love you, let her go'
I don't need you baby
That's way I'm taking it slow
Coz I wanna know if it that kind of love
That's gonna last me forever
Don't gonna waste precious time
Don't play lovers part, coz I one day end up with a broken heart
No, no, no, no, no, not me, not me,  not I, not me
Taking my time making up my mind
Choosing, choosing
