<song artist="Marvin_Gaye" title="What_You_Gave_Me_(With_Tammi_Terrell)">
Like a breath of spring you came
And as you leave, I can only sigh your name
Cries of anguish echo from way down
But will never reach my lips to make a sound
Though it seems my world is crumblin'
Honey, you don't owe me anything
'Cause what you gave me, girl
Is more than enough to last, oh yes it is
And what you gave me, girl
Is more than enough to last, oh yes it is
You've given me so much warmth
I don't see how I could ever grow cold
In my mind, there's a picture of you and I
That nobody has the price to buy
I don't know what made you change your mind
But you'll be back, it's just a matter of time
'Cause what you gave me
Is more than enough to last, oh yeah
And what you gave me
Is more than enough to last
Into my life you came like a breath of spring
Givin' me a song to sing, oh yeah, oh yeah
And though I know you're leavin'
I won't be grievin' 'cause I know
Time has a way of showin' us
The things we really need
And no matter where you go
I know you'll find your way back home, oh baby
Though I know it's not reality
You'll always be a part of me
'Cause what you gave me
Is more than enough to last, oh, yeah, yeah
And what you gave me, hey
Is more than enough to last
I believe that what you gave me
Is more than enough to last
I love you, I love you
Hey, now and what you gave me
Is more than enough to last
Is more than enough, hey now
And what you gave me baby
Is more than enough to last
