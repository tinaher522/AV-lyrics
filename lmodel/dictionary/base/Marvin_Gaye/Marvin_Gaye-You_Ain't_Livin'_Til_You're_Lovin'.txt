<song artist="Marvin_Gaye" title="You_Ain't_Livin'_Til_You're_Lovin'">
You think you're so way out
And you got all the action
Still you can't find no satisfaction
Baby - try me, and I'll make you see
You ain't livin' until you're lovin', baby
You ain't livin' until you're lovin', baby
Ooh, until you fall you ain't livin' at all
Ah ah, at all
You like to kiss and run
And that's where it is
'Cause somebody told you
Love was heartaches and tears
Baby, although you're free
I'll make you see
You ain't livin' until you're lovin', baby
You ain't livin' until you're lovin', baby
Oh, until you fall you ain't livin' at all
You ain't livin' at all
To be in love, I know it's not your ambition
But before you go, think about my proposition
You may conquer the world and be king on a throne
But you still ain't nobody, baby
When you're sittin' all alone
You ain't livin' until you're lovin', baby
You ain't livin' until you're lovin', baby
Ooh, until you fall you ain't livin' at all
You ain't livin' until you're lovin', baby
You ain't livin' until you're lovin', baby
Ooh, until you fall you ain't livin' at all
