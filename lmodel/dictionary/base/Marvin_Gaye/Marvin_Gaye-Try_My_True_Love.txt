<song artist="Marvin_Gaye" title="Try_My_True_Love">
you find it all confusing
and you find that you are only loosing
try, try
c'mon, try my true love
try, try
c'mon, try my true love
baby if you're walking down on a one way road
and heartaches are your heavy load
don't you let it get you down
it's time to start looking around
and if you're looking for sincerity
c'mon girl look at me
if you love's treated you unkind
I'm gonna make things right this time
if you go hard after the cold
c'mon, 
c'mon try my true love
everything has gotten out of control
c'mon baby try my true love
honey don't lock your heart inside
a heart should always feel alive
with happiness flowing free
full of love and never, never empty
so leave all the dawn behind
if it doesn't love you girl
try to find
don't look back and be mislead
take my hand, future lies ahead
ohh baby
if you're looking for love and can't find it
c'mon try my true love 
don't let happiness pass you by
take a step forward baby
you got to try
honey you got to try
put your heart in my hand
and I'll help you understand
the darkness can be the light
if you go about it right
that don't need to be apart
I'll be waiting with open arms
if you leave past behind you
c'mon try my true love 
if you're looking for love and can't find it
c'mon try my true love 
if you are walking down a one way road
c'mon try my true love
