<song artist="Marvin_Gaye" title="At_Last_(I_Found_A_Love)">
at last
at last
I've found the love for me
into my life she came, people
a life full of dreary
bring in all the sun shine
on the vary soul of me
at last
at last
I've found the love for me
I knew right away
as soon as our eyes first met
that a heart of mine
would soon intertwine
till our love the woman
never forget
your love
your love
your love is mine
she's sweet
so sweet
she is the apple of my eyes
her lips are like rubys
and she's stand tall so high
when she kisses me I feel the thunder
at last
at last
I've found the love for me
every body needs someone to love
I'm so glad that I found mine
there is someone there for everyone
it's only a matter of time
at last
at last
I've found the love for me
