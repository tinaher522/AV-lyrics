<song artist="Marvin_Gaye" title="Please_Stay_(Once_You_Go_Away)">
Stay babe please stay
Don't go away baby
Don't go away please stay
Stay, please stay baby
Don't go away
Don't go away
Don't go away
I'm askin' you darlin'
Please stay, please stay, please
Don't go away baby (ooh)
Please stay, please
Don't go away, no
I couldn't stand it darlin'
I won't be able to sleep peacefully
In bed without beside me
Darlin', darlin anymore
No, sugar, no
I won't be warm and secure
Oh baby baby like I was before
Oh baby
I'll just lie tossin' and turnin'
Tossin' and turnin'
Tossin' and turnin'
All night long
Scared that if I closed my eyes
When I got ready to wake up
I might find you gone
Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo
Stay babe please stay
Don't go away baby
Don't go away please stay
Cause I could never find
Nobody
To make me feel this way
No, sugar
For I never felt this way
Before
No, no sugar you did it
Oh I never felt so good
Honey before
Oh I never felt so good
Oh before
