<song artist="Marvin_Gaye" title="Need_Somebody">
oh well I'm the kind of guy that always need
some body
oh well I'm the kind of guy that tries to keep me
some one
Oh some body
some one to walk with
to talk with
to all mu troubles due
some body
hey angel
don't you tell me that you
when you get ready
I'll give you love
I'll give you everything I got
if you tell me that you will be my
some body
I thought I love you
I'll give you everything I got
have you ever had a feeling that you wanna hold
some body
Baby I got that feeling, I got that whole
some body
Someone to stand by me
to try me
I'll never let you down
