<song artist="Marvin_Gaye" title="It_Don't_Take_Much_To_Keep_Me">
don't take much
don't take much
yeah to keep me
I don't like much
just your touch
just your tenderness
just your sweet caress
ohh
just the pleasure of your company
when I'll feel a little lonely, to comfort me
justo to call you and know you are there
take me through my day 
if you worry about me leaving
throw it out of your mind
as long as you want me I'll be right by your side
don't take much
just your touch
yeah to keep me
baby you got it
you got it baby
got what it takes
it takes to keep me
to keep me
when the days go by and I don't see you darling
I might start to complain
but all you gotta do is talk to me sweet and plain
let me know what your loving means
just say you need me, just like I need you
thats enough to carry me through
you are my world
you are my everything
you are my eyes can see
you're such a part of me
it's the little things you do
that keeps me loving you
it ain't what you saying 
is the sweet way you're saying
just let me know you're standing by
to what my eyes, I'll be satisfied
you are my world, you are my everything
you are all my eyes can see
oh baby, you are such a part of me
don't take much
just your touch
yeah to keep me
baby you got it
you got it baby
got what it takes
it takes to keep me
to keep me
just your tenderness
that's enough baby
