When did you love me
I want to know the truth
It's never hard to get it up for you
Why did you have it and is it all the same
Oh my sweet darling did you forget your name
Oh you call it a thrill
I never knew, and then you never will
Oh one big mistake now I see
I started off thinking that you belonged to me
Cold blooded lovers waiting for the night
Exploring my treasure, got me so uptight
Your fault that I'm
Feeling all insane
Once we were happy
And then the devil came
Oh baby, oh baby
First you make believe your mine
Oh babe, oh baby
Then you make me feel like dying. Ooh ooh
Once upon a time you said I set your soul on fire
I called you my honey
You were my one desire
I let you nestle too deep within my soul
I can't believe I let you take control
Oh my sweet baby don't wait too late
Tell me you love me and cure my heart ache
I never thought I'd be put in this squeeze
Your trying to bring me to my bended knee
Don't start buggin'
Don't criticize
Folks that love you
Right before your eyes
You stopped me
Got to let you go
Got to be heard
Got to love you so
Got to give you some
Just before you leave
Got to feed my fire
Uh ah, uh ah
Ok let me hear that back
C'mon ya'll lets go
Come on sweet darlin' you say you don't care
Dance all your heart aches far away from here
You used to be so real
Ah I used to be your only thrill baby
Ah it used to be so real
You never loved me and you never will
But I'll always love you cause that's the way I feel
And we just can't help it cause that's the way it is
So let's be happy
Fly 'n be happy
Love 'n be happy
Dance, whooooo
Oh let's be happy
Let's laugh 'n be happy
Let's live 'n be happy
Dance, whoooo
For life is happy
And love is happy
To sing is happy
Dance, whoooo
Let's be happy
Let's laugh 'n be happy
Let's love 'n be happy
Dance, whoooo
Keep on rising higher baby and you'll stay happy
Gotta stay happy
Happy
Oh baby
Got to pray and meditate
Got to pray and meditate
Havin' a love party
Got to pray and meditate
Havin' a love party
Let's love 'n be happy
Oh Life is happy
And love is happy
Live 'n be happy
Dance
