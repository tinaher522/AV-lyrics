<song artist="Marvin_Gaye" title="Everybody_Needs_Love">
See those flowers, they need love
See the bluebirds, they need love
See the babies, they need love
All God's children, oh need love
See your mother, she needs love
And my father, he needs love
That's true baby, and I need love too
See those raindrops, rivers - they need love
and the mountains and the valleys, they need love
God forgive us, and send us more love from above
Don't find good love every day
We ought to think before we throw good love away
Doesn't matter what you are
A thief or a beggar or even a superstar
As long as the Lord made you from above Oh, I know, I know 
You need love
We need love
Oh baby (oh, I need love, I need your love) 
I'm standing here (Oh baby, standing in the need) 
of love (I need love)
I need it, I got to have it baby 
Oh can't you see that I'm standing in the need 
I'm still here cause I need love 
I'm still with you dear
cause I need your love 
and I know, oh yes I know
Though you feel you don't need loving 
(We need love, we need love)
You still need loving too
Oh yes you do
(It don't matter, It don't matter)
No, it doesn't matter what you are
A thief or a beggar or a superstar
As long as the Lord made you from above
I know, I know 
You were made for love
(Cause love is what you really need 
and understanding)
Oh, understanding  
You were made for love
Sweet understanding 
You were made for love
Why can't we see 
Why does it have to be so hard today 
for us to see the real
Why can't we see
We were made from love
You were made from love
I'm talking about love
The real thing
You were made of love
By love, from love, baby
Right
What's the only thing that's gonna get us together 
Love's the only thing that's gonna make this cold-blooded world alright 
What are we talkin' about? 
Love, love, love, love
Oh baby
What is this we're singing about? 
For the love of Jesus, let's do it 
Sweet love
I need a whole lot of love, sugar
I need a whole lot of sweet love 
It's a fact
Even the slimy seal needs love (who)
All of the folks in jail need love (who) 
Even a mean old man needs love
Why can't you understand that I need love?
