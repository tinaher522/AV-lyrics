<song artist="Marvin_Gaye" title="You're_The_One_For_Me">
Maybe there'll come a time when I won't be sad and lonely
just suppose I could love you from the very start, maybe
heaven knows I could show you with an open heart, baby
you're the one that I've been waiting for
in this loneliness forever more
baby, I know you're the one for me
can it be that you're needing me as I need you, honey?
(promise me)
promise me if we part and I never knew, funny
deep inside my heart I hope and pray
that someday you'll come to me and say
"baby, I know you're the one for me"
maybe there'll come a time when I won't be sad and lonely
love is strong and i'm betting that it will come my way, gladly
if i'm wrong and mistaken, then i'll have to pay, sadly
no other love could ever be the same
if we fail, there's just yourself to blame
oh baby, I know you're the one for me
maybe there'll come a time when I won't be sad and lonely
so lonely
maybe there'll come a time when I won't be sad and lonely
you're the one for me
you're the one for me
all of my life
you're the one for me
i'll never have another love
you're the one for me
for the rest of my life
you're the one for me
