<song artist="Marvin_Gaye" title="Sandman">
Mr. Sandman, bring me a dream
Make her the cutest that I've ever seen
Give her two lips like roses and clover
Then tell her that her lonesome nights are over
Sandman, I'm so alone
Don't have nobody to call my own
Please turn on your magic beam
Mr. Sandman, bring me a dream
Mr. Sandman, bring me a dream
Make her the cutest that I've ever seen
Give her the word that I'm not a rover
Then tell her that her lonesome nights are over
Sandman, I'm so alone
Don't have nobody to call my own
Please turn on your magic beam
Mr. Sandman, bring me a dream
Mr. Sandman, someone to hold
Would be so peachy before I'm too old
So please turn on your magic beam
Mr. Sandman, bring me, please, please, please
Mr. Sandman, bring me a dream
