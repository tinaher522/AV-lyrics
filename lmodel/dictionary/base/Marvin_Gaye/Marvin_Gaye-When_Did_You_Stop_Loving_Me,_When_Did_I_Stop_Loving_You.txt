<song artist="Marvin_Gaye" title="When_Did_You_Stop_Loving_Me,_When_Did_I_Stop_Loving_You">
You know, when you say your marriage vows
They're supposed to be for real, I mean
Well if you think back about what you really said, y'know about 
honour and loving and obeying 
until death do us part and all
But it shouldn't be that way, 
it should, it shouldn't be lies 
because though it turns out to be lies
and if you don't honour what you said
You've lied to God
The words should be changed
Now as I recall
We tried a million times 
Again again and again
And that isn't all
I gave my love to you
Each time to make amends
Suddenly, I start to realise
I can't make it
Pretty birds
Fly away
I have to leave you
For my heart's sake
What to do
Make you pay
For leaving you my fine
Is to pay forever
So if a fresh new love comes in
I won't say those words again
Instead I'll say I tried to love and protect you
With all my heart long as you want me to, baby
If I love again
I'm gonna try a new way this time
Memories of the things we did
Some we're proud of, some we hid
So when two people have to part
Sometimes it makes them stronger
Do you remember all of the
pushy things
You say you love with all your heart
If you ever loved me 
with all of your heart
You'd never take a million
dollars to part
I really tried
You know I tried, oh baby
Although we tried
All of those promises
Was nothing but lies
And I really tried
You know how hard I tried
We really lied, didn't we baby
And on top of that
You have scandalised my name
What I can't understand is if you love me
How could you turn me into the police
Didn't I love you good
and try to take care of you best I could
You were so refined
and your love is like mellow wine
Pains of love miles of tears
Enough to last me for my lifetime
Broken hearts last for years
so break away to the new day sunshine
One thing I can promise, friend
I'll never be back again
But I'm not really bitter, baby
I wish you all the luck and all the good love in the world
(Good love in the world)
But I know you'll never be satisfied
No, just to have me standing by your side
Memories haunt you all the time
I will never leave your mind
You got judgement on your side
You say bad things and you've lied
Still I remember some of the good things baby
like love after dark and beatniks in parks
Those are the days I'd like to forget 
in my life
I'd rather remember
Remember the joy we shared, baby
I'd rather remember
all the fun we had
All I ever really wanted was 
to love you and treat you right 
All we did was fuss and fight
It don't matter, baby
Take a lesson from them all
I never thought I'd see the day
when you put me through what you put me through
You try your best
You say I gave you no rest
When did you stop loving me
When did I stop loving you
When did you stop loving me
When did I stop loving you
Oh, when did you stop loving me
When did I stop loving you
