<song artist="Marvin_Gaye" title="Just_A_Little_Love_(Before_My_Life_Is_Gone)">
Just a little love
Before my life is gone
Just a little love
Every flower needs a little water
Before it can bloom
Every bit of darkness needs some sunshine
To brighten up the gloom
Every lonely heart needs a little love
To keep it beating strong
And all I want is a little loving
Before my life is gone
Just a little love
Before my life is gone
Every rainbow needs a little colour
To brighten up the day
Every baby robin needs some teaching
Before he can fly away
Every lonely heart needs someone to love
To keep its purpose strong
And all I want is someone to love me
Before my life is gone
Just a little love
Before my life is gone
Every lonely man needs a loving woman
To keep his purpose strong
And all I need is someone to love me
Before my life is gone
Just a little love
Before my life is gone
Just a little love
Before my life is gone
