<song artist="Marvin_Gaye" title="Lucky,_Lucky_Me">
Lady Love sure smiled on me
 When she blessed me with your lovin' charms
 I found my place in the sun
 Sweet heaven here in your arms 
I'm so lucky baby, so lucky 
Honey, lucky to be loved by you 
And I thank you baby 
For all the loving things you do
 I gotta tell the world about it 
I wanna stand right up and shout it Well lucky me 
Well lucky, lucky me, ooh baby
  I don't mind stormy weather
 For there ain't no wrong that makes me blue 
And I don't mind if my friends get together
 And leave me out of everything, everything they do 
It's alright baby, if the sun don't shine
 It's impossible to darken my day 
'Cause it doesn't matter to me if I don't get there
 For I'll be wealthy anyway
 Because I know you belong to me 
Well I know baby as long as I got you
 Oh lucky me, baby, lucky me, baby  
In my life there's no misfortune
No trouble knocks down my way 
You're my girl, my guiding star 
Just your smile can chase my blues away 
I can't help it baby, you're so wonderful
 How lucky can one man be
 Oh when you hold me in your sweet embrace
 And they all belong to me 
I gotta tell the world about it
 Honey, I'm gonna stand right up and shout it 
Oh lucky me, baby, lucky lucky me 
Oh I've been blessed with you baby
 Lucky lucky me
Baby, listen, heaven sent you my way 
Oh, lucky lucky me, baby, baby 
Honey, honey, I've been blessed, yeah
 By your lucky charms...
