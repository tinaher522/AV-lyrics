<song artist="Marvin_Gaye" title="Night_Life">
In the evening
When the sun goes down
Oh...you'll find me
Hangin'round
Cause the nightlife
Aint no good life
But it's my life....oh...yes it is
Many people just like you and me
Are dreamin'about....how things used to be
But the nightlife ain't no good life
But it's my life
Listen to the blues
They're playin'
Listen to the blues
To what's saying...
Hie...yeah......
Home,it's just another place
Oh...from that world of broken dreams
Yes the nightlife ain't no good life
But it's my life... oh yes it is
Sometimes it's sad...
Then again it's happy..oh..mmmm sometimes
