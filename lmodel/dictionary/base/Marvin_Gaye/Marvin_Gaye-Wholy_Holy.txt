<song artist="Marvin_Gaye" title="Wholy_Holy">
Wholy holy
Come together
Wholy holy
People, we've got to come together
And I know with the strength, power and all the feeling
Wholy holy
Wholy holy
Oh Lord, come on get together, one another
Oh Lord
Wholy holy
Wholy holy
Wholy holy we believe in one another
Wholy holy we believe in Jesus 
Jesus left a long time ago, said he would return
He left us a book to believe in
In it, we've got an awful lot to learn
Oh, wholy holy
(Oh Lord)
We can conquer hate forever, We (Yes, we can)
Ah, wholy holy (Oh, Lord)
We can rock the world's foundation
Yes we can
Better believe it
Wholy holy together, together and wholy
We holler "Love! Love!" across the nation
Oh, oh
Wholy holy
We proclaim love, our salvation
Ahh Huh, Oooh, Ooooh!
