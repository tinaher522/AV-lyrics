<song artist="Marvin_Gaye" title="Purple_Snowflakes">
Softly they fall, where do they go?
(purple snowflakes)
Cover the ground, without a sound
(gentle snowflakes)
Fall from the sky, before your eyes
(it's so thrilling)
Blankets of white, brighten the night
(such a feeling)
They seem to say, that our love is
Here to stay
We'll be cozy and warm until summer
Flowers bloom
Here in our midst, we're surely blessed
(chestnuts roasting)
Over the heat, gee ain't life sweet?
(tootsies toasting)
Drifting on air, without a care
(purple snowflakes)
Cover the ground, without a sound
(love the snowflakes)
I'm sure that snowflakes, fall from the
Gloom
I will always remember this night,
Here with you
There snowflakes, pretty purple
Snowflakes
Snowflakes, pretty purple
Snowflakes
Here in our midst, we're surely blessed
(chestnuts roasting)
Over the heat, gee ain't life sweet?
(tempters toasting)
Drifting on air, without a care
(purple snowflakes)
Cover the ground, without a sound
(love the snowflakes)
I'm sure that snowflakes, fall from the
Gloom
I will always remember this night,
Here with you
And I say snowflakes, pretty purple
Snowflakes
I'll always Remember the snowflakes
And you baby, and you
Snowflakes are falling, falling,
Falling..
And I got you in my arms
