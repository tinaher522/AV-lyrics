<song artist="Marvin_Gaye" title="Why_Did_I_Choose_You">
You are just too cold
You were cold as ice
You wasn't very nice
Why did I choose you? What did I see in you?
I saw the heart for that you hide so well
I saw a quiet girl, who had a gentle way
And it touched me in its glowing spell
Why did I want you? What could you offer me?
Just a love to last my life-time through?
And when I lost my heart baby, so many years ago
I lost it lovingly and willingly to you
And if I had to choose again
I would still choose you
