<song artist="Marvin_Gaye" title="No_Good_Without_You">
Before you walk away
Here's one thing I've got to say
I'll be no good without you baby
I'll be no good without you baby
I got money and I got fame
But if you leave me they don't mean a thing
That's why I'm begging baby, please don't go
That's why I'm trying girl to let you know
That's why I'm trying babe to make you see
Just how much, how much you mean to me
I'll be no good without you baby
I'll be no good without you baby
your loving me, ten feet tall
your leave me nothing at all
what did I do baby, to make you go
what did I say baby, to hurt you so
what's gotten between us baby can it be
somebody's stole your love from me 
Oh baby, baby please don't leave me
If you leave me baby I'll live in misery
And I'll be no good without you baby
I'll be no good without you baby
Take my money and take my fame
'cause if you leave me they don't mean a thing
But I'll keep on begging baby please don't go
I'll love you harder than I did before
Know I've been trying when you close the door
'cause I know, I know when you go
