<song artist="Marvin_Gaye" title="Trouble_Man">
I come up hard baby, but now I'm cool
I didn't make it sugar, playin' by the rules
I come up hard baby, but now I'm fine
I'm checkin' trouble sugar, movin' down the line
I come up hard baby, but that's okay
'Cause trouble man, don't get in my way
I come up hard baby, I've been for real
Gonna keep movin', gonna go to town
I come up hard baby, I'm gettin' down
There's only three things that for sure
Taxes, death and trouble
This I know baby, this I know sugar
Girl Ain't gon let it sweat me babe
Got me singin', yeah, yeah, ooh
Come up hard, baby, I had to fight
Took care my business with all my might
I come up hard, come up hard, I had to win
Then start all over and win again
I come up hard but that's okay
'Cause trouble man don't get in my way, hey, hey
I know some places and I seen some faces
I got my connections, they take my directions
What people say, that's okay, they don't bother me, no
I'm ready to make it, don't care 'bout the weather
Don't care 'bout no trouble, got myself together
Laughin', no cryin', my protection's all around me
I come up hard, baby, I've been for real, baby
With the trouble mind, movin', goin' tight
I come up hard, come on, get down
There's only three things for sure
Taxes, death and trouble, oh
This I know, baby, this I've known, baby
Hey now, let it sweat, baby, ooh
All right, baby, ooh
I've come up hard, but now I'm cool
I didn't make it, baby, playin' by the rules
I've come up hard, baby, but now I'm fine
I'm checkin' trouble, sugar, hey, movin' down the line, oh
