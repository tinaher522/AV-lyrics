<song artist="Marvin_Gaye" title="You_Can_Leave,_But_It's_Going_To_Cost_You">
I remember like it was yesterday
We were over Gwen's 
And we was trying one more time to make amends
Oh yes we was
Suddenly it occured to me it did not matter
Whether I was mad at her
Or she was mad at me
Naw, babe 
Understanding my condition 
I must surely be a-wishing 
and a hoping too be free
Some said, you can leave, but it's going to cost you
She said, you can leave, but it's going to cost you
Yeah, she said, you can leave, but it's gonna cost you dearly, oh
You can leave, but it's going to cost you, hah, dearly
Sometimes your eyes was red as fire
Intoxicated
Sometimes your spirit was moving on me
Begun to fight me
I had to fight to defend my life
I didn't mind it, you see I find it
a bit a stimulating
That after fighting
We're making love
Ooh baby, ooh baby, ooh baby
Cause after all, you was my wife
Hey, you can leave, but it's going to cost you 
(do you still boogie?  boogie down the road sometimes?)
She said, you can leave, but it's going to cost you
She would try to put me down, she used to bully
She said, you can leave, but it's going to cost you
(I used to sing this song and dance around)
She said, you can leave, but it's going to cost you
{Mr. man, what's going down)
That young girl is going to cost you
If you want happiness, you got to pay
Oooh baby, used to be the apple of my eye
How come you love me baby?
How come you love me baby?
You used to be my heart's desire
My heart's desire, yeah
I'm gone, get used to it, baby
I'm gone, get used to it, baby
I'm gone, get used to it, baby
I'm gone, get used to it, baby
I'm gone, get used to it, baby
I'm gone, get used to it
I'm gone, get used to it, baby
I'm gone, get used to it
You tried to have them shackle me, bring me in - tell me what for?
So to satisfy you baby, you have won the battle - 
Oh but Daddy's gonna win the war
Lawyers worked so hard
Tryin'a take my riches
Rich things, too
Trying to sell my home, tryin to take my life, and my child too, you don't care
Tryin to upset my woman, examinin my soul!  But I was strong, baby
Stood my ground and prayed, asked the Lord to help - 
Wish he was in a position to upset the judge
You can leave, but it's going to cost you
You can leave, but it's going to cost you
You can leave, but it's going to cost you
You can leave, but it's going to cost you
You use to say that I was a gorgeous hunk of man
That didn't help me baby
Ah, when you was on the stand
You can't have happiness until you break me, and make me happy too baby
You can leave but it's going to cost you
You can't have peace of mind, until I get mine
You can leave but it's going to cost you, Marvin
You can't have no jewelry - think about them first.
You can leave, but it's going to cost you Marvin.
