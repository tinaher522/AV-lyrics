<song artist="Marvin_Gaye" title="The_World_Is_Rated_X">
Oo the world's situation should be rated X, oh rated X
Said the world's situation should be rated X, yeah rated X
Listen people 
Not only in the movie show
Take a look outside it's where the truth is really told
It's life in living color
Fighting, killing and dope dealing
It's everywhere
What about the crime, Rated X
What about the killing, fighting, stealing everywhere
They let the children see life destroyed
But they won't let them see its making
What happened to God's creation
The one thing that really bothers me the most
Is how we commentate the lives of other folk
The world today is in a grave situation
Dirty water we can't drink, dirty air, it's so unfair
Na na na... Oh I know something is missing all over the world
Woo, rated X 
I know something is missing all over the world
The world's situation should be rated X, rated X
Oh the world's situation should be rated X, oh rated X
What about the crime, Rated X
What about the air,  Rated X
What about the killing, fighting, stealing everywhere
Then the children see life destroyed
But they don't let them see its making
What happened to God's creation
Where's the love, where's the peace
Where's the joy, where's the hope for us all
Love is kneelin', rated X
Hate is overweight, rated X
The world's situation should be rated X, oh lord rated X
Do you hear me
