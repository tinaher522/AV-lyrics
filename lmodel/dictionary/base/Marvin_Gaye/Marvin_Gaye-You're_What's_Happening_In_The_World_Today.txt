<song artist="Marvin_Gaye" title="You're_What's_Happening_In_The_World_Today">
baby,
oh now, now honey
every time I see you
I'm spinning like a top
intoxicating lady
what you doing, don't you stop
every time you pass me by
I see heaven in your eyes
all at once I'm hypnotized
by your sweet and charming smile
oh
you're what is happening in the world today
oh
in my sleep I see you darling
and you're lovely as a queen
intoxicating lady
you've been joy to my dreams
every time you pass me by
I see heaven in your eyes
all at once I'm hypnotized
by your sweet and charming smile
oh
you're what is happening in the world today
oh
your life is drinking something
it's much to much
and I bet that kissing you
is through and through and true
well I don't know for sure
but I think you'd like a true cause
oh little baby you're what is happening in the world today
I said
you should be in movies
or in a fashion magazines
any king would be so proud
just to have for a queen
believe my lady, that's what you are
you are sure enough a star
you shall receive an award 
for the part you played in my heart
oh little baby
you're what is happening in the world today
oh
you're what is happening 
oh
you're what is happening 
i know
you're what is happening 
tell my mamma
you're what is happening 
tell father
you're what is happening 
dad
you're what is happening 
dad
oh honey
you're what is happening 
baby...
