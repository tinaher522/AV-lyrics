<song artist="Marvin_Gaye" title="I'm_Yours,_You're_Mine">
I'm yours(I'm yours) and you're mine(you're mine)
You are mine(you're mine), baby Im yours(I'm yours)
And nothing's gonna ever, ever, ever
Ever come between us
I'm yours(I'm yours) you are mine(you're mine)
You are mine, and I'm yours(I'm yours)
And nothing's gonna ever, no no baby
Ever come between us
Aah, so glad I found you, oh let me to put my arms around you
Wherever you are near, oh there's a heaven on earth right here, right here
I'm yours(I'm yours) and you're mine(you're mine)
You are mine, and I'm yours(I'm yours)
And nothing's gonna ever, no no baby
Ever come between us
Hey baby, I'm so glad I found you, oh let me to put my arms all around you
Wherever you are near, I say a heaven's on earth (is) right here
I'm yours(I'm yours) and you're mine(you're mine)
Oh baby, and I'm yours(I'm yours)
And nothing's gonna ever, no baby
I ever come between us
Say I love you, no nothing will ever come between us
Say nothing, no baby, between us
All because I'm yours ...
