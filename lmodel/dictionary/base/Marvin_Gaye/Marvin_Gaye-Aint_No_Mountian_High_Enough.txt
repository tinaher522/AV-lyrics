<song artist="Marvin_Gaye" title="Aint_No_Mountian_High_Enough">
Ohh, ain't no mountain high
Ain't no valley low
Ain't no river wide enough, baby
If you need me, call me no matter where you are
No matter how far
Just call my name I'll be there in a hurry
You don't have to worry
'Cause baby, there ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough
To keep me from getting to you
Remember the day I set you free
I told you you could always count on me darlin'
From that day on I made a vow
I'll be there when you want me some way, some how
'Cause baby, there ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough
To keep me from getting to you
No wind
(No wind)
No rain
(No rain)
Ohh, ooh, ooh, ooh
My love is alive way down in my heart
Although we are miles apart
If you ever need a helping hand
I'll be there on the double just as fast as I can
Don't you know that
Ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough
To keep me from you
Ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough
To keep me from you
Don't you know that
There ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough
To keep me from gettin' to you, babe
