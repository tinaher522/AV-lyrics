<song artist="Marvin_Gaye" title="You_Sexy_Thing">
I believe in miracles
Where you from you sexy thing?
I believe in miracles
Since you came along you sexy thing
Where did you come from, baby?
How did you know I needed you?
How did you know I needed you so badly?
How did you know I'd give my heart gladly?
Yesterday, I was one of the lonely people
Now you're laying close to me making love to me
I believe in miracles
Where you from you sexy thing
I believe in miracles
Since you came along you sexy thing
Where did you come from, angel?
How did you know I'd be the one?
Did you know you're everything I've prayed for?
Did you know every night and day
For everyday you give me love and satisfaction
Now you're laying next to me giving it to me
I believe in miracles
Where you from you sexy thing, you sexy thing, you
I believe in miracles
Since you came along you sexy thing
Oh, kiss me, you sexy thing
Touch me baby, you sexy thing
I love the way you touch me, darling
You sexy thing
Ooh, you sexy thing
Yesterday, I was one of the lonely people
Now you're laying close to me
Giving it to me
I believe in miracles
Where you from you sexy thing, sexy thing, you
I believe in miracles
Since you came along you sexy thing
Ooh, touch me
Kiss me, darling
I love the way you hug, baby
