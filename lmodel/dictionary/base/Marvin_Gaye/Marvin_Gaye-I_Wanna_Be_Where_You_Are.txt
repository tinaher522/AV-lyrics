<song artist="Marvin_Gaye" title="I_Wanna_Be_Where_You_Are">
Can it be I stayed away too long
Did I leave your mind when I was gone
It's not my thing trying to get back
But this time let me tell you where I'm at
You don't have to worry 'cause I'm coming
Back to where I should have always stayed
And know I've learned the meaning to your story
And it's enough love for me to stay at
I wanna be where you are
Anywhere you are
I wanna be where you are
Ev'rywhere you are
Please don't close the door to our future
There's so many things we haven't tried
I will love you better than I used to
And give you all the love I have inside
I wanna be
I wanna be
I wanna be
I wanna be
