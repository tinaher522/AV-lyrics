<song artist="Marvin_Gaye" title="The_Shadow_Of_Your_Smile">
You're so sweet and Warm,
Like the summer sun,
From far away my dear,
I can see your face so clear
Making me happy,
The world must understand,
The shadow of your smile,
When you, are gone,
Will color all my dreams
And light the dawn
Look into my eyes, and see
All the lovely things, you are, to me (I Love You, I love you)
Our wistful little star
Was far, too high, oh my darling,
When a teardrop kissed your lips,
And so did I, yes lord
Now when I remember spring
All the joy, love can bring,
Oh girl,
I 'll be remembering
The shadow of your smile
