<song artist="Marvin_Gaye" title="You're_A_Special_Part_Of_Me_(Duet_With_Diana_Ross)">
You're a special part of me
Special part of me
That special tear I shed means you're a part of me
Thoughts of you running through my head
Means you're a part of me
Yeah, I'm satisfied to know you're a part of me
What I want to say is
All I want to say is
Is that I love you
'Cause you're that very special part of me
Oh, oh, baby
Every time you look into my eyes
(Yes, baby)
Can't you see what you mean to me
(Talk to me)
And every time you hear me speak your name
(Oh, baby)
Can't you tell what you mean to me
(Ah, mercy)
Oh, can't move the moon
You can't stop the passing time
Anyway by now you can't move this love of mine
Just as simple as the last rerun
What I want to say is
All I want to say is
Is that I love you
'Cause you're that very special part of me
Oh, when the morning comes I wipe the sleep from my eyes
Well, I can't wipe away what I feel inside
Can't find the cure for not having you around
(Sugar)
Oh I've searched far and near
Ah, but the cure just can't be found, no, no, no
That special tear I shed means you're a part of me
Thoughts of you running through my head
Means you're a part of me
I'm satisfied to know that you're a part of me
All I want to say is
What I want to say is
That I love you
'Cause you're that very special, very special
I love you, oh, words cannot explain
That I love you, sugar you're that special thing
I love you every time I shed that special tear
I love you every time I feel that special thing for you
I love you
