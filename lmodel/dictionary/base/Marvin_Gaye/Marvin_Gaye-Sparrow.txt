<song artist="Marvin_Gaye" title="Sparrow">
I used to hear a sparrow singing, baby
Oh, but one day as I went along 
I didn't hear his song
But I know the sparrow should sing
Sing on such a morning in spring 
Oh sparrow, why don't you sing 
Sing to me, Oh sparrow come around
Come around why don't you can around
Sing about melody, oh melody 
About the things you see 
Anything you want to sing about 
Just sing it on out now 
Sing it on out 
Let the world know what life's all about 
Sing little sparrow sing 
Sing little sparrow sing 
Oh sing little sparrow 
Won't you sing for me? 
And for the rest of all my world
They'll appreciate it, I know 
Everytime I'm feeling low I know 
I can always count on you 
Sing little sparrow 
About the troubles you're in 
Places you've been 
You can sing, I know it
Dont you try to pretend 
But sing while you're here 
Sing a song my dear 
Let me hear your song don't you be too cold 
Sing little sparrow sing 
I want you to sing little sparrow sing
I want you to sing little sparrow sing
Oh a pretty bird song
Sing to me let me hear your agony
Did you say May sucking up the lay
Sing to me of peace and love
Sing to me of God above
Sing, sparrow
Oh, sparrow sing
Sing to me about about mans and humanity
And all the injustice you see
Sing, sparrow
Sing little sparrow sing,
Sing about what to give
Sing about how to live
I want you to sing your true sparrow
Oh sparrow sing
Sing to me of jealousy
I've seen what it's all about
Sing it all out
Shout, little Sparrow
Oh sing at me
Sing me a, sing me a song
I wanna know what's wrong
Little bird tell me
Ah, sparrow
Sing, sparrow
Cause I wanna know
You sleep itty bitty pretty bird
Sing to me, before you go
Sing to me, Marvin Gaye
Before you fly away
Never stop singing, Sparrow
Till we hear your song
Song
Sing your song
Sing your song
On and on and on and on and on
On and on and on and on and on
I remember a bird
