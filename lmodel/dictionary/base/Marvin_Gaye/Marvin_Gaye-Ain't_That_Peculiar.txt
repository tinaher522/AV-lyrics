Honey, you do me wrong 
But still I'm crazy about you
Stay away too long 
And I can't do without you
Every chance you get you seem to
Hurt me more and more
But each hurt makes my love 
Stronger than before
I know flowers go from rain 
But how can love grow from pain
Ain't that peculiar? (Ain't that peculiar?)
A peculiarality (Ain't that peculiar?)
Ain't that peculiar, baby (Ain't that peculiar?)
Peculiar as can be (Ain't that peculiar?)
Oh, you tell me lies 
That should be obvious to me
I've been so much in love with you baby 
That I don't wanna see
That things you do and say 
Are designed to make me blue
It's a doggone shame my love for you 
Makes all your lies seem true
If the truth makes love last longer
Why do lies make my love stronger
(Stronger, stronger, stronger, stronger)
Ain't that peculiar, baby (Ain't that peculiar?)
Peculiar as can be (Ain't that peculiar?)
Ain't that peculiar (Ain't that peculiar?)
A peculiarality (Ain't that peculiar?)
Hey, hey
Ah, ah, ah
Hey, hey
Ah, ah, ah
Hey, hey
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
I cried so much just like a child 
That's lost its toy
Maybe baby you think these tears I cry 
Are tears of joy
A child can cry so much 
Until you do everything they say
But unlike a child, my tears don't help me 
To get my way
I know love can last through years
But how can love last through tears
Ain't that peculiar, baby (Ain't that peculiar?)
A peculiarality (Ain't that peculiar?)
Ain't it peculiar, honey (Ain't that peculiar?)
Peculiar as can be (Ain't that peculiar?)
Say I don't understand this, baby (Ain't that peculiar?)
It's so strange sometimes (Ain't that peculiar?)
Ain't it peculiar, darlin' (Ain't that peculiar?)
