<song artist="Marvin_Gaye" title="Soon_I'll_Be_Loving_You_Again">
Dreamed of you this morning,
Then came the dawn and ,
I thought you were here with me,
If you could only see how much I love you,
You'd want to trust me
Oh in my dream I was loving you
Every place that you wanted me to
Since I believe in dreams and fantasies and things
I'd like to make love to you right there baby,
ooo, I got this real strong need to love you everywhere
I won't stop until I find your passion flowing like wine,
Baby, baby please let me do it to you
(Although) I never gave up no head before
but there's always the first you know
So I made up my mind, soon I'll be loving you
That's all I'm interested in, I've made up my mind
Soon I'll be loving you, girl I know what I'm gonna do
I can't wait to touch you
to give you that feelin'
heat you up my dear
so that your mood will be revealing baby,
And soon as I know I've got you willin' baby,
I'm gonna give you some head baby 
I'm gonna knock you right up woman
I'm gonna to give you some head, suga, I know what to do
I want to give you some head ah you big fine woman
Oooh I love to get it, cause I know just what to do with it
Ah I'm gonna give the ultimate love baby the ultimate love baby
Don't you know I can handle you
Soon, soon, soon I'll be loving you, oh Janice
Ah, hah! Yes, you're so fine
Oh how I love you, ahh oow!
