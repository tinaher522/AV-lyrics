<song artist="Marvin_Gaye" title="It's_A_Bitter_Pill_To_Swallow">
Here I stand lonely, just a heartbroken guy
I used to be a laugher, 'till I made my baby cry
And I knew my baby loved me, I was overconfident
So I did her wrong, now she's gone, I don't know which way she went
My baby forgave me so much time and time and time again
Cause when your baby starts to walk away
And tells you no need to follow
And nothing you do, seems to make her stay
It's a bitter pill to have to swallow
But the way the ball bounces, that's the way the cookie crumbles
From the top to the bottom, that's a long way to tumble
Oh when you realize that you're no longer first on your baby's list
And the home you thought you had forever no longer exists
You wake up and you discover what a great fool you have been
Cause when your baby starts to walk away
And tells you no need to follow
And nothing you do, seems to make her stay
It's a bitter pill to have to swallow
Ooh baby, what kind of fool am I?
To know that you love me and yet I made you cry
Baby when I think it over
It's fault that I'm here, gone, but I'd like to do it over
And would deliver my love to you warm
And on and on
Oh darling you forgave me so much time and time and time again
Cause when your baby starts to walk away
And tells you no need to follow
And nothing you do, seems to make her stay
It's a bitter pill to have to swallow
Cause when your baby starts to walk away
And tells you no need to follow
And nothing you do, seems to make her stay
It's a bitter pill to have to swallow
