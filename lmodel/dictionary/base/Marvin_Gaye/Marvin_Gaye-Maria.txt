<song artist="Marvin_Gaye" title="Maria">
Maria!
The most beautiful sound  I ever heard
Maria! Maria Maria Maria
All the beautiful sounds of the world in a single word
Maria, Maria Maria Maria Maria Maria
Maria! 
I just met a girl named Maria
And suddenly that name will never be the same to me
Maria!
I've just kissed a girl named Maria!
And suddenly I've found how wonderful a sound can be!
Maria!
Say it loud and there's music playing
Say it soft, and it's almost like praying
Maria
I'll never stop saying Maria
Maria Maria Maria Maria
Maria! Maria! Maria
Say it loud and there's music playing
Say it soft, and it's almost like praying
Maria
I'll never stop saying 
Maria
The most beautiful sound I ever heard
Maria
