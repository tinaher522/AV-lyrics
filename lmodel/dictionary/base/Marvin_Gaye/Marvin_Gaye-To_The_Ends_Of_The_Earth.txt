<song artist="Marvin_Gaye" title="To_The_Ends_Of_The_Earth">
To the ends of the earth
I'll follow my star
To the ends of the earth
Just to be where you are
No matter where you roam
I'll never be far behind
Who cares where the path may wind
As long as I find you?
Though the melody dies
The song lingers on
And a thousand goodbyes
Won't convince me you're gone
I'll follow you, my love
You'll never be free
To the ends of the earth
Till you've given your love to me
To the ends of the earth
I'll follow my star
To the ends of the earth
Just to be where you are
No matter where you roam
I'll never be far behind
Who cares where the path may wind
As long as I find you?
Though the melody dies
(Though the melody dies)
The song lingers on
(The song lingers on)
And a thousand goodbyes
(And a thousand goodbyes)
Won't convince me you're gone
(Won't convince me you're gone)
I'll follow you, my love
You'll never be free
To the ends of the earth
Till you've given your love to me
