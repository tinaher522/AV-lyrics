<song artist="Marvin_Gaye" title="All_The_Way_Around">
Do you wanna do it let's it get it on
But how you gonna act this time around
Before I take it off down to the skin
Let's get an understanding
Girl you didn't understand my philosophy
You did not understand
You just ran away from me
Oh, I miss you baby
Ohh I miss you baby, I miss you
You're the best I ever had
You're so bad baby
But I must like you like that
Although you won't let me control this or that
Constantly playing this tit for tat
Ah now I see you're coming straight to the point
You say the more you get baby
Ah, the more you want me
Yeah, darling you're not wasting my time
What I see baby is so hard to find
Although you've been all over town baby
Having your affairs, I still have to accept you back
Angel though you're promiscuous I don't mind a bit
'Cause you're still the greatest lay even when you're miles away
Girl if you run away again
Surely my heart would never mend
Don't tell me the love we made
Was just for old times sake
Staying up waiting for you to come home at night
Was just so hard to take
She said that pain might never mend
So let's be sometime lovers
Oh, baby that's when my poor heart broke up
Well, if you got a girl and you want her for your wife
You got to treat her good and love her all your life
