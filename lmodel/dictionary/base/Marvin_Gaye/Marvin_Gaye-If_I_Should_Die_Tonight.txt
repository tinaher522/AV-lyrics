<song artist="Marvin_Gaye" title="If_I_Should_Die_Tonight">
Oh, If I should die tonight, oh, baby
Though it be far before my time
I won't die blue, sugar, yeah
'Cause I've known you
Ooh, oh, how many eyes
Have seen their dream?
Oh, how many arms
Have felt their dream?
How many hearts, baby
Have felt their world stand still?
Ooh
Millions never
They never, never
And millions never will, baby
They never will
Whoo, If I should die tonight, love
Darlin', far before my, whoa, my time
I won't die blue
'Cause I've known you
Ooh
I'm so grateful, baby, greatful that you're lovin' me
My desire
Is to love you till
I'm no longer here and never tired
Love has been so good to me, me
I'm so thankful
Ooh-ooh, how many eyes
Have seen their dream?
How many arms
Have felt their dream?
How many hearts, oh, darlin'
Have felt their world stand still?
Oh, Lord
Oh, millions never
No, never, never
And millions never will, sugar
They never will
If I should die tonight, ah, baby
I just want you to keep this one thought in mind
That I will never die blue
'Cause I've known you
Ooh
