<song artist="Marvin_Gaye" title="Anna's_Song">
This is anna's song
I'm making love all night long
Take a bath in milk
and lay on your satin sheets
Laughing, smiling 
Lay a while in chocolate mint
Candy sweets 
(living across the way)cross the way 
(living across the way,living across the way)
this is annas song 
(this is anna's song, this is anna's song)
keep on singing (loving my song) 
all night long (loving my song)
oooh work so hard, see me making dollars 
(never worked so hard)
i know i should for my own good, whats it her smile,
makes you so stubborn and oh
didnt you notice the snow, starting to fall 
come let us sit a while, just listen 
to the children laughing and running wild
anna anna anna 
yeah this is anna's song hey baby hey baby 
loving you all night long 
let it happen again and again and again baby anna yeah,
shes a child of the sun, lovingest one of all 
mmm and this is anna's song yeah
keep on loving me baby loving me cross the hall, 
she can't do no wrong 'cos this is anna's song 
laugh and chatter to you, kiss me anna dear
