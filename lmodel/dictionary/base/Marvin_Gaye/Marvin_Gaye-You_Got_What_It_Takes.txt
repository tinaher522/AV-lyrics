<song artist="Marvin_Gaye" title="You_Got_What_It_Takes">
You don't drive a big fast car
And you don't look like a movie star
And on your money, we won't get far
But baby, you got what it takes
(Yeah, yeah)
To satisfy
(Yeah, yeah)
You got what it takes to set my soul on fire
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
And whoa, whoa, yeah
You got what it takes for me
You don't live in a beautiful place
And you don't dress with the best of taste
And nature didn't give you such a beautiful face
But baby, you got what it takes
(Yeah, yeah)
To satisfy
(Yeah, yeah)
You got what it takes to set my soul on fire
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
And whoa, whoa, yeah
You got what it takes for me
And when you're near me, ooh wee
My head goes around and around
And when you kiss me, whoa, yeah
My love comes tumblin' down, you send me
You don't live in a beautiful place
And you don't dress with the best of taste
And nature didn't give you such a beautiful face
But baby, you got what it takes
(Yeah, yeah)
To satisfy
(Yeah, yeah)
You got what it takes to set my soul on fire
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
And whoa, whoa, yeah
You got what it takes for me
And when you're near me, ooh wee
My head goes around and around
And when you kiss me, whoa, yeah
My love comes tumblin' down, you send me
You don't live in a beautiful place
And you don't dress with the best of taste
And nature didn't give you such a beautiful face
But baby, you got what it takes
(Yeah, yeah)
To satisfy
(Yeah, yeah)
You got what it takes to set my soul on fire
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
And whoa, whoa, yeah
You got what it takes for me
Whoa, yeah, you got what it takes for me
Hmm, you got what it takes for me
No need, no, if I close
But you got what it takes for me
Hmm, you got what it takes for me
