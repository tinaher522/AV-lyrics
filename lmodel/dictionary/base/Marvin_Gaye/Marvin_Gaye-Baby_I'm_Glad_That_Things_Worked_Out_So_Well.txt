Baby, I'm glad that things worked out so well
Baby, I'm glad that things worked out so well
Well today I got your letter
And you say you ain't been crying
But I could see the misery
As I read between the lines
The tear stains on your letter
Tell me things ain't got no better
But I'll just make you think I think
That everything is fine, and I'll say
Baby, I'm glad that things worked out so well
Though it ain't the truth, and I can tell, I'll say
Baby, I'm glad that things worked out so well
Though it ain't the truth, and I can tell
Sometimes the grass looks greener
On the other side
And he had fancy clothes
And flashy cars in which to ride
But now he's left you stranded
And you don't understand it
You tell me everything's alright
'cause you've got too much pride, and I'll say
Baby, I'm glad that things worked out so well
Though it ain't the truth, and I can tell, I'll say
Baby, I'm glad that things worked out so well
Though it ain't the truth, and I can tell, baby
I told you what was happening
And I begged you not to go
But you said I was jealous
That I just didn't know
I knew that he would hurt you
And pretty soon desert you
But I don't want to be the one to say
"I told you so", and I'll say
Baby, I'm glad that things worked out so well
Though it ain't the truth, and I can tell, I'll say
Baby, I'm glad that things worked out so well
Though it ain't the truth, and I can tell, baby
