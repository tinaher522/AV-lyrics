<song artist="Marvin_Gaye" title="Pledging_My_Love">
Forever, my darling, our love will be true
Always and forever I'll love just you
Just promise me, darling, your love in return
Make this fire in my soul forever burn
Forever, my darling, our love will be true
Always and forever I'll love just you
Just promise me, darling, your love in return
Make this fire in my soul, dear, forever burn
My heart's at your command, dear
To keep love and to hold
Making you happy is my desire
Keeping you is my goal
I'll forever love you
For the rest of my days
Ooh, I'll never part from you
And your loving ways
Ooh, ooh woman
Ooh yeah
Oh baby
My heart's at your command, dear
To keep love and to hold
Making you happy is my desire
Keeping you is my goal
And I'll forever love you
For the rest of my days
I'll never part from you
And your loving ways
No, I'll never part from you
And your loving ways
