<song artist="Marvin_Gaye" title="Lucky_Lucky_Me">
Lady luck shows my love me
Oh, when she blessed me with your loving charms
I've found my place in the sun
With heaven right here in your arms
I feel so lucky, so lucky baby
Oh, lucky to be loved by you
And I wanna thank you, thank you baby
For all the little loving things you do
I got to tell the world about it
I've got to stand right up and shout it
Hey, look at lucky me
Ooh baby, ooh baby
I don't mind stormy weather
The rain no longer makes me blue
And I don't care when my friends all get together
And leave me out of everything they do
It's alright if the sun don't shine
It's impossible to darken my day
Makes no difference if I don't have a dime
I'll be wealthy anyway
Mmm, I'm no good without you
But listen baby, as long as I got you
Hey, look at lucky me, hey, ooh baby
In my life, there's no misfortune
No struggle or strife today
You're my lucky charm, my guiding star
So just smile and chase them blues away
I can't help it baby, you're so wonderful
Oh, how lucky can a-one man be
Oh, your tenderness and sweet caress
And it all belongs to me
I wanna tell the world about it
I wanna stand right up and shout it
Hey, look at lucky me
