<song artist="Marvin_Gaye" title="Funny,_Not_Much">
Funny, how I've stopped loving you
I can listen to your name and it doesn't start a flame
Not much, so much my heart wants to cry
Oh, yeah, baby, it's funny, how I've stopped loving you
And it's funny I don't miss all the heaven in your kiss
Your touch, I don't love you, too much
Now that you are standing here, darling, I won't shed a tear
This is just the rain in my eyes
And if I have proved to you that everything I say is true
Please help me believe my own lies
Girl, it's funny, how I've stopped loving you
And it's funny I don't miss all of the heaven in your kiss
Your touch, I don't love you, not too much, baby, not too much
Oh, you went away and left me baby
I don't love you, too much, just with all my heart, dear
