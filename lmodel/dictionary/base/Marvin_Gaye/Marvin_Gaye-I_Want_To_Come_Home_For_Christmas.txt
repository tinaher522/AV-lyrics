<song artist="Marvin_Gaye" title="I_Want_To_Come_Home_For_Christmas">
I'd give anything to see
A little Christmas tree
And to hear, hear the laughter
Of children playing in the snow
To kiss my baby, under the mistletoe.
But I can't promise my eyes this sight
Unless they stop the fight
Cause I'm a prisoner of war
Lying here in my cell,
Hoping my family is well
Wish they wouldn't worry so much about me
Just try to get us home,
In time for the Christmas tree.
Listen, oh yeah, ooo,
I want to see snowflakes fall
I want to see Santa Claus
Ooo, I want to hear jingle bells ring,
Want to hear jingle bells ringing
But I can't promise my eyes this sight
Unless they stop the fight.
Ooo, ooo, ooo
If I can't make it home in time
I know you'll be keeping my spirit bright
By wearing my name and trying to stop this fight
Ah, but I'd give anything to see you the family
And that little Christmas tree.
Ooo, I want to see snowflakes fall
I want to see Santa Claus
Oh, I want to hear jingle bells ringing
Yes, I want to hear jingle bells ringing
Ooo, I want to see snowflakes fall
I want to see Santa Claus
