<song artist="Marvin_Gaye" title="It's_Only_A_Paper_Moon">
It is only a paper moon
Sailing over a cardboard sea
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believe in me
It is only a canvas sky
Hanging over a muslin tree
But it wouldn't be make-believe 
If you believe in me
Without your love
It's a honky-tonk parade
Without your love
It's a melody played 
In a penny arcade
It's a Barnum and Bailey world
Just as phony as it can be
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believe in me
Without your love
It's a honky-tonk parade
Without your love
It's a melody played
In a penny arcade
It's a Barnum and Bailey world
Just as phony as it can be
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believe in me
