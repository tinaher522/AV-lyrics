<song artist="Marvin_Gaye" title="Dark_Side_Of_The_World">
Don't leave me, don't leave me here
On the dark side of the world, oh baby
Don't leave me, don't leave me here
On the dark side of the world
'Cause my days are darker than your nights
Since I lost you, babe, since I lost you, babe
I'm like an ember fading out of sight
One more tear and I know I'll disappear
(Bring back the sunshine that you took away)
Come back baby 'cause I need you and I want you
And I just don't think I'm gonna make it without you, love
Don't leave me, don't leave me here
On the dark side of the world
'Cause such loneliness I've never known
Since I lost you, babe, since I lost you, babe
I'm like a man who once knew splendor
Now all his wealth and riches, they're all gone
(Bring back the sunshine that you took away)
Listen honey, listen to me, if you can't come yourself
Please, don't send nobody else
Bring back the sunshine, baby, that you took away
Now my future lies in back of me
Since I lost you, babe, since I lost you, babe
I walk this lonely road into eternity
Just despair and emptiness everywhere
(Bring back the sunshine that you took away)
Bring it on back, baby, 'cause I need you and I want you
And I just don't think I'm gonna make it without you, love
Don't leave me, don't leave me here
On the dark side of the world
Don't leave me, don't leave me here
On the dark side of the world
Don't leave me, don't leave me here
On the dark side of the world
