<song artist="Marvin_Gaye" title="Keep_Gettin'_It_On">
Yeah, wanna talk, oh yeah
Talk about gettin' it on
Well, early in the morning, sugar
Talk about gettin' it on
Oh, you wanna have some good lovin', oh
And plenty good times, oh yeah
Don't just talk about it, everybody
Start gettin' it on, oh!
Oh, oh! Would you rather make love, children
As opposed to war, like you know you should?
Don't you love to love somebody
Think about it people, make you feel so good, yeah, come on
Oh, don't you want somebody think about you good now
Yeah, you got the good decision, come on, just bring it on out, what you waitin' for?
Oh Jesus, trying to tell the people to come on
And get it on, yes Lord, oooh!
Get it on, people
Let's get it on, morning, morning night time, ow!
Ow! Yeah, come on, oh
Let's get it on, right now
Oh, get - it on, get it on
Get it on! Come on, don't hate me
Oh you won't be so lonesome if
You get it on
Ooh, get it on love somebody good, yeah
Yeah, you know you've got to come on out
And get it on, oh yeah,
Get it on, ow!
