<song artist="Marvin_Gaye" title="Stepping_Closer_To_Your_Heart">
I need you closer
closer to your heart
'cause last night I dreamed
that we were drifting apart
now I beg you
darling please
say you will
set my mind at ease
I wanna be closer
closer to your heart
let me closer 
closer to your kiss
for without it my darling
I couldn't exist
now I beg you
darling please
say you will
set my mind at ease
I wanna be closer
closer to your kiss
oh we... honey yeah
closer
closer
closer
closer
closer to your heart.
closer to your heart.
I wanna be closer
closet to your embrace
that's where I want to be forever
any time and any place
now I beg you
darling please
say you will
set my mind at ease
let me be closer
closer to your heart.
closer to your heart.
just a little bit closer
closer to your heart.
when heading
heading your direction
I'm looking for
love and some affection
let me closer baby
just a little closer
darling let me closer
