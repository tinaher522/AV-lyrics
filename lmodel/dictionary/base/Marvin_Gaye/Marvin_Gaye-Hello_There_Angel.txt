<song artist="Marvin_Gaye" title="Hello_There_Angel">
Right around the corner there is an angel
And all I hope and pray, I'll make her my girl
So, if I have wings of gold, I'll fly to you, my love
Yes, I would
and all my way to you I'll catch a star from above
Straight away I'll fly to cloud number nine
Said my baby was feeling fine
???????, this is more that I say
Hello there, angel, are you feeling fine today?
I happen to be in the neighborhood, thought I'd fly by your way, to say
Angel love, my darling angel, can you come out to play?
Come on angel, please, I love you
Now right around the corner there is an angel
????????????????
Yes, she would! 
The beauty of your love shines trough and trough
And all, all without you
I know my world will come to an end
But I feel you float beside me
With each day, a new dawn begins
Hello there, angel, are you feeling fine today?
I happen to be in the neighborhood, thought I'd fly by your way, to say
Angel love, my darling angel, can you come out to play?
Come on angel, please 
OhÂ ?????????????
Hello angel, yes darling, I want to take you home
