<song artist="Marvin_Gaye" title="Masquerade_Is_Over,_(I'm_Afraid)_The">
Your eyes don't shine like they used, like they used to shine
And the thrill is gone, gone, when your lips meet mine
I'm afraid the masquerade is over, over, over
And so is love, my darling and so is love
Your words don't mean what they used, what they used to mean
They were once inspired, now they're just routine
I'm afraid, oh the masquerade is, it's all over, it's all over
And so is love, and so is love
I guess I'll have to play Pagliacci and get myself a clown's disguise
And learn, learn to laugh like Pagliacci with tears in my eyes
You look, oh baby, you look the same
You're a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot, the same
But my heart says "No, no, no, no, no, you are not the same"
And I'm afraid, I'm afraid the masquerade, oh it's all over, over, oh
And so is love, and so is love, love, love, love
So is love, oh the masquerade is all over
So, so is love
