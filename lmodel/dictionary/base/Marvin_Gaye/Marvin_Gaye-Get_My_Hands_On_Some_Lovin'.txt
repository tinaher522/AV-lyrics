<song artist="Marvin_Gaye" title="Get_My_Hands_On_Some_Lovin'">
Wide it up all round me, pretty girls come at me
I ain't got no problem, I think it's so unfair
Patience it's opportune, that's what I've been told
But I got to get my hand on some lovin'
Before I'm too old, too old, yeah, yeah
I get and I'm probably patient, between my sugar and I
Said I'm gonna rock do one of those patsy demo
You're my surprise, sure I got it all in my soul
Wanna get more cuz I got to get my hand on some lovin
Before I'm too old,much too old, yeah, yeah
I said I need a women, need some lovin'
One love yeah, yeah
I hear that I over valley
Pretty women, pretty women
And I ain't got nobody, think is so unfair
Patience they say it's a virtue that's what I've been told
But I got to get my hand on some lovin'
Before I'm too old, too old, yeah, yeah
Before I'm not too old
Before I'm not too old, yeah
