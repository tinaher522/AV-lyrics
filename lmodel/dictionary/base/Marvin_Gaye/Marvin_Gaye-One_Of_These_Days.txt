<song artist="Marvin_Gaye" title="One_Of_These_Days">
One of these days when my heart gets strong enough
gonna pack my clothes and walk out of the door
and on that day, when I up and leave you
you can beat your life that I wont be back no more
sang-a-song like duh dah duh dah 
duh dah duh dah duh dah duh duh dah duh
I know that I'm just a fool for you
nobody has to tell me the way I am
it's the way I feel that make a difference
you see I love you so much that I don't care how I am
Hey now, what am I supposed to do
Hey now, found out your love was untrue 
Hey now, just have to stay
'cause I don't have enough left to walk away
One of these days when my heart gets strong enough
gonna pack my clothes and walk out of the door
until that day, when I get my self together
I'm gonna stay right here, baby come with me
