c'mon on back
I miss you so
I need your warmth
to keep my heart afloat baby
I miss
I miss your sweet voice
make you understand
I need your loving 
I want you back
I need your loving 
I want you back
I need your sweet, sweet love
I need your loving 
I want you back
and I 
I need your loving 
I want you back
I need your sweet loving
I need your loving
I want you back
I want you back baby
I want you back

I miss your sweet lips next to me
the same feeling
it's almost worse than dieing
I miss the way you used to love me
Can't you understand girl

I need your loving
I want you back
I need your loving
I want you back
I need you love
I need your loving
I want you back
I want you back
I need your loving
I want you back
Ohh

I want you back
Ohhh
