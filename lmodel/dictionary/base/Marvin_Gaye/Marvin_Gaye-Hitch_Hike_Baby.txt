<song artist="Marvin_Gaye" title="Hitch_Hike_Baby">
I'm goin' to Chicago, that's the last place my baby strayed
Hitch hike, hitch hike, hitch hike, baby
I'm packin' up my bags, gonna leave this old town right away
Hitch hike, hitch hike, hitch hike, baby
I've got to find that girl if I have to hitch hike 'round the world
Hitch hike, hitch hike
Chicago City Limits, that's what the sign on the highway read
Hitch hike, hitch hike, hitch hike, baby
I'm gonna keep movin' till I get to that street corner 6th and 3rd
6th and 3rd, hitch hike, baby, hitch hike, yeah
I've got to find that girl if I have to hitch hike 'round the world
Hitch hike, hitch hike, baby
Hitch hike, hitch hike, now hitch-a hike, hitch hike, baby
It's all right, hitch hike, hitch hike chillen, hitch hike chillen
Hitch hike, hitch hike, hitch hike, hitch hike dance
Yeah, hitch hike, hitch hike, hitch hike chillen
Hitch hike, baby, hitch hike chillen
Hitch hike, baby, hitch hike chillen
Hitch hike, baby, hitch hike, baby
I'm goin' to St. Louis but my next stop just might be L.A.
Hitch hike, now what'd I say? L.A.
Got no money in my pocket so I'm gonna have to hitch hike all the way
All the way, yeah, hitch hike, baby
I've got to find that girl if I have to hitch hike 'round the world
Hitch hike, now what'd I say?
Come on, hitch hike, hitch hike, baby
Come, hitch hike chillen, hitch hike chillen
Come on, hitch hike, hitch hike, baby
Come, hitch hike chillen, hitch hike chillen
