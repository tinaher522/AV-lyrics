<song artist="Marvin_Gaye" title="That's_The_Way_Love_Is">
Oh, baby
As the bitter tears fall from your eyes
Oh, a thousand times you ask yourself why
The one guy you loved has departed
Oh, you're left alone and brokenhearted
Ooh, love just comes and it goes
How long it's gonna last, said nobody knows
Uh-huh, that's the way love is, baby
(That's the way love is, sure enough, how it is)
Oh, that's the way love is, sugar
(Ooh, that's the way love is, sure enough, how it is)
Oh, that's how it is
Oh, that's how it is, my little darling
Yeah, now, I know you're walkin' down a lonesome road
And your heart is carryin' a heavy load
I know you feel like you ain't got a friend (Feel like you ain't got a friend)
Oh, and your whole world's cavin' in (Whole world is cavin' in)
Oh, but now it's time to be strong (It's time to be strong)
You've gotta forget him now that's he's gone (Now that he's gone)
And remember, that's the way, love is, honey
(That's the way love is, sure enough, how it is)
Oh, that's the way, love is, baby
(That's the way love is, sure enough, how it is)
Ah, that's how it is
Oh, oh, my little darlin'
Oh, baby, whoo
Oh, listen to me, little darlin'
The road of love gets rough sometimes
Don't let it get the best of you
Said I've been hurt by love so many times (Been hurt so many times)
So I know just what you're goin' through
Oh, you wish that you were never born
You've gotta forget him now that he's gone (Forget him now that he's gone)
Just remember that's the way love is, baby
(That's the way love is, sure enough, how it is)
Oh, that's the way love is, honey
(That's the way love is, sure enough, how it is)
That's how it is
So wipe away your tears
Love is here today and gone tomorrow
(That's the way love is, sure enough, how it is)
I said all of your joys turn to sorrows
(That's the way love is, sure enough, how it is)
