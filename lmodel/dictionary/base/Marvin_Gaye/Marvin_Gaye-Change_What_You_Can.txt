<song artist="Marvin_Gaye" title="Change_What_You_Can">
The girl I love locked out on me
Leaving her love flowing strong
My heart would like to carry on
But she said her feeling for me was gone
I tried to find the words to say to make her stay
But she said she couldn't stand it for another day
So the only thing that's left for me to say
Change what you can
But what you can't leave it alone
Have the sense to know the difference between the two
I know the girl is on her way
Taking the love I need so bad
All the love I guess I never had
So what's the use of sitting around and feeling sad
I must respect the fact that she won't be back my way
'Sause she said she can't stand it for another day
So the only thing that's left for me to say
change what you can
But what you can't leave it alone
Have the sense to know the difference between the two
I sit around a misery
Over a love that belonged to me
Everything I could do to make her stay
But she said she couldn't stand it for another day
So the only thing that's left for me to say
You got to change it baby
