<song artist="Marvin_Gaye" title="My_Last_Chance">
I think this is my last  chance
My last chance
My last chance
My last chance with you
Hey, baby
May I have this dance?
I've been waiting all night 
For the song to be right
Now they've turned down the lights
Hey, darling
May I have this dance?
Oh baby
(?)
My love is real
I think this is my last chance
My last chance
My last chance
My last chance
Hey, baby
Dance with you
And maybe you'll see
What I feel is really real
For you
Hey, baby
May I have this dance?
This is my last chance
To get close to you
If you only knew, 
What I've been going through
Oh, baby
I'm just a shy guy
I'm so nervous
Girl, but I gotta try
Girl, please, take my hand
Dance with me, baby
Please dance real close to me
I think this is my last chance
My last chance
My last chance
My last chance
My last chance
My last chance
(Singing fades out..)
