<song artist="Marvin_Gaye" title="Gonna_Give_Her_All_The_Love_I've_Got">
There's a train leaving here tomorrow, oh ya
And I'll be a free man once again, oh yes I will now
I'm so glad I served my time
I'm gonna meet the girl that I left behind
And when I see her, I'm gonna give her
All the love I've got
Ooh, when I see her, I'm gonna give her
All the love I have got
There were times, there were times
When each day seems like a year, oh yes I did now
But the sweet things she said in her letters
Made the times just disappear, oh yeah
She said, "No one's arms will I let hold me
'Cause in your arms is where I want to be"
So when I see her, I'm gonna give her
All the love I've got
Ooh, when I see her, I'm gonna give her
All the love I've got
Baby, ooh baby, my little daring, I'm coming home
Countless nights I stared out my window
At the moonlight, yes I did now, listen peope
Thinking about the way I used to hold her tight, hmm
I must've been out of my mind to do the wrong I did
And leave her behind
So when I see her, I'm gonna give her
All the love I've got
Woo, when I see her, I'm gonna give her
All the love I've got
When I see her, when I see her, when I see her
