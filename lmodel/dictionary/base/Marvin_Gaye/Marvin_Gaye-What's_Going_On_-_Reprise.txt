<song artist="Marvin_Gaye" title="What's_Going_On_-_Reprise">
Mother, Mother
There's too many of you cryin'
Brother, Brother, Brother
There's far too many of you dyin'
You know we've got to find a way
To bring some lovin' here today
Father, Father
We don't need to escalate
War is not the answer
For only love can conquer hate
You know we've got to find a way
To bring some lovin' here today
Picket lines, picket signs
Don't punish me with brutality
Talk to me, so you can see
What's goin' on, yeah, what's goin' on
Tell me what's goin' on
I'll tell you what's goin' on
Mother, Mother
Everybody thinks we're wrong
Yes, they do, I know we're not
But who are they to judge us?
Simply 'cause our hair is long
You know we've got to find a way
To bring some lovin' here today
Picket lines, picket signs
Don't punish me with brutality
But talk to me, so you can see
What's goin' on
Tell me what's goin' on
