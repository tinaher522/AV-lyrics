<song artist="Marvin_Gaye" title="I_Worry_'Bout_You">
I worry about you
when you are gone I get blue
so darling take care
I worry about you
I'm home every night
wondering if you are alright
I knew when we met
that I'd worry about
you matter to me so much
I don't know
My heart is in your hands
where ever you go
whatever you do
come on home when you are through
you are mine, don't forget
I worry about you
baby I worry
when you are out of my sight
I worry
each and every night
I worry
I can't help myself
