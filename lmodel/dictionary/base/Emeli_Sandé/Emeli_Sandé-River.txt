<song artist="Emeli_SandÃ©" title="River">
If you're looking for the big adventure
And gold is all that's on your mind
If all you wants someone to take your picture
Then I won't waste your time
See maybe I'm too quiet for you
You've probably never noticed me
But if you're too big to follow rivers
How you ever gonna find the sea?
So follow me, I'll be your river, river
I'll do the running for you
Follow me, I'll be your river, river
I'll move the mountains for you
Follow me, I'll be your river, river
I'm here to keep you floating
Follow me, I'll be your river, river
River, river
If all you want are answers to your questions
And you can't seem to find no love for free
If you're looking for the right direction
Then darling look for me
See I can make the load much lighter
I just need you to confide in me
But if you're too proud to follow rivers
How you ever gonna find the sea?
So follow me, I'll be your river, river
I'll do the running for you
Follow me, I'll be your river, river
I'll move the mountains for you
Follow me, I'll be your river, river
I'm here to keep you floating
Follow me, I'll be your river, river
River, river
Wherever you're standing
I will be by your side
Through the good, through the bad
I'll never be hard to find
Said wherever you're standing
I will be by your side
Through the good, through the bad
I'll never be hard to find
So follow me, I'll be your river, river
I'll do the running for you
Follow me, I'll be your river, river
I'll move the mountains for you
Follow me, I'll be your river, river
I'm here to keep you floating
Follow me, I'll be your river, river
River, river
Wherever you're standing
I will be by your side
Through the good, through the bad
I'll never be hard to find
