<song artist="Emeli_SandÃ©" title="Winter_Wonderland">
Sleigh bells ring are you listening
In the lane snow is glistening
A beautiful sight we're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland
Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song as we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland
In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say are you married
We'll say no man
But you can do the job
When you're in town
When it snows, ain't it thrilling
Though your nose gets a chilling
We'll frolic and play the Eskimo way
Walking in a winter wonderland
We'll frolic and play the Eskimo way
Walking in a winter wonderland
