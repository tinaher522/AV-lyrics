<song artist="Emeli_SandÃ©" title="Breaking_The_Law">
When you need to smile
But you can't afford it
Go on point it out
I'm gonna steal it
When the floor is more familiar than the ceiling
I will break in late at night
Shake up how you're feeling
I'll never stop
Breaking the law for you
I'll never stop
Helping to pull you through
Whatever it takes ti get what you need
Ignore the alarm
Ignore the police
I'll never stop
Breaking the law for you
When you're taking steps
But need to go faster
We can speed through streets
So the shadows can't catch ya
When the corridors and all the stairs are making you tired
I will come for you
Set the building on fire
I'll never stop
Breaking the law for you
I'll never stop
Helping to pull you through
Whatever it takes ti get what you need
Ignore the alarm
Ignore the police
I'll never stop
Breaking the law for you
