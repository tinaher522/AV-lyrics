<song artist="Emeli_SandÃ©" title="Tiger">
Drop all the pills Doctor told us to take
They say we're dreaming, but I swear we're awake
Whenever you leave all the colours fade
So I'm here holding on 'cause I'm tired of grey
Are you sticking around?
Are you sticking around?
You build a plane and I'll build a boat
If we drop all the silver I swear we can float
Wasn't born for the money so I spent it quick
Bank says I'm poor but I'm feelin' rich
Are you sticking around?
Are you sticking around?
Hey there, honey
You came along and stopped me running
I'm feeling like me, back on my feet
I'm a tiger again
I'm a tiger again
Tattoos on our arms so everybody can see
If they're messin' with you then they're messin' with me
They think we're crazy, crazy and blind
But if I can see you then the rest I don't mind
If you're sticking around
Are you sticking around?
Wash out the glass and pop the champagne
Whenever I can I celebrate
'Cause it's not everyday you get a feeling so brave
Not everyone gets the chance to be saved
Are you sticking around?
Are you sticking around?
Hey there, honey
You came along and stopped me running
I'm feeling like me, back on my feet
I'm a tiger again
I'm a tiger again
