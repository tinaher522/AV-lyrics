<song artist="Emeli_SandÃ©" title="Clown">
I guess it's funnier from where your standing
'Cause from over here I miss the joke
Clear the way for my crash landing
I've done it again, another number for your notes
I'd be smiling if I wasn't so desperate
I'd be patient if I had the time
I could stop and answer all of your questions
As soon as I find out how I can move from the back of a line
I'll be your clown behind the glass
Go 'head and laugh 'cause it's funny, I would too if I saw me
I'll be your clown on your favorite channel
My life's a circus, circus round in circles, selling out tonight
I'd be less angry if it was my decision
And the money was just rolling in
If I had more than my ambition, I'll have time for please
I'll have time for 'thank you's as soon as I win
I'll be your clown behind the glass
Go 'head and laugh 'cause it's funny, I would too if I saw me
I'll be your clown on your favorite channel
My life's a circus, circus round in circles, selling out tonight
From a distance my choice is simple
From a distance I can entertain
So you can see me, I put make-up on my face
But there's no way you can feel it from so far away, yeah
I'll be your clown behind the glass
Go 'head and laugh 'cause it's funny, I would too if I saw me
I'll be your clown on your favorite channel
My life's a circus, circus round in circles, I'm selling out tonight
