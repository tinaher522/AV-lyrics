<song artist="Emeli_SandÃ©" title="Easier_In_Bed">
I'm feeling like a hole in your head
Like the last thing in the world that you need
Time to go but we hold on instead
Close our eyes and we make believe
It's hard, hard to fake it baby
Hard to endure it baby
This don't feel like love anymore
Hard, hard to take it baby
Hard, hard to face it baby
It's getting harder to ignore
But it's easier in bed
Easier in bed
At night-time we pretend
Cos it's easier in bed
You're feeling like we're failing the test
Our fading dream is breaking your heart
You know the physical is all we've got left
Coz the only time you see me is in the dark
And it's hard, hard to fake it baby
Hard to endure it baby
This don't feel like love anymore
Hard, hard to take it baby
Hard, hard to face it baby
It's getting harder to ignore
But it's easier in bed
Easier in bed
At night-time we pretend
It's easier in bed
It's easier in bed
Easier in bed
At night-time we pretend
It's easier in bed
