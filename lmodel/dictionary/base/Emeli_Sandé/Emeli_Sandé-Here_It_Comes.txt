<song artist="Emeli_SandÃ©" title="Here_It_Comes">
It has has been a thousand years since I have gave up hope in
I've told my heart to know my tears at the bottom of the ocean
I hit the ground, I hate the dirt
When cold turkey on the church
I just keep on running running running running
I camp real good, and laying low
I got the hang of breaking
But today I feel like volcano
Today something is changing
Cant hold it down, it's breaking loose
I could try, but there's no use
I'm running running running running
Here it comes....
Here it comes....
Hold on steady, ladies and gents
Ooh, get ready
Cause here it comes
[beat break]
Hurt my turn, when time on shoot
It came unexpected
I thought praying, I love the douche
Hit me like a nap trip
With you, you're my rusty car
I'm afraid, but there's no point in loving loving loving
Jumping off the window seat
Laying all the cities
I left a note to pay my bills, I wonder if they'll miss me
Cause I don't know when ill return
I waited long but here's my turn, I'm loving loving loving
Here it comes....
Here it comes....
Here it comes....
Here it comes....
Here it comes....
Here it comes....
Hold on steady, ladies and gents
Ooh, get ready
Here it comes
