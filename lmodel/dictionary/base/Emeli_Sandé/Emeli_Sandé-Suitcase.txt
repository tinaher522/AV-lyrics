<song artist="Emeli_SandÃ©" title="Suitcase">
(Verse 1:)
Didn't see it coming
No kind of warning
I can't work out what I've done wrong
His clothes are missing
But his keys are still here
Please somebody tell me whats going on
(Chorus:)
My baby's got a suitcase
He's telling me its too late
But don't nobody, please don't ask me why
'Cause all I did was love him
But I can't stop him walking
My baby's got a suitcase but please don't ask me why
(Verse 2:)
What changed so quickly?
Answer me!
If you must kill me then please, please tell me why
He said "Don't touch me, Get out the way"
Will someone tell me what's going on tonight
(Chorus:)
My baby's got a suitcase
He's telling me its too late
But don't nobody, please don't ask me why
'Cause all I did was love him
But I can't stop him walking
My baby's got a suitcase but please don't ask me why
(Bridge:)
I cant stop my heart leaving through the door
I cant unpack my heart 'cause he won't look at me anymore
(Chorus:)
My baby's got a suitcase
He's telling me its too late
But don't nobody, please don't ask me why
'Cause all I did was love him
But I can't stop him walking
My baby's got a suitcase but please don't ask me why
