<song artist="Emeli_SandÃ©" title="Never_Be_Your_Woman">
Well I guess what they say is true
I could never be the right type of girl for you
I could never be your women
Yo Out every night I'm in the spotlight
With another girl knowing that it's not right
Ain't gonna work Stop trying
Had enough this time Your Not Lying
Tho your feeling the pain but Your not crying
Can't take me I'm on another page
Were the babes wanna take me home
I was out all night Didn't make it home
That's More lying
Pull up in the aston Get out the car
Quick jump the que No hiding
Flash (Flash)
Lettin everybody no I got cash
Shower burp when Dining
8 diamond rings there all shining
Bare designers plus I'm designing
Block everybody out when I'm writing
I'm on a hype ting!
Well I guess what they say is true
I could never be the right type of girl for you
I could never be your women
Leave the country No warning
Club swimming Women swarming
See a new ting Get Talking
Get acquainted Start Walking
That's when I start promising the world
Even tho I got a women at home that's past talking
I don't wanna get past talking
I got a yard but let's go to your crib
Air Freshener
Wild orchid
What would he get? If she caught him
He would get a punch in the face like Norbit
Turn around Ignore him
Look away like you never saw him
To hold me down might be awkward
Sighted with another women in Shoreditch
My house I pay the mortgage
Well I guess what they say is true
I could never be the right type of girl for you
I could never be your women
Well I guess what they say is true
I could never be the right type of girl for you
I could never be your women
