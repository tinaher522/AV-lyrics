<song artist="Emeli_SandÃ©" title="Free">
I don't do yoga, never tried pilates
Not many people want me at their parties
Tryina find my place on place, oh I, oh I, oh I
I drink a little more than recommended
This world ain't exactly what my heart expected
Tryina find my way someway, oh I, oh I, oh I
Yeah, whoa, c'est la vie
Maybe something's wrong with me
But whoa, at least, I am free, I am free
Yeah, whoa, c'est la vie
Maybe something's wrong with me
But whoa, at least, I am free, I am free
If you ask the church then I am no believer
Spend Sundays asleep I'm just another dreamer
Still tryina find my home sweet home, oh I, oh I, oh I
I guess I ain't too good for money either
I got 2 left feet, no I'm no Jackson either
Just tryina find my way someway, oh I, oh I, oh I
Yeah, whoa, c'est la vie
Maybe something's wrong with me
But whoa, at least, I am free, I am free
Yeah, whoa, c'est la vie
Maybe something's wrong with me
But whoa, at least, I am free, I am free
I am free, I am free
I am free, I am free
I am free, I am free
I am free, I am free
I am free, I am free
Still tryina find my home sweet home, sweet home?
I drink a little more than recommended
This world ain't exactly what my heart expected
Yeah, whoa, c'est la vie
Maybe something's wrong with me
But whoa, at least, I am free, I am free
Yeah, whoa, c'est la vie
Maybe something's wrong with me
But whoa, at least, I am free, I am free
Yeah, whoa, c'est la vie
Maybe something's wrong with me
But whoa, at least, I am free, I am free
Yeah, whoa, c'est la vie
Maybe something's wrong with me
But whoa, at least, I am free, I am free
