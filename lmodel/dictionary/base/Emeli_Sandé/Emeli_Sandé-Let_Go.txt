<song artist="Emeli_SandÃ©" title="Let_Go">
[Chorus]
If you can see me, then you're probably a little too close
So you think you could love me, well you gotta be stronger than most
'Cause my ex didn't like it, didn't like it,
No my friends they don't like it, they don't like it
Somebody remind me
When's the right time, when's the right time to let go
Uh, dear who ever the fuck is listening,
Tell me of the pleasures of being a normal citizen
'Cause all these fittins' and Vivians keeping me from fittin' in
Why do I feel safer on stage than in my own living room
My grandma say that if I leave my drink I shouldn't sip again
Ooh this tour has got me feeling tired like I'm itchin'
And uh even though it's physical differences and my siblings
That's why I feel so down even at the top of the Wimbledon
[Chorus]
Uh, dear whoever the fuck is witnessing
Disturbing London independent black businessmen
Based on the work and the effort I'm gonna give this year
Everybody's getting the presents they want for Christmas, yeah
Life is only ninety nine winters
So I'm tryna bond with daddy even though I don't like dinners
Don't be confused by my image, I'm no fuckin' public pin-up
But my heart won't let me say no to a picture
[Chorus]
Uh, dear whoever the fuck is, fuck it,
This is discovery hate it or love it
I'm now officially the property of the public since licensing my album
And signing a deal to be published
But none of these songs are written for me, nor am I a puppet
Journalists come for interviews but don't stay on the subject
Yeah, no, yeah, are we done yet?
Questions you've asked me hundreds, now can you grant me some rest
Because I'm tired of it, I'm living out my dream, and I'm tired from it
If music needed saving, I'd die for it
Music's where my heart is, I'm alive for it
I promise
I'm never liked my heart might break
Here in the dark, yeah, we'll be saved
I don't care, no looking back
I've never been, never been, this far from home
[Chorus]
When's the right time to let go
