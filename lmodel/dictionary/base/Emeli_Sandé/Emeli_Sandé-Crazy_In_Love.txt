Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no, no
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no, no
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no, no
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no, no
I look and stare so deep in your eyes
I touch on you more and more every time
When you leave I'm begging you not to go
Call your name two or three times in a row
Such a funny thing for me to try to explain
How I'm feeling and my pride is the one to blame
'Cause I know I don't understand
Just how your love your doing no-one else can
Got me looking so crazy right now, your love's
Got me looking so crazy right now
Got me looking so crazy right now, your touch
Got me looking so crazy right now
Got me hoping you'll page me right now, your kiss
Got me hoping you'll save me right now
Looking so crazy in love's, got me looking
Got me looking so crazy in love
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no, no
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no, no
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no, no
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no, no
When I talk to my friends so quietly
Who he think he is? look at what you did to me
Tennis shoes, don't even need to buy a new dress
If you ain't there ain't nobody else to impress
That's the way that you know what I thought I knew
It's the beat my heart skips when I'm with you
But I still don't understand
Just how the love your doing no-one else can
Got me looking so crazy right now, your love's
Got me looking so crazy right now
Got me looking so crazy right now, your touch
Got me looking so crazy right now
Got me hoping you'll page me right now, your kiss
Got me hoping you'll save me right now
Looking so crazy in love's, got me looking
Got me looking so crazy in love
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no, no
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no, no
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no, no
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no, no
'Cause your love's got the best of me
And baby you're making a fool of me
You got me sprung and I don't care who sees
'Cause baby you got me, you got me, so crazy baby
Hey!
Got me looking so crazy right now, your love's
Got me looking so crazy right now
Got me looking so crazy right now, your touch
Got me looking so crazy right now
Got me hoping you'll page me right now
Got me hoping you'll save me right now
Looking so crazy in love's,  got me looking
Got me looking so crazy in love
Got me looking so crazy right now, your love's
Got me looking so crazy right now
Got me looking so crazy right now, your touch
Got me looking so crazy right now
Got me hoping you'll page me right now
Got me hoping you'll save me right now
Looking so crazy in love's,  got me looking
Got me looking so crazy in love
