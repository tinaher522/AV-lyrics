<song artist="Emeli_SandÃ©" title="Where_I_Sleep">
There's nowhere that I wouldn't follow,
There's nothing that I won't do for your kiss,
I love you like there's no tomorrow,
Cause nothing ever felt like this.
There's nothing I won't steal or borrow,
I'll travel on a boat or aeroplane,
I'll explore a world of sorrow,
Cause when I find you I know,
I know I'ma be OK.
See the times are changing,
And I'm sure of nothing that I know,
Except this is us, and this is love, and this is where I'm home.
In a world that's breaking, where nothing is for keeps,
Oh this is us, this is love and this is where I sleep,
This is us, this is love and this is where I sleep.
I'm from a generation undecided,
I'm restless and I can't help changing lanes,
But in all the noise and the excitement,
Your love is all that will remain,
I've said all of my goodbyes to ego,
I gambled all I got, there's no plan B,
It's the first time that I've learnt to let go,
It's the only place I feel, only place I feel like me.
See the times are changing,
I'm sure of nothing that I know,
Except this is us and this is love, and this is where I'm home.
In a world that's breaking, where nothing is for keeps,
Oh this is us, this is love and this is where I sleep.
This is us, this is love and this is where I sleep.
