<song artist="Emeli_SandÃ©" title="Maybe">
When we first moved in together
Couldn't keep hands off each other
Now we're lying back to back
And silence in the black
We used to laugh until we cried
You would look at me and smile
Now we hardly say hello
And feelings never show
All the signs seem to say love is lost
I don't want to give up yet because
Maybe you could stay a bit longer
Or I could try a bit harder
We could make it work
But maybe, we should stop pretending
We both know we're hurting
Maybe it's time to go
We broke up last Sunday night
Keep on thinking 'bout the fight
Rest my head against the wall
Your bags are by the door
Then your key turns in the lock
I see you on the stairs and stop
Have you had a change of heart
Can we go back to the start?
But all the signs seem to say love is lost
I don't want to give up yet because
Maybe you could stay a bit longer
Or I could try a bit harder
We could make it work
But maybe, we should stop pretending
We both know we're hurting
Maybe it's time to go
Maybe it's time to go go
Maybe it's time to go go
Maybe it's time to go
But I just don't know
'Cause maybe you could stay a bit longer
Or I could try a bit harder
We could make it work
But maybe, we should stop pretending
We both know we're hurting
Maybe it's time to go
Maybe it's time to go
Maybe it's time to go
Maybe it's time to go
Maybe it's time to go.
