<song artist="Leona_Lewis" title="Intervention">
I Know There Are Times When You Need Your Space 
But I Haven't Seen You In Several Days
Don't Wanna Be The One To Push You Away
But I Need Some Time with You To Say
What About What I Feel
What I Want
What I Need To Be Okay
I ALways Put You First
Now It's Gotten Worse
I Don't Know If I Stand A Chance
So I Demand
If I Don't Have Your Full Attention
Time For An Intervention 
Gunna Have To Make A Change
In What Im Gettin
You Don't Have The Time To Listen
Time For An Intervention
No Need To Wait
You'll Come Home One Day
And I'll Be Missin' 
(Time For An Intervention x2)
I Hope That I Can Be Worth The Stay, Hey
And I Hate To See You Throw It All Away
But I'm Not Gettin Anough This Way
I Know You Have Things You Wanna Say
But This Is 'Bout How I Feel 
What I Want
What I Need To Be Okay
I Always Put You First
Now Its Gotten Worse
I Don't Know If I Stand A Chance
So I Demand
If I Don't Have Your Full Attention
Time For An Intervention 
Gunna Have To Make A Change
In What Im Gettin
You Don't Have The Time To Listen
Time For An Intervention
No Need To Wait
You'll Come Home One Day
And I'll Be Missin' 
(Time For An Intervention x2)
Don't Wanna Try To Make This Work
If I'm Not Concerned With How This Hurts
Don't Want This Ultimatum To Make Us Loose The Trust
Because We Get Through So Much
And If I Don't Have Your Full Attention
Time For An Intervention 
No Need To Wait
You'll come Home One Day
And I'll Be missin' 
So If I Don't Have Your Full Attention
Time For An Intervention 
Gunna Have To Make A Change 
In What I'm Getting 
You Don't Have The Time To Listen
Time For An Intervention
No Need To Wait
You'll Come Home One Day
And I'll Be Missin' 
(Time For An Intervention x2)
