<song artist="Leona_Lewis" title="Let_This_Song_Cry">
Can't believe, stupid me.
That I mistook you for a good heart, strong man, who'd understand
Probably, should've seen that you were nothing like my dreams you bruised me-ooh
And used me
Seven nights gonna get round in circles
Seven days won't feel the same
(chorus)
My tears wont fall anymore, they try to
Gon? let this song cry
I'm gon? let this song cry
My hearts? emptied out on the floor, I give up
Gon? let this song cry
I'm gon? let this song cry
Cry, Cry,Cry,Cry,Cry,Cry,Cry
I'm gon? let this song cry
I'm gon? let this song cry
Try to scream, but my sound is comin? out
It's so silent, sadness, muting madness
My tears dry, as a bone
Although I'm well and all the well emotions 
So, is broken
Every night's gon? get round in circles
Every day , still feels the same
(chorus)
My tears won't fall anymore, they try to
Gon? let this song cry
I'm gon? let this song cry
My heart's emptied out on the floor, I give up
Gon? let this song cry
I'm gon? let this song cry
Cry,Cry,Cry,Cry,Cry,Cry,Cry
I'm gon? let this song cry
I'm gon? let this song cry
Cry,Cry,Cry,Cry,Cry,Cry,Cry
I'm gon? let this song cry
I'm gon? let this song cry
Gon? let the melody wait for me
Gon? find some healing in the harmony(harmony)
Each and every cold, and every word, and every rhyme will be my voice(my voice)
Cause right now I got no choice
(chorus) 
My tears won't fall anymore, they try to
Gon? let this song cry
I'm gon? let this song cry
My heart's emptied out on the floor, I give up
Gon? let this song cry
I'm gon? let this song cry
(chorus)
My tears won't fall anymore, they try to
Gon? let this song cry
I'm gon? let this song cry
My heart's emptied out on the floor, I give up
Gon? let this song cry
I'm gon? let this song cry
Cry,Cry,Cry,Cry,Cry,Cry
I'm gon? let this song cry
I'm gon? let this song cry
Cry,Cry,Cry,Cry,Cry,Cry
I'm gon? let this song cry
I'm gon? let this song cry
Let it cry
I'm gon? let this song cry
Ohh, Ohhh
