<song artist="Leona_Lewis" title="Misses_Glass">
See I try to hide the fact
That I am just a fragile individual
So I give off this facade that I'm so hard
When in fact I'm far from unbreakable
I'm so afraid to talk and express myself
Keepin' all of my feelings bottled inside
Of this empty shell that I call my heart
Cos I can't let love back in again
Oh I wish I'd known love was cold before I fell in
Cos I want head on with it's storm
Like lightning going into sand
Oh it's better to have loved
That not to have loved at all
So I guess I should feel fortunate
But it don't feel that way
Least not in my heart
Cos see love has left me broken
Broken like glass
Broken like glass
Broken like glass
So if you see me you can call me
If you see me you can call me
Misses Glass
Now after all the lying to myself
I'm stuck feeling miserable
When I have forced myself to be somebody else
Making me seem invisible
Cos see I'm a woman like any other woman
And sometimes I get emotional
And it might seem hard to understand
Where I'm coming from
And you might never ever know
Oh I wish I'd known love was cold before I fell in
Cos I want head on with it's storm
Like lightning going into sand
Oh it's better to have loved
That not to have loved at all
So I guess I should feel fortunate
But it don't feel that way
Least not in my heart
Cos see love has left me broken
Broken like glass
Broken like glass
Broken like glass
So if you see me you can call me
If you see me you can call me
Misses Glass (repeat to end)
