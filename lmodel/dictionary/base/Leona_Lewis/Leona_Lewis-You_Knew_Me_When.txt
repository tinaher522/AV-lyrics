<song artist="Leona_Lewis" title="You_Knew_Me_When">
Take a look, look into my eyes
You'll see someone you don't recognize
You'll see someone who looks like me
But I'm not the me I used to be
Found I could fall, but I could get up
And after all, I could hold my head up
I made it out, I made it through
I'm someone now, I'm someone new
But you could say you knew me then
You could say you knew me when
You knew me when I was on the edge
And my confidence was shattered
You knew me when I didn't know my word
Didn't know how much I mattered
You knew me when you thought you could get me down, no
You knew me when, you knew me then
But you don't know me now
You look surprised to see I've changed
But I've turned the key and I've turned the page
Stepped out the dark into the sun
To a whole new me that I've become
I was scared, had so much fear then
Now I'm free, now I'm fearless
Took too much for too long
I'm someone now, I'm someone strong
And you could say you knew me then
You could say you knew me when
You knew me when I was on the edge
And my confidence was shattered
You knew me when I didn't know my word
Didn't know how much I mattered
You knew me when you thought you could get me down, no
You knew me when, you knew me then
But you don't know me now
I'm a little wiser, reaching higher
It's a battle but I'm a fighter
This time there'll be no surrender, no
And you could say you knew me when
You could say you knew me when
You knew me when I was on the edge
And my confidence was shattered
You knew me when I didn't know my word
Didn't know how much I mattered
You knew me when you thought you could get me down, no
You knew me when
You knew me when, you knew me then
But you don't know me now
You knew me then, you knew me when
But you don't know me now
