<song artist="Leona_Lewis" title="Strangers">
We were closer
Then I've ever been before with anyone
If it's over
Don't know how to break the fall
Don't know how to give up
Will I ever know
How to let this end
Will your love keep haunting me?
We can bring it back
To where it began
I tell you what's killing me
Remember when we used to know
How the other felt before it showed
Like we were one the same
Now I don't even see your face
Get over that we had it, got erased
I guess that's just the danger
Cos now we're just like strangers, strangers
Now we're just like strangers, strangers
What happened?
Cos we're going no where now
We're falling out
I keep slipping
On my feet 'till I hit the ground
I can't be the only one
Wishing we could start this over again
I just need to know
When you looked at me
Was it just pretend?
I tell you what's killing me
Remember when we used to know
How the other felt before it showed
Like we were one the same
Now I don't even see your face
Get over that we had it, got erased
I guess that's just the danger
Cos now we're just like strangers, strangers
Now we're just like strangers, strangers
This time don't fall apart from me
Your love is all that I really need
Our worlds don't have to collide
Every time that we try to get closer baby
This time don't fall apart from me
Your love is all that I really need
Our worlds don't have to collide
Every time that we try to get closer
Remember when we used to know
How the other felt before it showed
Like we were one the same
Now I don't even see your face
Get over that we had it, got erased
I guess that's just the danger
Cos now we're just like strangers, strangers
Now we're just like strangers, strangers
