[Lil Crazed:]
Hey Ma... Look check it out. There's alotta people right now, tellin you alotta things about me... aight. and there's alot of it is negative. And you know what? Maybe I had a reason to tell you dat, cause you know I did have a past. And I was not a good man, but ever since I met you I've changed.
I Apologize for everything that I been did. I played alotta games and it was just to tale to quit. I was in da deep, I cheated, had alotta secrets, and I know why they call me the creep, cause I was always creepin, but now I've changed ain't the man no more. Somethin inside me made me close that door.
And that's the past, don't let it affect our future, cause I'm ready to learn more and you can be my tutor. So please if you down to teach, baby girl I'm here to listen cause the games over, shorty I'm thinkin'a quitin.
I made a decision to leave the door behind and I'm ready to move forward. I don't wanna go to war, cause you are mine and no more lie and now I'm commited and I don't mean crimes and I won't hurt'chu. I'm here to be your doctor analist cause, I see you can't stop bleedin love
[Leona Lewis:]
You cut me open and I
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding
I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open
Trying hard not to hear
But they talk so loud
Their piercing sounds fill my ears
Try to fill me with doubt
Yet I know that the goal
Is to keep me from falling
But nothing's greater than the risk that comes with your embrace
And in this world of loneliness
I see your face
Yet everyone around me
Thinks that I'm going crazy, maybe, maybe
But I don't care what they say
I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away
But they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein
That I keep on closing
You cut me open and I
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding
I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open
And it's draining all of me
Oh they find it hard to believe
I'll be wearing these scars
For everyone to see
I don't care what they say
I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away
But they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein
That I keep on closing
You cut me open and I
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding
I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open and I
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding
I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open and I
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
