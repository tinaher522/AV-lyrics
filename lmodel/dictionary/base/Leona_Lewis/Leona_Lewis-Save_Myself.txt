<song artist="Leona_Lewis" title="Save_Myself">
I don't know how
You took my world, and flipped it around
I don't know why
I built you up, to knock me down 'cos
No one, ever made me feel like no one
Until I let you in now I'm done
Now I gotta save myself
Gotta save myself 'cos 
You took, every bit of me that you could
Now I gotta do what I should
Now I gotta save myself 
Save myself from you
You twist and turn
You started a fire, and let me burn
But I realise, life's too short
To live your lies
You got me feeling like
No one, ever made me feel like no one
Until I let you in now I'm done
Now I gotta save myself
Gotta save myself 'cos 
You took, every bit of me that you could
Now I gotta do what I should
Now I gotta save myself 
Save myself from you
Even though I wanted you
Every time I'm with you
Everything inside my head keeps screaming
Find a way to break free 
Time for me to save me
Gotta find a way
Gotta save myself from you
You, you, you
Save myself from you
You, you
Gotta find a way
For all those times you made me feel
Like I was so small
I'm thankful now
You gave me the strength to move on
No one, ever made me feel like no one
Until I let you in now I'm done
Now I gotta save myself
Gotta save myself 'cos 
You took, every bit of me that you could
Now I gotta do what I should
Now I gotta save myself 
Save myself from you
Even though I wanted you
Every time I'm with you
Everything inside my head keeps screaming
Find a way to break free 
Time for me to save me
Gotta find a way
Gotta save myself from you
You, you, you
Save myself from you
You, You
Gotta find a way
