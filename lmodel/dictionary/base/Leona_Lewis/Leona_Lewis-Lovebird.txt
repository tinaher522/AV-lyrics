<song artist="Leona_Lewis" title="Lovebird">
I will lay down next to you
Stay in bed all afternoon
We were birds of a feather
We were always together
And I never will forget
All the little things you said
And that beautiful summer
You used to call me your lovebird
But the time went on
The wind has blown
And I've grown
And I started feeling
And my wings have been broken
And I can't believe that I would ever want to be set free
But I just can't stay
So your lovebird's flying away
Your lovebird's flying away
'Cause my heart's been stuck in a cage
Gotta sing my song so pretty, dum dum diddy
And I miss you every day
But there's nothing left to say
Gotta sing my song so pretty, dum dum diddy
I want the world at my feet
Even if it's bittersweet
I wanna stand on my own and hold my heart in my own hands
'Cause I've begun to see that you and me are different breeds
So I gotta believe in, gotta get back to breathing
And I can't believe that I would ever want to be set free
But I just can't stay
So your lovebird's flying away
Your lovebird's flying away
'Cause my heart's been stuck in a cage
Gotta sing my song so pretty, dum dum diddy
And I miss you every day
But there's nothing left to say
Gotta sing my song so pretty, dum dum diddy
And you'll always be a part of me, you made me who I am
But I gotta say, I'm not afraid to test my wingspan
'Cause they say if you love something let it go, let it go, let it go
Open up again, 'cause your lovebird's flying away
So your lovebird's flying away
Your lovebird's flying away
'Cause my heart's been stuck in a cage
Gotta sing my song so pretty, dum dum diddy
And I miss you every day
'Cause there's nothing left to say
Gotta sing my song so pretty, dum dum diddy
