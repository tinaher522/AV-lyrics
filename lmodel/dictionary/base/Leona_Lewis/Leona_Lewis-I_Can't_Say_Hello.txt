<song artist="Leona_Lewis" title="I_Can't_Say_Hello">
When I see you come my way
I lose all composure
Cause it's you I want but I'm too scared to tell you
Mama tried to raise me right
Saying think before I talk, be careful where you walk
Be careful who you're loving
But when it comes to you I'm nervous
The words don't come out right
All I want to do is hold you , but I can't seem to say
No one's ever had an effect on me like you do
Oh I wish that I could tell you, that I'm feeling you
Just want to say hey what's up with you
I'm free so what you want to do
Let's go chill and we can spend some time alone
But I can't even say hello
I can't let you pass me by
I can't even speak I get so shy
Lets go chill and we can spend some time alone
But I can't even say hello
Boy you got me strung on you
I can't get you off my mind
And I'm so confused cause I don't want to lose you
From not having the words to say
Can we go out some time?
Because I think that you're fine
And I want to make you mine
I just want to tell you boy, tell you how I really feel, i feel inside
But it never comes out right
I just lose the words to say
The words to say how much I really feel inside
But it never comes out right
Just want to say hey what's up with you
I'm free so what you want to do
Let's go chill and we can spend some time alone
But I can't even say hello
I can't let you pass me by
I can't even speak I get so shy
Lets go chill and we can spend some time alone
But I can't even say hello
