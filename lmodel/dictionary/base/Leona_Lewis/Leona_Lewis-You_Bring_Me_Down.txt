<song artist="Leona_Lewis" title="You_Bring_Me_Down">
You let me down, cant fix you now
Thought i could count on you to be around
You bring me down, down, down way down
What is the problem
Are you taking me seriously
Is it a joke to you
Or maybe im a fool
Why am i trying
So hard to be the girl that you need
How is this fair to me
When you break through
This is to much
Dont call it love
You are the reason its so hard to trust
Boy this aint what i wanted
And now its got to stop
You let me down, cant fix you now 
Thought i could count on you to be around
You bring me down, down, down way down
No more tears 
Why did i let you have so much control
I gave my arm to you
And you pushed me away
Why are you here oh
Dont you see im letting you go
The damage is done baby
I have nothing to say
Its gone to far
Dont know who you are
I think its better that we are apart
Babe i know where i am 
And i know where your near
You let me down, cant fix you now 
Thought i could count on you to be around
You bring me down, down, down way down
You let me down, thought i had had found 
Some one to catch me when i hit the ground
You bring me down, down, down way down (ooooh)
Would you like it if
I did the same thing to
You and i lasted
Walking years on ma shoes
Boy theres no excuse
Cause of what you did theres no me and you
Would you like it if
I did the same thing
You wouldnt of liked
Walking in time
Boy theres no excuse
Thats who you are and im so over you 
You let me down, cant fix you now 
Thought i could count on you to be around
You bring me down, down, down way down
You let me down,thought i had had found 
Some one to catch me when i hit the ground
You bring me down, down, down way down 
Down
Down
Stop bringing me, stop bringing me 
Down down
Oooh
