<song artist="Leona_Lewis" title="The_Best_You_Never_Had">
I was so in love with you 
There was nothing I could do 
Wouldn't give me the time of day 
Now you wanna be with me
You say you wanna be with me 
You said I was the best 
Gave your love out to the rest 
There was nothing I could say 
But now it's goin' good for me 
You say you wanna be with me now 
And you're telling me that I am where it's at 
But I ain't having none of that 
Because I told you you'd live to regret it 
And now I don't wanna make you feel bad 
But when it comes to me just forget it 
I'll be the best you never had 
You put me through so many emotions 
Now baby it's your turn for that 
‘Cause in your empty heart I have left a mark 
The best you never had 
You saw me as a friend 
Baby I don't want revenge 
But if you must know the truth 
What you didn't see in me 
Reflects what you will never be now 
When you're telling me I always was the one 
I feel your desperation 
Because I told you you'd live to regret it 
And now I don't wanna make you feel bad 
But when it comes to me just forget it 
I'll be the best you never had 
You put me through so many emotions 
Now baby it's your turn for that 
‘Cause in your empty heart I have left a mark 
The best you never had
Back rubs, good love, my stuff 
That's what you missed out on 
My touch, so much we could have had 
Baby you miss my kiss, my lips 
The love I had for you 
Our song, so long 
Baby don't it make you sad 
Because I told you you'd live to regret it 
And now I don't wanna make you feel bad 
But when it comes to me just forget it 
I'll be the best you never had 
You put me through so many emotions 
Now baby it's your turn for that 
‘Cause in your empty heart I have left a mark 
The best you never had 
Because I told you you'd live to regret it 
And now I don't wanna make you feel bad 
But when it comes to me just forget it 
I'll be the best you never had 
You put me through so many emotions 
Now baby it's your turn for that 
‘Cause in your empty heart I have left a mark 
The best you never had
Well I will always be the best you never had 
The best you never had
