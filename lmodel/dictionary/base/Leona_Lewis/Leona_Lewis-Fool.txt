<song artist="Leona_Lewis" title="Fool">
Owh,
How did i get to feel this fool
I use to be so smart
Head on my shoulders
My logic falls apart
As your loves goes colder
{and im checking outta your dairies}
Dint wanna look in side your secret box
Going through your emails
All this jelousey makes me feel like
Some kind of fool
I dont wanna be a fool
I use to be in control &amp; cool
Till u played me for a fool
How did i come to this
Lost in this madness
Maybe it was that kiss
You gave the waitress
Is it her that keeps on calling
Evertime i answer there is no1 there
Filled with Suspicion
I waited outside your house
Like some kind of fool
I dont wanna be a fool
I use to be incontrol and cool
Till you played me for a fool
Fool i dont wanna be a fool
You will be looking good
But i had to come first
I gave your black prada suit
To help the homeless
I read all of her letters
So u told her i was just a friend
Next time ill know betta
Dont let a lover take you heart
And turn you in a fool
All this jelousey makes me feel like
Some kind of fool
I dont wanna be a fool
I use to be in control &amp; cool
