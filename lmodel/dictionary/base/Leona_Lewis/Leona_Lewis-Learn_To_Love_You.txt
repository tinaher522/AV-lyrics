<song artist="Leona_Lewis" title="Learn_To_Love_You">
You've been sad 
You've been hiding so long 
Don't be scared 
Just you keep holding on 
I've been there 
Locked myself away 
Cant bare to face another day 
Your broken and ashamed 
But if you search within yourself 
You can 
[Chorus] 
Learn to love you 
And you learn to heal the pain 
Let strength hold you 
Let it shelter you from rain 
Those shadows cast away your pride 
Find the light that shines inside 
Of you 
So alone its so cold where you are 
Close your eyes 
Let the peace warm your heart 
Free your spirit 
Chase away your fears 
And wipe away the lonely tears 
Feel your courage near 
Let it reach into your soul 
And then 
[Chorus] 
Learn to love you 
And you learn to heal the pain 
Let strength hold you 
Let it shelter you from rain 
Those shadows cast away your pride 
Find the light that shines inside 
Of you 
[Bridge] 
I know your hurting 
Your walls are caving in 
But in time you can make it 
I know your troubles 
Your worlds diminishing 
But just listen to the voice within 
And 
[ChorusX2] 
Learn to love you 
And you learn to heal the pain 
Let strength hold you 
Let it shelter you from rain 
Those shadows cast away your pride 
Find the light that shines inside 
Of you..
