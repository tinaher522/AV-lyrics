<song artist="Leona_Lewis" title="The_First_Cut_Is_The_Deepest">
I would have given you all of my heart
But who's someone who's torn it apart
And he's taken just all that I had
But if you want I'll try to love again
Baby, I'll try to love again but I know
The first cut is the deepest
Baby, I know the first cut is the deepest
But when it comes to being lucky he's cursed
When it comes to loving me he's the worst
I still want you by my side, babe
Oh, just to help me dry the tears that I've cried
And I'm sure going to give you a try, babe
And if you want I'll try to love again
My baby, I'll try to love again but I know
The first cut is the deepest
Baby, I know the first cut is the deepest
But when it comes to being lucky he's cursed
When it come to loving me she's the worst
(The first cut is the deepest)
Ohhhh
Baby, I know the first cut is the deepest
Oh, when it come to being lucky he's cursed
When it come to loving me he's worst
Oh, the first cut is the deepest
