<song artist="Leona_Lewis" title="Glassheart">
Baby, I'm staring at a piece of us shattered on the sidewalk,
Tragic, broken like a china doll, burning like a gunshot...
My heart was beating, and so was yours;
We threw each other down on the floor...
My heart is breaking, it's made of glass;
Guess anything that's good never ever lasts...
So baby, if you love me, let me know,
'Cause everything that hurts, you've hurt before...
You're about to tear this love apart,
And break another glassheart....
So baby, if you love me, let me know,
'Cause every time we touch, touch turning cold...
Promise that we'll never fall apart,
And I'll love you with my glassheart...
And I'll love you with my glassheart...
And I'll love you with my glassheart...
Right now, I'm standing in our empty room, staring out the window;
I hear music that we used to make - boy, play me that crescendo...
My heart was beating, and so was yours;
We threw each other down on the floor...
My heart is breaking, it's made of glass;
Guess anything that's good never ever lasts...
So baby, if you love me, let me know,
'Cause everything that hurts, you've hurt before...
You're about to tear this love apart,
And break another glassheart....
So baby, if you love me, let me know,
'Cause every time we touch, touch turning cold...
Promise that we'll never fall apart,
And I'll love you with my glassheart...
And I'll love you with my glassheart...
And I'll love you with my glassheart...
Promise that we'll never fall apart... fall apart,
And I'll love you with my glass heart...
And I'll love you with my glassheart...
So baby, if you love me, let me know,
'Cause everything that hurts, you've hurt before...
You're about to tear this love apart,
And break another glassheart....
So baby, if you love me, let me know,
'Cause every time we touch, touch turning cold...
Promise that we'll never fall apart,
And I'll love you with my glassheart...
And I'll love you with my glassheart...
