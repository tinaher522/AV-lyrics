<song artist="Leona_Lewis" title="Perfect_Stranger">
Met a man just yesterday
Said that he could erase
Any memory that I don't want no more
So I'm going back today
Yes I'm on my way
'Cause I'm sick of thinking about you
Doctor, doctor please are you sure that,
I won't recognize him if we should,
Walk right past each other
I don't wanna know
I don't wanna remember
I just wanna forget ya
Turn you into a perfect stranger
Deleted from my heart forever
Whenever I'm near ya
I want love amnesia
So all you are is a perfect stranger
Deleted from my heart forever
Every contour of your face
Will eventually fade
Along with all the pain you brought me
Every picture in a frame
Will be replaced
By the one who's gonna cure me
I don't wanna remember
I just wanna forget ya
Turn you into a perfect stranger
Deleted from my heart forever
Whenever I'm near ya
I want love amnesia
So all you are is a perfect stranger
Deleted from my heart forever
Parts of you haunt me every night
Just can't move on with your memory alive
But I found a way to escape you, erase you
I don't wanna remember
Doctor, doctor please guarantee
That I won't fall again for the way he
Looks so deep into me
I don't wanna know
I don't wanna remember
I just wanna forget ya
Turn you into a perfect stranger
Deleted from my heart forever
Whenever I'm near ya
I want love amnesia
So all you are is a perfect stranger
Deleted from my heart forever
