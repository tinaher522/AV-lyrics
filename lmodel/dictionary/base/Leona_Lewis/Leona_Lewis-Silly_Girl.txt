<song artist="Leona_Lewis" title="Silly_Girl">
Started on a summer Sunday
Your pink dress on the setting sun
You were going to Grandma's house, I was too scared to come 
My silly girl, I'm beggin you
Tell me all the things that I want to hear
My silly girl, I'm in love with you
I had to run to catch you, 
You always moved so fast 
With your cute little smile and your silly laugh,
God gave me love at last 
My silly girl, I'm beggin you
Tell me all the things that I want to hear
My silly girl, I'm in love with you
They said just stay away
Right now I wish I had
I'm so in love with you, my silly girl 
They made me go away 
Sometimes life just isn't fair, but I'll be back someday
I hope you'll still be there 
My silly girl, I'm beggin you
Tell me all the things that I want to hear
My silly girl, I'm in love with you
When you're just a silly boy like me, you're always so scared 
Now I'm just out of luck, I wonder if you ever cared
My silly girl, I'm beggin you
Don't stop being a silly girl
My silly girl, I'm in love with you
They said just stay away
Right now I wish I had
I'm so in love with you, my silly girl
