<song artist="Leona_Lewis" title="Yesterday">
I just can't believe you're gone 
Still waiting for morning to come 
Wanna see if the sun will rise
Even without you by my side 
When we have so much in store
Tell me what it is I'm reaching for 
When we're through building memories
I'll hold yesterday in my heart 
In my heart 
Chorus 
They can take tomorrow and the plans we made 
They can take the music that we'll never play 
All the broken dreams take everything 
Just take it away 
But they can never have yesterday 
They can take the future that we'll never know 
They can take the places that we said we would go 
All the broken dreams take everything 
Just take it away 
But they can never have yesterday 
You always used to say
I should be thankful for every day 
Heaven knows what the future holds
Or at least how the story goes 
(But I never believed them till now) 
I know I'll see you again I'm sure
No it's not selfish to ask for more 
One more night, one more day 
One more smile on your face
But they can't take yesterday 
Chorus 
I thought our days would last forever 
(But it wasn't our destiny) 
â€˜Cause in my mind we had so much time 
But I was so wrong 
Now I can believe that
I can still find the strength
In the moments we made 
I'm looking back on yesterday 
Chorus 
All the broken dreams take everything 
But they can never have yesterday
