<song artist="Leona_Lewis" title="Bad_Boy">
Bad boy thats your name
But tell me whats your game
You caught me in the club
You know my name you've seen me before
You touched my ass on the dance floor
I turn to hit ya
Then saw it was you
I was like what the.....
You knew what to say and do
Bad boy thats your name
But tell me whats your game
You caught me in the club
You know my name you've seen me before
You touched my ass on the dance floor
Baggy jeans timberland's
I let you go where you want to with your hands
You take me home do me right,you say girl
Lets f**k all night
I stroke your cock,and spunk comes out the end
I lick it up,i love hot spunk
F**k me f**k me
Harder harder
Simon Cowell with a VCR
Records it all,and pulls his f**king trousers up his arse.
Bad bay bad boy bad boy,you're called Roy.
