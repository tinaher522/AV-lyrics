<song artist="Leona_Lewis" title="When_Dreams_Await">
Verse 1:
I found myself,
Waiting at the door step for you,
But you never came,
Then i saw your reflection in my mirror,
But i knew it had to be a dream.
Bridge:
I found a place one summers day,
I knew that every moment was true,
Then i found a familiar face,
And it was yooouuuuuu,
Chorus:
When dreams await,
You find them close,
Sometimes love is just the most,
I needed your affection,
But you never gave,
You know where to find me,
When dreams await.
Verse 1 again x1
Chorus x2
You will love me forever, won't yooooouuuuu?
