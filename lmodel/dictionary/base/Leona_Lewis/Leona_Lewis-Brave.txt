<song artist="Leona_Lewis" title="Brave">
Angels lift you off the ground
I've got shadows weighing me down
Still you believe
You believe in me
I wish I could feel that way
You can trust so easily
I can't give you all of me
Still you're holding on
When you should be gone
I wish I was that brave
You go to fight for love like a soldier
I wanna run away
You're never scared to walk through the fire
I wish I had your faith
I turn away
Knowing my heart could break
I'm so afraid to lay down my armour
I'm not brave
I'm not brave
Keep my guard up constantly
Stop this pain piercing me
But now I don't know how
How to put it down 
I wish I was that brave
You go to fight for love like a soldier
I wanna run away
You're never scared to walk through the fire
I wish I had your faith
I turn away
Knowing my heart could break
I'm so afraid to lay down my armour
I'm not brave
I'm not brave
Oh I'm not, I'm not brave
Still you believe
You believe in me
I wish I was that brave 
You go to fight for love like a soldier
I wanna run away
You're never scared to walk through the fire
I wish I had your faith
I turn away
Knowing my heart could break
I'm so afraid to lay down my armour
I'm not brave
I'm not brave
I'm not brave
I'm not brave
