<song artist="Leona_Lewis" title="Stone_Hearts_&_Hand_Grenades">
You were like the crash of thunder 
Echo'ed through my darkest nights 
You awaken all my senses, 
Made me feel alive 
Even if we try to fight it 
We know that the sparks will fly 
Cause in the end where just two 
People, Destined to collide 

Like stone hearts 
And hand grenades 
You and I, Are not the same 
There is nothing i would change 
Where stone hearts 
And hand grenades 
All my lonely 
You blow it all away 
And when you need me 
I will keep you safe 

After all the dust has settled 
We lift eachother of the ground 
I carry you a million miles 
I'll never let you down (No) 
Theres alot of strength in weakness 
Theres alot of truth in lies 
But in the end where just 
Two people, Destined to collide 

Like stone hearts 
And hand grenades 
You and I, Are not the same 
There is nothing i would change 
Where stone hearts 
And hand grenades 
All my lonely 
You blow it all away 
And when you need me 
I will keep you safe 
All my lonely 
You blow it all away 
(away ,away,away, yeah yeah ) 

Like stone hearts 
And hand grenades 
You and I, Are not the same.. 
There is nothing i would change 
Stone hearts 
And hand grenades 
Stone hearts 
And hand grenades 

All my lonely 
You blow it all away 
When you need me 
I will keep you safe 
All my lonely 
You blow it all away 
When you need me (when you need me) 
I will keep you safe 
(I will you safe) 
All my lonley 
You blow it all away 
When you need me 
I will keep you safe 
All my lonley 
You blow it all away 
When you need me.
