Why Can't You See What Everybody See's?
Who Is The Reflection Staring Back At You?
And Tell Me
Why Can't You Hear When People Speak The Truth
Why Won't You listen
Does It Hurt You?
'Cause Your One Of The ?Life's Lost Souls?
But Don't Get Left Out In The Cold
And Are You Really Sure Of What Your Looking For
You May Never Find What's Right
Until You've Opened Up Your Eyes
I Can't Take Away Your Pain
Your On Your Own Once Again
How Many Times We've Been Here
What Is It That You Fear
I Can't Take Away Your Pain
Your Loss Sure Is Not My Gain
How Many Times We've Been Here
Why Don't You Know What Everybody Knows
Why Do You Lie To Yourself Does It
Make You Feel Bold
So Many Sleepless Nights Where Are Your Days
'Cause I Hear You Crying
You've Lost Your Way
Your One Of The ?Life's Lost Souls?
But Don't Get Left Out In The Cold
And Are You Really Sure Of What Your Looking For
You May Never Find What's Right
Until You've Opened Up Your Eyes
I Can't Take Away Your Pain
Your On Your Own Once Again
How Many Times We've Been Here
What Is It That You Fear
I Can't Take Away Your Pain
Your Loss Sure Is Not My Gain
How Many Times We've Been Here
And I Know That You Wanna Change
But Your Lie Keeps You The Same
How Many Times You've Been Here
What Is It That You Fear
If I Could Wash Away Your Pain
I Would Time And Time Again
How Many Times We've Been Here
How Many Times
Open Up Your Eyes
Say That I, Can't Take Away Your Pain
Your On Your Own Once Again
(How Many Times We've Been Here) How Many Times
What Is It That You Fear
I Can't Take Away Your Pain
Your Loss Sure Is Not My Gain
How Many Times (How Many Times We've Been Here)
What Is It That You Fear
And I Know That You Wanna Change
But Your Lie Keeps You The Same
(How Many Times You've Been Here)
Tell Me (What Is It That You Fear)
If I Could Wash Away Your Pain
I Would
How Many Times We've Been Here
Over And Over Again
