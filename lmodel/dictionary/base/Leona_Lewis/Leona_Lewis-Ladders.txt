<song artist="Leona_Lewis" title="Ladders">
From these ladders that
Your climbing on
Ill build your diamond Dream
From the ashes of the pavements
That wound up to your house
Hail the sun
And all this glory
The radios on
It's playing your favorite song
I wish you hadn't died last night
I cannot bring you back
So can I come along
I cannot bring you back
From these ladders
That you're climbing on
This is ok look down
I'm in the apple orchard
That we found
Back in the fall
Baby your right at night
I'm a wreck without you
Keeping me so warm
I better perform
