<song artist="Leona_Lewis" title="Joy">
I reminisce about the time
When we first met
When we shared the first kiss
Feeling I was connect
Maybe cause you're so fine
May be it's in how you move
When we meet mind to mind
And you out it down right too
Feels so nice it feels so right
Now my skies are so clear
Not a cloud in sight
Feels so nice it feels so right
No words can explain how I feel
It's just another lovely day
Having you all day in my life
Words can't explain how I feel
I'm so into you for real
I'm thinking about you all the time
Even when you're bad you're still mine
I don't care what people may say
I'm going to ride with you
Cause your love
Really brings me so much joy
Really brings me so much joy
Really brings me so much joy
Cause your love
Really brings me so much joy
Really brings me so much joy
Really brings me so much joy
The little things that you do
Like when you show up at my door
Surprise me out of the blue
It makes me want you more and more
Like when we sit on the phone
Talking sweet thing
All night trhoug
And if I'm ever alone
I can always count on you
Feels so nice it feels so right
Now my skies are so clear
Not a cloud in sight
Feels so nice it feels so right
No words can explain how I feel
It's just another lovely day
Having you all day in my life
Words can't explain how I feel
I'm so into you for real
I'm thinking about you all the time
Even when you're bad you're still mine
I don't care what people may say
I'm going to ride with you
Cause your love
Really brings me so much joy
Really brings me so much joy
Really brings me so much joy
Cause your love
Really brings me so much joy
Really brings me so much joy
Really brings me so much joy
I want to feel this way forever
It's just so good when we're together
Cause you're my everything
It's just another lovely day
Having you all day in my life
Words can't explain how I feel
I'm so into you for real
I'm thinking about you all the time
Even when you're bad you're still mine
I don't care what people may say
I'm going to ride with you
Cause your love
Really brings me so much joy
Really brings me so much joy
Really brings me so much joy
Cause your love
Really brings me so much joy
Really brings me so much joy
Really brings me so much joy
