<song artist="Leona_Lewis" title="It's_All_For_You">
Remembering the time I was yours, you were mine
When everything was so right,
With you by my side,
Suddenly seasons changed,
Day by day he slipt away,
Wishing now I realised your sad eyes said goodbye.
Maybe it must be,
I didn't see that you were gonna leave,
I know I let you go,
Now I want you back so I can show.
Chorus repeat 2x
Even though you're love is gone,
Even though it's said and done,
You're still the only one,
It's all for you.
Even though you didnt stay,
And I let you walk away,
You're my one and only babe,
It's all for you.
It hurts to see you with your friends lookin' so happy,
While I'm feeling blue, 
Always thinking about you,
It goes on and on,
You don't know what you got till it's gone,
Well I'm learning, I'll never take love for granted again.
Now I'm not gonna cry,
I'm gonna show you all the reasons why,
you need to be with me,
I want you right back here,

So u can see.
Chorus repeat 2x
Even though you're love is gone,
Even though it's said and done,
You're still the only one,
It's all for you.
Even though you didnt stay,
And I let you walk away,
You're my one and only babe,
It's all for you.
Baby can't you see that I need ya,
I'm calling but I can't seem to reach ya,
Can't we try and start over again,
So maybe we can try again,
And I'll be there till the end.
Chorus repeat 2x
Even though you're love is gone, 
Even though it's said and done, 
You're still the only one,
It's all for you. 
Even though you didnt stay, 
And I let you walk away, 
You're my one and only babe,
It's all for you. 
Repeat 3x
No you didn't stay, how could you walk away,
Now you're love is gone and your the only one.
