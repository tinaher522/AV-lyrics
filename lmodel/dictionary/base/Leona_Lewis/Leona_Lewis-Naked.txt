<song artist="Leona_Lewis" title="Naked">
You could’ve left me on a Friday
Would’ve loved to at least had the weekend
To go under, and to stay under, t-to get better, and to stay better
But you had to pick a Monday
Now I gotta go to work and get through five days
And get through it, if I can do it, no, I can’t do it
There’s a heart breaking chill running through my bones
Got my clothes but I can’t really feel ‘em on
Oh no, whatever I do, I’m naked, I’m naked without you
Can’t go out, can’t go home, can’t go anywhere
Covered up but I’m still watchin’ people stare
Oh no, now what can I do?
I’m naked, I’m naked without you
Try to focus, to go unnoticed
But the harder I try to stay dry it rains
And I can’t do it, no, they see through it, yeah they see through it
There’s a heart breaking chill running through my bones
Got my clothes but I can’t really feel ‘em on
Oh no, whatever I do, I’m naked, I’m naked without you
Can’t go out, can’t go home, can’t go anywhere
Covered up but I’m still watchin’ people stare
Oh no, now what can I do?
I’m naked, I’m naked without you
Inside I’m still hiding, outside I’m just too exposed
But I know that I should let go, but I miss you
There’s a heart breaking chill running through my bones
Got my clothes but I can’t really feel ‘em on
Oh no, whatever I do, I’m naked, I’m naked without you
Can’t go out, can’t go home, can’t go anywhere
Covered up but I’m still watchin’ people stare
Oh no, now what can I do?
I’m naked, I’m naked, I’m naked
Now what can I do?
I’m naked, I’m naked without you
