<song artist="Leona_Lewis" title="Lost_And_Found">
Staring at tears on the pages
Of letters that I never could write
I know love isnt painless but it's worth the risk it's worth the fight
Playing it over and over I wish that I could turn back time
Baby we're wrong but we could be right
Why do we say things we can't take back and why do we miss
What we never had both of us fell to the ground and love was so lost
It couldn't be found what would it take to for who's blame
I'm tired of crying at the sound of your name
Why don't we turn this around love in the ending don't you wanna be lost then found
Lost then found...
Lost then found...
Love in the ending we could be lost then found
Empty glasses and tables
Echo's through these walls
The memories go were we go there like the suitcase that you never lose
If the good lords eye is upon me I swear to make things right
What ever we've lost I know we can find
Why do we say things we can't take back and why do we miss
What we never had both of us fell to the ground and love was so lost
It couldn't be found what would it take to for who's blame
I'm tired of crying at the sound of your name
Why don't we turn this around love in the ending don't you wanna be lost then found
The winds are calling up we can't stop the rain wish that you could take it back but it's to late it's to late...
Why do we say things we can't take back and why do we miss
What we never had both of us fell to the ground and love was so lost
It couldn't be found what would it take to for who's blame
I'm tired of crying at the sound of your name
Why don't we turn this around love in the ending don't you wanna be lost then found
Lost then found...
Lost then found...
Love in the ending we could be lost then found
The winds are calling up we can't stop the rain wish that you could take it back but it's to late it's to late...
We could be lost then found.
