<song artist="Leona_Lewis" title="I_To_You">
Our love had a stench,
Even if you didn't ask,
I would never say a word about it.
Now I stay home with the kids,
Everyday cleaning up where you live,
Even though I'm educated
'Cause you are great, you are big,
And I don't mind giving in, giving in,
For free, for free
You are love, you are sin,
You'll always be everything, everything,
To me, to me
What am I to you?
What am I to you?
Don't tell me, don't kill me now.
What am I to you?
What am I to you?
Just keep me, and I won't make a sound.
Wouldn't tell anyone about your fears,
'Bout your friends, 'bout the life that I miss
'Cause to me you are the greatest.
I would run, I would jump, I would fall,
Just to make sure baby's got it all,
But to them I can't explain it.
You are great, you are big
And I don't mind giving in, giving in
For free, for free.
You are love, you are sin
You'll always be everything, everything
To me, to me.
Oh,
What am I to you?
What am I to you?
Don't tell me, don't kill me now.
What am I to you?
What am I to you?
Just keep me, and I won't make a sound.
What am I to you?
What am I to you?
Just kiss me as you lay me down,
What am I to you?
What am I to you?
Don't tell me, don't kill me now.
Don't kill me now.
