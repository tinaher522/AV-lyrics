<song artist="Leona_Lewis" title="Winter_Wonderland">
Sleighbells ring, are you list'nin?
In the lane snow is glist'nin
A beautiful sight
We're happy tonight
Walkin' in a winter wonderland
Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is the new bird
He sings a love song
As we go along
Walkin' in a winter wonderland
In the meadow we can build a snowman
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say, "are you married?"
We'll say, "no, man!"
But you can do the job when you're in town"
Later on we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid
The plans that we made
Walkin' in a winter wonderland
In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he's a circus clown.
We'll have lots of fun with Mr Snowman (Mr Snowman)
Until the other kids knock 'im down
When it snows (when it snows) ain't it thrillin'? (ain't in thrillin'?)
Tho' your nose (tho' your nose) gets a chillin' (gets a chillin')
We'll frolic and play (We'll frolic and play)
The Eskimo way (The Eskimo way)
Walkin' in a Winter Wonderland (we're walkin')
Walkin' in a Winter Wonderland (we're walkin')
Walkin' in a Winter Wonderland
Walkin' in a Winter Wonderland 
Walkin' in a Winter Wonderland 
Walkin' in a Winter Wonderland 
Walkin' in a Winter Wonderland (we're walkin')
