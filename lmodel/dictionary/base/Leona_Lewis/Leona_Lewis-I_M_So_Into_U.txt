<song artist="Leona_Lewis" title="I_M_So_Into_U">
Boy, there you go
You're telling me that you love me
But boy, you know
That you belong to another girl who loves you
You are so fine, you blow my mind
With the things you do to me
Blind, she's not blind
Things you do for me, but I know
I'm so into you
I don't know what I'm gonna do
Boy, you got me so confused
I don't know what I'm gonna do
Friends ask how could I give myself
To one who belongs to someone else
They just don't know your love's so good
That they would want it for themselves
Anyone can see, so fine, you blow my mind
With the things you do to me
Blind, she's not blind
Things you do for me, oh my God
I'm so into you
I don't know what I'm gonna do
Boy, you got me so confused
I don't know what I'm gonna do
I'm so into you
I don't know what I'm gonna do
Boy, you got me so confused
I don't know what I'm gonna do
You're not, you're not mine
You're not, you're not mine
You're not, you're not mine
You're not
What am I supposed to do?
I'm so into you
I don't know what I'm gonna do
Boy, you got me so confused
I don't know what I'm gonna do
I'm so into you
I don't know what I'm gonna do
Boy, you got me so confused
I don't know what I'm gonna do
I'm so into you
I don't know what I'm gonna do
Boy, you got me so confused
I don't know what I'm gonna do
I'm so into you
Boy, you got me so confused
I don't know what I'm gonna do
I'm so into you
