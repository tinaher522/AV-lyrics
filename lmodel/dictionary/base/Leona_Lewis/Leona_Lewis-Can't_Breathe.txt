<song artist="Leona_Lewis" title="Can't_Breathe">
What am I fighting?
Afraid of losing
It's like I'm not in control
I'm watching myself fall down
Thinking you won't be around
You know you got my heart unlocked
And even if I want to run
I can't go
Go, go
I don't wanna go, go
Got nowhere to go, go
I don't wanna go, go
I can't breathe
Without you I get weak
And I can't breathe
And I can't breathe
And I can't breathe 
Without you near me
And I can't breathe
And I can't live without you I can't 
And I can't breathe
And I can't breathe
And I can't breathe 
Without you near me
And I can't breathe
And I can't live without you I can't
Maybe I make believe
You're not different
But you got me in love
Don't wanna be alone again
I cannot function without you here
My indecisions and all my fears
Get higher higher day by day
Higher higher
But I can't go
Go
I don't wanna go, go
Gotta let it go, go
I don't wanna go, go
I get weak
Without you I can't breathe
And I can't breathe
And I can't breathe
And I can't breathe 
Without you near me
And I can't breathe
And I can't live without you I can't 
And I can't breathe
And I can't breathe
And I can't breathe 
Without you near me
And I can't breathe
And I can't live without you I can't
Oh, It's just not fair that
I'm lost in your warmth
That I just can't breathe
Just can't breathe
I'm coming up, coming up for a breath
Coming up, coming up for a breath
Coming up, coming up for a breath
Coming up, coming up for a breath
And I can't breathe
And I can't breathe
And I can't breathe 
Without you near me
And I can't breathe
And I can't live without you I can't 
And I can't breathe
And I can't breathe
And I can't breathe 
Without you near me
And I can't breathe
And I can't live without you I can't
Oh...
