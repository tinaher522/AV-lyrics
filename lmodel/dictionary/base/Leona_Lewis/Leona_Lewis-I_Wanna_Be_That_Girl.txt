<song artist="Leona_Lewis" title="I_Wanna_Be_That_Girl">
I get this feeling inside whenever I see you
You give me butterflies
And there's nothing I can do The way it feels is just so sweet
Your touch, your kiss it makes me weak
Just let me show you this is true
Give me the chance and I will prove
I really think that you're the one
I want to show you where I'm coming from
I want to be your girl and be the one who's down for you
I'd like to get the chance to show you that
My love is true
I know exactly why I'm falling in love with you
You're so gentle, so special so masculine
It's just like honey to a bee
The way that you have captured me
Just like a taste of ecstasy
You need to know that I believe
You are the one that makes me feel this way
The way you make me feel
Just let me show you this is true
I don't want to be without you And I dont want to live without you
I want to be the one
Let me know boy can I be the one that you want that you need
Let me know boy cos I'm into you and I want you cos I need too
How can it be that you're the one
I want to show you where I'm coming from
I want to be your girl and be the one who's down for you
I'd like to get the chance to show you that
My love is true
