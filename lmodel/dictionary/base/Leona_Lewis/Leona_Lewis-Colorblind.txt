<song artist="Leona_Lewis" title="Colorblind">
I am colorblind;
Coffee-black, and egg-white...
Pull me out from inside;
I am ready, I am ready, I am ready, I am... 
Taffy stuck and tongue-tied,
Stutter-shook, and uptight
Pull me out from inside;
I am ready, I am ready, I am ready, I am fine...
I am covered in skin;
No one gets to come in...
Pull me out from inside;
I am folded, and unfolded, and unfolding...
I am colorblind;
Coffee-black, and egg-white...
Pull me out from inside;
I am ready, I am ready, I am ready, I am fine...
I am fine...
I am fine...
