<song artist="Leona_Lewis" title="Thunder">
First, it was heaven
Everything roses and fine
You and I were golden
Now it's armageddon
And I woke up like a fighter
Putting up a legion
You were rising like a star
Reigning like a king
While I was waiting in the wings
And I won't wait any longer
When you left me down, I got stronger
If you want a bolt of lightning
I'm on the horizon
But I'm coming back with the thunder
Well, I'm coming back with the thunder
Well, I'm coming back with the thunder
Scared that you would missed out
Scared that I would shine without you
So you held me down, down
But this voice was getting loud
And it just wouldn't give in
Cause I was made to sing
And I won't wait any longer
When you left me down, I got stronger
If you want a bolt of lightning
I'm on the horizon
But I'm coming back with the thunder
Well, I'm coming back with the thunder
With an empty heart, I am free again
For some things to start, some have to end
With an empty heart, I am free again
For some things to start, some have to end
But I won't wait any longer
When you left me down, I got stronger
If you want a bolt of lightning
I'm on the horizon
But I'm coming back with the thunder
Well, I'm coming back with the thunder
Well, I'm coming back with the thunder
