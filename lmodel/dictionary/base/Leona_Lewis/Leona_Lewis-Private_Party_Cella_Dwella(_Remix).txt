I've been your girlfriend 
For quite a while 
And now I'm feeling 
That you qualify 
To get my loving 
You waited patiently 
To get with me 
I'll take you 
Round the way 
Cause boy 
It's time to play 
I'll make you 
Want me more 
Give what 
You asking for 
This is a private party 
It just for you and me 
I want to be your hottie 
Fulfil your fantasy 
This is a private party 
It just for you and me 
I want to be your hottie 
Fulfil your fantasy 
Someone like you is 
Hard to find 
And boy I know what's 
Been on your mind 
And now I'm ready 
To take you further 
Ooh tonight 
I'll take you 
Round the way 
Cause boy 
It's time to play 
I'll make you 
Want me more 
I'll give what you 
Asking for 
Just relax, 
Take your time 
And everything will be 
Just fine 
Cause tonight 
I'm yours 
Come explore my world 
This is a private party 
It just for you and me 
I want to be your hottie 
Fulfil your fantasy 
This is a private party 
It just for you and me 
I want to be your hottie 
Fulfil your fantasy
