<song artist="Leona_Lewis" title="Pulse">
Pulse, Pulse, Pulse (3x)
Heart starts spinning and I can't breathe
Been through this so many times
Like I need a release
I'm so sick I'm nervous
There's so many symptoms
I'm shaking, braking, now I'm a victim
Blood starts rushing straight to my head
Got me spinning around and I can't stand
I'm lonely, I'm so weak
I feel you're the only one who can hold me
Who knows me
[Chorus]
I'm looking for a pulse
Feels like I'm growing cold
I'm looking for a heart beat so sweet
Help me breathe
You're a life line, reach me in time
Help me survive ooooh
I'm looking for a pulse
Feels like I'm growing cold
I'm looking for a heart beat so sweet
Help me breathe
You're a life line, reach me in time
Help me survive
I can't find any signs of a pulse
Pulse, Pulse, Pulse ...
Heat starts rising but my temperature falls
Love is the remedy but I can't feel it at all
I'm yawning, I'm hurting , my senses impaired
Can't feel, can't speak I can't see you there
[Chorus]
I'm looking for a pulse
Feels like I'm growing cold
I'm looking for a heart beat so sweet
Help me breathe
You're a life line, reach me in time
Help me survive ooooh
I'm looking for a pulse
Feels like I'm growing cold
I'm looking for a heart beat so sweet
Help me breathe
You're a life line, reach me in time
Help me survive
I can't find any signs of a pulse
O-o-o-oooooh (3x)
I'm only human still surviving
I need help, please someone revive me
[Chorus]
I'm looking for a pulse
Feels like I'm growing cold
I'm looking for a heart beat so sweet
Help me breathe
You're a life line, reach me in time
Help me survive ooooh
I'm looking for a pulse
Feels like I'm growing cold
I'm looking for a heart beat so sweet
Help me breathe
You're a life line, reach me in time
Help me survive
I can't find any signs of a pulse
(o-o-o-oooooh) pulse, pulse (x3)
I can't find any signs of a pulse
