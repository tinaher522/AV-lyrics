<song artist="Leona_Lewis" title="Could_It_Be_Magic">
Spirit move me
Every time I"m near you
Whirling like a cyclone in my mind
Sweet Melissa,
Angel of my life time,
Answer to all answers I can find
Baby I love you Come, come,
Come into my arms
Let me know the wonder of all of you
Baby I want you,
Now, now, now and hold on fast
Could this be the magic at last
Lady take me
High upon a hillside
High up where the stallion meets the sun
I could love you,
Build my world around you,
Never leave you till my life is done
Baby I love you Come, come,
Come into my arms
Let me know the wonder of all of you
And baby I want you,
Now, now, oh now, oh now and hold on fast
Could this be the magic at last
Now could it be magic
Come, come on,come on
Come oh come into my arms
Let me know the wonder of all of you
Baby I want you,
Now, now, oh now,oh now and hold on fast
Could this be the magic at last.
Could it be magic
Come, come on,come on,come,oh come into my arms
Let me know the wonder of all of you
Baby I want you,
Now, now, oh now,oh now and hold on fast
Could this be the magic at last.
Could it be magic
Come, come on,come on,come,oh come into my arms
Let me know the wonder of all of you
Baby I want you,
Now, now, oh now,now oh now and hold on fast
Could this be the magic at last.
