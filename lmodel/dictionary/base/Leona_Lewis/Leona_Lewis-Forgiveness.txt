<song artist="Leona_Lewis" title="Forgiveness">
mmmmm
i don't want to spend another day
pointing fingers while im placing blame
i'm no angel, imperfect myself
coz baby i get lonely here now
and i don't want to put it all on you
i admit i did some painful things it's true
and i'm sorry for them, i'm making amends
for always thinking i was innocent	
starting today
i'm gonna change
don't wanna make the same mistakes
coz i can see a new horizon
the ice around my heart is melting
and the hurt i feel is slowly dying
now i'm no longer crying
the bridge we burnt is being built again
it's leading to a new beginning
and it may never be the way it was
and that's because i'm talking about 
forgiveness forgiveness forgiveness forgiveness
i wish we could take back the things we said
coz what we said is not always what we meant
we lost out heads in the moment
and the words we used them like a weapon
but no one thinks that we will walk away
and we hate being the people we became
i wonder bout that we're better than that
and i still cherish all the things we had
starting today
i'm gonna change
don't wanna make the same mistakes
coz i can see a new horizon

the ice around my heart is melting
and the hurt i feel is slowly dying
now i'm no longer crying
the bridge we burnt is being built again
it's leading to a new beginning
and it may never be the way it was
and that's because i'm talking about
forgiveness forgiveness forgiveness forgiveness
if everybody could forgive and forget
(just forget)
think of all the times that we could spend
being friends
think about all the lives we could change
and all the love we could make
maybe how the world would be a better place
in the end woah
starting today
i hope that we will change
and not make the same mistakes
do you know that 
i can see a new horizon
the ice around my heart is melting
and the hurt i feel is slowly dying
now i'm no no no
the bridge we burnt is being built again
it's leading to a new beginning
and it may never be the way it was
and that's because i'm talking about
forgiveness forgiveness forgiveness forgiveness
forgiveness forgiveness forgiveness forgiveness 
(spoken) if everyone could just forgive
the world would be a much better place
heeee-eey
forgiveness
mmmmm
