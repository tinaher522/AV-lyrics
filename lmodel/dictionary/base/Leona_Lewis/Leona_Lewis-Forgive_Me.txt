Verse 1
Theres a first time for everything
Its definitely one of them nights
I knew when I looked in his eyes
That he was gonna be trouble for me
I never wanted to lie, I knew that my baby would cry
If he knew what we were doing
But if his love don't pass the test
I gotta get it from somewhere else
But im gone an I need my man
Hope he understands forgive me baby
Chorus
Ive gotta take a chance tonight
So im doing me, myself an
I Can't wait no more
Sitting all alone
Man I really hope
Hope you'll forgive me (oh oh)
Hope you'll forgive me (oh oh)
Hope you'll forgive me (oh oh)
I Can't wait no more
Man I really hope
Hope you'll forgive me
Verse 2
Bin along time since i
Did something good for myself
But why should I be put through hell
Well hes doing what he wanna do
Ive finally found somebody else
Who with me makes me wanna feel
Things that ive been missing so long
And his love always passed the test
But it's a shame I had to look somewhere else
Well im gone and I need a man
Forgive me baby
Chorus
Ive gotta take a chance tonight
So im doing me, myself an
I Can't wait no more
Sitting all alone
Man I really hope
Hope you'll forgive me (oh oh)
Hope you'll forgive me (oh oh)
Hope you'll forgive me (oh oh)
I Can't wait no more
Man I really hope
Hope you'll forgive me
Forgive me but I need to be loved too
Forgive me but I cant wait around for you
Forgive me if I found a man who understands
Just what I need
Forgive me but I need to be loved to
Forgive me but I cant wait around for you
Forgive me if I found a man who understands
Forgive me baby
Chorus
Ive gotta take a chance tonight
So im doing me, myself an
I Can't wait no more
Sitting all alone
Man I really hope
Hope you'll forgive me (oh oh)
Hope you'll forgive me (oh oh)
Hope you'll forgive me (oh oh)
I Can't wait no more
Man I really hope
Hope you'll forgive me x2
