<song artist="Leona_Lewis" title="Favourite_Scar">
hat you wanna talk about?
Wanna stay up all night?
Wanna scream and shout, yes.
Ain't nothing to worry about,
I can take it all, that's right,
I'm your number one, don't you get that?
Yeah, we fight every day,
But we love every night.
It don't matter, it don't matter, it don't matter, it don't matter,
It's all good.
Every bird has a scar, the messed up thing that we are,
I'll take it all, you better be ready.
I never felt like this, you shot me through my heart,
The pain never felt so good, boy, you're my favourite scar.
I never felt like this, you shot me through my heart,
All eyes on me in the middle of the street screaming out your name
And it sound like la la-la-la la-la, you shot me through the heart,
La la-la-la la-la, you are my favourite scar.
What you wanna know about?
Won't mean to tell you all of my sins, yeah, you first.
One shot and you got me and this scar everybody sees on me,
Baby, it says that I'm with you.
Yeah, we fight every day,
But we love every night.
It don't matter, it don't matter, it don't matter, it don't matter,
It's all good.
Every bird has a scar, the messed up thing that we are,
I'll take it all, boy, you better turn up your stereo.
I never felt like this, you shot me through my heart,
The pain never felt so good, boy, you're my favourite scar.
I never felt like this, you shot me through my heart,
All eyes on me in the middle of the street screaming out your name
And it sound like la la-la-la la-la, you shot me through the heart,
La la-la-la la-la, you are my favourite scar.
Funny how time flies.
I never felt like this, you shot me through my heart
The pain never felt so good, boy, you're my favourite scar.
I never felt like this, you shot me through my heart,
All eyes on me in the middle of the street screaming out your name
And it sound like la la-la-la la-la, you shot me through the heart,
La la-la-la la-la, you are my favourite scar.
Funny how time flies.
