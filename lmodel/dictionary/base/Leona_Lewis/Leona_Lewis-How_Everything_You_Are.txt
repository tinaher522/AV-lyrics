<song artist="Leona_Lewis" title="How_Everything_You_Are">
If the day should ever come
That the love we found has come
And the dreams we shared have drifted away
Though I know the golden sun
Still shines down on everyone
My cold world would never be the same
So I'll send a prayer
One day you'll see
Someday you'll realize
How everything you are
How everything you are to me
I can't expect you to know
Something that I never show
But the whirling of the world gets in the way
And it's not that I don't care
And it's not that I don't wanna share
But some of these words are just too big to say
So I'll send a prayer
Someday you'll see
One day you'll realize
I'll send a prayer
Someday you'll see
One day you'll realize
How everything you are
How everything you are to me, to me
