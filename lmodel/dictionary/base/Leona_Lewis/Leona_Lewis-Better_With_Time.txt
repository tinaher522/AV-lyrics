<song artist="Leona_Lewis" title="Better_With_Time">
Its been the longest winer without you 
I didnt know where to turn to
See somehow i cant forget you
After all that we've been through
Going coming thought i heard a knock 
Whos there noone 
Thinking that i deserved it 
But i realized that i really didnt know
If you didnt notice boy you mean everything
Quickly im learning to love again
All i know is im gon' be okay
Thought i couldnt live without you
Its gonna hurt when it heals too
It'll all get better in time
Even though i really loved you im gonna smile cuz i deserve too
It'll all get better in time
How could i turn on the t.v 
Without something that'll remind me
Was it all that easy to just put aside your feelings
If im dreaminq dont wanna laugh 
Hurt my feelings cuz thats the path i believe in
And i know that time will heal it 
If you didnt notice boy you mean everythinq
Quickly im learning to love again
All i know is im gon' be okay yeah yeah
Thought i couldnt live without you 
Its gonna hurt when it heals too
Oh yeah it'll all get better in time
Even though i really loved you 
Im gonna smile cuz i deserve too
It'll all get better in time
Well since theres nomore you and me 
It's time i let you go so i can be free 
And live my life how it should be (no no no no no no)
No matter how hard it is i'll be fine without you yes i will 
Thought i couldnt live without you 
Its gonna hurt when it heals too
Oh yeah it'll all get better in time
Even though i really loved you 
Im gonna smile cuz i deserve too
It'll all get better in time
