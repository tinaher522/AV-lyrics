<song artist="Leona_Lewis" title="Stop_The_Clocks">
Sitting on the car, staring at the stars, seaning on your shoulder...
I wanna cry until I laugh and laugh until I cry...
Don't wanna let a single moment of you pass me by;
If only I could freeze the frame, you know that I would stay right here for good...
I, I wanna stop the clocks tonight,
I, I wanna tear the hands right off;
I, I wanna stop the world from turning, and stay right here for good...
I, I hope the sun forgets to rise;
I, I won't ever leave your side...
I, I wanna stop the clocks tonight, and stay right here for good...
I'd rather spend my life motionless with you than dancing with another... ooh, oh...
I wanna cry until I laugh and laugh until I cry...
Don't wanna let a single moment of you pass me by;
If only I could freeze the frame, you know that I would stay right here for good...
I, I wanna stop the clocks tonight,
I, I wanna tear the hands right off;
I, I wanna stop the world from turning, and stay right here for good...
I, I hope the sun forgets to rise;
I, I won't ever leave your side...
I, I wanna stop the clocks tonight, and stay right here for good...
For good...
Stay...
I, I wanna stop the clocks tonight,
I, I wanna tear the hands right off;
I, I wanna stop the world from turning, and stay right here for good...
I, I hope the sun forgets to rise;
I, I won't ever leave your side...
I, I wanna stop the clocks tonight, and stay right here for good...
I, I wanna stop the clocks tonight,
I, I wanna tear the hands right off;
I, I wanna stop the world from turning...
