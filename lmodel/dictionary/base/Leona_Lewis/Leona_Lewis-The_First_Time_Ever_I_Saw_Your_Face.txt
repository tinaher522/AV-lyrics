<song artist="Leona_Lewis" title="The_First_Time_Ever_I_Saw_Your_Face">
The first time ever I saw your face 
I thought the sun rose in your eyes 
And the moon and the stars were the gifts you gave 
To the dark and the empty skies 
And the first time ever I kissed your mouth 
I felt the earth move in my hands 
Like the trembling heart of a captive bird 
That must stay at my command, my love 
And the first time ever I lay with you 
I felt your heart so close to mine 
And I knew our joy would fill the Earth 
And last and last and last 
‘til the end of time, my love 
The first time ever I saw your face, your face 
Your face, your face
