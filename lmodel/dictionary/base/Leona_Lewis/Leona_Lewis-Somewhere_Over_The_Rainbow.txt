<song artist="Leona_Lewis" title="Somewhere_Over_The_Rainbow">
Somewhere over the rainbow way up high
In the land that I heard of once
Once in a lullaby
Well someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Where troubles melt like lemon drops
Away above the chimney tops that's where you'll find me

Somewhere over the rainbow
Skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream
They really do come true
If happy little blue birds fly beyond the rainbow
Why oh why can't I?
