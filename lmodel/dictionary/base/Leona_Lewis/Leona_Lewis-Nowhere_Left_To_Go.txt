(feat. Cassidy)
I took a hiatus came back and became the greatest. But I love you more than the deal that I signed with Clive Davis. Leona your persona I can't stop thinking bout. But your beauty got me suicidal Sean Kingston'd out. I'm bout to leave but I really think I should think it out, before I set her free and take the Abraham Lincoln route. Cause I think that she should be by my side till the day that I die and they bring the hearse and the Lincoln's out.
3 weeks 4 days and the hours keep passing, by like a train with my brain steady asking. Did I do the right thing? Listen to my feelings. Am I on the right page? Or am I mistaken?
I'm caught up in the maze. I've been shopping like a mad woman spending all my money, but I can't get over this. I think I'm about to suffer a relapse.
(Play your position girl)
You already know
(You be tripping girl)
So why don't you let me go?
(Cause I'm real fair)
But you're playing with my love
(Then why you still here?) There's nowhere left to go
(Play your position girl)
You already know
(You be tripping girl)
So why don't you let me go?
(Cause I'm real fair)
But you're playing with my love, 
(Then why you still here?) There's nowhere left to go
