<song artist="Leona_Lewis" title="Shake_You_Up">
Kill me, it takes a lot to kill me;
Flashback, broken bottles in a trash bag...
The rush when you're about to fall, I feel when I remember it all;
I prayed that I would never have to see you again...
But now you're standing just an inch from my face,
And your drop of crazy is all I can taste...
But what you don't know is I came out of the dark;
I know exactly how to shake you, to shake you up...
Now you're standing just an inch from my face,
And your drop of crazy is all I can taste...
But what you don't know is I came out of the dark;
I know how to shake you, to shake you up...
To shake you up...
To shake you up...
Watch it - oh, how good it feels to do this
Like you did - the difference is that you deserve it...
No rush - I got the power tonight, and you are on the losing side,
But I'll never forget how you tore me down...
Now you're standing just an inch from my face,
And your drop of crazy is all I can taste...
But what you don't know is I came out of the dark;
I know exactly how to shake you, to shake you up...
Now you're standing just an inch from my face,
And your drop of crazy is all I can taste...
But what you don't know is I came out of the dark;
I know how to shake you, to shake you up...
To shake you up...
To shake you up...
How does it feel? How does it feel to be the victim?
How does it feel? I know, 'cause you did this to me, oh, yeah, yeah...
(Now you're standing just an inch from my face,) Yeah, yeah...
(And your drop of crazy is all I can taste...) Oh, oh...
(But what you don't know is I came out of the dark;) Dark...
(I know exactly how to shake you, to shake you up...) Oh, yeah...
(Now you're reaching out to take my hand;) Takin' my hand...
(You don't know youâ€™re standing on sinking sand...) On sinking sand...
(I learned from the best, so I know
Exactly how to shake you,) how to shake you up...
I'm gonna shake, (gonna shake,) I'm gonna shake (you up...)
(I'm gonna shake, gonna shake, gonna shake you up...)
(I'm gonna shake, gonna shake, gonna shake you up...) I'm gonna shake you!
I'm gonna shake, (gonna shake, gonna shake you up...) Yeah...
