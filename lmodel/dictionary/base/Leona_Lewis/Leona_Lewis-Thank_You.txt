<song artist="Leona_Lewis" title="Thank_You">
If I've ever put you through hell
Only called when I needed help
If I've only thought of myself
Couldn't find the words to say what I felt
If I've ever lied to your face
Shut you out to keep you away
You'd always give and I'd always take
Yes, it took some time for me to say
Thank you, thank you
For seeing the best and the worst of me
The angel underneath
Thank you
When I had trouble finding my way
You showed me I am not my mistakes, no
And that dreams are meant to be lived, not to be chased
And our hearts get stronger after they break
So thank you, thank you
For seeing the best and the worst of me
The angel underneath
Thank you
Cause I wouldn't be here without you
How could I ever doubt you
Slamming doors didn't stop you
Oh, you made me face up to
I wouldn't be here without you
How could I ever doubt you
I was running wild, a reckless child
I'm sorry if I let you down
If I ever put you through hell
Only called when I needed help
Yes, it took some time for me to see
Thank you, thank you
For seeing the best and the worst of me
The angel underneath
Thank you
Thank you, thank, thank you
Thank you, thank you
