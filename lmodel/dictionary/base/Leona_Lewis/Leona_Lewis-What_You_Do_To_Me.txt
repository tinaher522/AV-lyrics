<song artist="Leona_Lewis" title="What_You_Do_To_Me">
I see the way you look at me trying not to stare,
I'm sitting over here, but your way over there,
Wondering if you got what it takes to make a move,
You know I want you too.
Send a shiver down my spine,
My body's, my body's, ting-ting-tingling,
I love the tide
My body, my body's ting-ting-tingling with fever
Whenever I see you,fever whenever I need ya
I'm getting hot just thinking about you,
This is what you do to me
What you do to me
Fever I cant seam to fight it,
Fever cause I think I like it.
I'm getting hot just thinking about you
This is what you do to me
What you do to me.
Dont wanna make a scene but your look had got me checkin,
Every move you make, every minute, every second,
Dont know if I should tell you, or let it be a secret
But you know I cant give up.
Send a shiver down my spine,
My body's, my body's, ting-ting-tingling,
I love the tide
My body, my body's ting-ting-tingling with fever
Whenever I see you,fever whenever i need ya
I'm getting hot just thinking about you,
This is what you do to me
What you do to me
Fever I cant seam to fight it,
Fever cause I think I like it.
I'm getting hot just thinking about you
This is what you do to me
What you do to me.
Fever
Your givin me fever.
Fever, Whenever I see you,fever whenever I need ya
I'm getting hot just thinking about you,
This is what you do to me,
(chorus in the back round while she sings)
What your doing to me,
What your doing baby,fever
I cant seam to fight it,fever
Oh baby you know that I like,
I'm getting hot, oh baby dont you stop
Oh your giving me a fever baby (7)x
Fever
