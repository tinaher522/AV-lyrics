<song artist="Leona_Lewis" title="Illusion">
My hands are tied in a knot
I've never seen before
My feet are bound to a weight
Headed to the ocean floor
Baby, I ain't crying wolf this time
This situation I can't untie, undo
If there was a trapdoor or a hidden floor
Baby, I would've used it
To get out, to set me free
But I don't know how to do it
Your love's an illusion
I keep on falling for it
I keep on falling for it
Your love's an illusion
I could've swore I saw it
But I keep falling for it
'cause your love is an illusion
You hesitated in a way I've never seen before
Baby, when it comes down to it
I just wanted more
Baby, I ain't crying wolf this time
This relationship I can't untie, undo
If there was a trapdoor or a hidden floor
Baby, I would've used it
To get out, to set me free But I don't know how to do it
Your love's an illusion
I keep on falling for it
I keep on falling for it
Your love's an illusion
I could've swore I saw it
But I keep falling for it
Now you see it, now you don't
Used to feel it, what went wrong?
Now you see it, now you don't
Used to feel it, and now it's gone
If there was a trap door or a hidden floor
Baby, I would've used it
To get out, to set me free
But I don't know how to do it
Your love's an illusion
I keep on falling for it
I keep on falling for it
Your love is an illusion
I could've swore I saw it
But I keep on falling for it
'Cause your love is an illusion
