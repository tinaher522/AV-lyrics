<song artist="Leona_Lewis" title="Love_Is_Your_Color">
Ooooo ooooo....(a buncha mush)
Just when you think it's over
You're hit with a brand new start
And you found out right there within you
That you never lost that spark.
Love is your color...
It makes you shine,
So show your color
It comes from inside.
Some say
But Love is your color,
It makes you shine
Sometimes it's hard to cope
But you'll always know
It's your color
It comes from inside
Everything else is black and white
Love is
Your color
Love is a force that we can't hold back like
Love is a friend
That will hold your hand
Always right there by your side.
Love is a color,
Oh it makes you shine
I know
(I know)
I know
Show your color
It comes from inside
Everything else is black and white.
Oh no no no no
Love is your color
Love is your color
It makes you shine
(It makes you shine)
I know...
I know...
I know...I know I know I know...
It comes from inside
Everything else is black and white.
Oooooooh oooh
Love is your color
Oooooooh oooh
Love is your color
(Love is your color)
Oooooooh oooh
Love is your color
(Love is your color)
Love is your color...
Baby,
Love is your color,
Show your color,
Love is your color.
