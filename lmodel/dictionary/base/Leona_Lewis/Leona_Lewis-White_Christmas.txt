<song artist="Leona_Lewis" title="White_Christmas">
I, I'm dreaming of a white, white Christmas
Just like the one's I used to know
Honey, it's where the treetops glisten and little children, they tried to listen, to hear
Hear for them sleighbells that are ringing in the snow
Oh, white, I'm dreaming of a white, white Christmas
With every Christmas card that I write you
And I want you to know
May your days, may your days, may your days be merry and bright
And may all, all of your Christmases
And may your days, may your days, may your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white
Said I'm dreaming, said I'm dreaming
