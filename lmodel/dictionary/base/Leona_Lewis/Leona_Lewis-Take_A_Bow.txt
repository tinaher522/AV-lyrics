<song artist="Leona_Lewis" title="Take_A_Bow">
The flowers are faded now 
Along with your letters 
They will never 
See the light of day 
‘Cause I'll never take them out 
And there's no turning back 
It's for the better 
Baby I deserve 
More than empty words and promises 
I believed everything you said 
And I gave you the best I had 
Chorus 
So take a bow 
‘Cause you've taken everything else 
You played the part 
And like a star you played it so well 
Take a bow 
‘Cause this scene is coming to an end 
I gave you love 
All you gave me was pretend 
So now 
Take a bow 
The future's about to change 
Before you know it 
The curtain closes 
Take a look around 
There's no one in the crowd 
I'm throwing away the pain 
And you should know that 
Your performance 
It made me stronger now 
Chorus 
Well it must of been sleight of hand 
‘Cause I still can't understand 
How I could never see 
Just what a fool believes 
But the lies they start to show 
Tell me how does it feel to know right now 
That I won't be around 
So baby before I put you out 
Chorus 
Chorus 
So take a bow
