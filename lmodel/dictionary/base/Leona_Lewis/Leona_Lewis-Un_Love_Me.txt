<song artist="Leona_Lewis" title="Un_Love_Me">
Waiting, sitting in the front seat;
Which one of us will be the first one to leave?
Empty, out of words, we're spinning, 
Going in circles - Why won't we let this die?
It doesn't matter, all the times you broke my heart;
When I'm alone, wish you'd be with me in the dark,
But when you're here, you know we always fall apart;
We're better off on our own...
Wish I could tell you goodbye, but I won't,
'Cause every time that I try, can't let go...
I'm begging you to un-love me, un-love me, un-love me,
'Cause I can't un-love you...
Frozen, even though we're broken,
We keep holding on to these distant memories...
And now you know I saw those pictures on your phone,
And you don't even bother ask me where I go
When I don't make it home - now everybody knows
We're better off on our own...
Wish I could tell you goodbye, but I won't,
'Cause every time that I try, can't let go...
I'm begging you to un-love me, un-love me, un-love me,
'Cause I know should wanna be free, but I don't,
'Cause I still wanna believe you're the one...
I'm begging you to un-love me, un-love me, un-love me,
'Cause I can't un-love you...
I can't un-love you... I, I can't un-love you...
I can't un-love you... I, I can't un-love you...
I can't un-love you... I, I can't un-love you...
I can't un-love you... I...
Wish I could say you goodbye,
'Cause every time that I try...
I'm begging you to un-love me (Un-love me...), un-love me (Un-love me...), un-love me (Un-love me...),
'Cause I know should wanna be free, (but I don't,)
'Cause I still wanna believe (you're the one...)
I'm begging you to un-love me, un-love me, un-love me,
'Cause I can't un-love you...
(I can't un-love you... I, I can't un-love you...
I can't un-love you... I, I can't un-love you...)
(I can't un-love you...) Un-love me... (I, I can't un-love you...) Un-love me...
(I can't un-love you...) 'Cause I can't un-love you...
