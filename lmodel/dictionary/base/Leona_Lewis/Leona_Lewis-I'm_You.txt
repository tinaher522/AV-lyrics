<song artist="Leona_Lewis" title="I'm_You">
How many times
Are you gonna take it 
Look in my eyes
Help me make this make sense 
Night after night 
You sat up n cried
Wondering when you're gonna see things clearer
You don't even realise
That at this very moment 
You're talking to yourself in the mirror
It's true 
So you think I'm strong but you're feelin that you're weak
Baby I'm you 
But we're one in the same so you're just as strong as me
Baby I'm you 
And we deserve better its time for us to leave
You know what to do
Cause I'm not a fool
So neither are you
Baby I'm you 
Oh you're not crazy
If only you'd realise 
That you and I
Have all the help we need 
So why are we sitting here on the floor
(listen to me)
We ain't cryin no more
I am your soul 
I am your heart
My strength is yours
Baby its true 
So you think I'm strong but you're feelin that you're weak
Baby I'm you
But we're one in the same so you're just as strong as me 
Baby I'm you 
And we deserve better its time for us to leave
You know what to do
Cause I'm not a fool
So neither are you
Baby I'm you 
So pick yourself up right now
We've been here too long
We've overstayed it enough
That might have been
It's been a long time gone 
So wipe away the tears 
Ain't nothing for us here 
The time has come to move on 
Baby we deserve better 
And we're far too strong
To let this go on 
Baby I'm you

So you think I'm strong but you're feelin that you're weak
Baby I'm you
But we're one in the same so you're just as strong as me 
Baby I'm you 
And we deserve better its time for us to leave
You know what to do
Cause I'm not a fool
So neither are you

Baby I'm you x3
