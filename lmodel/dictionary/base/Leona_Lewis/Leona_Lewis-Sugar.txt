<song artist="Leona_Lewis" title="Sugar">
First time and it tasted like honey...
I'm hooked, yeah, you know you got me;
Here I am, back again...
Close my eyes and it feels like summer...
I know I shouldn't, but I know I'm gonna;
Here we go - kiss me slow....
And I know you're bad, yeah, I know you're no good for me,
I'm aware of that, and the only one that's gon' be
Sleeping at night, and paying the price will be me...
But sugar still tastes like sugar - it's still sweet;
I should never have let it taken over - I'm in too deep...
See, there is no better kind of way to describe it - I know it's bad for me;
But sugar still tastes like sugar - it's still sweet...
My whole world changed from the moment I met you...
Shame on me, my mother told me better;
Here I am, back again...
You call, and you know I'm coming;
I can't leave, even if I wanted...
Here we go - kiss me slow...
And I know you're bad, yeah, I know you're no good for me,
I'm aware of that, and the only one that's gon' be
Sleepless at night, and paying the price will be me...
But sugar still tastes like sugar - it's still sweet;
I should never have let it taken over - I'm in too deep...
See, there is no better kind of way to describe it - I know it's bad for me;
But sugar still tastes like sugar - it's still sweet...
You got me... you got me,
And I don't want to say no, can't leave you alone, can't seem to let go...
You got me... yeah, you got me,
And I don't want to say no, can't leave you alone, can't seem to let go...
But sugar still tastes like sugar - it's still sweet;
I should never have let it taken over - I'm in too deep...
See, there is no better kind of way to describe it - I know it's bad for me;
But sugar still tastes like sugar - it's still sweet...
It's still sweet...
It's still sweet...
It's still sweet...
You're still sweet...
