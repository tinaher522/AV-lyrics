<song artist="Leona_Lewis" title="Summertime">
Summertime
When the livin' is easy
Fish are jumpin'
And the cotton is high
You're daddy's rich
And your mom is good lookin'
So hush little baby
Don't you cry
One of these mornings
You're gonna rise up singing
Then you spread your wings
And fly to the sky
But till the mornin'
There's nothing can harm you
With mama and daddy
Standing by
One of these mornings
You're rise up singing
Then you spread your wings
And fly to the sky
But till that morning
There's nothing can harm you
With mama and daddy
Standing by
