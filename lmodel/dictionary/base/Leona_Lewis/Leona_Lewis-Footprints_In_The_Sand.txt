<song artist="Leona_Lewis" title="Footprints_In_The_Sand">
You walked with me 
Footprints in the sand 
And helped me understand 
Where I'm going 
You walked with me 
When I was all alone 
With so much unknown 
Along the way 
Then I heard you say 
Chorus 
I promise you 
I'm always there 
When your heart is filled with sorrow and despair 
I'll carry you 
When you need a friend 
You'll find my footprints in the sand 
I see my life 
Flash across the sky 
So many times have I 
Been so afraid 
And just when I 
I thought I'd lost my way 
You gave me strength to carry on 
That's when I heard you say 
Chorus 
When I'm weary 
I know you'll be there 
And I can feel you 
When you say 
Chorus x 2
