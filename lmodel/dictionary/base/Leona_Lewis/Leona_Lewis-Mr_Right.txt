<song artist="Leona_Lewis" title="Mr_Right">
Mr. Right, Mr. Right, Mr. Right
Mr. Right, Mr. Right, Mr. Right
I turn the radio on
Tell them play another song
Don't you know the holidays just make me blue?
It won't Christmas without you
I try to make it on my own
But this house don't feel like a home
2000 miles away tonight, tonight
Don't you know that I'm so lonely this Christmas? (Yeah, yeah)
Ooh, ooh, Santa come help me tonight
Ooh, ooh, make every wish come tonight
Just one thing I need you to bring me for Christmas, and that's my baby
Ooh, ooh, Santa come save me tonight
There's nothing I need under my tree
I just want Mr Right
Don't wanna look outside
Snow is falling from the sky
All I see is couples walking hand in hand
But I'm the one without my man
I try to make it on my own
But this house, it don't feel like a home
2000 miles away tonight, tonight
Don't you know that I'm so lonely this Christmas? (Yeah, yeah)
Ooh, ooh, Santa come help me tonight
Ooh, ooh, make every wish come tonight
Just one thing I need you to bring me for Christmas, and that's my baby
Ooh, ooh, Santa come save me tonight
There's nothing I need under my tree
I just want Mr Right
So if Santa Clause is real, and he know just how I feel
Ooh baby, so baby, all I want is you
And when I open my eyes
Will you be lying by my side?
Ooh baby (ooh baby) So baby
All I want is you
Mr. Right, Mr. Right, Mr. Right
Mr. Right, Mr. Right, Mr. Right
Don't you know that I'm so lonely this Christmas? (Yeah, yeah)
Ooh, ooh, Santa come help me tonight
Ooh, ooh, make every wish come tonight
Just one thing I need you to bring me for Christmas, and that's my baby
Ooh, ooh, Santa come save me tonight
There's nothing I need under my tree
I just want Mr Right
