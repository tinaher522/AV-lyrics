<song artist="Leona_Lewis" title="Come_Alive">
I don't mind if it rains for a century;
I don't mind the rain...
I don't mind if you're here lying next to me;
I don't mind the pain...
So put it on me... put it on me, ah...
Put it on me... (I want your love...) Put it on me...
You're my light - I see when I come alive;
I see when I come alive-live-live-live-live...
I revive, I see when I come alive;
I see when I come alive...
Fire runs through my veins at the speed of light;
Fire through my veins... (I want your love, I want your love...)
A thousand suns lead the way to an endless night;
I embrace the pain... (I want your love, I want your love...)
So put it on me... put it on me, ah...
Put it on me... (I want your love...) Put it on me...
You're my light - I see when I come alive;
I see when I come alive-live-live-live-live...
I revive, I see when I come alive;
I see when I come alive...
(See when I come alive...) Put it on me... (I want your love...) (See when I come alive...)
(See when I come alive...) Put it on me... (I want your love...)
I don't mind if it rains for a century;
I don't mind the rain... (See when I come alive...) [I don't mind the pain!]
So put it on me... put it on me, ah...
Put it on me... I want your love... Put it on me...
You're my light - I see when I come alive;
I see when I come alive-live-live-live-live...
I revive, I see when I come alive; (I see you...)
I see when I come alive...
[Put it on me...] (See when I come alive...) [I want your love...]
I see you... [Put it on me...] (See when I come alive...) [I want your love...]
See when I come alive...
