<song artist="Leona_Lewis" title="Broken">
Mmmmm Hmmm Mhmhmmm
If You can take away all my love
What do I need you for?
You can take away all these words
There's no meaning anymore
You can take away everything leave me lying on the floor
All those sorrys, we can't go back to the start
You can't fix me, I'm torn apart
I wanna run away from love
This time I have had enough
Everytime I feel your touch,
I'm broken
Shattered all the pieces apart
Never thought I'd fall so hard
I'm putting back together my heart,
I'm broken
You can take these photographs,
Watch them fade away
You can throw away all these letters
I don't care about what they say
All those sorrys, there's  a million reasons why
You can't mend me, don't even try
I wanna run away from love
This time I have had enough
Everytime I feel your touch,
I'm broken
Shattered all the pieces apart
Never thought I'd fall so hard
I'm putting back together my heart,
I'm broken
I know it's gonna take some time
To finally realize
I got nothing left inside
Nothing to hide
I'm broken, I'm broken
I'm broken, I'm broken
Inside
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Save me!
I wanna run away from love
This time I have had enough
Everytime I feel your touch,
I'm broken
Shattered all the pieces apart
Never thought I'd fall so hard
I'm putting back together my heart,
I'm broken
