<song artist="Leona_Lewis" title="The_Essence_Of_Me">
Let me take these clothes off
Throw them in the fire
Blowing hair in the wind
Let spirit guide me
No limitations
It a brand new dawn
Onto new horizons
This is who I am
This is what I want
Oh I'm breaking free
I'm taking the leap
These water are deep
I'm feeling, I'm feeling
The essence of me
These mountains are steep
But there's not stopping me
I'm feeling, I'm feeling
The essence of me
The eh eh eh eh essence of me
The eh eh eh eh essence of me
I've been everything you wanted me to be
Let you chip away at my self esteem
You spoke so loud I couldn't hear myself
But now your ugly judgments
No longer pin me down
You can't pin me down!
They can pin me down!
Oh I'm breaking free
I'm taking the leap
These water are deep
I'm feeling, I'm feeling
The essence of me
These mountains are steep
But there's not stopping me
I'm feeling, I'm feeling
The essence of me
The eh eh eh eh essence of me
The eh eh eh eh essence of me
I'm standing at the fences
I still gotta overcome
Everyday a little victory
Take them one by one
I'm waking up stronger
Putting on my gloves
Now its on
Bring it on bring it on
Oh I'm breaking free
I'm taking the leap
These water are deep
I'm feeling, I'm feeling
The essence of me
These mountains are steep
But there's not stopping me
I'm feeling, I'm feeling
The essence of me
The eh eh eh eh essence of me
The eh eh eh eh essence of me
Got nothing to fear but my own fears
