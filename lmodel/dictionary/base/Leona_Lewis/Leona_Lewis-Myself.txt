<song artist="Leona_Lewis" title="Myself">
Girl what we've been through
After all that I've done
I was untrue
I thought I finally had someone
You were my one
And I was your sun
We would be one
And after you gave me your trust
Now I don't really have no one
All I really got is myself (All I really got is myself)
All I really got is myself
And after you gave me your love
Now I don't really have no one
All I really got is myself
All I really got is myself
I know you feel lost
For breaking it off
But its not my fault
Cuz you want to have it your way
Boy tell me why
It kills me inside
Cuz you had no right
And after I gave you my trust
Cuz I don't really have no one
All I really got is myself (All I really got is myself)
All I really got is myself
And after I gave you my love
Now I don't really have no one
All I really got is myself
All I really got is myself
Boy you should have known (you should've known, should've known, should've known)
But you have not gone
Well sorry baby, forgive me
Just give me one more try
No I dont wanna fuss and fight
Don't need this in my life
And after you gave me your love
Now I don't really have no one
I don't really have no one
All I really got is myself
All I really got is myself
All I really got is myself
And after I gave you my love
Cuz I don't really have no one
All I really got is myself
All I really got is myself
And after I gave you my love
Now I don't really have no one
All I really got is myself
All I really got is myself
And after I gave you my love
Cuz I don't really have no one
All I really got is myself
All I really got is myself
