<song artist="Leona_Lewis" title="Perfection">
I was blind I was lost
How did I find you?
I lost drawn, pain to cost
Tell me how did I find you?
Was it chance? Was it faith?
Much too good to contemplate
Now I thank God everyday
What more can I say?
You are perfection
That is what you are
I see perfection
In your faults and scars
Because you love me
And swear that you see
Perfection in me
Upon reflection, you are perfection
You were calm, you were kind
How did I find you?
I was out of my mind
I don't have to remind you
But with love and with faith
I learned it's not to late
And I thank God everyday
What more can I say?
You are perfection
That is what you are
I see perfection
In your faults and scars
Because you love me
And swear that you see
Perfection in me
Upon reflection, you are perfection
Anyone who says there is nothing perfect in this world
Doesn't know you they don't know you
There is so much soul in everything you do
Liftin me up, I can see love, unafraid
What more can I say?
You are perfection
That is what you are
I see perfection
In your faults and scars
Because you love me
And swear that you see
Perfection in me
Upon reflection, you are perfection
You are perfection
