<song artist="Leona_Lewis" title="Stay">
Hahhhhh hahhhhh
I would hold you forever
But the morning comes to soon
I lie awake here just to watch you breath
Sunlight on your shoulders
Cast a hacks over me
Turns a precious night into
The darkest day
If I could only stay
Stay
Could we hold each others breath
And stop the stars burning
Stay
Stay
I'd give everything I have
To stop the world from turning
Haaaaaaa haaaaaaa haaaaaaa
Haaaaaaa haaaaaaa
Let me have this moment
Let me hide it inside your heart
Let tomorrow comes in takes it all away
Part of you will stay
Stay
Could we hold each others breath
And stop the stars burning
Stay
Stay
I'd give everything I have
To stop the world from turning
Your all I need
Your my heart
Your my soul
Your my everything
And I phase away
Part of me will stay
Ohhhhhohhhhhhhhhh
A part of you will stay
Stay
Could we hold each others breath
And stop the stars burning
Stay
Stay ooooo
I'd give everything I have
To stop the world from turning
Everything I have
To stop the world from turning
If I could only stay
Haaaaaaa haaaaaaa haaaaaaa
