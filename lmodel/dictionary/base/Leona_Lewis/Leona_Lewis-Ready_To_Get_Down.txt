<song artist="Leona_Lewis" title="Ready_To_Get_Down">
Do you wanna get down baby tell me if you wanna get down baby
Do you wanna get down baby tell me if you're ready
I saw you walking flossing boy you caught my eye
You made me glad I came here tonight
I wanna be the first to dance with you right now they're playing my song
Can I see if you wanna get it on?
But you're looking kind of right
Why you standing against the wall
I wanna dance with you tonight
Lets forget about the small talk
All that I need to know is
Are you ready do you wanna get down?
Cause I just wanna dance with you
You look like you're good tonight
Cause really ready ready to get down
So won't you show me what you wanna do
I can see in your eyes you specialise in making your body work
Gonna give me what I deserve
And yes I'm ready to receive you gonna give you all I got
And I know that you'll be keeping me hot
But you're looking kind of right
Why you standing against the wall
I wanna dance with you tonight
Lets forget about the small talk
All that I need to know is
Are you ready do you wanna get down?
Cause I just wanna dance with you
You look like you're good tonight
Cause really ready ready to get down
So won't you show me what you wanna do
