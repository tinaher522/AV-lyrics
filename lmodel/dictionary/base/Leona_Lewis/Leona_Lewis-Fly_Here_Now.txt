<song artist="Leona_Lewis" title="Fly_Here_Now">
Doesn't matter what you say
Just tell me what would you do
When I miss you like this baby
Gotta teleport your molecules
give you wings so you can fly
Hi-i-i-i-igh
I'd give you wings so you could fly to me across the sky
I'm tired of talking baby
Say yes or no not maybe
I need your body here with me
(I need your body here with me)
This might sound crazy but
Just fly here right now
Glide like an airplane and
Just fly here right now
There's nothing there to hold you down
there's nobody that's strong enough
Aren't you tired of living on the ground
Well tonight we're going to live it up
Take a trip across the sky
Hi-i-i-i-igh
Spread your wings and fly
This aint a hard decision
Your stronger than jet engines
There's no excuse for you to be
there's no excuse for you to be so far from me
This might sound crazy but
Just fly here right now
Glide like an airplane and
Just fly here right now
People say that we
We can't fly
But we can defy
Gravity tonight we'll fly
People say that we
We can't fly
But we can defy
Gravity
If we can just do something crazy
This might sound crazy but
Just fly here right now
Glide like an airplane and
Just fly here right now
This might sound crazy but
Just fly here right now
Glide like an airplane and
Just fly here right now
