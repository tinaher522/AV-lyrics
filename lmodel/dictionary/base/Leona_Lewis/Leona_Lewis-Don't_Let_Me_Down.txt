<song artist="Leona_Lewis" title="Don't_Let_Me_Down">
Fork in the road, 
Looking both ways, I, 
Don't know which way to go. 
What do I count on? 
Do I take the road less traveled? 
Or the one I already know? 
And no I'm not traveling alone. 
I got my heart in my hand, And, 
You can bet I'm holding it close. 
Don't wanna climb, 
Don't wanna fall, 
Don't know where to start it all. 
I can start by taking it slow. 
First I need a, hero, 
I got a, mirror, 
Looking inside of my soul. 
If I need a, hero, 
I got my, mirror, 
Gotta go on with the show. 
I got my ear to the ground; 
That's the sound of my train comin' 'round. 
This is a chance for us to be heard loud. 
It's you and me, 
And it's our time now. 
Don't let me down. 
Justin Timberlake: 
Don't let me down, 
Don't let me down now, 
Don't let me down, 
Don't let me down now. 
Leona Lewis: 
People! 
This is what you're living your life for. 
Fighter, 
That's your name (JT: That's your name) 
Trying to hide but it's obvious you're a survivor. 
Believer, 
Don't let the travel in the road - 
That look in your eyes, 
Puts fire in the heart of the cold (world). 
Got a marathon to try again, 
I'm not even tryin' to win. 
I'm just glad I'm not alone. 

First I need a, hero, 
I got a, mirror, 
Looking inside of my soul. 
If I need a, hero, 
I get my, mirror, 
Gotta go on with the show. 
I got my ear to the ground; 
That's the sound of my train comin' 'round. 
This is a chance for us to be heard loud. 
It's you and me, 
And it's our time now. 
Don't let me down. 
Leona Lewis: 
Don't you let me down, 
Promise you won't let me down. 
Don't you let me down, 
Promise you won't let me down. 
You've been running so alone. 
I see you (I see you). 
You told me we could change the world. 
And I believe it's true. 
There's nothing now to hold us down. 
I found, 
My pains, 
And the sound of your heart led the way. 
I got my ear to the ground; 
That's the sound of my train comin' 'round. (comin' round) 
This is a chance for us to be heard loud. 
It's you and me, 
And it's our time now. 
Don't let me down! 
Don't you let me down, (Don't let me down) 
Promise you won't let me down, (JT: Don't let me down now) 
Don't let me down,(JT: Don't let me down now) 
Promise you won't let me down, (JT: Don't let me down now) 
Justin Timberlake: 
Don't let me down, 
Don't let me down now, 
Don't let me down, 
Don't let me down now.
