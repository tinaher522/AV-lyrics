<song artist="Leona_Lewis" title="No_One">
I just want you close
Where you can stay stay forever 
You can be so (oh~oh~oh~oh~oh~oh~oh~oh~oh~oh) 
And it will only get better
You and me together
Through the days and nights
I don't worry 'cause
Everything's gonna be alright
No one
No one
No one (un~un~un~un~un)
Can get in the way of what I'm feeling
No one
No one
No one (un~un~un~un~un)
Can get in the way of what I feel for you
When the rain is pouring down (ow~ow~ow~ow~ow~ow~ow~own)
And my heart is hurtin'
You will always be so(oh~oh~oh~oh~oh~oh~oh~oh~oh0
'Cause I know for certain
You and me together
Through the days and nights
I don't worry 'cause 
Everything's gonna be alright
No one
No one
No one (un~un~un~un~un)
Can get in the way of what I feel for you
You-ooh
You-ooh
Can get in the way of what I feel for you 
I know-oh
Some people search the world
To fi-ind 
Somethin' like what we have
I know-oh
People keep tryin'
Tryin' to find
Something so rea-eal
And 'til the end of time I'm tellin' you there's no one
No one
No one (un~un~un~un~un 
Can get in the way of what I feel for you
