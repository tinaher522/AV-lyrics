<song artist="Leona_Lewis" title="I_Know_Who_I_Am">
They say you never see it coming
All the tiny little breaks
But somewhere out beyond all reason
You keep on giving what it takes
I never thought of running
I was busy carrying the load
Had the strength enough to take it
But not enough to let it go
It's a long time coming down a broken road
[Chorus]
And finally I can feel without fearing
Cry without the pain
Stand up and love me
Without any shame
It might have been a rough way to learn it 
And a hard place to land
But the one thing I'm sure of now
Is I know who I am
Now if somebody would have told me
There was a better place to be
In my quiet desperation
It was too hard to believe
I guess you gotta go the distance
To know just when enough's, enough
Won't let nobody take it from me
Cause I know what I'm made of
And there's nothing I can't rise above
[Chorus]
And finally I can feel without fearing
Cry without the pain
Stand up and love me
Without any shame
It might have been a rough way to learn it
And a hard place to land
But the one thing I'm sure of now
Is I know who I am
(I am) A woman who's worthy
(I am) A woman's deserving 
Whatever it is I can take it 
Whatever it takes I'm gonna make it yeah
[Chorus]
And finally I can feel without fearing
Cry without the pain
Stand up and love me
Without any shame
It might have been a rough way to learn it
And a hard place to land
But the one thing I'm sure of now
Oh, and I absolutely have no doubt
Yeah, I know who I am
Yeah, I know who I am
I Know
