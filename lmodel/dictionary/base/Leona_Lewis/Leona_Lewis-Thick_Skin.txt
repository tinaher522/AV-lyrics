<song artist="Leona_Lewis" title="Thick_Skin">
You can say anything you wanna say
Hate me, but I'm gonna love you anyway
If you didn't have a wall to hide behind
Bet you fell to pieces when your eyes met mine
You can throw your daggers, you can sink 'em in
It don't matter, I got thick skin
You can knock me down, but I'll get up again
'Cause I'm stronger than your bruises, I got thick skin
'Cause I'm stronger than your bruises, I got thick skin
Every time you find another stone to throw
I will pick it up and start to build a wall
Keep up your attack, because with every blow
You are only adding to my castle
You can throw your daggers, you can sink 'em in
It don't matter, I got thick skin
You can knock me down, but I'll get up again
Cause I'm stronger than your bruises, I got thick skin
You can throw your daggers, you can sink 'em in
It don't matter, I got thick skin
You can knock me down, but I'll get up again
Stronger than your bruises, I got thick skin
Stronger than your bruises, I got thick skin
Stronger than your bruises, I got thick skin
