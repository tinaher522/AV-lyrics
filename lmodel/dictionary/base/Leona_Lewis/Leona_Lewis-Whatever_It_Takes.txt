<song artist="Leona_Lewis" title="Whatever_It_Takes">
People say love comes and goes but 
They don't understand what they don't know 
‘Cause what I feel starts deep inside 
It's planted like a seed that springs into life 
They say it's not right and we move too fast 
But they don't know the meaning of what we have 
Chorus 
Wherever it is I'll fly 
Whatever it takes I'll try 
So don't pay no mind to what other people say 
Whatever it is my life know that I will be on time 
‘Cause you know why there's no standing in our way 
When you're far and we're apart 
I'm really missing you I wanna be where you are 
They says it's not right and it won't last 
They never would believe in what we have 
Chorus 
And if you're lost I'll come and find you 
‘Cause without you I'll break down and cry 
And you know I I want to surround you 
With all my life 
Is I'll fly 
Takes I'll try 
Baby don't pay no mind to what other people say 
In my life 
You know I'll be on time 
You know why there's no standing in our way 
Chorus
