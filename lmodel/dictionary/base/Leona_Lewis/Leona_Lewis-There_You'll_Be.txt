<song artist="Leona_Lewis" title="There_You'll_Be">
When I think back on these times,
And the dreams we left behind,
I'll be glad cause I was blessed to get,
To have you in my life,
When I look back on these days,
I look and see your face,
You were right there for me.
Bridge:
In my dreams I've always seen you soar above the sky,
In my heart there'll always be a place for you,
For all my life,
Chorus:
I'll keep a part of you with me,
And everywhere I am there you'll be,
And everywhere I am there you'll be,
Well you showed me how it feels,
To feel the sky within my reach,
And I always will remember all,
The strength you gave to me,
Your love made me make it through,
Ohh I owe so much to you,
You were right there for me.
Bridge:
In my dreams I've always seen you soar above the sky,
In my heart there'll always be a place for you,
For all my life,
Chorus:
I'll keep a part of you with me,
And everywhere I am there you'll be,
Cause I always saw you in my life, my strength,
And I wanna thank you now for all the ways,
You were right there for me, you were right there for me
Always!!
Bridge:
In my dreams I've always seen you soar above the sky,
In my heart there'll always be a place for you,
For all my life,
Chorus:
I'll keep a part of you with me,
And everywhere I am there you'll be,
And everywhere I am there you'll be,
There You'll Be
