<song artist="Leona_Lewis" title="I_Will_Be">
There's nothing I could say to you 
Nothing I could ever do to make you see 
What you mean to me 
All the pain the tears I cried 
Still you never said goodbye 
And now I know 
How far you'd go 
I know I let you down 
But it's not like that now 
This time I'll never 
Let you go 
I will be 
All that you want 
And get myself together 
‘Cause you keep me from falling apart 
All my life 
I'll be with you forever 
To get you through the day 
And make everything OK 
I thought that I had everything 
I didn't know what life could bring 
But now I see honestly 
You're the one thing I got right 
The only one I let inside 
Now I can't breathe 
‘cause you're here with me 
And if I let you down 
I'd turn it all around 
‘Cause I would never 
Let you go 
I will be 
All that you want 
And get myself together 
‘Cause you keep me from falling apart 
All my life 
I'll be with you forever 
To get you through the day 
And make everything OK 

‘Cause without you 
I can't breathe 
I'm not gonna ever ever let you leave 
You're all I‘ve got 
You're all I want 
‘Cause without you 
I don't know what I'd do 
I could never ever live a day without you 
Here with me do you see 
You're all I need 
I will be 
All that you want 
And get myself together 
‘Cause you keep me from falling apart 
All my life 
I'll be with you forever 
To get you through the day 
And make everything OK 
I will be 
All that you want 
And get myself together 
‘Cause you keep me from falling apart 
All my life 
I'll be with you forever 
To get you through the day 
And make everything OK
