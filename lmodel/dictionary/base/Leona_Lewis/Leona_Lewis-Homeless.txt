<song artist="Leona_Lewis" title="Homeless">
Waiting here for you to call me 
For you to tell me that everything's a big mistake 
Waiting here in this rainfall feeling so small 
This dream was not supposed to break 
I'm so sorry now for the pain I caused you 
Won't you please forgive please 
Chorus 
But you don't love me anymore 
You don't want me anymore 
And there's a sign on your door 
No vacancies just emptiness 
Without your love I'm homeless 
In this cold I'm walking aimless 
Feeling helpless without a shelter from the storm 
And in my heart I miss you so much 
I'm missing your touch and the bed that used to be so warm 
I'm so sorry now for the pain I've caused you 
Won't you please forgive please 
Chorus 
Oh my baby I'm sorry sorry 
Chorus
