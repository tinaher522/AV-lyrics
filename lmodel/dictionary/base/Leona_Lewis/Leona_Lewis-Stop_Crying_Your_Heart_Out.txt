<song artist="Leona_Lewis" title="Stop_Crying_Your_Heart_Out">
Hold up... hold on... don't be scared, 
You'll never change what's been and gone. 
May your smile... Shine on... 
Don't be scared, 
Your destiny may keep you warm.
Cos all of the stars have faded away, 
Just try not to worry,
You'll see them some day. 
Take what you need,
And be on your way, 
And stop crying your heart out. 
Get up... Come on... why you scared? 
You'll never change what's been and gone. 
Cos all of the stars have faded away, 
Just try not to worry, 
You'll see them some day. 
Take what you need,
And be on your way,
And stop crying your heart out. 
Cos all of the stars have faded away, 
Just try not to worry,
You'll see them some day. 
Just take what you need,
And be on your way, 
And stop crying your heart out. 
When all of the stars were faded away, 
Just try not to worry,
You'll see us some day. 
Just take what you need,
And be on your way, 
And stop crying your heart out.
Stop crying your heart out. (3x)
