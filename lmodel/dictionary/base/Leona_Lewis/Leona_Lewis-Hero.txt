<song artist="Leona_Lewis" title="Hero">
I was fearless, flying, loveless
Nowhere to nowhere
Falling earthbound, I never looked down
Grasping the feeling 
Did someone hear me say
Chorus
I never needed a hero
I never needed a hero
Tell me who sent you
Tell me how they knew
My heartbeat was fading
My body was needing a Hero
(uuuuh ah uuuh ah)
some kinda hero (uuuuh ah uuuh ah)
I built these walls so high, so tall
No one could get in
You kept climbing you kept on fighting
Always believing
Chorus
I never needed a hero
I never needed a hero
Tell me who sent you
Tell me how they knew
My heartbeat was fading
My body anekatips was leaving
Tell me who sent you to come to the rescue
A hero, (uuuuh ah uuuh ah)
some kinda hero (uuuuh ah uuuh ah)
Some kinda hero (uuuuh ah uuuh ah)
Some kinda hero (uuuuh ah uuuh ah)
Suddenly, we’re face to face
There’s nowhere left to hide
As brick by brick you tear me down
Uncover what’s inside
Did someone hear me say
I needed a hero, I needed a hero
I never needed a hero
I never needed a hero
Tell me who sent you
Tell me how they knew
My heartbeat was fading
That My heartbeat was fading
My body was needing
Tell me who sent you
to come to the rescue
I needed a hero, I needed a hero

(uuuuh ah uuuh ah)
Some kinda hero
(uuuuh ah uuuh ah)
some kinda hero
(uuuuh ah uuuh ah)
Some kinda hero
(uuuuh ah uuuh ah)
I was fearless, flying, loveless,
Nowhere to nowhere
