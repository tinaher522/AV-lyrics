<song artist="Leona_Lewis" title="My_Hands">
I wake in the morning
Tired of sleeping
Get in the shower
And make my bed alone
I put on my makeup
Talking to the mirror
Ready for a new day
Without you
And I walk steady on my feet
I talk my voice obeys me
I go out at night
Sleep without the lights
And I do all of the things
I have to
Keeping you off my mind
But when I think I'll be alright
I am always wrong cause
My hands
don't wanna start again
My hands
No, they don't wanna understand
My hands
They just shake and try to break
whatever peace I may find
My hands
They only agree to hold
Your hands
And they don't wanna be without
Your hands
And they will not let me go
No, they will not let me go
I talk about you now
And go a day without crying
I go out with my friends now
I stay home all alone
I don't see you everywhere
I can say your name easily
I laugh a bit louder
Without you
And I see different shades now
And I'm almost never afraid now
But when I think I'll be okay
I am always wrong cause
My hands
don't wanna start again
My hands
No they don't wanna understand
My hands
They just shake and try to break
whatever peace I may find
My hands
They only agree to hold
Your hands
And they don't wanna be without
Your hands
And they will not let me go
No they will not let me go
Sometimes I wake and
see them reaching out for you
Quietly breaking
whatever shields
I spent so long building up
I cannot fake, cos
when they cry I'm
unspoken
They miss holding my baby
My hands
No they don't wanna understand
They just shake and try to break
whatever peace I may find
My hands
Your hands
They don't want to be without
Your hands
They will not let me go
Not they will not let me go
My hands
They don't wanna start again
My hands
No they don't wanna understand
My hands
They just shake and try to break
whatever peace I may find
My hands
They only agree to hold
Your hands
And they don't wanna be without
Your hands
And they will not let me go
No they will not let me go
No they will not let me go
