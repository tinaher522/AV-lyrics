<song artist="Leona_Lewis" title="You_Don't_Care">
All those tears from yesterday, they didn't wash away the pain
So long overdue, those tears were for you
Don't say you love me again just because you see the end
Don't act like you care, it's too late to pretend
I never wanted to burn outrageous but I'm so tired
So hard to walk away but I can't wish for yesterday
'Cause I don't wanna lose you, I don't wanna lose you
But it's so hard when you don't care anymore
Our love was amazing, now it's not worth saving
Something tells me you don't care, you don't care anymore
Someday soon you'll understand when no one's there to hold your hand
When loneliness is your only friend
I'm not saying there won't be another time for you and me
I won't let love die or let you hurt me again
Never wanted to burn outrageous but I'm so tired
I don't wanna walk away but I can't wish for yesterday
I don't wanna lose you, I don't wanna lose you
But it's so hard when you don't care anymore
Our love was amazing, now it's not worth saving
Something tells me you don't care, you don't care anymore
Someday when you're all alone
When you've got no hand to hold you will think of me
I don't wanna lose you , don't wanna lose you
Something tells me you don't care, you don't care
I don't wanna lose you, I don't wanna lose you
But it's so hard when you don't care anymore
Our love was amazing, now it's not worth saving
Something tells me you don't care, you don't care anymore
Anymore, you don't care anymore, you don't care anymore
You don't care, you don't care anymore
