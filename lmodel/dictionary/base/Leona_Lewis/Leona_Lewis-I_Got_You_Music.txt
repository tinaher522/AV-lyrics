<song artist="Leona_Lewis" title="I_Got_You_Music">
A place to crash, i got you
No need to ask, i got you
Just get on the phone, i got you 
Come and pick you up if i have to
What's weired about it is we're right at the end
Im mad about it, just figured it out in my head
Im proud to say i got you
Go ahead and say goodbye, i'll be alright
Go ahead and make me cry, i'll be alright
And when you need a place to run to
For better, for worse, i got you
