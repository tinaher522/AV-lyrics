<song artist="Leona_Lewis" title="Lost_Then_Found">
I'm staring at tears on the pages
Of letters that I never could write
And I know love isn't painless 
but it's worth the risk it's worth the fight
I'm playing it over and over 
I wish that I could turn back time
Baby we're wrong but we could be right
OneRepublic:
Why do we say things we can't take back 
And why do we miss what we never had 
Both of us fell to the ground 
The love was so lost it couldn't be found 
What would it take to forget who's blamed
I'm tired of crying at the sound of your name
Why don't we turn this around 
Love ain't the enemy 
Don't you wanna be 
Lost then found
Lost then found
Lost then found
Love ain't the enemy 
We could be lost then found
OneRepublic:
Empty glasses and tables
Echoes fill these rooms
The memories go where we go 
They're like the suitcase that you never lose
The good lords eye is upon me 
I swear to make things right
Whatever we've lost I know we can find
OneRepublic:
Why do we say things we can't take back 
And why do we miss what we never had 
Both of us fell to the ground 
The love was so lost it couldn't be found 
What would it take to forget who's blamed
I'm tired of crying at the sound of your name
Why don't we turn this around 
Love ain't the enemy 
Don't you wanna be 
Lost then found
The winds are calling up we can't stop the rain 
Wish that you could take it back but it's to late 
It's to late
Why do we say things we can't take back 
And why do we miss what we never had 
Both of us fell to the ground 
The love was so lost it couldn't be found 
What would it take to forget who's blamed
I'm tired of crying at the sound of your name
Why don't we turn this around 
Love ain't the enemy 
Don't you wanna be 
Lost then found
Lost then found
Lost then found
Love ain't the enemy
We could be lost then found
The words came pouring out
Can't stop the rain
Wish you could take it back
But it's too late, it's too late
We could be lost then found
