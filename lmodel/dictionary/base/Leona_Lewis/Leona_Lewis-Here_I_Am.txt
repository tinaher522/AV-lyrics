<song artist="Leona_Lewis" title="Here_I_Am">
This is a crazy world 
These can be lonely days 
It's hard to know who's on your side most of the time 
Who can you really trust 
Who do you really know 
Is there anybody out there who can make you feel less alone 
Sometimes you just can't make it on your own 
Chorus 
If you need a place where you can run 
If you need a shoulder to cry on 
I'll always be your friend 
When you need some shelter from the rain 
When you need a healer for your pain 
I will be there time and time again 
When you need someone to love you here I am 
If you have broken dreams 
Just lay them all on me 
I'll be the one who understands so take my hand 
If there is emptiness 
You know I'll do my best 
To fill you up with all the love that I can show someone 
I promise you you'll never walk alone 
Chorus 
Everybody needs somebody who 
They can pour their heart and soul into 
Chorus 
Here I am
