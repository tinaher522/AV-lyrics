<song artist="Leona_Lewis" title="L.o.v.e.u">
Lately I don't know what's coming over me
Keep on thinking about what we could be
Now I know we're just friends, is there more to us
Can't help thinking that just ain't enough
I'm into you and what you do
Lets make a move baby you lead the way
Head over heals is how I feel you know the deal
I think that you feel the same
Oh is this for real
Everything that you can make feel
Oh it's time that I L.O.V.E
Oh is this for true I can see myself tripping on you
And oh oh it's time that you L.O.V.E
I know some people say that
When you're friends you're friends
Make a move and your relationship ends
But I am a chancer in life and I can take my heart
Better to have loved and lost then never to have love at all
I'm into you and what you do
Let's make a move baby you lead the way
Head over heels is how I feel you know the deal
I know that you feel the same
Oh is this for real
Everything that you can make feel
Oh it's time that I L.O.V.E
Oh is this for true I can see myself tripping on you
And oh oh it's time that you L.O.V.E
Take a chance and my hand
Discover a whole new land
If we don't we'll never know what we could be
Boy you better L.O.V.E love me
Cause I am gonna L.O.V.E love you
How I'm gonna love you
I am gonna love you
Are you gonna tell me
How you're gonna love me
Oh is this for real
Everything that you can make feel
Oh it's time that I L.O.V.E
Oh is this for true I can see myself tripping on you
And oh oh it's time that you L.O.V.E
