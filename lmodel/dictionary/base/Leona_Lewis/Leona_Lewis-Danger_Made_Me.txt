<song artist="Leona_Lewis" title="Danger_Made_Me">
I should have told you,
I've got a little wild side.
Baby, I should have warned you,
Once I see the strobe lights,
I can be anyone you want, anyone you want,
Just not me.
I can be anyone you want, anyone you want,
Just not me.
I loved you on the dancefloor,
But the danger made me do it.
I loved you on the dancefloor,
But the danger made me do it.
The danger made me do it,
The danger made me.
I loved you on the dancefloor,
But the danger made me do it.
I should have told you,
I'm like Jekyll and Hyde.
Baby, I should have stopped you,
From running to the dark side.
I can be anyone you want, anyone you want,
Make believe.
I can be anyone you want, anyone you want,
Just not me.
I loved you on the dancefloor,
But the danger made me do it.
I loved you on the dancefloor,
But the danger made me do it.
The danger made me do it,
The danger made me.
I loved you on the dancefloor,
But the danger made me do it.
The danger made me do it,
The danger made me.
The danger made me do it,
The danger made me.
I loved you on the dancefloor,
But the danger made me do it.
I loved you on the dancefloor,
But the danger made me do it.
I loved you on the dancefloor,
But the danger made me do it.
I loved you on the dancefloor,
But the danger made me do it.
The danger made me do it,
The danger made me.
I loved you on the dancefloor,
But the danger made me do it.
