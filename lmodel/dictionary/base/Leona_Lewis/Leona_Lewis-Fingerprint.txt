<song artist="Leona_Lewis" title="Fingerprint">
Circles with no end;
The ink that stains my skin...
Secrets of where you've been
Is the only thing that I keep...
No match, no match, no match for your fingerprint;
No substitute, no other you...
No match, no match, no match for your fingerprint;
No substitute, no other you...
Bursting for one sip
Of the innocence we once had...
Shadows of the past,
And the tattooed lines of your kiss...
No match, no match, no match for your fingerprint;
No substitute, no other you...
'Cause there can only be one;
There can only be one...
Circles with no end;
The ink that stains my skin...
No match, no match, no match for your fingerprint;
No substitute, no other you...
'Cause there can only be one;
There can only be one...
There can only be one....
There can only be one...
