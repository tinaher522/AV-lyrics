<song artist="Leona_Lewis" title="Angel">
I feel it, you feel it
That this was meant to be 
I know it, you know it
That you were made for me 
We can't deny this any longer 
Day by day it's getting stronger 
I want it and you want it 
It's what the people wanna see 
We're like Romeo and Juliet 
Families can't divide us 
Like the tallest mountain or the widest sea 
Nothing's big enough to hide us 
When we make love its overwhelming 
I just touched the heavens 
You're an angel 
You're an angel 
I said 
Chorus 
This world, this world 
Could leave us any day 
But my love for you it will never go away 
And I don't wanna go to sleep 
Cause you are like a dream 
For every night I say a prayer
Well I swear you are the answer 
You're an angel 
You're an angel 
You're an angel 
So we take it and each moment our love grows 
I say it and you say it
What we have is made of gold 
We're so filled with meaning
Nothing can make us shallow 
So I hold it and you hold it
The promise of tomorrow 
So when we make love it's overwhelming 
I just touch the heavens 
You're an angel 
You're an angel 
And I said 
Chorus 
I don't need three wishes,
Well I just need one 
For us to never be finished,
For us to never be done 
When they say it's over,
We'll just say I love you 
And when they say it's finished,
We'll just keep on building 
Chorus x 2 
You're an angel 
You're an angel 
You're an angel 
You're an angel 
You're an angel 
You're an angel
