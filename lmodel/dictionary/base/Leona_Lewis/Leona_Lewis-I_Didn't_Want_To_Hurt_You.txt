<song artist="Leona_Lewis" title="I_Didn't_Want_To_Hurt_You">
I didn't lie
I didn't deceive
I would confess if there was something to conceal
But i realize I tried
And our flame has died and it's so cold
And this how a glass gets empty inside
Our happiness ran out in the hands of time
I try to hold on but everything's gone and I let you go
I didn't mean to hurt you
It's not the way I planned and that's the truth
It's hard to understand 'cause I love you
And I don't want to do this again and again and again
I didn't mean to hurt you
It's tearing me apart and it's the truth
I really wish that I could save you
But I don't want to hurt you again and again and again and again
We started to fade
Just finish away
I tried to hide behind the masquerade
But that's when I knew all I could do is say goodbye
Don't wanna cause you pain
Just let me walk away
Don't tell me that you've changed - 
-I hope you stay the same
I love you the way you are
I don't wanna break your heart
We've just grown apart
I didn't mean to hurt you
It's not the way I planned and that's the truth
It's hard to understand 'cause I love you
And I don't want to do this again and again and again
I didn't mean to hurt you
It's tearing me apart and it's the truth
I really wish that I could save you
But I don't want to hurt you again, no
How can it be we've disappeared?
What once was us is just not here
So let's not fight
I'm on your side
The more you look, the more you'll find
I didn't mean to hurt you
It's not the way I planned and that's the truth
It's hard to understand 'cause i love you
And I don't wanna do this again and again and again
I didn't mean to hurt you
It's tearing me apart and it's the truth
I really wish that I could save you
But I don't wanna hurt you again, no
