<song artist="Faith_No_More" title="Let's_Lynch_The_Landlord">
The landlord's here to visit
They're blasting disco down below
Says, "I'm doubling the rent
'Cause the buildings condemned.
You're gonna help me buy City Hall."
But we can, you know we can
But we can, you know we can
Let's lynch the landlord man
I tell him turn on the water
I tell him turn on the heat
Tells me "All you ever do is complain."
Then they search the place when I'm not here
But we can, you know we can
We can, you know we can
Let's lynch the landlord
Let's lynch the landlord
Let's lynch the landlord man, oh
There's rats chewin' up the kitchen
Roaches up to my knees
Turn the oven on, it smells like Dachau
Till the rain pours through the ceiling
But we can, you know we can
We can, you know we can
Let's lynch the landlord
Let's lynch the landlord
Let's lynch the landlord man
Landlord man
