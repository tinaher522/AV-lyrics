<song artist="Faith_No_More" title="The_World_Is_Yours">
Keep your distance
You're in the race (?)
Caress me
In your eye I've got better things to do
This will hurt someone
White walls, windows 
Charity(?) 
Courage(?), defenders(?) 
Comfort me and bring me something sharp
This will hurt someone
Someone else 
This will hurt someone else
Calm down, think carefully 
Seen it all before 
Mind your own fucking business 
Seen it all before 
What I would give for your eyes 
Seen it all before 
You would never blink again 
Seen it all before
Faces on top of more faces 
This bullet in your chest, the world is yours 
Each word, you suck it through a straw
It's so predictable, it's policy, uh
This will hurt someone
Someone else
Each word, you suck it through a straw
It's so predictable, it's policy
