<song artist="Faith_No_More" title="The_Cowboy_Song">
Tears fall, they scarred your innocent dreams
Loves fall, they kinda leave you empty
Leaves fall, the seasons pass you by
And you think that maybe you can fly
Ceilings fall, while each romance your incur
Clouds fall, with each moment of despair
Buildings fall, the pavement is their bed
But what's the last thing that goes through your head?
You take the elevator to the top
The next thing you know
There you are standing on the edge
And all the flashing lights and futile cries
They laugh at you now
Just close your eyes and take that final step
Rains fall, they dampen your will to live
Gods fall, which each pleasure that you give
You fall, and take the whole world with you
But will you even bother to look down?
You take the elevator to the top
The next thing you know
There you are standing on the edge
The circumstance it turns you inside out
So we can have peace
Before you find out what's inside your head
What's inside your head!
You take the elevator to the top
The next thing you know
There you are standing on the edge
The circumstance it turns you inside out
So we can have peace
Before you find out whats inside your head
And all the flashing lights and futile cries
They laugh at you now
Just close your eyes and take that final step
And all the flashing lights and futile cries
They laugh at you now
Just close your eyes and take that final step
