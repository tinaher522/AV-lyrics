<song artist="Faith_No_More" title="Got_That_Feeling">
Got that feeling
Luck is just a little of it
I got that feeling
I can't stop winning, I'm winning
A to Z
Look what you're missing, as we speak
Your number's rising, take a peek
There's just enough to go around, get a piece
Your own little piece of hell
Get it, get it, get it, get it
You should go and get it
Get it, get it, get it, get it
You should go and get it
Got that feeling
Loving every minute of it
I got that feeling
I can't stop winning, 'cause I'm winning
Have a drink
A pot of coffee, cannot think
Too many friends here, just an inch
Between striking out and striking rich, just a risk
One I'll take and take again
Get it, get it, get it, get it
You should go and get it
Get it, get it, get it, get it
You should go and get it
Got that feeling
Gotta bet a little of it
Got that feeling
I can't stop winning
And start living
'Cause I'm winning
'Cause I'm living
You can't borrow tomorrow
