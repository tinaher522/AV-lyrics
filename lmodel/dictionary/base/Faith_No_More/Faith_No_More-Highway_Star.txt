<song artist="Faith_No_More" title="Highway_Star">
A special San Francisco treat... treat for you
Nobody gonna take my car, I'm gonna race it to the ground
Nobody gonna beat my car, it's gonna break the speed of sound
Ooh, it's a killing machine  
It's got everything
Like a driving power, big fat tires and everything
I love it, and I need it, I feed it
Yeah, it's a wild hurricane
All right, hold tight, I'm a highway star
All right, hold tight, I'm a highway star
I'm a highway star
I'm a highway star
Treat!
