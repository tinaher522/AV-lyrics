Star A.D.
Star A.D.
See tomorrow dreamin'
You don't need your freedom
Star A.D.
Star A.D.
A little joke that's understood
It's all over the world
A little joke that's understood
It's all over the world
A little joke that's understood
It's all over the world
A little joke that's understood
It's all over and over and over and over, hey
Over, hey
Over, over
And dying is dry
Like a fact of history
And when you die, you'll become
Something worse than dead
You'll become a legend
See tomorrow dreamin'
You don't need your freedom
We are forever
We are forever
We are forever
We are forever
We are forever
We are forever, we
A little joke that's understood
It's all over the world
A little joke that's understood
It's all over the world
A little joke that's understood
It's all over the world
A little joke that's understood
It's all over and over and over and over, ooh
Over, hey
Over, over, hey
