<song artist="Faith_No_More" title="Mouth_To_Mouth">
You tied the knot
A legend is what you bought
I give you cold water and you
Swear it's wine
You bought time
If you can fool yourself, then why not them?
Just keep on passing it
Mouth to mouth to mouth
You tied the knot
A legend is what you bought
I give you cold water and you
Swear it's wine
You bought time
If you can fool yourself, then why not them?
Just keep on passing it
Mouth to mouth to mouth
I can dress up the dead man
But I can't bring him back to life
Bring him back, bring him back
You tied the knot
Peeled your skin off, leaving a bundle of nerves
I give you a wet noodle
You swear that it was my tongue
A sharp one
Instead of that same old mouth
To mouth to mouth to mouth
I can dress up the dead man
But I can't bring him back to life
Bring him back, bring him back
Mouth to mouth, mouth to mouth
Mouth to mouth to mouth
Mouth to mouth, mouth to mouth
Mouth to mouth to mouth
I can dress up the dead man
But I can't bring him back to life
I can dress up the dead man
But I can't bring him back to life
I can dress up the dead man
But I can't bring him back to life
I can dress up the dead man
But I can't bring him back to life
I can dress up the dead man
But I can't bring him back to life
