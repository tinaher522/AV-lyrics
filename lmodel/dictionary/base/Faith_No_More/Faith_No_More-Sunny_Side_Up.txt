<song artist="Faith_No_More" title="Sunny_Side_Up">
I'll be your leprechaun
Shamrock or lucky charm, whoa yeah
Tap-dancing all alone, it's okay
Dip into the sugar bowl, wWoa yeah
Sunny side up
Sunny side up
Such a lovely way to start the day
Sunny side up
Sunny side up
Not the only way to fry an egg
Sunny side up
Sunny side up
I am just a grain of sand on your beach
With all of my heart
All of my heart
A drop of rain through your hands
Rainbows will bend for me, curvy
Honey bees will sting for me, stingin', stingin'
Sunny side up
Sunny side up
Such a lovely way to start the day
Sunny side up
Sunny side up
Dance the night away like Fred Astaire
Come on ride my wave
Ride it all the way
(Sunny side up, Sunny side up)
(Sunny side up, sunny side up, sunny side up)
Till the ocean ends
(Sunny side up, sunny side up)
I'll see you there
(Sunny side up, sunny side up, sunny side up)
