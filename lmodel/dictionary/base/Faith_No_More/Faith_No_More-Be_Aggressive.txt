<song artist="Faith_No_More" title="Be_Aggressive">
I started this
It's all for me
What's yours is mine and mine is mine, that's plain to see
So give it up
I've got to have
I swallow, I swallow, I swallow, I swallow
Be aggressive
B-e aggressive
B-e a-g-g-r-e-s-s-i-v-e
Be aggressive
B-e aggressive
B-e a-g-g-r-e-s-s-i-v-e
What someone else
Would leave behind
And spit it out, let go to waste, I claim is mine
You're my flavor (my flavor)
Of the week
I swallow, I swallow, I swallow, I swallow
Be aggressive
B-e aggressive
B-e a-g-g-r-e-s-s-i-v-e
Be aggressive
B-e aggressive
B-e a-g-g-r-e-s-s-i-v-e
I swallow
I swallow
Agressive (aggressive aggressive)
Tall and reckless
Ugly seed
Reach down my throat, you filthy bird that's all I need
This empty pit
I've got to feed
To prove I'm fit
A healthy man I've got to be
Malnutrition
My submission
You're the master and I take it on my knees
Ejaculation
Tribulation
I swallow, I swallow, I swallow, I swallow
Be aggressive
B-e aggressive
B-e a-g-g-r-e-s-s-i-v-e
Be aggressive (aggressive, aggressive, aggressive)
B-e aggressive
B-e a-g-g-r-e-s-s-i-v-e
Be aggressive
B-e aggressive
B-e a-g-g-r-e-s-s-i-v-e
Go, fight, go, fight, go, fight, win
