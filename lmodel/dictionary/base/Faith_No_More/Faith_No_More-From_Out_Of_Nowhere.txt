<song artist="Faith_No_More" title="From_Out_Of_Nowhere">
Tossed into my mind, stirring the calm
You splash me with beauty and pull me down
'Cause you come from out of nowhere
My glance turns to a stare
Obsession rules me, I'm yours from the start
I know you see me, our eyes interlock
'Cause you come from out of nowhere
My glance turns to a stare
One minute here and one minute there
Don't know if I'll laugh or cry
One minute here and one minute there
And then you wave good-bye...
Sifting to the bottom, every day for two
All energy funnels, all becomes you
'Cause you come from out of nowhere
My glance turns to a stare
One minute here and one minute there
Don't know if I'll laugh or cry
One minute here and one minute there
And it hurts inside
One minute here and one minute there
And then you wave good-bye...
