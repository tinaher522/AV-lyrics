<song artist="Faith_No_More" title="Superhero">
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go
Superhero
I'm tugging on your cape
Tell me will your sons
Know their father one day?
Leader of men
Leader of men
Get back in your cage
Will you be one of them?
Like an American drug
Makes a mean cock grow
Coward can kill a priest
Makes a superman of glass
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go
The S on your chest
You're feeling like a god
An order of animal
We try to find a rod
Superhero
Sensei, Nero
Smiling, hiding
Riding, flying
Sumo, sighing
Smiling, crying
Leader of men
Leader of men
Get back in your cage
Ain't no grave going to hold this body down
The sun rises here to save us now
It's all erased
Storybook years, sweet memories
Wash it away
Wash it away
Wash it away
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go
Go, go, go
Leader of men
Leader of men
Leader of men
Will you be one of them?
Leader of men
Leader of men
Leader of men
Will you be one of them?
Leader of men
Leader of men
Leader of men
Will you be one of them?
Leader of men
Leader of men
Leader of men
Will you be on of them?
Leader of men
Leader of men
Leader of men
Will you be on of them?
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go
Go, go, go
