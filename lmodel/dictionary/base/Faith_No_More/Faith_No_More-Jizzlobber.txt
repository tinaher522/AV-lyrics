<song artist="Faith_No_More" title="Jizzlobber">
They will sum it all up in a sentence
A verdict made harder to know
I'm ready to make a commitment
I'm willing to make love to concrete
Smiles
Bruises
Smiles
Bruises
Bars in the womb
I hide my dirty minutes under the dirty mattress and they are making me itch
My time is spilt milk
My skin is a layer of soot
I'm spending my days scrubbing
I'm trying so hard to act like nothing happened (no one left to blame, no one left to blame)
I'm trying so hard to find that fresh clean smell (no one left to blame, no one left to blame)
Smiles
Bruises
Smiles
Bruises
Bars in the womb
I hide my dirty minutes under the dirty mattress and they are making me itch
My time is spilt milk
Cruel words sleep above me
Mounting and teasing
I am what I do
I am what I've done
I'm sorry
Sorry
Sorry
Sorry
