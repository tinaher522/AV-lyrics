<song artist="Faith_No_More" title="What_A_Day">
A piece of mail, a letterhead
A piece of hair on a human head
They're sayin' to me
"I should've killed it"
"I should've killed it"
"I should've killed it"
"I should've killed it before"
You're right, you're right
Kill the body and the head will die
They're laughin' at me
"I should've learned it"
"I should've learned it"
"I should've learned it"
"I should've learned it"
"I should've learned it"
"I should've learned it before"
"I should've learned it before"
What a day, what a day
If you can look it in the face
And hold your vomit
What a day, what a day
If you can look it in the face
And hold your vomit
A wet sneeze and a "no left turn"
A row of teeth and an encouraging word
Beneath a mile of skin
I should've noticed it
I should've noticed it
A-noticed it before
Noticed it before
Noticed it before
Noticed it before
What a day, what a day
If you can look it in the face
And hold your vomit
What a day, what a day
If you can look it in the face
And hold your vomit
What a day, what a day
What a day, what a day
What a day, what a day
Don't you touch it
What a day
What a day
What a day
Don't you touch it
What a day
What a day
What a day
Don't you touch it
