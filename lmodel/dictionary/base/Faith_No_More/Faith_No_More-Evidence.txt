<song artist="Faith_No_More" title="Evidence">
If you want to open the hole
Just put your head down and go
Step beside the piece of circumstance
Got to wash away the taste of evidence
Wash it away
Evidence
Evidence
Evidence
Got a taste of evidence
I didn't feel a thing
You didn't mean a thing
Look in the eye and testify
It didn't feel a thing
Anything you say, we know you're guilty
Hands above your head and you won't even feel me
You won't feel me
I didn't feel a thing
I didn't feel a thing
It didn't mean a thing
Look in the eye and testify
I didn't feel a thing
Evidence
Evidence
Evidence
Got a taste of evidence
I didn't feel a thing
You didn't mean a thing
Look in the eye and testify
It didn't feel a thing
I didn't feel a thing
It didn't mean a thing
Look in the eye and testify
Didn't feel a thing
