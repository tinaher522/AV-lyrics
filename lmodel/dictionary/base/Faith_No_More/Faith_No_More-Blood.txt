<song artist="Faith_No_More" title="Blood">
Oh, oh
It doesn't really matter
The things you say to me
'Cause if I had a ladder
Up there is where I'd be
Outta here where the air is cold
You're messing with my mind, hey
You do it every time, hey
And the season comes around once more, once more
Oh, oh
Said it doesn't matter
The things you try to say
It doesn't really matter, you say 'em every day
Right now just give me more blood
Just give it to me deep red
A flowing river crimson
A flowing river burning with, with desire
It's great, but I never said how great, hey
Well, you never really asked, well
I'm asking you right now
So shut up and explain
What's on your mind in this dark hour
I said it doesn't matter
Oh
