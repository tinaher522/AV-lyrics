<song artist="Faith_No_More" title="New_Beginnings">
A freedom everywhere
A glow in her eye as he waved goodbye
That's where it all began
She was a loving girl, he was a caring guy
Together they had plans
They were married and had a baby
His name was Johnny
Wait a minute, that's me
Why am I only three years old again
Spinning and spinning and spinning
There was no gleam in your eye
When you passed us by in the parade this time
You had nothing to say
And you're always on your way somewhere
But today you just stood still
You were a quiet kind of person
Who asked for nothing and got just that
So they sent you away to kill for your country
Could you blame him?
Can you blame him? No
And in the end
When we meet again we're friends
Will we ever learn that we are only God's children
And God never made moral decisions
God made love
