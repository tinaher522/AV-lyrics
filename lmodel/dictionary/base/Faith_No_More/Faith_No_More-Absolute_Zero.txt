<song artist="Faith_No_More" title="Absolute_Zero">
Can we begin at the end
To save some time?
Dead center, point blank together
The clock is ticking, you have no authority here
Float like a dead man down the river
And there are no streets in this city
Et cetera is my worst enemy
It's low and I know that all will go
To the big hand of the goddamned
You're here
Red dots
And now you know where not to go
The middle ground is absolute zero
What can be found at absolute zero?
Can we begin at the end
To save some time?
Et cetera is my worst enemy
It's low and I know it all will go
To the big hand of the goddamned
The big hand of the bald man
The middle ground is absolute zero
What can be found at absolute zero?
A happy end is absolute zero
Nobody wins at absolute zero
Worse than nothing
Nothing...
