<song artist="Faith_No_More" title="I_Won't_Forget_You">
It only tickles now
I used to kick and shout
Now I just cling to the cloud
Footprint gone
You never love someone
Only what they leave behind
And I won't forget you
And I won't forget you
And I won't forget you
And I won't when I'm in hell
When I'm in hell
When I'm in hell
Hell
I'm taking all those things
The things that no one brings
The packing of those memories
And when I come up
The mountain of needles
And I swim in a lake of blood
No, no, no, no
And I won't forget you
And I won't forget you
I won't forget you
I won't forget you
I won't forget you
I won't forget you
I won't forget you
I won't forget you
I won't forget you
I won't forget you
