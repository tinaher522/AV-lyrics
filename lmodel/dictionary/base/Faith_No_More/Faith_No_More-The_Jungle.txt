<song artist="Faith_No_More" title="The_Jungle">
Well, just follow your heart, man oh man
Try and see, if you can, ha Ha
Jungle sounds great
Lots of scary noise
Don't deter us from our journey onward
Hey man, let your spirit go
To the full extent of the meaning
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
Hey man, let your spirit go
To the full extent of the meaning
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
He said,
"And follow me to the deepest part of the jungle
Where it is always dark and wet and warm
To the sacred part."
Well, just follow your heart, man oh man
Try and see, if you can, ha Ha
Jungle sounds great
Lots of scary noise
Don't deter us from our journey onward
We pushed and followed
Only our deepest, hidden senses, senses
And exposed to the elements
That lie within
Hey, hey, hey, hey
