<song artist="Faith_No_More" title="Spanish_Eyes">
Blue spanish eyes
Teardrops are falling from your Spanish eyes
Please, please don't cry
This is just adios and not goodbye
Soon I'll return
Bringing you all the love your heart can hold
Please say "Si, si"
Say you and your Spanish eyes will wait for me
Blue Spanish eyes
Prettiest eyes in all old Mexico
True Spanish eyes
Please smile at me once more before I go
Dear, I'll return
Bringing you all the love your heart can hold
Please say "Si, si"
Say you and your Spanish eyes will wait for me
Say you and your Spanish eyes will wait for me
