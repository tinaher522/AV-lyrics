<song artist="Faith_No_More" title="Home_Sick_Home">
Come home
It's been so long
We're missing you at home
So hang up that phone
'Cause I'm coming back home
Back home
Come home
It's been so long
Can't hide no more
So hang up that phone
'Cause I'm coming back home
Back home
Drive me home
Drive me home
Come home
It's been so long
We're missing you at home
So hang up that phone
'Cause I'm coming back home
(I'm coming home) Back home
(I'm coming back home) Back home
(I'm coming back home) I'm back home
