<song artist="Faith_No_More" title="Ugly_In_The_Morning">
You did one thing wrong
You woke up
You looked better before
More, more
And the stomach turns
Say nothing without wasting a word
I know exactly what you meant
I know how piggy feels
He starves without missing a meal
Look in the mirror
Don't look at me, I'm ugly in the morning
Don't look at me, I'm ugly in the morning
Don't look at me, I'm ugly in the morning
Don't look at me, I'm ugly in the morning
When the headache's gone
The sun is not
Forgot to turn the alarm
On, on
Doesn't matter how much you think
Or the number of hairs in the sink
I did it to myself again
I know how piggy feels
He starves without missing a meal
It's getting clearer
Don't look at me, I'm ugly in the morning
Don't look at me, I'm ugly in the morning
Don't look at me, I'm ugly in the morning
Don't look at me, I'm ugly in the morning
Don't look at me, I'm ugly in the morning
Don't look at me, I'm ugly in the morning
Don't look at me, I'm ugly in the morning
Don't look at me, I'm ugly in the morning
Don't look at me, I'm ugly in the morning
Don't look at me, I'm ugly in the morning
Don't look at me, I'm ugly in the morning
Don't look at me, I'm ugly in the morning
Don't look at me, I'm ugly in the morning
Don't look at me, I'm ugly in the morning
Don't look at me, I'm ugly in the morning
Don't look at me, I'm ugly in the morning
