We care a lot!
We care a lot!
We care a lot!
About disasters, fires, floods and killer bees
About the NASA shuttle fallin' in the sea
We care a lot!
About starvation and the food that Live Aid bought
We care a lot!
About disease, baby, rock, Hudson, rock!
Yeah!
Woo!
(Whoa, whoa) Oh, it's a dirty job but someone's gotta do it
Oh, it's a dirty job but someone's gotta do it
We care a lot!
We care a lot!
We care a lot!
About the gamblers and the pushers and the geeks
We care a lot!
About the smack and crack and whack that hits the street
We care a lot!
About the welfare of all you boys and girls
We care a lot!
About you people 'cause we're out to save the world!
Yeah!
Woo! Woo!
It's a dirty job but someone's gotta do it (Whoa, whoa)
Oh, it's a dirty job but someone's gotta do it
Said, it's a dirty job but someone's gotta do it
Oh, it's a dirty job but someone's gotta do it
Oh, it's a dirty job but someone's gotta do it (Whoa, whoa)
Oh, it's a dirty job but someone's gotta do it
Oh, it's a dirty job but someone's gotta do it
Said, it's a dirty job but someone's gotta do it
We care a lot!
About the army, navy, air force and marines
We care a lot!
About the NY-, SF-, and LAPD
We care a lot!
About you people
We care a lot!
About your guns
We care a lot!
About the wars we're fighting
Gee, that looks like fun!
We care a lot!
About the Garbage Pail Kids, they never lie
We care a lot!
About Transformers 'cause there's more than meets the eye
We care a lot!
About the little things the bigger things we top
We care a lot!
About you people, yeah you bet we care a lot!
Yeah!
Woo! Woo!
(Whoa, whoa)
Oh, it's a dirty job but someone's gotta do it
Oh, it's a dirty job but someone's gotta do it
(Whoa, whoa)
Said, it's a dirty job but someone's gotta do it
Well, it's a dirty job but someone's gotta do it
Said, it's a dirty job but someone's gotta do it
Oh, it's a dirty job but someone's gotta do it (Whoa, whoa)
Well, it's a dirty job but someone's gotta do it
Said, it's a dirty job but someone's gotta do it
Oh, it's a dirty song but someone's gotta sing it now
