<song artist="Faith_No_More" title="Kindergarten">
Return to my own vomit like a dog
Rhymes and giggles muffle the dialogue
Carve my initials in a tree I will never leave
Maybe one day I'll be royalty
Kingdom
Kindergarten
Born late
Will I graduate
Drinking fountains are shorter than they used to be
The swings on the playground don't even fit me anymore
Folklore: nobody's supposed to believe in the next grade
Write it a hundred times
Kingdom
Kindergarten
Waiting
Bells not ringing
Everything got quiet suddenly, no Dolby
The theatre is empty
Film is flapping on the side of the projector
The reel is over
Banished with my sticky shoes and stinging eyes
I'm walking outside
Kingdom
Kindergarten
Born late
Will I graduate
Held back again
