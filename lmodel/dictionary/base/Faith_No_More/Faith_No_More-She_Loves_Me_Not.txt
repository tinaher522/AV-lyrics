<song artist="Faith_No_More" title="She_Loves_Me_Not">
I'm here alone on the telephone line
I'm right where you want me to be
And I'll wait (here) to love (and) and never ask why
I'll be where you want me to be
And I know (and I know)
And I know (and I know)
And I know (and I know)
And I know, ooh
I've been here before and I know your kind
You're right where I want you to be
Now I'll say what I think
I'll never be what you want me to be
Just to be who I am
What you want me to be
(You'll be on your knees)
Tell me, tell me
Tell me it's not true
Tell me, tell me
Tell me it's not true
Tell me, tell me
Tell me it's not true
Tell me it's not true
And now I'm here alone on the telephone line
I'm right where you want me to be
And I know (and I know)
And I know, ooh (and I know)
And I know (and I know)
And I know, ooh
I wait (here) to love (and) and never ask why
I'll be where you want me to be
Now I'll say what I think
I'll never be what you want me to be
Just to be who I am
What you want me to be
(You'll be on your knees)
Tell me, tell me
Tell me it's not true
Tell me, tell me
Tell me it's not true
Tell me, tell me
Tell me it's not true
Tell me it's not true
Why don't you tell me
Tell me, tell me (tell me)
Tell me, tell me
Tell me it's not true
