<song artist="Faith_No_More" title="Hippie_Jam_Song">
To feel the heat of the summertime
I'm gonna find me a summer job 
To feel the heat of the summertime
I gotta find me a summer job
I'm in good hands, won't you change my bag
I need some help, won't you change my bag
Hellelujah and let's eat
Put some clothes on, wash those feet
Hellelujah and let's eat
Put some clothes on, put some clothes on
That's about as funny as a bake sale
That's about as deep as your pocket change
That's about as sour as a motorcade
That's about as thick as the hair on your back
That's about as easy as a communist
That's about as bony as your bony as your butt cheek
That's about as witty as a hot link
Hellelujah and let's eat
Put some clothes on, wash those feet
Hellelujah and let's eat
Put some clothes on, put some clothes on
Open this valve and change my bag
I need some help, won't you change my bag
I'm in good hands, won't you change my bag
You sweet young thing, won't you change my bag
Open this valve and change this bag
It's nice and warm, won't you change my bag
I'm in good hands, won't you change my bag
You gotta change my bag, you gotta change my bag
It's getting cold, won't you change my bag
