<song artist="Faith_No_More" title="Greed">
Over the hills, they came from the valley
Making innuendoes about my lack of talent
Oh well
Over the hills, they came from the valley
Making innuendoes about my lack of talent
Oh well
They say that when I'm supposed to be singing
All I 'm really doing is yelling
Oh well, to you I say
Break out or get out
Then they say that I can't sing
That I don't say a thing
That I make everything up
Oh well, to you I say
Break out or get out
Break out or get out
Get out of your mind
'Cause it's much too small
And there's so much going on
