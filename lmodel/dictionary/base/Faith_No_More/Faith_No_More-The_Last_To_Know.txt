<song artist="Faith_No_More" title="The_Last_To_Know">
Where it grows on trees, but never
Never blooms
Where it hurts the least for whoever
Saw it first
First to go and the last to know
Lasts longer than a lifetime
Takes the least amount of effort
Feels better than a bargain
Just to know it's there
First to go and the last to know
Can't you see there's only one me
And that me is me
I know where but I cannot share
You'll call me, I'll stand in line till then
I'll be waiting
Can't you see
All circuits are busy
Please try back again
