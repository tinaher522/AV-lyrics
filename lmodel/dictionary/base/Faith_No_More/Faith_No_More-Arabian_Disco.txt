<song artist="Faith_No_More" title="Arabian_Disco">
Has it been so long?
Do you think we know?
Do you think we care?
Die for the here and now
Do you remember why?
Do you remember how?
Just face out
Then stick back
Stick your chest out
Stomach in
That's right
Wooh
Do you really know?
Where the harems go?
In the desert snow?
Hail
An oasis dream
Doesn't really seem
To mean a thing
When you're out cold
So hands up
Put your guards up
Feet down
Up, down
Forward march
Left, right
Cold, cold, cold
I feel cold
