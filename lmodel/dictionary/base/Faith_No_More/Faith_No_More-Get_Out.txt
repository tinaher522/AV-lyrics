<song artist="Faith_No_More" title="Get_Out">
What if there's no more fun to have?
And all I've got is what I had?
What if I have forgotten how?
Cut my losses and get out now
Get out right now
There's something stronger than me
There's something I don't want to see
A new thing growing in me
It is the hardest thing to do
To watch it grow on top of you
And see you're just like everyone
No fun
There's something stronger than me
There's something I don't want to see
A new thing growing in me
There's something I don't want to see
I don't speak that language anymore
My blood is not that color anymore
My blood don't shine that same way anymore
I cannot deny it anymore, no
There's something stronger than me
There's something I don't want to see
A new thing growing in me
There's something I don't want to see
There's something stronger than me
There's something I don't want to see
A new thing growing in me
