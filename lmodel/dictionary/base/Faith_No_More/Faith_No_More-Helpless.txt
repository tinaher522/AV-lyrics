<song artist="Faith_No_More" title="Helpless">
The air is warm
I hear the wind and the trees
I know I'm there, but I'll never be
The wind is soft tonight
The tide is low
And I know the way
(I never felt better now)
Sometimes life, it moves too slow
Slows to a crawl, and then the poetry is lost
And without speed, hope becomes certainty
And for once I'm certain
(I never felt better now)
A garden is its own perfect world
Where everything has a place
Every leaf, every stone, every speck of dirt
But where's my place?
(I never felt better now)
I even tried to get arrested today
But everyone looked the other way
I count the hours and I count the days
And for once I'm certain
(I never felt better now)
Don't want your help
Don't need your help
Don't want your help
Don't need your help
Helpless
Helpless
(Helpless) You found a way to make me say
"Help me please someone."
(Helpless) You found a way to make me say
"Help me please someone."
The water's clear
I see that it's full of dimes
For every wish, I wonder why
Why all I want is something beautiful
A place to rest
(I never felt better now)
(I never felt better now)
Don't want your help
Don't need your help
Don't want your help
Don't need your help
You found a way to make me say
Help me please someone
You found a way to make me say
Help me please someone
(Helpless) You found a way to make me say
"Help me please someone."
(Helpless) You found a way to make me say
"Help me please someone."
(Helpless) You found a way, you found a way
You found a way
(Helpless) You found a way, you found a way
You found a way
Help
Help
Help
