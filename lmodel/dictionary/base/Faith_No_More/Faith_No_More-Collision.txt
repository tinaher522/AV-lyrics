Collision
My mission
When the dawn breaks
With a handshake
Relaxed and feelin' great
Screeching, head on, head on, head on
I'm needing a head on, a head on, a head on
Screeching, head on, head on, head on
I'm needing a head on, a head on, a head on
All the day's plans
All the shaking hands
Beepers and suntans
Screeching, head on, head on, head on
I'm needing a head on, a head on, a head on
Screeching, head on, head on, head on
I'm needing a head on, a head on, a head on
Collision
My mission
Head on
Head on
Head on
When the dawn breaks
With a handshake (head on, head on)
Relaxed and feelin' great
Collision
My mission (head on, head on, head on)
Collision
My mission (head on, head on, head on)
Head on
Head on
Head on
