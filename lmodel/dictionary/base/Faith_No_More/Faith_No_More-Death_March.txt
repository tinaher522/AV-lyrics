<song artist="Faith_No_More" title="Death_March">
Washington boulevard, eastbound
Thirty three
"Can I get a transfer man?
95 cents!!!! 
Fuck you, I'll skate to the beach!
And I'll look better gettin' there."
There's nothing I'd like more than to let you in
But now you're on the other side and there's no way
To feel your breath of life upon my face
'Cause with the state you're in there wouldn't be a trace
Now I wake up every night
With this emptiness inside
Hasn't been the same
Since you quit the human race, left without a trace
Quit the human race, did you?
Camina con la muerto?
Rosies rosies, pocket full of posies
Ashes ashes, we all fall down
Rosies rosies, pocket full of posies
Ashes ashes, we all fall down
Now I wake up every night
With this emptiness inside
Hasn't been the same
Since you quit the human race, left without a trace
Death march, baby!
Nothing you can do to stop me
