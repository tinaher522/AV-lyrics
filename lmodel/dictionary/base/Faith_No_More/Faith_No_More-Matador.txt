<song artist="Faith_No_More" title="Matador">
When lonesome came over me
A future shadow
Her ghost stood there, sang to me
Farewell, so long
I’ll awake you
From this living sleep
We’ll walk the shore
Where you were born
In bed with me
Although I cheat off your things
March forward, my son
A battle beyond frozen hills
Only for dawn's here
We will rise from the killing floor
Like a matador
The stained glass
Of bovine eyes
Can see right through
Every truth-soaked lie
Letters will trace every step
Out of this world 
And every ditch, every ditch
We will be where you will be no more
No more
The stained glass
Or the hangman’s ass
We served you well
Now we’re coming back
Out of the wake cross this ghost
We’ll jump the gates
And left to rise, we will rise
We will rise from the killing floor
Like a matador
And the dead live (ah)
May the dead live (ah)
And the dead live (ah)
What more can we give? (ah)
Let the dead live (ah)
May the dead live (ah)
And the dead live
The dead live (ah)
