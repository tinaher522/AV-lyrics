<song artist="Led_Zeppelin" title="Communication_Breakdown">
Hey, girl, stop what you're doin'
Hey, girl, you'll drive me to ruin
I don't know what it is I like about you, but I like it a lot
Won't you let me hold you, let me feel your lovin' touch
Communication breakdown, it's always the same
Havin' a nervous breakdown, will drive you insane
Hey, babe, I got somethin' I think you oughta know
Hey, babe, I wanna tell ya that I love you so
I wanna hold you in my arms, yeah
I'm never gonna let you go, 'cause I like your charm
Communication breakdown, it's always the same
Havin' a nervous breakdown, will drive you insane, oh, suck
Communication breakdown, it's always the same
Havin' a nervous breakdown, will drive you insane, yeah
Communicate, I want you to love me all night
I want you to love me all night, I want, hey, I want, yeah
I want you to love me, I want you to love, babe
I want you to love, yeah, I want you to love
Hey, I want you to love, yeah, I want you to
