<song artist="Led_Zeppelin" title="Over_The_Hills_And_Far_Away">
Hey, lady, you got the love I need
Maybe more than enough
Oh, darlin', darlin', darlin', walk a while with me
Oh, you've got so much, so much, so much
Many have I loved
And many times been bitten
And many times I've gazed
Along the open road
Many times I've lied
And many times I've listened
Many times I've wondered
How much there is to know
Many dreams come true
And some have silver linings
I live for my dream
And a pocketful of gold
Mellow is the man
Who knows what he's been missing
Many, many men
Can't see the open road
Many is a word
That only leaves you guessing
Guessing 'bout a thing
You really ought to know
Really ought to know
I really ought to know
You know I should, you know I should, you know I should
