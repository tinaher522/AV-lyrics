<song artist="Led_Zeppelin" title="I_Can't_Quit_You_Baby">
I-I, I can't quit you, babe
So I'm gonna put you down for a while
I said, I can't quit you, babe
I guess I got to put you down for a while
Said, you messed-up my happy home
Made me mistreat my only child
Yes, you did, babe, oh
Said, you know I love you, baby
My love for you I could never hide
Oh, you know I love you, babe
My love for you I could never hide
A-when I feel you near me, little girl
I know you are my one desire, whoa-oh, oh-oh, yeah
Oh, that's wonderful, whoa
Whoa
That's wonderful yeah!
When ya hear me moanin' and groanin', baby
You know it hurts me deep down inside
Oh, when ya hear me moanin' and groanin', babe
You know it hurts me deep down inside
Oh, a-when you hear me hollar, baby
You know you're my one desire, yes, you are, oh alright
