<song artist="Led_Zeppelin" title="Black_Dog">
Hey, hey, Mama, said, the way you move
Gonna make you sweat, gonna make you groove
Ah-ah, child, way you shake that thing
Gonna make you burn, gonna make you sting
Hey, hey, baby, when you walk that way
Watch your honey drip, can't keep away
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah
Ah, ah, ah
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah
Ah, ah, ah
I gotta roll, can't stand still
Got a flamin' heart, can't get my fill
Eyes that shine burnin' red
Dreams of you all through my head
Ah ah, ah ah, ah ah, ah ah
Ah ah, ah ah, ah
Hey, baby, whoah, baby, pretty baby
Darlin' can't you do me now?
Hey, baby, oh, baby, pretty baby
Move me while you do me now.
Didn't take too long 'fore I found out
What people mean by "down and out"
Spent my money, took my car
Started tellin' her friends she gonna be a star
I don't know, but I been told
A big-legged woman ain't got no soul
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah
Ah, ah, ah
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah
Ah, ah, ah (yeah)
All I ask for, all I pray
Steady loaded woman gonna come my way
Need a woman, gonna hold my hand
Will tell me no lies, make me a happy man
Ah ah, ah ah, ah ah, ah ah
Ah ah, ah ah, ah
Ah
(guitar solo)
La-da ah e ah yes I will And yes I really, really do baby,
baby, baby. I can really do you, huh? Ooh, wew, you do it
baby. Push it, baby, push it, baby, push it, baby, push it,
baby, push it baby, push it babe, babe. Ooh-ooh, aah-ooh, ooh.
I'd really like to do it now. I'd really like to it now.
