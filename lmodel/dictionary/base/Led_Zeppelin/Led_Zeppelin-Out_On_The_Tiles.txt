<song artist="Led_Zeppelin" title="Out_On_The_Tiles">
As I walk down the highway, all I do is sing a song
And a train that's passin' my way helps the rhythm move along
There is no doubt about, the words are clear
The voice is strong, it's oh, so strong
Just a simple guy, and live from day to day
A ray of sunshine melts my frown, blows my blues away
There's nothin' more that I can say
But on a day like today, I'll pass the time away
And walk a quiet mile with you
All I need from you is all your l-love
All you gotta give to me is all your love
All I need from you is all your love
All you gotta give to me is all your love
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah
I'm so glad I'm livin', (stop), gonna tell the world I am
I got me a fine woman and she says that I'm her man
A-one thing that I know for sure
Gonna give her all the lovin' like nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody can
Standin' in the noon-day sun tryin' to flag a ride
People go and people come, see my rider right by my side
It's a total disgrace, they set the pace
It must be race
The best thing I can do is run
All I need from you is all your love
All you gotta give to me, all your love
All I need from you is all your love
All you gotta give to me is all your love
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, hey
Aw, yeah, aw, yeah, aw, yeah
Oh, just remember said you'd be my one
All I really said was 'be my one'
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah
Ah-hah-hah-hah-hah-hah, yeah, yeah
Ah-hah-hah-hah-hah-hah-hah, yeah, yeah
