<song artist="Led_Zeppelin" title="No_Quarter">
Close the door, put out the light
Know they won't be home tonight
The snow falls hard and don't you know
The winds of Thor are blowing cold
They're wearing steel that's bright and true
They carry news that must get through
They choose the path where no one goes
They hold no quarter
They hold no quarter.
Walking side by side with death
The devil mocks their every step
The snow drives back the foot that's slow
The dogs of doom are howling more
They carry news that must get through
To build a dream for me and you
They choose the path that no one goes
They hold no quarter
They ask no quarter
They hold no quarter
They ask no quarter
(Ah, the pain without quarter)
They ask no quarter
(Ooh, yeah, when I'm callin', callin', callin')
They give no quarter, ah
The dogs of doom are howlin' more
Give me quarter
I hear the dogs of doom a-howlin' more...
