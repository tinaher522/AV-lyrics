<song artist="Led_Zeppelin" title="In_The_Light">
And if you feel that you can't go on
And your will's sinkin' low
Just believe and you can't go wrong
In the light, you will find the road (You will find the road)
Hey, ooh, did you ever believe that I could leave you
Standin' out in the cold?
Hey-yeah, baby, I know how it feels 'cause I have slipped through
To the very depths of my soul, yeah
Oh-whoa, baby, I just wanna show you what a clear view
There is from every bend in the road
Now, listen to me
Oh, whoa-whoa, as I was, believe it will be for you too, honey
As you would for me, aw, I will share your load
Let me share your load, ooh, let me share, a-share your load
And if you feel that you can't go on
In the light, you will find the road
Hey, oh-ho, the winds of change may blow 'round you
But that will always be so
Oh, a-whoa-whoa, whoa-whoa, when love is pain, it can devour you
But you are never alone
I will share your load
I will share your load, baby, let me, oh, let me
In the light
Everybody needs a light, woo, yeah-yeah
Ooh, baby, everybody, everybody, everybody
Sure 'nuff they do
Light, light, light, in the light
Light, light, light, in the light, ooh, yeah
Light, light, light, in the light
Light, light, light, in the light
Light, light, light, in the light, woo, yeah-yeah
Light, light, light, in the light
Everybody come on, now
