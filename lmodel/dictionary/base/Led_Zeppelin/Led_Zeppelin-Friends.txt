<song artist="Led_Zeppelin" title="Friends">
Bright light, almost blindin'
Black night still there shinin'
I can't stop, keep on climbin'
Lookin' for what I knew
Had a friend, she once told me
"You got a love, you ain't lonely"
Now she's gone and left me only
Lookin' for what I knew
Mm, I'm tellin' you, now
The greatest thing you ever can do, now
Is trade a smile with someone who's blue now
It's very easy, just-a
Met a man on the roadside cryin'
Without a friend, there's no denyin'
You're incomplete, there'll be no findin'
Lookin' for what you knew
So anytime somebody needs ya
Don't let 'em down, although it grieves ya
Someday you'll need someone like they do
Lookin' for what you knew
Mm, mm, I'm tellin' you, now
The greatest thing you ever can do, now
Is trade a smile with someone who's blue, now
It's very easy, just-a, oh, yeah
Ah, nah, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, yeah
I'm tellin' you, now
The greatest thing you ever can do, now
Is trade a smile with someone who's blue, now
It's very easy, it's very easy
It's very easy, it's easy, easy, yeah, yeah, yeah
