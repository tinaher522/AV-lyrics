<song artist="Led_Zeppelin" title="Dazed_And_Confused">
Been dazed and confused for so long, it's not true
Wanted a woman, never bargained for you
Lotsa people talkin', few of them know
Soul of a woman was created below, yeah
You hurt and abuse, tellin' all of your lies
Run 'round, sweet baby, lord, how they hypnotize
Sweet little baby, I don't know where you been
Gonna love you, baby, here I come again
Every day I work so hard, bringin' home my hard-earned pay
Try to love you, baby, but you push me away
Don't know where you're goin', only know just where you've been
Sweet little baby, I want you again
(That's not my babe)
Ah, ah, ah, ah
(Did you ever look up my woman)
Ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah
Ahh, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ahhh, ahh
Oh, yeah, alright, alright
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Oh, I don't like when you're mystifyin' me
Oh, don't leave me so confused, now
Whoa, baby
Been dazed and confused for so long, it's not true
Wanted a woman, never bargained for you
Take it easy, baby, let them say what they will
Tongue wag so much when I send you the bill, oh, yeah, alright
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ah, ah, ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
