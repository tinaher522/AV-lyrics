<song artist="Led_Zeppelin" title="Thank_You">
If the sun refused to shine, I would still be loving you
When mountains crumble to the sea
There will still be you and me
Kind woman, I give you my all, kind woman, nothing more
Little drops of rain whisper of the pain
Tears of loves lost in the days gone by
My love is strong, with you there is no wrong
Together we shall go until we die, my, my, my
An inspiration's what you are to me, inspiration, look, see
And so today, my world, it smiles
Your hand in mine, we walk the miles
But thanks to you, it will be done
For you to me are the only one, alright, yeah
Happiness, no more be sad, happiness, I'm glad
If the sun refused to shine, I would still be lovin' you
Mountains crumble to the sea, there will still be you and me
