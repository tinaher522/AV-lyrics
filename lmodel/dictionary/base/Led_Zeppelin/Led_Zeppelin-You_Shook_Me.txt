<song artist="Led_Zeppelin" title="You_Shook_Me">
You know you shook me, you shook me all night long
You know you shook me baby, you shook me all night long
You shook me so hard baby, baby, baby, please come home
I have a bird that whistles, and I have birds that sing
I have a bird that whistles, and I have birds that sing
Ha-ha-ha, I have a bird won't do nothin', aah-ah, oh-whoa
Buy a diamond ring, yeah
