<song artist="Led_Zeppelin" title="When_The_Levee_Breaks">
If it keeps on rainin', levee's going to break
If it keeps on rainin', levee's going to break
And when the levee breaks, have no place to stay
Mean old levee, taught me to weep and moan, moan
Mean old levee, taught me to weep and moan
It's got what it takes to make a mountain man leave his home
Oh, well, oh, well, oh, well-a, ooh-ooh
A-don't it make ya feel bad
When you're tryin' to find your way home?
You don't know which way to go
If you're goin' down south and there's no work to do
Then ya go north to Chicago, ah, ah, ah, hey
Cryin' won't help ya, prayin' won't do ya no good, no
Cryin' won't help ya, prayin' won't do ya no good
A-when the levee breaks, mama, you got to move, a-woo-hoo
All last night, I sat on the levee and moaned
All last night, sat on the levee and moaned
Thinkin' 'bout my baby and my happy home, oh-hoh
Goin', I'm goin' to Chicago, goin' to Chicago
Sorry, but I can't take you
Goin' down, goin' down, now, goin' down, a-goin' down, now
Goin' down, goin' down, goin' down, goin' down, yeahh
Goin' down, goin' down, now, goin' down, goin' down, now
Goin' down, goin' down, now, goin' down
Goin' down, down, down, down, down
