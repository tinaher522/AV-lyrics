<song artist="Led_Zeppelin" title="Walter's_Walk">
Ooh, know I feel's so strange lookin' at the door
Ah-oh, tryin' hard to change and can't let go
Oh, cryin' tears of pain hurtin' more an' more
Oh, every day's the same as you walk the floor.
I'm walkin' the floor over you
I'm walkin' the floor.
Every heart that breaks is a heart that's cold
Oh, to the hand that takes your dreamless soul
Ah, is it long to wait, is there much to pay?
Oh-ah, sometimes it's hard waitin' the day.
You know, it's hard, I said it's hard, you know, it's true
I said it's hard, you know, it's hard, still know it's true.
Every tear that falls is a smile that's lost.
When you hear the call, can you count the cost?
And you stand alone, do you wonder how?
Can you step aside; does it matter now?
Every love that's changed (every love that's changed)
Spend it fully (spend it fully)
In the eyes of the night (in the eyes of the night),
Was it hard to see (was it hard to see)?
If it never fails (if it never), in spite of it all (all),
So you hide in the tears, enter Walter's walk.
Know it's true now
You know, it's true now, woo, yeah.
I'm walkin' the floor over you
I'm walking the floor.
Every tear that falls is a smile that's lost.
When ya hear the call, can you count the cost?
As you stand alone, do you wonder how?
Can you step aside? Does it matter now?
Does it matter now?
Does it?
Now does it matter?
Now does it matter?
Ooh, yeah!
Ooh, yeah!
Ooh, little baby, don't you know?
Every tear that falls, does it matter now?
Does it matter now? Oh, yeah!
Oh, yeah! Oh, yes! Oh, yes!
