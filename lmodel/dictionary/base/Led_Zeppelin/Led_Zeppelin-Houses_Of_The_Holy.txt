<song artist="Led_Zeppelin" title="Houses_Of_The_Holy">
Let me take you to the movie
Can I take you to the show?
Let me be yours ever truly
Can I make your garden grow?
From the houses of the holy
We can watch the white doves go
From the door comes Satan's daughter
And it only goes to show
And you know
There's an angel on my shoulder
In my hand, a sword of gold
Let me wander in your garden
And the seeds of love I'll sow
You know
So the world is spinnin' faster
Are you dizzy when you stall?
Let the music be your master
Will ya heed the master's call?
Oh-whoa, save me, man
Said, there ain't no use in crying
'Cause it will only, only drive you mad
Does it hurt to hear them lying?
Was this the only world you had? Oh-whoa
So let me take ya, take ya to the movies
Can I take ya, baby, to the show?
Why don'tcha let me be yours ever truly?
Can I make your garden grow?
And you know, that's right
