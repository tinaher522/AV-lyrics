<song artist="Led_Zeppelin" title="Hots_On_For_Nowhere">
I was burned in the heat of the moment
No, it coulda been the heat of the day
When I learned how my time had been wasted,
Dear fellows, I turned away.
Now I've got friends who will give me their shoulder
When I should happen to fall
The timing is right growin' older
I've got friends who will give me fuck fall.
La la la la la la, yeah,
La la la la la na na, my baby
La la la la la la, yeah,
La la la la la la.
The corner of Bleeker and nowhere
In the land of not quite day
A shiver runs down my backbone
Face in the mirror turns grey.
So I looked 'round to hitch up the reindeer
Searching hard trying to brighten the day
I turned around to look for the snowman
To my surprise he'd melted away, yeah.
La la la la la la, yeah,
La la la la la na na, my baby
La la la la la la, yeah,
La la la la la la.
As the moon and the stars call the order
Inside my tides dance the ebb and sway
The sun in my soul's sinking lower
While the hope in my hands turns to clay.
I don't ask that my field's full of clover
I don't moan at opportunity's door
And if you ask my advice, take it slower
Then your story'd be your finest reward.
La la la la la la, yeah,
La la la la la na na, my baby
La la la la la la, yeah,
La la la la la la
Now do it.
Lost on the path to attainment
Search in the eyes of the wise
When I bled from the heart of the matter
I started bleeding without a disguise.
Now everything's fine under heaven
Now and then you've got to take time to pause
When you're down on the ground, don't be messin' around
You can land in a boat without oars.
La la la la la la, yeah,
La la la la la na na, my baby
La la la la la la, yeah,
La la la la la la.
Hey, babe, oh, hey, babe, oh, hey, babe,
I lost my way.
Hey, babe, oh, hey, babe, oh,
I really, really did.
Hey, babe, oh, hey, babe, oh,
I don't know where I'm gonna find it.
Hey, babe, oh, hey, babe, oh,
Do you wanna know?
Do you really, really wanna help me, yeah?
Let me tell you now, babe
Oh, let me tell you, oh
That it feels so good, that it must be right.
Come on, babe
Oh, let me tell you
If it feels so good, then it must be right.
Come on, babe
Oh, let me tell you, oh
If it feels, if it feels, if it feels, if it feels
So good, oh, so good, oh, so good
Oh, yes.
