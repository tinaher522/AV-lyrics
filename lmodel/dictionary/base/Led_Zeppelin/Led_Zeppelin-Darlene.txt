Oh, yeah!
A-Darlene
Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, Darlene
Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, Darlene
Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah!
Darlene
Oh-oh, Darlene
Oh-oh-oh, Darlene
Ooh-ooh-ooh
C'mon, baby, give a me, me some.
When I see you at that dance
With your tight dress on
What you got, it sure is fine
I wanna get me some.
Darlene
Ooh, baby, baby, Darlene
Ah, be my baby, Darlene
Oh, come on, baby
Come on, come on, come on, my babe.
Darlene
Ooh, ooh, Darlene
Hey, hey, Darlene
Oh, oh,
Come back 'n' be my, mmm, sweet little girl.
When I see you on the street
It makes my heart go flitter
I see you walkin' with all those guys
It makes me feel so sick.
Now I don't care what people say
And I don't care what they do
Sweet child, I gotta make you mine
You're the only thing that I want: you, yeah.
And, baby, baby, when you walk down the block
See the people fight
Whoa, child, y'know ya drive me wild
I gotta do it with you, come on try.
Ooh, baby, I got my car
I'll take you where it's fine
I'm gonna take you every place
D'ya wanna boogie-woogie-woogie-woogie-woogie that's fine?
I'm gonna boogie, Darlene
I'm gonna make ya, my girl
I'm gonna boogie, ah, Darlene
I'm gonna send you in another world.
'Cause I love, ah, Darlene
And I love you, yes, I do
I've been savin' all my money
I've been workin' all day long
I gotta give it all back to you.
Oh, but I love you, Darlene
Yes, I love you, yes, I do
I've been workin', it's true
I've been workin' every day
I've been tryin' a-get it home to you.
And I love you, Darlene
Yes, I love you, I do
I got a pink carnation and a pickup truck
A-savin' it all for you.
Oh, I love you!
Go!
Go, go, go, go, go!
Oh...
