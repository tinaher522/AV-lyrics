<song artist="Led_Zeppelin" title="We're_Gonna_Groove">
See my baby comin' down the track
Mm-betcha my baby's comin' back
Someday she get back to me
Whoa, and we gonna raise a family.
We're gonna groove, yeah, groove
And we're gonna groove, whoa
Well, my baby, we're gonna love, love, love
Until the break of day.
Sweet as sweet as sweet can be
You don't know what you do to me
A-let me say you're my one desire
You just set my soul on fire.
And we're gonna groove, a-yeah, groove
And we're gonna groove, baby, babe, baby
We're gonna love, a-love, love, love
Until the break of day.
Sweet as sweet as sweet can be
Lemme tell ya, you don't know whatcha do to me
A-you just set my soul on fire
A-woman, you know you're my one desire,
My one desire, my one.
We're gonna groove
Whoa, we gonna groove
We're gonna groove, yeah
And we're gonna love, love, love
Until the break of day.
We're gonna groove, yeah, groove,
And we're gonna groove
A-lonely, mama, yeah.
