<song artist="Led_Zeppelin" title="Immigrant_Song_(BBC)">
Ah-ah-ahhhh-ah, ah-ah-ahhhh-ah
We come from the land of the ice and snow
From the midnight sun where the hot springs blow
Hammer of the gods
Will drive our ships to new lands
To fight the horde, sing and cry
Valhalla, I am coming, yeah
On we sweep with threshing oar
Our only goal will be the western shore
Ah-ah-ahhhh-ah, ah-ah-ahhhh-ah
We come from the land of the ice and snow
From the midnight sun where the hot springs blow
How soft your fields so green
Whispered tales of gore
Of how we calmed the tides of war
Baby baby, ho-o-h-ohh, overlords
On we sweep with threshing oar
Our only goal will be the western shore
So now you'd better stop and rebuild all your ruins
For peace and trust can win the day
Despite all your losing
