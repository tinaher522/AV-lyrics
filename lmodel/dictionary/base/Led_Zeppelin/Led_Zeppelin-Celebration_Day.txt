<song artist="Led_Zeppelin" title="Celebration_Day">
Her face is cracked from smiling,
All the fears that she's been hiding
And it seems that pretty soon
Everybody's gonna know.
And her voice is sore from shouting,
Cheering winners who are losing
And she worries if their days are few
And soon they'll have to go.
My my my, I'm so happy
I'm gonna join the band
We gonna dance and sing in celebration
We're in the promised land.
She hears them talk of new ways
To protect the home she lives in
Then she wonders what it's all about
When they break down the door.
Her name is Brown or White or Black,
You know her very well
You hear her cries of mercy
As the winners toll the bell.
My my my, I'm so happy
I'm gonna join the band
We gonna dance and sing in celebration
We're in the promised land.
There is a train that leaves the station,
Heading for your destination
But the price you pay to nowhere
Has increased a dollar more
Yes, it has!
And if you walk, you're gonna get there,
Although it takes a little longer
When you see it in the distance
You will wring your hands and moan.
Oh, yeah, oh, moan
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, moan.
Come on, get down, get down, get down, yeah
Get down
Ma ma ma ma ma ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, you are gone
You are gone, you're gone, yeah.
And if you walk, you're gonna get there,
Tho' it takes a little longer
And when you see 'em in the distance
You will wring your hands and moan...
