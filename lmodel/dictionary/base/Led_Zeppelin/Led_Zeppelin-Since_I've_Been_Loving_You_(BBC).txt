<song artist="Led_Zeppelin" title="Since_I've_Been_Loving_You_(BBC)">
've been workin' from seven to eleven ev'ry night
It really makes life a drag
I don't think that's right, no
I've really been the best of fools, la-ee-ah
I did what I could, yeah
How I love you, baby
How I love you
Mama love you
Yes, I love you, little girl, ahhhh
But baby, since I've been loving you now
I'm about to lose my worried mind, ohhh yeah
Ev'ry-eh-eh-everybody trying to tell me
You didn't mean me no good
I said I've tried, I said I've tried, I said I've tried
To do the best, the very best I could
And I've been workin', I've been workn'
I don't think you realize, ohh-ooh-ohh, ohh-ooh-ohh
I've been workin' every day
Take my pain away now
Baby baby, since I've been loving you
I'm about to lose my worried mind, that's right
Oh baby, I've been crying
Baby come on home
Baby, hey hey hey, yeah
Don't you hear
Don't you hear them calling
Don't you hear
Don't you hear them calling
Do you remember, baby, oh baby, you knocked upon my door
I said you had the nerve, you had the nerve, you had the nerve to tell me
You didn't want me, you didn't want me no more, ooh yeah
Out my front door, I hear my back door slam
Baby baby, I must have one of them new fangled back door mans,
ohh-ooh-ohh, ohh-ooh-ohh, yeah baby
Baby, since I've been loving you
I'm about to lose, ma, my worried mind, well
One more time now
Oh yeah-ee-yeah, oh baby, oh baby, oh baby
I'm about to lose my mind, mind, mind, oh
