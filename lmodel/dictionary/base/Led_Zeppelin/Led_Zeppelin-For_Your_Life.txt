<song artist="Led_Zeppelin" title="For_Your_Life">
Well, well.
Oh, hoh, hoh
You said I was the only
With my lemon in your hand
Uh-oh, uh-oh-hoh
Exhibition is your habit,
Emotion second-hand
Uh-oh, uh-oh
Had to pull away to save me,
Well, maybe next time around-a, oh.
And she said,
"Don'tcha want, a-don'tcha wanna cook it, cook it, cook it?"
Hadn't planned to, could not stand'a try it, fry it, ow
Now, now, now, now, yeah.
Wooo-oooh-oooh-oooh-ooh-ooh
Heard a cry for mercy, uh,
In the city of the damned-a
Uh-oh, baby, damn...
In the pits you go no lower,
The next stop's underground
Oh, "Hello underground."
Your wine and roses ain't quite over,
Fate deals a losing hand.
And I said,
"Didn't mean to, did not a-mean to fluff it
You didn't plan it, you overran it, aah-ha-ha-how, yeah."
Do you wanna, do you want, do ya, d-do
Do you, would you wanna?
Do you wanna, do you wanna, do you, d-do
Do you, would you wanna?
When you blow it, babe,
You got to blow it right
Baby, if you fake it, mama,
Baby, fake with all your might
When you fake it, mama
Please-a, a-fake it right for yourself, babe
When ya fa-fa-fa-fake it, baby
You're fakin' it for your life, for your life,
For your life, for your life.
Do you, do you, do you, do you, do you
Do you, would you wanna?
Do you, do you, do you, do you, do you
Do you, would you wanna?
Oh, like to help ya, baby
But I don't know what to do-ooh-ooh, yeah
Sometime, baby
Nothin' I can do-ooh-ooh, yeah.
On the balance of a crystal, 
Payin' through the nose
And when they couldn't resist ya
I said, "Just go with the flow."
And now your stage is empty
Pull down the curtain, baby, please
Fold up your show.
Hadn't planned to, could not stand to fry in it
I hadn't planned it, I overran it
Fry it for your life, for your life.
