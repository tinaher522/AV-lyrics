<song artist="Led_Zeppelin" title="Down_By_The_Seaside">
Down by the seaside, see the boats go sailin'
A-can the people hear, oh, what the little fish are sayin'?
Aaah, ah-ah-ah-ah
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Oh, oh, people turned away, oh, the people turned away
Down in the city streets, see all the folk go racin', racin'
No time left, no, no, to pass the time of day in
Aaah, ah-ah-ah-ah
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Yay, yay, yeah, aw, the people turned away, people turned away, so far away, so far away
See how they run, see how they run
See how they run, see how they run
Run run run, run run run, run run run
Do you still do the twist?
Do you find that you remember things that well?
I wanna tell you, some go twistin' every day
Though sometimes it's awful hard to tell
Ah-hah, ah-hah, ah-hah, oh
Out in the country, hear the people singin'
Singin' 'bout the growin', knowin' where they're goin', yeah, yeah, they know, yeah, they know
Aaah, ah-ah-ah-ah
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, people turned away, yeah, the people turned away
Sing loud for the sunshine
Pray hard for the rain
And show your love for Lady Nature
And she will come back again
Yes she will, yes, she will
Aaah, ah-ah-ah-ah
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Oh, oh, oh, people turned away, the people turned away
Don't they know that they're goin'
