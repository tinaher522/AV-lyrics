<song artist="Led_Zeppelin" title="Dancing_Days">
Dancing days are here again
Summer evenings grow
I've got my flower, I've got my power
I've got a woman who knows
I said it's alright, you know, it's alright
I guess it's all in my heart
You'll be my only, my one and only
Is that the way it should start
Crazy ways are evident
In the way you're wearing your clothes
Sippin' booze is precedent
As the evening starts to glow
You know, it's alright, I said it's alright
You know, it's all in my heart
You'll be my only, my one and only
Is that the way it should start
Dig
You told your mama I'd get you home
But you didn't say I got no car
I saw a lion, he was standing alone
With a tadpole in a jar
You know, it's alright, I said it's alright
I guess it's all in my heart, heart, heart
You'll be my only, my one and only
Is that the way it should start
So dancing days are here again
As the summer evenings grow
You are my flower, you are my power
You are my woman who knows
I said it's alright, you know, it's alright
I know it's all in my heart
You'll be my only, yes, my one and only
Yes, is that the way it should start
I know it is, yeah
