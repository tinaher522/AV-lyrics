<song artist="Led_Zeppelin" title="Kashmir">
Oh, let the sun beat down upon my face
With stars to fill my dream
I am a traveler of both time and space to be where I have been
To sit with elders of a gentle race this world has seldom seen
Who talk of days for which they sit and wait
When all will be revealed
Talk and song from tongues of lilting grace
Sounds caress my ear
Though not a word I heard could I relate
The story was quite clear, whoa-oh-hoh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Oooh, oh, baby, I've been flyin' No, yeah  
Mama cares, ain't no denyin'
Oh, oooh yes, I've been flyin'
My mama, ain't no denyin', no denyin', no
Oh, all I see turns to brown as the sun burns the ground
And my eyes fill with sand as I scan this wasted land
Tryin' to find, tryin' to find where I've been, ah-ah, ah-ah
Oh, pilot of the storm who leaves no trace
Like thoughts inside a dream
Who hid the path that led me to that place
With yellow desert screen
My Shangri-La beneath the summer moon, I will return again
Sure as the dust that blows high in June
When movin' through Kashmir
Oh, father of the four winds, fill my sails
Across the sea of years
With no provision but an open face along the straits of fear
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh-hoh, oh, ohh
Whoa, when I'm on, when I'm on my way, yeah
When I see, when I see the way you stay, yeah-eah
Ooh, yeah-yeah, ooh, yeah-yeah, when I'm down, oh
Ooh, yeah-yeah, ooh, yeah-yeah, when I'm down, so down
Ooh, my baby, ooh, my baby, let me take you there
Oh, oh, come on, come on, oh, let me take you there
Let me take you there, woo, yeah-yeah, woo, yeah-yeah
Let me take you there, let me take you there
