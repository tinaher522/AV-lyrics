<song artist="Led_Zeppelin" title="Your_Time_Is_Gonna_Come">
Lyin', cheatin', hurtin', that's all you seem to do
Messin' around, every guy in town
Puttin' me down for thinkin' of someone new
Always the same, playin' your game
Drive me insane, trouble's gonna come to you
One of these days, and it won't be long
You'll look for me, but, baby, I'll be gone
This is all I gotta say to ya, woman
Your time is gonna come, your time is gonna come
Your time is gonna come, your time is gonna come
Made up my mind, break you this time
Won't be so fine, it's my turn to cry
Do what you want, I won't take the brunt
It's fadin' away, can't feel you anymore
Don't care what you say, 'cause I'm goin' away to stay
Gonna make you pay for that great big hole in my heart
People talkin' all around
Watch out, woman, no longer is the joke gonna be on my heart
You been bad to me, woman, but it's comin' back home to you
Your time is gonna come, your time is gonna come
Your time is gonna come, your time is gonna come
Your time is gonna come, bye, bye-bye, baby
Your time is gonna come, Bye, bye. Bye, bye.
Your time is gonna come, See you my babe.
Your time is gonna come, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Your time is gonna come, Bye, bye. Bye, bye. Bye, bye.
Your time is gonna come, I gotta get away from here.
Your time is gonna come, goodbye, my baby
Your time
