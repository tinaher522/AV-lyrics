Shall we roll it, Jimmy?
We're rolling on, uh -- what, one? No.
One again.
I'm tryin' to get this airplane off.
Nah, leave it, yeah.
Hey, hey, mama, what's the matter here?
Hey, hey, mama, what's the matter here?
You didn't have to tell me that ya love me so
You didn't have to love me, mama, let me go
Hey, hey, mama, what's the matter here
You didn't have to make me a total disgrace
You didn't have to leave me with that beer in my face
Hey, hey, mama, what's the matter here?
Uh, that's alright, it's awful doggone clear
Hey, hey, baby, why you treat me mean?
Oh, oh, baby, why you treat me mean?
You didn't have to crucify me like you did
You didn't have to tell me I was just your kid
Hey, hey, mama, why'd you treat me mean?
You didn't have to say you'd always be by my side
You didn't have to tell me you'd be my blushin' bride
Hey, hey, mama, why you treat me mean?
But that's alright, I know your sisters too
You didn't have to tell me that ya love me so
You didn't have to leave me, mama, let me go
Hey, hey, mama, what is wrong with you?
You didn't have to leave me like a total disgrace
You didn't have to leave me with that beer on my face
Hey, hey, mama, what is wrong with you?
Oh, but that's alright, I'd be the same way too
Oh, yeah-yo
Go, man, go
Now, my baby, now, you didn't have to crucify me like you did
You didn't have to tell me I was just your kid
Hey, hey, mama, what's the matter here?
You didn't have to tell me you would be my own
You didn't have to tell me, "Baby, let me go"
Hey, hey, mama, what is wrong with you?
Ah, that's alright, I know your sister too
Oh, yeah-yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah-yeah
Ooh, yeah-yeah, ooh, yeah, oh
What's the matter with you, mama?
