And if I say to you tomorrow
Take my hand, child, come with me
It's to a castle I will take you
Well, what's to be they say will be
Catch the wind, see us spin
Sail away, leave the day
Way up high in the sky
And whoa, but the wind won't blow
You really shouldn't go
It only goes to show
That you will be mine
By takin' our time, ooohh, oh
And if you say to me tomorrow
Oh, what fun it all will be
Then what's to stop us, pretty baby
But what is and what should never be
A-catch the wind, see us spin
Sail away, leave the day
Way up high in the sky
And whoa, but the wind won't blow
You really shouldn't go
It only goes to show
That you will be mine
By takin' our time, ooohh

...leave the day
Way up high in the sky
But the wind won't blow
You really shouldn't go
It only goes to show
That you will be mine
By takin' our time
So, if you wake up with the sunrise
And all your dreams are still as new
And happiness is what you need so bad
Girl, it's a loss in you, yeah
Catch the wind, see us spin
Sail away, leave the day
Way up high in the sky
And whoa, but the wind won't blow
You really shouldn't go
It only goes to show
That you will be mine
By takin' our time, ooohh
But the wind won't blow and we really shouldn't go
and it only goes to show, whoa ooh whoa ohh ohh
Ma-sh-eah, oh
But they never gonna who's gonna cool out, yeah
Oh ohhhhh, yeah
Mama do, mama ma-do, ohh
Mama mama mama, yeah
