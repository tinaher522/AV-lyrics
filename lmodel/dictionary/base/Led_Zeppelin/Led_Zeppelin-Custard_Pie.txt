<song artist="Led_Zeppelin" title="Custard_Pie">
Ooh yeah, drop down, baby
Let daddy see, yeah
Drop down my way
Miss treat for me
Well, my mama allow me
I fool 'round all night long
Well, I may look like I'm crazy
I sure know right from wrong
See me comin', throw your man outdoors
Ain't no stranger, done been this way before
See me comin', mama, a-throw your man outdoors
I ain't no stranger, I've been this way before
Put on your nightshirt and your mornin' gown
You know by night, I'm gonna shake 'em on down
Put on your nightshirt, mama, and your mornin' gown
Well, you know, by night I'm sure gonna shake 'em on down
Shake it, shake it
Ooh, your custard pie, yeah, sweet and nice
When you cut it, mama, save me a slice
Your custard pie, yeah
I declare it's sweet and nice
I like your custard pie
When you cut it, mama, mama, please save me a slice
Oh, I'll chew on a piece of your custard pie
I'll chew on a piece of your custard pie
I'll chew on a piece of your custard pie
I'll chew on a piece of your custard pie
Drop down, drop down, drop down, drop down
Drop down, yeah
Drop down, drop down
I'll chew on a piece of your custard pie
