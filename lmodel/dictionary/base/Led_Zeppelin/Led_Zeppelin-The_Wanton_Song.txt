<song artist="Led_Zeppelin" title="The_Wanton_Song">
Siren moving in the night came
Took my seed from my shakin' frame
Same old fire, another flame
And the wheel rolls on
Siren moving, it's from the flames you come
From the deep behind the sun
Kissed my fire, yes, my lovin' gun
Left me barely holdin' on, oh, oh
Blazin' eyes see my tremblin' hand
When we know the time has come
Ooh, blinded senses lose command
Feel your heathen rivers run
Is it every time I fall
That I think this is the one
Ooh, in the darkness can you hear me call?
Another day has just begun, another day, yeah
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Saw you woman, how you faced this change
Some know the way it's become
Feel my fire needs a brand new fling
And the wheel rolls on, rolls on, rolls on, rolls on, yeah
Ooh-ooh-oh
