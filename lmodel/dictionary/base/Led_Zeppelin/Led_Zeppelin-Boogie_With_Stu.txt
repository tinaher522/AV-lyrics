<song artist="Led_Zeppelin" title="Boogie_With_Stu">
Playin' in town, my baby
We just gotta rock on
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, darlin'
We just gotta go home
I don't want no tutti-fruitti, no lollipop
A-come on, baby, just rock, rock, rock
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, honey
We've been shakin' all night
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, darlin'
We just gotta roll right
Ahh-ah-ah-ah, ooh, my head, rock on, rock on
Play it, yeah
Hey babe, hey babe
Hey babe, hey babe
Hey babe, hey babe
Hey babe, hey babe
I don't want no tutti-fruitti, no lollipop
Well, come on, baby, just rock, rock, rock
Woo-hoo, woo-hoo
Ooh-hoo, ooh-hoo
Ooh-hoo, ooh-hoo
Ooh-hoo, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-hoo, ooh-ooh-hoo, ooh-ooh-hoo, ooh-ooh-hoo
Ooh-hoo, let's go out
Woo-hoo, ooh-hoo
Ooh-hoo, hoo-hoo
Woo-hoo, hoo-hoo
I don't want no tutti-fruitti, no lollipop
Ah, come on, baby, just rock, rock, yeah
