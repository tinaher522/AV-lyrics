<song artist="Led_Zeppelin" title="The_Song_Remains_The_Same">
I had a dream, oh, now, crazy dream, ohh-ohh
Anything I wanted to know, any place I needed to go
Hear my song, now, people, don't ya listen, now
Sing along, oh, you don't know what you're missin', now
Any little song that you know
Everything that's small has to grow
And so it grows, yeah, push, push, yeah-ah
Na-na-na-na-na-ah-ah
California sunlight
Sweet Calcutta rain
Honolulu starbright
The song remains the same
Ooh-ooh Ooh-ooh-hohh-ohh, 
Head-on
Ah
Keep on
All you got to do, all the night
All you, all you gotta do now, all you gotta do now, ooh with me
Sing out Hare, Hare
Ooh, dance the Hoochie-Koo
City lights are oh, so bright as we go slidin', slidin'
Slidin', slidin', slidin' slidin' slidin' slidin'
Slidin-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah on.
