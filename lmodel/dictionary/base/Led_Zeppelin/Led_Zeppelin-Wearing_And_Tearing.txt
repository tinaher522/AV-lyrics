<song artist="Led_Zeppelin" title="Wearing_And_Tearing">
It starts out like a murmur
And then it grows like thunder
Till it bursts inside-a you.
Try and hold it steady
Wait until you're ready
Any second now will do.
Throw the door wide open
Not a word is spoken
Anything that's you wanna do, yeah.
You know, an' ya know, an' ya know
An' ya know, an' ya know, an' ya know
An' ya know, an' ya know, an' ya know.
Now don't you feel the same way?
Now don't you feel the same way?
But you don't know what to do, yeah.
No time for hesitatin'
Ain't no time for hesitatin'
All you got to do is move.
They say, you're feelin' blue, well
I've just found a cure
It's a thing you've gotta do, yeah.
You know, an' ya know, an' ya know
An' ya know, an' ya know, an' ya know
An' ya know, an' ya know, an' ya know.
Now listen:
Well, ya say your body's achin'?
Well, I know that it's achin'
Chill bumps come up on you.
Yeah, the fun and foolin'
I love the fun and foolin'
Just like foolin' after school.
An' then you ask for medication
Who cares for medication
When you've worn away the cure?
You know, an' ya know, an' ya know
An' ya know, an' ya know, an' ya know
An' ya know, an' ya know, an' ya know.
Hey-ha, hey-hey
Hey-ha, hey-hey
Hey-ha, hey-hey.
Go back to the country
Yeah, go back to the country
Feel a change is good for you.
When ya keep convincin'
Ah, don't keep convincin'
But what's that creepin' up behind a-you?
It's just an old friend
It's just an old friend
And what's that he's got for you?
You know, an' ya know, an' ya know
An' ya know, an' ya know, an' ya know
An' ya know, an' ya know, an' ya know.
Hey-yeah! Hey-yeah!
Can feel it. Yeah!
Can feel it. Hey-yeah!
Feel it. Hey-yeah!
Feel it. Yeah!
Feel it. Hey-yeah!
Feel it. Oh!
Feel it.
Medication, a-medication, medication!
