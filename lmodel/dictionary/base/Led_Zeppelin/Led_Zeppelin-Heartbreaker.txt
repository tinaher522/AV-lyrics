<song artist="Led_Zeppelin" title="Heartbreaker">
Hey, fellas, have ya heard the news
Ya know that Annie's back in town
It won't take long, just watch and see
All the fellas lay their money down
Her style is new but the face the same as it was so long ago
But from her eyes, a different smile like of the one who knows
Well, it's been ten years or maybe more
Since I first set eyes on you
The best years of my life gone by, here I am alone and blue
Some people cry and some people die by the wicked ways of love
But I'll just keep on rollin' along
With the grace from the Lord above
People talkin' all around 'bout the way you left me flat
I don't care what the people say, I know where their jive is at
One thing I do have on my mind
If you could clarify, please do
It's the way you call me another guy's name
When I try to make love to you, yeah
I try to make love, it ain't no use
Give it to me, give it
Mm, worked so hard I couldn't unwind, get some money saved
Abuse my love a thousand times however hard I tried
Heartbreaker, your time has come, can't take your evil way
Go away you heartbreaker, heartbreaker, heartbreaker, heart
