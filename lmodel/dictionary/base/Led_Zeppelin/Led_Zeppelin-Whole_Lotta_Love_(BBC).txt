<song artist="Led_Zeppelin" title="Whole_Lotta_Love_(BBC)">
You need coolin', a-baby, I ain't foolin'
I'm gonna send ya back t' schoolin'
Way down inside, I'm gonna give you my love
I'm gonna give you my love
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Whole lotta love
Whole lotta love
Wanna whole lotta love
Wanna whole lotta love
You've been yearnin', a-baby, I've been learnin'
All them good times, baby, I've been deservin'
Way way down inside, honey, you need love

A-keep a-coolin' baby
Coolin' baby
I know it is away from me but
Everytime I think about you, I'm gonna get so hot
Ain't nothin' I can do, babe
Ain't nothin' I can do, sweet babe
I think it's time I got away from here
I got those West Bromwich blues
And there ain't not a single thing I can do, no
Hey, I guess I must be really goin'
Ain't nothin' I can do
