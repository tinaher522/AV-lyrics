<song artist="Led_Zeppelin" title="What_Is_And_What_Should_Never_Be">
And if I say to you tomorrow
"Take my hand, child, come with me"
It's to a castle I will take you
Where what's to be, they say will be
A-catch the wind, see us spin
Sail away, leave today
Way up high in the sky, and whoah!
But the wind won't blow, we really shouldn't go
It only goes to show that you will be mine by takin' our time
Oooh, ho-whoa
And if you say to me tomorrow
"Oh, what fun it all would be"
Then what's to stop us, pretty baby-ay
But what is and what should never be
A-catch the wind, see us spin
Sail away, leave today
Way up high in the sky, and whoah!
But the wind won't blow, we really shouldn't go
Only goes to show that you will be mine a-by takin' our time
Oooh, ohh, oh
So if you wake up with the sunrise
And all your dreams are still as new
And happiness is what you need so bad
Well, girl, the answer lies (with) you, yeah
A-catch the wind, see us spin
Sail away, leave today
Way up high in the sky, and whoah!
But the wind won't blow, we really shouldn't go
It only goes to show-ow that you will be mine by takin' our time
Oooh
Hey, ho, ma
A-well, the wind won't blow, and we really shouldn't go
And it only goes to show-whoa-whoa-whoa
Catch the wind, we're gonna see us spin
We're gonna sail, leave today-a
A-do-do-do, ba-ba-n-do, oh
Ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, yeah
Everybody I know seems to know me well
But they're never gonna know I'm gonna move like hell
A-baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, ho, I love ya
Baby, baby, babe, huh, oh, I love ya
Do, no, no, no, no, no, no, come on, now
