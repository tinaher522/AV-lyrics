<song artist="Led_Zeppelin" title="Babe_I'm_Gonna_Leave_You">
Babe, baby, baby, I'm gonna leave you
I said, baby, you know I'm gonna leave you
I'm leave you when the summertime
Leave you when the summer comes a-rollin'
Leave you when the summer comes along
Babe, babe, babe, babe, babe, babe, baby, mm-baby
I'll wanna leave you 
I ain't jokin', woman, I've got to ramble
Oh, yeah, baby, baby, I'll be leavin', really nn-got to ramble  
(I can hear it callin' me)
I can hear it callin' me the way it used to do
Oh, I can hear it callin' me back ho-wome
Baby, oh, babe, I'm gonna leave you
Oh, baby, you know I've really got to leave you
Oh, I can hear it callin' me
I said, don't you hear it callin' me the way it used to do, oh
I know, I know
I know I never, never, never, never, never gonna leave you, babe
But I gotta go away from this place, I gotta quit you, yeah
Oh, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, oh
You hear it callin'
Don't you hear it callin' me
Oh, woman, ah, a-woman, I know, I know
Feels good to have you back again, and I know that one day, baby
It's gonna really grow, yes it is
We're gonna go walkin' through the park every day
Come what may, every day, oh, my, my, my, my, my, my babe
I'm gonna leave you, go away
Oh, alright.
So good sweet baby
It was really, really good
You made me happy every single day
But now I've got to go away, oh, oh, oh
Baby, baby, baby
That's when it's callin' me
I said, that's when it's callin' me back home
