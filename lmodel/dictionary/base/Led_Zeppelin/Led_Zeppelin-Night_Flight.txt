<song artist="Led_Zeppelin" title="Night_Flight">
I received a message from my brother 'cross the water
He sat laughin' as he wrote, "The end's in sight"
So I said goodbye to all my friends
And packed my hopes inside a matchbox
'Cause I know it's time to fly
Oh-oh-oh-hoh, yeah, come on, meet me in the mornin'
Meet me in the middle of the night
Ah-ow, yeah, the mornin' light is comin'
Don't it make ya wanna kinda feel alright?
Ooh, yeah, ah-hah
I just jumped a train that never stops
So now somehow they'll know I'll never finish payin' for my ride
Someone push the gun into my hand
Tell me I'm the type of man to fight the fight without inquiring
Oh-oh-oh-hoh, yeah, ha, come on, meet me in the mornin'
Won't you meet me in the middle of the night, night, night, yeah?
Hoh-oh, well, the mornin' light is comin'
Well, don't it make you wanna kinda feel alright?
Oh, mama, well, I think it's time I'm leavin'
Nothin' here to make me stay
Whoa, mama, well it must be time to go and
They're knockin' down them doors, they're tryin'a take me away
Please, Mr. Brakeman, won'tcha ring your bell?
And leave me lyin' clear
Uh, please, Mr. Fireman, won'tcha ring your bell?
Tell the people they got to fly away from here
Ooh, I once saw a picture of a lady with a baby
Somethin' made her have a very, very special smile
We are in the middle of a change in destination
When the train stops, altogether we will smile
Oh-oh-oh-hoh, come on, come on, now, meet me in the mornin'
Won'tcha meet me in the middle of the night, night
N-ni-ni-night, hoh, hoh, yeah
Everybody know the mornin' time is comin'
Don't it make ya wanna a-feel alright?
Ah, ah, yeah, a-make me feel alri-ight
Fly now, baby
A-get to flyin', fly now, baby
Uhh-ay, hey, hey
Uh, uh, uh, uh
