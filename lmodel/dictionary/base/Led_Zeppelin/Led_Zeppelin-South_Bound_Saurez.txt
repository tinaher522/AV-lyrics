Baby, when you walk that sweet walk
Oh, you walk it good, yes you walk it good
I said, baby, when you talk that sweet talk
It sounds so good, oh, so good.
With a little bit of concentration
And a little bit of helpin' hands, yeah
And a little bit of raving madness
You know, it makes me feel, baby
Both my feet are back on the ground.
And when the rhythm takes me
It feels so good, oh, so good
Baby, if it keeps a-shaking
It will do you good, oh so much good
With a little bit of stop-a-shakin', shakin'
And a little bit of slow right down
And a little bit of sweet con-carne
It makes me feel, makes me feel, yeah
I got my feet on the ground.
Ooh, now, baby, when you move, it makes me, yeah
A-really feel so good, oh, so good
And I'm so glad, so glad, so glad, so glad
And I'm good, oh, so good.
With a little bit of, ooh, ah, concentration
Just a little bit of a-helping hand, yeah
With a little bit of raving madness
It makes me feel, oh, it makes me feel
Like I'm back on the ground, oh, yes, it sure does.
It makes me feel, hey, yeah
Back on the ground.
Saurez! Saurez!
Baby, baby, you back on the ground, yeah.
