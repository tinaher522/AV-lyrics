<song artist="Led_Zeppelin" title="Bron-Y-Aur_Stomp">
Ah, I caught you smilin' at me, that's the way it should be
Like a leaf is to a tree, so fine
Ah, all the good times we had, I sung love songs so glad
Always smilin', never sad, so fine
As we walk down the country lanes
I'll be singin' a song, you hear me callin' your name
Hear the wind whisper in the trees
Tellin' Mother Nature 'bout you and me
Well, if the sun shines so bright, or our way is dark as night
The road we choose is always right, so fine
Ah, could any love be so strong when so many loves go wrong
Will our love go on and on and on and on and on and on?
As we walk down the country lanes
I'm singin' a song, hear me callin' your name
Hear the wind whisper in the trees
Tellin' Mother Nature 'bout a-you and me
My, my, law-de-law, come on, now, it ain't too far
Tell your friends all around the world
Ain't no companion like a blue-eyed Merle
Come on, now, well, let me tell ya
What you're missin', messin' around them brick walls
So, of one thing I am sure, it's a friendship so pure
Angels singin' all 'round my door, so fine
Yeah, ain't but one thing to do, spend my natural life with you
You're the finest dog I knew, so fine
When you're old and your eyes are dim
There ain't no 'Old Shep' gonna happen again
We'll still go walkin' down country lanes
I'll sing the same old song, hear me call your name
