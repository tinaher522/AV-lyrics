<song artist="Led_Zeppelin" title="Gallows_Pole">
Hangman, hangman, hold it a little while
I think I see my friends coming,
Riding a many mile
Friends, did you get some silver?
Did you get a little gold?
What did you bring me, my dear friends,
To keep me from the gallows pole?
What did you bring me to keep me from the gallows pole?
I couldn't get no silver, I couldn't get no gold
You know that we're too damn poor
To keep you from the gallows pole.
Hangman, hangman, hold it a little while
I think I see my brother coming,
Riding many a mile
Brother, did you get me some silver?
Did you get a little gold?
What did you bring me, my brother,
To keep me from the gallows pole?
Brother, I brought you some silver, yeah,
I brought a little gold
I brought a little of everything
To keep you from the gallows pole
Yes, I brought you to keep you from the gallows pole.
Hangman, hangman, turn your head awhile
I think I see my sister coming,
Riding a many mile, mile, mile, mile
Sister, I implore you,
Take him by the hand
Take him to some shady bower
Save me from the wrath of this man
Please take him, save me from the wrath of this man, man.
Hangman, hangman, upon your face a smile
Tell me that I'm free to ride
And ride for many mile, mile, mile.
Oh, yes, you got a fine sister,
She warmed my blood from cold
She brought my blood to boiling hot
To keep you from the gallows pole,
Pole, pole, pole, yeah, yeah.
Your brother brought me silver
And your sister warmed my soul
But now I laugh and pull so hard,
See you swinging on the gallows pole, yeah
But now I laugh and pull so hard,
See you swinging on the gallows pole, pole, pole
Swingin' on the gallows pole
Swingin' on the gallows pole
Swingin' on the gallows pole
Swingin' on the gallows pole, pole, pole,
Pole, pole, pole, pole, yeah.
