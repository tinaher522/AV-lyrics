<song artist="Sam_Smith" title="Nirvana">
Oh, baby
Oh, baby
Oh, we both know the truth
If it were the real me and you
This wouldn't be the right thing to do
Now the room is all hazy
We're too lost in the fumes
I feel like it's just me and you
Yeah, we got nothing to lose
It's too late to run away from it all
It's too late to get away from it all
I'm done with running, so I give it to you
This moment has caused a reaction
Resulting in a reattachment
Girl, you take me to Nirvana
I don't think this will last
Cause you're here in my arms
Oh, baby
Oh, baby
Oh, we both feel the same
I'm not gonna give you my name
And I don't think you want that to change
We're in this together
We don't know who we are
Even if it's moving too fast
Maybe we should take it too far
It's too late to run away from it all
It's too late to get away from it all
I'm done with running, so I give it to you
This moment has caused a reaction
Resulting in a reattachment
Girl, you take me to Nirvana
I don't think this will last
Cause you're here in my arms
Well, you take me to Nirvana
I don't think this will last 
Cause you're here in my arms
