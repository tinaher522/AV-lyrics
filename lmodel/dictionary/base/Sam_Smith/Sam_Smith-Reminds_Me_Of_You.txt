<song artist="Sam_Smith" title="Reminds_Me_Of_You">
I've gotta get out of here
This town's no longer fun
And I'm falling closer, falling closer
Closer to the sun
I've gotta get out of here
Come kiss another face
'Cause it hurts too bad, it hurts too bad
And I don't like the taste
You say it's over, leaving me so far from sober
Now summer is colder, I lean on a stranger's shoulder
I walk the streets and hear heartbeats and city smoulder
Without a trace I'm under
And God knows I try
Looking for lovers at night
But each time I do
It only reminds me of you
It only reminds me of you
I've gotta get out of here
'Cause you'll never want me back
You are moving on, moving on
And I'm stuck on the track
I've gotta get out of here
Before I self-destruct
And I don't want, and I don't want
My heart to ever stop
I walk the streets and hear heartbeats and city smolder
Without a trace I'm under
And God knows I try
Looking for lovers at night
But each time I do
It only reminds me of you
It only reminds me of you
And God knows I try
Looking for lovers at night
But each time I do
It only reminds me of you
It only reminds me of you
It only reminds me of you
