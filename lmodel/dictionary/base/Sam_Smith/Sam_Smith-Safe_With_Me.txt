<song artist="Sam_Smith" title="Safe_With_Me">
My heart will beat, my heart will beat, my heart will beat,
If you ever need me just tell me and I'll be there
'cause I was build for you
Yeah I was build to carry all your feelings
'cause I won't let them know
I won't let you go, baby
I don't care what your past is, I don't need no answers just have faith in me
Don't you know you're a secret's safe with me?
My heart will beat, my heart will beat, my heart will beat
All your worries can be through if you, if you come and see
Don't you know you're a secret's safe with me?
My heart will beat, my heart will beat, my heart will beat
All your worries can be through if you, if you come and see
No need to step back, don't be scared I got you you know that
I'm here and your out side when all your clouds turn back
'cause I won't let you go, baby
I don't care what your past is, I don't need no answers just have faith in me
Don't you know you're a secret's safe with me?
My heart will beat, my heart will beat, my heart will beat
All your worries can be through if you, if you come and see
Don't you know you're a secret's safe with me?
My heart will beat, my heart will beat, my heart will beat
All your worries can be through if you, if you come to see
My heart will beat, my heart will beat
