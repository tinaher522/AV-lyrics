<song artist="Sam_Smith" title="Make_It_To_Me">
My mind runs away to you
With the thought I hope you'll see
Can't see where it's wandered too
But I know where it wants to be
I'm waiting patiently though time is moving slow
I have one vacancy and I wanted you to know that
You're the one designed for me
A distant stranger that I will complete
I know you're out there we're meant to be
So keep your hair down and make it to me
And make it to me
So sick of this lonely air
It seems such a waste of breath
So much that I need to say
So much to get off my chest
I'm waiting patiently though time is moving slow
I have one vacancy and I wanted you to know that
You're the one designed for me
A distant stranger that I will complete
I know you're out there we're meant to be
So keep your hair down and make it to me
Make it to me
Make it to me
Make it to me
