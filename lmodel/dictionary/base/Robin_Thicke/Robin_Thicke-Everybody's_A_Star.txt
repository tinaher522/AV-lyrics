<song artist="Robin_Thicke" title="Everybody's_A_Star">
Everybody is a star
I got knocked down
But I got back up
They told me NO
But I won't give up
I work around the clock
And it ain't never enough
I'm gonna burn so bright when you light me up
Or not baby
When I step up to the plate
Everybody stands up
When I'm doin' my thang
People put their hands up
When my job ain't cuttin' it
I still gon wear my heat babe
Everybody is a star
I'm gonna be a star
Walkin' through the mall
Lookin' in the store
Working in a restaurant
Standin' at the bus stop
Everybody knows me
I'm gonna be a star
Dancin' on the floor
Diggin' their coat
Standin' in line
Makin' your heart stop
Everybody knows me
I'm gonna be a star
That is why I feel it deep inside
A new invention runnin' through my mind
I got the melody to the second verse
Part of my life
When I step up to the plate
Everybody stands up
When I'm doin' my thang
People put their hands up
When my job ain't cuttin' it
I still gon wear my heat babe
Everybody is a star
I'm gonna be a star
Walkin' through the mall
Lookin' in the store
Working in a restaurant
Standin' at the bus stop
Everybody knows me
I'm gonna be a star
Dancin' on the floor
Diggin' their coat
Standin' in line
Makin' your heart stop
Everybody knows me
I'm gonna be a star
Walkin' through the mall
Lookin' in the store
Working in a restaurant
Standin' at the bus stop
Everybody knows me
I'm gonna be a star
Dancin' on the floor
Diggin' their coat
Standin' in line
Makin' your heart stop
Everybody knows me
I'm gonna be a star
Everybody is a star
I'm gonna be a star
Everybody is a star
I'm gonna be a star
Everybody is a star
I'm gonna be a star
