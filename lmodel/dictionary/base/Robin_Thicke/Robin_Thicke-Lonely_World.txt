<song artist="Robin_Thicke" title="Lonely_World">
Sexy girl on a plane
Why you crying? What's your name?
Who you running from?
Teddy bear, pink room
Fresh out of high school
Sweet like the evening sun
Mama says don't you think you're special
Daddy says you're my queen
She's afraid, she's going nowhere
Locked and lost between
But oh, lonely girl don't you worry babe?
How can you get by?
Lonely girl don't you live your life
Through someone else's eyes?
Egg-faced boy on a train
Why you sad? What's your name?
Who you running from?
Packed house, shared jeans
Front porch, moon beams
He's gotta get out of this town
No more Bible he will travel
He'll learn so much in school
Daddy drinks himself into courage
Says "Fuck you, I'm no fool"
Oh lonely boy, don't you worry, baby?
How can you get by?
Lonely boy don't you see your life
In someone else's eyes?
Lonely girl, don't you worry, babe?
How can you get by?
Lonely girl, don't you live your life
Through someone else's eyes?
Oh dream on
Dream on dreamers
Keep on dreaming
Beautiful mom can you smile?
Can you glow, can you sing me my favorite song?
Got fever, warm clothes are clean, kids are gone
What to do she's a sleeping sun.
She says birds fly out her window
She watches jealously
She says she's too old for new things
But mama you got wings
Oh lonely girl, don't you loose your dreams in someone else's cries
Lonely girl, don't you see your life in someone else's eyes
Lonely world, don't you find your faith in someone else's lies
Lonely world, don't you live your life through someone else's eyes
Oh dream on
Dream on dreamers
Keep on dream on
