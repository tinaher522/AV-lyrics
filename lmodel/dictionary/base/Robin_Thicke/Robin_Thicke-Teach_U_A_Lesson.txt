<song artist="Robin_Thicke" title="Teach_U_A_Lesson">
You feel so good
You smell so good
You feel so warm
Just like I knew you would
I can't let you go
I can't let you go
I can't let you go
You were late to school
I'm gonna have to see you after class
You've been a bad girl
Someone's gonna have to teach you a lesson
You've been a bad girl
Someone's gonna have to straighten you right out
You've been a bad girl
Someone's gonna have to teach you
Teach you, teach you, teach you
You can call me 'Professor'
But baby you broke the rules
You won't get the grade you want
Unless you stay after school
You can work it off
Baby I can give you extra credit
But there's something else
You were late to school
Teach you, teach you, teach you
Girl, can I frisk you?
Search your body for
You look so guilty to me
If I make you nervous
It's 'cause youre hiding WMDs
And I'm gonna sentence you
Baby you can do your time on me
I can't let you go
I can't let you go
You were late to school
I'm gonna have to see you after class
You've been a bad girl
Someone's gonna have to teach you a lesson
You've been a bad girl
Someone's gonna have to straighten you right out
You've been a bad girl
Just for the momment,
For tonight
Can I make you mine?
Is it me, is it mine?
Can I love you all my life?
