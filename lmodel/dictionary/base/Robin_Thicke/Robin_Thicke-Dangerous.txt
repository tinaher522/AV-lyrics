<song artist="Robin_Thicke" title="Dangerous">
I'm dangerous so dangerous 
I'm dangerous, you better stay away
Stay away from me, I'm dangerous 
I'm dangerous, so dangerous 
You're a lone hitch hiker
And I'm a traveling truck
You better not get on this ride
You might lose your luck
I'm dangerous 
You better heed the signs 
The skull and cross bone nights 
Stops lights in use
I'm slippery when wild
Cautions and red flags 
I'm gonna cross that line 
I'm dangerous 
So don't you 
Don't you say maybe
Baby I'm crazy
Crazy for wanting 
Wanting you badly
Madly I'm serious 
And you're so curious
But I'm too dangerous (dangerous) 
You better not kiss me once
You better not fall in love 
I'm a pterodactyl 
And you're a wondering duck
I don't mean to be greedy
But it's never enough
I'm dangerous
I'll tell you I love you 
And I'll believe it's true 
Oh and then I'll do something
So bad to you 
And you'll say I hate you 
And you'll be screaming in a dream
Where no one can hear you
So don't you 
Don't you say maybe
Baby I'm crazy
Crazy for wanting 
Wanting you badly
Madly I'm serious 
And you're so curious
But I'm too dangerous (dangerous) 
You're idealistic 
So filled with glee
You see me as your shining prince 
But I'm a treacherous king 
You'll accept my olive branch
But I'm poison iiiiiivvvyyyyy
I'm dangerous, so dangerous 
I'm dangerous, so dangerous 
you better say away
Stay away from me 
I'm dangerous 
So da da da da da
da da da da da da 
da da da da da da
