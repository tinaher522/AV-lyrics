<song artist="Robin_Thicke" title="Stupid_Things">
Just charge it to my account
I hope I haven't gone over my limit
With interest rates so swift
No need to scream and shout
No doubt if women are from Venus now
I'll get to them somehow
All I want to do is please you
Please myself by living my life too
And all the stupid things I do
Have absolutely no reflection on How I feel about you
How I feel about
All the stupid things I do have absolutely no reflection on 
How I feel about you 
How I feel about you yeah
Oh yes I recall
Skipping on breakfast to play basketball
Then feeling two feet small

Sometimes you read like William Shakes
Your scent is sweet like Betty Crooker bakes
I'd love to have your cake and eat it to
All I want to do is please you 
Please myself by living my life too
And all the stupid things I do
Have absolutely no reflection on How I feel about you
How I feel about
All the stupid things I do have absolutely no reflection on 
How I feel about you 
How I feel about you yeah
And all the stupid things I do
Have absolutely no reflection on How I feel about you
How I feel about
Oh how I feel about you
How I feel about you yeah
