<song artist="Robin_Thicke" title="I'm_'A_Be_Alright">
I had my dreams woken
Man I almost got some
I had my car stolen
Now my radios gone
I had this fine woman
I couldn't get none
It seems like the world is up against me
For something I've done
I still got my mind, still got my music baby
I'm a be alright (x2)
All of my bills are pilin cause I spent what I owe
I wasn't invited to any parties, so I'm throwing my own
Can't get a job cause I ain't been lookin for one
I'm a be alright

I'm a keep on dancin
I'm a get the champange all to myself
I'm a be alright 
I'm a keep it movin
I'm a give this love all over the world
And on and on
Here she comes hawkin
She's tire as all hell
She's lookin at me for somethin
The sheeba can't tell
I'm on my mind
I sit at my radio all day baby
I'm a be alright
