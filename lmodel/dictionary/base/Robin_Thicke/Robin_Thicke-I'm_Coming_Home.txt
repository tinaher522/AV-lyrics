<song artist="Robin_Thicke" title="I'm_Coming_Home">
I don't wanna lie anymore
San Francisco open up your door
I don't wanna cry anymore
San Francisco open up your door
I've been begging
Begging for so long
Baltimore open up your door
I've been losing my mind in Chicago
Ooh, Chicago don't be so blind
I left my heart in Jackson
Left my soul in Memphis
Left my smile in Alabama
My soul all alone
Coming home
An empty man
I need a loving hand
That all my pieces of my soul
Back in line
I'm coming home
I'm coming home baby
My daddy don't recognize what grew lies
My mama don't recognize my new state of mind
My girl don't understand why I cry
I'm picking up the pieces
That I left behind
Down here in Jackson
There's some mystery
You don't wanna remember
Down here in New Orleans
When you gotta
Gotta learn to survive
I left my heart in Jackson
Left my soul in Memphis
Left my smile in Alabama
My soul all alone
Coming home
An empty man
I need a loving hand
That all my pieces of my soul
Back in line
I'm coming home
I'm coming home baby
