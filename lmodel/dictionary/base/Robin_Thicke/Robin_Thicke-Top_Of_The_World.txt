<song artist="Robin_Thicke" title="Top_Of_The_World">
Come on come on
Now you feeling like a pimp, you got everything you want, no wonder
Come on come on
Cause you never gave up, now you singing that song all summer
I'm on top of the world, on top of the world
I'm on top of the world, on top of the world
I'm on top of the world, on top of the world
I'm on top of the world, top of the world
She was a little girl picked in the school
Yeah she had funny teeth, all the kids called her tooth head
Years later when her ma got sicked, she did everything she could, but mama won't rich
She didn't stop, worked hard different jobs yeah
Dad put her through community college
Waitress, retail, hot dog on a stair
Telling herself daddy wanted her like this
Now she the boss, she the boss, she the boss
You see her writing up, can you know what it cost
Now she the one with the smile on her face
Cause no one gave her to you, she earned that feeling
Come on come on
Now you feeling like a pimp, you got everything you want, no wonder
Come on come on
Cause you never gave up, now you singing that song all summer
I'm on top of the world, on top of the world
I'm on top of the world, on top of the world
I'm on top of the world, on top of the world
I'm on top of the world, top of the world
Now she wanna find love, but she can?
Somebody who can hold her, better serenade
But she's a little hard cloak with the pros, could be goodbye goodbye before it's hello hello
Before you say a word, better hold your breath
Sitting with mine, if you have it ooh
I'm in sometime, but she's a lifestyle
I got a big head but my baby is a hot ride
Come on come on
Now you feeling like a pimp, you got everything you want, no wonder
Come on come on
Cause you never gave up, now you singing that song all summer
I'm on top of the world, on top of the world
I'm on top of the world, on top of the world
I'm on top of the world, on top of the world
I'm on top of the world, top of the world
Baby on top of it, baby on top of it, baby, she's on top of it
Baby on top of it
Yeah sometimes that's just how it goes
Now she well paid first class top grade go to sleep by herself only with the front page
Dreaming of a one then she ain't got yet
That's somebody to hold when the sun sets
She starts thinking of peers, just to feel good, it's harder not to be what she wants
What else just keep it real, but she remember how tough it was to get her
She can't be so hard on herself yet,
You need a good time baby girl let it go
You need a good time baby girl let it go
You still so young, good times, let it go
You still so young, good times, let it go
Come on come on
Now you feeling like a pimp, you got everything you want, no wonder
Come on come on
Cause you never gave up, now you singing that song all summer
I'm on top of the world, on top of the world
I'm on top of the world, on top of the world
I'm on top of the world, on top of the world
I'm on top of the world, top of the world
