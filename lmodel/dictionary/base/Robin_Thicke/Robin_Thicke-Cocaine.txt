<song artist="Robin_Thicke" title="Cocaine">
Baby, Beverly Hills Hotel, four AM
It's my birthday
I wanna stay young
I wanna have fun
I don't wanna be the only one no way
Movie stars models and blondes and cocaine
New York, LA, it's all the same
The angels look the other way
'Cause they can understand my pain
Cocaine, back up in a big way
Cocaine, comin' out the closets
Cocaine, I'm standin' in an alley
With my hands behind me
The club just ain't the same without the cocaine
Ooh, downtown, upstairs, get down
Midnight, high art, underground
Hip hop, blue jeans, it's all around
I wanna stay young, ooh
Everybody's watchin' but no one talks about it
Right now there's only one name you can't call it
She said sex just ain't the same without it, it's cocaine
Cocaine, back up in a big way
Cocaine, comin' out the closets
Cocaine, I'm standin' in an alley
With my hands behind me
The club just ain't the same without the cocaine
