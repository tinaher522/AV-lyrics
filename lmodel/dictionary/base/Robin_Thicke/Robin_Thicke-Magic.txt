Hey… 
Wooo… 
Alright baby…. 
Ohhh… 
Oh…. 
Yeah… 
I can make the pain disappear 
And I can erase the past ohh 
I can make the future shine so bright 
And I can make right now alright yeah 
I got it you got it we got the magic girl 
I got it you got it we got the magic girl 
I got it you got it we got the magic girl 
I got it you got it we got the magic girl 
All I got is concrete all around me wooo… 
But I can see the countryside 
You can be rich when you're poor 
Poor when you're rich 
It can be raining and I can make the sun shine 

I got it you got it we got (wooo) the magic girl 
I got it (you know you got it baby) you got it we got the magic girl 
I got it (I've got it baby) you got it we got the magic girl 
I got it (You know I got it baby) you got it we got the magic girl 
I know sometimes sometimes you feel no hope 
Well I've been there, I've walked that lonely road 
I took whatever devil offered me 
Because I knew that he would set me free 
(whoa) I got it you got it (wooo) we got the magic girl 
I got it (magic baby) you got it we got the magic (woo) girl 
I got it (we got the magic baby) you got it we got the magic girl 
Skip 
I got it you got it we got the magic girl wooo 
Science they can't prove it 
But I know I can do it 
I can fly 
I can bend metal with my mind 
I can wake up in a paradise ohhhh 

We got that magic 
We got that magic 
We got that magic 
We got that magic 
Hey 
We got that magic 
We got that magic 
Ewww 
Got that magic come on 
Hey 
I got it you got it we got that magic girl 
I got it you got it we got that magic girl 
I got it you got it we got that magic girl 
I got it you got it we got that magic girl 
Everyday
