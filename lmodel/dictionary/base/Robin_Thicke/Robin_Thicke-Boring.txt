<song artist="Robin_Thicke" title="Boring">
Why would I go to Rome
And stand in St. Peter's Square
Or gaze at Mona Lisa 
With someone who can't compare
I never go without you 
I wouldn't even dare
Like Rio De Janeiro was never even there
No need to spend my birthday 
With all of my friends in New York City (Boring)
No need to have floor seats 
Sevens games Celtics and Kobe
(Boring)
You make me say glory hallelujah 
You're never boring (never boring)
Girl you know you make me say
Glory Hallelujah (glory) 
You're never boring (never boring)
Girl you know you make me say
Glory hallelujah
Make me say glory (glory)
There's no need to go
To Victoria Secret's show
Or stay in St. Tropaez 
On Jay and Beyonce's boat
No supermodel or Obama 
Could interest me more
It's like everything's meaningless 
Without you close
You make me say glory hallelujah 
You're never boring (never boring)
Girl you know you make me say
Glory hallelujah (glory) 
You're never boring (never boring)
Ooo
Girl you know you driving me crazy
you make me say
Glory hallelujah (baby, woo)
Make me say glory 
You make me say
Glory Hallelujah 
Oooo you make me say 
Glory hallelujah
Glory hallelujah
Oooo come on girl 
You make me wanna say
Glory hallelujah (hallelujah) 
Ohhh ohh woah woah woah woah ohh
Glory (glory) hallelujah (hallelujah)
Glory (boring, boring, boring, boring) 
You make me say [x2]
Glory hallelujah
