<song artist="Robin_Thicke" title="2_Luv_Birds">
She loved to fly, She ran away
From something at home, she would not say
She needed new friends, no doors would open
She had no place to stay
Then came a bird, Who knew the town
Who barely ever left the ground
They saw each other, they saw forever
They both knew it right away, oh!
Two love birds, two love signs
You got me going out of my mind
I love you for a lifetime
You got me going out of my mind
Two love birds, two love signs
You got me going out of my mind
I love you for a lifetime
You got me going out of my mind
They had it good, not lots of stuff
Not lots of money, just lots of love
She started working, he learned to cook
Somehow they made their way
Then they started flying all alone on their own
Up in the sky and now they're never ever home
They started fighting, then it got silent
They didn't know how to make it without each other
They're just two love birds, two love signs
You got me going out of my mind
I love you for a lifetime
You got me going out of my mind
Two love birds, two love signs
You got me going out of my mind
I love you for a lifetime
You got me going out of my mind
Two love birds, two love signs
You got me going out of my mind
I love you for a lifetime
You got me going out of my mind
Two love birds, two love signs
You got me going out of my mind
I love you for a lifetime
You got me going out of my mind
Two love birds, two love signs
You got me going out of my mind
I love you for a lifetime
You got me going out of my mind
