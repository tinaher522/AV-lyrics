Huh

Or the money you make and how it all goes down 
I think that its about keepin ones you love near 
That's why im on the hop thinking you should be here 
Maybe I should hurry up get by your side 
Follow you around just be on your time 
Or maybe I should just leave you behind 
Maybe Im keeping you from a chance at a better life 
Oh 
Then I call you and I come out and tell you straight up 
Baby I, I need your love 
And you go sidestep, Pull me around 
Put out your hand, Put me on down and I 
Wanna know why, why you don't need my love 
Then you go sidestep, Swing me around 
Put out your hand, Put me on down and I 
Wanna know why, why you aint in no hurry for my love

On the telephone telling me tired of being alone 
But we staying up allnight 
Talking about I aint doing right

Hoping we can find a new way to understand babe 
And maybe we can be a better woman and man
