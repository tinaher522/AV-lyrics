(Does it feel good?)
(Does it feel good?)
(Does it feel real good, good, good, good, good, good?)
(Does it feel good?)
(Does it feel good?)
If I told you that I love you, would you run away?
Or would you run to me?
I need to know it, babe
If gave you all my loving, would you give it back?
What would you do with that?
I ask a lot of that
And if I gave you all my time when it's the summer time,
And on my down time,
Girl that's a lot of time
If I'm falling over you, then what you gonna do?
I wanna come with you, 
I wanna run with you

I'll give you all my loving to you
I'll give you all my loving to you
Ooh, ooh!

Does it feel good?
Ooh, ooh
Does it feel good?
Huh, darlin'?
Does it feel good?
Ooh, ooh
Does it feel real good?
Does it feel good?
Huh, babe?
Does it feel good?
Huh, darlin'?
Does it feel good?
Oooh!
Does it feel good?

If I partied 'till the morning, would you stay with me?
Girl, would you play with me? 
Or would you hate on me?
If I ran all out of money, would you pay for me?
Or would you stray for me?
I need to know it, babe
If there's something that I could do to make you see the light,
Girl that I'll treat you right, 
I'd do it every night
Every second that I'm with you, it's a special world
Like I'm your only man, and your my only girl

I'll give you all my loving to you
I'll give you all my loving to you
Ooh, ooh!

Does it feel good?
Ooh, ooh
Does it feel good?
Huh, darlin'?
Does it feel good?
Ooh, ooh
Does it feel real good?
Does it feel good?
Huh, babe?
Does it feel good?
Huh, darlin'?
Does it feel good?
Oooh!
Does it feel good?

(Does it feel good.. good?)
(Does it feel good.. good?)
(Does it feel good?)
(D-d-d does it feel good?)
Huh, babe?
Huh, darlin?
Ooh!
Does it feel good (good, good, good, good?)
Does it feel good (good, good, good, good?)

I'll give you all... my loving to you
I'll give you all... my loving to you
Ooh, ooh!

Does it feel good?
Ooh, ooh
Does it feel good?
Huh, darlin'?
Does it feel good?
Ooh, ooh
Does it feel real good?
Does it feel good?
Huh, babe?
Does it feel good?
Huh, darlin'?
Does it feel good?
Oooh!
Does it feel good?
