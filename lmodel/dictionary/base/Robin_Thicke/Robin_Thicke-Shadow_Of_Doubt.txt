a-doo doo doo 
a-doo doo doo 
a-doo doo doo 
gotta fight the shadow of doubt 
a-doo doo doo 
a-doo doo doo 
a-doo doo doo 
gotta fight the shadow of doubt 
it's holding me 
it's got me down 
i'm no stranger 
stranger to the shadow of doubt 
its to the end 
there's no surrender 
its good and evil 
gotta fight the shadow of doubt 
i'm in flames 
i'm on fire 
i wanna dance like i'm james brown 

a-doo doo doo 
a-doo doo doo 
a-doo doo doo 
gotta fight the shadow of doubt 
a-doo doo doo 
a-doo doo doo 
a-doo doo doo 
gotta fight the shadow of doubt 
i've had enough 
off with the glove 
a full fighter 
i'm looking for love 
i'm fat larry 
i'm skinny d 
i'm on the runaway 
take off with me 

a-doo doo doo 
a-doo doo doo 
a-doo doo doo 
gotta fight the shadow of doubt 
a-doo doo doo 
a-doo doo doo 
a-doo doo doo 
gotta fight the shadow of doubt 
ooh, i got a war going on in my head 
and i just cant seem to shake this feeling off, oh! 
negativity coming over me, ooooh oooh oooh! 
keep firing 
keep shooting 
i get anxious 
i get nervous 
i'm impatient 
i'm curious 
i've gotta ravel up 
no i don't! 
a-doo doo doo 
a-doo doo doo 
a-doo doo doo 
gotta fight the shadow of doubt 
a-doo doo doo 
a-doo doo doo 
a-doo doo doo 
gotta fight the shadow of doubt 
keep striving 
i keep pushing 
i keep trying 
i keep fighting 
shadow, shadow, shadow 
gotta fight the shadow of doubt 
shadow, shadow, shadow 
gotta fight the shadow of doubt 
shadow, shadow, shadow 
gotta fight the shadow of doubt 
gotta fight the shadow of doubt 
gotta fight the shadow of doubt
