<song artist="Robin_Thicke" title="Dirty_Girl">
Girl you're bugging me
Sure enough you're always busy pushing me
Well u don't want to treat me like that
Waited patently
Yet still you're playing everything turseptuly  
This time got the ass gonna crack
Bridge 
U Take my trust and through it away  
Take the money I should have been paid
Making fools of the both of us
Things getting dangerous 
I don't want to give no more
Chorus
I think u've  
Gotta grip back on your act
Watch your back
I'm gonna get it right
Don't think i'm gonna take that gold attack
Where u at
It's happened tonight
I wanna be surely your inner friend
I'm not insane that's where it's Gonna lead
Coz I ain't gonna want somebody else's dirty girl on me
I won't ask u twice
How come all your friends deny your alibis  
They ain't saying were you've been 
Don't apologise
U overdyed u mustn't  girl to my advice
Get out before I find u again
Bridge, Chorus
Damn right I'm serious
U don't cross me and I've had enough
Of your lies in my eyes
U ain't what you got in your bag baby
I don't want to make a fuss
Get yourself back baby don't disgust
U no you're to great for being this close to the end 
Chorus x3
