<song artist="Robin_Thicke" title="Make_U_Love_Me">
I'm the kind of guy
Who lives life on the edge
The kind of guy you'd wonder
"Is he messin' with my head"
You're tired of going places
You can't scream and shout
Tired of someone saying 
When you can and cant go out
And imma show you how
It feels when its good
You know I do anything
You're boyfriend ever could
(Bridge)
Then your boyfriend ever could
Then your boyfriend ever could
Imma do it better then your boyfriend ever could
(chorus)
Imma make you love me baby
Baby imma show you how
I'll make you love me babe
Baby you gon' want me now
Imma make you love me baby
Baby imma show you how
Imma make you love me baby
Baby you gon' want me now...
I can reach your mind
Fantasies in your head
You could look at me
And see that I'm the man
I'll put a little romance
And some action in your pleasure
You wanted Mr. Big
Mr big is in your hands
And imma show you how
It feels when its good
You know I do it better
Than your boyfriend ever could
(Bridge)
(Chorus)
And I want you
And how I want you to want me
I want you
And yes I want you to want me
I want you
And how I want you to want me
I want you
And yes I want you to want me
I know you've been kissin'
The back of your hand
What you need to do
Is try it on a real man
Put the towels in the dryer
So they warm after the shower
I'm like Bigfoot 
The man your momma said don't exist
(Bridge)
(Chorus)
I'm like big foot
The man your momma said don't exist
I'm like big foot
The man your momma said don't exist
I'm like big foot
The man your momma said don't exist
Don't exist, don't exist.
