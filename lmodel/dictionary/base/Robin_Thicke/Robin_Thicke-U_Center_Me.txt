<song artist="Robin_Thicke" title="U_Center_Me">
Every fog, every rain, every thunder.
On this road, seems like it will never end.
So I stray and I wonder, I don't want to crash again.
And you say, some things never get better,
Some roads never get right.
Sometimes people need more than what's inside.
And I know, that you center me.
And I know, that you center me.
Then one day, I'm the life of the party.
I'm the real thing, I'm your everything.
Then I fall from the grace, from the glory.
I lose all my faith again.
And you say nothings going to be perfect.
Perfects all in your mind, and all these demons
I can't give up this fight.
And I know, that you center me.
And I know, that you center me.
And I know, that you center me.
And I know, that you center me.
When I lose my way, when anger fills my soul.
When I get to high on myself, and when it gets too cold.
Oh I know, you'll bring me back to life.
Oh I know, you'll make it seem alright.
Alright...alright...
And I know, you center me.
And I know, you center me.
And I know, you center me
