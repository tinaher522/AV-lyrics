<song artist="Robin_Thicke" title="Tears_On_My_Tuxedo">
Listen here doll
Be a good girl
Imma tell you something I know about the world
It's the same thing that I've been trying to tell you
Don't make me run around
Run from your blues
Don't make me close my heart on all your bad news
Use your crying eyes wisely and don't push me into a corner
Crazy in the morning, afraid of the night
Stories always changing
Something ain't right
Don't know if its real or fake
I can't trust the pain of your tears on my tuxedo
Tears on my tuxedo
Tears on my tuxedo
Either you're truly scared
Or you've come prepared with your tears on my tuxedo
You got me like I'm Sam Spade try to figure you out
Are you a jewel encrusted falcon or future empty house
I must rely on my instincts cause I can't trust your words or your tears
Anymore
Cause just when we're about to get down to the truth
You start crying bout how life is so cruel to you
And there's nowhere to go but try and console
It ain't working no more
It ain't working no more
Crazy in the morning, afraid of the night
Stories always changing
Something ain't right
Don't know if it's real or fake
I can't take the weight of your tears on my tuxedo
Tears on my tuxedo
Tears on my tuxedo
Either you're truly scared
Or you've come prepared with your tears on my tuxedo
Tears on my tuxedo
Tears on my tuxedo
Either you're truly scared
Or you've come prepared with your tears on my tuxedo
Tears on my tuxedo
I don't know when it's real
I don't know how to feel
You got me right where you want me
Breaking all of my own rules
So listen here doll
Don't turn us into fools
I know I'm the one that put most of those tears on you
And there's no way to change it
But I'm doing the best I can do
I just keep falling for you
Crazy in the morning, afraid of the night
Stories always changing
Something ain't right
Don't know if it's real or fake
I can't trust the pain of your tears on my tuxedo
Tears on my tuxedo
Tears on my tuxedo
Either you're truly scared
Or you've come prepared with your tears
Oh your tears
Oh your tears
Oh your tears on my tuxedo
Tears on my tuxedo
Tears on my tuxedo
Cry all you want to babe
You can cry all you want to babe
