Oooh...
Eah!
Baby girl, where you at?
Got no strings, got men attached
Can't stop that feelin' for long no
Mmmm
You makin' dogs wanna beg
Breaking them off your fancy legs
But they make you feel right at home, now
(Ooooh)
See all these illusions just take us too long
(Ooooh) And I want it bad..
Because you walk pretty,
Because you talk pretty,
'Cause you make me sick 
And I'm not leavin', till you're leavin'
(Ahhh)
Oh I swear there's something when she's pumpin',
Asking for a raise
(Oooh) Well does she want me to carry her home now?
(Oooh) So does she want me to buy her things?
On my house, on my job
On my loot, shoes, my shirt,
My crew, my mind, my father's last name?
(Ahhh)
When I get you alone ('lone)
When I get you you'll know baby (know)
When I get you alone ('lone)
When I get you alone now (it's all mine)
(Ahhhh....oh)
Come on
Oh yeah-yeah
Baby girl you da shit
That makes you my equivalent
Well you can keep your toys in the drawer tonight,
All right
All my dawgs talkin' fast-
Aint you got some photographs?
'Cause you shook that room like a star, now
Yes you did, oh
(Ooooh)
All these intrusions just take us too long
(Ooooh) And I want you so bad..
Because you walk city,
Because you talk city,
'Cause you make me sick 
And I'm not leavin', till you're leavin'
(Ahhh)
So I pray to something she aint bluffin',
Rubbin' up on me
(Oooh) Well does she want me to make a vow?
Check it
(Oooh)Well does she want me to make it now?
On my house, on my job
On my loot, shoes, my voice,
My crew, my mind, my father's last name?
(Ahhh)
When I get you alone ('lone)
When I get you you'll know baby (know)
When I get you alone ('lone)
When I get you alone now (it's all mine)
(Ahhhh....oh)
Oh no
Get you alone baby
Oohh..
Oooh..oh-oh
That a girl!
You get some
(Ahhh)
All these intrusions just take us too long
(Ahhh) And I want you so bad..
Because you walk pretty, (You, you-you)
Because you talk pretty, (You get some)
'Cause you make me sick 
And I'm not leavin', till you're leavin'
(Ahhh)
But I pray to something when she's pumpin',
Rubbin' up on me, now
(Oooh) Want me to break it down?
Check it
(Oooh) Well did you want me to make it now?
On my house, on my job
On my loot, shoes, my voice,
My crew, my mind, my father's last name?
(Ahhh)
When I get you alone ('lone)
When I get you you'll know girl (know)
When I get you alone ('lone)
When I get you alone now (it's all mine)
(Ahhh)
I get you alone ('lone)
When I get you alone (know)
I get you alone ('lone)
When I get you alone (it's all mine)
Yeah
Yeaaahhh.......
