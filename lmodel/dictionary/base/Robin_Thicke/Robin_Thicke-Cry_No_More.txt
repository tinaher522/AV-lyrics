<song artist="Robin_Thicke" title="Cry_No_More">
I met the joker 
And I stole the moon 
I raised the sunshine 
And I have been the fool 
And I have been laughed at 
And I have been lied to 
And I have been left alone, with no answers 
I don't cry, I don't cry no more 
Girl I know you want this 
So I don't try, I don't try no more 
Girl I know you want this 
So I don't lie, I don't lie no more 
Girl I know you want this 
So I don't cry no more 
I took the picture 
and I faced the truth 
I lived a lifetime, a lifetime with you 
now I watch you fall asleep smiling 
and I lie awake 
but there's only so much that one man can take 
So I don't cry, I don't cry no more 
Girl I know you want this 
So I don't try, I don't try no more 
Girl I know you want this 
So I don't lie, I don't lie no more 
Girl I know you want this 
So I don't cry no more 
And I am a hero 
But I'm not made of steel 
And I'm not the smartest man 
But i know the deal 
And I'll bleed for your lips 
If you'll bleed for mine 
And I can't escape it 
Cause I do love you 
I don't cry, I don't cry no more 
Girl I know you want this 
So I don't try, I don't try no more 
Girl I know you want this 
So I don't lie, I don't lie no more 
Girl I know you want this 
So I don't cry no more
 
Girl I know you want this 
So I don't cry, I don't cry no more  
Girl I know you want this 
So I don't cry no more
