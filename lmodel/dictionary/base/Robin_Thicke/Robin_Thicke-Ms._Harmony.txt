<song artist="Robin_Thicke" title="Ms._Harmony">
Funny, it's time... 
Things ain't going right, oh harmony... 
Don't know how you get by! 
Feels like frozen time 
You wake up the moment into your surprise 
You got hope and you're alright 
You're so close and you're so tight 
When the ice melts so right, 
You got a sparkle, baby 
She says you need to be afraid 
You see... age don't matter 
Not you see, it's never to late 
'Cause when you feel love, Ms Harmony 
Oh, you deserve everything you dream 
'cause when you smile at me, ooh harmony 
Heh, you light all the world with your energy 
Oh, baby 
You walk with your head high 
You only take what's right, oh harmony... 
I know just what you need. 
New job, a brand new car 
It feels like you're going far, oh harmony... 
You're a flower in bloom 
Out with the old, in with the new 
Walk away from what all those men did to you 
Now you're light on your feet 
And now every man touch their head, to get a better look 
'Cause when you feel love, Ms Harmony 
Oh, you deserve everything you dream 
'cause when you smile at me, ooh harmony 
Heh, you light all the world with your energy 
Oh, baby 
Da da da da 
Ohh, ehh 
Da da da da 
Oooo, ohhh yeah 
'Cause when you feel love, ooo Harmony 
You deserve everything you dream 
'cause when you smile at me, ooo harmony 
Heh, you light all the world with your energy 
Oh, baby 
Da da da da 
Da da da da
