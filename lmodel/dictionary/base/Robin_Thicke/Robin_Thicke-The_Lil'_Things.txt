<song artist="Robin_Thicke" title="The_Lil'_Things">
Sitting underneath the stars
Holding onto to your hand
Wishing on the miracle
And waiting on the sand
Fallen leaves and fallen dreams
They get back up again
When you stare into my eyes
And I never want it to end
The sounds of the jungle and the blue skies
The Earth underneath my feet and a family to call mine
Oh, it's the little things that always get me by
Yeah, it's the little things, that always makes
Always makes me smile
First words and first hurts
Walking on the shore
Having friends stick by you and
Your backs against the wall
Memories and golden years
The wrongs I've made right
Dancing with the one you love
On New Years Eve
At the stroke of midnight
The sounds of the jungle and the blue skies
The Earth underneath my feet and a family to call mine
Yeah, it's the little things that always get me by
Yeah, it's the little things, that always makes
Always makes me smile
Yeah, it's the little things,
Yeah, it's the little things,
Yeah, it's the little things,
That always make me smile
