<song artist="Robin_Thicke" title="Mrs._Sexy">
Ohhh you; I've been goin' crazy
I want to buy a ring and make you Mrs. Sexy
Want you to have my kids and help you make your next "G" 
Tell me how I can't miss this on beat.
Me and Jay-Z were cooler than ???
Seen an all world cover girl
Hey lady I'm sorry if you're in a rush
Don't let me hold ya up, or intervene or interrupt;
But you got the look, I wanna get to know ya better
I had to let her know, yo I couldn't sweat her
Cause' if you were to see what I was seein'
Almost looked Korean
But European
When she spoke her accent was self-explanatory
Even her body language told a story
Her name was Mahogany, Prince name was Ebony
I said my name was rob, and this is Jay-Z
Baby, aww yeah 
I want you to be my, aww yeah.
Ohhh you; I've been goin' crazy
I want to buy a ring and make you Mrs. Sexy
Want you to have my kids and help you make your next "G" 
Tell me how I can't miss this on beat.
(Repeat x1)
It's funny how times flies when your havin' fun
We got close and it was almost one
She kissed me slow
But you know how far a kiss go
Fuck around and miss the show
So I told her hold that thought real tight
We'll finish where we left on later tonight
In a rise, I knew that she wanted my agony, agony, agony in her body
Baby, oh yeah
I want you to be my, I want you to be my
Ohhh you; I've been goin' crazy
I want to buy a ring and make you Mrs. Sexy
Want you to have my kids and help you make your next "G" 
Tell me how I can't miss this on beat.
(Repeat x1)
Showed her some ??? Then I took her to the condo
She's poppin' ??? but don't know me so well
She asked me how come I don't smile
I said everything's fine
But I'm in a New York state of mind, baby
Yeah, I said everything's fine but I'm in a New York state of mind baby
Oh yeah;
Ohhh you; I've been goin' crazy
I want to buy a ring and make you Mrs. Sexy
Want you to have my kids and help you make your next "G" 
Tell me how I can't miss this on beat.
As we reach the kingdom she said
"Bring some champagne out and entertain then sing some
Sentimental song, real gentle"
It hit the spot then you know where we went to
As we embraced and felt our heart pumpin'
She was in the mood for somethin'...
So I layed back on my back and relaxed
It wasn't the Perion that made me collapse
Ohhh you; I've been goin' crazy
I want to buy a ring and make you Mrs. Sexy
Want you to have my kids and help you make your next "G" 
Tell me how I can't miss this on beat.
(Repeat x1)
Heey,
I want you to be mine (repeat x4)
I want you, to be my
