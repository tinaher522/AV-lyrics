<song artist="Robin_Thicke" title="Something_Else">
i want something else 2x 
i'm a man 
i love my drink 
i like the girls 
i've walked these streets 
but i need a break, some new town 
cause the way it tastes 
it is going down (i say) 
(chorus) 
i want something else 
i love the stuff 
it's never enough 
i want something else 
you know what i need 
just give it to me please 
losing control, i'm about to explode tonight 
i got a girl 
she's tired of this city 
she wants to go where 
she feels pretty (yes) 
she wants a new mind 
sexy all the time 
in the middle of the dinner 
she whispers in my ear (says) 
(chorus) 
i want something else 
i love the stuff 
it's never enough 
i want something else 
you know what i need 
just give it to me please 
i'm losing control, i'm about to explode tonight 
i need to know 8x 
it's never enough 8x 
(chorus 2x) 
i want something else 
i love the stuff 
it's never enough 
i want something else 
you know what i need 
just give it to me please 
i'm losing control, i'm about to explode tonight
