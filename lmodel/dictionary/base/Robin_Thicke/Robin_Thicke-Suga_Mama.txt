<song artist="Robin_Thicke" title="Suga_Mama">
I'd been missin on love it's clear (Oh no)
So she bought me some brand new gear (Oh no)
And she's sending her driver here
I just can't say no to my needs
I feel such a fool when she calls
I can't trust myself
From the picket lines
She's got my love, got my help
Got my control (Oh no)
Got my intentions known
Got me aroused, and it shows
She's a bad girl and you know it
I can see it in her eyes
She's a bad girl, Suga Mama
From the plan she's devised
A bad girl and you know this
Cause the feelings so right
Baby's killin me like a lover should
But I can't let that girl take my life
At times she can't keep her hands on me (Oh no)
But won't public affection me (Oh no)
No daytime congruency -well shit
I can't count on her like she can me now
I feel such a cool when she calls
I can't lust myself
For the sake of my picketing peeps
I try to runs it's just no help

She got me on call ,got my intention grown
Bought me a pound and she rolls
She's a bad girl and you know it
I can see it in her eyes
She's a bad girl, Suga Motha
From the plan she's devised
A bad girl and you know this
Cause the feelings so right
Baby's killin me like a lover should
But I can't let that girl take my life
(Breakdown:)
