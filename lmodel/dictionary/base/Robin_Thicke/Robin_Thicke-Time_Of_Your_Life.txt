<song artist="Robin_Thicke" title="Time_Of_Your_Life">
This is the time of your life
Let's celebrate, not ask each other why
She's standing there beside you, touch her hand let it guide you
She's just looking for somebody to love
This is the moment of your life
Everything's changed, it's all gonna turn out right
We don't know how this little fairy tale ends
Good thing we will always be best friends
Well this is the time of your life
Live it up, drink it down, get up off the ground, take flight
If you practice the right moves, maybe you'll see
Everything fits so perfectly,
It's the time of your life, yes it is
She wants to know if everybody's looking
She doesn't know that she's got that thing
She wants to know if anybody's looking
She doesn't realize
You got that thing baby
You got that thing baby
You got that thing baby
You got that thing baby
You got that thing baby
You got that thing baby
Well I don't know how to spell it or how to say it
But I think they call it you got that it baby
This is the time of your life
Let's celebrate, not ask each other why
He's standing there beside you,
Let his eyes remind you
You're just looking for somebody to love,
Well this is the time of your life
You got that thing baby
You got that thing baby
You got that thing baby
You got that thing baby
You got that thing baby
You got that thing baby
You got that thing baby
You got that thing baby
Special and wonderful, you got it in your soul
If you just let it all go, anything's possible
Anything's possible, yeah the whole world is yours
It's the time of your life, woo
Well I don't know how to spell it or how to say it
But I think they say in Hollywood, you got that it baby,
You got that thing
