(Ladies and gentlemen, The Evolution of Robin Thicke)
I want a fresh girl
I wanna drink my drink
I wanna get high
I can't have everything
I wanna be rich
Never work at all
And sleep all day
And I wanna see it all
Oh I want, I want everything
I want everything I can't have
When the brandy hits my throat I go
Da-da-da-da-da da-da-da da-da
When I see the girls, those girls they make me go
Da-da-da-da-da da-da-da da-da
When I get a taste, a taste it makes me go
Da-da-da-da-da da-da-da da-da
And when that brandy hits my throat I go
Da-da-da-da-da da-da-da da-da
I want a fresh girl
From Dominica
Maybe from Puerto Rico
From Columbia
Breakfast lunch and dinner
I want it all the time
Yo te quiero mucho
Yo hablo espanol
Oh I want, I want everything
I want everything I can't have
When the brandy hits my throat I go
Da-da-da-da-da da-da-da da-da
When I see the girls, those girls they make me go
Da-da-da-da-da da-da-da da-da
When I get a taste, a taste it makes me go
Da-da-da-da-da da-da-da da-da
And when that brandy hits my throat I go
Da-da-da-da-da da-da-da da-da
I want a house and kids
A big family
I want so many women
I can't have everything
