<song artist="Robin_Thicke" title="Dreamworld">
I would be you, you would be me, we would be one, we would be just fine 
The ice caps wouldn't be melting and neither would I, mmh 
I would just drive my big old car, and everything would be alright 
And energy would just fall down right from the sky, yeah 
Words would fly right from out of my mind, out of my mind into your heart, into your life 
And everything would sound just right, and no one would stop me from drinking my wine 
That's my dreamworld, that's my dreamworld, it's more than a dream 
My dreamworld, that's my dreamworld, and I wanna live in my dream, (dream) 
For the real world just don't feel right 
I wouldn't spend my days searching for, searching for lost time, yeah hey yee (ooh ooh, dream) 
I wouldn't be so damn sensitive, I'd let things go by 
No matter what the weather, I'd learn to change, I'd change with the time, yeah he 
And everytime I need a woman, she'd appear right by me 
she hold me tight, treat me right, and tell me that everything is gonna be, is gonna be alright, alright 
That's my dreamworld, that's my dreamworld 
I would tell Van Gogh that he was loved, there's no need to cry 
I would say Marvin Gay your father didn't want you to die (dream) 
There would be no black and white, the world just treat my wife right 
We could down in Mississipi and no one would look at us trice, ehhe he 
That's my dreamworld, that's my dreamworld, it's more than a dream 
That's my dreamworld, that's my dreamworld, and I wanna live in my dream, (dream)
