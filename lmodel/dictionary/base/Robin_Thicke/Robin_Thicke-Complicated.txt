<song artist="Robin_Thicke" title="Complicated">
I wish I could change
I wish I could change
I wish I could stop
Sayin' the same old things
I wish I could be
Who you want me to be
I wish I could stop
Being the same old me
I wish I could lose
All of my blues
I wish I could stop
Puttin' my blues on you
I wish I could love
Like nobody loves
I wish that my goods
Outweighed my bads enough
There's no way, there's no way, there's no way
I can get back that girl
'Cause I'm too complicated
And she's not complicated
But I'm too complicated
I wish I could change
I wish I could change
I wish I could stop
Placin' the blame
I can't stop it
I can't break down
I can't drop it, can't see how
I wish I could lose
All of my blues
I wish I could stop
Puttin my blues on you
I wish I could love
I wish that my goods
Outweighed my bads enough
You know its killin' me
Baby how can I let you go
Suddenly there's nothing I need more
There's no way, there's no way, there's no way
I can get back that girl
