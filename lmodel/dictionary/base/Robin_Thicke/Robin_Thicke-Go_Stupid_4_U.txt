Oh, damn!
Oh, damn! (Oh damn!)
Ooh, damn! (Damn!)
Ooooh, damn!
Girl you know I'm looking at you
Something like an angel when you're walking on by
Sexy from the front, a-ha
Sexy from the back, a-ha
Grab my cardiac, oh my...
Give a boy a heart attack call the ambulance
Girl I fell in love, a-ha
Give the boy a chance
And you know I would
I can't stop girl
Every time you walking down the block
Girl talking tender lovely
You're so hot girl, ooooh
Girl I go stupid for you
Yeah I get stupid, get stupid
I know it I know it
I get stupid, get stupid
I show it, I show it
When you're walking by my way
Every time I see you is a lovely day
And I can't get you out my mind girl
The first time I layed'em on you all I wanna do is sing
Oh, damn! (Oh damn!)
Oh, damn! (Oh damn!)
Ooh, damn! (Oh damn!)
Ooooh, damn!
Girl I wrote a song about you
Designed a little part that reminds me of your ass
Sexy from the back, a-ha
Give me some of that, a-ha
Girl I'd love to sing your song
Girl I'd really love to sing all night long
On and on and on, for sure
It goes a little something like this
I can't stop girl
Every time you walking down the block
Girl talking tender lovely
You're so hot girl, ooooh
Girl I go stupid for you
I can't stop girl
Every time you walking down the block
Girl talking tender lovely
You're so hot girl, ooooh
Girl I go stupid for you
Yeah I get stupid, get stupid
I know it I know it
I get stupid, get stupid
I show it, I show it
When you're walking by my way
Every time I see you is a lovely day
And I can't get you out my mind girl
The first time I layed'em on you all I wanna do is sing
Oh, damn! (Oh damn!)
Oh, damn! (Oh damn)
Ooh, damn! (Oh, damn!)
Ooooh, damn!
Yeah I get stupid, get stupid
I know it I know it
I get stupid, get stupid
I show it, I show it
Yeah I get stupid, get stupid
I know it I know it
I get stupid, get stupid
I show it, I show it
