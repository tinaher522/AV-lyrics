<song artist="Robin_Thicke" title="Lovely_Lady">
There you go, walking by there 
You are the apple of my eye 
And I see you coming towards me and 
I get this sweating butterflies and 
You should know it 
You've got to feel it 
I'm in love with you for really 
I have got to have you tonight 
If you knew how cute you looked in your tight dress 
And your high heels 
Understand why I get caught up staring at you everytime 
You pass me by I see your eyes 
I feel your hair 
I see you smile 
I just wish that you could 
See me too 
Walking at the beach together 
Hand in hand 
Let me paint the picture 
You can see it 
Now whatever 
You will now will get somehow 
What do you want to drive baby 
What do you want to eat tonight baby 
I have got to have you tonight 
There she goes my pretty baby 
There she goes my lovely lady 
I need her to know 
I need her for life [2x]
There she goes walking by there 
She caught my eye 
She's looking at me 
I tell her I'll leave you never 
She thinks I am oh so clever 
Know baby I am telling the truth 
I am the only one for you 
I will love you until the end of time
