<song artist="Robin_Thicke" title="Brand_New_Jones">
Some like to keep heat on
Some never hot enough
See I sleep with nothing on
'cause I'm always burnin up
But we all wanna try
To see each other's side
And I'll try
Til she takes my pillow
mmm
She'll say I'm lucky
She'll say I'm the man
We'll talk on for hours 
As long as I understand
I'd go on without her
see see
but everyday
ain't the same 
ain't the same 
ain't the same 
I feel like a puppy
when I get time to play
I've got a brand new jones
And nobody even knows
When my baby is gone
It's my thang, my thang
Sometimes I can't let go
So I've got to be alone
When my baby is gone
It's my thang, my thang alone
Some like a sweet romance
and some wanna travel far
but I like a three point stance
and I hate to drive my car
But I'd go round the world
Just to please my girl
and I'll fly
if she takes my pillow
Ooh
She'll say I'm lucky
Then say I'm the man
We'll talk on for hours 
As long as I understand
I'd go on without her
but everyday
I feel like a puppy
when I get time to play
I've got a brand new jones
And nobody even knows

When my baby is gone
It's my thang, yeah, my thang
Sometimes I can't let go
So I've got to be alone
When my baby is gone
It's my thang my thang alone
So why don't I just 
save time and reveal now
'cause sooner or later she'll
know the deal
She'll wonder why
the bed jumps so high
when she sleeps at night
oh yeah yeah
oooh
Tells me I'm lucky
Then say I'm the man
We'll talk on for hours
As long as I understand
I'd go on without it
see see
but everyday
I.. no... 
ain't the same
ain't the same
I feel like a puppy 
When I get time to play
I've got a brand new jones
And nobody even knows
When my baby is gone
It's my thang, my thang
Sometimes I can't let go
So I've got to be alone
When my baby is gone
It's my thang my thang alone
I've got this brand new jones
Leave me on my own
Love love baby
you know it
I've got this brand new jones
Leave me on my own
Love love baby
you know it
I've got this brand new jones
Leave me on my own
Love love baby
you know it
