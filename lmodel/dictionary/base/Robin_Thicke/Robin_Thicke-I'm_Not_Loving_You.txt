<song artist="Robin_Thicke" title="I'm_Not_Loving_You">
Through the rain girl
I found jesus
I found you and 
I know nothing can take your place girl
Your red lipstick
And i'm just afraid
Cause this is the first time
That i'm not loving you
And i'm not loving you
I got married to the idea
To the notion
That youd always be here with me girl 
Like my shadow
And I wish I was there
Just to run my hands through your hair
And i'm just afraid
Cuz this is the first time
That i'm not loving you
And i'm not loving you
Girl you know i'm always thinking of you
Haven't seen the summer since I saw you
Baby don't worry 'bout us
I feel your love
I feel you inside
And I wish I was there
Just to run my hands through your hair
And i'm just afraid
Cause this is the first time
That i'm not loving you
And i'm not loving you
Girl i'm not loving
And i'm not loving you
Girl you know i'm always thinking of you
Haven't seen the summer since I saw you
Baby don't worry bout us
I feel your love
I feel you inside baby
Girl i'm not loving you
You...
