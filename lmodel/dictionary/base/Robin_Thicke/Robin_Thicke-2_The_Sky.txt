<song artist="Robin_Thicke" title="2_The_Sky">
It's amazing the way the darkness falls
And the truth out there is cold
And nothing to keep you warm
Jealousy and lies within me
I got a feeling the sun won't shine today
And I gotta to know right now
Will I be rich, have everything I want
I stop myself and look to the sky
Oh, I got to give myself up to the sky
The only truth is in the sky
Nobody else can tell 'cause I'm stuck in a spell
Of greed and anger and hate
Oh, I tried, I tried, I tried to rise above it
But it comes right back
Creeps up on me and it hits me
Double time
This can't be my fate
It's never too late
I wake up holding on to this pain
And there's nothing else I can do
But to give myself up to the sky
When you ask yourself
Hey why me and why not me?
When you're down on your knees
Look to the sky
Just look to the sky
You don't need no faster car
Or no bigger house
All you really need is friends and love
Hey come on home
Just throw up your hands
Throw up your heart
All you really need is love
I'm comin' home
So come on home
