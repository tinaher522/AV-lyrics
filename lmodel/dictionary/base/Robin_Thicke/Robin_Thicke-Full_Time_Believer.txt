<song artist="Robin_Thicke" title="Full_Time_Believer">
She's the girl you see
Walking down the street
Holding her head high
Unstoppable
She's confident
Got a laser eye
Swinging to her own beat
and an A+ smile
She's a winner
Ooo
She is where it's at
She's the loins meow
She can stop the whole crowd
She is Heaven lent
'Cause I know they want her back
She's a full time believer
She wakes up early everyday
Yeah 'cause she's a
Full time believer
and she can care less what you say
Yeah 'cause she's a
Full time believer
Don't you get in her way
She combs her hair
With her diamond eyes
Staring at herself
'Cause she looks so fly
She can't help but show it
She's got that glow
And you know it, and I know it, and they know it
She's the rarest wine
An astrological find
and when she stretches on by
She blows my mind
She don't need nobody
I only wish she was
All mine...
She's a full time believer
She wakes up early everyday
Yeah 'cause she's a
Full time believer
and she can care less what you say
Yeah 'cause she's a
Full time believer
Everyday...
She lays in bed
With a real hard book
'Bout a Chinese girl
and a chance she took
She defined all odds
Maybe wrote the law
Oh, her daddy would be proud
If he was still around
She turns the light off
and dreams of Kings and gold
Can't touch her soul
Or keep her under control
She's a leader to be
Something you're gonna see
she made me a,
A full time believer
Now I get up early everyday
I'm trying to be a,
A full time believer
I'm hoping that for me you will pray
I want to be a,
A full time believer
Everyday
