[Mary J. Blige:]
I can the pain dissapear
And I can erase the past
I can make the future shine so bright
And I can make right now alright
[Chorus:]
I got it, you got it
We got that magic girl [x4]
[Robin Thicke:]
All I got is concrete all around me
But I can see the country side
You can be rich when you're poor
Poor when you're rich
It can be raining and I can make the sun shine
[Chorus]
[Robin Thicke:]
I know sometimes sometimes you feel no hope
But I've been there upon that lonely road
I took whatever gift he offered me
Because I knew that he would set me free
[Chorus]
[Robin Thicke:]
Science they can't prove it
But I know can do it
[Mary J. Blige:]
I can fly
I can bend metal with my mind
[Both:]
I can wake up in paridise
[Robin Thicke:]
We got that magic [x6]
[Chorus: fade]
