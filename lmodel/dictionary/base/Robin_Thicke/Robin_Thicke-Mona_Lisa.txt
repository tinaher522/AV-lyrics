<song artist="Robin_Thicke" title="Mona_Lisa">
I'm 'A drive you crazy
Till you be my baby
'Cause your giving me the signs.
Its just a matter of time, till your mine.
So you stay on my mind,
24/7 on my mind.
And I keep reading into every one of your moves,
Every little thing you do,
Thinking, should I pursue you?
Should I pursue you?
So I start making plans.
Take you out to slow dance.
Light up a romance.
Wrap your hands in my hands.
Then I hold you.
We get closer.
And I want you.
And I want to drive you crazy, love.
How can I just let go,
If your eyes say yes, but you won't fall in love?
If I were a painter, you'd be my mona lisa.
If I were a scientist baby, Id find the right chemistry.
So you say yes to me, and I keep hanging on, hanging on.
Till you say yes to me, say yes to me, say yes.
I'm 'A drive you crazy
Till you be my baby
I will drive you crazy
Till you be my baby
So I'm back in my room.
Yesterday's ended too soon, way too soon.
Staring at the canvas, watching the time pass by.
I got all the wrong colors spread out around me.
My glass of champagne is almost empty.
Every stroke I make is a stroke on your body.
Run my mind through your hair, its only you I see.
So I start making plans.
Take you out to slow dance.
Light up a romance.
Wrap your hands in my hands.
Then I hold you.
We get closer.
And I want you.
And I'm gonna drive you crazy love.
How can I just let go,
If your eyes say yes, but you won't fall in love?
If I were a painter, you'd be my mona lisa.
If I were a scientist baby, Id find the right chemistry.
So you say yes to me, and I keep hanging on, hanging on.
Till you say yes to me, say yes to me, say yes.
I'm 'A drive you crazy
Till you be my baby
I will drive you crazy
Till you be my baby
I'm 'A drive you crazy
Till you be my baby
I will drive you crazy
Till you be my baby
