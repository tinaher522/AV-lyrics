<song artist="Robin_Thicke" title="Angels">
All the things I've done before this
They don't mean a thing
And all the words spoken before this
Won't be said again
Suddenly so much of me has
No need to pretend
'Cause there's nothing like the truth
To bring her back to you
And everyone I've met before this
Ain't seen me with you
Angel, angel, angel
Angel, my angel, my angel
You're the only one who knows what I go through
Sometimes you even feel it more than me, baby
And I don't know how I ever got by without you
There's nothing like the truth
And I've got nothing left to lose
And every night I thank the universe that I found you
Angel, my angel, my angel
And I don't have to wonder
What the world thinks about me
I know you're in my corner
You're always surrounding me
With your love
And if we all explode
See we would never know
But I just hope the pieces of my soul
Reach out to you to find my angel
My angels, my angels
Angels, my angels
My angels
