[Robin Thicke]
Meiple,
I like to play cheek to cheek,
2 kids in the sandbox baby,
You remind me of St Tropez,
Sandy beaches, and yachts yeh and champagne,
Tuxedos and Jet Ski's babe,
I lay you down at the georges cinq babe,
And baby when we dream, when we dream,
When we dream, we be dreaming in French baby,
[Chorus]
Meiple,
Imma treat ya like a lady
You can be my pretty baby,
We can spend all my money baby,
Cheek to cheek girl, meiple
Imma treat you just like a lady
You can be my pretty baby
We can spend all my money baby
(Jay-Z)
I know you wanna,(fuck)
I know you wanna,(fuck)
I know you wanna,(say Fuck)
I know you wanna,(oui,oui)
Hold up,
No Habla Ingle,
Cos me I play,
St Tropez down inÂ ?,
Yacht docked not far away,
Black Brigitte Bardot Beyonce,
Avantgarde, lanvin socks
Call me Picasso, Im art on yachts,
Pardon me, oui, in Paris,
Champagne spilling out of my oui oui (wee wee),
Pardon my French, the je ne sais quoi got me on cloud 9
We finna take off, Paris was a tease now we in the Maldives,
Sipping Blanco smoking on tea leaves,
Isn't this great, strawberry Crepes,
Down in Capri in the Grotto we play,
Up next Sardinia, me and little Tina,
Turn up, tell me have you seen us,
Enough,
[Chorus]
Meiple,
Imma treat ya like a lady
You can be my pretty baby,
We can spend all my money baby,
Cheek to cheek girl, meiple
Imma treat you just like a lady
You can be my pretty baby
We can spend all my money baby
I know you wanna,(fuck)
I know you wanna,(fuck)
I know you wanna,(say fuck)
(oui,oui)oui,
[Robin Thicke]
Me I play, I take you to the lead brasserie,
We take a show at the crazy horse,
They got nothing on you
Because like the Eiffel Tower
You can take me to the highest babe,
Like a lady, I take you shopping at Chanel babe,
Afternoon tea for two at the Ritz babe,
My lady don't lift things, open doors, stand alone,
Not when she with me baby,
[Chorus]
Meiple,
Imma treat ya like a lady
You can be my pretty baby,
We can spend all my money baby,
Cheek to cheek girl, meiple
Imma treat you just like a lady
You can be my pretty baby
We can spend all my money baby
I know you wanna,
You remind me of Monaco babe,
Mt Blanc princess Grace babe
Racking chips in Monte Carlo babe,
Be my million dollar baby,
By the end of the trip you be a Billion dollar lady,
Wrap you up babe, in a cote azur rose babe,
French country side steps of cannes babe,
I can pay for acting lessons,
You become a movie star make more than me babe,
[Chorus 2x]
Meiple,
Imma treat ya like a lady
You can be my pretty baby,
We can spend all my money baby,
Cheek to cheek girl, meiple
Imma treat you just like a lady
You can be my pretty baby
We can spend all my money baby
I know you wanna
[Jay-Z]
Uh ha
Thats right
Uh ha
Thats right
I know you wanna
I know you wanna
I know you wanna
I know you wanna
