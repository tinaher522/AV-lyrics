<song artist="Robin_Thicke" title="Got_2_Be_Down">
All this love and aggravation
I wasted so much of my life
All this truth and separation
We work so hard to make things right
Got that lovin' got that seed
Got that suga' got that sweet
Got that money got that beat
Got that whatever you need
Oh, I can't hide it you're my world
Got me thinking I'm no good
Chocolate lover youre so sweet
Got me thinkin' on my feet
There'll be no problems to get out of
I got to be down
And amazing or Ill go crazy
In this house
I got to be down
You were always number one to me
Even when I cursed your name
And if I could
I would've been gone
But nothing's like being in love with you
Got that lovin' got that seed
Got that suga' got that sweet
Got that money got that beat
Got that whatever you need
Oh, I can't hide it you're my world
Got me thinking I'm no good
Chocolate lover youre so sweet
Got me thinkin' on my feet
There'll be no problems to get out of
I got to be down
And amazing or I'll go crazy
In this house
I got to be down
We gotta get it together, we gotta stick together
We gotta stay together, we gotta get it together
