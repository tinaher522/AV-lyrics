<song artist="Robin_Thicke" title="Ooo_La_La">
You came and soaked that day
I fell in love that day
You gave me love that day
I'm thinking up that day
You gave me some that day
I fell in love that day
Can't enough that day
I'm thinking up that day
To meet out in rose, stays by her man
She was a party, she loved to dance
Won't raise me voice, won't raise my hand
Keep telling your story, I understand
You can have my money
You can have my money
You can have my soul if you want it too
You can come upon it
I wanna solve it,
Cause I can't get over you
You came and soaked that day
I fell in love that day
You gave me love that day
I'm thinking up that day
You gave me some that day
I fell in love that day
Can't enough that day
I'm thinking up that day
Took a lot of time
See through my desguise
We first to carry, electrified
Keep me to the cup, I keep hating on
You make me peak, but you make it strong
You can have my money
You can have my money
You can have my soul if you want it too
You can come upon it
I wanna solve it,
Cause I can't get over you
Stop all other walls
Chicker than pill walls
Rose waterfalls
There's enough bedroom
Less more open rooms
The world is mine as long as I'm with you
Ooo la la
You came and soaked that day
I fell in love that day
You gave me love that day
I'm thinking up that day
You gave me some that day
I fell in love that day
Can't enough that day
I'm thinking up that day
You can have my money
You can have my money
You can have my soul if you want it too
You can come upon it
I wanna solve it,
Cause I can't get over you
You can have my money
You can have my money
You can have my soul if you want it too
You can come upon it
I wanna solve it,
Cause I can't get over you
You came and soaked that day
I fell in love that day
You gave me love that day
I'm thinking up that day
You gave me some that day
I fell in love that day
Can't enough that day
I'm thinking up that day
You came and soaked that day
I fell in love that day
You gave me love that day
I'm thinking up that day
You gave me some that day
I fell in love that day
Can't enough that day
I'm thinking up that day
Ooo la la
Ooo la la
Ooo la la
Ooo la la
