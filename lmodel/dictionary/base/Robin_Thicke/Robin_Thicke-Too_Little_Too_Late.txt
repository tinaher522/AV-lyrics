<song artist="Robin_Thicke" title="Too_Little_Too_Late">
Too little too late
Too little too late
Too little too late
Every time you walked through that door
I should've held you so long
You would never ever need to ask for more
Every time you walked through that door
I should've spun you around and around
Like the kitchen was the dance floor
Every time you walked through that door
Should've listened, fixed it,
Kissed it, healed it, not belittled it
Every time you walked up in this house baby
Should've made you feel special and treated you right
Don't you say it baby,
Don't you say it, say it, say it now
I'm down on my knees baby,
Baby baby please
Too little too late
Too little too late
Too little too late
I love you baby too little too late
Every time you walked through that door
Should've brought white roses, good and plenty, and rubbed your toses
Every time you walked up in this house baby
Shoulda woulda coulda, should've show some respect
Don't you say it baby,
Don't you say it, say it, say it now
Don't say its too late
Baby baby please
Too little too late
Too little too late
Too little too late
I love you baby too little too late
Every time you walk through that door
Should've waited patient, thanked you, spanked you, pleased you, feed you
Every time you walked up in this house baby
Should've cheered you, feared you,
Knew a day would never come when I don't need you
Don't say it's too late,
Don't you leave me, leave me lonely
Don't say it's too late,
Oh my lord
I've been left down on my knees,
I'm begging you please baby
I'm willing to wait for you baby,
Baby baby please
Too little too late
Too little too late
Too little too late
I love you baby, baby baby please
