<song artist="Robin_Thicke" title="Cherry_Blue_Skies">
White man's killing the black man
black man's chasing the red
war in these streets
no talkin bout peace
the dog's off the leash, under pressure
all of this violence
and hate crime is rising
the world ain't the same as it was 
Ahh..
But it's never too late to try
To get on the same side
Get on the same side
It's cherry blue skies
where theres cherry blue skies
Everything's a struggle
But freedom's worth a fight
and love is still the answer at all times
your friends and lovers
your sisters and brothers
all love the same from the moon
But it's never too late to try
to get on the same side
get on the same side
it's cherry blue skies 
where there's cherry blue skies
It's never gonna be to late to try
a place where theres hope
a place where theres peace
it's never to late to try
for the cherry blue skies
