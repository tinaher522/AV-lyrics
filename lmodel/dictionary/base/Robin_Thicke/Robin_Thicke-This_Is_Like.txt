<song artist="Robin_Thicke" title="This_Is_Like">
This is like riding through the city
With the ocean in the background
This is like riding in Paris with your girl sitting up
B-side, baby parlay
Waterfront top back, coupe with a fade
Tonight is ours, paper city, red ruby
You looking fine, as beautiful as one could ever be
Tires spinning, fast cars, fast women
And I just wanna get a night with a happy ending
The yacht life, hear the splash, so much class
Lift your glass, make a toast, we around the map
His and hers, Hermes bags, left the tag
All real love shit, with a scrub
Chillin' on top, get away, just a flight
Living life, this is what it's like.
This is like riding through the city
With the ocean in the background
This is like riding in Paris with your girl sitting up
She's so relentless, body of a goddess
Gotta take her higher
Rain through my window pane, she the fire to my flame
Good aim, put your heart where the sky is
It's cold down there but it's lonely up here
The world's so cold you gonna need a moncler
Ma stare, when I look at you it's all clear
Tryna keep it together and ball like Rothstein
4-Seas, car clean,
I'm from the go-era, my jewels is
A party ain't a party if it ain't all night
This is like riding through the city
With the ocean in the background
This is like riding in Paris with your girl sitting up
