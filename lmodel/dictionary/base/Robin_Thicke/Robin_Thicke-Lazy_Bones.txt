<song artist="Robin_Thicke" title="Lazy_Bones">
I'm taking time out for reflecting 
I'm going one on one with who I'd like to be 
I'm leaning towards the sun 
Watching flowers blossom all around me 
I tried wailin' to a wall 
Standin' like porcelain, mumblin', 
Salt water rollin' down side burns, 
Searchin' for the answers, handling the truth 
Seein' it for myself is the only way 
Forget a winner, stop being a sinner first 
Ruining your liver, smoking cigarettes and worse 
Love is a killer, the leading cause of suicide 
How to survive a day in the life of times 
(chorus) 
I'll rock the vote not to hear you 
Tell me that I'm watching too much T.V. 
Then I'll hope that I can win with the lazy bones I'm livin' in 
It's not my fault I wasn't chosen 
I was focused in the open 
I deserve so much better than this 
I'm shooting airballs from the free-throw line 
I'm batting lefty when I know that I'm alright 
I'm reaching out for the sun 
Being passed by shooting stars overnight 
I been livin' with a small inner child 
Antsy, I can't sit still for a minute 
My shortage of concentration ruins meditation 
And my motivation ain't shit 
I need a way 
My tolerance ain't what it used to be 
Dollars make sense sellin' out for a fee 
If I didn't have faith, could you still save me? 
How to survive the lines we hate to lead 
(chorus) 
F**k the future 
I'm in the present plague 
Can't be a loser, my girl won't stay 
I don't know computers, I was sick that day 
How to survive the mines we chose to lay 
alright... 
(chorus 3x)
