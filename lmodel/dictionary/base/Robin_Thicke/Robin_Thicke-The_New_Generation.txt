<song artist="Robin_Thicke" title="The_New_Generation">
We're the new generation 
The new generation 
And we believe now 
We believe (we believe) 
(we believe)
It's a televised revolution 
We want democracy
We fight all the pressure 
We tired of murder and grief
We want our freedom
Like the Statue of Liberty 
We want to see our children
Live better than you and me
The whole city is a dance floor 
(huh) It's a celebration 
For the whole world to see
Things are really changing 
From Africa to Asia 
Through Europe cross the seas
Everybody's got they hand up
And nobody's on their knees
And the bombs will stop flying 
And we gaze a quiet sky 
And we stand in love and wonder
At the miracle gone by
And it ain't like it used to be 
Cause it's better than it was 
We're the new generation 
We believe in us (we believe) 
We believe in us (we believe) 
We're the new new [x3] We believe in us [x3]
The new generation 
Now we're sharing our money
Now we helping tough lives 
Now we calling up our brothers 
Saying I apologize 
Love is stronger than eternity
Love's in every baby's eyes 
We crawling outta that dirty gutta
With tuxedos on your mind 
You want a glass of champagne 
You want it paid for by the pain 
Shout your national anthem 
For all your countrymen that died in vain
You're the new prince ruler 
The red dog Cairo king
An international inspiration
The number one topic most trending 
And now the bombs will stop flying
And we gaze a quiet sky 
And we stand in love and wonder
At the miracle gone by
And it ain't like it used to be 
Cause it's better than it was 
We're the new generation 
We believe in us (we believe) 
We believe in us (we believe) 
We're the new new [x3] We believe in us [x3]
The new generation 
Now you can't get between us 
We're connected like mother and child 
It's a world wide network
You better logon before you die
Cause the old god is over 
And the new ray is baptized 
And now we're storming through the palace 
Singing, dancing, you know why
Waving peace flags on the balcony 
Yeah we just changed history
And we all joined hands 
And thank god for listening 
And the bombs will stop flying 
And we gaze a quiet sky 
And we stand in love and wonder
At the miracle gone by
And it ain't like it used to be 
Cause it's better than it was 
We're the new generation 
We believe in us (we believe) 
We believe in us (we believe) 
We believe in us (we believe)
We believe in us (we believe)
We believe in us (we believe)
We're the new new [x3] We believe in us [x3]
The new generation
