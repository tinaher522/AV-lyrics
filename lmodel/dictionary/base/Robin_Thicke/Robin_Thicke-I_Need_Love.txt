<song artist="Robin_Thicke" title="I_Need_Love">
Settle down love for a minute
I wanna take you by the hand and hold you
I've waited so many nights
To see you
And I wanna take out all my problems on you
I can do better than make love to you
Better than make you say my name
Please, please, please
Oh don't you make me have to beg
I need love, love, love, love, love
I need love, love, love, love, love
Angel won't you slow down
Seems like you're always packing and unpacking again
And I now that the hardest thing is to please you
You would bring most men to their knees
I can do better than make love to you
Better than make you scream my name
Please, please, please
Ohh don't you make me have to beg
'Cause I need love, love, love, love, love
I need love, love, love, love
I can do better than make love to you
Better than make you say my name
Please, please, please
Ohh don't you make me have to beg
'Cause I need love, love, love, love, love
I need love, love, love, love
'Cause I need love, love, love, love, love
I need love, love, love, love
Please, please, please
Please, please, please
I need love, love, love, love
I need love
