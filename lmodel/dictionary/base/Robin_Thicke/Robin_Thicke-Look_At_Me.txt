<song artist="Robin_Thicke" title="Look_At_Me">
It feels like you don’t need me anymore
I used to be the answer and the cure
I used to be the life you thought for sure and oh you’re sure on me now
And even though the sun is shining the raging fires are slowly dying
My walls have got me rattling my cage
Look at me look at me again
Set me free Look at me again
I thought you would protect me from the loneliness and shame
but now I see its part of who I was and who I am
and you being gone reminds me of nobody being there
Oh I’m sure
And even though your eyes are shining I cant stop my own from crying
I cant stop what’s running through my head
Look at me look at me again
Set me free Look at me again
I can’t
Girl you don’t have to worry I won’t get in your way
I just want to be with you and I just want to hold you
I just want to be next to you every morning
When you look into my eyes you see everything I hide
and if I’ve changed or am I still the same
Look at me look at me again
Look at me save me set me free look at me
Girl I want to be with you want to hold you want to be with you in the morning
I miss you I miss you so much baby
