<song artist="Robin_Thicke" title="What_Would_I_Be?">
Oh yeah yeah,
What would I
What would I be
Without you lovin me
Id be bad and sad and lonley
Tryin to get you back to me
Ohh, I wake up every morning
The same things, troubling my mind
I say to myself, come on now
It's only just a matter of time
But the cold winds blow
And the hard rains fall
And there's only one reason
I can stand through it all
[Chorus:]
What would I
What would I
What would I be
Without you lovin me
Simply put, I'm all messed up
Selfishness and guilt got in my blood
And I'm tryin baby (tryin so hard)
Trying to clean myself up...
But with out you
I'm so blue
Seeing red
Thinking bad
Nightmares, morning sweats
Foolish regrets
[Chorus:]
What would I
What would I
What would I be
Without you lovin me
Just when I think I can't make it
Oh you kiss me on the lips
You say don't you worry baby
You're the one, the only one
To silence the clouds, and bring out the sun
The only one that makes me makes, me feel like I can be someone
(Yeah, oooh)
Come on now
What would I
What would I
What would I be
Oh yeah yeah
What would I
What would I
What would I be without your love
Id be bad and sad and lonley
Id be so bad and so sad and so lonley
Only tryin to get you back to me baby
Tryin to get you back to my love
Tryin to get you back to my heart
