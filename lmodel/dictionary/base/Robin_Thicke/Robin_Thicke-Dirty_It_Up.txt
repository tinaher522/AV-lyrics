<song artist="Robin_Thicke" title="Dirty_It_Up">
You wanna be a movie star
Dripped with gold and ice
You wanna go around the world
Run from your poltergeist
And look like a supermodel
Driving a big black car
When you strut down through Manhattan
Everyone knows who you are
And you've been keeping secrets
You wanna do naughty things
Just watched some french movie
And now you wanna fuck in the rain
Maybe you want somebody to watch us
Or let someone in
Do you want me to touch you slow
Or do you want to get rough again
Baby, I can give you everything
You'd be set but i'm a freak
And i need you to be freaky with me too
Your the one, I can take to momma
But when'd we'd get home you'd know
What I need when we up in the sheets
Come on lets
Dirty it up (8x)
You got it now
It gets harder everyday 
To keep a smile up on my face
But I've learned I know the way
With you up in my place
And theres nothing i won't do
Then try my best for you
Lets take off what were wearin'
And get screamin' and cryin' and swearin'
You wanna play secretary
Want me to be the boss 
You give me what i need 
I give you what you want
Baby, I can give you everything you deserve
You'd be set but i'm a freak
And i need you to be freaky with me too
Your the one, I can take to momma
But when'd we'd get home you'd know
What I need when we up in the sheets
Baby lets
Dirty it up (8x)
You got it now
It gets harder everyday 
To keep a smile up on my face
But I've learned I know the way
With you up in my place
And theres nothing i won't do
Then try my best for you
Lets take off what were wearin'
And get screamin' and cryin' and swearin'
Dirty it up 
You got it now
