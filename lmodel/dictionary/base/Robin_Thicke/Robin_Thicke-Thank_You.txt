<song artist="Robin_Thicke" title="Thank_You">
For the tears I thank you and
For the songs I cried
For this magic I had no idea why
But I still believe that 
The miracles in time
At this moment I'm doing alright
And I'm overcome w/ joy
Maybe I'm the one who's gonna be here afterall
Maybe I'm the one who's gonna make it afterall
Maybe I'm the one who never gets up til he falls
And I thank you
I know it ain't the first time
I fallen to my knees
Now I'm sending myself the right things
And I can change the past and future just as fast
If we all believe, we can all do that
There's so much more
We can all do so much more
Maybe I'm the one who's gonna make it afterall
Maybe I'm the one who's gonna be here afterall
Maybe I'm the one who never gets up til he falls
And I thank you
I thank you
You know that I do
For the tears I thank you and 
For the songs I cried
For this magic 
I don't know why
But I'm overcome with joy
I'm overcome with joy
Maybe I'm the one who's gonna be here afterall
Maybe I'm the one who's gonna make it afterall
Maybe I'm the one who never gets up til he falls
And I thank you, I thank you, I thank you
