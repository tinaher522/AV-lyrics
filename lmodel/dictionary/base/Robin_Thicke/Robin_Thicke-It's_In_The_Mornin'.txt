<song artist="Robin_Thicke" title="It's_In_The_Mornin'">
I'm in the mood for lovin'
We'll be touchin', we'll be huggin'
I'm in the mood for lovin'
We'll get into...
It's in the morning I wanna touch 
It's in the morning I wanna love you 
It's in the morning no interruptions 
It's in the morning, sex in the morning 
It's in the morning I wanna touch 
It's in the morning I wanna love you
It's in the morning no interruptions 
Sex in the morning, sex in the morning 
You know I love it first thing 
'Cause you just let it marinate, let it marinate 
I'll wait for you to open your eyes 
Look at me and smile 
You know what I want do 
You slowly pull down the sheets to reveal what you keeping wide 
I cant push sleeping anymore and you got the hottest body 
I got the hottest hottie 
Let me put some cream in your coffee
It's in the morning I wanna touch (Yeah) 
It's in the morning I wanna love you (I wanna love you) 
It's in the morning no interruptions 
It's in the morning, sex in the morning 
It's in the morning I wanna touch (I wanna touch you) 
It's in the morning I wanna love you (I wanna love you) 
It's in the morning no interruptions (Ooo) 
Sex in the morning, sex in the morning (Sex in the morning) 
Spin this, bubble like a chemist
Baby said she been a menace, like Dennis 
So I'm up in this, racket like a tennis 
Don't interrupt me baby boo 'cause I ain't finished 
Real spendin', feel how I'm gettin' it 
You girlfriends is jealous 'cause Boss Dogg ain't hittin' it 
Early in the morning makin' breakfast in the kitchen 
After ya finished you 'bout to get the dinin'
I'm in the mood for lovin' we'll get into 
It's in the morning
 
Handle ya business 
Physical with the fitness 
Can I get a witness 
Tremendous, splendid 
Ya hittin' it and bitten it 
Done that, been there 
Out that, In there Yea 
Your sex in the morning, it feels so good 
Your sex in the morning, it feels so good 
And I'm so horny for your body girl 
Wrap your legs around my back 
Get it get it yup yup, you got it girl 
It's in the morning I wanna touch 
It's in the morning I wanna love you (I wanna touch you) 
It's in the morning no interruptions 
It's in the morning, sex in the morning (Sex in the morning) 
It's in the morning I wanna touch (I wanna touch you) 
It's in the morning I wanna love you (I wanna love you) 
It's in the morning no interruptions (Ooo) 
Sex in the morning, sex in the morning (Sex in the morning)
