<song artist="Robin_Thicke" title="Black_Tar_Cloud">
Emergency, emergency
There's a black tar cloud all because of me
Emergency, emergency
There's a black tar cloud all because of me
You're packing up quickly, the baby's at Grandmas
The raging coast is far from clear
You're yelling and screaming and smacking me
How could you do this you spoiled little rich kid
A rock in the TV, you bashing my ride up you smashed my guitar
Chasing me around the house swinging,
Trying to hit me with my favorite golf club
You reved up the car, you smashed through the gate,
I ran up the street
I waited an hour to cool off when I came back,
It was too late
You were lying in bed, said you took 20 pills
Now I'm calling the ambulance, police,
I'm freaking out 'til you said chill
Baby I didn't really take them pills
I'm just desperately crying for help
Emergency
There's a black tar cloud all because of me
Aw emergency, yeah emergency
There's a black tar cloud all because of me
I was licking your wounds I thought we were straight
I thought everyone was gonna eat the chips
Turns out I'm the only one who double dipped
Face down in a puddle of shame,
Drowning in suffering, self-sabotaging
The one thing that made like seem okay
I was jealous of your light,
Jealous of your soul
Good morning, manipulation and control
Emergency
There's a black tar cloud all because of me
Emergency, yeah emergency
There's a black tar cloud all because of me
One heart was more than enough
One body wanted too much
One kiss it wanted to stay
One hand always misbehaved
One eye looked around the room,
One eye looked inside itself and finally
Finally saw the truth yeah, finally saw the truth
Now the sun's going down
Yeah the sun's going down
And all we got left baby is this black tar, black tar, black tar cloud
Emergency, emergency 911, emergency 911,
Emergency 911, emergency 911, emergency 911,
There's a black tar cloud all because of me
There's a black tar cloud, can't see through the clear,
There's a black tar cloud, in both hemispheres
There's a black tar cloud and I brought it here,
There's a black tar cloud, emergency
