<song artist="Robin_Thicke" title="Something_Bad">
There's something bad in me,
Ah there's something bad in me
Yeah there's something bad, something bad,
Something real real bad,
There's something bad in me
Oh yeah, I've been so bad
Oh, I've been so bad baby, bad baby
I've been so bad
In my blood, in my veins, something's got me by the reigns
Try to run but I've been staring down the barrel of a gun
A liar under pressure, feeling mighty dressed up
Look at me, I'm showing off again 'cause vanity's my only friend
I'm in pieces of a puzzle,
If you ever finish baby,
It won't be worth the muscle
But take a leap of faith and baby land in my bed,
But don't you be surprised if I end up messing up your head
There's something bad in me,
Ah there's something bad in me
Yeah there's something bad, something bad,
Something real real bad,
There's something bad in me
Oh yeah, I've been so bad
Oh, I've been such a bad baby, bad baby
I've been so bad
She's a princess but not from kings and queens
Pink Lips on my fingers, ears and ankles, I'm a fiend
Beautiful secrets that nobody's supposed to keep
A bird flew in the window, took a pictures and left with a naughty tweet
I try to be deep before I do bad things
But it feel so good right now, how wrong could this be
I know you wanna fly so baby open up your wings
Then I'll walk out with your legs shaking while you're screaming Robin please
There's something bad in me,
Ah there's something bad in me
Yeah there's something bad, something bad,
Something real real bad,
There's something bad in me
Oh yeah, I've been so bad
Oh, I've been so bad baby, bad baby
I've been so bad
I'm in pieces of a puzzle,
If you ever put together,
Won't be worth the years of trouble
With me you'll wanna do things for the very first time,
Tonight I'm all yours but in the morning, I'm all mine
There's something bad in me,
Ah there's something bad in me
Yeah there's something bad, something bad,
Something real real bad,
There's something bad in me
Oh yeah, I've been so bad
Oh, I've been so bad baby, bad baby
Oh, am such a bad baby, bad baby
I've been so bad baby
Forgive me baby, forgive me baby
I've been such a bad baby
Forgive me baby, don't say its too late
Forgive me baby
