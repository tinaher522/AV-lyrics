<song artist="Robin_Thicke" title="Love_Can_Grow_Back">
Oh you're way too young to dance like that
In front of a man like me baby
Oh yes you are
You know cigarettes are bad for you baby
So am I
Alright
So go our and get them done
When you come back we'll have so much fun
With your new nails on my back
You'll be scratching, and scratching my itch
With your new nails on my back
Something's broken you can only fix
With your new nails
Oh sweet cherry pie apple black
Show your magical touch
And heavenly light on my body baby
Show me our love can grow back
Show me show me show me baby
With your new nails on my back
Oh I like the way you light all the candles
And dance in front of the TV, extra some
Giving me those eyes over your shoulder baby
Like the sun in the rain
You make everything around grow, oh right now
So go our and get them done
When you come back we'll have so much fun
With your new nails on my back
You'll be scratching, and scratching my itch
With your new nails on my back
Something's broken you can only fix
With your new nails
Oh passion for three inches stack
Show your rainbow of hope
And hot pot of gold on my body baby
Show me our love can grow back
Oh the world can be a lonely place
Sometimes you need a new drug
Sweet love can leave such a bitter taste
Sometimes you just be wrong
Every time I see your gorgeous face
Keep me on the right track
Oh baby Keep me on the right track
Show me our love can grow back
