<song artist="Robin_Thicke" title="Against_The_World">
These days it'sÂ hard to find
someone to love
once you find them
you don't want to give up
And now I know that we're
both alone in this
it's just me and you
against the world
And there's me
and there's you
It's just me and youÂ 
against the world
(Oh girl)
And, what am I supposed to do
the alarms are going off in my head
and It's dangerous
yes It's complicated
We're the only ones who get it
the only ones that want this
the only ones who believe
in love
It's just the two of us 
getting into love
It take two of us 
to change the world
I've got you
you've got me
It's just me and you
against the world
Girl, you got me so crazy in longing
and I know it's wrong but so right
and i'm holdingÂ you
I have been dreaming
and I can't let you go
now, you're mine
Girl, what am I supposed to do
the alarms are going off in my head
It's just the two of usÂ 
getting into love
It takes two of usÂ 
to change the world
I got you
you got me
It's just me and you
against the world
It's just the two of us
getting into love
It takes two of us
to change the world
