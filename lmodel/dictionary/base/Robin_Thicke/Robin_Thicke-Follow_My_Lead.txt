<song artist="Robin_Thicke" title="Follow_My_Lead">
Yeah, ladies and gentlemen
I'll like to thank you all for coming out tonight
It's my third album, third tour, third time's a charm
Girl when I go, I really like it
When you roll with me, I got doe,
The-kinda-paper-you can-blow with me,
And babe I know, that money ain't everything,
But its for sure, you pay for nothing
When you fuck with me, when I go
[Chorus]
Follow my lead, baby I could be all you need, if you follow my lead
Follow my lead, I'll hold you down put your trust in me, baby follow my lead
Follow my lead, I think god made you for me, follow my lead
Follow my lead, I'm the one girl in time you'll see
If you follow my lead
Don't listen to the rumors they say 50 fuckin' crazy
50 don't know how to treat a lady
They wrong, I like you a lot I don't wanna hurt you
But I call a square a square and a circle a circle
So if you act like a bitch, I call you a bitch then hang up
Probably call you right back and shit
And I have to say baby I apologize, cross my fingers god forgive me for
Tellin' lies
Like Janet Jackson say "I miss you much, I really wanna feel your touch"
And smell your scent, baby I could pass the day, watchin' you model lingerie"
I wanna spend the night tonight shorty if its okay
You can be my beyonce I'll be your jay
Ha ha
I gotta great sense of humor, first I'll make ya smile then I whoo ya!
You know how I do ya, or do ya?
[Chorus]
After seven hours new york, to London,
You wonderin' whats gonna be the next stop
I told you, im'a don you gonna know I'ma don
After you shop 'till your feet hurt in Milan
Now take a picture these are moments you can cherish
They say the scene of me was made for lovers out in Paris
Ask a fan about me they say "50 we love 'em"
Without them, there's no me so I love them
Man their the reason I exist, the reason I insist
I'm never less then the best so perfection I guess
That's why niggas are stress'd, I'll pass the test
Every time I drop, I'm burnin' hot
So I don't care if she loves me or loves me not
As long as I enjoy the time that we spend
I ain't lookin' for commitment, we could fuck and be friends
Matter fact we can do it right in the back of my Benz
I get it done with speed
[Chorus]
