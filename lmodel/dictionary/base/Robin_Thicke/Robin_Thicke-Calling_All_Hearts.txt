<song artist="Robin_Thicke" title="Calling_All_Hearts">
To the dance floor, tonight
Let love start (let love start)
Calling all party people in the place to be
We gonna celebrate tonight
And rock out with the family
Here we go
Calling all hearts (to the dance floor)
Tonight, let love start
On the dance floor, tonight
Let's go!
I got a feeling everybody need a reason to shout
Leave all your problems and your drama at the door and get down, oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh
This is where we all unite
If we get it right, we gonna light up the sky
At this place, in this time
We gotta let go, 'cause it's great
Calling all hearts (to the dance floor), to the dance floor
Tonight, let love start
On the dance floor, tonight
Tonight, go a little harder with your partner
Heat it up in this place
It's okay to make up
If you take up, put a smile on your face (oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh)
This is very all you and I
We gonna groove
We gonna move into the night
Oh have this amazing time, yeah
You gotta let go 'cause it's alright (it's alright)
Calling all hearts (to the dance floor)
Tonight (Tonight) let love start (Let love start, let love start)
On the dance floor, tonight
If they're beating tonight
Then I'm calling all hearts, you can call in all hearts, yeah
Yeah, a celebration of love
Then I'm calling all hearts, you can call in all hearts, yeah
One, two, three, go
Shake it, shake it down tonight
That's right
Shake it down, shake it down, that's right
Shake it, shake it down tonight
That's right
Shake it down, shake it down, that's right
Oh, yeay dance a little bit more (just dance a little bit more)
Come all night (come together, hey)
Move a little bit more
Come all night, oh yeah
Calling all hearts
To the dance floor, tonight
You gotta let it stop
(You gotta let it stop, you gotta let it stop!)
Back to the dance floor tonight
I'm calling all hearts
I'm calling everybody, I'm calling everyone
I'm calling everybody, get you up on the floor
Tonight is the night, tonight is the night, tonight is the night
I'm calling all hearts, I'm calling all hearts
I'm calling all hearts, I'm calling all hearts
I'm calling all hearts, calling everybody (On the dance floor, on the dance floor tonight)
We're gonna rock tonight
Calling all hearts
Yeah calling all hearts, calling all hearts
Yeah, calling all hearts
