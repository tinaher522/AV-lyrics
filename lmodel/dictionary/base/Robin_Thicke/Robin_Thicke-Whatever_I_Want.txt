<song artist="Robin_Thicke" title="Whatever_I_Want">
I can do whatever I want, ooh baby
I can do whatever I want, finally
I can do whatever I want, freedom
I can do whatever I want, freedom
Kiss me, kiss me, kiss me, kiss me, all over
Kiss me, kiss me, kiss me, kiss me, all over
Kiss me, kiss me, kiss me, kiss me, all over
Kiss me, kiss me, kiss me, kiss me, yeah baby
Now that the monkey on your back is gone
Now that the pain and regret have moved along
Now that you finally have some piece of your mind
Who knows what buried treasure you might find, oh lord come on now
I can do whatever I want, oh yes you can
I can do whatever I want, I'm talking, talking 'bout freedom
I can do whatever I want, freedom
I can do whatever I want, freedom
Kiss me, kiss me, kiss me, kiss me, all over
Kiss me, kiss me, kiss me, kiss me, all over
Kiss me, kiss me, kiss me, kiss me, all over
Kiss me, kiss me, kiss me, kiss me, all over
Kiss me, kiss me, kiss me, kiss me
So deeply intrigued by what you've never had
Emotion explosions none of which are mad
Now every dream you feel is coming true
'Cause there ain't nobody,
Ain't nobody to tell you what to do
I can do whatever I want, yes you can baby
I can do whatever I want,
I'm talking, talking 'bout freedom
I can do whatever I want, freedom
I can do whatever I want, freedom
Kiss me, kiss me, kiss me, kiss me, all over
Kiss me, kiss me, kiss me, kiss me, all over
Kiss me, kiss me, kiss me, kiss me, all over my body
Kiss me, kiss me, kiss me, kiss me, say all right now dance
Dance with me dance with me, hey baby come on!
Dance with me dance with me, i wanna just dance with you
Dance with me dance with me, i got
Dance with me dance with me,
I can do whatever I want, ooh baby
I can do whatever I want, she got that freedom
I can do whatever I want, freedom
I can do whatever I want, she can do what ever she want
She got that freedom, freedom
She got that freedom
Kiss me, kiss me, kiss me, kiss me, all over you body
Kiss me, kiss me, kiss me, kiss me, I wanna kiss you all over
Kiss me, kiss me, kiss me, kiss me,
Kiss me, kiss me, kiss me, kiss me,
I can do whatever I want, oh yes you can
I can do whatever I want, she can do whatever she wants
I can do whatever I want, she can do whatever she wants
I can do whatever I want, freedom
