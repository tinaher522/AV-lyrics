<song artist="Robin_Thicke" title="Flowers_In_Bloom">
All of the flowers in bloom
She took away her sweet love when she died
and all of the flowers have been  put into the garage
so why do I  dance with these fools?
All of my life I'm fallen to her heart
Over and over and over again
Though I made her seem lucky in my arms
made her a promise more than once
Chorus:
I promised her love
She keeps on knocking but she cant get in
and though I promised her love
She keeps on knocking but she cant get in
and though I promised her love
over and over and over again
Over and over
So what do I do with these tears?
She wonders why I get all against her heart
and how can I tell her I love her the way I treat her
Though I made it seem honest more than once
Chorus x 2
All the flowers in bloom
I've never seen such beauty in my life
In all of the daydreams
all of the kids get to play
lalalalalalala....
