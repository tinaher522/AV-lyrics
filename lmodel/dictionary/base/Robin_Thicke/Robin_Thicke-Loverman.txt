<song artist="Robin_Thicke" title="Loverman">
I want to use my hands on your body, 
I want to explore your rivers and your valleys. 
From the top of your mind to the depths of your sea, 
I want to fuel the fire inside of me. 
chorus 
I'm your loverman, digging as deep as I can 
I'm your loverman and I try for. I try for 
I'm your loverman, going ask for best I can 
I'm your loverman and I try for. I try for 

I want to look in your eyes, pass the mask you hide behind 
I want to know all of you, what makes you smile what makes you blue. 
You know I want to please you, take you so high. Forget that you can't fly were just spaceships in the night. 
Your ripping your clothes off of the past 
making a new path and a brand new day 
baby come with me I'll take you away 
I'm your loverman, digging as deep as I can 
I'm your loverman and I try for. I try for 
I'm your loverman, going ask for best I can 
I'm your loverman and I drive for. I drive for 
shay town mi amor, je t'aime mi amor
shay town mi amor, je t'aime mi amor 
From the garden in the versailles, to the desert in dubuai 
From the top of the braymore we can touch the sky. 
chorus 3X 
I'm your loverman, digging as deep as I can 
I'm your loverman and I try for. I try for 
I'm your loverman, going ask for best I can 
I'm your loverman and I try for. I try for
