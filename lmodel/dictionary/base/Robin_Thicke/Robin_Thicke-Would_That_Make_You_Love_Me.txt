<song artist="Robin_Thicke" title="Would_That_Make_You_Love_Me">
If I wasn't who I was
If I wasn't me
Would you stand next to me in the street
If I changed my hair
Would you then be proud
If I ran round town with a different crowd
Would you be my baby 
If I had more money
Would that make you love me more
Would that make you love me more
Would that make you love me more
Would that make you love me more
If I practiced a different religion
If I spoke my words differently
If I changed my tune to your favorite song
Would you wrap your arms around me
If I dug down deep to the bottom
Would you love me unconditionally
If I sound like you and we laugh the same
Would you mind if I hang around
Would that make you love me more
Would that make you love me more
Would that make you love me more
Would that make you love me more
If I came to you from a different place
Would my message finally be heard
If it's just me and you and there's no one else
Would you see how much we're the same
Would you be my lover
If I'm a different color
Would you be my brother
Would that make you love me more (repeat until the end)
