<song artist="Robin_Thicke" title="Vengas_Con_Migo">
Got a call from my boss Mr. Andre Harrell
Don't need me for the weekend
to do what the hell
I packed up the ride and jumped on the cell
I'm callin up my friends
'65 Rivi with the dice in the mirror
Rollin down the coast, the cops on the rear
Goin where the ladies want Tequila &amp; Beer
I'm lookin at the Mami
And where she goes I'm following
Chorus: Bailes y singe conmigo
Quiero que te vengas conmigo amor
Quiero que tu bailes y SIGUE conmigo
Quiero que te vengas conmigo amor
Anywhere we go
We talk and we touch, ooh
I like her so much
A walk on the beach and all the way home
She shows me to her room
Time is flyin till her brother arrives
He's throwin sneakers at my head
And the CDs are flyin
I jumped out the window, left my clothing behind
She never said her name
But where she goes I'm wondering
