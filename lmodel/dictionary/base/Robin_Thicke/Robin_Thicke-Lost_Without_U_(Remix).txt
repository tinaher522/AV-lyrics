(feat. Vanessa Marquez)
Perdida sin ti 
No me puedo ayudar 
Como se siente 
Sabiendo que te amo amor 
Perdida sin ti 
No me puedo ayudar 
Como se siente 
Sabiendo que te amo amor 
You make my waking up everyday that much brighter 
Knowing that im next to you 
I'm so drawn to you 
It's in your eyes 
It's in your sweet face 
Just being in the same space 
I couldn't ask for more 
Tu eres el amor 
That may be the only one to make my life complete 
Perdida sin ti 
No me puedo ayudar 
Como se siente 
Sabiendo que te amo amor 
Perdida sin ti 
No me puedo ayudar 
Como se siente 
Sabiendo que te amo amor 
Baby your the perfect shape 
Baby your the perfect weight 
Treat me like my birthday 
I want it this way 
I want it that way 
I want it 
Tell me you don't want to stop 
Tell me it would break your heart 
But you love me and all my dirty 
You wanna roll with me 
You wanna to hold with me 
You want to make fries and get norwegian world with me 
I just love to hear you say it 
It make a man feel good baby 
I'm lost without you 
Can't help myself 
How does it feel? 
To know that I love ya baby 
I'm lost without you 
Can't help myself 
How does it feel? 
To know that I love ya baby 
Cause you will tell me every morning 
Oooh alright baby ahhh yea 
Aww baby aww darling alright ma 
I'm lost without you 
Can't help myself 
How does it feel? 
To know that I love ya baby 
I'm lost without you 
Can't help myself 
How does it feel? 
To know that I love ya baby
