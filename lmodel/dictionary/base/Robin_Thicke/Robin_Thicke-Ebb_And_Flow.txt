<song artist="Robin_Thicke" title="Ebb_And_Flow">
The clouds part
And the sun shines down on your heart
And the seas part, yeah
Calm the rivers flow, whoo
Oh I just want to float on my back
Feel some of those arms wrapping around me, yeah
Trying to do
What's expected of you
I keep striving
But it hurts to
God
Stress, make it go
Stress, puts up the walls in my soul
And then I
I take it out
On the one
I can't live without, oh
I just gotta let it go, whoo
Sometimes you gotta ebb and flow, hey
Sometimes you love
Sometimes you don't
I just gotta ebb and flow
I'm gonna take what's in front of me tonight
Sometimes you just gotta float
Sometimes the waves are gonna crash you to the shore, whoo
Sometimes the peace comes
And settles your soul
Sometimes the angers so strong
You just wanna lose control
Then I
I take it out
On the one
I can't live without
Alright
I just gotta let it go, Lord
Sometimes you gotta ebb and flow, hey
Sometimes you love
Sometimes you don't
Alright
I just gotta ebb and flow
You know when the good times come
You know the bad gonna come too yeah
I don't know what to call it
But I'll just guess I'll call it
Alright
L-I-F-E
L-I-F-E
Ain't nothing but life man
Life is gonna put you through it, oh
Come on, whooo
