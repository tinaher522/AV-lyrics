Hey mama
Kick him out da bed I'm coming over
Got something to show ya behold ya eyes
I jus' wanna hold you, just hold you tight
Like a four leaf clover I be goin' through
Your flowers baby, your gardens open
A sight for sore eyes
Good lord I'm focused
I can hardly notice anything other then a woman with a face of my future baby mother
(Robin Thicke)
I'm a big man she's a big girl
Put on them heels and put on that skirt
She wants to get naughty we can get bad
She's a good girl with the good girl dance
I'm ice cream shes a hot swirl
We can get married and live in our world
Lets play rough, we can get wild
I could go home but I'll stay
Cheat but I won't
(Lil' Wayne)
So I go by Weezy, love me or leave me
I hate to leave her
I think I need her
She's such a teaser
Such a diva
I could park it right here baby the f**k ya need a?
Do it to me baby I could be your reciever
Call me in the last minute I could be your believer
Call me at the last minute I be that even
Late night, early morning, or maybe this evening
(Robin Thicke)
She ain't no stunt she ain't no Philly
I wanna get mad but then not really
'Cause shes so fly I could get mine
But I do it much better with her by my side
Loves alright
We gone get blitzed tonight
All my girls wanna make that money
All my thugs wanna take that money
All night long Im a milk that honey so
All night long I wait for your lovin' babe
All night long I wait to tear you to pieces
All night long I wait for your lovin babe
All night long I wait all night long
All night long I wait
To see you naked
And watch the sunrise in your face
All night long I wait for you to play
And let my open arms take you away
(Lil' Wanye)
Ye, ya, ya, she said she want to, be the one I get next to
Yes boo, lets do that, who that?, you that
When I want to be the one I get next to
Lets move, get you to the crib
Now I see you was the
One I want to give sex to
Sex you
Sexy you
You sexy devil you,
Angel
Lookin' like you're single
Thank you
Have yourself a drink, I
Drink too saw you when I came through
Now I can't do nothing if it ain't you
It's Wayne, boo, I don't do what them lames do
I come at you from a whole 'nother angle
Now one time for the ladies in the high skirt
Two times for the ladies in the tight jeans
Three times for the ladies who ain't got no panties on
Lets go home
(Robin Thicke)
All night long I wait for your lovin' babe
All night long I wait to tear you to pieces
All night long I wait for your lovin' babe
All night long I wait all night long
All night long I wait
To see you naked
And watch the sunrise in your face
All night long I wait for you to play
And let my open arms take you away
