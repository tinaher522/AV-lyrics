<song artist="Robin_Thicke" title="Never_Give_Up">
Lost your job,
lost your mind
living on the street
for the second time
all you do is dream
another new tonight
I see blue skies in front of me
baby, never give up
don't stop now,
it's never too much
never give up
never give up
hold on babe
never give up
oh, oh, oh, oh, 
I, I, I, I, I, I, I…. never
I, I, I, I, I,
never give up
no, no, no, never give up
never give up, baby yeah
lost your heart
lost your will
on your hands and knees
just for a dollar bill
lost your faith
and your confidence
it never seems fair
nothing make sense
baby, it ain't over
it's not over
it's never over
i said never give up
i said never give up
hold on baby
it's never too much
oh, oh, oh, oh, 
I, I, I, I, I, I, I…. never
I, I, I, I, I,
never give up
never give up
never give up
never give up
never give up
uh.. aha
feel like a joke
I feel like a fool
I should have smarten up
I should have stayed in school
what I'm gonna do?
how am I gonna get by?
I ain't got no whistle 
but I can't stop trying
I said baby,
it ain't over
it's not over
it's never over
never give up
never give up
never give up
never give up
oh, oh, oh, oh, 
I, I, I, I, I, I, I…. never
I, I, I, I, I,
never give up
