<song artist="Robin_Thicke" title="Tie_My_Hands">
(Robin Thicke) 
We are at war 
With the universe 
The sky is falling 
and the only thing that can save us now 
is sensitivity and compassion 
But I know one thing's for sure 
I'm gonna get my kicks before it all burns down 
(Lil Wayne) 
yeah, Some say tragedy is hard to get over 
But some time that tragedy means its over, soulja 
from the academy, league of rollers 
I deny being down though they seem to hold us 
my shoulders are strong, i prove them wrong 
I ain't doing nothin but movin on, let the truth be known 
But they talk that freedom matters, and didn't even leave a ladder, damn 
(Robin Thicke) 
I work at the corner store 
We all got problems problems 
Who was gon fight alone 
No one's gon save us now 
How you feel, you're not alone 
We're all just jealous jealous 
We don't reach the sky no more 
We just can't overcome no 
Chorus (Robin Thicke) 
You tie my hands 
What am I gonna be 
What have I done so bad 
What is my destiny 
You tie my hands 
What am I supposed to see 
What have I done so bad 
What am I gonna be 
(Lil Wayne) 
I, knock on the door, hope isn't home, 
fates not around, the lucks all gone 
don't ask me whats wrong, ask me whats right 
and ima tell you whats life 
and did you know? 
I lost everything, but I ain't the only one 
first came the hurricane, then the morning sun 
Excuse me if I'm on one, and don't trip if i light one, i walk a tight one 
They try to tell me keep my eyes open 
my whole city under water, some people still floatin 
and they wonder why black people still voting, cause your presidents still chokin 
Take away the football team, the basketball team 
now all we got is me to represent New Orleans, shit 
no governor, no help from the mayor 
just a steady beatin heart, and a wish and a prayer 
lets pray 
(Robin Thicke) 
These friends they come and go 
but I got family family 
These kids so fast they grow 
They learn so quickly now 
But there's no where to go, 
but there's future future 
Don't make this seem so low 
And we can't overcome 
Chorus 
(Lil Wayne) 
and if you come from under that water then theres fresh air 
just breathe baby, gods got a blessing to spare 
yes, i know the process has so much stress 
but its the progress that feels the best 
cause i came from the projects straight to success 
and your next, so try they cant steal your pride its inside 
then find it and keep on grinding 
cause in every dark cloud theres a silver lining 
I know... 
yeah, yeah... yeah 
see... Right now we just riding on love 
And shine in the dark, we aint tryna do nothing be at the heart 
We need love, that's all now 
Chorus: 
You tie my hands, what am i gonna be 
What have i done so bad, what is my destiny 
You tie my hands, what am I going to see 
What have I done so bad, what am I gonna be 
Born right here in the USA 
But due to tragedy, looked on by the whole world as a refugee 
So, accept my emotion, do not take it as an offensive gesture 
It's just the epitome of my soul 
And I must be me 
We got spirit y'all 
We go spirit 
We got soul y'all 
We got soul 
They don't want us to see, But we already know 

Jvmx
