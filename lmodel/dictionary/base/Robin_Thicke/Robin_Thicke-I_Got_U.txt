[Girl:]
Doctor, I have a pain
All over my body
And oh doctor, I heard you were the best
Can you help me? Oh doctor, can you heal me?
Do you think I can be cured?
Doctor can you heal me? I hear you're the best
[Robin Thicke:]
Oh, hello...
I'm glad you can make it
Can I offer you a, cocktail? Some roses or champagne perhaps?
We have some chocolate covered strawberries, if you like
Whatever you want, whatever you need
I got you, I got you, I got you... I got you baby
I got you, and you got... me too
Well I will play, we'll always text each other
XXX, we'll always be together
Come with me, fuck with me... please?
And when I tell you, I got you
You know that I'm in it babe (I got you babe)
So just put on your dress, put on your heels
Let's get away (let's get away, get away, get away)
[Robin Thicke:]
Okay, why don't you tell me what's troubling you?
[Girl:]
My man don't take me nowhere
[Robin Thicke:]
Oh, I have just the thing for that
[Girl:]
Please hold for the doctor...
My doctor will be right with you...
(Ooohh) the doctor will see you now...
I got you, I got you, I got you... I got you baby
I got you, and you got... me too
The diamonds, the parties, the trips around the world
Your XXX, you'll always be my girl
Just come with me, fuck with me... please?
And when I tell you, I got you
You know that I'm in it babe (oh, I got you)
So just put on your dress, put on your heels
Let's get away
Baby I got you
And when I tell you, I got you
You know that I'm in it babe (I got you)
So just put on your dress, put on your heels
Let's get away (let's get away, get away, get away)
[Robin Thicke:]
Isn't this nice?
Perfect...
