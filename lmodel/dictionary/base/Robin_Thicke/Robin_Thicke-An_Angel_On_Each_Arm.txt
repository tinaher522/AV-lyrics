Yes, you should be afraid
Yes, you should be afraid, baby
They in the bushes, look in the trees
They got they red laser sniper rifles stuck on me
Creeping up slow, ducking down real close
They go to huffing, puffing, knock down the door
Come on now
Well, let's get it started
Load your gun, light the fuse
I'm coming for you, baby
I got to stand and fight
I'm locked and loaded now
I'm heavily armed
I got an angel on each arm
I got that, an angel on each arm, baby
Alright now
You know I got that one on my left, come on
One on my right, alright
They protect me every day and every night, I got that
I saw it so clear, two hearts flying in my mirror
Then I knew good things were gonna come, now, now, now
A fortune teller, she read my palm
She said hard times will soon be over, good times will come
Well, let's get it started
Load your gun, light the fuse
I'm coming for you, baby
I got to stand and fight
I'm locked and loaded now
Heavily armed
I got an angel on each arm, now, now, now
An angel on each arm, baby, yeah
Come on, I got that
One on my left
I got one on my right, alright
They protect me every day and every night, so come on
Yes, you should be afraid
I said, yes, you should be afraid
'Cause I come for everyone
No lies, no regrets, no denial, no empty bets
Just as truth as I am
Alright now
Well, let's get it started
Load your gun, light the fuse
I'm coming for you, baby
I got to stand and fight
I'm locked and loaded now
Heavily armed
I got an angel on each arm, now, now, now
An angel on each arm, baby, come on, huh
You know I got that one on my left
I got one on my right, alright
They protect me every day and every night, so come on
Ooh, come on, I said come on, come on baby
I got the, a bullet with your name on it, best be afraid of it
'Cause I'm coming for you baby
Don't try to stop me, I'm coming to get you, get you, get you, get you
I got an angel on each arm, yeah, alright, yeah
An angel on each arm, baby, alright now
You know I got that one on my left, come on
One on my right, alright
They protect me every day and every night, bring it on baby
