<song artist="Robin_Thicke" title="Rollacoasta">
It's fashion (x3)
It's strobelight, it's fashion, it's strobelight
It's rollacoasta!
Slap me in my face, punch me in the eye.
Do me how you want  baby  but just don't say goodbye
Tell me i'm no good, tell me i'm not right
Just let me lay beside you when you fall asleep tonight
Rollacoasta
Trow your hands up
Take me to the top
Rollacoasta
Up side down i never wanna stop
Rollacoasta
Take me to the limit till i drop
Rollacoasta make you  scream (make you scream alright)
Make you scream, make you scream
Take me back, take me back
One more time around the track 
One more time just on the top let me ride with you tonight
Here we go round and round twist and turn i'm heavenbound
One more time around the track 
Tell me that you knowaaaaaaa (x2)
It's fashion it's strobelights
It's rollacoasta
Hate me in the morning
Sex me up at noon
Girl have me for dinner, baby tease me with your food
Get mad at me for drinkin' shout at me to stop 
But you know i'm the only one that ever hits your spot
Rollacoasta
Trow your hands up
Take me to the top
Rollacoasta
Up side down i never wanna stop
Rollacoasta
Take me to the limit till i drop
Rollacoasta make you  scream (make you scream alright)
Make you scream, make you scream
Take me back, take me back
One more time around the track 
One more time just on the top let me ride with you tonight
Here we go round and round twist and turn i'm heavenbound
One more time around the track 
Tell me that you knowaaaaaaa (x2)
It's fashion it's strobelights
It's rollacoasta
One more time (x2)
It's fashion
Take me to the edges one more time
I'll come right down again
Take me on a ride boy if you dare
You know i'm going in
Rollacoasta make you scream, make you scream
Rollacoasta
Trow your hands up
Take me to the top
Rollacoasta
Up side down i never wanna stop
Rollacoasta
Take me to the limit till i drop
Rollacoasta make you  scream (make you scream alright)
Make you scream, make you scream
Take me back, take me back
One more time around the track 
One more time just on the top let me ride with you tonight
Here we go round and round twist and turn i'm heavenbound
One more time around the track 
Tell me that you knowaaaaaaa (x2)
It's fashion it's strobelights it's rollacoasta (X2)
It's fashion, it's strobelights, it's...
Rollacaosta make you scream, make you scream (x3)
