<song artist="Robin_Thicke" title="Jus_Right">
It's jus right, it's jus right
A million words will never say
The way I truly feel about
The one I just can't live without 
Coz it's like that, it's like that
The way you move, the way you dance
The way I know the moment when
You need my love, you need my hand
And all I wanna do is see you
All I wanna do is please you
I'm hypnotized by everything you do
I hope I'm jus right for you
[Chorus]
And baby I know, you're the only one for me
And it's right there on your lips
And it's right there in your kiss
And baby I know, you're the only air I breathe
And it's right there on your lips
And it's right there in your kiss
Jus right, jus right, jus right (Whoo)
Jus right, jus right, jus right
Jus right, jus right, jus right
Jus right for me
I'll take you here, I'll take you there
I'll take your body anywhere
Baby I'll work so hard for you,
To make your fantasy come true
Coz it's like that, it's like that
I got your front, I got your back
Well take it slow, we'll make it last
Coz it's like that, it's like that
A little bit sweet, a little bit spice
A little bit naughty, a little bit nice
Tell me baby that you need me too
That I'm jus right for you
(Chorus)
It's like that, it's like that
Jus right, jus right
