<song artist="Robin_Thicke" title="Ask_Myself">
I gotta ask myself,
What's it gon' be?
Am I gon' save myself?
What's it gon' be?
I gotta ask myself,
What I'm gon' do?
Am I gon' save myself?
What's it gon' be?
I gotta pop up, pop up
Gotta get up every day
Something for me and my family
I gotta make decisions
And be somebody
I'm growin up as fast as I can
I gotta make some money
Don't wanna live by their rules
In and out the day
In and out the night
Im a find my way
Just to survive
I gotta ask myself,
What's it gon' be?
Am I gon' save myself?
What's it gon' be?
I gotta ask myself,
What I'm gon' do?
Am I gon' save myself?
What's it gon' be?
Something beautiful inside of me
Something wonderful inside of me
Something beautiful inside of me
Something wonderful inside of me
I gotta pop up, pop up
Gotta live up to the words
Everyones talkin', talkin'
I gotta be somebody
And for my baby
I'm growin up as fast as I can
I gotta make life better for everyone
Everyone, everyone, everyone
Just to survive
I gotta ask myself,
What's it gon' be?
Am I gon' save myself?
What's it gon' be?
I gotta ask myself,
What I'm gon' do?
Am I gon' save myself?
What's it gon' be?
