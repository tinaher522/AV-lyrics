<song artist="Robin_Thicke" title="Make_A_Baby">
There's so many places
People to see
Dinners and parties to fill up the week
But I'm scared like a baby
Of being alone
Of turning the lights off with no one to hold oh no
I know I'm sure of what it's gonna be
I wanna go and make a baby with you
I wanna jump into the treehouse
But what we should do
Is we got to get together
Got to get together to right it
Diamonds and peacocks lining the street
I'm talking to strangers ant they're talking to mo
I'm scrising to the crystals out of the sac
Life is a yo-yo and family is a drag, I know
But what I'm sure of is what it's gotta be
I wanna go and make a baby with you
I wanna crash into the open arms
What we do is we got to get together
Got to get together right
Find me, find me.
