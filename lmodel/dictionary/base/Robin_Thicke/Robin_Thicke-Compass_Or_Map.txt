<song artist="Robin_Thicke" title="Compass_Or_Map">
Oh, I got a problem rising deep from my bones
Years of hibernation, I can't wait to be exposed
Leaping from the darkness to feel the new moon and light
It howls like a jet plane and echoes through the night
Oh, now you done it, you woke up some stuff
We gone have to talk about it 'round here, things might get rough
You poked a sleeping giant that ain't ate in months
And when it opens it's eyes, first thing it's gonna wanna do
Welcome to my jungle, welcome to my world
I'm no longer boy and you're much stronger a girl
I'm now barracuda and you're now Thundercat
And we're at war, we're at war with no compass or map
No compass or map
No boundary fences, no ceilings or doors
No blanks or dull knives, just shrieks and unheard roars
Fake, fake friendly faces, time, time safe for basis
No emergency numbers, you went and planted erases
No bell to guide you, just blue, black, and stars
Wrapped us in angry earth, manipulated your heart
Night, night winds whip you back, under high fortress sky
The place brands your back 'til undiscovered you died
Welcome to my oyster, don't you touch my pearl
I used to be your J-bird and you used to be my squirrel
Now I'm barracuda and you're Thundercat
And we're at war, we're at war with no compass or map
(We don't need no)
(We don't need no) compass or map
(We don't need no)
(We don't need no)
I got respect for my enemy, in the shadows they lie
In the shadows we live and in the shadows we cry
And the fashion of virtue is now a hopeless appeal
'Cause love is core side to side that you can't keep what you steal
You can't keep what you steal
You can't keep what you steal
Welcome to my Milky, you can't change my universe
The things that won't last, we always seem to put first
Now I'm Mt. Olympus, you're baby kay yay
We could end this war, we could end this war
We could end this war, we could end this war
We don't need no (we don't need no)
We don't need no (we don't need no)
Compass or map, we don't need no, no, no, no, no, no
We don't need no compass or map
We can make it babe
We don't need nobody
All we need is you and me
We'll work it out, baby
