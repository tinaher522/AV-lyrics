Touch me you're my fantasy
My body is yours
My heart is yours
Touch me you're my fantasy
My body is yours
My love is yours
Touch me you're my fantasy
Oh baby I got a feeling
We ain't never gonna be friends
Oh baby I got a feeling tonight
Oh baby I got a feeling
We were lovers in a previous life
Oh baby I got a feeling
Tonight
Please please please please
Please please please please
Touch me you're my fantasy
My body is yours
My heart is yours
Touch me you're my fantasy
My body is yours
My love is yours
Touch me you're my fantasy
My body is yours
My heart is yours
Touch me you're my fantasy
My body is yours
My love is yours
Touch me you're my fantasy
I don't know how you do it
Working the way you are
Trying to be a mother, earning lady, and a star
I will always day dream
Wishing that you were mine
I understand that now you need some space and time
I can smell your perfume
Your legs on my walls
Your body's on my ceiling
You eagle down the hall
I remember when I was the only one you called
Everything is changed
Everything is changed
Please please please please
Please please please
Touch me you're my fantasy
My body is yours
My heart is yours
Touch me you're my fantasy
My body is yours
My love is yours
Touch me you're my fantasy
My body is yours
My heart is yours
Touch me you're my fantasy
My body is yours
My love is yours
Let it go
Eyes down low
You're my fantasy
Here we go
The angels know
You're my fantasy
Let it go
Eyes down low
You're my fantasy
Here we go
Only you are my fantasy
Touch me you're my fantasy
My body is yours
My heart is yours
Touch me you're my fantasy
My body is yours
My love is yours
Touch me you're my fantasy
My body is yours
My heart is yours
Touch me you're my fantasy
My body is yours
My love is yours
Can't get too much of you baby
I'll never make it without your love
Can't enough of you baby
I'll never make it without your love
Can't get too much of you baby
I'll never make it without your love
Can't enough of you baby
I'll never make it without your love
Please please please please
Please please please please
