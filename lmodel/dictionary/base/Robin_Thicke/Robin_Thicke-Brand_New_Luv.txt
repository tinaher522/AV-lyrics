<song artist="Robin_Thicke" title="Brand_New_Luv">
It's a new love it's a new day it's a new world it's a brand new love
You and me babe one on one
I never thought I'd be so happy with my new love
Like the first fall of snow
Rainy days with you to hold
Bare feet on the beach
Skinny dippin you and me
Don't matter if it's cold
I got you to keep me warm
You make me feel just like a child
I just wanna make you smile
We're just walking in the park
Holdin' hands til it gets dark
It's so simple babe we just wanna be in love
It's a new love it's a new day it's a new world it's a brand new love
You and me babe one on one
I never thought I'd be so happy with my new love
It's a new love it's a new day it's a new world it's a brand new love
You and me babe one on one
I never thought I'd be so happy with my new love
Come and sit on my lap
I can't get enough of that
My finger tips on your back
I just wanna make you smile
You never have to be alone oooh
You got me to keep you warm
I change the way you look at me
I just wanna make you smile
We're just sitting on the dock of the bay
Watching the past go by
With the resilen under your skirt
Give you my jacket and hold you close ooohh
It's a new love it's a new day it's a new world it's a brand new love
You and me babe one on one
I never thought I'd be so happy with my new love
It's a new love it's a new day it's a new world it's a brand new love
You and me babe one on one
I never thought I'd be so happy with my new love
