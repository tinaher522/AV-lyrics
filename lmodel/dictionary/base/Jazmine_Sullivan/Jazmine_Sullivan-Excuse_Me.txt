<song artist="Jazmine_Sullivan" title="Excuse_Me">
Oh, give me just a minute, just a second
I gotta get it off my chest
Ain't no competition, when you're in it
Let you know that you're the best
If I never told you baby
I really do appreciate it
Keep on like you do and I'll always be true
Because no one, no not no one ever made me feel
(No one, no one)
Like I could be dreaming 'cause you can't be real
(And it makes)
Makes me so happy, yes it makes me cry
(Yes it makes)
And I know you're looking at me probably thinking why but
Excuse me if I'm sounding crazy but you've been the
One I've been hoping and waiting for
I have searched all around but there's nobody else in the world
Who love me like you do
I ain't never had another man that give me what you give to me
Got me in the kitchen, fixing dinner
Make me wanna cook and clean
And just to see you smiling at me
Baby you don't even have to ask me
Don't care what the task be if it makes you happy
Because no one, no not no one ever made me feel
(No one, no one)
Like I could be dreaming 'cause you can't be real
(And it makes)
Makes me so happy, yes it makes me cry
(Yes it makes)
And I know you're looking at me probably thinking why but
Excuse me if I'm sounding crazy but you've been the
One I've been hoping and waiting for
I have searched all around but there's nobody else in the world
Who love me like you do
Let me explain why I'm acting this way
You're all that I need so don't ever change
Your love takes me higher, higher, higher
Excuse me if I'm sounding crazy but you've been the
One I've been hoping and waiting for
Searched all around but there's nobody else in the world, world, world
Excuse me if I'm sounding crazy but you've been the
One I've been hoping and waiting for
Oh, I've searched all around but there's nobody, nobody, nobody, baby
You'll have to excuse me if I'm sounding crazy but you've been the
One I've been hoping and waiting for
Oh, I've searched all around but there's nobody else in the world, world
Baby, nobody never loved me like you do
And I'm so mighty, might glad about it, baby
