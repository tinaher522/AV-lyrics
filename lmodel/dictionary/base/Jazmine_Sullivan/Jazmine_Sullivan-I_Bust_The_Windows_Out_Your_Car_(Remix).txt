Intro:
I,I,I
I,I,I
Radio,Radio,Radio
Killah(killah)
Verse1:Jazmine:
I Bust The Windows Out Your Car
And Though It Didn't Mend My Broken Heart
I'll Probably Always Have These Ugly Scars
But Riht Now I Dnt Care About That Part
I Bust The Windows Out Your Car
After I Saw You Laying Nexxt To Her
I Didnt Wanna But I Took My Turn
Im Glad I Did It Cuz You Had To Learn
Chorus:Jazmine:
I Must Admit It Helped A Little Bit
To Think Of How You'd Feel Wen You Saw It
I Didnt Know That I Had That Much Strength
But Im Glad You See Wat Happens Wen
You See You Cant Just Play With Peoples Feelings (I,I,I)
Tell Them You Love Them And Dnt Mean It (I,I,I)
You'll Probably Say That It Was Juvenile (I,I,I) 
But I Think(I,I,I) That I(I,I,I) Deserve To Smile(I,I,I)
Verse2:The-Dream:
Radio (Radio)
Radio Killah
Now Girl You Know You Broke My Heart
Ay
Not Becuz Your Gone
But Wat You Done To My Car
Now Its In The Shop
For The Nexxt 2 Weeks
By then you wnt even remember why you're mad at me
I Didnt Break Your Heart
(Shawty I didnt Break Your Heart)
This Time Babi You Went Too Far (U Went Too Far)
If You Were To Pull Bak The Sheets (Sheets)
You Would'Ve Noticed That It Wasnt Me (AY!)
Go Ahead Apologize (Go Ahead Apologize)
I Told You 5 Times That I Wasnt There
But You Rather Believe
Keisha That Told Tameka
And Camp and dem
And They Just Mad Cuz I Aint Sleeping With Them
So Shawty Get Up In Dis Biz (Biz)
Hey
R U Crying or Are Those Tears Frum Tha Wind
Cuz U Was Actin FooLish
Did You Lose Your Mind
Sure You Bust The Windows out
But You Know Cuz You Bust The One Out On Yo Side
(Yo Side, Yo Side)
Now You Looking Silly In The Car(Ca,Ca,Car)
You Dnt Trust me
(You Looking Silly In The Car Ca Ca Car)
And You Didnt Love Me
Like I Loved You
Woooh ooo woh oh oh
But Its All Right
And Its Ok
Cuz I was Leaving Any Ways
Ending:repeat:The-Dream:
