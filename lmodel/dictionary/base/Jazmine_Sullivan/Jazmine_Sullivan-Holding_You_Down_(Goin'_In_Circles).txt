<song artist="Jazmine_Sullivan" title="Holding_You_Down_(Goin'_In_Circles)">
Why cant I find somebody else
When I know
Know that you're doing wrong
Its so hard
Hard to let go
I done went through just about two bags of tissues baby
And you're looking at me like you ain't the issue baby
And though I tried to leave
I cant stop missing you baby
And I keep coming
I keep coming back
I keep going in circles, circles
Round and round
And while you're doing me so wrong
I just keep holding you down
I feel so stupid, foolish
Loving you all this way
But what I can I say
But I wanna go
I wanna go
But I keep coming back
Why I'm so confused for you, 
I have no answer boy
When I feel so used by you just like a toy
Its a shame that you don't care enough 
To even give me half the love I give to you 
I live for you baby
I'm ashamed to say that I'm to blame for how you act
Cuz I keep coming
I keep coming back
I'm going in circles, circles
Round and round
And while you're doing me so wrong
I just keep holding you down
I feel so stupid, foolish
Loving you all this way
But what I can I say
But I wanna go
I wanna go
But I keep coming back
I cant stop... missing you baby
I stay cuz I love you
But I hate that I stay
You know I won't go 
Thats why you treat me this way
I want to be happy
Though it hurts me so bad
Don't know what it is that keeps me coming back
Keep going in circles, circles
Round and round
And while you're doing me so wrong
I just keep holding you down
I feel so stupid, foolish
Loving you all this way
But what I can I say
But I wanna go
I wanna go
But I keep coming back
