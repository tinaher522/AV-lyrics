Hey
I met him at the bookstore
He said he'd like to get to know me just a little more
Asked me to dinner
I said I'd bring my girlfriend
He said that's cool 'cause he was gonna bring his best friend
But something happened that I wasn't expecting
His best friend all night has my attention
Know it was wrong
I couldn't help it
And I don't care
I'm bein' selfish
Know what I want and I want your best friend
Ain't gonna front, uhh-uhh, I want your best friend
Hey boy, I think I like your best friend
Would you mind if I dinned with your best friend
Switch
And you can take me girlfriend
I hardly know you, so there is no attachments
You take my chair, I'll sit right there
Well see how that feels
And don't be mean and make a scene
It ain't a big deal
'Cause somethin' happened that I wasn't expecting
His best friend all night had my attention
Know it was wrong
I couldn't help it
And I don't care
I'm bein' selfish
Know what I want and I want your best friend
Ain't gonna front, uhh-uhh, I want your best friend
Hey boy, I think I like your best friend
Would you mind if I dinned with your best friend
Switch
See baby
It really ain't a big deal (switch)
I mean, you a nice guy and all, but (switch)
If I met him, when I met you (switch)
He probably would've got the phone call
Don't make no sense to leave with the wrong guy
When your best friend could be the love of my life
Know it was wrong
I couldn't help it
And I don't care
I'm bein' selfish
Know what I want and I want your best friend
Ain't gonna front, uhh-uhh, I want your best friend
Hey boy, I think I like your best friend
Would you mind if I dinned with your best friend
Switch
Somethin' happened unexpected
She didn't think that this would happen
She liked this guy, had a connection
It's just with her date's best friend
Ha, ha, ha, ha
Who would've guessed it?
Switch, switch, switch, switch
Hey boy, I think I like your best friend
Would you mind if I dinned with your best friend
