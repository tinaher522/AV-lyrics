(Chorus)
Baby smile for me don't frown,
'cuz after a while everything will be alright. 
Just wipe your tears don't frown,
'cuz after a while everything will work out fine.
(Verse) 
I know sometimes life gets hard 
And you wanna break down and cry, you wanna know why. 
Life seems to bring you pain, 
When there can be sunshine, 
It don't cease to rain. Ooo baby. 
(Chorus)
Baby smile for me don't frown, 
'cuz after a while everything will be alright. 
Just wipe your tears don't frown,
'cuz after a while everything will work out fine.
(Verse) 
Surrounded by complications, 
Only brings aggrivations. 
Put the negative behind you, and end the equation.
So keep your head up to the sky, 
And you find that everything will be alright. 
(Chorus)
Baby smile for me don't frown, 
'cuz after a while everything will be alright. 
Just wipe your tears don't frown, 
'cuz after a while everything will work out fine. 
Baby smile for me don't frown, 
'cuz after a while everything will be alright. 
Just wipe your tears don't frown, 
'cuz after a while everything will work out fine. 
(Bridge) 
Even though skies are gray and nothing seems to go your way. 
Wipe your tears, face your fears, tomorrow is a brighter day! 
Heyyyyy
(Chorus)
Baby smile for me don't frown, 
'cuz after a while everything will be alright. 
Just wipe your tears don't frown, 
'cuz after a while everything will work out fine. (x3)
