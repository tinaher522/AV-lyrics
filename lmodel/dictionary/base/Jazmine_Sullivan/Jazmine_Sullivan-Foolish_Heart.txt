<song artist="Jazmine_Sullivan" title="Foolish_Heart">
My foolish heart, it made me fall in love with him
I know it goes with how it's feeling
My foolish heart was broken when he left us in the cold
Now, I'm left to fix the pieces
I told you once, I told you twice
The next time I won't be so nice
You so quick to give it up
But you don't think about us
You don't think about us
I won't let you keep, keep hurting me
If you gon' keep causing me pain
I won't let you keep, keep hurting me
I'm 'bout to take you out the game
My foolish heart will jump into the deepest of the seas
Even if it cannot swim
My foolish heart will trust just anyone, it's so naive
And I'm left to save it again
I told you once, I told you twice
The next time I won't be so nice
You so quick to give it up
But you don't think about us
You don't think about us
I won't let you keep, keep hurting me
If you gon' keep causing me pain
I won't let you keep, keep hurting me
I'm 'bout to take you out the game
I can't take another broken heart
Maybe we should spend time apart
Driving me crazy, I can't take it no more
Maybe we should spend time apart
I told you once, I told you twice
The next time I won't be so nice
You so quick to give it up
But you don't think about us
You don't think about us
I won't let you keep, keep hurting me
If you gon' keep causing me pain
I won't let you keep, keep hurting me
I'm 'bout to take you out the game
I told you once, I told you twice
The next time I won't be so nice
You so quick to give it up
But you don't think about us
You don't think about us
I won't let you keep, keep hurting me
If you gon' keep causing me pain
I won't let you keep, keep hurting me
I'm 'bout to take you out the game
