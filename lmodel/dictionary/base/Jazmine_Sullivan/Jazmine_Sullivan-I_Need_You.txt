Ay baby weh you ah deal with?
We come tru alot a tings you kno?
So wahamum to you?
Me make one likkle mistake you wan dun us?
If I had you back in my world
I would prove that I could be a better girl
Oh oh oh
If you let me back in
I would sho'nuff never never let you go again(hey baby)
I was so foolish to ever leave your side,
Searching for what was right before my eyes
It was me who didn't realize
'till it was gone but now I know
I need you in my life
Boy I need you bad as my heartbeat,
(Bad like the food I eat)
Bad as the air I breath, (Baby I want you bad)
I need you bad I can't take this pain, (Bad I can't take this pain)
Boy I'm 'bout to go insane (Baby I need you bad)
I need you,
I need you,
What I gotta do (Baby I want you bad)
I need you,
I need you,
Do it all for you
(Baby I need you)
Baby there's nothing I wouldn't do
To get back what we had when love was true.
(Oh oh oh)
No lie I'd give up all I got
Just so I could get back in my spot (Ooooh)
Boy I need you bad as a heartbeat, (Bad like the food I eat)
Bad like the air I breath, (Baby I want you bad)
I need you bad I can't take this pain, (Bad I can't take this pain)
Boy I'm bout to go insane (Baby I need you bad)
Cause I need you,
I need you,
What I gotta do (Baby I want you bad)
I need you,
I need you,
Do it all for you (Baby I need you)
When you want him so bad and you gotta get him back say oh oh oh oh
(Oh oh oh oh)
Cause it won't get no better till you are together say oh oh oh oh
(Oh oh oh oh)
If you believe in love and you can't give him up say oh oh oh oh
(Oh oh oh oh)
If there's nothing you won't do to get back with your boo say, Oooohhh
Boy I need I you bad as a heartbeat, (Bad like the food I eat)
Bad like the air I breath, (Baby I want you bad)
I need you bad I can't take this pain, (Bad I can't take this pain)
Boy I'm bout to go insane (Baby I need you bad)
I need you,
I need you,
What I gotta do (Baby I want you bad)
I need you,

Do it all for you (Baby I need you)
