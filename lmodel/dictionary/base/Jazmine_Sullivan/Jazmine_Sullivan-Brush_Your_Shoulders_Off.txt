Spoken:
I told Melinda
This crazy right here
We gon' do it
Like this for 2004
I'm feelin' this one
You feelin' this one
Right here right
Mmhhmm (3x)
We gon bring it crazy
Got no time
For the fake ones
They smile and smile
In ya face
When they leave
They say some
But you too good
And let
Them play down
Don't just stoop
On they level
No education
Chorus:
Now don't get mad
(Gon' brush yo shouldas)
Go on and brush
Yo shouldas off
(Gon' brush yo shouldas off)
Like Jay-Z said
(Gon brush yo shouldas off)
Go on brush yo shouldas off
(Gon' brush yo shouldas off)
Come on brush yo shouldas off
(Brush yo shouldas off)
Go and brush yo shouldas off
(Brush ya shoudlas off)
Come on brush yo shouldas off
(Gon brush yo shouldas off) (2x)
Misery, needs company
So you be the bigger one
And get up and leave
(Mmhmm)
'Cause ain't no stoppin' us
Keep rockin'
They smile and smile
In ya face
Backstabbers mean nothin'
Oooooh
(Chorus)
Like Jay-Z Said (4x)
