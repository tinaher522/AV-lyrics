<song artist="Jazmine_Sullivan" title="If_This_Is_Love">
Ooh ooh ohh,
I just can't imagine, 
A life without love,
'Coz a life without love,
Is a life without purpose.
Can't stop smiling,
And I feel like crying,
Left the  heartache,
And we all looking for something,
Tears flow with no end,
But then he makes me smile again,
My Joy, 
My Pain, 
But I Wouldn't Trade It For Nothing, 
If this Is Love, 
Never Thought It'd Be This Real, 
But I, 
Never Would Have Give It All, 
If This Is Real, 
It's Funny How It Makes You Feel, 
But I, 
Never Would Have Give It All, 
If this Is Love, 
A life without love 6x's 
I never imagined this is how the story ends, 
Let go expectations, And remember nothings perfect, 
Cherish the good days, 
And learn from more from mistakes, 
Coz, Love is a Journey, But remember that its worth it, 
If this Is Love 
Never Thought It'd Be This Real 
But I 
Never Would Have Give It All 
If This Is Real 
It's Funny How It Makes You Feel 
But I 
Never Would Have Give It All 
If This Is Love 
The hurt and the pain, 
The Sun and the rain, 
It ain't easy, it gets hard but, 
I can't see a life without love, 
A life without love 8x's
