If I had you
Back in my world
I would prove
That I could be
A better girl
Oh, oh, oh
If you let me back in
I would sho'nuff never
Never let you go again
(Hey, baby)
I was so foolish
To ever
Leave your side
Searching
For what was right
Before my eyes
It was me
Who didn't realise
'Till it was gone
But now I know
I need you in my life
Boy
I need you bad
As my heartbeat
(Bad like the food I eat)
Bad as the air I breath
(Baby, I want you bad)
I need you bad
I can't take this pain
(Bad I can't take this pain)
Boy

(Baby, I need you bad)

What I gotta do
(Baby I want you bad)
I need you

Do it all for you
(Baby, I need you)
Baby
There's nothing
I wouldn't do
To get back
What we had
When love was true
(Oh, oh, oh)
No lie
I'd give up
All I got
Just so
I could get back
In my spot
(Ooooh)
Boy I need you bad
As a heartbeat
(Bad like the food I eat)
Bad like the air I breath
(Baby, I want you bad)
I need you bad
I can't take this pain
(Bad I can't take this pain)
Boy

(Baby, I need you bad)
Cause I need you

What I gotta do
(Baby, I want you bad)
I need you

Do it all for you
(Baby, I need you)
Ahh, Let's go
When you want him
So bad
And you gotta
Get him back
Say oh, oh, oh, oh
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Cause if wrong
Ain't no better two
You are together
Say oh, oh, oh, oh
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
If you believe in love
And you
Can't give him up
Say oh, oh, oh, oh
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
If there's nothing
You won't do
To get back
With your boo say
