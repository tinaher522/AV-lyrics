<song artist="Jazmine_Sullivan" title="10_Seconds">
You did me wrong for the last time
And I took so much from you, baby
But you really crossed the line
You know I ain't mad for nothing
I call my momma, she go to my cousins
And they ain't never liked you
From the beginning
So listen I'm giving you only ten seconds to go
One, two, three
(Four)
Five, six, seven
(Oh, oh)
Eight, nine
(Baby, we getting closer)
Just don't let me get to ten
(Oh, boy)
You broke my heart
With all your lies
You really should look for an exit
'Cause you running out of time
You know that I can get crazy
When I go off, ain't nobody to tame me
I'm throwing and breaking shit
Cussing and looking for something to hit you with
You got 10 seconds to go
One, two, three
(Four)
Five, six, seven
(Oh oh)
Eight, nine
(Baby, I'm getting closer)
Just don't let me get to ten
(Don't let me get to, oh, boy)
Oh, oh baby
I'm going, I'm going crazy
Boy, you should move it
'Cause I'm 'bout to lose it
And this ain't a game
And I'm not playing
I honestly think that I'm being generous
Gave you my all and look what you did to us
Look how you finished us
So this is what I'm gonna do
Ten seconds is all that I'm giving you
One, two, three
(Four)
Five, six, seven
(Oh oh)
Eight, nine
(Baby, we getting closer)
Just don't let me get to ten
(Don't let me get to, oh, boy)
One, two, three
(Four)
Five, six, seven
(Oh oh)
Eight, nine
(Baby, we getting closer)
Just don't let me get to ten
(Don't let me get to, oh, boy)
