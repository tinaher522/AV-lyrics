<song artist="Jazmine_Sullivan" title="Silent_Tears">
Don't know
If you feel the same
So I keep
My thoughts hidden
We both agreed
To be friends
But emotions have risen
Wish you
Would give a sign
That you know
How i'm feeling
But until then
I'll cry silent tears
(I'l cry silent tears)
Oh, but until
Then I'll cry silent tears
(I'll cry silent tears)
Oh, oh
But until
Then I'll cry silent tears
(I'll cry silent tears)
Don't wanna be in this world
Living this life with out you
Don't wanna live on this earth
Loving nobody else but you
Don't wanna be in this world
Living this life with out you
Don't wanna live on this earth
Loving nobody else but you
What we shared together
Was beautiful
I never felt
Anything like our essence
But if I cant have you
I'd rather be
In your presence
Crying these silent tears
(I'll cry silent tears)
Oh, oh, oh
Crying theses silent tears
(I'll cry silent tears)
Don't wanna be in this world
Living this life
With out you babe
Don't wanna live on this earth
Loving nobody else but you
Don't wanna be in this world
Living this life
With out you babe
Don't wanna live on this earth
Loving nobody else but you
(Nobody but you)
(Cry, cry silent tears)
Cry
I'll keep crying
(Cry silent tears)
(Cry, cry silent tears)
I'll keep crying
(Cry silent tears)
(Cry, cry silent tears)
Crying silent tears
(Cry, cry silent tears)
Oh I'll keep on
(Cry, cry silent tears)
Until the day
When I get sad
That I love you
(Cry, cry silent tears)
I'll keep on crying
(Cry, cry silent tears)
I'll keep on crying
(Cry, cry silent tears)
Oh im crying inside
Cause I don't know
If you feel
The same way about me
Like I feel about you
(Cry)
Oh, baby
Baby this feeling
Is so strong
(Cry)
Oh
And it's so strong
(Cry)
That I cant let you go
(Cry)
I can't let you go
(Cry)
I can't let you go
(Cry)
I can't let you go
(Cry)
I can't let you go
I cant
Let you go
