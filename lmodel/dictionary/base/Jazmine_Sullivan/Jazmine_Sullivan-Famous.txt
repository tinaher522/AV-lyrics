<song artist="Jazmine_Sullivan" title="Famous">
I used to dream about cars and things
'Bout being a star and things
I thought that I would outgrow this feeling
It seems my dream won't go away
So it's more like a nightmare, keepin' me up all night
Like a nightmare, it's taking over my mind
My desire burns inside like a flame
And it can't and it won't be contained
'Cause I gotta be famous
I need to be somebody
No one wants to be invisible
Everyone just wants to be seen
I know one thing is so irresistible
'Cause we all need a reason to be
So I wanna matter to the world
To a girl watching me on TV
Watching me and I want her
To wanna be me, to be me
And I wanna be her dream, be hear dream
So I gotta be famous
I gotta be somebody
So I gotta be famous
I gotta be somebody
And I'll do anything to get where you are
I'll do anything to reach the stars
You don't want what you have but I want it so bad
You say it ain't fair but what ain't fair
Is no one cares if you ain't famous, you ain't famous
So I gotta be famous
I gotta be somebody
'Cause I gotta be famous
I need to be somebody
