We on a world tour
Wale your man hustlin' in each and every ghetto with the mic in my hand
New York, VA, DC, get paid
We on a world tour Wale your man
Hustlin' in each and every gutta with the mic in my hand
London, Tokyo, we goin' take you all around the globe.
(Lets go, lets go)
(Lets go, lets go)
(oh)
Momma ain't raise no fool, true
But me and my brother never made it out school
She prayed only passing out bar
It's way different ma you see em' passing out bars (lets go)
The definition of a jet setter I'm hip hop still living like a good fella'
Castle and crooks sweater and the queen never trip
She drive away faster than you rook' nigga.
Have you seen adiza with beaches that look like Eva
With D cups or a beach like an H-B-O feature at night
A quarter-pound of sand in my un-released Nike's
Amsterdam high, smoke it all by tonight
Nigga you ain't know about the life
When shit gets heavier than Norbert's wife
We still gotta spit some enormous rhymes
Niggas more than like, and more than likely
When you return home you ignored by the gorgeous wife
Cause she feels slighted and you don't want to fight with her
Cause you tired,
But now it's back to the lab
45 messages right after you land
Feet feel swollen you call for the zanex
And risking your life with the mic in your hand
Ya ya
We on a world tour Wale your man hustlin' in each
And every ghetto with the mic in my hand
New York (New York), VA (VA), DC (DC), get paid (hey)
We on a world tour Wale your man hustlin' in each
And every ghetto with the mic in my hand London (cheers), Tokyo (yeah),
We gon' take you all around the globe, sing to em' shorty.
See J did Scotland and everybody jocked him I did Scotland
And got no props for it
Naw that just fucked up my jay's
Which fucked up my day
Rock walley's on stage
Freeze on willy off, no hotel I'm back on the plane
While they was like go wale
I'm so way ahead of them
I'm unpaved I did justice to Justice one fre'
One thing that you niggas must acknowledge,
I beat beef like the pants on Scottish kilt
Is how it's dealt
I've been overruled more then than Neo Phelps.
It's harder when you by yourself my nigga Bun B good help,
My nigga Ron Fest never think about self cause we think about wealth
Like finch do melf on American Pie
It's hard to have American pride
When most of your money's made out of them lines
The other half is out of them lies
Want to make a nigga like oh fuck
Rewind so much that's it's on her,
Rewind so much that it's over paid em'
And they hate em'
But they wrong for it D.C. no hooges I'm on first
We on a world tour Wale your man hustlin' in each
And every ghetto with the mic in my hand
New York (New York), VA (VA), DC (DC), get paid (hey)
We on a world tour Wale your man hustlin' in each
And every ghetto with the mic in my hand London (London), Tokyo (Tokyo),
We gon' take you all around the globe, sing to em' shorty.
Throw it up, we give it, we give it hard
No half stepping baby this is who we are
Every word, every word coming from my heart
N-n-notes pumpin through my heart
Get wit' it, get wit' it
Let me see your hands if you feel this
We on a world tourÂ ?
I need a hand in the air right now, yeah
We on a world tour Wale your man hustlin' in each
And every ghetto with the mic in my hand
New York (New York), VA (VA), DC (DC), get paid (hey)
We on a world tour Wale your man hustlin' in each
And every ghetto with the mic in my hand London, Tokyo,
We gon' take you all around the globe, sing to em' shorty.
