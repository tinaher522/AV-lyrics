<song artist="Jazmine_Sullivan" title="Don't_Make_Me_Wait">
I don't want your number, boy, just want your body
You can keep the conversation for some other hottie
I got a one-track mind, baby don't worry
No dinner dates or movies, just come on and hurry
It goes left, right, keep it tight, doing things I know you like
Do your job and I just might bring you home another night
It goes left, right, keep it tight, doing things I know you like
Do your job and I just might bring you home
Don't make me wait too long, just play my favorite song
I'll get my Vanity Six on
Don't make me wait too long, just play my favorite song
I'll get my Vanity Six on
Don't need no roses, ain't like them other chicks
If you don't wanna comply then I can find another, oh
Am I a nasty girl or just being honest?
If you think my mouth is bad, baby just watch this
It goes left, right, keep it tight, doing things I know you like
Do your job and I just might bring you home another night
It goes left, right, keep it tight, doing things I know you like
Do your job and I just might bring you home
Don't make me wait too long, just play my favorite song
I'll get my Vanity Six on
Don't make me wait too long, just play my favorite song
I'll get my Vanity Six on
Every girl, around the world
(Every girl can do it, it's all in how you move it, get your Vanity Six on)
(Every girl can do it, it's all in how you move it, get your Vanity Six on)
It goes left, right, keep it tight, doing things I know you like
Do your job and I just might bring you home another night
It goes left, right, keep it tight, doing things I know you like
Do your job and I just might bring you home
Don't make me wait too long, just play my favorite song
I'll get my Vanity Six on
Don't make me wait too long, just play my favorite song
I'll get my Vanity Six on
