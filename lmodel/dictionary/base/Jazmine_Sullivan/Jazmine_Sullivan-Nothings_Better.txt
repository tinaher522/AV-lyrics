(Nothings better)
(Nothings better)
(Nothings better)
[Verse 1]
They say a good one is hard to find
I got a good one and he's all mine
So I'll do whatever it takes yea to keep him here with me
Cause how he love me
(love me)
Touch me
(touch me)
Kiss me
(kiss me)
Love me
(love me)
It ain't a man that I know who glows
He stand in a lane of his own
[Chorus]
When you touch me nothing else compares
I can't wait for you to take me there
Nothings better
Nothings better
Nothings better
Nothings better
No one makes me feel the way you do
What we got between me and you
Nothings better
Nothings better
Nothings better
Nothings better
(Nothings better)
[Verse 2]
Cause I never knew someone like you
To find a love so true
And I ain't ashamed
Cause what you give me can't be replaced no
How you love me
(love me)
Touch me
(touch me)
Kiss me
(kiss me)
Love me
(love me)
It's like I'm living in a wonderland
Forever your girl and you forever my man
[Chorus]
When you touch me nothing else compares
I can't wait for you to take me there
Nothings better
Nothings better
Nothings better
Nothings better
No one makes me feel the way you do
What we got between me and you
Nothings better
Nothings better
Nothings better
Nothings better
[Hook]
Hey yea
Your love takes me higher than I have been before
You've given me so much that I don't need anymore
Hey baby
Please don't change
Loving me this way
You can't be replaced
[Chorus]
When you touch me nothing else compares
I can't wait for you to take me there
Nothings better
Nothings better
Nothings better
Nothings better
No one makes me feel the way you do
What we got between me and you
Nothings better
Nothings better
Nothings better
Nothings better
When you touch me nothing else compares
I can't wait for you to take me there
Nothings better
Nothings better
Nothings better
Nothings better
No one makes me feel the way you do
What we got between me and you
Nothings better
Nothings better
Nothings better
Nothings better
(Nothings better)
(Nothings better)
(Nothings better)
(Nothings better)
