Heyy
[Verse 1]
Don't know if you feel the same
So I keep my thoughts hidden
We both agreed to be friends
But emotions have risen
Wish you would give a sign
That you know how I'm feeling
But until then I'll cry silent tears
(I'l cry silent tears)
Oh, but until then I'll cry silent tears
(I'll cry silent tears) Oh, oh
But until then I'll cry silent tears
(I'll cry silent tears)
[Chorus]
Don't wanna be in this world
Living this life with out you babe
Don't wanna live on this earth
Loving nobody else but you
Don't wanna be in this world
Living this life with out you babe
Don't wanna live on this earth
Loving nobody else but you
[Verse 2]
What we shared together was beautiful
I never felt anything like our essence
But if I can't have you
I'd rather be in your presence
Crying these silent tears (I'll cry silent tears)
Oh, oh, oh
Crying theses silent tears (I'll cry silent tears)
[Chorus]
Don't wanna be in this world
Living this life with out you babe
Don't wanna live on this earth
Loving nobody else but you
Don't wanna be in this world
Living this life with out you babe
Don't wanna live on this earth
Loving nobody else but you
(Nobody but you)
(Cry, cry silent tears) 
Cry I'll keep crying (Cry, cry silent tears)
I'll keep crying (Cry, cry silent tears) 
Crying silent tears (Cry, cry silent tears) 
Oh I'll keep on (Cry, cry silent tears)
Until the day when I decide that I love you
I'll keep on crying (Cry, cry silent tears)
I'll keep on crying (Cry, cry silent tears)
Oh I'm crying inside cause I don't know
If you feel the same way about me
Like I feel about you
(Cry)
Oh, baby
Baby this feeling
Is so strong
Oh and it's so strong
That I can't let you go
I can't let you go
I can't let you go
I can't let you go
I can't let you go
I can't
Let you go...
