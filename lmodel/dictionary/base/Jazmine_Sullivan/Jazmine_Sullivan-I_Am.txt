[Verse]
I look in the mirror
What do I see?
I see my power
My ability
I see tenderness.
Righteousness
Optimism &amp;
A bit of fear
I guess
But no matter what I see
My eyes can't tell me
What I already know
I'm best as what I am &amp;
I don't need nobody to tell me so
[Chorus]
I am a girl
I am a woman
I am connected
To the earth and the sky
I know the secrets
They only dream of
I love myself &amp; I'm gonna tell you why
I am a girl
I am a woman
I am connected
To the earth and the sky
I know the secrets
They only dream of
Girl you are what you are so I am
[Verse]
Everyday I walk the streets
The world &amp; me
It's the perfect company
I watch &amp; I learn as the people pass me by
In my heart I yearn to ask them why
Don't you see the light in your soul?
The strength you have
That can only grow
I know this be soÂ ?
I want only to give it back
This love in me all I see is possibilities
[Chorus]
I am a girl
I am a woman
I am connected
To the earth and the sky
I know the secrets
They only dream of
I love myself &amp; I'm gonna tell you why
I am a girl
I am a woman
I am connected
To the earth and the sky
I know the secrets
They only dream of
Girl you are what you are so I am

[Bridge ]
Your song is my song girl
La La La La La
La La La La La
[Chorus]
Girl
I am a woman
I am connected
To the earth and the sky
I know the secrets
They only dream of
Girl you are what you are so I am
I am a girl
I am a woman
I am connected
To the earth and the sky
I know the secrets
They only dream of
Girl you are what you are so I am
[Chorus 2]
Connected
To the earth and the sky
They only dream of
Girl you are what you are so I am
(Till Faded)
You are what you are
