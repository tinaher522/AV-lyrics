<song artist="Jazmine_Sullivan" title="Good_Enough">
I can put my best dress on, get my hair all done for you
And you still wouldn't say I'm pretty, no
And I can spend my whole life doing everything you asked me to
And you wouldn't appreciate what I'm giving, no, no, no
And if I'm not good enough, then baby there's the door
I bet you, you won't find another who gon' give you more
Baby I don't wanna waste my time changing how you feel
If you don't want me, someone else will
If I'm not, if I'm not good enough
I can fly around the world and back in 80 days
And it's still not fast enough baby
Give you every dime I got, you see it's all for you to take
And you would still walk around like you hate me
All I gotta say is
And if I'm not good enough, then baby there's the door
I bet you, you won't find another who gon' give you more
Baby I don't wanna waste my time changing how you feel
If you don't want me, someone else will
If I'm not, if I'm not good enough
Now I can only do so much
It's a shame that it ain't enough
But I'm tired, so tired
Of trying to give what I ain't got, oh
No I ain't gonna lie, I love ya
But it was never me you wanted
And I'd be a fool to stay with you if you don't want me to
And if I'm not good enough, then baby there's the door
I bet you, you won't find another who gon' give you more
Baby I don't wanna waste my time changing how you feel
If you don't want me, someone else will
If I'm not, if I'm not good enough
And if I'm not good enough, then baby there's the door
I bet you, you won't find another who gon' give you more
Baby I don't wanna waste my time changing how you feel
If you don't want me, someone else will
If I'm not, if I'm not good enough
