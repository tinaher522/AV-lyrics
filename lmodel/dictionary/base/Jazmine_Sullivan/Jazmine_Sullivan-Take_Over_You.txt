<song artist="Jazmine_Sullivan" title="Take_Over_You">
Usually i let yu take the lead
You seem to like that 
When yu hold me down
I tend to fight back 
When i really want yu to touch me
(like ive never been touched before) 
But tonight im not yur passenger
Im your driver
Im not shy boy
No ima ride ya
And i know yull love it 
Cuz im gonna touch ya
(like yu never been touched before) 
Im gonna get freak for my baby
Thats how i let him knw 
He makes me happy . . 
And i dont need nobody else
But him
And he dnt need nobody else 
But me 
I wanna get freak for my baby
Thats how i let him knw 
He makes me happy . . 
And i dont need nobody else
But him
And he dnt need nobody else 
But me 
I wanna take over you 
I wanna make love 
I wanna take over you
I wanna make love 
?Â ? half of me 
And theres no where else id rather be
Than here with you
Oh sweet music (oh sweet music)
And it makes me happy 
Just to knw i make you happy . . 
So tonight i wanna celebrate 
Dedicate
(my love too you)
I wanna take over you 
I wanna make love 
I wanna take over you
I wanna make love 
Let me take care of yu
Rub yur feet and yur shoulders too
Thats the least i can do
Just to show yu 
That i appreciate
And i love the way
That yu make me feel
Baby its real
Im gonna get freak for my baby
Thats how i let him knw 
He makes me happy . . 
And i dont need nobody else
But him
And he dnt need nobody else 
But me 
I wanna get freak for my baby
Thats how i let him knw 
He makes me happy . . 
And i dont need nobody else
But him
And he dnt need nobody else 
But me 
I wanna take over you 
I wanna make love 
I wanna take over you
I wanna make love 
I wanna take over you 
I wanna make love 
I wanna take over you
I wanna make love 
I wanna take over you 
I wanna make love 
I wanna take over you
I wanna make love 
(til fade)
