{t.i}
Only place i wan be is everywhere u gon be
Us apart me don wan see like my heartbeat 
She keepiin me alive saviin me from my demise 
Saparate from me a day &amp; i would've die 
Must ii infusize how much ii love them 
Sexy lips &amp; them pretty eyes
French kissiin them curves &amp; ur hips 
Stay thirsty for them iinner thighs 
When our bodies intervine ii can reconize 
A special connetion that ii 
Would never jerpodize just to socialize 
When ii kno that ii wont survive
No good byes out my emotions 
Ive kno you was dead wrong &amp; ii apologize  
Cuz can no women satisfy me they dont qualified 
Unlike a lot of guys see ii aint gotta liie 
FYI u walkiin out my liife iis liike a homocide 
A man wiith a lot of pride but ii realize 
Ii aint got shiit iif ii aiint got u in my liife 
I want you bad
{Chrous}
Boy I need you bad as my heartbeat, (bad like the food I eat)
Bad as the air I breath, (baby I want you bad)
I need you bad I can't take this pain, (bad I can't take this pain)
Boy I'm 'bout to go insane (baby I need you bad)
I need you,

What I gotta do (baby I want you bad)
I need you,

Do it all for you (baby I need you)

Baby just say the word its watever u choose

{Chrous}
Boy I need you bad as my heartbeat, (bad like the food I eat)
Bad as the air I breath, (baby I want you bad)

You gotta get him back say, oh oh oh oh
