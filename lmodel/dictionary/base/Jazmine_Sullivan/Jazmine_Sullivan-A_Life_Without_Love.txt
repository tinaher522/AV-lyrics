<song artist="Jazmine_Sullivan" title="A_Life_Without_Love">
(Spoken)
I Just Can't Imagine, A Life
Without Love
Coz A Life Without Love
Is A Life Without Purpose
Can't Stop Smiling
And I Feel Like Crying
Left The Heartache
And We All Looking For Something
Tears Flow With No End
But Then He Makes Me Smile Again
My Joy
My Pain
But I Wouldn't Trade It For Nothing
If this Is Love
Never Thought It'd Be This Real
But I
Never Would Have Give It All
If This Is Real
It's Funny How It Makes You Feel
But I
Never Would Have Give It All
If this Is Love
A life without love 6x's
I never imagined this is how the story ends,
Let go expectations, And remember nothings perfect,
Cherish the good days,
And learn from more from mistakes,
Coz, Love is a Journey, But remember that its worth it,
If this Is Love
Never Thought It'd Be This Real
But I
Never Would Have Give It All
If This Is Real
It's Funny How It Makes You Feel
But I
Never Would Have Give It All
If This Is Love
The hurt and the pain,
The Sun and the rain,
It ain't easy, it gets hard but,
I can't see a life without love,
A life without love 8x's
