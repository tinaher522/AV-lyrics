<song artist="Jazmine_Sullivan" title="Best_Friend">
I was sitting in a corner wondering what in the world went wrong.
I was thinking about my best friend.
So I wrote it in this song.
I was meeting her for dinner.
She was waiting across town.
She was minding her own business.
Until somebody shot her down.
How could one take life in ones own hands?
Who told you, you could take the breath that god breathed into man
They could be loved they could be needed
They could even be somebody's world
Like the love, I shared with my best friend
There was a boy standing on the corner
I'd never seen him in my life
Statistics are showing he wont make it through the night
I don't know what I can tell you
To make you understand
Since this killing of young people
Is nothing but the enemies plan
Don't you know...he can be somebody's best friend, someone's lover, someone's ken?
Life shut out with by just a touch, of your feelings and soul
With the pain, comes shattered memories
Oh someone, who was once somebody's best friend
Really really hurt me bad, best friend that I ever had
You don't even know my name, but you hurt me, yeah yeah yeah
You hurt me (hurt me), hurt me (hurt me), made me cry, cry-y-y
Tell me why? Why? Why? Why?
Oh why'd you have to do it to me, why'd you have to do it to me, why'd you have to do it to me
Ohhh you don't even know my name, but you took my best friend
And can you tell me why?
Mmmmm-mm-mm-mm
Like the love, I shared with my best friend (my best friend)
Like the love, I shared with my best....my best friend
My best friend
