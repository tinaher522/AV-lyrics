Mom?
What's the matter, baby?
He did it again, he hit me
He did what?... calm down
I'm gone kill him
Listen to me
I'm gone kill him, I know I'm goin' to
Listen, get your stuff and come home
I can't come home... I'm gone kill him... I'm gone do it
I'm sittin' contemplatin' is it worth, should I take it
Take that shot and change my life
Get that glock and take his life
Hospitals and bloody noses
This would end all, I suppose that I could leave
Knowin' I can't leave
So it's either him or me
Cause he gone kill me if I stay, I know
Gone kill me, he can't change, I know
From the first time that he did it,
Made a promise that he'd quit it, shh
God, it's so much work
Don't wanna end up in a hearse
I guess I gotta do it first
I guess I gotta do it first
I can't go back now, back now I'm runnin'
Away from those cops, I hear them commin'
And if they catch me, I still ain't sorry
If that was wrong just
Call me guilty
Cause if you knew what he did to me
I know I would get your sympathy
So if they catch me, I still ain't sorry
Just lock me up and call me guilty
I did it, pulled the trigger
It wasn't so hard, go figure
Before I did it, I said
This was for all the blood I shed
For all the women who go through this ish
Can't think of what to do, this ish
Done torn them up inside and out
Whose still tryna get out
He gone kill if you stay, I know
I been through this, so yes, I know
I know he promised that he'd quit it
If you believed him girl, forget it shhh
You know I'm right
Don't wanna see him take a life
And it will only just get worse
That's why I had to do it first
I can't go back now, back now I'm runnin'
Away from those cops, I hear them commin'
And if they catch me, I still ain't sorry
If that was wrong just
Call me guilty
Cause if you knew what he did to me
I know I would get your sympathy
So if they catch me, I still ain't sorry
Just lock me up and call me guilty
It's so much blood i grabbed my stuff
But before I could leave, the cops busted in
(You have the right to remain silent)
No I have the right to stay alive
Guess what?, I'd do it again
He would have killed me before I killed him
It would have been him up in this building
It would have been him fakin' tears but what's funny is I'm the one standin' here
I can't go back now, back now I'm runnin'
Away from those cops, I hear them commin'
And if they catch me, I still ain't sorry
If that was wrong just
Call me guilty
Cause if you knew what he did to me
I know I would get your sympathy
So if they catch me, I still ain't sorry
Just lock me up and call me guilty
