(Verse1)
Give me one reason to staaay (reason to stay)
After you did me this waaay
(tell me) tell me that you gonna chaaange
Stop playing these gaaames.. Never be the saaame
Say that you gon do me betterrr(gon do me better).. and that you'll get it togetherrrrr
(boy say) boy say you gon treat me riiiight
Come home every niiiiiight.. Stop tellin your liesss
( Bridge)
Babe you know that I love you.. I want this to work
But lately I feel like u don't put me first
You don't even try like I'm wasting my time
But if you want me to stay baby you gotta change
(Chorus)
(i'm tired of wasting my tears on you)baby you gotta change
(i'm tired of wasting my tears on you)baby you gotta change
(so tired of wasting my tears on you)baby you gotta change
(i'm tired of wasting my tears on you)
OOOH-O-OH
(verse2)
Please say that things gon be different(things gon be different)
You gon stop how you was liiiviiing...
(boy say) say that you gon change your waaays
And it's a new daaay... never be the saaame
Please say that you don't deserve it (you don't deserve it)
And that you gon make it worth iiiit.
(Just say) just say you apologiiiize.. for making me crrrrry..
You know it aint riiiight
( Bridge)
Babe you know that I love you.. I want this to work
But lately I feel like u don't put me first
You don't even try like I'm wasting my time
But if you want me to stay baby you gotta change
( Chorus)
(i'm tired of wasting my tears on you)baby you gotta change
(i'm tired of wasting my tears on you)baby you gotta change
(so tired of wasting my tears on you)baby you gotta change
(i'm tired of wasting my tears on you)
Oooooooooooh-oh
( Breakdown)- instruments
( Bridge)
Babe you know that I love you.. I want this to work
But lately I feel like u don't put me first
You don't even try like I'm wasting my time
But if you want me to stay baby you gotta change
(chorus)
(i'm tired of wasting my tears on you)baby you gotta change
(i'm tired of wasting my tears on you)baby you gotta change
(so tired of wasting my tears on you)baby you gotta change
(i'm tired of wasting my tears on you)
Oooooooooh-oh
