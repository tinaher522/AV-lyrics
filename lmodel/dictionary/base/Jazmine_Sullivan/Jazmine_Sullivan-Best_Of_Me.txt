<song artist="Jazmine_Sullivan" title="Best_Of_Me">
Why can't I, leave him alone?
Break the chains that trap me in, and let him go
Why can't I... just break free?
Can't explain what kind of hold he has on me
(I wanna say no) I wanna say No, but all I say is Yes
(I wanna move on) I wanna move on, and not second guess
(I wanna let go) I wanna let go, but he just gets the best of me
What is this, that makes me weak and fall?
Even tho, it ain't no good at all
What is this, that keeps me here?
When it's brought me so much pain through the years
(I wanna say no) I wanna say no, but all I say is yes
(I wanna move on) I wanna move on, and not second guess
(I wanna let go) I wanna let go, but he just gets the best of me
(Best of me, best of me)
(Don't why, why I stay)
It should be a crime what your doin' to me
(And how u keep, keep me comin' back)
And I don't understand how u do me like that
(But all I do is love you)
When all I should do is leave
But it ain't easy when he's got the best of me
(I wanna say no) I wanna say no, but all I say is yes
(I wanna move on) I wanna move on, and not second guess
(I wanna let go) I wanna let go, but he just gets the best of me
(Best of me, best of me)
(I wanna say no) I wanna say no, but all I say is yes
(I wanna move on) I wanna move on, and not second guess
(I wanna let go) I wanna let go, but he just gets the best of me
(Oh yeah)
