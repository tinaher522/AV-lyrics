<song artist="Jazmine_Sullivan" title="Baltimore">
Beat-up little seagull on a marble stair
Tryin' to find the ocean, lookin' everywhere
Hard times in the city, in a hard town by the sea
Ain't nowhere to run to, there ain't nothin' here for free
Hooker on the corner, waiting for a train
Drunk lying on the sidewalk, sleeping in the rain
And the people hide their faces as they hide their eyes
'Cause the city's dyin' and they don't know why
Oh, Baltimore, ain't it hard just to live?
Oh, Baltimore, ain't it hard just to live?
Just to live
Get my sister Sandy and my little brother Ray
Buy a big old wagon to haul us all away
Live out in the country where the mountain's high
I'm never gonna come back here 'till the day I die
Oh, Baltimore, ain't it hard just to live?
Oh, Baltimore, ain't it hard just to live?
Just to live
But best believe
We're gonna make it somehow
Hard living in the city
