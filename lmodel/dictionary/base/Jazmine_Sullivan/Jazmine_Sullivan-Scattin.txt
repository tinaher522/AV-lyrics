Before you came
My life was so empty
I played the game
But I lost every time
But now that yu
Yur in my life
The things yu do
Give me a reason to smile
And I wouldn't trade it for nothin in this world
All the riches in fact don't mean nothin
Just glad to be yur girl
Cars yu can have it
Crib you  can have it
Money you can have that too
Jewels yu can have it
Clothes yu can have it
Cuz all I need is yu
I can not repay you for the way
You be lovin me
I just wanna thank yu
For bringing out the best in me
Hey hey baby
Yu brought the sun
In my life
No other one
Can give me all I need
With yu I feel
So complete
I knw it's real
Cuz it was meant for me
And I wouldn't trade it for nothin in this world
All the riches in fact don't mean nothin
Just glad to be yur girl
Cars yu can have it
Crib you  can have it
Money you can have that too
Jewels yu can have it
Clothes yu can have it
Cuz all I need is yu
I can not repay you for the way
You be lovin me
I just wanna thank yu
For bringing out the best in me
Hey hey baby
I can not repay you for the way
You be lovin me
I just wanna thank yu
For bringing out the best in me
Hey hey baby
