<song artist="Jazmine_Sullivan" title="Live_A_Lie">
How you gon' do that to me...?
I can't believe this...
I wish I never ever got drunk that night
Made me foolish enough to come to your crib
Walked up the stairs and then I turned on the lights
Couldn't even speak because it happened so quick
I wish I never saw your punk ass that night
You always seem to calm me down with your lies
Even though I know better I try and I try
But you always have the perfect alibi
If a lie gon' get me through
I rather not know the truth
If the truth gon' make me cry
I rather just live a lie
If a lie gon' get me through
I rather not know the truth
If the truth gon' make me cry
I rather just live a lie
I wish I never ever saw u that night
Right now I'd still be thinkin' we were OK
I called you just before I got on my flight
I say "I love you," And you tell me the same
If I could go back in time
I never woulda called your phone up
Never woulda dialed your number
Never woulda gotten that drunk
If I could go back in time
I never woulda gotten that tore
Never woulda asked for one more
Never woulda walked through your door
If a lie gon' get me through
I rather not know the truth
If the truth gon' make me cry
I rather just live a lie
If a lie gon' get me through
I rather not know the truth
If the truth gon' make me cry
I rather just live a lie
Easier to live
Like you don't see nuttin'
Even tho it ain't right
Harder to turn over in your bed and he ain't by your side
I think if I didn't walk in that night
And see you with my own eyes
I would still be livin' a lie
Just gotta know
Whatever you do
It's gon' come back to you
I can't believe this...
If a lie go'n get me through
I rather not know the truth
If the truth gon' make me cry
I rather just live a lie
