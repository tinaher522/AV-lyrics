(Girl Talking)
Girl you lyin?? you ain't got Fifty's number!
Do you? If you got it let me see it!
Girl you ain't nothin?!
I wanna get freaky in the a.m.,
But the question right now is, who I want
I gotta choose who get to stay in, 
So many wanna but I gotta pick just one
He gotta be able to last 'til the day end
He ain't leavin unfinished 'til the job is done
So let me see who will make the way in
Cause I'm ready and I really wanna have some fun
(Chorus)
So I get out my little black book
Ran through the pictures and take a look
I get out my little black book ? my, my, my little black book
He could be Andre, Usher, Kevin, Diddy, Kanye, Justin, Devin, Fifty
Who do I choose from my little black book? 
Who, who do I choose from my little black book?
(OOOOOOO, ooooooo, let me see, let me see, let me see now)
Oh Yea (Hey Yeah)
I'm 'bout to play who get to lay in
Got their names in a range from a to z
Don't worry about a chick, cause she hatin?
I can't help that all the boys wanna get with me
Ain't your business who I, I, I'm dating
Cause I get mine everytime I feel the need
So let me see who will make a way in
Let me look through my book, 
Who will it be? (Let me get out?)
(Chorus)
So I get out my little black book
Ran through the pictures and take a look
I get out my little black book ? my, my, my little black book (x2)
He could be Andre, Usher, Kevin, Diddy, Kanye, Justin, Devin, Fifty
Who do I choose from my little black book? 
Who, who do I choose from my little black book?
(OOOOOOO, ooooooo, let me see, let me see, let me see now)
Let me see now, (OOOOOOO, ooooooo, I?mma flip through my book right now)
So I get out my little black book
Ran through the pictures and take a look
I get out my little black book ? my, my, my little black book (x2)
