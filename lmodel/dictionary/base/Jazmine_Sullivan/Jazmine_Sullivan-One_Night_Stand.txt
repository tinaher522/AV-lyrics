<song artist="Jazmine_Sullivan" title="One_Night_Stand">
Usually in the one that's in control and
I'll meet 'em, freak 'em, leave 'em, move onto the next man...
He ain't my man
I must admit I like have some fun
I'll be in love for like a minute and I'm on the run
On the run, on the run, in love for like a minute then I'm on the run
Ohh
Until the day that he caught my eyes
I know I didn't want to play him like them other guys
Other guys, other guys, didn't want to play him like them other guys
You are my kyptonite
You take my powers away
And if I spend the night
You'll probably drive me insane
One night stand, one night stand, he was supposed to be a one night stand
Hey
You are my kyptonite
You take my powers away
And if I spend the night
You'll probably drive me insane
One night stand, one night stand, he was supposed to be a one night stand
Hey
When he looked in my eyes
I knew somethin' was different
He wasn't no beginner
I could tell I couldn't win
Couldn't win, couldn't win, he was no beginner and I couldn't win
I should have walked away
Don't know what made me stay
I knew I played the game
I'm probably gonna pay
Gonna pay, gonna pay, I play the game and now I'm gonna pay
You are my kyptonite
You take my powers away
And if I spend the night
You'll probably drive me insane
One night stand, one night stand, he was supposed to be a one night stand
Hey
So I decided I would try it
Because I couldn't fight it
I would do it so good
I'd have him makin' me pancakes in the morning
Makin' me pancakes in the morning
Yeah
And so I put it down
I mean, I went to town
But he pulled the switch-around
It was me makin' pancakes in the morning
Me makin' pancakes in the morning
You are my kyptonite
You take my powers away
And if I spend the night
You'll probably drive me insane
One night stand, one night stand, he was supposed to be a one night stand
Hey
