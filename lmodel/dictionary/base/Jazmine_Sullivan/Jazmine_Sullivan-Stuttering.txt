<song artist="Jazmine_Sullivan" title="Stuttering">
I ain't usually lost for words
This has got to be a first
And I'm tryna find the reason why I'm
Stu- stu- stu- stuttering
Something funny's happening
I'm at a place I've never been
And there's got to be a reason why I'm
Stu- stu- stu- stuttering
Every time you look my way
Something in me feels so strange
And I'm starting to think you are why I'm
Stu- stu- stuttering
I said hel, hel, hel, hello
And my, my, my, my, my name is
And it's so frustrating 'cause I don't wanna let you down
My mind is racing, but it won't come out
Can't believe that I can't talk
But it's not my fault
'Cause there's something that you do that's got me
Stu- stu- stu- stuttering
There's so much that I wanna say
But something's getting in my way
And I gotta figure out how to stop
Stu- stu- stuttering
I said hel, hel, hel, hello
And my, my, my, my, my name is
And it's so frustrating 'cause I don't wanna let you down
My mind is racing, but it won't come out
Try to breathe but I'm suffocating
Just be me but it's complicated
I wanna tell you who I am, where I'm from
Where I go when I wanna be alone
I want you to know me better
Once I get my thoughts together
It should be so easy to tell you how I'm feeling
But I can't stop stuttering
Stuttering, stuttering
Stu- doo doo doo doo doo
Stuttering
I ain't usually lost for words
This has got to be a first
And I'm starting to think you are why I'm
Stu- stu- stu- stuttering
