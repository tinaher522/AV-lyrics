<song artist="Jazmine_Sullivan" title="Fabric_Of_My_Life">
They said it was only a dream
And dreaming was only for fools
But let me tell you the secret
Dreams are alive just like me and you
Dreams can be real if you let them
Oh the feel, The fabric of our lives, (This is the fabric of our lives)
The touch the feel of cotton
The fabric of my life
Da doo do 
I was a small town girl, with big dreams
Big things were always on my mind
I knew if I believed whatever I wished would come in time.
I never had a doubt, but people doubted my possibilities
But the only one that's in control of my future is me
My dreams are real 'cuz I let them
The touch the feel, the fabric of our lives
The touch the feel of cotton, the fabric of my life
I'm here because of a dream
I'm here 'cuz I believe
And I never gave up, and it's inside of all of us
And dreams can be real if you let them
The touch the feel, the fabric of our lives
The touch, the feel of cotton, the fabric of my life
The touch the feel, the fabric of my life.
The touch the feel of cotton, the fabric of my life
