Ohhhhh uh
Ohhhhh oooh uh
Ohhh oo oo
Hey yee
Verse 1:
Hope she's everything you wanted
Hope she's everything I wasn't
Hope she gives up more than I
Hope she keeps you satisfied
'Cause if you'd sacrifice everything
It better not be in vain
Hope she's all that matters
Hope you two live happily ever after
Hope she always makes you smile
Hope she's really worth your while
'Cause if you'd sacrifice everything
It better not be in vain
Chorus:
Hope you two are meant to be
'Cause I can't see what would take you away
From the life we made
Hope you two are meant to be
'Cause I can't see what would take you away
From the life we made
Oh oh oh oh
Bridge:
Tell me
Is she worth my tears?
Is she worth the years?
Why won't look into my eyes
Don't turn away
Sit here and watch me cry!
Ohhhhh
Hey ey
Hey ey
Hey ey
Chorus:
Hope you two are meant to be
'Cause I can't see what would take you away
From the life we made
Hope you two are meant to be
'Cause I can't see what would take you away
From the life we made
Hope you two are meant to be...
