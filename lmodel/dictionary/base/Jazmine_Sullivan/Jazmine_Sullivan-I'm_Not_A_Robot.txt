<song artist="Jazmine_Sullivan" title="I'm_Not_A_Robot">
Day and night, same routine,
Starting to feel like a machine.
I get dressed and wash up,
At house, grab a coffee and then into the job.
Wait for hours...
Talk around...
The computer and I pass the day,
Realize that we are both the same.
[Chorus:]
Feel like a robot,
Somebody please turn it off!
I'm a about to...
Life like this won't make me free.
I gotta get out of this program,
And find out who I really am;
I'm not a robot!
I'm not a robot!
I'm not a robot!
I'm not a robot!
Somebody turn it off,
Please make it stop!
I'm not a robot!
I'm not a robot!
...go home and make my...
Pick up...the store,
..the same shit and nothing more.
Get there...couch,
Watching T.V. ...
...right for bed...asking for...
[Chorus: x2]
Feel like a robot,
Somebody please turn it off!
I'm a about to...
Life like this won't make me free.
I gotta get out of this program,
And find out who I really am;
I'm not a robot!
I'm not a robot!
I'm not a robot!
I'm not a robot!
Somebody turn it off,
Please make it stop!
I'm not a robot!
I'm not a robot!
