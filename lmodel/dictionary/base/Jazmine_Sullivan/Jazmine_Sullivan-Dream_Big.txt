<song artist="Jazmine_Sullivan" title="Dream_Big">
Ohh
Packin' up my shh... and I'm goin' real far
Goin' off to Hollywood to be a big star
It's nothin' here for me so I gotta move fast
And I'm gettin' on the road and wont never look back
Hey...
I gotta dream big
'Cause when it happens, it's gone happen real big
Yes I feel it, ohh
I gotta move fast
'Cause when it happens, I can't let it go past
Only get one chance
Ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh,
Can't spend another second sittin' on my momma's couch
So if I don't take a chance, I wont ever get out
Some people talk but never do, they just runnin' they mouth
But I mean just what I say and I'm gone show what I'm about, yea
I gotta dream big
'Cause when it happens, it's gone happen real big
Yes I feel it, ohh
I gotta move fast
'Cause when it happens, I can't let it go past
Only get one chance
When it feels like you been waitin' all your life for this second
You'd be a fool to just let it pass, so go and get it
Don't matter near or far, to the moon, the stars
I'll do whatever I need to follow my dreams
I gotta dream big
'Cause when it happens, it's gone happen real big
Yes I feel it, ohh
I gotta move fast
'Cause when it happens, I can't let it go past
Only get one chance
I gotta dream big
'Cause when it happens, it's gone happen real big
Yes I feel it, ohh
I gotta move fast
'Cause when it happens, I can't let it go past
Only get one chance
