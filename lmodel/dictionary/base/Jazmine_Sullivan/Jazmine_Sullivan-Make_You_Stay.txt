<song artist="Jazmine_Sullivan" title="Make_You_Stay">
There's nothing i want more in this world
Then to see you smile
Baby if i was still your girl
I can make you realize
That all the love i have for you
Grows stronger by the day
But you up and ran away
I tried my best to make you stay
I still love you in a thousand ways
Still not enough for me to make you stay
Try to hold you close but you push away
Don't know what i can do to make you stay
What i feel is real this is not a game
Still not enough for me to make you stay
I wanna love you but you run away
Show me what i can do to make you stay
Heaven knows i've tried and i'll try
To be more than fair with you
Ever single time you were feeling down
It was me who pulled you through
What happened to all those promises yea
And all the love we made
Still you up and ran away
I try my best to make you stay
Don't you know there's so many reason why we should be more than friends
Cause you know it's alright together
Don't want this to ever end
Baby can we please find a way to try our love again
I still love you in a thousand ways
Still not enough for me to make you stay
Try to hold you close but you push away
Don't know what i can do to make you stay
What i feel is real this is not a game
Still not enough for me to make you stay
I wanna love you but you run away
Show me what i can do to make you stay
Don't you know there's so many reason why we should be more than friends
Cause you know it's alright together
Don't want this to ever end
Baby can we please find a way to try our love again
I still love you in a thousand ways
Still not enough for me to make you stay
Try to hold you close but you push away
Don't know what i can do to make you stay
What i feel is real this is not a game
Still not enough for me to make you stay
I wanna love you but you run away
Show me what i can do to make you stay
I still love you in a thousand ways
Still not enough for me to make you stay
Try to hold you close but you push away
Don't know what i can do to make you stay
What i feel is real this is not a game
Still not enough for me to make you stay
I wanna love you but you run away
Show me what i can do to make you stay
