<song artist="Jazmine_Sullivan" title="Love_You_Long_Time">
Nobody ever love me, quite like you
Your love is like
I got a real good dude and he loves me a lot
And ain't no other man is gonna take his spot
And I, I'm so happy you're mine
So I'mma love you love time
Let me love, let me love you time
Let me love, let me love you long time
So let me love, let me love you long time
Let me love, let me love you long time
Let me love, let me love you time
Let me love, let me love you long time
So let me love, let me love you long time
Let me love, let me love you long time
I never knew someone like you, oh no
And I never felt the way I do before, before, before
I don't wanna lose ya
Won't ever misuse ya
If you ever left
Babe I swear i would lose it
Maybe I should cool it
I know I'm acting kinda foolish
Nobody ever loved me
I got a real good dude and he loves me a lot
And ain't no other man is gonna take his spot
And I, I'm so happy you're mine
So I'mma love you love time
Let me love, let me love you time
Let me love, let me love you long time
So let me love, let me love you long time
Let me love, let me love you long time
Let me love, let me love you time
Let me love, let me love you long time
So let me love, let me love you long time
Let me love, let me love you long time
This is the sweetest thing I know, for sure (for sure, for sure)
And you, you give me reason, reason to hold on, hold on, hold on
I don't wanna lose ya
Won't ever misuse ya
If you ever left
Babe I swear i would lose it
Maybe I should cool it
I know I'm acting kinda foolish
Nobody ever loved me
I got a real good dude and he loves me a lot
And ain't no other man is gonna take his spot
And I, I'm so happy you're mine
So I'mma love you love time
Let me love, let me love you time
Let me love, let me love you long time
So let me love, let me love you long time
Let me love, let me love you long time
Let me love, let me love you time
Let me love, let me love you long time
So let me love, let me love you long time
Let me love, let me love you long time
