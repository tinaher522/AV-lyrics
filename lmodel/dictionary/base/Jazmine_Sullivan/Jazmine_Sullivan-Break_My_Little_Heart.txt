<song artist="Jazmine_Sullivan" title="Break_My_Little_Heart">
If you could read my mind
You'd know I'm for real this time
I been made a fool so much
Til' I'm scared to fall in love
Please don't be a fool like the rest
Give me a hundred percent
Show me that the others wasn't for me
And you; ll be sure to get the best out of me
(Find a way to turn me on)
If you find a way, maybe we can make a deal
Promise me boy, don't you lead me on
You don't know how I feel
Please promise me
If you knew what I've been through
You would let me not be used
So a few I can't explain
Never thought I'd fall in love again
Feels so right (so right)
Something I been missing all my life
Say you won't do me wrong
