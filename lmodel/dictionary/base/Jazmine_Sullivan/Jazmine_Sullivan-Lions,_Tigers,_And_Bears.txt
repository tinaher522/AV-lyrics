<song artist="Jazmine_Sullivan" title="Lions,_Tigers,_And_Bears">
I'm not scared of lions and tigers and bears, no, I'm not
But I'm scared of loving you
I'm not scared to perform at a sold out affair, that's right
But I'm scared of loving you
Am I the only one who thinks it's an impossible task?
Why it don't last? Is that too much to ask?
Why do we love love
When love seems to hate us?
Sorry if I sound so filled with gloom
You say you care and I know you do
But this is from my experience
And my conclusion only makes sense
Just 'cause I love you and you love me
It doesn't mean that we're meant to be
I can climb mountains, swim 'cross the seas
But the most frightening thing is you and me
I'm not scared of lions and tigers and bears, no, I'm not
But I'm scared of loving you
I'm not scared to perform at a sold out affair, that's right
But I'm scared of loving you
Am I the only one who thinks it's an impossible task?
Why it don't last? Is that too much to ask?
Why do we love love
When love seems to hate us?
Most circumstances, I know my fate
But in this love thing, I don't get the game
Why does it feel like those who give in
They only wind up losing a friend?
Just 'cause I love you and you love me
It doesn't mean that we'll ever be
Fly 'cross the ocean, sing for the queen
But the most frightening thing is you and me
I'm not scared of lions and tigers and bears, oh my
But I'm scared of loving you
I'm not scared to perform at a sold out affair, that's right
But I'm scared of loving you
Am I the only one who thinks it's an impossible task?
Why it don't last? Is that too much to ask?
Why do we love love
When love seems to hate us?
I'm not sure though I'm not sure
But if we never try, we'll never know
It's better to have loved then not to love at all
Not trying is worse than to stumble and fall
And if we do, I'd rather it be with you
'Cause at least there will be sweet memories
Oh, I'm not scared
I'm not scared of lions and tigers and bears, no, I'm not
But I'm scared of loving you
I'm not scared to perform at a sold out affair, that's right
But I'm scared of loving you
Am I the only one who thinks it's an impossible task?
Why it don't last? Is that too much to ask?
Why do we love love
When love seems to hate us?
