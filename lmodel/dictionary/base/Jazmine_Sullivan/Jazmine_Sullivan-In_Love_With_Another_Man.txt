<song artist="Jazmine_Sullivan" title="In_Love_With_Another_Man">
If I could, could forget him
I would, please believe me
And I know that I should throw the towel in
But baby it's not, not that easy, hey
You treat me so much better than him
And if I was sane there'd be no competition
But, I'm in love with someone else
And I'm so sorry
I'm in love with another man
And I know it ain't right
You should go and find someone else
Who could treat you right
Give you the world
Someone who understands the man you are cause
baby you shine so bright
And I would just dim your star
A girl who'll treat you like you treat them
Boy I know there's plenty women
Who would love to have a man like you
But I'm in love with someone else...
I'm so sorry baby
I know I ain't right... no no no no no no
For what I did to you baby
I can't explain why it's him and not you
(No no no no no)
But at the end of the day baby I just don't want to
Cause he ain't no doctor
And we always seem to fight, he got the perfect body
And sometimes he don't even treat me right
Oh but when I'm with him, but when I'm with him
When I'm with him, ain't nobody else like it
I'm so sorry baby that I have to do this to you
But I can't go on pretending
Cause I love him, I love him
And I'm so sorry... Do you hear me?
I'm so sorry but I love that man
I love that man...
He ain't always right, but he's just right for me
I'm in love with another man...
and I'm so sorry... hey
But I love someone else...
