<song artist="Katy_Perry" title="The_Girl_Next_Door">
Got a call from my friend
She saw my picture again in a magazine
We laughed out loud 'cause she said
"Remember when this was all a silly dream?"
Now I wake up every day in a different city
A smile on my face, somebody pinch me
She said, "All the world's a stage"
But girl, you know those cameras and lights
Won't ever change me
I don't drink champagne
When I'm back home with my friends
We sip on tea on the porch
'Cause I'm still the girl next door
No fancy things when I come off tour
I slip back into my jeans
'Cause I'm still the girl next door
It's amazing to hear people singing along
Hear the radio playing my song
I still get butterflies
Still get nervous inside in the spotlight
Now every now and then on a Friday night
Cruising down to the dive bar
We waste the night away
Spend Saturday sleeping in late
Those were the good days
I don't drink champagne
When I'm back home with my friends
We sip on tea on the porch
'Cause I'm still the girl next door
No fancy things when I come off tour
I slip back into my jeans
'Cause I'm still the girl next door
And even when I'm miles away
I'll always have the roots from where I came
'Cause when it all fades away
My home will still be the same
Yeah eh, yeah
I don't drink champagne
When I'm back home with my friends
We sip on tea on the porch
'Cause I'm still the girl next door
No fancy things when I come off tour
I slip back into my jeans
'Cause I'm still the girl next door
