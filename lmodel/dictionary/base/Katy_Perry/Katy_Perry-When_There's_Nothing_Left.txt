<song artist="Katy_Perry" title="When_There's_Nothing_Left">
When there's nothing left to give
I will give you more than I ever gave before
When there's nothing left to say
I'll say it all again 
But until then
And I'll give you my heart 
Say I love you
Say I love you
And I'll give you my heart 
Say I love you
Oh, 'cause I do Jesus
No music to play so I sing you my own song
Come on and sing along
When there's nothing that remains
You still stay the same
You're looking so strong
And I'll give you my heart 
Say I love you
Say I love you
And I'll give you my heart 
Say I love you
Oh, 'cause I do Jesus
When there's nothing left to give
I will give you more than I ever gave before
