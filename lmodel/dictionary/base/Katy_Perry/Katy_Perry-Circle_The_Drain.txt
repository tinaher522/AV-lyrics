<song artist="Katy_Perry" title="Circle_The_Drain">
This is the last time you say 
After the last line you break
It's not even a holiday
Nothing to celebrate
You give a hundred reasons why
And say you're really gonna try
If I had a nickel for every time
I'd own the bank
Thought that I was the exception
I could rewrite your addiction
You coulda been the greatest
But you rather get wasted
You fall asleep during foreplay
'Cause the pills you take are more your forte
I'm not sticking around to watch you go down
Wanna be your lover, not your fucking mother
Can't be your savior, I don't have the power
I'm not gonna stay and watch you circle the drain
Watch you circle the drain, watch you circle the drain
You say it helps you write your rhymes
Whatever helps you sleep at night
You become what you despise
A stereotype
You think you're so rock 'n roll
But you're really just a joke
Had the world in the palm of your hands
But you fucking choked
Shoulda been my teammate
Coulda changed your fate
You say that you love me
You won't remember in the morning
You fall asleep during foreplay
'Cause the pills you take are more your forte
I'm not sticking around to watch you go down
Wanna be your lover, not your fucking mother
Can't be your savior, I don't have the power
I'm not gonna stay and watch you circle the drain
Watch you circle the drain, watch you circle the drain
You fall asleep during foreplay
'Cause the pills you take are more your forte
I'm not sticking around to watch you go down
Wanna be your lover, not your fucking mother
Can't be your savior, I don't have the power
I'm not gonna stay and watch you circle the drain
Watch you circle the drain, watch you circle the drain
Watch you circle the drain, watch you circle the drain
You're going down, you're going down, you're going down
You fall asleep during foreplay
'Cause the pills you take are more your forte
I'm not sticking around to watch you go down
