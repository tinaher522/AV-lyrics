<song artist="Katy_Perry" title="Mannequin">
How do I get closer to you
When you keep it all on mute?
How will I know the right way to love you?
Usually the queen of figuring out
Breaking down the man is no work out
But I have no clue
How to get through to you?
I wanna hit you just to see if you cry
I keep knockin' on wood
Hopin' there's a real boy inside
'Cause you're not a man
You're just a mannequin
I wish you could feel
That my love is real
But you're not a man
I wish I could just turn you on
Put a battery in and make you talk
Even pull a string for you
To say anything
But with you there is no guarantee
Only expired warranty
A bunch of broken parts
And I can't seem to find your heart
I'm such a fool
I'm such a fool
I'm such a fool
This one's outta my hands
I can't put you back together again
'Cause you're not a man
You're just a mannequin
I wish you could feel
That my love is real
But you're not a man
You're just a, a toy
Could you ever be
A real, real boy
And understand?
But you're not a man
If the past is the problem,
Our future could solve 'em, baby.
I could bring you to life,
If you let me inside, baby
This'll hurt, but in the end
You'll be a man
You're not a man
You're just a mannequin
I wish you could feel that my love is real,
A toy, could you ever be a real, real boy?
Understand
But you're not a man
You're not a man,
You're just a mannequin
I wish you could feel that my love is real,
But you're not a man
