<song artist="Katy_Perry" title="Hackensack">
I used to know you when we were young
You were in all my dreams
We sat together in Period One
Fridays at 8:15
Now I see your face in the strangest places
Movies and magazines
I saw you talkin' to Christopher Walken
On my TV screen
I will wait for you
As long as I need to
And if you ever get back to Hackensack
I'll be here for you
I used to work at the record store
Now I work for my dad
Scraping the paint off the hardwood floors
The hours are pretty bad
Sometimes I wonder where you are
Probably in LA
That seems to be where everybody
Else ends up these days
And I will wait for you
As long as I need to
And if you ever get back to Hackensack
I'll be here for you, yeah
I will wait for you
As long as I need to
And if you ever get back to Hackensack
I'll be here for you
And if you ever get back to Hackensack
I'll be here for you
