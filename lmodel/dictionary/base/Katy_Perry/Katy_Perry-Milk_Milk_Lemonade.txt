<song artist="Katy_Perry" title="Milk_Milk_Lemonade">
M-M-M-M-Milk, milk, lemonade
(We got some chocolate)
Milk, milk, lemonade
'Round the back's where chocolate's made
Milk, milk, lemonade
'Round the back's where chocolate's made
Milk, milk, lemonade
'Round the back's where chocolate's made
Milk, milk, lemonade
'Round the back's where chocolate's made
I know you're thirsty, baby, standing in the heat
I've got the juicy fruit, the sweet peaches and cream
You wanna wet your whistle, come and have a drink
(M-M-M-M-Milk, milk)
Ice cold
(M-M-M-M-Milky, milky)
Cool as a cucumber, you're coming on to me
You say I got the ripest melons on the street
My honeydew and your banana make a treat 
(M-M-M-M-Milk, milk)
(M-M-M-M-Milky)
'Cause baby don't you know all the boys are jelly of you?
(But first comes is first serves)
Don't you know that it's all delicious, yummy and new?
(But first comes is first serves)
So bottoms up!
Milk, milk, lemonade
'Round the back's where chocolate's made
Milk, milk, lemonade
'Round the back's where chocolate's made
Milk, milk, lemonade
'Round the back's where chocolate's made
Milk, milk, lemonade
'Round the back's where chocolate's made
You'll have to cut your calories when you're with me
Because my sugar gonna give you cavities
Don't wanna share me 'cause I'm such a tasty treat
(M-M-M-M-Milk, milk)
Yum, yum
(M-M-M-M-Milky, milky)
I'll let you double dip it in your favorite sauce
I'll even let you eat the cherry on the top
You'll beg for seconds in a diabetic shock
(M-M-M-M-Milk, milk)
What?
(M-M-M-M-Milky)
'Cause baby don't you know all the boys are jelly of you?
(But first come is first serve)
Don't you know that it's all delicious, yummy and new?
(But first comes is first serves)
So bottoms up!
Milk, milk, lemonade
'Round the back's where chocolate's made
Milk, milk, lemonade
'Round the back's where chocolate's made
Milk, milk, lemonade
'Round the back's where chocolate's made
Milk, milk, lemonade
'Round the back's where chocolate's made
Open 24 hours, more than 31 flavors to satisfy your craving
I know you're sick of that Kool-Aid, I've got your upgrade
One sip you'll be salivating
Milk, milk, lemonade
'Round the back's where chocolate's made
Milk, milk, lemonade
'Round the back's where chocolate's made
Milk, milk, lemonade
'Round the back's where chocolate's made
Milk, milk, lemonade
'Round the back's where chocolate's made
