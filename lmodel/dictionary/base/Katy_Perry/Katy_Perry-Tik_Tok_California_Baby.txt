<song artist="Katy_Perry" title="Tik_Tok_California_Baby">
Wake up in the mornin' feelin' like P- Diddy (Hey what's up girl)
Grab ma glasses I'm out the door I'm gonna hit the city (Let's go)
Before I leave brush ma teeth with a bottle of Jack
'Cuz when I leave for the night I ain't comin back
I'm talkin pedicure on our toes toes
Tryin on all our clothes clothes
Boys blowin' up our phones phones
Drop top and playin' our favorite CD's
Goin up to the parties
Tryna get a little bit tipsy
[CHORUS]
Don't stop, make it pop
DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, Im'ma fight
Til we see the sunlight
TiK ToK, on the clock
But the party don't stop no
Woah-oh oh oh
Woah-oh oh oh
Don't stop, make it pop
DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, Im'ma fight
Til we see the sunlight
TiK ToK, on the clock
But the party don't stop no
Woah-oh oh oh
Woah-oh oh oh
Katy: 
I know a place 
Where the grass is really greener 
Warm, wet and wild 
There must be something in the water 
Sippin' gin and juice 
Laying underneath the palm trees 
The boys 
Break their necks 
Try'na to creep a little sneak peek 
(at us) 
You could travel the world 
But nothing comes close 
To the golden coast 
Once you party with us 
You'll be falling in love 
Oooooh Oh Oooooh 
California girls 
We're unforgettable 
Daisy Dukes 
Bikinis on top 
Sun-kissed skin 
So hot 
Will melt your popsicle 
Oooooh Oh Oooooh 
California girls 
We're undeniable 
Fine, fresh, fierce 
We got it on lock 
West coast represent 
Now put your hands up 
Oooooh Oh Oooooh
[Justin Bieber]
Oh woooah, oh woooooah, oh wooooah, oh.
You know you love me, I know you care,
You shout whenever and I'll be there.
You are my love, you are my heart
And we will never ever ever be apart.
Are we an item? girl quit playing,
We're just friends, what are you saying.
Said there's another, look right in my eyes,
My first love broke my heart for the first time.
And I was like...
[Chorus]
Baby, baby, baby oooooh,
Like baby, baby, baby noooooooo,
Like baby, baby, baby, ooooh.
Thought you'd always be mine, mine (repeat)
