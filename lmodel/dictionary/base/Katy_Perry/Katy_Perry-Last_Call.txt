<song artist="Katy_Perry" title="Last_Call">
Hello hello I'm searching for a man
With love-filled eyes and them healing hands
Hello hello I've been waiting for so long
Don't disconnect me cause it's my last call
CHORUS(1):
For help
Yeah help
For help
'Cause it's 8-9-9-3-8-3-3 
Come on and listen to me
Take my call, collect my change
'Cause Lord, I'm calling on Your name
Don't wanna leave, don't wanna say goodbye
Still fifteen minutes for my thirty-five
And where's this good in goodbye?
Cause talking to you is bringing me
This life
Yeah life
This life 
Yeah
'Cause it's 8-9-9-3-8-3-3 
Come on and listen to me
Take my call, collect my change
'Cause Lord, I'm calling on Your name
'Cause it's 8-9-9-3-8-3-3 
Come on and listen to me
Take my call, collect my change
'Cause Lord, I'm calling on Your name
This is my last call
