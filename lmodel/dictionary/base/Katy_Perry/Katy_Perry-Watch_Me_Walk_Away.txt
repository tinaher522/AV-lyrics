<song artist="Katy_Perry" title="Watch_Me_Walk_Away">
Don't like it when you call me precious
Coming out, it sound so vicious
Don't like it when you're sympathizing
With your eyes so patronizing
Never say never
You never thought I wouldn't need you
And neither did I
No more co-dependence
No more mending fences
It all leads to bad dreams
And now I'm wide awake
No more psycho-drama
No more of your dirty karma
Believe me I washed my hands clean
Watch me walk away!
Sorry I don't have a tissue
For all your pathetic issues
Sorry I don't feel so sorry
When you touch me
You're in such a hurry
Never say never
You never thought I wouldn't need you
And neither did I
No more co-dependence
No more mending fences
It all leads to bad dreams
And now I'm wide awake
No more psycho-drama
No more of your dirty karma
Believe me I washed my hands clean
Watch me walk away! (no more, no more)
Watch me walk away! (no more, no more)
Watch me walk away! (no more, no more)
La la la la la la la la la la la la, oh
Watch me walk away! (no more)
Just watch me walk away!
La la la la la la la la la la la la
Just watch me walk away!
Watch me walk away!
There's nothing you can say
No more
Just watch me walk away!
No more co-dependence
No more mending fences
It all leads to bad dreams
And now I'm wide awake
No more psycho-drama
No more of your dirty karma
Believe me I washed my hands clean
Just watch me walk away!
