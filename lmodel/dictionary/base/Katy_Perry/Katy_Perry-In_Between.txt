<song artist="Katy_Perry" title="In_Between">
You come over, don't talk
Turn the TV on, off
Disconnected, I'm effected
Better take the call
Showed you pictures of my hometown
A pin could drop from miles down
What's the use in trying to be a girlfriend when I know just what we are?
There's nothing, in common
Except the bed we lay on
I won't be caught between something and nothing
When you know that nothing is for free
'Cause in the end it's me who pulls the covers
And it's empty in between
You're a habit I can't break, disaster to eliminate
What part of "no" do I not understand when you're not good for me?
'Cause I know we will never be some kind of forever
I won't be caught between something and nothing
When you know that nothing is for free
'Cause in the end it's me who pulls the covers
And it's empty in between
'Cause I'm the girl who makes it all of nothing
How did we become a one-night stand?
Hanging on a thread just isn't something
That I want in the end, no
Hey, yeah
Oh, it's empty in between
You come over
Yeah, it's over
Now we know just what we are
I won't be caught between something and nothing
When you know that nothing is for free
'Cause in the end it's me who pulls the covers
And it's empty in between
I'm the girl who makes it all of nothing
How did we become a one-night stand?
Hanging on a thread just isn't something
That I want in the end
No
Oh, it's empty in between
Oh, yeah
Uh huh uh oh
Uh huh uh oh, yeah
Uh huh uh oh
Uh huh uh oh, you know
Uh huh uh oh
