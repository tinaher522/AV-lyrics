<song artist="Katy_Perry" title="One_Of_The_Boys">
I saw a spider, I didn't scream
'Cause I can belch the alphabet just double dog dare me
And I chose guitar over ballet
And I take these suckers down 'cause they just get in my way
The way
You look at me is kinda like a little sister
Rubbed by your goodbyes
And it leaves me nothing but blisters
So I don't wanna be
One of the boys
One of your guys
Just give me a chance to prove to you tonight
That I just wanna be
One of the girls
Pretty in pearls
And not one of the boys
So over the summer something changed
I started reading seventeen
And shaving my legs
And I study Lolita religiously
And I walked right into school
And caught you staring at me
'Cause I know what you know
But now you're gonna have to take a number
It's okay, maybe one day
But not until you give me my diamond ring
'Cause I don't wanna be
One of the boys
One of your guys
Just give me a chance to prove to you tonight
That I just wanna be
Your homecoming queen
Pin-up poster dream
And not one of the boys
I wanna be a flower
Not a dirty weed
I wanna smell like roses
Not a baseball team
And I swear maybe one day
You're gonna wanna
Make out, make out, make out with me
Don't wanna be, don't wanna be, don't wanna be, don't wanna be, don't wanna be...
'Cause I don't wanna be
One of the boys
One of your guys
Just give me a chance to prove to you tonight
That I just wanna be
One of the girls
Pretty in pearls
And not one of the boys
