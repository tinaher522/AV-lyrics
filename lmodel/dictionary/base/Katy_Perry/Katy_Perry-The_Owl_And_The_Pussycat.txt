<song artist="Katy_Perry" title="The_Owl_And_The_Pussycat">
The owl and the pussy cat went to sea in a beautiful pea green boat they took some honey and plenty of money wrapped up in a five pound note. The owl looked up to the stars above, and sang from a small guitar, oh lovely pussy oh pussy my love, what a beautiful pussy you are you are what a beautiful pussy you are. so they sailed away for a year and a day to the land where the palm trees grow, and there in a wood a piggy wig stood with a ring on the end of his nose his nose a ring on the end of his nose. dear pig are you willing to sell for one shilling your ring? said the piggy i will. so they took it away and were married nest day by the turkey who lived on the hill. the dined on mince and slices of quince which they ate with an runcible spoon and hand in hand by the edge of the sand they dance in the light of the moon the moon they danced in the light of the moon.
