<song artist="Katy_Perry" title="Search_Me">
Through this skin You see my heart
Through this laughter You feel my pain
Even through this mask You see my face
For You are the only one who really knows just who I am
And You search me
And You know all the secrets of my heart
And You search me
Revealing the mysteries of who You are
You search me
Growing up never comes easily
In Your hands, Youâ€™re the potter molding me
Then why do I wear this mask and play this game of hide and seek
When You are the only one who really knows just who I am
And You search me
And You know all the secrets of my heart
And You search me
Revealing the mysteries of who You are
You search me
My Father 
My Father
You are my Father 
Oh, and I am Your child
And you hear my cry 
Even at the midnight
And You search me
And You know all the secrets of my heart
And You search me
Revealing the mysteries of who You are
You search me
