<song artist="Katy_Perry" title="Growing_Pains">
You would think that I could find a simple song 
A photograph of mine
To show this public eye what I have to offer
I may not have a PHD 
Or speak in eloquent philosophy
I'm nothing more than simply me you see
What I am trying to say
I'm just a babe in so many ways
I'm still growing, still stretching
Still breaking in these new shoes
Looking for a way to make a mark of my own
I'm just a spring chick, wet behind the ears
It's a part of life so there's no need to fear
These growing pains that I'm going through
I don't regret, I'm not ashamed 
That I haven't yet begun to speaketh ways
As the wisest of men 
Oh, perhaps some day
But for now I'm grateful 
To be a part of the family tree 
While The Man upstairs does His work on me
It's a job that may take eternity to complete
Just when I've learned all I can
Those growing pains up and kick on in again
What I am trying to say
I'm just a babe in so many ways
Time after time 
One more time and again 
Will it ever end?
It's the lessons in our lives that make us wise
But young or old I am told it’s the same
Oh, these growing pains never go away
So I'll just keep on trying
Oh, baby don’t worry about a thing
