<song artist="Katy_Perry" title="Thinking_Of_You">
Comparisons are easily done
Once you've had a taste of perfection
Like an apple hanging from a tree
I picked the ripest one, I still got the seed
You said move on, where do I go?
I guess second best is all I will know
'Cause when I'm with him, I am thinking of you
Thinking of you, what you would do
If you were the one who was spending the night
Oh, I wish that I was looking into your eyes
You're like an Indian summer in the middle of winter
Like a hard candy with a surprise center
How do I get better once I've had the best?
You said there's tons of fish in the water, so the waters I will test
He kissed my lips, I taste your mouth
Oh, he pulled me in, I was disgusted with myself
'Cause when I'm with him, I am thinking of you
Thinking of you, what you would do
If you were the one who was spending the night
Oh, I wish that I was looking into...
You're the best, and yes I do regret
How I could let myself let you go
Now, now the lesson's learned
I touched and I was burned
Oh, I think you should know
'Cause when I'm with him, I am thinking of you
Thinking of you, what you would do
If you were the one who was spending the night
Oh, I wish that I was looking into your eyes
Your eyes, looking into your eyes
Looking into your eyes
Oh, won't you walk through and
Bust down the door and take me away
No more mistakes
'Cause in your eyes I'd like to stay
