<song artist="Katy_Perry" title="Hook_Up">
Oh, sweetheart
Put the bottle down
You've got
Too much talent
I see you
Through those
Bloodshot eyes
There's a cure
You've found it
Slow motion
Sparks you caught that chill
Now don't deny it
But boys will be boys
Oh, yes they will
They don't want
To define it
Just give up the game
And get into me
If you're looking
For thrills
Then get cold feet
Oh, no
I do not
Hook up, up
I go slow
If you want me
I don't come cheap
Keep your thing
In your pants
And your heart
On your sleeve
Oh, no
I do not
Hook up, up
I fall deep
'Cause the more you try
The harder I'll fight
To say good night
I can't cook, no
But i can clean
Up the mess you left
I lay your head down
And feel the beat
As i kiss
Your forehead
This may not
Last but this is now
So love the one
You're with
You wanna chase
But you're chasing
Your tail
Quick fix
Won't ever
Get you well
Oh, no
I do not
Hook up, up
I go slow
So if you want me
I don't come cheap
Keep your thing
In your pants
And your heart
On your sleeve
Oh, no
I do not
Hook up, up
I fall deep
Cause the more
You try
The harder
I'll fight
To say goodnight
Cause i feel
The distance
Between us
Could be over
With a snap
Of your fingers
Oh, oh, oh, yeah
Oh, no
I do not
Hook up, up
I go slow
So if you want me
I don't come cheap
Keep your thing
In your pants
And your heart
On your sleeve
Oh, no
I do not
Hook up, up
I fall deep
Cause the more
You try
The harder
I'll fight
To say goodnight
Oh, sweetheart
Put the bottle down
Cause i don't wanna
Miss out
