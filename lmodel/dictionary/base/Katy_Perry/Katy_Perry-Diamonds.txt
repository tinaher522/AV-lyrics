<song artist="Katy_Perry" title="Diamonds">
I've got people to see
Places to go
Deadlines to meet
A reputation to up hold
Its like a ton of bricks
Breaking on my back
Its like
The force of gravity
In full effect
I got money to burn
And im on the sake
They bet their bomb on me
Cause im their ace of spades
I feel the walls
Getting closer
Im like a bomb
With all red wires
All this pressure
All this pressure
Maybe it means
Im gonna be
All this pressure
All this pressure
Maybe this means
Im gonna be
A diamond
It wont ever bend
A diamond
Cause there ladies
Best friends a diamond
But there
There has to be more
Than what these pirates
Are gambling for
If not for the push
Id probably be a pebble
If not for the pressure
Id be forgotten forever
Just another stone
Skipped upon the water
Drowning fast before
The other failures
I dont wanna be
A distant memory
On your wall
Just another cd
That you burned
And never bought
Am i not worth it to you?
After all that drama
That weve been though?
All this pressure
All this pressure
Maybe it means
Im gonna be
All this pressure
All this pressure
Maybe this means
Im gonna be
A diamond
It wont ever bend
A diamond
Cause there ladies
Best friends
A diamond
But there
There has to be more
Than what these pirates
Are gambling for
Ooh oohh diamond
Ive gotta be a diamond
(im a diamond in the sky
With you standing by
Now catch me if i fall)
Ohhh ohhh ohhhh
Yeah yeah yeah
All this pressure
All this pressure
Oh, i've gotta be
Oh, i've gotta be
All this pressure
All this pressure
Oh, i've gotta be
Oh, i've gotta be
Im a diamond in the sky
With you standing by
Now catch me if i fall
Into the arms of a coma
All this pressure
I've got pressure
Im gonna be a diamond baby
I've gotta be a diamond
Your gonna see
I'm gonna be a diamond
