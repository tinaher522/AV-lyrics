<song artist="Katy_Perry" title="Peacock">
I wanna see your peacock-cock-cock
Your peacock-cock
Your peacock-cock-cock
Your peacock
I wanna see your peacock-cock-cock
Your peacock-cock
Your peacock-cock-cock
Your peacock
Word on the street you got something to show me
Magical, colorful, Mr. Mystery
I'm intrigued for a peek, heard it's fascinating
Words up your sleeve, such a tease, wanna see the show
In 3-D, a movie, heard it's beautiful
Be the judge and my girls gonna take a bow
I want the jaw dropping, eye popping, head turning, body shocking
I want my heart throbbing, ground shaking, show stopping, amazing
Are you brave enough to let me see your peacock?
Don't be a chicken, boy, stop acting like a biatch
I’m a peace out if you don't give me the pay off
Come on, baby, let me see
What you hiding underneath
Are you brave enough to let me see your peacock?
What you waiting for, it's time for you to show it off
Don't be a shy kind of guy, I'll bet it's beautiful
Come on, baby, let me see
What you hiding underneath
I wanna see your peacock-cock-cock
Your peacock-cock
Your peacock-cock-cock
Your peacock
I wanna see your peacock-cock-cock
Your peacock-cock
Your peacock-cock-cock
Your peacock
I wanna see ya
Skip the talk, heard it all, time to walk the walk
Break me off, if you bad, show me who's the boss
Need some goose, stick it loose, come on take a shot
I want the jaw dropping, eye popping, head turning, body shocking
I want my heart throbbing, ground shaking, show stopping, amazing
Are you brave enough to let me see your peacock?
Don't be a chicken, boy, stop acting like a biatch
I’m a peace out if you don't give me the pay off
Come on, baby, let me see
What you hiding underneath
Are you brave enough to let me see your peacock?
What you waiting for, it's time for you to show it off
Don't be a shy kind of guy, I'll bet it's beautiful
Come on, baby, let me see
What you hiding underneath
I wanna see your peacock-cock-cock
Your peacock-cock
Your peacock-cock-cock
Your peacock-cock
Oh my God, no exaggeration
Boy all this time was worth the waiting
I just shed a tear
I am so unprepared
You got the finest architecture
End-of-the-rainbow-looking treasure
Such a sight to see
And it's all for me
Are you brave enough to let me see your peacock?
Don't be a chicken, boy, stop acting like a biatch
I’m a peace out if you don't give me the pay off
Come on, baby, let me see
What you hiding underneath
Are you brave enough to let me see your peacock?
What you waiting for, it's time for you to show it off
Don't be a shy kind of guy, I'll bet it's beautiful
Come on, baby, let me see
I wanna see your peacock-cock-cock
Your peacock-cock
Your peacock-cock-cock
Your peacock
I wanna see your peacock-cock-cock
Your peacock-cock
I wanna see ya
Come on, baby, let me see
What you hiding underneath
