<song artist="Katy_Perry" title="Nothing_Like_The_1st_Time">
The leaves were falling
I was seventeen
We'd been locking lips
Grabbing hips
Smoking cigarettes
We took a drive in your 1990
Had me down from out of town
I was california
Oh my legs were not shaved
And you had dirt between your fingers
They told us to behave
But hey
It's not like riding a bike
It's not like flying a kite
Its not as easy as pie
There's nothing like the first time
Its not like taking a bath
Its not like having a laugh
Its not like reading a  map
There's nothing like the first time
I had seen it in the 
Magazines
We would 
Change the chanel 
On the tv screen
Cuz it's such a sin
What ya did to me
Straight to hell its what they sell
If you've done the deed
Oh but what could be so bad 
Oh if everyone is guilty
I guess we want what we can't have
'cause I've heard
It's not like riding a bike
It's not like flying a kite
Its not as easy as pie
There's nothing like the first time
Its not like taking a bath
Its not like having a laugh
Its not like reading a  map
There's nothing like the first time
Do you remember
Do you remember
Do you remember
Do you remember
La la la la la la
Theres nothing like the first time
La la la la la la
There's nothing like the first time
It's not a walk in the park
Its not a shot in the dark
Its not a juvenile crime
Theres nothing like the first time
It's not like tying the knot
There's no connecting the dots
And in case you forgot
Theres nothing like the first time
Hey yeah yeah yeah
Theres nothing like the first time
Oh oh ohhh
Theres nothing like the first time
Hey ey ey 
Theres nothing like the first time
It's not like reading a map
Oh I can give you that
Theres nothing like the first time
