<song artist="Katy_Perry" title="Trust_In_Me">
How could I see You when I was so blind
How could I grasp You when I was far behind
How could I hear You when I was so deaf
How could I get up when I had been left
But You said don’t worry
For I’ve healed the blind man
And I’ve set the captives free
And You said don’t worry
For all you’ve gotta do
Is put your trust in Me
How could I be clean when I was so dirty
How could I be made whole when I was torn apart
Make me whole 
Make me whole
Make me whole again
