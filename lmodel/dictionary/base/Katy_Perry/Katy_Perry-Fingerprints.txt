<song artist="Katy_Perry" title="Fingerprints">
Voted most likely
To end up on the back of a milk box drink
Looks like I'm letting 'em down
'Cause $7.75
Isn't worth an hour of my hard work and time
When you can't afford half the shit they advertise
Oh I'm worth more than an ex
More than a toe-tagged generation full of regrets
Ohh I won't settle no oh 
Oh I can't settle
I wanna break the mold
Wanna break the stereotype
Fist in the air 
I'm not going down with out a fight
(Chorus)
It's my life 
And I'm not sitting on the sidelines watching it
Pass me by
I'm leaving you my legacy
I gotta make my mark
I gotta run it hard
I want you to remember me
I'm leaving my fingerprints
I'm leaving my fingerprints
I'm leaving my fingerprints on you
Representing you and me
Don't you wanna go down in history 
Rather than end up 
Begging on the streets
Trading undertable favors
For a place to sleep
'Cause I'm worth more than this 
So stop writing prescriptions for more Ritalin
I can focus my attention
I wanna break the mold 
Wanna break the stereotype
Fist in the air 
I'm not going down with out a fight
(Chorus)
It's my life 
And I'm not sitting on the sidelines watching it 
Pass me by
I'm leaving you my legacy
I gotta make my mark
I gotta run it hard
I want you to remember me
I'm leaving my fingerprints
I'm leaving my fingerprints
Don't give up
Don't give in
Build your house on the rock
Oh not in the sand, in the sand, in the sand, in the sand
(Chorus)
It's my life 
And I'm not sitting on the sidelines watching it
Pass me by
I'm leaving you my legacy
I gotta make my mark
I gotta run it hard
I want you to remember me
It's my life 
And I'm not sitting on the sidelines watching it
Pass me by
I'm leaving you my legacy
I gotta make my mark
I gotta run it hard
I want you to remember me
'Cause I'm leaving my fingerprints
I'm leaving my fingerprints
I'm leaving my fingerprints in the END
