<song artist="Katy_Perry" title="Not_Like_The_Movies">
He put it on me, I put it on
Like there was nothing wrong
It didn't fit, it wasn't right
Wasn't just the size
They say you know, when you know
I don't know
I didn't feel the fairytale feeling, no
Am I a stupid girl for even dreaming that I could?
If it's not like the movies
That's how it should be, yeah
When he's the one, I'll come undone
And my world will stop spinning
And that's just the beginning, yeah
Snow White said when I was young "one day my prince will come"
So I wait for that date
They say it's hard to meet your match
Gotta find my better half
So we make perfect shapes
If stars don't align, if it doesn't stop time
If you cant see the sign, wait for it
One hundred percent, with every penny spent
He'll be the one that finishes your sentences
If it's not like the movies
That's how it should be
When he's the one, I'll come undone
And my world will stop spinning
And thats just the beginning
Oh yeah, 'cause I know you're out there
And your, your looking for me, ooh
It's a crazy idea that you were made perfectly for me
You'll see
Just like the movies
That's how it will be
Cinematic and dramatic with the perfect ending
Oh, it's not like the movies
Oh, but that's how it will be, yeah
When he's the one, you'll come undone
And your world will stop spinning
And it's just the beginning
