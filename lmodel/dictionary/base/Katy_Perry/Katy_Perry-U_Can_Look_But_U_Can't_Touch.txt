Oh my god were you looking at her butt?
You're such a good boy &amp; let's keep it the way
You're going out with your guys tonight 
And you can flirt, boy, shut the window displays
They'll get you drunk, misbehave alright? Alright!
Yeah.. I let u walk the line coz u come home every time and I won't never give u reasons not to 
You're such a good boy and let's keep it the way 
Yeah, let's keep it the way *2 
Chorus: 
You can look, but you can't touch 
You can look, don't touch (don't touch), you can look but you can't touch ( aaaaaah) 
You can look, but you can't touch, you can look at her butt (her butt)
You can look, but you can't touch her butt (aaaaah)
Dont touch! Don't even think about it!
I'll b your bad girl, when you came lately tonight, I can treat you &amp; feed your appetite
U wouldn't dare leave me home alone too long and get me thinking something's really wrong
Yeah, I'll let it u draw my line, you'll be the captain every time
I'll let u think you're in control of this shit
You're such a good a boy and let's keep it the way
Yeah, let's keep it the way *2
Chorus * 4
You can look, but you can't touch 
You can look, don't touch (don't touch), you can look but you can't touch ( aaaaaah) 
You can look, but you can't touch, you can look at her butt (her butt)
You can look, but you can't touch her butt (aaaaah)
Dont touch! Don't even think about it!
Us only saying baby *2
You can look, but you can't touch her butt (what?) 
I saw you looking at her butt, it's a J E L L O
You say you get me another drink, but I sawyo u say hello
You think I'm blind, you think I'm deaf, and you think that I'm dumb 
I aint your Helen Keller, honeyÂ !
I'm your number one 
Don't u forget Punk ...
Chorus * 4 
You can look, but you can't touch 
You can look, don't touch (don't touch), you can look but you can't touch ( aaaaaah) 
You can look, but you can't touch, you can look at her butt (her butt)
You can look, but you can't touch her butt (aaaaah)
Dont touch! Don't even think about it!
Look, look, look! Don't touch, don't touch * 3
