<song artist="Katy_Perry" title="Piercing">
Living in fear is not what You had in mind for me
But holding to You is so hard
I cling to what I see
In a world where my emotions
Seem to rule my every move
They will challenge my devotion
To seek and know the truth
You’re piercing me
This self will bleed
You’re killing all of my securities
Lord, help me see the reality
That all I’ll ever need is You
Here in this haze a distant light 
Seems to draw me near
But in the shadow of my doubt
My faith just disappears
In a world where my emotions
Seem to rule my every move
They will challenge my devotion
To seek and know the truth
You’re piercing me
This self will bleed
You’re killing all of my securities
Lord, help me see the reality
That all I’ll ever need is You
