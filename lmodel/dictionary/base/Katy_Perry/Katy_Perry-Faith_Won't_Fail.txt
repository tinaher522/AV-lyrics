<song artist="Katy_Perry" title="Faith_Won't_Fail">
You could throw me in the fire
And I won't be burned
For my faith is your desire
And your love endures
You could throw me in the prison cell
Shackle me up against the rail
But time and time again
My faith won't fail 
For He'll prevail
In the midst of all my trials and tribulations
And He'll prevail
In the midst of all my sin and temptations
He'll prevail
When I fail and He will pick me up
For time and time again My faith won't fail
You could throw me in the lion's den
But they won't harm me
For Your grace surrounds me
And it sets me free
And I can walk upon the water
And I will not drown
For my eyes are set upon You
And no one can bring me down
For He'll prevail
In the midst of all my trials and tribulations
And He'll prevail
In the midst of all my sin and temptations
He'll prevail
When I fail and He will pick me up
For time and time again My faith won't fail
For His angels surround me
And you've poured out this blood covering
And I will walk and not fail
For time and time again My faith won't fail 
For He'll prevail
In the midst of all my trials and tribulations
And He'll prevail
In the midst of all my sin and temptations
He'll prevail
When I fail and He will pick me up
For time and time again My faith won't fail
