Kanye West:
I got a dirty mind, I got filthy ways
I'm tryin' to bathe my A (A) in your milky way (way)
I'm a legend, I'm irreverent, I'll be reverend
I'll be so far u-u-u-u-up, we don't give a fuh-uh-uh
Welcome to the danger zone, step into the fantasy
You are not invited to the other side of sanity
They callin' me an alien, a big-headed astronaut
Maybe it's because your boy Yeezy get ass a lot
Katy Perry:
You're so hypnotizing
Could you be the devil?
Could you be an angel?
Your touch: magnetizing
Feels like I am floating
Leaves my body glowing
They say be afraid
You're not like the others
Futuristic lover
Different DNA
They don't understand you
You're from a whole nother world
A different dimension
You open my eyes
And I'm ready to go
Lead me into the light
Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
Infect me with your love and
Fill me with your poison
Take me, ta-ta-take me
Wanna be your victim
Ready for abduction
Boy, you're an alien
Your touch so foreign
It's supernatural
Extraterrestrial
You're so supersonic
Wanna feel your power
Stun me with your laser
Your kiss is cosmic
Every move is magic
You're from a whole nother world
A different dimension
You open my eyes
And I'm ready to go
Lead me into the light
Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
Infect me with your love and
Fill me with your poison
Take me, ta-ta-take me
Wanna be your victim
Ready for abduction
Boy, you're an alien
Your touch so foreign
It's supernatural
Extraterrestrial
Kanye West:
I know a bar out in Mars
Where they drivin' spaceships instead of cars
Cop a Prada spacesuit about the stars
Getting stupid high straight up out the jars
Pockets on Shrek, rockets on deck
Tell me, what's next: alien sex
I'ma disrobe you, then I'ma probe you
See, I abducted you, so I tell you what to do
I tell you what to do, what to do, what to do
Katy Perry:
Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
Infect me with your love and
Fill me with your poison
Take me, ta-ta-take me
Wanna be your victim
Ready for abduction
Boy, you're an alien
Your touch so foreign
It's supernatural
Extraterrestrial
Extraterrestrial
Extraterrestrial
Boy, you're an alien
Your touch so foreign
It's supernatural
Extraterrestrial
