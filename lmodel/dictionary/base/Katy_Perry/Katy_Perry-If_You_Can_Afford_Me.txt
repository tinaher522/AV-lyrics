<song artist="Katy_Perry" title="If_You_Can_Afford_Me">
If you want me,
The cherry on top,
The pick of the pack,
The crème de la crop,
If you want me you better do better than that tonight
Oh, oh
If you want me, it takes more than a wink,
More than a drink,
More than you think,
If you want me, you're gonna have to break the bank tonight
'Cause some don't have the patience,
Some call me high maintenance
But you pay the bill,
'Cause that's the deal
If you wanna ride,
Just name your price,
And don't play cheap with your heart,
Don't make a bet if you can't write the check
For me, for me,
'Cause I can be bought,
But you pay the cost,
If you can afford me
If you want me, I'm not a piece of ass,
A one night stand, a storage shed,
I think you better walk by tonight,
Oh no
If you want me,
Then stop begging,
I don't put out for charity
If you want me, there's no discount price tonight
But I don't need your dollar bills,
I just want something real,
'Cause nothing's free,
Except loving me
If you wanna ride,
Just name your price,
And don't play cheap with your heart,
Don't make a bet if you can't write the check
For me, for me,
'Cause I can be bought,
But you pay the cost,
If you can afford me
If you want me,
The cherry on top,
The pick of the pack,
The crème de la crop
If you wanna ride,
Just name your price,
And don't play cheap with your heart,
Don't make a bet if you can't write the check
For me, for me,
'Cause I can be bought,
But you pay the cost,
If you can afford...
If you wanna ride,
Just name your price,
And don't play cheap with your heart,
Don't make a bet if you can't write the check
For me, for me,
'Cause I can be bought,
But you pay the cost,
If you can afford me
