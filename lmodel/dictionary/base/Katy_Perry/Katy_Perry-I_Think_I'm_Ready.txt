<song artist="Katy_Perry" title="I_Think_I'm_Ready">
I'm used to opening my own doors and splitting the checks
The introduced me was always just a friend,
I bought a new dress he never noticed
Always falling for these bad boys, such a challenge
I'm getting tired of cleaning up after them
I think I'm ready to be a woman
Oh love
I think I'm ready, ready for it
You were such a surprise, an unexpected gift
Said I was pretty and I believed it
Not really used to all this attention
Told myself I don't deserve you
And this is just a phase
Could I get used to being loved the right way
I want to argue but there is nothing to say
Oh love
I think I'm ready, ready for it, ready for it
Oh love I think I'm ready
'Cause you send me flowers when there's no occasion
Yeah we talk for hours, you still want to listen
Won't hold it against me if I just need you to hold me tonight
My mother always told me that you'd show up one day
(So scared) to feel this way
But love
I think I'm ready, ready for it, ready for it
Oh love
I think I'm ready, ready for it, ready for it
Oh love I think I'm ready
