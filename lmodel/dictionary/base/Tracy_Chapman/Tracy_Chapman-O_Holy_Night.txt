<song artist="Tracy_Chapman" title="O_Holy_Night">
O holy night the stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear savior's birth
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
Till he appeared and the soul felt it's worth
A thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new glorious morn
Fall on your knees
O hear the angels' voices
O night divine
O night when christ was born

O night divine, o night
O night divine
A thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn
Fall on your knees
O hear the angels' voices
O night divine
O night when christ was born
O night divine, o night
O night divine
