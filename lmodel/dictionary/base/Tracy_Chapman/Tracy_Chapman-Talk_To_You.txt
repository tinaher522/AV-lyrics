<song artist="Tracy_Chapman" title="Talk_To_You">
Gotta talk to you, baby,
Talk to you now
Say it isn't too late
Slamming the door, walking out
I got a feeling
Feelings don't lie
Don't let the words escape me now
Escape me now
Escape me now
Gotta talk to you, baby,
Talk to you now
Say it isn't too late
See me again, we'll work it out
I got a feeling
Feelings don't lie
Don't let the words escape me now
Escape me now
Escape me now
Gotta talk to you, baby,
Talk to you now
Say it isn't too soon
See me again, sort it out
I got a feeling
Feelings don't lie
Don't let the words, oh, escape me now
Oh escape me now
Oh escape me now
Oh I got a feeling
Feelings don't lie
Don't let the words,
Don't let the words, don't let the words,
Oh escape me now
Oh escape me now
