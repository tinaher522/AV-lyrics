<song artist="Tracy_Chapman" title="Don't_Dwell">
Don't dwell on the past
Of there was lost and didn't last
That summer bloom is fading fast
But I'm falling for you
Don't dwell on the pain
The tears you've cried and autumn rain
That that weather is here and come again
But I'm waiting for you
Don't dwell on the loss
Fools that were still breaking toss
That winter's heart will spear and double cross
But I'm yearning for you
Don't dwell on the time
Seasons change and so does the clime
That old flame has cooled but I
But I'm burning for you
Yes I am burning for you
Oh I am burning for you
