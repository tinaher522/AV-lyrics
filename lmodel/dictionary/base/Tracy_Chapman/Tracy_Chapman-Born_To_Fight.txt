<song artist="Tracy_Chapman" title="Born_To_Fight">
They're tryin' to take away my pride
by strippin' me of everything I own
They're tryin' to hurt me inside
And make me into a white man's drone
But this one's not for sale
And I was born to fight
I ain't been knocked down yet
I was born to fight
I tell you I'm the surest bet
There ain't no man no woman
No beast alive that can beat me
'Cause I'm born to fight
They're tryin' to dig into my soul
And take away the spirit of my god
They're tryin' to take control
And monitor my every thought
I won't let down my guard
And I was born to fight
I said I ain't been knocked down yet
I was born to fight
I tell you I'm the surest bet
There ain't no man no woman
No beast alive that can beat me
'Cause I'm born to fight
