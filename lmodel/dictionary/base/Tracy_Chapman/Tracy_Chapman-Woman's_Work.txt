<song artist="Tracy_Chapman" title="Woman's_Work">
Early in the morning she rises
The woman's work is never done
And it's not because she doesn't try
She's fighting a battle with no one on her side 
She rises up in the morning
And she works 'til way past dusk
The woman better slow down
Or she's gonna come down hard 
Early in the morning she rises
The woman's work is never done
