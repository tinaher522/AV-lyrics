<song artist="Tracy_Chapman" title="If_You_Wait_For_Me">
If you wait for me      the real name of the song is THE PROMISE
Then I'll come for you
Although I've travelled far
I always hold a place for you in my heart
If you think of me
If you miss me
Once in a while
Then I'll return to you
I'll return and fill that space in your heart
Remembering your touch
Your kiss, your warm embrace
I'll find my way back to you
If you be waiting
If you dream of me
Like I dream of you
In a place that's warm and dark
In a place where I can feel the beating of your heart
Remembering your touch
Your kiss, your warm embrace
I'll find my way back to you
If you be waiting
Oh I've longed for you
And I have desire
To see your face, your smile
To be with you wherever you are
Remembering your touch
Your kiss, your warm embrace
I'll find my way back to you
Please say you'll be waiting
Together again
It would feel so good to be
In your arms
Where all my journeys end
If you can make a promise
If its one that you can keep
I vow to come for you
If you wait for me
And Say you hold 
A place for me 
In your heart
A place for me in your heart
A place for me in your heart
A place for me in your heart
