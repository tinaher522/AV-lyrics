<song artist="Tracy_Chapman" title="Why?">
Why do the babies starve 
When there's enough food to feed the world 
Why when there're so many of us 
Are there people still alone 
Why are the missiles called peace keepers 
When they're aimed to kill 
Why is a woman still not safe 
When she's in her home 
Love is hate 
War is peace 
No is yes 
And we're all free 
But somebody's gonna have to answer 
The time is coming soon 
Amidst all these questions and contradictions 
There're some who seek the truth 
But somebody's gonna have to answer 
The time is coming soon 
When the blind remove their blinders 
And the speechless speak the truth
