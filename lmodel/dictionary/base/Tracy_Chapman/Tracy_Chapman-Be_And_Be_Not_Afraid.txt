<song artist="Tracy_Chapman" title="Be_And_Be_Not_Afraid">
I believe in mistakes and accidents
That the nature of life is chaos and confusion
That man's rules of law and order may not stand
I should be and be not afraid to reach for heaven
I may think that I know the true heart's needs
My pride may bring me low, unable to see
No closer than yesterday, but tomorrow I may stand
Be and be not afraid to reach for heaven
I'll see the black eyed cavalcade, lights on in the morn
I'll run fast and far away, I'll run without stopping
Till heart and feet fail or until I can stand
Be and be not afraid
Be and be not afraid 
Be and be not afraid to reach for heaven
