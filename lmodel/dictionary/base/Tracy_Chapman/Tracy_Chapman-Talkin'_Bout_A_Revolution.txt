<song artist="Tracy_Chapman" title="Talkin'_Bout_A_Revolution">
Don't you know
They're talkin' about a revolution
It sounds like a whisper
Don't you know
They're talkin' about a revolution
It sounds like a whisper
While they're standing in the welfare lines
Crying at the doorsteps of those armies of salvation
Wasting time in the unemployment lines
Sitting around waiting for a promotion
Don't you know
They're talkin' about a revolution
It sounds like a whisper
Poor people gonna rise up
And get their share
Poor people gonna rise up
And take what's theirs
Don't you know
You better run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run
Oh I said you better
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run
Cause finally the tables are starting to turn
Talkin' bout a revolution
Yes finally the tables are starting to turn
Talkin' bout a revolution oh no
Talkin' bout a revolution oh no
While they're standing in the welfare lines
Crying at the doorsteps of those armies of salvation
Wasting time in the unemployment lines
Sitting around waiting for a promotion
Don't you know
They're talkin' about a revolution
It sounds like a whisper
And finally the tables are starting to turn
Talkin' bout a revolution
Yes finally the tables are starting to turn
Talkin' bout a revolution oh no
Talkin' bout a revolution oh no
Talkin' bout a revolution oh no
