<song artist="Tracy_Chapman" title="I_Used_To_Be_A_Sailor">
I used to be a sailor
Who sailed across the seas
But now I'm just an island
Since they took my boat away from me
Oh no 
I don't like being stationary
I like the rocky wavy motions of the sea
I sit and rot behind these padded walls
Hoping one day they'll fall
And set me free 
He wrote his epitaph
He wrote his eulogy
It said "I think that I can die now
For my true love won't come for me"
Oh no 
I don't like being stationary
I like the rocky wavy motions of the sea
I sit and rot behind these padded walls
Hoping one day they'll fall
And set me free 
I used to be a sailor
Who sailed across the seas
But now I'm just an island
Since they took my boat away from me
Oh no 
I don't like being stationary
I like the rocky wavy motions of the sea
I sit and rot behind these padded walls
Hoping one day they'll fall
And set me free 
Set me free
Set me free
Set me free
