<song artist="Tracy_Chapman" title="Wedding_Song">
I've been having dreams and visions
in them you are always standing
right beside me
I reach out for your hand
to see your arms extending
outstretched towards me
For you I don the veil
By your light
others pale by comparison
I place my faith in love
My fate in this communion
I've been having dreams and visions
in them you are always standing
right beside me
I reach out for your hand
to see your arms extending
outstretched towards me
To you I give my pledge
to honor all that's good
in this life we're living
to think not only of myself
but of the greater union
Can I get a witness
there is salvation and rapture for the lonely
can I get a witness
bless this day sacred and holy
sacred and holy
I've been having dreams and visions
in them you are always standing
right beside me
I reach out for your hand
to see your arms extending
outstreched towards me
With you I am revealed
all my shame all my faults and my virtues
behold body mind and spirit 
heart and soul devoted all to you
Can I get a witness
there is salvation and rapture for the lonely
can I get a witness
bless this day sacred and holy
sacred and holy
