<song artist="Tracy_Chapman" title="Get_Up_Stand_Up">
Get up, stand up!
Stand up for your rights! 
Donâ€™t give up the fight!  x4
Most people think 
the great god will come from the skies. 
Take away everything 
and make everybody feel high. 
But if you know what life is worth, 
you will look for yours on earth. 
And now you see the light, 
so stand up for your rights.  
Get up, stand up!  
Stand up for your rights! 
Don't give up the fight!  x4
Oh, I'm sick and tired of your ism-skism game - 
Dying and going to heaven in Jesus' name. 
We know and we understand 
Almighty god is a living man. 
You can fool some people sometimes, 
but you can't fool all the people all the time. 
And now you see the light 
so stand up for your rights!  
 
Get up, stand up!  
Stand up for your rights!
Don't give up the fight! x13
