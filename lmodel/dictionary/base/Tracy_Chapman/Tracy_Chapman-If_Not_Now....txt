<song artist="Tracy_Chapman" title="If_Not_Now...">
If not now then when
If not today then
Why make your promises
A love declared for days to come
Is as good as none
You can wait til morning comes
You can wait for the new day
You can wait and lose this heart
You can wait and soon be sorry
Now love's the only thing that's free
We must take it where it's found
Pretty soon it may be costly
If not now what then
We all must live our lives
Always feeling
Always thinking
The moment has arrived.
