<song artist="Tracy_Chapman" title="Say_Hallelujah">
say hallelujah
throw up your hands
the bucket is kicked
the body is gone
close your eyes 
bow your head
to rest your soul and praise the dead
say hallelujah
throw up your hands
the bucket is kicked 
the body is gone
dry your eyes and stand up right
put a smile on your face
it wouldn't warm us to cry
the sun will rise, the stars will shine
turning day into dusk and night to dawn
we'll pass on but until that time 
say hallelujah
hallelujah
say hallelujah
hallelujah
say hallelujah
throw up your hands
the bucket is kicked 
the body is gone
have mercy
it's a wonderful life
eternal rest for the weary mornest part of tonight
say hallelujah
throw up your hands
the bucket is kicked
the body is gone
wave your hands
but don't say goodbye
we're all gonna meet you on the other side
