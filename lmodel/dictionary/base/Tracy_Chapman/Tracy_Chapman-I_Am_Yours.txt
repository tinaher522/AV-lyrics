<song artist="Tracy_Chapman" title="I_Am_Yours">
When all my hopes 
And dreams have been betrayed
I stand before you
My hands are empty
I am yours
If you are mine
I am yours
If you are mine
When I fall and stumble
Flat on my face
When I'm shamed and humbled
In disgrace
I am yours
If you are mine
I am yours
If you are mine
When voices call me
To question my faith
When misperception
Taints my love with hate
I am yours
If you are mine
I am yours
If you are mine
When time decides
It won't stop for me
When the hawks and vultures
Are circling
I am yours
If you are mine
I am yours
If you are mine
