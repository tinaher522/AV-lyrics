<song artist="Tracy_Chapman" title="Love's_Proof">
I want you, try to forget her
In your heart you know that she'll never
Love you, love you, love you
I want you, try to forget her
She won't call or write you a letter
Of love, love, love's proof
I want you, try to forget her
Give her time, you'll wait forever
For love, oh love, love's proof
It's not in the stars,
It's all in the proofs
Chances and the odds one you love will love
Fall for you, fall for you
I want you, try to forget her
Thinks she's good, I'll be better
Love you, love you, love you
