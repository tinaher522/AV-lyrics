<song artist="Tracy_Chapman" title="Lose_Your_Love">
If I should lose your love
I hope my heart will break
A second just before the feeling goes away
Cold and dark and still
Let that be the state
No heat, no light, no tremor
No welcome for the pain
If I should lose your love
Let my mind draw a blank
A second after all your love's gone away
Silent, calm and clear
Let that be the place
An empty, hollow void
Where nothing is contained
If I should lose your love
This body will be my grave
And from that moment forth
Best I should fade away
To vapor, dust and sand
To drift through time and space
Forever and until all has been erased
