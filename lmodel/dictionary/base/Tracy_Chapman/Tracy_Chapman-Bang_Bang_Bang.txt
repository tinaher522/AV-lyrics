<song artist="Tracy_Chapman" title="Bang_Bang_Bang">
What do you go and do
you go and give the boy a gun
now there ain't no place to run to
ain't no place to run
When the hold in his hand
he feel mighty he feel strong
now there ain't no place to run to
ain't no place to run
One day he may come back
repay us for what we done
then where you gonna run to
where you gonna run
But one fine day
all our problems will be solved
bang bang bang
we shoot him down
Give him drugs and give him candy
anything to make him think he's happy
and he won't ever come for us
he won't ever come
But if he does
and if there's no one else around
bang bang bang
we shoot him down
If he preys only on his neighbors
brothers sisters and friends
we'll consider it a favor
we'll consider justice done
But if he comes for you or me
and we can place a gun in his hand
bang bang bang
we shoot him dead
What you go and do
you go and give the boy a gun
now there ain't no place to run to
ain't no place to run
Now we'll all be at his mercy
if he decides to hunt us down
cause there ain't no place to run to
ain't no place to run
If he wants the chances that you took from him
and nothing that you own
then there'll be no place to run to
there'll be no place to run
And if he finds himself to be
a reflection of us all
bang bang bang
he'll shoot us down
Before you can raise your eyes to read
the writing on the wall
bang bang bang
he'll shoot you down
Before you can bridge the gulf between
and embrace him in your arms
bang bang bang
he'll shoot you down
