<song artist="Tracy_Chapman" title="Taken">
Should I try to take you in?
Another fool brought to the fold
With not a gaze or arms
But deathlike grip to hold
To hold
To hold
To hold
Should I try to take you in?
And hope for the perfect docile pet
Hope that you'll not defile or wreck my home
Sweet home
Sweet home
Sweet home
Here there's only faith no doubt
You can be taken anywhere
Here is where you choose the place
With pleasure and pain in equal share
A refuge for truth and deceit
Where all who come are taken in, taken in
Should I try to take you in?
Pretending what you have not felt
In passion sorrow sleep or death
Eyes closed
Eyes closed
Eyes closed
Eyes closed
Here there's only faith no doubt
You can be taken anywhere
Here is where you choose the place
With pleasure and pain in equal share
A refuge for truth and deceit
Where all who come are taken in, taken in
Should I try to take you in?
Who'll pity me if I forget?
It's said to be and not to be in love
It's to regret
Regret
Regret
Regret
Here there's only faith no doubt
You can be taken anywhere
Here is where you choose the place
With pleasure and pain in equal share
A refuge for truth and deceit
Where all who come are taken in, taken in
Should I try to take you in?
Who'll pity me in my regret?
For those who've never been in love
Need not forget
Forget
Forget
Forget
