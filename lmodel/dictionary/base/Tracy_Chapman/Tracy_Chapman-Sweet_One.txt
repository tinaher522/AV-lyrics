<song artist="Tracy_Chapman" title="Sweet_One">
My sweet one
My sad-eyed little lover
My sweet one
I swear there are no others
But you, but you, but you, but you, but you
Baby
At night-time
Only sometime
I get kind of lonely
And this old roaming heart of mine
It starts searching on it's own, and
I swear my love is true
And I give it all to you
Baby
Well those sweet sad eyes
Don't you know they call me back
Everytime
I try to go astray
And the image of you
Don't you know it always lingers on my mind
Every minute of the day

My sweet one
My sad-eyed little lover
My sweet one
I swear there are no others
But you, but you, but you, but you, but you
Baby
Well those sweet sad eyes
Don't you know they call me back
Everytime
I try to go astray
And the image of you
Don't you know it always lingers on my mind
Every minute of the day
My sweet one
My sad-eyed little lover
My sweet one
I swear there are no others
But you, but you, but you, but you, but you
Baby
