<song artist="Tracy_Chapman" title="House_Of_The_Rising_Sun">
There is a house in New Orleans
they call the Rising Sun
It's been the ruins of many poor boys
And, oh god, I'm one
My mother, she's a tailor
She sews us new blue jeans
My father, he's a gamblin' man
Down in New Orleans
The only thing a gambler needs
A suitcase and a trunk
The only time he's ever satisfied
Is when he's on a drug
I got one foot on the platform
Another foot on the train
I'm goin' back to New Orleans
To wear that ball and chain
Mothers, tell your children
Don't do as I have done
Don't spend your life in sin and misery
In the house of the rising sun
There is a house in New Orleans
They call the Rising Sun
It's been the ruins of many poor girls
And, oh God, I'm one
And, oh God, I'm one
And, oh God, I'm one
