<song artist="Tracy_Chapman" title="Devotion">
If I am right
If I can be
Constant and faithful
You'll fine me
In my devotion
In my devotion
What if you find a fault
Between my purpose and my deeds
And deem me beyond salvation
Judge me to be unworthy
Of your devotion
Of your devotion
If this be obsession deliver me
A passing infatuation in purity deliver me
A test of fidelity deliver me
Deliver me
Deliver me
What if i should find
You're no good for me
What if I can't be strong enough
What if I can't break free
Of my devotion
Of my devotion
