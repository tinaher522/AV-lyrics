<song artist="Kwabs" title="Cheating_On_Me">
Lately I, I've been rolling with the tide
It swept me away, to another place
Lord knows, you ain't seen enough of me
Why did I fall asleep, on a love so deep?
I fell apart when I couldn't see
I was cheating on me
Broke my own heart, when I couldn't see
I was cheating on me
Our love is like a fading melody
A song I should've sung, a note I should've reached
I ruined this, then I find hard to describe
Stayed up so many times, I could've been by your side
I fell apart when I couldn't see
I was cheating on me
Broke my own heart, when I couldn't see
I was cheating on me
Why don't you cry?
You live this life
You live this life
I fell apart when I couldn't see
I was cheating on me
Broke my own heart, when I couldn't see
I was cheating on me
Cheating on me
I fell apart when I couldn't see
I was cheating on me
Broke my own heart, when I couldn't see
I was cheating on me
