<song artist="Kwabs" title="Love_+_War">
I hide my tears in the rain
But it doesn't wash off the pain
I find myself at the bridge where we used to kiss
Go see a riot tonight
That the fear starts to strike
And never replies
You should be my ritual, gravitational force
But I get so scared to let you know the devil in my thoughts
Love and war
Can fill your heart 'till it bursts, lift your feet off the earth
Love and war
Will tear the soul full of hate
Save yourself, save yourself while you can
As I breathe back to your door
It's we never met before
The spinning image of the man you taught to love
I know all your moral shows
I've been in line, I've been in line
I'm terrified
You should be my ritual, my gravitational force
But I get so scared to let you know the devil in my thoughts
Love and war
Can fill your heart 'till it bursts, lift your feet off the earth
Love and war
Will tear the soul full of hate
Save yourself, save yourself while you can
You should be my ritual, gravitational force
You should be my ritual, gravitational force
Love and war
Can fill your heart 'till it bursts
Lift your feet off the earth
Love and war
Will tear the soul full of hate
Save yourself, save yourself
Love and war
Can fill your heart 'till it bursts
Lift your feet off the earth
Love and war
Will tear the soul full of hate
Save yourself, save yourself while you can
