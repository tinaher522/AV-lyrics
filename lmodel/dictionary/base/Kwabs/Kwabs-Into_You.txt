<song artist="Kwabs" title="Into_You">
I've been waiting for a change to come
But where are you when I need sun, my ma ooh my ma
I've been waiting for the clouds to rake
But where are you when I need rain my my ooh my my
Maybe I'm different, maybe I've changed my ways
Maybe I'd show you but it's already too late
I'd be ready
If only you would let me
Now I'm fallin', fallin'
Tryin' all I can to stay high
Could you catch me
If I weren't so heavy?
Cause I'm fallin', fallin'
I'm fallin' into you
We've been doing this for long enough
So where are you when I need love, my my ooh my my
And I'm down on my knees again
Where are you when I feel pain? ..my ma ooh my ma
Maybe I'm different, maybe I've changed my ways
Maybe I'd show you but it's already too late
I'd be ready
If only you would let me
Now I'm fallin', fallin'
Tryin' all I can to stay high
Could you catch me
If I weren't so heavy?
Cause I'm fallin', fallin'
I'm fallin' into you
