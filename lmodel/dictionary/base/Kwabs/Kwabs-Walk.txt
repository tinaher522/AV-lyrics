<song artist="Kwabs" title="Walk">
Gotta slow up, gotta shake this high
Gotta take a minute just to ease my mind
Cause if I don't walk then I get caught out
And I'll be falling all the way down
(Hundred, hundred, hundred)
Hundred headlights making me blind
All of your pleasures catching my eye
If I jump once, then I never think twice
But your temptations make me stay another night
And my senses only lie to me, lie to me
I don't know how I feel so wrapped in me, wrapped in me
I gotta check myself
Before I get what I want to
Find out is not what I thought it was
And you know why I
Gotta slow up, gotta shake this high
Gotta take a minute just to ease my mind
Cause if I don't walk
Then I get caught out
And I'll be fallin' all the way down
Turning my head and shutting my eyes
Doesn't even matter if I'm wrong or right
Cause if I don't walk, I keep messin' around
And I'll be falling all the way down
Tell myself "Leave" while I'm still strong
"Don't look back!" till I'm ten miles gone
And when the road stops, I'm gonna keep on
Until I end up in the place that I belong
But the pressure is pushing me back again
Telling me not to pretend
There isn't any use to even trying to
Get you out of my head
So, I lift my feet off the ground
And I'm gonna walk right up
Gotta slow up, gotta shake this high
Gotta take a minute just to ease my mind
Cause if I don't walk
Then I get caught out
And I'll be fallin' all the way down
Turning my head and shutting my eyes
Doesn't even matter if I'm wrong or right
Cause if I don't walk, I keep messin' around
And I'll be falling all the way down
Won't get caught in the old fly trap
Runaway, runaway, never come back
No way I'm coming down like that
No, no, runaway, runaway!
No
I can't get caught up again!
No way
No, no
Gotta slow up, gotta shake this high
Gotta take a minute just to ease my mind
Cause if I don't walk
Then I get caught out
And I'll be fallin' all the way down
Turning my head and shutting my eyes
Doesn't even matter if I'm wrong or right
Cause if I don't walk, I keep messin' around
And I'll be falling all the way down
I'm gonna walk now
I'm gonna walk now
Yeah
No, no, no
Gonna walk
Yeah
No, no, no, no, no
Yeah
