<song artist="Kwabs" title="Look_Over_Your_Shoulder">
I know what you've done, 
Doesn't matter how you try to hide it, no 
And you can run forever more 
But you're only gonna get trapped inside it 
Oh, no, oh 
You can tryina shout it out in the morning 
You can tryina embrace it in the evening 
But you should listen long &amp; hard to the warning, 
'Cause soon enough that stuff it's gonna get you off 
Better look over your shoulder and 
Make sure that you're not lost 
Better stay out of the shadows 
When you wonder far from home 
Better look over your shoulder, son 
'Cause when you're on your own 
It will creep into your head 
And it will never let you go 
Know where you've been 
Giving in to every temptation, oh 
And you can leave anyway you want 
If you can handle the creation, oh no 
You can tryina shout it out in the morning 
You can tryina embrace it in the evening 
But you should listen long &amp; hard to the warning, 
'Cause soon enough that stuff it's gonna get you off 
Better look over your shoulder and 
Make sure that you're not lost 
Better stay out of the shadows 
When you wonder far from home 
Better look over your shoulder, son 
'Cause when you're on your own 
It will creep into your head 
And it will never let you go
Better look over your shoulder and 
Make sure that you're not lost 
Better stay out of the shadows 
When you wonder far from home 
Better look over your shoulder, son 
'Cause when you're on your own 
It will creep into your head 
And it will never let you go
