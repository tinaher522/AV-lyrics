<song artist="Kwabs" title="Fight_For_Love">
I've never thought it before, now it's all I can see
I don't get no reward, without trading in cruelty
You're asking to suffer, oh, why?
I'll never put the two things together
Might see heaven tonight, might get turned away
There's only one that you want, but that one and the safe
People want each other, oh
But I'll never put the two things together
Why would you Fight For Love?
Why would you pay to hurt yourself?
There's still nothing to hold onto
But your pride
Why would you Fight For Love?
Why can't you fight for something else?
There's still nothing to hold onto
But your pride, oh
You're fearful as hell to what you never had
Walking the streets, throwing good, often bad
When I could be someone for you
Somebody who will hold you together
I give what I can, might be too much
I'll give what I'll need, I'll give you love
And all I'm asking
Is for you to put my whole world together
Why would you Fight For Love?
Why would you pay to hurt yourself?
There's still nothing to hold onto
But your pride
Why would you Fight For Love?
Why can't you fight for something else?
There's still nothing to hold onto
But your pride, oh
Might see heaven
You might get turned away
There's still nothing to hold onto
But why would I, why would I go that way?
Why would I Fight For Love?
Why would I pay to hurt myself?
Yeah, there's still nothing to hold onto
But your pride, yeah
Why would I Fight For Love?
Why can't I fight for something else?
There's still nothing to hold onto
But your pride
