<song artist="Kwabs" title="My_Own">
Fall into me, I got you now
I won't give up, never let you down
Let's get it straight, it's time to choose
I came to play, don't play to lose
You're the next to me
Now can get in the change
I've got the key, latch out the cage
But I want you all for my own
I don't need no other love
There can be no other love
You don't feel no other love
What if I break into your heart?
Open the lactic gone that you got?
What if I hope, and never let it go?
Could you turn around, and say no?
What if I step around out of time?
Could I be got to your mind?
'Cause I want to be in your love alone
I want you all for my own
Put your heart on me tonight
I want you all for my own
Turn your shadows into light
Drop it off, take a trip
Leave the world, that can wreck a ship
Just you and I, no passengers
We can take it off
Every go fast enough
You got all of me, don't love to spare
To much to miss, not enough to share
I want you all for my own
I don't need no other love
There can be no other love
You don't feel no other love
What if I break into your heart?
Open the lactic gone that you got?
What if I hope, and never let it go?
Could you turn around, and say no?
What if I step around out of time?
Could I be got to your mind?
'Cause I want to be in your love alone
I want you all for my own
Put your heart on me tonight
I want you all for my own
Turn your shadows into light
I want you all for my own
Gotta feel to (?)
I want you all for my own
I don't need no other love
There can be no other love
Never believe no other love
'Cause you don't feel no other love
I don't need no other love
There can be no other love
You don't feel no other love
What if I break into your heart?
Open the lactic gone that you got?
What if I hope, and never let it go?
Could you turn around, and say no?
What if I step around out of time?
Could I be got to your mind?
'Cause I want to be in your love alone
I want you all for my own
Put your heart on me tonight
I want you all for my own
Turn your shadows into light
I want you all for my own
Gotta feel to (?)
I want you all for my own, my own, my own
What if I break into your heart?
Open the lactic gone that you got?
What if I hope, and never let it go?
Could you turn around, and say no?
What if I step around out of time?
Could I be got to your mind?
'Cause I want to be in your love
I want you all for my own
