<song artist="Outkast" title="E-Mac_(Interlude)">
From Texas to GA, niggas bleed in your speakerboxx
Playas stand throwed, ho, puttin' diamonds off in ya socks
Blowin' killa, sippin' lean, and droppin' springs
North Dallas, and Aquemini, fool
It's all the same team (Echoes and fades)
It's all the same team
It's all the same team
