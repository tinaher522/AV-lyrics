<song artist="Outkast" title="Morris_Brown">
Whether you like it or not he's back 
D-A double D-Y Fat sacks
Ridin in the cadillac 
Beating like some beat up
The game dun changed out-
kast came to heat it up
Sharp as a tack like i just left the church (clean)
Smart as a tack when the shit don't won't work (mean)
Ridin in the cadillac
Beating like some beat up
The game dun changed out-
kast came to heat it up
and everybody wanna know whats really goin on
is you and 3000 still making songs?
so on and so on
i can o-on and o-on
and on and on and on
Hell yes!
Music makes the world go round
where it goes (where it goes)
ya just don't know (ya just don't know)
my heart is like a marching band
i'm a fan in the stands
yes i am and i'm hollerin hey baby 
sayin hey baby
So baby please don't leave me
Don't you go (don't you go)
Baby no, no, no (baby no, no, no) 
my heart is like a marching band
I'm a fan in the stands
Yes I am and I'm hollerin'hey baby
Sayin' hey baby 
Two dope boyz in the Cadillac still
'Kast with the crown on ya Cadillac Seville
I'll make your wheels of steel stand (still)
Like your DJ got killed
The fire marsh-
Fire marshall
Shut 'er down, time to go!
OutKast royalty by design of logo
Wanna count it out loud?
93, 94, 95, 96
Plus a dime, still that's fire
HOT like the perm on the back of your neck
Left it in too long
Now ya got Cabbage Patch silky 
Ridin' in the Cadillac
Beatin' like some beat it up
The game dun' changed Out-
Kast came to heat it up
Bendin' corners like a crowbar, oh so unique
Got the pedal to the floor, but the 4-door just creeps
Ridin' in the Cadillac
Beatin' like some beat it up
The game dun' changed Out-
Kast came to heat it up
Exotic, melodic melody jep, we got it
Funkin' for the funk of it and everybody want it
*ROOF* You make a nigga put a dog on it
*ROOF* You make a nigga put a dog on it 

Music makes the world go round
where it goes (where it goes)
ya just don't know (ya just don't know)
my heart is like a marching band
i'm a fan in the stands
yes i am and i'm hollerin hey baby 
sayin hey baby
So baby please don't leave me
Don't you go (don't you go)
Baby no, no, no (baby no, no, no)
my heart is like a marching band
I'm a fan in the stands
Yes I am and I'm hollerin'hey baby
Sayin' hey baby 
I'm tippin' my hat off to ya baby
cuz you're so fine, blow my mind
I put in the time
Everybody knows you can't let a pretty one pass you by
Without sayin' hi
I'm so gone over you
Yes it's true
Baby do whatcha you do
My nose is open so wide (so wide, yeah)
Lookin' at you such a pretty sight (so wide, yeah)
My heart is on my sleeve (my sleeve, yeah)
And this is how it sounds to me (this is how it sounds)
Music makes the world go round
where it goes (where it goes)
ya just don't know (ya just don't know)
my heart is like a marching band
i'm a fan in the stands
yes i am and i'm hollerin hey baby 
sayin hey baby
So baby please don't leave me
Don't you go (don't you go)
Baby no, no, no (baby no, no, no)
my heart is like a marching band
I'm a fan in the stands
Yes I am and I'm hollerin'hey baby
Sayin' hey baby 
Baby you and me
We make a musical masterpiece
I travel the land
Me and my band
We bringin' the church back to your feet
So wait baby
Don't leave me, baby
Say wait baby
Don't leave me, baby
Baby you and me
We make a musical masterpiece
I travel the land
Me and my band
We bringin' the church back to your feet
So wait baby
Don't leave me, baby
Say wait baby
Don't leave me, baby
