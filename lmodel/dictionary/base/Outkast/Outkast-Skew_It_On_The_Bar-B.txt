<song artist="Outkast" title="Skew_It_On_The_Bar-B">
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Woo, rah
Old school playas to new school fools
'Kast keep it jumpin' like kangaroos
We skew it on the bar-b we ain't tryin' to lose
Say I'll be goddamned if they done changed the rules
Old school playas to new school fools
'Kast keep it jumpin' like kangaroos
We skew it on the bar-b we ain't tryin' to lose
Say I'll be goddamned if they done changed the rules
Find the common denominator, the nigga numerator
Never know who the hater, niggas cater to your ego
I'm sorry like Atari, who's cousin to Coleco...Vision
Caught a rico back on the street like Chico...DeBarge
He large and got a 'Lac in the garage
Few parts here and there, I declare hard
My Lord, one at Clark, one at Spelman
Both know each other and it's cool you tell when
We step off in the party, women jump for joy
But all the wild niggas schemin' they gon' jump the Boi
For spittin' all the bourgeois, my watch, my car, I'm a star
I'd rather be a comet by far, rah
Old school playas to new school fools
'Kast keep it jumpin' like kangaroos
We skew it on the bar-b we ain't tryin' to lose
Say I'll be goddamned if they done changed the rules
Old school playas to new school fools
'Kast keep it jumpin' like kangaroos
We skew it on the bar-b we ain't tryin' to lose
Say I'll be goddamned if they done changed the rules
Deliver this through your audio, ghetto mafioso
Grow hydro, then bag it up, yo
Price that longevity, suggest make moves slow
Take time grow eight, react nine blow
Hydro slide raw like fuck Renaldo
Fly ride tho, shit lookin' wild dope
Then glide yo, flippin' the page I go
Watch 5-0, jump on my meat ride slow
Watch those, undercovers cop those rock those
Glocks blows leave 'em baggy and collect spot grows
Keep a watch froze, lean on the yacht, wash clothes
Let the chop blow, bag a half a block plot grows, what
Old school playas to new school fools
'Kast keep it jumpin' like kangaroos
We skew it on the bar-b we ain't tryin' to lose
Say I'll be goddamned if they done changed the rules
Old school playas to new school fools
'Kast keep it jumpin' like kangaroos
We skew it on the bar-b we ain't tryin' to lose
Say I'll be goddamned if they done changed the rules
Boi, I bust raps like D-Boys bust gats, shit
We the type of people that don't bury the axe
Or the hatchet, every time we see your link we snatch it
Ridin' round our hood talkin' that dumb shit, your cabbage
Is crack, like plumber's ass and summer's grass
I been in the game for a minute, seen some suckas like y'all passin'
Thinkin' you're light-skinned, aight then, li'l boy why you frightened?
The Dungeon Famliy gon' be here nigga so keep writin'
I gotta hit the source, I need my other half a mic
Beacuse that Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik was a classic, right
College Park, East Pointe and Decatur they got my back, so
We gon' keep on jammin' and stabbin' off in the track
I think its time to bungee but buddy we will be back
And I'm fittin' to put some D's on the 'Lac, know dat
Old school playas to new school fools
'Kast keep it jumpin' like kangaroos
We skew it on the bar-b we ain't tryin' to lose
Say I'll be goddamned if they done changed the rules
Old school playas to new school fools
'Kast keep it jumpin' like kangaroos
We skew it on the bar-b we ain't tryin' to lose
Say I'll be goddamned if they done changed the rules
