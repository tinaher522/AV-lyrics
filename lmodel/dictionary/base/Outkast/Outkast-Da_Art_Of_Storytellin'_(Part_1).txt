Yeah
Somebody hit me the other day for a rendezvous
Was it the bitch that fucked to Goodie and the Dungeon Crew
Let's say her name was Suzy Screw 'cause she screwed a lot
Makin' a nigga hit that chonk at legitimate spots
Not no parks, backseats or things of that nature
Had to hate ya playa, I'm dickin' the hoe down, never said I paid her
Straight laid her, slayed the bitch like Darth Vader, made her
From College Park and Fayetter, all the way down to Decatur
Like Jada, her wig was sharp and sporty, that was shorty
Safe as a snake on eggs in a Beamer 840
It's foggy, I went to the crib to call her but she lost me
My baby mama beeped seven o'clock, it's gonna cost me
But I still wanna cut her though, maybe she had to work
I caught her at the mall, wearin' a real tight skirt
She was fine as fuck, I wanted to sex the hoe up
She said, "Let's hit the parkin' lot so I can sick your duck."
I said, "Cool, I really wanted to cut you, but this'll do.
I gotta pick up my daughter, 'cause my baby mama beeped me too."
She said she understood then everything was kosher
I gave her a Li'l Will CD and a fuckin' poster
It's like that now
It's like that now
You better go get the hump up out your back now
It's about four, five cats off in my 'Lac now
We just shoot game in the form of story raps now
It's like that now, it's like that now
Now Suzy Screw had a partner named Sasha (Sasha) Thumper (Thumper)
I remember her number like the summer
When her and Suzy, yeah they threw a slumber party
But you cannot call it that, 'cause it was slummer
Well, it was more like spend the night
Three in the mornin', yawnin', dancin' under street lights
We chillin' like a villain and a nigga feelin' right
In the middle of the ghetto on the curb, but in spite
All of the bullshit, we on our back starin' at the stars above
(Aww man) Talkin' 'bout what we gonna be when we grow up
I said, "What you wanna be?" She said, "Alive." (hmm)
It made me think for a minute, then looked in her eyes
I coulda died, time went on, I got grown
Rhyme got strong, mind got blown, I came back home
To find Li'l Sasha was gone
Her mama said she with a nigga that be treatin' her wrong
I kept on singin' my song and hopin' at a show
That I would one day see her standin' in the front row
But two weeks later she got found in the back of a school
With a needle in her arm, baby two months due, Sasha Thumper
It's like that now
You better go get the hump up out your back now
It's about four, five cats off in my 'Lac now
We just shoot game in the form of story raps now
It's like that now, it's like that now
It's like that now
You better go get the hump up out your back now
It's about four, five cats off in my 'Lac now
We just shoot game in the form of story raps now
It's like that now, it's like that now
