[Andre Benjamin] 
Never has ev-ery member in one crew been so diverse 
Tryin to outdo the last verse that I birthed, that is my curse 
Your knight in rhyming armor sentimentally slay all grand dragons 
Grab the sharpest No. 2 then I'm stabbin 
Somebody let me a hold a No. 2 pencil cause they testin 
Somebody let me a hold a No. 2 pencil cause they testin 
[Witchdoctor] 
I fly through the night, yeah 
Mixing 'Card with some Sprite, lyrics we put inside ya 
Listen to these A-T-L riders (hooo hooooo!) 
Keep your head straight, the street's full of snakes 
Slithering, making.. deals, delivering 
UHH uh uh, that weed got you shivering 
Paranoia, fifteen hundred go to the lawyer 
after paying his rent, dollars and cents 
They're stealing pit-BULLS, put up a fence 
We movin on, tell the crew it's on 
[Cee-Lo] 
'Kay, here it go 
They call me Sugar Baby Shi-da-loh 
I'm one fourth of the migh-ty 
G-double-O, D-and-the-I-and-the-E, the M-and-the-O 
[Khujo] 
Yo, this ain't no chain to your brain 
Pistol and they gon' bang, plus drain ya 
like some Folgers ? ya now 
Get in touch with your clothes 
[Cee-Lo] 
Tellin ya home 
Anybody disrespect my zone 
we gon' get it on til we get it gone 
And y'all might get it right 
but you gettin in wrong 
Or you gonna get shot and blown 
[Khujo] 
Out here the volume workin ? 
Stankin cops get your skull split 
and gettin with it figuratively 
It's just that I showed them 
now they tried roll out 
Hopin we'd be on, back in the weight room son 
Think of a spot, we'd keep all day 
Choppin for the live spots 
The thug, take your hairy soul 
like ? I withdraw! 
[Big Gipp] 
Yeah, look here, been here 
Dis here's, diss year's 
Get one of the five 
to lay it down round here 
Gold and the platinum all over the walls 
If you ever shake the hook, go and have big balls 
Laid it down hard more than one {fuckin} time 
Go ahead and get it gone, now I'm out my mind 
Went from hubcaps and 30's to the hundred spoke 
People still talkin bout the last rhyme I wrote 
Eighty-seven was the year that I first stepped in 
I'm hollerin at Big D, doin time in the pen, I say 
[Big Boi] 
Whenever the dope boys, done crept in 
Steppin all over your best friends 
No wea-pons, the lyrical lessons 
and smoked out sessions 
The Young and the Restless 
Some of the best in the Dirty South 
and Midwestern, hemisphere 
They wanna be this here, the fate of B-O-I 
gonna run these verses and make you see this here 
{Niggaz} tried to jock it 
I put my plug off in they girl's socket 
Know, the D to the F is gon' forever rock it 
Lock it, down (yeah, yeah) 
[T-Mo] 
The T stands for T-Mo, who's known as a teacher 
SouthWest young brother, bringin the pain through your speaker! 
It's like a disease to fiend for the cheese you need 
Come up and ease the feelin, exhibit and chillin 
while dealin with the devil himself, increase my wealth be 
more than tanktops the average minimum weight 
College brethern, these days done changed the recipe 
Steady taxin, creatively maximize, with proper investments 
Can't be hesitant, with them dead president 
or you lose, or you could lose your ? but no tools 
[Cee-Lo] 
For whateva time I got left, I'ma holla and scream D-F 
For whateva time I got left, I'ma holla and scream D-F 
[Cool Breeze] 
I know a whole lot of brothers in the rap game 
But most of them are in it for the shiny thangs 
They wanna snatch all ten, maybe stack about fo' 
They wanna live in the house but don't want no grass to grow 
See what you need to do is learn the tricks of the trade 
Go to work, put it down, and den get paid 
It's only two of us gon' get caught for makin the sale 
I'm one, and if you the other bro, I can't tell 
Cain't nobody think they come in, and get in the zone 
Tryin to kill fo' birds, with about fifteen stones 
The C stands for Cool Breeze who's known as the champ 
Freddy Calhoun, the coolest cutta at camp 
Ay, my one's and my two's got your whole town shook 
You betta listen to your corner, and watch for the hook 
The C stands for Cool Breeze who's known as the champ 
Freddy Calhoun, the coolest cutta at camp 
Ay, my one's and my two's got your whole town shook 
You betta listen to your corner, and watch for the hook 
You betta listen to your corner, and watch for the hook 
You betta listen to your corner, and watch for the hook! 
The C stands for Cool Breeze who's known as the champ 
Freddy Calhoun, the coolest cutta at camp 
Ay, my one's and my two's got your whole town shook 
You betta listen to your corner, and watch for the hook 
The C stands for Cool Breeze who's known as the champ 
Freddy Calhoun, the coolest cutta at camp 
Ay, my one's and my two's got your whole town shook 
You betta listen to your corner, and watch for the hook 
You betta listen to your corner, and watch for the hook 
You betta listen to your corner, and watch for the hook!
