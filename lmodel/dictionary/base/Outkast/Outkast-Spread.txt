<song artist="Outkast" title="Spread">
[Chorus 1]
I dont want to move too fast but
Can't resist your sexy ass
Just spread - Spread for me 
I can't - I can't wait to get you home
Don't want to come on too strong but
I'll play in you all day long 
Just spread - Spread for me 
I cant - I cant wait to get you home
[Verse 1]
I - I cant be read minds but I can read yours
I think she says that she wants to pour 
Your - your - yourself all over me
What you think 
I could be wrong but pupils dont lie
And if they do by god they must fry
Fry?
You know like electric chair 
The way you stare 
Yeah I'm there you commited the crime
And I am the victim
[Verse 2]
I got an eye out for she that cries out passionately
Who do things backwardly forwardly horizontally
I'm too young to be settling down
Quick to change my mind tomorrow
So now can I borrow your timid torso 
More so than your soul
And it just got to be how I roll
Fuck the rhythm tuck the rhythm
Under your bosom your the prism
Shirley Chisholm was the first
Let's rehearse making a baby
Put in your order
I wanna baby daughter
Dance on the tip of my tongue
Check the cloud until 
There is no more wetness in them
Tell your homegirls that you will send them 
A postcard from 3000 hard
[Chorus 2]
Don't want to make you feel strange 
But dont let these word be in vain 
So spread - spread for me 
I can't - I can't wait to get you home
Nature knows that I want you 
But not unless you want me too
So spread - spread for me 
I can't - I can't wait to get you home 
[Chorus 1]
[Chorus 2]
The Morning After....
