<song artist="Outkast" title="Slump">
Everybody gotta eat
From front to back street, listen, we on a mission
To get right, workin' street corner in the midnight
Picture the scene, these fiends with fire
Ten dollar dreams, scheme for a sack of that, believe that
I'm with whateva like Wheatstraw
Stuck servin' my cocaine raw
Stop 62 off the brick, jump back
Twenty over, now that's more money to get
Slick, we fin to lick on this corner without gettin' caught
But time, keep a-sleepin' and money gettin' short
Plus that crooked cop Brock think we blow sangin' (fuck him)
That why he ride through the hole with the do swingin'
But I make moves, shake them tricks up they shoestrings
Be more precise when we do things
'Cause life like shakin the dice, but I buck back twice
Like five deuce, fo-trey, okay
I'm strickly dressin' dirty dirty
Gone represent it to the t-top
Born and bred up on the street top
Get to the money and the sweet spot
And forever hollerin' "hootie hoo" when we see cops
I'm strickly dressin' dirty dirty
Gone represent it to the t-top
Born and bred up on the street top
Get to the money and the sweet spot
And forever hollerin' "hootie hoo" when we see cops
Shit, cops and robbers, niggaz be bound to get them dollars and cents
They get in a slump like baseball players, when they short on they rent
Anything goin' you ain't knowin' how much money you spent
But in the real world you surrounded by these ladies and gents
Who hang around you 'cause you be buyin' all the weed and all the chicken
Feedin' everybody, smokin' 'em out when you was broke though, they was missin'
Now you ridin' 'bout fo' deep startin' to tear up your suspension
And your baby mama on child support, my fault, forgot to mention
You don't even have a checkin' account, wasn't thinkin' about no pension
I used to work at Steak and Ale, old gold off in the kitchen
Had determination and graduated, now I got the whole rap world fascinated
I wanted a piece of the pie for me and my family so I made it
Continue to sell dope, it's payin the bills so you gon' do it
But legislation got this new policy, three strikes and you're ruined
Now where your crew at?
Yeah
I'm strickly dressin' dirty dirty
Gone represent it to the t-top
Born and bred up on the street top
Get to the money and the sweet spot
And forever hollerin' "hootie hoo" when we see cops
I'm strickly dressin' dirty dirty
Gone represent it to the t-top
Born and bred up on the street top
Get to the money and the sweet spot
And forever hollerin' "hootie hoo" when we see cops
Ay, me and my buddy on the cut and they know we servin' em slabs
We better watch what we doin' and look out for joe nab
And quit re'in-up and standin' on this same old block
Before our gangsta ass partna get both of us shot
Niggaz talkin' 'cause they makin' some flow
But still ain't did nuttin' that ain't been done before
You can't be tryin' to showcase, just put it down for your spot
And improvise and work with that little you got
So I think when I finish sellin' my last sack
I'mma take some of this money, go and give some back
'Cause people wont forget about the time you gave, know what I'm sayin?
And start thinkin' 'bout a path to pave
I'm strickly dressin' dirty dirty
Gone represent it to the t-top
Born and bred up on the street top
Get to the money and the sweet spot
And forever hollerin' "hootie hoo" when we see cops
I'm strickly dressin' dirty dirty
Gone represent it to the t-top
Born and bred up on the street top
Get to the money and the sweet spot
And forever hollerin' "hootie hoo" when we see cops
