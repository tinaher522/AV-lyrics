<song artist="Outkast" title="Life_Is_Like_A_Musical">
(Verse 1: Andre 3000)
Many nights too far or long ago
When life was straight up and cars would move slow [move slow]
And you were cool if you were pigeon-toed
But things have changed [it's ain't so simple]
Now life is a musical
I called big boi on the telephone [ring ring]
I said hey hold up fore we put out another song
Say no matter do what goes down we stand strong
Cause ain't nothin changed [it's simple]
Hey lets make a musical
Based on Fict and Faction
No verse just sorrow and some action [action]
And you got us well to a fraction
Cause things have changed [it's all hood]
The cast go hollywood
(Outro)
Dont let em, dont let em, dont let em, dont let em
Change us, change us, change us, change us
(Repeat four times)
