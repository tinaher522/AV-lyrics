<song artist="Outkast" title="Ghetto_Music">
Whoo, tie me up, don't tie me down
Cut me up, don't let me down
Find, find a way
Find a way to get out, wit out, hit out
You dig in, dig out, you get out
Ghetto musick, ghetto musick
Find a way to get in, to fit in the ghetto
You get out, wit out a dime
Ghetto musick, ghetto musick
Climbing out this hole with a frown on my face
In the place to be, yeah and not to be at the same time
G H E T T O M U S I C K stay down
O U T K A S T just know that we won't play round
If feet don't stank like they stank
Then they can't swallow dat down
Your battleship is sunk
I wish grandma could see us
Find a way to get out, wit out, hit out
You dig in, dig out, you get out
Ghetto musick, ghetto musick
Find a way to get in, the fit in the ghetto
You get out, wit out a dime
Ghetto musick, ghetto musick
I just want you to know, how I feel
Feeling good, feeling great
(How I feel, oh I)
Feeling great, feeling good, how are you?
I just want you to know, how I feel
Feeling good feeling great
(How I feel, oh I)
Feeling great, feeling good, how are you?
Hot tub add to the bony of tony
As my grand mama ettamay here and she show me
How to be the smooth operator
Dominator in the state of Georgia
Hip hops there to destroy ya
Leave a motherfucker open like a foyer
He from the dirt now here come the paranoia
Although you couldn't have jacked the disrespect
The technique, sweat meet, wipe off the sweat
Fight off the shit and flush the waste down
The pipes of my life flow deep into the ground
Why my purpose on the surface of this earth is
Plan it, standards, trust and the purpose
Campaign in vein for the same lame fame
People obtain, you ought to be detained
By the hip hop sheriff, locked up
No possibility of getting out
'Cause the shit you make is killing me
And my ears and my peers
I hear the end is near, no fear we disappear
Then reappear again in a fresh new light
I hope it's peaceful and cloudy
'Cause if it's not we gotta fight like, fight like
G H E T T O M U S I C K stay down
O U T K A S T just know that we won't play round
If feet don't stank like they stank
Then they can't swallow dat down
Your battleship is sunk
I wish grandma could see us
Find a way to get out, wit out, hit out
You dig in, dig out, you get out
Ghetto musick, ghetto musick
Find a way to get in, the fit in the ghetto
You get out, wit out a dime
Ghetto musick, ghetto musick
I just want you to know, how I feel
Feeling good, feeling great
(How I feel, oh I)
Feeling great, feeling good, how are you?
I just want you to know, how I feel
Feeling good, feeling great
(How I feel, oh I)
Feeling great, feeling good, how are you?
