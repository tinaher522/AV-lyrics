[Man] Hey baby.
[Woman] Yeah?
[Man] I know we've been together for a long time, right?
[Woman] Yeah.
[Man] Well, I got one question to ask you.
[Woman] Yes?
[Man] Will you marry me?
[Woman] Yes!
[Man] Good, but I got one mo' question.
[Woman] Yeah?
[Man] Will you sign a pre-numptual agreement?
[Woman] What?!
