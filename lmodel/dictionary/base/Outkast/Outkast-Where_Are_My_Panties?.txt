(andre 3000) the morning after
(girl) what time is it, 7:48 
where where where are my panties? 
oh my god where are my panties
Damn what i don't, he gon think im a hoe
fuck that i liked it
I was drunk and it was my birthday anyway
maybe I should just lay here and let him touch my booty
but he don't even know my name.
(andre 3000)i know she think i think she just some kinda hoe
I don't give a shit about giving it up  on the first night
that just let me know, she know what she want outta life.
What a hell of a god damn way to wake up
ooh that shit was good
Maybe she'll get me some breakfast
She so goddamn sweet,sweet as she wanna be
ooh i just wanna lay in her hair
You can't fall for her, don't fall for it you can't fall for it ice cold
(voice)ice cold
(andre 3000)maybe i'll just roll over and lay on her booty
yeah naw naw naw now just lay here and be cool ice cold
(voice)ice cold
(andre 3000)what what what if she's the one
