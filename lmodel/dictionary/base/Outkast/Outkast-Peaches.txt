Scar
Stages in life, no one said that it was right
But I've got to hustle for the kids
God only knows what I've gone and been
'Til we reach the end
Just stay strong and be a friend
Big Boi
I cram to understand why a woman and a man
Make a plan to enter matrimony, then he takes her hand
Put that ring on her finger, couple of kids in minivans
Standin' in the stands like a fan, watch her little man
Run ball...
And every time you see the family, they look happy
Got her mama and her daddy and I think they got a lil' dog
But daddy had her cat on the side
He would hide her from his ride, decide not to divide
Kept the yam in the (hide), the spouse in the house
Boy it's cheaper to keep her, you fuck around and take a loss
Come up short like Short Dog, cuss words flow like
([Too Short sample:] Motherfucker shit goddamn asshole)
Took my shit ([Too Short sample:] Beeitch!) Fuck!

It was the night that they done dipped and all throughout the palace
That didn't do his part heartbroke or no more marriage
When it happens, you'll be slappin' yourself rememberin'
You coulda remained boyfriend and girlfriend
Now you sittin' in the courthouse, plaintiff and defendant
Pleadin' to the judge you was in it to win it
In the beginnin' was splendid, see, she was grinnin'
And spendin' all of her time wit' the kids
An' in the kitchen, she'd cook
She was fierce on the stove, it was always great
Covered plates in the microwave when I came home late
But now we just debate like some candidates
Damn, I hate friction
Wishin' I had paperwork on the missus, but I didn't
Damn... fuckin' around

Stages in life, no one said that it was right
But I've got to hustle for the kids
God only knows what I've gone and been
'Til we reach the end
Just stay strong and be a friend
Sleepy Brown &amp; Scar
Girl you have to remember
I gotta provide for the family and future
So please stay down and please stay around
'Cause you know that I'm tryin'a change
But it's hard, 'cause I've been this way
Big Boi
Man, you already knew that shit
Scar
Stages in life, no one said that it was right
But I've got to hustle for the kids
God only knows what I've gone and been
'Til we reach the end
Just stay strong and be a friend
