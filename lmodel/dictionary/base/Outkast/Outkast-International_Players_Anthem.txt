(Andre 3000 with "I choose you babe!" in the back)
So, I typed a text to a girl I used to see
Sayin that I chose this cutie pie with whom I wanna be
And I apologize if this message gets you down
Then I CC'd every girl that I'd see see round town and
I hate to see y'all frown but I'd rather see her smiling
Wetness all around me, true, but I'm no island
Peninsula maybe, makes no sense I know, crazy
Give up all this pussy cat that's in my lap no lookin back
Spaceships don't come equipped with rearview mirrors
They dip as quick as they can
The atmosphere is now ripped
I'm so like a Pip, I'm glad its night
So the light from the sun would not burn me on my bum
When I shoot the moon high, jump the broom
Like a premie out the womb
My partner yellin "Too soon! don't do it! Reconsider!
Read some litera - ture on the subject
You sure? F*** it
You know we got your back like chiroprac - tic
If that b**** do you dirty
We'll wipe her a** out and send detergent
Now hurry hurry, go on to the altar
I know you ain't a pimp but pimp remember what I taught ya
Keep your heart 3 stacks, keep your heart
Aye, keep your heart 3 stacks, keep your heart
Man, these girls is smart, 3 stacks, these girls is smart
Play your part
Play your part"
(Pimp C)
Sweet jones
My b**** a choosey lover, never f*** without a rubber
Never in the sheets, like it on top of the cover
Money on the dresser, drive a compressor
Top notch hoes get the most, not the lesser
Trash like to fuck for 40 dollars in the club
F***** up the game, b**** you gets no love
She be cross country givin all that she got
A thousand a pop, I'm pullin Bentleys off the lot
I smashed up the grey one, bought me a red
Every time we hit the parking lot we turn heads
Some hoes wanna choose but them b****es too scary
Your b**** chose me, you ain't a pimp you a fairy
Ooooooohhh Ooooooohhh
I choose you girl
(Bun B)
Baby you been rollin solo, time to get down with the team
Because its greener on that other side if you know what I mean
I'll show you shit you've never seen
The 7 wonders of the world
And I can make you the 8th if you wanna be my girl
When I say my girl I don't mean my woman, that ain't my style
Need a real street stalker to walk a green mile
We pilin up the paper on the dining room table
Cause you able to realize I'm the truth and not a fable
We rockin precious sable, keep that chilla on the rack
What I look like with some thousand dollar shit up on my back
I'm a million dollar mack, need a billion dollar b****
Put my pimpin in your life, watch your daddy get rich
Easy as A be see, simple as 1 2 3
Get down with UGK, Pimp see &amp; be you N be
Cause what's a hoe with no pimp, and what's a pimp with no hoe
Don't be a lame, you know the game and how it goes
We tryin to get chose
OOOooooohhh Ooooooohhh
I choose you girl
(Big Boi)
Eeny mini decisions with precision I pick
Or make my selection on who I choose to be with
Girl don't touch my protection, I know you want it to slip
But slippin is something I don't do, tippin for life? (Mmm mmm!)
That's like makin it rain
Every month on schedule (mmmHhmm!) Let me tell you
Get your parasol umbrella cause its gonna get wetter
Better prepare you for the see-Support
She supposed to spend it on that baby but we see she don't
(Chopped &amp; Screwed)
Ask ask Paul McCartney the lawyers couldn't stop the
Slaughter slaughter of them pockets, had to tie her to a rocket
Send her into outer space, I know he wish he could
Cause he payin 20K a day, that b****is eating good
Like an infant on a double D titty just getting plump
Cause he miscalculated the next to the last pump
(Chopped &amp; Screwed)
Dump dump in the gut, raw from the giddy up
Better chose the right one or pick pick the kiddies up
Ooooohhhhh Ooooooohhh
I chose you girl
IIIIiiii
I chose you baby
