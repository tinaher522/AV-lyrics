<song artist="Outkast" title="Movin'_Cool_(The_After_Party)">
Andre 3000 and Joi:
Movin' cool, movin' cool, cool, movin' cool
I can make a stone cold blind man see a better way
But when I'm around you you don't have much to say
La la la la la whooo
Andre 3000:
You see there will alway be someone taller, darker
Maybe with a little more cheese than I got
But really shawty, you don't need nobody else
HOOK:
You see baby I am
The opening act (the opening act)
The headliner (headliner)
And the after party (after party, after party..)
Joi:
I am all that you'll ever need
I trip on how everybody sees what I am but you
I thought you'd be brave enough to taste my witch's brew
Well I thought I was dealing with a man
But you're a boy, you're a boy, you're a boy
I can give you everything you want
But I can't be your toy
HOOK
Big Boi:
Hey shawty look here for a minute, shawt shawt
Oh my bad my bad excuse me
You corporate America, you corporate America
I meant to say little lady, you look so lovely lyin' in wait
Like a lemon licorice, lollypop
Waiting to be licked, we don't play
But you think you the shit
Was that too harsh for your lobes
Too heavy for your mentality I suppose
Got nerves like kryptonite, Superman couldn't bend those
Kindness kills callous
Like a D-boy movin' 50 p's of that work
From A-town to Dallas, movin' cool
HOOK
