<song artist="Outkast" title="I_Love_The_Way_You_Move">
Boom, boom, boom, heh, heh
Ready for action, nip it in the butt
We never relaxin', Outkast is everlastin'
Not clashin', not at all but see
My nigga went to do a little acting
Now that's for anyone askin', "Give me one pass 'em"
Drip, drip, drop, there goes an eargasm
Now, you cumin' out the side of your face
We tapping right into your memory banks
(Thanks)
So, fickle the tickle, let's see your seat belt fastened
Trunk rattlin' like two midgets in the back seat wrasling
'Speakerboxxx' vibrate the tank
Make it sound like aluminum cans in the back.
But I know y'all wanted that 808
Can you feel that B A S S, bass?
But I know y'all wanted that 808
Can you feel that B A S S, bass?
I like the way you move
I like the way you move
(Whoo!)
I love the way you move
I love the way, I love the way
I love the way you move
I love the way you move
(Whoo!)
I love the way you move
I love the way, I love the way
Then the whole room fell silent
(Shh)
The girls all pause with glee
Turning left turning right hardly looking at me
But I was looking at them, there, there on the dance floor
Now, they got me in the middle feeling like a man whore
Specially the big girl, big girls need love too
No discrimination in this world
So keep your hands off my cheeks
And let me study how you ride the beat, you big freak
Skinny, slim women got the ghetto within them
You can fuck them, lift them, bend them
Give them something to remember
Hail out, timber when you fall through the chop shop
Take a deep a breath and exhale your ex male friend
Boyfriend was boring as hell
Now, let me listen to the stories you tell
And we can make moves like a person in jail on the loco
I like the way you move
I like the way you move
(Whoo!)
I love the way you move
I love the way, I love the way
I love the way you move
I love the way you move
(Whoo!)
I love the way you move
I love the way, I love the way
Hey, baby girl, don't you stop
Come on, baby, dance on the top of me
You so fine, you so fine
(You so fine)
You drive me outta my mind, ooh baby
(My mind, outta my mind)
If I could, I would, just be with you, baby
Ooh 'cause you like me and excite me
And you know you gotta leave, baby, ooo
I like the way you move
(I like the way you move)
I like the way you move
(Ooo, you so sexy baby)
(Whoo!)
I love the way you move
I love the way, I love the way
(Whoo!)
I love the way you move
(I love the way you move)
I love the way you move
(Ooo, you so sexy baby)
(Whoo)
I love the way you move
I love the way, I love the way
I like the way you move
I like the way you move
(Who!)
I love the way you move
I love the way, I love the way
I love the way you move
I love the way you move
(Whoo!)
I love the way you move
I love the way, I love the way
