<song artist="Outkast" title="Dracula's_Wedding">
[verse 1 (Andre 3000)]
You're all I've ever wanted, but I'm terrified of you
My castle may be haunted, but I'm terrified of you
I've cast my spell on millions, but I'm terrified of you
Baby i do this from the ceiling, but I'm terrified of you
[bridge]
I wait my whole life to bite the right one
Then you come along and that freaks me out
So I'm frightened..(oh!).....Dracula's wedding
[Verse 2]
I've never ran from no one, but I'm terrified of you
See my heartbeat is a slow one, but I'm terrified of you
I've been around for ages, but I'm terrified of you
Put my fang across the stage, but yet I'm terrified of you
[Bridge]
(You know I'm terrified) x3
(shhhh here she comes)
[Kelis]
(3000) x4
Give me a chance to dance romance
Don't run, I'm not the sun
So much at stake...... oh! bad choice of words
But I'm not the gun, with silver bullets
And i can count (1 2 3), plus I make great peanut butter
And jelly sandwiches.... Van Helsing
For richer or poorer, through sickness and in health,
Till death do us part, till death do us part
You only live once, well not in our case, cause we live forever
