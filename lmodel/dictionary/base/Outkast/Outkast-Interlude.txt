D.J. Mrs. Boi:
OutKast...
Tea's long...
Tea's strong...
Lastin' long vs. long lastin'...
Education, however, the difference between the two...
Which do U live in, yo'self?...
2 draw a master plan without a flaw...
Somethin' lastin' long leaves a compromising position...,everything that isn't becomes questionable...,unbelieveable,...and becomes weak at some point...done got the strength 2 blow and 2 hit jackin' this joint...
Somethin' long lastin'...
Big Boi &amp; Dre, the duo whose chemistry gave the potion a rare fate, 2 Atlanta boys that came in2 this industry...
For the same ol' boys 2 B OutKast, raps an' OutBlast the peers of the game...
Move with the groove an' don't let the smooth groove fool U....
So it is...believe in the dirty SOUTHERNPLAYALLISTICCADDILAC-funky-ATLIENS,...the kind that makes Aquemini...
Big Boi &amp; Dre presents OutKast...
So get ready 2 bump!...â€”808-style...2 "The Speakerboxxx" and "The Love Below",...2 albums...w/ the same ol' flow...
Now enjoy it.
Me?
Signin' off...A/K/A...Possum Dre...
