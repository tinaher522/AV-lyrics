Oooh
Cool Movin' cool, Movin' cool,
Cool Movin cool Movin' cool Movin cool 
Eyyyy
Hey hey ooo ooo ooo ooo
I can make a stone cold blind man see a better way,
But when I'm around you, you don't have much to say.
La, la, la, la, la, la, whoo, whoo.
Do do do do do do do do do. ooo
Verse 1
[Andre 3000]
You see there will always be someone, taller, darker,
Maybe wit a lil bit mo cheese than I got.
But really shawty you don't need nobody else.
Hook:
Cause baby I am the opening act,
The headliner (headliner) at the after party.
After party, after party, after party, after party.
Verse 2
[Joi]
I am all that you ever need,
I trip on how everybody sees what I am but you you.
I thought you'd be brave enough to taste my bitch's brew.
Well I thought I was dealing with a man, but you're a boy.
You're a boy, you're a boy,
I can give you everything you want, but I can't be your toy.
[Hook](x2)
Verse 3
[Big Boi]
Hey shawty, look here for a minute, shawt, shawt.
Oh, my bad, my bad excuse me.
You corporate America, you corporate America.
I meant to say lil' lady, you look so lovely lying in wait.
Like a lemon licorice, lollypop.
Waiting to be licked, we don't play,
But you think you the shit.
Was that too harsh for your lobes?
Too heavy for your mentality I suppose.
Got nerves like kryptonite,
Superman couldn't bend those.
Kindness kills callous,
Like a D-Boi movin' fifty p's of that work.
From A-Town to Dallas - Movin' Cool.
[Hook]
