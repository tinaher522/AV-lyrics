<song artist="Outkast" title="Peaches_(Intro)">
Yeahh.. mmm mm mmm
That shit sho feel good
Hey playa, dis Peaches
Comin back at ya one mo gen, wit a big whassup
Break out your black love, and your Boone's Farm
As I send it out one more time
For East Pointe, College Park, Decatur, and the SWATS
We got that Southern playalisticadillac funky muzik for yo' trunk
And it's fat like hambone, and tight like mad booty
So let me take you deep, straight to the point
Cause it ain't nuttin but King Shit, all day, everyday
