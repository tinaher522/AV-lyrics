<song artist="Outkast" title="Southernplayalisticadillacmuzi">
Well, it's the M, I, crooked letter coming around the south
Rolling straight hammers and vogues in that old southern slouch
Please ain't nothing but innocence in my atmosphere
I'm bending corners in my 'Lac Boi 'cause that's how we be rolling here
Deep the slang is in effect because it's Georgia
Kicking they khakis and I feel it's like in your reefers
'Cause you s'posed to cousin, catfish and grits is how my flow flow
Rolling steady in that Caddy but them 50 bottles got to go
See juice and gin used to be my friend from the beginning
And now I'm just a player sipping sauce, every now and then
To catch a buzz like a bumble bee, niggaz who tried to fuck with me
Get sprayed like Raid 'cause it ain't nothing see
My heat is in the trunk along with that quad knock
No my heart don't pump no Kool-Aid, stopping you'll get too sprayed
Hooray, yo block the one and only Outkast
Many a nigga falling fast and how you think you last in
Quickly they ain't gone get me, got something fo'em
The devil up in yo grill and you still don't even know 'em
Show 'em, who's the okay
Like collard greens and whole eggs
I got soul, that's something that you ain't got
That's why yo style is rotten, stop in the land of ATL
Where nothing but pimps, fully equipped
Quick to make a sale, swell
Rolling got my pocket fitness booming light
Rocket smoke tried to stop me
But they know that it's that
It's that southernplayalisticadillacfunkymuzik
Now players if you choose it
You better make sure you don't abuse it
We're gonna get cha high, high
Time to drop these bows like dusty Rhodes, then I yell ho
We knocking 'em off they feet like a southern hustler supposed
To do, I's in the house, house like, a joint is lit fo my kin folks
And all the niggas that was down, since we been broke
Taking 'em deeper than a submarine
So scream when you hear the team of two
My groove be thick as two fat hoes sitting off in a room
I'm packing my tag backwards if you wanna be acting wrong
Word is bond like super glue
It's funky like poopa scoop
And every word I say you can true
Well, okey dokey kastout
I swear to God I got the highest booming Cadillac
The expialalistic Coupe de ville
Can you handle that you rat?
I take my time cruising 'round the city malls
And under my seat for you suckers it's your final curtain call
The one two to the gauge P U M P
You wanna do a jack I heat the barrel till this hippi get me
See I get friendly getting in where I fit
Organized is on the track with the southernplayalistic shit
So copy my slang and bite my shit but don't try heckling me
'Cause sleeping you'll get served with some southern hospitality
It's that southerplayalisticcaddilacfunkymusic
Now players if you choose it
You better make sure you don't abuse it
We're gonna get cha high, high
Well, southernplayalisticadillacmuzik has been layed
I may wait for all aiyyo, they'll be rolling like that today hoes
So back up off get up on it if you want it cha'll
Looking for hoes and snitches was my thing on player's ball yup
So now I step, rather walk with the pimp
Lit by, my niggaz are at east point
With that college park hemp smoke style
Is how I wanna end it on this track
So I pass it to my partner
And step back up in my Cadillac
Step into my shoes, you crews sitting on truths
And those for the hoes only when we rolling through
Atlanta skies be blue, the sun is beaming it seeming
That I glistening, rather gleaming
20/20 got me leaning to the side
Feel the pride, now ain't that something?
I'm dipping into your hood
This ain't Braille but I'm bumping
Thumping out the roaches
Dungeon if ya'll missed it
Big Gimp, Goodie Mob, PA, Outkast
Southernplayalistic
It's that southernplayalisticadillacfunkymuzik
Now players if you choose it
You better make sure you don't abuse it
We gonna get cha high, high
