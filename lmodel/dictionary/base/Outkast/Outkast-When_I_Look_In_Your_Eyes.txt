(Talking) 
Hey... 
Uh huh... 
Well all right... 
How y'all doin? Yes ma'am... lookin' mighty fine... 

(Singing) 
I've been around the world, 
Seen so many pretty girls, 
But i still get overwhelmed, when I look in your eyes... 
Been from Maine to Spaine, 
But everything seems the same, 
But I only feel a change, when I look in your eyes... 
I know you're upper class, 
I know you got pussaz, 
Every man wanna kiss your... (gasp) 
and I do, too, 
Sometimes I'm just a clown, 
And everybody puts me down, 
I guess I'll come around, when I look in your eyes... 
Tell me what's a man to do? 
To get close to you? 
I'm just a lonely fool, when I look in your eyes... 
Don't tell me no this time, 
If you do, it will blow my mind, 
Have you ever seen a grown man cry? 
Its an awful thang... 
I guess its time to say good-bye, 
But I gotta give it one more try, 
I'm only satisfied, when I look in your eyes... 
Oh, Please come home with me, 
Oh, Don't you wanna marry me? 
I'm even gonna rub your feet, when they stink... (I don't care!) 
How can I let you down? 
I'm always gonna be around, 
I'm simply astound-ed, when I look in your eyes...
