[Talking] 
Hah, haha 
That's just the sound of the Hen'.. 
True Story.. Buddy Roe.. 
They say tell the truth, Shane and them (uh-huh) 
Thank God for the thugs too... 
[Chorus: Cee-Lo] 
Drop the top and let the sunshine in 
With the woodgrain, let the twinkies spin 
Get you a glass, mix the Coke and the Hen' 
It's quite alright, with the 'dro in the wind, 
with the 'dro in the wind 
[Trick Daddy] 
I'm a ol' sneaky, ol' freaky, ol' geechy-ass nigga 
Collard green, neckbone-eatin-ass nigga 
Always wearin my jeans baggy saggy 
You know Florida, Georgia, South Cakalaky 
Growed up eatin spam sandwiches 
Sugar water and mayonnaise sandwich 
Share the room with bout four mo' brothers 
But one home for 'em and wattn't no mo' covers 
A little bad motherfucker (ah-ha) 
Always rude and always in trouble 
None of my teachers ain't like me (uh-huh) 
But make it so bad, Pearl had seven mo' like me 
If you growed up the way I did 
You gotsta understand, Trick love the kids 
(Ooooooohh!) Trick love the kids 
[Chorus: Cee-Lo] 
[Trick Daddy] 
Cop me a seven-tres Chevy, put dubs on that bitch (uh-huh) 
Candy-apple green, niggaz lovin this shit (lovin this shit) 
And when I'm in it, I'll act a fool 
Ya don't like how I'm livin? Bitch fuck you (uh-huh) 
That's right I'm a rude-ass nigga 
Quick to do you, cut a fool-ass nigga 
Weighin' in at bout a buck six-five 
And a nigga can fuck, plus the boy gets live (that's right) 
You know legs, wings, and short thighs (short thighs) 
Eat 'em up, beat 'em up, then switch sides 
[Cee-Lo] 
Hot whore work her Sean John velour to the floor 
He oughta enjoy, with the loaded four-four 
Be sure and acquire more 'fore ya fuck with mine 
Disrespect; I'll disconnect ya line 
With a sick SWAT, when shit's hot, ya get shot 
The fire, the fury, ya fuck with it not 
Ya stoppin the grace, get out my space and my - face 
Fore me and my ace-a lay down the whole place 
Recognize, this is the verbalize 
Surprise, fuckin with me wrong way to wise nigga 
Hoes, clothes, shows, Vogues, golds 
Big ol' bankrolls, that's all a nigga know 
Throw yo' elbows, I'm sicker than I suppose 
Hoes unchose, cuz my jewelry froze 
You know how it goes, these young niggaz don't want it like this 
Go off and get yo' gat, to silence the chit-chat, blast! 
So pass, outlast, bout cash 
Mo' sicky, talk tricky to the trick like trash 
Lo realer, a go-rilla, flow for mo' scrilla 
Come clean, lookin mean, but you ain't no killa! 
(Oooooooooh!) (Trick love the kids!) 
[Chorus: Cee-Lo] 
[Big Boi] 
Look at what we got; the rims and all the 'dro 
The 'dro and all the smoke, my throat, it makes me choke 
Like a serial killer was squeezin on my throat box 
In the cluthces of danger but not a stranger on the block 
Is it the cheeferry reefer beat blowin my chest up? 
Beat right from the club try my best not to mess up 
A professor of this lyrical thang, I'll take the purist strain 
of this slang and inject it into your veins 
Did your heart stop man? Drop-top fame 
Aviator shades with a rear front face 
Movin through the dirty at a slow pimps pace 
Kinda like the turtle and the rabbit in the race 
To the finish line, I jump the pair of Reeboks 
So bright, so fresh, snow white but no socks 
Then I slip on some of that O with the wings 
I'm bustin straight out the path like a three piece 
of va-lac-tic, before you slack it 
You gotta prepare it and mack it, when your jack it over tragic 
not intended for any illegal purposes' 
it's like anthrax and small pox in surplus to murder us 
(Ya gotsta understand Trick love the kids!) 
(Trick love the kids!) 
[Chorus: Cee-Lo]
