<song artist="Outkast" title="Gonna_Be_Fine">
can't believe you would leave me this way. 
feelin kinda bad from the last things we said today.
can't believe you would turn and walk away.
you know we do this again and again.
(pre chorus) You say you love me, 
I come back with I hate you.
only takes me a day to,
realize I'm in love with you.
you say it's over
i come back with just stay boy
if you don't want my love, 
then i have no choice this time.
(chorus)Tell me baby, what to do.
i ain't trippin over you.
any, any other time,
remember I'm gone be fine!
how can't I make mistakes,
i dunno whats up with you.
any, any other time
remember i'm gone be fine!
said you didn't mean it, that's fine.
you wanna take it back cause you're
having a change of mind.
sometimes sayin sorry won't do
but then some days I just can't do with out you
(PRE CHORUS 3x)...
(chorus 3x)
Rap(OutKast):
Yo, yo
Across the way
The milkman delivered this
Everyday on schedule
Ain't good use to cry over spilled lactose
When you got these vegetables
The four food groups
Ain't nothing but
Four ways to keep four families paid
Oprah went from one line to
Telling y'all silly ass rock upstate
Yeah
So for one, girl
When I met you
I'ma say this
You's was fine
You traveled around the block
I let you drive the 'Lac one time
Maybe your hearts at stake
Some of the people around
You act of fate
'Cuz you can't
Cake up, wake up
Picture make up
Straight up like that
Chorus three times fading
