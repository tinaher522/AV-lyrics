<song artist="Outkast" title="Jazzybelle">
Yeah
Oh yes, I love her like Egyptian, want a description, my royal highness
So many plusses when I bust that there can't be no minus
Went from yellin' crickets and crows, bitches and hoes to queen thangs
Over the years I been up on my toes and yes I seen thangs
Like Kilroy, chill boi because them folks might think you soft
Talkin' like that, man fuck them niggaz I'm goin' off
And comin' right back, like boomerangs when you throw 'em
With these old ghetto poems, Bankhead is better for 'em
When they can let they throw 'em, down from hitchikin' and bitin' niggaz
Until the temple they call the body, now everybody got it
Had it, talked about it amongst they friends
Comin' around my crew lookin' Jazzy, wanna pretend
Like you Ms. Goodie, Four-Shoes, even Bo knew, that you got caught
Like accupuncture patients while our nation is a boat
Straight sinkin', I hate thinkin' that these the future mommas
Of our chillun, they fuckin' a different nigga every time
They get the feelin' to, I'm willin' to go the extra kilo-meter
Just to see my senorita get her pillow
On the side of my bed where no good ever stay
House and doctor was the games we used to play
But now it's real Jazzy Belle
See what if you was a playa real playa not no slouch
Havin' the very best of life lots of steak and Perignon
Smokin' an ounce of weed yeah every single day was personal FreakNik
Freakin' these hoes in Polo clothes life as you conceived it
But your conception, deception, lookin' into your watch I see
You weapon and it's depressin', they're diggin' up in your thighs
Leavin' deposits keep your closets open not your boots and drawers
Hopin' to get you sprung like bell-bottoms, steadily callin me Antwan
'Cause you thinkin' that you my lady bitch don't play me
'Cause you're chanky
I wanted to hit that ass but me and the Goodie we got danky
So thank thee, you runnin that Southerplayalistic game
You was the only one to blame, a nigga don't even know yo' name
It's a shame, you crackin' 'em you
