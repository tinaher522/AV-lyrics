<song artist="Outkast" title="Aquemini">
Even the sun goes down heroes eventually die
Horoscopes often lie and sometimes "Y"
Nothing is for sure, nothing is for certain, nothing lasts forever
But until they close the curtain
It's him and I, Aquemini
Now is the time to get on, like Spike Lee said, "Get on the bus."
Go get your work and keep your beeper chirping is a must
Is you on that dust or cornstarch familiar with that smack man
The music is like that green stuff provided to you by sack man
Pac-Man, how in the fuck you think we gon' do that man?
Riding around Old National on 18's without no gat man
I'm strapped man and already to bust on any nigga like that man
Me and my nigga we roll together like Batman and Robin
We prayed together through hard times and swung hard when it was fitting
But now we tappin' the brakes from all of them corners that we be headin' in
A Volkswagen and Bonnevilles, Chevrolets and Coupe de Villes
If you ain't got no rims nigga, don't go get wood grain steering wheel
For real you can gon' chill out and still build
Let your paper stack instead of going into overkill
Pay ya fuckin' beeper bill bitch
Even the sun goes down heroes eventually die
Horoscopes often lie and sometimes "Y"
Nothing is for sure, nothing is for certain, nothing lasts forever
But until they close the curtain
It's him and I, Aquemini
Twice upon a time there was a boy who died and
Lived happily ever after but that's anotha chapter live
From home of the brave with dirty dollas
And beauty parlors and baby bottles and bowling ball Impalas
And street scholars that majoring in culinary arts
You know how to work bread, cheese, and dough
From scratch but see the catch is you can get caught
Know what ya selling, what cha bought so cut that big talk
Let's walk to the bridge now meet me half way
Now you may see some children dead off in the pathway
It's them poor babies walkin slowly to the candy lady
It's lookin bad need some hope like the words maybe if
Or problay
More than a hobby when my turntables get wobbly they dont fall
I'm sorry y'all I often drift I'm talkin gift
So when it comes you never look the horse inside its grill
Of coarse you know I feel like a bearer of bad news
Don't want to be it but its needed so what have you
Now question is every nigga wit dreads for the cause?
Is every nigga with golds for the fall?..no
So don't get caught in appearance
Its OutKast Aquemini another black experience
Okay
Even the sun goes down heroes eventually die
Horoscopes often lie and sometimes "Y"
Nothing is for sure, nothing is for certain, nothing lasts forever
But until they close the curtain
It's him and I, Aquemini
The name is Big Boi Daddy fat sax the nigga that like them Cadillacs
I stay down with these streets 'cause these strets is where my folks at
Betta know that some say we pro-black, boy we professional
We missed a lot of church so the music is our confessional
Get off the testicles and the nut sacks
You must bust a rhyme we must bust back
Get get back for reals niggas that's out here trying to spit facts
You here dat you can't come near dat maybe you need yo quit
Because Aquemini is Aquarius and Gemini runnin' shit like this
(Yeah,. yeah, yeah)
My mind warps and bends floats the wind count to ten
Meet the twin André Ben welcome to the lion's den
Original skin, many men comprehend
I extend myself so you go out tell a friend
Sin all depends on what you believing in
Faith is what you make it, that's the hardest shit since MC Ren
Alien can blend right on in wit yo kin
Look again 'cause I swear I spot one every now and then
It's happening again wish I could tell you when
André, this is André y'all just gon have to make amends
Even the sun goes down heroes eventually die
Horoscopes often lie and sometimes "Y"
Nothing is for sure, nothing is for certain, nothing lasts forever
But until they close the curtain
It's him and I, Aquemini
