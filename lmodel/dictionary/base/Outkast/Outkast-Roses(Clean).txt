Caroline! Caroline! 
See Caroline all the guys would say she's mighty fine 
But mighty fine only got you somewhere half the time 
And the other half either got you cursed out, or coming up short 
Yeah, now dig this, even though even though
You'd need a golden calculator to divide to divide
The time it took to look inside and realize that 
Real guys go for real down to Mars girls, yeah! 
I know you'd like to thank your ... don't
But lean a little bit closer 
See roses really smell like boo-oo-ooo 
Yeah, roses really smell like boo-oo-ooo 
I know you'd like to thank your ... don't
But lean a little bit closer 
See roses really smell like boo-oo-ooo 
Yeah, roses really smell like boo-oo-ooo

Caroline! See she's the reason for the word "bitch" bitch
I hope she's speeding on the way to the club 
Trying to hurry up to get to some 
Baller or singer or somebody like that 
And try to put on her makeup in the mirror 
And crash, crash, crash.. into a bitch! 
Just Playing!
She needs a golden calculator to divide to divide 
The time it took to look inside and realize that 
Real guys go for real down to Mars girls, yeah! 
I know you'd like to thank your ... don't
But lean a little bit closer 
See roses really smell like boo-oo-ooo 
Yeah, roses really smell like boo-oo-ooo 
I know you'd like to thank your ... don't
But lean a little bit closer 
See roses really smell like boo-oo-ooo 
Yeah, roses really smell like boo-oo-ooo 
Well she's got a hottie's body, but her attitude is potty 
When I met her at a party she was hardly acting naughty 
I said "Shorty would you call me?" 
She said "Pardon me, are you ballin'?" 
I said "Darling, you sound like prostitute pausing" 
Oh so you're one them freaks, get geeked at the sight of ATM receipts 
But game been peeped, dropping names she's weak 
Trickin' off this bitch is lost 
Must take me for a geek a quick way to eat-a
A neat place sleep, a rent-a-car for a week, a trick for a treat 
Now go on the raw sex, my AIDS test is flawless 
Regardless, we don't want to get involved with no lawyers 
And judges just to hold grudges in a courtroom 
I wanna see you support bra not support you! 
I know you'd like to thank your ... don't
But lean a little bit closer 
See roses really smell like boo-oo-ooo 
Yeah, roses really smell like boo-oo-ooo 
I know you'd like to thank your ... don't
But lean a little bit closer 
See roses really smell like boo-oo-ooo 
Yeah, roses really smell like boo-oo-ooo 
I know you'd like to thank your ... don't
But lean a little bit closer 
See roses really smell like boo-oo-ooo 
Yeah, roses really smell like boo-oo-ooo 
I know you'd like to thank your ... don't
But lean a little bit closer 
See roses really smell like boo-oo-ooo 
Yeah, roses really smell like boo-oo-ooo 
Better come back down to Mars 
Girl, quit chasin' cars 
What happens when the dough get so low 
Bitch, you ain't that fine 
No way.. no way.. no way 
Better come back down to Mars 
Girl, quit chasin' cars 
What happens when the dough get so low 
Bitch, you ain't that fine 
No way.. no way.. no way 
Crazy Bitch
Bitch, stupid ass bitch
Old punk ass bitch, old dumb ass bitch
A bitch's bitch, just a bitch
Crazy Bitch
Bitch, stupid ass bitch
Old punk ass bitch, old dumb ass bitch
A bitch's bitch, just a bitch
