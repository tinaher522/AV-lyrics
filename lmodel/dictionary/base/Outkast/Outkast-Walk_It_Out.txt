Ay
Now walk it out (now walk it out)
Now walk it out (now walk it out)
Now walk it out (now walk it out)
Now walk it out
West side walk it out (West side walk it out)
South side walk it out (South side walk it out)
East side walk it out (East side walk it out)
North side walk it out (North side walk it out)
Now here we go
[Chorus]
Now walk it out (now walk it out)
Now walk it out (now walk it out)
Now walk it out (now walk it out)
Now walk it out (now walk it out)
Now West side walk it out (now West side walk it out)
Now South side walk it out (now South side walk it out)
East side walk it out (East side walk it out)
North side walk it out (North side walk it out)
Now hit the danceflo', and bend ya back low
She do it with no hands, now stop pop and roll
I'm smokin bubble ho, yeah dey in trouble ho
I like the way she move, an undercover ho
Now everybody leanin, I made the crowd rock
Now go on and walk it out, I see they on my jock
She want that bubblegum, is they the Double-mint Twins?
Two hoes choosin me, so I know that I'ma win
It's on once again, Patron once again
I threw my hair back, then I froze like the wind
West side walk it out (West side walk it out)
South side walk it out (South side walk it out)
East side walk it out (East side walk it out)
North side walk it out (North side walk it out)
[Chorus: x2]
They walk it on the East, they walk it on the West
The South side just got it, North side stuck in it
In the club, on the deuce, big stacks no flex
These suckers wanna try me tell 'em tool on deck
He walkin' in his one steady smokin' on fruits
She walked in with a friend, all in her snow boots
Oh shit there dey go (hey) they walk it on the flo'
Grey Goose, double shots, it'll let your body go
My niggas on my side, haters hate, think it's funny
I walked it on these niggas now I'm gettin to my money
Froze on them hoes, I'm not talkin 'bout dancin
Ho count 'pon the charm, diamonds steady stead' enhancin
[Chorus]
Okay now do it how you do it, go on and walk it out
I said do it how you do it, go on and walk it out
Okay, do it how you do it, go on and walk it out
I said do it how you do it, go on and walk it out
Walk, walk, walk, now walk it out
Walk, walk, walk, now walk it out
Walk, walk, walk, now walk it out
I said do it how you do it, go on and walk it out
Ay
