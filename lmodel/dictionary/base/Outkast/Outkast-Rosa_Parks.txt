Uh-huh, uh-huh, baby, yeah yeah
Uh-huh, yeah yeah, baby, uh-huh
Uh-huh, baby, uh-huh, yeah yeah
Baby, yeah yeah, uh-huh, uh-huh
Ah ha, hush dat fuss
Everybody move to tha back of the bus
Do you wanna bump and slump with us?
We the type of people make the club get crunk
Ah ha, hush dat fuss
Everybody move to tha back of the bus
Do you wanna bump and slump with us?
We the type of people make the club get crunk
Many a day has passed, the night has gone by
But still I find the time to put that bump off in your eye
Total chaos, for these playas, thought we was absent
We taking another route to represent the Dungeon Family
Like Grade A, me and and my nigga decide to take the back way
We stabbin every city when we headed to that bat cave
A-T-L, Georgia, what we do for ya
Bull doggin hoes like them Georgetown Hoyas
Boy you soundin silly, thank my Brougham aint sittin pretty
Doin doughnuts round you suckas like them circles around titties 
DAMN, we the committee , gone burn it down
But us gone bust you in the mouth with the chorus now
Ah ha, hush dat fuss
Everybody move to tha back of the bus
Do you wanna bump and slump with us?
We the type of people make the club get crunk
Ah ha, hush dat fuss
Everybody move to tha back of the bus
Do you wanna bump and slump with us?
We the type of people make the club get crunk
I met a gypsy and she hipped me to some life game
To simulate, then activate the left and right brain
Said, "Baby boy, you're only funky as your last cut
You focus on the past your ass'll be a has but.
That's one to live by or either that's one to die to
I try to just throw it at you determine your own adventure, Andr√©."
Got to her station here's my destination
She got off the bus, the conversation lingered in my head for hours
Took a shower, kinda sour cause my favorite group ain't commin' wit it
But I'm with you 'cause you probably goin' through it anyway
But anyhow when in doubt, went on out and bought it
'Cause I thought it would be jammin', but examine all the flawsky-wasky
Awfully sad and its costly but thats all shit
Broke and I hope I never have to float in that boat
Up shit's creek, it's weak is the last quote
That I want to hear when I'm goin down when all's said and done
And we got a new joe in town
When the record playa get skippin' and slowin' down
All y'all can say is them niggas earned that crown, but until then
Ah ha, hush dat fuss
Everybody move to tha back of the bus
Do you wanna bump and slump with us?
We the type of people make the club get crunk
Ah ha, hush dat fuss
Everybody move to tha back of the bus
Do you wanna bump and slump with us?
We the type of people make the club get crunk
Ah ha, hush dat fuss
Everybody move to tha back of the bus
Do you wanna bump and slump with us?
We the type of people make the club get crunk
Say ah ha, hush dat fuss
Everybody move to tha back of the bus
Do you wanna bump and slump with us?
We the type of people make the club get crunk
Uh-huh, uh-huh, baby, yeah yeah
Uh-huh, yeah yeah, baby, uh-huh
Uh-huh, baby, uh-huh, yeah yeah
Baby, yeah yeah, uh-huh, uh-huh
Uh-huh, uh-huh, baby, yeah yeah
Uh-huh, yeah yeah, baby, uh-huh
Uh-huh, baby, uh-huh, yeah yeah
Baby, yeah yeah, uh-huh, uh-huh
