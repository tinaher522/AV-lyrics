Intro:(andre 3000)
Niggas in the point ain't changed...
Niggas in the point ain't changed...
Verse 1: (andre 3000)
A nigga ready from the get go
y'all hear my shit go, it's andre, can you punk ass come out to play
stay in your little hole, then coward tuck your head
you dont know who you be fucking with yous better off...dead
is what I say, best run the other way
in case of physical breakdown...y'all can break now
my kitchen full of heat, if you can't take the temp make yourself exempt
pussy footin' around dont be getting y'all nowhere but stuck
nowhere to duck, bullets flying, niggas dying
by getting blasted, how drastic
they got the nerve to ask me why I do the things I do
I got the nerve to serve you up just like a waiter do 
but naw (naw naw), I take that back, that's my problem
turnin' and walkin' away just ain't gon' work when they be robbin'
as long as big boi's still livin', never standin' by my lonesome
step up nigga if you want some
Chorus x2: ain't no thang but a chicken wang
we havin' a smoke out in the dungeon with the mary jane
it's just the pimps, players, mack daddies, east point 
it's all about that sess in your chest, it's the joint
Verse 2: (big boi)
well nigga, you softer than silicone, used to pump up tits
it's that nigga down in the dungeon with them playeristic hits
I'm quick to stop a sucka flow like menopause
it's the original ghetto bastard, so now I make a switch
used to sell dope, but in 1994 I'm makin' southernplayalisticadillacmuzik
but see these voices in my skull has got me reminiscing
about the days back when me mammy had to work in kitchens
she had me makin' better grades to make a better life
but I never had no love or respect, 'cause we's gon' be alright
I ran the streets and broke my curfew 'cause I gave a shit
I carried guns and butcher knives 'cause I was steadily in the mix, yea
it was so hard to say goodbye, I'm a man now
I'm at the end of my street, so it time to take my stand now
I call the wild because it's time to take the streets
so if you ain't got the vertebrae or big enough nuts, retreat
I'm ready to wet 'em up like cereal 
just an international playa coming through your stereo
(chorus)
Verse 3: (andre 3000)
3-5-7 to your forehead, they'll be mo' dead, 'cause I'm a pro kid
but lord forgive me, I got to keep my milli right be near me
my nine be doin' fine until these niggas wants to clear me off my street
but in my hood hood, they hollerin' ghetto
dont got no neighbours, they hit the pipe and never let go
but I feel for them like chaka khan feel for you
ain't shit that we can do but rest in peace, pour a brew
on the concrete, remember when we ran deep
remember at the party when we served them niggas dandy
they know not to test us, test me, do me, try me
trippin' with the drama, my beretta's right beside me
one is in the air and one is in the chamber
y'all ask me what the fuck I'm doin', I'm releasing anger
quick to dodge danger, I'm taking it one day at a time
I got the fattest dimes around my way, you can sway with andre
I'll take it to the ho-jo, bitch, just to let you know
(chorus)
Verse 4: (big boi)
it's on my friend, on the road again
I'm travelin' doing more than 65 on 85 off my cadillac
I got that nigga dre, he ridin' shotgun, and got my pump under my seat
in case these youngstas wanna have some fun
I'd do it if I have to bustin' caps with this here heat heater
load in clip up after clip I'm packing my gauge, if I feel it
the glock, the gat, the nine, the heaters
see I be bustin' caps like my amp be bustin' speakers
so how do you figure that big boi be sceard to blast ya
you supposed to be quickest draw, but man, well hell, I'm faster
uh, 1-2-3, you need to think about the future
before I shoot ya ass and dilute your blood with lead
from my hollow tips, I'll send you to an early grave
you fucking slave, you better try another way, to take me out
it's truly somethin' difficult, dont even run upon me
unless you want your brain broke 
I'm out of bullets letting loose my last clip
I'm a kick you in yo' ass and yo' nigga getting pistol whipped
you know that's how I do, you know that's how I do
(chorus)
outro: (big boi)
yeah and it dont stop and it dont quit, to the muthafuckin' organized noize
PA, goodie mob, big gipp, and all the niggas around the east point way
college park is really on the map, we comin' around atlanta 
and the niggas are really strapped with the muthafuckin' guns
and the muthafuckin glocks, steady is the gas nigga
dont fear it, and it dont stop
