God...Come in God...God Come in god
Damn your a girl
Well, I guess the reason why I'm talkin to you tonight is because
I've been doin' a lot of thinking
I consider myself a pretty cool guy
and I've never cheated on any of my girlfriends
Well, except that one little time in Japan
but that was just some head
And head don't count right
Ahh thanks god. I knew you'd understand
Well, I just feel like I want to be honest with you
God, I just need a sweet bitch
You know I just need somebody not too...not too fast but not too slow
Cause I don't have it all my damn self
You know life aint easy
I just want some body by my side
to help smooth that thang out you know what I'm talkin bout
At this point ,I'm not bein picky
She doesn't even have to have a big ol' ass
Something well proportioned to her body
You know a nice lil' tail you know
Wha??
you say you, you say you found somebody?
Is she cute?
So, when do I get to meet her?
Ahh god your the greatest
well, I guess I'll talk to you later
Amen I'm sorry I'm sorry Ahlady
