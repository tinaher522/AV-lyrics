<song artist="Outkast" title="Love_Hater">
Everybody needs a glass of water today
to chase the hate away
you know you've got company comin over,
so you scrub extra hard
and everybody needs somebody to love
before its too late, its too late
(dont nobody want to grow old and lonely)
everybody needs someone to rub their shoulders
and scratch their dandruff
and everybody need to quit acting hard n shit
before you get yo ass whooped (i'll slap tha fuck out ya)
everybody needs somebody to love
before its too late, its too late
love hater 
love hater
hater of love
love hater
love hater
hater of love
love hater
love hater
hater of love
love hater
everybody needs somebody to love
everybody needs somebody to love
everybody needs somebody to love
