<song artist="Outkast" title="Behold_A_Lady">
Sophistafunk, aristocats
Distinguished dawgs, clean up your act
Pull up your pants, ladies and gents
Please, act like you got some sense
You know what I really wanna know?
Where do all the good girls go?
What clubs they hang in?
Behold,
A lady
I see you standin' on the wall
Clap, clap, you deserve it all
Behold,
(Candy-coated unicorns are)
A lady
(Quite hard to find)
I see you standin' on the wall
(The classic lady, a rare breed indeed)
Clap, clap... you deserve it all
(Is that make and model discontinued?)
Today I might snow, 
Tomorrow I'll rain
3000's always changing but you stay the same
And I need that, 
Hey I need that (in my life)
When I feel washed up and 
Inadequate and
Throw all my songs away, no matter how mad I get
You make me smile, 
You make me smile
You make me smile, 
You make me...
You're the anchor that holds me down
When my ship is sinking
You won't let me drown and I'm grateful
Behold, 
(Baby you can't disappear like the dinosaurs)
A lady
(Oh that's such a big bang there)
I see you standin' on the wall
(Maybe their still around)
Clap, clap, you deserve it all
(But only to be seen with appreciative eyes)
Behold,
(Baby don't take it for granted)
A lady
(They lost all their magic)
I see you standin' on the wall
(Oh how awful)
Clap, clap, you deserve it all
(Oh so tragic)
Yo' mama's old fashioned (fashioned), 
Yo' daddy don't play (don't play)
You'll always be this lovely 'cause they raised you that way
Hallelujah! 
Thank ya Jesus! Thank ya Lord!
Thank ya Jesus! Thank ya Lord!
Thank ya Jesus! Thank ya Lord!
You're not extra-extra, 
You're so plain Jane
The yin to my yang, darlin'
You've got that thang and you know it
But yet you (but yet you don't and that's what's so cool)
You don't say too much, 
But when you do it's profound
In the street you hold your head high
At home you get low down for me
Can't get no lower,
Can't get no lower, 
Can't get no lower, yeah!
You're the anchor that holds me down
When my ship is sinking, you won't let me drown 
(Sad, but one day our kids) 
(Will have to visit museums)
(To see what a lady looks like)
Behold,
(So if you find one, I beg you, hold her tight)
A lady
(Yes, if you spot one, good sir, treat her right)
I see you standin' on the wall
(This is Benjamin Andre signing off)
Clap, clap, you deserve it all
Thanks a million
Good luck and goodnight
Behold,(behold)
A lady (a lady)
I see you standin' on the wall (I see you standing)
Clap, clap, you deserve it all
Behold,(behold)
A lady (a lady)
I see you standin' on the wall (I see you standing)
Clap, clap, you deserve it all
Behold,(behold)
A lady...
