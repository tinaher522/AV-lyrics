<song artist="Outkast" title="Where_Are_My_Panties">
{The morning after}
{What time is it? 7:48
Where, where are my, oh boy, oh boy are my panties?
Oh my God, where are my panties? Damn where? I don't
He ain't gon' think I'm a hoe, fuck that I liked it
I was drunk and it was my birthday anyway
Maybe I should just lay here and let him touch my booty
But he don't even know my name}
{I know she think I just think she some kind of hoe
I don't give a shit about givin' it up on the first night
That just let me know she know what she want out of life
What a hell of a way to goddamn wake up
Oh that shit was good, oh maybe she'll get me some breakfast
And she so goddamn sweet, sweet as she wanna be
I just lay, I wanna lay in her hair, can't fall for her don't fall for her, ice cold
(Ice cold)
Maybe I'll just roll over and just lay on her booty, yeah, no no no
No, I'll just lay and be cool, be cool, ice cold
(Ice cold)
But what if she's the, what if she's the, what if she's, what if she's the one}
