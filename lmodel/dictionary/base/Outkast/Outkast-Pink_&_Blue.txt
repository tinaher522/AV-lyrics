<song artist="Outkast" title="Pink_&_Blue">
Pretty pink, baby blue
Why don't (why don'tcha) teach me somethin' new
We're all (we're all) just babies in my view
So crawl baby, crawl baby
(Repeat verse)
Miss lady
You coulda been born a little later but I don't care
So what if yo' head sports a couple of gray hairs
Same here and actually I think it's funky
(in a Claire Huxtible type of way)
Miss lady
It looks to me like you need a little juice in ya' life
Call me when that big ol' house gets lonelyfied
And I'll teleport from here to there
You show me how it's supposed to be done
I'll make sure you have young fun
Pretty pink, baby blue
Why don't (why don'tcha) teach me somethin' new
We're all (we're all) just babies in my view
So crawl baby, crawl baby
(Repeat verse)
You're sophisticated
Just me and miss lady
You've got me talkin' like a baby
You make me talk baby talk
Mm-hm, baby talk
She's sophisticated
You make me talk baby talk
Just me and miss lady
It makes me talk baby talk
You've got me talkin' like a baby
Like gaa gaa, and goo goo, oh mama!
You're sophisticated
You make me talk baby talk
Just me and miss lady
You're so experienced (you've got me talkin' like a baby)
Teach me somethin' new
Teach me somethin' new
You're sophisticated 
Just me and miss lady
You've got me talkin' like a baby
You're sophisticated...
