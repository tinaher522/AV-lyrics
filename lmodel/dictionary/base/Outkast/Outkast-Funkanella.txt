Clue 
clue 
clue 
clue...
[Big Boi]
Out of the basement
Out of the dungeon
Look at these broads
What have you done to them?
Rippin'it, sippin'it
Puttin' a clip in it
Trimmin' it off the women
I'm swimming
It's odd to me your words are kind of drippin'
I'm trippin'
Your flow's non-existant bitches missin'
I gave it Robert Rudolf
Or Puss in boots with his boots off
I had a new boss
Check the southern slang boy gotta troop drawn
&gt;From East point to New York
It's Outkast runnin' through y'all
Allaljuah
Oh y'all
Who can rip like this
Punchaneller, Punchaneller
I guess It's DJ Clue
Aquamini and Roc-A-fella
I got the blue box and the feathers
F**k the hatas and the hellas
Like you know it's on tonight
Cause everything got kinda reder
Who can rip like this
Punchaneller, Punchaneller
I guess It's DJ Clue
Aquamini and Roc-A-fella
I got the blue box and the feathers
F**k the hatas and the hellas
Like I fooled them into thinking
That life will all get better
[Dre]
Pissing in the waiting
Or shooting in the door
I have a blind date
Maybe f**king in the park
Without a rubber on
We are not alone
When I was young a song,
Had no f**kin' meaning, meaning
Now we a feinding for the new news, new news
Like all of these activates part of you that don't mo, move
You back are gettin' closer but you don't have a clue
Who only plays by the tens on the 1 and 2
Hook (x2)
We can do it too
Funkanella, funkanella
[Killer Mike]
A knot to remove your crew of those iceburg sweaters
Boy I've nevr seen soft punch a fella
I remain in
The company of insane men
I be the reason niggas in the jeep tuck they chains in
Keep it swingin'
Why you trippin'
Hey we brothers
I'm like why you sniffin'
I got a snort headed motherf**kers!!
Niggas up to addict
But all you high yella heffa, got you up her panties
Believe which niggas make it like D'angelo
Crying and close to dying on they grandma's flo'

If you tell us where the dope at then I promise we go
Stop crying, stop praying where the yeh at ho'
Don't you dare scream Jesus I can snuff your mouth
Money, dope, you let these D boys move out your house
We ran open, red hook, we can't use that to cook
Mykill from Averfeild with a murderous look
Leave you shook and nigga Punchenella, punchenella
I urge to Rob, rob-a-Fella, rob-a-fella
*Break {Speaking}*
Ayo rob that fellow man
And give me his god damn jewelry nigga
Hell yeah nigga
Strip down, strip buck naked for a nigga
Get that for it nigga
Strip nigga
Yeah
Black on pop nigga
{gunshots}
Man f**k that nigga
Who can rip like this
Punchaneller, Punchaneller
I guess It's DJ Clue
Aquamini and Roc-A-fella
I got the blue box and the feathers
F**k the hatas and the hellas
Like I fooled them into thinking
That life will all get better
[Slimm Calhoun]
Now Slimm ain't havin' it
DF advocate
Bustin' with Kast and Clue
Now Calhoun with a 'matic means
Shake and get tragic
Ma brother
So what you gon' do
It's the deal pushing flash pan
The big deal change
I'm working up 
Two in the back
Tocked out in the main
Keep this thing blowin' for the hellas nad the hatas
Just get off the caper for the case and the gator
Now I stacked up and sacked up in the back to the block
With eight bars to the heart
To asert it I chop
Keep on working 24 in the glock
Made the deep game, aquamini and Roc
Who can rip like this
Punchaneller, Punchaneller
I guess It's DJ Clue
Aquamini and Roc-A-fella
I got the blue box and the feathers
F**k the hatas and the hellas
Like you know it's on tonight
Cause everything got kinda reder
Who can rip like this
Punchaneller, Punchaneller
I guess It's DJ Clue
Aquamini and Roc-A-fella
I got the blue box and the feathers
F**k the hatas and the hellas
Like I fooled them into thinking
That life will all get better

Hard knock life backstage
