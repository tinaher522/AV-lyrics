<song artist="Outkast" title="In_Your_Dreams">
[Chorus Begin]
We spent summer dreaming, when we could be leaving, Woo-ooo...
I get wild and don't give a f**k, see you when the sun come up
I guess i'll get you in your dreams (woo) (woo-ooo) (woo)
I guess i'll get you in your dreams 
I get wild and don't give a f**k, see you when the sun come up
I guess i'll get you in your dreams 
[Chorus End]
The moon's around my sun, and my nights around my days 
Nocturnal creature by habit bruce wayne know what i mean
I mean i'm in between sunset and sunrise 
As its on type of nigga for the home invasion suprise-prise
Mother f**ka pow-pow [gunshot]lay the f**k down now 
Now naw, don't try to talk your way out 
because i'm usually non violent, positively vibing
but every now and then you got a nigga wanna try you, 
Why? I don't know, i don't even understand it 
but it's simply overstood how you really suppose to handle it, 
pardon me one moment i just went off on a tangent, ha ha ha ha 
[Chorus]
Typical day off in the A, aye
But nicks up the chevrolet, aye
Nigga wanna rob okay, okay
Where he stand is where he lay, aye
Keep looking at me with a gangsta grill,
I'm gonna give your ass a gangsta's pill,
That's a little piece of lead, taken to the head
That nigga ain't live, that nigga there dead
Taken dirt naps, sleeping with the fishes,
Done like dishes, this a wrap like christmas
Big Boi, you say the word i'll make these niggas dreams a nightmare
I will bust there motherf**kin head, ha ha ha ha ha ha
[Chorus]
Your ridin', killin', feelin', straight chillin',
I feel wild and don't give a f**k, see you when the sun come up 
We roastin', boastin', flowin', straight coastin'
I feel wild and don't give a f**k, see you when the sun come up 
Thats the way a...
Keep spinnin', we grillin', bendin', straight pimpin'
I feel wild and don't give a f**k, see you when the sun come up (yeah)
Now we know when, (know when), holding, (holding) showing, controlling,
I feel wild and don't give a f**k, see you when the sun come up (oh)
[Chorus]
I guess i'll get you in your dreams
I guess i'll get you in your dreams [fades]
