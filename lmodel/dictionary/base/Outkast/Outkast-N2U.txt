(Coughing) 
Too much inspiration 
Back when I was a freshman 
I learned a valuable lesson 
A hoe gonna be a hoe 
And it don't matter about you stressin 
The only thing you do 
Tap that throat and ware protection 
And only when she spit it out 
Is when you feel rejection 
Evidence and DNA drop down 
And staining her dress 
She is making a great big mess 
Would you like to get something off your chest? 
And that is no intended pun 
I'm just joshing with you Hun 
Don't we always have a blast? 
As we bust one on one (one on one) 
I, I want to get into you 
I don't want no girlfriend 
Just want to get n2u 
I, I want to get into you 
I don't want no girlfriend 
Just want to get n2u 
Now that I'm a graduate 
She still got to have it 
School days are over 
Spike the punch and you can stab it 
Jug jug more jug 
Push pull more wood 
Isotonia club waiting nicely 
Cause we go good 
Together like slat and pepper 
Kool-aid and sugar 
Mustard and mayonnaise 
Shoulda, coulda and woulda ohhhhhhh 
And that is no intended pun 
I'm just joshing with you Hun 
Don't we always have a blast? 
As we bust one on one (one on one) 
I, I want to get into you 
I don't want no girlfriend 
Just want to get n2u 
I, I want to get into you 
I don't want no girlfriend 
Just want to get n2u 
Anit talk about commitment 
Shit waiting (anit talking bout that) 
Anit talking about the wedding rings (yeah no no can't do that) 
I hope you aint a gold digging bitch 
But Chu a fine little sexy thang 
I, I want to get into you 
I don't want no girlfriend 
Just want to get n2u 
I, I want to get into you 
I don't want no girlfriend 
Just want to get n2u
