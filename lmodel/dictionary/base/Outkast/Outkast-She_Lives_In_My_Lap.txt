[laughter]
What's wrong? What are you afraid of?
The Love Below

She stays alone, never sheds a single tear
She stays in the coolest moods, clearly woman of the year
She and all her girlfriends, they go out dressed to win
She comes back to the cooler side of town
but she lives in my lap

CHORUS
She lives in my lap (x6)
Forever my fiance
She lives in my lap
Don't need no chain
She lives in my lap
I'll get the courage one day

Make me want you, make me miss you
make me wonder where you are, then forget you
Girl remind me, just who we are
We're oh so close, but yet so far

INTERLUDE - ROSARIO DAWSON
Baby why are you acting like this?
I don't care about any of them...
I care about you!
Baby I Love you!

You've got me open wide (I love you)
Just Come inside (baby)
It's yours (it's yours)
I'm yours (I'm yours)
For sure (for sure)
Play baby play...

CHORUS
INTERLUDE
