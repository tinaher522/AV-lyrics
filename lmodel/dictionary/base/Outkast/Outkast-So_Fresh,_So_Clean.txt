<song artist="Outkast" title="So_Fresh,_So_Clean">
Chorus:
Ain't nobody dope as me I'm dressed so fresh so clean
(So fresh and so clean clean)
Know you think I'm so sexy I'm dressed so fresh so clean
(So fresh and so clean clean)
Ain't nobody dope as me I'm dressed so fresh so clean
(So fresh and so clean clean)
I love when you stare at me I'm dressed so fresh so clean
(So fresh and so clean clean)
Sir Luscious got gator belts and patty melts and Monte Carlo's
And El Dorado's I'm waking up out of my slumber feeling like Rollo
So follow it's Showtime at the Apollo
Minus the Kiki Shepard what about a ho in a leopard-print
Teddy Pender-grass cooler than Freddie Jackson
Sippin a milkshake in a snowstorm
Left my throat warm in the dorm room at the AU
We blew hey too, athletes might cake you
But you must have me mistaken with them statements that you make
Cause
Chorus
Canary yellow seven-nine Seville is on display
My nigga Bongo hooked it up Omar gone dip my rims today
So a nigga can ride out to the honeycomb hideout
I'ma show you how to wild out like Jack Trippa
Let me be bambino on your snipples
YKK on yo zippa lick you like a lizard
When I'm slizzard or sober 6 million ways to fold ya
Like Noahs I get two's of you and you get pretty deep
But I'll call yo ass round 8-ish I know you'll be there for me
Cause
Chorus
Those huge baby eyes get to runnin off at they mouth
Tellin me everything that's on yo nasty mind
They say your malnutrition in need of vitamin D
And inviting me to that tingle in yo spine
I love who you are I love who ya ain't you so Anne Frank
Let's hit the attic to hide out for bout two weeks
Rick James and no chains and whips I do suck lips
Till hips jerk and double time the boy next door's a freak
Ha Ha
Chorus
(Ah we are...) the coolest motherfunkers on the planet
(Ah my my...) the sky is fallin ain't no need to panic
(Ah ooh ooh ....) I got a stick and want yo automatic
(Ah ooh ooh...) Compatible created in the attic
(repeat)
Chorus 2x
