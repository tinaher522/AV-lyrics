<song artist="Outkast" title="The_Rooster">
Hold up
Oooh, oooh, somebody done told you you wrong
[Verse 1]
OK, I started out all alone
Cause my baby mama left me
Now there's nobody at home
Beginnin to feel like Ms. Jackson done got cloned
Well it's some real shit and I'm livin it through this song
A movin vehicle took my family
As I slept out on the sofa in the Boom Boom Room
I woke up very upset!
I throw the covers back and peek out of the draperies
My daughter, my baby, my baby mama all escapin me
In the wind, she was my friend
Like Princess Di before she died
Therefore we tried and tried again
But in the end you pay attention to the pluses
But the minuses behind make it seem like you can't win
[Hook]
Throw your neck out, throw your back out [4x]
[Verse 2]
Round two, a single parent, what is Big to do?
Throw a parrty? Not hardly, I'm tryin to stay up outta that womb
Or that p-u-s-s uss! I said uss
Luther Vandross couldn't make a home out of this house that we smooshed
Smashed, pushed to the limit! Smash and turned it timid
Hell everyone was sufferin, the house was feelin wicked
The cat got sold, the dog got old, the food got cold
Both of our tempers were on swolle
For the most part you fuss, fight, fart
You build it up to break it down and now take it from the start
Repeatedly leadin a path that only ends in a clash
Of two stubborn minds, grown folks blind to the sign
[Hook]
Throw your neck out, throw your back out [4x]
[Verse 3]
K-O, knocked out by technicality
The love has kissed the canvas
Now the whole family is mad at me
My daughter don't want me at her PTA meetins
And then my son he can't talk, when I change him he's peein
I think he's pissed
I can't dismiss the matter of the fact because he saw you and me argue
Now the energy is comin back
Set an example, a positive pattern, keep life on track
But I'm married to the music and committed to the wax
Tapes, CDs
Baby please, you make me wanna scream
You're on my team startin first string so why are we arguin?
Tapes, CDs
Baby please, you make me wanna scream
You're on my team startin first string so why are we arguin?
Throw your fuckin neck out
[Hook]
Throw your neck out, throw your back out [4x]
Tapes, CDs
Baby please, you make me wanna scream
You're on my team startin first string so why are we arguin?
Tapes, CDs
Baby please, you make me wanna scream
You're on my team startin first strin so why are we arguin?
[Hook]
Throw your neck out, throw your back out [4x] (to fade)
