[Sleepy Brown]
Outkast, Snoop Dogg, Sleepy Brown
[Chorus]
Ching-a-Ling, the ride is on me, cuz
Ching-a-Ling, we're so fresh so clean
Ching-a-Ling, we always make a seen, cuz we'ere
Ching-a-Ling, so fresh so clean
Ching-a-Ling, I been doin things now
Ching-a-Ling, so fresh so clean
Ching-a-Ling, the light stays green now
Ching-a-Ling, so fresh so clean
[Sleepy Brown]
Here I am, you know it's me
The focused-out brotha with the pinky ring
People stare, women scream
Cuz they never seen a brotha be so clean
Gangstah hats, minks to match
Glass half full just sippin now
Big Snoop Dogg bout to fuck you up
Me and Outkast just lay in the back
In the Cadillac, grill intact
Purple-blue gators, and belts to match
[Andre 3000] (Sleepy Brown)
Some people play crazy, some people play like they sane
It doesnt matter (play in the rain) we always play in the rain
Too much of data can make the mind overload
Scramble all logic not even you can decode
(Where are we going, can we slip and we slide?)
It doesnt matter just shut the fuck up and ride
I am, a multi-pimp, so fresh so clean
Rimp rimp rimp
In a .. (Cadillac, grillin tag)
(Purple-blue gators, and belts to match)
[Chorus]
[Snoop Dogg] (Sleepy Brown)
I woke up early on my birthday, pimpin in the worst way
Never come in last place, usually come in first place
First they chase me, lace me, and taste me
Kick me some brandi, keg me and lace me
Face me, look at me, now tell me what you lookin at
A P-I-M-P, and wing-tip Stacey's
Lately, hate me, is all that they could triple with
Know them niggas best to hit, that I'm the ones to kick it with
Runnin high, tell a lie, watch the P I stay outside
O-U-T-hills now, dirty see I still slide
The bitches love the way we ride
So if you aint a big dogg, then I suggest you stay in cells now
I be, G S-N-double-O-P, E-S L-B-C you feel me
You cant sell me, tell me silly gilly hilly billy
??, While I slide in the 6-9
(Cadillac, grillin tag)
(Purple-blue gators, and belts to match)
[Big Boi] (Sleepy Brown)
To the window's to the wall's, to the bathroom nigga dont fall
The cast gone keep on bumpin and dumpin, to post up on all of y'all
Got my nigga Snoop Dogg, L-B-C
College Park, E-P-T, on the remix tip we gon' sit
On the rim tip and wing tip, like a boss pimp, not a lost pimp
Cuz I, (So fresh so clean), wearin hard shoes, or not at all I
(Live, walk with a lean), take godzilla and the gator from lake placid
Manifacturing in a fashion, mashin might be stabbin
You crabbin, your girl is stabbin and frabbin I'm snappin and trappin
Deba, depana, dashin, all I need is a congac, and a cold coca-cola
Slashin, smooth serious smashin, multi-rubels matching
Toot that bootie, I'ma toot the horn, I'm a player
Every time they ask me am I (Cadillac, grillin tag)
(Purple-blue gators, and belts to match)
Two times, (Cadillac, grillin tag)
(Purple-blue gators, and belts to match)
[Chorus]
