<song artist="Outkast" title="So_Fresh_And_Clean">
Ain't nobody dope as me, I'm just so fresh, so clean
(So fresh and so clean, clean)
Don't you think I'm so sexy? I'm just so fresh, so clean
(So fresh and so clean, clean)
Ain't nobody dope as me, I'm just so fresh, so clean
(So fresh and so clean, clean)
I love when you stare at me, I'm just so fresh, so clean
(So fresh and so clean, clean)
Sir Luscious gots gator belts and patty melts
And Monte Carlo's and El Dorados
I'm waking up out of my slumber feeling like Rollo
So follow, it's Showtime at the Apollo
Minus the Kiki Shepards
What about a ho in a leopard-print?
Teddy Pender-grass cooler than Freddie Jackson
Sipping a milkshake in a snowstorm
Left her throat warm in the dorm room at the A.U.
We blew hay too, athletes might cake you
But you must have me mistaken with them statements
That you make 'cause
Ain't nobody dope as me, I'm just so fresh, so clean
(So fresh and so clean, clean)
Don't you think I'm so sexy? I'm just so fresh, so clean
(So fresh and so clean, clean)
Ain't nobody dope as me, I'm just so fresh, so clean
(So fresh and so clean, clean)
I love when you stare at me, I'm just so fresh, so clean
(So fresh and so clean, clean)
Canary yellow, seven-nine, Seville is on display
My nigga, Bongo hooked it up, Omar gon' dip my rims today
So a nigga can ride out to the Honeycomb Hideout
I'ma show you how to wild out like Jack Tripper
Let me be bambino on your snipples, YKK on yo' zipper
Lick you like a lizard when I'm slizzard or sober
Six million ways to fold ya like Noah's
I get two's of youse and you get pretty 'D'
But I'll call yo' ass round eightish
I know you'll be there for me girl
Ain't nobody dope as me, I'm just so fresh, so clean
(So fresh and so clean, clean)
Don't you think I'm so sexy? I'm just so fresh, so clean
(So fresh and so clean, clean)
Ain't nobody dope as me, I'm just so fresh, so clean
(So fresh and so clean, clean)
I love when you stare at me, I'm just so fresh, so clean
(So fresh and so clean, clean)
Those huge baby eyes, get to running off at they mouth
And telling me everything that's on yo' nasty mind
They say you're malnutritioned in need of vitamin D
And inviting me to that tingle in your spine
I love who you are, love who you ain't, you're so Anne Frank
Let's hit the attic to hide out for 'bout two weeks
Rick James, 'n no chains and whips, I do suck lips 'til hips jerk
In double time the boy next do's a freak, ha ha
Ain't nobody dope as me, I'm just so fresh, so clean
(So fresh and so clean, clean)
Don't you think I'm so sexy? I'm just so fresh, so clean
(So fresh and so clean, clean)
Ain't nobody dope as me, I'm just so fresh, so clean
(So fresh and so clean, clean)
I love when you stare at me, I'm just so fresh, so clean
(So fresh and so clean, clean)
And we are the coolest motherfunkers on the planet
And my, my, the sky is falling, ain't no need to panic
But ooh, ooh, I got a stick and want yo' automatic
Ooh, ooh, ooh, compatible created in the attic
And we are the coolest motherfunkers on the planet
And my, my, the sky is falling, ain't no need to panic
But ooh, ooh, I got a stick and want yo' automatic
Ooh, ooh, ooh, compatible created in the attic
Ain't nobody dope as me, I'm just so fresh, so clean
(So fresh and so clean, clean)
Don't you think I'm so sexy? I'm just so fresh, so clean
(So fresh and so clean, clean)
Ain't nobody dope as me, I'm just so fresh, so clean
(So fresh and so clean, clean)
I love when you stare at me, I'm just so fresh, so clean
(So fresh and so clean, clean)
Ain't nobody dope as me, I'm just so fresh, so clean
(So fresh and so clean, clean)
Don't you think I'm so sexy? I'm just so fresh, so clean
(So fresh and so clean, clean)
Ain't nobody dope as me, I'm just so fresh, so clean
(So fresh and so clean, clean)
I love when you stare at me, I'm just so fresh, so clean
(So fresh and so clean, clean)
Ain't nobody dope as me, I'm just so fresh, so clean
(So fresh and so clean, clean)
Don't you think I'm so sexy? I'm just so fresh, so clean
(So fresh and so clean, clean)
Ain't nobody dope as me, I'm just so fresh, so clean
(So fresh and so clean, clean)
I love when you stare at me, I'm just so fresh, so clean
(So fresh and so clean, clean)
