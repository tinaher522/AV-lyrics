<song artist="Outkast" title="The_Way_U_Move">
Boom, boom, boom
Ready for action, nip it in the butt
We never relaxin', OutKast is everlastin'
Not clashin', not at all
But see my nigga went to do a little acting
Now that's for anyone askin' give me one pass 'em
Drip, drip, drop, there goes an eargasm
Now you cumin out the side of your face
We tapping right into your memory banks
(Thanks)
So flickle the tickle, let's see your seat belt fastened
Trunk rattlin' like two midgets in the back seat wrasling
Speakerbox vibrate the tank
Make it sound like aluminum cans in the back
But I know ya'll wanted that 808
Can you feel that B A S S, bass
But I know ya'll wanted that 808
Can you feel that B A S S, bass
I like the way you move
I like the way you move
I love the way you move
I love the way, I love the way
I love the way you move
I love the way you move
I love the way you move
I love the way, I love the way
Then the whole room fell silent
The girls all pause with glee, turning left turning right
Hardly looking at me
But I was looking at them, there, there on the dance floor
Now they got me in the middle feeling like a man whore
Specially the big girl
Big girls need love too no discrimination in this world
So keep your hands off my cheeks
And let me study how you ride the beat
You big freak
Skinny, slim women got the ghetto within them
You can hump them, lift them, bend them
Give them something to remember
Hail out timber when you fall through the chop shop
Take a deep a breath and exhale your ex male friend
Boyfriend was boring as hell
Now let me listen to the stories you tell
And we can make moves like a person in jail
On the loco
I like the way you move
I like the way you move
I love the way you move
I love the way, I love the way
I love the way you move
I love the way you move
I love the way you move
I love the way, I love the way
Hey baby, girl, don't you stop
Come on baby, dance on the top of me
You so fine, you so fine
(You so fine)
You drive me outta my mind, baby
(My mind, outta my mind)
If I could I would just be with you, baby
'Cause you like me and excite me
And you know you gotta leave, baby
I like the way you move
(I like the way you move)
I like the way you move
(You so sexy, baby)
I love the way you move
I love the way, I love the way
I love the way you move
(I love the way you move)
I love the way you move
(You so sexy, baby)
I love the way you move
I love the way, I love the way
I like the way you move
I like the way you move
I love the way you move
I love the way, I love the way
I love the way you move
I love the way you move
I love the way you move
I love the way, I love the way
