<song artist="Rita_Ora" title="Hello,_Hi,_Goodbye">
Hello, hi goodbye
So I'm sayin'
Hello, hi goodbye
Sayin'
Hello, hi, goodbye
Sayin'
Hello, hi, goodbye
Sayin'
Imagine a future of you and me 
Seems good and then you leave
The pain in this vision is killing me
Reality is we will never be
I'm prone to a love travesty 
And this feels like another tragedy and the truth really is
We're too young to understand love demands 
Love express will take you up with the fireflies 
And let's you go then crash
No replying from the ash
We'll just be burning up after that
I'll hate you or
You'll hate me or
I'll take you or
You'll break me or
And now I'm scared 'cause I've been there
Stuck in this prison, no optimism
And now it's hello, hi goodbye
My heart has no room for love
So I'm sayin' hello, hi goodbye
My heart fell, no gettin' up
Sayin' hello, hi, goodbye
Any other time I'd be yours 
Sayin' hello, hi, goodbye
But that thing in me is gone
I know you wish somehow I could explain
I'm still numb from the pain
And I don't wanna know your name
Please get up and walk away
I don't wanna fall in love again
Don't wanna start anything that could end 
I know you think you can get through to me
But I'm on lock in love's penitentiary
I already know how this goes 
Lay down, broken heart, broke 
I'll hate you or
You'll hate me or
I'll take you or
You'll break me or
And now I'm scared 'cause I've been there
Stuck in this prison, no optimism
And now it's hello, hi goodbye
My heart has no room for love
So I'm sayin' hello, hi goodbye
My heart fell, no gettin' up
Sayin' hello, hi, goodbye
Any other time I'd be yours 
Sayin' hello, hi, goodbye
But that thing in me is gone
It's gone, it's gone
It's gone, it's gone
It's gone, it's gone
It's gone, it's gone
It's gone, it's gone
It's gone, it's gone
It's gone, it's gone
It's gone, it's gone
It's gone, it's gone
It's gone, it's gone
It's gone, it's gone
It's gone, it's gone
