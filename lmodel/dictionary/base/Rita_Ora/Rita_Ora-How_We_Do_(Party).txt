<song artist="Rita_Ora" title="How_We_Do_(Party)">
And party and bullshit
And party and bullshit
And party and bullshit
And party, and party...
I stumble up to the window
Open the curtains to blinding light
Make up all over the pillow
What went on? What went on?
What went on last night?
You look so sweet while you’re dreaming
Holding your bottle of tanqueray
It isn't even the weekend
Maybe that's how I know you’re the one for me
I wanna party and bullshit
And party and bullshit (with you)
And party and bullshit
And party and bullshit
And party, and party
'Cause when the sun sets baby
On the avenue
I get that drunk sex feeling
Yeah, when I’m with you
So put your arms around me baby,
We’re tearing up the town
'Cause that’s just how we do
We got that sweetheart loving
Dancing in the dark
Out in the streets we're running,
Shut down every bar
So put your arms around me baby
We’re tearing up the town
'Cause that’s just how we do
How we do-oooo
That's just how we do
How we do-oooo
That’s just how we do
Hungover, I think I’m broken
You said a fix is a shot of jack
I said man what are you smoking?
But alright, pour a glass and we'll throw 'em back
I wanna party and bullshit
And party and bullshit
And party and bullshit
And party and bullshit
And party, and party
'Cause when the sun sets baby
On the avenue
I get that drunk sex feeling
Yeah, when I’m with you
So put your arms around me baby,
We’re tearing up the town
'Cause that’s just how we do
We got that sweetheart loving
Dancing in the dark
Out in the streets we're running,
Shut down every bar
So put your arms around me baby
We’re tearing up the town
'Cause that’s just how we do
How we do-oooo
That’s just how we do
How we do-oooo
That’s just how we do
How we do-oooo (and party and bullshit)
That’s just how we do (and party and bullshit)
How we do-oooo (and party and bullshit)
That’s just how we do (and party and party)
And party and bullshit
And party and bullshit
And party and bullshit
And party, and party
I wanna party and bullshit
And party and bullshit
And party and bullshit
And party and bullshit
And party, and party.
'Cause when the sun sets baby
On the avenue
I get that drunk sex feeling
Yeah, when I’m with you
So put your arms around me baby,
We’re tearing up the town
'Cause that’s just how we do
We got that sweetheart loving
Dancing in the dark
Out in the streets we're running,
Shut down every bar
So put your arms around me baby
We’re tearing up the town
'Cause that’s just how we do
How we do-oooo (and party and bullshit)
That’s just how we do (and party and bullshit)
How we do-oooo (and party and bullshit)
That’s just how we do (and party and party)
How we do-oooo (and party and bullshit)
That’s just how we do (and party and bullshit)
How we do-oooo (and party and bullshit)
That’s just how we do (and party and party)
And party and bullshit
And party and bullshit
And party and bullshit
And party, and party
