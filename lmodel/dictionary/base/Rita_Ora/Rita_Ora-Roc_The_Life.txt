<song artist="Rita_Ora" title="Roc_The_Life">
My way in London, Americana
The persona is Primadonna
Kick a motherfucker to the ki-zerb
You think you crazy, I'm berserk
I'm off the chain, you gotta love it
I can't express enough, how bad I want it
Baby one day, I wanna be there
Be on the stars, like a zillionaire
I got my clique up in here, put them diamonds in the air
You can hate this all you want but we gone take this everywhere
Don't pay them, no never mind, you just a waste of time
Baby watch it from the sideline
While I rock the li, li, li, la, la, li, li, li, li, li, li, la, la, li, li
While I rock the li, li, li, la, la, li, li, li, li, li, li, la, la, li, li
While I rock the life
See the light, I see the money
Super glamorous, fresh off the runway
Wanna be infamous, notorious
As directed, according to us
Whiskey nights, getting it in
Blowing money fast, get it again
Baby, one day I'll live there
Be on the stars, like a zillionaire
I got my clique up in here, put them diamonds in the air
You can hate this all you want but we gone take this everywhere
Don't pay them, no never mind, you just a waste of time
Baby watch it from the sideline
While I rock the li, li, li, la, la, li, li, li, li, li, li, la, la, li, li
While I rock the li, li, li, la, la, li, li, li, li, li, li, la, la, li, li
While I rock the li, li, li, la, la, li, li, li, li, li, li, la, la, li, li
While I rock the li, li, li, la, la, li, li, li, li, li, li, la, la, li, li
While I rock the
Oh, we gone make this day last forever
Oh, I'mma make this a lot to remember, no surrender, no
Write my name on the stars, so you can see it wherever you are
Please believe it, I'mma take it all
Ain't gone stop until I fall, fall, fall, fall, fall, fall
Write my name on the stars, so you can see it wherever you are
Please believe it, I'mma take it all
Ain't gone stop until I fall, fall, fall, fall, fall
Rock the li, li, li, la, la, li, li, li, li, li, li, la, la, li, li
While I rock the li, li, li, la, la, li, li, li, li, li, li, la, la, li, li
While I rock the li, li, li, la, la, li, li, li, li, li, li, la, la, li, li
While I rock the li, li, li, la, la, li, li, li, li, li, li, la, la, li, li
While I rock the life
