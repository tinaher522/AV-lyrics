<song artist="Rita_Ora" title="Fall_In_Love">
I fall in love, I fall in love, I fall in love, I fall in love
Hey (fall in love)
I wanna play (fall in love) with you (fall in love)
Let's run away (fall in love)
Let's pick a rendezvous where we can both lay
Baby let's escalate
Boy you can be my sunshine
So fine, divine, in every way
But don't let go me, hold me, closer, closer all night every day
You make me feel feel alright, boy you my delight
So don't away
Don't want no one night stand I wanna fall in love
Fa la la la fall in love
Baby you could be my man and we can fall in love
Fa la la la fall in love
Don't want no one night stand let's fall in love
Fa la la la fall...in love
Baby, baby, you lighted my life
Like candles in the night
I can't get enough of your love
Let's do this every night
All night, all night, every day, every day
All the time, I hope the love stays
Uh-huh, uh-huh, you bring me joy
Let's now let the love intake
Don't want no one night stand I wanna fall in love
Fa la la la fall in love
Baby you could be my man and we can fall in love
Fa la la la fall in love
Don't want no one night stand let's fall in love
Fa la la la fall...in love
Fall in love, fall in love, fall in love, fall in love
I'm falling in love
I'm falling in love
I'm falling in love
I'm falling in love
I'm falling, falling in love
I'm falling in love, can you catch me
I'm falling, I'm falling, I'm falling, in love
I'm falling in love
Don't want no one night stand I wanna fall in love
Fa la la la fall in love
Baby you could be my man and we can fall in love
Fa la la la fall in love
Don't want no one night stand let's fall in love
Fa la la la fall...in love
