<song artist="Rita_Ora" title="Radioactive">
Palms to the sky, we unite
I feel it, I feel it, feel feel it
We rise tonight
I'm checking you out in your sweet desire
I'm coming over to make you my guy
It's a crime, boy, you're so fine
I'm taking you out, boy, it's agreed tonight
I'm glad you came over, it was about time
It feels right, boy, you're so fine
This goes radioactive
Drop the ball, let me feel the beat
This goes radioactive
Drop the ball, let me feel the beat
Palms to the sky
You know, I feel it
I feel it, feel, feel it
We rise tonight
Palms to the sky
We unite, I feel it
I feel it, feel, feel it
We rise tonight
Moving on me as the world ends
This nuclear heat is a beautiful air
You might live to tell
This goes radioactive
Drop the ball, let me feel the beat
This goes radioactive
Drop the ball, let me feel the beat
Palms to the sky
You know, I feel it
I feel it, feel, feel it
We rise tonight
Palms to the sky
We unite, I feel it
I feel it, feel, feel it
We rise tonight
Palms to the sky
You and I
Palms to the sky
You and I
Palms to the sky
You and I
We rise tonight
Palms to the sky
You know, I feel it
I feel it, feel, feel it
We rise tonight
Palms to the sky
We unite, I feel it
I feel it, feel, feel it
We rise tonight
We unite
You and I
Are right tonight
