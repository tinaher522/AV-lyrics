<song artist="Rita_Ora" title="I_Will_Never_Let_You_Down">
Tell me baby what we're gonna do
I'll make it easy, got a lot to lose
Watch the sunlight coming through
Open the window, let it shine on you
'Cause I've been sick and working all week
And I've been doing just fine
You've been tired of watching me
Forgot to have a good time, boy
You can take it, all these faces
Never keeping it real
I know exactly how you feel
When you say you've had enough
And you might just give it up
Oh, oh, I will never let you down
When you're feeling low on love
I'll be what you dreaming of
Oh, oh, I will never let you down
Oh, oh, I will never let you down
Oh, oh, I will never let you down
There's a million ways to go
Don't be embarrassed if you lose control
On the rooftop, now you know
Your body's frozen and you lost your soul
'Cause I've been sick and working all week
And I've been doing just fine
You've been tired of watching me
Forgot to have a good time, boy
You can take it, all these faces
Never keeping it real
I know exactly how you feel
When you say you've had enough
And you might just give it up
Oh, oh, I will never let you down
When you're feeling low on love
I'll be what you dreaming of
Oh, oh, I will never let you down
Oh, oh, I will never let you down
Oh, oh, I will never let you down
Let me take you where you never go
Have a little fun, it's the only way we know
Let me show you what you never see
You know how to love only when you holding me
When you say you've had enough
And you might just give it up
Oh, oh, I will never let you down
When you're feeling low on love
I'll be what you dreaming of
Oh, oh, I will never let you down
When you say you've had enough
And you might just give it up
Oh, oh, I will never let you down
When you're feeling low on love
I'll be what you're dreaming of
I will never let you down
