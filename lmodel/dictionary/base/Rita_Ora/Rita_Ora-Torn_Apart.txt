<song artist="Rita_Ora" title="Torn_Apart">
I heard him speak but then a saw his face
I knew we was the one because I dreamt this day
I was such a beginner on this thing called love
And now he's going away and now I'm torn apart, so torn apart
You're one of them, you see me sway
You pullin' triggers let you slide another day
Say goodbye to the one got away
Her lips for the very first thing that I saw
She threw like an angel and that made want her more
My reputation says I'm there from now
And now she's going away and now I'm so torn apart, so torn apart
You're one of them, you see me sway
You pullin' triggers let you slide another day
Say goodbye to the one got away
Never let you get away
Shouldn't have let you got away
Get away, got away
Gotta find another way
Never let 'em get away
Gotta find a way to stay
Never let 'em get away
Never let 'em get away
You never let her go
You never let her go
Feel sorry
You see me?
You hear me?
You're one of them, you see me sway
You pullin' triggers let you slide another day
Say goodbye to the one got away
