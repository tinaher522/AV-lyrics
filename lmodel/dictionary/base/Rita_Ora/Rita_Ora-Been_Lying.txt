<song artist="Rita_Ora" title="Been_Lying">
Don't wear my shades to be cool
I wear to hide my tears from you
Behind the smoke I'm so red eye
And I'm tired of you asking why
I said I've been lying to you
And I've been lying to me too
My heart has been through hell and back
I've only dressed in pretty and black
Middle finger when it comes to love
Act like I don't really give a fuck
Cause I've been lying to you
I said I've been lying to me too
I've been lying, lying to you
Baby I've been lying, lying to me, too
I've been lying, lying to you
Baby I've been lying, lying to me, too
I don't always say what I want to say
I tattoo myself to show my pain
Don't lead in a crowded space
Even though we're both face to face
Cause I've been lying to you
Said I've been lying to me too
Hurry up and wake for the spotlight
Looks like an another whisky night
What's inside they never expose
They only see what the camera shows
Cause I've been lying to you
Said I've been lying to me too, nooo
I've been lying, lying to you
Baby I've been lying, lying to me, too
I've been lying, lying to you
Baby I've been lying, lying to me, too
It's like the whole world's getting at me
Tryin to make everyone happy, that ain't me
Walking around, wearing a smile
But deep down I'm really fucked up, this ain't me
I don't wanna quit, tryin to hang with this
And figure it out who the hell I am
I don't mean to make you run away
But I don't wanna forget to be me
The truth is I don't wanna lose you
But I don't wanna lose me too
I've been lying, lying to you
Baby I've been lying, lying to me, too
I've been lying, lying to you
Baby I've been lying, lying to me, too
I've been lying, lying to you
Baby I've been lying, lying to me, too
I've been lying, lying to you
Baby I've been lying, lying to me, too
