<song artist="Rita_Ora" title="Meet_Ya">
Oh,
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Did you know that they tore down
Where I lived, yea, my mom's house
Couple summers ago
Making love
All the way till the sun down
I remember you were the king and I was the queen
And I know that it's done now
Next year it can run out
Might as well because we're young now
Do you remember
Roll around in the leaves then (oh)
Kiss until it was freezin' (oh)
Summer came and we're leavin' (oh)
Yea babe
I wanna meet ya
Meet ya, meet ya there
This time I'll stay
Cause baby, baby I need ya
Need ya, need ya there
Won't be the same
Think I'm in love
And I could be wrong
But I'm here right now
Isn't that enough?
And I know that I see you
See ya, see ya 'round
But I need ya
Need to meet ya right now
Oh,
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Now I'm on tour now
You were and it sold out
After the summer 'lone
On the bus on the way to the next town
Anybody ever wish they would run
Into the one they love
That's how I want it to turn out
Make it happen babe
Come down
Might as well because we're young now
Do you remember
Roll around in the leaves then (oh)
Kiss until it was freezin' (oh)
Summer came and we're leavin' (oh)
Yea babe
I wanna meet ya
Meet ya, meet ya there
This time I'll stay
Cause baby, baby I need ya
Need ya, need ya there
Won't be the same
Think I'm in love
And I could be wrong
But I'm here right now
Isn't that enough?
And I know that I see you
See ya, see ya 'round
But I need ya
Need to meet ya right now
Oh,
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
