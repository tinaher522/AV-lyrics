<song artist="Rita_Ora" title="Facemelt_(Intro)">
Unbuckle seat belt
Same to the waist belt
You say I'm sick
I need a fix, I need a DayQuil
Hotter than a fever
Can't stay still
I don't need an E-Pill, just need a refill
I'm the kind of heat that will make the make the place melt
Got the Nebula
For your spaceship
Last time in it, in it, in it, make the place melt
Feeling like it's burning up, now you know how they felt
I know what you came for
But please please be careful
My little daredevils
We might as well jump
This the kind of beat that will make ya make ya face melt
Make ya face melt
Make ya make ya face melt
This the kind of beat that will make ya make ya face melt
