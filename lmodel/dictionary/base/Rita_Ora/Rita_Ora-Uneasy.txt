<song artist="Rita_Ora" title="Uneasy">
Why do I keep falling, keep installing bullshit in my mind
When waterproof mascara is the key to stop those tell tell signs
My make up is my armour for the dramas that I always fight
Attire is inspired is the other statements of my life
I just can't free my mind
It's making me uneasy
I just can't free my mind
It's making me uneasy
I just can't free my mind
It's making me uneasy
Oh oh oh, yea, yea, yea, yea
In the know it's crazy whenever I get myself in that zone
But I know you gotta remember London let's just put them on
This, and if it gets easy, then I feel so uneasy
But I know you'll never forget the fact is that I walk alone
I just can't free my mind
It's making me uneasy
I just can't free my mind
It's making me uneasy
I just can't free my mind
It's making me uneasy
Oh oh oh, yea, yea, yea, yea
I feel a rush on me
Come get this cuffs off me
Come get me out of my head
And I'm stuck in sight on what I see
These bulls are blinding me
Makes me crazy, I'm feeling uneasy
I just can't free my mind
It's making me uneasy
I just can't free my mind
It's making me uneasy
I just can't free my mind
It's making me uneasy
Oh oh oh
I just can't free my mind
It's making me uneasy
I just can't free my mind
It's making me uneasy
I just can't free my mind
It's making me uneasy
Oh oh oh, yea, yea, yea, yea
