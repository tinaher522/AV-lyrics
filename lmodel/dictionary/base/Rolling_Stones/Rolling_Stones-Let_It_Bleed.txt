<song artist="Rolling_Stones" title="Let_It_Bleed">
Well, we all need someone we can lean on
And if you want it, you can lean on me
Yeah, we all need someone we can lean on
And if you want it, you can lean on me
She said, "My breasts, they will always be open
Baby, you can rest your weary head right on me
And there will always be a space in my parking lot
When you need a little coke and sympathy"
Yeah, we all need someone we can dream on
And if you want it, baby, well you can dream on me
Yeah, we all need someone we can cream on
And if you want to, well you can cream on me
I was dreaming of a steel guitar engagement
When you drunk my health in scented jasmine tea
But you knifed me in my dirty, filthy basement
With that jaded, faded, junky nurse, oh, what pleasant company
We all need someone we can feed on
Yeah, and if you want it, well you can feed on me, hey
Take my arm, take my leg
Oh, baby, don't you take my head
Yeah, we all need someone we can bleed on
Yeah, and if you want it, baby, well, you can bleed on me
Yeah, we all need someone we can bleed on
Yeah, yeah, and if you want it, baby, why don'cha bleed on me?
All over, woo
Yeah
Ah, get it on, rider, hoo, get it on rider
Get it on, rider, you can bleed all over me
Get it on, rider, woo, get it on, rider, hey
You can be my rider, you can cum all over me
Get it on, rider, babe, get it on rider
Get it on, rider, you can cum all over me, yeah
Yeah, come on
Get it on, rider, lover, you can cum all over me
