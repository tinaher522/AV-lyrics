<song artist="Rolling_Stones" title="Champagne_&_Reefer">
Bring me champagne when I'm thirsty
Bring me a reefer when I wanna get high
Give me champagne when I'm thirsty
Give me a reefer when I wanna get high
Give me a woman when I get lonely
And set her right down here by my side
Wait your turn
Well you know there shouldn't be no law
When a man want to smoke a little dope
Hey Mick, Lord there shouldn't be no law
While a man want to smoke a little dope
Yeah, it's jammin' learnin'
It's time now, don't you know
Play your song now
Everytime I get high
Yeah, I lay my head down on my baby's breast, yeah
Everytime I get high
I wanna lay my head down on my baby's breast
Well, you know she hug and kiss me, baby
She says, "Buddy Guy you are the best."
I'm wanna get high this morning
People, sure as you know my name
I'm gonna get high this morning, Mick
Just as sure is my name
You can bet my bottom dollar
Keith don't use no cocaine
Give me champagne when I'm thirsty
Give me a reefer when I wanna get high
Give me champagne when I'm thirsty
Give me a reefer when I wanna get high
Give me a woman when I get lonely
Lay down by my baby's side
Let's play the blues, we got two more choruses
One more time, one more time, one more time
Yessir
Give me a woman when I get lonely
Lay her down by my baby's side
Thank you
Buddy Guy
Budy, Motherfucker, Guy
