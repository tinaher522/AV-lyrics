<song artist="Rolling_Stones" title="Out_Of_Tears">
I can't feel, feel a thing 
I can't shout, I can't scream 
Breathe it out, breathe it in 
All this love from within 
I won't cry when you say goodbye 
I'm out of tears 
I won't die when you wave goodbye 
I'm out of tears, out of tears 
I won't drink, I won't eat 
I can't hear, I won't speak 
Let it out, let it in 
All this pain from within
And I just can't pour my heart out to another living thing
I'm a whisper, I'm a shadow 
But I'm standing up to sing
I won't cry when you say goodbye 
I'm out of tears (out of tears)
I won't die when you wave goodbye 
I'm out of tears, yes I am
I won't cry, I swear my eyes are dry 
I'm out of tears, yeah (out of tears)
I won't cry, I'm going to tell you why 
I'm out of tears, out of tears, out of tears 
Let it out from within 
Some you lose, some you win 
I can drift, I can dream 
Till I float off your screen
And I just can't pour my heart out to another living thing 
I'm a whisper, I'm a shadow 
But I'm standing up to sing 
I won't cry when you say goodbye 
I'm out of tears (out of tears)
I won't die when you wave goodbye 
I'm out of tears, out of tears
I won't cry, I swear my eyes are dry 
I'm out of tears (out of tears)
I won't cry, I'm going to tell you why 
I'm out of tears, out of tears, out of tears
