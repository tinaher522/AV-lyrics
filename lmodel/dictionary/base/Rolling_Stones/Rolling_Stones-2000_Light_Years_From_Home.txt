<song artist="Rolling_Stones" title="2000_Light_Years_From_Home">
Sun turnin' 'round with graceful motion
We're setting off with soft explosion
Bound for a star with fiery oceans
It's so very lonely
You're a hundred light years from home
Freezing red deserts turn to dark
Energy here in every part
It's so very lonely
You're six hundred light years from home
It's so very lonely
You're a thousand light years from home
It's so very lonely
You're a thousand light years from home
Bell flight fourteen you now can land
See you on Aldebaran, safe on the green desert sand
It's so very lonely
You're two thousand light years from home
It's so very lonely
You're two thousand light years from home
