<song artist="Rolling_Stones" title="Mixed_Emotions">
Button your lip, baby
Button your coat
Let's go out dancing
Go for the throat
Let's bury the hatchet
Wipe out the past
Make love together
Stay on the path
You're not the only one
With mixed emotions
And you're not the only ship
Adrift on this ocean
This coming and going
Is driving me nuts
This to-ing and fro-ing
Is hurting my guts
So get off the fence, now
It's creasing your butt
Life is a party
Let's get out and strut, yes
You're not the only one
With mixed emotions
And you're not the only ship
Adrift on this ocean
You're not the only one
That's feeling lonesome
And you're not the only one
With mixed emotions
You're not the only one
You're not the only one
You're not the only one
You're not the only one
Let's grab the world
By the scruff of the neck
And drink it down deeply
And love it to death
So button your lip, baby
Button your coat
Let's go out dancing
Let's rock 'n' roll, yeah
You're not the only one
With mixed emotions
And you're not the only ship
Adrift on this ocean
And you're not the only one (only one)
That's feeling lonesome
And you're not the only one
With mixed emotions
Mixed emotions
You're not the only one
You're not the only one
Gonna stick, keep it together, yeah
You're not the only one
You better stick, stick, stick together
You're not the only one
Pedal, gotta pedal my feet
You're not the only one
Move it around
You're not the only one
