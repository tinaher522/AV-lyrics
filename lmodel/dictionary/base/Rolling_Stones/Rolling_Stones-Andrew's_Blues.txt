Yes now Andrew Oldham sittin' on a hill with Jack and Jill (Jack and Jill)
Fucked all night and sucked all night and taste that pussy till it taste just right
Oh Andrew (yes Andrew) oh Andrew (yes Andrew)
Oh suck it Andrew (go on Andrew), fuck it Andrew (go on Andrew)
Oh Andrew Oldham (yeah) A guy who really know his way around
(down down down down)
Well I said I wouldn't lay you baby, till the day that we would wed
But every time I kiss you, you know, I forget just what I said
Well well I let you keep it tonight if you hold me, hold it real tight
Oh oo Andrew (oh Andrew) oh oh Andrew (yes Andrew)
Come and get it little Andrew, before Sir Edward takes it away from you,
Come on get her cunt Sir Edward, come on now
Huh huh  play the blues everybody, play the blues
Huh fuckin'! The Rolling Stones are a great fuckin' group
What a lot of balls, Phil Spector is a lot of shit
I though Phil Spector was a lot of shit
And I've heard the group, now I know their a lot of shit
That sure was fine (yeah baby)
Got my Beatles shoes on and I'm just raring to go
Oh Andrew (yes Andrew) oh Andrew (yeah)
Ah ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah ah,
Listen Andrew, Phil, Sir Edward Lewis, the Rolling Stones, the hottest
Phil Spector, Gene Pitney (thank you), musical radios
Birds, Al Davis showing up, ahh, yeah
(Great time man) That's all (great side man)
You know that Andrew got to walk with his baby,
Andrew has a talk with his baby
Now I know Andrew understood
That's what happen when the gettin' gets good
Oh Andrew (ba ba) oh Andrew (ba ba)
Suck it Andrew (ba ba) fuck it Andrew (ba ba)
