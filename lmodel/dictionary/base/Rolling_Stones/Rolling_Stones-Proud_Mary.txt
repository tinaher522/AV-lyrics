<song artist="Rolling_Stones" title="Proud_Mary">
You know, every now and then
I think you might like to hear something from us
Nice and easy but there's just one thing
You see, we never ever do nothing nice and easy
We always do it nice and rough
So we're gonna take the beginning of this song and do it easy
Then we're gonna do the finish rough
This is the way we do 'Proud Mary'
And we're rolling, rolling, rolling on the river
Listen to the story
Left a good job in the city
Working for the man every night and day
And I never lost one minute of sleeping
Worrying 'bout the way that things might have been
Big wheel keep on turning
Proud Mary keep on burning
And we're rolling, rolling
Rolling on the river
Cleaned a lot of plates in Memphis
I pumped a lot of tane down in New Orleans
But I never saw the good side of the city
Until I hitched a ride on the riverboat queen
Big wheel keep on turning
Proud Mary keep on burning
And we're rolling, rolling
Rolling on the river
Say, we're rolling, rolling
Rolling on the river
I left a good job in the city
Working for the man every night and day
And I never lost one minute of sleeping
Worrying 'bout the way things might have been
Big wheel keep on turning
Proud Mary keep on burning
Rolling, rolling
Rolling on the river
Say, we're rolling, rolling
Rolling on the river, the river
I cleaned a lot of plates in Memphis
And I pumped a lot of tane down in New Orleans
But I never saw the good side of the city
'Til I hitched a ride on the riverboat queen
Big wheel keep on turning
Proud Mary keep on burning
And we're rolling, so we're rolling
And we're rolling on the river
I tell you, we're rolling, rolling
We're rolling on the river
If you come down to the river
I bet you gonna find some people who live
And you don't have to worry if you got no money
People on the river are happy to give
Big wheel keep on turning
Proud Mary keep on burning
And we're rolling and we're rolling
And we're rolling on the river
Tell me one more time
(Rolling, rolling, rolling on the river)
(Rolling, rolling, rolling on the river)
(Rolling, rolling, rolling on the river)
(Rolling, rolling, rolling on the river)
(Rolling, rolling, rolling on the river)
