<song artist="Rolling_Stones" title="Memo_From_Turner">
Didn't I see you down in San Antone 
on a hot and dusty night?
You were eating eggs in Sammy's
when the black man there drew his knife
Aw, you drowned that Jew in Rampton 
as he washed his sleeveless shirt.
You know that Spanish-speaking gentleman, 
the one that we all call Kurt
Come now, gentlemen, 
I know there's some mistake
How forgetful I'm becoming
now you fixed your business straight
I remember you in Hemlock Road 
in ninteen fifty-six
You're a faggy little leather boy 
with a smaller piece of stick
Well, you're a lashin' smashin' hunk of man
Your sweat shines sweet an' strong
Your organ's working perfectly
but there's a part that's not screwed on
Weren't you at the Coke convention 
back in ninteen sixty-five
You're the misbred, grey executive 
I've seen heavily advertised
You're that great gray man 
whose daughter licks policemen's buttons clean
You're the man who squats 
behind the man who works the soft machine
Come now, gentlemen, 
your love is all I crave
You'll still be in the circus 
when I'm laughin' laughin' in my grave
When the old men do the fighting 
and the young men all look on
And the young girls eat their mother's meat 
from tubes of plasticon
Be wary, please, my gentle friends 
of all the skins you breed
They have a tasty habit, 
they eat the hands that bleed
So, remember who you say you are 
and keep your noses clean
Boys will be boys and play with toys 
so be strong with your beast
Oh Rosie dear, don'tcha think it's queer 
so stop me if you please
"The baby's dead" my lady said
you gentlemen, why you all work for me
