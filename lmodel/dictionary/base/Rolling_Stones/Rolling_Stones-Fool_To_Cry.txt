<song artist="Rolling_Stones" title="Fool_To_Cry">
When I come home, baby
And I've been working all night long
I put my daughter on my knee
And she says, "Daddy what's wrong?"
She whispers in my ear so sweet
You know what she says?
She says, "Ooh, daddy, you're a fool to cry
You're a fool to cry
And it makes me wonder why
Daddy, you're a fool"
You know, I got a woman
And she lives in the poor part of town
And I go see her sometimes
And we make love, so fine
I put my head on her shoulder
She says, "Tell me all your troubles"
You know what she says?
She says, "Ooh, daddy, you're a fool to cry
You're a fool to cry
And it makes me wonder why
Daddy, you're a fool to cry"
She says, "Ooh, daddy, you're a fool to cry
You're a fool to cry
And it makes me wonder why"
She says, "Ooh-ooh, daddy, you're a fool to cry
Ooh-ooh, you're a fool to cry
Ooh-ooh, daddy, you're a fool to cry
Ooh-ooh, daddy, you're a fool to cry"
Even my friends say to me sometimes
And make out like I don't understand them
You know what they say?
They say, "Ooh, daddy, you're a fool to cry
You're a fool to cry
And it makes me wonder why"
I'm a fool, baby
I'm a certified fool
Gotta tell ya, baby
I'm a fool, babe
Certified fool for ya, come on, yeah
I'm a fool
