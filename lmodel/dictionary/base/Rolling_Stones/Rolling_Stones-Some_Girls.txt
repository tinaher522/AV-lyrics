<song artist="Rolling_Stones" title="Some_Girls">
Some girls give me money, some girls buy me clothes
Some girls give me jewelry, that I never thought I'd own
Some girls give me diamonds, some girls, heart attacks
Some girls I give all my bread to, I don't ever want it back
Some girls give me jewelry, others buy me clothes
Some girls give me children, I never asked them for
So give me all your money, give me all your gold
I'll buy you a house in Baker Street, and give you half of what I own
Some girls take my money, some girls take my clothes
Some girls get the shirt off my back, and leave me with a lethal dose
French girls they want Cartier, Italian girls want cars
American girls want everything in the world you can possibly imagine
English girls they're so prissy, I can't stand them on the telephone
Sometimes I take the receiver off the hook, I don't want them to ever call at all
White girls they're pretty funny, sometimes they drive me mad
Black girls just wanna get fucked all night, I just don't have that much jam
Chinese girls are so gentle, they're really such a tease
You never know quite what they're cookin', inside those silky sleeves
Give me all you money, give me all your gold
I'll buy you a house in Baker Street, and give you half of what I own
Some girls they're so pure, some girls so corrupt
Some girls give me children, I only made love to her once
Give me half your money, give me half your car
Give me half of everything, I'll make you world's biggest star
So gimme all your money, give me all your gold
Let's go back to Zuma beach, I'll give you half of everything I own
