Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Watching girls go passing by
It ain't the latest thing
I'm just standing in a doorway
I'm just trying to make some sense
Out of these girls go passing by
The tales they tell of men
I'm not waiting on a lady
I'm just waiting on a friend
A smile relieves a heart that grieves
Remember what I said
I'm not waiting on a lady
I'm just waiting on a friend
Just waiting on a friend
I'm just waiting on a friend
I'm just waiting on a friend
Don't need a whore, I don't need no food
Don't need a virgin priest
I just someone, I can cry to
I need someone to protect
Ooh, yeah
I'm making love and breaking hearts
That as a game for youth
No, I'm not waiting on a lady, oh yeah
I'm just waiting on a friend
I'm just waiting on a friend
I'm just waiting on a friend
I'm just waiting on a friend
I'm just waiting on a friend
I'm just waiting on a friend
I'm just waiting on a friend
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
