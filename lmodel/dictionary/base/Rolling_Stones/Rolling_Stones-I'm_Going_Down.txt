<song artist="Rolling_Stones" title="I'm_Going_Down">
Hey babe, what's wrong with you, girl
the good lord bring your front dean
I have come around ringing your front door bell
Though our love fall down in dark clouds
Though I saw a man 
Alright 
Here we go down now
Here we go down
There's nothing for me but the powers that be
I know I, I know I, I know I,
That you're down
Oh you're going down
