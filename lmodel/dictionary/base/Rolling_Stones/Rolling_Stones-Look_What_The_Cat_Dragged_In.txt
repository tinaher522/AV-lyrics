I know that you like to go out drinking
And you love to have a good time
You came in when I was drinking coffee
Having breakfast on a bad night
I won't interrogate you and I never will berate you
About your lifestyle
But where you've been
Lost weekend
What's that look on your face
It must have been the walk of shame
Your eyes are all red, get ready for bed
Your hair's all over the place
And look what the cat dragged in
Don't you call me a friend
Get out of my house with your dirty old mouth
Take yourself out again
Look what the cat dragged in
Yeah, you take it right out again
Yeah, look what the cat dragged in
Yeah, take it right out again
Looking at the Sunday papers up with all the latest
It was so quiet
Checking what was going on in Syria and Lebanon
A bad fright, bad fright
Ain't going to criticize you and I hate to ostracize you
What a bad night
Where you've been?
Lost weekend
You look like your totally spaced
Your breath's got a horrible taste
You look like a leper, dressed as Sergeant Pepper
Are you going to throw up all over my face
Look what the cat dragged in
Take it right out again
Get out of my house with your dirty old mouth
Take it right out again
Look what the cat dragged in
Well, take it right out again
Look what the cat dragged in
Yeah, take it right out again
Well, look what the cat dragged in
Yeah, never do that my friend
Well, look what the cat dragged in
Look what the cat, look what the cat, look what the cat dragged in
