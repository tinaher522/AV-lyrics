<song artist="Rolling_Stones" title="Something_Happened_To_Me_Yesterday">
Something happened to me yesterday 
Something I can't speak of right away 
Something happened to me 
Something oh so groovy 
Something happened to me yesterday 
He don't know if it's right or wrong 
Maybe he should tell someone 
He's not sure just what it was 
Or if it's against the law 
Something 
Something very strange i hear you say 
You're talking in a most peculiar way 
But something really threw me 
Something oh so groovy 
Something happend to me yesterday 
(Yesterday) 
He don't know just where it's gone 
He don't really care at all 
No one's sure just what it was 
Or the meaning, end, or cause 
Something 
(What kinda joint is this) 
(Take your partners) 
Me don't know if it's right or wrong 
Maybe he should tell someone 
He's not sure just what it was 
Or if it's against the law 
Something 
Someone says there's something more to pay 
For sins that you committed yesterday 
It's really rather drippy 
But something oh so trippy 
Something happened to me yesterday 
He don't know just where it's gone 
He don't really care at all 
No one's sure just what it was 
Or the meaning, end, or cause 
Something 
Someone's singing loud across the bay 
Sittin on a mat about to pray 
Isn't half as looney 
As something oh so groovy 
Something happened to me yesterday 
He don't know if it's right or wrong 
Maybe he should tell someone 
He's not sure just what it was 
Or if it's against the law 
Something 
(spoken) 
Well thank you very much and now I think it's time for us 
All to go.  so from all of us to all of you not forgetting 
The boys in the band and our producer, Reg Thorpe, 
We'd like to say "God Bless"  So, if you're out tonight, 
Don't forget, if you're on your bike, wear white... Evening all.
