<song artist="Rolling_Stones" title="Mick_Jagger's_Introduction_Of_Rock_&_Roll_Circus">
You've heard of Oxford Circus; you've heard of Piccadilly Circus; and this is The Rolling Stones Rock &amp; Roll Circus. 
And we've got sights and sounds and marvels to delight your eyes and ears; and you'll be able to see the very first one of those in a few moments.
