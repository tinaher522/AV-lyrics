<song artist="Rolling_Stones" title="I_Love_You_Too_Much">
I think I decided to get out of the rain
I wasn't thinkin' I'd be stayin'
But when you pulled me off the door-step
Somehow I knew I'd end up paying
Somehow I knew I knew I'd end up paying - yes!
This thing that does the pa-in
'Cause I love too much
I can't help it if I love you too much
So much more than just a simple crush
I can't help it if I love you
I can't help it if I love you
You call it morbid fascination
I call it nasty education
Friends of mine, they all snicker and sneer
Their all laughin' while I cry in my beer
I never give-in
I get discourage but I never give-in
'Cause I love too much
I can't help it 'cause I love you too much
You got me dizzy like a martini lunch, I can't help it if I love you
I can't help it if I love you
I come to tell you that I'm sticking it out
I like your body obsession
You give me something I know nothing about
Instilling madness in my member
I can't fight my own obsession
You can call it, call a lesson
I love you too much
So much more than just a simple crush
You got me dizzy like a martini lunch, I can't help it if I love you
Love you too much
I can't help it if I love you
I can't help it 'cause I love you
I can't help it if I love you
I can't help it if I love you
