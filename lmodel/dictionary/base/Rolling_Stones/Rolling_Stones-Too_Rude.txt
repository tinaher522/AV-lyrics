<song artist="Rolling_Stones" title="Too_Rude">
Girl you're too bad 
Girl you're too rude 
Everyman I speak to says he wants you
Girl you're too bad 
Girl you're too rude 
Everyman I speak to says he wants you 
Everywhere 
All over the place 
Every man, he has a picture of your face 
Hey little girl 
Don't you realize 
This is a goddamn disgrace 
Girl you're too bad 
Girl you're too rude 
Everyman I speak to says he wants you 
Girl you're too bad 
Girl you're too rude 
Everyman I speak to says he wants you, yeah, oh yeah
Ooh little girl 
You never want me 
Tomorrow night you say you need my key 
Hey little girl 
Go and have a ball 
You know one day girl you're bound to fall 
Girl you're too bad 
Girl you're too rude 
Everyman I speak to says he wants you 
Girl you're too bad 
Girl you're too rude 
Everyman I speak to says he wants you 
Ooh, ah yeah
Girl you're too bad 
Girl you're too rude 
Everyman I speak to says he wants you 
Girl you're too bad 
Girl you're too rude 
Everyman I speak to says he wants you 
Everywhere 
All over the place 
Every man, he has a picture of your face 
Hey little girl 
Don't you realize 
This is a goddamn disgrace 
Girl you're too bad 
Girl you're too rude 
Everyman I speak to says he wants you 
Girl you're too bad 
Girl you're too rude 
Everyman I speak to says he wants you 
Girl you're too bad 
Girl you're too rude 
Everyman I speak to says he wants you 
Girl you're too bad 
Girl you're too rude 
Everyman I speak to says he wants you
