<song artist="Rolling_Stones" title="The_Nearness_Of_You">
Its just the nearness of you
Its not the pale moon that excites me
That thrills and delights me
Oh no
Its just the nearness of you
It isn't your sweet conversation
That brings this sensation
Oh no
Its just the nearness of you
When I'm in your arms
And I feel you so close to me
All my wildest dreams
Came true
Its just the nearness of you
I need no soft lights to enchant me
If you'll only grant me
The right
To hold you ever so tight
And to feel in the night
The nearness of you
The nearness of you
To feel the nearness of you
