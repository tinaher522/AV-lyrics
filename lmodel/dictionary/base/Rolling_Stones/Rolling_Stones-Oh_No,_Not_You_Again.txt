<song artist="Rolling_Stones" title="Oh_No,_Not_You_Again">
Here you stand before me
Waiting to be kissed
You're a beauty
Such a cutie
How could I resist?
It's been a month of Sundays
Since we last had spoke
So much water
You get dollars
I fell out the boat
Oh no, not you again
Fucking up my life
It was bad the first time
I can't stand it twice
Oh no, not you again
Well, I can't stand the pace
Once bitten, twice shy
Get me out of the race
The setting's so romantic
Love is in the air
All is perfect
But I'm allergic
To your business stares
You look so cool and tempting
In your couture dress
You're addictive
As predicted
I'm nervous, I confess
Oh no, not you again
Mashing up my life
It was bad the first time, yeah
You had me in a vice
Oh no, not you again
I hear ya and I shout
It was bad the first time around
When you turned me inside out
Well, everybody's talking
Showing up their wits
The moon is yellow
But I'm like jello
Staring down your tits
My life flashes forward
Then it flashes back
I'm still dreaming
And I'm screaming
"Get me off the rack!"
Oh no, not you again
I can't stand the pain
I was burned the first time, yeah
I can't deal it again
Oh no, not you again
Messing up my life, yeah
Once bitten, twice shy
But I can't do it twice
Oh no, not you again
Fucking up my life
It was bad the first time around
I better take my own advice
Oh no, oh no, oh nooooo!
