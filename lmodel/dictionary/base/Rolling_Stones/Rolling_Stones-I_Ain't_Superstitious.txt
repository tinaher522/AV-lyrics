<song artist="Rolling_Stones" title="I_Ain't_Superstitious">
Meet me on the bottom,
Bring me my running shoes.
When I come out the window,
We ain't got time to lose.
Well I ain't superstitious,
But a black cat crossed my trail.
Don't brush me with my broom, Babe,
I just might land in jail.
Well my right hand itchin', Babe,
I get smothered by the shore.
Look down you engine, Babe,
But somebody got to go.
Meet me on the bottom, Babe,
Bring me my running shoes.
When I come out the window, Babe,
We ain't got time to lose.
Well I hope you are listening,
When I come streaking by.
Got a bad old man, Babe,
And I'm too young to die.
Well I ain't superstitious,
But a black cat crossed my trail.
Don't brush me with my broom, Babe,
I just might land in jail.
Dogs been barking
All around my neighborhood.
You give a sign, Babe,
Ain't do nobody no good
