<song artist="Rolling_Stones" title="I'd_Much_Rather_Be_With_The_Boys">
Here I am 
All alone and all dressed up to kill 
Cause I'd much rather be with the boys 
Than be with you 
Here I am 
With the gang, I don't care where you are 
Cause I'd much rather be with the boys 
Than be with you 
I hold up my head up high when I walk down the street 
Now I'm a man I'm standing on my own two feet 
Don't try to call me cause now I know the score 
and now i know that I don't need you anymore 
Don't put me on 
It's over now, it's no good looking back 
Cause I'd much rather be with the boys 
Who's fooling who 
It's over now and you've had all your headache from me 
Cause I'd much rather be with the boys 
Yes I'd much rather be with teh boys 
Yes I'd much rather be with the boys 
And the boys and the boys they would 
Much rather be with the boys than with girls like you 
Girls like you 
Girls like you...
