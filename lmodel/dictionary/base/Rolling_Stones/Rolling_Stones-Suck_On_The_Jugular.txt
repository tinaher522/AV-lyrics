<song artist="Rolling_Stones" title="Suck_On_The_Jugular">
Been keeping cool, been lying low 
Been dancing smooth and dancing slow 
Keeping myself to myself, my nose is clean 
But I'm a man, not a machine
All get together and feel alright 
(All get together and feel alright)
All get together and rock all night 
(All get together and rock all night)
All get together and feel alright 
(All get together and feel alright)
Get ready 
For sure 
Okay 
Let's go 
Suck on the jugular 
Love to change my shape and change my name 
Want to get out of myself for a while, don't feel no shame 
I love men to be men and women women 
On special occasions, diving and dipping 
All get together and feel alright 
(All get together and feel alright)
All get together and fuck all night 
(All get together and fuck all night)
Alright 
Give me 
For sure 
Okay 
Let's go 
Suck on the jugular 
Okay 
Let's go 
Alright 
Oh, no 
Aha 
Alright 
Let's live lasciviously 
Down in the muck 
And when tonight's over 
You going to watch me blow and self-destruct 
All get together and feel alright 
(All get together and feel alright)
All get together and feel alright 
(All get together and feel alright)
All get together and feel alright 
(All get together and feel alright)
Get together 
All get together and rock 
All get together and rock 
All get together and rock all night
