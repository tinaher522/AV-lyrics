<song artist="Rolling_Stones" title="Under_My_Thumb">
Under my thumb
The girl who once had me down
Under my thumb
The girl who once pushed me around
It's down to me
The difference in the clothes she wears
Down to me
The change has come
She's under my thumb
Ain't it the truth, babe?
Under my thumb
Is a squirmin' dog who's just had her day
Under my thumb
A girl who has just changed her ways
It's down to me, yes, it is
The way she does just what she's told
Down to me
The change has come
She's under my thumb
Say, it's all right
Under my thumb
Is a Siamese cat of a girl
Under my thumb
She's the sweetest, oo, pet in the world
It's down to me
The way she talks when she's spoken to
Down to me
The change has come
She's under my thumb
Uh, take it easy, babe
Yeah
It's down to me, oh, yeah
The way she talks when she's spoken to
Down to me
The change has come
She's under my thumb
Yeah, it feels all right
Under my thumb
Her eyes are just kept to herself
Under my thumb
Well, I, I can still look at someone else
It's down to me, ih, that's what I said
The way she talks when she's spoken to
Down to me
The change has come
She's under my thumb
Say, it's all right
Ah, ah
Say, it's all right, oh
Say, it's all right
Ah, ah
Ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah, ah-ah
Ah
Take it easy, babe, ah
Take it easy, babe, ah
Feels all right, ah
Take it, take it easy, babe
Take it easy
