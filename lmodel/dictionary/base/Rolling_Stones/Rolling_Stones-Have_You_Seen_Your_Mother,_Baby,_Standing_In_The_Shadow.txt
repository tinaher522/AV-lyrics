<song artist="Rolling_Stones" title="Have_You_Seen_Your_Mother,_Baby,_Standing_In_The_Shadow">
Have you seen your mother, baby, standing in the shadow?
Have you had another baby, standing in the shadow?
I'm glad I opened your eyes
The have-nots were tried to freeze you in ice
Have you seen your brother, baby, standing in the shadow?
Have you had another baby, standing in the shadow?
Well, I was just passing the time
I'm all alone, won't you give all your sympathy to mine?
Tell me a story about how you adore me
Live through the shadow, see through the shadow
Live through the shadow, tear at the shadow
Hate in the shadow, and love in your shadow life
Have you seen your lover, baby, standing in the shadow?
Has he had another baby, standing in the shadow?
Just where have you been all your life
Talkin' about all the people who would try anything twice
Have you seen your mother, baby, standing in the shadow?
Have you had another baby, standing in the shadow?
Well, you take your choice and your time
The brave old world or the slide to the depths of decline
