<song artist="Rolling_Stones" title="Like_A_Rolling_Stone">
Once upon a time you dressed so fine
You threw the bums a dime in your prime,
Didn't you?
People'd call, say "Beware doll, you're
Bound to fall";
You thought they were all kiddin' you
You used to laugh about
Everybody that was hangin' out
Now you don't walk so proud
Now you don't talk so loud
Now you don't seem so proud
About having to be scrounging for your
Next meal 
How does it feel
How does it feel
To be without a home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone? 
You've gone to the finest school all right,
Miss Lonely
But you know you only used to get juiced
In it
And nobody has ever taught you how to
Live on the street
And now you find out you're gonna have
To get used to it
You said you'd never compromise
With the mystery trend, but now you
Realize
He's not selling any alibis
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
And ask him do you want to make a deal? 
How does it feel
How does it feel
To be on your own
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone? 
You never turned around to see the frowns
On the jugglers and the clowns
When they all come down and did tricks
For you
You never understood that it ain't no good
You shouldn't let other people get your
Kicks for you
You used to ride on chrome horse with
Your diplomat
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat
Ain't it hard when you discover that
He really wasn't where it's at
After he took from you everything he could
Steal 
How does it feel
How does it feel
To be on your own
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone? 
Princess on the steeple and all the pretty
People
They're drinkin', thinkin' that they got it
Made
Exchanging all kinds of precious gifts and
Things
But you'd better lift your diamond ring,
You'd better pawn it babe
You used to be so amused
At Napoleon in rags and the language that
He used
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't
Refuse
When you got nothing, you got nothing to
Lose
You're invisible now, you got no secrets to
Conceal 
How does it feel
How does it feel
To be on your own
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?
