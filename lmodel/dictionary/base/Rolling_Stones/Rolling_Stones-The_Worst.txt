<song artist="Rolling_Stones" title="The_Worst">
Well I said from the first
I am the worst kind of guy for you to be around
Tear me apart
Baby, including this old heart that is true
And never ever let you down
Hmm, you shouldn't stick with me
You trust me too much, you see
Take all the pain
It's yours anyway
Yeah, kid
Oh put the blame on me
You ought to pass, you see
Somewhere outside I threw love aside
Now, it's a tragedy
I said from the first
I am the worst kind of guy for you to be around
