<song artist="Rolling_Stones" title="Just_My_Imagination_Running_Away_With_Me">
I looked out my window and watched her as she passes by
An' I said to myself, I'm such a lucky guy
To have a girl like her is strictly a dream come true
And of all the girls in New York, she loves me true
Well, it was just my imagination, once again
Runnin' away with me
Just my imagination
Runnin' away with me
Soon we'll be married and raise a family
A boy for you, what about the little girls for me
I tell you that I, I am just a fellow with a one track mind, yes I
Whatever it is I want, I seek and I shall find
Well, it was just my imagination, once again
Runnin' away with me
Just my imagination
Runnin' away with me
It was just my imagination, once again
Runnin' away with me, yes, it was
Just my imagination
Runnin' away with me
Every night, I hope and pray
Dear Lord, hear my plea
Don't ever let another take her love from me
Or I will surely die
Her love is ecstasy
When her arms enfold me
I hear her tender rhapsody
But in reality, she doesn't even know me
Just my imagination
Runnin' away with me
Just my imagination
Runnin' away with me
Just my imagination
Runnin' away with me
Just my imagination
Runnin' away with me
Yeah, runnin' away with me
Yeah, runnin' away with me
Yeah, runnin' away, runnin' away
Runnin' away, runnin' away, run run
Runnin' away, runnin' away
Runnin' away, run run
