Keys to your love
I've got the keys to your love
No matter where I go baby, no matter what I do
I spend my whole life honey, just thinking of you
Yeah it don't seem to matter, who's right and who's wrong
I want to tell you how I feel now, in the words of this song
What now baby, put a spell on you
There ain't nothing that you're going to do
I've got the keys to your love
I've got the secret of your heart
No matter where you I go baby
We're not too far apart
I've got the keys to your love
I've got the secret of your heart
No matter where you I go honey
We're not too far apart
Now you try to lock me out, I can always get in
I've got every permutation, every code and every pin
I'm so crazy about you, yeah that's the word on the street
Yeah I bet you heard all about it from the people you meet
You know baby, I put a spell on you
Can't take it off now, there ain't nothing you can do
I've got the keys to your love
I play the keys of your heart
It sounds so sweet baby
Won't stop once it starts
I've got the keys to your love
I've got the secret of your heart
No matter where you go baby
We're not too far apart
You're all that I've got
Without you baby, my life's kind of shot
I look for your face
'Cause no one else could fill this space
Watch out baby, I put a spell on you
You can't resist it, I just hoodoo you
I've got the keys to your love
I've got the secret of your heart
No matter where I go baby
We're not too far apart
No matter where I go baby
No matter where I go sugar
I've got the keys to your love, baby
Keys to your love
Keys to your love
Keys to your love
Keys to your love
Keys to your love
