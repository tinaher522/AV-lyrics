<song artist="Rolling_Stones" title="Don't_Be_A_Stranger">
Well I haven't seen your face for years
I thought you had just disappeared
Don't you worry, what are friends for?
You can call me up most anytime
I never go to bed til five
Don't be a stranger
Just knock on my door
I heard you're in the south of Spain
Never coming back again
Don't be a stranger
A stranger no more
Don't be a stranger
Just knock on my door
Well the key is hanging on the chain
Are you still drinkin' the same champagne
While I been waiting on the fifteenth floor?
Have a glass while I light the fire
You still have those hungry eyes
Don't be a stranger
Just knock on my door
You can tell me about your escapades
The story of your lost decade
Don't be a stranger
A stranger no more
Don't be a stranger
Just knock on my door
(Hey baby)
Do you still drive the young men wild?
You were all so very versatile
I need your lovin' like never before
Well you walk with the same old swatch
I still got the same old couch
You see the painting that you always adored
And I love you sittin' in my chair
Come closer let me smell your hair
Don't be a stranger
A stranger no more
Don't be a stranger
Just knock on my door
Don't be a stranger
Don't be a stranger
Don't be a stranger
Don't be a stranger
Don't be a stranger
Don't be a stranger
