<song artist="Rolling_Stones" title="You_Must_Be_The_One">
I've been looking out baby for a girl for me.
When I saw you baby, I knew that I could see
You must be the one
You must be the one
You must be the one
You must be the one
When I saw your brown eyes and your teeth like pearls
You stood by your limousine lookin' like a proper girl
You must be the one
You must be the one
You must be the one
You must be the one
I know that I love you, It don't sound like it's true
I would do my very best to get right thru' to you.
You must be the one
You must be the one
You must be the one
You must be the one
