<song artist="Rolling_Stones" title="Little_Red_Rooster">
I am the little red rooster 
Too lazy to crow for day 
I am the little red rooster 
Too lazy to crow for day 
Keep everything in the farm yard
Upset in every way 
The dogs begin to bark
Hounds begin to howl 
Dogs begin to bark
Hounds begin to howl 
Watch out strange cat people
Little red rooster's on the prowl
If you see my little red rooster
Please drive him home
If you see my little red rooster
Please drive him home
Ain't had no peace in the farm yard 
Since my little red rooster's been gone
