<song artist="Rolling_Stones" title="Why_I_Sing_The_Blues">
People you all have been wonderin'
Wonderin' why I sing the blues?
Yes, you all have been wonderin'
Wonderin' why I sing the blues
Well I want you to just listen
And say that you're me instead of you
Yes, you want to or you do get married
To someone for the rest of your life
You want to or you do get married
To someone for the rest of your life
Yes, there's always someone else
Whenever you out of sight
You get the affection of a servant
And the kindness of a slave
You get the affection of a servant
And the kindness of a slave
Yeah you get the love of a dog
That can't even hear a word you say
I try to say something
People something just to pacify
I try to say something
People something just to pacify
Well I might not have lived right all of my life
But people please believe me I've tried
