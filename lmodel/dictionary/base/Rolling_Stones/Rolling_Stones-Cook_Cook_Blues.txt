<song artist="Rolling_Stones" title="Cook_Cook_Blues">
You gotta cook, cook, cook every mornin'
Cook, cook, cook every night
Work hard all of the daytime
And dance, dance, dance all the night
Everytime I'm hungry I get on my knees
You can cook, cook, cook every night 
Cook, cook, cook for your father
Look, look look for a wife
Took, took, took take a last glance
Before I disappear from sight
So cook, cook, cook
I'm hook, hook, hooked everytime
