<song artist="Rolling_Stones" title="Jiving_Sister_Fanny">
Jivin' Sister Fanny, told her man from Philadelphia, PA
Uh, huh, huh, huh
He tore down the station said she didn't like the way we played
Uh, huh, huh, huh 
If you got a favourite guy, get you babe, real no why
Man from you down inside, got it feathered by the while
Ooh, child, you got me walkin' down the broad highway
Uh, huh, huh, huh 
Now, Jivin' Sister Fanny got the brain of a dinosaur
Uh, huh, huh, huh
Well, she hocked my fancy mother and she hocked my electric guitar
Then she's waitin' in the store, tell her to wait, er, waitin' for
Glad she's on the waiting good
By Charles oh watch 'er, you wait good
Ooh, child, you got me walkin' down the broad highway
