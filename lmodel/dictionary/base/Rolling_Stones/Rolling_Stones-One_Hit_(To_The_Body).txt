<song artist="Rolling_Stones" title="One_Hit_(To_The_Body)">
You fell out of the clear blue sky 
To the darkness below
The smell of your flesh excites me
My blood starts to flow, so help me God
You burst in in a blaze of light
You unzippered the dark
One kiss took my breath away
One look lights up the stars
And it's, it's one hit to the body
It comes straight from the heart (straight from the heart)
One hit to the body
Sure went straight to the mark, so help me God 
(One more from the body)
(One more straight from the heart)
Yeah, it's one shot when you love me
And one shot when you leave
I don't need no security
I just need me some peace
And it's one hit to the body
It comes straight from the heart (straight from the heart)
One voice calls out my name
It sure went straight to the mark (straight from the heart)
One punch and you knocked me down
Tore my defenses apart
One round took me out of the game
You did me some permanent harm
It took just one hit
It took just one hit 
It ain't enough for me
It ain't enough for me (enough for me)
It ain't enough for me
It's hurting me, baby
Oh, your love is just sweet addiction
I can't clean you out of my veins
It's a lifelong affliction
That has damaged my brain
It took just one hit to the body
To tear my defenses apart (straight from the heart)
One hit to the body
Sure went straight to the mark (straight from the heart)
One hit to the body
It comes straight from the heart (straight from the heart)
One hit to the body, to the body, to the body
Comes straight from the heart
One more from the body
One more straight from the heart, straight from the heart
One more from the body
One more straight from the heart, straight from the heart
That's all it took, that's all it took 
Just one hit straight from the heart
So help me, so help me, so help me God 
So help me, so help me God 
(One more from the body)
(One more straight from the heart, straight from the heart)
(One more from the body)
(One more straight from the heart, straight from the heart)
