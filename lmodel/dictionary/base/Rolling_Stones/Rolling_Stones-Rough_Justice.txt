<song artist="Rolling_Stones" title="Rough_Justice">
One time, you were my baby chicken
Now you've grown into a fox
And once upon a time, I was your little rooster
But am I just one of your cocks?
It's rough justice on ya
You're going to have to trust me
It's rough justice
But you know I'll never break your heart
So put your lips to my hips, baby
And tell me what's on your mind
I know you've still got the animal attraction for me
It's been a long, long time
It's rough justice on ya
We never thought it risky
It's rough justice
But you know I'll never break your heart
You're feeling loose and lusty
So if you really want me
Yeah, it's rough justice
And you know I'll never break your heart, yeah
It's rough justice on ya
You think you really sussed me
It's rough justice
But you know I'll never break your heart
The first time I saw you, baby
You was springing like a young gazelle
And next thing I know, way down the road
You had me flying like a bat out of hell
It's rough justice on ya
Your eyes are too disgusted
You're going to have to trust me
But you know I'll never break your heart
I give you my position
Don't want no opposition
It's rough justice
But you know I'll never break your heart
Yeah
Come on, baby, woo
Come on, baby, now
