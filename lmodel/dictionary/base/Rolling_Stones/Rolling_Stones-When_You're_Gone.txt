<song artist="Rolling_Stones" title="When_You're_Gone">
I don't want to think about you when you're gone
I don't want to hear your voice talk on the phone
All those notes and all those cards
I'm going to throw them in the yard
I'm going to put them in the trash where they belong
I just want a clean slate, I think I will redecorate
Slap some fresh new colors on the walls
I'll throw away your letters and rip up all your sweaters
You can't haunt me, you can't taunt me when you're gone, ah yeah
Accentuate the positive, that's what the people say
Talk it up, don't let it get you down
But there's so many negatives that pass along the way
Throw them in the river, let 'em drown
Bury them in the ground, yeah
I don't want to read about you when you're gone
I don't want to hear about the things you've done
I put a filter in my brain, I want to cut out all that pain
I don't want to hear about you when you're gone
Don't want to hear those melodies, they're like a touch of leprosy
I've grown to hate our favourite song
If I hear it on the radio, I grab the damn remote control
You can't haunt me, you can't taunt me when you're gone, aah
When you're gone
All right
