<song artist="Rolling_Stones" title="Corrina">
Just when you think you know me, think again
(Corinna, Corinna, Corinna)
Hmm, ain't nothin' like my Corinna (Corinna)
(Corinna) Hmm, ain't nothin' like my Corinna (Corinna)
I got a bird wanna whistles
Baby, got a bird
Honey got a bird will sing
Baby, got a bird
Honey got a bird will sing
Without my Corinna
Sure don't mean
Sure don't mean a natural thing
Oh, I learned to love you
Baby, for I call
Honey, for I call your name
Baby, for I call
Honey, for I call out your name
I wouldn't trade your love for money
Baby, you're my warm hearts
Honey, you're my warm hearts flame
Oh, oh, oh (Corinna)
(Hmm, ain't nothing like my Corinna)
(Na, na, na, na, na, na, na (Corinna)
(Hmm, ain't nothing like my Corinna)
Have mercy, have mercy, baby
Honey, you're my hard luck
Baby, you're my hard luck soul
Honey, you're my hard luck
Women, on my hard luck soul
Got a rainbow round my shoulder
Shine like silver
Looks like some ol' fools' gold
(Ooh, ah, ooh)
(Corinna) Oh, oh
(Hmm, ain't nothing like my Corinna)
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, ooh
(Corinna) (Hmm, ain't nothing like my Corinna)
Well, I love you so much, honey
Gotta tell the world
Baby, baby, tell the world I do
(Corinna)
Oh, honey tell the world
Baby, tell the world I do
You know, you know, you know, you know
Ain't no man, ain't no man in fourteen countries
Gonna love me baby
Baby like the way you do
Hey, hey, hey
I got a bird wanna whistle
Baby, got a bird
Honey, got a bird will sing
Honey got a bird
Baby, got a bird that will sing
Oh, without my Corinna
Sure don't mean
Sure don't mean a natural thing
Gotta say it one more time (Corinna) Oh
(Hmm, ain't nothing like my Corinna)
Oh (Corinna)
(Hmm, ain't nothing like my Corinna)
Ain't nothin, nothin, nothin, nothin
(Hmm, ain't nothin like my Corinna)
Tell the world, tell the world about it (Corinna)
(Hmm, ain't nothin like my Corinna) Sing!
(Corinna) (Hmm) Ooh
(Ain't nothin like my Corinna) hee, hee
I like it when you...
(Hmm, ain't nothin like my)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, (Corinna) Oh
Corinna (Corinna)
(Hmm, ain't nothin like my Corinna)
Corinna, Corinna (Corinna)
(Hmm, ain't nothin like my Corinna)
Corinna, oh, oh, Corinna (Corinna)
(Hmm, ain't nothin like my Corinna)
