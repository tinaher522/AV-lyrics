<song artist="Rolling_Stones" title="Love_Is_Strong">
Your love is strong and you're so sweet
You make me hard, you make me weak
Love is strong and you're so sweet
And someday babe, we got to meet
A glimpse of you was all it took
A stranger's glance, it got me hooked
And I followed you across the stars
I looked for you in seedy bars
What are you scared of, baby?
It's more than just a dream
I need some time
We make a beautiful team, a beautiful team
Love is strong and you're so sweet
And someday babe, we got to meet
Just anywhere out in the park
Out on the street and in the dark
I followed you through swirling seas
Down darkened woods with silent trees
Your love is strong and you're so sweet
You make me hard, you make me weak
What are you scared of, baby?
It's more than just a dream
I need some time
We make a beautiful team, beautiful
I wait for you until the dawn
My mind is ripped, my heart is torn
Your love is strong and you're so sweet
Your love is bitter and taken neat
Love is strong, yeah (you're so sweet)
Love is strong, oh
You're so sweet
Love is strong
You've gotta meet, whoa yeah
(You're so sweet)
(You're so sweet)
(Got to meet)
(You're so sweet)
