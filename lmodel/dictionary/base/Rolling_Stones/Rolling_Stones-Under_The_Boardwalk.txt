<song artist="Rolling_Stones" title="Under_The_Boardwalk">
When the sun beats down 
And burns the tar up on the roof 
And your shoes get so hot 
You wish your tired feet were fireproof 
Under the boardwalk 
Down by the sea 
On a blanket with my baby 
Is where I'll be 
(Under the boardwalk) Out of the sun 
(Under the boardwalk) We'll be having some fun 
(Under the boardwalk) People walking above 
(Under the boardwalk) We'll be falling love 
(Under the boardwalk, boardwalk) 
From the sand you'll hear 
The happy sound of a carousel 
You can almost taste the peanuts 
And popcorn they sell 
Under the boardwalk 
Down by the sea, yeah 
On a blanket with my baby 
Is where I'll be 
(Under the boardwalk) Out of the sun 
(Under the boardwalk) We'll be having some fun 
(Under the boardwalk) People walking above 
(Under the boardwalk) We'll be falling love 
(Under the boardwalk, boardwalk) 
Oh, under the boardwalk 
Down by the sea 
On a blanket with my baby 
Is where I'll be 
(Under the boardwalk) Out of the sun 
(Under the boardwalk) We'll be having some fun 
(Under the boardwalk) People walking above 
(Under the boardwalk) We'll be falling in love 
(Under the boardwalk, boardwalk
