<song artist="Rolling_Stones" title="Let_Me_Down_Slow">
You look a little dressed up
You're acting way too smart
Your face a little bit flushed
For a walk in the park
And you're clutching your phone
As you walk in the dark
And your smile's got a twist
You're looking so hardcore
If you've something to say
Don't be too direct
'Cause I feel a little fragile
Don't hit the nail on the head
Why I said, baby, baby, let me down real slow
Oh no no no
Why I said, baby, baby, let me down real slow
No no no
There's a swish in your step
There's a gleam in your eye
Are you coloring your hair
With some new kind of dye
The first one to blink
Is the first one to fall
I don't want a confrontation
I've got my back to the wall
Oh I said baby, baby, let me down real slow
Oh no no no
Why I said, baby, baby, let me down real slow
Oh na na no
I said baby, baby, let me down real slow
Oh no no no
I said let me strech out in the afterglow
Oh na na na now I gotta go
Let me down real slow
Oh na na na
Baby, let me down real slow
