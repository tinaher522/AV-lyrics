<song artist="Rolling_Stones" title="Stealing_My_Heart">
Well, luck is expensive and freedom comes cheap
When love's on the menu, I don't drink so deep
Well I was just out there to have me some fun
But it's easier said than done
We're standing so far apart
We had a string of false starts
I can't seem to stop it now
It grows and it grows and it grows
Stealing my heart
Stealing my heart
Stealing my heart, yeah
My cards are on the table, you can look up my sleeves
You say you're honest but love is for thieves
Well I was just out there, chaste as a nun
But it's easier said than done
Yeah now, like a shot in the dark
You shoot me right out the park
I can't seem to stop it
It grows and it grows and it grows
Stealing my heart
Stealing my heart
Stealing my heart, yeah
Well you've got no money and I've got no charm
While you're in a panic, I stay so calm
Well I was just out there to have me some fun
But it's easier said than done
Yeah, I though I was shot open
Yeah, you were a walk in the park
I though you were dinner
But you were the shark
Stealing my heart
Stealing my heart
Stealing my heart, yeah
Stealing my heart
Stealing my heart, yeah
Stealing my heart, yeah
Stealing my heart, yeah
Yeah, stealing, stealing my heart, yeah
Stealing, stealing, stealing, stealing my heart, yeah
Come on, come on
Stealing
Stealing my, stealing my heart
Stealing my heart, yeah
