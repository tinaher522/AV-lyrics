<song artist="Rolling_Stones" title="Miss_You">
I've been holding out so long
I've been sleeping all alone
Lord I miss you
I've been hanging on the phone
I've been sleeping all alone
I want to kiss you
Oooh oooh oooh oooh
Oooh oooh oooh oooh
Oooh oooh oooh
Oooh oooh oooh oooh
Oooh oooh oooh oooh
Oooh oooh oooh
Well, I've been haunted in my sleep
You've been starring in my dreams
Lord I miss you, tonight
I've been waiting in the hall
Been waiting on your call
When the phone rings
It's just a friend of mine that say
"Hey, what's the matter, man?
We're gonna come around at twelve
With some Puerto Rican girls that are just dyin' to meet you
We're gonna bring a case of wine
Hey, let's go mess and fool around
You know, like we used to"
Aaah aaah aaah aaah
Aaah aaah aaah aaah
Aaah aaah aaah
Aaah aaah aaah aaah
Aaah aaah aaah aaah
Aaah aaah aaah
Ooh baby why you wait so long
Oh baby why you wait so long
Won't you come home, come home
I've been walking in Central Park
Singing after dark
People think I'm crazy
Stumbling on my feet
Shuffling through the street
Asking people, "What's the matter with you, boy?"
Sometimes I want to say to, to myself
Sometimes I say
Oooh oooh oooh oooh
Oooh oooh oooh oooh
Oooh oooh oooh
I guess I'm lying to myself
It's just you and no one else
Lord I won't miss you child
Aaah aaah aaah aaah
Aaah aaah aaah aaah
Aaah aaah aaah
Aaah aaah aaah aaah
Aaah aaah aaah aaah
Aaah aaah aaah
Lord, I miss you child
Aaah aaah aaah aaah
Aaah aaah aaah aaah
Aaah aaah aaah
Yes, baby
