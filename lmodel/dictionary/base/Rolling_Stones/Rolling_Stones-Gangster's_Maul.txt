<song artist="Rolling_Stones" title="Gangster's_Maul">
Baby ...and I went down town
Everybody said I was foolin' around
Pick me out from all the rest
And I love that...I gotta see it
And I seen it all, shinny cars 
Now baby...and it's all the same
Everybody told me, that...you are the same
I love that girl with all my heart
And I love my girl
I seen the world... shinny cars...again
I seen the world...shinny cars 
And I wish to hell, I never fell in love at all...again
I wish to hell, I never fell in love at all 
Gangster's Maul
Gangster's Maul...one more time 
Gangster's Maul
Gangster's Maul
