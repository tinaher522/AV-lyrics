<song artist="Rolling_Stones" title="Monkey_Man">
I'm a fleabit peanut monkey
All my friends are junkies
That's not really true
I'm a cold Italian pizza
I could use a lemon squeezer
What you do?
But I've been bit and I've been tossed around
By every she-rat in this town
Have you, babe?
Well, I am just a monkey man
I'm glad you are a monkey woman, too
I was bitten by a boar
I was gouged and I was gored
But I pulled on through
Yes, I'm a sack of broken eggs
I always have an unmade bed
Don't you?
Well, I hope we're not too Messianic
Or a trifle too Satanic
We love to play the blues
Well, I am just a monkey man
I'm glad you are a monkey, monkey woman, too, babe
I'm a monkey
I'm a monkey
I'm a monkey man
I'm a monkey man
I'm a monkey
I'm a monkey
I'm a monkey
I'm a monkey
I'm a ma-ma-ma-ma-monkey
I'm a ma-ma-ma-ma-monkey
I'm a ma-ma-ma-ma-monkey
I'm ma-ma ma ma ma-ma ma
Ma-ma ma ma ma-ma ma
Ma-ma ma ma ma-ma monkey
Oh, monkey
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Ma-ma ma ma ma-ma ma
Ma-ma ma ma ma-ma ma
Ma-ma ma ma ma-ma ma
