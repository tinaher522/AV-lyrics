<song artist="Rolling_Stones" title="Streets_Of_Love">
You're awful bright, you're awful smart
I must admit you broke my heart
The awful truth is really sad
I must admit I was awful bad
While lovers laugh and music plays
I stumble by and I hide my pain
The lights are lit, the moon is gone
I think I've crossed the Rubicon
I, I walk the streets of love
And they're full of tears
I, I walk the streets of love
And they're full of fears
While music pumps from passing cars
A couple watch me from a bar
A band just played the wedding march
And the corner store mends broken hearts
And a woman asks me for a dance
Oh, it's free of charge, just one more chance
Oh, but I, I walk the streets of love
And they're full of tears
And I, I walk the streets of love
For a thousand years
Oh, tell me now
I, Oh I walk the streets of love
Yeah, and they're drenched with tears, oh
You had the moves, you had the cards
I must admit you were awful smart
The awful truth is awful sad
I must admit I was awful bad
And I, I walk the streets of love
And they're drenched with tears
And I, I walk the streets of love
For a thousand years, oh
I, I walk the streets of love
And they're drenched with tears
Oh every night, oh there's only one and not enough for him
Oh I, yeah and they're full of tears
Oh everybody talk about it
Everybody be walking down it
Yeah but I found out, oh yes that I
Oh yes I do
Oh the streets of love
Yeah, they're drenched with, they're drenched in tears
I... oh yeah I don't want to
