<song artist="Rolling_Stones" title="Sparks_Will_Fly">
You'd better grease up, I'm coming back 
You're going to catch fire, pyromaniac 
You'd better shape up, you'd better get set 
I'm gonna burn up in the smoke of a jet 
Sparks will fly 
When I finally get myself back on you, baby 
Sparks will fly 
When I finally get myself back to you baby
Ooh, you're going to find out 
Going to scream and shout 
We're going to pierce through this drought 
Sparks will fly, yeah, sparks will fly 
You'd better stand back 
The flames are high 
Better get help 
Can't stop the fire 
Bell's going to ring 
Hear the alarms 
Better tell the fire chief 
To quit playing cards 
Sparks will fly 
When I finally get myself back on you, baby 
Sparks will fly 
When I finally get myself back on you, baby
Ooh, I'm gonna step on the gas 
Mmm, I want to get there really fast 
Mmm, I want to fuck your sweet ass 
Sparks will fly 
Sharks will cry 
Sparks will fly, hey
Mmm, I had a good sniff around 
Along old hunting grounds 
But I have never found 
A woman so hot 
Sparks will fly 
When I finally get myself back on you, baby 
Sparks will fly 
When I finally get myself back on you, baby
Ooh, my fingers are crossed 
The time that we lost 
I'm in total chaos 
Sparks will fly 
Sparks will fly, hey
Sparks will fly
(Sparks will fly)
(Sparks will fly)
(Sparks will fly)
(Sparks will fly)
