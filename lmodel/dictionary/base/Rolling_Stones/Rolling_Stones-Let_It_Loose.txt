<song artist="Rolling_Stones" title="Let_It_Loose">
Who's that woman on your arm 
All dressed up to do you harm 
And I'm hip to what she'll do, 
Give her just about a month or two
(Give her just about a month or two)
Bit off more than I can chew
And I knew what it was leading to, 
Some things, well, I can't refuse, (I can't refuse)
One of them, one of them the bedroom blues
(One of them the bedroom blues)
She delivers right on time 
I can't resist a corny line
But take the shine right off you shoes, 
Carryin', carryin' the bedroom blues
(Carryin the bedroom blues)
Oo... 
In the bar you're getting drunk, whoa yeah yeah
I ain't in love, I ain't in luck (let it loose) whoa no no no
Hide the switch and shut the light, (won't you shut it, won't you shut it)
Let it all come down tonight (let it all come down)
 
Maybe your friends think I'm just a stranger, 
Some face you'll never see no more (whoa no no, let it come down)
Let it all come down tonight (let it loose let it all come down)
Keep those tears hid out of sight, (let it loose, let it all come down)
Let it loose let it all come down...
Let it loose let it all come down...
Let it loose let it all come down...
Let it loose let it all come down...
Let it loose let it all come down...
Let it loose let it all come down...
Let it loose let it all come down...
Let it loose let it all come down...
Let it loose let it all come down...
