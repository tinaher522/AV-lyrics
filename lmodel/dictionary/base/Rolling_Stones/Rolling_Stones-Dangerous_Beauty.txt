<song artist="Rolling_Stones" title="Dangerous_Beauty">
In your high school photo
You looked so young and na√Øve
Now I heard you got a nickname
"The Lady with the Leash"
Was it funny on the midnight shift
I bet you had your fair share of stiffs
There were onerous odors
I've got to admit
'Cause you're a dangerous, dangerous
A dangerous beauty
It's so plainfully plain to us
You're doing your duty
Who you got there in that hood
You look so fancy in those photographs
With your rubber gloves on
You're a favorite with the Chiefs of Staff
You're doing such a wonderful job
You're a natural at working with dogs
Keeping everyone awake at night
With a touch of the prods
Well you're a dangerous, dangerous
A dangerous beauty
Yeah, disdainfully, painfully
A bit of booty, yeah
You're a dangerous, dangerous
A dangerous beauty
Beauty
Well you're a dangerous, dangerous
A dangerous beauty
If I was your captain
Would you salute me?
Well you're a dangerous, dangerous
A dangerous beauty
What I say?
Yeah everybody
Beauty
Everybody now, yeah
Are you one bad apple in a box
Yeah, dangerous
Dealing out electric shocks
I've seen the gloves coming off
Dangerous
If looks could be killing
I bet you shoot me now
