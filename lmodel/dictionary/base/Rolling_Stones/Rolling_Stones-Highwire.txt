<song artist="Rolling_Stones" title="Highwire">
We sell 'em missiles, we sell 'em tanks
We give 'em credit, you can call up the bank
It's just a business, you can pay us in crude
You'll love these toys, just go play out your feuds
We got no pride, don't know whose boots to lick
We act so greedy, makes me sick sick sick
So get up, stand up, out of my way
I want to talk to the boss right away
Get up, stand up, who's gonna pay?
I want to talk to the man right away
We walk the highwire
Sending men to the front line
Hoping they don't catch the hell-fire
Of hot guns and cold, cold lies
We walk the highwire
Sending the men up to the front lines
And tell 'em to hotbed the sunshine
With hot guns and cold, cold lies
Our lives are threatened, our jobs at risk
Sometimes dictators need a slap on the wrist
Another Munich, we just can't afford
We're gonna send in the 82nd Airborne
Get up, stand up, who's gonna pay?
I wanna talk to the boss right away
Get up, stand up, outta my way
I wanna talk to the man right away
We walk the highwire
Putting the world out on a dead lie
And hoping they don't taste the shell-fire
Of hot guns and cold, cold lies
We walk the highwire
Putting the world out on a dead lie
Catching the fight on a primetime
With hot guns and cold, cold lies
Get up, stand up
Dealer, stealer
Hey
We walk the highwire
We're sending men to the front line
And hoping that we backed the right side
With hot guns and cold, cold lies
We walk the highwire
We sending the men up to the front line
And hoping they don't catch the hell-fire
With hot guns and cold, cold, cold, cold, cold lies
Woah yeah
We walk the highwire
We walk the highwire, oh yeah
With hot guns and cold, cold, cold lies
Oh yeah
