<song artist="Rolling_Stones" title="You_Got_Me_Rocking">
I was a butcher cutting up meat
My hands were bloody, I'm dying on my feet
I was a surgeon 'til I start to shake
I was a fallin', but you put on the brake
Hey, hey, you got me rocking now
Hey, hey, you got me rocking now
Hey, hey, you got me rocking now
I was a pitcher down in a slump
I was a fighter taken for a sucker punch
I'm feeling bad, I guess I lost my spring
I was the boxer who can't get in the ring
Hey, hey, you got me rocking now
Hey, hey, you got me rocking now
Hey, hey, there ain't no stopping me
Hey, hey, you got me rocking now
Hey, hey, you got me rocking now
Hey, hey, you got me rocking now
I was a hooker losing her looks
I was a writer, can't write another book
I was all dried up, dying to get wet
I was a tycoon drowning in debt
I said hey, hey, you got me rocking now
Hey, hey, hey, you got me rocking now
Hey, hey, there ain't no stopping me
Hey, hey
Hey, hey, you got me rocking now
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, you got me rocking now
Hey, hey, hey, ah
Hey, hey, you got me rocking now
That's alright
Yeah, hey
