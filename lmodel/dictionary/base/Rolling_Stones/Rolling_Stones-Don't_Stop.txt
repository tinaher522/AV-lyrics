<song artist="Rolling_Stones" title="Don't_Stop">
Well you bit my lip and drew first blood
And warmed my cold, cold heart
And your wrote your name right on my back
Boy, your nails were sharp
Don't stop
Honey don't stop
Don't stop
Baby don't stop
Well I love your screams of passion
In the long hot summer night
But you pepper me with poison darts
And twisted in your knife
But don't stop
Honey don't stop
Don't stop
Baby don't stop
Well the only thing I ask of you
Is to hand me back some pride
Don't you dump me on some dusty street
And hang me out to dry
Don't stop
Honey don't stop
Baby don't stop
Baby don't stop
Ah honey
Yeah I'm losing you
I know your heart is miles away
There's a whisper there where once there was a storm
And all that's left is that image that I'll find a way
And some memories have tattered as they've torn
Don't stop
Don't stop
Baby don't stop
Baby don't stop
Honey honey
Baby don't stop
Baby don't stop
Come on honey don't stop
Well baby
Don't stop
Baby baby don't stop
My honey
Don't stop
Don't ya stop
No, I got a something good, and I'll find a way
Ah honey
Don't stop
Ah baby don't ya stop
