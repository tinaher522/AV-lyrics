<song artist="Rolling_Stones" title="Pass_The_Wine_(Sophia_Loren)">
Walkin' down the street wit' a sad face
Always complaining 'bout the rat race
Nobody said that life was free and easy
Your job it sucks, it's on the line
Your wife act mean, your kids all cryin'
I need something that's guaranteed to please me
But listen, I'll tell you
I'm glad to be alive and kicking
I'm glad to hear my heart's still ticking
So pass me the wine, baby, and let's make some love
Sometimes things don't work out the way you want
I don't know if I'm gonna laugh or cry
Uh-huh
Yeah
Mmm
Your friends'll never call you back
You're feelin' such a sad sack
Like some snack that's gone all cold and greasy, yes
The car you drive a rusty wreck
It's always you that pays the check
Who said life was warm and peachy?
But listen, yeah, I'll tell you
I'm glad to be alive and kickin'
My blood is up, my pulse is quickened
Pass the wine bowl but let's make some love
Sometimes things don't work out the way you want
I wonder why, I wonder why (ah yeah)
Sometime mistakes come back to haunt you, baby
And I don't know whether to laugh or cry (yeah)
(Yeah, c'mon)
I got to be alive and kickin'
Glad to be alive and kickin'
Glad to have a pot to piss in
Glad to be alive and kickin'
We got to be alive and kickin'
Got'n yeah, come on, got to be, come, come on, company, ha, got to be, good to be  
Good to be alive and kickin'
Good to be alive and kickin'
Glad to see the plot is thickenin'
Pass the wine, let's make some love
Let's make some love
Let's make some love
Let's make some love
