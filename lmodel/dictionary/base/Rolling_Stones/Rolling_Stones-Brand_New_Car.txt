<song artist="Rolling_Stones" title="Brand_New_Car">
I got a brand new car 
And I, I like to drive real hard 
I got a brand new car 
And I, I'm feeling good so far 
Take her on the highway for a little spin 
I want to see the kind of shape she's in 
And I, I got a brand new star 
Jack her up baby, go on, open the hood 
I want to check if her oil smells good 
Mmm, smells like caviar 
Give her some stick 
Push her too far 
Right to the brink 
Hear the motor running 
Yeah, she's right in sink 
Tell me if she's thirsty 
Would she like a drink
And I'm stopping at this bar 
Slinky like a panther 
You can hear her purr
Touch her on the seat
Go on, feel the fur
And I got a brand new star 
Mmm, feel the juice
Foot to the floor 
Take some abuse
Woah I, I got a brand new car
And I, I drive her in the dark, yeah
And I, I got a brand new car 
Mmm, I think I'll stop and park, alright
Mmm
I sit in the dark
I, here my credit card
