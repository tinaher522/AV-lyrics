<song artist="Rolling_Stones" title="Saint_Of_Me">
Saint Paul the persecutor 
Was a cruel and sinful man 
Jesus hit him with a blinding light 
And then his life began 
I said yes, I said yeah 
Augustine knew temptation 
He loved women, wine and song 
And all the special pleasures 
Of doing something wrong 
I said yes, I said yeah 
I said yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah 
You'll never make a saint of me 
Oh yeah, oh yeah 
You'll never make a saint of me 
And could you stand the torture 
And could you stand the pain 
Could you put your faith in Jesus 
When you're burning in the flames 
I said yes, mmm
And I do believe in miracles 
And I want to save my soul 
And I know that I'm a sinner 
I'm gonna die here in the cold 
I said yes, I said yeah 
I said yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah 
You'll never make a saint of me 
Oh yeah, oh yeah 
You'll never make a saint of me 
Oh yeah, oh yeah 
You'll never make a saint of me 
Oh yeah, oh yeah 
You'll never make a saint of me 
I thought I heard an angel cry 
I thought I saw a teardrop falling from his eye 
John the Baptist was a martyr 
But he stirred up Herod's hate 
And Salome got her wish 
To have him served up on a plate 
I said yes, yeah, I said yeah 
I said yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah 
You'll never make a saint of me 
Oh yeah, oh yeah 
You'll never make a saint of me 
Oh yeah, oh yeah 
You'll never make a saint of me 
Oh yeah, oh yeah 
You'll never make a saint of me 
I thought I heard an angel cry 
I thought I saw a teardrop falling from his eye
Mmm, yeah
I thought I saw an angel cry, mmm
You'll never make a saint of me 
You'll never make a saint of me
You'll never make a saint of me
