<song artist="Rolling_Stones" title="Before_They_Make_Me">
Worked the bars and sideshows along the twilight zone
Only a crowd can make you feel so alone and it really hit home
Booze and pills and powders, you can choose your medicine
Well here's another goodbye to another good friend
After all is said and done, gotta move while it's still fun
Oh, let me walk before they make me run
After all is said and done, I gotta move, it's still fun
I'm gonna walk before they make me run
Watched the taillights fading, there ain't a dry eye in the house
They're laughing and singing, started dancing and drinking as I left town
Gonna find my way to heaven, 'cause I did my time in hell, oh yeah
I wasn't looking too good but I was feeling real well
After all is said and done, I gotta move I had my fun
Let us walk before they make us run
After all is said and done, I did alright, I had my fun
I will walk before they make me
And I will walk before they make me run
I will walk before they make me run
I will walk before they make me run
'Cause after all is said and done, I gotta move I had my fun
Let me walk before they make me run
So let me walk before they make me run
I wanna walk before they make me run
Before they make me run
