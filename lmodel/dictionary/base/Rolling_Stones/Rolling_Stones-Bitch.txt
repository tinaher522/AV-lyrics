<song artist="Rolling_Stones" title="Bitch">
Feeling so tired, can't understand it
Just had a fortnight's sleep
I'm feeling so tired, I'm so distracted
Ain't touched a thing all week
I'm feeling drunk, juiced up and sloppy
Ain't touched a drink all night
I'm feeling hungry, can't see the reason
Just ate a horse meat pie
Yeah, when you call my name
I salivate like a Pavlov dog
Yeah, when you lay me out
My heart is beating louder than a big bass drum, all right
Yeah, you got to mix it, child
You got to fix it must be love
It's a bitch
You got to mix it, child
You got to fix it but love
It's a bitch, all right
Sometimes I'm sexy, move like a stud
Kicking the stall all night
Sometimes I'm so shy, got to be worked on
Don't have no bark or bite, all right
Yeah, when you call my name
I salivate like a Pavlov dog
Yeah, when you lay me out
My heart is bumpin' louder than a big bass drum, all right
I said hey, yeah, I feel all right now
Got to be a
Hey, I feel all right now
Hey hey hey
Hey hey yeah
Hey hey hey
Hey hey yeah
Hey hey hey
Hey hey yeah
Hey hey hey
Hey hey yeah
