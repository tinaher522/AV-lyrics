<song artist="Rolling_Stones" title="Gomper">
By the lake with lily flowers 
While away the evening hours 
To and fro she's gently gliding 
On the glassy lake she's riding 
She swims to the side 
The sun sees her dried 
The birds hover high 
I'd stifle a cry 
The birds hover high 
She moans with a sigh
