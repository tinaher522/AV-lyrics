<song artist="Rolling_Stones" title="Under_Cover_Of_The_Night">
Hear the screams from Center 42
Loud enough to bust your brains out
The opposition's tongue is cut in two
Keep off the streets 'cause you're in danger
One hundred thousand disparos
Lost in the jails of South America
Cuddle up, baby, cuddle up tight
Cuddle up, baby, keep it all out of sight
Undercover, keep it all out of sight
Undercover of the night
The sex police are out there in the streets
Make sure the pass laws are not broken
The race militia has got itchy fingers
All the way from New York back to Africa
Cuddle up, baby, keep it all out of sight
Cuddle up, baby, sleep with all out of sight
Cuddle up, baby, keep it all out of sight
Undercover, undercover
Undercover, keep it all out of sight
Undercover of the night
All the young men they've rounded up
Sent to camps back in the jungle
And people whisper, people double-talk
At once their fathers act so humble
All the young girls they have got the blues
They're heading on back to Center 42
Keep it undercover, keep it out of sight
Keep it undercover, keep it out of sight
Undercover, keep it out of sight
Undercover, keep it out of sight
Undercover of the night
Down in the bars, the girls are painted blue
Done up in lace, done up in rubber
The john's are jerky little G.I. Joe's
On R&amp;R from Cuba and Russia
The smell of sex, the smell of suicide
All these things I just can't keep inside
Undercover, keep it all out of sight
Undercover of the night
Undercover of the night
Undercover of the night
Undercover of the night
Undercover, undercover
