<song artist="Rolling_Stones" title="Please,_Please_Me">
(Lennon/McCartney) 
Last night I said these words to my girl
I know you never even try, girl
C'mon...C'mon...C'mon...C'mon...
Please please me, whoa yeah, like I please you 
You don't need me to show the way, love
Why do I always have to say "love"
C'mon...C'mon...C'mon...C'mon...
Please please me, whoa yeah, like I please you 
I don't wanna sound complainin'
But you know there's always rain in my heart (in my heart)
I do all the pleasin' with you, it's so hard to reason
With you, whoah yeah, why do you make me blue 
Last night I said these words to my girl
I know you never even try, girl
C'mon...C'mon...C'mon...C'mon...
Please please me, whoa yeah, like I please you
Whoa yeah, like I please you
Whoa yeah, like I please you 
Please Please Me (Lennon/McCartney)
