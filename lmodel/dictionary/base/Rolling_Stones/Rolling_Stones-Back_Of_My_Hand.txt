<song artist="Rolling_Stones" title="Back_Of_My_Hand">
I hear a preacher on the corner
Ranting like a crazy man
He says that trouble, troubles are coming
I can read it like the back of my hand
I see love, I see misery
Jamming side by side on the stage
In the wind, some mournful melody
I can read it like the back of my hand
The back of my hand
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
I see dreams, I see visions
Images I don't understand
I see Goya's paranoias
I can read it like the back of my hand
Read it like the ah, ah, ah, ah
Well, read it like the back of my hand
Oh yeah, woah yeah
Woah yeah
Read it like the back of my hand
