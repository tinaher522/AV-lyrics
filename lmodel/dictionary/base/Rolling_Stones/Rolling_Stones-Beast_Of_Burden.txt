<song artist="Rolling_Stones" title="Beast_Of_Burden">
I'll never be your beast of burden
My back is broad, but it's a-hurtin'
All I want, for you to make love to me
I'll never be your beast of burden
I've walked for miles, my feet are hurtin'
All I want, for you to make love to me
Am I hard enough?
Am I rough enough?
Am I rich enough?
I'm not too blind to see
I'll never be your beast of burden
So let's go home and draw the curtains
Music on the radio, come on, baby, sweet love to me
Am I hard enough?
Am I rough enough?
Am I rich enough?
I'm not too blind to see
Oh, little sister
Pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty girls
Oh, you're pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty girl
Pretty, pretty, such a pretty, pretty, pretty girl
Come on, baby, please, please, please
I tell ya
You can put me out
On the street
Put me out
With no shoes on my feet
But put me out, put me out
Put me out of misery
Yeah
All your sickness
I can suck it up
Throw it all at me
I'll just shrug it off
There's one thing, baby
I don' understand
You keep on tellin' me
I ain'tcho kinda man
Ain't I rough enough, ooh, baby?
Ain't I tough enough?
Ain't I rich enough, in love enough?
Ooh, ooh, ooh
I'll never be your beast of burden
I'll never be your beast of burden
Never, never, never, never, never, never, never be
I'll never be your beast of burden
I've walked for miles, my feet are hurtin'
All I want is you to make love to me
Yeah
I don' need no beast of burden
I need no fussin', I need no nursin'
Never, never, never, never, never, never, never need
