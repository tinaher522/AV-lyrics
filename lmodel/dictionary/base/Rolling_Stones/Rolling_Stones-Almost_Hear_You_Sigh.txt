<song artist="Rolling_Stones" title="Almost_Hear_You_Sigh">
I can almost hear you sigh
I can almost hear you cry
On every crowded street
All the places we would meet
What will I do without you
They say that life goes on
I'm feeling sorry for myself
I can't believe you're gone
And you acted much too calm
Turned on all the charm
You had a cold look in your eyes
(Ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh)
I can feel your tongue on mine
Silky smooth like wine
I'm living with those memories
That's all that's left of you and me
I can almost hear you sigh
Almost hear you cry
When you made sweet love to me (ooh)
And you turned on all the charm
Acted much too calm
You had a cold look in your eyes (ooh)
Did it mean nothing
Was it all in vain
Was I just your fool
Or was the pleasure pain
Have you set me free?
Or will I wake up in the morning
And find out it's been a bad dream?
(Ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh)
Come on, I beg you
I want to be your main man
I can almost hear you sigh
Almost hear you cry
When you make sweet love to me (ooh)
Almost see your smile
It stretched half a mile
You had a stone cold look in your eyes (ooh)
Yeah, oh
Come on
I will see you there
Don't need no photograph
Come on, come on girl
Nothing left to say now
Can't believe, can't believe you're gone
I just can't believe, can't believe you're gone
No, no
Come on, baby yeah
Ooh
