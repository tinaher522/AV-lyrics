<song artist="Rolling_Stones" title="She's_So_Cold">
I'm so hot for her 
I'm so hot for her 
I'm so hot for her 
And she's so cold 
I'm so hot for her 
I'm on fire for her 
I'm so hot for her 
And she's so cold 
I'm the burning bush 
I'm the burning fire 
I'm the bleeding volcano 
I'm so hot for her 
I'm so hot for her 
I'm so hot for her 
And she's so cold 
Yeah, I tried re-wiring her 
Tried re-firing her 
I think her engine is 
Permanently stalled 
She's so cold 
She's so cold 
She's so cold, cold, cold 
Like a tombstone 
She's so cold 
She's so cold 
She's so cold, cold, cold 
Like an ice cream cone 
She's so cold 
She's so cold 
And when I touch her 
My hand just froze 
Yeah, I'm so hot for her 
I'm so hot for her 
I'm so hot for her 
And even so 
Put your hand on the heat 
Put your hand on the heat 
Aw, come on baby, let's go 
She's so cold 
She's so cold, cold 
She's so c-c-c-cold 
But she's beautiful, though 
Yeah, she's so cold 
She's so cold 
She's so cold 
She was born 
In an arctic zone 
She's so cold 
She's so c-c-c-cold 
And when I touch her 
My hand just froze 
She's so cold 
She's so goddamn cold 
She's so cold, cold, cold 
She's so cold 
Who would believe 
You were a beauty indeed 
When the days get shorter 
And the nights get long 
Lie awake and the rain comes 
Nobody will know 
When you're old, when you're old 
Nobody will know 
That you was a beauty 
A sweet, sweet beauty 
A sweet, sweet beauty 
But stone, stone cold 
You're so cold 
You're so cold, cold, cold 
You're so cold 
You're so cold 
I'm so hot for you 
I'm so hot for you 
I'm so hot for you 
And you're so cold 
I'm the burning bush 
I'm the burning fire 
I'm the bleeding volcano
