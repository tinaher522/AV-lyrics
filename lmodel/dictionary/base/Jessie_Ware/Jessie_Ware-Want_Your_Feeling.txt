<song artist="Jessie_Ware" title="Want_Your_Feeling">
I should've told you my secret
But now I'm 'fore the month
Nobody seems to see it
I wanted it all
I couldn't help to notice
You're still on a state
How could you keep forgetting?
I wanted it all
Light still shining in the room
You left me here
I wanted to show you
I want to control you
Light still shining in the room
You left me here
I wanted to show you
I want to control you
Feeling
I want your feeling
Cause I need it
But you're leaving
I never showed you the real me
I hid it from myself
Nobody wanted to tell
Who I was meant to be, to be
Could you see while you stayed away?
Were you listening? Would it change the way?
Could you take? All of my secrets?
Would you hear? Would you believe it?
Light still shining in the room
You left me here
I wanted to show you
I want to control you
Light still shining in the room
You left me here
I wanted to show you
I want to control you
Feeling
I want your feeling
Cause I need it
But you're leaving
I'm gonna show, I'm gonna show you
I'm gonna show, I'm gonna show you
I'm gonna show, I'm gonna show you
I'm gonna show, I'm gonna show you
Feeling
I want your feeling
Cause I need it
But you're leaving
Feeling
I want your feeling
Cause I need it
But you're leaving
Feeling
I want your feeling
Cause I need it
But you're leaving
Feeling
I want your feeling
Cause I need it
But you're leaving
