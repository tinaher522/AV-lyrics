<song artist="Jessie_Ware" title="Cruel">
Oh-oh-oh-ah...
If I told you
What you said before
Would you be just as certain
What's going on?
Cause actions
(Actions)
Speak louder than the words you sowed
(And you ought to know)
I've been wonderin'
Why I'm holdin', still holdin' on
Do us both a favour
(Tonight)
If you want to do the real thing
(Make it right)
You need to mind your mind up
(Just try)
Do you feel me reach the end of the li-I-I-ine?
Never knew our love could be so cruel
(Be so cruel, be so cruel to me)
It's not just what you say, it's what you do
(What you do, what you do to me)
Never knew our love could be so cruel
(Be so cruel, be so cruel to me)
It's not just what you say, it's what you do
(What you do, what you do to me)
Oh-oh-oh-ah...
Your actions
(Actions)
They speak louder than the words you sowed
(And you ought to know)
Have you been wonderin'
Why I'm holdin', still holdin' on?
Do us both a favour
(Tonight)
If you want to do the real thing
(Make it right)
You need to mind your mind up
(Just try)
Do you feel me reach the end of the li-I-I-ine?
Never knew our love could be so cruel
(Be so cruel, be so cruel to me)
It's not just what you say, it's what you do
(What you do, what you do to me)
Never knew our love could be so cruel
(Be so cruel, be so cruel to me)
It's not just what you say, it's what you do
(What you do, what you do to me)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
You're so cruel to me
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Don't be so cruel to me
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
