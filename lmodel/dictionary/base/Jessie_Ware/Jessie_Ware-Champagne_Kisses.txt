<song artist="Jessie_Ware" title="Champagne_Kisses">
Who's fault is this
That I'm crazy about you
You are in every single dream
And I'm thinking about you
If you wanna do, do, do me right
Do, do, do, do, do
If you wanna leave it all tonight
Do, do, do, do, do
When there's nothing left
Except you and this
Champagne kisses
Champagne kisses
Champagne
When there's nothing left
Except you and this
Champagne kisses
Champagne kisses
Champagne
I count every kiss
Till I'm finally sleeping
This love supreme
That's why I'll always give in
If you wanna do, do, do me right
Do, do, do, do, do
If you wanna leave it all tonight
Do, do, do, do, do
When there's nothing left
Except you and this
Champagne kisses
Champagne kisses
Champagne
When there's nothing left
Except you and this
Champagne kisses
Champagne kisses
Champagne
All I want is your love
Don't give in
All I want is your love
Don't give in
All I want is your love
Don't give in
All I want is your
All I want is your
When there's nothing left
Except you and this
Champagne kisses
Champagne kisses
Champagne
When there's nothing left
Except you and this
Champagne kisses
Champagne kisses
Champagne
And I won't be mad
I won't be mad
Champagne kisses
And I won't be mad
I won't be mad
Champagne kisses
