(You keep me, you keep me...)
Keep me running, you keep me running...
I'm lost again, it's happening
When you're around I just go weak
All I wanna know, is it mutual
Then I'm ready to run, ready to fall
Think I'm ready l
I'm lost again, it's happening
When you're around I just go weak
All I wanna know, is it mutual
And I'm ready to run, ready to fall
Think I'm ready to lose it all
I'm lost again, it's happening
When you're around I just go weak
All I wanna know, is it mutual
Then I never want to leave
Then I'm ready to run, ready to fall
Think I'm ready to lose it all
And I'm ready to run, ready to fall
Think I'm ready to lose it all
I'm lost again, it's happening
When you're around I just go weak
All I wanna know, is it mutual
Then I never want to leave
Then I'm ready to run, ready to fall
Think I'm ready to lose it all
And I'm ready to run, ready to fall
Think I'm ready to lose it all
Ohh, would you hold my hand like the air was so gently here
Ohh, would you pull me close so nobody knows we're there
No one can find us
Ohh, would you hold my hand like the air was so gently here
Ohh, would you pull me close so nobody knows we're there
No one can find us
I'm lost again, it's happening
When you're around I just go weak
All I wanna know, is it mutual
Then I never want to leave
Then I'm ready to run, ready to fall
Think I'm ready to lose it all
And I'm ready to run, ready to fall
Think I'm ready to lose it all
(You keep me, you keep me...)
Keep me running, you keep me running...
I'm lost again, it's happening
When you're around I just go weak
All I wanna know, is it mutual
Then I never want to leave
Then I'm ready to run, ready to fall
Think I'm ready to lose it all
And I'm ready to run, ready to fall
Think I'm ready to lose it all
Ohh, would you hold my hand like the air was so gently here
Ohh, would you pull me close so nobody knows we're there
No one can find us
Ohh, would you hold my hand like the air was so gently here
Ohh, would you pull me close so nobody knows we're there
No one can find us
(You keep me, you keep me...)
Keep me running, you keep me running...
