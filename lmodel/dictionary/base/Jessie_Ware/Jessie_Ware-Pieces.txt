<song artist="Jessie_Ware" title="Pieces">
A reason to live, reason to love
You gave me them both and more yet,
A reason to fall, and a reason to hide
Suddenly all I'm left with...
I was so sure this was real, but
Now I'm sure of nothing at all
I had to shatter to pieces
You made me reveal myself, reveal myself
So if you no longer need them
Then give them to someone else
Take what you gave
And throw it away
Now everything's changed, it's misplaced
Nothing to say, cause' I'm not the same
It's almost as if we just met
I was so sure this was real but
Now I'm sure of nothing at all
I had to shatter to pieces
You made me reveal myself, reveal myself
Now that you no longer need them
I'll give them to someone else
It's illogical, I was nothing without you
But you ought to know
I was lost when I had found you
I had to shatter to pieces
Made me reveal myself, reveal myself
Now that you no longer them, I'll give them someone else
To someone else
I had to shatter to pieces
Made me reveal myself, reveal myself
Now that you no longer them
I'll give them someone else
To someone else
