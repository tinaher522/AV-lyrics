<song artist="Jessie_Ware" title="Sweet_Talk">
I thought you knew
I had to stay away from you
I thought you heard
Yeah, still you have the power
You can't be here, how long do you disappear?
Don't wanna be the best one here
But you gimme the sweet talk
And it works for me
And it's the sweet words
That pulls me in
I know I'm the weak one
And I won't say no
You gimme a reason
So, I never go
Don't keep me with the kisses
There's never any there when I need
It's just that you can always make me feel like I am slipping in
Way too deep
And let the shadows hope to hide the break o' dreamin'
Dreamin' of us
And if I keep slippin' in, just keep up with the talking
Know that I'll wait for you, I'm not about to go
But you gimme the sweet talk
And it works for me
And it's the sweet words
That pulls me in
I know I'm the weak one
And I won't say no
You gimme a reason
So, I never go
So many moments we waste
Too many heartbeats away
So many moments we waste
Too many heartbeats away
But you gimme the
But you gimme the
But you gimme the
But you gimme the
But you gimme the sweet talk
And it works for me
And it's the sweet words
That pulls me in
I know I'm the weak one
And I won't say no
You gimme a reason
So, I never go
You gimme the sweet talk
And it works for me
And it's the sweet words (Too many heartbeats away)
That pulls me in
I know I'm the weak one (I know I'm the weak one)
And I won't say no
You gimme a reason
So, I never go
You gimme the sweet words
Sweet words
Gimme the sweet talk
