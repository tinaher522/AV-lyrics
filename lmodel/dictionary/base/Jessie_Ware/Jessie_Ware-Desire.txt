<song artist="Jessie_Ware" title="Desire">
(Ooh, ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh, ooh)
You're my desire
And this, I always know
You've been admired
And do you see me glow?
Take me as I am
Take me as I am
Don't want to be left alone
Take me in your arms
Take me in your hands
Love me like we used to know
Am I seeing?
Am I feeling now?
That I want you
That I need you
My desire, desire (ooh)
My desire
We stick together
From a kiss I've met before
And [?] leave your lover
It's a cast that's still a [?]
Take me as I am
Take me as I am
Don't want to be left alone
Take me in your arms
Take me in your hands
Love me like we used to know
Am I seeing?
Am I feeling now?
That I want you
That I need you
My desire, desire (ooh)
My desire
My, my-my-my, my-my-my
My desire
And I need you, oh-ohh
And I need you, oh-ohh
And I need you, oh-ohh
And I need you, oh-ohh
