<song artist="Jessie_Ware" title="Taking_In_Water">
I wish I was you
A piece of gold of the bottom of the blue
Too heavy to swim
But too beautiful to lose
Holding my breath
Diving down to give you air
I never knew
The colours that surround you
(Look up, look up)
Holding on forever to keep you (Look up, look up)
To keep from slipping too deep (Look up, look up)
If you want to escape you don't need to (Look up, look up)
(Just look for me)
I'm taking in water for you, my love (Just look for me)
Pulling you out, I'll take the blue away (Just look for me)
I'm taking water, my brother, remember (Just look for me)
I'm taking water for you (Just look for)
You picked up the light
The spectrum back to turn to white
Too bright to be seen
I wish the beautiful boy was me
Never alone, sky's a different shade of grey
Making you glow, the colours dance around you
(Look up, look up)
Holding on forever to keep you (Look up, look up)
To keep from slipping too deep (Look up, look up)
If you want to escape you don't need to (Look up, look up)
(Just look for me)
I'm taking in water for you, my love (Just look for me)
Pulling you out, I'll take the blue away (Just look for me)
I'm taking water, my brother, remember (Just look for me)
I'm taking water for you (Just look for)
Treasures are lost on the bet and you bury it down in your soul
You bury it down in your soul
Your soul
(Look up, look up)
Holding on forever to keep you (Look up, look up)
To keep from slipping too deep (Look up, look up)
If you want to escape you don't need to (Look up, look up)
(Just look for me)
I'm taking in water for you, my love (Just look for me)
Pulling you out, I'll take the blue away (Just look for me)
I'm taking water, my brother, remember (Just look for me)
I'm taking water for you (Just look for)
(Just look for me)
(Just look for me)
(Just look for me)
(Just look for me)
