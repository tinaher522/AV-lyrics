<song artist="Jessie_Ware" title="Keep_On_Lying">
Always have you right here to follow
Keep your hands over my eyes so
I don't want to see where this will go
I will keep my eyes closed
Only know what was behind me
But I don't want to see what's in front, you lead
You give me directions every time you speak
This has got to be the best thing that I ever felt
Feels like heaven in hell
Is it real?
I can't tell
I can't tell
If this is good love
Then I don't want to know (know), no, no, oh-oh
If this is good love
Then I don't want to know (know), no, no, oh-oh
And I don't want to hear all the honesty
We'll be waking up to fantasy
But can we keep it up, can we just believe
That it's exactly as it seems?
This has got to be the best thing that I ever felt
Feels like heaven in hell
Is it real?
I can't tell
I can't tell
If this is good love
Then I don't want to know (know), no, no, oh-oh
If this is good love
Then I don't want to know (know), no, no, oh-oh
Keep on lying to me
Keep on lying to me, darling
Keep on lying to me, baby
If this is good love
Then I don't want to know, no, no, oh-oh
If this is good love
Then I don't want to know (know), no, no, oh-oh
(Ooooh-ooooh-oooh)
