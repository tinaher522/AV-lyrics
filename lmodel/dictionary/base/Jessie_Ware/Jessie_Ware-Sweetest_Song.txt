<song artist="Jessie_Ware" title="Sweetest_Song">
You're always in my head
It never stops
The melody repeats
Now I am lost
Lost beneath your sound
I hear it now
Even when you're not around
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Can you hear it?
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
I could hear your song forever
You're the sweetest, sweetest song
I could hear your song forever
You're the sweetest, sweetest one
I could hear your song forever
You're the sweetest, sweetest song
I could hear your song forever
You're the sweetest, sweetest one
How did you get here?
When did it begin?
No one else can hear us here
Now when did we fall in
I hope it never ends
As long as we have hearts to heal
As long as we live
As long as we cherish
As long as we give
I could hear your song forever
You're the sweetest, sweetest song
I could hear your song forever
You're the sweetest, sweetest one
I could hear your song forever
You're the sweetest, sweetest song
I could hear your song forever
You're the sweetest, sweetest one
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
I could hear your song forever
You're the sweetest, sweetest song
I could hear your song forever
You're the sweetest, sweetest one
I could hear your song forever
You're the sweetest, sweetest song
I could hear your song forever
You're the sweetest, sweetest one
I could hear your song forever
I could hear your song forever
I could hear your song forever
You're the sweetest, sweetest song
I could hear your song forever
You're the sweetest, sweetest one
