<song artist="Jessie_Ware" title="Something_Inside">
Dreamy haze can blind me
To take me where the tide lines will find me
Underneath and in between
Swallowed up you come for me, I see you
Offer me something inside
A place to go, a place to hide
Offer me something inside
Offer me something inside
A place to go, a place to hide
Offer me something inside
Come along, look down below
I want to go everywhere you go
You know the best, I catch my breath
So, steal me, take me in, I want you
Offer me something inside
A place to go, a place to hide
Offer me something inside
Offer me something inside
A place to go, a place to hide
Offer me something inside
Let me run, let me feel like someone
Let me run, let me feel like someone
Let me run, let me feel like someone (Cover pins me down, heavy like I swallowed a stone...)
Let me run, let me feel like someone (Cover pins me down, heavy like I swallowed a stone...)
Let me run, let me feel like someone (Cover pins me down, heavy like I swallowed a stone...)
(Cover pins me down, heavy like I swallowed a stone...)
I can hear my name, I am on my way (Let me run, let me feel like someone)
I can see your face, I will find you
(Cover pins me down, heavy like I swallowed a stone...)
I can hear my name, I am on my way (Let me run, let me feel like someone)
I will see your face, I will find you
I can hear my name, I am on my way (Let me run, let me feel like someone)
I will see your face, I will find you
I can hear my name, I am on my way (Let me run, let me feel like someone)
I can see your face
Offer me something inside
A place to go, a place to hide
Offer me something inside
Offer me something inside
A place to go, a place to hide
Offer me something inside
Offer me something inside (Let me run, let me feel like someone)
A place to go, a place to hide
Offer me something inside
Offer me something inside (Let me run, let me feel like someone)
A place to go, a place to hide
Offer me something inside
