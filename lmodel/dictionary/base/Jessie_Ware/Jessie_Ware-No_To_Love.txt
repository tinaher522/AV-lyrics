(Who says no?)
Who says no to love?
Who says no to love?
(Who says no?)
Who says no to love?
(Who says no?)
No to love
No to love (Love)
(No)
(No)
Who says no to love?
Who says no to love?
Who says no to love?
What was I thinking of?
Who says no to love?
Who says no to love?
Who says no to love?
And what were you thinking of?
No to love
(Who says no?)
No to love
(Who says no?)
No to love
(Who says no to love?)
No to love
(And what were you thinking of?)
(No to love)
Who says no to love?
(No to love)
Who says no to love?
(No to love)
Who says no to love?
(No to love)
And what were we thinking of?
No to love
Smashed on sours
Felt like the man of the hour
When we first met
I can't deny the power
Could you feel it, feel it, feel it in the air?
Love was all around us, love was everywhere
You said, "Who says no to love?"
They understand the consequence
Ask for permission
Endless rendition
A life without you
Forever I'll be missing
Without you
Forever I'll be missing
(And what were you thinking of?)
No to love
No to love
No to love
No to love
And what were we thinking of?
