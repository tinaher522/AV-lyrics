<song artist="Jessie_Ware" title="Running">
Your words alone
Could drive me to
A thousand tears
All the same words
That kept me here
For all the years
I'm lost again, it's happening
When you're around I just go weak
All I wanna know, is it mutual?
Then I never want to leave
Then I'm ready to run, I'm ready to fall
I think I'm ready to lose it all
And I'm ready to run, ready to fall
I think I'm ready to lose it all
Keep me running, you keep me running
Keep me running, you keep me running
Keep me running, you keep me running
Keep me running, you keep me running
You keep me
Me running
(Oh)
Oh
Would you hold my hand lightly, ever so gently here
Never give up (Never give up)
Oh
Would you pull me in closer, nobody knows we're there
No one can find us
I'm lost again, it's happening
When you're around I just go weak
All I wanna know, is it mutual?
Then I never want to leave
Then I'm ready to run, I'm ready to fall
I think I'm ready to lose it all
And I'm ready to run, ready to fall
I think I'm ready to lose it all
Keep me running, you keep me running
Keep me running, you keep me running
Keep me running, you keep me running
Keep me running, you keep me running
You keep me
Keep me running (The sun will come out)
Keep me running
And I'm lost again, it keeps happening
But when I'm around you, when I'm around you
I just go weak
All I wanna know, is it mutual?
Am I'm ready to run, am I ready to fall?
I think I'm ready just to lose it all
Keep me running, you keep me running
Keep me running, you keep me running
Keep me running, you keep me running
Keep me running, you keep me running
Me running
(Never give up)
(Never give up)
Keep me running, you keep me running
Keep me running, you keep me running ('Cause you'll never give up)
Keep me running, you keep me running
Keep me running, you keep me running ('Cause you'll never give up)
You keep me
