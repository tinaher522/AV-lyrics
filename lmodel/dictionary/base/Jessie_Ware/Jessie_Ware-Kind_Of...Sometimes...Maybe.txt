<song artist="Jessie_Ware" title="Kind_Of...Sometimes...Maybe">
Do I get lonely at all?
No, cause Jamie and Johnny and Jack keep me warm
This wasn't my fault
I don't cry, God no, I don't cry
Could you just leave it alone?
You keep haunting my nights
You keep asking me twice
If I miss you at all
And I won't lie, though I try
Oh kind of, sometimes, maybe
Kind of, sometimes, maybe
Oh kind of, sometimes, maybe
Kind of, sometimes
Kind of, sometimes, maybe
I'm less afraid of the dark
No bright ideas, I keep the lights on
Are you wasting my time?
And your time, every time?
Why you're makin' it hard?
I won't show you my cards
But you came and you lost
Do I want you at all?
OK, just a bit, I hate to admit
Oh kind of, sometimes, maybe
Kind of, sometimes, maybe
Oh kind of, sometimes, maybe
Kind of, sometimes
Kind of, sometimes, maybe
I just sit here and I'm thinkin'
If I still want you?!
So why say
Kind of, sometimes, maybe
Kind of, sometimes, maybe
Kind of, sometimes, maybe
Kind of, sometimes, maybe
Kind of, sometimes, maybe
