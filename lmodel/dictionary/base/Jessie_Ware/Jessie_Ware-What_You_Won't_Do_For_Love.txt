<song artist="Jessie_Ware" title="What_You_Won't_Do_For_Love">
I guess you wonder where I've been
I search to find a love with him
I came back to let you know
Gotta think for you
And I can't let go
My friends wonder what is wrong with me
What am in that days
From your love, you see
I came back to let you know
Gotta think for you
And can't let go
See people go around the world for love
The thing they never find
The daydream of
What you won't you
Do for love
You tried everything
But you don't give up
In my world only you
Let me do for love
What I would not do
My friends wonder what is wrong with me
What am in that days
From your love, you see
I came back to let you know
Gotta think for you
And I can't let go
And though I only want the besty true
I can believe the things
I do for you
What you won't you
Do for love
You tried everything
But you won't give up
In my world it's only you
Let me do for love
What I would not do
What I would not do
What I would not do
What I would not do
What I would not do
I don't want to be bowled
Boy I gotta to let you know
Jessie got a thing for you
I can't let go
I don't want to be bowled
Boy I gotta to let you know
Boy you knock me out
What I want to do
What I want to do
What I want to do
Do for love
What I want to do
What I want to do
I want to do
Do for love
