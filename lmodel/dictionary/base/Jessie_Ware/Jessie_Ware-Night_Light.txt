<song artist="Jessie_Ware" title="Night_Light">
Here in the dark, it's funny how
I never feel alone (I never feel alone)
Do you?
Here in the shadows
Away from the light
This darkness under which we hide
Like a ghost, I cannot see
You're the shadow behind me
You'll be my night light
There when I go to sleep
You'll be my night light
Baby, when I dream
Under the moonlight
Shining on the sea
You'll be my night light
Watching over me
Behind the glass
He'll never leave
Let's me in when I don't deserve to be
(Strong when I am week)
And I wish he caught
How this heart soars
Shadow man, will you come for me?
Like a ghost I cannot see
You're the shadow behind me
You'll be my night light
There when I go to sleep
You'll be my night light
Baby, when I dream
Under the moonlight
Shining on the sea
You'll be my night light
Watching over me
Not the way for us to go, tell me where to follow
I'm happy to be told, happy to be told
I'm taking it apart for you to see I could be falling to pieces
So, let me fall, let me fall into your shades
You'll be my night light
There when I go to sleep
You'll be my night light
Baby, when I dream
Under the moonlight
Shining on the sea
You'll be my night light
Watching over me
Watching over me
Watching over me
