<song artist="Jessie_Ware" title="Tough_Love">
It's already that time that you hope my mind is true
And I've been thinking of what to say or not to do
So you wanna be a man about it, do you?
And have you figured out all you wanted, have you?
When your heart becomes a million different pieces
That's when you won't be able to recognize this feeling
That's called tough love
That's called tough love
That's called tough love
That's called tough love
In the middle of the night all I think about is you
I dream in all your clouds of glory, it's true
So you wanna be a man about it, do you have to?
And have you figured out all you wanted, have you?
When your heart becomes a million different pieces
That's when you won't be able to recognize this feeling
That's called tough love (tough love)
That's called tough love (tough love)
That's called tough love (tough love)
That's called tough love (tough love)
You have me crying out, crying out for more
You have me crying out, crying out for more
You have me crying out, crying out for more
You have me crying out, crying out for more
That's called tough love (tough love)
That's called tough love (tough love)
That's called tough love (tough love)
That's called tough love (tough love)
