<song artist="Jessie_Ware" title="Still_Love_Me">
See it in your eyes
See it in your face, in your look
See it in you
If I make myself understood
Will you treat me like you know you should?
Still love me?
Still love me?
(Do you love me?)
Still love me?
(Do you love) Do you love me?
Still love me?
See, it's been a while
Looking through your eyes
I was taken in
Taken by surprise
Why did you want me?
Why'd you stay so close?
You're still not leaving
Was I enough?
If I make myself understood
Will you treat me like you know you should?
Still love me?
Still love me?
(Do you love me?)
Still love me?
(Do you love) Do you love me?
Still love me?
Still love me?
Do you love me?
Do you?
Do you love, do you love, do you still love me?
You're the one that's more
Easy to adore
I don't ever have to leave
If you still want me
If I make myself understood
Will you treat me like you know you should?
(Do you love me?)
Still love me?
(Do you love me?)
Still love me?
(Do you love me?)
Still love me?
(Do you love) Do you love me?
Still love me? (Do you love me?)
Still love me? (Do you, do you, do you still love me?)
Still love me? (If I make myself understood)
Still love me? (Will you treat me like you know you should?)
Still love me?
Still love me?
Still love me? (If I make myself understood)
Still love me? (Will you treat me like you know you should?)
Still love me?
Do you love me?
Still love me?
