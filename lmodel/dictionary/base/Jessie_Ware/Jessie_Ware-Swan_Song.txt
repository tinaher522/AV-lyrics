<song artist="Jessie_Ware" title="Swan_Song">
Lose yourself
In the glow
Rise and fall
Breath in slow
Left the sky
Painted all
Fall your eyes
Fall our souls (Fall our souls)
Hear my swan song
It was my mistake
Catch your kiss now, swan song
Help me to escape
(Escape)
You cast your spell
With stories told
Promises
Will they unfold?
Hear my swan song
It was my mistake
Catch your kiss now, swan song
Help me to escape
Eyes we'll hold (Eyes we'll hold)
Out the line (Out the line)
Let me go
It's alright
It's alright
Hear my swan song (Eyes we'll hold)
It was my mistake (Out the line)
Catch your kiss now, swan song (Hold)
Help me to escape
(Escape)
