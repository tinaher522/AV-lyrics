<song artist="Jessie_Ware" title="If_You're_Never_Gonna_Move">
"Carving my initials on your-"
"Carving my initials on your forehead"
"Carving my initials on your-"
"Carving my initials on your forehead"
Now, if you're never gonna move
Oh, my love
You'll make me come to you
But I'm still dancing on my own
Still dancing on my own
Although I'm coming close to you
Oh, my love
I'll keep the dance floor warm
But I'm still dancing on my own
Still dancing on my own
Won't dance, not without you
Small steps, they don't lead to your heart
You keep me wishing in the dark
What's wrong, you cannot lose
My eyes only see to your heart
You keep me wishing in the dark
"Carving my initials on your-"
"Carving my initials on your forehead"
Now, if you're never gonna move
Oh, my love
You'll make me come to you
But I'm still dancing on my own
Still dancing on my own
Although I'm coming close to you
Oh, my love
I'll keep the dance floor warm
But I'm still dancing on my own
Still dancing on my own
I know you hear me but can you reach me
Feel free to touch me and we can play hard
With body's jerking, but still I'm working
On you to move in and we can play hard
Now, if you're never gonna move
Oh, my love
You'll make me come to you
But I'm still dancing on my own
Still dancing on my own
Although I'm coming close to you
Oh, my love
I'll keep the dance floor warm
But I'm still dancing on my own
Still dancing on my own
We can play hard
"Carving my initials on your-"
Hard, hard
"Carving my initials on your forehead"
We can play hard, hard, hard
We can play hard, hard, hard
Hard, hard
"Carving my initials on your-"
Hard, hard
"Carving my initials on your forehead"
We can play hard, hard, hard
We can play hard
"Carving my initials on your-"
Hard, hard
"Carving my initials on your forehead"
Hard, hard
Now, if you're never gonna move
Oh, my love
You'll make me come to you
But I'm still dancing on my own
Still dancing on my own
Although I'm coming close to you
Oh, my love
I'll keep the dance floor warm
But I'm still dancing on my own
Still dancing on my own
Now, if you're never gonna move
Oh, my love
You'll make me come to you
But I'm still dancing on my own
Still dancing on my own
Although I'm coming close to you
Oh, my love
I'll keep the dance floor warm
But I'm still dancing on my own
Still dancing on my own
