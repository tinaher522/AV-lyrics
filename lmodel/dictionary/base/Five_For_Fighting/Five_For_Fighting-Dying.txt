<song artist="Five_For_Fighting" title="Dying">
I'm dying
Dying to wake up without you
Without you in my head again 
I'm dying
Dying to forget about you
That you ever lived 
There's a shade come over this
Heart that's coping with 
Laying down to rest 
I'm dying to live without you again 
I'm dying
Dying to find a distraction
Get you away from me 
I'm dying
Dying to reach a conclusion
So that the world can see 
It's the same old story of 
Love and glory that 
Broke before it bent 
I'm dying to live without you again 
The first time you left
I said goodbye 
Now there's not a prayer
That can survive 
Dying
Dying to die just to come back
So we can meet again 
Dying
Dying to say what I always
Always should have said 
It's a strange emotion this 
But there's still hope in this 
As long as there's a breath
I'm Dying and I can't live without you again 
It's a strange emotion this
But there's still hope in this 
As long as there's a breath
I'm dying and I can't live without you 
I'm dying and I can't live without you again
