<song artist="Five_For_Fighting" title="The_Riddle">
There was a man back in '95 
Whose heart ran out of summers 
But before he died, I asked him 
Wait, what's the sense in life 
Come over me, Come over me 
He said, 
Son why you got to sing that tune 
Catch a Dylan song or some eclipse of the moon 
Let an angel swing and make you swoon 
Then you will see... You will see 
Then he said, 
Here's a riddle for you 
Find the Answer 
There's a reason for the world 
You and I... 
Picked up my kid from school today 
Did you learn anything cause in the world today 
You can't live in a castle far away 
Now talk to me, come talk to me 
He said, 
Dad I'm big but we're smaller than small 
In the scheme of things, well we're nothing at all 
Still every mother's child sings a lonely song 
So play with me, come play with me 
And Hey Dad 
Here's a riddle for you 
Find the Answer 
There's a reason for the world 
You and I... 
I said, 
Son for all I've told you 
When you get right down to the 
Reason for the world... 
Who am I? 
There are secrets that we still have left to find 
There have been mysteries from the beginning of time 
There are answers we're not wise enough to see 
He said... You looking for a clue? I Love You free... 
The batter swings and the summer flies 
As I look into my angel's eyes 
A song plays on while the moon is hiding over me 
Something comes over me 
I guess we're big and I guess we're small 
If you think about it man you know we got it all 
Cause we're all we got on this bouncing ball 
And I love you free 
I love you freely 
Here's a riddle for you 
Find the Answer 
There's a reason for the world 
You and I...
