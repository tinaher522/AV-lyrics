<song artist="Five_For_Fighting" title="Love_Song">
Put away your tears and your sleepy eyes
Put away that bullshit, big boys they don't cry to their mommas
... she'll be back soon
Put away your raincoat and make your bed
Take another bullet right to your head
Now, we're going on a picnic and we'll get there soon
And she says... maybe it's over
He says... there's plenty more fish in the sea
I say... don't go away from me
Now put away your dinner and have a snack
Tie your little brother up in a sack now
We're moving to the country and we'll get there soon (she says)
Now, pack up all the things that you don't deserve
Take another swing... well here comes a curve ball
I bet you can't hit it cuz you'll swing to soon
And she says... maybe it's over
He says... there's plenty more fish in the sea
I say... don't go away...don't go away... 
Please don't go away, from me
But can you take it too hard?
I'll never leave
Take those damn pictures off of that shelf
Put away your mommy you don't need her
I found you a new one... she'll be here soon
And she says...my God it's over,
He says...I found another fish in the sea
I say... why me?
Why me?
Why me?
Why is it me?
