<song artist="Five_For_Fighting" title="Day_By_Day">
Day by day
I wake up for you I do
And I rise up to who knows who
And if I could say some other day
Day by day
I reach up to you I do
And I pretend there's something to it
And if I could say I've had better days
DooDooDooDooDoo repeat 3x
Day by day
I rise up to you I do
And I wash up after you're through
And if I could say that's O.K.
DooDooDooDooDoo repeat 3x
And you're in my head again
And you're in my bed again
And you're in my mirror again
Heeeeeeeeeeeeee
And if you don't me I don't mind you
DaDaDaDa
Day by day
I wake up to you I do I do I do
