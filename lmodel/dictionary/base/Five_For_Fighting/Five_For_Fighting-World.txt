<song artist="Five_For_Fighting" title="World">
Got a package full of wishes
A time machine, a magic wand
A globe made out of gold
No instructions or commandments
Laws of gravity or
Indecisions to uphold
Printed on the box I see
Acme's Build-a-world-to-be
Take a chance, grab a piece
Help me to believe it
What kind of world do you want?
Think anything
Let's start at the start
Build a masterpiece
Be careful what you wish for
History starts now
Should there be people or peoples
Money, funny pedestals for fools who never pay
Raise your army, choose your steeple
Don't be shy, the satellites can look the other way
Lose the earthquakes, keep the faults
Fill the oceans without the salt
Let every man own his own hand
What kind of world do you want?
Think anything
Let's start at the start
Build a masterpiece
Be careful what you wish for
History starts now
Sunlight's on the bridge
Sunlight's on the way
Tomorrow's calling
There's more to this than love
What kind of world do you want
What kind of world do you want
What kind of world do you want
Think anything
Let's start at the start
Build a masterpiece
History starts now
Be careful what you wish for
Start now
