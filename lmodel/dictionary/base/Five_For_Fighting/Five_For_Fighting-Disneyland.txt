<song artist="Five_For_Fighting" title="Disneyland">
I Woke up got my lazy ass out of bed 
I Watered all the rocks growing in my head 
I Had a thought...and fell asleep on you... 
There I was somewhere West of Tomorrow Land 
Flying through the stars just like Peter Pan 
I said...Damn this looks too good to be true... 
There she goes... my heart again (would you mind rolling over) 
I can feel it in the air (something's coming down) 
I don't know and I don't care that it's a small world 
It's a nice day if you wake up in Disneyland... 
It's a nice day when you wake up in Disneyland... 
In my dream everybody's got a little house 
A dog, a bank account managed by Mickey Mouse 
And the only thing we fight about is the Lakers... 
In my dream all the pirates down in Neverland 
Never get the Hook... they just get a hand 
While the crocs sing Superman till we just can't take it... 
There she goes... my heart again (do you mind rolling over) 
I can feel it in the air (something's coming down) 
I don't know and I don't care if it's a small world 
It's a nice day when you wake up in Disneyland... 
It's a nice day if you wake up in Disneyland... 
We can fly away... 
I Woke up got my lazy ass out of bed 
I Watered all the rocks growing in my head 
I Had a thought... and I looked up to see 
The sign read the park she's closed today 
E-tickets don't work here no more anyway 
Where every day's a magic day to be free You see... 
It's a nice day when you wake up in Disneyland... 
It's a nice day should you wake up in Disneyland... 
It's your L.U.C.K.Y. day should you wake up in Disneyland... 
It's a nice day should you wake up in Disneyland...
