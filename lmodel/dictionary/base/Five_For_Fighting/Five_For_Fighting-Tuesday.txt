<song artist="Five_For_Fighting" title="Tuesday">
One year like any old other year
In a week like any week
Monday lying down
Half Asleep
People doing what people do
Loving, working and getting through
No portraits on the walls
Of Seventh Avenue
Then Tuesday came and went
Like a helicopter overhead
The Letter that she left
Cold Addressed in Red
Tuesday Came and went one
One September
When will she come again
The thing about memories
They're sure and bound to fade
Except for the stolen souls
Left upon her blade
Is Monday coming back 
That's what Mondays do
They Turn and Turn around
Afraid to see it through
Tuesday came and went
Like a helicopter overhead
The Letter that she left
Cold Addressed in Red
Tuesday Came and went one
One September
When will she come again
Tuesday Came and went one
One September, When? 
Cold and dressed in red
How could I forget
Tuesday Came and went
Like a Helicopter overhead
Will she come again
