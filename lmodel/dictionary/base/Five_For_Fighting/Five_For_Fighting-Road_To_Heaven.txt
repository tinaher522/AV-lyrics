<song artist="Five_For_Fighting" title="Road_To_Heaven">
Sometimes I think about silly things
It's easy to do if you have the time
Often happens when I'm falling off to sleep 
After a second glass of wine
The clock is usually running out
Down by one or could be tied
I'm fading back
Winding up
The championship on the line...but...
What if there was a road to heaven
That's what came to me today
Would there be Traffic jams with diamond lanes 
Potholes filled up with rain
Would there be Tolls still left to pay 
If there was a road to heaven
Made of gold or made out of clay
Would the Angels wave me up the hill
Or in my mirror just fade away
I've never been the kind a man who hits his knees
Got no answers for big questions
I don't know...
Maybe tomorrow lightning will hit me on the head
And we can find out if we're just a joke
Jesus I'm told can build a bridge
Finer than any other man
There's a certain peace to an country road
With a wheel in your hand
If there was a road to heaven
Would there be laws I must obey
If I drove my mustang 85
Late one night turned out the lights
Would the stars still light the way
If there was a road to heaven
Made of Gold or Made of Clay 
Would the Angels lead me up the hill
Or in my mirror just fade away
Night turns morning
The old man should be snoring
I got to get some sleep before I'm awake
Up with the monkeys
I sure love the monkeys
But This job ain't all cookies and cake
Sometimes I think about silly things
It's easy to do if you got the wine
In The Eagle we're landing 
I'm the President
Or a foreign king
With a harem from Encino to Brunei
But if there was a road to heaven 
It'd be one long and crazy ride...
If there was a road to heaven babe
That's a road that I'd like to find.
