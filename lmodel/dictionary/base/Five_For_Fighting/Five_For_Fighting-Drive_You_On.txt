<song artist="Five_For_Fighting" title="Drive_You_On">
Jackie was a lamb but she never gave a damn 
Now stand up 
Caught up in the ring, she fell into a sting 
Now stand up 
Look into her face, you will see yourself 
If you really think about it, she's anybody else 
Now, life 
Keep it simple, lover 
I'll meet you under cover 
I'll meet you anywhere that you wanna go 
My sweet one 
With you it's like no other 
Every sister and their brother 
Knows that love will drive you on 
Danny was a good man, running from the sandman 
Stand up 
Flew into an airplane, looking for a new train 
Stand up 
He never had a chance under her romance 
The ladies all cried, but he smiled when he died 
Now, life 
Keep it simple, lover 
I'll meet you under cover 
I'll meet you anywhere that you wanna go 
My sweet one 
With you it's like no other 
Every sister and their brother 
Knows that love will drive you on 
I'm waitin' on a midnight fantasy 
I'm gonna find my little bit of piece of me (please) 
Why you gotta stay so, why you gotta stay so far from me 
Oh oh, oh oh 
Life 
Keep it simple, lover 
I'll meet you under cover 
I'll meet you anywhere you wanna go 
My sweet one 
With you it's like no other 
Every sister and their brother 
Knows that love will drive you on 
Life 
Keep it simple, lover 
I'll meet you under cover 
I'll meet you anywhere that you wanna go 
You're my sweet one 
With you it's like no other 
Every sister and their brother 
Knows that love will drive you on
