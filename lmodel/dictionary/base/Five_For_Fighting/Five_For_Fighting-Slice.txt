<song artist="Five_For_Fighting" title="Slice">
There was a time a long, long time ago
Chevys and levees played on the radio
No cell phones
Just 20,000 lights
Swaying on a Saturday night alright
Can you imagine that slice of time
Rock n roll was young
People stood in line
To hear music that played into their lives
That you could carry till the day you die
Hey Man Sing me a song
When we were everyone
We were more than just a Slice of American Pie
Have you read my blog today
300 million little USA's
Your doorstep is just a click away
We'll get together one of these days
How can you be as nice as me
You're not from the same slice as me
Where do we go from here my friend
Is this the way our story ends
Hey Man Sing me a song
When we were everyone
We were more than just a Slice of American Pie
I can't stop singing along
Can you join in... Come on
Are we more than just a Slice of American Pie
We're top down lovers
It's Saturday night
The Band's running
And it feels so right
The moon's dancing
And the stars are free
I caught your heart on a Summer breeze
Whatever was or what's meant to be
Our Melodies are Memories
There was a time a long, long time ago
Chevys and levees played on the radio
No cell phones 
Just 20,000 lights
Swaying on a Saturday night alright
Hey Man Sing me a song
When we were everyone
We were more than just a Slice of American Pie
I can't stop singing along
Can you join in, come on
Are we more than just a Slice of American Pie
We're more than a Slice
We're more than a Slice
We're more than just a Slice of American Pie
