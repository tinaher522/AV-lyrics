<song artist="Five_For_Fighting" title="Augie_Nieto">
Augie Nieto's got a story to tell you
Though it's hard to hear him speak
He caught Lou Gehrig rounding third one day
Now he's happy as he'll ever be
He's running through the night
He'll die before he sleeps
Augie's found what I've been looking for
Augie Nieto can tell you he loves you
He's two wheels close to God
His captain Lynn sailing by his side
He'll never leave you lost
Though his arms can't squeeze you tight
He'll hold you when you sleep
Augie's found what I've been looking for
Hey yeah, Hey yeah
Take it any way it goes
Hey yeah, Hey yeah
Open up your never mind
Open up your mind
Augie Nieto has never been happier
You got to see to believe
He caught Lou Gehrig rounding third one day
Now he's carrying the whole team
It's not the breaths you take
It's how to breathe
Augie's found what I've been looking for
Augie's found what I've been looking for
