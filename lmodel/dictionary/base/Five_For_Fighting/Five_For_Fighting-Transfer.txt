<song artist="Five_For_Fighting" title="Transfer">
Bought a ticket
Destination Nowhere
I am going
Then he smiled
It'd been awhile
He said
Goodbye bye bye bye love
She worked at the Transfer station
No last words or consolations
Why, I never lied
She cried
Goodbye bye bye bye love
He then took her off
He checked his line
The years went by
He found himself best he could find
Then a letter
Posted nowhere
Regards I've arrived
Am doing fine
I missed you mine
Come save my life
My love, my life
She then put him on
She checked her line
She took her time
And on her heart she relied
Bought a ticket
Destination Nowhere
I am going
Then she smiled
It'd been awhile
That smile
Goodbye bye bye bye love
Train pulls into nowhere
There he stands
A field of flowers
For his hands
My love he cries
I missed you mine
Come save my life
She says don't cry
Was only time
Moves in a line
And then she smiled
And said besides
I'm just passing bye
Bye bye bye bye love
Bye bye bye bye love
Bye bye bye bye love
Goodbye
