<song artist="Five_For_Fighting" title="Something_About_You">
I don't know where to begin
I don't know how to get out there to see you
I don't know where to dig in
I don't how to get in there...to feel you
It's been too long and I'm about to be in time for me
It's been too long and I'm in time
Baby there's something about you that
I can hold on to
I'm going to hold on to that
Baby there's something about you that
I can hold on to
I'm going to hold on to that
I never thought I would win
I never thought much about that
(It's been a long time coming)
I never stopped to begin
Thinking about the process
(It's been a long time coming)
It's been too long and I'm about to be in time for me
It's been too long and I'm in time
Baby there's something about you that
I can hold on to
I'm going to hold on to that
Baby there's something about you that
I can hold on to
I'm going to hold that
And I'm going to be there.... be there...... alright
I don't know where to begin
I don't know how to get out there to see you
Baby there's something about you that
I can hold on to
I'm going to hold on to that
Baby there's something about you that
I can hold on to
I'm going to hold on to that
It's been a long time coming
I'm going to hold on to that
