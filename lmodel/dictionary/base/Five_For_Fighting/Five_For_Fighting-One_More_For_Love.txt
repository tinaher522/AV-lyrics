<song artist="Five_For_Fighting" title="One_More_For_Love">
Baby there's something on my mind tonight
There's a reason to believe we almost got it right
There's a fire burning in the firelight
As we roll on tonight
There's paper promises and alibis
There is certainly uncertainty in all our eyes
But as long as you are here I'll be all right
As we roll on tonight
So you go out... I'll go on
If there's a doubt... Well, we'll be strong
As we go on singing
One more for love, my love
One more for love
There's always blood to fill the heart betrayed
There are children being born to every house that's raised
And we're getting closer to where we got it made
As we roll on tonight
So you go out... I'll go on
If there's a doubt... Well, we'll be strong
As we go on singin'
One more for love, my love
One more for love
Singin' one more for love, my love
One more for love
I'm never going to wait for anything
Never going to break for anything
Cause I am...
One more for love, my love
One more for love
One more for love my love
Baby there's something on my mind tonight
There's a reason to believe that we got it right
And all and all you're all that's on my mind tonight
As we roll on...
One more for love, my love
One more for love
