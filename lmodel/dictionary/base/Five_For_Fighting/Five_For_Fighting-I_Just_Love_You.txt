<song artist="Five_For_Fighting" title="I_Just_Love_You">
Lonely, yeah that's the word
I leave my heart when I leave her 
The days go on forever and the nights do too 
One evening out on the road
A half a world away from home
I thought she was sleeping
When the call came through
I said, Darling, it's late, is everything ok
Silence took over the room
Til she said
I... I just Love You
I Don't Know Why, I Just Do 
When are you coming home
I'm coming home soon
And I just love you too
Lonely lets me be
For a while she sets me free
I close my eyes and I dream of her
She's lost in my arms
Her head on my heart
And softly she whispers the words
I...I just Love You 
I Don't Know Why, I Just Do 
When are you coming home
I'm coming home soon
And I just love you too
I'll never stop being amazed
How my 4-year old girl knows exactly what to say
I, I just Love You 
I Don't Know Why, I Just Do 
When are you coming home
I'm coming home soon
Cause I just love you too
