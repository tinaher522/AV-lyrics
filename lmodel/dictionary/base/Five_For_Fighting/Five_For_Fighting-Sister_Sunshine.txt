<song artist="Five_For_Fighting" title="Sister_Sunshine">
I traded my smile for a pain pill
I needed a place maybe I could feel better
But all the while I could never get you out of my mind	
I had a child with the universe
I'll never understand why the good man's cursed
If you're gonna have a heart then you've gotta be the one to die
Hey, hey, Sister Sunshine
You been living in the sky
Are you ever gonna come on down?
Hey, hey, Sister Sunshine
Show me love
I prayed, though I've never been a God man
You never know, maybe it just might mean something
I switched back; see if anything was going right
The washer called me a bloody "F"
Said, "You're gonna save one? Better save yourself.
And you'll never know me 'til you find your own piece of life."
Hey, hey, Sister Sunshine
You been living in the sky
Are you ever gonna come on down?
Brother, can you help me?
Hey, hey, Sister Sunshine
Show me love, love, love
Gonna show me love, love, love, love
And if you fly away
I won't let you fly away
There's that and nothing more
There's that and only that
Nothing more
Hey, hey, Sister Sunshine
You been living in the sky
Are you ever gonna come on down?
Now, Brother, can you help me?
Hey, hey, Sister Sunshine
You been living in the sky
Are you ever gonna come on down?
Hey, hey, Sister Sunshine
You been living in the sky
Are you ever gonna come on down?
No one's ever gonna help me
Hey, hey, Sister Sunshine
You been living in the sky
Are you ever gonna come on down?
Hey, hey, Sister Sunshine
