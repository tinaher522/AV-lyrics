<song artist="Five_For_Fighting" title="Road_To_You">
I can't believe how I love you
You'll be the last
You'll be the last turn I take
All of the signs are in color
Baby, I'm on my way
I hear a song on the radio
And it sounds like something I miss
But, I don't need those old melodies
With you on my lips
I was born a fool on the run
I've broken hearts and lost at love
There's not one thing I would change or undo
Cause all my life's been a road to you
Watching you walk down the aisle
Every step, every step takes a year
Baby, you can count on the man
That's standing right here
Today is the way to forever
I made a map to find you when you're alone
Wherever we've been don't matter
We're this close to home
I was born a fool on the run
I've broken hearts and lost at love
There's not one thing I would change or undo
Cause all my life's been a road to you
Road to you
Road to you
I was born a fool on the run
I've broken hearts and lost at love
There's not one thing I would change or undo
Cause all my life's been a road to you
I was born a fool on the run
I've broken hearts and lost at love
There's not one thing I would change or undo
Cause all my life's been a road to you
