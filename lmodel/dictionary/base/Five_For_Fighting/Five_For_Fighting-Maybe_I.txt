<song artist="Five_For_Fighting" title="Maybe_I">
You were right 
You came over me 
What'd never been before 
You slid under my door, and now I find 
A Reason to admit I've been too lazy 
But in this light 
In this atmosphere 
I'm starting to believe 
The other side of me but who's to know 
Honey... surely one of us is crazy 
(Maybe I) Maybe I... I'm not so easily stung 
(Maybe I) Maybe I... I got some love for someone 
(Maybe I) Maybe I... I'm not the story for you 
(Maybe I) Maybe I... I'll be the do you ought to do 
So now I stand 
I never stood before 
What's better left unsaid is done, buried and dead and you're alive 
Girl I think you might just stay the night 
(Maybe I) Maybe I... I'm not so easily stung 
(Maybe I) Maybe I... I got some love for someone 
(Maybe I) Maybe I... I'll write a story for you 
(Maybe I) Maybe I... I'll be the do you ought to do 
I'm not trying to take it easy 
I'm not trying to help you see 
I'm not trying to take us over 
I'm just trying to believe 
Maybe I...
Maybe I...
Maybe I...
Maybe I...
(Maybe I) Maybe I... I'm not so easily stung 
(Maybe I) Maybe I... I got some love for someone 
(Maybe I) Maybe I... I'm just the story for you 
(Maybe I) Maybe I... I'll be the do you ought to do 
(Maybe I) Maybe I... I'm not the one for your love 
(Maybe I) Maybe I... I'll be your heaven above 
(Maybe I) Maybe I... I'll write a story for two 
(Maybe I) Maybe I... I'll be the do that you do
