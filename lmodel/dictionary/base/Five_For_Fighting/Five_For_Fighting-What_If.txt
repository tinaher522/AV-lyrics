<song artist="Five_For_Fighting" title="What_If">
Threw a line out to pull you to me
If you don't get it, then you don't get it
You made your mind up before you knew me
If you don't get it, then you don't get it
Take my hand for a minute.
We're in it - imagine all the pain that might be forgiven
What if I had your heart?
What if you wore my scars?
How would we break down?
What if you were me and what if I were you?
What if you told my lies?
What if I cried with your eyes?
Could anyone keep us down?
What if you were me? What if I were you?
Had a dream of a new tomorrow.
If you don't get it, then you don't get it.
I took a step hoping you might follow.
If you don't get it, then you don't get it.
Take a chance for a minute. Jump in it.
Imagine if you asked yourself for a minute:
What if I had your heart?
What if you wore my scars?
How would we break down?
What if you were me and what if I were you?
What if you told my lies?
What if I cried with your eyes?
Could anyone keep us down?
What if you were me? And what if I were you?
To the ones who make it better, find to get out, gotta touch the other side.
What if all that it took to save our lives together was to rise up?
(Hey!)
What if I had your heart?
What if you wore my scars?
How would we break down (break down)?
And what if I were you?
What if I told your lies?
What if you cried with my eyes?
Could anyone keep us down?
What if you were me? What if I were you?
What if your hand was my hand?
Could you hold on or let go?
What if your life was my life?
Can you love what we don't know?
What if your hand was my hand?
Could we hold on or let go?
What if your life was my life?
And what if I were you?
