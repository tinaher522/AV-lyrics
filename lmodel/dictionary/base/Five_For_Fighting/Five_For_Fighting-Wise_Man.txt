<song artist="Five_For_Fighting" title="Wise_Man">
(Number eight, we're rolling. One, two, three.)
You talk about one
You talk about reason and the nature of unity
You talk about rust
Good voice of freedom through your light of diversity
You are news confusion
I can feel
I can feel
I can feel
Wise man do you believe in love?
Wise man do you believe in the things that I'm thinking of?
Yeah! Woo!
So talk about truth
Talk about justice in the world of impurity
Talk about wars oooh
And the glory as a kingdom would rule
Ahhh kings, yeah!
See some dissolution
I can feel
I can feel
I can feel
Wise man do you believe in love?
Wise man are you sure of the power from above?
Wise man who do you see in me?
Me, yeah...
Ooooh
Wise man do you believe in love?
Wise man can you show me the power from above?
Wise man who do you see in me?
In me, yeah...
Talk about one
Talk about one
Talk about one
Talk about one
Talk about one
Talk about one
