Over by the still she says,
"Man I think you better wait for tomorrow
Take this pillow for your head
And I'll take you, yeah"
Back against the beast I went
To feel her coming, hot for the follow up
Here comes the sun again
To see me through, yeah
On and on and on and on and on and on and on
She takes me from you, my love
On and on and on and on and on and on and on
She rakes me from you
Happily I leave her fed
Tonight I swear, I swear on tomorrow, wait
Here comes the sun again
To see me through
On and on and on and on and on and on and on
She takes me from you, my love
On and on and on and on and on and on and on
She rakes me from you
Bloody Mary's for all
Bloody Mary's for all
On and on and on and on and on and on and on
She takes me from you, my love
On and on and on and on and on and on and on
She rakes me from you
All of my dreams, all of my dreams for you to follow, yeah
All of my dreams, all of my dreams for you to swallow, yeah
All of my dreams, all of my dreams for you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
