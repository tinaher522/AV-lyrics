<song artist="Five_For_Fighting" title="Your_Man">
Let me be clear
Look in my eyes
Don't ask me why
They've gone from brown to blue
Let yourself in
Don't be surprised
In what you find
All that you see is true
I don't want to have a horse in the running
I don't want to spread the news of the storm that is a coming
I don't want to be a saint on your shoulder
I don't want to be young
Be another day older
I don't want to be the son of a better man
I don't want to love you any more than the best I can
I just want to be your man
Old fairy tales built up on lies
Meant to disguise what we have left to lose
Turn me to stone
Offer me twice
Into the fire
Into the fire I choose
I don't want to have a horse in the running
I don't want to spread the news of the storm that is a coming
I don't want to be a saint on your shoulder
I don't want to be young
Be another day older
I don't want to be the son of a better man
I don't want to love you any more than the best I can
I just want to be your man
Your man
Daddy was a fool when he walked out on the wire
Waited for the wind, the wind was on fire
She took him at his word and they never turned back
Never turned back again
I don't want to be a saint on your shoulder
I don't want to be young
Another day older
I don't want to be the son of a better man
I don't want to love you any more than the best I can
I just want, I want, I want to be your man (I wanna be your man)
I don't want to be a horse in the running
But I could spread the news, a new day is coming
All I need to find is the place on your shoulder
Baby we could grow young, yeah we could grow older
We could have a son who's a better man
With baby blues eyes
Don't you understand
I just want to be your man
