<song artist="Five_For_Fighting" title="Easy_Tonight">
You were wrong
You were right
And you are gone
Tonight
You were free
So alive
You were wrong
You were right
And you were down
You could see
And you wore hearts
For me
And you were sharp
Sharp as knives
You were wrong
You were right
Shot down, said you never had the chance
Took a ride on a suicide romance
Could have sworn there was somebody home
To facilitate the great unknown
Oh woman, I ain't going to meet you anywhere
Don't know where I'm going yet,
But I sure am getting there
Shotgun fire, anybody home?
I got two dimes in the telephone
Alright? 
No, It's not easy tonight
Shotgun fire, anybody home?
I got two dimes in the telephone
Alright? 
No, It's not easy tonight
You were bound
You were free
You wear black
For me
You were dark
As dark as night
You were wrong
Yet you were right
Shot down, said you never had the chance
Took a ride on a suicide romance
Could have sworn there was somebody home
To facilitate the great unknown
Oh woman, I ain't going to meet you anywhere
Don't know where I'm going yet, no
But I sure am getting there
Shotgun fire, anybody home?
I got two dimes in the telephone
Alright? 
No, It's not easy tonight
Shotgun fire, anybody home?
I got two dimes in the telephone
Alright? 
No, It's not easy tonight
She's in over my head
And it's not easy, it's not easy tonight
She's in over my head
And it's not easy, it's not easy tonight
Shotgun fire, anybody home?
I got two dimes in the telephone
Alright?
No it's not easy tonight
Shotgun fire, anybody home?
I got two dimes in the telephone
Alright? 
No it's not easy tonight
You were free
Now your not
You were free babe
