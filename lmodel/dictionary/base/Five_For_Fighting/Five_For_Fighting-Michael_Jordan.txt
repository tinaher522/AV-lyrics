<song artist="Five_For_Fighting" title="Michael_Jordan">
My shirt, my hat, my books
A trip to the zoo
My couch, remote, a large coke yea
I'd get on my knees, my God,
If I could
I would give anything
I would give anything
I would give anything
I would give anything
I would give to be you...
My job, my car, my cash
My house on the hill
My piano, I'd burn to ashes (yea)
I'd get on my knees, my God,
If I could
I would give anything
I would give anything
I would give anything
I would give anything
I would give to be you...
My voice, my worm, my wife
A first born or two
I'd give the knife, my Mike if just,
Cut me at the knees
My God (My Jordan)
I would give anything
I would give anything
I would give anything
I would give anything
I would give anything
I would give anything
I would give anything
I would give anything
I would give to be you...
Whoo hoo...
Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah...
