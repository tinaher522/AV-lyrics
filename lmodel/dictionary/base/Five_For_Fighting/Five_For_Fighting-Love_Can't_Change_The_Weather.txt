<song artist="Five_For_Fighting" title="Love_Can't_Change_The_Weather">
Love comes in, Love goes out
Moves in circles, Roundabout
We've been tired;
We can't take it anymore
Love can't change the weather
She says I'm out of my mind, over my head
Love can't change the weather
But I'll rise to shade the sun when it blinds your eyes
Love is born, Love is dead
Runs in colours, Blues and reds
We can't die;
We can't waste it anymore
Love in me, Loving you
Makes it better, when love is true
We are one;
We can face any storm
Love can't change the weather
She says I'm out of my mind, over my head
Love can't change the weather
But I'll be holding you when the rain walks in
Holding on...
And if you're wondering;
What is my take on this
If you're wondering
I'm out of my mind, over my head
But I'll shade the sun if it blinds your eyes
Love can't change the weather
But I stand holding your heart, Keeping your hand
Love can't change the weather
I believe no act of God is stronger than you and me
Love comes in, Love goes out
We can't die...
