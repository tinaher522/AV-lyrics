<song artist="Five_For_Fighting" title="Freedom_Never_Cries">
I took a flag to a pawn shop 
For a broken guitar 
I took a flag to a pawn shop 
How much is that guitar 
I took a flag to a pawn shop 
I got me that guitar 
What's a flag in a pawn shop to me? 
I saw a man on the TV 
In a mask with a gun 
A man on the TV 
He had a ten-year old son 
I Saw a man on the TV 
His son had a gun 
And he says that he's coming for me 
I never loved the soldier until there was a war 
Or thought about tomorrow 
'til my baby hit the floor 
I only talk to God when somebody's about to die 
I Never cherished Freedom 
Freedom never cries. 
I wrote a song for a dead man 
To settle my soul 
A song for a dead man 
Now I'll never grow old 
I wrote a song for a dead man 
Now I'm out in the cold 
What's a song to a dead man to me? 
I never loved the soldier until there was a war 
Or thought about tomorrow 
'til my baby hit the floor 
I Only talk to God when somebody's about to die 
I Never cherished Freedom
Freedom never cries...
You can cry for her 
Die for her 
Lay down your life for her 
Kiss and wave Goodbye to her 
Anything at all 
You can cry for her 
Die for her
Make up your mind to her 
Anything at all 
There's a baby on the doorstep 
Wailing away 
There's a baby on the doorstep 
Longing for the day 
There's a baby on the doorstep 
Who'd give his life to take 
A flag to a pawn shop 
A flag to a pawn shop 
May he forget why he is crying some day
