<song artist="Five_For_Fighting" title="Ocean">
Okay, I got a thing for fish with no eyes
Who swim deep in the sea
With nothing to see
Okay, I got a thing for mountains of sand
Left all to their own
To quietly stand, won't you help me now
Take me to the bottom of...
Take me to the bottom of...
Take me to the bottom of... the ocean
Okay, I got a thing for mermaiden tails
Who swim naked with me
Your hair of seaweed
Okay, I got a thing for sunken shipwrecks
With booty of gold
I dont care if it's wet, won't you help me now 
Take me to the bottom of...
Take me to the bottom of...
Take me to the bottom of... the ocean
I don't need no air...
