What is Courage
Is it Brave
What are Lions
I've only seen them in parades
How is love supposed to read
In a footnote of history
What's a tap on your shoulder
That you're afraid to look over
A soldier's down in a fire fight
No one can look me in the eye
This is what it means to be alone.
Tear out my Heart
Feed it to Lions
For this one wish I beg you this tonight
Show me no mercy
But spare me my pride
I'm going for a drive
And if you find out he's coming home
When I come around the corner
I'll know that it's alright
Just leave me two lights
He was young just 23
Didn't have to go
But it was the man he wanted to be
Like every son he was an only one
One day he came to me, said
Freedoms nothing to look over
Till each man can stand upon its shoulder
I'll write you mountains of letters
Each one a little bit better
And know I'll never be alone
Tear out my Heart
Feed it to Lions
For this one wish I beg you this tonight
Show me no mercy
But spare me my pride
I'm going for a drive
And if you find out he's coming home
When I come around the corner
I'll know that it's alright
Leave me two lights
Silent Angels
Light the road up ahead
As the sentries guard the way
On the avenue of borrowed time
I'm almost home
The sun's to rise
I got to know
I've been driving all the night
There's our corner up ahead
I'm alive and I am dead
I drive right through the stop sign
I turn my head
As I lift my eyes
My eyes burn
Tear out my Heart
Feed it to Lions
For this one wish I beg you this tonight
Show me no mercy
Spare me my pride
I'm going for a drive
