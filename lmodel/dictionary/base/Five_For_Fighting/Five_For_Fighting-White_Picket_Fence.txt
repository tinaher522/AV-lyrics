<song artist="Five_For_Fighting" title="White_Picket_Fence">
I cut off the curls,
I shaved half my face,
Became half the man you asked to replace.
I'm willing to save you,
You said you're worth saving.
But half of my appetite's lost half it's craving.
Stand in the mirror,
Well that's me beside you.
The one with the smile,
The one that abides you.
Now don't mind the mad man, the killer, the lover.
Well he's slowly fading one into the other.
And where is that white picket fence,
That I painted myself,
In the late days of April.
Oh where are the daffodil mountains,
I know that they're somewhere around here,
By the garden....
You say that you're happy,
Well you should know better.
I can see that you've sewn up that rip in your sweater,
That some lover tore off you.
That left you both shaken.
That bled deep inside you, the wound you'd forsaken.
And where is that white picket fence,
That I painted myself,
In the late days of April.
Oh where are the daffodil mountains,
I know that they're somewhere around here,
By the garden....
Don't fear I will save you.
Don't shout you'll awaken.
The corpse in the desert,
staked out beside you.
I cut off his wing,
And shaved half his face,
but I thought that I saw his eyes -- move.
