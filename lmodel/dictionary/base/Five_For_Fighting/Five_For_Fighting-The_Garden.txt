<song artist="Five_For_Fighting" title="The_Garden">
Do you believe in the man in the garden
Do you believe that he was there
Do you believe in the man in the garden
Do you believe or do you care 
Did he rise from the ashes and lead the sky above
Did he lie in the name of love 
....in the garden 
Do you believe in the path that you follow
Do you believe it takes you where you want
Do you believe in the lies that you swallow
Do you believe it takes you where you go 
See the man. He never lies he never will
Did he fight for the right to kill 
....in the garden
....in the garden 
There's a little man in a house alone...waiting
He doesn't lie.
He doesn't wait for love to hold on to
He doesn't lie. He doesn't wait... 
Johnny's in the garden
I see the err in my ways 
....in the garden 
Do you believe in the man in the garden?
