<song artist="Five_For_Fighting" title="Jupiter_Moon">
Seems we're all looking for to find
All the little thing that we've left behind
Now, we may seek, we may find
Well, I just read between the lines
To be my Jupiter's moon
Won't you come around soon?
And I love you from the cradle to the grave
The cradle to the grave
We were searching far a wide
For some of those things that we put aside
Now, we may seek, we may find
Well, I just read between the lines
To be my Jupiter's moon
Won't you come around soon?
And I love you from the cradle to the grave
Be my Jupiter's moon
Won't you come around soon?
Protect you as you move along the way
She got everything to live for
With a brave
So don't despair this heart, ooh
Stop it now before it starts
Be my Jupiter's moon
Won't you come around soon?
And I love you from the cradle to the grave
Be my Jupiter's moon
Won't you come around soon?
Protect you as you move along the way
Protect you as you move along the way
And I love you from the cradle to the grave
The cradle to the grave
The cradle to the grave
The cradle to the grave
Jupiter's moon
Come around soon
Jupiter's moon
Jupiter's moon
