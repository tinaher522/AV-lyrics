<song artist="Five_For_Fighting" title="This_Dance">
This is not our favorite song
but the night is moving right along
may I have your hand, may I have this dance.
I sense that you are amused,
but you just bought those brand new shoes.
It would such a shame not to give us the chance.
And oh my love there is only so
many dances we can take across
the night.
So while is just me and you
I thought I might say to you
You put the beautiful in life.
I know at times that you feel alone
when I'm here and I'm never home.
You said before is the price that you pay.
On matters of clarity
is not secret you are carrying me.
But you disguise thoughts of fall
I will keep you safe.
And oh my love there is only so
many dances we can take across
the night.
So while is just me and you
I thought I might say to you
You put the beautiful in life.
And oh....
oh...oh...
This is not our favorite song
but I wish it go on and on
it's moments like these
singers do all they can to stop time.
So let me just say to you
before the DJ changes the tune
you put the beautiful in life
you put the beautiful in life.
