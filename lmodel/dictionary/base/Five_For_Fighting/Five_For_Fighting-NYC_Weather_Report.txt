<song artist="Five_For_Fighting" title="NYC_Weather_Report">
Got to get away from here...
Got to get away from all these thinkers...drinking up my thoughts again
Got to get away from here...
Got to get away from all these choosers, losers...all my best of friends
Sit back New York city
You're not cute but you're oh so pretty
When the rain comes you fall up again...
SUNNY....You are a part of me
SUNNY....You are the heart of me
Got to get away from here...
Got to get away from all these people who need people...You know it really makes me sick
Got to get away from here...
Got to get away from expectations, recreations, just for the sake of it
Sit back New York City
You're not cute but you're oh so pretty 
When the rain comes you fall up again...
SUNNY....you are a part of me
SUNNY....You are the heart of me
Hey yeah yeah yeah
Hey yeah yeah yeah
Sit back New York City
You're not cute but you're oh so pretty
When the rain falls you come up again...
Sit back New York City friend...
Got to get away from here...
Got to get away from what I'm thinking...I'm thinking...it's too much for anyone
Got to get away from here...
Got get away from what you're drinking...you're drinking...so I'll take another one
