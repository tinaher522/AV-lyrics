<song artist="Five_For_Fighting" title="Hope">
When life's got you down and
you can't make a sound
Cause love has forsaken you
When you burning on fire
but have no desire
To put out the flames in
You gotta have hope
You gotta have something
there's always a reason to break Hope
Cause nothing less
Will save the day
When you are in pain then
step of the train
Nobody's waiting for you
You can knock down each
door of all metaphors
Or embrace the cold hard truth
But you gotta have hope
You gotta have something
there's always a reason to break Hope
Cause nothing less
Will save the day
I see that look in your eyes
I've seen it before
Each to our own disguise
If you need me babe
you're not alone, no, no
When life's got you down and
you can't make a sound
cause despair has stolen your song
but raise up your fist
and into the abyss
Scream, "Coward, get of my lawn"
Hope
Something
there's always a reason to break Hope
Cause nothing less will save the day
