<song artist="Five_For_Fighting" title="Angels_&_Girlfriends">
I met her down at a Pineapple Parking lot
She said I love you more, I said I love you not
And all the while I stood in line at the paint shop
She said I'll take you where you'll never go again
I'll be your only love; you'll be my only friend
And for your time I'll let you dine at my office
Angels never come for free
If you know what I know you know what I mean
You can love 'em now - you can love 'em later
Girlfriends never fall for fun
They can tie you up make you come undone
You can learn to fly - But you can't create her
She led me down through a forest of wooden chairs
As she ate my lunch I looked out for bears
And in a sense you could say she snared my attention
She said I am your perfect finality
And as I got her off she got off her knees
And for my grind I got honorable mention
Everybody needs one
Everybody's bound
Everybody swings upon the Marry-Go-Around
Girlfriends never fall for fun
They can tear you up make you come undone...
So now I'm stuck in this pineapple parking lot
I had what I was, now I'm what I got
And if I may, may I lend you some kind of direction?
If you go you may never come back again
She's my only love; she's my only friend
And for that there is no kind of protection
Everybody needs one
Everybody's bound
Everybody swings and meanwhile Mary Goes Around
Angels never come for free
If you know what I know, you know what I mean
First you hate to love and then you love to hate her
Girlfriends never fall alone
Now you know what I know; you know what I've known
I'll see you now, and I'll see you later
I'll see you later
I think I can save her
I wish I could date her
