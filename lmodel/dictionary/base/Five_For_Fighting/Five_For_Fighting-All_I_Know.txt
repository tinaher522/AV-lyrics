<song artist="Five_For_Fighting" title="All_I_Know">
I bruise you
You bruise me
We both bruise so easily
Too easily to let it show
I love you, and thats all I know
And all my plans
keep falling through
All my plans they
Depend on you
Depend on you
To help them grow
I love you
And thats all I know
When the singer's gone
Let the song go on
It's a fine line between
The darkness and the dawn
They say in the darkest night
Theres a light beyond
And the ending always
Comes at last
Endings always
Come too fast
They come too fast
And they pass too slow
I love you
And thats all, its really all I know
Its all I know
Its all I know
