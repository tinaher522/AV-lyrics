Bella played the bridge every second
loneliest night of the year.
Took a certain liking to a fellow there, Bella.
She said I brought her back to some old better man, fella.
Bella, she was born today feeling kinda spry.
Bella's birthday cake was burning, yeah
Like lightning, oh, like fire
Bella's birthday cake was burning
Bella made her bed in red 
every loneliest night of the year.
Tied me to rages of her rocking chair, Bella.
Fed me quiet offer through her ever wares, I tell ya
Bella she was born today feeling kinda spry.
Bella's birthday cake was burning yeah
like lightning, oh, like fire
Bella's birthday cake was burning
ever yearning forest fire.
And all of her lines she left unread
"Spirits and battles won," she said
And over her mountain tops 
she ground me off where...I can't remember...no
Bella played the bridge on the second
loneliest of the year
Bella she was born today
Bella, Bella, Bella, Bella, oh
Bella, Bella, Bella, Bella, oh
Bella, Bella, Bella, Bella, oh
Bella, Bella, Bella, Bella, oh
Bella's birthday cake was burning 
Bella's birthday cake was burning
Bella's birthday cake was burning
Bella's birthday cake was burning
Fifty years gone
Bella's birthday cake was burning
Fifty years gone
Fifty years man
Fifty years gone
Bella's birthday cake was burning, burning, burning
Bella, Bella, woo...
