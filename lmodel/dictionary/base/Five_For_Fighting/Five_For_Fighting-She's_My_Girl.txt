<song artist="Five_For_Fighting" title="She's_My_Girl">
She turns wine to water
She's nobody's daughter
A stranger to the lovers at her feet
She makes potions between kisses
And wishes on the sun
Because the stars late at night she can't see
She's my best friend
She's standing right beside me
I've waited my whole life
For somebody to find me
I know you don't like her
But she's my girl
She's better than ice cream
I know you know what I mean
Better than the real thing
She can make my heart scream
She's my girl
She's my girl
There's beauty in disaster
You can just ask her
But you wont like what you will hear
Her name has stitches between letters
Goes on forever
In a skyline rainbow made of tears
She's my best friend
She's standing right beside me
I've waited my whole life
For somebody to find me
I know you don't like her
But she's my girl
She's better than ice cream
I know you know what I mean
Better than the real thing
She can make my heart scream
She's my girl
She's my girl
We all need someone to love
Fire to touch
Reasons to rise above the cold
In a paralyzed world
It's not enough to pretend alone
She's my girl
She's better than ice cream
I know you know what I mean
Better than the real thing
She can make my heart scream
She's my girl
She's my best friend
She's standing right beside me
I've waited my whole life
For somebody to find me
I know you don't like her
But she's my girl
She's better than ice cream
I know you know what I mean
Better than the real thing
She can make my heart scream
She's my girl
She's my girl
She's my girl
