<song artist="Five_For_Fighting" title="Out_Of_Love">
I'm out of love again
And I need anyone
I'm out of love again
And I need everyone
I'm out. I'm in again
And I need some love
I'm out of touch again
And I need you babe
I'm out of love again
But I got your stuff
I'm out of love again
But I got your love
I'm out of wack again
And I need soft heat
I'm down to far to bend
And I need something sweet
I'm out of love again
But I got your stuff
I'm out of love again
But I got your love
I'm out love again
But I got your stuff
People in my life... you're the one
Of people in my life you're the one
I'm out of love again
But I got your love
I'm out of love again
But I got your stuff
I'm out of love again
But I got your love
(I got your love)
(I got your love)
(I got your love)
I'm out of love again
I'm out of love again
I'm out of love again
Not while you're by my side
