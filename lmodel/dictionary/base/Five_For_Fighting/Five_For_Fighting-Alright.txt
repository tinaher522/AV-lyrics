<song artist="Five_For_Fighting" title="Alright">
I took her leaving like I did before
I turned around and I asked for more
And she didn't even mean a thing to me
I left my spirit at the chapel door
I sailed around 'til I lost the war
And you didn't even think to send a thing
I'm alright, alright, I feel alright
I never been better in my life 
Yeah, you know the score
I'm just fine, I'm fine, feeling fine
A regular sawed-off valentine
Well, that nothing more
I hit my head upon the chamber door
And all the marbles rolled on the floor
And all the psychos in the ward start screaming, screaming, yeah yeah yeah
I'm alright, alright, I feel alright
I never been better in my life 
Yeah, you know the score
I'm just fine, I'm fine, feeling fine
A regular sawed-off valentine
Well, that nothing more
My baby
I'm alright, alright, I feel alright
I never been better in my life 
Yeah, you know the score
I'm just fine, I'm fine, feeling fine
A regular sawed-off valentine
Well, that nothing more
