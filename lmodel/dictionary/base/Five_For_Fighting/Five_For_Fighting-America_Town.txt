<song artist="Five_For_Fighting" title="America_Town">
I know I should be happy in your land
It's not all that wild to be me
Not that I want to be any other where
I know it's hell out there
Here in the borders of America Town
All of the dollies are spinning round and round and round
Hail to the chief
Let's just drag them all down
There's got to be a hero somewhere
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah
Used to get annoyed at the fire and the flag
Now it just seems old to me
Everyone is old to me
And I know, I know we'd kick your ass
But first I'll take a nap tonight
And know someone's looking over me
Here in the borders of America Town
All of the dollies are spinning round and round and round
Hail to the chief
Let's just drag them all down
There's got to be hero somewhere
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah
I tried it, I tried it
I've seen it and I bought it all
I tried it, I tried it
I've seen it and I bought it all
Yeah yeah yeah
Ooh, yeah yeah yeah
Not that I'm upset
I can still make my bet
on the basketball game
And I got my-my spare change
I'm even o.k. with the hoodlums on the hill
They're in my will
Like her and you
Whom and who
In America Town
We all spin around
In America Town
I'm really not down
We all spin around
In America Town
America Town
America Town, yeah
Here we go, here we go
In America Town
We all spin around
In America Town
Yeah yeah yeah
