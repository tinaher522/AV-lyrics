<song artist="Five_For_Fighting" title="Down">
Hey good looking
What you got cooking
I can see but I can't find the light
Please forgive me
If I don't have a smile to smile tonight
Don't you know
Life ain't pictures and words
And I don't care if you know that I'm hurting cause
I wont let you get me down
I wont let you get me down
This time around
I see you're happy
Out there laughing
Must be nice to have your sweet revenge
I might be crazy
But I think I won this in the end, the end
Don't you know I can build my own house
You can try, but you can't throw me out because
I wont let you get me down
I wont let you get me down
They say you don't get what you want
But you get what you need
I don't know who they are
Or how they believe it
The truths in the tears
The fire and the fears
I'm standing on
I wont let you get me down
I wont let you get me down
I wont let you get me down
I wont let you get me down
This time around
