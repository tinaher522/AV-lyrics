Hey Kid.. Your time has come to change
Though I need you more than I've needed anyone in any way tonight
Hey Kid..I know it won't be long
The Captain's calling come to see you back where you belong
Something inside me is breaking
Something inside says there's somewhere better than this
Sunset sailing on April skies
Bloodshot fire clouds in her eyes
I can't say what I might believe
But if God made you he's in love with me
Hey Kid..Do wishes count at all
Can you give me a sign..give me anything I won't tell a soul you told?
Hey Kid...Will you hold me when I sleep?
Will you find me when the tide decides that I got to leave?
Something inside me is breaking
Something inside says there's somewhere better than this
Sunset sailing on April skies
Bloodshot fire clouds in her eyes
I can't say what I might believe
But if God made you he's in love with me
Sunset sailing on April skies
Bloodshot fire clouds in your eyes
I can't say what I might believe 
But if God made you he's in love with me
Something inside me is breaking
Something inside me says there's somewhere better than this my love
Sunset sailing on April skies
Bloodshot fire clouds in her eyes
I can't say what I might believe
But if God made you he's in love with me
Sunset sailing on April skies
Bloodshot fire clouds in your eyes
I can't say what I might believe
But if God made you..
He's in love with me..
