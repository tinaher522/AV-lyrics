<song artist="Five_For_Fighting" title="Terrasong">
Another day is over
Another light is breaking and i'm tired
but i im wild about you my little woman 
i feel you in the water
i feel you in the corner of myself
hey who else babe knows you like i do?
as we go again with the stars and their friends
loving me come'on
as i hold on to you for all we've been thru
promises (promises) are just a part of it (are just a part of it) 
comon
for every sweet surrender another spark is woke by the sun 
no other one can shine like you do for me
i know i can be trying but every day is something to love
and i love every time i look at you
as we go again 'round the stars and their friends
loving me come'on
as i hold on to you for all we've been thru
promises (promises) are just a part of it (are just a part of it)
promises (promises) are just the start of it (are just the start of it)
promises (promises) are just a part of it (are just a part of it)
promises (promises) are just the start of it (are just the start of it)
promises (promises) are just a part of it (are just a part of it)
