<song artist="Five_For_Fighting" title="Above_The_Timberline">
I get a little tired looking through the trees
Sitting on the 405 hoping for a breeze
Everybody's gunning, they got something to see
I gotta sell this ticket, get the shadow off of me
So what is your problem? You've been moping around
You need to find a mountaintop and get out of this town
She says, sometimes, you gotta get away
Clear out that noggin, open up the day
Above the timberline
The higher I go, the harder I climb
I'm closer to you, it's clear in my mind
Love shines bright above the timberline
Now things get slower when it's harder to breathe
I can almost touch the stars that are hanging over me
You've never been more beautiful, and it's easy to see
All that really matters, you're all I'll ever need
I'm getting to the bottom at the top of the world
Leaving trivialities parked down at the curb
All that noise between us, now it can't be heard
I'm listening to the wind, I'm writing down the words
Above the timberline
The higher I go, the harder I climb
I'm closer to you, it's clear in my mind
Love shines bright above the timberline
Now I'll be coming home, I'll be coming home soon
Before I head on down I'm gonna kiss the moon
Above the timberline
The higher I go, the harder I climb
I'm closer to you, it's clear in my mind
Love shines bright above the timberline
Above the timberline
No hitting the brakes, no waiting in line
The farther you go, the higher you'll climb
Love shines bright above the timberline
