<song artist="Five_For_Fighting" title="Boat_Parade">
There's a crack in the hull
Where the penitents used to live
There's a crack in the hull
Where the penitents used to live
And we can make it right if we row all night
Give all that we can give
There's a crack in the hull
Where the penitents used to live
There's a leak in the hold
Where the infantry used to sleep
There's a leak in the hold
Where the infantry used to sleep
And we can make it right if we roll all night
Baby dust off your knees
There's a leak in the hold
Where the infantry used to be
Little monsters (on the table)
Crazies here to play
Little monsters on the boat parade
There's a hole in the hat
Where the captian kept his dreams
There's a hole in the hat
Where the captian kept his dreams
And we can make it right
If we sail all night
Better pray for a breeze
There's a hole in the hat
Where the captian used to be
