<song artist="Peter_Cetera" title="Practical_Man">
I've always been known as a practical man
Certainly one-of-a-kind
Then you came along with the wave of your hand
And suddenly young love is blind
I'll build you a house by the water
It's always been your fantasy 
Then I'll settle down for the rest of my life
Now that you're livin' with me, oh,
Now that you're livin' with me 
I've always been known as the kind of a guy
Who runs off to hide from a dream
But you've got that good one I've never tried
And nothing's as hard as it seems
I'll build you a house by the mountains
It's always been your fantasy
Then I'll settle down for the rest of my life
Now that you're livin' with me, oh,
Now that you're livin' with me 
Oh, you brighten my life
Fill me with a burnin' desire
Oh, you lighten my life
Touch me and I'm feelin' on fire
We're never ever gonna lose
This feeling that we're feeling tonight
oh, oh
We're never ever gonna let it happen
'Cause it wouldn't be right
Wouldn't be right 
Oh, you lighten my life
Fill me with a burnin' desire
Oh, you brighten my life
Touch me and I'm feeling on fire
We're never ever gonna lose this feeling
That we're feeling tonight
Oh, oh
We're never gonna ever let it happen
'Cause it wouldn't be right
Oh, oh ,oh
