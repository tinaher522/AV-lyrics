<song artist="Peter_Cetera" title="Restless_Heart">
I don't wanna lose you 
I don't want you walking away
We're so good together 
Tell me it's forever
'Cause I want you to stay
I'll be damned if 
I'm living without you
And as long as I live 
You will know
I just wanna build 
My world around you
Don't want you to go
Don't leave me here 
With my restless heart
The one you fill with the emotion 
Baby right from the start
'Cause the hardest part is being alone 
With my restless heart
Hmmm, with my restless heart
Tell me where you want me
Anytime, I don't care
Tell me when you need me
'Cause baby when you need me
I will be right there
(I will be right there)
I'll be damned if 
I'm living without you
And as long as I live
You will know
I will never build 
A wall around you
And I don't want you to go
Don't leave me here 
With my restless heart
The one you fill with the emotion 
Baby right from the start
And the hardest part is being alone 
With my restless
With my restless
With my restless heart
I'll be damned if 
I'm living without you
And as long as I live
You will know
I just wanna build 
My world around you
I don't want you to go
Don't leave me here 
With my restless heart
The one you fill with the emotion 
Baby right from the start
'Cause the hardest part is being alone 
With my restless
With my restless
With my restless heart
Don't leave me here 
With my restless heart
The one you fill with the emotion 
Baby right from the start
'Cause the hardest part is being alone 
With my restless heart
With my restless
Don't leave me here 
With my restless heart
The one you fill with the emotion 
Baby right from the start
'Cause the hardest part is being alone 
With my restless
With my restless
With my restless heart
