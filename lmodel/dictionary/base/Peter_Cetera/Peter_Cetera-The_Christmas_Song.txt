<song artist="Peter_Cetera" title="The_Christmas_Song">
Chestnust roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yultide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Will help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight
They know that Santa's on his way
He loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child, ooh, is going to spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly
So I'm offering this simple phrase
For kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
"Merry Christmas to you"
So I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said, many times, many ways
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas to you
