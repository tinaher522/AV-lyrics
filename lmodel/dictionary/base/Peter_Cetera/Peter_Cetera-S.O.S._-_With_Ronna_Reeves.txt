<song artist="Peter_Cetera" title="S.O.S._-_With_Ronna_Reeves">
Where are those happy days
They seem so hard to find
I tried to reach for you
But you have closed your mind
Whatever happened to our love
I wish I understood
It used to be so nice
Used to be so good
So when you're near me
Darling, can't you hear me
S.o.s.
[Incomprehensible] you give me love
Nothin' else can save me
S.o.s.
When you're gone
How can I even try to live on
When you're gone
Though I try how can I carry on
You seem so far away
Though you are standing near
You made me feel alive
Something died I fear
I really tried to make it out
I wish I understood
What happened to our love
It used to be so good
When you're near me
Darling, can't you hear me
S.o.s.
[Incomprehensible] give me love
Nothin' else can save me
S.o.s.
When you're gone
How can I even try to hold on
When you're gone
Though I try how can I carry on
Whatever happened to our love
Ooh, I wish I understood
It used to be so nice
Used to be so good
So when you're near me
Darling, can't you hear me
S.o.s.
[Incomprehensible] you give me love
Nothin' else can save me
S.o.s.
So when you're near me
Darling, can't you hear me
S.o.s.
[Incomprehensible] you give me love
Nothin' else can save me
S.o.s.
S.o.s.
S.o.s.
S.o.s.
