<song artist="Peter_Cetera" title="Evil_Eye">
You've got an evil eye
And I wanna say mama
I can't face it for another day
You don't even try
And I wanna say baby
I can't take it when you're...
Makin' me hurry, makin' me wait
Takin' me early, leavin' me late
Shakin' my feelin', makin' me cry
Don't it sound funny
But I'm saying bye-bye 
You've got an evil eye
And I wanna say mama
You can't see it any other way
All you do is lie
And I wanna say baby
You know I can't stand it when you're...
Makin' me hurry, makin' me wait
Takin' me early, leavin' me late
Shakin' my feelin', makin' me cry
Don't it sound funny
But I'm saying bye-bye 
I don't need what you're givin' me honey
You know I don't want
What you've got on your mind
I don't care if you're missin' my money
You know I don't care if you're stealin' me blind
I'll leave you behind 
Oh well, leavin' you baby
So long bye-bye
Oh well, when you're drivin' me crazy
So long bye-bye
Oh well, don't believe it's funny
So long bye-bye
Oh well, now I'm movin' on honey
So long bye-bye
