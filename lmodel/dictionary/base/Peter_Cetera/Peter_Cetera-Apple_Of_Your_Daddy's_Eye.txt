<song artist="Peter_Cetera" title="Apple_Of_Your_Daddy's_Eye">
I remember when you were born
I felt like one lucky
Son of a gun 
And when you turned into two
I was so happy
When you said I love you 
Held you in my arms so tight
I'd never forget
The best years of my life 
Apple of your daddy's eye
Wanna be the one to hold you in the night
Apple of your daddy's eye
Oh, oh sleep tight
Don't you worry gonna be alright 
I remember when you were three
You were so lovely
So very pretty 
And when you turned into four
I finally realized
What God put her here for 
Apple of your daddy's eye
Wanna be the one to hold you in the night
Apple of your daddy's eye
Oh, oh sleep tight
Don't you worry gonna be alright 
If I had my way
Time would stand still
You'd stay as sweet as you are
But time waits for no one
It never will
Your gonna leave me soon enough
I'm just sad 'cause you're growing up 
Held you in my arms so tight
I'd never forget
The best years of my life 
Apple of your daddy's eye
Wanna be the one to hold you in the night
Apple of your daddy's eye
Oh, oh sleep tight
Don't you worry gonna be alright 
Don't stop ever lovin' me because
You're the apple of your daddy's eye 
Don't stop ever lovin' me because
You're the apple of your daddy's eye
