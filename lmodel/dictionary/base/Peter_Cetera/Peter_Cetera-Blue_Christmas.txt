<song artist="Peter_Cetera" title="Blue_Christmas">
I'll have a blue Christmas without you
I'll be so blue thinking about you
Decorations of red on a green Christmas tree
Won't be the same if, if you're not here with me
And when those blue snow flakes start falling
That's when those blue memories start calling
You'll be doing alright with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue, a blue, blue Christmas
You'll be doing alright with your Christmas of white
But I'll, I'll have a blue, a blue, blue Christmas
And I'll, I'll have a blue, a blue, blue Christmas
