<song artist="Peter_Cetera" title="Whatever_Gets_You_Through">
Hey, hey, now can't you see that's life?
Take a look around you now
Some days you shine
Some days it all unwinds
Fly high above your fears be sure
Never let them rain on you
And should they fall
Then after all
Whatever gets you through it takes
Whatever gets you through, believe
Whatever gets you through your life
I'm so tired of always finding my world so bare
Look around you now, life isn't always fair
Whatever gets you through will get you there
I'm so tired of always finding my world so bare
Look around you now, life isn't always fair
Whatever gets you through will get you there
Whatever gets you through it takes
Whatever gets you through, believe
Whatever gets you through your life
Whatever gets you through it takes
Whatever gets you through, believe
Whatever gets you through your life
