<song artist="Peter_Cetera" title="Wanna_Be_There">
I wanna be there
When you turn out the lights
I wanna be there 
But I'm here on this lonely highway
In the middle of nowhere 
I wanna hold you
If you wake up in the night
I wanna hold you 
I wanna be there in the morning
I wanna touch you
'Cause you know tonight
There's nowhere else that I would rather be
I'm not the same when you're not here with me
Close your eyes and say a little prayed
And baby I'm gonna be there 
I wanna be there
I wanna be there
Wanna be there in the morning
Oh, I wanna be there
