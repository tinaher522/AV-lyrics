<song artist="Peter_Cetera" title="World_Falling_Down">
Well I never thought life would be easy
You can take it from me it's not easy
When you're living on your own
And now I face it one day at a time 
Then I try to rise each time I fall
Try to find a way of getting through it all 
I used to believe in you
Now I need someone else to turn to
And though it's only a matter of time 
Then I find that when you lose the magic
Suddenly your world comes falling down
All around you
And though it seems so tragic
Even when there's no one else around
You hear the sound
Of another world that's falling down 
Leaving your memories behind me
Hoping that nothing reminds me
Praying that I can forget
And even now I take it one step at a time
And now I face the future eye to eye
I know it won't be easy, but I'll get by 
I used to believe in you
Now I need someone else to turn to
And though it's only a matter of time 
Then I find that when you lose the magic
Suddenly your world comes falling down
All around you
And though it seems so tragic
Even when there's no one else around
You hear the sound
Of another world that's falling down 
I used to believe in you
Now I need someone else to turn to
And though it's only a matter of time 
Then I find that when you lose the magic
Suddenly your world comes falling down
All around you
And though it seems so tragic
Even when there's no one else around
You hear the sound
Of another world that's falling down
