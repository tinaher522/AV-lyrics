<song artist="Peter_Cetera" title="The_Lucky_Ones">
Sometimes you're sentimental
I know exactly what to do
And if I'm temperamental
You calm me down and you pull me through 
We are the lucky ones
We have one another
When the end of the day has come
I return to you 
Life can be so demanding
Sometimes it's hard to make it through
It's love and understanding
You give to me, I give to you 
We are the lucky ones
We have one another
When the end of the day has come
I return to you 
Our own fairy tale
Our favorite bedtime story
One that we won't forget
We fell in love
We knew from the start
We'd always be together
The first time that we met
Can't forget 
We are the lucky ones
We have one another
When the end of the day has come
I return to you 
All alone in the setting sun
I'll have you and you'll have me
