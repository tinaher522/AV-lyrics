<song artist="Peter_Cetera" title="Feels_Like_Heaven">
All through my wandering years 
I always said 
I was biding my time 
All alone in the dark 
I'd faced my fears 
That no other heart would come to mine 
At first when you found me 
It took me a while 
'til I realised 
Why I felt weak 
When you were around 
Why I couldn't speak 
When I looked in your eyes 
All this time 
I've been searching 
Until you, I was lost in my dreams 
And I never knew that love 
Could feel like heaven 
Watching over me 
Wherever you are
Invisible hands reach over the miles 
For every wish 
You make to the stars 
There's one silent kiss 
I send to the sky 
All this time 
I've been searching 
Until you I was lost in my dreams 
And I [pause] never knew that love could feel like heaven 
Watching over me 
Everything's changed 
Since you came my way
(Since you came my way)  
You put the colour 
In a world of grey 
And you make the love 
That carries me away 
All this time 
I've been searching 
Until you 
I was lost in my dreams 
And I never knew that love could 
Feel like heaven 
Watching over me 
You know that it feels like heaven 
Watching over me
Watching over me
Feels like heaven
