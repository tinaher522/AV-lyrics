Rain Rain Love
Rain Rain Love
Rain Rain Love
Rain Rain Love
Threw out my old raincoat
Set sail without a boat
For places somewhere far beyond my dreams
As the sky came pouring down
I lay down on the ground
Like I was dreaming, I let the feeling wash all over me
Rain Love Covered around me
Rain Rain Love Finally found me
This time you're gonna recognise
One drop will open up your eyes
Rain Love
It's the colour of every sky
It's the way to change the tide
When the world is crumbling down on you and me
It's the calm that lifts the storm
It's the promise that keeps you warm
When you don't understand, just touch the guiding hand that comforts me
Rain Love...
Takes this lot to make you realise
No greater love could ever fill the sky
Rain Love....
