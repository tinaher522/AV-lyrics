<song artist="Peter_Cetera" title="Perfect_World">
Little White House in a little old town
Stuck in the middle of nowhere
Stars shine bright when the sun goes down
it's a perfect world as long as you're there
Count my blessings and save my prayers
Love waking up in the morning
Sunlight shining upon your hair
and you're lying next to me
Blue sky over fields of green
I'm as happy as i've ever been
One thing makes it all so clear
it's a perfect world as long as you're there
Count my blessings and save my prayers
Love waking up in the morning
Sunlight shining upon your hair
and you're lying next to me
Count my blessings and save my prayers
Love waking up every morning
The Sun is shining upon your hair
when you're lying next to me
and it's where I wanna be
Don't wanna live near the lights of the city
I like it right where I am
just to be part of a woman in love
with the heart of a simple man
[mhmhmhmm]
Count my blessings and save my prayers
love waking up in the morning
sunlight shining upon your hair
and you're lying next to me
Count my blessings and save my prayers
love waking up in the morning
the sun is shining upon your hair
when you're lying next to me
And it's where I wanna be.
Ohoo when you're next to me
I'm exactly where I wanna be
Ohoo when you're next to me
I'm exactly where I wanna be
Ohoo when you're next to me
I'm exactly where I wanna be
Ohoo when you're next to me
I'm exactly where I wanna be
Ohoo when you're next to me
I'm exactly where I wanna be
