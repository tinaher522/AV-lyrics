<song artist="Peter_Cetera" title="I'll_Be_Home_For_Christmas">
I'll be home for Christmas
You can count on me
Please have snow and mistletoe
Presents by the tree
Christmas Eve will find me
Where the love light glows
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams
Christmas Eve will find me
Where the love light gleams
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams
If only in my dreams
