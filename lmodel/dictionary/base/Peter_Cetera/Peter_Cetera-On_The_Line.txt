<song artist="Peter_Cetera" title="On_The_Line">
I was drivin' along at the end of the day
I was weary and so all alone
Looking ahead by the side of the road
What I saw was the sign "Telephone" 
Talking to you is something I need
More than I needed before
If I ever get through won't you give me the time
Won't you answer my call, won't you stay on the line 
It's a moment of truth then a shadow of doubt
Now I need you to stay on the line
It's never as bad when we're talkin' it out
Now I need you to stay on the line 
Talking to you is something I need
More than I needed before
If I ever get through won't you give me the time
Won't you answer my call, won't you stay on the line 
Answer my call, won't you stay on the line 
I believe I have a right to say
What I wanna say
And I believe it but I'm keeping it to myself
I believe I have a right to do
What I wanna do 
All of my life, all of my life
All of my life, all of my life 
I believe I have a right to be
Where I wanna be
I believe it and I wanna be there with you
I believe I have a right to see
Who I wanna see
All of my life, all of my life
All of my life, all of my life
All of my life, all of my life
All of my life, all of my life
