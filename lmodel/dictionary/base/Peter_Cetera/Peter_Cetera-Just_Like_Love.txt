<song artist="Peter_Cetera" title="Just_Like_Love">
See the color of roses
Sail across America
I couldn't wait to find you
I'm looking for a miracle
And somewhere out of the blue
In the heart of getting by
It only takes a second to learn
It only takes a second to hurt
And it's just like love to be the hardest thing
It's just like love to be everything
It's just like love to be everything
An illusion of laughter
Lost in a desert sky
That's how I feel without you
I can't take another night
Somewhere out of the blue
From my heart and in your eyes
It only takes a second to learn
It only takes a second to hurt
And it's just like love to be the hardest thing
It's just like love to be everything
It's just like love to be everything
Oh I can feel it all
Right or wrong I'm here
Here for you
It only takes a second to learn
It only takes a second to hurt
And it's just like love to be the hardest thing
It's just like love to be everything
It's just like love to be everything
