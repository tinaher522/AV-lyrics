<song artist="Peter_Cetera" title="Solitude-Solitaire">
Lying here thinking of a place to hide
I've got to get away
There are times like this when I'm better off by myself 
Stuck in a corner
Nothing more to lose, I'm a goner
I'm just chained by thoughts, surrounded by walls
And they're closing in around me 
Lying here waiting for the chance to run
I need to isolate
There are times like this when I'd rather be left alone 
Caught in a panic
Trying not to look like a manic 
Got to move, got to go
Got to get out of here
Leave this all behind me 
Solitude, Solitaire
No one will ever find me there
Solitude, Solitaire
Won't you give me some bread, give me some water
Solitude, Solitaire
No one will ever find me there
Got to find peace of mind, clear the air 
Mass confusion
Leaving me with no solution
If you find I'm asleep, better leave me alone
I'll wake up when it's over 
Solitude, Solitaire
No one will ever find me there
Solitude, Solitaire
Won't you give me some bread, give me some water
Solitude, Solitaire
No one will ever find me there
Got to find peace of mind, clear the air 
Solitude, Solitaire
No one will ever find me there
Solitude, Solitaire
Won't you give me some bread, give me some water
Solitude, Solitaire
No one will ever find me there
Got to find peace of mind, clear the air 
Won't you give me some bread, give me some water
Got to find peace of mind, clear the air
