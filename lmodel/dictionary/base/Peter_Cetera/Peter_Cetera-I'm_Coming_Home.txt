<song artist="Peter_Cetera" title="I'm_Coming_Home">
Every time I wake up somewhere faraway
Counting all the minutes back to yesterday
I wonder what you're doing, do you feel this way
Are you thinking of me too
Looking in the mirror all I wanna see
Is your pretty face smilling back at me
There's nowhere in the world that I would rather be
Than to be back home with you
I'm on my way, I promise you that I won't be long
I just called, called you to say 
I've missed every little moment without you
And I can't wait for us to be alone
I'm almost in your arms, I'm coming home
I'm coming home
At night when I'm alone I really miss your touch
I hold on to your picture and it means so much
To know that there is someone out there just for me
And do you feel the same way too 
Everywhere I go I wish that you were there
Everything I do I wish that we could share
Everywhere I go- makes me miss you so
I'm on my way, I promise you that I won't be long
I just called, called you to say 
I've missed every little moment without you
And I can't wait for us to be alone
I'm almost in your arms, I'm coming home
I'm coming home
I can touch you anytime I close my eyes
Baby, you can feel it, if you just believe 
I'm coming home
I'm on my way, I promise you that I won't be long
I just called, called you to say 
I've missed every little moment without you
And I can't wait for us to be alone
I'm almost in your arms, I'm coming home
I'm coming home
