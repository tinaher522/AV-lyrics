<song artist="Peter_Cetera" title="Only_Love_Knows_Why">
One more sad tomorrow
And I am not very good at hiding my sorrow
It's not the same without you
So alone and so afraid
I thought we had it made
What about us, what about the way
We were so in love
When we were together
I thought you'd never leave
Now I know this time you're gone forever
Only love can break your heart
Fill you with desire
And tear you all apart
Only love can make you cry
Only love knows why
One more night without you
I'm just trying to pretend
That you're coming back again
I know I never meant to doubt you
Oh no, we were young and we were free
Now I can't believe this has happened to me
What about us
What about the way
We were so in love
When we were together
Only love can break your heart
Fill you with desire
And tear you all apart
Only love can make you cry
Only love knows whyOnly love can break your heart
Fill you with desire
And tear you all apart
Only love can make you cry
Only love knows why
It's gonna be a long hard road without you
And there's one thing you should know
Tell me who will I turn to
When I get in trouble
Ooh really don't want you to go
Tell me who can I turn to
When I get in trouble
Baby please don't leave me
Can't you see, you won't believe me
Chorus
