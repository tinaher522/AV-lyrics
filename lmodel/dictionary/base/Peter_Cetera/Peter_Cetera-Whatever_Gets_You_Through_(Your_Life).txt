<song artist="Peter_Cetera" title="Whatever_Gets_You_Through_(Your_Life)">
Hey-hey now can't you see
That's life
Take a look around you now
Some days you shine
Some days it all unwinds
Fly-high above your fears
Be sure
Never let them rain on you
And should they fall
Then after all
Whatever gets you through
It takes
Whatever gets you through
Believe
Whatever gets you through
Your life
I'm so tired of always finding my world so bare
Look around you now
Life isn't always fair
Whatever gets you through
Will get you there 
Will get you there 
Whatever gets you through
It takes
Whatever gets you through
Believe
Whatever gets you through
Your life
Whatever gets you through
It takes
Whatever gets you through
Believe
Whatever gets you through
Your life
