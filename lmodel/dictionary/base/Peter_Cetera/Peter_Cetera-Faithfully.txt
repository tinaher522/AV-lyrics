<song artist="Peter_Cetera" title="Faithfully">
Some say it's just the nature of the beast
When you love somebody so passionately
Time has a way stealing
That raging fire you're feeling
Leaving the ashes laying at your feet
Those fools of little faith will never know
Those higher places two hearts can go
Where time is standing still
And love will burn until
The heaven and the earth have come and gone
This fire inside for you is constant as the morning star
And you will be forever in my heart
As long as there's a river searching for an endless sea
I will always love you... faithfully
Tonight we'll raise a glass to lovers, across the ages
We'll hold each other and toast to the day
When history (is) said and done and we'll still stand as one
Some things were never meant to fade away
This fire inside for you is constant as the morning star
And you will be forever in my heart
As long as there's a river searching for an endless sea
I will always love you ...faithfully
This fire inside for you is constant as the morning star
And you will be forever in my heart
As long as there's a river searching for an endless sea
I will always love you... faithfully
