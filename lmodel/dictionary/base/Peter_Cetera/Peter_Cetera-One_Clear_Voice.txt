<song artist="Peter_Cetera" title="One_Clear_Voice">
The whole world is talking
Drowning out my voice
How can I hear myself
With all this noise
But all this confusion
Just disappears
When I find a quiet place
Where I can hear 
One clear voice
Calling out for me to listen
One clear voice
Whispers words of wisdom
I close my eyes
'Till I find what I've been missing
If I'm very still, I will hear
One clear voice 
I'm always searching
For which path to take
Sometimes I'm so afraid
To make mistakes
From somewhere inside me
Stronger than my fears
Just like the sound of music
To my ears, I hear 
One clear voice
Calling out for me to listen
One clear voice
Whispers words of wisdom
I close my eyes
'Till I find what I've been missing
If I'm very still, I will hear
One clear voice
