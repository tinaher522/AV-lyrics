<song artist="Janet_Jackson" title="Communication">
It's traveling faster than the eye can see
Information in the sky
Messages beamed across the atmosphere
Transmitted by you and I
Chorus:
Communication
Say the words
Are you there?
Can I be heard?
First indication
Heart to heart
Come together
Worlds apart
Oh, thank heavens for the microwave
Can't ignore technology
It's so easy to communicate
How come you're not hearin' me
Chorus 2:
Communication
Say the words
Are you there?
Can I be heard?
Station to station
Coast to coast
Face to face
Will tell you most
Now we're livin' in the computer age
The picture's on my video
I keep your number in my database
Turn it onto audio
Communication
Say the words
Are you there?
Can I be heard? (why don't you say that you need me)
Person to person
Heart to heart
Come together
Worlds apart
Repeat Chorus 2
Repeat Chorus
Communication
Say the words (why don't you say it babe)
Are you there? (why don't you say it babe)
Can I be heard? (why don't you say it babe)
Communication (why don't you say it babe)
Heart to heart
Come together
Worlds apart
Communication
