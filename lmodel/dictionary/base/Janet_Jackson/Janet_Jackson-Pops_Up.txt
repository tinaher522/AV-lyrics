<song artist="Janet_Jackson" title="Pops_Up">
Hey Rich U got me in here, I'm chillin like a muthaf**ker
Ooooooooooo..Oh..hey (x4) 
Betcha think I'm the type to not speak 
Look away everytime our eyes meet 
And I never smile, never wanna seem sweet 
Forwardness no my .. so beneath me 
No need to judge me prematurely 
As long as we don't leave here too early 
So little time to discover what turns me on 
Hold me tight and let's talk while I'm sittin' on ya 
(Chorus) 
I'ma sit on ya lap and we can just talk 
I'ma sit on ya lap and we can just talk 
Don't worry, relax.. I'm real soft 
I'ma sit on ya lap and we can talk 
'Bout the first thing that pops up *pop noise*, Pops up 
(x3) 
'Bout the first thing that pops up, good thing it popped up oh 
Put ya hand on my thigh 
Put a little pressure on it 
Rub it just a little bit 
Tell me what else's on ya mind 
I'ma put some pressure on ya 
Say it if you think it 
Ain't no need to be scared 
Let's discuss this energy 
Oh it's just not enough 
Oh that's my song 
Hold me tight while I work it 
Watch me grind 
Move my body in a circle on you 
(Chorus) 
I'ma sit on ya lap and we can just talk 
I'ma sit on ya lap and we can just talk 
Don't worry, relax.. I'm real soft 
I'ma sit on ya lap and we can talk 
'Bout the first thing that pops up *pop noise*, Pops up 
(x3) 
'Bout the first thing that pops up, good thing ya popped up 
Ho, oh oh oh oh oh oh (x8) 
The more we start to touch 
The more I start to see 
Tonight don't have to end 
If you and I believe (If we believe) 
Cause' with every whisper I get 
a little more and more excited 
I can see you feel it too.. 
*Pop noise* 
Spoken: Oooo.. 
(Chorus) 
I'ma sit on ya lap and we can just talk 
I'ma sit on ya lap and we can just talk 
I wanna relax.. I'm real soft 
I'ma sit on ya lap and we can talk 
'Bout the first thing that pops up *pop noise*, Pops up 
(x3) 
'Bout the first thing that pops up, good thing ya popped up
