<song artist="Janet_Jackson" title="Speaker_Phone">
(I get so lonely)
(I can't let just anybody hold me)
(You are the one that lives in me, my dear)
(Want no one but you)
Hello?
Hi, it's me.
You got me on that damn speaker phone?
Yeah, I do.
What you doin' with your hands that you can't pick up the phone?
Don't you worry about it, I'm takin' care of my business.
Ha ha ha...
What you doin'?
Nothin'...hold on...lemme just...okay...here we go...I'm back.
I'm going out tonight...maybe.  Wait, hold on...uh...
Your coochie gonna swell up and fall apart.
