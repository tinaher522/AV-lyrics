<song artist="Janet_Jackson" title="Take_Care">
Glass of wine,
Candlelight,
Music made for quiet times,
I'm feelin' mellow,
I need my,
Sweetie pie,
You to lay me out tonight,
I want it,
I want it,
But I can't get it,
Take good care of me tonight...
At home,
I'm so alone,
I'm wishin' you were here,
Baby tonight,
My bed is cold,
I'm wishin' you were near,
Cause I'm in a sexy mood,
And only you can fill my needs,
I'll lay here,
And take care of it,
'Til you come home to me,
Always sound sensuous,
Anytime we pillow talk,
You send such few words,
I get sensitive when you work,
It feels so good when it hurts,
Always want more and more,
And I know you can't be here,
Then usually to faze me, 
I need you tonight,
Boy it's drivin' me crazy,
I'm yearnin' inside,
With this burnin' desire,
I want it and want it,
But I just can't get it from you,
Take good care of me tonight...
At home,
I'm so alone,
I'm wishin' you were here,
Baby tonight,
My bed is cold,
I'm wishin' you were near,
Cause I'm in a sexy mood,
And only you can fill my needs,
I'll lay here,
And take care of it,
'Til you come home to me,
Ah ah,
Take care of me,
Ah ah,
Fufill my needs,
Ah ah,
Take care of me,
Take good care of me...
Ah ah,
Take care of me,
Ah ah,
Fufill my needs,
Ah ah
Whatever you can be,
Ah ah,
Now take good care of me,
Take good care of me tonight...
At home,
I'm so alone,
I'm wishin' you were here,
Baby tonight,
My bed is cold,
I'm wishin' you were near,
Cause I'm in a sexy mood,
And only you can fill my needs,
I'll lay here,
And take care of it,
'Til you come home to me,
At home,
I'm so alone,
I'm wishin' you were here,
Baby tonight,
My bed is cold,
I'm wishin' you were near,
Cause I'm in a sexy mood,
And only you can fill my needs,
I'll lay here,
And take care of it,
'Til you come home to me,
Ah ah,
Take care of me,
Ah ah,
Fufill my needs,
Ah ah,
Take care of me,
Take good care of me...
Ah ah,
Take care of me,
Ah ah,
Fufill my needs,
Ah ah,
Whatever you can be,
Ah ah,
Now take care of me...
