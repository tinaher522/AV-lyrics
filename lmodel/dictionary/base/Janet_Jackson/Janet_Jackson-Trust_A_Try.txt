<song artist="Janet_Jackson" title="Trust_A_Try">
Trust not an easy thing you say
Never thought the game of love 
This way you'd play 
By the things you do 
Never thought these things
I would go through with you 
Pain trickery and deceit 
All the wrongs that you put me through
Even though I must say 
Still love you anyway 
Never do believe my words 
When I try telling you my story
Have no reason, still don't trust me
No I'm not a cheat or liar
 
She brought love 
She brought joy 
She brought what she brought
You thought you'd never see again
She cheats and lied 
Made you cry 
Said goodbye 
Bodies numb 
Think you're never gonna feel again 
Then what you do now You take it slow 
Here comes Jo
Things go smooth
But drama just around the bend
Don't blame me for jealousies 
Or insecurities 
Please see 
'Cause I wouldn't do that to you
Don't smother me (with misery)
This place is just killing me
Accusing me (of polygamy) 
I feel I'm suffocating
If not the trust (then we have what)
It's too dark in it for me
Gotta be strong (Oh keep holding on)
I wanna love with you try 
Don't smother me with your pain and
Misery. Baby, please quit 
Accusing me of all this 
Polygamy. Oh, can't you see if
Not the trust, baby then 
We have what? Oh, nothin'. 'Gotta
Be strong for me please and 
Keep holdin' on. Oh, baby.
Wanna second chance with this love
This romance 
Wanna make it last
Forget your past 
She hurt you back
Lets start anew 
Yes that means me and you
Gonna make it through 
But you must give trust a try
Gotta be strong 
With this love 
Hold on 
Gotta trust in me
And we will see true victory
We'll love with ease 
Baby please trust in me 
It'll be heavenly
But you must give trust a try
You got burned 
You got bruised
You got 
So you got a kick outta that
Unhealthy shit
You said to she
You'd please her needs
Whatever it'd be 
Still she'd cheat 
On her back again for the money
Now learn from it 
You grow from it 
Get over it 
I won't take the blame
So don't 
'Cause I ain't having it
'Stead of given me 
The third degree 
That's so mean 
Don't push me out the door
I wouldn't do that to you
Don't smother me (with misery)
Accusing me (of polygamy) 
If not the trust (then we have what)
Gotta be strong (Oh keep holding on)
 
Don't smother me with your pain and
Misery. Baby, please quit 
Accusing me of all this 
Polygamy. Oh, can't you see if
Not the trust, baby then 
We have what? Oh, nothin'. 'Gotta
Be strong for me please and 
Keep holdin' on. Oh, baby. 
Wanna second chance with this love
This romance 
Wanna make it last
Forget your past 
She hurt you bad 
Lets start anew 
Yes that means me and you
Gonna make it through 
But you must give trust a try
Gotta be strong 
With this love 
Hold on 
Gotta trust in me
And we will see true victory
We'll love with ease 
Baby please trust in me 
It'll be heavenly
But you must give trust a try
Don't smother me (with misery)
Accusing me (of polygamy)
