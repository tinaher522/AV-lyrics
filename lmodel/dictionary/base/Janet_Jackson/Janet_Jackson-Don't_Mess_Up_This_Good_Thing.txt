Don't mess up this good thing
Don't mess up this good thing
Don't mess up this good thing
Don't mess up this good thing
Well, I think you've had a long time
To get your act together
It's your move and I hope you do the right thing
You know I never wanna lose you
But you must learn to play the game by the rules 
Show me how much my love means to you
Don't mess up this good thing
Don't mess up this good thing (what we have together) 
Don't mess up, no baby
Well, forever may be
More time than anyone can offer
But all my time is spent in your corner
Heaven knows how much I love you
But if you think I can watch you play on me and understand it
Baby, you're taking far too much for granted
Don't mess up this good thing
Don't mess up this good thing (what we have together)
Don't mess up this good thing
Don't mess up this good thing (if you still believe)
Don't mess up this good thing
Don't mess up, baby (no one can love you better)
Don't mess up this good thing
Don't mess up this good thing
Got to find the right words to make you see
That you and I were meant to be
Don't mess up this good thing
Don't mess it up
Don't mess up this good thing
Well, forever may be
More time than anyone can offer
But all my time is spent in your corner
Heaven knows how much I love you
But if you think I can watch you play on me and understand it
Baby, you're taking far too much for granted
Don't mess up this good thing
Don't mess up this good thing (what we have together)
Don't mess up this good thing
Don't mess up this good thing (if you still believe)
Don't mess up this good thing (ooh don't mess it up baby)
Don't mess up this good thing (no one can love you better)
Don't mess up this good thing (sho' don't mess it up)
Don't mess up this good thing (I've got what you need)
Don't mess up this good thing
Don't mess up this good thing (what we've got together)
Don't mess up this good thing
