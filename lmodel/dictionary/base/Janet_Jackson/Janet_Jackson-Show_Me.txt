<song artist="Janet_Jackson" title="Show_Me">
You know I've heard every line
No baby not this time
If you want it like you say you want it
Well then you gotta
When I'm next to you
I get this feeling that maybe I'm willing to stay next to you
But the thing is boy you don't like work
And I'm telling you
That nothing this good gonna come that easy
It will never do
Baby be ready when you come to me
You know I've heard every line
Now baby not this time
If you want it like you say you want it
Well then you gotta
Show me
How bad do you want it?
How bad do you want it?
Whoa oh whoa show me
How bad do you need it?
How bad do you need it?
Show me
How bad do you want it?
How bad do you want it?
Whoa oh whoa show me
How bad do you need it?
Cause actions speak louder than words
When you're kissing me
Ya don't go slow and it lets me know
That you're not listening
When I say that I don't like to rush
So I'ma step back or make you work for it
Fall back and see how bad you want it
You say you're into me
Well talk is cheap and
You know I've heard every line
No baby not this time
If you want it like you say you want it
Well then you gotta
Show me
How bad do you want it?
How bad do you want it?
Whoa oh whoa show me
How bad do you need it?
How bad do you need it?
Show me
How bad do you want it?
How bad do you want it?
Whoa oh whoa show me
How bad do you need it?
Cause actions speak louder than words.
[Repeat]
Show me
Smooth that out
Ohhhh show show shows me
S.H.O. me, me
All my ladies say, S.H.O. me, me
See I hear you over there talking loud and shit
But can you B.A.C.K.I.T.U.P. boy, U.P. boy
But can you B.A.C.K.I.T.U.P. boy, U.P. boy
Talk to me S.H.O. me, me
All my ladies say, S.H.O. me, me
See I hear you over there talking loud
But you got to
Show me
How bad do you want it?
How bad do you want it?
Whoa oh whoa show me
How bad do you need it? How bad do you need it?
Show me
How bad do you want it?
How bad do you want?
Whoa oh whoa show me
How bad do you need it?
Cause actions speak louder than words
[Repeat]
