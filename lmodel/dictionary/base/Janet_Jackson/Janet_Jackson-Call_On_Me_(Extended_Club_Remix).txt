<song artist="Janet_Jackson" title="Call_On_Me_(Extended_Club_Remix)">
You can reach
But you can't grab it
You can hold it, control it
No, you can't bag it
You can push
But you can't direct it
Circulate, regulate, oh no
You cannot connect it
You know you're chewing bubblegum
You know what that is
But you still want some
You just can't get enough
Of that lovie dovie stuff
You get confused
But you know it
Yeah, you hurt for, you work for a lover
You don't always show it
Let's go
Let's go
Discotheque
Let's go
Let's go
Let's go
Discotheque
You want to be the one
But you know you're someone else instead
You want to be the song
Be the song that you're hearing, yeah
Love...
(Heaven in your heart)
(You want heaven in your heart)
Love...
(You want heaven in your heart)
(You want heaven in your heart)
(You want heaven in your heart)
Love...
It's not a trick
'Cause you can't learn it
It's the way you don't pay, that's okay
'Cause you can't earn it
You know you're chewing bubblegum
You know what that is
But you still want some
You just can't get enough
Of that lovie dovie stuff
Let's go
Let's go
Discotheque
Go go
Go go
Discotheque
Love...
Go go
Discotheque
You're looking for the one
But you know you're somewhere else instead
You want to be the song
Be the song that you hear in your head
Love...
But you take what you can get
'Cause it's all that you can find
But you know there's something more
Tonight, tonight, tonight
And oh my...how so...
I...I can't get
I can't...not enough
I can't get in
I can't...not enough
I can't get in
I can't...not enough
Not enough
I can't...I can't...I
I can't get in...not...not
Love...
