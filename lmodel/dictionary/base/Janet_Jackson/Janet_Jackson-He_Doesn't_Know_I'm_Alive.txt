<song artist="Janet_Jackson" title="He_Doesn't_Know_I'm_Alive">
I've got his picture
It's on my dresser
Right next to my bed
He doesn't know me
But I sure know him
I can't get him out of my head
(Talk to him?)
I haven't even tried
He doesn't even know that I'm alive
He doesn't even know that I'm alive
I got his number, I call him up
Just to hear him say "hello"
And when he answers I always hang up
Ooh that boy scares me so
(Talk to him?)
I haven't even tried
He doesn't even know that I'm alive
He doesn't even know that I'm alive
Someday I'll find the nerve
To talk to him and stop acting so reserved
I told myself "Girl you gotta change"
'Cause nothing ventured is noting gained
Late last evening I dropped on by
Just to see if he was home
And when he opened the door
I could have died
There we were all alone
(Talk to him?)
I said, "excuse me I thought my friend lived here"
Well he doesn't even know that I'm alive
He doesn't know that I'm alive
He doesn't even know that I'm alive
He doesn't even know that I'm alive
He doesn't know that I'm alive
He doesn't even know
He doesn't know I'm alive
