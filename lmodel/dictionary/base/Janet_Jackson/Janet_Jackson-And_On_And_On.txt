<song artist="Janet_Jackson" title="And_On_And_On">
This is a song about summertime
May it never end, may it never end
This is a summer of love
And the love'll go
On and on and on and on
I'm not gonna stop, no
I'm not gonna stop, no
I'm not gonna stop, no
And this feeling goes
On and on and on and on and on
And the lovin' goes
On and on and on and on and on
Ooh, what a feeling that I'm feeling
Gotta keep this going
I've got the top down
Sun is beaming as I'm thinking about you
Never will you stop
This love that you feel
And I'll do the same
With you every day
I will always be
Right here by your side
I don't want nobody else
And this feeling goes
On and on and on and on and on
And the lovin' goes
On and on and on and on and on
Ooh what a feeling
Got me smiling
As I'm dreaming 'bout you
Oh you're my baby
So believe me when I tell ya
Never will you stop
This love that you feel
And I'll do the same
With you every day
I will always be
Right here by your side
I don't want nobody else
And this feeling goes
On and on and on and on and on
And the lovin' goes
On and on and on and on and on
Feel it, yeah... top down...
Just coolin'... summertime...
And this feeling goes on (feeling goes on, feeling goes on)
And this feeling goes on (feeling goes on, feeling goes on)
And this feeling goes on (feeling goes on, feeling goes on)
And this feeling goes on (feeling goes on, feeling goes on)
Damn this is a long song
And this feeling goes
On and on and on and on and on
And the lovin' goes
On and on and on and on and on
