<song artist="Janet_Jackson" title="Pretty_Boy">
Every girl, I know, wants a pretty man, uh huh
Every minute goes by, I still need your lovin' hand, oh no
I like ones that talk, no noise, baby, uh huh
I like you, you're such a pretty choice, uh huh
I like to play for you
You're such a pretty toy
Please let me play for you
You're such a pretty boy
Yes you are, yes you are, baby
Everybody knows, yes you are
Yes you are, baby
Love to take you in my arms
Share my secrets, to know my charm
You look so fine, I can't trust myself, baby
I'll do anything for you,
If you promise not to tell
I like to play for you
You're such a pretty toy
Please let me play for you
You're such a pretty boy
Yes you are, yes you are, baby
Everybody knows, yes you are
Yes you are, baby
Sing it up, ooh...
All I want is a pretty toy
All I need is a pretty boy
Yes you are, ooh, baby
Listen, I don't want your money
But I do need your honey
Then again, I'll take anything you've got
I think it's kind of funny
When you spend my money
But it's all right 'cause
You make me high pretty baby
Yes you are, yes you are, baby
Everybody knows, yes you are
Yes you are, babe
Get up
1... 2... 1, 2, 3, 4!
Play your funky horn
Play your funky horn
