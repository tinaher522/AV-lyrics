Young Love
Young Love
Young Love
Young Love
I may be young, but I'm not foolish
I can tell real love from a game
I'm not gonna let you use me
Heartbreak play mates, say it's not the same
Chorus:
Young love, (Ring around the roses)
Young love, (Searchin' for a heart so true)
Young love, (A pocket full of posies)
Young love, (All adds up to me and you)
I traded all my childish treasures
For a burnin' love so true
It's gonna be my first time around
Heartbreak's high game, love shake you down
Young love, (Ring around the roses)
Young love, (Searchin' for a heart so true)
Young love, (A pocket full of posies)
Young love, (All adds up to me and you)
Young love, (Ring around the roses)
Young love, (Searchin' for a heart so true)
Young love, (A pocket full of posies)
Young love, (All adds up to me and you)
(Young Love)
(Young Love)
(Young Love)
(Young Love)
Young Love (I may be young, but I'm not foolish)
Young Love (I can tell real love from a game)
Young Love (I'm not gonna let you use me)
Young Love (Heartbreak play mates, say it's not the same) 
Young love, (Ring around the roses)
Young love, (Searchin' for a heart so true)
Young love, (A pocket full of posies)
Young love, (All adds up to me and you)
(Young Love)
(Young Love)
(Young Love)
(Young Love)
Young love, (Ring around the roses)
Young love, (Searchin' for a heart so true)
Young love, (A pocket full of posies)
Young love, (All adds up to me and you)
(Young Love)
(Young Love)
(Young Love)
(Young Love)
Young love, 
Young love, (Searchin' for a heart so true)
Young love, (A pocket full of posies)
Young love, (All adds up to me and you)
