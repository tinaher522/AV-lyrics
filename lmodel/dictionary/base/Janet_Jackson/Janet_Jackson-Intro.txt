Why? For what reason? It actually looks pretty cool, and it goes with the music. 5,6,7 ga ga ga ga ga ga guh ga ga guh. Uh, I know, that's not it. Well, that's not so bad. I guess. No. You just gotta get it in u now. I know, right. I wish I had a lot of stuff in me now. Are u guys recording our conversation. I get the feeling you are. Are you, Jimmy? What're u talkin about? Just waitin on u, Jimmy. U can come any time, Jimmy. U sound like Fran Drescher.
