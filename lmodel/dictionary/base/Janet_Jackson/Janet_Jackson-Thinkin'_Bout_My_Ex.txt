<song artist="Janet_Jackson" title="Thinkin'_Bout_My_Ex">
When I first met you
I swear that I was straight with you
I wasn't lookin' for nobody new
I just needed someone to talk to
(To talk to) 
You said you were cool and understood
But now you caught feelings like I knew you would
And you sittin' there with a broken heart
Cause I gave you my body and not my heart 
When I'm holding you late at night
I'm thinkin' bout my ex
When I'm kissing you and look at you
I'm thinkin' bout my ex
And I'm sorry, I didn't mean to hurt you
And I know sorry doesn't mend your broken heart 
Baby I have to be
Unselfish and true to me
Cause I'm not where I really wanna be
And It's nothing with you
It's all me
(It's all me)
I toss and turn all night when I sleep
Wantin' and reachin' for someone who used to be
Said it must be some kinda karma thing
Cause I can't seem to let go (let go)
And love again 
When I lay with you I close my eyes
I'm thinkin' bout my ex
When I'm touchin' you gently
I'm thinkin' bout my ex
And I'm sorry (sorry)
I didn't mean to hurt you
And I know sorry doesn't mend your broken heart
When I'm listenin' to music
I'm thinking' bout my ex
In a bubble bath with the candles lit
I'm thinking bout my ex
And I'm sorry (sorry)
I didn't mean to hurt you
And I know sorry doesn't mend your broken heart 
You're beautiful 
I don't wanna take the space from someone else
So let me go
And do a little soul searchin' for myself
I'm sorry that 
I pulled you in and let it get this far
You know I never meant to break your heart 
At the shopping mall or movies
I'm thinkin' bout my ex
At the restaurant (restaurant) while I'm eating (eating)
I'm thinkin' bout my ex
And I'm sorry (sorry)
I didn't mean to hurt you
And I know sorry doesn't mend your broken heart
(Know that sorry doesn't mean...I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry, I'm)
While you talk to me
(Talk to me) 
I drift away
(I drift away)
I'm thinkin' bout my ex
When you ask me 
(Ask me)
What I'm thinkin'
(Thinkin')
I'm thinkin' bout my ex
And I'm sorry (sorry)
I didn't mean (didn't mean)
To hurt you
And I know sorry doesn't mend your broken heart 
(Know that sorry doesn't mean...I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry, I'm)
