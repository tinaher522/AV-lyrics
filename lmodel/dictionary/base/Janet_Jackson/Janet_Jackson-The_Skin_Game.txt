<song artist="Janet_Jackson" title="The_Skin_Game">
Oh
See you, you in there dancin',
And I'm in here needing questions and answers
(ha!, ha!), hey!, (ha!, ha!)
Ha!, hoo!, ha!, hoo!, ha!, hoo!, ha!
The dance is in
When they're mine
Try to learn the rules
Don't mind showin'
Equal chances (taught)
For our amuses
Not much can beat the odds
No excuses, let's play the skin game
(ha!, ha!, ha!), hoo!, (ha!, ha!, ha!), ooh!,(ha!, ha!)
Sing it!, ha!, hoo!, ha!, (sing it!), sing it!, ha!, hoo!, (your choice), ha!
You say your set
So let's get started
Try to be the best
But don't be that smart
You know what your brother gets
No need to complain
Just figure out, that there's a way to play,
To play the skin game
Chorus:
The skin game is still around, sing it!,
But you can't keep a good man down
(play the skin game)
(ha!, ha!, ha!), hoo!, ha!, (ha!, ha!), hoo!, (ha!, ha!) ha!, ( ha!), hoo!
Repeat chorus
Can't, can't, can't, can't, can't, can't, can't, can't
Keep a good man down
And I'm in here needing questions and answers
(ha!)
Hoo!
Repeat chorus
(and I'm in here needing questions and answers)
Outside lookin' in, in, in
The door is open, but you can't get in
Something's in the way
It's a skin game (oh, just a skin game)
Just a skin game
Let's play the skin game (game)
Hoo!, hoo!
(sing it for the people y'all)
Repeat chorus
The skin game is still around, sing it!,
But you can't, can't, can't, can't, can't, can't, can't, can't, can't
Keep a good man down,
Can't, can't, can't, can't, sing it!, can't, can't, can't, can't, sing it!
Repeat chorus
Hoo!
Break it down, sing it!
Hoo!
Sing it!
(sing it for the people y'all)
Sing it!
(sing it!, sing it!, sing it, sing it again!)
(sing it again, sing it again, and again, and again, and again, and again)
Repeat chorus
The skin game is still around
See you in there dancin',
And I'm in here needing questions and answers
