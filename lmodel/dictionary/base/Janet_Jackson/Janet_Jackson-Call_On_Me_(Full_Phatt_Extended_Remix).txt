<song artist="Janet_Jackson" title="Call_On_Me_(Full_Phatt_Extended_Remix)">
Sing it for me
Everybody come on
Y'all know what this is
I don't know if I've ever felt like this before
But I'm sure that the way I feel, I don't want it to go
'Cause I've cried my share of tears and I've sang my share of blues
But to keep you over here, I'll do what I got to do
So baby, call on me whether day or night, I'll never leave
See you don't have to be alone, I'll come anywhere you want
Baby, just pick up the phone and call on me
So you ain't know, I wanna be your homie, lover, friend
See there it go, see there it go
See I, I've never met a girl, that could break me down
It's like I get caught in the middle
I get caught up a little anytime that she's around
I be posted, waitin' on standby lookin' to catch the hint
I'm doin' whatever, whenever never forget I said
I'd be here when you want to get what you need
If you wanna receive, oh, please believe you could
Call on me whether day or night I'll never leave
See you don't have to be alone, I'll come anywhere you want
Baby, just pick up the phone and call on me
So you ain't know I wanna be your homie, lover, friend
See there it go, see there it go
Call on me when ya need someone who cares
Say the words and I'll be there, I can meet you anywhere
Call on me anytime that you please
Babe, whatever you want, be whatever you need
Because you're the one I love baby, yeah
Call on me whether day or night I'll never leave
See you don't have to be alone, I'll come anywhere you want
Baby, just pick up the phone and call on me
So you ain't know I wanna be your homie, lover, friend
See there it go, see there it go, mama
It don't matter where you go
I'll come anywhere you want me to
It don't matter near or far
It's like anything you say I'll do
And it don't matter where you go
I'll come anywhere you want me to
And it don't matter near or far
It's like anything you say I'll do
Everybody come on
Everybody come on
