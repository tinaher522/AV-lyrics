<song artist="Janet_Jackson" title="Hold_Back_The_Tears">
So sad, but there's nothin' that I can do
Things are so bad, forget every word I've spoken to you
Love is when it touches you down inside
Why really are you lookin' for somewhere to hide
You've gotta hold back the tears
Soon you will discover maybe there could be someone who cares for you
You've gotta hold back the tears
Don't have to say never, love will come to those who are prepared
Time will never be on your side
Listen, could be your only chance to survive
This love is waiting to call you home
Don't read you'll ever be on your own
You've gotta hold back the tears
Soon you will discover maybe there could be someone who cares for you
You've gotta hold back the tears
Don't have to say never, love will come to those who are prepared
To give it back
This is all you're ever gonna be
Well, is it all worth while
There's so much that I want you to see
It could be all worth while
