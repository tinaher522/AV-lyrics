<song artist="Janet_Jackson" title="You_Need_Me">
As a child I missed a lot of love I never had
And daddy, he was distant, never there to hold my hand
Never bought the things he'd always promise to give me
Mother made a point of always watching over me
Days would go by and we would never see his face
In my mind I'd wonder does he have another place?
If and when he'd come in he would always be upset
All the kids were scared, his looks would always be a threat
Now that you are older and you begin to see
Family's important, to be there if you need
Father never taught us, these things mom said to me
Now the table's turned so tell me you need me
Daddy daddy dearest, what is it you want from me
I won't turn my back on you the way you did with me
Now you're trying to give, I'm always reaching out to grab
I'll give you what I can but I can't give what I don't have
Mother lends a shoulder, to cry on if you need
But are you there for mother when she needs your company?
Father never taught us, these things mom said to me
Now the table's turned so tell me you need me
Say you need me
If you realize we need each other
We would be a closer family
I need you, yeah, I need you, and you know that
Say you need me 
Now that you are older and you begin to see
Family's important, to be there if you need
Father never taught us, these things mom said to me
Now the table's turned so tell me you need me
Say you need me
Just you wait
You'll need me
(How'd that groove go? hey!)
