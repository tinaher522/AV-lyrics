All my girls at the party
Look at that body
Shakin' that thing like you never did see
Got a nice package alright
'Cuz I'm gonna have to ride it tonight
All my girls at the party
Look at that body
Shakin' that thing like you never did see
Got a nice package alright
Edit, 4 3 2 1
Chicka ahh
It's all 4 you
If you really want it
It's all 4 you
If you say you need it
It's all 4 you
If you gotta have it
It's all 4 you if you make a move
It's all 4 you
I see you staring out the corner of my eye
You seem uneasy want to approach me, throw me a line
But then something inside you grabs you, says who am I
I know exactly 'cuz it happens with all the guys
So you so what you gonna do
Come on and talk to me
Promise you won't even have an attitude
I'll let you sit right next to me
Don't join the list of other fools
That ain't the way to be
Yes, it's cool, yes, I'm in the mood
Intimidations
(Then go to the chorus)
It's all 4 you
(Chicka ahh)
If you really want it
It's all 4 you
If you say you need it
It's all 4 you
If you gotta have it
It's all 4 you if you make a move
It's all 4 you
Can't be afraid or keep me waiting for too long
Before you know it
I'll be outta here I'll be gone
Don't try to be all clever, cute or even sly
Don't have to work that hard
Just be yourself and let that be your guide
So you so do what you gonna do
Come on and talk to me
Promise you won't even have an attitude
I'll even let you sit right next to me
Don't join the list with all the other fools
That ain't the way to be
Yes, it's cool, yes, I'm in the mood
Intimidations got that mind
It's all 4 you
If you really want it
It's all 4 you
If you say you need it
It's all 4 you
If you gotta have it
It's all 4 you if you make a move
It's all 4 you
It's all 4 you
Tell me you're the only one
It's all 4 you
Soon we'll be having fun
All 4 you
Come over here and get some
It's all 4 you if you make a move
It's all 4 you
All my girls at the party
Look at that body
Shakin' that thing like you never did see
Got a nice package alright
'Cuz I'm gonna have to ride it tonight
All my girls at the party
Look at that body
Shakin' that thing like you never did see
Got a nice package alright
'Cuz I'm gonna have to ride it tonight
It's all 4 you
If you really want it
It's all 4 you
If you say you need it
It's all 4 you
If you gotta have it
It's all 4 you if you make a move
It's all 4 you
All my girls at the party
