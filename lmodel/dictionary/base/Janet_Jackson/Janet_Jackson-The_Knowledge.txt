<song artist="Janet_Jackson" title="The_Knowledge">
Insight to what's going on
Information keeps us strong
What you don't know can hurt you bad
Take it from me you'll be walkin' around sad
Cryin' for a better day
Until you educate for a better way
So if you wanna be in control
Ya gotta get yourself in the know
Get the knowledge
That you really want
The knowledge
Do you really want
It's the knowledge
What you really want
The knowledge
That you really want
Spreading vise don't believe the hype
You don't find the knowledge in a pipe
Too many lives go up in smoke
It's nice to laugh but don't be the joke
To get over get better
Try to be the possessor
Of the one thing we all need in life
To succeed take my advice
Get the knowledge
That you really want
The knowledge
Do you really want
It's the knowledge
What you really want
The knowledge
That you really want
Prejudice No!
Ignorance No!
Bigotry No!
Illiteracy No!
Listen it's up to everyone
If we're gonna change the way the world is run
The way to start is to rid the children of
Prejudice &amp; ignorance
We've gotta teach our kids to read &amp; write
That's the only way to win this fight for life
Education is the goal so
If you wanna be in the know
get the knowledge
It's the one thing we all need in life
Get the knowledge
That you really want
The knowledge
Do you really want
It's the knowledge
What you really want
The knowledge
That you really want
