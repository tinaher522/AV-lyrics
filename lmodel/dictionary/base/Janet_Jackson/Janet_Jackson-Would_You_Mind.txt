<song artist="Janet_Jackson" title="Would_You_Mind">
Baby would you mind touching me ever so slowly
Your making me quiver
Baby would you mind undressing me
Making me feel sexy
While in the moment
Cause I'm gonna bathe you play with you rub you caress you
Tell you how much I've missed you
I just wanna touch you tease you lick you please you
Yove you hold you make love to you
And I'm gonna kiss you suck you taste you ride you
Feel you deep inside me ooh
I just wanna kiss you suck you taste you ride you
Feel you make you come too
Baby would you mind kissing me
All over my body
U missed a spot, there
Baby would you mind tasting me
Its making me all juicy
Feeling your lips on mine
Repeat Chorus
Baby would you mind coming inside of me
Letting your juices free
Deep in my passion
Repeat Chorus
