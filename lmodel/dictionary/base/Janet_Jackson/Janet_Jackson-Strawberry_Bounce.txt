Lose Control  (x2)
Ooh baby
Let me be your playground
Push it out and catch it on the rebound
Turn it out swinging from this pole

Gyrate then spin it like a yo-yo
Slap the back &amp; jiggle it like jell-o

Bump the beat
Just watch the way I pump it
The way I work it's gonna keep you cumin'
Do a dance that's so sensual
I'ma make you
Lose Control 
Don't trip 
You know you wanna watch this

Gonna leave you beggin' for more

My lips are sweet as honey 
When I put it in your face 
Gonna make you spend ya money 
Uh-huh
Come on or you're gonna miss it
Ding dong don't you wanna kiss it 
Watchin' me

Makin' you so horny
If you want a little taste
Gotta show me how much you want it 
I'm bout to 
Pop it
Bounce bounce

Lose Control
I did a tease
To bring you to yo knees baby
(Ohhh)
Broke it down and
Made you feel sleezy
Then you said.... ooh
"You fine muthafucka, I like it, I like it" 
Lose control  (x2)
