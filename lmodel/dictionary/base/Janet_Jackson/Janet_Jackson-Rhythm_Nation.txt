<song artist="Janet_Jackson" title="Rhythm_Nation">
With music by our side
To break the color lines
Let's work together
To improve our way of life
Join voices in protest
To social injustice
A generation full of courage
Come forth with me
People of the world today
Are we looking for a better way of life?
We are a part of the rhythm nation
People of the world unite strength in numbers
We can get it right one time
We are a part of the rhythm nation
This is the test
No struggle no progress
Lend a hand to help
Your brother do his best
Things are getting worse
We have to make them better
It's time to give a damn
Let's work together come on now
People of the world today
Are we looking for a better way of life?
We are a part of the rhythm nation
People of the world unite strength in numbers
We can get it right one time
We are a part of the rhythm nation
People of the world today
Are we looking for a better way of life?
We are a part of the rhythm nation
People of the world unite strength in numbers
We can get it right one time
We are a part of the rhythm nation
Rhythm nation
(Sing it people, say it children)
(Sing it if you want a better way of life)
Rhythm nation
(Sing it people, say it children)
(Sing it if you want a better way of life)
Everybody sing
People of the world today
Are we looking for a better way of life?
We are a part of the rhythm nation
People of the world unite strength in numbers
We can get it right one time
We are a part of the rhythm nation
People of the world today
Are we looking for a better way of life?
We are a part of the rhythm nation
People of the world unite strength in numbers
We can get it right one time
We are a part of the rhythm nation
Rhythm nation, rhythm nation
Rhythm nation, rhythm nation
Rhythm nation, rhythm nation
Rhythm nation
