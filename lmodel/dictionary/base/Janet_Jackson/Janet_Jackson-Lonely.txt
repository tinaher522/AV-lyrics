<song artist="Janet_Jackson" title="Lonely">
Feeling so alone and deserted
With people standing all around you
Should I trust someone
Should I stay off to myself
Alone with no one to talk to
It's such a helpless feeling
So anytime you feel the need
Call me when you're lonely
Cause everybody needs a friend
To be there when they're lonely
So don't isolate yourself
Every time that I come around
A person all alone
Is an unhappy one
We need somebody near to love us
Someone who cares
Living life all by yourselves
Impossible to do and I'll be there for you
Anytime you feel the need
Call me when you're lonely
Cause everybody needs a friend
And I'll be yours if you're lonely
(And if you're all alone)
If you're all alone
And a friend you need
Like a river flows
You hurt, I'll bleed
If you can trust in me
We can find a way
Take away the pain
Time heals all things
Even a lonely state of mind
'cause happiness is oh so hard to find
If you're lonely I will be there
So anytime you feel the need
Call me when you're lonely
Cause everybody needs a friend
To be there when they're lonely
