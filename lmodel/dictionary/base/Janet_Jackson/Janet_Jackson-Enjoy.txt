<song artist="Janet_Jackson" title="Enjoy">
Wake up 7 am
Bout time we do it again
Sushine today
I better make plans
Cause it rained yesterday
But that was ok
Cant complain
I love it either way
Living everyday like it's my last
I refuse to be stuck in the past
People actin like machines
Cause they're scared to live their dreams
No not me
I just enjoy and celebrate
Enjoy the love we make
Enjoy, appreciate
Enjoy
Just keep on doing it
'Til my hearts content
And enjoy when someone smiles
Enjoy
So just enjoy the simple things
Enjoy the day life brings
Enjoy the song love sings
Enjoy
Just keep on doing it
'Til your hearts content
And enjoy the gift of life
Enjoy
If you wanna find the paradise
Do it now never too late to try
Lose your inhibitions
Let your inspiration set you free
And just enjoy and celebrate
Enjoy the love we make
Enjoy, appreciate
Enjoy
Just keep on doing it
'Til my hearts content
And enjoy when someone smiles
Enjoy
So let's enjoy the simple things
Enjoy the day life brings
Enjoy the song love sings
Enjoy
Just keep on doing it
'Til your hearts content
And enjoy the gift of life
Enjoy
And the people say
Enjoy la la la la la [Repeat]
I just enjoy and celebrate
Enjoy the love we make
Enjoy, appreciate
Enjoy
Just keep on doing it
'Til my hearts content
And enjoy when someone smiles
Enjoy
So just enjoy the simple things
Enjoy the day life brings
Enjoy the song love sings
Enjoy
Just keep on doing it
'Til your hearts content
And enjoy the gift of life
Enjoy
Enjoy la la la la la [Repeat]
