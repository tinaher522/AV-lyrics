<song artist="Janet_Jackson" title="Thinkin'_'Bout_My_Ex">
When I first met you
I swear that I was straight with you
I wasn't lookin' for nobody new
I just needed someone to talk to
You said you were cool and understood
But now you caught feelings like I knew you would
And you sittin' there with a broken heart
'Cause I gave you my body and not my heart
When I'm holding you late at night, I'm thinkin' 'bout my ex
When I'm kissing you and look at you, I'm thinkin' 'bout my ex
And I'm sorry, I didn't mean to hurt you
And I know sorry doesn't mend your broken heart
Baby I have to be unselfish and true to me
'Cause I'm not where I really wanna be
And it's nothing with you, it's all me
I toss and turn all night when I sleep
Wantin' and reachin' for someone who used to be
I said it must be some kinda karma thing
'Cause I can't seem to let go love again
When I lay with you I close my eyes, I'm thinkin' 'bout my ex
When I'm touchin' you gently, I'm thinkin' 'bout my ex
And I'm sorry I didn't mean to hurt you
And I know sorry doesn't mend your broken heart
When I'm listenin' to music, I'm thinking' bout my ex
In a bubble bath with the candles lit, I'm thinking 'bout my ex
And I'm sorry I didn't mean to hurt you
And I know sorry doesn't mend your broken heart
You're beautiful, I don't wanna take the space from someone else
So let me go and do a little soul searchin' for myself
I'm sorry that, I pulled you in and let it get this far
You know I never meant to break your heart
At the shopping mall or movies, I'm thinkin' 'bout my ex
At the restaurant while I'm eating, I'm thinkin' 'bout my ex
And I'm sorry I didn't mean to hurt you
And I know sorry doesn't mend your broken heart
While you talk to me I drift away, I'm thinkin' 'bout my ex
When you ask me what I'm thinkin', I'm thinkin' 'bout my ex
And I'm sorry I didn't mean to hurt you
And I know sorry doesn't mend your broken heart
At the shopping mall or movies, I'm thinkin' 'bout my ex
At the restaurant while I'm eating, I'm thinkin' 'bout my ex
And I'm sorry I didn't mean to hurt you
And I know sorry doesn't mend your broken heart
