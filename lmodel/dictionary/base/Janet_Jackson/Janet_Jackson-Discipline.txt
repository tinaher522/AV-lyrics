<song artist="Janet_Jackson" title="Discipline">
I misbehaved, done some things I know I shouldn't do
I touched myself, even though you told me not to
you commanded me to wait for you I tried
But I can smell you on my sheets
Taste you on my skin so vividly
Daddy I disobeyed you
Now I want you to come punish me
Babe I need some discipline tonight
Don't hold back
I've been very bad
Make me cry
Oooo...
Got to make me cry
Oooo...
Babe
[2x]
Oh... misbehaved
And my punishment should fit my crime
Tie me to something
Take off all my clothes
Daddy I want you to take your time (I'm scared)
My heart is beating fast
Shiver as you grab my neck
Baby, blindfold me Daddy
Is better when I don't know what to expect
Babe I need some discipline tonight
Baby Don't hold back
I've been very bad
Oooo...
Daddy Make me cry
Oooo...
Got to make me cry
Oooo...
Babe
[2x]
Did I upset you Daddy
Take out your frustrations on me
Did I make you mad
Take out your frustrations on me
you be the teacher I'll be the student
Tell me to do it, and I will do it
I'm under your command
you be the teacher I'll be the student
Tell me to do it, and I will do it
Babe I need some discipline tonight
Baby don't hold back
I've been very bad
Oooo...
Daddy make me cry
Oooo...
Daddy to make me cry
Babe
Take out your frustrations on me
Take out your frustrations on me
Take out your frustrations on me
