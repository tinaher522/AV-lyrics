<song artist="Janet_Jackson" title="You_Ain't_Right">
Took myself on to the doctor wasn't feeling fine
I had a fever 104
Oh that blew my mind
Must be I had enough
'Bout to explode from the gossip I said
Thought my friend had my back
Just to stab oh yeah
Hurts so bad when I talk
Wanna take something
Numb the pain I know it ain't right
Come face to face with her
Gotta tell her how I feel inside 
Ooh hoo you ain't right
Ooh hoo sick and tired
Yeah yeah yeah yeah 
The doctor said he'd give me something
And I'd be alright
I still feel queezy, feel uneasy
No more drugs for me
Friendships I cherish oh
Let very few in the circle I said
These walls I don't let down
Not very easily
Some friends you grow old with
And they'll be there 'til the very end
I do believe that
But not with her like I thought 
Let her in and I'll get stabbed again 
Ooh hoo you ain't right 
Ooh hoo sick and tired 
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
