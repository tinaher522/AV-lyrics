<song artist="Janet_Jackson" title="(Outro)_20_Part_5">
Twenty years
Time flashes by like lightning in the sky
Twenty years of questions come down to 'Who am I?'
Thank you God for giving us all this sense of humor
All right, it's ten to six
You've gotta go, 'cause I've gotta go
Oh, now she's throwin' me out now that she had her little say
We have some lovely parting gifts for you Lynette
Thanks for coming down
Oh, she tryin' to shut me up
Do do do
Bonus
