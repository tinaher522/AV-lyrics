<song artist="Janet_Jackson" title="Forever_Yours">
All that we've been through
It deepens the love that I feel for you
And with each passing day
The love that I feel makes me wanna say
When time passes no more
You can count on me to always be forever yours
I'll stay forever yours
Nothing can change my love
Nothing can change my love
(Forever yours)
Just like the ancient winds
They started, but never had an end
Just think of my love that way
As one through the years we're gonna stay
And oh, just one more thing
You can count on me to always be forever yours
I'll stay forever yours
No one can love you more
No one can love you more
Love, I have no fear
Just knowin' that you're near
Our love has all the signs
That we'll endure time
Baby, I love you so
Just can't imagine letting go
Without you nothing can be
You are the breath inside of me
And if the ocean ran dry
Don't you know, baby
That you could count on me to
Always be forever yours
