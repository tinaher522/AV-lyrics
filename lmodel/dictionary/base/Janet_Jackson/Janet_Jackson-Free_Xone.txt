<song artist="Janet_Jackson" title="Free_Xone">
He was on the airplane
Sittin' next to this guy
Said he wasn't too shy
And he seemed real nice
Until he found out he was gay
That's so not mellow
Let's get free
Let's get free
Let's get free
Now make it mellow
Now make it mellow
Free style
Xone one
Boy meets boy
Boy loses boy
Boy gets cute boy back
Girl meets girl
Girl loses girl
Girl gets cute girl back
One rule
No rules
One love
Free xone
Let's get free
Let's get free
Let's get free
Now make it mellow
Now make it mellow
Free style
Xone two
Boy meets girl
Boy loses girl
Boy gets cute girl back
Girl meets boy
Girl loses boy
Girl gets cute girl back
Free to be
Who you really are
One rule
No rules
One love
Free xone
Let's get free
Let's get free
Let's get free
Let's get, let's get, let's get free
Let's get free
Now make it mellow
Now make it mellow
Free style
Xone three
Love your sister
Love your brother
Love yourself
Remember
One rule
No rules
One love
Free xone
Free xone
Free xone
One rule
No rules
One love
Free xone
Free xone
Free xone
