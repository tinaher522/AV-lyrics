<song artist="Janet_Jackson" title="The_Magic_Is_Working">
The magic is working, I'm falling in love
The magic is working, I'm falling in love
The magic is working, I'm falling in love
You were sent from heaven above
All of my life
I hoped to find someone like you
So sweet and so kind
Never thought I'd love again
Thought my life had come to an end
And out of the blue
There you were filling my heart
You captured me and
Stood there like a knight in shining armor
You changed my life (you changed my life)
You're such a charmer
The magic is working, I'm falling in love
The magic is working, I'm falling in love
The magic is working, I'm falling in love
You were sent from heaven above
(You must have stepped out of magic)
Stepped right of out of my dream
Shoot through my life with everything
Never have I felt so strong desire
When I'm with you, I can feel the fire
I've never been in love like this
Fireworks in every kiss
Feels so good, I feel alive
My heart and soul, have been revived
The magic is working, I'm falling in love
The magic is working, I'm falling in love
The magic is working, I'm falling in love
You were sent from heaven above
You stood like a knight in shining armor 
You changed my life
You changed my life
You're such a charmer 
(I want you to know)
The magic is working, I'm falling in love
The magic is working, I'm falling in love
The magic is working, I'm falling in love
You were sent from heaven above
The magic is working, baby
I feel so good about your lovin', baby
I feel so good about your lovin', baby
I feel so good about your lovin', baby
