<song artist="Janet_Jackson" title="Rope_Burn">
Mmm. . .my lips hurt
Mmm
Uhh
Oooh
Uhh-ooh
Ooh
Uhh
Ooh
Oh
[CHORUS:]
(tie me)
Tie me up, tie me down
(make me moan real loud)
Make me moan real loud
(take off my clothes)
Take off my clothes
No one has to know
Whisperin I wanna feel a soft rope burn
(no one has to know)
Wanna feel a
Rope burn
When you walked into the room you knew just what to do
Ya coulda gone from door to door but you knew just where to go to
Come into my velvet room and tell me your fantasies
(tell me your fantasies)
The passion in your voice I wanna hear as you start to tell me
While you take the blindfold and tie it gently on me
Don't wanna see but feel the things you're gonna do to me
(wanna feel it)
[CHORUS]
One in the mornin I'm feelin so free and sensual
Lyin here wearin just my imagination for you
Sensation will do
Can you feel the warmth of the fire
Candlelight embrace your body
I'm feelin the hot candle wax drippin down the small of my back
You wanna know what my tongue feels like?
Mmhmm
You like that?
[CHORUS (2x)]
