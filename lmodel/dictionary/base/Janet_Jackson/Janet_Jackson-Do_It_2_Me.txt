<song artist="Janet_Jackson" title="Do_It_2_Me">
Now you can bounce with me, wit me, wit me
Can you, can you, lean wit it, rock wit it
Can you, can you, can you, do it, do it, do it wit me
Can you, can you, can you bounce wit me, wit me, wit me
Come on
It's ain't that often but I do get lonely
And I need someone who can pull through
Not anybody when I need a solid
My first and only call is to you
Time after time babe and throughout my life
It's better cause ya never have
Let me down
I need you all night baby
You know I'll make it alright so
Come do your job tonight
You got me hot tonight
Watch wat'cha doing we ain't moving till
You get it right
Come on and handle this
Skip all that hit or miss
If you gone do it take ya time
So you can do it 2 me right
I need it in slow motion now
I need you to do it 2 me, do it 2 me
Just a little bit faster now
Oohh do it 2 me, do it 2 me
There are no boundaries
To what we'll do
Now that I've laid the foundation
You don't need my direction
Just give me that affection
You know how to serve it
Turn up the music to drown out the screams
If you still hear me
Baby work it out
Don't let it go
Don't let it go
Don't let it go
You're the bomb I'm bout to
Let it go
I need you all night baby
You know I'll make it alright so
Come do your job tonight
You got me hot tonight
Watch wat'cha doing we ain't moving till
You get it right
Come on and handle this
Skip all that hit or miss
If you gone do it take ya time
So you can do it 2 me right
Now won't you move in a circle now
Come on, do it 2 me, do it 2me
A little back n' forth action now
Ooh do it 2 me, do it 2 me
Come do your job tonight
You got me hot tonight
Watch wat'cha doing we ain't moving till
You get it right
Come on and handle this
Skip all that hit or miss
If you gone do it take ya time
So you can do it 2 me right
Go a little bit deeper
Ooh, do it 2 me, do it 2 me
Give it everything you got now
Come on, do it 2 me, do it 2 me
With you it's whatever your pleasure is
To give me pleasure that's why I call on you
Come do your job tonight
You got me hot tonight
Watch wat'cha doing we ain't moving till
You get it right
Come on and handle this
Skip all that hit or miss
If you gone do it take ya time
So you can do it 2 me right
I need a little bit more
Come on, do it 2 me
Ooh, take it like it's yours
Do it 2 me, do it 2 me
Come do your job tonight
You got me hot tonight
Watch wat'cha doing we ain't moving till
You get it right
Come on and handle this
Skip all that hit or miss
If you gone do it take ya time
So you can do it 2 me right
With you it's whatever your pleasure is
To give me pleasure that's why I call on you
