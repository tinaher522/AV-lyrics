Yeah
C'mon
You're missing me
I'm missing you
Whenever we meet
We ain't gonna get no sleep
When I get to be together with you
'Cause we are complete
We ain't gonna get no sleep
A vision rolling round in my head
But I don't really talk about it
I'm lovin' what you're doing to me
And I don't wanna do without it
Day to night, I dream of us doing whatever
But I guess I'll have to wait until that day comes
You're missing me
I'm missing you
Whenever we meet
We ain't gonna get no sleep
When I get to be together with you
'Cause we are complete
We ain't gonna get no sleep
48 hours of love
It's gonna be a weekend marathon
So you better get ready, my king
Cause Imma be the queen of insomnia
Stay wide-awake
For every moment we spend together
'Cause every second you're away
Feels like forever
You're missing me
I'm missing you
Whenever we meet
We ain't gonna get no sleep
When I get to be together with you
'Cause we are complete
We ain't gonna get no sleep
You're missing me
I'm missing you
Whenever we meet
We ain't gonna get no sleep
When I get to be together with you
'Cause we are complete
We ain't gonna get no sleep
Don't have time to sleep but we can dream
So think outside the box, my baby
Show me how much you are missing me
I'll read between the lines
Every time I sure hope it rains
Plush
We ain't gonna get no sleep
We ain't gonna get no sleep
We ain't gonna get no sleep
