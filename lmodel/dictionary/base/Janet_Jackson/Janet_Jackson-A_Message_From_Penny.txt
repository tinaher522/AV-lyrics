<song artist="Janet_Jackson" title="A_Message_From_Penny">
Hello? 
Are you there? 
Hello hello hello!
See meth, see that's exactly what I'm talking about.
You ask me to call you...and you can't even answer the phone.
You may be mr. meth, ok? 
But I'm miss jackson and you ain't done shit for me lately! (laughs)
But you know I love you anyway.
So give me a call.
It's me, janet.
Bye.
