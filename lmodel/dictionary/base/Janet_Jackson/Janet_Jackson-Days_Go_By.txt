<song artist="Janet_Jackson" title="Days_Go_By">
Cuz seconds feel like hours when you're gone, from me
Baby even though
You were just by my side
I'm so missin' you (yeah, yeah)
And I know that I have ya to myself
When you come home
And it seems like days go by
It feels like I'm so lost without you
And I don't really know what to do
The hands of time
Won't move when I'm away from you
And I don't really know what to do
I try to wait patiently
But everything is taking way too long
And I, I just wanna be with you
I'm trying to see it through
It's not fair
Don't wanna be alone another day
It's just too miserable
It's true
And baby I have fluttered
When you're far away
Time stands still
And it seems like days go by
It feels like I'm so lost without you
And I don't really know what to do
The hands of time
Won't move when I'm away from you
And I don't really know what to do
And it seems like days go by
It feels like I'm so lost without you
And I don't really know what to do
The hands of time
Won't move when I'm away from you
And I don't really know what to do
(Musical break and vocalizing)
And it seems like days go by
It feels like I'm so lost without you
And I don't really know what to do
The hands of time
Won't move when I'm away from you
And I don't really know what to do
And it seems like days go by
It feels like I'm so lost without you
And I don't really know what to do
The hands of time
Won't move when I'm away from you
And I don't really know what to do
