<song artist="Janet_Jackson" title="Nasty_Boys">
Gimme a beat
Sittin' in the movie show
Thinkin' nasty thoughts
Better be a gentlemen
Or you turn me off
That's right, a-let me tell it
Nasty, nasty boys, don't mean a thing
Oh, you nasty boys
Nasty, nasty boys, don't ever change
Oh, you nasty boys
I don't like no nasty car
I don't like a nasty food
The only nasty thing I like
Is the nasty groove
Will this one do? Uh huh, I know
Nasty, nasty boys, don't mean a thing
Oh, you nasty boys
Nasty, nasty boys, don't ever change
Oh, you nasty boys
Nasty, nasty boys, give me your nasty groove
Oh, you nasty boys
Nasty, nasty boys, let me see your nasty body move
Oh, you nasty boys
I could learn to like this
Listen up
I'm not a prude
(No)
I just want some respect
(That's right)
So, close the door if you want me to respond
(Ooh, ooh, yeah)
'Cause privacy is my middle name
My last name is Control
No my first name ain't baby
It's Janet, Miss Jackson if you're nasty
Nasty, nasty boys, don't mean a thing
Oh, you nasty boys
Nasty, nasty boys, don't ever change
Oh, you nasty boys
Nasty boys, don't mean a thing
Oh, you nasty boys
Don't mean a thing to me
Nasty
Don't mean a thing
Oh, you nasty boys
I love this part
Hey, who's that thinkin' nasty thoughts?
Nasty boys
Who's that in that nasty car?
Nasty boys
Who's that eating that nasty food?
Nasty boys
Who's jamming to my nasty groove?
Nasty boys
Ladies
(Nasty boys)
Don't mean a thing
Oh, you nasty boys
