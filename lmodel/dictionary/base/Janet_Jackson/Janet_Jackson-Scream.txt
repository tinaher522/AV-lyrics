<song artist="Janet_Jackson" title="Scream">
(Duet with Michael Jackson)
Michael:
Tired of injustice
Tired of the schemes
Kinda disgusted
So what does it mean
Kicking me down
I got to get up
As jacked as it sounds
The whole system sucks, damnit
Janet:
Peek in the shadow
Come into the light
You tell me I'm wrong
Then you better prove you're right
You're sellin' out souls but
I care about mine
I've got to get stronger
And I won't give up the fight
Michael:
With such confusions don't it make you wanna scream
Your bash abusin' victimize within the scheme
Janet:
You try to cope with every lie they scrutinize
Both:
Somebody please have mercy
'cause I just can't take it
Chorus:
Stop pressurin' me, just stop pressurin' me
Stop pressurin' me, make me wanna scream
Stop pressurin' me, just stop pressurin' me
Stop pressurin' me, make me wanna scream
Michael:
Tired of you tellin' the story your way
It's causin' confusion
You think it's okay
Janet:
Keep changin' the rules
While you're playin' the game
I can't take it much longer
I think I might go insane
Michael:
With such confusion don't it make you wanna scream
Your bash abusin' victimize within the scheme
Janet:
You find your pleasure scandalizin' every lie
Both:
Oh father, please have mercy 'cause
I just can't take it
Chorus 2:
Stop pressurin' me, just stop pressurin' me
Stop pressurin' me, make me wanna scream
Stop pressurin' me, just stop fuckin' with me
Stop pressurin' me, make me wanna scream
Janet:
"Oh my God, can't believe what I saw
As I turned on the TV this evening
I was disgusted by all the injustice
All the injustice"
Michael:
"All the injustice"
News Man:
"A man has been brutally beaten to death by
Police after being wrongly identified as a
robbery suspect. The man was
an 18 year old black male..."
Michael:
With such collusions don't it make you wanna scream
Your bash abusin' victimize' within the scheme
Janet:
You try to cope with every lie they scrutinize
Both:
Oh brother please have mercy
'cause I just can't take it
Repeat Chorus
Repeat Chorus 2
Repeat Chorus
