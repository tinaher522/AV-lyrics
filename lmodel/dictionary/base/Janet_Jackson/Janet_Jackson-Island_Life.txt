<song artist="Janet_Jackson" title="Island_Life">
Come into this sacred and erotic dream
It's a world I know you wanna share
Baby, let's indulge in things that set our bodies free
Promise me that you will meet me there 
What better way (better way)
Than to wind down (wind down)
On streets paved in harmony
I like the sexy sounds (sexy sounds) 
From the DJ (from the DJ)
Damn I think he's spinning this one for me 
Island in the sun
Just you and I will go
Ride into the wave like echo
When I hear that song 
I wanna be with you
Headed for the nightlife echo 
Close my eyes and there you are in front of me
Takin' me to where I wanna go
Baby, from my little shop of curiosities
Boy I'll show you all you need to know
Come on baby 
What better way (better way)
Than to wind down (wind down)
On streets paved in harmony
I like the sexy sounds (sexy sounds) 
From the DJ (from the DJ)
Damn I think he's spinning this one for me 
Island in the sun
Just you and I will go
Ride into the wave like echo
When I hear that song 
I wanna be with you
Headed for the nightlife echo 
What better way (better way)
Than to wind down (wind down)
On streets paved in harmony
I like the sexy sounds (sexy sounds) 
From the DJ (from the DJ)
Damn I think he's spinning this one for me 
(This one's for me)
Island in the sun 
(Island in the)
Just you and I will go
(Just you and I)
Ride into the wave like echo
(Ride a wave...like echo)
When I hear that song 
(When I hear)
I wanna be with you
(Be with you)
Headed for the nightlife echo 
(Ohhh island life that's so)
Island in the sun
(Just you and I will go)
Just you and I will go
(Into the wave...into the wave)
Ride into the wave like echo
(Like echo baby)
When I hear that song 
(When I hear that song)
I wanna be with you
(Wanna be with you)
Headed for the nightlife echo 
(Ohhhh)
Island life, sunshine, and paradise
All night I wanna give it to you
Island life, sunshine, and paradise
Everynight I'm gonna give it to you
(Gimmee the high life)
Island life, sunshine, and paradise
All night I wanna give it to you
(Gimmee the good life)
Island life, sunshine, and paradise
Everynight I'm gonna give it to you
(Gimmee the high life)
(Gimmee the good life)
(Gimmee the good life)
(Gimmee the good life)
