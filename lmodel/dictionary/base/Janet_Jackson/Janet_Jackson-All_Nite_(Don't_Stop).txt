This is sick
Attention, it's time to danceâ€¦
Work it like you're workin' a pole
Shake it 'til you're shakin' the floor
Pop it like you're poppin' a cork
(Ohhh)
Don't stop, don't stop
Jerk it like you're makin' it choke
(Like that)
Break it like you're breakin' a code
(Like that)
Drop it 'til you're takin' it lower
(Like that)
Drop it, drop it
This is serious 
I'm delirious (C'mon)
So oblivious (Oowoo)
I could dance all night 
With you 
As long as it funky (funky...funky)
This rhythm just makes me high
I'm like a junkie 
I could dance all night 
Work it like you're workin' a pole
Shake it 'til you're shakin' the floor
Pop it like you're poppin' a cork
(Ohhh)
Don't stop, don't stop
Jerk it like you're makin' it choke
(Like that)
Break it like you're breakin' a code
(Like that)
Drop it 'til you're takin' it lower
(Like that)
I could dance all night
Ohh
(Like that)
(Like that)
Don't stop don't stop
So intoxicated
I'm so stimulated
Feel so X-rated
I could dance all night 
As long as it's funky (funky...funky)
This rhythm just makes me high
I'm like a junkie 
I could dance all night
Work it like you're workin' a pole
Shake it 'til you're shakin' the floor
Pop it like you're poppin' a cork
(Ohhh)
Don't stop, don't stop
Jerk it like you're makin' it choke
(Like that)
Break it like you're breakin' a code
(Like that)
Drop it 'til you're takin' it lower
(Like that)
I could dance all night
Everybody on the floor (Let's go)
Let's get hardcore (Get low)
Make my sweat pour (Oh no)
Don't stop (Gimmee some more)
Ooh my body's yours (Spank that)
Spank that back door (Like that)
Drive me like a Porsche (ooh yeah) 
I could dance all night 
Can we take this party higher (C'mon...yeah)
Now just put your hands to the sky and 
Clap it up clap it up
Don't stop don't stop 
I could dance all night 
Work it like you're workin' a pole
(Like that)
Shake it 'til you're shakin' the floor
(Like that)
Pop it like you're poppin' a cork
(Ohhh)
Don't stop, don't stop
Jerk it like you're makin' it choke
(Like that)
Break it like you're breakin' a code
(Like that)
Drop it 'til you're takin' it lower
(Like that)
I could dance all night
Work it like you're workin' a pole
(Like that)
Shake it 'til you're shakin' the floor
(Like that)
Pop it like you're poppin' a cork
(Ohhh)
Don't stop, don't stop
Jerk it like you're makin' it choke
(Like that)
Break it like you're breakin' a code
(Like that)
Drop it 'til you're takin' it lower
(Like that)
Don't stop don't stop
