<song artist="Janet_Jackson" title="My_Need">
My love, my need
Tonight, I feel so tight
My love, my need
Tonight, just how I like
I know, you know
What exactly's on my mind
I can't help mMyself
Part of how I feel tonight
Won't make excuses
I just want you inside baby
We don't need to
Talk about no promises
My love, my need
Tonight, I feel so tight
My love, my need
Tonight, just how I like
Let's just pretend
That we have no more tomorrow
Can't we make love
Like it's our last time baby
Let's not get too
Soft and gentle with it 'cause I
Am not feelin'
In no mood to play about
My love, my need
Tonight, I feel so tight
My love, my need
Tonight, just how I like
I need you like the flowers need the rain
I need you like the blues needs the pain
I need you like the stars need the night
I need you like the waves need the sea
My love, my need
Tonight, I feel so tight
My love, my need
Tonight, just how I like
I need you like the flowers need the rain
I need you like the blues needs the pain
I need you like the stars need the night
I need you like the waves need the sea
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
I need you like the flowers need the rain
I need you like the blues needs the pain
I need you like the stars need the night
I need you like the waves need the sea
