<song artist="Janet_Jackson" title="Tonight's_The_Night">
This is just between me
And you
And you
Stay away
From my window
Stay away
From my back door too
Disconnect
The telephone line
Relax baby
And draw that blind
Kick off your shoes
And sit right down
Loosen up the back
Of your pretty French gown, yeah
Let me pour you
A good long drink
Ooh baby
Dontcha hesitate
Tonight's the night
It's gonna be alright
Cuz I love you girl
Ain't nobody gonna stop us now
Come on angel
My heart's on fire
Don't deny
This one desire
You'd be a fool
To stop this time
Spread your wings and let me
Come inside cuz
Don't say a word
My virgin child
Just let your
Inhibitions run wild
The secret is
About to unfold
Upstairs
Before the night's too old cuz
Tonight
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
It's gonna be alright
Cuz I love you boy
Ain't nobody gonna stop us now
This is so special
Tonight's the night
Don't be afraid
You know I'm gonna make it alright
Tonight's the night
Don't be afraid
I'm gonna make things alright
Tonight's the night
Don't be afraid
You know I'm gonna make it alright
Tonight's the night
Don't be afraid
I'm gonna make things alright
Tonight's the night
Don't be afraid
Please don't leave
I don't wanna be left all alone
