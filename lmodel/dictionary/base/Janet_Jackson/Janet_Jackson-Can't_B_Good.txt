<song artist="Janet_Jackson" title="Can't_B_Good">
I can't believe I let this happen to me
It always ends up not good
That's why I know this can't be good
Open my eyes 
First thing I see
Your lovely smile 
Smiling at me
Kiss my forehead 
Up out of bed
Off to start your day 
Here in bed I stay
Thinking bout last night 
Be playing in my mind
When you touch me there
Ooh ooh it feels so right
Then interscinds
What am I doin
Get up out of bed
To myself thinkin
This can't be good, This can't be good, This can't be good
This can't be good, This can't be good, This can't be good
What's goin on 
What's happening to me
Promised myself 
I would never let this be
Never again, never that way
Cut me so deep that I havent' been the same
What I feel right now, I felt before
When I hear your name
And my fellins are floored
I'll fight it if I can
But I don't know if I should
The one thing I know
This can't be good babe
Oh I thing I'm falling in love again
Told myself I never would
Ii think I'm falling in love again
This can not be good.
