<song artist="Janet_Jackson" title="20_(Intro)">
Well there's something to...
Are you recording?
There's something to be said for not saying anything
I've talked about racism, spousal abuse, empowering women, children
I've talked about a lot of things
What do I talk about this time?
I've covered a lot in my 20 years
And I've uncovered a lot in my 20 years
But I wanna keep it light
I don't wanna be serious
I wanna have fun
I know
I don't know
That's what I do know
