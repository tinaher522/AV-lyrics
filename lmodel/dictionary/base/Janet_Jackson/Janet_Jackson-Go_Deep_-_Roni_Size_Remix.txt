<song artist="Janet_Jackson" title="Go_Deep_-_Roni_Size_Remix">
We go deep and we don't get no sleep
'Cause we be up all night until the early light
We go deep and we don't get no sleep
'Cause we be up all night until the early light
I'm feelin' fine 'cause in time I'll be out tonight
I'm startin' now, makin' sure I look fine tonight
Call Rene and Boo, gotta meet them soon
Tell T to call Shawn, I'll be here at 1 'o clock
When we show up, all the guys at the club
Wanna get our backs, we look good in black
We go deep and we don't get no sleep
'Cause we be up all night until the early light
We go deep and we don't get no sleep
'Cause we be up all night until the early light
I'm feelin' high 'cause I'm outta control tonight
Feelin' high don't wanna stop
He's got me movin', DJ groovin' I feel way right
Groovin' I don't wanna stop
I'm gettin' freaked from behind, I don't even mind
'Cause he lookin' damn fine, make him mine in time
Gotta take him home when I get him alone
I'll make him scream and moan, he won't wanna stop
We go deep and we don't get no sleep
'Cause we be up all night until the early light
We go deep and we don't get no sleep
'Cause we be up all night until the early light
We go deep and we don't get no sleep
'Cause we be up all night until the early light
We go deep and we don't get no sleep
'Cause we be up all night until the early light
I'm feelin' high tonight, outta control tonight
I'm feelin' high tonight, I feel high
We go deep and we don't get no sleep
'Cause we be up all night until the early light
We go deep and we don't get no sleep
'Cause we be up all night until the early light
We go deep and we don't get no sleep
'Cause we be up all night until the early light
We go deep and we don't get no sleep
'Cause we be up all night until the early light
