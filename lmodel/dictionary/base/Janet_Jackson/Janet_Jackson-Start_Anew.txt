<song artist="Janet_Jackson" title="Start_Anew">
I've been so alone
Ain't no fun since you've been gone cryin' on the phone
You're the one
I got to fly to you
I got to get to you somehow
Our love is tried and true
I'm a believer now
I'm still high on you
Now we're through the hardest part
Open your heart, and let's start anew
Let your angel baby bring you a dream
I can't wait now, baby, to spread these wings
(it's only you that can)
Make my grey skies electric blue
Kiss these bad times goodbye and let's start anew
Why'd I let you go say "so long"? 
Thought I was strong (yes I thought I was strong, baby)
Baby now I know, I was wrong. I want to fly to you
Make it up to you somehow
Reach for the sky with you
And never come back down
I'm still high on you
Now we're through the hardest part
Open your heart, and let's start anew
