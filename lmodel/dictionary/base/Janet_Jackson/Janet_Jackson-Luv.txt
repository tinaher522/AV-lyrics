<song artist="Janet_Jackson" title="Luv">
I've been down this road before
I know it very well
And I just can't believe I got struck
I didn't see ya (comin')
Like I was (blindfolded)
I'm caught up in (collision)
And now I'm so done
You crept up like a spider
I got caught in your web
And there was no way to escape
I tried to switch (my lane)
But then I hit (my brakes)
Sparks turned into (flames)
I shoulda stopped at the red light 'cause
Now I'm like a deer caught in headlights
Ugh, he hit me with his love, love, love, love, love
He hit me with his (love)
And now I'm in love, love, love, love
Got me caught in a wreck, I'm a mess
Got me caught in a wreck, I'm a mess
Got me caught in a wreck
Somebody call the paramedics 'cause
He hit me with his love, love, love, love
I was grippin' the road
Just knew I had control
So how did I end up gettin' hit
I had on my (belt)
I checked it (myself)
So how in the (world) did I get caught
I had the right of way (ho hey)
The signs you saw you disobeyed
(It was your fault)
I can't believe the way you impacted my heart
I think I should sue ya
I shoulda stopped at the red light 'cause
Now I'm like a deer caught in headlights
Ugh, he hit me with his love, love, love, love, love
He hit me with his (love)
And now I'm in love, love, love, love
Got me caught in a wreck, I'm a mess
Got me caught in a wreck, I'm a mess
Got me caught in a wreck
Somebody call the paramedics 'cause
He hit me with his love, love, love, love
You caught me by surprise
I can't believe that I'm falling for this guy
Somebody call the cops 'cause I'm going flat line
You caught me by surprise
I can't believe that I'm falling for this guy
Somebody call the cops 'cause I'm going flat line
I shoulda stopped at the red light 'cause
Now I'm like a deer caught in headlights
Ugh, he hit me with his love, love, love, love, love
He hit me with his (love)
And now I'm in love, love, love, love
Got me caught in a wreck, I'm a mess
Got me caught in a wreck, I'm a mess
Got me caught in a wreck
Somebody call the paramedics 'cause
He hit me with his love
He crashed into my heart
He crashed into my heart
Somebody call the paramedics 'cause
He hit me with his love
He crashed into my heart
He crashed into my heart
Somebody call the paramedics 'cause
He hit me with his love
He crashed into my heart
He crashed into my heart
Somebody call the paramedics 'cause
He hit me with his love, love, love, love, love
