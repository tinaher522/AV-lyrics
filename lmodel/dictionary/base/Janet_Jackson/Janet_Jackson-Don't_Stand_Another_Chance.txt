<song artist="Janet_Jackson" title="Don't_Stand_Another_Chance">
Standin' at the edge of time 'bout to lose my mind
'Cause you try to take him away from me, I won't let it be
You just walk into my life and try to take away my only prize
But you better give credit 'cause his love is right here for me
You don't stand another chance
You don't stand another chance
You don't stand another chance
You don't stand another chance
He belongs to me, just wait and see
Take him in my arms, give him love, not too much of me
Nothin' you can do or say to make him look your way
So you better give credit 'cause it's gonna come walking my way
You don't stand another chance
you don't stand another chance (ohh)
You don't stand another chance (you don't stand baby)
You don't stand another chance (you don't stand)
You don't stand another chance
Sit and wait at home 'bout to leave me alone (I know baby)
You'll be with him when he's up, not down, to keep him on the ground
Let me tell you something, it's true, he's not in love with you
So you better give credit 'cause it's nothing coming down your way
You don't stand another chance (not a chance, baby)
You don't stand another chance (you don't stand, baby)
You don't stand another chance (baby) you don't stand another chance (you don't stand)
Well, you know somebody's gotta lose
We all can't win... maybe next time, okay
You guys are confusing
You don't stand another chance (you don't stand)
You don't stand another chance (you don't stand, baby)
You don't stand another chance (you don't stand, baby)
You don't stand another chance (another chance)
