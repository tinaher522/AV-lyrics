<song artist="Janet_Jackson" title="What's_Ur_Name">
Hold up
Slow it down
I can see you new in town
Cuz I'd never
Forget you face
That smile you wear
Is amazin
Just wanna know
Where you headed
I could roll
Wit you baby
Make some room
In your life
I don't wanna take up time
So baby what's your name
What's your name babe
Do you live around here
Cuz I ain't never seen you before
But I wanna see you some more
What's you name babe
Put it right in my Sidekick
And I'll hit you back
Soon as I get home
I'll put you in
My favorites
The swag you got
Left a print
In my mind
As time goes by
All I can think of is you
Why you gotta be so fly
Wish I could see you again
Got me walkin round
Lookin for you
I'm trippin
Damn what you do to me
Can't believe how you got me and
I don't even know your name
Your not some random guy
I can't let this moment pass me by
I gotta do what I gotta do
Take advantage
Make the first move
Cuz I don't wanna have to regret it
I just wanna know your name
