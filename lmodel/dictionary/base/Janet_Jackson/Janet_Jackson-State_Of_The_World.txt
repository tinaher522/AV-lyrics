<song artist="Janet_Jackson" title="State_Of_The_World">
5 A.M. rise and shine
To feed the baby before he starts to cry
No rest, no time to play
Fifteen, the mother is a runaway
No time for dreams or goals
Pressure is so strong
Her body she has sold so her child can eat
What is happening to this world we live in?
In our home and other lands
Drugs and crime spreadin' on the street
People can't find enough to eat
Now our kids can't go out and play
That's the state of the world today
State of the world (Oooh baby, drugs and crimes)
Lil' Johnny all alone
His only friend, the doll he carries with him
Goes to school each and every day
To be teased because he has no place to stay
This young homeless boy feels his life is worthless
Instead of suicide he cries himself to sleep
And it's happenin' to this world we live in
There's got to be a better way
Drugs and crime spreadin' on the street
People can't find enough to eat
Now our kids can't go out and play
That's the state of the world today
State of the world (Oooooh, t-t-t-today, t-t-t-today, t-t-t-today)
Nation! (t-t-t-t-t-today)
(Drugs and crimes, t-t-t-t-t-today, drugs and crimes, t-t-t-t-today) 
Can't give up hope now
Let's weather the storm together
Drugs and crime spreadin' on the street
People can't find enough to eat
Now our kids can't go out and play
That's the state of the world today 
Drugs and crime spreadin' on the street (Ahhh)
People can't find enough to eat (Ahhh)
Now our kids can't go out and play (Ahhh)
That's the state of the world today (D-d-d-drugs)
Drugs and crime spreadin' on the street (Crime spreading on the streets)
People can't find enough to eat (Starving people)
Now our kids can't go out and play (They can't even walk the street)
That's the state of the world today (I give up, state of the world today)
(Drugs and crime, ahhh ooh, drugs and crime, ahh ooh)
That's the state of the world today
