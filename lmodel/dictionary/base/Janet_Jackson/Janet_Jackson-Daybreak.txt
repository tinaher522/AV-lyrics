<song artist="Janet_Jackson" title="Daybreak">
It's after midnight
And everyones in their room
And I'm just waiting for the lights to go out
But in the mean time
I'm ringin' ringin' your phone
I'm sayin' baby be patient
I have almost escaped to see you
When they fall asleep
I'm gonna be free
Hope nobody wants to stay up too late
Cause I'm
Sneakin out to play tonight
Gonna take a taxi ride
Have fun with you
It feels so good I can't wait
Feels like a minute when I'm with you then
The whole thing has to end
Hurry up get back in bed
Before daybreak
I can't stay inside
I know I saw you last night
But it's already been too long
I need to feel your body
The touch of your body
But that's not all
No that's not all
When I'm around you time gets lost
When they fall asleep
I'm gonna be free
Hope nobody wants to stay up too late
Cause I'm
Sneakin out to play tonight
Gonna take a taxi ride
Have fun with you
It feels so good I can't wait
Feels like a minute when I'm with you then
The whole thing has to end
Hurry up get back in bed
Before daybreak
Sneak down the stairs
Get money for the faire
Time is of the essence
So I'll tell the driver hurry up
I can't sit still
I'm like a little kid
Smilin' 'cause I'll be in your arms in a minute
Times like this I see you
Can't afford to miss
Worth the risk of getting caught
Just to have your kiss
And when I have go (it's the saddest)
But I'm so glad to know
I'll see you tomorrow
When they fall asleep
I'm gonna be free
Hope nobody wants to stay up too late
