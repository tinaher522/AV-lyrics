<song artist="Janet_Jackson" title="Love_Scene">
Love scene (ooh baby)
Ooh baby ooh baby
Ooh baby ooh baby
Ooh baby ooh baby
Ooh baby ooh baby
Lying here
I imagine you with me
On this rainy night
I feel your touch
As your hands move slowly
Up my thighs
You taste the honey
They begun to pour it slowly
Wherever you desire
I feel you play with my body this way
Makes me say
Ooh baby ooh baby
Ooh baby ooh baby
Ooh baby ooh baby
Ooh baby ooh baby
You whisper words
Your fantasies in my ear
You know this I like
Just tell me how
When and where you want me
And I'll eb there
Ooh baby ooh baby
Ooh baby ooh baby
Ooh baby ooh baby
Ooh baby ooh baby
Ooh baby ooh baby
Ooh baby ooh baby
Ooh baby ooh baby
Ooh baby ooh baby
When you're holding me
When you're loving me
When you're fucking me
