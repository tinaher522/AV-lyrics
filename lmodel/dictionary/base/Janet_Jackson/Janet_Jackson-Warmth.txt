<song artist="Janet_Jackson" title="Warmth">
In my mouth
My hands, wrapped around
Strokin', up and down (...down...down)
Is all this for me
But nothing can compare to
(Thank you)
The warmth of my mouth
I love, every sound, you make
When I'm down
(It's so big)
Nothing can prepare you
(Can I taste it)
For the warmth of my
Mouth against your mouth
Getting you aroused
Whisper in your ear
I think I'll take it further south
(Oooohoo)
Kissin' on your neck
Rubbin' on your leg
Slide a little further up
I feel you get erect
(I feel you get erect)
And now we're flesh against flesh
Breathin' on your chest
So anxious to touch it
Oooh, my mouth is getting wet
(Mouth is gettin' wet babe)
Just like the water from the shore
Let your rain pour
Baby brace yourself for
The warmth of my mouth 
My hands, wrapped around
Strokin', up and down 
(Let's see how long you can last inside)
(I know you like it)
But nothing can compare to
(No)
The warmth of my mouth
I love, every sound, (Oh yeah) you make
(mmmhmm)
When I'm down
(Just let the water splash about)
(I know you like it)
Nothing can prepare you
For the warmth of my mouth
There's no place, warmer than my mouth
Start off slow (Start off slow)
(Okay, we're just gonna start off slow)
Circles (Circles)
Then deeper and deep it goes (deeper and deep it goes)
(Oh yeah...you like that...here I go)
Kisses so sensual (Kisses so sensual)
(mmmhmm)
Tasteful
(It taste so good to me)
I love givin' you a show (I love givin' you a show)
(Wait...not yet)
The warmth of my mouth
My hands, wrapped around
Strokin', up and down 
(How much longer can you last)
But nothing can compare to
The warmth of my mouth
I love, every sound, you make
When I'm down (...down...down)
(I feel you getting closer)
Nothing can prepare you (...you...you...you)
For the warmth of my mouth
(mmmhmm...do you like that...or this...mmmhmm)
(Now it's my turn)
