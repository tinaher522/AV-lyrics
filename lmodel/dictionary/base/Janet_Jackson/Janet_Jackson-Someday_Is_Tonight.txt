<song artist="Janet_Jackson" title="Someday_Is_Tonight">
Here we are just you and me
Got something for you baby
Wait and see
No need to worry, come follow me
I don't want you to think about anything else
Tonight
We've been together for quite sometime
Now I know that yout love is mine
No more fantasizing of how it would be
Cause tonight all your dreams come true
Ready to give all my love
Won't hold back
Someday is tonight
Let me make your dreams come true
Don't hold back
Someday is tonight
You know I promised
I'd be worth the wait
Now the wait is over baby
Please don't hesitate
Boy you make me tremble
With your warm caress
I never knew I could feel this way
No more fanasizing
You'll ever have to do
Cause tonight baby
All your dreams come true
I want you so bad I can taste it
I'm yours if you want me
Ready to give all my love
Won't hold back
Someday is tonight
Let me make your dreams come true
Don't hold back
Someday is tonight
