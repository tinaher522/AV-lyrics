A funny thing bout luv we choose
It ain't perfect but we do the best we can
Do U understand
And I luv U more than words can say
Here's to knowin that you'll stay with me
Through the complications
Baby what I'm sayin
I don't wanna give up on our fate
And I don't wanna think that it's too late
So if something is broke
Let me go and fix it
And if something is lost
Let me go and get it 
Cause I don't wanna stand when all is done
And I'll b next to U cause Ur the one
I said it twice
And I'ma say once more Ur the one I want
I'm never gonna lechu go
There are times
When I don't get around to say what I feel like sayin
Nooo
There are times
When it gets so hard I feel like I can't take it
U make me want U
And fight U
Luv U 
And despise U
Still when it feels like I ain't got nothin left
I remind myself that
I don't wanna give up on our fate (No)
And I don't wanna think that it's too late
(So if something is broke)
Let me go and fix it
(And if something is lost)
Let me go and get it
Cause I don't wanna stand when it's all done (I don't wanna)
And I'll b next to U cause Ur the one
I said twice
I'ma say once more Ur the one I want
I'm never gonna lechu go
Whao whao whao whao whao whao
I'm never gonna lechu go
Whao whao whao whao whao whao
Still when it feels like I got nothin left
I remind myself that I don't wanna give up on our fate
And I don't wanna think that it's too late
So if somethings broke
Let me go and fix it
And if something is lost
Let me go and get it (Let me go! Let me go!) 
Cause I don't wanna stand when all is done
And I'll b next to U cause Ur the one
I said twice
And I'ma say once more Ur the one I want
I'm never gonna lechu go
Whao whaowhao ahh ahh
I'm never gonna letchu go
whao whaowhaowhao ahh ahh
