<song artist="Janet_Jackson" title="Who">
I love this
Oh my god
Oops
Uh
Uh
Who
Oops
Chorus:
Who 
Yeah who, I do
I be lovin' who 
Yeah who
Ask who cares about you
I care about you
My love for you has got me goin' crazy
I thought we could possibly maybe
Get together and start something
No other person in this world
Could make me feel like a little shy girl
There's nothing I won't do for you
Bridge:
I'll comfort you, be kind to you
And I'll be strength to you
I'll sing to you, won't cling to you
In everything you do
I'll pamper you, won't hamper you
From all the things you wanna do
I'll care for you, make love to you
And I'll be good to you
I'll brighten you, enlighten you
With every silly mood
I'll fight for you, what's right for you
But all you really gotta know is
Chorus
When I'm around you become such a mess
Your tongue is tied, your weak confess
And it makes my spirit fly every time
Your love for me, I don't wanna change
Even though you can do and say some crazy things
There's nothing in this I wouldn't do for you
Bridge
Chorus (2x)
