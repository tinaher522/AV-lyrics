<song artist="Janet_Jackson" title="Damita_Jo">
Sexy, Quiet
Shy but down for a good time
Taurus, my sign
Like rain, but love the sunshine
Makin' headlines
Feel I'm too deep to define
Simple inside
But I'm livin' the diva life 
Damita Jo
Do you like me
Do u want me
Just for what you see
Damita Jo
Do you think that
I'm that person
You watch on TV
Damita Jo
There's another side
That I don't hide
But might never show
Damita Jo
If you wanna get close
Baby, you can't
Til' U get to know
Damita Jo 
A Friend and a lover
A sista
A freak undercover
I do movies
I do dance
Do music
I love doin' my man
I wanna nasty boy to put it on me good
Ms Janet don't
But Damita sho do
A little lady
A whole lotta class
But do me wrong I'll get in that ass
Damita Jo
Do you like me
Do u want me
Just for what you see
Damita Jo
Do you think that
I'm that person
You watch on TV
Damita Jo
There's another side
That I don't hide
But might never show
Damita Jo
If you wanna get close
Baby, you can't
Til' U get to know
Damita Jo 
Damita Jo
Do you like me
Do u want me
Just for what you see
Damita Jo
Do you think that
I'm that person
You watch on TV
Damita Jo
There's another side
That I don't hide
But might never show
Damita Jo
If you wanna get close
Baby, you can't
Til' U get to know
Ooohh...I'm a tell yo daddy...I'm a tell yo mama...mmhmm...mm mm mm
