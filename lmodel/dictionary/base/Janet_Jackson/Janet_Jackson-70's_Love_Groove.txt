<song artist="Janet_Jackson" title="70's_Love_Groove">
Hey baby
Just let me do all the work
Wait, let me put this record on
Tonight you're all mine
Chorus:
Afros, incense, and black lights
Love beads, mood rings, and candle light
Zodiac says the time is right
For a 70's love groove
Do you like my body?
I've got on what you like
Take your time, we've got all night
70's kinda love... 70's kinda love...
Afros, incense, and black lights
Love beads, mood rings, and candle light
Zodiac says the time is right
For a 70's love groove
Wait, be a good boy and put this on
You know you want me
Tell me, tell me you want me
I want you to tell me what to do
Tell me
70's kinda love... 70's kinda love...
Anything, anything baby
I'll take you places you've never been before
Touch me here, now touch me there
70's kinda love... 70's kinda love...
Afros, incense, and black lights
Love beads, mood rings, and candle light
Zodiac says the time is right
For a 70's love groove
Sensual... just waiting her for you baby
Let me take it out... I love it when you...
70's kinda love... 70's kinda love...
Afros, incense, and black lights
Love beads, mood rings, and candle light
Zodiac says the time is right
For a 70's love groove
Your smooth and shiny
Feels so good against my lips
I want you so bad
I can taste your love right now
You've got me so wet
I want you inside me
