<song artist="Janet_Jackson" title="I'm_Here">
I'm here
You'll never have to be alone
I'm here
Cause all I wanna be is with you
So don't
Think you walk the path alone
Please say
That you want me to be the heart of you
Baby
Here I am
Please let me know
What to do
I don't wanna hear you say your heart is all in knots
Because life has left you without love
And now you're all you got
And you know I don't wanna hear you say
Your wall stands tall of stone
Because love harassed you with pain
You feel you'll grow old alone
Eyes wide open
Tell me what do you see in me
Someone wanting to love you deeply
Won't you let me?
I'm here
You'll never have to be alone
I'm here
Cause all I wanna be is with you
So don't
Think you walk the path alone
Please say
That you want me to be the heart of you
Baby
Here I am
Please let me know
What to do
I don't wanna hear you say
Your heart won't be cherished
An original Picasso masterpiece is what it is
And you know I don't think that
You should say you have something to fear
How could someone share your gladness
And not share in all your tears
Eyes wide open
Tell me what do you see in me
Someone who loves you for you deeply
Why don't you let me?
I'm here
You'll never have to be alone
I'm here
Cause all I wanna be is with you
So don't
Think you walk the path alone
Please say
That you want me to be the heart of you
Baby
Here I am
Please let me know
What to do
Take my hand let love surround you
No more aches inside
Smother you with kisses, laughter, tickles
Through the night
Behind if you like
As my soft lips wonders you all night
I'm here
Chorus
