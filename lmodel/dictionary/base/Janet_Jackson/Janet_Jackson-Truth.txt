<song artist="Janet_Jackson" title="Truth">
How did I get here
Think I know what I did
Always worked real hard 
Maybe I missed something
I'm not into pointing fingers 
Showin who's right or wrong
I just wanna keep it real
Cause maybe I was doin fine on my own
Listen…
I had a career before now didn't I
I had lots of friends before now didn't I
And I had my fans before now didn't I 
And I had my family before now didn't I 
Guess without you
My little life was nothing
But don't sweat it 
Let's say we disagree so
Arguing ain't necessary cause
We both have out whole lives left to live
We're both consumed with jealousy
But the truth can set you free
Don't act like you don't know the truth 
Cause deep down in your heart you do
Let it go
Ooh child
Things are gonna get easier
Ooh child thing will be bright cause
Truth will set you free
Conversations deep 
When you talk to yourself
There's no wayt to cheat
Cause you know you can't be no one else
Won't trip out on disappointment
Cause failure is just not me
Still I gotta do my job
Cause you know my show can't go on without me
Listen…
I had a career before now didn't I
Sold out round the worl before now didn't I
I had a few hits before now didn't I
And danced until my feet were sore now didn't I
Guess without you
My little life was nothing
But don't sweat it 
Let's say we disagree so
Arguing ain't necessary cause
We both have out whole lives left to live
We're both consumed with jealousy
But the truth can set you free
It's hard to believe
The love between us is over
It's sad to think we couldn't work it out
But how much is enough to pay for this mistake
Hope your love was sincere
Don't act like you don't know the truth 
Cause deep down in your heart you do
Let it go
Ooh child
Things are gonna get easier
Ooh child thing will be bright cause
Truth will set you free
Don't act like you don't know the truth 
Cause deep down in your heart you do
Let it go
Ooh child
Things are gonna get easier
Ooh child thing will be bright cause
Truth will set you free
Do you know the truth
Feel it 
Live it
Do you know the truth
Trust it
Believe it
Do you know the truth
You want it
And need it
Do you know the truth
To find it
Embrace it
And never let it go
