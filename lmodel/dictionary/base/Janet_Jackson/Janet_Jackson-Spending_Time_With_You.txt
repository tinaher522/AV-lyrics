<song artist="Janet_Jackson" title="Spending_Time_With_You">
I close my eyes and fantasize
And I just imagine
A tropical island
We're all alone
Our pagers and cell phones cut off
Hot sunny heat
Cool ocean breeze
The sand beneath our feet
The crashing waves are like music
Found a place to sleep
Passion fruit to eat
Use all our energy
Under the moonlight making love 
I don't think nothing can compare
Nothing better than
Nothing better than
Nothing better than
Spending time with you
Nothing better than
Nothing better than
Nothing better than
Spending time with you
You are my angel
Heaven is close
My favorite place is where you are
So we don't have to do nothin' special
Don't wanna run
It's always fun to chill at home 
Monday through Friday
Sexy Saturday
Easy Sunday
Cause every day's a special one
Just like a holiday 
Vacation getaway
After the foreplay
Go room to room makin' sweet love 
I don't think nothing can compare
Nothing better than
Nothing better than
Nothing better than
Spending time with you
(Spending time with you)
Nothing better than
(Yeah yeah)
Nothing better than
(Ohhhwhoaoo)
Nothing better than
Spending time 
(Spending time)
I need time
Morning, noon and night
Just keep it coming, baby
Just keep me coming, baby 
I just love it so much...hmm
Spending time with you
That's all I wanna do...hmm
That's all I wanna do 
(Ooooo)
Nothing better than
(Anytime)
Nothing better than
(Or any place)
Nothing better than
(I'm)
Spending time with you
Nothing better than
(As friends)
Nothing better than
(I'm so content)
Nothing better than
(Cause I'm)
Spending time with you
With my baby
Yeah
(Ohhh with my baby)
Nothing better than
(I love that...hmm...ohh...God, I just love listning to that)
Nothing better than
Nothing better than
Nothing better than
Spending time with you
That's all I wanna do
That's all I wanna do 
That's all I wanna do
That's all I wanna do
