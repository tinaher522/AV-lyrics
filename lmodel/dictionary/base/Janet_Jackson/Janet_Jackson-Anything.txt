<song artist="Janet_Jackson" title="Anything">
Hold me
Kiss me
Show me
You wanna be with me
Feel me
Taste me
And maybe
I'll let you have me
[BRIDGE:]
When you do convince me
Can't turn back
I'll be your best
You know that good things don't come easy
[CHORUS:]
(hold me)
So are you ready
(kiss me)
To journey
(show me)
Within me
(feel me)
I'll satisfy you
(taste me)
I will do anything
(have me)
You ask me to
(ask me)
Anything
(with me)
Anything
[BRIDGE]
[CHORUS (2x)]
For you
[BRIDGE]
[CHORUS]
So are you ready
I will do anything
For you
