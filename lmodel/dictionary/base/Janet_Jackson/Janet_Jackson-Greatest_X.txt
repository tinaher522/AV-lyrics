<song artist="Janet_Jackson" title="Greatest_X">
Yeah [x8]
My momma told me that this could happen to me
That he would grow to be this sexy man
But I just couldn't see
Cause I had my blinders on
I was in my zone
And I had the thought of us in my head
Somehow I turned us all off
And then I met him, and he wasn't you
Then I dropped my head thinkin what should I do
Oh I
I loved you, and
You love me
And I just couldn't see tomorrow, baby
And I cared for you
And I didn't see us through
Now I know in my heart you will always be
The greatest x ever...
Now I can't do a simple thing like fall asleep
Cause I can't close my eyes
Without a day with you in my dreams, dreams
Sometimes I call you phone just to hear you tone
And I never say nothin
Wait just a couple of seconds to hear you breathe
And then I'm gone
But he's not like you
Can't hel but to hold my head
Thinkin what did I do
Oh I
I loved you, and
You love me
And I just couldn't see tomorrow, baby
And I cared for you
And I didn't see us through
Now I know in my heart you will always be
The greatest x ever...
And I know that it's all my fault
And it would be a lie if I said you didn't cross my mind at all
How do I erase from my days that's shaded and blue
All my luv's with you
I loved you, and
You love me
And I just couldn't see tomorrow, baby
And I cared for you
And I didn't see us through
Now I know in my heart you will always be
The greatest x ever...
The Greatest X ever... (Until fade)
