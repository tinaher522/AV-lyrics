<song artist="Janet_Jackson" title="So_Much_Betta">
Tired of being number 2
I can do what she can't do
So much betta I'm for you
So so much betta I'm for you
Don't need another
I can prove it
Just let me love you
Watch me do it
Believe in this
Make a wish
Come see your girl
I'll change yout whole world
Tired of being number 2
I can do what she can't do
So much betta I'm for you
So so much betta I'm for you
Don't need another
I can prove it
Let me love you
Watch how I do it
Believe in this
Make a wish
Come see your girl
I'll change your world
I'm what you've been missin
You might need to jump on this
