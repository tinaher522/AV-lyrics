<song artist="Janet_Jackson" title="Better_Days">
I used to sit and wonder
Would I ever be happy
Life was so bittersweet
So many disappointments
Too many ups and downs for me
When you live a nightmare
It's hard to dream 
But sometimes life just isn't fair
So why complain nobody cares
And I don't wanna waste nobody's time
So I'm 
I'm bout to change my vibe
Today the sun's gonna shine
Cause I made up my mind 
That today will be the start of better days
Leaving old shit behind
And move on with my life
The blindfold's off my eyes
And now all I see for me is better days 
Afraid of my reflection
Tell me that's not me I see
That's who I wanna be 
Stuck somewhere in the middle
On half full or half empty
Waiting for somebody to come and rescue me
Can't let that petty attitude
Start to jade my point of view
Only thing that does is bring me down
So I'm 
I'm about to change my vibe
Today the sun's gonna shine
Cause I made up my mind 
That today will be the start of better days
Leaving old shit behind
And move on with my life
The blindfold's off my eyes
And now all I see for me is better days 
Hurt so many times before
I used to cry but no more
Let it go and life can feel
So good
Stop lying the blues
Can't let that petty attitude
Start to jade my point of view 
Only thing that does is bring me down 
So I'm  
I'm about to change my vibe
Today the sun's gonna shine
Cause I made up my mind 
That today will be the start of better days
Leaving old shit behind
And move on with my life
The blindfold's off my eyes
And now all I see for me is better days
Better days
