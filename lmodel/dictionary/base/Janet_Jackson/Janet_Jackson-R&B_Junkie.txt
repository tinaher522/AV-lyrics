<song artist="Janet_Jackson" title="R&B_Junkie">
I feel like bumpin' to some old skool
I feel like dancin' all night with you
I feel like bumpin' to some old skool
I feel like dancin' all night with you
[Chorus]
Baby time to set it off
We can bum, bump all night
Wanna get my freak on
D.J. keep the party hype
Do the Wop, Don't you stop
Or just smurf it left to right
We could bounce, skate &amp; rock
Play that old skool I like
Ok, here we go
Take it back
Let's get it funky
(I'm a) R&amp;B junkie
You know it babe
Groove me, on the floor
Like that
Music is bumpin'
(Ride it) Get all up on it
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Tell me can u keep it up
Oh, oh, oh, oh
'Til they kick us out the club
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Lookin' like you're having fun
You know how we do it's old skool love
[Chorus]
Ew babe, remember that
Was the jam
DJ is scratchin?
(Go head just get it, get it)
I'm cabbage patchin?
Front, back, side to side
When you slide, so electric
Love how you wreck it
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Tell me can you keep it up
Oh, oh, oh, oh
'Til they kick us out the club
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Lookin' like you're having fun
You know how we do it's old skool love
[Chorus]
I feel like bumpin' to some old skool
I feel like bumpin' to some old skool
I feel like bumpin' to some old skool
I feel like dancin'
It's time to set it off
[Chorus]
Yeah
Ooooooh
