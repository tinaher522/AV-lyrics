<song artist="Janet_Jackson" title="When_We_Oooo">
Hello my love
Wish you were here 
So many things in my heart
That I'd like to share 
A few warm thoughts
A subtle smile
Out conversation through silence
Could last all night
At ease my mind
To see your face 
Those sexy eyes could calm
A heart of rage
You speak my name
I touch your     
The chemistry only true love
Could understand
You've opened my soul to happiness
And shown me new ways of love
Smooth is life's travels with you beside me
I'll never walk alone
Can't get enough of you
When we oooo
Can't get enough of you
When we oooo
Can't get enough of you
You give of you
All you can give
You've taught me love, laugh
You've taught me to live
At rainbow's end
That pot of gold
Can't hold a light to you
'cause you're my heart &amp; soul
Such passionate love that we make 
In time our bodies are one
When loving's done the passion's still strong
'cause spiritually we are as one 
Can't get enough of you
When we oooo
Can't get enough of you
When we oooo
Can't get enough of you
Can't get enough of you
When I oooo
Can't get enough of you
When we oooo
Can't get enough of you
Can't get enough of you
When we oooo
Can't get enough of you
When we oooo
Can't get enough of you
Can't get enough of you
When I oooo
Can't get enough of you
When we oooo
Can't get enough of you
