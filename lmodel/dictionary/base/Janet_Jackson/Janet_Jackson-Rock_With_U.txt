[I want to rock with you]
I want to rock with you
Just once
[I want to rock with you]
Come on…
Oooh ooh ooh ooh – ooh – ooh
Oooh ooh ooh ooh – ooh – ooh
Oooh ooh ooh ooh – ooh – ooh
[I want to rock with you]
Strobe lights make everything sexy yeah... [sexy yeah]
Shadows dancing on the wall
I wanna rock with you
Let's converse
Talk with your body
Don't say anything at all
[I want to rock with you]
Rock with you
Wanna rock with you
[I want to rock with you]
Wanna rock with you
Wanna rock with you
[I want to rock with you]
Wanna rock with you
Oooh ooh ooh ooh – ooh – ooh
Oooh ooh ooh ooh – ooh – ooh
Oooh ooh ooh ooh – ooh – ooh
Oooh ooh ooh ooh – ooh – ooh
Strobe lights make everything sexy yeah
Shadows dancing on the wall [Do you see me?]
I wanna rock with you
Let's converse
Talk with your body
Don't say anything at all
[I want to rock with you]
Shhh
I want to rock with you
Rock with you
Wanna rock with you
[I want to rock with you]
Wanna rock with you
Wanna rock with you
[I want to rock with you]
Rock with you
Oooh ooh ooh ooh - ooh – ooh [Wanna Rock With You]
Oooh ooh ooh ooh - ooh – ooh [Wanna Rock With You]
Oooh ooh ooh ooh - ooh – ooh [Wanna Rock With You]
Oooh ooh ooh ooh - ooh – ooh [Wanna Rock With You]
Oooh ooh ooh ooh - ooh – ooh [Wanna Rock With You]
Rock with you
Wanna rock with you
Wanna rock with you
I want to rock with you
Wanna rock with you
Strobe lights make everything sexy yeah...[so sexy]
Shadows dancing on the wall
Our bodies as one
Ooooh
I wanna rock with you
Let's converse
Talk with your body
Don't say anything at all
I want to rock with you
