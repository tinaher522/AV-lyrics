<song artist="Janet_Jackson" title="God's_Stepchild">
Gotta story for you 
'Bout a little friend 
Never felt good enough 
Had a heart to mend 
Never felt pretty 
Learned to just pretend 
Wished someone had listened 
To her cries of pain 
Maybe I'm the lucky one 
Maybe the forgotten one 
Maybe, but I know 
I'm not God's stepchild 
Didn't want to burden 
Mother had enough stress 
So often I'd talk to you 
Through my four legged friends 
Always there to listen 
Though I felt so all alone 
And in my times of trouble 
I know 
You saw my smile of pain 
Maybe I'm the lucky one 
Maybe the forgotten one 
Maybe, but I know 
I'm not God's stepchild 
Maybe I'm the lucky one 
Maybe the forgotten one 
Maybe, but I know I'm not God's stepchild 
Now that I am older 
Gone through so much pain 
I learned that I should love me 
No more feeling ashamed 
I've seen the great illusions 
I've seen the rough terrain 
I've walked through my own journey 
And my love for you remains 
Maybe I'm the lucky one 
Maybe the forgotten one 
Maybe, but I know 
I'm not God's stepchild 
Maybe I'm the lucky one 
Maybe the forgotten one 
Maybe, but I know 
I'm not God's stepchild 
I know I'm the lucky one 
I know I'm a special one 
I know, that God does 
Not have a stepchild
