<song artist="Janet_Jackson" title="Accept_Me">
There's something you must know
I'm so misunderstood 
I am a special girl 
Living in my special world 
You know you can't change me 
Rather you gotta see me for me boy 
I'm doing the best I can 
Try to understand 
Accept me for who I am 
No woman can take my place baby 
I'm doing the best I can 
So please don't give up on me 
Accept me for who I am 
Just try and understand 
'Cause that's the way it is, babe 
You are my soul, unique 
My dream that's come to me 
You know I can't change you 
But then again, I don't want to 
You seem to understand 
When I say I need a loving hand 
My dream who only loves me for me. 
Accept me for who I am 
No woman can take my place baby 
I'm doing the best I can 
So please don't give up on me 
Accept me for who I am 
Just try and understand 
'Cause that's the way it is, babe 
Accept me for who I am 
No woman can take my place baby 
I'm doing the best I can 
So please don't give up on me 
Accept me for who I am 
Just try and understand 
'Cause that's the way it is, babe 
I try to make you see 
Just what you do to me 
I go crazy when I hear your voice or see your smile
Ooh, you don't know what you do to me 
You make me wanna never have another, 
Easy to mind... 
Accept me for... 
Accept me for... 
Accept me for who I am 
No woman can take my place baby 
I'm doing the best I can 
So please don't give up on me 
Accept me for who I am 
Just try and understand 
'Cause that's the way it is, babe 
Accept me for who I am 
No woman can take my place baby 
I'm doing the best I can 
So please don't give up on me 
Accept me for who I am 
Just try and understand 
'Cause that's the way it is, babe
