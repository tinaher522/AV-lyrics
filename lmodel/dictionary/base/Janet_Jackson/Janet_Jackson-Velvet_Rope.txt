<song artist="Janet_Jackson" title="Velvet_Rope">
We have a special need
To feel that we belong
Come with me inside
Inside my velvet rope
We have a special need
To feel that we belong
Come with me inside
Inside my velvet rope
This special need
That's within us
Brings out the best
Yet worst in us
Follow the passion
That's within you
Living the truth
Will set you free
We have a special need
To feel that we belong
Come with me inside
Inside my velvet rope
Put others down
To feel us up
Oppressing me
Will oppress you
Outside leave judgement
Outside leave hate
One love's the answer
You'll find in you
We have a special need
To feel that we belong
Come with me inside
Inside my velvet rope
