<song artist="Janet_Jackson" title="What_About">
We walked along the beach
What a moon lit night
He held my hands in his
He kissed me he said
I wanna spend my life with you
I want you for my wife
Just then I thought
What about the times you lied to me
What about the times you said no one would want me
What about all the shit you've done to me
What about that 
What about that
What about the times you yelled at me
What about the times I cried
You wouldn't even hold me
What about those things
What about that
What about that
I took a pause
And then a deep sigh
He looked right into my eyes
As he said
I know I didn't say somethin' wrong
I didn't have the courage to say
But then I thought
What about the times you lied to me
What about the times you said no one would want me
What about all the shit you've done to me
What about that 
What about that
What about the times you yelled at me
What about the times I cried
You wouldn't even hold me
What about those things
What about that
What about that
Oh
What about the times you hit my face
What about the times you kept on when I said
No more please
What about those things
What about that
What about that oh
What about the times you shamed me
What about the times when you said you didn't fuck her
She only gave you head
What about that
What about that
Don't wanna live my life in misery
Don't tell me you did it 'cause you love me
I don't believe
I'm sick and tired
Your deceptive games
Wonder where
You have been
I can't live life wondering
My heart was poundin'
But the time had come
To stop lettin' my whisperin' heart control me
And tellin' my screamin' mind what to do
I looked him straight in the eye
And then I said
What about the times you lied to me
What about the times you said no one would want me
What about all the shit you've done to me
What about that 
What about that
What about the times you yelled at me
What about the times I cried
You wouldn't even hold me
What about those things
What about that
What about that
What about the times you hit my face
What about the times you kept on when I said
No more please
What about those things
What about that
What about that oh
What about the times you shamed me
What about the times when you said you didn't fuck her
She only gave you head
What about that
What about that
What about the times you lied to me
What about the times you said no one would want me
What about all the shit you've done to me
What about that 
What about that
What about the times you yelled at me
What about the times I cried
You wouldn't even hold me
What about those things
What about that
What about that
What about the times you hit my face
What about the times you kept on when I said
No more please
What about those things
What about that
What about that oh
What about the times you shamed me
What about the times when you said you didn't fuck her
She only gave you head
What about that
What about that
