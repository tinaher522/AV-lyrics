<song artist="Janet_Jackson" title="Every_Time">
I'm afraid I'm starting to feel
What I said I would not do
The last time really hurt me
I'm scared to fall in love
Afraid to love so fast
'Cause every time I fall in love
It seems to never last
But every time your love is near
And every time I'm filled with fear
'Cause every time I see your face
My heart does begin to race every time
One half want me to go
Other half wants me to stay
I just get so all confused
I'm scared to fall in love
Afraid to love so fast
'Cause every time I fall in love
It seems to never last
But every time your love is near
And every time I'm filled with fear
'Cause every time
My heart does begin to race every time
I'm scared to fall in love
Afraid to love so fast
'Cause every time I fall in love
It seems to never last
Every time your love is near
And every time I'm filled with fear
'Cause every time I see your face
My heart does begin to race every time
Every time your love is near
And every time I'm filled with fear
'Cause every time I see your face
Could it be that this will be the one that lasts
The fear does start to erase every time
Oh could it be that this will be the one that lasts
For all my times
For all my times
