<song artist="Janet_Jackson" title="Put_Your_Hands_On">
The ball without the game
The link without the chain
The face without a name
No need to be ashamed
So here we are baby
We both know it's feeling crazy
I dare you to stop at nothing tonight
We're walking a tightrope
Why don't you wanna let go
And fall into the sublime
You got this fear of flight
My bodies on fire
I think it's about the time'ya
Let it go into over drive
Don't you wanna taste it
Touch it and stimulate it
Till I can feel it deep inside
Don't be so uptight
(You know it feels right)
If your energy
Explodes all in me
Just indulge in pleasure
Set our bodies free
Get lost in all of this love
Soft to the touch
I'm every inch a woman
Don't be shy to feel me
Come on
Put your hands on
The ball without the game
The link without the chain
The face without a name
No need to be ashamed
It's cool to be shy,but
Don't let it pass you by, just
Give up and let your senses go
You know I wanna feel'ya
Come here a little nearer
And let the fantasy unfold
Need no control
If your energy
Explodes all in me
Just indulge in pleasure
Set our bodies free
Get lost in all of this love
Soft to the touch
I'm every inch a woman
Don't be shy to feel me
Come on
It's cool to be shy, baby
Stimulate me
Don't you wanna touch it
You know you wanna taste it
Let your senses go
Let the fantasy unfold
Put your hands on
Oh yeah
If your energy
Explodes all in me
Just indulge in pleasure
Set our bodies free
Get lost in all of this love
Soft to the touch
I'm every inch a woman
Don't be shy to feel me
Come on
