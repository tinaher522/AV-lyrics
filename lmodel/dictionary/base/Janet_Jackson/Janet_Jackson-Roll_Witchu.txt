<song artist="Janet_Jackson" title="Roll_Witchu">
Roll it, stop
Roll it, stop
Roll it and drop
Baby now rock it with me
Oh baby, oh baby pop
Follow my directions
You will be okay
Roll with it roll with it stop
When you do it right
You'll see it on my face
Gotta
1 let it drop
2 make it hot
3 don't you stop
'till you hit that spot tonight
Let's go on let it rock
Ready or not
Come on baby ride on it
Come on lay that vibe on it
Chorus:
Can I just roll withchu
Out on the floor witchu
Oh the sexy way you move
Layin' it down
Takin' it slow witchu
Like when the flow is smooth
Keepin' it inside the mood
Layin' it down
Love everything you do
Wanna do it all night witchu
And truly go home with you
Layin' it down
Can I just roll withchu
Out on the floor witchu
Oh the sexy way you move
Layin' it down
Roll baby, roll with it drop
That extra little thing that you do
It drives me crazy
Now roll with it, roll baby drop
doing different moves that keep driving me insane
Close in 4 let it rock
5 on top
6 don't you stop
'till you hit the spot tonight
Let's go and let it rock
Ready or not
Come on baby, ride on it
Come on lay that vibe on it
Chorus
Spoken bridge
Anytime we're dancin'
Ain't no holdin' back
Our bodies start to react
Just let go and be free (I get the feelin)
When you're dancing close to me (keeping the rhythm)
I feel you all over me
You make me feel so right
When you're holding me tight
Roll with it, wanna roll witchu
Baby tonight
I wanna roll witchu
Dance slow witchu
I wanna roll witchu
Get low witchu
Baby
Chorus
