<song artist="Janet_Jackson" title="Love_And_My_Best_Friend">
Chorus:
Love and my best friend
Nothin' better can be found
To make the world go 'round
We keep each other's secrets hid
Go on to talk for hours
Never tiring of the closeness
Only friends can share
We cross our hearts hoping to die
If fate should separate us 
But we have on never change
Nothing can compare to
Repeat Chorus
You're the special one I turn to
For some help and understanding
When the world gets too demanding
You're always there 
To guide me when I'm wrong
Support me when I'm right 
For you I'd do the same
Because I care for
Repeat Chorus
