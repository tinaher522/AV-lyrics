<song artist="Janet_Jackson" title="Like_You_Don't_Love_Me">
I saw your manhood risin'
Cause you were fantasizin'
I guess that model in that lingerie got you excited
At night when I crawl in bed 
Wearing that same teddy bear
You only said I love you
Kissed me and ro-rolled over and slept 
Damn is that all I get from you
'Bout to give me an attitude
You need to make love to me 
Like you don't love me again
Don't have to be gentle tonight
Just be an animal tonight
You need to make love to me 
Like you don't love me
Just do me baby (yeah)
Come on an drive me crazy (yeah yeah)
Act like I'm not your lady (uh-huh)
Do me like you wanna do them other girls 
(Just) do me baby 
Come on and drive me crazy
Act like I'm not your lady
Do me like you wanna do them other girls 
Why you been tellin' your boys
How you been breaking me off
Must be somebody else who's back you broke
Cause I didn't get none 
You're up at three in the morn 
Watchin' that triple X porn
But you're so tired when you make love to me
What did you learn 
Damn is that all I get from you (ohhhh)
'Bout to give me an attitude
You need to make love to me (woo)
Like you don't love me then 
(like you don't love me)
Don't have to be gentle tonight
Just be an animal tonight
(animal tonight)
You need to make love to me 
Like you don't love me 
Just do me, baby (yeah)
Come on an drive me crazy (oooh)
Act like I'm not your lady (doooo)
Do me like you wanna do them other girls 
(Just) do me baby (yeah)
Come on an drive me crazy (crazy)
Act like I'm not your lady (your lady)
Do me like you wanna do them other girls (do me baby)
Do do do do do do do do
(do me babe)
Do do do do do do do do 
(do me baby)
(yeah)
That's right, come on
Do do
Baby baby baby
Hit it like this baby 
Yeah
Do me baby (yeah)
Come on an drive me crazy (yeah)
Act like I'm not your lady (ah)
Do me like you wanna do them other girls (do)
(Just) do me baby 
Come on an drive me crazy
Act like I'm not your lady (yeah)
Do me like you wanna do them other girls
