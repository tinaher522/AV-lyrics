Saw the cover Finest girl you've ever seen
Just had to buy me 
Had to try me 
Ohh you're in love with 
The hottest girl in the magazine
You do whatever to have me all to yourself
I know you can't stop lookin
So don't try to deny it
Baby I see it in your eyes
You do anything if 
I let you inside me 
What would you do if 
I came to life
Let me tell ya
This body of mine
This body of mine 
Boy I'm tying to warn you bout
This body of mine 
This body of mine 
You'll go crazy wehn you see me see me
Start shaking and moving all around
Start shaking and moving all around
Start shaking and moving all around
Start shaking and moving all around 
Now we're at your home lead the way to your room 
What you're lookin for
Is right on page 52
You see what you like 
Reading bout what I like
When I'm all alone in the zone with a man
Now would you be ready if I stepped off these pages
And told you that that man was you
Or would you turn out to have some great conversation
But didn't know what to do
Once you got a look at 
This body of mine
This body of mine 
Boy I'm tying to warn you bout
This body of mine 
This body of mine 
You'll go crazy wehn you see me see me
Start shaking and moving all around
Start shaking and moving all around
Start shaking and moving all around
Start shaking and moving all around 
Now I was walking 
Through the airport
Stopped at the gift shop
Saw this girl on the cover
Actually made a ni**a jaw drop
Man she was F-I-N-E head to toe
Six page spread Baddest thang I ever seen before
Stuck in the store dreaming
Can't even get to the register
Girl behind the counter
Talking but I'm like the hell with her
Cause I swear I deserve this girl
Talking to the pages 
Telling me what she like 
And how she like it In different places
What she eat to keep her body tight 
Definiton of Mr. right
I fit that description to the T
To the tall the sh** that she don't like 
Live for late night 
It sound like she's talking right to me 
Especially when she said 
I know you can't stop lookin
So don't try to deny it
Baby I can see in your eyes 
You do anything if I let you insde me 
What would you do if 
I came to life
Let me tell ya
This body of mine
This body of mine 
Boy I'm tying to warn you bout
This body of mine 
This body of mine 
You'll go crazy wehn you see me see me
Start shaking and moving all around
Start shaking and moving all around
Start shaking and moving all around
Start shaking and moving all around
