<song artist="Janet_Jackson" title="Empty">
How could it be
That you know me
My deepest fears
My fantasies
Confide in you
What no one knows
But it feels so real
When I close my eyes
I can see your face
When I lick my lips
I can taste your smile
When I see your name
My heart starts to race
If I can't read your thoughts
Then I feel empty
When I close my eyes
I feel empty
When I close my eyes
I feel empty
When I close my eyes
Lord I feel empty
When I close my eyes
1234
Is this a new way to love
Never face to face
Is it enough
Does it really count
Or am I a fool
So tell me please
Am I wasting my time
Your phrases
Descriptive
And though the textured words
With beauty
You post it
And use such colored verbs
We've never met
When I close my eyes
I can see your face
When I lick my lips
I can taste your smile
When I see your name
My heart starts to race
If I can't read your thoughts
Then I feel empty
When I close my eyes
I feel empty
When I close my eyes
Ohh I feel empty
When I close my eyes
Empty
When I close my eyes

I'm rushin' home
To turn you on
Sometimes you're there
Sometimes you're gone
Wait for hours
For your return
So tell me please
Am I wasting my time
Your phrases
Descriptive
And though the textured words
With beauty
You post it
And use such colored verbs
So tell me
You think that
Maybe we're gone insane
To find a, a lover
And thought the words of pain
We never meet
When I close my eyes
I can see your face
When I lick my lips
I can taste your smile
When I see your name
My heart starts to race
If I can't read your thoughts
Then I feel empty
