<song artist="Janet_Jackson" title="70's_Love_Groove_-_Previously_Unreleased">
Hey baby
Just let me do all the work
Wait, let me put this record on
Mmm, I like that
Tonight you're all mine
Afros, incense and black lights
Love beads, mood rings and candle light
Zodiac says the time is right
For a 70's love groove
(70's love groove)
Afros, incense and black lights
Love beads, mood rings and candle light
Zodiac says the time is right
For a 70's love groove
Do you like my body?
I've got on what you like
Take your time
We've got all night
70's kinda love
70's kinda love
Afros, incense and black lights
Love beads, mood rings and candle light
Zodiac says the time is right
For a 70's love groove
(70's love groove)
Afros, incense and black lights
Love beads, mood rings and candle light
Zodiac says the time is right
For a 70's love groove
(70's love groove)
70's kinda love
70's kinda love
Anything, anything baby
I'll take you places
You've never been before
Touch me here, now touch me there
70's kinda love
70's kinda love
Afros, incense and black lights
Love beads, mood rings and candle light
Zodiac says the time is right
For a 70's love groove
(70's love groove)
Afros, incense and black lights
Love beads, mood rings and candle light
Zodiac says the time is right
For a 70's love groove
70's kinda love
70's kinda love
Afros, incense and black lights
Love beads, mood rings and candle light
Zodiac says the time is right
For a 70's love groove
(70's love)
Afros, incense and black lights
Love beads, mood rings and candle light
Zodiac says the time is right
For a 70's love groove
70's kinda love
70's kinda love
Afros, incense and black lights
Love beads, mood rings and candle light
Zodiac says the time is right
For a 70's love groove
(70's kinda love)
Afros, incense and black lights
Love beads, mood rings and candle light
Zodiac says the time is right
For a 70's love groove
