<song artist="Janet_Jackson" title="Everywhere_I_Go">
There are times when I look above and beyond
There are times when I feel your love around me, baby
I'll never forget, ma baby
(I'll never forget you)
There are times when I look above and beyond
There are times when I feel your love around me, baby
I'll never forget, ma baby
When I feel that I don't belong
Draw my strength from the words when you said
"Hey it's about you, baby, look deeper inside you, baby"
Dream about us together again
When I want us together again, baby
I know we'll be together again 'cuz
Everywhere I go, every smile I see
I know you are there smilin' back at me
Dancin' in moonlight I know you are free
'Cuz I can see your star shinin' down on me
(Together again, ooh)
Good times we'll share again
(Together again, ooh)
That makes me wanna dance
(Together again, ooh)
Say it loud and proud
(Together again, ohh)
All my love's for you
Always been a true angel to me now above
I can't wait for you to wrap your wings around me, baby
Wrap them around me, baby
Sometimes hear you whisperin'
No more pain, no worries will you ever see now, baby
I'm so happy for ma baby
I dream about us together again
When I want us together again, baby
I know we'll be together again 'cuz
Everywhere I go, every smile I see
I know you are there smilin' back at me
Dancin' in moonlight, I know you are free
'Cuz I can see your star shinin' down on me
(Together again, ooh)
Good times we'll share again
(Together again, ooh)
That makes me wanna dance
(Together again, ooh)
Say it loud and proud
(Together again, ohh)
All my love's for you
There are times when I look above and beyond
There are times when I feel you smile upon me, baby
I'll never forget, ma baby
What'll I give just to hold you close
As on earth in heaven we will be together, baby
Together again, ma baby
Everywhere I go, every smile I see
I know you are there smilin' back at me
Dancin' in moonlight, I know you are free
'Cuz I can see your star shinin' down on me
Everywhere I go, every smile I see
I know you are there, smilin' back at me
Dancin' in moonlight I know you are free
'Cuz I can see your star shinin' down on me
