<song artist="Janet_Jackson" title="Get_It_Out_Me">
What more can I say about you
Boy you're so hot
Ooh yeah baby I ain't never
Felt that there boy don't you stop
You found my spot
Cause you know I likes it when you do it mo better
Like when you say to me
Aww Jan you body feels like none I've ever felt
You know it makes the you know what come out, ohhh
I know you're wit it come and get it
Cause you know it
Its true, it's you, it's something that you do
Ain't nobody has been able to
Get it out me
Get it out me
It's yout, it's something that you do
Ain't nobody has been able to
Get it out me
Get it out me
What it is I do not know but you make me want to let it go
Let me break it down one time
Hope you don't mind
But I really wanna try something that you think is
Taboo but you will be more than satisfied
Boy I'm getting wild now watch me go way out
Into another place, into another space
We can make this as creative as you like
Feel free to express yourself
I'm gonna get it, love it, take it till there's nothing left
It's true, it's you, it's something that you do
That nobody has been able to
Get it out me
Get it out me
It's you; it's something that you do
Ain't nobody has been able to
Get it out me
Get it out me
Ain't too many people that can get it out of me
Something about your swagger
And the way you talk to me
Ain't too many people that can get it out me
Something about your swagger
And the way you talk to me
Break it down now
Break it down now
Break it down now
It's true, it's you, it's something that you do
Ain't nobdoy has been able to
Get it out me
Get it out me
It's you, it's something that you do
Ain't nobody has been able to
Get it out me
Get it out me
What it is I do not know but you make me want to let it go
