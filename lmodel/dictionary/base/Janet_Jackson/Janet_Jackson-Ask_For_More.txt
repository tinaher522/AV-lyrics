<song artist="Janet_Jackson" title="Ask_For_More">
Feel you, hold you, taste you as you travel
Deep into my senses, so refreshing
Soon you will open up the door
Feel my eternal love
So pour yourself right into me
Too much is never enough
I love love
You need a love
Don't be afraid
Just ask for more
I need love
You have love
Don't be afraid
Just ask for more
Come feel love
Come taste love
Just ask for more
Da da de da, 
da da de da, 
da da de da, 
da da de da (Ha ha, ha ha)
Give the love a chance to speak to you
And its voice will bring passion
As I taste you in your silence
I feel the love
When we're having fun
So pour yourself right into me
Too much is never enough
I love love
You need a love
Don't be afraid
Just ask for more
I need love
You have love
Don't be afraid
Just ask for more
Deserve love
Touch this love
Don't be afraid
Just ask for more
Come feel love
Come taste love
Just ask for more
Da da de da, da da de da
(Ha ha, ha ha, ha ha ha)
Da da de da, da da de da
(Ha ha)
Feel you, hold you, taste you as you travel
Deep into my senses, so refreshing
Soon you will open up the door
To my eternal love
So pour yourself right into me
Too much is never enough
I love love
You need a love
Don't be afraid
Just ask for more
I need a love
You have a love
Don't be afraid
Just ask for more
Deserve love
Touch this love
Don't be afraid
Just ask for more
Come feel love
Come taste love
Just ask for more
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Come taste the love
You're looking for
Ask for more
Come taste the love
You're looking for
Ask for more
Come taste the love
You're looking for
Ask for more
Come taste the love
You're looking for
Ask for more
Come taste the love
You're looking for
Ask for more
Come taste the love
You're looking for
Ask for more
Come taste the love
You're looking for
Ask for more
Come taste the love
You're looking for
Ask for more
Come taste the love, love, love
