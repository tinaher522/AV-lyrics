<song artist="Janet_Jackson" title="Special">
Hey J
It's been a long time since I've seen you last
A half and twenty-six years
(how time goes fast)
I'm well
Though I've gone through some deep changes in my life
It hasn't been easy
Oh no not for me
It's been difficult at times
Sometimes I sit down and cry
And ask God oh why
(fair... what is?)
[BRIDGE:]
I know how you're feelin
Same thing I did deal with
You're not as alone as you may feel
You see but oh it catches up to us fast
We have to deal with our past
I know it's painful but
There you'll find specialness
Cuz everybody needs to feel real special
[CHORUS:]
We need to
Remember
That love lies deep within ourselves
We have to
Want it so
It starts with us and only us
We must learn
We're all born
With specialness inside of us
I have the need to feel real special too
You see
You can't run away from your pain
Because wherever you run
There you will be
You have to learn
To water your spiritual garden
Then
You will be free
[BRIDGE]
[CHORUS (2x)]
Work in progress
