<song artist="Janet_Jackson" title="Dammn_Baby">
Damn baby, baby
I gotta hear me
Damn baby, baby
Damn
Ya same ol' song
Is draggin me down
Not good for my body
Change it up
Cuz it ain't nothing like
Having your own ID
My lanes been stuck
I've never been afraid
To swich oh no not me
And they show me love
For being original
And tell 'em make room
Shake the room
Bang bang ya gon gon get it
You gotta get up off that grey line
And can't nobody tell you
What you can't do
Shut that down automatic
And I'll guarantee they'll fall in line
Watch 'em all go
Dammn baby, watch 'em all go
Dammn baby, watch 'em all go
Dammn baby, watch 'em all go
Dammn baby
A brand new movement
That started with a
Conversation in a caf√©
It's all about love
And how we ain't gon never let
Words get in the way
When you're giving it up
It's never what you say
It sayin' what you do
You wanna show me love
Let's keep that conversation honey
And tell 'em make room
Shake the room
Bang bang ya gon gon get it
You gotta get up off that grey line
And can't nobody tell you
What you can't do
Shut that down automatic
And I'll guarantee they'll fall in line
Watch 'em all go
Dammn baby, watch 'em all go
Dammn baby, watch 'em all go
Dammn baby, watch 'em all go
Dammn baby
And now the breakdown
Plush
Gonna break it down, break it down, break it down
Gonna break it down, break it down
Gonna break it down, break it down
Watching them all go dammn
Watching them all go dammn
Watching them all go dammn baby
Watching them all go
And tell 'em make room
Shake the room
Bang bang ya gon gon get it
You gotta get up off that grey line
And can't nobody tell you
What you can't do
Shut that down automatic
And I'll guarantee they'll fall in line
Watch 'em all go
Dammn baby, watch 'em all go
Dammn baby, watch 'em all go
Dammn baby, watch 'em all go
Dammn baby
Dammn baby, watch 'em all go
Dammn baby, watch 'em all go
Dammn baby, watch 'em all go
Dammn baby
