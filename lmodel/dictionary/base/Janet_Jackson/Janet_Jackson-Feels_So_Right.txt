<song artist="Janet_Jackson" title="Feels_So_Right">
Oh how can it be true
God's gift me and you
And I won't take it for granted
My love for you is strong
With this can't go wrong
And I can't believe this feeling
I don't know
So confused
What to do
How 'bout you
Please don't pull away from me
I don't know
So confused
What to do
Feelin you
And in the end you ask me
(Chorus)
feels so right lovin you
feels so right touchin you
touch think wish love
accept this love
Accepting you as you are
Believe in this love
And we will rise above
Thick and thin til the end yeah
I don't know
So confused
What to do
How bout you
Please don't pull away from me
I don't know
So confused
What to do
Feelin you
And in the end you ask me
Feels so right lovin you
Feels so right touchin you
Feels so right holding you
Feels so right kissing
That I gotta believe
I don't know
So confused
What to do
How bout you
Please don't pull away from me
I don't know
So confused
What to do
Feelin you
And in the end you ask me
Feels so right lovin you
Feels so right touchin you
Feels so right holding you
Feels so right kissing you
That I gotta believe
