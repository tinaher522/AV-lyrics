<song artist="Janet_Jackson" title="Someone_To_Call_My_Lover_(Remix)">
Janet, So So Def, yeah uh
I put my hand up on your hip
When I dip, you dip, we dip
I put my hand up on your hip
When I dip, you dip, remix
I put my hand up on your hip
When I dip, you dip, we dip
I put my hand up on your hip
When I dip, we dip, listen to the remix
Back on the road again
Feelin' kind of lonely and
Looking for the right guy to be mine
Friends say I'm crazy cause
Easily I fall in love
You gotta do it different "J" this time
Maybe we'll meet at a bar
He'll drive a funky car
Maybe we'll meet at a club
And fall so deeply in love
He'll tell me I'm the one
And we'll have so much fun
I'll be the girl of his dreams, maybe
Alright maybe gonna find him today
I gotta get someone to call my lover
Yeah baby, come on
Alright baby come and pass my way
I gotta get someone to call my lover
Yeah baby, come on
Ay-i-ay, ay-i-ay, ay-ay-ay
Ay-i-ay, ay-i-ay, ay-ayyyy
Ay-i-ay, ay-i-ay, ay-ay-ay
Ay-i-ay, ay-i-ay, ay-ayyyy
I spoil them when I'm in love
Giving them what they dream of
Sometimes it's not a good thing, but I'm blind
I love hard with everything
Giving my all more than they
I took my friend's advice this time
I do it differently
Maybe we'll meet at a bar
He'll drive a funky car
Maybe we'll meet at a club
And fall so deeply in love
He'll tell me I'm the one
And we'll have so much fun
I'll be the girl of his dreams, maybe
Alright maybe gonna find him today
I gotta get someone to call my lover
Yeah baby, come on
Alright baby come and pass my way
I gotta get someone to call my lover
Yeah baby, come on
Ay-i-ay, ay-i-ay, ay-ay-ay
Ay-i-ay, ay-i-ay, ay-ayyyy
Ay-i-ay, ay-i-ay, ay-ay-ay
Ay-i-ay, ay-i-ay, ay-ayyyy
Yeah, uh-huh, huh
Now what you need to do is, holla at me
I understand everything you need
Know for sure, even though you feel lonely
Know for sure, before you push the speed
And find yourself in a place you ain't trying to be
He ain't gotta have dough, he gotta make you laugh
Know what to do when you're feelin' bad
Know what to do when you're feelin' sad
Fix you something to eat and run your bath, oh
My, my looking for a guy, guy
I don't want him too shy
But he's gotta have the qualities
That I like in a man
Strong, smart, affectionate
He's gotta be all for me and I'll be too
You'll see happily
Gotta know how to spend his time
Gotta know how to use his mind
Gotta know how to say what's mine is yours
And baby what's yours is mine
If you can't find, I'mma be right here
Everything you want is right here
I wouldn't lie to you
I'm the cat at the bar with the cranberry car
In the club, that you about to fall in love, remix
Maybe we'll meet at a bar
He'll drive a funky car
Maybe we'll meet at a club
And fall so deeply in love
He'll tell me I'm the one
And we'll have so much fun
I'll be the girl of his dreams, maybe
Alright maybe gonna find him today
I gotta get someone to call my lover
Yeah baby, come on
Alright baby come and pass my way
I gotta get someone to call my lover
Yeah baby, come on
Alright maybe gonna find him today
I gotta get someone to call my lover
Yeah baby, come on
Alright baby come and pass my way
I gotta get someone to call my lover
Yeah baby, come on
Ay-i-ay, ay-i-ay, ay-ay-ay
Ay-i-ay, ay-i-ay, ay-ayyyy
Ay-i-ay, ay-i-ay, ay-ay-ay
Ay-i-ay, ay-i-ay, ay-ayyyy

Maybe we'll meet at a club
And fall so deeply in love

And we'll have so much fun
I'll be the girl of his dreams, maybe
Alright maybe gonna find him today
