<song artist="Janet_Jackson" title="You'll_Never_Find_(A_Love_Like_Mine)">
Chorus:
You know that you'll never find
A love as true as mine
Our love is a one of a kind
Boy, why waste your time
Foul play never brought you down
You took your love on a rebound
Been no angles, just straight ahead
'Cause you know where my heart is
Bridge
So don't turn me away
I know that we can make it
I beg you to stay
Give our love a try 'cause you know...
Repeat Chorus
You shake me up, but you can't bring me down
This school girl crush, you can't push around
So set your game on the right track
'Cause once you leave, it's hard to get back
Repeat Bridge
Repeat Chorus
You know it, now show it, you know it
It's a one of a kind love
Boy, why waste your time
