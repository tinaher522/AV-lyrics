<song artist="Janet_Jackson" title="You_Can_Be_Mine">
You can be mine
You can be mine
You can be mine
You can be mine
Hey baby, I like your style
I'd like to hang around
If you're good, look what you'll find
I'll let you, you be mine
You can be mine (if you're good)
You can be mine (you can be mine)
You can be mine (wish you would)
You can be mine (you can be mine)
Not in front, never behind
Always just right on time
Always thinking, man with a mind
Ready to please me, that's my type
You can be mine (if you're good)
You can be mine (you can be mine)
You can be mine (wish you would)
You can be mine (you can be mine)
You can be mine (make that move)
You can be mine (you can be mine)
You can be mine (I really wish you would)
You can be mine (you can be mine)
What'cha gonna do
Better get on your job now
Time to go to work
If you want to be mine
Better get on your job now
Time to make me happy
If you want to be mine
Clap your hands
You can be mine (if you're good)
You can be mine (you can be mine)
You can be mine (wish you would)
You can be mine (you can be mine)
You can be mine (Make the move)
You can be mine (Should be mine)
You can be mine (Yeah yeah)
You can be mine (Should be mine, baby)
Jellybean, Jellybean, Jellybean, Jellybean
I can't believe this!
Just look what he's doing to be mine
You get a kick out of it!
Baby you can be mine
You can be mine
Fellas help me out
That's good
Can I hear that line one more time?
