<song artist="Janet_Jackson" title="Clouds">
(Janet Jackson):
You tell 'em, Carly!
(Carly Simon):
See, Janet and me, we have clouds
Yes, we have our clouds
(Janet Jackson):
Go on
(Carly Simon):
So many and so many great formations
Who's this song about?
(Janet Jackson):
Don't hurt 'em now
(Carly Simon):
Hallucinations
(Janet laughs)
(Carly Simon):
Clouds in my coffee
Clouds in my coffee
(Janet Jackson):
You tell 'em, Carly
