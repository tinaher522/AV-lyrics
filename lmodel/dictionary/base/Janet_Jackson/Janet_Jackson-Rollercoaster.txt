<song artist="Janet_Jackson" title="Rollercoaster">
Ohhh you make me up and down through emotions 
Like a rollercoaster
Spin like a ferris wheel 
Ohhh you turn me upside down with my feelings 
And I know the reason 
Baby your love is surreal 
You make me go X5 (woah)
Let's go 
Like a rollercoaster 
There’s a high level of love going on  
The feelings are just way too strong  
The reason that you got me gone  
Is baby cause you turn me on 
With a bit of it more than a little bit 
I get addicted every time I get a hit of it 
Cause oh baby you take me so high
When I’m on your rollercoaster ride 
I’m in and out of love 
And it’s all because 
I can’t make up my mind 
I’m so confused 
Don’t know what to do
And it’s 'cause of you 
Ohhh you make me up and down through emotions 
Like a rollercoaster
Spin like a ferris wheel 
Ohhh you take me upside down with my feelings 
And I know the reason 
Baby your love is surreal

Boy you give me butterflies 
So deep inside 
Brings me down when I look in those eyes 
Takes me out way across the sky 
Baby boy I won’t lie 
Usually I’m not this shy 
You do it to me every time 
I get on your rollercoaster ride 
I’m in and out of love 
And it’s all because 
I can’t make up my mind 
I’m so confused 
Don’t know what to do
And it’s 'cause of you 
Ohhh you bring me up and down through emotions 
Like a rollercoaster
Spin like a ferris wheel 
Ohhh you take me upside down with my feelings 
And I know the reason 
Baby your love is surreal
You make me go X3
Make Me go 
You make me go X2
Like a rollercoaster 
Cause you make me go up and down 
And around and around and 
I can’t take it 
You make me go up and down 
And around and around 
That’s why boy I can’t take it 
I’m in and out of love 
And it’s all because 
I can’t make up my mind 
I’m so confused 
Don’t know what to do
And it’s 'cause of you 
Ohhh you make me up and down through emotions (Ohhh you make me, baby) 
Like a rollercoaster (oooh...I)
Spin like a ferris wheel (Spinnin' me 'round, Oh baby)
Ohhh you take me upside down with my feelings (I..I)
And I know the reason 
Baby your love is surreal (Love is surreal)
Ohhh you make me up and down through emotions (Emotions)
Like a rollercoaster (Rollercoaster)
Spin like a ferris wheel (Baby, baby, baby, baby)
Ohhh you take me upside down with my feelings (ooh yeah)
And I know the reason 
Baby your love is surreal (You make me go, You make me go)
You make me go X3
Make Me go 
You make me go X2
Like a rollercoaster
