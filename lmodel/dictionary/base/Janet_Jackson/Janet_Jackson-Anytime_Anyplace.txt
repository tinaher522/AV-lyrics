<song artist="Janet_Jackson" title="Anytime_Anyplace">
In the thunderin' rain you stare into my eyes
I can feel your hands moving up my thighs
Skirt around my waist wall against my face
I can feel your lips
I don't wanna stop just because
People walkin' by are watchin' us
I don't give a damn what they think
I want you now
I don't wanna stop just because
You feel so good inside of my love
I'm not gonna stop no no no
I want you all I wanna say is
Any time, and any place
I don't care who's around
Any time, and any place
I don't care who's around
Dancin' on the floor feeling the slow groove
My mind is startin' to burn with forbidden thoughts
Strangers all around with the light down low
I was thinkin' maybe we could well you know
I don't wanna stop just because
People standin' 'round watchin' us
I don't give a damn what they think
I want you now
I don't wanna stop just because
You feel so good inside of my love
I'm not gonna to stop no no no
I want you all I wanna say is
Any time, and any place
I don't care who's around
Any time, and any place
I don't care who's around
