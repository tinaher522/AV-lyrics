Ooooooh...yeah
You're feelin' in it...yeah
You're ticklin' it...yeah
You're swimmin' in it...yeah
You're gonna get it...moist...moist...moist  
Ooooooh...yeah
You're feelin' in it...yeah
You're ticklin' it...yeah
You're swimmin' in it...yeah
You're gonna get it...moist...moist...moist  
I'm insatiable
And it's all your fault 
So much lust involved
To get me off
My water falls 
Your sexuality (breeds)
A storm inside of me (seas)
A touch is all I need
To make me scream
Obscenities 
Every time you whisper in my ear I get aroused
You begin to slowly unbutton my blouse
Kissing on my skin my heart's racing now 
I want you boy
Ooooooh
Caught up in the waves of passion up &amp; down
Love the way you movin' my body all around
Boy you bout to make the rain come down
Boy you bout to make the rain come down (Boy you bout to make the rain come down)
Feel my, rain come
Pourin', soakin'
Longin', your lips
Baby ooh
You make it so moist
When my, ocean's, overflowin'
Afterglowin'
Take me ooh
You make me so moist
Orgasmic
Row it just like that 
Hope you like drownin' in it
You don't have a life jacket 
My thirst is quenched
Oooh baby we're so drenched
Our bodies rhythms' are 
So cataclysmic
Got me twisted 
Feeling your anatomy breaking me down
Sucking on my (mmm) with ice in your mouth
Hurry and undress me take me right now
I'm wet for you boy
Ooooooh
Caught up in the waves of passion up &amp; down
Love the way you movin' my body all around 
Boy you know you make the rain come down
You know how to make my rain come down 
Feel my, rain come
Pourin', soakin'
Longin', your lips
Baby ooh
You make it so moist
When my, ocean's, overflowin'
Afterglowin'
Take me ooh
You make me so moist...moist...moist...moist
Ooooooh
Ooooooh...yeah
You're feelin' in it...yeah
You're ticklin' it...yeah
You're swimmin' in it...yeah
You're gonna get it...moist 
You're feelin' in it...moist  
You're ticklin' it...moist  
You're swimmin' in it

You're gonna get it...yeah
You're feelin' in it...yeah
You're ticklin' it...yeah
You're swimmin' in it...yeah
You're gonna get it...moist
You're feelin' in it...moist
You're ticklin' it...moist
You're swimmin' in it
You're gonna get it
Feel my, rain come
Pourin', soakin'
Longin', your lips
Baby ooh
You make it so moist
When my, ocean's, overflowin'
Afterglowin'
Take me ooh

Feel my, rain come
Pourin', soakin'
Longin', your lips
