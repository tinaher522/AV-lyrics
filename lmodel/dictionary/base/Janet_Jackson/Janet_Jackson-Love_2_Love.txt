<song artist="Janet_Jackson" title="Love_2_Love">
We are a couple
Whose love knows no bounds
And pleasure is double
Whenever you're around
Love is much deeper
When you make it like this
And nothing is sweeter
When the two are mixed
Your kiss has got a poetry
That leaves me shakin' in the knees
Oh baby
And when you joing in the action
I can hardly breathe
Love 2 love you
I wanna touch you too
Please share my groove, ooh
I don't deny this is the love for me
Wait, don't move
I wanna taste you too
Damn baby ooh
You both bring me the kinda of joy I need
Now when we get on a roll
Sugar there's no slowing down
You're just like me so you know
How to make it all come out
And yeah, I can't forget about you no baby
How you touch, lick, kiss
Stroking my love
The way that you do
Your kiss has got a poetry
That gets leaves me shakin' in the knees
Ooh baby
And when you join in the action
I can hardly breathe
Damn baby
Love 2 love you
I wanna touch you too
Please share my groove, ooh
I don't deny this is the love for me
Wait, don't move
I wanna taste you too
Damn baby ooh
You both bring me the kinda of joy I need
Love 2 love
Fantasy, but it's more than just
A dream I am in ecstasy
My wish is to give to you
All of the thrills you give
To me now lemme feel
All of you
And while I'm feelin' baby
You have your way make me
Your slave, I will behave
Play all the games
Just for you
Love 2 love you
And I wanna taste you
While I'm touching you baby
I can't wait to feel ya
Love 2 love you
And I love how you love me too
