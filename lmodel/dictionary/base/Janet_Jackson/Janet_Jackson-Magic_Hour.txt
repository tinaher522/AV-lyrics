<song artist="Janet_Jackson" title="Magic_Hour">
The Magic Hour (it's all I wanna do)
That's my...the ultimate for me
When it's almost dark
The sun is goin' down
And there's still that little bit of light left
That breeze is still there and it's still hot out
That...that is just complete heaven for me
