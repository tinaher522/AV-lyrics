[CHORUS] 
Go deep 
No sleep 
All night 
Go deep 
Repeat 
Go deep 
Real deep 
Go deep 
(repeat x2) 
[Janet Verse One] 
I'm feeling fine cause in time I'll be out tonight 
I'm starting now making sure I look fine tonight 
Call Rene and Boo gotta meet them soon 
Tell T to call Shawn 
I'll be there at 1 
When we show up 
All the guys at the club 
Wanna get our backs 
We look good in black 
[Repeat CHORUS] 
[Janet - Verse Two] 
I'm feeling high cause I'm outta control tonight (can you feel it) 
(Feeling high don't wanna stop) 
Ooh he's got me moving 
DJ grooving I feel way right 
(Grooving I don't wanna stop) 
I'm getting freaked from behind 
I don't even mind 
Cause he's looking damn fine 
Make him mine in time 
Gotta take him home 
When I get him all alone 
I'll make him scream and moan (moan) 
[Repeat CHORUS] 
[Janet] 
We'll go deep 
Get no sleep 
And uh we'll til the (yea uh) 
I'm feeling high tonight 
Outta control tonight 
I'm feeling high tonight 
I feel high 
[Missy Elliott] 
Yeah 
I can go deeper than the river 
Timbaland 
Make a beat that will shiver 
The back of your cars 
The back of your jeeps (what) 
The tip of your neck 
The soles on your feet (what) 
Black 
My ha-hat-rat-tat (uh) 
Tat-tat-tat 
Now duplicate that (what) 
You sound wack 
Here's a smack 
Janet don't play that 
Timbaland give me playback 
[Repeat CHORUS til fade]
