<song artist="Janet_Jackson" title="All_My_Love_To_You">
Why do you have me runnin' every night and day?
We make good lovin' and now you tell me I can't stay
I live alone and I need someone to come home to
I hope and pray that someday that it will be you
Chorus:
All I wanna do is give, baby, all my love to you
Ever since we've been alone
I just can't stop thinkin' of, of you
Nothing could change my mind
'Cause I love the way you hold me tight
It was my very first time
Your security, I need it every night
Gonna give all my love to you, baby, that's what I'm gonna do
Gonna give all my love to you, baby, that's what I'm gonna do
Don't waste your time tellin' me not to come around
Your love for me is the only one that I have found
Don't try to hide and ignore me, drive me crazy
'Cause I'm for sure you're my first love and I'm your lady
Repeat Chorus
You're tryin' to change my mind and
It's not the way I planned it to be
And it's been a very long time since
You held me close, I need you desperately
Gonna give all my love to you, baby, that's what I'm gonna do
Gonna give all my love to you, baby, that's what I'm gonna do
Nothin' will change my mind
'Cause I love the way you hold me tight
And it was my very first time Your security...
Gonna give all my love to you, baby, that's what I'm gonna do
Gonna give all my love to you, baby, that's what I'm gonna do
Gonna give all my love to you, baby, that's what I'm gonna do
Gonna give all my love to you, baby, that's what I'm gonna do
