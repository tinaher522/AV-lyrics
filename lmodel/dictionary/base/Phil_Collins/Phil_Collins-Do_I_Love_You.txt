<song artist="Phil_Collins" title="Do_I_Love_You">
Do I want you for my baby?
Do I want you by my side?
Do I wanna run and kiss your lips?
Say you're my loving kind
Oh, oh
Do I love you?
Oh, yes I love you
Do I need your arms around me?
Do I live my life for you?
Do I always feel so warm each time
I look in your eyes of blue?
Oh, oh
Do I love you?
Oh, yes I love you
Oh, oh
And do I need you every minute of the day
And would I die if you should ever go away?
And does it mean so much
To feel your tender touch?
Do I love you?
(Do I love you?)
Really love you
(Really, really love you)
Oh, I swear I'm gonna get you
If it takes me all my life
I'll hope and pray that you may say
That you're gonna be my wife
Oh, oh
Do I love you?
Oh, yes I love you
Oh, oh
Do I love you?
Yes I love you
Do I love you?
Yes I love you
Do I love you?
Yes I love you
Do I love you?
Yes I love you
