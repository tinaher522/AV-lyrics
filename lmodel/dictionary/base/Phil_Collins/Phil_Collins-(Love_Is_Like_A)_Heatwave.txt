<song artist="Phil_Collins" title="(Love_Is_Like_A)_Heatwave">
Whenever I'm with her
Well, something inside
Starts to burnin'
And I'm filled with desire
Could it be the devil in me
Or is this the way love's supposed to be?
It's like a heatwave
Burning in my heart
(It's like a heatwave)
Can't keep from cryin'
(Heatwave)
It's tearing me apart
Whenever she calls my name
Whose soft flow, sweet, and plain
I feel, I feel
Feel that burning flame
Has high blood pressure got a hold on me
Or is this the way love's supposed to be?
It's like a heatwave
Burning in my heart
(It's like a heatwave)
Can't keep from cryin'
(Heatwave)
It's tearing me apart
Heatwave
Heatwave
Sometimes I stare in space
Tears all over my face
Can't explain it, don't understand it
I ain't never felt like this before
Well, that funny feeling has me amazed
Don't know what to do, my head's in a haze
Just like a heatwave
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh, you're in love, girl
Yes, this is the love girl
Ooh, girl, get it, girl
Ooh, you know this is love, girl
(Ain't nothin' but love, girl)
Don't pass up this chance
It could be true romance
Heatwave
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Burning, burning, burning
Burning, burning, burning
Burning, burning, burning
