<song artist="Phil_Collins" title="River_So_Wide">
If we can cross at the place that devides us
Cross the river, the river so wide
If we can smuther the pain that's inside us
deny the demons, that wait by our side
We can find, find the light
The nights are filled with the light of the same moon
We share the comfort of the same stars
The days are bright with the light of the same sun
That don't matter, can't you see what we are
What we are, what we become
Keep out sights on the way ahead
Don't look back, it won't help us now
The storm we left so far behind
Seems a dark memory
It starts to fade
Untill we see the light, we will not be safe
We're all sink or swim in the same ocean
Break our skin and we will bleed
Our minutes pass with the same motion
We face the same danger, we share the same needs
Ah, we're all the same
You and me
Keep our sights on the way ahead
Don't look back that won't help us now
'Cos upstream the river, it gets to wide
So we must build that bridge
Right here, 'cos if we wait we will not reach the other side
You see under clear blue sky
The winds have changed and blowing hard and long
And there not stop to rest 'cos the change is gonna come
Our nights are filled with the light of the same moon
Share the comfort of the same stars
Our days are bright with the light of the same sun
That don't matter, can't you see what we are
What we are, what we become
Keep our sights on the way ahead
Don't look back that won't help us now
'Cos upstream teh river, it gets to wide
And if we don't build that bridge right here, right now
You know we'll never ever reach the other side
