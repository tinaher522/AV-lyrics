<song artist="Phil_Collins" title="Loving_You_Is_Sweeter_Than_Ever">
I remember yet before we met when every night and day
I had to live the life of a lonely one
And I remember meeting you, discovering love could be so true
When shared by two instead of only one
When you said you loved me
(When you said you loved me)
When we could not be parted
(We could not be parted)
Well, I built my world around you
(Built my world around you)
And I'm thankful that I found you
Because loving you has made my life
Sweeter than ever, I never felt like this before
Loving you has made my life
So much sweeter than ever
Well, each night I pray we'll never part 'cause all the love within my heart
Grows stronger from day to day
As best I can and how I try, to reassure you, satisfy
'Cause I'd be lost if you went away
Because I really need you
(I really, really need you)
And I need for you to need me, too
(Need for you to need me too)
Well, I have built my world around you
(I built my world around you)
I'm so thankful that I've found you
Loving you has made my life
Sweeter than ever, I never felt like this before
Loving you is sweeter than ever
Oh yeah
Because I really love you
(I really, really love you)
And I'm thankful that you love me, too
(I'm thankful that you love me, too)
I have built my world around you
(Built my world around you)
And I'm truly glad I've found you
Because loving you has made my life
Sweeter than ever, I never felt like this before
Loving you has made my life
So much sweeter than ever, yes, it has
Loving you has made my life
Sweeter than ever
