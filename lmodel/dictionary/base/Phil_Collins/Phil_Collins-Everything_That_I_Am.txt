Young Tarzan
Will someone tell me where I belong?
Where I should go
Can someone tell me where I am going wrong?
I need to know
Tarzan
Is this my past here before me
Is this my story unfolding?
It's all here to discover
Everything that I am
Can this be what I've been seeking?
All my life I've been waiting for this
And now these memories
Will they make me see more?
Ooh I want to know where I belong
I want to know where I came from
I want to know the reason why I'm here
The way I am
Feeling the things I feel
Is this my family?
Can it really be them that I see?
My father and mother
And in their arms can it really be me
All these emotions
I can barely control
Cause the family I had
Is not the family I know?
Ooh and I got to know where I belong
I got to know where I came from
I got to know the reason why I'm here
The way I am
Feeling the things I feel
These spirits calling me
Familiar voices haunting
Disappearing taunting me
This is the choice I must make
Cause I know where I belong
I know where I, I came from
I know the reason why
I must decide
And leave here
The man I am inside
The future is clear for me to see
To be the man I'm meant to be
Like my father with my head up high
Standing tall
And proud of all
That I am
I'm a man!
