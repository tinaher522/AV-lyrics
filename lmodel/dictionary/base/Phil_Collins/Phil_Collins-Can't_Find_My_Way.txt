<song artist="Phil_Collins" title="Can't_Find_My_Way">
I've been doing some thinking, here on my own
it's been on my mind
this debt I owe to you
I have to repay in kind
But I can't find my way
Tired and weary, I follow the path
that leads to your door
but it occurred to me, all that I have
is already yours
But I can't find my way
Oh, just to sit a while
Oh, just to sit and watch you smile
But I can't find my way
Keep the faith you say
to keep the faith I pray
be strong you say
just follow the light
Wheels keep turning but the close I get
the farther I seem
peace will only come
finding the peace within
But I can't find my way
