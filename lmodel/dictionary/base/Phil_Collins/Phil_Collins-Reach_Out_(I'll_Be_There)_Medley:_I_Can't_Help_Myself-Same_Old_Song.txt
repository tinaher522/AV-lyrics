<song artist="Phil_Collins" title="Reach_Out_(I'll_Be_There)_Medley:_I_Can't_Help_Myself-Same_Old_Song">
Now if you feel that you can't go on
Because all of your hope is gone
And your life is filled
With much confusion
Until happiness is just an illusion
And your world around is crumblin' down
Darlin' (reach out)
Come on girl reach on out for me
Reach out for me
I'll be there
With a love that will shelter you
I'll be there
With a love that will see you through
When you feel lost and about to give up
'Cause your best just ain't good enough
And you feel the world has grown cold
And you're driftin' out all on your own
And you need a hand to hold
Darlin' (reach out)
Come on girl reach on out for me
Reach out for me
I'll be there to love and comfort you
And I'll be there
To cherish and care for you
I'll be there to always see you through
I'll be there to love and comfort you
I can tell the way you hang your head
You're alone and now you're afraid
And through your tears you look around
But there's no peace of mind to be found
I know what you're thinkin'
You're alone now, no love of your own but
Darlin' (reach out)
Come on girl reach on out for me
Reach out for me
Just look over your shoulder
I'll be there to give you all the love you need
And I'll be there, you can always depend on me
I'll be there
