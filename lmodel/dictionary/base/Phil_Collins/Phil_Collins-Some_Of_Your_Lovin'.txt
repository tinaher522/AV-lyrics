<song artist="Phil_Collins" title="Some_Of_Your_Lovin'">
You gotta give me some
Give me some of your lovin'
You gotta give me some of your lovin'
Now I'm not a greedy guy
So don't ask me why
Just give me some
Some of your lovin'
Oh, oh, oh, oh
And I don't expect you to guarantee
Your faith and devotion to only me
I'm aware you got a lot of wild oats to sow
But baby, when I need you, don't you tell me no
You gotta give me some
Some of your lovin'
You gotta give me some of your lovin'
Now I'm not a jealous child
My demands are mild
Just give me some
Some of your lovin'
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Now I know a girl likes to feel
She's been around
Before she decides to settle down
I've no doubt some day
You're gonna feel that way too
But baby, just remember
Until you do
You gotta give me some
Some of your lovin'
You gotta give me some of your lovin'
Now I'm not a greedy man
But I don't wanna pick
Just give me some
Some of your lovin'
Oh, oh, oh, oh
You gotta give me some
Oh yes, you do now
You gotta give me some
Some of your lovin'
Well, I need to tell you
Oh, I need your love so bad
You gotta give me some
Some of your lovin'
You gotta give me some
Give me some of your lovin'
You gotta give me some
Give me some of your lovin'
