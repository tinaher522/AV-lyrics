<song artist="Phil_Collins" title="Something_About_You">
Darlin', darlin'
If I could have you to call my very own
I'd work my fingers through the bone, I'd be alone
To you I'd always come home
'Cause there's something about you, baby
That makes me keep loving you
There's something about you, baby
Makes me love you just a little bit more
Truly does, just a little bit more
Sweet sweet thing, I'm satisfied
Sweet sweet thing, you set my soul on fire
I need you, got to have ya
No matter what price I have to pay
'Cause without the feel of your lovin' arms
I don't need a thing, right away
'Cause there's something about you, baby
That makes me keep loving you
There's something about you, baby
Makes me love you just a little bit more
Truly does, just a little bit more
Sweet sweet thing, I'm satisfied
Sweet sweet thing, you're my only desire
I'm just your puppet on a string
And tears sometimes it brings
But do me any way you wanna when you wanna
I'll keep lovin' you just the same
'Cause there's something about you, baby
That makes me keep loving you
Yeah there's something about you, baby
Makes me love you just a little bit more
Truly does, just a little bit more
You're a real smooth operator
You're a devil in disguise
There's something about you
That shakes me all up inside
You're a real heart breaker
And I need you just the same
Something about you, baby
Something about you
