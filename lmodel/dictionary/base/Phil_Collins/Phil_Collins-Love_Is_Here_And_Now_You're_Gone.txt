<song artist="Phil_Collins" title="Love_Is_Here_And_Now_You're_Gone">
Love is here
And oh, my darling, now you're gone
Love is here
And oh, my darling, now, now you're gone
You persuaded me to love you and I did
But instead of tenderness
I found heartache instead
Into your arms, I fell
So unaware of the loneliness
That was waiting there
You closed the door
And then you turned away
Love is here
And oh, my darling, now you're gone
You made me love you
And oh, my darling, now you're gone
You said loving you
Would make life beautiful
With each passing day
But as soon as love
Came into my heart
You turned and you walked
Just walked away
Without your love
Oh, look at me now
Look at me
See, what loving you has done to me
Look at my face
See how cryin' has left it's trace
After you made me all your own
And you left me all alone
Well, you made your words sound oh, so sweet
Knowing that your love, I could not keep
My heart is crying
Ooh, 'cause now you're gone
Love is here
Now, now you're gone
Love is here
Oh, my darling, now you're gone
Love is here
What are you doin' to me?
