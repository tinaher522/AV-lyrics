<song artist="Phil_Collins" title="Standing_In_The_Shadows_Of_Love">
Standing in the shadows of love
I'm getting ready for the heartache to come
Can't you see me standing in the shadows of love
Tryin' my best to get ready for the heartaches to come
I want to run but there's no place to go
'Cause heartaches will follow me I know
Without your love the love I need
It's the beginning of the end for me
'Cause you've taking away all my reason for living
When you pushed aside all the love I been giving
Didn't I treat you right now baby didn't I
Didn't I do the best for I could now didn't I
So don't leave me standing in the shadows of love
I'm getting ready for the heartaches to come
Don't you see me standing in the shadows of love
Tryin' my best to get ready for the heartaches to come
All alone I'm destined to be
With misery my only company
It might come today, it might come tomorrow
But it's for sure I ain't got nothing but sorrow
Now don't your conscience kind of bother you
How can you watch me cry after all I done for you
Now hold on a minute
Givin' you all the love I had no didn't I
When you needed me I was always there now wasn't I
Standing in the shadows of love
Getting ready for the heartaches to come
I'm trying not to cry out loud
'Cause I know cryin', it ain't gonna help me now
Now what did I do to cause all this grief
What did I say, to make you wanna leave
Now wait a minute
Gave my heart and soul to you now didn't I
And didn't I always treat you good now didn't I
I'm standing in the shadows in the love
I'm getting ready for the heartache to come
Can't you see me, standing in the shadows of love
Tryin' my best to get ready for the heartache to come
Oh, standing in the shadows of love
I'm getting ready for the heartache to come
