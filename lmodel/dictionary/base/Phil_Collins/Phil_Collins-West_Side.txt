<song artist="Phil_Collins" title="West_Side">
There's a place for us, somewhere a place for us
Peace and quiet and open air wait for us somewhere
There's a time for us,
Someday a time for us
Time together with time to spare
Time to look, time to care
Someday, somewhere,
We'll find a new way of living
We'll find a way of forgiving
Somewhere.
There's a place for us
A time and place for us
Hold my hand and we're halfway there
Hold my hand and I'll take you there
Somehow, someday, somewhere.
