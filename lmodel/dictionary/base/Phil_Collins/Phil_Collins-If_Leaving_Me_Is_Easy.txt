<song artist="Phil_Collins" title="If_Leaving_Me_Is_Easy">
I read all the letters...
I read each word that you've sent to me
And though its past now, and your words...
All the memories I've had, still remain
I've kept all the pictures, but I hide my feelings so no-one knows
Oh sure my friends all come 'round, 
But I'm in a crowd, and own my own
It's cos you're gone now, but your heart... heart still remains
And it'll be here if you come again
You see I'd heard the rumours
I knew before you let me know
But I didn't believe it, not you
No, you would not let me go
Seems I was wrong, 
But I love,  love you the same
And that's the one thing that you can't take away 
But just remember...
If leaving me is easy,
Then you know, coming back is harder
If leaving me is easy,
Then you know, coming back is harder
Hoh...
