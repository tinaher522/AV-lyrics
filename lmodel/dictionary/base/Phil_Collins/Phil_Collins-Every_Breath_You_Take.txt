<song artist="Phil_Collins" title="Every_Breath_You_Take">
Every breath you take
And every move you make
Every bond you break, every step you take
I'll be watching you
Every single day
And every word you say
Every game you play, every night you stay
I'll be watching you
Oh, can't you see
You belong to me?
How my poor heart aches
With every step you take
Every move you make
Every vow you break
Every smile you fake, every claim you stake
I'll be watching you
Since you've gone I've been lost without a trace
I dream at night, i can only see your face
I look around, but it's you i can't replace
I feel so cold, and i long for your embrace
I keep crying baby, baby please,
Oh, can't you see
You belong to me?
How my poor heart aches
With every step you take
Every move you make
Every vow you break
Every smile you fake, every claim you stake
I'll be watching you
Every move you make, every step you take
I'll be watching you
I'll be watching you
