<song artist="Phil_Collins" title="Thru_My_Eyes">
It's never where you think you'll find it
The thing you think you're looking for
It could take you all your lifetime
And still you'd never quite be sure
You could look everywhere
Because you know it's there
Soemwhere beneath the sky
But too closely and you'll get burned
There's no lesson learned
Yet some people pass it by
You'll see the things different when you look thru my eyes
Things are different if you see what I see
Just look closely and you'll see thru my eyes
It could be different, you'll see how it could be,
If you can see
You may need help to find your way home
Those who brought you here have flown
The road you take is full of hope or sadness
The choice you make will be your own
But you're not alone in there
Just say hello in there
Cos there are many just like you
They'll help you find someway
To make it all the way
They'll tell you all you have to do
You'll see the things different when you look thru my eyes
Things are different if you see what I see
Just look closely and you'll see thru my eyes
It could be different, you'll see how it could be,
If you can see
No one warns you of the heartache
No one can hide you from the storm
But from the shadows there will come the sunshine
A place to dry and keep you warm
Though no one tells you how
Your heart's beating faster now
Getting stronger day by day
Suddenly it's clear, what you seek is near
It's what you learn along the way
It's never where you think you'll find it
The thing you think you're looking for
Well it could take you all your lifetime
Still you'll never quite be sure
You'll find it, just look closer
