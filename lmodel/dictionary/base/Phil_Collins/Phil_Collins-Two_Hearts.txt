<song artist="Phil_Collins" title="Two_Hearts">
Well there was no reason to believe
She'd always be there
But if you don't put faith in what you're believin'
It's getting ya nowhere
And it teaches you to never give up
Don't look down, just look up
'Cause she's always there behind you
Just to remind you
Two hearts living in just one mind
You know it, two hearts living in just one mind
Well there was no easy way to
To understand it
'Cause there's so much of my life in her
And it's like I planned it
And it teaches you to never let go
There's so much love you'll never know
She can reach you, no matter how far
Wherever you are
Two hearts living in just one mind
Beating together till the end of time
You know it, two hearts living in just one mind
Together forever till the end of time
Well she knows, there'll always be a special place in my heart for her
She knows, she knows, she knows
Yeah she knows (she knows), no matter how far apart we are, she knows
I'm always right there beside her
We're two hearts living in just one mind
Beating together until the end of time
You know it, two hearts, but living in, living in just one mind
Together forever till the end of time
You know it, two hearts living in just one mind
Just one mind, just one mind until the end of time
You know it, two hearts, but living in just one mind
Beating together forever till the end of time
