<song artist="Phil_Collins" title="Papa_Was_A_Rolling_Stone">
It was the third of September
That day I'll always remember, yes, I will
'Cause that was the day that my daddy died
I never got a chance to see him
Never heard nothin' but bad things about him
Momma, I'm depending on you to tell me the truth
Momma hung her head and said
Papa was a rolling stone
Where ever he laid his hat was his home
And when he died, all he left us was alone
Papa was a rolling stone
Wherever he laid his hat was his home
And when he died, all he left us was alone
Hey momma, is it true what they say
That papa never worked a day in his life?
And momma, there's some bad talk goin' 'round town
That papa had three outside children and another wife
Heard some talk about papa doing some store front preachin'
Talked about saving souls and all the time leaching
Dealing in debt, stealing in the name of the law
Momma hung her head and said
Papa was a rolling stone
Wherever he laid his hat was his home
And when he died, all he left us was alone
Son, papa was a rolling stone, yeah, you know it
Wherever he laid his hat was his home
And when he died, all he left us was alone
Oh yeah
Come on, tell me, hey momma
I heard papa called himself a jack of all trades
Tell me is that what sent papa to an early grave
Folks say papa would beg, borrow, steal
To pay his bills
Folks say papa never was much on thinking
Spent most of his time chasing women and drinking
Momma, I'm depending on you to tell me the truth
Papa was a rolling stone
Wherever he laid his hat was his home
And when he died, all he left us was alone
You know, papa was a rolling stone
Wherever he laid his hat was his home
And when he died, all he left us was alone
[Incomprehensible]
Papa was a rolling stone, yeah, you know it
Wherever he laid his hat was his home
And when he died, all he left us was alone
Hey, you know how much you owe
Papa was a rolling stone
Wherever he laid his hat was his home
And when he died, all he left us was alone
Nothing but some bad days of [Incomprehensible]
Papa was a rolling stone
