<song artist="Phil_Collins" title="All_Of_My_Life">
All of my life, Ive been searching
For the words to say how I feel.
Id spend my time thinking too much
And leave too little to say what I mean
Ive tried to understand the best I can
All of my life.
All of my life, Ive been saying sorry
For the things I know I should have done
All the things I could have said come back to me
Sometimes I wish that it had just begun
Seems Im always that little too late
All of my life
Set em up, Ill take a drink with you
Pull up a chair, I think Ill stay
Set em up, cos Im going nowhere
Theres too much I need to remember, too much I need to say
All of my life, Ive been looking
But its hard to find the way
Reaching past the goal in front of me
While whats important just slips away
It doesnt come back but Ill be looking
All of my life
Set em up...
All of my life, there have been regrets
That I didnt do all I could
Making records upstairs, while he watched tv
I didnt spend the time I should
Its a memory I will live with
All of my life.
