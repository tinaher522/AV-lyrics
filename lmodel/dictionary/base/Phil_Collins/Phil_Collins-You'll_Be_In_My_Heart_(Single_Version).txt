<song artist="Phil_Collins" title="You'll_Be_In_My_Heart_(Single_Version)">
Come stop your crying, it will be all right
Just take my hand, hold it tight
I will protect you from all around you
I will be here dont you cry
For one so small,you seem so strong
My arms will hold you keep you safe and warm
This bond between us cant be broken
I will be here dont you cry
And youll be in my heart
Yes, youll be in my heart
From this day on
Now and forever more
Youll be in my heart
No matter what they say
Youll be here in my heart
Always
Why cant they understand the way we feel
They just dont trust what they cant explain
I know were different but deep inside us
Were not that different at all
And youll be in my heart
Yes, youll be in my heart
From this day on
Now and forever more
Youll be in my heart
No matter what they say
Youll be here in my heart
Always
Dont listen to them, cause what do they know
We need each other, to have and to hold
Theyll see in time, I know
When destiny calls you, you must be strong
I may not be with you, but you gotta hold on
Theyll see in time, I know
Well show them together cuz...
Youll be in my heart
I believe, youll be in my heart
Ill be there from this day on
Now and forever more
Youll be in my heart
No matter what they say
Youll be here in my heart always
Always...
Ill be with you
Ill be there for you always
Always and always
Just look over your shoulder
Just look over your shoulder
Just look over your shoulder
Ill be there always
