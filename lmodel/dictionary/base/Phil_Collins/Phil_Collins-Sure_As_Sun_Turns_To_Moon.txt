Kala
It's nice to see you play with the children
Kerchak
Why do you say that?
I do it all the time
Kala
You don't
Kerchak
I do
Kala
You don't
Kerchak
I don't?
Kala
You don't, you know?
It's nice to see you smiling and laughing
Kerchak
What do you mean?
I do it all the time
Kala
You don't
Kerchak
I do
Kala
You don't
Kerchak
I don't
Kala
No, you don't, you know
You're my husband
My friend, our leader
You're the one that I love completely
Kerchak
I am?
Kala
You are, you know you are
Kerchak
You can't imagine the weight on my shoulders
Kala
I know too well how hard it must be
Kerchak
You don't
Kala
I do
Kerchak
You don't
Kala
Oh yes I do, you know
You're my husband
My friend, our leader
But a little chink in your armor might be nice
Kerchak
Really?
Kala
It might be nice
BOTH
There was sunshine
There was family
There was our life, side by side
This was home
Kala
As sure as sun turns to moon will I love you
Kerchak
And I will be there to answer your call
Kala
You will?
Kerchak
I will
Kala
You really will?
Kerchak
I swear I will
Kala
It would be nice to see you more often
Kerchak
Why don't you come back for I miss you so
Kala
You do?
Kerchak
I do
Kala
But you know I can't come back alone
