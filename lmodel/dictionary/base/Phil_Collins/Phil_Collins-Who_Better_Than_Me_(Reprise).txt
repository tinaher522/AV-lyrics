<song artist="Phil_Collins" title="Who_Better_Than_Me_(Reprise)">
TERK:
You need a friend
Some timely intervention
Some tough love to save you from yourself
So it's me to get your attention
'Cause who better than me
To save you
Who better than me
To make you change your mind
There's no doubt
You're not controlling your emotions
You're hard-headed
And stubborn too
There's no one else with my devotion
So who better than me
To show you
Who better than me
To convince you you're wrong
TARZAN:
Terk, listen
My eyes are wide-open
I'm seeing clear
I feel oh, so alive
For once I'm happy to be me
And it feels good
Oh yes, it feels good
TERK:
With the eyes
And the tender persuasion
I feel a duty
To help you through
And though I still can't
See the attraction
TERK:
Who better than me?
Who better than me?
Who better than me?
Who better than me?
TARZAN:
Nobody but you
May take this the way
To help me
TERK AND TARZAN:
To make this dream come true
TERK:
Who better than me
To help him
Who better than me
To put a smile on his face
Who better than me
His best-friend
Who better than me
To make his dreams come true
Oh (Riffing)
Yeah!
