<song artist="Phil_Collins" title="I've_Forgotten_Everything">
I've forgotten everything about you
'til someone says your name
I've forgotten all the reasons I loved you
'til someone tells me that you rang
The memories are hazy now
I don't recall at all
there's nothing, there's nothing there
just me
and I don't understand why
I can't recollect my feelings
'til someone mentions that they saw you
I really don't remember all the things you said
'til someone shows me where you live
Why is everything so hazy now
I don't recall at all
there's nothing, there's nothing there
just me
and I don't understand why
I can't recall your smile
the touch of your hand holding mine
and I can't remember why
holding you seemed so right
The memories they're hazy now
I don't recall at all
there's nothing, there's nothing there
just me
and I don't understand why
I've forgotten everything about you
'til someone says your name
I've forgotten all the reasons I loved you
'til someone tells me that you rang
