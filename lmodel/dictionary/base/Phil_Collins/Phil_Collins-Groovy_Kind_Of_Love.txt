<song artist="Phil_Collins" title="Groovy_Kind_Of_Love">
When I'm feeling blue, all I have to do
Is take a look at you, then I'm not so blue
When you're close to me, I can feel your heart beat
I can hear you breathing in my ear
Wouldn't you agree, baby you and me, we've got a groovy kind of love
Any time you want to, you can turn me on to
Anything you want to, any time at all
When I kiss your lips, ooh I start to shiver
Can't control the quivering inside
Wouldn't you agree, baby you and me, we've got a groovy kind of love, oho
(Solo)
When I'm feeling blue, all I have to do
Is take a look at you, then I'm not so blue
When I'm in your arms, nothing seems to matter
My whole world could shatter, I don't care
Wouldn't you agree, baby you and me, we've got a groovy kind of love
We've got a groovy kind of love, we've got a groovy kind of love
Oho, we've got a groovy kind of love
