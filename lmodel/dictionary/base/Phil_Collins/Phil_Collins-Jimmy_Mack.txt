<song artist="Phil_Collins" title="Jimmy_Mack">
Jimmy Mack, Jimmy, oh Jimmy Mack
When are you coming back?
Jimmy Mack, Jimmy, oh Jimmy Mack
When are you coming back?
My arms are missing you
And her lips feel the same way too
I tried so hard to be true
Like I promised I'd do
But your girl keeps coming around
She's trying to wear my resistance down
Hey Jimmy, Jimmy, oh Jimmy Mack
When are you coming back?
Jimmy, Jimmy, oh Jimmy Mack
You better hurry back
Well, she calls me on the phone
About three times a day
But now my heart's just listening to
What he has to say
But this loneliness I have within
Keeps reaching out to be his friend
Oh, Jimmy, Jimmy, oh Jimmy Mack
When are you coming back?
Oh, Jimmy, Jimmy, oh Jimmy Mack
You better hurry back
She needs your loving
She needs your loving
I wanna say, I'm not getting any stronger
I can't hold out very much longer
Tell me how to be true
'Cause she says I chased it
They're sweet as you
Oh, Jimmy, Jimmy, oh Jimmy Mack
When are you coming back?
Jimmy, can you hear me, Jimmy, oh Jimmy Mack
You better hurry back
She needs your loving
She needs your loving
Jimmy Mack, oh, you better hurry back
Jimmy Mack, yeah, you better hurry back
Come on Jimmy Mack, oh, you better hurry back
Jimmy Mack
