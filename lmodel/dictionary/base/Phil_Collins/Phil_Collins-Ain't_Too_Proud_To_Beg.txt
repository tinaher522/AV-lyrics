<song artist="Phil_Collins" title="Ain't_Too_Proud_To_Beg">
I know you wanna leave me,
But I refuse to let you go
If I have to beg and plead for your sympathy,
I don't mind 'cause you mean that much to me
Ain't too proud to beg, sweet darlin'
Please don't leave me girl, don't you go
Ain't to proud to plead, baby, baby
Please don't leave me, girl, don't you go
Now I heard a cryin' man,
Is half a man with no sense of pride
But if I have to cry to keep you,
I don't mind weepin' if it keeps you by my side
Oh I ain't to proud to beg,
Please don't leave me girl, don't you go
Ain't to proud to plead, baby, baby
Please don't leave me girl, don't you go
If I have to sleep on your doorstep
All night and day just to keep you from walkin' away
Let your friends laugh, even this I can stand
Because I wanna keep ya any way I can
Ain't too proud to beg,
Please don't leave me girl, don't you go
Ain't to proud to plead, baby, baby
Please don't leave me girl, don't you go
Well I gotta love so deep in the pit of my heart
And each day it grows more and more
I'm not ashamed to crawl and plead to you baby
If pleadin' keeps you from walkin' out that door
Oh I ain't too proud to beg,
Please don't leave me girl, don't you go
Ain't to proud to plead, baby, baby
Please don't leave me girl, don't you go
Ain't too proud to beg, oh you know it
Please don't leave me girl, don't you go
Ain't to proud to plead, baby, baby
Please don't leave me girl, don't you go
