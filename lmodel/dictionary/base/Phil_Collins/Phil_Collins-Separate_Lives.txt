<song artist="Phil_Collins" title="Separate_Lives">
You called me from the room in your hotel
All full of romance for someone that you met
And telling me how sorry you were
Leaving so soon
And that you miss me sometimes
When you're alone in your room
Do I feel lonely too?
You have no right to ask me how I feel
You have no right to speak to me so kind
I can't go on, just holding on to ties
Now that we're living (living) separate lives
Well I have learned to let you go
And if you've lost your love for me
Will you never let it show (never let it show)
There was no way to compromise
So now we're living (living) separate lives
Ooh, it's so typical, love leads to isolation
So you build that wall (build that wall)
Yes, you build that wall
And you make it stronger (build that wall)
Well you have no right to ask me how I feel
You have no right to speak to me so kind
Someday I might (I might) find myself looking in your eyes
But for now we'll go on living separate lives
Yes for now we'll go on living separate lives
Ah
Separate lives
