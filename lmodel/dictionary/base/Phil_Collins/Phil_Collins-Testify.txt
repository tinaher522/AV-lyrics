Testify
I want to be testify, testify my love for you
I'm here to testify, testify my love for you
And I will do, all that I can do for you
Together, we will be together
Come on testify, testify your love for me
Testify, testify your love for me
You can be all the things you want to be
And together, we will be together
Every heart that's ever been broken
Knows these things must not go unspoken
Giving yourself, giving each other
The strength to lean on one another
I'll be there for you, you'll be here for me
That is why I want to testify, testify my faith in you
Come on and testify, testify your trust in me
We can be all the things we want to be
And together, we can do it together
Every heart that's ever been broken
Knows these things must not go unspoken
Giving yourself, giving each other
The strength to lean on one another
I'll be there for you, you'll be here for me
I want to be testify, testify my love for you
I'm here to testify, testify my love for you
And I will do, all that I can do for you
And you know together, we will always be together
