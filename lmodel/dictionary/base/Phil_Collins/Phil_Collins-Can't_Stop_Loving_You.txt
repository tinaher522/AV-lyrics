<song artist="Phil_Collins" title="Can't_Stop_Loving_You">
So you're leavin' 
In the mornin' 
On the early train.
Well I could say 
Everything's all right
And I could pretend 
And say goodbye.
Got your ticket,
Got your suitcase,
Got your leaving smile,
Though I could say that's the way it goes,
And I could pretend you won't know
That I was lying...
Cause I can't stop loving you,
No, I can't stop loving you,
No, I won't stop loving you,
Why should I?
We took a taxi,
To the station,
Not a word was said.
And I saw you walk across the road
For maybe the last time, I don't know.
Feeling humble
Heard a rumble on the railway track
And when I hear the whistle blow,
I'll walk away and you won't know,
That I'll be crying...
Cause I can't stop loving you,
No, I can't stop loving you,
No, I won't stop loving you,
Why should I?
Even try,
I'll always be here by your side.
Why, why, why?
I never wanted to say,
Why even try?
I'm always here, if you change,
Change your mind.
So you're leavin',
In the mornin',
On the early train.
Well, I could say everything's alright,
And I could pretend and say goodbye,
But that would be lying...
Cause I can't stop loving you,
No, I can't stop loving you,
No, I won't stop loving you,
Why should I?
Cause I can't stop loving you,
No, I can't stop loving you,
No, I won't stop loving you,
Why should I?
Why should I?
Why should I? tell me,
Why should I, even try?
