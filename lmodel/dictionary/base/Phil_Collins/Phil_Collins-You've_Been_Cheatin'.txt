<song artist="Phil_Collins" title="You've_Been_Cheatin'">
I've been trying hard to forget
That you've been cheating
Wishin' you I'd never met
'Cause you've been cheatin'
Can't you know lies can be seen in your eyes
And from wrong you'll never be free
While you sit cryin', you've been lyin'
You've been cheatin', cheatin' on me
Oh yeah
Yeah, you made me suspect and I know
You don't want me
Cookies crumble, and that's how it goes
You don't want me
Can't you know lies can be seen in your eyes
And from wrong you'll never be free
While you sit cryin', you've been lyin'
You've been cheatin', cheatin' on me
Oh yeah
Another lover you discover
Our love's gone and I don't know why
It's just as well, though at last I do know
All you said was just a lie
So I'm trying hard to forget
That you've been cheatin'
And wishin' you I'd never met
'Cause you've been cheating
Can't you know lies can be seen in your eyes
And from wrong you'll never be free
While you sit cryin', well you've been lyin'
Girl you've been cheatin', cheatin' on me
Ooh, ooh, baby (you've been cheating)
You been cheatin' (you've been cheating)
You been cheatin' on me (you've been cheating)
