<song artist="Phil_Collins" title="Ain't_That_Peculiar">
Honey you do me wrong but I'm still crazy about you
I stay away too long and I can't do without you
But every chance you get you seem to hurt me more and more
But each hurt makes my love grow stronger than before
I know flowers grow through rain
But how can love grow through pain, oh
Ain't that peculiar
A peculiar as can be
Ain't that peculiar baby
A peculiarality
Oh
You tell me lies that should be obvious to me
But I'm so much in love with you baby that I don't wanna see
That things you do and say are designed to make me blue
It's a dog gone shame my love for you makes all
Your lies seem true
But if the truth made love last longer
Why do lies make my love stronger
Ain't that peculiar
A peculiar as can be
Ain't that peculiar baby
A peculiarality
I cried so much just like a child that's lost it's toy
But maybe baby you think these tears I cry are tears of joy
But a child can cry so much until you do everything they say
But unlike a child my tears don't help me to get my way
I know love can last through years
But how can love last through tears
Ain't that peculiar
A peculiarality
Ain't that peculiar baby
A peculiar as can be
I don't understand it baby,
Don't understand it
Peculiar as can be
