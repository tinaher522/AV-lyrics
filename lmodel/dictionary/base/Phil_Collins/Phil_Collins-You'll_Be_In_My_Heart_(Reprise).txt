<song artist="Phil_Collins" title="You'll_Be_In_My_Heart_(Reprise)">
Come stop your crying, it'll be all right
Just take my hand, hold it tight
I will protect you from all 'round you
I will be here, don't you cry
For one so small you seem so strong
My arms will hold you, keep you safe and warm
This bond between us can't be broken
I will be here, don't you cry
'Cause you'll be in my heart
Yes, you'll be in my heart
From this day on
Now and forevermore
Come stop your crying, it'll be all right
Just take my hand, hold it tight
I will protect you from all around you
I will be here, don't you cry
'Cause you'll be in my heart
Yes, you'll be in my heart
From this day on
Now and forevermore
Oh, you'll be in my heart
No matter what they say
You'll be here in my heart, always
Don't listen to them 'cause what do they know
We need each other to have, to hold
They'll see in time, I know
When destiny calls you, you must be strong
I may not be with you but you've got to hold on
They'll see in time, I know
We'll show them together
'Cause you'll be in my heart
Believe me, you'll be in my heart
From this day on
Now and forevermore
Yes, you'll be in my heart
No matter what they say
You'll be here in my heart, always
Always, always
