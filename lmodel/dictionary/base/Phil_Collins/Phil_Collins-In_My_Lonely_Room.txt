<song artist="Phil_Collins" title="In_My_Lonely_Room">
Girl, every single time
You take me out with you
You always flirt around
With someone new
But I never criticize
The tearful things you do
'Cause I'm so afraid
Of losing you
But in my lonely room
Tears I don't have to hide
'Cause I just lock my door
And let myself go
I lay right, I lay right down and cry
Every place we go
People are whispering
About your flirting ways
And it hurts me so to hear
Oh in the public's eye
I just push behind
All my hurt inside
I pretend that I don't mind
But in my lonely room
Tears I don't have to hide
In my lonely room
Tears I don't have to hide
In my lonely room
Tears I don't have to hide
