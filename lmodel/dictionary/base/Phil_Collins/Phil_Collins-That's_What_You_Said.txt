<song artist="Phil_Collins" title="That's_What_You_Said">
I remember the night you weren't at home
(had to work late is what I heard)
That's what you said
I can never forget the way it felt,
you needed some time to work it out,
that's what you said
and now I feel a fool.
'Cos late at night I call your name,
I'm wondering what for,
'cos I've seen those other guys
sniffin' around your door.
Whatever happened to the words
'Lovers for all eternity?'
That's what you said,
I was your rome, you were my Juliet,
eternally
that's what you said
and now I feel a fool.
'Cos late at night I hear your voice
calling out my name,
oh I know it's just a dream
but every night's the same.
I carried a torch for you, through the thick and thin
you know it don't seem right that I won't see you again
No no
Late at night I call your name,
I'm wondering what for,
'cos I keep seeing those other guys
sniffin' around your door.
I carried a torch for you through the wind and rain
I'll never forget you, but I won't see you again
No no
I thought your friends all liked me
I thought I fitted in just right,
that's what you said.
Soon I'll be gone and you'll be free,
you can go find the things that you want.
That's what you said
and I won't feel a fool
'cos late at night I still call your name,
I'm wondering what for,
'cos I keep seeing those other guys
sniffin' around your door.
What for?
