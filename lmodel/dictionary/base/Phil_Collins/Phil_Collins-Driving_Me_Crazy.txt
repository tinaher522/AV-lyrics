<song artist="Phil_Collins" title="Driving_Me_Crazy">
No matter where you go Ill be there
No matter where you hide Ill find you
Ill be there looking through the window watching everything you do
Theres no escaping me
Ill be like your worst enemy
Im right behind you every place you run to Ill be there with you
Cos being without you is driving me crazy
Oh I just dont know what to do
Yes being without you is driving me crazy
Cos all I want is you .
And I like it
If all the worlds a stage and we are,
Were only just two crazy players
Please understand why I just cant go on without you anymore
Theres no escaping me
I want you back, cant you see
Im losing all control and cannot guarantee my sanity
Cos being without you is driving me crazy
And I dont know what to do
Yes being without you is driving me crazy
Cos all I want is you
Being without you is driving me crazy
I dont know how long Ill last
Being without you is driving me crazy
Feel my pulse its going so fast
You, youre driving me crazy
Me, Im out of my mind
You, youre making me crazy
Me, Im running out of time
I am your conscience, Im your guide
I know just what you feel inside
I share your darkest thoughts with you but share no consequences for them
Theres no escaping me
Im with you while you sleep
I hear your lies, I hear your truth
I hear you speak before you do
But being without you is driving me crazy
And I dont know what to do
Yes being without you is driving me crazy
Cos all I want is you
Being without you is driving me crazy
I dont know how long Ill last
Being without you is driving me crazy
Feel my pulse its going so fast
