<song artist="Phil_Collins" title="Different">
Tarzan
It's just like me yet
It's just so different
Where did it come from?
These things that got here
Are all so different
Where does it belong?
I've never seen its shape
It's just so different
Oh I must see more
Skin so soft
It smells so different
From all I've seen before
And yet here, we're just the same
My heart is beating faster
I must know more about her
There's something strange that draws me near her
She's nothing like I've seen before
She makes me feel so alive
Tarzan
Tarzan
Jane
Tarzan Oh I see
Tarzan
Tarzan Oh I see
Jane
Oh nononono, I'm Jane
Tarzan
Oh nononono, I'm Jane
Jane
Oh dear, no, My name is Jane Porter
Tarzan
Oh dear, no, My name is Jane Porte..
Jane
STOP
Tarzan, Jane
Tarzan
Tarzan, Jane
Jane
Exactly
Tarzan
I've never felt like this
I feel so different
Being so close to her
Something deep inside feels so different
Since everything has stirred
There's something so exciting
Somehow more so inviting
It feels so new yet so familiar
Something tells me I will never 
Ever be the same again
