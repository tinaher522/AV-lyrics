<song artist="Phil_Collins" title="No_Matter_Who">
Well it's a long, long road when you're out there alone,
no matter what side you're on,
but there's a heart of gold behind the smile
and it brought me to where I belong.
'Cos I'd set my sights on finding you
and I'm staying forever, you know it's true
Yes I'd set my sights on finding you
don't be lonely tonight, we can make it alright
No matter what you say,
no matter who you are,
love always finds a way
finds a way to your heart.
Well it's a cold lonely road, but you can survive
no matter which way you choose,
and as long as there's life behind these eyes
I'm here with you, win or lose.
If you let your light shine on through
someone will come round to pull you through,
yes just let your light shine on through,
don't be lonely tonight, you can make it alright.
Just hold my hand,
come with me a while, I'll make you smile.
Just hold my hand
there's someone who loves you, it's me, oh it's me.
No matter what you say,
no matter who you are,
love always finds a way
finds a way to your heart.
It's alright that you cry if you're lonely sometime,
no matter who's by your side,
'cos the love that you look for is inside us all,
but it's something you have to find
And I'd set my sights on finding you
and I'm staying forever, you know it's true.
Yes I'd set all my sights on findingyou
don't be lonely tonight, we can make it alright.
No matter what you say,
no matter who you are,
love always finds a way
finds a way to your heart.
