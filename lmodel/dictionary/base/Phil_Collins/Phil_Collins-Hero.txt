<song artist="Phil_Collins" title="Hero">
Well it was one of those great stories
that you can't put down at night
the hero knew what he had to do
and he wasn't afraid to fight
the villain goes to jail, while the hero goes free
I wish it were that simple for me.
And the reason that she loved him
was the reason I loved him too
and he never wondered what was right or wrong
he just knew - he just knew.
Shadows and shape mixed together at dawn
but by time you catch them simplicity's gone
and so we sort through the pieces
my friends and I
searching through the darkness to find
the breaks in the sky.
And the reason that she loved him
was the reason I loved him too
and he never wondered what was right or wrong
he just knew - he just knew.
And we wonder, yes we wonder
how do you make sense of this
when the hero kills the maiden
with his kiss - with his kiss.
Well it was one of those great stories
that you can't put down at night
the hero knew what he had to do
and he wasn't afraid to fight
the villain goes to jail, while the hero goes free
I wish it were that simple for me
- if it were that simple for me.
