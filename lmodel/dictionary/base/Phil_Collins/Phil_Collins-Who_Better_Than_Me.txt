TERK
You're one of a kind, I can't explain it
You're kind of cool, in a wonderful way
Though you're weird, you can make it
And who better than me to teach you
Who better then me to set you on your way. (Mhm)
This could take some hangin' in there
Though with persuasion I can take you on up
Make you grow up, beside the others
And who better than me to lead you
Who better than me to take you all the way (Hey hey hey yeah)
YOUNG TARZAN &amp; TERK
Struggling along for years and years
TERK
Until I came along for you
Now its all comin' together
YOUNG TARZAN &amp; TERK
And together will see this through
You for me and me for you
YOUNG TARZAN
I can learn, I can listen
I know there's something
Deep inside but
I need assistance to go the distance
TERK
And who better than me
YOUNG TARZAN
To teach me
TERK
Who better than me
YOUNG TARZAN
To tell me all you know
TERK
Who better than me
YOUNG TARZAN
You reach me
TERK
Who better than me
YOUNG TARZAN &amp; TERK
To show them all we know!
