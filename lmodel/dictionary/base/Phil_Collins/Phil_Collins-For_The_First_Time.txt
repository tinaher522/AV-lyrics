Jane
This affection I feel is hard to understand
It's not the way I planned
My world is changing
Wherever I turn 
It's his face I see
Looking back at me
And in my eyes I can't disguise
The affection I feel 
Is getting the better off me
Oh for the first time it's not a dream
Oh for the first time it seems so real 
That I want to remember 
Every moment
That I'm there beside him
When he gently takes my hand
So here I am
Feeling things I've  never felt
And all because of him
My world is changing
Tarzan
She's turned my whole world upside down
Jane
Everything that I do
I do to catch his eye
Well and I won't deny
I stand here guilty
Tarzan
I wonder if she feels the same
BothIs this affection (as) I feel
Has gotten the better of me
So for the first time
Can this be love?
Oh for the first time
I know it's real
Jane
And with him I feel
Both
So completely
Uniquely like no other
As he gently holds me close
Jane
But wait a minute
What am I saying?
Tarzan
Ne?er thought no
Jane
I never thought
On a scale so grand
Tarzan
To be feeling
Jane
Are these emotions 
Racing through me
Tell me I must
Tell me I can
Tarzan
I never felt these things
Both
I'm finding who I am
Cause for the first time
Jane
I have no doubt
Tarzan
These things she does
Both
But for the first time
I understand, try to understand
Yes for the first time
I realise
That all the things they strange/separate happened
Well they're happening to me
Jane
Every time I'm with that man
Tarzan
Every time I'm with her
Jane
Every time I'm with
Tarzan
Could I be
Both
That man
