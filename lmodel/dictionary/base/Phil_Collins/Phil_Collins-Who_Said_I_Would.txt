<song artist="Phil_Collins" title="Who_Said_I_Would">
I know she says she wants me, I hear it every day
And I know she knows it keeps me, well there ain't no other way
But she's got a heart, must be made of stone
'Cos when I tell her that she'll miss me when I'm gone, she says
Who said I would
She knows it ain't easy for a simple boy like me
She fills me full of lovin', oh, then she sets me free
But she's got a heart, must be made of stone
'Cos when I tell her that she'll miss me when I'm gone, she says
Who said I would
Tell me, who said I would
Who said I would (who said I would)
Who said I would
I'm not the only one, but I'll do fine
I suit her purpose and I'm just her kind
I don't own her and I never could
Don't think I do, don't think I should
Tell me, who said I would (who said I would)
Who said I would
But she's got a heart, must be made of stone
And when I tell her that she'll miss me when I'm gone, she says
You're not the only one, but you'll do fine
You suit my purpose and you're just my kind
You don't own me and you never could
Don't think you do, don't think you should
Who said I would (who said I would)
Now she knows when she calls me, I'll come running every time
And she knows she gets me hot, and she'll know it's her body, not her mind
And she's got a heart, must be made of stone
'Cos when I tell her that she'll miss me when I'm gone, she says
Who said I would
Tell me, who said I would
Who said I would
Who said I would
Who said I would
Who said I would
(who said I would)
(who said I would)
