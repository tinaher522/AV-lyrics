JANE
This man is not like other men
Like no man I've ever seen
You'll have to meet him to believe it
I know just how you'll be
Oh he defies all gravity
PROFESSOR PORTER
Oh, Jane can this be true
JANE
Like no man I've ever seen
PROFESSOR PORTER
My word
JANE
He seems to fly
Defying everything
PROFESSOR PORTER
No
JANE
Like something in your dreams
PROFESSOR PORTER
Good Heavens!
JANE/ PROFESSOR PORTER
Can this be true?
PROFESSOR PORTER
This man he sounds extraordinary!
JANE
He is father!
PROFESSOR PORTER
I'd love to meet him too
JANE
You shall...
PROFESSOR PORTER
Well does he talk?
Like you or I can?
JANE
Well...
PROFESSOR PORTER
And what do you two do?
JANE
I know this, he seems at one with nature
PROFESSOR PORTER
That's good
JANE
Like no man I ever seen
PROFESSOR PORTER
Hmm, he sound quiet nice
JANE
It seems he learned from all around him
They're like his friends you see
PROFESSOR PORTER
Really?!
JANE / PROFESSOR PORTER
Can this be true?
JANE
Oh father, sometimes I wake at night
And see him there
He lightens up the darkness you will see
PROFESSOR PORTER
Oh I can see...
Oh daughter what's this I hear?
It seems he fills your heart with joy
I see the symptoms in those eyes
I feel so happy, and proud of you inside...
So we both made our discoveries
JANE
Yes!
PROFESSOR PORTER
Though, I'll keep mine to myself
JANE
I'm not following you daddy.
PROFESSOR PORTER
But if my instincts serve correctly,
I may have lost my girl.
JANE 
Oh no no no no no!
JANE/PROFESSOR PORTER
Oh this is what we've waited for
We always knew one day
This is the link we've both been searching for
It's just a breath away
Can this be true?
Can this be true?
We'll see!
