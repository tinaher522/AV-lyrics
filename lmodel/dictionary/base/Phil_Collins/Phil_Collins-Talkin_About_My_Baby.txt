<song artist="Phil_Collins" title="Talkin_About_My_Baby">
I wanna talk about my baby, yeah, yeah
With her pretty smile, yeah, yeah
She's 'bout to drive me crazy, yeah, yeah
Makes my heart beat wild
So everybody say, yeah, yeah, yeah
Everybody say, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, everybody say, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I want to talk about my baby, yeah, yeah
She does the walk real nice, yeah, yeah
There's no questions about maybe
For her, I'd make any sacrifice
So everybody say, yeah, yeah, yeah
Let me hear you say, yeah, yeah, yeah
Let me hear you say, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
And when she walks that walk
I can't help but feel that she's for real
And when she talks that talk
I can't quite explain just how I feel
Talking about my baby
I want to talk about my baby, yeah, yeah
To me, she's everything, yeah, yeah
She might fuss and call me lazy
But to her, I'm still the king
So everybody say, yeah, yeah, yeah
Well, everybody say, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, everybody say, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Talking about my baby
You know we're talking about my baby
Talking about my baby
No one else but me
My baby and me
She's my baby, oh
[Incomprehensible]
