<song artist="Phil_Collins" title="Going_Back">
I think I'm going back
To the things I learned so well in my youth
I think I'm returning to
All those days when I was young enough to know the truth
Now there are no games to only pass the time
No more electric trains no more trees to climb
Thinking young and growing older is no sin
And I can play the game of life to win
Oh I can recall the time
When I wasn't ashamed to reach out to a friend
And now I think I've got
A lot more than just my toys to lend
Now there's more to do than watch myself for cry
And everyday can be my magic paradise
And I can play hide and seek with my fears
And live my days instead of counting my years
Let everyone debate the true reality
I'd rather see my world the way it used to be
A little bit of courage is all we lack
So catch me if you can 'cause I'm going back
I'm going back
Not just sitting, walking away
Yes, I'm going back
Going back to my youth though and
I'm going back
I'm going back
Going back to my youth
Come on, catch me 'cause I'm going back
I'm going back
