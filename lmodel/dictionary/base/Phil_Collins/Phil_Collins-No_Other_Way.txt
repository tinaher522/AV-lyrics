Kerchak
My worst fear
I hold it now
I always knew that this would happen
Though he's a child it's in his blood
And he will grow
So now it's clear what I must do
I know too well what he'll become
For as long as I draw breath
I'll remember
Kala
Where's Tarzan?
Where is he?
Kerchak
No turning back
What's done is done
I have seen what they can do
He can't be saved by you, by me
It's too late
Kala
No, I won't let you do this
How can you think'd
Kerchak
No more fighting I'll be obeyed
I'll stand my ground 
Don't dare defy me
I know his kind
I know the truth
I will protect us 
No other way
Open your eyes
It's there to see
No other way
He's not one of us
And never will be
Kala
Just listen to me
Kerchak
No more to say
He is what he is
And that won't change
There's no other way
I am leaving him here
And here he'll stay
Kala
He's just a child
Kerchak
He was up in the trees
Making a weapon
And in time it is us
He will hurt
Kala
No
Kerchak
Nothing and no one
Will stop him becoming
What he is
And was by blood
No other way
He won't come between me 
And those I loved
Believe me when I say
With my body and soul
This I vow
Kala
But I need him!
Kerchak
No, no other way
In spite of your pain
It will be done
No matter what you say
He never was or could be
Be my son
There is no other way
I won't let him near
The rest of the tribe again
Kala
I understand
Kerchak
Where are you going?
Kala
To find him
We'll live away from the family
Kerchak
For how long?
Kala
For as long as he needs me
Kerchak
You can't
I won't be able to protect you
Kala don't do this 
Please
Kala
Kerchak I'm his mother
Kerchak
No other way
I should have done this before
Long ago
And from today
Though they'll think of me cruel
They won't know
There was no other way.
