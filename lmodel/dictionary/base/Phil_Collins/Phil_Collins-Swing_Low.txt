<song artist="Phil_Collins" title="Swing_Low">
The sun is rising in the sky
Here were waiting, standing by
Round in circles, round and round
Pulse is racing, can't sit down
The noise of people fills the air
Search for silence goes nowhere
Time just passes, starts to rain
I look at you and I feel your pain
Day after day watching it grow, counting the time
In each and every way the pleasure is mine
Through all of the high times
Through all of the low times
The farther we reach, the farther we see
The farther we go
Time after time waiting for you, when will you come
Wanting to play the game we've begun
Through all of the high times
Through all of the low times
The more we can give, the more we can keep
The more there will be
Like the man said he was right
bout something coming in the air tonight
Well if its coming, let it be now
I feel its close, I just know somehow
I cant hold on much longer
My head is filled with wonder
But if these things don't come to pass
I'll bring you water and fill your glass
Everyday the stronger it grows, its easy to see
Getting to feel how good it can be
Through all of the high times
Through all of the low times
The more that we teach, the better we learn
The better we'll be
