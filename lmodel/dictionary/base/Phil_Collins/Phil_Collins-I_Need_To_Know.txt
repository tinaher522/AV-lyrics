TARZAN
Will someone tell me where I belong?
Where I should go?
Can someone tell me where I'm going wrong?
I need to know
Why would I hurt the ones I love?
Why would I hurt you?
If I can't be what he wants of me
What am I to do?
When will I be me
The son that he can't see?
There must be somebody who understands
Out there, somewhere
When will I find home?
A place where I belong?
Surely there must be more like me
Out there, somewhere
There must be somebody just like me
Out there...
