<song artist="Phil_Collins" title="Take_Me_In_Your_Arms_(Rock_Me_For_A_Little_While)">
Take me in your arm
Hold me a little while, hey baby
Well, I know you're leaving me behind
I'm seeing you, darling, for the very last time
Show a little tenderness before you go
Please let me feel your warm embrace once more
Take me in your arms
Rock me, rock me a little while
Take me in your arms
Rock me, rock me a little while
We all must feel heartache sometime
Right now, right now, I'm feeling mine
I'm trying my best to be strong but I'm not able
I'm like a helpless child wrapped in a cradle
Let me know joy before I grieve
Just once more, darling, before you leave
Take me in your arms
Rock me, rock me a little while
Take me in your arms
Rock me, rock me a little while
Oh, I'm losing you and my happiness
My life is over, I must confess
I'll never, never see your smiling face no more
I'll never, ever hear your knock-knock on my door
Before you leave, leave me behind
Let me feel happy just one more time
Take me in your arms
Rock me, rock me a little while
Take me in your arms
Rock me, rock me a little while
I begging you, baby
I beg you please
Here I am, baby
I'm down on my knees
Begging you, please
Begging you, please, please, please
Take me in your arms
Rock me, rock me a little while
Oh, come on, darling
Rock me, rock me a little while
Take me in your arms
Rock me, rock me a little while
Take me in your arms
Rock me, rock me a little while
