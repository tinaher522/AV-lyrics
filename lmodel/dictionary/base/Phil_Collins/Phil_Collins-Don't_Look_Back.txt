<song artist="Phil_Collins" title="Don't_Look_Back">
If it's love that you're running from, there's no hiding place.
(You can't run, you can't hide, you can't run, you can't hide)
Love has problems I know but they're problems, we'll just have to face.
Oh yeah, yeah.
If you just put your hand in mine,
We're gonna leave all our troubles behind.
Keep on walkin' don't look back. (Don't look back)
And don't look back. (Don't look back)
And don't look back, baby. (Don't look back)
(The past is behind you, let nothing remind you.)
If your first lover broke your heart,
There's something that can be done.
(You don't run, you don't hide, you don't run, you don't hide)
Don't end your faith in love because of what he's done.
So if you just put your hand in mine,
We're gonna leave all our troubles behind.
Keep on walking, don't look back. (don't look back)
Forget about the past now.
Don't look back, baby. (don't look back)
Keep on walking and don't look back. Hmm (don't look back)
(The past is behind you, let nothing remind you)
Love can be such a beautiful thing.
Though your first love let you down.
(You don't run, you don't hide, you don't run, you don't hide)
Oh yeah, yeah
'Cause I know we can make love bloom, baby.
The second time around.
Oh yeah
So if you just put your hand in mine,
We're gonna leave all our troubles behind.
Keep on pushing and don't look back. (Don't look back)
Don't look back, girl. (Don't look back)
Oh no we won't look back. (Don't look back)
Keep on walking and won't look back. (Don't look back)
Keep on walking and won't look back. (Don't look back)
