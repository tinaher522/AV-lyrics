<song artist="Phil_Collins" title="It's_Everywhere">
It can be in the way you're walking,
when you don't know where you're going too
it's in the way you make love to your lady friend
some people can sit still, and you can tell they got it
if you can't ask, you can smile while you pretend
oh, yeah, yeah, look around, it's everywhere
oh, yeah, yeah, you can find it, it's everywhere
It could be in the way you wear clothes when you going out at night
it could be in the way you tip your hat to a passer by
it could be in the way you hold someone's hand so tight
it could be the way you kiss a long long lost friend goodbye
oh, yeah, yeah, look around, it's everywhere
you almost touch it
oh, yeah, yeah, you can find it, it's everywhere
I just remember it's not how smooth you move
it's what you can't see
touching somebody's heart
just reach out, it's everywhere
reach out and touch
oh, yeah, yeah, it's everywhere, everywhere, everywhere, listen
It could be in the way you put your arm around someone to give them some comfort
it can be in the things you say to show you care
it can be in the way you talk to your loved one on the phone
it can be in the way you run your fingers thru her hair
oh, yeah, yeah, look around, it's everywhere
so strong you can almost touch it
oh, yeah, yeah, you can fint it, it's everywhere
Check it out people, you know it's everywhere
it's no mystery you can findit, if you're looking, you know it's everywhere
remember it's what you can't see, the touch of somebody's heart
just reach out, it's everywhere
yeah, yeah, it's everywhere
everywhere, everywhere, everywhere, everywhere,
it's everywhere, it's just a feeling, people you know
it's everywhere
reach out and touch
reach out and touch
it's everywhere
