My tribute
It's all for you, it's all for you
For what you have shown me
It's all for you, it's all for you
For what you have made me
It's all for you, it's all for you
For what you have shown me
It's all for you, it's all for you
For what you have made me
Here's my tribute
Fifteen, I had known to be
So confused, broken easily
Now I could not be off the memory without you next to me
Eighteen, you made me see
You lit the lights I've been dampening
Now I could not be off the memory without you next to me
My passion was abused, my words were never used
But now I hope that you can see
That it's all for you, it's all for you
For what you have shown me and what you do
It's all for you, it's all for you
For what you have made me, you're how I grew
Here's my tribute
Twenty-three, now I'm taken in
This vicious world I was captured in
Now I could not be off the memory without you next to me
My passion was abused, my words were never used
But now I hope that you can see
That it's all for you, it's all for you
For what you have shown me and what you do
It's all for you, it's all for you
For what you have made me, you're how I grew
It's all for you, it's all for you
For what you have shown me and what you do
It's all for you, it's all for you
For what you have made me, you're how I grew
It's my tribute
My tribute - oh no
This life I've been wanting, life I've been needing
It's my life, it's my tribute
This life I've been wanting, life I've been needing
It's my life, it's my tribute
It's all for you, it's all for you
For what you have shown me and what you do
It's all for you, it's all for you
For what you have made me, you're how I grew
It's all for you, it's all for you
For what you have shown me and what you do
It's all for you, it's all for you
For what you have made me, you're how I grew
That it's all for you, it's all for you
For what you have shown me and what you do
It's all for you, it's all for you
For what you have made me, you're how I grew
It's all for you, it's all for you
For what you have shown me and what you do
It's all for you, it's all for you
For what you have made me, you're how I grew
Here's my tribute
