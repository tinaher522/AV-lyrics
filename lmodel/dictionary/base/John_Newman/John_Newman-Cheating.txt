<song artist="John_Newman" title="Cheating">
I saw you Sunday, Monday
Hanging with your man again
You came a-back on the Tuesday
With that cold, hard look of shame
Oh, I could love you better
Better than you once knew
And if you're cheating, cheat on, yeah
'Cause cheating's just the thing you do
It's just the thing you do
I saw you Friday, Saturday
Tearing up another heart
You came home a-crying
Why'd you take it all so hard?
You know I love you better
Better than you once knew
And if you're cheating, cheat on, yeah
But I would never cheat on you
Yeah, I could love you better
Better than you once knew
And if you're cheating, cheat on, yeah
'Cause cheating's just the thing you do
It's just the thing you do
Oh, I've been tortured baby
Girl, you done something so bad to me
But I know
You are the one who's creeping
You are the one who's cheating
But if your heart is beating
Bring it on, bring it to me
You are the one who's creeping
You are the one who's cheating
But if your heart is beating
Bring it on, bring it to me
I could love you better
Better than you once knew
And if you're cheating, cheat on, yeah
But I would never cheat on you, no
I could love you better
Better than you once knew
And if you're cheating, cheat on, yeah
'Cause cheating's just the thing you do
