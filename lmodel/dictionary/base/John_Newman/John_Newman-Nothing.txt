<song artist="John_Newman" title="Nothing">
I came here tonight, ...
Give you one last chance before I move on
I can't stop remembering, it's only tearing me apart
I'm suffering, I'm struggling to get this all out of my heart
Well, there's nothing I can do for you
Nothing that's good enough
I never learn from my mistakes
It's all my fault, you're hard to blame
Nothing I can do for you
That's good enough
However hard you may cry
I won't hear you, you won't know why
You never hear my cries, you never stop the pain
You never ask yourself what they're for
I'm suffering, I'm struggling to get this all out of my heart
Well, there's nothing I can do for you
Nothing that's good enough
I never learn from my mistakes
It's all my fault, you're hard to blame
Nothing I can do for you
That's good enough
I've been tryin'a get you what you want
Give you everything you want
Now that's never gonna leave, it's never gonna leave now
Nothing I can do (I can do)
For you (For your)
Nothing that's good enough
I never learn from my mistakes
It's all my fault, you're hard to blame
Nothing I can't do for you (I can do)
For you that's good enough
Oh, there's nothing, no (Alright)
Oh, there's nothing, no (Alright)
I never learn from my mistakes
It's all my fault, you're hard to blame
