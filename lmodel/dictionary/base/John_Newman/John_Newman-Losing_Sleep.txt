<song artist="John_Newman" title="Losing_Sleep">
It's 3 AM, I'm calling in to tell you that without you here
I'm losing sleep
I'm losing sleep
Every sound around this lonely house is leaving me filled with fear
I'm losing sleep
I'm losing sleep
And I know what it's like
To be a child scared of the night
Please don't stop loving me, loving me - ooh-ooh ooh
Wanting me, wanting me like you do
Please don't stop caring now, caring now - ooh-ooh ooh
Caring now, caring now like you do
I know you have to work out there, it's for the best, but can't you see?
I'm losing sleep
I'm losing sleep
Remember telling you to go, you've always done what's good for me
I'm losing sleep
I'm losing sleep
And I know what it's like
To be a child scared, so scared of the night
Please don't stop loving me, loving me
Wanting me, wanting me like you do
Please don't stop caring now, caring now
Caring now, caring now like you do
Running from the dark but I just can't hide
Dreading sundown, yeah, I'm dreading the night
Need you back here 'cause it feels so wrong, yeah
Oh, please don't stop loving me, loving me
Whoa-no oh no-no, whoa-oh oh whoa-oh
Loving me, Loving me
Darling, no-oh, oh
Please don't stop caring now, caring now
Ooh-ooh ooh ooh, ooh-ooh ooh ooh
Caring now, caring now
No oh, oh, oh
Please don't stop loving me, loving me
Oh, no oh
Cannot be wrong (Wanting me, wanting me)
Like you do
It's 3 AM, I'm calling in to tell you that without you here
I'm losing sleep
I'm losing sleep
