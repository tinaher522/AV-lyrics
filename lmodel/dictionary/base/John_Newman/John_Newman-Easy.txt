<song artist="John_Newman" title="Easy">
Just another song
Just another tale
Of a broken heart
Don't wanna see you hurt
There's something you should learn
From the stars
My friend you ought to know
I'm afraid it's time to know
Whoever said love was easy?
Do you know they told you wrong?
'Cause every time you feel it, yeah
A piece of you is gone
Is it something that you want?
Something that you need?
'Cause some day you should know
Whoever said love was easy?
Do you know they told you wrong?
Write it on the wall
Tell it to them all
Are you happy now?
Now you're standing tall
Don't wanna see you fall
Down to the ground
My friend, you ought to know
I'm afraid it's time to know
Whoever said love was easy?
Do you know they told you wrong?
'Cause every time you feel it yeah
A piece of you is gone
Is it something that you want?
Something that you need?
'Cause some day you should know
Whoever said love was easy?
Do you know they told you wrong?
I know the feeling is sweeter than ever
But I won't regret
I'd rather tell you, now or never
What to expect
Tears don't always dry
The tunnel has no light
At the end
Whoever said love was easy?
Do you know they told you wrong?
'Cause every time you feel it yeah
A piece of you is gone
Something that you want, you need?
'Cause some day you should know
Whoever said love was easy?
Do you know they told you wrong?
Oh no, they told you wrong
