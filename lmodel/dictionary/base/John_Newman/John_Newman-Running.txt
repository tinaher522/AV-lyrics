<song artist="John_Newman" title="Running">
One hundred days, two thousand miles
To you I'd run through day and night
We've got to finish what we started
We've got a lot to rescue darling
My shirt is torn, these shoes are worn
My blood's been drawn but still I'm strong
I feel like I'm a force of nature
I guess that makes you my creator
Tryin'a stop a river when it wants to rise
Tryin'a stop a blaze of a burning fire
I'm a hurricane that ain't stopping, no no-no, oh
And I keep, keep running
And I keep, keep running
And I keep, keep coming back for more, oh-oh
Keep running
And I keep, keep running
And I keep, keep coming back for more, no
I've got to tell you now - I've crossed the world
I've crossed through time
And giving up never crossed my mind
I feel like I'm a force of nature
I guess that makes you my creator
Tryin'a stop a river when it wants to rise
Tryin'a stop a blaze of a burning fire
I'm a hurricane that ain't stopping, no no-no, oh
And I keep, keep running
And I keep, keep running
And I keep, keep coming back for more, oh-oh
Keep running
And I keep, keep running
And I keep, keep coming back for more, no-no, oh
Baby, I keep
Tryin'a stop a river when it wants to rise
Tryin'a stop a blaze of a burning fire
I'm a hurricane that ain't stopping, no no-no, oh, oh
And I keep, keep running
And I keep, keep running
And I keep, keep coming
No-no, oh
Keep running
And I keep, keep running (And I keep)
And I keep, keep coming
And I keep, keep running
And I keep, keep running
And I keep, keep coming
Back for more, oh no, I keep
Keep running
And I keep, keep running
And I keep, keep coming back for more
No, oh-oh, oh-oh
