<song artist="John_Newman" title="Gold_Dust">
Here and now, it's my time to talk
I'm throwing out these two years of thoughts
Freeze and take a deep breath
I'll lay my heart out helpless on the floor
Tears crash down your face, not mine
Screaming out how I changed through time
Know it's hard to leave it
To say we've been defeated
But everything around me has changed
My-my
We have
Gold dust
Gold dust
Gold dust
No more
Tear drops
Tear drops
Tear drops
Memories without fortune or fame
Endlessly through the night and through the day
Would make our time seem easy
Dark days seem so pleasing
But everything around me has changed
My-my
We have
Gold dust
Gold dust
Gold dust
No more
Tear drops
Tear drops
Tear drops
Well, I'm so sorry, darling
Did I break your trust completely?
I don't want you to be lonely
'Cause I know you'll find the love again
And I promise I'll stop calling
If it makes this easy for you
And I hate to see you leaving
But it's for the best, believe me
We have
Gold dust
Gold dust
Gold dust
No more
Tear drops
Tear drops
Tear drops
Gold dust
Gold dust
Gold dust
No more
Tear drops
Tear drops
Tear drops
