<song artist="John_Newman" title="Down_The_Line">
I've been battered, I've been bruised
And though I know it's no excuse
For you I know I'm right
But in another place, in another time
I'd buy you flowers, I'd build a home
Right now, can't pay the bills, I cannot go
Can't give you anything you need
But maybe if you meet me further down the line
'Cause you're the right person at the wrong time
I wanna run into the light
Leave the dark behind
I wanna break the chains of life
With you right by my side
So you gotta meet me down the line
So you gotta meet me down the line
I'm easily dazed, I'm so confused
It's hurting me and I'm hurting you
Despite everything you do
You're gonna have to meet me further down the line
'Cause you're the right person at the wrong time
I wanna run into the light
Leave the dark behind
I wanna break the chains of life
With you right by my side
So
You gotta meet me down the line
So
You gotta meet me down the line
You've been trying hard to make me feel a little better
It's gonna take a while to make me feel a little better
And I'll try, try, try, try, a little harder - ooh, yeah
And I swear, swear, swear, I'll get a little further
I wanna run into the light
Leave the dark behind
I wanna break the chains of life
With you right by my side
So
You gotta meet me down the line
So
You gotta meet me down the line
So you gotta meet me down the line
I'm easily dazed, I'm so confused
It's hurting me and I'm hurting you
