You know I said it's true
I can feel the love
Can you feel it too
I can feel it ah-ah
I can feel it ah-ah
You know I said it's true
I can feel the love
Can you feel it too
I can feel it ah-ah
I can feel it ah-ah
You know I said it's true
You know I said
You know I said it's true
You know I said
You know I said it's true
I can feel the love
Can you feel it too
I can feel it ah-ah
I can feel it ah-ah
You know I said it's true
I can feel the love
Can you feel it too
I can feel it ah-ah
I can feel it ah-ah
You know, You know, You know
I gotta tell you
I gotta tell you (tell you)
I gotta tell you (tell you)
I gotta tell you (tell you)
Tell you (tell you)
(You know I said it's true), so true
(You know I can feel it too)
I can feel it now, I can feel it now
(You know I said it's true), so true
(You know I can feel it too)
I can feel it now, I can feel it now
You know I said it's true
I can feel the love
Can you feel it too
I can feel it ah-ah
I can feel it ah-ah
You know I said it's true
I can feel the love
Can you feel it too
I can feel it ah-ah
I can feel it ah-ah
You know I said it's true
I can feel the love
Can you feel it too
I can feel it ah-ah
I can feel it ah-ah
I can feel it
I can feel it
I can feel it
Can you feel it too
