<song artist="John_Newman" title="Try">
Working so hard, I was so alone
So much on my cards, too much going on
And lately I've found I'm heading astray
And none of your feelings came into play
I make us stronger (Stronger)
Stronger
'Cause now I can see those fakes that use me
I'll make us stronger (Stronger)
Stronger
'Cause I know it's you saving me
I will try, try, try not to bring it all home
I will fight, fight, fight for what we had before
You don't even want this, you don't even need this
You don't have to cover up your tears at all
I will try, try, try not to bring it all home
Try na na na
Ten days apart when three seems insane
You can't hear my voice, you still hear my name
A call from a afar, a message to say
I pray you don't leave me, nothing's changed
I'll make us stronger (Stronger)
Stronger
'Cause now I can see those fakes that use me
I'll make us stronger (Stronger)
Stronger
'Cause I know it's you saving me
I will try, try, try not to bring it all home
I will fight, fight, fight for what we had before
You don't even want this, you don't even need this
You don't have to cover up your tears at all
I will try, try, try not to bring it all home
Oh oh oh oh
Oh, I'm so sorry, darling
I've been breaking this home for far too long
So I, I
I will try
I will fight
You don't even want this, you don't even need this
You don't have to cover up your tears at all
I will try, try, try not to bring it all home
Try na na na
