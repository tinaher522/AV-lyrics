Fire
Time to burn the flame all through the night
Time to bring my dark shame into light
Oh yeah, I'm fighting, fighting, fighting to be free
Stronger
Stronger than the man I used to be
Time to ring the golden age for me
Oh yeah, I'm fighting, fighting, fighting to be free
And all the chances I take
All the changes I make
Yeah, they all mean nothing
'Cause all I need is you
(All I need is you, all I need is you)
All I need is you
(All I need is you, all I need)
Tried to cover up with all these thrills
And really all I need is you
(All I need is you, all I need)
I'm
The rising force that you will never tame
The growing cause that you will not contain
Oh yeah, I'm fighting, fighting, fighting to be free
And all the chances I take
All the changes I make
Yeah, they all mean nothing
'Cause all I need is you
(All I need is you, all I need is you)
All I need is you
(All I need is you, all I need)
Tried to cover up with all these thrills
And really all I need is you
(All I need is you, all I need)
And really all I need is you
Calling out, calling out, calling out for you
Calling out, calling out, calling out for you
'Cause all I need is you
(All I need is you, all I need is you)
All I need is you
(All I need is you, all I need)
Tried to cover up with all these thrills
And really all I need is you
(All I need is you, all I need)
All I need is you, all I need is you
(All I need is you, all I need)
I need, I need is you
(All I need is you, all I need)
All I need is you
(All I need is you, all I need)
It's all I need
(All I need is you, all I need)
Is you
