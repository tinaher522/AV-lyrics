<song artist="John_Newman" title="Day_One">
Day one, it felt so high
You were selfish from the start
You couldn't open up your heart
You were ripping love apart
Day two, I felt the pain
Couldn't play your foolish game
Every step was dead wrong
Still I stand by what I said
Won't take this anymore
Won't take your lies
Won't take your hand
I'm breaking out the door
I've been broken since day one
You, your vicious like them all
In what you say, in what you do
No more I take this shit from you
I've been broken since day one
Day three, you cut me cold
Left me wailing on my own
You got such a selfish soul
You don't deserve all I've shown
You ain't never gonna change
You'll always be so fake
And everything is just wrong
Still I stand by what I said
Won't take this anymore
Won't take your lies
Won't take your hand
I'm breaking out the door
I've been broken since day one
You, your vicious like them all
In what you say in what you do
No more I take this shit from you
I've been broken since day one
(You're never gonna change and that's what's gonna be that)
You ain't changing for nobody
(I'm never gonna change and that's what's gonna be that)
No, no, no, no, baby, no
(I'm never gonna change and that's what's gonna be that)
I ain't changing for nobody no, no, no
(I'm never gonna change and that's what's gonna be that)
I've been broken since day one
You, your vicious like them all
In what you say in what you do
No more I take this shit from you
I've been broken since day one
I've been broken since day one
You, your vicious like them all
In what you say in what you do
No more I take this shit from you
I've been broken since day one
