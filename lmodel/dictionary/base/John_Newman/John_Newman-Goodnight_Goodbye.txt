<song artist="John_Newman" title="Goodnight_Goodbye">
As soon as the door slammed
The silence that fell
Was all that you left me
With a story to tell
'Bout cigarettes and ashtrays
That I smoked with you
I tried to find the truth
Lying there with you
I never listened, I never listened
All the things you said
I'll never hear again
I should've listened more
You said goodnight
Know you really meant goodbye
We just watched it burn
Know we could've kept love alive
I'd still be loving you
I'd still be loving you
Your make-up on my sheets
Your clothes on the floor
The photos that I'll keep
How we were before
Before I took you for granted
Before the memories were torn
I tried to find the truth
Lying there with you
I never listened, I never listened
All the things you said
I'll never hear again
I should've listened more
You said goodnight
Know you really meant goodbye
We just watched it burn
Know we could've kept love alive
I'd still be loving you
I'd still be loving you
It's time to confess of being at my best
But this time I won't get it wrong
It's time to confess of being at my best
But this time I won't lead you on
You said goodnight
Know you really meant goodbye (I know you meant goodbye)
We just watched it burn
Know we could've kept love alive  (We watch it burn, oh)
I'd still be loving you
I'd still be loving you
