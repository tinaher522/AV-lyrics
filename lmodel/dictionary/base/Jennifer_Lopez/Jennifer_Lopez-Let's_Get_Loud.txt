<song artist="Jennifer_Lopez" title="Let's_Get_Loud">
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Let's get loud, let's get loud
Turn the music up, let's do it
C'mon people let's get loud
Let's get loud
Turn the music up to hear that sound
Let's get loud, let's get loud
Ain't nobody gotta tell ya
What you gotta do
If you wanna live your life
Live it all the way and don't you waste it
Every feelin' every beat
Can be so very sweet you gotta taste it
You gotta do it (you gotta do it) 
you gotta do it your way
You gotta prove it (you gotta prove it) 
You gotta mean what you say
You gotta do it (do it)
you gotta do it your way
You gotta prove it (prove it)
You gotta mean what you say
Life's a party, make it hot
Dance don't ever stop, whatever rhythm
Every minute, every day
Take them all the way you gotta live 'em ('cause I'm going to live my life)
You gotta do it (you gotta do it) 
you gotta do it your way
You gotta prove it (you gotta prove it) 
You gotta mean what you say
You gotta do it (do it)
you gotta do it your way
You gotta prove it (prove it)
You gotta mean what you say
Let's get loud, let's get loud
Turn the music up to hear that sound
Let's get loud, let's get loud
Ain't nobody gotta tell you
What you gotta do, oh no
(Make it hot)
Let's get loud, let's get loud
Let's get loud, lets'get loud
It's just a party, baby
Let's get loud, let's get loud
Let's get loud, pop it up
(Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!)
Life is meant to be big fun
You're not hurtin' anyone
Nobody loses
let the music make you free
be what you wanna be make no excuses
You gotta do it, (do)
you gotta do it your way (what you wanna do)
To gotta prove it (say)
You gotta mean what you say (what you wanna say)
You gotta do it, (go) 
you gotta do it your way (where you wanna go)
You gotta prove it
You gotta mean what you say (just do it, ohh)
Let's get loud, let's get loud
Turn the music up to hear that sound
Let's get loud, let's get loud
Ain't nobody gotta tell you
What you gotta do 
Let's get loud, let's get loud
Let's get loud, let's get loud
Let's get loud, let's get loud
Turn the music up to hear that sound
Let's get loud, let's get loud
Ain't nobody gotta tell you
What you gotta do 
You didn't know I could do that did ya
