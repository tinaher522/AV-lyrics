<song artist="Jennifer_Lopez" title="It_Was_You">
Remember when I was young
And dreaming of falling in love,
Thinking who would be the one, to take my breath away
Always wanted something real
A bond no one can break
Praying that I would feel the way I do today
Finally you came in my life and I can't deny
It was you, the one in my dreams
A blessing to me, something for me to live for
Cause of you, I can finally hear the song of myself
The sweet melody and I knew it was you
Just wanted to let you know
That you give me all that I need
Hoping that we can grow, grow together
Cause what we have become, I'll never throw it away
Two lives made into one, doesn't get any better
Finally you came in my life and I can't deny
It was you, the one in my dreams
A blessing to me, something for me to live for
Cause of you, I can finally hear the song of myself
I know I'm coming on real strong
But I believe that we belong together
Can you love me forever?
Cause you got me feeling you
I know that we got our way to grow
But I have never felt like this before
Every touch and kiss you got me feeling
Feeling this. . .
It was you, the one in my dreams
A blessing to me, something for me to live for
Cause of you, I can finally hear the song of myself
The sweet melody and I knew it was you
The one in my dreams
A blessing to me, something for me to live for
Cause of you, I can finally hear the song of myself
The sweet melody and I knew it was you
