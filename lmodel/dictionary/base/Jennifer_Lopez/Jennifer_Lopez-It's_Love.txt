<song artist="Jennifer_Lopez" title="It's_Love">
What a strange sensation
Your magic captured me
With you I lost all my faith and control
It was your willingness, your weakness
and my obsession with you
you can leave after one more kiss
I lost reason
It's love, that's what I know
The craziness and the desire
It's love that you gave me
This intense fire
I got used to you
In dreams I felt you

Fly for my body making love
I want to get lost inside you
Burning in heat
It always quinched your thirst
Drinking my love up
It's love, that's what I know
the craziness and the desire
It's love that you gave me
This intense fire
It's love, that's what I know
It's consuming me
It's love that you gave me
What a naked feeling
