Jennifer... J. Lo..
Oh no...Oh no..I know...
I mean I love you baby
Now somehow you feel left out
Somehow you're feeling down
Got an inch but took a mile
Oh nooooooooo
Right now your body's in need
Can't replace what you had in me
My words are cuttin' deep
Oh nooooooooo
Watch me fall now 
I'm colder than winter
My love you forgot,
Let me help you remember
I loved you like you never been
So overdosed on your own medicine
There's no need to call me on the phone
Telling me how much you're alone
Enemy of my state of mind
Now I'm the villain, I'm the villain
I told you that you would need my love
I give you my all but that wasn't enough
Enemy of my state of mind
Now I'm the villain, I'm the villain of your love
Lalalalalalalalala 
Lalalalalalalalala 
Lalalalalalalalala 
Baby, I'm the villain
Baby, I'm the villain of your love
Oh now you get the picture
Oh-oh now you wanna fix her
Oh-oh now you're screaming let's go back
I ain't having that
But now my love ain't around
It's behind walls that won't come down
But now you wanna show up and turn my sour sweet
You gon' miss me
Watch me fall now 
I'm colder than winter
My love you forgot,
Let me help you remember
I loved you like you never been
So overdosed on your own medicine
There's no need to call me on the phone
Telling me how much you're alone
Enemy of my state of mind
Now I'm the villain, I'm the villain
I told you that you would need my love
I give you my all but that wasn't enough
Enemy of my state of mind
Now I'm the villain, I'm the villain of your love
There's no need to call me on the phone
Telling me how much you're alone
Enemy of my state of mind
Now I'm the villain, I'm the villain
I told you that you would need my love
I give you my all but that wasn't enough
Enemy of my state of mind
Now I'm the villain, I'm the villain of your love
Lalalalalalalalala 
Lalalalalalalalala 
Lalalalalalalalala 
Baby, I'm the villain
Baby, I'm the villain...
