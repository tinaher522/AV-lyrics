<song artist="Jennifer_Lopez" title="Everybody's_Girl">
Let's play a game
Let's just pretend like you don't know who I am
Believe it if you say that you're not a fan
Act like I'm interested in some other man, man, man
Turn on the lights so that the camera flashing won't be so bright
And like the crowd ain't getting big outside 
They're wanting details on how I live my life, my life, my life
There's no escape from the fame, to somewhere they don't know my name
I love you, I do feel your pain but the question still remains
Can you love somebody loved by everybody, can you love somebody when they're everybody's girl?
Can you love somebody loved by everybody, can you love somebody when they're everybody's girl?
Can you love her, can you love her, can you love the girl?
Can you love her, can you love her, can you love the girl?
Can you love her, can you love her, can you love the girl?
Can you love her, can you love her, can you love the girl?
Out through the back too many people blocking the front door we go our different ways
Though we want more, another gig I got don't end 'til four, four, four
There's no escape from the fame, to somewhere they don't know my name
I love you, I do feel your pain but the question still remains
Can you love somebody loved by everybody, can you love somebody when they're everybody's girl?
Can you love somebody loved by everybody, can you love somebody when they're everybody's girl?
Can you love her, can you love her, can you love the girl?
Can you love her, can you love her, can you love the girl?
Can you love her, can you love her, can you love the girl?
Can you love her, can you love her, can you love the girl?
Can you hang on to a shooting star, and the distance near and far
Don't let the jealousy and envy get to you
'Cause I'll be running home right back to you
Can you love somebody loved by everybody, can you love somebody when they're everybody's girl?
Can you love somebody loved by everybody, can you love somebody when they're everybody's girl?
Can you love her, can you love her, can you love the girl?
Can you love her, can you love her, can you love the girl?
Can you love her, can you love her, can you love the girl?
Can you love her, can you love her, can you love the girl?
