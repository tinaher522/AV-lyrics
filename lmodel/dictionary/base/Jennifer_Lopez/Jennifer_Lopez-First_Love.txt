<song artist="Jennifer_Lopez" title="First_Love">
See I know a little bit something good
Always comes out of a little bit something bad
And I wasn't looking for someone new
Till you came down
Giving me the best that I've had
And now you're on my skin
Body to body
Working me out
Yeah you, you play to win
Rocking me steady
Round after round
Oh oh oh oh
I wish you were my first love
'Cause if you were first
Baby there would have been no second, third, or fourth love
Whoa oh oh oh
I wish you were my first love
'Cause if you were first
Baby there would have been no second, third, or fourth love
Whoa oh oh oh I
Mistakes I don't worry 'bout them no more
It ain't no thing
'Cause you got me up on Cloud 9
So good, knowing I could just keep it real
T-shirt and jeans
See you making me feel so fly
And now you're on my skin
Body to body
Working me out
Yeah you, you play to win
Rocking me steady
Round after round
Oh oh oh oh
I wish you were my first love
'Cause if you were first
Baby there would have been no second, third, or fourth love
Whoa oh oh oh
I wish you were my first love
'Cause if you were first
Baby there would have been no second, third, or fourth love
Whoa oh oh oh I
You make me wanna ride again
'Cause I, I wanna hear you say my name
'Cause I
You make me wanna ride again
'Cause I, I I I I
You make me wanna ride again
'Cause I, I wanna hear you say my name
'Cause I
You make me wanna ride again
'Cause I, I I I I
Whoa, oh oh oh oh
I wish you were my first love
'Cause if you were first
Baby there would have been no second, third, or fourth love
Oh oh oh oh
I wish you were my first love
'Cause if you were first
Baby there would have been no second, third, or fourth love
Oh oh oh oh
I wish you were my first love
'Cause if you were first
Baby there would have been no second, third, or fourth love
Whoa oh oh oh
I wish you were my first love
'Cause if you were first
Baby there would have been no second, third, or fourth love
Oh oh oh oh I
