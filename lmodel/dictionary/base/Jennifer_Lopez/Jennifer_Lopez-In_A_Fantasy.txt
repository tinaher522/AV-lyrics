<song artist="Jennifer_Lopez" title="In_A_Fantasy">
I Just can't control myself I cant be with no one else
It seems I'm addicted to the way u like to touch me.
I don't think they understand why I love at your command
From the words you speak so deep my body's weak I have to have you.
I love you 
Your perfect 
A manifestation of a dream
You make my body feel about A million diffrent things.
I think god made you for me a mix of 
Passion and fidelity baby your so complete
I write this song to let you know that you 
Will always be to me my lust, my love, my man, my child, 
My friend, and my king.
I love you
Your perfect a
Manifestaion of a dream
You make my body feel about a million different things
There's no way I'd leave you,
Just not a reality
Sometimes I feel Like I'm 
Living In a fantasy
