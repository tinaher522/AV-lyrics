<song artist="Jennifer_Lopez" title="Should've_Never">
I've been so
Caught up in the thought of me and you
Even though I love
Someone else, I know my heart belongs to you
Tell me, how did we
Ever let the situation get this far
Maybe we should just
Try to hide the things we feel inside
Things I know we can't deny
Should've never told you
That I cared about you
Didn't think that it would be so bad
Should've never kissed you
Should've never held your hand
Got to find a way to let these feelings go
What did I
Do the day I let you slip into my soul
It was then, when I
Realized that I would always want you in my life
No one else can know
Of the things that we've been saying on the telephone
It would be so bad
If they ever knew that me and you
Were secretly into each other
Should've never told you
That I cared about you
Didn't think that it would be so bad
Should've never kissed you
Should've never held your hand
Got to find a way to let these feelings go
I'm so scared, trembling inside
'Cause I'm feeling like somebody else already knows
Oh my God, I love you both so much
But to have to choose between the two
Is hurting me so deep inside
Should've never told you
That I cared about you
Didn't think that it would be so bad
Should've never kissed you
Should've never held your hand
I don't ever wanna feel this way again
Should've never told you
That I cared about you
Should've never kissed you
Should've never held your hand
Should've never told you
That I cared about you
Should've never kissed you
Should've never held your hand
Should've never told you
That I cared about you
Should've never kissed you
Should've never held your hand
Should've never told you
That I cared about you
Should've never kissed you
Should've never held your hand
Should've never told you
That I cared about you
Should've never kissed you
Should've never held your hand
Should've never told you
That I cared about you
Should've never kissed you
Should've never held your hand
Mi amor --
A veces tengo miedo que voy a tener que vivir esta vida sin ti
Que el mundo no nos va a dejar estar juntos
Que nunca mas voy a sentir tus manos sobre mi piel
Amor mio, ¿qué voy a hacer sin ti?
¿Qué voy a hacer sin ti?
¿Qué voy a hacer?
Este amor que es tan cruel y tan dulce a la misma vez
Tocame, una vez mas
Ay asi, asi
Besame, besame como si fuera la ultima vez
Porque si puede ser
Devorame, devorame
Te quiero --
¿Y nunca lo arrepentire...
(My love
Sometimes I'm afraid that I'm going to have to live this life without you
That the world won't let us be together
That I'll never again feel your hands against my skin
My love, what am I going to do without you?
What am I going to do without you?
What am I going to do?
This love is so cruel and so sweet at the same time
Touch me, one more time
Ay, so, so
Kiss me, kiss me like it was the last time
Because it could be
Devour me, devour me
I love you
And I'll never regret it)
