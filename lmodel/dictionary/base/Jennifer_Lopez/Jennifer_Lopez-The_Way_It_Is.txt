<song artist="Jennifer_Lopez" title="The_Way_It_Is">
It always feels like I'm in love to me
In the beginning
My mind is just a mirror
Of the way my heart wants it to be
I hope to see everything in his eyes
Because that's where it starts with the truth and the lies
And I can not hide my emotions
You can not hide your intentions from me
Don't you think
What I'm saying is
That's just the way it is
That's just the way it is
Not everything
Is what you say it is
That's just the way it is
The way it is
The way it is
And everything you do to me I put onto you
And everything I put you through and I'll go through
But I'm willing to take that chance
But this type of romance
Is special baby
I always look for love to be
So exciting
But you can't force it
I'm gonna find it
In reality chemistry is everything
Don't you think
What I'm saying is
That's just the way it is
That's just the way it is
Not everything
Is what you say it is
That's just the way it is
The way it is
The way it is
Don't you think
What I'm saying is
That's just the way it is
That's just the way it is
Not everything
Is what you say it is
That's just the way it is
The way it is
The way it is
Yeah, yeah
What your perception is
Of our connection is
Simply reflectioning is the same thing
If you're accepting it
Then I'm accepting it
So quit perfectioning
It's just the same thing
Don't you think
What I'm saying is
That's just the way it is
That's just the way it is
Not everything
Is what you say it is
That's just the way it is
The way it is
The way it is
Don't you think
What I'm saying is
That's just the way it is
That's just the way it is
Not everything
Is what you say it is
That's just the way it is
The way it is
The way it is
Don't you think
What I'm saying is
That's just the way it is
That's just the way it is
Not everything
Is what you say it is
That's just the way it is
The way it is
The way it is
