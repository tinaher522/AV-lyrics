<song artist="Jennifer_Lopez" title="Do_It_Well_(Remix)">
Do it, do it
You do it, do it
You're doin' it well
Here's the thing
I was mindin' my business doin' what I do
I wasn't trynna look for anything
Alla sudden, couldn't take my eyes off you
I didn't even know if you could tell
That you had me in a daze
Sayin', "What the hell?"
Here's my name, number
Baby, just hit my cell
Lovin' everything you do
'Cos you do it well
Don't know what you got me thinkin'
You ain't even trynna play me, boy
'Cos you're so good and you're so fine
Got me sayin' crazy things, listen
I ain't never met a man like that
I ain't never fell so far, so fast
You can turn me on, throw me off track
Boy, you do it, do it
You do it, do it
You're doin' it well
I ain't never met a man like that
I ain't never fell so far, so fast
You can turn me on, throw me off track
Boy, you do it, do it
You do it, do it
You're doin' it well
Lemme tell you how it's gonna go
You and me gonna need a little privacy
I don't wanna do the dance, no do-si-do
Need a one-woman man seven days a week
Quit trynna play it cool, boy, and
Make your move
I told you how it is
Nothin' to lose
You been starin' over here all night for free
And I ain't takin' cash or credit, just a guarantee
There ain't nobody else but me, boy
You ain't even trynna play me, boy
'Cos you're so good and you're so fine
Got me sayin' crazy things, listen
I ain't never met a man like that
I ain't never fell so far, so fast
You can turn me on, throw me off track
Boy, you do it, do it
You do it, do it
You're doin' it well
I ain't never met a man like that
I ain't never fell so far, so fast
You can turn me on, throw me off track
Boy, you do it, do it
You do it, do it
You're doin' it well (Luda!)
Ludacris
Can't nobody do it quite like me (nope!)
Hit it just right through the night like me (yep!)
Have 'em outta sight and invite like three
To hit the night life, they say, "Ay papi!"
Ay mami! It's nice to meet ya
Me gusta hermosas señoritas
I love how you shake your distinctive features
My name's Ludacris and I'd like to freak ya
They say, "No parar, do it again"
And you know me so I'm like, "Muy bien"
I'm the número uno rico hombre
Baby, feel this and grita mi nombre
Todo la noche
No, you won't say, "Skip the fo'play"
Sip some Rosé
Either that or some Veuve Clicquot
And on that note, adiós amigos
Baby, no need for false pretenses
Think you just shocked me to my senses
Everything that you do feels right
Do it, do it
Do it, do it all night
I know
You're thinking
Been thinkin' it too, babe
I ain't never met a man like that
I ain't never fell so far, so fast
You can turn me on, throw me off track
'Cos you do it, do it
You do it, do it
You're doin' it well
I ain't never met a man like that
I ain't never fell so far, so fast
You can turn me on, throw me off track
Boy, you do it, do it
You do it, do it
You're doin' it well
I ain't never met a man like that
I ain't never fell so far, so fast
You can turn me on, throw me off track
Boy, you do it, do it
You do it, do it
You're doin' it well
I ain't never met a man like that
I ain't never fell so far, so fast
You can turn me on, throw me off track
Boy, you do it, do it
You do it, do it
You're doin' it well
