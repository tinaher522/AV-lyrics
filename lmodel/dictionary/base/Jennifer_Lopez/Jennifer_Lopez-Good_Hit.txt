<song artist="Jennifer_Lopez" title="Good_Hit">
Uno, dos, tres, cuatro 
Good hit, I got that good hit 
I got that good hit, I got that good hit 
La la la la 
La la la la 
La la la la 
La la la la 
Can I please have your attention?! 
I'm so dope from head to toe 
Armed and big, I drop it low 
On the ground, I put it down 
Round and round yeah here we go 
Push up on me, I'm on the floor 
Talk up on it, make me yours 
Give you my love, give me love back 
Baby I'm here, where you at 
Got that New York swagger, Miami bass 
Got my California Loub's on, all up in your face 
Yeah I'm mid-west pimp tight, Texas fire 
Don't you want me to have your babies 
Don't you wish I was your Boo 
I got that good hit (La la la la) 
Don't you wish I was your boo 
I got that good hit (La la la la) 
Don't you wish I was your boo 
I got that good hit
