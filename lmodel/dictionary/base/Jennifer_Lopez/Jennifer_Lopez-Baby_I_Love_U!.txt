Boy I never knew I could feel
The way I felt, when I felt the way
You were feeling me baby
I'm so out of control, Yeah
Every time you look my way
I realize more and more
How much I adore those pretty eyes
Of yours, I'm helpless baby
What I wanna know is
Are you willing to try?
Can you love me for a lifetime
In just one night?
Baby I love you (love you)
Baby I need you (need you)
I gotta have you (I gotta have you babe)
Can't be without you (be without you)
Baby I love you (love you)
Baby I need you (need you)
I gotta have you (I gotta have you babe)
Can't be without you (be without you)
Blessed and cursed on the same day,
The day that I first felt the power of you
Inside of me, such a strong feeling,
There comes a time in everyone's life
When you know, and everyone around you knows
That everything is changed,
You're not the same,
It's a new day
Oh what I wanna know is,
Are you willing to try
There's gotta be more meaning to this
Than what meets the eye
Baby I love you (baby I need you)...(Yeah yeah!)
Baby I need you (gotta have you baby)...(I gotta have you!)
I gotta have you (can't be without you)...(Yeah yeah yeah!)
Can't be without you (baby I love you)
Baby I love you (love you)
Baby I need you (need you)
I gotta have you (I gotta have you babe)
Can't be without you (be without you)
Oh, I love the way you kiss me
Oh, baby please
I'm about to lose my mind
Oh talk to me, 'cause I'm begging for you
And I'm down on my knees
Baby, I know you're the one that I need
Baby I love you
You know I need you
I gotta have you
Can't be without you
Baby I love you (love you)
Baby I need you (need you)
I gotta have you (I gotta have you babe)
Can't be without you (be without you)
