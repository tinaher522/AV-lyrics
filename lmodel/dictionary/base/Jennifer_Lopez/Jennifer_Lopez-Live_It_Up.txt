<song artist="Jennifer_Lopez" title="Live_It_Up">
Pitbull:
From the streets of Miami to presenting at the Grammys
Con el muslito de Jennifer, maybe now you understand me
(Clap your hands, go clap your hands)
Mr. Worldwide
(Clap your hands to the beat)
RedOne
(Go clap your hands)
And the beautiful Jennifer Lopez
(Go clap your hands to the beat)
Dale!
We don't believe in defeat, that's why we're back from three feet
Hi Jenny, mira que esta loco, yo me lo como como pastelito coco
I get stupid on a beach, she woo-woo
I got mami, mamis by the boatload
Yo tengo la carne y ella el mojo
I'm saying dale, she's screaming YOLO
She's Little Red Riding Hood, and guess who's the lobo, me la como
Who's name is globally known?
Who's name's on a check and they adding an O?
Who's name is on the blimp with "The world is yours"?
Who's name is on schools, huh, slam for sure
I know it's hard to understand how a boy grew to a man
Man turned to a brand but guess what here I am
Jenny from the block, let's rock
Jennifer Lopez:
You push me harder, I do the same
Boy wanna feel ya, in every way
Don't even wonder, it's just a game
We rocking body to body, let's go insane
I hit the spotlight, all night, ready to go
Give you a hard night, so tight, ready to blow
I'm in the spotlight, all night, ready to go
Give you a hard night, so tight, ready to blow
Ohhh, we can do anything we want
Live it up, so live it up, live it up, go, ohh
And we ain't stopping till we done, live it up
So live it up, live it up, go go go go go go
(Make love, don't fight, let's fuck tonight)
(Let's fuck tonight)
Turn up this mutha and let it play
I know you like my bumper
Don't be ashamed
Don't even wonder, it's just a game
We rocking body to body, let's go insane
I hit the spotlight, all night, ready to go
Give you a hard night, so tight, ready to blow
I'm in the spotlight, all night, ready to go
Give you a hard night, so tight, ready to blow
Ohhh, we can do anything we want
Live it up, so live it up, live it up, go, ohhh
And we ain't stopping till we done, live it up
So live it up, live it up, go go go go go go
(Make love, don't fight, let's fuck tonight)
(Let's fuck tonight)
Pitbull:
You name it, she's done it
She's the reason that women run it
Bet this on a Grammy
Maybe now you understand me
(Clap your hands, go clap your hands, go clap your hands, to the beat)
(Clap your hands, go clap your hands, go clap your hands, to the beat)
(Clap your hands, go clap your hands, go clap your hands, to the beat)
Jennifer Lopez:
Ohhh, we can do anything we want
Live it up, so live it up, live it up, go, ohhh
And we ain't stopping till we done, live it up
So live it up, live it up, go go go go go go
(Let's hook tonight)
(Let's hook tonight)
