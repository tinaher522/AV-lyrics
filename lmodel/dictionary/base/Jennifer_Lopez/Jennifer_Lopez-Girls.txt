[Intro]
All the girls all go, getting money on your own, let me see ya get low on the floor
[Verse 1]
Got on my dress, I plan on going in tonight
I’ma give you my best, I was waiting on you
Because when I drop drop drop it down, everybody going to see
How you like like like it now, all eyes on me
Because the way this thing rolling and the smoke that you’re smoking feels good
[Hook]
At the end of the night, girls just wanna have fun
Swinging in the air, show them show them what you working with
At the end of the night, girls just wanna have fun
Because we don’t really care, we don’t really care girls just wanna have fun
[Verse 2]
Now see I got your attention, I’m a play up on it
In the club and I’m choosing, you’re gonna be that one tonight
Because when I drop drop drop it down, everybody going to see
How you like like like it now, all eyes on me
Because the way this thing rolling and the smoke that you’re smoking feels good
[Hook]
[Bridge]
All the girls all go, getting money on your own, let me see ya get low on the floor
Because you got a one night pass, need more in my glass, pour me up baby this your song
And it if you do it up real big ain’t worried bout a, turn it up with me all night long
Give it to em, give it to em
[Hook]
