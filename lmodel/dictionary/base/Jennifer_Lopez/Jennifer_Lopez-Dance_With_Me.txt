<song artist="Jennifer_Lopez" title="Dance_With_Me">
Too much is on your mind
Gotta let it go
Can't worry all the time
Just let it flow
You say you need a break
There's nothing I can do
Sitting here listening to you
Baby, what's this you tell me
Things ain't been goin' your way
Just take it from me
It's gonna be alright
So let's go out tonight
And we can leave all our cares behind
Dance the night away
Party till the sun comes up
Go grab a friend
Get on the floor
Come on and dance, dance
Dance with me
DJ if you please
Nobody's on the wall
That's what I like
Come closer to me now
And hold me tight
Tell me just how
You're feeling right now
Are you really havin' a good time
Baby, what's this you tell me
Thing's ain't been goin' your way
Just take it from me
It's gonna be alright
So let's go out tonight
And we can leave all our cares behind
Dance the night away
Party till the sun comes up
Go grab a friend
Get on the floor
Come on and dance, dance
Dance with me
DJ if you please
Just let yourself go
Dance on the floor
Nobody's stopping you
Do what you wanna do
Just let the music take control
You can feel it in your soul
Come on and move your body to the groove
Up in the club
Out on the floor
Move to the beat
Dancing with me
DJ, DJ, play my music
Dance the night away
Just let yourself go
Dance on the floor
Nobody's stopping you
Do what you wanna do
Just let the music take control
You can feel it in your soul
Come on and move your body to the groove
Dance the night away
Party till the sun comes up
Go grab a friend
Get on the floor
Come on and dance, dance
Dance with me
DJ if you please
Dance the night away
Party till the sun comes up
Go grab a friend
Get on the floor
Come on and dance, dance
Dance with me
DJ if you please
