<song artist="Jennifer_Lopez" title="The_Point">
its a good thing that i cant sleep
but i stay up all night a start to weep
like a willow tree cought in the rain
i get that thought again and agian 
i cloose my eyes but sece to dream
like i lost time an empty steam
of thoughts runnin through my head
and i wake and wish world was dead
turn turnin in to sunlight
my skin dont burn as i fall fall in full flight
i bloom with flower
soft the rain 
im stern like a tower
again and again
i cry 
cry with the wolves they stare
and i think am i really there
walk down arond and around
the people talking but theres no sound
climbing the mountain swimin the ocean 
cry but see nothing is there some solotion 
look down around 
why cant i fall into picture
no sound (no sound)
is there any victor 
turn turnin in to sunlight
my skin dont burn as i fall fall in full flight
i bloom with flower
soft the rain 
im stern like a tower
again and again
i cry 
cry with the wolves they stare
and i think am i really there
i live a life of hurt and pain
all wanta do is the chain
yeah yeah think about it
people only stop to spit 
im out to steal i dont deserve
round the bend i drop the curve
turn turnin in to sunlight
my skin dont burn as i fall fall in full flight
i bloom with flower
soft the rain 
im stern like a tower
again and again
i cry 
cry with the wolves they stare
and i think am i really there
