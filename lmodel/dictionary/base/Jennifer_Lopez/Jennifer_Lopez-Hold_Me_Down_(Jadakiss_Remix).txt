[Jadakiss:]
I gotta know
Would you hold me down in brooklyn, queens, the lox don't know
The globe fulla hoes
The flocka snow don't take me to jail
The asscracks flashbacks on sail
Sail like the queen of Jamaca
That's a licences to carry
Oh well....
Would ya hold me down?
[Fat Joe:]
Even if the world's against me.
Girl I gotta know if ya with me.
[J-Lo:]
I'ma hold you down.
No matter the situation.
The whole wide world can't take us.
[Jadakiss:]
Would ya hold me down?
[Fat Joe:]
Even if the cops arrest me.
Girl I gotta know you're comin' to get me.
[Jadakiss:]
Would ya hold me down?
[J-Lo:]
Baby I'ma hold you down.
You know I'm gonna hold you down.
(you down)]
[Missy Elliot:]
O'd love to hold down niggaz in my own ways
Today is the day 
when we just f**k
buck tuck crunk hop,
the copps can't take you, The lox won't shake you
[J-Lo:]
No matter what you go through yeah I gotcha.
And no matter what they do they can't stop us.
Who was the one that went all out for you?
Stashed cash in bags while you made your move.
And there ain't nothin' Hollywood wanna jump off.
If there's a problem I'ma ride Joe at any cost.
I'll be the one that reps strong for you.
If all else fails I'll do a bid with you.
[Fat Joe:]
You got the weight of the world on my shoulders.
And the x in my chest.
Man these villains is vultures and I'm sentenced to death.
But your face is the best crack at it.
Raps baddest god damn it.
Ain't no body f**kin' with us.
So similar to those one in the pants.
Don't nobody want listen till them things go bam.
Yep, yeah I'm about my cash.
Got my dough but then again you already know.
[Jadakiss:]
Would ya hold me down?
[Fat Joe:]
Even if the world's against me.
Girl I gotta know if ya with me.
[J-Lo:]
I'ma hold you down.
No matter the situation.
The whole wide world can't take us.
[Jadakiss:]
Would ya hold me down?
[Fat Joe:]
Even if the cops arrest me.
Girl I gotta know you're comin' to get me.
[Jadakiss:]
Would ya hold me down?
[J-Lo:]
Baby I'ma hold you down.
You know I'm gonna hold you down.
(you down)]
[T.I.:]
I refuse to lose, I rather give these weak dudes the blues
And separate them from they jewels, teach 'em don'ts and do's
I raise tools, make crews make decisions confused
All spectators can say is, "This lil' nigga's a fool"
A short fuse with some loose screws, some unscrewed
Better prove, you niggaz pussy as the Moulan Rouge
So who guardin' who, you know who to you know what
To you know where, goin' 'gainst 'em's too unfair
'Cause everywhere you do a show he got kinfolk there
Now you know I ain't noÂ ?, I got ten folk there
They ain't powerful as the one at the end of your prayer
Got you runnin' for your life without a minute to spare
Catch you dead to the granite, melt the grease in your hair
When I go, them boys is gonna be indecent affair
Guarantee you nah a real nigga breathin' accounted
At your funeral, just your parents and the preacher was there
Hollow, television name-dropper reachin' for help
So I ain't gotta say a word, pimp you beatin' ya'self
You gon' get what you deserve for disrespectin' the game
Any nigga with the nerve to say another man name
When that other man ain't even present
And deny it when somebody ask him about it
That nigga's a lame, you like to lie on the mic
Hide behind fame, I was a G when I came
That's the way I remain
[Jadakiss:]
Would ya hold me down?
[Fat Joe:]
Even if the world's against me.
Girl I gotta know if ya with me.
[J-Lo:]
I'ma hold you down.
No matter the situation.
The whole wide world can't take us.
[Jadakiss:]
Would ya hold me down?
[Fat Joe:]
Even if the cops arrest me.
Girl I gotta know you're comin' to get me.
[Jadakiss:]
Would ya hold me down?
[J-Lo:]
Baby I'ma hold you down.
You know I'm gonna hold you down.
(you down)]
[Fat Joe:]
This is the t-e-r-r-o-r squad.
Who else hold it down like ya nigga Joe.
I'ma spit that ross's 9-2.
Take ya back when I hit ya with that flow Joe track.
Yeah I bought u that pun Jlo's the same.
Young boys try and mimic sayin' they spitin' that game.
From New York to new heights to new fights.
Of course I'm out it let's talk about it
Yeah you ain't never been a nigga more fish.
Yup first they wanna love ya then they wanna dish.
You haven't seen it all and I ain't tryin' to stress ya at all.
But I ain't got no where else to go.
[J-Lo:]
Joe I never gave you a reason to doubt.
And there was never a time I didn't look out.
There's not a situation that we can't get through.
There's never been a night I didn't pray for you.
See I'll dedicate my life till the very end.
Cause at the end of it all I know I had a friend.
So let them all believe what they heard.
I'll let my actions speak louder than words.
So anytime you need me for whatever.
You could call my phone.
We could handle this together.
Shotgun by your side in the Carara.
It's all or nothin' that's how we do yeah.
I talk of everything I'm still that chick.
To hold you down cos my pockets are thick.
Cause you know I do that movie shit that runway shit.
Not to compare me to your average bitch.
[Fat Joe]
All or nothin' how I feel these days.
Hate stronger than tsunami ways.
I know you know the feeling.
Talkin' about that tabloid shit.
Paparazzi they can suck my dick.
Well I guess I guess they know now.
When it comes to holdin' you down.
Everybody know how I get down.
Yup, yup, yup, yup
[J-Lo]
So I guess I guess you know now.
When it comes to holdin' you down.
Everybody know how I gets down.
When it comes to you I do anything you ask me to.
[Jadakiss:]
Would ya hold me down?
[Fat Joe:]
Even if the world's against me.
Girl I gotta know if ya with me.
[J-Lo:]
I'ma hold you down.
No matter the situation.
The whole wide world can't take us.
[Jadakiss:]
Would ya hold me down?
[Fat Joe:]
Even if the cops arrest me.
Girl I gotta know you're comin' to get me.
[Jadakiss:]
Would ya hold me down?
[J-Lo:]

You know I'm gonna hold you down.
