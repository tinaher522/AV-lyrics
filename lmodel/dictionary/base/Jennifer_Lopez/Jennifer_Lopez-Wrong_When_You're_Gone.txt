<song artist="Jennifer_Lopez" title="Wrong_When_You're_Gone">
Guess I Should Have Shut My Mouth
But I Had To Get It Out
So Much For Being Headstrong
Now Im, Going Halfway Out My Mind
I Know I Was Outta Line
No Scratch That, I Was Dead Wrong
Know I Shoulda Let It Go 
But I Just Had To Be Right
Coulda Left It Alone
But No, I Had To Be Right
Swear I Woulda Just Fell Back 
If I Knew All I'd Be Left With Is These
Shoulda, Coulda, Wouldas Cuz You're Gone
Now Im Here Trippin
Cuz You Came Up Missin
And My Head Keeps Spinnin
It's Gettin Outta Control
I'm Backin Down This Time
I Don't Wanna Fight
I Don't Care Who's Right
Cuz I'm Wrong When You're Gone
When You're Gone
Cuz I'm Wrong When You're Gone
When You're Gone
Cuz I'm Wrong When You're Gone
When You're Gone
Heaven knows if you were here 
I'd be all up in your ear
Least you could do is answer your phone 
Cause I realize my mistake
Baby I'll do what it takes 
if I could just get you one on one 
Know I Shoulda Let It Go 
But I Just Had To Be Right
Coulda Left It Alone
But No, I Had To Be Right
Swear I Woulda Just Fell Back 
If I Knew All I'd Be Left With Is These
Shoulda, Coulda, Wouldas Cuz You're Gone
Now Im Here Trippin
Cuz You Came Up Missin
And My Head Keeps Spinnin
It's Gettin Outta Control
I'm Backin Down This Time
I Don't Wanna Fight
I Don't Care Who's Right
Cuz I'm Wrong When You're Gone
When You're Gone
Cuz I'm Wrong When You're Gone
When You're Gone
Cuz I'm Wrong When You're Gone
When You're Gone
I Know I Pushed You Out
Runnin Off At The Mouth
Sayin All The Wrong Things
Callin You Out Your Name
I Was Unpredictable
I Was So Emotional
I Swear I'm Gonna Do Better
Can We Get This Back Together Again
Cuz I'm Wrong When You're Gone
When You're Gone
Cuz I'm Wrong When You're Gone
When You're Gone
Cuz I'm Wrong When You're Gone
When You're Gone
