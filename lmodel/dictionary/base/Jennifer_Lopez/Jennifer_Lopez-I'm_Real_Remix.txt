<song artist="Jennifer_Lopez" title="I'm_Real_Remix">
What's my motherfuckin' name?
R u l e
Blowin' back on this Mary Jane
And I'm analyzin' the game
And the game done chose me
To bring pain to pussy niggas and pussy holes
They one in the same
Ever since you told me
There's only room for two
I've been makin' less room for you
Now only God can hold me
Hug me, love me, judge me
The only man that hovers above me, holla
I've met so many men
And it's like they're all the same
My appetite for lovin'
Is now my hunger, pain
And when I'm feeling sexy
Who's gonna comfort me?
My only problem is
Their insecurity
Tired of bein' alone?
Yeah, yeah
Sick of arguin' on the phone?
Yeah, yeah
Why you tellin' all your friends?
Yeah, yeah
That your nigga don't understand
My love
'Cause I'm real
The way you walk, the way you move, the way you talk
'Cause I'm real
The way you stare, the way you look, your style, your hair
'Cause I'm real
The way you smile, the way you smell, it drives me wild
'Cause I'm real
And I can't go on without you
Girl, I've been thinkin' about this relationship
(Relationship)
And I wanna know is this as good as it get
(As good as it get)
'Cause we been through the worst times, and the best times
(The worst times, and the best times)
But it was our time, even if it was part time
(Part time)
Now they been lookin' at me, smilin' at me
Laughin' like we wasn't happy
But not knowing that we growin' and we gettin' married
Hard lovin', straight thuggin'
(Hard lovin', straight thuggin')
Bitch, I ain't doin' this shit for nothin'
I'm here to get it poppin' and hoppin'
(Poppin' and hoppin')
Let's ride out in the Benz
Hair blowin' in the wind, sun glistenin' off my skin
Hey, I'm nasty, heh, you know me
But still gonna fuck with your baby
'Cause I'm real
The way you walk, the way you move, the way you talk
'Cause I'm real
The way you stare, the way you look, your style, your hair
'Cause I'm real
The way you smile, the way you smell, it drives me wild
'Cause I'm real
And I can't go on without you
Now people lovin' me and hatin' me
Treatin' me ungratefully
But not knowin' that they ain't makin' or breakin' me
My life, I live it to the limit and I love it
Now I can breathe again
Baby, now I can breathe again
Now people screamin'
"What the deal with you and so and so?"
I tell 'em niggas mind their biz but they don't hear me though
'Cause I live my life to the limit and I love it
Now I can breathe again
Baby, now I can breathe again
Tired of bein' alone?
Yeah, yeah
Sick of arguin' on the phone?
Yeah, yeah
Why you tellin' all your friends?
Yeah, yeah
That your nigga don't understand
My love
'Cause I'm real
The way you walk, the way you move, the way you talk
'Cause I'm real
The way you stare, the way you look, your style, your hair
'Cause I'm real
The way you smile, the way you smell, it drives me wild
'Cause I'm real
And I can't go on without you
'Cause I'm real
The way you walk, the way you move, the way you talk
'Cause I'm real
The way you stare, the way you look, your style, your hair
'Cause I'm real
The way you smile, the way you smell, it drives me wild
'Cause I'm real
And I can't go on without you
