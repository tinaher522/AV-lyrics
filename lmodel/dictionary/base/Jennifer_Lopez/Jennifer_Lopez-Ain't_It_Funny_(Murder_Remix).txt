Murder Inc.
It must be the ass
That got me like damn
If it get any fatter
Man the rule gonna hafta get at her
And our situation won't matter
I come to make you smile
In the freakiest manners
J to the L-O
Hello, no I'm not Lee Harvey Oswald
I'm the rule in the shot call
Off the wall
Like M.J. in his early days
It's the Inc. and Lopez now
Ain't it funny
It's been awhile since you came around
Now you wanna see what's goin' down
Tryin' to tell me how you want my time
Tryin' to tell me how I'm on your mind (on your mind)
See it never had to be this way
You should play the games you played
Now I'm seein' that you're kind of lame
Knowin' how the situation changed
Ain't it funny
Baby, that you want me, when you had me
Love is crazy, now I can smile and say
Ain't it funny
Baby, that you want me, when you had me
Love is crazy, I'm glad I can smile and say
Ain't it funny
I remember how you walked away
Even when I tried to call your name
See at first I didn't understand
Now you're lookin' like a lonely man lonely man
I remember how you did me wrong
And now you're hurtin' 'cause my love is gone
Everybody gets a chance to burn
You can take it as a lesson learned
Ain't it funny
Baby, that you want me, when you had me
Love is crazy, now I can smile and say
Ain't it funny
Baby, that you want me, when you had me
Love is crazy, I'm glad I can smile and say
Ain't it funny
C-A double D, Hi
Double dose my
Fly by, red line
Touch the roast side
Oh I, never been a sucker for chocha
Spit the ism, hit 'em, get rid of 'em, and you know Tah
Get it gully and ain't that funny
How they want me, see me workin' wit' money?
But Cali ain't a dummy
What these brodies want from me
'Cause all I got is G, J.Lo
And Murda Inc.?
I really wish you wouldn't send me gifts
Tryin' to make me sit and reminisce
Tryin' to blind me with your bling bling
Thought I told you love don't cost a thing (love don't cost a thing)
Hope you realize that now I'm through
And I don't ever wanna hear from you
I ain't had enough of bein' there for you
Now I'm laughin' while you play the fool
Ain't it funny
Baby, that you want me, when you had me
Love is crazy, now I can smile and say
Ain't it funny
Baby, that you want me, when you had me
Love is crazy, I'm glad I can smile and say
Ain't it funny
Baby, is that your girlfriend?
I got my boyfriend
But maybe we can be friends
La da da da da da
Baby, I got my boyfriend
Is that your girlfriend?
Maybe we can be friends
La da da da da da
