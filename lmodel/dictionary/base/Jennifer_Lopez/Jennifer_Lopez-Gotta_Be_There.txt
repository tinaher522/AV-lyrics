<song artist="Jennifer_Lopez" title="Gotta_Be_There">
I wanna be where you are
Could it be I stayed away too long?
I wanna be where you are
Could it be I stayed away too long?
I remember
I said we should split
Had a lot goin' on
And you weren't part of it
You tried to reason with me, I admit
But I dipped
Now I'm walkin' around so, so sick
Now I'm fiendin' for you, that's a fact
Got me missin' you
Like LA misses Shaq
What I gotta do
On my mission to get you back
Because I'm just that way without you
Baby, baby, I
Really didn't mean it
When I said it, I'll repeat it
I was trippin' flippin' out
I was a non-sense
I was on a whole other level
Now I got it all together
I was sick, but now I'm better
I was trying to push you away
Really wanted you to stay
Didn't know that was the case
It was just plain crazy 'cause around here lately
Been thinkin' about nothing but my baby
If you're in Houston
Baby, I gotta be there
Hosted in Atlanta
Baby, I gotta be there
Chillin' in New York
Baby, I gotta be there
Somewhere out in Puerto Rico
Baby, I gotta be there
If you're in Chicago
Baby, I gotta be there
Hangin' out in the MIA
Baby, I gotta be there
Maybe you can be in LA
Baby, I gotta be there
I just wanna be your lady
Baby, I gotta be there
I wanna be where you are
(I gotta be there)
Could it be I stayed away too long?
I wanna be where you are
(I wanna be where you are)
Could it be I stayed away too long?
What's gone is gone
And I wanna take it back
I'm not livin' in the past
But now I want you back
Gotta get you, gotta get you here, here
I been looking for you everywhere
Everywhere, baby
I'd apologize a thousand times to you if I could prove, prove
Baby, I'm running out of breath
for being around the world tryin' to get to you
Really didn't mean it
When I said it, I'll repeat it
I was trippin' flippin' out
I was a non-sense
I was on a whole other level
Now I got it all together
I was sick, but now I'm better
I was trying to push you away
Really wanted you to stay
Didn't know that was the case
It was just plain crazy 'cause around here lately
Been thinkin' about nothing but my baby
If you're in Houston
Baby, I gotta be there
Hosted in Atlanta
Baby, I gotta be there
Chillin' in New York
Baby, I gotta be there
Somewhere out in Puerto Rico
Baby, I gotta be there
If you're in Chicago
Baby, I gotta be there
Hangin' out in the MIA
Baby, I gotta be there
Maybe you can be in LA
Baby, I gotta be there
I just wanna be your lady
Baby, I gotta be there
I wanna be where you are
Could it be I stayed away too long?
Come back to me
Could it be I stayed away too long?
If you're in Houston
Baby, I gotta be there
Hosted in Atlanta
Baby, I gotta be there
Chillin' in New York
Baby, I gotta be there
Somewhere out in Puerto Rico
Baby, I gotta be there
If you're in Chicago
Baby, I gotta be there
Hangin' out in the MIA
Baby, I gotta be there
Maybe you can be in LA
Baby, I gotta be there
I just wanna be your lady
Baby, I gotta be there
I gotta be there
If you're in Houston
Baby, I gotta be there
Hosted in Atlanta
Baby, I gotta be there
Chillin' in New York
Baby, I gotta be there
Somewhere out in Puerto Rico
Baby, I gotta be there
If you're in Chicago
Baby, I gotta be there
Hangin' out in the MIA
Baby, I gotta be there
Maybe you can be in LA
Baby, I gotta be there
I just wanna be your lady
Baby, I gotta be there
I wanna be where you are
Could it be I stayed away too long?
