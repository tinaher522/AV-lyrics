<song artist="Jennifer_Lopez" title="He'll_Be_Back">
I know better than anybody how it feels
To want somebody so bad after you break up
Still looking for that phone call
Still even when they don't call
Still ain't ready to walk away and call it over
Act like you wasn't listening when they told you
They don't wanna be with you anymore
Stuck in your ways, you choose to ignore
'Cause in your mind, you're still together
Thought it would last but there's no forever
Walked out on you with no call, no letter
When he realized it don't get no better
He'll be back to make up for the lonely days
He'll be back when things ain't working out his way
He'll be back when he sees that it's not the same
He'll be back, he'll be back
He'll be back, he'll be back
He'll be back, he knows he's gonna need his lady
He'll be back when his boys say he must be crazy
He'll be back, he'll know he made a big mistake
He'll be back, he'll be back
He'll be back, he'll be back
He'll be back
You don't wanna believe it but you see it happening
Wakes you up outta your sleep, outta the dreams you're having
Still looking for his return
Still hoping that he's gonna learn
Wake up and realize the truth
Make some time for you
What's he trying to do to you
You miss him more as days go by
Try your hardest not to cry and keep hope alive
'Cause in your mind, you're still together
Thought it would last but there's no forever
Walked out on you with no call, no letter
When he realized it don't get no better
He'll be back to make up for the lonely days
He'll be back when things ain't working out his way
He'll be back when he sees that it's not the same
He'll be back, he'll be back
He'll be back, he'll be back
He'll be back, he knows he's gonna need his lady
He'll be back when his boys say he must be crazy
He'll be back, he'll know he made a big mistake
He'll be back, he'll be back
He'll be back, he'll be back
He'll be back
Watching his
Every move
Wanting him is
Haunting you
Thinking his
Every move
Wanting him is
Haunting you
He'll be back
Watching his
Every move
Wanting him is
Haunting you
Thinking his
Every move
Wanting him is
Haunting you
He'll be back to make up for the lonely days
He'll be back when things ain't working out his way
He'll be back when he sees that it's not the same
He'll be back, he'll be back
He'll be back, he'll be back
He'll be back, he knows he's gonna need his lady
He'll be back when his boys say he must be crazy
He'll be back, he'll know he made a big mistake
He'll be back, he'll be back
He'll be back, he'll be back
He'll be back
