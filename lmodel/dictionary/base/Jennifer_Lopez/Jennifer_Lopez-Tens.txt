<song artist="Jennifer_Lopez" title="Tens">
Clap bitches clap
Clap bitches clap
Snap bitches snap
Snap
I’m calling out legends, statements, and stars
I wanna see legends, statements, and stars
Pick up plow girl
I wanna see runway
I wanna see own way
I wanna see new way
I wanna see you sway
Eating the runway, serving the runway
Marching the runway, eat that runway
Eating the runway, serving the runway
Marching the runway, eat that runway
Walk
Give me your heart
Leave it out on the floor tonight
You’re perfect, you’re living
You’re so beautiful
Tens across the board
Half of us came off a flight
We came together for this one night
I wanna see you leave it all on the floor
Girls get ready
Cause here I come
Where my face kids at
Where my glam queens at
Where my real queens at
You want it, take it to the back
Where my sirens at
European runway at
Labels and pumps at
You want it, take it to the back
On the runway
Where we don’t play
I want it my way
Don’t be shady, be a lady, go crazy
On the runway
Where we don’t play
I want it my way
Don’t be shady, be a lady, go crazy
Give me your heart
Leave it out on the floor tonight
You’re perfect, you’re living
You’re so beautiful
Tens across the board
Half of us came off a flight
We came together for this one night
I wanna see you leave it all on the floor
Girls get ready
Cause here I come
We serve bitch
We don't work bitch
We serve bitch
Cause here I come
Can I see
Walk for me
Twirl for me
Serve for me
Lanvin, Ebony, Icon
Infinity, Cannes
Chanel, Balenciaga
Prodigy, Ninja, Laveija
Milan, Omni, Mizrahi
Extravaganza, Garçon
New glare
Look at me, look at me, bitch
Look at me, look at me, bitch
M to the I to the motherfucking Z
You can’t help but look at me
The elements, elements
The elements, elements
The elements, elements
All five elements
Look at me, look at me, bitch
Look at me, look at me, bitch
M to the I to the motherfucking Z
You can’t help but look at me
Five
