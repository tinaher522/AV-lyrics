<song artist="Jennifer_Lopez" title="Take_Care">
Glass of wine
Candlelight
Music made for quiet times
I'm feelin' mellow
I need my
Sweetie pie
Here to lay me out tonight
I want it
I want it
But I can't get it
Take good care of me tonight
At home
I'm so alone
I'm wishin' you were here
Baby tonight
My bed is cold
I'm wishin' you were near
Cause I'm in a sexy mood
And only you can fill my needs
I'll lay here
And take care of it
'Til you come home to me
Always sound sensuous
Anytime we pillow talk
Using such few words
I get sensitive when you work
It feels so good when it hurts
Always want more and more
And I know you can't be here
That usually don't faze me
I need you tonight
Boy it's drivin' me crazy
Yearnin' inside
With this burnin' desire
I want it
I want it
But I just can't get it from you
Take good care of me tonight
At home
I'm so alone
I'm wishin' you were here
Baby tonight 
My bed is cold
I'm wishin' you were near
Cause I'm in a sexy mood
And only you can fill my needs
I'll lay here
And take care of it
'Til you come home to me
Ah ah
Take care of me
Ah ah
Fufill my needs
Ah ah, 
Take care of me
Take good care
Ah ah
Take care of me
Ah ah
Fufill my needs
Ah ah
Whatever you can be
Ah ah
I'll take good care of me
Take good care of me tonight
At home
I'm so alone
I'm wishin' you were here
Baby tonight
My bed is cold
I'm wishin' you were near
Cause I'm in a sexy mood
And only you can fill my needs
I'll lay here
And take care of it
'Til you come home to me
Ah ah
Take care of me
Ah ah
Fufill my needs
Ah ah
Take care of me
Take good care
Ah ah
Take care of me
Ah ah
Fufill my needs
Ah ah
Whatever you can be
Ah ah
I'll take care of me
