Break it off here, break, break it off there,
Break it off here, break, break it off there,
Break it off here, break, break it off there,
Break it off here, break, break it off there,
Okay ladies, you got your drink in your left hand,
Put your right hand on your hip,
Now bounce your knees back, alternate back and fourth,
And if you're doing it right, your hips will be doing the same thing, let's go,
Cubano, boricua, ay que rica, dale chica,
Cubano, boricua, ay que rica!
Now don't tell me that you love me to get with this,
You say you stay forever but it don't make sense,
Maybe you're a balla, I hope you don't miss,
Cause if not you ain't gonna get none of this,
I only wanna hear swish, I'm a big girl I know what it is,
Bentley steering wheel is in that fist,
Pick me up at 8, yeah don't you wish,
Love, Fresh Out the Oven, straight sugar lovin', to the beat I love it, hey,
You wanna break it off here, break, break it off there,
You wanna break it off here, break, break it off there,
You wanna break it off here, break, break it off there,
They wanna break it off here, break, break it off there,
Be real, you can say who you are,
Everybody say they a doctor at the bar,
You gotta look close to find a real superstar,
You international, shit I open up the job,
I'm right so far, help yourself and take a look in the mirror,
Open up your mouth and stick your tongue out far,
Just a little more, okay say ah!
Love, Fresh Out the Oven, straight sugar lovin', to the beat I love it, hey,
You wanna break it off here, break, break it off there,
You wanna break it off here, break, break it off there,
You wanna break it off here, break, break it off there,
They wanna break it off here, break, break it off there,
L O V E, let's not mess around, we both know what we need,
Now here is what I want, understand me when I say,
Make it last, okay?
You say you want the cookie, you gonna have to wait for the cookie,
No touchy touchy, only looky looky,
Mama you S E X Y, lips, eyes, hips, thighs,
That's right, that's right, that's right,
Kiss the game goodbye, yeah just kiss it, muah, 305, that's right, that's right, 
Na I ain't Jada, I'm the past, I'm the present, I'm the now, I'm the later,
Love, Fresh Out the Oven, straight sugar lovin', to the beat I love it, hey,
You wanna break it off here, break, break it off there,
You wanna break it off here, break, break it off there,
You wanna break it off here, break, break it off there,
They wanna break it off here, break, break it off there,
Cubano, boricua, ay que rica, dale chica,
Cubano, boricua, ay que rica, dale chica.
