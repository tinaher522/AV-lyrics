<song artist="Jennifer_Lopez" title="The_One_(Alternate_Version)">
Takin' away...
The fact that I care about you...
It's just your way...
So sweet...
Everything seems right around you...
Did you know... 
That you...
Have this calmin' way about you, in your touch...
And I wanna know, if I can be your girl...
You are everything...
And everything is you...(ooohhh)
You are everything...
And everything is you...
I'm happy to say...
In a lot of ways, you changed me...
Makes me smile..
When you said you were glad the day you found me...
I'm wishin' away..
Any hope I might ever find you...
Heaven knows...
I really feel..I'll always be your girl... 
You are everything...
And everything is you...(ooohhh)
You are everything...
And everything is you...
You are everything...
And everything is you...(ooohhh)
You are everything...
And everything is you...
The one who puts her arms around you...
The one who lays her beside you...
The one who listens when you need it...
When no one else sees, I could see it... 
The one who puts her arms around you...
The one who lays her beside you...
The one who listens when you need it...
When no one else sees, I could see it... 
The one who knows when it's somethin's wrong,
The one who knows ur favorite song,
The one your family loves, 
The one you place no one above,
You are everything...
And everything is you...(ooohhh)
You are everything...
And everything is you...
You are everything...
And everything is you...(ooohhh)
You are everything...
And everything is you...
The one who's true to you, I'm down for ya,
The one who makes you smile, and laughs with ya,
The one who holds you down,
I'm the one, I'm the one, I'm the one, I'm the one..
The one who makes you smile, and laughs with ya,
The one who holds you down,
The one, I'm the one, I'm the one,
The one who's true to you, I'm down for ya,
The one who makes you smile, and laughs with ya,
The one who holds you down,
I'm the one, I'm the one, I'm the one, I'm the one..
The one who makes you smile, and laughs with ya,
The one who holds you down,
The one, I'm the one, I'm the one,
The one who's true to you, I'm down for ya,
The one who makes you smile, and laughs with ya,
The one who holds you down,
I'm the one, I'm the one, I'm the one, I'm the one..
The one who makes you smile, and laughs with ya,
The one who holds you down,
The one, I'm the one, I'm the one,
I can be everything you need...
