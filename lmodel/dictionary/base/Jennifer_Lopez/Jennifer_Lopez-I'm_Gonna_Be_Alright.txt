Oh yes
It's funny coz for a while
I Walked around with a smile
But... deep inside, I could hear
Voices telling me "This ain't right"
Don't you know, it's not for you
I always knew what I had to do
But it's hard to get away
Cause I love you I just got to stay
You used to say I couldn't do it but I did it (Yes I did)
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it (Oh yeah)
Though it brings tears to my eyes I can feel it
And I know inside that I'm gonna be alright (Gonna be alright)
I said I couldn't do it but I did it (Yes I did)
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it (Oh yeah)
Though it brings tears to my eyes I can feel it
And that voice inside says I'm gonna be alright (Gonna be alright)
Friends of mine say to me
Say you got control over me
You're not alone, I played my part
I saw the way you were from the start
Could I expect so much from you
You had a girl when I first met you
Did the best that you could do
Now I realize I can't change you
You used to say I couldn't do it but I did it (Yes I did)
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it (Oh yeah)
Though it brings tears to my eyes I can feel it
And I know inside that I'm gonna be alright (Gonna be alright)
I said I didn't do it but I did it (Yes I did)
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it (Oh yeah)
Though it brings tears to my eyes I can feel it
And that voice inside says I'm gonna be alright (Gonna be alright)
Said I wouldn't walk away
Some days I want to stay (Days I want to stay)
But leaving you is what I need to do (Need to do)
To be OK (I need to be OK)
I never thought it would be true (Would be true)
Me living without you (Living without you) 
So now it's time for me to make that move
You used to say I couldn't do it but I did it (Yes I did)
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it (Oh yeah)
Though it brings tears to my eyes I can feel it
And I know inside that I'm gonna be alright (Gonna be alright)
I said I couldn't do it but I did it (Yes I did)
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it (Oh yeah)
Though it brings tears to my eyes I can feel it
And that voice inside says I'm gonna be alright (Gonna be alright)
