Forgiving him
Was the first thing I had to do
In order to move on
Forgetting it was not as easy to do
I had to teach myself to be strong
And it's so easy to be scared
When I think of all that I shared
When I think of how he made me feel
The bad and the good
Sometimes I wish I could take it back
But we can't go back -- gotta keep moving
It's all good
Don't wanna hear no woulda, coulda
Maybe I shoulda
Stayed with someone who never knew that I was true
It's all good
Now that I'm going forward
Now that I'm growing
Now that I know it
Never gonna give up on
Never gonna give up on love
Never gonna give up on love
I have to admit
You weren't the only one at fault
I was at wrong too
Trying to be someone I wasn't
I thought I could make myself happy with you
And its so easy to be scared
When I think of all that I shared
When I think of how he made me feel
The bad and the good
Sometimes I wish I could take it back
But we can't go back -- gotta keep moving
It's all good
Don't wanna hear no woulda, coulda
Maybe I shoulda
Stayed with someone who never knew that I was true
It's all good
Now that I'm going forward
Now that I'm growing
Now that I know it
Never gonna give up on
Never gonna give up on love
Never gonna give up on love
I knew I was going to get through it
Breaking up is hard to do
But I had to do it
It had something to do with me figuring it out
What this is all about
When it came to me, when it comes to me, gotta do what best for me
It's all good
Don't wanna hear no woulda, coulda
Maybe I shoulda
Stayed with someone who never knew that I was true
It's all good
Now that I'm going forward
Now that I'm growing
Now that I know it
Never gonna give up on
Never gonna give up on love
Never gonna give up on love
