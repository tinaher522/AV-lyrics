<song artist="Jennifer_Lopez" title="Whipping_My_Hair">
I just met infactuation
It's something in his smile
Now my obsession
Is tender thoughts of you
Something takes over
Pulls me up
Onto my feet
Before I know it
I got you pushing up
On me
On the floor
Under the burning lights
Dreaming look behind
Hands on this
Waist of mine
And I don't know
Where this will lead
But I'm hoping
You tell me
Out here
Whipping my hair
All crazy
Baby
Doin' it like
I'm at work
I'm making that
Thang jump
I'm making that thang twirk
(So get up on it babe)
I'm doing what I do
I make it move
Got me out here
Whipping my hair
Awww
Baby
I just might have
What you need
Sprinkling you
With pieces of me
Now let's make it
A sight to see
Baby
On the floor
Under the burning lights
Screaming look behind
Hands on this
Waist of mine
And I don't know
Where this will lead
But I'm hoping
You tell me
Out her
Whipping my hair
All crazy
Baby
Doin' it like
I'm at work
I'm making that thang jump
I'm making that thang twirk
(So get up on it baby)
I'm doin'
What I do
I make it move
Got me out here
Whipping my hair
Awww
We flashing pictures
Kodak moment memory
Look at the flickers
Sparks on my camera screen
The buried treasure
Come with me
And we will find
Create a perfect world
Just for you and I
On the floor
Under the
Burning lights
Screaming look behind
Hands on this
Waist of mine
And I don't know
Where this will lead
But I'm hoping
You tell me
Out here
Whipping my hair
All crazy
Baby
Doin' it like
I'm at work
I'm making that thang jump
I'm making that thang twirk
(So get up on it baby)
I'm doin'
What I do
I make it move
Got me out here
Whipping my hair
Awww
Babe
I just might have
What you need
Sprinkling you
With pieces of me
Now let's make it
A sight to see
Baby
On the floor
Under the
Burning lights
Screaming look behind
Hands on this
Waist of mine
And I don't know
Where this will lead
But I'm hoping
You tell me
Out here
Whipping my hair
All crazy
Baby
