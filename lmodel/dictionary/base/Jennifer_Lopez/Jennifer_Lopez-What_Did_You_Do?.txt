<song artist="Jennifer_Lopez" title="What_Did_You_Do?">
Yesterday we both dreamed with a perfect world
Yesterday we had too many words coming out of our lips
Because with our eyes we spyed our souls
and the truth didn't dance in your look.
Yesterday we promised to conquer the whole world
Yesterday you promised me this love would be forever
Because mistaken once is enough
to learn what is love truly
What did you do? Today you destroyed with your pride the hope
Today you wet with your fury my eyes
You erased all our story with your hate
and you mistook so much the love I gave you
With a licence to break my soul
What did you do? You made us destroy the mornings
and our nights drowned in your words
My illusions ended with your arguments
You forgot that it was love what counted
and with your hands you destroyed our house

Tomorrow a new day in my universe will come
Tomorrow I wont see your name written between my verses
I wont hear words of shame
I will ignore with joy your remorse
Tomorrow I will forget that yesterday I was your truthful lover
Tomorrow there will not even be reasons to hate you
I will erase all your dreams in my dreams
That the wind will carry forever your memories
What did you do? Today you destroyed with your pride the hope
Today you wet with your fury my eyes
You erased all our story with your hate
and you mistook so much the love I gave you
With a licence to break my soul
What did you do? You made us destroy the mornings
and our nights drowned in your words
My illusions ended with your arguments
You forgot that it was love what counted
and with your hands you destroyed our house
