<song artist="Jennifer_Lopez" title="Loving_You">
Would you mind
If I took the time to get to know you
Cause its been a while since all we been through
And even though I said my feelings wouldn't change
Nothing stays the same... ooh...
I can see
When I look in your eyes you mean no harm
It's just the way you manipulate me with your charm
And I could tell the love I had for you still strong
And there ain't nothin wrong with me still lovin you...
After all that we've  been through
I find myself still lovin you
But I think we need to take the time to get it right
Cause I never give up on the good thing
I never gave up on the love we had
We just need to take it slow
In the past
You would act as if you don't really care
You would fight and argue almost anywhere
Lookin back sometimes I feel like such a fool
For putting up with you... ooh...
Baby please, understand me
If it seems Im confused
Its just that it might take me 
Some time to get used to you
When I think of all the things we used to do, baby
I just find myself still loving you
After all that we been through
I find myself still loving you
But I think we need to take the time to get it right
Cause I never give up on a good thing
I never gave up on the love we had, baby
We just need to take it slow
I believe you and me have a chance to make this right
Oh baby if your heart is in it
I'm still with it
Even after all this time has passed
Oh, I'm still loving you...
After all that we been through, yea yea
I find myself still loving you
But I think we need to take the time to get it right
Cause I never give up on a good thing
I never gave up on the love we had, baby
We just need to take it slow
After all that we been through
Found myself still lovin you
But I think we need to take the time to get it right
Cause I never gave up on a good thing, never give up
Never gave up on the love we had, love we had
We just need to take it slow
