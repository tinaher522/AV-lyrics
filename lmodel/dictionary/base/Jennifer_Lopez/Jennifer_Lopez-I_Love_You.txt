<song artist="Jennifer_Lopez" title="I_Love_You">
i love you! with all my heart
&amp; until i die we'll never be apart
if you feel the same let me know
&amp; if you don't let me go
i call you every night just to here you say hi
then i hang up &amp; close my eyes
i have a vision of you &amp; me holdin hands
i hear us makin future plans
i love to see you smie
you make everything worth while
i love it when you hold me tight
you never bring me to tears
with you i share my dreams,secrets,&amp; fears
when i'm with you i know i'm in love
i know god sent you from up above
you never tell me a lie 
you're the perfect guy
even when you act crazy 
i tell everyone "that's my baby"
i will never deny the love i have for you
but tell me do you love me too
it's you that i will always admire
you're my hopes dreams &amp; my one desire
my life before you was never this great
i'm happy free &amp; i have faith
i wish i could die 
standing by your side
i wanna be your wife
for the rest of my life
i'm the only girl for you in this world
so promise there won't be another girl
if i ever lost you i would brake down in cry
&amp; forever i would hide
if i cried you'd care
if i was hurt you'd be there
i just wanna let you know
that i would forever more
love you so
