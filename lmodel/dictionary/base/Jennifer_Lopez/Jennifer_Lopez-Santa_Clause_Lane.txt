<song artist="Jennifer_Lopez" title="Santa_Clause_Lane">
I remember last christmas eve
Something happened that i couldn't believe
I went for a walk while the snow came down
And when it stopped,I was in a different town
And the sign said have no fear,your not lost your here
Chorus:
Walkin this christmas
down santa claus lane
no need to wonder
no need explain
just have some faith in what you see
your right here where you wanna be
walkin this christmas down santa claus lane.
down santa claus lane
Elves were standing in the street
Snowmen and reindeer came out to greet
Silver bells chimed from far away
as Santa rode by in an open sleigh
and he told me have no fear
your not lost your here
Chorus:
Walkin this christmas
down santa claus lane
no need to wonder
no need to explian
just have some faith in what you see
your right here where you wanna be
walkin this christmas down santa claus lane
down santa claus lane
I don't know how
I don't know when
but one day i'll be back again
And he told me have no fear
your not lost your here....
Chorus:
Walkin this christmas down santa claus lane
no need to wonder
no need to explain
just have some faith in what you see
your right here where you want to be
Walkin this christmas down santa claus lane
(santa claus lane)
down santa claus lane
down santa claus lane
(santa claus lane)
down santa claus lane
