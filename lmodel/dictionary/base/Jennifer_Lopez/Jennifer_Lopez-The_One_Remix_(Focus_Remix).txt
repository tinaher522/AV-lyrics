[Joe Budden - Intro] (J.Lo)
(You don't do love, you do love, Joey do love)
Jenny, ha-ha we gon' do it like
[J. Lo]
Take it away, the fact that I can't without you
It's just your way, so sweet everything seems right around you
Did you know, that you, have this common way about you when you touch?
And I wanna know if I could your giirrllll...
[Chorus - Jennifer Lopez] (Repeat 4x)
You're everything, and everything is you
[J. Lo]
I'm happy to say in alot of ways you changed me makes me smart
When you said you were glad the day you found me
I picture the way any home if I never found you never know
I really feel all of it's real
[Chorus]
[Joe Budden]
Look haters is not good
Joey's lucky it's how she trusts me, it's how she touch me
It's how she Uhhh
Look at how she love me do that ma
Bottom line, I'm that guy and you that fly (Uhhh)
My baby make the haters all notice (What else?)
My baby get the haters more mo'
Joey so focused nothing I lack now (WHOA!)
Stop playin' Jen bring it back now (Let's go)
[J.Lo - Bridge]

The one who puts her arms around you
The one who lays her head beside you
The one who listens when you need it
When no one else is I just is
The one who knows when something's wrong
The one who knows your favorite song
The one who all your friends love
And your personal one to hug
[Chorus]
[J.Lo] (Joe Budden)
The one to turn to you, and down for you
The one who makes you smile and laughs with you
The one to hold you down I'm there for you
The one, the one, the one
The one to turn to you, and down for you
The one who makes you smile and laughs with you
The one to hold you down I'm there for you
The one, the one, the one
The one to turn to you, the one who makes you smile
Need to be your giirrll...
The one, the one, the one
Your girrrllllll..
The one to turn to you, the one who makes you smile
Your girrrllllll..
The one who holds you down
The one, the one, the one
I can be anything you need
(We gon' do it like, do it like rock with you oh!)
(Dubb, the banger ONE!)
