<song artist="Jennifer_Lopez" title="Talk_About_Us">
I saw you and fell in love
You saw me and fell in love too
You and me
We fell in love with each other Last night
I told you that I was concerned
You told me of your concerns too
Yet and still we both decided to make love last night
Baby please, tell me
Where do we go from here, my love
What are we doin baby
Boy you gotta let me know
Why can't we live the way we want
I want the world to know
I just got to let it show
What do we stand to lose
If being together is what we chose
Ooohh my love, I think that we should talk about us
Could this be a crazy dream
And if so'
Than you're dreaming to
Cause I know for sure that you feel the same as I do
(I know that you feel the same as I do)
Could it be that we could be wrong
Even though we're feeling so right
I don't care because I know that I want you tonight
And I know you want me too
Where do we go from here, my love
What are we doing babe
Boy you gotta let me know
Why can't we live the way we want
I want the world to know
I just got to let it show
What do we stand to lose
If being together is what we chose
Ooohh my love, I think that we should talk (about us)
You see all my life I waited
Waited all my life
Just to be with someone like you
Where do we go from here, my love
Where are we going baby
I wanna know
Why can't we live the way we want
I want the world to know
I just got to let it show
What do we stand to lose
If being together is what we choose
Ooohh my love I think that we should talk about us
