<song artist="Jennifer_Lopez" title="Dear_Ben">
I just can't control myself 
I can't be with no one else
It seems I'm addicted to the way you like to touch me
I don't think they understand why I love at your command
From the words you speak, so deep
Our bodies meet, I have to have you
I love you, you're perfect
A manifestation of my dreams
You make my body feel about a million different things
I think God made you for me, a mix of passion and fidelity
Baby, you're so complete
I write this song to let you know that you will always be to me
My lust, my love, my man, my child, my friend and my king 
I love you, you're perfect 
A manifestation of my dreams
You make my body feel about a million different things
There's no way I'd leave you
It's just not a reality
Sometimes I feel like I'm living in a fantasy
