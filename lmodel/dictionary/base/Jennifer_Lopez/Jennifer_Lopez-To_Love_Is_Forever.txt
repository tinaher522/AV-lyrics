<song artist="Jennifer_Lopez" title="To_Love_Is_Forever">
You invaded my heart
With this love that sometimes clouds the reason
And you can't think
I feel the same way too
From the first time I seen you, I was in love
I can't keep quiet anymore
CHOURS:
My love is forever
You're my reason, my peace
My light, my only truth
Love is givin with nothing to expect in return

You are how I dream
Your smile is the sun of every dawn
Without you, I don't know how I breath
I want to wake up next to you
In your body I found my other half
You taught me how to be a woman
(CHOURS)
Love is givin with nothing to expect in return
(CHOURS)
Love is givin with nothing to expect in return
