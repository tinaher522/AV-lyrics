I remember how you walked away 
Even when i tried to call your name 
See at first i didn't understand
Now your lookin like a lonely man (lonely man)
I remember how you did me wrong 
Now your hurtin 'cause my love is gone
Everybody gets a chance to burn
You can take it as a lesson learned 
Aint that funny (Aint it funny)
Baby that you want me when you had me
