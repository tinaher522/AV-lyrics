[Styles]
Children grow and women e
And men go work X, yeah
J Lo, yeah
Yeah, yo, yo
We off the block this year
Went from a load to a lot this year
Everybody mad at the rocks that I wear
I know where I'm going and I know where I'm from
You hear Lox in the air
Yeah we at the airport out in D-Block
From the block where everybody Air Force'd out
With a new white T, you fresh
Nothing phoney with us
Make the money, get the mansion, bring it home Swizz
[Jennifer Lopez]
From In Living Color to movie scripts
To On The Six , to J Lo to this headline clips
I stay grounded
As the amounts roll in
I'm real I thought I told you (I'm real)
I'm real even on Oprah (I'm real)
That's just me
Nothing phoney, don't hate on me
What you get is what you see, oh
Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the block
Used to have a little, now I have a lot
No matter where I go
I know where I came from
Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the block
Used to have a little, now I have a lot
No matter where I go
I know where I came from
[50 Cent]
It's everyday I go out and say hey 
to the people all around me, but then 
I see someone lookin' back at me, and I think...
it's JFTB.
[Jennifer Lopez]
Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the block
Used to have a little, now I have a lot
No matter where I go
I know where I came from
I'm down to earth like this
Rockin' this business
I've grown up so much
I'm in control and lovin' it
Rumors got me laughing kid
I love my life and my public
Put God first and can't forget to stay real
To me its like breathing, yeah
Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the block
Used to have a little, now I have a lot
No matter where I go
I know where I came from
Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the block
Used to have a little, now I have a lot
No matter where I go
I know where I came from
[Styles &amp; Jadakiss]
Yo, yo
It take hard work to cash checks
So don't be fooled by the rocks that I got, the assets
You get back what you put out
And even if you take the good route
You can't count the hood out
After a while you'll know who to blend with
Just keep it real with the ones you came in with
Best thing to do is stay low
The blocks and J Lo
They act like they don't - but they know
They can't get a penny from the block (Every one's got to make a living)
And at the end of the day
She's still Jenny from the block, yeah
[50 Cent]
Hey girl, whatcha doin girl
I got five-hundred dollars, let's go girl
c'mom c'mon
just you and me
Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the block
Used to have a little, now I have a lot
No matter where I go
I know where I came from
Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the block
Used to have a little, now I have a lot
No matter where I go
I know where I came from  
(From The Bronx)
[50 Cent &amp; Styles]
Yeah!
