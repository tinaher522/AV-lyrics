<song artist="Jennifer_Lopez" title="I,_Love">
I, love
Boy, I love you so
I, love
You and I have been around
Each other for quite a while
But I don't think that you understand
The way that I feel for you
Baby, it took a while for me
To realize that you were so naive
Or maybe you are blind and cannot see
The feelings I have for you, you don't understand
The things that I've gone through
To paint a perfect picture just for you
I even told your friends, but that won't do
Baby, you have to know, I can't wait no more
I
Love you more than you will ever know
Love
I've been trying so hard to show you
I
Love you like a queen would love her king
Love
Baby, I've been trying to show you
Look at me
Try to understand that I am here for you
And whatever you're going through
No matter what you ask me to do I will do
See baby, I'm trying to make you see
This is not pretend or make believe
I wanna be the woman that you need
Just let me get close to you, take me in your heart
Every day I want you more and more
Never in my life was I so sure
The feelings that I have, I can't ignore
So baby, just let me know
All I'm trying to say is
I
Love you more than I can love myself
Love
I would die before I hurt you
I
Love you like a woman loves a man
Love
When there's no one else to live for
Baby, for so long
I've always tried to show
You just how much I care for you
Boy, you had to know
That I could never let you go
I'll spend the rest of my life
Trying to make you understand that
I
Love you when there's no more love to give
Love
Baby, I will always want you
I
Love you when you're up against it all
Love
I'll be by your side forever
I
I love you, baby
Love you, baby
Love
Love you, baby
Love you, baby
I
Love you, baby
Love you, baby
Love
I love you, baby
Love you, baby
You
