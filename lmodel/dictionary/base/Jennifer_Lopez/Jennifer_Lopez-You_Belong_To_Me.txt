<song artist="Jennifer_Lopez" title="You_Belong_To_Me">
Why'd you tell me this
Were you looking for my reaction
What do you need to know.
Don't you know I'll alwyas be your girl
You don't have to prove to me you're beautiful to strangers
I've got loving eyes of my own.
You belong to me
Tell her- Tell her you were fooling With me
You don't even know her
Tell her that I love you
You belong to me.
You belong to me
Can it be, honey, that you're not sure
You belong to me
Thought we'd closed the book and locked the door
You don't have to prove to me that your beautiful to strangers
I've got loving eyes of my own (of my own)
And I can tell- I can tell darling
Tell her- Tell her that I love you
You belong, you belong, you belong to me
Tell her you were fooling
Tell her she don't even know
Tell her- Tell her you were fooling
I know you from a long time ago baby
Don't make me go to her house
You belong, you belong, you belong to me
