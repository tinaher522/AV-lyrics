<song artist="Jennifer_Lopez" title="Charge_Me_Up">
Running out of juice
It's a matter of seconds now
I'm shutting down
Desperate when I mo-ove
My battery is screaming loud
I'm shutting down
It's an addiction
I-I-I want more, more, more
Give me some boom, boom, boom
Give me some oh, oh, oh
Keeps up my engine with a hundred thousand volts
Ignite the room, room, room
I'm going loco, loco, loco
Struck me down like lightning bolts
Take control of my body, every single bone
I come alive when you charge me up baby
Charge me up baby, charge me up once and again
I'm dancing in the danger zone
So wired up but I just want another dose
I come alive when you charge me up baby
Charge me up baby, charge me up once and again
Ohhhh ohhhh ohhh charge me up once and again
Ohhhh ohhhh ohhhh charge me up once and again
This is my disease, my predatory instinct call
I'm 'bout to fall oh, oh, oh
Shock me, fill me up
Proceed, I'll give you all you want, I'm 'bout to fall
It's an addiction
I-I-I want more, more, more
Give me some boom, boom, boom
Give me some oh, oh, oh
Keeps up my engine with a hundred thousand volts
Ignite the room, room, room, I'm going loco, loco, loco
Struck me down like lightning bolts
Take control of my body, every single bone
I come alive when you charge me up baby
Charge me up baby, charge me up once and again
I'm dancing in the danger zone
So wired up but I just want another dose
I come alive when you charge me up baby
Charge me up baby, charge me up once and again
Ohhhh ohhhh ohhh charge me up once and again
Ohhhh ohhhh ohhhh charge me up once and again
Running real low
I'm moving in slow mo
Charge me up, shift me up, I need a reload
Running real low
I'm moving in slow mo
Charge me up, shift me up, I need a reload
Struck me down like lightning bolts
Take control of my body, every single bone
I come alive when you charge me up baby
Charge me up baby, charge me up once and again
I'm dancing in the danger zone
So wired up but I just want another dose
I come alive when you charge me up baby
Charge me up baby, charge me up once and again
Ohhhh ohhhh ohhh charge me up once and again
Ohhhh ohhhh ohhhh charge me up once and again
