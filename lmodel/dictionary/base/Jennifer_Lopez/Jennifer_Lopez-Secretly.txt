<song artist="Jennifer_Lopez" title="Secretly">
Spoken:
It's like I'm lost
I dunno?
This feeling, that I have about you
Will you ever know?
Secretly I'm wanting you
And I'm hoping you want me too
I smell your scent across the room
And I can't wait to get next to you
Whatever I see...
Whatever I hear...
Whatever I do...
Oh baby, has got me thinking of you
Secretly, I'm wanting you
And I'm hoping you want me too
I smell your scent across the room
And I can't wait to get next to you
Whenever you speak...
Whenever you move...
Whenever you breathe...
Baby, let me touch you
Secretly, I'm wanting you
And I'm hoping you want me too
I smell your scent across the room
And I can't wait to get next to you
Secretly, I'm wanting you
And I'm hoping you want me too
I smell your scent across the room
And I can't wait to get next to you
(You smell so good)
(I just wanna...kiss you)
(I wanna...lay with you)
(I dunno how to tell you)
