<song artist="Jennifer_Lopez" title="Run_The_World">
We got it locked. They know that
Whenever we around it goes down like Draino
And it's nothing to spend these pesos
And you will never see us ... low low
... Ain't nothing greater
Hanging out the window straight busting at you love haters
Bonnie Clyde,
No other girl will ever ride like I ride
That's why you need me on your passenger side
Let me help you get that paper
Hanging out the window busting at them love haters
Me and you
I'm the closest you'll ever be to truth
There's never a question of what I'll do
Uh-huh for you
With me you'll never lose
So, call on your girl that can hold you right
I'll be your protector I'll never forget you
You need somebody that can hold you tight
I'll be in your arm love
Keep you out of harm boy
I'll be your anything, everything
Rock 'n' roll with you
If things get too hot out in the cold with you
Froze, froze with you
Me and you together
Our love could run the world (uh, oh) (uh, oh)
Run the world (uh, oh) (uh, oh)
Our love could run the world (uh, oh) (uh, oh)
Run the world (uh, oh) (uh, oh)
Our love could run the world
I'll be your anything, everything, rock 'n' roll with you
If things get too hot I'm in the cold with you
Froze, froze with you
Me and you together our love could run the world
(Rose! Yeah)
The Range Rover sitting lower than the [?]
Let me know who make it rain more
Me or the Lord
I gotta schedule like I'm unemployed
Shaking dice at the table baby go ahead and blow it
You can't ignore it your whole body getting explored
Top to bottom I'm reproducing your deepest thoughts
Lay off the leash the second week I lease the Porsche
Let down the top and hit the beach a future divorce
Call on your girl that can hold you right
I'll be your protector I'll never forget ya
You need somebody that can hold you tight
I'll be in your arm love
Keep you out of harm boy
I'll be your anything, everything
Rock 'n' roll with you
If things get too hot I'm in the cold with you
Froze, froze with you
Me and you together
Our love could run the world run the world  (uh, oh) (uh, oh) 
Run the world (uh, oh) (uh, oh)
Our love could run the world (uh, oh) (uh, oh)
Run the world (uh, oh) (uh, oh)
Our love could run the world
I'll be your anything, everything, rock 'n' roll with you
If things get too hot out in the cold with you,
Froze, froze with you
Me and you together, our love could run the world
Hit me on my cell better be talking them dollars
The boss ball park resemble the dodgers
I never dodge a thing except for the Chargers
Embarrassed by the rubber bands
My ex would've charged it
Got it popping so everybody be watching them
Exotic watches you know my lady be popping them
Her girlfriends party like Cyndi Lauper now
Rose! Time to lock her down
Call on your girl that can hold you right
I'll be your protector I'll never forget ya
You need somebody that can hold you tight
I'll be in your arm love
Keep you out of harm boy
I'll be your anything, everything
Rock 'n' roll with you
If things get too hot out in the cold with you
Froze, froze with you
Me and you together 
Our love could run the world run the world (uh, oh) (uh, oh) 
Run the world (uh, oh) (uh, oh)
Our love could run the world (uh, oh) (uh, oh)
Run the world (uh, oh) (uh, oh)
Our love could run the world
I'll be your anything, everything, rock 'n' roll with you
If things get too hot out in the cold with you
Froze, froze with you
Me and you together
Our love could run the world
