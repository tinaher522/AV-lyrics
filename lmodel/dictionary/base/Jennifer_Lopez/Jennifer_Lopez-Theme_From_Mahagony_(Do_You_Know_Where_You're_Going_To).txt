<song artist="Jennifer_Lopez" title="Theme_From_Mahagony_(Do_You_Know_Where_You're_Going_To)">
Do you know where you're going to
Do you like the things that life's been showing you
Where are you going to
Do you know?
Do you gain what you're hoping for
When you look behind you there's no open door
What are you hoping for
Do you know?
Once we where standing still in time
Chasing the fantasy's that filled our mind
You knew how I loved you but my spirit was free
Laughing at the questions that you once asked of me
Do you know where you're going to
Do you like the things that life's been showing you
Where are you going to
Do you know?
Now lookin' back on all we planned
We let so many dreams just slip through our hands
Why must we wait so long before we see
How sad the answers to our those questions can be
Do you know where you're going to
Do you like the things that life's been showing you
Where are you going to
Do you know?
Do you gain what you're hoping for
When you look behind you there's no open door
What are you hoping for
Do you know?
Do you know?
