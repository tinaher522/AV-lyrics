<song artist="Jennifer_Lopez" title="I_Got_U">
Sometimes real love can be 
Not seen 'cause you're thinking
What's right in front of you
Can't be the one for you
Then one day you realize that
There are feelings that you can't hold back
And you're so caught up now that's all you think of
Crazy how...
All that talk of us not able to last
Just because of mistakes we made in the past
But they failed to understand
I got you
And nobody can come and change a thing
'Cause you gotta know 
You got me
And it feels so good to have you back now
I'm so proud
I got you
And if somebody tries to take you from me
They will see
I got you
You got me
I got you
Things are often said to
Doubt what I feel for you
But words that people say
Won't take my love away
Although it hurts sometimes, it's alright
But why they say some things? That ain't right
I never know but please understand that
Baby, it ain't nothing
All that talk of us not able to last
Just because of mistakes we made in the past
But they failed to understand
I got you
And nobody can come and change a thing
'Cause you gotta know 
You got me
And it feels so good to have you back now
I'm so proud
I got you
And if somebody tries to take you from me
They will see
I got you
You got me
I got you
You got me
Talk is all that people can do
Nevermind all that love, all that you've
Gotta do is simply love, trust
And just stay focused on us
Together we'll get through whatever
If we don't let speculations mix situations up
We'll be alright
I got you
And nobody can come and change a thing
'Cause you gotta know 
You got me
And it feels so good to have you back now
I'm so proud
I got you
And if somebody tries to take you from me
They will see
I got you
You got me
I got you
And nobody can come and change a thing
'Cause you gotta know 
You got me
And it feels so good to have you back now
I'm so proud
I got you
And if somebody tries to take you from me
They will see
I got you
You got me
I got you
You got me
I got you
You got me
I got you
You got me
I got you
You got me
I got you
You got me
I got you
