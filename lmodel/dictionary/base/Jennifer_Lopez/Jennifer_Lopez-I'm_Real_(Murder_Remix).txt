Murder Inc.
What's my motherfuckin' name?
R-U-L-E
Blowin' back on this Mary Jane I'm analyzing the game.
And the game done chose me
To bring pain to pussy niggas and pussy hoes they one and the same
Ever since you told me
There's only room for two, I been making less room for you.
Now only God can hold me
Hug me, love me, judge me, the only man that hovers above me... holla!
I met so many men,  
It's like they're all the same.
My appetite for lovin'
Is now my hunger pain!
And when I'm feeling sexy
Who's gonna come for me?
My only problem is,
Their insecurity.
Are you tired of bein' alone? (Yeah yeah)
Sick of arguin' on the phone. (Yeah yeah)
Why you telling all ya friends? (Yeah yeah)
But your nigga don't undastand... my love.
(Chorus)
Cuz I'm real.
The way you walk
The way you move
The way you talk.
Cuz I'm real.
The way you stare
The way you look
Your style, your hair.
Cuz I'm real.
The way you smile
The way you smell
It drives me wild.
Cuz I'm real.
And I can't go on without you.
I've been thinking 'bout the re-lation-ship
And I wanna know is this as good as it gets?
Cuz we been through the worst times and the best times
But it was our time even if it was part-time.
Now they been looking at me smiling at me
Laughing like we wasn't happy
But not knowing that we growin' and we gettin' married
Hard lovin', straight thuggin'
Bitch, I ain't doing this shit for nothin'.
I'm here to get it poppin' and hoppin'
Let's ride out in the Benz, hair blowing in the wind,
Sun glistening off my skin.
Hey! I'm nasty heh, you know me, but you still gonna fuck witcha baby...
Cuz I'm real.
The way you walk
The way you move
The way you talk.
Cuz I'm real.
The way you stare
The way you look
Your style, your hair.
Cuz I'm real.
The way you smile
The way you smell
It drives me wild.
Cuz I'm real.
And I can't go on without you.
Now people lovin' me and hatin' me, treatin' me ungreatfully,
But not knowin' that they ain't makin' or breakin' me
My life, I live it to the limit and I love it
Now I can breathe again baby now I can breathe again
Now people screaming "What the deal with you and so-and-so?"
I tell 'em "Niggas mind their biz" but they don't hear me, though
Cuz I live life to the limit and I love it
Now I can breathe again, baby now I can breathe again
Are you tired of being alone? (Yeah yeah)
Sick of arguin' on the phone? (Yeah yeah)
Why you telling all ya friends? (Yeah yeah)
But your nigga don't understand... my love.
Cuz I'm real.
The way you walk
The way you move
The way you talk.
Cuz I'm real.
The way you stare
The way you look
Your style, your hair.
Cuz I'm real.
The way you smile
The way you smell
It drives me wild.
Cuz I'm real.
And I can't go on without you.
Cuz I'm real.
The way you walk
The way you move
The way you talk.
Cuz I'm real.
The way you stare
The way you look
Your style, your hair.
Cuz I'm real.
The way you smile
The way you smell
It drives me wild.
Cuz I'm real.
And I can't go on without you.
