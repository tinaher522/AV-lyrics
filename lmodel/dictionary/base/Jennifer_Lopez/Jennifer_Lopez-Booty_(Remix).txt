Big, big booty
What you got a big booty
Big, big booty
What you got a big booty
Big, big booty
What you got a big booty
Big, big booty
What you
(Ain't that a freak)
Jennifer Lopez:
Have you seen her on the dance floor
She got the boom, shake the room
That's the lightning and the thunder
You wanna meet her, you wanna touch her
See the light in her eyes, and it starts to make you wonder
All the sexy girls in the party
Go and grab a man, bring him to the dance floor
Go on let them jeans touch you while you're dancing
It's his birthday, give him what he ask for
(Let me show you how to do it)
Big, big booty
What you got a big booty
(Work)
Big, big booty
What you got a big booty
(Shake that)
Big, big booty
What you got a big booty
(Go to work)
Big, big booty
What you
The way she moves
I know you want her
She like the fire, get you right
That's the lightning and the thunder
You wanna meet her, you gotta touch her
Hold on tight for the ride
'Cause you know you wanna love her
All the sexy girls in the party
Go and grab a man, bring him to the dance floor
Go on let them jeans touch you while you're dancing
It's his birthday, give him what he ask for
(Let me show you how to do it)
Big, big booty
What you got a big booty
(Work)
Big, big booty
What you got a big booty
(Shake that)
Big, big booty
What you got a big booty
(Go to work)
Big, big booty
What you
Iggy Azalea:
They begging me to drop down
On the floor right now
Iggy on the top
The last time the world's seen a booty this good
It was on Jenny from the Block
I got 'em all crazy lately
But baby, all the men on my magnet
Wanna tell all of my ladies
To get up on the floor
And just shake it, shake it
Y'all know where I been on
Y'all know where I been on
Queen Booty Iggy
Now find me a bone to sit on
Girls with those cheeks, put they hands in the air
And pop that, pop
Let 'em know that you're in here
See everybody wanna get a taste
You know that we got enough to share
But fact we girls with the big fat booty
Too fancy to ever play fair
Jennifer Lopez:
Mesmerized by the size of it
You can't fight it
If you like, take your turn
I can guarantee you'll have the time of your life
Throw up your hands if you love a big booty
Big big big big big big booty
What you...
Big big big big big big booty
What you...
Big big big big big big
Let me show you how to do it
Work
Shake that
Go to work
Big, big booty
What you got a big booty
Big, big booty
What you got a big booty
Big, big booty
What you got a big booty
Big, big booty
What you got a big booty
Shake that
