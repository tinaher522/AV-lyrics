AHEM!
Hi, I'm Tune.
The man on the moon.
I live on the beach.
Get the sand out your shoes.
And all of that changed since I met you.
So we could leave that old shit in the restroom.
Young Money!
You got me and I could not defend it.
I tried, but I had to surrender.
Your star got me under the spellbound.
Left me no other choice, but to get down.
It's too late. (Lil Wayne: It's too late.) It's too late. (It's too late.)
It's too late. (Uh!) It's too late. (Tell 'em.)
You got it. (You got it.) You got it. (You got it.)
You got it. (You got it.) You got it. (Uh!)
When I look into your eyes, it's over.
You got me hooked with your love controller. (Lil Wayne: Yeah!)
I'm tripping and I could not get over.
I feel lucky like a four-leaf clover.
'Cause I'm into you. I'm into you.
I'm into you. Yeah! (C'mon!)
I'm into you. (I'm into you.) I'm into you. (I'm into you.)
I'm into you. Yeah! (Uh!)
Listen. Now I'm strong. Baby, I bring the fire on.
Sharp shooter. You can call me the zion.
I'm not the one easy to get to,
But all that changed, baby, when I met you.
It's too late. (Lil Wayne: It's too late.) It's too late. (It's too late.)
It's too late. (It's too late.) It's too late. (C'mon.)
You got it. (You got it.) You got it. (You got it.)
You got it. (You got it.) You got it. (Yeah!)
When I look into your eyes, it's over.
You got me hooked with your love controller.
I'm tripping and I could not get over.
I feel lucky like a four-leaf clover. (Lil Wayne: Why?!)
'Cause I'm into you. (I'm into you.)
I'm into you. (I'm into you.) I'm into you. Yeah!
I'm into you. (I'm into you.) I'm into you.
I'm into you. Yeah!
Okay. Now I'm into you like you never knew.
I'm falling for you, baby. I need a parachute.
So wet, I need a wet suit.
You're way too fly, I could be your jet fuel.
Now tell me what you like. I like what you tell me.
And if you understand me, then you can overwhelm me.
It's too late. It's too late.
Every finish line is the beginning of a new race. HA!
When I look into your eyes, (When I look into your eyes!) it's over.
You got me hooked (Baby!) with your love controller. (I know!)
I'm tripping and I could not get over.
I feel lucky like a four-leaf clover. (Lil Wayne: C'mon.)
'Cause I'm into you. (Jennifer Lopez: I'm into you!) I'm into you. (I'm into you!) I'm into you. (I'm into you, baby! Yeah!) Yeah!
I'm into you. (I'm into you!) I'm into you. (I'm into you!)
I'm into you. Yeah! (Lil Wayne: Yeah!)
'Cause I'm into you. (Jennifer Lopez: I'm into you!)
I'm into you. (I'm into you!) I'm into you. (I'm into you!)
Yeah! (Baby! Yeah!) I'm into you. (I'm into you!)
I'm into you. (I'm into you!) I'm into you. Yeah!
