<song artist="Jennifer_Lopez" title="Step_Into_My_World">
Step into my world...
Like a moth to a flame, you know you're drawn to me
I know you better than you know yourself, baby
Why do you try to resist what you want, honey
I want you to give me what I need - listen closely
I need you to hold on me
I need you to kiss on me
Feel your body next to me
I want you to, I need you to
Want you to give into me
Want all of you, everything
Ecstasy's what I will bring
You, if you just
Step into my world 
Where there's countless things to see
Endless possibilities
Let me take you to a place
Where desires flow deep
See an odyssey of dreams
And the best of fantasies
All this for your eyes only 
Ooh, step into my world
Close your eyes, and let your feelings now take over
It's alright, I'm intoxicating you though you're sober
You inside, the thought alone is so overbearing
Boy tonight, you just follow my lead from here in
I need you to hold on me
I need you to kiss on me
Feel your body next to me
I want you to, I need you to
Want you to give into me
Want all of you, everything
Ecstasy's what I will bring
You, if you just
Step into my world 
Where there's countless things to see
Endless possibilities
Let me take you to a place
Where desires flow deep
See an odyssey of dreams
And the best of fantasies
All this for your eyes only 
Ooh, step into my world
Where there's no reality
Time itself means nothing
It's so hypnotizing
It brings you to a state of natural high
See how my words, they get to you
Creates the lift that's haunting you
Yes, that's it, hold onto it
Ooh, welcome to my world
My world
Where desires flow deep
Fantasies
Ooh, step into my world 
Where there's countless things to see
Endless possibilities
Let me take you to a place
Where desires flow deep
See an odyssey of dreams
And the best of fantasies
All this for your eyes only 
Ooh, step into my world
