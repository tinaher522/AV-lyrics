<song artist="Jennifer_Lopez" title="Hypnotico">
All the girls that know that they're sexy
Come on
Don't sit now, it's gonna get nasty
Hypnoti-notico, hypnoti-notico
Shake me, shake those earthquakes, 'cause I'm in the city
Hypnoti-notico, hypnoti-notico
They all want me for my body
I'm original sexy
Hypnoti-notico, hypnoti-notico
All the boys all love it when we do our thing
We're just some silly heartbreakers tonight (tonight)
All the boys all want it, but it don't mean a thing
We got tonight (tonight)
We're just some silly heartbreakers tonight
All the boys all love it when we do our thing
We're just some silly heartbreakers tonight (tonight)
All the boys all want it, but it don't mean a thing
We got tonight (tonight)
We're just some silly heartbreakers tonight
Hypnoti-notico, hypnoti-notico
Red eyes widen
Envious smiles
Hypnoti-notico, hypnoti-notico
Sunburn, baby, hurts like cra-azy
Hypnoti-notico, hypnoti-notico
Hungry for some yum, yum
Gonna get me some, some
Hypnoti-notico, hypnoti-notico
All the boys all love it when we do our thing
We're just some silly heartbreakers tonight (tonight)
All the boys all want it, but it don't mean a thing
We got tonight (tonight)
We're just some silly heartbreakers tonight
All the boys all love it when we do our thing
We're just some silly heartbreakers tonight (tonight)
All the boys all want it, but it don't mean a thing
We got tonight (tonight)
We're just some silly heartbreakers tonight
Aah
Hypnoti-notico, hypnoti-notico
Aah
Hypnoti-notico, hypnoti-notico
All the boys go crazy
All the boys go crazy
Hypnoti-notico, hypnoti-notico
Wind up your body like you're a Boricua
All of the men have a silly heartbreaker
Hypnoti-notico, hypnoti-notico
All the boys all love it when we do our thing
We're just some silly heartbreakers tonight (tonight)
All the boys all want it, but it don't mean a thing
We got tonight (tonight)
We're just some silly heartbreakers tonight
All the boys all love it when we do our thing
We're just some silly heartbreakers tonight (tonight)
All the boys all want it, but it don't mean a thing
We got tonight (tonight)
We're just some silly heartbreakers tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight
All the boys all want it, but it don't mean a thing
We got tonight (tonight)
We're just some silly heartbreakers tonight (night-night-night)
Hypnoti-notico, hypnoti-notico
