<song artist="Jennifer_Lopez" title="Worry_No_More">
Do anything that you can to make me feel so protected
I don't wanna worry no more
I'd give anything for you to come and help me perfect it
I don't worry no more
I don't worry no more
I won't worry
Wanna feel like I'm brand new
Even though I gotta have you
All them other bitches stab you
They was close enough to grab you
Ain't no other way they had to
I'm a always hold it down for ya
Look at how I move around for ya
Do anything that you can, to make me feel so protected
I don't wanna worry no more
Just want you to know my name by the time we exit
Wanna feel like I'm brand new
Even though I gotta have you
All them other bitches stab you
They was close enough to grab you
I won't worry no more
The feeling that you give me is a coke rush
Addicted to fans and money, white Lamborghini
My name ring bells, authorities wanna see me
Born king, that's why she was Nefertiti
Never been too easy try to stay up out of debt
IRS is watching me, they follow what's on my neck
Still onto me but I'm always coming correct
Cause all these jewels my niggas wanna collect
We the biggest in the game so bitches give us respect
Dance like a star, ass shake like a car
She really something special I can tell from afar
Eyes on the check, 8-figures feel the best
Hustle on the corners, before she be the finesse
Ex-drug dealer but still got his connects, yes
Do anything that you can, to make me feel so protected
I don't wanna worry no more
Just want you to know my name by the time we exit
Wanna feel like I'm brand new
Even though I gotta have you
All them other bitches stab you
They was close enough to grab you
I won't worry no more
I'm a always hold it down for ya
Move around for ya
I don't worry no more
I won't worry
I don't worry no more
Hold it down for ya
I'm a move around for ya
I don't wanna worry no more
Hold it down for ya
Every time I come around for ya
I'm a always hold it down for ya
Look at how I move around for ya
Do anything that you can, to make me feel so protected
I won't worry
I don't wanna worry no more
How I move around for ya
How I move around for ya
How I move around for ya
How I move around for ya
How I move around for ya
