<song artist="Jennifer_Lopez" title="Get_Right_(Remix)">
Guess who
J to the Lo
F to the A-B
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah
I ain't Mr. Right, I'm Mr. Right Now
I keep women in thongs comin' along
Invisibly set stones, some of them prone
I can tell you ain't never had someone this long
One night, have them hummin' my song
Like, "mmm, mmm, mmm," girl
You ain't know I was comin' this strong
Now you know not to come at me wrong
I get right, uh
You're looking just a little too hard at me
Standing just a little too close to me
You're saying not quite enough to me
You're sipping just a little too slow for me
No doubt, you play it real cool homie
Got me thinking what is it you do for me
Trippin', a little more than I should be
So let yourself go and get right with me
I'm about to sign you up, we can get right
Before the night is up, we can get right
We can get right, we can get right
I'm about to fill your cup so we can get right
Before the night is up, we can get right tonight
We can get right
In my heart, in my heart
In my heart, in my heart
Your lips, talking about I play too much
Can't a woman take advantage of what she wants
My hips moving oh so slow
Bar tab looking like a car note
All I need is you here right by my side
Take whatever you want, baby let's ride
And whatever you won't do, let me decide
Just put your name on the dotted line
I'm about to sign you up, we can get right
Before the night is up, we can get right
We can get right, we can get right
I'm about to fill your cup so we can get right
Before the night is up, we can get right tonight
We can get right
So much we got to say
But so little time
And if tonight ain't long enough
Don't leave love behind
(Don't leave this love behind)
Baby, take my hand
I'll show you why
I'm about to sign you up, we can get right
Before the night is up, we can get right
We can get right, we can get right
I'm about to fill your cup so we can get right
Before the night is up, we can get right tonight
We can get right
It's slim with the tilted rim on twenty inch rims
Rocked up wrist watch, six inch Timbs
Button-up shirt cuffed with the French trim
So you can tell a man get to the right
I'm in the driver's seat, you sit to the right
And this is just to get to the flight
I like the way it fit to you tight
So I'mma show you the world in a day
Before it even get to the night
I'm lookin' for a dime, but I don't need a penny though
Or any old wannabe Jenny-Lo, no
Plenty dough and there's plenty more where it come from
I'm the real talk where I come from
I'm about to sign you up, we can get right
Before the night is up, we can get right
We can get right, we can get right
I'm about to fill your cup so we can get right
Before the night is up, we can get right tonight
We can get right
I'm about to sign you up, we can get right
Before the night is up, we can get right
We can get right, we can get right
I'm about to fill your cup so we can get right
Before the night is up, we can get right tonight
We can get right
