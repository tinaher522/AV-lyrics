<song artist="Jennifer_Lopez" title="Frozen_Moments">
Love has done a number on my mind 
Though I sit and wonder I don't ask why 
Some decisions I've made haven't altogether been mine 
Now I don't feel a thing, I feel ok 
No I'm not bitter, I'm not cold 
I'm just frozen for a moment 
My vision is impaired, My heart is under repair 
What can I say about love 
I know what it means to have too little and too much 
Crowding my thoughts 
What I really want is to not think about it at all 
Life is never easy when you need it to be 
Desire can deceive you 
Its better to daydream 
Somewhere deep down inside 
I knew it wasn't the right thing 
But I didn't want to be wrong 
That's a chance you take 
No I'm not bitter, I'm not cold 
I'm just frozen for a moment 
My vision is impaired, My heart is under repair 
What can I say about love 
I know what it means to have too little and too much 
Crowding my thoughts 
What I really want is to not think about it at all 
What can I say about love 
I know what it means to have too little and too much 
Crowding my thoughts 
What I really want is to not think about it at all
