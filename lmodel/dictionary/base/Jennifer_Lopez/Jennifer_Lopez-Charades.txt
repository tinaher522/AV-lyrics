<song artist="Jennifer_Lopez" title="Charades">
Break and you buy it
Nothing's for free
Especially my body
Especially me
Break and you bought it
I pray that you don't
Don't do what all guys do
Do what all guys do
Just forgetting to be social
When you turn to dishonest
Think that running the streets worthy
That just turns months into weeks into days
I wanna be cordial
I'm just speaking your conscience
You want to take it but I won't give it away
Leave me and I'll miss I never made
Try to play a game I never learned
No one ever wins at love charade
You think that you're the only that ever say
You love me when it's over
Break and you buy it
This one is on me
Don't start away
Don't cause a scene
Start up a fire
Pray that you don't
Don't do what all guys do
Do what all guys do
Just forgetting to be social
When you turn to dishonest
Think that running the streets worthy
That just turns months into weeks into days
I wanna be cordial
I'm just speaking your conscience
You want to take it but I won't give it away
Leave me and I'll miss I never made
Try to play a game I never learned
No one ever wins at love charade
You think that you're the only that ever say
You love me when it's over
You shoulda took your time
Did it right when you had me baby
You shoulda took your time
Shoulda took your time
You shoulda took your time
Did it right when you had me baby
She was playing games all those love charades
You want to take it but I won't give it away
Leave me and I'll miss I never made
Try to play a game I never learned
No one ever wins at love charade
You think that you're the only that ever say
You love me when it's over
