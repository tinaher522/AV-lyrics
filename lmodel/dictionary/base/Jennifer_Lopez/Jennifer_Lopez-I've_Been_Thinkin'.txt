<song artist="Jennifer_Lopez" title="I've_Been_Thinkin'">
All I need is a place to be
And a way to feel
A space to figure out where I belong
A chance to know my thoughts
And find a way to show
What I feel
And if this is real, yeah
Don't wanna disappoint you
Don't wanna let you down
'Cause that's the last thing I would do
I'm asking for your patience
I realize I could lose you
But lately I've been so confused
I've been thinkin' ( thinkin' )
You've been on my mind ( on my mind )
So I've been praying ( praying) 
To find a way that I ( a way that I )
Can be sure, the way that ( the way that )
You've been sure with me ( sure with me )
Don't you want that for me
Wondering endlessly if this is right or wrong
Or if it's just about me all along
All I need is time to search within my soul
So I can share a deeper part of me, yeah
Don't wanna disappoint you
Don't wanna let you down
'Cause that's the last thing I would do
I'm asking for you patience
I realize I could lose you
But lately I've been so confused
I've been thinkin' ( thinkin' )
You've been on my mind ( on my mind )
So I've been praying ( praying )
To find a way that I ( a way that I )
Can be sure, the way that ( the way that )
You've been sure with me ( sure with me )
Don't you want that for me
Baby, what's meant to be ( what was meant to be )
Will surely be ( will surely be, baby )
( if you love me baby you would understand )
But I can't give you anything ( can't give you anything )
I don't have myself to give ( don't have myself to give )
And it's killing me inside
