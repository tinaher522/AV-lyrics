<song artist="Jennifer_Lopez" title="Feelin'_So_Good_-_Featuring_Big_Pun-Fat_Joe,_Album_Version">
When I opened up my eyes today
Felt the sun shining on my face
It became so clear to me
That everything is going my way
I feel like there's no limit to what I can see
Got rid of fears that were holding me
My endless possibilities
Has the whole world opened for me
That's why I'm feeling
I'm feeling so good
I knew that I would
Been taking care of myself
Like I should, 'cause not one thing
Can bring me down
Nothing in this world's
Gonna turn me around
Now the day is turning into night
And everything is still going right
There's no way you can stop me this time
Or break this spirit of mine, oh no
Like the stars above I'm gonna shine
Anything I want will be mine
Tonight I'm gonna have a good time
Call a few friends of mine
'Cause I'm loving life
And tonight's for feeling
I'm feeling so good
I knew that I would
Been taking care of myself
Like I should, 'cause not one thing
Can bring me down
Nothing in this world's
Gonna turn me around
I'm feeling so good
I knew that I would
Been taking care of myself
Like I should, 'cause not one thing
Can bring me down
Nothing in this world's
Gonna turn me around
When I opened up my eyes today
Felt the sun shining on my face
It became so clear to me
That everything is going my way
I feel like there's no limit to what I can see
Got rid of fears that were holding me
My endless possibilities
Has the whole world opened for me
That's why I'm feeling
I'm feeling so good
I knew that I would
Been taking care of myself
Like I should, 'cause not one thing
Can bring me down
Nothing in this world's
Gonna turn me around
I'm feeling so good
I knew that I would
Been taking care of myself
Like I should, 'cause not one thing
Can bring me down
Nothing in this world's
Gonna turn me around
I'm feelin' so
Party on tonight
Everything is feelin' right, DJ
Party on tonight
Everything is feelin' right
I'm feeling so good
I knew that I would
Been taking care of myself
Like I should, 'cause not one thing
Can bring me down
Nothing in this world's
Gonna turn me around
I'm feeling so good
I knew that I would
Been taking care of myself
Like I should, 'cause not one thing
Can bring me down
Nothing in this world's
Gonna turn me around
I'm feeling so good
I knew that I would
Been taking care of myself
Like I should, 'cause not one thing
Can bring me down
Nothing in this world's
Gonna turn me around
I'm feeling so good
I knew that I would
Been taking care of myself
Like I should, 'cause not one thing
Can bring me down
Nothing in this world's
Gonna turn me around
