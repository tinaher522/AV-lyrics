<song artist="Jennifer_Lopez" title="We_Gotta_Talk">
Ooh baby, come and talk to me
Together we can work this out
We gotta love thing we're talking about
The way you looked at me
Tells me you're sorry
You walked by me
whispering you love me
When I tried to hold you tight
you pulled away
But you wanted me to stay
Instead you ran away
Baby, talk to me
Let's stop playing games
Don't turn away from me
Just look me straight in the eyes
Don't try to sweet talk me
With those nasty words you say
Baby, just be real and tell me how you feel, baby
Ooh baby, come and talk to me
Together we can work this out
We gotta love thing we're talking about
The way you tricked me
You know that wasn't right, ooh
You tried to fix it
But all we did was fight
Because I gave you everything I had to give
If you know it's worth the fight
We gotta compromise
Baby, talk to me
And tell me what's wrong
Come sit down next to me
And let me feel the vibe you're on
Come lay your head on me
And everything will be alright
But we must communicate
Tomorrow it could be too late
Ooh baby, come and talk to me
Together we can work this out
We gotta love thing we're talking about
Cause I love you boy
And I need you here
Together we can make this thing work out
To think about what we could miss
Makes me wanna lose my mind
Talk to me
Come on, come on, come on
Talk to me, ohhhhh, ohhhhh, ha, ha
Makes me want a chance baby...
Ooh baby, come and talk to me
Together we can work this out
We gotta love thing we're talking about
