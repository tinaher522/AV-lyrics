<song artist="Jennifer_Lopez" title="Still">
(When I sleep,) I have dreams about the way we used to kiss;
'Bout the way you used to hold me and say nothin' would ever harm me...
(When we first met,) oh, how you charmed me, made me smile when I was down;
Big pimpin' around the town, (you and me) - whenever they'd see you, (they'd see me...)
A lover and a friend to me you were, how did it end?
How it hurts to not have you in my life, when I wanted to be your wife...
(You never know what you have) 'til its gone;
Treated you wrong for so long,
Now you're gone (away,) 
But the love still lives here...
I still got love for you (Still...), after all we've been through; (Still...) 
I gave my heart to you, and baby, you're the only one... (The only one...)
There's other men, then you (Still...) - they can't come close to you; (Still...) 
Once I said, "I love you," I knew you'd be the only one...
A good man you were to me, always there to care;
Would do anything in this world for me, didn't matter what, when, or where, (you were there...)
I never thought we'd part from the arguments I'd start;
When I just wanted some attention - (Sorry...) well, I'm sorry, baby, for bitchin'... 
(If I could) take back the words that I said to make you leave,
I'd be down on bended knees asking you to please forgive me...
(You never know what you have) 'til its gone;
Treated you wrong for so long,
Now you're gone (away,) 
But the love still lives here...
I still got love for you (Still...), after all we've been through; (Still...) 
I gave my heart to you, and baby, you're the only one... (The only one...)
There's other men, then you (Still...) - they can't come close to you; (Still...) 
Once I said, "I love you," I knew you'd be the only one...
All of the good times we had together (together), do they mean something to you?
Do you ever wish we never split? ('Cause I) still got love for you...
I still got love for you (Still...), after all we've been through; (Still...) 
I gave my heart to you, and baby, you're the only one... (The only one...)
There's other men, then you (Still...) - they can't come close to you; (Still...) 
Once I said, "I love you," I knew you'd be the only one...
I still got love for you (Still...), after all we've been through; (Still...) 
I gave my heart to you, and baby, you're the only one... (The only one...)
There's other men, then you (Still...) - they can't come close to you; (Still...) 
Once I said, "I love you," I knew you'd be the only one...
