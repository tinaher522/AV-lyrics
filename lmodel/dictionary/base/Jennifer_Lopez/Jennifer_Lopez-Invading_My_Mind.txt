<song artist="Jennifer_Lopez" title="Invading_My_Mind">
It's invading my mind
And breaking the ice
I can't fight it
This feeling is invading my, my mind
I'm infected tonight
I can't fight it
It's taken, invaded my, my mind
Can't decide
Can't define
What I feel inside
It's so bad, it's still good
Prefer and love?
It's a rush, it's so rough
This is out of line
It's a storm and it rock, rock, rocks my mind
My Destiny, misery
Your energy
It's invading my mind
And breaking the ice
I can't fight it
This feeling is invading my, my mind
I'm infected tonight
I can't fight it
It's taken, invaded my, my mind
My mind, my mind
This feeling's invaded my mind
My mind, my mind
It's taken, invaded my, my mind
Like a wild
Wrecking ball
Crashing block block block
I'm defenseless, it penetrates my walls
Freezing cold, steaming hot,
Sweaty drip-drip-drop
It's unstoppable, I can't shake it up
My destiny, misery
Your energy
It's invading my mind
And breaking the ice
I can't fight it
This feeling is invading my, my mind
I'm infected tonight
I can't fight it
It's taken, invaded my, my mind
My mind, my mind
This feeling's invaded my mind
My mind, my mind
It's taken, invaded my, my mind
It's taking me down
And getting me high
It brings every fantasy to life
It's getting so loud
Out here, all around
And I just can't fight
It's invading my mind
And breaking the ice
I can't fight it
This feeling is invading my, my mind
I'm infected tonight
I can't fight it
It's taken, invaded my, my mind
