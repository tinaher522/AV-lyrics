<song artist="Jennifer_Lopez" title="Im_Real_Remix">
Whats my mother f**kin name (ja-rule )
R-u-l-e (j-lo)
Blowin back on this maryjane I'm analyzin da game
And the game done chose me 
Ta bring pain ta pussy niggas n pussy hoes it all
Da same
N eva since u told me 
Its only room fa two n I been makin less room for u
Now only God can hold me
Hug me luv me judge me the man that can hold is
Above me holla 
I met so many men
Its like they're all the same
My appetite for lovin
Is now my hunger pain
N when I'm feelin sexy
Whoes gonna comfort me
My only problem
Is their insecurity
Chorus 1:
U tired of bein alone (ja-rule)
Yeah yeah (j-lo)
Keep arguin on the phone
Yeah yeah
Why u tellin all ur friends
Yeah yeah
That your nigga don't understand
My luv (together)
Chorus 2:
'cause I'm real
The way u walk the way u move the way u talk
'cause I'm real
The way u stair the way u look ur style ur hair
'cause I'm real
The way u smile the way u smell it drives me wild
'cause I'm real
And I cant go on without u,babe
(ja-rule)
Girl I been thinkin bout our (both)relationship

An I wanna know is it as(both) good as it gets
'cause we been through the worst times(both)
N the best times
But it was our times even if it was part times
Now they been lookin at me smilin at me
Laughin like we wasnt happy
But now I know that were growin n we're gettin
Married

But u still let me f**k with u baby
::repeat chorus 2::

Now people luvin me n hatin me n treatin me
Ungreatfully
But not knowing that they ain't makin a break at me
My life: I live it to the limit and I love it
Now I can breathe again
Baby now I can breathe again
Now people screamin what's the deal with u and so so
I tell them niggas mind their biz but they dont
Hear me though
'cause I live my life ta the limit and I love it
Now I can breathe again
Baby now I can breathe again
