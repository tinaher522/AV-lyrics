<song artist="Jennifer_Lopez" title="I'm_Waiting">
Mr. Lover, Mr. Lover, Mr. Lover
Uh, uh, well
Sugar
Here's another one
And another day
Move to this, let me see you jump and twist
Pump your fist 'cause you know it's hard to resist
As long you know you're rollin' with the love
specialist
Feel the pow, let me put the groove in your hips
The night is young, so let's go roll with the fun
You got some gun, check it out, gimme some
'Cause I'm about to play an old girl like a drum
She shackatack, poor soul settle down
Girl, what you gon' do with all that body
{Shake it up all night}
Careful with that thing before you hurt somebody
{Tell me what you like}
Do it, baby
How you can grant the woman access to your villa
Trespasser and a witness while you cling on your pillow
You better watch your back before she turn into a killer
Best for you and the situation not to call the beaner
To be a true player you have to know how to play
If she say you're not, convince her say you're gay
Never admit to a word when she say makes a claim
And you tell her baby no way
But she caught me on the counter
"It wasn't me"
Saw me banging on the sofa
"It wasn't me"
I even had her in the shower
"It wasn't me"
She even caught me on camera
"It wasn't me"
She saw the marks on my shoulder
"It wasn't me"
Heard the words that I told her
"It wasn't me"
Heard the screams getting louder
"It wasn't me"
She stayed until it was over
