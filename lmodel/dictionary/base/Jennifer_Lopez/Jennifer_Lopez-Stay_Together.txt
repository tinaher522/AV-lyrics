<song artist="Jennifer_Lopez" title="Stay_Together">
Through the bumpy roads, the others bite the dust 'cos
They be thinking they're in love when they're in lust, but
Cliché, breakin' up so easy
I'm about to throw a curve ball, honey
People let the stormy weather push them over
Back against the ropes, it's easy to be over
Don't sweat the little things, wake up
Stay together
It's the new break up
Everyday, I think how we done it
Every way that we can keep lovin'
Toe to toe
We so strong and on and on
We up and runnin'
Not a day goes by without dreamin'
Not a thing goes out, just keep reachin'
Through the storm we stay warm and on and on
We keep on lovin'
The stars are in our favor
This love comes second nature
Heartbreaks are overrated
Stay together
That's the new trend
Boy, we done started something serious 'cos
Romance is underrated
Stay together
That's the new trend
Through the bumpy roads, the others bite the dust and
Seems like everybody's giving up when
These days breaking up so cliché
Hear 'em screaming out, "Baby, no, please stay!"
People wanna always hurry up and wait for
Someone better than the person they won't stay for
They sweat the little things, wake up
Stay together
It's the new breakup
Everyday, I think how we done it
Every way that we can keep lovin'
Toe to toe
We so strong and on and on
We up and runnin'
Not a day goes by without dreamin'
Not a thing goes out, just keep reachin'
Through the storm we stay warm and on and on
We keep on lovin'
The stars are in our favor
This love comes second nature
Heartbreaks are overrated
Stay together
That's the new trend
Boy, we done started something serious 'cos
Romance is underrated
Stay together
That's the new trend
Hey, yeah
And though there'll be the nights of fights
And we must face it
It's like a roller coaster
Ups and downs will come
As long as we hold tight
And never act complacent
Remember how we built this
Then our love is never done
Everyday, I think how we done it
Every way that we can keep lovin'
Toe to toe
We so strong and on and on
We up and runnin'
Not a day goes by without dreamin'
Not a thing goes out just keep reachin'
Through the storm we stay warm and on and on
We keep on lovin'
The stars are in our favor
This love comes second nature
Heartbreaks are overrated
Stay together
That's the new trend
Boy, we done started something serious 'cause
Romance is underrated
Stay together
That's the new trend
