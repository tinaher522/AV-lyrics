<song artist="Jennifer_Lopez" title="Baila">
Let's break all the rules
Come on baby, me and you
Baila, come on baby, baila
Baila, come on baby, baila
Baila, come on baby, baila
Let's break all the rules
Come on baby, me and you
You took my love to a
Another level and
Boy, I'm so happy I
Didn't have to settle for
Nobody else but you
'Cause everything you do
Breaks all the rules
Baila, come on baby, baila
Let's break all the rules
Come on baby, me and you
Baila, come on baby, baila
I don't care what they say
Come on baby, dance with me
Baila, come on baby, baila
Let's break all the rules
Come on baby, me and you
Boy, you're my destiny
My final ecstasy
There is no higher place
That I could ever feel
A love so strong, so real
The way I feel with you
You break the rules
Baila, come on baby, baila
Let's break all the rules
Come on baby, me and you
Baila, come on baby, baila
I don't care what they say
Come on baby, dance with me
Baila, come on baby, baila
Baila, come on baby, baila
Baila, come on baby, baila
La la la le lo la...
(Baila, come on baby, baila)
