<song artist="Years_&_Years" title="Traps">
I was a ghost, 
I was adored by you.
I trapped an owl, 
I shot a hare for you.
Can I ignite? 
Can I burn like never before?
What you desire it's inside of me I am sure.
My intentions were good, my intentions were good.
I am the garden, I am the sea, will you lay a trap for me?
I am the garden, I am the sea, will you lay a trap for me?
I gave you words, 
I planted trees by your bed. 
You said you loved me, 
you said you'd have me instead.
Can I ignite? 
Can I burn like never before?
What you desire it's inside of me that I'm sure. 
My intentions were good. My intentions were good.
You hold me down in the night we tear ourselves apart
You hold me down, I know a place, do you wanna start?
I am the garden, I am the sea, will you lay a trap for me?
I am the garden, I am the sea, will you lay a trap for me?
Ohohohohohoh whoa oh
The sound of fear
Ohohohohohoh whoa oh
The sound of fear
Don't let the story down ooooh
Don't let the story down ooooh
Don't let the story down ooooh
