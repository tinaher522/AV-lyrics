<song artist="Years_&_Years" title="Border">
Stutter your moves, how you wanna play?
Yeah, it's all so easy
When you're the one who loves to pay
Do I remember what I was taught?
Am I gonna catch you?
Is it bright enough to see all we are?
I'll bring you another rush
I'll bring you another rush
I'll bring you another rush
Oh, who we are and what we do
Oh, makes me want it, makes me move
Oh, could I be a warrior?
Oh, do you feel it, does it hurt?
I'm going to the border
My body will be stronger
My heart, it will start to shine
And I will be alright
I'm going to the border
My body will be stronger
My heart, it will start to shine
And I will be alright
Shuffle your heart, tell me who is to blame?
Are you feeling guilty?
Does every corner fill with shame?
Do you require me to let you know you made it through?
That it's getting lighter?
You won't get lost, you'll never lose
Oh, who we are and what we do
Oh, makes me want it, makes me move
Oh, could I be a warrior?
Oh, do you feel it, does it hurt?
I'm going to the border
My body will be stronger
My heart, it will start to shine
And I will be alright
I'm going to the border
My body will be stronger
My heart, it will start to shine
And I will be alright
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I'm going to the border
My body will be stronger
My heart, it will start to shine
And I will be alright
