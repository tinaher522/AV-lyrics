<song artist="Years_&_Years" title="Without">
You're the first one, you're the champion
You're the tall one, you the halcyon
You don't belong to me, you're too far away
And everything falls apart when I try to say
You're in love, in love without me
So close your heart, you'll never find me
Oh, you can hate me now
Cause I'll be gone
And I'll be with you or without
You can count the bones, you can make it worse
How could I have known you're a universe
Follow the marks you left, feel the undertow
The boy that you thought you knew, he's so to hard hold
You're in love, in love without me
So close your heart, you'll never find me
Oh, you can hate me now
Cause I'll be gone
And I'll be with you or without
Oh, we'll keep shivering into the night
I can let you hold me
And tell each other that we might survive
If we keep it going
Oh....
You're in love, in love without me
So close your heart, you'll never find me
Oh, you can hate me now
Cause I'll be gone
And I'll be with you or without
And I'll be with you or without
