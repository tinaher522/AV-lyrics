<song artist="Years_&_Years" title="Ties">
You tell me you like to burn a bridge
That you always make mistakes like this
Are you having fun?
I tell you I've got my secrets too
I go hunting for someone like you
Are you having fun?
Oh, tell me how did it feel?
Did it all get too real for you?
Everybody's screaming out your name
Are you scared?
Cause I don't think you're worth it
Tie you, tie you, tie you, tie you
I just wanna be the one you tie
Tie, tie 
I just wanna be the one you tie
Ties, ties
I just wanna be the one you tie
And you're a dancer well I'm a spy
It's so beautiful to see you lie
Are you having fun?
So give it up, don't need that stress
Because you're still hungry for another test
Are you having fun?
Oh, tell me how did it feel?
Did it all get too real for you?
Everybody's screaming out your name
Are you scared?
Cause I don't think you're worth it
Tie you, tie you, tie you, tie you
I just wanna be the one you tie
Tie, tie 
I just wanna be the one you tie
Tie, tie
I just wanna be the one you tie
Just another bite that takes it higher than before
Did it make you feel good? Does he run away?
Does he fill the space? It feels like you're OK
Just another bite that takes it higher than before
Did it make you feel good? Does he run away?
Does he fill the space? It feels like you're OK
I just wanna be the one you tie
Tie you, tie you, tie you, tie you
I just wanna be the one you tie
Tie, tie 
I just wanna be the one you tie
Tie, tie
I just wanna be the one you tie
