<song artist="Years_&_Years" title="Eyes_Shut">
Throw your heart to me
Let it fall and hit the ground
Let it go
Your timing was so wrong
I feel the light of me
I sigh
I don't ever know why I care
Oooh..I've... I've got the lines
I've got the lines
Yeah, I've got the lines
I've got the lines
Oh it's brighter this time
This type of mine,
This disguise
Oh you talk to me
Nothing's gonna hurt me with my eyes shut
I can see through them
I can see through them
I am drawing pictures I'm evading
I will not use them
I will not use them again
And it starts again
You come over with your friends
I don't want to talk to them
All I really want
Is you to understand 
That I'm a mess
I know you'd like me to go wrong
You'd like me to be gone 
Oooh..I've... I've got the lines
I've got the lines
Yeah, I've got the lines
I've got the lines
Oh it's brighter this time
This type of mine,
This disguise
Oh you talk to me
Nothing's gonna hurt me with my eyes shut
I can see through them
I can see through them
I am drawing pictures I'm evading
I will not use them
I will not use them again
I want to be bigger than life
Hurt you
Hurt you
I want to be bigger than life
Hurt you
Hurt you
