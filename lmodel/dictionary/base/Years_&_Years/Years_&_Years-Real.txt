II broke my bones
Playing games with you
Tired by fun
It makes me blue
Oh I, I think I’m into you
How much do you want it too?
What are you prepared to do?
I think I’m gonna make it worse
I talk to you, but it don’t work
I touch you, but it starts to hurt
What have I been doing wrong?
Tell me what it is you want
Tell me what it is you want
Tell me what it is you 
Oh I think that If I had been enough for you
Would I be better?
Would I be good?
And I‘ll do you what you like if you’ll stay the night
You tell me you don’t think you should
You do it boy
Well love I will let you go
Love I will let you go
Love I will let you go
Love I will let you go
Oh it’s enough to feel better
If I could
I itch all night
I itch for you
You’re just my type
What’s a boy to do?
Oh I, I think I’m into you
How much do you want it too?
What are you prepared to do?
I think I’m gonna make it worse
I talk to you, but it don’t work
I touch you, but it starts to hurt
What have I been doing wrong?
Tell me what it is you want
Tell me what it is you want
Tell me what it is you 
Oh I think that If I had been enough for you
Would I be better?
Would I be good?
And I‘ll do you what you like if you’ll stay the night
You tell me you don’t think you should
You do it boy
Well love I will let you go
Love I will let you go
Love I will let you go
Love I will let you go
Oh it’s enough to feel better
If I could
Yeah, If I had been enough for you 
Would I be better?
Would I be good?
And I‘ll do you what you like if you’ll stay the night
You tell me you don’t think you should
I think you should
Oh Love I will let you go
Love I will let you go
Love I will let you go
Love I will let you go
Oh it’s enough to feel better
If I could
