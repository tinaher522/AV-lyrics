<song artist="Years_&_Years" title="Memo">
Are you gonna hide
Are you gonna burn
Gonna answer me?
I'm gonna take your heart
Love you in the dark,
No one has to see
I-I I want more, I want more
I-I I want more, I want more
Uuh, you seek a self in another way
I try my best but I don't ever change
Uuh, I love to watch your body in light
It makes me feel better, makes me satisfied
No, no, you could bring back
Who wouldn't want it when he looks like that?
Oh oh, I want you to stay
And if I try my hardest, would you look my way?
Are you gonna hurt
Are you gonna burn
Gonna answer me?
I'ma gonna take your heart
Love you in the dark,
No one has to see
I-I I want more, I want more
I-I I want more, I want more
Memo, you could bring it back
Uh, who wouldn't want it when he looks like that?
Oh oh, I want you to stay
And if I try my hardest, would you look my way?
Ooh, are you gonna hurt
Are you gonna burn
Gonna answer me?
I'ma gonna take your heart
Love you in the dark,
No one has to see
I-I I want more, I want more
I-I I want more, I want more
