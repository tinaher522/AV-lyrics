<song artist="Years_&_Years" title="1977">
You dye your hands the color blue
You wash your mouth, you pray for truth
You've seen it all by the grace of God
It's what you've done, it's who you are
Oh, oh, fever
Oh, oh, fever
You drink it all, you'll live tonight
You bite your cheeks, you'll put it right
Oh, oh, fever
Kiss your tongue, you strike a match
Keep it high, you're moving fast
You touch the ground you're slipping through
You'll never know how you can move
Oh, oh, fever
Oh, oh, fever
You drink it all, you'll live tonight
You bite your cheeks, you'll put it right
Oh, oh fever
Oh, ooh
Take all you want from me, it never leaves a scar
Oh, ooh
Hold back the world from me, I've taken this too far
