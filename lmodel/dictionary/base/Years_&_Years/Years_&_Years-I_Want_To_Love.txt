<song artist="Years_&_Years" title="I_Want_To_Love">
I caught a shadow and he wants me to come clean
All of the danger that he wanted me to feel 
Now I'm fighting hunger, swallowing your scars
Pull me under tell me what you want
Cause I, I want to love
I want to love
I want to love
I want to love
I want to love
I want to love
I want to love
I want to love
I want to love
I want to love
I want to love
I want to love
I want to love
I want to love
I want to love
Everybody told me it was bad to do
I know my reasons I won't prove myself to you
I'm not the one you should be playing with
I'll tear you up I won't behave myself for this
No, no, I'm never gonna
No, no, I'm never gonna
No, no, I'm never gonna
I'm never gonna learn
I'm never gonna learn
I made a promise to deliver all the crimes
I don't belong to anybody else's lies
I will take your hunger, give you what you want
Pull you under, I will do you harm
Cause I, I want to love
I want to love
I want to love
I want to love
I want to love
I want to love
I want to love
I want to love
I want to love
I want to love
I want to love
I want to love
I want to love
I want to love
I want to love
Everybody told me it was bad to do
I know my reasons I won't prove myself to you
I'm not the one you should be playing with
I'll tear you up I won't behave myself for this
No, no, I'm never gonna
No, no, I'm never gonna
No, no, I'm never gonna
I'm never gonna learn
I'm never gonna learn
