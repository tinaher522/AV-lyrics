<song artist="Years_&_Years" title="Foundation">
There's a scratch on your shoulder
Crushes me like, crushes me like lead
And I wanna get older
All the things I want I really shouldn't get
If I triumph, are you watching?
Can you separate everything for me?
You used to work me out
But you never worked it out for me
There's a scratch on your shoulder
Crushes me like, crushes me like lead
And I wanna get older
All the things I want I really shouldn't get
If I triumph, are you watching?
Can you separate everything for me?
You used to work me out
But you never worked it out for me
And your head looks good
I wanna love it so much
I wanna be the one
I wanna do what you love
And I was lying
I don't really wanna be fine
It's all over
And there's a scratch on your shoulder
It crushes me like, it crushes me like lead
And I wanna get older
All the things I want I really shouldn't get
