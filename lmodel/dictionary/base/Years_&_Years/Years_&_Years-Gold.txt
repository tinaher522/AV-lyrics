<song artist="Years_&_Years" title="Gold">
Am I defined? Oh
Oh, by the way they look at me
Will I be tried? Oh
Will they take what I believe?
I shiver on the one
I breathe for two
I give you what you want
I bend the truth
And everything's aflame, it's all aglow
I know that I can play that game, I'll fool them all
Oh, like gold, let it lead me astray
Like gold, let it take me away
And if I turn my back and I leave it all
I'll be running fast, cause I can't be owned
Oh, like gold
Do I belong? Oh
I see it start to fade
Teach them a song, oh
Now I feel I've been betrayed
I shiver on the one
I breathe for two
I give you what you want
I bend the truth
And everything's aflame, it's all aglow
I know that I can play that game, I'll fool them all
Oh, like gold, let it lead me astray
Like gold, let it take me away
And if I turn my back and I leave it all
I'll be running fast, cause I can't be owned
Oh, like gold
Everything is brighter now
It shimmers like a stone
And everything surrounds you now
It's you and you alone
Oh, like gold
Oh, like gold
And if I turn my back and I leave it all
I'll be running fast, cause I can't be owned
Oh, like gold
I'm gonna be the one who sets it all alight
I'm gonna be the one who sets it all alight
I'm gonna be the one who sets it all alight
I'm gonna be the one who sets it all alight
