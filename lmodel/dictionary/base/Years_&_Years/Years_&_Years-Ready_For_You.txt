<song artist="Years_&_Years" title="Ready_For_You">
You change the color of your eyes
You make your body move like mine
Did I show you what to do?
I made it easier for you
You've got another boy to lose
Well does he want you like I do?
I bet you've seen it all before
I bet you're always wanting more
You and me, we're keeping secrets now
I'll be good if you can tell me how
Cause I've been wondering lately
Are you the one that's gonna hold me down?
Can you tell me, oh, would you lead me on?
And would you start me over? 
I'm ready to be torn apart
Oh, would you break my heart?
Well I would break it for you
I'm ready to be torn apart
Oh, I'm ready for you, I'm ready for you
I'm ready for you, oh now, I'm ready for you
I'm ready for you, I'm ready for you
I'm ready for you, oh now, I'm ready for you
Do you see me start to play
It's the way that I was made
I refuse to tread the line
Cause I'm happier denied
If you want a love to kill
I can give you lungs to fill
Never ask and never lie
And you never have to hide
You and me, we're making secrets now
I'll be good if you can tell me how
Cause I've been wondering lately
Are you the one that's gonna hold me down?
Can you tell me, oh, would you lead me on?
And would you start me over? 
I'm ready to be torn apart
Oh, would you break my heart?
Well I would break it for you
I'm ready to be torn apart
Oh, I'm ready for you, I'm ready for you
I'm ready for you, oh now, I'm ready for you
I'm ready for you, I'm ready for you
I'm ready for you, oh now, I'm ready for you
Oh, would you lead me on?
And would you start me over? 
I'm ready to be torn apart
Oh, would you break my heart?
Well I would break it for you
I'm ready to be torn apart
Oh, I'm ready for you, I'm ready for you
I'm ready for you, oh now, I'm ready for you
I'm ready for you, I'm ready for you
I'm ready for you, oh now, I'm ready for you
