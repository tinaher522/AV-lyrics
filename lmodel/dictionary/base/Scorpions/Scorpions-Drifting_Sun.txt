<song artist="Scorpions" title="Drifting_Sun">
Well, sitting on a stone 
Sitting all alone 
Sticky things are rolling down the mountain 
Well, see the lonesome tramp 
Who's living in the damp 
Nobody's in the valley 
Shine on, shine on sun 
Oh it's so cold right here 
Shine on, shine on sun 
Shine on all night long, all night long
Daydreams are of silent blue 
Icy wings will carry you 
Midnight sun will never shine 
Just ravings of a fool you think 
And laugh about him all the time 
Shine on, shine on sun 
Oh it's so cold right here 
Shine on, shine on sun 
Shine on all night long, all night long
White pale, velvet, autumn sun will fade away 
Forgotten life will finish now in endless grey 
Some days are drifting haze 
Some days are glowing blaze 
Some days are tides of life 
Staggering along a tropic highway 
Crazy lights are whirling 'round and 'round 
Hell or heaven, night or day? 
Burning fingers push the sun away 
Shine on, shine on sun 
Shine on all night long 
Shine on, shine on sun 
Shine on all night long
