<song artist="Scorpions" title="Love_'Em_Or_Leave_'Em">
Blowing 'cross the universe
Like a shooting star that lost its way
Looking back with no regrets
Living for what hasn't happened yet
Love 'em or leave 'em - No rhyme or reason
Break out to make out - No change in the season
Love 'em or leave 'em - Put out or get out
Simple survival - No more denial
Love 'em or leave 'em
Roller coaster flies off the track
Hits you in the face, stabs you in the back (in the back)
They Jake your right, leave nothing left
Steal you blind, your mind and leave you deaf
Love 'em or leave 'em - No rhyme or reason
State of the nation - Pure intoxication
Feel the vibration - The anticipation
Simple survival - No more denial
Dont wanna waste no time
I'm never losing track
I've seen it all and so much more
But I ain't seen nothing yet
Love 'em or leave 'em - No rhyme or reason
Break out to make out - No change in the season
Feel the vibration - the anticipation
Simple survival - No more denial
Love 'em or leave 'em
Love 'em or leave 'em
Love 'em or leave 'em
Love 'em or leave 'em
Love 'em or leave 'em
Love 'em or leave 'em
