<song artist="Scorpions" title="Pictured_Life">
Ooh, dark meditation
Your second sight can show my light in a crystal ball
Sweet are the days, intoxication
Crow-black the nights, caging my mind behind the wall
Into the rock, through walls of red dreams
Into the rock, to find the cream
Into the rock, through walls of red dreams
Pictured life from yesterday
Ooh, dark meditation
Deep down inside, a stream of light begins to flow
Sweet are the days, intoxication
Crow-black the nights, caging my mind behind the wall
Into the rock, through walls of red dreams
Into the rock, to find the cream
Into the rock, through walls of red dreams
Pictured life from yesterday
Pictured life, pictured life
Pictured life from yesterday
