<song artist="Scorpions" title="Mind_Like_A_Tree">
Come with me come with me now
Inside the garden
Inside the garden of god
Smell the sand it's running through your hands
It's where we're from
And where we'll go in the end
Hear me calling
Hear me calling
My mind is like a tree
And I want you to water me
You gotta spread the
You gotta spread the seed
Hear me calling
Hear me calling
Sit in the shadow just smell the grass
Where the past is buried
Where the future grows so fast
My mind is like a tree
And I want you to water me
You gotta spread the
You gotta spread the seed
Hear me calling
Hear me calling
You touch me so
You touch me so deep
I only wish my eyes could see
The way you feel for me
To hear me calling
To hear me calling
My mind is like a tree
And I want you to water me
You gotta spread the
You gotta spread the seed
To hear me calling
To hear me calling
Take my hand
Make me see
