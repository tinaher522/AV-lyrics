<song artist="Scorpions" title="Born_To_Touch_Your_Feelings">
I was born from the sound of the strings
For someone to give everything
To be your song just for your feeling
Close your eyes and I'll try to get in
To waken your heart like the spring
'Cause I was born to touch your feelings
Steal the time, take a song and be glad
Be free as the birds, don't be sad
Your time will come, I'll make you feel it
You're still young like the sun after rain
Follow the light it's not in vain
And you will see I'll touch your feelings
You've got your songs, they are everyday
For a while, just the only way
To feel alright
You've got your songs, they are everyday
For a while, just the only way
To feel alright
You were born just to lose or to win
To be someone's chime in the wind
To live between your mind and feelings
Find your way, check it out, learn each day
Follow the light, it's not in vain
And you will see I'll touch your feelings
You've got your songs
They are everyday for awhile
Just the only way to feel alright
You've got your songs
They are everyday for awhile
Just the only way to feel alright
You've got your songs, they are everyday
For a while, just the only way
To feel alright
You've got your songs, they are everyday
For a while, just the only way
To feel alright
I was born from the sound of the strings
For someone to give everything
To be a song just for your feeling
I was born from the sound of the strings
For someone to give everything
To be a song just for your feeling
