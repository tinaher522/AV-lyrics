<song artist="Scorpions" title="Hour_I">
So here we are, it's hour one and it's a nightmare
There's nothing left and yet it's good to be alive
There's no use crying, 'cause the universe is not fair
The wicked and the innocent are fighting to survive
Child
Stay down
Stay down
You better run for cover underground
Child
Stay down
Stay down
You better shut your mouth, don't make a sound
Human nature is the reason for our downfall
And we deserve it, playing God with our machines
Our religions are a prison, that's our fatal flaw
Bombs are flying while we're sleeping with the enemy
Child
Stay down
Stay down
You better run for cover underground
Child
Stay down
Stay down
You better shut your mouth, don't make a sound
Look at me, right at me when I'm telling you to stay down
Come to me, run to me, I am begging you to stay down
Cling to me desperately, all you gotta do is stay down
Pay attention my child down
Look at me, right at me when I'm telling you to stay down
Come to me, run to me, I am begging you to stay down
Cling to me desperately, all you gotta do is stay down
Pay attention my child
Child
Stay down
Stay down
You better run for cover underground
Child
Stay down
Stay down
You better shut your mouth, don't make a sound
Child
Stay down
Stay down
You better run for cover underground
Child
Stay down
Stay down
