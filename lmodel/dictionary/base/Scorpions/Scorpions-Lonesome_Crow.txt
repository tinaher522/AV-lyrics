<song artist="Scorpions" title="Lonesome_Crow">
Sunday's gone
Months're gone
Some learn they're there
Lonesome crow
Where are they from
Where are their thoughts
No, nobody knows
Or even thought
Please follow them
Will surely be said
Ooooow!
Aaaah Ahahahah Ahahahah Ahahahah Ahahahah Haaaah
No, nobody knows
Or even thought
Please follow them
Will surely be said
