<song artist="Scorpions" title="Oh_Girl_(I_Wanna_Be_With_You)">
Do do do do
Do do do do
Away for a long time but never gone
So many good times that I recall
Forgive me that I've been kind of blind
I've been running away most of my life
Girl, I wanna be with you
It's no one else it's only you
Oh, girl I wanna stay with you
With no one else just with you
I was lost for a long time couldn't find myself
The cry for love was the cry for help
Forgive me that I've been so untrue
The one who saved me's been always you (yeah)
Girl, I wanna be with you
It's no one else it's only you
Oh, girl I wanna stay with you
With no one else just with you
With no one else just with you
Life's been dancin' on a razorblade
I had my share of love and hate
Well,after all I found myself
Cause it's you who makes me live
It's only you who can forgive
Away for a long time but never gone
Sometimes life just takes the long way home
You're still the one I'm dreamin' of
Cause when your heart is talkin' you know it's love
Oh, girl, I wanna be with you
It's no one else it's only you
Oh, girl I wanna stay with you
With no one else just with you
Oh, girl, I wanna be with you
It's no one else it's only you
Oh, girl I wanna stay with you
With no one else just with you
With no one else just with you
