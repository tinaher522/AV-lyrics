<song artist="Scorpions" title="They_Need_A_Million">
I see a rainbow in the sky
So many colors and the light
I see the world and I see all the people
How they're running all the time
I see your shadow over me
Many miles I hear a symphony
I see the world and I see all the people
What they are doing what they need
They need a million and a billion
And your money too
They need a million and a billion
And your money too
I feel fine though I realize
That I don't need the million
They are all poor
I feel fine though I have eyes
To see my world and all it skits on ice
I feel fine though I realize
That I don't need the million
They are all poor
I feel fine though I have eyes
To see my world and all it skits on ice
