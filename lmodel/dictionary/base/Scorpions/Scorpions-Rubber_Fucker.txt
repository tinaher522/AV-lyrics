<song artist="Scorpions" title="Rubber_Fucker">
Be a lover
Undercover
Be a rubber fucker
Be a lover
Like no other
Be a rubber fucker
You know that love
Ain't easy today
So play it safe
It's the only way
Don't think twice
Before you make it tonight
So, come on, baby
It's alright
Be a lover
Undercover
Be a rubber fucker
Be a lover
Don't be a sucker
Be a rubber fucker
It's like when women
Can never tell
What kind of lady
Just to take her to hell
New lovers come
New lovers go
Hey baby
You never know

Be a lover
Undercover
Be a rubber fucker
Be a lover
Just like no other
Be a rubber fucker
You can do it
Dressed up or nude
Whatever does it
Does it for you
Come on baby
Let's do it right
You're gonna
Spend the night
With a lover
Undercover
With a rubber fucker
With a lover
Just like no other
With a rubber fucker
Be a lover
Undercover
Be a rubber fucker
Be a lover
Don't be a sucker
Be a rubber rubber rubber rubber fucker
Be a lover
Undercover
Be a rubber fucker
Be a lover
Just like no other
Be a rubber fucker
