<song artist="Scorpions" title="Rock_'N'_Roll_Band">
Pick up my guitar, rock this town
When passion rules I can't slow down
I'm walking down the street of hungry hearts
Where heaven cries when angels fall
A Hollywood stage, girls in a cage
Action, satisfaction, legs around the pole
Bang, I'm in the spot, give me that shot
We rock the night away and that's the way it goes
You wanna know who I am
I'm in a Rock 'n' Roll Band
In a Rock 'n' Roll Band
I'm in a Rock 'n' Roll Band
In a Rock 'n' Roll Band
Oh yeah, yes, I am
She walks into the light looking hot
I love the way she moves, oh my god
Just another tune, her heart goes boom
Come on, little lady, show me all you've got
Roaring machines, wet, wet dreams
Too much of everything can never be too much
Don't wake me up, don't bring me down
Rock 'n' Roll forever, that's my drug
You wanna know who I am
I'm in a Rock 'n' Roll Band
In a Rock 'n' Roll Band
I'm in a Rock 'n' Roll Band
In a Rock 'n' Roll Band
Oh yes, I am
Night after night
It's like a rollercoaster ride
And when we'll crash, we're gonna fall
Into the heart of Rock 'n' Roll
You wanna know who I am
I'm in a Rock 'n' Roll Band
In a Rock 'n' Roll Band
I'm in a Rock 'n' Roll Band
Yeah, In a Rock 'n' Roll Band
Yes, I am
Rock 'n' Roll Band
I'm in a Rock 'n' Roll Band
Yes, I am
In a Rock 'n' Roll Band
I'm in a Rock 'n' Roll Band
I'm in a Rock 'n' Roll
I'm in a Rock 'n' Roll
I'm in a Rock 'n' Roll Band
