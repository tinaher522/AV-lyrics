<song artist="Scorpions" title="Moment_Of_Glory">
Moment of glory count evolution
Could I see the world with the eyes of a child
A new beginning a moment of freedom
Like angels are singing a song full of joy
This side of heaven belongs to the children
I will be there when the future arrives
Moment of glory count evolution
Could I fly away like a bird in the sky
No imitation a new inspiration
A world and it's creatures is free as my life
Communication a new destination
Planning our visions is calling tonight
Another thousand  years seems so long
I'm just a passenger
And the ride, it's just begun
(Moment of glory, moment of glory)
Moment of glory (of glory)
Moment of glory count evolution
Could I see the world with the eyes of a child
A new beginning (a new beginning) 
A moment of freedom (moment of freedom)
Like angels are singing (angels are singing)
A song full of joy
This side of heaven belongs to the children
I will be there when the future arrives
Moment of glory, moment of glory (moment of glory)
Moment of glory, moment of glory (moment of glory, of glory)
(Moment of glory count evolution
Could I see the world with the eyes of a child
A new beginning a moment of freedom
When angels are singing a song full of joy)
