<song artist="Scorpions" title="To_Be_With_You_In_Heaven">
You can shoot me down.
You can drag me round. 
Girl I'll get you, it won't be long.
You can smash my heart, you can trash our love.
But my desire for you, is much too strong.
To be with you in heaven, I would go through the darkest hell.
In heaven, there's no cure for love that kills.
You can waste my time but you can't change my mind.
I will stop you, so just go on.
You can play your games but it's all in vain.
Cause my desire for you is much too strong.
To be with you in heaven, I would go through the darkest hell.
In heaven, there's no cure for love that kills.
To be with you in heaven, I would go through the darkest hell.
In heaven, there's no cure for love that kills.
Girl I'm on fire, heaven seems so close tonight.
Girl, I would die for your love.
You can shoot me down.
You can drag me round. 
Girl I'll get you, it won't be long.
You can smash my heart, you can trash our love.
But my desire for you, is much too strong.
To be with you in heaven, I would go through the darkest hell.
In heaven, there's no cure for love that kills.
To be with you in heaven, I would go through the darkest hell.
In heaven, there's no cure for love that kills.
To be with you in heaven, I would go through the darkest hell.
In heaven, there's no cure for love that kills.
To be with you in heaven...
