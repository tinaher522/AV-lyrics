<song artist="Scorpions" title="This_Time">
I wanna know what you've got to say
Don't wanna wait any longer
I feel all shook up since you walked my way
You make me feel so much stronger
Hey little baby
I wanna go your way
This time
I want to disregard this feeling of tainted love
This time
Don't wanna be a part of playing the game of higher love
When you're mine
Now you see what you've done to me
Don't wanna wait too much longer
I feel sideways up since you walked my way
My feel for you keeps getting stronger
Hey little baby
I wanna go your way
This time
I want to disregard this feeling of tainted love
This time
Don't wanna be a part of playing the game of higher love
Just make you mine
This time
I want to disregard this feeling of tainted love
This time
I want to take the chance to rearrange my view of love
This time
I want to disregard this feeling of tainted love
This time
I want to take the chance to sort it all out in advance
And make you mine
