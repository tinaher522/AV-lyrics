<song artist="Scorpions" title="Believe_In_Me">
How does it feel babe
To taste sweet revenge
Do you want me on my knees
How does it feel babe
To let me feel your strength
Don't be cruel, can't you see
If you don't catch me now
I can't stop falling down
Just one more night
And the devil's got my soul
I need your love babe
Don't tell me no way
Babe I miss you so much
More than words can say
How does it feel babe
To kill our destiny
I swear I'm not gonna crawl
Oh, no
How does it feel babe
To make a fool out of me
How can you be so cold
Be so cold
If you don't catch me now
I can't stop falling down
Just one more night
And the devil's got my soul
I need your love babe
Don't treat me this way
Ooh, I miss you, I miss you
Baby our love's got what it takes
To give us one more chance
To start once again
Baby, our love will find a way
As long as we believe in love
