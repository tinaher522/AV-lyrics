<song artist="Scorpions" title="Kiss_Of_Borrowed_Time">
Leaves are falling from the trees
More than anything I want to be
Close to you back in your arms
I swear I'm still in love
Don't say a word just wait
As the bell will ring across the street we know
Those memories never go
Leaves are falling from the sky
Why don't we give it just another try
When the winter comes along
The shadows will be gone
The ice will melt away
'Cause in front of the old fireplace is warm
Oooh, welcome home
Let me take you back again
To a love that's got a name
For you and me
Another day another chance
Only love will kill the pain
That hurts so deep
Don't waste a moment of your life
'Cause it's just a kiss of borrowed time
Let me take you back again
To a love that's got a name
For you and me
Another day another chance
Only love will kill the pain
That hurts so deep
And we taste that wine
Just another sip of borrowed time
