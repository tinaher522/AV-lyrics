<song artist="Scorpions" title="Yellow_Butterfly">
In the temple of the gods
The day had come to come together
In the early morning sun
They saw that girl that came to heaven..
They asked her 'bout life on Earth
If it was getting any better
She told 'em someone took her life
If they could send her back just one more time
She knew that someone feels so blue
Hold on
Wouldn't it be nice (Hold on, hold on, hold on)
To spread the wings and fly (Hold on, hold on, hold on)
To see him one more time
To be a yellow butterfly
He's been sitting on the bay
Lost inside a cloud of darkness
When he saw the butterfly dancing in the wind
The story goes
He knew that she was still soo close
Hold on
Wouldn't it be nice (Hold on, hold on, hold on)
To spread the wings and fly (Hold on, hold on, hold on)
To see him one more time
To be a yellow butterfly
Wouldn't it be nice...To spread the wings and fly.... To be a yellow...
Hold on
Wouldn't it be nice (Um wouldn't it b nice)
To spread the wings and fly (Hold on, hold on, hold on)
To see him one more time
To be a yellow butterfly
