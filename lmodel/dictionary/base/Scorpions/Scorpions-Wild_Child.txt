<song artist="Scorpions" title="Wild_Child">
Don't hear the phone that rings
I know that fever's comin'
God knows what life will bring
This Sunday morning
Sunday morning without a warning
Don't hear the neighbour scream
He thinks my house is burning
Life is good to me
This Sunday morning
She's a wild child
And her l-l-love turns a man insane
She's a wild child
And the love she makes rocks the mind off my brain
Don't hear the backdoor crack
Don't see the cops are comin' back
Its burnin' in my bed
This Sunday morning
She's a wild child
And her l-l-love turns a man insane
She's a wild child (She's a wild child)
And the love she makes rocks the mind off my brain
She's on fire
She's on fire
She's on fire
She's a wild child
And her l-l-love turns a man insane
She's a wild child
And the love she makes rocks the mind off my brain

She's a wild child
She's a wild child
Yeah
She's a wild child (she's a wild child)
And her l-l-love turns a man insane
She's a wild child (she's a wild child)
And the love she makes rocks the mind off my brain
