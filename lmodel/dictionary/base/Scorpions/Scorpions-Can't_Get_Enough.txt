<song artist="Scorpions" title="Can't_Get_Enough">
That's the stuff that turns me on
More than gold and money
I need sounds loud and rough
Like the bee the honey my love
I can't get enough
Move you legs stamp your feet
The language of your body
Is right now all need
To understand you're ready for love
I can't get enough
Burning lips the taste of life
High energy hot feelings
Heavy sounds to feel alright
And rock 'n' roll for speed kings my love
I can't get enough
We can't get enough
