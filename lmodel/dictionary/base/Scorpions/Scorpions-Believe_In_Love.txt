<song artist="Scorpions" title="Believe_In_Love">
How does it feel babe, to taste sweet revenge?
Do you want me on my knees?
How does it feel babe, to let me feel your strength?
Don't be cruel, can't you see?
If you don't catch me now, I can't stop falling down.
Just one more night and the devil got my soul.
I need your love babe, don't tell me: No way!
Uh, I miss you so much more than words can say.
How does it feel babe, to kill our destiny?
I swear I'm not gonna crawl, oh no!
How does it fell babe, to make a fool out of me?
How can you be so cold, be so cold?
If you don't catch me now, I can't stop falling down.
Just one more night and the devil got my soul.
I need your love babe, don't treat me this way!
Uh, I miss you, I miss you!
Baby our love's got what it takes,
To give us one more chance to start, once again.
Baby our love will find a way,
As long as we believe in love.
If you don't catch me now, I can't stop falling down.
Just one more night and the devil got my soul.
I need your love babe, don't leave me this way!
Uh, I miss you, I miss you.
Baby our love's got what it takes,
To give us one more chance to start, once again.
Baby our love will find a way,
As long as we believe in love.
As long as we believe...
Baby our love's got what it takes,
To give us one more chance to start, once again.
Baby our love will find a way,
As long as we believe in love.
Baby our love's got what it takes,
To give us one more chance to start, once again.
Baby our love will find a way,
As long as we believe in love.
Baby our love's got what it takes,
To give us one more chance...
