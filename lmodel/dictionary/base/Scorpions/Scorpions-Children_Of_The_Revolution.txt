<song artist="Scorpions" title="Children_Of_The_Revolution">
Well you can bump and grind 
If it's good for your mind 
Well you can twist and shout let it all hang out 
But you won't fool the children of the revolution 
No you won't fool the children of the revolution, no no no 
Well you can tear a plane in the falling rain 
I drive a Rolls Royce 'cos it's good for my voice 
But you won't fool the children of the revolution 
No you won't fool the children of the revolution, no no no
Well you can bump and grind 
If it's good for your mind 
Well you can twist and shout let it all hang out 
But you won't fool the children of the revolution 
No you won't fool the children of the revolution,
No you won't fool the children of the revolution 
No you won't fool the children of the revolution, no no no
Children of the revolution, no, no, no
No, no, no
No, no, no
Children of the revolution.
