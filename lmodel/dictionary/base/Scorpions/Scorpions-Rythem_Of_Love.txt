<song artist="Scorpions" title="Rythem_Of_Love">
Let's spend the night together
I know you want it too
The magic of the moment
Is what I've got for you
The heartbeat of this night
Just makes me lose control
And there is something in your eyes
That's longing for some more
Let us find together
The beat we're looking for
The rythem of love
Keeps me dancing on the road
The rythem of love
Got the groove that hits the bone
The rythem of love
Is the game I'm looking for
The rythem of love
Is the heartbeat of my soul
Let's reach the top together
One night will never do
An exploding shot of pleasure
Is what I've got for you
Why don't you close your eyes?
Let your feeling grow
I make you feel the taste of life
Until your love will flow
Let us find together
The beat we're looking for
The rythem of love
Keeps me dancing on the road
The rythem of love
Got the groove that hits the bone
The rythem of love
Is the game I'm looking for
The rythem of love
Is the heartbeat of my soul
The rythem of love
Keeps me dancing on the road
The rythem of love
Got the groove that hits the bone
The rythem of love
Is the game I'm looking for
The rythem of love
Is the heartbeat of my soul
The rythem of love
Keeps me dancing on the road
The rythem of love
Got the groove that hits the bone
The rythem of love
Is the game I'm looking for
The rythem of love
Is the heartbeat of my soul
Let us find together
The beat we're looking for
