Well here comes my baby
She's dressed oh so cute
She looks a little crazy
In her Hollywood shoes
Well baby loves driving
In my hot brand new car
She thinks less than flying
Is not fast enough
But when you turn upside down
Life ain't too much fun
I wanted to cry
But the tears wouldn't come
Here comes my baby
She's the one I adore
Well she's a lucky lady
Born in a Gucci store
With gold cards in motion
And the platinum too
She jets across the ocean
A little faster than you
But when it rains in St. Barth
Life ain't too much fun
I wanted to cry
But the tears wouldn't come
I wanted to cry
But the tears wouldn't come
Every night without you
I miss to have you by my side
Ohh, so I keep waiting, I keep waiting
I swear I never let you go again
Well here comes my baby
With a Brad Pitt lookalike
Right through immigration
And straight out of my life
Well it seems the friendly skies
Are pretty good fun
I wanted to cry
But the tears wouldn't come
I wanted to cry
I wanted to cry
I wanted to cry
But the tears wouldn't come
