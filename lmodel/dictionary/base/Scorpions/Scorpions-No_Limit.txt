<song artist="Scorpions" title="No_Limit">
What’s the noise who’s to blame
The Maserati comes unchained
Smell the power, the energy
Come away, come away, come away
You’re the rider of the wildest storm
Live the dream before it's gone
Feel the spirit that sets you free
Come away, come away, come away
You gotta live it up there’s no limit
We gotta make it
You give it all you’ve got there’s no limit
Reach for the sky
We gonna leave for tomorrowland
We ’ve got the future in our hands
A piece of heaven for you and me
Come away, come away, come away
You gotta live it up there’s no limit
We gotta make it
You give it all you’ve got there’s no limit
Reach for the sky
You gotta let it go there’s no limit
We gotta take it
You leave me hot and cold there’s no limit
Out of my mind
Higher higher
Take me higher always higher
Reach for the sky
