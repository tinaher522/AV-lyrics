<song artist="Scorpions" title="A_Moment_In_A_Million_Years">
The lights are slowly fading down
There's no one else, just you and me
Nothing ever change
I see your faces in the crowd
It seems I know each one of you
For all my life
I wish this night could last forever
But it's time to go
I saw you laugh, I saw you cry
All for one and one for all
Nothing ever change
The way you sang just blew my mind
It gave me chills from head to toe
What a glorious night
To me it could have last forever
But it's time to go
A moment in a million years
Is all I've got for you
A moment in a million years
To make some dreams come true
A moment that I won't forget
Until the day I die
A moment in a million years
Called life
The bus is waiting right outside
To hit the road and once again
I leave you all behind
I chase another dream tonight
And by the time you'll be home
I'll be far away
I wish this night could last for ever
But it's time to go
A moment in a million years
Is all I've got for you
A moment in a million years
To make some dreams come true
A moment that I won't forget
Until the day I die
A moment in a million years
Called life
Yeeeeeeeah Ahhhhhhhhaha
A moment that I can't forget.
Until the day I die.
A moment in a million years.
Called life.
