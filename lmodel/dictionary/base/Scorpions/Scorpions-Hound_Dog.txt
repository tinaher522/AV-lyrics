<song artist="Scorpions" title="Hound_Dog">
You ain't nothing but a hound dog
Crying all the time
You ain't nothing but a hound dog
Crying all the time
You ain't never caught a rabbit
And you ain't no friend of mine
When they said you was high classed
It was just a lie
When they said you was high classed
It was just a lie
You ain't never caught a rabbit
And you ain't no friend of mine
