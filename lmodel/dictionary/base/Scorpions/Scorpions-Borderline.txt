<song artist="Scorpions" title="Borderline">
You're like a brother, just like no other
You keep the torch, that eternal flame
We bought the ticket, that one-way ticket
The hottest seat on the crazy train
lt takes power to walk in our shoes (in our shoes)
lt takes power to walk on
We walk the borderline
Crossing those ice-cold waters
We jump into the fire
Riding the wildest storm
We rock the planet, up to the zenith
Feel that adrenalin overload
Can't stop the fever, that road fever
It's in my blood, in every single bone
lt takes power to walk in our shoes (in our shoes)
lt takes power to walk on
We walk the borderline
Crossing those ice-cold waters
We jump into the fire
Riding the wildest storm
We walk the borderline
Doing it now or never
We walk into the light
Bringing this baby home
Another day around the corner
There is sunshine after rain
This journey is going on forever (forever)
Home is where my heart is
And I'm always on my way
I don't look back now
We don't look back now
lt takes power to walk on
We walk the borderline
Crossing those ice-cold waters
We jump into the fire
Riding the wildest storm
We walk the borderline
Doing it now or never
We walk into the light
Bringing this baby home
We walk the borderline
Crossing those ice-cold waters
We jump into the fire
Riding the wildest storm
We walk the borderline
Doing it now or never
We walk into the light
Bringing this baby home
