<song artist="Scorpions" title="Let's_Rock">
She looked like mother nature
Dressed up in black
She had a yin and a yang
Tattooed on her back
She was a pretty little blonde on a big white horse
I wanted a ride, she said of course
Let’s rock, let’s roll
The party’s on, we’re having a ball
We’re gonna leave a sting in your soul
We put the rock back in the roll
Let’s rock, let’s roll
She looked like a dancer
And god only knows
She must have had a little thing
For scorpions
To make a little love would be no crime
And what came next really blew my mind
Let’s rock, let’s roll
The party’s on, we’re having a ball
We’re gonna leave a sting in your soul
We put the rock back in the roll
Let’s rock, let’s roll
Coming together
Rocking forever, let’s rock
The party’s on
All night long, let’s rock
Let’s rock, let’s roll
The party’s on, we’re having a ball
We’re gonna leave a sting in your soul
We put the rock back in the roll
Let’s rock, let’s roll
The party’s on, we’re losing control
We’re gonna leave a sting in your soul
We put the rock back in the roll
We’re gonna leave a sting in your soul
A sting in your soul
