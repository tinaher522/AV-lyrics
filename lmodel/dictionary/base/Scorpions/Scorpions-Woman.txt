<song artist="Scorpions" title="Woman">
Woman... you can change my world...
Woman... you can change my world...
I'm chained to the fears inside these walls
The silence talks loud  'bout the things I recall
Through the bricks in the window, I scream at the world
But when no one is listening, it's hard to be heard
Woman... you can change my world... yeah...
Woman... there'll be no return...
I see shadows coming through the walls
I hear voices but no one's talking at all
I can feel the madness crawling up my spine
Reachin' out  to grab your mind...
Woman... come and change my world...
Do you remember all those fears?
They won't leave me alone...
Do you remember all those tears?
I pretend to be strong...
Do you remember all the pain?
I'm getting tired of the game...
I cannot live, I cannot die...
I wanna know who the hell am I!!!
You've never seen me but I know you so well
And before it kills me I gotta break the spell
The deeper we touch, the higher we'll go
The time has come to heal my soul...
Woman... yeah... you can change my world...
Do you remember all those fears?
They won't leave me alone...
Do you remember all those tears?
I pretend to be strong...
Do you remember all the pain?
I'm getting tired of the game...
I cannot live, I cannot die...
I wanna know who the hell am I!!!
Woman... I'm gonna change your world...
Oooh yeah.... (gonna change your world)
