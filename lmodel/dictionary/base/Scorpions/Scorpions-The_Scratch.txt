<song artist="Scorpions" title="The_Scratch">
It's been so long out on the road
Weeks and months gone by
You lost some weight and you shed your load
Your well is running dry
I got an itch you cannot scratch, cannot scratch
Feels like someone's coming back, coming back
Looks like we're about to have some fun, fun, fun
Yeah
So here I come
And you're the one (two, three, four)
Babe, I'm here, I'm back
So love me do
I want you too (three, four, five)
Babe, I'm buzzin' around your hive
The years that passed, they've not been kind
I'm thinking more and more
About the girl that I left behind
When I walked out that door
Turn around, I'm coming back, coming back
There's that itch I cannot scratch, cannot scratch
Looks like we're about to have more fun, fun, fun
Yes
So here I come
And you're the one (two, three, four)
Babe, I'm here, I'm back
So love me do
I want you too (three, four, five)
Babe, I'm buzzin' around your hive
Yeah here I come
Yeah here I come
And you're the one (two, three, four)
Babe, I'm here, I'm back
So love me do
I want you too (three, four, five)
Babe, I'm buzzin' around your hive
Around your hive
Yeah
