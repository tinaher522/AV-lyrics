<song artist="Scorpions" title="Inheritance">
Testament, deferment
Bloody money when it's lent
Scum reappear everywhere
They want money, oh
Heavenly would it be
If some money belong to me
I will pray, they will say
Give your money, oh
Obligator came and said to me
Why don't you pay your debt
The debt that you owe me
Asking him for give up his demand
For I am without means despite inheritance
Remittance of the debt I can't accept
He told me and he kept quite tight on his demand
Imaginations came into my brain
Cause situations came
That brings me in my grave
Testament, deferment
Bloody money when it's lent
Scum reappear everywhere
They want money, oh
