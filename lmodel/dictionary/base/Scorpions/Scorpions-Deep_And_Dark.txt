<song artist="Scorpions" title="Deep_And_Dark">
Down, I am down
On the ground, sad and tired
I'm down, it's over now
Yes I'm down, should I like it?
It's deep and dark
Deep down in my heart
lt's deep and dark
Since we've been apart
ls this love that comes around
That takes me up light years higher?
'Cause I, I wanna feel love 
Once again
It's deep and dark
Deep down in my heart
lt's deep and dark
Since we've been apart
It's deep and dark
Deep down in my heart
lt's deep and dark
Without someone's love
It's deep and dark
Deep down in my heart
lt's deep and dark
Since we've been apart
It's deep and dark
Deep down in my heart
lt's deep and dark
Without someone's love
Someone's love...
