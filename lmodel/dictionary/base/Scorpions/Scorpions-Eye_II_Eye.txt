<song artist="Scorpions" title="Eye_II_Eye">
A life begins, another's over
As another day begins
Life runs full circle getting older
It happens to me, it happens to you
I do believe you're still around me
You're still around me all the time
I have no doubt one day in Heaven
I will see you again, I'll see you again, see you again
Break the bread and drink the wine, in my heart you'll live forever
The time to go is never right when we say goodbye
While we're here we shouldn't waste a day in life to say I love you
It's now that I just wish so much to see you
Eye to eye
Eye to eye
When you came home the war was over
So many years before my time
I was so proud the day you told me
You haven't hurt anyone, no one
Break the bread and drink the wine, in my heart you'll live forever
The time to go is never right when we say goodbye
While we're here we shouldn't waste a day in life to say I love you
It's now that I just wish so much to see you
Eye to eye
Eye to eye
Eye to eye
Eye to eye
Break the bread and drink the wine, in my heart you'll live forever
The time to go is never right when we say goodbye
While we're here we shouldn't waste a day in life to say I love you
It's now that I just wish so much to see you
Eye to eye
Eye to eye
Eye to eye
Eye to eye
Eye to eye
Eye to eye
Eye to eye
Eye to eye
