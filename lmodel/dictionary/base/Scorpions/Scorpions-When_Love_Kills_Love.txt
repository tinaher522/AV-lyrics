<song artist="Scorpions" title="When_Love_Kills_Love">
When love kills love
Suddenly I think I always knew
I had my share of mistakes made quite a few
Finally I know when that's for sure
I don't look back in anger anymore
Suddenly the sun comes up again
There's a new beginning when we pass the end
Finally I know when that's for sure
I don't look back in anger anymore
When love kills love
Will someone rescue me
When love kills love
It's cutting through so deep
Suddenly I wake up from a dream
Someone tells me I've been talking in my sleep
Finally I know when that's for sure
I don't believe in daydreams anymore
When love kills love
Will someone set me free
When love kills love
It's cutting through so deep
When life goes wrong
And upside down
It's pretty mad
When love kills love
Will someone set me free
When love kills love
It's cutting through so deep
How can we choose when all we loose is all we have
We run away from all the pain
When love kills love
Will someone rescue me
When love kills love
It's cutting through so deep
When love kills love
