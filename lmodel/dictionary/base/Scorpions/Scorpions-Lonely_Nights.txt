<song artist="Scorpions" title="Lonely_Nights">
Since you're gone there is an empty space
Since you're gone the world is not the same
I go back to the places we've been
Feels like you're still there
I live all those moments again
Wishing you were here
Since you're gone there is a lonely heart
Since you're gone nothing is like it was
There are memories all over the place
Bringing it back all so clear
Remember all of those days
Wishing you were here
All those lonely nights, lonely nights
Lonely nights, lonely nights, lonely nights
I got to fight for you, yes I do
All those lonely nights, lonely nights
Lonely nights, lonely nights, lonely nights
I got to fight for you, yes I do
Yes, I do
Since you're gone there is a heart that bleed
Since you're gone I'm not the man I used to be
I follow your steps in the snow
Traces disappear
We know what we've lost when it's gone
I'm wishing you were here
All those lonely nights, lonely nights
Lonely nights, lonely nights, lonely nights
I got to fight for you, yes I do
All those lonely nights, lonely nights
Lonely nights, lonely nights, lonely nights
I got to fight for you, yes I do
Yes, I do
I go back to the places we've been
Feels like you're still there
I live all those moments again
Wishing you were here
All those lonely nights, lonely nights, lonely nights...
