<song artist="Scorpions" title="Money_And_Fame">
You know nothing about loving
You lost somewhere down the line
You know nothing about giving
You should draw the line
You keep looking out for something
Something you're never gonna find
When will, will you show your feelings
You will lose your mind
Who's to blame my love
You play a dangerous game
Who's to blame my love
All you want is money and fame
You play, play with emotions
You need, need a stepping stone
You're out, out for sensations
Don't you, don't you feel alone
Who's to blame my love
You play a dangerous game
Who's to blame my love
All you want is money and fame
Who's to blame my love
You play a dangerous game
Who's to blame my love
All you want is money and fame
Money and fame
Money and fame
Money and fame
Money and fame
Money and fame
Money and fame
Money and fame
