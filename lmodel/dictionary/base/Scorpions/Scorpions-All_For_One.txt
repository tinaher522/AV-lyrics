<song artist="Scorpions" title="All_For_One">
The weekend comes around
The gang is back in town
We love Saturdays
We love Saturdays
Another drink to slam
The Girls Wham Bang
The Band starts to play
The Band starts to play
That road fever never leaves me cold
Son of a gun, you never let me go
All for one standing tall through high and low
All for one we ride the storm where it may blow
All for one and one for all
And one for all
A California jam
Meet some good old friends
The city never sleeps
The city never sleeps
And when we hit the road
Watch out for trouble, bro
Don't mess with rattlesnakes
Don't mess with rattlesnakes
That road fever hits me and I guess
I won't stop till they'll lay my bones to rest
All for one standing tall through high and low
All for one we ride the storm where it may blow
All for one and one for all
And one for all
Once I did only care about myself
Once I was lost and lonely
Road can be heaven, road can be hell
So if you want me, call me
That road fever never leaves me cold
Son of a gun, you never let me go
All for one standing tall through high and low
All for one we ride the storm where it may blow
All for one just down the road, go, go, go
All for one always fast and never slow
All for one and one for all
And one for all
All for one and one for all
Yeah
