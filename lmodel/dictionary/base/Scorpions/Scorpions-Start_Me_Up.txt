<song artist="Scorpions" title="Start_Me_Up">
I'm eating nothing much
It makes my motor run
Another winding road
Another place
Without a stop
Without a break
I'm back with you
You know I just can't wait.
Damn you slam you, eat me like a menu
Take it brake it, kick it to the ground
Empty hollow, it's so hard to swallow
Gotta know what's your size
Start me up, knock me down
As bad as you have been
You're turning off
You're waking up
Just lay your hands on me.
I'm eating up the hours
It makes my engine run
Never running out of fume
But it might as week
Each single day
It seems too long
To be away from you
Ammo slammo, it's gotta go blammo
Lust you bust you, can I ever trust you
Scare you dare you, anyway I want you
Catch you grab you now

Start me up (start me, start me)
Knock me down (knock me, knock me)
As hard as you have been
And every time (time, time)
I'd die for you (die for you)
You take a piece of me (of me)
Hard ass lard ass, keep your hands off my stash
Holy stoli gotta have a stogie
Master blaster, buy a jabocaster
Gotta eat your heart out now
Start me up (start me, start me)
Knock me down (knock me, knock me)
As bad as you have been
You're turning off (turning, turning)
You're waking up (waking, waking)
? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? .
Start me up (start me, start me)
Knock me down (knock me, knock me)
As hard as you have been
You're turning off (turning, turning)
You're waking up (waking, waking)
Just lay your hands on me (on me).
Damn you slam you, eat me like a menu
Take it brake it, kick it to the ground
Empty hollow, it's so hard to swallow
Gotta know what's your size
Ammo slammo, it's gotta go blammo
Lust you bust you, can I ever trust you
Scare you dare you, anyway I want you
Start me up now
