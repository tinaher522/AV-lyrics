Hard rock this joint!
Hard rock this joint!
Hard rock this joint!
Hard
I put the world on my shoulder
Don't worry, I feel no pain
I'm down on the floor, but you can be sure
I'm standing up once again
Don't bother you with my troubles
Just try to walk in my shoes
I'll keep filling up this bottle
With energy that's pouring just all over me
Sometimes I feel like a boxer
Well, I can take all the heat
You knock me down, but next time around
I'll be back on my feet
You're killing me with your troubles
It's always just the same old blues
You know I keep filling up this bottle
With energy that's pouring over you and me
Hard rockin' the place
Wherever we go, whatever it takes
Hard rockin' the place
We rock this joint and fade away
Hard rock this joint!
Hard rock this joint!
Hard rock this joint!
Hard
I put the world on my shoulder
And carry on all the way
I have a laugh, just can't get enough
There's always sun after rain
I keep filling up this bottle
'Cause I'm running empty soon
Oh yeah, here comes double trouble
Your energy is pouring just all over me
Hard rockin' the place
Wherever we go, whatever it takes
Hard rockin' the place
We rock this joint and fade away
Hard rockin' the place
Wherever we go, whatever it takes
Hard rockin' the place
We walk this road on the way
Hard rock this joint!
Hard rock this joint!
Hard rock this joint!
