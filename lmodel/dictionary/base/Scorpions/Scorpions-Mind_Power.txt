<song artist="Scorpions" title="Mind_Power">
Don't use your fist, use your brain
Don't use your fist, use your brain
Don't use your fist, use your brain
Don't use your fist, use your brain
Mind power, every hour, any minute, every day
Mind power, every hour, any minute, every day
So when you walk through the door
Is this the bottom word
The fortress of violence will fall
When the tide will turn
Don't use your fist, use your brain
Don't use your fist, use your brain
Don't use your fist, use your brain
Don't use your fist, use your brain
Mind power, every hour, any minute, every day
Mind power, every hour, any minute, every day
Is there a place you belong
When there is no love
The light that shines is so strong
When you come out of the dark
Yeah
We're living in a violent world
It makes our heart just freeze
Let's melt the ice with heart and soul
To heal a world that bleeds
(to heal a world that bleeds)

Don't use your fist, use your brain
Don't use your fist, use your brain
Don't use your fist, use your brain
Don't use your fist, use your brain
Mind power, every hour, any minute, every day
Mind power, every hour, any minute, every day
Mind power, every hour, any minute, every day
Mind power, every hour, any minute, every day
So when you walk through the door
Is this the bottom word
The fortress of violence will fall
When the tide will turn
So when you walk through the door
You can make it too
The fortress of violence will fall
If you want it to
Don't use your fist, use your brain
Don't use your fist, use your brain
Don't use your fist, use your brain
Don't use your fist, use your brain
Mind power, every hour, any minute, every day
Mind power, every hour, any minute, every day
Mind power, every hour, any minute, every day
Mind power, every hour, any minute, every day
Mind power, every hour, any minute, every day
Mind power, every hour, any minute, every day
Mind power
