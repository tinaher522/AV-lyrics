<song artist="Scorpions" title="Partners_In_Crime">
Even though we ain't no brothers
We follow the spiritual light
It's thicker than blood 
And harder than stone
We overcome stormy waters
Climb up the mountain so high
The day will come
When we bring it home
We're on some kind of a mission
For what we believe in our hearts
We're reaching out for our visions
'Cause we are partners in crime
Any time
Partners in crime
Under crimson sky
We ride the thunder, the lightning
To find the key to our faith
We keep searching for
The peace of mind (yeah)
He walked the road of a warrior
Stand up and do what it takes
'Cause these things life
Ain't worth a dime
Out in a world of confusion
Searching for light in the dark
We turn the wheel of illusion
'Cause we are partners in crime
Any time
Partners in crime
under crimson sky
We hold on to what money can't buy
'Cause friends will be friends
Till the day that we die
We go on until the end of time
Once you're in
You just can't get away
Even though we ain't no brothers
We follow the spiritual light
It's thicker than blood 
And harder than stone
We overcome stormy waters
Climb up the mountain so high
The day will come
When we bring it home
We're on some kind of a mission
For what we believe in our hearts
We're reaching out for our visions
'Cause we are partners in crime
Any time
Partners in crime
Under crimson sky
Partners in crime
Any time
Partners in crime
Under crimson sky
