Girl I , Dont think of you 
At Least thats what I try to do
ah
And I just miss those days , our secret little place
oh well , ah
But I'll be there anytime your heart is desperate just to love someone
I want you to call me now
Cos It feels so good to be your lover 
When My Lips are kissing you all over
And No Matter what I do I Cant get you off my mind
I Just want this night to last forever, it cannot get any better
In my life..
No I Dont feel the pain
My world went upside down , Insane
ah
And I Dont miss those nights
no , maybe thats a lie as well
ah
Still I'll be there anytime your heart is desperate just to love someone
I want you to call me now
Cos it feels  so good to be your lover
When my lips are kissing you all over
And No matter what i Do i cant get you off my mind
I Just, want this night to last forever
It cannot get any better
In My Life
(Its where i'll be alone ... In My Life... yeah)
And I'll be there, anytime your heart is desperate just to love someone
I want you to call me now
Cos it feels so good to be your lover
When my lips are kissing you all over
And no matter what i do, I Cant get you off my mind
I Just, want this night to last forever
It cannot get any better
In My Life , In My Life
I Just , want this night to last forever, it cannot get any better
In My Life . . .
There's nothing left to do , but to say those words to you
Oh , Yes , I Do
