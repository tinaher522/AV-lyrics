<song artist="Scorpions" title="Tin_Soldier">
I'm a little tin soldier
That wants to jump into your fire
You are a look in your eye
A dream passing by in the sky
I don't understand
All I need is treat me like a man
'Cause I ain't no child take me like I am
I got to know that I belong to you
Do anything that you want to do
Sing any song that you want me to sing to you
All I need is your whispered hello
Smiles melting the snow nothing heard
Your eyes are deeper than time
Say a love that won't rhyme without words
So now I've lost my way
I need help to show me things to say
Give me your love before mine fades away
I got to know that I belong to you
Do anything that you want to do
Sing any song that you want me to sing to you
Oh no no no
I don't need no aggravation
I just got to make you my occupation
I got to know that I belong to you
Do anything that you want to do
Sing any song that you want me to sing to you
I got to know that I belong to you
Do anything that you want to do
Sing any song that you want me to sing to you
I don't need no aggravation
I just got to make you my occupation
I don't need no aggravation.
