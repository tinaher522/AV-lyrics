<song artist="Scorpions" title="As_Soon_As_The_Good_Times_Roll">
If you feel real sad somtimes
Caught in bad vibrations
And it seems you've lost your drive
And your destination
If you feel that life's passing by, passing by
Catch the train of better times
Rock tonight
Hard times go
As soon as the good times roll
Hard times go
As soon as the good times roll
If you feel that all your life
Is packed with complications
And almost everything you try
Ends up in new frustrations
If you feel that life's passing by, passing by
Catch the train of better times
Rock tonight
Hard times go
As soon as the good times roll
Hard times go
As soon as the good times roll
