<song artist="Scorpions" title="All_Night_Long">
Jack it in none of them
He'll get along
Some like the violin, some like the horn
She can't play on and my mind's goin' round
Hot lovin' woman is back in town
Well just to make me feel alright
All night long, oh yeah
But just to make me feel alright
All night long
Jack it in none of them
He'll get along
Some like the violin, some like the horn
She can't play on and my mind's goin' round
Hot lovin' woman is back in town
Oh, yeah
Well just to make me feel alright
All night long, oh yeah
But just to make me feel alright
All night long
