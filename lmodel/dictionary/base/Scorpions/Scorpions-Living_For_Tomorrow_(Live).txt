<song artist="Scorpions" title="Living_For_Tomorrow_(Live)">
Ready to go on? Here's a song for you.
It ain't performed anywhere else before
We've been few times here in Leningrad
But you know, this is a live recording tonight
Alright, so let me hear you Leningrad!
Alright, to give you an idea what this song is all about
I'll try. I'll try to translate it in your language, alright?
Here we go...
I'm still living for tomorrow
I'm living for today!
Let's make this world a better place to live
Stop today, stop the kill
Love's can be bold to get it done
To stop the pain of a killin' gun
And even if you say we're gonna die today
I'm still living for tomorrow
I'm living for today
'Cause love will find a way my friend 
Whatever, it will change
I'm still living for tomorrow
I'm living for today
Why don't we try today my friend
to make this world a better place?
Let's make this life a better life to live
Stop the hate, learn to forgive!
Even power can kill the human race
If we give life a human face
A human face..
And even if you say we're gonna die today
I'm still living for tomorrow
I'm living for today
'Cause love will find a way my friend
Whatever, it will change
I'm still living for tomorrow
I'm living for today
Why don't we try today my friend
to make this world a better place?
A better place..
And even if you say we're gonna die today
I'm still living for tomorrow
I'm living for today
'Cause love will find a way my friend
Whatever, it will change
I'm still living for tomorrow
I'm living for today
Why don't we try today my friend
to make this world a better place?
Come on Leningrad!
