<song artist="Scorpions" title="In_The_Flesh">
"Whoo hoo!, Are You Ready?"
So you thought you might like to
Go to the show
To feel the warm thrill of confusion
That space cadet glow
Tell me is something eluding you, Sunshine?
Is this not what you expected to see?
If you wanna find out what's behind these cold eyes
You'll just have to blow your way through this disguise
"Lights!"
"Roll the Sound Effects"
"Drop It. Drop It"
"Drop it On Them!"
