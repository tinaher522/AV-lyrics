<song artist="Scorpions" title="321">
Time is a wicked master
Put your life into its hand
Close your eyes and it will crush you
Rage only spins you faster
It's a curse born unto man
Turns your dreams into disaster
Save me
Cause the world's gonna stop
Baby 3 2 1
Are you ready to rock
Come on and wake me
The final curtain will drop
Baby 3 2 1
Are you ready to rock
Are you ready to rock
Are you ready to rock
Are you ready to rock
Tonight
Lies it's the truth I'm after
Let me find it in your eyes
Quick before the moment dies
Cries in a sea of laughter
Weepin' gently in my soul
Love's the only thing that matters
Save me
Cause the world's gonna stop
Baby 3 2 1
Are you ready to rock
Come on and wake me
The final curtain will drop
Baby 3 2 1
Are you ready to rock
Are you ready to rock
Are you ready to rock
Are you ready to rock
Are you ready to rock
Are you ready to rock
Are you ready to rock
Are you ready to rock
Tonight
10... 9... 8... 7... 6... 5... 4...
3 2 1
Come on and save me
Cause the world's gonna stop
Baby 3 2 1
Are you ready to rock
Come on and wake me
The final curtain will drop
Baby 3 2 1
Are you ready to rock
Come on and shake me
Cause we're in for a shock
Baby 3 2 1
We're fallin' down from the top
Come on and take me
We're goin straight to the top
Baby 3 2 1
Are you ready to rock
Are you ready to rock
Are you ready to rock
Are you ready to rock
Are you ready to rock
Are you ready to rock
Are you ready to rock
Are you ready to rock
Tonight
