<song artist="Scorpions" title="We_Built_This_House">
Love is the glue that holds us together
Faith and believing is the key, this door of forever
Baby You and I
We're every reason on earth
Now and again it's always us against the world
Against the world
When the rain fell
And the flood came
And the wind blew hard like a hammer on these walls
We didn't crack, or break or fall
We built this house on a rock
This house on a rock
And there is a time to face stormy weather
But we are always standing strong, a lifetime together
Baby You and I
We don't regret anything
Now it's the two of us again against the wind
Against the wind
When the rain fell
And the flood came
And the wind blew hard like a hammer on these walls
We didn't crack or break or fall
We built this house on a rock
This house on a rock
Brick by brick we have set it up
Oh man if these walls could talk
Bit by bit based it on trust
We gave it all we got
When the rain fell
and the flood came
and the wind blew hard like a hammer on these walls
We didn't crack or break or fall
We built this house on a rock
This house on a rock
We built this house on a rock
