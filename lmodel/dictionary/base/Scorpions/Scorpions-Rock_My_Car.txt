<song artist="Scorpions" title="Rock_My_Car">
Rock, rock, rock my car
Let's push the pedal down to the metal!
Rock, rock, rock my car
Let's push the pedal down to the metal!
Yeah!
The ultimate pleasure is waiting for me
You wanna join in for a drive
The engine is roaring, I double the speed
In love with the fast lane of life
A rush to the head, I'm changing the gear
Let's get the power unchained
My heart's beating faster, because I can hear
The highway is calling my name
Fasten your seatbelts
Ready to go
We gonna have fun tonight
Rock, rock, rock my car
Let's push the pedal down to the metal!
Rock, rock, rock my car
Let's push the pedal down to the metal!
Yeah!
The maximum power, it can't be too fast
And when the morning arrives
WeÂ´re starting all over, no future no past
Forever big city nights
Put on your helmet
Ready to go
We gonna have fun tonight
Rock, rock, rock my car
Let's push the pedal down to the metal!
Rock, rock, rock my car
Let's push the pedal down to the metal!
Yeah!
Rock, rock
Rock, rock
Rock, rock, rock my car
Let's push the pedal down to the metal!
Rock, rock, rock my car
Let's push the pedal down to the metal!
Rock, rock, rock my car
Let's push the pedal down to the metal!
Rock, rock, rock my car
Let's push the pedal down to the metal!
Yeah!
