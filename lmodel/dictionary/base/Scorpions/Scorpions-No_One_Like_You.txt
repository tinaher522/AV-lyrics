<song artist="Scorpions" title="No_One_Like_You">
Girl, it's been a long time that we've been apart
Much too long for a man who needs love
I've missed you since I've been away
Babe, wasn't easy to leave you alone
It's getting harder now that I'm gone
If I had the choice, I would stay
There's no one like you
I can't wait for the nights with you
I imagine the things we'd do
I just wanna be loved by you
No one like you
I can't wait for the nights with you
I imagine the things we'd do
I just wanna be loved by you
Girl, there are really no words strong enough
To describe all my longing for love
I don't want my feelings restrained
Ooh babe, I just need you like never before
Just imagine you'd come through this door
To take all my sorrows away
There's no one like you
I can't wait for the nights with you
I imagine the things we'd do
I just wanna be loved by you
No one like you
I can't wait for the nights with you
I imagine the things we'd do
I just wanna be loved by you
No one like you
I can't wait for the nights with you
I imagine the things we'd do
I just wanna be loved by you
No one like you
I can't wait for the nights with you
I imagine the things we'd do
I just wanna be loved by you
