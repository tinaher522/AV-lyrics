<song artist="Scorpions" title="Catch_Your_Luck_And_Play">
I saw her walking to the station
Up for a ride on the crazy train
In her eyes I saw a world of passion
So much lust, so deep inside to be unchained
Lost my heart for a little runaway
Full of love and little lies
We don't care about anything
There's a brand new day tomorrow
We go hey (you) live (now)
Love will come your way
I play my vintage six string
And there's a road to follow
We go hey (you) live (now)
Catch your luck and play
I turned around, heard her calling
I was thrilled in so many ways
She ate me up and I was falling
And I was lost not to be found without a trace
Take my heart you little runaway
Full of love and little lies
We don't care about anything
There's a brand new day tomorrow
We go hey (you) live (now)
Love will come your way
I play my vintage six string
And there's a road to follow
We go hey (you) live (now)
Catch your luck and play
We don't care about anything
And we go hey (you) live (now)
Love will come your way
I play my vintage six string
Yeah we go hey (you) live (now)
Catch your luck and play
We don't care about anything
There's a brand new day tomorrow
We go hey (you) live (now)
Love will come your way
I play my vintage six string
And there's a road to follow
We go hey (you) live (now)
Catch your luck and play
(Catch your luck and play)
