<song artist="Scorpions" title="You_And_I">
I lose control because of you babe
I lose control when you look at me like this
There's something in your eyes that is sayin' tonight
I'm not a child anymore, life has opened the door
To a new exciting life
I lose control when I'm close to you, babe
I lose control, don't look at me like this
There's something in your eyes, is this love at first sight?
Like a flower that grows, life just wants you to know
All the secrets of life
It's all written down in your lifelines
It's written down inside your heart
You and I just have a dream
To find our love a place
Where we can hide away
You and I, we're just made
To love each other now
Forever and a day
I lose control because of you babe
I lose control, don't look at me like this
There's something in your eyes that is sayin' tonight
I'm so curious for more just like never before
In my innocent life
It's all written down in your lifelines
Yeah, it's written down inside your heart
You and I just have a dream
To find our love a place
Where we can hide away
You and I, we're just made
To love each other now
Forever and a day
Time stands still
When days of innocence are falling for the night
I love you girl I always will
I swear i'm there for you till the day I'll die
Yeah, you and I just have a dream
To find our love a place
Where we can hide away
You and I, we're just made
To love each other now
Forever and a day
You and I (You and I) just have a dream
To find our love a place
Where we can hide away
You and I, (You and I) we're just made
To love each other now
Forever and a day
