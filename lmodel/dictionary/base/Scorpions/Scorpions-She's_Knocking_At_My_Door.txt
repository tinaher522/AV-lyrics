<song artist="Scorpions" title="She's_Knocking_At_My_Door">
She's knocking at my door
That little angel knows the score
She's knocking at my door
But I won't let her out no more
I want a piece of that pie
She's driving me completely wild
She's giving me a private dance
She's playing with my confidence
The way she's coming down the stairs
Makes me surrender just right there
This girl is out of this world
Heaven must be a place on earth
She's knocking at my door
That little angel knows the score
She's knocking at my door
But I won't let her out no more
She's like a shot of adrenaline
She made me fly with broken wings
With nothing but the radio on
Her body is the song I want
She's knocking at my door
That little angel knows the score
She's knocking at my door
But I won't let her out no more
The light is on but no one's home tonight
We lock the door, we turn the key
And throw it right outside
Come on and set me free
If you had candy once before
For you keep coming back for more
She's got the sweetest touch of all
The longest legs that I recall
Before she leaves she turns around
The elevator takes her down
She says oh well the city rocks
I go to sleep but then it knocks
She's knocking at my door
That little angel knows the score
She's knocking at my door
But I won't let her out no more
