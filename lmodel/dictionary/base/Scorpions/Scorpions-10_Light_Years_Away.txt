<song artist="Scorpions" title="10_Light_Years_Away">
In a run down bed and breakfast
A room with a view, across the river
I tried to loose the claustrophobia
Opened up and find Utopia, Utopia
There's no more denying
As my mind go flying
10 light years away to save my soul
10 light years away to change it all
Whatever it may take I gotta try again
Girl it's time to start over
10 light years away
I'd been watching the reflection
Of a bamboo in the shade, when I saw her
A very hot day in Havana
In a midnight blue lagoon
Sunshine get exciting
I knew she was hiding
10 light years away so take me home
10 light years away to change it all
Help me find today It's been way too long
Girl it's time to start over
10 light years away
There's no more denying
As my mind go flying
10 light years away to save my soul
10 light years away to change it all
Whatever it may take I gotta try again
Girl it's time to start over
10 light years away so take me home
10 light years away to change it all
Help me find today It's been way too long
Girl it's time to start over
10 light years away
