<song artist="Scorpions" title="The_Sails_Of_Charon">
Dark night, there is no light
In the realm of the black magic man
Souls flight into the cold blight
Of the destroyer's magic land
Poor man, whose spirits are stronger
They're the ones who will reign
Your strugglings are in vain
Blind man, you're sucking your own blood
Soon black magic's dying
You'd better start crying
Blind man, you're sucking your own blood
Soon black magic's dying
You'd better start crying
Burn out your evil desire
The dark king's kingdom is
Made out of mire
Burn out your evil desire
The dark king's kingdom is
Made out of mire
Keep on for the kingdom of light
There is no darkness, there is no night
