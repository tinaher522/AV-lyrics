<song artist="Scorpions" title="I've_Got_To_Be_Free">
You're burning my heart
you're burning my mind
you're spoiling my art
you're wasting my time
No taste in your actions 
no taste in your line
no truth or direction
no true love of mine
You say you wanna be a superstar 
don't give a damn how to get that far 
you say you wanna ride a diamond car 
but I don't like your fat cigar.
Hey, hey, hey don't you wanna see 
I'm not your stepping stone 
hey, hey, hey I've got to be free 
so leave my life alone
You're in love with success 
you're spilling my wine 
don't follow my tracks, babe 
you ways are not mine
Your main god is money
you're wasting my life 
I'm not your Bugs Bunny
and you're not my wife
You say you only do it for our best 
but you don't wanna see what I detest 
you think me crack-brained 
that I'm gonna leave your show 
but you can't see what I see 
so let me go.
