<song artist="Scorpions" title="Bridge_To_Heaven">
Sailing home on silver wings
Sailing home where freedom rings
The night is cold and dark December
Long is the road and we must walk alone
Until our hearts will melt the sky
While angels wings are passing by
We're sailing home on wings of heaven
We're sailing for the gates of seven
There is a word we must remember
Where is the love to melt that heart of stone
Yes, as the sun will melt the night
We shall be found with keys of light
Yes we shall build a bridge to heaven
Together we will find the road to sky
Yes we shall build a bridge to heaven
From mother earth right on to paradise
And when our hearts will melt the sky
We shall have found the keys of life
Yes we shall build a bridge to heaven
Together we will drink the wine of sky
And as the sun will melt the night
We shall be one as morning light
Shall be one with the dawn
