<song artist="Scorpions" title="Sting_In_The_Tail">
Save me from myself before I’m going down
My world went kind of crazy spinning ‘round’n‘round
My body’s in a mess from head to toe
Got nothing to lose and nowhere to go
I’m driving out of town just follow my heart
I think I’m gonna be a rock’n’roll star
The girls would go mad I’d give ‘em all I can give
If I had a cheap guitar and one dirty riff
Hail hail a sting in the tail
Hail hail a sting in the tail
Hail hail a sting in the tail
Hail hail a sting in the tail
Rocking night after night day after day
There’s plenty of love and no escape
Life’s screaming and rolling like a monster train
Destination to nowhere I won’t be late
Jo Jo I got to go
Here comes another show
Hail hail a sting in the tail
Hail hail a sting in the tail
Hail hail a sting in the tail
Hail hail a sting in the tail
