<song artist="The_Police" title="Synchronicity_I">
With one breath, with one flow
You will know
Synchronicity
A sleep trance, a dream dance
A shared romance
Synchronicity
A connecting principle
Linked to the invisible
Almost imperceptible
Something inexpressible
Science insusceptible
Logic so inflexible
Causally connectable
Nothing is invincible
If we share this nightmare
We can dream
Spiritus mundi
If you act, as you think
The missing link
Synchronicity
A connecting principle
Linked to the invisible
Almost imperceptible
Something inexpressible
Science insusceptible
Logic so inflexible
Causally connectable
Nothing is invincible
We know you, they know me
Extrasensory
Synchronicity
A star fall, a phone call
It joins all
Synchronicity
A connecting principle
Linked to the invisible
Almost imperceptible
Something inexpressible
Science insusceptible
Logic so inflexible
Causally connectable
Nothing is invincible
It's so deep, it's so wide
You're inside
Synchronicity
Effect without a cause
Subatomic laws, scientific pause
Synchronicity, synchronicity
Synchronicity, synchronicity
Synchronicity, synchronicity
Synchronicity, synchronicity
Synchronicity, synchronicity
