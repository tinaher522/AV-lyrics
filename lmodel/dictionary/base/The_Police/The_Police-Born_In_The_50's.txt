<song artist="The_Police" title="Born_In_The_50's">
We were born
Born in the fifties
Born
Born in the fifties
Born
Born in the fifties
Born
Born in the fifties
My mother cried
When President Kennedy died
She said it was the communists
But I knew better
Would they drop the bomb on us
While we made love on the beach
We were the class they couldn't teach
'Cause we knew better
We were born
Born in the fifties
Born
Born in the fifties
Born
Born in the fifties
Born
Born in the fifties
They screamed
When The Beatles sang
And we laughed when the king fell down the stairs
Oh, they should've known better
Oh, we hated our aunts
And we messed in our pants
And we lost our faith and prayed to the TV
Oh, we should've known better
We were born
Born in the fifties
Born
Born in the fifties
Born
Born in the fifties
Born
Born in the fifties
We freeze like statues on the pages of history
Living was never like this when we took all those G.C.E.'s
Oh, you opened the door for us
And then you turned to dust
You don't understand us, so don't reprimand us
We're taking the future, we don't need no teacher
Born
Born in the fifties
Born
Born in the fifties
Born
Born in the fifties
Born
Born in the fifties
Born
Born in the fifties
Born
Born in the fifties
Born
Born in the fifties
Born
Born in the fifties
