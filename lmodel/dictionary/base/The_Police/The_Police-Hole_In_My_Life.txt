<song artist="The_Police" title="Hole_In_My_Life">
There's a hole
In my life
There's a hole
In my life
Shadow in my heart
Is tearing me apart
Or maybe it's just something
In my stars
There's a hole
In my life
There's a hole
In my life
Be a happy man
I try the best I can
Or maybe I'm just looking
For too much
There's something missing from my life
Cuts me open like a knife
It leaves me vulnerable
I have this disease
I shake like an incurable
God help me please
Whoa-oh, there's a hole
In my life
There's a hole
In my life
Yeah, yeah....
There's something missing from my life
Cuts me open like a knife
It leaves me vulnerable
I have this disease
I shake like an incurable
God help me please
Whoa-oh, there's a hole
In my life
There's a hole
In my life
There's a hole
In my life
There's a hole...
