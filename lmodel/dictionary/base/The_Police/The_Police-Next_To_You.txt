<song artist="The_Police" title="Next_To_You">
I can't stand it for another day
When you live so many miles away
Nothing here is gonna make me stay
You took me over, let me find a way
I sold my house, I sold my motor, too
All I want is to be next to you
I'd rob a bank, maybe steal a plane
You took me over, think I'm goin' insane
What can I do?
All I want is to be next to you
What can I do?
All I want is to be next to you
I've had a thousand girls or maybe more
But I've never felt like this before
But I just don't know what's come over me
You took me over, take a look at me
What can I do?
All I want is to be next to you
What can I do?
All I want is to be next to you
All I want is to be next to you
All I want is to be next to you
All I want is to be next to you
Talked to my doctor, he said give it time
Got this feeling gonna lose my mind
When all it is is just a love affair
You took me over, baby, take me there
What can I do?
All I want is to be next to you
What can I do?
All I want is to be next to you
What can I do?
All I want is to be next to you
What can I do?
All I want is to be next to you
All I want is to be next to you
What can I do?
All I want is to be next to you
