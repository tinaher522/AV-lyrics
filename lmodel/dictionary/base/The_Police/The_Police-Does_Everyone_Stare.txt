<song artist="The_Police" title="Does_Everyone_Stare">
I change my clothes ten times
Before I take you on a date
I'm in a cold sweat
My panic makes me late
I know you never asked for this
I know my shots will always miss
I know my shots will always miss
Does everyone stare this way at you?
I only look this way at you
I change my clothes ten times
Before I take you on a date
I get the heebie-jeebies
And my panic makes me late
I break into a cold sweat reaching for the phone
I let it ring twice before I chicken out
And decide you're not at home
Does everyone stare the way I do?
I only stare this way at you
I never noticed the size of my feet
Till I kicked you in the shins
Will you ever forgive me
For the shape I'm in
For the shape I'm in
Does everyone stare the way I do?
I only stare this way at you
I want to write you a sonnet
But I don't know where to start
I'm so used to laughing
At the things in my heart
Last of all I'm sorry
'Cause you never asked for this
I can see I'm not your type
And my shots will always miss
Aways miss
Does everyone stare the way I do?
I only stare this way at you
Does everyone stare the way I do?
I only stare this way at you...
