<song artist="The_Police" title="O_My_God">
Everyone I know is lonely
And God's so far away
And my heart belongs to no one
So now sometimes I pray
Take the space between us
Fill it up some way
Take the space between us
Fill it up, fill it up
O my God, you take the biscuit
Treating me this way
Expecting me to treat you well
No matter what you say
How can I turn the other cheek
It's black and bruised and torn
I've been waiting
Since the day that I was born
Fill it up, fill it up, fill it up
Take the space between us
Fill it up some way
Take the space between us
Fill it up, fill it up
Fill it up
Fill it up
Fill it up
Fill it up
Fat man in his garden
Thin man at his gate
My God, you must be sleeping
Wake up, it's much too late
Take the space between us
Fill it up some way
Take the space between us
Fill it up, fill it up
Fill it up
Fill it up
Fill it up
Fill it up
Do I have to tell the story
Of a thousand rainy days
Since we first met?
It's a big enough umbrella
But it's always me that ends up getting wet
