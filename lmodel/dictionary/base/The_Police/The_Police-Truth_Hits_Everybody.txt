<song artist="The_Police" title="Truth_Hits_Everybody">
Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh
Sleep lay behind me like a broken ocean
Strange waking dreams before my eyes unfold
You lay there sleeping like an open doorway
I stepped outside myself and felt so cold
Take a look at my new toy
It'll blow your head in two, oh boy
Truth hits everybody
Truth hits everyone (Whoa-oh-oh)
Truth hits everybody (Whoa-oh-oh)
Truth hits everyone (Whoa-oh-oh)
Truth hits everybody (Whoa-oh-oh)
Truth hits everyone
I thought about it and my dream was broken
I clutch at images like dying breath
And I don't want to make a fuss about it
The only certain thing in life is death
Take a look at my new toy
It'll blow your head in two, oh boy
Truth hits everybody
Truth hits everyone (Whoa-oh-oh)
Truth hits everybody (Whoa-oh-oh)
Truth hits everyone (Whoa-oh-oh)
Truth hits everybody (Whoa-oh-oh)
Truth hits everyone
Where you want to be
Won't you ever see
Ooh
Truth hits everybody
Truth hits everyone (Whoa-oh-oh)
Truth hits everybody (Whoa-oh-oh)
Truth hits everyone (Whoa-oh-oh)
Truth hits everybody (Whoa-oh-oh)
Truth hits everyone (Whoa-oh-oh)
Truth hits everybody (Whoa-oh-oh)
Truth hits everyone (Whoa-oh-oh)
Truth hits everybody (Whoa-oh-oh)
Truth hits everyone, now!
