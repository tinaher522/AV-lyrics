<song artist="The_Police" title="It's_Alright_For_You">
Wake up, make up
Bring it up, shake up
Stand by, don't cry
Watching while the world dies
Big car, movie star
Hot tip, go far
Blind date, too late
Take a bus, don't wait
It's alright for you
It's alright for you
It's alright for you
For you and you and you and you and you
It's alright for you
It's alright for you
It's alright for you
For you and you and you
Limp wrist, tight fist
Contact, no twist
Black dress, no mess
People want no less
No less
Stand by, don't cry
Watching while the world dies
Three lane, fast lane
Standing in the cold rain
It's alright for you
It's alright for you
It's alright for you
For you and you and you and you and you
It's alright for you
It's alright for you
It's alright for you
For you
Headlight, high life
Can't sleep, goodnight
Uptight, big fight
Big deal, too right
Too right
Big town, don't drown
Jump back, turn around
No life, flick knife
Finish off my life
It's alright for you
It's alright for you
It's alright for you
For you and you and you and you and you
It's alright for you
It's alright for you
It's alright for you
For you
