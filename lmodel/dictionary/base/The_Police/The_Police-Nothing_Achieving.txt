<song artist="The_Police" title="Nothing_Achieving">
My daddy's boots don't fit me
'Cause I'm bigger than him
He says I make him sick now
I'm bigger than him
They say there's nothing worth achieving
All your dreams are just deceiving
You've locked the doors on your good living
And you told me to wait
You've got me backed into a corner
You're making me hate
I say there's nothing worth achieving
All your dreams are just deceiving
They say there's nothing worth achieving
All your dreams are just deceiving
Throwing stones that are reeling
From a reasonable light
You muscle in where when I party
Ready to fight
I say there's nothing worth achieving
All your dreams are just deceiving
Nothing, nothing, nothing
