<song artist="The_Police" title="Fall_Out">
I never follow leaders
I got my own machine
And I've paid my dues all along
Always set for breaking
When I'm missing other people
'Cause I knew that I was really alone
Fall out
Fall out with all the leaders and gangs
Fall out
Fall out with all the leaders and gangs
I saw my education
It was my indoctrination
Just to be another parking machine
Always set for breaking
When I'm missing other people
'Cause I knew that I was not very clean
Fall out
Fall out with all the leaders and gangs
Fall out
Fall out with all the leaders and gangs
Fall out
Fall out with all the leaders and gangs
Fall out
Fall out with all the leaders and gangs
Fall out
