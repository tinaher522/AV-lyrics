<song artist="Grimes" title="Venus_Fly">
Hey, oh why you looking at me? (Against the music)
Hey, oh why you looking at me? (Baby I can use it)
Why you looking at me now?
Why you looking at me again?
What if I pulled my teeth
Cut my hair underneath my chin?
Wrap my curls all around the world
Throw my pearls all across the floor
Feeling my beat like a sniper girl
(Cause I want it more)
Hey, what about me?
Oh, why you looking at me?
Oh, why you looking at me?
(Against the music)
Hey, what about me?
Oh, why you looking at me?
Oh, why you looking at me?
(Baby I can use it)
Kitty, kitty, kitty cat
Why you always doing that?
Why you always talking smack?
Yeah, Grimes got my back
Kitty, kitty, kitty cat
Why you always call it black?
Why you always talking smack?
Yeah, Grimes
Why you looking at me now?
Why you looking at me again?
What if I pulled my teeth
Cut my hair underneath my chin?
Wrap my curls all around the world
Throw my pearls all across the floor
Feeling my beat like a sniper girl
(Cause I want it more)
Hey, what about me?
Oh, why you looking at me?
Oh, why you looking at me?
(Against the music)
Hey, what about me?
Oh, why you looking at me?
Oh, why you looking at me?
(Baby I can use it)
Hit the floor
What about?
Again
Hey, what about me?
Why you looking at me?
Again
Again
Hey, oh why you looking at me?
Oh, why you looking at me?
Baby I can use it
