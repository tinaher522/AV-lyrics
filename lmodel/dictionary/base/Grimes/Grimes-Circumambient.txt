<song artist="Grimes" title="Circumambient">
Oh baby I can't say
That everything is okay
And I have a problem
And I don't know where to start from
But baby I can do
Anything that helps you
I'm looking to the phone
And you know
I'm a
I'm a into the
I'm a
I'm a
I'm a into the
I'm a
Ha ha ha ha
Ha ha ha ha
Oh baby I can't say
That everything is okay
Cause I have a problem
And I don't know how to solve them
Oh baby I can't do
Anything without you
Cause I ain't looking
And you know, you know
You gotta have a
I'm a
I'm a into the
I'm a
I'm a
I'm a into the
I'm a
