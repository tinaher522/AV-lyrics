<song artist="Grimes" title="Infinite_❤_Without_Fulfillment">
I'll leave you if you want to
(It's all about my own
It's all about my own)
I'll be with you it's all I want to? (x3)
I'll leave you if you want to!
I'll leave you, if you want to!
I'll leave you if you want to!
I'll leave you, if you want to!
I'll leave you if you want to!
I'll leave you, if you want to!
Our infinite love!
