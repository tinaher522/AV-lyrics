<song artist="Grimes" title="Flesh_Without_Blood">
You claw, you fight, you lose
Got a doll that looks just like you
Remember when we used to say
"I love you" almost every day
I saw the light in you
Going out as I closed our window
You never liked me anyway
Hey yeah
Hey yeah
Hey, I don't see the light I saw in you before
And now I don't, and now I don't
And now I don't care anymore
(Now I don't care anymore)
Baby, believe me
And you had every chance, you destroyed everything that you know
(Uncontrollable)
If you don't need me
Just let me go
You hate, you bite, you lose
After all, I just don't like you
It's nice that you say you like me
- But only conditionally
Your voice, it had the perfect glow
It got lost when you gave it up though
'Cause you want money, you want fame
Hey yeah
Hey yeah
Hey, I don't see the light I saw in you before
And now I don't, and now I don't
And now I don't care anymore
(And now I don't care anymore)
Baby, believe me
And you had every chance, you destroyed everything that you know
(Uncontrollable)
If you don't need me
Just let me go
(Hey, hey, sing along, baby
Then your heart beats
Bleeds underground now)
Hey, hey, oh no
(Now I don't care anymore)
Baby, believe me
And you had every chance, you destroyed everything that you know
(Uncontrollable)
If you don't need me
Just let me go
Baby, believe me
And you had every chance, you destroyed everything that you know
(Uncontrollable)
If you don't need me
Just let me go
Ah
(Uncontrollable)
Ah
Ah
Ah
