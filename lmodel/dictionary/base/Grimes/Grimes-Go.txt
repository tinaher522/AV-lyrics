<song artist="Grimes" title="Go">
Dreams, they feel like memories when I dream of you
Time won't stay, it'll stretch itself out from a minute to days
And I'd like to think that we don't dream to win it all
'Cos I've been here
Living up, giving up
When I go, can I go with you, you?
When I go, can I go with...
Go, go, go, go, go with
Go with
Go, go, go, go, go
(Blood diamonds)
Happy scenes, a stupid dream when I dream of you
They don't stay, it might all be delusion but I couldn't say
And I'd like to think that we don't dream just to dream it all
'Cos I've been here
In love, give it up
When I go, can I go with you, you?
When I go, can I go with...
Go, can I go with
Go, can I go with
Go, can I go with
Go, can I go with
Go, can I go with
Go, can I go with
You
