<song artist="Grimes" title="Life_In_The_Vivid_Dream">
I could live in the world just like a stranger
I could tell you the truth or a lie
I could tell you that people are good in the end
But why, why would I?
Angels will cry when it's raining
Tears that are no longer clean
What do you mean?
What do you mean, it's all gone?
I've waited here so long
Bye to the people
They, they do nothing
Now that you're missing something
You wanna leave the world with me
You wanna leave
