(My heart will never feel 
never see
Will never know
Oh, heart
And then it falls
And then I fall
And then I know)
My heart will never feel
Will never see 
Will never know 
Oh, heart 
And then it falls 
And then I fall
And then I know 
My heart will never feel 
Will never see 
Will never know 
Oh, heart 
And then it falls
And then it falls
And then I know
(My, my, my)
Everything, everything
(My, my, my)
(My heart)
Home is Unknown
I am a vagabond 
It’s always different now 
I am the one who falls
My heart will never be 
Will never see 
Will never know 
Oh, heart 
And then it falls
And then it falls
And then I know
We be..Home in the Unknown
Like a vagabond 
Its always different now
Im the one who falls
We be.. Home the unknown
Like a vagabond
its always different now
im the one who falls

Home the Unknown
I am a vagabond
It’s always different now
I am the one that falls
Home the Unknown
I am a vagabond
It’s always different now
I am the one that falls
