Mother
Im reaching out for the dark
Paranoid and I can't decide
And I can't decide on it 
Paranoid and I can't seem to
Can't seem to, oh, begin
Paranoid..but i got my mind -[im going to hell!]
but i got my heart .. [-im going to hell!]
and i got my pride .. [uh huh!]
paranoid and i cant decide [ -im going to hell!, im going to hell!]
if im going to heaven or hell... 
im going to.. oow oow.. ooooww Hell!
im going faster too! I cant wait!
im going faster too
im destined for hell!
i want a perfect pool.. I cant wait!
im going faster too..
im destined for hell!
Im definitely going to hell!

Paranoid and my mind wonders if i been thinking?
Paranoid and i wonder ..have i been thinking?
faster faster the leaves fall down
the sky turns grey and my skin goes dull
paranoid and i wonder..have i been thinking?
Paranoid and I can't decide 
i cant decide on it
paranoid..
And i Can't seem to.. seem to, oh, begin
Paranoid..and i cant decide.. [-im going..ta hell!]
No I can't decide, no i cant decide on it[ -im going to hell!]
paranoid...doo doo dododo do do!.[.im definitely going!]
doo doo do dododo dodo! [-im definitely going..ta hell!] 
 ah doo doo dododo do! [im definitwly going!] 
 doo doo dodododoo!  
 Ah doo doo dododo do do! im definitely going..ta hell!
im definitely going to hell!
