I've been
Oh, I've been waiting destiny
And my heart is here right next to me
And I'm caught waiting in the rain
Oh, I've been waiting destiny
And my heart is here right next to me
And I'm caught waiting in the rain
And I know and I need you in the storm
And I, oh I, oh I
Hey!
Hey hey, you wanna play?
Well, baby I can go and go
And every other day you're running off with so and so
Well, baby I would throw you if I didn't know you but I'm paying for it
Hey hey, you wanna play?
Well, baby I can go and go
And every other day you're running off with so and so
Well, baby I would throw you if I didn't know you but I'm paying for it
Baby I would throw you if I didn't know you, but I'm paying for it
I hold on
And I don't care what you say
But the way it goes it's a happening everyday
(I can see space on the radio)
I hold on
And I don't care what you say
But the way it goes it's a happening everyday
Everyday, everyday, everyday, everyday
Hey hey, you wanna play?
Well, baby I can go and go
And every other day you're running off with so and so
Well, baby I would throw you if I didn't know you but I'm paying for it
Hey hey, you wanna play?
Well, baby I can go and go
And every other day you're running off with so and so
Well, baby I would throw you if I didn't know you but I'm paying for it
Hey hey, you wanna play?
Well, baby I can go and go
And every other day you're running off with so and so
Well, baby I would throw you if I didn't know you but I'm paying for it

Hey hey, you wanna play?
Well, baby I can go and go
And every other day you're running off with so and so
Well, baby I would throw you if I didn't know you but I'm paying for it
(I can see space on the radio)
Baby I would throw you if I didn't know you but I'm paying for it
