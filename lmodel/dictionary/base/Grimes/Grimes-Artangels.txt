Oooh-hooo
Angel baby there is nothing I'd rather do
Than to love you but I know that I will never do
Everything I love becomes everything I knew
So
Tell me anything, anything you want
You're my darling girl
Tell me what's on your mind
Tell me anything, anything you feel like
Anything you feel like
Je comprends, je l'ai dit, c'est la vie
Oh Montréal, pull apart
I don't mind
Running every red light, you were right
Oh Montréal, don't break my heart
I think I love you
I think I love you
I think I love you
I think I love you
I think I love you
Oooh-hooo
Angel baby, you've got me feeling kinda blue
Think I need you and you know the things that I would do
Everything I love is consolation after you
So
Tell me anything, anything you want
You're my darling girl
Tell me what's on your mind
Tell me anything, anything you feel like
Anything you feel like
Je comprends, je l'ai dit, c'est la vie
Oh Montréal, pull apart
I don't mind
Running every red light, you were right
Oh Montréal, don't break my heart
I think I love you
I think I love you
I think I love you
I think I love you
Hoo-ooh hoo, hoo-ooh hoo, hoo-ooh hoo
Hoo-ooh hoo, hoo-ooh hoo, hoo-ooh hoo
I don't need your medicine
Gonna dance all night
I'm high on adrenaline
That's right, that's right, that's right
I don't need your medicine
Gonna dance all night
I'm high on adrenaline
That's right, that's right, that's right
That's right, that's right, that's right
That's right, that's right, that's right
