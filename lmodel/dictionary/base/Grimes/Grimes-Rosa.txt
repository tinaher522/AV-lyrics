<song artist="Grimes" title="Rosa">
Midnight afternoon
Morning comes but not too soon
Ellsy wakes up in my bed
We are separate
Vampires in our nightly wear
I'm no longer happy there
Rosa Rosa Rosa
Oh where is my heart
Rosa Rosa Rosa
Oh where is my heart
I can never tell her
That she is a witch
Sewing up my heart again
Love in equal stitch
Oh I am not in love
I am not in love
I'm not
Oh I am not in love
I am not in love
I'm not
Rosa Rosa Rosa
Where is my heart
Rosa Rosa Rosa
Where are my arms
Morning morning morning
Will wake me up cold
Mourning mourning mourning
Reminds me that I am getting old
