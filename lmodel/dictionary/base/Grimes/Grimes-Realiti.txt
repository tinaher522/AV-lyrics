<song artist="Grimes" title="Realiti">
When we were young, we used to get so close to it
And you were scared and you were beautiful
I wanna peer over the edge and see in death
If we are always the same
Oh, I fear that no life will ever be like this again
Cause your love kept me alive and it made me insane, oh, yeah
There were moments when it seemed okay
(But I go back alone)
Where do you go? Oh, where do you stay?
(I go back alone)
There was a time when the music would play
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, baby, every morning there are mountains to climb
Taking all my time
Oh, when I get up, this is what I see
Welcome to reality
Oh, baby, every morning there are mountains to climb
Taking all my time
Oh, when I get up, this is what I see
Welcome to reality
When we were young, we used to get so close to it
And you were scared and you were beautiful
I wanna peer over the edge and see in death
If we are always the same, oh, yeah
There were moments when it seemed okay
(But I go back alone)
Where do you go? Oh, where do you stay?
(I go back alone)
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh, baby, every morning there are mountains to climb
Taking all my time
Oh, when I get up, this is what I see
Welcome to reality
Oh, baby, every morning there are mountains to climb
Taking all my time
Oh, when I get up, this is what I see
Welcome to reality
Oh, baby, every
(Give me a sign)
Oh, baby, every
(To reality)
Oh, baby, every
(Give me a sign)
Oh, baby, every
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
(Give me a sign)
Oh, baby, every
(Give me a sign)
Oh, baby, every
(Give me a sign)
Oh, baby, every
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh, baby, every
Oh, baby, every
(Give me a sign)
Oh, baby, every
