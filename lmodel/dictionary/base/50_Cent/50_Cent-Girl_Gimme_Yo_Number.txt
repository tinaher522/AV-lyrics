<song artist="50_Cent" title="Girl_Gimme_Yo_Number">
From now on, everybody gon' listen to me, okay?
So I don't care what the fuck I say
If I say somethin' crazy, it's okay
Nigga, you better follow what I'm sayin'
Fuck, nigga, I don't give a fuck
Nigga, if I say I wanna sing New Edition
We all gon' sing New Edition
Yeah, it's 50, it's the Unit
[Incomprehensible] your man is on MySpace
That's why your pretty ass is at my place
A million dollar mansion in solace
Come in your mouth, yeah and on your face
I can't believe she didn't see me comin' on her
Zip my zipper and I went up in a Rover
Had another bitch rollin' up the dojah
Yeah, I'm gettin' head in the drop tonight
So tell me what I gotta do to
Get to fuck her in the future
I come through on the right, we ready to ride
And I'ma come to hit you tonight
And it's cool if you don't want to
But bitch, you a fool if you don't want to
'Coz I guarantee the action would see
You feelin' how it's supposed to be
Girl, gimme yo number
Forget it, I don't need your number
Bitch, climb up in the Hummer
'Coz you're gonna get fucked tonight
Girl, gimme yo number
Forget it, I don't need your number
Bitch, climb up in the Hummer
'Coz you're gonna get fucked tonight
Baby, you say I can't get no pussy
You could hit the highway, right away, it's okay
And if you say I can't have no pussy
I put you out on the highway, right away, it's okay
So tell me what I gotta do to
Get to fuck her in the future
Come in a new Coupe you like, be ready to ride
And I'ma pick you up on time
And it's cool if you don't want to
But bitch, you a fool if you don't want to
'Coz I guarantee that [Incomprehensible]
Will have you feelin' how it's supposed to be
Girl, gimme yo number
Forget it, I don't need your number
Bitch, climb up in the Hummer
'Coz you're gonna get fucked tonight
Girl, gimme yo number
Forget it, I don't need your number
Bitch, climb up in the Hummer
'Coz you're gonna get fucked tonight
Can you break it down?
Can you break this down?
Can you break it down? Yeah
Can you break it down?
Can you break this down?
Can you break it down?
Girl, gimme yo number
Forget it, I don't need your number
Bitch, climb up in the Hummer
'Coz you're gonna get fucked tonight
Girl, gimme yo number
Forget it, I don't need your number
Bitch, climb up in the Hummer
'Coz you're gonna get fucked tonight
Girl, gimme yo number
Forget it, I don't need your number
Bitch, climb up in the Hummer
'Coz you're gonna get fucked tonight
Girl, gimme yo number
Forget it, I don't need your number
Bitch, climb up in the Hummer
'Coz you're gonna get fucked tonight
Didn't I yell use protection? You got HIV, you dirty nigga
You alright, I was ready for this shit, man
I swear to God, man, I don't think you gotta try, man
I swear to God, Lord knows
See Yayo, that's all we gotta do
As soon as they say somethin' about us singin'
We start shootin' again
