(50 Cent) 
She ain't that chick from the burbs thats a stranger to the drama
She that uptown girl with the cocky persona
Went out a way to let her know that I want her
I tell her I know fo' sho we belong togetha
And I wouldn't break her heart my intentions are betta
And I shared the same dreams she had about chedda
When the D's came she was down to hold the berretta
I got a thing for baby girl 
It's me and her against the world, whooooo
(Justin Timberlake)
You were my sun, you were my earth
But you didn't know all the ways I loved you, no
So you took a chance and made other plans
But I bet you didn't think that they would come crashing down, no
You don't have to say what you did,
I already know, I found out from him
Now there's just no chance for you and me, there'll never be
And don't it make you sad about it
You told me you loved me, why did you leave me all alone?
Now you tell me you need me when you call me on the phone
Girl, I refuse, you must have me confused with some other guy
Your bridges were burned and now it's your turn to cry
Cry me a river, cry me a river-er
Cry me a river, cry me a river-er, yeah, yeah
I know that they say that some things are better left unsaid
It wasn't like you only talked to him and you know it (don't act like you don't know it)
And all of these things people told me keep messing with my head (messing with my head)
You should've picked honesty, then you may not have blown it (yeah...)
You don't have to say what you did (don't have to say what you did)
I already know, I found out from him (I already know, uh)
Now there's just no chance for you and me, there'll never be (no chance, you and me)
And don't it make you sad about it
You told me you loved me, why did you leave me all alone? (all alone)
Now you tell me you need me when you call me on the phone (when you call me on the phone)
Girl, I refuse, you must have me confused with some other guy (I'm not like them, baby)
Your bridges were burned and now it's your turn (it's your turn) to cry
Cry me a river (go on and just)
Cry me a river-er (go on and just)
Cry me a river (baby go on and just)
Cry me a river-er, yeah, yeah
(Timbaland)
Oh (oh!), the damage is done, so I guess I be leaving
Oh (oh!), the damage is done, so I guess I be leaving
Oh (oh!), the damage is done, so I guess I be leaving
Oh (oh!), the damage is done, so I guess I be... l-l-l-leaving
(Justin Timberlake)
You don't have to say what you did (don't have to say what you did)
I already know, I found out from him (I already know, uh)
Now there's just no chance for you and me, there'll never be (no chance, you and me)
And don't it make you sad about it
Cry me a river (go on and just)
Cry me a river-er (baby, go on and just)
Cry me a river (you can go on and just)
Cry me a river-er, yeah, yeah
Cry me a river (baby, go on and just)
Cry me a river-er (go on and just)
Cry me a river ('cause I've already cried)
Cry me a river-er, yeah, yeah (ain't gonna cry, no more, yeah-yeah)
(50 Cent)
Your smile make my day, it's simple your dimples
Your eyes, your lips, your thighs got me hypnotized
Communications deep, I love it when we talk
Hatin' when you leave, but when you leave I love to watch you walk
You make a nigga forget about a life full of drama
She got expensive taste, she get it from her momma
Materialistic, still a nigga want her
Consistently missin' her touch when she gone
She smell like Chanel she feelin' me and I can tell
With the right woman by my side I feel like I cant fail
I've been around, been up and down, my attitude is fuck her now
She a rider, I feel like heaven when I'm inside her
Workin' up a sweat kissin' on her neck
12 play in the deck 4 play correct, have her drippin' wet
She looked in my eyes and said she liked it, but I knew she loved it
I just keep doin' what I'm doin' and think nothin' of it
