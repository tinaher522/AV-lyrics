<song artist="50_Cent" title="Clap_Those_Things">
Yeah, we stop fucking with theses niggaz
It's real, it's real, yo
This money done got a nigga like me in trouble
I made it niggaz hated, leave me dead, they beloved to
Mommy, before I walked up out that door, I should've hugged you
Who's my real friends, seems I'm living in a bubble
For crying like a bitch, nigga, get your fucking firearm
Got me blowing hollow tips right at your Teflon
Nigga, stick and move if you ain't getting stepped on
No heat? That's like a cop without his vest on
We bugging, constantly thugging, we ain't showing no loving
Ice griller than slugging face the repercussion
Niggaz stomach is touching, it's real, not for nothing
Keep faking and fronting, you know it's gonna be something
They say you live and you learn, niggaz never will learn
Burn heavily burn when streets and music merge
Niggaz coming at me sideways
Nigga, get your hammer and let's do this the right way, for real
You know we pop those thangs
(Yo, you scared get it, dog, you gully get a gun)
You know we pop those thangs
(Yo, you scared get it, dog, you gully get a gun)
You know we pop those thangs
(Yo, you scared get it, dog, you gully get a gun)
You know we pop those thangs
(Yo, you scared get it, dog, you gully get a gun)
If you scared, nigga, get a gun, don't go get a dog
Got a 44 long to put your ass in a morgue
You peace talk with your pistol, I send niggaz to get you
Ten grand to hit you, the shells are sure to split you
You chrome spot, drop gun in the stash box
Get your bitch ass shot, standing around here
The flow so hot, they say I got it locked
Hold on a second, homey, let's get this clear
The wrist stay rocked, the Ruger stay cocked
I hope you smoke a lot 'cuz I supply a weed spot
Now I got a question and I need the answer on the spot
That bitch you with, she like you or she like what you got?
It's 50 Cent and M O B B, breath easy
We ain't finna kill nothing, we just chilling, nigga
But look, dog, don't go acting loco
You in Queens, you a long way from Kansas
You know we pop those thangs
(Yo, you scared get it, dog, you gully get a gun)
You know we pop those thangs
(yo, you scared get it, dog, you gully get a gun)
You know we pop those things
(Yo, you scared get it, dog, you gully get a gun)
You know we pop those thangs
(Yo, you scared get it, dog, you gully get a gun)
Ay, yo, why dudes walk around with those on the hip?
The pocket or the box, nigga, wherever they fit
You know we done been through the worst of the shit
All we know is how to survive, y'all niggaz eat a dick
Eat it quick, eat your food through the I.V, fucking with P
Need a plastic bag attachment to shit?
Y'all make us so real, ice grill faces before them guns popped out
Now you look like you seen death
You ain't ready for murder, don't play with these kids
Upgrade to a set of wings fucking with my clique
Basically be a cold case fav real quick
People that enjoy life, they don't come to our set, place your bets
Your favorite rap is sex, I swell up niggaz heads
Frail niggaz is dead, better get your weight up, yeah
You heard what we said, bird niggaz ain't deaf
Fuck y'all wanna do about it, huh? Straight up
You know we pop those thangs
(Yo, you scared get it, dog, you gully get a gun)
You know we pop those thangs
(Yo, you scared get it, dog, you gully get a gun)
You know we pop those thangs
(Yo, you scared get it, dog, you gully get a gun)
You know we pop those thangs
(Yo, you scared get it, dog, you gully get a gun)
