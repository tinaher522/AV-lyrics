<song artist="50_Cent" title="Deadly_Devilz">
ok letz start from the little person from the book 
you might say he is a crook
his name is lil tima 
we chill wit him cause he a good rhyma
next we got weedy 
he aint greedy
he'll kick ur ass fast
and you wont be the last
the next person we got is blackice
he good but he aint no obie trice
he mad kool
for sure he aint no fool
the last person we got is biggie dix
he'll kill you wit just a pair of stix
he plays fare
jus dont look and stare
now we jus named the Deadly Devilz
this aint no game 
so there aint no levelz.
together were the best team 
piss us off and we'll let out steem!
