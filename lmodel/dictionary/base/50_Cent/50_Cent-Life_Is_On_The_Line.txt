<song artist="50_Cent" title="Life_Is_On_The_Line">
Nobody likes me, nobody likes me, but that's okay
'Cause I don't like y'all anyway
And I don't like y'all anyway
(Fuck all y'all)
My watch talk for me, my whip talk for me
My gat talk for me
(Blat)
What up homie, for bitches who don't know me
They wanna blow me, 'cause the shit I floss wit is sayin' a lot for me
I came in the rap humble, I don't give a fuck now
Serve anybody like niggaz who hustle uptown
Coke price go up, cats come down
The D's run in my crib, I'm nowhere to be found
The niggaz who do hustle for me, they don't even stash tracks
They keep it on 'em, right there in they ass crack
When I don't like a nigga, I don't pretend to
I'll have the paramedics wrap your fuckin' head like a Hindu
Look, I ain't goin' nowhere, so get used to me
OG's look at me and see I'm what they used to be
I'm that nigga that sold coke, the nigga that sold dope
The nigga that shot dice when broke to so so
The thug, that pop shit, the thug that pop clips
The thug that went from three and a half to whole bricks
Nigga ain't in his right mind, goin' against me
My picture's painted through words that make a blind man see
Scream murder, I don't believe you
Murder, fuck around and leave you
Murder, I don't believe you
Murder, murder, your life's on the line
Y'all niggaz don't want no parts of me
I'm tryna figure out how y'all started me
You gon' make me catch you on the late night
Pop shots wit the fifth and slide off in the six
I'm not a marksmen while spark issue, I spray random
Not a pretty nigga but my moms think I'm handsome
I hate to hear 'He say, she say', shit
Unless he say, she say, she on my dick
It's no coincidence, niggaz who fuck wit me get shot up
I do a Cali style drive by and tear ya block up
You soft through, be puttin' up a crazy front
I stay wit the Mac, 'cause niggaz tried to blaze me once
In the hood they like, "Damn, 50 really spitted on 'em"
"You heard that shit?", "Yeah, 50 really shitted on 'em"
Beef, you don't want none, so don't start none
You just a small player in this game, play your part son
Scream murder, I don't believe you
Murder, fuck around and leave you
Murder, I don't believe you
Murder, murder, your life's on the line
These cats always escape reality when they rhyme
That's why they write about bricks and only dealt wit dimes
Leave it to them, and they say they got a fast car
Nas car, truck wit a crash bar, and TV's in the dash, pa
See 'em in the five wit stock rims, I just laugh, pa
I catch stunts when I ain't tryin', I ain't lyin'
I sit Dom P til I spit up, keep my rent split up
Get outta line, I get you hit up
Now, if you say my name in your rhyme, you better watch what you say
You get carried away, you can get shot and carried away
Now, here's a list of MC's that can kill you in eight bars
50, umm, Jay-Z and Nas
I'ma say this shit now and never again
We ain't buddies, we ain't partners and we damn sure ain't friends
The games you playin', you get killed like that
Actin' like you all hard, you ain't built like that
See me when you see me nigga, what
Scream murder, I don't believe you
Murder, fuck around and leave you
Murder, I don't believe you
Murder, murder, your life's on the line
Y'all niggaz don't want no parts of me
I'm tryna figure out how y'all started me
You gon make me catch you on the late night
Pop shots wit the fifth and slide off in the six
