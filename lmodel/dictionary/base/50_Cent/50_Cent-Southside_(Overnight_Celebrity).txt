yeah man
f**k the hood man
f**k that i been tryin' to get away from that muthaf**ker for a long time man.I'm happy yall niggas is mad man.Your frown makes me smile.
Yall niggas know me man.
it is what it is man.
like I say yall know me

I be on the scene on the lean on a benz in tha bently,when I come throuh your strip.
Every trip every flip I get the grip.
I can go to the dealership and buy me a new whip.
Take fix 
new kicks
G6
new tricks I pick to suck on my dick.
G-Unit is the clique
and it's how it gets flipped
That's why you feelin' me bitch.
Niggas hate from a far
but they don't come around.
Cause they know how a nigga get down.
Once a nigga move around
wit a long trey pound.
I won't hesitate to let it off 6 rounds.

If yo ass get hit
Then you ain't do shit
F**kin' wit me that's what you get.
Now your lip
keep it zip
Before you get your babymama
caught up in this bullshit
Now what gets
it's a no no
niggas on
Lo go
but they tryin' to stay on the  LOE DOE
Gangsta fo sho
Every time a nigga flow
A nigga bank acount got
Mo' Dough
South side  G-Unit 12x
