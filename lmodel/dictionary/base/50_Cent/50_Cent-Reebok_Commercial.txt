[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Man I told ya'll I was finnin' to blow like C4
Stunt in the G5 fly in the G4
G Unit footwear, G Unit apparell
I'm so hood
That green and that white looks so good
Hip Hop man we gon take it to the next level
Kicks match that hat and that throwback
Kicks stay color coordinated man you know that
Truth is I ain't got a jump shot but I got a left hook
I don't swing golf clubs but I sell like Golf Brooks
I'm hot man
I rocky rock man
If it ain't the G Unit its the S Dot man
[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
S. Dots takin' off G4s 'bout to land
See how we cross brand
We boss about it man
Got the sole of the old Guccis if you upset sue me
If not sit back and watch me do me
Parking lot pimpin' sideline ballers
We don't sweat up we fresh let the girls do it for us
The watch talk for me
Drop talk for he
Brand new S Dots walk with me
Sort of like you just scored a bucket
Bootlegger you frontin' you walkin' awkardly
Ho its nothing keep score with me
Give me three hot seconds
I'll bring heat rock records
