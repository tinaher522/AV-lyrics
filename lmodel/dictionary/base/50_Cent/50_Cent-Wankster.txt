<song artist="50_Cent" title="Wankster">
Hoo, Yeah, it's 50 a.k.a Ferrari F-50
Break it down
I got a lot of living to do before I die
And I ain't got time to waste, let's make it
You said you were a gangsta but you never pop nothin'
We said you were a Wanksta and you need to stop frontin'
You ain't a friend of mine, you ain't no kin of mine
What makes you think that I'ma run up on you with the nine
We do this all the time, right now we on the grind
So hurry up and copy go selling nicks and dimes
Shorty she's so fine, I gotta make her mine
A ass like that gotta be one of a kind
I crush 'em every time, punch 'em with every line
I'm fucking with they mind, I make them press rewind
They know they can't shine if I'm around the rhyme
Been on parole since '94 'cause I commit the crime
I send you my line, I did a three to nine
If D's ran up in my crib, you know who droppin' dimes
You said you were a gangsta but you never pop nothin'
We said you were a wanksta and you need to stop frontin'
You go with the dealership, but you never cop nothin'
You been hustlin' a long time, and you ain't got nothin'
You said you were a gangsta but you never pop nothin'
We said you were a wanksta and you need to stop frontin'
You go with the dealership, but you never cop nothin'
You been hustlin' a long time, and you ain't got nothin'
Damn homie, in high school you was the man, homie
What the fuck happened you?
I got the sickest vendetta, when it come to the chedda
Nigga you play with my paper, you gonna meet my berretta
Now shorty think I'ma sweat her, sippin' on amoretta
I'm livin' once then deada, I know I can do betta'
She look good but I know she after my chedda
She tryin' to get in my pockets, homie and I ain't gonna let her
Be easy, start some bullshit, you get your whole crew wet
We're in the club doing the same old two step
Guerilla unit 'cause they say we bugged out
'Cause we don't go nowhere without toast we thugged out
You said you were a gangsta but you never pop nothin'
We said you were a wanksta and you need to stop frontin'
You go with the dealership, but you never cop nothin'
You been hustlin' a long time, and you ain't got nothin'
You said you were a gangsta but you never pop nothin'
We said you were a wanksta and you need to stop frontin'
You go with the dealership, but you never cop nothin'
You been hustlin' a long time, and you ain't got nothin'
Me I'm no mobsta', me I'm no gangsta'
Me I'm no hitman, me I'm just me, me
Me I'm no wanksta', me I'm no acta'
But it's me you see on your TV
'Cause I hustle baby, this rap shit is so easy
I'm gettin' what you get for a brick to talk greasy
By any means, partner, I got to eat on these streets
If you play me close, for sure I'm gonna pop my heat
Niggas sayin' they gonna murda 50, how?
We ridin' 'round with guns the size of Lil Bow Wow
What you know about AK's and AR 15's?
Equipped with night vision, shell catchers and dem things, huh
You said you were a gangsta but you never pop nothin'
We said you were a wanksta and you need to stop frontin'
You go with the dealership, but you never cop nothin'
You been hustlin' a long time, and you ain't got nothin'
You said you were a gangsta but you never pop nothin'
We said you were a wanksta and you need to stop frontin'
You go with the dealership, but you never cop nothin'
You been hustlin' a long time, and you ain't got nothin'
Aha
Damn homie
