<song artist="50_Cent" title="Death_To_My_Enemies">
Dre, niggas think we're bullshittin'
 Yeah, yeah
 Nigga try me, son, he best have the heat on him
 Want my eyes closed, get to moppin' the street with him
 Well, I put your body in a bag, front on me, I'm on ya ass
 I bring money to my niggas that bring death to my enemies
 I bring money to my niggas that bring death to my enemies
 Nigga front on me, the goons and goblins come out
 Wishmaster, hundred shot drums'll run out
 They dumb out, you heard of me, they call me big homie
 Me I make the register ring, I'm the cash cow
 They make the hammers ring, they on ya ass now
 Hair trigger, stare nigga, yeah, niggas'll flip
 Six shot semi-assault, let it off at your will
 Here I is, where the money is, I still get biz
 D's know about the beef, you gon' still get did
 It be your tombstone and your fuckin' grave they dig
 Have that ass in the precinct tryna talk to the pigs
 I'm like Damien, nigga, when I start gettin' loose on ya
 Closest thing to Lucifer, you think you got a noose on ya
 I make it hard to breathe
 I come with your hustle, air it out, make it hard to eat
 Have you lookin' both ways like you crossin' the street
 Try me, son, he best have the heat on him
 Want my eyes closed, get to moppin' the street with him
 Well, I put your body in a bag, front on me, I'm on ya ass
 I bring money to my niggas that bring death to my enemies
 I bring money to my niggas that bring death to my enemies
 Yeah, niggas send me the wrong message
 We gon' fucking kill the messenger
 Your whole clique hollow tips'll tear up the best of ya
 This ain't the Carter nigga, this is Sparta
 It's harder, I die and be a martyr, respect me like your father
 Let off a clip or let a case off
 I have your pussy ass runnin' like a race horse
 Follow orders now yeah shoot his face off
 You can have one, blast one, it's mad fun
 See how when you listen to me, all of the cash gone
 I was born with the tech, it's a birth defect
 I was deceived in the bins, ended up in a Benz
 This is what happens when have nots turn into Sasquatch
 Let the gat pop, boogie down on the back blocks
 It's horrific, nah, it's terrific
 I got it if you sniff it, go head, nigga, twist it
 Get lifted, goddamn, I'm gifted
 Try me, son, he best have the heat on him
 Want my eyes closed, get to moppin' the street with him
 Well, I put your body in a bag, front on me, I'm on ya ass
 I bring money to my niggas that bring death to my enemies
 I bring money to my niggas that bring death to my enemies
 Yeah, I tell 'em ride on 'em, then they ride on 'em
 Get the line on 'em and squeeze the .9 on 'em
 Head shot, .40 Glock, blow his mind on him
 They say ain't not a jooks, leave the shines on 'em
 Now you can watch me, nigga, like the police watch me
 I move proper, go ahead catch a shell tryna stop me
 That 430 Spider, carbon fiber
 And my dog is like Al-Qaeda, natural fighter
 Rapid fire, you're sweet like apple cider
 The mac'll fire, mask like Michael Myers
 It's off the wire when I get on my bullshit
 No smiles, no laughs, you gets no pass
 You can explain to my niggas while they whoop your ass
 My hands itch when the money comes, it's hard to explain it
 Last time I itched like this, a truckload came in
 Get money, get bread, that's what I do, kid
 Try me, son, he best have the heat on him
 Want my eyes closed, get to moppin' the street with him
 Well, I put your body in a bag, front on me, I'm on ya ass
 I bring money to my niggas that bring death to my enemies
 I bring money to my niggas that bring death to my enemies
