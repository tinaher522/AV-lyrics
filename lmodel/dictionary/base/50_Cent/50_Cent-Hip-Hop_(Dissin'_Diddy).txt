<song artist="50_Cent" title="Hip-Hop_(Dissin'_Diddy)">
Why haven't you learned anything?
1, 2, 1, 2
Nigga, I run hip hop, hip hop, hip hop, hip
Nigga, G-Unit is hip hop, hip hop, hip hop, hip hop
One thing 'bout my music, it hits you feel the pain
Nigga, I take control of your brain
Listen now, nigga, I'm not playin'
Are you ready for that? Soldier, soldier grab your gat
I'll show you who to aim it at
Bang bang bang, run, toss the gat
No, no, no, no lookin' back
Nigga, leave the watch, we ain't come for that
Bitch quit playin', where the paper at?
Shit I rolled ace, I'm shootin' it back
Damn you, Curtis Jackson for killing hip hop
Damn you, damn you and your money making ways
Bring it back, 1, 2, 1, 2
Nigga, I run hip hop, hip hop, hip hop, hip
Nigga, G-Unit is hip hop, hip hop, hip hop, hip hop
One thing 'bout my music, it hits you feel the pain
Nigga, I take control of your brain
Listen now, nigga, I'm not playin'
Are you ready for that? Soldier, soldier grab your gat
I'll show you who to aim it at
Bang bang bang, run, toss the gat
No, no, no, no lookin' back
Nigga, leave the watch, we ain't come for that
Bitch quit playin', where the paper at?
Shit I rolled ace, I'm shootin' it back
Every body know how my paper stack
20 inch chrome on the Cadillac
Automatic shotgun, can you handle that?
All the bullshit, nigga, that's a fact
Ride through your motherfuckin' hood strapped
Put work in, nigga, that's that
Things get to bust and you'll blast back
Got a little money, wanna flash that
'Til the wolves come out and blast gats
Pedal to the metal, nigga, mash that
'Fore your ass end up in a casket, I said in a casket
Who shot Biggie Smalls?
If we don't get them, they gon' kill us all
Man, Puffy know who hit that nigga, man, that nigga soft
He's scared dem boys from the Westside will break him off
Jump on his ass, so he run to Harlem to shake 'em off
Nigga, I run hip hop, hip hop, hip hop, hip
Nigga, G-Unit is hip hop, hip hop, hip hop, hip hop
Nigga, I run hip hop, hip hop, hip hop, hip
Nigga, G-Unit is hip hop, hip hop, hip hop, hip hop
Oh, I guess this means I won't be invited
To the white parties in the Hamptons, I don't give a fuck
I don't wanna hang out with your punk ass no way
Got me motherfuckin' runnin' around this nigga Ma$e
Now you wanna play games? You wanna make the deal, nigga?
Man, I'll fuck your shit up, nigga, is you crazy, nigga?
Matter 'fact, know what? I don't wanna do a deal no more
Fuck the deal, nigga, you wanna play games?
You wanna waste my motherfuckin' time, nigga?
Time is money, nigga, you wastin' the motherfuckin' money, nigga
Aight, I see what you tryin' to do
But I don't know why you doin' what you tryin' to do
Why do you wanna make me tell everybody what Misa told me, huh?
Now you go on and you send me 50 thousand dollars
For this nigga travel fees, you know, airfare, hotel space
For that last tour, nigga, 'fore I really service your ass, nigga
