<song artist="50_Cent" title="High_All_The_Time">
(chorus)
I don't need Dom Perignon, I don't need Cris
Tanqueray and Alize, I don't need shit
Nigga I'm high all the time, I smoke that good shit
I stay high all the time, man I'm on some hood shit
Give me some dro, purple haze and some chjocolate
Give me a dutch and a lighter I'll spark shit
And stay high all the time, I smoke that good shit
I'm high all the time, man I'm on some hood shit
(Verse 1)
everytime I Roll up niggas holla ROLL up and i tell em HOLD up 
U aint' gettin money u ain't smokin
In my Benzo 20 inch Lorenzos smokin on indo
Hiigh as a muthaf***a
I be on them backstreets niggas know i clap heat only if u got beef 
Man u better holla at me
Niggas get locked up stabbedup shot up
Everytime i pop up a lot goin on in my hood
I shoot the dice holler get em girls
Daddy need new shoes 
Daddy need  Perelli's to look mean on 22s
Stash box X box fax machine phone
Bullet proof this b****h and iam gone
2003 Surban swerving, too many sips of henny
The D's sick they searched the whip and they can't find the semis
They was just harassing me cause they know who I was
Spent da night in central Booking for smoking some bud
(chorus)
(verse 2)
now if u heard i done started some shit 
it ain't becuz i be high ( i be high i be high)
And if u heard i done let off a clip
It aint becuz i be high(i be high ibe high)
But i twist that la la la la
I get high as i wanna nigga
go agaianst me fa sho you's a goner nigga
I don't smoke to calm my nerves but i got beef
Finna crush my enemies like i crush the hashish
If u love me tell me u love, stare at me man
I'd hate to be in the benz clappin 1 of my fans
let me show u how to greet me when u meet me when u see me
IF u real my nigga u know how to holla"G-UNIT"
There's no competition its just me 
50cent, muthaf***a, Iam hot on these streets
If David could go against Goliath with a stone
I can go at Nas and Jigga, both for the throne
(chorus)
(verse 3)
NOw who u know besides me who writte lines and squeeze nines
And have hoes in the hood sniffin on white lines
u don't want me to be your kids role model
I'll teach them how to them 380s and load up them hollows
Have shorty fresh off the stoop, ready to shoot
Big blunt in his mouth, deuce deuce in his boot
Sit in the crib, sippin Ginness, watchin Menace
Then Oh Lord, have yong nigg bucking s**t like he O-DOG
My team they depend on me when its crunch time 
I eat a nigga food in broad day like its lunch time
u feelin brave nigga? go ahead get gully
See if I don't leave yor bain leaking up out your skully
I done made myself hot so ain't sh** u can tell me
Niggas callin me the feature, man fuck yo money
I ain't hurtin I'm aight nigga Iam doin good
I ain't gotta write rhymes, I Got bricks in the hood
(chorus)
G-UNIT, are u ready
G-UNIT,are u ready
Nigga, ready or not here I come ,come,come
