Come and get a scoop of my ice cream baby

Baby u know I got all the flavors that u want

Vanilla, strawberry, chocolate baby boy it's on

Baby come lay your body right here I want 2 ride it
Switch it up, turn it around now come on and get inside
Tonight ur gonna have so much fun while tasting my love
Tell me do u have a taste 4 vanilla waffers
Chorus(1x)
