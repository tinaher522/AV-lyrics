<song artist="50_Cent" title="Follow_My_Lead">
[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Follow my lead, baby I could be all you need, If you follow my lead
Follow my lead, I'll hold you down put your trust in me, baby follow my lead
Follow my lead, I think God made you for me, follow my lead
Follow my lead, I'm the one Girl in time you'll see
[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Dont listen to the rumours they say 50 f**kin' crazy
50 dont know how to treat a lady 
They wrong, I like you a lot I dont wanna hurt you
But I call a square a square and a circle a circle
So if you act like a bitch, I call you a bitch then hang up
Probably call you right back and shit
And I have to say baby I apologize, cross my fingers God forgive me for
tellin' lies
Like Janet Jackson say "I miss you much, I really wanna feel your touch"
As Bobby said "Baby I could pass the day, watchin' you model Lingerie"
I wanna spend the night tonight shorty If its okay
You can be my Beyonce I'll be your Jay
I gotta great sense of humour, questions make ya smile then I whoo ya!
You know how I do ya, or do ya?
[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Follow my lead, baby I could be all you need, If you follow my lead
Follow my lead, I'll hold you down put your trust in me, baby follow my lead
Follow my lead, I think God made you for me, follow my lead
Follow my lead, I'm the one Girl in time you'll see
[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
It's New York, to London, you wonderin' whats gonna be the next stop
I told you, Im'a Don you goin' on ma'dam
After you shop 'till your feet hurt in Malones
Now take a picture these are moments you can cherrish
They say the scene of me was made for lovers out in Paris
The risers and the beleivers sayin' "50 we love you"
But out there, theres no me so I love them
You may not recognize this, the reason I exist
Deliver best than the best so perfection I guess
Just like I miss the stress, I'll pass the test
Everytime I drop, Im burnin' hot
I dont care If she loves me or loves me not
As long as I enjoy the time that we spent
I dont care, baby we could f**k and be friends
Matter fact we can do it right in the back of my Benz
You know its me...
[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Follow my lead, baby I could be all you need, If you follow my lead
Follow my lead, I'll hold you down put your trust in me, baby follow my lead
Follow my lead, I think God made you for me, follow my lead
Follow my lead, I'm the one Girl in time you'll see
