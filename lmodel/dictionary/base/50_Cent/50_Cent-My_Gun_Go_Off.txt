My Gun
(50 Cent)
(Gunshots &amp; Tire Screeching) 
(Chorus)
Nigga, my gun go off
You see the barrell turnin'
You feel the hollows burnin'
Nigga now you learnin'
Nigga, my gun go off
Call it attempted murder
Nigga I'm tryin to merk ya,
When I come back bustin'
Nigga, my gun go off
Don't try to say I'm trippin'
When I get to flippin'
Then I smack the clip in,
Nigga, my gun go off
We call it putting work in,
Leavin niggas hurtin,
Homocide's learkin'
My gun go off
(Verse 1)
F**k Boy you can see it to believe it
Tryna dodge and wave it end up a parapelegic
Believe me its easy
I'll hurt you, I'll merk you, I'll pop summin'
Drop summin', I aint gonna stop hunting
Run run till you're spun
One shot One gun  
One-9...
1-1 emergency,
It's murder, B
It's excellent execution when I'm pulling the trigger
No mistake for that cake
I'm hittin you and your niggas
Feel the flame when I aim,
For the top of your brain
See the spark and the bang,
Nigga shit ain't a game
Do the math or get blast
Bullets go through the glass
Go through your ass fast
And the leather seat sittin Ave.
Its not a war when there's casualties on one side
I ride
Turn it up on you niggas after Jay ride by
I click-clack thats that i don't flash, i mash
I wave the Uzi at em,
I make a movie out em.
(Chorus)
Nigga, my gun go off
You see the barrell turnin'
You feel the hollows burnin'
Nigga now you learnin'
Nigga, my gun go off

Call it attempted murder
Nigga I'm tryin to merk ya,
When I come back bustin'
Nigga, my gun go off
Don't try to say I'm trippin'
When I get to flippin'
Then I smack the clip in,
Nigga, my gun go off
We call it putting work in,
Leavin niggas hurtin,
Homocide's learkin'
My gun go off
(Verse 2)
You better lose yourself in the moment
Use it, F**k the music I'ma let it go
You only get one shot before I back out and fire back
At ya hat, ya back, ya ass crack, ya nutsack.
Your caddilac if you make it to that, 
I'm hitting that
The 70's was smack
The 80's crack.
The 90's was grimey
Millenium mac man
Clips on the whips I ride in em
Bad bitches I ride inn em
Dont worry i'll get 'em
Gat Jammed or un-jammed
God dam Safest the safety dont work
Squeeze the eagle, it chirp.
End up faced down in the dirt
More than hurt,
Bring the beef where you hang out,
Bang out,
Shots ring out.
Hit your shoulders tryin to blow your brains out.
Hit your homies in their legs,
Bet they have their canes out tomorrow
You kno tomorrow's just a day away,
If you can keep your heart beatin' then your ass awake.
(Chorus)
Nigga, my gun go off
You see the barrell turnin'
You feel the hollows burnin'
Nigga now you learnin'
Nigga, my gun go off
Call it attempted murder
Nigga I'm tryin to merk ya,
When I come back bustin'
Nigga, my gun go off
Don't try to say I'm trippin'
When I get to flippin'
Then I smack the clip in,
Nigga, my gun go off
We call it putting work in,
Leavin niggas hurtin,
Homocide's learkin'
My gun go off
