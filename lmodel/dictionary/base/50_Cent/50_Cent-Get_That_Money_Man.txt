GGGGGG G Unit 50 Cent, Gerth Street ATL to Dallas ya heard me?

Porsche spots drop
Gun in the stash box
Get ya bitch ass shot stuntin around here (here)
Flow so hot
They say I got it locked
Hold on a second homie, lets get this clear
Look the wrist stay rocked
The Ruger stay cocked
I hope ya smoke alot cause I supply the weed spot
Got a few questions and I need the answer on the spot
That bitch you wit, she like you or she like what she got?
Tryin to maintain
Tearin niggas out the frame
Semi automatic flows 
You know how it goes
Boss B-O-S-S-M-A-N
Gun in hand
Understand gettin money is the plan
Gerth Street is my man
[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Lets get that money man

[Verse 2:]
Call me the unemployment office, cause a nigga got that work
Niggas stavin on the other side I lock they turf
If ya funkin' you don't wanna get popped at first
Cause ya might end up bein locked in that hearse
I'm a veteran and you'ze an amateur kid
I'll fuck ya bitch and video tape it like Tommy and Pamela did
We put the icing on the cake and we covered the spread
You fuck with me or my niggas you'll be covered in red
Thats like when them young niggas smothered that kid
Niggas snitched on eachother now they both doin a bid
Dumbass niggas you supposed to have ya allibi straight
When ya gettin interogatted you supposed to keep a straight face
I keep it gangsta for my niggas up in Cali
We sit on 23 inch spinners up in the alley
We smoke on dro from Texas to the NY
Ten niggas with me that mean ten niggas with ten knives
nigga
[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Lets get that money man 
yeah!
lets get that money man
lets get that money man
yeah! 
lets get that money man
lets get that money man
yeah!
lets get that money man
lets get that money man
[Verse 3: Lloyd Banks]
Its on now time to cut the cake 
fuck the jake tuck the plate
nigga move dump the eight
guaranteed to pump his brakes
To pissy drunk the case ain't got a month to waste
Smile with a pumpkin face
Deep enough to jump the states
Stuff you in the trunk escape
You want a problem?
Fuck the Bapes, up the stakes
Everything I wear is up to date
Loyal cat, guaranteed my son'll be a spoiled brat
Hot enough to boil crack
M-5 all you black
I'm the reason all you rap
Admit it I'm Daddy Black
Doin this since Caddy Shack
With Gurth Street In that Caddy Lac
Blowin' out a pillow pack
I call it "Coffee Brown"
Bitches can't get off me now
Rasta man toss me pounds
I ain't from a softy town
Niggas'll brake ya bones, crack ya face
Call the doctor let him put it back in place
