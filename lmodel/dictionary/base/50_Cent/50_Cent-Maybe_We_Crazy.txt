[Intro: 50 Cent]
Yea, Uhuh, Lets Take Em Dre, Yea
[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Tony Did Ten Years In The Fed Joint, He Half Way Out
He Aint Home, His Ass In A Halfway House
Correctional Facilities Don't Correct Shi*
Cause The First Thing He Asked Is Who Gotta Get Hit
A Shoot Out In 89' Fu**** Up How He Walk
He A Grimey Ass Ni**A, You See How He Talk
Should Shoot The Shepard In The Head And Da Sheep Gonna Scatter,
Let Ni**As Talk Cause Action Is All That Matters,
I Asked About Bones Self-Esteem, He Said He Was Soft,
Said The Boys Up In Oldsville Was Breakin Him Off
Can You Picture Him In A Jar, Ni**As Jokin Him Up,
Treatin Him Like A Pin Cushion, Pokin Him Up
He Came Home Actin Like He Hard As Fu**
Must Want A First Class Ni**A To See God Uhuh
Stuck His Chest Out Tell A Ni**A We Dont Back Down
But Wait Until We Find Out Tonys Background
[Chorus x2: 50 Cent]
Maybe We Crazy, But This Is The Way We Came Up,
Ni**A Front, Then Somethin Gon Go Down,
Ni**A Stunt, Cruise To This Bitch If You Want,
Widout A Strap, And You Gon Getcha Ass Layed Down
[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
That Ni**A Joe Comin Home Soon He Up There In Four People,
Its On When He Touch That Cause He Can Get Enough Bricks,
When I Was Young He Told Me Not To Run, I Pop My Gun Pa,
You Can Ask Gun Or La La Love Then Aim Hard,
Im Interested To Hear Back In The Days,
They Aint Better Than My Brain, Young Crime Is Pay,
New Cadillacs And Bonnevilles The Very Next Day,
I Just Hope He Learn, I Aint Have Much To Say,
Lead Jus Squeeze The Life Out You Like A Boa Constrictor,
F*** A Headlock, Im Talking Bout Extortion Ni**A,
Apply Pressure, Its Hot Get The F*** Out The Kitchen,
When Ni**As Pay Ya Every Friday U Aint Got To Stick Em,
At The Dice Game If Ace Roll A Six Its No Problem,
But If You Roll A Ace He Gon Pull Out A Robin,
Losin A Little Or Lose Lot, When Ni**As Is Starving,
Man The Drama In My Hoods Goin Down Regardless
[Chorus x2: 50 Cent]
Maybe We Crazy, But This Is The Way We Came Up,
Ni**A Front, Then Somethin Gon Go Down,
Ni**A Stunt, Cruise To This Bit** If You Want,
Widout A Strap, And You Gon Getcha Ass Layed Down
[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
Everbody Know Education Shots Is All Over Short Paper,
You On The Run You Want A Ni**A Hit Son Hit Take It Here,
Rise Got Shot Up Over Some Punk Sh**,
In The Club Beef With Some Ni**As Over Some Punk Bit**,
They Say Wooly Was Caked Up Off Some Credit Card Scams,
Got Him The Permit, The Ni**A Took The Money And Ran,
Heard He Was Outta Town Ridin Round In The Pound
Caught Him Spending 545 I No Lie Ask How,
Out On Va, Camron Home, Come Through Here Cruise By,
He Run In To Dem Ni**As That He Beat, He Gon Die
Caught His Crooks Cuz D Flashin His Mugshot,
He Notices M.O. Don Run Up In Dem Crack Spots,
His Sister, She Aaight, Big Hips, Lil Waist, Big Tits,
Pretty Face, We F***** On The Staircase,
Lisa That√¢ss My Bit** She Freak Off Wid A Ni**A, Shit,
Man I Gotta Call That Bit**!
[Chorus x2: 50 Cent]
Maybe We Crazy, But This Is The Way We Came Up,
Ni**A Front, Then Somethin Gon Go Down,
Ni**A Stunt, Cruise To This Bitch If You Wan
