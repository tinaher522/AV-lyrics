(Chorus) (Sampled Eminem)
Big and some Pac and you mix them up in a pot
Mix them up in a pot, mix them up in a pot
Take some Big and some Pac and mix them up in a pot
Mix them up in a pot, what the fuck do you got?
(Fifty!)
Big an, Big and some Pac and you mix them up in a pot
Mix them up in a pot, mix them up in a pot
Its Big and some pac n you mix em up and you got, juggernaughts of this rap shit, like it or not
(50 Cent verse)
I got a gambling problem, I bet you niggas am a be back bustin but you won't notice me when that gat dumpin, you wana bet?
I lost money when I bet on Roy, won money when I bet on Floyd, I'm the one that bet on war
Undefeated, eyes roll like I'm weeded
I Bet you niggas think I won't be number 1 again,
I read the stakes, you know why I put mo' on the line
Its showtime I ama goin for my mine, you can bet that,I bet that tecjam before that mac, I bet that dope go before that crack, I bet my money stack
I bet yo bitch wana roll with 50, I bet if I said I'm going to the hotel she'd go with me,
I bet you really love her man you think she wouldn't come, she got your pussy wooped
Her head game, it got you sprung
I'm taking all bets, through all sets I be a bookie
That have to be 10% off the top, fucking rookies.
(Chorus) (Sampled Eminem)
Big and some Pac and you mix them up in a pot
Mix them up in a pot, mix them up in a pot
Take some Big and some Pac and mix them up in a pot
Mix them up in a pot, what the fuck do you got?
(Fifty!)
Big an, Big and some Pac and you mix them up in a pot
Mix them up in a pot, mix them up in a pot
Its Big and some pac n you mix em up and you got, juggernaughts of this rap shit, like it or not
(50 Cent) (outro)
Fifty! (fifty!) Ohhhh! (Ohhh)
I wana bet y'all niggas, it ain't gone be
The old niggas like me!
Trust me, I came up hard! (came up hard!)
All you gotta do is go through my hood,
Southside, niggas like me all up and down there,
On the corners, in the penitentiary, they from southside
Yea, they ain't on the top of the charts
They don't know the formula, they ain't on the hot 500,
They like me!
(Sampled Eminem Chorus)
