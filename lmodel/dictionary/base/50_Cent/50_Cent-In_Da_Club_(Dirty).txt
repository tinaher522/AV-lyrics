<song artist="50_Cent" title="In_Da_Club_(Dirty)">
Go, go, go
go, go, go, go Shawty 
It's ya Birthday
We're gonna party like it's ya Birthday
We're gonna sip Bacardi like it's ya Birthday 
And u know we don't give a fuck it's not you're Birthday
(Chorus x2)
U can find me in da Club bottles full of bub
Look mammi, I got the X if ya in to taking drugs
I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into making love 
So come give me a hug if you into getting rubbed
When I pull out up front, you see the Benz on dubs
When I roll 20 deep, is 20 knives in the club
Niggas heard I fuck with Dre now they wanna show me love
When you sell like Eminem and the hoes they wanna fuck 
But homie ain't nothing change ho down, G's Up
I see Xzibit in the cut that nigga roll the weed up
If you watch how I move you mistake me fo a playa or pimp
Been hit with a few shells but I dont walk with a limp
In the hood the ladys saying 50 you hot
They like me, I want them to love me like they love Pac
But how them new york, niggas tell ya I'm loco
When the plan is to put the rap game in a choke-hold
I'm fully focused man, my money on my mind
Got a meal. out the deal and I'm still on the grind
Now shorty said she feelin my style she feeling my flow
A girlfriend with it get ride and we ready to go..(Ya ok)
(Chorus x2)
U can find me in da Club bottles full of bub
look mammi, I got the X if ya in to taking drugs
I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into making love 
So come give me a hug if you into getting rubbed
(Bridge)
Mah flow, Mah show, brought me the dough,
That bought me all my fancy things, 
Mah Crib, mah cars, Mah pools, Mah jewls,
Look nigga I got kmart and I aint change
And you should love it, way more then you hate it
Nigga you mad, i thought that you'd be happy I made it
I'm that cat by the bar, toasting to the good life
You that faggot ass nigga trying to pull me back ride
When it dark, Well be pumping in the club, its on
Now with my eyes on my bitch, if she smiles, she gone
If the roof on fire, let that mothafucka burn
If u talk about money homie, I aint concern
I'mma tell you what Banks told me cause go ahead switch the style up
If niggas hit the letta make watch the money pile up
Or we go upside there with a bottle of bub
Nigga you know where we fucking B
(Chorus x2)
U can find me in da Club bottles full of bub
look mammi, I got the X if ya in to taking drugs
I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into making love 
So come give me a hug if you into getting rubbed
ha ha ha ha
Dont try to act like u dont know who we be neitha' nigga
We in da club all da time nigga
Is a problem? pop off nigga
G unit.
