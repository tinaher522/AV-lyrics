(Hook)
Shorty you aint gotta take your panties off, 
Just pull em to the side, 
If you want to ride on the roller coaster baby come on and ride, 
they go up and down,and round and round, stand up or get on the floor, 
its on tonight, 
I know what you like,
I know just how to break you off.
(1st Verse)
Good evening ladies, 
I'll tell you from the start, I'm hoping you enjoy my amusement park, 
theres lots of activities fun things to do, 
and i'll find my pleasure in pleasing you, 
some rides go fast, some rides go slow, 
you fear heights when im high, hell yeah i go low!
It tastes so sweet, thats sticky cotton candy, 
you get carried away, we can start a family.
Its a perfect time for a magic trick, 
girl you know its no fun without the magic stick!
Now watch me, as I pull a rabbit out the hat, 
and you can use the rabbit all over your cat.
Applaude now its the first half of my act,
started out a pimp, now im more like a mac.
I dont need your paper, just dont fuck with my stacks,
 Oh its like that? Yeah its like that!
(Hook)
Shorty you ain't gotta take your panties off,

its on tonight, 
I know what you like,
I know just how to break you off.
(Bridge)
Now you can ride the horse around the carousel, 
exploded trojans all in the hotel, 
put me to the test girl i dont fail, 
i work it out, without a doubt!

(2nd Verse)
Theres plenty water rides, im sure to get you wet in the park, 
have you lust and seductious considering a knot, 
throw a loop around the bottle, i'll be your teddy bear, 
whatever color you like, you know i dont care.
I really want to thank you for attending this affair.
Now go encourage your friends to come have fun here.
I smile when i speak, but im being senciere, 
and your pass is valid all summer my dear.
So at your convenience you can always return,
theres so many tricks to the trade you should learn.
Suck that, 
lick that, 
swallow that lollipop.
Forget that,
grip that, 
ride it nonstop!!!
