[Chorus]
Who run it? 
You know ya acting like ya don't know 
We run it 
You know but ya acting like ya don't know 
Who run it? 
You know ya acting like ya don't know 
We run it 
You know but ya acting like ya don't know 
You know ya acting like ya don't know 
I tear the club up fo sho 
This flow is gon' bring mo dough 
You know but ya acting like ya don't know 
[50 Cent] 
Now homey I say I runnit runnit cause I'm in control 
Hpnotiq, Hennessy, a couple shots of Patrón 
I have ya feeling aight, I get ya high as a kite 
Party-poppin shawty says she coming with me tonight 
I aint shoulda' leanin', I aint snapping and popping either
I'm bopping my head or I'm just standing there watching 
I'ma hustler I hustle, you can tell that I'm paid 
And I protect what I got, I'm in a house with my blade 
Nigga you front you gonna get it, OK now maybe I've said it 
Cause I want you to triddip, yea I be on that shit hit
You should see when I'm stuntin' I flash the stones to be wanton 
Push the grip see me rollin', you can tell that I'm holdin' 
I'm just doing my thang, you know the units the game 
I got my grimey Shady with me you front you'll have to get me 
Off your ass I'll pay the lawsuit and laugh 
Haha its not a big deal it's nothing but some cash 
Lets Go… 
[Chorus] 
Who run it? 
You know ya acting like ya don't know 
I tear the club up fo sho 
This flow is gon' bring mo dough 
You know but ya acting like ya don't know 
Who run it? 
You know ya acting like ya don't know 
I tear the club up fo sho 
This flow is gon' bring mo dough 
You know but ya acting like ya don't know 
[Eminem] 
When me and Fif' got together to do this music and movie
The more we became enveloped we just developed a fellowship through it 
It's no pretend shit its friendship mi nemesis es su nemesis 
Same for him it's just media see to them images it's just images 
But this shit is no gimmicks this is blood-in and blood-out 
When there's beef you just gotta know when to butt-in and butt-out, 
If there's a problem we solve it, we don't resolve it 
It usually just evolves into one big brawl and we all get involved in it
We should all get a merit, cause most beef we inherit 
And wear it like a badge of honor pass it around and share it 
And let it go to whoever's holding the most current beef on they're shoulders 
And the soldiers got their backs till it's over 
But tonight, we aint come in here to beef with nobody 
We came to party - Banks, Cashis and Mr. Ferrari 
So it's Shady Afterm-izzath back in that ass 
You wizz-ass, come-izzon, what kinda fizz-uckin musician is that?

[Chorus] 
Who run it? 
You know ya acting like ya don't know 
I tear the club up fo sho 
This flow is gon' bring mo dough 
You know but ya acting like ya don't know 
Who run it? 
You know ya acting like ya don't know 
I tear the club up fo sho 
This flow is gon' bring mo dough 
You know but ya acting like ya don't know 
[Cashis] 
Pistol play ricochet see where the victim lay 
Slumped over bleedin, J.F.K 
H.K. to ya chest plate, cave 
I will ride to the death, do you rep thatta way? 
Forever I'ma be a Shady 7-4 gangsta 
Plus I'll survive everything you got in that chamber 
I thrive off of danger, jumpin in all beef 
You keep talking shit, now the squad can call me 
[Lloyd Banks] 
Enough holding back the steam, Em let off a magazine 
Dapper Don, Cap' of Queens, mixed in with Cashis creams 
Started off with half a dream, developed into what you see 
Telling aint my cup of tea, can't tell I'ma fucking G? 
I'm all automatic when I'm at it, start static and you splattered 
Shit shattered, I'ma walking bitch magnet 
Spit it how I live it live it always to the limit 
And I'm always on my pivot for my digits you dig it? 
So………
[Chorus] 
We run it 
You know ya acting like ya don't know 
I tear the club up fo sho 
This flow is gon' bring mo dough 
You know but ya acting like ya don't know 
Who run it? 
You know ya acting like ya don't know 
I tear the club up fo sho 
This flow is gon' bring mo dough 
You know but ya acting like ya don't know 
Who run it?
