<song artist="50_Cent" title="Funny_How_Time_Flies">
I know what she like,
I know what she want,
Yeah yeah [x3]
My b-tch just like me so I know she want stunt,
A taste of the good life, yeah I know what she want,
A trip to PR, sex in the car, floating diamonds shabar,
Cool as hood, it's all good, that's what we are,
Find exotic space to visit, chinchilla, gator-lizid
That's how a n-gga gizzit, when I'm on my shizzit,
Bright light, city lights, for n-ggas so flashy,
How you like that, dat ferrari flew past me,
So fast a n-gga don't know limits,
Had a bad b-tch in it, I can't see da boy tinted,
Get the money then spin it, break rules or bend it,
To my liking, I move like a viking, a warrior,
I shouldn't mean more to you,
I'm the american dream, one man regime,
Shorty love me like she love new shoes,
Then she sure to investigate me like the feds ohhh,
[Chorus:]
Funny how time flies, when were making love,
It goes on and on and on,
We just can't go wrong [x2]
N-ggas smile, they can frown, they can love it,
They can hate it, they can wish mad sh-t on us,
It's cool we made it,
Look at me to see the lords blessings,
While they stressing,
Switch whips, push the Bugatti through the recession,
It's just me and you, I can see it clear,
Hoes coming I need you to snatch this b-tch to here,
It's all hood, you hesitate they put our life on pause,
It's a commen wealth state baby they make up laws,
F-ck [? ] it's you or me baby, we all we got,
I say we gon make, they sayin we not,
Yeah but they don't know I'm meant for you,
They don't know how you into me,
They don't know sh-t bout how we bond mentally,
Their relationships are oh so basic,
They can't understand how we do and how we say sh-t,
So blunt, don't front, I got you open,
It's the original G sh-t, you know how we Duck down,
[Chorus]
