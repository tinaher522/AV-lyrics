[Verse 1:]
I take quarter water sold it in bottles for 2 bucks,
Coca-Cola came and bought it;
for billions, what the f**k?

be a millionaire
i write the check before the baby comes,
who the f**k cares
Im stanky rich
Ima die tryna spend this shit
Southside's up in in this bitch
Yeah i smell like the vault
i used to sell dope
i did play the block
now i play on boats
in the south of France
baby, St. Tropez
Get a tan? im already black
Rich? I'm already that
gangsta, get a gat
hit a head in a hat
call that a riddle rap
shit, f**k the chitter chat
I'm the baker, i bake the bread
the barber, i cut ya head
the marksman, i spray the lead
"I blood clot, chop ya leg"
do not f**k with the kid
i get biz wit the cigg

[Chorus:]
I get money, money is got (I I get it)

[Ludacris:]
Put the needle on the record
