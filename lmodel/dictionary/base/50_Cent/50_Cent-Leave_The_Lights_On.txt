<song artist="50_Cent" title="Leave_The_Lights_On">
Say man you don't need much

60-69, leave the lights on
Can't see shit, leave the lights on
Girl i can't see the shit, leave the lights on
Girl, leave the lights on
60-69, leave the lights on
10, leave the lights on
Seat down, my..belly the pipe down
Girl, i make the bad rock like i'm on the yard shits

Time is money check my turbie on movement
I'm rich bitch i say move you get the movin

Looking ain't hard to tell who's winning who's losing
Got the pen out surround my wrist
I'm flashin out, condo round my neck i'm cashin out
I'm nigga rich got everything to rich nigga get
I got whip for days, i got dick for days
Louie her mess is hard to jimmie juice

All habits, baby show me what you know
At the freakie you came out on the low
Chorus:

Come and be a freak for me

Will never spikes for me but you get your ass sweep
Limited the time skip the four play

Let's get the stroking boning moaning, rolling
Starting afternoon end up in next morning
Stop the next round, look for my net down
So she do do..

So everything you do to me, i'll do to you, come on

Hey girl i know you want me,
No, what the hell wouldn't you want me
Shawty now push upon me
Zip down my super player with the pipe on
You're gonna just be like that
You're so insensitive
Hurt my feelings
I mean from the bottom of my heart i love you
