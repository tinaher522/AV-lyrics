[chorus:]
Man I run this rap shit
Get your hands up high, hands up high, hands up high
Rest in piece to Biggie Smalls
Get your hands up high, hands up high, hands up high
R.I.P. to Tupac
Get your hands up high, hands up high, hands up high
Nigga roll that good shit
Get your hands up high, hands up high, hands up high
[verse 1: 50 cent]
You wanna dance lets dance nigga ill take you to da prom
I'm armed tre pound in my palm I'm calm
Nigga my mamma made a baby boy the hood made a man
My first 14 grams took that and made a grand
I do this you knew this I told you pussy
You're fate you're death date ill fucking come for you pussy
Have you like ei-ei-uh oh after the 44 blow
I get low they say I go like a pro
Its a rap when I'm doseing
You smoked like a roach
You been clapped then in fact there's no coming back from that
I'm the last of my breed
No henny no weed
Just my vest and my semi
In the back of that bentley
I'm nos and I'm bras
See I'm there and I'm gone
Cause my loyals is strong
And my money here is long
So when I'm right I'm right
And when I'm wrong I'm right
Ill hit your ass up right
Nigga its nighty night
[chorus:]
Man I run this rap shit
Get your hands up high, hands up high, hands up high
Rest in piece to Biggie Smalls
Get your hands up high, hands up high, hands up high
R.I.P. to Tupac
Get your hands up high, hands up high, hands up high
Nigga roll that good shit
Get your hands up high, hands up high, hands up high
[verse 2: tony yayo]
Hey yo I'm higher than a pilot man
Ill cut your body man
Beat the case I lied on a polygram
These ogs talk about back in the days
I have an r.i.p. sign on your myspace page
I'm your top eight nigga
Drop eight nigga
GCT coupe its sour grape nigga
I'm an ape nigga a gorilla in the mist
I hold weight nigga my connect gots bricks
I wear gold you wear platinum we still got the same cars
Same house and still fuck the same broads
Dreams of fucking an r&amp;b bitch
Yeah you look good girl but get your teeth fixed
I'm the teflon don boy I get busy
You're legs to strong doing sex with pretty ricky
760 drive by light tint
With two hoes in the whip looking like flip
[chorus:]
Man I run this rap shit
Get your hands up high, hands up high, hands up high
Rest in piece to Biggie Smalls
Get your hands up high, hands up high, hands up high
R.I.P. to Tupac
Get your hands up high, hands up high, hands up high
Nigga roll that good shit
Get your hands up high, hands up high, hands up high
