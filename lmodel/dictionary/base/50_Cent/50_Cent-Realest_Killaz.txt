Yo, Red Spider
Is that 50 Cent and Pac ready?
Lemme know, holla
It's go'n be some stuff you go'n see
That's go'n make it hard to smile in the future
Yeah nigga, ha ha
Let's go nigga, dis is what it is
Tupac cut his head bald
Then you want to cut yo head bald
Tupac wear a bandana
You wanna wear a banadana
(What do we have here now?)
Tupac put a cross on his back
You wanna put crosses on yo back
Nigga, you ain't Tupac
Is it money and women, funny beginning's tragic ending's?
I can make a million and still not get enough of spendin'
And since my life is based on sinnin', I'm hell bound
Rather be buried that be worried, livin' held down
Yo,that shit is crazy Whoo Kid
Bring that muthafuckin' beat back man
It's go'n be some stuff you go'n see
That's go'n make it hard to smile in the future
Yeah nigga, ha ha
Let's go nigga, dis is what it is
Tupac cut his head bald
Then you want to cut yo head bald
Tupac wear a bandana
You wanna wear a banadana
(What do we have here now)
Tupac put a cross on his back
You wanna put crosses on yo back
Nigga, you ain't Tupac
Is it money and women, funny beginning's tragic ending's?
I can make a million and still not get enough of spendin'
And since my life is based on sinnin', I'm hell bound
Rather be buried that be worried, livin' held down
My game plan to be trained in
Military mind of a thug lord sittin' in a cemetery cryin'
I've been lost since my adolescence calling for Jesus
Ballin' as a youngster wondering if he see's us
Young black males
Crack sales got me three strikes
Livin' in jail this is hell enemies die
Wonder when we all pass, is anybody listnin'?
Got my hands on my semi shotty, everybody's snitchin'
Please God can you understand me, bless my family
Guide us all before we fall into insanity
I'm makin' a point to make my beatin' bumpin' raw life
Drop some shit to make these stupid bitches jaw tight
Till Makaveli return it's all eyes on me, on me
(What do we have here now?)
And you can hate it or love it
But that's what it's go'n be, go'n be
Shoulda listened, I told you not to fuck wit me, wit me
(What do we have here now?)
Now can you take the pressure
That's what we go'n see, go'n see
This is a cry for mercy, I promise
My success would be the death of you
Low and behold, you sold ya soul
Theres nothing left of you
Look in the mirror, ask yourself, who are you?
If you don't know who you are
How could ya dreams come true?
Muthafucka, I sat backed and watched ya
You pretended to be Pac
You pretended to be hot but you not, now
(Now)
You sea-so crip, you can't take the pressure, you pussy
I warned you not to push me
You see me and chills, run up ya spine
God made menace in war but ya heart ain't like mine
And plus, they look at me like I'ma menace
I was playing wit guns, while ya momma had you
And yo friends playing tennis
I'ma nightmare, you see me in ya dream
Wake up and turn on ya TV, and see my ass again
You cowardly hearted, you couldn't make it on ya own
Fuck the source, I'm on the cover of Rollin' Stone
Till Makaveli return it's all eyes on me, on me
(What do we have here now?)
And you can hate it or love it
But that's what it's go'n be, go'n be
Shoulda listened, I told you not to fuck wit me, wit me
(What do we have here now?)
Now can you take the pressure
That's what we go'n see, go'n see
Till Makaveli return it's all eyes on me, on me
(What do we have here now?)
And you can hate it or love it
But that's what it's go'n be, go'n be
Shoulda listened, I told you not to fuck wit me, wit me
(What do we have here now?)
Now can you take the pressure
That's what we go'n see, go'n see
