Bo!
We in here
Bo!
We can get the drama poppin'
We don't care
Bo! Bo! Bo!
It's goin' down
Bo!
Cause I'm around
Bo!
50 Cent, you know how I get's down
What up blood?
What?
What up cous?
What?
What up blood?
What?
What up gangsta?
What up blood?
What?
What up cous?
What?
What up blood?
What?
What up gangsta?
They say I walk around like I got an "S" on my chest
Naw, that's a semi-auto, and a vest on my chest
I try not to say nuttin' the DA might want to play in court
But I'll hunt or duck a nigga down like it's sport
Front on me, I'll cut ya, gun-butt ya or bump ya
You gettin money? I can't none with ya then fuck ya
I'm not the type to get knocked for D.W.I.
I'm the type that'll kill your connect when the coke price rise
Gangstas they bump my shit then they know me
I grew up around some niggas that's not my homies
Hundred G's I stash it what? The mack I blast it, yeah
D's come we dump the diesel and battery acid
This flow's been mastered, the ice I flash it
Chokes me, I'll have your mama pickin' out your casket bastard
I'm on the next level, right lane forget bezzle
Benz pedal to the metal, hotter than a tea kettle, blood.
What?
What up cous?
What?
What up blood?
What?
What up gangsta?
What up blood?
What?
What up cous?
What?
What up blood?
What?
What up gangsta?
We don't play that
We don't play that
We don't play that
G-Unit
We don't play around
I sit back, twist the best bud, burn and wonder
When gangstas bump my shit, can they hear my hunger?
When the fifth kick, duck quick, it sound like thunder
In December I'll make your block feel like summer
The rap critics say I can rhyme, the fiends say my dope is a nine
Every chick I fuck with is a dime
I'm like Patty LaBelle, homie, I'm on my own
Where I lay my hat is my home, I'm a rollin stone
Cross my path I'll crush ya, thinkin I won't touch ya
I'll have your ass usin a wheelchair, cane, or crutches
Industry hoe fuckers, in the hood they love us
Stomp a bone out your ass with some brand new chuckas.
What up blood?
What?
What up cous?
What?
What up blood?
What?
What up gangsta?
What up blood?
What?
What up cous?
What?
What up blood?
What?
What up gangsta?
We don't play that
We don't play that
We don't play that
G-Unit
We don't play around. 
We don't play that
We don't play that
We don't play that
G-Unit
We don't play around.
We don't play that
We don't play that
We don't play that
G-Unit
We don't play around.
We don't play that
We don't play that
We don't play that
G-Unit
We don't play around.
