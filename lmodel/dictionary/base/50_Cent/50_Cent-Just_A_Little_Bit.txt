Yeah... Shady....Aftermath.. G-Unit 
Damn baby all I need is a lil' bit... 
A lil bit o' dis a lil bit o' dat... 
Get crackin' in the club when you hear the shit.. 
Drop it like it's hot get to wokin that back.... 
Girl shake that thing yeah work that thing, 
Let me see it go up and down... 
Rotate that thing, I wanna touch that thing when you make it go round and round... 
I step up in the club I'm like who you with 
G-Unit in the house yeah that's my clique 
Yeah I'm young but a nigga from the old school, 
On a dance floor nigga doing old moves... 
I don't give a f**k I do what I wanna do, 
I hit your ass up boy I done warned you, 
Better listen when I talk nigga don't trip, 
Your heat in the club, mine's in this bitch, 
I ain't tryin' to beef I'm tryin' to get my drink on. 
I got my diamonds, my fitted, and my mink on.. 
I'm gonna kick it at the bar til it's time to go, 
Then I'm gonna get shorty here and I'm gonna let her know... 
[chorus] 
All a nigger really need is a lil bit, 
not a lot baby girl just a lil bit.. 
we can head to the crib in a lil bit.. 
I can show you how I live in a lil bit, 
I wanna unbutton your pants just a lil bit, 
take 'em off pull em down just a lil bit, 
get to kissin' and touchin' a lil bit... 
get to licking.. in a lil bit... 
[verse 2] 
This is 50 comin' out your stereo.. 
Hard to tell tho 'cause I switch the flow, 
Eyes a little low 'cause I twist tha dro 
Pockets on swoll 'cause I move the o's.. 
My neck, my wrist, my ears is froze 

Come get your bitch she on me dawg, 
She must a heard about the dough, 
Now captain c'mon and save a hoe. 
I get crunk in the club I'm off the chain 
#1 on the chart all the time mayne 
When the kid in the house I turn it out 
Keep the dance floor packed that's without a doubt 
Shorty shake that thing like a pro mayne 
She back dat up on me I'm like oh man 
I get close enough to her so I know she could hear it
System thumpin' party's jumpin I say it loud and clear. 
[chorus] 
All a nigger really need is a lil bit, 
not a lot baby girl just a lil bit.. 
we can head to the crib in a lil bit.. 
I can show you how I live in a lil bit, 
I wanna unbutton your pants just a lil bit, 
take 'em off pull em down just a lil bit, 
get to kissin' and touchin' a lil bit... 
get to lickin' it a lil bit... 
[bridge] 
You really got me feelin' right.. (ya heard me) 
My mama gone you can spend the night (ya heard me) 
I ain't playin' I'm tryin' to f**k tonight (ya heard me) 
Clothes off, face down, ass up, c'mon (haha). 
[chorus 2x] 
All a nigger really need is a lil bit, 
not a lot baby girl just a lil bit.. 
we can head to the crib in a lil bit.. 
I can show you how I live in a lil bit, 
I wanna unbutton your pants just a lil bit, 
take 'em off pull em down just a lil bit, 
get to kissin' and touchin' a lil bit... 
get to lickin' it a lil bit...
