I get money, I get money, I get I get I get money (50)
[Chorus]
I get money, money is got (I I get it)
I get money, money is got (I I get it)

I get money, money is got (I I get it)

I get money, money is got (Yeah yeah)
Money I got, money is got (I run New York!)
[Verse 1]
I take quarter water sold it in bottles for 2 bucks,
Coca-Cola came and bought it
For billions, what the fuck?
Have a baby by me; baby
Be a millionaire
I write the check before the baby comes,
Who the fuck cares
Im stanky rich
Ima die tryna spend this shit
Southside's up in this bitch
Yeah i smell like the vault
I used to sell dope
I did play the block
Now i play on boats
In the south of France
Baby, St. Tropez
Get a tan? im already black
Rich? I'm already that
Gangsta, get a gat
Hit a head in a hat
Call that a riddle rap
Shit, fuck the chitter chat
I'm the baker, i bake the bread
The barber, i cut ya head
The marksman, i spray the lead
"I blood clot, chop ya leg"
Do not fuck with the kid
I get biz wit the cigg
I come where you live
Ya dig?
[Chorus:]
I get money, money is got (I I get it)
I get money, money is got (I I get it)
I get money, money is got (Yeah)
Money I got, money is got (I run New York!)
I get money, money is got (I I get it)
I get money, money is got (I I get it)
I get money, money is got (Yeah yeah)
Money I got, money is got (I run New York!)
[Verse 2]
You can call this my new shit
But it aint new tho
I got rid of my old bitch
Now i got new hoes
First is was the Benzo
Now im in the Enzo, Ferrari, im sorry!
I keep blowin up! (Oh!!)
They call me the cake man
The strawberry shake man
I spray the AR
Make your whole click breakdance
Backspin, headspin, flatline, ya dead then
9 shells, Mac-10,
"Who wan get it crackin?!"
I was young, i couldnt do good
Now i cant do bad
I ride, wreck the new Jag
I just buy the new Jag
Now nigga why you mad?
Oh you cant do that
Im so forgetful, they callin me cocky
I come up out the jewler, they callin me Rocky
Its the ice on my neck man, the wrist and my left hand
Bling like BLAOW
You like my style
Ha ha im headin to the bank right now
[Chorus:]
I get money, money is got (I I get it)
I get money, money is got (I I get it)

Money I got, money is got (I run New York!)
Yeah, I talk the talk, and I walk the walk
Like a teflon Don, but i run New York
When i come outta court, yea i pop the Colt
I keep it gangsta, have ya outlined in chalk

In the hood if ya ask about me
Theyll tell ya im bout my bread
