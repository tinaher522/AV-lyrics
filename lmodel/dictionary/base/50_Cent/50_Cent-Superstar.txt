<song artist="50_Cent" title="Superstar">
Yeah, you gon' like this one, new 50 Cent
We call this one 'Ghetto Superstar'
Now I shouldn't have to tell you, you should know I'm a superstar
Now bitch, come grab my bags, be a part of my entourage
Now once I say G-Unit, you should know just who we are
Lloyd Banks, Young Buck, Tony Yayo, 50 Cent, we superstars
Now I shouldn't have to tell you, you should know I'm a superstar
Now bitch, come grab my bags, be a part of my entourage
Now once I say G-Unit, you should know just who we are
Lloyd Banks, Young Buck, Tony Yayo, 50 Cent, we superstars
Let's rock 'n' roll, baby, lock and load, baby
You think I ain't runnin' the show, you got to be crazy
I explode on the scene like crack in the '80s
Rather catch a slug, then let a nigga play me
I'm the don of New York, bow down to your highness
Or go against the grain and get moved on with llamas
Rappers keep sayin' they bringin' New York back
I ain't go no where, I am New York, jack
I should buy a plane and write it in the sky
50 run this motherfucker, cocksuckers
In the back of the Phantom playin' songs from the map
With a model bitch bobbin' and weavin' in my lap
It's up and down, baby, up and down
I like dat, yeah, I like that
Anyway, any day, we could play, it's okay
We could lay by the bay in L.A., I'll pay
Smoke a tray, sniff the yay', she could stay here with me
We can catch a matin√©e or fly away
We can go to Vegas, hang out with some of my friends, you know
I got some really, really, rich friends, man, real rich friends
Floyd Mayweather, the champ, we should go hang out with him
You know, the strip clubs or somethin'
Now I shouldn't have to tell you, you should know I'm a superstar
Now bitch, come grab my bags, be a part of my entourage
Now once I say G-Unit, you should know just who we are
Lloyd Banks, Young Buck, Tony Yayo, 50 Cent, we superstars
I'm a ghetto star, started out with less than nothin'
Got a little money, now I'm on to somethin'
You know a special man need a special woman
The type before you call, she already comin'
You know, the kind to listen when you tellin' her somethin'
First sign of a problem, she ain't runnin'
Buy her expensive shit, she don't want it
Sounds like I wouldn't need a prenup, don't it? Damn
Now that, that, that's hot right there, you know what I'm sayin'?
Man, I'm feelin' me right now, man, I'm really feelin' me right now
Matter of fact, I'm lovin' me right now, you know what I mean?
I'd like to just run down to the Justice Of Peace
And marry me right now, you know what I mean?
This is unbelievably good, man, this is 50 Cent
This is back, I'm in rare form
The streets is gon' love this, because this is for the streets
You know what I mean?
I don't get no money off of this, I'm doin' this for fun
You know what I mean? Listen
This is, this is what I call lovin' man, you understand what I'm sayin'?
I wanna just kiss me right now, you know what I mean?
Oh baby, oh damn
Now I shouldn't have to tell you, you should know I'm a superstar
Now bitch, come grab my bags, be a part of my entourage
Now once I say G-Unit, you should know just who we are
Lloyd Banks, Young Buck, Tony Yayo, 50 Cent, we superstars
Now I shouldn't have to tell you, you should know I'm a superstar
Now bitch, come grab my bags, be a part of my entourage
Now once I say G-Unit, you should know just who we are
Lloyd Banks, Young Buck, Tony Yayo, 50 Cent, we superstars
I want you to love me, I know you do
