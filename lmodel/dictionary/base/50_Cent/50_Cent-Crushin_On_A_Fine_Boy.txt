*crushin..
on you boy...
*come on over hear..
and taste this..
*Boy i'm watching you, everywhere you go
I see you at school, the parties too
*Why dontchu you notice me
I've been waiting for so long
*just come taste my candy..
I've been cruchin on a boy like you
*I've been waiting for you to come through
Just go knock at my door
*I'll let you in for alittle more
Just take a sample of my candy..
Late at night all I think about is you
The way you smell and how your body looks too
I just can't get you outta my mind
I wanna taste your body all the time
Everyday when I see your smile
my body melts into an ice-cream pile
I get so nervous when you talk to me
But after all you make me so happy
I've been cruchin on a boy like you
*I've been waiting for you to come through
Just go knock at my door
*I'll let you in for alittle more
Just take a sample of my candy..
alalalala..alalalala tastes like candy
alalalala..alalalala sweet n sexy
Boy wontchu taste my candy 
its so tastey and yummy
You will feel like your in heaven
cuz i'm cruching on you! repeat(2x)
