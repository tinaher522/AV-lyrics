I Know I Can
Be what I wanna be 
If I work hard and get
I be where I wanna be
I Know I Can
i Know I can
Be what I wanna be
Be what I wanna be
If I work hard and get
If I work hard and get
I be where I wanna be
I be where I wanna be
be be 
Boys &amp; Girls listen up 
you can be anything in the world
In God we trust an Artictec, Doctor maybe an Actress
But nothing comes easy it take much practice
Like I meet woman who's becoming a star
She was very beautiful leaving people in awww
Singing song leanin horn but with the yellow version
Hung with the wrong person got 
Stiffen up drugs all in the nose 
could of died so young 
know look ugly and old
no fun cause now when she reaches for a hugs
people hold there breath
cause she smells like corrosion and death
watch the company you keep and the crowed you bring
cause they came to do drugs and you came to sing
so if you gonna be the best ima tell you how 
put your hand into the air and take a bow
I know i can
I know I can
Be what I wanna be
Be what I wanna be
If I work hard and get
If I work hard and get
I be where I wanna be
I be where I wanna be
I know i can
I know I can
Be what I wanna be
Be what I wanna be
If I work hard and get
If I work hard and get
I be where I wanna be
I be where I wanna be
be be 
Boys &amp; Girls listen again
this is for grown looking girls who only ten
the one who watch video and do what they see
as cuteiste can be up in the club with fake i.d.
Careful before you meet a men with H.I.V.
You can host a t.v. like Orpra Winfree
What ever you decide be careful some men be rapist or at your age don't betted to be older then you are give yourself time to grow you thinking he can give you wealth
but soo................. 
young boys you can use a lot of help u know 
you thinkin life is all about smokein (pot) and ice
you don't want to be my age and cant read or wright begging different women for a place to sleep at night
smart boy turn emmm in and do whatever they wish 
if you believe you can achieve then say it like this
I know i can
I know I can
Be what I wanna be
Be what I wanna be
If I work hard and get
If I work hard and get
I be where I wanna be
I be where I wanna be
I know i can
I know I can
Be what I wanna be
Be what I wanna be
If I work hard and get
If I work hard and get
I be where I wanna be
I be where I wanna be
