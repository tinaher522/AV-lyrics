(feat. Tony Yayo, Lloyd Banks)
[Chorus:]
Is Is the Unit Is Is the Unit
Coke Life what's the matter with your clothes
Coke Life did you put it all in your nose
Coke Life every body can't be on top
Coke Life call me when it's time to cop
[50 Cent:]
I got 99 bottle of beer on the wall and 99 grams left to flips that's all
Like toasting a stagier I'll show you how to cut this quick
Double up out this bitch The D's know me
I'm the one that got away
Ask the homies they'll tell you about the way
I'm a hustla I got it in my blood
I'm still hungry I'm out to get it just because
One Coupe One block one spot it's not enough
Were taking over like the old heads told us yeah!
[Chorus:]
Coke Life what's the matter with your clothes
Coke Life did you put it all in your nose
Coke Life every body can't be on top
Coke Life call me when it's time to cop
[Tony Yayo:]
Listen I got that white girl on Pablo shit
Looking like a glass of milk on my diablo bitch
Remember packs on my ass with the due, due brown stains
Now it's rose gold rims and the due, due drown Range
I hear 50 giving Michel Jack money for this shows
1.4 ask Mateo Hundred gran from me buy some Yayo
Turn it into a mill I stretch to Yayo
Stay in the shoot out Yay, lay low naw man my 44 blows
Million brake head ma I live lavige I kill a Nigga
Quicker to do 20 days like Paris Hilton
The crystal spillan 50 chillan Yayo Chillan
Vitamin water had us 400 million
Coke cola bought for 4 big billion!
[Chorus:]
Is Is the Unit Is Is the Unit
Coke Life what's the matter with your clothes
Coke Life did you put it all in your nose
Coke Life every body can't be on top
Coke Life call me when it's time to cop
[Lloyd Banks:]
As the world rotates my cake gets bigger
Rap stops selling I'm gonna cook this Nigga
Blue cooler than a Mac out the movies
I'll pull sits back and brought a bag out of groupie
If you don't back up my boy back up the oosie
Knock, knock nothing but brains and chop cuie
I got a queens lean and crook I bought shit
Alcohol and coke took my pops yeah nigga
[Chorus:]
Coke Life what's the matter with your clothes
Coke Life did you put it all in your nose
Coke Life every body can't be on top
Coke Life call me when it's time to cop
