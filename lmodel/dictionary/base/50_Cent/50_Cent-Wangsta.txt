<song artist="50_Cent" title="Wangsta">
Yeah, its Fifty, a.k.a Ferrari, F-Fifty
Break it down
I got alot of livin' to do 'fore I die
And I ain't got time to waste, let's make it
You say you a gangsta but you neva popped nothin'
You say you a wanksta, then you need to stop frontin'
You ain't a friend of mine, you ain't no kin of mine
What makes you think that I won't run up on you with the nine?
We do this all the time, right now we on the grind
So hurry up and cop and go, we sellin' nick's and dimes
Shorty she so fine, I gotta make her mine
An ass like that got to be one of a kind
I question every town, punch in with every line
I'm fuck'n with they mind, I make 'em press rewind
They know they can't shine if I'm around to rhyme
Been on parole since '94 'cause I commit the crimes
I stay in my line, I did it through the nine
The d's ran up in my crib, you know who droppin' dimes
You say you a gangsta but you neva popped nothin'
You say you a wanksta, then you need to stop frontin'
You go to the dealership but you ain't never cop nothin'
You been hustlin' a long time and you ain't got nothin'
You say you a gangsta, but you neva popped nothin'
You say you a wanksta, then you need to stop frontin'
You go the dealership but you ain't never cop nothin'
You been hustlin' a long time and you ain't got nothin'
Damn, homey, in high school you was the man, homey
What the fuck happened to you?
I got the sickest vendetta when it come to the cheddar
But if you play with my paper, you gone meet me, Beretta
Now shorty, think I'mma sweat her sippin' on Amaretto
I might hit once, then date her, I know I can do better
She look good but I know she after my cheddar
She tryin' to get in my pockets, homey, and I ain't gone let her be easy
Start some bullshit, you get ya whole crew wet
We in the club doin' the same old two step
Gorilla unit 'cause they say we bugged out
'Cause we dont go nowhere without toasters we thugged out
You say you a gangsta but you neva popped nothin'
You say you a wanksta then you need to stop frontin'
You go to the dealership but you ain't never cop nothin'
You been hustlin' a long time and you ain't got nothin'
You say you a gangsta but you neva popped nothin'
You say you a wanksta, then you need to stop frontin'
You go to the dealership but you ain't never cop nothin'
You been hustlin' a long time and you ain't got nothin'
Me, I'm no mobsta, me, I'm no gangsta
Me, I'm no hit man, me, I'm just me, me
Me, I'm no wanksta, me, I'm no actor
But it's me you see on your TV 'cause I hustle weed
Smashin' shit is so easy
I'm gettin' what you get for a brick to talk greasy
By any means partner I got to eat on these streets
And you play me close, for sure I'mma gon' pop my heat
Niggas sayin' they gone merk, Fifty, how?
We ridin' around wit guns the size of Lil' Bow Wow
What you know about AKs and AR-15s
Equipped with night visions, shell cases and M beams
You say you a gangsta but you neva popped nothin'
You say you a wanksta, then you need to stop frontin'
You go to the dealership but you ain't never cop nothin'
You been hustlin' a long time and you ain't got nothin'
You say you a gangsta but you neva popped nothin'
You say you a wanksta, then you need to stop frontin'
You go to the dealership but you ain't never cop nothin'
You been hustlin' a long time and you ain't got nothin'
Damn homey
