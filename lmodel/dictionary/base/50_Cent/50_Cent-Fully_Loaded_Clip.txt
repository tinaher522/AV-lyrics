[Intro]
High-speed Ferrari movement
3rd lane switching lanes, whuddup?
Brooklyn, whuddup?
Fa'rock, whuddup?
[Chorus]
While Jay and Beyonce was (Mm mm), kissin'
I was cookin' one-thousand grams in my kitchen
While Nas was tellin' Kelis, "I love you boo"
I was shinin' my nine, ya know how I do
I got a fully loaded clip, I be on dat shit
I got-I got a fully loaded clip
I got a fully loaded clip, I be on dat shit (Yeah)
I got-I got a fully loaded clip
[Verse 1]
You wann' problem wit' me? - No problem, it's all good
I ain't fresh out the hood, I'm still in the hood
Black rims, black henny, nigga see me when ya see me
I appear and disappear wit' the heata like Houdini
They parry wit' bullshiit - git'cha azz popped
Don't believe me - ask Fam, they got his head shot
I'm in the cut like germs, I do durrt like worms
Smoke weed, now I'm sure, nigga it's my turn
I fire on ya azz, dem hollow-tips burn, baby burn
I'm screamin' "Fuck the cops!", 'fore I 'round my glock
Test my pistol on my bitch, nigga fuck dat box!
Dat's how P. got knocked, dat's how jewl got drop
But Dre beat dat nigga, go 'head, repeat dat nigga
You might learn a lil' summin' if you learn to stop frontin'
My nigga look easy on three p's b-p's, rollin' locc-in'
I'm runnin' wit' the Dope-man
[Chorus]
When Jenny and Jumaine was (Mm mm), kissin'
I was baggin' one-thousand grams in my kitchen
When Puffy just tellin' Cam, "I love you boo"
I was shinin' my nine, ya know how I do
I got a fully loaded clip, I be on dat shit
I got-I got a fully loaded clip
I got a fully loaded clip, I be on dat shit
I got-I got a fully loaded clip
[Verse 2]
Have the dice game, I'm bet it all, you hear what I'm sayin'?
Take grand and I fall betta nigga, I ain't playin'
I tryinna git it, holla at me if ya wit' it
And lace up the chuckas, wit' canÂ ? mothafuckas
My stomach is growlin', they say dat I'm wyllin'
I'm doin' my numbas, I'm gittin' violent
They hearin' me rap and they think dat I'm playin'
Till they see the barrel and they see the flame
I need full co-operation man, give us the chain
The watch, the ring and the grill - we ain't playin'
I fire dat thang, it sound insane
Holla, I got dat news candi mayne
[Chorus]
When Jeezy and Keysha was (Mm mm), kissin'
I was baggin' one-thousand grams in my kitchen
When Trina was tellin' Wayne, I love you boo
she was just runnin' games, she told Buck dat too
I got a fully loaded clip, I be on dat shit
I got-I got a fully loaded clip
I got a fully loaded clip, I be on dat shit
I got-I got a fully loaded clip
[Outro w/ ad-libin "I got-I got fully loaded clip"]
Now nigga, lemme show ya whudd I do this right here!
Now, the rugger hold 16!
I put 16 in the clip, I put it in - I got dat!
One in the head, 'till it fell!
I put anutha one in it the clip, I put it back!
Let the bullets burn!
