<song artist="50_Cent" title="New_Day">
It don't take much strength to pull a trigger
But try to get up every morning day after day and work for a living
Let's see 'em try that
Then we'll see who's the real tough guy
The working man is a tough guy
Party people say, party people say
Ay, it's a new day, it's a new day
World is getting ready, everybody ready, yeah
For a new day, for a new day, celebrate and say
A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-Ay
A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-Ay
A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-Ay
A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-Ay
I woke up this morning thinking 'bout the old me
When I was feeling like, Miller Lite and Old E
But now I ride on some conscious shit
I'm getting bread while I toast to my accomplishments
Only one I can have a problem with is myself
It's probably why my only competition is myself
From today to the morning, the Doctor just rock to the same drum
Fuck the past though I ain't forgot where I came from
Uh, I got the club rocking
Uh, I got your girl jocking
Uh, me and Fif' still in this bitch
We going the distance with you party people, come on
Party people say, party people say
Ay, it's a new day, it's a new day
World is getting ready, everybody ready, yeah
For a new day, for a new day, celebrate and say
A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-Ay
A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-Ay
A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-Ay
A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-Ay
Yeah, now you can get your knees on the church floor break it better
Or push the door on the liquor store, see where it get ya
But me I got to be on top, I said me I get to be on top
I got the street on lock
I'm on automatic pilot, ain't nobody starting me
Growing up in poverty ain't filled my heart with larceny
Niggas ride out on high, I jump to get 'em off of me
I'm a leader, look and see the natural-born boss of me
They from Bel Air, I'm from the bottom,
Soon as I spot 'em, I get to drop 'em, I got 'em I cock my piece and red dot 'em
It's dinner time when the 9 come out
It's off with chain, off with the ring, move bang, off with ya brain now
Party people say, party people say
Ay, it's a new day, it's a new day
World is getting ready, everybody ready, yeah
For a new day, for a new day, celebrate and say
A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-Ay
A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-Ay
A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-Ay
A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-Ay
Marks on the wall
It's now or never at all
I'm gonna give it my all, oh oooh
Whether I rise or fall, oh oooh
True story, I said I'd get rich or die trying
I did it, good luck sucker, try'na stop my shine
Nothing matters but the music, music my first love
We paper chasing, I'm always coming in first 'cuz
I'm built for it, see I'm better under pressure
I react like a maniac when I'm coming to get ya
I got to win, Em' watching and Dre watching and my son watching
Fuck that, losing ain't an option
I'm sharp I'm on point, the ink from my ballpoint
Throwing out my pain, I'm back on my A-game
I'm focused, for me this is just another victory
Except that I'm stronger than an ox now mentally
Party people say, party people say
Ay, it's a new day, it's a new day
World is getting ready, everybody ready, yeah
For a new day, for a new day, celebrate and say
A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-Ay
A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-Ay
A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-Ay
A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-Ay
