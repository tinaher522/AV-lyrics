Chourus:
If it had not been for the Lord,
Who was on my side,
I wanna know where I'd be,
If it had not been for the Lord,
Who was on my side
I wanna know where I'd be
v1
When I think about all the many times
That I could have been cast away,
And God's love and grace sold my destiny,
and he kept me from all tragedy
Each and everyday as I kneel and pray
And ask the Lord for one more chance,
New mercy that He let me see
That's why I can sing and dance
Chourus
v2
Remember the time when I thought that I
Was just about to loose my mind,
Lost in despair, thought no one cared, 
Headed down the road to nowhere,
I can look back and see everything God's done for me,
Through dangers seen and unseen
The Lord show protected me.
Bridge
Where would I be (If He hadn't kept me)
What would I say (If He hadn't shown me)
How would I know (If the Lord hadn't kept me)
Through all of my ups and downs He's the best friend I 
have found
I don't know what I would do if it had not been for the
Lord on my side.
Chourus
If it had not been for it (3x)
For the Lord on my side
If had not been for it (3x)
I don't know where I would be.
