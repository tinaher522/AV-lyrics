<song artist="50_Cent" title="50_Bars">
50 bars of pleasure 50 bars of pain
When I'm dead and gone niggaZ gonna remember my name 50
(repeat)
Yo black is flashy like Alpo gun happy like Pappy
Sneaky muthafucka remind me of nigga that clap me
He ain't the type you shoot dice with and win dog
Unless you try'na get your ass layed out in gilmore
Yes we soldiers, remind me of Troy and E-Bags 
When they came through they hollad like "What up Conrad?"
Grimey niggaz they loved to get gully
Summer time still had on black gloves and scullies
The Lex 450 pulled up that's Cornbread
Them niggaZ from Philly would of called him an old head
But he an OG remind me of ChaZ and Bump real low key
Sounded like he didn't know nothing about drama
For this money shit many men do trauma
Switchy walked in son, this bitch had the baddest ass
The bulletproof glass was rolled up on the S-Class
Heard in DC he kept mad blocks in order 
Picture this a young nigga gettin it like Rich Porter
Sonny came in for half a pit
He got knocked, he on lock still controllin' his spot from constop
Pop pulled up in the CL5 his project changed 
His man just got fucking murked by Salene
Heard he got it in the range nigga came popped one in his brain
Over some-thing took his watch and his chain
Country boys off the hook down there in Richmond main.
In the black 740 I sat, my hat turned back
Bow down baby nelly singing my wrist blinging What!
I'm waiting on this nigga Wise we lost for two pies
Son he smokin that shit I can see it in his eyes
Comin up wise emotions closed
An' most buying round looking for wisemen toast
Benny hopped out the Esculade with a few thourough men from B-More
They sellin herion in Maryland reverse back to diesel
Killed like 4 fiends his popularity grew that only ment more cream
First it was him and his brother now he got a team
Went from 5 and a half grams to living the dream
City pulled up Goddamn you know his format
Bentley is all marble in the door and floor match
Get the hats out the stash box popped two glocks
Peace "All eyeZ on me" 2pac
Everybody knows he a boss he still gotta floss
He on the same bullshit that sent Gotti up north
That's Dime in the blue TS stunting like he Nicky Barnes
He broke but he talk like a Don
Homes hoppin out the Jag that's Max haitin cat
Kill a nigga quick remind me of Haitian Jack
I peep his style son I know his steelo, He on the d-low
He smile at niggaZ mumbling fuck you in Creole
Heard war stories bout how he maneuver with the Ruger
Hold the iron horiZontally and send shots throug h ya
Few niggaZ tried to murk him, most them got found
Some turned away try to run they in wheelchairs now 
Banks hopped out bulletproof this, bulletproof that
Bulletproof snorkel, bulletproof hat
Got out a Black Hummer he blew 90 on that
Poppin mad shit like he gonna bulletproof that lets go
