Verse 1
I Apply Pressure To Pussys That Stuntin' I Pop
Stand Alone, Squeezin Ma Pistol, I'm Sure That I Got em
Now Peter Piper Picked Peppers But Don't Rocked Rhymes
I'm 50 Cent, I Write A Lil' Bit But I Pop Nines..
Tell Niggas Get They Money Right Cuz I Got Mine
And I'm Around Quit playin' Nigga...U Can't Shine
U Gon' Be That Next Chump To End Up In The Trunk
After Bein' Hit By The Pump, Is That What U Want??
Be Easy Nigga, I'll Lay Ur Ass Out!
Believe Me Nigga, Thats What I'm About, Gangsta!
U Could Find A Nigga Sittin' On Chrome
Hit The Clutch, Hit The Gear, Hit The Gas &amp; I'm Gone(Yeah!)

Oh No! Look Who Clappin' Whit The Fo-Fo!

Niggas Don't Rob Me They Know I'm Down To Die For Ma Chain
G-Unit! (Yeah!) We Get It Poppin' In The Hood
G-Unit! (Yeah!) Mothafucka Whats Good??
I'm Waitin' On Niggas To Act Like They Don't Know How To Act

*Verse 3*
I Been Feelin' I Had To Teach Lessons To Slow Learners
Go Head Act Up, Get Smacked In The Head With The Burner
I Don't Fight Fair, I'm Dirty-Dirty
I'm From SouthSide Jamaica, Queens, Nigga Ya Heard Me??
When StreetLights Come On Niggas blast The Nines
Get Locked Up, They Read Books To Pass The Time
In The Game There's Ups And Downs, So I Stay On The Grind
Niggas On Ma Dick More Than Ma Bitch, I Stay On They Mind
They Ain't Nothin' They Could Do To Stop Ma Shine
This Is God's Plan Homie, This Ain't Mine!
I Played The Music Loud So GrandPa Called Me A Nuisance
And GrandMa, Who Always Gotta Throw In Her 2 Cents
I'm The Drop Out Who Made More Money Than His Teachers
RuthLess like The Coupe But I Come With More Features
I Am What I Am, U Could Like It Or Love It!
It Feels Good To Pull 50 Grand &amp; Think Nothin' Of It..
Fuck It!
Chorus
If I Can't Do It, Homie, It Can't Be Done!
Now Im'a Let The Champagne Bottle Pop
Im'a Take It To The Top 
Fo'Sho Im'a Make It Hot Baby (Baby)
If I Can't Do It, Homie, It Can't Be Done!
Now Im'a Let The Champagne Bottle Pop
Im'a Take It To The Top 
Fo'Sho Im'a Make It Hot Baby (Baby)
