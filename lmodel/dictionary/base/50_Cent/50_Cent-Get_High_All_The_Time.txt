[Intro:]
[2 sniffles]
Hey, you want this shit?
Stat quit talk... {NONE STOP! } Cali blow!
[Chorus:]
I don't need Don Perignon, I don't need Cris!
Tanqueray and Alize, I don't need shit!
Nigga, I'm high all the time...
I smoke that good shit.
I stay high all the time...
Man I'm on some hood shit. {+SMOKIN' DAY... +! }
Give me some dro, purple haze and some chocolate {+PART 2+! }
Give me a Dutch and a lighter I'll spark shit!
And stay high all the time...
I smoke that good shit!
I'm high all the time...
Man, I'm on some hood shit! {SADA POP! }
[Bridge 1:]
Everytime I ROLL up, niggaz holla ROLL up,
And I tell 'em HOLD up.
You ain't gettin' money you ain't smoking in my Benzo
20 inch Lorenzos, smoking on Indo.
Hiiigh as a motherfucker; {Whooooo! } I be on them backstreets, niggaz know I clap heat,
Only if you got beef, man you better holla at me.
Niggaz get locked up, stabbed up, shot up
Everytime I pop up, a lot going on in my hood... {YEAH! }
[Verse 1:]
I shoot the dice, I holler get'em girls, daddy need new shoes
Daddy need Perelli's to look mean on 22's. {Whoooo! }
Stash-box, Xbox, laptop, fax machine, phone
Bulletproof this bitch and I'm gone! [car tires squeal]
2003 Suburban swerving - too many sips of Henny (yeah!)
The D's sick they searched the whip and they can't find the Semis. (whooo!)
They was just harassing me 'cause they know who I was
Spent the night in Central Booking for smoking some Bud... {34... SHOT! }
[Chorus:]
I don't need Don Perignon, I don't need Cris!
Tanqueray and Alize, I don't need shit.
Nigga I'm high all the time...
I smoke that good shit.
I stay high all the time...
Man I'm on some hood shit.
Give me some dro, purple haze and some chocolate! {CAN'T FORGET... }
Give me a Dutch and a lighter! {HAPOO! } I'll spark shit
And stay high all the time... {REENA! }
I smoke that good shit.
I'm high all the time... {JOHN! }
Man I'm on some hood shit.
[Bridge 2: 50 Cent sings]
Now if you heard I done started some shit
It ain't because I be high. (I be high... I be high...) {NONE STOP! }
And if you heard I done let off a clip
It ain't because I be high. (I be high... I be high...)
But I...
Twist that la-la-la-la. {Whoooo! }
[Verse 2:]
I get high as I wanna nigga
Go against me, fo' sho, you'sa goner nigga.
I don't smoke to calm my nerves but I got beef
Finna crush my enemies {CAN'T FORGET... } like I crush the Hashish. {ROB RAPS! }
If you love me, tell me you love me - don't stare at me man!
I'd hate to be in the Benz clapping one of my fans.
Let me show you how to greet me, when you meet me, when you see me
If you real my nigga - you know how to holla: "G-Unit! " {SMOKED UP! }
There's no competition, it's just me,
50Cent, motherfucker, I'm hot on these streets.
If David could go against Goliath with a stone
I can go at NaS and Jigga - both for the throne. {Whoooo! }
[Chorus:]
I don't need Don Perignon, I don't need Cris!
Tanqueray and Alize, I don't need shit.
Nigga I'm high all the time...
I smoke that good shit.
I stay high all the time...
Man I'm on some hood shit.
Give me some dro, purple haze {CAN'T FORGET... } and some chocolate!
Give me a Dutch {DON DIVA... } and a lighter I'll spark shit! {X.C.! }
And stay high all the time...
I smoke that good shit.
I'm high all the time...
Man I'm on some hood shit. {PHARELL! }
[Verse 3:]
Now who you know besides me who write lines and squeeze .9,
And have hoes in the hood sniffin' on white lines.
You don't want me to be your kid's role model,
I'll teach them how to buck them 380s and load up them hollows. [gun cocks] {YEAH! }
Have shorty fresh off the stoop - ready to shoot
Big blunt in his mouth, (uh-huh!) deuce deuce in his boot
Sit in the crib, sippin Guinness, watching Menace then: "Oh, Lord! "
Have a young nigga bucking shit like he O-Dog. (whooo!)
My team they depend on me when it's crunch time
I eat a nigga food in broad day like it's lunchtime.
You feeling brave nigga, go ahead - get gully!
See if I won't leave your brains leaking up out your skully. {Whooooo! }
I done made myself hot, so ain't shit you can tell me
Niggaz calling me to feature, maan, Fuck your money!
I ain't hurting, I'm doing good
I ain't got to write rhymes, I got bricks in the hood. {HAHA! }
[Chorus:]
I don't need Don Perignon, I don't need Cris!
Tanqueray and Alize, I don't need shit!
Nigga I'm high all the time...
I smoke that good shit!
I stay high all the time...
Man I'm on some hood shit!
Give me some dro, purple haze and some chocolate!
Give me a Dutch and a lighter I'll spark shit!
And stay high all the time...
I smoke that good shit!
I'm high all the time...
Man I'm on some hood shit!
[Outro:]
G-UNIT! [beat stops]
{DAMN! }
