<song artist="50_Cent" title="Straight_To_The_Bank">
Yeah!!! When I'm out in N.Y. boy it's blunts and Phillies
When I'm out in L.A. boy it's wraps and swishes
Now Blood walk to this, now Crips walk to this
Now throw it up, raise it up for that gangster shit
Now Blood walk to this, now Crips walk to this
Now throw it up, raise it up for that gangster shit
Im in my lambo maggot
My fo fo fagget
Doors cliffed up im like go go gadget
See this shit I got on
Homie i'd hate to
My teflon on boy my goverment issue
I hit your vertebrate,bullet went through tissue
Your wife on the futon huggin her shit soon
Homie you a bitch you got feminime ways
Heard you got four lips and bleed for seven days
I got four fifths and bananas on the case
They got more whips than a runaway slave
Me and yayo go back like some high top fades
When I made 50 mil Em got paid
When I made 60 mil Dre got paid
When I made 80 mil Jimmy got paid
I ain't even got to rap
Now life is made
Said I aint even got to rap, i'm filthy man
I'm laughin straight to the bank with this (ha ha haha ha)x4
I'm laughin straight to the bank with this
I think nothin but hundred dollar bills on the bank role
I got the kind of money that the bank cant hold
Got off the street movin mongoose  and hoes
Seven three capris old school
When I role ways pass fuck the toe
No more paltinum i'm wearing gold
Im internationally known as the kid with the flow that brings enough dough
Theres never enough dough shit I need more
Get that shit out the stove baby blue was dough
Fresh off the flow stash blocks by the dash
Some by the wall make the purple bring the green and fuck the law
Im also raw im hot im sure im like the coolest motherfucka around the globe boy
I sent the club on fire I told ya im the general saluting his soldiers
I'm laughin straight to the bank with this (ha ha haha ha)x4
I'm laughin straight to the bank with this
Now work it out now
Shortie work it out, I want see you brake it down
Now back it up now ,you know what im about
Just like I bank job I'm in and I'm out
Now work it out now, work it out
Work it out, now work it out now, work it out, work it out
