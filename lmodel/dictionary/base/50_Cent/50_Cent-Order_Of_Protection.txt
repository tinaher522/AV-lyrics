<song artist="50_Cent" title="Order_Of_Protection">
Yeah
G-Unit nigger
50 Cent
You Heard Me
Irv I don't believe you let that nigger talk
You fat cupcake eatin' motherfucker
I'll fuck you up nigger
Fuckin' punk ass nigger
Don't nobody respect you nigger
You Preme's son nigger
Motherfucker's been gettin' extorted since day one
Its all kinda bitch in ya, Chinese, Spanish, black, white
I got X
Method slabs and cocaine
So the feds want to search us
Like Arabs boardin' the planes
I'm in the range
Switchin' lanes
Reminscin' on cans and sardines
And car dreams
I'm burnin' unfamiliar bud
Got a shotgun like Elmer Fudd
That'll let off and leave you hell-a blood
Ma I'm hip to the game
Blue ice chips in the chain
A few nights skipped on the plane
With two white chicks gettin' brain
Bang bang from big heaters
Hundred dollar sneakers
Two seaters
Two ninas
And a bundle of hayes
At least enough to last fourteen days
He wouldn't sell lobster
My eyes slanted like Pharell's partner
Nigger respect like your father when it comes to drama
I put the llama to your mama
And beat her like a pinata
Nigger I been hotter since '97
You been beggin' tha 5th kick like a kung-fu legend
One blue seven
What's poppin' nigger?
Different day same shit
What you coppin' nigger?
S-K's want bricks, shit
You wind up dead with this
So why turn soft?
Straight bullets will burn a niggers sideburns off
I gotta model with a sick ass
Bagged her off 5th ave.
Fucked her offa hot dog and a playoff Knick pass
Now we shoppin' in the malls on the west coast
And as far as pussy
I been through more walls than asbestos
So lets toast
And have a sex on the beach
These niggers quotin' my lines like a Martin Luther King speech
Remember Patrice
She looked like Kelis
Met her in club
And caught her eyein' my piece
And with all the birds at tha show
I had to fuck tha crazy hoe
Callin' Hot 97 'cause she knows I'm on tha radio
(Ha Ha Bitch)
Yeah
Ja you little Stuart Little lookin' motherfucker
Catch you I'll break your mothafuckin' neck nigger
You only weigh 110 pounds you little fagot
I know tha stylist you been fuckin' too nigger
I paid him 50,000
Check my album out nigger
February 11th you gonna hear him talk
You little bitch
Tryin' to jump off like its a promotional stunt
Seven days before your album drop
Huh... you little bitch
Order of protection
From who?
Who I need an order of protection from nigger? (Laughs)
Ya lil' k... awe man
Motherfuckers man
Y'all niggers is gonna make this a lot of fun for me
