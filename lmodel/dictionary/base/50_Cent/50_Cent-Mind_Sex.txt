<song artist="50_Cent" title="Mind_Sex">
Its 50, Yeah
It's time I laid back on Em',
Real smooth yeah.
[Chorus: x2]
I'm not down for the mind sex,
I'm tryin' to get some pussy and jet, 
you can burn an inncent.
Lay back and relax,
feal the good vibrations,
after me fuck I dont a conversation.
Pardon me love that ass lookin right,
what you doin' tonight,
you should stop aight.
My body language say it all,
so we ain't gotta talk.
I got fly spot southside queens New York.
Now you know I wanna fuck,
no doubt but I wanna try a different route,
Don't say a word,
un-button your blouse,
pull that skirt down.
Come to my bed time to put it down.
[Chorus: x2]
I'm not down for the mind sex,
I'm tryin' to get some pussy and jet, 
you can burn an inncent.
Lay back and relax,
feal the good vibrations,
after we fuck I dont a conversation.
New princess show me your interests,
wait let me guess you like my ghetto poetry.
Here's a little something I wrote down,
incase you ever came around,
you hear that fly shit,
you know it's me.
Position after position,
I'll exploit your body, 
like an instuctor for yoga or advanced pilates.
Your working up a sweat,
you like it how I like it?
Go ahead go up and down,
I like it when you ride it.
[Chorus: x2]
I'm not down for the mind sex,
I'm tryin' to get some pussy and jet, 
you can burn an inncent.
Lay back and relax,
feal the good vibrations,
after we fuck I dont a conversation.
Mother fuckin right I dont want no conversation,
talk to a bitch try to explain to her why she should give me some boyzes and the bitch slow. First she know then she dont know if she gunna give some boyzes, she slow. So I ain't supposed to be hangin out with no mentally retarted hoe, you know shit like that, you know what I'm sayin'? It's the kid man, It's the 50 man. Come on man, I'm in Taiwan man,type A, Thiland, 
I got the Asian hoes man, all together man. Niggas dont even believe in me man. I gotta put this shit on tape man, 4 bitches at the same time man, theres a difference when you just got 4 bitches, there just is. You or when you got 4 bitches that are just dead, really get into it, start being there for themselves, you know what I mean? I talk A bitch into anything man. You gotta listen o me man, I'm good at this man, yous dont be listenin man. Thats why you ain't got no money man. Put your hands in your pockets right now. You know why you aint got no money? Cause you dont listen to 50. Stupid nigga, I'm tellin ya to pay attention man. Watch me man, hunh? Niggas know what im sayin'. I'm off the same curb you are. Why I got a hundred mill' and you aint got nuttin, hunh?
