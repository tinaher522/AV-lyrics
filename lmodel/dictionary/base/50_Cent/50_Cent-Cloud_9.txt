<song artist="50_Cent" title="Cloud_9">
Its more mental then physical
Its more then sexin' we gotta connection
Be my angel and ill be your protection
If you grind when i grind when i shine i see to it you shine
I'm all ears tell me what's on your mind
If you feel like i feel its real if I'm gettin' ahead of myself tell me chill
But if you let me touch ya i could touch ya how you need to be touched
Keep talkin' to me girl and I'm gon be the one that you trust
I'll bring them candles bring them roses and them boxes of candy
You bring them sorted flavored condoms and them edible panties
Yea I'm street but I'm discreet baby i can keep a secret
You can show me what you hidin' in them Victoria Secrets
Gotta old soul so you know i listen to Marvin "Let's get it on"
I take it off for you no problem you can call when you need baby
And we can pass time on that cloud with the silver line number nine
I was raised in a way where the time was the day was to play hard to get babe
But then it changed suddenly man you came and took my breath away
I was caught in a vine at a time in the night where my life wasn't right babe
But then again suddenly suddenly you came and i was swept away
Ooh like a bird i just fly 'cause I'm free
Free to laugh free to love free to be
No rain comes down on me
This is what's happenin'
La la la la la la la
Floatin' all the time on cloud nine
La la la la la la la
High every night from your light
La la la la la la la
Floatin' all the time on cloud nine
La la la la la la
Now this can't be a faze it runs threw my veins
So i can't get it out of me its so complete
Its makin' me feel like I'm the only one that it is
So i don't care where we lay anytime of the day any way it don't matter babe
This unexplainable feeling its so soul healing
And i want it all over me
Ooh like a bird i just fly 'cause I'm free
Free to laugh free to love free to be
No rain comes down on me
This is what's happenin'
La la la la la la la
Floatin' all the time on cloud nine
La la la la la la la
High every night from your light
La la la la la la la
Floatin' all the time on cloud nine
La la la la la la
I like to lay around in the sun spendin' time
Sip on moses on a quite evenin' night
Get away on a trip catch a flight
When yo say to me I'm the only one you need
I let you taste my body spot just to teeze
I want to sing while you kiss all ova me
Ooh la la
La la la la la la la
Floatin' all the time on cloud nine
La la la la la la la
High every night from your light
La la la la la la la
Floatin' all the time on cloud nine
La la la la la la
