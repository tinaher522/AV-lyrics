[50 Cent:]
R.I.P. B.I.G. man ya'll niggas have some audacity
Sell four mill then get half of me
Get off my dick
I'm the shit
I know ya'll niggas copying my style
[Chorus: 50 Cent]
They stay at home
All alone
In the zone
Bumpin' 50's shit
That gangsta music
It makes 'em wanna grab the chrome
And just roam
On they own
And do it how the gangstas do it
[50 Cent:]
You niggas want problems you all welcome
Franks not around anymore
New Yorks mine
[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Blood set, Crip set
Gangsta, respect
I give niggas the green light to get ya whole click wet
You been rappin' a long time you ain't got chips yet
You had that ounce a whole week nigga you ain't flip yet
Before I leave the crib I make sure I don't forget shit
Mac check
Clip check
Vest check
I'm ready to roll
Its no contest I'm the Codeez from the East
Niggas mad I'm doin' good so I wake up to new beef
Niggas sayin' "I knew 50 back when he was Boo"
"When he used to pump crack on Guy Brew"
"Before he blew"
Then when they come through
Sayin' whats up I'm like "Who are you"
We ain't ever made no money together so we ain't cool
Cocaine, baking soda, a pot full of boiling water I'll teach you how to cook crack
Nigga how you like that?
Turn a buck into a stack
Man I mean a G-Stack
Just took it from 3 and a half to 14 you peep that
Smoke shit, pop shit on the low nigga
We roll shit, smoke shit pass the dro nigga
[Chorus: 50 Cent]
They stay at home
All alone
In the zone
Bumpin' 50's shit
That gangsta music
It makes 'em wanna grab the chrome
And just roam
On they own
And do it how the gangstas do it
[50 Cent:]
Yeah man keep it real gangsta
You know what I'm sayin'?
November 4th G Unit album in stores
November 4th G Unit sneakers in stores
Its goin' down like that you know what I'm sayin'?
Silverback Gorillas in the concrete jungle baby
You gotta love it
