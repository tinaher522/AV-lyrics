<song artist="50_Cent" title="Get_Up">
Man I'm gonna do my thing,
it's crazy in the club when I'm in there, man
trust me homie, I'm not playin'
the dance floor of the chain I say (Get Up!)
I came to bring you that California Love
in the middle of New York,
haters all of the above.
I'm not playin' I said I'm off the chain
you niggers better follow instructions, I say (Get up!)
I ball 'till I fall
I stunt 'till I drop
I'm off the showroom floor,
not the used car lot.
You buy a bottle,
I but the bar.
I make any other week feel like Mardi Gras.
When I get into, I get into it
Everybody can't do it the way I do it
I make it rain, then the sun comes out.
A nigger playin' then the guns come out, now
My question is who they goin' to blame
when I' back number one on that billboard again.
Shit chip now The Game don't change.
Since Mike made Triller and Prince made Purple Rain.
I guess I make they kids want slangin,
then N.W.A. made the West Coast bangin'
Nah, It's just music
Man it's just music
Now get your ass on the dance floor and move it
I have the savoir-faire
I'm the reason everybody here I say (Get Up!)
I make it hot I make it hot in here
your feet hurting I really don't care
I say (Get up!)
I wanna see, I wanna see you move
and get on a little groove
I said (Get up!)
I'm getting money man I really don't care
now lemme see you put your hands in the air I say (Get Up!)
You look good, I want to get to know you better
you look good in them jeans and them red stilletos
You got a Bentley Coup booty baby I wanna drive
See I tell you what your mileage is just when I'm inside
I wanna take you for a spin, you know round and round
switch gears until your love come down
I take you to the point of no return,
if you listen you learn,
just how a nigger earn
I got money to burn.
While The Game ban bitched
she dropped the bomb on me
she suck it down and up and down, gracefully
Rick James would have said she a brick house
But 50 you should go ahead and see what that bitch bout'. 
I found out she like hard I like it huh
back it up and get you some
I know how to get you sprung
tune you up
pierce your tongue
under the hood it's so good
she said so good god damn I'm so good
Nigga what up?
I have the savoir-faire
I'm the reason everybody here I say (Get Up!)
I make it hot I make it hot in here
your feet hurting I really don't care
I say (Get up!)
I wanna see, I wanna see you move
and get on a little groove
I said (Get up!)
I'm getting money man I really don't care
now lemme see you put your hands in the air I say (Get Up!)
and get into it
you now rock the building you know that
I said (Get Up!)
and get into it
Imma show you just how we do it
I said (Get Up!)
Aftermath, still Shady aftermath
I said (Get Up!)
aftermath, still Shady aftermath
