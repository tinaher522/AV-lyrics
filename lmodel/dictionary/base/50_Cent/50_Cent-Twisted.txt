<song artist="50_Cent" title="Twisted">
Here’s a little info you should know
You don't know what you're in for
Get the party rockin’, bottles poppin’
Tonight we gon’ turn up ‘till we twisted, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
System thumpin’, the club is jumpin’
Tonight we gon’ turn up ‘till we twisted, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Let’s toast to success and take it a little higher
May tomorrow bring you everything your heart desires
Let your driving ambition offer you new visions
May your gut-instinct help you make good decisions
This is more than Champagne, this is more than just a glass
This is a symbol of accomplishment we rarely ever had
Let’s enjoy tonight like tonight’s our last
We can focus on the future and reflect on the past
We done came so far, I mean, look where we are
If they don’t call us by name they call us entrepreneurs
From the block to the board room, the hood to the high life
Skyscraper paper, baby, life in the limelight
Want the best of the best, the top of the top
I mean the baddest bitch, you know, the cream of the crop
We gotta hustle and have it, we better than average
More like the elite, my nigga, we gotta eat
Get the party rockin’, bottles poppin’
Tonight we gon’ turn up ‘till we twisted, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
System thumpin’, the club is jumpin’
Tonight we gon’ turn up ‘till we twisted, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
What was once a strike against us has become an advantage
Cause we grind when we at it like we stone-cold addicts
That mastermind, the mental is oh so essential
Product of the environment, they ain't been what we've been through
I’m fond of the phrase “If there’s a will, there’s a way”
‘Cause we come from the parts where only killas could play
Southside, it’s alright, ghetto’s my Alma Mater huh? It’s alright
We could keep the party jumpin’ like this all night
The bottles, just keep ‘em coming, baby, let’s get right
Let’s get it on, play a little Marvin
It’s gettin’ hot in here, homie, this could be a problem
Keni Burke style, let’s keep rising to the top
Let’s do it, do it big and let the fuckin’ haters watch, oh yeah
This is perfect, this a moment to remember
As we proceed on our money getting agenda
Get the party rockin’, bottles poppin’
Tonight we gon’ turn up ‘till we twisted, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
System thumpin’, the club is jumpin’
Tonight we gon’ turn up ‘till we twisted, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
