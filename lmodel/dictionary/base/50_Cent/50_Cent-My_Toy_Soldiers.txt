<song artist="50_Cent" title="My_Toy_Soldiers">
You Ready? Ok let me wind you up
Do it exactly the way I said do it man
These Niggas is pussy you heard me?
Get up nice and close
Ya!!
(Chours)
I put that battery in his back
Im the reason why he moves like that
Thats my muthafucking toy soldier
I tell him pop that gat
He gonna pop that gat
You dont want to play with my toy soldier
I say its on then its on until your life is over
F**king with my toy soldier
If hes a casualty of war
Trust me I got more
You dont want it with my Toy Soldier
(Verse1 - 50 Cent)
Now listen up close and follow instructions
Catch a nigga slippin run up on them buck 'em
I aint got no conscience, no morals or nothing
They aint with us they against us we suppost to touch them
Heres what to do if you see them approach me
Pop that nigga I dont care if he know me
Half the niggas hating on me use to be homies
I don't trust them when they smile or playing 'cause they phoney
Everytime I come around they call the police on me
Thats why the d's and the prisents know me
They know about my rap shit, they know how I'll clap you
Run like im in a track meet, swift with the mac B
Can see the envy in there eyes for sure man(mann)
Mad as a muthaf**ka that im holdin(holdinnn)
See me in the back of the phantom(rollinnn)
Quick to make examples out of niggas for sure man(mann)
Hold me down...
(Chours)
I put that battery in his back
Im the reason why he moves like that
Thats my muthaf**king toy soldier
I tell him pop that gat
He gonna pop that gat
You dont want to play with my toy soldier
I say its on then its on until your life is over
F**king with my toy soldier
If hes a casualty of war
Trust me I got more
You dont want it with my Toy Soldier
(Verse2 - 50 Cent)
Shoot, stab, kill muthaf**ka
You aint bout it, I dont want you around cocksucka
Every word out my mouth is felt
That Uz I pop, dem hollows so hot your ass will melt
Barber razor in the club, stunt, ill give ya a shape up
Have your ass stitch, gauged, your head all taped up
Niggas know how I get down
See they know when im around (ha ha)
My soldiers around
And if some shit goes down
And a nigga get laid down
Its no suprise cause niggas know how we get down
Black tints on the tested Rosta
Hammer out the hosta
Gat in my lap incase you gotta get clapped
You monkey niggas went to my hood
We on that guerilla shit
You clap off and miss

We come back and start killing shit
Catch us on the corner wearing black chinchilla shit
We organized, disciplined plus we militant
(Chours)
I put that battery in his back
Im the reason why he moves like that
Thats my muthaf**king toy soldier
I tell him pop that gat
He gonna pop that gat
You dont want to play with my toy soldier
I say its on then its on until your life is over
F**king with my toy soldier
If hes a casualty of war
Trust me I got more
You dont want it with my Toy Soldier
(Bridge - Yayo Screwed &amp; Chopped)
Through the window
Into a mans soul
...
Fill you with holes
Listen homes.... im the man for the job
...we aint playing
(50 Cent )Â : Yayo!
(Tony Yayo) - Come on!
(Verse3 - Tony Yayo)
Im in the coupe or phantom and the body kitted
Waves in my hair looking like Tsunami hit it
Niggas scheme.. the infared beam on the mac
I put green on your head like a Oakland A's Hat
My boy was a douljah, now hes a soldier
My little son Dula, Lettin off the Ruger
In the whip mashed up looking for his enemies
Riding and gased up off double d batteries
Tonights casualties is hooked to them Iv's
(50 Give me the word)
Thats when I Squeeze (Ya!)
Clik Clack take that
Fall Back
Its a contract 50 grand
Im 50's Man
(Chours)
I put that battery in his back
Im the reason he moves like that
Thats my muthaf**king toy soldier
I tell him pop that gat
He gonna pop that gat
You dont want to play with my toy soldier
I say its on then its on until your life is over
F**king with my toy soldier
If hes a casualty of war
Trust me I got more
You dont want it with my Toy Soldier
(Talking)
Ya!
This is the general speaking (yaaa..)
When I say move(ha.ha.hahahaa)
Nigga you better move (wooooh!)

I dont want nobody talking to none of my niggas
Come around with here with that bullshit
Trying to feed niggas bad infomation and shit..
Thats how my toys malfunction
