Man i run this rap shit 
Get your hands up high, hands up high, hands up high
Rest in piece to Biggie Smalls
Get your hands up high, hands up high, hands up high

Get your hands up high, hands up high, hands up high
(VERSE 1: 50 CENT)
U wanna dance lets dance nigga ill take u to da prom

So when im right im right 
And when im wrong im right

Get your hands up high, hands up high, hands up high
(VERSE 2: TONY YAYO)
Hey yo im higher than a pilot man
Ill cut your body man
Beat the case i lied on a polygram
These ogs talk about back in the days
I have an r.i.p. sign on your myspace page
Im your top eight nigga 
Drop eight nigga
GCT coupe its sour grape nigga
Im an ape nigga a gorilla in the mist
I hold weight nigga my connect gots bricks
I wear gold you wear platinum we still got the same cars
Same house and still f**k the same broads
Dreams of f**king an r&amp;b bitch 
Yeah you look good girl but get your teeth fixed
Im the teflon don boy i get busy
Ur legs to strong doing sex with pretty ricky
760 drive by light tint
With two hoes in the whip looking like flip
(CHORUS:)
Man i run this rap shit 
Get your hands up high, hands up high, hands up high
Rest in piece to Biggie Smalls
Get your hands up high, hands up high, hands up high
R.I.P. to Tupac
Get your hands up high, hands up high, hands up high
Nigga roll that good shit
Get your hands up high, hands up high, hands up high
