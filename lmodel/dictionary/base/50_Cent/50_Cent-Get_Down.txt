(feat. Tony Yayo, Hot Rod)
[Intro:]

[Chorus:]
When Its On You Better, Get Get G-Get Get Down!
Get Get G-Get Get Down!

I Let Off You Better, Get Down!
Get Get G-Get Get Down! Get Get G-Get Get Down!
When Its On You Better, Get Down!
I Pull Out You Better, Get Down!
[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
It Might Take Seven Days And Six Nights Before I Get Right
I Get Comfy And I Lean On Them Put That Beam On Them
You Probably Heard Mase Try To Join The Team
Cause Puff Was To Busy Sellin Pimple Cream
The Perfume Is Next With Maybelline
Or Dance Next To Joc To Try And Get Hot
This Is The Quiet Before The Storm, The Warning Before Its On
50 Back On That Shit, 50 Finna To Flip
[Verse 2: Tony Yayo]
They Dont Do It Like This Concentrate On The Wrists
I Got See-Through Rocks On The Kroto-Swiss
I Got Rich Real Quick Now Im Sippin On Cris
Its T - O - N - Y, G-Unit Is The Clique
When Im About To Click (Gun Cock) Thats The Hammer On The Pound
So Ya Better Get Get G-Get Down!
On The Greyhound And Now Im On The Run
Cause I Aint Goin Down For No Damn Murder One!
[Chorus]
[Verse 3: Hot Rod]
When I Roll Through The Hood Man Its All Good
These Hoes Get Down When I Show Em My Wood
Niggas Get Down Cause They Knowin They Should
When Them Things Spit Rounds They Flow Through The Hood
If You's A Hard Nigga You Feelin You Gotta Proof It
I Run With The Unit, Please Man Dont Do It
Act Tough Now You Have To Duck Down
You Hit The Lotto Last Week You Out Of Luck Now Nigga!
[Verse 4: 50 Cent]
I Kiss Money, Money I Got
The Strawberry Daquiri The Same Colour The Drop
You Can See A Nigga Clear When I Put Down The Top
Sunlight Hit The Watch You See The Shit Down The Block
Any Bright Colour Vs, My Shit Right
My Shits Is Diamonds, Yours Bouts And Knights -???
I Know Your Plan Was To Fake It Till You Make It
But Ima Blow Your Ass Up And Thats All The Shit
[Chorus]
