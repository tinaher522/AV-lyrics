<song artist="50_Cent" title="Gatman_And_Robbin">
Gee wilikers Gatman they got me surrounded
[50 Cent]
I'm on my way
[Chorus - 50 Cent]
I got a gatman
There's a problem I'm a solve it
A nigga movin' around
With a big ass revolver and i'm back, man
What the fuck are you retarded
You touch Shady I'll leave you dearly departed
[Verse 1- 50 Cent]
Robin, Cagney or Lacey, it's 50 cent and Shady
The worst baby, put your hands on my peoples
I'll react crazy, put a hole thru ya front and ya back maybe
But dude if you try me, I'll have your ass hooked up to an IV
I'll leave no witnesses when I ride, B
You fuck with me, you see
I react like an animal,and tear you apart
If the masterpiece was murder, I'd major in art.
Niggas knew I wasn't wrapped too tight from start
But bein' a little off, landed me on top of the charts (whoo)
So you take the good with the bad, I guess
Level three Teflon plate on my chest
And my cock back hollow tip in the chamber
Will daint ya, anger will change ya
And make ya aim there and squeeze
[Chorus 50 Cent]
I got a gat man
There's a problem I'm a solve it
A nigga movin' around
With a big ass revolver and i'm back, man [x2]
[Verse 2 - 50 Cent]
Nigga you get it twisted, you can get ya wig splitted
I don't give a fuck, I don't care if police know I did it
Man I hustle, I get money, in the sunshine or a blizzard
I go hard for that paper, homie I just gotta get it
Got a money scheme I'm plottin in the county and I'm with it
You cross me and you gon' make a cemetary visit
That's gangsta, you know me I told it, cuz I live it
Shellcases drop, when that chopper chop
Way up the block, get hit with copper tops
When drama pop, the llama pop
And it won't stop, you can run, call the cops
this aint new, niggas know how I be on it
That shit you got, put my pistol to you I want it
Its not a game, perfect aim, you feel the flame
Up against ya brain, man its so hot I'll make ya wish it rained
[Chorus - 50 Cent]
I got a gat man
There's a problem I'm a solve it
A nigga movin' around
With a big ass revolver and i'm back, man
What the fuck are you retarded
You touch Shady I'll leave you dearly departed.
