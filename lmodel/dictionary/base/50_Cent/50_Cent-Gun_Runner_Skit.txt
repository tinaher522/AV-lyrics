[Phone ringing]
[Fifty]
Aww man...who the fuck is callin'?..
I don't even wanna answer this shit...Hello?
[Man on phone]
Whattup nigga it's Black
Remember me from way back?
We used to go to school together
man, I got your number from Heather
she said you sell guns, I got beef I wanna see what you got
and if I like it I'll cop
[Fifty]
Damm nigga, you hot
You talkin' like you tryin' to get a nigga knocked
what time is it? man, it's fuckin' 4 O'clock
I shouldn't sell you shit, but Son, meet me on the block
I ain't got time to waste man, where this nigga at?
I'm in the Brown hooptie, there he go, I see 'em
pullin' up slow in the BM
I popped my trunk to show him what I'm workin' wit',
first I showed him the Teck
I told him Niggas give these shits respect
but you don't want this, Man
These shits is known to jam
This is a little smaller here,
and a little more common, 9 Millimeter Ruger
16 shots, hollow points will go through ya
and this? this here? this is a 12 gauge Mossburg kid,
Two shots and you can wet like half a block
This shit here gets my dick hard,
it's a Calicko, it holds a Hundred shots
If you can't kill your beef with this you need to stop
C'mon, pick somethin' now nigga, you know it's hot
[Other Man]
Man, stop actin' like that nigga, just show me what you got
[Fifty]
aight, nigga look, I got Two 380's,
One black, one chrome, and 4 glocks
They all hold 21 shots
look, I done been through all my shit nigga,
So tell me what you want
[Other Man]
(Click clack)
It's hard to choose man, I think I'll take 'em all
[Fifty]
Oh, you gon' do me like that?
I got one more piece to show you, my Deringer,
I keep it in the small of my back
It's a two shot, it's chrome, my initials engraved in it
[shots ring off]
Look at you now, you had to get it
your BM? I'm takin' it, shit, you don't need it
park it where I can watch it at and see if it got low jack
then take it to the chop shop to my Man Kojak
he gon' give me more cream so I can cop mo' gats
Joe and Duke came through, them niggas copped two Tecks
said "Don't go by the gamblin' spot, that shit gon' get wet".
