<song artist="50_Cent" title="Strong_Enough">
You ain't strong enough nigga
 You probably go against me and win
 But you, you don't stand a chance nigga
 I do more than talk that, I motherfuckin' walk that
 Blue Yankee cap back, fuck around get clapped at
 I sleep with the stainless, I walk with the stainless
 Man, everybody know about 50, I'm famous
 New York, New York, I run New York
 Ask Dread at the weed spot, I come through in the mean drop
 In different boroughs I have different moments
 On different days niggas know how I'm on it
 I'm pretty like a Harlem nigga
 I'm a shooter like a Brooklyn nigga
 I'm a hustler don't get no bigger
 Queens, South Side 'til they bury me
 BX two tek's, flames out the nozzles
 R1 one wheel, Christian Dior goggles
 Spar with me start some shit send the shooters out
 Come out the club we out front with the Rugers out
 Nah, ain't no sense to talkin' peace my brother
 That beef will probably send your monkey ass to see Allah
 These niggas ain't strong enough, their money ain't long enough
 When they bump heads with me they find out the guns do bust
 We getting' paper in God we trust
 These sucker ass niggas
 These niggas ain't strong enough, their money ain't long enough
 When they bump heads with me they find out the guns do bust
 We getting' paper in God we trust
 Suck on this nigga
 When I said I'll kill ya, I'll kill ya
 As a kid I wasn't kiddin' then
 Special ed kid in the back on Ritalin
 Crib all fucked up, hooptie all fucked up
 Pockets all fucked up, now nigga wassup?
 I'm rich now, niggas know about my dividends
 Look at the Raw Report, check out what I'm livin' in
 Fuck a spot now, I'm 'bout to buy a yacht now
 Crib the size of the New York City clock now
 Okay, okay, try me and get shot down
 I'm like a zebra, I got so many stripes
 I'm the fuckin' general, I run my clique right
 It was five of us, all of us millionaires
 Now one's a fuckin' junkie and one's a fuckin' queer
 Now it's three of us, that's the way we started
 They call me crazy, cold blooded and black hearted
 I don't play no games, niggas beg for mercy
 Then we T-O-S, put that ass to rest
 These niggas ain't strong enough, their money ain't long enough
 When they bump heads with me they find out the guns do bust
 We gettin' paper in God we trust
 These sucker ass niggas
 These niggas ain't strong enough, their money ain't long enough
 When they bump heads with me they find out the guns do bust
 We gettin' paper in God we trust
 Suck on this nigga
