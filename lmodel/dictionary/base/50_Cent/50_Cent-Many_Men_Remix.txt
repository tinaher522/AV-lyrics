<song artist="50_Cent" title="Many_Men_Remix">
(feat. 2pac)
Man we gotta go get something to eat man
I'm hungry as a motherfucker
Ay yo man, damn what's taking homie so long son?
50, calm down, here he come
Ahh, ohh, what the fuck!?
Ahh! son, pull up! pull up!
Many men, wish death upon me
Blood in my eye dawg and I can't see
I'm trying to be what I'm destined to be
And niggas trying to take my life away
I put a hole in a nigga for fucking with me
My back on the wall, now you gon' see
Better watch how you talk, when you talk about me
'Cause I'll come and take your life away
Many men, many, many, many, many men
Wish death upon me
Lord I don't cry no more
Don't look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me
Now these pussy niggas putting money on my head
Go on and get your refund motherfucker, I ain't dead
I'm the diamond in the dirt, that ain't been found
I'm the underground king and I ain't been crowned
When I rhyme, something special happen every time
I'm the greatest, something like Ali in his prime
I walk the block with the bundles
I've been knocked on the humble
Swing the ox when I rumble
Show your ass what my gun do
Got a temper nigga, go'head, lose your head
Turn your back on me, get clapped and lose your legs
I walk around gun on my waist, chip on my shoulder
Till I bust a clip in your face, pussy, this beef ain't over
Many men, many, many, many, many men
Wish death upon me
Lord I don't cry no more
Don't look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me
Have mercy on my soul
Somewhere my heart turned cold
Have mercy on many men
Many, many, many, many men
Wish death upon me
Our lifesytles be close caption
Addicted to fatal attraction
Pictures and actions be played back
In the mist of mashin'
No fairytales for this young black male
Some see me stranded in this land of Hell
Jail and crack cells
???? culture
Or the repercussion
While bustin' on back-stabbing vultures
Sellin' my soul
For material wishes
Fast cars and bitches
Wishin' I live my life a legend 
Immortalized in pictures
Why shed tears, save your sympathy
My childhood years
Was spend burying my peers in the cemetary
Here's a message to the newborns
Waiting to breath:
"If you believe
you can achieve, just look at me"
Against all odds
Though life is hard, we carry on 
Living in the projects
Broke with no lights on
To all the G's that follow me
Protect your essence
Born with less but your still precious
Just smile for me now
[Chorus: x2]
Many men, many, many, many, many men
Wish death upon me
Lord I don't cry no more
Don't look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me
Have mercy on my soul
Somewhere my heart turned cold
Have mercy on many men
Many, many, many, many men
Wish death upon me
