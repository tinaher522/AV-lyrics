(50 Cent)
(Uh huh) I know you like my style
(Uh huh) You like how I break it down
(Uh huh) I know you like my style
(Uh huh) You like how I break it down
I know you like my style 
You like how I break it down
Wanna get rich, I'll show you how
Wanna get rich, I'll show you how
On your mark, get set, lets go 
Switch the flow teach ya how to turn Yayo into Dough
The original dan-dadda 
Nobody bum harder 
You heard what I said boy I'm hot I'm hot!
You hoodrats, they say "He is so crazy"
Its not just they say "He tried to spray me"
But thats what you get for tryna play me
The aftermath on my rap is so shady!
No matter how you try you can't stop this
I'll catch you stuntin relently crew cockpit
If you a pimp why your hoes stay out your pocket?
Fine find out how my P-40 glock is
(Tony Yayo)
50 you need some help? 
(50 cent)
Chill Yayo I got this
So where I'm from and the B's tryna knock us
I swear to god that its me sellin the choppa's
Man I ain't givin them lil' niggas no products
(Chorus) 
(Uh huh) I know you like my style
(Uh huh) But how much do you like my style?
(Uh huh) You like how I break it down
(Uh huh) Wanna get rich I'll show you how
(Uh huh) I know you like my style
(Uh huh) But how much do you like my style?
(Uh huh) You like how I break it down
Wanna get rich I'll show you how
(50 Cent)
You birds they say I got a way with words
I'll be like "Babygirl I like them curves"
If your not busy tonight then we can swirve
I'm a batchler baby fuck what you heard!
I'ma tell you in 10 minutes I'll make you a believer
Tony touch will have you shakin like you havin a seizure
I'll makes hits about what I do on my leisure
G-Unit gang can't another click out there see us 
Niggaz lipsynce the lyrics cause they wanna be us 
Groupy hoes from the hood they be tryna G us
Tryna holla at the kid errytime they see us 
Girlfriend quit pretendin I'm the nigga you lovin 
And I ain't got to say nuttin' you know that I'm thuggin
Put my hands on that ass seein you say that I'm buggin 
"We family baby", kissin cousins
Now look with the riff-raff done druggin
For the G's my degrees is hotter than your oven
I'ma New Yorker but I sound southern
And we sip DP till the don stop buggin
After we play OK go to your husband
(Chorus)
(Uh huh) I know you like my style
(Uh huh) But how much do you like my style?
(Uh huh) You like how I break it down
(Uh huh) Wanna get rich I'll show you how
(Uh huh) I know you like my style
(Uh huh) But how much do you like my style?
(Uh huh) You like how I break it down
Wanna get rich I'll show you how
Em said your gon' like my style
Dre said your gon' like my style
I said you gon' like my style
You don't like how I break it down
(Tony Yayo)
You're not, really really, ready ready 
The drama will have ya ass in trama boy
You're not, really really, ready ready 
My knife flip open and then I gets to poken 
You're not, really really, ready ready 
Them shows start poppin them bodies start to drop in
You're not, really really, ready ready 
(50 Cent)
You think your ready? You're not....
Really really, ready ready
