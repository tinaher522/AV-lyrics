Verse 1:
That shit is old, dont be screamin Get At me Dog,
Have you runnin for ya life when i match ya boy,
I get to wavin that semi like its legal,
a lil nigga hurt his arm lettin off that eagle,

ill clap yo monkey ass,yea black on black crime.
Big ol' chrome rims gleam, you know why I *Shyne*
C'mon man, you know how I Shyne.
Im in the hood, in the drop, teflon vinyl top
got a 100 guns a 100 clips, why I dont hear no shots?
that fat nigga thought "Lean Back" was "in the club",
My shit sold 11 mill, his shit was a dud.
Jada don't fuck wit me if u wanna eat,
cause I'll do ya little ass like Jay did Mobb Deep.
Yea homie in New York, niggas like ya vocals,
but thats only in New York dog, yo ass is local.
[Chorus]
[Bridge]

Verse 2:
Banks' shit sells, Buck's shit sells, Game shit sells,
Im rich as hell.
Shyne poppin off his mouth from a cell,
he dont want it wit me, he in PC.
I could have a nigga run up on him with a shank,
for just a few pennies out my piggy bank.
Yayo, bring the condoms, im in room 203
freak bitch look like kim, before the surgery
its an emergency, on Michael Jackson, see
you'll pitch her and say she looks like me,
Kelis say her milkshake bring all the boys to the yard
then Nas went and tattooed the bitch on his arm.
Im way out in Cali, niggas know you cuz,
First thing they say about u, you's a sucka for love
This is chess, not checkers, these are warning shots,
After ya next move, I'll give ya what I got. (YEEAH)
