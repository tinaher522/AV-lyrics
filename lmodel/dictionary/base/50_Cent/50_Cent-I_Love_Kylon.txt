BoYIt's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
boy...It's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
boy...
Never leave me hangin around by myself again...
you make me feel like a lil ol kid
all i do is cry cry cry
i want to be wih you and all you say i
lie oh lie
Boy...It's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
Boy...It's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
Boy...
