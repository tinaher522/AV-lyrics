[sound of a car trunk opening]
[1:] Here you go man...
[2:] Jesus Christ man you going to war.
[1:] What I say? Didn't I say come to me? Do I ever disappoint? Fuckin' no. Why? I deliver.
Why? I'm your man. How do I know? How? Know? Know how. I got
100 things to do this morning and you're first in line so could we move it along please?
[2:] Okay. Fine. Right. I'm just lookin' for something. Small. Light. Cheap. 3-80, 3-80. Somethin' like that.
[1:] No, no, no. You want to be packin' like a man Eddy, you're a man, man.
How 'bout this umâ€¦6-inch 3-5-7 magnum.
[2:] Yeah.
[1:] Or the Mantic's Browning 9-mill. Now I know what you're thinking, that's got no stopping power.
But that's got 13 shots in the clip man. That won't
Just kill a man, that'll turn him inside out, pull him upside down, piss on him, read him last...
[2: (interrupting)] Fine, fine. Yeah I get the message, I'm just.. I'm just a bit fuckin' lost there.
And these are totally untraceable?
[1:] They don't exist 
[2:] What about guarantee's
[1:] What do you think this is? Guns-Are-Us?
