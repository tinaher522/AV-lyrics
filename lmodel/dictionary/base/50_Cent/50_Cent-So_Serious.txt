<song artist="50_Cent" title="So_Serious">
I'm so so serious
(Oh)
(Serious mannn)
(Oh, so serious)
(Ohh)
I-I got it
I-I get it
Now i lay
Thee down to sleep
I pray my Lord
My soul to keep
If i should die
Though before i wake
Let my niggas celebrate
And split my cake
It's 50
I'm so real
You ain't seen
Nothin' realer
Ice crack dealer
I click clack
For the scrilla
I'm heartless
Ssomething like
A cold blooded killer
I'm filthy, dirty
With the money my nigga
I done ran
Through more cars
Then your
Rolls Rroyce dealer
I put that
On my god-daughter
I love you Jarmilla
New Bentley or not
Match the chincilla
Sean don spiller
Matching 4-wheeler
I'm big in New York
I move like godzilla
Go-rilla
You are not deep nigga
Grave-digger
Ask Puffy and Jigga
Made nigga
My pockets
Get bigger and bigger
You got no choice
But to feel a nigga
When i spit that shit
I figure
It will only
Bring mo' bread
You fuck around
I get down
And go upside yo' head
Now i lay thee
Down to sleep
I pray my Lord
My soul to keep
If i should die
Though before i wake
Let my niggas celebrate
And split my cake
Now i lay
Thee down to sleep
I pray the Lord
Fforgive me
For holding heat
If i should die
Though before i wake
Let my niggas celebrate
And split my cake
50 Speaking
Ohhh
I just got back
From the UK
A little jet-lagged
Ffrom the flight
But when
I'm out there
They say
50, 50
Your my favourite
We love you 50
Your massive
Mash it tup
There is not
Competetion
No, no
There's no
Competetion
You have
To be kidding
I'm can't
Believe it i'mÂ ?
It's 50, yeahhh
