<song artist="50_Cent" title="Stretch">
I take grams of coke, mix it with lactose
 That's what I do, stretch
 I make a ounce of dope with like a eighth of dope
 Befo' I'm through, product stretch
 I got it mastered man
 In the hood I'm like plastic man, stretch
 Fantastic man
 I make the money come faster man, yeah
 Your favorite bad guy's gone, the Joker's dead
 So from now until forever you're stuck with the kid
 I ain't supposed to be a boss, I'm supposed to be an enforcer
 I'm supposed to hold a gun, not be stuck in the office
 Michael pimped me? I was in the passenger seat
 He was comfortable with me 'round 'cause I blast my heat
 '9-4 I was tryin' to catch Mason for bricks of raw
 Charlie fucked up the jux, they took Nana's little boy, stretch
 The cocaine, I go hard when the drought come
 When the straps come out son niggaz know the outcome
 Lay low, stay low, you may see Jesus
 Get hit with a stray yo for no fuckin' reason
 You prayin' for a Benz, it's a blessin' you breathin'
 It's a miracle that God gave me this Tec, now I'm eatin'
 Cop it, chop it, profit is all for sale
 Cocaine, 'Candy Rain', 'I'm Soul For Real', yeah
 I take grams of coke, mix it with lactose
 That's what I do, stretch
 I make a ounce of dope with like a eighth of dope
 Befo' I'm through, product stretch
 I got it mastered man
 In the hood I'm like plastic man, stretch
 Fantastic man
 I make the money come faster man, yeah
 I'm the dope man, coke man, smoke man, whatever man
 The X man, Tec man, you better respect man
 Get the cream, triple beam, inf' beam, murder scheme
 Fiend, morphine, dream, codeine, mo' lean
 Gun pop, one shot, body drop, it wasn't me
 Tell the cops it wasn't me, you saw me right? It wasn't me
 It's not my M.O., see me I make it stretch
 Get in the way I'll put a body on my Tec
 Call me crazy, I'll die for what I stand for
 I'll have ammo flyin' out the Lambo
 Like 'Commando', nah, like 'Rambo'
 I keep my cool as long as the fuckin' grams go
 Woopty-woo, I'm a Chef like Rae
 It's hot in here, I'm by the stove cookin' crack all day
 Stretch, we gon' bag up all night
 We ain't goin' nowhere 'til the count back right, yeah
 I take grams of coke, mix it with lactose
 That's what I do, stretch
 I make a ounce of dope with like a eighth of dope
 Befo' I'm through, product stretch
 I got it mastered man
 In the hood I'm like plastic man, stretch
 Fantastic man
 I make the money come faster man, yeah
 It's a bird, it's a plane, no, it's pure cocaine
 Tryna blow sellin' blow I'm who you fuck with mayne
 I got Spider-Man high, I made Batman fly
 Your favorite hero took a hit, now here you try
 I don't care if it's a sin, I don't care if you're ten
 Look around kid, it's a cold world we're in
 If you ask me my offer is extremely handsome
 A little Charlie, Marley, a little bit of Manson
 Yeah, me fallin' off is really far fetched
 I turn a little to a lot, I make it stretch
 In come the Franklin's, then come the Benji's
 Fiends by the crack house, dirty and dingy, yeah
 I take grams of coke, mix it with lactose
 That's what I do, stretch
 I make a ounce of dope with like a eighth of dope
 Befo' I'm through, product stretch
 I got it mastered man
 In the hood I'm like plastic man, stretch
 Fantastic man
 I make the money come faster man, yeah
