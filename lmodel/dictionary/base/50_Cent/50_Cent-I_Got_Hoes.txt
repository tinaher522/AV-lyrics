<song artist="50_Cent" title="I_Got_Hoes">
Nigga, nigga, I got hoes, niggas
I got hoes
I'm the one to commit to a girl
Fuck with a pimp, come on, travel the world
I got hoes
There's so many places to see
And things to do when you're fuckin' with me
I got hoes
Every kinda bitch you like
Comin' into the crib, we gon' party tonight
I got hoes
I got big ones, tall ones, small ones
I got thick ones, thin ones, call one
Tell her come on over, spoil her and break bread
She can have blond hair, blue eyes, vanilla thighs, I'm with it
Overseas, Japanese, race to please, I get it
Yeah, up in the Israel, the pussy is real
A bitch strap a bomb to the pussy and kill
I have freak bitches in Greece, Greek bitches in Nice
You can hear me from the next room, 50 a piece
Call me Long John Silver, I breast stroke, back stroke
Pro swimmer, find out after dinner
Had a mixed bitch, half black, half Hawaiian
Half the time she told the truth, the other half she was lyin'
Yeah, I fucked models in London, they sold the story
I was gonna tell everybody, they just told you for me
Please believe me, I'ma 'P.I.M.P.'
My dick shakin' and breakin' a bitch look easy
It's the G man, I mean the flow so hot
It make Asian bitches in Bangkok wanna bang cock
I got hoes
I'm the one to commit to a girl
Fuck with a pimp, come on, travel the world
I got hoes
There's so many places to see
And things to do when you're fuckin' with me
I got hoes
Every kinda bitch you like
Comin' into the crib, we gon' party tonight
I got hoes
I got big ones, tall ones, small ones
I got thick ones, thin ones, call one
Tell her come on over, spoil her and break bread
The jewels cost 500 grand
Turn the Murcielago engine off, man, silence to the Lamb'
Whip the Ferrar' so hard, Jake gave my ass a domestic charge
Nah nigga, I ain't no Popeye nigga, drama or no baby momma, nigga
Got a G on the necklace, move sumthin' out the jeans
Bitch better peck this or get the steppin'
I got bills, bitch do somethin'
Don't waste my time like quarterback Mills
Just chill, wrist on your forehead
Ride four niggas, bitch, give all four head
Yeah, hoe, you know I'ma pimp
7 tray Capris, ride with a limp
Nuthin' worse than a broke nigga who's a simp'
Fif call 'em monkeys, I call 'em chimps
Hold up, man, I dropped my dollars
Bitch pick it up and my pop my collar
I got hoes
I'm the one to commit to a girl
Fuck with a pimp, come on, travel the world
I got hoes
There's so many places to see
And things to do when you're fuckin' with me
I got hoes
Every kinda bitch you like
Comin' into the crib, we gon' party tonight
I got hoes
I got big ones, tall ones, small ones
I got thick ones, thin ones, call one
Tell her come on over, spoil her and break bread
I got hoes
Nigga, I got hoes and that there is fa' sho fa' sho
I got hoes
Banks, tell 'em I got hoes, Yayo, tell 'em I got hoes
I got hoes
Buck, tell 'em I got hoes, Hot Rod, tell 'em I got hoes
I got hoes
Nigga, I got hoes, I ain't bullshittin', I got hoes
Spider know I got hoes, M.O.P. know I got hoes
Mobb Deep know I got hoes, Eminem know I got hoes
Dr. Dre know I got hoes, Lord knows I got hoes
