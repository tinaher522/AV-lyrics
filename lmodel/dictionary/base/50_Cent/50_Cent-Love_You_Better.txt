But you never thought you'd meet a girl quite like me (like me)
I like the ball
I'll take you out
Buy out the mall
You never thought you'd meet a girl quite like me
I own them all
The cribs and cars
I'm a superstar
Anything you want
Boy you know I got it
Put you on a plane
Go somewhere exotic
Take you all around the world
Fulfill your fantasies
I can make you love
I'll be everything you need
That's your girlfriend, yeah whatever
I know I can love you better
She's not special
I just met her
I know I can love you better
Ohhh
You don't look too happy at all
You need me in your life you should call
I'll save you
Baby you should let me be here for you

You're the boy that I'd been pursuing
I want you bad
I'll be the girl
You never had
Pardon me if I seem too aggressive (I'm sorry)
I know you want me too
I'll make you love me
I'll spoil you too
Anything you want
Boy you know I got it
Put you on a plane
Go somewhere exotic
Take you all around the world
Fulfill your fantasies
I can make you love me
I'll be everything you need
That's your girlfriend, yeah whatever
I know I can love you better
She's not special
I just met her
I know I can love you better
Ooh
You don't look too happy at all
You need me in your life you should call
I'll save you
Baby, baby you should let me be here for you
