*featuring Linkin Park
 [50 Cent:]
 Sh-sh-sh-shady
 Aftermath, haha
 G-G-G-G-G-Unit!, haha
 [Jay-Z &amp; Linkin Park:]
 I've become so numb
 Can I get an encore,
 Do you want more (more...) [x3]
 [Eminem:]
 Get your ass up for the doctor
 One more time, get your ass up for the doctor
 Come on now, here we go
 Cliff hanger, it's another club banger
 Got you hangin' on the edge of your seat
 Get on down
 [Dr. Dre:]
 Times up, games over, you lose, I win
 'bout to show these knuckleheads how to do this here
 Ooh yeah, new year, next phase, begin
 Look who's got you goin' crazy again
 I'm a trend, I set one every time I'm in
 I go out and just come back full circle again
 You a fad, that means your something that we already had
 But once you're gone, you don't come back, too bad
 [Eminem:]
 You're off the map now, radar can't even find you
 We stay on the grind, you slip, we out-grind you
 You walk around mad, you let your anger blind you
 We walk around just playin' the violin behind you
 Enough with all the pissin' and moanin', whinin' and bitchin'
 Sit and observe, listen, you'll learn if you pay attention
 Why ten multi-platinum albums later, three diamond
 World-wide, we're on the charts with a bullet and still climbin'
 [Chorus: Jay-Z &amp; Linkin Park]
 Now can I get an encore, do you want more
 Cookin raw with the Brooklyn boy
 So for one last time I need y'all to roar
 Now what the hell are you waitin for
 After me, there shall be no more
 So for one last time, nigga make some noise
 [Brigde: Eminem]
 So all my people on the left, all my people on the right
 Scream one last time
 [Eminem:]
 When dr. dre say crunk, you will get it crunk, get it crunk
 Crunk, crunk, crunk
 And when 50 cent says jump, you get on one foot and jump
 Jump, jump, jump, jump
 [Dr. Dre:]
 The buzz is tremendous, we drop you all to sense it
 I don't gotta promote it for you to know that doc is off the benches
 [Eminem:]
 We keep the party rockin' off the henges
 We ain't showin' off, we just goin' off popular consensus
 [Dr. Dre:]
 But critics say that Doc is soft, Doc is talk
 Doc is all washed up, knock it off
 Who the fuck is Doc impressin'?
 Doc is this, Doc is that, you got the wrong impression
 You must be on the cock of Doc, cause Doc left you all guessin'
 So DJ take the needle and just drop it on the record (what)
 We gon' have this mutherfucker hoppin' in a second (bump bump)
 That's why we always save the best cut last
 To make you scratch and itch for it like fresh cut grass
 [Eminem:]
 Cause we done swam with the sharks, wrestle with alligators
 Spoke to a generation of angry teenagers
 Whom if it wasn't for rap to bridge the gap
 Maybe raised to be racist
 Who may have never got to see our faces
 Grace the cover of Rolling Stone pages
 Broke down barriers of language and races
 Just call on the cape crusaders
 And leave it to me and Dre to pass the mic
 And we can play the back and forth all day
 Like the hot potato game, that's why we came to
 [Bridge: Eminem]
 First we came here to set this party off right
 Let's bounce tonight
 [Chorus:]
 Now what the hell are you waitin for
 After me, there shall be no more
 So for one last time, nigga make some noise
 I've become so numb
 So for one last time I need y'all to roar
 One last time I need y'all to roar
 [Linkin Park:]
 Every step that I take is another mistake to you
 (Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow)
 And every second I waste is more than I can take
 [Chorus: Linkin Park &amp; Jay-Z]
 I've become so numb I can't feel you there
 I've become so tired so much more aware
 I'm becoming this all I want to do
 Is be more like me and be less like you
 I've become so numb
 Can I get an encore, do you want more (more...)
 [50 Cent:]
 Bounce now, hands up, you know how we do
 We make the club jump everywhere we go
 It's no secret, everybody know
 When Dre's involved, there's plenty money involved
 [Dr. Dre:]
 And plenty honey's involved, the sunny Sunday's and palm trees
 Cali, everyday it's just another party from the valley's
 All the way to them 8 Mile alleys, let's rally
 [Eminem:]
 Hands up for the grand finale
 Now raise up out your seat, Dre is about to speak
 Blaze a pound of weed six days up out the week
 [Dr. Dre:]
 You could catch me in the studio bangin' out the beats to
 Provide you with the heat that keep blazin' out your speaker
 [Eminem:]
 So never say never cause Shady Aftermath together
 Along with G-Unit Records presents the return of the-the Doc (and Shady)
 No one could do it better
 We tear the club up and leave without a strand of evidence and uh
 [Chorus: Jay-Z &amp; Linkin Park]
 Now can I get an encore, do you want more
 Cookin raw with the Brooklyn boy
 So for one last time I need y'all to roar
 I've become so numb
 So for one last time I need y'all to roar
 One last time I need y'all to roar
