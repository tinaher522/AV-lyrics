<song artist="50_Cent" title="First_Date">
Big boy! 
Just one night, 2 nights, could be 3 of us
Girl we can get it on, girl we can have a ball
Bring your girlfriend, come on
Life's too short to not fuck on the first date
No one knows if we're promised tomorrow
But if we make love into the next day
We'll have the best of our time celebrating
Just one night, 2 nights, could be 3 of us
Girl we can get it on, girl we can have a ball
Bring your girlfriend, come on
Life's too short to not fuck on the first date
No one knows if we're promised tomorrow
But if we make love into the next day
We'll have the best of our time celebrating
4 in the morning now girl I don't wanna talk
We've been talking for hours, now you know I wanna fuck
Look I don't understand what is it you don't understand
My watch 100 grand, my chain 100 grand, 
I'm a wanted man, I say I run new york
Cause I do what the fuck I wanna do, they know what's up
They say my school's a loose, I say who dares, you know I'm rich
Look I don't have time to blow it up... this sh*t
Now maybe you can loosen up and let me go to work
So I can whisper in your ear while pulling down your skirt
When I get this... girl you don't know what to say
We can come... girl I'm gone right away
Yeah, you nasty girl, you nasty
And I'm into that, so get at me
I don't want no good, good, good, good girl
Me, I want a nasty girl, come freak with me
Be a freak for me
Life's too short to not fuck on the first date
No one knows if we're promised tomorrow
But if we make love into the next day
We'll have the best of our time celebrating
I said ew, I wanna fuck you in the worst way
Hell yeah I wanna fuck you on the first day
If I don't, I say fuck you on thursday
Cause then I won't want you, watch how fast I dump you
But right now I'm infatuated, 
You get to hang with me, girl you graduated
I take you out to drinks and get you tipsy
Then I pull my d*ck out and I say kiss me
You bout to laugh your little panties off
You only get one date, you better... 
They wanna ride in fancy cars, that's what babies do
They like to fuck... she's a nasty little tramp
But I like that, so let's fuck
I don't want no good, good, good, good girl
Me, I want a nasty girl, come freak with me
Be a freak for me
Life's too short to not fuck on the first date
No one knows if we're promised tomorrow
But if we make love into the next day
We'll have the best of our time celebrating
