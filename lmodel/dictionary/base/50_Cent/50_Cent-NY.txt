<song artist="50_Cent" title="NY">
(Chorus)
Call me 50 year, call me Ferrari, call me New York
NY is my name change nigga I ain't playing games
New York for sure call me NY
New York for sure call me NY
You won't close my next felony fucking round I get the mack blowing
My heart colder than that corner you get clapped on
The crack on show you about get my jack on
I long no place we packs on
..my mind I just lame back on
Stack on em get yeah rack after rack on em
Get a foam this mess on cutting this mat for em
Pop up in the yulla could dead for em
Nigga getting the way out banging the crap on em
Then lineup the woolves and scream my tack on em
I'm cool tryin keep cool till I snap on em
I'm coming for a nigga head when I black on em
(Chorus x2)
Is 50 year, call me Ferrari, call me New York
NY this my name change nigga I ain't playing games
New York for sure call me NY
New York for sure call me NY
I hate when you niggas do shit then make me ask why
If you the homie why you won't gonna testify
Why you wanna see a nigga get the champ fry
A..in New York standing at the sky
Why you hurt your friends more than your enemies
And why you don't seek the stroke to your memories
Why is the question I ask
Shit was all good when you're splitting up stacks
The shit you told the people gotta undermax
Now why would you wanna do some shit like that
When that barrel on your forehead don't ask why...
Shhh, quiet close your eyes and die!
(Chorus x2)
Is 50 year, call me Ferrari, call me New York
NY this my name change nigga I ain't playing games
New York for sure call me NY
New York for sure call me NY
