<song artist="50_Cent" title="Gangsta's_Delight">
This is hip hop, it go clip pop, it hit 'em if you hit me
 Da clip pop it popped and it don't stop
 Papa said we bang, bang boogie, we get 'em, oh goodie
 Keep the hoodie when you're fuckin' with me, me, me
 Now what you hear is not a test
 I said it's not a test nigga it's not a test
 Got my Teflon on wrapped around my chest
 I do it the best, you heard I do it the best
 Tuck the Nine by my spine all the time
 Stunt when I want a dead nigga fuck wit mine
 My neck and my ear get to flickin' like a strobe
 My wrist and my whips have niggas like whoa
 I'm the underground king, I reside on the throne
 In the club wylin' out over Henny and Patron
 Me I'm in the zone, yeah me, I'm in the zone
 It's bottle after bottle 'til G-stacks are blown
 Shawty in my ear like please take me home
 Before the next song come on dawg we gone
 Off to the hotel, motel, the holiday inn
 She said if I knew you worked the cat from the back like that
 I would've brought my friend
 It go clip pop, it hit 'em if you hit me
 Da clip pop it popped and it don't stop
 Papa said we bang, bang boogie, we get 'em, oh goodie
 Keep the hoodie when you're fuckin' with me, me, me
 Clip pop, it hit 'em if you hit me
 Da clip pop it popped and it don't stop
 Papa said we bang, bang boogie, we get 'em, oh goodie
 Keep the hoodie when you're fuckin' with me, me, me
 I'm so raw yea I'm so raw
 Me I'm so ghetto I'm oh so hardcore
 I'm down by law this style you never saw
 I give em jus a little then watch 'em fiend for more
 Yeah, they want more, they hot and they want more
 They love the way I kick it, they addicted to your boy
 I'm ecstasy I'm the ultimate trip
 I have ya in the mornin' like a dope fiend sick
 Now feel the rush I'm like pure cocaine
 I have the whole night club goin' insane
 No matter how rich I get I'm never gonna change
 I will let it rain, push me I'll let it rain
 I do this shit myself lawyer money ain't a thang
 The Unit is the game, the yin and the yang
 We went from poor to rich now look we the shit
 You best control your bitch or she'll be in the six
 It go clip pop, it hit 'em if you hit me
 Da clip pop it popped and it don't stop
 Papa said we bang, bang boogie, we get 'em, oh goodie
 Keep the hoodie when you're fuckin' with me, me, me
 It go clip pop, it hit 'em if you hit me
 Da clip pop it popped and it don't stop
 Papa said we bang, bang boogie, we get 'em, oh goodie
 Keep the hoodie when you're fuckin' with me, me, me
 I'm fresh to death, I'm rockin' the vest
 I'm strapped movin' round with the heat
 I said I do it the best, I'm not the one you should test
 That's why my name ring bells in the street
 I put that work in, yeah, yeah
 I put that work in, yeah, yeah
 I put that work in, yeah, yeah
 I put that work in, yeah, yeah
 It go clip pop, it hit 'em if you hit me
 Da clip pop it popped and it don't stop
 Papa said we bang, bang boogie, we get 'em, oh goodie
 Keep the hoodie when you're fuckin' with me, me, me
 It go clip pop, it hit 'em if you hit me
 Da clip pop it popped and it don't stop
 Papa said we bang, bang boogie, we get 'em, oh goodie
 Keep the hoodie when you're fuckin' with me, me, me
