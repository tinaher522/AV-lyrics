<song artist="50_Cent" title="LL_Remix">
Yeah, new 50, London, London
When I come up in the club with my nine
I'll be frontin' for the hoes with my shine
Tell the shorty I don't do this all the time
But I'll buy her ass a drink 'cause she fine
You know usually a nigga don't trick
But I really wanna get you in my six
Be a freak for me, shorty, suck the dick
If it's really good, I'll be done quick
Girl, you know every time you come around
Your London, London Bridge is going down
Your London, London, London wanna go down like
I'm comin', comin', comin' in your mouth
Girl, you know every time you come around
Your London, London Bridge is going down
Your London, London, London wanna go down like
I'm comin', comin', comin' in your mouth
Oh shit, the Grey Goose, man, I'm mixin' that with juice
The Red Bull that I did it as a boost
First I was showin', now a nigga is confused
So many bitches up in here I can choose
Now I don't know which one I'ma pick
They ride with me in my Bentley [Incomprehensible]
And when you spit the kinda G I spit
You could leave it to a three and shit
Girl, you know every time you come around
Your London, London Bridge is going down
Your London, London, London wanna go down like
I'm comin', comin', comin' in your mouth
Girl, you know every time you come around
Your London, London Bridge is going down
Your London, London, London wanna go down like
I'm comin', comin', comin' in your mouth
Me like a bullet type, you know they comin' right
Fergie love 'em long time, my girls support right?
Me like a bullet type, you know they comin' right
Fergie love 'em long time, my girls support right?
When I come to the clubs, step aside
Part the seas, don't be havin' me in the line
V.I.P. 'cause you know I gotta shine
I'm Fergie Ferg and me love you long time
All my girls get down on the floor
Back to back, drop it down real low
I'm such a lady but I'm dancin' like a ho
'Cause you know I don't give a fuck, so here we go
Girl, you know every time you come around
Your London, London Bridge is going down
Your London, London, London wanna go down like
I'm comin', comin', comin' in your mouth
Girl, you know every time you come around
Your London, London Bridge is going down
Your London, London, London wanna go down like
I'm comin', comin', comin' in your mouth
