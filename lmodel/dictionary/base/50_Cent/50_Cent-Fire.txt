Fire!!!
[Intro: 50 Cent]
I make it hotter
Friction turns to fire
You're what I desire
I'm comin to getcha girl
That's right, that's right
It's on tonight
Your just my type
You're what I like
I bring that heat
Ya heard me right
Everywhere I go, go
Let's go
[Verse 1: 50 Cent (Nicole)]
Somethin new
It's another episode
Music bumpin and sweatin
Drippin on the dancefloor
I like it when shorty get it back in the bag
When she do it like that
I don't know how to act
Now work it
Go ahead grind it on me
That's perfect
I'll pay to play it
If its worth it
My phone numb' if you want me (yeah)
You can chirp it (yeah)
Baby work it (yeah)
[Hook: Young Buck]
Take these bricks and break 'em down
If you want I could serve them by the pound
Shorty don't you got what I want to flip
Baby girl tell me you can handle it
[Chorus: Nicole]
Well if you want it let's go
I got that fire
So hot I'll burn it down
I think ya already know
I got that fire (fire)
I'm the flyest chick around
You want it (ooo)
It's fire (ooo)
I've got it (ooo)
That fire (ooo)
So I'm might (ooo)
Ignite ya (ooo)
It's fire (ooo)
It's fire (ooo)
[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
I burn it down on stage I make it hot
Til the fire marshals come shut down the spot
I had the club jam packed everytime I rock
These other niggas ain't got the style I got
I go back to the basics and break it all the way, all
The way down
You can hate this but face it B. I. G. and 2Pac just
Ain't around
Everywhere you go, there I go I'm 50 Cent
Yes the star at the bar, I'll get ya bent
You wanna party, let's party
You wanna freak, be a freak
You wanna creep, we can creep
Tell me what it's gonna be
So you can...
[Hook: Young Buck]
Take these bricks and break 'em down
If you want I could serve them by the pound
Shorty don't you got what I want to flip
Baby girl tell me you can handle it
[Chorus: Nicole]
Well if you want it let's go
I got that fire
So hot I'll burn it down
I think ya already know
I got that fire (fire)
I'm the flyest chick around
You want it (ooo)
It's fire (ooo)
I've got it (ooo)
That fire (ooo)
So I'm might (ooo)
Ignite ya (ooo)
It's fire (ooo)
It's fire (ooo)
Fire!!!
[Verse 3: 50 Cent (Nicole)]
Now all you really ready
I said are really ready
I make the temperature rise
Now don't be suprised
I had a ice on stunt and heavy
I got a hell of a flow
You should already know
So over 30 million records already
It's the third time around
You know how I get down
I'm hands down pound for pound
The best around
Now work it
Go ahead grind it on me
That's perfect
I'll play to play
If it's worth it
My phone numb' if you want me (yeah)
You can chirp it (yeah)
Work it (yeah)
(Woo)
