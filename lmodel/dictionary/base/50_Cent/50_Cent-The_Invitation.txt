<song artist="50_Cent" title="The_Invitation">
I had five-hundred grams in fifty, fifty-eight bags
 Four hundred Benz, eighty thousand in cash
 Then the ball dropped, gun popped, banks got blast
 I make it so hot, one shot'll melt your ass
 Got popped up, cried 'til my eyes turned red
 And told myself in the mirror, "Nigga, you ain't dead"
 I'm far from eccentric, I'm so psychotic
 I don't need you to shoot for me, nigga, I got it
 When you see me in the hood, motherfucker, don't talk to me
 'Less you want talk about usin' a Hawk for me
 When Al blew Black away I had 'em on some stupid shit
 Then my rap shit worked now I'm super, stupid rich
 All I do is stunt now, I'm so Maybach
 There I go frontin' again, I meant to say laid back
 Go ahead, move reckless, get banged for your necklace
 I serve 'em with the semi, feed 'em a clip for breakfast
 You want some? Come get some
 Nigga, it's murder one when I toss my gun
 You might see me let it off, you might see me run
 But you won't see shit time the police come, huh?
 You want some? Come get some
 Nigga, it's murder one when you see my gun
 I just squeeze and squeeze 'til the whole clip done
 You just bleed and bleed 'til the police come
 Huh, you want some?
 I got a 8th of dope left, half a pound of purple
 Shooters in my circle, try me, I let 'em murk you
 Got more guns than a gun store, beefin', what you want, boy?
 You wanna be nice to me? You wanna shoot dice with me?
 You want a ace on purpose? Why you so nervous?
 Nigga, we from the same hood, we come from the same shit
 You got gonorrhea too, we fucked with the same bitch!
 Gettin' money is necessary so me, I'm a visionary
 And I'm sayin' that house should be a crack house
 Now see it how I see it, or I bring straps out
 The Tec and the Mac out, the Sig and the Taurus
 The Koch and that Heckler then nigga, we warin'
 I let my pistol speak for me and all of 'em foreign
 Click-clack, comprende? I'm criminal minded
 Toss money in the sewer, bet nobody find it
 Till it's rusty and fucked up, forensics have fun, what?
 You want some? Come get some
 Nigga, it's murder one when I toss my gun
 You might see me let it off, you might see me run
 But you won't see shit time the police come, huh?
 You want some? Come get some
 Nigga, it's murder one when you see my gun
 I just squeeze and squeeze 'til the whole clip done
 You just bleed and bleed 'til the police come
 Huh, you want some?
 Come get it, I'm strapped now, with it
 Come get it, huh, you want some?
 Come get it, I'm strapped now, with it
 Fuck that nigga, huh, you want some?
