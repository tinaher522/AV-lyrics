[50 Cent]
New York City,
you are now rappin' with 50 Cent
you gotta love it
I just wanna chill and twist a lot
Catch suns in my 745
You drive me crazy, shorty I
Need to see you and feel you next to me
I'll provide everything you need and I
Like your smile, I don't wanna see you cry
Got some questions that I gotta ask and I
Hope you can come up with the answers babe
[Nate Dogg]
Girl, you seem to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out
Would you still, have love for me?
Girl, you seem to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still, have love for me?
[50 Cent]
If I fell off tomorrow, would you still love me?
If I didn't smell so good, would you still hug me?
If I got locked up and sentenced to a quarter century
Could I count on you to be there to support me mentally?
If I went back to a Hoop-D from a Benz
Would you poof and disappear, like some of my friends?
If I was hit and I was hurt would you be my side?
If it was time to put in work would you be down to ride?
I get out and peel a nigga cap and chill in drive
I'm asking questions to find out how you feel inside
If I ain't rap 'cause I was flip burgers in Burger King
Would you be ashamed to tell your friends you're feeling me?
In the bed, if I use my tongue would you like that?
If I wrote you a love letter, would you write back?
Now we can have a little drink, you know a Nightcap
And we can go do what you like, I know you like that
[Nate Dogg]
Girl, you seem to love me now

Would you love me if I was down and out?

Sometimes I really wanna cry, cuz the love is so good
Boy, if you really love me now
Can we walk down the aisle?
Cuz you, know I'm gonna hold you down
Cuz when you was down and out
I was still around
You gettin' money now, but I still got love for you
If you fell off tomorrow you could stay at my crib
If you didn't smell so good I still would have ur kid
If you got locked up I'd put money on ur books
