[Chorus:]
 I promise to keep you close to me you give me a sense of security

 I need you to hold me down hold me down I need you to hold me (down)
 [Verse 1:]
 Do ever your altercation I'll put no one above you omm omm I love you this shit goes to my truxium
 We see how they be lookin' it's frightenin' like lightnin' we crack off they start lookin'
