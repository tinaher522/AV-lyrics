<song artist="50_Cent" title="I_Just_Wanna">
Look nigga, if you don't love yourself
Ain't nobody gon' love you
Your shit ain't right
What bitch in her right mind gon' fuck you
That's what they told me then
So I was like "fuck a bitch"
Imma grind, Imma shine, every time blow they mind
Oh now she like me, oh oh oh now they like me
All I want is a blow job
This bitch wanna be wifey
No 3-course meal, all I want is fast food
I wanna have fun, how about a cookie huh?
I don't wanna love you
I just wanna unbutton your blouse and let the girls out
I wanna fuck you
Maybe later on, if you're free you can come to my house
Only if you want to
We can get freakier and freakier than you've ever been,
If you want to
We can get freakier and freakier you can bring a friend
Bitches from Belize, keep all in the weed
Remy crew got me sweating out a remi weave
Fuck a model tonight, my bitch is from the P's
She the project dick tease
Them hood bitches always bring back memories
They all catch the makers like "Yayo you remember me?"
I certainly do, pull the curtain on a '62
Hands was free, she on her menstrual
I promise I don't love em, I don't cuff 'em
I don't pay a bitch's rent to have the next nigga fuckin'
I'm a pimp with principles
Killin' with visuals my diamonds like twoÂ ? bitch
I don't wanna love you
I just wanna unbutton your blouse and let the girls out
I wanna fuck you
Maybe later on, if you're free you can come to my house
Only if you want to
We can get freakier and freakier than you've ever been,
If you want to
We can get freakier and freakier you can bring a friend
I don't want a relationship, I just wanna have fun
In every position, we can come up with til we're done
And my request is to be kickin' shit in my ear
Like to hear what you're thinking, after laughing and drinking
We can have a ball, we can do it all
Moonshine light up the sky at night time
With me any time could be the right time
I'm sort of impulsive, I'm kinda explosive
Me, take a little at a time in doses
Don't want you addicted, I just wanna kick it
You could pick the spot, I'll be there with the quickness
Give it to you good, when I'm gone I'm sure you gon' miss this
I don't wanna love you
I just wanna unbutton your blouse and let the girls out
I wanna fuck you
Maybe later on, if you're free you can come to my house
Only if you want to
We can get freakier and freakier than you've ever been,
If you want to
We can get freakier and freakier you can bring a friend
