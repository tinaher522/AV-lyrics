[Hook: 50 Cent]
I have nightmares, nightmares, all the time
I wake up, I look up, shook up, say fuck, put my hands on my nine
Niggas I cut, or we stuck, and they move, so we buck, they come back, in my dreams at night
I have nightmares, nightmares, all the time
[Verse 1: Prodigy]
Last night I had a vision of my dead friends in my sleep, they showed my things, I aint really wanna see
They showed me flashbacks of murder scenes, bodies bubblin, in acid tubs, with they feet head and hands cut off, oh shit, I had woke up buggin, sweatin bullets, checkin for my gun, I gotta stop smoking that haze or something, I kno I aint crazy, I'll go outside for some fresh air maybe, it's 3 oclock in the night, the block is on fire, took my nigga bottle for a swig oh the fire, he told he just had seen the bitch ass nigga, must be god that's keeping me from seein this nigga, wanna crawl on me, and creep on me, cuz they kno better then to let me see him in front of me, outside the car, away from the police, I'll turn him into dreams, demons in my sleep
[Hook]
[Verse 2: 50 cent]
Every time I go to sleep its like I stroll down memory lane, and see the dirt I've done before I quite the flame, if you can see what I see, you see me poppin the chain, or you see me scrappin, I pull out and pop off that thang, im usually hustlin, bubblin, slingin that 'caine, no matter the weather its sun snow sleet or it's rain, see fiends got a habit, it hurts so they feedin they vein, and I gotta habbit of havin grahams of it mayne, I'm chasin the paper, it' simple im bout my bread, I cock it and pop it your white tee will turn red, see niggas that know me, who owe me, they see me, they run, they know if I catch em I cut em for feed em my gun, it's real in the field, nigga front and get yo cap peeled, with that nina, that check, thatÂ ??? on that mack meal, unload and reload, I live by the streets code, and pray to lord have mercy on my soul
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Havoc]
Keep havin these dreams, I think I'm just losin my brain, I wake up in sweat, my girl think im sniffin that 'caine, I try to remember, but none of them ever the same, I dream of my brother, but never since he passed away, he talk to me, and I can't hear nothing he say, fuck it, go along with it, just be happy to see him, I think that nigga tryna tell me something though, when I see him I forget to ask him, fuck I wanan know
Probably tryna to tell me, your gun , it better blow, when you in the street, cant react slow, cuz niggas in this rap game, think shit sweet, getting disrespectful like I won't push meat, should be poppin off in my dream but then I get caught, is he tryin to tell me so my soldiers cuz you a bust, niggas wanna see my down, I aint 'fraid of getting poked, damn if I ever go broke
