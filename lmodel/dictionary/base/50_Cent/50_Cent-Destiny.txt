[Verse 1- 50 Cent]
I'm from city to city to shop the show
See me I been glidin' across the globe
I hustle hard to get the grib fa sho'
So when I make time to call you, you should pick up the phone
Tell me, whats on your mind when you're alone
Have ya touchin' on yourself, girl all in the zone
Now if I told you all
What things I say would I be wrong
Well then I wouldn't be right

Matter fact I'd be on the next flight
Tryna get it on with you tonight
Do the things you like
Touch the right spot, have ya piped and hot
While the wind blow through your hair in the drop
Just lay back, relax to the sounds of the sex
And let me to what I do until you climax
You can go straight to sleep after its all over
In the mornin' roll over and we can start over
