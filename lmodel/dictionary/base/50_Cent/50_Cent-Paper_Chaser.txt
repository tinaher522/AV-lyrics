(Intro: 50 Cent)
It's 50 man!
It's easy when you fuck with' me, man!
You don't believe me...
You ask Bank$! You ask Yayo!
The first thing they goin' say is...
(Chorus: 50 Cent {DJ Whoo Kid})
I got money - and lots of jewels and fancy cars
The bitches fuck with' me, cause I'm a paper chaseeeer!
Paid my duuueees and now I cruise with' movie staaaars
The bitches fuck with' me, cause I'm a paper chaseeeer! {DAMN! }
(50 Cent:)

Matter of fact - I think big bread kid!
I'm on dat G-550, fuck the Jet blue shit (police sirens)

Back shots in back of Maybachs, the seat back kid
I got deep in dat kitty cat, I did! I did! {50CENT! }
With' the Lionel Richie playin', it's easy like Sunday mornin'
You should hear the type of G a nigga, spit when I'm on it.

(Lloyd Bank$:)
I smell like money baby - look how the cameras flick
My hit game is insane, can you handle it?
I left a mark from here to Los Angeles
My neck wrist glamerous, my breakfast canabis!
I ain't dese washed up niggas; I'm the new thang
They could'ntcatch me with a knot in my shoe string.
And while were on the subject, check out my shoe game,
There's four G's on em; I cross seas on 'em! {DAMN! }
I'm alergic to snitches, I might sneeze on 'em
Put cheese on 'em - make everybody squeeze on 'em. (shot)
The white sheets on em - dirt and leaves on 'em
Concrete on em! - You concreep on 'em! . (echoes)
(Chorus: 50Cent)
I got money - and lots of jewels and fancy cars
The bitches fuck with' me, cause I'm a paper chaseeeer! {CAN'T FORGET... }
Paid my duuueees {NELSON! } and now I cruise with movie staaaars
The bitches fuck with' me, cause I'm a paper chaseeeer!
(Tony Yayo:)
Herme cologne! Herme soles!
Herme hat! - Herme coat.
Gucci glasses, cartier belt
Purple tag shirt - leatherful vest.
Homie products match that nigga, now I'm dress! (now I'm dress!)
Got 5 on my feet! - 40 on my neck! (40 on my neck!)
20 on my wrist! - 10 on my pinky! - That's the right pinky!
But the left pinky? {Whoooooo! } - Get me freaky, freaky girls like Pinky,
My money's long, I can get Rambo touch.
I'm in a 2010 - Lambo' truck,
Door's up! Rims high (yeah!) - this niggas gon' die! (yeah, you gon' die!)
I bulletproof, my vehicles - e'rytime I try. - Yeeeeeeaaaaaah! {DAMN! }
(Chorus: 50 Cent)
I got money - and lots of jewels and fancy cars
The bitches fuck with' me, cause I'm a paper chaseeeer! {CAN'T FORGET... }
Paid my duuueees {TRITCH! } and now I cruise with movie staaaars {LIL' NIGGA! }
The bitches fuck with' me, cause I'm a paper chaseeeer!

Like think he ain't seen what the another nigga been thru.
And don't give an no credit core, surving his battles!
But I say: "Fuck 'em! " (beat fades out)
Look at me now bitches! (beat stops) {DAMN! }
