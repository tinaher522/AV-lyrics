Who wanna play with the enforcer?
Who wanna play with the enforcer?
Who wanna play with the enforcer?
Who wanna play with the enforcer?
Who wanna play with the enforcer?
Money like a boss plus still come off you
Ferrari, Lambo, I race it, Bugatti, I chase it
I be stuntin', don't say shit, murda
Is what I get a there'll never be another me, face it
I big bread so tape it, shawty got everything you can play it
She ain't bitch like the stay with
So brave your tray, duck tape, ready
Your times up already
Black bag body bag, ready, ready, ready
Who wanna play with the enforcer
Who wanna play with the enforcer?
Who wanna play with the enforcer
Who wanna play with the enforcer?
Crazy, sip rich, still pushing narcotics
2 wanna do, I've done it
Life's going away, I won it
Ex pills drama tell me who won it
I've done it, they talk about, they frontin'
So brave your tray, duck tape, ready
Your times up already
Black bag, body bag, ready, ready, ready
Who wanna play with the enforcer
Who wanna play with the enforcer?
Who wanna play with the enforcer
Who wanna play with the enforcer?
Money like a boss plus still come off you
This sound sounds when I'm at you
This sound sounds when I'm at you
This sound sounds when I'm at you
The steamforcer mansion
This sound sounds when I'm at you
This sound sounds when I'm at you
This sound sounds when I'm at you
This sound feels when I'm blasting
Everything I do something you want to
But you don't do things that I do
'Cause you ain't got the heart to do it
You, you, you ain't got the heart to do it
You, you, you ain't got the heart to do it
Who wanna play with the enforcer?
Who wanna play with the enforcer?
Who wanna play with the enforcer?
Who wanna play with the enforcer?
Money like a boss plus still come off you
Who wanna play with the enforcer?
Who wanna play with the enforcer?
Who wanna play with the enforcer
Who wanna play with the enforcer?
Money like a boss plus still come off you
This sound sounds when I'm at you
This sound sounds when I'm at you
This sound sounds when I'm at you
The steamforcer mansion
This sound sounds when I'm at you
This sound sounds when I'm at you
This sound sounds when I'm at you
This sound feels when I'm blasting
Blasting, blasting, blasting
This sound feels when I'm blasting
