<song artist="50_Cent" title="How_We_Do">
[Chorus: 50 Cent]
This is how we do
We make a move and act a fool while we up in the club
This is how we do
Nobody do it like we do it so show us some love
This is how we do
We make a move and act a fool while we up in the club
This is how we do
Nobody do it like we do it so show us some love
[Game]
Fresh like... Impala...
Crome hydraulics, 808 drums
You don't want, none
Nigga better, run
When beef is on, I'll pop that, drum
Come get, some
Pistol grip, pump
If a nigga step on my white And, Ones
Since red, rum
Ready here I, come
Compton...
Dre found me in the, slums
Selling that skunk, one hand on my gun
I was selling rocks when Master P was saying...
Buck pass the blunt
These G-Unit girls just want to have, fun
Coke and rum
Got weed on the ton
I'm banging with my hand up her dress like...
I'll make her cum, purple haze in my lungs
Whole gang in the front in case a nigga want to, stunt
[50 Cent]
I put Lamborghini doors on that Es-co-lade
Lil pro so look like I'm riding on blades
In one year man, a nigga's so paid
I have a straight bitch in the telly going both ways (Ah!)
Touch me, tease me, kiss me, please me
I give it to ya just how you like it, girl
You know I'm rocking with the best tre pound on my hip
Teflon on my chest
They say I'm no good
Cause I'm so hood
Rich folks do not want me around
Cause shit might pop off, and if shit pop off
Somebody goin' get laid the fuck out
They call me new money, say I have no class
I'm from the bottom, I came up too fast
The hell if I care, I'm just here to get my cash
Bougie ass bitches, you can kiss my ass
[Chorus]
[Game]
I put gold Dayton's on that Cherry Six-Four
White walls so clean it's like I'm riding on bulbs
Hit one switch man, that ass so low
Cali got niggas in New York riding on hundred spokes
Touch me, tease me, kiss me, please me
I give it to ya just how you like it, girl
You know I'm rocking with the best fo' pound on my hip
Gold chain on my chest (Ah!)

[50 Cent]
50...
Bentley...
Em came 'n gotta nigga fresh out the, slum
Automatic, gun
Fuck 'em one-on-one
We wrap up ya punk ass, stunt 'n ya done
Homie, it's Game time
[Game]
You ready? Here I come
Call Lloyd Banks and get this motherfucker, crunk
It took two, months
But Fifty got it done
Signed with G-unit
Had niggas like, "huh?"
Don't try to front
I'll leave yo' ass, slumped
Thinking I'm a punk
Get your fucking head, lumped
Fifty got a, gun
[50 Cent]
Ready here he come
Gotta sick, vendetta
To get this, chedder
Meet my Ba, Retta
The dra-ma, setter
Sip Am-a, retta
My flow sounds, better
Than average
On tracks I'm a savage
I damage
Any nigga tryin' to front on my clique (G-Unit!)
