<song artist="50_Cent" title="Im_Supposed_To_Die_Tonight">
Ahh man
You know where the niggas be at right?
Take me to 'em!
[Chorus- 50 Cent]
All through the hood, I keep hearin' niggas sayin'
"I'm supposed to die tonight"
niggas come put a hit out and they talkin' like the shit okay
"I'm down to ride tonight"
We Rollin', whip stolen, AK loaded
"I'm down to ride tonight"
We smokin', Straight locin', lockin, loaded
"Somebody gonna die tonight"
[Verse 1- 50 Cent]
This is nothin' new, I been in this position before
Grandma crib, niggas outside of her door
Different day, same shit, old mac, new clip
32 hollow tips, gloves, no rubber grip
I'm a boss, but niggas never show no respect
I catch 'em slippin', I have 'em tongue kissin' my tec
won come test me, pussy boy don't try
Police responds, never fast enough, the shots fired
Don't be stupid, find out who you f**kin' wit son
'For we find out where ya b!tch gets her hair and nails done
Its elementary, life is but a dream
You know row, row ya boat, your blood forms a stream
After you get hit, you shoulda thought about the shit
You took that paper, you take a life or ya life get took b!tch
Sometimes, I sit and look at life from a different angle
Don't know if I'm God's child or I'm Satan's angel
[Chorus- 50 Cent]
All through the hood, I keep hearin' niggas sayin'
"I'm supposed to die tonight"

niggas come put a hit out and they talkin' like the shit okay
"I'm down to ride tonight"
We Rollin, whip stolen, AK loaded
"I'm down to ride tonight"
We smokin', straight locin', locked and loaded
Somebody gon' die tonight
[Verse 2- 50 Cent]
In 2002, if you asked me to make a wish
I simply woulda wished that my music would be a hit
BIG said damn, niggas wanna stick me for my paper
And pray for my downfall, I understand it all
But me, I'm a little more flashy a nigga
So chances are, I'mma have to blast me a nigga
I'm on that teflon vest shit, that wild wild west shit
And eighty one 1 carrot stones in my necklace
I shine so hard, I make mothaf**kas wanna kill me
Every projects and every hood I go, they feel me
I Know it sounds like rap, but this shit is real B
I don't talk that rich shit, but nigga I'm filthy
When I come out to play, and ma mob aint with me
You could bet your bottom dollar that revolver with me
Homeboy, frontin' on me will shorten your life span
Hold ma mic with my left, ma knife in my right hand
[Chorus- 50 Cent]
All through the hood, I keep hearin' niggas sayin'
"I'm supposed to die tonight"
niggas come put a hit out and they talkin' like the shit okay
"I'm down to ride tonight"
We rollin, whip stolen, AK loaded
I'm down to ride tonight
We smokin', straight locin', locked and loaded
"Somebody gon' die tonight"
