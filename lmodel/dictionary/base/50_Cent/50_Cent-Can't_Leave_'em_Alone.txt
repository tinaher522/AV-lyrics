<song artist="50_Cent" title="Can't_Leave_'em_Alone">
I'm focused, man
You should know this, man
Yes, one dose of me will have you addicted
To know me is to love me; I handle my business
Any city, any town; touch down, I do my thing
I'm a hustler, baby; I provide by any means
I'm a great conversationalist; you should know what I'm about
When you look at me, baby, you should see a way out
Out the hood, out the drama, out the Bentley that's on
Out the headache and stress you done been through before
It's only been three months and I already got it bad
So hood that I keep on comin' back
My girlfriends telling me I don't know how to act
But I'm tellin' them, baby, bye, fall back
He's so good, and he knows how to love me
But so hood, and he's so heavy in the streets
He's my dude, and you better get used to things
And I don't care what you say about me
They say:
That he does it with the best, runs it in the west
Padding on his chest (uh-huh)
I like it (so what), I like it
And they say (that he's gonna hurt me)
Just wait and see (but they don't know me)
Cause I am what he wants, his girl and I love it
[Chorus]
I can't leave him alone
I tried that good boy game
But the dope boys turning me on
It's just that he know what I want
So bad, I love that; I can't leave him alone
I can't leave him alone
I tried that game
But the dope boys turning me on
It's just that he know what I want
So bad, I love that; I can't leave him alone
So when I had a good guy, he didn't do that much for me
Tried to be hard but that he could never be
Always tell me that no one could compare to me
But couldn't matter when other guy was starin' at me
Now the time plays back so everyone could look at me
From the A to hill up in Beverly
He's so fly that he knows how to carry me
First class, when they talk, we don't hear what they say
That he does it with the best, runs it in the west
Padding on his chest (uh-huh)
I like it (so what), I like it
And they say (that he's gonna hurt me)
Just wait and see (but they don't know me)
Cause I am what he wants, his girl and I love it
[Chorus]
The more I get, the more my ambition tells there's more
I'll move a A for that girl, I'll move ahead on that boy
Then I flip that (double up) kick back (cuddle up)
Ya friends try to confuse, but you know what
My intentions are good; I can't help it I'm hood
I wouldn't change if I could; you shouldn't tell me I should
Baby, you should take me as I am
And be happy you're my girl 'cause I'm happy I'm ya man
I can hear your call; it just takes one call
I'll come running, boy; I promise I will be there for you
All my heart, it belongs to you
I can't lose you, boy; I just can't leave you alone
[Chorus:Repeat x2]
