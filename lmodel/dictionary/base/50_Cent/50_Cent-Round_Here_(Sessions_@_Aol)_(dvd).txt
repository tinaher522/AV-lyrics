[50 Cent]
It ain't good to good in front of niggas in the hood, right.
It ain't good to good in front of niggas in the hood, right.
Everybody know that
[Verse 1]
Doin good in front of niggas in the hood cause problems
Tre, trade pounds and (?)
I hate when hoes get on some loudmouth shit
Your man gangsta? Me too
Go on and get em bitch
I just bought new toast to spit
Next nigga gettin gully gettin laid out quick
Where ever rich touchin niggas is gettin hurt
Cause a broke nigga always down to put it in work
Don't run up on me, I don't know you nigga
So what you bought my cd, I don't owe you nigga
I know you love the way the goutti beat bump
Got you license plate rounds and all over your trunk
Don't confuse these trucks with my style dog
I'm from Queens but I'm mother f**kin B.K. hard
I sound like I move bricks uptown
More like a thug from the Bronx who stay with a 4 pound
Shook nigga (shook nigga, shook nigga)
I'm a Guiness Book nigga
[Chorus 2x]
We don't play that pussy shit round here
You can get your f**kin wig split down here
Don't rep where you come from too much around here
You can get your f**kin cap filt
[Verse 2]
If I can't get my gun in the club, why whould I come in the club
So them niggas I done stuck up could cut me he f**k up, nah
I'm outside to jump off in a benz jeep
4 deep strapped with all kinds of heat

Niggas think they want beef
They don't want beef
They find from somebody that love playin in the street
When you rap, keep it gangsta dog it's all good
Just don't go coppin that shyt in the wrong hood
But I'm from the young boy, come and try ya nigga
Shell will make ya feel like your on fire nigga
If you thinkin we thristy 'cause, we right
We lookin at your watch and chain like that's a S-type
Murder sayin don't play 50 in the club
Last time it came nigga tore the shyt up (what)
I don't where you from and I don't care
But nigga we don't play that pussy shit round here
[Chorus 2x]
[Verse 3]
(Spanish talkin)
No ingles, No ingles, mother f**kers will shoot ya
The Latin Kings don't like me, I don't care
We don't talk that mida mida bullshit round here
Man, I done so much dirt in the hood
Niggas heard I got shot they was all sayin good (do it for em)
F**k ya'll, ya aint got to like me
I'm gettin knocked,ya'll nigga aint got to like me
I'm on the same bullshit I been on
It's the same bullshit ya niggas need to get on
Ya shit sound too commercial
Come cruisin through the hood mother f**kers will hurt ya
You shouldn't them flash jewels
Cause niggas will run up on ya if thats true
They want your money, the watch, and you tenis shos
I aint gotta tell ya not to move
Ya know the rules
