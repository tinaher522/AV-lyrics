(Gun Shots)
(Chorus Akon)
Oooo dont even look at me wrong when i come through the hood
Aint nothing changed still holla at my homies
Oooo and when i hit the block i still will kill
And i dont want to, nigga but i will if i got to kill
If niggas get the f**kin around
If niggas get the f**kin around
(End Chorus)
Respect come from admiration and fear
You can admire or me or you can catch one in your wig
See the testorossa the toasta is right on my lap
So if a nigga get outta line a nigga get clapped
I got a arseanal an infatry im built for this mentally
Thats why im the general i do what they pretend to do
Front on me now nigga ill be the end of you
Forget your enemies and think of what your frieds'll do
I drop a bag off, they let a mag off
that ---- glock will tear half your ass off
im not for the games im not for all the playin
the hollow tips rain, when i unleash the pain
Get the message from the lines or get the message from the nine
Paint a picture with words you can see me when I shine
Put my back on the wall nigga watch me go for mine
I let 21 shots off all at the same time (yeah)
(Chorus Akon)
Oooo dont even look at me wrong when i come through the hood
Aint nothing changed still holla at my homies
Oooo and when i hit the block i still will kill
And i dont want to, nigga but i will if i got to kill
If niggas get the f**kin around
If niggas get the f**kin around
(End Chorus)
Where im from death is already in the air homie
Nana love me so you know she say my prayers for me
I come creeping through the hood wearin teflon
Hit the corners Muthaf**kers get left on
Niggas know if not they better check my background
Tryna stick me i'll fill your back with mack rounds
Ask pretty nigga 50 dont back down
I keep it funky like fiends in the crack house

Cross the line boy imma air ya ass out
Screw your face at me i wanna know what thas bout
Nigga i know you aint mad i done came up
And if you are f**k you cuz i aint change up
The OG's wanna talk but i dont know these niggas
And I aint did no business with em I dont owe these niggas
A minute of my time I did it cuz I grind
All across the globe like the worlds mine (yeah!)
(Chorus Akon)
Oooo dont even look at me wrong when i come through the hood
Aint nothing changed still holla at my homies
Oooo and when i hit the block i still will kill
And i dont want to, nigga but i will if i got to kill
If niggas get the f**kin around
If niggas get the f**kin around
(End Chorus)

(Akon Verse)
Now tell me have you eva looked up in an instance
And seen a mack aimin at your head mayne(head mayne)
Before you know it life is flashin -----
And your body is drippin and full of lead mayne(lead mayne)
I done been there (uh-huh) I done copped that (uh-huh)
But it aint neva been a question about that (uhhh)
Don't go there (uhhh) You'll get --- (uh-huh)
And if ya ---- f**karound and re-route that (uh-huh)
You'll neva catch me ridin around in these streets
Without a couple metal pieces under my feet
Fully automatic whippers in the --- with ---
Stash under the carpet like a can of seaweed
Fifty dont make me ride on these niggas (ay)
Cuz i will kill dip and hide on these niggas (oooohhhhh)
Fifty dont make me ride on these niggas (ay)
Cuz ill be long gone like the rippa (soooo)
(Chorus Akon)
Dont even look at me wrong when i come through the hood
Aint nothing changed still holla at my homies
Oooo and when i hit the block i still will kill
And i dont want to, nigga but i will if i got to kill
If niggas get the f**kin around
If niggas get the f**kin around
(End Chorus)
