<song artist="50_Cent" title="Wangster">
It's 50 A.K.A. Ferrari, F 50
Break it down
I got a lot of living to do for a die
And I ain't got time to waste
Let's make it
You said you a gangster
But you neva pop nothin'
You said you a wangster
And you need to stop frontin'
You ain't a friend of mine
You ain't a kind of mine
What makes you think that
I'ma run up on you with the nine
We do this all the time
Right now we on the grind
So hurry up and cop
And go we selling nicks and dimes
Shorty, she so fine
I gotta make her mine
A ass like that gotta be one of kind
I crush 'em everytime
Punch 'em with every nine
I'm fucking with they mind
I make 'em press rewind
They know they can't shine if I'm around the rhyme
Land on paroza's 94, 'cause I commit the crime
I send you my line, I did it three3 to nine
The D's ran up in my crib
You know who dropping dimes
You said you a gangster
But you neva pop nothin'
You said you a wangster
And you need to stop frontin'
You go to the dealership
But you neva cop nothin'
You been hustling a long time
And you ain't got nothin'
You said you a gangster
But you neva pop nothin'
You said you a wangster
And you need to stop frontin'
You go to the dealership
But you neva cop nothin'
You been hustling a long time
And you ain't got nothin'
Damn Homie, In high school you was the man homie+
What the fuck happened to you
I got the sickest vendetta when it come to the cheddar
And if you play with my paper, you gonna meet my Berreta
Now shorty think I'ma sweat her, sipping on a mereda
I'm living once than deta, I know I can do betta
She look good but I know she after my cheddar
She tryna get in my pockets, homie and I ain't gonna let her
Be easy, stop the bullshitting, you get your whole crew wet
We in the club doing the same ol' two step
Gorilla unit, 'cause they say we bugged out
'Cause we don't go nowhere without toast we thugged out
You said you a gangster
But you neva pop nothin'
You said you a wangster
And you need to stop frontin'
You go to the dealership
But you neva cop nothin'
You been hustling a long time
And you ain't got nothin'
You said you a gangster
But you neva pop nothin'
You said you a wangster
And you need to stop frontin'
You go to the dealership
But you neva cop nothin'
You been hustling a long time
And you ain't got nothin'
Me, I'm no mobster, me, I'm no gangster
Me, I'm no hitman me I'm just me, me
Me, I'm no wangster, me, I'm no actor
But it's me you see on your TV
'Cause I hustle, baby, this Spanish shit is so easy
I'm getting what you get for a brick to talk greasy
By any means, partner, I got to eat on these streets
If you play me close, for sure I'm gonna pop my heat
Niggas saying they going murph 50 how
We riding round with guns the size of little, bow wow
What you know about A.K. and A.R.15's
Equipped with night vision, shell catchers and dem things, huh
You said you a gangster
But you neva pop nothin'
You said you a wangster
And you need to stop frontin'
You go to the dealership
But you neva cop nothin'
You been hustling a long time
And you ain't got nothin'
Ah hah, damn homie
