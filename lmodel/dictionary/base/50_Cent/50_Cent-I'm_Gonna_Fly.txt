<song artist="50_Cent" title="I'm_Gonna_Fly">
If you looked inside of me
Would it be the same thing that I see?
A heart of endless dreams, so much I wanna give
Now I'm dancing in the light, I finally feel alive(finally feel alive)
It's what I need to set it free
Chorus
I'm gonna fly so high
I'm gonna reach the sky
I'm gonna be a star
Move my feet to the beat of my heart
I'm gonna fly so high
Bringing the sun into the night
Make you believe in me
It's my destiny
Rising to a brand new day
Working hard to find another way
Fear wont keep me down, will you be around?
More than just a fantasy
Lookin' up through the words in front of me
Cant you see...im running free!
Chorus
I'm gonna fly so high
I'm gonna reach the sky
I'm gonna be a star
Move my feet to the beat of my heart
I'm gonna fly so high
Bringing the sun into the night
Make you believe in me
It's my destiny
Live my dreams out loud
Go to higher ground
The greatest love is what I found
I'll give you more...give you morrrrrrre
Chorus
I'm gonna fly so high (so high)
I'm gonna reach the sky (reachh the sky)
I'm gonna be a star (oooo)
Move my feet to the beat of my heart
I'm gonna fly so high (soo high)
Bringing the sun into the night (sun into)
Make you believe in me
It's my destiny (ooo) 
I'm gonna fly so high (I'm gonna fly baby)
I'm gonna reach the sky (I'm gonna reachh the sky)
I'm gonna be a star (oooo)
Move my feet to the beat of my heart
I'm gonna fly so high 
Bringing the sun into the night 
Make you believe in me (believe)
It's my destiny (ooo destinyyyyyyyyyy)
