<song artist="50_Cent" title="High_All_Da_Time">
(Chorus) 
I don't need Don Perignon I don't need Cris 
Tangaray and Alize I don't need shit 
Nigga I'm high all the time I smoke that good shit 
I stay high all the time and I'm on some hood shit 
Give me some dro, purple haze and some chocolate 
Give me a dutch and a lighter I spark shit 
I stay high all the time, I smoke that good shit 
I'm high all the time and I'm on some hood shit 
(Verse 1) 
Everytime I roll up, niggas I holla roll up 
Then I tell 'em hold up 
You aint needing money u aint smoking in my benzo 
20 inch Lorenzo, smoking  on indo 
High as a motherfucker, I be on the backstreets 
Niggas know I clap heat 
Homie if u got beef, man u betta holla at me 
Niggas get locked up, stabbed up, shot up 
Everytime I pop up a lot going on in my hood 
I shoot the dice and holla "get 'em girls"
Daddy need new shoes 
Daddy need Pirellis to look mean on 22s 
Stash spots, X-Box, Lab top fax machine phone 
Bulletproof this bitch and I'm gone 
2003 Suburban swerving, too many sips of Henny 
The D said they searched the weapon they can't find the semis 
They was just harassing me cuz they knew who I was 
Spent the night in central booking for smoking some buds 
(Chorus) 
(Verse 2) 
Now if u heard now I'da started some shit 
It aint because I be high, I be high, I be high 
And if u heard I'd done let off a clip 
It aint because I be high, I be high 
But I twist that, la la la la 
I get high as I wanna nigga, go against me for sure yousa gonner nigga 
I don't smoke to calm my nerves but I got beef 
Fit to crush my enemies like I crush the ass cheeks
If you love me tell me u love me, don't stab me man 
I hate to be in the pens for clappin one of my fans 
Now let me show u how to greet me when u meet me 
When you see me, if you real my nigga 
You know how to holla "G-UNIT"
There's no competition, there's just me 
50 cent muthafucka I'm hot on these streets 
If David could go against goliath with a stone 
I could go at Nas and Jigga both for the throne 
(Chorus) 
(Verse 3) 
Now who u know besides me who write lines and squeeze 9s 
And have hoes in the hood sniffin on white lines 
You don't want me to be your kid's role model 
I teach 'em how to buck them 380s and load up them hollows 
Have shorty freshin for stoop, ready to shoot 
Big blunt in his mouth, duce duce in his boot 
Sit in the crib, sipping Guinness 
Watching menace then o lord 
Have a young nigga buckin shit like he old dawg 
My team they depend on me when its crunch time 
I eat a nigga food in broad day like its lunch time 
You feeling brave nigga go ahead, get gully 
See if I'ma leave your brains leaking up out your skully 
I'd done made myself hot so aint shit u can tell me 
Now niggas calling me the feature man, fuck your money 
I aint hurting I'm aight, nigga I'm doing good 
I aint got to write rhymes I got bricks in the hood 
(Chorus)
