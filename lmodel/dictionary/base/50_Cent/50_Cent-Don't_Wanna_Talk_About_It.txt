<song artist="50_Cent" title="Don't_Wanna_Talk_About_It">
I don't wan' talk about it
Man, I don't wanna talk about it
Man, I don't wan' talk about it
And I don't wanna talk about it
I make millions quick and I don't wan' talk about it
Nah, I don't wanna talk about it
I shoot a nigga kid and I don't wan' talk about it
Nah, I don't wanna talk about it
I fuck the baddest bitches, I don't wan' talk about it
Nah, I don't wanna talk about it
I'm still flippin' chickens, I don't wan' talk about it
Nah, I don't wanna talk about it
Go 'head, ask me what I'm ridin' in so I can say the Enzo
My bitch roll down the window so I could feel the wind blow
Got big enough for me to fiddle on my kinfolk
Bitches with me cruisin', 'Moulin Rouge' and
They fuckin' and they strippin' nigga
I ain't even trippin' nigga
Me I handle business, God's my only witness
Watchin' homicide, sayin', "Who the fuck did this?"
Me I run the street mayne, so I keep the heat mayne
Sews what you reap, when you fuck with the elite mayne
I don't fuck around boy, you better ask around boy
I hit you with the pound, leave yo' ass on the ground
For you poppin' that bullshit, like I don't pull shit
Fully loaded clips and whips, get the grip, clip the bricks
Nigga we hittin' licks, stickin' shit, gettin' rich
That's why my name ring bells all around this bitch
Any hood you go through they know 50 Cent
I make millions quick and I don't wan' talk about it
Nah, I don't wanna talk about it
I shoot a nigga kid and I don't wan' talk about it
Nah, I don't wanna talk about it
I fuck the baddest bitches, I don't wan' talk about it
Nah, I don't wanna talk about it
I'm still flippin' chickens, I don't wan' talk about it
Nah, I don't wanna talk about it
