<song artist="50_Cent" title="Fat_Bitch">
Yea, we over here, with some fat chicks, haha
(50 Cent)
Yo, I don't be fucking with them fat bitches
That's Yayo, all the fat bitches
(Chorus)
Don't be stuck on the things they say, now you know it's a nasty world
I ain't fucking with you anyway, 'cause I know you're a nasty girl 
I ain't ever gonna discriminate, so let me compliment your eyes 
(50 Cent)
Fat, fat, them Snickers got your ass getting fat, fat
Those cookies got your ass getting fat, fat
That Cake got your ass getting fat, fat
Bitch you grown, that ain't baby fat, fat
(50 Cent)
In the gym I see your ass up on the Stairmaster  
But you got it on level two bitch go a little faster 
Look girl, I ain't gonna lie, I'll tell you how I feel 
They should handcuff your big ass to the treadmill 
You wanna work out now, 'cause you know it's getting hot 
And your big ass fitting to pop all up out a halter top 
Find a right chick wearing some tight shit and it's on 
See your ass wear some tight shit we like, "She wrong"
(Chorus)
Don't be stuck on the things they say, now you know it's a nasty world
I ain't fucking with you anyway, 'cause I know you're a nasty girl 
I ain't ever gonna discriminate, so let me compliment your eyes 
(50 Cent)
That Burger King done got your ass fat, fat
McDonald's done got your ass fat, fat
That Domino's done got your ass fat, fat
Fat, Fat
(Lloyd Banks)
I like 'em slim in the waste
Curves in the right place
A bitch with hips, lips, and a tight face 
Your appetite will put a dent up in a nigga's salary
You need to stop burning that weed and burn them calories
Your attitude is like you always had gear
You got a ponytail, you ain't always have hair 
I just love to see your capris coming down, mami leave
On the town, stay away if you 300 pounds
(Chorus)
Don't be stuck on the things they say, now you know it's a nasty world
I ain't fucking with you anyway, 'cause I know you're a nasty girl 
I ain't ever gonna discriminate, so let me compliment your eyes 
(50 Cent)
Fat, fat, them cinnasticks got your ass fat, fat
Them Little Debbie's done got your ass fat, fat
These cupcakes done got your ass fat, fat
Fat, fat
(Tony Yayo)
I ain't gonna trip, I hang at the bar with my wallet
I'm freaking off in your car or your closet
And ain't nothing wrong with a big, strong girl
If you could cook your ass off, I'll give you the world
You could be skinny or fat, white or black
Nigga pussy is pussy, so yea, I'll hit that
I'm a freak, so I love menage a trois
And I really care less if you twice my size
(Chorus)
Don't be stuck on the things they say, now you know it's a nasty world
I ain't fucking with you anyway, 'cause I know you're a nasty girl 
I ain't ever gonna discriminate, so let me compliment your eyes 
(50 Cent)
Them Snickers got your ass getting
Those cookies got your ass getting fat, fat
That Cake got your ass getting fat, fat
Bitch you grown, that ain't baby fat, fat
(50 Cent)
Stay the fuck away from me, fucken fat bitch
Fuck with Tony Yayo ho
Uh, oh, stop, don't you touch me
I mean this shit ho
