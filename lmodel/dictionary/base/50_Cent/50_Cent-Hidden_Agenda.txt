<song artist="50_Cent" title="Hidden_Agenda">
C'mon baby (c'mon baby, c'mon baby)
Do do do do do (Do do do do do, Do do do do do)
Oohh Yeah (Oohh yeah, Oohh Yeah)
C'mon (c'mon, c'mon)
Now Baby, he keeps on sayin' and he tells you you're the only one
But everybody knows he's out there havin' fun
Behind your back, and that's a fact
And it ain't right
Cause he's a fly guy acting like a gentlemen 
But back in the day I can still remember when
He'd just turn around, wouldn't looked twice at you
(Hook:)
And I, just being straight with you
Cause He, Takes you for a fool
So you, should be on your guard
When he thinks you don't have a clue
And I, keep the truth be known
That you, and don't fall alone
When He, gets everything he wants
So girl open up your eyes and see
With me...
(Chorus:)
What you see is what you get 
No hidden agenda 
So girlfriend when he's playing around
You better remember
What you see is what you get 
No hidden agenda 
So girlfriend when he's playing around
You better remember
Now Lady
When he tells you that he loves you and wont give you up
Takes your car and it's your money that be fillin' it up
With the wad he's got, this he hit the jackpot
And it ain't right
Cause yourÂ ?? keep him sweet and that's so typical
He's only in it for himself and that's so cynical
He'd be out of site if girl, you lost it all
(Hook 2:)
So I, feel so bad inside
When He's, crusin' in your ride
Cause I know, baby, late at night,
There's some other girl by his side
And I, wanna let you know
That he, really outta go
And you, should believe in me
Cause I care baby, can't you see...
(Chorus:)
What you see is what you get 
No hidden agenda 
So girlfriend when he's playing around
You better remember
No baby girl, when he does you wrong
I'll make sure that you're alright, yeah
I just wanna be your friend
Cause there's no reason to pretend
And that's the difference with me, Oohh girl
(Chorus:)
What you see is what you get 
No hidden agenda 
So girlfriend when he's playing around
You better remember
What you see is what you get 
No hidden agenda 
So girlfriend when he's playing around
You better remember
