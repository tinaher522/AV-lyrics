Hey, pass that nigga, we gettin' high
Yo, yo this is some bomb shit right here man
50 can't even smoke this motherfucker
(Ah ha ha, ha ha)
I can't smoke weed, 'cause my PO make me piss in a cup
Nigga go ahead, disrespect me, I'll fuck you up
I ain't talkin' about a fist fight, I'll cut you up
Yo don't want stitches in yo grill motherfucker then chill
As a young buck, niggas always knew I puff
You see me go to school, on a smoiler bus
(Woo)
I'm a speed kid, I'm gettin' all this paper
(Uh huh)
You should sit, scribble lines and see where it take ya
Had violent tendencies so they thought I was dumb
Why the so called smart kids was poppin' guns
I think about poppin' a gun and then get the lump sum
Grampa my role model, used to suck on a bottle
A pint a Crown Royal, make your insides boil
Been smell like Ben Gay, 'cause his back go out
He the one that taught me, what bein' blacks about
Now peep the roach on the walls that fall and crawl on my friend's wrist
Sittin' up in the Benz to be in the pen
In the hood we hit the number but never the lotto
Life in the fast lane, one wheel hit the pothole
Let's go, let's flow nigga
War, what is it good for, absolutely nothin'
But niggas keep frontin'
Fuck a nigga, live like a soldier
Die like a soldier
War, what is it good for, absolutely nothin'
But niggas keep frontin'
Fuck a nigga, live like a soldier
Die like a soldier
War, state of mercy nigga you see me pop off nigga
Ain't no peace talk, bitch ass nigga
Fake gangsta nigga, you want to seem nigga
(Yeah)
You don't seem nigga, yeah nigga
Right? Kay slay, Whoo Kid, 50 Cent, new shit
My nigga Lloyd Banks, Tony Yayo, G-Unit
Niggas, niggas, 'Rotten Apple'
And nigga shy money, ain't fail nigga uh huh, ya heard
