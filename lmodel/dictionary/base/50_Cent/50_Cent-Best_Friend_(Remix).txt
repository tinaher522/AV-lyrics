<song artist="50_Cent" title="Best_Friend_(Remix)">
Yeah! It's my tape man, listen to my tape
WOO!!!
I've waited I've waited
Time went by
All I did was cry
Sillyyyyy
[Chorus]
If I was your best friend, I want you 'round all the time (I want you 'round me all the time)
Can I be your best friend, if you promise you'll be mine (Girl promise you'll be mine)
Please say he's just a friend (Uh huh) now girl let's not pretend (Come on)
Either he is or he ain't your man (Ha Ha!) please say he's just a friend
If I was your best friend
[Verse 1]
First we get the talkin, then we get the touchin
If we get pass the phone games we'll be f**kin
I kiss like the french, then put ma tongue in your ear
Do it like the dogs do it girl and pull on your hair
For me a different scenery just mean a different position
In the tub or on the sink I improvise now listen
In the chopper or on the jet join the mile high club
I'm no fool I know money can't buy me love
[Olivia]
You said that I could call U whenever I needed some one to listen to me
That's why I'm here standing by your side cause your always come thru for me
So many others tried to be where you are but they just wanted to do me
But you took your time and now I'm satisfied that's why I want U all to me
Cause if you were my best friend id want U round all the time
Can I be your best friend I promise boy you'll be mine
I said he's just a friend baby its not pretend either he is or he aint my man
I said he's just a friend
[Chorus]
If I was your best friend, I want you 'round all the time (I want you 'round me all the time)
Can I be your best friend, if you promise you'll be mine (Girl promise you'll be mine)
Please say he's just a friend (Uh huh) now girl let's not pretend (Come on)
Either he is or he ain't your man (Ha Ha!) please say he's just a friend
If I was your best friend

[Verse 2]
While you in your bubble bath I'll come wash on your back
When you puttin on your lotion I can help you with that
I sit and think of things to say that may make you smile
Or give you gifts from my heart to reflect my style
Or slang I use when we build may change how you talk
And if I'm focused while I'm strokin I could change how you walk
There's a swagger that you calm but when you come from New York
I'm a hustler I just hustle in the things that I bought
Separate Cmon
[Olivia]
Im not affraid you explore my body
Oo give me that feeling now we can watch some tv
Or play a cd mabye that sexual healing
You try to sing to me but your never on the key
But u do it just to appese me
Id rather spend my time wasting time with you
You ooooh you make it so easy
Cause if you were my best friend id want U round all the time(i'd want u round all the time)
Can I be your best friend I promise boy you'll be mine(please baby be mine)
I said he's just a friend baby its not pretend either he is or he aint my man
I said he's just a friend
We been better then friends
For a long time
Aint no need to pretend
You'll always be mine
We been better then friends
For a long time
Aint no fibbing or faking
You'll always be mine
[Chorus]
If I was your best friend, I want you 'round all the time (I want you 'round me all the time)
Can I be your best friend, if you promise you'll be mine (Girl promise you'll be mine)
Please say he's just a friend (Uh huh) now girl let's not pretend (Come on)
Either he is or he ain't your man (Ha Ha!) please say he's just a friend
If I was your best friend
