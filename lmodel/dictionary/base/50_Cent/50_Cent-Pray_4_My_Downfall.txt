<song artist="50_Cent" title="Pray_4_My_Downfall">
[Chorus:]
Pray and pray and pray for my downfall
Pray and pray and pray for my downfall
Pray and pray and pray for my downfall
Pray and pray and pray for my downfall
[Verse 1:]
Menace, scene from the movie, clap the two, weigh the oozie
Goodfella jewelry heist, diamonds in my bitch doobie
I sit back, think about the cats, they hate man I laugh at them
Get outta line I blast at them
They stay scheming, fuck around let off a clip and leave the whip leaning 
They dreaming, I took the cream and
Move to new places, new faces
Fuck the screw faces, shit
Cause when I flip I make the paper
Dangerous, G-Unit, niggas can't bang with us
It's undeniable the kid is nice 
The flow CPR, I'll bring Biggie back to life
Man, Dre say I'm loony, Em say I'm moody, at least I don't smoke oolies
And fuck without rubbers
A handful of niggas hate, but the hood love us
You can pray for my downfall motherfuckers
[Chorus:]
Pray and pray and pray for my downfall
Pray and pray and pray for my downfall
Pray and pray and pray for my downfall
Pray and pray and pray for my downfall
Pray and pray and pray for my downfall
Pray and pray and pray for my downfall
Pray and pray and pray for my downfall
Pray and pray and pray for my downfall
[Verse 2:]
Even if I slip, I'll get back, nigga act up
Hollowtips'll tear your back up
Gain 30 pounds when you die, no lie
I was high when they hit me
Had a few gats with me, shit
Ain't get a chance to let off
They shot me up and sped off
Apologies in order, Tamia I adore her
But now they strict cause my flow make money flow like water
Turn it up a notch, twist the dutch, zone to this, soak it up
See me in the club son I'll send niggas to poke you up
You know my style 40 cal. with me when I move around
Squeeze, catch the shell and run before your ass hit the ground
Pussy niggas shouldn't talk, keep my name out your mouth
Summerjam, understand, I'm the man, when I leave the crowd leave
Shook closer, game over
Ride or get rolled over
[Chorus:]
Pray and pray and pray for my downfall
Pray and pray and pray for my downfall
Pray and pray and pray for my downfall
Pray and pray and pray for my downfall
Pray and pray and pray for my downfall
Pray and pray and pray for my downfall
Pray and pray and pray for my downfall
Pray and pray and pray for my downfall
