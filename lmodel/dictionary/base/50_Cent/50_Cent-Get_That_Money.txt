[Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]
We poppin' them bottles every time we pose and
Takin' planes to Atlanta where they throws them bows and
Pull up in Rovers baggin' the finest hos man
Takin' pictures with bitches in designer clothes and
Niggas schemin' cause everybody's neck is froze and
We comin' through stuntin' fuck it bow down to no man
Startin' trouble for no reason we up to no good
Playin' the block all season nigga i'm so hood
Holdin' it down
Bringin' pounds through the ghetto
Baguette it down rocks colored blue and yellow
We ruin marriages nigga ya lady mine
What farmer where vests on they P-89s?
Clear from the cops no time for no baby crimes
Pushin' them drops you know the Mercedes kind
The most hated
And anticipated
Since N.W.A.
Clear the way
[Chorus: 50 Cent &amp; (Wacko)]
I got that trey pound with me now
(I got that nine with me)
Niggas know how I get down
(You want to grind with me)
20 inch chrome spin
(Come on and shine with me)
Lets get that money man
(Lets get that money man)
I got that trey pound with me now
(I got that nine with me)
Niggas know how I get down
(You want to grind with me)
20 inch chrome spin
(Come on and shine with me)
Lets get that money man
(Lets get that money man)
[Verse 2: Wacko]
Whats the deal dog? do a nigga got to bash your face?
Get your shit bust up just to pass the day
I pull a fifth from my hip and let it blast away
And then three days later watch the pastor pray
God forbid
You don't know how hard it is
Me and my brother we didn't come up like no Cosby kids
We got together like "Man we got to rob these kids"
When the last time you looked off in mama's fridge?
Wheres the mask?
Give it up wheres the stash?
Yeah the dope all here but nigga wheres the cash?
I got ya kid
And he ain't really got to live
Unless you got something that you really got to give
Thats common sense
And I ain't been common since
I slipped up and made these same promises
Problem is:
I can't keep them
And we ain't even
And you get your son back when he ain't breathing
[Chorus: 50 Cent &amp; (Wacko)]
I got that trey pound with me now
(I got that nine with me)
Niggas know how I get down
(You want to grind with me)
20 inch chrome spin
(Come on and shine with me)
Lets get that money man
(Lets get that money man)
I got that trey pound with me now
(I got that nine with me)
Niggas know how I get down
(You want to grind with me)
20 inch chrome spin
(Come on and shine with me)
Lets get that money man
(Lets get that money man)
[Verse 3: Skip]
Man fuck them other niggas
Cause i'm down for my niggas
I'm about to blaze with the Mac and spit rounds for my niggas
Tear down for niggas
Make 'em drown for my niggas
Fuck it I touch white and brown for my niggas
Get in front of a judge and twist browns for my niggas
The raw slow I get bricks and pounds for my niggas
You the sound of a nigga
Thats my round with a nigga
Juvenile sicker than beef by the pound with it nigga
Get ya town with it nigga
And it'll be all over
Come in here with gorillas dog all on ya
L-B- T-C- 6 and we the raw soldiers
Black shirts, black jeans, black kicks and all Rovers
No seeds, no sticks, no stems all Doja
Tec-9, Macs and Kays all toasters
Sprewells, weed to blaze no roasters
Pull up in the parking lot with no chaueffer
[Chorus: 50 Cent &amp; (Wacko)]
I got that trey pound with me now
(I got that nine with me)
Niggas know how I get down
(You want to grind with me)
20 inch chrome spin
(Come on and shine with me)
Lets get that money man
(Lets get that money man)
I got that trey pound with me now
(I got that nine with me)
Niggas know how I get down
(You want to grind with me)
20 inch chrome spin
(Come on and shine with me)
Lets get that money man
(Lets get that money man)
