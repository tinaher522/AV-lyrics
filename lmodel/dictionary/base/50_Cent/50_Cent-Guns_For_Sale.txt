Got that 9mm got that 10mm

(Verse One) 
Waddadaday, waddadaday, I'm the reason those things in my hood go BANG 
I got that trey duece I call that, my nigga behave 
16 gage in case these niggaz wanna get crazy 
when a sawed off

when that AK switch from automatic to spray 
everybody out this bitch could get hit with a stray 
I got silences and scopes 
military issue pistols holla at me

dump a clip out this bitch and see how niggaz act then 
Got guns and ammo they all for sale

(Verse Two) 
Fresh out the box 40 cali glock, calicos 100 shot 
streetsweepers clear the block 
im that nigga niggaz call when those shots pop 
take 'em to my grandmomma basement 
show 'em what I got, look 
I got three 380s a tech and two m1's 
Ice came through on some shit and bought him one 
Them young boys from the projects crazy 
He was kissing on the toes and saying thats my baby 
Buck came through saying "50 show me some love" 
sold him a dub dub something he can sneak in the club 
gave him some shells for that trey 8 snub 
he gave me some bud 
I gave him a pound, gave me a hug 
love, its love I take it back to the NWA days 
Fuck Jay my CD's raise the crime rate in the chart state 
got some rugers, some sigs, some colts 
my nigga for real. Holla at the kid 
(chorus) 
we got those semi automatics 
and we got those revolvers 
we that niggaz that you should get at 
if you got a problem 
when those hollow tips hit 'em 
man that should solve 'em 
we got the lugers with rugers and m1s and they all for sale 
Got that 9mm got that 10mm 
got that little duece duece and they all for sale 
got that old trey pound 
got that new fore pound 
dey bin used once or twice and they all for sale
