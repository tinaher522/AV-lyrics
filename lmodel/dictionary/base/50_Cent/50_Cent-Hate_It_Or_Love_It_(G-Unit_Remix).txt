50 Cent:
Yeah, let's take 'em back
Uh huh
Comin' up, I was confused, my mommy kissin' a girl
Confusion occurs comin' up in the cold world
Daddy ain't around, probably out commitin' felonies
My favorite rapper used to sing, "Check, check out my melody"
I wanna live good, so shit I sell dope
Four, four finger ring, one of them gold ropes
Lana told me if I passed I'd get a sheepskin coat
If I can move a few packs I'd get the hat, now that'd be dope
Tossed and turned in my sleep that night
Woke up the next mornin', niggaz had stole my bike
Different day, same shit, ain't nuttin' good in the hood
I'd run away from this bitch and never come back if I could
50 Cent, (The Game):
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homie until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P.
And I ain't goin' nowhere, so you can get to know me
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homie until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P.
And I ain't goin' nowhere, so you can get to know me
The Game:
I told Dre from the gate, I'd carry the heat for ya
First mix tape song, I'd inherited beef for ya
Gritted my teeth for ya, G-G-G-G for ya
Put Compton on my back when you was in need of soldiers
At my last show, I threw away my NWA gold
And had the whole crowd yellin' 'Free Yayo'
So niggas better get up outta mine
Fo' I creep and turn your projects into Columbine
And I'm Raps MVP
Don't make me remind y'all what happened in DC
This nigga ain't Gotti, he pretend
Mad at us 'cause Ashanti got a new boyfriend
And it seems your little rat turned out to be a mouse
This beef shit is for the birds and the birds fly south
Even Young Buck could vouch, when the dotch was out
Who gave the West Coast mouth to mouth?
50 Cent, (Lloyd Banks):
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homie until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P.
And I ain't goin' nowhere, so you can get to know me
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homie until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P.
And I ain't goin' nowhere, so you can get to know me
50 Cent:
From the beginnin' to the end, losers lose
Winners win this is real we ain't got to pretend
The cold world that we in, is full of pressure and pain
I thought it would change, it's staying the same
Lloyd Banks:
How many of them boys is with you?
When you had that little TV you had to hit on to get a picture
I'm walking with the snub
'Cause, niggas do alot of slip talking in the club
Till they coughin' on the rug
I ain't ever had much but a walkman and a bud
My role model is gone, snortin' up his drug
I've had enough, they want me to choke
My boy just got poked in the throat
Now its an R.I.P. shirt and my coat
Now I'm seein', reminiscin'
All of my weed here, never listen
If I see him, then I'mma lift him
And maybe I oughta even the score
But if not, It'll be me on the floor
50 Cent, (Tony Yayo):
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homie until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P.
And I ain't goin' nowhere, so you can get to know me
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homie until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P.
And I ain't goin' nowhere, so you can get to know me
Tony Yayo:
I started out at 15 scared as hell
I took 30 off a pack and I made them sales
As a youth, man I used to hustle for loot
With that Lou Deuce Deuce and my Triple Phat Goose
Sippin' Easy Jesus, rockin' the Leases
Mama whip me when she find my pieces
I look back on life and think God I'm blessed
We the best on the planet so forget the rest
Young Buck:
You know I'm still nice with my cook game
Look Mayne, It's a hood thang
Thats why I'm loved in Brooklayne
I handle mine just like a real nigga should
If I do some time, homie I'm still all good
Let me show you what a thug bout born to die
I take the bullets out of 50, put 'em in my 4-5
And I ain't even got my feet wet yet
A seven-figure nigga who ain't seen a royalty check
50 Cent, (Young Buck):
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homie until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P.
And I ain't goin' nowhere, so you can get to know me
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homie until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P.
And I ain't goin' nowhere, so you can get to know me
