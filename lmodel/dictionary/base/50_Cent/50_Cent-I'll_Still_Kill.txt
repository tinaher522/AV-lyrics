<song artist="50_Cent" title="I'll_Still_Kill">
[Chorus - Akon]
Ohhh
Don't even look at me wrong when I come through the 'hood
Ain't nothin' changed, still holla at my homies
And when I hit the block, I still will kill
And I don't want, nigga but I will
If I got to, kill
If niggas get to fuckin' around, if niggas get to fuckin' around
[Verse 1 - 50 Cent]
Respect come from admiration and fear
You can admire if you can catch one in ya wig
You see the Testarosa the toaster's right on my lap
So if a nigga get out of line a nigga get clapped
I got an arsenal a infantry, I'm built for this mentally
That's why I'm the general, I do what they pretend to do
Front on me now nigga I'll be the end of you
Forget ya enemies and think of what'cha friends'll do
I drop a bag off, then let a mag off
The Heckler &amp; Koch'll tear half of ya ass off
I'm not for the games I'm not for all the playin'
The hollow tips rain, when I unleash the pain
Get the message from the lions or get the message from the nine
Paint a picture wit' words, you can see when I shine
Put my back on the wall nigga watch me go for mine
I let twenty-one shots off at the same time, yeah
[Chorus - Akon]
[Verse 2 - 50 Cent]
Where I'm from death is always in the air homie
Nanna love me so you know she say my prauers for me
I come creepin' through in the 'hood wearin' teflon
Hit the corners muthafuckas get left on
Niggas know, if not they better check my background
Try and stick me I fill ya back wit' mac rounds
Ask 'Preme nigga 50 don't back down
I keep it funky like fiends in a crack house
Cross the line boy I'mma air ya ass out
Screw ya face at me I wan' know what that's 'bout
Nigga I know you ain't mad I done came up
And if you are, fuck you 'cause I ain't change up
The O.G.'s wanna talk but I don't know these niggas
And I ain't did no business wit' 'em I don't owe these niggas
A minute of my time, I get it 'cause I grind
All across the world like the globe's mine, yeah!
[Chorus - Akon]
[Verse 3 - Akon]
Konvict
Now tell me have you ever looked up at an instance
And seen a mac aimin' at'cha head mayne?
Before you know it life is flashin' reminiscin'
And ya body is drippin' and full of lead mayne
I done been there, I done cocked that
It ain't never been a question I'm 'bout that
Don't go there, ya can cock that
And if ya plan to fuck around then reroute that
You never catch me ridin' around on these streets
Without a couple metal pieces under my feet
Fully automatic weapons and loaded wit' dumb-d's
Stashed up under the carpet like a can of Seabreeze
50 don't make me ride on these niggas
'Cause I will kill, dip and hide on these niggas
50 don't make me ride on these niggas
'Cause I'll be long gone like the Ripper, so
[Chorus - Akon]
