AOWWWW! It hurts...
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah - YEAH!!
D's tryin to plant a murder on me
In the precinct they sayin I done murdered homey
I told my lawyer I ain't heard of homey
And e'rybody know my niggaz buried him fo' me
You see Hamo on your crib it ain't a burglary homey
They fin' to have me stuck in purgatory
I'm down to do the stickin when it come to the orgy
Conventional methods of sex, totally bore me
Wait! I'm gettin sidetracked, back to the story
These cocksuckin detectives got it in fo' me
They flash the lights they wanna rough me up
Frisk me find my burner and cuff me up
But history repeats itself, they never learn
The Unit's the new people who gon' behead burns
Huh, we'll find out when niggaz let off the rounds
And his partner's screamin officer down
[Chorus]
Police get in the way, I'll murder dem
I'll murder dem
A nigga already got three strikes, I'll murder dem
I said I'll murder dem
Any motherfucker touch me, I'll murder dem
I'll murder dem
You don't believe me wait and see, I'll murder dem
You see I told you I'd murder dem
[50 Cent]
They sayin I'm an accident waitin to happen
I got one in the head, I'm just waitin to clap it
A pimp told me I was made for this mack shit
So just get you a white girl, don't fuck with no black bitch
I got two felonies, from sellin that crack shit
And the third one, came from showin niggaz my mac spit
See I'm down for that daytime action
Have niggaz crawlin under cars when I start to cappin
So they don't know what to say to the Captain
But they know if word get back, somethin gon' happen
I've been shot, I've been stabbed, but I ain't been snitched on
When you snitchin where I'm from you gon' get your shit blown
Southside - I make the best of the worst
We gotta share the same bitch, okay I go first
Cause your, baby's momma is my, baby's momma
I come through to see my little nigga with the llama
[Chorus]
