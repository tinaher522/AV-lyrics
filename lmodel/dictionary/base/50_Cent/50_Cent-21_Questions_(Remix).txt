50 Cent
New York City, you are now ridin' with, with 50 Cent, you gotta love it
I just wanna chill and twist a lot
Catch sunshine in my 745
You drive me crazy, shorty I 
Need to see you and feel you next to me
I'll provide everything you need and I
Like your smile, I don't wanna see you cry
Got some questions that I gotta ask and I
Hope you can come up with the answers babe
Nate Dogg
Girl, its easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out
Would you still, have love for me?
Girl, its easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still, have love for me?
50 Cent
If I fell off tomorrow, would you still love me?
If I didn't smell so good, would you still hug me?
If I got locked up and sentenced to a quarter century
Could I count on you to be there to support me mentally?
If I went back to a Hoop-D from a Benz
Would you poof and disappear, like some of my friends?
If I was hit and I was hurt would you be by my side?
If it was time to put in work would you be down to ride?
I get out and peel a nigga cap you chill and drive
I'm asking questions to find out how you feel inside
If I ain't rap 'cause I flip burgers in Burger King
Would you be ashamed to tell your friends you're feeling me?
In the bed, if I use my tongue would you like that?
If I wrote you a love letter, would you write back?
Now we can have a little drink, you know a nightcap
And we can go do what you like, I know you like that
Nate Dogg
Girl, its easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still, have love for me?
Girl, its easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still, have love for me?
50 Cent
Now would you leave me if you father found out I was thugging?
Do you believe me when I tell you, you the one I'm loving
Are you mad 'cause I'm asking you 21 questions?
Are you my soulmate? 'Cause if so, girl you're a blessing
Do you trust me enough, to tell me your dreams?
I'm staring at you tryna figure how you got in them jeans
If I was down would you say things to make me smile?
I treat you how you want to be treated, just teach me how
If I was with some other chick and someone happened to see
And when you asked me about it I said "It wasn't me"
Would you believe me?
Or up and leave me?
How deep is our bond?
If that's all it takes for you to be gone
We only humans girl we make mistakes
To make it up I do whatever it take
I love you like a fat kid love cake
You know my style
I'll say anything to make you smile
Nate Dogg
Girl, its easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still, have love for me?
Girl, its easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still, have love for me?
Could you love me in a Bentley?
Could you love me on a bus?
I'll ask 21 questions and they all about us
Could you love me in a Bentley?
Could you love me on a bus?
I'll ask 21 questions and they all about us
Monica
Boy, the reason I love you now
it won't change if you was down and out.
I'd still have love for you.
Boy, the reason I love you now
it won't change if you was down and out.
I'd still have love for you.
Now if you fell off tomorrow I would catch and save.
And if you didn't smell good then I'd go and bathe you.
And if they locked you up for a century
I'd be there to support you mentally.
Now, if you still drove a hoop-d when you cruised through
I'd hop in the ride just like I used to.
And if someone hurt you I'd be right by your side
And when it's time to put in work I would ride.
Get out, kill a nigga while I chill and drive.
I tell you 'cause this is how I feel inside.
And if you ain't rap but flipped burgers at Burger King
I'd be puttin' salt and pepper on the onion rings.
Now, in the bed, use your tongue.  You know I like that.
If you wrote me a love letter then I'd write you back.
Now you have a little drink- a nightcap.
I do all the things you like I know you like that.
