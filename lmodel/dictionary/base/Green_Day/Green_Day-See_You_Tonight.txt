<song artist="Green_Day" title="See_You_Tonight">
Maybe I'll see you tonight
Maybe I'll see you tonight
Wherever the night takes you
Maybe you'll see me too
The colder it gets, you won't see me anymore
But there's still a chance I might walk to your door
Maybe the time is not right
I won't be seeing you tonight
Maybe I'll see you tonight
Maybe I'll see you tonight
