20-20-20-4 hours to go
i wanna be sedated
nothing to do, nowhere to go, oh
i wanna be sedated
just get me to the airport, put me on a plane
hurry,hurry,hurry before i go insane
i can't control my fingers, i can't control my brain
oh no, oh no, oh no
20-20-20-4 hours to go
i wanna be sedated
nothing to do, nowhere to go,oh
i wanna be sedated
just put me in a wheelchair, puy me on a plane
hurry hurry hurry before i go insane
i can't control my fingers, i can't control my brain
oh no oh no oh no
20-20-20-4 hours to go
i wanna be sedated
nothing to do, nowhere to go, oh
i wanna be sedated
just put me in a wheelchair, get me to the show
hurry hurry hurry before i cant let go
i can't control my fingers, i can't control my toes
oh no oh no oh no
ba-ba-baba, baba -ba-baba i wanna be sedated
ba-ba-baba, baba-ba-baba i wanna be sedated
ba-ba-baba, baba-ba-baba i wanna be sedated
ba-ba-baba, baba-ba-baba i wanna be sedated
