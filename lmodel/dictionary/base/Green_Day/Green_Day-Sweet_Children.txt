<song artist="Green_Day" title="Sweet_Children">
Sweet young girl, so soft and blonde
Does exactly what she's been warned
Intoxication's in her veins
Sweet young boy plays with her brain
Believing all his pain filled lies
Putting his hands onto her thighs
Her purity has now been ripped
He takes it away and then he says
Sweet children
Sweet children
Sweet children
We'll never win
Johnny Ray's running scared
As the end is drawing near
Running from the light of day
?Or maybe lie and celebrate?
The slightest urge goes from his hands
Follow me if you understand
He's got the trigger on his gun
Final sin and now he runs
Sweet children
Sweet children
Sweet children
We'll never win
Sweet children
Sweet children
Sweet children
We'll never win
