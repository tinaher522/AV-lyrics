<song artist="Green_Day" title="Fuck_Time">
I'll drop your laundry and slam the door
I don't want your love, so give me more
I'm a beggar but I don't want a dime
Ahhhhh!
Oh baby baby, it's fuck time
You know I really wanna make you mine
Oh baby baby, it's fuck time
There's nothing left to say, yeah
Take a look into my eyes
I wanna hold you till you're paralyzed
Wow
Oh Amanda Jones, your holy grace
I wanna choke you till you're blue in the face
Your dirty thoughts and a dirty mind
Ahhhhh!
Oh baby baby, it's fuck time
You know I really wanna make you mine
Oh baby baby, it's fuck time
There's nothing left to say, yeah
Take a look into my eyes
I wanna hold you till you re paralyzed
Ah, hahaha, yeah
Whoo
Take a look into my eyes
I wanna hold you till you're paralyzed
Take a look into my eyes
I wanna hold you till you're paralyzed
Ah ah, hahaha
