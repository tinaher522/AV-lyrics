<song artist="Green_Day" title="King_For_A_Day-Shout_(Live)">
Started at the age of four
My mother went to the grocery store
Went sneaking through her bedroom door to find something in a size four
Sugar and spice and everything nice wasn't made for only girls
GI Joe in panty hose is making room for the one and only
King for a day, princess by dawn
King for a day in a leather thong
King for a day, princess by dawn
Just wait 'til all the guys get a load of me
[insert concert city here]
My daddy threw me in therapy
He thinks I'm not a real man
Who put the drag in the drag queen
Don't knock it until you tried it on
Sugar and spice and everything nice wasn't made for only girls
GI Joe in panty hose is making room for the
EVERYBODY
King for a day, princess by dawn
King for a day in a leather thong
King for a day, princess by dawn
Just wait 'til all the guys get a load of me
ENGLAND! Get those hands up in the air
Sugar and spice and everything nice wasn't made for only girls
GI Joe in panty hose is making room for the one and only
King for a day, princess by dawn
King for a day, in a leather thong
King for a day, princess by dawn
King for a day, in a leather thong
King for a day, princess by dawn
King for a day, in a leather thong
King for a day, princess by dawn
Just wait 'til all the guys
Just wait 'til all the guys
Just wait 'til all the guys get a load of ME
