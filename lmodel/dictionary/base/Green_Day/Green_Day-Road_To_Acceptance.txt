<song artist="Green_Day" title="Road_To_Acceptance">
I always waste my time just wondering
What the next man thinks of me
I'll never do exactly what I want
And I'll sculpt my life for your acceptance
I always waste my time just wondering
What the next man thinks of me
I'll never do exactly what I want
And I'll sculpt my life for your acceptance
And I feel forgotten, feel like rotting
Do you feel the same, do you feel the same?
Adolescence just can't make sense
It's calling my name, it's calling my name
I take a look around at all the things I've found
I call it blind hatred
If you'd stop awhile, and maybe if you'd smile
You would realize that we're all the same
It's just like a brain
When it goes insane
We feel the same pain
All my life I've seemed to have this need
I think at times it even turns to greed
We all want to join this family
We'll even sacrifice a moral changing
But I feel forgotten, feel like rotting
Do you feel the same, do you feel the same?
Adolescence just can't make sense
It's calling my name, it's calling my name
I take a look around at all the things I've found
I call it blind hatred
If you'd stop awhile, and maybe if you'd smile
You would realize that we're all the same
It's just like a brain
When it goes insane
We feel the same pain
I take a look around at all the things I've found
I call it blind hatred
If you'd stop awhile, and maybe if you'd smile
You would realize that we're all the same
It's just like a brain
When it goes insane
We feel the same pain
