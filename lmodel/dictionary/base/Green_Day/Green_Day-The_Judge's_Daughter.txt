Princess in a schoolgirl's dream, may I please speak to you?
I'm having troubles with control and it's all because of you
Today I kept on falling down, I thought it was the street
And so I looked down at my shoes, they were on the wrong feet
And I find it hard to be myself, can you please explain?
And I do not think that it's my health, you're the one to blame
You're the one I wish I had and now my girlfriend's getting mad
I cannot call this sane, I cannot call this sane
Today as I was walking down, you bumped into me
You said "excuse me" and walked away as I dropped to my knees
I prayed to the being in the sky that my parents told me of
I asked about you but no reply, no clues about your love
And I find it hard to be myself, can you please explain?
And I do not think that it's my health, you're the one to blame
My girlfriend left me on the phone, I'm pathetically left here alone
I cannot call this sane, I cannot call this sane
Can we find away
So that you can stay?
I think I'm gonna pop
I find it hard to be myself, can you please explain?
And I do not think that it's my health, you're the one to blame
You're the one I wish I had and now my girlfriend's getting mad
I cannot call this sane, I cannot call this sane
Can we find away
So that you can stay?
I think I'm gonna pop
