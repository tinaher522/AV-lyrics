<song artist="Green_Day" title="Going_To_Pasalacqua">
Here we go again, infatuation touches me
Just when I thought that it would end
Oh, but then again, it seems much more than that
But I'm not sure exactly what you're thinking
Well, I toss and turn all night thinking of your ways of affection
But to find that it's not different at all
Well, I throw away my past mistakes and contemplate my future
That's when I say "what the hey?"
Would it last forever?
You and I together, hand and hand, we run away, far away
I'm in for nasty weather
But I'll take whatever you can give that comes my way, far away
Here we go again, infatuation touches me
Just when I thought that it would end
Oh, but then again, it seems much more than that
But I'm not sure exactly what you're thinking
Well, I toss and turn all night thinking of your ways of affection
But to find that it's not different at all
Well, I throw away my past mistakes and contemplate my future
That's when I say "what the hey?"
Would it last forever?
You and I together, hand and hand, we run away, far away
I'm in for nasty weather
But I'll take whatever you can give that comes my way, far away
Well, I toss and turn all night thinking of your ways of affection
But to find that it's not different at all
Well, I throw away my past mistakes and contemplate my future
That's when I say "what the hey?"
Would it last forever?
You and I together, hand and hand, we run away, far away
I'm in for nasty weather
But I'll take whatever you can give that comes my way, far away
