<song artist="Green_Day" title="Church_On_Sunday">
Today is the first day of the rest of our lives
Tomorrow is too late to pretend everything's alright now
I'm not getting any younger as long as you don't get any older
I'm not gonna state that yesterday never was
Bloodshot, deadbeat, lack of sleep
Making your mascara bleed
Tears down your face
Leaving traces of my mistakes
When I say if I promise to go to church on Sunday
Will you go with me on Friday night?
If you live with me, I'll die for you
And this compromise
I hereby solemnly swear to tell the whole truth
And nothing but the truth is what I'll ever hear from you now
Trust is a dirty word that comes from such a liar
But respect is something I will learn if you have faith
Bloodshot, deadbeat, lack of sleep
Making your mascara bleed
Tears down your face
Leaving traces of my mistakes
When I say if I promise to go to church on Sunday
Will you go with me on Friday night?
If you live with me, I'll die for you
And this compromise
If I promise to go to church on Sunday
Will you go with me on Friday night?
If you live with me, I'll die for you
And this compromise
If I promise to go to church on Sunday
Will you go with me on Friday night?
If you live with me, I'll die for you
And this compromise
If I promise to go to church on Sunday
Will you go with me on Friday night?
If you live with me, I'll die for you
And this compromise
And this compromise
It's a compromise
