<big>Part I: The Death of St. Jimmy</big>
My heart is beating from me, I am standing all alone
Please call me only if you are coming home
Waste another year flies by, waste a night or two
You taught me how to live...
In the streets of shame
Where you've lost your dreams in the rain
There's no signs of hope
The stems and seeds of the last of the dope
There's a glow of light
The St. Jimmy is the spark in the night
Bearing gifts and trust
A fixture in the city of lust
What the hell's your name?
What's your pleasure, what is your pain?
Do you dream too much?
Do you think what you need is a crutch?
In the crowd of pain
St. Jimmy comes without any shame
He says we're fucked up but we're not the same
And mom and dad are the ones you can blame
Jimmy died today
He blew his brains out into the bay
In the state of mind
It's my own private suicide
<big>Part II: East 12th Street</big>
Well, nobody cares, well, nobody cares
Does anyone care if nobody cares?
Well, nobody cares, well, nobody cares
Does anyone care if nobody cares?
Jesus filling out paperwork now
At the facility on East 12th Street
He's not listening to a word now
He's in his own world and he's daydreaming
He'd rather be doing something else now
Like cigarettes and coffee with the underbelly
He's life's on the line with anxiety now
She had enough and he had plenty
Somebody get me out of here
Anybody get me out of here
Somebody get me out of here
Get me the fuck right out of here
So far away, I don't want to stay
Get me out of here right now
I just wanna be free, is there a possibility?
Get me out of here right now
This life-like dream ain't for me
<big>Part III: Nobody Likes You</big>
I fell asleep while watching Spike TV
After ten cups of coffee and you're still not here
Dreaming of a song, but something went wrong
And you can't tell anyone 'cause no one's here
Left me here alone
And I should have stayed home
After ten cups of coffee, I'm thinking
Where'd you go?
Nobody likes you
Everyone left you (where'd you go?)
They're all out without you
Having fun (where'd you go?)
Everyone left you
Nobody likes you (where'd you go?)
They're all out without you
Having fun
Where'd you go?
<big>Part IV: Rock 'n Roll Girlfriend</big>
Jeez...
I got a rock and roll band
I got a rock and roll life
I got a rock and roll girlfriend
And another ex-wife
I got a rock and roll house
I got a rock and roll car
I play the shit out of the drums
And I can play the guitar
I got a kid in New York
I got a kid in the Bay
I haven't drank or smoked nothing in over twenty-two days
So get off of my case, off of my case, off of my case
<big>Part V: We're Coming Home Again</big>
Here they come marching down the street
Like in desperation, murmur of a heartbeat
Coming back from the edge of town
Underneath their feet
The time has come and it's going nowhere
Nobody ever said that life was fair now
Go-carts and guns are treasures they will bear
In the summer heat
The world is spinning around and around, out of control again
From the 7-11 to the fear of breaking down
So send my love a letterbomb and visit me in Hell
We're the ones going...
Home, we're coming home again
Home, we're coming home again
I started fucking running as soon as my feet touched ground
We're back in the barrio and to you and me that's Jingletown
That's home, we're coming home again
Home, we're coming home again
Home, we're coming home again
Home, we're coming home again
Home, we're coming home again
Home, we're coming home again
Home, we're coming home again
Home, we're coming home again
Nobody likes you
Everyone left you
They're all out without you
Having fun
