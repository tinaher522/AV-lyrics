<song artist="Green_Day" title="Nuclear_Family">
Gonna ride the world like a merry-go-round
Like a ferris wheel, like it's breaking down
Drinking angel's piss, gonna crash and burn
I just want some action, so gimme my turn
Like a Chinese drama and conspiracy
It's the death of a nuclear family staring up at you
It's looking like another bad comedy
Just as long as it comes in high fidelity for me too
Can you hear the sound coming over the hill?
Gotta move my feet, it's coming in for the kill
Ba-baby, baby, it's a blow out
Like a nuclear bomb and it won't be long till I detonate
Like a Chinese drama and conspiracy
It's the death of a nuclear family staring up at you
It's looking like another bad comedy
Just as long as it comes in hi fidelity for me too, wow
Gonna ride the world like a merry-go-round
LIke a ferris wheel, like it's breaking down
Screaming, screaming, screaming bloody murder
Like a nuclear bomb, it won't be long till I detonate
Like a Chinese drama and conspiracy
It's the death of a nuclear family staring up at you
It's looking like another bad comedy
Just as long as it comes in high fidelity for me too
I say ten, nine, eight, seven
Six, five, four, three
5-4-3-2-1
