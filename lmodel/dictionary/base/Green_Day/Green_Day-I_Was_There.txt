<song artist="Green_Day" title="I_Was_There">
Looking back upon my life and the places that I've been
The pictures, faces, girls I've loved, I try to remember when
Faded memories on the wall, some names I have forgotten
But each one is a memory I look back on so often
I looked into the past and I want to make it last
I was there, I was there
I looked into the past and I want to make it last
I was there, I was there
Looking back, what I have done, there's lots more left to live
At times I feel overwhelmed, I question what I can give
But I don't let it get me down or cause me too much sorrow
There's no doubt about who I am, I always have tomorrow
I looked into the past and I want to make it last
I was there, I was there
I looked into the past and I want to make it last
I was there, I was there
Looking back upon my life
Faded memories upon the wall
Looking now at who I am, who am I?
I don't let it get me down
Looking back upon my life and the places that I've been
The pictures, faces, girls I've loved, I try to remember when
But I don't let it get me down or cause me too much sorrow
There's no doubt about who I am, I always have tomorrow
I looked into the past and I want to make it last
I was there, I was there
I looked into the past and I want to make it last
I was there, I was there
