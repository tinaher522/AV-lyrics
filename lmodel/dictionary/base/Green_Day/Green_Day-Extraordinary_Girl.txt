<song artist="Green_Day" title="Extraordinary_Girl">
She's an extraordinary girl in an ordinary world
And she can't seem to get away
He lacks the courage in his mind, like a child left behind
Like a pet left in the rain
She's all alone again
Wiping the tears from her eyes
Some days she feels like dying
She gets so sick of crying
She sees a mirror of herself, an image she wants to sell
To anyone willing to buy
He steals the image in her kiss from her heart's apocalypse
From the one called Whatsername
She's all alone again
Wiping the tears from her eyes
Some days he feels like dying
She gets so sick of crying
She's all alone again
Wiping the tears from her eyes
Some days he feels like dying, some days it's not worth trying
Now that they both are finding she gets so sick of crying
She's an extraordinary girl
An extraordinary girl
An extraordinary girl
An extraordinary girl
