<song artist="Green_Day" title="King_For_A_Day">
Started at the age of four
My mother went to the grocery store
Went sneaking through her bedroom door
To find something in a size four
Sugar and spice and everything nice
Wasn't meant for only girls
G.I. Joe in pantyhose
Is making room for the one and only
King for a day, princess by dawn
King for a day in the leather thong
King for a day, princess by dawn
Just wait 'til all the guys get a load of me
My daddy threw me in therapy
He thinks I'm not a real man
Who put the drag in the drag queen
Don't knock it until you've tried it
Sugar and spice and everything nice
Wasn't meant for only girls
G.I. Joe in pantyhose
Is making room for the one and only
King for a day, princess by dawn
King for a day in the leather thong
King for a day, princess by dawn
Just wait 'til all the guys get a load of me
Sugar and spice and everything nice
Wasn't meant for only girls
G.I. Joe in pantyhose
Is making room for the one and only
King for a day, princess by dawn
King for a day in the leather thong
King for a day, princess by dawn
King for a day in the leather thong
King for a day, princess by dawn
King for a day in the leather thong
King for a day, princess by dawn
Just wait 'til all the guys, just wait 'til all the guys
Just wait 'til all the guys get a load of me
