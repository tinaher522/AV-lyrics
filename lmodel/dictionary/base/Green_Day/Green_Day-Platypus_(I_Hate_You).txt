<song artist="Green_Day" title="Platypus_(I_Hate_You)">
You rise and fall
Back up against the wall
What goes around is coming back and haunting you
It's time to quit
'Cause you ain't worth the shit
Under my shoes or the piss on the ground
No one loves you and you know it
Don't pretend that you enjoy it or you don't care
'Cause now I wouldn't lie
Or tell you all the things you want to hear 
'Cause I hate you!
'Cause I hate you!
'Cause I hate you!
'Cause I hate you!
I heard you're sick
Sucked on that cancer stick
A throbbing tumor and a radiation high
Shit out of luck
And now your time is up
It brings me pleasure just to know you're gonna die
No one loves you and you know it
Don't pretend that you enjoy it or you don't care
'Cause now I wouldn't lie
Or tell you all the things you want to hear 
'Cause I hate you!
'Cause I hate you!
'Cause I hate you!
'Cause I hate you!
Dickhead, fuckface
Cock-smoking, motherfucking asshole
Dirty twat, waste of semen, I hope you die, hey!
Red eye, code blue
I'd like to strangle you
And watch your eyes bulge right out of your skull
When you go down
Head first into the ground
I'll stand above you just to piss on your grave
No one loves you and you know it
Don't pretend that you enjoy it or you don't care
'Cause now I wouldn't lie
Or tell you all the things you want to hear 
'Cause I hate you!
'Cause I hate you!
'Cause I hate you!
'Cause I hate you!
