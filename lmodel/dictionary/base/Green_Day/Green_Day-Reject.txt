<song artist="Green_Day" title="Reject">
Who the hell are you to tell me
What I am and what's my master plan?
What makes you think that it includes you?
Self-righteous wealth, stop flattering yourself
So when the smoke clears, here I am
Your reject all-American
Sucking up your social sect, making you a nervous wreck
To hell and back and hell again, I've gone
You're not my type
Not my type
What's the difference between you and me?
I do what I want and you do what you're told
So listen up, shut the hell up
It's no big deal, and I'll see you in hell
So when the smoke clears, here I am
Your reject all-American
Sucking up your social sect, making you a nervous wreck
To hell and back and hell again, I've gone
You're not my type
Not my type
Not my type
You're not my type
So when the smoke clears, here I am
Your reject all-American
Falling from grace right on my face
To hell and back and hell again, I've gone
