<song artist="Green_Day" title="Armatage_Shanks">
Stranded... lost inside myself
My own worst friend
My own closest enemy
Branded... maladjusted
Never trusted anyone
Let alone myself
I must insist
On being a pessimist
I'm a loner in a catastrophic mind
Elected the rejected
I perfected the science of the idiot
No meaning... no healing
Self loathing freak and introverted
Deviot
I must insist
On being a pessimist
I'm a loner in a catastrophic mind
Stranded... lost inside myself
My own worst friend
My own closest enemy
Elected the rejected
I perfected the science of the idiot
I must insist
On being a pessimist
I'm a loner in a catastrophic mind
I'm getting pissed
I'm a worthless pessimist
I'm a loner in a claustrophobic mind
