<song artist="Green_Day" title="Kill_The_DJ">
Wow!
Ooh
Walking after dark
In the New York City park
Your thoughts are so unholy in the holiest of holes
Onward Christian soldiers filled with jive and mind control
The blood left on the dance floor, running, running red
The bullet that you asked for, killing you to death, unless you
Someone kill the DJ, shoot the fucking DJ
Someone kill the DJ, shoot the fucking DJ
Someone kill the DJ, shoot the fucking DJ
Voices in my head are saying, "Shoot that fucker down."
We are the vultures, the dirtiest kind
The culture war's in your heart and your mind
Ooh
Walking after dark
In the New York City park
Ooh, beer goggles left in the club, a pocket full of pills
Sodom and Gomorrah in the century of thrills
The blood left on the dance floor, running, running red
The bullet that you asked for, killing you to death, unless you
Someone kill the DJ, shoot the fucking DJ
Someone kill the DJ, shoot the fucking DJ
Someone kill the DJ, shoot the fucking DJ
Hold him underwater till that motherfucker drowns
We are the vultures, the dirtiest kind
The culture war's in your heart and your mind
Ooh
(Someone's gonna get you, boy)
Shoot that fucker down
Someone kill the DJ, shoot the fucking DJ
Someone kill the DJ, shoot the fucking DJ
(Walking after dark) Someone kill the DJ, shoot the fucking DJ
(Walking after dark) Someone kill the DJ, shoot the fucking DJ
(Walking after dark) Someone kill the DJ, shoot that fucker down (Wow!)
Someone kill the DJ, shoot the fucking DJ
Someone kill the DJ, shoot the fucking DJ
Someone kill the DJ, shoot the fucking DJ
Voices in my head are saying, "Shoot that fucker down."
