<song artist="Green_Day" title="DUI">
Let's get drunk and go out driving
Let's see just how quickly we can go
Let's get plowed and plow down some old lady
Let's go drink off the stereo
Let's go down and vomit out the window
Let's keep score of how many we've killed
Two tequila slammers off the dashboard
There's an alcoholic at the wheel
Careful when I'm taking this next corner
Don't want anybody wasting beer
Pass another lime and Corona
Too drunk to use my clutch while shifting gears
Let's get drunk and go out driving
Let's do donuts in the cul-de-sac
Let's get drunk and go out driving
We're going and we're never coming back
We're going and we're never coming back
We're going and we're never coming back
