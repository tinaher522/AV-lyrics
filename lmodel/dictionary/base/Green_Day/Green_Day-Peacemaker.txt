<song artist="Green_Day" title="Peacemaker">
One two three four
Purr
Well, I’ve got a fever, a non-believer
I’m in a state of grace
For I am the Caesar, I’m gonna seize the day (Aah!)
Well, call of the banshee hey hey!
Hey hey hey hey hey!
As God is my witness, the infidels are gonna pay
Well, call the assassin, the orgasm
A spasm of love and hate
For what will divide us? The righteous and the meek (Aah!)
Well, call of the wild hey hey!
Hey hey hey hey hey!
Well, death to the girl at the end of the serenade
Vendetta, sweet vendetta
This Beretta of the night
This fire and the desire
Shots ringing out on a holy parasite
Well, I am a killjoy from Detroit
I drink from a well of rage
I feed off the weakness with all my love (Ahh!)
Well, call up the captain hey hey!
Hey hey hey hey hey!
Well, death to the lover that you were dreaming of
Well, this is a stand off, a Molotov
Cocktail's on the house
You thought I was a write off, you better think again (Aah!)
Well, call the peacemaker hey hey!
Hey hey hey hey hey!
I’m gonna send you back to the place where it all began
Vendetta, sweet vendetta
This Beretta of the night
This fire and the desire
Well, shots ringing out on a holy parasite
Well, now the caretaker’s the undertaker
So I’m gonna go out and get the peacemaker
This is the neo St. Valentine’s massacre (Ahh!)
Well call up the Gaza hey hey!
Hey hey hey hey hey!
Death to the ones at the end of the serenade
Well, death to the ones at the end of the serenade
Well, death to the ones at the end of the serenade
Well, death to the ones at the end of the serenade!
