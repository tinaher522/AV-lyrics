<song artist="Green_Day" title="Dry_Ice">
Late last night I had a dream and she was in it again
She and I were in the sky, flying hand in hand
I woke up in a cold sweat wishing she was by my side
Praying that she'll dry the tears left on my face I've cried
Oh, I love her
Keep dreaming of her
Will I understand
If she wants to be my friend?
I'll send a letter to that girl, asking her to be my own
But my pen is writing wrong so I'll sing it in a song
Oh, I love you more right now, more than I've ever loved before
Here's these words straight from these lips, I'll need you forever more
Oh, I love her
Keep dreaming of her
Will I understand
If she wants to be my friend?
Oh, I love her
Keep dreaming of her
Will I understand
If she wants to be my friend?
Come ease the pain that's in my heart
Come ease the pain that's in my heart
Come ease the pain that's in my heart
Come ease the pain that's in my heart
Late last night I had a dream and she was in it again
She and I were in the sky, flying hand in hand
I woke up in a cold sweat wishing she was by my side
Praying that she'll dry the tears left on my face I've cried
Oh, I love her
Keep dreaming of her
Will I understand
If she wants to be my friend?
Oh, I love her
Keep dreaming of her
Will I understand
If she wants to be my friend?
Come ease the pain that's in my heart
Come ease the pain that's in my heart
Come ease the pain that's in my heart
Come ease the pain that's in my heart
