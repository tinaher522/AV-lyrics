<song artist="Green_Day" title="Troublemaker">
Yeah
Woohoo
Hey
You're giving me a heart attack
You're giving me a cardiac arrest
When I'm sitting at the traffic light
Hey
I wanna get inside of you
I wanna crack your cranium
Delirium on the lower east side of your mind
I wanna be a troublemaker
I wanna be a troublemaker
I wanna be a troublemaker
I wanna be a troublemaker
Hey
I like your BMW
I like your BM excellent tits
With a tattoo of a pig sniffing glue
Hey
You're living at the W
You're looking like a Jezebel, hot as hell
Sunburnt in a pink bathing suit
I wanna be a troublemaker
I wanna be a troublemaker
I wanna be a troublemaker
I wanna be a troublemaker
Hey
Woohoo
Woohoo
Woohoo
Yeah
Easy cum and go, gonna go it alone
Knock yourself out with a shot of Patr√≥n
I wouldn't say I'm straight
'Cause I'm bent out of shape
From now till death do we party
Just before it's too late
Hey
You're giving me a heart attack
You're giving me a cardiac arrest
When I'm sitting at the traffic light
Hey (woohoo)
Hey (woohoo)
Hey (woohoo)
Hey (woohoo)
