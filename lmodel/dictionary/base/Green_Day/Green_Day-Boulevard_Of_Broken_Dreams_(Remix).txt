<song artist="Green_Day" title="Boulevard_Of_Broken_Dreams_(Remix)">
I walk a lonely road
The only one that I have ever known
Don't know where it goes
But its home to me and I walk alone
Today is gonna be the day
That they're gonna throw it back to you
I walk this empty street
On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
When the city sleeps
And I'm the only one and I walk alone
By now you should've somehow
Realised what you gotta do
I walk alone, I walk alone
I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do (I walk alone, I walk alone)
About you now
My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
'Til then I walk alone
Backbeat the word was on the street
That the fire in your heart is out
I'm sure you've heard it all before
But you never really had a doubt
I don't believe that anybody feels
The way I do about you now
I'm walking down the line
That divides me somewhere in my mind
On the border line
Of the edge and where I walk alone
Today is gonna be the day
That they're gonna throw it back to you
Read between the lines
What's fucked up and everything's alright
Check my vital signs
And know I'm still alive and I walk alone
Today is gonna be the day
That they're gonna throw it back to you
I walk alone, I walk alone
By now you should've somehow
Realised what you gotta do
And all the roads we have to walk are winding
And all the lights that lead us there are blinding
There are many things that I would
Like to say to you
But I don't know how
I walk this empty street
On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
Today is gonna be the day
That they're gonna throw it back to you
I walk this empty street
On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
By now you should've somehow
Realised what you gotta do
When the city sleeps
And I'm the only one and I walk a...
I said maybe
My shadow's only one that walks beside me (You're gonna be the one that saves me)
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating (You're gonna be the one that saves me)
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me (You're gonna be the one that saves me)
'Til then I walk alone
