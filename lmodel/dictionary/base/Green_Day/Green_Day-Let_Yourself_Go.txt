<song artist="Green_Day" title="Let_Yourself_Go">
Shut your mouth 'cause you're talking too much
And I don't give a damn anyway
You always seem to be stepping in shit
And all you really do is complain
It's your lie, tell it how you like
Small minds tend to think alike
Shut your mouth 'cause you're talking too much
And I don't give a fuck anyway
Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go
Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go
Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go
Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go
Gotta let it go, gotta let it go!
Gotta let it go, gotta let it go!
Cut the crap 'cause you're screaming in my ear
And you're taking up all of the space
You're really testing my patience again
And I'd rather get punched in the face
You're getting on my very last nerve
Everything you've said I've already heard
I'm sick to death of your every last breath
(Shut the fuck up!) And I don't give a fuck anyway
Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go
Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go
Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go
Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go
Gotta let it go, gotta let it go!
Gotta let it go, gotta let it go!
Gotta let it go, gotta let it go!
Gotta let it go, gotta let it go!
Always fuck-fuckin' with my head now
Always fuck-fuckin' with my head now
Always fuck-fuckin' with my head now
Always fuckin' with my head and
I gotta let it go, let yourself go, let yourself go
Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go
Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go
Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go
Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go
Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go
Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go
Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go
