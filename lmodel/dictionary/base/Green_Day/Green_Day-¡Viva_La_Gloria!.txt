<song artist="Green_Day" title="¡Viva_La_Gloria!">
Hey Gloria, are you standing close to the edge?
Look out to the setting sun
Brink of your vision
Eternal youth is a landscape of a lie
The cracks of my skin can prove
As the years will testify
Say your prayers and light a fire
We're going to start a war
Your slogan's a gun for hire
It's what we waited for
Hey Gloria, this is why we're on the edge
The fight of our lives been drawn
To this undying love
Gloria, ¡Viva La Gloria!
You blast your name in graffiti on the walls
Falling through broken glass and slashing through your spirit
I can hear it like a jilted crowd
Gloria, where are you Gloria?
You found a home in all your scars and ammunition
You made your bed in salad days amongst the ruins
Ashes to ashes of our youth
She smashed her knuckles into winter (Gloria)
As autumn's wind fades into black
She is the saint of all the sinners (Gloria)
The one that's fallen through the cracks
So don't put away
Your burning light
Gloria, where are you Gloria?
Don't lose your faith to your lost naiveté
Weather the storm and don't look back on last November
When your banners were burning down
Gloria, ¡Viva La Gloria!
Send me your amnesty down to the broken-hearted
Bring us the season that we always will remember
Don't let the bonfires go out
So Gloria
Send out your message of
The light that shadows in the night
Gloria
Where's your undying love?
Tell me the story of your life
Your life
