Today's the Macy's Day Parade
The night of the living dead is on its way
With the credit report for duty call
It's a lifetime guarantee
Stuffed in a coffin, ten percent more free
Red light special at the mausoleum
Give me something that I need
Satisfaction guaranteed to you
What's the consolation prize?
Economy-sized dreams of hope
When I was a kid, I thought
I wanted all the things that I haven't got
Oh, but I learned the hardest way
Then I realized what it took
To tell the difference between thieves and crooks
A lesson learned to me and you
Give me something that I need
Satisfaction guaranteed
'Cause I'm thinking about a brand new hope, the one I've never known
'Cause now I know it's all that I wanted
What's the consolation prize?
Economy-sized dreams of hope
Give me something that I need
Satisfaction guaranteed
'Cause I'm thinking about a brand new hope, the one I've never known
And where it goes
And I'm thinking about the only road, the one I've never known
And where it goes
And I'm thinking about a brand new hope, the one I've never known
'Cause now I know it's all that I wanted
