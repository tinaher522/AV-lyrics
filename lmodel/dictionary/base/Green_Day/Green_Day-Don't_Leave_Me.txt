<song artist="Green_Day" title="Don't_Leave_Me">
I'll go for miles until I find you
You say you want to leave me but you can't choose
I've gone through pain every day and night
I feel my mind is going insane, something I can't fight
Don't leave me
Don't leave me
Don't leave me
Don't leave me
A blank expression covering your face
I'm looking for directions to get out of this place
I start to wonder if you'll come back
I feel the rain storming after thunder, I can't hold back
Don't leave me
Don't leave me
Don't leave me
Don't leave me
