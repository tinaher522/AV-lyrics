<song artist="Green_Day" title="1,000_Hours">
Starlit night, the moon is shining bright
You're the one I need
Up at your window, I see a shadow
Silhouette of your grace
Here's this flower I picked for all the hours
That you've spent with me
The one I love, that I've been dreaming of
Sailing across the sea
Let my hands flow through your hair
Moving closer, a kiss we'll share
Passionate love to be all night long
We'll never break, as one too strong
Nothing's more than what our love is for
As I kiss your cheek
Oh, so softly, hands flowing down my back
A thousand hours, I'll never leave
Our romance is a love trance
And now we'll never part
A thousand hours of such a love shower
We'll never stop once we start
Let my hands flow through your hair
Moving closer, a kiss we'll share
Passionate love to be all night long
We'll never break, as one too strong
Let my hands flow through your hair
Moving closer, a kiss we'll share
Passionate love to be all night long
We'll never break, as one too strong
