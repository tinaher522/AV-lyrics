<song artist="Green_Day" title="Worry_Rock">
Another sentimental argument and bitter love
Fucked without a kiss again, dragged it through the mud
Yelling at brick walls and punching windows made of stone
The worry rock has turned to dust and fallen on our pride
A knock-down, dragged-out fight
Fat lips and open wounds
Another wasted night
No one will take the fall
Where do we go from here
And what did you do with the directions?
Promise me no dead-end streets
And I'll guarantee we'll have the road
A knock-down, dragged-out fight
Fat lips and open wounds
Another wasted night
No one will take the fall
Another sentimental argument and bitter love
Fucked without a kiss again, dragged it through the mud
Where do we go from here and what did you do with the directions?
Promise me no dead-end streets and I'll guarantee we'll have the road
And I'll guarantee we'll have the road
And I'll guarantee we'll have the road
