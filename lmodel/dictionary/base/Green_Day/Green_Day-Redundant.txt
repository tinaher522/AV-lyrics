<song artist="Green_Day" title="Redundant">
We're living in repetition
Content in the same old shtick again
Now the routine's turning to contention
Like a production line going over and over and over, roller coaster
Now I cannot speak, I've lost my voice
Speechless and redundant
'Cause I love you's not enough
I'm lost for words
Choreographed and lack of passion
Prototypes of what we were
Went full circle 'til I'm nauseous
Taken for granted, now I've wasted, faked it, ate it, now I hate it
Now I cannot speak, I've lost my voice
Speechless and redundant
'Cause I love you's not enough
I'm lost for words
Now I cannot speak, I've lost my voice
Speechless and redundant
'Cause I love you's not enough
I'm lost for words
Now I cannot speak, I've lost my voice
Speechless and redundant
'Cause I love you's not enough
I'm lost for words
