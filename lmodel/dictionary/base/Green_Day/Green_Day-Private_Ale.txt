<song artist="Green_Day" title="Private_Ale">
I wander down these streets all by myself
Think of my future now, I just don't know
Or I don't seem to care
I stop to notice that I'm by your home
I wonder if you're sitting all alone
Or is your boyfriend there?
Because I feel so right
Let my imagination go
Until you're in my sights
And through my veins temptation flows
So I sit down here on the hard concrete
Think of my future now, I just don't know
Or I don't seem to care
I stop to notice that I'm by your home
I wonder if you're sitting all alone
Or is your boyfriend there?
Because I feel so right
Let my imagination go
Until you're in my sights
And through my veins temptation flows
Because I feel so right
Let my imagination go
Until you're in my sights
And through my veins temptation flows
