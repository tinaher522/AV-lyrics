<song artist="Green_Day" title="Desensitized">
Clenching my teeth tight, head is like a sponge
Give it to me free
I want to get ripped off and drown in the airwaves
Another fatal wreck on the information highway
So go ahead and kill yourselves, it all amuses me
For I'll be damned to spend my life in hell, another wise ingrate
Bring me blood and pain of a stranger's fate
Give it all away
I'm desensitized, I want to watch a bomb
Blow the masses high
I want to get ripped off and drown in the airwaves
Another fatal wreck on the information highway
So go ahead and kill yourselves, it all amuses me
For I'll be damned to spend my life in hell, another wise ingrate
Bring me blood and pain of a stranger's fate
Give it all away
I want to get ripped off and drown in the airwaves
Another fatal wreck on the information highway
So go ahead and kill yourselves, it all amuses me
For I'll be damned to spend my life in hell, another wise ingrate
