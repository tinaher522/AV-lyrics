<song artist="Green_Day" title="Wow!_That's_Loud">
Smell your Technicolor in your eyes
Makes me sick with pleasure in my mind
Shake it like it's so enlightening
Staring in the sun that's blinding
Like a bottle rocket in the sky
Dressed to the nines like a black cat's eyes
You're such a beautiful mess tonight
Wow, that dirty dress is so loud
Wow, that dirty dress is so loud
And it goes
Wearing a psychotic red alert
Your bouquet of flowers in the dirt
Radioactive and primal
Nuclear and so delightful
Wearing Day-Glo where you know it hurts
Dressed to the nines like a black cat's eyes
You're such a beautiful mess tonight
Wow, that dirty dress is so loud
Wow, that dirty dress is so loud
And it goes
Smell your Technicolor in your eyes
Makes me sick with pleasure in my mind
Shake it like it's so enlightening
Staring in the sun that's blinding
Like a bottle rocket in the sky
Dressed to the nines like a black cat's eyes
You're such a beautiful mess tonight
Wow, that dirty dress is so loud
Wow, that dirty dress is so loud
And it goes
