<song artist="Green_Day" title="Pulling_Teeth">
I'm all busted up, broken bones and nasty cuts
Accidents will happen, but this time I can't get up
She comes to check on me, making sure I'm on my knees
After all, she's the one who put me in this state
Is she ultra-violent, is she disturbed?
I better tell her that I love her
Before she does it all over again
Oh god, she's killing me
For now I'll lie around
Hell, that's all I can really do
She takes good care of me
Just keep saying my love is true
Is she ultra-violent, is she disturbed?
I better tell her that I love her
Before she does it all over again
Oh god, she's killing me
Looking out my window
For someone that's passing by
No one knows I'm locked in here
All I do is cry
For now I'll lie around
Hell, that's all I can really do
She takes good care of me
Just keep saying my love is true
