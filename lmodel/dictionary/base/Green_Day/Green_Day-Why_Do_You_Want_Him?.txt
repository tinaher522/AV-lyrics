<song artist="Green_Day" title="Why_Do_You_Want_Him?">
I saw you standing alone with a sad look on your face
You call him on the phone, looks like he left without a trace
Tears falling out of your eyes, he's living in a disguise
You're feeling bad for so long, you wonder if it's right or wrong
Why do you want him?
Why do you want him?
Now many days have gone by, you still just sit there and cry
You're feeling bad for yourself, his memory will always dwell
You're so obsessed with his love, that's why push came to shove
Been feeling bad for so long, you wonder if it's right or wrong
Why do you want him?
Why do you want him?
Why do you want him?
Why do you want him?
You find a way out
To throw it all the way
But you can bet
You got something to say
Why do you want him?
Why do you want him?
Why do you want him?
Why do you want him?
