<song artist="Green_Day" title="Bab's_Uvula_Who?">
I've got a knack for fucking everything up
My temper flies and I get myself all wound up
My fuse is short and my blood pressure is high
I lose control and I get myself all wound up
Tension mounts and I fly off the wall
I self destruct and I get myself all wound up
Petulance and irritation set in
I throw a tantrum and I get myself all wound up
I lose myself and I'm all wound up
Petulance and I'm all wound up
Loss of control and I'm all wound up
I lose myself and I'm all wound up
Chip on my shoulder and a leech on my back
Stuck in a rut and I get myself all wound up
Killed my composure and it'll never come back
Loss of control and I get myself all wound up
Blown out of proportion again
My temper snaps and I get myself all wound up
Spontaneous combustion panic attack
I slipped a gear and I get myself all wound up
Loss of myself and I'm all wound up
I'm off the handle and I'm all wound up
I lose myself and I'm all wound up
I lose myself and I'm all wound up
I've got a knack for fucking everything up
My temper flies and I get myself all wound up
My fuse is short and my blood pressure is high
I lose control and I get myself all wound up
Tension mounts and I fly off the wall
I'm in a rut and I get myself all wound up
Petulance and irritation sets in
I throw a tantrum and I get myself all wound up
I lose myself and I'm all wound up
Loss of control and I'm all wound up
Have an attack and I'm all wound up
I lose myself and I'm all wound up
