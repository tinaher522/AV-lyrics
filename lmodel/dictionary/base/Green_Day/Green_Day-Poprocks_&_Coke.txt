<song artist="Green_Day" title="Poprocks_&_Coke">
Wherever you go, you know I'll be there
If you go far, you know I'll be there
I'll go anywhere
So I'll see you there
You place the name, you know I'll be there
You name the time, you know I'll be there
I'll go anywhere
So I'll see you there
Well, I don't care if you don't mind
I'll be there not far behind
I will dare, keep in mind
I'll be there for you
When there's a truth, you know I'll be there
Amongst the lies, you know I'll be there
I'll go anywhere
So I'll see you there
Well, I don't care if you don't mind
I'll be there not far behind
I will dare, keep in mind
I'll be there for you
If you should fall, you know I'll be there
To catch the call, you know I'll be there
I'll go anywhere
So I'll see you there
Well, I don't care if you don't mind
I'll be there not far behind
I will dare, keep in mind
I don't care, I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you
