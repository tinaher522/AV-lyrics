<song artist="Green_Day" title="The_Forgotten">
Where in the world is the forgotten?
They're lost inside your memory
You're draggin' on, your heart's been broken
As we all go down in history
Where in the world did the time go?
It's where your spirit seems to roam
Like losing faith to our abandon
Or an empty hallway from a broken home
Well, don't look away
From the arms of a bad dream
Well, don't look away
Sometimes you're better lost than to be seen
I don't feel strange, it's more like haunted
Another moment trapped in time
I can't quite put my finger on it
But it's like a child that was left behind
So where in the world's the forgotten
Like soldiers from a long lost war
We share the scars from our abandon
And what we remember becomes folklore
Well, don't look away
From the arms of a bad dream
Well, don't look away
Sometimes you're better lost than to be seen
Don't look away from the arms of a moment
Don't look away from the arms of tomorrow
Don't look away from the arms of a moment
Don't look away from the arms of love
Don't look away
From the arms of a bad dream
Don't look away
Sometimes you're better lost than to be seen
Don't look away from the arms of a moment
Don't look away from the arms of tomorrow
Don't look away from the arms of a moment
Don't look away from the arms of love
