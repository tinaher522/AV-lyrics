<song artist="Green_Day" title="Rusty_James">
This whiskey sour
Amateur hour
Raise your glass and toast your friends
And someday we will fight again
Well your enemies
Your tragedies
Pocket knives and rusty chains
Where the hell is the old gang at?
And all the losers
Can't even win for losing
And the beginners
Don't even know what song they're singing
When there's no one left around
And you're the last gang in town
And your heart can't even break
When it doesn't even pound
When there's no one left around
And you're the last gang in town
And your heart can't even break
When it doesn't even pound, alright!
This broken scene
Is turning green
A brass knuckles left in the rain
Death-wish kids among the living
I wanna ride
On the divided
Anything but the mainstream
Where the fuck is your old gang man?
And all the losers
Can't even win for losing
And the beginners
Don't even know what song they're singing
When there's no one left around
And you're the last gang in town
And your heart can't even break
When it doesn't even pound
When there's no one left around
And you're the last gang in town
And your heart can't even break
When it doesn't even pound
So long
Didn't even say goodnight
So long
There's no where to go when you're hiding in plain sight
When there's no one left around
And you're the last gang in town
And your heart can't even break
When it doesn't even pound
When there's no one left around
And you're the last gang in town
And your heart can't even break
When it doesn't even pound
When there's no one left around
And you're the last gang in town
And your heart can't even break
When it doesn't even pound
When there's no one left around
And you're the last gang in town
And your heart can't even break
When it doesn't even pound
