<song artist="Green_Day" title="Maria">
She smashed the radio with the board of education
Turned up the static left of the state of the nation
Turn up the flame, step on the gas, burning the flag at half-mast
She's a rebel's forgotten son, an export of the revolution
She is the first voice of the last ones in the line
She'll drag the lake to keep the vendetta alive
Bring in the head of the government, the dog ate the document
Somebody shot the president and no one knows where Maria went
Maria
Maria
Maria
Where did you go?
Be careful what you're offering
Your breath lacks the conviction
Drawing the line in the dirt
Because the last decision was no
She smashed the radio with the board of education
Turned up the static left of the state of the nation
Turn up the flame, step on the gas, burning the flag at half-mast
She's a rebel's forgotten son, an export of the revolution
Maria
Maria
Maria
Where did you go?
Maria
Maria
Maria
Where did you go?
