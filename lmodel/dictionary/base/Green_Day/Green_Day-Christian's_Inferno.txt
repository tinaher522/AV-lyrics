<song artist="Green_Day" title="Christian's_Inferno">
I got under the grip between this modern hell
I got the rejection letter in the mail and it was already ripped to shreds
Seasons in ruin and this bitter pill is chasing blood
There’s fire in my veins and it’s pouring out like a flood
Whoa, Christian’s inferno
Whoa, Christian’s inferno
Whoa, Christian’s inferno
Whoa, Christian’s inferno
Hahahahahahahaha!
This diabolic state is gracing my existence 
Like a catastrophic baby, baby maybe you’re the chemical reaction
I am the atom bomb, I am the chosen one
Toxin your reservoir and then return man to ape
Whoa, Christian’s inferno
Whoa, Christian’s inferno
Whoa, Christian’s inferno
Whoa, Christian’s inferno
Hahahahahahahaha!
Whoa, Christian’s inferno
Whoa, Christian’s inferno
Whoa, Christian’s inferno
Whoa, Christian’s inferno
