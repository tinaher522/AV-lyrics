<song artist="Green_Day" title="American_Eulogy">
Mass Hysteria
Sing us the song of the century
That sings like American eulogy
The dawn of my love and conspiracy
Of forgotten hope and the class of '13
Tell me a story into that goodnight
Sing us a song for me
Hysteria
Mass hysteria
Mass hysteria
Mass hysteria
Red alert is the color of panic
Elevated to the point of static
Beating into the hearts of the fanatics
And the neighborhood's a loaded gun
Idle thoughts lead to full-throttle screaming
And the welfare's asphyxiating
Mass confusion is all the new rage
And it’s creating a feeding ground for the bottom feeders of
Hysteria
Mass hysteria
Mass hysteria
Mass hysteria
True sounds of maniacal laughter
And the deaf-mute is misleading the choir
The punch line is a natural disaster
And it’s sung by the unemployed
Fight fire with a riot
The class war is hanging on a wire
Because the martyr is a compulsive liar
When he said it’s just a bunch of niggers throwing gas into the
Hysteria
Mass hysteria
Mass hysteria
Mass hysteria
There’s a disturbance on the Oceanside
They tapped into the reserve
The static response is so unclear now
Mayday this is not a test!
As the neighborhood burns
America is falling
Vigilantes warning you
Calling Christian and Gloria!
Modern World
I don’t want to live in the modern world
I don’t want to live in the modern world
I don’t want to live in the modern world
I don’t want to live in the modern world!
I’m the class of '13 in the era of dissent
A hostage of the soul on a strike to pay the rent
The last of the rebels without a common ground
I’m gonna light a fire into the underground
Well, I don’t want to live in the modern world
I don’t want to live in the modern world
I don’t want to live in the modern world
I don’t want to live in the modern world!
I am a nation without bureaucratic ties
Deny the allegation as it’s written
Fucking lies!
Well I want to take a ride to the great divide
Beyond the “up to date” and the neo-gentrified
The high definition for the low resident
Where the value of your mind is not held in contempt
I can hear the sound of a beating heart
That bleeds beyond a system that is falling apart
With money to burn on a minimum wage
Well I don’t give a shit about the modern age!
I don’t want to live in the modern world
I don’t want to live in the modern world
I don’t want to live in the modern world
I don’t want to live in the modern world!
Mass hysteria
I don’t want to live in the modern world
Mass hysteria
I don’t want to live in the modern world
Mass hysteria
I don’t want to live in the modern world
Mass hysteria
I don’t want to live in the modern world!
Mass hysteria
I don’t want to live in the modern world
Mass hysteria
I don’t want to live in the modern world
Mass hysteria
I don’t want to live in the modern world
Mass hysteria
I don’t want to live in the modern world!
Mass hysteria
I don’t want to live in the modern world
Mass hysteria
I don’t want to live in the modern world!
