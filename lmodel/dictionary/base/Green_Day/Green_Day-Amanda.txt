<song artist="Green_Day" title="Amanda">
Amanda, don't you know
That I still walk around
This foggy roundabout
When I get back in town
I was a different man
From five seconds ago
And you're a different woman that's for certain
I don't know a thing about
Is this a kind of love
That only hate would understand
Amanda, I couldn't be your man
Amanda, don't you know
I wasn't strong enough
And in your wild mind
I wasn't smart enough
I was a different kid
From fifteen years ago
And you're a different woman that's for certain
I wanna know about
Is this some kinda love
That only hate would understand
Amanda, I couldn't be your man
I'm not playing with your mind
Unless you think I am
'Cause you were crushing my heart
Like a battering ram
Is this some kinda love
That only hate would understand
Amanda, I couldn't be your man
