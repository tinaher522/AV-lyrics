Ashley, are you running around?
Are you crying out in bloody murder?
Ashley, are you bumming around?
You're crying on my cold shoulder
You used to dangle my heart with your puppet strings
You dangled your desires right in front of my face
You led me to the well but wouldn't let me drink
Swallowing my pride and I never even got the taste
But time comes around and I'm not so naïve
I've finally lost touch 'cause you're so out of reach
You say that you're fine but I know that you ain't
You're looking like hell and you're no fucking saint
Ashley, are you running around
Are you crying out in bloody murder?
Ashley, are you bumming around?
You're crying on my cold shoulder
Ashley, are you running around?
Are you crying out in bloody murder?
Ashley, are you bumming around?
You're crying on my cold shoulder now
You are where you are
A wish on a shooting star
You are a filthy thought in my memory
I taste the cigarettes and liquor on your breath
We used to call it speed but now it's crystal meth
Back then I loved you but you're scaring me to death
This careless memory and now I could care less
But time comes around and I'm not so naïve
I've finally lost touch 'cause you're so out of reach
You say that you're fine but I know that you ain't
You're looking like hell and you're no fucking saint
Ashley, are you running around?
Are you crying out in bloody murder?
Ashley, are you bumming around?
You're crying on my cold shoulder now
Ashley, are you running around?
Are you crying out in bloody murder?
Ashley, are you bumming around?
You're crying on my cold shoulder now
Ashley
