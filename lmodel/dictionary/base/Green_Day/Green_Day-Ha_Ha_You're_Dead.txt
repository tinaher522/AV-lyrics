<song artist="Green_Day" title="Ha_Ha_You're_Dead">
How do you get your sleep at night?
How did you get your noose so tight?
Like chewing on tinfoil, it's so much fun
Gonna be dead before you're gone
'Cause look how things have gotten
And I'll be happy so I won't pretend
And I'll be cheering as you're going down
And I'll be laughing, I'll be laughing
How many feelings can you steal?
Gotta be part of your appeal
I can see through you 'cause you're wearing thin
Like chewing on tinfoil once again
'Cause look how things have gotten
And I'll be happy so I won't pretend
And I'll be cheering as you're going down
And I'll be laughing
Ha ha, you're dead
And I'm so happy
In loving memory
Of your demise
When your ship is going down
I'll go out and paint the town
Ha ha, you're dead, ha ha, you're dead, ha ha, you're dead
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha, you're dead
And I'm so happy
In loving memory
Of your demise
When your ship is going down
I'll go out and paint the town
Ha ha, you're dead, ha ha, you're dead, ha ha, you're dead
Ha ha, you're dead
The joke is over
You were an asshole
And now you're gone
As your ship is going down
I'll stand by and watch you drown
Ha ha, you're dead, ha ha, you're dead, ha ha, you're dead
Ha ha, you're dead, you're gonna be dead
Just remember what I said
Ha ha, you're dead, ha ha, you're dead, ha ha, you're dead
