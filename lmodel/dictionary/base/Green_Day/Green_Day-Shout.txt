<song artist="Green_Day" title="Shout">
Now wait a minute (yeah yeah...yeah)
I want you to know
I want you to know now
You've been so good
Even better than myself
You been so good to me (x3)
You know you make me wanna shout
Pick my hands up and shout (x4)
(Hey-Hey-A-Hey) (x4)
A little bit softer now (x12)
(Shooby-doo-wop-bop-bop) (x 4)
Always look on the bright side of life (x4)
(Hey-Hey-A-Hey) (x4)
A little bit louder now (x12)
Jump up and shout now (x4)
(Hey-Hey-A-Hey) (x4)
