<song artist="Green_Day" title="One_Of_My_Lies_(Live)(_)">
Don't smoke the brown weed!
Uh, this is off one of our records that no one has.
When I was younger I thought the world circled around me
 But in time I realized I was wrong
 My immortal thoughts turned into just dreams of a dead future
 It was a tragic case of my reality
 Do you think you're indestructible
 And no one can touch you
 Well I think you're disposable
 And it's time you knew the truth...
 'Cause it's just one of my lies!
 Well, it's just one of my lies
 And all I wanted to was get real high
 Well, it's just one of my lies
 Why does my life have to be so small?
 Yet death is forever
 And does forever have a life to call its own?
 Don't give me an answer 'cause you
 Only know as much as I know
 Unless you're been there once
 Well I hardly think so
 Do you think you're indestructible
 And no one can touch you
 Well I think you're disposable
 And it's time you knew the truth...
 'Cause it's just one of my lies!
 Well, it's just one of my lies
 And all I wanted to was get real high
 Well, it's just one of my lies
 I used to pray all night
 Before I lay myself down
 My mother said it was right
 Her mother said it too...
 Why?
