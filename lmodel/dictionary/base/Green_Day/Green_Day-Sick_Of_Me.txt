<song artist="Green_Day" title="Sick_Of_Me">
Why can't you just admit, you've had it?
You're sick of me
You're fed up with all my bad habits
You're sick of me
Telling lies, you've become so desensitized
Sick of me
Lost regrets, I can see that you've had a few
Sick of me
Wandering out the door
I am onto you
You're coming back for more
Am I losing you?
Like a dog that just pissed on your barbecue
Sick of me
Losing faith and you still don't know what to do
Sick of me
Loss of love, now you hate everything
And you're sick of me
It's a waste but we still keep on trying
You're sick of me
Wandering out the door
I am onto you
You're coming back for more
Am I losing you?
So you got your problems
So did I at your age
Do you have a conscience?
Do you have a reason, I'm sick of you too
Wandering out the door
I am onto you
You're coming back for more
Am I losing you?
