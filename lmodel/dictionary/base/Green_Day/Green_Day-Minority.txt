<song artist="Green_Day" title="Minority">
I want to be the minority
I don't need your authority
Down with the moral majority
'Cause I want to be the minority
I pledge allegiance to the underworld
One nation under dog, there of which I stand alone
A face in the crowd, unsung, against the mold
Without a doubt, singled out, the only way I know 
'Cause I want to be the minority
I don't need your authority
Down with the moral majority
'Cause I want to be the minority
Stepped out of the line
Like a sheep runs from the herd
Marching out of time to my own beat now
The only way I know
One light, one mind, flashing in the dark
Blinded by the silence of a thousand broken hearts
"For crying out loud," she screamed unto me
A free for all, fuck 'em all, you are your own side
'Cause I want to be the minority
I don't need your authority
Down with the moral majority
'Cause I want to be the minority, hey!
One light, one mind, flashing in the dark
Blinded by the silence of a thousand broken hearts
"For crying out loud," she screamed unto me
A free for all, fuck 'em all, you are your own side
'Cause I want to be the minority
I don't need your authority
Down with the moral majority
'Cause I want to be the minority
(I want to be the minority) The minority
(I want to be the minority) The minority
(I want to be the minority) The minority
(I want to be the minority) The minority
