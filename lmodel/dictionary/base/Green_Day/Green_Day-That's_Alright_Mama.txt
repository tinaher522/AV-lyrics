<song artist="Green_Day" title="That's_Alright_Mama">
Well, that's all right mama
That's all right for you
That's all right now mama
That's all right
That's all right
That's all right now mama
Any way you do
Well mama she done told me
Papa done told me too
Son that gal you're foolin' with
She ain't no good for you, but
That's all right
That's all right
That's all right now mama
Any way you do
I'm leavin' town my baby
I'm leavin' town for sure
Well then you won't be bothered
With me hangin' 'round your door
But that's all right
That's all right now mama
Any way you do
De de de de,
De de de de
De de de de
I need your lovin'
That's all right
That's all right now mama
Any way you do
