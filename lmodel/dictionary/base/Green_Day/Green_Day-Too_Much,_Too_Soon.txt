<song artist="Green_Day" title="Too_Much,_Too_Soon">
She's always living like she's running out of time
Too much just ain't enough to keep her satisfied
Her plastic heart is filled with nothing comes to mind
It's now her occupation that she's overqualified
The looks are always so deceiving
The truth is always misconstrued to you
Too much too soon, too little and now you're coming unglued
Too much too soon, too late and now it sucks to be you
Too much too soon, too little and now you're coming unglued
Too much too soon, too late and now it sucks to be you too
He's talking shit about how it's better way back when
He lives every waking moment as means to an end
We are, we are, but I'm not, I never used to be
So god bless your fucking past and to hell with your glory
The looks are always so deceiving
The truth is always misconstrued to you
Too much too soon, too little and now you're coming unglued
Too much too soon, too late and now it sucks to be you
Too much too soon, too little and now you're coming unglued
Too much too soon, too late and now it sucks to be you too
Too bad, too bad this is goodbye
And bon voyage
Farewell, see you in hell
I hope you rest in pieces
Fuck you!
Too much too soon, too little and now you're coming unglued
Too much too soon, too late and now it sucks to be you
Too much too soon, too little and now you're coming unglued
Too much too soon, too late and now it sucks to be you too
