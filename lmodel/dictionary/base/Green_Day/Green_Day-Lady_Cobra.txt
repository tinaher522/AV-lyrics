<song artist="Green_Day" title="Lady_Cobra">
Well I met a girl named Lady Cobra
Her black heart beats crimson and clover
She gives me chills and fever blisters
She's serving spells and voodoo shakes
Well, she just wants to get me high
Stick a needle in my eye
Reeks like hell lost in temptation
Rubbing on my inner demons
I don't wanna suicide, I don't want this to end
I just want to be your friend 
Cuddle up with me real tight
Talk to me by candlelight
Do you wanna play a game of Twister?
Like a dirty old man with a babysitter
I don't wanna suicide, I don't want this to end
I just want to be your friend
Well, I don't want to make you cry
Cross my heart and hope to die
Drawing blood and lonely stars
Drinking piss for cheap guitars
I don't wanna suicide, I don't want this to end
I just want to be your friend
Oh, your friend
