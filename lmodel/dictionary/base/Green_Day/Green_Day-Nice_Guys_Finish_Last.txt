<song artist="Green_Day" title="Nice_Guys_Finish_Last">
Nice guys finish last, you're running out of gas
Your sympathy will get you left behind
Sometimes you're at your best when you feel the worst
You feel washed up like piss going down the drain
Pressure cooker, bake my brain and tell me I'm insane
I'm so fucking happy I could cry
Every joke can have its truth, but now the joke's on you
I never knew you're such a funny guy
Oh, nice guys finish last
When you run out of gas
Don't pat yourself on the back
You might break your spine
Living on command, you're shaking lots of hands
You're kissing up and bleeding all your trust
Take in what you need, bite the hand that feeds
You'll lose your memory and you got no shame
Pressure cooker, bake my brain and tell me I'm insane
I'm so fucking happy I could cry
Every joke can have its truth, but now the joke's on you
I never knew you're such a funny guy
Oh, nice guys finish last
When you run out of gas
Don't pat yourself on the back
You might break your spine
Oh, nice guys finish last
When you run out of gas
Don't pat yourself on the back
You might break your spine
Oh, nice guys finish last
When you run out of gas
Don't pat yourself on the back
You might break your spine
Oh, nice guys finish last
When you run out of gas
Don't pat yourself on the back
You might break your spine
