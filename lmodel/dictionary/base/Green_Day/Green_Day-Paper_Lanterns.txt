<song artist="Green_Day" title="Paper_Lanterns">
Now I rest my head from such an endless dreary time
A time of hopes and happiness that had you on my mind
Those days are gone and now it seems as if I'll get some rest
But now and then, I'll see you again and it puts my heart to test
So when are all my troubles gonna end?
I'm understanding now that we are only friends
To this day I'm asking why I still think about you
As the days go on, I wonder will this ever end?
I find it hard to keep control when you're with your boyfriend
I do not mind if all I am is just a friend to you
All I want to know right now is if you think about me too
So when are all my troubles gonna end?
I'm understanding now that we are only friends
To this day I'm asking why I still think about you
So when are all my troubles gonna end?
I'm understanding now that we are only friends
To this day I'm asking why I still think about you
