<song artist="Green_Day" title="Favorite_Son">
He hit the ground running at the speed of light
His star is brightly shining like a neon light
It's your favorite son
It's your favorite son
A fixture on the talk shows to the silver screen
From here to Colorado, he's a sex machine
It's your favorite son
It's your favorite son
But isn't it a drag, isn't it a drag?
Isn't it a drag?
It's pretty but it's sad
Isn't it a drag?
A clean-cut all-American really ain't so clean
His royal auditorium is a murder scene
It's your favorite son
It's your favorite son
Oh, isn't it a drag, isn't it a drag?
Isn't it a drag?
It's pretty but it's sad
Oh, isn't it a drag?
Well, no one says it's fair
Turn a teenage lush to a millionaire
Now where's your fucking champion, on a bed you laid?
He's not the all-American that you thought you'd be
It's your favorite son
It's your favorite son, but isn't it a drag?
