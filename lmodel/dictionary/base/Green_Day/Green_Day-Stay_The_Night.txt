<song artist="Green_Day" title="Stay_The_Night">
Well I ain't got much time so I'll get to the point
Do you wanna share a ride and get the fuck out of this joint?
I've got an impulse so repulsive that it burns
I wanna break your heart until it makes your stomach turn
I gotta know if you're the one that got away
Even though it was never meant to be
Say you'll stay the night
'Cause we're running out of time
So stay the night
I don't wanna say goodbye
Say you'll stay the night
'Cause we're running out of time
So stay the night
I don't wanna say goodbye
You're so sick and tired of feeling so alone
Well, I don't understand the point if you have to go home
So won't you stay and count the circles 'round my eyes?
And we can watch the stars until the sun begins to rise
I gotta know if you're the one that got away
Even though it was never meant to be
Say you'll stay the night
'Cause we're running out of time
So stay the night
I don't wanna say goodbye
Say you'll stay the night
'Cause we're running out of time
So stay the night
I don't wanna say goodbye
Hey oh!
I gotta know if you're the one that got away
Even though it was never meant to be
Say you'll stay the night
'Cause we're running out of time
So stay the night
I don't wanna say goodbye
Say you'll stay the night
'Cause we're running out of time
So stay the night
I don't wanna say goodbye
