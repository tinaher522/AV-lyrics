<song artist="Green_Day" title="Suffocate">
Three AM, I'm drunk again
My head is spinning underneath my puke
So make it stop, I'm getting off
Make it stop, I'm getting off
Sedatives and dizzy spells
And spilling my guts out onto my feet
So make it stop, I'm getting off
Make it stop, I'm getting off
Well, slipped into a coma once again
Where's my organ donor to lend a hand?
So when you think you're all alone
No one's left to come around
Drop like flies and empathize
And I know that I will someday
And I know that I will suffocate
Suffocate
Suffocate
Suffocate
One night stands and cheap regrets
I take another drag off of my cigarette
So stop, I'm getting off
Make it stop, I'm getting off
One last stop for a one-track mind
Just give me shelter, give me, give me something
Make it stop, I'm getting off
Make it stop, I'm getting off
Well, slipped into a coma once again
Where's my organ donor to lend a hand?
So when you think you're all alone
No one's left to come around
Drop like flies and empathize
And I know that I will someday
And I know that I will suffocate
Suffocate
Suffocate
Suffocate
So when you think you're all alone
No one's left to come around
Drop like flies and empathize
And I know that I will someday
And I know that I will suffocate
Suffocate
Suffocate
Suffocate
