<song artist="Green_Day" title="On_The_Wagon">
Sometimes it gets real hard and I need some kind of output
For an input twice the size of my one-inch mind
So slap me on the hand, put it right back down my pants
Turn me right around, kick me in the ass
Well, today I say sweet things, but tomorrow
I'll be making up excuses for my actions 'cause it's been so long
Since I have been in love, that special kind of feeling
It's my best excuse, I'm on the wagon again
Well, today I say sweet things, but tomorrow
I'll be making up excuses for my actions 'cause it's been so long
Since I have been in love, that special kind of feeling
It's my best excuse, I'm on the wagon again
Well, I got no real excuse, I'm on the wagon again
