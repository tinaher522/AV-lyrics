<song artist="Green_Day" title="American_Idiot_(Live)">
Don't wanna be an American Idiot
Don't want a nation under the new media
And can you hear the sound of hysteria?
The subliminal mind fuck America
Alright!
Welcome to a new kind of tension
All across the alien nation
Everything isn't meant to be okay
Television dreams of tomorrow
We're not the ones who're meant to follow
Well that's enough to argue
England!
Well maybe I'm the fuck head America
I'm not a part of a Redneck Agenda (alright)
Now everybody do the Propaganda
And sing along in the Age of Paranoia
Alright!
Welcome to a new kind of tension
All across the alien nation
Everything isn't meant to be okay
Television dreams of tomorrow
We're not the ones who're meant to follow
Well that's enough to argue
C'mon!
Alright England!
I say hey oh!
Let's sing Hey Oh!
Hey Hey
Hey Hey...
Alright!
Are you guys ready to sing along?
I want you to sing so loud
That every f&amp;*king Redneck in America
Hears you tonight alright!
Don't wanna be an American Idiot
One nation controlled by the media
Information nation of hysteria
It's going out to idiot America
Welcome to a new kind of tension
All across the alienation
Everything isn't meant to be okay
Television dreams of tomorrow
We're not the ones who're meant to follow
