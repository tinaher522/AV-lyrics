<song artist="Green_Day" title="Strangeland">
Looking out through clouds in the sky
Floating image in my mind
Land of beauty and land of grace
Now I wonder where this place is from
The average person is everywhere
I got a job and now I'm scared
Strange beings all around
Come everyone to this place I've found
Evidence is everywhere
I start to run, now I'm scared
Strange beings all around.
Everyone come to this place I've found
I feel what its like to be wanted
And wonder why
Unlocked doors will be open
No more cries
My eyes are clear and now I'm cured
Don't you want to be for sure
I know my rights, I'm allowed to die
So I'd rather swap your different guise
It's in my head that you will find
Mother love from all mankind
You look above and then you shout
No other way to say your head is right
I feel what its like to be wanted
And wonder why
Unlocked doors will be open
No more cries
I feel what its like to be wanted
And wonder why
Unlocked doors will be open
No more cries
