<song artist="Green_Day" title="Do_Da_Da">
Every time I'm falling down
You take the repercussions
Headaches and anxiety
Advancing my frustrations
Rushing through my depression
Sacrifice everything
Waste with me into nothing
Well, now you're stuck with me, stuck with me, stuck with me
Handcuff your soul to my wrist
And I'll vow my trust to you
Moving on, I always said
I realize you've imagined
Rushing through my depression
Sacrifice everything
Waste with me into nothing
Well, now you're stuck with me, stuck with me, stuck with me
Rushing through my depression
Sacrifice everything
Waste with me into nothing
Well, now you're stuck with me, stuck with me, stuck with me
