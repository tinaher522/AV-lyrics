<song artist="Green_Day" title="Santa_Claus_Is_Coming_To_Town">
You better watch out,
You better not cry,
You better not pout
And Im telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town
Hes making his list, checking it twice
Gonna find out if youre naughty or nice
Santa Claus is coming to town
He sees you when youre sleeping
He knows when youve been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
O, You better watch out,
You better not cry,
You better not pout
And Im telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town
O, You better watch out,
You better cry,
You better not pout,
And Im telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town
Hes making his list, checking it twice
Gonna find out if youre naughty or nice
Santa Claus is coming to town
He sees you when youre sleeping
He knows when youve been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Santa Claus is coming, to, TOWWWWWWWWN
