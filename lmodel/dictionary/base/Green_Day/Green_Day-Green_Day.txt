<song artist="Green_Day" title="Green_Day">
A small cloud has fallen, the white mist hits the ground
My lungs comfort me with joy
Vegging on one detail, the rest just crowds around
My eyes itch of burning red
Picture sounds
Of moving insects, so surreal
Lay around
Looks like I found something new
Laying in my bed, I think I'm in left field
I picture someone, I think it's you
You're standing so damn close my body begins to swell
Why does one and one make two?
Picture sounds
Of moving insects, so surreal
Lay around
Looks like I found something new
Laying in my bed, I think I'm in left field
I picture someone, I think it's you
You're standing so damn close my body begins to swell
Why does one and one make two?
Picture sounds
Of moving insects, so surreal
Lay around
Looks like I found something new
