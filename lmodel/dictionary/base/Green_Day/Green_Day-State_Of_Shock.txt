<song artist="Green_Day" title="State_Of_Shock">
I'm going in to a state of shock
I can twist, I can hardly walk
And I'm holding on for life
Should I be concerned?
My eyes are rolling in the back of my head
I'm black and blue and I'm in the red
And the silence is so loud
Should I be concerned?
We want to go to heaven
But no one wants to die
Defy your judgement and demons
And say your last goodbye
My tears are putting out my cigarette
And I'm singing out the alphabet
The way I remember
Should I be concerned?
Making plans for my amnesia
I'm going under anesthesia
I'm holding on for life
Should I be concerned?
We want to go to heaven
But no one wants to die
Defy your judgement and demons
And say your last goodbye
We want to go to heaven
But no one wants to die
We want to go to heaven
But no one wants to die
We want to go to heaven
But no one wants to die
Defy your judgement and demons
And say your last goodbye
