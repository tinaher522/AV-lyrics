<song artist="Green_Day" title="Take_Back">
You pushed me once too far again, I'd like to break your fucking teeth
And stick a knife in the center of your back
You better grow some eyes in the back of your head, I fight dirty just like your looks
Can't take, can't take, can't take anymore
So take back
Take back
Take
The taste of bad blood on the tip of my tongue, an eye for an eye, a gun for a gun
Cold-cocked, I'm taking back what's mine
Expect it when you're least expecting it, no loss of love, the smell of regret
Lights out, I can't take anymore
So take back
Take back
Take back
Take back
