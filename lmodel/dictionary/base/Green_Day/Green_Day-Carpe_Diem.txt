<song artist="Green_Day" title="Carpe_Diem">
Breaking in a sweat, like a bomb threat
Is your silhouette fading out?
Nothing left to lose, detonate the fuse
Another break in this blow out
Ain't it beautiful, so unusual?
Life's a gas and it's running out
Living a clich√©, gonna seize the day
Bottle rockets and celebrate, celebrate, celebrate
"Carpe Diem", a battle cry
Aren't we all too young to die?
Ask a reason and no reply
Aren't we all too young to die?
Making a living, making a killing
What's worth forgiving? 
Alright
A blink of an eye, barely scraping by
Dominated by passerbys
Feeling out of luck when the traffic's stuck
And you're feeling so left behind
Getting off a binge, get a second wind
Another promise to make a change
Got a broken wing, hear the angels sing
When the signal is out of range
Ain't it strange? Ain't it strange?
"Carpe Diem", a battle cry
Aren't we all too young to die?
Ask a reason and no reply
Aren't we all too young to die?
Making a living, making a killing
What's worth forgiving? 
Alright
Making a living, making a killing
What's worth forgiving?
Alright
"Carpe Diem", a battle cry
Aren't we all too young to die?
Ask a reason and no reply
Aren't we all too young to die?
"Carpe Diem", a battle cry
Aren't we all too young to die?
Ask a reason and no reply
Aren't we all too young to die?
