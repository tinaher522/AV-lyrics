<song artist="Green_Day" title="One_Of_My_Lies">
When I was younger I thought that the world circled around me
But in time, I realized I was so wrong
My immortal thoughts turned into just dreams of a dead future
It was a tragic case of my reality
Do you think you're indestructible
And no one can touch you?
Well, I think you're disposable
And it's time you knew the truth
'Cause it's just one of my lies
Well, it's just one of my lies
And all I want to do is get real high
Well, it's just one of my lies
Why does my life have to be so small, and death is forever
And does forever have a life to call its own?
Don't give me an answer 'cause you only know as much as I know
Unless you're been there once, hell, I hardly think so
Do you think you're indestructible
And no one can touch you?
Well, I think you're disposable
And it's time you knew the truth
'Cause it's just one of my lies
Well, it's just one of my lies
And all I wanna do is get real high
Well, it's just one of my lies
I used to pray at night
Before I lay myself down
My mother said it was right
Her mother set it down - why?
