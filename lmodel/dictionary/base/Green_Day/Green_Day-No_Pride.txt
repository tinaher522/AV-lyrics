<song artist="Green_Day" title="No_Pride">
Well, I'm just a mutt
And nowhere is my home
Where dignity's a landmine in the school of lost hope
I've panhandled for life
'Cause I'm not afraid to beg
Hand me down your lost-and-founds of second-hand regret
You'd better swallow your pride
Or you're gonna choke on it
You'd better digest your values
'Cause they turn to shit
Honor's gonna knock you down
Before your chance to stand up and fight
Well, I know I'm not the one, I got no pride
Sects of disconnection
And traditions of lost faith
No culture's worth a stream of piss or a bullet in my face
To hell with unity
Separation will kill us all
Torn to shreds and disjointed before the final fall
You'd better swallow your pride
Or you're gonna choke on it
You'd better digest your values
'Cause they turn to shit
Honor's gonna knock you down
Before your chance to stand up and fight
Well, I know I'm not the one, I got no pride
You'd better swallow your pride
Or you're gonna choke on it
You'd better digest your values
'Cause they turn to shit
Honor's gonna knock you down
Before your chance to stand up and fight
Well, I know I'm not the one, I got no pride
I got no pride
Close your eyes and die
I got no pride
