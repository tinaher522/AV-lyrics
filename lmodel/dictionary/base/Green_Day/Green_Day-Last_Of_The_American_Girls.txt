<song artist="Green_Day" title="Last_Of_The_American_Girls">
She puts her makeup on
Like graffiti on the walls of the heartland
She's got her little book of conspiracies
Right in her hand
She is paranoid like
Endangered species headed into extinction
She is one of a kind
Well, she's the last of the American girls
She wears her overcoat
For the coming of the nuclear winter
She is riding her bike
Like a fugitive of critical mass
She's on a hunger strike
For the ones who won't make it for dinner
She makes enough to survive
For a holiday of working class
She's a runaway
Of the establishment incorporated
She won't cooperate
Well, she's the last of the American girls
She plays her vinyl records
Singing songs on the eve of destruction
She's a sucker for
All the criminals breaking the laws
She will come in first
For the end of Western civilization
She's an endless war
She's a hero for the lost cause
Like a hurricane
In the heart of the devastation
She's a natural disaster
She's the last of the American girls
She puts her makeup on
Like graffiti on the walls of the heartland
She's got her little book
Of conspiracies right in her hand
She will come in first
For the end of Western civilization
She's a natural disaster
She's the last of the American girls
Oh yeah, all right
Oh yeah
