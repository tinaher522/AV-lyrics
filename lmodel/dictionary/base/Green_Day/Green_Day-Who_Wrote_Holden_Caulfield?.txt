A thought burst in my head and I need to tell you
It's news that I forethought
Was it just a dream that happened long ago?
I think I just forgot
Well, it hasn't been the first time
And it sure does drive me mad
That's when I say there's a boy who fogs his world and now he's getting lazy
There's no motivation and frustration makes him crazy
He makes a plan to take a stand but always ends up sitting
Someone help him up or he is gonna end up quitting
I shuffle through my mind to see if I can find
The words I left behind
Was it just a dream that happened long ago?
Oh well, never mind
Well, it hasn't been the first time
And it sure does drive me mad
That's when I say there's a boy who fogs his world and now he's getting lazy
There's no motivation and frustration makes him crazy
He makes a plan to take a stand but always ends up sitting
Someone help him up or he is gonna end up quitting
That's when I say there's a boy who fogs his world and now he's getting lazy
There's no motivation and frustration makes him crazy
He makes a plan to take a stand but always ends up sitting
Someone help him up or he is gonna end up quitting
There's a boy who fogs his world and now he's getting lazy
There's no motivation and frustration makes him crazy
He makes a plan to take a stand but always ends up sitting
Someone help him up or he is gonna end up quitting
