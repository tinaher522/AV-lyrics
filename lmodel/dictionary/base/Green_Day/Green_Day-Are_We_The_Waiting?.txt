<song artist="Green_Day" title="Are_We_The_Waiting?">
Starry nights
City lights
Coming down over me
Skyscrapers
Stargazers in my head
Are we? We are 
Are we? We are the waiting unknown
This dirty town 
Was burning down in my dreams
Lost and found 
City bound in my dreams
And screaming
Are we? We are
Are we? We are the waiting
And screaming
Are we? We are
Are we? We are the waiting
Forget-me-nots
Second thoughts
Live in isolation
Heads or tails
Fairytales in my mind
Are we? We are
Are we? We are the waiting unknown
The rage and love
The story of my life
The Jesus of Suburbia is a lie
And screaming
Are we? We are
Are we? We are the waiting
And screaming 
Are we? We are
Are we? We are the waiting unknown
Are we? We are
Are we? We are the waiting
And screaming
Are we? We are
Are we? We are the waiting unknown
Are we? We are
Are we? We are the waiting unknown
