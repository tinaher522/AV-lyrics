<song artist="Green_Day" title="Baby_Eyes">
Go go go
Year of the rat, last of the litter
Somebody shot the babysitter
They say my middle name is Danger
The kind you keep away from strangers
I say whoa, I'm out of control
Well baby, when I see your pretty face
I say whoa, God rest your fucking soul
'Cause baby baby, I was born to kill
I pulled the trigger for the shooting stars
I am the motor in your crashing car
I am the cherub in the Arab Spring
I am the bullet in your magazine
I say whoa, I'm out of control
Well baby, when I see your pretty face
I say whoa, God rest your fucking soul
'Cause baby, baby eyes
Baby eyes
Baby baby, I was born to kill
