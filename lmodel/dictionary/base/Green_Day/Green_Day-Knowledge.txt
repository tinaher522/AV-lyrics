<song artist="Green_Day" title="Knowledge">
I know things are getting tougher
When you can't get the top off the bottom of the barrel
Wide-open road of my future now
Is looking fucking narrow
All I know is that I don't know
All I know is that I don't know nothing
All I know is that I don't know
All I know is that I don't know nothing
We get taught to decide
Just like, as if
I'm not gonna change my mind
All I know is that I don't know
All I know is that I don't know nothing
All I know is that I don't know
All I know is that I don't know nothing
Whatcha gonna do with yourself?
Boy, you better make up your mind
Whatcha gonna do with yourself?
You're running out of time
All I know is that I don't know
All I know is that I don't know nothing
All I know is that I don't know
All I know is that I don't know nothing
All I know is that I don't know
All I know is that I don't know nothing
All I know is that I don't know
All I know is that I don't know nothing
And that's fine
