<song artist="Green_Day" title="I_Saw_My_Parents_Kissing_Santa_Claus">
I saw daddy kissing Santa Claus
Underneath the mistletoe
Last night
He didn't see me creep
down the stairs to have a peek
(Mike screams "Oh GOD!")
He thought I was up in the bedroom fast asleep
Then, I saw mommy kissing Santa Claus
Underneath the Christmas tree last night
there must be some mistake
was I really awake?
I move in closer, but better look away
(Mike and Billie make barfing noises)
