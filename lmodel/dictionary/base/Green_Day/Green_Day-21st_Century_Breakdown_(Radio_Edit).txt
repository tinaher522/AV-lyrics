Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome aboard the starship Green Day for our first passenger century breakdown.
Ready for count-down: 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 - ignition - lift off
21st century breakdown
Way out there in space
21st century breakdown
Our new fav'rite place
21st century breakdown
All systems are go
21st century breakdown
The sky is aglow
We are the class of the class of '13
Born in the era of humility
We are the desperate in the decline
Raised by the bastards of 1969
Ladies and Gentlemen, we've had a successful take-off on this first 21st century breakdown.
Our flying time will be eight hours. We'll be travelling at a speed of 2183 miles per second.
I am a nation, a worker of pride
My debt to the status quo
The scars on my hands and a means to an end
Is all that I have to show (21st century breakdown)
I swallowed my pride and I choked on my faith
I've given my heart and my soul
I've broken my fingers and lied through my teeth
The pillar of damage control (21st century breakdown)
I've been to the edge and I've thrown the bouquet
Of flowers left over the grave
I sat in the waiting room, wasting my time
And waiting for Judgement Day
I praise liberty
The "freedom to obey"
Is the song that strangles me
Oh, don't cross the line
Oh dream, America dream
I can't even sleep
From the light's early dawn
Oh scream, America scream
Believe what you see
From heroes and cons
Captain - unidentified object at 8 o'clock - 2 million miles away.
Stand by for emergency manoeuvre.
Object coming closer at the speed of light - we have eight more seconds.
Change course by four point six degrees.
Order executed.
Ladies and Gentlemen, in a few minutes we are going to be landing on breakdown, push the button on your left side, the safety mechanism will do the rest for you.
We hope you enjoyed the world's first 21st century breakdown, have a good time there.
