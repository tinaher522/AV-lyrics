<song artist="Green_Day" title="Walk_Away">
This time
I gotta put my guard down
Pick myself up off the ground
Take the pain
It'll pass
The swelling never really lasts
But the scar remains
Reminds me that I'm still living
Well, it's not too late
And it's really not worth the fight
No one's right
Well, It's time to walk away
Walk away
Walk away
Walk away
Walk away
Well the bigger that you come
The harder you're gonna fall
Walk away
Walk away
Did you win
Or maybe did you lose?
Now you're gonna lick your wounds anyway
When it comes back to you
When you fall
You're gonna need a parachute
Or use a pair of shoes to go
And walk away
Well, it's not too late
And it's really not worth the fight
No one's right
Well, it's time to walk away
Walk away
Walk away
Walk away
Walk away
Well the bigger that you come
All the harder you're gonna fall
Walk away
Walk away
Walk away
Oh, walk away
Oh, walk away
Well the bigger that you come
The harder you're gonna fall
Walk away
Walk away
Walk away
Walk away
Walk away
