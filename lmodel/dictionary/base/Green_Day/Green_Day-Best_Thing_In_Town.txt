<song artist="Green_Day" title="Best_Thing_In_Town">
Come with me and let's go for a ride
Follow me out to the other side
As I sit around and watch you pout
'Cause I know that you're the
Best thing in town
Best thing around
Best thing in town
Best thing around
Running wild and always running free
Exploring things that I have never seen
Hearing colors and all I see are sounds
Now I know that you're the
Best thing in town
Best thing around
Best thing in town
Best thing around
I'm seeing faces of mysteries of the earth
I am not one with the aggressions of my birth
Or go to stance or hallucinations I can't find
A missing piece of the thought that's in my mind
Come with me and let's go for a ride
Follow me out to the other side
As I sit around and watch you pout
'Cause I know that you're the
Best thing in town
Best thing around
Best thing in town
Best thing around
Running wild and always running free
Exploring things that I have never seen
Hearing colors and all I see are sounds
Now I know that you're the
Best thing in town
Best thing around
Best thing in town
Best thing around
