<song artist="Green_Day" title="The_One_I_Want">
Sitting in my room last night, staring at the mirror
I couldn't find a reason why I couldn't be near her
'Cause you are the one that started to make me feel this way
And every night I'm thinking about those words you'd say
Pictures going through my mind when we're together
All these long and sleepless nights will I ever get better
'Cause you are the one that started to make me feel this way
And every night I'm thinking about those words you'd say
'Cause you are the one that I want
'Cause you are the one that I want
'Cause you are the one that I want
'Cause you are the one that I want
Now you know how I feel, this love is forever
You make my life seem so unreal, will I ever get better?
'Cause you are the one that started to make me feel this way
And every night I'm thinking about those words you'd say
'Cause you are the one that I want
'Cause you are the one that I want
'Cause you are the one that I want
'Cause you are the one that I want
'Cause you are the one that I want
'Cause you are the one that I want
'Cause you are the one that I want
'Cause you are the one that I want
