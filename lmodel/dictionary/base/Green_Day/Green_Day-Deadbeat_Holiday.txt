<song artist="Green_Day" title="Deadbeat_Holiday">
Wake up, the house is on fire
And the cat's caught in the dryer
Philosophy's a liar when your home is your headstone
Icon is the last chance for hope
When there's no such thing as heroes
Your faith lies in the ditch that you dug yourself in
Last chance to piss it all away
Nothing but hell to pay when the lights are going down
Oh, deadbeat holiday
Celebrate your own decay
There's a vacant sign that's hanging high on the noose over your home
Deadbeat holiday
Get on your knees and pray
There's a vacant sign that's hanging high, but at least you're not alone
Christmas lights in the middle of August
Grudges come back to haunt us
Your oldest allies are your long-lost enemies
Grounded in a duplex to find
That you're living on a landmine
Vacation hotspot is a cemetery drive
Last chance to piss it all away
Nothing but hell to pay when the lights are going down
Oh, deadbeat holiday
Celebrate your own decay
There's a vacant sign that's hanging high on the noose over your home
Deadbeat holiday
Get on your knees and pray
There's a vacant sign that's hanging high, but at least you're not alone
Holiday
Suicide
Last chance to piss it all away
Nothing but hell to pay when all you want to do
Is not to... give up (give up)
Deadbeat holiday
Celebrate your own decay
There's a vacant sign that's hanging high on the noose over your home
Deadbeat holiday
Get on your knees and pray
There's a vacant sign that's hanging high, but at least you're not alone
Oh, deadbeat holiday
Celebrate your own decay
There's a vacant sign that's hanging high, but at least you're not alone
Holiday
