<song artist="Green_Day" title="Scumbag">
You come around every now and then
Your clothes are different but you're still the same
Why else would you come here?
Scumbag on a mission
You're telling me that it's been a while
Shit-eating grin and a brand new life
Somebody let you come here
Scumbag with permission
Never thought I'd see the likes of you around this place
What's the special occasion, did you run out of friends?
Here you are coming around again
Now things are different but you still pretend
You've got a reason to come here
Scumbag with ambition
And now you're telling me that things have changed
And you'll be leaving in a couple days
You're gonna change the world someday
Scumbag with a vision
It must be nice to know you've got it all figured out
But from where I'm sitting it's the same thing again and again
Have you ever stopped to think before you opened up your mouth?
'Cause every time you do it's the same thing again and again
