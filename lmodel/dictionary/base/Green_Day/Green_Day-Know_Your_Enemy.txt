<song artist="Green_Day" title="Know_Your_Enemy">
Do you know the enemy?
Do you know your enemy?
Well, gotta know the enemy, roh-ay
Do you know the enemy?
Do you know your enemy?
Well, gotta know the enemy, roh-ay
Do you know the enemy?
Do you know your enemy?
Well, gotta know the enemy, roh-ay
Violence is an energy
Against the enemy
Well, violence is an energy, roh-ay
Bringing on the fury
The choir infantry
Revolt against the honor to obey (oh-ay, oh-ay)
Overthrow the effigy
The vast majority
While burning down the foreman of control (oh ay, oh ay)
Silence is an enemy
Against your urgency
So rally up the demons of your soul (oh ay, oh ay)
Do you know the enemy?
Do you know your enemy?
Well, gotta know the enemy, roh-ay
Do you know the enemy?
Do you know your enemy?
Well, gotta know the enemy, roh-ay
The insurgency will rise
When the blood's been sacrificed
Don't be blinded by the lies
In your eyes
Say!
Oh-ay, oh-ay
Oh-ay, oh-ay
Well, violence is an energy (oh-ay, oh-ay)
Well, from here to eternity (oh-ay, oh-ay)
Well, violence is an energy (oh-ay, oh-ay)
Well, silence is the enemy
So gimme, gimme revolution!
Do you know the enemy?
Do you know your enemy?
Well, gotta know the enemy, roh-ay
Do you know the enemy?
Do you know your enemy?
Well, gotta know the enemy, roh-ay
Do you know the enemy?
Do you know your enemy?
Well, gotta know the enemy, roh-ay
Overthrow the effigy
The vast majority
While burning down the foreman of control (oh-ay, oh-ay)
Silence is the enemy
Against your urgency
So rally up the demons of your soul (oh-ay, oh-ay)
