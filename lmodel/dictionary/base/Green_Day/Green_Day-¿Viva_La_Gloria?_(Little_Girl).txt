<song artist="Green_Day" title="Â¿Viva_La_Gloria?_(Little_Girl)">
Little girl, little girl, why are you crying?
Inside your restless soul, your heart is dying
Little one, little one, your soul is purging
Of love and razor blades, your blood is surging
Run away from the river to the street
And find yourself with your face in the gutter
You're a slave for the Salvation Army
There is no place like home
When you got no place to go
Little girl, little girl, your life is calling
The charlatans and saints of your abandon
Little one, little one, the sky is falling
Your lifeboat of deception is now sailing
In the wake (run away) all the way no rhyme or reason (oh...)
Your bloodshot eyes will show your heart of treason
Little girl, little girl, you dirty liar
You're just a junkie preaching to the choir
Run away, from the river to the street
And find yourself with your face in the gutter
You're a stray for the Salvation Army
There is no place like home
When you got no place to go
The traces of blood always follow you home
Like the mascara tears from your getaway (Gloria!)
You're walking with blisters and running with shears
So unholy
Sister of grace
(Ooh woo ooh ooh woo ooh)
(Ooh woo ooh woo ooh)
(Ooh woo ooh ooh woo ooh)
(Ooh woo ooh woo ooh)
(Ooh woo ooh ooh woo ooh)
(Ooh woo ooh woo ooh)
(Ooh woo ooh ooh woo ooh)
(Ooh woo ooh woo ooh)
Run away, from the river to the street
And find yourself with your face in the gutter
You're a stray for the Salvation Army
There is no place like home
