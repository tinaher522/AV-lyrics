<song artist="Green_Day" title="Missing_You">
Waking up, feeling naked
In my clothes inside a room that's vacant
Lost my nerve, it's unnerving
I know there is something I'm forgetting
I searched the moon, I lost my head
I even looked under the bed
I punched the walls, I hit the street
I'm pounding the pavement looking
I'm missing you
I'm missing you
You're not around and I'm a complete disaster
I'm missing you
Remember, it was the first time
I told you I loved you at the bus station
Don't forget, 'cause it's not over
I'm not lost, 'cause I'm just missing you
I searched the moon, I lost my head
I even looked under the bed
I punched the walls, I hit the street
I'm pounding the pavement looking
I'm missing you
I'm missing you
You're not around and I'm a complete disaster
I'm missing you, say hey
Well, she's my blood
Well, she's my soul
I get so lost out in the cold
Feel so far like this lone star
It gets so hard when I'm missing you
I'm missing you
I'm missing you
You're not around and I'm a fucking disaster
I'm missing you
