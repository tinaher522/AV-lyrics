<song artist="Green_Day" title="Words_I_Might_Have_Ate">
Now it seems I can't keep my mind of you
My brain drifts back to better days we've been through
Like sitting on blacktops of the school grounds
The love I bitched about, I finally found
But now it's gone
And I take the blame
But there's nothing I can do but take the pain
Why?
Now I dwell on what you remind me of
A sweet young girl who sacrificed her love
As for me, I am blind without a cause
And now I realize what I have lost
It was something real
That I could have had
Now I play the fool whose stable soul's gone bad
Why?
Tell me worlds of words I might have said
It's pumping pressure deep inside my head
Was it bad enough to be too late?
Just tell me the words I might have ate
The words I might have ate
The words I might have ate
But now it's gone
And I take the blame
But there's nothing I can do but take the pain
Why?
Why?
Why?
Why?
Oh, why?
Why?
Why?
