<song artist="Green_Day" title="I_Don't_Wanna_Fall_In_Love">
Don't want to have you hangin' around me like a leech
I think you're just a problem, so stay the hell away from me
Because I don't believe in you and I wanna sit here all my life alone
This may sound a little rough, don't wanna fall in love
Don't need security, I ain't no dog without a bone
Don't have no time for love, so stay the fuck away from me
Because I don't believe in you and I wanna sit here all my life alone
This may sound a little rough, don't wanna fall in love
This may sound a little rough, don't wanna fall in love
This may sound a little rough, don't wanna fall in love
This may sound a little fucked, don't wanna fall in love
