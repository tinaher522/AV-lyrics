<song artist="Green_Day" title="Angel_Blue">
Gonna build it up just to burn it down
You're a princess, I'm a fucking clown
Stop the presses 'cause I'm killing time
Won't you be my bloody valentine?
You're just a fucking kid and no one ever gives you a break
You want a señorita and now your heart is gonna break
You're angel blue
With teenage traces
Angel blue
With pretty faces
Stab my heart like a stick in the mud
Cut my chest just to see the blood
Now I'm singing out the alphabet
As the tears are putting out my cigarette
We'll hit the cemetery so we can see the holiday lights
Waking up the dead and everything will be alright
You're angel blue
With teenage traces
Angel blue
With pretty faces
Alright
Stuck in the middle of Heaven and Hell
Alright
Trying to find my better angels
Stab my heart like a stick in the mud
Cut my chest just to see the blood
Stop the presses cause I'm killing time
Won't you be my bloody valentine?
You're just a fucking kid and no one ever gives you a break
You want a señorita and now your heart is gonna break
You're angel blue
With teenage traces
Angel blue
With pretty faces
