<song artist="Green_Day" title="Rotting">
I'm rotting inside, my flesh turns to dust
Whisper "Are you dying?" in my ear
I'm so sick to death, tumors in my head
Whisper "Are you dying?" in my ear
Black rose of death
In my fist I clutch
Thorns shred my fingertips
And drips toxic blood
Kiss me one last time, wash off my sweat
Whisper "Are you dying?" in my ear
As my bones they rust, leave vows of trust
Whisper "Are you dying?" in my ear
Black rose of death
In my fist I clutch
Thorns shred my fingertips
And drips toxic blood
I'm rotting inside, my flesh turns to dust
Whisper "Are you dying?" in my ear
Kiss me one last time, wash off my sweat
Whisper "Are you dying?" in my ear
Whisper "Are you dying?" in my ear
