<song artist="Green_Day" title="Song_Of_The_Century">
Sing us a song of the century
That's louder than bombs and eternity
The era of static and contraband
That's leading us into the promised land
Tell us a story that's by candlelight
Waging a war and losing the fight
They're playing a song of the century
Panic and promise and prosperity
Tell me a story into that goodnight
Sing us a song for me
