<song artist="Green_Day" title="Sweet_16">
Bring me back to an hour ago
Time stands still as the years go by
Brown eyed girl that's throwing down
A bottle of Old English
Back in the warehouse
Old days are fine but are left so far behind
From California to Jane Street
The kids alright, alright as they'll ever be
'Cause you will always be my
Well you will always be my
You will always be my Sweet 16
Sleep on the floor on cardboard
Stab at my heart like a dart board
Browned-skinned girl
I had a dream about a long, long time now
From the midwest to the beach
Old days are fine but are left so far behind
From California to Jane Street
The kids alright, alright as they'll ever be
'Cause you will always be my
Well you will always be my
You will always be my Sweet 16
Old days are fine but are left so far behind
From California to Jane Street
The kids alright, alright as they'll ever be
'Cause you will always be my
Well you will always be my
You will always be my Sweet 16
