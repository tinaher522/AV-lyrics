<song artist="Green_Day" title="I_Want_To_Be_On_TV">
Want to be a pretty boy
Want to go on Solid Gold
Want to date a millionaire
Want to make people stare
I want to be on TV
Want people to know me
I want to be on TV
Started out in '64
Gonna be an omnivore
Want to make the people dance
Gonna take off my pants
I want to be on TV
Want people to know me
I want to be on TV
On a magazine
Gonna have some free cocaine
Want to wear my Calvin Kleins
Then the world will be all mine
I want to be on TV
Want people to know me
I want to be on TV
