<song artist="Green_Day" title="No_One_Knows">
Why should my fun have to end?
For me it's only the beginning
I see my friends begin to age
A short countdown to their end
Call me irresponsible, call me habitual
But when you think of me
Do you fill your head with schemes?
Better think again 'cause no one knows
I don't want to cause no harm
But sometimes my actions hurt
Is there something I should find
To make plans for forever?
Call me irresponsible, call me habitual
But when you think of me
Do you fill your head with schemes?
Better think again 'cause no one knows
Call me irresponsible, call me habitual
But when you think of me
Do you fill your head with schemes?
Better think again 'cause no one knows
Does it seem like all your memories fade?
You soak up knowledge to fill the space
And still my answer remains
I don't know
