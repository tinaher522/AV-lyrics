<song artist="Green_Day" title="Little_Boy_Named_Train">
Where did you come from? Where have you been?
Looks like you fell into the trash bin
I'm catchin' train, I'm crashin' a car
Back in for daylight, shooting for the stars
Like a lifelong daisy chain
Of my imagination
A rat inside a maze
I got no destination
'Cause I'm a little boy named Train
Ask me again, I'll tell you the same
Little boy named Train
Don't know where I come from
But I know where I have been, hey
Serious people are funny to me
Funny people seem so serious
I'm always lost and nothing will change
Give me directions and I'll get lost again
Like a lifelong daisy chain
Of my imagination
A rat inside a maze
I got no destination
'Cause I'm a little boy named Train
Ask me again, I'll tell you the same
Little boy named Train
Don't know where I come from
But I know where I have been, say
Like a lifelong daisy chain
Of my imagination
A rat inside a maze
I got no destination
'Cause I'm a little boy named Train
Ask me again, I'll tell you the same
Little boy named Train
I don't know where I come from
But I know where I have been
I said I don't know where I come from
But I know where I have been
