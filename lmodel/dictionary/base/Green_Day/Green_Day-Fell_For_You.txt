<song artist="Green_Day" title="Fell_For_You">
I woke up in a pool of sweat
First I thought that I pissed the bed
Haunted stories in the midnight hour
The kiss of death from the Eiffel Tower
And I went down like the speed of sound
You're out of sight but not out of mind
I had a dream that I kissed your lips
And it felt so true
Then I woke up as a nervous wreck
And I fell for you
I'll spend the night living in denial
Making paper planes just for a while
I'll crash in to you, I crash into you
'Cause you crash in my imagination too
Break a leg and you crush my heart
I'm a mess and you're a work of art
Count your blessings going zero to five
Steal a kiss and I took a dive
And I went down like the speed of sound
You're out of sight but not out of mind
I had a dream that I kissed your lips
And it felt so true
Then I woke up as a nervous wreck
And I fell for you
I'll spend the night living in denial
Making paper planes just for a while
I'll crash into you, I crash into you
'Cause you crash in my imagination
I had a dream that I kissed your lips
And it felt so true
Then I woke up as a nervous wreck
And I fell for you
And I fell for you
And I fell for you
