<song artist="Green_Day" title="In_The_End">
All brawn and no brains and all those nice things
Yeah, you finally got what you want
Someone to look good with and light your cigarette
Is this what you really want?
I figured out what you're all about
And I don't think I like what I see
So I hope I won't be there in the end
If you come around
How long will he last before he's a creep in the past
And you're alone once again?
Will you pop up again and be my special friend
'Til the end, and when will that be?
I figured out what you're all about
And I don't think I like what I see
So I hope I won't be there in the end
If you come around
I figured out what you're all about
And I don't think I like what I see
So I hope I won't be there in the end
If you come around
