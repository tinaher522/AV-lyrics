<song artist="Green_Day" title="16">
Every night I dream the same dream
Of getting older and older all the time
I ask you now, what does this mean?
Are all these problems just in my mind?
Things are easy when you're a child
But now these pressures are dropped on my head
The length I've gone are just long miles
Would they be shorter if I were dead?
Every time I look in my past
I always wish I was there
I wish my youth would forever last
Why are these times so unfair?
Look at my friends and see what they've done
Ask myself why they've had to change
I liked them better when they were young
Now all these times are rearranged
I look down and stand there and cry
Nothing will ever be the same
The sun is rising now, I ask why
The clouds are falling, here comes the rain
Every time I look in my past
I always wish I was there
I wish my youth would forever last
Why are these times so unfair?
Every night I dream the same dream
Of getting older and older all the time
I ask you now, what does this mean?
Are all these problems just in my mind?
Things are easy when you're a child
But now these pressures are dropped on my head
The length I've gone are just long miles
Would they be shorter if I were dead?
Every time I look in my past
I always wish I was there
I wish my youth would forever last
Why are these times so unfair?
