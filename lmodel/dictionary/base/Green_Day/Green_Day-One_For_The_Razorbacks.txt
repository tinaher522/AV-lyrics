Juliet's trying to find out what she wants, but she don't know
Experience has got her down
Well, look this direction, I know it's not perfection, it's just me
I want to bring you up again now
'Cause I'm losing what's left of my dignity
A small price to pay to see that you're happy
Forget all the disappointments you have faced
Open up your worried world and let me in
Juliet's crying, well, now she's realizing love can be
Filled with pain and distrust
I know I am crazy and a bit lazy
But I will try to bring you up again somehow
'Cause I'm losing what's left of my dignity
A small price to pay to see that you're happy
Forget all the disappointments you have faced
Open up your worried world and let me in
Juliet's crying, well, now she's realizing love can be
Filled with pain and distrust
I know I am crazy and a bit lazy
But I will try to bring you up again somehow
'Cause I'm losing what's left of my dignity
A small price to pay to see that you're happy
Forget all the disappointments you have faced
Open up your worried world and let me in
