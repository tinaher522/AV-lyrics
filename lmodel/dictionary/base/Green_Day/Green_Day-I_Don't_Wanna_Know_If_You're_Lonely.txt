[Originally by Husker Du]
I keep my distance but that distance is too far
It reassures me just to know that you're okay
But i don't want you to go on needing me this way
And I, don't wanna know if you are lonely
Don't wanna know if you are less than lonely
Don't wanna know if you are lonely
Don't wanna know, don't want to know
The day you left me left me feeling oh so bad
Still i'm not sure about all the doubts we had
From the beginning we both knew it wouldn't last
Decisions have been made, the die has been cast
And I,don't wanna know if you are lonely
Don't wanna know if you are less than lonely
Don't wanna know if you are lonely
Don't wanna know, don't want to know
DON'T WANNA KNOW
The phone is ringing and the clock says 4 am
If it's your friends, well i don't wanna hear from them
Please leave your number and a message at the tone
Or you can just go on and leave me here alone
And I, don't wanna know if you are lonely
Don't wanna know if you are less than lonely
Don't wanna know if you are lonely
Don't wanna know, don't want to know
