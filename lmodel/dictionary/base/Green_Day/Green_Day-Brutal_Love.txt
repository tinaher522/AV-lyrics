<song artist="Green_Day" title="Brutal_Love">
Turn out the lights, close your eyes
Turn up the silence, the heartache of your life
Dance forever under the lights
This brutal love
Oh, how you want it, you're begging for it
But you can't have it even if you tried
It's in the clutches, in my hands of
This brutal love
Old toys, this plastic heart
Loners and fools are tearing me apart
Here comes trouble, the uninvited
This brutal love
Danger, not quite at home
The eyes of temptation, the flesh on my bones
Hello stranger, I'm a disaster
This brutal love
Bad luck, bitters and soda
Anguish and shame, the modern fool
Bad sex, buy me a train wreck
Something for my troubled mind
Bad luck, bitters and soda
Anguish and shame, the modern fool
Mad love, kiss me I'm loaded
Something for my troubled mind
Drop out, drop-dead hideous
How low is this brutal love?
Drop out, drop-dead hideous
How low is this brutal love?
Drop out, drop-dead hideous
How low is this brutal love?
Drop out, drop-dead hideous
How low is this brutal love?
This brutal love
