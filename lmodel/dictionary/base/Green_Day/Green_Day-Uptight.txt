<song artist="Green_Day" title="Uptight">
I woke up on the wrong side of the floor
Made, made my way through the front door
Broke my engagement with myself
Perfect picture of bad health, another notch scratched on my belt
The future just ain't what it used to be
I got a new start on a dead-end road
Peaked, peaked out on reaching new lows
Owe, I paid off all my debts to myself
Perfect picture of bad health, another notch scratched on my belt
The future's in my living room
Uptight, I'm a nag with a gun
Yeah, all night, suicide's last call
I've been uptight all night
I'm a son of a gun
Uptight, I'm a nag with a gun
Yeah, all night, suicide's last call
I've been uptight all night
I'm a son of a gun
Uptight, I'm a nag with a gun
Yeah, all night, suicide's last call
I've been uptight all night
I'm a son of a gun
Uptight, I'm a nag with a gun
Yeah, all night, suicide's last call
I've been uptight all night
I'm a son of a gun
Uptight, I'm a nag with a gun
Yeah, all night, suicide's last call
I've been uptight all night
I'm a son of a gun
Uptight, I'm a nag with a gun
Yeah, all night, suicide's last call
I've been uptight all night
I'm a son of a gun
