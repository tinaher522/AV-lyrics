<song artist="Green_Day" title="409_In_Your_Coffeemaker">
I sit in the state of a daydream
With all of your words flying over my head
Even more time gets wasted in a daze
It should seem obvious to you
Your screams and cries are never going to work
And all of your time gets wasted in my daze
And I'm looking back now at where I have gone wrong
And why I could not seem to get along
My interests are longing to break through these chains
These chains that control my future's aims
I sit in the state of a daydream
With all of your words flying over my head
Even more time gets wasted in a daze
Maybe I'm just too damn lazy
Or maybe I was just brainwashed to think that way
And all of your time gets wasted in my daze
And I'm looking back now at where I have gone wrong
And why I could not seem to get along
My interests are longing to break through these chains
These chains that control my future's aims
I'm looking back now at
Where I have, have gone wrong
And why I could not seem
Could not seem to get along
And I'm looking back now at where I have gone wrong
And why I could not seem to get along
My interests are longing to break through these chains
These chains that control my future's aims
