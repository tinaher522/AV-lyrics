<song artist="Green_Day" title="Rest">
Hey, can you hear me? I'm calling your name
Hello, or is this goodbye?
The gleam in your eyes, it troubles my brain
Will I see it again?
So I can rest my head
Angel, dancing away
As all of my thoughts get rearranged
Angel, turning away
Just when things seem to have changed
So I can rest my head
Hey, can you hear me? I'm calling your name
Hello, or is this goodbye?
The gleam in your eyes, it troubles my brain
Will I see it again?
So I can rest my head
