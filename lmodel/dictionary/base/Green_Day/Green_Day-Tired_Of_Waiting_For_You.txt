<song artist="Green_Day" title="Tired_Of_Waiting_For_You">
So tired, tired of waiting
Tired of waiting for you
So tired, tired of waiting
Tired of waiting for you
I was a lonely soul
I had nobody till I met you
But you're keeping me waiting
All of the time, what can I do?
It's your life
And you can do what you want to do
Do what you like
Please don't keep me waiting
Please don't keep me waiting
'Cause I'm so tired, tired of waiting
Tired of waiting for you
So tired, tired of waiting
Tired of waiting for you
I was a lonely soul
I had nobody till I met you
But you're keeping me waiting
All of the time, what can I do?
It's your life
And you can do what you want to do
Do what you like
But please don't keep me waiting
Please don't keep me waiting
'Cause I'm so tired, tired of waiting
Tired of waiting for you
So tired, tired of waiting
Tired of waiting for you
For you
For you
