<song artist="Green_Day" title="Loss_Of_Control">
Wow
I'm taking down all my enemies
'Cause they're all so fucking useless
A bunch of shit talking drama queens
And they're all filled with excuses
I wanna find me a better scene
Where it's not the same opinion
I'd rather go to a funeral
Than to this high school reunion
April Fool!
Thought you're falling in love
But now you're sucking on a doorknob
That I slammed in your face
Life's a cruel crushing bastard crime
You're a stupid motherfucker
And you're doing the time
'Cause we're all crazy
You're all crazy now
Well, we're so crazy
You've all gone insane
Loss of control
Loss of control
Hanging out all by myself
At least I'm in good company
Hey isn't that old what's his face
That I see walking down the street
I'm gonna hide in the shadows
'Cause I really got nothing to say
We never had anything in common
And I never liked you anyway
April Fool!
Thought you were falling in love
But now you're sucking on a doorknob
That I slammed in your face
Life's a cruel crushing son of a bitch
And you're a stupid motherfucker
Serving shit to the pigs
'Cause we're all crazy
You're all crazy now
Oh, we're so crazy
You've all gone insane
Loss of control
Loss of control
April Fool!
Thought you're falling in love
But now you're sucking on a doorknob
That I slammed in your face
Life's a cruel crushing bastard crime
You're a stupid motherfucker
And you're doing the time
'Cause we're all crazy
You're all crazy now
Oh, we're so crazy
You've all gone insane
Loss of control
Loss of control
