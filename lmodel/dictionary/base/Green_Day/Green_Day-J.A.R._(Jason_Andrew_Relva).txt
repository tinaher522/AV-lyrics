My friend drove off the other day
Now he's gone and all they say
Is you've gotta live 'cause life goes on
But now I see I'm mortal too
I can't live my life like you
Gotta live it up while life goes on
And I think it's alright
That I do what I like
'Cause that's the way I wanna live
That's how I give and I'm still giving
Now I wonder 'bout my friend
If he gave all he could give
'Cause he lived his life like I live mine
If you could see inside my head
Then you'd start to understand
The things I value in my heart
And I think it's alright
That I do what I like
'Cause that's the way I wanna live
That's how I give and I'm still giving
You know that
I know that
You're watching me
And I think it's alright
That I do what I like
'Cause that's the way I wanna live
That's how I give and I'm still giving
Gotta make a plan, gotta do what's right
Can't run around in circles if you want to build a life
But I don't want to make a plan for a day far away
While I'm young and while I'm able, all I want to do is
