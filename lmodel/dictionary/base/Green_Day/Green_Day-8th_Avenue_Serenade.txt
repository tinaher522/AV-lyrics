<song artist="Green_Day" title="8th_Avenue_Serenade">
Say hello from your window
Say goodbye from your car
Say goodnight from your pillow
Say so long from the stars
Take a walk out of my life
Sing to me a lullaby
Cradle songs for a midlife
Don't forget to pass me by
As my imagination runs away
On this 8th Avenue Serenade
Meet me at the bathroom stall
Meet me at the whispering wall
Before all the flames burn out
As my imagination runs away
On this 8th Avenue Serenade
Meet me at the bathroom stall
Meet me at the whispering wall
Before all the flames burn out
