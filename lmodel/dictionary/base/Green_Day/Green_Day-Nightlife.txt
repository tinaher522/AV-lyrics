<song artist="Green_Day" title="Nightlife">
Taking a ride to my old haunts
She's in my blood, I reside in my nightlife
My favorite color's candy apple, girl
And she resides in my mind of my nightlife
What's that I hear? You wanna go for a ride?
Oh, don't be afraid boy, to come inside
I got the thing that you want, the fix that you need
Chase this with a little lust and greed
I'll be the devil on your shoulder saying "Hey boy, come over"
My black heart beats crimson and clover
So, operator, operator, patch my boy in
This is nightlife and I'll get under your skin
Taking a ride to my old haunts
She's in my blood, I reside in my nightlife
My favorite color's candy apple, girl
And she resides in my mind of my nightlife
Short of breath, heart beats fast
Sounds like love, but you know it won't last
Cheap champagne stain on an even cheaper suit
Hope there's more in your pants than a bus route
Red velvet walls, like these sugar coated walls
Girls hang on bar stools for late last calls
This town is full with snakes, mistakes and whisky shakes
It's too late, I already cut the breaks
Well, I am rolling, strolling into town (come inside)
Is it me or am I going crazy? (it's just you)
This dirty city is my sugar town (sugar town)
My little angel of death is my nightlife
Come inside
It's just you
Sugar town
Gonna make a move before I get bored
If you wanna explore my vocal chord
Baby girl coco dancing the cooch
One hand on my knee, one hand on the hooch
Why don't you stick around for one more round
This place is a circus and I know you'll be my clown
'Cause I'm a ringleader, I run the show
And only when I tell ya will it be time to go
Taking a ride to my old haunts
She's in my blood, I reside in my nightlife
My favorite color's candy apple, girl
And she resides in my mind of my nightlife
(Hey boy) She is my nightlife
(Hey boy) She is my nightlife
(Hey boy) She is my nightlife
(See you later) She is my nightlife
