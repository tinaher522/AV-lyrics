<song artist="Green_Day" title="Sex,_Drugs_&_Violence">
All my life trouble follows me
Like a mystery girl
I've been chasing down a memory
Like a mystery girl
I've been getting lost searching my soul
All around this town
I took a wrong turn at growing up
And it's freaking me out
Back at school it never made much sense
Now I pay, but I can't pay attention
Teaching me the hardest lessons of my life
Too dumb to die I guess
But that's the way it goes
Sometimes I must regress to
Sex, drugs &amp; violence
English, math and science
Safety in numbers
Gimme, gimme danger
Well I don't wanna be an imbecile
But Jesus made me that way
All my life I've been running wild
Like a runaway
Wherever the night takes me
Like a stowaway
Back at home it never made much sense
Now I pay, but I can't pay attention
Teaching me the hardest lessons of my life
Too dumb to die I guess
But that's the way it goes
Sometimes I must regress to
Sex, drugs &amp; violence
English, math and science
Safety in numbers
Gimme, gimme danger, hey
Back at home it never made much sense
I can pay, but I can't pay attention
Teaching me the hardest lessons of my life
Too dumb to die I guess
But that's the way it goes
Sometimes I must regress to
Sex, drugs &amp; violence
English, math and science
Safety in numbers
Gimme, gimme danger
Sex, drugs &amp; violence
English, math and science
Safety in numbers
Gimme, gimme danger, ow
