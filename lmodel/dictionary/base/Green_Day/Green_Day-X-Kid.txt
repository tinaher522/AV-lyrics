<song artist="Green_Day" title="X-Kid">
Hey, little kid
Did you wake up late one day?
And you're not so young, but you're still dumb
And you're numb to your old glory, but now it's gone
I fell in love, but it didn't catch your fall
Then I crashed into a wall
Then I fell to pieces on the floor
Now you're sick to death
Bombs away
Here goes nothing, the shouting's over
Hey X-Kid, bombs away
Here goes nothing, the shouting's over and out
Over and out again
I once was old enough to know better
Then I was too young to care
But who cares, I probably would
But Hollywood is dead and gone
You fell in love, but then you just fell apart
Like a kick in the head
You're an X-Kid and you
Never even got started again
Bombs away
Here goes nothing, the shouting's over
Hey X-Kid, bombs away
Here goes nothing, the shouting's over and out
Over and out
And you were searching your soul
And you got lost and out of control
You went over the edge of joking
Died of a broken heart
Hey, little kid
Did you wake up late one day?
And you're not so young, but you're still dumb
You're an X-Kid and you never even got started again
Bombs away
Here goes nothing, the shouting's over
Hey X-Kid, bombs away
Here goes nothing, the shouting's over
Hey X-Kid, bombs away
Here goes nothing, the shouting's over
Hey X-Kid, bombs away
Here goes nothing, the shouting's over and out
Over and out
Over and over and out
