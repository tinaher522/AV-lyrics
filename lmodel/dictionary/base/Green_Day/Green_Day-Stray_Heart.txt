<song artist="Green_Day" title="Stray_Heart">
I lost my way oh baby this stray heart
Went to another. Can you recover baby?
Oh, you are the only one that I'm dreaming of
Your precious heart was torn apart by me and you
You're not alone
Oh and now I'm where I belong
We're not alone
Oh, I'll hold your heart and never let go
Everything that I want, I want from you
But I just can't have you
Everything that I need, I need from you
But I just can't have you
I said thousand times and now a thousand one
We'll never part, I'll never stray again from you
You start discussing for our home to your heart
We'll never part, I'll never stray again from you
You're not alone
Oh and now I'm where I belong
We're not alone
Oh, I'll hold your heart and never let go
Everything that I want, I want from you
But I just can't have you
Everything that I need, I need from you
But I just can't have you
You're not alone
Oh and now I'm where I belong
We're not alone
Oh, I'll hold your heart and never let go
Everything that I want, I want from you
But I just can't have you
Everything that I need, I need from you
But I just can't have you
Everything that I want, I want from you
But I just can't have you
Everything that I need, I need from you
But I just, just can't have you
