<song artist="Green_Day" title="80">
My mental stability reaches its bitter end
And all my senses are coming unglued
Is there any cure for this disease someone called love?
Not as long as there are girls like you
Everything she does questions my mental health
It makes me lose control, I want to hurt myself
If anyone can hear me, slap some sense in me
But you turn your head and I end up talking to myself
Anxiety has got me strung out and frustrated
So I lose my head or I bang it up against the wall
Sometimes I wonder if I should be left alone
Or lock myself up in a padded room
I'd sit and spew my guts out to the open air
'Cause no one wants to hear a drunken fool
Everything she does questions my mental health
It makes me lose control, I just can't trust myself
If anyone can hear me, slap some sense in me
But you turn your head and I end up talking to myself
Anxiety has got me strung out and frustrated
So I lose my head or I bang it up against the wall
I do not mind if this goes on
'Cause now it seems I'm too far gone
I must admit I enjoy myself
80, please keep taking me away
Everything she does questions my mental health
It makes me lose control, I just can't trust myself
If anyone can hear me, slap some sense in me
But you turn your head and I end up talking to myself
Anxiety has got me strung out and frustrated
So I lose my head or I bang it up against the wall
