<song artist="Green_Day" title="Governator">
He's at it again and he's gonna win
Gonna take it for a hell ride anyway
He's on your side, gonna throw you aside
And let the vultures pick apart what's left
Seems like everything
Was just a fraction of a second from being okay
So run and hide 'cause we're all gonna die
And let the vultures pick apart what's left
I'll be back
I'll be back
I'll be back
I'll be back
He's at it again
He's at it again
And it makes great television watching the world end
He's at it again, he's gonna win
Gonna take you for a joyride anyway
You're standing in line, better make up your mind
And let the bastard pick apart what's left of you
Seems like everything
Was just a fraction of a second from being a dream
So run and hide 'cause we're all gonna die
And let the government decide what's left
I'll be back
I'll be back
I'll be back
I'll be back
He's at it again
He's at it again
And it makes great television watching the world end
I'll be back
I'll be back
I'll be back
I'll be back
Walk around I see million possibilities
Well, I know nowhere to go
And I can't comprehend, things this real seems so pretend
I know I don't know
But I'll be back
I'll be back
I'll be back
I'll be back
And it makes great television watching the world end
I'll be back
I'll be back
I'll be back
I'll be back
And it makes great television watching the world end
I'll be back
