<song artist="Green_Day" title="Stop_When_The_Red_Lights_Flash">
Uncomfortable silence
I'll kill it if you want me to
I'm like ultra-violence
I'll kill it if you want me to
Out of sight, out of mind
I'm not the hurting kind
I'll make you surrender
I'll make you surrender
I'll make you surrender
I'll make you surrender
Stop when the red lights flash (wooh)
I'll trade you blood for dirty cash
Life in the catacombs (wooh)
You make me feel like I'm at home
Out of sight, out of mind
I'm not the hurting kind
I'll make you surrender
I'll make you surrender
I'll make you surrender
I'll make you surrender
Out of sight, out of mind
Just give me one more time
I'll make you surrender
I'll make you surrender
I'll make you surrender
I'll make you surrender
I'll make you surrender
I'll make you surrender
I'll make you surrender
I'll make you surrender
