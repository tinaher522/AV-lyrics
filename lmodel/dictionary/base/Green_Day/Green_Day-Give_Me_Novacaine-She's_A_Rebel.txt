Give Me Novacaine
Take away the sensation inside
Bittersweet migraine in my head
It's like a throbbing toothache of the mind
I can't take this feeling anymore
Drain the pressure from the swelling
This sensation’s overwhelming
Give me a long kiss goodnight
And everything'll be alright
Tell me that I won't feel a thing
So give me Novacaine
Out of body and out of mind
Kiss the demons out of my dreams
I get the funny feeling and that's alright
Jimmy says it's better than air
I tell you what
Drain the pressure from the swelling
This sensation’s overwhelming
Give me a long kiss goodnight
And everything will be alright
Tell me that I won't feel a thing
So give me Novacaine
Oh Novacaine
Drain the pressure from the swelling
This sensation’s overwhelming
Give me a long kiss goodnight
And everything will be alright
Tell me Jimmy, I won't feel a thing
So give me Novacaine
She's A Rebel
She's a rebel, she's a saint
She's the salt of the earth and she's dangerous
She's a rebel vigilante
Missing link on the brink of destruction
From Chicago to Toronto
She's the one that they call old Whatsername
She's a symbol of resistance
And she's holding on my heart like a hand grenade
Is she dreaming what I'm thinking?
Is she the mother of all bombs, gonna detonate?
Is she trouble like I'm trouble?
Make it a double twist of fate or a melody
That she sings the revolution
The dawning of our lives
She brings this liberation
That I just can't define
Well, nothing comes to mind
Hey!
She sings the revolution
The dawning of our lives
She brings this liberation
That I just can't define
Well, nothing comes to mind
She's a rebel, she's a saint
She's the salt of the earth and she's dangerous
She's a rebel vigilante
Missing link on the brink of destruction
She's a rebel, she's a saint
She's the salt of the earth and she's dangerous
She's a rebel vigilante
Missing link on the brink of destruction
She's a rebel
She's a rebel
She's a rebel
And she's dangerous
She's a rebel
She's a rebel
She's a rebel
And she's dangerous
