<song artist="Green_Day" title="Sweet_Home_Alabama">
Big wheels keep on turning carry me home to see my kin
Singing songs about the southland
I miss my family once again and I think it's a sin
Well I heard Mr. Young sing about her
Well I heard Ol' Neil put her down
Well I hope Neil Young will remember
A Southern man don't need him around anyhow
CHORUS:
Sweet home Alabama where the skies are so blue
Sweet home Alabama Lord I'm coming home to you
In Birmingham they love the governor boo-hoo-hoo
Now we all did what we could do
Now Watergate does not bother me
Does your conscience bother you tell me true
CHORUS:
Here I come Alabama
SOLO
Now Muscle Shoals has got the swampers, they've been known to pick a song or two
Lord they get me off so much
They pick me up when I'm feelin' blue
Now how about you
CHORUS:
Sweet home Alabama where the skies are so blue oh sweet home
Sweet home Alabama Lord I'm coming home to you And the gov'nor's true
Sweet home Alabama where the skies are so blue oh yeah
Sweet home Alabama Lord I'm coming home to you yeah yeah
