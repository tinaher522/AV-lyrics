<song artist="Green_Day" title="Castaway">
I'm on a sentimental journey into sight and sound
Of no return and no looking back or down
A conscientious objector to the war that's in my mind
I'm leaving in the lurch and I'm taking back what's mine
I'm on a mission
Into destination unknown
An expedition
Into Desolation Road
Where I'm a castaway, going at it alone
Castaway, now I'm on my own
Castaway, going at it alone
Castaway, now I'm on my own
Lost and found
Trouble bound
Castaway
I'm riding on the night train and driving stolen cars
Testing my nerves out on the boulevard
Spontaneous combustion in the corners of my mind
I'm leaving in the lurch and I'm taking back what's mine
I'm on a mission
Into destination unknown
An expedition
Into Desolation Road
Where I'm a castaway, going at it alone
Castaway, now I'm on my own
Castaway, going at it alone
Castaway, now I'm on my own
Lost and found
Trouble bound
Castaway
I'm on a sentimental journey into sight and sound
Of no return and no looking back or down
A conscientious objector to the war that's in my mind
I'm leaving in the lurch and I'm taking back what's mine
I'm on a mission
Into destination unknown
An expedition
Into Desolation Road
Where I'm a castaway, going at it alone
Castaway, now I'm on my own
Castaway, going at it alone
Castaway, now I'm on my own
Lost and found
Trouble bound
Castaway
Castaway
Castaway
