<song artist="Green_Day" title="Teenage_Lobotomy">
Lobotomy!
Lobotomy!
Lobotomy! 
Lobotomy!
DDT did a job on me
Now I am a real sickie
Guess I'll have to break the news
That I got no mind to lose
All the girls are in love with me
I'm a teenage lobotomy
Slugs and snails are after me
DDT keeps me happy
Now I guess I'll have to tell 'em
That I got no cerebellum
Gonna get my Ph.D.
I'm a teenage lobotomy 
Lobotomy!
Lobotomy!
Lobotomy! 
Lobotomy!
DDT did a job on me
Now I am a real sickie
Guess I'll have to break the news
That I got no mind to lose
All the girls are loving me
I'm a teenage lobotomy
