<song artist="Green_Day" title="Makeout_Party">
Hey, you got yourself a pretty little mouth
I think I wanna rub it the wrong way
Do you wanna spin the bottle, play a game of chicken
Well it's a tongue twister till your lips are bleeding
Ah, anyhow, anywhere
Kiss me there, oh kiss me there
Scream and shout, truth or dare
Kiss me there, oh kiss me there
Hey you're so precious, you're a fucking delinquent
Well, I got myself jonesing and I need some fixing
It's a makeout party on another dimension
And it's gonna get credit with some bad intentions, ow
Ah, anyhow, anywhere
Kiss me there, oh kiss me there
Scream and shout, truth or dare
Kiss me there, oh kiss me there, wow
Wow, whoo
Ah ah ah, aah
Hey, you're so precious, you're a fucking delinquent
Well, I got myself jonesing and I need some fixing
It's a makeout party on another dimension
And it's gonna get crowded with some bad intentions, ow
Anyhow, anywhere
Kiss me there, oh kiss me there
Scream and shout, truth or dare
Oh, kiss me there, oh kiss me there
Kiss me there, oh kiss me there
Kiss me there
