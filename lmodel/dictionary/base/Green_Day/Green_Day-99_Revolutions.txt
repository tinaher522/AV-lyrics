<song artist="Green_Day" title="99_Revolutions">
There's a trouble in the air
A rumble in the streets
A goin' out of business sale
In a race to bankruptcy
It's not 1 to 99, it's 99 to 1
A common cause and a call to arms
For the health of our daughters
And our sons
It's 99 revolutions tonight
99 revolutions tonight
99 revolutions tonight
99 revolutions tonight
There's a rat in the company
A bailout on easy street
How the fuck did the working stiff
Become so obsolete?
Hit the lights and bang the drums
And let your flag unfold
'Cause history will prove itself
In the halls of justice and lost souls
It's 99 revolutions tonight
99 revolutions tonight
99 revolutions tonight
99 revolutions tonight
We live in troubled times
From the ghetto to an empty suburban home
We live in troubled times
And I'm 99 percent sure that something's wrong
It's all wrong
It's 99 revolutions tonight
99 revolutions tonight
99 revolutions tonight
99 revolutions tonight
99 revolutions tonight
99 revolutions tonight
99 revolutions tonight
99 revolutions tonight
9-9, to 1
To 1
