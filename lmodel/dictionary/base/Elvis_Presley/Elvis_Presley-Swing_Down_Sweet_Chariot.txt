<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="Swing_Down_Sweet_Chariot">
Why don't you swing down, sweet chariot
Stop and let me ride
Swing down, chariot
Stop and let me ride
Rock me, Lord, rock me, Lord
Calm and easy
Well, I've got a home on the other side
Why don't you swing down, sweet chariot
Stop and let me ride
Swing down, chariot
Stop and let me ride
Rock me, Lord, rock me, Lord
Calm and easy
Well, I've got a home on the other side
Well, well, well, well, well, well
Ezekiel went down in the middle of a field
He saw an angel workin' on a chariot wheel
Wasn't so particular 'bout the chariot wheel
Just wanted to see how a chariot feel
Why don't you swing down, sweet chariot
Stop and let me ride
Swing down, chariot
Stop and let me ride
Rock me, Lord, rock me, Lord
Calm and easy
Well, I've got a home on the other side
Well, well, well Ezekiel went down and he got on board
Chariot went a bumpin' on down the road
Zeke wasn't so particular 'bout the bumpin' of the road
Just wanted to lay down his heavy load
Why don't you swing down, sweet chariot
Stop and let me ride
Swing down, chariot
Stop and let me ride
Rock me, Lord, rock me, Lord
Calm and easy
Well, I've got a home on the other side
Well, I got a Father in the promised land
Ain't no more stoppin' till I shake His hand
Rock me, Lord, rock me, Lord
Calm and easy
I've got a home on the other side
Why don't you swing down, sweet chariot
Stop and let me ride
Swing down, chariot
Stop and let me ride
Rock me, Lord, rock me, Lord
Calm and easy
Well, I've got a home on the other side
