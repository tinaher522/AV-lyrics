<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="Take_Me_To_The_Fair">
Take me to the fair
Take me to the fair, don't know anywhere
I would rather be
Let's, go to the fair
We'll walk hand in hand, through Tomorrow Land
Only you and me
I wanna see everything, do everything
While we're doin' it all
I'll buy the peanuts and popcorn
We'll have us a ball
You can spend my pay
Crush me in the crowds, I'll be in the clouds
Honey I don't care
Take me there by sleigh
Go, let's get a bite, anywhere you like
But take me to the fair
I wanna see everything, do everything
While we're doin' it all
I'll buy the peanuts and popcorn
We'll have us a ball
Take me there by sleigh
Go, let's have a bite, anywhere you like
But take me to the fair
Take me to the fair, Take me to the fair
Take me to the fair
