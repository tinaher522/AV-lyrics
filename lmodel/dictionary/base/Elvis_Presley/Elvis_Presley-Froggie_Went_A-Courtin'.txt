<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="Froggie_Went_A-Courtin'">
Froggy went a-courtin' and he did ride, a-hu
Froggy went a-courtin' and he did ride, a-hu
Froggy went a-courtin' and he did ride
He had a nick-nack-nack by his side, a-hu, a-hu, a-hu
Froggy went a-courtin' and he did ride, a-hu
Froggy went a-courtin' and he did ride, a-hu
Froggy went a-courtin' and he did ride
He had a nick-nack-nack by his side, a-hu, a-hu, a-hu
Froggy went a-courtin' and he did ride, a-hu
Froggy went a-courtin' and he did ride, a-hu
Froggy went a-courtin' and he did ride
He had a nick-nack-nack by his side, a-hu, a-hu, a-hu
Froggy went a-courtin' and he did ride, a-hu
Froggy went a-courtin' and he did ride, a-hu
Froggy went a-courtin' and he did ride
He had a nick-nack-nack by his side, a-hu, a-hu, a-hu
Froggy went a-courtin' and he did ride, a-hu
Froggy went a-courtin' and he did ride, a-hu
Froggy went a-courtin' and he did ride
He had a nick-nack-nack by his side, a-hu, a-hu, a-hu
Froggy went a-courtin' and he did ride, a-hu
Froggy went a-courtin' and he did ride
Froggy went a-courtin' and he did ride
He had old Jerry by his side, a-hu, a-hu, oh, yeah
