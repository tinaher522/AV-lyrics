<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="Stuck_On_You">
You can shake an apple off an apple tree
Shake-a, shake- sugar, but you'll never shake me
Uh-uh-uh
No-sir-ee, uh, uh
I'm gonna stick like glue
Stick because I'm stuck on you
I'm gonna run my fingers through your long black hair
Squeeze you tighter than a grizzly bear
Uh-uh-uh
Yes-sir-ee, uh, uh
I'm gonna stick like glue
Stick because I'm stuck on you
Hide in the kitchen, hide in the hall
Ain't gonna do you no good at all
'Cause once I catch ya and the kissin' starts
A team o' wild horses couldn't tear us apart
Son to take a tiger from his daddy's side
That's how love is gonna keep us tied
Uh-uh-uh
Uh-uh-uh
Oh yeah, uh-uh-uh
I'm gonna stick like glue
Stick, because I'm stuck on you
Hide in the kitchen, hide in the hall
Ain't gonna do you no good at all
'Cause once I catch ya and the kissin' starts
A team o' wild horses couldn't tear us apart
Son to take a tiger from his daddy's side
That's how love is gonna keep us tied
Uh-uh-uh
Yes-sir-ee, uh,uh
I'm gonna stick like glue
Yeah yeah, because I'm stuck on you
I'm gonna stick like glue
Yeah yeah, because I'm stuck on you
I'm gonna stick like glue
Yeah yeah, because I'm stuck on you
