<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="Santa_Bring_My_Baby_Back">
I don't need a lot of presents
To make my Christmas bright
I just need my baby's arms
Wound around me tight
Oh oh santa hear my plea
Santa bring my baby back to me
The Christmas tree is ready
The candles all aglow
But with my baby far away
What good is mistletoe
Oh oh Santa, hear my plea
Santa bring my baby back to me
Please make these reindeer hurry
Well their time is drawing near
It sure won't seem like Christmas
Until my baby's here
Don't fill my sock with candy
No bright and shiny toy
You wanna make me happy
and fill my heart with joy
Then Santa, hear my plea
Santa bring my baby back to me
Please make these reindeer hurry
Well their time is drawing near
It sure won't seem like Christmas
Until my baby's here
Don't fill my sock with candy
No bright and shiny toy
You wanna make me happy
and fill my heart with joy
Then Santa, hear my plea
Santa bring my baby back to me
Then Santa, hear my plea
Santa bring my baby back to me
