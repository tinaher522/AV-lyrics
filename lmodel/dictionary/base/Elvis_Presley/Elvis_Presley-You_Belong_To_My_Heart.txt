<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="You_Belong_To_My_Heart">
You belong to my heart
Now and forever.
And our love had it's start
Not long ago
We were gathering stars while a million guitars
Played our love song
When I said I love you
Every beat of my heart said it too
'twas a moment like this
Do you remember?
And your eyes threw a kiss
Not long ago
Now we own all the starsw 
And a million guitars
Are still playing
Darling you are the song
And you'll always belong to my heart
