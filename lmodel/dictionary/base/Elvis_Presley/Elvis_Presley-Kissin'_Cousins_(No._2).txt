<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="Kissin'_Cousins_(No._2)">
Well I've got a gal, she's as cute as she can be
She's a distant cousin but she's not too distant with me
We'll kiss all night, I'll squeeze her tight
But we're kissin' cousins that's what makes it all right
All right, all right, all right
Oh I've got a girl and she taught me how to live
She can give a lot and she's got a lot to give
We'll kiss all night, I'll squeeze her tight
But we're kissin' cousins an' that's what makes it all right
All right, all right, all right
Yes we're all cousins, that's what I believe
Because we're children of Adam and Eve
I got a girl and she wants a lot of love
That's the kind of trouble I need plenty of
We'll kiss all night, I'll squeeze her tight
But we'll be kissin' cousins an' that'll make it all right
All right, all right, all right
But we'll be kissin' cousins that'll make it all right
All right, all right, all right
Yeah we're all cousins, that's what I believe
Because we're all children of Adam and Eve
I got a girl and she wants a lot of love
That's the kind of trouble I need plenty of
We'll kiss all night, I'll squeeze her tight
And we'll be kissin' cousins an' that'll make it all right
All right, all right, all right
We'll be kissin' cousins that'll make it all right
All right, all right, all right
