<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="I've_Got_To_Find_My_Baby">
I've got to find my baby
I wonder where can she be
Has anybody seen her?
Send her back to me
She left me here all alone
And I ain't had no lovin', (hey hey hey)
Since my baby's been gone
My baby's gone
I've gotta find my baby
I gotta hold her tight
And tell her I love her
That everything's alright
So I'll keep searching all night long
'Cause I ain't had no lovin', (hey hey hey)
Since my baby's been gone
My baby's gone
I've gotta find my baby
I've gotta find my baby
Gotta find my baby
