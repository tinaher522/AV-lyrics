<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="Big_Boots">
They call your daddy big boots
And big boots is his name
It takes a big man to wear big boots
That's your daddy's claim to fame
They know your daddy big boots
Wherever soldiers are
'cause he can handle an armored tank
Just like a kiddy can
So sleep little soldier
Don't you cry
Loo loo loo loo
Loo loo loo
General sandman's soon coming by
Loo loo loo loo
Loo loo loo
I'm gonna tell you a little secret
You won't believe it's true
Did you know your
Daddy big boots
Once wore little boots like you
