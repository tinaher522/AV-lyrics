<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="Patch_It_Up_-_Alternate_Take_9">
We've got to patch it up, baby
Before we fall apart at the seams
We've got to patch it up, baby
We can't let time unravel our dreams
Let's go back and touch the past
One more night is all I ask, get the feelin'
That old feelin', feelin' healin'
We can patch it up, baby
We can patch it up, baby
We can patch it up, baby
Patch it up with all our love
We got to patch it up, baby
We'll sweep out all the cobwebs of our hearts
We've got to patch it up, baby
Before our difference pulls us apart
Don't let the good love die
Let's just give it one more try, get the feelin'
That old feelin', feelin' healin'
We can patch it up, baby
We can patch it up, baby
We can patch it up, baby
Patch it up with all our love
Oh, we can patch it up, baby
We can patch it up, baby
We can patch it up, baby
Patch it up with all our love
We can patch it up, baby
We can patch it up, baby
We can patch it up, baby
Patch it up with all our love
We can patch it up, baby
We can patch it up, baby
We can patch it up with all our love
We can patch it up, baby
We can patch it up, baby
Patch it up with all our love
