Oh Happy Day
Oh Happy Day
When Jesus washed
Oh when he washed
Oh when he washed
Washed my sins away
Oh Happy Day
Oh Happy Day
Oh Happy Day
When Jesus washed
Oh when he washed
And then he washed
Washed my sins away
Oh it's a Happy Day
He taught me how
To watch watch and pray
Watch and pray
And live rejoicing everyday
Everyday
Oh Happy Day
Oh Happy Day
When Jesus washed
Oh when he washed
Oh when he washed
Washed my sins away
Oh it's a Happy Day
He taught me how
To watch watch and pray
Watch and pray
And live rejoicing everyday
Everyday
Oh Happy Day
Oh it's a Happy Day
Oh it's a Happy Day
Oh Happy Day
Oh Happy Happy Day
Oh Happy Happy Day
Oh it's a Happy Day
And when I'll get to Heaven
Will be a Happy Day
Oh Happy Day
Oh it's a Happy Day
Oh my Lord have mercy
When I'll get to Heaven
Oh Hapy Happy Day
Oh it's a Happy Day
Oh Happy Day
Oh Happy Day
When Jesus washed
Oh when he washed
When Jesus washed
Washed my sins away
Oh it's a Happy Day
Oh Happy Day
Oh Happy Day
Oh Happy Day
