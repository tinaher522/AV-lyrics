I said see, see see rider
Oh see what you have done (Yea yea yea)
I said see (see see rider) see see rider (see see rider)
Oh see, (see see rider) what you have done
(Yea yea yea)
Oh girl, you made me love you
Now, now, now, your loving man has gone
(see see rider) Girl what'd I say (see see rider)
Well, I'm going away, baby
And I won't be back till fall
(Yea, yea, yea)
And I'm going away baby
And I won't be back till fall
(Yea, yea, yea)
Well, if I find me a good girl
I won't, I won't, I won't be back at all
Girl what'd I say
I said see, (see see rider)
See see rider (see see rider)
Oh see (see see rider) what you have done
(Yea, yea, yea)
I said see (see see rider) see see rider (see see rider)
Oh see, (see see rider) what you have done

Oh girl, you made me love you
Now, now, now, your loving man has gone
Play it JB, (see see rider) (see see rider)
(Yea yea yea)

Whoo, hear what I say
I said see (see see rider) see see rider (see see rider)
Oh see, (see see rider) what you have done (Yea yea yea)
I said see (see see rider) see see rider (see see rider)
Oh see, (see see rider) what you have done (Yea yea yea)
Oh girl, you made me love you
Now, now, now, your loving man has gone
Well what I say
Now I said see, (see see rider) see see rider (see see rider)
I said see, (see see rider) see see rider (see see rider)
I said see, (see see rider) see see rider (see see rider)
I said see, (see see rider) see see rider (see see rider)
I said see, (see see rider) see see rider (see see rider)
