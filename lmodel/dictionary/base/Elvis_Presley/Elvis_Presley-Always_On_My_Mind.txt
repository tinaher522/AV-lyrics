<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="Always_On_My_Mind">
Maybe I maybe I didn't treat you
Quite as good as I should have
And maybe I didn't love you
Quite as often as I could have
Little things I should have said and done
I just never took the time
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
And maybe I didn't hold you
All those lonely, lonely times
And I guess I never told you
I'm so happy that you're mine
If I made you feel second best
Girl I'm sorry I was blind
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
Tell me, Tell me that your sweet love hasn't died
Give me, give me one more chance to keep you satisfied
I'll keep you satisfied
Little things I should have said and done
I just never took the time
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
