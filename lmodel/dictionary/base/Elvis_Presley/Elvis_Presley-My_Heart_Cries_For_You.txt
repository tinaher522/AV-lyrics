<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="My_Heart_Cries_For_You">
If you're in Arizona, I'll follow you
If you're in Albuquerque, I'll be there too
We'll have a little chance to start a-new
Because my love is endless for you
My heart cries for you
Sighs for you, dies for you
My arms long for you
Please come back to me
An unimportant quarrel
Is what we had
We have to learn to live with the good and bad
Come together da da da la dum....
This loneliness is driving me mad
My heart cries for you
Sighs for you, dies for you
My arms long for you
Please come back to me
My heart cries for you
Sighs for you, dies for you
My arms long for you
Please come back to me
Please come back, come back, come back to me
