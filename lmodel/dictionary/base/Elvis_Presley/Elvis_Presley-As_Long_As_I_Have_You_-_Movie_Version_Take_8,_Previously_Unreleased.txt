<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="As_Long_As_I_Have_You_-_Movie_Version_Take_8,_Previously_Unreleased">
Let the stars fade and fall and I won't care at all
As long as I have you
Every kiss brings a thrill and I know that it will
As long as I have you
Let's think of the future, forget the past
You're not my first love but you're my last
Take the love that I bring then I'll have everything
As long as I have you
Let's think of the future, forget the past
You're not my first love but you're my last
Take the love that I bring then I'll have everything
As long as I have you
