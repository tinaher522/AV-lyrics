<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="Write_To_Me_From_Naples">
Write to me from Naples
Tell me all that's new 
I loved you in Naples
More than words can say
Call me cara mia
Tell me all that's new
Write to me from Naples
Keep my heart with you
I can hear a mandolino
Softly it cries
While I raise a glass of vino
Praising your eyes
Since we said a rivederci
My poor heart cries
Just for a letter from you
Write to me from Naples
Tell me all that's new
Write to me from Naples
Keep my heart with you
Please come back, come back to me
