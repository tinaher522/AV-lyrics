<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="The_First_Noel">
The first Noel the angels did sing
Was to certain poor shepherds
In fields as they lay
In fields fields where they lay keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the king of Israel
And to the Earth it gave great light
And so it continued both day and night
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the king of Israel
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the king of Israel
