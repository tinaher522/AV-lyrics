<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="Sing_You_Children">
Oh Jonah he was desperate
In the belly of the whale
Well jonah had a plan
He knew he couldn't fail
He raised his head on high
And looking for the sky
And he sang his song so pretty
The whale told him goodbye
You got to sing you children sing
Sing you children sing
I only know one thing, hey! hey! hey!
Sing you children sing, everybody
Sing you children sing
Sing your troubles away
Well, Moses said good lord
Open up these waters for me
So I can get your chidren
Across the salty sea
Well the Lord parted the waters
And singing hand in hand
Moses and the children
Walked over to the promised land
You got to sing you children sing
Sing you children sing (Hallelujah)
I only know one thing, hey! hey! hey!
Sing you children sing, everybody
Sing you children sing (Hallelujah)
Sing your troubles away
Oh Joshua had a plan
At the walls of Jericho
He'd march around those walls
And on his horn he'd blow
That horn would play a tune
And sing a happy song
When Joshua got through
Those walls came tumbling down
You got to sing you children sing
Sing you children sing (Hallelujah)
I only know one thing, hey! hey! hey!
Sing you children sing, everybody
Sing you children sing (Hallelujah)
Sing your troubles away
You got to sing your troubles away
Sing your troubles away
You've got to sing your troubles away
Sing your troubles away
Sing your troubles away
