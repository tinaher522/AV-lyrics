<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="Little_Cabin_Home_On_The_Hill">
Tonight I'm alone without you my dear
It seems there's a longing for you still
But I just keep it there so I won't be alone
In our little cabin home on the hill
Where someone has taken you from me
And left me here all alone
To listen to the rain beat on our window pane
In our little cabin home on the hill
