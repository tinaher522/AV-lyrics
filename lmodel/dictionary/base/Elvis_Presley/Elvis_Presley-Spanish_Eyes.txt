<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="Spanish_Eyes">
Blue spanish eyes teardrops are falling from your spanish eyes
Please please don't cry, this is just adios and not good-bye
Soon I'll return, bringing you all the love your heart can hold
Please say si si say you and your spanish eyes will wait for me
Soon I'll return, bringing you all the love your heart can hold
Please say si si say you and your spanish eyes will wait for me
Say you and your spanish eyes will wait for me
