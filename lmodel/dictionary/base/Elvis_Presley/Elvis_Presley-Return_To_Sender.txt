<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="Return_To_Sender">
Return to sender
Return to sender
I gave a letter to the postman
He put it his sack
Bright and early next morning
He brought my letter back
She wrote upon it:
Return to sender, address unknown
No such number, no such zone
We had a quarrel, a lover's spat
I write "I'm sorry", but my letter keeps coming back
So then I dropped it in the mailbox 
And sent it special D
Bright and early next morning 
It came right back to me
She wrote upon it:
Return to sender, address unknown
No such person, no such zone
This time I'm gonna take it myself
And put it right in her hand
And if it comes back the very next day 
Then I'll understand
The writing on it
Return to sender, address unknown
No such number, no such zone
Return to sender
Return to sender
Return to sender
Return to sender
