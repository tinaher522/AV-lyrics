<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="Rubberneckin'_(Paul_Oakenfold_Remix)">
Stop, look and listen baby that's my philosophy
It's called rubberneckin' baby but that's all right with me
Stop, look and listen baby that's my philosophy
It's called rubberneckin' baby but that's all right with me
Stop, look and listen baby that's my philosophy
It's called rubberneckin' baby but that's all right with me
Some people say I'm wasting time, they don't really know
Like what I see I see what I like yeh, it gives me such a glow
Hey, hey, hey
The First thing in the morning, last thing at night
I look, stare everywhere and see everything inside
Hey, hey, hey
Stop, look and listen baby that's my philosophy
It's called rubberneckin' baby but that's all right with me
People say I'm wasting time yeh, but I don't really care
I see what I like I like what I see yeh, it gives me such a glow
Ho, ho, ho
Sittin' on the back porch all by myself
Along came Mary Jane with somebody else
Hey, hey, hey
Stop, look and listen baby that's my philosophy
It's called rubberneckin' baby, that's all right with me, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Stop, look and listen baby that's my philosophy
It's called rubberneckin' baby, that's all right with me, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, baby that's all right with me
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, rubberneckin' baby but that's all right with me
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,
Stop
