<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="An_Evening_Prayer">
If I have wounded any soul today
If I have caused one's foot to go
If I have lost in my own misery
Dear Lord, forgive
Forgive the sins I have confessed to Thee
Forgive my secret sins I do
Oh God watch over me and my misery
Dear Lord, Lord, amend
