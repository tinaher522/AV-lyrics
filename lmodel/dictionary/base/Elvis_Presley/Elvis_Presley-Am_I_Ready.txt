<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="Am_I_Ready">
Am I ready? Can my heart be true?
Am I ready to fall in love with you?
One love, one girl, one dream shared by two
Am I ready to fall in love with you?
I have touched your lips and now I know
I would be a fool to let you go
Should I? Could I? How I wish I knew
Am I ready to fall in love with you
Should I? Could I? How I wish I knew
Am I ready to fall in love with you
Fall in love with you
