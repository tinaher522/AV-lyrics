<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="A_Little_Less_Conversation">
Hey!
A little less conversation a little more action,
All this aggravation ain't satisfactioning me,
A little more bite a little less bark,
A little less fight and a little more spark,
Close your mouth and open up your heart and baby satisfy me,
Satisfy me baby.
Baby close your eyes and listen to the music,
Dig to the summer breeze,
It's a groovy night and I can show you how to use it,
Come along with me and put your mind at ease hey.
A little less conversation a little more action please,
All this aggravation ain't satisfactioning me,
A little more bite a little less bark,
A little less fight and a little more spark,
Shut your mouth and open up your heart and baby satisfy me,
Satisfy me baby.
Come on baby I'm tired of talking.
Grab your coat and let's start walking,
Come on come on,
Come on come on,
Come on come on,
Don't procrastinate, 
Don't articulate,
Girl it's getting late,
You just sit and wait around.
Yeah, a little less conversation a little more action,
All this aggravation ain't satisfactioning me,
A little more bite a little less bark,
A little less fight and a little more spark,
Shut your mouth and open up your heart and baby satisfy me,
Satisfy me baby.
