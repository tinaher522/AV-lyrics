<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="I_Just_Can't_Make_It_By_Myself">
I need Jesus to guide me every day
As I'm travellin' along this rough and narrow way
Though afflictions fill my soul
I'm determined to make the goal
I've gotta have Jesus 'cause I just can't make it by myself
Every day I pray (pray) pray (pray)
Pray (pray) pray (pray)
I pray (pray) pray (pray
Pray pray pray
Pray and ask the Lord Jesus
Don't leave me by myself
Every mornin' through the years I pray
You know I've got to have Jesus
I just can't it by myself
By myself
