<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="Smorgasbord">
Some like their women short
Some like 'em tall
I'll take them any size
'Cause I love them all
I'm just wild about smorgasbord
I got a cravin' for smorgasbord
A little kiss here, a little kiss there
That's smorgasbord
Mmm
Some take just apple pie
Some take just cake
I'll take the dish I please
Please the dish I take
I'm just wild about smorgasbord
I got a cravin' for smorgasbord
A little kiss here, a little kiss there
That's smorgasbord
Mmm, aah
Some like just southern belles
They got a one track mind
I go for all the bells
Except the wedding kind
I'm just wild about smorgasbord
I got a cravin' for smorgasbord
A little kiss here, a little kiss there
That's smorgasbord
Some like their women short
Some like 'em tall
I'll take 'em any size
'Cause I love them all, mmm
Some take just apple pie
Some take just cake
