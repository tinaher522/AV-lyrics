<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="Hands_Off">
Keep your hands off of her
She don't belong to you
Keep your hands off of her
She don't belong to you
She's mine, o mine, no matter what I do
She's long, lean and lanky
Tadadadaadaaa
Hands off of her, she don't belong to you
She's mine, o mine, no matter what I do
