<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="This_Is_Our_Dance">
We had a real good evening
Now all our friends are leaving
Soon we'll be alone
Wait till everybody has gone
Then play just one more song
'cause this is our dance
Darling remember, it's our dance
Loving and tender
I'll take you away, take you away
In my arms
Yes this is our dance, now we're together
For our dance can't last forever
And nobody knows just what tomorrow will bring
So let our dance begin
We'll turn the light down low now
I'll never let you go now
You're here in my arms
And when I hear you whisper you're mine
We'll play that song just one more time
'cause this is our dance
Darling remember, it's our dance
Loving and tender
I'll take you away, take you away
In my arms
Yes this is our dance, now we're together
For our dance can't last forever
And nobody knows just what tomorrow will bring
So let our dance begin
