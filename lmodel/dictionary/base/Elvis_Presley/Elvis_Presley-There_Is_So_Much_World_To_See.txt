<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="There_Is_So_Much_World_To_See">
Baby it's wrong, wrong as can be
To try and tie guy like me
I could never settle down in a little sleepy town
There's so much world to see
Sure we'd be happy for a while
But then we'd have to part
When tears replace your loving smile
Well, I don't want to be the guy who has to break your heart
So here's where it ends, not lovers but friends
Though your lips are tempting me
Maybe I'm a fool and yet this wanderer just can't forget
There's so much world to see
Sure we'd be happy for a while
But then we'd have to part
When tears replace your loving smile
Well I don't want to be the guy who has to break your heart
So here's where it ends, not lovers but friends
Though your lips are tempting me
Maybe I'm a fool and yet this wanderer just can't forget
There's so much world to see for me
There's so much world to see, yeah, yeah, mmm
