<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="Scratch_My_Back_(Then_I'll_Scratch_Yours)">
One good turn deserves another
Be my love, I'll be your lover
It's all part of nature's laws
If you'll scratch my back then I'll scratch yours.
If you'll scratch my back then I'll scratch your back
Like two peas in a pack, let's get rid of our itch together, hmm
Joy they say is in the giving
Come on give, make life worth living
Your welfare is my concern
Do a favour for me, I'll do one in return
If you'll scratch my back then I'll scratch your back
Like two peas in a pack, let's get rid of our itch together, hmm
Scratch me now a little lower
What a feeling do it slower
That's it, hmm you're getting hot
Well I gotta admit, you just hit the spot
If you'll scratch my back then I'll scratch your back
Like two peas in a pack, let's get rid of our itch together, hmm
If you'll scratch my back then I'll scratch your back
