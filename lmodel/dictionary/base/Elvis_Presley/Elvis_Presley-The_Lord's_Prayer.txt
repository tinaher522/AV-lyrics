<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="The_Lord's_Prayer">
Our Father, Who Art in Heaven
Hallowed be, Thy Name
Thy Kingdom come, Thy will be Done
On earth, as it is, in Heaven
Give us this day, our daily bread
And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors
And lead us not into temptation,but deliver us from evil
For Thine is the Kingdom, and the Power, and the Glory forever
Amen
