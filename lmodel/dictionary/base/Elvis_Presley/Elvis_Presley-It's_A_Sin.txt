<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="It's_A_Sin">
It's a sin, my darling
How I love you
Because I know
Our love could never be
It's a sin
To keep this memory of you
When silence proves
That you've forgotten me
The dreams I built for us
Has tumbled
Each promise broken
Like my heart
It's a sin, my darling
How I love you
So much in love
And yet so far apart
I'm sure you're happy with another
Who shares the love I cannot win
Why pretend that I can live without you
When deep inside I know that it's a sin
