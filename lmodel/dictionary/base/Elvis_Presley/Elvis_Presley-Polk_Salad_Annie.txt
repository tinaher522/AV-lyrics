<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="Polk_Salad_Annie">
Some of you all never been down South too much
I'm gonna tell you a little story, 
So you'll understand where I'm talking about
Down there we have a plant that
Grows out in the woods and the fields
And it looks something like a turnip green
Everybody calls it Polk salad
Now that's Polk salad
Used to know a girl that lived down there and 
She'd go out in the evenings to pick a mess of it
Carry it home and cook it for supper
'Cause that's about all they had to eat
But they did all right
Down in Louisiana
Where the alligators grow so mean
Lived a girl that I swear to the world
Made the alligators look tame
Polk salad Annie
'Gators got your granny
Everybody said it was a shame
For the mama was working on the chain gang
What a mean, vicious woman
Everyday before suppertime
She'd go down by the truck patch
And pick her a mess of polk salad
And carry it home in a tote sack
Polk salad Annie
'Gators got you granny
Everybody said it was a shame
'Cause the mama was working on the chain gang
(Whoo) How wretched, spiteful
Straight-razor totin' woman
Lord have mercy
Sock a little polk salad to me
Yeah, you know what, yeah, yeah
But daddy was a lazy and a no count
Claimed he had a bad back
All her brothers were fit for
Was stealing watermelons out of my truck patch
Polk salad Annie
'Gators got your granny
Everybody said it was a shame
Because mama was working on the chain gang
Sock a little polk salad to me
You know what makes a meal mention
You sock a little
Hey, hey, hey, yeah, yeah
Chic a bon, chic a bon
Chic a bon bon bon bon
Chic a bon, chic a bon
Chic a bon bon bon bon
Sock a little Polk salad to me
You know what makes a meal mention
Sock a little Polk salad to him
You know what meets a meal mention
Chinc, chinc, chinc,
Chin, ling, ling ling
