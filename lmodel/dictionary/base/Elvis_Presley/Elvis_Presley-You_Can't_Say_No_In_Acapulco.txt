<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="You_Can't_Say_No_In_Acapulco">
You can't say no, in Acapulco
With every beat your heart will answer yes
Where lovers sing instead of talk
And dance instead of walk together
In a night, that's filled with stars
And strumming guitars
You can't say no, in Acapulco
Where romance blooms, and love is in the air
So kiss me tender, love me true
Darling feel this magic too
Don't say no, you can't say no, in Acapulco
You can't say no, in Acapulco
Where romance blooms, and love is in the air
So kiss me tender, love me true
Darling feel this magic too
Don't say no, you can't say no, in Acapulco
Don't say no...you can't say no, in Acapulco
