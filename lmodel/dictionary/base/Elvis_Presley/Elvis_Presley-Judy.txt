<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="Judy">
They say you found somebody new
Whose love will always be true
I don't know what it is to be alone
That's why I dread to know you're gone
Oh Judy, don't let our sweet love
Wither and die like flowers in the fall
Oh Judy, don't you know it's you
I love most of all
Oh, please come back I promise always to be true
Oh Judy, there'll never be anyone else dear but you
Oh, please come back I promise always to be true
Oh Judy, there'll never be anyone else dear but you
