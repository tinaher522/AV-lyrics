<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="Don't_Forbid_Me">
Don't forbid me to hold you tight
Darling don't forbid me to hold you tight
Take me in your lovin' arms
'cause it's cold and I can keep you warm
Don't forbid me to talk sweet nothings
Don't forbid me to talk sweet talk
Take me in your arms baby please
'cause it's cold, it's cold and your lips might freeze
