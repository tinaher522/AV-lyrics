<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="Moody_Blue">
Well, it's hard to be a gambler 
Bettin' on the number
That changes ev'ry time
Well, you think you're gonna win
Think she's givin' in
A stranger's all you find
Yeah, it's hard to figure out
What she's all about
But she's woman through and through
She's a complicated lady
So color my baby moody blue
Oh, Moody blue
Tell me am I gettin' through
I keep hangin' on, try to learn the song
But I never do
Oh, Moody blue
Tell me who I'm talkin' to
You're like the night and day and it's hard to say
Which one is you
Well, when Monday comes she's Tuesday
When Tuesday comes she's Wednesday
Into another day again
Her personality unwinds
Just like a ball of twine
On a spool that never ends
Just when I think I know her well
Her emotions reveal 
She's not the person that I though I knew
She's a complicated lady
So color my baby moody blue
Oh, Moody blue
Tell me am I gettin' through
I keep hangin' on, try to learn the song
But I never do
Oh, Moody blue
Tell me who I'm talkin' to
You're like the night and day and it's hard to say
Which one is you
I'm afraid of my Moody blue
Oh, Moody blue
Tell me who I'm talkin' to
You're like the night and day and it's hard to say
Which one is you
Yeah, Moody blue
Tell me am I gettin' through
I keep hangin' on, try to learn the song
But I never do
Let me tell you 'bout Moody blue
