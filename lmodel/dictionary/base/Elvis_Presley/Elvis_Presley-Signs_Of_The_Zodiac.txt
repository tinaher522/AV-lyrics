Tony is a Capricorn, a leader of men
And he has a kinda stubborn streak
But when it comes to the opposite sex
Tony's kinda shy and weak
Oh, but he can be hot stuff
See the look on his face
If you want a wedding
It's him you've gotta chase
Uh, uh, uh
Signs of the zodiac, signs of the zodiac
The future is in those little signs of the zodiac
Michael is a Scorpio; he can't make up his mind
Poor boy he can't decide at all
He wants one girl and then another
Soon there'll be none left but mother
Oh, but, Michael, that won't do
That just won't do at all
You can't marry your mother
Your mother's much too tall, ha ha, ho ho
Signs of the zodiac, signs of the zodiac
The future is in those little signs of the zodiac
Billy is a Libra, a sign of love
Billy has a one-track mind
He's great in the kitchen and never complains
He's the happily married kind
Help is there in your future if you just look around
You don't know your astrology from a hole in the ground
Signs of the zodiac, signs of the zodiac
The future is in those little signs of the zodiac
