<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="Rags_To_Rickes">
I know I'd go from rags to riches
If you would only say you cared
And though my pockets may be empty
I'd be a millionaire
My clothes may still be torn and tattered
But in my heart I'd be a king
Your love is all that ever mattered
It's everything
So open your arms and you'll open the door
To all the treasure that I'm living for
Hold me and kiss me and tell me you're mine evermore
Must I forever stay a beggar
Whose golden dreams will not come true
Or will I go from rags to riches?
My fate is up to you
