<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="Loving_You_-_Slow_Version,_Alternate_Master">
I will spend my whole life through
Loving you, just loving you
Winter, summer, spring time, too
Loving you, loving you
Makes no difference where I go
Or what I do
You know that I'll always be
Loving you, [Incomprehensible]
If I'm seen with someone new
Don't be blue, don't you be blue
I'll be faithful, I'll be true
Always true, true to you
There is only one for me
And you know who
You know that I'll always be
Loving you
