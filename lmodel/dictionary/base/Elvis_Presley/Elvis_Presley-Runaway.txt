<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="Runaway">
As I walk along I wonder
What went wrong with our love
A love that was so strong
And as I still walk by
I think off the times we've had together
While our hearts were young
I'm a-walking in the rain
Hear it falling and I feel the pain
Wishing you were here by me
To end this misery
And I wonder
Why (Why, I wonder)
You went away
Yes, I wonder, where you will stay
My little runaway
Run, run, run, run, runaway
I'm a-walking in the rain
Hear it falling and I feel the pain
Wishing you were here by me
To end this misery
And I wonder
(I wonder) Why
(Why, why, why, why, why) You went away
Yes, I wonder, where you will stay
My little runaway
Run, run, run, run, runaway
Run, run, run, run, runaway
Run, run, run, run, runaway
