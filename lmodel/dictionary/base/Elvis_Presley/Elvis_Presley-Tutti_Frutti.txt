<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="Tutti_Frutti">
A-bop-bop-a-loom-op a-lop-bam-boom !
Tutti Frutti au rutti.
Tutti Frutti au rutti.
Tutti Frutti au rutti.
Tutti Frutti au rutti.
Tutti Frutti au rutti.
A-bop-bop-a-loom-op a-lop-bam-boom !
I got a girl
Her name's Sue -
She knows just what to do.
I got a girl
Her name's Sue -
She knows just what to do.
She rocks to the east -
She rolls to the west.
She's the girl
That I love the best.
Tutti Frutti au rutti...
I got a girl
Her name's Daisy -
She almost drives me crazy.
I got a girl
Her name's Daisy -
She almost drives me crazy.
She knows how to love me
Yes indeed.
Oh boy you don't know
She's doin' to me.
Tutti Frutti au rutti...
Tutti Frutti au rutti...
I got a girl
Her name's Daisy -
She almost drives me crazy.
I got a girl
Her name's Sue -
She know just what to do.
...
Tutti Frutti au rutti...
