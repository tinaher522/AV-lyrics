<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="Walk_A_Mile_In_My_Shoes">
If I could be you, if you could be me
For just one hour
If we could find a way
To get inside each other's mind
If you could see you through my eyes
Instead your own ego
I believe you'd be
I believe you'd be surprised to see
That you've been blind
Walk a mile in my shoes
Just walk a mile in my shoes
Yeah, before you abuse, criticize and accuse
Then walk a mile in my shoes
Now if we spend the day
Throwin' stones at one another
'Cause I don't think, 'cause I don't think
Or wear my hair the same way you do
Well, I may be common people
But I'm your brother
And when you strike out
You're tryin' to hurt me
It's hurtin' you, Lord have mercy
Walk a mile in my shoes
Walk a mile in my shoes
Yeah, before you abuse, criticize and accuse
Walk a mile in my shoes
Now there are people on reservations
And out in the ghetto
And brother, there but for the grace of God
Go you and I
If I only had wings of a little angel
Don't you know I'd fly
To the top of a mountain
And then I'd cry, cry, cry
Walk a mile in my shoes
Walk a mile in my shoes
Yeah, before you abuse, criticize and accuse
Walk a mile in my shoes
Walk a mile in my shoes
Walk a mile in my shoes
Yeah, before you abuse, criticize and accuse
Walk a mile in my shoes
