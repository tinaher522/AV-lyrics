<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="White_Christmas">
I'm dreaming of a white christmas,
Just like the ones I used to know.
Where those tree-tops glisten,
And children listen
To hear sleighbells in the snow.
I'm dreaming of a white christmas,
With every christmas card I write,
May your days be merry and bright,
And may all your christmases be white.
I'm dreaming of a white christmas,
Just like the ones I used to know.
May your days may your days may your days be merry and bright,
And may all your christmases be white.
