<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="My_Babe">
Well, my babe don't stand no cheating, my babe
Well, my babe don't stand no cheating, my babe
You know, my babe don't stand no cheating
She don't, she don't, she don't, oh, God
My babe, I know she loves me, my babe
Well, my babe, I know she loves me, my babe
Well, my babe, I know she loves me, my babe
Well, my babe, I know she loves me
She don't do nothing but kiss and love me
My babe, I know she loves me, my babe
