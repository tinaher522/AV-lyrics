<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="Spring_Fever">
(Spring fever, love is in the air)
A little bird, he told me so
He said, "Come on, get on the go
Open your eyes the sky is full of butterflies."
The blossoms on the trees
Stir up the honey bees
Spring makes my fever right (Spring fever)
(Spring fever), spring is here at last
(Spring fever) my heart's beating fast
(There is no doubt now, love is in the air)
Get up, get out, spring is everywhere
Well if you feel the wanderlust
Just grab a car or hop a bus
In every town there's excitement to be found
So much is happening
Don't miss the joy of spring
The world's in love just look around (Spring fever)
(Spring fever) comes to everyone
(Spring fever) it's time for fun
(There is no doubt now, love is in the air)
Get up, get out, spring is everywhere
Spring fever, it's spring fever time
Spring fever, watch that fever climb
(There is no doubt now love is in the air)
Get up, get out spring is everywhere
Spring is everywhere
(Ah)
