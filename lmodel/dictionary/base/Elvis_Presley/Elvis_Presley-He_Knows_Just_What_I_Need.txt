<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="He_Knows_Just_What_I_Need">
My Jesus knows when I am lonely
He knows each pain, he sees each care
He understands each lonely heartache
He understands because he cares
My Jesus knows just what I need
Oh yes! He knows just what I need
He satisfies and every need supplies
Yes, he knows just what I need
My Jesus knows just what I need
Oh yes! He knows just what I need
He satisfies and every need supplies
Yes, he knows just what I need
