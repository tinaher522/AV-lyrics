<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="Seperate_Ways">
I see a change is coming to our lives
It's not the same as it used to be
And it's not too late to realize our mistake
We're just not right for each other
Love has slipped away, left us only friends
We almost seem like strangers
All that's left between us are the memories we shared
Of times we thought we cared for each other
There's nothing left to do but go our separate ways
And pick up all the pieces left behind us
And maybe someday, somewhere along the way
Another love will find us
Some day when she's older maybe she will understand
Why her mom and dad are not together
The tears that she will cry when I have to say goodbye
Will tear at my heart forever
There's nothing left to do but go our separate ways
And pick up all the pieces left behind us
And maybe someday, somewhere along the way
Another love will find us
