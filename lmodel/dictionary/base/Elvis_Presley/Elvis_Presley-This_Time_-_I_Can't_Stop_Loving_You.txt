<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="This_Time_-_I_Can't_Stop_Loving_You">
I'll just jump in there whenever I get the chance
I think I forgot to wear my cup
That's just my way of loving you
This time we're really breaking up
I know I forgot to wear my cup
Daa da dum 
Those happy hours that we once knew
So apart still make me blue
I know that time heals a broken heart
But time has stood still since we've been apart
I can't stop loving you
I said I made up my mind
To live in memory of a lonesome time
I can't stop wanting you
Its useless to say
So I'll just live my life
In dreams of yesterday
Those happy hours that we once knew
So long ago you know they still make be blue
They say that time heals a broken heart
But time has stood still since we've been apart
I can't stop loving you
I said I made up my mind
To live in memory of a lonesome time
I can't stop wanting you
Its useless to say
So I'll just live my life
In dreams of yesterday
Mmmmm my life in dreams of yesterday
