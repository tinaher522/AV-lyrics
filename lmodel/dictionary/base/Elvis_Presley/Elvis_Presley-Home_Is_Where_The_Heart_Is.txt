<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="Home_Is_Where_The_Heart_Is">
Home is where the heart is
And my heart is anywhere you are
Anywhere you are is home
I don't need a mansion on a hill
That overlooks the sea
Anywhere you're with me is home
Maybe I'm a rolling stone
Who won't amount to much
But everything that I hold dear
Is close enough to touch
For home is where the heart is
And my heart is anywhere you are
Anywhere you are is home
Maybe I'm a rolling stone
Who won't amount to much
But everything that I hold dear
Is close enough to touch
For home is where the heart is
And my heart is anywhere you are
Anywhere you are is home
Home, home, home, home, home
