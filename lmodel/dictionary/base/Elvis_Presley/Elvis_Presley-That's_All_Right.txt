<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="That's_All_Right">
Well, that's all right, mama
That's all right with you
That's all right, mama, just anyway you do
Well, that's all right, that's all right
That's all right now, mama, anyway you do
Well, Mama, she done told me
Papa done told me too
Son, that gal your foolin' with
She ain't no good for you
But that's all right, that's all right
That's all right now, mama, anyway you do
I'm leaving town, baby
I'm leaving town for sure
Well, then you won't be bothered 
With me hanging 'round your door
Well, that's all right, that's all right
That's all right now, mama, anyway you do
Ah da-da dee dee dee-dee
Dee dee dee-dee, dee dee dee-dee
I need your lovin', that's all right
That's all right now, mama, anyway you do
