<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="You_Can_Have_Her">
[Chorus]
You can have her
I don't want her
She didn't love me anyway
She only wanted
Someone to play with
All I wanted was love to stay
Life without love
It's mighty empty
But confession is
Good for the soul
I'd rather have love
That I can cling to
Than have the world
And all of its gold
[Chorus]
If you get the wrong woman
There's only one thing
That you can do
Just dig a hole
Jump right in
And pull the ground
Right over you
[Chorus: x2]
Yeah, oh, God
[Chorus: x2]
