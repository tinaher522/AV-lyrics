<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="When_God_Dips_His_Love_In_My_Heart">
When God dips His pen of love in my heart
And writes my soul a message, He wants me to know
His Spirit, all divine, fills this sinful soul of mine
When God Dips His Love In My Heart.
Well, I said I wouldn't tell it to a livin' soul
