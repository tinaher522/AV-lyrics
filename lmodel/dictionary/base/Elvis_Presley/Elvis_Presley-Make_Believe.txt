<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="Make_Believe">
We couldn't make believe
lala la make believe
But your love dear 
Lala could pretending couldn't you
Couldn't I, couldn't we
Make believe our lips are blended
In a special kiss
For to love me miles away
Make believe I love you
For to tell my true, I do
