<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="Turn_Your_Eyes_Upon_Jesus_-_Nearer_My_God_To_Thee">
Hmmm...
And all the world go free
Now there's a cross for everyone
And there's a cross for me
Turn your eyes upon Jesus
(where are the words) wonder proclaim
And the paint upon the wall
Will go straightÂ ??
In the light of his wonderful face
Nearer my God thee
Nearer to thee
?? the cross
???????? me
Nearer my God to thee
Nearer my God to thee
Nearer my God to thee
Nearer to thee
