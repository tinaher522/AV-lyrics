<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="You're_The_Reason_I'm_Living">
You're the reason I'm livin'
Oh, you carry me through
All of life's little burdens
I'd be lost without you
You're the reason I do things
You're the things that I do
You're the reason I'm livin'
I'd be lost without you
A long, long time ago
When I was down
Oh, dear, you took me in and showed me
True love still could be found
You're the reason I do things
You're the things that I do
You're the reason I'm livin'
I'd be lost without you
You're the reason I'm livin'
I'd be lost without you
You're the reason I'm livin'
I'd be lost without you
