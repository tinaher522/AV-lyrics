<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="There's_No_Place_Like_Home">
There's no place like home
Well I say now home, home sweet home
There's no place like home
Wherever you wander
There's no place like home
Well I used to have a sweetheart
To walk and talk with me
But now I have no sweetheart
What pleasure do I see
There's no place like home
Well I say now home, home sweet home
There's no place like home
Wherever you wander
There's no place like home
There's no place like home
