<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="What's_She_Really_Like_-_Alternate_Take_7">
What's she really like the girl that you see me with
What's she really like the one I'm so dreamy with
Well, let me tell you she's wonderful
She's marvelous and she's mine
Talk about her lips, her lips are so thrill able
Can't describe her kiss in words of one syllable
She's even more than adorable
And what's more able, she's all mine
You're asking if she loves me
Well, you don't know the half
You're wondering if she'll leave me
Ha, ha, ha, don't make me laugh
What's she really like the girl I go on about
What's she really like the one I'm so gone about
All I can say, she's wonderful
She's marvelous and she's mine
You're asking if she loves me
Well, you don't know the half
You're wondering if she'll leave me
Ha, ha, ha, don't make me laugh
What's she really like the girl I go on about
What's she really like the one I'm so gone about
All I can say, she's wonderful
She's marvelous and she's mine
Adorable and she's mine
She's marvelous and she's mine
She's wonderful and she's mine
