<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="Why_Me_Lord">
(Why Me Lord? What have I ever done
To deserve even one
Of the pleasures I've known
Tell me Lord what did I ever do
To deserve loving you
And the kindness you've shown)
Lord heavenly Jesus I praise Him
So help me Jesus, I know what I am
Now that I know that I needed you so
Help me Jesus, my soul's in your hands
(Try me Lord, if you think there's a way
I can ever repay
All I've taken from you
Forgive Lord I can show someone else
What I've been through myself
On my way back to you)
Lord heavenly Jesus I praise Him
So help me Jesus I know what I am, oh yes
Now that I know that I needed you so
Help me Jesus, my soul's in your hands
Jesus my soul's in your hands
