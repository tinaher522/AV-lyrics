<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="Softly_And_Tenderly">
Softly and tenderly jesus is calling,
Calling for you and for me.
Patient and loving he's waiting and watching;
Watching for you and for me.
Come home, come home,
Ye who are weary come home;
Earnestly, tenderly, jesus is calling;
Calling, "o sinner, come home!"
Come home, come home,
Ye who are weary come home;
Earnestly, tenderly, jesus is calling;
Calling, "o sinner, come home!"
Why should we linger when jesus is pleading,
Pleading for you and for me? 
Why should we wait, then, and heed not his mercies;
Mercies for you and for me? 
Come home, come home,
Ye who are weary come home;
Earnestly, tenderly, jesus is calling;
Calling, "o sinner, come home!"
O for the wonderful love he has promised,
Promised for you and for me.
Though we have sinned he has mercy and pardon;
Pardon for you and for me.
Come home, come home,
Ye who are weary come home;
Earnestly, tenderly, jesus is calling;
Calling, "o sinner, come home!"
