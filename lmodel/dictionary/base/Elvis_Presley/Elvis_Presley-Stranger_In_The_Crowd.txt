<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="Stranger_In_The_Crowd">
I'd been standing on the corner
Since a quarter after seven
I was down to my last cigarette
And the clock in the window
Had it quarter to eleven
I was watching all the people
Passing by me, going places
Just the loneliest guy in the town
Looking for a friendly smile
But all that I could see were faces
And then, just like the taste of milk and honey
I found the stranger I'd been looking for
The way my cup of love was overflowing
I knew the stranger in the crowd 
And I would be strangers no more
Love that found us on the corner
At a quarter to eleven
I thought you were to good to be true
All my life I had believed 
That angels only live in heaven
But now, we share the taste of milk and honey
Each day is sweeter than the day before
My cup of love is overflowing 
because the stranger in the crowd
And I would be strangers no more
Deep inside, my cup of love was overflowing
I found the stranger I'd been looking for
THe way my cup of love was overflowing
I knew the stranger in the crowd
And I would be strangers no more
