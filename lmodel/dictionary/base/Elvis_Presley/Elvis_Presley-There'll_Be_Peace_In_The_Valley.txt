<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="There'll_Be_Peace_In_The_Valley">
Oh well, I'm tired and so weary but I must go alone
Till the Lord comes and calls, calls me away, oh yes
Well, the morning's so bright and the lamp is alight
And the night, the night is as black as the sea, oh yes
There will be peace in the valley for me, someday
There will be peace in the valley for me, oh Lord I pray
There'll be no sadness, no sorrow, no trouble, trouble I see
There will be peace in the valley for me
Well, the bear will be gentle and the wolves will be tame
And the lion shall lay down by the lamb, oh yes
And the beasts from the wild shall be lit by a child
And I'll be changed, changed from this creature that I am, oh yes
There will be peace in the valley for me, someday
There will be peace in the valley for me, oh Lord I pray
There'll be no sadness, no sorrow, oh my God and no trouble, trouble I see
There will be peace in the valley for me, for me
