<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="Lady_Madonna">
See how they run
Lady Madonna, children at your feet
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet
Saturday morning arrives without a suitcase
Sunday morning creep in like a nun
Friday's child forget to tie his suitcase
See how they run
Lady Madonna, children at your feet
Wonder if you're having fun making ends meet
