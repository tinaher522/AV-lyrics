<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="San_Antonio_Rose">
... remember alone in my heart
Call back my love of San Antonio
Just pretend like tales fall apart
Think once again of my love, my own 
A few words not known .... my heart I belong...
I don't know... of my rose in San Antonio
Growing all this tender lala heart
Call back my love in San Antonio
It's so sweet and tender like peddles fall apart...
Rose in San Antonio... know my rose in San Antonio
