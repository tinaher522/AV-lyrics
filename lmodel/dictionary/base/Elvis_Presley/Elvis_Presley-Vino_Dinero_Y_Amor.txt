<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="Vino_Dinero_Y_Amor">
Viva el vino, viva el dinero
Viva, viva
El amor
I like to drink wine, and money is fine
But I like the girls even more
Viva el vino, viva el dinero
Viva, viva el amor
Some pesos you pass, put wine in her glass
And soon she will say si senor
Viva el vino, viva el dinero
Viva, viva el amor
With wine on your lips and money in your pocket
And your sweetheart in your arms
You're rich as you can be
So lift up your glass, let's sing it all together
Muchachas, caballeros
Make this toast with me
We'll drink one more time, with money and wine
Let's drink to the girls we adore
Viva el vino, viva el dinero
Viva, viva el amor
Sing one more time, money and wine
Let's sing to the girls we adore
(Viva el vino, viva el dinero)
Viva, viva el amor
