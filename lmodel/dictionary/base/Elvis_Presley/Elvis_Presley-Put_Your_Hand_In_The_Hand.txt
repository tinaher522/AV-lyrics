<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="Put_Your_Hand_In_The_Hand">
Put your hand in the hand of the man
Who stilled the water (stilled the water)
Put your hand in the hand of the man
Who calmed the sea (calmed the sea)
Take a look at yourself
And you can look at others differently
Put your hand in the hand of the man
From Galilee, woah yeah
My mama taught me how to pray
Before I reached the age of seven
When I'm down on my knees
That's when I'm closest to heaven
Daddy lived his life, two kids and a wife
Well you do what you must do
But he showed me enough of what it takes
To get me through, oh yeah
Put your hand in the hand of the man
Who stilled the water (stilled the water)
Put your hand in the hand of the man
Who calmed the sea (calmed the sea)
Take a look at yourself
And you can look at others differently
Put your hand in the hand of the man
From Galilee, woah yeah
Put your hand in the hand of the man
Who stilled the water (stilled the water)
Put your hand in the hand of the man
Who calmed the sea (calmed the sea)
Take a look at yourself
And you can look at others differently
Put your hand in the hand of the man
From Galilee, woah yeah
Put your hand in the hand of the man
Who stilled the water (stilled the water)
Put your hand in the hand of the man
Who calmed the sea (calmed the sea)
Take a look at yourself
And you can look at others differently
Put your hand in the hand of the man
From Galilee, woah yeah
Put your hand in the hand of the man
From Galilee, woah yeah
Put your hand in the hand of the man
From Galilee, woah yeah
