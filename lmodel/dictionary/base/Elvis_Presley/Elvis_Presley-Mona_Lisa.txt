<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="Mona_Lisa">
Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa, man have named you
You're so like the lady with the mystic smile
Is it only 'cause you're lonely man have blamed you
For that Mona Lisa strangeness in your smile
Do you smile to tempt a lover Mona Lisa
Or is it your way to hide a broken heart
Many dreams have been brought to your doorstep
They just lie there and they die there
Are you warm, are you real Mona Lisa
Or just a cold and lonely lovely work of art
La la la la......
For that Mona Lisa strangeness in your smile
Do you smile to tempt a lover Mona Lisa
Or is it your way to hide a broken heart
Many dreams have been brought to your doorstep
They just lie there and they die there
Are you warm, are you real Mona Lisa
Or just a cold and lonely lovely work of art
