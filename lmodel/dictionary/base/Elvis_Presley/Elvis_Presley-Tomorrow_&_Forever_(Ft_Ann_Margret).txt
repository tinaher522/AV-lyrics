<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="Tomorrow_&_Forever_(Ft_Ann_Margret)">
Oh, the neons are a gleamin' and the gamblers are a dreamin'
Oh, it's night life, yeah, night life
The chips are a spillin' and it's time to make a killin'
Oh, it's night life, yeah, night life
Oh, the pockets are a-burnin' and the money flies
With dice roll a-turnin' and you'll hit snakes eyes
You can't be a quitter when you're caught up in the glitter of
Night life, night life
There're long-legged women who will take you for a trimmin'
Yes, it's night life, oh, night life
Their lips taste like honey, but they're out to spend your money
Yes, it's night life, oh, yeah
Just roll that seven and you'll hear them shriek
When seven come eleven, it's a lucky streak
You can't beat the drama, the excitement, and the glamor
Of the night life, I said, that night life
So place your bet, come on, make your play
Though you may regret it at the break of day
I said you can't be a quitter when you're caught up in the glitter of
Night life, night life
Yeah, that night life, good old night life
Night life, yes, yes, night life, oh, night life
