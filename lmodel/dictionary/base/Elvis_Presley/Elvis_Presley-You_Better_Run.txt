<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="You_Better_Run">
(Well now you'd better run)
Run when I say, somebody's calling you
You'd better run
Run when I say, (somebody's calling you)
You'd better run
Run when I say, (somebody's calling you)
I feel like my time has long gone
Long gone, (my time is long gone)
Well now goodbye false pretender
Lord I cannot wait for you
For the bible declares you're goin' to heaven Lord
What the bible declares you do
(Well now you'd better run)
Run when I say, somebody's calling you
You'd better run
Run when I say, (somebody's calling you)
You'd better run
Run when I say, (somebody's calling you)
I feel like my time has long gone
Long gone, (my time is long gone)
Long gone
Well I met a false pretender
Whose head was bending Lord
I met him in the evening
He was headed down that long lonesome road
(Well now you'd better run)
Run when I say, somebody's calling you
You'd better run
Run when I say, (somebody's calling you)
You'd better run
Get away from here, somebody's calling you
I feel like my time has long gone
Long gone, (my time is long gone), long gone
