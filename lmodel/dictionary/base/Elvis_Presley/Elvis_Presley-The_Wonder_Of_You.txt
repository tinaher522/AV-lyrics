<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="The_Wonder_Of_You">
When no one else can understand me
When everything I do is wrong
You give me love and consolation
You give me hope to carry on
And you're always there
To lend a hand
In everything I do
That's the wonder, the wonder of you
And when you smile, the world is brighter
You touch my hand and I'm a king
Your love to me is worth a fortune
Your love for me is everything
I guess I'll never know
The reason why
You love me as you do
That's the wonder, the wonder of you
I guess I'll never know
The reason why
You love me as you do
That's the wonder, the wonder of you
