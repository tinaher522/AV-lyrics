<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="Sweet_Angeline">
Sweet angeline I loved you much more than poets say in rhyme
Just for one short time
Sweet angeline remember though we've not seen the summer through
I lived only for you
I'm only human and I realize it's no use trying to disguise
My love for you angeline has ended
So let's be thankful now not sad
For the little love we've had
Sweet angeline remember though we've not seen the summer through
I lived only for you
I'm only human and I realize it's no use trying to disguise
My love for you angeline has ended
So let's be thankful now not sad
For the little love we've had
