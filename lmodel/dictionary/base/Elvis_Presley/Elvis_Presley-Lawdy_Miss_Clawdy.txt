<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="Lawdy_Miss_Clawdy">
Well lawdy, lawdy, lawdy Miss Clawdy
Girl You sure look good to me
Well please don't excite me baby
I know it can't be me
Because I give you all of my money
Yeah, but you just won't treat me right
You like to ball every morning
Don't come home til late at night
I'm gonna tell, tell my momma
Lord I swear to God what you been doing to me
I'm gonna tell everybody
That I'm down in misery
So bye, bye bye baby
Girl I won't be coming no more
Goodbye little darling
Down the road I go
