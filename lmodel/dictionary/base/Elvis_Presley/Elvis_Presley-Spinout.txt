<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="Spinout">
When her motor's warm and she's purrin' sweet
Buddy let me warn ya', you're on a one-way street
She'll crowd ya' close, spin your wheels
Then you're gonna know how it feels
To spinout, yeah, spinout
Better watch those curves, never let her steer
If she can shake your nerves, boy, then she can strip your gears
She'll get your heart goin' fast
Then she'll let you run out of gas
So spinout, spinout
The road to love is full of
Danger signs
Too many guys were lost
Who crossed those double lines
Don'tcha know she's out to prove, she can really score
Never saw parts move, boy, like that before
To flag you down, that's her goal
Scoot before you lose control
And spinout, yeah, spinout
The road to love is full of
Danger signs
Too many guys were lost
Who crossed those double lines
Don'tcha know she's out to prove, she can really score
Never saw parts move, boy, like that before
To flag you down, that's her goal
Scoot before you lose control
And spinout, yeah, spinout, spinout, all right
