<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="Ku-u-i-po_(Hawaiian_Sweetheart)">
Ku-u-i-po, I love you more today
More today than yesterday
But I love you less today
Less than I will tomorrow
See the sweet hawaiian rose
See it blossom, see it grow
That's the story of our love
Ever since we said hello
Ku-u-i-po, I love you more today
More today than yesterday
But I love you less today
Less than I will tomorrow
As the years go passing by
We'll recall our wedding day
I will be there by your side
You will always hear me say
Ku-u-i-po, I love you more today
More today than yesterday
But I love you less today
Less than I will tomorrow
Ku-u-i-po, you're my hawaiian sweetheart
