<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="On_A_Snowy_Christmas_Night">
Midnights prayers so softly whispered in
A Cathedral's candle light
Bring the message of the holidays
On a snowy Christmas night
Holly reeds and hidden mistletoe
Symbols of the seasons might
Joyful faces everywhere you go
On a snowy Christmas night
Give thanks for all you've been blessed with
And hold your loved ones tight
For you know the Lord's been good to you
On a snowy Christmas night
Mother Nature wears a bridal gown
For the world is dressed in white
There's a silent glow that fills the earth
On a snowy Christmas night
For you know the Lord's been good to you
On a snowy Christmas night
