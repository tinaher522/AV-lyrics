<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="When_The_Saints_Go_Marchin'_In_-_1956_Home_Recording">
Well, when the saints go marchin' in
Well, when the saints go marchin in
Oh Lord, I want to be in that number
When the saints go marchin' in
When the sun refuse to shine
Well, when the sun refuse to shine
Oh Lord, I want to be in that number
When the sun refuse to shine
Well, when the saints go marchin' in
Well, when the saints go marchin in
Oh Lord, I want to be in that number
When the saints go marchin' in
Well, when the saints go marchin' in
Well, when the saints go marchin in
Oh Lord, I want to be in that number
When the saints go marchin' in
