<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="Fountain_Of_Love">
One thought of you, 
My heart begins churning
I feel return 
To a fountain of love
My lips and eyes, 
They ache to be near you
To hold you here 
In my fountain of love
Never be blue 
Should your world start sinking
Just come and drink 
From my fountain of love
We'll build a new world off 
On a high mountain
We'll live 
On our fountain of love
