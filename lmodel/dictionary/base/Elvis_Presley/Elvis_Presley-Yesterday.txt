<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="Yesterday">
Yesterday
All my troubles seemed so far away
Now it looks as though they're here to stay
Oh, I believe in yesterday
Suddenly (suddenly, ooh)
I'm not half the man I used to be
There's a shadow hanging over me
Oh, yesterday, came suddenly
Why she had to go
I don't know, she wouldn't say
I said something wrong
Now I long for yesterday
Yesterday (yesterday, ooh)
Love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday
Why she had to go
I don't know, she wouldn't say
I said something wrong
Now I long for yesterday
Yesterday (yesterday, ooh)
Love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
