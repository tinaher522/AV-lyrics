<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="You've_Lost_That_Lovin'_Feeling">
You never close your eyes
Anymore when I kiss your lips
There's no tenderness
Like before in you fingertips
You're trying hard not to show it,
But baby, baby I know it
You've lost that lovin' feelin', oh that lovin' feelin'
You've lost that lovin' feelin', now it's gone, gone, gone
There's no tenderness in your eyes
When I reach out for you
Girl, you're starting to criticize
Every little thing I do
It makes me just feel like crying
'cause baby, something beautiful's dying
You've lost that lovin' feelin', oh that lovin' feelin'
You've lost that lovin' feelin', now it's gone, gone, gone
Baby, baby, I get down on my knees for you
If you would only love me like you used to do
We had a love, love, love, love affair every day
Oh don't, don't, don't, don't take it away
Listen to me, talkin' to you
You've lost that lovin' feelin', oh that lovin' feelin'
You've lost that lovin' feelin', now it's gone, gone, gone
And I can't go on
