<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="Where_No_One_Stands_Alone">
Once I stood in the night with my head bowed low
In the darkness as black as could be
And my heart felt alone and I cried,"Oh Lord
Don't hide Your face from me"
Like a king I may live in a palace so tall
With great riches to call my own
But I don't know a thing in this whole wide world
That's worse than being alone
Hold my hand all the way, every hour every day
Come here to the great unknown
Take my hand, let me stand
Where no one stands alone
Take my hand, let me stand
Where no one stands alone
