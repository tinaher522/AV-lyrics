<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="Where_Did_They_Go,_Lord">
The words of her promise
The flame of her faith
The love that would never drift away
Where did they go Lord, where did they go?
You know somehow forever
Slipped out of my hands
And my dreams ran away with the wind
Where did they go Lord, where did they go
You know sometimes I wish
I had lost her to another
Well but Lord she just walked off all alone
And the heart that's within me is not bitter just hurt
And bewildered because her love had gone
Oh the passion I trusted
The truth that I leaned on
And the hope that would forever keep me strong
I cry out my questions
Oh, the answers are all gone
Where did they go Lord, tell me where did they go
Where did they go Lord, tell me where did they go
