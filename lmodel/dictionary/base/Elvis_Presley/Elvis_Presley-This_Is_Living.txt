<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="This_Is_Living">
This is living, full of fun and free
This is living, that's the life for me
It's good to laugh and sing, don't worry about a thing
Wear a happy smile, cut loose and run a mile
If you relax and just enjoy it all, life has got to be a ball
This is living, full of fun and free
This is living, that's the life for me
It wouldn't mean a thing
If I could be a king
I really wouldn't care
To be a millionaire
I'd rather find someone to love a lot
Live and give it all I've got
This is living, full of fun and free
This is living, that's the life for me
Don't wanna settle down
I gotta move around
I gotta lot of time
I'm gonna wait and find
The kinda girl who's heart is restless too
The kind who feels the way I do
This is living, full of fun and free
This is living, that's the life for me
