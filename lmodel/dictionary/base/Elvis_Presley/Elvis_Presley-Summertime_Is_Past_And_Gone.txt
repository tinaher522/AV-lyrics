<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="Summertime_Is_Past_And_Gone">
Summertime is past and gone
I'm on my way back home
Summertime is past and and gone
And I'm on my way back home
To see the only one I ever loved
Now the moon is shining bright
It lights my pathway tonight
Back to the only one I ever loved
Oh I know she waits for me
Back in old Tenneessee
She was sent to me from God above
Now the moon is shining bright
It lights my pathway tonight
Back to the only one I ever loved
Oh I know she waits for me
Back in old Tenneessee
She was sent to me from God above
Now the moon is shining bright
It lights my pathway tonight
Back to the only one I ever loved
