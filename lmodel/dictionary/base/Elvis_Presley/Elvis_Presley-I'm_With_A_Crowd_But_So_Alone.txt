<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="I'm_With_A_Crowd_But_So_Alone">
I'm with a crowd but oh so alone
I still have the picture you sent me
And you signed it with love you recall
And the one of me that you wanted
Is now hanging face to the wall
At night I'm never alone
I'm afraid that I'll weaken and phone
And I'm afraid that you will be gone
I'm with a crowd but oh so alone
