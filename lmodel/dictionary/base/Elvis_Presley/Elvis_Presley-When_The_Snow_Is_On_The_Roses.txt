<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="When_The_Snow_Is_On_The_Roses">
When the snow is on the roses
When the bluebird's flown away
In my arms I will remember
All the love we shared today
When the snow is on the roses
When the bluebird's flown away
In my arms we will remember
All the love we shared today
All the love we shared today
