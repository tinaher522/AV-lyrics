<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="Never_Say_Yes">
Look out now I'm runnin' wild
There ain't no holding back this child
I guess you'd say I'm a son of a gun
Livin' just for a life of fun
Here's the secret of my success
Never say yes, no, no, never say yes
Life has taught me one big lesson
Always keep the girlies guessin'
Tell 'em that you love them so
You hate to leave, but you gotta go
That's the secret of my success
Never say yes, no, no, never say yes
It's the oldest scheme in the world
And you gotta know how to play it
Tell her yes in so many ways
And never ever say it
That's how I keep goin' on
Here today, tomorrow gone
That's the kind of life for me
Being free like I want to be
Here's the secret of my success
Never say yes, no, no, never say yes
It's the oldest scheme in the world
And you gotta know how to play it
Tell her yes in so many ways
And never ever say it
That's how I keep goin' on
Here today, tomorrow gone
That's the kind of life for me
Being free like I want to be
Here's the secret of my success
Never say yes, no, no, never say yes
No, no, never say yes
