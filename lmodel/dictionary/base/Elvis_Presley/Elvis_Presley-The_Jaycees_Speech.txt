<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="The_Jaycees_Speech">
"When I was a child, ladies and gentleman, I was a dreamer. I read comic books, and I was a hero in the movie.So every dream that I ever dreamed has come true a hundred times. I learned very early in life that without a song, the day would never end; without a song, a man ain't got a friend; without a song, the road would never bend; without a song. So I keep singing a song. Goodnight, Thank You".
