<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="Release_Me_(And_Let_Me_Love_Again)">
Oh please release me, let me go
For I just don't love you anymore
To waste our lives would be a sin
Oh, release me and let me love again
Oh, I have found a new love dear
And I will always want her near
Her lips are warm while yours are cold
Oh release me, my darling let me go
Oh please release me, let me go
For I just don't love you anymore
To waste our lives would be a sin
Release me and let me love again
Oh please release me, let me go
For I just don't love you anymore
To waste our lives would be a sin
Oh, release me and let me love again
Let me go, oh release me, my darling
Let me go
(Let me go, let me go)
