<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="Stay_Away">
Ten thousand miles even though I roam
I can hear the call of the hills of home
The canyons high and the valleys low
Echo how can you stay away
My dreams are there where the eagle flies
Where the mountain tops seem to touch the sky
The winding streams and the winds that blow
Ask me how can you stay away
Far too long have I stayed apart
From this land that I love and divide my heart
Now, now I know I must go
Where the hills say don't stay away
Where the hills say don't stay away
