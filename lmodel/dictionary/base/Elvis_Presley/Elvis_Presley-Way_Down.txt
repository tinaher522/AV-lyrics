<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="Way_Down">
Babe, you're getting closer
The lights are goin' dim
The sound of your breathin'
Has made the mood I'm in
All of my resistance
Is lying on the floor
Taking me to places
I've never been before
Ooh, and I can feel it
Feel it, feel it, feel it
Way down where the music plays
(Way down) Way down like a tidal wave
(Way down) Way down where the fires blaze
Way down, down, way, way on down
Ooh, my head is spinnin'
You got me in your spell,
A hundred magic fingers
On a whirling carousel
The medicine within me
No doctor could prescribe
Your love is doing something
That I just can't describe
Ooh, and I can feel it
Feel it, feel it, feel it
Way down where the music plays
(Way down) Way down like a tidal wave
(Way down) Way down where the fires blaze
Way down, down, way, way on down
Hold me again as tight as you can
I need you so, baby, let's go
(Way down) Way down where it feels so good
(Way down) Way down where I hoped it would
(Way down) Way down where I never could
Way down, down, way, way on down
