<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="That's_When_Your_Heartaches_Begin">
If you find your sweetheart
In the arms of a friend
That's when your heartaches begin
When dreams of a lifetime
Must come to an end
That's when your heartaches begin
Love is a thing
You never can share
When you bring a friend
Into your love affair
That's the end of your sweetheart
That's the end of your friend
That's when your heartaches begin
If you find your sweetheart
In the arms of your best friend
Brother, that's, that's when your heartaches begin
And you know, when all of your dreams
when all of your dreams of a lifetime, must, must all come to an end
Yeah that's, yeah that's when your heartaches begin
For you see love is a thing
that, that you never can share
and you know, when you bring a friend
Ah, into your love affair
That's the end of your sweetheart
That's the end of your friend.
That's the when your heartaches begin.
