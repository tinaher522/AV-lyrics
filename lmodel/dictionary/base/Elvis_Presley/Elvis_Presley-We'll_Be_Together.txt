<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="We'll_Be_Together">
Oh, I will never forget the first night we met
Was love I was searching for
My heart beat faster and faster, oh so much faster
Faster than it did before
Juntos estaremos
Siempre por siempre
Junto a mi corazo'n
Siempre estara's
We'll be together and love forever
Nothing can change our destiny
I knew the moment I kissed you, couldn't resist you
Together we belong
And then I knew in that moment just what this glow meant
True love had come along
We'll be together, ever and ever
Close to my heart you'll always be
We'll be together, and love forever
Nothing can change our destiny
