<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="Treat_Me_Nice_-_Mono_Movie_Version">
When I walk through that door
Baby, be polite
You're gonna make me sore
If you don't greet me right
Don't you ever kiss me once
Kiss me twice; treat me nice
I know that you've been told
It's not fair to tease
So if you come on cold
I'm really gonna freeze
If you don't want me to be
Cold as ice, treat me nice
Make me feel at home
If you really care
Scratch my back and run your pretty
Fingers through my hair
You know I'll be your slave
If you ask me to
But if you don't behave
I'll walk right out on you
If you want my love, then take my advice
Treat me nice
Make me feel at home
If you really care
Scratch my back and run your pretty
Fingers through my hair
You know I'll be your slave
If you ask me to
But if you don't behave
I'll walk right out on you
If you want my love, then take my advice
Treat me nice, treat me nice
If you really want my love
Then treat me nice
