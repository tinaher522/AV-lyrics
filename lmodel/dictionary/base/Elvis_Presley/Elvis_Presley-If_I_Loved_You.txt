<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="If_I_Loved_You">
If I loved you
Words wouldn't come in an easy way
Round in circles I'd go
Only to tell you
But afraid and shy
I let my golden chances pass me by
Soon you'll leave me
Ought (?) you would go in a misty day
Never, never let you know
I love you eternally
</song>
