<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="It_Feels_So_Right">
Step in these arms, where you belong
It feels so right, so right
How can it be wrong? 
There's something in the way you kiss
That makes me want to hold you tight
I know that nothing can't be wrong
That feels so right.
Each time we touch, you thrill me so
It means so much, so much
I can't let you go
This isn't only for tonight
We're gonna love our whole life long
'cause baby, if it feels so right
How can it be wrong?
