<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="Five_Sleepy_Heads">
There were five sleepyheads
All tucked into their beds
While I sang a lullaby
One got dream dust in her eye
There were four sleepyheads
Playing possum with me
Mr. sandman came by
And then there were three
Moonbeams play peek-a-boo
Three away became two
And my song was almost done
When the land of nod took one
Kissed the last one goodnight
Then I heard not a peep
There were five sleepyheads
Now they're all fast asleep
