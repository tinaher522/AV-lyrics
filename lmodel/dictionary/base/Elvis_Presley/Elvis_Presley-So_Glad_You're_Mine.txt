<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="So_Glad_You're_Mine">
My baby's long and tall
She's like a cannonball
Say, every time she loves me
Lordly, you can hear me squall
She cried, ooo-wee
I believe I'll change my mind
She said, "I'm so glad I'm living"
I cried, "I'm so glad you're mine"
My baby knows just how
To treat me right
Gives me plenty loving
Morning, noon, and night
She cried, ooo-wee
I believe I'll change my mind
She said, "I'm so glad I'm living"
I cried, "I'm so glad you're mine"
When my baby does what she does to me
I climb the highest mountain
Dive in the deepest sea
She cried, ooo-wee
I believe I'll change my mind
She said, "I'm so glad I'm living"
I cried, "I'm so glad you're mine"
My baby's lips are red
And sweet like wine
And when she kisses me
I get high every time
She cried, ooo-wee
I believe I'll change my mind
She said, "I'm so glad I'm living"
I cried, "I'm so glad you're mine"
