<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="Only_Believe">
Lordy only believe
Only believe
All things are possible
If you'll only believe
My Lordy, only believe
Yes, only believe
All things are possible
If you'll only believe
I met God one morning
My soul feeling bad
Heart heavy-laden
I felt fire doubt ahead
Well He lifted all my burdens
Yeah, right now I'm feeling glad
All things are possible
If you'll only believe
I believe
Yeah, I believe
All things are possible
If you'll only believe
