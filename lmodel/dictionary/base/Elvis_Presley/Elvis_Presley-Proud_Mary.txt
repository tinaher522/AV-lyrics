<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="Proud_Mary">
Left a good job in the city
Workin' for the man every night and day
And I never lost one minute of sleeping
Worried about the way things might have been
A big wheel keeps on turnin'
Proud Mary keeps on burnin'
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on a river
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on a river
If you come down to the river
Betcha you're gonna find some people who live 
You don't have to worry 'cause you have no money
People on the river are happy to give
I said a big wheel keeps on turnin'
Proud Mary keeps on burnin'
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on a river
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on a river
If you come down to the river
Betcha you're gonna find some people who live 
You don't have to worry 'cause you have no money
People on the river are happy to give
I said a big wheel keeps on turnin'
Proud Mary keeps on burnin'
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on a river
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on a river
