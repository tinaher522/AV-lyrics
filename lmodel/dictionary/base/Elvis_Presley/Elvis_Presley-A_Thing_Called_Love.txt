<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="A_Thing_Called_Love">
Six foot six stood on the ground
Weighed 235 pounds
But I saw that giant of a man brought down
To his knees by love
He was the kind of man who would gamble on love
Look you in the eye and never back up
But I saw him crying like a little whipped pup
Because of love
Can't see it with your eyes, hold it in your hands
Like the rules that govern our land
Strong enough to rule the heart of every man
This thing called love
It can lift you up, it can put you down
Take your world and turn it all around
Ever since time nothing's ever been found
Stronger than love
Men like me they worry and doubt
Trouble their minds day in and day out
Too busy with your livin' to worry
About a thing called love
But then I see a mother's tenderness
As she holds her young close to her breast
Then I say thank God this world will win
With the thing called love
Can't see it with your eyes, hold it in your hands
Like the rules that govern our land
Strong enough to rule the heart of every man
This thing called love
It can lift you up, it can put you down
Take your world and turn it all around
Ever since time nothing's ever been found
Stronger than love
