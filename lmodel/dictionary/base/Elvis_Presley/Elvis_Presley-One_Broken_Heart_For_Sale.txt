<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="One_Broken_Heart_For_Sale">
Who wants to buy a heart
One broken lover's heart
One broken heart for sale
Well, excuse me if you see me crying like a baby
Since she rejected me
There's nothing left to save me
Hey Cupid, where are you?
My heart is growing sadder
That girl rejected me
Just when I thought I had her
She would not listen to the things my heart was saying
She turned and walked away
And told me I was playing
Some guys have all the luck
And my heart hasn't any
I think I'll paint a sign
For sale for a penny
