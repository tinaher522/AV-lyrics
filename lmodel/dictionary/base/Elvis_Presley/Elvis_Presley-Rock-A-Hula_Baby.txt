<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="Rock-A-Hula_Baby">
Rock-a-hula, Rock-Rock-a-hula
Rock-a-hula, Rock-Rock-a-hula
Rock-a-hula, Rock-Rock-a-hula
Rock-a-hula, Rock-Rock-a-hula
Rock-a-hula, Rock-Rock-a-hula
Rock-a-hula, Rock
The way she moves her hips to her fingertips
I feel I'm heaven bound
And when she starts to sway, I've gotta say
She really move the grass around
Rock-a-hula baby
Rock-a-hula baby
Got a hula lulu from Honolulu
That rock-a-hula baby of mine
Rock-a-hula, Rock-Rock-a-hula
Rock-a-hula, Rock
Although I love to kiss my little hula miss
I never get the chance
I wanna hold her tight all through the night
But all she wants to do is dance
Rock-a-hula baby
Rock-a-hula baby
Got a hula lulu from Honolulu
That rock-a-hula baby of mine
Rock-a-hula baby
Rock-a-hula baby
Got a hula lulu from Honolulu
That rock-a-hula baby of mine
Rock-a-hula baby of mine
