<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="You're_The_Only_Star_In_My_Blue_Heaven">
You're the only star in my blue heaven
And I'm waiting just for you
You're the only star in my blue heaven
And in dreams your face I see
Well you're the guiding light
That brightens up the night
And I see your face in my dreams
You're the only star in my blue heaven
And I'm waiting just for you
