<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="One-Sided_Love_Affair">
If you want to be loved,
Baby, you've got to love me, too.
If you want to be loved,
Baby, you've got to love me, too.
Oh yeah, 'cause I ain't for no one-sided love affair.
If you wanna be kissed,
Well, you've gotta kiss me, too.
Oh yeah, if you wanna be kissed,
Well, you gotta kiss me, too.
'cause I ain't for no one-sided love affair.
Well, in a fair exchange there's no robbery,
And the whole world will know that it's true.
Understanding solves all problems, baby,
That's why I'm telling you
If you wanna be hugged,
Well, you gotta hug me, too.
Oh yeah, if you wanna be hugged,
Well, you've gotta hug me, too.
Yeah, 'cause I ain't for no one-sided love affair.
If you know you can't take it,
Baby, why try to give it? 
If you know you can't take it,
Then baby, why try to give it? 
'cause I ain't for no one-sided love affair.
Well, in a fair exchange there's no robbery,
And the whole world will know that it's true.
Understanding solves all problems, baby,
That's why I'm telling you
If you wanna be hugged,
Well, you gotta hug me, too.
Oh yeah, if you wanna be hugged,
Baby, you gotta hug me, too.
'cause I ain't for no one-sided love affair.
'cause I ain't for no one-sided love affair.
'cause I ain't for no one-sided love affair.
