<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="Wolf_Call">
Flip, flop a-kay-eye
What a cutie pie I see, (yeah yeah)
Oops shoopa doo-wah
Lips of honey that's for me (yeah yeah)
Shim sham shimmie
Wanna howl and shout
I might forget you baby
There's no doubt
I saw you standing 'gainst the wall (wall)
I whistled and I gave my all (all)
Now don't tell me you don't fall
For that wolf call
Just a little kiss'll put me in a whirl
I'll never whistle dearie at another girl
You love me well we'll have a ball (ball)
Why do you try to stall (stall)
Now don't tell me you don't fall
For that wolf call
For that wolf call
For that wolf call
