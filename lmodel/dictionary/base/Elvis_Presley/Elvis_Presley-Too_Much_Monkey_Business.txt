<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="Too_Much_Monkey_Business">
Salesman talking to me tried to run me up a creek
Says you can buy it, go on try it, you can pay me next week
Uh-uh, too much monkey business, too much monkey business
Too much monkey business for me to be involved in
Blonde haired, good lookin' tryin' to get me hooked
Wants me to marry, settle down and get a home and and write a book
Uh-uh, too much monkey business, too much monkey business
Too much monkey business for me to be involved in
Pay phone, somethin' wrong, dime gone,
Well me ought to sue the operator for tellin' me a tale
Uh-uh, too much monkey business, too much monkey business
Too much monkey business for me to be involved in
Been to Vietnam, been a fightin' in the war
Army bar, army chow, army clothes, army car
Uh-uh, too much monkey business, too much monkey business
Too much monkey business for me to be involved in
Workin' in the fillin' station, too many tasks
Wipe the windo', check the tires, check the oil, dole the gas
Uh-uh, too much monkey business, too much monkey business
Too much monkey business for me to be involved in
Blonde haired, good lookin' tryin' to get me hooked
Wants me to marry, get a home, settle down and and write a book
Uh-uh, too much monkey business, too much monkey business
Too much monkey business for me to be involved in
Too much monkey business, too much monkey business,
Too much monkey business, too much monkey business,
Too much monkey business, too much monkey business,
