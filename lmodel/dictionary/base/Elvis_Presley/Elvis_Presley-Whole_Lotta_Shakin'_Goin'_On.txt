<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="Whole_Lotta_Shakin'_Goin'_On">
I said come on over baby,
A-whole lotta shakin' goin' on
Yeah I said come on over baby,
A-whole lotta shakin' goin' on
Well we ain't fakin',
A-whole lotta shakin' goin' on
Mmm, I said come on over baby,
We got chicken in the barn
Whose barn, what barn, my barn
Come on over baby,
We got the bull by the horns
Yeah, we ain't fakin',
A-whole lotta shakin' goin' on
Well, I said shake baby, shake
I said shake, baby shake now
I said shake it baby, shake it
I said shake it baby, shake
We ain't fakin',
A-whole lotta shakin' goin' on
Well, I said come on over baby,
A-whole lot-ta shakin' goin' on
I said come on over baby,
A-whole lotta shakin' goin' on
Well we ain't fakin',
A-whole lotta shakin' goin' on
Well my mom-mom-mom,
I said shake it baby, shake it
I said shake it baby, shake it
I said shake it baby, shake all right
I said shake it baby, shake it
We ain't fakin',
A-whole lotta shakin' goin' on
