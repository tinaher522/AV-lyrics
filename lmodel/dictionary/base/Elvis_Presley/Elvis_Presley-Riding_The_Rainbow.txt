<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="Riding_The_Rainbow">
I'm riding the rainbow, hitting the highway to happiness
Oh yes, I'm looking to find someone whose meant to be mine
I'm living to love
and loving to live
I've got a heart
I'm longing to give
I'm riding the rainbow, I'll follow that star to where you are
I'm riding the rainbow, heading for heaven and happiness
I guess somebody somewhere, someday will teach me to care
But being alone, 
don't bother me
I'm free to have fun
It's fun to be free
I'm riding the rainbow, I'll follow that star 
I'm riding the rainbow to where you are
