<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="It's_No_Secret_(What_God_Can_Do)">
The chimes of time ring out the news--another day is through
Someone slipped and fell; was that someone you?
You may have longed for added strength your courage to renew
Just do not be disheartened; for I bring hope to you
It is no secret what God can do
What He's done for others He can for you
With arms wide open He'll pardon you
It is no secret what God can do
