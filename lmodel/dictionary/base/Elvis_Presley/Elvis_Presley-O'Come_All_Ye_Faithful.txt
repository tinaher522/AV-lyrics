<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="O'Come_All_Ye_Faithful">
O' come all ye faithful
Joyful and triumphant
O' come ye, o' come ye to Bethlehem
Come and behold Him
Born the King of angels
O' come let us adore Him
O' come let us adore Him
O' come let us adore Him
Christ, the Lord
Sing choirs of angels
Sing in exaltation
Oh, sing all ye rivals
Of heaven above
Glory to God, glory in the highest
O' come let us adore Him
O' come let us adore Him
O' come let us adore Him
Christ, the Lord
