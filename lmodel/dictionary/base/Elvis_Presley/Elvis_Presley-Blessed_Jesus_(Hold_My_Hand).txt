<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="Blessed_Jesus_(Hold_My_Hand)">
... mm, stepping through the sinking sand
To the cross of Calvary
Mm, let it be my prayer, dear Lord, each day
To help me do the best I can
For there is no friend on whom I can depend
Blessed Jesus, hold my hand.
Blessed Jesus, hold my hand ...
Oh, yes, I need Thee every hour
Through the this pilgrims land
Protect me by thy saving power
Please, hear my feeble plea
Oh, hoh, Lord, please, tell me 
I kneel in prayer, I try to meet you there
Blessed Jesus, hold my hand, hold my hand.
