<song artist="Elvis_Presley" title="Sentimental_Me">
Sentimental me
Guess I'll always will be
So in love with you
Say you love me too
Sentimental me
Dreaming while I live
Living just to give
All my love to you
No one else will do
Sentimental me
Reaching for the moon
Wishing on the stars
On my honeymoon
I want to be where you are
Darling can't you see
It was meant to be
I'm in love with you
Say you love me too
Sentimental me
Darling can't you see
It was meant to be
I'm in love with you
No-one else will do
