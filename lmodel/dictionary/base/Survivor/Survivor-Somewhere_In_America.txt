Somewhere...
**Hey girl. help me if you can
I'm coming to you with my heart in my hand
Give me love, I'm starved for affection
All I need is just a little direction**
* Wow
Somewhere in America, 
somewhere cross the sea
Somewhere in America, 
she waits for me*
I need a teacher who can use a pet
Give me a lesson in etiquette
If there is anyone who'd like to try
Maybe she'd like to come and teach me tonight
(* Repeat)
Same old story, same old song and dance
What good is the glory, if you can't find romance
I know she is waiting
Ooh, somewhere in the heartland
And if she's out there tonight
I wish she would raise her hand
(**Repeat) 
(*Repeat)
Somewhere in America....
