<song artist="Survivor" title="Love_Is_On_My_Side">
So strange when lovers change their mind
To realize the joy left foolishly behind
I feel secure down in my soul
*(Somehow I know)
I know that love is on my side
(Deep down I know) 
I know that love is on my side
I'm gonna win, yeah*
Some nights I slip into the past
To better understand why two hearts never last
I just don't know why nights so tender turn so cold
( * Repeat)
Walk on, through the night
it's all just a game she plays so well
In time, I know the tide will be turnin 
And she's gonna learn
Shine a light, shine it bright 
And time, will testify I know
I know That (Repeat)
