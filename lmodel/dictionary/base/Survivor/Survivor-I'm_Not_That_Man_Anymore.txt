<song artist="Survivor" title="I'm_Not_That_Man_Anymore">
Teardrops, falling from your eyes like raindrops, 
Pouring from the skies, 
Remember, you used to have the love I needed, back when we were young 
Lovin' always came so easy, heaven shared our love, 
Magic, the first time that I held you, you fit like a glove. 
You'd soothe me, with a shrug of your heart you could move me,
It always seemed my love would find you, when you needed a friend
I would be the man who would understand you, 
*But I'm not that man anymore, 
And I'm not gonna throw my heart away, 
No, that's not me anymore, 
Baby I've changed. *
One look is all it took to tell me your love was made of lies, 
Madness to think that I believed your reasons, your alibis, 
The day girl, when I turned to look the other way girl, 
I realized the game you were playin' was breakin' my heart, 
I can see it plainly, time has changed me. 
( * Repeat)
