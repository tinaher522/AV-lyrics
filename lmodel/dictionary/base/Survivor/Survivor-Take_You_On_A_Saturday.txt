<song artist="Survivor" title="Take_You_On_A_Saturday">
You were hitchin' a ride
When I took you inside
You were tremblin'
Out in the rain, 
Just a face with no name
In the cold
And you cling to my side
Like a desperate child
As the thunder crashed high above
Well now the storm is behind us
It's time for some love
Gonna
*Take you on a Saturday
Lovin' you til Monday mornin'
Take you on a Saturday
I've been waitin', waitin', waitin', yeah*
Now I don't know your past 
And I don't know your last situation
All I know is the way that you feel
In my arms, ooh, my arms
And your body so sweet
And I'm feelin your heat
And this heart's got no time to lose
So hold on tight babe
I'm makin my move
( * Repeat)
And my love will flow like a river
And in gentle waves, 
We'll come and go like the sea
And the feelin' is makin' me shiver, oh yeah
A weekend of love
Then it's back to the world, oh yeah
( * Repeat)
( * Repeat)
