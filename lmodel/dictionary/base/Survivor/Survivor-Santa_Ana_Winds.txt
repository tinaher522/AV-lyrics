<song artist="Survivor" title="Santa_Ana_Winds">
When the wind decides that it's time to rise, 
To spread a little hell through the heartland, 
It takes a good long toke then it blows the smoke
Through the desert night – 
And the wings of fire – 
Keep climbin' higher, 
See the flames cuttin' hard through the homeland, 
It takes a mighty strong will to strip the chill from the desert night --
You're wakened from your dream by a siren's scream, 
Trapped by the walls that surround you -- 
Then it's will to will, and you wonder still can you struggle free?
In a thousand ways, when you turn the phrase, 
The wind's like a love of a woman – 
It takes a mighty mean bitch --
Some fire witch --
To set the night on fire
And the Santa Ana wind's gonna have its way tonight
Nothing you can do's gonna change her mind – 
And ain't it a lot like love the way desire takes you in – 
And stokes the fire like the Santa Ana wind
Now the air is calm, and the heart grows numb, 
The ashes burn low in the heartland, 
'Til again the wind starts closin' in to set the night on fire
And the Santa Ana wind's blowin' cross my heart tonight
Nothing you can do's gonna change her mind -- 
And woman I want your love --
I need that passion deep within, 
Like the ragin' fire needs the Santa Ana wind 
And the Santa Ana wind's gonna take your life tonight
Nothing you can do's gonna change her mind -- 
And ain't it a lot like love
The way desire takes you in -- 
Swept away with the Santa Ana wind
