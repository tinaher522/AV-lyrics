<song artist="Survivor" title="It_Doesn't_Have_To_Be_This_Way">
Sometimes alone at night I lie and wonder --
Was breaking up the only thing to do
We live our separate lives like perfect strangers, 
But in the end, we're really perfect fools --
Maybe in time we'll shake the memories, 
Maybe in time forget the pain --
But baby tonight, this heart remembers
*It doesn't have to be this way --
We don't need to live the lie anymore
I want you back, I'm holding on --
It doesn't have to be this way
Here we stand -- love's an open door, 
It doesn't have to be this way*
With breakin' up there comes this empty feelin'
The child within you, lost without a prayer
So you run a little wild searching for some meaning
Deep into the streets of your despair
What does it take to shake your memory --
What in the world could ease the pain
How can I make your heart surrender
( * Repeat) 
( * Repeat)
