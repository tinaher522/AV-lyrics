<song artist="Survivor" title="Don't_Give_Up">
It's hard to see
And harder to do
It's easy to walk away and say the game is through
But it's up to me
And it comes down to you
It's easy to throw it all away for something new
Don't Give Up
Don't let go
Till' we give it all we've got we'll never know
Don't Give Up
Don't you know
It's taking its toll
Sometimes the road will lead us where we never go
Look in my eyes
And into my heart with all of the time that's come and gone, we've come so far
Don't Give Up
Don't let go
Till' we give it all we've got we'll never know
Don't Give Up
Hold on tight
Nothing is easy when it's real, it feels so right, Yeah!
Don't Give Up
Sometimes it takes so long
To know what's right or wrong
But if you believe enough, it's all you'll ever need
Don't Give Up
Don't Give Up
Hold on tight
Nothing is easy when it's real, it feels so right
Don't Give Up..
Nothing is easy when it's real, it feels so right
Don't Give Up....
