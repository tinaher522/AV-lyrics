<song artist="Survivor" title="Rockin'_Into_The_Night">
Ooh, rockin'
Oh yeah
Cruisin' down the motorway
Got my girl by my side
We're both a little anxious
Ooo, we got love on our mind
Waitin', anticipatin'
For the fireworks in the night
Well I swear we were doin' eighty
When we saw those motel lights
And we were rockin' into the night
Rockin' into the night
Oh hoo, rockin'
Rockin' into the night
Rockin' into the night, yeah
Back on the back streets
Taking love where I can
I found a sweet Madonna
Ooo, with a bible in her hand
Waitin', anticipatin'
Well for someone to save her soul;
Well I ain't no new messiah
But I'm close enough for rock and roll
And we were rockin' into the night
Rockin' into the night
Oh hoo, rockin'
Rockin' into the night
Rockin' into the night
And I'm slowin' down and she's pullin' in
Waitin', anticipatin'
For the fireworks in the night
Well I swear we were doin' eighty
When we saw those motel lights
And we were
Rockin', rockin' into the night
Rockin', rockin' into the night
Rockin', rockin' into the night
