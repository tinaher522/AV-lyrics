<song artist="Survivor" title="Runway_Lights">
Fly above the hills and valleys
High above the streets and alleys
On a home bound flight I carry 
Love enough for one
My emotions overflowing
Anticipation growing
And the moment still not knowing
Seems to weigh a ton
*And those scenarios 
They spin in my mind
They drift, like the clouds
They sail through the night*
**And when I see those runway lights
In the town that I was born
I say a silent prayer you'll still be there
And as my plane is touching down
Will I still belong in the arms that held my life
Or have I stayed away to long**
I see your face in midnight driftings
By my side I hear your heartbeat
Closer still I hold your memory 
Precious in my mind
In the life that I've been chasing
So much times been wasted
I know I could be tasting
The love I left behind
( * Repeat ) 
( ** Repeat ) 
And those scenarios
They spin in my mind..... 
( ** Repeat )
