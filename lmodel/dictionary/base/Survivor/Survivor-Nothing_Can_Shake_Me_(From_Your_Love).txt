<song artist="Survivor" title="Nothing_Can_Shake_Me_(From_Your_Love)">
In this room
With the light of the sun in my eyes
I am blind
Can't recall
Where I am or what I did last night
Though I try and I try
Nothing can shake me from your love
It's true
No one can make me feel the things you do
Oh no, oh no
In the street I can feel people stare, 
Stare me down
I'm lookin' back
Just to see if I lost you somewhere
But you're nowhere around
Nothing can shake me from your love
It's true
No one can make me feel the things you do
Oh no, oh no
Turnin' over the city, 
Just searchin for you
Ravin like a, a mad man
Is there anybody left, 
In this whole damn town
To take pity on a sad man
Lord help me through this
Yeah, help me through this
I just can't make it this way
Please help me find her
Yes help me find her
Somewhere, somehow, someway
In the night
With the moon and the stars high above
I can see
It's so strange
Though there's no rhyme or reason for love
Still it makes you its slave
Nothing can shake me from your love
It's true
No one can make me feel the things you do
Oh no, oh no
Oh no, oh no
Oh no
