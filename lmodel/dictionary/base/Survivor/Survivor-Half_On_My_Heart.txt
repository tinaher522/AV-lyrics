<song artist="Survivor" title="Half_On_My_Heart">
Baby I don't understand it
Feels like only yesterday
And I guess I must have been a foolish man
Just to let you slip away
Ain't it funny how time can turn you around
Bringing us back to the start
And baby up until now I made it somehow
But I was missing the most important part
How can I live, with half on my heart
When you're all that I need to survive
Baby, living without you is getting too hard
Cause you're the only reason I'm alive
You were the one who always showed me
A reason to believe
And I was a fool to leave you lonely
Just waiting there for me
Ain't it funny how time can turn you around
Bringing us back to the start
I was searching for something I needed to find
But you were right here beside me baby all of the time
How can I live, with half on my heart
When you're all that I need to survive
Baby, living without you is getting too hard
You're the only reason I'm alive
Look in my face these tears in my eyes
Without you I'm half of a man
I would do anything, pay any price
If I could just hold you and touch you again
How can I live, with half on my heart
When you're all that I need to survive
Baby, living without you is getting too hard
Cause you're the only reason I'm alive
Half on my heart, baby
Half on my heart, you're the only reason
Half on my heart, only reason
Baby
Half on my heart
