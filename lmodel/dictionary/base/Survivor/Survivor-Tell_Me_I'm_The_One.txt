<song artist="Survivor" title="Tell_Me_I'm_The_One">
If you need any love tonight
I'll give you all you need tonight
There you stand with you back to the wall, 
You got a bad attitude
I've watched the way that you run from it all, 
Does your heart get confused
Would you risk your reputation
Should you even take the chance 
Or are you scared by what you'll say
When the rules aren't in the way
There's no time for hesitation
Let's get on to something real, 
'Cause if it's love you're lookin' for
There's no need to look anymore
*If you need any love tonight --
Tell me I'm the one
We'll take the time to do it right – 
The night lives on
I'll give you all you need tonight – 
Tell me I'm the one
If you need any love tonight
I'll give you all you need tonight*
I'm comin' in on a perfect approach, 
An offer you can't refuse
I'm gonna burn, gonna turn up the heat
With all the love you can use
Am I gettin' your attention
Am I speakin' to your heart, 
There ain't no time to wait and see
You gotta tell me now that it's me
( * Repeat)
