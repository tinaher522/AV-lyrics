<song artist="Survivor" title="Talkin'_Bout_Love">
It's been so long babe since I played this telephone game
I guess eventually some things will never change
And it can't matter to me baby all those words you say
They only remind me of yesterday
Well I see right through your crystal eyes and I already know your brave disguise
But baby you want more then I can give
Baby don't you know -
Everyone you know
Everywhere you go
You're always Talkin' 'Bout Love -
Every night and day every word you say
You're always Talkin' 'Bout Love
And suddenly babe you try to fool me with a kiss
Babe that don't work like it worked before -
Well I don't know what you see in me that causing you all the misery
Baby I can't love you like I did before -
Baby don't you know -
Everyone you know
Everywhere you go
You're always Talkin' 'Bout Love
Every night and day
Every word you say
You're always Talkin' 'Bout Love -
You're always Talkin' 'Bout Love
