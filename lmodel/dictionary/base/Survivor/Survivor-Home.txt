<song artist="Survivor" title="Home">
Wherever I go, whenever I fade away
Wherever I am I know in your heart I'll stay
Whenever you fall no matter how far away
I'll always be there 'cause I can still feel your pain
So just keep holding on
You don't have to be afraid
I know love can be as strong as everything they say
You'll never be alone
I'll always be home
Through all of these years all of these words we said
So many needless tears spinning round in my head
There comes a time when all of the pieces fit
I know you and I we can be so sure of it
So just keep holding on
You don't have to be afraid
I know love can be as strong as everything they say
You'll never be alone
I'll always be home
