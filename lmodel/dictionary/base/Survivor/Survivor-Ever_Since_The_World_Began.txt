<song artist="Survivor" title="Ever_Since_The_World_Began">
I'll never know what brought me here,
As if somebody led my hand,
It seems I hardly had to steer,
My course was planned.
And destiny it guides us all,
And by it's hand we rise and fall,
But only for a moment,
Time enough to catch our breath again.
And we're just another piece of the puzzle,
Just another part of the plan,
How one live touches the other,
Is so hard to understand.
Still we walk this road together,
We travel through as far as we can,
And we have waited for this moment in time,
Ever since the world began.
Taking in the times gone by,
We wonder how it all began,
We'll never know and still we
Try to understand.
And even though the seasons change,
The reasons shall remain the same,
It's love that keeps us holding on
Till we can see the sun again.
And we're just another piece of the puzzle,
Just another part of the plan,
And we have waited for this moment in time,
Ever since the world began.
And I stand alone, a man of stone,
Against the driving rain,
And the night it's got your number,
And the wind it cries your name,
If we search for truth, win or lose,
In this we're all the same,
The hope still burns eternal,
We're the keeper of the flame.
And we're just another piece of the puzzle,
Just another part of the plan,
How one live touches the other,
Is so hard to understand.
Still we walk this road together,
We try and go as far as we can,
And we have waited for this moment in time,
Ever since the world began.
