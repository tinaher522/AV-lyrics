<song artist="Survivor" title="Slander">
The word is out -- heads are talkin'
And just like a fire ragin' wild in the night, 
The rumors hot, the room is rockin', 
It's out of control, too vicious to fight
Two lovers split -- a heart is shattered
And out of revenge it steals through the night, 
Making sure the lies are scattered
To every border of this town tonight
The word's on the street, you call it truth, 
I call it slander, 
Times are tough, talk is cheap --
Soon they'll talk about you --
Slander
The jury splits -- undecided, 
They're searching for clues, 
My live in their hands
The hour has come, they stand divided, 
The future shall judge the good and the bad
And now, there's talk on the street --
I call it slander, 
I will fight this somehow
Revenge will be sweet
Slander -- like a knife in my heart --
Slander
Slander -- gonna keep us apart --
Slander
Slander â€“ there's talk on the street
Slander -- revenge will be sweet
Slander -- I'm ready to fight
Slander -- I will find it tonight
Slander -- like a knife in my heart --
Slander
Slander -- gonna keep us apart
Slander
Slander -- there's talk on the street --
Slander -- revenge will be sweet
Slander -- too vicious to fight
Slander -- wild in the night
