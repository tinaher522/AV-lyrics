<song artist="Survivor" title="Backstreet_Love_Affair">
Girl, is there something in the night
That draws us together
Are these moments worth the fight? 
Why must we keep it to ourselves
The secret we hold inside
Let me take you in my arms
With the strength of a love that's denied
And we've always believed in our heart
That the chances we've missed 
Still exist in the world after dark
*Backstreet love affair
Running through the heart of the night
Backstreet love affair
Meet me in the city tonight*
There's a tension I can taste
That speaks for the danger
Let the warnings go to waste
Eyes that reflect a secret fire
That covers the fear inside
In a flash we're lost from sight
To explore the romance that we hide
And the thrill of the chase plays a part
In the chances we take
We escape to the world after dark
(* Repeat)
