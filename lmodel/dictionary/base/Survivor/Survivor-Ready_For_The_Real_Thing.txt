<song artist="Survivor" title="Ready_For_The_Real_Thing">
Dead on my feet -- got a deadline to meet, 
But it can wait -- can't concentrate --
This one-track mind won't leave you behind
Why punish me with memories
If only now I could turn back the pages --
I played some games that I've lived to regret, 
I only wish I had gone through those stages --
Years before we met --
But I know
*This time -- 
I'm ready for the real thing, 
Last Time -- 
I couldn't be true, 
This time -- 
I'm ready for the real thing too*
Turn on the light, I've been tossing all night, 
I try to read but it's love that I need --
In my mind -- the sound of goodbye, 
Keeps hauntin' me like a distant dream --
If only now I could turn back the pages --
I played some games that I've lived to regret, 
I only wish I had gone through those changes
Years before we met --
And baby
( * Repeat) 
This time -- 
I'm ready for the real thing, 
Last time -- 
I couldn't be true, 
This time -- 
Get ready for the real thing, 
Cause this time baby -- 
I'm ready for you
