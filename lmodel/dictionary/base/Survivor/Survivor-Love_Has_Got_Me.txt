<song artist="Survivor" title="Love_Has_Got_Me">
I tried to resist you in the beginning
Your fire was too hot to fight
You looked into me the flame shot through me
The victory is in sight tonight
*Love has got me, this I know
Love has got me, won't let go
Feel the fire in my soul
Love has got me, love has got me*
Don't let go
Baby be careful don't get me excited
I'm on a mighty short fuse
The least indication will get me ignited
There's just no way to refuse tonight
( * Repeat) 
As sure as the stars are shining
I thought I would never fall in love
I gave my life to freedom
But looks like love has got me now
(* Repeat) 
(* Repeat)
