<song artist="Survivor" title="Chevy_Nights">
When trouble's on my mind I like to reminisce
It was a simpler time, on just a night like this
We were so new to love we'd educate a guess
I taught you all I knew and you filled in the rest
*And I said ooh
Those were heavy nights
We were revin up, those chevy nights with you
(It's True) 
And I said ooh, near the levy site
It was me and you and chevy
Those heavy nights with you*
September nights were cool but though the streets were hot
Perhaps the memories add mystery to the plot
But deep within my soul, I'm glad the times have changed
As long as rock and roll and the chevys stay the same
( * Repeat) 
( * Repeat)
