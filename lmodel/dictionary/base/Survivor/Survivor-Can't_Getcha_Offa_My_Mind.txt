<song artist="Survivor" title="Can't_Getcha_Offa_My_Mind">
Oooh, you've got a way aboutcha
That's shakin' me offa my vine
Oooh, you've got a way aboutcha
And doncha think it's way past time
Only you can put it where I want it
*And I can't getcha off. 
I just can't get you
I can't getcha offa my mind
No I can't getcha off, 
I just can't get you
I can't getcha offa my mind*
Oooh, you've got a sweet way of walkin'
That pushes me offa my mind
Oooh, a street way of talkin'
That lets me know you're just my kind
Cause only you can put it where I need it
(*Repeat) 
Only you, can send me into ecstasy
When you're next to me
When I need you
(*Repeat)
