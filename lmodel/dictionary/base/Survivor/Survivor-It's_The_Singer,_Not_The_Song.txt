<song artist="Survivor" title="It's_The_Singer,_Not_The_Song">
It's just another summer,
You hear a different drummer
You're looking for a way to check out from this grind
You wrestle with temptation,
Your job is sheer frustration
'Cause there's a lifetime chance you've yet to find
Still you wonder if you've got the clout
To make it happen in this cold-hearted town
And you're feelin' that you're trapped
You wonder should you just stop tryin'
Well take a message from the man
Who's not afraid to come on strong
When there's magic in the music
It's the singer not the song
When it's comin' from the heart
All the people sing along
It's the man behind the music
It's the singer not the song
Inside you heart is achin'
There's challenge for the taking
So shoot it from the hip
Believe in what you say
You're calling this your best fight
You're looking for the limelight
Reachin' for a star to guide you on your way
Well give the glory to the man
Who's not afraid to come on strong
When there's magic in the music
It's the singer not the song
When it's comin' from the heart
All the people sing along
It's the man behind the music
It's the singer not the song
