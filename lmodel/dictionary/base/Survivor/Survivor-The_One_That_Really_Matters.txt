<song artist="Survivor" title="The_One_That_Really_Matters">
I know your mind like the back of my hand,
A race that I ran before, 
Are you so blind that you'd turn your back
On love and slam the door, 
If you're searching for something more, 
Have a good time, 
But if you'd follow your heart, 
You're gonna find that I'm... 
*The one, the one, 
The one that really matters, 
The one that really cares, 
The one, when your whole world is shattered, 
Snap your fingers and I'll be there.*
There's someone new, 
He's your brand new toy, 
You could break that poor boy in two, 
If that's your style, 
I should have known from the start, 
This heart wants no part of you, 
But if you're still the same girl I knew, 
All in good time, 
You're gonna follow your heart, 
And you're gonna find I'm still... 
( * Repeat)
