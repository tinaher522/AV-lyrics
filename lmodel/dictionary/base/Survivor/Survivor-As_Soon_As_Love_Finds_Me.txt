<song artist="Survivor" title="As_Soon_As_Love_Finds_Me">
** I've been holdin' out
I've been hiding from the light
Sneakin' down the back streets
Sneakin' down the backstreets
But no longer, can hide my eyes
From the city nights**
* And soon as love finds me I will go
No I won't, say no
As soon as love finds me (when it finds me) 
I will go*
Now I've had my share 
of one night affairs
When I was a little younger 
(just a little younger) 
Well it wasn't love
But we really didn't care
It was close enough
(* Repeat) 
All my life I pretended ya know
I'd go through the motions
It's never been love
It's always been wrong, it's gotta be
Right on the time this time
I need, deep devotion
It's gonna be real emotion
Or I refuse to go
(**Repeat) 
(* Repeat) 
I will go
