<song artist="Survivor" title="Fire_Makes_Steel">
Under the gun the game can get rough (Yeah)
I'm feeling no pain, calling it's bluff, it's bluff
Does crossing the finish line, mean breaking all the rules
Out on the edge, the pressure can get to you
Whatever it takes to stoke the fire inside
I'm ready to feel that burn tonight.
(Cause) Fire Makes Steel
You're as hard as you feel
When you're running on faith it's the power that takes you over
When they're hot on your heels
(Yeah) Fire Makes Steel
The hunger inside keeps driving me on
Fire Makes Steel
There's no way to take the easy way out (no...)
It doesn't exist in a world full of doubt, of doubt
I found what I'm searching for, I say no pain no gain
You do it your way, I do it mine
Whatever it takes to stoke the fire inside
I'm ready to feel that burn tonight.
(Cause) Fire Makes Steel
You're as hard as you feel
When you're running on faith it's the power that takes you over
When they're hot on your heels
(Yeah) Fire Makes Steel
The hunger inside keeps drivin' me on
Don't you know!
(Cause) Fire Makes Steel
You're as hard as you feel
When you're running on faith it's the power that takes you over
When they're hot on your heels
(Yeah) Fire Makes Steel
When you're running on faith it's the power that takes you over
(It's the power that takes you over, yeah)
