<song artist="Survivor" title="American_Heartbeat">
The night's alive with wind and fire,
We telegraph our heart's desire,
Through the night,
With our eyes,
Wheels are turning fast and hard,
Hearts are burnin' on the Boulevard,
Hear them pound - young and proud,
It's the American heartbeat,
(pre-ch)
Chart the stars and head out for the action,
Hit the streets and find some satisfaction,
(ch)
It's the American heartbeat,
It's the American heartbeat,
It's the American heartbeat,
Oh, the American heartbeat,
The stage is set; the roles are chosen,
The lights grow hot as the midnight's closin,'
In at last - it comes so fast,
Poundin' harder as the midnight's strikin,'
It hits us like a bolt of lightning,
Deeper down,
It's the sound,
Of the American heartbeat,
(pre-ch)
Chart the stars and head out for the action,
Hit the streets an find some satisfaction,
(ch)
It's the American heartbeat - fast and loud,
The American heartbeat - young and proud,
American heartbeat - Ohhh...
The American heartbeat,
It's the American heartbeat - American heartbeat,
It's the American heartbeat - American..
It's the American heartbeat - Ohhh..
The American heartbeat,
(keyboard interlude)
(ch) repeat to fade
