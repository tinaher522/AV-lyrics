<song artist="Survivor" title="Half_Of_My_Heart">
Baby I don't understand it
Feels like only yesterday
And I guess I must have been a foolish man
Just to let you slip away
And it find it how time
Can turn you round
Bringing us back to the start
Baby up until now
I made it somehow
But I was missing the most important part
How can I live
With half on my heart
When you're all that I need to survive
Baby living without you
Is getting to hard
Cause you're the only reason I'm alive
You were the one and only who showed me
The reason to live
And I was a fool to leave you lonely
Just waiting there for me
And it find it how time
Can turn you round
Bringing us back to the start
I was searching for something
I needed to find
With you were right here beside me baby all of the time
How can I live
With half on my heart
When you're all that I need to survive
Baby living without you
Is getting to hard
You're the only reason I'm alive
Well look at my face
These tears in my eyes
Will fight you out heaven and hell
I will do anything
And pay any price
If I could just hold you and touch you again
How can I live
With half on my heart
When you're all that I need to survive
Baby living without you
Is getting to hard
Cause you're the only reason I'm alive
Half on my heart
Half on my heart, baby
Half on my heart, baby
Half on my heart, you're the only reason
Half on my heart, only reason
Baby
Half on my heart
Half on my heart
Half on my heart
Half on my heart
