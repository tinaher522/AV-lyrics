<song artist="Survivor" title="Whole_Town's_Talking">
Don't you try to make amends
The damage has been done
Don't expect to part as friends
The battle's just begun
I waited at your beck and call
My world turned all around you
I should of known the day I found you
You'd be leaving me behind
The whole town, 
The whole town's talkin'
The whole town
The whole town, 
The whole town's talkin'
The whole town
They're starin' as I'm passin' by
how can they be so cold? 
They're whisperin' that I'm the guy
I don't need to be told
Remember all the days in love
how could you run to strangers? 
Well I knew I was in danger
When it happened overnight
The whole town, 
The whole town's talkin'
The whole town
The whole town, 
The whole town's talkin'
The whole town
Now don't you try to make amends
The damage has been done
And don't expect to part as friends
The battle's just begun
I waited at your beck and call
My world turned all around you
I should of known the day I found you
You'd be leaving me behind
The whole town, 
The whole town's talkin'
The whole town
The whole town, 
The whole town's talkin'
The whole town
The whole town, 
The whole town's talkin'
The whole town
The whole town, 
The whole town's talkin'
The whole town
The whole town, 
The whole town's talkin'
The whole town
The whole town, 
The whole town's talkin'
The whole town
