<song artist="Survivor" title="Keep_It_Right_Here">
**You are the love without exception
You're in my book of answered prayers
No need to change your heart's direction
At every crossroad I'll be there**
Through endless nights and life's confusion
Just simply sound your heart's alarm
I guarantee you'll find compassion
Right here within these open arms
There will be nights some restless nights
When you're alone your thoughts start to wander
Wonderin' if it's right, you search the night
Baby you're home, why look any farther
*Keep it right here, 
Keep it right here
Your sweet love
Keep it right here, 
Keep it right here
Your sweet love*
You are the love that I can count on
The only one who truly cared
Deep in your eyes I found my fortune
I treasure every night we've shared
There will be nights some restless nights
When you're alone your thoughts start to wander
Wonderin' if it's right, you search the night
Baby you're home, why look any farther
( * Repeat) 
When you're lost and lonely
Nowhere to turn 
Call out my name
There's no need to face it alone
You know the answer
Deep in your heart
Don't doubt what we've got
Cause baby you're home
(** Repeat) 
(* Repeat)
