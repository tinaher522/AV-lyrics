<song artist="Survivor" title="So_Far">
You only want to dance with me,
'coz you're alone again, (alone again)
But I heard you whisperin' things,
That I won't forget,
Suddenly we're kissing,
We were spinnin' around,
Feel that you,
But then I look in to your eyes,
I decide,
That everything is gonna all right,
All the time,
And when I look into your eyes,
I decide,
That everything is gonna be all right,
All the time,
I know it's naughty in reality,
To you,
But I'm drewnblin' every moment when I wake up,
Thinkin' of you,
I'm thinkin' about you too,
So set me alive,
Feel that you,
But when I look in to your eyes,
I decide,
That everything is gonna be all right,
All the time,
'coz when I look in to your eyes,
I decide,
That everything is gonna be all right,
All the time,
And when I look in to your eyes, 
I decide,
That everything is gonna be all right,
All the time,
All the time,
