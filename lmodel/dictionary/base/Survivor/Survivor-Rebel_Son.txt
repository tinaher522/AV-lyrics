<song artist="Survivor" title="Rebel_Son">
You're still young, still so sure
So determined you can find the cure
You've always been the driven one
Speak your mind, rebel son
In your eyes, wildfires rage
You read between the lines on every page
Take your chances while you're young
Seek the truth, rebel son
Shatter the silence
Fill the night with your righteous defiance
While you've still got the will to run
Chorus:
Take your message to the street tonight—rebel son
There's a distant voice that's calling you
Through the darkest night, fight the fight—rebel son
To yourself alone you must be true—rebel son
Stand your ground, against the tide
The proof of history is on your side
Fight the cause for everyone
Dare to dream, rebel son
Shatter the silence
Fill the night with your righteous defiance
While you've still got the will to run
( chorus )
Bridge:
In the dark, thunder in your heart
Can't you hear the sound and fury in the night
Feel the heat, rising from the street
Passion runs so deep
To match the fire in your eyes
( solos )
( chorus )
Rebel son ( x3 )
