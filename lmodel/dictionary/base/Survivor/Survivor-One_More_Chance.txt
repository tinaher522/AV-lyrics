<song artist="Survivor" title="One_More_Chance">
I've run out of time to waste, got a fever in my mind
One more chance to take it's been a long and lonely time
There's no going back, can't change the things I've done
I've got no reason left to run
Forgiveness is hard to find, gotta take it while you can
I've lost all my foolish pride, just an ordinary man
(And) Time waits for no one
And love will pass you by
Don't waste another moment wondering why
Give me one more chance to love, just one
Give me one more chance to touch the sky above
We've run out of time to waste, why don't you leave the past behind
Your road ain't a lonely place 'cause it's paved with hearts like mine 
(And) Time waits for no one
And love will pass you by
Don't spend another moment asking why
Give me one more chance to love, just one
Give me one more chance to touch the sky above
I need one more chance to love, just one
Give me one more chance to touch the sky above
Why do you make it so hard
Living day by day
Just take a look at you now
What more can I say
Give me one more chance to love, just one
Give me one more chance to touch the sky above
I need one more chance to love, just one
Give me one more chance to touch the sky above
