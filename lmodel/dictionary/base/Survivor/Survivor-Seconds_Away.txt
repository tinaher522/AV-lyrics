<song artist="Survivor" title="Seconds_Away">
These are the days, the time we've been given
To do what we will, what we can
The streets of the city they flow like a river
And the dreams they can slip through your hands
How will I see if I cannot believe it
How in the world would I know
How will I fly if I can not conceive it
Still we all need to know
We're seconds away
From another tomorrow
Seconds away
From another hello
Seconds away
From a moment of sorrow
We're seconds away
With every heartbeat I can feel it
Something keeps drivin' me on
Must be the call of my own human spirit
This thing that just keeps in and holding on
How will I see if I cannot believe it
How in the world would I know
How will I fly if I can not conceive it
Still we all need to know
We're seconds away
From another tomorrow
Seconds away
From another hello
Seconds away
From a moment of sorrow
We're seconds away
Some life is forever, some are out of time 
Some still chase the passions some will leave them all behind 
Everything keeps changing, it can all turn on a dime
In the blink of an eye
We're seconds away
From another tomorrow
Seconds away
From another hello
Seconds away
From a moment of sorrow
We're seconds away
