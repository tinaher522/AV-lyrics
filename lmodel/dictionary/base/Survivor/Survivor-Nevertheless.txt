<song artist="Survivor" title="Nevertheless">
Don't let 'em tell you that it's up to you
There's a wall of silence you can never break through
You gotta jump down, turn around and face the facts
Don't you ever give in 'cause you'll never get back
There's a power in this pounding heart that defies the doubting crowd
'Cause when they're dead and gone, we'll still be standing
Nevertheless, Nevertheless, Woh Oh
The wave of tomorrow is anyone's guess
We're fighting the battle like all of the rest
Never surrender - Nevertheless
Never surrender - Nevertheless
Baby all of their rules ain't our concern
Sometimes you gotta forget a little more then you learn
It's an upphill battle when the odds are long
You know they're counting you out but you're calling them wrong
Come walk with me down this distant path
Were are hopes and dreams collide
It's an open road from where I'm standing
Nevertheless, Nevertheless, Woh Oh
The wave of tomorrow is anyone's guess
We're fighting the battle like all of the rest
Never surrender - Nevertheless
Nevertheless, Nevertheless, Woh Oh
The wave of tomorrow is anyone's guess
We're fighting the battle like all of the rest
Never surrender - Nevertheless
Never surrender - Nevertheless
You can feel it in the streets of America
From the white house to tobacco road
Can't you see that there's two Americas
Where the hell are we supposed to go
There's a power in this pounding heart that defies the doubting crowd
'Cause when they're dead and gone, we'll still be standing
Nevertheless, Nevertheless, Woh Oh
The wave of tomorrow is anyone's guess
We're fighting the battle like all of the rest
Never surrender - Nevertheless
Nevertheless, Nevertheless, Woh Oh
The wave of tomorrow is anyone's guess
We're fighting the battle like all of the rest
Never surrender - Nevertheless
Never surrender - Nevertheless
