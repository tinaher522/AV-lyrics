<song artist="Survivor" title="What_Do_You_Really_Think?">
Do you love me? Tell me if it's true,
Does that look of love reflect the real you?
Why does passion disappear when we're apart,
Are you secretly breaking my heart?
What do you really think,
What do you really think of me --
What do you really think,
What do you really think about me,
About me, I gotta know
We were dreamers, rebels in our youth,
Did our fantasies obscure the bitter truth,
Why do you turn your head when those boys walk by --
Try looking me straight in the eye
What do you really think,
What do you really think of me --
What do you really think,
What do you really think about me,
About me, I gotta know
Ooh, can I reach you, is it worth the climb,
Let me teach you, what's the bottom line,
Shall we try again some other place and time, in time,
Must every passing day be so tough girl,
Are you secretly breaking us up girl,
I wanna know, and gotta know for sure, I wanna know
Do you love me? Tell me if it's true,
Does that look of love reflect your point of view?
Why does passion disappear when we're apart,
Are you secretly breaking my heart?
What do you really think,
What do you really think of me --
What do you really think,
What do you really think about me,
About me, I gotta know
