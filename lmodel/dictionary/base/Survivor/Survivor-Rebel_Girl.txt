<song artist="Survivor" title="Rebel_Girl">
Out on the edge of night
In any city you can name
There rides a rebel girl
The wild one no one dared to tame
And the light in her eyes is a fire
[Chorus 1]
Have you seen her
The rebel girl in action in the city
At night you hear her call
Ooh, rebel girl
Don't try to take her in
She says she runs her life alone
She wants you to believe
A rebel's heart is made of stone
And the light in her eyes is desire
[Chorus 2]
Have you seen her
The rebel girl in action in the city
At night you hear her call
Ohhh the rebel girl so lonely and so pretty
Bringing out the rebel in us all
It's a lonely world for a rebel girl
So far from home she's all alone in a rebel world
[Repeat chorus 2]
She's just a rebel girl
[Repeat &amp; fade]
