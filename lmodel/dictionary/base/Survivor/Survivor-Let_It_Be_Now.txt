<song artist="Survivor" title="Let_It_Be_Now">
I've been waitin', tired of waitin'
For your song. your love song
Time just drags by anticipatin'
So much good love has come and gone
**And every minute
We spend apart is just time on my hands
It's breakin' my heart
Won't you please, please**
*Let it be now, 
I can't wait forever no
Let it be now. 
I need you today. 
(girl) 
Girl will you ever know
Let it be now*
I been hungry, so damn hungry
For your love, your sweet love
Are you teasing, me for a reason
Need to know, why so slow
(** Repeat) 
Let it be now, 
I can't wait forever no
Let it he now, I need you today
(** Repeat) 
(* Repeat) 
My love won't wait... (Repeat)
