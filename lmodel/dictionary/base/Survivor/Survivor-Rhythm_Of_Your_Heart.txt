<song artist="Survivor" title="Rhythm_Of_Your_Heart">
Just opened your letter, read it at least a thousand times
I look through a teardrop and read between the lines
A suitcase of dreams with one left behind
I wonder out loud if love can survive through time and tide
Then you send a message in the dark
And I feel the rythm of your heart
When all my illusions fall apart
There's only the rythm of your heart
Here in the spotlight, I miss you from each and every stage
I open my heart and turn another page
Another day gone and still I'm alone
Seems like I'm just always just a song away from home
Then you send a message in the dark
And I feel the rythm of your heart
When all my illusions fall apart
There's only the rythm of your heart
Just opened your letter, read it at least a thousand times
I look through a teardrop and read between the lines
A suitcase of dreams with one left behind
Then you send a message in the dark
And I feel the rythm of your heart
When all my illusions fall apart
There's only the rythm of your heart
