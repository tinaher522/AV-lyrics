<song artist="Survivor" title="Here_Comes_Desire">
Here comes desire, I can spot it a mile away
She's on fire, I got the one thing to put out the flame
I got your number, give it up
I know you know that I'm on to you
No need to fight it, lay it down
Come feel the heat in my every move
This ain't no shot in the dark
I'll put it all on the line
Come down and tear me apart
Don't wait, hit me straight, right between the eyes
*Here comes desire
Here comes the thrill
You got me burnin'
Too hot, it's overkill
Bring on the fire
Turn up the heat
Here comes desire
Buildin' up inside of me
(Every time you're touchin' me)*
Midnight strangers, what's your action baby tell me your game
Love and danger, after midnight they're one and the same
You use your body like a gun
Don't take no chances, shoot to kill
I got you covered, give it up
I'll give you more than a moment's thrill
This ain't no shot in the dark
I'll put it all on the line
Come down and tear me apart
Don't wait, hit me straight, right between the eyes
( * Repeat) 
Here comes desire, 
I can spot it a mile away
She's on fire, I got the 
one thing to put out the flame
This ain't no shot in the dark
I'll put it on the line
Come down and tear me apart
Don't wait, hit me straight, 
right between the eyes
( * Repeat)
