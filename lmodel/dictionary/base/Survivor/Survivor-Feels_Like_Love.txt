<song artist="Survivor" title="Feels_Like_Love">
I'm red-hot, higher than high
Getting some action on a midnight ride, 
Feeling all right, this Saturday night, 
Your touch ignites the fire
Driving my heel to the edge of desire
Feeling so right, it's Saturday night, 
No more lonely nights searching for this feeling,
Lovelight's shining in your eyes
*Girl it sure feels like love
I need every day
Yeah it sure feels like love
I've been waiting, so long waiting
And it feels like love.* 
I once thought love was for fools
For broken hearts and broken rules
I was so wrong, for so long
We're pulling over to the side of the road,
Decide if it's love or just an overload
Girl I need to know, ohh I gotta know
No more lonely nights searching for this feeling
Lovelight's burning in your eyes
