<song artist="Survivor" title="Oceans">
Into the night, two of a kind
We rode the crest of the wave
Are we destined to leave love behind
I'll pay the price, just tell me the cost
To save something here in our heart
Something dear that cannot be lost
And I can't help but wonder out loud
If only we could go back to square one
If finally we could pinpoint where we lost touch
I stand alone, reaching out my hand to you
*Oceans between us
Strangers upon the shore
Like islands we stand alone
Oceans between us now
Oceans surround us
Stand and watch as they disappear
To challenge the rising tide
Or drown in a sea of tears*
We shut out the hurt, we cast love aside
Stubborn beyond the point of all reason
Stranded by pride
Craving your touch, oh, under its spell
Knowing for certain that no one on earth
Could love you so well
And I know that you're wondering now
If only we could go back to square one
If finally we could pinpoint, where we lost touch
I stand alone, reaching out my hand to you
( * Repeat)
