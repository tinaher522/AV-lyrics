<song artist="Survivor" title="Gimme_The_Word">
Love stands behind a stained glass wall
In the hands of time
Always waiting to watch you fall
It's the patient kind
Just listen to your heart and hear
(Oh) It's very clear
Here is the place and time
Will you be mine
We share this feelings they're forever
An inspiration in the making
The time is now, now or never
It's all about giving and taking
You're waiting for a place in time
You'll never find (You'll never find)
Let the rythm of your heart run free
For you and me
Give Me The Word
The word is love
It's a hungry word
That I never thought too much of
Give Me The Word
Give me the sign
Cause I'll be here waiting for you
From a distance love calls out to you
Once in a lifetime and never too soon
All I know is, when you're touching me
You're all I want
You're all I need
Give Me The Word
The word is love
It's a hungry word
That I never thought too much of
Give Me The Word
Give me the sign
Cause I'll be here waiting for you
Give Me The Word
The word is free
I'll be here waiting for you
The Word
The word is love
I'll be there waiting for you
