<song artist="Survivor" title="Rhythm_Of_The_City">
The news is out, it's hot on the street
It's down to the wire, it's back to the beat
As the sun goes West there's change in the wind
Hear the rhythm of hearts as the night rushes in
Feel the temperature rise to a fever pitch
And the city will hold back its power
Then the rhythm explodes as the hour strikes
*Midnight, my love is alive
Can't you feel the heat
Of emotions taking over
Midnight, my love will survive
Can't you feel the rhythm
I can feel the rhythm of the city*
The night draws near, the street lights reveal
A whole world beyond this concrete and steel
Let me feel your touch in the midnight wind
In the traffic of hearts as the night rushes in
Feel the temperature rise to a fever pitch
And the city will hold back its power
Then the rhythm explodes as the hour strikes
(* Repeat) 
Come on baby turn out the lights
Let me move you to the rhythm tonight
Feel it building to my every beat
Keep me comin' 'til I'm back on the street and it's
(* Repeat)
