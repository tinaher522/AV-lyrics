<song artist="Survivor" title="In_Good_Faith">
THERE'S A PLACE WITHIN MY HEART
TUCKED AWAY FROM ALL THE PAIN
AND DEEP WITHIN THIS SECRET SIDE OF ME
JUST THE SIMPLE TRUTH REMAINS
WORDS DON'T COME EASY
FEELINGS I HIDE EVEN FROM MYSELF
I'M READY TO SHARE WITHOUT HESITATION
I'VE BEEN SAVING THIS MOMENT
FOR SOMEONE WHO'S SAVING THIS MOMENT TOO
TELL ME IT'S YOU
Chorus:
I'LL GIVE YOU EVERYTHING THAT I'VE GOT
SAY YOU'LL NEVER TURN AND RUN
'CAUSE EACH AND EVERY BEAT OF MY HEART
TELLS ME YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
I'VE CAST ASIDE, THIS FOOLISH PRIDE
I KNOW I CAN KEEP YOU SATISFIED
I'LL PROVE IT TONIGHT IN SO MANY WAYS
THAT'S A PROMISE FROM THE HEART
IN GOOD FAITH
IN THE ROLES THAT WE HAVE CHOSEN
BEHIND THE PARTS WE SOMETIMES PLAY
LIES THE PASSAGE TO THE REAL ME
WITH NO ILLUSIONS IN THE WAY
WORDS DON'T COME EASY
BUT I'LL GET THE FEELING ACROSS SOMEHOW
LET IT BE NOW...
( chorus )
Bridge:
BEHIND THESE EYES TONIGHT
THE TRUTH COMES SHINING
A FIRE THAT IS RARELY SEEN
IT BURNS FOR YOU
I'VE NEVER NEEDED ANYONE THIS WAY
NEVER FIND THE RIGHT WORDS TO SAY
UNTIL TODAY
( chorus )
