<song artist="Survivor" title="Poor_Man's_Son">
Baby if you really love me
You had better understand
That the silver in your pocket
Ain't no measure of a man
*And though the fortunes of our fathers
We aspire to rise above
When you're born into a breed 
You're signed in blood*
**I'm a poor mans son
Workin' all night long
Got a bad guitar 
And a simple song
You're a rich mans daughter 
Look at what you've done
You went and fell in love 
With a poor mans son**
Baby you were born in splendor
To a house of wealth and fame
Your mother was a spender
And you grew up on a stage
And girl you coulda loved for money
Coulda fooled around for fame
You went and took a chance
On the real thing
( * Repeat ) 
( ** Repeat )
