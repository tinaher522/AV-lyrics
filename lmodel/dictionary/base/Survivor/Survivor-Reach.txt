<song artist="Survivor" title="Reach">
Beyond the new horizon
Destiny lost and found
You're gonna have it all somehow
Waiting for your arrival
Only a moment now
In the blink of an eye it all comes down
Nothing is easy, Nothing is Free
You got to take one step at a time
Reach
Out to reach your dream
Never stop believing, nothing can hold you down
(Yeah) Reach
Out with all your heart
Shine on through the dark
Soon it will come around
Out of the ashes falling
Into the open sky
Like a tide that's rising you and I
And like an eagle soaring
Flying so wild and free
There are no chains around you and me
Nothing is easy, Nothing is Free
Follow the vision only you can see
Reach
Out to reach your dream
Never stop believing, nothing can hold you down
(Yeah) Reach
Out with all your heart
Shine on through the dark
Soon it will come around
There is no limit to the sky
Don't let one minute pass you by
With all that you've been given
Give it up while you're still living
Reach
Out to reach your dream
Never stop believing, nothing can hold you down
Reach
Out with all your heart
Shine on through the dark
Soon it will come around
