<song artist="Banks" title="Brain">
But it's all the same 
Like I had foreseen 
That you would act like you are 
Oh so cool you seem 
Blending with that scene 
Wearing what you think is hard 
I can see you struggling 
Boy don't hurt your brain 
Thinking what you're gonna say 
'Cause everything's a game 
Always try to calculate 
Trying to look smart 
But not too smart to threaten anything they say
But it's all the same 
Like I had foreseen 
That you would act like you are 
Oh so cool you seem 
Blending with that scene 
Wearing what you think is hard 
I can see you struggling 
Boy don't hurt your brain 
Thinking what you're gonna say 
'Cause everything's a game 
Always try to calculate 
Trying to look smart 
But not too smart to threaten anything they say
