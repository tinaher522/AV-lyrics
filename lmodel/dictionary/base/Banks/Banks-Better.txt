<song artist="Banks" title="Better">
Why you so afraid?
I can see you hating, hating, hating, hating, hating
Withering away
I can see you dying, dying, dead, dying, dead
Why? Why?
Baby see
Try
I can love you better than she, yeah
I can love you better than she can
How couldn't you see?
All the water's cold, cold, cold, cold, cold
Why you lie to me?
You hide in a hole, hole, hole, hole, hole
And why don't you see?
Yeah, baby try
Try to see
Yeah, try, yeah
I can love you better than she can
Can-can-can-can-can-can
Can-can-can-can-can-can
I can love you better than she can
I can love you better than she can
