<song artist="Banks" title="Work">
Make this promise now, promise now, promise now...
If you work we harder, work we harder, work we harder...
Make this promise now, promise now, promise now...
If you work we harder, work we harder, work we harder...
I’ll try hard to control my temper
You know I gotta hot head
'Cause I’ma scream, I'ma yell 
But it's out of love 
And I can't have you give up just yet
You, no, you ain’t no perfect, angel
You done some hurtful things, too
I don’t care, let’s move on, it’s all in the past
I just wanna be loved by you
Make this promise now, I will be your ground
If you work we harder, I will be your water
Make this promise now, I will be your ground
If you work we harder, I will be your water
Work, work, work, we harder
Work, work, work, we harder
Work, work, work, we harder
Work, work, work, we harder
Make this promise now, promise now, promise now...
If you work we harder, work we harder, work we harder...
Make this promise now, I will be your ground
If you work we harder, I will be your water
Make this promise now, I will be your ground
If you work we harder, I will be your water
Work, work, work, we harder
Work, work, work, we harder
Work, work, work, we harder
Work, work, work, we harder
Make this promise now, promise now, promise now...
If you work we harder, work we harder, work we harder...
I’ll try hard to control my temper
You know I gotta hot head
'Cause I’ma scream, I'ma yell 
But it's out of love 
And I can't have you give up just yet
You, no, you ain’t no perfect angel
You done some hurtful things, too
I don’t care, let’s move on, it’s all in the past
I just wanna be loved by you
Make this promise now, I will be your ground
If you work we harder, I will be your water
Make this promise now, I will be your ground
If you work we harder, I will be your water
Work, work, work, we harder
Work, work, work, we harder
Work, work, work, we harder
Work, work, work, we harder
Make this promise now, promise now, promise now...
If you work we harder, work we harder, work we harder...
