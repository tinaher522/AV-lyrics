<song artist="Banks" title="Under_The_Table">
It already started
I tried to stop it but I already know
You are something I should do without
But I won't
I'm under the table
Just keep wishing I'll come out but I don't
You are something I should do without
But I won't
Please tell me that this could be easy
I'm tired of waiting for permission to love
Heartbreak is your game, but I'm learning
My heart could be yours, won't you make it your own
I'm already falling
I couldn't help it, didn't think of the risks
I got a problem, problem when I look in your eyes
You're mine and you know it
I still do it even if we were cursed
Won't you be my rubble, it's okay with me if it hurts
Please tell me that this could be easy
I'm tired of waiting for permission to love
Heartbreak is your game, but I'm learning
My heart could be yours, won't you make it your own
Please tell me that this could be easy
I'm tired of waiting for permission to love
Heartbreak is your game, but I'm learning
My heart could be yours, won't you make it your own
Please tell me that this could be easy
I'm tired of waiting for permission to love
Heartbreak is your game, but I'm learning
My heart could be yours, won't you make it your own
