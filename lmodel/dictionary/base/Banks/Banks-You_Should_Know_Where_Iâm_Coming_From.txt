<song artist="Banks" title="You_Should_Know_Where_Iâm_Coming_From">
What if I said I'd break your heart?
What if I said I have problems that made me, me?
What if I knew I would just rip your mind apart
Would you let me out?
Maybe you can stop before you start
Maybe you can see that I just may be too crazy to love
If I told you solitude fits me like a glove
Would you let me out?
You ought to know where I'm coming from
How I was alone when I burned my home
And all of the pieces were torn and thrown
You should know where I'm coming from
What if I said I was just too young?
What if I said I was built on bricks of carelessness and crumbs
What if I said I'd be gone before I could come
Would you let me out?
You ought to know where I'm coming from
How I was alone when I burned my home
And all of the pieces were torn and thrown
You should know where I'm coming from
Your sought out ways
My own, my own
But you turn me away from my low blows
Boy, you should've known
You ought to know where I'm coming from
How I was alone when I burned my home
And all of the pieces were torn and thrown
You should know where I'm coming from
You ought to know where I'm coming from
How I was alone when I burned my home
And all of the pieces were torn and thrown
You should know where I'm coming from
