<song artist="Banks" title="Stick">
Cold shoulders
So sick are you make it come quick
Hard to demonstrate
So down for you, licorice stick
Cold shoulders
So sick are you make it come quick
Hard to demonstrate
So down for you, licorice stick
I got to take you home
We're living in hard times, we're living in hard times
Baby, you think you know
I think it's about time, that you're gonna make me wild
Baby, you don't wanna leave
You'd be sorry, cause honestly
I can make you feel better, any day
Look at what you've done for me
I called it how I see
You belong with me
Cold shoulders
So sick are you make it come quick
Hard to demonstrate
So down for you, licorice stick
Cold shoulders
So sick are you make it come quick
Hard to demonstrate
So down for you, licorice stick
Tell me I got you, baby
I wanna know how you taste
I wanna know how you taste
Now that you keep me warm
Baby I call you fire
And maybe I'll be your fire
Baby, you don't wanna leave
You'd be sorry, cause honestly
I can make you feel better, any day
Look at what you've done for me
I called it how I see
You belong with me
Cold shoulders
So sick are you make it come quick
Hard to demonstrate
So down for you, licorice stick
Cold shoulders
So sick are you make it come quick
Hard to demonstrate
So down for you, licorice stick
Tell her you love her, tell her you're down for
Tell her you're down for it
Tell her you love her, tell her you're down for
Tell her you're down for it
Tell her you love her, tell her you're down for
Tell her you're down for it
Tell her you love her, tell her you're down for
Tell her you're down for it
