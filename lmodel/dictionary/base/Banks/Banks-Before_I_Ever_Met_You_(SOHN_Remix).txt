<song artist="Banks" title="Before_I_Ever_Met_You_(SOHN_Remix)">
Before I ever met you
I never knew that my heart could love so hard
Before I ever met you
I never knew I would be enemies with disregard
Before I ever met you
I never knew that I liked to be kissed for days
Before I ever met you
I never knew I could be broken in so many ways
I never knew I could be broken in so many ways
I never knew I could be broken
Everyone knows I'm right about one thing
You and I don't work out
You bring out the mean in me
I bring out your insecurities
You know what I am talking bout
Eventually you'll be fine if we break up
And one day I'll be fine, too
But we should just end it now
Before someone gets more hurt than they have to
As for our house, I'll move out
You can keep the dog we trained
Things soon will be like before I ever met you
Before I ever met you
As for our house, I'll move out
You can keep the dog we trained
Things soon will be like before I ever met you
Before I ever met you
Before I ever met you
I never knew that my heart could love so hard
Before I ever met you
I never knew I would be enemies with disregard
Before I ever met you
I never knew that I liked to be kissed for days
Before I ever met you
I never knew I could be broken in so many ways
I never knew I could be broken in so many ways
I never knew I could be broken in so many ways
I never knew I could be broken in so many ways
I never knew I could be broken in so many
