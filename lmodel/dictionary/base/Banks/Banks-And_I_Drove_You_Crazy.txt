(And I drove you crazy...)
Even though I should of known
It was a bad idea to love you
All I wanted was to lift each other up
All I wanted was to lift each other up
I couldn't even find a date or navigate a way around you
All I wanted was to lift each other up
I never wanted you to hurt too much to touch
What are you looking for
(And I drove you crazy)
Wanted to be your girl
(And I drove you crazy)
And anything you wanted
(And I drove you crazy)
Baby I tried to be
(And I drove you crazy)
What are you looking for
(And I drove you crazy)
Wanted to be your girl
(And I drove you crazy)
Any way you wanted me
(And I drove you crazy)
Baby I tried to be
(And I drove you crazy)
What are you looking for?
(And I drove you crazy)
Wanted to be your girl
(And I drove you crazy)
And anything you wanted
(And I drove you crazy)
I drove you crazy
(And I drove you crazy)
Baby I tried to be
(And I drove you crazy)
What are you looking for
(And I drove you crazy)
Wanted to be your girl
(And I drove you crazy)
In any way you wanted me
(And I drove you crazy)
Believe I tried to be
And I drove you crazy
And I drove you crazy
And I drove you crazy
And I drove you crazy
And I drove you crazy
And I drove you crazy
And I drove you crazy
And I drove you crazy
Oh I see that looking back
I know I blocked out all the red flags
I should of seen that you would only mess me up
I should of seen that I would only mess you up
I know you hurt, I know you hurt, I drove you crazy
You should of seen that I'd only mess you up
I should of seen eventually you would give up
What are you looking for
(And I drove you crazy)
Wanted to be your girl
(And I drove you crazy)
And anything you wanted
(And I drove you crazy)
Baby I tried to be
(And I drove you crazy)
What are you looking for
(And I drove you crazy)
Wanted to be your girl
(And I drove you crazy)
Any way you wanted me
(And I drove you crazy)
Baby I tried to be
(And I drove you crazy)
What are you looking for?
(And I drove you crazy)
Wanted to be your girl
(And I drove you crazy)
And anything you wanted
(And I drove you crazy)
I drove you crazy
(And I drove you crazy)
Baby I tried to be
(And I drove you crazy)
What are you looking for
(And I drove you crazy)
Wanted to be your girl
(And I drove you crazy)
In any way you wanted me
(And I drove you crazy)
Believe I tried to be
And I drove you crazy
And I drove you crazy
And I drove you crazy
And I drove you crazy
And I drove you crazy
And I drove you crazy
And I drove you crazy
And I drove you crazy
