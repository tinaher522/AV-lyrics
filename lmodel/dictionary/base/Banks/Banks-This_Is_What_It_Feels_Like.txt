<song artist="Banks" title="This_Is_What_It_Feels_Like">
I hang on everything that you say
You know I can see all the things that imply you secretly are in love
And finally when I let myself fall hard for you I
See you trying to pretend like I’m making it up
This is what it feels like
This is what it feels like
Bring it down
Bring it on
Bring it now
Bring it on
This is what it feels like now
It's getting old
Bring it down
Bring it on
Remember the first love that we made
You said that you couldn’t sleep 'cause of me
Told me I caught you off guard
And then when you saw I felt the same
You pulled away started acting like being with me was too hard
This is what it feels like
This is what it feels like
This is what it feels like
Bring it down
Bring it on
Bring it now
Bring it on
This is what it feels like now
It's getting old
Bring it down
Bring it on
Bring it down
Bring it on
Bring it now
Bring it on
This is what it feels like now
It's getting old
Bring it down
Bring it on
Bring it down
Bring it on
Bring it now
Bring it on
This is what it feels like now
It's getting old
Bring it down
Bring it on
