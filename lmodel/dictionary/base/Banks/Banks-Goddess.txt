<song artist="Banks" title="Goddess">
She gave it all, you gave her shit
She coulda done, just anything
Or anyone, 'cause she's a goddess
You never got this
You put her down, you liked her hopeless
To walk around, feeling unnoticed
You shoulda crowned her, 'cause she's a goddess
You never got this
Now you gotta deal with this glitch on your shoulder
Fuckin' with a goddess and you get a little colder
Yeah, it's colder, colder
Fuckin' with a goddess, and you get a little colder
Finally surfaced above the downs
Feeling her boldest, she came around
'Cause she's a goddess, finally saw this
And now you're back, trying to claim her
'Cause she is gone and now without her
You all alone, 'cause she's a goddess
You shoulda saw this
Now you gotta deal with this glitch on your shoulder
Fuckin' with a goddess and you get a little colder
Yeah, it's colder, colder
Fuckin' with a goddess, and you get a little colder
Now you gotta deal with this glitch on your shoulder
Fuckin' with a goddess and you get a little colder
Yeah, it's colder, colder
Fuckin' with a goddess, and you get a little colder
Now you gotta deal with this glitch on your shoulder
Fuckin' with a goddess and you get a little colder
Yeah, colder, colder
Fuckin' with a goddess, and you get a little colder
