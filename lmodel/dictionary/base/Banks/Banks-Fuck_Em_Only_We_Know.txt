<song artist="Banks" title="Fuck_Em_Only_We_Know">
I don't mind
Don't mind if everybody's far behind
Don't care if they can't understand the way
That you and I just want to be next to each other every day
You and I
We're just like magnets baby, hypnotized
Even addicted to your grumpy face
I know exactly just how many kisses fit between your eyes
I'd run away, I'd run away with you, would you run with me
Our life could be a little bumpy, but I'll hold on
Just wanna tell you that I see you, baby, do you see me
Cause this is special, baby
Fuck em only we know
Did I say
You're all that matters to me anyway
I'd give up everything to see your face
So come on, let's pretend that no one else is watching while we play
By your side
That's where I have to be now, we won't hide
I breathe your kisses just to stay alive
I see exactly what you think
I can feel you with my eyes
Only we know
Only we know
Only we know
Oh...
I'd run away, I'd run away with you, would you run with me
Our life could be a little bumpy, but I'll hold on
Just wanna tell you that I see you, baby, do you see me
Cause this is special, baby
Fuck em only we know
I'd run away, I'd run away with you, would you run with me
Our life could be a little bumpy, but I'll hold on
Just wanna tell you that I see you, baby, do you see me
Cause this is special, baby
Fuck em only we know
