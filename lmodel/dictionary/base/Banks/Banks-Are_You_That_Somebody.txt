<song artist="Banks" title="Are_You_That_Somebody">
Eheheheheheh eh eh...
Boy
I've been watching you
Like a hawk in the sky
That flies
And you were my prey
Boy, I promise you
If we keep bumpin' heads
I know that one of these days
We gone hook it up
Probably talk from the phone
But see I don't know if that's good
I've been holding back
This secret from you
I probably shouldn't letcha
If I
If I let you know
You can't tell nobody
I'm talking 'bout nobody
Are you responsible?
Boy you betta watch my body
I'm not just anybody
Is it my go, is it your go?
Sometimes I'm a goody goody
Right now I'm a naughty naughty
Say yes or say no
'Cause I really need somebody
Tell me are you that somebody, eh
Eheheheheheh eh eh...
Boy
Won't you pick me up at the park right now
Up the block while everyone
Sleep, sleep, sleep
I'll be waiting there
With my trench, my lugz, my hat
Just so I'm low key
If you tell the world
Oh boy
See I'm trusting you
With my heart, my soul
I probably shouldn't letcha, if I
If I
If I let you know
You can't tell nobody
I'm talking 'bout nobody
I hope you responsible
Boy you betta watch my body
I'm not just anybody
Is it my go, is it your go?
Sometimes I'm a goody goody
Right now I'm a naughty naughty
Say yes or say no
'Cause I really need somebody 
Tell me are you that somebody, eh
Eheheheheheh eh eh...
Baby girl
I'm the girl from the big L.A.
But you come play around my way
And listen to what I gotta say
UK
You've been down from the start
Thats why you got my heart
Ever since we departed
Baby girl
Betta known as Aaliyah
Them play haters have fevers
Getting goosebumps in our fevers
And don't you know
You gotta tell somebody
'Cause I really need somebody 
Tell me are you that somebody, eh
If I let you know
You can't tell nobody
I'm talking 'bout nobody
I hope you're responsible
Boy you betta watch my body
I'm not just anybody
Is it my go, is it your go?
Sometimes I'm a goody goody
Right now I'm a naughty naughty
Say yes or say no
'Cause I really need somebody
Tell me are you that somebody, eh
Eheheheheheh eh eh...
