<song artist="Banks" title="Warm_Water">
Looking you over and you don’t know my name yet
But by the time you looked away, already knew I couldn't fake it
I got this need for you, forming in my beating heart
I knew the meaning right away, we only yesterday were worlds apart
I think I may love you
If you give me some time
Maybe you'll love me, too
I got this thing for you
If you come closer I can whisper in your ear
And if you wanna walk away
I'll tell you all the things I know you wanna hear
I'll come closer to you
If you come over
I know we’ll go farther
Farther with you
With you I'm in warm water swimming down
I think I may love you
If you give me some time
Maybe you'll love me, too
I'll come closer to you
If you come over
I know we’ll go farther
Farther with you
With you I'm in warm water swimming
I'll come closer to you
If you come over
I know we’ll go farther
Farther with you
With you I'm in warm water swimming down
