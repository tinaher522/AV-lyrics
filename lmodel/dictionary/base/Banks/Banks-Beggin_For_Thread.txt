<song artist="Banks" title="Beggin_For_Thread">
So I got edges that scratch
And sometimes I don't got a filter, but
I'm so tired of eating all of my misspoken words
I know my disposition gets confusing
My disproportionate reactions fuse with my eager state
That's why you wanna come out and play with me, yeah!
Why?
Stooped down &amp; out, you got me beggin' for thread
To sew this hole up that you ripped in my head
Stupidly think you had it under control
Strapped down to something that you don't understand
Don't know what u were getting yourself into
You should have known, secretly, I think you knew
I got some dirt on my shoes
My words can come out as a pistol
And I'm no good at aiming, but I can aim it at you
I know my actions, they may get confusing
But my unstable ways is my solution to even space
That's why you wanna come out and play with me, yeah!
Stooped down &amp; out, you got me beggin' for thread
To sew this hole up that you ripped in my head
Stupidly think you had it under control
Strapped down to something that you don't understand
Don't know what u were getting yourself into
You should have known, secretly, I think you knew
Hold it out!
Try to hide it out
But my tracks are better
Hold it out!
Try to hide it out
But my tracks are better
Hold it out!
Try to hide it out
But my tracks are better
Hold it out!
Try to hide it out
But my tracks are better
Stooped down &amp; out, you got me beggin' for thread
To sew this hole up that you ripped in my head
Stupidly think you had it under control
Strapped down to something that you don't understand
Don't know what u were getting yourself into
You should have known, secretly, I think you knew
