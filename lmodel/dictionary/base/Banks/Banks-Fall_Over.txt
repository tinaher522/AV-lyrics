<song artist="Banks" title="Fall_Over">
You got my heart beating
Beating, beating, beating, beating, beating
You got my mind to follow
Follow, follow, follow, follow
Oh...
Follow...
I gave up
My pride - Why?
Why? Lay over
My motion says why
You got my heart beating
Beating, beating, beating, beating, beating
You got my mind to follow
Follow, follow, follow, follow
I gave up
My pride - Why?
I let you burn
My shelter - why?
