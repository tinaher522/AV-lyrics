<song artist="Banks" title="Alibi">
Something, someone
Turned out to be
Something I should've known
Will be the death of me
Baby, I tried
I promise I'm usually better than this
And now I can't even recognize myself anymore
You turned me into this
Please, give me something to
Convince me that I am not a monster
Babe, give me one excuse
Give me one excuse
(Give me one...
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...)
Please, give me something to
Convince me that I am not a monster
Babe, give me one excuse
Give me one excuse
Give me one, give me one, oh oh
Give me one, oh oh yeah, give me one, oh oh yeah
Give me one, give me one, oh oh yeah
Give me one, oh oh, give me one, oh oh yeah
