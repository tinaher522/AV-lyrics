Got a pinch of tobacco in my pocket
I'm not gonna roll it, no, I'm not gonna smoke it
'Til we're staring at the stars and the rockets
Twinklin' in the silvery night
Two sips of whiskey in the flask, but I'm not gonna drink 'em
I swear I'll make them last
'Til we're drinkin' out of the same glass, again
And though the sand may be washed by the sea
And the old will be lost in the new
Well, four will not wait for three
For three never waited for two
And though you will not wait for me
I'll wait for you
Got a Polaroid picture in my wallet
I'm not gonna to tear it, no, I'm not gonna spoil it
It's an unspoken heartbreak
A heartbroken handshake I take with me where I go
And three words on the tip of my tongue
Not to be spoken, nor sung
Or whispered to anyone
'Til I scream 'em at the top of my lungs again
And though the sand may be washed by the sea
And the old will be lost in the new
Well, four will not wait for three
For three never waited for two
And though you will not wait for me
I'll wait for you, oh woah, and oh, oh, woah
I'll wait for you, oh woah, and oh, oh, woah
And I'll wait for you, oh woah
Got a pinch of tobacco in my pocket
I'm not gonna roll it, no, I'm not gonna smoke it
'Til we're staring at the stars and the rockets
Twinklin' in the silvery night
