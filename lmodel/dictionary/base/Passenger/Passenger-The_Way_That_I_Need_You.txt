<song artist="Passenger" title="The_Way_That_I_Need_You">
He’s the deflated balloon wrapped around your gate
Cut priced to clear and past his “sell by" date
He’ll be the fool running through the church yard, screamin' out “it’s not too late”
When he does, I know that you’ll wait
He’s the drunk man with bad breath coming on too strong
He’s the beauty queen that strings your heart along
And he’ll answer every question in your new-age magazine wrong
But I know you love him strong
So I’m leaving before there’s nothing to believe in
I’m just greiving for a love I never knew
Please don’t go mistreating me
I’m not saying you’ve been misleading me
Just not needing me the way that I need you
He’s the elephant in the room that never speaks
But you dream about him every two weeks
And I wouldn’t know his name, but you call it in your sleep
Oh I know you love him deep
So run back to him like you should
I guess I always knew that you would
For he’s captured your heart in a way I never could
So go on and love him good
Oh I’m leaving for here’s nothing to believe in
I’m just greiving for a love I never knew
You’re the book I can’t stop reading
I’m the stray cat you've been feeding
But the tides they are receding now it’s true
So please don’t go mistreating me
I’m not saying you’ve been misleading me,
Just not needing me, the way that I need you
Just not needing me, the way that I need you
