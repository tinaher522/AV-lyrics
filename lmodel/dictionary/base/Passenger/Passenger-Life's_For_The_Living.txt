<song artist="Passenger" title="Life's_For_The_Living">
Well, grey clouds
Wrapped 'round the town like elastic
Cars stood like toys
Made of Taiwanese plastic
The boy laughed at the spastic
Dancing around in the rain
While laundrettes cleaned clothes
High heals rubbed toes
Puddles splashed huddles
Of bus stop crows
Dressed in their suits and their boots
Well, they all looked the same
I took myself down to the cafe
To find all
The boys lost in books and
Crackling vinyl
And carved out a poem
Above the urinal that read
Don't you cry for the lost
Smile for the living
Get what you need and
Give what you're given
Life's for the living, so live it
Or you're better off dead
While the evening
Pulled the moon out of it's packet
Stars shone like buttons
On an old man's jacket
We needed a nail
But we tacked it 'til it fell of the wall
While pigeon's pecked trains
Sparks flew like planes
The rain showed the rainbows
In the oil stains
And we all had new iPhones
But no one had no one to call
And I stumbled down
To the stomach of the town
Where the widow takes memories
To slowly drown
With a hand to the sky
And a mist in her eye, she said
Don't you cry for the lost
Smile for the living
Get what you need and
Give what you're given
Life's for the living, so live it
Or you're better off dead
Well, I'm sick of this town
This blind man's forage
They take your dreams down
And they stick 'em in storage
You can have 'em back, son
When you've paid off your mortgage and loans
Oh, hell with this place
I'll go it my own way
I'll stick out my thumb
And I trudge down the highway
Someday, someone
Must be going my way, home
'Til then I'll make my bed
From a disused car
With a mattress of leaves
And a blanket of stars
And I'll stitch the words into my heart
With a needle and thread
Don't you cry for the lost
Smile for the living
Get what you need and
Give what you're given
You know life's for the living, so live it
Or you're better off dead
Don't you cry for the lost
Smile for the living
Get what you need and
Give what you're given
Life's for the living, so live it
Or you're better off dead
