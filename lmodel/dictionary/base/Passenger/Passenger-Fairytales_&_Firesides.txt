<song artist="Passenger" title="Fairytales_&_Firesides">
We are bitter losers snarling through our smiles
We're the lost boys in the supermarket aisles
We're Christmas dogs dumped by the side of the road
Confused, we will run for miles
We are road rage
We are stone age
We are wild
We are busted light bulbs in a backstreet neon sign
We're the shaking gun in a service station line
We'll drink though we're drunk
We'll sink though we've sunk
We're fucked but we say we're fine
We are rampage
Missing back pages
In our spines
We long for journeys and the roadside
We long for starlight and the low tide
Yeah, we long for fairy tales and firesides
And oh
We are coffeehouse cynics, too righteous, too rigid to believe
Disappointed romantics scraping the hearts from our sleeves
We're the toothless drunk, we're the aging punk
Yeah we're Adam with the apple and we're Eve
We are beggars with shiny pennies on our knees
We long for sunlight on the hillsides
Yeah we long for yesterdays and high sign
Yeah we long for fairy tales and firesides
And oh
Yeah we long for carnivals and fairground rides
We long for journeys and the roadside
We long for fairy tales and firesides
