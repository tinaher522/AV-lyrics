<song artist="Passenger" title="Things_That_Stop_You_Dreaming">
I got no money in my hand
Or my coat or my pocket
Won't get to space
'Cause I haven't got a rocket
But I have air in my lungs
Eyes in my sockets
And a heart that beats
Like a tap that leaks
In the night when you haven't
Got a plumber who can stop it
Jack in a box without
A key to lock it
Well this boat may sink
But I'm not gonna rock it
'Cause the sea doesn't know my name
Yeah, the boat may sink
But I'm not gonna rock it
'Cause the sea doesn't know my name
Well if you can't get what you love
You learn to love the things you've got
If you can't be what you want
You learn to be the things you're not
If you can't get what you need
You learn to need the things that stop you dreaming
All the things that stop you dreaming
Well I got no one's word
And nobody's promise
Not a lot to show
But this book full of sonnets
And my liver may be fucked
But my heart is honest
And my word is true
Like the sky is blue
In the summer time when
Everybody gets on it
Warm my skin
'Till get sun burnt from it
And her eyes shine bright
Like a sky full of comets
That shoot like silver trains
Yeah her eyes shine bright
Like a sky full of comets
That shoot like silver trains
Well if you can't get what you love
You learn to love the things you've got
If you can't be what you want
You learn to be the things you're not
If you can't get what you need
You learn to need the things that stop you dreaming
Oh, all the things that stop you dreaming
Oh, oh, oh, oh no
And oh, oh, oh, oh oh
Oh oh, no, oh, oh, oh, oh no
Well if you can't get what you love
You learn to love the things you've got
If you can't be what you want
You learn to be the things you're not
If you can't get what you need
You learn to need the things that stop you dreaming
Oh oh, all the things that stop you dreaming
All the things that stop you dreaming
