<song artist="Passenger" title="Feather_On_The_Clyde">
Well, there's a river that runs through Glasgow
And it makes her, but it breaks her and takes her in two parts
And the current just like my blood flows
Down from the hills, 'round aching bones to my restless heart
Well, I would swim, but the river is so wide
And I'm scared I won't make it to the other side
Well, God knows I've failed, but He knows that I've tried
I long for something that's safe and warm
But all I have is all that is gone
I'm as helpless and as hopeless as a feather on the Clyde
Well, on one side all the lights glow
And the folks know, and the kids go where the music and the drinking starts
On the other side, where no cars go
Up to the hills that stand alone, like my restless heart
Well, I would swim, but the river is so wide
And I'm scared I won't make it to the other side
Well, God knows I've failed, but He knows that I've tried
I long for something that's safe and warm
But all I have is all that is gone
I'm as helpless and as hopeless as a feather on the Clyde
Well, the sun sets late in Glasgow
And the daylight and the city part
And I think of you in Glasgow
'Cos you're all that's safe, you're all that's warm in my restless heart
