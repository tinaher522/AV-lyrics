<song artist="Passenger" title="Bullets">
He's been collecting since the age of nine
Every shiny bullet that he could find
Built himself a house with wooden floors
Put the shiny bullets in a chest of drawers
His wife's long gone and the kids are grown
The trees they fall down on their own
Memories fade like an old slideshow
But the bullets still shine like coins in the snow
One day he took himself into town 
When the men with the truck came around
They took the television and the gun from the wall 
And almost every bullet from the chest of drawers 
When he came back home found the house in a mess
Running to the bedroom with the old brown chest 
Didn't care much for the VCR
But he cried for the space where the bullets were
The men took the truck down into town 
They sold all the silver they found
But they couldn't sell the bullets cause they weren't live rounds
So they dug a big hole and put the bullets in the ground
Well he doesn't leave the house much anymore
Cause the men are going come like they did before
And he'll hold onto the three or four 
Bullets that they left in the chest of drawers
Bullets that they left in the chest of drawers
