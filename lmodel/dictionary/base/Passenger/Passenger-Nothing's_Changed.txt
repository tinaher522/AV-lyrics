<song artist="Passenger" title="Nothing's_Changed">
Well the walls are turning yellow like a smoker's tooth,
Cold as a call girl's smile in a phone booth,
Baby pigeon starving on the side of the roof,
Nothing’s changed,
Sometimes words don’t say enough,
Sometimes silence says too much,
You're too close for comfort but too far too touch,
Nothing’s changed,
Sun still shining in the play ground,
Water still running like a greyhound,
My head's still drumming when I lay down,
Nothing's changed,
We still rattle round the same town,
Like two little stones in a coke can,
Like two lost kids at a fairground,
And nothing’s changed,
Car alarms ringing in the dead of the night,
Drunk man singing in the morning light,
We're too brave to fall but to scared to fight,
Nothing’s changed,
Sun still shining in the play ground,
Water still running like a greyhound,
My head's still drumming when I lay down,
Nothing's changed,
We’re just dancers waiting in the wings,
Ain’t no answers blowing in the wind,
Ain’t no saint and no sin,
And nothing's changed.
