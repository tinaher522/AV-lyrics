<song artist="Passenger" title="Holes">
I know a man with nothing in his hands
Nothing but a rolling stone
He told me 'bout when his house burnt down
And he lost everything he owned
He lay asleep for six whole weeks
They were gonna ask his mother to choose
When he woke up with nothing, he said, I'll tell you something
When you've got nothing, you've got nothing to lose
Now I've got a hole in my pocket
A hole in my shirt
A whole lot of trouble, he said
But now the money's gone
Life carries on
And I miss it like a hole in the head
I know a woman with kids around her ankles
And a baby on her lap
She said one day her husband went to get a paper
And the mother fucker never came back
Mortgage to pay and four kids to raise
But keeping the wolf from the door
She said the wolf's just a puppy and the door's double locked
So why you gotta worry me for?
Now he left a in hole in my heart
A hole in a promise
A hole on the side of my bed
Oh, now that he's gone
Well, life carries on
And I miss him like a hole in the head
Well, sometimes you can't change
And you can't choose
And sometimes it seems you gain
Less than you lose
Now we've got holes in our hearts
Yeah, we got holes in our lives
Well, we've got holes, we got holes
But we carry on
Well, we've got holes in our hearts
Yeah, we got holes in our lives
Well, we've got holes, we got holes
But we carry on
I said, we've got holes in our hearts
Yeah, we got holes in our lives
Well, we've got holes, we got holes
But we carry on
I said, we got holes in our hearts
We got holes in our lives
We got holes, we got holes
But we carry on, now
I said we got holes in our hearts
We got holes in our lives
We got holes, we got holes
But we carry on
I say, we got holes in our hearts
Yeah, we got holes in our lives
Well, we've got holes, we've got holes
But we carry on
