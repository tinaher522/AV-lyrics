<song artist="Passenger" title="Rainbows">
Glass was shattered here
A midst the burning smell of fear
Dressed in plain clothes
A bloodstain on the snow
Looks like red wine
On the clothes of a sailor
She lives in a photograph
Waits for you to make her laugh
Well life was shattered here
A midst a thousand mothers tears
We'll need rain clothes
And tear drop melt the snow
Reveal the oil spill in the road
Looks like rainbows
Drunk up on the scaffolding
Swinging around
Drunk up on the scaffolding
Laughing at the ground as he falls
