<song artist="Passenger" title="Keep_On_Walking">
Well, last night I couldn't sleep
I got up and started walking
Down to the end of my street
And on into town
Well I had no one to meet
And I had no taste for talking
Seems I'm talking my whole life
It's time I listen now
Well I walk passed the late night boys
With their bottles in their doorways
And I walk passed the business men
Sleeping like babies in their cars
And I thought to myself, "Oh, son
You may be lost in more ways than one"
But I've a feeling that it's more fun
Than knowing exactly where you are
Like a stone
Carried on the river
Like a boat
Sailing on the sea
I'll keep on walking
Oh, I'll keep on walking
Until I find that old love or that old love comes to find me
Well, I walked into the morning and felt the warm sunlight forming on my shoulders
'Cos it hit me with no warning like a summer sky storming in my lungs
Ain't it funny how the kids walk by?
They'll do anything to make themselves look older
While the women spend their money on anything that makes them look young
Like a stone
Carried on the river
Like a boat
Sailing on the sea
Oh, I'll keep on walking
Well, I'll keep on walking
'Til I find that old love or that old love comes to find me
Oh, lo lo
Oh, oh oh
Oh, lo lo
Oh, oh oh
Well I'm like a stone
And I'm carried on the river
Like a boat
Sailing on the sea
Oh, well I'll keep on walking
Well, I said I'll keep on walking, oh
'Til, I find that old love or that old love comes to find me
'Til, I find that old love or that old love comes to find me
