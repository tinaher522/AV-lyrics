<song artist="Passenger" title="Riding_To_New_York">
Well I met him in Minnesota
He was dark and overcast
With long, grey hair and eyes that stared
Through me like I was glass
I asked, "Where are you going to?"
He said, "I'm the wind, I'm just blowing through"
He lit up a cigarette and began to talk
See, the doctors told me that my body won't hold me
My lungs are turning black
Been a lucky strike's fool since I was at school
And there ain't no turning back
They can't tell me how long I've got
Maybe months, but maybe not
I'm taking this bike and riding to New York
'Cause I wanna see my granddaughter one last time
Wanna hold her close and feel her tiny
Heart beat next to mine
Wanna see my son and the man he's become
Tell him, I'm sorry for the things I've done
And I'd do it if I had to walk
I'm taking this bike and riding to New York
Through the forests of Wisconsin
That I knew as a boy
Past the sky line of Chicago
'Round the lakes of Illinois
I lay my head in a motel bed
Where my back is sore and my eyes turn red
And listen to the trucks roll past my door
Through the fields of Ohio
As the sunshine paints them gold
I run like a river runs
Rapid, quick and cold
And fly through Pennsylvania
And the Jersey turnpike tolls
And I won't stop 'til I get to New York
'Cause I wanna see my grandson one last time
Wanna see his eyes sparkling
And stare back into mine
Now my time is shorter, I wanna see my daughter
Tell her, I'm sorry for the things I taught her
And I'd do it if I had to walk
Oh I'm taking this bike, I'm riding to New York
And I'd go up to the churchyard
One last time
Lay flowers down for the woman who gave me
The best years of my life
And I'd do it if I had to walk
I'd do it if I had to walk
I'm taking this bike and riding to New York
