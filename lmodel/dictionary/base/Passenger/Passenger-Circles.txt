<song artist="Passenger" title="Circles">
It's been years since we
Carved our names on a
Clocktower door before
Everything changed
We were
Big-eyed boys with the
Salt on our skin and we'd
Throw our kites to the wind
And they'd fly on
And on and on and on
On and on and on and on
On and on and on and on
It's been years since we
Whispered soft with the
Torch light on and
The big light off
We were
Tired boys with the
Soap on our skin and we'd
Fall asleep to the wind
And we'd dream on
And on and on and on
On and on and on and on
On and on and on and on
'Cause we're circles
We're circles, you see
We go 'round, 'round the sun
In and out like the sea
I'll circle 'round you
You will circle 'round me
And in years, when the
Torch light thins and the
Clocktower's gone and
The big light dims
We'll no
Longer be boys; we'll have
Lines on our skin and they'll
Throw our dust to the wind
