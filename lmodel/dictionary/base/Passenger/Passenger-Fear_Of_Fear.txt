<song artist="Passenger" title="Fear_Of_Fear">
Fill my lungs full of smoke,
Fill my belly full of beer,
Fill my nights with bad jokes,
Told by folk full of fear,
Fill my eyes with a stinging,
Fill my time wishing she was here,
Fill my wide with a narrow,
Fill my safe full of danger,
Fill my bed full of shadows,
Fill my dreams full of strangers,
Fill my ears with a ringing,
Fill my heart with a fear of fear,
Well fill my cup half empty cos its never been half full,
Fill me up paint me over like a damp patch on the wall,
Leave me lying on my stomach on your neighbour’s bathroom floor,
I’m only here until tomorrow any way,
I’m burning up like a fever that rages in the night,
Spark me up I’m a fire work I’ll burst in to light,
For its better to burn out then to fade out of sight,
That’s what someone told me any way,
So fill my lungs full of smoke,
Fill my belly full of beer,
Fill my nose full of cocaine,
Fill my eyes full of tears,
Fill my short with a longing,
Fill my time wishing I wasn’t here,
Oh fill my past with regret,
Wrap my present in brown paper,
Fill my future with promises
That promise to come later,
Fill my heart with a stinging,
Fill my heart with a fear of fear.
