<song artist="Passenger" title="Strangers">
Well when you’re with your friends,
But you’re lonely,
You smile a smile that’s not your own,
When comfort comes from a stranger's arms,
Miles away from home,
And you close your eyes to feel a darkness,
You dream of love you have known,
But you wake up instead,
In a stranger's bed,
Miles away from home,
Though you’re in a house,
Don’t mean its a home,
Though you’re in a crowd,
Doesn’t mean you’re not alone,
Doesn’t mean you’re not alone,
And though he wraps you in wool,
You’re still freezing,
It’s been a while since you’ve been warm,
'Cos you’re making false starts,
With a stranger's heart,
Miles away from home
Though he’s on your skin,
Doesn’t mean he’s in your blood,
And though you let him in,
Doesn’t mean you’re making love,
Doesn’t mean you’re making love
'Cos you’re not in love
Oh, oh-oh
You’re not in love
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
You’re not in love
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
You’re not in love
In love, oh, oh-oh
'Cos you know my house,
will always be your home,
You know my heart,
Is yours and yours alone,
Is yours and yours alone,
You know my house,
Will always be your home,
You know my heart,
Is yours and yours alone,
Is yours and yours alone.
