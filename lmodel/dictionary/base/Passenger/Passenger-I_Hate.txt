<song artist="Passenger" title="I_Hate">
Well, I hate racist blokes, telling tasteless jokes
And explaining where people belong
I hate ignorant folks, that pay money to see gigs
And talk through every fucking song
I hate people in night clubs, snorting coke
And explaining where you're going wrong
Well, if you agree, then come hating with me
And feel free to sing along
And it goes:
La, ala, la, la, la
Ala, la, la, la
Ala, la, la, la
Ala, la, la, la
Ala, la, la, la
Ala, la, la, la
Alala, la, la
Wonderful, love it
And I hate pointless status updates on Facebook
FYI, we were never "m8"s
We pretend to be friends on the internet, when
In real life, we have nothing to say
To each other, oh, brother, I've love for my mother
For good times, for music, and my mates
Yeah, I laugh, and I live, and I have love to give
But, sometimes all you can do is hate
And it goes:
La, ala, la, la, la
Ala, la, la, la
Ala, la, la, la
Ala, la, la, la
Ala, la, la, la
Ala, la, la, la
Alala, la, la
Well, I hate them fussy eaters
You cook them fajitas
They only eat pizza and chips
I hate stepping outside for a smoke and some guy coughs
Like your lungs are his
And I hate queuing up for festival toilets
Especially when you need a shit
And I hate the X-Factor for murdering music
You bunch of money-grubbing pricks
And it goes:
La, ala, la, la, la
Ala, la, la, la
Ala, la, la, la
Ala, la, la, la
Ala, la, la, la
Ala, la, la, la
Alala, la, la
And I hate them magazines aimed at insecure teens
That make ten year olds race to grow up
Hey kids, let's all be anorexic or better
Eat chocolate until you throw up
Keep your Hollywood stars and their stupid cars
And the Botox that makes them look fucked
Just grow old with grace, have you seen Cher's face
It looks like it's been hit by a truck
And it goes:
La, ala, la, la, la
Ala, la, la, la
Ala, la, la, la
Ala, la, la, la
Ala, la, la, la
Ala, la, la, la
Alala, la, la
One more time, loud as you can
La, ala, la, la, la
Ala, la, la, la
Ala, la, la, la, la
Lala, la, la
Ala, la, la, la
Ala, la, la, la
Alala, la, la
Thank you so much, cheers
Thank you very much, indeed
