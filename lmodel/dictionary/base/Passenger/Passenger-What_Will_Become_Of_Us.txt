<song artist="Passenger" title="What_Will_Become_Of_Us">
Well wood burns and metal rusts
So darling, what's to become of us
When the weather turns and they say it must
Well we'll need coats for the both of us
But the wool is thin and it's full of holes
And there's no heat in this abandoned bus
So will we go alone, out on our own
Oh darling, what's to become of us
Well boats sink into the sea
And airplanes they crash like computer screens
And signals fail, trains derail
And car bonnets crumple like magazines
Till they're put in piles, like stacks of tiles
In a yard full of fridges and broken stuff
Will we go alone, out on our own
Oh darling, what's to become of us
We will bite our noses off, to spite our faces
Both of us, will rust like metal fences in the rain
You will pour the gasoline
And I will spark the matches
We will burn within our fire
We will burn within our flames
Well yeast ferments and milk sours
When it's out of the fridge for too many hours
Will we lament in separate towers
Never knowing if we're brave or if we're cowards
For they'll pour cement down this hole of ours
And we'll be stuck under stones and flowers
Will we go alone, out on our own
Oh darling, that's what will become of us
