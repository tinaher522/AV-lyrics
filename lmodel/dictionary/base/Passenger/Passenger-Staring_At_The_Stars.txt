<song artist="Passenger" title="Staring_At_The_Stars">
Tobacco stains our yellow teeth
And all our fingers and underneath
Our finger nails are glass bone sheets
As we try desperately to sleep
Hearts are saddened, eyes are tired
And all this Red Bull keeps us wired
It gives us wings, it gives us rings
Around our eyes
We put three sugars in our tea
Sit to watch day time TV
And laugh at moms who don't know
Who the father is
And all our girlfriends are long gone
We watch too much internet porn
Who needs love when you've got silicone
And strap-ons?
Beer bloats our spoiled guts
And shit jobs keep us in ruts
And keep us sighing up the whats and ifs
And buts and maybes and
Falling over in the street
It's just a part of every week
When we lie drunkenly
Just staring at the stars
Remember when they were in reach?
And all the teachers used to teach
You can do anything
If you put your mind to it
We put our minds to it all
But disappointment crashed the ball
We could have done anything
We just never quite knew it, soâ€¦
Tie your scarf on tight
It's to be a cold night
Tie your scarf on tight
It's to be a cold night
Tie your scarf on tight
It's to be a cold night
Tie your scarf on tight
It's to be a cold night
So tie your scarf on tight
It's to be a cold night
Tie your scarf on tight
It's to be a cold night
Tie your scarf on tight
It's to be a cold night
Tie your scarf on tight
It's to be a cold night
