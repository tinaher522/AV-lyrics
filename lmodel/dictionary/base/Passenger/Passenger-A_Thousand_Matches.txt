<song artist="Passenger" title="A_Thousand_Matches">
Lying on a mattress 'cause my friend's crazy sister took my bed away
Sleeping, she looked like an actress, a theory I didn't practice, I said "There's got to be a better way"
She said: "You light a thousand matches when you finally set fire, well you run away
So why'd you go and do it, when you knew that you would go and I would stay"
I hit the wall in frustration, a conversation I'd been circling for days
She said: "Don't take it out on him, for the wall has always been supportive in the best of ways"
We're laughing and crying like mad men dying in the snow
For just one second it was funny that she would have to stay and I would go
And I said: "I love you know, I love you so, when you love someone well you've gotta let 'em know"
She said: "Nothing's changed I love you the same, but when you love someone sometimes you gotta let 'em go"
She handed me a stone in the perfect shape of a heart
She said: "I'm gonna take this home for I know you'll only lose it somewhere after dark
In some faceless hotel room where you, seem to lose everything you own."
She didn't mean it how it sounded, what she meant was she would stay and I would go
And I said: "I love you know, I love you so, when you love someone well you've gotta let 'em know"
She said: "Nothing's changed I love you the same, but when you love someone sometimes you gotta let 'em go"
Sometimes you tear it all apart, to see the wood from the trees
Sometimes you break your own heart to set yourself free
I walked her to the station, hesitation in our movements and our tone
Words finally left after realising how uncomfortable they've grown
See what you want and what you need, well they seldomly succeed to grow
We reluctantly agreed that when you love someone, you've gotta let them go
