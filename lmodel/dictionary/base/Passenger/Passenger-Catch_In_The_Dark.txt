<song artist="Passenger" title="Catch_In_The_Dark">
Well she calls me up when she’s broken,
Says to leave my front door open,
I come home to find her smoking,
With her eyes all fragile and thin,
She’s always been hopeless at hoping,
Always coped badly with coping,
And I never know when she’s joking,
She never lets anyone in,
I know I’m a fool to let her run away with my heart,
And she’ll never tire of these games,
Loving her is like playing catch in the dark,
I’m a tear drop in an ocean of flames,
And we’ll drink too much for a Wednesday,
She’ll ask me why none of her men stay,
I tell her just what her friends say,
It never goes down too well,
And she’ll stay hear 'til late in the evening,
But she’s always arriving or leaving,
She never decides to believe in,
The people who know her so well,
I know I’m a fool to let her run away with my heart,
And she’ll never tire of these games,
Loving her is like playing catch in the dark,
I’m a tear drop in an ocean of flames,
Well she says if we’re single at 40,
We’ll get married and move to the country,
But I know she’ll never want me,
Then its five fifteen in the morning,
I reach for her whilst I’m yawning,
She leaves me with no warning.
