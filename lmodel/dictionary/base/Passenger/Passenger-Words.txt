<song artist="Passenger" title="Words">
Well the first time that I saw her
Standing in the middle of the road
Eyes as bright as Christmas lights
Wearing someone else’s clothes
Did my best to ignore her
But ignoring my best pretty soon
Spend the night all tangled tight
In an armchair in my friend's front room
I said darling you know, darling you know I can’t stay
'Cos I've given my heart and my word to a girl far away
I felt weak as she kissed my cheek, and sighed when I heard her say
Never knew I could get my heart broken in less than a day
Oh and the next time that I saw her
must have been a year or more
Face stained with mascara
Shiverin' outside my door
I did my best to assure her
But assurance ain’t easy to give
If you've never been sure of anything much
You get less so the longer you live
She said darling you know, darling you know I can’t stay
'Cos I've given my heart and my word to a boy far away
I spoke soft and pretended to cough, like I didn't care either way
Never knew I could get my heart broken, in so many ways
Well the last time that I saw her
Standing in the pouring rain
Hair a little shorter
But everything else looked the same
I could'a told her that I adored her
She could'a said she felt the same way
But we just smiled 'cos sometimes words
Aren’t the right words to say
We just smiled 'cos sometimes words
Aren’t the right words to say
