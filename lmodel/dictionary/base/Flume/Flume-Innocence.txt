<song artist="Flume" title="Innocence">
When you hold me
All your innocence, something broken
All your innocence when you hold me
You hold me
All your innocence, something broken
Broken
All your innocence when you hold me
You hold me
All your innocence, something broken
Broken
All your innocence when you hold me
You hold me
All your innocence, something broken
Broken
All your innocence...
(Yes, yes, yes, don't stop, stop, stop...)
When you hold me
All your innocence, something broken
Broken
All your innocence when you hold me
(Yes, yes, yes, yes....)
All your innocence, something broken
All your innocence....
(Yes, yes, yes, yes....)
Begin again, begin again
How do we begin again?
Start again, start again
How do we make it all a game?
Begin again, begin again
How do we begin again?
Start again, start again
How do we make it all a game?
How do we erase
And how do we evade
(Something broken, broken)
(All your innocence)
How do we erase
And how do we evade
(Something broken, broken)
(All your innocence)
All we want is a chance to give ourselves
Our way, our way
(All your innocence)
All we want is a chance to give ourselves
Our way, our way
(All your innocence)
