<song artist="Flume" title="On_Top">
All that I want in this life is the chance to do my thing
All that I want in this life is the chance to do my thing
Yeah
I want the top
All my people right there at the back of the spot
I need the top
If you know me y'all now need to stop
I need the top
All my people there back of the spot, now don't be shy
Yeah
And you don't just wake up rich one day
This kind of life never just slip your way
I gave up taking care free trips to the Bay
Cali banned us 'cause I got a flip in LA
Paris bound 'cause a new video's on the way
No breaks for me, no vaca's for me
I advance admit it before I live it
Watch out, they don't finish
I want the top
All my people right there at the back of the spot
I need the top
If you know me y'all now need to stop
I need the top
All my people there back of the spot, now don't be shy
Yeah
Drinks on chill, got drinks on chill
Lights get dim and I think I will
I work so hard that I think I will
Yeah, I had a long week, bitch, how you think I feel?
History favours the bulldog
Roast something, make sure my story gets told
Make sure our story gets told
The night's forever young, it's us that gets old
All that I want in this life is the chance to do my thing
All that I want in this life is the chance to do my thing
Yeah
I want the top
All my people right there at the back of the spot
I need the top
If you know me y'all now need to stop
I need the top
All my people there back of the spot, now don't be shy
Yeah
I want the top top top top top
All my people right there at the back of the spot
I need the top top top top top
If you know me y'all now need to stop
I need the top top top top top
All my people there back of the spot, now don't be shy
Yeah
Yeah
I want the top top top top top
All my people right there at the back of the spot
I need the top top top top top
If you know me y'all now need to stop
I need the top top top top top
All my people there back of the spot, now don't be shy
I want the top top top top top
All my people right there at the back of the spot
I need the top top top top top
If you know me y'all now need to stop
I need the top top top top top
All my people there back of the spot, now don't be shy
Yeah
(I feel what you got for me world)
Yeah
What you got got got got
