<song artist="Flume" title="Insane">
You don't have to be afraid
You don't even have to be brave
Living in a gilded cage
The only risk is that you'll go
Insane
Go insane
And go insane
Your mind is on track
For games we play these days
With every path we take
You know your safe, safe, safe
The only risk is that you'll go insane
The only risk is that you'll go insane
