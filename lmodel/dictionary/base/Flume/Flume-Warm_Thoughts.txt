<song artist="Flume" title="Warm_Thoughts">
Feel like jacking of the party
Hoes in the apartment
Rest the bones in the closet
Got a body like a goddess
Cradle for a day
Cause of that she was scar-less
Work at agriculture department
Yeah oh, from the garden
Fly mafioso ran through it
The drought was brand new
Trade ocean for water change
Two color charms, hand stand blueish
Shorty in the passenger side singing foolish
Go by the crew ship, blinking on the aven boom
Shorty's aroma, it's that new shit
That's the ride done
Said you don't want to feel the bass in your stomach
You on cause you off shit
Early morning fresh
Know you fucking with the best
Can barely see your steps
You just gotta say yes
Alarm clock rings
An empty cooler door
Smoke hit the ceiling
Let the ashes hit the floor
Throwing loose ones in the brown paper bag
I'm burning through funds cause life is such a drag
Throwing loose ones in the brown paper bag
I'm burning through funds cause life is such a drag
Throwing loose ones in the brown paper bag
I'm burning through funds cause life is such a drag
Throwing loose ones in the brown paper bag
I'm burning through funds cause life is such a drag
For all of y'all keeping young and hell
Just to live life and enjoy yourself
Cause it's cool when you fucking with a nigga let go
It's cool when you fucking with a nigga let go
For all of y'all keeping young and hell
Just to live life and enjoy yourself
Cause it's cool when you fucking with a nigga let go
It's cool when you fucking with a nigga let go
Just a young boy out of public housing
They say I wouldn't make it
Now I'm styling
Man for couldn't stand crystal violence
With that rumor cookie falling
You had my support, don't you want to spend
Spend some want support
I got a dark past and a bright future
So if you got nothing to do run the room
If you heard I fuck your bitch I probably run with you
I swear that thing came out on top
Can't cut right thing
All my niggas looking good and they just want
Even got my homie stylin while she cursing
My poppas such ill I wonder who raised me
My younger gone now he fin to have a baby
For now you can call me uncle smack a hoe
Bitch look falls you want to see a shuffle
For all of y'all keeping young and hell
Just to live life and enjoy yourself
Cause it's cool when you fucking with a nigga let go
It's cool when you fucking with a nigga let go
For all of y'all keeping young and hell
Just to live life and enjoy yourself
Cause it's cool when you fucking with a nigga let go
It's cool when you fucking with a nigga let go
