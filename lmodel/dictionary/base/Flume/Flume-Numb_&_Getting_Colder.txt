<song artist="Flume" title="Numb_&_Getting_Colder">
Make your decisions now
Weigh it up
Facing a long road down
Keeping your head above
Saying the same thing twice, won’t make it right
Held up in your desires, but
Maybe we're looking for different way
Does it matter when you act like this
Yeah, you got into something
Let it take control of you, oh
Cause you say it, but you won’t admit it, oh
Numb and getting colder, physical existence
Disappears
Said you begged to leave
I won’t be behind you
And I can’t breathe, breathe
I won’t be behind you
Said you begged to leave
I won’t be behind you
And I can’t breathe, breathe
I won’t be behind you
Not gonna tell you stop, ease it up
Hold your emotions back, stop taking it out on her
I'm gonna lose no pride, giving up
We're going on lockdown
But maybe you’re looking for a different way
Does it matter when you act like this
Yeah, you got into something
Let it take control of you, oh
Cause you say it, but you won’t admit it, oh
Numb and getting colder, physical existence
Disappears
Said you begged to leave
I won’t be behind you
And I can’t breathe, breathe
I won’t be behind you
Said you begged to leave
I won’t be behind you
And I can’t breathe, breathe
I won’t be behind you
If I feel like losing my mind
We're into deeper
Feelings often we leave behind
I'm too weak from this
Sometimes to get something refined
And trust your instincts
Broken, don’t do one thing, survive
So primitively
Said you begged to leave
I won’t be behind you
And I can’t breathe, breathe
I won’t be behind you
Said you begged to leave
I won’t be behind you
And I can’t breathe, breathe
I won’t be behind you
