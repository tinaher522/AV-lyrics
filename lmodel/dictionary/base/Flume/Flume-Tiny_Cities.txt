<song artist="Flume" title="Tiny_Cities">
Can I? Should I? Find my way home?
Now did I? Think I Better go home
All I said I needed was gone
But I thought I heard it all wrong
Now can it ever be the safe place?
When they never seem to forget
So admit it. More than you said
Grill it down inside of your head
Oh, she is following me in my head, but I am all alone
Thinking of her every time I want to try to let her go
But it's never easy when you think you have it in control
Somehow you get caught up in the moment and you never know
All these tiny cities that you're holding in your little hand
In the wind like diamond lights, they'll blow away in desert sand
It was never perfect, it was never meant to last
It was never perfect, it was never meant to last
It was never perfect, it was never meant to last
It was never perfect, it was never meant to last
It was never perfect, it was never meant to last
It was never perfect, it was never meant to last
It was never perfect, it was never meant to last
It was never perfect, it was never meant to last
It was never perfect, it was never meant to last
It was never perfect, it was never meant to last
Why can't I fall down into the ground (Gotta get it, Bae Bae)
Why can't I fall down into the ground (Gotta get it, Bae Bae)
Can I ever get ahead of what I want and what I need?
And what do I have to do to get away from what is killing me?
How can I convince myself to not believe in what I know?
When honesty is dominos falling uphill as we go
