<song artist="Flume" title="Space_Cadet">
Can't stop spacing, oh no
Can't stop spacing, on a daydream
Can't stop spacing, and when I'm on the cloud
My feet square on the ground
My head up in the clouds, looking down, out of this town
You know I gotta try
My fuckin' brain's on fire
Just gotta toke again, after that
Can't stop spacing out, oh no
Can't stop spacing, on a daydream
Yeah nigga, shoot 'em all, throw 'em right now
Starin' at ya sweatin' my wallys
My mind got vivid thoughts of what I'm supposed to be doin'
Got the blue and the cream, me and Rah blowin' steam
Sittin' with Tarrentin', nigga stackin' the green
Roll rockin', fan fuckin'
Snatchin' up mics at award shows, rollin' up O's
Wu clothes, my flows are so detrimental
Space cadet keep a cassette of instrumentals
Sling slang the track like 'dick the hoes'
Super intelligent, verbally diminish the pros
A visionary, my mind's like a rhyme war-zone
You can't postpone the inevitable, king of the thrones
Ghostface
Can't stop spacing, oh no
Can't stop spacing, on a daydream
Can't stop spacing, and when I'm on the cloud
My feet square on the ground
My head up in the clouds, looking down, out of this town
You know I gotta try
My fuckin' brain's on fire
Just gotta toke again, after that
Can't stop spacing out, oh no
Can't stop spacing, on a daydream
