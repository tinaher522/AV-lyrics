<song artist="Flume" title="Holdin_On">
To keep on holdin' on, holdin' on
To keep on holdin' on, holdin' on
Ya'll know (yes I do)
Alotta hip shaking, mama I love you (I know)
Can't turn you loose, no, no
Cause I need all the joy you bring, oh
Hey, I can't let you go with nobody
Cause I love you baby, yes I do
Don't give you everything I hope
Cause I gotta, gotta keep holdin' on, holdin' on
I can't, I can't (let you) let you go away no no, away, no no
You keep holdin' up, you keep holdin' up, holdin' on
I can't, I can't, I can't tell you
