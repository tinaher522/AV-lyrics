<song artist="Major_Lazer" title="Jessica">
My bathing suit's drying on the porsche
My mother is crying upstairs
It’s badman, you badman
And all I want is my Jessica
Mine Jessica, mine Jessican
Mein hessikan, mein hessikaner
Mine mine mine mine mine
You can let me off with a leash
I won’t come near ya, I won’t come near ya
Teach me to bark, teach me to speak
I won’t come near ya, I won’t come near ya
Some girls - they call the shots
Other girls might call you Schatz
But Jessica you’re the girl - I love you lots
I love your locks, and your lox, and your lakhs
And my physical looms on the schedule,
I wanna be healthy for you
I hope it’s not badman, you badman
Cause all I want is my Jessica
Mi Jessica
Mi jecessita coronita essica
Mein jessikaner jahtzenheimer hessika
Mine Jessica
Mine Jessica
You can let me off with a leash
I won’t come near ya, I won’t come near ya
Teach me to bark, teach me to speak
I won’t come near ya, I won’t come near ya
Some girls - they call the shots
Other girls might call you Schatz
But Jessica you’re the girl - I love you lots
I love your locks, and your lox, and your lakhs
Dein Gesicht
Und mein Gesicht
Könnten gute Freunde sein
Dein Gesicht
Und mein Gesicht
Könnten gute Freunde sein
Dein Gesicht
Und mein Gesicht
Könnten gute Freunde sein
Teach me to bark, teach me to speak
I won’t come near ya, I won’t come near ya
Some girls - they call the shots
Other girls might call you schatz
But Jessica you’re the girl - I love you lots
