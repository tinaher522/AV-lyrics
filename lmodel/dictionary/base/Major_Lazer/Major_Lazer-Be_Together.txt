<song artist="Major_Lazer" title="Be_Together">
Let me escape in your arms
Baby I'm yours, baby I'm yours
Love don't come easy at all
I missed you so much, I miss you so much
Tell me, is this freedom, baby?
Chasing after danger, making my heart race, woah
Maybe if the stars align, maybe if our worlds collide
Maybe on the dark side, we could be together, be together
Maybe in a million miles, on a highway through the stars
Someday soon we'll be together
He was a dreamer at heart
Chasing the stars, chasing the stars
Wings spread to the sun
I missed you so much, I miss you so much
Tell me, is this freedom, baby?
Chasing after danger, making my heart break, woah
Maybe if the stars align, maybe if our worlds collide
Maybe on the dark side, we could be together, be together
Maybe in a million miles, on a highway through the stars
Someday soon we'll be together
We'll be together, we'll be together
We'll be together, we'll be together
We'll be together, we'll be together
We'll be together, we'll be together
Maybe if the stars align, maybe if our worlds collide
Maybe on the dark side, we could be together, be together
Maybe in a million miles, on a highway through the stars
Someday soon we'll be together
Maybe if the stars align, maybe if our worlds collide
Maybe on the dark side, we could be together, be together
Maybe in a million miles, on a highway through the stars
Someday soon we'll be together
