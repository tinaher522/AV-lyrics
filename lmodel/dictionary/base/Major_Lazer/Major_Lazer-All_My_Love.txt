<song artist="Major_Lazer" title="All_My_Love">
Some times I think we're the brightest stars
And I try to believe we'll find a way
Will life change, will our hearts turn colder?
(Major Lazer)
All the rhythms in my heart lift me up inside
We can stay out of the trouble is it worth the blame?
Is it true that the more you give the more they take?
All the rhythms in my heart lift me up and say
Only love will make us ache
Only love is worth the chase
All my love I know we're waiting for this
On the rocks up on the mountain tops
All my love
All my love
All my love
Up on the mountain top
All the rhythms in my heart lift me up and say
We're just a mess of broken people but we love the game
I would do anything for us, it's worth the pain
All the rhythms in my heart lift me up and say
Only love will make us ache
Only love is worth the chase
All my love I know we're waiting for this
On the rocks up on the mountain tops
All my love
All my love
All my love
Up on the mountain top
You're always on my mind, oh there'll come a day
Day where we can fly, reach the glory gaze
High up in the sun and by the sky, sun and by the sky
Only love will make us ache
Only love is worth the chase
All my love I know we're waiting for this
On the rocks up on the mountain tops
All my love
All my love
All my love
Up on the mountain top
