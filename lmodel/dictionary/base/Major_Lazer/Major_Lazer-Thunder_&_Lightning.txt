<song artist="Major_Lazer" title="Thunder_&_Lightning">
Babylon you're throne tumble down
And you
Thy walls are now shaken by
Lightning, earthquake, and thunder
Babylon your torn on the ground
And you
Thy walls are now shaken by
Lightning, earthquake, and thunder
Babylon you're throne tumble down
And you
Thy walls are now shaken by
Lightning, earthquake, and thunder
Babylon you're torn on the ground
And you
The Lord is coming again
With water, and brimstone, and fire
Fire burn!
Major Lazer ???
They think it's danger!
The lightning, thunder, brimstone and fire!
Wicked bound to retire!
Run away Babylon, run away as I would say!
Doo, baba-doo, baba-day
??? selector!
Bring ??? to the very last Jah!
Babylon you're throne tumble down
And you
Thy walls are now shaken by
Lightning, earthquake, and thunder
Babylon you're torn on the ground
And you
The Lord is coming again
With water, and brimstone, and fire
