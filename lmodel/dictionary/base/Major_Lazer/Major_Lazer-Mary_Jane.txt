Now this is a story about my girlfriend Mary Jane,
(Mwaa hahahaha Mwaaa hahahah!)
You ready mini me?? Okaay,
Hello, Mary Jane, I can't get you off my brain
Take me higher then a crane
You're so sweet like sugarcane (cane)
(I'll keep on flyin...)
Mary Jane!
Mary, Mary, quite contrary
Girl you must be my fairy
You give me wings like a canary
Mary Jane I love you dearly!
I always want you near me
You make me see clearly like
Jimmy spliff, I mean, Jimmy Cliff!
Mary Jane I love you so, I wont ever let you go
Mary Jane I need you so, I wont ever let you go
Mary Jane I love you so, I wont ever let you go
Mary Jane I need you so, I wont ever let you go
Load it, twist it, light it up
Load it, twist it, light it up
Load it, twist it, light it up
(Mwaaa hahahahahha!)

My Boyfriend's name is Jay,
Everyday we spark a brain
Yes I am the queen of sheekah
Mary Jane everynight I meet her
In the club is superrr
Johnny plays "Goodmorning Sir"
I feel nice but don't get fast
Kid, don't you know about the "puff, puff, pass?"
Hey Mr. Tamborine Man!
Yes he loves me even when I got the munchies
He might come quick,
So I suck is vooda stick
Roll it, twist it, spark it up
Roll it twist it, spark it up
Okay...
Roll it twist it spark it up
