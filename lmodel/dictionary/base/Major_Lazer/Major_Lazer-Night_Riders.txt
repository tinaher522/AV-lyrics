<song artist="Major_Lazer" title="Night_Riders">
You need to know that I'm a rider
Tonight we gonna set the streets on fire
(Major Lazer) Word
Straight up
Outlaw, outlaw, like I hit the PowerBall
Once all eyes is on me, floating off like Southpaw
Niggas love to count yours, hoping that your people fall
Wishing death upon me, but I'm here forevermore
I just get debated on, I just get my greatest on
Saint Laurent on speed dial, I just put the latest on
Bring it on, bring it on, you want war, then bring it on
Set this bitch on fire, nigga, we can have a sing-along
You need to know that I'm a rider
Tonight we gonna set the streets on fire
All I need is a gas and a lighter
And we'll have one hell of a time
You need to know that I'm a rider
Tonight we gonna set the streets on fire
All I need is a gas and a lighter
And we'll have one hell of a time
Got a California king in my condo
Got a motherfucking big screen by the front door
Got a guest bedroom filled up with fur coats
Nigga, ain't no room in this bitch to even jump rope
Yeah, the fire and desire and I'm higher than my prior
My attire I acquire might require a Maliah
Whoa, might accept ya and deny ya, no denial
I'll be in the court room on the table screaming, "Rider"
You need to know that I'm a rider
Tonight we gonna set the streets on fire
All I need is a gas and a lighter
And we'll have one hell of a time
You need to know that I'm a rider
Tonight we gonna set the streets on fire
All I need is a gas and a lighter
And we'll have one hell of a time
Tell them likkle pussy deh nuh violate, violate
21 outta di clip me fire straight
White line, yellow tape, book your flight, look a date
Send di pussy back to di maker, whether hell or higher gate, yeah
Clip big, diss badman, you get a split wig, split wig
Undertaker look see what a sick did
West coast, East coast, we love weapons
Bullet through your fucking vest left your chest exposed
You need to know that I'm a rider
Tonight we gonna set the streets on fire
All I need is a gas and a lighter
And we'll have one hell of a time
You need to know that I'm a rider
Tonight we gonna set the streets on fire
All I need is a gas and a lighter
And we'll have one hell of a time
All we do is relax, sit back and smoke
We ain't got no job, we going from broke
That ain't stopping from getting, getting inside of ya
Taking off in our cars, feel like we in the air screaming
You need to know that I'm a rider
You need to know that I'm a rider
Tonight we gonna set the streets on fire
All I need is a gas and a lighter
And we'll have one hell of a time
