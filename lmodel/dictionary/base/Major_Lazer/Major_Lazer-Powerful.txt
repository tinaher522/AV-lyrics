<song artist="Major_Lazer" title="Powerful">
Oh my my my what you do to me
Like lightning when I'm swimming in the sea
From the very first time we loved 
From the very first time we touched
Walking on wires and power lines
When you put your body on top of mine
Everytime that you lift me up
To the heaven and stars above
O Lord of mercy
I'm beggin you please
I'm feelin drained
I need love
You torch me up like electricity
Jumpstart my heart with your love
There's an energy
When you hold me
When you touch me
It's so powerful
I can feel it
When you hold me
When you touch me
It's so powerful
There's an energy
When you hold me
When you touch me
It's so powerful
I can feel it
When you hold me
When you touch me
It's so powerful
I couldn't leave if I wanted to
Cause something keeps pulling me back to you
From the very first time we loved 
From the very first time we touched
The stroke of your fingers
The scent of your lingers
My mind running wild
With thoughts of your smile
Oh you gotta give me some
You could give it all
But it's never enough, no
There's an energy
When you hold me
When you touch me
It's so powerful
I can feel it
When you hold me
When you touch me
It's so powerful
I can feel it
When you hold me
When you touch me
It's so powerful
There's an energy
When you hold me
When you touch me
It's so powerful
I can feel it
When you hold me
When you touch me
It's so powerful
I can feel it
When you hold me
When you touch me
It's so powerful
When you hold me
In your arms
Burns like fire
And electricity
When you're close
I feel the sparks
Takes me higher
To infinity
