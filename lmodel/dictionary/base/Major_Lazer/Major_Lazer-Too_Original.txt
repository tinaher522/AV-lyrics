<song artist="Major_Lazer" title="Too_Original">
Ass move, Kingston massive, we ready?
London massive, we ready?
Trinidad massive, we ready?
African massive, we ready, so
I'mma blaze high 'til the day I die
Sweat the shit out, every tear, every lie
Hey, anybody wanna dance with me?
Sipping on my rum in the corner still (ah!)
We a groove to the morning break
Na we go banana ina suga shake
Bring the base up, make a blasta block
Selecta gonna feed us with a well-cocked rock
See me see me see me, I'm a bim see me swing
Ting tangue swinging like a tingeling
I'm a twang my body till the problems gone
Drop baba juice, make it goddamn strong
See me rocking out, going tribal style
Dance like a chicken, flap tiger wild
Ah, flap tiger wild
Too original fi dem pawdie
Dem frighten all true dem saw mi
Dance like a chicken flap tiger wild
Come come closer tell a secret boy
Dip you like a dumplin in a cup of soy
Man a crispy don't mean to be ruff
But I really can't stay naah, can't get enough
Puff puff puff, and I'm back to di heat
Loving it living 128 beat, hey
Naah shake your meat
Enemy or friend is not an option, ah
We all the same when we go dancing stars
Simsalabim naah, I'm a norden gyal
Bim bim sala, kicking dreadlock style
Hunt the reflection from a disco ball
Mayham rumble 'til I drop and fall
Pump up bumble bee
Swetty honey
Too original fi dem pawdie
Dem frighten all true dem saw mi
Dance like a chicken flap tiger wild
I just wanna shine
Just like the diamonds ina di sky
And I really don't care
I love to watch the smoke dance ina air
[?]
Whistle, whistling
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up, turn it up
Dance like a chicken flap tiger wild
[?] Major Lazer style
I love to watch the smoke dance ina air
