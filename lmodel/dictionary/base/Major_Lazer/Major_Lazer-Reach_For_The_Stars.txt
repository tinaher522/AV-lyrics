Reach for the stars
First you got to have a vision
Reach for the highest
If you could see it, you could be it
And I know you can get there
One day yea yea, one day yea yea
Reach for the stars
First you got to have a vision
Reach for the highest
If you could see it, you could be it
And I know you can get there
One day yea yea, one day yea yea
When the sun sets, the moon shines
Her Instagram pics stop time
Now scatter, runnin down the aisles
And she keep the payment short
And while she lookin at her stomach in the mirror
She ain’t like the way, she look so, she got a tummy tuck for the summer
And as ironical, moronical, we all wanted a piece of
She used to roam the block and I’d do anything to get to her
‘Cause hip-hop got the toll on me
And still one time killing me softly
But welcome to the school where everybody keep a sawed off
And dude took his own life
He didn’t wanna get bullied no more
Young world – you gotta be strong
Just when you wanna give up that’s when a story’s born
Reach for the stars
First you got to have a vision
Reach for the highest
If you could see it, you could be it
And I know you can get there
One day yea yea, one day yea yea
Reach for the stars
First you got to have a vision
Reach for the highest
If you could see it, you could be it
And I know you can get there
One day yea yea, one day yea yea
My brothers was the greatest debaters, they used to debate philosophy
Ever since Obama won we been having a tea party
And now Mr. Jackson found where my daughter’s signing her ABC’s
And now I’m sippin wine in the house thinking of Remy
Teenage love, look at them whole heads
They’re from the school of rock, battle of the bands
So if you’re ever down, listen to this song
You don’t want em singing about a star is born
Reach for the stars
First you got to have a vision
Reach for the highest
If you could see it, you could be it
And I know you can get there
One day yea yea, one day yea yea
Reach for the stars
First you got to have a vision
Reach for the highest
If you could see it, you could be it
And I know you can get there
One day yea yea, one day yea yea
I know
I know oh oh oh
I know
I know oh oh oh
I know
Reach for the stars!
I know oh oh oh
Alright
I know
Reach for the stars!
I know
I know oh oh oh
I know oh oh oh
