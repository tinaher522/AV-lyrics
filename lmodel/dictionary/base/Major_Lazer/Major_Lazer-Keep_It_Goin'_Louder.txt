<song artist="Major_Lazer" title="Keep_It_Goin'_Louder">
Me and my friends rollin like rockstars,
So we by the bar.
All eyes on us girls watchin from far,
We shining through the dark.
Saw this sexy little thing she was biting her lips,
Working at me hard.
So I just went over there and just whispered in her ear
Do you wanna start?
Chorus x2
Girl i wanna party with you,
Girl i wanna party with you,
I've got the girls in the truck bout six chicks deep,
And you know girls we rollin with is straight sexy.
Tonight can you keep up?
When we hit the dance floor you know we turn the heat up.
Its like the roof on fire everyones desire,
All eyes on us DJ turn it up.
I've heard you play before but tonight we goin harder,
So DJ play my song and keep it going louder.
I've heard you play before but tonight we goin harder,
So DJ play my song and keep it going louder.
Chorus x2
Girl i wanna party with you,
Girl i wanna party with you,
I've got the girls in the truck bout six chicks deep,
And you know girls we rollin with is straight sexy.
Keep it going louder x4
No time don't matter.
Cause tonight we'll gather.
I've got the girls in the truck bout six chicks deep,
And you know girls we rollin with is straight sexy.
Chorus x4
Girl i wanna party with you,
Girl i wanna party with you,
I've got the girls in the truck bout six chicks deep,
And you know girls we rollin with is straight sexy.
