Collie Buddz
It's never ever good enough for you
I got this strange little feeling
That my words ain't appealing to you
Not good enough for you
Me love the music &amp; so me dweet
Me smoke herb cause it's sweet a nuh true
Good enough For you
Me can't fight the feeling that my words ain't appealing to you
Not good enough for you
Me love the music &amp; so me dweet
Me smoke weed cause it's sweet a nuh true
Lindi Ortega
Burn it up in the atmosphere
Watch the smoke, rise up, where do we go from here
Why did I think that the truth would become clear
I tell you how i feel, you say it's insincere
We try baby but were going south
I try baby but your full of doubt
So tell me what am I to do right now?
Light it up, light it up, and hope it don't burn out!
Cause every little high we hit 
We never make the most of it
You always think I'm talking shit
I swear, I mean every word of it
Light it up, light it up, light it up 
Light it up, light it up, light it up!
Collie Buddz
'Cause it's never ever good enough for you
I got this strange little feeling
That my words ain't appealing to you
Not good enough for you
Me love the music and so me dweet
Me smoke herb 'cause it's sweet a nuh true
Good enough For you (Good enough for you)
Me can't fight the feeling that my words ain't appealing to you
Not good enough for you (Good enough for you)
Me love the music and so me dweet
Me smoke weed 'cause it sweet a nuh true
