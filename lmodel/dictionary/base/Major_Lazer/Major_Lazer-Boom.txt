<song artist="Major_Lazer" title="Boom">
Baby got ass like a trunk,
Took her from her man, he a punk
She got a body like Baywatch
I met her at the playhouse
Ten bottles, bought ten more
Told her move her ass to the tempo
Is you really with the shit, though?
Really, is you really with the shit, though?
We got champagne and vodka
Fuck niggas, ain't real niggas, get money
All muhfucking day
Baby drop it to the ground like yass, bitch
Back it up like yass, bitch
Back of the club, I'mma smash it
pass it
Girl, please, please, baby, don't leave
You got that booty, booty boom bam ba
Baby give me that boom bam ba
Baby girl, please, please, baby, don't leave
You got that booty, booty boom bam ba
Baby give me that boom bam ba
Me no even give a fuck
Take her roadside, go smash it by the avenue
Two of my bitches in the club
Me introduce them to each other, other, other
When a girl is ... forever
Girl, please, please, baby, don't leave
You got that booty, booty boom bam ba
Baby give me that boom bam ba
Baby girl, please, please, baby, don't leave
You got that booty, booty boom bam ba
Baby give me that boom ba ba
