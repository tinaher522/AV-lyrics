<song artist="Major_Lazer" title="You're_No_Good">
You’re no good for me
But the way you movin at me, oh it might be
You want a Jamaican one
She say she love me and I’m nice
Nothing after he return, nothing at the night
She say it’s loving, make this down
No time at all, she don’t wanna line
She touch me, it all become nice
She love me, for the rest of her life
D drop it down, round kiss on mi spine
Touch and make a sweet song, on top of all things
My uh uh uh uh uh
My ee ee ee ee ee
My uh uh uh uh uh (my baby)
My ee ee ee ee ee
My aa aa aa aa me
My melodea
My L L L LSD
I know you’ll come back around
My aa aa aa aa me
My melodea
My L L L LSD
You want a Jamaican one
I know you’ll come back around
If I had you back
I’ll never let you go another way
Not for the life of me
How could you imagine that?
Well my mistake that send you on your way
Well nothing I can say
To you like drops of water
Don’t ask me what went wrong
Can’t turn back the damage I’ve done
Can’t take em back after I’m gone
A fool to keep on trying
Can’t make me walk away
‘Cause baby I’m back and as I’m getting strung that you’ll be back one day
My aa aa aa aa me
My melodea
My L L L LSD
I know you’ll come back around
My aa aa aa aa me
My melodea
My L L L LSD
You want a Jamaican one
I know you’ll come back around
Girl you think you love me baby
And you know so mi love is for my lady
Deserve no faith to deserve no Slim Shady
Go Shawty, it’s yo birthday
No if and no maybe
Take and attack it, you’re the thing, ordinary
Me as boyfriend, girl come on and come save me
Me and you’re tinking me, com e with me
Surely inside the long shorty
Til it wind, pan the flow and wind, pan the flow
And if you want to get girls that do me
Come here, lick it more, lick it more
Mean everything, as I me love you
So no one kill how I ever want
Any time, get chug upon the doorway
Man rest assured, pan the girl next door
Oh yes I did did
My uh uh uh uh uh
My melodea
My ee ee ee ee ee
I know you’ll come back around
My uh uh uh uh uh
My melodea
My ee ee ee ee ee
I know you’ll come back around now
You’re no good for me
But the way you movin at me, oh it might be
No one ever made me feel so sweet
Now you got me begging on my knees
Baby get it for me
It’s for your eyes only, living for you solely
It’s for your eyes only, living for you solely
It’s for your eyes only, living for you solely
It’s for your eyes only, living for you solely
It’s for your eyes only, living for you solely
It’s for your eyes only, living for you solely
It’s for your eyes only, living for you solely
It’s for your eyes only, living for you solely
It’s for your eyes only, living for you solely
It’s for your eyes only, living for you solely
It’s for your eyes only, living for you solely
It’s for your eyes only, living for you solely
My aa aa aa aa me
My melodea
My L L L LSD
I know you’ll come back around
My aa aa aa aa me
My melodea
My L L L LSD
You want a Jamaican one
I know you’ll come back around
My aa aa aa aa me
My melodea
My L L L LSD
I know you’ll come back around
My aa aa aa aa me
My melodea
My L L L LSD
You want a Jamaican one
I know you’ll come back around
My aa aa aa aa me
