<song artist="A_Great_Big_World" title="You'll_Be_Okay">
You'll be okay
You'll be okay
The sun will rise
To better days
And change will come
It's on it's way
Just close your eyes
And let it rain
'Cause you're never alone
I will always be there
You just carry on
You will understand
You'll be okay
You'll be okay
Just look inside
You know the way
Let it go
Fly away
And say goodbye
To yesterday
'Cause you're never alone
And I will always be there
You just carry on
You will understand
And I will be strong
When love is gone
I'll carry on...
You'll be okay
You'll be okay
The sun will rise
To better days
You'll be okay
You'll be okay
Just close your eyes
And let it rain
When you need it the most
And all you've got is a prayer
You must carry on
You will understand
You will understand
You will understand
You'll be okay
You'll be okay
You'll be okay
