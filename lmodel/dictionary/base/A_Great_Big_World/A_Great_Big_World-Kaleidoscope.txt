<song artist="A_Great_Big_World" title="Kaleidoscope">
My life, my life was black and white
And I believed it, I believed it
My eyes, my eyes looked at the world
But couldn't see it, I couldn't see it
You're like the thing that makes the universe explode
Into the colours of a world I've never known
You keep turning, keep turning my life around
Violets and purples
Diamonds and circles
You're my kaleidoscope
I love every minute
You've got me in it
You're my kaleidoscope
You keep turning, keep turning my life around
You keep turning, keep turning my life around
Tonight, the stars are in your eyes
And I surrender, I surrender
Tonight, our hands against the wind
We are forever, we are forever
It all looks better when I see it with you here
You keep turning, keep turning my life around
Violets and purples
Diamonds and circles
You're my kaleidoscope
I love every minute
You've got me in it
You're my kaleidoscope
You're my kaleidoscope
You keep turning, keep turning my life around
You keep turning, keep turning my life around
I closed my eyes to the orange skies
Living all of my days the same
Then you came along and you sang your song
And the whole world around me changed
Violets and purples
Diamonds and circles
You're my kaleidoscope
I love every minute
You've got me in it
You're my kaleidoscope
You keep turning, keep turning my life around
You're my kaleidoscope
You keep turning, keep turning my life around
You're my kaleidoscope
You're my kaleidoscope
You're my kaleidoscope
