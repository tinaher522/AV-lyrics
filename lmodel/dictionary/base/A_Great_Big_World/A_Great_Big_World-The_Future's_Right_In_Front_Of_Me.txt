<song artist="A_Great_Big_World" title="The_Future's_Right_In_Front_Of_Me">
I spent my life trying to answer to the voice inside my head
But all I found were empty questions from a time that I forget
I learned my lesson, it was wrong of me to look so far ahead
I count my blessings one by one, I'll live a life I won't regret
And now I finally see
The future's right in front of me, yeah
And now I finally see
The future's right in front of me, yeah
I walked alone, I was scared of who I knew that I could be
But there was beauty in the darkest parts of my uncertainty
And now I finally see
The future's right in front of me, yeah
And now I finally see
The future's right in front of me, yeah
I feel it beating in my heart
The future's right in front of me, yeah
I feel it beating in my heart
The future's right in front of me, yeah
I feel it beating in my heart
I feel it beating in my heart
I feel it beating in my heart
The future's right in front of me, yeah
I feel it beating in my heart
The future's right in front of me, yeah
And now I finally see
The future's right in front of me, yeah
And now I finally see
The future's right in front of me, yeah
And now I finally see
The future's right in front of me, yeah
And now I finally see
The future's right in front of me, yeah
And now I finally see
The future's right in front of me, yeah
And now I finally see
The future's right in front of me, yeah
And now I finally see
The future's right in front of me
