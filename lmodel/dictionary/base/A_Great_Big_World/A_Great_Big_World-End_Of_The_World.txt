<song artist="A_Great_Big_World" title="End_Of_The_World">
I'm gonna love you (love you)
I'm gonna love you (love you)
I'm gonna love you (love you)
Like it's the end of the world
I wanna remember the shape of your lips
Cause I wouldn't miss breathing as much as your kiss
If the streets were on fire, well, we'd never know
We'd be lost in each other instead of the smoke
Baby, let's go out with a bang
We could be the last love song ever sang
I'm gonna love you (love you)
Love you like it's the end of the world
I'm gonna hold you (hold you)
Hold you as long as I can in this world
So let's cheers to the moments of beauty we've found
As the city burns to the ground
I'm gonna love you (love you)
I'm gonna love you (love you)
We'll live forever; they'll study our bones
Write stories about us and carve us in stone
So they can remember what true love was like
But this isn't about them; it's just us tonight
Baby, let's go out with a bang
We could be the last love song ever sang
I'm gonna love you (love you)
Love you like it's the end of the world
I'm gonna hold you (hold you)
Hold you as long as I can in this world
So let's cheers to the moments of beauty we've found
As the city burns to the ground
I'm gonna love you (love you)
I'm gonna love you (love you)
Be here now as the skies crash down
Watch the world fade away (watch it fade away)
Cause what we've found never comes around
Let it burn up in flames (let it all go up in flames)
I'm gonna love you (love you) (Be here now)
Love you like it's the end of the world (As the sky's falling down)
I'm gonna hold you (hold you) (Let it burn)
Hold you as long as I can in this world (up in flames)
I'm gonna love you (love you) (Be here now)
Love you like it's the end of the world (As the sky's falling down)
I'm gonna hold you (hold you) (Let this all)
Hold you as long as I can in this world (fade away)
(Love love love love you)
