<song artist="A_Great_Big_World" title="I_Really_Want_It">
So tell me what are we living for?
I say we chuck inhibitions
And sell our souls to rock and roll
I need to know what I'm missing
So turn it up on the stereo
Somebody light the ignition
What the hell are you waiting for?
It's time to make a decision
(Nah-oooh)
I'm feeling the world go round
It's spinning me upside down
I'm finally homeward bound
I'm not giving up
It's crawling under my skin
And I don't care if I sin
I really want it
I really want it
I really want it right now
I really want it right now
If there's a maker up above
Then why is nobody listening
You show me hate, and I'll show you love
It's not about your religion
We're always lookin' to someone else
Just take a look in the mirror
'Cause all you need is inside yourself
It couldn't be any clearer
(Nah-oooh)
I'm feeling the world go round
It's spinning me upside down
I'm finally homeward bound
I'm not giving up
It's crawling under my skin
And I don't care if I sin
I really want it
I really want it
I really want it right now
I really want it right now
The more we love, the more we learn
The more we love, the more we burn
The more we love
So tell me what are we livin' for
I say we chuck inhibitions
And sell our souls to rock n' roll
I need to know what I'm missin'
I'm feeling the world go round
It's spinning me upside down
I'm finally homeward bound
I'm not giving up
It's crawling under my skin
And I don't care if I sin
I really want it
I really want it
I really want it right now
I really want it right now
