<song artist="A_Great_Big_World" title="One_Step_Ahead">
How many times did I miss the signs?
My stupid heart, it left me blind
Nobody else would forgive my mistakes
Nobody else would have stayed
One step ahead of me
You saw what we could be
How did you know, down in your bones,
That I'd come around?
One step ahead always
Guiding me through my haze
Was too scared to see what this could mean
But I see it now
I see it now
How could I ever be enough?
Worthy of someone else's love?
All of my hang ups and all of my fears
You made them all disappear
One step ahead of me
You saw what we could be
How did you know, down in your bones,
That I'd come around?
One step ahead always
Guiding me through my haze
Was too scared to see what this could mean
But I see it now
I see it now
I see it now
Nobody else would forgive my mistakes
Nobody else would have stayed
One step ahead of me
You saw what we could be
How did you know, down in your bones,
That I'd come around?
One step ahead always
Guiding me through my haze
Was too scared to see what this could mean
But I see it now
I see it now
I see it now
I see it now
I see it now
