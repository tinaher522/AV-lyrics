<song artist="A_Great_Big_World" title="Where_Does_The_Time_Go?">
Where does the time go?
I don't want this to end
Where does the time go?
Let's hang on to the moment we're in
Of all the things we will remember
The good, the bad, and all the blessings in disguise
Today will stick with me forever
Even if we have to say goodbye
Where does the time go?
I keep losing track
Where does the time go?
We're too young to get lost looking back
Life doesn't always give us answers
Some dots, they won't connect until the years go by
If we're not meant to be together
Someday we'll know the reasons why
Of all the things we will remember
The good, the bad, and all the blessings in disguise
Today will stick with me forever
Even if we have to say goodbye
Where does the time go?
I don't want this to end
Where does the time go?
Let's hang on to the moment we're in
