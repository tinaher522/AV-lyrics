<song artist="A_Great_Big_World" title="When_The_Morning_Comes">
What happened before was a waste of time
I don't care anymore
I wanna move on, there is so much more 
Than who's right or who's wrong
We can shake it
Let the pieces fall
We can take it
I believe, I believe, I believe
When the lights go out,
And the bombs come down
I will hear your heart beating
When the morning comes
And the war is done
You will hear my heart beating
It happened so fast, the way it tore right through
Can't erase what has passed
But we're still alive in a world 
That wants to keep us alive
We can shake it
And let the pieces fall
Oh, we're gonna make it
I believe, I believe, I believe
When the lights go out,
And the bombs come down
I will hear your heart beating
When the morning comes
And the war is done
You will hear my heart beating
When the lights go out,
And the bombs come down
I will hear your heart beating
When the morning comes
And the war is done
You will hear my heart beating
You will hear my heart beating
I will hear your heart beating
