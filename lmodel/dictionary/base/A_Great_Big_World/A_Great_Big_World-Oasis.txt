<song artist="A_Great_Big_World" title="Oasis">
Don't cry,
You're mine
For forever
For forever
I need
You now,
More than ever
More than ever
Head full of lies
Sun in my eyes
You make it easy
Don't look away
These are the days
You gotta believe me!
When we're lost in a desert night
and we're chasing our paradise
When we can't fight another fight
We're gonna make it
You're my OASIS
You're my OASIS
You're my OASIS
You're my OASIS
This life
Is made
For each other
For each other
Crossed lines
Mistakes,
There's no other
There's no other
Head full of lies
Sun in my eyes
You make it easy
Nowhere to go
I'm already home
You gotta believe me!
When we're lost in a desert night
And we're chasing our paradise
When we can't fight another fight
We're gonna make it
You're my OASIS
You're my OASIS
You're my OASIS
You're my OASIS
As I roam through the wasteland
You're the one thing I need
I see you off in the distance
You're my OASIS
You're my OASIS
When we're lost in a desert night
And we're chasing our paradise
When we can't fight another fight
We're gonna make it, make it, make it make it
When we're lost in a desert night
And we're chasing our paradise
When we can't fight another fight
We're gonna make it, make it, make it, make it
You're my OASIS
You're my OASIS
You're my OASIS
You're my OASIS
