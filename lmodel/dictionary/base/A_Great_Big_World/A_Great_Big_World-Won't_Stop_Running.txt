<song artist="A_Great_Big_World" title="Won't_Stop_Running">
Facing forward, lights out
I won't stop running
Falling backwards, hands tied
I won't stop running
I'll take another sunrise
Another hand to hold tight
This isn't over
I am way too young and I won't stop running
I won't stop running
I am way too young and I won't stop running
I don't know how much longer I can fake it
That it's all alright, that I can do this alone
And I know that life is what you make it
But it's hard to see stars when you're always caught in the folds
Every night, in my mind it's a fight
But I won't stop dreaming
'Cause this isn't over
It's never over
Facing forward, lights out
I won't stop running
Falling backwards, hands tied
I won't stop running
I'll take another sunrise
Another hand to hold tight
This isn't over
I am way too young and I won't stop running
I won't stop running
I am way too young and I won't stop running
I'd rather be the one that starts the fire
Than to shut my mouth and be the one who gets burned
Yeah, it is what it is but I wanna go higher
'Cause I felt it once before, I believe the tables will turn
I wanna love and be the one who is loved
No, I won't stop dreaming
'Cause this isn't over
It's never over
Facing forward, lights out
I won't stop running
Falling backwards, hands tied
I won't stop running
I'll take another sunrise
Another hand to hold tight
This isn't over
I am way too young and I won't stop running
I won't stop running
I am way too young and I won't stop running
How do you explain it?
For seven years, I made it through the falls
I'm living it all, I'm living it all
I'm tearing off the labels
And suddenly I'm able, scaling walls
I'm living it all, I'm living it all and I won't stop running
I won't stop running
I am way too young and I won't stop running
Facing forward, lights out
I won't stop running
Falling backwards, hands tied
I won't stop running
I'll take another sunrise
Another hand to hold tight
This isn't over (This isn't over)
This isn't over (This isn't over)
This isn't over 
I am way too young and I won't stop running
