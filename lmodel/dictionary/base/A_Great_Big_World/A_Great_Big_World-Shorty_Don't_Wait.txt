<song artist="A_Great_Big_World" title="Shorty_Don't_Wait">
Shorty don't wait in line
Shorty don't wait til the sun don't shine
Shorty don't wait in line
Shorty don't wait til your life goes by
When your heart don't feel like dancing
I'll be there to give you mine
When you lose that happy feeling
I will lift your spirits high
Shorty don't wait in line
Shorty don't wait til the sun don't shine
Shorty don't wait in line
Shorty don't wait til your life goes by
All those people who have hurt you
They ain't worth your precious time
When there's no one you can turn to
I'll be right there by your side
Shorty don't wait in line
Shorty don't wait til the sun don't shine
Shorty don't wait in line
Shorty don't wait til your life goes by
Take that weight off of your shoulders
You can rest your head on mine
When you feel like starting over
Don't think twice, yea it's alright.
Shorty don't wait in line
Shorty don't wait til the sun don't shine
Shorty don't wait in line
Shorty don't wait til your life goes by
