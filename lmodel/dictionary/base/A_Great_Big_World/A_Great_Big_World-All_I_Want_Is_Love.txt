<song artist="A_Great_Big_World" title="All_I_Want_Is_Love">
Fear
You're just a name that I have learned
Another way for me to turn
And you brought me here
And it took years for me to find
That you were only in my mind
I've been looking in the wrong place
Couldn't see what I've always known
I was facing the wrong way
I missed it all, I missed it all
I don't care what they all say
Let me find my own way home
I don't care if my heart breaks
All I want is love
Hope
You're just a name that I hold close
There when I needed you the most
And you brought me here
Where I can learn to love myself
Without the love of someone else
I've been looking in the wrong place
Couldn't see what I've always known
I was facing the wrong way
I missed it all, I missed it all
I don't care what they all say
Let me find my own way home
I don't care if my heart breaks
All I want is love
All I want is love
All I want is love
I don't care what they all say
I don't care if my heart breaks
I don't care what they all say (all I want is love)
I don't care if my heart breaks
I don't care if my heart breaks
I've been looking in the wrong place
Couldn't see what I've always known
I was facing the wrong way
I missed it all, I missed it all
I don't care what they all say
Let me find my own way home
I don't care if my heart breaks
All I want is love
I don't care what they all say (all I want is love)
I don't care if my heart breaks (all I want is love)
I don't care what they all say (all I want is love)
I don't care if my heart breaks
All I want is love
