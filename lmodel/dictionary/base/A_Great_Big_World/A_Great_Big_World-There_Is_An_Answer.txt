<song artist="A_Great_Big_World" title="There_Is_An_Answer">
I am just a sailor in a great big sea
Searching for what's meant for me
And I thank my lucky stars every single day
I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be
When the storm begins to blow
When I've lost my way back home
Oh, there is an answer
Oh, there is an answer
There is a ripple to every wave
A rhythm to the days and nights
And all our thoughts, they make the world go round
All our efforts multiply
Make a change, and you will see
One small step is all we need
Oh, there is an answer
Oh, there is an answer
There is no difference between you and me
It lies beyond our history
And if we only take the time to see we're all we need
Just take my hand, and see me as a brother
Look inside, and you will find
Love exists in every kind
Oh, there is an answer
Oh, there is an answer
Near or far, oh I believe that love will find us there
Through the dark, oh I believe that love will find us there
Oh, I believe that love will find us there
Oh, I believe that love will find us there
Oh, I believe that love will find us there
Oh, there is an answer
