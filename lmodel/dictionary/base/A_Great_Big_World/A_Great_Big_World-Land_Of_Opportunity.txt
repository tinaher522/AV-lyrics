<song artist="A_Great_Big_World" title="Land_Of_Opportunity">
I'm sailing away, to a Land of Opportunity.
The sun will shine, and birds will sing there everyday
I'm sailing away, and I hope that you remember me.
It was fun, we had our run. Hip hip hooray!
You said 'hello', I loved you so,
just like in a movie scene.
I want you to know, I had to let go, 
I'm falling in love again.
I'm running away, to a place where you won't bother me.
We won't talk for a while, we'll be okay.
And I'm changing my name to a word that's really hard to say.
It's no one's fault, I'm just too young, and you're insane.
I wasted my time, I missed all the signs, 
and it ruined my holiday.
I want you to know, I had to let go,
I'm falling in love again
I just gotta believe there's something better.
I just gotta believe there's something more than you and me.
I've just gotta believe, I've just gotta believe.
You said 'hello', I loved you so,
I felt like a kid again.
I want you to know, I had to let go
I'm falling in love again.
I just gotta believe there's something better.
I just gotta believe there's something more than you and me.
I've just gotta believe, I've just gotta believe.
I'm sailing away to a Land of Opportunity.
