<song artist="Demi_Lovato" title="How_To_Love">
See you had a lot of crooks try to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't ever figure out
How to love
How to love
See I had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now I'm in this corner trying to put it together
How to love
How to love
For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare the way you moving your body
Like you never had my love
Had my love
When I was just a young and my looks were so precious
But now I'm grown up so fly it's like a blessing
But I can't have a man look at me for five seconds
Without me being insecure
I never credit myself so when I got older
It's seems like I came back ten times over
Now I'm sitting here in this damn corner
Looking through all my thoughts
And looking over my shoulder
See I had a lot of crooks try to steal my heart
Never really had luck, couldn't ever figure out
How to love
How to love
See I had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now I'm in this corner trying to put it together
How to love
How to love
I had a lot of dreams that transformed to visions
The fact that I saw the world affected all my decisions
But it
(Wasn't your fault, wasn't in your intentions
To be the one here talking to me be)
The one listening
But I admire your popping bottles and dippin'
Just as much as you admire bartending and stripping
Baby, so don't be mad, nobody else tripping
You see a lot of crooks but the crooks still crook
See I had a lot of crooks try to steal my heart
Never really had luck, couldn't ever figure out
How to love
How to love
Oh, see I just want you to know
That I deserve the best
I'm beautiful, I'm beautiful, yeah
See I want you to know I'm far from the usual
Far from the usual
You see I had a lot of crooks try to steal my heart
Never really had luck, couldn't ever figure out
How to love
How to love
I had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now I'm in this corner trying to put it together
How to love
How to love
