<song artist="Demi_Lovato" title="U_Got_Nothin'_On_Me">
(You got nothin' on me!)
(You got nothin' on me!)
(You got nothin' on me!)
(You got nothin' on me!)
Summer came it took me by surprise
A California sunshine in my eyes
Driving with the top down
We sing along to our favorite songs
Nothing could go wrong
Laughing as we gazed under the moon
You kissed me and it never felt too soon
Hard to believe that anything
Could tear us apart 
Then you break my heart
Now I know who you are
You got nothin' on me
I see I should have known it from the start
(You got nothin' on me)
You can't tell me lies, don't even try
Cause this is goodbye
Goodbye
Caught you from the corner of my eye
You smiled at a girl while passing by
Thought you had me fooled but you were wrong
I know what's going on
It didn't take me long
Wasn't hard to read between the lines
The necklace in your car that wasn't mine
Nothing I would give, do, or say
Now I'm on my way
Now it's too late
Now I know who you are
You got nothin' on me
I see I should of known it from the start
(You got nothin' on me)
You can't tell me lies, don't even try
Cause this is goodbye
To broken promises
Time to face your carelessness
Don't fool me with apologies
And by crawling on your knees
You got nothin' on me
(You got nothin on me)
You got nothin' on me
I know who you are
Now I see I should have known it from the start
You can't tell me lies, don't even try
Cause this is goodbye
Now I know who you are
You got nothin' on me
I see, I should have known it from the start
(You got nothin' on me)
You can't tell me lies, don't even try
Cause this is goodbye 
Goodbye
