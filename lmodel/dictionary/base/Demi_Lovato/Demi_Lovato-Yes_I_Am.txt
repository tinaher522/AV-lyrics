<song artist="Demi_Lovato" title="Yes_I_Am">
Sexy lady knows what she wants out of life
See she got her own means
Doing whatever she likes
Feels good to have you
She don't need you
She can't depend on a man
After all that she's been through
She ain't running behind you
Trust me I know 'cause I am her
I've got (I've got)
What I need (what I need)
Right here (right here)
It's in me (to me)
I am (I am)
Everything (everything)
All that I need and I won't repeat it
I won't stop now
Got it all (got it all) figured out (figured out)
I've got (I've got)
What I need (what I need)
Right here (right here)
Everything
I am
Yes I am yes I am (I am)
Yes I am yes I am
So you can't deny that
She had the strength to survive
Through the good and the bad
She's having the time of her live
Feels so good to have you
She don't need you
She can't depend on a man
After all that she's been through
She ain't running behind you
Trust me I know 'cause I am her
I've got (I've got)
What I need (what I need)
Right here (right here)
It's in me (to me)
I am (I am)
Everything (everything)
All that I need and I won't repeat it
I won't stop now (stop now)
I've got (I've got)
What I need (what I need)
Right here (right here)
Everything
I am
Yes I am yes I am (I am)
Yes I am yes I am 
You are
If you are throw your hands up
(So put your hands up)
If you are let me see your hands up
I've got (I've got)
What I need (what I need)
Right here (right here)
Itâ€™s in me (to me)
I am (I am)
Everything (everything)
All that I need and I won't repeat it
I won't stop now (stop now)
I've got (I've got)
What I need (what I need)
Right here (right here)
Everything
I am
Yes I am yes I am (I am)
Yes I am yes I am
If you are throw your hands up
If you are let me see your hands up
