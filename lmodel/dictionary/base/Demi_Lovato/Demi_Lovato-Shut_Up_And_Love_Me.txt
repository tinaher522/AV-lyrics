<song artist="Demi_Lovato" title="Shut_Up_And_Love_Me">
We were fine this morning
Now I feel like I'm dreaming
You try to tell me what's happened
But I can't hear when you're screamin'
No more "I'm sorry"s
I don't have the time
You break up to make up
So spare me the lie
Shut up and love me
'Cause you've already got me
I don't need words
I need time in your arms
I need love from you, baby
You knew it's not right
We could've been smilin'
You should've seen the light
Inside my eyes
And I shouldn't have been crying
Oh, no
Don't say you need me
Don't promise to change
I know that you need me
There's nothing to say
Shut up and love me
'Cause you've already got me
I don't need words
I need time in your arms
I need love from you, baby
Shut up and love me
'Cause you've already got me
'Cause I don't need words
And as much as it hurts
I need love from you, baby
And how can you be
Too blind to see
The girl who stands before you
Who wants you more than anything
Just shut up and love me
'Cause you've already got me
I don't need words
I need time in your arms
I need love from you, baby
Ooh
Oh just shut up and love me
I don't need words
And as much as it hurts
I need love from you, baby
