<song artist="Demi_Lovato" title="Open">
Spitting fire back &amp; forth now
Times have changed in just a few months
Neighbors complaining from the fights &amp; why can't things be the same
And maybe I'm just a little bit cautious
Of what I'm gonna say
When I tell you I can't live this way
I don't know what to expect from someone who's so insane
Why can't I get through the night
Without another fight
I'm tired of the hurting
Is it really worth it?
Am I all alone again?
Cause I'm kinda feeling like I'm screaming with my mouth shut
When it's really open
The only noises in my head 
Are consumed of your voice
From all the pain &amp; hatred
How long can you kick somebody down
Before a foot breaks?
Why can't I get through the night
Without another fight
I'm tired of the hurting
Is it really worth it?
Am I all alone again?
Cause I'm kinda feeling like I'm screaming with my mouth shut
When it's really open
And I knew that you would fabricate
This situation just for
The sake of your need for attention
I'm sick of always being the one
To always break down,always melt down
In the end
And maybe this time
It's a sign that independence &amp; I
Are finally catching on
I don't need you to rely on
Why can't I get through the night
Without another fight
I'm tired of the hurting
Is it really worth it?
Am I all alone again?
Cause I'm kinda feeling like I'm screaming with my mouth shut
When it's really open
Spitting fire back &amp; forth now
Times have changed in just a few months
