<song artist="Demi_Lovato" title="Back_Around">
What did I do to deserve this? 
Tell me the truth and don't lie 
You're pretty good at that but, no not this time 
You walk around like you run the world 
Running your mouth, and talking about me now, 
They think that you're the perfect girl, 
They're gonna see everything so get back 
It's gonna come back around 
You know that this town is just too small and i'm too strong to take this again 
You just too adverse but I have got news 
You know you're just gonna lose 
Everything and everyone that means so much to you. 

I'm feeling bad for, 
You are alone and nobody cares that you are 
One look into your eyes, 
Easy to see what you could be but you're not 
I say it's time that you give in, 
Since it was real, you cannot fulfill, you're over 
You feel your heart beat deep down 
Ignoring the shame of causing this pain, 
Just get out 
It's gonna come back around 
You know that this town is just too small and i'm too strong to take this again 
You just too adverse but I got news 
You know you're just gonna lose 
Everything and everyone that means so much to you. 
You keep hearing everything that people say 
And you cant take the pain another day 

It's coming back around 
I told you this town was just too small 
You're just too adverse but you can stop now 
Cuz it's gonna come back around 
And around and around and around and around 
Yeah yeah 

It's gonna come back around 
You know that this town is just too small and i'm too strong (Too strong) 
To take this, take this again [Whoa] 
You're just too adverse but Ive got news 
You know you're just gonna lose 
Everything and everyone that means so much to you 
Everything and everyone that means so much to you 
Everything and everyone that means so much to you.
