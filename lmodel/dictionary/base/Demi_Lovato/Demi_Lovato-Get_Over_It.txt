<song artist="Demi_Lovato" title="Get_Over_It">
(talking) I can't believe you did this but uh- 
(singing)
You told me you would call! You said just wait- just wait, for you to call! But now I'm standing here, with all my girls. You better listen, listen well 'cause when I say this, you can't ignore! It's done....
(chorus) Now that your gone, I'm feeling pretty awe-some. When you were here-i was lame, to fall for your little game! You know what, it's pretty insane, how you're making me insane! INSANE FOR DATING YOU! Insane for, well you know GET OVER IT! 
Listen dear, when you told me you loved me, my heart mealted! When you ignored me, my heart broke! When we broke up, my hearts on fire! yeah get over it, 'cause right now it's so insane 'cause my HEART'S ON FIRE, my heart's on fire! 
Demi: you told me you would call!
Joe: Just wait, wait for me to call!
Demi: now I'm with my friends, you better listen up when I say "get over it, we're done!" 
Demi and joe:
Chorus) Now that your gone, I'm feeling pretty awe-some. When you were here-i was lame, to fall for your little game! You know what, it's pretty insane, how you're making me insane! INSANE FOR DATING YOU! Insane for, well you know GET OVER IT!
