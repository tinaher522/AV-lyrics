<song artist="Demi_Lovato" title="Mirror">
Never be
(Never, never)
Ain't it plain to see
Tell me honestly
Don't my eyes
Speak up for me
(Never, never)
You're always true to me
How can I make it real
Why can't you see
The way I feel
Ain't it plain to see
Tell me honestly
Don't my eyes
Speak up for me
(Never, never)
You're always true to me
How can I make it real
Why can't you see
The way I feel
