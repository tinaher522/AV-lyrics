<song artist="Demi_Lovato" title="1,_2,_3,_4_Goodbye">
Take care
Of yourself darling
I guess
I guess this is goodbye
Tomorrow's coming quicker
Than yesterday came today
I guess this is goodnight
Cause' we've all
Got one last night together
So let's start the party
You know we rocked
Promise you
Won't forget about me
So these moments spent
Are coming to an end
I'm counting seconds
Till' next time again
Listen
One, two, three
Four, five
Six, seven
Eight, nine
We couldn't change it
If we tried
One, two, three, four
Goodbye
We all said before
Our time is here
But it never
Meant a thing
Until we all
Began to tear
And I'll be
Aching before
And after we depart
From rememberences
From the very start
The grand memories
Together
the grand memories
Together
Now here I am
It's your song
I'll be singing
Your the voice
I heard
Inside my head
These moments spent
Are coming to an end
I'm counting seconds
Until next time again
Listen
One, two, three
Four, five
Six, seven
Eight, nine
We couldn't change it
If we tried
One, two, three, four
Goodbye
We've raised our voices
We've followed our dreams
One thing who will I be you ask
Well we'll never be too cool
For Camp Rock Three
These moments spent
Are coming to an end
I'm counting seconds
Until next time again
Listen
One, two, three
Four, five
Six, seven
Eight, nine
We couldn't change it
If we tried
One, two, three
Goodbye
