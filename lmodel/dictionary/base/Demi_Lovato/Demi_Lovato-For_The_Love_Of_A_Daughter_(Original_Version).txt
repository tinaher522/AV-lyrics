<song artist="Demi_Lovato" title="For_The_Love_Of_A_Daughter_(Original_Version)">
It's been two years since we've spoken last
You can't take back what we never had
Selfish hands always expecting more
Am I your child or just a charity ward?
You have a hollowed out heart
But it's heavy in your chest
I try so hard to fight it but it's hopeless
Hopeless, you're hopeless
Oh father, dear father
I'd love to leave you alone but I can't bear to let you go
Oh father, dear father
Put the bottle down for the love of a daughter
Oh father
Four years old with my back to the door 
And all I could hear was the back and forth
I can be manipulated only so many times
Before even "I love you" starts to sound like a lie
You have a hollowed out heart
But it's heavy in your chest
I try so hard to fight it but it's hopeless
Hopeless, you're hopeless
Oh father, dear father
I'd love to leave you alone but I can't bear to let you go
Oh father, dear father
Put the bottle down for the love of a daughter
Oh father
How could you lie to your flesh and your blood?
How could you go where no gentlemen would?
How could you do what you've done
To a wife and a child that you swore you loved?
How could you lie to your flesh and your blood?
How could you go where no gentlemen would?
How could you do what you've done
To a wife and a child that you swore you loved?

Oh father, please father
I'd love to leave you alone but I can't bear to let you go
Oh father, dear father
Put the bottle down for the love of a daughter
Oh father, please father
I'd love to leave you alone but I can't bear to let you go
Oh father, dear father
Put the bottle down for the love of a daughter
Oh father
