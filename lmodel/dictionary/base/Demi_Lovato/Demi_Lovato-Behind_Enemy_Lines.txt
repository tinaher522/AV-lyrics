<song artist="Demi_Lovato" title="Behind_Enemy_Lines">
And I feel, I feel a deep connection, 
And I think, that we might be onto something, no 
And I know it's something special, 
Seeing you here, is not coincidental, mhh 
Well, I've been walkin' (walkin') behind enemy lines, 
And I've been fighting, fighting, from the other side, 
I've been saying (saying) "I won't fall this time", 
And now I'm walkin' (walkin') within enemy lines. 
Ohh, ohh 
See, I was trying to be everything you weren't expecting, 
All I ever wanted was to try and keep you guessing, 
Now I'm falling way too fast, 
I just want this love to last, forever (forever) 
Everytime I feel this way 
Oh, something's changed for the better 
And I've been walkin' (walkin') behind enemy lines, 
And I've been fightin, fighting, from the other side, 
And I've been saying (saying) "I won't fall this time", 
And now I'm walkin' (walkin') within enemy lines 
Now I'm walkin' (walkin') behind enemy lines, 
And now I'm fightin' (fighting) from the other side, 
And I've been saying (saying) "I won't fall this time", 
And now I'm walkin' (walkin') within enemy lines
