<song artist="Demi_Lovato" title="Shadow">
I glanced upon the ground today,I noticed something 
It followed me along the way
A figure of gray
Impersonating every move I make
For now we'll call it my shadow
And it said will you replace it
So you'll be with me everywhere I go
Sentences of yours
Running throughout my head
Searching for a chance
To catch my breath
A never ending dream
You'll become a part of me
Day or night 
Dark or light you'll be
Taking over that thing called my shadow
And what happens on the days when
The clouds appear &amp; fade away my shade,oh
That's are cue babe
We'll run away to a place where the sun always shines
That not even time could erase
You're my weakness babe but you give me strength
I need you,I need you like the blood in my veins
Sentences of yours
Running throughout my head
Searching for a chance
To catch my breath
A never ending dream
You'll become a part of me
Day or night 
Dark or light you'll be
Taking over that thing called my shadow
