<song artist="Demi_Lovato" title="So_Far_So_Great">
Off to the races
I'm going places
Might be a long shot
Not gonna waste it
This is the big break
And It's calling my name
Yeah
So far so great, Get with it
At least that's how i see it
Having a dream's just the beginning
So far so great, Believe it
Cant take away this feeling
Taking a ride, chance to my side
Yeah I can't wait, So far so great
Might need to wing it, Still gonna bring it
Not gonna sink low, I'm going swimming
Swing for the fences, Sky's not the limit today
Yeah
So far so great, Get with it
At least that's how i see it
Having a dream's just the beginning
So far so great, Believe it
Cant take away this feeling
Taking a ride, chance to my side
Yeah I can't wait, So far so great
Everyone says don't get your hopes up
Learn the ropes and climb the ladder
I know in the end, just being here is the best
And it only gets better, It only gets better
So far so great, Get with it
At least that's how i see it
Having a dream's just the beginning
So far so great, Believe it
Cant take away this feeling
Taking a ride, chance to my side
Yeah I can't wait, So far so great
I can't wait, So far so great
