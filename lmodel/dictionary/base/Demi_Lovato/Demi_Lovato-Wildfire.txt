<song artist="Demi_Lovato" title="Wildfire">
We were goin way too fast
Chasin down the hourglass
Runnin from a past
Headed out with no direction (no direction)
Kerosene beauty queen
Lookin for her matchstick king
To burn into my heart
Hand in to the flame
We could set the world ablaze 
Cuz Baby, you're all I need
Come now, set me free
Like a wildfire
Like a wildfire
Breathless, I can't resist
Melt with your scarlet kiss
Like a wildfire
Like a wildfire
I look into your sunset eyes
Waitin for the moon to rise
So I can feel your heat
This love is so completely crazy (completely crazy)
You been fucking with my dreams
Rip me like your torn up jeans
I don't even care
You can take me there
You can set me my world ablaze 
Cuz Baby, you're all I need
Come now, set me free
Like a wildfire
Like a wildfire
Breathless, I can't resist
Melt with your scarlet kiss
Like a wildfire
Like a wildfire
Baby tell me where you wanna run, run
Cuz I been burning like the mornin sun
Take my hand, you can burn this city with me
Play me like your first guitar
Where every single notes too hard (too hard)
I don't even care
You can take me there
We can set the world on fire
Cuz Baby, you're all I need
Come now, set me free
Like a wildfire
Like a wildfire
Breathless, I can't resist
Melt in your scarlet kiss
Like a wildfire
Like a wildfire
