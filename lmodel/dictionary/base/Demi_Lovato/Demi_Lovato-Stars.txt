<song artist="Demi_Lovato" title="Stars">
Walking in we causing a frenzy
Walking in we causing a
Knock 'em all out
Beat 'em like Rousey
We don't give a
We don't, we don't give a
Rolling so deep, but we ain't thirsty
Rolling so deep, but we ain't
Talking trash, we keeping it classy
We don't give a
We don't, we don't give a
Oh when the lights go out 
And it all goes down
No one even knows when tomorrow comes cuz
We live for now
You and I
And we really don't need the light
Cuz we're stars tonight
Oh, yeah we really don't need the light
Cuz we're stars tonight
Oh, and we don't really need the light
Cuz we're stars tonight
Oh, yeah we don't really need the light
Cuz we're stars
Working all week got me all crazy
Working all week got me all
Dancing dirty, get a little Swayze
We don't give a
We don't, we don't give a
Get 'em hyped up
Get 'em all talking
Get 'em hyped up
Get 'em all...
Looking at you, feeling so fancy
We don't give a
We don't, we don't give a
Oh when the lights go out 
And it all goes down
No one even knows when tomorrow comes cuz
We live for now
You and I
And we really don't need the light
Cuz we're stars tonight
Oh, yeah we really don't need the light
Cuz we're stars tonight
Oh, and we don't really need the light
Cuz we're stars tonight
Oh, yeah we don't really need the light
Cuz we're stars
We're the only ones
Who can fight the sun
We're forever young
And we just begun
We're the only ones
Who can fight the sun
We're forever young
And we live for now
You and I
And we really don't need the light
Cuz we're stars tonight
Oh, yeah we really don't need the light
Cuz we're stars tonight
Oh, and we don't really need the light
Cuz we're stars tonight
Oh, yeah we don't really need the light
Cuz we're stars
