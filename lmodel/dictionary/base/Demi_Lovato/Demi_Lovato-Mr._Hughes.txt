<song artist="Demi_Lovato" title="Mr._Hughes">
I remembered you walked out the door
So I stayed awake for days
No pill or drink could get me off the floor
Nothing seemed to ease the pain
Listen to me honey
I've got something new to say
I forgive but can't forget your mistakes
Now I think it's time for you to pay
Oh it's Mr. Hughes
And he's got the blues
Cause his high school dreams they never went too far
Yeah it's Mr. Hughes
And he's got the blues
Cause he missed his chance to be with a star
Oh oh oh oh ohh...
Mr. Hughes I ain't missing you
This is for the times you broke my heart
And all the years you led me on
Now you're asking for a brand new start
But you're way too late and now I'm gone
Listen to me honey
I've got something new to say
I forgive but can't forget your mistakes
Now I think it's time for you to pay
Oh it's Mr. Hughes
And he's got the blues
Cause his high school dreams they never went too far
Yeah it's Mr. Hughes
And he's got the blues
Cause he missed his chance to be with a star
Oh oh oh oh ohh...
Mr. Hughes I ain't missing you
Oh oh oh oh ohh...
Mr. Hughes I ain't missing you
How could you think I'm so stupid
I wouldn't see through
I always do
Now I got a new man and he's ten times the man 
You could ever be Mr. Hughes!
Oh it's Mr. Hughes
And he's got the blues (he's got the blues)
Cause his high school dreams they never went too far (never went too far)
Yeah it's Mr. Hughes
And he's got the blues (blues)
Cause he missed his chance to be with a star
Oh oh oh oh ohh...
Mr. Hughes I ain't missing you
Oh oh oh oh ohh...
Mr. Hughes I ain't missing you
Oh oh oh oh ohh...
Mr. Hughes I ain't missing you
