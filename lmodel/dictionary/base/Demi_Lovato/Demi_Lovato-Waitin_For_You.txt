<song artist="Demi_Lovato" title="Waitin_For_You">
You said that you'd never hurt me
Be the band aid when I bleed
But I guess that that band aid was all made of paper
Cause you never stuck to me
And you say that you conquered the lion
Without even tryin
But she only gets stronger
She only bites harder 
And I'll only die fighting
You can run, you can run but you know that I know just what you've done (done)
You can run, you can run but save those words for one on one (one on one, one on one)
So when the lights go down and the sun hits ground
You should know that I won't back down (I'll be waitin for ya)
Knuckles out and the guard in my mouth
When you're hungry for the next round (I'll be waitin for ya)
I will
I'll be waitin for ya
I will
I'll be waitin for ya
I will
Ya I don't take things too personal
But you made shit personal
Talkin bout my bad habits
Man fuck my bad habits
Don't act like you got none
You can run, you can run but you know that I know just what you've done (done)
You can run, you can run but save those words for one on one (one on one, one on one)
So when the lights go down and the sun hits ground
You should know that I won't back down (I'll be waitin for ya)
Knuckles out and the guard in my mouth
When you're hungry for the next round (I'll be waitin for ya)
I will
I'll be waitin for ya
I will
I'll be waitin for ya
I will
Sirah
You got my name in your mouth
Forgive me when I knock it
I love it when you talk about me
Just cause you don't know yourself
My jabs go go for broke
Your teeth is on the floor
Thirty million people watchin
Do you still want more
Fake bitches gon get it
I am winnin
But you isn't
Call your dentist 
Cause I meant this
I don't see no competition
Goin wild
Mikey Tyson
Born a fighter
I will triumph
Bitch I thought you knew I was coming for your title
So when the lights go down and the sun hits ground
You should know that I won't back down (I'll be waitin for ya)
Knuckles out and the guard in my mouth
When you're hungry for the next round (I'll be waitin for ya)
I will
No
I'll be waitin for ya
I will
I'll be waitin
I'll be waitin for ya
I will
I'll be waitin for ya
