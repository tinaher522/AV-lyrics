<song artist="Demi_Lovato" title="Everyone_Knows">
Everyone says they know who i am
Everyone thinks they have me all figured out
But they only see me when im not afraid
They only see who i wanna be
We all run and hide every once and a while
We all let go and run never letting it show
Everyone says they know who i am
Everyone thinks they have me all figured out
But they only see me when im not afraid
They only see who i wanna be
They think they found their homecoming queen
But baby
Ohh 
But baby im just me
We all run and hide every once and a while
And we all let go and run never letting it show
So look at me right now
Take a good look
Cus im not scared to frown
No oh
This is who i am
Ill never change a thing not for you
Im just me .
