<song artist="Demi_Lovato" title="Kiss_This">
I saw you on the front page of the letter
She had to run away but you just wouldn't let her
So what is she supposed to do
She cant do anything when shes with you
Try to find her heart but its so lost
Now its time to show you who's boss
123 she doesn't wanna be
Held down so she cant see
All of the coolest things
She can be'
Nobody knows but me
Take a chance a see
She gonna make wish
So kiss this
When she finds the one
Her heart starts to jump
She thinks he's never gone
He's says hell never run
Away with her heart
Its no longer lost
Its time to show you who's boss
123 she doesn't wanna be
Held down so she cant see
All of the coolest things
She can be
Nobody knows but me
Take a chance a see
She gonna make wish
So kiss this
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh ohhhhh
Gotta get back to her heart
Tell her where to go when she starts
To cry and ask
The world why
Well baby... here it comes
123 she doesn't wanna be
Held down so she cant see
All of the coolest things
She can be
Nobody knows but me
Take a chance a see
She gonna make wish
So kiss this
2x
C'mon c'mon and kiss this you cant c'mon and kiss this
OHHHÂ :)
