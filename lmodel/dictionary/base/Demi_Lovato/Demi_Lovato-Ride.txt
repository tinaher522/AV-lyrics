<song artist="Demi_Lovato" title="Ride">
I'm gonna rock this place like outta space
Give you something that you never had
I'm gonna paint my nails
And style my hair
And save me a strawberry bubble bath
I'm gonna sweep my mind
And the time ill find
That i got summet to say
I'm gonna jump around
And paint this town
Let me hear you say
HEY
Take me, take me down, take me down
Ride
Now follow, follow me now, follow me now
Ride
Turn it up
