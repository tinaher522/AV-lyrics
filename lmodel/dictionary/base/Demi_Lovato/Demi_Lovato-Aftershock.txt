<song artist="Demi_Lovato" title="Aftershock">
Beat's so heavy
Make my head get hazy
Big boobs make the ground shake crazy
Body so hot
Feel like they taze me
Keel the lights
Watch the lights get crowd gets shady
Girls getting tricky
Move round like elastic
Boys turned on
You can see all the static
Charge it up
make it automatic
Stop the press
Hear the kick go manic
I feel you move closer to me
All the signals peaking
Crack up my electricity
'Till I overload
Lovestruck
My heart is overheating and it won't stop
I try to slow the beating but you're so hot
The tremors keep repeating
And I tell myself keep breathing 
But I'm caught in your aftershock
Hit me like an earthquake
feel my heaven and earth shake
Lovestruck
The tremors keep repeating
And I tell myself keep breathing 
But I'm caught in your aftershock
Bass so thick
You can see the sound wave
Bubbly spilling like it's your birthday
And comes blasting
Now make the ground sway
Put your hands up shout on the replay
I feel you move closer to me
All the signals peaking
Crack up my electricity
'Till I overload
Lovestruck
My heart is overheating and it won't stop
I try to slow the beating but you're so hot
The tremors keep repeating
And I tell myself keep breathing 
But I'm caught in your aftershock
Hit me like an earthquake
feel my heaven and earth shake
Lovestruck
The tremors keep repeating
And I tell myself keep breathing 
But I'm caught in your aftershock
In your aftershock
Your lips conduct electric flow
Your kiss vibrates me head to toe
Your touch is glowing in the dark
Those neon eyes send me ablaze
Woah
Lovestruck
My heart is overheating and it won't stop
I try to slow the beating but you're so hot
The tremors keep repeating
And I tell myself keep breathing 
But I'm caught in your aftershock
Hit me like an earthquake
feel my heaven and earth shake
Lovestruck
The tremors keep repeating
And I tell myself keep breathing 
But I'm caught in your aftershock
Yeah
(Aftershock)
(Aftershock)
Whoah 
In your aftershock
(Aftershock)
Whoah
