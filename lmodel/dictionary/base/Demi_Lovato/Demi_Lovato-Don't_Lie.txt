<song artist="Demi_Lovato" title="Don't_Lie">
It's been a month since you left
And the empty spaces you wanted me to feel
Only help me not to regret
'Cause I fill them with the heart you had steal
And after all you try to apologize
Waiting on the street
With some lame excuse you memorize
Trying to convince it's real
How do I know you're telling me the truth
(Don't try to lie)
How can I believe
You lied so many times to me
I know you won't make it through
Don't even try
Honey, there's no need to try
Stop with what you're selling
'Cause I won't buy
For once, listen what I'm telling
And again I watch you walk away
And feel nothing inside
No need to ask you to stay
?Cause, baby, I'm not blind
How do I know you're telling me the truth
(Don't try to lie)
How can I believe
You lied so many times to me
I know you won't make it through
Don't even try
A few days later
I'm thinking of you
When I see you with her
Bye bye boy, I really loved you
Now I know you weren't telling the truth
I knew I couldn't believe
Once again you lied to me
I promise I'll make it through
