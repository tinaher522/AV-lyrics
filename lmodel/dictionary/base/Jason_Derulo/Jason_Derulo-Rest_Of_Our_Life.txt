Life
Crazy nights we share, bottles everywhere
Drunk but we don't care, don't care
Jeans are on the floor, tipsy on the floor
I still want you more, you more
Put your phone away, making love today
Baby
If I ask you to stay right here with me
And never leave this bed
Yeah, pull the sheets right over it
Kiss your body, don't make plans
Baby, we can take our time
We gonna have tonight for the rest of our life
The rest of our life
Tonight I'm your tattoo, never leaving you
Never leave this room, this room
Don't you touch your hair
No makeup, I swear you're perfect everywhere
Put your phone away, making love today
Baby
If I ask you to stay right here with me
And never leave this bed
Yeah, pull the sheets right over it
Kiss your body, don't make plans
Baby, we can take our time
We gonna have tonight for the rest of our life
The rest of our life
You can stay the night
Right here with me
I want your love
I need your love
If I ask you to stay right here with me
And never leave this bed
Yeah
If I ask you to stay right here with me
And never leave this bed
Yeah, pull the sheets right over it
Kiss your body, don't make plans
Baby, we can take our time
We gonna have tonight for the rest of our life
You can stay the night
Right here with me
I want your love
I need your love
For the rest of my life
You can stay the night
Right here with me
I want your love
I need your love
For the rest of my life
Life
