<song artist="Jason_Derulo" title="Fire">
It’s Mr. 305
I just want to talk to all the women out there
And You see them, and they be on fire!
I’m talking about just burning the dance floor
Dale ga Lalia
Look at her burning the floor 
She’s leaving with me, you already know
Every time I bust a rhyme
I got these mamas like, gimmie some more,
Gimmie some more!
So I give them what they ask for
I rap my cashflow
Yes, so
She’s fire!
Ven pa’ ca que yo rompo papaya ay, ay, ay
Mami, get my feelings hurt
With all that ass and that pencil skirt
And nine times of ten
You gone catch me with 9 or a 10
Drinks up, yeah
Hands up, oh
Drinks up, yeah
Hands up, oh
Forget your plans
Cause tonight you’re mine,
And baby, you fire!
I’m on a roll
You look like something I can take tonight
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I’ll be your dose
While you’re girls in the bathroom blurring lines
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Ooh oohhh oohhh 
You’re burning up don't need a lighter
Buckle up it's an all nighter
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Hey Mary Jane, you know I loved you
Take you down, turn up!
[Chorus]
You on fire
The way you move it turns me on, yeah
I'd go nighter
You got the right to do me wrong, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, oh oh!
Drinks up, yeah!
Hands up, oh
Drinks up, yeah!
Hands up, oh

Cause soon enough your gone be sweating me!
