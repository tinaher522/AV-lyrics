<song artist="Jason_Derulo" title="Dumb">
You could've written me a letter,
You could've sang me a sad song,
I thought that things were getting better,
But no, baby I was so wrong
Love without her could be so better,
Thats all to say when the love's gone,
I tried to force it but there's no moving on
They say forgive and forget just to easy my mind,
And living with regret is just a waste of time,
But this misery is all that I've got
I'm so dumb, I'm so dumb
For thinkin' you could love me
Your so numb, your so numb
You can't feel it so it's easy
My love's still here
But your not there
You broke my heart, you don't care
I'm so dumb, I'm so dumb
For thinking you could love me
Where was the whistle or the buzzer
To let me know that it's over
Now I can't seem to get through the night
If her mind is over
What happened to the love
When did I stop being enough
Cuz damn I've been wherever we having
No where to dream that sickness from your love
Or drug woaaaaah!
They say forgive and forget just to easy my mind
And living with regret is just a waste of time
But this misery is all that I've got
I'm so dumb, I'm so dumb
For thinkin' you could love me
Your so numb, your so numb
You can't feel it so it's easy
My love's still here
But your not there
You broke my heart, you don't care
I'm so dumb, I'm so dumb
For thinking you could love me
I had my choice to watch
As you ripped out and stole my heart
Over and over again
You made a fool of me!
I'm so dumb, I'm so dumb
For thinkin' you could love me
Your so numb, your so numb
You can't feel it so it's easy
My love's still here
But your not there
You broke my heart, you don't care
I'm so dumb, I'm so dumb
For thinking you could love me
