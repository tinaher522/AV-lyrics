<song artist="Jason_Derulo" title="Fairytale">
Get a load of this
She said I turned to a prince, after just one kiss
Is this a joke i missed?
While she was with somebody else, 
This was all a trick? Yeah.
Grew up and realized that happiness is a lie.
Just wish that I could rewind, and face reality yeah
Once upon a time, I had a reason
To wake up everyday and continue breathin'
'Till she threw our love away, 'cause I discovered one enchantin' evenin'
This stupid beauty all along was cheatin'
That's when I knew that love was fake, (oh)
I don't believe in happy endings! 
I don't believe in fairy tales!
I don't believe I should go on pretending I don't believe in fairy tales!
