<song artist="Jason_Derulo" title="Wings">
Woke up this morning
Satisfied this morning 
You were laying by my side 
Yeah
The cold air brings you closer
With your head on my shoulder
Heaven sent you through the night
I, I know that heaven can wait 
I won't send you back today
Please tell me you'll stay
Stay cuz
If you leave today
The air I breathe you'll take
Baby let's get away ay ay ay
She opened up my eyes to show me she can fly
She kissed my lips and said I've never been so high(buh da da)
She's got wings(buh da da)
She's got wings(buh da da)
She's got buh da da da da da
She woke up she was smiling 
Contagious I was smiling
From the taste of our first kiss of the day
I'm loving our time together
But how can I make it better
Trying to figure out the words to say
I know that heaven can wait
I won't send you back today 
Please tell me you'll stay
Stay cuz
If you leave today
The air I breathe you'll take 
Baby let's get away 
She opened up my eyes to show me she can fly 
She kissed my lips and said I've never been so high(buh da da) 
She's got wings(buh da da)
She's got wings(buh da da) .
She's got buh da da da da da
Yeah
The three words that she whispered to me
I Said I love you too we were meant to be
Then I closed my eyes, thank God for she
Got the keys to my heart she controls to be
Got this one question making me think
How can she inspire this song to sing
I'm the only one thinking 'bout buying a ring
This girl's an angel she's got wings
She opened up my eyes to show me she can fly 
She kissed my lips and said I've never been so high(she's got wings)(buh da da)
She's got wings(she got wings)(buh da da)
She's got wings(she got wings)(buh da da) 
She's got
Buh da da da da da
She's got wings(buh da da) (Hey!)
She's got wings(buh da da) 
She's got 
Buh da da da da da
She opened up my eyes to show me she can fly
She's got wings(She's got wings)(buh da da) 
She's got wings(She's got wings)(buh da da) 
She's got buh da da da da da(Ooh she's got 'em, Ooh she's got em)
She's got wings(OOH)(buh da da) 
She's got wings(She's got wings)(buh da da) 
She's got 
Buh da da da da da
