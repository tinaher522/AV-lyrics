<song artist="Jason_Derulo" title="Addicted">
Spadez and derulo
Look at her, look at her
Call me crazy if she aint the finest thing in this place, in this place
Type of girl would hate to see you go with love to watch or walk away, girl walk away
I get the feelin' that she's willin' to be all mine
When she's wit it im addicted to her back side
So addicted, bottoms got an apple in it, wanna feel it
Bottoms got an apple in it, so addicted, bottoms got an apple in it wanna feel it? bottoms got an apple in it
Her back so ridonkulous, it's so ridonkulous, her back is so ridonkulous
Her mind'll put her onto this her back is so ridonkulous
How did she get this way
Her back is so, her back is so, her back is so ridonkulous
Shawty whats in your pants i think you got an apple in em 
Come back to the tele girl im tryina get you out that denim
Girl that thing be killin me , you got that booty venom
If them buns is in my vision imma go ahead n get em
I love it when you walkin dunk is movin left n right
Baby im addicted and i wanna taste you're cake all night
So addicted, bottoms got an apple in it, wanna feel it
Bottoms got an apple in it, so addicted, bottoms got an apple in it wanna feel it? bottoms got an apple in it
Her back is so ridonkulous, it's so ridonkulous, her back is so ridonkulous
Her mind'll put her onto this, her back is so ridonkulous
How did she get this way
Her back is so, her back is so, her back is so ridonkulous
Damn it's so ridonkulous i wanna just hop onto this
I aint the violent type but baby i just wanna hit
Your momma gave it to you and i gotta thank her for it 
That booty like a soccer ball ooh n i just gotta score it
I got a proposition baby take itÂ ? let me get that apple in 
I'll give u this banana, drop it on my wood up and down like a hammer
