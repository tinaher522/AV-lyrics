<song artist="Jason_Derulo" title="Perfect">
Oh yeah
(you make me, you make me)
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
(you make me)
Yeah yeah
I nearly lost my mind
Tryna figure out a way
To make you understand
I can't go on another day
Baby i was wrong
Been confused and let astray
Please give me one more chance
Cos i can't take what's happening
Have you ever lost someone (yeah)
Tried to take them back
But the damage is done
Thought of losing you
Makes me feel so sad
How am i gonna sleep
When it feels this bad
I know enough is enough
It's going to be tough to get through this
I'll never be perfect
I'll never be cool
I'll always be noting
Unless I'm with you
Cos you make me perfect
Tell me what can i do
The pieces are missing
When I'm not with you
You make me
(ooooh) you make me
(ooooh) you make me
You make me
(ooooh) you make me
(ooooh) you make me
You make me
I know that i deserve it
But have you really lost all faith
You know inside that we're worth it
There's so much left for us to say
Baby i was lost
Or maybe i was just afraid
Could you please forgive me
And hold me in your arms again
Have you ever lost someone (yeah)
Tried to take them back
But the damage is done (oh yeah)
Thought of losing you
Makes me feel so sad
How am i gonna sleep
When it feels this bad
I know enough is enough
It's going to be tough to get through this
I'll never be perfect
I'll never be cool
I'll always be nervous
Unless I'm with you (unless I'm with you)
Cos you make me perfect
Tell me what can i do (oh yeah)
The pieces are missing
When I'm not with you
You make me
(ooooh) you make me
(ooooh) you make me
You make me
(ooooh) you make me
(ooooh) you make me
You make me
Don't say nothing's perfect
Cos it isn't true
Everything i need is here with you
Everything i see so clear with you
Everything i dream of this with you
(?) yeah
Damn..
Perfect ooh yeah yeah
I'll never be perfect (perfect)
I'll never be cool (no)
I'll always be nervous
Unless I'm with you
Cos you make me perfect
Tell me what can i do (what can i do baby)
The pieces are missing (oh)
When I'm not with you
Cos you make me whole
You make me
So whole
You make me
When I'm with you baby
Oh yeah
You make me
So whole
Eh yeah
You make me
Oh yeah
You make me perfect
So perfect
So perfect
You make me
Perfect oh
