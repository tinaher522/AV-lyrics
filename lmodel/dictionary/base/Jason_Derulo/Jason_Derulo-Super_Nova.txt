<song artist="Jason_Derulo" title="Super_Nova">
Lipstick stains all over my cigarette
5 inch heels I'm always ahead in set 
I got the roof off in my car 
Add a little heat let's spice it up 
(Let's spice it up now) 
10 shillings all on me, spotlight, now follow me
All the cameras flashing
Baby, acts are spreading
Papparatzi sneak on the scene
Gotta' keep em' asking
But they keep on stressing on me
Saying you aint' got nothing on me
You can keep on hating
Put all my hate to a block cus' I keep on walking
Gone through the light
These flashing lights go by, I'm so high
There's a runway just for me in the sky 
I never seen a star, with this kind'a exposure, solar 
I'm explosive like a Super Nova 
(I'm so like a superstar) 
(Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, I'm so like a superstar) 
(Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah  I'm so like a superstar)
(Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah  I'm so like a superstar)
(Yeah, Yeah, Yeah) 
Hey sexy,(Nah Ah)that line don't flatter me 
Got my face all up on your twitter
And I know you follow me
Don't say that I'm looking too much
You told me once filling up my car 
I'm number one and your tryn'a catch up
Tell me why would you wann'a break up? 
All the cameras flashing
Baby, acts are spreading
Papparatzi sneak on the scene
Gotta' keep em' asking
But they keep on stressing on me
Saying you aint' got nothing on me
You can keep on hating
Put all my hate to a block cus' I keep on walking
Gone through the light
These flashing lights go by, I'm so high
There's a runway just for me in the sky 
I never seen a star, with this kind'a exposure, solar 
I'm explosive like a Super Nova  
I'm so seductive love
Never get a grip on me
I just cant have it then
Then I just aint' having it
I'm so destructive love
Gotta' keep your eyes on me
I just can't have it then
Then I just aint' having it 
Gone through the light
These flashing lights go by, I'm so high
There's a runway just for me in the sky 
I never seen a star, with this kind'a exposure, solar 
I'm explosive like a Super Nova  
Gone through the light
These flashing lights go by, I'm so high
There's a runway just for me in the sky 
I never seen a star, Like this kind'a exposure, solar 
I'm explosive like a Super Nova  
Just like a super nova, (yeah) 
Just like a super nova, (yeah x3)
Just like a super nova, (yeah x4) 
Just like a super nova, (yeah x4) 
Like, like a super nova,(yeah x3)
