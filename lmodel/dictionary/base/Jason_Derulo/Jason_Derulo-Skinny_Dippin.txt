Raise our self and put heat to the firee, doing jst what we desire
Living our life on the wire,
Skinny dippin';

Skinny dippin';
Im not trippin';
Turn the key in your ignition;
Lose ur mind and find that im not trippin'
Risk it all to live the life im livin'
Follow me and we'll lose our clothes and slip in,
We skinny dippin'
Now jump, ohhh ohhh ohhh ohhh ohhhhhhhhhh
Anything i get, off off off off offfffffffffff
Start your life and jst take off off off off offfffffff
Turn your key inside your own ignition,
We, SKINNY DIPPIN'
