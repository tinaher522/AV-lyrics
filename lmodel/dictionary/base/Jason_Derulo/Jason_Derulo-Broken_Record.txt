<song artist="Jason_Derulo" title="Broken_Record">
Girl you've been good to me for so long 
And i know what i did was wrong 
But this time, this time, this time, Im'a change 
I wont lie to you no more 
I know you heard this song before 
But this time,this time, this this time,is not the same 
Take a, take a, take a, another chance 
I know i don't deserve to have your love ever again 
But i need you baby yeahhh... 
How can i make it, make it, make it up to you 
Your wish is my command give me your hand and i'll do 
Cuz it hurts me when you say, 
I sound like a broken record, record, record 
A broken record, record, record 
All the times i said i was gonna change 
Im'a sound like a broken record 
A broken record, record, record 
Every time i lie, your ears bleed with pain 
Form the sounds of a broken record 
I didn't know what i had till you left 
Since you've been gone my life's been a mess 
I'm sorry, sorry, sorry i'm too blame 
The times you took me back, it got worse 
Wish i could take back all the hurt 
I'm sorry, sorry, so sorry, i'm ashamed. 
Please, take a, take a, take another chance 
I know i don't deserve to have your love ever again 
But i need you baby, yeahhh... 
How can i make it, make it, make it up to you 
Your wish is my command give me your hand and i'll do 
Cuz it hurts me when you say, 
I sound like a broken record, record, record 
A broken record, record, record 
All the times i said i was gonna change 
Im'a sound like a broken record 
A broken record, record, record 
Every time i lie, your ears bleed with pain 
Form the sounds of a broken record
