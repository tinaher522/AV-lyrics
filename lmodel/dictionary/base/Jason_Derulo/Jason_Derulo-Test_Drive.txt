Baby I got it, got what you need
Wanna take you places you may never wanna leave
Let me be ya driver, I'll take you wherever
Let me sit behind ya, lay it on my leather

As long as the light is green
Tell me that you ready, I'll go (go)
Caution Imma take it slow (slow)
Like aww baby, aww baby, aww baby
Gimme a test drive (ey) so I can take you for a ride
After midnight (ey) we'll go downtown
Gimme a test drive (ey) gimme a test drive
