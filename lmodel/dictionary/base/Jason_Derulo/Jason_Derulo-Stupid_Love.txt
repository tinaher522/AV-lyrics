<song artist="Jason_Derulo" title="Stupid_Love">
Walking the dog in my neighborhood
Said I never would for you
I got drunk on a money night
Hope it looks alright
Tattoo a few, uh
I'm a yes man on the loose
Black star on my credit card
Bought your favorite car, times two
I'm crazy for you
Lord know what I'd do
I'd even die for you
Whatever you need
I'm down on my knees
I guess that means
I guess that means
I'm dam da da rid a dam
Dam da da rid a dam
Dam da da rid a dam
Stupid love
Dam da da rid a dam
Dam da da rid a dam
Dam da da rid a dam
Stupid
I'm stupid in love, stupid
Can't believe I did
It's true, it's true
I'm a shame but I kiss the face
With you, with you
Cause I'm a yes man on the loose
And I'll do anything for you
I'm crazy for you
Lord know what I'd do
I'd even die for you
Whatever you need
I'm down on my knees
I guess that means
I guess that means
I'm dam da da rid a dam
Dam da da rid a dam
Dam da da rid a dam
Stupid love
Dam da da rid a dam
Dam da da rid a dam
Dam da da rid a dam
Stupid
I'm stupid in love, stupid
And they can all call me crazy (crazy)
I'm a fool for you baby (baby)
But they ain't never seen you naked, naked
And they can all call me crazy
I'm a fool for you baby (baby)
But they ain't never seen you naked, naked
I'm crazy for you
Lord know what I'd do
I'd even die for you
Whatever you need
I'm down on my knees
I guess that means
I guess that means
I'm dam da da rid a dam
Dam da da rid a dam
Dam da da rid a dam
Stupid love
Dam da da rid a dam
Dam da da rid a dam
Dam da da rid a dam
Stupid
I'm stupid in love, stupid
