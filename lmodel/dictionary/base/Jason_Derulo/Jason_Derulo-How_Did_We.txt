<song artist="Jason_Derulo" title="How_Did_We">
Lately i've been thinking babe, things just aint the same
We went from being friends, to lovers arguing
Its like all we do is fight, but i try to compromise
Its so hard for me to let this go, but i just  feel like you need to know
I dont wanna say good bye, just wish we could rewind
Go back in time back when everything was fine
Ohh just wish we could undo, go back to being cool
Ohh can you please
Tell me how did we get (we get)
So comfortable
How did we get
So far from wonderful
How did we get (we get)
Close to the end
How did we get (how did we get)
How did we fall out of love
Of love (of love) x3
How did we fall out of love
Should we just take a break, we've got so much at stake
Too delicate to choose, cause either way we lose
The day we took the steps, we knew we'd both regret
We did it anyway there's nothing left to say
But i dont wanna say good bye, just wish we could rewind
Go back in time back when everything was fine
Ohh just wish we could undo, go back to being cool
Ohh can you please
Tell me how did we get (we get)
So comfortable
How did we get
So far from wonderful
How did we get (we get)
Close to the end
How did we get (how did we get)
How did we fall out of love
Of love (of love) x3
How did (tell me how did we get)
( we get we get)
Ohh can you please
So comfortable
How did we get
So far from wonderful
How did we get (we get)
Close to the end
How did we get (how did we get)
How did we fall out of love
Of love (of love) x3
How did we fall out of love
