Hit me with a text!
Let me know your home alone,
freaky with that camera phone
Hit you with a text!
Got me on your favorite ringtone,
Lately, that's your favorite song
Hit me with a, text!
It could go down,
Hit me and I'll be around
Hit you with a, text!
On the low,
nobody'll have to know
Just hit me with a text
Ahhh, she hit me up in the morning,
she be textin', when she stretchin' and yawnin'
She be like "good mornin'"
I be like "good mornin'"
While I'm makin' cereal, the milk I be pourin'
And I'm eating breakfast, 
never gettin' restless
Like I live in Dallas, 
the way I be readin' texts
Very interestin',
always the worst,
when she be gettin' freaky
but don't do it in person
She be tryin' to tease me,
and my ude, it be workin'
When it be workin', the text message be jerkin',
Yeahhhhhh...
That's why I love my female,
She send me naked pics,
straight to my e-mail
Baby girl, thick, so she must eat well
Got my head spinnin',
like some shiny free whales
Ya'll, I might do phone-sex,
but we get it in,
when she hit me with a text
Hit me with a text!
Let me know your home alone,
freaky with that camera phone,
Hit you with a text! 
Got me on your favorite ringtone,
Lately, that's your favorite song
Hit me with a, text!
It could go down,
Hit me and I'll be around
Hit you with a, text,
on the low,
nobody'll have to know,
Just hit me with a text
Yeah, hit me on the A.M.,
as long as she get at me,
I don't care, it's all the same,
and when her phone rang,
My ringtone playin', like
Hit me with a text!
Mann is on the brain,
I love her screen name,
a lace top cutie, 
and her icion is a pic of her booty,
Say she miss me, and we see each other often,
Don't call, girl, let the finger do the talkin'
What, she want the business?
She ain't gotta worry,
text me girl, and I'll  be there in a hurry
Yeahhh
I still love my chick,
though she gettin' mad,
when other girls are on my "ohhhhhhh!"
I got my own category on her buddy list,
I know that I'm in first, if I'm not, I gon' be pissed
Ya'll might do phone sex,
but we get it in, when she hit me on the text,
Hit me with a text!
Let me know your home alone,
Freaky with that camera phone,
Hit you with a text,
Got me on your favorite ringtone,
Lately, that's your favorite song,
Hit me with a, text!
It could go down,
Hit me and I'll be around,
Hit you with a, text!
On the low,
Nobody'll have to know
Just hit me with a text
Ugh, when you alone in your room,
you got that number, and you know what to do,
Send me a text,
Ugh, and you be bought them sexy drawls
Trust me, girl, you ain't gotta call
Send me a text
Baby girl, what you doin?
What you got on?
Send it to me on my phone (my phoooooone)
Don't worry, girl, I'll keep it on the low
Just hit me with a text for sure
Hit me with a text!
Hit me with a text!
Let me know your home alone, (home aloooone!)
Freaky with that camera phone (freaky freaky camera phone)
Hit you with a text,
Got me on your favorite ringtone, (shawty)
Lately, that's your favorite song
Hit me with a, text! (text!)
It could go down, (go down!)
Hit me and I'll be around,
Hit you with a, text, (text!)
on the low,
nobody'll have to know,
just hit me with a text
