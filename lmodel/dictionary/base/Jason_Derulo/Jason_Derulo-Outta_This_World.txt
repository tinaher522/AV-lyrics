Jason Derulo
(Hmmm uuuuuhh Yeah)
I think that you've fallen from the stars
Somewhere beyond here, maybe Mars
Cuz you're nothin like the girls that I've seen
(Baby you're outta this world)
Without warning, without a sign
You made a crash landing, changed my life
Your love remains a mystery
(Baby you're outta this world)
Life is ahead of the rest time
Can't believe that you all mine
Life with you makes me feel like
I can do impossible
See stars in your eyes
Smile like the sunrise
Your love makes me feel incredible
Your love is outta this world
(Your love is outta this world)
Your love is outta this world
(Your love is outta this world)
Like somethin' out a UFO
Like somethin' out a UFO
(o-o-o-o-o-w a UFO)
(o-o-o-o-o-w a UFO)
Your love is outta this world
Stuck in my system, need you now
Just like gravity you hold me down
It seems you have walked right outta my dreams
(Baby you're outta this world)
Ohhh yeahhh
It's like you're in my mind, know what i need
You take me to space I can barely breath
You broke through my forcefield, invaded my heart
(heart, heart)
Life is ahead of the rest time
Can't believe that you all mine
Life with you makes me feel like
I can do impossible
See stars in your eyes
Smile like the sunrise
Your love makes me feelin
(incredible)
Your love is outta this world
(Your love is outta this world)
Your love is outta this world
(Your love is outta this world)
Like something outta UFO
Like something outta UFO
(o-o-o-o-o-w a UFO)
(o-o-o-o-o-w a UFO)
Your love is outta this world
(Your love is outta this world)
Girl your love is outta this world
(Your love is outta this world)
Your love is outta this world
(Your love is outta this world)
Girl your love is outta this world
(Your love is outta this world)
