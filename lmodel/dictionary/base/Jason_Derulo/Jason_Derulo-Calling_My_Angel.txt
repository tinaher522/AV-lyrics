<song artist="Jason_Derulo" title="Calling_My_Angel">
Found myself in a dark room all day
(All day, all day, all day)
Hoping the silence
Would take this pain away
(Away, away
Cos no one else is here
To wipe away my tears
When they fall (oh no)
And no one hears me screaming, 
But these four walls
So I'm calling out your name
Hoping you'd hear me (hear me)
Got both hands on my heart
Hoping you'd feel me (feel me)
Cos baby I feel you when I close my eyes
Calling out for you, I can't sleep at night
Can someone help me find my angel
Cos every breath I take without, is painful
Please someone, help me find my angel
Cos I know she's hear me calling
Hear me calling, calling, calling for my angel
Calling for my angel, I'm calling for my angel
Wherever I'll be, 
Calling, calling, calling for my angel
Calling for my angel, I'm calling for my angel
Now, who's gonna pick me up
When I fell down (down)
You left with a part of me
The air is thinning, 
It's getting so hard to breathe
(Breathe, breathe)
Breathe, 
Try to take the pain away with this pen
But I just keep writing your name over again
No one can take your place (no)
Life without you is impossible
So I'm calling out your name
Hoping you'd hear me (hear me)
Got both hands on my heart
Hoping you'd feel me (feel me)
Cos baby I feel you when I close my eyes
Calling out for you, cos I need you in my life
Can someone help me find my angel
Cos every breath I take without, is painful
Please someone, help me find my angel
Cos I know she's hear me calling
Hear me calling, calling, calling for my angel
Calling for my angel, I'm calling for my angel
Wherever I'll be, 
Calling, calling, calling for my angel
Calling for my angel, I'm calling for my angel
Yeah hmmm
Just put your hands in the air
If you're missing somebody
Come home
Cos I can't handle this alone
Can someone help me find my angel
Cos every breath I take without, is painful
(Baby, baby come home)
Please someone, help me find my angel
(I know you hear me)
Cos I know she's hear me calling (ooh)
Hear me calling, calling, calling for my angel
Calling for my angel, I'm calling for my angel
Got me singing oooh, 
Calling, calling, calling for my angel
Calling for my angel, I'm calling for my angel
