<song artist="Jason_Derulo" title="Make_It_Up_As_We_Go">
We don't need a label
What we got is sexy
If you like it, i love it
You let me in, they told me to
Come back again
You into me, i'm into you
That's all that matters girl, it's beautiful
You're so sweet like candy
You're so sweet like candy
What we got, what we got
So so sweet like candy
And no label on it
And no label on it
What e got, what we got
Let's make it up as we go
Don't stop the party, it's just getting
Started
Make it up as we go, i know you
Want it
I'm all upon it
What we got is sexy
What we got is sexy
Baby come undress me
Let's make it up as we go
Make it up, make it up girl
Make it up, make it up
Make it up, make it up girl
Your friend's a met, hating cause
We've got no strings attached
I know you would agree life is
Hella good
But every nasty piece is
Misunderstood, misunderstood
You're so sweet like candy
You're so sweet like candy
What we got, what we got
So so sweet like candy
And no label on it
And no label on it
What we got, what we got
Let's make it up as we go
Don't stop the party, it's just getting
Started
Make it up as we go, i know you
Want it
I'm all upon it
What we got is sexy
What we got is sexy
Baby come undress me
Let's make it up as we go
Make it up, make it up girl
Make it up, make it up
Make it up, make it up girl
Isn't this good for you, aha
As it is for me aha
I dig it, i dug it, for real
Isn't this good for you, aha
As it is for me aha
I dig it, i dug it, so real
Make it up as we go
Don't stop the party, it's just getting
Started
Make it up as we go, i know you
Want it
I'm all upon it
What we got is sexy
What we got is sexy
Baby come undress me
Let's make it up as we go
