<song artist="Jason_Derulo" title="Cheyenne">
I'm a little unsure how it got so complicated
If I let go I know I'll regret it
Every heart that I held before, I was sure to break it
I don't know what you did but
I just can't stop
Thinking about you everyday
No I can't stop now
Look what we started baby
You're not what I expected 'cause
All I ever wanted was some fun
Look what we started baby
I used to look for exits cause
All I ever wanted was some fun
I never meant to fall in love
I never meant to fall in love
I never meant to fall in love
I never meant to fall in love
Cheyenne
Got the table set for two guess you couldn't make it
Thought I kissed your lips again, I was dreaming
Still believe that night we shared was something sacred
I'm try'na clear my head but
I just can't stop
Thinking about your everyday
No I can't stop now
Look what we started baby
You're not what I expected 'cause
All I ever wanted was some fun
Look what we started baby
I used to look for exits cause
All I ever wanted was some fun
I never meant to fall in love
I never meant to fall in love
I never meant to fall in love
I never meant to fall in love
Cheyenne
Cheyenne
Cheyenne
Cheyenne
No I can't stop
Thinking bout you everyday
No I can't stop now
Look what we started baby
You're not what I expected 'cause
All I ever wanted was some fun
Look what we started baby
I used to look for exits cause
All I ever wanted was some fun
Cheyenne (I never meant to fall in love)
Cheyenne (I never meant to fall in love)
Cheyenne (I never meant to fall in love)
Cheyenne (I never meant to fall in love)
Cheyenne
