<song artist="Jason_Derulo" title="Heart_Break_Hotel">
You ever met a girl
That was so fine
That you didnt even care
If she broke your heart  
Well i met that girl
Welcome to HeartBreak Hotel
[verse 1]
See you from across the room
Lookin' like some trouble I'd like to get into
I'm willing to be used
Just have your way
I'll be your slave and you'll be mine to
Your body so hipnotic
And I know you wanna play
Dont worry 'bout it
I lost my sanity
So girl lets go away from here
My heart is cold
[bridge]
You can have it
You can hold it
Take my heart girl you control it
But you can brake my heart
When you touch me, love the feelin
Now my heart stops
My heart stops beating
But you can brake my heart
[Chrous]
No, i dont mind
Your just that fine
Lets get away
To my Heart Break Hotel
Come break my heart -yeah-
Come break my heart
Come Break my heart
At my Heart Break Hotel
[verse 2]
Dont be afraid to come closer babe
I want you to lay
Right next to me
I'm gunna keep the ligths on
Wanna see everything
Rip my cloths off 
Want you to torture me
Make yourself at home, baby this is the place
Now that were alone, no thats no mistake
The perfect sin, the perfect sacandal
Just give me more then i can handle
[bridge]
You can have it
You can hold it
Take my heart girl you control it
But you can brake my heart
When you touch me, love the feelin
Now my heart stops
My heart stops beating
But you can brake my heart
[Chorus]
No, i dont mind
Your just that fine
Lets get away
To my Heart Break Hotel
Come break my heart -yeah-
Come break my heart
Come Break my heart
At my Heart Break Hotel
-breathing-yeah, yeah
-breathing-yeah,yeah
[verse 3]
Its so quite you can hear my heart drop
And my Heart Break Hotel doors lock
Dont worry 'bout the time cause I do away the clock
Cause we could which rows; Let you take control
[chorus]
Cause I dont mind
Your just that fine
Lets get away
To my Heart Break Hotel
Come break my heart 
Come break my heart
Come break my heart
Come break my heart
Ohhohh
Come and break
Come and break
My heart
Slow me down...
(2x)
-breathing- yeah, yeah
