<song artist="Jason_Derulo" title="Imagination">
(yeah)
(ah ah ah ah ah)
I still hear your soft whisper in my ear. In my ear (yeah)
And when sometimes I close my eyes
You appear, you appear
I can still smell
The scent of your perfume in my room
And when I'm cookin' dinner
I still set the table for two
I can still feel the warmth of ya body under me right now
I bet cha think It's crazy
I bet I got cha wonderin' how
In my mind you're still here
I still feel you here
No you never left my side
My heart says you're here
And I believe that you're here
No I don't have to say goodbye
In my imagination, in my imagination
In my imagi-magi-nation
In my imagination
My bad memory need replacin'
In my imagi-magi-nation
There's still moisture on the pillows
When we cried. Oh when we cried (yeah)
Now I wake up every mornin'
'pologise, apologise (mmhmm)
Mama always said
Better late than never
It makes me feel better when I talk to you (ah haa)
I can still taste
The sweetness from lips right now (right now)
I bet cha think it's crazy
I bet I got you wonderin' ho-o-o-ow
In my mind you're still here I still feel you here 
No you never left my side 
My heart says you're here 
And I believe that you're here 
Don't have to say goodbye
In my imagination, in my imagination
In my imagi-magi-nation
In my imagination
My bad memory needs replacin'
In my imagi-imagi-nation
Thought I heard you call out my name today
It was the most beautiful melody I've heard in a long time (time)
Imagination runnin' wild (it's all in my mind)
I know you weren't there (now) 
But I answered anywa-a-a-ay (ha ha ha ha ha ha-a-a-a-a)
Call me crazy. So? I don't care
Couldn't breathe when I didn't have you near (oh no!)
I need the love that we shared so I imagine you here
Look me in my eyes
Tell me it's OK
I'm just glad that you are here babe
(Woahh)
In my mind you're still here, I still feel you here
No you never left my side
My heart says you're here (oh nooo)
And I believe that you're here
No you don't have to say goodbye-e-e-e-e-e
In my imagination, (woah woah woah) in my imagination 
In my imagi-magi-nation 
In my imagination 
(in my imagination)
(you can live here in my ma-ma-mind)
My bad memory needs replacin' 
In my imagi-imagi-nation
