<song artist="Jason_Derulo" title="Fight_For_You">
It's gonna take a lot to drag me
Away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more
Could ever do
Just like the rains down in Africa
It's gonna take some time but
I know you're worth fighting for
I fight for you
I fight for you
I fight for you
Let them cool
We both know
They don't wanna see us together
Don't wanna lose
What I live for
I'm willing to do whatever
Cause I don't wanna see you cry
Give it another try
I better get it right this time
As long as your prepared to fight
I don't wanna live another day
Dump ya body next to me
I'm not gonna let them break us down
Cause baby I know now
It's gonna take a lot to drag me
Away from you
(I fight for you)
There's nothing that a hundred men or more
Could ever do
(I fight for you)
Just like the rains down in Africa
(I fight for you)
It's gonna take some time but
I know you're worth fighting for
What they say
It don't even matter
They don't really understand
Without eachother
We are barely breathin'
Let's get air in these hearts again
Cause I don't wanna see you cry
Give it another try
I better get it right this time
As long as your prepared to fight
Prepared to fight
I don't wanna live another day
Dump ya body next to me
I'm not gonna let them break us down
Cause baby I know now
Know now
Know now
It's gonna take a lot to drag me
Away from you
(I fight for you)
There's nothing that a hundred men or more
Could ever do
(I fight for you)
Just like the rains down in Africa
(I fight for you)
It's gonna take some time but
I know you're worth fighting for
I fight for you
If you got someone that's worth fighting for
Don't let nobody hold ya down
Let me hear you say, woah (woah)
Oh woah (oh woah)
If you done someone that wasn't worth for
No one can live without
Let me hear you say, woah (woah)
Oh woah (oh woah)
It's gonna take a lot to drag me
Away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more
Could ever do
(I fight for you)
Just like the rains down in Africa
(I fight for you)
It's gonna take some time but
I know you're worth fighting for
It's gonna take a lot to drag me
Away from you
(I fight for you)
There's nothing that a hundred men or more
Could ever do
(I fight for you)
Just like the rains down in Africa
(I fight for you)
It's gonna take some time but
I know you're worth fighting for
