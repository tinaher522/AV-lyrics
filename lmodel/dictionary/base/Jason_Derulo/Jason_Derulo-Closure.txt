<song artist="Jason_Derulo" title="Closure">
Put your bags down for a second,
Look me in my eyes babe
Wont you lay down for a second
Never thought id say
That i,
Can hardly
Breathe
Knowing its your last time next to me
My babys next to me.
And i aint gonna tell nobody, 
If you aint gonna tell nobody,
I just wanna love yo body,
Before we say goodbye,
Before we say goodbye
Lets make love love love
For the last time (for the last time)
And call this closure
Were just gonna call this closure
Lets make love, love, love
For the last time (for the last time)
And call this closure
Were just gonna call this closure
Woahhh
Woah(oh)
Woah(oh)
Woahhh
So were just gonna call this closure
Woahhh
Savour the moment
Let me just lay your body down
We could just savour the moment
The last time, so ima make it count.
But you wont want to leave 
So stay here and sleep next to me,
Right here next to me.
And i aint gonna tell nobody, 
If you aint gonna tell nobody,
I just wanna love yo body,
Before we say goodbye,
Before we say goodbye
Lets make love love love
For the last time (for the last time)
And call this closure
Were just gonna call this closure
Lets make love love love
For the last time (for the last time)
And call this closure
Were just gonna call this closure
Woahh
