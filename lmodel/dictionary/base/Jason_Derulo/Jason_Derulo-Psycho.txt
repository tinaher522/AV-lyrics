<song artist="Jason_Derulo" title="Psycho">
I'm reading you baby it's all on your face
It says you wanna be crazy come back to my place
Love your jeans don't mind if u lose them
Love your heels don't mind if u use them
Dont be scared I know what I'm doing
I know we just met
Lose control
Help me get my head right babe babe babe
Help me get my head right just for tonight
Everybody everybody, everybody everybody, everybody everybody
Everybody gets a little psycho
Psycho
I'm the voice in your head girl I wont stay you wrong
I can make u a star just sing in my microphone
Love your lipstick I wanna sniff it
Love your body I wanna feel it
It's your life so baby just live it
I know we just met
Lose control
Help me get my head right babe babe babe
Help me get my head right just for tonight
Everybody everybody, everybody everybody, everybody everybody
Everybody gets a little psycho
Oh oh oh oewoohoho
Psycho
