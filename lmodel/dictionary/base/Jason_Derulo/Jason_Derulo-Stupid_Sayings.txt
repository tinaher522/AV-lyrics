<song artist="Jason_Derulo" title="Stupid_Sayings">
They say think that you can do it
No crying till it's gone
They say what if you don't need it
You had it all along
They say not enough talking today
Drinking only hours away
They say, next time never the same as the first time
Baby, we just torn up and this doesn't mean that you're not priceless
No one listens, they keep asking, how did it get this way
They say nothing lasts forever, so i'm living for today
See i listen to what they say and i push your love away
Stupid sayings, oho, stupid sayings, oho
Stupid sayings, oho, stupid sayings, oho.
