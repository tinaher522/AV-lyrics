<song artist="Jason_Derulo" title="Panic">
I put my feet in the soup oh oh oh yaa
I lay a huge poop oh oh oh ya
I take a moment to wipe it away oh oh oh ya 
I deny the fact that i am gay
Oh oh oh ya (luda!) when i was just twelve
My name was carter melv, i went down to the county and i had it changed to this. oh
I used to be a baby, but now im big and hiary so i just keep on sayin' 
Oh oh oh yaeaeaeeeeeaaaaahhhhhhhaaaaaahhhh derulo
