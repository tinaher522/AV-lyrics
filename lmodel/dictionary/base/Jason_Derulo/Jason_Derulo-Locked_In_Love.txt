<song artist="Jason_Derulo" title="Locked_In_Love">
I keep (keep keep)
Fallin (lin lin) 
I keep fallin in love all over again (again again) 
Cause he's (he's he's) got me, 
He's got me locked here like a crook and I don't wanna be singing like 
Tryna free myself from loving again, 
But cupid has me captive, stuck here with him. 
Today I made my mind, I said goodby-e 
Stay anyway. 
Can't take that look in his eye 
Where would I go if I left here? 
Though I've had enough of these tears, life without him is unclear
Can I just get away? 
All these questions I'm asking 
When I should be packing 
I'm in, then I'm out, then back in, cause he's got a hold on me 
I keep (keep keep) 
Fallin (lin lin) 
I keep fallin in love all over again (again again) 
Cause he's (he's he's) got me, 
He's got me locked here like a crook and I don't wanna be singing like 
Ayo, aaaay 
Trapped here like a prisoner, I'm locked in lo-ve 
Ayo, aaaay 
Take these shackles off me cause I'm locked in lo-ve 
Love, love, lo-ve, love, love 
I'm locked in love 
Love, love, lo-ve 
I'm locked in love 
How did my heart get locked in this cage 
With a life sentence 
Is this what they call fate? 
Cause if it is, 
I don't really want it. 
Happiness was all I ever wanted 
I'm moving on, making my mind 
I'm gonna leave him this time 
He barricades me with his lies. 
Why can't I get away? 
Over and over I stay 
Suppose he is my soul mate; 
I feel like I'm his enemy, 
Stuck for eternity. 
I keep (keep keep) 
Fallin (lin lin) 
I keep fallin in love all over again (again again) 
Cause he's (he's he's) got me, 
He's got me locked here like a crook and I don't wanna be singng like 
Ayo, aaaay 
Trapped here like a prisoner, I'm locked in lo-ve 
Ayo, aaaay 
Take these shackles off me cause I'm locked in lo-ve 
Love, love, lo-ve, love, love 
I'm locked in love 
Love, love, lo-ve 
I'm locked in love
