<song artist="Jason_Derulo" title="Sky's_The_Limit">
Yeah, Jason Derulo, yeah
Like a shock to my heart
When I saw you tonight
Like a dream come alive
For the very first time
When we touch in the dark
Baby, you're blowing my mind
Wish I could freeze you and me
In this moment in time
You got it but I won't give it up, shorty
Step it up for me and I'll give you everything
All my life, all my love, I give you my fortune and fame
I'll even give you my name
Girl, you take me higher
Then I've ever been before
My feet don't touch the floor
We'll fly
The sky's the limit
The sky's the limit
Girl, you take me
Up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up
Girl, you take me up
You take me higher
The sky's the limit
The sky's the limit
When we dance, when we kiss
Doesn't get any better than this
How you shine trapped in the spotlight
Finally mine, yeah
Baby, let's go, let's get out of here
Baby, let go, got nothing to fear
And now that we're here
Let's disappear into the night
You got it but I won't give it up, shorty
Step it up for me and I'll give you everything
All my life, all my love, I give you my fortune and fame
I'll even give you my name
Girl, you take me higher
Then I've ever been before
My feet don't touch the floor
We'll fly
The sky's the limit
The sky's the limit
Girl, you take me
Up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up
Girl, you take me up
You take me higher
The sky's the limit
The sky's the limit
My feet are on the ceiling
They don't wanna touch the ground anymore
Oh, what I feel, I can feel it
Can you feel it, feel it, feel it?
Girl, you take me higher
Then I've ever been before
My feet don't touch the floor
We'll fly
The sky's the limit
The sky's the limit
Girl, you take me
Up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up
Girl, you take me up
You take me higher
The sky's the limit
The sky's the limit
