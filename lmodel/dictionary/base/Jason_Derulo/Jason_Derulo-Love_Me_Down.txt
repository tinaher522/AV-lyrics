<song artist="Jason_Derulo" title="Love_Me_Down">
Oh, come on, girl and love me down, yeah
And let's go for what we know
Hold me so tight, yeah
And then love me, love me, love me down
Love me down
I go crazy when you love me, baby
Love me down
I go crazy when you love me, baby
Love me down
Ooh, love me down, baby, yeah
