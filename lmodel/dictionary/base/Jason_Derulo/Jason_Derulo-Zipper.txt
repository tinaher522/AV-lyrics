<song artist="Jason_Derulo" title="Zipper">
I’ma mark my territory
Shawty I’m an animal, slowly digging indios
Prey you like a bad story
Try you to a criminal; let me see you cut your back
Bang bang bang on it
Til the head ball break
Make me think that I wanna put a ring on you
But first I'll make you sign for me
And all the ladies say
I wanna ride
I wanna ride
Up and down like a zipper
Zipper, zipper, zipper
Up and down like a zipper
Zipper, zipper, zipper
I could be sweet, lady
Or eat it like a cannibal
Go places that you may can’t go
In my back seat baby
You’re smoking like some good good
Once I hate that good good
Make me beg beg for it
Mama touch you well
Cause it ain’t about booty but the brain baby
Now let me hear you sing for me
And all the ladies say
I wanna ride
I wanna ride
Up and down like a zipper
Zipper, zipper, zipper
Up and down like a zipper
Zipper, zipper, zipper
She like wearing my snap bags
She got that snap bag
So If I ever wanna leave
I’ll be right back
Ooh girl
I need it
Ooh girl
Got me feaning
You a ‘go’ girl
I never go girl
Cause when you surfing in my bed
I’ll be like go girl
Ooh girl
I need it
Ooh girl
Got me feaning
I wanna ride
I wanna ride
Up and down like a zipper
Zipper, zipper, zipper
Up and down like a zipper
Zipper, zipper, zipper
