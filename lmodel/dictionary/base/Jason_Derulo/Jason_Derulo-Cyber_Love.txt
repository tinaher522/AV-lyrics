(feat. MIMS)
We back
I am digital MIMS
I'm the king of the web
I ain't no R&amp;B singer but still I put you to bed
Show you how that super charge ride
Call that a hard drive
You get it?
A hard drive
And I'm passing them by like false side
I'm worldwide
Ya'll just want me to feel
Why?
100 foot docs
The world is mine
Coming soon (soon)
Til that time I bring youÂ…
JASON DERULO
Cyber luv (x 8)
Let's GO
I say your place or mine?
What's your address on line?
She said www HOTGIRL
Added her as a friend
She wanted me to log in
So I could www ROCK HER WORLD
COURUS:
Freaks like me just want to get physical
Who says we can't get far
Love is digital
Cyber (Cyber) Luv (x4)
I don't want to turn you off
But put your Micro-soft
Something on your website is making me hard drive
How'd you like it if I took you world-wide (world-wide)
We could get in to in back at my space
You could be my top friend
You could bring a few friends
If you're that kind of girl
COURUS
Cyber (Cyber) Luv (That's cyber love)
Cyber (Cyber) Luv (That's cyber love)
Cyber (Cyber) Luv (Mmm)
Cyber (Cyber) Luv (Yeah)
Cyber Love (x8)
Let's GO
I know you want me to press some key to be with you
And if we get closer download me to your bedroom
Tell me your password so I can get in
Press down the shift key so we can begin
You Got Mail (x 8)
CHORUS
Cyber (Cyber) Luv (That's cyber love)
Cyber (Cyber) Luv (That's cyber love)
