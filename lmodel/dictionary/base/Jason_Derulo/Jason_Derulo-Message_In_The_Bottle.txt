What if?
What if I'm the one for you?
And you're the one for me?
What If...?
If you are the one,
Then us meeting here is fate
Future with a dog named Ben
Buy a house with a fireplace
This is the first I've seen your face
But there's a chance we are soulmates
I know this might sound crazy,
Cause you don't know my name
But we can't, we can't tell, the future no
But that's just the beauty of the world we know
So imma say do do do do do
Baby, what if?
We could all say do do do do do
Baby what if?
What if (x6)
Picture me on one knee,
With the perfect diamond ring
We just met, but if you say "yes",
We'd have our wedding on the beach
It could happen, raise three kids
And grow old so happily.
I know this might sound crazy,
Cause I don't know your name
But we can't, we can't tell, the future no
But that's just the beauty of the world we know
So imma say do do do do do
Baby, what if?
We could all say do do do do do
Baby what if?
Don't know what tomorrow brings
But I'm still hoping,
That you are the one for me
Oh and what if i had you and
What if you had me and,
Baby what's the reason we can't fall in love?
What if..? (3x)
But we can't, we can't tell, the future no
But that's just the beauty of the world we know
So imma say do do do do do
Baby, what if?
We could all say do do do do do
Baby what if?
What if?
What if I'm the one for you?
And you're the one for me?
What If...?
If you are the one,
Then us meeting here is fate
