That girl is just so fresh
(yeah)
The way she look in her tight jeans and t-shirt
You know that I'm gone flirt
Cause shawty is a 10
(yeah)
And she don't even know it
(know it)
I really wanna get with her
I got a thing for her
I got a thing for her

I got a thing for her
I got a thing for her
And she don't even know it
