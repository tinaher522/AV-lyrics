<song artist="Jason_Derulo" title="X">
Oh yeah, love, love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love, love with my ex
I am still in love , love, love, love, love, love, love, love
Love, love with my ex
I know you can't stand me
And when you're angry
Something about that just turns me on
You're such a diva ,tought  i didn't need ya
But when you're close it's the same old song
I'm all over you, you're all over me
I hate that you love me so good, so good, so good
I can't live with or without you, i'm hooked, i'm hooked
Baby's so unusual, so unusual
How you want it, you want it
All the feel is mutual, is so mutual
And i'm on it, i can't stand it
I am still in love , love, love, love, love, love, love, love with my ex
I am still in love , love, love, love, love, love, love, love with my ex
Love with my ex
I see other people, just to be evil
It hurts to watch you do the same thing
But from a distance, girl i was missing
That you would come back like a boomerang and
I'm all over you, you're all over me
I hate that you love me so good, so good, so good
I can't live with or without you, i'm hooked, i'm hooked
Baby's so unusual, so unusual
How you want it, you want it
All the feel is mutual, is so mutual
And i'm on it, i can't stand it
I am still in love , love, love, love, love, love, love with my ex
I am still in love , love, love, love, love, love, love with my ex
Love with my ex
Love , love, love, love, love, love with my ex
It's got me thinking about we broken up, broken up baby
I still wanna lay you down, lay you down
We may be the perfect match ...
Don't wanna leave right now, leave right now
Cause
I'm all over you, you're all over me
Baby's so unusual, so unusual
How you want it, you want it
All the feel is mutual, is so mutual
And i'm on it, i can't stand it
I am still in love , love, love, love, love, love, love, love with my ex
I am still in love , love, love, love, love, love, love, love with my ex
Love with my ex
