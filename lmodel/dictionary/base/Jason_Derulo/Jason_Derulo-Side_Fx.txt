<song artist="Jason_Derulo" title="Side_Fx">
Prescription, addiction
Every defining
You had this
Positions, no mission
Every I give good
To the baddest
Head over hills stay fall
Take two of these and
Call me in the morning (call me in the morning).
Over the counter
I'm all up and down you
Spion this is your warning
Loving me is got a side fx
You lose your mind 'cause you try the best
And kind of hide that you've been trying to get
Loving me is got a side fx, side fx, sex sex sex
Make your body say
Make your booty say
All the girls at the bar
All the girls in the line
All the girls in the yard
All the girls
I'm all in your imagination
Baby I know every waiting
You'll be at the holiday and
Wait, where it's your
Hairs of high in your crystal long I'm a
Get you high
We don't need no door.
Head over hills stay fall
Take two of these and
Call me in the morning (call me in the morning).
Over the counter
I'm all up and down you
Spion this is your warning
Loving me is got a side fx
You lose your mind 'cause you try the best
And kind of hide that you've been trying to get
Loving me is got a side fx, side fx, sex sex sex
She flow, she sweet
Making, trying go deep,
Transform from the pants on,
To your birthday sooner them sheets
Versace, so what?
Face down, turn up
Her girlfriend from south beach,
In town tell em load up
Had a three song at the Lamar town
Trying to force on but the trunk
And we ain't poppin' no mollies man
Them girls do what they want
They all want me, me
They fall on me, me
So we're gonna do my long keep calm, bal on me.
Loving me is got a side fx
You lose your mind 'cause you try the best
And kind of hide that you've been trying to get
Loving me is got a side fx, side fx, sex sex sex
Loving me is got a side fx
You lose your mind 'cause you try the best
And kind of hide that you've been trying to get
Loving me is got a side fx, side fx, sex sex sex
Make your body say
Make your booty say
All the girls at the bar
All the girls in the line
All the girls in the yard
All the girls
Loving me is got a side fx
