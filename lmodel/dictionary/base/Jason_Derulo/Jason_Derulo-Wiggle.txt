<song artist="Jason_Derulo" title="Wiggle">
Hey, yo, Jason
Say somethin' to her
Holla at her
I got one question
How do you fit all that... in them jeans?
You know what to do with that big fat butt
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle
Just a little bit of
Swing
Patty cake, patty cake 
With no hands
Got me in this club making wedding plans
If I take pictures while you do your dance
I can make you famous on Instagram
Hot damn it
Your booty like two planets
Go head and go ham sandwich
Woah
I can't stand it
'Cause you know what to do with that big fat butt
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle
Just a little bit of
Swing
Cadillac, Cadillac, pop that trunk
Let's take a shot
Alley oop that dunk
Tired of working from 9 to 5
Oh baby, let me come and change your life
Hot damn it
Your booty like two planets
Go head and go ham sandwich
Woah
I can't stand it
'Cause you know what to do with that big fat butt
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle
Just a little bit of
Swing
Shake what your mama gave you
Misbehave you
I just wanna strip you, dip you, flip you, bubble bath you
What they do
Taste my rain drop, K boo
Now what you will and what you want and what you may do
Completely separated. til I deeply penetrated
Then I take I out and wipe it off
Eat it, ate it, love it, hate it
Overstated, underrated, everywhere I've been
Can you wiggle, wiggle for the D, O, double G, again?
Come on baby
Turn around
You're a star girl
Take a bow
It's just one thing that's killing me
How'd you get that in them jeans?
You know what to do with that big fat butt
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle
Just a little bit of
Now make it clap
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle
Now make it clap
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle
Make it clap
Now make it clap
Damn baby, you got a bright future behind you
