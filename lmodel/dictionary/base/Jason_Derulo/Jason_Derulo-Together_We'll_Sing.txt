<song artist="Jason_Derulo" title="Together_We'll_Sing">
Eighteen and he was sent from home
To fight a war that was not his own
He was fighting for his life paid the 
Ultimate price now his mothers all alone
They brought a flag to her door saying 
She wont see her only son no more 
Now she is she suppose to make it
When her precise life she hates it
A heart thats broken to the core. yeah
Do you hear the world crying cuz our people
Are dieing but  things will get better they'll 
Get better if we stick together and together we'll 
Sing.
Old man man x 16
She has forget she's a wife but she seems to be losing 
The fight she is dieing with cancer and no doctor has the answer soon with the angels she fly's.
It was his very first time and from her love he was blind
She wont go without a consult he doesn't see a problem test
Come back he cannot rewind do you hear the world crying 
Cuz people are dieing but things will get better they'll 
Get better if we stick together and together we'll 
Sing.
Old man man x16
