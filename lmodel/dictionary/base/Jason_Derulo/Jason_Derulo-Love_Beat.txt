<song artist="Jason_Derulo" title="Love_Beat">
Its party night im ready gonna hit the club 2night
My waiters goin' wild pretty lady by my side
She's standin' at the bar lookin' I candy to me
And the desfloor full's the magic trees become the a leally 
I can feel the fire taste and the giiii and I feel it all over me
My hopes is raisin higher to the beat of no melody
So listen to the lovebeat, lovebeat give it to my lovebeat (yaa)
Take it to my lovebeat (yaa) 
Party on the lovebeat, lovebeat party on it, party on it, party on it
Baby tonight 
So listen to the lovebeat, lovebeat give it to my lovebeat (yaa)
Take it to my lovebeat (yaa) 
Party on the lovebeat, lovebeat party on it, party on it, party on it
Baby tonight 
She moves her body close to playin with my fantasy 
She whispers in my ear and make me lose my gravity 
There's a new meaning to sexy where's she smiles and bites her lips 
As she dances to my lobby sending rhythms to her hips.
I can feel the fire taste in the giiiis and feel it all over me
My hope is raisin higher to the beat of no melody 
So listen to the lovebeat, lovebeat give it to my lovebeat (yaa)
Take it to my lovebeat (yaa)
Party on the lovebeat, lovebeat party on it, party on it, party on it
Baby tonight
I got a girl 
This girl fine 
Up in the club and she's on my mind 
Lovebeat baby like a heart beat line 
Award to the Shorty She a hotty and a dim 
She got the lovebeat I got the rhyme 
Hands in the air like we all want sex 
V.I.P with all eyes on you 
Coz the whole club knows she the best yes
So listen to my lovebeat, lovebeat give it to my lovebeat (yaa)
Take it to my lovebeat (yaa)
Party on the lovebeat, lovebeat party on it, party on it, party on it
Baby tonight
