<song artist="Jason_Derulo" title="Reason_To_Love">
You hoo hoo!
Baby you hoo hoo!
This ship is going down
This ship is going down
Come save my life right now
Save me before I drown
My heart is breaking down
My heart is breaking down
You can make this all better baby
Be my way out
Tell me you wanna be my baby
I turn in my player's card
Just say youÂ ? to save me
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Never had one to give my heart to
Three words never spoken
Baby there's no limit to what I give you what I give you
