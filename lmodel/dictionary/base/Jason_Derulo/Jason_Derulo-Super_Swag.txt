[Intro]
You, you rock me everytime
And I can't get enough.
There's a special way you grind
And can always find the spot
Oh, go girl, put me up against that wall
You got me standing that attention
Get on me, go drop it shawty
Can't stop what's going down tonight.
Refrain (2x):
Baby I got it, I got it bad
'Cause shawty got that super swag
Oh, show me how you working that
Pull me head up out this club, together
You, you went in like a boss
I'm keeping you in charge
Gotta' give you an applause
Cause your performance does it all
Oh, damn girl, we gon' have to leave this club
You got me standing at the entrance
Get on me, go drop it shawty
Can't stop what's going down tonight
Refrain (2x):
Baby I got it, I got it bad
'Cause shawty got that super swag
Oh, show me how you working that
Pull me head up out this club, together
Na, na, na, na (4x)
Refrain (2x):
Baby I got it, I got it bad
'Cause shawty got that super swag
Oh, show me how you working that
Pull me head up out this club, together
