<song artist="Jason_Derulo" title="Celebrity_Love">
She wanted to be, be with a celebreity
Wanted to see, see that she like him to deep
She wanted to go, to the parties, to shows
To the club, v.i.p, poppin bottles
Celebreity love
Shawty love that spotlight, i let her tag along to getta taste of the lime light
She likes nice cars and expsensive gifts, so i
Took her shoppin down sunset strip
Im talkin vip status, first class trips
We party with her friends in the club takin pics
I let her ride with me with the top drop back
Cause she know it aint nothin for the water blow sack (?)
Ass behind shades when the media split(?), the life of the party, center of attention
Glamourous life, is what shawty likes
She, can't get enough of the celebreity love
She wanted to be, be with a celebreity
Wanted to see, see that she like him to deep
She wanted to go, to the parties, to shows
To the club, v.i.p, poppin bottles
Celebreity love, love, love
She love, love
She can't get enough
Of celebreity love
Celebreity love, love, love
She love, love
She can't get enough
Of celebreity love
And lil mama stay dressed,wit the latest outfit
And everywhere she at paparazi takin flicks
Combind like the bar to resorts at the spas
At the award shows hangin out with stars
Like t.i. you can whatever you like
And i let her get whatever, dont worry about the price
Im just that nice, to put it in your life
Now have your self-esteem higher than the gas price
Interviews with the press, billboard, magazines
She like to ride big stretched out limozines
And roll the windows down just to be seen
She got a passion for light camera action
She wanted to be, be with a celebreity
Wanted to see, see that she like him to deep
She wanted to go, to the parties, to shows
To the club, v.i.p, poppin bottles
Celebreity love, love, love
She love, love
She can't get enough
Celebreity love
Celebreity love, love, love
She love, love
She can't get enough
Of celebreity love
Bad love
Bad love
