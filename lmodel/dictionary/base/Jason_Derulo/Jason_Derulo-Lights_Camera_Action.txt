<song artist="Jason_Derulo" title="Lights_Camera_Action">
I just wanna
I just wanna watch you baby
Yeah
Hmm
It's been a long day at work
Just wanna lay back
And watch you go to work
On me
Oh! Love it when you
Strip for me baby
Wanna watch you move
Oh! You can go slow
Lights, camera, action shawty
It's your song
Lights, camera, action
Start that acting
Lights, camera, action
The things that you do
When the lights are on you
The baddest on stage
Girl I'm so amazed
The way that you work it
Girl you're driving me crazy
Light are hot
And you're starting to sweat
But you end up on top
When it's quiet on set
Oh! Love it when you
Sing to me baby
Just moan when you're through
Ey! I've been waiting all day
When you need a close-up
I'm your
Lights, camera, action
Start that acting
Lights, camera, action
The things that you do
When the lights are on you
Lights, camera, action
Start that acting baby
Lights, camera, action
It's your big break
Baby let's play my actions
Lights, camera, action
Start that acting
Lights, camera, action
The things that you do
When the lights are on you
