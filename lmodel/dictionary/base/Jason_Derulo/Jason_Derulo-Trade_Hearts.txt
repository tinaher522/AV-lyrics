<song artist="Jason_Derulo" title="Trade_Hearts">
You say I don't have any time
To try and keep you satisfied
I call you crazy all the time
You say I'm so damn difficult
I save it which you're beautiful
You're tired of hearing the same lies
So I cry
Cry
And you don't know why
Why
So I wish I could trade hearts with you
So I can feel the same way you do
You do
Hey can you give me cynical
I hope it's not too difficult
Don't tell me I'm incapable
Cause I wanna scream the way you scream
I wanna bleed the way you bleed
But you only get half of me
So you cry
Oh yeah you cry
And I don't know why
So I wish I could trade hearts with you
So I can feel the same way you do
You do
Cause there's some things you just don't understand
Like how hard a woman loves a man
So I wish I could trade hearts with you
With you
Touch me
Till I feel your love on mine
Oh touch me, love me, now
Like it's me that's crying
Touch me
Till I feel your love on mine
Baby I swear I'll try
So I wish I could trade hearts with you
So I can feel the same way you do
You do
Cause there's some things you just don't understand
Like how hard a woman loves a man
Oh I wish I could trade hearts with you
With you
