Yeah

Searchin' ,searchin'
Searchin' the front
Finally found the one, it's you
It turn's me on when i wake up
You wearin' my shirt no makeup
You singin' real loud with me make love
Ooh woo hoo hoo
Only when tell all my partners
One smile, no words you saw them
Oh how your body sing's
Ooh woo hoo
No matter what you sing
You always sound sexy to me
That's when you know oh oh oh oh
You know oh oh oh oh
When your skin touches mine
I just wanna love you all night
That's when you know oh oh oh oh
You know oh oh oh oh
Oooo nothin'  (oooo nothin')
Nothin else matter's to me
Oooo no one  (oooo no one)
No one makes me feel this way
I've been

Finally found the one, it's you
I love it when you want to put
My chain on
Layin' in bed with the game on
Now i watch for long, here's the same song
Woo wooohoo
Ooo how you whisper when you got me
When you kiss every inch of my body
Your touchin' every tattoo
Like woo woohoo
No matter what you sing
You always sound sexy to me
That's when you know oh oh oh oh
You know oh oh oh oh
When your skin touches mine
I just wanna love you all night
That's when you know oh oh oh oh
You know oh oh oh oh
Oooo nothin'  (oooo nothin')
Nothin else matter's to me
Oooo no one  (oooo no one)
No one makes me feel this way
