<song artist="Jason_Derulo" title="Liquor_Love">
Put your arms around me
Head up on my shoulder
Give it to me baby
Can't get any closer
Let your body guide you
Your intoxicated
After all that grey goose
It's time to get naked
Girl
I know the room is spinning
That's only the beginning
Wait til' i get in it
Ooooooh girl
Get a little fithy
Drink a little with me
Best love is when you are tipsy
(chorus)
There's something bout that liquor love
(liquor love)
That liquor love
Can't get enough of liquor love (liquor love)
Of liquor love x5
Girl
I know the room is spinning
That's only the beginning
Wait til' i get in it
Ooooooh girl
Girl
I know the room is spinning
That's only the beginning
Wait til' i get in it
Ooooooh girl
Get a little filthy
Drink a with me
Best love is when you are tipsy
(chorus)
