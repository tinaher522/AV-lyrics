<song artist="Jason_Derulo" title="Bleed_Out">
This isn't...
This is... ooh
I love hard love
When you put, put a gun on my heart
I just gotta say hey
I just gotta say hey.
I've always loved hard
So i take it slow
I guess is my fault 'cause i wanna go
But i, always care for you
My... perfect not even close
But i don't deserve this
But girl i suppose
I wasn't there for you
Pre chorus:
... baby we're nothing else to say
Look me in my place i can't live out this way
Can't live out this way
Can't live out this way
You put it... in my heart
... start just a little... just a little...
Dance... i bleed.
2 x chorus:
When i bleed, i bleed out
When i cry, i cry loud
When i love...
When you leave i bleed out.
I look in those eyes
There's nothing there
I'm looking into
The cold is there
I, ever see
We haven't touched each other forever
Know what i do, if we're not together
I'm not ready to leave, no baby.
Pre chorus:
... baby we're nothing else to say
Look me in my place i can't live out this way
Can't live out this way
Can't live out this way
You put it... in my heart
... start just a little... just a little...
Dance... i bleed.
2 x chorus:
When i bleed, i bleed out
When i cry, i cry loud
When i love...
When you leave i bleed out.
Hey i look
Why you wanna out a gun in my heart
I just gotta say hey
I just gotta say hey
(chorus:)
