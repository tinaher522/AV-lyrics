<song artist="Pearl_Jam" title="Get_Right">
I want for to lay down
I'm waiting till sundown, uh
I'm searching the haystacks
Water is sunshine
Wait for the moment
The moment between us
The fire is made now
Harder to touch
I wanted to get right
I wanted to get right
I wanted to get right
With it, with you
Baker's dozen parades
Stand and debate
Out single file
Nine in a row
Swear if you must
Keeping your boots on
Float with the now
Hot to the touch
Concrete underground
Cast out everyday
Dregs of society
Underbelly
Inside of me
Rejoice and follow thee
I wanted to get right
I wanted to get right
I wanted to get right
With it, with you, woohoo
With you
I wanted to get right
I wanted to get right
I wanted to get right
I wanted to get right with
I wanted to get right
I wanted to get right
I wanted to get right
I wanted to get right
