<song artist="Pearl_Jam" title="Just_A_Girl">
Thieves in the window
Trouble down the hall
Florescent white ceiling
Blood, dripping, flows
Out on the front line
Preachers sweep the earth
Out on their backsides
With nothing in common, with no problem
She's just a girl...
Just...just a girl, yeah...
Just one time around
She has little chance to make good
Distance of her life
Decided in the woods
Burning fires
Feed her it, she believes
This maid in progress
Betrayin' your mother's need for a shelter
Your, just a girl
Just...just a girl
Just one time around
She had little chance to make good
Treats them now, she's young
But it can be taken away
Just one time around... it can be taken away
We all make mistakes
Hush my baby...don't you cry...
You're my little alibi
Oh please...I need some sleep
Hmm, I'll be taking
You with me
Just a girl  (5x)
Just a kid, yeah...
