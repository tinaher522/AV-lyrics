<song artist="Pearl_Jam" title="Johnny_Guitar">
Johnny Guitar Watson staring at me
Riding on 3 wheels, a woman on his knee
With a leg under a red dress I wish I could see
Further north a warmth alive and lingering
Now Johnny, he be having lots of women
The reason he be smiling known to him
On the left, the girl in red so innocent
Never sheds her clothes even when she goes to bed
Yeah, the type of girl responsible for original sin
Can't help but wonder where and who she is
And the memory is always getting clearer
For that's 30 years and more I've loved her so
And how I need to know why she's with him
And I sleep with the light on in case she comes
And I sleep with the light on in case she
Recently as I was waiting on a dream
She came to visit lost and lonely me
Oh, she leaned over the bed &amp; with her lips above my head
She asked if I had seen her Johnny
Oh and I hide my disappointment 
'Cause for years I have been hoping
Oh yeah, I had been hoping
That when she came, she would come for me
I hide my disappointment 'cause for years I had been hoping
That when she came, she'd be coming just for me
I'll hide my disappointment 'cause for years I have been hoping
That when she came she'd be coming just for me
