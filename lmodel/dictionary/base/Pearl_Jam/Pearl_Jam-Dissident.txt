<song artist="Pearl_Jam" title="Dissident">
She nursed him there over a night
I wasn't so sure she wanted him to stay
What to say? What to say?
But soon she was down, soon he was low
At a quarter past, a holy no
She had to turn around
When she couldn't hold, oh, she folded
A dissident is here
Escape is never the safest path
Oh, a dissident, a dissident is here
And to this day, she's glided on
Always home but so far away, like a word misplaced
Nothing said, what a waste
But when she had contact with the conflict
There was meaning but she sold him to the state
She had to turn around
When she couldn't hold, she folded 
A dissident is here
Escape is never the safest path 
Oh, a dissident, a dissident is here 
Oh, oh, oh...
She gave him away when she couldn't hold
No, she folded
A dissident is here
Escape is never the safest path
Oh, a dissident, a dissident is here
Oh, couldn't hold on
She couldn't hold, mo, she folded
A dissident is here
Escape is never the safest place
Oh, a dissident is here
