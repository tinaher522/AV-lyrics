<song artist="Pearl_Jam" title="Deep">
On the edge
Windowsill
Ponders his maker
Ponders his will
To the street below
He just ain't nothin'
But he's got a great view
And he sinks a needle deep
Can't touch the bottom
In too deep
Can't touch the bottom
On the edge of a
Know-nothing town
Feeling quite superior
The aged come
To the sky above
He just ain't nothin'
But he's got a great view
And he sinks a burning knife deep
Can't touch the bottom
In too deep, yeah
Uh-huh, can't touch the bottom
In too deep
On the edge of a
Christmas clean love
Young virgin from Heaven
Visiting
To the man above her
She just ain't nothing
But she doesn't like the view
She doesn't like the view
She doesn't like the view
But he sinks himself deep
Can't touch the bottom
In too deep, hey
Can't touch the bottom, can't touch the bottom
Deep
Can't, oh, touch the bottom
Can't, oh, touch the bottom
Can't, oh, touch the bottom
Can't, oh, touch the bottom
Can't, oh, touch the bottom
Can't, oh, touch the bottom, yeah
Oh
