<song artist="Pearl_Jam" title="Sweet_Lew">
power high, power low
you can take 'em all to school
you can fly, wilt the stilt had nothing on you
lambchops and afro-do, milwaukee bucks and a barbecue
#33 just like you
sweet lew, how could you?
sweet lew, makin' me blue
a laker trade their bobby-d for a house, a crew by the sea
a little help from 32, showtime, and worthy
those were the days, pre-investment spree
sweet lew, is it true?
sweet lew, how could you?
i grew up trying to copy you, bruce lee, and a kung-fu
acta jazzman, yogi too
little did i know, a loose screw
but you had your own shoe
build him high, build him tall, a taiku with a basketball
tear 'em down, one and all
7'2" is a long way to fall
sweet lew, how's the view?
sweet lew, how could you?
