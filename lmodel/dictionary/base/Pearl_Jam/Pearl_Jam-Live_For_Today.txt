<song artist="Pearl_Jam" title="Live_For_Today">
we had this bright idea one late summer night
candy-coated popcorn strung like a beaded curtain hung over your door
i guess the heat got to it, dripped and melted all over the floor
chocolate-covered cherries in tin foil boats float around the floorboard
i had to laugh not to cry
now all your possessions, all of your things, all of your hopes, schemes, desires, and most of all, your dreams
all gone away...gone away...
all gone away...gone away...
all gone away
"live for today", you said, "live for today"
i had to laugh not to cry
i had to laugh not to cry, not to cry...
