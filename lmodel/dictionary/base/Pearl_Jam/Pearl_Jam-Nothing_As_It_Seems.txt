<song artist="Pearl_Jam" title="Nothing_As_It_Seems">
Don't feel like home
He's a little out
And all these words alone
Is nothing like your poem
Putting in, inputting in
Don't feel like methadone
A scratching voice all alone
It's nothing like your baritone
It's nothing as it seems
The little that he needs, it's home
The little that he sees
Is nothing he can seize, it's home
One uninviting chromosome
A blanket like the ozone
It's nothing as it seems
All that he needs is home
The little that he frees
Is nothing he believes
Saving it for a sunny day
Something maybe, two tone
Anything of his own
A chip off the corner stone
Who's kidding? Rainy day
A one way ticket headstone
An occupation's overthrown
A whisper through a megaphone
It's nothing as it seems
The little that he needs, it's home
The little that he sees
Is nothing he concedes, it's home
And all that he frees
A little bittersweet, it's home
It's nothing as it seems
The little that he sees, it's home
