<song artist="Pearl_Jam" title="Daughter_-_It's_Ok">
Alone...
Listless...
Breakfast table in an otherwise empty room
Young girl...
Violin(ce)...
Center of her own attention
The mother reads aloud, child tries to understand it,
Tries to make her proud...
The shades go down, it's in her head
Painted room...
Can't deny there's something wrong.
Don't call me daughter, not fit to
The picture kept will remind me
Don't call me daughter, not fit to
The picture kept will remind me
Don't call me...
She holds the hand that holds her down
She will rise above
Don't call me daughter, not fit to
The picture kept will remind me
Don't call me daughter, not fit to be
The picture kept will remind me
Don't call me daughter, not fit to
The picture kept will remind me
Don't call me daughter, not fit to be
The picture kept will remind me
Don't call me...
The shades go down...
The shades go down...
The shades go...
Go...
Go... 
It’s ok
It’s ok
You don’t have to run and hide away
It’s ok
It’s  ok
We've all seen better days
It’s ok
It’s ok
We love you  anyway
This is our chance, this is our lives, 
This is our planet and  we're standing on
Use your my choice, use your voice 
You can save our tomorrow's now
This is our plea
This is our need
This is our time  of standing free
Let's make good
Let's see them grow
And the world  demanding on you
It’s ok
It’s ok
We've all seen better  days
It's ok
It’s ok
You can't run and hide away
It’s ok  
It’s ok
It's ok ...
It's Okaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay...
Oh  It's kayyyyy
