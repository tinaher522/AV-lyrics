<song artist="Pearl_Jam" title="Sympathy_For_The_Devil">
We the people, watch them grow
Feed the people, watch them grow
(Keep them alive I won't forget this night)
Please allow me to introduce myself
I'm a man of wealth and taste
I've been around for a long, long year
Stole many a man's soul and face
And I was 'round when Jesus Christ
Had his moment of doubt and pain
Made damn sure that Pilate
Washed his hand and sealed his fate
