<song artist="Pearl_Jam" title="Untitled">
got a car, got some gas,
lets get out of here, get out of here fast,
oh everyone's confused, so I stay in my room,
if I go...I don't want... to go...alone...
I hope you get this message, or you're not home
I could be there in ten mintues or so,
oh I got my things, we'll make it up as we go along,
oh with you I could never be alone,
never....be....alone
