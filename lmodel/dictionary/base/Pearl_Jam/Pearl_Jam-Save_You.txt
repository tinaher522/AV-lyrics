<song artist="Pearl_Jam" title="Save_You">
I'm gonna save you fucker, not gonna lose you
Feeling cocky and strong, can't let you go
Too important to me
Too important to us, we'd be lost without you
Baby, let yourself fall, I'm right below you now
And fuck me if I say something you don't wanna hear, fuck me
And fuck me if you only hear what you wanna hear
Fuck me if I care, but I'm not leaving here
You helped me when I was down, I'll help you when you're down
Why are you hitting yourself? C'mon, hit me instead
Let's pick up your will, it's grown fat and lazy
I'm sympathetic as well, don't go on me now
And I'm not living this life without you, I'm selfish and clear, clear
And you're not leaving here without me, I don't wanna be without
My best friend, wake up
To see you could have it all, all, wooh
'Cause there is but you and something within you
It's taken control, let's beat it, get up, let's go
Oh you're in your own world, let's see the whole world
Let's pick up your soul
And fuck me if I say something you don't wanna hear, fuck me
Fuck me
And fuck me if you only hear the trouble in your head
Please help me to help you help yourself
Help me help yourself
Please want me to, please let me to
Help you
