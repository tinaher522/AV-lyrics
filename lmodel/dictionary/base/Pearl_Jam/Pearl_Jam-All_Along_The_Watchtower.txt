<song artist="Pearl_Jam" title="All_Along_The_Watchtower">
There must be some kind of way out of here
Said the joker to the thief
There's too much confusion
I can't get no relief
Businessmen they drink my wine
Plow men dig my earth
None will level on the line
Nobody of it is worth
Hey Hey
No reason to get excited
The thief he kindly spoke
There are many here among us
Who feel that life is but a fucking joke but, uh
But you and I we've been through that
And this is not our fate
So let us not talk falsely now
The hour's getting late
Hey 
Hey
All along the watchtower
Princes kept the view
While all the women came and went
Bare-foot servants to, but, Uh
Outside in the cold distance
A wild cat did growl
Two riders were approaching
And the wind began to howl
Hey
Oh
All along the watchtower
Hear you sing around the watch
Gotta beware gotta beware I will
Yeah
Ooh baby
All along the watchtower
