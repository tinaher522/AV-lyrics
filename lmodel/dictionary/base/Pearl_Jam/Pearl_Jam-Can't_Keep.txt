<song artist="Pearl_Jam" title="Can't_Keep">
I wanna shake
I wanna wind out
I wanna leave
This mind and shout
I've lived
All this life
Like an ocean
In disguise
I don't live forever
You can't keep me here
I wanna race
With the sundown
I want a last breath
I don't let out
Forgive
Every being
The bad feelings
It's just me
I won't wait for answers
You can't keep me here
I wanna rise
And say goodnight
I Wanna take
A look on the other side
I've lived
All this life
It's been wonder
Full at night
I will live for ever
You can't keep me here
