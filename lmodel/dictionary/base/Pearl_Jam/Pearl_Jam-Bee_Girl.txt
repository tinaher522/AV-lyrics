<song artist="Pearl_Jam" title="Bee_Girl">
bee girl
you're gonna die
you don't wanna be famous
you wanna be shy
do your dances
alone in your room
becoming a star
will become your doom
bee girl, be a girl
bee girl, be a girl
you know time is long
and life is short
begin to live
while you still can
believe in nothing
believe me
those who can be trusted
can change their mind
the anxious
is the present
unwrap your gifts
take your time
everything you imagined
needn't be stuck in your mind
bee girl, be a girl
bee girl, be a girl
thank you
