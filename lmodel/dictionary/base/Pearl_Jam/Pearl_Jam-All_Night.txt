<song artist="Pearl_Jam" title="All_Night">
got all night
plenty of time
take these chains
from my eyes
so alive
getting pride
take her down
before you die
right be satisfied
we've got all night
is he here
top of the stairs
no place for
the president
build some fears
slip outside
fuck, be content
to just get by
why be satisfied
we've got all night
ahhh
scream and wail
see who cares
scream and wail
see who cares
life has nothin' to do with
killin' time
oh well
right, be satisfied
we've got
all night
we've got all night
we've got all night
