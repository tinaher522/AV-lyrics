<song artist="Pearl_Jam" title="Unemployable">
He's got a big gold ring which says "Jesus Saves"
And it's dented from the punch thrown at work that day
When he smashed the metal locker where he kept his things
After the big boss say, "You best be on your way"
So this life is sacrifice
Oh yeah
Jumping trains just to survive
Well his wife and kid's asleep but he's still awake
And his brain weighs the curse of thirty bills unpaid
Gets up, lights a cigarette he's grown to hate
Thinking if he can't sleep, how will he ever dream again?
So this life is sacrificed
Oh yeah
To a stranger's bottom line
Oh yeah
I've seen the light, oho oh oh oho oh oh
I'm scared alive
Nearly dead
Oho oh oh oho oh ohh
I've seen the light
Still alive
Yeah
So this life is sacrificed
Oh yeah
Was a dream that had to die
Oh yeah
I've seen the light, oho oh oh oho oh oh
I'm scared alive
Near to death
Oho oh oh oho oh oh
I've seen the light
Scared alive
Oho ohhh ohhhhh oooohoooo
I'm here to die
Here to die
Scared alive
Here to die
Here to die
Scared of life
