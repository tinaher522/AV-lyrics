<song artist="Pearl_Jam" title="Save_It_For_Later">
Two dozen other dirty
Oh, don't wanna be a sucker for it
Don't mean to cry to my mother
Ma, just let me come, let me come to a decision on it
Sooner or later 
You'll hit the deck, you'll get found out
Save it for later 
Don't run away, don't let me down
Save it for later 
You'll hit the deck, you'll get found out
Save it for later 
Don't run away, don't run away, don't let me down
Don't run away, don't run away, don't let me down
Don't run away, don't run away, don't let me down
Don't run away, don't run away, don't run away, don't run away
Don't run away, don't run away, don't run away, don't run away
Don't run away, don't run away, don't run away
Run away, run away, run away, run away, run away, run away, run away 
Run away, run away, run away, run away, run away, run away, run away 
Run away, run away, run away, run away, run away, run away, run away
Run away, run away, run away, run away, run away, run away
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
