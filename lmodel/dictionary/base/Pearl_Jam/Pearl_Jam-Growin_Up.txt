<song artist="Pearl_Jam" title="Growin_Up">
Well I stood stone-like at midnight
Suspended in my masquerade
I combed my hair 'til it was just right 
And commanded the night brigade
I was open to pain 
And crossed by the rain 
And I walked with a crooked crutch
I strolled all alone 
Through the fallout zone 
Came out with my soul untouched
I stood in the crowd and read something loud
But when they said, "Put out," I stood up
Ooh-ooh, growin' up
The flag of piracy flew from my mast
My sails were set wing to wing
I had a jukebox graduate for a first mate
She couldn't sail but she sure could sing
And I pushed B-52 
And bombed 'em with the blues 
With my gear set stubborn on standing
I strolled all alone 
Through the fallout zone
Never once gave thought to landing
I stood in the crowd and read something loud
But when they said, "Put down," I put up
Ooh-ooh, growin' up
I stood in the crowded warmth of the crowd
But when they said, "Sit down," I threw up
Ooh-ooh...
Ooh-ooh, growin' up
Ooh-ooh, growin' up, yeah
