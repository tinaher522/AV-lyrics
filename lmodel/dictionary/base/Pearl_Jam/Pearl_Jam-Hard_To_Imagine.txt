Hard to Imagine
Paint a picture, using only gray
Light your pillow, lay back, watch the flames
I tell a story, no one listen that long
It's hard to imagine, it's hard to imagine...
Ooh... (3x)
Tear into yourself cuttings on your arm
Heart-a-beatin', tickin' like a bomb
After having seen all that they saw
It's hard to imagine, it's hard to imagine...
Ooh... (3x)
Oh...
Things were different then, all is different now } (2x)
I tried to explain, somehow... }
Ooh... oh... (4x)
Ohh...
Things were different then, all is different now
OBI tried to explain, I hope this works somehow...
Things were different then, all is different now
I tried to explain, oh, somehow...
Ooh... oh... (4x)
