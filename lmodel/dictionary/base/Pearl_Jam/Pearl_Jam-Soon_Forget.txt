<song artist="Pearl_Jam" title="Soon_Forget">
Sorry is the fool who trades his soul for a Corvette
Thinks he'll get the girl he'll only get the mechanic
What's missing?
He's living a day he'll soon forget
That's one more time around, the sun is going down
The moon is out but he's drunk and shouting
Putting people down, he's pissing
He's living a day he'll soon forget
Counts his money every morning
The only thing that keeps him horny
Locked in a giant house that's alarming
The townsfolk they all laugh
Sorry is the fool who trades his love for high rise rent
Seem the more you make equals the loneliness you get
And it's fitting
He's barely living a day he'll soon forget
That's one more time around and there is not a sound
He's lying dead clutching Benjamins
Never put the money down, he's stiffening
We're all whistling a man we'll soon forget
