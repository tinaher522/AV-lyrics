<song artist="Pearl_Jam" title="Blue_Red_And_Grey">
Some people seem so obsessed with the mornin'
Get up early just to watch the sun rise
Other people like it more when there's fire in the sky
Worship the sun when it's high
Some people go for those sultry evenings
Cocktails in the blue, red and grey
But I like every minute of the day
I dig every second
As long as you are on my mind
Each precious moment has it's special charm
It's all right when you're around, rain or shine
Some people seem to only live after midnight
That has faces always seem so pale
And [Incomprehensible] who must have sunlight
They say a sun tan never fails
I was a man who worked the night shifts
I was lucky to get a job and some pay
Now I like every minute of the day
I dig every second
I can laugh in the snow and rain
I get a buzz from being cold and wet
The pleasure seems to balance out the pain
And so you see that I'm completely crazy
I even shun the south of France
The people on my hill, they say I'm lazy
But when they sleep, I sing and dance
Some people go for those sultry evenings
Cocktails in the blue, red and grey
But I like every minute of the day
I like every minute of the day
