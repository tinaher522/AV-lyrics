<song artist="Pearl_Jam" title="Man_Of_The_Hour">
Tidal waves don't beg forgiveness, crashed and on their way
Father he enjoyed collisions, others walked away
A snowflake falls in may
And the doors are open now as the bells are ringing out
'Cause the man of the hour is taking his final bow, goodbye for now
Nature has its own religion, gospel from the land
Father ruled by long division, young men they pretend
Old men comprehend.
And the sky breaks at dawn, shedding light upon this town, they'll all come 'round
Cause the man of the hour is taking his final bow, goodye for now
And the road the old man paved
The broken seams along the way
The rusted signs, left just for me
He was guiding me, Love, his own way
Now the man of the hour is taking his final bow
As the curtain comes down I feel that this is just goodbye for now
