<song artist="Pearl_Jam" title="Force_Of_Nature">
Understand she's a force of nature
Contraband hiding deep inside her soul
Exorcising her will to lose control
She lets go
A common man, he don't stand a chance, no
Wonderland pulling Alice in the hole
No way to save someone who won't take the rope
And just lets go
One man stands the edge of the ocean
A beacon on dry land
Eyes upon the horizon
In the dark before the dawn
Hurricane has the trade winds blowing
A gale force shaking windows in the storm
Shipwreck on the rock that he calls home
With one light on
Somewhere there's a siren singing
A song only he hears
All the strength you might think
Would disappear resolving
One man stands alone, awaiting
For her to come home
Eyes upon the horizon
In dark before the darkness meets the dawn
Makes me ache
Makes me shake
Is it so wrong to think that love can keep us safe?
Last I saw, he was out there waiting
A silhouette in the black light, full moon glow
In the sand there he stands upon the shore
Forevermore
Somewhere there's a siren singing
A song only he hears
All the strength that you might think
Would disappear, resolving
One man stands alone, awaiting
For her to come home
Eyes are closed, you cannot know
But his heart don't seem to roam
Oh, oh
