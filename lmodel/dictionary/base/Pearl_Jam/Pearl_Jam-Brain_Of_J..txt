<song artist="Pearl_Jam" title="Brain_Of_J.">
1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4
Who's got the brain of JFK?
What's it mean to us now, yeah?
Pause, it sounds distrust
But I can tell ya, this is no lie
The whole world will be different soon
The whole world will be relieved
The whole world will be different soon
The whole world will be relieved
You, you've been taught, whipped into shape
Now they've got you in line, eh
Stand behind the stripes
There will be order, so give up your mind
The whole world will be different soon
The whole world will be relieved
The whole world will be different soon
The whole world will be relieved
Lend my name
The name they gave me
The name I'm letting go
The whole world will be different soon
The whole world will be relieved
The whole world will be different soon
The whole world will be relieved
The whole world will be different soon
The whole world will be relieved
The whole world will be different
Soon
