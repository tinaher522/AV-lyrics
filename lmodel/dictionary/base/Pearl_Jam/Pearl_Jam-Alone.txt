<song artist="Pearl_Jam" title="Alone">
Mmm, wide awake and he shakes in a panic
Never woke up alone ever before
Had his woman long as he can remember
Tries to forget, but he can't, he can't
Out of bed and he dreams in the shower
She's standing naked, he's apologizing
Reaches for her till his mind becomes blood hot
Woken up to be burned, burned again
Go it alone
You got it, so it goes
Got his knees to his face
He can't take it any other way
On the street he's walking wounded
Doesn't smile for the child at play
Thoughts of suicide and alleviation
Anything to get his heart off of the coals
Does he fly away or just talk about it?
Like a seagull born to cry in the wind
Own experiences lead to a younger
All alone, you will meet the one who lies in wait
Go it alone
You got it so it goes
Try to breathe, but he can't
He can't take it for another day, yeah yeah
I can help myself, don't talk to me
I can help myself, don't talk to me
I can help myself, myself
I can help myself, don't talk to me
I can help myself, don't talk to me
I can help myself, don't talk to me
I can help myself, myself
I can help myself, don't talk to me
I can help myself
Wide awake and he shakes in a panic
Never woke up alone ever before
Had his woman long as he can remember
Tries to forget, but he can't, he can't
