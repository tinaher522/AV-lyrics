<song artist="Pearl_Jam" title="Undone">
Last stop on the westcoast line
South of the northern border
One small corner on my mind
Everybody they know me there
Don't get any second glances
Chances are that they don't care
World as come undone
Like they change it everyday
Change don't come at once
There's a wave building before it breaks
Can't wait for election day
Where the nasty occupation
Corporations rule the day
Playing on the pendulum throws
Farther out to the one side swinging
Has to sweep back the other way
The world has come undone
Another day and who can wait
Change don't come at once
It's a wave building before it breaks
All this hope and nowhere to go
This is how I used to feel but no more
The world has come undone
Like a game that few can play
Change don't come from one
It's a wave building before it breaks
