<song artist="Pearl_Jam" title="In_My_Tree">
Up here in my tree, yeah.
Newspapers matter not to me, yeah.
No more crowbars to my head, yeah.
I'm trading stories with the leaves instead, yeah.
Wave to all my friends, yeah.
They don't seem to notice me, no.
All their eyes trained on the street, yo, oh.
Sidewalks, cigarettes, and scenes... tempted.
Up here so high I start to shake.
Up here so high the sky I scrape. 
I'm so high I hold just one breath here within my chest, just like innocence.
Eddie's down in his home.
Oh, the blue sky, it's his home.
Eddie's blue sky home.
Oh, the blue sky, it's his home.
I remember when, yeah,
I swore I knew everything, oh yeah.
Let's say knowledge is a tree, yeah.
It's growing up just like me, yeah.
I'm so light, the wind he shakes.
I'm so high, the sky I scrape.
I'm so light I hold just one breath and go back to my nest, sleep with innocence.
Up here so high, the boughs they break.
Up here so high, the sky I scrape.
Had my eyes peeled both wide open,
And I got a glimpse of my innocence.
Got back my inner sense.
Baby, got it, still got it.
