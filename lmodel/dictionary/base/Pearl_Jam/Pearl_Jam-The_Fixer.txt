<song artist="Pearl_Jam" title="The_Fixer">
When something's dark, let me shed a little light on it
When something's cold, let me put a little fire on it
If something's old, I want to put a bit of shine on it
When something's gone, I want to fight to get it back again
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Fight to get it back again
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
When something's broke, I want to put a bit of fixing on it
When something's bored, I want to put a little excited on it
If something's low, I want to put a little high on it
When something's lost, I want to fight to get it back again
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Fight to get it back again
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
When signals cross, I want to put a little straight on it
If there's no love, I want to try to love again
I’ll say your prayers, I’ll take your side
I'll find us a way to make light
I'll dig your grave, we'll dance and sing
What say, could be our last lifetime
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Uh, uh, uh, uh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Fight to get it back again
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Fight to get it back again
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Fight to get it back again
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
