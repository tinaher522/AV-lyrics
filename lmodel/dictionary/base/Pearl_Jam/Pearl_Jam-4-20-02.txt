<song artist="Pearl_Jam" title="4-20-02">
So all you fools
Who sing just like him
Feel free to do so now
Cuz he's dead
Using, using, using
The using takes toll
Isolation
Just so happy to be one
Sad to, sad to think
Sad to think of him more
Lonesome friend, we all knew
Always hoped you'd pull through
No blame, no blame
No blame, it could be you
Using, you can't grow old using
So sing just like him, fuckers
It won't offend him
Just me
Because he's dead
