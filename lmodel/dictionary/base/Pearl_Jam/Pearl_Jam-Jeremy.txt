<song artist="Pearl_Jam" title="Jeremy">
At home, drawing pictures
Of mountaintops
With him on top
Lemon yellow sun
Arms raised in a V
And the dead lay 
In pools of maroon below
 
Daddy didn't give attention
Oh, to the fact
That mommy didn't care
King Jeremy the Wicked
Oh, ruled his world
 
Jeremy spoke in class today
Jeremy spoke in class today
 
Clearly I remember
Picking on the boy
Seemed a harmless little fuck
Oh, but we unleashed a lion
Gnashed his teeth and bit the recess lady's breast
How could I forget?
And he hit me with a surprise left
My jaw left hurting
Oooh, dropped wide open
Just like the day
Oh, like the day I heard
 
Daddy didn't give affection, no
And the boy was something
That mommy wouldn't wear
King Jeremy the wicked
Oh, ruled his world
 
Jeremy spoke in class today
Jeremy spoke in class today
Jeremy spoke in class today
 
Whoa
Whoa
Whoa
Whoa
Whoa
Whoa
Whoa
Whoa
Whoa
Whoa
Whoa
Whoa
Whoa
Whoa
Whoa
 
Try to forget this
(Try to forget this)
Try to erase this
(Try to erase this)
From the blackboard
 
Jeremy spoke in class today
Jeremy spoke in class today
Jeremy spoke in, spoke in
Jeremy spoke in, spoke in
Jeremy spoke in class today
