<song artist="Pearl_Jam" title="Why_Go">
She scratches a letter
Into a wall
Made of stone
Maybe someday another child 
Won't feel as alone as she does
It's been two years and counting 
Since they put her in this place
She's been diagnosed 
By some stupid fuck
And mommy agrees, yeah
Why go home?
Why go home?
Why go home?
She seems to be stronger
But what they want
Her to be is weak
She could play pretend
She could join the game, boy
She could be another clone
Oh
Uh
Ah, yeah
Why go home?
Why go home?
Why go home?
Why go home?
What you taught me (Why go home?) 
Put me here (Why go home?) 
Don't come visit (Why go home?)
Mother, sing it
Why go home?
Why go home?
Why go home?
Why go home?
What you taught me (Why go home?) 
Put me here (Why go home?) 
Don't come visit (Why go home?)
Mother, Mother, yeah (Why go home?)
(Why go home?)
(Why go home?)
(Why go home?)
(Why go home?)
(Why go home?)
(Why go home?)
