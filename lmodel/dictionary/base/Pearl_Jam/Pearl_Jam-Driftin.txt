Driftin
Driftin away
I got myself a mansion
And I gave it away
It's not the world that's heavy
It's just the friends that you save
But I'm driftin
Driftin away
Driftin
Driftin
Driftin along
I rid myself of worries
And the worries were gone
I can run when I want to
And I sleep like a dog
I'm just driftin
Driftin along
The suit-coats say
There is money to be made
They get so damn excited
But I guess it's their way
My road it may be lonely
Just because it's not paved
It's good for driftin
Driftin away
Aw the suit-coats say
There is money to be made
They get so damn excited
Nothing gets in their way
My road it may be lonely
Just because it's not paved
It's good for driftin
Driftin away
Driftin
Driftin
Driftin uh-huh
I feel like going back there
But never for long
I sometimes wonder if they know that I'm gone
I'm just driftin
Driftin along
Driftin
Driftin along
Driftin
Driftin
