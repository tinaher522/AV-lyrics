<song artist="Pearl_Jam" title="Black,_Red,_Yellow">
Exponentially serving. Perpetually unnerving. Vehicle swerving.
The adjectives they are all a-blurring.
Freud walking the sidelines clipboard scoring the brain.
Black magic painted traits. Makes me sane.
Hormones firing like a fifty foot Roman, yeah.
Please don't make me explain. Don't matter anyway.
Phantom pain in my brain. It's all that's left of my leg.
Black and Red and Yellow and Black and Red and Yellow.
Heard you repeat a-what ya heard. Me knowing the truth I can not concur. Na-na.
Hormones firing like a fifty foot Roman, yeah.
Please don't make me explain. Doesn't matter anyway.
Hormones firing like a fifty foot Roman, yeah.
Please don't make me explain.
Yo bro. Tell us what's happenin'. Um, I'm on the west, west side of, on the west coast.
Give me a jingle, uh, when you get in from where the fuck you're at.
Yeah, hormones firing like a fifty foot Roman, yeah.
Please don't make me explain. Doesn't fucking matter anyway.
Hormones firing like a fifty foot Roman, yeah. Please don't make me explain.
