<song artist="Pearl_Jam" title="Cropduster">
Light green to green, dark green, brown
Every life is falling down
Brown to black, it's coming back
Dies to be part of the ground
Seed to seedling, root to stem
Eyes, no eyes, there's no difference
Every life is looking in
Swallowing seeds on the deathbed
Dig a hole in the garden
Everyone is practicing
But this world's an accident
I was the fool because I thought
I thought the world
Turns out the world thought me
It's all the other way around
We're upside down
Dad, he's gone up in flames
But this ain't no movie
This ain't no book you can close
When the big lie hits your eye
Everyone is practicing
Our world's an accident
I was the fool because I thought
I thought the world
Turns out the world thought me
It's all the other way 'round
We're upside down
Down, down, down
Let the fluency set it down 
Down
Let the fluency set it down
There's an upside of down
The moon is rolling 'round our world
The moon is rolling 'round our world
Our world
Our world
