<song artist="Pearl_Jam" title="Last_Kiss">
Oh where oh where, can my baby be
The Lord took her, away from me
She's gone to heaven, so I've got to be good
So I can see my baby when I leave this world
We were out on a date in my daddy's car
We hadn't driven very far
There in the road, straight ahead
A car was stalled, the engine was dead
I couldn't stop, so I swerved to the right
I'll never forget, the sound that night
The screamin' tires, the bustin' glass
The painful scream that I, heard last
Oh where oh where, can my baby be
The Lord took her, away from me
She's gone to heaven, so I've got to be good
So I can see my baby when I leave, this world
When I woke up, the rain was pourin' down
There were people, standin' all around
Somethin' warm, flowin' through my eyes
But somehow, I found my baby that night
I lifted her head, she looked at me and said
Hold me darlin', for a little while
I held her close, I kissed her our last kiss
I found the love, that I knew I had missed
Well now she's gone, even though I hold her tight
I lost my love my life, that night
Oh where oh where, can my baby be
The Lord took her, away from me
She's gone to heaven, so I've got to be good
So I can see my baby when I leave, this world
Ooh ooh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh ooh ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh ooh ooh-ooh-ooh
Oh oh oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh oh oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh uh
