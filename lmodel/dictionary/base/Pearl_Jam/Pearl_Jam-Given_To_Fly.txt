<song artist="Pearl_Jam" title="Given_To_Fly">
He could have tuned in, tuned in, but he tuned out
A bad time, nothing could save him
Alone in a corridor waiting locked out
He got up out of there, ran for hundreds of miles
He made it to the ocean, had a smoke in a tree
The wind rose up, set him down on his knee
Wave came crashing like a fist to the jaw,
Delivered him wings, "Hey, look at me now..."
Arms wide open with the sea as his floor
Oh â€“ ah, ohhh...
He's - flying! Home
High! Wide! Home...
He floated back down 'cause he wanted to share
His key to the locks on the chains, he saw everywhere
But first he was stripped, then he was stabbed
By faceless men, well...fuckers, he still stands.
And he still gives his love, he just gives it away
The love he receives is the love that is saved
And sometimes is seen a strange spot in the sky
A human being that was given to fly
Flying! Home...
High! Flying! Home...
He's Flying! Home...
Ohh, oahh...Home...
