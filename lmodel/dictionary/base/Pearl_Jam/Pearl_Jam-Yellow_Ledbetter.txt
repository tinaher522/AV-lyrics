<song artist="Pearl_Jam" title="Yellow_Ledbetter">
Unsealed, on a porch a letter sat
Then you said, "I wanna leave it again."
Once I saw her on a beach of weathered sand
And on the sand
I wanna leave it again... yeah
On a weekend... wanna wish it all away, yeah
And they called, and I said that "I want what I said" and then I call out again
And the reason, oughtta leave her calm, I know
I said, "I don't know whether I'm the boxer or the bag."
(Alternate opening verse:
I want to see that...
On a voice that let out said
"Let me see him."
I want to leave it {him} again
Once I saw him on a beach of weathered sand
I don't want to see him
I want to leave it {him} again
I want to leave here, I want to get wasted on the way, yeah
And he called and I said and I know what I said and I called out again
And the reason, I'm gonna' leave her {him} gone, but I know
What I said, "I don't know whether to leave it in the box there or n'the bag.")
"Ah yeah... Can you see them out on the porch?
Yeah, but they don't wave
But I see them... 'round different ways, yeah
And I know, and I know... I don't want to stay
Ah yeah, yeah
Can you see them
Out on the porch?
Yeah, but they don't wave
I see them... 'round the front way, yeah
And I know, and I know
I don't want to stay
(Make me cry)
Ooooh I see
Ooh, I dont know there's something else
I want to drum it all away
Oh, I said, "I--I don't, I don't know whether I was the box or the bag."
Ah yeah
Can you see them
Out on the porch?
Yeah, but they don't wave
But, I see them round the front way, yeah
And I know, and I know...{that I don't...}
I don't want to stay, alone {at all}
I don't wanna stay, yeah
I don't wanna stay
I don't wanna stay
I don't
Don't wanna
Ohhhh
Yeah... oooh no no no no no
Ohhhhhhh oh oh oh oh
