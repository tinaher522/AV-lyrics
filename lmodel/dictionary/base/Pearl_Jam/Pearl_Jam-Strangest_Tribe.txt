<song artist="Pearl_Jam" title="Strangest_Tribe">
It's five below in evidence.
The winded eves and sideways snow.
His eminence has yet to show.
Follow the ageless tide.
Follow the angled light.
Follow the strangest tribe.
It's 6:00 AM. You're waiting for...
You've had your feast. 
You're wanting more.
Follow the wayward mile.
Follow the distant high.
Follow the strangest tribe.
Follow the ancient stripe.
Follow the angels try.
Follow the strangest tribe.
