<song artist="Pearl_Jam" title="Hail,_Hail">
Ah, is there room for both of us? Both of us apart?
Are we bound out of obligation? Is that all we've got? 
I get the words and then I get to thinking
I don't wanna think, I wanna feel
How do I feel? How do I? 
If you're the only one, will I never be enough, yeah
Hail, hail the lucky ones
I refer to those in love, yeah
Oh, how I'd love you till the day I die... and beyond
Are we going to the same place? If so, can I come? 
It's egg rolling, thick and heavy
All the past we carry
Oh, I could be new
You under-estimate me
If you're the only one, will I never be enough, yeah
Hail, hail the lucky ones
I refer to those in love, yeah
I sometimes realize I could only be as good as you'll let me
Are you woman enough to be my man? 
Bandaged hand in hand
Black lining
On the run in a race that can't be won, yeah
Oh, hail, hail the lucky ones
I refer to those in love, yeah
If you're my only one
So good, you, only one
I want to be your one
Enough, you won, your one, your one
