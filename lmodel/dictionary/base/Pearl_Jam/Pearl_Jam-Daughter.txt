<song artist="Pearl_Jam" title="Daughter">
Alone
Listless
Breakfast table in an otherwise empty room
A young girl
Violins
Center of her own attention, the
Mother reads aloud, child tries to understand it
Tries to make her proud
The shades go down, it's in her head
Painted room
Can't deny there's something wrong
Don't call me daughter, not fit to
The picture kept will remind me
Don't call me daughter, not fit to
The picture kept will remind me
Don't call me
She holds the hand that holds her down
She will rise above
Ah
Don't call me daughter, not fit to
The picture kept will remind me
Don't call me daughter, not fit to be
The picture kept will remind me
Don't call me daughter, not fit to
The picture kept will remind me
Don't call me daughter, not fit to be
The picture kept will remind me
Don't call me
The shades go down
The shades go down
The shades go
Go
Go
