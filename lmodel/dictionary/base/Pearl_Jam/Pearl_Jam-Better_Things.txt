<song artist="Pearl_Jam" title="Better_Things">
Here's wishin' you the bluest sky
And hopin' somethin' better comes tomorrow
Hopin' all the verses rhyme and the very best of choruses to
Follow all the doubt and sadness
I know that better things are on the way
Here's hopin' all the days ahead
Won't be as bitter as the ones behind you
Be an optimist instead and somehow happiness will find you
Forget what happened yesterday
I know that better things are on the way
It's really good to see you rockin' out and havin' fun
Livin' like you just begun, accept your life and what it brings
I hope tomorrow you'll find better things
I know tomorrow you'll find better things
Here's wishin' you the bluest sky
And hopin' somethin' better comes tomorrow
Hopin' all the verses rhyme and the very best of choruses to
Follow all the drudge and sadness
I know that better things are on the way
I know you've got a lot of good things happenin' up ahead
The past is gone it's all been said, here's to what the future brings
I know tomorrow you'll find better things
I know tomorrow you'll find better things
I hope tomorrow you'll find better things
I know tomorrow you'll find better things
I hope tomorrow you'll find better things
