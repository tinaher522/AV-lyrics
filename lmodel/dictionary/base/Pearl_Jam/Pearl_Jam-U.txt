<song artist="Pearl_Jam" title="U">
Thought it was easy to fall in love but you, you, you.
You're different this much I know yeah, you, you, you.
It might be your guile. It could be your mind.
It might be the way you take your time.
Oh, you, you, you.
You, it's you. It's you, you, you.
Oh, you. It's you. It's you, you, you.
I never know how much to say with you, you, you.
I like to go deep but is it safe with you, you, you.
It might be your needs. It could be your eyes.
It might be the way you sympathize.
Oh, you, you, you.
You. It's you. It's you, you, you.
Oh, you. It's you. It's you you you
You break laws and pay no fines. You get yours and then get mine.
I don't think it's easy to stay in love.
But you, you, you, you.
But you, yes you. It's you, you, you.
You. it's you. it's you, you, you.
Ah you
It's you. [x3]
Ah you, you, you, yes you.
With you, you, you, you ah.
