<song artist="Pearl_Jam" title="Sad">
All the photographs are peeling 
And colors turned to gray, he stayed 
In his room with memories for days, he faced
An undertow of futures laid to waste, embraced 
By the loss of one he could not replace
And there's no reason that she passed
And there is no god with a plan, it's sad 
And his holiness is proof, it's sad 
He could only love you, it's sad
The door swings to a passing fable 
A fate we may delay, we say
Holding on, to live within our embrace
Eleven nights he laid in bed
Hoping that dreams will bring her back, it's sad 
And his loneliness is proof, it's sad 
He could only love you, it's sad 
Holding his last breath, believing 
He'll make his way 
But she's not forgotten
He's haunted 
He's searching for escape 
If just one wish could bring her back, it's sent
And his holiness is proof, it's sad 
He will always love you, it's sad
