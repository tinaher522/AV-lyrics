<song artist="Pearl_Jam" title="Throw_Your_Arms_Around_Me">
I will come to you in the daytime
I will raise you from your sleep
I will kiss you in four places
As I go runnin' down your street
I will squeeze the life right out of you
I will make you laugh, and make you cry
And we may never forget it
As I make you call my name as you shout it to the blue, summer sky
And we may never meet again
So shed your skin lets get started
And you will throw your arms around me
And you will throw your arms around me
I will come to you at nightime
I will climb into your bed
I will kiss you in 155 places
As I go swim around in your head
I will squeeze the life right out of you
I will make you laugh, I'll make you cry
And we may never forget it
As I make you call my name as you shout it to the blue, summer sky
And we may never meet again
So shed your skin lets get started
And you will throw your arms around me
And you will throw your arms around me
Ohh yeah, uh huh, uh huh...
Ohh yeah, uh hum, ooh...
Ohh yeah, uh huh, uh huh...
Oh...and you will throw your arms around me...
