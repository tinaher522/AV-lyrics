<song artist="Pearl_Jam" title="Better_Man_-_Save_It_For_Later">
Waitin', watchin' the clock, it's four o' clock, it's got to stop.
Tell him, take no more, she practices her speech.
As he opens the door, she rolls over, pretends to sleep as he looks her over.
She lies and says she's in love with him.
Can't find a better man.
She dreams in color, she dreams in red.
Can't find a better man.
Can't find a better man.
Can't find a better man.
Ohh...
Talkin' to herself, there's no one else who needs to know...
She tells herself, oh...
Memories back when she was smooth and strong, and waiting for the world to come along.
Swears she knew it, now she swears he's gone.
and she swears he's cool.
She lies and says she's in love with him.
Can't find a better man.
She dreams in color, she dreams in red.
Can't find a better man.
She lies and says she still loves him.
Can't find a better man.
She dreams in color, she dreams in red.
Can't find a better man.
Can't find a better man.
Can't find a better man.
Can't find a better man.
Yeah...
She loved him, yeah...
She don't want to leave this way.
She feeds him, yeah...
That's why she'll be back again.
Can't find a better man.
Can't find a better man.
Can't find a better man.
Can't find a better man.
Can't find a better...man... 
Two dozen other dirty lovers
Must be a sucker for it
Don't need to cry my mother
Just let me come come to a decision on
Sooner or later you hit the deck you get found out
Save it for later don't run away and let me down.
Sooner or later you hit the deck you get found out
Save it for later don't run away, don't run away and let me down.
I know I've fucked up
I know We've fucked up
But please don't, dont' leave me now
Don't leave me now, don't run away,don't run away,don't run away,don't run away, run away...runawayrunawayrunaway
DONT'T LET ME DOWN!
