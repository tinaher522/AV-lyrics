<song artist="Pearl_Jam" title="Gonna_See_My_Friend">
Do you wanna hear something sick?
We are but victims of desire
I'm gonna shake this thing
I wanna shake this pain before I retire
I'm gonna see my friend, I'm gonna see my friend 
Make it go away
I'm sick of everything, I'm gonna see my friend 
make it go away
Buona sera, won't be long before we 
All walk off the wire
I'm gonna see my friend, I'm gonna see my friend 
For what I require
Buona sera, cut my quick
Don't want my flame to get no higher
I'm gonna see my friend, I'm gonna see my friend
Make it go away
I'm sick of everything, I'm gonna see my friend
Make it go away
I'm gonna see my friend, I'm gonna see my friend
Make it go away
Wanna leave it all
Wanna give it up
Wanna see it, gone once and for all
Wanna feel withdrawal
Want an overhaul
Wanna be there, hard as a statue
Black as a tattoo, never to wash away
Gonna take me an astral plane
I'm gonna tunnel through denial
I'm gonna shake this thing
I wanna shake this pain 'fore I retire
I'm gonna see my friend, I'm gonna see my friend
Make it go away
I'm sick of everything, I'm gonna see my friend
Make it go away
I'm gonna see my friend, gonna see my friend
Make it go away
