<song artist="Pearl_Jam" title="Present_Tense">
Do you see the way that tree bends?
Does it inspire?
Leaning out to catch the sun's rays.
A lesson to be applied.
Are you getting something out of this
All-encompassing trip?
You can
Spend your time alone
Re-digesting past regrets, oh.
Or you can come to terms and realize,
You're the only one who can forgive yourself, for...
Makes much more sense
To live
In the present tense.
Have you ideas on how this life ends?
Checked your hands and studied the lines.
Have you the belief
That the road ahead 
Ascends off into the light
Seems that needlessly
It's getting harder
To find an approach and a way to live.
Are we getting something out of this all-encompassing trip?
You can spend your time alone
Re-digesting past regrets, oh.
Or you can
Come to terms and
Realize You're the only one
Who cannot forgive yourself for...
Makes much more sense
To live
In the present tense.
