<song artist="Pearl_Jam" title="Go">
Oh, please, don't go out on me, don't go on me now
Never acted up before, don't go on me now
I swear I never took it for granted, just thought of it now
Suppose I abused you, just passing it on
Go
Fuck
Once fastened, servile
Now you're getting sharp
Moving oh so swiftly with such disarm
I pulled the covers over your head, should've pulled the alarm
Turned to my nemesis, a fool, not a fucking god
No
Time
Suck
My
Please don't go on me
Don't go on me
Don't go on me
Don't go on me
Don't go on me
Please
Oh
Suck
Blood
Touch
Please
Tunnel vision
Tuck
Time
See
Please, please, please
Don't go on me
Don't go on me
Don't go on me
Don't go on me
Please, don't you want me?
Don't go on me
Please, don't go on me
