<song artist="Pearl_Jam" title="Big_Wave">
I used to be crustacean, oh
In an underwater nation, yeah
And I surf in celebration, oh
Of a billion adaptations, yeah yeah
Got me a big wave, ride me a big wave, got me a big wave
Got me a big wave, ride me a big wave, got me a big wave
I feel the need planted in me
Millions of years ago
Can't you see the ocean's size?
Defining time and tide arising
Arms laid upon me
Being so kind to let me ride
I scream in affirmation, oh
Of connecting dislocations, yeah
And exceeding limitation, oh
By achieving levitation, yeah
Got me a big wave, ride me a big wave, got me a big wave
Got me a big wave, ride me a big wave, got me a big wave
I feel the need planted in me
Millions of years ago
Can't you see the ocean's size?
Defining time and tide arising
Arms laid upon me
Being so kind to let me ride
Got me a ride
Got me a ride
Oh
