<song artist="Pearl_Jam" title="My_Generation">
People try to put us...
Talkin' 'bout my generation...
Just because we...get around...
Talkin' 'bout my generation...
Things they do will all go c-c-cold...
Talkin' 'bout my generation...
Hope I die before I get old...
Talkin' 'bout my generation...
My generation...it's my generation,baby...
Why don't ya all...fuck off...
Talkin' 'bout my generation...
Don't try to d-d-dig what we all say...
Talkin' 'bout my generation...
I'm not tryin' to cause a b-b-big sensation...
Talkin' 'bout my generation...
Talkin' 'bout my,my,my,my,my,my...generation...
My generation...it's my generation,baby...
My generation...it's my generation,baby...
Why don't ya all fade away...
Now don't try and dig what we all say...
I'm not tryin' to cause a b-b-big sensation...
Talkin' 'bout my,my,my,my,my,my...generation...
My generation...my generation,baby...
Talk,talk about,my generation...what about...
