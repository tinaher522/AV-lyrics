<song artist="Pearl_Jam" title="Hitchhiker">
You fool
Dude what d'you think you're doing
So you're lost
My problem is not
Conductor says
Off of my train
Be understood
Guess those relationships ain't my thing
Even if I could
You ain't the kinda person I would help anyway
I'm about to explode
Cause I can't carry your load
Hitchhiker
You're cool
and coke and your calculations
We're friends
Only because of my situation
I'm about to unload
Cause I can't carry your load
Hitchhiker
So be gone
Too soon is too late
I want no delay
So be gone
Get your food of someone else's plate
Go tell all o'your friends
I'm an idiot and you're great
Hitchhiker
Now Go...
