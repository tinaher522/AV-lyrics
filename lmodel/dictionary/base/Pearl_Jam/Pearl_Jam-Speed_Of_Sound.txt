<song artist="Pearl_Jam" title="Speed_Of_Sound">
Yesterdays, how quick they change
All lost and long gone now
It's hard to remember anything
Moving at the speed of sound
Moving with the speed of sound
And yet I’m still holding tight 
To this dream of distant light
And that somehow I’ll survive 
But this night has been a long one
Waiting on a sun that just don't come
Can I forgive what I
Cannot forget and live a lie?
I could give it one more try
Why deny this drive inside?
Just looking for some peace
Everytime I get me some it gets the best of me
Not much left you see
And yet I’m still holding tight 
To this dream of distant light
And that somehow I’ll survive 
But this night has been a long one
Waiting on a word that never comes
A whisper in the dark
Is that you or just my thoughts?
I'm wide awake and reaching out
It’s gone so quiet now
Could it be I’m farther out?
Moving faster than the speed of sound
