<song artist="Pearl_Jam" title="Blood">
Spin me round.
Roll me over.
Fucking circus.
Stab it down. 
One way needle.
Pulled so slowly.
Drains and spills.
Soaks the pages.
Fills their sponges.
It's my blood.
It's my blood.
Paint Ed big.
Turn Ed into one of his enemies.
It's my blood.
It's my blood.
It's my blood.
Stab it down.
Fill the pages.
Suck my blood dry.
Maker of my enemies.
Take my...
Why, why, why, why, why, why?
Rats.
