<song artist="Pearl_Jam" title="Last_Exit">
Lives opened and trashed,
Look, Ma, watch me crash,
No time to question.
Why'd nothing last?
Grasp and hold on,
We're dying fast.
Soon be over and I will relent.
Let the ocean swell, dissolve 'way my past.
Three days and maybe longer,
Won't even know I've left.
Under your tongue, I'm like a tab,
I will give you what you're not supposed to have.
Under my breath, I swear by sin, for better or worse,
A best we began.
Let the sun climb, oh, burn 'way my mask.
Three days and maybe longer.
Shed my skin at last... shed... shed.
Let the sun shine, burn 'way my mask.
Three days and maybe longer,
Won't ever find me here.
Let the ocean dissolve 'way my past.
Four days and not much longer...
Let my spirit pass...
This is, this is...
This is, this is...
This is, this is...
This is, this is... my last exit.
