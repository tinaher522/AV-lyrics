<song artist="Pearl_Jam" title="Army_Reserve">
How long must she stand
Before the ground, it gives way
To an endless fall
She can feel this war on her face
The stars on her pillow
She's folding in darkness
Begging for slumber
I'm not blind
I can see it coming
Looks like lightning
In my child's eye
I'm not frantic
I can feel it coming
Violently shakes
My body
Her son's slanted
Always giving her the sideways eye
The empty chair where dad sits
How loud can silence get?
And mom
She reassures
To contain him
But it's becoming a lie
She tells herself
And anyone else
Father is risking
His life for our freedoms
I'm not blind
I can see it coming
Looks like lightning
In my child's eye
I'm not frantic
I can feel it coming
Darling you'll save me
If you save yourself
