<song artist="Pearl_Jam" title="Public_Image">
You never listen to a word I said
You only seen me
For the clothes I wear
Or did the interest go so much deeper
It must have been
The length of my hair
The public image
What you wanted was never made clear
Behind the image was ignorance and fear
You hide behind this public machine
Still follow the same old scheme
Public image
Two sides to every story
Somebody had to stop me
I'm not the same as when I began
I will not be a property
Public image
Two sides to every story
Somebody had to stop me
I'm not the same as when I began
It's not a game of monopoly
Public image
Public image
You got what you wanted
The public image belongs to me
It's my entrance
My own creation
My grand finale
My goodbye
Public image
Public image
Goodbye
