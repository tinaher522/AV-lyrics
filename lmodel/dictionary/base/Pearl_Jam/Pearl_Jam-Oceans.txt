<song artist="Pearl_Jam" title="Oceans">
Hold on to the thread
The currents will shift, glide me towards
You know something's left
And we're all allowed to dream of the next
Uh, Uh-oh, the next, time we touch
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
You don't have to stray the oceans away
Waves roll in my thoughts
Hold tight the ring
The sea will rise
Please stand by the shore
Oh, oh, oh, I will be
I will be there once more
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Uh-huh, oh
Uh-huh, oh
