<song artist="Pearl_Jam" title="Red_Mosquito">
Watched from the window with a red mosquito,
I was not allowed to leave the room.
I saw the sun go down, and now it's comin' up,
Somewhere in the time between.
I was bitten, must have been the devil,
He was just payin' me a little visit,
A-reminding me of his presence,
Lettin' me know he's a-waitin' for me...
Red man's your neighbor, call it behavior,
While you're climbing up slippery hills,
Two steps ahead of him, punctures in your neck,
Hoverin' just above your bed...
Hoverin' just above your bed...
I was bitten, must have been the devil,
He was just payin' me a little visit,
A-reminding me of his presence,
Lettin' me know he's a-waitin', he's a-waitin' for me.
If I had known then what I know now...
