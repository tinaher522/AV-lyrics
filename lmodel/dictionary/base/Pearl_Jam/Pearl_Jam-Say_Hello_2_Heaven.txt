<song artist="Pearl_Jam" title="Say_Hello_2_Heaven">
Please, mother of mercy
Take me from this place
And the long winded curses
I hear in my head
Words never listen
And teachers, oh, they never learn
But I'm warm from the candle
Though I feel too cold to burn
He came from an island
And he died from the street
And he hurt so bad like a soul breaking
But he never said nothing to me
Say hello to heaven, heaven, heaven
Say hello to heaven, heaven, heaven
New like a baby
Lost like a prayer
The sky was your playground
But the cold ground was your bed
I said poor stargazer
She's got no tears in her eyes
But smooth like a whisper
She knows that love heals all wounds with time
Now it seems like too much
Love is never enough
Yeah, you better seek out another road, baby
'Cause this one has ended abrupt, yeah, yeah, yeah
Say hello to heaven, heaven, heaven
Say hello to heaven, heaven, heaven
Say hello to heaven, heaven, heaven
I never wanted
To write these words down for you
With the pages of phrases
Of all the things we'll never do
Yeah, so I blow out, out the candle
And I put you to bed
Since you can't say to me now
How the dogs broke your bone
There's just one thing left to be said
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Say hello to heaven, heaven, heaven
Say hello to heaven, heaven, yeah, yeah
Say hello to heaven, heaven, yeah
