<song artist="Pearl_Jam" title="Black_Red_And_Yellow">
exponentially serving
perpetually unnerving
vehicle swerving
the adjectives they are all a blurring
freud walking the sidelines
clipboard scoring the brain
black magic painted traits
makes me sane
hormones firing like a fifty foot roman, yeah
please don't make me explain
don't matter anyway
phantom pain in my brain
it's all that's left of my leg
black and red and yellow
black and red and yellow
heard you repeat a what ya heard, what ya heard
me knowing the truth i cannot concur, na-na
hormones firing like a fifty foot roman, yeah
please don't make me explain
doesn't matter anyway
hormones firing like a fifty foot roman, yeah
please don't make me explain
yo bro
tell us what's happenin'
um i'm on the west, west side of,
on the west coast
give me a jingle
uh when you get in
from where the fuck you're at
hormones firing like a fifty foot roman, yeah
please don't make me explain
doesn't fucking matter anyway
hormones firing like a fifty foot roman, yeah
please don't make me explain
