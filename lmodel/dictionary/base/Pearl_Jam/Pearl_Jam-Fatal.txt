<song artist="Pearl_Jam" title="Fatal">
How good is he? 
how warm are his eyes 
you'll see it's not a reprise 
there he arrived 
too late and too tethered away 
to put on his suit and his tie 
how good is he? 
how warm is his heart 
or ego telling him which place to park 
did he relate, the message is clearly hardly 
grounds for dismissal outright 
grounds for dismissal outright 
I wake up and wait up 
when anger's in fashion 
I wake up and wait up 
it echoes through the mansions 
I wake up and wait up 
when april's in may, oh uh oh 
I wake up and wait up 
the answers are fatal 
the answers are fatal 
when I wait up and wake up 
the answers are fatal 
if he's truly out of sight 
is he truly out of mind? 
if he's truly out of sight.
