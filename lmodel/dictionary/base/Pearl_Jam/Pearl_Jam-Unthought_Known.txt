<song artist="Pearl_Jam" title="Unthought_Known">
All the thoughts you never see
You're always thinking
Brain is wired, brain is deep
Oh, are you sinking?
Feel the path of every day
Which road you taking?
Breathing hard, making hay
Yeah, this is living
Look for love and evidence
That you're worth keeping
Swallowed whole in negatives
It's so sad and sickening
Feel the air up above
A pool of blue sky
Fill the air up with love
Oh, black with starlight
Feel the sky blanket you
With gems and rhinestones
See the path cut by the moon
For you to walk on
For you to walk on
Nothing left, nothing left, nothing there, nothing left
Nothing left, nothing left, nothing there, nothing left
Nothing left, nothing left, nothing there, nothing left
See the path cut by the moon
For you to walk on
See the waves on distant shores
Awaiting your arrival
Dream the dreams of other men
You'll be no one's rival
Dream the dreams of others then
You will be no one's rival
You will be no one's rival
A distant time, a distant space
That's where we're living
A distant time, a distant place
So what you giving?
What you giving?
