<song artist="Pearl_Jam" title="Breath">
Oh, tonight began with anything
Shaft of a light, a warm breath and a scream, ah yeah
Oh, tamper if you like between the doors, oh yeah uh huh
Oh, can't expect to go out, to go out
With anything, anything more
Oh reach the door
A breath and a- oh reach the door
And a la la la la yeah
Life ain't what it's worth
A breath and a- oh reach the door
All these reaching hands out grabbin' things, but me
Day in, day out, accumulating, ah yeah
Oh, I suggest you step out on your porch
Oh yeah, huh, huh, huh, huh, yeah
Run away my son, see it all, oh, see the world
Oh reach the door
A breath and a- oh reach the door
And a la la la la yeah
Life ain't what it's worth
A breath and a- oh reach the door
Come - here it comes
There it goes - when it comes
Where it goes - where it comes
Can't see through the faith, whoa
Ooh, come - here it comes
There it goes, grasp what you can
Until there's something inside your head, yeah
Oh, if I knew where it was I would take you there
There's much more than this, ooh
Much more than this
Oh, see the world- much more than, oh
Much more than
Why?
