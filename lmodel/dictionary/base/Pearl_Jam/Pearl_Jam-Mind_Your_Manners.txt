<song artist="Pearl_Jam" title="Mind_Your_Manners">
I got an unfortunate feeling
I been beaten down
I feel that I'm done believing
Now the truth is coming out
What they're taking is 
More than a vow
They're taking young innocents 
And then they throw 'em on a burning pile, ah yea
And all along they're saying
"Mind your manners!"
I caught myself believing 
That I needed God
And if it's out there somewhere 
We sure could use hymn now
Try my patience
My patience tried
This world's a long love letter
That makes me want to cry, ah ah eh eh
And all along they're saying 
"Mind your manners!"
That's all they're saying
Self-realized and metaphysically redeemed 
May not live another life
May not solve our mystery
Right 'round the corner
Could be bigger than ourselves
We could will it to the sky 
Or we could something else
And all along they're saying
"Mind your manners!"
Always praying
Self-realized and metaphysically redeemed 
May not live another life
May not solve our mystery
Right 'round the corner
Could be bigger than ourselves
We could will it to the sky 
Or we could something else
Go to heaven (that's swell)
How you like your living in Hell?
Go to heaven (that's swell)
How you like your living Hell? 
Go to heaven (that's swell)
How you like your living Hell?
