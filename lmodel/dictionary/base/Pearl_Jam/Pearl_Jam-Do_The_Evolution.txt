<song artist="Pearl_Jam" title="Do_The_Evolution">
I'm ahead, I'm a man
I'm the first mammal to wear pants, yeah
I'm at peace with my lust
I can kill 'cause in god I trust, yeah
It's evolution, baby
I'm at peace, I'm the man
Buying stocks on the day of the crash, yeah
On the loose, I'm a truck
All the rolling hills, I'll flatten them out, yeah
It's herd behavior, uh huh
It's evolution, baby
Admire me, admire my home
Admire my son, he's my clone
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
This land is mine, this land is free
I'll do what I want but irresponsibly
It's evolution, baby
I'm a thief, I'm a liar
There's my church, I sing in the choir:
Hal-le-lu-jah
Hal-le-lu-jah
Admire me, admire my home
Admire my son, admire my clones
Cause we know, appetite for a nightly feast
Those ignorant Indians got nothing on me
Nothin', why?
Because, it's evolution, baby!
I am ahead, I am advanced
I am the first mammal to make plans, yeah
I crawled the Earth, but now I'm higher
2010, watch it go to fire
It's evolution, baby
It's evolution, baby
Aaaaahhhh, do the evolution!
Come on!
C'mon, c'mon!
