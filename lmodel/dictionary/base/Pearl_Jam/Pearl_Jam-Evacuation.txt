<song artist="Pearl_Jam" title="Evacuation">
The sirens scream wanton attention
Time to take heed and change direction
Time to take stock and make omissions
Evacuation
Evacuation
Time to take leave all formal functions
Time to plant seeds of a reconstruction
No time this time to feign reluctance
It's like you're waiting for a diamond shore to wash your way.
Bets put aside you're evil
Lets crawl into your face
A vision vague or not raising a frightful wake you up
Time for evacuation
Evacuation
Evacuation
Evacuation
Evacuation
Evacuation
There was a solemn man
Watched his twilight disappear (in the sand)
Altered by a falling eagle. A warning sign. Sign.
He sensed that worry could be strength with a plan he said,
"Time for evacuation."
Evacuation
Evacuation
Evacuation
Evacuation
Evacuation
Evacuation
Evacuation
Evacuation
Evacuation
Evacuation
Evacuation
