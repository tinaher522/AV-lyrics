<song artist="Pearl_Jam" title="My_Father's_Son">
I come from genius
And I am my father's son
Yeah, too bad he was a psychopath
And now I'm the next in line
Then there's dear mother, yeah Shirley
She's a work of art
Never got top dollar
But she gave us all our start
Can I get a reprieve?
This gene pool drowning me
Can I get a release?
I'm a volunteer amputee
From the moment I fail
I call on DNA
Why such betrayal?
Got me tooth and nail
Yeah, how's about one conversation
With nothing else left to be had?
With this your young long lost son
And his never had dear old dad
Oh, forget the insemination
And for that, I'm supposed to be glad?
What a pity you left us so soon
To climb your mountain of regret
Can I get a reprieve?
This gene pool dark and deep
Can I get a release?
Can I volunteer amputee?
From the moment I fail
I call on DNA
Why such betrayal?
I gotta set sail
Hoo
Hoo
All the bright lights shining 
As you're trying to breathe in thin air
Cannot forget your hiding
Collected wounds left unhealed
When every thought you're thinking 
Sinks you darker than a new moon sky 
The far away lights rising
In the whites of your eyes 
Now father, you're dead and gone 
And I'm finally free to be me
Thanks for all your fucked-up gifts
For which I got no sympathy
Now I'm living in a war torn place
Hear the bombs, a fifth Symphony
Thanks for this and thanks for that 
I gotta let go legacy
Can I get a reprieve?
This gene pool drowning me 
Can I beg a release?
Can I volunteer amputee
From the moment I fail
I call on DNA 
Why such betrayal?
Yeah, I gotta set sail
Hoo
Oh yeah
