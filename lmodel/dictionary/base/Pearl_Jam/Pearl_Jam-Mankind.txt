<song artist="Pearl_Jam" title="Mankind">
You'll be...
Going out with radio.
Going out with disco.
Going out like bacchanal.
I'll be...
Going out with telephone
Going out alone.
To the radar zone.
It's all just inadvertent imitation,
And I don't mean mine.
It's all across this nation.
If it's just inadverdent simulation,
A pattern in all mankind,
What's got the whole world fakin' it?
I'll be...
Playing with my magazine.
Using up my Listerine.
Like Ovaltine.
And you'll be...
Dipping in your battleship.
For the latest tip.
For the latest dream.
It's all just inadvertent imitation,
And I don't mean mine.
It's all across this nation.
If it's just inadverdent simulation,
A pattern in all mankind,
What's got the whole world fakin' it?
If it's just inadvertent imitation,
A pattern in all mankind,
What's got the whole world fakin' it?
What's got the whole world fakin'?
What's got the whole world fakin'?
What's got the whole world fakin'?
What's got the whole world fakin'?
What's got the whole world fakin'?
What's got the whole world fakin' it, yeah?
