<song artist="Pearl_Jam" title="Getaway">
Everyone’s a critic looking back up the river
Every boat is leaking in this town
Everybody's thinking they can all be delivered
Sitting in a box like lost and found
But I found my place and it’s alright
We’re all searching for a better way
Get this off my plate. it’s alright
I got my own way to believe
Find a lighthouse in the dark stormy weather
We all could use a sedative right now
Holy rollers sitting with their backs to the middle
All hands on deck, sinking is the bow
And if you wanna have to pray, it's alright
We all be thinking with our different brains
Get yours off my plate, it's alright
I got my own way to believe
It's okay
Sometimes you find yourself 
Having to put all your faith
In no faith 
Mine is mine and yours won't take its place
Now make your getaway
Science says we're making love like the lizards
Try and say that fossils ain't profound
Simon says that we are not allowed to consider
Simon says, "Stand-up. Sit-down. You're out!"
But I found my place and it's alright
Oh, bearing witness to some stranger days 
Get yours off my plate, it's alright
I got my own ways to believe
It's okay
Sometimes you find yourself
Being told to change your ways
There's no way 
Mine is mine and yours won't take its place
Now make your getaway, hey hey
It's okay
Sometimes you find yourself 
Having to put all your faith
In no faith
Mine is mine and yours won't take its place
Now make your getaway
It's okay
Sometime you find yourself 
Being told to change your ways
For Gods sake
Mine is mine and yours won't take its place 
Now make your getaway
Now make your getaway
