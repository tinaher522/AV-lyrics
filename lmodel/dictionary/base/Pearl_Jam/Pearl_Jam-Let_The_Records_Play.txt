<song artist="Pearl_Jam" title="Let_The_Records_Play">
When the kingdom comes
He puts his records on 
And with his blistered thumb hits play 
And with the volume up
He goes and fills his cup
And lets the drummer's drum take away the pain
The pain
Breaking, forsaken
What's that you're taking?
Aaw, needing the feeling 
He lets the records play
Should the future dim
A cigarette lights hymn
Vaporized a green light grin
And when the shotglass talks
He knows to listen up
Until he's nice and numb again
Again, again
Shakened, awakened
Not one for faking
The kneeling, his healing
He lets the records play 
There's wisdom in his ways
I been down and I fell so hard and far from grace
I been hurt and I still recall the flaws on her face
I been off, but I'm on, up above my feet, my feet again
Eh
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
Shaken, foresaken
What's that your taking?
Aaw, needing the feeling
He lets the records play
Shakened, awakened 
Not one for faking
The kneeling, his healing
He lets the records play
Oh, there's wisdom in his ways
Ow
Get on with it, boy
Faster, little faster
