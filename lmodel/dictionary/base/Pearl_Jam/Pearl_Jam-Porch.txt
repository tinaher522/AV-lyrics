<song artist="Pearl_Jam" title="Porch">
What the fuck is this world?
Running to, you didn't
Leave a message, at least I
Could have heard your voice one last time
Daily minefield, this could
Be my time by you
Would you hit me?
Would you hit me?
Oh
Oh, ow
All the bills go by, and
Initiatives are taken up
By the middle
There ain't gonna be any middle any more
And the cross I'm bearing home
Ain't indicative of my place
Left the porch
Left the porch, oh, oh
Hear my name
Take a good look
This could be the day
Hold my hand
Walk beside me
I just need to say
Hear my name
Take a good look
This could be the day
Hold my hand
Lie beside me
I just need to say
I could not take
Uh, just one day
I know that I would not ever
Touch you, Hold you, feel you
Ever hold
Never again
Hey
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
