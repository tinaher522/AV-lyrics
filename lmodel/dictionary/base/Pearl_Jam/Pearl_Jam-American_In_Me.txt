<song artist="Pearl_Jam" title="American_In_Me">
It's the Amerikan in me
that makes me watch the blood
Flowin out of the bullet hole in his head
It's the Amerikan in me
that makes me watch TV
See on the news, listen to what the man said.
He said: ask not what you can do for your country.
What's your country been doing to you?
Ask not what what you can do for your country.
What's your country been doing to your mind?
It's the Amerikan in me
says it an honor to die
In a war that's just some politician's lie.
It's the Amerikan in me
that makes me watch TV
See how they burned the SLA, they said
Ask not what what you can do for your country.
What's your country been doing to you?
Ask not what what you can do for your country.
What's your country been doing to you?
In the USA
In the USA
It's the Amerikan in me
that makes me watch the blood
Flowin out of the bullet hole in his head
It's the Amerikan in me
that never wonders why
Kennedy was murdered by the FBI
Ask not...
