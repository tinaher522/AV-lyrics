<song artist="Pearl_Jam" title="Amongst_The_Waves">
What used to be a house of cards
Has turned into a reservoir
Saved the tears that were waterfalling
Let's go swim tonight, darling
And once outside the undertow
Just you and me and nothing more
If not for love I would be drowning
I've seen it work both ways, but I am up
Riding high amongst the waves
I can feel like I have a soul that has been saved
I can feel like I've put away my early grave
I gotta say it now better loud than too late
Remember back the early days
When you were young and and thus amazed
Suddenly the channel changed
The first time you saw blood
Cut to later, now you're strong
You've bled yourself, the wounds are gone
It's rare when there is nothing wrong
Survived and you're amongst the fittest
Love ain't love until you give it up
Up riding high amongst the waves
I can feel like I have a soul that has been saved
I can see the light coming through the clouds in rays
I gotta say it now better loud than too late
I gotta say it now better loud than too late, hey yeah
Riding high amongst the waves
I can feel like I have a soul that has been saved
I can see the light coming through the clouds in rays
I gotta say it now better loud than too late
I got to say it now better loud than too late
Say it now better loud than too late
Hey, yeah
