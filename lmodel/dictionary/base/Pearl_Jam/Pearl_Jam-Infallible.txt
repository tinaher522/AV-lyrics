<song artist="Pearl_Jam" title="Infallible">
Keep on locking your doors
Keep on building your floors
Keep on just as before
Pay disasters no mind
Didn't get you this time
No prints left at the crime
Our ship's come in and it's sinking
Of everything that's possible
In the hearts and minds of men
Somehow it is the biggest things 
That keep on slipping right through our hands
By thinking we're infallible
We are tempting fate instead
Time we best begin 
Here at the ending
Wanna third second chance
Put your faith in big hands
Pay no more than a glance
All good things come to an end
This could be good as it gets 
How's the view from the fence?
You think we been here before
You are mistaken
Of everything that's possible
In the hearts and minds of men
When progress could be plausible 
In reverse we curse ourselves
By thinking we're infallible
We are tempting fate instead
Time we best begin
Here at the ending
Of everything that's possible 
In the hearts and minds of men, ay yeah
Somehow it is the biggest things
That keep on slipping right through our hands, yeah
By thinking we're infallible
Oh, we are tempting fate instead
Oh yeah yeah
Yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah
Time we best begin 
Here at the ending
Here at the ending
Keep on locking your doors
Keep on building your floors
Keep on just as before
