<song artist="Pearl_Jam" title="Brother">
Hand over my face
I am related to my enemy
Ooh, our house on fire
And big brother, brother try to put the blame on me
Oh, little sister
You and me could rise above
Oh, ain't no brother, back to back to back
I better back off, yeah
Ooh, uh-huh
He used a flag as a bandage
Well, my big brothers they pocket hypocrisy
In the closet, my pleasures
'Cause big brother, brother don't want to just let me be, yeah
Oh, little sister
You and me could rise above
Oh, ain't no brother, back to back to back
I better back off
Oh, little sister
You and me could run for long
Oh, ain't no brother, back to back to back
I better back off
Brother, now, yeah
Hey now, yeah
Hey, now
In my mind there's a clearing
Rose skies flow through gray skies
In no certain way
And I'm trying
I'm flying, I'm flying
Wow
Ooh, back to back to back, I better back off
Back, back, back, a brother mother
Back to back to back, back a-back back
Brother
Brother big
Brother, brother, brother, oh, hey now
Brother, hey now, oh, brother
Hey, uh, ha, oh, hey now, brother
Ah brother, hey now
Brother, oh whoa
Hey now
