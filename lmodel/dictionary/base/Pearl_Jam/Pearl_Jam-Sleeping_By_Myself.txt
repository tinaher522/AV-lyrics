<song artist="Pearl_Jam" title="Sleeping_By_Myself">
I should have known there was someone else
Down below I always kept it to myself 
Now I believe in nothing 
Not today
As I move myself out of your sight
I'll be sleeping by myself tonight 
I could never go with no one else 
The hurt don't show, but who knows
Time will tell 
Now I believe in nothing
But the pain
And I can't see this turning out right
Oh, I'll be sleeping by myself tonight
Forever be sad and lonely
Forever never be the same 
I close my eyes, wait for a sign
Am I just waiting in vain?
I close my eyes, wait for a sign
Am I just waiting in vain?
Oh, I believe in love and disaster
Sometimes the two are just the same
I'm beginning to see
What's left of me 
Is gonna have to be free to survive 
I'll be sleeping by myself tonight
I believe in nothing 
But the pain
And I can't see this turning out right 
Oh, I'll be sleeping by myself
I'll be sleeping by myself
I'll be sleeping by myself tonight
