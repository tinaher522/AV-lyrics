<song artist="Pearl_Jam" title="Comatose">
Consider me an object
Put me in a vacuum
Free of all conditions
Free of air and friction
Yeah, I'll be hanging upside down
And there I will swing for all eternity
Feel it rising
Yeah, next stop falling
Feel it rising
Comatose, with no fear of falling
Consider me an abscess
Leave me in my vacuum
Blood on all the pistons
Running my transmission
Feel it rising
Yeah, next stop falling
Feel it rising
Comatose, with no fear of falling
Feel it rising
Yeah, next stop falling
Feel it rising
High above, I'll break the law
If it's illegal to be in love
Leave the hatred on the cross
Yeah, I'll be hanging upside down
And here I will swing for all eternity
Feel it rising
Yeah, next stop falling
Feel it rising
Comatose, with no fear of falling
Feel it rising
Yeah, next stop falling
Feel it rising
Something never thought you'd be part of
