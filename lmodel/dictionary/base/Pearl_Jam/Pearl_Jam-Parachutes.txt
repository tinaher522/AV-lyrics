<song artist="Pearl_Jam" title="Parachutes">
Why deny all the troubles when combined
With the missing links, it don't feel like home now
That you're gone, all the troubles suddenly explained infinitum
You're always wishing and never here at home, you
All the dreams we shared and lights we turned on
But the house is getting dark
And I don't want to know your past
But together share the dawn
And I won't need nothing else 'cause when we're dead
We would've had it all
And I wouldn't falling from the sky, tell you
Parachutes have opened now
Heaven knows if there's a ceiling
Come so low with the kneeling
Please know that, that I got 
All the friends I'm needing, before my lights go out
As the doors are closing now 
And far away will be my home
And to grasp this, I don't know
But I don't need
Further back and forth, a wave will break on me today
And love
Wish the world could glow again with love
One can't seem to have enough
And war
Break the sky and tell me what it's for
I'll travel there on my own
And love
What a different life
Had I not found this love with you
