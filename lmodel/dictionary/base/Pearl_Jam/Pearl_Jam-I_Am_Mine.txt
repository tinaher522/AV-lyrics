<song artist="Pearl_Jam" title="I_Am_Mine">
The selfish, they're all standing in line
Faithing and hoping to buy themselves time
Me, I figure as each breath goes by
I only own my mind
The north is to south what the clock is to time
There's east and there's west and there's everywhere life
I know I was born and I know that I'll die
The in-between is mine
I am mine
And the feeling, it gets left behind
All the innocence lost at one time
Significant behind the eyes
There's no need to hide
We're safe tonight
The ocean is full 'cause everyone's crying
The full moon is looking for friends at high tide
The sorrow grows bigger when the sorrow's denied
I only know my mind
I am mine
And the meaning, it gets left behind
All the innocence lost at one time
Significant behind the eyes
There's no need to hide
We're safe tonight, whoa
And the feelings that get left behind
All the innocence broken with lies
Significance between the lines
We may need to hide
And the meanings that get left behind
All the innocence lost at one time
We're all different behind the eyes
There's no need to hide
