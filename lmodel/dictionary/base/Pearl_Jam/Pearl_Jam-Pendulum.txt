<song artist="Pearl_Jam" title="Pendulum">
Can't know what's high
Till you been down so low
The future's bright 
Lit up with nowhere to go 
To and fro the pendulum throws
We are here and then we go 
My shadow left me long ago
Understand what we don't know 
This might pass, this might last, this may grow
Easy come and easy go 
Easy left me a long time ago
I'm in the fire, but I'm still cold
Nothing works, works for me anymore
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah (To and fro the pendulum throws)
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah (To and fro the pendulum throws)
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah (to and fro)
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah (to and fro)
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah (to and fro)
