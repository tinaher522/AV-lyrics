<song artist="Pearl_Jam" title="Come_Back">
If I keep holding out
Will the light shine through
Under this broken roof
It's only rain that I feel
I've been wishing out the days
Oh oh oh, come back
I have been planning out
All that I'd say to you
Since you slipped away
Know that I still remain true
I've been wishing out the days
Please say that if you hadn't gone now
I wouldn't have lost you another way
From wherever you are
Oh oh, oh oh oh, come back
And these days they linger on
And in the night I've been waiting for
The real possibility that I may meet you in my dreams
I go to sleep
If I don't fall apart
Will my memory stay clear
So you had to go
And I had to remain here
But the strangest thing today
So far away and yet you feel so close
And I'm not gonna question it any other way
There must be an open door
For you, ooh, to come back
And the days they linger on
And every night when I'm waiting for
The real possibility that I may meet you in my dreams
Sometimes you're there and you're talking back to me
Come the morning I can swear that you're next to me
And it's okay
It's okay
It's okay
Oh, I'll be here, come back, come back
I, I'll be here, come back, come back
Oh, I'll be here, come back, come back
Whoo, whoo
Whoo, whoo
