<song artist="Pearl_Jam" title="In_The_Moonlight">
In the moonlight...
Gettin'. Wind out to get back. It's a...
Steady shore to her land.
It's gettin' closer to the fence.
In the moonlight...
Givin'. Two lost wings.
A beautiful star sea.
A wonderful sense of beauty.
In the moonlight...
It's a love drawn nearer.
Darkened days are spent in.
A night bird is followin' you all the time.
Under a star-lined ceiling...
And darkness so sleep. Ah,...
Your sense is revealed...
In the moonlight...
It's a love drawn nearer.
Darkened days are spent in.
A night bird is followin' you all the time.
It's a love drawn nearer.
Darkened days are spent in.
A night bird is followin' you,... it's followin' you.
A night bird is followin' you all the time.
