<song artist="Pearl_Jam" title="Immortality">
Vacate is the word
Vengeance has no place in me to hurt
Cannot find the comfort in this world
Artificial tears
Vessel stabbed, next up, volunteers?
Vulnerable, wisdom can't adhere
A truant finds home and a wish to hold onto
But there's a trapdoor in the sun
It's immortality…
As privileged as a whore
Victims in demand for public show
Swept out through the cracks beneath the door
Holier than thou, how?
Surrendered, executed, anyhow…
Scrawl resolved, cigar box on the floor
A truant finds home and a wish to hold onto
There's a trapdoor in the sun
It's immortality...
I cannot stop the thought running in the dark
Coming up a which way sign
All good truants must decide
Oh, stripped and sold, mom…
Auctioned forearm and whiskers in the sink
Truant moves on, cannot stay long
Some die just to live…
Oh…
