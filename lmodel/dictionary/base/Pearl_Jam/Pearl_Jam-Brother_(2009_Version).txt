<song artist="Pearl_Jam" title="Brother_(2009_Version)">
Hand over my face
I am related to my enemy
Our house on fire
and big brother, brother tried to put the blame on me
Oh, little sister, you and me can rise above
Oh, ain't no brother - Back to back to back
Oh better back on
You use the flag as a bandage
Oh my big brother's a pocket hypocrisy
In the closet, my pleasures 'cause big brother,
brother don't wanna just let me be
Oh, little sister, you and me can rise above
Oh, ain't no brother - Back to back to back
Oh better back on
Oh, little sister, you and me can walk alone
Oh, ain't no brother - Back to back to back
Oh better back on
Hey, now (brother)
Hey, now
Hey, now
Hey, now
In my mind there's a clearing
Rose gardens open grey skies
Oh no one's hurtin' 
and I'm joyin'
I'm flying ... I'm flyin'
Oh, back to back to back, oh better back on -
back to back to back, back c'mon -
back to back to back to back to back, back
Hey, now (brother)
Big (hey now) brother, brother, brother
Hey, now
Brother (hey now...)
