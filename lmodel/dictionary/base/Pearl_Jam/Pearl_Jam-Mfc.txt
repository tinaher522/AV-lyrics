<song artist="Pearl_Jam" title="Mfc">
Sliding out of reverse into drive, this
Wheel will be turning right, then straight
Off in the sunset she'll ride
She can remember a time denied
Stood by the side of the road, spilled like wine now
She's out on her own and I'm high
There's no leaving here
Ask- I'm an ear
She's disappeared
They said that timing was everything
Made him want to be everywhere
There's a lot to be said for nowhere
There's no leaving here
Ask- I'm an ear
He's disappeared
There's no leaving here
Ask- I'm an ear
Fuck it- we've disappeared
