<song artist="Pearl_Jam" title="Education">
I'm questioning my education 
Is my education all i am now? 
While you're deciding i've been finding 
Looking around in the here and now 
If I'd been taught from the beginning
Would my fears now be winning? 
I'm questioning my own equation 
Is my own equation relevant somehow 
The flags will wave and the news is breaking 
See the man who came, forgot his own tie 
If I'd been taught from the beginning
Would my fears now be winning? 
A wild world, figured out the answers 
I'll be in my own, dancing out, ou-out yeaaah 
I'm questioning my education 
Rewinding, what does it show? 
Could be, the truth, it becomes you 
I'm a seed wondering why i'm grown.
