<song artist="Celine_Dion" title="Sleep_Tight">
Now Hush 
My Little one, 
Don't be afraid, your daddy's right here
it's just a little dream, 
and now it's gone there's nothin to fear
so close your eyes, I'll sing a sweet lullaby
lay your head close to my heart.
And sleep tight
may angels hover over you
they'll spread their wings to keep you safe and warm.
The starlight, the heavens high above you
will light a path at you to find your way back home.
Yes sleep tight
And now, my sleepy head, your carriage weighs
to take you off to bed
Let go tiny hands and drift away to a bright enchanted land 
I promise you, your sweetest dreams will come true
Now leave this weary world behind
And sleep tight
may angels hover over you
they'll spread their wings to keep you safe and warm.
The starlight, the heavens high above you
will light a path at you to find your way back home.
yeah sleep tight
so close your eyes and wish upon the brightest star
cause when you dream it doesn't matter where you are
near to me or very far
I'll always be with you
And sleep tight
may angels hover over you
they'll spread their wings to keep you safe and waaaarm.
The starlight, the heavens high above you
will light a path at you to find your way back home.
And sleep tight
may angels hover over you
they'll spread their wings to keep you safe and waaaarm.
I'll keep you safe, safe and warm
I'll keep you safe!
