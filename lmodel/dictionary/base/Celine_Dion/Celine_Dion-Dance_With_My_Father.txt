<song artist="Celine_Dion" title="Dance_With_My_Father">
Back when I was a child
Before life removed all the innocence
My father would lift me high and dance with my mother and me and then
Spin me around â€˜til I fell asleep
Then up the stairs he would carry me
And I knew for sure I was loved
If I could get another chance, another walk, another dance with him
I'd play a song that would never ever end
How I'd love, love, love
To dance with my father again
Sometimes I'd listen outside her door
And I'd hear how my mama cried for him
I pray for her even more than me
I pray for her even more than me
I know I'm praying for much too much
But could you send back the only man she loved
I know you don't do it usually
But dear Lord she's dying
To dance with my father again
Every night I fall asleep and this is all I ever dream
