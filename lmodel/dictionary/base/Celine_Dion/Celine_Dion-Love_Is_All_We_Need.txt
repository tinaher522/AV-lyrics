<song artist="Celine_Dion" title="Love_Is_All_We_Need">
She was living in a perfect house, 
with pictures of smiling faces. 
But there's a different story told inside, 
underneath it all. 
With the sunglasses and makeup on, 
blaming the stairs and bases. 
They all knew (didn't even ask is something wrong), 
so they wait... 
Now she's gone. 
I don't understand the concept of, 
the power of one is stronger. 
Why don't people seem to care at all, 
as long as it's not about them... 
I say.... 
I guess we've underestimated love, 
well why would we hurt each other. 
Don't you find that, ironical ? 
When Love Is All We Need oh yeah 
He is living down his sunset strip, 
singing the blues for money. 
It's easy just to look the other way, 
when you have it all. 
He's reaching out to find a helping hand, 
but nobody seems to bother. 
Hear them say (It's not my problem so it's not my call.) 
You're on your own 
Through it all. 
I don't understand the concept of, 
the power of one is stronger. 
Why don't people seem to care at all, 
as long as it's not about them... 
I say.... 
I guess we've underestimated love, 
well why would we hurt each other. 
Don't you find that, ironical ? 
When Love Is All We Need oh yeah 
When all becomes too real.. 
We have a tendency to be.. 
Too scared to face it. 
It's breaking my heart... to see... 
When Love Is All We Need 
I don't understand the concept of, 
the power of one is stronger. 
Why don't people seem to care at all, 
as long as it's not about them... 
I say.... 
Guess we've underestimated love, 
well why would we hurt each other. 
Don't you find that, ironical ? 
When Love Is All We Need oh yeah
