<song artist="Celine_Dion" title="My_Precious_One">
My precious one, my tiny one, lay down your pretty head.
My dearest one my sleepy one, its time to go to bed
My precious one my darling one don't let your lashes weep.
My cherished one my weary one it's time to go to sleep.
Just lie your head and give your cares to me.
Just close your eyes and fall into the sweetest dream, cause in my loving arms.
Your safe as you will ever be so hush my dear and sleep.
And in your dreams you'll ride on angels wings.
That's when the stars will touch the face of God...
and if you should awake
My precious one, my tiny one
I'll kiss your tender cheek
And underneath the smiling moon
I'll send you back to sleep.
