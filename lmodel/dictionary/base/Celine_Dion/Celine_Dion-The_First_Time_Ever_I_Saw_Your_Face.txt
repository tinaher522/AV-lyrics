<song artist="Celine_Dion" title="The_First_Time_Ever_I_Saw_Your_Face">
The first time ever I saw your face
I thought the sun rose in your eyes
And the moon and stars were the gifts you gave
To the night and the empty skies, my love
The first time ever I kissed your mouth
I felt the earth turn in my hand
Like the trembling heart of a captive bird
That was there at my command, my love
The first time ever I lay with you
And felt your heart beat close to mine
The first time ever I saw your face
Your face, your face, your face.
