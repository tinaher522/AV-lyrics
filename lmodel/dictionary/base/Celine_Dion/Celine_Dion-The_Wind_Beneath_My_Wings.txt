<song artist="Celine_Dion" title="The_Wind_Beneath_My_Wings">
It must have been cold there in my shadow
To never have sunlight on your face
You've always been content to let me shine
You've always walked one step behind
I was the one with all the glory
While you were the one with all the strength
Only a face without a name
And I never once heard you complain
Did you ever no that you're my hero
And everything that I'd like to be
I can fly higher than an eagle
'Cause you are the wind beneath my wings
You might have thought it went unnoticed
But I've got it all here in my heart
I want you to know I know the truth
That I would be nothing without you
Did you ever know that you're my hero
And everything that I'd like to be
I can fly higher than an eagle
'Cause you are the wind beneath my wings
