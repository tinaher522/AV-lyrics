<song artist="Celine_Dion" title="Naked">
Under this midnight sky 
With you here by my side 
There's nothing that I could hide 
You know me better than anybody else 
All of myself revealed 
There is nothing I could conceal 
My soul is yours to steal 
Take me wherever you want to 
Baby I'm naked, Naked with you 
Feels like the first time 
I'm tremblin' shakin' my hearts overtaking, yeah 
Feels like I'm falling, all over again 
Baby come and take me 
I'm tremblin', shakin' 
I'm naked with you 
Whenever your awake 
It's almost like I'm afraid 
I only wanna' stay 
caught up in these stolen moments 
Let's loose ourselves tonight 
Forget the world for a while 
Make love til' morning light 
Take me wherever you want to 
Naked with you 
Tremblin', shakin my hearts overtakin' 
All over again 
Baby come and take me 
I'm tremblin' shakin' 
I'm naked with you 
I am naked with you 
Ohh yeah 
Cause I'm tremblin', shakin' 
I'm naked with you 
Feels like, I'm overtakin' 
All over again 
Oh Oh Oh yeah 
I'm naked, Naked with you 
Feels like the first time 
I'm tremblin' shakin' my hearts overtaking, yeah 
Feels like I'm falling, all over again 
Baby come and take me 
Cause' I'm tremblin', shakin', oh yeah, yeah, yeah 
I'm naked with you 
With you
