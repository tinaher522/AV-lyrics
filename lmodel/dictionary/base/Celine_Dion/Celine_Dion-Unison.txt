<song artist="Celine_Dion" title="Unison">
Somewhere tonite we come alive 
Two hearts ignite we're one of a kind 
Here we are undivided by anything 
Just you and I 
We've come so far no one else could ever 
Steal away what we confide 
Who wants to know? 
We stick together we're never apart 
Everybody knows who we are 
Because we are one we do it in unison 
We come together and stronger we are 
Just when the world can tear us apart 
We go on as one we do it in unison 
Gleam of an eye, flash of a smile 
Never too shy playin' ever so wild 
Here we are I', relying on no one else 
But you and I we've come so far 
No on else could ever steal away what we 
Confide who wants to know? 
Rockin' as one there's no time to stop 
I know what we've got we do it in unison 
Here we are undivided by anything 
Just you and I 
We've come so far no one else could ever 
Steal away what we confide 
Who wants to know?
