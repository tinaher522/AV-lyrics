<song artist="Celine_Dion" title="I'm_Alive_(Humberto_Gatica_Mix)">
I get wings to fly
Oh, oh, I'm alive, oh yes
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
When you call on me
When I hear you breathe
I get wings to fly, I feel that I'm alive
When you look at me
I can touch the sky
I know that I'm alive
When you bless the day
I just drift away
All my worries die
I'm glad that I'm alive
You've set my heart on fire
Filled me with love
Made me a woman on clouds above
And I couldn't get much higher
My spirit takes flight
'Cause I am alive, oh my love
When you call on me
(When you call on me, baby)
When I hear you breathe
(When I hear you breathe)
I get wings to fly
I feel that I'm alive, oh yeah, I'm alive
When you reach for me
(When you reach for me)
Raising spirits high
God knows that
That I'll be the one
Standing by through good and through trying times
And it's only begun
I can't wait for the rest of my life, give me five
When you call on me
(When you call on me)
When you reach for me
(When you reach for me)
I get wings to fly, I feel that
When you bless the day
(When you bless, you bless the day)
I just drift away
(I just drift away)
All my worries die
God knows that I'm alive, yeah, yeah, yeah
I get wings to fly
God knows that I'm alive
