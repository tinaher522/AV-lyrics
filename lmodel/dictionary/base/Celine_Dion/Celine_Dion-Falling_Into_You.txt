<song artist="Celine_Dion" title="Falling_Into_You">
And in your eyes I see ribbons of color
I see us inside of each other
I feel my conscience merge with yours
And I hear a voice say: "What's his is hers"
I'm falling into you (Falling into you)
This dream could come true
And it feels so good (Falling into you) falling into you
I was afraid to let you in here
Now I have learned love can't be made in fear
The walls begin to tumble down
And I can't even see the ground
I'm falling into you (Falling into you)
This dream could come true
And it feels so good (Falling into you) falling into you
Falling like a leaf
Falling like a star
Finding a belief
Falling where you are
Catch me, don't let me drop
Love me, don't ever stop
So close your eyes and let me kiss you
And while you sleep I will miss you
Oh, I'm falling into you (Falling into you)
This dream could come true
And it feels so good (Falling into you) falling into you
Falling like a leaf
Falling like a star
Finding a belief
Falling where you are
Falling into you
Falling into you
Falling into you
