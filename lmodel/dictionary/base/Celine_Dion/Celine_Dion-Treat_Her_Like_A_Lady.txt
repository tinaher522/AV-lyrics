<song artist="Celine_Dion" title="Treat_Her_Like_A_Lady">
GO, go go goes around, comes around, x3 go go
All the girl could want was a little attention
From a man who's strong and not to mention
Kiss and caressing her all night long wooooaaahh
But all that boy wants is to hit and run off
He and his friends-they sit and they laugh
Going around talking 'bout the girls they used in the past 
U gotta get what's comin' to u
For all the bad, bad things u do to your 
Lady, treat her like a lady
U'll make a good girl crazy
If u don't treat her like a lady 
Lady, treat her like a lady
U'll make a good girl crazy
If u don't treat her like a lady 
go go go goes around, comes around, go go!
She stopped going to church, she don't wanna go to school
She left with anger when he took her for a fool
Even though her friends tell her to just keep cool
Didn't tell her from the start just what he had planned
Right in her face with another woman
Now she's in jail for attacking her man 
U gotta get what's comin' to u
For all the bad, bad things u do to your 
Lady, treat her like a lady
U'll make a good girl crazy
If u don't treat her like a lady 
Lady, treat her like a lady
U'll make a good girl crazy
If u don't treat her like a lady 
go go go goes around, comes around, go go!
Treat her like a lady
Oh baby!
Treat her like a lady, baby
Treat her like a lady, baby
Treat her like a lady, ohhhhh
Treat her like a lady!
What goes around, comes around, go go!
What goes around, comes around, go go!
Somebody, somebody blocked the hit and ran, yes
Tell it to her straight, she can take the truth
Don't lead her on and on and leave her confused
Anyone would rather be alone than be used
Don't sit and think you'll hurt her feelings
She only wants to know just what the deal is
Next time beware of who's heart your breaking (or stealing)
