<song artist="Celine_Dion" title="If_Walls_Could_Talk">
These walls keep a secret
That only we know
But how long can they keep it?
'Cause we're two lovers, we lose control
We're two shadows
Chasing rainbows
Behind closed windows
Behind closed doors
If walls could talk
Oooh...they would say I want you more
They would say
Hey...ever feel like this before?
That you will always be the one for me
Two people making memories
Just too good to tell
These arms are never empty
When we're lying where we fell
We're painting pictures
Making magic
Taking chances
Making love
If walls could talk
Oooh...they would say I want you more
They would say
Hey...ever feel like this before?
And that you will always be the one for me
If walls had eyes
My...they would see the love inside
They would see
Me...in your arms in ecstasy
And with every move they'd know I love you so
When I'm feeling weak
You give me wings
When the fire has no heat
You light it up again
When I hear no violins
You play my every string
Stop the press
Hold the news
The secret's safe between me and you
Walls: Can you keep a secret?
If walls could talk
Oooh...they would say I want you more
They would say
Hey...ever feel like this before?
And that you will always be the one for me
If walls had eyes
My...they would see the love inside
They would see
Me...in your arms in ecstasy
And with every move they'd know I love you so
I love you so
Ooooh I love you so baby
Ooooh baby
Love you love you love you love you so honey
Love you love you love you so
In your arms in ecstasy
If they could see you and me baby
Just you and me baby
Oooooh
Oooooh baby
