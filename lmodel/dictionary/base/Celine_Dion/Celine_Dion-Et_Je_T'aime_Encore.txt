<song artist="Celine_Dion" title="Et_Je_T'aime_Encore">
Here the autumn ends, bringing back rain.
The old Chevy's dead, they tried to fix it in vain.
Ele's got her first teeth, little Jimmy's getting strong.
I'm learning guitar, I almost know a song.
I've found some Chanterelle at the market this morning.
I'd like to live in Rome, Oh, it'd be such a good thing.
Try to grow some flowers, The same I've tried before.
That's all for now, Oh yes... Je T'aime Encore.
But where are you?
So far, with no address.
How's life for you,
My hope is my only caress.
I've finally cut my hair.
I hear you say... at last.
It's been kinda strange,
But you see I survived.
When I'm asked, I go out.
I dance all night and more.
When I dance... Je T'aime Encore.
But where are you?
So far, with no address.
And how's life for you?
Time is my only caress.
hahahaaa hahahaa
Je t'aime Encore. Just like an old-fashioned song.
And it burns in my soul. Anything else is too long.
Oh more and more.
As strong as I can be.
Oui je T'aime Encore.
But you... you can not hear me.
