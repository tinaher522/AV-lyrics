<song artist="Celine_Dion" title="Why_Oh_Why">
Don't you know that your my reason
For my love, my life, my being
So secure and so so sure my
Heart would surely die without you 
I tried to swallow my pride
But I felt my heart start to tremble inside
Wish I didn't know cause I can't let you go
Tell me 
Why
Why when I looked in your eyes
i felt the trust start to die
why oh why 
When i still love you
its so hard to say good bye
How can you tell me it was nothing
Cause you took away everything I dreamed in
Just a night and I held you tight
When you know you were sleeping in my bed 
I tried to swallow my pride
But I felt my heart start to tremble inside
Wish I didn't know cause I can't let you go
Tell me 
Why
Why when I looked in your eyes
I felt my heart start to cry
Why o why
When I saw you with the other girl 
why Ooh why,
when i looked in your eyes
Cause I felt the trust start to die
Why o why
When I still love you
It's so hard to say goodbye 

Should I quietly leave through the door
Or maybe pretend the way things were once before
When I met you
I'll never forget you, so 
Why
Why when I looked in your eyes
I felt the trust start to die
why o why 
when i still love you 
its so hard to say goodbye

Why did you lie
