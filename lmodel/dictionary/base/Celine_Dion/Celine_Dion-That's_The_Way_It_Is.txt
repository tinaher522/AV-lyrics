<song artist="Celine_Dion" title="That's_The_Way_It_Is">
I can read your mind and I know your story
I see what you're going through, yeah
It's an uphill climb, and I'm feeling sorry
But I know it will come to you, yeah
Don't surrender 'cause you can win
In this game called Lerve
When you want it the most there's no easy way out
When you're ready to go and your heart's left in doubt
Don't give up on your faith
Love comes to those who believe it
And that's the way it is
When you question me for a simple answer
I don't know what to say, no
But it's plain to see, if you stick together
You're gonna find a way, yeah
So don't surrender 'cause you can win
In this thing called uh-leh-hehh-herrve
When you want it the most there's no easy way out
When you're ready to go and your heart's left in doubt
Don't give up on your faith
Love comes to those who believe it
And that's the way it is, that's the way it is
When life is empty with no tomorrow
And loneliness starts to call (Loneliness starts to call)
Baby, don't worry, forget your sorrow
'Cause love's gonna conquer it all
Oh, when you want it the most there's no easy way out
When you're ready to go and your heart's left in doubt
Don't give up on your faith
Love comes to those who believe it
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (And that's the way it is, baby, there's no easy way out)
No, no (When you're ready to go and your heart's left in doubt)
Don't give up on your faith
Love comes to those who believe it
And that's the way it is
That's the way it is (That's the way it is)
That's the way it is, baby (That's the way it is)
Don't give up on your faith
Love comes to those who believe it
And that's the way it is
