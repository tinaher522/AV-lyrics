<song artist="Celine_Dion" title="Refuse_To_Dance">
Got your invitation to the dance 
Wear your party dress 
Maybe I was just an innocent 
But I confess 
I never even knew the song 
The orchestra was playing 
See the cuties in their party clothes 
Oh it's getting warm 
Off the shoulder cut into the hip 
Like a uniform 
Did you think I'd want to tow the line 
Well now the line is broken 
Refuse to dance 
Refuse to dance 
Refuse to dance 
Refuse to dance 
You said you're such a pretty thing 
You could make a mark 
I'll teach you all the steps you'll need 
Guide you through the dark 
Suddenly I tought I knew the song 
The orchestra was playing 
Refuse to dance 
Refuse to dance 
Refuse to dance 
Refuse to dance 
See how they follow 
You say jump. They jump 
You say turn. They turn 
Look back in sorrow 
I won't be there 
Refuse to dance 
Refuse to dance 
Refuse to dance 
Refuse to dance
