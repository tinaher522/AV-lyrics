<song artist="Celine_Dion" title="What_A_Wonderful_World">
(Thank you...so very much! I would like... on behalf of all the dancers, the musicians, the singers, the technicians...
people you didn't even see during the show tonight, who are part of this amazing family! I want you to know that we loved performing for you... I loved singing for you... you were a great audience! Thank you very much!)
I see trees of green... red roses too
I see them bloom... for me and for you
And I think to myself... what a wonderful world.
I see skies of blue... and clouds of white
Bright blessed days.... dark sacred nights
And I think to myself... what a wonderful world.
The colors of a rainbow... so pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces... of people going by
I see friends shaking hands.....sayin'.. how do you do?
They're really sayin'... I love you.
I hear babies cry... I watch them grow
They'll learn much more... than I'll never know
And I think to myself... what a wonderful world
Yes, I think to myself... what a wonderful world... oh yeah!
