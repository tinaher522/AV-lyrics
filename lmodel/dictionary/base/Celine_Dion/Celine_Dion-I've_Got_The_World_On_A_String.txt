<song artist="Celine_Dion" title="I've_Got_The_World_On_A_String">
I've got the world on a string 
Sitting on a rainbow 
Got the string around my finger 
What a world, what a life - I'm in love
I've got a song that I sing 
I can make the rain go 
Any time I move my finger 
Lucky me, can't you see - I'm in love
Life's is a beautiful thing 
As long as I hold the string 
I'd be a silly so-and-so 
If I should ever let it go
I've got the world on a string 
Sitting on a rainbow 
Got the string around my finger 
What a world, what a life - I'm in love
Life's is a beautiful thing 
As long as I hold the string 
I'd be a silly so-and-so 
If I should ever let it go 
I've got the world on a string 
Sitting on a rainbow 
Got the string around my finger 
What a World  Aww Man This Is The Life 
Hey Now  I'm So In Love
