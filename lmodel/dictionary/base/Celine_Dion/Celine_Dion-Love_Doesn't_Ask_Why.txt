<song artist="Celine_Dion" title="Love_Doesn't_Ask_Why">
Love doesn't ask why 
It speaks from the heart 
And never explains 
Don't you know that 
Love doesn't think twice 
It can come all at once 
Or whisper from a distance 
Don't ask me if this feeling's right or wrong 
It doesn't have to make much sense 
It just has to be this strong 
'Cause when you're in my arms I understand 
We don't have a voice 
When our hearts make the choices 
There's no plan 
It's not in our hands 
Love doesn't ask why 
It speaks from the heart 
And never explains 
Don't you know that 
Love doesn't think twice 
It can come all at once 
Or whisper from a distance 
Now I can feel what you're afraid to say 
If you give your soul to me 
Will you give too much away 
But we can't let this moment pass us by 
Can't question this chance 
Or expect any answers 
We can try 
Baby we can try
Love doesn't ask why 
It speaks from the heart 
And never explains 
Don't you know that 
Love doesn't think twice 
It can come all at once 
Or whisper from a distance 
So let's take what we found 
And wrap it around us 
Love doesn't ask you why 
It speaks from the heart 
Don't you know,Don't you know that love
Baby,Love doesn't ask why
(Love doesn't ask you why)
Speaks from the heart
And never explains
(And never explains)
Don't you know that love, love, love
(Doesn't think twice)
Doesn't think twice
Comes all at once
(Whispers from a distance)
Whispers from a distance
Love doesn't ask you why
