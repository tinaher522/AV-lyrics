<song artist="Celine_Dion" title="The_Greatest_Reward">
So suddenly, so strange
Life wakes you up, things change
I've done my best, I've served my call
I thought I had it all
So suddenly, so strong
My prejudice was gone
You needed me, I found my place
I'm different now, these days
Now the greatest reward
Is the light in your eyes
The sound of your voice
And the touch of your hand
You made me who I am
You trusted me to grow
I gave my heart to show
There's nothing else I cherish more
I stand by you for sure
Now the greatest reward
Is the love that I can give
I'm here for you now
For as long as I live
You made me who I am
So suddenly, so strange
It's clear to me, things change
Our future lies in here and now
We made it through somehow
Now the greatest reward
Is the love that I can give
I'm here for you now
For as long as I live
You made me who I am
You made me who I am
