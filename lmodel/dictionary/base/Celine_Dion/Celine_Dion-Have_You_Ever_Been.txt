<song artist="Celine_Dion" title="Have_You_Ever_Been">
Have you ever been in love?
You could touch the moonlight
When your heart is shooting stars
You're holding heaven in your arms
Have you ever been so in love?
Have you ever walked on air?
Ever felt like you were dreamin'
When you never thought it could
But it really feels that good
Have you ever been so in love?
Have you ever been in love?
You could touch the moonlight
When your heart is shooting stars
You're holding heaven in your arms
Have you ever been in love, have you?
The time I spent
Waiting for something that was heaven sent
When you find it don't let go
I know
Have you ever said a prayer?
And found that it was answered
All my hope has been restored
And I ain't looking anymore
Have you ever been so in love, have you? Haa
Some place that you ain't leavin'
Somewhere you're gonna stay
When you finally found the meanin'
Have you ever felt this way?
The time I spent
Waiting for something that was heaven sent
When you find it, don't let go
I know
'Coz have you ever been in love, so in loveÂ ?
You can touch the moonlight
You can even reach the stars
Doesn't matter near or far
Have you ever been so in love
Say it
'Cause have you ever been in love?
Have you ever been in love?
So in love
