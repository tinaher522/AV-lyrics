<song artist="Celine_Dion" title="Stand_By_Your_Side">
I cry and you comfort me 
I'm lost and you hear my scream 
So its.. 
Hard to watch you fallin 
When you run so deep in me 
You live in me 
Gonna stand by your side now 
Lemme kiss all your tears away 
You can stay in my arms now 
And I know I can make you believe 
Again… 
I walk but you can run though fire 
I search for reasons and baby you inspire 
But I … I know somebody hurt you 
And I know you really need a friend 
Well you can take my hand 
Gonna stand by your side now 
Lemme kiss all your tears away 
You can stay in my arms now 
And I know I can make you believe 
Again… 
When you feel like you can't go on 
Don't you know you'll never walk alone 
You live in me 
Gonna stand by your side now 
Lemme kiss all your tears away 
You can stay in my arms now 
And I know I can make you believe 
Again… 
I'm gonna stand (oawww) 
Stand by your side (oooooo) 
Kiss all your tears (I wanna stand) 
Away tonight (I wanna stand by your side) 
I'm gonna stand (gonna look in your eyes) 
stand by your side 
make you believe (see ya smiling) 
again (see ya smiling) 
see ya smiling again
