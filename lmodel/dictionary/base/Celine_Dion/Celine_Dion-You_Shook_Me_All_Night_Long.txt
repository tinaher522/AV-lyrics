<song artist="Celine_Dion" title="You_Shook_Me_All_Night_Long">
He was a fast machine
He kept his motor clean
He was the best damn man I had ever seen
He had the sightless eyes
Telling me no lies
Knockin' me out with those American thighs
Taking more than he share
Had me fightin' for air
He told me to come but I was already there
'Cause the walls were shakin'
The earth was quakin'
My mind was achin'
And we were makin' it and you
Shook me all night long
C'mon girlfriend
Oh yeah
Shook me
Said you shook me all night long
Oooh shook me
Workin' double time
On the seduction line
He was one of a kind, he's just mine all mine
Wanted no applause
Just another course
He made a meal out of me and came back for more
Had to cool me down
To take another round
Now I'm back in the ring to take another swing
Now the walls were shakin'
The earth was quakin'
My mind was achin'
And we were makin' it and you

[C'mon]
Shook me all night long
C'mon girlfriend, shook me
Ooooooooh you
Shook me all night long
Everybody sing with me
You shook me all night long
Oooh
Shook me, shook me baby
You shook me all night long
Shook me
C'mon
I said, you shook ma all night long
Oooooooh oooooh you
Shook me all night long
You, you, you
Shook me all night long
You
Shook me baby you
Shook me all night long
Yeah, you shook me, you shook me
Oooooh, you shook me, you shook me, you shook me, you shook me
