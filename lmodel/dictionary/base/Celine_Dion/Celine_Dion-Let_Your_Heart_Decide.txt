<song artist="Celine_Dion" title="Let_Your_Heart_Decide">
I understand that you've met someone
With a perfect heart
But you've been questioned by everyone
So you're in the dark
Can you choose to fall
Should you risk it all
How am I gonna stop it if you wanna give it all to love
When I'm on your side
And I understand you're the only one to know
Whether wrong or right
Let your heart decide 
Some may tell you don't take the risk
It's a waste of time
But if you think you'll find happiness
Baby take the dive
It's unusual
But it's critical
How am I gonna stop it if you wanna give it all to love
When I'm on your side
And I understand you're the only one to know
Whether wrong or right
Let your heart decide 
Give it up
How am I gonna stop it if you wanna give it all to love
When I'm on your side
And I understand you're the only one to know
Whether wrong or right
Let your heart decide 
You're the only one
