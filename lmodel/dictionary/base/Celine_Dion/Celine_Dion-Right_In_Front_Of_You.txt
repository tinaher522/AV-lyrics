<song artist="Celine_Dion" title="Right_In_Front_Of_You">
It can twist your heart
Put you in the dark
I was cold and lonely
Doubt
It can close you in
Build the walls within
I let fear control me
I let go
Didn't know
Where the answer would be
Right in front of you
Right in front of me
We were looking
For somehow, some way
We couldn't see
That the love was always there
It's been around us everywhere
I had to fall to finally see
That you were right in front of me
Faith
It can lift you up
And we've got enough
To reach a new beginning
Love
Can withstand a storm
In the final hour
We'll find the joy in living
Don't let go
'Cause I know
Pretty soon you will see, yeah
Right in front of you
Right in front of me
We were looking
For somehow, some way
We couldn't see
That the love was always there
It's been around us everywhere
I had to fall to finally see
That you were right in front of me
You are my tomorrow
There's safety in your arms
Where you go, I'll follow
'Cause you're the world where I belong
Right in front of you
In front of me
Somehow we couldn't see
Right in front of you
I had to fall to finally see
Right in front of you
Right in front of me
We were looking
For somehow, some way
We couldn't see
That the love was always there
It's been around us everywhere
I had to fall to finally see
Right in front of you
Right in front of me
We were looking
For somehow, some way
We couldn't see
That the love was always there
It's been around us everywhere
I had to fall to finally see
That you were right in front of me
I finally see
I had to fall to finally see
That you were right in front of me
