<song artist="Celine_Dion" title="Misled">
I thought I knew you
Thought that I knew you well
We had a rhythm but I guess you never can tell
Oh, I learned early never to ignore the signs
You'll be forgiven
It ain't worth that much, to my mind
Lovin' you, so easy
It's hard to say goodbye
But if that's the way it goes, it goes
Just a page in my history
Just another one of those mysteries
One more lover that used to be
If you think you're in my head
You've been seriously misled
Seriously misled
Lovin' somebody ain't your average 9-to-5
It takes conviction
It takes a will to survive
I'm not somebody who commits a crime
And then leaves the scene
But when I've been dissed
I don't spend much time on "what might have been"
I'm not about self-pity
Your love did me wrong
Now I'm moving, moving on, yeah
Just a page in my history
Just another one of those mysteries
One more lover that used to be
If you think you're in my head
You've been seriously misled
Seriously misled
I'll get on with my life
And you're not on my mind
I'm not too close to time
To get over you
I'm not about self-pity
Your love did me wrong
So I'm moving, moving on
Just a page in my history
Just another one of those mysteries
(Just another page!)
One more lover that used to be
If you think you're in my head
You're seriously misled
Just a page in my history
Just another one of those mysteries
One more lover that used to be
If you think it, baby
Think it, baby
Think it, baby
Oh yeah
Just a page in my history
Just another one of those mysteries
One more lover that used to be
If you think you're in my head
You've been seriously misled
