<song artist="Celine_Dion" title="Ave_Maria">
Ave Maria! 
Maiden mild! 
Oh, listen to a maiden's prayer 
For thou can't hear amid the wild 
This thou, this thou can't save amid, despair 
We slumbers safely tear the Mother 
Though we be man outcast relived 
Oh, Maiden, hear a maiden's sorrow 
Oh, Mother, hear a suppliant child! 
Ave Maria 
Ave Maria, gratia plena 
Maria, gratia plena 
Mari,a gratia plena 
Ave, ave dominus 
Dominus tecum 
The murky cavern's air so heavy 
Shall breath of balm if thou hast smiled 
Oh, Maiden, hear a maiden pleadin' 
Oh, Mother, hear a suppliant child 
Ave Maria 
Ave Maria
