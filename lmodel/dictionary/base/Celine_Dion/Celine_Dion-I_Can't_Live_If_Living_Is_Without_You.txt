<song artist="Celine_Dion" title="I_Can't_Live_If_Living_Is_Without_You">
No I can't forget this evening 
Or your face as you were leaving
But I guess that's just the way the story goes
You always smile but in your eyes the sorrow showsyes it shows
No, I can't forget tomorrowwhen I think of all my sorrow
When I had you there, but then I let you go
And now it's only fair that I should let you know what you should know
I can't live, If living is without you I can't live, I can't give anymore!
Can't live, if living is without you, 
Can't give, I can't give anymore!
No I can't forget this evening or your face as you were leaving
But I guess that's just the way the story goes 
You always smile but in your eyes
Your sorrow shows yes it shows
I can't live if living is without you! I can't live, I can't give anymore!
I can't live if living is without you! I can't give, I can't give anymore!
I can't live if living is without you! I can't give, I can't give anymore!
Can't live, if living is without you 
Can't give, can't give any more!
No, I can't forget this evenng or your face as you were leaving
But I guess that's just the way the story goes...
OUI?
