<song artist="Celine_Dion" title="I_Want_You_To_Need_Me">
I want to be the face you see when you close your eyes
I want to be the touch you need every single night
I want to be your fantasy
And be your reality
And everything between
I want you to need me
Like the air you breathe
I want you to feel me
In everything
I want you to see me
In your every dream
The way that I taste you feel you breathe you need you
I want you to need me
Like I need you
I want to be the eyes that look deep into your soul
I want to be the world to you
I just want it all
I want to be your deepest kiss
The answer to your every wish
I'm all you ever need
I want you to need me
Like the air you breathe
I want you to feel me
In everything
I want you to see me
In your every dream
The way that I taste you feel you breathe you need you
I want you to need me
'Cause I need you
More than you could know
And I need you
To never never let me go
And I need to be deep inside your heart
I just want to be everywhere you are
I want to be the face you see when you close your eyes
I want to be the touch you need every single night
I want to be your fantasy
And be your reality
And everything between...
I want you to need me
Like the air you breathe
I want you to feel me
In everything
I want you to see me
In your every dream
'Cause baby I taste you feel you breathe you need you
I want you to need me
Like the air you breathe
I want you to feel me
In your everything
I want you to see me
In your every dream
'Cause baby I taste you feel you breathe you need you
I want you to need me
Like I need you
Like I need you
Like I need you
