<song artist="Celine_Dion" title="Live_For_The_One_You_Love">
A million stars light
This beautiful night
This is not a night to die
Let me sing and dance
Beneath the sky
I have such love to give, to give
I want a chance to live
Live, for the one I love
Love, as no one has loved
Give, asking nothing in return
Free, free to find my way
Free to have my say
Free to see the day
Live, like I used to be
Like a wild but free
Full of life in me
Live, for the one I love
Love, as no one has loved
Give, asking nothing in return
Though this world tears us apart
We're still together in my heart
I want the world to hear my cry
And even if I have to die
Love will not die, love will change the world
Live, for the one I love
Love, as no one has loved
Give, asking nothing in return
And love until love wears me away
I'll die and I know my love will stay
And I'll know, I know my love will stay
