<song artist="Celine_Dion" title="At_Last">
At last
My love has come along
My lonely days are over
And life is like a song
At last
The Skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped up in clover
The night I looked at you
I found a dream, that I could speak to
A dream that I, can call my own
I found a thrill, to press my cheek to
A thrill that I, have never known
Oh, yeah
You smiled, you smiled
And then the spell was cast
And here we are in heaven
For you are mine at last
I found a dream
That I could speak to
A dream that I can call my own
I found a thrill, to press my cheek to
A thrill that I have never known
You smiled you smiled
And then the spell was cast
And here we are in heaven
For you are mine
At last
At last
At last
