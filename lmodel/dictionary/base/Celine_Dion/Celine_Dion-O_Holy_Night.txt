<song artist="Celine_Dion" title="O_Holy_Night">
O Holy night, the stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
Til He appeared and the soul felt it's worth
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn
Fall on your knees
O hear the angel voices
O night divine!
O night when Christ was born
O night divine!
O night, O night divine!
Truly He taught us to love one another
His law is love and His gospel is peace
Chains shall He break for the slave is our brother,
And in His Name, all oppression shall cease
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we
With all within, let's praise his holy name:
Christ is the Lord!
His name forever praise we
Noel, Noel, and
O night, O night Divine
Noel, Noel
O night, O night Divine
Noel, Noel
O night, O holy Night
O Holy night, the stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth
