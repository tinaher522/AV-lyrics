<song artist="Celine_Dion" title="That's_Just_A_Woman_In_Me">
If your shoes refuse to shine
And your legs don't walk in line
And tomorrow's just some other time, yeah
That's just the woman in me, baby
That's just the woman in me, baby
That's just the woman workin' on you
And if your feet can't find the floor
And your key won't fit the door
And you've forgotten that two 2's are four, yeah
That's just the woman in me, baby
That's just the woman in me, baby, yeah
That's just the woman workin' on you
Oh, oh yeah, now
And I've seen you wanderin' baby
Up and down my street, yeah
Try to explain that love is pain
To all the people that you meet
Searchin' for that imperious
Mysterious femme fatale kind of stuff, yeah
But if you don't know by now that it's me anyhow
And that baby, you've got it rough
So if your prayin' gets so confused
And your TV is blowin' a fuse
Just come on over, you've got nothin' to lose
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
That's just the woman in me, baby
That's just the woman in me, baby, yeah
That's just the woman workin' on you
Workin' on you, oh, yeah
Workin' on you, oh, yeah
Workin' on you, oh
'Cause I need, yeah, I need a man to love me
Because I need, yeah, I need a man to love, yeah
Oh, respect me, protect me, rollover, turnover
Runaway to other towers, buy me a bunch of flowers and love
That's the woman in me, baby, yeah
Workin' on you, oh, yeah
Workin' on you, oh, yeah
Workin' on you, oh, yeah
Workin' on you, oh, oh, oh, oh
Workin' on you, oh, yeah
I need a man to love, oh, yeah
I need a man to love, oh, yeah
