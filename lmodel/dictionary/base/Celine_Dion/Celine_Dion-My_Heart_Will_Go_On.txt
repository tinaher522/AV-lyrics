<song artist="Celine_Dion" title="My_Heart_Will_Go_On">
Every night in my dreams
I see you, I feel you
That is how I know you go on
Far across the distance
And spaces between us
You have come to show you go on
Near, far
Wherever you are
I believe that the heart does go on
Once more
You open the door
And you're here in my heart
And my heart will go on and on
Love can touch us one time
And last for a lifetime
And never let go till we're gone
Love was when I loved you
One true time I hold to
In my life we'll always go on
Near, far
Wherever you are
I believe that the heart does go on
Once more
You open the door
And you're here in my heart
And my heart will go on and on, ooh
You're here
There's nothing I fear
And I know that my heart will go on
We'll sit forever with the swan
You are safe in my heart
And my heart will go on and on
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
