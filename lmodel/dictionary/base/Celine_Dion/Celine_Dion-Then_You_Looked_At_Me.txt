<song artist="Celine_Dion" title="Then_You_Looked_At_Me">
Laugh and cry, live and die,
Life is a dream we are dreaming
Day by day, I find my way
Look for the soul and the meaning
[Chorus]
Then you look at me and I always see
What I have been searching for
I'm lost as can be, then you look at me
And I am not lost anymore
People run, sun to sun
Caught in their lives ever-flowing
Once begun, life goes till its gone
We have to go where its going
[Chorus]
Then you look at me and I always see
What I have been searching for
I'm lost as can be, then you look at me
And I am not lost anymore
And you say you see when you look at me
The reason you love life so
Though lost I have been
I find love again
And life just keeps on runnin'
And life just keeps on running
You look at me and life comes from you
From you
