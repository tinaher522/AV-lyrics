<song artist="Celine_Dion" title="The_Show_Must_Go_On">
Empty spaces
What are we living for?
Abandoned places
I guess we know the score
On and on
Does anybody know
what we are looking for?
Another hero
Another mindless crime
Behind the curtain
In the pantomime
Hold the line
Does anybody want
To take it anymore?
The show must go on
The show must go on
Yeah
Ooh, inside my heart is breaking
My makeup may be flaking
But my smiles still stays on
Whatever happens
I'll leave it all to chance
Another heartache
Another failed romance
On and on
Does anybody know 
Qhat we are living for?
I guess I'm learning (I'm learning, learning, learning)
I must be warmer now
I'll soon be turning (turning, turning, turning)
Round the corner now
Outside the dawn is breaking
But inside in the dark
I'm aching to be free
The show must go on, yeah
The show must go on, yeah
Ooh, inside my heart is breaking
My makeup may be flaking
But my smile still stays on
Yeah
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, oh
My soul is painted
Like the wings of butterflies
Fairytales of yesterday 
Will grow but never die
I can fly, my friends
The show must go on, yeah
The show must go on, yeah, yeah
I'll face it with a grin
I'm never giving in
On, with the show
Ooh, I'll top the bill
I'll overkill
I have to find the will
To carry on
(On with the)
(On with the) show
The show must go on
