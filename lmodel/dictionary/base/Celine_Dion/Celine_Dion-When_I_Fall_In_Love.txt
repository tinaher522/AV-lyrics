<song artist="Celine_Dion" title="When_I_Fall_In_Love">
When I fall in love,
It will be forever,
Or I'll never fall in love.
In a restless world,
Like this is
Love is ended before its begun
And too many moonlight kisses
Seem to cool in the warmth of the sun.
When I give my heart
It will be completely
Or I'll never give my heart (oo let me give my heart)
And the moment I can feel that you feel that way too
(I feel that way too)
Is when I'll fall in love
(I'll fall in love)
With you
When I fall in love,
It will be forever
Or I'll never fall in love
(oo I'll never never fall in love)
In a restless world like this is
Love is ended before its begun
And too many moonlight kisses
Seem to cool in the warmth of the sun
When I give my heart,
It will be completely
Or I'll never give (I'll never give)
My heart (oo I'll never give my heart)
And the moment I can feel that you feel that way too
Is when I'll fall in love
When I'll fall in love
When I'll fall in love with you.
