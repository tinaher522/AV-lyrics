<song artist="Celine_Dion" title="Calling_You">
A desert road from Vegas to nowhere
Some place better than where you've been
A coffee machine that needs some fixing
In a little caf√© just around the bend
I am calling you
Can't you hear me
I am calling you
A hot dry wind blows right thru me
The baby's crying and can't sleep
But we both know a change in coming
Coming close sweet release
I am calling you
I know you hear me
I am calling you Oh
</song>
