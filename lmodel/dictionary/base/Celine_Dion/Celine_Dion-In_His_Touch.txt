<song artist="Celine_Dion" title="In_His_Touch">
Forgive me, don't know where to start. 
I guess we've come to, the serious part. 
I need to find out, if there's a chance for us. 
Don't give me that same old look, you won't win me over. 
Don't give me that same old speech, you don't have to speak at all. 
You can say you love me, that I'm your perfect crush. 
How it hurts to need someone that much. 
You can swear you mean it, but that ain't good enough. 
Coz when a man loves a woman, it is all... In His Touch 
I wish you could see. Yeah... 
Just how simple, it's supposed to be. 
Coz now that we've come this far, we don't want to lose it. No. 
If you wanna win my heart, baby just shut your mouth. 
You can say you love me, that I'm your perfect crush. 
How it hurts to need someone that much. 
You can swear you mean it, but that ain't good enough. 
Coz when a man loves a woman, it is all... In His Touch 
Then words don't mean, that much. 
You can say you love me, that I'm your perfect crush. 
How it hurts to need someone that much. 
You can swear you mean it, but that ain't good enough. 
Coz when a man loves a woman, it is all... In His Touch.
