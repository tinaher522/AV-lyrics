<song artist="Sting" title="All_Four_Seasons">
With her smile as sweet as
A warm wind in summer
She's got me flying like a bird
In a bright June sky
And then just when she thinks that
I've got her number
Brings me down to the ground
With her wintry eye
That's my baby
She can be all four seasons in one day
And when the nighttime comes
With no interference
To our warm summer love
With all its charms
Just like a thoroughbred horse
She can turn on a sixpence
And I find that I'm back in
Mistress Winter's arms
That's my baby
She can be all four seasons in one day
How will I know?
How can I tell?
Which side of the bed she takes when the day begins
She can be kind
She can be cruel
She's got me guessing like a game-show fool
She can change her mind
Like she changes her sweaters
From one minute to the next
It's hard to tell
She blows hot and cold
Just like stormy weather
She's my gift from the Lord
Or a fiend from hell
That's my baby
She can be all four seasons in one day
Watching the weatherman's
Been no good at all
Winter, spring, summer
I'm bound for a fall
No long-term predictions for my baby
She can be all four seasons in one day
How will I know?
How can I tell?
Which side of the bed she takes when the day begins
She can be kind
She can be cruel
She's got me guessing like a game-show fool
If it's a sunny day I take my umbrella
Just in case the raindrops start to fall
You could say that I'm just a cautious fellow
I don't want to be caught in a sudden squall
That's my baby
She can be all four seasons in one day
That's my baby
She can be all four seasons in one day
