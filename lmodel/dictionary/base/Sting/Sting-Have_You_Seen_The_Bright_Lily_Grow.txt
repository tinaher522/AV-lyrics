<song artist="Sting" title="Have_You_Seen_The_Bright_Lily_Grow">
Have you seen the bright lily grow
Before rude hands have touched it?
Have you marked the fall of the snow
Before the earth hath smutched it?
Have you felt the wool of beaver,
Or swan's down ever?
Or have smelt o' the bud o' the brier,
Or the nard in the fire?
Or have tasted the bag of the bee?
O so white, O so soft, O so sweet is she!
So sweet is she
O so white, O so soft, O so sweet is she
So sweet is she
