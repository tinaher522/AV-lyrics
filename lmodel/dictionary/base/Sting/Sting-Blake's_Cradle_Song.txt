<song artist="Sting" title="Blake's_Cradle_Song">
Sweet dreams, form a shade
O'er my lovely infant's head
Sweet dreams, pleasant streams
Happy silent moony beams
Sweet Sleep, with soft down
Weave thy brows an infant crown
Sweet Sleep, Angel mild
Hover o'er my happy child
Sleep, sleep, happy child
All creation slept and smiled
Sleep, sleep, happy sleep
While o'er thee thy mother weep
Sweet babe, in thy face
Holy image I can trace,
Sweet babe, once like thee
Maker lay and wept for me
Wept for me, for thee, for all
When He was an infant small
Thou His image ever see
Heavenly face that smiles on thee
Smiles on thee, on me, on all
Who became an infant small
Infant smiles are His own smiles
Heaven and earth to peace beguiles
