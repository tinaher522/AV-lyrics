<song artist="Sting" title="In_Darkness_Let_Me_Dwell">
In darkness let me dwell
The ground, the ground shall sorrow, sorrow be
The roof despair to bar all
All cheerful light from me
The walls of marble black
That moistened, that moistened still shall weep
Still shall weep
My music, my music, hellish
Hellish jarring sounds, jarring jarring sounds
To banish, banish friendly sleep
Thus wedded to my woes
And bedded to my tomb
O let me living die
O let me living, let me living, living die
Till death, till death do come
Till death, till death do come
Till death, till death do come
In darkness let me dwell
</song>
