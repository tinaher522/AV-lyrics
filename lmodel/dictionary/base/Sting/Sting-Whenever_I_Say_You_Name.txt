<song artist="Sting" title="Whenever_I_Say_You_Name">
Whenever I say your name
Whenever I call to mind your face
Whatever bread's in my mouth
Whatever the sweetest wine that I taste
Whenever your memory feeds my soul
Whatever got broken becomes whole
Whenever I'm filled with doubts that we will be together
Wherever I lay me down
Wherever I put my head to sleep
Whenever I hurt and cry
Whenever I got to lie awake and weep
Whenever I kneel to pray 
Whenever I need to find a way 
I'm calling out your name
Whenever those dark clouds hide the moon
Whenever this world has gotten so strange
I know that something's gonna change 
Something's gonna change
Whenever I say your name
Whenever I say your name
I'm already praying, I'm already praying
I'm already filled with a joy that I can't explain
Wherever I lay me down
Wherever I rest my weary head to sleep
Whenever I hurt and cry
Whenever I got to lie awake and weep 
Whenever I'm on the floor
Whatever it was that I believed before
Whenever I say your name
Whenever I say it loud, I'm already praying
Whenever this world has got me down 
Whenever I shed a tear
Whenever the TV makes me mad
Whenever I'm paralyzed with fear 
Whenever those dark clouds fill the sky
Whenever I lose the reason why
Whenever I'm filled with doubts that we will be together
Whenever the sun refuses to shine
Whenever the skies are pouring rain
Whatever I lost I thought was mine
Whenever I close my eyes in pain
Whenever I kneel to pray
Whenever I need to find a way
I'm calling out your name
Whenever this dark begins to fall
Whenever I'm vulnerable and small
Whenever I feel like I could die
Whenever I'm holding back the tears that I cry 
Whenever I say your name
Whenever I call to mind your face, I'm already praying
Whatever bread's in my mouth
Whatever the sweetest wine that I taste
Wherever I lay me down
Wherever I rest my weary head to sleep
Whenever I hurt and cry
Whenever I'm forced to lie awake and have to weep 
Whenever I'm on the floor
Whatever it was that I believed before
Whenever I say your name
Whenever I say it loud, I'm already praying
Whenever I say your name
No matter how long it takes
One day we'll be together 
Whenever I say your name
Let there be no mistake
That day will last forever
