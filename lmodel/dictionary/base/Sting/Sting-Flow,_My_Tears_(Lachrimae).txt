<song artist="Sting" title="Flow,_My_Tears_(Lachrimae)">
Flow my tears, fall from your springs,
Exiled forever let me mourn
Where night's black bird her sad infamy sins,
There let me live forlorn
Down, vain lights, shine you no more,
No nights are dark enough for those
That in despair their last fortunes deplore,
Light doth but shame disclose
Never may my woes be relieved,
Since pity is fled,
And tears, and sighs, and groans my weary days,
My weary days of all joys have deprived
From the highest spire of contentment,
My fortune is thrown
And fear, and grief, and pain for my desserts,
For my desserts are my hopes since hope is gone
Hark, you shadows, that in darkness dwell,
Learn to contemn light,
Happy, happy they that in hell
Feel not the world's despite
Hark, you shadows, that in darkness dwell,
Learn to contemn light,
Happy, happy they that in hell
Feel not the world's despite
