spoken:
Right Honorable, as I have been most bound unto your honor, so I most humbly desire your honor to pardon my boldness, and make my choice of your honor to let you understand my bounden duty and desire of God's preservation of my most dear sovereign Queen and country, whom I beseech God ever to bless and to confound all their enemies what and whomsoever. Your honor's most bounden for ever, John Dowland.
