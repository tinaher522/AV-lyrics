<song artist="Sting" title="And_Yet">
This town, this stain on the sunrise
Disguised in the mist this morning
It's 8 AM
A seagull shouts a sailor's warning
This sky, this bend in the river
Slows down and delivers me
The tide rolls back
And all my memories fade to black
And yet, and yet...I'm back
This town has a strange magnetic pull
Like a homing signal in your skull
And you sail by the stars
Of the hemisphere
Wondering how in the hell
Did ye end up here
It's like an underground river
Or a hidden stream
That flows through your head
And haunts your dreams
And you stuffed those dreams
In this canvas sack
And there's nothing 'round here
That the wide world lacks
And yet, and yet...you're back
Some nights I'd lie on the deck and I'd stare
At the turning of the stars
Those constellations hanging up there
From the cables and the rigging
I'd wonder if she saw the same
Or managed to recall my name
Why would she ever think of me
Some boy she loved who fled to sea
And why waste time debating
Whether she'd be waiting
For the likes of me
So ye drift into port
With the scum of the seas
To the dance halls and the brothels
Where you took your ease
And the ship's left the dock
But you're half past caring
And you haven't got a clue
Whose bed you're sharing
And your head's like a hammer
On a bulkhead door
And it feels like somebody
Might have broken your jaw
And there's bloodstains and glass
All over the floor
And ye swear to God ye'll drink no more
And yet, and yet...
In truth
It's too late to find her
Too late to remind her at some garden gate
Where a servant tells me I should wait
And perhaps a door's slammed in my face
My head must be in outer space
And yet, and yet
Before this sun has set
Before the sea
There may be something else that's waiting for
The likes of me
This town, this stain on the sunrise...
