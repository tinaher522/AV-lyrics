<song artist="Sting" title="King_Of_Pain">
There's a little black spot on the sun today
It's the same old thing as yesterday
There's a black hat caught in a high tree top
There's a flag-pole rag and the wind won't stop
I have stood here before inside the pouring rain
With the world turning circles running 'round my brain
I guess I'm always hoping that you'll end this reign
It's my destiny to be the king of pain
There's a little black spot on the sun today
It's the same old thing as yesterday
There's a black hat caught in a high tree top
There's a flag-pole rag and the wind won't stop
I have stood here before inside the pouring rain
With the world turning circles running 'round my brain
I guess I'm always hoping that you'll end this reign
It's my destiny to be the king of pain
There's a fossil that's trapped in a high cliff wall
There's a dead salmon frozen in a waterfall
There's a blue whale beached by a springtime's ebb
There's a butterfly trapped in a spider's web
I have stood here before inside the pouring rain
With the world turning circles running 'round my brain
Guess I'm always hoping that you'll end this reign
It's my destiny to be the king of pain
There's a king on a throne with his eyes torn out
There's a blind man looking for a shadow of doubt
There's a rich man sleeping on a golden bed
There's a skeleton choking on a crust of bread
King of pain, king of pain
There's a red fox torn by a huntsman's pack
There's a black-winged gull with a broken back
There's a little black spot on the sun today
It's the same old thing as yesterday
I have stood here before in the pouring rain
With the world turning circles running 'round my brain
Guess I always thought you could end this reign
It's my destiny to be the king of pain
King of pain, king of pain
king of pain, king of pain
I'll always be, I'll always be
I'll always be, I'll always be
I'll always be, I'll always be
I'll always, always, always, always, always be
King of pain, king of pain
king of pain, king of pain
king of pain, king of pain
king of pain, king of pain
