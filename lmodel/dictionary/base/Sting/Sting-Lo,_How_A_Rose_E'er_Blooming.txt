<song artist="Sting" title="Lo,_How_A_Rose_E'er_Blooming">
Lo, how a rose e'er blooming
From tender stem hath sprung
Of Jesse's lineage coming
As men of old have sung
It came a flow'ret bright
Amid the cold of winter
When half-spent was the night
Isaiah 'twas foretold it
This rose that I have in mind
And with Mary we behold it
The Virgin Mother so sweet and so kind
To show God's love aright
She bore to men a Saviour
When half-spent was the night
To show God's love aright
She bore to men a Saviour
When half-spent was the night
