<song artist="Sting" title="One_World_(Not_Three)">
One world is enough, for all of us
One world is enough, for all of us
It's a subject we rarely mention
But when we do we have this little invention
By pretending they're a different world from me
I show my responsibility
One world is enough, for all of us
One world is enough, for all of us
The Third World breathes our air tomorrow
We live on the time we borrow
In our world there's no time for sorrow
In their world there is no tomorrow
One world is enough, for all of us
One world is enough, for all of us
Lines are drawn upon the world
Before we get our flags unfurled
Whichever one we pick
It's just a self-deluding trick
One world is enough, for all of us
One world is enough, for all of us
I don't want to bring a sour note
Remember this before you vote
We can all sink or we all float
'Cause we're all in the same big boat
One world is enough for all of us
One world is enough for all of us
One world is enough for all of us
One world is enough for all of us
It may seem a million miles away
But it gets a little closer every day
It may seem a million miles away
But it gets a little closer every day
