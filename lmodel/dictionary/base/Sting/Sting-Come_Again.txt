<song artist="Sting" title="Come_Again">
Come again,
Sweet love doth now invite 
Thy graces that refrain 
To do me due delight
To see, to hear, to touch, to kiss, to die, 
With thee again in sweetest sympathy
To see, to hear, to touch, to kiss, to die, 
With thee again in sweetest sympathy
Come again,
That I may cease to mourn 
Through thy unkind disdain
For now left and forlorn
I sit, I sigh, I weep, I faint, I die 
In deadly pain and endless misery
I sit, I sigh, I weep, I faint, I die 
In deadly pain and endless misery
All the day,
The sun that lends me shine 
By frowns do cause me pine 
And feeds me with delay
Her smiles, my springs, that makes my joys to grow, 
Her frowns the winters of my woe
Her smiles, my springs, that makes my joys to grow, 
Her frowns the winters of my woe
All the night,
My sleeps are full of dreams
My eyes are full of streams
My heart takes no delight
