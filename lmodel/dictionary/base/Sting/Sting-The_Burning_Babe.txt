<song artist="Sting" title="The_Burning_Babe">
As I in hoary winter's night stood shivering in the snow
Surprised I was with sudden heat which made my heart to glow
And lifting up a fearful eye to view what fire was near
A pretty babe all burning bright did in the air appear
Who scorched with excessive heat such floods of tears did shed
As though His floods should quench His flames
Which with His tears were fed
Alas, quoth He, but newly born in fiery heats I fry
Yet none approach to warm their hearts or feel my fire but I
My faultless breast the furnace is, the fuel, wounding thorns
Love is the fire and sighs the smoke the ashes, shames, and scorns
The fuel justice layeth on and mercy blows the coals
The metal in this furnace wrought are men's defiled souls
For which as now on fire I am to work them to their good
So will I melt into a bath to wash them in my blood
With this He vanished out of sight and swiftly shrunk away
And straight I called unto mind that it was Christmas Day
