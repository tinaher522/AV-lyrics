<song artist="Sting" title="You_Only_Cross_My_Mind_In_Winter">
Always this winter child
December sun sits low against the sky
Cold light on frozen fields
The cattle in their stable lowing
When two walked this winter road
Ten thousand miles seemed nothing to us then
One walks with heavy tread
The space between their footsteps slowing
All day the snow did fall
What's left of the day is close drawn in
I speak your name as if you'd answer me
But the silence of the snow is deafening
How well do I recall our arguments
Our logic owed no debts or recompense
Philosophy and faith were ghosts that we would chase until
The gates of heaven were broken
But something makes me turn, I don't know
To see another's footsteps there in the snow
I smile to myself and then I wonder why it is
You only cross my mind in winter
