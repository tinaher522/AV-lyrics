<song artist="Sting" title="Now_Winter_Comes_Slowly">
Now winter comes slowly, pale, meager, and old
First trembling with age and then quivering with cold
Benumed with hard frost and with snow covered o'er
Benumed with hard frost and with snow covered o'er
Prays the sun to restore him
Prays the sun to restore him and sings as before
