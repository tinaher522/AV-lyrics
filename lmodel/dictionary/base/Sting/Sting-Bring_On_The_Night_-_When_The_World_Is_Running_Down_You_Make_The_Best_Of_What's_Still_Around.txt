<song artist="Sting" title="Bring_On_The_Night_-_When_The_World_Is_Running_Down_You_Make_The_Best_Of_What's_Still_Around">
The afternoon has gently passed me by
The evening spreads itself against the sky
Waiting for tomorrow, it's just another day
'Cause I bid yesterday good-bye
Bring on the night
I couldn't spend another hour of daylight
Bring on the night
I couldn't stand another hour of daylight
The future is but a question mark
Hangs above my head there in the dark
Can't see for the brightness staring me blind
'Cause I bid yesterday good-bye
Bring on the night
I couldn't spend another hour of daylight
Bring on the night
I couldn't stand another hour of daylight
Bring on the night
I couldn't spend another hour of daylight
Bring on the night
I couldn't stand another hour of daylight
Bring on the night, bring on the night...
Turn on my VCR, same one I've had for years
James Brown on The T.A.M.I. Show, same tape I've had for years
I sit in my old car, same one I've had for years
Old battery's running down, it ran for years and years
Turn on the radio, the static hurts my ears
Tell me where would I go, I ain't been out in years
Turn on the stereo, it's played for years and years
An Otis Redding song, it's all I own
When the world is running down
You make the best of what's still around
When the world is running down
You make the best of what's still around
When I feel lonely here, don't waste my time with tears
I run Deep Throat again, it ran for years and years
Don't like the food I eat, the cans are running out
Same food for years and years, I hate the food I eat
When the world is running down
You make the best of what's still around
When the world is running down
You make the best of what's still around
When the world (when the world)
Is running down, down, down (is running down, down, down)
You make the best of it (You make the best of it)
What's still around, yeah (What's still around, yeah)
When the world (when the world)
Is running down, down, down (is running down, down, down)
You make the best of it (you make the best of it)
What's still around, yeah (what's still around, yeah)
We five black guys that don't take the time
This is the way we break down the line
His name is not called with the most finesse
'Cause he can do it really good, he can do it the best
Playin' up with Darryl Jones is on the bass
Playin' funky, funky grooves all over the place
Playin' Omar Hakim all nice and neat
He can hang it down with the funky, funky beat
Dolette M. and Janice P.
Playin' background vocals for you and me
Playin' everybody's got to get goin' with the thing
For the man for the night, it's Sting, it's Sting
Wave your hands in the air
And wave 'em like you just don't care
They be gettin' down with Sting sounds
Everybody say "oh yeah" (Oh yeah)
Oh yeah (Oh yeah)
Oh yeah (Oh yeah)
Oh yeah (Oh yeah)
Oh yeah (Oh yeah)
You don't stop
Say it, one for the money, two for The Police
Come on everybody, let's rock this place
Put your hands together, y'all
Let's break: that's Sting
Hit it
Turn on my VCR, same one I've had for years
James Brown on The T.A.M.I. Show, same tape I've had for years
I sit in my old car, same one I've had for years
Old battery's running down, it ran for years and years
Turn on the radio, the static hurts my ears
Tell me where would I go, I ain't been out in years
Turn on the stereo, it's played for years and years
An Otis Redding song, it's all I own
When the world is running down
You make the best of what's still around
When the world is running down
You make the best of what's still around
When the world is running down
You make the best of what's still around
When the world is running down
You make the best of what's still around
