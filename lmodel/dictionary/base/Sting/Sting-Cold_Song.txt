<song artist="Sting" title="Cold_Song">
What power art thou who from below
Hast made me rise unwillingly and slow
From beds of everlasting snow
See'st thou not how stiff, how stiff and wondrous old
Far, far unfit to bear the bitter cold
I can scarcely move or draw my breath
I can scarcely move or draw my breath
Let me, let me, let me freeze again
Let me, let me freeze again to death
Let me, let me, let me freeze again to death
