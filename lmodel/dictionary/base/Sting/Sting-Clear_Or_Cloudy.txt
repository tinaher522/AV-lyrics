<song artist="Sting" title="Clear_Or_Cloudy">
Clear or cloudy, sweet as April showering
Smooth or frowning so is her face to me
Pleased or smiling like mild May all flowering
When skies blue silk and meadows carpets be
Her speeches notes of that nightbird that singeth
Who though all sweet yet jarring notes outringeth
Her speeches notes of that nightbird that singeth
Who though all sweet yet jarring notes outringeth
Her grace like June, earth and trees be trimmed
In best attire of complete beauty's height
Her love again like summer's days be dimmed
With little clouds of doubtful constant faith
Her trust her doubt, like rain and heat in skies
Gently thundering, she lightning to mine eyes
Her trust her doubt, like rain and heat in skies
Gently thundering, she lightning to mine eyes
Sweet Summer-spring that breatheth life and growing
In weeds as into healing herbs and flowers
Sees of service divers sorts in sowing
Some happily seeming and some being yours
Rain on your herbs and flowers that truly serve
And let your weeds lack dew and duly starve
Rain on your herbs and flowers that truly serve
And let your weeds lack dew and duly starve
