<song artist="Sting" title="Fine_Knacks_For_Ladies">
Fine knacks for ladies, cheap, choice, brave and new
Good pennyworths but money cannot move
I keep a fair but for the fair to view
A beggar may be liberal of love
Though all my wares be trash, the heart is true,
The heart is true, the heart is true
Great gifts are guiles and look for gifts again
My trifles come as treasures from my mind
It is a precious jewel to be plain
Sometimes in shell the Orient's pearls we find
Of others take a sheaf, of me a grain
Of me a grain, of me a grain
Of others take a sheaf, of me a grain
Of me a grain, of me a grain
Within this pack pins, points, laces and gloves
And divers toys fitting a country fair
But in my heart, where duty serves and loves
Turtles and twins, court's brood, a heavenly pair
Happy the heart that thinks of no removes
Of no removes, of no removes
