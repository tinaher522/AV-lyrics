<song artist="Sting" title="Soul_Cake">
A soul, a soul cake
Please, good missus, a soul cake
An apple, a pear, a plum or a cherry
Any good thing to make us all merry
A soul cake, a soul cake
Please, good missus, a soul cake
One for Peter, two for Paul
And three for Him that made us all
God bless the master of this house
And the mistress also
And all the little children
That 'round your table grow
The cattle in your stable
The dogs at your front door
And all that dwell within your gates
We'll wish you ten times more
A soul, a soul cake
Please, good missus, a soul cake
An apple, a pear, a plum or a cherry
Any good thing to make us all merry
A soul cake, a soul cake
Please, good missus, a soul cake
One for Peter, two for Paul
And three for Him that made us all
Go down into the cellar
And see what you can find
If the barrels are not empty
We'll hope that you'll be kind
We'll hope that you'll be kind
With your apple and pear
And we'll come no more a-soulin'
Till Christmas time next year
A soul, a soul cake
Please, good missus, a soul cake
An apple, a pear, a plum or a cherry
Any good thing to make us all merry
A soul cake, a soul cake
Please, good missus, a soul cake
One for Peter, two for Paul
And three for Him that made us all
The streets are very dirty
Me shoes are very thin
I have a little pocket
To put a penny in
If you haven't got a penny
A ha'penny will do
If you haven't got a ha'penny
Then God bless you
A soul, a soul cake
Please, good missus, a soul cake
An apple, a pear, a plum or a cherry
Any good thing to make us all merry
A soul cake, a soul cake
Please, good missus, a soul cake
One for Peter, two for Paul
And three for Him that made us all
