<song artist="Sting" title="Like_A_Beautiful_Smile">
Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May
And summer's lease hath all too short a date
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines
And often is his gold complexion dimmed
And every fair from fair sometime declines
By chance or nature's changing course untrimmed
Like a beautiful smile
That fills up the sky
And I think I know why
Such a beauty won't die
It's eternity's mile
That we walk all this while
But thy eternal summer shall not fade
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st
Nor shall death brag thou wander'st in his shade
When in eternal lines to time thou grow'st
Like a beautiful smile
That fills up the sky
And I think I know why
Such a beauty won't die
It's eternity's mile
That we walk all this while
Like a beautiful dream
That is just what it seems
We're just floating upstream
On eternity's beam
So long as men can breathe or eyes can see
So long lives this and this gives life to thee
Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May
And summmr's lease hath all too short a date
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines
And often is his gold complexion dimmed
And every fair from fair sometime declines
By chance or nature's changing course untrimmed
But thy eternal summer shall not fade
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st
Nor shall death brag thou wander'st in his shade
When in eternal lines to time thou grow'st
So long as men can breathe or eyes can see
So long lives this and this gives life to thee
