<song artist="Sting" title="Down_So_Long">
I been down so long
Being down don't bother me
I been down so long
Being down don't bother me
I'm gonna take all my troubles
Drown 'em in the deep blue sea
I will call her every day
Come stay home at night
No matter how hard I try to please her
She just don't treat me right
I been down so long
Being down don't bother me
I'm gonna take all my troubles
Drown 'em in the deep blue sea
I bought her a fur coat for Christmas
And a diamond ring
She's got the nerve to tell me
Our love don't mean a thing
I been down so long
Being down don't bother me
I'm gonna take all my troubles
Drown 'em in the deep blue sea
Down so long, down so long
I been down so long
I been down so long
I'm gonna take all my troubles
Drown 'em in the deep blue sea
I been down so long
Being down don't bother me
I been down so long
Being down don't bother me
I'm gonna take all my troubles
Drown 'em in the deep blue sea
Down so long, down so long
Down so long, down so long
I'm gonna take all my troubles
Drown 'em in the deep blue
I'm gonna take all my troubles
Drown 'em in the deep blue
I'm gonna take all my troubles
Drown 'em in the deep blue sea
