<song artist="Sting" title="Language_Of_Birds">
They say there's an underground river
That none of us can see
And it flows through winding tunnels
On its way to a tideless sea
And across that sea is an island
A paradise we are told
Where the toils of life are forgotten
And they call it the Island of Souls
For only a soul can go there
A soul that's been set free
From the confines of a working life
To find eternity
Your old man had a cage for his pigeons
But that's really where he kept his soul
And when he watched them fly he would see himself
Least that's how it was told
But his soul was still trapped in the cage, son
While the birds they soared to the sky
He couldn't find his own way out
Least not till the day he died
Oh, a man builds a cage with the tools he is given
His casket is sealed with a riveter's gun
This solitary madness is where he is driven
It was him who was trapped in the soul cage, son
It was him that was trapped in the soul cage
I know that he loved you, but he hadn't the words
He'd be easier speaking the language of birds
For to speak of emotion, it just wasn't done
It was him who was trapped in the soul cage, son
It was him that was trapped in the soul cage
A man builds a cage with the tools he is given
His casket is sealed with a riveter's gun
This solitary madness is where he is driven
It was him who was trapped in the soul cage, son
It was him that was trapped in the soul cage
