<song artist="Sting" title="Little_Wing">
Well, she's walking through the clouds
With a circus mind that's running 'round
Butterflies and zebras and moonbeams and fairy tales
All she ever thinks about is riding with the wind
When I'm sad she comes to me
With a thousand smiles
She gives to me free
It's all right, it's all right, she says
Take anything you want from me
Anything
Well, she's walking through the clouds
With a circus mind that's running 'round
Butterflies and zebras and moonbeams and fairy tales
All she ever thinks about is riding with the wind
When I'm sad she comes to me
With a thousand smiles
She gives to me free
It's all right, it's all right, she says
Take anything, anything, anything
Anything
