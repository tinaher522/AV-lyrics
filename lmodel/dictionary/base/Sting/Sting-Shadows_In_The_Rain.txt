<song artist="Sting" title="Shadows_In_The_Rain">
Woke up in my clothes again this morning
I don't know exactly where I am
I should heed my doctor's warning
He does the best with me he can
He claims I suffer from delusion
I'm so confident I'm sane
It can't be an optical illusion
How can you explain
Shadows in the rain
Shadows in the rain
And if you see us on the corner
We're just dancing in the rain
I tell my friends there when I see them
Outside my windowpane
Shadows in the rain
Shadows in the rain
Shadows in the rain
Shadows in the rain
Shadows in the rain
Shadows in the rain
Woke up in my clothes again this morning
I don't know exactly where I am
I should heed my doctor's warning
He does the best with me he can
He claims I suffer from delusion
I'm so confident I'm sane
It can't be an optical illusion
How can you explain
Shadows in the rain
Shadows in the rain
Shadows in the rain
Shadows in the rain
Shadows
Shadows
Shadows
Shadows in the rain
