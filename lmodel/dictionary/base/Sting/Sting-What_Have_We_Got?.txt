<song artist="Sting" title="What_Have_We_Got?">
Good people, give ear to me story
Pay attention, and none of your lip
For I've brought you five lads and their daddy
Intending to build ye's a ship
Wallsend is wor habitation
It's the place we was all born and bred
And there's nay finer lads in the nation
And none are more gallantly led
What have we got
But the buzzer in the morning
Aye, and what have we got
But the laying of a keel
And what have we got
But the cranes above us soaring
The commotion and the clamor
In the welding of the steel
What have we got
But the mist upon the river
Tell me, what have we got
But the noise inside the hold
Oh, what have we got
But the arse end of the weather
Where we work in horizontal rain
And shiver in the cold
What do ye got? (What do we got?)
What do ye got? (What do we got?)
You've got nowt
We've got nowt else
What do ye got? (What do we got?)
What do ye got? (What do we got?)
You've got nowt
We've got nowt else
What have ye got
But the singing in the cables
Oh, what have ye got
But the ringing in your ears
Aye, what have ye got
But the telling of the fables
And the memories of the ships
That we've been building donkey's years
What do ye got? (What do we got?)
What do ye got? (What do we got?)
You've got nowt
We've got nowt else
What do ye got? (What do we got?)
What do ye got? (What do we got?)
You've got nowt
We've got nowt else
Aye, you've got to die of something
It's written in your fate
Ye may as well die of a Tuesday
And woe betide you're late
What have ye got
All you men what's fit and able
What have ye got
For the straining in your neck
What have ye got
When you're laid out on the table
And the snapping of a cable
When the rigging hits the deck
What have ye got
But the loyalty of brothers
What have ye got
But this union of the dock
What have ye got
A bacon sandwich from your mother
Not a promise of another
With the punching of the clock
What do ye got? (What do we got?)
What do ye got? (What do we got?)
You've got nowt
We've got nowt else
What do ye got? (What do we got?)
Now what do ye got? (What do we got?)
You've got nowt
We've got nowt else
What do ye got? (What do we got?)
What do ye got? (What do we got?)
You've got nowt
We've got nowt else
