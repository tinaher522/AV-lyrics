<song artist="Sting" title="Hadaway">
Ye've gotta be joking, yr tekkin' the piss
I'd have to be stupid to go on wi' this
I wasn't born yesterday or even last week
It's someone with sailing experience ye seek
I wouldn't sail with you's on the last ship aground
In a biblical flood I'd be better off drowned
So drink up yr bevies and have a good sup
I'll no part o' this fancy O'Brian's dreamed up
Find some other idiot to pilot your craft
And tomorrow ye'll be sober
Hadaway, hadaway, hadaway with ye's all
Ye know ye've got nowt, ye've got nothing at all
Hadaway, yr just pissin' yr beer up the wall
And you're out of your tiny minds
I had a friend on the ships, his name was Joe Dorsey
He'd get into port, he'd be straight to the horsies
He begged and he pleaded, he was some operator
600 to one and he'd pay me back later
He claimed it was certain that we'd be in clover
And the next time we sailed past the White Cliffs of Dover
We'd be sailing a yacht of our own to the Med
I lent him the money, I was out of me head
I didn't see hide of him for nine months, maybe ten
And didn't the bastard just ask me again
For the loan of a tenner he'd pay me back soon
All the money he owed me, I answered the loon
Hadaway, hadaway, hadaway with ye's all
Ye know ye've got nowt, ye've got nothing at all
Hadaway, yr just pissin' yr beer up the wall
And you're out of your tiny minds
I once had a girl down in Tenerife
A passionate courtship, albeit brief
But what happened next, it just beggared belief
If I tell ye, ye'll be sober
The second night in she claims she's with child
Afore yesterday night she'd been pure, undefiled
I must be the father, court papers she'd filed
So what did I tell her me rovers
Hadaway, hadaway, hadaway with ye's all
Ye know ye've got nowt, ye've got nothing at all
Hadaway, yr just pissin' yr beer up the wall
Ye think you've got a case, you've got sweet bugger all
And you're out of your tiny minds
And you're out of your tiny minds
And you're out of your tiny minds
