<song artist="Sting" title="Hellhound_On_My_Trail">
Gotta keep moving
Blues falling down like hail
Gotta keep moving
Blues falling down like hail
And these days keep on worrying me
Got a hellhound on my trail
If today was Christmas Eve
And tomorrow was Christmas Day
If today was Christmas Eve
And tomorrow was Christmas Day
All I need is my little sweet rider
To pass the time away
All I need is my little sweet rider
To pass the time away
I can tell the wind is risin'
Leaves tremblin' in the trees
I can tell the wind is risin'
Leaves tremblin' in the trees
All I need is my sweet woman
To keep me company
Gotta keep moving
Blues falling down like hail
Gotta keep moving
Blues falling down like hail
And these days keep on worrying me
There’s a hellhound on my trail
And these days keep on worrying me
There’s a hellhound on my trail
Hellhound
Hellhound on my trail
