<song artist="Sting" title="Low_Life">
The fatal fascination for the seedy part of town
You walk down the street and your head spins 'round and 'round
Don't be seen alone without your friends at night
Take a gun, take a knife to the low life
You don't have to be born into this society
You pay for love but the hate comes free
So bring enough money for the rest of your life
Don't bring your wife to the low life
Rigger yourself to the degredation
Always keep your back to the wall
No rewards for your infatuation
Low life
No life at all
Low life, low life
In here too long to be afraid anymore
You can't reach the bed, so you sleep on the floor
You get so stoned you think you could fly
But you won't get high on the low, low life
Low life
The fatal fascination for the seedy part of town
You walk down the street and your head spins around and 'round
Don't be seen alone without your friends at night
Take a gun, take a knife to the low life
Low life is no life
Low life is no life
