<song artist="Sting" title="Balulalow">
O my dear heart, young Jesu sweet
Prepare Thy cradle in my spreit
And I shall rock Thee in my heart
And never more from Thee depart
But I shall praise Thee evermore
With song as sweet unto Thy glore
The knees of my heart shall I bow
And sing that rich Balulalow
And I shall praise Thee evermore
With song as sweet unto Thy glore
The knees of my heart shall I bow
And sing that rich Balulalow
