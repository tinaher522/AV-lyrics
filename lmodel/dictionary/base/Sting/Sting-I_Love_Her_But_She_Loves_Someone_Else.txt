<song artist="Sting" title="I_Love_Her_But_She_Loves_Someone_Else">
When a man of my age shaves his face in the morning
Who is it that stares back and greets him?
The ghost of his father, long dead all these years
Or the boy that he was, still wet in the ears
Or the terrible sum of all of his fears
In the eyes of this stranger who meets him
So his glance rarely strays from his chin or his jawline
To face up to the truth of his soul
It's the eyes he avoids, so afraid to acknowledge
Something strange, unexpected, out of control
There are times when a man needs to brave his reflection
And face what he sees without fear
It takes a man to accept his mortality
Or be surprised by the presence of a tear
It was only an arrangement
A practical arrangement
I forgot the first commandment
Of the realist's handbook
Don't be fooled by illusions you created yourself
And fall in love with someone
When she loves someone else
Like a covering of snow on a winter's night
It glistens and it sparkles in the moonlight
But it's gone by the morning
How quickly it melts
You still love her
But she loves someone else
And where does that leave you
You self-styled man of vision
You feel stupid, you feel angry
Are you losing your mind
To destroy the one she loves
Does that become your mission
Like a pantomime villain with an axe to grind
To regain your self-respect
Hold your head up like a man
Use the ice around your heart before it melts
But you're not fooling anybody
You're only fooling yourself
Like a covering of snow on a winter's night
It glistens and it sparkles in the moonlight
But it's gone by the morning
How quickly it melts
You still love her
But she loves someone else
