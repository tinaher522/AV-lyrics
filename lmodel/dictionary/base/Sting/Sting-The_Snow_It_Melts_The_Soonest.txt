<song artist="Sting" title="The_Snow_It_Melts_The_Soonest">
Oh, the snow it melts the soonest when the winds begin to sing
And the corn it ripens fastest when the frosts are setting in
And when a woman tells me my face she'll soon forget
Before we part I want to croon, she's fain to follow yet
Oh, the snow it melts the soonest when the wind begins to sing
And the swallow skims without a thought as long as it is spring
But when spring goes and winter blows, my lassie, you'll be fain
For all your pride to follow me across the stormy main
Oh, the snow it melts the soonest when the winds begin to sing
And the bee that flew when summer shone in winter cannot sting
I've seen a woman's anger melt betwixt the night and morn
It's surely not a harder thing to tame a woman's scorn
Oh, never say me farewell here, no farewell I'll receive
And you shall take me to the stile and kiss and take your leave
I'll stay until the curlew calls and the martlet takes his wing
Oh, the snow it melts the soonest when the winds begin to sing
