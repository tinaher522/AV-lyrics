<song artist="Sting" title="The_Lowest_Trees_Have_Tops">
The lowest trees have tops, the ant her gall
The fly her spleen, the little spark his heat
And slender hairs cast shadows though but small
And bees have stings although they be not great
Seas have their source, and so have shallow springs
And love is love in beggars and in kings
Seas have their source, and so have shallow springs
And love is love in beggars and in kings
Where waters smoothest run deep are the fords
The dial stirs, yet none perceives it move
The firmest faith is in the fewest words
The turtles cannot sing and yet they love
True hearts have eyes, and ears no tongues to speak
They hear and see and sigh and then they break
True hearts have eyes, and ears no tongues to speak
They hear and see and sigh and then they break
