<song artist="Sting" title="There_Is_No_Rose_Of_Such_Virtue">
There is no rose of such virtue
As is the rose that bare Jesu
There is no rose of such virtue
As is the rose that bare Jesu
For in this rose contained it was
Heaven and earth in little space
Alleluia
There is no rose of such virtue
As is the rose that bare Jesu
By that rose we may well see
That He is God in persons three
Alleluia
There is no rose of such virtue
As is the rose that bare Jesu
The angels sung and the shepherds, too
Gloria in excelsis Deo
Alleluia
There is no rose of such virtue
As is the rose that bare Jesu
