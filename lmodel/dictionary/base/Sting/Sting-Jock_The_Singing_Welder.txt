<song artist="Sting" title="Jock_The_Singing_Welder">
Any shipyard man can sing when he works upon the hull
Amongst the noise and the clamour that he all but disregards
So he'll sing to himself and no one pays him any mind
He's just another crazy welder in the shipyards
But inside this welder's helmet, if you'll let me demonstrate
When the mask is in position and the fumes accumulate
There's the finest echo chamber with a sound that can't be beat
Where I'm the king of rock and roll and the world is at me feet
And it may not sound like much to all them jokers on the squad
But inside of here I'm singing with the voice of fuckin' God
I'm Jock the singing welder
Heavy metal, rock and roll
Jazz, blues, roots, reggae
Country, rockabilly, soul
When I'm singing, well you'd best lock up
Your daughters and your mothers
I'm Gene Vincent, Eddie Cochrane
I'm the missing Everly Brother
I'm Jock the singing welder
I'm heading for the heights
I'm Jock the singing welder
And the 'cetylene lights
I'm more than just a welder
And I'm telling you my name
One day you'll see it blazoned
In the rockin' Hall of Fame
I've got these songs in my head
I've got this dancing in me bones
I'm Roy Orbison, Elvis Presley
I'm Tom Fuckin' Jones
I'm Jock the singing welder
I'm heading for the heights
I'm Jock the singing welder
And the 'cetylene lights
Prometheus he stole the fire and he brought it down to Earth
It was a prehistoric welder who figured out what it was worth
They called it holy metallurgy and I want it to be clear
That no man puts asunder what I've joined together here
I'm Jock the singing welder
In the belly of the ship
I've got my shaky leg
I got my quivering lip
I'm Jock the singing welder
And I haven't got a choice
'Cause I'm singing all day at the top of my voice
I'm Jock the singing welder
And the 'cetylene lights
There's an empty throne waiting every Saturday night
There'll be no more mistaking where I've set my sights
I ain't no pretender 'cause it's mine by rights
I'm Jock the singing welder and the 'cetylene lights
Jock the singing welder and the 'cetylene lights
Jock the singing welder and the 'cetylene lights
Jock the singing welder and the oxy-acetylene lights
