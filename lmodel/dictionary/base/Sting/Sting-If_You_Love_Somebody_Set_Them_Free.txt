<song artist="Sting" title="If_You_Love_Somebody_Set_Them_Free">
Free, free, set them free
Free, free, set them free
Free, free, set them free
Free, free, set them free
If you need somebody
Call my name
If you want someone
You can do the same
If you want to keep something precious
Gotta lock it up and throw away the key
If you want to hold onto your possession
Don't even think about me
If you love somebody
If you love someone
If you love somebody
If you love someone
Set them free
Set them free
Set them free
Set them free
If it's a mirror you want
Just look into my eyes
Or a whipping boy
Someone to despise
Or a prisoner in the dark
Tied up in chains you just can't see
Or a beast in a gilded cage
That's all some people ever want to be
If you love somebody
If you love someone
If you love somebody
If you love someone
Set them free
Set them free
Set them free
Set them free
You can't control an independent heart 
Can't tear the one you love apart
Forever conditioned to believe that we can't live
We can't live here and be happy with less
So many riches, so many souls
With everything we see that we want to possess
If you need somebody
Call my name
If you want someone
You can do, you can do, you can do the same
If you want to keep something precious
Gotta lock it up and throw away the key
Want to hold on to your possession
Don't even think about me
If you love somebody
If you love someone
If you love somebody
If you love someone
Set them free
Set them free
Set them free
Set them free...
