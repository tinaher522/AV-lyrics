<song artist="Sting" title="Bethlehem_Down">
"When He is King we will give Him a King's gifts
Myrrh for His sweetness and gold for a crown
Beautiful robes", said the young girl to Joseph
Fair with her firstborn on Bethlehem Down
Bethlehem Down is full of the starlight
Winds for the spices, and stars for the gold
Mary for sleep, and for lullaby music
Songs of a shepherd by Bethlehem fold
When He is King they will clothe Him in grave-sheets
Myrrh for embalming, and wood for a crown
He that lies now in the white arms of Mary
Sleeping so lightly on Bethlehem Down
Here He has peace and a short while for dreaming
Close huddled oxen to keep Him from cold
Mary for love, and for lullaby music
Songs of a shepherd by Bethlehem Down
