Dear Heather
Please walk by me again
With a drink in your hand
And your legs all white
From the winter
Your legs all white
From the winter
And your legs all white
From the winter
 
Dear Heather
Please walk by me again
With a drink in your hand
And your legs all white
From the winter
Your legs all white
From the winter
And your legs all white
From the winter
Dear Heather
Please walk by me again
With a drink in your hand
And your legs all white
From the winter
Your legs all white
From the  winter
And your  legs all  white
From the winter
 
Dear Heather
Please walk by me again
With a drink in your hand
And your legs all white
From the winter
Your legs all white
From the  winter
And your  legs all  white
From the winter
