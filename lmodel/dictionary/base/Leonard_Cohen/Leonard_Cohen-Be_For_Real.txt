<song artist="Leonard_Cohen" title="Be_For_Real">
Are you back in my life to stay
Or is it just for today
That you need me?
If it's a thrill you're looking for
Well, Honey, I'm flexible. Oh, yeah.
Just be for real oh, Baby
Be for real oh, Baby
You see I don't want to be hurt by love again.
Now you see I'm not naive.
But I would like to believe
What you tell me.
So don't give me the world today
And tomorrow take it away, oh no.
Just be for real oh, Baby...
Thanks for the song Mr. Knight.
