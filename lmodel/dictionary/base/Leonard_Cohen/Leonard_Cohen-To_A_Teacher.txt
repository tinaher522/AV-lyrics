<song artist="Leonard_Cohen" title="To_A_Teacher">
Hurt once and for all into silence.
A long pain ending without a song to prove it.
Who could stand beside you so close to Eden,
When you glinted in every eye the held-high razor,
Shivering every ram and son?
And now the silent loony bin
Where the shadows live in the rafters like day-weary bats,
Until the turning mind, a radar signal, lures them to exaggerate
Mountain-size on the white stone wall your tiny limp.
How can I leave you in such a house?
Are there no more saints and wizards
To praise their ways with pupils,
No more evil to stun with the slap
Of a wet red tongue?
Did you confuse the Messiah in a mirror
And rest because he had finally come?
Let me cry: "Help!" beside you, teacher.
I have entered under this dark roof
As fearlessly as an honoured son
Enters his father's house.
