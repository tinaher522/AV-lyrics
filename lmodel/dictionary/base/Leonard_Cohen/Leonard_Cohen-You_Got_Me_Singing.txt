<song artist="Leonard_Cohen" title="You_Got_Me_Singing">
You got me singing
Even though the news is bad
You got me singing
The only song I ever had
You got me singing
Ever since the river died
You got me thinking
Of the places we could hide
You got me singing
Even though the world is gone
You got me thinking
That I’d like to carry on
You got me singing
Even though it all looks grim
You got me singing
The Hallelujah hymn
You got me singing
Like a prisoner in a jail
You got me singing
Like my pardon’s in the mail
You got me wishing
Our little love would last
You got me thinking
Like those people of the past
You got me singing
Even though the world is gone
You got me thinking
That I’d like to carry on
You got me singing
Even though it all went wrong
You got me singing
The Hallelujah song
Singing the Hallelujah song
