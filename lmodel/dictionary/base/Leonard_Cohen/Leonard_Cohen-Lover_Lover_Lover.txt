<song artist="Leonard_Cohen" title="Lover_Lover_Lover">
I asked my father
I said: "Father change my name"
The one I'm using now it's covered up
With fear and filth and cowardice and shame
Yes and lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, come back to me
Yes and lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, come back to me
He said: "I locked you in this body
I meant it as a kind of trial
You can use it for a weapon
Or to make some woman smile"
Yes and lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, come back to me
Yes and lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, come back to me
"Then let me start again," I cried
"Please let me start again
I want a face that's fair this time
I want a spirit that is calm"
Yes and lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, come back to me
Yes and lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, come back to me
"I never turned aside," he said
"I never walked away
It was you who built the temple
It was you who covered up my face"
Yes and lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, come back to me
Yes and lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, come back to me
And may the spirit of this song
May it rise up pure and free
May it be a shield for you
A shield against the enemy
Yes and lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, come back to me
Yes and lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, come back to me
Yes and lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, come back to me
Yes and lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, come back to me
