<song artist="Leonard_Cohen" title="Because_Of">
Because of a few songs
Wherein I spoke of their mystery
Women have been
Exceptionally kind
To my old age
They make a secret place
In their busy lives
And they take me there
They become naked
In their different ways
And they say:
"Look at me, Leonard!
Look at me one last time!"
Then they bend over the bed
And cover me up
Like a baby that is shivering
