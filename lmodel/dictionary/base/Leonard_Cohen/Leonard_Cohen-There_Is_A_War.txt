<song artist="Leonard_Cohen" title="There_Is_A_War">
There is a war between the rich and poor
A war between the man and the woman
There is a war between the ones who say there is a war
And the ones who say there isn't
Why don't you come on back to the war
Why don't you come on back to the war
Ah yes I live here with a woman and a child
The situation makes me kind of nervous
Yes, I rise up from her arms, she says: "I guess you call this love"
I call it service
Why don't you come on back to the war
Why don't you come on back to the war
You cannot stand what I've become
You much prefer that gentleman I was before
I was so easy to defeat, I was so easy to control
I didn't even know there was a war
Why don't you come on back to the war
Why don't you come on back to the war
Come on back to the war
Come on back to the war
There is a war between the rich and poor
A war between the man and the woman
There is a war between the left and right
A war between the black and white
A war between the odd and the even
Why don't you come on back to this war
Why don't you come on back to the war
Why don't you come on back to the war
Come on back to the war
Come on back to the war
Come on back to the war
Come on back to the war
