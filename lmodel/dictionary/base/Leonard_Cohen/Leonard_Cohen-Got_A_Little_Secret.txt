<song artist="Leonard_Cohen" title="Got_A_Little_Secret">
I've got a little secret
If you promise not to tell
I've got a little secret
If you promise not to tell
I made a date in Heaven,
Oh Lord but I've been keepin' it in Hell
I'd like to love you baby
It just don't feel right
I'd like to love you baby
It just don't feel right
I've got this full length mirror
And it ain't a pretty sight
I'd like to hold you baby
But my arms are old and weak
I'd like to hold you baby
But my arms are old and weak
I was listenin' to your story
But I guess I fell asleep
I've got a little secret
If you promise not to tell
I say I've got a little secret
If you promise not to tell
I made a date in Heaven
But I've been keepin' it in Hell
It's kinda chilly in your kitchen
It must be ten below
It's kinda chilly in your kitchen
Must be ten below
I bought a ticket to Jamaica
I guess I lost it in the snow
I've got a little secret
If you promise not to tell
I say I've got a little secret
If you promise not to tell
I made a date in Heaven, Oh Lord
But I've been keepin' it in Hell
I made a date in Heaven, Oh Lord
But I've been keepin' it in Hell
