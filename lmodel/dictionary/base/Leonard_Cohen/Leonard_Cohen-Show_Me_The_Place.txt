<song artist="Leonard_Cohen" title="Show_Me_The_Place">
Show me the place
Where you want your slave to go
Show me the place
I've forgotten, I don't know
Show me the place
For my head is bending low
Show me the place
Where you want your slave to go
Show me the place
Help me roll away the stone
Show me the place
I can't move this thing alone
Show me the place
Where the Word became a man
Show me the place
Where the suffering began
The troubles came
I saved what I could save
A thread of light
A particle, a wave
But there were chains
So I hastened to behave
There were chains
So I loved you like a slave
Show me the place
Where you want your slave to go
Show me the place
I've forgotten, I don't know
Show me the place
For my head is bending low
Show me the place
Where you want your slave to go
The troubles came
I saved what I could save
A thread of light
A particle, a wave
But there were chains
So I hastened to behave
There were chains
So I loved you like a slave
Show me the place
Help me roll away the stone
Show me the place
I can't move this thing alone
Show me the place
Where the Word became a man
Show me the place
Where the suffering began
