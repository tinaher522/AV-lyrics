<song artist="Leonard_Cohen" title="Never_Gave_Nobody_Trouble">
Couldn't pay the mortgage
And it broke my baby's heart
I couldn't pay the mortgage
It broke my baby's heart
I never gave nobody trouble
But it ain't too late to start!
Don't wanna break no window
Don't wanna burn no car
Don't wanna break no window
And I don't wanna burn your car
You've got a right to all your riches
But you let it go too far
You sail the mighty ocean
On a yacht designed for you
You sail the mighty ocean
On a yacht designed for you
Yeah, but the oceans fig with garbage
You ain't good on make it through
I never gave nobody trouble
I'm a (locked and border) man
I never gave nobody trouble
I'm a l) og and order) man
I said I never gave nobody trouble
But you know god damn well that I can!
