<song artist="Leonard_Cohen" title="Stages">
(spoken...)
Well all my friends are gone and my hair is grey
I ache in the places where I used to play
And I'm crazy for love but I'm not coming on
I'm just paying my rent every day
In the tower of song
I'm just paying my rent every day
In the tower of song
I said to Hank Williams: how lonely does it get?
Hank Williams he hasn't answered me yet
Oh but I hear him coughing all all night long
A hundred floors above me
In the tower of song
