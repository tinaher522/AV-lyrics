<song artist="Leonard_Cohen" title="Born_In_Chains">
I was born in chains
But I was taken out of Egypt
I was bound to a burden
But the burden, it was raised
Lord, I can no longer
Keep this secret
Blessed is the Name
The Name be praised
I fled to the edge
Of the Mighty Sea of Sorrow
Pursued by the riders
Of a cruel and dark regime
But the waters parted
And my soul crossed over
Out of Egypt
Out of Pharaoh’s dream
Word of Words
And Measure of all Measures
Blessed is the Name
The Name be blessed
Written on my heart
In burning Letters
That’s all I know
I cannot read the rest
I was idle with my soul
When I heard that you could use me
I followed very closely
But my life remained the same
But then you showed me
Where you had been wounded
In every atom
Broken is the Name
I was alone on the road
And your Love was so confusing
All my teachers told me
I had myself to blame
But in the Grip
Of Sensual Illusion
A sweet unknowing
Unified the Name
Word of Words
And Measure of all Measures
Blessed is the Name
The Name be blessed
Written on my heart
In burning Letters
That’s all I know
I cannot read the rest
I’ve heard the soul unfolds
In the chambers of its longing
And the bitter liquor sweetens
In the hammered cup
But all the Ladders
Of the Night have fallen
Only darkness now
To lift the Longing up
Word of Words
And Measure of all Measures
Blessed is the Name
The Name be blessed
Written on my heart
In burning Letters
That’s all I know
I cannot read the rest
