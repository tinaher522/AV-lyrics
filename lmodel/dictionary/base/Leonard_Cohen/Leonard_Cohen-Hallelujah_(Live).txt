<song artist="Leonard_Cohen" title="Hallelujah_(Live)">
Baby I've been here before
I know this room, I walked this floor
I used to live alone here before I knew ya
Yeah and I've seen your flag on the marble arch
But listen love; love is not some kind of victory march
No it's a cold and it's a very broken Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
There was a time you let me know
What's really going on below
Ah but now you never show it to me, do ya?
Well but I remember, yeah, when I moved in you
And the holy dove; she was moving too
Yes and every single breath that we drew was Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Maybe there's a God above
As for me; all I ever seem to learn from love
Is how to shoot at someone who out-drew ya
Yeah, but it's not a complaint that you hear tonight
It's not the laughter of someone who claims to have seen the light
No, it's a cold and it's a very lonely Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
I did my best, it wasn't much
I couldn't feel, so I learned to touch
I've told the truth; I didn't come all this way to fool ya
Yeah and even though it all went wrong
I'll stand right here before the lord of song
With nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
