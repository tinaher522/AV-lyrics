<song artist="Leonard_Cohen" title="Slow">
I’m slowing down the tune
I never liked it fast
You want to get there soon
I want to get there last
It’s not because I’m old
It’s not the life I led
I always liked it slow
That’s what my momma said
I’m lacing up my shoe
But I don’t want to run
I’ll get here when I do
Don’t need no starting gun
It’s not because I’m old
And it’s not what dying does
I always liked it slow
Slow is in my blood
I always liked it slow
I never liked it fast
With you it’s got to go
With me it’s got to last
It’s not because I’m old
It’s not because I’m dead
I always liked it slow
That’s what my momma said
All your moves are swift
All your turns are tight
Let me catch my breath
I thought we had all night
I like to take my time
I like to linger as it flies
A weekend on your lips
A lifetime in your eyes
I always liked it slow
I never liked it fast
With you it’s got to go
With me it’s got to last
It’s not because I’m old
It’s not the life I led
I always liked it slow
That’s what my momma said
I’m slowing down the tune
I never liked it fast
You want to get there soon
I want to get there last
So, baby, let me go
You’re wanted back in town
In case they want to know
I’m just trying to slow it down
