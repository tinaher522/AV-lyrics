<song artist="Leonard_Cohen" title="Minute_Prologue">
I've been listening
To all the dissension.
I've been listening
To all the pain.
And I feel that no matter
What I do for you,
It's going to come back again.
But I think that I can heal it,
But I think that I can heal it,
I'm a fool, but I think I can heal it
With this song.
