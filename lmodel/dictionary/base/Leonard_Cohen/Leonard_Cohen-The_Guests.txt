<song artist="Leonard_Cohen" title="The_Guests">
One by one the guests arrive
The guests are coming through
The open-hearted many
The broken-hearted few
And no one knows where the night is going
And no one knows where the wine is flowing
Oh love, I need you, I need you, I need you, I need you
I need you now
And those who dance, begin to dance
Those who weap, begin
And welcome, welcome cries of voice
Let all my guests come in
And no one knows where the night is going
And no one knows where the wine is flowing
Oh love, I need you, I need you, I need you, I need you
I need you now
And all goes stumbling through that house
In lonely secrecy
Saying do reveal yourself
or why has thou forsaken me
And no one knows where the night is going
And no one knows where the wine is flowing
Oh love, I need you, I need you, I need you, I need you
I need you now
All at once the tortures flare
The inner door flies open
One by one they enter there
in every style of passion
And no one knows where the night is going
And no one knows where the wine is flowing
Oh love, I need you, I need you, I need you, I need you
I need you now
And here they take their sweet repast
Wild house and grounds resolve
And one by one the guests are cast beyond the garden wall
And no one knows where the night is going
And no one knows where the wine is flowing
Oh love, I need you, I need you, I need you, I need you
I need you now
For those who dance, begin to dance
Those who weap, begin
Those who earnestly are lost
are lost, and lost begin
And no one knows where the night is going
And no one knows where the wine is flowing
Oh love, I need you, I need you, I need you, I need you
I need you now
One by one the guests arrive
The guests are coming through
The broken-hearted many
The open-hearted few
And no one knows where the night is going
And no one knows where the wine is flowing
Oh love, I need you, I need you, I need you, I need you
I need you now
