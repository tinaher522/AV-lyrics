<song artist="Leonard_Cohen" title="Different_Sides">
We find ourselves on different sides
Of a line that nobody drew
Though it all may be one in the higher eye
Down here where we live, it is two
I, to my side call the meek and the mild
You, to your side call the Word
By virtue of suffering I claim to have won
You claim to have never been heard
Both of us say there are laws to obey
Yeah, but frankly I don't like your tone
You want to change the way I make love
(I want to leave it) I want to leave it alone
The pull of the moon, the thrust of the sun
And thus, the ocean is crossed
The waters are blessed while a shadowy guest
Kindles a light for the lost
Both of us say there are laws to obey
Yeah, but frankly I don't like your tone
You want to change the way I make love
(I want to leave it) I want to leave it alone
Down in the valley the famine goes on
Famine up on the hill
I say that you shouldn't, you couldn't, you can't
You say that you must and you will
Both of us say there are laws to obey
Yeah, but frankly I don't like your tone
You want to change the way I make love
(I want to leave it) I want to leave it alone
You want to live where the suffering is
I want to get out of town
C'mon baby, give me a kiss
Stop writing everything down
Both of us say there are laws to obey
Yeah, but frankly I don't like your tone
You want to change the way I make love
I want to leave it alone
Both of us say there are laws to obey
