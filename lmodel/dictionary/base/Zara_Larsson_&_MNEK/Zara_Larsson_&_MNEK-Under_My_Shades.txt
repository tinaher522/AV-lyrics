<song artist="Zara_Larsson_&_MNEK" title="Under_My_Shades">
I had a hard time making out the lyrics for this one, but here's what I got:
This young girl, she's so fresh
she's just chilling 
Day and night, right or left
haters grilling
But this young girl, she don't care
no big deal, yeah 
I'm on one
can't be (stopped?)
(Straight-up grilling?)
Can't nobody tell what I'm watching
what I'm watching
Can't nobody see who I'm clocking
who I'm clocking
I can see the world before my eyes
I'll take the world and make it (nice?)
Just put a cherry on top 
Leave them on, yeah
They never come off
I can see the world before my eyes
??????????
Just so incredibly (soft?)
I leave them on, yeah
they never come off
These young guys
act so fly
They keep (jacking?)
I just look, I don't buy
window shopping
These young boys
make a lot of noise
But that won't phase me
I'll be stunning with my shades
and it makes 'em crazy
????????
????????
????????
????????
I can see the world before my eyes
I'll take the world and make it (nice?)
Just put a cherry on top 
Leave them on, yeah
They never come off
I can see the world before my eyes
??????????
Just so incredibly (soft?)
I leave them on, yeah
they never come off
Never come off
(I put my shades on the streets)
Never come off
(I put my shades at the beach)
Never come off
(I put my shades at the club)
Never come off 
never, ever come off
Never come off
(I put my shades at the mall)
Never come off
(I put my shades in the hall)
Never come off
(I put my shades when I want)
Never come off
never, ever come off
(Oh, hey, yeah, yeah)
Get your shades
put 'em on
Get your Gucci's, or Vuitton's
Get your Ray's, or your fakes
Come on, come on, come on (come on, come on)
put 'em on!
I can see the world before my eyes
I'll take the world and make it (nice?)
Just put a cherry on top 
Leave them on, yeah
They never come off
I can see the world before my eyes
??????????
Just so incredibly (soft?)
I leave them on, yeah
they never come off
Never come off
(I put my shades on the streets)
Never come off
(I put my shades at the beach)
Never come off
(I put my shades at the club)
Never come off 
never, ever come off
Never come off
(I put my shades at the mall)
Never come off
(I put my shades in the hall)
Never come off
(I put my shades when I want)
Never come off
never, ever come off
