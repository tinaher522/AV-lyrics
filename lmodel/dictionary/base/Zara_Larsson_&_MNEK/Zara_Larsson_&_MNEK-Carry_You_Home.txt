<song artist="Zara_Larsson_&_MNEK" title="Carry_You_Home">
I've been knocked down,
I've been lost
With the ground shaking under my feet
I gave it all to someone
Who'd said fire run
I've been I've been through the days
When bright love turns into hate
You've been you've been through your break
With the light all gone.
When the one you care for just takes it all,
Washing you down like a waterfall
You lose the way and you hit the wall
I'd be the one
I'd be the one
I'd be the one
To carry you home
When it hurts like you've crushed from above
With your broken bones
You can't move your arms to lift up
You're right you're right you're right
Sometimes you need someone to carry you home
But it hurts like you've crushed from above
When it's true love!
I've been knocked down on my own,
With the waters too deep, and too cold
Sleepless so many nights
With the broken heart running wild
When the one you care for just takes it all,
Washing you down like a waterfall
You lose the way and you hit the wall
I'd be the one
I'd be the one
I'd be the one
To carry you home
And it hurts like you've crushed from above
With your broken bones
You can't move your arms to lift up
You're right you're right you're right
Sometimes you need someone to carry you home
But it hurts like you've crushed from above
When it's true love!
I gave it all to someone
Who said fire run
