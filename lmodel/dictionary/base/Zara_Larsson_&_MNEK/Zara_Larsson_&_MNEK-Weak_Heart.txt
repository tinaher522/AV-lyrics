<song artist="Zara_Larsson_&_MNEK" title="Weak_Heart">
Early morning 
Someone's calling 
Who could this be? 
Reach my phone 
And your name showing 
On my caller-id 
I decline and 
Сhange my mind and 
Сall you back up 
You say hey 
I say hey there 
We don't say much 
It's almost like singing that sad song 
You make it so easy to hang on 
Cause I've a weak heart, baby, 
I've a weak heart 
Yeah I-I-I-I have such a weak heart 
I've a weak heart 
Yeah I-I-I-I have when it comes to you 
I put my money on a long shot 
(I gotta, I gotta, I gotta) 
When it comes to you 
It's like I want it but I can't stop 
(I gotta, I gotta, I gotta) 
Yeah I've a weak heart, baby, I've a weak heart 
You come over 
I say slow now 
This can't go on 
Grab a chair please 
Sit right there, it's 
Time we had to talk 
Boy, talk leads to touches 
And then it's on to the next 
Body to body until I'm catching my breath 
This is not what I'm supposed to do 
Try to shake it off, but I'm stuck on you 
So I'm gonna keep singing this sad song 
It never felt better to be wrong 
Cause I've a weak heart, baby, 
I've a weak heart 
Yeah I-I-I-I have such a weak heart 
I've a weak heart 
Yeah I-I-I-I have when it comes to you 
I put my money on a long shot 
(I gotta, I gotta, I gotta) 
When it comes to you 
It's like I want it but I can't stop 
(I gotta, I gotta, I gotta) 
Yeah I've a weak heart, baby, 
I've a weak heart
