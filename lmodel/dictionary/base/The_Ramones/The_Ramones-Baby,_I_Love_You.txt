<song artist="The_Ramones" title="Baby,_I_Love_You">
Have I ever told you 
How good it feels to hold you 
It isn't easy to explain 
And though I'm really trying 
I think I may start crying 
My heart can't wait another day 
When you kiss me I just gotta 
Kiss me I just gotta 
Kiss me I just gotta say 
Baby I love you C'mon baby 
Baby I love you Ooh-wee-ooh baby 
Baby I love I love only you 
I can't live without you 
I love everything about you 
I can't help it if I feel this way 
Oh, I'm so glad I found you 
I want my arms around you 
I love to hear you call my name 
Oh, tell me that ya feel 
Tell me that ya feel 
Tell me that ya feel the same 
Baby I love you C'mon baby 
Baby I love you Ooh-wee-ooh baby 
Baby I love I love only you 
Oh, I'm so glad I found you 
I want my arms around you 
I love to hear you call my name 
Oh, tell me that ya feel 
Tell me that ya feel 
Tell me that ya feel the same
