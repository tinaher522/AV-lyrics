<song artist="The_Ramones" title="Sitting_In_My_Room">
Sitting in my room record player on
Sitting in my room humming a sickening tune
Sitting in my room something to do soon
We know what we think of them the problems just
Keep piling in they got complaints about everything
Its us against them its us against them
Its us against them
They just wanna worry thats not what any kid
Should have to do they just wanna be so lame
Maybe they should try and sniff some glue
