<song artist="The_Ramones" title="Anxiety">
Anxiety, anxiety, keeps me happy.
Anxiety, anxiety, keeps me happy.
Always stiff, all day long.
Nothing's right till it's all wrong.
It makes no sense until I'm tense.
Always laughing at your expense.
Anxiety, anxiety, keeps me happy.
Anxiety, anxiety, keeps me happy.
Always biting on my nails.
Always stiff, it never fails.
Now I think I'll pick my nose,
wipe it on my sweaty clothes.
Anxiety, anxiety, keeps me happy.
Anxiety, anxiety, keeps me happy.
Always screamin' at someone.
Got a temper like a gun.
Hair trigger personality.
Anxiety, anxiety, keeps me hap-happy.
(bridge)
And I'm crazy, zrazy, crazy in a crazy world.
I'm crazy, zrazy, crazy in a crazy world.
I'm crazy, zrazy, crazy in a crazy world.
I'm crazy, zrazy, crazy in a crazy world.
A-N-X-I-E-T-Y
A-N-X-I-E-T-Y
Anxiety keeps me high, cross my heart and hope to die. ANXIETY
ANXIETY
ANXIETY
ANXIETY
