<song artist="The_Ramones" title="7-11">
I met her at the 7-11 now Im in the 7th
Heaveb tell me, tell me can this be true
I never thought Id ever meet a girl like you
She was standing by the space invaders so I said
Can I see you later yeah we went for a little
Spin down to teh holiday inn
We was young and in love we was young and in love
And youre the only girl Im ever thinking of
We went down to the record swap the kids were
Dancing to the blitzkrieg bop bop-shoo-wop
Shoo-wop shoo-wop bop-shoo-wop shoo-wop shoo-wop
What ever happened to the radio and where did all
The fun sons go summer fun, with the beach boys on
But we all know what went wrong oh-wo-wo
We was young and in love we was young and in love
And youre the only girl Im ever dreaming of
And so we went down to the dance which turned
Into a whole romance and after just one night
I never knew things could be so right
Oh-no-no-no-no-no-no-no
I kissed and hugged her and I said good-bye
Last thing I knew she wouldnt make it alive
Oncoming car went out of control it crushed
My baby and it crushed my soul now all ive
Got is sorrow and pain standing out here
In the rain the crash, shattering glass,
The sirens and pain is driving me insade oh-yeah
We was young and in love we was young and in love
And youre the only girl Im ever thinking of
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
