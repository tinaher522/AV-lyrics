<song artist="The_Ramones" title="Commando">
They do their best
They do what they can
They get them ready for Vietnam
From old Hanoi to East Berlin
Commando - involved again
They do their best
They do what they can
They get them ready for Vietnam
First rule is: The laws of Germany
Second rule is: Be nice to mommy
Third rule is: Don't talk to Commies
Fourth rule is: Eat kosher salamis
