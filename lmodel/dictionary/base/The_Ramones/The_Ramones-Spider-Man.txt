1, 2, 3, 4...
Spider-Man, Spider-Man
Does whatever a spider can
Spins a web, any size
Catches thieves just like flies
Look out!
Here comes the Spider-Man
Is he strong? Listen, bud
He's got radioactive blood
Can he swing from a thread?
Take a look overhead
Hey there!
There goes the Spider-Man
In the chill of the night, at the scene of a crime
Like a streak of light, he arrives just in time
Spider-Man, Spider-Man
Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man
Wealth and fame? He's ignored
Action is his reward
Look out! Here comes the Spider-Man
Look out!
Let's go!
In the chill of the night, at the scene of a crime
Like a streak of light, he arrives just in time
Spider-Man, Spider-Man
Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man
Wealth and fame? He's ignored
Action is his reward
To him, life's just a great big bang up
Wherever there's a hang-up
You'll find the Spider-Man!
