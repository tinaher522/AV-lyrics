<song artist="The_Ramones" title="Here_Today,_Gone_Tomorrow">
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
I love you
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
I love you
I do, I do
But I told her why we just can't make it
I want you still but just can't take it
The time has come we oughta break it
Someone has to pay the price
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
It's over
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
It's true, it's true
And I think of times we were together
As time went on it seemed forever
But times have changed
Now things are better
Someone had to pay the price
