<song artist="The_Ramones" title="I_Don't_Wanna_Live_This_Life">
Now that you're gone, I feel the pain
My heart trembles, I call your name
I miss your touch, your soft blonde hair
I keep searching for an answer, it just ain't there
And I don't want to live this life
And I don't want to live this life
And I don't want to live this life anymore
Everywhere I turn, the finger points on me
You'll never understand I'm in misery
'Cause, baby, without you, I have no one
Oh, my sweet darling, what have I done
And I don't want to live this life
And I don't want to live this life
And I don't want to live this life anymore
She smiled at me as I held her carefully
Her last words were "I love you" thought it set me free
And I can't forget that look on her face
It looked like an angel as she died in my prayers
And I don't want to live this life
And I don't want to live this life
And I don't want to live this life anymore
