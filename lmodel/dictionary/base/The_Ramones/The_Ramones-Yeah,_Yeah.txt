<song artist="The_Ramones" title="Yeah,_Yeah">
Yea, yea there's a girl I know Yea, yea well I love her so
Well she's a little of this a little of that
She makes my heart go flippity flap Oh baby baby I just love her so
Yea, yea well she's the most The coolest chick on the whole East Coast
She makes my heart spin like a tilt-a-whirl
Yea, yea, yea she's my kind of girl Whoa baby I just love her so
We could go to a drive-in It doesn't matter ya know
She's the kind of girl that I love so
Yea, yea when she holds me close Yea, yea well she's the most
Well she's a little of this a little of that
She makes my heart go flippity flap Oh baby baby I just love her so
We could go down to E street It doesn't matter ya know
She's the kind of girl that I love so
Yea, yea there's a girl I know
Yea, yea well I love her so
Well she's a little of this a little of that
She makes my heart go flippity flap Oh baby baby I just love her so
