<song artist="The_Ramones" title="Touring">
Well, we've been to London and we've been to L.A.
Spain, New Zealand, and the U.S.A.
Europe, Japan, and Pango-Pango
Canada, Siam, Oz and Kamoto
The kids all come from miles around
The party gets started when the sun goes down
A Holiday Inn's the only home I know, I know, I know, I know
Rock-n-rolls alive 'cause we got the power baby
Cursing down the highway at 500 miles an hour baby
We got a fuel-injected tour bus, man it really flies
With a video tape deck inside
Let's go, rock-n-roll, everybody come on
Let's go, rock-n-roll, everybody come on now
Touring, touring, is never boring
Touring, touring, is never boring
Touring, touring, is never boring
Touring, touring, oh baby, touring
Especially with your favorite girl
Touring, touring, all around the world
Well we've been around this great big world
And we've met all kinds of guys and girls
From Kamoto Islands to Rockaway Beach
No, it's not hard, not far to reach
American girls knock me out, ya know
Fast cars, cold beer, and rock-n-roll
America is the only home I know, I know, I know, I know
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go 500 miles to Mexico
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go 200 miles to Tokyo
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go
Drive, drive, drive the night away
Straight on through to the break of day
Drive, drive, drive the night away
Well, it's in your blood, it's in your blood
Touring, touring, is never boring
Touring, touring, is never boring
Touring, touring, is never boring
Touring, touring, oh baby, touring
Especially with your favorite girl now
Touring touring, all around now
Touring touring, all around the world
Touring touring, all around now
Touring touring, all around the world
