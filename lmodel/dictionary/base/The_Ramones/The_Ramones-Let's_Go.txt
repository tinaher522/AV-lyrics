<song artist="The_Ramones" title="Let's_Go">
Don't wanna study on the G.I. bill
Want more action, haven't had my fill 
Mercenary fight for anyone
Fight for money, fight for fun
Let's go
Got a country you wanna protect
But your army is more likely to defect
Hire my SMG with a full clip
On automatic it's a guaranteed hit
Let's go
Gee it's kinda scary out here
Mosquitos are happy tonight
Mommy, Daddy, can I please come home
Even if just for on night
Let's go
Shocked how deadly we fight back
Troublemakers who attack
Mercenary fight for anyone
Fight for money, fight for fun
Let's go
