<song artist="The_Ramones" title="Ignorance_Is_Bliss">
Ignorance is bliss, you know it's true
Ignorance is bliss, just look at you
Ignorance is bliss, didn't have a shoe
Ignorance is bliss, just look at you
Is it goin' anywhere?
Is it goin' anywhere?
Ignorance is bliss, you know it's true
Ignorance is bliss, just look at you
Ignorance is bliss, didn't have a shoe
Ignorance is bliss, just look at you
I'm alive I'm alive I'm alive, yeah
I'm alive I'm alive I'm alive, yeah
What's happenin' to our society?
Desintegration of humanity
Destruction of the enviroment
Cram that cop donation in your ass
Is it goin' anywhere?
Is it goin' anywhere?
See the waitress throwing attitude
Politicians to confuse you
What's good for them
Now it ain't good for you
But there ain't nothin' that you can do
I'm alive I'm alive I'm alive, yeah
I'm alive I'm alive I'm alive, yeah
I'm alive I'm alive I'm alive, yeah
I'm alive I'm alive I'm alive, yeah
I'm alive I'm alive I'm alive, yeah
I'm alive I'm alive I'm alive, yeah
Ignorance is bliss, you know it's true
Ignorance is bliss, just look at you
Ignorance is bliss, didn't have a shoe
Ignorance is bliss, just look at you
Ignorance is bliss, you know it's true
Ignorance is bliss, just look at you
Ignorance is bliss, didn't have a shoe
Ignorance is bliss, just look at you
I'm alive I'm alive I'm alive, yeah
I'm alive I'm alive I'm alive, yeah
I'm alive I'm alive I'm alive, yeah
I'm alive I'm alive I'm alive, yeah
I'm alive I'm alive I'm alive
