<song artist="The_Ramones" title="Why_Is_It_Always_This_Way?">
Hey, hey, hey
Why is it always this way?
Last time I saw her alive
She was wavin', wavin' bye-bye
She was contemplating suicide
Now she's lying
In a bottle of formaldehyde
And oh, I just don't know
Why I can't let her go
Oh, I just don't know
Hey, hey, hey
Why is it always this way?
Last time I saw her alive
She was going to the wash and dry
She was outside hitchin' a ride
Now she's lying
In a bottle of formaldehyde
