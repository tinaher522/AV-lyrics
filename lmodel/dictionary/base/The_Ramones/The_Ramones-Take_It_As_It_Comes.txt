<song artist="The_Ramones" title="Take_It_As_It_Comes">
Time to live, time to lie
Time to laugh, time to die
Take it easy baby
Take it as it comes
Don't move too fast
if you want your love to last
you've been moving much too fast
Time to walk, time to run
Time to aim your arrows at the sun
Take it easy baby
Take it as it comes
Don't move too fast
if you want your love to last
you've been moving much too fast
Go real slow
You'll like it more and more
Take it as it comes
Specialize in having fun
Take it easy baby
Take it as it comes
Don't move too fast
if you want your love to last
you've been moving much too fast
Moving much too fast
Moving much too fast
