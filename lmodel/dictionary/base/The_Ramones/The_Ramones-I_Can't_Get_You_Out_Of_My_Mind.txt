<song artist="The_Ramones" title="I_Can't_Get_You_Out_Of_My_Mind">
I can't get you out of my, my mind
Oh no no
I can't get you out of my mind
Oh no no
I can't get you out of my mind
I can't get you out of my mind
Oh no no, oh no no no
You said everything would be fine
Oh no no
You said everything would be fine
Oh no no no no
I can't get you out of my mind
I can't get you out of my mind
Oh no no
Well, I tried and I tried and I tried
I can't get you out, oh no no no
Well, I tried and I tried and I tried
I can't get you out, out of my mind
And I tried and I tried and I tried
I can't get you out, oh no no no no
Well, I tried and I tried and I tried
Can't get you out, out of my mind
Out of my mind
You said everything would be fine
Oh no no
You said everything would be fine
Oh no no no no
I can't get you out of my mind
I can't get you out of my mind
Oh no no, oh no no, oh no no
Oh no no, oh no no, oh no no
Oh no no, oh no no, oh no no
