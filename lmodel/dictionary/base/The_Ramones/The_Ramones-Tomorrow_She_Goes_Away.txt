<song artist="The_Ramones" title="Tomorrow_She_Goes_Away">
Infatuation, she's a fatal attraction
Hang around, screw up my mind
I hope I've seen her for the very last time
(Dangers of drinking), but I don't wanna die
Got to leave this cycle behind
I hope I've seen her for the very last time
And I can't wait 'til tomorrow
I can't wait another day
I can't wait 'til tomorrow
Tomorrow she goes away 
Over my shoulder, I keep looking back
I feel a presence following me
So I know I'll never be free
