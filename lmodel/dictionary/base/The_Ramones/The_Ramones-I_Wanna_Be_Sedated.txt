<song artist="The_Ramones" title="I_Wanna_Be_Sedated">
Twenty-twenty-twenty-four hours to go
I wanna be sedated
Nothing to do, nowhere to go-ho
I wanna be sedated
Just get me to the airport, and put me on a plane
Hurry, hurry, hurry, before I go insane
I can't control my fingers, I can't control my brain
Oh, no, oh, oh, oh, ho
Twenty-twenty-twenty-four hours to go
I wanna be sedated
Nothing to do, nowhere to go-ho
I wanna be sedated
Just put me in a wheelchair, and get me on a plane
Hurry, hurry, hurry, before I go insane
I can't control my fingers, I can't control my brain
Oh, no, oh, oh, oh, ho
Twenty-twenty-twenty-four hours to go
I wanna be sedated
Nothing to do, nowhere to go go-ho
I wanna be sedated
Just put me in a wheelchair, and get me to the show
Hurry, hurry, hurry, before I go loco
I can't control my fingers, I can't control my toes
Oh, no, oh, oh, oh, ho
Twenty-twenty-twenty-four hours to go
I wanna be sedated
Nothing to do, nowhere to go go-ho
I wanna be sedated
Just put me in a wheelchair, and get me to the show
Hurry, hurry, hurry, before I go loco
I can't control my fingers, I can't control my toes
Oh, no, oh, oh, oh, ho
Bah bah ba-bah, ba-bah bah ba-bah, I wanna be sedated 
Bah bah ba-bah, ba-bah bah ba-bah, I wanna be sedated 
Bah bah ba-bah, ba-bah bah ba-bah, I wanna be sedated 
Bah bah ba-bah, ba-bah bah ba-bah, I wanna be sedated
