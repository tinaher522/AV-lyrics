<song artist="The_Ramones" title="I_Can't_Be">
I can't be
Do what you want with me
I can't be
Do what you want with me
I can't be
Do what you want with me
I can't be
Do what you want with me
Now you say you wanna live with me
One-two-three, you wanna have a family
Now you say you wanna do my laundry
I can't be
Do what you want with me
I can't be
Do what you want with me
I can't be
Do what you want with me
I can't be
Do what you want with me
I can't be
Do what you want with me
I can't be
Do what you want with me
I can't be
Do what you want with me
I can't be
Do what you want with me
I can't be
Do what you want with me
