<song artist="The_Ramones" title="You_Should_Never_Have_Opened_That_Door">
Mama, where's your little daughter?
She's here, right here on the altar
You should never have opened that door
Now you're never gonna see her no more
You don't know what I can do with this axe
Chop off your head
So you better relax
You should never have opened that door
Now you're never gonna see her no more
You should never have opened that door
Now you're never gonna see her no more
Mama, where's your little daughter?
She's here, right here on the altar
You should never have opened that door
Now you're never gonna see her no more
You don't know what I can do with this axe
Chop off your head
So you better relax
You should never have opened that door
Now you're never gonna see her no more
You should never have opened that door
Now you're never gonna see her no more
Open that door...
