<song artist="The_Ramones" title="Have_You_Ever_Seen_The_Rain">
Someone told me long ago there's a calm before the storm,
I know; it's been comin' for some time
When it's over, so they say, it'll rain a sunny day,
I know; shinin' down like water
I want to know, have you ever seen the rain?
I want to know, have you ever seen the rain?
Comin' down on a sunny day
Yesterday, and days before, sun is cold and rain is hard,
I know; been that way for all my time
'Til forever, on it goes through the circle, fast and slow,
I know; it can't stop, I wonder
I want to know, have you ever seen the rain?
I want to know, have you ever seen the rain?
Comin' down on a sunny day
Yeah!
Someone told me long ago there's a calm before the storm,
I know; it's been comin' for some time
When it's over, so they say, it'll rain a sunny day,
I know; shinin' down like water
I want to know, have you ever seen the rain?
I want to know, have you ever seen the rain?
Comin' down on a sunny day
