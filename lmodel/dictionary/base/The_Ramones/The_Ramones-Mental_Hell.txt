<song artist="The_Ramones" title="Mental_Hell">
Evil in my head, in my head, inside this private hell I'm not feeling very well
I'm not feeling very well
Frustration, disgust, aggravation, disgust, mental hell I'm not feeling very well
I'm not feeling very well
Day, day after day, it never changes, always the same way
Day after day, day after day, day after
Demons in my head, in my head, inside this private hell Oh yeah, oh yeah I'm not feeling very well
I'm not feeling very well
Frustration, disgust, aggravation, disgust, mental hell Oh yeah, oh yeah I'm not feeling very well
I'm not feeling very well
Day, day after day, it never changes, always the same way
Day after day, day after day, day after
Do do do do Do do do do Do do do do Do do do do Do do do do Do do do do
Do do do do Do do do do Do do do do Do do do do Do do do do Do do do do
Do do do do Do do do do Do do do do Do do do do
Mental Hell Mental
Hell Mental Hell
