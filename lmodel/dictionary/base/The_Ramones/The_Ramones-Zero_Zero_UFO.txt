<song artist="The_Ramones" title="Zero_Zero_UFO">
It landed in a field in Idaho 
Where it came from, I don't know
It did not look like it came from Japan 
And out of the dark walked a strange man
If you think it's a pack of lies, 
I saw it happen with my own eyes
A million miles from the milky way 
A hundred years, a month and a day
Zero Zero UFO 
Zero Zero UFO
When meteorites hit the neon lights 
Spaceships travel at the speed of light
A million stars in the sky 
I here the Queen's on the alien's side
If you think it's a pack of lies, 
I saw it happen with my own eyes
A million miles from the milky way 
A hundred years, a month, and a day

Zero Zero UFO Zero Zero UFO
Zero Zero UFO Zero Zero UFO Hey
