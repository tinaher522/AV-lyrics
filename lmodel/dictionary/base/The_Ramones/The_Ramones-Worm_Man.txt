<song artist="The_Ramones" title="Worm_Man">
I'm a worm man I'm fed up
There's no hope I wanna puke I want some dirt
I'm a w-w-w-worm man.
Gonna crawl in a hole nobody's my friend
I'm no good to anyone I want some dirt
I'm a w-w-w-worm man
Well all right, well all right
Well all right, well all right
Well all right, well all right
Well all right...hey!
I'm no good to anyone nobody's my friend
I'll never be happy I hate myself
br&gt; I wish I was dead I wish I was dead I
I wish I was dead
