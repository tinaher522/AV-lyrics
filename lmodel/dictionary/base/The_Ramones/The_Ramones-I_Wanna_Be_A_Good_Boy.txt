<song artist="The_Ramones" title="I_Wanna_Be_A_Good_Boy">
I just want to be a good boy, I don't want to be bad
Now I wanna run away from home, now I wanna be on my own
I just want to be a good boy, I don't want to be bad
Now I wanna run away from home, now I wanna be all alone
I just want to be a good boy, I don't want to be bad
Now I wanna run away from home, now I wanna be on my own
I just want to be a good boy, I don't want to be bad
Now I wanna run away from home now I wanna be all alone
