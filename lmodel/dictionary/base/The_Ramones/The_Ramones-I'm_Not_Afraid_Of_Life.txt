<song artist="The_Ramones" title="I'm_Not_Afraid_Of_Life">
I'm not afraid of life
Of the poor man's struggle
Of the killer's knife
I'm not afraid of life
Of an insane rage
Of the minimum wage
I'm not afraid of life
I'm not afraid of life
I'm not afraid of life
But I see an old lady with a shopping bag
And I wonder is life a drag
I'm not afraid of pain
But it hurts so bad
I feel so mad
No one sees the truth
There's nothing to gain
A life goes down the drain
I don't want to die at an early age
I'm not afraid of life
I'm not afraid of life
But I see a street crazy shivering cold
Is it a crime to be old
There's the threat of the nuclear bomb
We know it's wrong
We know it's wrong
Is there a chance for peace
Will the fighting ever cease
Mankind's almost out of luck
A maniac could blow us up
I'm not afraid of life
I'm not afraid of life
But I get on my knees and I pray
Is there hope for the world today
