<song artist="The_Ramones" title="You_Didn't_Mean_Anything_To_Me">
Skies were cloudy everyday nothing wanted to grow
We had our last chance I think I told you so
Every dinner was crummy nothing was on T.V.
I was ready to pack it up our heads were so achey
You didn't mean anything to me
You didn't mean anything to me
We got to get away another lawn to mow
We had our last chance I think I told you so
Every dinner was crummy even the ones for free
I was ready to pack it up forget the agony
You didn't mean anything to me
You didn't mean anything to me
Everybody was cranky even the maids were mean
We ran into a miracle there was beer in the soda
Machine every dinner was crummy even the ones for
Free I was ready to pack it up forget the agony
You didn't mean anything to me
You didn't mean anything to me
You didn't mean anything to me
You didn't mean anything to me
