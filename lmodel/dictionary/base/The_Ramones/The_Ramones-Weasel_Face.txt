<song artist="The_Ramones" title="Weasel_Face">
Twenty four hours ago no one could help me
I'm alone in life no where to go
So I picked up the phone called out for help
Some one please help me I'm afraid and alone
Weasel face Weasel face Weasel face
It's way past midnight T.V. set is on
It's my only friend one crisis after another
Ain't no loser or quitter it's all or nothing baby
'Cause we fought so hard for our piece of this world
Weasel face Weasel face Weasel face
