<song artist="The_Ramones" title="Now_I_Wanna_Be_A_Good_Boy">
Now I wanna be a good boy
I don't wanna be bad
Now I wanna run away from home
Now I wanna be on my own
I just wanna be a good boy
I don't wanna be bad
Now I wanna run away from home
Now I wanna be sad alone
Now I wanna be a good boy
I don't wanna be bad
Now I wanna run away from home
Now I wanna be all alone now
Now I wanna be a good boy
I don't wanna be bad
Now I wanna run away from home
Now I wanna be on my own
