Sha-la-la-la
Sha-la-la-la-la
Sha-la-la-la
Sha-la-la-la-la
Sha-la-la-la
Sha-la-la-la-la
Ships are docking
Planes are landing
A never ending supply
No more narco
No more gangster
Conservatives can cry
I took the law and threw it away
'Cause there's nothing wrong, it's just for play
There's no law, no law anymore
I want to steal from the rich and give to the poor
Sha-la-la-la
Sha-la-la-la-la
Sha-la-la-la
Sha-la-la-la-la
It was glowing
Glowing, glowing
Glowing in the dark
It was sparkling
Sparkling, sparkling
Sparkling in the night
I took the law and threw it away
'Cause there's nothing wrong, it's just for play
There's no law, no law anymore
I want to steal from the rich and give to the poor
Winter turns to summer
Sadness turns to fun
Keep the faith, baby
You broke the rules and won
Sha-la-la-la
Sha-la-la-la-la
Sha-la-la-la
Sha-la-la-la-la
Sha-la-la-la
Sha-la-la-la-la
Keep it glowing
Glowing, glowing
I'm not hurting anyone
Keep it glowing
Smoking, glowing
I'm howling at the moon
I took the law and threw it away
'Cause there's nothing wrong, it's just for play
There's no law, no law anymore
I want to steal from the rich and give to the poor
Oh baby
Oh baby
Oh baby
Oh baby
I took the law and threw it away
'Cause there's nothing wrong, it's just for play
I'm smoking, baby
I'm smoking, oh baby
There's no law, no law anymore
I want to steal from the rich and give to the poor
Sha-la-la-la
Sha-la-la-la-la
Sha-la-la-la
Sha-la-la-la-la
Sha-la-la-la
Sha-la-la-la-la
Sha-la-la-la
Sha-la-la-la-la-la
Sha-la-la-la
Sha-la-la-la-la-la
Sha-la-la-la
Sha-la-la-la-la-la
Sha-la-la-la
Sha-la-la-la-la-la
