<song artist="The_Ramones" title="I_Can't_Make_It_On_Time">
I can't make it on time.
I can't make it on time.
I keep tryin' and tryin'
I can't make it on time.
I can't hurry and you can't wait. 
It doesn't matter 'cause we're already late.
I can't get off the telephone.
It always rings when I'm alone.
You gotta wait wait 
'cause you don't need no one. 
Wait wait, 
'cause you know that I'm the one.
You gotta wait. Hey, hey' hey. Wait.
