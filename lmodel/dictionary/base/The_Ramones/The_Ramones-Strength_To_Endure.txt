<song artist="The_Ramones" title="Strength_To_Endure">
Walking through the cross fire heart
Feeling heavy and hopeless
Wonderin' how I ever will see through this darkness
Every drop of blood can be so beautiful
And I sure was bleedin' the drops by the bucketful
I have the strength to endure
And all the love so pure
I have the strength to endure
Because, because...
I'm not afraid to tell her
Just how things work
Ride a hurricane through the fast lane
Always looking over my shoulder
She said, "there's something about you, and neon lights always glow hot
Baby we can see this through
Just give all the strenght you've got"
I have the strength to endure
And all the love so pure
I have the strength to endure
Because, because...
I'm not afraid to tell her
Just how things work
Ride a hurricane through the fast lane
Always looking over my shoulder
She said, "there's something about you, and neon lights always glow hot
Baby we can see this through
Just give all the strenght you've got"
I have the strength to endure
And all the love so pure
I have the strength to endure
Because, because...
