<song artist="The_Ramones" title="I_Don't_Want_This_Life_(Anymore)">
And now that you're gone I feel the pain
My heart trembles, I call your name
I miss your touch, your soft blonde hair
I keep searching for an answer but it just ain't there
And I don't want to live this life
And I don't want to live this life
And I don't want to live this life anymore
Everywhere I turn, the finger points at me
You'll never understand, I'm in misery
'Cause baby without you I have no one
Oh my sweet darling what have I done
And I don't want to live this life
And I don't want to live this life
And I don't want to live this life anymore, alright
She smiled at me as I held her carefully
Her last words were I love you, thought it set me free
And I can't forget that look on her face
It looked like an angel as she died in my embrace
And I don't want to live this life
And I don't want to live this life
And I don't want to live this life anymore
And I don't want to live this life
And I don't want to live this life
And I don't want to live this life anymore
And I don't want to live this life
And I don't want to live this life
And I don't want to live this life anymore
