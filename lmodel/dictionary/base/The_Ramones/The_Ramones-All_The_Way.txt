<song artist="The_Ramones" title="All_The_Way">
Feedback blasting out my ears makes me so high. 
I love all the monitor men but why are they alive. 
The van is making me crazy. 
It's just like being in the navy.
Doomsday, doomsda's coming 1981.
But until things blow I'm gonna have some fun. 
The bubble's going to explode.
Probably never live to get old.
But I just wanna have some fun. 
Probably won't see no money. 
I just wanna have some fun.
Before they throw me in the sanitarium.
