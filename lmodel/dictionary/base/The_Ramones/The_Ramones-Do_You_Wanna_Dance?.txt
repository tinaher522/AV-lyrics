<song artist="The_Ramones" title="Do_You_Wanna_Dance?">
Do you wanna dance and hold my hand?
Tell me baby I'm your lover man
Oh baby, do you wanna dance? 
Well do you wanna dance under the moonlight?
Squeeze me baby all through the night
Oh baby, do you wanna dance?
Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance?
Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance?
Do you, do you, do you
Do you wanna dance?
