<song artist="The_Ramones" title="I_Know_Better_Now">
Nobody can tell me I know
I know better now
You're a kid, you're a brat
Clean up your room, throw out the trash
When I was your age, I heard it all
Like livin' under your marshall law
I would think it was for my own good
I would think it was true
Nobody can tell me I know
I know better now
Gotta be in early, gotta go to school
They don't like my friends, I don't like those rules
I'm not a criminal, I'm not on drugs
Don't wait up for me, I'm out havin' fun
I would think it was for my own good
I would think it was true
Nobody can tell me I know
I know better now
Nobody can tell me I know
I know better now...
