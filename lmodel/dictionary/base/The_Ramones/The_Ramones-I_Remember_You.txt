<song artist="The_Ramones" title="I_Remember_You">
I remember you, ooh
I remember you, ooh
I remember you, ooh
I remember lyin' awake at night
And thinkin' just of you
But things don't last forever
And somehow baby, they never really do
They never really do
I remember you, ooh 
I remember you, ooh
I remember you, ooh
I remember lyin' awake at night
And thinkin' just of you
But things don't last forever
And somehow baby, they never really do
They never really do
I remember you, ooh
I remember you, ooh
I remember you, oooh
I remember you
I remember you
I remember you
I remember you 
You, I remember you
I remember you, ooh
I remember you, ooh
I remember lyin' awake at night
And thinkin' just of you
But things don't last forever
And somehow baby, they never really do
They never really do
I remember you, ooh 
I remember you, ooh
I remember you
I remember you
I remember you
