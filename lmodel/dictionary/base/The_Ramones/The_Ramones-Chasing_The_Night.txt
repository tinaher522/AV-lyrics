<song artist="The_Ramones" title="Chasing_The_Night">
Standing here in front of the mirror
It's going to be all right tonight
Feelin' hot, yeah, I'm on fire
I'm never ever going to tire
Tonight, it's gonna be all right
Chasing the night 
It's gonna be all right
Chasing the night
Chasing, chasing the night
It's going to be all right
Live my life as I choose
I paid the price, paid my dues
You know I need no alibi
Daytime troubles fading
Nights intoxicating
Gonna have it all tonight
That ain't no lie
Tonight, it's gonna be all right
Chasing the night
It's gonna be all right
Chasing the night
Chasing, chasing the night 
It's goin to be all right
Rock all night, sleep all day
It don't matter what they say
Ain't never gonna change my ways
And I wont be back till Monday
Feeling exasperating
Excitement generating
I'm never gonna tire
City overloading
The circuts are exploading
Ain't coming down no, I'm too wierd
