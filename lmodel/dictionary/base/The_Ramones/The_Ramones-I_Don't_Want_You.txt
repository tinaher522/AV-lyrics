<song artist="The_Ramones" title="I_Don't_Want_You">
You said that you'd be true Baby said that you'd be true
I don't care, I don't care I don't care, I don't care
I don't want you Don't want you I don't want you anymore
You said that you'd be mine Baby said that you'd be mine
I don't care, I don't care I don't care, I don't care
I don't want you Don't want you I don't want you
I want you, I want you I want you to stay
But I guess that you'd be true I don't care, I don't care I don't care, I don't care
I don't want you Don't want want you I don't want you anymore
