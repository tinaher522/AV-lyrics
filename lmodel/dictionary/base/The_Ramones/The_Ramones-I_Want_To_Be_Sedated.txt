<song artist="The_Ramones" title="I_Want_To_Be_Sedated">
Twenty, twenty, twenty four hours to go I wanna be sedated
Nothin' to do, no where to go, oh, I wanna be sedated
Just get me to the airport put me on a plane
Hurry, hurry, hurry before I go insane
I can't control my fingers, I can't control my brain
Oh no, oh, oh, oh, oh
Twenty, twenty, twenty four hours to go I wanna be sedated
Nothin' to do, no where to go, oh, I wanna be sedated
Just put me in a wheelchair get me on a plane
Hurry, hurry, hurry before I go insane
I can't control my fingers, I can't control my brain
Oh no, oh, oh, oh, oh
Twenty, twenty, twenty four hours to go I wanna be sedated
Nothin' to do, no where to go, oh, I wanna be sedated
Just put me in a wheelchair, get me to the show
Hurry, hurry, hurry before I go loco
I can't control my fingers, I can't control my toes
Oh no, oh, oh, oh, oh
Twenty, twenty, twenty four hours to go I wanna be sedated
Nothin' to do, no where to go, oh I wanna be sedated
Just put me in a wheelchair, get me to the show
Hurry, hurry, hurry before I go loco
I can't control my fingers, I can't control my toes
Oh no, oh, oh, oh, oh
Bamp bamp, ba bamp, ba bamp bamp, ba bamp, I wanna be sedated
Bamp bamp, ba bamp, ba bamp bamp, ba bamp, I wanna be sedated
Bamp bamp, ba bamp, ba bamp bamp, ba bamp, I wanna be sedated
Bamp bamp, ba bamp, ba bamp bamp, ba bamp, I wanna be sedated
