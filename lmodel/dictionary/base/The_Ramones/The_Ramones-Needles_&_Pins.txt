<song artist="The_Ramones" title="Needles_&_Pins">
I saw her today, I saw her face it was a face I love
And I knew I had to run away and get down on my knees and pray that they go away
Still it begins needles and pins

<h2> Because of all my pride the tears I gotta hide</h2>
Oh I thought I was smart I stole her heart
Didnt think I do but now I see
Shes worse to him than me let her go ahead
Take his love instead and one day she will see just how to save me
And get down on her knees thats how it begins
Shell feel those needles and pins - oh, no - oh, no
Why cant I stop and tell myself Im wrong, Im wrong, so wrong
Why cant I stand up and tell myself Im strong because I saw her today
I saw her face it was a face I love
And I knew I had to run away and get down on my knees and pray that they go away
Still it begins needles and pins
Because of all my pride the tears I gotta hide
Hey! needles and pins needles and pins needles and pins
