<song artist="The_Ramones" title="I_Just_Wanna_Have_Something_To_Do">
Hanging out on Second Avenue
Eating chicken vindaloo
I just want to be with you
I just want to have something to do
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
Well allright
Wait-Now
Wait-Now
Hanging out all by myself
'Cause I don't want to be with anybody else
I just want to be with you
I just want to have something to do
Tonight
