<song artist="The_Ramones" title="Come_On_Now">
Come on now Come on now we got no wheels to race
Come on now Come on now police are every place
Come on now Come on now we got no skirts to chase
I'm just a junk food guy now I'm telling you why
I'm living at the matinee, yeah
I just want to sleep and play come on now
Come on now when the folks are not around
Come on now Come on now nagging 'bout the sound
Come on now Come on now to turn that racket down
I'm just a comic book boy there's nothing scary
To enjoy freak admission stroll inside
I was born on a roller coaster ride
Come on now Come on now we got no wheels to race
Come on now Come on now police are every place
Come on now Come on now we got no skirts to chase
I'm just a comic book boy there's nothing scary
To enjoy freak admission stroll inside
I was born on a roller coaster ride
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah come on now
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah come on now
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah come on now
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah come on now
