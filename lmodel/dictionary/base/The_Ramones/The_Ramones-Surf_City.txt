(J Berry/B Wilson)
Two girls for every boy. (While this line was sung on the original, 
Johnny's guitar plays this as a melody)
I bought a '34 wagon and we call it a woodie
Surf City, here we come
You know, it's not very cherry, it's an oldie but a goodie
Surf City, here we come
Well, it ain't got a backseat or a rear window
But it still gets me where I wanna go
And we're goin' Surf City, 'Cause it's two to one
You know we're goin' Surf City, gonna have some fun
Yeah we're goin' Surf City, 'cause it's two to one
You know we're goin' Surf City, gonna have some fun, now
They say they never roll the streets up, 'cause there's always something goin'
Surf City, here we come
You know, they're either out surfin' or they got a party growin'
Surf City, here we come
Well it's two swingin' honeys for every guy
And all you gotta do is just wink your eye
And we're goin' Surf City, 'Cause it's two to one
You know we're goin' Surf City, gonna have some fun
Yeah we're goin' Surf City, 'cause it's two to one
You know we're goin' Surf City, gonna have some fun, now
Two girls for every boy
And if my woody breaks down on me somewhere on that Surf Route
Surf City, here we come
I'll strap my board to my back and hitch a ride in my wet-suit
Surf City, here we come
And when I get to Surf City, I'll be shootin' the curl
And checkin' out the parties for surfer girls
