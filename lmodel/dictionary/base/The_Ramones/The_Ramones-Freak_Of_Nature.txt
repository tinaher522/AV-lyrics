Freak Freak Freak Freak
I need psychiatric therapy I could use a lobotomy
Guess I'll never learn Suppose I'll always be a worm
Freak of nature Freak of nature Freak of nature Freak of nature
Got a ten inch erection, a pimply complexion
Man I got problems, I'll bet you heard I'm completely misunderstood
Fa Fa Fa Fa Fa Fa Fa Fa Fa Fa Fa Fa
I'm a monstrosity I'm a human oddity
Everybody's staring at me I'm an outcast from society
Freak of nature Freak of nature Freak of nature Freak of nature
Fa Fa Fa Fa Fa Fa Fa Fa Fa Fa
