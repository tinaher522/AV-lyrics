<song artist="The_Ramones" title="We_Want_The_Airwaves">
Nine to five, and five to nine
Ain't gonna take it, it's our time
We want the world, and we want it now
We're gonna take it anyhow
We want the airwaves
We want the airwaves
We want the airwaves, baby
If rock is gonna stay alive
Oh yeah
well alright
Let's rock
tonight
All night
Oh yeah
well alright
Let's rock
tonight
All night
Where's your guts and will to survive
And don't you wanna keep rock 'n' roll music alive
Mr. Programmer, I got my hammer
And I'm gonna smash my, smash my brain!
We want the airwaves
We want the airwaves
We want the airwaves, baby
If rock is gonna stay alive
Oh yeah
well alright
Let's rock
tonight
All night
Oh yeah
well alright
Let's rock
tonight
All night
We want the airwaves airwaves
We want the airwaves airwaves
We want the airwaves airwaves
We want the airwaves airwaves
We want the airwaves, baby
