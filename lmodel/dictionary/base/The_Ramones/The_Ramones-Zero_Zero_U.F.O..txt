<song artist="The_Ramones" title="Zero_Zero_U.F.O.">
It landed in a field in Idaho
Where it came from, I don't know
It did not look like it came from Japan
And out of the dark walked a strange man
If you think it's a pack of lies
I saw it happen with my own eyes
A million miles from the milky way
A hundred years, a month, and a day
Zero zero UFO, zero zero UFO
When media writes the neon lights
Spaceship travels at the speed of light
A million stars in the sky
I here the Queen's on the alien's side
If you think it's a pack of lies
I saw it happen with my own eyes
A million miles from the milky way
A hundred years, a month, and a day
Hey
Zero zero UFO, zero zero UFO, zero zero UFO, zero zero UFO
Hey
