<song artist="The_Ramones" title="She's_A_Sensation">
She's a sensation
She's a sensation
She looks a so sweet
She's a sensation 
She's a sensation
Good enough a to eat
She's a sensation
oh-oh-oh
She looks a so fine 
She's a sensation 
She's a Sensation 
I'm gonna make her mine
No matter what you do (you do)
I give my heart to you (to you)
And oh-oh-baby 
I will give to you 
no matter What they say (they say)
yeah, we can find a way (a way)
And oh-oh-baby we can find a way
I didn't know it till I walked you home
That, I feel the way I do 
and I don't care
What the neighbors say 
I always will be true
I always will love you 
love you a-wo-wo-wo-wo
(repeat all)
