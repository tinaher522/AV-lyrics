<song artist="The_Ramones" title="This_Business_Is_Killing_Me">
I'm sick to death, I'm a nervous wreck
This business is killing me, you know
This business is killing me, you know
It's really killing me, yeah
I'm sick to death, I'm a nervous wreck
This business is killing me, you know
This business is killing me, you know
It's really killing me, yeah
Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no
Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no, ho
This business is killing me and so they say
Run around, run around
Love giving you the run around
It really makes you crazy
Run around, run around
Love giving you the run around
Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no
Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no
This business is killing me and so they say, hey, hey
You work, you work, you write all night
Until the early morning light
Can't please all the people, all the time
All the people, all the time
But they don't please me
Well, I can't take it no more
No, I can't take it no more
Run around, run around, run around, run around
Wee, I can't take it no more
No. I can't take it
