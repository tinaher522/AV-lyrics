<song artist="The_Ramones" title="Chainsaw">
Sittin' here with nothin' to do
Sittin' here thinkin' only of you
But you'll never get out of there
She'll never get out of there
Sittin' here with nothin' to do
Sittin' here thinkin' only of you
But you'll never get out of there
She'll never get out of there I don't care
Texas chain saw massacre
They took my baby away from me
But you'll never get out of there
She'll never get out of there
Texas chain saw massacre
Took my baby away from me
But you'll never get out of there
She'll never get out of there I don't care
When I saw her, on the corner
She told me, told me, told me, told me she wouldn't go for
Now I know I'm so much in love
'Cause she's the only girl that I'm ever thinkin' of
Texas chain saw massacre
They took my baby away from me
But you'll never get out of there
She'll never get out of there
Texas chain saw massacre
Took my baby away from me
But you'll never get out of there
They tought her up and I don't care, don't care
Texas chain saw massacre
Texas chain saw massacre
Oh no, oh no
