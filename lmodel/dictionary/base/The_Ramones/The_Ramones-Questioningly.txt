<song artist="The_Ramones" title="Questioningly">
Questioningly
Her eyes looked at me
And then she spoke, Aren't you someone I used to know
And weren't we lovers a long time ago?
Looked at her close
Forced her into view
Yes, I said, you're a girl that I once may have knew
But I don't love you anymore
Why do you want to talk to me for?
You should have just let me walk by
Memories make us cry
In the morning I'm at work on time
My boss tells me that I'm doing fine
When I'm going home
Whiskey bottle, movie on TV
Memories make me cry
And I'm alone just me, just me
Questioningly
