<song artist="The_Ramones" title="We're_A_Happy_Family">
We're a happy family
We're a happy family
We're a happy family
Me, Mom and Daddy
We're a happy family
We're a happy family
We're a happy family
Me, Mom and Daddy
Sitting here in Queens
Eating refried beans
We're in all the magazines
Gulpin' down thorazines
We ain't got no friends
Our troubles never end
No Christmas cards to send
Daddy likes men
Daddy's telling lies
Baby's eating flies
Mommy's on pills
Baby's got the chills
I'm friends with the President
I'm friends with the Pope
We're all making a fortune
Selling Daddy's dope
Sitting here in Queens
Eating refried beans
We're in all the magazines
Gulpin' down thorazines
We ain't got no friends
Our troubles never end
No Christmas cards to send
Daddy likes men
We're a happy family
We're a happy family
We're a happy family
Me, Mom and Daddy
We're a happy family
We're a happy family
We're a happy family
Me, Mom and Daddy
