(applause)
[Smithers]Here are several fine young men who I'm sure are gonna go far, Ladies and Gentlemen...The Ramones
(applause)
[Burns]Ei, these minstrals will sooth my jangled nerves
I'd just like to say this gig sucks
hey, up yours Springfied
1 2 3 4
Happy Birthday to you (Happy Birthday)
Happy Birthday to you (Happy Birthday)
Happy Birthday Burnsey, Happy Birthday to you 
go to hell you old bastard
Hey I think they liked us
[Burns]have the rolling Stones killed
[Smithers]But sir those arn't
[Burns]Do as I Say
