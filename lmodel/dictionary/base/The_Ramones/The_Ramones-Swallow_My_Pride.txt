<song artist="The_Ramones" title="Swallow_My_Pride">
Winter is here and it's going on two years
Swallow my pride
And things were looking very grim but they're looking good again
Swallow my pride
Loose lips sink ships, they say
But isn't it always that way?
Swallow my pride, oh yeah'
Swallow my pride, oh yeah
Swallow my pride, oh yeah
Winter is here and it's going on two years
Swallow my pride
And things were looking grim but they're looking good again
Swallow my pride
Gonna have a real cool time and everything's gonna be real fine
Swallow my pride, oh yeah
Winter is here and it's going on two years
Swallow my pride
And things were looking very grim but they're looking good again
Swallow my pride
Gonna have a real cool time and everything's gonna be real fine
Swallow my pride, oh yeah
