<song artist="The_Ramones" title="Carbona_Not_Glue">
Wondering what I'm doing tonight
I've been in the closet and feel all right
Ran out of Carbona, Mom threw out the glue
Ran out of paint and roach spray too
It's TV's fault why I am this way
Mom and Pop wanna put me away
From the early morning movie to the late late show
After it's over, nowhere to go
And I'm not sorry for the things I do
My brain is stuck from shooting glue
I'm not sorry for the things I do
Carbona not glue
Carbona not glue
Carbona not glue
Carbona not glue
Wondering what I'm doing tonight
I've been in the closet and feel all right
Ran out of Carbona, Mom threw out the glue
Ran out of paint and roach spray too
It's TV's fault why I am this way
Mom and Pop wanna put me away
From the early morning movie to the late late show
After it's over nowhere to go
Carbona not glue
Carbona not glue
Carbona not glue...
