<song artist="The_Ramones" title="In_The_Park">
All dressed up an' the sun sets low when the
Big bright moon shines a friendly hello
When my heart pants with lust like a Rome
Like I am all messed up when the fireflies glow
I just wanna cuss and fight I am goin' out tonight
Everything is out of sight it's gonna be all right
I'm gonna hang out in the park hang out after dark
I'm gonna be with the gang tonight
Under street lamps I will play after the school day
When the troubles disappear I feel excitement is here
Kids in cars were cruisin' by the big bright moon
Smiles in the sky music playin' that portable sound
Everybody's hangin' all around
I'm gonna hang out in the park hang out after dark
I'm gonna be with the gang tonight
I'm gonna be with the gang tonight
I'm gonna be with the gang tonight
