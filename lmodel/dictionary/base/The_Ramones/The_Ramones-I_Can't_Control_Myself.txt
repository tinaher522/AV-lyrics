I can't stand still cause you've got me goin'                                                  
Your slacks are low and your hips are showin'                                                   
I take you girl as you're standing there                                                       
Your low cut slacks and your long black hair                                                   
Don't want you goin' round with no one else                                                    
'cause when I'm with you I can't control myself                                                
Defense is down and you've got me shakin'                                                      
You've got me so that my nerves are breakin'                                                    
If you got me, I like you girl                                                                 
Your knees would bend and your hair will curl                                                  
You make me move, yeah, like no one else                                                       
'cause when I'm with you I can't control myself                                                
I've got this feeling that's inside of me                                                      
It makes me think of how things used to be                                                     
It makes me fell allright                                                                      
When I'm with you at night and we love                                                         
You hold me so with this quick temptation                                                      
This kind of feeling could move a nation                                                        
And I'm okay when I'm here with you                                                            
I do the things that you want me to                                                            
But do these things for no one else                                                            
'Cause when I'm with you I can't control myself                                                
I can't control myself                                                                         
I can't control myself                                                                         
I can't control myself                                                                         
I can't control myself                                                                         
I can't control myself, baby
