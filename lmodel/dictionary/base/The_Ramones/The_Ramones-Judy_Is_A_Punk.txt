<song artist="The_Ramones" title="Judy_Is_A_Punk">
Jackie is a punk
Judy is a runt
They both went down to Berlin
Joined the Ice Capades
And oh, I don't know why
Oh, I don't know why
Perhaps they'll die
Oh yeah
Perhaps they'll die
Oh yeah
Perhaps they'll die
Oh yeah
Perhaps they'll die
Oh yeah
Second verse, same as the first
Jackie is a punk
Judy is a runt
They both went down to Berlin
Joined the Ice Capades
And oh, I don't know why
Oh, I don't know why
Perhaps they'll die
Oh yeah
Perhaps they'll die
Oh yeah
Perhaps they'll die
Oh yeah
Perhaps they'll die
Oh yeah
Third verse, different from the first
Jackie is a punk
Judy is a runt
They both went down to Frisco
Joined the SLA
And oh, I don't know why
Oh, I don't know why
Perhaps they'll die
Oh yeah
Perhaps they'll die
Oh yeah
Perhaps they'll die
Oh yeah
Perhaps they'll die
Oh yeah!
