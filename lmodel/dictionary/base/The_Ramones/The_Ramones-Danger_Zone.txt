<song artist="The_Ramones" title="Danger_Zone">
New York is a real cool town Sociey really
Brings me down Our playground is a pharmacy
Kids find trouble so easily
Other countries are just so bad The soviets really
Make me mad on the boulevard where the police hide
Let's steal a car for a joyride
They say you're just an awkward kid
You flipped your lid you flipped your lid
You love wine like they love cash
Feel your rage spread like a rash
You flipped your lid You flipped your lid
You flipped your lid You flipped your lid
They say you're just an awkward kid
You flipped your lid You flipped your lid
All alone in the danger zone danger zone danger zone
All alone in the danger zone danger zone danger zone
