<song artist="The_Ramones" title="Chinese_Rock">
Somebody called me on the phone
Say, "Hey, hey, is Arty home?
You wanna take a walk?
You wanna go cop?
You wanna go get some Chinese rock?"
I'm living on a Chinese rock
All my best things are in hock
I'm living on a Chinese rock
Everything is in the pawn shop
The plaster's falling off the wall
My girlfriend's crying in the shower stall
It's hot as a bitch
I should've been rich
But I'm just digging a Chinese ditch
I'm living on a Chinese rock
All my best things are in hock
I'm living on a Chinese rock
Everything is in the pawn shop
Ooh, ah
Ooh, ah
The plaster's falling off the wall
My girlfriend's crying in the shower stall
It's hot as a bitch
I should've been rich
But I'm just digging a Chinese ditch
I'm living on a Chinese rock
All my best things are in hock
I'm living on a Chinese rock
Everything is in the pawn shop
I'm living on a Chinese rock
I'm living on a Chinese rock
I'm living on a Chinese rock
I'm living on a Chinese rock
