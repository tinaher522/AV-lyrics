<song artist="The_Ramones" title="All's_Quiet_On_The_Eastern_Front">
Watch the watch the way I walk
Can't you think my movements talk
Watch the watch the way I walk
Can't you think my movements talk
See me silently quietly creep I am too
amped up to sleep lamp rays shining down
Street lamps make the bussing sound subway
Creaking down below garbage piled up and ready to go
Lock the windows the gates on taxi in the
Distance coming along stalking the streets
Till the break of day New York beauty take my
Breath away near some cats but dog's don't
bark cool cats strolling after dark
Watch the watch the way I walk
Can't you think my movements talk
Watch the watch the way I walk
Can't you think my movements talk
Shaky lock and kicky door smokey air that
I adore down in the alley is where I hunt
All is quiet on the eastern front
Stalking the streets till the break of day
New York beauty take my breath away
Watch the watch the way I walk
Can't you think my movements talk
Watch the watch the way I walk
Can't you think my movements talk
Can't you think my movements talk
Can't you think my movements talk
