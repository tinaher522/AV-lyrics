<song artist="The_Ramones" title="No_Go">
I got a call late saturday night alright
Yeah I got a call late saturday alright
Beat, dead, burnt out from the night before
I wanted to go but couldn't take it no more
I got a call late saturday night alright
Yeah I got a call late saturday alright
Beat, dead, burnt out you know what I mean
My brain was racin but my feet wouldn't scream.
Let's go Let's go
Oh oh oh oh Oh oh oh oh Oh oh oh oh Oh oh oh
My brain was racin but my feet wouldn't go
Let's fly Let's fly

My brain was racin but my feet wouldn't fly

Beat, dead, burnt out from the night before
I wanted to go but couldn't take it no more
I got a call late saturday night alright
Yeah I got a call late saturday night alright
Beat, dead, burnt out you know what I mean
My brain was racin but my feet wouldn't scream.
