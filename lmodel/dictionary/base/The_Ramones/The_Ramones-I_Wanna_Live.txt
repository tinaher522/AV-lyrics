<song artist="The_Ramones" title="I_Wanna_Live">
I've been thinking it over
And I know just what to do
I've been thinking it over
And I know I just can't trust myself
I'm a Gypsy prince
Covered with diamonds and jewels
But then my lover exposes me
I know I'm just a damn fool
CHORUS:
I give what I've got to give,
I give what I need to live
I give what I've got to give, it's important if I want to live
I wanna live
I want to live my life
I wanna live
I want to live my life
As I load my pistol
Of fine German steel
I never thought I'd be so down and out
Having my last meal
But I know I can do it
It just took a few years
As I execute my killers
The morning is near
CHORUS
I wanna live
I want to live my life
I wanna live
I wanna live my life
I wanna live
I want to live my life
I wanna live
I wanna live my life
