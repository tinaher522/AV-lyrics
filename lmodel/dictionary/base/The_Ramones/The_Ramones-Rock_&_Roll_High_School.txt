<song artist="The_Ramones" title="Rock_&_Roll_High_School">
Rock, rock, rock, rock, rock 'n' roll high school
Well, I don't care about history
Rock, rock, rock 'n' roll high school
'Cause that's not where I wanna be
Rock, rock, rock 'n' roll high school
I just wanna have some kicks
I just wanna get some chicks
Rock, rock, rock, rock, rock 'n' roll high school
Well, the girls out there knock me out, you know
Rock, rock, rock 'n' roll high school
Cruisin' around in my G T O
Rock, rock, rock 'n' roll high school
I hate the teachers and the principal
Don't wanna be taught to be no fool
Rock, rock, rock, rock, rock 'n' roll high school
Rock, rock, rock, rock, rock 'n' roll high school
Fun, fun, rock 'n roll high school
Fun, fun, rock 'n' roll high school
Fun, fun, rock 'n' roll high school
Fun, fun, oh baby, fun, fun, oh baby
Fun, fun, fun, fun
Rock, rock, rock, rock, rock 'n' roll high school
Rock, rock, rock, rock, rock 'n' roll high school
Rock, rock, rock, rock, rock 'n' roll high school
I don't care about history
Rock, rock, rock 'n' roll high school
'Cause that's not where I wanna be
Rock, rock, rock 'n' roll high school
I just wanna have some kicks
I just wanna get some chicks
Rock, rock, rock, rock, rock 'n' roll high school
Rock, rock, rock, rock, rock 'n' roll high school
Fun, fun, rock 'n' roll high school
Fun, fun, rock 'n' roll high school
Fun, fun, rock 'n' roll high school
Fun, fun, oh baby, fun, fun, oh baby
Fun, fun, fun, fun
Rock, rock, rock, rock, rock 'n' roll high school
Rock, rock, rock, rock, rock 'n' roll high school
Rock, rock, rock, rock, rock 'n' roll high school
Rock, rock, rock, rock, rock 'n' roll high school
