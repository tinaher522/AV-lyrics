<song artist="The_Ramones" title="It's_Not_My_Place_(In_The_9_To_5_World)">
My mom and dad are always fighting
And it's getting very un-exciting
To get a good job 
You need the proper schooling
Now who the hell
Do you think you're fooling
But it's not my place oh-no
No it's not my place no no 
No it's not my-not my-not my place
In the 9 to 5 world
And it's not my place 
In the 9 to 5 world
And it's not my place 
With 9 to 5 girl
It's not my place
In the 9 to 5 world
Hangin' out with Lester Bangs you all
And Phil Spector really has it all
Uncle Floyd shows on the T.V.
Jack Nicholson, Clint Eastwood, 10cc
But it's not my place
Don't wanna be a working stiff
Lose my identity
Cause when it comes 
To working 9 to 5
There ain't no place for me
Ain't my reality, to me
Vin Scelsa's on the radio
Ramones are hangin' out in Kokomo
Roger Corman's on a talk show 
With Allan Arkush and Stephen King, you know
But it's not my place
