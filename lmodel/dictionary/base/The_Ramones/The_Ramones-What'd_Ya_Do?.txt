<song artist="The_Ramones" title="What'd_Ya_Do?">
A Koo Koo Koo I don't care about you no more
A Koo Koo Koo I don't care about you no more
You used to make me happy but what'd ya do?
You better go now I think you better go now, baby
I don't want you hanging around my door
No, I don't wanna see you your face no more, yeah
You used to make me the happiest guy in this world
I thought we made a bargain I thought we made a deal
I thought it was the two of us I thought that's maybe how you'd feel
I thought we'd last forever I thought we had a plan
I thought it was the two of us I thought maybe that you'd understand
You used to make me happy but what'd ya do
