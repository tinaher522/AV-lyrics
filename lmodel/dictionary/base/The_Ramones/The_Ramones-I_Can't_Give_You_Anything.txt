<song artist="The_Ramones" title="I_Can't_Give_You_Anything">
You better know what you want you know how little I got
I can't give you anything I can't give you anything I can't give you anything
You better know what you want you know how little I got
I can't give you anything I can't give you anything I can't give you anything
You think I'm real cute but who's gonna bring home the loot?
Make up your mind about hope you don't doubt, that
I can't give you anything I can't give you anything I can't give you anything
You better know what you want You know how little I got
I can't give you anything I can't give you anything I can't give you anything
You think I'm real cute but who's gonna bring home the loot?
Make up your mind about hope you don't doubt, that
I can't give you anything I can't give you anything I can't give you anything
