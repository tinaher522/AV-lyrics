<song artist="The_Ramones" title="Time_Has_Come_Today">
originally by Chambers Brothers 
Time has come today young hearts can go
Their way can't put it off another day
I don't care what others say they say we
Don't listen anyway time has come today, hey
The room has changed today I have no place to stay
I'm thinking about the subway my love has blown away
My tears have come and gone oh, Lord I got to run
I got no home no, I have no home
Now the time has come nowhere (place) to run
Might get burned up by the sun but I'll have my fun
I've been loved, pushed (put) aside I've been crushed
By tumbling tide and my soul has been psychedelicized
Now the time has come there are things to realize
Time has come today Time has come today
