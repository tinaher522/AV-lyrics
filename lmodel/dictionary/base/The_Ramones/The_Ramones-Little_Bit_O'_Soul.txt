<song artist="The_Ramones" title="Little_Bit_O'_Soul">
Now when you're feelin' low and the fish
Won't bite you need a little bit o'soul
To put you right you gotta make like you
Wanna kneel and pray and then a little 
Bit o'soul will come your way
Now when your girl has gone and you're
Broke in two you need a little bit o'soul
To see you through and when you raise the roof
With your rock and roll you'll get a lot 
More kicks with a little bit o'soul
And if your party falls 'cause there's 
Nobody groovin' a little bit o'soul and
It really starts movin', yeah!
Now when you're in a mess and you feel
Like cryin' just remember this little
Song of mine and as you walk through life
Tryin' to reach your goal remember what
I say 'bout a little bit o'soul
And if your party falls 'cause there's 
Nobody groovin' a little bit o'soul and
It really starts movin', yeah!
A little bit o'soul A little bit o'soul
A little bit o'soul
