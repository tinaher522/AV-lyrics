<song artist="The_Ramones" title="Come_On_Let's_Go">
Well Jessie, doll, darlin', I love you so
Oh I will never never never let you go
Come, darlin', let's go on by by by
Take my by the hand once again, darlin'
Tell me that you love me and you'll never never leave me
That's the way I wanna do, ooo-ee, ooo-ee
Let's go down to the park once again
We'll love each other again and again
Tell me that you'll always love me so
I'll kiss you once, kiss you again
And darling I'll hold your hand
And I'll never never let you go
Come on baby, won't you love me so?
Oh now let's go by back again
Come on little baby, go back in
And I'll never never let your love go; let's go!
Well now you tell me that you love me so
And you'll never let me go
I'll love you, baby, until then
Until death do us part
So come on down, let's go by back again
Come on little baby, go back in
And I'll never never let your love go; let's go!
