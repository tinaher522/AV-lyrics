Oh, oh oh oh, oh ah, a-waa waa waa
Oh, oh oh oh, oh oh, a-waa waa whoa
Sittin' here, with nothin' to do
Sittin' here, thinkin' only of you
But you'll never get out of there
She'll never get out of there
Sittin' here, with nothin' to do
Sittin' here, thinkin' only of you
But you'll never get out of there
She'll never get out of there
I don't care, a-waa waa
Texas Chain Saw Massacre
They took my baby away from me
But you'll never get out of there
She'll never get out of there
Texas Chain Saw Massacre
They took my baby away from me
But you'll never get out of there
She'll never get out of there
I don't care, a-waa waa
When I saw her, on the corner
She told me, told me, told me, told me
She wouldn't go for
Oh, now I know I'm so much in love
'Cause she's the only girl that I'm ever thinkin' of
Texas Chain Saw Massacre
They took my baby away from me
But you'll never get out of there
She'll never get out of there
Texas chain saw massacre
They took my baby away from me
But you'll never get out of there
They tought her up and I don't care
I don't care, a-waa waa
Texas Chain Saw Massacre
Texas Chain Saw Massacre
Oh no, oh yeah
Ohoh no, oh yeah
Ohoh no, oh yeah
Ohoh no, oh yeah
Ohoh no, oh yeah
