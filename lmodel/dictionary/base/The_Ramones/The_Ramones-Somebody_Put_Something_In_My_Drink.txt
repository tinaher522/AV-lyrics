Somebody
Somebody put something in my drink
Somebody
Another night out on the street
Stopping for my usual seat
Oh, bartender, please
Tanqueray n tonic's my favorite drink
I don't like anything colored pink
That just stinks
It's not for me
It feels like
Somebody put something
Somebody put something in my drink
Somebody put something 
Somebody put something 
Blurred vision and dirty thoughts
Feel out of place, very distraught
Feel something coming on
Kick the jukebox, slam the floor
Drink, drink, drink, drink some more
I can't think
Hey! What's in this drink?
It feels like
Somebody put something
Somebody put something in my drink
Somebody put something
Somebody put something in my drink
Somebody put something 
Somebody put something in my drink
Somebody put something
In my drink
In my drink
In my drink
In my drink
So you think it's funny
A college prank
Goin' insane for something to drink
Feel a little dry
Oh, I couldn't care what you think of me
Cause somebody put something in my drink
I can't think
Hey! Give me a drink
It feels like
Somebody put something
Somebody put something in my drink
Somebody put something
Somebody put something in my drink
