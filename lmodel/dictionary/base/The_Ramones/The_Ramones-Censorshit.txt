<song artist="The_Ramones" title="Censorshit">
Tipper, what's that sticker sticking on my CD?
Is that some kind of warning to protect me?
Freedom of choice needs a stronger, stronger voice.
You can stamp out the source, but you 
Can't stop creative thoughts.
Ah, tipper come, ain't you been getting it on?
Ask Ozzie, Zappa or me.
We'll show you what it's like to be free.
Ah, tipper come on, it's just 
a smoke screen for the real problems:
S&amp;L deficit, the homeless, the environment.
Hey, hey all you, all you senators wiwes,
Better take a good look at your own lives
Before you go preaching to me
Your definition of obscenity.

Ah, tipper come on, ain't you been getting it on?
Ask Ozzie, Zappa or me.
We'll show you what it's like to be free.
Ah, tipper come on, it's just
A smoke screen for the real problems:
S&amp;L deficit, the homeless, the environment.
The irony it seems, it seems to me. It's un-american
policy. Yeah, we've come so far but still only to find
people like you with ignorant minds.
Ah, tipper come on, ain't you been getting it on?
Ask Ozzie, Zappa or me.
We'll show you what it's like to be free.
Ah, tipper come on, it's just 
A smoke screen for the real problems:
S&amp;L deficit, the homeless, the environment
