<song artist="The_Ramones" title="The_Job_That_Ate_My_Brain">
Out of the bed at 6:15 In a rush and you can't think
Gotta catch the bus and train I'm in a rush feelin' insane
I can't take this crazy pace I've become a mental case
Yeah, this is the job that ate my brain
Go to work, it's such a drag Face the boss, he's such a nag
In a suit and in a tie I look so lame I wanna die
I can't take this crazy pace I've become a mental case
Yeah, this is the job that ate my brain
I can't take this crazy pace I've become a mental case
Yeah, this is the job that ate my brain
I punch the clock at 9:05 I know I'm late, but still alive
Everyone just stares at me I'm last in line for prosperity
I can't take this crazy pace I've become a mental case
Yeah, this is the job that ate my brain
Five o'clock rolls around I feel so glad I kiss the ground
Ain't enought hours in the day There's go to be a better way
I can't take this crazy pace I've become a mental case
Yeah, this is the job that ate my brain
I can't take this crazy pace I've become a mental case
Yeah, this is the job that ate my brain
