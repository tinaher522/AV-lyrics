<song artist="The_Ramones" title="Do_You_Remember_Rock_'N'_Roll_Radio?">
This is rock 'n' roll radio. Come on, let's rock and roll with the Ramones.
Rock'n, rock 'n' roll radio, let's go
Rock'n, rock 'n' roll radio, let's go
Rock'n, rock 'n' roll radio, let's go
Rock'n, rock 'n' roll radio, let's go
Do you remember Hullabaloo
Upbeat, Shinding and Ed Sullivan too?
Do you remember rock 'n' roll radio?
Do you remember rock 'n' roll radio?
Do you remember Murray the K
Alan Freed and high energy?
It's the end, the end of the seventies
It's the end, the end of the century
Do you remember lying in bed
With the covers pulled up over your head?
Radio playin' so no one can see
We need change and we need it fast
Before rock's just part of the past
'Cause lately it all sounds the same to me
Whoa whoa, oh oh
Rock'n, rock 'n' roll radio, let's go
Rock'n, rock 'n' roll radio, let's go
Rock'n, rock 'n' roll radio, let's go
Rock'n, rock 'n' roll radio, let's go
Will you remember Jerry Lee
John Lennon, T. Rex and OI Moulty?
It's the end, the end of the seventies
It's the end, the end of the century
Do you remember lying in bed
With the covers pulled up over your head?
Radio playin' so no one can see
We need change and we need it fast
Before rock's just part of the past
'Cause lately it all sounds the same to me
Whoa whoa, oh oh
Rock'n, rock 'n' roll radio, let's go
Rock'n, rock 'n' roll radio, let's go
Rock'n, rock 'n' roll radio, let's go
Rock'n, rock 'n' roll radio, let's go
This is rock and roll radio. Stay tuned for more rock and roll.
