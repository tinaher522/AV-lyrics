<song artist="The_Ramones" title="Outsider">
I'm an outsider 
outside of everything
I'm an outsider 
outside of everything
I'm an outsider 
outside of everything
everything you know
everything you know 
it disturbs me so
I'm an outsider 
outside of everything
I'm an outsider 
outside of everything
I'm an outsider 
outside of everything
everything you know
everything you know 
it disturbs me so
Everybody tried to push me
push me around
everybody tried to put me
try to put me down
All messed up, hey everyone
I've already had all my fun
more troubles are gonna come
I've already had all my fun 
ooh yeah, yeah, yeah
Everybody tried to push me
push me around
everybody tried to put me
try to put me down
I'm an outsider 
outside of everything
I'm an outsider 
outside of everything
I'm an outsider 
outside of everything
everything you know
everything you know 
it disturbs me so
