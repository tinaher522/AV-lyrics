<song artist="The_Ramones" title="Today_Your_Love,_Tomorrow_The_World">
I'm a shock trooper in a stupor
Yes I am
I'm a Nazi shatze
You know I fight for Fatherland
I'm a shock trooper in a stupor
Yes I am
I'm a Nazi shatze
You know I fight for Fatherland
Little German boy
Being pushed around
Little German boy
In a German town
I'm a shock trooper in a stooper
Yes I am
I'm a Nazi shatze
You know I fight for Fatherland
I'm a shock trooper in a stupor
Yes I am
I'm a Nazi shatz
You know I fight for Fatherland
Little German boy
Being pushed around
Little German boy
In a German town
Today your love, tomorrow the world
Today your love, tomorrow the world
Today your love, tomorrow the world
Today your love, tomorrow the world
Today your love, tomorrow the world
