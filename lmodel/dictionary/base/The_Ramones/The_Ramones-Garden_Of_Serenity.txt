<song artist="The_Ramones" title="Garden_Of_Serenity">
Come on take my hand
Come on little panther 
These spirits are angry
Stay away from danger
This is insanity
Farewell to the sanity
Farewell my friend
In the Garden of Serenity
In the Garden of Serenity
In the Garden of Serenity
In the Garden of Serenity
Meet me in the graveyard
We'll walk amongst the dead
On a midnight odisy    
Right here in my hand
I'm not your enemy 
Yeah, I am your friend
Come with me on a journey
On a journey to the end
In the Garden of Serenity
In the Garden of Serenity
In the Garden of Serenity
In the Garden of Serenity
