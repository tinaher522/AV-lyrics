<song artist="The_Ramones" title="I'm_Affected">
When I look into your big brown eyes
And i feel like I'm in paradise
I want you by my side
'Cause I'm affected, 'fected
Yeah, I'm affected, 'fected
Well I'm affected
And all I want is you
Didn't know it a few years ago 
But now finally know
I want you by my side
I want you baby, baby, baby, baby
Yeah, I love you and I want you to know
Yeah, yeah, and that's for sure
I want you by my side
'Cause I'm affected, 'fected
Yeah, I'm affected
Well I'm affected
And all I want is you
