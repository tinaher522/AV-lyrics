<song artist="The_Ramones" title="My_Back_Pages">
Crimson flames tied through my ears
Rollin' high and mighty traps pounced with fire on flaming roads
Using ideas as my maps "We'll meet on edges, soon," Said I
Proud 'neath heated brow ah, but I was so much older then,
I'm younger than that now
Half-wracked prejudice leaped forth "Rip down all hate," I screamed
Lies that life is black and white spoke from my skull I dreamed
Romantic facts of musketeers foundation deep, somehow
Ah, but I was so much older then, I'm younger than that now
In a soldier's stance, I aimed my hand at the mongrel dogs who teach
Fearing not that I'd become my enemy in the instant that I preach
My pathway led by confusion boats mutiny from stern to bow
Ah, but I was so much older then, I'm younger than that now
Ah, but I was so much older then, I'm younger than that now
Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats too noble to neglect
Deceived me into thinking I had something to protect
Good and bad, I define these terms quite clear, no doubt, somehow
Ah, but I was so much older then, I'm younger than that now
Ah, but I was so much older then, I'm younger than that now
Ah, but I was so much older then, I'm younger than that now
