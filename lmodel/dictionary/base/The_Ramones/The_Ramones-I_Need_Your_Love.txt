<song artist="The_Ramones" title="I_Need_Your_Love">
Went to my girlfriend's yesterday the
Only thing I wanted to say is little girl
won't you come out and play, yeah
Told that girl surrender to me take your
Love and send it to me come on baby
Can't you see it's you, yeah, tonight
I need your love I need your love
I need your love, tonight
I need your love I need your love
I need your love, tonight
Ah, you took a walk with me and then you
Took a hold of my hand and I knew it was
Going as planned, yeah, baby
I need your love I need your love
I need your love, tonight
