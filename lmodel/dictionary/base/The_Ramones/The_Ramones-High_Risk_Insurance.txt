<song artist="The_Ramones" title="High_Risk_Insurance">
High risk insurance. The time is right.
High risk insurance. The time is right.
Got endurance, I was trained. 
I got my sights adjusted and my telescope aimed.
High risk insurance. The time is right.
High risk insurance. The time is right.
Everybody wants an explanation.
Got no love for the enemy nation.
High risk insurance
High risk insurance
High risk insurance
High risk insurance
High risk insurance. The time is right.
High risk insurance. The time is right.
Everybody wants an explanation.
Got no love for the enemy nation.
You gotta fight to stay independent.
I got my pride and I'm gonna defend it.
Got endurance, I was trained. 
I got my sights adjusted and my telescope aimed.
High risk insurance
High risk insurance
High risk insurance
High risk insurance
