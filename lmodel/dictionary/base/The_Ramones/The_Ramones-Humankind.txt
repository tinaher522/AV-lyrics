<song artist="The_Ramones" title="Humankind">
Humankind, it's not fair, why should we all live in fear
Humankind, it's a test, to see who's the very best
Humankind, don't know why, no one cares who lives or dies
Humankind, don't look at me, look at yourself, what do you see
People - always tellin' lies, they can keep their alibi
People - knockin' at my door, how come they want more and more
People - talkin' behind your back, most of them drive a Gadillac
People - staring at your clothes - I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE, NO MORE
Humankind, it's a shame, some don't even know their name
Humankind are so strange, some need to be rearranged
Humankind, don't know why, no one cares who lives or dies.
Humankind, don't look at me, look at yourself, what do you see
People - always tellin' lies, they can keep their alibi
People - knockin' at my door, how come they want more and more
People - talkin' behind your back, most of them drive a Gadillac
People - staring at your clothes - I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE, NO MORE
Tell me, tell me, who's to blame, for people acting this way
Tell me, tell me, what's so wrong, if humans just got along
Tell me, tell me, tell me please, if psychiatric help is 
what we nedd - (oh)
People - always tellin' lies, they can keep their alibi
People - knockin' at my door, how come they want more and more
People - talkin' behind your back, most of them drive a Gadillac
People - staring at your clothes - I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE, 
People - yeah
People - yeah
