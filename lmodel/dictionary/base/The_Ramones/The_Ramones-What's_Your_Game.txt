<song artist="The_Ramones" title="What's_Your_Game">
I know your name, I know your game
Sweet Mary Jane, you're quite insane
And all you ever want to be is like the other girls you see
And all you ever want to be is like the other girls you see
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
I know your name, I know your game
Sweet Mary Jane, you're quite insane
I know your name, I know your game
Sweet Mary Jane, you're quite insane
And all you ever want to be is like the other girls you see
And all you ever want to be is like the other girls you see
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
