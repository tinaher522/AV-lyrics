<song artist="The_Ramones" title="Go_Mental">
Out of the hospital Out against my will
Life is so beautiful I've gone mental
Mental Mental
I've killed my family They thought I was an oddity
Life is so beautiful I am a vegetable
Mental Mental
I've gone mental I've gone mental
Staring at my goldfish bowl Popping phenobarbitol
Life is so beautiful I've gone mental Mental Mental
Sitting on my window sill Life is so beautiful
I've become irrational I've gone mental
Mental Mental I've gone mental
