<song artist="The_Ramones" title="Highest_Trails_Above">
Sinking into the stars diving in for a swim
Soaring like a superhero past the end of disneyland
Through dragon mist above alpine peaks
To the cloudy lace to the highest trails above
I feel so safe I feel content
Send you all my love
Southern winds, shining rays are all I need
For flight flying way past hero
Paradise is just a sight
Through the distant blue above the highest stars
To the silent dark send you all my love
I feel so safe flying on a ray
On the highest trails above
Sinking into the stars diving in for a swim
Soaring like a superhero past the end of disneyland
Every wish comes true most desired dreams
Happy endings too finally you find love
I feel so safe flying on a ray
On the highest trails above
