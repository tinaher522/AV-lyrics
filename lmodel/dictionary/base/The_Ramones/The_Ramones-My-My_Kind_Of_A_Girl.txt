<song artist="The_Ramones" title="My-My_Kind_Of_A_Girl">
When I saw you on 8th street
You could make my life complete, baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You're my-my kind of a girl
And when I saw you by the Juke Box, ow-ow
You put my quarter in and played my favourite song too, baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You're my-my kind of a girl
I think we'd look pretty good together,
walking through a winter wonderland
And this time I think it's forever
I hope your parents understand
When I saw you by the Peppermint Lounge
You were lost but you've been found, baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You're my-my kind of a girl
