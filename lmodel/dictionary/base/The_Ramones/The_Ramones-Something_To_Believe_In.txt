<song artist="The_Ramones" title="Something_To_Believe_In">
I wish I was someone else
I'm confused I'm afraid I hate the loneliness
And there's nowhere to run to
Nothing makes any sense
But I still try my hardest
Take my hand
Please help me man
'Coz I'm looking for something to believe in
And I don't know where to start
And I dont' know where to begin, to begin
If I was stupid or naive
Trying to achieve what they all call contentness
If people weren't such dicks
And I never made mistakes
Then I could find forgiveness
Take my hand
Please help me man
'Coz I'm looking for something to believe in
And I don't know where to start
And I dont' know where to begin
Oh No
I can't be someone else
I don't feel that it's hopeless
I don't feel that I'm useless
I can't throw it all away
I need some courage to find my weakness
And with your love
I know with all my heart I can win
'Coz I'm looking for something to believe in
And I just need something to believe in...
