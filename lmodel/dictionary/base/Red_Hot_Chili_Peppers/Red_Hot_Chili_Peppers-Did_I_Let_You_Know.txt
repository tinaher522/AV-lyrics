<song artist="Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers" title="Did_I_Let_You_Know">
I'm coming for ya 'cause
'Cause I adore ya and
I like to get inside your mass production
This indecision has
Has got me cringing, well
I can't resist the smell of your seduction
Did I let you know?
Would you like to go?
Unwrap the package without much persuasion
Did I let you know?
Would you like to go?
I wanna dance to everyday's occasion
This I know! Yeah, this I know!
(Take me home, well take me home)
This I know, we're not alone
(Take me home, take me home)
When we envision a lack of division and
The planet does another revolution
The day I blew on ya
You said I grew on ya
Turns out that we are all the one solution, go!
I'm coming at you, well
You are the cat too and
I like the sound of your articulations
Want to arouse her and
Maybe espouse her, well
She showed me love without the stipulations
This I know! Yeah, this I know!
(Take me home, well take me home)
This I know, we're not alone
(Take me home, take me home)
I wanna lean on ya
Get Jan and Dean on ya
It's time to sway a little mass perception
I like you cheeky, well
So Mozambique-y and
I think the world could use a clear connection
This I know! Yeah, this I know!
(Take me home, well take me home)
This I know, we're not alone
(Take me home, take me home)
This I know! Hey, this I know!
(Take me home, well take me home)
This I know, we're not alone
(Take me home, take me home)
Did I let you know?
Would you like to go?
Did I let you know?
Would you like to go?
Did I let you know?
Would you like to go?
