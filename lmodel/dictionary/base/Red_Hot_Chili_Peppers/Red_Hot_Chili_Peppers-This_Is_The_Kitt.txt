<song artist="Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers" title="This_Is_The_Kitt">
This is the kitt, I can't compare
A delicate new arrival
Check the commute I do declare
Lets sing a new revival
Chemical circus at the pub
Mentally she’s departed
Cut me a check I’ll cut your rug
Later we’ll get bombarded
‘Cause everybody knows
The game is full of highs and lows
Like your mother said
Girl your father is dead
Everybody knows
That life is full of highs and lows
Is there always red
In your wedding bed
Everybody knows
Officer please I just got there
Traveled from door to door
Haven’t you seen my girlfriend’s hair
What are we looking for
‘Cause everybody knows
The game is full of highs and lows
Like your mother said
Girl your father is dead
Everybody knows
That life is full of highs and lows
Is there always red
In your wedding bed
Everybody knows
This is the kitt I can’t compare
A delicate new arrival
Check the commute I do declare
I think we have our bible
‘Cause everybody knows
The game is full of highs and lows
Like your mother said
Girl your father is dead
Everybody knows
That life is full of highs and lows
Is there always red
In your wedding bed
Take me to the shore
Show me what it’s for
Is there always red
In your wedding bed
Everybody knows
The game is full of cons and pros
Like your mother said
Girl your father's dead
Everybody knows
