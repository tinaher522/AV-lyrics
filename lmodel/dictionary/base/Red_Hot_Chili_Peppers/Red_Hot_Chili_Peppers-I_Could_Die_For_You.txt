<song artist="Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers" title="I_Could_Die_For_You">
Something inside the cards I know is right
Don't wanna live somebody else's life
This is what I want to be
And this is what I give to you because I get it free
She smiles while I do my time
I could die for you
Oh this life I choose
I'm here to be your only go-between
To tell you of the sights these eyes have seen
What I really want to do, is turn it into motion, beauty that I can't abuse
You know that I use my senses to
You can see that it's only everywhere
I'd take it all and then I'd find a way to share
Come along and go, alone with me
Wander with me yo, it's all for free
I could die for you
What you wanna do
Oh this life I choose
I could die for you
What you wanna do
Oh this life I choose
Come again and tell me where you wanna go
What it means for me to be with you alone
Close the door and no one has to know
How we are
Come along and go, alone with me
Wander with me yo, it's all for free
I could die for you
What you wanna do
Oh this life I choose
I could die for you
What you wanna do
Oh this life I choose
Make me wanna say
I could die for you
What you wanna do
Oh this life I choose
I could die for you
What you wanna do
Oh this life I choose
