<song artist="Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers" title="Blackeyed_Blonde">
Pumping the blood through the heart of New Orleans
She's the mystic heat of the Bourbon street dream
She's just made out of flesh and bones
But let me tell you little boy, you better leave her alone
Leroy Brown thought he was bad too
Till she left him floating in the old bayou
She's the kind of girl, she's built like a bomb
She's the black-eyed, black-eyed, black-eyed blonde, get down
That black-eyed beauty with the golden crotch
French electric sex-a-cock shocking swamp fox
Heaten queen of sleaze, she's hot to box
But let me tell you little boy, she'll clean your clock
A slick and sly spy, stuck in the muck of the moat
Blew his mind to find a diamond in the boat
Double-o-dooms day for Mr James Bond
She's the black-eyed, black-eyed, black-eyed blonde, get down
