<song artist="Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers" title="Love_Of_Your_Life">
Sat on a cliff
Wondering what did I miss
I watch the waves come in
Roll in, roll out
Without a single doubt
Love on a bluff
Is there ever enough
I stare into the air
Somewhere out there
The family affair
Bring home the night
Hey, I know that you turned on the light
Hey, so slow but you gave me
The love of my life
Coming up short
And I’m sad to report
We fuss and fight tonight
Your case, my case
Another day to waste
Lovers don’t mix
When they can’t even fix
A plot that has a twist
To share, my prayer
I need my baby bear
Come home tonight
Hey, I know that you turned on the light
Hey, so slow but you gave me
The love of my life
The love of my life
The love of my life
Hey hey hey, I know
That I waited so long
Hey hey hey, so slow
But you gave me the love of my life
...Oh she gave me the love of my life
Tell her Flea, go ahead
