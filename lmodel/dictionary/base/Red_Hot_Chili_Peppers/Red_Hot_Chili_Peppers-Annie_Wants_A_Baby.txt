Lucy Rebar
She's a friend of mine
Later she'll go
Back and redefine the line
It's getting longer all the time
Oh yeah
Drinkin' sunshine
She likes the taste of it
She had a gold mine
But then she wasted it away
You should have seen her yesterday
Oh yeah
Send along the way
Nothing stops the ache
Sugar daddy
Loves her madly
Cosma Shiva
Got off
Made you a believer
I don't need to
Tender
Why do I believe you?
Annie wants a baby now
Annie wants a baby any way she can
Missing pieces
She's got a lot of 'em
Time decreases
I wish I thought of 'em before
Before it's time
To close the store
Oh yeah
Distillation
A lonely sycophant
Some liberation
The only seed
We ever plant
I wanna help you
But I can't
No, no
Send along the way
Nothing stops the ache
Sugar daddy
Loves her madly
Love 'er, leave 'er
God off
Made you a believer
Neon soldiers
Left her
Now you've gotten older
Annie wants a baby now
Annie wants a baby any way she can
It's getting longer all the time
It's time to redesign the sign
Oh yeah
Sings along the way
