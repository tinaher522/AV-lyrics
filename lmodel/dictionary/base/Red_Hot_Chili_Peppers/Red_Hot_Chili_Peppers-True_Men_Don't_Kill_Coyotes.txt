Hoo, Lord!
Well, I'm gonna ride a sabertooth horse
Through the Hollywood hills
The farther west, the farther out
Yeah, that's the way I feel
Well, I dig the dirt an' I dig the dust
I barbecue my meals
Ridin' wild on a paisley dragon
Through the Hollywood hills, yeah...
Huh, Hollywood hills
Well, I'm gonna ride a sabertooth horse
Through the Hollywood hills
Just don't show me anything
'cos that's the way I feel
Well, I dig the dirt an' I dig the dust
I barbecue my meals
Ridin' wild on a paisley dragon
Through the Hollywood hills, yeah...
Huh, Hollywood hills
Passion dripping from the coyote's eyes
He can taste his blood
An' blood never lies
Pale face die
True men don't kill coyotes
True men don't kill coyotes
Well, I'm gonna ride a sabertooth horse
Through the Hollywood hills
The farther west, the farther out
Yeah, that's the way I feel
Well, I dig the dirt an' I dig the dust
I barbecue my meals
Ridin' wild on a paisley dragon
Through the Hollywood hills, yeah...
Huh, Hollywood hills
Passion dripping from the coyote's eyes
He can taste his blood
An' blood never lies
Pale face die
True men don't kill coyotes
True men don't...
Well, I'm gonna ride a sabertooth horse
Through the Hollywood hills
Just don't tell me anything
'cos that's the way I feel
Well, I dig the dirt an' I dig the dust
I barbecue my meals
Ridin' wild on a paisley dragon
Through the Hollywood hills, yeah...
Huh, Hollywood hills
Passion dripping from the coyote's eyes
He can taste his blood
An' blood never lies
Pale face die
True men don't kill coyotes
True men don't...
True men don't kill coyotes
True men don't...
True men don't kill coyotes
True men don't...
