"Oh good god in heaven almighty, heavens to Murgatroyd, we've got a cataclysmic situation developing, somebody get down here now...!"
Come on come on baby
Let me show you what I'm talkin' about
Whoop-tay-Whoop-tay-git-ta-gala-goop-ta
You try to be a lady
But you're walkin' like a sauerkraut
Whoop-tay-Whoop-tay-git-ta-gala-goop-ta
Looka looka lika lika
Like you want to get some
Whoop-tay-Whoop-tay-git-ta-gala-goop-ta
If you never tell a lie
Then you never have to play dumb
Whoop-tay-Whoop-tay-git-ta-gala-goop-ta
Dirty baby, time you're gonna take some
Pretty baby, love you're gonna make some
Little lady, hearts you're gonna break some
Kinda shady, tears you're gonna fake some
Dirty baby, we've got a situation
Pretty baby, open invitation
Little lady, what a reputation
Kinda shady, now you're gonna make again
I know you can straddle the atmosphere
A tiny storm in your teacup, girl
I know you can battle the masses, dear
A tiny storm in your teacup, girl
"Oh god, oh no, oh no it's getting worse, worse by the minute, uh-uh-uh we're down here at division and 5th street, somebody send for back up right now!"
Every other day you say
You're gonna have to bury 'em
Whoop-tay-Whoop-tay-git-ta-gala-goop-ta
Famous last words
Spoken from the laserium
Whoop-tay-Whoop-tay-git-ta-gala-goop-ta
Descendents had a record
Sayin' somethin' 'bout Milo
Whoop-tay-Whoop-tay-git-ta-gala-goop-ta
You can take the A-Train
But you're gonna have to lie low
Whoop-tay-Whoop-tay-git-ta-gala-goop-ta
I know you can straddle the atmosphere
A tiny storm in your teacup, girl
I know you can battle the masses, dear
A tiny storm in your teacup, girl
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Dirty baby, time you're gonna take some
Pretty baby, love you're gonna make some
Little lady, hearts you're gonna break some
Kinda shady, tears you're gonna fake some
Dirty baby, we've got a situation
Pretty baby, open invitation
Little lady, what a reputation
Kinda shady, now you're gonna make again
I know you can straddle the atmosphere
A tiny storm in your teacup, girl
I know we may never get out of here
A tiny storm in your teacup, girl
