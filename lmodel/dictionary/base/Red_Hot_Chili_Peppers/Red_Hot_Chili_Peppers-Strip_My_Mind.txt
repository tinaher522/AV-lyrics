<song artist="Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers" title="Strip_My_Mind">
Oh, yeah, yeah, woah, yeah
Arthur J did indicate
The boulevard would never be
So full of love and life again (ay)
Hot as Hades early eighties
Sing another song and make me
Feel like I'm in love again (ay)
Oh, yeah
Oh, please don't strip my mind
Leave something behind
Please don't strip my mind
Oh, yeah, yeah, woah, yeah
All in favor, sign the waiver
Bloody Carolina won't you
Take another look inside (ay)
Operator, co-creator
Come on radiator won't you
Blow another top and sing (ay)
Oh yeah
Oh, please don't strip my mind
Leave something behind
Please don't strip my mind
El Dorado won the lotto
All that cash and not a clue
But now you know what I've been through (ay)
Oh yeah
Oh, please don't strip my mind
Leave something behind
Please don't strip my mind
