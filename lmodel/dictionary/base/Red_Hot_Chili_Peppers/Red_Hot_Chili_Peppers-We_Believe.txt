<song artist="Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers" title="We_Believe">
The curtain is open
A head to put dope in
Now we will come clean it
The future, we've seen it
No, no, I know, I said, no no
It's like a dream that falls away
Into the night where we can play
I'm on a train, one happy day
Two eyes for sight, three times I pray
Soda pop, we've got to set up shop
And when the weather comes
We've got a pressure drop
We don't know
But everyday I go
To see what I can bring
Into a cameo
Oh oh oh no
We believe, We believe
We believe, We believe
(Climb a tree for monkey business
Write a check out to forgiveness
All the world on half an acre
Pushing dirt into a quaker)
The mission, the method
The downfall arrested
Cuz it's not the first time
Nor is it the worst time
No no oh no
To see the bird without a care
For in a word, it's nice out there
In a tree, my mama bear
Will be all right with proper care
Hey hey hey do
Boomerang into a bigger bang
A little cry of love, because they cannot sing
Cherokee, what did the pharaoh see?
Another time and space, another place to be
We believe, We believe
We believe, We believe
We believe, We believe
We believe, We believe
(Climb a tree for monkey business
Write a check out to forgiveness
All the world on half an acre
Pushing dirt into a quaker)
The motive, the measure
The purpose, the pleasure
The risk is it worth it
The disc is it perfect
I found you amongst them
The flower with young stem
Disparage the broken
The marriage elopin'
