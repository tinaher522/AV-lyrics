<song artist="Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers" title="Stone_Cold_Bush">
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
She's stone cold bush, yeah
And baby that's alright
She's stone cold bush, yeah
And that's alright with me
Get up off your knees, come on walk with me
Tell me what you need to get along
A statue come to life, I cut you with my knife
Bleeding to the tune of dolly dagger
She's stone cold bush
She's stone cold bush
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Haight Street, got nothing to show
Except the skirt on your ass
When you're living on the streets you've got to let it roll
Get on with what you've got
Aw, everybody knows that it's alright
You've got no secrets to tell
But when you smoke that rock and suck that cock
You do it, oh, so well
She's stone cold bush
She's stone cold bush
She's stone cold bush, yeah
And baby that's alright
She's stone cold bush, yeah
And that's alright with me
She's got marble eyes, sweet china doll, her thighs
An animal in pain, she starts to cry
Her pipes are open wide, she blows more than my mind
Echo the sounds of soul, time after time
She's stone cold bush
She's stone cold bush
