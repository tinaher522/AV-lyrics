Smile
When I'm shy in ways
But I love
Everything of first impressions
Sweet successions
Been around for quite a while
I see you kept it versatile
Motivated to combine
Even when it's bad it's fine
Did she say something
That made you cry?
Have you lost it all?
The big fall
Oh so slowly
Comes back holy
Bishop takes a knight
But I will put up quite a fight
Here is your ham on rye
Elementary the chemistry
Means everything to me
The long progression’s why
Set it off to collect knowledge
Quit a job
And go to college
All about the aftershock
Swedish Latin super funk
Moses of Manhattan
Made it great
Pain we celebrate
And I love
The long progression indiscretion
Bishop takes a knight
But I will put up quite a fight
Here's your ham on rye
Elementary the chemistry means everything to me
The long progression's why
In between the reasons
Are the psychedelic seasons
Simple as your stride
Information intimated
Elegant and integrated
Sweet your floors with pride
Smile
'Cause it's all a ride
All supplied
And I love
Everything about this session
And this long progression
Bishop takes a knight
But I will put up quite a fight
Here is your ham on rye
Elementary the chemistry
Means everything to me
Long progression’s why
In between the reasons
Are the psychedelic seasons
Simple as your stride
Elementary the chemistry means everything to me
Long progression's why
