(Gonna get ya, gonna shake ya) Whoo!
(Gonna get ya, gonna shake ya)
(Gonna get ya, gonna shake ya)
(Gonna get ya, gonna shake ya)
40 detectives this week
40 detectives strong
Taking a stroll down Love Street
Strolling - Is that so wrong? Can I get my co-defendant?
Hump de bump doop bodu
Bump de hump doop bop
Hump de bump doop bodu
(Oh no)
Bump de hump doop bodu
Hump de bump doop bop
Bump de hump doop bodu
Bump bump
Whoo!
There must have been a hundred miles
Or any of a hundred styles
It's not about the smile you wear but
The way we make out
When I was an all-aloner
Nothing but a two beach comber 
Anybody seen the sky?
I'm wide awake now
Working the beat as we speak
Working the belle du monde
Believe in the havoc we wreak
Believing - Is that so wrong? Can I get my co-dependent?
Hump de bump doop bodu
Bump de hump doop bop
Hump de bump doop bodu
Bump de hump doop bodu
Hump de bump doop bop
Bump de hump doop bodu
Bump bump
Come on!
Must have been a hundred miles
Any of a hundred styles
It's not about the smile you wear but
The way we make out
When I was an all-aloner
Nothing but a two beach comber 
Anybody seen the sky?
I'm wide awake now
(Gonna get ya, gonna shake ya)
(Gonna get ya, gonna shake ya)
(Gonna get ya, gonna shake ya)
(Gonna get ya, gonna shake ya)
(Gonna get ya, gonna shake ya)
(Gonna get ya, gonna shake ya)
(Gonna get ya, gonna shake ya)
(Gonna get ya)
Hump de bump doop bodu
Bump de hump doop bop
Hump de bump doop bodu
(Oh no)
Bump de hump doop bodu
Hump de bump doop bop
Bump de hump doop bodu
Bump bump
Listen to me what I said
And try to get it through your head
A little bit of circumstance and
A chance to make out
Living in a citadel
It's hard enough to be yourself
Waiting for the bell to toll and
I'm wide awake now
There must have been a hundred miles
Or any of a hundred styles
It's not about the smile you wear but
The way we make out
When I was an all-aloner
Nothing but a two beach comber 
Anybody seen the sky?
I'm wide awake now
