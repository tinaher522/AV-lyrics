Shiver for me, girl
Deliver for me, my darling
Pushing up to you
A river that runs right through you
Swim for your smile in a blue rock quarry
Make it for me, baby, you won't be sorry
Shiver for me now
Deliver for me, my darling
Miles and miles of nether worlds I roam
Settle for love, you're never far from home
Carry me down into the waters of
Carry me down into the water of love
Two of us were made of angel dust
I've been around, but not around enough
Shadow my free form
A woman that I could keep warm
Quiver for me, girl
Give me your head and shoulders
Shot from the pages of love and glory
Sleeping next to you, and I'm in your story
Shadow my free form
A woman that I could keep warm
Miles and miles of nether worlds I roam
Settle for love, you're never far from home
Carry me down into the waters of
Carry me down into the water of love
Two of us were made of angel dust
I've been around, but not around enough
Let's go, I know I'll make it for two
And then intuition's only what you take from it
I know, I'll make it for two
And then you were there and I was fortunate
I know, I'll make it for two
And then a messy bed, apology that I will fall for you, yeah
I know, I'll make it for two
I'll make it for two, I'll make it for two and
Shiver for me now
Deliver for me, my darling
A living that I could
Be given to you, my sweet love
Swim for your smile in a blue rock quarry
Make it for me, baby, you won't be sorry
Shot from the pages of love and glory
Sleeping next to you and I'm in your dream
Settle for love
Settle for love
Settle for love
