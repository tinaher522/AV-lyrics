<song artist="Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers" title="My_Lovely_Man">
I used to shout across the room to you
And you'd come dancing like a fool
Shuffle step, you funky mother
Come to me, all warm as covers
Rest with me, my lovely brother
For you see, there is no other
Memory, so sad and sweet
I'll see you soon, save me a seat
Oh well, I'm crying
Oh now, my lovely man
Oh yes, I'm crying
Oh now, and no one can
Well, ever fill the
The hole you left, my man
I'll see you later
My lovely man, if I can
In my room, I'm all alone
Waiting for you to get home
I listen to Roberta Flack
But I know you won't come back
Oh well, I'm crying
Oh now, my lovely man
I'll see you later
My lovely man, if I can
Just in case you never knew
I miss you Slim, I love you too
Oh, see my heart, it's black and blue
When I die, I will find you
Oh well, I'm crying
Oh now, my lovely man
Oh yes, I'm crying
Oh now, and no one can
Well, ever fill the
The hole you left, my man
I'll see you later
My lovely man, if I can
Well, I'm crying
My lovely man, yeah
Well, I'm crying, yeah
They all know, yeah
Oh, I miss you, been down
My lovely man
I'll see you later
My lovely man
We have some good time
My lovely man
Yeah
