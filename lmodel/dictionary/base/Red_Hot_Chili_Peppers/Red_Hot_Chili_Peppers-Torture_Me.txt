<song artist="Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers" title="Torture_Me">
Because I'm happy to be sad
I want it all I want it bad
Oh, it's what I know
A vintage year for pop, I hear
The middle of the end is near
Let's go, oh, it's what I know
Torture me and torture me
Forcin' me so torture me, please
Torture me with sorcery
Forcin' me so torture me, please
All the leaves are turning brown
The wind is pushing me around
Let's go, it's what I know
Torture me and torture me
It's forcin' me so torture me, please
Torture me with sorcery
Forcin' me so torture me, please
The will of God is standing still
Brazilian children get their fill
Let's go
Let's turn it up and dumb it down
The vision of your ultra sound
Is so
And all the leaves are turning brown
The wind is pushing me around
Let's go 
A vintage year for pop I hear
The middle of the end is near
It's so
Torture me and torture me
It's forcin' me so torture me, please
Torture me with sorcery
Forcin' me so torture me, please
Torture me and torture me
It's forcin' me and so torture me, please
Torture me with sorcery
Forcin' me so torture me, please.
