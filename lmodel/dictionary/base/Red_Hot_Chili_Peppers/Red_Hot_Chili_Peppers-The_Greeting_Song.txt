<song artist="Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers" title="The_Greeting_Song">
Driving around, I've got my baby and my top down
Mary-go-round, I ride you for my love
Throwing me down in the backseat underground
I'm on the mound, I make it for my love
Making my way, I brake another L.A. day
Time in the town, I need it for my love
My Chevrolet, you're rolling to another play day
This is the sound, I listen for my love
Who you talking to?
Talk to me, you
Sound of music
Who you talking to?
Talk to me, you
Sound of music
I love you
Swim through me
Good feelings
Come to me
Sought and I found, a life of making my blood sound
Do anything for the one I love
Something profound, the face of God is in Sensurround
I'm on the mound, I make it for my love
Who you talking to?
Talk to me, you
Sound of music
Who you talking to?
Talk to me, you
Sound of music
I love you
Swim through me
Good feelings
Come to me
I love you
Swim through me
Good feelings
Come to me
I love you
Swim through me
Good feelings
Come to me
