<song artist="Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers" title="Sick_Love">
Say goodbye to Oz and everything you own
California dreamin' is a Pettibon
LA's screaming "you're my home"
Vanity is blasted but it's rarely fair
I could smell the Prozac in your pretty hair
Got a lot of friends, but is anyone there
I don't know but it's been said
Your heart is stronger than your head
And this location is my home
Stick 'n move, you're living in a quick world
Got a heavy laugh for such a tiny girl
Born into it, that's for sure
Rivers get connected so much stronger than expected
Well, sick love comes to wash us away
Prisons of perspective, how your vision gets corrected
And sick love is my modern cliche
People talk and tell you what you want to hear
Do you really need another souvenir?
Superheroes tend to disappear
Fame is just a trick, you see an empty glass
Leave you feeling thirsty and so very fast
Chase your tail my baby, it'll be your last
I don't know but it's been said
Your heart is stronger than your head
And this location is my home
Rivers get connected so much stronger than expected
Well, sick love comes to wash us away
Prisons of perspective, how your vision gets corrected
And sick love is my modern cliche
Rivers get connected so much stronger than expected
Well, sick love comes to wash us away
Prisons of perspective, how your vision gets corrected
And sick love is my modern cliche
Openly defective is the lover you elected
And a portrait she was bound to portray
