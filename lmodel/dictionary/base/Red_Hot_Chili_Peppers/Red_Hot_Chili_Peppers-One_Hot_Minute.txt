<song artist="Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers" title="One_Hot_Minute">
I was riding
Riding on my bike
Me with my friend
We're so alike
Am I all alone
She said all we
Have is this
We just had to stop
And share a kiss
Am I all alone
One hot minute(3x)
And I'm in it come and get it(3x)
If I chase it
I might waste it
come and get it
Am I all alone
Sitting in the fire
get along and have some fun
floating to be higher
maybe I'm your special one
silent testifier
breathe the moon
and eat the sun
sitting in the fire
Close your eyes
And click your heels
Can you believe
How good it feels
Am I all alone
One hot minute(x3)
And I'm in it come and get it
If a chase it I might waste it
Come and get it
I might waste it
Come and get it
Am I all alone
Sitting in the fire
Get along and have some fun
Floating to be higher
Maybe I'm your special one
Silent testifier
Breathe the moon
And eat the sun
Sitting in the fire
A tiny wink is all
All we have
No it's not much more
But don't get mad
Am I all alone
Three lbs. of love
Inside my skull
A million more lives
It's never drill
Just a few times spun
Spun around the sun
A couple more or less
And then we're done
