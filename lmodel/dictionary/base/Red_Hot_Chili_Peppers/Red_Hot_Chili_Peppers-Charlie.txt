<song artist="Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers" title="Charlie">
All aboard... stitch in time
Get yours... got mine
In a minute... I'll be there
Sit tight... get square
You can do it at the hippodrome
Slide back, trombone
Anybody got a TV tome?
That's right, unknown
When I pick up on that smell
Pick it up and run like hell
Little woman save me some
Better get up on your run
So much more than Charlie's wakin' me
To my core and Charlie's shakin' me
Tell my story and Charlie's making me
And Charlie's making me smile
Everybody... do the twist
Get the the message... on Flea's fist
Move around like a scientist
Lay down... get kissed
Big picture and it never lies
Big daddy will advise
Eveready in disguise
Sunset... sunrise
When I pick up on that smell
Pick it up and run like hell
Little woman save me some
Better get up on your run
So much more than Charlie's wakin' me
To my core and Charlie's shakin' me
Tell my story and Charlie's making me
And Charlie's making me smile
My heart, your skin, this love I'm in
We don't arrive without a suprise
You're right, I'm wrong, be free, belong
Intimate sight has come in to light
When I pick up on that smell
Pick it up and run like hell
Little woman save me some
Better get up on your run
All I ever wanted to
Was pick it up and run with you
Slip it into a summer spell
Double up and run like hell, ooh
So much more than Charlie's wakin' me
To my core and Charlie's shakin' me
Tell my story and Charlie's making me
And Charlie's making me smile, woah now
My heart, your skin, this love I'm in
We don't arrive without a suprise
You're right, I'm wrong, be free, belong
Intimate sight has come in to light
My heart, your skin, this love I'm in
We don't arrive without a suprise
You're right, I'm wrong, be free, belong
Intimate sight has come in to light
