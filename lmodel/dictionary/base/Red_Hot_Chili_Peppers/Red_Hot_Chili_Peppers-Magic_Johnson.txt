<song artist="Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers" title="Magic_Johnson">
L.A. Lakers, fast break makers
Kings of the court, shake and bake all takers
Back to back is a bad ass fact
A claim that remains intact
M-A-G-I-C 
See you on the court
Buck has come to play his way and his way is to thwart
M-A-G-I-C 
Magic of the Buck
Other teams pray for dreams
But he don't give a fuck
Penetrating the lane like a bullet train
Comes the magic blood, a telepathic brain
Knucklehead suckers better duck
When the Buck comes through like a truck
Scott stops, pops and drops it in
On his way back, gets a little skin
From the hand of a man named A.C. Green
Slam so hard, break your TV screen
Worthy's hot with his tomahawk
Take it to the hole, make your mamma talk
I hate to burst your bubble but triple double trouble
Is coming to your town and he's going to make rubble
L.A. Lakers, fast break makers
Kings of the court, shake and bake all takers
Back to back is a bad ass fact
A claim that remains intact
M-A-G-I-C
I see you in purple and gold
You can swim, but you won't get far, so you might as well go home
M-A-G-I-C 
In Buck we trust
Restoring order to the court and justice is a must
Lakers are the team that I watch on the telly
'Cause they've got more moves
Than a bowl of jelly
The Buck stops here - pops - then cheers
A roar through the forum
That deafens my ears
The one and only know of his kind
Sits in a throne
Not for the records that he holds
But for being bald and bold
Kareem Abdul Jabbar
All time great super superstar
I hate to burst your bubble
But triple double trouble
Is coming to your town
And he's gonna make rubble
Does anybody want some Magic Johnson?
Does anybody want some Magic Johnson?
Does anybody want some Magic Johnson?
Does anybody want some Magic Johnson?
L.A. Lakers, fast break makers
Kings of the court, shake and bake all takers
Back to back is a bad ass fact
A claim that remains intact
