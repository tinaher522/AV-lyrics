<song artist="Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers" title="Transcending">
You are my god you are my dog
You kept me close love never lost
I called you hippie you said fuck off
Said your brother's a real punk rocker
Something gonna happen
Something very soon
Transcending flesh could be a breeze
Sending me oh over the Moon
Friends near death you gave respect
Sympathetic Intellect
Choices are, for one and all
All we are is, leaves that fall
That's all
Always be loving you
Now I'm away from you
Always be loving you
Round and round inside your head
Smartest fucker I ever met
Vicious fish bit at your toes
Made you lie and numb your soul
Something gonna happen
Something very soon
Transcending flesh could be a breeze
Sending me oh over the Moon
Mule donkey ass you bore the load
Of all creation's tortured souls
Choices are for one and all
All we are are leaves that fall
I like no other, I love you you're my brother
I like no other, I love you you're my brother
I like no other, I love you you're my brother
I like no other, I love you you're my brother
I like no other, I love you you're my brother
I like no other, I love you you're my brother
Water flowing and I will drink it
I will drink for you
A part of me left that only you knew
Will never be understood
Will never be understood
Hey gone to stay
Entire lifetime flash before me
In a loving stream
Hey mother may I have lost a child
But she gave birth
To a loving stream
Ooh, never know
When the gods will come and
Take you
To a loving stream
Ooh, heart of gold
The most special things you gave me were
From your loving stream
In a loving stream
Fuck the magazines
Fuck the green machine
See the human being
In a loving stream
Fuck the legal greed
Fuck the nothing scene
See the family
In a loving stream
