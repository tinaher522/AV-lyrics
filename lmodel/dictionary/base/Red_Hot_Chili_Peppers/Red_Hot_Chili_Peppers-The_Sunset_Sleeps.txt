<song artist="Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers" title="The_Sunset_Sleeps">
Floozies at the rainbow
Superstars that wont get far
Who is who that we know
Coochie Coo is at the bar
Do you really love
Do you love do you love
Do you want to make the call
We all long, we all fall
Shoelace for the sirens
Groupies and the tyrants ply
Do you really want
Do you want do you want
Do you want to have it all
We all long we all fall
I’m so tired
Well I get by
But I could use a few
I’m so tired
That I slept
Along the way
A suitcase of perception
Rhinestones and redemption cries
Do you really love
Do you love do you love
Do you want to make the call
We all long, we all fall
I’m so tired
The sun beats down
Upon my lonely face
I’m so tired
That I slept
Along the way
Do you really love
Do you love do you chase
Do you take this town today
We all long, we all face
I’m so tired
Well I get by
But I could use a few
And I’m so tired
That I slept
Along the way
The sun beats down
Upon my lonely face
A perfect world
With all it’s perfect places
I could use a few
For just in cases
I’m so tired
That I slept
Along the way
