Hot tamales and they red hot
Yes, she got 'em for sale
Hot tamales and they red not
Yes, she got 'em for sale
I got a girl, say she long and tall
She sleeps in the kitchen
With her feets in the hall
Hot tamales and they red hot
Yes, she got 'em for sale, I mean
Yes she got 'em for sale, yeah
Hot tamales and they red hot
Yes, she got 'em for sale 
They're too hot, boy
Hot tamales and they red hot
Yes, now, she got 'em for sale
You know the monkey, now
The baboon playing in the grass
Well, the monkey stuck his finger
In that old Good Gulf Gas, now
Hot tamales and they red hot
Yes, she got 'em for sale, I mean
Yes, she got 'em for sale
Hot tamales and they red hot
Yes, she got 'em for sale
Hot tamales and they red hot
Yes, she got 'em for sale
She got two for a nickel
Got four for a dime
Would sell you more
But they ain't none of mine
Hot tamales and they red hot
Yes, she got 'em for sale, I mean
Yes, she got 'em for sale, yes, yeah
Hot tamales and they red hot
Yes, she got 'em for sale
I'm gonna upset your backbone
Put your kidneys to sleep
I'll due to break away your liver
And dare your heart to beat 'bout my
Hot tamales 'cause they red hot
Yes, they got 'em for sale, I mean
Yes, she got 'em for sale, yeah
