<song artist="Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers" title="Dark_Necessities">
Coming on to the light of day
We got many moons that are deep at play
So I keep an eye on the shadow smile
To see what it has to say
You and I both know
Everything must go away
What do you say
Spinning Knot that is on my heart
Is like a bit of light in a touch of dark
You got sneak attack from the zodiac
But I see your fire spark
Eat the breeze and go
Blow by blow and go away
What do you say
You don't know my mind
You don't know my kind
Dark necessities are part of my design
Tell the world that I'm
Falling from the sky
Dark necessities are part of my design
Stumble down to the parking lot
You got no time for the afterthought
They're like Ice Cream for an Astronaut
Well that's me looking for we
Turn the corner and
Find the world at your command
Playing the hand
You don't know my mind
You don't know my kind
Dark necessities are part of my design
Tell the world that I'm
Falling from the sky
Dark necessities are part of my design
Do you want this love of mine
Darkness helps us all to shine
Do you want it, do you want it now
Do you want it all the time
But darkness helps us all to shine
Do you want it, do you want it now
Pick you up like a paper back
With the track record of a maniac
So I move it in and we unpack
It's the same as yesterday
Any way we roll
Everything must go away
What do you say
You don't know my mind
You don't know my kind
Dark necessities are part of my design
Tell the world that I'm
Falling from the sky and
Dark necessities are part of my design
