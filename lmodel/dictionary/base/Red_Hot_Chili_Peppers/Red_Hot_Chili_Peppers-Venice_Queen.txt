<song artist="Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers" title="Venice_Queen">
Does it go from east to west, ya?
Body free and a body less, ya
Come again just to start a-fresh and 
Once again to find a home 
In the moment of the meantime 
Dropping in, coming through the mesh, ya
Checking in just to get it blessed, ya
Hard to leave when it's picturesque 
Find a form that's free to roam
(Ahh) Where you come from?
(Ahh) Where you going?
(Ahh) Where you come from?
(Ahh) Where you going?
Do it all then it all again, ya
Make it up and you make a friend, ya
Paddle on, just around the bend and
Find a place where you can see
All the mamas and the papas 
Take a chance on a 'recommend', ya
Hard as hell just to comprehend, ya
Disbelief that I do suspend and
Easy now to find a breeze 
(Ahh) Where you come from?
(Ahh) Where you going?
(Ahh) Where you come from?
(Ahh) Where you going?
We all want to tell her 
Tell her that we love her 
Venice gets a queen 
Best I've ever seen
We all want to kiss her 
Tell her that we miss her 
Venice gets a queen 
Best I've ever...
I know you said you don't believe 
In God, do you still disagree?
Now that it's time for you to leave 
G.L.O.R.I.A. is love
My friend
My friend
My friend
(Ooh) Your stylish mess of silver hair 
(The love) A woman of your kind is rare 
(My love) Your uniform returns to air 
(My love) G.L.O.R.I.A. is love (ooh)
(The love) My friend
(My love) My friend
(My love) My friend
(Ooh) And now it's time for you to go 
(The love) You taught me most of what I know 
(My love) Where would I be without you, Glo?
(My love) G.L.O.R.I.A. is love (ooh)
(The love) My friend 
(My love) My friend
(My love) My friend
(Ooh) I see you standing by the sea 
(The love) The waves you made will always be 
(My love) A kiss goodbye before you leave 
(My love) G.L.O.R.I.A. is love
My friend
My friend
My friend
