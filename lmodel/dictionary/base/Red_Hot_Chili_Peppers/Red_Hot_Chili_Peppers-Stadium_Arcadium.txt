<song artist="Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers" title="Stadium_Arcadium">
Bells around St. Petersburg
When I saw you
I hope I get what you deserve
And this is where I find
Smoke surrounds your perfect face
And I'm falling
Pushing a broom out into space
And this is where I found a way 
The stadium arcadium 
A mirror to the moon (mirror to the moon)
Well I'm forming and I'm warming (to you)
State of the art until the clouds come crashing
Stranger things have happened both
Before and after noon (before and after noon)
Well I'm forming and I'm warming (to you)
Pushing myself, and no, I don't mind asking now
Alone inside in my forest room
And it's storming
I never thought I'd be in bloom 
But this is where I start
(Derelict days and the stereo plays
For the all night crowd that it cannot phase)
And I'm calling 
(Tedious weeds that the media breeds
But the animal gets what the animal needs)
And I'm sorry
The stadium arcadium 
A mirror to the moon (mirror to the moon)
And I'm forming and I'm warming (to you)
State of the art until the clouds come crashing
Stranger things have happened both
Before and after noon (before and after noon)
Well I'm forming and I'm warming (to you)
Pushing myself, and no, I don't mind asking now
And this is where I find
Rays of dust that wrap around 
Your Citizen
Kind enough to disavow
This is where I stand 
The stadium arcadium 
A mirror to the moon (mirror to the moon)
Well I'm forming and I'm warming (to you)
A state of the art until the clouds come crashing
Stranger things have happened both
Before and after noon (before and after noon)
And I'm forming and I'm warming (to you)
I'm pushing myself, and no, I don't mind asking
The stadium arcadium 
A mirror to the moon (mirror to the moon)
Well I'm forming and I'm warming (to you)
State of the art until the clouds come crashing
Stranger things have happened both
Before and after noon (before and after noon)
And I'm forming and I'm warming to you
