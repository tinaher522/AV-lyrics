<song artist="Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers" title="Police_Station">
I saw you at the police station and it breaks my heart to say
Your eyes had wandered off to something distant cold and grey
I guess you didn't see it coming
Someone's gotten used to slumming
Dreaming of the golden years
I see you had to change careers
Far away, but we both know it's somewhere
I saw you on the back page of some free press yesterday
The driftwood in your eyes said nothing short of love for pay
I know you from another picture
Someone with the most conviction
We used to read the funny papers
Fooled around and pulled some capers
Not today, I send a message to her
A message that I'm coming, coming to pursue her
Down home country I rest my face on your bed
I got you ten times over, I'll chase you down 'til you're dead
I saw you on a TV station and it made me wanna pray
An empty shell of loveliness now dusted with decay
What happened to the funny paper?
Smiling was your money maker
Someone oughta situate her
Find a way to educate her
All the way, time to come and find you
You can't hide from me girl so never mind what I do
Down home country I rest my face on your bed
I met my soul mate country and I left it all for your head
I saw you in the churchyard there was no time to exchange
You were getting married and it felt so very strange
I guess I didn't see it coming
Now I guess it's me who's bumming
Dreaming of the golden years
You and I were mixing tears
Not today, not for me but someone
Never could get used to so now I will refuse to
Down home country, I rest my face on your bed
I met my soul mate country and I left it all for your head
I got my best foot forward and I'll chase you down 'til you're dead
