Magpies on fire
Making love like little wolves
Out on the porch
Can lead to medicine
Oh well I’m game
For anything at all
Scarecrow’s a liar
Spins a yarn and no one
Ever checked it out
To see if it was real
Sold you the moon
Now it’s time to fall
All along
It’s like a bird
Who’s trapped alone
Inside your cage, love
What more do you want
How much more can you take
I love my mistakes
I’ve been here before
All and all
It’s just the call
Of something wild
Beyond your room
There’s a changing
Of the major chord
Your minor threat
Will do…love
My gun misfired
Shot myself instead
I guess I always knew
I’d be the one to lose
That screen door slams
Time to make a move
What more do you want
How much more can you take
I love my mistakes
I’ve been here before
All in all it’s like the bird trapped alone inside the cage, love
A bird who’s born
To live at half your age, girl
A bird who’s
Never really had a say
What more do you want
How much more can you take
I love my mistakes
I’ve been here before
Least of all
She’s like a bird
Who’s now been freed
From someone’s cage
