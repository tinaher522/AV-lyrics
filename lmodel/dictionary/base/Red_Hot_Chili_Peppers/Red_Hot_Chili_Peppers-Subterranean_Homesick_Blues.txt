Johnny's in the basement mixing up the medicine
I'm on the pavement thinking about the government
Man in the trench coat, badge out, laid off,
Says he's got a bad cough: he wants to get paid off (paid off)
Pay him off
God knows when but you're doin' it again!
You better duck down the alleyway lookin' for a new friend
Man in the coonskin cap in the big pen
Wants eleven dollar bills: you only got ten
So look out, kid
Look out, kid, because it's somethin' that you did, kid
Look out, kid, because they keep it all hid (look out)
Maggie comes fleet foot, face full of black soot
Talkin' that the heat put plants in the bedroom but
The phone's tapped anyway, Maggie says that many say
They must bust in early May
Orders from the D.A.
The double D.A.
Walkin' on your tip toes, don't try "no doz"
You better stay away from those that carry around a fire hose
Keep a clean nose, and an eye on the plain clothes
'Cause you don't need a weather man to know which way the wind blows
Look out, kid
Look out, kid, because it's somethin' that you did, kid
Look out, kid, because they keep it all hid (look out)
Looks to me like you did
A little too much hittin' kid
You should've took it to the bridge
Before you started to skid
Look out, kid
The good god willin', we'll bebop to Bob Dylan
Chillin' em, thrillin' em, and red hot killin' em
Killin' em
I said killin' em
Come on, come on
Get sick, get well, hang around the ink well
Ring a bell, hard to tell if anything is goin' to sell
Try hard, get barred, jump back, write braille
Get jailed, jump bail, join the army if you fail
Users, cheaters, and the six time losers
Hang around the theatres
Girl by the whirlpool lookin' for a new fool
Don't follow leaders, watch the parkin' meters
Look out, kid
Look out, kid, because it's somethin' that you did, kid
Look out, kid, because they keep it all hid
Look out, kid, because it's somethin' that you did, kid
Look out, kid, because they keep it all hid
Look out
