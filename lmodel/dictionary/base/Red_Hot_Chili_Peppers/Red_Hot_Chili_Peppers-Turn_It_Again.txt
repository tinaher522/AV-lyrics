<song artist="Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers" title="Turn_It_Again">
Some of us get a little and some a lot
We've got to make due with what ever we got
We get it hot, we cool it down and then we pass it around
You can dance for the sake of a golden day
Take a chance on getting rid of whatever's in your way
Next stop, big hop, it's turning night into day
Sometimes when I'm lying there all alone
I think of every little nothing that we could own
To overthrow all of you who have overgrown
All my friends
Like to spend
Days on end
On the mend
I turn to you, I turn into and then I turn it again
Here we go
All we know
Heavy load
Start to float
Without a doubt we turn it out and then we turn it again
I've come to learn whatever time I can find to spend
Taking flight into whatever light we bend
Out in the street I get a beat and then I turn it to ten
Lace boots and the ladies of Kazakhstan
Kick 'em high to the sky
All of this just because we can
I turn to Cuba then Aruba then the Dominican
All my friends
Like to spend
Days on end
On the mend
I turn to you, I turn into and then I turn it again
Here we go
All we know
Heavy load
Start to float
Without a doubt we turn it out and then we turn it again
(Two things I want to say now
You make it all okay now
I need to know that you are there)
We've got to move it if we want to do our best
We've got to shake it if we want to keep it fresh
I'm turning down all the heavy psychology
To cut a rug and I make no apology
I turn a cheek, I turn a key and then I turn it for free
We've got to move it just a little to hit the spot
A whirling dervish in a flurry, a fox to trot
Come clown around, a robot doing the astronaut
All my friends
Like to spend
Days on end
On the mend
I turn to you, I turn into and then I turn it again
Here we go
All we know
Heavy load
Start to float
Without a doubt we turn it out and then we turn it again
(Two things I want to say now
You make it all okay now
I need to know that you are there)
