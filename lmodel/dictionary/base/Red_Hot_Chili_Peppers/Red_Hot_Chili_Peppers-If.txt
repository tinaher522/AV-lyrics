<song artist="Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers" title="If">
And if I had a clue
I'd know exactly what do to
If I were the wiser of the two
And if I saw it all so clear
I'd write it down and bend your ear
If I were the clearer of the two
We can take a walk
Into the canyons of 5th Avenue
Sing and dance just to name a few
All I do
All I do
And if I heard the angels sing
I'd sing it back to you and bring
Sound of heaven ringing just for you
And if I saw the sun fall down
I'd pick it up and make a crown
One that was a perfect fit for you
We can take a walk
Into the apple orchard by the school
We could make a little residue
We can find a place to stay
A secret little hideaway
Spend a little time inside of you
All I do
All I do
All eyes
All eyes
All eyes on you (hey...)
All I do (hey...)
All I do
All I do (hey...)
All I do
