<song artist="Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers" title="Warlocks">
Warlocks in wonderland, I've got a
Megatropolis in my hand and a
Subterranean marching band that making noise for the boys in the Vatican and a
Little package and off we go, oh ticky-ticky tackety tic-tac-toe, I know
Everybody's an Eskimo, we've got another thing coming and that's our show, well
Every night I go looking for you
Everyone in the world adores you
A little packet of something kind to find your reason
Coming up on it every day for
Look at me and it's what I stay for
A little locket of fantasy that we believe in
Lilacs and contraband, I've got
Santa Monica in my hand a little
Beatlemania when I can I've got
Two big bags of old Japan, oh
Ring side and blow-by-blow, another
Main event at the old rainbow, we're coming
Right on top of the tupelo when she looks just like Bridgette Bardot
Every night I go looking for you
Everyone in the world adores you
A little packet of something kind to find your reason
Coming up on it every day for
Look at me and it's what I stay for
A little locket of fantasy that we believe in
Make a deal with Uncle Weezer
Sign your name to claim
Chi-China Chow will try to please her
Sweetness came from Jane
Warlocks in wonderland, I've got a
Rockapotamus in my hand with a
Happy ending that's made of sand
With a little bit of loving is all I plan
Every night I go looking for you
Everyone in the world adores you
A little packet of something kind yo find your reason
Coming up on it every day for
Look at me and it's what I stay for
A little locket of fantasy that we believe in
Every night I go looking for you
Everyone in the world adores you
A little packet of something kind to find your reason
Coming up on it every day for
Look at me and it's what I stay for
A little locket of fantasy that we believe in now
