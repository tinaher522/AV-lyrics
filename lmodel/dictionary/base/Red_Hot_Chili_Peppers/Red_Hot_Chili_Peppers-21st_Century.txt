<song artist="Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers" title="21st_Century">
All the creatures
On the beaches
Making waves in the motion picture
Won't you keep this
In between us?
Search and seizure, wake up Venus
The dollar bill will
Mentally ill Bill
Mom and Dad take your "don't be sad" pill
Turn the screw and
Twist my language
Don't forsake me I'm contagious
There's a reason for the 21 century
Not too sure but I know that it's meant to be
And that it's meant to be
It's my favorite
Combination
Coming down with the favorite nations
Deep flirtation
Mutilation
Learn to give and take dictation
Oh
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
Like the Cain and Abel
Oh
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
Time to run this table
There's a reason for the 21 century
Not too sure but I know that's it's meant to be
And that it's meant to be
Read me your scripture and
Read me your scripture
Read me your scripture and I will twist it
Show me your wrist and I
Show me your wrist and
Show me your wrist and I'll kiss it, kiss it
Oh
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
Like the Cain and Abel
Oh
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
It's time to run this table
Simple soldier
Hand it over
Stop and read what you just wrote her
Strangulation
Altercation
Oral sex and bird migration 
There's a reason for the 21 century
Not too sure but I know that it's meant to be
And that it's meant to be
C'mon 
There's a reason for the 21 century
Not too sure but I know that it's meant to be
And that it's meant to be
