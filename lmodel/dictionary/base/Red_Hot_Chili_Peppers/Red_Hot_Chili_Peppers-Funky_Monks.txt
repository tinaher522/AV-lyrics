<song artist="Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers" title="Funky_Monks">
There are no monks in my band (There are no monks in my band)
There are no saints in this land (There are no saints in this land)
I'll be doing all I can, yeah-yeah
If I die an honest man (If I die an honest man)
Confusion is my middle name (Confusion is my middle name)
Ask me again, I'll tell you the same (Ask me again I'll tell you the same)
Persuaded by one sexy dame, yeah-yeah
No, I do not feel no shame
You are all alone
Can I get a little loving from you?
Can I get a little bit of that done did do?
You are on the road
Tell me now, girl, that you need me too, oh
Tell me now, girl, 'cause I've got a feeling for you
Every man has certain needs (Every man has certain needs)
Talking 'bout them dirty deeds (Talking 'bout them dirty deeds)
To these needs I must concede, yeah-yeah
Living by my lowly creed (Living by my lowly creed)
Woman, please know that I'm good (Woman, please know that I'm good)
Know that I did all I could (Know that I did all I could)
But yes, it's truly likelihood, yeah-yeah
Of being great is not so good
You are all alone
Can I get a little loving from you?
Can I get a little bit of that done did do?
You are on the road
Tell me now, girl, that you need me too, oh
Tell me now, girl, 'cause I've got a feeling for you
There are no monks in my band (There are no monks in my band)
There are no saints in this land (There are no saints in this land)
I'll be doing all I can, yeah-yeah
If I die an honest man (If I die an honest man)
Virtue slipped into my shoe (Virtue slipped into my shoe)
No, I will not misconstrue (No, I will not misconstrue)
More rocking, more rocking now doobley-doo, yeah-yeah
Dancing down your avenue
You are all alone
Can I get a little loving from you?
Can I get a little bit of that done did do?
You are on the road
Tell me now, girl, that you need me too, oh
Tell me now, girl, 'cause I've got a feeling for you
