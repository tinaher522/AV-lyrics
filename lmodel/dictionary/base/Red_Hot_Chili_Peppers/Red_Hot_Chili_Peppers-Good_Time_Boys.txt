<song artist="Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers" title="Good_Time_Boys">
Hey yeah
Indeed it may seem that we have strange ways
But we do it with compassion and don't believe in age
Travel 'round the world, getting naked on the stage
Busting people out of their everyday cage
We like to think we make a sad man happy
And we like to make proud our mammy and pappy
Funky young kings, we sing of truth and soul
We're the modern day braves with one strong hold
Through the world of song, our boldness is exposed
I'm talking 'bout my buddies - funk it up, Fishbone
Hey yeah
Good, good time boys
Make me feel good
Give me good times
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Good, good time boys
Make me feel good
Give me good times
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Our devotion to emotion is more than evident
To the minds that are open, it's you we represent
We hope you have enjoyed the time that you have spent
One day the good time boys might just be president
Like a pack of mad hatters who come from outer space
Our swinging's gonna shatter every stone cold face
Now, you may not know the exact reason why
A band commands attention from the mountains and the sky
Making more than money, more than money can buy
Stop and take a listen to the monsters try
Good, good time boys
Make me feel good
Give me good times
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Good, good time boys
Make me feel good
Give me good times
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Got me boning
I'm gonna try, try, try, try, try
She's a, she's a, she's a white girl
If you don't believe me, you can ask John Doe
'Cause his heart is made of glory, his voice is made of gold
He'll tell you in a minute about the men he knows
He'll tell you 'bout a band called fIREHOSE
To those of you who doubt the nature of our spirit
We play it out loud for everyone to hear it
Building up our brains with the supernatural powers
We take it from the trees and the mighty Watts Towers
Aim the flame of freedom at the lames and sours
We're the best of the west and the west is ours
Good, good time boys
Make me feel good
Give me good times
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Good, good time boys
Make me feel good
Give me good times
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Good, good time boys
Make me feel good
Give me good times
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Good, good time boys
Make me feel good
Give me good times
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Rock it to the bottom
Let's funk it to the bottom
Let's rock it to the bottom
Let's funk it to the bottom
Let's rock it to the bottom
Let's funk it to the bottom
Let's rock it to the bottom
Let's funk it to the bottom
Let's rock it to the bottom
Let's funk it to the bottom
Let's rock it to the bottom
Let's funk it to the bottom
Let's rock it to the bottom
Let's funk it to the bottom
Let's
