<song artist="Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers" title="The_Righteous_&_The_Wicked">
I can't rest in war
Will you be my friend?
Dark Ages never change
Well, I can't comprehend
Kiss me, we self destruct
Can you hear me Lord?
Yes, I think we're fucked
But I can't rest in war
(Righteous and the wicked on the war and peace)
The righteous and the wicked, war and peace
The killing fist of the human beast
P.O.P., Prodigies of peace
Hear me when I'm calling you from my knees
I am praying for a better day, oh yeah
I am praying for a better day, anyway, oh yeah
I am praying for a better day, okay
Holy Mother Earth
Crying into space
Tears on her pretty face
For she has been raped
Killing your future blood
Fill her with disease
Global abortion, please
That is what she needs
(Righteous and the wicked on the war and peace)
The righteous and the wicked, war and peace
The killing fist of the human beast
P.O.P., Prodigies of peace
Hear me when I'm calling you from my knees
I am praying for a better day, oh yeah
Playing for a better day, every way
Are we fireflies
Flashing in the night?
Big thunder rumble fish
Did you get it right?
Headstrong battle song
Exploding souls be gone
Marvin Gaye, my love
Where did we go wrong?
(Righteous and the wicked on the war and peace)
The righteous and the wicked, war and peace
The killing fist of the human beast
P.O.P., Prodigies Of Peace
Hear me when I'm calling you from my knees
I am praying for a better day, yeah
