<song artist="Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers" title="Meet_Me_At_The_Corner">
Please don't ask me who 
Oh, who you think I am 
I could live with out that
I'm just a modest man
Meet at the corner, and oh 
Tell me what to do
Cause I'm messed up on you 
And had I known all that I do now
I'm guessing we're through now
Receding into the forest 
I will lay around and wait and I'll wait for you
Please don't ask me where
Oh, where you think I've been
I've been a lot of places
But this could be my win
Meet at the corner, and oh 
Tell me what to do
Cause I'm messed up on you
And had I known all that I do now
I'm guessing were through now
Receding into the forest 
I will lay around and wait and I'll wait for you
I feel so bad, I thought you'd wanna know
I feel so bad, I thought you'd wanna know
Something I wanna show
I thought you'd wanna know
Please don’t say you want
To keep in touch out there
To see you on the corner
Well that I just can’t bear
Meet me at the corner, and oh
Tell me what to do
Cause I'm messed up on you
And had I known all that I do now
I'm guessing were through now
Receding into the forest
I will lay around and wait
Hey and I turn
I turn my head when I thought I saw a sign from the gods
A sign from the gods that you weren't meant to be mine
And it's fine
Taking it all for a ride
'Til the day when it's gone
Mystified by where it all went wrong
When it's gone
I live and I learn
And I lose and I win
But it's better than ever whenever I'm in
Thank you girl for everywhere that I've been
