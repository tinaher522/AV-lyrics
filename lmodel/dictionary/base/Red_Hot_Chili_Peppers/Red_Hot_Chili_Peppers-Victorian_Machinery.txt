Janey
You are my
Victorian machinery
(Breath yourself to life)
Later
Your tender shape
Is bending like the scenery
(Ride you like a bike)
You be the sail
And baby I’ll be the rudder
We could make it all day
Until it turns into butter
I saw your face
A seminal pleasure
I will love you forever
When I heeded your call
And every heavy endeavor
I’ll keep your place
Janey
Coming down
The mountain like a buffalo
(Seeds deep in your eyes)
Crazy
But then again
A girl could like it rough you know
(Makes up for her size)
You be the sail
And baby I’ll be the rudder
We could make it all day
Until it turns into butter
I saw your face
A seminal pleasure
I will love you forever
When I heeded your call
And every heavy endeavor
I’ll keep your place
Be yourself
When I saw your all today
You be the shack
And baby I’ll be the desert
There is nothing to lack
When there is nothing to measure
It’s all space
You are my victorian machinery
Nah nah nah nah nah
Jaded
Make a fist and knock me on the mood again
Leave yourself to lie
Later
Make me feel like I want more than you again
Rock me like the vibe
Crazy
Sing along just like they do in Budapest
On the rise 
You be the shack
And baby I'll be the desert
There is nothing to lack
When there is nothing to measure
It's all, all space
