Woop woop! Ha
Junior pimp at the old caf√©
Got to chase those girls around
Westbound drunk with lots to say
But he never makes a sound
Hustlers get what they deserve
But it's always half the gate
Good things come to those who wait
Like an expiration date
See you around, I'll see you around
I'll play all night, can't get uptight
I'll lead all your mind games astray
When I see you around, I'll see you around
I'll play all night, can't get uptight
See you, so long, goodbye, hooray
Awww
Curb your tongue, oh scallywag
Because you got no flag to wave
Save your breath for the black and white
Every dog will have its day
See you around, I'll see you around
I'll play all night, can't get uptight
I'll lead all your mind games astray
When I see you around, I'll see you around
I'll play all night, can't get uptight
See you, so long, goodbye, hooray
When I see you around, I'll see you around!
Aw yeah
Aw yeah
Aw yeah
I'll see you around, I'll see you around
I'll play all night, can't get uptight
I'll lead all your mind games astray
When I see you around, I'll see you around
I'll play all night, can't get uptight
See you, so long, goodbye, hooray
Well I'll see you around, I'll see you around
I'll see you around, I'll see you around
I'll see you around
Goodbye and hooray
When I see you around, I'll see you around oh nah nah nah no!
