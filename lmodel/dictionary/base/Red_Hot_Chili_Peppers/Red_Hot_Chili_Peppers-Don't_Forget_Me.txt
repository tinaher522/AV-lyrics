<song artist="Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers" title="Don't_Forget_Me">
I'm an ocean
In your bedroom
Make you feel warm, make you want to re-assume
Now we know it all for sure
I'm a dance hall
Dirty breakbeat
Make the snow fall up from underneath your feet
Not alone, I'll be there
Tell me when you want to go
I'm a meth lab
First rehab
Take it all off and step inside the running cab
There's a love that knows the way
I'm the rainbow
In your jail cell
All the memories of everything you've ever smelled
Not alone
I'll be there, tell me when you wanna go
So (sideways falling)
(More will be revealed my friend)
(Sideways falling) Don't forget me, I can't hide it
(More will be revealed my friend) Come again, get me excited
I'm an inbred
And a pothead
Two legs that you spread inside the tool shed
Now we know it all for sure
I could show you
To the free field
Overcome and more will always be revealed
Not alone
I'll be there, tell me when you wanna go
So (sideways falling)
(More will be revealed my friend)
(Sideways falling) Don't forget me, I can't hide it
(More will be revealed my friend) Come again, get me excited
So (sideways falling)
(More will be revealed, my friend)
(Sideways falling) Don't forget me, I can't hide it
(More will be revealed, my friend)
There's a match, now let me light it
I'm the bloodstain
On your shirt sleeve
Coming down and more are coming to believe
Now we know it all for sure
Make the hair stand
Up on your arm
Teach you how to dance inside the funny farm
Not alone
I'll be there, tell me when you wanna go
I'll be there, tell me when you wanna go
Come again and tell me when you wanna go
More will be revealed my friend
