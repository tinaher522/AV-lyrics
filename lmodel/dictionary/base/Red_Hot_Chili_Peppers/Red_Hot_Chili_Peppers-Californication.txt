<song artist="Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers" title="Californication">
Psychic spies from China try to steal your mind's elation
Little girls from Sweden dream of silver screen quotations
And if you want these kind of dreams, it's Californication
It's the
Edge of the world and all of western civilization
The sun may rise in the East, at least it's settled in a finer location
It's understood that Hollywood sells Californication
Pay your surgeon very well to break the spell of aging
Celebrity skin, is this your chin or is that war you're waging?
First-born unicorn
Hardcore soft porn
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Marry me, girl, be my fairy to the world, be my very own constellation
A teenage bride with a baby inside, getting high on information
And buy me a star on the Boulevard, it's Californication
Space may be the final frontier, but it's made in a Hollywood basement
And Cobain, can you hear the spheres singing songs off Station to Station?
And Alderaan's not far away, it's Californication
(Ooh ooh)
(Ooh ooh)
(Ooh ooh) Born and raised by those who praise control of population
(Ooh ooh) Everybody's been there and I don't mean on vacation
(Ooh ooh) First-born unicorn
(Ooh ooh) Hardcore soft porn
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Destruction leads to a very rough road, but it also breeds creation
And earthquakes are, to a girl's guitar, they're just another good vibration
And tidal waves couldn't save the world from Californication
(Ooh ooh)
(Ooh ooh)
(Ooh ooh) Pay your surgeon very well to break the spell of aging
(Ooh ooh) Sicker than the rest, there is no test, but this is what you're craving
(Ooh ooh) First-born unicorn
(Ooh ooh) Hardcore soft porn
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
