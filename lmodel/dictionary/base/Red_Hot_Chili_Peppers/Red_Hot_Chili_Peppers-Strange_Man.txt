<song artist="Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers" title="Strange_Man">
All of my love
And most of my fears
Been comin’ on strong
For most of my
Years add up
And end up in a song
Cellophane tweeds
And revenue streams
Blockin’ my shots
And killin’ my
Dreams that showed me
How to be the cause
Ooh ahh, yella, ooh ahh, hey ah what now
It’s the lifetime of a strange man
It’s a longtime for me, I see
She’s wants to belong and
I want to be free
Excommunicated
‘Cause there ain’t no guarantee
Ooh ahh, yella, ooh ahh
All of my friends
And enemies near
Were part of this dance
That put me right
Here we go
So glad I got this chance
Better know plans
And lesser known schemes
Were all about love
And less about
Me, I’d have to say
She wore the pants
That's oh!
It’s the lifetime of a strange man, that's right
It’s a longtime for me, uh-uh
She’s wants to belong and
I want to be free
Excommunicated
‘Cause there ain’t no guarantee
Woo! Yeah
Ahh
Go
Oh
I've been left...
It’s the lifetime of a strange man
It’s a longtime for me, I see
She’s wants to belong and
I want to be free
Excommunicated
‘Cause there ain’t no guarantee
It’s the lifetime of a strange man, that's me
It’s a long time for me, uh-uh
She wants to be rich
And I want to be free
Keep your plans elastic
‘Cause there ain’t no guarantee
