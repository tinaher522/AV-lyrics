<song artist="Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers" title="Hey">
Won't somebody come along and teach me how to keep it alive
To survive
Come along and show me something that I never knew in your eyes
Take away the tourniquet
I used to be so full of my confidence
I used to know just what I wanted and just where to go
More than ever I could use a coincidence
But now I walk alone and talk about it when I know
Hey, ah yeah, how long?
I guess I ought to walk away
Hey, ah yeah, so long
What you gonna do today?
I don't wanna have to, but I will
If that's what I'm supposed to do
We don't wanna set up for the kill
But that's what I'm about to do
Later on I'll cut you off when you're screaming into the phone
Hard to own
Anyway I wanna let you know that everything is on hold
What you gonna do to me?
You used to be so warm and affectionate
All the little things I used to hear my fairy say
But now you're quick to give in to your regret
I'll take the fall and now you gotta give it all away
Hey, ah yeah, how long?
I guess I ought to walk away
Hey, ah yeah, so long
What you gonna do today?
I don't wanna have to, but I will
If that's what I'm supposed to do
We don't wanna set up for the kill
But that's what I'm about to do
I don't wanna have to, but I will
If that's what I'm supposed to do
We don't wanna set up for the kill
But that's what I'm about to do
Hey, what would you say if I stayed?
Stay for a while if I may
Say it again and I'll come around
But not for the last time
Hey, what would you say if I changed?
Change everything with my name
Play it again and I'll come around, come around
But not for the last time, not for the last time
You used to be so warm and affectionate
I used to know just what I wanted and just where to go
And now you're quick to give into your regret
And now I walk alone and talk about it when I know
Hey, ah yeah, how long?
I guess you gotta walk away
Hey, ah yeah, so long
What you gonna do today?
Hey, ah yeah, how long
I guess you gotta get away
Hey, ah yeah, so long
What you gonna do today
