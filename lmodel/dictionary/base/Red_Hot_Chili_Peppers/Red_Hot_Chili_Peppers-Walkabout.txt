<song artist="Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers" title="Walkabout">
I think I'll go on a walkabout
And find out what it's all about
And that ain't hard
Just me and my own two feet
In the heat I've got myself to meet
A detective of perspective
I need to try to get a bigger eye
open wide
Bloodwood flowers in my gaze
Walkabout in a sunny days
Do me now
On a walkabout
You could do it in the city
You could do it in a zone
You could do it in desert
You could do the unknown
On a walkabout
High desert skies are what I spy
So fly - you gotta wonder why
The stingrays must be fat this year
I'm moving slow in my lowest gear
The digirido original man with a dream
I believe the Aborigine
On a walkabout
You could do it with a shuffle
You could do it with a stroll
You could do it with a stride
You could do the unknown
On a walkabout
A walk could cure most all my blues
Bare feet or in my two shoes
One two
I think I'll go on a walkabout
And find out what it's all about
Use your legs to rock it wide
Take a ride to the other side
