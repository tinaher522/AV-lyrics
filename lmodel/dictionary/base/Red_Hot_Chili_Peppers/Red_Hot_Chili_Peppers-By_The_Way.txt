<song artist="Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers" title="By_The_Way">
Standing in line to see the show tonight
And there's a light on heavy glow
By the way, I tried to say I'd be there
Waiting for
Dani the girl is singing songs to me
Beneath the marquee overload
Steak-knife
Card shark
Con job
Boot cut
Skin that flick
She's such a little DJ
Get there quick
By street but not the freeway
Turn that trick
To make a little leeway
Beat that nic
But not the way that we play
Dog town
Blood bath
Rib cage
Soft tail
Standing in line to see the show tonight
And there's a light on heavy glow
By the way, I tried to say I'd be there
Waiting for
Black jack
Dope dick
Pawn shop
Quick pick
Kiss that dyke
I know you want to hold one
Not on strike
But I'm about to bowl one
Bite that mic
I know you never stole one
Girls that like
A story so I told one
Songbird
Main line
Cash back
Hard top
Standing in line to see the show tonight
And there's a light on heavy glow
By the way, I tried to say I'd be there
Waiting for
Dani the girl is singing songs to me
Beneath the marquee of her soul
By the way, I tried to say I'd be there
Waiting for
Oh ah, kissed ya then I missed ya
Oh ah, kissed ya then I missed ya
Oh ah, kissed ya then I missed ya
Oh ah, kissed ya then I missed ya
Oh ah, kissed ya then I missed ya
Oh ah, kissed ya then I missed ya
Oh ah, kissed ya then I missed ya
Oh ah
Standing in line to see the show tonight
And there's a light on heavy glow
By the way, I tried to say I'd be there
Waiting for
Dani the girl is singing songs to me
Beneath the marquee of her soul
By the way, I tried to say I know you
From before
Standing in line to see the show tonight
And there's a light on heavy glow
By the way, I tried to say I'd be there
Waiting for
