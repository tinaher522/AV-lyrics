Start marching
'Cause you think you shot to number one
Counting days and
Skipping your stones into the sun
Over age and under thumb
But does it weigh a ton
I'll be yours tonight
Living the dream of a meteorite!
Start jumping 'cause
We've got something to say, yeah
Young lovers keep it pumping
In the streets of L.A., yeah
(Ba bo ba bi ba bo bap ba bo ba bi ba bo bop)
Short stroking doesn’t fly
Better to go for broke
(Ba bo ba bi ba bo bap ba bo ba ba)
Whatchu smoking Mary Jane?
And does it make you choke?
(Ba bo ba bi ba bo bap ba bo ba bi ba bo bop)
Jumping the fence, riding the rails
Can you take a joke?
(Ba bo ba bi ba bo bap ba bo ba ba)
I'll be yours today
Living the dream with a capital K!
Start jumping 'cause
We've got something to say, yeah
Young lovers keep it pumping
In the streets of L.A., yeah
Tell me now, I'll tell you how
Just show me where to send
Make time for love and your happiness
The Mothers Of Invention are the best
We all know and struggle with some loneliness
A tender mess for everyone I guess
I guess
Half blinded
I'm reminded how to find the stairs
Nickel and dimin'
Think it's time
To play some musical chairs
Dirty laundry
What a quandary
Ask her if she cares
I'll be yours and more
Better than ever like never before!
Start jumping 'cause
We've got something to say, yeah
Young lovers keep it pumping
In the streets of...
Make time for love and your happiness
The Mothers Of Invention are the best
We all know and struggle with some loneliness
A tender mess for everyone I guess
I guess.
(Ba bo ba bi ba bo bap ba bo ba bi ba bo bop)
Sweet talkin’
As I’m walkin’ thru your part of town
(Ba bo ba bi ba bo bap ba bo ba ba)
Never again
Will Johnny C a Love Supreme be found
(Ba bo ba bi ba bo bap ba bo ba bi ba bo bop)
Is it ever meant to be
And is it so profound?
(Ba bo ba bi ba bo bap ba bo ba ba)
Is it you and me
A billion to one make history
A history
Said yeah
Oh yeah
Said yeah
Oh yeah
Said oh yeah
Oh yeah!
