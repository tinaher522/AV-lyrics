<song artist="Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers" title="Mellowship_Slinky_In_B-Major">
I've got a mellowship, I've got a fellowship
I've got a nonstop "Yo swan" hello chip
Born to adore the big bad bison
Thunderstorm and a man like Tyson
Popcorn, peanuts, looking at big butts
No, I cannot keep my mouth shut
Rocking to the beat of the fabulous Forum
My Lakers, I adore 'em
Blush, my lady, when I tell her
That I do indeed love to smell her
Sopping wet, your pink umbrella
Do the dog with Isabella
I'm so in love, yes, with an artist
Imagination, he's the smartest
Robert Williams, stroke and splatter
I attest to your gray matter
Living kings, how true it rings
These are just a few of my favorite things
Good God, where's my sleigh now
Good God, playing for days now
Good God, well, any day now
Good God, take me away now
Good God, the purple haze now
Good God, the baddest of brains now
Good God, well, any day now
Good God, riding my sleigh now
Being that I'm the duke of my domain
My hat goes off to Mark Twain
Singing a song about what true men don't do
Killing another creature, that's kind of blue
Writing about the world of the wild coyote
Good man, Truman Capote
Talking about my thoughts 'cause they must grow
Cock my brain to shoot my load
I'm on the porch 'cause I lost my house key
Pick up my book, I read Bukowski
Can I get another kiss from you?
Kiss me right here on my tattoo
Good God, where's my sleigh now
Good God, playing for days now
Good God, well, any day now
Good God, take me away now
Good God, De Niro's insane now
Good God, racking my brain now
Good God, well, any day now
Good God, take me away now... take me away
Me, my friends and the sex machine
Do unto others like my brother, Bean
I know you've got a mother, so give her a hug
I know you've got a mother with a whole lotta love
Billy sings and Basie swings
These are just a few of my favorite things
These are just a few of my favorite things
These are just a few of my favorite things
These are just a few...  Ho
