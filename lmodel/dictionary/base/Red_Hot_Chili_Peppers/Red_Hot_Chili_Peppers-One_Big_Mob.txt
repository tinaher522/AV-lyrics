INTRO
(I am, you are me)
(I am, you are me)
(I am, you are me)
(I am, you are me)
(I am, you are me) good woman said you gotta believe
(I am, you are me)
(I am, you are me) submerge into the urge of we
(I am, you are me)
(I am, you are me) deliciously
(I am, you are me) the mystery
(I am, you are me) the mystery
CHORUS
One big mob (ah, yeah, ah, yeah)
One big mob (ah, yeah, ah, yeah)
Eh bara mala (ah, yeah, ah, yeah)
Eh bara mala (ah, yeah, ah, yeah)
(One big mob is)
Ooze into, into my noodle
East or west, shepherd or poddle
Lady bug pine tree
To mingle with the bumblebee
A lover to the Sun
And a brother to the cool breeze
(One big mob is)
CHORUS
(One big mob is)
We live in the city
We live in the jungle
It's time to be drinking
A thimble humble
Everything you ever see
Is never more than you and me
Give it on into the beauty of the mystery
(One big mob is all)
One big mob in one big home
A broken home
I'd like to share some air with you
Some air with you
A morning forest full of truths
The green is blue
The head that's getting pregnant lives
To give and give
What was I thinking in my head
The color red
Breaking hearts instead of bread
Something I said
Checkmated by frustration now
Need to be cut loose
A different kind of being lost
A sullen cost
INTRO
CHORUS
(One big mob is)
Scrawled upon the wall
Of a bathroom stall
A stranger wrote a note
That spoke to all
One, two
Buckle my shoe
Take care of me
'Cause I might be you
(One big mob is)
CHORUS
(One big mob is)
Picaboo Street in Timbuktu
Do I need repeat
That a boy named Sue
Rockin' to the beat
Of the kangaroo
Let me kiss your feet
And your forehead too
(One big mob is)
