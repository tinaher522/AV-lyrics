<song artist="Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers" title="Warped">
My tendency
For dependency
Is offending me
It's upending me
I'm pretending see
To be strong and free
From my dependency
It's warping me
So much love
So rare to dare
Afraid of
Ever being there
Take me home
I need repair
Take me please
To anywhere
Descended from
Demented men
Struggle with
The art of Gen
Please don't look
Too close at me
You might not like
What you see
Night craving
Sends me crawling
Beg for mercy oh
A vacancy
That's full of holes
Hold me please
I'm feeling cold
CHORUSÂ :
Descend all the way all the way
Everyday
Warped and scared
Of being there
