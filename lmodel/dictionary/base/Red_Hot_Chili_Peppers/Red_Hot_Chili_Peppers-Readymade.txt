<song artist="Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers" title="Readymade">
Ooh!
Readymade, readymade
Steady as the rhythm rolls
Readymade, readymade
And this is how the story goes
I got a cousin making beats deep down in Arizona
We're gonna rocket to Ramone's in the city of Pomona
Oh, readymade, readymade
Steady as the rhythm rolls
Readymade, readymade
And this is how the story goes
(Uh) And if I give to you my second sight
You got it
(Uh) And if I stay the course I'll stay the night
Come get it
Readymade, readymade
Baby oughta celebrate
Readymade, readymade
And now it's time to deviate
I got a sister making babies with a black and decker blowtorch
We gonna flop it all night in the middle of her back porch
Yeah, readymade, readymade
Get me out to celebrate
Readymade, readymade
And now it's time to deviate
(Uh) And if I give to you my second sight
You got it
(Uh) And if I stay the course I'll stay the night
Come get it
Oh, clean it up Johnny
Readymade, readymade
Rocking for the sake of slade
Readymade, readymade
Listen but don't be afraid
I got a brother making trouble  in the state of California
I wish I knew another way but I'm gonna have to clone ya
Hey
Readymade, readymade
Rock it for the circus slave
Readymade, readymade
Listen but don't be afraid
(Uh) And if I give to you my second sight
You got it
(Uh) And if I stay the course I'll stay the night
Come get it
