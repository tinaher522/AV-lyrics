<song artist="Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers" title="Brendan's_Death_Song">
If I die before I get it done, will you decide?
Take my words and turn them into signs that will survive
Because a long time ago I knew not to deprive
It's safe out there and now you're everywhere, just like the skies
You are love, you are the love supreme, you are the rise
And when you hear this, you know it's your jam, it's your goodbye
Like I said, you know I'm almost dead, you know I'm almost gone
And when the drummer drums, he's gonna play my song to carry me along
Like I said, you know I'm almost dead, you know I'm almost gone
And when the boatman comes to ferry me away to where we all belong
We all crossed when we were feeling lost, it's just the tide
Katari cried the day her lover died, she recognized
Because he gave her a life of real love, it's no surprise
The nights are long but the years are short when you're alive
Way back when would never be again, it was a time
It's gonna catch you, so glad I met you, to walk the line
Like I said, you know I'm almost dead, you know I'm almost gone
And when the drummer drums he's gonna play my song to carry me along
Like I said, you know I'm almost dead, you know I'm almost gone
And when the boatman comes to ferry me away to where we all belong
Come get me!
Hey! Hey!
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
Like I said, you know I'm almost dead, you know I'm almost gone
And when the drummer drums he's gonna play my song to carry me along
Like I said, you know I'm almost dead, you know I'm almost gone
And when the boatman comes to ferry me away to where we all belong
Let me live
So when it's time to die
Even the reaper cries
Let me die
So when it's time to leave
Another son will rise
I said yeah! Yeah, yeah! Yeah, yeahhhh!
I said yeah! Yeah, yeah! Yeah, yeahhhh!
(I said yeah! Yeah, yeah! Yeah, yeahhhh!)
Like I said, you know I'm almost dead, you know I'm almost gone
(I said yeah! Yeah, yeah! Yeah, yeahhhh!)
And when the drummer drums, he's gonna play my song to carry me along
(I said yeah! Yeah, yeah! Yeah, yeahhhh!)
Like I said, you know I'm almost dead, you know I'm almost gone
And when the boatman comes to ferry me away to where we all belong
Like I said, you know I'm almost dead, you know I'm almost gone
Like I said, you know I'm almost dead, you know I'm almost gone
Like I said, you know I'm almost dead, you know I'm almost gone
