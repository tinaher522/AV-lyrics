<song artist="Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers" title="Minor_Thing">
I change the key from C to D
You see to me it's just a minor thing, y'all
He knows everything
To re-adjust you've got to trust
That all the fuss it's just a minor thing, ya'll
He knows everything.
It's just a minor thing 
And I'm a minor King.
He knows everything.
You got your bit part,Mo-zart
Hot dart,Acceleration,
Pop art,Pistol chasing
Cat Fight intimidation
To read a mind, you've got to 
Re-define the line to make your circles sing y'all
He knows everything
You make a sound
The spell is bound to come around,
It's just a minor thing, y'all
He knows everything.
It's just a minor thing 
And I'm a minor King.
He knows everything.
You've got your bit part,Mo-zart,
Hot dart acceleration,
Pop art, Pistol chasin',
Cat Fight intimidation,
All Out interfacing,
Black Star motivation,
Vam-pire sugar Junkie
Data-Basin' infiltration
I change the key from C to D
You see to me it's just a minor thing, y'all
He knows everything,
To re-adjust you've gotta trust 
That all the fuss is just a minor thing, y'all
He knows everything.
It's just a minor thing 
And I'm a minor King.
It's just a minor thing
And I'm a minor King.
