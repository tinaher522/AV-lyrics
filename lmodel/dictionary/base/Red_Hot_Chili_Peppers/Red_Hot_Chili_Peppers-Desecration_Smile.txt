<song artist="Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers" title="Desecration_Smile">
All alone not by myself
Another girl bad for my health
I've seen it all through someone else and I
Another girl bad for my health
Celebrated but undisturbed
Serenaded by the terror bird
It's seldom seen and it's never heard, oh
Serenaded by the terror bird
Never in the wrong time or wrong place
Desecration is the smile on my face
The love I made is the shape of my space
My face, my face
Disintegrated by the rising sun
A rolling black out of oblivion, and I'd
Like to think that I'm your number one, oh
Rolling black out of oblivion
I wanna leave but I just get stuck
A broken record running low on luck
There's heavy metal coming from your truck, and I
Broken record running low on luck
Never in the wrong time or wrong place
Desecration is the smile on my face
The love I made is the shape of my space
My face, my face
We could all go down to Malibu and make some noise
Coca Cola doesn't do the justice she enjoys
We could all come up with something new to be destroyed
We could all go down
I love the feeling when it falls apart
I'm slow to finish but I'm quick to start and
Beneath the heather lies the meadowlark, and I'm
Slow to finish but I am quick to start
Never in the wrong time or wrong place
Desecration is the smile on my face
The love I made is the shape of my space
My face, my face
Never in the wrong time or wrong place
Desecration is the smile on my face
The love I made is the shape of my space
My face, my face, yeah
