<song artist="Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers" title="Tearjerker">
(Spoken)
Could you turn up the track a little bit, please
(Sung)
My mouth fell open
Hoping that the truth would not be true
Refuse the news
I'm feeling sick now
What the fuck am I supposed to do
Just lose and lose
First time I saw you
You were sitting backstage in a dress
A perfect mess
You never knew this
But I wanted badly for you to
Requite my love
Chorus :
Left on the floor
Leaving your body
When highs are the lows
And lows are the way
So hard to stay
Guess now you know
I love you so
I liked your whiskers
And I liked the dimple in your chin
Your pale blue eyes
You painted pictures
Cause the one who hurts can give so much
You gave me such
Chorus :
Left on the floor
Leaving your body
When highs are the lows
And lows are the way
So hard to stay
Guess now you know
I love you so
