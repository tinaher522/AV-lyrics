Lipstick junkie
Debunk the all-in-one
She came back wearing a smile
Lookin' like someone drugged me
That wanted to unplug me
No one in here is on trial
It's just a turn-around
And we go
Oh
Well and we go
Oh oh oh oh
Tick-tock, I want to
Rock you like the 80s
Cock-blocking isn’t allowed
Tug boat Sheila
Is into memorabilia
Who said three is a crowd?
We better get it on the go
Hey, now
We’ve gotta make it rain somehow
She told me too
And show me what to do
Our Maggie makes it in a cloud
I said
Hey now
We gotta make it rain somehow
She told me to
And showed me what to do
She knows how to make it loud
Rain dance Maggie
Advances to the final
Who knew that she had the goods?
Little did I know her body
Was warm delicious vinyl
To your neck of the woods
I want to lick a little bit
Hey now
We’ve gotta make it rain somehow
She told me to
And showed me what to do
Our Maggie makes it in a cloud
You got the wrong girl
But not for long girl
It's in the song girl
'Cause I’ll be gone girl
Hey now
We’ve gotta make it rain somehow
She told me to
And showed me what to do
Our Maggie makes it in a cloud
I said
Hey now
I want to rock this rowdy crowd
She told me to
And showed me what to do
She knows how to make it loud
But not for long girl
It's in a song girl
'Cause I’ll be gone, bye bye bye yeah
Bye bye bye girl
Bye bye bye girl
