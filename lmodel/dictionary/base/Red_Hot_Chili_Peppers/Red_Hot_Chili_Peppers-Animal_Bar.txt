<song artist="Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers" title="Animal_Bar">
Never twenty-one when everyone's a sailor
Coming up strong at the animal bar
Ever-loving mug of Mister Norman Mailer
Turn another page at the animal bar
And it won't be long
No, it won't be long
No, it won't be long
Because it can't be long
I, I, I, the cry of isolation
I, I, I, the high of meditation
I, I, I, the sweet precipitation
I, I, I, the high of depravation
And it won't be long
No, it won't be long
No, it won't be long
Because it can't be long
Rain on my frustration
Stake my claim, now break this
Wash me down my station
Makes more rain forsaken
In between the sky and every piece of the earth
One, two, three, let's make this
Running through the mud, I've got a feeling of worth
One, two, three, forsake this
All aboard the ship, 'cause you're gonna need an ark
When the wet comes down, you'll be swimming like a shark
Mopping up the pain and I'm a little older
Right as rain at the animal bar
And it won't be long
No, it won't be long
No, it won't be long
Because it can't be long
I, I, I, the cry of isolation
I, I, I, the high of meditation
I, I, I, the mild precipitation
I, I, I, the high of depravation
And it won't be long
No, it won't be long
No, it won't be long
Because it can't be long
Rain on my frustration
Stake my claim, now break this
Wash me down my station
Makes more rain forsaken
In between the sky and every piece of the earth
One, two, three, let's make this
Running through the mud, I've got a feeling of worth
One, two, three, forsake this
Raindrops will fall from the sky
Stealing their shape from your eye
Now we can all get some sleep
The water, the water, the water saving us from the heat
Some things will die in their place
Others will leave little trace
Fire will come by its day
The water, the water, the water washing it all away
Rain on my frustration
Stake my claim, now break this
Wash me down my station
Makes more rain forsaken
In between the sky and every piece of the earth
One, two, three, let's make this
In between the sky and every piece of the earth
One, two, three, forsake this
In between the sky and every piece of the earth
One, two, three, let's make this
In between the sky and every piece of the earth
One, two, three, forsake this
