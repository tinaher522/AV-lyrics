<song artist="Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers" title="Me_And_My_Friends">
Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my friends
Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my friends
Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my friends
Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my friends
Like two sweet peas in an even sweeter pod, well
That's my friend and my friends's named Bob
Like the devil knows hell, I know Bobby well
Well enough to tell you 'bout his sixty-seven smells
Well enough to tell you he's a hella, swella fella
Well enough to tell you that we know each other better than we know our selves
Like freaks of a feather, we rock together
I know Bobby well but I think he knows me better
Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my friends
Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my friends
Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my friends
Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my friends
He's as close to me as a friend can be
Well, I'll be standing by my buddy, he'll be standing by me
Just another half of the two-headed freak
But I need him like my heart needs to beat
At this point in this friendly verse
I've gotta sing a little something that I haven't rehearsed
It's about my man and his name is Hillel
For whom my love is soul-brother sacred
Take it, Huckleberry
Slim boy, take it
Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my friends
Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my friends
Jacky's eyes are closed but he's right on course
Because he's guided by the invisible force
He drives a kooky, green Chrysler, bad as anybody's Porsche
He's a working class drummer, he's as strong as a horse
Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my friends
Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my friends
