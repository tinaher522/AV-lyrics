<song artist="Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers" title="Coffee_Shop">
I am just a lousy burn
Searching for the unknown crumb
The crumb the crumb
Nothing or someone to come
Come along illuminate my lust
Combust
Confucius might have been confused
And Buddha might have blown a fuse
I ooze 
The muse
Meet me at the coffee shop
We can dance like Iggy Pop
Another go in the parking lot
Freak the cheek on your hotspot
Back and forth my body's jerking
Will to thrill will not stop working
Work and work
I'll take you on a honeymoon
Jumping on a bed in a hotel room
The room 
The groom
Meet me at the coffee shop
We can dance like Iggy Pop
Another go in the parking lot
Freak the cheek on your hotspot
