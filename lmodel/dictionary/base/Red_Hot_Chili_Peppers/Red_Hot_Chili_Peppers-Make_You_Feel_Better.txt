<song artist="Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers" title="Make_You_Feel_Better">
She's the one she's the only one
She's got ripped back light
Gonna make me come
I say... when I smile I'm a really smile
I got dreams so wide like a country mile
I said now, I'll take it
It's better for you
Somehow we'll make it
'Cause that's what we do
Pick a star in the open sky
I see you see me and that is why I
Hop along to the cowboy beat
When I feel your fire jump up to me
I said now, I'll take it
It's better for you
Somehow we'll make it
'Cause that's what we do
Something out there
Where love is your only friend and
We are the ones
That will make you feel better
Someone to spare
When love is the only end and
We are the ones
That will make you feel better
Oh yeah
In a world that has run amok
I've got to set my sights just to get struck
I walk away from the rank and file
With a punched out mouth and a pack of style
I say... she's the one she's the only one
Make me search myself until I'm done... and
Tell me now in a telegram
Do the sea of stars, make a diagram... and
Something out there
Where love is your only friend and
We are the ones
That will make you feel better
And, someone to spare
When love is the only end and
We are the ones
That will make you feel better
Oh yeah, hell yeah, yeah
Oh yeah
So alive I arrive on dust
You can search my mind for the red on rust... I said
Take me there and she really cares
Lighting up for me gonna hear my prayers
I said now, I'll take it
It's better for you
Somehow we'll make it
'Cause that's what we do
Something out there
Where love is your only friend and
We are the ones
That will make you feel better
Someone to spare
When love is the only end and
We are the ones
That will make you feel better
We are the ones
That will make you feel better
We are the ones
That will make you feel better
We are the ones
That will make you feel better
We are the ones
That will make you feel better, now
