<song artist="Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers" title="Hanalei">
Feeling good and I don’t know why
Another day and another high
I walk around like I am on the ray
Somewhere way in the rays of Hanalei
I met a girl and I liked her vibe
Another day and another ride
I met a girl who wants to save the world
Make it safe
For someone else to find their faith
I’m away, I’m away, I’m away, I’m away
I’m away, I’m away, I’m away
Hanalei
I’m away
A simple song and it made me cry
I really don’t want to pass me by
A simple song that spoke of Hemingway
The revolution in your blood
Creates the wave
I picked her up on the road to surf
Looked a lot like a Mother Earth
She said, "Hello, my name is Charlotte Gray", hey
Make it safe
For someone else to find their faith
I’m away, I’m away, I’m away, I’m away
I’m away, I’m away, I’m away
Hanalei
I’m away
