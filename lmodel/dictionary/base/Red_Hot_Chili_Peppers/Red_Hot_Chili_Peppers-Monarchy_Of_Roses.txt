<song artist="Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers" title="Monarchy_Of_Roses">
The crimson tide is flowing through
Your fingers as you sleep
The promise of a clean regime
Are promises we keep
Do you like it rough I ask
And are you up to task
The calicos of Pettibon
Where cultures come to clash
Several of my best friends wear
The colors of the crown
And Mary wants to build it up
And Sherri wants to tear it all back down girl
The savior of your light
The monarchy of roses
The monarchy of roses tonight
The cross between my former queen
Her legendary stare
The holy tears of Ireland
A lovely cross to bear
Several of my best friends know
The secrets of this town
And Mary wants to raise it up
And Sherri wants to spin it all around girl
The sailors of the night
The monarchy of roses
The monarchy of roses tonight
Several of my best friends wear
The colors of the crown
And Mary wants to build it up
And Sherri wants to tear it all back down girl
The savior of your light
The monarchy of roses
The monarchy of roses
Hey
We all want the rose you know
I said, hey
Show us love before you go
Say I will then say I want to
The story knows that I will never taunt you
Hey
We all want the rose you know
I said, hey
Show us love before you go
Say I will then say I want to
The story knows that I will always haunt you
Hey
