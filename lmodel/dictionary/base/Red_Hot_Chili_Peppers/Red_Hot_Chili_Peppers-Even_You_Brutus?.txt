<song artist="Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers" title="Even_You_Brutus?">
God is good and fate is great
When it feels so strong it's hard to wait
You never know how it might unfold
Hearts to break and bodies to hold
Time will tell but it never gets old
Like I told you, I'm in for the long long
Had to've been one of those things that took place in outer space
A match made in heaven, not a scratch on her face
Angels must have smoked some dust
Singing songs about "In God We Trust"
Some things slide but this is a must
Like I told you, there's a time for finding out
Ahh people try to tell me what not to do
"You shouldn't make it with a younger girl" and
Too many chances for the foot to drop
I tried to tell 'em that I found a pearl, well...
Like I told you, be careful what you're asking for
Hey, sister Brutus
I've got a mess of a better half, oww
Hey, sister Judas!
Even you never had my back
She was the cutest thing that I ever did see
A drink in her hand and I don't mean tea
She was with a dude but I just didn't care
I had to find out, these moments are rare
And Stevie says, "All is fair"
Like I told you, there is something for everyone
Well I guess I never told you some things
That I really, really wanted to say
Did I do everything I could do
Or did the mice just need to play?
Like I told you, there's more than meets the eye
Hey, sister Brutus
I've got a mess of a better half, oww
I said hey, sister Judas!
Even you never had my back
I'm not trying to point fingers at you
And I'm not trying to lay any blame
But when it comes to the punishment, girl
You know how to bring the pain
Like I told you, I'd do it all again
Hey, sister Brutus
I've got a mess of a better half, oww
I said hey, sister Judas!
Even you never had my back
Come on
Hey, sister Brutus
There’s a fury to the woman’s wrath, oww
Hey, sister Judas!
Even you never had my back
