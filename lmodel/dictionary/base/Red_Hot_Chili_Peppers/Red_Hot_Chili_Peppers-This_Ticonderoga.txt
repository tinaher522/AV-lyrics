<song artist="Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers" title="This_Ticonderoga">
I met a man in a rock and roll band
He said, "won't you come with me?"
I let him know that I could not go
You see, I get mine for free
We are all just soldiers
In this battlefield of life
One thing that's for certain
Is my burning appetite
Step inside the emotional ride
I could use some company
Illusionary is so damn scary
I call my best friend "Flea"
This Ticonderoga
Is an element that shines
Connected by the great unknown
Between us there are lines
Yes, I told her that I'm the older cat
Can I scratch your back all day?
I would not have it any other way
Well, means so much to me
Can you see the we?
What are we ever gonna do
When all I want to be is next to you?
I took a girl from the underworld
And I held her way too tight
When it's all been said and done
She was not up for the fight
We are all just soldiers
In this open field of time
Hoping to get with you
When you get right with your mind
It's my favorite, so I savor it
I must report that life is short
So, of your love I'll take ten quarts
Well, there's no end to this
Don't pretend to miss
You and you would not repent
For sitting on my elephant
And am I crazy to join the lazy zoo
All these human butterflies
And cactus flowers' swollen eyes
And I want the devil's share
Of you I do declare
Again I'm asking can I do
When all these animals
Want to be just like you
I met a girl with long black hair
And she opened up so wide
A daffodil growing in Brazil
And I picked her for my bride
We are all just soldiers
In this epic, loving flight
And no one that I know
Has ever really done it right
Done it right
Done it right
Done it right
Done it right
