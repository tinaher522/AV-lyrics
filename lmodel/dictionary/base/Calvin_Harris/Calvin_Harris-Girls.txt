<song artist="Calvin_Harris" title="Girls">
I like them black girls, I like them white girls
I like them Asian girls, I like them mix-raced girls
I like them Spanish girls, I like them Italian girls
I like the French girls and I like Scandinavian girls
I like them tall girls, I like them short girls
I like them brown haired girls, I like them blond haired girls
I like them big girls, I like them skinny girls
I like them carrying a little-bitty weight girls
Now baby, I've got a lot of love to give
And I've been over-oversubscribed with relationships
See you've got a little thing I haven't seen before
But I must warn ya that I can't help but play around for sure
For sure because
I get all the girls, I get all the girls
I get all the girls, I get all the girls
I get all the girls, I get all the girls
I get all the girls, I get all the girls
I get all the girls, I get all the girls
I get all the girls, I get all the girls
I get all the girls, I get all the girls
I get all the girls, I get all the girls
Now maybe I can learn to settle down one day
But right now I'm livin' life to mess around and play
See you've got a little thing I haven't seen before
But I must warn ya that I can't help but play around for sure
I did it before
I get all the girls, I get all the girls
I get all the girls, I get all the girls
I get all the girls, I get all the girls
I get all the girls, I get all the girls
I get all the girls, I get all the girls
I get all the girls, I get all the girls
I get all the girls, I get all the girls
I get all the girls, I get all the girls
I like them black girls, I like them white girls
I like them Asian girls, I like them mix-raced girls
I like them Spanish girls, I like them Italian girls
I like the French girls and I like Scandinavian girls
I like them tall girls, I like them short girls
I like them brown haired girls, I like them blond haired girls
I like them big girls, I like them skinny girls
I like them carrying a little-bitty weight girls
I get all the girls, I get all the girls
I get all the girls, I get all the girls
I get all the girls, I get all the girls
I get all the girls, I get all the girls
I get all the girls, I get all the girls
I get all the girls, I get all the girls
I get all the girls, I get all the girls
I get all the girls, I get all the girls
