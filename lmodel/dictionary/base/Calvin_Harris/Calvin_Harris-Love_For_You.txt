<song artist="Calvin_Harris" title="Love_For_You">
Yeah. Yeah.
Now would you stop me if I'm right?
I think about it every night.
I've been in fashion from the start.
I've been unselfish with my heart.
And if I've been around the world.
Met a million different girls.
You'd still be in with half a chance,
if you were born in the eighties,
the eighties.
I've got love for you if you were born in the eighties,
the eighties.
I've got hugs for you if you were born in the eighties,
the eighties.
I'll do things for you if you were born in the eighties,
the eighties.
I've got hugs for you if you were born in the eighties.
Yeah.
Now would you stop me if I'm right?
I think about it every night.
I've been in fashion from the start.
I've been unselfish with my heart.
And if I've been around the world.
Met a million different girls.
You'd still be in with half a chance,
if you were born in the eighties,
the eighties.
I've got love for you if you were born in the eighties,
the eighties.
I've got hugs for you if you were born in the eighties,
the eighties.
I'll do things for you if you were born in the eighties,
the eighties.
I've got hugs for you if you were born in the eighties.
Yeah.
