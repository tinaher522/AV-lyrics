<song artist="Calvin_Harris" title="We'll_Be_Coming_Back">
We took it all apart, but I’m wishing I’d stayed
In the backroom something I heard you say
We didn’t wanna call it too early, now it seems a world away
But I miss that day, are we ever gonna feel the same?
Standing in the light 'till it’s over, out of our minds
Someone had to draw a line
We’ll be coming back for you one day
We’ll be coming back for you one day
I don’t even care if I know you, out of our minds
Sad to leave it all behind
We’ll be coming back
We’ll be coming back for you one day
You can see it from afar, we were riding that wave
Blinded by the lights, and it's something I crave
We didn't wanna call it too early, now it seems a world away
But I miss that day, are we ever gonna feel the same?
Standing in the light 'till it’s over, out of our minds
Someone had to draw a line
We’ll be coming back for you one day
We’ll be coming back for you one day
I don’t even care if I know you, out of our minds
Sad to leave it all behind
We’ll be coming back for you one day
We’ll be coming back for you one day
Gonna rise, gonna fall, getting pulled apart
And we all do it all 'cause it stole our hearts
Gonna light up the skies, so ignore the stars
And we all do it all 'cause it stole our hearts
Standing in the light 'till it’s over, out of our minds
Someone had to draw a line
We’ll be coming back for you one day
We’ll be coming back for you one day
I don’t even care if I know you, out of our minds
Sad to leave it all behind, we’ll be coming back
We’ll be coming back for you one day
We’ll be coming back for you one day
