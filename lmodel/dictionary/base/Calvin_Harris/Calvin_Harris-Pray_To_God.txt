<song artist="Calvin_Harris" title="Pray_To_God">
Oh
I remember when this world was my own
I pray to God
I just don't know anymore
I pray to God
I just don't know anymore
And more
I lost the feeling but I tried to hold on
I thought the end of lovin' would made you strong
I pray to God
I just don't know anymore
When there's no getting through
I won't hold back
I will throw down everything in life 
I know now
I've been lying on the floor, sleeping on the ground
I will give up everything in life 
I know how
Cause I can't stop wondering if I was too late to see the signs
If I could go back with hands up
I'd look up to the sky
And give in 
I'd give in
I'd give in
I'd give in to you
Give in to you
Oh, when the moon was shining bright before morning
I made a deal with the stars to keep holding
Shining bright to come and bring me back home
The lights in my eyes, they disappeared
Have visions in my mind I got to keep me from fear
I won't let it hold me down, the other way around
I know all the words still I can't make a sound
Cause I can't stop wondering if I was too late to see the signs
If I could go back with hands up
I'd look up to the sky
And give in 
I'd give in
I'd give in
I'd give in to you
Give in to you
Can't hold back, reaching out
Huh huh
I was living in the heat of the moment
Between us, I told you then
Huh huh
I was living in the heat of the moment
I'd give in
Huh huh
I was living in the heat of the moment
I'd give in
Huh huh
I was living in the heat of the moment
I'd give in
Huh huh
I was living in the heat of the moment
I'd give in to you
Give in to you
And give in 
I'd give in
I'd give in
I'd give in to you
Give in to you
Give in 
I'd give in
I'd give in
I'd give in to you
Give in to you
