<song artist="Calvin_Harris" title="Drinking_From_The_Bottle">
I could pay for everything that's on you
So everything is on me
Got them girls going Cindy Lauper, Gaga and a little Blondie
If you ain't drunk, then you in the wrong club
Don't feel sexy, you're on the wrong beat
Tell the bar that we don't want no glass
Just bottles and i'm buying everybody one each
Yes so bring the Veuve Clicquot
D about to hit the big 3 0
Party like it's Carnival in Rio
Life's too short, Danny Devito
Yo, we live, we die, we give, we try, we kiss, we fight
All so we can have a good time
I'm in here busy looking for the next top model
Who's wearing something new and something old
And something borrowed
I know this crazy life can be a bitter pill to swallow
So forget about tomorrow
Tonight, we're drinking from the bottle
We're drinking from the bottle
Yeah, I was done with this thing
Getting it wrong then everything is alright
Got them girls going Heidi Klum, the Kardashians, Rihanna, all types
If you ain't lean, then you in the wrong scene
If you ain't high, then you not on my vibe
Tell the bar that we don't need to sparklers or nothin',
Keep the bottles coming all night
Yes so bring the Veuve Clicquot
D about to hit the big 3 0
Party like it's Carnival in Rio
Life's too short, Danny Devito
Yo, we live, we die, we give, we try, we kiss, we fight
All so we can have a good time
I'm in here busy looking for the next top model
Who's wearing something new and something old
And something borrowed
I know this crazy life can be a bitter pill to swallow
So forget about tomorrow
Tonight, we're drinking from the bottle
We're drinking from the bottle
I'm in it busy looking for the next top model
I'm in it busy looking for the next top model
I'm in it busy looking for the next top model
I'm in it busy looking for the next top model
So forget about tomorrow
Tonight,we're drinking from the bottle
We're drinking from the bottle
We're drinking from the bottle...
