<song artist="Calvin_Harris" title="Feel_So_Close">
I feel so close to you right now
It's a force field
I wear my heart upon my sleeve
Like a big deal
Your love bows down on me
Surround me like a waterfall
And there's no stopping us right now
I feel so close to you right now
I feel so close to you right now
It's a force field
I wear my heart upon my sleeve
Like a big deal
Your love bows down on me
Surround me like a waterfall
And there's no stopping us right now
I feel so close to you right now
And there's no stopping us right now
And there's no stopping us right now
And there's no stopping us right now
I feel so close to you right now
