<song artist="Calvin_Harris" title="Let's_Go">
Let’s go, make no excuses now
I’m talking here and now, I’m talking here and now
Let’s go, your time is running out
I’m talking here and now, I’m talking here and now
It’s not about what you’ve done, it’s about what you doing
It’s all about where you going, no matter where you’ve been
Let’s go
Let’s go
Let’s go
Let’s go
Let’s go
Hey, it's now or never, ohoho!
Ohoho, let's go
Tomorrow is good, tonight is better, ohoho
Ohoho, let's go
There is no better time
I’m talking here and now, I’m talking here and now
Let’s go, right now is where you shine
I’m talking here and now, I’m talking here and now
It’s not about what you’ve done, it’s about what you doing
It’s all about where you going, no matter where you’ve been
Let’s go
Let’s go
Let’s go
Let’s go
Let’s go
Hey, it's now or never, ohoho!
Ohoho, let's go
Tomorrow is good, tonight is better, ohoho
Ohoho
Let’s make it happen
Oooh, let’s make it happen tonight
Let’s make it happen
Oooh, let’s make it happen tonight
Let’s make it happen
Oooh, let’s make it happen tonight
Let’s make it happen
Oooh, let’s make it happen tonight, tonight
Let’s go
Let's go
Oooh, let's go
Hey, it's now or never, ohoho!
Ohoho, let's go
Tomorrow is good, tonight is better, ohoho
Oooh, let's go
