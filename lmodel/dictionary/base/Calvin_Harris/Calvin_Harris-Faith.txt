<song artist="Calvin_Harris" title="Faith">
I need a little space in my mind
I need that little hope I can find
I need a little, I need a little faith
Is that too much to ask for?
I need to feel my soul come alive
I need to feel the strength to get by
I need a little, I need a little faith
Is that too much to ask for?
To ask for, too ask for, to ask for?
I need a little space in my mind
I need that little hope I can find
I need a little, I need a little faith
Is that too much to ask for?
I need to feel my soul come alive
I need to feel the strength to get by
I need a little, I need a little faith
Is that too much to ask for?
To ask for, too ask for, to ask for?
I need a little faith
I need a little faith
I need a little faith
Is that too much to ask for?
To ask for, too ask for, to ask for?
I need a little faith
I need a little faith
I need a little faith
Is that too much to ask for?
To ask for, too ask for, to ask for?
