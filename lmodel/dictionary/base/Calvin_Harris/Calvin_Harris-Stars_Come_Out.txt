<song artist="Calvin_Harris" title="Stars_Come_Out">
Lying in the grass
watching the stars come out
Come and get the dream
Ghosts right through the cemetery
Feel the morning rain
Dancing 'round the Colosseum
I can not explain
Something in your chemistry
Power to your brain
Power to the minds museum
Come and get the dream
Ghosts right through the cemetery
Feel the morning rain
Dancing round the Colosseum
I can not explain
Something in your chemistry
Power to your brain
We can watch the stars come out
Find out what we like about
Everyone, without a doubt
We can watch the stars come out
We can watch the stars come out
Find out what we like about
Everyone, without a doubt
We can watch the stars come out
We can watch the stars come out
Find out what we like about
Everyone, without a doubt
We can watch the stars come out
We can watch the stars come out
Find out what we like about
Everyone, without a doubt
We can watch the stars come out
Lying in the grass
watching the stars come out
Come and get the dream
Ghosts right through the cemetery
Feel the morning rain
Dancing 'round the Colosseum
I can not explain
Something in your chemistry
Power to your brain
We can watch the stars come out
Find out what we like about
everyone, without a doubt
We can watch the stars come out
We can watch the stars come out
Find out what we like about
Everyone, without a doubt
We can watch the stars come out
We can watch the stars come out
Find out what we like about
Everyone, without a doubt
We can watch the stars come out
We can watch the stars come out
Find out what we like about
Everyone, without a doubt
We can watch the stars come out
Lying in the grass
watching the stars come out
Lying in the grass
watching the stars come out
Watch the stars come out
Watch the stars come out
Watch the stars come out
Watch the stars come out
Watch the stars come out
Watch the stars come out
Watch the stars come out
Watch the stars come out
Watch the stars come out
Watch the stars come out
Watch the stars come out
Watch the stars come out
