<song artist="Calvin_Harris" title="Ready_For_The_Weekend">
"Counterfeit, counterfeit" that's what you're shouting at me
I could run but I'd sooner have this
And amicably lick the blood stain from your finger, say "what do you see?"
Remind you that whatever you get is what you want it to be (you want it to be)
You get a feeling, that's what you choose
And I was told there was not a minute to lose
So if you're waiting, jump out your skin
To find a cure for whatever state your in
I tell my good friends "get out the way"
Of all the lightning hitting the trees today
We get a thrill from clapping our hands
We find the nearest girl and ask her to dance
Ooh, I put on my shoes and I'm ready for the weekend
Ooh, I put on my shoes and I'm ready for the weekend, yeah
Ooh, I put on my shoes and I'm ready for the weekend
Ooh, I put on my shoes and I'm ready for the weekend, weekend, weekend, weekend
Coming back, coming back, to a place where I never knew
Pushing knobs, pushing faders, but I don't know what they do
This reflection in my mirror reminds me of you
When I tilt it towards the sunlight you fall out of view (you fall out of view)
You get a feeling, that's what you choose
And I was told there was not a minute to lose
So if you're waiting, jump out your skin
To find a cure for whatever state your in
I tell my good friends "get out the way"
Of all the lightning hitting the trees today
We get a thrill from clapping our hands
We find the nearest girl and ask her to dance
Ooh, I put on my shoes and I'm ready for the weekend
Ooh, I put on my shoes and I'm ready for the weekend, yeah
Ooh, I put on my shoes and I'm ready for the weekend
Ooh, I put on my shoes and I'm ready for the weekend, yeah
Ooh, I put on my shoes and I'm ready for the weekend, weekend, weekend, weekend
Ooh, I put on my shoes and I'm ready for the weekend, weekend, weekend, weekend
Ooh, I put on my shoes and I'm ready for the weekend, weekend, weekend, weekend
Ooh, I put on my shoes and I'm ready for the weekend, weekend, weekend, weekend
Ooh
