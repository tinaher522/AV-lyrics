<song artist="Calvin_Harris" title="Merrymaking_At_My_Place">
Merrymaking, drug taking
At my place, baby, at my place, merrymaking
Come in to my house, you're invited into my house
Entering the back of my house, welcoming you into my house
Come in to my house, you're invited into my house
Entering the back of my house, welcoming you into my house
I've invited loads to my house, loads of people come to my house
They take stuff inside of my house and smoke stuff outside of my house
Merrymaking, drug taking
At my place, baby, at my place, merrymaking
I've seen them before, lots of people at my front door
Lots of people in my front door trying to get into my house
I've seen them before, lots of people at my front door
Lots of people in my front door trying to get into my house
Merrymaking, drug taking
At my place, baby, at my place
Merrymaking, drug taking
At my place, baby, at my place, merrymaking
We're merrymaking, all the stuff that you've been taking
All the stuff that I've been taking, all the stuff that we've been taking
We're merrymaking, all the stuff that you've been taking
All the stuff that I've been taking, all the stuff that we've been taking
Merrymaking, drug taking
At my place, baby, at my place
Merrymaking, drug taking
At my place, baby, at my place
Merrymaking, drug taking
At my place, baby, at my place
Merrymaking... Drug taking...
Merrymaking, drug taking
At my place, baby, at my place
Merrymaking, drug taking
At my place, baby, at my place
Merrymaking, drug taking
At my place, baby, at my place
Merrymaking, drug taking
At my place, baby, at my place
