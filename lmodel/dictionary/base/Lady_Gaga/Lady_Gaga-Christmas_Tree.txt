Ra pa pam pam
Ra pa pam pam 
Ra pa pam pam 
Ra pa pam pam 
Light me up with me on top lets falalalalalalala
Light me up with me on top lets falalalalalalala
The only place you wanna be is underneath my Christmas tree
The only place you wanna be is underneath my Christmas tree
Light me up with me on top lets falalalalalalala
Light me up with me on top lets falalalalalalala
Ho ho ho under the mistletoe (Ra pa pam pam)
Yes everybody knows (Ra pa pam pam)
We will take off our clothes (Ra pa pam pam)
Yes if you want us to we will
You oh oh oh Christmas
My Christmas tree is delicious
You oh oh oh Christmas
My Christmas tree is delicious
Light me up with you on top lets falalalala (lets go)
Light me up with you on top lets falalalala (lets go)
Ho ho ho under the mistletoe (Ra pa pam pam)
Yes everybody knows (Ra pa pam pam)
We will take off our clothes (Ra pa pam pam)
Yes if you want us to we will
You oh oh oh Christmas
My Christmas tree is delicious
You oh oh oh Christmas
My Christmas tree is delicious
Here here here (Ra pa pam pam)
The best time of the year (Ra pa pam pam)
Take off my ...
Yes if you want us to we will
You oh oh oh Christmas
My Christmas tree is delicious
You oh oh oh Christmas
My Christmas tree is delicious
Space Cowboy Lady Gaga Lady Gaga
And she goes
Space Cowboy Lady Gaga Lady Gaga
Here we go
Cherry cherry boom boom
