The fashion of his, loving him
The fashion of his, loving him
The fashion of his, loving him
The fashion of his, loving him
The fashion of his, loving him
The fashion of his, loving him
The fashion of his, loving him
The fashion of his, loving him
The fashion of his, loving him
The fashion of his, loving him
Love
I never was the kind of girl,
That's naturally sure 
When it comes to love, oh no.
I was insecure, insecure.
But when it comes to you and me, 
I can't deny this 
Feeling inside, oh no!
I never felt like this before
This before, no, no, no.
(Oh) I'm seeing all the signs from above.
(Oh) I'm gonna be the one that he loves,
I was made for loving him.
The fashion of his love.
Oh yeah!
(Oh) I'm gonna be his first and last kiss.
(Oh) 'Cause baby I was born to be his. 
I was made for loving him.
The fashion of his love.
(Made for you)
You know that I'd never cheat on a man.
'Cause I'm not like that.
I'm physically crafted to be
As fitting as McQueen. 
But when it comes to clothing I'm bad,
I'm fashionably just designed to grand,
Oh and he's, no accessory to me,
-ry to me, no, no, no.
(Oh) I'm seeing all the signs from above.
(Oh) I'm gonna be the one that he loves,
I was made for loving him.
The fashion of his love.
Oh yeah!
(Oh) I'm gonna be his first and last kiss.
(Oh) 'Cause baby I was born to be his. 
I was made for loving him.
The fashion of his love.
(Made for you)
They say I need a strong man,
Not just a friend,
But baby my search is done.
No longer reason to cry or to justify,
How I feel for you, my love.
I'm seeing all the signs from above.
I'm gonna be the one that he loves,
I was made for loving him, oh yeah!
(Oh) I'm seeing all the signs from above.
(Oh) I'm gonna be the one that he loves,
I was made for loving him.
The fashion of his love.
Oh yeah!
(Oh) I'm gonna be his first and last kiss.
(Oh) 'Cause baby I was born to be his. 
I was made for loving him.
The fashion of his love.
(Made for you)
