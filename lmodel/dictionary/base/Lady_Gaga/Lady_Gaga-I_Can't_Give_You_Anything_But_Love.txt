<song artist="Lady_Gaga" title="I_Can't_Give_You_Anything_But_Love">
Lady Gaga:
I can't give you anything but love, baby
That's the only thing I've plenty of, baby
Dream a while scheme a while
You're sure to find happiness and I guess
All those things you've always pined for
Gee, I'd like to see you looking swell, Tony
With diamond watches Tiffany's just
Don't sell, baby, till that lucky day
You know darn well
Oh, I can't give you anything but love
Tony Bennett:
I can't give you anything but love, lady
That's the only thing I've plenty of, lady
Dream a while scheme a while
You're sure to find happiness and I guess
All those things you've always pined for
How'd you like to see me looking swell, Lady
Diamond bracelets Woolworth doesn't sell, Gaga
Both:
Till that lucky day, you know darn well, baby
Lady Gaga:
Oh, I can't give you anything
Tony Bennett:
I don't want just anything
Both:
Oh, I can't give you anything but love
