<song artist="Lady_Gaga" title="Fashion_Of_His_Love">
I never was the kind of girl,
That's naturally sure when it comes to love, oh no!
I was insecure, insecure.
But when it comes to you and me, 
I can't deny this feeling inside, oh no!
I never felt like this before, this before.
No, no, no.
(Ohhhh)
I've seen all the signs from above.
(Ohhhh)
I'm gonna be the one that he loves,
I was made for loving him.
The fashion of his love.
Oh yeah!
(Ohhhh)
I'm gonna be his first and last kiss.
(Ohh​hh)
'Cause honey I was born to be his. 
I was made for loving him.
The fashion of his love.
You know that I'd never cheat on a man.
'Cause I'm not like that.
I'm physically crafted to be
As fitting as McQueen. 
But when it comes to clothing, I'm bad.
I'm fashionably just designed to be rather in his.
No accessory to me, right to me
No, no, no.
No, I just can't seem to forget you
No I can't for just as long as I met you.
You're my babe, right through.
I was made for you (made for you).
(Ohhhh)
I've seen all the signs from above.
(Ohhhh)
I'm gonna be the one that he loves,
I was made for loving him.
The fashion of his love.
Oh yeah!
(Ohhhh)
I'm gonna be his first and last kiss.
(Ohh​hh)
'Cause honey I was born to be his. 
I was made for loving him.
The fashion of his love.
They say I need a strong man, not just a friend
But baby, my search is done.
No longer reason to cry or to justify
How I feel for you, my love.
I've seen all the signs from above,
I'm gonna be the one that he loves,
I was made for loving him.
Oh yeaah!
(Ohhhh)
I've seen all the signs from above.
(Ohhhh)
I'm gonna be the one that he loves,
I was made for loving him.
The fashion of his love.
Oh yeah!
(Ohhhh)
I'm gonna be his first and last kiss.
(Ohh​hh)
'Cause honey I was born to be his. 
I was made for loving him.
The fashion of his love.
(Ohhhh)
I'm gonna be his first and last kiss.
(Ohh​hh)
'Cause honey I was born to be his. 
I was made for loving him.
The fashion of his love.
