<song artist="Lady_Gaga" title="Dirty_Rich">
Beautiful, dirty, dirty, rich, rich, dirty, dirty
Beautiful, dirty, rich
Dirty, dirty, rich, dirty, dirty, rich, beautiful
Beautiful and dirty, dirty, rich, rich, dirty
We got a red light
Pornographic dance fight
Systematic, honey
But we go no money
Our hair is perfect
While were all getting shit wrecked
It's automatic, honey
But we got no money
Daddy, I'm so sorry
I'm so s-s-sorry, yeah
We just like to party
Like to p-p-party, yeah
Bang, bang
We're beautiful and dirty rich
(Dirty, dirty, rich, dirty, dirty, rich, beautiful)
Bang, bang
We're beautiful and dirty rich
(Beautiful, dirty, dirty, rich, rich, bang, bang)
We live a cute life
Sound fematic, pants tight
Tug 'n' plastic, honey
But we got no money
We do the dance right
We've got it made like
Ice cream topped with honey
But we got no money
Daddy, I'm so sorry
I'm so s-s-sorry, yeah
We just like to party
Like to p-p-party, yeah
Bang, bang
We're beautiful and dirty rich
(Dirty, dirty, rich, dirty, dirty, rich, beautiful)
Bang, bang
We're beautiful and dirty rich
(Beautiful, dirty, dirty, rich, rich, bang, bang)
A bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang
Beautiful, dirty rich
A bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang
Beautiful, dirty rich
Bang, bang
We're beautiful and dirty rich
(Dirty, dirty, rich, dirty, dirty, rich, beautiful)
Bang, bang
We're beautiful and dirty rich
(Beautiful, dirty, dirty, rich, rich, bang, bang)
Bang, bang
(Dirty, dirty, rich, dirty, dirty, rich, beautiful)
Bang, bang
(Beautiful, dirty, dirty, rich, rich, bang, bang)
