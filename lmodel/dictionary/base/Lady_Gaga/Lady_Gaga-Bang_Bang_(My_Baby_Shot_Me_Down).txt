<song artist="Lady_Gaga" title="Bang_Bang_(My_Baby_Shot_Me_Down)">
I was five and he was six
We rode on horses made of sticks
He wore black and I wore white
He would always win the fight
Bang bang, he shot me down
Bang bang, I hit the ground
Bang bang, that awful sound
Bang bang, my baby shot me down
Seasons came and changed the time
When I grew up I called him mine
He would always laugh and say
Remember when we used to play
Bang bang, I shot you down
Bang bang, i hit the ground
Bang bang, that awful sound
Bang bang, I used to shoot you down
Music played and people sang
Not for me no church bells rang
Now he's gone I don't know why
Until this day, sometimes I cry
He didn't even say goodbye
He didn't take the time to lie
Bang bang, I shot me down
Bang bang, He hit the ground
Bang bang, that awful sound
Bang bang, my baby shot me down
