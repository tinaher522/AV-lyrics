<song artist="Lady_Gaga" title="Hair">
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, woah
 
Whenever I'm dressed cool, 
My parents put up a fight. 
(Uh huh, uh huh)
And if I'm hot shot,
Mom will cut my hair at night. 
(Uh huh, uh huh)
And in the morning, 
I'm short of my identity. 
(Uh huh, uh huh)
I scream Mom and Dad, 
Why can't I be who I wanna be? 
(Uh huh, uh huh) to be.
I just wanna be myself,
And I want you to love me for who I am. 
I just wanna be myself,
And I want you to know, I am my hair.
I've had enough, this is my prayer,
That I'll die living just as free as my hair.
I've had enough, this is my prayer,
That I'll die living just as free as my hair.
I've had enough, I'm not a freak,
I'm just here fighting to stay cool on the streets
I've had enough, enough, enough,
And this is my prayer, I swear,
I'm as free as my hair.
I'm as free as my hair.
I am my hair.
I am my hair.
As free as my hair, hair, hair, 
Hair, hair, ha-ha-ha-hair,
Hair, hair, hair, 
Hair, hair, ha-ha-ha-hair.
As free as my hair, hair, hair, 
Hair, hair, ha-ha-ha-hair
Hair, hair, hair, 
Hair, hair, ha-ha-ha-hair.
Sometimes I want some
Racoon or red highlights.
(Uh huh, uh huh)
Just because I want my friends,
To think I'm dynamite.
(Uh huh, uh huh)
And on Friday rocks in,
High school dance.
(Uh huh, uh huh)
I got my bangs too hot,
That I don't stand a chance.
(Uh huh, uh huh) a chance.
I just wanna be myself,
And I want you to love me for who I am. 
I just wanna be myself,
And I want you to know, I am my hair.
I've had enough, this is my prayer,
That I'll die living just as free as my hair.
I've had enough, this is my prayer,
That I'll die living just as free as my hair.
I've had enough, I'm not a freak,
I'm just here fighting to stay cool on the streets
I've had enough, enough, enough,
And this is my prayer, I swear,
I'm as free as my hair.
I'm as free as my hair.
I am my hair.
I am my hair.
As free as my hair, hair, hair, 
Hair, hair, ha-ha-ha-hair,
Hair, hair, hair, 
Hair, hair, ha-ha-ha-hair.
As free as my hair, hair, hair, 
Hair, hair, ha-ha-ha-hair
Hair, hair, hair, 
Hair, hair, ha-ha-ha-hair.
Ha-ha-ha-hair.
I just want to be free, I just want to be me
And I want lots of friends who invite me to their parties.
I don't wanna change, and I don't wanna be ashamed.
I'm the spirit of my Hair, it's all the glory that I bare.
I am my hair, I am my hair
I'm my hair, I am my hair
I am my hair, I am my hair
I am my hair, I am my hair
(It's all the glory that I bare)
I am my hair, I am my hair
It's all the glory that I bare
I am my hair, I am my hair
I'm my hair, yeah, yeah
(All the glory that I bare)
I'm my hair, yeah, yeah
(All the glory that I bare)
I'm my hair, yeah, yeah
(All the glory that I bare)
I'm my hair, yeah, yeah, yeah
I've had enough, this is my prayer,
That I'll die living just as free as my hair.
I've had enough, this is my prayer,
That I'll die living just as free as my hair.
I've had enough, I'm not a freak,
I'm just here fighting to stay cool on the streets
I've had enough, enough, enough,
And this is my prayer, I swear,
I'm as free as my hair.
I'm as free as my hair.
I am my hair.
I am my hair.
Ooh, my hair, my hair.
