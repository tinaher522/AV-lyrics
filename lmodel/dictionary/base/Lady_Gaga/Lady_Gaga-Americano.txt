<song artist="Lady_Gaga" title="Americano">
I met a girl in east L.A.
In floral shorts as sweet as May
She sang in eights in two Barrio chords
We fell in love
But not in court
La la la la la la 
La la la la la la
La la la la la la
La la la la la la
La la la la la la
La la la la la la
I don’t S
I don’t S
Ahhhhh
Americaaaa, Americanoooo
Ahhhhh
Americaaaa, Americanoooo
Mis canciones son de la revolución
Mi corazón me duele por mi generación
If you love me
We can marry
On the west coast
On a Wednesday
En un verano
En agosto
I don't speak your
I don't speak your
Languagono
I don't speak your
(Won't speak your)
I won't speak your
(Won't speak your)
Jesus Christo 
La la la la la la
Ahhhhh
Americaaaa, Americanoooo
Ahhhhh
Americaaaa, Americanoooo
I will fight for
I have fought for
How I love you
(La la la la la la)
I have cried for
I will die for
How I care
(La la la la la la)
In the mountains
Las campanas estan sonando
(La la la la la la)
Todos los chicos, (Chicas)
Y los chicos, (Chicas)
se estan besando 
(La la la la la la)
I don't speak your
I don't speak your
Languagono
I don't speak your
I won't speak your
Jesus Christo
I don't speak your
(Won't speak your)
I don't speak your
(Won't speak your)
Americano
I don't speak your
(Won't speak your)
I won't speak your
(Won't speak your)
Jesus Christo 
Ahhhhh
Americaaaa, Americanoooo
Ahhhhh
Americaaaa, Americanoooo
Ahhhhh
Americaaaa, Americanoooo
Ahhhhh
Americaaaa, Americanoooo
Don't you try and catch me
Don't you try and catch me
No no no no 
I'm Living on the edge of
Living on the edge of the
Law law law law 
Don't you try and catch me
Don't you try and get me
No no no no 
Don't you try to catch me
I'm Living on the edge of
Law, law, law, law
