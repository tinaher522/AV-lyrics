<song artist="Lady_Gaga" title="Dance_In_The_Dark">
(D-d-d d-d) uh, (D-d-d d-d) ah
(D-d-d d-d) yeah, (D-d-d d-d) ah
Uh-ha, ha (D-d)
 
(D-d-d d-d) (D-d-d d-d)
(D-d-d d-d) (Make it stop!)
Silicone, saline
Poison, inject me, baby
I'm a free bitch.
I'm a free bitch.
Some girls won't dance,
To the beat of the track.
She won't walk away, 
But she won't look back.
She looks good but
Her boyfriend says she's a mess.
She's a mess, she's a mess,
Now, the girl is stressed.
She's a mess, she's a mess,
She's a mess, she's a mess.
(Kills, kills, the, the, the, the)
(Tell 'em- how you feel girls)
Baby loves to dance in the dark
'Cause when he's looking she falls apart
Baby loves to dance in the dark
(Dance, dance, dance, dance)
(Tell 'em- how you feel girls)
Baby loves to dance in the dark
'Cause when he's looking she falls apart
Baby loves to dance,
Loves to dance in the dark
(Dance, dance, dance, dance)
(Dance, dance, d-d-d, saline)
Run, run, her kiss,
Is a vampire grin.
The Moon lights her way,
While she's howling at him.
(Howling at him, howling at him)
(Ru-ru-ru ru-ru-ru ru-ru-ru)
She looks good but
Her boyfriend says she's a tramp.
She's a tramp, she's a vamp,
But she still does her dance.
She's a tramp, she's a vamp,
But she still kills the dance.
(Kills, kills, the, the, the, the)
(Tell 'em- how you feel girls)
Baby loves to dance in the dark
'Cause when he's looking she falls apart
Baby loves to dance in the dark
(Dance, dance, dance, dance)
(Tell 'em- how you feel girls)
Baby loves to dance in the dark
'Cause when he's looking she falls apart
Baby loves to dance,
Loves to dance in the dark.
(Dance, dance, dance, dance)
(The dark, the dark)
In the dark, she loves to dance in the dark. (dance, dance)
In the dark, she loves, she loves to dance in the dark.
(Dance, dance, dance, d-d-d-d-d-dance)
Marilyn, Judy, S-S-S-S-Sylvia, (-vio)
Tell 'em how you feel, girls.
Work your blonde Ben√©t Ramsey,
We'll haunt like liberace.
Find your freedom in the music,
Find your Jesus, find your Kubrick.
You will never fall apart,
Diana, you're still in our hearts. (Girls)
(T-t-tell 'em, girls)
Never let you fall apart,
Together we'll dance in the dark.
Baby loves to dance in the dark,
'Cause when he's looking she falls apart.
Baby loves to dance in the dark.
Baby, yeah.
(Dance, dance, dance, dance)
Baby loves to dance in the dark,
'Cause when he's looking she falls apart.
Baby loves to dance,
Loves to dance in the dark.
(Dance, dance, dance, dance)
In the dark
