<song artist="Lady_Gaga" title="Highway_Unicorn_(Road_To_Love)">
We can be strong, we can be strong
Out on this lonely run, down the road to love.
We can be strong, we can be strong
Follow that unicorn on the road to love.
Run run with her t-
Run run with her t-
Run run with her t-
Run run with her t-
Run run with her t-
Run run with her t-
Run run with her t-
Run run with her t-
Run run with her top down, baby she flies.
Run run with the fury of a saint in her eyes.
Run run ha cha cha cha baby she goes
With blonde hair and a gun smokin' under her toes.
Whoah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh,
Whoah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh.
Ride ride pony ride ride.
Whoah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh,
Whoah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh.
Ride ride pony tonight.
We can be strong, we can be strong
Out on this lonely run, down the road to love.
We can be strong, we can be strong
Follow that unicorn on the road to love.
I'm on the road (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh), 
I'm on the road to love.
I'm on the road (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh), 
I'm on the road to love.
She's just an American riding a dream
And she got a rainbow syrup in her heart that she bleeds.
She don't care if your papers or your love is the law
She's a free soul, burning roads with a flag in her bra.
Whoah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh,
Whoah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh.
Ride ride pony ride ride.
Whoah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh,
Whoah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh.
Ride ride pony tonight.
We can be strong, we can be strong
Out on this lonely run, down the road to love.
We can be strong, we can be strong
Follow that unicorn on the road to love.
I'm on the road (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh), 
I'm on the road to love.
I'm on the road (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh), 
I'm on the road to love.
Get your hot rods ready to rumble, 'cause we're gonna fall in love tonight.
Get your hot rods ready to rumble, 'cause we're gonna drink until we die.
Get your hot rods ready to rumble, 'cause we're gonna fall in love tonight.
Get your hot rods ready to rumble, 'cause we're gonna drink until we die.
(Die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, 
Die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die)
