<song artist="Lady_Gaga" title="Partynauseous">
Hands up
I, I want to come and make peace with you
but they won't let me, no, they won't let me through
I don't mind if they a-arrest me
'cause I'm wearing my Versace
Why can't we just, put on a smile
and a buzz buzz buzz buzz
We all might be sick
Whether it's at first or after a few drinks
we're gonna unite, don't they?
We're currently set from the East
I'm from Jakarta-a-a
We PARTYNAUSEOUS 'cause I seem to problem with ya
We're currently set from the West
My name is Lady Gaga
We PARTYNAUSEOUS 'cause I seem to problem with ya
Nod, if you wanna be high with the enemy
It's a test and you better do your best 
Nod, if you wanna make love with the enemy
go and [?]
Now jump!
In a way exhausting
with problem solving
Drink 'till she's attractive 
We're PARTYNAUSEOUS
coming from diplomatic [?]
Making that peace attractive
we're PARTYNAUSEOUS
