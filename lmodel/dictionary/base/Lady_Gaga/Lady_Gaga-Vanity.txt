<song artist="Lady_Gaga" title="Vanity">
Midnight at the glamour show on a Sunday Night
Everybody drink a lotta whiskey and wine
We dance like no tomorrow
We're on Burlesque time
But everybody's gotta work tomorrow at nine
Touch me, t-touch me baby but don't mess up my hair
Love me, l-love me crazy
But don't get too attached, 'cause it's a brief affair
Vanity (pictures in magazines, movie screens)
Vanity (mirrors and cameras, so many beauty queens)
Vanity (it's so good to be)
Fabulous and glamourous, we love ourselves and no one else
Va-va-va-va-vanity va-vanity, va-va-va-vanity
Nothin' wrong with being just a little bit vain
We need a little pretty cuz this country's insane
So go ahead and label me whatever you like
But nothing's quite as sexy as a woman is fine
Touch me, t-touch me baby but don't mess up my hair
Love me, l-love me crazy
But don't get too attached, this is a brief affair
Vanity (pictures in magazines, movie screens)
Vanity (mirrors and cameras, so many beauty queens)
Vanity (it's so good to be)
Fabulous and glamorous, we love ourselves and no one else
Look at me (watcha lookin' at)
Look at me (watcha starin' at)
Look at me (watcha lookin' at)
Look at me (watcha starin'at)
I'm comin' around, I'm sippin on Andre, it's time
I heard the cutie's in the back, starting the p-party line
Let's dance (be proud) we're in the vanity house
We're covered in sequins, diamonds, we're happy cuz we're shinin
Touch me, t-touch me baby, but don't mess up my hair
Love me, l-love me crazy
But don't get too attached, this is a brief affair
Vanity (pictures in magazines, movie screens)
Vanity (mirrors and cameras, so many beauty queens)
Vanity (it's so good to be)
Fabulous and glamourous, we love ourselves and no one else
Vanity (pictures in magazines, movie screens)
Vanity (mirrors and cameras, so many beauty queens)
Vanity (it's so good to be)
Fabulous and glamourous, we love ourselves and no one else
