<song artist="Lady_Gaga" title="Nothing_I_Can_Say_(Eh_Eh)">
Cherry, cherry, boom, boom, ga, ga
Boy, we've had a real good time
And I wish you the best on your way
I didn't mean to hurt you
I never thought we'd fall out of place
I had something that I love long, long
But my friends keepa' tellin' me
That some thing's wrong
Then I met someone
And eh, there's nothing else I can say
There's nothing else I can say
I wish he never looked at me that way
There's nothing else I can say
Not that I don't care about you
Just that things got so complique
I met somebody cute and bonny
Got each other and that's funny
I had something that I love long, long
But my friends keepa' tellin' me
That something's wrong
Then I met someone
And eh, there's nothing else I can say
There's nothing else I can say
I wish he never looked at me that way
There's nothing else I can say
I had something that I love long, long
But my friends keepa' tellin' me
That some thing's wrong
Then I met someone
And eh, there's nothing else I can say
There's nothing else I can say
Wish you never looked at me that way
There's nothing else I can say
Wish you never looked at me that way
There's nothing else I can say
Cherry, cherry, boom, boom
All I can say is eh, eh
