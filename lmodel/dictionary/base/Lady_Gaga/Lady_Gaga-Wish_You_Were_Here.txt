<song artist="Lady_Gaga" title="Wish_You_Were_Here">
It's funny how things they change
The clouds they part, rearrange - for me
Faces of strangers and I have no familiars to help me see
Where is home?
I want you to know
That I wish you were here
I wish you were here
Sometimes I wonder
If God hides out in cities to set us free
'Cause yeah, this room is crowded but I'm so alone
And it help me please
Where is home?
I want you to know
That I wish you were here
I wish you were here
I wish you were here
And I will be strong
I won't give in
I won't deny you
I know where we've been
I was so much more
Then all of my fears
Then all of these tears, my tears (yeah)
I wish you were here
I wish you were here
Where is home?
I want you to know (oh yeah)
I wish you were here
I wish you were here
I wish you were here
