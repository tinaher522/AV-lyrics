<song artist="Lady_Gaga" title="Dope">
Cork's off, it's on
The party's just begun
I promise this drink is my last one
I know I fucked up again
'Cause I lost my only friend
God forgive my sins
Don't leave me, I
I'd hate myself until I die
My heart would break without you
Might not awake without you
Been hurting low from living high for so long
I'm sorry and I love you
Stay with me Bell Bottom Blue
I'll keep on searchin' for an answer
'Cause I need you more than dope
I need you more than dope
Need you more than dope
I need you more than dope
I need you more than dope
Toast one last puff
And two last regrets
Three spirits and twelve lonely steps
Up heaven's stairway to gold
Mine myself like coal
A mountain of a soul
Each day I cry
I feel so low from living high
My heart would break without you
Might not awake without you
Been hurting low from living high for so long
I'm sorry and I love you
Stay with me Bell Bottom Blue
I'll keep on searchin' for an answer
'Cause I need you more than dope
I need you more than dope
I need you more than dope
I need you more than dope
I need you more than dope
I need you more...
Need you more...
I need you more than dope.
