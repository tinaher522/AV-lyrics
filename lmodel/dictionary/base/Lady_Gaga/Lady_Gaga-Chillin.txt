My Name WALE and I came to Get It
Came to Get it, Came to Get It
My Name Wale 
SHIIIT This how you start of 09
Kickin in the door, and I'm everybody Problem
Stuntin in some other Jordan Nines
I got Phil knight talkin about "How you got Them? "
Let's talk about the cars ya'll got
You say you got alotta whips, well I got A Lot
I got the right to be cocky
Get so much cut disc jockeys jock me...
You Niggas mad cause you not me
I remain a GIANT while your Jeremy Shockey
And if You ain't Heard Me Properly
If You Speak Garbage, then we no Capice
DC Chillin, PG Chillin, Floor To the Ceilin
Stuntin in my Billion-Air, Gear On My
Millionaire Frames, that's money on my mind, WALE 
Lady GaGa
Get Em All, Get Em All, Pick it All Up
Stack Up Your Funds Like a Million Bucks
Across That Pond, They All Know Us
International... Whoaaaa!
Driving My Car To A Foreign Place
Lookin at me, Now They Know My Face
We Want It All Now, We Got All Yesss
Look At That, Look At How They Lookin At Usss 
Wale
Yea, They Keep Sayin Where I'm From, My Name Wale
Ho's Call Me "Mr. Never Wear The Same Thing"
You Redundant, You Never Ever Change
And I'm The Same Way, M.I.A.
That Mean Cool And Dre Get High Like Planes
Your Man Wale In His Own Damn Lane
Can't Control the box, you are no Mills Lane
Ain't heard DC since Sardines came
Ha! And I Made Ya'll Love it
We Don't Cop Plea's, But Ya'll Don't Cop Nuffin
Police Come Around Don't nobody say nuffin
And you be with the cops, you niggas is McLovin
Dark liquor til we busted
Til' I got a buzz like that nigga Chris Mullen
District Of Columbia
You Bernie Mac Funny, We Ain't scared of None of Ya! 
Lady GaGa
Get Em All, Get Em All, Pick it All Up
Stack Up Your Funds Like a Million Bucks

We Want It All Now, We Got All Yesss
Look At That, Look At How They Lookin At Usss

My Name WALE and I came to Get It

My Name Wale 
Dre, Pick 'em, ah, Pick'em, I'll shut Them All Down
Haters in the crowd, if you see 'em point them out
Stacks in my jeans, broads on the scene
Folarin be ballin for all ya'll to see
Ain't I something? The Way I'm Stuntin
My Material Girls give 'em A-Rod Moneyyy!
LV on my Luggage
Them Bammas Goin Hate, and I love it, Fuck 'Em 
Lady GaGa
Look at, Lookin At, Lookin at me

Look At That, Look How they Lookin At Me
