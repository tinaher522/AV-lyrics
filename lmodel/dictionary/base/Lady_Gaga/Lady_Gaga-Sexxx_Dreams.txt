[Verse 1]
Last night, Our lovers' quarrel (I was thinkin about you)
Hurts more than I can say (And it was, kinda dirty)
All night (and the way you looked at me)
Help me, Help (It was kinda nasty)
Help me, Help (It was kinda trashy)
Cause I can’t help my mind from going there
[Pre-Chorus]
Heard your boyfriend was away this weekend
Wanna meet at my place?
Heard that we both got nothing to do
And I lay in bed I touch myself and I thinka you
[Chorus 1]
Last night
Damn, you were in my Sexxx Dreams (you were in my)
Doin really nasty things (you were in my dreams)
Damn, you were in my Sexxx Dreams (you were in my)
Makin love in my Sexxx Dreams
[Verse 2]
We could be caught (I just want this to be perfect)
We’re both convicted criminals of thought (cause I’m broken)
Let’s white glove the bed (by the one before)
(He was kinda nasty)
Help me, Help
(And feels so trashy)
Cause we can’t hide the evidence in our hands
[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus 2]
Last night
Damn, you were in my Sexxx Dreams (you were in my)
Doin really nasty things (you were in my dreams)
Damn, you were in my Sexxx Dreams (you were in my)
Makin love in my Sexxx Dreams
Don’t stop the party (Making love in our Sexxx Dreams)
Let’s keep it naughty (Makin love in my Sexxx Dreams)
Watch me under you (Makin love in my Sexxx Dreams)
Tomorrow when I run into you, Tomorrow when I run into you
[Bridge]
You could turn a stone
or the color of a man petrified by a woman
in love as I am when I lay with you
I thinka him, I thinka him
I can’t believe I’m telling you this, but I’ve had a couple drinks and oh my god
[Chorus 3]
Last night
Damn, you were in my Sexxx Dreams (you were in my)
Doin really nasty things (you were in dreams)
Damn, you were in my Sexxx Dreams (you were in my)
Last night (Don’t stop the party)
Damn, you were in my Sexxx Dreams (Let’s keep it naughty)
Doin really nasty things (Watch me under you)
Damn, you were in my Sexxx Dreams (Tomorrow when I run into you)
Makin love in my Sexxx Dreams
