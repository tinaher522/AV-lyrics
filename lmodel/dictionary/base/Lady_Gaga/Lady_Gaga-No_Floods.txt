<song artist="Lady_Gaga" title="No_Floods">
I never ever thought I'd live away
From everyone that I love and say goodbye
Now I'm the princess of a downtown train
Where everybody here, they know my game
But when I walk down the street I hear them say
"There she goes, that crazy girl
She thinks she's something in this world"
So I'mma close my ears and dream
'Cause life is never really what it seems
In every mystery there's a truth
You know I'm tellin' I'm tellin' you
No matter lightning or thunder,
Buckets of rainwater
You can't flood this town
In a world unknown
You've gotta hold your own
And you can't stop me
You're never ever ever gonna stop me now
On every street there is a memory
A time and place we can never be again
Street lights glow red, green and yellow too
Do you let signs tell you what to do?
Yeah, when you say stop
Be sure that I'll say go
To the stars and the land
Fire can't burn this hands
But I'll just close my eyes and dream
You can't deny me my astronomy
Ehi
In every mistery there's a truth
You know I'm telling, I'm telling you
No matter lightning or thunder,
Buckets of rainwater
You can't flood this town
In a world unknown
You've gotta hold your own
And you can't stop me
You're never ever ever gonna stop me now

Go ahead and don't believe
'Cause everyone needs a way to breath
And love and dream
And you can't stop me
Can't stop me
No matter lightning or thunder,
Buckets of rainwater
You can't flood this town
In a world unknown
You've gotta hold your own
And you can't stop me
You're never ever ever gonna stop 
No matter lightning or thunder,
Buckets of rainwater
You can't flood this town 
In a world unknown
You've gotta hold your own
