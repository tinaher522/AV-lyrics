(Black, black, black)
(Black, black, black)
(Black, black, black)
(Jesus is the new black)
(Jesus is the new black)
(Jesus is the new black)
(Jesus is the new black, aow)
I grew up in New York City
Since I was born on Broadway, baby
Moved downtown when I was just nineteen
To start a new life on the New York scene
There's no way I could be stop
Was taken my best shot
I had a better plan
There's no way I could be stop
Was coming for your spot
I met a better man
Amen, on the runway 
Dressed in its best
Amen fashion, on the runway
Work it Black Jesus
Amen, on the runway 
Dressed in its best
Amen fashion, on the runway
Work it Black Jesus
Dancing in my revelation
On a ground pop civilization
Concrete poetry to feed my mind
Old symbolism was left behind
There's no way I could be stop
Was taken my best shot
I had a better plan
There no way I could be stop
Was coming for your spot
I met a better man
Amen, on the runway 
Dressed in its best
Amen fashion, on the runway
Work it Black Jesus
Amen, on the runway 
Dressed in its best
Amen fashion, on the runway
Work it Black Jesus
Put in on
A-amen fashion
Celebrate, uh uh
A new compassion
Put it on
Amen fashion
Celebrate, uh uh
Style your passion
Put in on
A-amen Fashion
Celebrate, uh uh
A new compassion
Put it on
Amen Fashion
Celebrate, uh uh
Wear out your vision
Black Jesus
Black Jesus
Black Jesus
Jesus is the new black, aow!!
Amen, on the runway 
Dressed in its best
Amen fashion, on the runway
Work it Black Jesus
Amen on the runway 
Dressed in its best
Amen fashion, on the runway
Work it Black Jesus.
Amen, on the runway 
Dressed in its best
Amen fashion, on the runway
Work it Black Jesus
Amen on the runway 
Dressed in its best
Amen fashion, on the runway
Work it Black Jesus
