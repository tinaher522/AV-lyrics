<song artist="Lady_Gaga" title="Ratchet">
Manicure slick
Cheap lipstick
Runnin' outta control
Sexy slutty chick
Walking in New York City
Long ass heels
And she runs runs runs runs
Like A RATCHET GIRL
You won't fool me again with your teathre
You won't fool me again ratchet girl
RATCHET, RATCHET, RATCHET
Leopard bitch walking to his heart
Like a wolve, like a wolve
She's faster than the rays of sun
RATCHET, RATCHET, RATCHET
Fake svarosky rings
She used all her dollar bills
To snatch all the weaves
She calls herself RATCHET
But she's just a flatter
Cucci cucci bag
Fake versace dress
thinks she's a hollywood star
And she runs runs runs runs
Like A RATCHET GIRL
You won't fool me again with your teathre
You won't fool me again ratchet girl
RATCHET, RATCHET, RATCHET
Leopard bitch walking to his heart
Like a wolve, like a wolve
She's faster than the rays of sun
RATCHET, RATCHET, RATCHET
Hoola hoola hop
Ratchet girl
Don't be stressed
Nobody loves you
Nobody needs you
Everybody hates you
Oh yeah
Hug your fake Loubotins
Kiss the diamond rolex ass
Fuck your stupid Cucci bag
Boom Boom Boom Pow
Yeah, you, ratchet girl
Imma kill yourself
With a lipstick gun
Glitter knife
While your boyfriend
Is on the stripper club
Getting high as fuck
Putting dollars
On that hoe ass
On that hoe ass
You won't fool me again with your teathre
You won't fool me again ratchet girl
RATCHET, RATCHET, RATCHET
Leopard bitch walking to his heart
Like a wolve, like a wolve
She's faster than the rays of sun
RATCHET, RATCHET, RATCHET
You won't fool me again with your teathre
You won't fool me again ratchet girl
RATCHET, RATCHET, RATCHET
Leopard bitch walking to his heart
Like a wolve, like a wolve
She's faster than the rays of sun
RATCHET, RATCHET, RATCHET
Ratchet go far away
Fashion police is coming for your fake weave
They will beat you harder than me
Go away Take the taxi
Sell your rings
Catch a trip
GO away bitch
