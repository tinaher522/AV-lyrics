(Ohhh ohhh La la la)
I am, I'm too fabulous
I'm so fierce that it's so nuts
I live to be model thin
Dress me, I'm your mannequin
J'adore Vivienne, habillez-moi,
Gucci, Fendi, et Prada.
Valentino, Armani too.
Merde I love them Jimmy Choo
Fashion put it all on me
Don't you wanna see these clothes on me
Fashion put it all on me
I am anyone you want me to be
Fashion put it all on me
Don't you wanna see these clothes on me
Fashion put it all on me
I am anyone you want me to be
(Ohhhh ohhhhh La la la
We love designer)
I need, some new stilettos
Can't walk down the street in those
You are who you wear it's true
A girl's just as hot as
The shoes she chooses
J'adore Weitzman habillez-moi,
Louis, Dolce Gabbana,
Alexander McQueen, eh oh,
Merde I love those Manolo
Fashion put it all on me
Don't you wanna see these clothes on me
Fashion put it all on me
I am anyone you want me to be
Fashion put it all on me
Don't you wanna see these clothes on me
Fashion put it all on me
I am anyone you want me to be
(Ohhhh ohhhhh La la la
We love designer)
(Ohhhh ohhhhh La la la
We love designer)
Fashion put it all on me
Don't you wanna see these clothes on me
Fashion put it all on me
I am anyone you want me to be
Fashion put it all on me
Don't you wanna see these clothes on me
Fashion put it all on me
I am anyone you want me to be
Fashion put it all on me
Don't you wanna see these clothes on me
Fashion put it all on me
I am anyone you want me to be
Fashion put it all on me
Don't you wanna see these clothes on me
Fashion put it all on me
I am anyone you want me to be
