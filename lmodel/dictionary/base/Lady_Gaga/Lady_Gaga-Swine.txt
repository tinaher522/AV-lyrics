<song artist="Lady_Gaga" title="Swine">
Hush up
Don't speak, don't wanna hear another
(not another word from you)
You're just an ani-
-mal trying to act real special
(but deep down you are just a shrew)
Maybe I should have a little more just to stay out of my mind
Cause it's when I'm not thinking with you that I act like a swine
Act like a swine
Act like a swine
I know, I know, I know, I know you want me
You're just a pig inside a human body
Squealer, squealer, squeal out, you're so disgusting
You're just a pig inside
Do ya? I know, I know, I know you want me
You're just a pig inside a human body
Squealer, squealer, squeal out, you're so disgusting
You're just a pig inside
Swine
Swine
Swine
Swine
SWINE!
SWINE!
Be that, hog sweat it you
You squealer
(Let your body jiggle)
Slap her skin-he
Love to watch her ass go wiggle
(It's the feel of ecstacy)
Maybe I should have a little more just to stay out of my mind
Cause it's when I'm not thinking with you that I act like a swine
Act like a swine
Act like a swine
I know, I know, I know, I know you want me
You're just a pig inside a human body
Squealer, squealer, squeal out, you're so disgusting
You're just a pig inside
Do you, I know, I know, I know you want me
You're just a pig inside a human body
Squealer, squealer, squeal out, you're so disgusting
You're just a pig inside...swine
Swine
Swine
Swine
Swine
&lt;grunting and squealing&gt;
SWINE!!!
&lt;grunting and squealing&gt;
Paint your face, and
Paint his face and catch the beat
Paint your face, and
Paint her face and catch the beat
Paint your face, and
Be a swine, just catch the beat
Bump the weekend
Catch the beat
Ca-catch the beat
Ca-ca ca-ca-catch the beat
Ca-catch the beat
SWINE!
