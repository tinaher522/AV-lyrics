1, 2, 3
Nowhere, yeah, were goin' nowhere, fast
Maybe this time I'll be yours, you'll be mine
C-c-c-crazy, get your ass in my bed
Baby, you'll be just my summer boyfriend, summer boy
Let's get lost, you can take me home
Somewhere nice we can be alone, bikini top's comin' off
Don't be sad when the sun goes down
You'll wake up and I'm not around, I've got to go, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
We'll still have the summer after all
Sometimes you might start a fight
But I'm happy, pretending we're alright, alright
Sunglasses, cover up my green eyes
My martini glistens, yeah
While checking out other guys, summer boy
Let's get lost, you can take me home
Somewhere nice we can be alone, bikini top's comin' off
Don't be sad when the sun goes down
You'll wake up and I'm not around, I've got to go, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
We'll still have the summer after all
Hey there, summer boy
Let's go for a drive
Take me for a ride
Never gonna close our eyes
Hey there, summer boy
I'm a busy girl
Don't have too much time
Hurry up before I change my mind
Hey there summer boy
I'm taking off my heels
Let's go for a run
Have a little summer fun
Have a little summer fun, summer boy
Let's get lost, you can take me home
Somewhere nice we can be alone, bikini top's droppin' off
Don't be sad when the sun goes down
You'll wake up and I'm not around, I've got to go, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
We'll still have the summer after all
Let's get lost, you can take me home
Somewhere nice we can be alone, I've got my summer, summer boy
Don't be sad when the sun goes down
You'll wake up and I'm not around, I've got my summer, summer boy
And we'll still have the summer after all
I have got my, yes, I've got my
I have got my, summer, summer boy
