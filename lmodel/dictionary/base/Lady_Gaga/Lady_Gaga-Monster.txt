Don't call me Gaga.
I've never seen one like that before.
Haha, Don't look at me like that.
You amaze me.
He ate my heart, he a-a-ate my heart. (You little monster.)
He ate my heart, he a-a-ate my heart out. (You amaze me.)
Ate my heart, he a-a-ate my heart. (Haha, haha.)
He ate my heart, he a-a-ate my heart out. (Silly boy.)
Look at him, look at me,
That boy is bad, and honestly,
He's a wolf in disguise,
But I can't stop staring in those evil eyes. 
(Evil eyes, evil eyes).
I asked my girlfriend if she'd seen you round before. (Oh, yeah)
She mumbled something while we got down on the floor, baby. (Ah)
We might've fucked, not really sure, don't quite recall. (Oh, yeah)
But something tells me that I've seen him. Yeah, 
That boy is a monster. (M-m-m-monster.)
That boy is a monster. (M-m-m-monster.)
That boy is a monster. (M-m-m-monster.)
That boy is a monster-er-er-er-er.
He ate my heart. (I love that girl.)
He ate my heart. (Wanna talk to her, she's hot as Hell.)
He ate my heart. (I love that girl.)
He ate my heart. (Wanna talk to her, she's hot as Hell.)
He licked his lips, said to me,
"Girl, you look good enough to eat."
Put his arms around me,
Said "boy, now get your paws right off me."
I asked my girlfriend if she'd seen you round before. (Oh, yeah)
She mumbled something while we got down on the floor, baby. (Ah)
We might've fucked, not really sure, don't quite recall. (Oh, yeah)
But something tells me that I've seen him. Yeah, 
That boy is a monster. (M-m-m-monster.)
(Could I love him?)
That boy is a monster. (M-m-m-monster.)
(Could I love him?)
That boy is a monster. (M-m-m-monster.)
(Could I love him?)
That boy is a monster-er-er-er-er.
He ate my heart. (I love that girl.)
He ate my heart. (Wanna talk to her, she's hot as Hell.)
He ate my heart. (I love that girl.)
He ate my heart. (Wanna talk to her, she's hot as Hell.)
He ate my heart, he ate my heart,
Instead, he's the monster in my bed.
He ate my heart, he ate my heart,
Instead, he's the monster in my bed.
I wanna Just Dance, but he took me home instead, 
Uh-oh, there was a monster in my bed.
We French kissed on a subway train, 
He tore my clothes right off,
He ate my heart and then he ate my brain,
Oh woah oh. (I love that girl.)
Oh woah oh. (Wanna talk to her, she's hot as Hell.)
He ate my heart, (oh woah oh.)
he a-a-ate my heart. (I love that girl.) (Oh woah oh.)
He ate my heart. (wanna talk to her, she's hot as Hell)
That boy, that boy, that boy, 
That boy, that boy, that boy.
That boy is a monster. (M-m-m-monster.)
(Could I love him?)
That boy is a monster. (M-m-m-monster.)
(Could I love him?)
That boy is a monster. (M-m-m-monster.)
(Could I love him?)
That boy is a monster-er-er-er-er.
That boy is a monster. (He ate my heart.) (M-m-m-monster.)
(He a-a-ate my heart.) (Could I love him?)
That boy is a monster. (He ate my heart.) (M-m-m-monster.)
(He a-) (Could I love him?)
That boy is a monster. (M-m-m-monster.)
(Could I love him?)
That boy is a monster-er-er-er-er.
