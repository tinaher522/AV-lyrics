(Initiate)
(Cherry Cherry Boom Boom)
(Lady Gaga)
(I like it rough)
Your love is nothing I can't fight
Can't sleep with the man who dims my shine
I'm in the bedroom (bedroom) with tissues and when
I know you're outside banging and I won't let you in
'Cause it's a hard life (hard life) with love in the world
And I'm a hard girl loving me is like chewing on pearls (chewing on pearls)
You got me wondering why I, I like it rough
I-I like it rough, I-I like it rough
You got me wondering why I, I like it rough
I-I like it rough, I-I like it rough
Won't go without my fix tonight
(Oo) it's a little too rough
Prom girl wipes her tears with silver lines
(Oo) and she can't get enough
I'm in the bedroom (bedroom) with tissues and when
I know you're outside banging but I won't let you in (won't let you in)
'Cause it's a hard life with love in the world
And I'm a hard girl loving me is like straightening curls (straightening curls)
You got me wondering why I, I like it rough
I-I like it rough, I-I like it rough
You got me wondering why I, I like it rough
I-I like it rough, I-I like it rough
Shiny and I know it
Don't know why you wanna blow it
Need a man who likes it rough
Likes it rough, likes it rough (baby likes it rough)
I'm shiny and I know it
Don't know why you wanna blow it
Need a man who likes it rough
Likes it rough, likes it rough (baby likes it rough)
Is it 'cause you don't mean it?
Or because I don't feel it unless it's rough?
Is it 'cause you don't mean it?
Or because I don't feel it unless it's rough?
You got me wondering why I, I like it rough
I-I like it rough, I-I like it rough
You got me wondering why I, I like it rough
I-I like it rough, I-I like it rough
You got me wondering why I, I like it rough
I-I like it rough, I-I like it rough
You got me wondering why I, I like it rough
I-I like it rough, I-I like it rough
