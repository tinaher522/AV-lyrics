Ow, come here boy
I met a drummer last week
At a pool bar, down b-by the shore
With a body like that, and your stone washed eyes
I want you more
He cried, "Mother! What'd you do to me?"
I said, "Mother mother mother's for babies
Call me kitty."
Yeah
Shake Ur kitty
Shake Ur kitty (meow)
Put your arms around me, babe
I'm giving you permission to feel me
Shake Ur kitty
Shake Ur kitty (meow)
Put your arms around me, babe
I'm giving you permission to feel me
Shake Ur shake
Shake shake
Shake Ur sh-shake
Shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake
I took a drummer by the hand
To the juke box then
We hit the floor
With your Van Halen pin
And your dark side burns
I want you more
He cried, "Mother! What'd you do to me?"
I said, "Mother mother mother's for babies
Call me kitty."
Oh, why dontcha
Shake Ur kitty
Shake Ur kitty (meow)
Put your arms around me, babe
I'm giving you permission to feel me
Shake Ur kitty
Shake Ur kitty (meow)
Put your arms around me, babe
I'm giving you permission to feel me
You'll never call me by my name
But I still want you
You play some pretty tricky games
But I still want you
Your best friend drives a fancy car
But I still want you
You're working every hour
But, but I still want you yeah!
If you see a girl this pretty
Shake her, shake her, shake that kitty
When you see a girl that's pretty
Shake it, shake it, shake that kitty
Shake Ur kitty (meow)
Put your arms around me, babe
I'm giving you permission to feel me
Shake Ur kitty
Why don't you
Shake Ur kitty (meow)
Put your arms around me, babe
I'm giving you permission to feel me
When you see a girl this pretty
Shake her, shake her, shake that kitty
When you see a girl that's pretty
Shake Ur, shake Ur, shake that kitty
Shake Ur shake
Shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake
