<song artist="Lady_Gaga" title="Viva_La_Vida">
I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own
I used to roll the dice 
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes 
Listen as the crowd would sing
"Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!"  
One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand
I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing 
Be my Chris and I'll be your Gwyneth
My missionaries hidin' in foreign trenches
For some reason I can't explain 
Once you'd gone there was never 
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world
It was the wicked and wild wind 
Like just The Doors' Love Her Madly and let her in 
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become  
Revolutionaries wait 
For my blonde head on a silver plate
Just a GaGa on a lonely string 
Oh who would ever want to be queen?
I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringin'
Roman Cavalry choirs are singin' 
Be my Chris and I'll be your Gwyneth  
For some reason that I can't explain
I know Yves Saint Laurent, no, he won't call my name
Never an honest word 
But that was when I ruled the world  
I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringin' 
Roman Cavalry choirs are singin' 
Be my Chris and I'll be your Gwyneth
The fame won't change us if we don't let it  
For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Mary won't call my name
Never an honest word 
But that was when I ruled the world,
Ruled the world,
Ruled the world
