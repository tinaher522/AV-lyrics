<song artist="Lady_Gaga" title="So_Happy_I_Could_Die">
Eh-eh, eh-eh
Ye-ha, ye-ha
Eh-eh, eh-eh
A-ha, a-ha
Eh-eh, eh-eh
Ye-ha, ye-ha
Eh-eh, eh-eh
A-ha, a-ha
I love that lavender blonde
The way she moves, the way she walks
I touch myself, can't get enough
And in the silence of the night
Through all the tears and all the lies
I touch myself and it's alright
Just give in
Don't give up, baby
Open up your heart and your mind to me
Just know when (just, know when)
That glass is empty
That the world is gonna bend, yeah
Happy in the club with a bottle of red wine
Stars in our eyes 'cause we're having a good time
Eh-eh, eh-eh
So happy I could die
Be your best friend and I'll love you forever
Up in the clouds, we'll be higher than ever
Eh-eh, eh-eh 
So happy I could die and it's alright
Eh-eh, eh-eh 
Ye-ha, ye-ha
Eh-eh, eh-eh 
A-ha, a-ha
Eh-eh, eh-eh 
Ye-ha, ye-ha
Eh-eh, eh-eh 
A-ha, a-ha
I am as vain as I allow
I do my hair, I gloss my eyes
I touch myself all through the night
And when something falls out of place
I take my time, I put it back
I touch myself 'til I'm on track
Just give in
Don't give up, baby
Open up your heart and your mind to me
Just know when (just, know when)
That glass is empty
That the world is gonna bend, yeah
Happy in the club with a bottle of red wine
Stars in our eyes 'cause we're having a good time
Eh-eh, eh-eh
So happy I could die
Be your best friend and I'll love you forever
Up in the clouds, we'll be higher than ever
Eh-eh, eh-eh 
So happy I could die and it's alright
So happy I could die and it's alright
(Oooh)
So happy I could die and it's alright
Eh-eh, eh-eh
Ye-ha, ye-ha
Eh-eh, eh-eh
A-ha, a-ha
Eh-eh, eh-eh
Ye-ha, ye-ha
Eh-eh, eh-eh
A-ha, a-ha
Happy in the club with a bottle of red wine
Stars in our eyes 'cause we're having a good time
Eh-eh, eh-eh
So happy I could die
Be your best friend and I'll love you forever
Up in the clouds, we'll be higher than ever
Eh-eh, eh-eh 
So happy I could die and it's alright
Happy in the club with a bottle of red wine
Stars in our eyes 'cause we're having a good time
Eh-eh, eh-eh
So happy I could die
Be your best friend and I'll love you forever
Up in the clouds, we'll be higher than ever
Eh-eh, eh-eh 
So happy I could die and it's alright
