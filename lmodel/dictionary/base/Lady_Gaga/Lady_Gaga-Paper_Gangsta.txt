<song artist="Lady_Gaga" title="Paper_Gangsta">
Midnight rush with a pen in my hand
Inkin' Lincoln sanskrit with a fan
Remembering me before we began
Sometimes I felt so def in the jam
But the ones who loved me told me to stop
Like homegirl, can't catch shit if it drops
A superwoman chick, you know that I am
Some shit don't fly by me in a man
'Cause I do not accept any less
Than someone just as real, as fabulous
Don't want no paper gangsta
Won't sign away my life to
Someone whose got the flavor
But don't have no follow through
Don't want no paper gangsta
Won't sign no monkey papers
I don't do funny business
Not interested in fakers
Don't want no paper gangsta, oh oh
Don't want no paper gangsta, oh oh
Don't want no paper gangsta
Don't want no paper gangsta
Got something real shiny to start
Want me to sign there on your Range Rover heart
I've heard it before, yeah, the dinners were nice
Till your diamond words melted into some ice
You should have been rapping to the beat of my song
Mr. California, paper gangster-a
I'm looking for love, not an empty page
Full of stuff that means nothing but 'you've been pa-layed'
'Cause I do not accept any less
Than someone just as real, as fabulous
Don't want no paper gangsta
Won't sign away my life to
Someone whose got the flavor
But don't have no follow through
Don't want no paper gangsta
Won't sign no monkey papers
I don't do funny business
Not interested in fakers
Don't want no paper gangsta, oh oh
Don't want no paper gangsta, oh oh
Don't want no paper gangsta
Don't want no paper gangsta
Toh day da yeah no day oh yeah
Toh day da yeah no day oh yeah
Toh day da yeah no day oh yeah
Don't want no paper gangsta
Won't sign away my life to
Someone whose got the flavor
But don't have no follow through
Don't want no paper gangsta
Won't sign no monkey papers
I don't do funny business
Not interested in fakers
Don't want no paper gangsta
Won't sign away my life to
Someone whose got the flavor
But don't have no follow through
Don't want no paper gangsta
Won't sign no monkey papers
I don't do funny business
Not interested in fakers
Don't want no paper gangsta, oh oh
Don't want no paper gangsta, oh oh
Don't want no paper gangsta
Don't want no paper gangsta
Don't want no paper gangsta
Don't want no paper gangsta
Toh day da yeah no day oh yeah
