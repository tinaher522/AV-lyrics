<song artist="Lady_Gaga" title="Bloody_Mary">
Love is just a history that they may prove,
And when You're gone I'll tell them my religion's You
When Pontius¹ come to kill the King upon His throne,
I'm ready for their stones.
I'll dance dance dance
With my hands hands hands
Above my head head head
Like Jesus said
I'm gonna dance dance dance
With my hands hands hands
Above my head
Dance together
Forgive him before he's dead, because
I won't cry for you
I won't crucify the things you do
I won't cry for you,(gaga) see (see) (gaga) 
When you're gone (gaga) I'll still be Bloody Mary (gaga)
Love!
We are not just art for Michelangelo to carve
He can't rewrite the agro of my furied heart
I'll wait on mountain tops in Paris cold
Je ne veux pas mourir toute seule.²
I'll dance dance dance
With my hands hands hands
Above my head head head
Like Jesus said
I'm gonna dance dance dance
With my hands hands hands
Above my head
Dance together
Forgive him before he's dead, because
I won't cry for you
I won't crucify the things you do
I won't cry for you,(gaga) see (see) (gaga) 
When you're gone (gaga) I'll still be Bloody Mary (gaga)
Ah-ah-aaah
Love!
Gaga, gaga, gaga
Gaga, gaga, gaga, gaga
