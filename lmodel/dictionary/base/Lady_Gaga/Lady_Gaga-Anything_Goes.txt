<song artist="Lady_Gaga" title="Anything_Goes">
Lady Gaga:
In olden days, a glimpse of stocking
Was looked on as something shocking
Now heaven knows
Anything goes
Tony Bennett:
Good authors too who once knew better words
Now only use four letter words
Writing prose
Anything goes
The world has gone mad today
And good's bad today
Lady Gaga:
And day's night today
And black's white today
Tony Bennett:
When most guys today that women prize today
Lady Gaga:
Are just silly gigolos
Tony Bennett:
And though I'm not a great romancer
Lady Gaga:
I know that you're bound to answer
Both:
When we propose
Anything goes
Tony Bennett:
Go
Lady Gaga:
Go
Whoo
The world has gone mad today
Tony Bennett:
And good's bad today
Lady Gaga:
And day's night today
Tony Bennett:
And black's white today
Lady Gaga:
And most guys today that women prize today
Are just silly gigolos
Tony Bennett:
And
Both:
Though we're not a great romancers
We know that you're bound to answer
When we propose
Anything goes
Tony Bennett:
Anything goes
Lady Gaga:
Anything goes
Both:
Anything goes
