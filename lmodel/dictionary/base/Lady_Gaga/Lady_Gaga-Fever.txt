<song artist="Lady_Gaga" title="Fever">
There he goes
My baby walks so slow
Sexual tic-tac-toe
Yeah, I know we both know
It isn't time
But would you be m-mine?
We'll never get too far
Just you, me and the bar
Silly ménage à trois sometimes
Would you be m-mine?
Would you be m-mine?
Would you be m-mine?
Oh baby, lights on
But your mom's not home
I'm sick of laying down alone
With this fever, fever yeah
I want it all
Now I'm gonna get you alone
Give you a fever, fever yeah
There it goes
You stole my soul and so
'Cause, sweetheart
A-no-nobody a-no-no-knows
They're occupied
Tell me you'll be mine
Let's get inside your car
Just you, me and the stars
Kind of ménage à trois
Sometimes
Would you be m-mine?
Would you be m-mine?
Could you be mine?
Oh baby, lights on
But your mom's not home
I'm sick of laying down alone
With this fever, fever yeah
I want it all
Now I'm gonna get you alone
Give you a fever, fever yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah
Oh baby, your light's on
But your mom's not home
I'm sick of laying down alone
With this fever, fever yeah
I want it all
Now I'm gonna get you alone
Give you a fever, fever yeah
Fever, fever, yeah
