<song artist="Lady_Gaga" title="Red_And_Blue">
One, two,
I think I love you,
You got ripped jeans,
I'm only nineteen,
What do you wanna do?
You got your cigarette,
I got my headset,
We're two of a kind,
You're spades and I'm diamonds,
And you know that you,
Yeah, you can see clearly,
That I am the one you want.
But I must admit that,
I'm everything you're not.
Yeah, I am red, you are blue,
I'm old school and you're so new,
But I guess I could forgive you tonight.
When you're cold, I like to burn,
I cut lines, you wait you turn,
But I guess I could forgive you tonight.
Tonight, tonight, tonight.
Don't shoot,
My heart is on mute,
Our physical dreams,
Are only skin deep.
How do you wanna groove?
Bang, Bang.
D'you hear my gun ring? (Oh, yeah)
You're mine, you're there,
You'll hear that.
I am all up inside your head. (oh, oh, oh)
Now I can see clearly,
That I am the one you want.
But I must admit that,
I'm everything you're not.
Yeah, I am red, you are blue,
I'm old school and you're so new,
But I guess I could forgive you tonight.
When you're cold, I like to burn,
I cut lines, you wait you turn,
But I guess I could forgive you tonight.
Tonight, tonight, tonight.
You won't forget me when I'm gone.
This feels so good, it can't be wrong.
I reccommend, a one night stand.
I know we're just friends,
But, you're my kind of man.
Just for tonight,
Just for tonight,
Just for tonight.
Even though I'm red, you are blue,
I'm old school and you're so new,
I know we could be great for tonight.
When you're cold, I'll make it burn,
You'll never have to wait your turn,
Yeah, I guess I could forgive you tonight.
Tonight, tonight, tonight.
Yeah, I am red, you are blue,
I'm old school and you're so new,
But I guess I could forgive you tonight.
When you're cold, I like to burn,
I cut lines, you wait your turn,
But I guess I could forgive you tonight.
Tonight, tonight, tonight.
