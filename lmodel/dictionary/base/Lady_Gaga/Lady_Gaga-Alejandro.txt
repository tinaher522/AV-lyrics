<song artist="Lady_Gaga" title="Alejandro">
I know that we are young,
And I know that you may love me,
But I just can't be with you like this anymore,
Alejandro.
She's got both hands, in her pocket,
And she won't look at you, won't look at you.
She hides true love, en su bolsillo,
She's got a halo around her finger, around you.
You know that I love you, boy,
Hot like Mexico, rejoice.
At this point I've gotta choose,
Nothing to lose.
Don't call my name, don't call my name, Alejandro.
I'm not your babe, I'm not your babe, Fernando.
Don't wanna kiss, don't wanna touch,
Just smoke my cigarette and hush.
Don't call my name, don't call my name, Roberto.
Alejandro, Alejandro.
Ale-Alejandro, Ale-Alejandro.
Alejandro, Alejandro.
Ale-Alejandro, Ale-Alejandro.
Stop, please, just let me go,
Alejandro, just let me go.
She's not broken, she's just a baby,
But her boyfriend's like her dad, just like a dad.
And all those flames that burned before him,
Now, he's gotta firefight, gotta cool the bad.
You know that I love you, boy,
Hot like Mexico, rejoice.
At this point I've gotta choose,
Nothing to lose.
Don't call my name, don't call my name, Alejandro.
I'm not your babe, I'm not your babe, Fernando.
Don't wanna kiss, don't wanna touch,
Just smoke my cigarette and hush.
Don't call my name, don't call my name, Roberto.
Alejandro, Alejandro.
Ale-Alejandro, Ale-Alejandro.
Alejandro, Alejandro.
Ale-Alejandro, Ale-Alejandro.
Don't bother me, don't bother me. (Alejandro)
Don't call my name, don't call my name. (Bye, Fernando)
I'm not your babe, I'm not your babe. (Alejandro)
Don't wanna kiss, don't wanna touch, Fernando.
Don't call my name, don't call my name, Alejandro.
I'm not your babe, I'm not your babe, Fernando.
Don't wanna kiss, don't wanna touch,
Just smoke my cigarette and hush.
Don't call my name, don't call my name, Roberto.
Alejandro, Alejandro.
Ale-Alejandro, Ale-Alejandro.
Alejandro, Alejandro.
Ale-Alejandro, Ale-Alejandro.
(Don't call my name) Alejandro, 
(don't call my name) Alejandro. (Alejandro)
(I'm not your babe) Ale-Alejandro, 
(I'm not your babe) Ale-Alejandro. (Fernando)
(Don't wanna kiss) Alejandro, 
(Don't wanna touch) Alejandro.
(Just smoke my cigarette and hush)
(Don't call my name) Ale-Alejandro, 
(don't call my name) Ale-Alejandro. (Roberto)
Alejandro
