It doesn't matter if you love him,
Or capital H-I-M.
Just put your paws up,
'Cause you were born this way baby.
Just put your paws up,
'Cause you were born this way, baby.
Capital H-I-M.
Don't hide yourse-
Just love yourse-
I'm on the ri-
Baby, love yourse-
Don't hide yourse-
Just love yourse-
I'm on the ri-
Baby, love yourse-
My mama told me when I was young,
We are all born superstars.
She rolled my hair, put my lipstick on,
In the glass of her boudoir.
"There's nothin' wrong with lovin' who you are,"
She said, "Cause he made you perfect, babe,
"So hold your head up girl and you'll go far,
Listen to me when I say."
I'm beautiful in my way,
'Cause God makes no mistakes,
I'm on the right track, baby,
I was born this way.
Don't hide yourself in regret,
Just love yourself and you're set,
I'm on the right track baby,
I was born this way, born this way.
God makes no-
Mistakes, I'm on the-ยน
Baby I was bor-
Don't hide yourse-
Just love yourse-
I'm on the ri-
Baby I, I, I-
A- uh- this way
Don't be a drag, just be a queen
Don't be a drag, just be a queen
It doesn't matter if you love him,
(Same DNA)
Or capital H-I-M.
(But born this way)
Give yourself prudence and love your friends,
Subway kid, rejoice your truth.
In the religion of the insecure,
I must be myself, respect my youth.
A different lover is not a sin,
Believe capital H-I-M.
I love my life I love this record and,
Mi amore vole fe yah. (Same DNA)
I'm beautiful in my way,
'Cause God makes no mistakes,
I'm on the right track, baby,
I was born this way.
Don't hide yourself in regret,
Just love yourself and you're set,
I'm on the right track baby,
I was born this way, born this way.
I'm beautif-
'Cause God makes no-
I'm on the ri-
Baby I, I, I-
Don't hide yourse-
