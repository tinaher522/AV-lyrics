<song artist="Lady_Gaga" title="Tea">
I don't want to rule the world
It's a change I'm here to see
I walk along on a lonely road
Of many wonders to believe
You can try to heed their talk
Or sellin' out a masterpiece
You've got a trunk full of gold
I got someone to believe
This ain't about kings or queens
In a battle you and me
Do you need a dose of truth?
What am I supposed to do?
How can you deal with it?
Do you just avoid the guilt?
Something you gotta know
If you can't deal with me
Shut your mouth
Sip on that tea
It's been so long 
Since I've had a sip 
And got this feelin'
I need the green detox 
The truth will be the winner tonight
I don't want to rule the world
It's a change I'm here to see
I walk along on a lonely road
Of many wonders to believe
You can try to heed their talk
Or sellin' out a masterpiece
You've got a trunk full of gold
I got someone to believe
This ain't about kings or queens
In a battle you and me
Do you need a dose of truth?
What am I supposed to do?
How can you deal with it?
Do you just avoid the guilt?
Something you gotta know
If you can't deal with me
Shut your mouth
Sip on that tea
It's been so long 
Since I've had a sip 
And got this feelin'
I need the green detox 
The truth will be the winner tonight
This ain't about kings or queens
Do you need a dose of truth?
This ain't about kings or queens
In a battle you and me
Do you need a dose of truth?
What am I supposed to do?
How can you deal with it?
Do you just avoid the guilt?
Something you gotta know
If you can't deal with me
Shut your mouth
Sip on that tea
It's been so long 
Since I've had a sip 
And got this feelin'
I need the green detox 
The truth will be the winner tonight
