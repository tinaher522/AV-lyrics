<song artist="Lady_Gaga" title="Bad_Kids">
We don't care what people say
We know the truth
Enough is enough with this horse shit
I am not a freak
I was born with my free gun
Don't tell me I'm less than my freedom
I'm a bitch
I'm a loser, baby maybe I should quit
I'm a jerk
Wish I had the money, but I can't find work
I'm a brat
I'm a selfish punk, I really should be smacked
My parents tried
'til they got divorced 'cause I ruined their lives
I'm a bad kid
And I will survive
Oh  I'm a bad kid
Don't know wrong from right
I'm a bad kid
And this is my life
One of the bad kids
Don't know wrong from right
Don't be insecure if your heart is pure
You're still good to me if you're a bad kid baby
Don't be insecure if your heart is pure
You're still good to me if you're a bad kid
A bad kid baby
A bad kid baby
I'm a twit
Degenerate young rebel and I'm proud of it
Pump your fist
If you would rather mess up than put up with this
I'm a nerd
I chew gum and smoke in your face
I'm absurd
I'm so bad, 'n' I don't give a damn, I love it when you're mad
When you're mad, when you're mad
I'm a bad kid
And I will survive
Oh  I'm a bad kid
Don't know wrong from right
I'm a bad kid
And this is my life
One of the bad kids
Don't know wrong from right
Don't be insecure if your heart is pure
You're still good to me if you're a bad kid baby
Don't be insecure if your heart is pure
You're still good to me if you're a bad kid
A bad kid baby
A bad kid baby
I'm not that typical baby
I'm a bad kid
Like my mom and dad made me
I'm not that cool and you hate me
I'm a bad kid, that's the way they made me
I'm a bad kid I'm disastrous
Give me your money
Or I'll hold my breath
I'm a bad kid
And I will survive
One of the bad kids
Don't know wrong from right
Don't be insecure if your heart is pure
You're still good to me if you're a bad kid baby
Don't be insecure if your heart is pure
You're still good to me if you're a bad kid
A bad kid baby
A bad kid baby
A bad kid baby
A bad kid baby
A bad kid baby
