<song artist="Lady_Gaga" title="Take_You_Out">
Last week I saw you out
And I knew we would be
A match in heaven
Just the coolest kind of team
I know there ain't no 
Way that we won't
Cuz we won't stop 'til we
Go, go the distance
Well we just can't
Baby, I believe it
I still believe it
And you know we won't be defeated
In my heart I believe it
Yeah, you and me are gonna win it, baby
I'm gonna take you out, 
Take you out, take you out
We're gonna show this town 
What I know we're about
Shoot it. Run it. What's it called?
Everybody loves it - Football!
Shoot it. Run it. What's it called?
Everybody loves it - Football!
I've got a feelin' that
This year could be the one
We're gonna tear it up
And burn out everyone
I know there ain't no 
Way that we won't
Cuz we won't stop til we
Go, Go the distance
Well we just can't
Baby, I believe it
I still believe it
And you know we won't be defeated
In my heart I believe it
Yeah, you and me are gonna win it, baby
I'm gonna take you out, 
Take you out, take you out
We're gonna show this town 
What I know we're about
Shoot it. Run it. What's it called?
Everybody loves it - Football!
Shoot it. Run it. What's it called?
Everybody loves it - Football!
Shoot it. Run it. What's it called?
Everybody loves it - Football!
Shoot it. Run it. What's it called?
Everybody loves it - Football!
New York, Paris, London, Munich
Everybody talk about pop music
I still believe it
And you know we won't be defeated
In my heart I believe it
Yeah, you and me are gonna win it, baby
I'm gonna take you out, 
Take you out, take you out
We're gonna show this town 
What I know we're about
I still believe it
And you know we won't be defeated
In my heart I believe it
Yeah, you and me are gonna win it, baby
I'm gonna take you out, 
Take you out, take you out
We're gonna show this town 
What I know we're about
