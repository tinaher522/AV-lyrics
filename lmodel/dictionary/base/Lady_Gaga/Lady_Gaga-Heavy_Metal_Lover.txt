(Heavy metal lover, heavy metal lover)
(Heavy metal lover, heavy metal lover)
(Heavy metal lover, heavy metal lover)
(Heavy metal lover, heavy metal lover)
(My heavy metal lover, heavy metal lover)
(Heavy metal lover, my heavy metal lover)
(Heavy metal lover)
I want your whiskey mouth
All over my blonde south.
Red wine, cheap perfume,
And a filthy pout.
Tonight bring all your friends,
Because a group does it better.
Why river with a pair?
Let's have a full house of leather.
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-who,
who-who, who-who
Heavy metal lover.
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-who,
who-who, who-who
Heavy metal lover.
Dirty pony, I
Can't wait to hose you down.
You've got to earn your leather,
In this part of town.
Dirty pearls and a patch,
For all the Rivington Rebels.
Let's raise hell in the streets,
Drink beer and get into trouble.
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-who,
who-who, who-who
Heavy metal lover.
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-who,
who-who, who-who
Heavy metal lover.
I could be your girl,
Girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
But would you love me
If I ruled the world, world, world?
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-who,
who-who, who-who
Heavy metal lover.
Whip me, slap me, punk funk,
New York clubbers, bump drunk,
Bud Lite, liquors, bar slam,
Move it, this is your jam.
Wash the night with St. Jame-son,
Like a baptism, heavy metal lovers play,
Baby we were born this way.
Who-Who-Who, ooh-who,
who-who, who-who
Who-Who-Who, ooh-who,
who-who, who-who
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-who,
who-who, who-who
Heavy metal lover.
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-who,
who-who, who-who
Heavy metal lover.
I could be your girl, (Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-who)
Girl, girl, girl, girl, girl (who-who, who-who)
But would you love me (Heavy metal lover)
If I ruled the world, world, world? (Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-who, Heavy metal lover)
(Heavy metal lover, heavy metal lover)
(Heavy metal lover, heavy metal lover)
(Heavy metal lover, heavy metal lover)
(Heavy metal lover, heavy metal lover)
(Heavy metal lover, heavy metal)
