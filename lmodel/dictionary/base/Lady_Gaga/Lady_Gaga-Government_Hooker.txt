Io ritorne¹
Io ritorne
Io ritorne
Government Hooker-ey
I can be good (if you just wanna be bad)
I can be cool (if you just wanna be mad)
I can be anything, I'll be your everything
Just touch me, baby (I don't wanna be sad)
As long as I'm your hooker (back up and turn around)
As long as I'm your hooker (hands on the ground)
As long as I'm your hooker (back up and turn around)
As long as I'm your hooker (get down)
Hooker (yeah, you're my hooker)
Hooker (government hooker)
Hooker (yeah, you're my hooker)
Hooker (government hooker)
I'm gonna drink my tears tonight
I'm gonna drink my tears and cry
'Cause I know you love me, baby
I know you love me, baby
I could be girl (unless you want to be man)
I could be sex (unless you want to hold hands)
I could be anything, I could be everything (Iku Iku²)
I could be mom (unless you want to be dad. Ay, ¡mi papito!³)
As long as I'm your hooker (back up and turn around)
As long as I'm your hooker (hands on the ground)
As long as I'm your hooker (back up and turn around)
As long as I'm your hooker (get down)
Hooker (yeah, you're my hooker)
Hooker (government hooker)
Hooker (yeah, you're my hooker)
Hooker (government hooker)
Put your hands on me
John F. Kennedy
I'll make you squeal, baby
As long as you pay me (ow)
I'm gonna drink my tears tonight
I'm gonna drink my tears and cry
'Cause I know you love me, baby
I know you love me, baby
Hooker (yeah, you're my hooker)
Hooker (government hooker)
Hooker (yeah, you're my hooker)
Hooker (government hooker)
I could be girl (unless you want to be man) (Io ritorne)
I could be sex (unless you want to hold hands) (Io ritorne)
I could be anything, I could be everything (Io ritorne)
I could be mom (unless you want to be dad)
I wanna (BEEP!) government hooker (back up and turn around)
Stop (BEEP!) me, government hooker (put your hands on the ground)
I wanna (BEEP!) government hooker (back up and turn around)
Stop (BEEP!) me, government hooker (get down)
Yeah
