<song artist="Whitesnake" title="Give_Me_More_Time">
I want you, I need your rhyme
But you keep saying, babe, it's gonna take time
I know the heartache I put you through
Believe me, babe, I'm gonna make it up to you
You are the reason
I'm down on my knees
I'm begging you to give me a chance
If only you would
Give me just a little more time
Give me just a little more time
Give me just a little more time
Give me just a little more time
To prove it to you
So many feelings I can't explain
I never thought I'd ever cause you any pain
Now I'm alone here and I can't hide
The sun don't shine for me without you by my side
You are the reason
I'm down on my knees
I'm begging you to give me a chance
If only you would
Give me just a little more time
Give me just a little more time
Give me just a little more time
Give me just a little more time
To prove it to you
I'm gonna prove it, woah
I want you right by my side
'Cause you're the only one who keeps me satisfied
I need your loving, I need your charms
Can't stand the through of you in someone else's arms
You are the reason
I'm down on my knees
I'm begging you to give me a chance
If only you would
Give me just a little more time
Give me just a little more time
Give me just a little more time
Give me just a little more time
Give me just a little more time
Baby, give me just a little more time
Give me just a little more time
You've got to give me just a little more time
To prove it to you
And I'm gonna prove it
