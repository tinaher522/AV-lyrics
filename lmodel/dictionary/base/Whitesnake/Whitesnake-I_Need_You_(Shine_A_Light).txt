<song artist="Whitesnake" title="I_Need_You_(Shine_A_Light)">
Hear me knocking on your door
Can't help myself, I keep coming back for more
I'm begging you, let me stay
I want you so bad, babe, I can't keep away
I'm on fire
You got my love burning higher and higher
Baby, baby, please
I need you to shine a light
I need you to hold me tight
I need you to shine a light
Bringing me home again
You got class, you got style
With all your tricks, babe, you're so versatile
So much more than one man can claim
You pull me in like a moth to a flame
I'm on fire
You got my love burning higher and higher
Baby, baby, please
I need you to shine a light
I need you to hold me tight
I need you to shine a light
Bringing me home again
I need you, baby, baby, please
I need you, shine a light for me
I need you, shine a light for me
I need you, baby, baby, baby, please
I need you to shine a light
I need you to hold me tight
I need you to shine a light
I need you to hold me tight
I need you to shine a light
I need you, baby, hold me tight
I need you to shine a light
Bringing me home again
Bringing me home again
