<song artist="Whitesnake" title="Hungry_For_Love">
I keep hangin' on the promise of love
Your eyes tell me that I'm gonna see
I feel the hunger like a starving man
Honey, when you stand close to me
I start to shiver, I start to shake
Chills up and down my spine
I'm in the mood for action, in need of satisfaction
Babe, I'm gonna make you mine
Now I believe in you
And everything that you do, wooh
'Cause I'm hungry for love
I'm hungry for love
I'm hungry for love
I can't get enough, I can't get enough, I can't get enough
I can't get enough, baby
I've got the weakness of an ordinary man
I need the comfort of womanly mind
But, I get nervous when I think about
So many women and so little time
But I believe in you
And everything that you do
'Cause I'm hungry for love
I'm hungry for love
I'm hungry for love
I can't get enough, I can't get enough, I can't get enough, wooh
Hungry for love
Hungry for love
Hungry for love
I start to shiver, I start to shake
Chills up and down my spine, yeah
(Hungry for love)
I get so nervous when I think about
So many women and not enough time
But I believe in you
And everything that you do
'Cause I'm hungry for love
I'm hungry for love
I'm hungry for love, baby
I can't get enough, I can't get enough, I can't get enough
I'm hungry for love
I'm hungry for love
I'm hungry for love
I can't get enough, I can't get enough, I can't get enough
Can't get enough, I can't get enough, I can't get enough
I just can't get enough, baby, mmm
I'm hungry for love
