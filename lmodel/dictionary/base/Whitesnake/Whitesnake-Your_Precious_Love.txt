<song artist="Whitesnake" title="Your_Precious_Love">
I'm far from home and tired of this place
I miss your good, good love and your sweet embrace
Can't sleep at night with you on my mind
I just want to run to you, baby, leave it all behind
'Cause it seems so long
Since I heard your song
I'm coming home to you, baby
Back where I belong
Your precious love
That's all I need,
Angel, spread your wings
And bring it on home to me
Sometimes in my life I don't know what to do
Though I'm weak for myself I try to be strong for you
You're there when I need you after all these years
So I send you this letter, baby, written in tears
'Cause it seems so long
Since I heard your song
I'm coming home to you, baby, baby
Back where I belong
Your precious love
That's all I need,
Angel, spread your wings
And bring it on home to me
'Cause it seems so long
Since I heard your song
I'm coming home to you, baby
Back where I belong
Your precious love
That's all I need
Angel, spread your wings
And bring it, bring it, bring on home
Your precious love
Your precious love
That's all that I need
Angel spread your wing
And bring it, bring it, bring on home
Bring it, baby, baby
That's all I want
Your precious love
Your precious love
That's all I need
Your precious love
Your precious love
Your precious love
That's all I need
Come on bring on home, baby
Won't you bring on home
I need your love
