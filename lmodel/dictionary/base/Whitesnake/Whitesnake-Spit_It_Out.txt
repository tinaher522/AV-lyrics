<song artist="Whitesnake" title="Spit_It_Out">
I never knew what a kiss could mean
Until the first time I kissed you
You took my love in the palm of your hand
And showed me what a woman could do
Now I don't want sugar coated loving
Just silver tongue tenderness
You gotta give me a certain satisfaction
The kind of love you seal with a kiss
Spit it out (spit it out), spit it out (spit it out), spit it out
If you don't like it
Spit it out (spit it out), spit it out (spit it out), spit it out
If you don't like it 
I can remember, I can recall
When I first set my eyes on you
I'll never forget the thrill of it all
Dreaming of the things we could do
Baby, you must be crazy
Fooling with a man like me
'Cause I roll my dice with a heart of ice
I make it clear to see
Spit it out (spit it out), spit it out (spit it out), spit it out
If you don't like it
Spit it out (spit it out), spit it out (spit it out), spit it out
If you don't like it 
I never knew what a kiss could mean
Till the first time I kissed you
You took my love in the palm of your hand
And showed me what a woman could do
Your sweet caress and tenderness
Can take the pain away
The things that you do make a queen out of you
Make me a king for a day
If you don't like it, spit it out
Now I know what your love can do
I'll be hanging 'round your door
And I'm gonna love you baby
I'm gonna give you more than you bargained for
Spit it out (spit it out), spit it out (spit it out), spit it out
If you don't like it
Spit it out (spit it out), spit it out (spit it out), spit it out
If you don't like it
Spit it out if you don't like it
Spit it out if you don't
Spit it out if you don't like it
Spit it out if you don't
Spit it out if you don't like it
Spit it out honey, if you don't
Spit it out if you don't like it
Spit it out if you don't
