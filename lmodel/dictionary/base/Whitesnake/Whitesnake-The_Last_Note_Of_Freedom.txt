<song artist="Whitesnake" title="The_Last_Note_Of_Freedom">
Here I am, burnin' man,
Singing the song of my open soul
Will time pass me?
All my dreams are heaven known
I don't wanna be cheated,
I can't go on, in a world where love is beaten
Rise up burnin' man,
Seize the wild take command.
Days of thunder see me shine,
All my dreams turn out fine
I know the suffering will end, my friend,
When the last note of freedom is rung throughout the land
I know the hateful will burn,
When the last note of freedom is heard throughout the land
I know the fear of dying,
Heard it from a meltdown blast
I know that lord have mercy,
It soon will pass
I know it
I don't wanna be cheated,
I can't go on, in a world where love is beaten,
Where love is defeated
I know the suffering will end, my friend,
When the last note of freedom is rung throughout the land
I know the hateful will burn,
When the last note of freedom is heard throughout the land
I know the fear of dying,
Heard from a meltdown blast
I know that lord have mercy,
It soon will pass
We need love
You gotta want it so bad
We need it now,
So run to it fast
I know it,
And the world will be cheated
I can't go on, in a world where love is defeated
I know it
I don't wanna be cheated,
I can't go on, in a world where love is defeated
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Where love is defeated
Can't go on, in a world where love's defeated
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
The last note of freedom
