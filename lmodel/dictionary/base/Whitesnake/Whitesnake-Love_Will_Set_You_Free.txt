<song artist="Whitesnake" title="Love_Will_Set_You_Free">
Something in your smile was so inviting
Something in your eyes told me to stay
Something in your touch electrified me
Completing me in every single way
Now I realise
As I look in your eyes
This must be love
Baby, try to understand
My heart is in your hand
Love will set you free
Love will set you free
You can trust in me
My love will set you free
Set you free
Every time I think about you, baby
And every time I see your smiling face
Every time I feel your loving arms around me
Guilty pleasures take up all my time and space
Now I realise
As I look in your eyes
This must be love
Baby, try to understand
My heart is in your hand
Love will set you free
Love will set you free
You can trust in me
My love will set you free
Set you free, set you free, set you free
Now I realise
As I look in your eyes
This must be love
Baby, try to understand
My heart is your hand
Love will set you free
Love will set you free
You can trust in me
My love will set you free
Set you free
Love will set you free
Love will set you free
You can trust in me
My love will set you free
Set you free, set you free
