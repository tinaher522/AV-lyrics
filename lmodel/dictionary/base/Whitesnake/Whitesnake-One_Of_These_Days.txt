<song artist="Whitesnake" title="One_Of_These_Days">
I've been thinking about the good times
Gathering souvenirs
Of the days when we were one
Before the love was gone
Those uncomfortable compromises
Always ending in bitter tears
Taking the love away
Leaving nothing more to say
But it's all right
I'll be there one of these days
And leave it all behind me
One of these days
A string of broken promises
An eternity of pain
Making enemies of desire
Suffocating all the fire
But still I miss your sweet breath
Your kisses on my face
And though the love is gone
The memory lingers on
But it's all right
I'll be there one of these days
And leave it all behind me
One of these days
But it's all right
I'll be there one of these days
And leave the past behind me
One of these days
You know love has always been
The queen of mystery
Broken hearts and bitter tears
Will be the death of me
One of these days
But it's all right
I'll be there one of these days
And leave it all behind me
One of these days
But it's all right
I'll be there one of these days
And And leave it all behind me
One of these days
But it's all right
I'll be there one of these days
And leave it all behind me
One of these days
But it's all right
I'll be there one of these days
And leave it all behind me
Leave it all behind me
Leave the past behind me
One of these days
