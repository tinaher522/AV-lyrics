<song artist="Whitesnake" title="She's_A_Woman">
She got everything I need,
She makes me smile, she makes me bleed
'Cos she's a woman 
She got the end, she got the means,
She's in my heart and in my dreams
An' it makes me cry I wanna make her mine
She ain't black, but, she got soul,
She ain't young, she ain't old,
She shine like silver, burn like gold
'Cos she's a woman, she's a woman 
She got everything I need,
She got comfort, she got speed
She's a woman, she's a woman 
She do me bad, she do me good,
She got the Gypsy in her blood
Cos' she's a woman, she's a woman 
She ain't black, but, she got soul,
She ain't young, she ain't old,
Shine like silver, burn like gold 
She's a woman, she's a woman 
She got a fire in her eyes,
I know she sees through all my lies,
'Cos she's a woman, she's a woman 
I know I'm the danger zone
If I leave her all alone
'Cos she's a woman, she's a woman
She ain't black, but, she got soul,
She ain't young, she ain't old,
Shine like silver, burn like gold
She's a woman, woman,
She's a woman, she's a woman
She's a woman, woman,
She's a woman 
She got everything I need,
She make me smile, she make me bleed
She's a woman, she's a woman 
She got the end, she got the means,
She, make me shiver in my jeans
'Cos she's a woman, she's a woman 
She ain't black, but, she got soul,
She ain't young, she ain't old
She shine like silver, burn like gold
'Cos she's a woman, she's a woman 
She's a woman...
