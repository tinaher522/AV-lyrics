<song artist="Whitesnake" title="Ain't_No_Love_In_The_Heart_Of_The_City">
Ain't no love in the heart of the city
Ain't no love in the heart of town
Ain't no love, sure 'nuff is a pity, baby
Ain't no love 'cause you ain't around
Baby, since you been around, oh no
Ain't no love in the heart of the city
Ain't no love in the heart of town
Ain't no love, sure 'nuff is a pity, child
Ain't no love 'cause you ain't around
Every place that I go
Well, it seems so strange
Without you love, baby, baby
Things have changed
Now that you're gone
Y'know the sun don't shine
From the city hall
To the county line, that's why
Ain't no love in the heart of the city
Ain't no love in the heart of town
Ain't no love, sure 'nuff is a pity
Ain't no love 'cause you ain't around
Now listen
Every place that I go
Well, it seems so strange
Without you love, baby, baby
Things have changed
Now that you're gone
Y'know the sun don't shine
From the city hall
Woman, to the county line, an' that's why
Ain't no love in the heart of the city
There ain't no love in the heart of town
There ain't no love, sure 'nuff is a pity
Ain't no love 'cause you ain't around, woman, woman
There ain't no love in the heart of the city
There ain't no love in the heart of town
Ain't no love, sure 'nuff is a pity
Ain't no love 'cause you ain't around
'Cause you ain't around
