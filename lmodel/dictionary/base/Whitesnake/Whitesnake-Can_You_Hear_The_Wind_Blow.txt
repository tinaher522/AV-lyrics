<song artist="Whitesnake" title="Can_You_Hear_The_Wind_Blow">
Over the mountains, across the sea
I know love is waitin’, for you and me
You don’t have to worry, it’s never too late
Grab a hold now baby, now don’t you hesitate?
All I want is just to spend my life with you
Can you hear the wind blow for me and you
Signifying changes we’re going through
Can you hear the wind blow?
Ride the rainbow, and you will see
There’s a Garden of Eden, for you and me
You don’t have to worry, just steal the fire inside
Pretty baby I want you, I’ll keep you satisfied
All I want is just to spend my life with you
Can you hear the wind blow for me and you
Signifying changes we’re going through
Can you hear the wind blow?
All I want is just to spend my life with you
Take it easy on the curves and we'll get through
Can you hear the wind blow?
Over the mountains, across the sea
I know love is waitin’, for you and me
You don’t have to worry, it’s never too late
Grab a hold now baby, now don’t you hesitate?
All I want is just to spend my life with you
Can you hear the wind blow for me and you
Signifying changes we’re going through
Can you hear the wind blow for me and you
Signifying changes we’re going through
Can you hear the wind blow for me and you
Signifying changes we’re going through
