<song artist="Whitesnake" title="Night_Hawk">
Gypsy woman told me
I've got to walk the night
Like a fallen angel,
I'm blinded by the light.
I need to find a love child,
Who never did no wrong.
A superstitious woman
To love me all night long.
Let me love you.
My heart beats like a hammer,
I'm scared of being alone,
I never thought I'd see the day
I'd curse when I was born.
Caught up in a fever, running hot 'n cold,
I need a sweet young woman
To satisfy my soul.
Let me love you.
Nighthawk, nighthawk
Shadow of the light,
A loner in the city streets
Crying in the night.
Nighthawk, nighthawk
Howling at the sky,
When the moon is on the rise
You'll hear the nighthawk cry.
Let me love you, let me love you.
(Solo)
Let me love you, let me love you, let me love you.
Gypsy woman told em
I've got to walk the night,
Like a fallen angel
I'm blinded by the light.
Caught up in a fever running hot 'n' cold,
Need a sweet young woman to satisfy my soul.
Let me love you.
Nighthawk, nighthawk
Shadow of the light,
A loner in the city streets
Crying in the night.
Nighthawk, nighthawk
Howling at the sky,
When the moon is on the rise
You'll hear the nighthawk cry.
Let me love you...
