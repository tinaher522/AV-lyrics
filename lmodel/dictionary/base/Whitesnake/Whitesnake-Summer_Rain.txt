<song artist="Whitesnake" title="Summer_Rain">
Lately I've been thinking
Even though I'm miles away
I can feel your love around me
You're with me every day
And of all the roads I've travelled
And all that I've been through
No matter where life takes me
Never far from you
You warm me like a morning sun
With you my life is just begun
Love comes over me
Falling like summer rain
Like summer rain
Pour your love on me
Feeling like summer rain
Like summer rain
I travelled each and every highway
With you in my heart
And all the gold and silver
Can't keep us apart
You warm me like a morning sun
With you my life is just begun
Love comes over me
Falling like summer rain
Like summer rain
Pour your love on me
Feeling like summer rain
Like summer rain
You warm me like a morning sun
Baby you're the only one
Love comes over me
Falling like summer rain
Like summer rain
Pour your love on me
Feeling like summer rain
Like summer rain
Love comes over me
Falling like summer rain
Like summer rain
Pour your love on me
Feeling like summer rain
Like summer rain
Love comes over me
Like summer rain
Love comes over me
Like summer rain
Love comes over me
Like summer rain
Love comes over me
Like summer rain
Love comes over me
Like summer rain
