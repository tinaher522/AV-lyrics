<song artist="Whitesnake" title="If_You_Want_Me_(I'll_Come_Running)">
If you want me baby
If you need me now
If you want me I'll come running
I'll get to you anyhow
If you want my honey
If you need my jam
I'll give you all my sugar baby
I'll give you all that I can
I'll prove to you I'm a man
Come on baby let's get crazy
No need to worry just take my hand
If you'll be my sweet tooth woman
I'll be your sweet loving man
And I'll come running
I'll come running to you
I'll come running
I'll come running running to you
Give me all you sweet kisses
I'll give you all you desire
Give me all your backbone baby
And I'll set your sweet soul on fire
If you want me baby
If you need me now
If you want me I'll come running
I'll get to you anyhow
