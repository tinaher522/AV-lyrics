<song artist="Whitesnake" title="All_I_Want_All_I_Need">
Wherever you go I'll be there
I'll be waiting to care for you
Whatever you want I'll try to give
No matter what I have to do
Through thick and thin I'll be your friend
By your side to the very end
You're all I want all I need
So baby flow like a river to me
'Cause you're all I ever wanted
So come on and bring it to me
You're all I want all I need
And it's more than I could ask for
You're all I want all I need
So much more than I could ask for
I remember the days when we were young
I held your hand like a precious stone
It's still the same nothing's changed
Baby i'll never ever leave you alone
When I look in your eyes I realise
All the love that I'm feeling it's true
And everything that we've been through
Baby it's worth just to be with you
'Cause you're all I ever wanted
So come on and bring it to me
You're all I want all I need
And it's more than I could ask for
You're all I want all I need
You're on my mind all the time I'm living alone
You're on my mind all the time I'm living alone
You're all I want all I need
And it's more than I could ask for
You're all I want all I need
So much more than I could ask for
You're all I want all I need
And it's more than I could ask for
You're all I want, you're all I need
You're all I want all I need
And it's more than I could ask for
You're all I want all I need
You're all I want all I need
