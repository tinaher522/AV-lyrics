<song artist="Whitesnake" title="Need_Your_Love_So_Bad">
I need someone's hand to lead me through the night
I need someone's arms to hold and squeeze me tight
When the night begins, I'm at an end
Because I need your love so bad
Need some lips to feel next to mine
Need someone to stand up and tell me when I'm down
When the lights are low and it's time to go
That's when I need your love so bad
So why don't you get your love and bring it no home to me
Write it on a piece of paper, baby
So it can be sent to me
Try a little tenderness, still trying to remember
Because I need your love so bad
I need someone to talk to me at night
Don't want you to worry, baby
I know we can make everything all right
Listen to my plea, baby
Bring it to me, 'cause I need your love so bad
Because I need your love so bad
