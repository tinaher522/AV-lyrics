<song artist="Whitesnake" title="'Til_The_End_Of_Time">
So far away from you my darling
I feel you way down to my bones
I'm coming home to your good loving
And I'll never ever leave you alone
I will love you deep as the ocean
I will love you till the sun don't shine
I won't rest till you're beside me
I will love you till the end of time
I left my home to seek my fortune
I left you standing in the pouring rain
And now I'm lost so tired and lonely
And I'm just trying to find a way to get back home
