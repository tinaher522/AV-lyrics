<song artist="Whitesnake" title="Got_What_You_Need">
Here I am baby
I'm standing outside your door
You're just what the doctor ordered
and I want more
I'll give you what you want
I'll give you what you need
I'll give you what you want
Make it hard to breathe
When the sun goes down
I feel my temperature rise
I'm a back door man baby
I specialise
I'll give you what you want
I'll give you what you need
I'll give you what you want
Come on make me bleed
I want to be your midnight lover
Spend the night underneath the covers with you
I got what you need I want to be your fancy man
Give you all the good good loving I can
I got what you need
My back street kind of love
Is guaranteed to please
I'm going to work it overtime
Bring you to your knees
I'll give you what you want
I'll give you what you need
I'll give you what you want
I can guarantee
Baby if my sweet sweet loving
Just ain't enough
I'm going to kick down your door
And I'll treat you rough
