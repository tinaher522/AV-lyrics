<song artist="Whitesnake" title="Crying">
I smell trouble
And where there's smoke there must be fire
You sow your seeds of jealousy
And the flames just keep on growing higher
This can't be love any more
I know 'cause I've done everything I can
And all that you can do
I pour gasoline on a burning man
Tears of rage
Tears of pain
Burning my eyes
I realise
I'm crying
Crying
I'm crying
Bitter tears falling like rain
Lies
I can never understand
You play your cards under the table
Dealing me a losing hand
Tears of rage
Tears of pain
Burning my eyes
I realise
I'm crying
Crying
I'm crying
Bitter tears falling like rain
Crying
Always crying
Crying
Bitter tears falling like rain
I want to be there
When your demons come to call
I'm going to finish what you started, baby
Watch you burn little house down
Burn it down, down, down
Then I'll see you crying
Crying
Crying
Bitter tears falling like rain
