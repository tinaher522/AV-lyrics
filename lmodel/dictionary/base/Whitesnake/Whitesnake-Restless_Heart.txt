<song artist="Whitesnake" title="Restless_Heart">
Restless heart, restless mind
I'm tired of wasting, my precious time
There are times in my life I don't know witch way to turn
When everything I touch I get my fingers burned
Dreams to ashes, ashes to dust
When all that glitters is dull with rust
Restless heart, restless mind
I'm tired of wasting my precious time
I'm torn and tattered, shattered and worn
I've had enough trying to live my life in the eye of the storm
Every heartache leaves a scar on my face
Somebody reach out or throw me a line, get me out of this place...
Restless heart, restless mind
I'm tired of wasting, wasting my precious time
Oh, so tired
Restless heart, restless mind
I'm tired of wasting my precious time
Restless heart, restless mind
I'm tired of wasting, wasting all of my precious time
Restless heart, restless mind
So I'm tired of wasting, wasting all of my precious time, time, time
Restless heart
