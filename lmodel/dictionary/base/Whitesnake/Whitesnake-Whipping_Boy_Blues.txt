<song artist="Whitesnake" title="Whipping_Boy_Blues">
I'm crazy 'bout you, baby
it's you that I adore
You keep me riding all night long
Till I can't ride no more
You're insatiable
Anyone can see
I'm going to need a doctor
When you get through with me
I'm crazy 'bout you, baby
Though your heart's as black as coal
I feel the burning deep inside
Your fire down below
You're insatiable
Ain't that the truth
I gave you all my sugar
You got such a sweet tooth
I may be crazy 'bout you, baby
It's you that I adore
I'm crazy 'bout the things you do
But I won't be your whipping boy no more
Your whipping boy no more
I won't be your whipping boy
I'm crazy 'bout you, baby
You really know the score
Over, under, sideways, down
Till I'm crawling on the floor
You're insatiable
You won't let me be
You locked me deep inside your heart
And you threw away the key
I may be crazy 'bout you, baby
It's you that I adore
I'm crazy 'bout the things you do
But I won't be your whipping boy no more
Your whipping boy no more
I won't be your whipping boy
Said I'm crazy 'bout you, baby
it's you that I adore
You keep me riding all night long
Till I can't ride no more
You're insatiable
Ain't that the truth
I gave you all my sugar
You got such a sweet tooth
I may be crazy 'bout you, baby
It's you that I adore
I'm crazy 'bout the things you do
But I won't be your whipping boy no more
Your whipping boy no more
I won't be your whipping boy no more
Your whipping boy no more
Your whipping boy no more
Your whipping boy no more
Your whipping boy no more
Your whipping boy no more
I won't be your
Your whipping boy no more
Your whipping boy no more
Your whipping boy no more
Your whipping boy no more
