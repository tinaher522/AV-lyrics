<song artist="Whitesnake" title="Easier_Said_Than_Done">
You've got my love to keep you warm
Give you shelter from the storm
Any time you need
Through the long and lonely night
You've got me to hold you tight
My love is guaranteed
You're everything I've waited for
Now I don't have to look no more
Take me as I am
I'll do the best I can
For your love
It's easier said than done
Take me by the hand
Try to understand
When I say
It's easier said than done
Sometimes I swim against the tide
But when I know you're by my side
There ain't nothing I can't do
Baby, my heart's an open book
Any time you want to look
'Cause it's written just for you
You're everything I've waited for
Now I don't have to look no more
Take me as I am
I'll do the best I can
For your love
It's easier said than done
Take me by the hand
Try to understand
When I say
It's easier said than done
You're everything I've waited for
Now I don't have to look no more
You're everything I want you to be
Baby, baby, won't you stay with me
Take me as I am
I'll do the best I can
For your love
It's easier said than done
Take me by the hand
Try to understand
When I say
It's easier said than done
It's easier said than done
It's easier said than done
It's easier said than done
It's easier said than done
It's easier said than done
