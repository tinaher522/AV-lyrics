<song artist="Whitesnake" title="Can't_Stop_Now">
My mama always said
If you want you should get in fast
While the going's good
Lie like a rug if you fool around
Just don't get caught with your trousers down
Somebody stop me, tie me down
I tell you, baby, I can't, I can't stop now
My daddy said son gotta understand,
Don't think twice get it while you can
You can't hang around, you can't stand still,
Cos' if you don't take it another man will
Somebody stop me, tie me down
I tell you, baby, I can't, I can't stop now
I got an eye for a pretty girl
And a sweet tooth for trouble
I can't stop, can't stop, can't stop now
I can't stop 'cause it tastes so good
I got a sweet tooth for trouble
No rest for the wicked, no peace of mind
When you got a jukebox heart working overtime
I maybe out of touch, maybe out of line
But, baby, you got your life and I got mine
Somebody stop me, tie me down
I tell you, baby, I can't, I can't stop now
I got an eye for a pretty girl
And a sweet tooth for trouble
I can't stop, can't stop, can't stop now
I got an eye for a pretty girl
And a sweet tooth for trouble
