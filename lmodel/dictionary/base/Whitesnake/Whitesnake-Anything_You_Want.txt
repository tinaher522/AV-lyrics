<song artist="Whitesnake" title="Anything_You_Want">
I need your love to get me through
All the things I want to do
Babe, if you want me to
I'll get on my knees for you
But you got to give me a little sign
You got the same thing on your mind
Every day and every night
Give me the green light
And let it roll, let it ride
I'll be your dog till you're satisfied
I'll be your puppet on a string
'Cause for a spoonful of your sugar I would do anything
Anything you want
Anything you need
Any time at all
It is so hard for you to see
I just love your company
And there ain't nothing I won't do
Just to prove my love to you
And let it roll, let it ride
I'll be your dog till you're satisfied
I'll be your puppet on a string
'Cause for a spoonful of your sugar I would do anything
So, baby, try to understand
I was born to be your man
Don't keep me knocking at your door
Just tell me yes or tell me no
And let it roll, let it ride
I'll be your dog till you're satisfied
I'll be your puppet on a string
'Cause for a spoonful of your sugar I would do anything
Anything you want
Anything you need
