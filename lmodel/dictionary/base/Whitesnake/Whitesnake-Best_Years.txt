<song artist="Whitesnake" title="Best_Years">
Somebody help me
I'm feeling low
I've been down for so long
Donâ€™t know which way to go
Drowning in sorrow
In deep misery
Someone throw me a line
I'm clean out of time
Lord I've got to break free
You came along like a sun in the night
Took me out of the shadows into the light
Caught in a crossfire
Of heartache and pain
Searching so many years
Through a river of tears
Always shot down in flames
You came along like a sun in the night
Took me out of the shadows into the light
Now these are the best years
Truly the best years of my life
The best years of my life
Bad luck and trouble
Every day of my life
Every lonely lonely night
Like a cold hearted twist of the knife
You came along like a sun in the night
Took me out of the shadows into the light
Now these are the best years
Truly the best years of my life
The best years of my life
Somebody help me
I'm feeling low
I've been down so long
Babe I've got to let go
You came along like a sun in the night
Took me out of the shadows into the light
Now these are the best years
Truly the best years of my life
The best years of my life
