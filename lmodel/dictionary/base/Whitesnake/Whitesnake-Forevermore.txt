<song artist="Whitesnake" title="Forevermore">
Looking back across the years
The good times and the bad
All echo in my mind
Whispered on the breeze
Sweet and bitter memories
Of all I left behind
If it wasn’t for your love
I don’t know where I’d be
I don’t know what I’d do
Time and time again
I sing the same refrain
It’s all because of you
For you will be my love
And I will feel your heartbeat
Forevermore
Rest here in my arms
Forevermore
Forevermore
Through the dark night of my soul
You gave me a hand to hold
And helped me make it through
Now all my doubts and all my fears
I held inside for all those years
Disappear when I’m with you
For you will be my love
And I will feel your heartbeat
Forevermore
Rest here in my arms
Give me all your love
Give me all your love
I’ll be in your loving arms
Forevermore
For you will be my love
And I will feel your heartbeat
Forevermore
Rest here in my arms
Give me all your love
Give me all your love
I’ll be in your loving arms
Give me all your love
Give me all your love
Give me all your love
I’ll be in your loving arms
Give me all your love
Forevermore
Forevermore
Forevermore
Forevermore
Forevermore
Forevermore
