<song artist="Whitesnake" title="Woman_Trouble_Blues">
The woman's name was trouble, she put the blame on me
I asked her what her game was, she said "Misery"
I didn't ask no questions, I did not even pray
When the angel on my shoulder said I should walk away
You promised me heaven but you gave me hell
Cut me down to the bone with your kiss and tell
Nobody listens to a word I say,
Still I'm going to curse you, woman, till my dying day 
I should have known better with a girl like you
You shame the devil with the things you do
I was blind, now I see
A lying woman be the death of me
I got woman trouble blues
Woman trouble blues 
You told me it was meant to be
But all you did was put the hurt on me
You made my life a living hell
And drowned my dreams in the wishing well
I've got woman trouble blues
Woman trouble blues
There ain't no doubt
I'm going down 
The woman's name was trouble, she put the blame on me,
I gave her what she wanted and I got misery
Now I don't take much persuading, at times I'm easily led
I'm going to find myself in a prison cell through the lying things she said
I'll stand accused on judgement day
And pray the lord hears what I say
All my life I never learned
I played with fire and I got burned
Woman trouble blues
I got woman trouble blues
Woman trouble blues
Mean old woman trouble blues
