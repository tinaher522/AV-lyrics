<song artist="Whitesnake" title="Judgement_Day">
The night is gone, the time has come
To find a new day has begun
And it promises to stay
To soothe the pain of wasted years
And kiss away the bitter tears
Love to light the way
And from the darkness comes a smile
That reaches out for many miles
Touching everyone
No more shadows of the past
Your spirit's free to fly at last
Shining in the sun
Like rolling thunder
I feel the power of love
It's a gift from Heaven
And the Lord above
We walk toward desire
Hand and hand, through fields of fire
With only love to light the way
On the road to Judgement Day
Take it easy, take it slow
I'll take you anywhere you wanna go
Places never seen before
'Cause I love you and I need you
I'll do my best to please you
My love can open any door
When you hear the thunder
In your darkest night
I'll be there to hold you
When the lightning strikes
So don't you worry
You can ease your mind
'Cause we'll still be dancing
At the end of time
Who loves you, who needs you
Who'll do his best to please you
I love you and I need you
I'll get down on my knees
We walk toward desire
Hand and hand, through fields of fire
With only love to light the way
On the road to Judgement Day
So don't you worry, baby
On the road to Judgement Day, ooh
Who loves you, who needs you
On the road to Judgement Day
So I love you and I need you
My love can open any door
My love can open any door
