<song artist="Whitesnake" title="Girl">
I have never known a woman
who loves me like you do
You treat me like a dog
and make me shake my tail for you
I know the game you're playin'
when you're turnin' all your tricks
It's written on your face
You just want your business fixed
Now I don't need a crystal ball
to see what's in your mind
If I don't give you what you want
you treat me so unkind
if I'm good and give you love
You throw me down a bone
but if I'm bad, you make me sad
and leave my love alone
Pretty little crazy white girl
Just a pretty little crazy white girl
Pretty little crazy white girl
Girl
I know baby you ain't foolin'
with all your high class schoolin'
you want everything your own way
If I could, I would
do every little thing a good man should
Baby, I'd really give it to ya every day
Whoo!
Pretty little crazy white girl
Just a pretty little crazy white girl
Pretty little crazy white girl
Mean mistreater
There ain't no one to beat ya
but you treat me so bad
I have never known a woman
who loves me like you do
you treat me like a dog
and still I shake my tail for you
Pretty little crazy white girl
Just a pretty little crazy white girl
Pretty little crazy white girl
Girl
you treat me so bad
I love the way you make me
