<song artist="Whitesnake" title="All_Out_Of_Luck">
Here I sit a broken hearted man
Lady luck dealt me a losing hand
So what's a man like me to do
I'm still a fool in love with you
I gave you all the love I had to give
And you took away my reason left to live
I feel I'm running out of time
And I just want to make you mine, make you mine
Take me home tonight
Make me feel all right
All out of luck
Clean out of time
All out of luck
Drive me out of my mind, baby
I gambled with my heart and paid the price
I threw it all away on a roll of the dice
I tried to play the king of hearts
Now I'm the joker, torn apart, ooh, baby
Take me home tonight
Make me feel all right
All out of luck
Clean out of time
All out of luck
Drive me out of my mind
So here I sit a broken hearted man
Lady luck dealt me a losing hand
So what's a man like me to do
I'm still a fool in love with you, in love with you
Take me home tonight
Make me feel all right
All out of luck
Clean out of time
All out of luck
Drive me out of my mind
All out of luck
Clean out of time
All out of luck
Drive me out of my mind
All out of luck
Clean out of time
All out of luck
Clean out of time
All out of luck
Clean out of time
