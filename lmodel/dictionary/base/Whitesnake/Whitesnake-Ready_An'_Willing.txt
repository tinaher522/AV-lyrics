<song artist="Whitesnake" title="Ready_An'_Willing">
I wanna be loved
Don't wanna be teased
I don't want no woman
Getting down on her knees
I'm ready an' willing
To reach for the sun
So I can get me some loving
'Fore I'm gone
I want more, more, more, more
I want some more of that
Sweet satisfaction to soothe my soul
I want you to rock me
All night long
Rope an' ride me, baby
Do me wrong
Roll me over
Make be bleed
I'd dance with the devil
To get what I need
I need more, more, more, more
I need some more of that
Sweet satisfaction to soothe my soul
I get this crazy feeling inside my soul
And it's driving me insane
I get this crazy feeling
Can you feel it, baby
It's driving me out of my mind
I'm talking about sweet satisfaction
I'm ready an' willing, sweet satisfaction
I'm ready an' willing, sweet satisfaction
Sweet satisfaction, I'm ready an' willing
I get this crazy feeling inside my soul
And it's driving me insane
I get this crazy feeling
Can you feel it, baby?
It's driving me out of my mind
I keep on looking for sweet satisfaction
I'm ready an' willing, sweet satisfaction
I'm ready an' willing, sweet satisfaction
I keep on looking, sweet satisfaction
I keep on looking, sweet satisfaction
I'm ready an' willing, sweet satisfaction
I'm ready an' willing, sweet satisfaction
I keep on looking, sweet satisfaction
I'm ready an' willing, sweet satisfaction
I'm ready an' willing, sweet satisfaction
I keep on looking, sweet satisfaction
