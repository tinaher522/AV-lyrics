<song artist="Whitesnake" title="As_Long_As_I_Have_You">
I didn't mean to cause you pain
If you'd have me back again
I'd be happy, never blue
As long as I have you
And I get so lonely in the night
I need you to hold me tight
Doesn't matter what you do
As long as I have you
As long as I have you
And I don't want to live in misery
Only you can set me free
All my dreams will come true
As long as I have you
As long as I have you
As long as I have you
Every morning I wake up
Wipe the tears from my eyes
Just as long as we make up
I don't mind, I don't mind
As long as I have you
Oh, my soul
I didn't mean to cause you pain
If you'd have me back again
I'd be happy, never blue
As long as I have you
As long as I have you
As long as I have you
As long as I have you
Every morning I wake up
Wipe the tears from my eyes
Just as long as we make up
I don't mind, I don't mind
As long as I have you
As long as I have you
As long as I have you
As long as I have you
As long as I have you
As long as I have you
As long as I have you
Just as long as I have you
As long as I have you
