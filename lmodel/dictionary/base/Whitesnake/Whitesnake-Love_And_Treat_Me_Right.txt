<song artist="Whitesnake" title="Love_And_Treat_Me_Right">
I get high when I'm feeling low
Just thinking about the things you do
I don't mind playing your nasty games
As long as I can be with you
I'm your loving man
Give you love every day
You're my lover
Come on, baby, take me home tonight
Come on, baby, make me feel all right
Come on, baby, take me home with you tonight
Love and treat me right
Lord above, I'm a slave to love
And, baby, you can do no wrong
I'll be your monkey man, I'll be your dog
Howling for you all night long
I'm your loving man
Give you love every day
You're my lover
Come on, baby, take me home tonight
Come on, baby, make me feel all right
Come on, baby, take me home with you tonight
Love and treat me right
Treat me right
Come on, baby, take me home tonight
Come on, baby, make me feel all right
Come on, baby, take me home with you tonight
Love and treat me right
Come on, baby, take me home tonight
Treat me right
Come on, baby, make me feel all right
Feel all right
Come on, baby, take me home with you tonight
Love and treat me right
Come on and treat me right
Come on, baby, take me home tonight
Come on, baby, make me feel all right
Come on, baby, take me home with you tonight
Love and treat me right
