<song artist="Whitesnake" title="We_Wish_You_Well">
I'm sad to say, it's time to  go
But until we meet again along the road
Remember this on your journey home
When you hear the thunder roar, you're not alone
We wish you well
We wish you well
In times of trouble, may your heart be strong
We wish you well
We wish you well
Until we meet again
We wish you well
