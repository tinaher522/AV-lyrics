<song artist="Foo_Fighters" title="The_Neverending_Sigh">
Woe, it's me
The end is near
Thought you'd never leave
Heart and teeth
Just to taste bittersweet
One last stain to get beneath the skin
Beneath the skin
The wish is drawn inside
The neverending sigh
No one lets everyone in
No one lets everyone in
My exit, no exit
No one lets everyone in
Me and you
Draw the line
Now it's time they move
Face to face
Damn the luck messes with me
Heaven, what's come over me?
The wishes come inside
The neverending sigh
No one lets everyone in
No one lets everyone in
My exit, no exit
Go on let everyone in
No one lets everyone in
No one lets everyone in
No one lets everyone in
My exit, no exit
Go on let everyone in
No one lets everyone in
