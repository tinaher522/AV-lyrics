<song artist="Foo_Fighters" title="Friend_Of_A_Friend">
He needs a quiet room
with a lock to keep him in
its just a quiet room
and he's there
he plays an old guitar
with a coin found by the phone
it was his friends guitar
that he played
hmm mmm mmm
he's never been in love
but he knows just what love is
he says never mind
and no one speaks
he thinks he drinks too much
cause when he tells his two best friends
I think I drink too much
no one speaks
no one speaks
no one speaks
hmm hmm mmm mmm mmm hmm hmm mmm
he plays an old guitar
with a coin found by the phone
it was his friends guitar
that he played
when he plays
no one speaks
no one speaks
and he plays
no one speaks.
