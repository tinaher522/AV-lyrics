<song artist="Foo_Fighters" title="Planet_Claire">
Ahhhahhahhahh
She came from Planet Claire
I knew she came from there
She drove a Plymouth Satellite
Faster than the speed of light
Planet Claire has pink air
All the trees are red
No one ever dies there
No one has a head
Ahhhahhhahhahh
Some say she's from Mars
Or one of the seven stars
That shine after 3:30 in the morning
Well she isn't
Ahhhahhhahhahhahhahh
