<song artist="Foo_Fighters" title="Cold_Day_In_The_Sun">
Take a high dive into your brain
And you make your lonely course
You just might wear your welcome out if you don't let it go.
There's nothing that you couldn't say
'Cause you said it all before
Think it's time you walk this lonely road all on your own
It's your cold day in the sun
Looks like your bleeding heart
Has already won
Wish I could take it away
And save you from yourself
You get so lost inside your head like no one else
Looking for someone to blame
Blame me all along
You'll take the heat, but you would never take the fall
It's your cold day in the sun
Looks like your bleeding heart
Has already won
You're so afraid
That you are the only one
That you are the only one
You know
But don't be afraid
Cause your not the only one
You're not the only one
I know
It's your cold day in the sun
Looks like your bleeding heart
Has already won
It's your cold day in the sun
Looks like your bleeding heart
Has already won
