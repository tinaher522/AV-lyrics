<song artist="Foo_Fighters" title="Wheels">
One, two, three, four
I know what you're thinkin'
B-1 goin' down
I could feel us sinkin'
But then I came around
And everyone I've loved before
Flashed before my eyes
And nothin' mattered anymore
I looked into the sky
Well I wanted something better, man
I wished for something new
And I wanted something beautiful
I wished for something true
Been lookin' for a reason, man
Something to lose
When the wheels come down (When the wheels come down)
When the wheels touch ground (When the wheels touch ground)
And you feel like it's all over
There's another round for you
When the wheels come down (When the wheels come down)
Know your head is spinnin'
Broken hearts will mend
This is our beginning
Comin' to an end
Well, you wanted something better, man
You wished for something new
Well, you wanted something beautiful
You wished for something true
Been lookin' for a reason, man
Something to lose
When the wheels come down (When the wheels come down)
When the wheels touch ground (When the wheels touch ground)
And you feel like it's all over
There's another round for you
When the wheels come down (When the wheels come down)
When the wheels come down (When the wheels come down)
When the wheels touch ground (When the wheels touch ground)
And you feel like it's all over
There's another round for you
When the wheels come down (When the wheels come down)
When the wheels come down (When the wheels come down)
When the wheels touch ground (When the wheels touch ground)
And you feel like it's all over
There's another round for you
When the wheels come down (When the wheels come down)
