<song artist="Foo_Fighters" title="Miss_The_Misery">
Oh, oh
If I had my way
If I had to lose
Wouldn’t take back one thing
Never had much to choose
Then it dawned on me
Coming down on you
Like a cold sky raining
Under a burning moon
Waiting all your life, your wish is coming true
Bless your heart for beating, me right out of you
Miss the misery
Need a reason for a change
Need a reason to explain
So turn it on again
Don’t change your mind
You’re wasting light
Get in and let’s go, go
What a nice long leash
What a nice tight noose
Never worked for me, but
Sure it'll look good on you
Been waiting all your life, your wish is coming true
Bless your heart for beating, me right out of you
Miss the misery
Need a reason for a change
Need a reason to refrain
So turn it on again
Don’t change your mind
You’re wasting light
Get in and let’s go, go
Miss the misery
Give me reason for a change
Miss the misery
Give me reason to refrain
Missed your misery today
Missed your misery today
Come on and turn it on for me
Don't change your mind
You’re wasting light
Don’t make this right
Don’t make this right
Get in and let’s go
Go
