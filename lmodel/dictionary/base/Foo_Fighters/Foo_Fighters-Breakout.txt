<song artist="Foo_Fighters" title="Breakout">
You make me dizzy, running circles in my head
One of these days I'll chase you down
Well look who's going crazy now, we're face to face my friend
Better get out, better get out
You know you make me breakout
Make me breakout
I don't wanna look like that
I don't wanna look like that
Know you make me breakout
Make me breakout
I don't wanna look like that
I don't wanna look like that
Know you make me breakout
You can see this on my face, it's all for you
The more and more I take, I break right through
Now therapy still scares me, put me on my back again
I may be crazy, little frayed around the ends
One of these days I'll phase you out
Burn it in the blast off, burn it in the blast off
Watching me crawl away
Try to get out, try to get out
You know you make me breakout
Make me breakout
I don't wanna look like that
I don't wanna look like that
Know you make me breakout
Make me breakout
I don't wanna look like that
I don't wanna look like that, yeah yeah
I don't wanna look like that
Breakout
Breakout
Breakout
Breakout
Go, go, go
You know you make me breakout
Make me breakout
I don't wanna look like that
I don't wanna look like that
Know you make me breakout
Make me breakout
I don't wanna look like that
I don't wanna look like that, yeah yeah
I don't wanna look like that
I don't wanna look like that
Know you make me breakout
Make me breakout
Make me breakout, yeah
