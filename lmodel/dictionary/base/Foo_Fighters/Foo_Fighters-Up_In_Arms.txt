<song artist="Foo_Fighters" title="Up_In_Arms">
The rain is here and you, my dear
Are still my friend
It's true the two of us are back as one again
I was the one who left you
Always coming back I cannot forget you girl
Now I am up in arms again
The rain is here and you, my dear
Are still my friend
It's true the two of us are back as one again
I was the one who left you
Always coming back I cannot forget you girl
Now I am up in arms again
Together now I don't know how this love could end
My lonely heart it falls apart
For you to mend
I was the one who left you
Always coming back I cannot forget you girl
Now I am up in arms again
I was the one who left you
Always coming back I cannot forget you girl
Now I am up in arms again
I was the one who left you
Always coming back I cannot forget you girl
Now I am up in arms again
