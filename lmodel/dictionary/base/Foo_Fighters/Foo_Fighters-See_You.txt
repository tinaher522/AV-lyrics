<song artist="Foo_Fighters" title="See_You">
These notes are marked "return to sender"
I'll save this letter for myself
I wish you only knew
How good it is to see you
See you, see you, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
These steps I take don't get me anywhere
I'm getting further from myself
One thing is always true
How good it is to see you
See you, see you, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
I'm done resenting you
You represented me so well
And this I promise you
How could I end up in the hands of someone else
These notes are marked "return to sender"
I'll save this letter for myself
I wish you only knew
How good it is to see you
See you, see you
See you, see you
See you, see you
See you, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
