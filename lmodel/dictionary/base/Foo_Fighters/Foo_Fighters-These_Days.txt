<song artist="Foo_Fighters" title="These_Days">
One of these days the ground will drop
Out from beneath your feet
One of these days your heart will stop
And play its final beat
One of these days the clocks will stop
And time won't mean a thing
One of these days their bombs will drop
And silence everything
But it's alright
Yeah, it's alright
I said, it's alright
Easy for you to say
Your heart has never been broken
Your pride has never been stolen
Not yet, not yet
One of these days
I bet your heart'll be broken
I bet your pride'll be stolen
I'll bet, I'll bet, I'll bet, I'll bet
One of these days
One of these days
One of these days your eyes will close
And pain will disappear
One of these days you will forget
To hope and learn to fear
But it's alright
Yeah, it's alright
I said, it's alright
Easy for you to say
Your heart has never been broken
Your pride has never been stolen
Not yet, not yet
One of these days
I bet your heart'll be broken
I bet your pride'll be stolen
I'll bet, I'll bet, I'll bet, I'll bet
One of these days
One of these days
But it's alright
Yeah, it's alright
Said, it's alright
Yeah, it's alright
Don't say it's alright
Don't say it's alright
Don't say it's alright
One of these days your heart will stop
And play its final beat
But it's alright
Easy for you to say
Your heart has never been broken
Your pride has never been stolen
Not yet, not yet
One of these days
I bet your heart'll be broken
I bet your pride'll be stolen
I'll bet, I'll bet, I'll bet, I'll bet
One of these days
One of these days
One of these days
