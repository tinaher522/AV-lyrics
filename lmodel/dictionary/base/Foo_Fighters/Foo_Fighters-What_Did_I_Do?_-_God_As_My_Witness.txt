<song artist="Foo_Fighters" title="What_Did_I_Do?_-_God_As_My_Witness">
There you go again putting words into my mouth
This one's for you to know and for me to find out
All that troublin' you're on about
How you gonna know till you hear it out loud?
Stop, ask myself what did I do?
What did I do to deserve you?
Go on, tell me now what did I do?
What did I do to deserve you?
I heard every word coming from the thirteenth floor
Your song came along, heard the voices tell me
To save yourself
Oh, behave yourself
I stop, ask myself what did I do?
What can I do to preserve you?
Go on, tell me now what did I do?
What can I do to conserve you?
Your name, Uruthane, I can see the writing on the wall
Come on, flip the coin, bet it's gonna tell you
To save yourself
Ah, behave yourself
Your man channelin' know him by the X on his hand
You raised runaways singing at the gate
To save yourself
Ah, behave yourself
So here I go again putting words into your mouth
This one's for me to know and for you to find out
All that troublin' I'm on about
How you gonna know till you heard it out loud?
All your heroes, where are they now?
I'm lost, deliver me
I crossed the river finally
God as my witness, yeah it's gonna heal my soul tonight
God as my witness, yeah it's gonna heal my soul tonight
God as my witness, yeah it's gonna heal my soul tonight
God as my witness, yeah you're gonna heal my soul tonight
God as my witness, yeah you're gonna heal my soul tonight
