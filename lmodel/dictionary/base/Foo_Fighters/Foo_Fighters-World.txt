<song artist="Foo_Fighters" title="World">
When all is said and done
And the air we breathe is not enough
To keep these broken wings, floating
Carry on into the sun, into the sun
On into the sun
On into the sun
Looking down at you, sleeping
From above, I love
Looking down at you, weeping
From above, my love
Over and over again 
I ride the wheel that turns
Over and over again 
I find the soul that burns
And if it has no end 
The lonely heart that learns
Over and over again 
I ride the wheel that turns
When all is dead and gone
And the air we breathe is not enough
To keep these dying arms, see them
Carry on into the sun, into the sun
I'm not the only one
I'm not the only one
Heaven skies are reelin'
And my hand that holds the world
Deep inside i'm reachin'
Into the universe
Over and over again 
I ride the wheel that turns
Over and over again 
I find the soul that burns
And if it has no end 
The lonely heart that learns
Over and over again 
I ride the wheel that turns
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
Over and over again 
I ride the wheel that turns
Over and over again 
i find the soul that burns
And if it has no end 
The lonely heart that learns
Over and over again 
I ride the wheel that turns
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
Over and over again 
I ride the wheel that turns
Over and over again 
i find the soul that burns
