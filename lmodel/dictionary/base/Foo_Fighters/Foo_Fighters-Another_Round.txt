<song artist="Foo_Fighters" title="Another_Round">
When she goes storming out
I run for cover
Rolling like thunder clouds,
Hanging above her
Ringing the witching hour
Spells that im singing
Rain come and drown me out
Sinking deep below
Can you go another round
I will follow you down and out
Let's go another round
I will follow you down and 
We could just lay around
Stare at the ceiling
Want to forget about
One for the feeling
Room full of photographs
Box full of letters
Come on make it last
Nothing else matters right now
Can you go another round
I will follow you down and out
Let's go another round
I will follow you down and out
Instrumental
Can you go another round
I will follow you down and out
Let's go another round
I will follow you down and out
Let's go another round
I will bother you down and out
Let's go another round
I will follow you down and out
uhhh... uhhh...
