<song artist="Foo_Fighters" title="Wattershed">
I stick it to the mailman
I'm pinned against a pot plant
I'm sick of all the sun-tan
Oily with the ray-ban
Take that to the bank and call it a check
Masked without a weapon
I'm skinny as a spit pan
Dealing with the shit plan
Playing with my bad hand
Just another rock band
Take that to the man
and call it a check
Trapped within a contract
Hey there boy while you were catching the black widow
The rest of us were watching Melrose
I wanna swim in the watershed
I wanna listen to the flowerhead
I lost a gallon and still I bled
I keep on thinking I get ahead
Pissed at all the disc jam
Pissed about the 5-ham
Pissed about the green state
I miss it and I can't wait
Take that to the man and call it a check
Trapped within a contract
Hey man can't you tell it's still a problem?
See you at the devil's tower
I wanna swim in the watershed
I wanna listen to the flowerhead
I lost a gallon and still I bled
I keep on thinking I get ahead
Pissed at all the disc jam
Pissed about the 5-ham
Pissed about the green state
I miss it and I can't wait
