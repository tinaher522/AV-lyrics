<song artist="Foo_Fighters" title="Dear_Rosemary">
You got away, got away, got away from me
Now get away, get away, get away from me
I couldn't grow just living in a shadow
Where do you go when no one's following you?
You ran away, ran away, it was right on cue
Shall I go on
And on
And on
And on
And on
And on again?
Rosemary, you're part of me, you know
You are, you are, you are
Rosemary, you're part of me, you know
You are, you are, you are
Rosemary, please pardon me
Truth ain't gonna change the way you lie
Youth ain't gonna change the way you die
Dear Rosemary
Dear Rosemary
You got away, got away, got away with things
You got away, got away, got away with things
False starts young hearts get shattered
Pick up the pieces coming down around you
You ran away, ran away, it was right on cue
Can I go on
And on
And on
And on
And on
And on again?
Rosemary, you're part of me, you know
You are, you are, you are
Rosemary, you're part of me, you know
You are, you are, you are
Rosemary, please pardon me
Truth ain't gonna change the way you lie
Youth ain't gonna change the way you die
This was no ordinary life
(This was no ordinary life)
This was no ordinary lie
(This was no ordinary lie)
I'm here from now on
But once I'm gone
I'm gone
Truth ain't gonna change the way you lie
Youth ain't gonna change the way you die
Dear Rosemary (Dear Rosemary)
You're part of me (you're part of me)
Dear Rosemary (Dear Rosemary)
Please pardon me (Please pardon me)
Dear Rosemary
You got away, got away, got away from me
Now get away, get away, get away from me
