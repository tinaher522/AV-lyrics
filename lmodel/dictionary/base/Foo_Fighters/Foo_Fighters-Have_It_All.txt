<song artist="Foo_Fighters" title="Have_It_All">
You're my size I need to try you on
Someone in between the right and wrong
Through everything you kept your wings apart
Through everything you stayed the same old heart
(chorus)
And when I've had enough
She drains me, when I'm empty
She fills herself she takes it all
In too deep, she's spilling over me
In too deep, she's spilling over me
Go on and have it all
Winding through this maze you hold me in
Searching all these days to find the end
You're everything, you're everything I'm not
But I'm anything I'm anyone you want
(chorus)
Have it all
Have it all
You're everything, you're everything I'm not
I'm anything, I'm anyone you want
(chorus
In too deep she's spilling over me
In too deep she's spilling over me
In too deep she's spilling over me
In too deep she's spilling over me
Have it all
