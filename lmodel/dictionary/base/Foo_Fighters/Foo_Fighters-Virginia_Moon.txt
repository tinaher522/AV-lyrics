<song artist="Foo_Fighters" title="Virginia_Moon">
Dearest constellation
Heaven surrounding you
Stay there soft and blue
Virginia moon
I'll wait for you tonight
Sweetest invitation
Breaking the day in two
Feeling like I do
Virginia moon
I'll wait for you tonight
And now shades become shadows in your light
In the morning when we're through
And tomorrow rescues you
I will say goodnight
Secret fascination
Whisper a quiet tune
Hear me calling you
Virginia moon
I'll wait for you tonight
And now shades become shadows in your light
In the morning when we're through
And tomorrow rescues you
I will say goodnight
Virginia moon
I'll wait for you tonight
And now shades become shadows in your light
In the morning when we're through
And tomorrow rescues you
I will say goodnight
I will say goodnight
I will say goodnight
