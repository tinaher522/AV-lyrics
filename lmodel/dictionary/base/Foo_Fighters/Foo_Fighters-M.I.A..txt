<song artist="Foo_Fighters" title="M.I.A.">
Call and I'll answer at home in the lost and found
You say that I'm much too proud
Someone who's taking pleasure in breaking down
Nevermind the mannequins, drunk in their hollow town,
Drinking their spoils down, cheap imitations
The revelation is now.
Yeah, you won't find me I'm going M.I.A.
Tonight I'm leaving going M.I.A.
Getting lost in you again is better than being numb
Counting every minute till the feeling comes crashing down
Run when it hit's the ground, I'm good at escaping
But better at flaking out
Calling unanswered the center becomes blown out
Stuck on the inside now
It's fear I'm embracing
I never could face you down
Yeah, you won't find me I'm going M.I.A.
Tonight I'm leaving going M.I.A.
Getting lost in you again is better than being numb
Red, red, laced around your head
Cold and rescued (x6)
Call and I'll answer at home in the lost and found
You say that I'm much too proud
Someone who's taking pleasure in breaking down
Yeh, you won't find me I'm going M.I.A.
Tonight I'm leaving going M.I.A.
So you don't find me I'm going M.I.A.
Tonight I'm leaving going M.I.A.
Say good-bye to me I'm going M.I.A.
I can find relief I'm going M.I.A.
Getting lost in you again is better than being numb
Better than playing dumb
