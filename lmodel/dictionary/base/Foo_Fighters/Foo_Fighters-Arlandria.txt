<song artist="Foo_Fighters" title="Arlandria">
Ain't that the way it always starts?
A simple round of conversation
Became a shameful equation
I flipped you station to station
Hey
Don't go and turn the other way
Don't say there's nothin' more to say
Come on, hear me out
Hush, hush, settle down
Button up, don't make a sound
Shame, shame, go away
Come again some other day
You used to say I couldn't save you enough
So I've been savin' it up, I started savin' it up
And when you said I couldn't give you enough
I started givin' you up, I started givin' you up
You are not me, Arlandria, Arlandria
You and what army, Arlandria, Arlandria?
Oh, God you gotta make it stop
Chase all of those memories away
Save them all for another day
Don't you remember it was rain that drowned you?
Wait
I wanna see if you can change
I wanna keep all I can take
I feel much better now
Use me up, spit me out
Let me be your hand-me-down
Fame, fame, go away
Come again some other day
You used to say I couldn't save you enough
So I've been savin' it up, I started savin' it up
And when you said I couldn't give you enough
I started givin' you up, I started givin' you up
You are not me, Arlandria, Arlandria
You and what army, Arlandria, Arlandria?
Oh God, you gotta make it stop
My sweet Virginia
I'm the same as I was in your arms
My sweet Virginia
I'm the same as I was in your arms
Shame, shame go away
Come again some other day
Memories keep haunting me
Help me chase them all away
Hush, now settle down
Button up, don't make a sound
Close your eyes, turn around
Help me burn this to the ground
Come now, take the blame
That's okay, I'll play the game
I don't care it's all the same
Watch it all go up in flames
Chew me up, spit me out
Let me be your hand-me-down
Fame, fame, go away
Come again some other day
You used to say I couldn't save you enough
So I've been savin' it up, I started savin' it up
And when you said I couldn't give you enough
I started givin' you up, I started givin' you up
You are not me, Arlandria, Arlandria
You and what army, Arlandria, Arlandria?
Oh God, you gotta make it stop
My sweet Virginia
Oh God, you gotta make it stop
My sweet Virginia
Oh God, you gotta make it stop
