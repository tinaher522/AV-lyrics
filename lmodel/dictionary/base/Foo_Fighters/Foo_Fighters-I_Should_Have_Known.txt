<song artist="Foo_Fighters" title="I_Should_Have_Known">
I should have known
That it would end this way
I should have known
There was no other way
Didn't hear your warning
Damn my heart gone deaf
I should have known
Look at the shape you're in
I should have known
But I dove right in
One thing is for certain
As I'm standing here
I should have known
Lay your hands in mine
Heal me one last time
Though I cannot forgive you yet
No, I cannot forgive you yet
To leave my heart in debt
I should have known
I was inside of you
I should have known
There was that side of you
Came without a warning
Caught me unaware
I should have known
I've been here before
I should have known
Don't want it anymore
One thing is for certain
I'm still standing here
I should have known
Lay your hands in mine
Feel me one last time
Though I cannot forgive you yet
No, I cannot forgive you yet
To leave my heart in debt
No, I cannot forgive you yet
No, I cannot forgive you yet
To leave my heart in debt
I should have known
Maybe you were right
Didn't wanna fight
I should have known
Couldn't read the signs
Couldn't see the light
I should have known
Though I cannot forgive you yet
No, I cannot forgive you yet
To leave my heart in debt
No, I cannot forgive you yet
No, I cannot forgive you yet
To leave my heart in debt
No, I cannot forgive you yet
No, I cannot forgive you yet
To leave this all in debt
I should have known
