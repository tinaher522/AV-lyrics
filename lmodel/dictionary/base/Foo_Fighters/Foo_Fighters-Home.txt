<song artist="Foo_Fighters" title="Home">
Wish I were with you, but I couldn't stay
Every direction leads me away
Pray for tomorrow, but for today
All I want
Is to be home
Stand in the mirror, you look the same
Just looking for shelter from the cold and the pain
Someone to cover, safe from the rain
And all I want
Is to be home
The echoes and silence, patience and grace
All of these moments I'll never replace
No fear of my heart, absence of faith
All I want
Is to be home
People I've loved, I have no regrets
Some I remember, some I forget
Some of them living, some of them dead
All I want
Is to be home.
