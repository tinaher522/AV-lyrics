<song artist="Foo_Fighters" title="What_If_I_Do">
Back and forth that voice of yours
Keeps me up at night
Help me search to find the words
That eat you up inside
I go side to side like the wildest tides
In your hurricane
And I only hide what is on my mind
Because I can't explain
What if I do, love?
What if I don't?
I'd have to lose everything just to find you
What if I do, love?
What if I don't
I'd have to lose everything just to find you
It's my turn, this soul won't burn
So throw me in the fire
Trophies earned and lessons learned
And wicked little lies
We can pave new roads with the cold gravestones
Wind them through the pines
Should I stay or should I go alone?
I cannot decide
What if I do, love?
What if I don't?
I'd have to lose everything just to find you
What if I do, love?
What if I don't
I'd have to lose everything just to find you
Carolina, Caroline
Carolina, Caroline
What if I do, love?
What if I don't?
I'd have to lose everything just to find you
What if I do, love?
What if I don't
I'd have to lose everything just to find you
Carolina, Caroline
Carolina, Caroline
Carolina, Caroline
Carolina, Caroline.
