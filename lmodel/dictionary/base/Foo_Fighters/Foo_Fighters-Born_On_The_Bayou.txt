<song artist="Foo_Fighters" title="Born_On_The_Bayou">
Now when I was just a little boy standin' to my Daddy's knee
My Poppa said, son, don't let the man get you, do what he done to me
'Cause he'll get you, 'cause he'll get you now, now
I can remember the fourth of July
Runnin' through the backwood bare
And I can still hear my old hound dog barkin'
Chasin' down a hoodoo there
Chasin' down a hoodoo there
Born on the bayou
Born on the bayou
Born on the bayou
Wish I was back on the bayou rollin' with some Cajun Queen
Wishin' I were a fast freight train
Oh, just a-chooglin' on down to New Orleans
Born on the bayou
Born on the bayou
Born on the bayou.
I can remember the fourth of July
Runnin' through the backwood bare
And I can still hear my old hound dog barkin'
Chasin' down a hoodoo there
Chasin' down a hoodoo there
Born on the bayou
Born on the bayou
Born on the bayou
