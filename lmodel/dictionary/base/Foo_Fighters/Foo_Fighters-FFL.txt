<song artist="Foo_Fighters" title="FFL">
Ready aim fire
No ones fuckin' 'round standin in the line
You gotta feel it right between the eyes
Time is runnin' out time to do it right now
My oh my
Everything's gonna be fine
My oh my
Fat Fucking Lie
Let yourself go, let me test your fate 
Make your hair grow, make your legs shake
Dance to the sound of heartache
My oh my
Everything's gonna be fine
My oh my
Fat Fucking Lie
Fat fucking Lie
Get on your bikes and ride
My oh my
Everything's gonna be fine
My oh my
Fat Fucking Lie
Fat Fucking Lie
