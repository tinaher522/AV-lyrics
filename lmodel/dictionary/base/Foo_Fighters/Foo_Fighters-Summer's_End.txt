<song artist="Foo_Fighters" title="Summer's_End">
Early morning, without warning 
Woke me with a scare 
I had that dream again 
That the sun was dead 
Make me warm or take me home
It's so cold in here
Can't we meet somewhere?
Is it winter there?
Is it winter there?
This winter
Meet me in the summertime
We can move the air
Sweet Virginia countryside
I will meet you there
Blood and lips and cherry wine
Moonshine in your hair
Just keep staring at the sun
Pray for summer's end
Come on over, brave my storm
Ocean's overhead
Come inside, my friend 
Getting bad out there 
Every moment, we have stolen 
All we had to share 
No one wanted them
But you know I did 
You know I did 
This moment
Meet me in the summertime
We can move the air
Sweet Virginia countryside
I will meet you there
Blood and lips and cherry wine
Moonshine in your hair
Just keep staring at the sun
Pray for summer's end
Meet me in the summertime
We can move the air
Sweet Virginia countryside
I will meet you there
Blood and lips and cherry wine
Moonshine in your hair
Just keep staring at the sun
Pray for summer's end
Meet me in the summertime
Meet me in the summertime
Meet me in the summertime
We can move the air
Meet me in the summertime
I will meet you there
