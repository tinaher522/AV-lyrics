<song artist="Foo_Fighters" title="Outside">
There you are dancing at your altar
Beautiful earthling
Dressed in cashmere
All of your sound echoes through the canyons
Down below they're dreaming
Hear the sirens screaming
Another time, another world
Girls were boys and boys were girls
Find the glitter in the litter
Like a haunt, it's got to move
Everybody needs some room
There's something out there
There's a long straight road
Out of the cold
And we can leave it all behind
I wanna get outside
Baby, let's get outside
I wanna get outside, outside
Of me
Oh, I found the space between the spaces
Standing in the nothing
And time will claim you
And as the wind will beat you down
And the wind the only sound
There's something out there
There's a long straight road
Out of the cold
And we can leave it all behind
I wanna get outside
Baby, let's get outside
I wanna get outside, outside
Of me
There's a long straight road
Out of the cold
And we can leave it all behind
I wanna get outside
Baby, let's get outside
I wanna get outside, outside
Of me
