<song artist="Foo_Fighters" title="Back_&_Forth">
Once upon a time I was somebody else
In another life I saw myself
Way back then back when I was new
Somewhere down the line I started to slip
Years gone by, biting my lip
All the while all this time I knew
Now you're on your own, one for the pages
Over the hill and through the ages
Does my heaven burn like hell on you?
Out beneath the cracks that come in waves
Rolling like an earthquake under the pavement
Where they now, tell me Mr. True
You gotta lot of nerve, nerve
Now show a little backbone, why don’t you?
I’m looking for some back and forth with you
Are you feeling the same as I do?
Now and now and then
I’m looking for some back and forth with you
Are you feeling the same as I do?
Down and out
Holding my breath, I waited and waited
How'd this simple life get so complicated?
Shoes to fill, secrets to spill down you
Deer in the headlights, spoke in the wheel
You won't pretend I need for real
Taking it back, all my IOUs
You gotta lot of nerve, nerve
Now show a little backbone, why don't you?
I’m looking for some back and forth with you
Are you feeling the same as I do?
Now and now and then
I’m looking for some back and forth with you
Are you feeling the same as I do?
Down and out
You gotta lot of nerve, nerve
Nerve, nerve
Now show a little backbone, why don’t you?
I’m looking for some back and forth with you
Are you feeling the same as I do?
Now and now and then
I’m looking for some back and forth with you
Are you feeling the same as I do?
Now and now and then
I’m looking for some back and forth with you
Are you feeling the same as I do?
Down and out
