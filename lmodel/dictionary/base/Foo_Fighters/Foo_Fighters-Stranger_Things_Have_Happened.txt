Goddamn this dusty room
This hazy afternoon
I'm breathing in this silence like never before
This feeling that I get
This one last cigarette
As I lay awake and wait for you to come through that door
Oh maybe, maybe, maybe
I can share it with you
I'll behave, I'll behave, I'll behave
So I can share it with you
You are not alone, dear Loneliness
You forgot, but I remember this
Oh stranger, stranger, stranger things have happened, I know
I am not alone, dear Loneliness
I forgot that I remember this
Oh stranger, stranger, stranger things have happened, I know
Ohh, ohh
I dream about somewhere
Our smoke will fill the air
As I lay awake and wait for you to walk out that door
I can change, I can change, I can change
But who you want me to be?
I'm the same, I'm the same, I'm the same
Or do you want me to be?
You are not alone, dear Loneliness
You forgot, but I remember this
Oh stranger, stranger
Stranger things have happened, I know
Ohh, ohh
Ohh, ohh
I am not alone, dear Loneliness
I forgot that I remember this
You are not alone, dear Loneliness
You forgot, but I remember this
Oh stranger, stranger, stranger things have happened I know
I am not alone, dear Loneliness
I forgot that I remember this
Oh stranger, stranger, stranger things have happened I know
Ohh, ohh
Ohh, ohh.
