<song artist="Foo_Fighters" title="Savior_Breath">
Breathe oh breathe now smother me
So clever me, I'm onto you
My oh my, now testify
I'm guilty by my clouds on you
Where you been?
How far'd you get?
I got this sin I saved for you
I don't need your remedy
I wanna be right
Sick of you
Sweetest torch, at least we were alive
Cringe and burns, all mark my words, so
Save your breath
Save your breath
Save your breath
'Cause it's mine
Save your breath
Save your breath
Save your breath
'Cause it's mine
Open wide, my crucify
I wanna ride my lungs on you
Nervous we, oh jealousy
It's gonna be their debt to you
Bang bang bang
Ain't no time
Bang bang bang
Ain't no time
Sweetest torch, at least we were alive
Cringe and burns, all mark my words, so
Save your breath
Save your breath
Save your breath
'Cause it's mine
Save your breath
Save your breath
Save your breath
'Cause it's mine
Bang bang bang
Ain't no time
Bang bang bang
Ain't no time
Sweetest torch, now mark my words and
Save your breath
Save your breath
Save your breath
'Cause it's mine
Save your breath
Save your breath
Save your breath
'Cause it's mine
Save your breath
Save your breath
Save your breath
'Cause it's mine
Mine!
