<song artist="Foo_Fighters" title="Down_In_The_Park">
Down in the park
Where the Machmen meet
The machines are playing 'kill-by-numbers'
Down in the park with a friend called 'Fire'
I was in a car crash
Or was it the war?
But I've never been quite the same
Little white lies like, 'I was there'
Come to 'Tom-Tom's'
The place to eat
Like it was built in one day
You can watch the humans trying to run
Oh, look, there's a rape machine
I'd go outside if it looked the other way
Wouldn't believe the things they do
Down in the park
Where the chant is 'death, death, death'
'Til the sun cries morning
Down in the park with friends of mine
'We are not lovers
We are not romantics
We are here to serve you'
A different face but the words never change
