<song artist="Foo_Fighters" title="Enough_Space">
I was waiting for something
Maybe flying machines
That's when I found Lily
Best I'd ever seen
Put her on the ceiling
Try to make her my own
People line up to see
But there never seems to be
Enough space
Space
Space
Space
I was waiting for something
Maybe flying machines
That's when I found Lily
Best I'd ever seen
Put her on the ceiling
Try to make her my own
People line up to see
But there never seems to be
Enough space
Space
Space
Space
Space
Space
Space
Space, woah
Space
Space
Space
Space
Space
Space
Space
Space, woah, woah
