<song artist="Foo_Fighters" title="Sean">
Hey I'm glad I caught you on the phone
Thirty hours until Iâ€™m back home
Been hallucinating, me and Sean
Time to turn his headlamp on
Yeah who you running from?
Someone left their haircut on the lawn
Twenty hours until I'm back home
Been commiserating, me and Sean
Think your face is getting long
Yeah who you running from?
Sean
Sean
Sean
Sean
You've been waiting in the waves
Waiting in the waves
I've been sipping poison just for fun
13 hours till I'm back home
Been obliterated, me and Sean
Getting good at getting gone
Yeah who you running from?
Sean
Sean
Sean
