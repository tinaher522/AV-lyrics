How i miss you
How i miss you
How i miss you
I should never call
How i hope that you still miss me
Did I lose you?
Did I lose you?
Did I lose you?
Somewhere down the line
Hide and seek's alright if i find....
Do you miss me,
Like i miss you
If you miss me,
Never go away
Hopefully... you'll come stay someday
If you're leaving,
come back soon
Thats not easy to say
I will wait here,
and dream of you
all alone as i ache
Did I lose you?
Did I lose you?
Did I lose you?
Somewhere down the line
Hide and seek's alright if i find....
Do you miss me,
Like i miss you
If you miss me,
Never go away
Hopefully... you'll come stay someday
If you're leaving,
come back soon
Thats not easy to say
I will wait here,
and dream of you
all alone as i ache
How i miss you
How i miss you
How i miss you
I should never call
How i hope that you still miss me
