<song artist="Foo_Fighters" title="Never_Talking_To_You_Again">
There are things that I'd like to say
But I'm never talking to you again
There's things I'd like to phrase some way
But I'm never talking to you again
I'm never talking to you again
I'm never talking to you
I'm tired of wasting all my time
Trying to talk to you
I'd put you down where you belong
But I'm never talking to you again
I'd show you every way you're wrong
But I'm never talking to you again
