<song artist="Foo_Fighters" title="Marigold">
He's there in case I won it all
He's scared 'cause I want
He's scared in case I want it all
He's scared 'cause I want
All in all the clock is slow
Six color pictures all in a row
Of a marigold
He's there in case I won it all
He's scared 'cause I want
He's there in case I won it all
He's scared 'cause I want
All in all the clock is slow
Six color pictures all in a row
Of a marigold
He's there in case I want it all
He's scared 'cause I want
He's there in case I won it all
He's there 'cause I won
All in all the clock is slow
Six color pictures all in a row
Of a marigold
