It was meant to be
But all along, it never meant a thing
Never stopped to ask you why
You didn't pass me by
Did you see me in your life
Flash before your eyes?
Was it just that I wasn't hard enough
Hard enough for you?
(Stop, stop, stop, stop)
Stop using my (Stop, stop, stop, stop)
(Stop, stop, stop, stop)
Confusion (Stop, stop, stop, stop)
(Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop)
Wait, wait
There's a world out there (There's a world out there)
Don't you deny me (Don't you deny me)
Give me one last wish (Give me one last wish)
There's a world out there
Elementary, I solved them all
All your mysteries
Settle down and in good time
We can solve all mine
Tell me lies or tell me when
Tear me up again
And I will let you know
When I've had enough
Had enough of you
(Stop, stop, stop, stop)
Stop using my (Stop, stop, stop, stop)
(Stop, stop, stop, stop)
Confusion (Stop, stop, stop, stop)
(Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop)
Wait, wait
There's a world out there (There's a world out there)
Don't you deny me (Don't you deny me)
Give me one last wish (There's a world out there)
There's a world out there (Don't you deny me)
I know you've got your reasons
Hey, let's call it even
Turn out all the lights and go to bed
Still, I get this feeling
No one will believe me
When I let these ghosts outside my head
There's a world out there (There's a world out there)
Don't you deny me (Don't you deny me)
Give me one last wish (Give me one last wish)
Don't you deny me (Don't you deny me)
There's a world out there (There's a world out there)
Don't you deny me (Don't you deny me)
Give me one last wish (There's a world out there)
There's a world out there (Don't you deny me)
