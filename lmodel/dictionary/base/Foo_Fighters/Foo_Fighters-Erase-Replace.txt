Attention.
Pay attention!
No mention; The sickest array
Omission; An admission
Ignition; Detonate.
Oh no, don't talk about it
No, please don't talk about it
Oh no, don't talk about it
Not one more word about it!
Oh no, don't think about it
No, please don't think about it
Oh please, don't think about it
It goes away..
Who made these promises?
You made these promises.
Erase/Replace
Erase/Replace
We'll make more promises,
We'll wait for promises.
Erase/Replace
Erase/Replace

A vision; Division
Revision; Regulate
Inaction; A reaction
Distraction; Question of fate
Oh no, don't talk about it
No, please don't talk about it
Oh no, don't talk about it
It goes away...
Who made these promises?
You made these promises.
Erase/Replace
Erase/Replace
We'll make more promises,
We'll wait for promises.
Erase/Replace
Erase/Replace

Oh, are we better off now?
Something left said
Meant for you
Oh, are we better off now?
Something left said
Meant for you
Who'll make these promises?
You'll make these promises.
Erase/Replace
Erase/Replace
We'll wait for promises,
We'll make more promises.
