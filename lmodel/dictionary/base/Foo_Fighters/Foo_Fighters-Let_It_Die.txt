<song artist="Foo_Fighters" title="Let_It_Die">
A heart of gold but it lost its pride.
Beautiful veins and bloodshot eyes.
I've seen your face in another light.
Why'd you have to go and let it die?
Why'd you have to go and let it die?
Why'd you have to go and let it die?
In too deep, and out of time,
Why'd you have to go and let it die?
A simple man and his blushing bride.
Why'd you have to go and let it die?
Intravenous, intertwined.
Why'd you have to go and let it die?
Heart's gone cold, your hands were tied,
Why'd you have to go and let it die?
Why'd you have to go and let it die?
Why'd you have to go and let it die?
Why'd you have to go and let it die?
Why'd you have to go and let it die?
In too deep, and out of time,
Why'd you have to go and let it die?
Do you ever think of me?
You're so considerate.
Did you ever think of me?
Oh, so considerate.
In too deep, and lost in time,
Why'd you have to go and let it die?
Beautiful veins and bloodshot eyes,
Why'd you have to go and let it die?
Heart's gone cold and hands are tied,
Why'd you have to go and let it die?
Why'd you have to go and let it die?
Do you ever think of me?
You're so considerate.
Did you ever think of me?
Oh, so considerate.
In too deep, and lost in time,
Why'd you have to go and let it die?
Beautiful veins and bloodshot eyes,
Why'd you have to go and let it die?
Heart's gone cold and hands are tied,
Why'd you have to go and let it die?
Why'd you have to go and let this die?
Why'd you have to go and let this die?
Why'd you have to go and let this die?
Why'd you have to go and let this die?
Why'd you have to go and let it die?
