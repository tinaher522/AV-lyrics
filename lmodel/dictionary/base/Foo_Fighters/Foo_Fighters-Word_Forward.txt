<song artist="Foo_Fighters" title="Word_Forward">
Good bye Jimmy, farewell youth
Must be on my way I've had enough of you
I was a young man, proud and true
Or just a simple boy with nothing left to lose
Years that I've wasted
These IOUs
They're just fucking words
This is life or death
It's time to clear the air
You better save your breath
Say have you heard
Say have you heard
The Poison in my heart
And voices in my head
Years that I've wasted
These IOUs
I meant every word for word for word forward
Word for word for word forward
Word for word for word forward
Word for word for word forward
But it's only words
I meant every word
They're just fucking words
Word (word) for word (for word) for word (for word) forward
Word (word) for word (for word) for word (for word) forward
Word for word for word forward
Word for word for word forward
Word for word for word forward
Word for word for word forward
Word (for word) for word (for word) for word (for word) forward
Word (for word) for word (for word) for word (for word) forward
