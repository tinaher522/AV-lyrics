<song artist="Foo_Fighters" title="Subterranean">
Nothing left within
I've been mined
Hell and back again
Subterranean
I've been diggin' in
Down inside
I will start again
Subterranean
But the truth is so unkind
What do you know
How low, the sky
Yeah, the truth is so unkind
What do you know
How low, the sky
You might think you know me
I know damn well you don't
Oh no, oh no, you don't
And you might think you owe me
I know know damn well you don't
Oh no, oh no, you don't
Bury my heart, can I do this alone
Oh no, oh no, I don't
Poison the sound, God in a stone
Oh no, oh no, you don't
Nothing left within
I've been mined
Hell and back again
Subterranean
I've been diggin' in
Down inside
I will start again
Subterranean
But the truth is so unkind
What do you know
How low, the sky
You might think you owe me
But I know damn well you don't
Oh no, oh no, you don't
And I might think you love me
But I know damn well you don't
Oh no, oh no you don't
Bring all your lies
Leave them deep in the dirt
Oh no, oh no, you don't
Hold down my eyes
Lay me deep in the earth
Oh no, oh no, you don't
Nothing left within
I've been mined
Hell and back again
Subterranean
I've been diggin' in
Down inside
I will start again
Subterranean
