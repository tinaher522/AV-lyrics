<song artist="Foo_Fighters" title="Weenie_Beenie">
I'm molasses
Hung in rent
Read a sponsor
One shot, no post-show
Tear it off, but not a lot, it's not enough to debate
As if you blame
Real and stagnate
Real and stagnate
Big shit, no shit
Tear it off, but not a lot, only so much you can take
Some try that hit
Beast and mud lead
Beast and mud lead
Big shit, no shit
Tear it off, but not a lot, only so much you can take
As if you blame
Real and stagnate
Real and stagnate
Big shit, no duh
Tear it off, but not a lot, it's not enough to debate
Right?
I'm molasses
Hung in rent
Read a sponsor
One shot, no post-show
Tear it off, but not a lot, only so much you can take
One shot nothing
One shot nothing
One shot nothing
One shot nothing
One shot nothing
One shot nothing
One shot nothing
