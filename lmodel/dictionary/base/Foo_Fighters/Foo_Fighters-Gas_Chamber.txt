<song artist="Foo_Fighters" title="Gas_Chamber">
Gas chamber, there's a light
Stay at home, don't feel right
In my room, all the time,
Trapped inside this twisted mind
Gas chamber, cannot breathe
Time for lunch, cannot leave
In my room, all the time,
Trapped inside this fucking mind
No action no, no
No action gas chamber
Oh, no
No action
