<song artist="Foo_Fighters" title="Iron_Rooster">
Have you ever been dumb enough to do what you wanted to do
Without good reason coming over you?
Have you ever been young enough to feel what you wanted to feel?
Take back those years for something real
I'm an iron rooster
Cold and still
Irregular sculpture
Held against my will
Have you ever been drunk enough to say what you wanted to say
Without no words getting in the way?
Have you ever been in love enough to be who you wanted to be?
I won't mind you if you won't mind me
I'm an iron rooster
Cold and still
Irregular sculpture
Held against my will
Can you believe we're older?
I won't believe it's over now
Do you remember being children?
Do you remember when? Now
I'm an iron rooster
Cold and still
Irregular sculpture
An iron rooster
Cold and still
Irregular sculpture
An iron rooster
An iron rooster
An iron rooster
Held against my will
