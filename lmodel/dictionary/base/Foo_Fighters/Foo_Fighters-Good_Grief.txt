<song artist="Foo_Fighters" title="Good_Grief">
Since I'm putting down
All of the true things around, but I like it
Handed down the crown
Given the jewels and the answers of may
Thought of being ousted
Comes and goes, comes and goes
When I think about it
The wind blows
Hate it, hate it, hate it, hate it
Hate it, hate it, hate it
Run me out of town
Somewhere a move might intended a gown at
Pissed at all the bowels
Always the blues and a delicate smile
Missed all of the sideways
Gull and noun, gull and noun
Chills and petty band-aids
Wrapped around
Hate it, hate it, hate it, hate it
Hate it, hate it, hate it
Good grief
Good grief
Since I'm putting down
All of the true things around, but I like it
Handed down the crown
Given the jewels and the answers of may
Thought of being ousted
Comes and goes, come and goes
When I think about it
The wind blows
Hate it, hate it, hate it, hate it
Hate it, hate it, hate it
