<song artist="Foo_Fighters" title="My_Tunnel">
I'm crawling through my tunnel
When everything is dim
Where does one go
I crawl in to my tunnel
It's kinda shaky may even crumble
I'm talking to a lame man
When you're maimed
Where does one go
I fall into my tunnel...
I'm walking into the jungle
When everything is right
Where does one go
I walk into the jungle
Sometimes I run-sometimes I stumble
I'm talking to a saved man
When you are sane
Where does one go
Back into the jungle
Out, out, out of the tunnel
Back, Back, to the jungle
Out, out, out of the tunnel
Take me back to my jungle
