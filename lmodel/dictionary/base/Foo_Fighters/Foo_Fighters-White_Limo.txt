Uh!
I’ll take it out of the wishing well
I'm thinkin' I have a plan
Go on with your bad self
What do you see in yourself?
You think you’re losin', it's time to stop accusin’
You’re never gonna take a hit on the head
Now, if you don't care
Take a ride somewhere
Hey! It has something you wanna try and buy yourself
Hey! It has something, it goes 'round and 'round again
Go! Go! You said that I’ve been away so long
Go! Go! And the ride was shared
Go limo
Go limo
I guess you're stuck in the Habitrail
You've grown to lovin' this shit
Way out on a back shelf
You’ll never know what you did
Look what you’re doin', now mama says it's ruined
You got a mollusk in the palm of your hand
So now it's a bad smell
Your ass won't win
Hey! It has something you wanna try and buy yourself
Hey! It has something, it goes 'round and 'round and 'round again
Go! Go! You never have been away so long
Go! Go! And the ride was shared
Go! Go! Whatever happened to Day-Glo clothes?
Go! Go! And the ride was shared
Go limo
Go limo
Yeah
All right
Whoa
