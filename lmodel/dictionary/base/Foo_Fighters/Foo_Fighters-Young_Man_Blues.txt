<song artist="Foo_Fighters" title="Young_Man_Blues">
Well a young man
Ain't got nothin' in the world these days
I said a young man
Ain't got nothin' in the world these days
You know in the old days
When a young man was a strong man
All the people they'd step back
When a young man walked by
But you know nowadays
Well it's the old man who's got all the money
But a young man
Ain't got nothin' in the world these days
You know the young man ain't got nothin'
Ain't got nothin' today
