<song artist="Jessie_J" title="Silver_Linings">
Call me crazy
In a world when no one, no one understands
It good to finally find someone, someone who can
You know me, better than I know myself
Don't care what they say, don't care what this world thinks
We got each other that's all we need
And you show me
I don't need nothing else
Call me crazy
Call me a fool, uh-huh
Call me crazy
Maybe it's true
But I'm crazy 'bout you
Crazy
I'm crazy 'bout you
I'm crazy
I can't help it, help it, uh
Nothing I can do
I'm crazy
Crazy 'bout you (crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy)
And I love it, 'cause I know, you're crazy 'bout me too
When I lose my mind
When I'm a total mess
I stop 'cause you still think I'm the best
And I love you
Even when you're a wreck
Call me crazy
Call me a fool, hey
Call me crazy
Maybe it's true
But I'm crazy 'bout you
I'm crazy
I'm crazy 'bout you
I'm crazy
You're my silver lining
You make the light come through
I'm crazy
Crazy 'bout you (crazy 'bout, crazy 'bout, crazy 'bout, crazy 'bout)
And I love it, 'cause I know you're crazy 'bout me too
And when this world tries to tear us down
They never will, they'll never break us apart
'cause they ain't crazy at heart
Call me crazy
Crazy 'bout you
I'm crazy
I'm crazy 'bout you
I'm crazy
I can't help it, help it
Nothing I can do (nothing I can do)
I'm crazy
Crazy 'bout you, yey~ey
And I love it 'cause I know
But I'm crazy 'bout you
I'm crazy
I'm crazy 'bout you
(I'm crazy, crazy, crazy 'bout you baby
Crazy, crazy, crazy 'bout you baby)
You're my silver lining
You make the light come through
I'm crazy
Crazy 'bout you
And I love it 'cause I know you're crazy 'bout me too
