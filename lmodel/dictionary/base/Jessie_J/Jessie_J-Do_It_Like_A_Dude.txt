Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!...
J-J-J-Jessie J
Stomp stomp, I've arrived
Drop the beat, nasty face while you're lookin' at me
Flyin', flyin', flyin', flyin' through the sky
In my spaceship, I'm an alien tonight
Dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty sucker
You think I can't get hood like you, you motherfucker
I can do it like a brother, do it like a dude
Grab my crotch, wear my hat low like you
Do it like a brother, do it like a dude
Grab my crotch, wear my hat low like you
We can do it like the man'dem, man'dem
We can do it like the man'dem, sugar, sugar, sugar
We can do it like the man'dem, man'dem
We can do it like the man'dem, sugar, sugar, sugar
Boom boom, pull me a beer
No pretty drinks, I'm a guy out here
Rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin' money like a pimp
My B-I-T-C-H's on my dick like this
Dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty sucker
You think I can't get hood like you, you motherfucker
I can do it like a brother, do it like a dude
Grab my crotch, wear my hat low like you
Do it like a brother, do it like a dude
Grab my crotch, wear my hat low like you
We can do it like the man'dem, man'dem
We can do it like the man'dem, sugar, sugar, sugar
We can do it like the man'dem, man'dem
We can do it like the man'dem, sugar, sugar, sugar
Boys, come-come say what you wanna
Boys, you-you need to lick my dollar
Boys, g-gettin' hot under the collar
Holler, holler, woah (Woah)
Boys, come-come say what you wanna
Boys, you-you need to lick my dollar
Boys, g-gettin' hot under the collar
Holler, holler, woah
I can do it like a brother, do it like a dude
Grab my crotch, wear my hat low like you
Do it like a brother, do it like a dude
Grab my crotch, wear my hat low like you
We can do it like a brother, do it like a dude
Grab my crotch, wear my hat low like you
Do it like a brother, do it like a dude
Grab my crotch, wear my hat low like you
We can do it like the man'dem, man'dem
We can do it like the man'dem, sugar, sugar, sugar
We can do it like the man'dem, man'dem
We can do it like the man'dem, sugar, sugar, sugar
Yeah, do it, do it like a dude
Do it, do it low like you
Do it, do it like a dude
Do it, do it, do it like a dude
