<song artist="Jessie_J" title="Said_Too_Much">
I think you might've said too much
Then you really messed me up
Thought that you would call this love, love
No, you can't take it back
But I think you might've said too much
I can't glue back broken glasses
But I can fix what you were smashing
Don't apologize again
I won't make a frozen bed
Stick, and stones, shattered bones
But in the end they always heal
All the lives, you crossed the lines
You showed me how you really do
Every time I look your way, I see my future clearer
I think you might've said too much
Then you really messed me up
Thought that you would call this love, love
No, you can't take it back
But I think you might've said too much
