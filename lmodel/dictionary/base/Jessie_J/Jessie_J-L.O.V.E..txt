<song artist="Jessie_J" title="L.O.V.E.">
ok, maybe this is the day that I have to write a song about love
its about time
L.O. L.O. L.O. L.O.V.E. Love
I said I'd never write a song about love
but when it feels this good
a song fits like a glove
when you hold me, and you tell me
that you missed me, and call me milky
fuck it, Imma write a song about love, yeea
your my key, you unlock me
keep me close, keep me safe, keep me happy
so sweet, ooooooh looooove
it's destiny, so nothing stops me
I'll tell the world that your mine, and you got me
so sweet, ooooooh looooove
I'm in loooove,
I'm in love,
I'm in looooooove,
I'm in love,
I'm in loooove,
L.O.V.E love
see love doesn't choose a boy, or a girl, nope
when I met you, you hugged my heart and filled my world
so you can stare
I don't care
your the one that ain't going nohere
so fuck it, Imma be honest, with you cause
your my key, you unlock me
keep me close, keep me safe, keep me happy
so sweet, ooooooh looooove
it's destiny, so nothing stops me
I'll tell the world that your mine, and you got me
so sweet, ooooooh looooove
I'm in love,
I'm in love,
I'm in love,
I'm in love
my best friend, that makes me laugh,
the puzzle piece that fits exact to my half
I've never felt this way
sometimes I'm stuck with what to say
you hold my hands when I'm driving
you dry my tears if I'm crying
and we just laugh if were fighting
I love you,
I love you more,
I love you more more,
You love me more,
I love you more,
loooooooooooooooooooooooove,
yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeea,
I love you more,
yeeeeeeea
ok so, I actually wrote a love song,
about someone,
and it's completely honest,
it's destiny, so nothing stops me
I'll tell the world that your mine, and you got me
so sweet, ooooooh looooove
I'm in love
I'm in love
I'm in love
it's about time
L.O.V.E. love
I'm in love
L.O.V.E. love
L.O. L.O.V.E. love
L.O. L.O.V.E. love
I'm in love
