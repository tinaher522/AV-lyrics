<song artist="Jessie_J" title="Masterpiece">
So much pressure
Why so loud?
If you don't like my sound
You can turn it down
I got a road
And I'm walking alone
Uphill battle
I look good when I climb
I'm ferocious,precocious 
i get braggadocios
i'm not gonna stop
I like the view from the top
you talk that blah blah
That la la, that rah rah sh*t
And I'm so done, I'm so over it
Sometimes I mess up, I eff up, I hit and miss
But I'm okay, I'm cool with this
I still fall on my face sometimes
And I can't color inside the lines
Cause I'm perfectly incomplete
I'm still working on my masterpiece
And I, I wanna hang with the greatest
Got a way to go, but it's worth the wait
No, you haven't seen the best of me
I'm still working on my masterpiece
Those who mind don't matter
Those who matter, don't mind
If you don't catch what I'm throwing
Then I leave you behind
gone in a flash
and I ain't leaving like that
They talk that blah blah
That la la, that rah rah sh*t
Go with the punches, and take the hits
Sometimes I mess up, I eff up, I swing and miss
But it's okay, I'm cool with this
I still fall on my face sometimes
And I can't color inside the lines
Cause I'm perfectly incomplete
I'm still working on my masterpiece
And I, I wanna hang with the greatest
Got a way to go, but it's worth the wait
No, you haven't seen the best of me
I'm still working on my masterpiece
I still fall on my face sometimes
And I can't color inside the lines
Cause I'm perfectly incomplete
I'm still working on my masterpiece
Masterpiece, masterpiece
I still fall on my face sometimes
And I can't color inside the lines
Cause I'm perfectly incomplete
I'm still working on my masterpiece
And I, I wanna hang with the greatest
Got a way to go, but it's worth the wait
No, you haven't seen the best of me
I'm still working on my masterpiece
