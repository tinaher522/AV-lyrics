<song artist="Jessie_J" title="Stand_Up">
If you surround yourself with negative people
You'll never feel settled in or become an equal - nooo.
They'll suppress you of your spirit and rinse you dry of smiles.
So reach deep and release your inner child. Yeah Yeah!
So Stand Up! For the Love, Love, Love
So Stand Up! For the Love, Love, Love
So Stand Up! Yeah
'Cause you're as old as you feel you are
And if you don't reach for the moon you can't fall on the stars
So I live my life like every day is the last, last, last
'Cause you're as old as you feel you are
And if you don't reach for the moon you can't fall on the stars
So I live my life like every day is the last, last, last
Listen!
If you let a frown become your normality, yes
You don't set an example for the youth of our humanity
If you spend every day wishing for the next to come
Aged and lifeless is what (Yes!) you'll become. Yeah Yeah!
So Stand Up! For the Love, Love, Love
So Stand Up! For the Love, Love, Love
So Stand Up! Yeah
'Cause you're as old as you feel you are
And if you don't reach for the moon you can't fall on the stars
So I live my life like every day is the last, last, last
'Cause you're as old as you feel you are
And if you don't reach for the moon you can't fall on the stars
So I live my life like every day is the last, last, last
So stand up
So ignore the bad and know the good is to come
Don't think second best
Be number one
Spread some love
Don't give to receive
Strive to be happy
And live to believe
So ignore the bad and know the good is to come
Don't think second best
Be number one
Spread some love
Don't give to receive
Strive to be happy
And live to believe. Yeah Yeah Yeah!
So Stand Up! For the Love, Love, Love
So let me see you. Yeah Yeah!
'Cause you're as old as you feel you are
And if you don't reach for the moon you can't fall on the stars
So I live my life like every day is the last, last, last
Break It Down!
So Stand Up! For the lololololololololololove Yeah
So Stand Up! For the lololololololololololove Ohh Ohh
So Stand Up! For the lololololololololololove Ohh Ohh
So Stand Up! Stand Up! Stand Up! Yeah
'Cause you're as old as you feel you are
And if you don't reach for the moon you can't fall on the stars
So I live my life like every day is the last, last, last
So Stand Up! For the Love, Love, Love
So Stand Up! For the Love, Love, Love
So Stand Up for the Love, Love, Yeah
So Stand Up!
