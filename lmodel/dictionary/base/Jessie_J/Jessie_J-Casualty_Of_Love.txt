<song artist="Jessie_J" title="Casualty_Of_Love">
We may not have all the answers
Oh, I know that we can change some of the things
That are beyond our control
And the vision of us may be blurry
But use your heart to see
Just follow the beat, the rhythm will lead you right back to me
Sometimes it's a game of give and take
It's easy to break
But hold on and wait
Have a little faith
I will go down to the last round
I'll be your strength to find you when you get lost in the crowd
So I'll stand up tall, if by chance I fall
Then I'll go down as a casualty of love
(Love, love, love, love)
Casualty
(Love, love, love, love)
Casualty
Casualty of, a casualty of love
The battle of us could be simple
Escape without being hurt
'Cause love is a shield, keeps us concealed
From what could get even worse
So baby, let me be your soldier
Don't be overtaken by pride
Just close your eyes, take my hand
Promise to keep us alive
Sometimes it's a game of give and take
It's easy to break
But hold on and wait
Have a little faith
I will go down to the last round
I'll be your strength to find you when you get lost in the crowd
So I'll stand up tall, if by chance I fall
Then I'll go down as a casualty of love
All is fair in love and war, knock me down
And I'll get back up wanting more
Through the fire and rain
It makes me numb from the pain
That's the price, that's the price I'll pay
And I will go down to the last round
I'll be your strength to find you when you get lost in the crowd
So I'll, I'll stand up tall, and baby if I fall
Then I'll go down as a casualty of love
(Love, love, love, love)
(Love, love, love, love)
Casualty, casualty
(Love, love, love, love)
Casualty of, a casualty of love
A casualty of love, casualty, casualty of love
