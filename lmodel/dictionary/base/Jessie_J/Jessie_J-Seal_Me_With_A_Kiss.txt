<song artist="Jessie_J" title="Seal_Me_With_A_Kiss">
Wanna do something that makes me crazy
Ooh, I want you now, now
Now, now, now
Take me, love me with your lips
Slay me, seal me with a kiss
With, with a kiss
Seal me with a kiss
With, with a kiss
Seal me with a kiss
Look at you, sexy, cool
Read my mind I wanna us to get down
Down, down, down
Cause with the dudes, you make your move
Just me and you, there ain't no rules
Aloud, loud, loud
No good at lying
I'm excited
Oh baby for you to come and
Take me, love me with your lips
Slay me, seal me with a kiss
With, with a kiss
Seal me with a kiss
With, with a kiss
Seal me with a kiss
