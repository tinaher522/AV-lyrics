<song artist="Jessie_J" title="Get_Away">
To admit or deny, yeah yeah
How's this a different kind of love?
It used to be saving us
Now it's just breaking us
It's not about just giving up
We knowing that safe enough
Get away, get away, get away
Get away, get away, get away-y-y
Get away, get away, get away
Do I stay cause you say you need me
I craved it more when it isn't easy
How am I supposed to grow?
It won't fix cause I say I love you
I need to show but I don't know how to
How am I supposed to grow?
It's a thin, thin light
To admit or deny, yeah yeah
How's this a different kind of love?
It used to be saving us
Now it's just breaking us
It's not about just giving up
We knowing that safe enough
Get away, get away, get away
Get away, get away, get away
Get away, get away, get away
