<song artist="Jessie_J" title="Loud">
Why do they hate me?
Why are their blocks set up to debate but only forsake me
How am I doing, and why do you care
When we fail comes the smile, when I went, I write, you just compare
So why, must've tried it on your love
When I'm better than what I've been
But that's not good enough
Why, you can't keep my distance sea
Steady me singing at friends
I'm talking over enemies
The world is so
Loud
Loud, loud
It's so loud
Loud, loud
It's like you and me drop in the crowd
They won't stop until they got them taken down
And the world is so loud
Loud, loud, it's so loud
Loud, loud
I tried to drown them all out in my sound
But they won't stop, stop until they tear you down
Until they tear me down
Until they tear me down
We saw my destruction
That's why I'm so reluctant
When we have passed the ball
But you're not on my team
You wanna cast a stone
We're so ready to fight
Got the nerve to ask, did I sleep? I heard you all through the night
Somebody tell me why, I know it's not just me
Over a billion voices
Don't think, just speak
You hate me when I'm loud
You love me when I'm down
I'm so confused by the world
And the world is so loud
Loud, loud, it's so loud
Loud, loud
Loud
Loud, loud
It's so loud
Loud, loud
It's like you and me drop in the crowd
They won't stop until they got them taken down
And the world is so loud
Loud, loud, it's so loud
Loud, loud
I tried to drown them all out in my sound
But they won't stop, stop until they tear you down
Until they tear me down
Until they tear me down
On a cloud, I swear
I couldn't hear a sound
I couldn't hear a sound
As a little girl
With a little fortune
Hoping this is true
So tear me down
The world is so loud
Loud
Loud, loud
It's so loud
Loud, loud
It's like you and me drop in the crowd
They won't stop until they got them taken down
And the world is so loud
Loud, loud, it's so loud
Loud, loud
I tried to drown them all out in my sound
But they won't stop, stop until they tear you down
Until they tear me down
