<song artist="Jessie_J" title="You_Don't_Really_Know_Me">
The girl who always says yes
Wants to scream no
Takes over everyone's stress
And ignores her own
The life and soul of the party
But loves to stay home
She say's she's not broken-hearted
But she cries on her own
Playing pretend
I shouldn't hide it
It isn't right
Being a liar
I'm crossing the line
Dancing with fire
When I'm not fine
Should I deny it?
Cause I'm going crazy when I'm not okay
I keep praying that the cracks don't show my pain
Cause even when I'm falling, I say my life is like a dream
But I'm fighting through a nightmare
Cause I'm not really being me
See you don't really know me
The girl who starts all the jokes
Just make her laugh
Preaches the do's and the don't's
But loves to be bad
Smiles when they guess who she's loving
What they say makes her mad
Fact is they truly know nothing
Cause she just wants a man
Playing pretend
I shouldn't hide it
It isn't right
Being a liar
I'm crossing the line
Dancing with fire
When I'm not fine
Should I deny it?
Cause I'm going crazy when I'm not okay
I keep praying that the cracks don't show my pain
Cause even when I'm falling, I say my life is like a dream
But I'm fighting through a nightmare
Cause I'm not really being me
See you don't really know me, baby, oh no
You don't really know me, no no
You don't really know me
How can you know me?
You don't really know me
You don't really know me
Cause I'm going crazy when I'm not okay
I keep praying that the cracks don't show my pain
Cause even when I'm falling, I say my life is like a dream
But I'm fighting through a nightmare
Cause I'm not really being me
See you don't really know me, baby, oh no
How can you know me? me, me, me, ooh, mhhm
You're gonna get to know me
