<song artist="Jessie_J" title="Run_Baby">
Yeah yeah yeah mmm
Does ..holding hands in the play ground any more
Just be a man and make a decision, walk at the door
Well, all of your feeling's gone
When did it ...
And you're my oh!
So run baby run run run ...
You know that I ain't gonna run
Just go away and have some fun
Just run baby run run run
Go back home.
Why can't you see the truth when is right in front of you
You don't love me anymore so I guess way through
You've changed and ...
I'm over tears so please don't move.
Chorus:
Run baby run run run
You know that I ain't gonan run
Just go away and have some fun
Just run baby run run run.
You only kepp on ..so I wasted on fights
Demons.. of lives ..do as right.
Chorus:
So run baby run run run
You know that I ain't gonna run
Just go away and have some fun
Just run baby run run run
Yeah uhh
...circle circle circle
Just run baby run
.... circle circle circle
2 x Chorus:
Yeah baby run run run
You know I ain't gonna run
Just go away and have some fun
Just run baby run run run.
Just run.
