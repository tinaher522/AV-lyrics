<song artist="Jessie_J" title="Watch_Yourself">
It says the more about you than anybody else
Disgraceful language huh, keep it for yourself
On the train in the ... when you're all before
Save your ... for when you're home alone
I'm spilling my heart out, ... I'm spilling my heart out
Cause I'm know you don't hear me,
You don't know your own, hear it in this song
... when the ... about, they can hear a story not a ...
So watch it yourself ... stereotype, ... let's be polite
So watch it yourself ... what I'm talk about, ... confused don't go down
Too much
So watch it yourself something about your mental health you need help
So watch yourself, ... to do it any situation
Whatever opinion don't try makin' my opinion
Cause when i hear somebody chatting all that bullshit
I wanna take them back to basics
I'm spilling my heart out, ... I'm spilling my heart out
Cause I'm know you don't hear me,
You don't know your own, hear it in this song
... when the ... about, they can hear a story not a ...
So watch it yourself ... stereotype, ... come just say be polite
So watch it yourself ... what I'm talk about, ... confused don't go down
Too much
So watch it yourself something about your mental health you need help
So watch yourself, you better watch yourself, you better watch yourself
You better watch yourself, you better watch yourself
You better watch yourself, you better watch yourself
You better watch yourself, you better watch yourself
I'm spilling my heart out, ... I'm spilling my heart out
Cause I'm know you don't hear me,
You don't know your own, hear it in this song
... when the ... about, they can hear a story not a ...
So watch it yourself ... stereotype, ... come just say be polite
So watch it yourself ... what I'm talk about, ... confused don't go down
Too much
So watch it yourself something about your mental health you need help
So watch yourself, you better watch yourself, you better watch yourself
You better watch yourself, you better watch yourself.
