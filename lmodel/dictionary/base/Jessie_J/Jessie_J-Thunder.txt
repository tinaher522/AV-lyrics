<song artist="Jessie_J" title="Thunder">
I'm a red and fragile rose
Won't grow in the dark alone
Take me there 'cause I need to find the light
I hate that I'm scared of this
But you believe so I'll take the risk
Hold me and tell me I'm alright
Now I'm falling down
You lift me up to the clouds
Yes, I'm falling down
You lift me up, yeah!
You make my hands shake
I watch the glass break
Around my guarded heart tonight
This ain't no mistake
You make my earth quake
You feel like thunder in the sky
Like thunder, thunder, thunder (oh-oh)
Thunder, thunder, thunder
Like thunder, thunder, thunder (oh-oh, oh)
You feel like thunder in the sky
Broke free, saw an open road
Footsteps lead me to your soul
Now I run with a home to go to
Never thought I'd be this happy
If you asking, yes you have me
How you change my thoughts, you'll never know
So when you're falling down
I'll lift you up to the clouds
Yes, when you're falling down
I'll lift you up, yeah!
You make my hands shake
I watch the glass break
Around my guarded heart tonight
This ain't no mistake
You make my earth quake
You feel like thunder in the sky
Like thunder, thunder, thunder (oh-oh)
Thunder, thunder, thunder
Like thunder, thunder, thunder (oh-oh, oh)
You feel like thunder in the sky
I was broken and starting
To think that I should be ashamed
Trebling and nervous
And naked and feeling afraid
Then you came and told me
And showed me to fight through the rain
Fight through the rain
To fight through the rain, yeah yeah yeah
You make my hands shake
I watch the glass break
Around my guarded heart tonight
This ain't no mistake
You make my earth quake
You feel like thunder in the sky
Like thunder, thunder, thunder (oh-oh)
Thunder, thunder, thunder
Like thunder, thunder, thunder (oh-oh, oh)
You feel like thunder in the sky
