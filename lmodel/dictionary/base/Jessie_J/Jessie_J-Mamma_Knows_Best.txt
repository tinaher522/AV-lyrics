<song artist="Jessie_J" title="Mamma_Knows_Best">
Well there is something going down 
Like the storm in the sky 
I ain't gonna be played by your behaviour 
How can I trust someone who's lying to me, so 
Bow out, go! 
Now I said bow out, leave! 
I said take your stuff and go, 
'Cuz you're not for me 
See Mamma knows best when times get hard 
And Papa always has a joke to make me laugh 
See Mamma knows best when I feel down 
To bring me up and always keep my feet on the ground 

See, I ain't no ragdoll
That you can pick up and drop, 
And all of this inconsistent love 
I think it's about time that it stops 
So bow out, go! 
Now I said bow out, leave! 
I said take a bow and go, 
'Cuz you're not for me 
Mamma knows best when times get hard 
And Papa always has a joke to make me laugh 
See Mamma knows best when I feel down 
To bring me up and always keep my feet on the ground 
Just be the best my daddy said to me 
Always use humour as your therapy, yeah 
Don't ever take life too seriously, 
Just do you, 'cuz you do you so perfectly 
See Mamma Mamma knows best 
See Daddy Daddy knows best 
See Mamma Mamma knows... 
See Mamma knows best when times get hard 
And Papa always has a joke to make me laugh 
See Mamma knows best when I feel down 
To bring me up and always keep my feet on the ground 
See Mamma Mamma knows best 
See Daddy Daddy knows best 
See Mamma Mamma knows best 
See Mamma Mamma knows best 
See Daddy Daddy knows best 
See Mamma Mamma knows best
