<song artist="Jessie_J" title="Nobody's_Perfect">
When I'm nervous, I have this thing, yeah, I talk too much
Sometimes I just can't shut the hell up
It's like I need to tell someone, anyone who'll listen
And that's where I seem to fuck up, yeah
I forget about the consequences (Yeah)
For a minute there I lose my senses
And in the heat of the moment, my mouth starts going
The words start flowing, ahh...
But I never meant to hurt you
I know it's time that I learnt to
Treat the people I love like I wanna be loved
This is a lesson learnt
I hate that I let you down
And I feel so bad about it
I guess karma comes back around
'Cause now I'm the one that's hurting, yeah
And I hate that I made you think
That the trust we had is broken
So don't tell me you can't forgive me
'Cause nobody's perfect, no, no
No-oh-oh-oh, no, no-oh-oh-oh, no
No, nobody's perfect, no
If I could turn back the hands of time
I swear I never would've cross that line
I should've kept it between us, but no, I went
And told the whole world how I'm feeling, uhh
So I sit and I realise
With these tears falling from my eyes
I gotta change if I wanna keep you forever
I promise that I'm gonna try
But I never meant to hurt you
I know it's time that I learn to
Treat the people I love like I wanna be loved
This is a lesson learnt
I hate that I let you down
And I feel so bad about it
I guess karma comes back around
'Cause now I'm the one that's hurting, yeah
And I hate that I made you think
That the trust we had is broken
So don't tell me you can't forgive me
'Cause nobody's perfect, no, no
No-oh-oh-oh, no, no-oh-oh-oh, no
No, nobody's perfect
Uhh, uhh, no, no, yeah
I'm not a saint, no, not at all
But what I did, it wasn't cool
But I swear that I'll never do that again to you, oh
I'm not a saint, no, not at all
And what I did, it wasn't cool
But I swear that I'll never do that again to you, yeah
I hate that I let you down
And I feel so bad about it
I guess karma comes back around
'Cause now I'm the one that's hurting, yeah
And I hate that I made you think
That the trust we had is broken
So don't tell me you can't forgive me
'Cause nobody's perfect, no
And I hate that I let you down
And I feel so bad about it
I guess karma comes back around
'Cause now I'm the one that's hurting, yeah
And I hate that I made you think
That the trust we had is broken
So don't tell me you can't forgive me
'Cause nobody's perfect, yeah, yeah, whoa
Don't tell me, don't tell
Don't tell me you can't forgive me
Oh, no, no-oh-oh-oh-oh, no
'Cause nobody's perfect, no
