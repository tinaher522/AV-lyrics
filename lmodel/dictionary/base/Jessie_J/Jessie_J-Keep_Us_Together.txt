<song artist="Jessie_J" title="Keep_Us_Together">
It's unpredictable, but I feel so good about it
And that's it, but we can promise
There's no way to get around it
Take this open road
I wanna get it right
Get ready, if we don't try it
And I'm scared, I can't deny it
Well, living ain't enough
We just wanna give up
It ain't easy trying to stay in love
Are we gonna walk out, when it rains?
Just tell me we got enough of love, love to keep us together
Say we got enough of love, love to keep us together
Arguments, back and forth, disagreements
Can we make it up, make it right, fix it?
Cause it ain't always gonna be perfect, baby
It's gonna be crazy, we fight
I'm wrong, you're right
Baby, sometimes it's unpredictable, but I feel so good about it
And that's it, but we can promise
There's no way to get around it
Take this open road
I wanna get it right
Get ready, if we don't try it
And I'm scared, I can't deny it
Well, living ain't enough
We just wanna give up
It ain't easy trying to stay in love
Are we gonna walk out, when it rains?
Just tell me we got enough of love, love to keep us together
Say we got enough of love, love to keep us together
Say we got enough, say we got enough, of our love, of our love
(x3)
Say we got enough, say we got enough, of our love
Well, living ain't enough
We just wanna give up
It ain't easy trying to stay in love
Are we gonna walk out, when it rains?
Just tell me we got enough of love, love to keep us together
Say we got enough of love, love to keep us together
Say we got enough of our love to keep us together
Say we got enough of our love to keep us together
Together, together
Together, together
