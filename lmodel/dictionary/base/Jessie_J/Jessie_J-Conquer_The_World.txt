<song artist="Jessie_J" title="Conquer_The_World">
I know how it feels to cry, in the middle of the night
With nobody else by my side (no no)
If you need to escape the dark, let me be your light
So know that you don't have to be alone, in this fight
Nooooo
(Oh ooh ooh) I know cause I've been there
(Oh ooh ooh) So when you're going no where (nooo)
Don't ev-er give up, on us, on us, on us
Say you'll fight for love, promise, promise, promise
I'm gonna be strong for ya, when the days get rough
So don't ever give up, together we can conquer the world (Oooh)
Together we can conquer the world
I know how it feels to scream, cause nobody believes
They're telling you forget your dreams (yeah, yeah)
Don't let it sink in too deep, I don't ever wanna see
You giving up ever, because you got me (yay yeah)
(Oh ooh ooh) I know cause I've been there
(Oh ooh ooh) So we are going no where (nooo)
Don't ev-er give up, on us, on us, on us
Say you'll fight for love, promise, promise, promise
I'm gonna be strong for ya, when the days get rough
So don't ever give up, together we can conquer the world (Oooh)
Together we can conquer the world
Listen! When no one else, is there to help
I will be there!
(Oh ooh ooh) I know cause I've been there
(Oh ooh ooh) So we are going no where (nooo)
Don't ev-er give up, on us, on us, on us
Say you'll fight for love, promise, promise, promise
I'm gonna be strong for ya, when the days get rough
So don't ever give up, together we can conquer the world (Oooh)
Together we can conquer the world (oooh)
Together we can conquer (together we can conquer the world)
Together we can conquer (together we can conquer the world)
Together, Together, Together
