<song artist="Jessie_J" title="My_Shadow">
You'll never leave me
You'll never leave me
You'll never leave me
You'll never leave me
I wish I could have another minute, to finish this fairytale
Hear your voice and get lost in it, cause all I got is broken details
You were my world and everything in it, so how did you dissappear
I won't say it is over, cause you're still here.
You're my shadow, my shadow, I know you're close
My shadow, my shadow, you're everywhere I go
So I dont see the need to cry cause, you'll never leave my life
My shadow, my shadow, oh
You'll never leave me
You'll never leave me
You'll never leave me
You'll never leave me
I won't forget I will sit and reminisce, tell each other all our secrets.
To have you back would be my only wish (cause nobody knew me like you did).
The things you knew were all writen in my diary, hide and seek open up and come and spy me
Count to ten and I dont know what to feel
I can't feel, don't feel I can't feel
My shadow, my shadow, I know you're close
My shadow, my shadow, you're everywhere I go
So I don't see the need to cry cause, you'll never leave my life
My shadow, my shadow, you'll never leave me
After all I swear you won't feel alone, my heartbeat's ticking like it's made from stone
I won't let you down, get pushed down, fill me up again, Yeah
I'm breaking, see I'm shaking, but I know your waiting, Yeah yeah
You'll never leave me
You'll never leave me
You'll never leave me
You'll never leave me
My shadow, my shadow, I know you're close,
My shadow, my shadow, you're everywhere I go,
So I don't see the need to cry cause, you'll never leave my life
My shadow, my shadow
My shadow, my shadow
You'll never leave me
You'll never leave me
You'll never leave me
You'll never leave me
