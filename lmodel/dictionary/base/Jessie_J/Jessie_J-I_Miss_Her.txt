<song artist="Jessie_J" title="I_Miss_Her">
It's not fair
I'm talking to You upstairs
Are you there?
You know I care
So please don't tell me that this is an empty prayer
Oh no
'Cause all she has and she's lost
I wish she could remember
I watch it fade and slip away
It's hurting more than ever
I miss her even though she's still here
You need to give a sign
Don't let her disappear
I'd give her my forever
If it meant for a day she can really be okay
'Cause I miss her
Even though she's still here
Is this pretend?
Will she really not know my face?
In the ending
If You're a friend a friend a friend
Show me how to heal it when she can't even feel it
Please... show me
'Cause all she has and she's lost
I wish she could remember
I watch it fade and slip away
It's hurting more than ever
I miss her even though she's still here
You need to give a sign
Don't let her disappear
I'd give her my forever
If it meant for a day she can really be okay
'Cause I miss her
And promise me this
When she goes
Everything she sees will set her free
Fourteen and the color green
Promise me this
That she knows
That the people that she loves
Will love her in the skies above
I miss her even though she's still here
You need to give a sign
So don't let her disappear
I'd give her my forever forever forever
If it meant for a day she can really be okay
'Cause I miss her
Even though she's still here
She's still here oh
I miss her, I miss her miss her
I just miss her, I miss her miss her
I miss her
Even though she's still here
