Jessie J:
Me-me–me–me–me, that's all you ever talk about
Me-me–me–me–me, sick of when you scream and shout
Me-me–me–me–me, so baby go and run your mouth
R-r-r-run your mouth, r-r-r-run your mouth
I-I-I-I–I, I try and show you that I'm there
I-I-I-I–I, I end up ripping out my hair
Why-y-y-y-y do I even wanna care?
W–w–w-wanna care, w-wanna care, care
I can't believe that this is what it's come to
I've held it in, but it's time you know the truth
Excuse my rude but I really hate you
I never thought I'd be the one to fall for it and let you in
To mess it up once again, I'm over it so here it is
Excuse my rude but I really hate you
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, this isn't how it was before
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, now I'm the girl you can't ignore
Now-ow-ow-ow-ow, I'm brave enough to say no more
No more, no more, n–n–n–n–n-no more, more
Doo-woo-woo-woo-woo, you even want to understand
Doo-woo-woo-woo-woo, you think you're still in command
Doo-woo-woo-woo-woo, you see I got the upper hand
U-u-u-up
I can't believe that this is what it's come to
I've held it in, but it's time you know the truth
Excuse my rude but I really hate you
I never thought I'd be the one to fall for it and let you in
To mess it up once again, I'm over it so here it is
Excuse my rude but I really hate you
Becky G:
They say hate is a strong word, but I got that urge
T-t-treat me like a waiter so you better get served
With that Becky G special, I'm shakin your credentials
Acting like a Benz but to me you just a rental
Keep it simple, it's not about the cars acting hard
It's too easy, boy you gotta please me, believe me
So I hit you on the telly when I'm in your areay next nevuary
Jessie J:
I can't believe that this is what it's come to
I've held it in, but it's time you know the truth
Excuse my rude but I really hate you
I never thought I'd be the one to fall for it and let you in
To mess it up once again, I'm over it so here it is
Excuse my rude but I really hate you
