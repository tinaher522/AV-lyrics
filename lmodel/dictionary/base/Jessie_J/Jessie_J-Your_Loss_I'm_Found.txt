<song artist="Jessie_J" title="Your_Loss_I'm_Found">
Where did we go?
Put your hand down
I'm scared too long
What I'm feeling, yeah
Say yes or no
Do I give up and just let go
Or keep on dreaming?
What is this?
I was yours, you let me go
Are you bored?
Is this love, can you tell me?
I've had enough
So tell me
How can I be your lover?
Stars ain't made to shine under clouds
Stop turning me down
One day when you discover
How bright I try to love you now
I won't be around
It's too late
Your loss I'm found
I gave my all
Guess you knew all along
I would fall
For your teasing, why?
And no matter what, I won't go back to who I was
And watch you will be there, oh no
How can I be your lover?
Stars ain't made to shine under clouds
Stop turning me down
One day when he discovers
How bright I try to love you now
I won't be around
It's too late
Your loss I'm found
