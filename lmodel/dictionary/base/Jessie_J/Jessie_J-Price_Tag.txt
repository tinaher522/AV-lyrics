<song artist="Jessie_J" title="Price_Tag">
Okay, Coconut Man, Moonheads, and Pea
You ready?
Seems like everybody's got a price
I wonder how they sleep at night
When the sale comes first
And the truth comes second
Just stop for a minute and smile
Why is everybody so serious?
Acting so damn mysterious
Got your shades on your eyes
And your heels so high
That you can't even have a good time
Everybody look to the left
Everybody look to the right
Can you feel that? (yeah)
We're paying with love tonight
It's not about the money, money, money
We don't need your money, money, money
We just wanna make the world dance
Forget about the price tag
Ain't about the (uh) cha-ching, cha-ching
Ain't about the (yeah) ba-bling, ba-bling
Wanna make the world dance
Forget about the price tag
(Okay!)
We need to take it back in time
When music made us all unite
And it wasn't low blows and video hoes
Am I the only one gettin' tired?
Why is everybody so obsessed?
Money can't buy us happiness
Can we all slow down and enjoy right now?
Guarantee we'll be feelin' alright
Everybody look to the left, (to the left)
Everybody look to the right, (to the right)
Can you feel that? (yeah)
We're paying with love tonight
It's not about the money, money, money
We don't need your money, money, money
We just wanna make the world dance
Forget about the price tag
Ain't about the (uh) cha-ching, cha-ching
Ain't about the (yeah) ba-bling, ba-bling
Wanna make the world dance
Forget about the price tag
B.o.B:
Yeah, yeah
Well, keep the price tag
And take the cash back
Just give me six strings and a hashtag
And you can keep the cars
Leave me the garage
And all I...
Yes, all I need are keys and guitars
And guess what, in thirty seconds, I'm leaving to Mars (Mars)
Yeah, we leaping across ('cross) these undefeatable odds
It's like this man, you can't put a price on a life
We do this for the love so we fight and sacrifice every night
So we ain't gon' stumble and fall, never
Waiting to see or send a sign of defeat? Uh-uh
So we gon' keep everyone moving their feet
So bring back the beat and then everyone sing
Jessie J and B.o.B:
It's not about the money
Jessie J:
Money, money
We don't need your money, money, money
We just wanna make the world dance
Forget about the price tag
Ain't about the (uh) cha-ching, cha-ching
Ain't about the (yeah) ba-bling, ba-bling
Wanna make the world dance
Forget about the price (Hey) tag (Hey)
It's not about the money, money, money (We don't need it)
We don't need your money, money, money (I don't, we don't need it)
We just wanna make the world dance (dance, dance, dance)
Forget about the price tag
Ain't about the (yeah) cha-ching, cha-ching
Ain't about the (it ain't about whoo!) ba-bling, ba-bling
Wanna make the world dance (Yeah, yeah)
Forget about the price tag (Forget about the price tag)
Yeah, yeah
Oo-oooh
Forget about the price tag
