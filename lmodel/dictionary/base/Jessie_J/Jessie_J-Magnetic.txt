<song artist="Jessie_J" title="Magnetic">
Light up, don't know how I did it right from the beginning, my head's kinda spinning
Light up, I wont be forgiven, my life is forbidden, they say it's a miracle
Sometimes I don't even know if I'm wrong or right
I try to drown the sorrow that surfaces every night
I'm moving at a speed that makes everybody look slow
What happens if I let it go
But There ain't no way you're pulling me down
I recharge to speakers and sound
It's okay, it isn't your fault
Everything is alright
Take me to the place I know
Anywhere that feels like home
Somewhere that if I let go
Someone's gonna catch my soul
Magnetic (I've never lived life, as steady as we go)
Here we go! (The sky is the limit as long as it feels good)
Magnetic (I've never lived life, as steady as we go)
Here we go! (The sky is the limit as long as it feels good)
Here we go!
Show me love, Sometimes when you give you don't always get it
That's all that you wanted
Angels, Watch like television
God over my mission, So I gotta finish up
Sometimes I don't even know if I'm wrong or right
I try to drown my sorrow that surfaces every night
I'm moving at a speed that makes everybody looks slow
What happens if I let it go
But There ain't no way you're pulling me down
I recharge to speakers and sound
It's okay, it isn't your fault
Everything is alright
Take me to the place I know
Anywhere that feels like home
Somewhere that if I let go
Someone's gonna catch my soul
Magnetic (I've never lived life, as steady as we go)
Here we go! (The sky is the limit as long as it feels good)
Magnetic (I've never lived life, as steady as we go)
Here we go! (The sky is the limit as long as it feels good)
Here we go!
Trumpets, and beast. Lick tears from my cheeks
I wont hide, behind tweets
And smiles for life
Take me to the place I know
Anywhere that feels like home
Somewhere that if I let go
Someone's gonna catch my soul
Magnetic (I've never lived life, as steady as we go)
Here we go! (The sky is the limit as long as it feels good)
Magnetic (I've never lived life, as steady as we go)
Here we go! (The sky is the limit as long as it feels good)
Here we go!
