<song artist="Jessie_J" title="Fastlane">
I never ever thought you'd would see me in a ..
I didn't think you're here with everything so loud
Here I am take believe me,
Do what I can, now you see me
24 7 I can talk to talk so go back off the wall.
Chorus:
Walk into the fastlane
Got me movin me in the right way
Got my .. my body to say
No need no need to slow down, slow down,
Slow down, slow down.
Intoxication ..spinnin' round and round and round
White lights , big city, I'm hearing naked sounds
Can't believe am I dreaming
Pinch me please I must be sleeping
24 7 .. back off the wall.
2 x Chorus:
Walk into the fastlane
Got me movin me in the right way
Got my .. my body to say
No need no need to slow down, slow down,
Slow down, slow down.
... I want to ..spinnin' round and round
Not what I wanna be
My head is in the clouds
Not ..where I want to be spinnin' round and round
Stop slow down now, stop slow.
[2 x Chorus:]
Slow down, slow down, slow down, slow down.
