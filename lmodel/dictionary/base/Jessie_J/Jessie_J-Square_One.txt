<song artist="Jessie_J" title="Square_One">
Roll the dice, double two, no more us, no me and you
What a struggle, I took a risk, another life, another kiss
I start again, it keeps going, we're best friends, not even knowing
I win the race, and then I fall, I gave it up, to have it all
We let go of love so we can go again
We don't hesitate to let somebody in
To build a home just to get lost
We fire it up just to burn it off
I don't wanna, hold hands with a stranger.
I don't wanna walk when I just learned how to run.
I don't wanna care, 'cause it's human nature
I don't wanna go go go go back to square one.
Said she don't don't wanna go back to square one
I just wanna be the one.
In the dark, it's brand new
You're teaching me, I'm teaching you
Imagination, I wanna please
But I'm tired of the tease
Give you substance, I need soul
Not just a moment to come and go
It's not simple, it never is
Another life, another kiss
We let go of love so we can go again
We don't hesitate to let somebody in
To build a home just to get lost
We fire it up just to burn it off
I don't wanna, hold hands with a stranger
I don't wanna walk when I just learnt how to run
I don't wanna care, 'cause it's human nature
I don't wanna go go go go back to square one
She says she don't wanna go go back to square one, she just wanna find the one someone that she needs, she needs, she needs.
Everybody sing she don't wanna go go back to square one, she just wanna find the one someone that she needs, she needs, she needs.
I don't wanna, hold hands with a stranger.
I don't wanna walk when I just learnt how to run.
I don't wanna care, cause it's human nature
I don't wanna go go go go
She says she don't wanna go go back to square one
She just wanna find the one
Someone that she needs, she needs, she needs
She says she don't wanna go go back to square one
She just wanna find the one
Someone that she needs, she needs, she needs
I don't wanna, hold hands with a stranger.
I don't wanna walk when I just learnt how to run.
I don't wanna care, cause it's human nature
I don't wanna go go go go
