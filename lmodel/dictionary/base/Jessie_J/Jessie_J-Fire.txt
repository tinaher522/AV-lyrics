<song artist="Jessie_J" title="Fire">
He is the flame
He draws me in
That burns within
It's a picture sweet, oh
The fix, the craze, by now he needs
Who I can breathe
And I just can't pull away
Can't get away, oh, oh
From the fire, fire, fire
I never wanna put it out
Burning, burning, burning
Fire, fire, fire
I never wanna put it out
Burning, burning, burning
My hands they burn, they're black, they bleed
And when was asleep, my whole world is cold now
The blaze, the heat is putting out
Can't live without
Yeah, just can't blow away
Can't get away, oh, oh
From the fire, fire, fire
I never wanna put it out
Burning, burning, burning
Fire, fire, fire
I never wanna put it out
Burning, burning, burning
Fire
Fire
Fire
Burning my soul now
From the fire, fire, fire
I never wanna put it out
Burning, burning, burning
Fire, fire, fire
I never wanna put it out
Burning, burning, burning
