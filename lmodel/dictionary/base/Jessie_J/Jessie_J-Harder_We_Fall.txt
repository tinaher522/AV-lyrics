<song artist="Jessie_J" title="Harder_We_Fall">
So whatever path we chose to take
There will be highs and there will be lows the same
Oh well never run from our mistakes
The harder we fall the harder we try
Ain't it funny how were all afraid
That tomorrow everything could change
We forgot we gotta just enjoy the night
That's right yeah
Ain't it funny how were all the same
Different story for a different name
We forget we gotta just enjoy the ride tonight so
So oooo oooo, you gotta live your life true
To how you feel inside
You gotta live your life
Put your hands up
Buckle up and fight
So whatever path we chose to take
There will be highs, and there will be lows the same
Oh well never run from our mistakes
The harder we fall the harder we try
Have you ever really lost your mind
Then realize it was a waste of time
Thinking bout all the things you cant control oh no
Have you really ever gone insane?
Focusing on what you cant explain
It's good to know that I'm not the only one, come on
Say!
Oooo oooo, you gotta live your life true
To how you feel inside
You gotta live your life
Put your hands up
Buckle up and fight!
So whatever path we chose to take
There will be highs, and there will be lows the same
Oh well never run from our mistakes
The harder we fall the harder we try again
Oh oh, oh oh, oh, oh
The hadrer we fall
Oh oh, oh oh, oh, oh
Well just try again
Oh oh, oh oh, oh, oh
The harder we fall
Oh oh, oh oh, oh, oh
Well just try again
So whatever path we chose to take
There will be highs, and there will be lows the same
Oh well never run from our mistakes
The harder we fall the harder we try
So whatever path we chose to take
There will be highs, and there will be lows the same
Oh well never run from our mistakes
The harder we fall the harder we try
Well just try again
