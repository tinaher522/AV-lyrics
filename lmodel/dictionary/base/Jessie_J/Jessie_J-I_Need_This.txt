<song artist="Jessie_J" title="I_Need_This">
Stop, where am I? 
Shock, I can't cry 
Pop, I need some space 
No, this isn't me 
Go, please let me breathe 
I'll be back sooner than you know 
I need this space 
Just like you need it 
I need this time 
Time to clear up my mind 
Wait, did you hear that? 
Hear my heart beat 
I need this feeling 
Whoa yeah, I really need this 
Well, I've been blind 
I hope I'll be fine 
Don't call me back, no 
Yes, I see light 
Now, it's so bright 
Call my name, I'll be there soon 
I need this space 
Just like you need it 
I need this time 
Time to clear up my mind 
Wait, did you hear that? 
Hear my heart beat 
I need this feeling 
Wait, did you hear that? 
Hear my heart beat 
I need this feeling 
Whoa yeah, I really need this 
I need this, I need this 
Really need, whoa 
You know it's not personal 
Sorry if I'm hurting you 
Please don't give up on me now 
I needed this time alone 
To know I could come back home 
To breathe, breathe, breathe 
I need this space 
Just like you need it 
I need this time 
Time to clear up my mind 
Wait, did you hear that? 
Hear my heart beat 
I need this feeling 
Wait, did you hear that? 
Hear my heart beat 
I need this feeling 
I really need this 
I need this, I need this 
Whoa, whoa, yeah, oh 
I really need 
Whoa, whoa, hey, hey, I need 
Really, really need 
I need, I need this, need this, need this 
I really need this
