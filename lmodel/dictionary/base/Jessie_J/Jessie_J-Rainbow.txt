Rainbow
We're the colours of the rainbow (oh)
Rainbow
Jessie J
He grew up in the city
Had a lot of money
Sponging off his daddy all the time
He lives in a bubble
Never had to struggle
He's far from the benefit line
But he feels blue sometimes
And he blood bleeds red like mine
The grass is greener on the other side
What I'm saying is we're all alike
We're the colours of the rainbow (yeah, yeah)
Let's share our pot of gold
We're the colours of the rainbow (yeah, yeah)
Everybody's on the yellow brick road
There's enough for you, you, you
There's enough for me, me, me
We're the colours of the rainbow (yeah, yeah)
We're the colours of the rainbow (yeah, yeah)
(Rainbow (x7)
There's mummy in the ghetto
Gotta work it double
Just to pay the bills and get by
But more power to ya
You're doing what you do-a
Everybody's steady on the grime
But you feel blue sometimes
And you're blood bleeds red like mine

The grass is greener on the other side
What I'm saying is we're all alike
We're the colours of the rainbow (yeah, yeah)
Lets share our pot of gold
We're the colours of the rainbow (yeah, yeah)
Everybody's on the yellow brick road
There's enough for you, you, you
There's enough for me, me, me
We're the colours of the rainbow (yeah, yeah)
We're the colours of the rainbow (yeah, yeah)
Hello, hello
Why does everybody get so mad?
Yellow, yellow
It's the colour for the battle in my head
I have a beat in my life like love in my heart
The sun up in the sky as we rock with the stars
We just cant keep fighting anymore
No, no, no
We're the colours of the rainbow (yeah, yeah)
Lets share our pot of gold
We're the colours of the rainbow (yeah, yeah)
Everybody's on the yellow brick road
There's enough for you, you, you
There's enough for me, me, me
We're the colours of the rainbow (yeah, yeah)
We're the colours of the rainbow (yeah, yeah)
We're the colours of the rainbow
