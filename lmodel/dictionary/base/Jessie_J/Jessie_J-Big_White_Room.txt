<song artist="Jessie_J" title="Big_White_Room">
Sitting in a big white room alone 
Tilt my head back, feel the tears roll down 
Cause my eyes can't see in the dark 
I feel young, broken, so so scared 
I don't wanna be here anymore 
Wanna be somewhere else 
Normal and free, like I used to be 
But I have to stay in this big white room 
With little old me 
I'm going crazy 
I'm losing my mind 
I'm going crazy 
In this big white room of mine 
I'm going crazy 
I'm losing my mind 
I'm going crazy 
In this big white room of mine 
Sitting in a big white room alone 
Close the door 
Don't want the pain to come in 
I clench my fist 
And try to stay strong 
I cry, feel sick 
My heart is beating out of control 
Can I run more faster than you 
I wanna feel my body again 
Feel the wind in my hair 
But I have to stay in this big white room 
Cos no one else cares 
I'm going crazy 
I'm losing my mind 
I'm going crazy 
In this big white room of mine 
I'm going crazy 
I'm losing my mind 
I'm going crazy 
In this big white room of mine 
Everybody's looking at me 
Everybody's staring at me 
What do I do now 
Smile, yeah 
Everybody's looking at me 
Everybody's staring at me 
What do I do now 
Smile, yeah 
I'm going crazy 
I'm losing my mind 
I'm going crazy 
In this big white room of mine 
I'm going crazy 
I'm losing my mind 
I'm going crazy 
In this big white room of mine 
I'm going crazy 
I'm losing my mind 
I'm going crazy 
In this big white room of mine 
I'm going crazy 
I'm losing my mind 
I'm going crazy 
In this big white room of mine
