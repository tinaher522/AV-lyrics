<song artist="Jessie_J" title="5_Down">
I've set the scene right
It's almost midnight
The smell of sweetness in the air
The candles burning high
And it's cold outside
Please run your fingers through my hair
I wanna feel you
I wanna smell you on my skin
I wanna see you
I wanna hear you whisperin'
I wanna taste you
Baby like it's our first time
5 down and the sixth sense is mine
'cause you've got me going ooooh (ooh)
'cause you've got me going aaaah (aah)
No matter what you do (do),
Baby my sixth sense is you (yeah)
'cause you've got me going ooooh (ooh)
You've got me going aaaah (aah)
No matter what you do (do),
My sixth sense is you
Bathwater steaming, I wanna taste your lips
And when I was dreaming
Come on let's take a dip
Baby please talk to me
Let me hear your voice caressing my skin
I can see your body, so let it begin
I wanna feel you
I wanna smell you on my skin
I wanna see you
I wanna hear you whisperin'
I wanna taste you
Baby like it's our first time
5 down, and the sixth sense is mine
'cause you've got me going ooooh (ooh)
'cause you've got me going aaaah (aah)
No matter what you do (do),
Baby my sixth sense is you (yeah)
'cause you've got me going ooooh (ooh)
You've got me going aaaah (aah)
No matter what you do (do),
My sixth sense is you
I wanna feel you, smell you,
See ya, hear ya,
Taste ya, baby 5 down
(x2)
'cause you've got me going ooooh (ooh)
'cause you've got me going aaaah (aah)
No matter what you do (do),
Baby my sixth sense is you (yeah)
'cause you've got me going ooooh (ooh)
You've got me going aaaah (aah)
No matter what you do (do),
My sixth sense is you
