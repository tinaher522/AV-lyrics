Ok, this is Jessie J! 
OCD! Hey! 
I don't like people putting that shit on me; 
I got OCD, I'm warped. 
I hate your house; it's always a mess. 
So, please clean your shit, things need to look their best. 
I hate your dust, your dirt, your mould and your fluff! 
Ugh! A dirty disease all over my stuff! 
So just clean it! Polish, scrub, bleach! 
Mr. Sheen it! Reveal that clean layer, 
and conceal it! Don't get dirt on me. 
So just clean it! Cuz I got OCD!
Uh! Uh! I got OCD! 
Hahaha, I got OCD! Yeah.
I hate your dirt all over my place, 
so run away, you rub shit in my face! 
I hate your scum, your mank, you make you sick you're so grim! 
Cuz you're polluting me with your problem bin. 
So just clean it! Polish, scrub, bleach! 
Mr. Sheen it! Reveal that clean layer, 
and conceal it! Don't get dirt on me. 
So just clean it! Cuz I got OCD!
I hate your filth, it's making me smell; 
with OCD that don't go down too well! 
I hate your trash, your mess! Your rent is due, 
but that can come after you clean up your residue! 
So just clean it! Polish, scrub, bleach! 
Mr. Sheen it! Reveal that clean layer, 
and conceal it! Don't get dirt on me. 
So just clean it! Cuz I got OCD!
I'm not your dump, (I'm not your dump.)
you need some black bags and Cillit Bang. (You need some Cillit Bang.)
I'm not your bin, (I'm not your bin)
you need a hoover and a washing machine! (A washing machine.) 
I'm not your dump, (I'm not your dump)
you need some black bags and Cillit Bang. (You need some Cillit Bang.)
I'm not your bin, (I'm not your bin)
you need a hoover and a washing machine! Hey! 
Let me hear you say "OCD, OCD".  
So just clean it! Polish, scrub, bleach! 
Mr. Sheen it! Reveal that clean layer, 
and conceal it! Don't get dirt on me. 
So just clean it! Cuz I got OCD! 
Hey! 
I got OCD! 
Hey! Oooooh! 
OCD! OCD! What've I got? 
OCD! OCD! Uh! 
Dirt on me, get your dirt off me now! 
I've got OCD, yeah! 
OCD! 
Haha, no! 
Ugh! Yuk!
