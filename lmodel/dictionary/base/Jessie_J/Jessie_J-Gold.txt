<song artist="Jessie_J" title="Gold">
Everyone dies, but not everyone lives
Everyone takes, but not everyone gives
I wanna see my name written across the sky
I'm not going up in flames, I choose to survive
So tonight we dance this rhythm
Till the light of morning hits us
We may never see a moment
As magical as this one
Like go-old
You make me feel like go-old
You make me feel like go-old
You make me feel like go-old
Show me love like I've never known (oh woah oh)
Baby you make me feel like gold
Some people wait, for love to come
Till it's too late, that won't be us
Cause there's an energy, pulling me to you
We are two hearts beating, together now, its true (oohh woah oohh)
So tonight we dance this rhythm
Till the light of morning hits us
We may never see a moment
As magical as this one
Like go-old
You make me feel like go-old
You make me feel like go-old
You make me feel like go-old
Show me love like I've never known (oh woah oh)
Baby you make me feel like gold
The way you make me feel you know it really tears me up
And every single day I pray I always give enough
Cause baby how you say my life is love and its fact
And I just wanna give it all back
Like go-old
You make me feel like go-old
You make me feel like go-old
You make me feel like go-old
Show me love like I've never known (oh woah oh)
Baby you make me feel like gold
