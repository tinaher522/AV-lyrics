<song artist="Jessie_J" title="Catwalk">
I'm walking down the catwalk,
I can't talk
Can't hide that I'm feeling bored
High heels make me really tall,
But I can't walk
But they still clap like they want more
Switch up to a tight fitted T 
And some high top kicks in pink black and green
I wanna dance, I wanna dance,
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna d-d-d-d-d-dance
Switch up to some baggy jeans
And bright coloured boxers for all to see
I wanna dance, I wanna dance,
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna d-d-d-d-d-dance
Work it  like a model 
(Yeah, yeah, yeah!)
Naomi Campbell
(Yeah, yeah, yeah!)
You're on a catwalk
(Yeah, yeah, yeah!) 
X 2
I'm going back down the runway 
I wanna run away
But it feels like the fun way
I wanna stay, i wanna stay on stage
But it's the time to change,
I'm gonna d-d-d-d-d-do my thing
Switch up to a tight fitted T 
And some high top kicks in pink black and green
I wanna dance, I wanna dance,
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna d-d-d-d-d-dance
Switch up to some baggy jeans
Dem bright coloured boxers for all to see
I wanna dance, I wanna dance,
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna d-d-d-d-d-dance
When you're like a model 
(Yeah, yeah, yeah!)
Your Naomi Campbell
(Yeah, yeah, yeah!)
You're on the catwalk
(Yeah, yeah, yeah!) 
X 2
For the beat that let me know
(1!)
Nod your head if you wanna let go
(2!)
Clap your hands if you're in the show
(3!)
Come on ladies do your thang!

I'm feelin what I'm rockin
Fly for a white chick
Lips cherry pink

Sweet shop baby some mad shopping
Swllowed down the wrong pipe

When you're like a model 
(Yeah, yeah, yeah!)

(Yeah, yeah, yeah!)
On the catwalk
(Yeah, yeah, yeah!)
