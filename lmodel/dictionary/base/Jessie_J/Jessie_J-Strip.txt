<song artist="Jessie_J" title="Strip">
Don't want your money, don't need your gold
Or all the fancy c-cars you own
Dripping in diamonds that's all you know
Did you mistake me f-for a hoe?
So why you talking me up, you're only letting me down
I'm going have to interrupt
Like whoa-o-oh
Cause honey I ain't your bitch you need to turn it around
I think it's time for a strip
Show me your love and stay up all night
Tell me your secrets and not your lies
Take it all off what you've you got inside
Baby strip, strip, strip, strip
Strip, strip, hey
This could be love if you blow my mind
Ooh don't you dare give me your disguise
Take it all off what you've got inside
Baby strip, strip, strip, strip
Strip, strip, hey
You think it's flashy, the things you do
I call it trashy and fucking rude
You say you want me, well here's a clue
Stop trying to fake it and just be you
So why you talking me up, You're only letting me down
I'm going have to interrupt
Like whoa-o-oh
Cause honey I ain't your bitch you need to turn it around
I think it's time for a strip
Show me your love and stay up all night
Tell me your secrets and not your lies
Take it all off what you've you got inside
Baby strip, strip, strip, strip
Strip, strip
This could be love if you blow my mind
Ooh don't you dare give me your disguise
Take it all off what you've got inside
Baby strip, strip, strip, strip
Strip, strip, hey-eh
Strip, strip, strip, strip
Strip, strip, strip, strip
Show me your love and stay up all night, night, night, night
Take it all off, what you've got inside
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Show me your love and stay up all night
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh baby
Show me your love and stay up all night
Tell me your secrets and not your lies
Take it all off what you've you got inside
Baby strip, strip, strip, strip
Strip, strip, hey
This could be love if you blow my mind
Ooh don't you dare give me your disguise
Take it all off what you've got inside
Baby strip, strip, strip, strip
Strip, strip
