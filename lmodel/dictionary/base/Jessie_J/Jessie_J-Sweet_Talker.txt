<song artist="Jessie_J" title="Sweet_Talker">
So talk to me, oh yeah
So talk to me, oh yeah
So talk to me, yeah
So talk to me, oh yeah
Fire but I still start
When I saw you on my way out
I rolled all my sleeves up
Let me be your situation
See you on my heart, it's a silly thing to start
I can tell you know what it takes to make me fall apart
So here we are, it's going down
Such a sweet talker, turning me around
You ain't gotta look like a movie star
Cause boy you sound so sweet, you can have it all
Talking about, a teachers pet
Baby you look cute when you make my bed
You just keep singing those lullabies
Sweet talk me all night honey pie
So talk to me, oh yeah (sweet talker, sweet talker)
So talk to me, oh yeah (sweet talker, sweet talker)
So talk to me, yeah
So talk to me, oh yeah (sweet talker, sweet talker)
Now you're a Casanova
So put your money where your mouth is
I think I'll take my heels off
You won't know what just started
See you on my heart, it's a simple thing to start
I can tell you know what it takes to make me fall apart
So here we are, it's going down
Such a sweet talker, turning me around
You ain't gotta look like a movie star
Cause boy you sound so sweet, you can have it all
Talk about, a teachers pet
Baby you look cute when you make my bed
You just keep singing those lullabies
Sweet, tell me that honey pie
So talk to me, oh yeah (sweet talker, sweet talker)
So talk to me, oh yeah (sweet talker, sweet talker)
So talk to me, yeah
So talk to me, oh yeah (sweet talker, sweet talker)
I hope you know I'm rolling solo after tonight, oh yeah
Cause I can play this game with my eyes closed
Baby, shake it up, okay
So you can make me feel so good
I'm a make you feel, talk to me yeah
So talk to me, yeah
So talk to me, talk to me, talk to me, talk to me, baby
So here we are, it's going down
Such a sweet talker, turning me around
You ain't gotta look like a movie star
Cause boy you sound so sweet, you can have it all
Talk about, a teachers pet
Baby you look cute when you make my bed
You just keep singing those lullabies
Sweet talk me all night honey pie, yeah yeah
(Sweet talker, sweet talker)
Talk to me (sweet talker, sweet talker)
Oh yeah
Sweet talker, baby (sweet talker, sweet talker)
