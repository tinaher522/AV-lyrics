<song artist="Jessie_J" title="Abracadabra">
I don't wanna be the reason,
We don't get down.
So I'ma let you do the leading,
And follow you now
See I just don't usually do this,
But you're bringing me out.
All the doubts I had have gone away
When you're touching me I'm not afraid,
Know this ain't going away, here to stay,
I just wanna be your girl
I can be all you want,
Will you say,
I just wanna be your girl, yeah.
'Cause you got my heart unlocked,
It's so unreal you know,
Don't want this to stop,
You're so damn keepable
Feel your magic touch
It's unbelievable
I gotta have you, like abracadabra
You got my heart unlocked,
It's so unreal you know,
Don't want this to stop,
You're so damn keepable
Feel your magic touch
It's unbelievable
I gotta have you, like abracadabra
I didn't even see you coming,
It was such a surprise,
I wasn't expecting nothing,
Now I'm lit up inside
You're bringing out all the colours,
No more black and white
You won the race and got the gold,
So here I am, we're good to go
Know this ain't going away, here to stay,
I just wanna be your girl
I can be all you want,
Will you say,
I just wanna be your girl, whoa yeah
'Cause you got my heart unlocked,
It's so unreal you know,
Don't want this to stop,
You're so damn keepable
Feel your magic touch
It's unbelievable
I gotta have you, like abracadabra
You got my heart unlocked,
It's so unreal you know,
Don't want this to stop,
You're so damn keepable
Feel your magic touch
It's unbelievable
I gotta have you, like abracadabra
I don't wanna take my time,
I don't wanna wait in line,
I just want you by my side
Come and give me what I like
I don't wanna take my time,
I don't wanna wait in line,
I just want you by my side
Come and give me what I like
'Cause you got my heart unlocked,
It's so unreal you know,
Don't want this to stop,
You're so damn keepable
Feel your magic touch
It's unbelievable
I gotta have you, like abracadabra
You got my heart unlocked,
It's so unreal you know,
Don't want this to stop,
You're so damn keepable
Feel your magic touch
It's unbelievable
I gotta have you, like abracadabra
Hey yeah, oh yeah, yeah.
