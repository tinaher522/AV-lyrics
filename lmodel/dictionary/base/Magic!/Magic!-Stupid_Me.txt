<song artist="Magic!" title="Stupid_Me">
Oh oh oh, oh oh, oh oh...
Stupid me, I don't know how to slow down
Felt your touch and now I want it all now
Waiting by the phone begging for a call now
Centuries go by, and still there's no sound
Why do you play with my heart, why do do do you?
When you know that I see right through through through you?
But if you don't love me the way I love you
And if you don't want me the way I want you
And if you don't need me the way I need you
I just got one thing to say to you
Stupid you
Stupid you, you don't know how to act right
Gave you the best sleep you ever had in your life
And all you had to do was kiss me goodnight
I swear to you a man like me you won't find
So why do you play with my heart, why do do do you?
When you know that I see right through through through you?
But if you don't love me the way I love you
And if you don't want me the way I want you
And if you don't need me the way I need you
I just got one thing to say to you
Stupid you
So why do you play with my heart, why do do do you?
When you know that I see right through through through you?
So if you don't love me the way I love you
And if you don't want me the way I want you
Then if you don't need me the way I need you
I just got one thing to say to you
Stupid you, ey
Stupid you, oh oh oh
Stupid me for falling for you
Stupid me for falling for you
