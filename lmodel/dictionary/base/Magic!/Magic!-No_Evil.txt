<song artist="Magic!" title="No_Evil">
(Speak no, see no, hear no evil)
Woke up in the morning to another perfect stranger
Jumped into the shower to wash off the situation
I can't tell the difference if I'm crying or it's raining
Either way I know that there is something in the change
All I could think of is you in that sundress
And if there's a chance to be with you I promise
That I will speak no evil
And I will see no darkness
And I will only hear your voice
'Til the demons come in to infect the love
(Speak no, see no, hear no evil)
'Til the demons come in to infect the love
(Speak no, see no, hear no evil)
Can you take me somewhere where the devil cannot find us?
Rid me of the poison that has only paralysed us?
I don't wanna waste another moment here without love
And I hope there's still a space in your heart for me
And all I could think of is you in that sundress
And if there's a chance to be with you I promise
That I will speak no evil
And I will see no darkness
And I will only hear your voice
'Til the demons come in to infect the love
(Speak no, see no, hear no evil)
'Til the demons come in to infect the love
(Speak no, see no, hear no evil)
And all I could think of is you in that sundress
And if there's a chance to be with you I promise
That I will speak no evil
And I will see no darkness
And I will only hear your voice
'Til the demons come in to infect the love
(Speak no, see no, hear no evil)
'Til the demons come in to infect the love
(Speak no, see no, hear no evil)
Oh, put on your sundress and meet me in the sunshine
Put on that sundress and meet me in the sunlight
(Speak no, see no, hear no evil)
No evil, whoa
(Speak no, see no, hear no evil)
