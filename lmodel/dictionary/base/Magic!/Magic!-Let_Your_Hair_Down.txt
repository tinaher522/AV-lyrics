<song artist="Magic!" title="Let_Your_Hair_Down">
There she goes, there she goes, there she goes
There's nothing better than my beautiful woman
Even though, even though, even though
It's not always heaven, we still fly together
To me you are more than just skin and bones
You are elegance and freedom and everything I know
So come on and...
Baby let your hair down
Let me run my fingers through it
We can be ourselves now
Go ahead, be foolish
No one's on the clock now
Lying in this simple moment
You don't gotta worry now
Just let your hair down
Tell me when, tell me when, tell me when
When I can steal a sweet kiss right from you
I'm diving in, I'm diving in, I'm diving in
The water's warm right here
To me you are more than just skin and bones
You are elegance and freedom and everything I know
So come on and...
Baby let your hair down
Let me run my fingers through it
We can be ourselves now
Go ahead, be foolish
No one's on the clock now
Lying in this simple moment
You don't gotta worry now
Just let your hair down
[x2]
You don't gotta worry
Let your hair down
It's only us here, only us here, only us here
It's only us here, only us here, only us here
It's only us here, only us here, it's only us here
