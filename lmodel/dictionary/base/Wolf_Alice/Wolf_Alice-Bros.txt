<song artist="Wolf_Alice" title="Bros">
Shake your hair
Have some fun
Forget our mothers and past lovers 
Forget everyone
Oh, I'm so lucky
You are my best friend 
There's no one, there's no one that knows me like you do 
(Just me and you...)
Remember when we cut our hair
Both looked like boys 
But we didn't care 
Stuck it out together like we always do 
Oh, there's no one, there's no one quite like you 
(Just me and you...)
Oh
Jump that 43
Are you wild like me
Raised by wolves and other beasts
I tell you all the time
I'm not mad
You tell me all the time 
I got plans
I got plans
Me and you
Me and you 
Me and you 
We could do better, I'm quite sure
Me and you
Me and you 
Me and you 
We could do better, I'm quite sure
Me me me, me me and you
Me me me, me me and you
