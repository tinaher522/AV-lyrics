<song artist="Wolf_Alice" title="She">
Made Dirty, blade don't care, 
I'll take anything
Watch me
Take what you will,
Wear like a stain,
Always think of her
‘Cause she was sent for 
It's so easy to rebel
(She knows, she knows, she knows)
And then celebrate myself
(She knows, she knows, she knows)
I wish She was like you
(She knows, she knows, she knows)
I wish I was you
(She knows)
She’s got a boyfriend in a band
And they do more than just hold hands,
So, so quiet, so, so pretty
From the country, loves the city
I’m a city girl born and raised
Dust in the cracks and filled with rage
Well, you can be my second hand, 
My soft coo coo when I go to bed,
Do you tell lies , do you do tricks
Do you hate your dad, is your mum a bitch
So quiet and pretty
She’s laughing, really
I had a lover, I had a friend
I don’t deliver nothing for them
You having fevers or bad dreams
I’m having neither, just live and breathe
I had a lover, I had a friend
I don’t deliver nothing for them
You having fevers or bad dreams
I’m having neither, just live and breathe
It's so easy to rebel
(She knows, she knows, she knows)
And then celebrate myself
(She knows, she knows, she knows)
I wish she was like you
(She knows, she knows, she knows)
I wish she was like you
(She knows, she knows, she knows)
I wish I was you
(She knows)
