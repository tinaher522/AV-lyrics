<song artist="Wolf_Alice" title="Soapy_Water">
I wash my face with soapy water
This guy is in tears 'cause she is somebody's daughter
They don't ever wanna see me cry
Anxiety grips are always waiting to take me
Senses pass out, I feel it starting to shake me
Is hard to live when is good to die
If I'm gonna sit and wait then I might as well
Ask for the hand of the devil limbs off
Waiting to talk what is hard to tell
So look into my eyes and see the bull's eye and the crack
But they just say hello and never look back
Waiting to talk but is hard to catch
Superstition gets me out of control
Touch my head and bless my soul
And play in a theater but my soul is just old
'Cause nothing heals, misery is bliss
No witches spell, no lovers kiss
If life is easy then what is this?
If I'm gonna sit and wait then I might as well
Ask for the hand of the devil limbs off
Waiting to talk what is hard to tell
So look into my eyes and see the bull's eye and the crack
But they just say hello and never look back
Afraid to talk but is hard to catch
Have a Smoke, put it out
Such are wounds, and is out
Start again, cut your hair
If you want to love then is hard to care
(I'll care, I'll try to care)
Dreams of relationships that come down spoiled
Go find something to wreck in this thoughts
You may not always hide, and keep good health
But that's not me, is something else
If I'm gonna sit the wait then I might as well
Ask for the hand of the devil limbs off
Waiting to talk what is hard to tell
So look into my eyes and see the bull's eye and the crack
But they just say hello and never look back
Waiting to talk but is hard to catch
