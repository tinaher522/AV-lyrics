<song artist="Wolf_Alice" title="Silk">
You brought shoulders, I'm all in tears
You're alive and I still here
Some half human creature thing
Can you bring life to anything (ooh)
(Take this and make it better)
If you don't love me, don't tell me
I never asked who and I never asked why (such a shame)
Who's fault is that, if it wasn't mom and dad
(Well it must be yours) 
Well I've known of that (ooh)
Just looking for a protector
God never reached out in time
There's love, there is a saviour
but that ain't no love of mine
My Love it kills me slowly,
Slowly I could die
And when she sleeps she hears the blues
In shades of black and white
Got to stay cool will you hot, hot head
Count to a thousand before you sleep in bed
Read the news, pass the time
Drink the juice, feeling fine
Got to stay cool will you hot, hot head
Count to a thousand before you sleep in bed
Read the news, pass the time
Drink the juice, feeling fine
(At least you're not boring)
No one wants to feel you this time!
Just looking for a protector
God never reached out in time
There's love, there is a saviour
but that ain't no love of mine
My Love it kills me slowly,
Slowly I could die
And when she sleeps she hears the blues
In shades of black and white
Just looking for a protector
God never reached out in time
There's love, there is a saviour
but that ain't no love of mine
My Love it kills me slowly,
Slowly I could die
And when she sleeps she hears the blues
In shades of black and white
