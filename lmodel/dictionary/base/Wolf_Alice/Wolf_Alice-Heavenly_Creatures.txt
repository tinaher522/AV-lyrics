<song artist="Wolf_Alice" title="Heavenly_Creatures">
We loved the pictures in our passports
Your hair is cold and I look shy
This is not a lot to ask for
Just to pray, to pray that this would be the time
Time to die
Time to kill
Time will fly
Time will heal
All for love
All for you
God’s the judge
Love is true
It’s time to die
Time to kill
Time will fly
Time will heal
All for love
All for you
God’s the judge
Love is true
Was it never enough that we should simply want to be together?
Was it never enough that we should simply want to be together?
Together, together, together
There’ll be nothing left to be afraid of
Because everything else means nothing at all
Clear your thorns for your halo
I’ll be your shadow, don’t fear a fall
Time to die
Time to kill
Time will fly
Time will heal
All for love
All for you
God’s the judge
Love is true
It’s time to die
Time to kill
Time will fly
Time will heal
All for love
All for you
God’s the judge
Love is true
Was it never enough that we should simply want to be together?
Was it never enough that we should simply want to be together?
Together, together, together
