<song artist="Wolf_Alice" title="Storms">
I read my name on the bar front door
I once yearned
Afraid to seek more
Close my eyes on this violet night
I'm still here
Dead in your life
Time doesn't slow
The world won't lend hands
What you've got to show
And who are your friends
Your friends, your friends
Your friends, your friends
Your friends, your friends
Your friends, your friends
Your friends, your friends
Your friends, your friends
Your friends, your friends
Your friends, your friends
Your friends
For black paint says nobody cares
That I was here
Yeah, I'm full well aware
That I'm a slave to my demons
And my demons are dead
Excuses to stay, and my demon's my friend
So fight me, find me
Send me an angel
Time doesn't slow
The world won't lend hands
What you've got to show
And who are your friends
Your friends, your friends
Your friends, your friends
Your friends, your friends
Your friends, your friends
Your friends, your friends
Your friends, your friends
Your friends, your friends
Your friends, your friends
Your friends
Your friends
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
