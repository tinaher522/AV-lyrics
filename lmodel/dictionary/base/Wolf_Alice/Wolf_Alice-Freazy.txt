<song artist="Wolf_Alice" title="Freazy">
Long were the days 
Where the window held the deepest of my 
Thoughts it's okay 
I found my place
Found on the way 
To the place I never really thought I'd go
It's okay
You were there in the back of my brain
Did you really wanna with Alice?
Did you really wanna like a wolf?
You can hate us all you want but
It don't mean nothing at all
You can join us if you think you're wild
You can join us if you're a feral child
Our love is cool
I built the paths 
That I took in my head over and over again
Step to step, to the light at the end
Oh make believe
I was a prisoner to my thoughts throughout my teens
Look at me, I don't read in between
Did you really wanna with Alice?
Did you really wanna like a wolf?
You can hate us all you want but
It don't mean nothing at all
You can join us if you think you're wild
You can join us if you're a feral child
Our love is cool
I will meet you where the grass is greener
Hands on the clock, no I ain't watchin' them either
I will meet you where the grass is greener
Hands on the clock, no I ain't watchin' them either
I will meet you where the grass is greener
Did you really wanna with Alice?
Did you really wanna like a wolf?
You can hate us all you want but
It don't mean nothing at all
You can join us if you think you're wild
You can join us if you're a feral child
Our love is cool
I will meet you where the grass is greener
Did you really wanna with Alice?
Did you really wanna like a wolf?
You can hate us all you want but
It don't mean nothing at all
You can join us if you think you're wild
You can join us if you're a feral child
Our love is cool
