<song artist="Wolf_Alice" title="You're_A_Germ">
George he rides a bike
To pick her up from school
He likes her 'cause she's pure
She likes him 'cause she's heard he's cool
You're a germ, twist my insides
You're a germ, we hear the fight
This is not exploring, when you are dead inside
What were you before him? (eyes wide, eyes wide)
Makes me squirm, twist my insides
Makes me squirm
We hear the one! two! three! four! five! six! seven!
You ain't going to heaven (eyes wide, eyes wide)
'Cause I'm dragging you down to hell (eyes wide, eyes wide)
Where's Mom and Dad so you can tell them (eyes wide, eyes wide)
You're a dodgy fucker as well? (eyes wide, eyes wide)
George he takes to the mic
Plays the same songs every year
His leather looks pretty cheap
And the clock gives somehow fear
You're a creep, twist my insides
You're a creep
We hear the one! two! three! four! five! six! seven!
You ain't going to heaven (eyes wide, eyes wide)
'Cause I'm dragging you down to hell (eyes wide, eyes wide)
Where's Mom and Dad so you can tell them (eyes wide, eyes wide)
You're a dodgy fucker as well? (eyes wide, eyes wide)
You ain't going to heaven (eyes wide, eyes wide)
'Cause I'm dragging you down to hell (eyes wide, eyes wide)
Where's Mom and Dad so you can tell them (eyes wide, eyes wide)
Tell them you're a dodgy fucker as well? Yes you are! (eyes wide, eyes wide)
