<song artist="Wolf_Alice" title="Turn_To_Dust">
Keep your beady eyes on me
To make sure I don't turn to dust
If fear is in the mind, then my mind lives in fear
as deep in this voice then a dirty British sea
Keep your beady eyes on me
To make sure I don't turn to dust
There's paths to make that be
And paths where I get scared
And paths to thread lightly with the clouds beneath my feet
(Oooh)
And the light keep falling, the blinds are dancing with everyone
It's just so passive, tiny hands with everyone
Keep your beady eyes on me
To make sure I don't turn to dust
