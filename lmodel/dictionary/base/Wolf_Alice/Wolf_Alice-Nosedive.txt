<song artist="Wolf_Alice" title="Nosedive">
We fail making beats for you to dance to
We fail making rhymes to romance to
We failed on our making it naked alright
We fail making beats for you to dance to
We fail making rhymes to romance to
We failed on our making it naked alright
Nosedive
Nosedive
Nosedive
Nosedive
I've got a fiver in a pocket somewhere
I can make it to yours on time
I don't care if this takes me no where
I won't, and you won't, we won't ask why
Nosedive
Nosedive
Nosedive
Nosedive
You play the drums
You play the drums and we'll make the rhymes
figured it out
I figured it all and we'll be alright
Who's there?
Who cares?
Go out and dance
I can dance if you do too
Gimme the five
We have our love and we'll be alright
Who's there?
Who cares?
