<song artist="Wolf_Alice" title="Your_Loves_Whore">
Don't you want to take time and get to love me
We could build a perfect world
I got tricks I really want to show you
I could be your perfect girl, all right
And when we grow older
We'll still be friends
We'll could still be lovers
And we won't fear the end
Life we'll figure and the light won't fade, believe me
And it all looks better in the place we made believe
Hearts keep pumping and there's one thing
That keeps me breathing
Is the mentor I've seen and face I'll always see
And when we grow older
We'll still be friends
We'll still be lovers
And we won't fear the end
And when we grow older (Oooh)
We'll still be friends (Oooh)
We'll could still be lovers (Oooh)
And we won't fear the end (Oooh)
I let your love take me
Now I am your love's whore
Keep me hardly breathing
But, I can only love you more
I can only love you more
I can only love you more
I can only love you more
I can only love you more
Ah, ah, ah, ah
