<song artist="Wolf_Alice" title="Fluffy">
You look smart, but I don't care
I'm not looking for no love affair
I'd sell you my soul just to get me somewhere
What's there to do in this dead old town?
No I can't believe I live here now
So I'm searching for cheap thrills and we don't know how
Sixteen!
So sweet!
Sixteen!
So sweet!
Send me your laugh
Make you bright and early
What makes you smile just makes me feel funny
So who's gonna love me, where's all the money?
What's there to do?
I got nothing in this dead old town
No I can't believe I live here now
So I'm searching for cheap thrills and we don't know how
Sixteen!
So sweet!
Sixteen!
So sweet!
