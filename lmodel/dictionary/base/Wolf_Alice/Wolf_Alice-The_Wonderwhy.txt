<song artist="Wolf_Alice" title="The_Wonderwhy">
What happens when we die?
No don't ask questions,
Just make sure you survive
Now give me faith so I have boxes to take
And we won't have to suffer the wonderwhy
The longer days when I don't give up
And all the lovers secrets pleasures
And I found through and since I have the time
I'm going with my things through this fire
Don't leave me here when I'm not sold
Don't leave me here when I'm not sold
Don't leave me here when I'm not sold
Don't leave me here when I'm not sold
Don't leave me here when I'm not sold
Don't leave me here when I'm not sold
Don't leave me here when I'm not sold
Don't leave me here when I'm not sold
Don't leave me here this place is for savage
Shot to pieces back in the heaven
Back in hell fire and running in the gate
Starting a riot and plan an escape
Babies growing up asking questions
Looking for help for life and lessons
Babies growing up life exposure
Drinking the milk, Look under the bedroom
Don't leave me here when I'm not sold
Don't leave me here when I'm not sold
Don't leave me here when I'm not sold
Don't leave me here when I'm not sold
Don't leave me here when I'm not sold
Don't leave me here when I'm not sold
Don't leave me here when I'm not sold
Don't leave me here when I'm not sold
