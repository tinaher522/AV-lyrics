<song artist="Wolf_Alice" title="Blush">
Curse the things that made me sad for so long
Yeah it hurts to think that they can still go on
I'm happy now
Are you happy now?
Spoke out the things that youâ€˜ve worked out to be wrong
You got two hands to take all you can, but don't take too long
To be happy somehow
Are you happy now?
Figured out I'm good
Turn me down like I knew I should
Punch drunk, dumb struck, pot luck happy happy
Don't chicken out, it's all good
You're allowed to be what you could
Punch drunk, dumb struck, pot luck happy happy
Punch drunk, dumb struck, pot luck happy happy
Punch drunk, dumb struck, pot luck happy happy
Figured out I'm good
Turn me down like I knew I should
Happy now
Punch drunk, dumb struck, pot luck happy happy
Don't chicken out, it's all good
You're allowed to be what you could
I feel good
I feel good
I feel good
I feel good
Curse the things that made me sad for so long
Yeah it hurts to think that they can still go on
I'm happy now
Are you happy now?
