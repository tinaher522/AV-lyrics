<song artist="Wolf_Alice" title="Swallowtail">
Swallowtail, I met you up atop the shard
As we fell, I never thought we'd hit this hard
It's not right, but it's too late for that now
Swallow fear, and head straight into the ground
And head straight into the ground
Ground that you've been leaning on
To the ground,
Ground that you've believed we'll go
Swallowtail, I met you up atop the shard
As we fell, I never thought we'd hit this hard
It's not right, but it's too late for that now
Swallow fear, and head straight into the ground
And head straight into the ground
Ground that you've been leaning on
To the ground,
Ground that you've believed we'll go
Swallowtail, I met you up atop the shard
As we fell, I never thought we'd hit this hard
It's not right, but it's too late for that now
Swallow fear, and head straight into the ground
And head straight into the ground
Ground that you've been leaning on
To the ground,
Ground that you've believed we'll go
