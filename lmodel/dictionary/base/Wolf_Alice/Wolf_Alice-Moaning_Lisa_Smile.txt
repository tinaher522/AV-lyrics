<song artist="Wolf_Alice" title="Moaning_Lisa_Smile">
Clinging to love, escape her father and mother
She hopes there's some other way out of the hole
She’s overachieving, chasing her dreams
And coming down slowly, yeah it’s out of control
Scrap the blues, if the blues don’t work
Flash your teeth, though the inside hurts
Scrap the blues, if the blues don’t work
Does it make you feel better just because you feel worse?
All of the books and all of the blood and
Nowhere to run 'cause it's out of control
You wait for something to undo these feelings
Waiting and waiting but it’s out of control
Scrap the blues, if the blues don’t work
Flash your teeth, though the inside hurts
Scrap the blues, if the blues don’t work
Does it make you feel better just because you feel worse?
It never is enough
No, it never is enough
It never is enough
No, it never is enough
