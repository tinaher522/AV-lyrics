<song artist="Wolf_Alice" title="We're_Not_The_Same">
Long live, you're amazing
Long live, I am strange!
We'll walk Mondays together,
Your way
Well, aren't you feeling brave?
We're not the same,
You and I!
Oh, what a shame,
Bye-bye!
We're not the same,
You and I!
Oh, what a shame,
Bye-bye!
Meet me at queen Caroline,
I'll meet you anywhere!
Left me down and broken
Your way
Well, aren't you feeling scared?
We're not the same,
You and I!
Oh, what a shame,
Bye-bye!
We're not the same,
You and I!
Oh, what a shame,
Bye-bye!
