<song artist="Charli_XCX" title="London_Queen">
Ride away from Holloway 
I said, Mom, this isn't a holiday 
Listen up, I ain't coming back 
Till I can fill the shack up with all gold plaques
Soon come, home run
Knock it out the park with a baseball bat 
When I'm driving on the wrong side of the road
I feel like JFK, you know
I never thought I'd be living in the USA
Doing things the American way
I never thought I'd be living in the USA
Living the dream like a London Queen
Now I live in Hollywood
I can't stop, even though I know I should
It feels so good, oh yeah, oh oh
When I'm driving on the wrong side of the road
I feel like JFK, you know
I never thought I'd be living in the USA
Doing things the American way
I never thought I'd be living in the USA
Living the dream like a London Queen
I never thought I'd be living in the USA
Doing things the American way
I never thought I'd be living in the USA
Living the dream like a London Queen
Living the dream like a London Queen (ay)
Living the dream like a London Queen (ay)
Living the dream like a London Queen (ay)
Living the dream like a London Queen 
I never thought I'd be living in the USA 
Doing things the American way 
I never thought I'd be living in the USA 
Living the dream like a London Queen 
I never thought I'd be living in the USA 
Doing things the American way 
I never thought I'd be living in the USA 
Living the dream like a London Queen 
Living the dream like a London Queen (ay)
Living the dream like a London Queen (ay)
Living the dream like a London Queen (ay)
Living the dream like a London Queen
