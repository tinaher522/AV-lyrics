<song artist="Charli_XCX" title="Yet_Again">
She listens to Yellowcard
Just to fit in with her friends
'Cause they all know all the words
So she sings along just to click with them and
She tries to straighten her naturally curly hair
But it don't work, oh no, it don't
It just looks like a pile of shite on top of her head
Well, yes, yes, yes I'm banging on about her again (and again and again and again)
'Cause I can't get those things she's been sayin' off my brain
And this time I ain't mentionin' no names (no names, no names, no names)
'Cause that would make it too damn obvious (yeah)
She helps out all the drunks who don't really want to know
Just so she looks like some kind of Good Samaritan and
She gets her friends to break up her enemies' girlfriends and boyfriends
And that kind of thing that they've got going on
Well, yes, yes, yes I'm banging on about her again (and again and again and again)
'Cause I can't get those things she's been sayin' off my brain
And this time I ain't mentionin' no names (no names, no names, no names)
'Cause that would make it too damn obvious (yeah)
(1, 2, 3, ow)
Well, she used to have a lot of love
But I reckon she fucked it up and
I reckon she was one of 'em over-possessive types of girl
Comes up to her man, calls out 'Sam' and she turns all catty, hisses and scratches them away
Oh, yes, yes, yes I'm banging on about her again (and again and again and again)
'Cause I can't get those things she's been sayin' off my brain
And this time I ain't mentionin' no names (no names, no names, no names)
'Cause that would make it too damn obvious (yeah)
Well, yes, yes, yes I'm banging on about her again (and again and again and again)
'Cause I can't get those things she's been sayin' off my brain
And this time I ain't mentionin' no names (no names, no names, no names)
'Cause that would make it too damn obvious
