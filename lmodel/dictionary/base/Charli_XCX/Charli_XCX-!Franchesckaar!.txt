!Franchesckaar!
They all love you
!Franchesckaar!
They all want you
!Franchesckaar!
Of course they do
!Franchesckaar!
Oh yes, it's true
!Franchesckaar!
They love your skin
!Franchesckaar!
They want your hair
!Franchesckaar!
They want your eyes
!Franchesckaar!
I tell no lies
Jack Wills, clipped hair, penciled eyes, you get attention
Tight shirt, straight teeth, pinned up smile, all of them mention
"Hi, you look nice", tip-top, beautiful, the cat's pajamas
Suntan, golden brown, where you been to? The Bahamas
Oh, but you can't see it, babe
Oh, you just see through it all
Oh, the girls turn green when they see you
'Cause all of the boys start to call
!Franchesckaar!
They all love you
!Franchesckaar!
They all want you
!Franchesckaar!
Of course they do
!Franchesckaar!
Oh yes, it's true
!Franchesckaar!
They love your skin
!Franchesckaar!
They want your hair
!Franchesckaar!
They want your eyes
!Franchesckaar!
You've got your blue eyes, pink lips, Ugg boots, and lots of passion
Acoustic, iPod, soft sounds, music fashion
Sloan style, neck scarves, clingy friends all around you
You're the icon, shine out, watch what you do
Oh, but you can't feel it, babe
The effect you have on all of them
Oh, everyone stops and stares
And then the boys begin to call
!Franchesckaar!
They all love you
!Franchesckaar!
They all want you
!Franchesckaar!
Of course they do
!Franchesckaar!
Oh yes, it's true
!Franchesckaar!
They love your skin
!Franchesckaar!
They want your hair
!Franchesckaar!
They want your eyes
!Franchesckaar!
I tell no lies
!Franchesckaar!
They all love you
!Franchesckaar!
They all want you
!Franchesckaar!
Of course they do
!Franchesckaar!
Oh yes, it's true
!Franchesckaar!
They love your skin
!Franchesckaar!
They want your hair
!Franchesckaar!
They want your eyes
!Franchesckaar!
I tell no lies
'Cause they want you
And they need you
And they love you
And they crave you
'Cause they want you
And they need you
And they love you
Love you
!Franchesckaar!
They love you, yeah, yeah
They love you
!Franchesckaar!
They want you, yeah, yeah
They want you
!Franchesckaar!
They want your skin, your hair, your eyes
!Franchesckaar!
I don't tell no lies, no
!Franchesckaar!
They all love you
!Franchesckaar!
They all want you
!Franchesckaar!
Of course they do
