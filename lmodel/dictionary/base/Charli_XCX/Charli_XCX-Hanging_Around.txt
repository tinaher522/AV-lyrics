<song artist="Charli_XCX" title="Hanging_Around">
Help me out, I need escape
It's the truth, I got to go
With all the boys in the back I lay
And all my girls in the superstore
Because we need electricity
City lights gotta glow for me
And we're more than a copper queen
So get your shit now, we got to roll
Let's go out of this town
Too bored, hanging around
Sky high, head in the clouds
Never gonna come down (oh)
Drums, bass, turn em up loud
Free fall, spinning around
Sky high, head in the clouds
Never gonna come down
Take the car and cut the brakes
Driving out into the dark
Even though I love mom and dad
I wanna swim out there with the sharks
I wanna learn to speak Japanese
Razor-sharp on the silver screen
We were made for a limousine
So get your shit now and come with me
Let's go out of this town
Too bored, hanging around
Sky high, head in the clouds
Never gonna come down
Drums, bass, turn em up loud
Free fall, spinning around
Sky high, head in the clouds
Never gonna come down
Blowing bubbles out in the grass
All tangled in the stars, getting faded in the back seat
You can be hanging with us
We used to walk around the bad streets, when I'm causing all the heat
Fuck a dream, I want it for real
Always make it look so easy, move in to the city
Take a little sip of surreal
We're much more than nothing, yeah, we're all just trying to be who we feel
Throwing make-up in the air, we don't care, no
Surfing on a silver lake, wanna let go
We're so bored of being here, we don't care, no
I wanna run, be wild and free
And with my friends standing next to me
Let's go out of this town
Too bored, hanging around
Sky high, head in the clouds
Never gonna come down
Drums, bass, turn em up loud
Free fall, spinning around
Sky high, head in the clouds
Never gonna come down
Hey
Ooh ah ah, ooh ah ah
Hanging a-, hanging a-
Hey
Ooh ah ah, ooh ah ah
Hanging a-, hanging around
Hey
Ooh ah ah, ooh ah ah
Hanging a-, hanging a-
Hey
Ooh ah ah, ooh ah ah
Hanging a-, hanging around
