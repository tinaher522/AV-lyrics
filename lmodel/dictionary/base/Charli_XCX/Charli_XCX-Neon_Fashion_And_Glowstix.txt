(I can't believe you actually said to me,
"I am the one who made you."
Who do you really think you are?)
You know you're making this more complicated than before
You know you're making me hate you more than I've ever done before
'Cause there's no way that you're allowed to say that you built me up
'Cause I was already made this way
Oh, look what you've done now 
Just back down, yeah, back down
'Cause I don't want you and your skinny jeans hanging around
I was made to apologize, but I didn't mean it
'Cause that tee-shirt that you got me, I don't want it
You can keep it
We messed it up, yeah
Both too proud to back down from the battle
Now we've got our neons on and our glowsticks out
Trying to fight it out
To see who's more individual
We know that's what it's about, yeah
So what you gonna do when I leave you?
You'll have no one who wants to play along with your silly little rules
'Cause you look up to someone much older and bolder who barely knows you
And they only want to talk to you so they can steal your cardigans and your Air Force Ones
Oh, look what you've done now 
Just back down, yeah, back down
'Cause I don't want you and your skinny jeans hanging around
I was made to apologize, but I didn't mean it
'Cause that tee-shirt that you got me, I don't want it
You can keep it
We messed it up, yeah
Both too proud to back down from the battle
Now we've got our neons on and our glowsticks out
Trying to fight it out
To see who's more individual
You've got your glowsticks and all your, you know, your flashy little things
You've got your Spiderman stickers, your brown hair, your polka-dots
Just leave it out, leave it out
I told you, we're both the same
Both as guilty as each other
Do you remember when we went to see that band?
We couldn't stand and dance around 'cause you got a seated ticket
And I remember when we used to hold hands
Skip along and try to get ourÂ ??? like
I remember when you used to call my name
And we'd play those cheating games behind people's backs
But we lost out in the neon competition
'Cause that's what it was really about
(Game Over)
