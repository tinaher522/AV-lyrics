<song artist="Charli_XCX" title="Caught_In_The_Middle">
Our hearts got caught in the middle
Caught in the middle of love
Our hearts got caught in the middle
Caught in the middle of love
Took the plane at five
Flew across the world, I'm the other girl
The one who's in your head
Laid there by your side
In the city nights, naked in the lights
Hiding secrets in your bed
'Cause we tried to turn around
But we couldn't stop it now
Our hearts got caught in the middle
Caught in the middle of love
You're stuck on my mind
Push restart, press rewind
Our hearts got caught in the middle
Caught in the middle of love
Our hearts got caught in the middle
Caught in the middle of love
Lost inside the line
Stare across the room, almost falling through
Never make the same mistake
Harder every time
Wish we could be true, always wanting you
We gotta stay a mystery
Oh, I'm caught in the middle
Caught in the middle of
'Cause we tried to turn around
But we couldn't stop it now
Our hearts got caught in the middle
Caught in the middle of love
You're stuck on my mind
Push restart, press rewind
Our hearts got caught in the middle
Caught in the middle of love
Our hearts got caught in the middle
Caught in the middle of love
Our hearts got caught in the middle
Caught in the middle of love
Oh, I'm caught in the middle, caught in the middle of
'Cause we all are caught in the middle, caught in the middle of
'Cause we all are caught in the middle, caught in the middle of
'Cause we all are caught in the middle, caught in the middle of
'Cause we tried to turn around
But we couldn't stop it now
Our hearts got caught in the middle
Caught in the middle of love
You're stuck on my mind
Push restart, press rewind
Our hearts got caught in the middle
Caught in the middle of love
Our hearts got caught in the middle
Caught in the middle of love
Our hearts got caught in the middle
Caught in the middle of love
