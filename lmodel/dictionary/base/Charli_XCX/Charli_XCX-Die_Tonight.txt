<song artist="Charli_XCX" title="Die_Tonight">
Oh whoa, I could die tonight
'Cause I got the magic in my veins
And I'm going hard with all my friends
I could die tonight
Let's get it started, pool side of the party
Rolling Stones on my phone
Hanging in your bedroom, feeling like we're rock n' roll
End of the summer, up and down with lovers
Laying under stars that shine
Hold up our palms now, don't you know that it's our time?
Oh whoa, I could die tonight
'Cause I got the magic in my blood
And I'm staying till the sun comes up
Oh whoa, I could die tonight
'Cause I got the magic in my veins
And I'm going hard with all my friends
I could die tonight
Back at the hotel, ringing off the doorbells
Now we're feeling so alive
Come to the top floor, jumping like we're 'bout to fly
No one's leaving, 'bout to blow the ceiling
When we turn it up to ten
Wake up in the morning, gonna do it all again
Oh whoa, I could die tonight
'Cause I got the magic in my blood
And I'm staying till the sun comes up
Oh whoa, I could die tonight
'Cause I got the magic in my veins
And I'm going hard with all my friends
I could die tonight
Oh whoa, I could die tonight
'Cause I got the magic in my blood
And I'm staying till the sun comes up
Oh whoa, I could die tonight
'Cause I got the magic in my veins
And I'm going hard with all my friends
I could die tonight
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
(Die tonight)
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
(Die tonight)
