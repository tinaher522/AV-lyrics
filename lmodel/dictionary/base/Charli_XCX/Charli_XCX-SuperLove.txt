<song artist="Charli_XCX" title="SuperLove">
You're whisky, wasted and beautiful, dancing through the fire
You're such a vision to see
I used to think that the power of love was just a song
But now it's got hold of me
S.O.S., is it me or is this dangerous?
Killed me with your touch
You're smoking through my blood
R.I.P., set me free, yeah this is dangerous
I can't get enough
Wanna fall into your superlove
Yeah, my heart never wants it to stop, please save me
'Cause I never seem to get enough
You're the bullet and you're making me drop, please save me
So give me all of your superlove
'Cause my body is so close to you, I'm waiting
Die here in your arms, fallin' in love with you
Feels like I'm tripping, I'm falling hard from the highest heights
When I crash, where will you be?
I think your hair looks much better pushed over to one side
How do you feel about me?
S.O.S., this is real and this is dangerous
You're my favourite drug
I smoke you in the car
R.I.P., what a dream, you're so damn dangerous
I can't get enough
Wanna fall into your superlove
Yeah, my heart never wants it to stop, please save me
'Cause I never seem to get enough
You're the bullet and you're making me drop, please save me
So give me all of your superlove
'Cause my body is so close to you, I'm waiting
Die here in your arms, fallin' in love with you
Wanna fall into your superlove
'Cause I never seem to get enough
So give me all of your superlove, I'm ready
Die here in your arms, fallin' in love with you
Wanna fall into your superlove
Yeah, my heart never wants it to stop, please save me
'Cause I never seem to get enough
You're the bullet and you're making me drop, please save me
So give me all of your superlove
'Cause my body is so close to you, I'm waiting
Die here in your arms, fallin' in love with you
Wanna fall into your superlove
Yeah, my heart never wants it to stop, please save me
'Cause I never seem to get enough
You're the bullet and you're making me drop, please save me
So give me all of your superlove
'Cause my body is so close to you, I'm waiting
Die here in your arms, fallin' in love with you
