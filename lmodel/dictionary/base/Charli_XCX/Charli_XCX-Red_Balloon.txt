<song artist="Charli_XCX" title="Red_Balloon">
Ah-ooh! If you got troubles, let 'em go
Let 'em soar so high, high into the sky just like a red balloon
Ah-ooh! Don't let your worries get to you
Let 'em float on by, high into the sky just like a red balloon
Monday morning, shoot up like a rocket
Yeah the sun is shining, keep it in my pocket
Got this golden feeling, never gonna stop, it just goes on and on
Keep on clapping, join the celebration
Turn the music louder on my favorite station
Wanna spread my magic all across the nation, do it all day long
Today I open my eyes, now I'm so happy and free
I got my friends by my side and that's all that matters to me
So come on, get up and join in 'cause this is just what you need
Let's do it all day long
Today I open my eyes, now I'm so happy and free
I got my friends by my side and that's all that matters to me
So come on, get up and join in 'cause this is just what you need
Let's do it all day long
Ah-ooh! If you got troubles, let 'em go
Let 'em soar so high, high into the sky just like a red balloon
Ah-ooh! Don't let your worries get to you
Let 'em float on by, high into the sky just like a red balloon
So turn it up now! (Ah-ooh!)
So turn it up now! (Ah-ooh!)
Bees are buzzing, birds are flying and dancing
And the trees are humming, birds are singing songs
Oh can't you see it's lovely? Life is beautiful and it goes on and on
Today I open my eyes, now I'm so happy and free
I got my friends by my side and that's all that matters to me
So come on, get up and join in 'cause this is just what you need
Let's do it all day long
Today I open my eyes, now I'm so happy and free
I got my friends by my side and that's all that matters to me
So come on, get up and join in 'cause this is just what you need
Let's do it all day long
Ah-ooh! If you got troubles, let 'em go
Let 'em soar so high, high into the sky just like a red balloon
Ah-ooh! Don't let your worries get to you
Let 'em float on by, high into the sky just like a red balloon
So turn it up now! (Ah-ooh!)
So turn it up now! (Ah-ooh!)
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah (So turn it up now!)
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
