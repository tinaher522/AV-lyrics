<song artist="Charli_XCX" title="Breaking_Up">
You say you love me, I say "what?"
You say you love me, okay, let's rock
You say you love me, I say "what?"
You say you love me, okay, let's rock
You had an ugly tattoo and fucking cheap perfume
You couldn't dance, barely move, I didn't know what to do
You had a friend in a band but they're not that cool
You say you love me, okay, let's rock
Everything was wrong with you
So breaking up was easy to do
Hate your friends and your family too
So breaking up was easy to do
Breaking up
Breaking up
Breaking up
Breaking up
You say you love me, I say "what?"
You say you love me, okay, let's rock
You say you love me, I say "what?"
You say you love me, okay, let's rock
You try to pull us apart and make a brand new start
You try to drive me, force me, you didn't get very much
You said I laugh like a baby, you're not so sure
You say you love me, okay, let's rock
Everything was wrong with you
So breaking up was easy to do
Hate your friends and your family too
So breaking up was easy to do
Everything was wrong with you
So breaking up was easy to do
Hate your friends and your family too
So breaking up was easy to do
Breaking up
Breaking up
Breaking up
Breaking up
