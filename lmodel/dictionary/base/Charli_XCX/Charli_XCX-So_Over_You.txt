<song artist="Charli_XCX" title="So_Over_You">
Everything I gave boy you'd break it
I was so hurt that my heart couldn't take it
You used to tell me without you I wouldn't make it
But boy you should know
I'm so over you, it's crazy
Taking your number off out my phone
Boy I'm doing just fine alone
Can't believe I called you baby
Boy you should know
I'm so over you
