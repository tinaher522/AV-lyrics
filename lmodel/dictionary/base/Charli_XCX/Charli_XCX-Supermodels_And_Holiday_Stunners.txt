<song artist="Charli_XCX" title="Supermodels_And_Holiday_Stunners">
Now, if I have to be honest with ya
I thought you did fancy me just a little bit.
It was like one of life's twisted love-tales
That endings didn't quite fit, but...
You were different,
A rock and roll troll, 
With your hair greased up, all in leather.
And I was a pretty girl,
Polka dots, hair in curls,
Close friends all quite clever.
It didn't really happen to start with.
I have to say I thought that maybe I was wrong
And you liked the girl you met on holiday
More than you liked me.
But then I thought, hey
What does she have to offer
That I don't?
Three rolls-royces and a cruise boat,
But you picked the tramp over the queen.
And you know...
I actually liked you.
You made me laugh lots,
Made me giggle when I sip my drink,
Made me put more effort into my lyrics.
It didn't really happen to start with.
I have to say I thought
That you were still obsessed 
By the model stunners
Like Lily Cole 
And that Brazilian chick.
Whoa, oh, uh-oh, oh.
What do you say
When you think it's time
To walk away?
Just turn around 
And wave goodbye?
Or come and politely
Kiss me on the cheek
By my side?
Now that it's over,
Will you take my picture off
Your wall, 
Fill it with the holiday girl
And Lily Cole
Or will you just leave me there 
To hang unpeacefully?
Oh, oh, oh-oh.
