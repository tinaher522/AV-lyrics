<song artist="Charli_XCX" title="Lucy">
You see, the thing about her
She's just a bit too young, I think, personally
I don't really think she's ready for this kind of commitment yet
But whatever, you know what I mean?
It's your life, isn't it?
Bitch
When you first walked in the room, I had this feeling
You were gonna build me up then slowly tear me down
But then I looked behind the framework and all of the glitz and gleams in your eyes (yeah, yeah)
'Cause you're just a bad bad girl with no brains inside your head (no)
Keep givin' it all this talk and let you know it
But you don't know shit
'Cause people cringe when you tell 'em a crazy fact (ha ha)
The way the words pour out don't make you sound all that
'Cause Lucy, no one wants you here
Yeah Lucy, no one wants you here (no, they don't, no)
Yeah Lucy, no one wants you here (ha ha ha)
Yeah Lucy, no one wants you here (yeah)
The way you were slagging me up before you even met me
With your preppy ex-boyfriend might just want two eyes
Way I caught you whisperin' and lookin' me up and down
Subtlety is clearly not your game
You're a mixed up girl with no real friends in life
You get mouthy in a second but pipe down, it don't work on me
'Cause people laugh when you get mad (ha ha)
Tellin' people how to run their lives is really quite sad (yeah)
'Cause Lucy, no one wants you here (no they don't, nope)
Yeah Lucy, no one wants you here (no they don't, no)
Yeah Lucy, no one wants you here (oh, yeah)
Yeah Lucy, no one wants you here (yeah)
I'll do what I want
Get out of my way
Don't just stand there saying what you want to say (move)
Get out of my face (move)
'Cause you got it wrong (ugh)
Just move along now on your own (get out of here)
Don't get on my nerves (yeah)
I've got my contacts (get out of my way)
Don't try and control me 'cause you'll get knocked back
Back into your place, right where you belong
Lucy, take a good listen to this song (yeah)
Lucy, no one wants you here (no they don't, no one wants you, just go)
Lucy, no one wants you here (no they don't want you)
Lucy, no one wants you here (she doesn't want you, I don't want you, just go)
Yeah, Lucy, no one wants you here (yeah, yeah)
Yeah, Lucy, no one wants you here (just leave me alone, go away)
Lucy, no one wants you here (no they don't want you)
Lucy, no one wants you here
Yeah, Lucy, no one wants you here (yeah, ha ha ha)
