<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="Soggy_Pretzels">
You were cryin' in your pretzels when I met you
You were washing
All the salt away from the dough
You were cryin' in your pretzels
And I'll never forget you
But, baby, just why, I'll ever know
Cryin' in your pretzels
Cryin' in your beer
Cryin' on the table
That's where I found you dear
[Spoken:]
Yes, my sweet I came into that bar
It was in Mississippi
There you were, sitting in the corner
Crying in your pretzels
You'd already sogged up
A whole plate of potato chips
But the management didn't mind
Because you were a regular customer
And I saw you sittin' there and I said
"That person needs a friend,
And I'm gonna be a friend
Ain't nobody deserves to cry in his pretzels
All night and wash away the salt."
So I kinda sided up to you and I said,
"What can I do for you? How can I help you?
What can I do to ease the pain?"
Well, you were cryin' in your pretzels
Oh, you were cryin' in your beer
Yes, that was the night I meet you
And I'll always hold you near
