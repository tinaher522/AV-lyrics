<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="Dance_Of_The_Sabres">
Sabre dance,
When Death plays the game of chance.
Dance, sabre dance!
Oh, sweet romance,
The flashing of sabres dance!
Dance, sabre dance!
Dance, sabre, dance!
Come on now;
Dance, sabre, dance!
Dance, sabre, dance!
Come on now:
Dance, sabre, dance!
Dance, sabre, dance! Come on now:
Dance, sabre, dance!
Sabre dance,
While Death plays the game of chance,
The flashing of sabres dance
For honor and swee romance.
Come dance, sabre, dance!
