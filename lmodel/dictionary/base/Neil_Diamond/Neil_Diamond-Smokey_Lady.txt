Smokey Lady
Spend your time
Makin' full grown men a full grown baby
Move on, move on,
Move on, move on, move on
But I'm just settlin'
'Cause I've been gettin' what I ain't had lately
Smokey Lady, what you do to me
Got me goin'
Night time women
Half not carin', half not knowin'
Come on, come on,
Come on, come on, come on
Have a good time flyin', half die tryin'
Come on and take me Smokey Lady,
See what you can see
Smokey Lady run before me,
Run behind me
Where you're goin'
Come on, come on,
Come on, come on, come on
Have good time flyin', half die tryin'
Come on and take me Smokey Lady,
See what you can see
Smokey Lady
Smokey Lady
