<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="Runnin'_Free">
Travelin' with the sun, that's where I'll be
I'm always on the run
Runnin' Free
Runnin' Free, wind whistlin' through my hair
Callin' to me
Follow me if you dare
Runnin' Free
Runnin' Free
Well a man wasn't made to lie in the shade
Dreaming of far away things
He was born to be free
That's a man's destiny
He can't live if he's tied to strings
Follow the river's flow down to the sea
I'm always on the go,
Runnin' Free
Runnin' Free
