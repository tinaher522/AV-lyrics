<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="Feels_Like_Home">
Something in your eyes
Makes me want to lose myself
Makes me want to lose myself
In your arms
There's something in your voice
Makes my heart beat fast
Hope this feeling lasts
The rest of my life
If you knew how lonely my life has been
And how low I've felt for so long
If you knew how I wanted someone
To come along
And change my life the way you've done
Feels like home to me
Feels like home to me
Feels like I'm all the way back where I come from
Feels like home to me
Feels like home to me
Feels like I'm all the way back where I belong
A window breaks
Down a long dark street
And a siren wails in the night
But I'm alright 'cause I have you here with me
And I can almost see
Through the dark there's a light
If you knew how much this moment
Means to me
And how long I've waited for your touch
If you knew how happy you are making me
I never thought I'd love anyone so much
Feels like home to me
Feels like home to me
Feels like I'm all the way back
Where I come from
Feels like home to me
Feels like home to me
Feels like I'm all the way back where I belong
Feels like I'm all the way back where I belong
