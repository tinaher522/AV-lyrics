<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="Love_On_The_Rocks">
Love on the rocks
Ain't no surprise
Just pour me a drink
And I'll tell you some lies
Got nothin' to lose
So you just sing the blues
All the time
Gave you my heart
Gave you my soul
You left me alone here
With nothing to hold
Yesterday's gone
Now all I want is a smile
First they say they want you
How they really need you
Suddenly you find you're out there
Walking in a storm
And when they know they have you
Then they really have you
Nothing you can do or say
You've got to leave, just get away
We all know the song
You need what you need
You can say what you want
Not much you can do
When the feeling is gone
May be blue skies above
But it's cold when your love's on the rocks
First, they say they want you
How they really need you
Suddenly you find you're out there
Walking in a storm
And when they know they have you
Then they really have you
Nothing you can do or say
You've got to leave, just get away
We all know the song
Love on the rocks
Ain't no surprise
Just pour me a drink
And I'll tell you my lies
Yesterday's gone
And now all I want is a smile
