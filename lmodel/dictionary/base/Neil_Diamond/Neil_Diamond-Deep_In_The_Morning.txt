Hey, deep in the morning

She gonna love me
Kisses are warmin'
Never want showin' she gonna want me

And I say Na na na.na na na na na na
Na na na.na na na na na na na na na
Deep in the morning I can see her
Long hair falling down her eyes
And my head keeps sayin' I need her
Sayin' I need her
Good that she's mine
Oh, good that she's mine now
Didn't she take me
Make me a right man
'Cause she wanna love me
She wanna love me
Didn't she wake me
Take me out of the night, yeah
'Cause she gonna want me
She gonna want me
And I say Na na na.na na na na na na
Na na na.na na na na na na na na na
Deep in the morning I can see her
Long hair falling down her eyes
And my head keeps sayin' I need her
Sayin' I need her Good that she's mine
Oh, good that she's mine now
Deep in the morning,
Kisses are warmin'
