<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="Wish_Everything_Was_Alright">
Words By: Neil Diamond, Doug Rhone, Hadley Hockensmith
The more you explain, the less I feel assured
The closer I came, the more you'd hide
And here's what I think, we better get in touch
Wish I could tell you everything was alright
Wish everything was alright
The bigger the thrill, the more we're gonna pay
You figure the bill, it's gonna bite
The higher we get, the more we're hanging on
Wish I could tell you everything was alright
Wish everything was alright
And I know, I know, I know I love you
We can make it what we want it to be
You know, you know, you know you love me
So ask yourself where does it lead?
The more we expect the less we're gonna find
Whatever we get is gonna go
And here's what I think we better stay in touch
Wish I could tell you everything was alright
Wish everything was alright
Wish I could tell you everything was alright, yeah
Wish everything was alright
