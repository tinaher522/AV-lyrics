<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="The_Long_Way_Home">
Had to go
Had to know all there was out there
Now I'm back
I know that, girl,
It's all right here.
Girl, I took the long way home,
It's true,
The long way home to you, yeah,
And I just wanna say
I'm home to stay.
Ran a lot
Don't know what I thought I would find
Town to town
All I found was you on my mind.
Girl, I took the long way home,
It's true,
The long way home to you, yeah,
And I just wanna say
I'm home to stay.
