<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="Only_You">
Only you
You and the night
And the right kind of music
And only you
There's only you
And only the moments
That we've spent together will ever do
And only me
Me like the fool with his head in the clouds
Could believe
But I believe dreams will come true
With only you
And so I dreamed
I'll wait for the moment
I'm praying and hoping
That what I dreamed will soon come true
I'll have you forever
And never be lonely again
Not only friends, but lovers too
With only you
Me, I was that fool on the hill
You know I will be waiting there still
Hoping you'd come back again
I heard your name
Echoing soft through the trees
I know it was calling to me
And nothing could keep me away
I only wanted to hold you
And only you
There's only you
And only me
Me like the fool with his head in the clouds
Could believe
But I believe dreams will come true
With only you
Me, I was that fool on the hill
You know I will be waiting there still
Hoping you'd come back again
I heard your name
Echoing soft through the trees
I know it was calling to me
And nothing could keep me away
I only wanted to hold you
And only you
You and the night
And the right kind of music
And only you
Hey, there's only you
Only you
Hey, it's only you
Only you
Hey, there's only you
Only you
Hey, it's only you
Only you
