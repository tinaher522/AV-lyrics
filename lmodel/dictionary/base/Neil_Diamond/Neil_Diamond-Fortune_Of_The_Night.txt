Fortune of the night,
callin' out my name and saying she'll be mine tonight,
fortune of the night.
Oh, my heart is tellin' me,
oh, I better put a move on.
If she got away,
then not a day would go by without some blue song.
All my life,
I've waited for just tonight
to say that I love her.
And all this time,
I've wanted to call her mine
and how her I love her.
Fortune of the night,
callin' out my name and saying
I will find her.
Fortune of the night,
is there any doubt I'll need to have her by my side,
fortune of the night?
Fortune of the night.
And oh, I'm really movin' now 'cause,
oh, I would feel like a fool, yeah,
if she got away.
They'd only say the rumors would truly be true, yeah,
that all this time
I waited to call you mine.
And you got to know it.
Fortune of the night,
callin' out my name and saying I will find her.
Fortune of the night,
isn't any doubt I'll need to have you by my side,
fortune of the night.
To want her,
to love her,
oh, I do.
And now's my time.
I've waited, but now's my time to show that I love her.
Fortune of the night,
callin' out to me and saying I was chosen.
Fortune of the night,
tellin' me that we'll be there
until the morning light,
fortune of the night.
ah ah ah ah ah
Fortune of the night,
I hear you call.
ah ah ah ah ah
Are you gonna keep an eye on me tonight?
ah ah ah ah ah Fortune of the night, I hear you call.
ah ah ah ah ah are you gonna sing your song with me sometime?
ah ah ah ah ah Fortune of the night, I hear you call.
ah ah ah ah ah are you gonna shine your light on me and make her mine?
