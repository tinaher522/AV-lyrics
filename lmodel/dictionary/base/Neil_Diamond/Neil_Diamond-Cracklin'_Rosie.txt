<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="Cracklin'_Rosie">
Cracklin' Rosie, get on board
We're gonna ride till there ain't no more to go
Taking it slow
Lord, don't you know
Have made me a time with a poor man's lady
Hitchin on a twilight train
Ain't nothing here that I care to take along
Maybe a song
To sing when I want
Don't need to say please to no man for a happy tune.
Oh, I love my Rosie child
You got the way to make me happy
You and me, we go in style
Cracklin Rose, you're a store bought woman
You make me sing like a guitar hummin'
So hang on to me, girl
Our song keeps runnin' on
Play it now
Play it now
Play it now, my baby
Cracklin Rosie, make me a smile
Girl if it lasts for an hour, that's all right
We got all night
To set the world right
Find us a dream that don't ask no questions, yeah
