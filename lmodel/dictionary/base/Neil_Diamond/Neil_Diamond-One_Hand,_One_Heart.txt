<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="One_Hand,_One_Heart">
Make of our hands, one hand
And make of our hearts, one heart
Make of our vows, one last vow
Only death will part us now
Make of our lives, one life
Day after day, one life
Now it begins, now we start
One hand, one heart
Even death won't part us now
</song>
