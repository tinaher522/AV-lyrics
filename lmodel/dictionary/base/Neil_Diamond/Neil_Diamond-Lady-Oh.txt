<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="Lady-Oh">
Lady-oh, Lady-oh, I walked the streets again last night. 
I saw you in the city light like a vision, Lady-oh.
Lady I, Lady I, I've been waitin' around such a long long time
believin' I could make you mine, just wanting you Lady-oh. 
But here I am and there you are, much too far to even hear me.
Hurts a lot, you know it does, it hurts a lot.
Oh, Lady-oh, am I gonna ever learn what I never learned before?
City lights, city lights burn so warm and they burn so bright,
but me, I walk the city night to forget you, Lady-oh. 
But here I am and there you are, much too far to even hear me.
Hurts a lot, you know it does, it hurts a lot. 
Oh, Lady-oh, am I gonna ever learn what I never learned before?
