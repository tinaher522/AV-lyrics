<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="You_Are_My_Love_At_Last">
I have searched the whole world
Looking for that one girl
That was in the past
And you are my love at last
You're my one desire
Set my soul on fire
Now a spell is cast
And you are my love at last
You are life to me
And my destiny
Things a mortal man wouldn't understand
I see paradise deep within your eyes
I am yours forever
I have hungered for you
Wanting to adore you
No more do I fast
For you are my love at last
I am yours forever
I have hungered for you
Wanting to adore you
No more do I fast
For you are my love at last
You are my love at last
You are my love at last
You are my love at last
You are my love at last
You are my love at last
