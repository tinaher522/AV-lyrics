<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="Brother_Love">
Hot august night
And the leaves hanging down
And the grass on the ground smelling sweet
Move up the road
To the outside of town
And the sound of that good gospel beat
Sits a ragged tent
Where there ain't no trees
And that gospel group
Telling you and me
It's Love, Brother Love, say
Brother Love's Traveling Salvation Show (halle, halle)
Pack up the babies
And grab the old ladies
And everyone goes
'Cause everyone knows
Brother Love's show
Room gets suddenly still
And when you'd almost bet
You could hear yourself sweat, he walks in
Eyes black as coal
And when he lifts his face
Every ear in the place is on him
Starting soft and slow
Like a small earthquake
And when he lets go
Half the valley shakes
It's Love, Brother Love, say
Brother Love's Traveling Salvation Show (halle, halle)
Pack up the babies
And grab the old ladies
And everyone goes
'Cause everyone knows
'Bout Brother Love's show

(hallelujah)
SPOKEN: Brothers! (halle hallelujah)
I say brothers! (hallelujah)
Now you got yourself 
Two good hands (halle hallelujah)
And when your brother is troubled
You got to reach out your one hand for him (hallelujah) 
'Cause that's what it's there for (halle hallelujah)
And when your heart is troubled
You gotta reach out your other hand (hallelujah)
Reach it out to the Man up there
'Cause that's what He's there for (halle hallelujah)
Take my hand in yours
Walk with me this day
In my heart I know
I will never stray
Halle, halle, halle, halle, halle, halle, halle halle
Love, Brother Love,
Say Brother Love's Traveling Salvation Show 
Pack up the babies
And grab the old ladies
And everyone goes
I say Love, Brother Love,
Say Brother Love's Traveling Salvation Show 
Pack up the babies
And grab the old ladies
And everyone goes
(repeat to fade)
