<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="Dancing_To_The_Party_Next_Door">
There I was
Sittin' at home with my magazine
Just kickin' back
Quietly drinking my cup of tea
But suddenly
I hear the sound of rock and roll
Comin' through my walls
Makes me lose control
And I'm dancin' to the party next door
Groovin' with the kids on the floor, yeah
Dancin' to the party next door
And I'm havin' a good time,
Oh yeah, uh huh, alright
I'm havin' a good time
Oh yeah, uh huh, alright
Look at me
I'm a reserved and a proper guy
But suddenly
Mister Reserved here is flyin' high
Hey, I believed
Some things were just not meant to be
Like carryin' on this way
But take a look at me
Hey
I'm dancin' to the party next door
Hey
I'm groovin' with the kids on the floor, yeah
Dancin' to the party next door
And I'm havin' a good time
Oh yeah, uh huh, alright
I'm havin' a good time
Oh yeah, uh huh, it's alright
And it's clear to me
I see the writing on the wall
Says how you gonna fly
If you're afraid to fall
So I'm dancin' to the party next door
Groovin' with the kids on the floor, yeah
Dancin' to the party next door
And we're havin' a good time
I'm dancin' to the party next door
Groovin' with the kids on the floor, yeah
Dancin' to the party next door
And we're havin' a good time
I'm dancin' to the party next door
Groovin' with the kids on the floor, yeah
Dancin' to the party next door
And we're havin' a good time
