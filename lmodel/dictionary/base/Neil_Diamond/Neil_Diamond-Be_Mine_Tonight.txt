<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="Be_Mine_Tonight">
I never needed to hear the truth
You never wanted to know
I never wanted to be unkind
But then something kept telling me go
There was something kept telling me go
We stayed together like birds in a cage
But then one of us had to get free
But who had the heart to say goodbye
Wasn't you, so it had to be me
Wasn't you, so it had to be me
You told me to go when I wanted to stay
Making me over in every way
Telling me just what to do with my life
But oh how I wish you could be mine
Oh how I wish you would
Be mine tonight
Be mine tonight
Tonight
Be mine tonight
We never knew it for what it was worth
It was worth more than we understood
We never got past the lies and the hurt
And it hurt even when it was good
Yes it hurt even when it was good
You told me to go when I wanted to stay
Making me over in every way
Telling me just what to do with my life
But oh how I wish you could be mine
Oh how I wish you could
Be mine tonight
Be mine tonight
Tonight
Be mine tonight
Tonight
Be mine tonight
Tonight
Be mine tonight
Tonight
Be mine tonight
Tonight
Be mine tonight
Tonight
Tonight
