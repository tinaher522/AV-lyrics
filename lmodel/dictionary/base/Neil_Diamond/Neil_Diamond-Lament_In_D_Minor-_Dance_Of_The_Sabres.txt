<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="Lament_In_D_Minor-_Dance_Of_The_Sabres">
Sabre dance
When death plays the game of chance
Dance sabre, dance
Oh, sweet romance
The flashing of sabres dance
Dance sabre dance
Dance, sabre dance
Come on now
Dance, sabre dance
Sabre dance
When death plays the game of chance
The flashing of sabres dance
For honor and sweet romance
Come dance, sabre dance
