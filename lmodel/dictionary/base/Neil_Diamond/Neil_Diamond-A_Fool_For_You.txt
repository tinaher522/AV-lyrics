<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="A_Fool_For_You">
I'm a fool for your love
And it scares me somehow
What I do for your love
And what I need from you now
It's all because of you
You've gone beyond all my pride
To where my dream world begins
To where the little man hides
I need you so bad
And you're so far inside me now
That I can't turn you away
Well, you're so far inside me now
That I hardly know
What to say or what to do
I'm a fool for you
I'm a fool for you
It's a wide open world
And it's easy to fall
In the eyes of the world
When you reach for it all
But it's because of you
You've overcome all my fears
You found your way down the road
To where I hide all my tears
And I need you so bad
And you're so far inside me now
That I can't turn you away
And you're so far inside me now
That I hardly know
What to say or what to do
Well you're so far inside me now
That I hardly know
What to say or what to do
And you're so far inside me now
That I hardly know
What to say or what to do
