<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="You_Make_It_Feel_Like_Christmas">
Look at us now,
Part of it all
In spite of it all,
We're still around
Lovers in love,
Just like we were
Being apart's a lonely sound
When people ask how we stay together
I say you never let me down
And you make it feel like Christmas
Even when things go wrong
I hear the sound of Christmas in your song
All year long
Yes, you know that I do
Look at the sun
Shining on me
Nowhere could be a better place
Lovers in love,
That's what we are
I reach for that star out there in space
'Cause you make it feel like Christmas
Even when things go wrong
I hear the sound of Christmas in your song
All year long
And you know that's it true
Sleepy we are,
But happy together
Sounds of forever
Greet the day
So wake up the kids,
Put on some tea
Light up the tree,
It's Christmas day
Yeah, you make it feel like Christmas
Even when things go wrong
I hear the sound of Christmas in your song
All year long
Yes you know that I do
All year long
Light up the tree,
It's Christmas time
