<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="You_Played_The_Field_I_Played_The_Fool">
You said farewell
And broke my heart in two
Without your love, what would I ever do?
You said you loved me,
But you were untrue
You played the field, I played the fool
I still recall the things you said to me
You said the love we shared
Was meant to be
But now you left me, and we're through
You played the field, I played the fool
I'm so all alone now
That you've left my side
You went out to roam, you broke my heart
You lied, you lied
Goodbye to all the love I ever knew
It hurts to see my lucky star turn blue
I gave you my heart, what did you do?
You played the field, I played the fool.
