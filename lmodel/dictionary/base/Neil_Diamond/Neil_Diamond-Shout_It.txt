<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="Shout_It">
Shout it,
Gonna stand up and shout it
Tell all the world about it
I love you, yes I do
Shout it
I'm gonna tell the whole world about it.
They're gonna know you're my girl
From now on, all I want
I never knew that it could be
You do a special thing to me
I know I just can't hide my glowing
So I shout it
When you're with me it's glad times
We'll never see those bad times
Shout it out
Shout it loud
I never knew that it could be
You do a special thing to me
I know I can't hide my glowing,
So I shout it
When you're with me, it's glad times
We'll never see those bad times
Shout it out
Shout it loud
