Songmaker 
You heartbreaker 
You figure 
Better stop it while you can 
You know you're just a worthless daydreamer 
But hey dreamer 
It's time to act like a man 
Song writin' 
It's just a little bit frightenin' 
Like playin' with lightening 
I'm not complainin' now you understand 
You get to sing and dance all day 
Like children play 
But it's time to act like a man 
Bein' a man means responsible 
You hear it wherever you go 
Nothing is ever impossible 
Something inside tells me so 
And I know 
What I know. 
Say lover 
Better discover 
Some other way to turn your head around again 
And really don't you wait now 
It's gettin' late now 
It's time to act like a man 
Bein' a man means responsible 
You hear it wherever you go 
Nothing is ever impossible 
Something inside tells me so 
And I know what I know 
Songmaker 
You heartbreaker 
You figure 
You better stop it while you can 
You know you're just a worthless daydreamer 
But hey dreamer, 
It's time to act like a man. 
You've got to act like a man. 
Why don't you grow up and act like a man?
