<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="All_I_Have_Is_Me">
Ev'ry one has someone
Ev'ry one but me
I'm alone, on my own
All I have is me
When I'm low and lonely, life is misery
No one's there, no one cares
All I have is me
Some people take for granted,
The one for whom they really care
But life is far from enchanted
When you got no one there
If I find my someone and she vows,
To be by my side all the time
All she'll have is me
