<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="Win_The_World">
Written by: Neil Diamond and Susan Longacre
I never noticed when you changed your hair
Just another of those moments, I was only half there
When you wore that red dress, that was kind'a up to here
I never noticed, you were wearing a tear
I was always trying to win the world
What on earth was I thinking of
One time too often, I didn't hold you enough
I was always trying to win the world
But somewhere I lost you, I never saw you
Only trying to win my love
It should have been easy, for all of those times
It would have been me there, if I knew the signs
When you wore that red dress, how could I know then
You'd wear it for me once, and never wear it again 
I was always trying to win the world
What on earth was I thinking of
One time too often, I didn't hold you enough
I was always trying to win the world
But somewhere I lost you, 'cause I never saw you
Only trying to win my love
Somewhere I lost you, 'cause I never saw you
Only trying to win my love
