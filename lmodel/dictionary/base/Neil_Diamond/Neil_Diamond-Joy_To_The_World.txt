<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="Joy_To_The_World">
Let every heart
Let every soul
Let every one
Come hear the sound
Joy to the world
The Lord is come
Let Earth receive her King
Let every heart prepare Him room
And heaven and nature sing
And heaven and nature sing
And heaven
And heaven and nature sing
Joy to the world
The Savior reigns
Let men their songs employ
While fields and floods
Rocks, hills, and plains
Repeat the sounding joy
Repeat the sounding joy
Repeat,
Repeat the sounding joy
And heaven and nature sing
And heaven and nature sing
And heaven
And heaven and nature sing
Joy to the world
The Lord has come
Let Earth receive her King
Let every heart prepare him room
And heaven and nature sing
And heaven and nature sing
And heaven
And heaven and nature sing
And heaven
And heaven and nature sing
Joy unto the world
Let nature sing
