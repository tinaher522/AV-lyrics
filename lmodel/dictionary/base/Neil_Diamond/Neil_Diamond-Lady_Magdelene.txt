<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="Lady_Magdelene">
The man on the right is a man undone
He'd give you his soul
If you asked him for some
A child in his way for he needs to believe
That love is a song for each man to sing
The man on the left is a prize un-won
A candle unlit and a song unsung
Believing that love is a dreamer's dream
The man on the left,
The me in between
Lady Magdelene,
I can hear your distant trumpet
Calling from the morning mountain
Singing to the passing river
Take me home,
Show me peaceful days
Before my youth has gone
The man in between waits between the two
Not hearing the lie and not seeing the true
Unknowing what is and denying what seems
And there he will sleep
The man in between
Lady Magdelene,
I can hear your distant trumpet
Calling from the morning mountain
Singing to the passing river
Take me home,
Show me peaceful days
Before my youth has gone
Lady Magdelene,
Make the sound of silent thunder
Calling from the lips of Abraham
Make a sound that we may wonder,
Where we are
Take us to your soul
For we have wandered far
The man on the right was a man undone
The man on the left like a prize unwon
And God only knows
What their time will bring
Or what will become
Of the man in between
