<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="I_(Who_Have_Nothing)">
I,
I who have nothing I,
I who have no one
Adore you and want you so
I'm just a no one
With nothing to give you darlin'
But, oh
I love you
He,
He buys you diamonds
Bright, sparkling diamonds
But, believe me, dear, when I say
That he can give you the world
But he'll never love the way
I love you
He can take you any place he wants
To fancy clubs and restaurants
But I can only watch you
With my nose pressed up against
The window pane
I love you I
I who have nothing I
I who have no one
Must watch you go dancing by
Wrapped in the arms
Of somebody else
When, darling, it's I
Who loves you
I love you
I love you
I who have nothing
