<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="Memphis_Flyer">
Take me home on the Memphis Flyer 
Take me home to a point down south 
Got to go just to keep from dying 
Come on, baby, 
You and me gonna play house 
You and me on the wings of freedom 
You and me leave it all behind 
I can't say where it's all been leadin' 
But come on, baby 
Before we go changin' our mind 
We can fly 
Like a bird on the wings of a song 
We get by 
We're alive but you know that it won't 
Be too long, be too long, be too long 
Come on, honey 
Time to be movin' on 
Now or never, baby 

Got to fly like a song of freedom 
Got to fly just to save my soul 
You get by on the song I'm singin' 
Come on, baby 
We're too young to be gettin' old 

We can fly 
Like a bird on the wings of a song 
We get by 
We're alive but we won't be too long 
We can fly, we can fly, 
We can fly, we can fly
