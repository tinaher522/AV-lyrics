<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="But_That_Was_Yesterday">
I thought this love of ours
Was here to stay
Your heart was true when love was new
But that was yesterday
Our love was warmer than a summer day
And ev'ry kiss told of our bliss
But that was yesterday
Yesterday's memories
Bring today's sorrows
Now that you're gone from me
We share no tomorrows
I still remember
Dear, the plans we made
You always said "Some day we'd wed,"
But that was yesterday
