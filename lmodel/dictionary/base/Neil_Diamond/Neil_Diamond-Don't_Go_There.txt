<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="Don't_Go_There">
She wants to take it just a little bit further now 
Don't let it happen, 
'Cause if you let her in, 
She's gonna take it away 
Makin' you pay. 
And what are you gonna say? 
You better beware 
And don't go there. 
Don't wanna let her play with what belongs to you 
'Cause if you let her play with you know what 
You know what she's gonna do 
She's gonna take it from you 
That's just what she's gonna do 
I don't know where 
And don't go there. 
The voice is sitting on my shoulder and telling me 
The night is warm now but it might be getting colder 
Better look out friend 
Before you finally decide which way to go 
I hope you stop and review 
The scenario and how it ends 
So just take care 
And don't go there. 
Alright... 
Don't say I didn't warn you my friend. 
If you think it'll last 
May be time to start thinking again. 
You're lookin' for love and you think that you'll find it soon 
You're looking to put it away in the bank and save it 
Follows you around like the odor of cheap perfume 
You're paying a price when your heart has been misbehavin' 
Don't go there 
Don't go there. 
You'll want to play it safe 
And make no promises 
If she understands the rules of the game but maybe work out fine 
But baby take your time and don't you be unkind 
But till that's clear 
Then don't go there. 
This thing is liable to take some funny turns 
The only thing -- a real concern to me 
Is having you protect yourself 
It's not like either one of you is flying blind 
But in the heat of things, 
You got to apply your mind to something else. 
No, life ain't fair 
Don't go there. 
Once you're in, you might not get out. 
He he he he 
You're looking for love in the back of a limousine 
You're looking for something that's missing inside to fill you. 
If you think you can run on the power of nicotine 
They got a new drug for your mood that'll surely thrill you. 
Don't go there 
Don't go there 
This ain't the Bible, and it ain't no moral tale 
If it's a lesson in survival, you can learn it 
If it's not too late 
But don't you wait 
Or hesitate 
The lesson's clear 
Please don't go there 
Don't go there 
Don't go there 
Don't go there.
