<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="White_Christmas">
The sun is shining
The grass is green
The orange and palm trees sway.
There's never seen such a day
In Beverly Hills L.A.
But it's December the 24th
And I am longing to be up North.
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know.
Where the tree tops glisten,
And children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow.
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write.
May your days be merry and bright.
And may all your Christmases be white.
Yes
I'm dreaming of that white Christmas
There's nothing like
That newly fallen snow
Treetops glisten,
And children all listen
Hear some sleigh bells in the snow.
You know it's so
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write.
May your days be merry and bright.
And may all your Christmases be
May every Christmas Day be
May all your Christmases
Be any color you like
Where the treetops glisten,
And children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow.
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write.
May your days be merry,
Merry and bright.
And may all your Christmases be
May all your Christmases be
May all your Christmases be white
