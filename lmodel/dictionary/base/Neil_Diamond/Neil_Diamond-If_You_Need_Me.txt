<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="If_You_Need_Me">
If you need me,
If you need me,
If you need me,
Darlin', I'll be there
Don't say a word
You'll be on your way
If you really want her
No I won't make you stay
But if she breaks your heart, now
And makes you feel so small
And you want
You want a true love then maybe this girl
And darling I'll be there
If you need me,
If you need me,
Any time at all dear I don't care
If you need me,
If you need me,
Darling I'll be there
You know I'll be lying
If you heard me say
Don't think about me love
It's better this way
It's gonna mean heartache
But I want you to know
My heart my heart is with you
Wherever you go
And darling you know I'll be there
If you need me,
If you need me,
Any time at all dear
I don't care
If you need me,
If you need me,
Darling I'll be there
