<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="Sunday_Sun">
Hey, Sunday Sun
Let's go walkin'
And we'll talk about some things
Kick my shoes off,
And we'll dream about some dreams
Got to get away when the world
Gets on me
Kids in the park
Don't take long before
I'm laughing along with them
Almost makes me think
Those times can come again
Gets me feelin' good and yet sad
At the same time
Sunday Sun, when you're round
Get to feelin' like I wanna smile
Weekday strings, tie me down
But this one day, baby, I can fly
I can fly
Time on my mind,
Make the most of it,
Just me and a Sunday Sun
Liable to forget that Monday ever comes
Gonna sit around
Watchin' bees chasin' honey
Sunday Sun, when you're 'round
Get to feelin' like I wanna smile
Weekday strings, tie me down
But this one day, baby, I can fly
I said I can fly
Hey Sunday Sun
Let's go walkin'
And we'll talk about some things
I kick my shoes off
And we'll dream about some dreams
Come on Sunday Sun,
We got some plans to make
We go walking...
