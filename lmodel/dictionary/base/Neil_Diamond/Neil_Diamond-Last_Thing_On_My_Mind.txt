<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="Last_Thing_On_My_Mind">
It's a lesson too late for the learning
Made of sand
Made of sand
In the wink of an eye my soul is turning
In your hand
In your hand
Are you going away?
With no word of farewell
Will there be not a trace left behind?
Well I could have loved you better
I didn't mean to be unkind
You know that was the last thing on my mind
You got reasons a plenty for going
This I know
This I know
For the weeds have been steadily growing
Please don't go
Please don't go
Are you going away?
With no word of farewell
Will there be not a trace left behind?
Well I could have loved you better
I didn't mean to be unkind
You know that was the last thing on my mind
