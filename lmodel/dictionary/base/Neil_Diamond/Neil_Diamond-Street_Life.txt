<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="Street_Life">
Hey, let me show you the street life
Hey, let me show you the finks,
The punks, the judge, the junkies
Stay close to me for a while
For a while, for a while
Say boy, you got to get street wise
Hey, little boy
You're a babe in arms
Stay out of harm's way
Wait right here with me for a while
For a while, for a while
Street life, hell in the city
You got to really watch out for that
Street life
Say, it ain't pretty
You got to know your way around
Or somehow you might get hurt
Get hurt, get hurt
Say, let me show you the night life
Say, let me show you the queens
The dudes, the class, the crudes
The folks that inhabit the night
Let me set it right
I'm gonna give you my warning
I'm gonna tell you the street's alive
The sound of jive
You've just arrived
Try it for size for a while, for a while
Street life, hell in the city
You got to really watch out for that
Street life
Say, it ain't pretty
You got to know your way around
Or somehow you might get hurt
Get hurt, get hurt
