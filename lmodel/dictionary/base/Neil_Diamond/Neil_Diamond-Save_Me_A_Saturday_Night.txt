<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="Save_Me_A_Saturday_Night">
How did I ever find you?
I've been waitin so long
But now your trouble's behind you
Time is hurrying on and all that I want
Is save me a Saturday night
Leave me some room at your table
Slip into your heart if I might
And stay just as long as I'm able
Baby, save me a Saturday night
I'll be someone you count on
Sure, it's hard to believe
But try just keep me around, I'm yours
I just want to be wherever you need me
Save me a Saturday night
Leave me some room at your table
I want to slip into your heart if I might
And stay just long as I'm able
Baby, save me a Saturday night
....
Save me a Saturday night
Leave me some room at your table
I want to slip in to your heart if I might
And stay there as long as I'm able
Baby, save me a Saturday night
Please... a Saturday night
Leave me some room at your table
I want to slip in to your heart if I might
And stay there as long as I'm able
Baby, save me a Saturday night
