<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="Winter_Wonderland">
Sleigh bells ring are you listening
In the lane snow is glistening
A beautiful sight
We're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland
Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song as we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland
In the meadow we can build a snowman
We'll pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say: Are you married?
We'll say: No man
But you can do the job
When you're in town
Later on we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid
The plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland
In the meadow
We can build a snowman
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun
With mister snowman
Until the other kids
Come knock him down
Later on we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid
The plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland
Walking in a winter wonderland
We'll be walking in a winter,
Winter wonderland
