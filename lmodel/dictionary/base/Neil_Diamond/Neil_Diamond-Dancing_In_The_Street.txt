<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="Dancing_In_The_Street">
(Are you ready to let it happen to you tonight?
Oh, yes ... do it, man ... here we go)
Calling out, 'round the world
Ready for a brand of beat
We're all here, time is right
Dancing in the street
There out in Chicago
New York city
All we need is music, sweet music
There'll be music everywhere
There'll be swingin' and swayin'
Records playing
Dancing in the street
Doesn't matter what you wear
Just as long as you are there
Come on, come on, now
Every guy grab a girl
Oh, everywhere around the world
Let it, Dancing in the street, Dancing
Dancing in the street, Dancing
Invitation, across the nation
Chance, folks want to meet
There'll be laughing, singing
Music swinging
Dancing in the street
Philedelphia, PA
Baltimore and DC, now
All we need is music, sweet music
There'll be music everywhere
There'll be swingin' and swayin'
Records playing
Dancing in the street
(all right girls, do it to me, here we go)
