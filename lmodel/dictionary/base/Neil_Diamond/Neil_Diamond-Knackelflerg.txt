<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="Knackelflerg">
Knackelflerg, that little word
It says what you meant to me
You've been awf'lly fine
Knackelflerg, I've never heard
A word that says more, for sure
And you're only mine
The silly way you hold my klarg
When I'm alone with only you
The way you touch this foolish heart
They way you do the things you try
Knackelflerg, that tiny word
It says what you mean to me
You've been awf'lly fine
Knackelflerg, I've never heard
A word that says more, for sure
And you're only mine
I've heard a thousand times before
That love is always playing games
But when I see that boop of yours
You set my eyebrows up in flames
(La la la la la)
Knackelflerg, that tiny word
It says what you mean to me
You've been awf'lly fine
Knackelflerg, I've never heard
A word that says more, for sure
And you're only mine
One more, fella's
Knackelflerg
