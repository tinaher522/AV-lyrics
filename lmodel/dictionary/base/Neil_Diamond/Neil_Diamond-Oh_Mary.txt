Oh Mary
Can you hear my song?
Does it make a mournful sound?
I sang it once when first I saw you
And I sing it to you now.
Oh Mary Oh Mary Oh Mary Oh Mary Oh Mary Oh
Talking bout love
Mary Oh Mary Oh
No, I don't want nothing in between
Mary Oh Mary Oh
Don't tie me to words that you don't mean
Mary Oh Mary Oh
I'm lookin' for something I never knew
Mary Oh Mary
Oh Mary
You know I'm lookin' for you
Oh Mary
You can doubt the world,
But don't ever doubt in me
I sang it once that I'd never leave you
And that's how its gonna be
Oh Mary Oh Mary Oh Mary Oh Mary Oh Mary Oh
Talkin' bout love
Mary Oh Mary Oh
No I don't want nothin' in between
Mary Oh Mary Oh
Don't tie me to words that you don't mean
Mary Oh Mary Oh
I'm looking for something I never knew
Mary Oh Mary
Oh Mary
You know I'm lookin' for you
Oh Mary
Let the chance go by
It may never come again
I've been around and I know what happens
And I'm too old to pretend
Oh Mary Oh Mary Oh
Mary Oh Mary Oh Mary Oh
Talkin' bout love
Mary Oh Mary Oh
No, I don't want nothing in between
Mary Oh Mary Oh
Don't tie me to words that you don't mean
Mary Oh Mary Oh
I'm lookin' for something I never knew
Mary Oh Mary
Oh Mary
You know I'm lookin' for you.
Oh Mary
Was it just a dream
That I dreamed the other night?
I saw you there
Standing right beside me
And we finally had it right
Oh Mary Oh Mary Oh
Mary Oh Mary Oh Mary Oh
Talkin' out love
Mary Oh Mary Oh
No, I don't want nothing in between
Mary Oh Mary
Don't tie me to words that you don't mean
Mary Oh Mary Oh
I'm looking for something I never knew
Mary Oh Mary Oh
Oh Mary you know I'm looking for you
Mary Oh Mary Oh Mary Oh Mary Oh
Mary Oh Mary Oh Mary Oh Mary Ohhhh
