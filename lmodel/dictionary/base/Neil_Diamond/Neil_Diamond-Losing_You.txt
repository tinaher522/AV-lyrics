<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="Losing_You">
Was a fool with my money
And I lost every dime
And the sun stopped shining
And it rained all the time
It did set me back some
But I made it through
But I'll never get over losing you
Do you know how much you mean to me?
Should've told you 'cause it's true
I'd get over losing anything
But I'll never get over losing you
When you're young
And there's time
To forget the past
You don't think you will
But you do
But I know that I don't have time enough
And I'll never get over losing you
I've been cold
I've been hungry
But not for awhile
I guess most of my dreams have come true
With it all here around me
No peace do I find
'Cause I'll never get over losing you
No, I'll never get over losing you
