<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="Mama_Don't_Know">
Mama don't know
What the preacher man know
But the preacher man know it all right
Papa don't know
What the preacher man do
When the preacher man come out tonight
"Heal Me"
She said, "Heal me, make me whole."
Here he comes
Well he's talking to the weak
Here he comes
Don't he touch you when he speaks?
Mama don't know
What the preacher man know
But the preacher man know it all right
Papa don't care
What the preacher man say
If the preacher man sayin' it right
"Heal Me"
She said, "Heal me, make me whole."
Here he comes
Well he's talking to the weak
Here he comes
Don't he touch you when he speaks?
Sweet Lord, we rejoice
And give ourselves to thee
True, Light, Glory and Grace
Make us see
"Heal Me, Heal Me, Heal Me, Heal Me,
Heal Me, Heal Me, Heal Me, Heal Me"
Here he comes
Well he's talking to the weak
Here he comes
Don't he touch you when he speaks?
Don't he touch you when he speaks?
Don't he touch you when he speaks?
