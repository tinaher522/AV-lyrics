<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="The_Pot_Smoker's_Song">
La la la
Pot, pot gimme some pot
Forget what you are,
You can be what you're not
High, high I wanna get high
You never give it up
If you give it a try...
La la la la
(teenage vocals)
La la la
Pot, pot gimme some pot
Forget what you are,
You can be what you're not
Do, do take a family cruise
You with your grass,
Mom and Dad with their booze
Ooo ooo
La la la la
(teenage vocals)
La la la
Pot, pot gimme some pot
Forget what you are
You can be what you're not
Tough, tough the world is so tough
And when it gets harder,
You can try stuff ,uh uh
(teenage vocals)
La la la
Pot, pot gimme some pot
Forget what you are,
You can be what you're not
Hip, hip you wanna be hip
You're no one at all
If you don't take a trip
Pot pot gimme some pot
Forget what you are,
You can be what you're not
Hip, hip you wanna be hip
You're no one at all
If you don't take a trip
