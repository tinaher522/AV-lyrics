<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="In_Ensenada">
In Ensenada
We were running
from the things that we knew best
We only took the good and left the rest
In Ensenada
Out on the border
And we knew
it was the last chance we would have
So we took the chance
and tried for one more laugh
In Ensenada
"Hold me"
She said, "Need Me"
She said, "Love me"
"And make it last until tomorrow"
Darling
You need me
The world is moving much to fast
Let's slow down and make it last
Like the first time
'Cause the first time
Never really left my mind
Came looking for the things we used to find
In Ensenada
Come looking for the things we used to find
In Ensenada
"Hold me"
She said, "Need Me"
She said, "Love me"
She said "Make it last until tomorrow"
Darling
You need me
The world is moving much to fast
Let's slow down
Come on and
She said, "Hold Me"
She said, "Need Me"
She said, "Love me"
"And make it last until tomorrow"
Darling
Believe me
Love me
We'll make it last until tomorrow
Darling
Believe me
She said, "Love me"
"Make it last until tomorrow"
Hold me and need me
She said, "Love me"
"Just make it last until tomorrow"
