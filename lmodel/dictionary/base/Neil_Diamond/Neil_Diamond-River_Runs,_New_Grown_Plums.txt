<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="River_Runs,_New_Grown_Plums">
She got to want, yeah,
Ev'rything I can't give her
But all that she wants, yeah,
Is knowin' that I'm there with her
River runs on down
Nothin'll keep it from where it's bound
New grown plums are blue
Honey it's natural
I love you
La la la la la la la....
Look at her now, yeah
Barefoot and full o' sassy
When she's around, yeah
I don't know and don't ya ask me
River runs on down
Nothin'll keep it from where it's bound
New grown plums are blue
Honey it's natural
I love you
La la la la la la la....
River runs on down
Nothin'll keep it from where it's bound
New grown plums are blue
Honey it's natural
I love you
