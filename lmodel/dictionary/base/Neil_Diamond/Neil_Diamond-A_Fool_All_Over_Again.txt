<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="A_Fool_All_Over_Again">
You left me once
For someone new dear
Then he left you , dear
And to ease your pain
I took you back
Now I discover you've found another
And I'm a fool all over again
You came back cryin'
Said you were wrong
But you were lyin' all along
My friends all said
That you'd forsake me
And that you'd make me
Part of your game
But I said
No, she she'll stop her messin'
She's learned her lesson
Now I'm a fool all over again
