<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="Right_By_You">
Right by you
Right by you
Want to do right by you
All night long
Right by you
Right by you
Want to be right by you
All night long
Why don't you tell me
I need to hear you say it
Come on and tell me
Just wanna hear it told
Don't I do right by you
Baby, don't I do right by you
All night long
Come on and say it
I love to hear you whisper
Just say you love me
I got to hear it told
Don't I do right by you
Baby, don't I do right by you
All night long
Don't I do right by you
Baby, don't I do right by you
All night long
Right by you
Right by you
Want to be right by you
All night long
Right by you
Right by you
Want to be right
Right by you
Right by you
Want to do
Right by you
