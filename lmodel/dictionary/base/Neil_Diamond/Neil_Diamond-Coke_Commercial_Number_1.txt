<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="Coke_Commercial_Number_1">
People are lookin'
For what they ain't got
Runnin' and pushin'
For I don't know what
But I'm gonna stake out
My own piece of shade
Count all the money
I ain't ever made
No No No
I ain't got a single plan
Wind in my face
And a Coke in my hand
No No No
Happy right where I am
Yeah, I got a Coke in my hand...
