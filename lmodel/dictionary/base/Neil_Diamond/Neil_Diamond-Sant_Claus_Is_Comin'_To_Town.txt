<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="Sant_Claus_Is_Comin'_To_Town">
You better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
Hey, I'm telling you why
Say it
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list
Checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Say it now
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're awake, yes, he does
He knows when you've been bad or good
So you better be good, you better be good
You better be good
You better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
Say, I'm telling you why
Come on now
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Santa Claus is comin' to town, oh yeah
Hey, boys and girls
It's Christmas time
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're awake, yes, he does
He knows when you've been bad or good
So you better be good, you better be good
You better be good for goodness sake
Little tin horns, little toy drums
Got rooty-toot-toots
And some rummy-tum-tums 'cause
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Santa Claus is comin' to town, look out
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Santa Claus is comin' to town
(Here he comes kids)
Santa Claus is comin' to town
(Oh, yes, can't stop the man no how)
Santa Claus is comin' to town
(He remembers every little thing you did all year)
Santa Claus is comin' to town
(All those kind unspoken words)
Santa Claus is comin' to town
(Keep up the good work guys)
Santa Claus is comin' to town
(Yep, pretty soon now)
