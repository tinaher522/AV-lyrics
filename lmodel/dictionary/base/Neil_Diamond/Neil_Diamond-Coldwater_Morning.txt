<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="Coldwater_Morning">
One, knowing I'm one, hearing of two
And like a child believing dreams
Always a dream to take you home
Day, after the day, there comes the night
There comes the knowing when you laugh
If you should laugh,
The night alone will hear
And the night don't care
Coldwater morning
Take off your nighttime shoes
Coldwater morning
I've been waiting so long for you
One, knowing I'm one, hearing of two
Hearing of things that I once had
That you once had
And when the night would come
We'd sleep like one
Coldwater morning
Take off your nighttime shoes
Coldwater morning
I've been waiting so long for you
I've been waiting so long for you....
