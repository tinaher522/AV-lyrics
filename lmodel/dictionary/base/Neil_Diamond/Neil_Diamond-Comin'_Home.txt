<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="Comin'_Home">
Operator, please
Just get her on the phone
She's got to know
I'm comin' home
For I've been gone
For a long, long time
But it really doesn't matter
When she's there on the line
Been on the road for a hundred days
And there's nothin' gonna stop me
'Cause I'm there on my way
And I'm comin' home, comin' home
I don't sleep good when I sleep alone
Goin' back, I'm knowin' that
You can't make love on the telephone
And I'm comin' home
Lost in time, almost lost my mind
But it really didn't matter
'Cause I knew all the time
I was headed back to my very own bed
And there was never a look behind
And I only looked ahead
'Cause I'm comin' home,
I'm comin' home
I don't sleep good when I sleep alone
Goin' back, I'm knowin' that
You can't make love on the telephone
And I'm comin' home
I'll make it through all right
Just knowin' that you're there
Baby, I concede, you're all I need
It's more than I can bare
I'm comin' home, comin' home
I don't sleep good when I sleep alone
I'm headin' back, I'm knowin' that
You can't make love on the telephone
And I'm comin' home,
Comin' home
I don't sleep good when I sleep alone
I'm headin' back, I'm knowin' that
You can't make love on the telephone
And I'm comin' home
