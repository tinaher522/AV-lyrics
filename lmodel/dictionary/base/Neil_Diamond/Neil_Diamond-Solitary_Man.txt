<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="Solitary_Man">
Melinda was mine
'Til the time that I found her
Holdin' Jim
And lovin' him
Then Sue came along
Loved me strong, that's what I thought
Me and Sue
That died, too
Don't know that I will
But until I can find me
A girl who'll stay
And won't play games behind me
Then I'll be what I am
A solitary man
Solitary man
I've had it to here
Bein' where love's a small word
Part-time thing
Paper ring
I know it's been done
Havin' one girl who loves you
Right or wrong
Weak or strong
Don't know that I will
But until I can find me
A girl who'll stay
And won't play games behind me
I'll be what I am
A solitary man
Solitary man
Don't know that I will
But until I can find me
A girl who'll stay
And won't play games behind me
Then I'll be what I am
A solitary man
Solitary man
Solitary man
Solitary man
