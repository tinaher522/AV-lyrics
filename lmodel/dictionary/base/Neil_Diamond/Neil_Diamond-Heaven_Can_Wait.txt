<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="Heaven_Can_Wait">
Heaven can wait for a while
'Cause I've got some things left to do
And I'm going home to a place
I've been gone from too long
Without being with you
Heaven can wait for a while
I've got some things left to see
Take me along to a place
I've been gone from too long
Without being with you
And heaven can wait till I do
Heaven can wait for a while
I've got some things left to say
And I'm going home to a place
I've been gone from too long
Without being with you
Heaven can wait for a while
'Cause I've got some things left to do
And I'm going home to a place
I've been gone from too long
Without being with you
And heaven can wait till I do
And heaven can wait till I do
You do one Richie....
