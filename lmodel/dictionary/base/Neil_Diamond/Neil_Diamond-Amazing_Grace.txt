<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="Amazing_Grace">
Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now am found
Was blind but now I see
The Lord has promised good to me
His word my hope secures
He will my shield and fortress be
As long as life endures
When we've been here ten thousand years
Bright shining as the sun
We've no less days to sing God's praise
Than when we've first begun
The story of 'Amazing Grace'
It was written over 200 years ago
By a sailor whose life was spared
Through the grace of God
On a ship on a stormy sea
Where he survived while the seaman
Who took his watch perished
Inspiring these words
Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now am found
Was blind but now I see
