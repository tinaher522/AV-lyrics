<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="Both_Sides_Now">
Rows and flows of angel hair 
Ice cream castles in the air 
Feather canyons everywhere 
I've looked at clouds that way 
But now they only block the sun 
They rain they snow on everyone 
So many things I would have done 
But clouds got in my way 
I've looked at clouds 
From both sides now 
From up and down, and still somehow 
It's cloud's illusions I recall 
I really don't know clouds at all 
Moons and Junes and Ferris wheels 
The dizzy dancin' way you feel 
As every fairy tale comes real 
I've looked at love that way 
But now it's just another show 
Leave 'em laughing when you go 
And if you care, don't let them know 
Don't give yourself away 
I've looked at love 
From both sides now 
From win and loose, and still somehow 
It's love's illusions I recall 
I really don't know love at all 
Tears and fears and feeling proud 
To say "I love you" right out loud 
Dreams and schemes and circus crowds
I've looked at life that way 
But now old friends 
They're acting strange
Shake their heads 
And say I've changed 
Well something's lost 
But something's gained 
In living every day 
I've looked at life from both sides now 
From give and take and still somehow 
It's life's illusions I recall 
I really don't know life at all
