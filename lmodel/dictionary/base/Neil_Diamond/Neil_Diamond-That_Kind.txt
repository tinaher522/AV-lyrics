<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="That_Kind">
She was only seventeen
And was every young boy's dream
The blue eyed beauty queen of the day
Broke some hearts, including mine
But everyone knew, she was just that kind
Seems like all her dreams were spent
On the boys that came and went
But the promises were all but left behind
She was good, and she was mine
But everyone knew, she was just that kind
Hey, they said
They're gonna take you her to Hollywood
Gonna make her like a movie star
Maybe put her in a picture show
Took her chance, she paid her dime
And maybe I loved her, 'cause she was that kind
She was gone by twenty one
When most lives had just begun
There was so much left undone along the way
She took her chance, she paid her dime
Oh, you gotta be strong, to be that kind
Hey, they said
We gonna take you out to Hollywood
We gonna make you like a movie star
We gonna put you in a picture show
Wasted life, a waste of time
But I couldn't have loved her if she wasn't that kind
No, I couldn't have loved her if she wasn't that kind
