<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="In_Better_Days">
How do I just forget that you were a part of me?
How do I leave behind everything we knew?
Looking inside of myself, where my heart would be
And all I see is you there too
Two of us goin' around in a state of denial, girl
Neither believin' the way it all came down
Didn't count much lost in paying the cost for a while, girl
Then this old world stopped spinning 'round
In better days we had it all
In better days when love came easy
We had it all but I never knew
How much there was when I had you
In better days, in better days
I remember a time there wasn't a dime between us two
We lived in a little old place on the side of a hill
Gave it our best in love, did the rest for me and you
Too young to lose, too hot to chill
In better days we had it all
In better days when love came easy
We had it all but I never knew
How much I lost when I lost you
In better days, in better days
Why do we promise forever and never stay that long?
Why do we swear to care until we die?
And what does it mean when two lovers sing loving songs
Then move along and not know why
In better days we had it all
In better days when love was easy
We had it all but I never knew
How much there was between me and you
In better days, back in better days
In better days, way back in better days, yeah
