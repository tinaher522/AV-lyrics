<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="No_Words">
No words could say how much I love you
No words could be as true
I've looked through books and read through dictionaries
But I found no words for you
No words, no words, no words
Oh no, oh no
No words can define what I'm feeling
When I feel close to you
No words can bring that magic kind of healing
Just as much as your touch can do
No words, no words, no words
Oh no, oh no
Well I'll admit there may be one or two
That danced around my head
But words that talk about me and you
Are better felt than said there are no
Words that can tell our story
They just get in the way
It's all about the feelings that you're feeling
Not about the words that you say
No words, no words, no words
Oh no, oh no
Well I'll admit there may be one or two
Been swimmin' round in my head
But what they say about me and you
Is better felt than said there are no
Words that can solve the mystery
Or explain God's eternal plan
We only know enough to ask the questions
Not enough to understand
No words, no words, no words
Oh no, oh no
No words, no words, no words
Oh no, oh no
