<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="Handle_With_Care">
Tell me that we'll never be apart
Say that you'll always be there
And promise if you take my heart
Oh darlin',
Handle with care
You know I love you only
There are none who compare
So hold me when I am lonely
And always
Handle with care
I've heard stories of lovers apart
Spending their nights all alone
If you want me, take care of my heart....
Remember it's the only one I own
Give me all your kisses
Your love I don't want to share
We may end up Mr. and Mrs.
If only you,
Handle with care
