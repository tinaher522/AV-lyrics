<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="Red,_Red_Wine">
Red, red wine
Go to my head
Make me forget that I
Still need her so
Red, red wine
It's up to you
All I can do, I've done
But memories won't go
No, memories won't go
I'd have sworn
That with time
Thoughts of you
Would leave my head
I was wrong
And I find
Just one thing
Makes me forget
Red, red wine
Stay close to me
Don't let me be alone
It's tearing apart
My blue, blue heart
