Sleigh Bells Ringing
Just hear those sleigh bells
Ringing and jing ting tingaling too
Come on its lovely weather for
A sleigh ride together with you
Outside the Snow is falling and
Friends are calling yoo hoo...
Come on its lovely weather for
A sleigh ride together with you
Giddy Up, Giddy Up,
Giddy Up, Let's Go!
Just  look at the show,
Were riding in a wonderland of snow
Giddy Up, Giddy Up, Giddy Up
Its Grand, just holdin' your hand
Were riding along with the song
Of a wintery wonder land.
Our cheeks are nice and rosy
And comfy cozy are we, 
Were snuggled
Up together like birds of
A feather would be
Lets take that road before us 
And sing a chorus or two, 
Come on its 
Lovely weather for a sleigh
Ride together with you
There's a birthday party at the home of 
Farmer grey
It'll be the perfect ending of a perfect day
We'll be singing the song we love to sing without a single stop
By the fireplace while we watch the 
Chesnuts pop.
There's a happy feeling nothing in the 
World can buy, 
When they pass around the 
Coffee and the pumpkin pie
It'll be like a picture print, by Currier and Ives
These wonderful things are the things we remember
Through our lives!
Just hear those sleigh bells
Ringing and jing ting tingaling too
Come on its lovely weather for
A sleigh ride together with you
Come on its lovely weather for
A sleigh ride together with you
Oh yeah its lovely weather for
A sleigh ride 
With you
With you
With you
Me and you
