<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="Cherry,_Cherry">
Baby loves me yes, yes she does
Oh, the girls out of sight, yeah
Says she loves me yes, yes she does
Mmm, gonna show me tonight, yeah
Hey, she got the way to move me, Cherry
(She got the way to groove me)
(She got the way to move me)
Cherry, baby
(She got the way to groove me)
Alright
Tell your mama, girl I can't stay long
We got things we gotta catch up on
Mmm, I know you know what I'm sayin'
Can't stand still while the music is playin'
Hey
Alright
Ain't got no right no, no you don't
Ahh, to be so exciting
Won't need bright lights no, no we won't
Mmm, gonna make our own lighting
Hey, she got the way to move me Cherry
(She got the way to groove me) Cherry, baby
(She got the way to move me) Alright
(She got the way to groove me)
No, won't tell a soul where we gone to
Girl, we do whatever we want to
Ahh, I love the way that you do me
Cherry babe, you really get to me
Hey, she got the way to move me, Cherry
(She got the way to groove me) Cherry baby
(She got the way to move me) Alright
(She got the way to groove me) Cherry
(She got the way to move me)
(She got the way to groove me) Cherry, baby
(She got the way to move me)
