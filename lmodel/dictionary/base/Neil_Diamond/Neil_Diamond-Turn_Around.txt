<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="Turn_Around">
Turn around,
Where do you think you're going
We've been through this door so many times
Just turn around,
We've got to keep it going like we did before
In better times
Turn around,
Look at me
Can't you see, I'll be there for you
If ever you should need me
You can run away,
But you can never hide
There'll come a day
You gonna have to face yourself
You'll wait and say,
It wasn't worth goodbye
Turn around,
Look at me
I'm the guy who loves you
And when you get tired of running around
Turn around,
Don't turn away, babe
Turn around, I want you to stay
You and me,
We still belong together
No one ever said we'd have an easy ride
When you love someone,
You got to talk it over
When you love someone,
You just don't let it die
Turn around,
Look at me
I just want to tell you
What you're looking for
You've already found
Turn around,
Don't turn away, babe
Turn around, I want you to stay
Turn around,
Don't turn away, babe
Just turn around, I want you to stay
Turn around,
Don't turn away, babe
Just turn around, I want you to stay
Turn around,
Don't turn away, babe
