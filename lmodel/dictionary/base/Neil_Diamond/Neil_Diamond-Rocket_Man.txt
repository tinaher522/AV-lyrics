<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="Rocket_Man">
She packed my bags last night, preflight
Was zero hour, nine a.m.
And I'm gonna be high
High as a kite by then
I miss the earth so much
I miss my lady
It's lonely out in space
On such a time, time
Such a timeless flight
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
Till touchdown brings me round again
To find I'm not the man
They think I am at home
Oh no, oh no, oh no
I'm a rocket man
Rocket man.....
Mars ain't the kind of place
You want to raise your kids
In fact, it's cold as hell
And there's no one there
That can raise them, if you did
And all the science I don't understand
It's just my job five days a week
I'm a rocket man
Oh, oh yeah
Just a rocket man
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
Till touchdown brings me around
To find I'm not the man
They think I am at home
Oh no, oh no, oh no
I'm a rocket man
Rocket man...
Rocket man..
