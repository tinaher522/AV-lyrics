<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="Childsong">
Weeping sky
We bring the sun
To make you glad
And fill you with the day
Quiet tree
We have the wind
To make you dance
And fill you with our play
And you shall be glad
And you shall dance
And you shall come
To hear our song
And learn its tune
Before it fades away....
