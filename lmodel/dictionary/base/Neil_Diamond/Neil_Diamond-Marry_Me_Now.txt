<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="Marry_Me_Now">
We don't believe in breaking up
We do believe in making up
That's all we really have to know
To make it so, it's official
Yesterday is here and gone
Tomorrow's where we both belong
Today's the day to make that change
And rearrange your initials
Marry me now
Say that "I do"
Don't wait around
You know I'm gonna be true
I'll give you my life
It's all that I've got
I love you
Believe it or not
Got so much celebrate
So why do we even hesitate
We've got the time, let's make the date
'Cause ain't life great together
Married's not an easy thing
But look at all the joy it brings
And you and me can't be afraid
'Cause each day's made to treasure
Marry me now
Say that "I do"
Don't wait around
You know I'm gonna be true
I'll give you my life
It's all that I've got
I love you
Believe it or not
Marry me now
Tell me "I do"
Don't wait around
You know I'm gonna be true
I'll give you my life
It's all that I got
I love you
Believe it or not
Marry me now
Tell me "I do"
Don't wait around
I'm gonna be true
I'll give you my life
It's all that I got
I love you
Marry me now
Marry me now
Marry me now
Marry me now
Marry me now
Tell me "I do"
Don't wait around
Gonna be true
Give you my life
Oh baby, I'll give it all to you
Mm mm mm
