<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="Red_Rubber_Ball">
I should have known
You'd bid me farewell
There's a lesson
To be learned from this
And I learned it very well
And now I know
You're not the only starfish in the sea
If I never hear your name again,
It's all the same to me
And I think it's gonna be all right
Yeah, the worst is over now
The mornin' sun is shinin'
Like a red rubber ball
You never cared for secrets I'd confide
For you I'm just an ornament
Somethin' for your pride
Always runnin', never carin'
That's the life you live
Stolen minutes of your time
Were all you had to give
And I think it's gonna be all right
Yeah, the worst is over now
The mornin' sun is shinin'
Like a red rubber ball
The story's in the past
With nothin' to recall
I've got my life to live
And I don't need you at all
The roller coaster ride we took
Is nearly at an end
I bought my ticket with my tears
And that's all I'm gonna spend
And I think it's gonna be all right
Yeah, the worst is over now
The mornin' sun is shinin'
Like a red rubber ball
Whoa, oh,
Oh I think it's gonna be all right
Yeah, the worst is over now
The mornin' sun is shinin'
Like a red rubber ball
