<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="You'll_Forget">
Loved her so
Then one day
She said she loved someone else instead
I'm goin' out of my head
'Cause over and over
I just hear the last words she said:
You'll forget
You'll forget that you loved me
And you'll stop thinkin' of me
You'll forget what you feel right now
But how?
There she stood,
The hands that once set me burning,
They were as cold as clay
And as she looked away
She said in the strangest voice the words
I never thought she'd say:
You'll forget,
You'll forget that you loved me
And you'll stop thinkin' of me
You'll forget what you feel right now
But how?
You know when you needed me
I was right there by your side.
But now you don't need me no more,
it's a fast goodbye, don't you cry
You'll forget,
You'll forget that you loved me
And you'll stop thinkin' of me
You'll forget
What you feel right now, but how?
You'll forget
You'll forget that you loved me
And you'll stop thinkin' of me
You'll forget what you feel right now
But how?
