<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="(Ooo)_Do_I_Wanna_Be_Yours">
I had a dream we were out on a meadow
Just you and me lyin' out in the sun
I knew that somebody would soon come to get you
Was hopin' that maybe I could be the one
Baby, ooo, do I wanna be
Ooo, do I wanna be yours
Knew that I wanna be
Like I never knew it before
And now everywhere I go
I go havin' you on my mind
And all I wanna know
Is ooo, do you wanna be mine
Because
Ooo, do I wanna be yours
For sure
Ooo, do I wanna be yours
I dreamed you were waitin' somewhere on the station
We're hopin' that maybe the right train would come
I heard myself startin' the conversation
And sayin' your waitin' was finally done
Told you, ooo, do I wanna be
Ooo, do I wanna be yours
Knew that I wanna be
Like I never knew it before
And now everywhere I go
I go havin' you on my mind
Now all I wanna know
Is ooo, do you wanna be mine
Because
Ooo, do I wanna be yours
For sure
Ooo, do I wanna be yours
I dreamed you were sittin' up there at your window
And lookin' at me with a strange kind of smile
I knew that you'd take me where I'd never been to
Was hopin' you'd ask me to stay for a while
Sayin', ooo, do I wanna be
Ooo, do I wanna be yours
Knew that I wanna be
Like I never knew it before
And now everywhere I go
I go havin' you on my mind
Now all I wanna know
Is ooo, do you wanna be mine
Because
Ooo, do I wanna be yours
For sure
Ooo, do I wanna be yours
Of course
Ooo, do I wanna be yours
