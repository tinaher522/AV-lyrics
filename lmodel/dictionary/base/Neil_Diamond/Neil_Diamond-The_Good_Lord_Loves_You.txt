<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="The_Good_Lord_Loves_You">
I'm singing this song for the men in your prisons and jails
The junkies and juicers and every good man that fails
And for every outlaw who's got no place left to go
The good Lord loves you
The good Lord loves you
The good Lord, he loves you so
And I'm singing this song for the leaders of every land
For every political and every military man
And for every mother and child in their kingdoms below
The good Lord loves you
The good Lord loves you
The good Lord, he loves you so
Ain't it sad that we're doing so bad
I'm singing this song with the feeling that's deep in my heart
And I wish I could tear down the walls that keep us apart
I wish I could tear down the walls so the feelings can grow
The good Lord loves you
The good Lord loves you
The good Lord, he loves you so
The good Lord loves you
The good Lord loves you
The good Lord loves you
The good Lord loves you
The good Lord, he loves you so
Ain't it sad that we're doing so bad
