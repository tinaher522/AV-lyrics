<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="It_Should_Have_Been_Me">
I think of you now and then
'Cause I remember when
Love was new and you were mine
My love
So why should we pretend
We were lovers but now we're friends
Don't want to say good-bye to you again
My love
It should have been me
That's holding you instead of someone else
I needed you but never let it show
It should have been me
That's loving you
Through all the lonely nights
I knew that I should have never let you go
My love
What we once had is gone
No tears, no right, no wrong
We could never be the same again
My love
The more we see the less we know
You still believe our love could grow
Don't want to say good-bye to you again
My love
It should have been me
That's holding you instead of someone else
I needed you but never let it show
It should have been me
That's loving you
Through all the lonely nights
I knew that I should have never let you go
My love
How will I survive
With another broken heart
On my own again
Just a lonely man
Looking for a place to start
It should have been me
That's holding you instead of someone else
I needed you but never let it show
It should have been me
That's loving you
Through all the lonely nights
I knew that I should have never let you go
My love
My love
