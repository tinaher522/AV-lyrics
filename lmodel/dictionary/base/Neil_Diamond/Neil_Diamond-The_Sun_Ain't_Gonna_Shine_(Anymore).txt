<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="The_Sun_Ain't_Gonna_Shine_(Anymore)">
Loneliness, well, it's the clothes you wear
It's a deep shade of blue, and it's always there
The sun ain't gonna shine anymore
The moon ain't gonna rise in the skies
Tears are always clouding your eyes
When you're without love
Emptiness, it's the place you're in
With no more to lose, and no more to win
The sun ain't gonna shine anymore
The moon ain't gonna rise in the skies
Tears are always clouding your eyes
When you're without love
Lonely, without you baby
Oh, I need you, I can't go on
The sun ain't gonna shine anymore
The moon ain't gonna rise in the skies
Tears are always clouding your eyes
When you're without love
