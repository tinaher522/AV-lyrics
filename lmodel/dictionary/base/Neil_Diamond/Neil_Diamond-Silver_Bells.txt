<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="Silver_Bells">
City sidewalks, busy sidewalks
Dressed in holiday style
In the air
There's a feeling of Christmas
Children laughing
People passing
Meeting smile after smile
And on ev'ry street corner you'll hear
Silver bells, silver bells
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling, hear them sing
Soon it will be Christmas day
[Spoken:]
Yes, I remember
The silver bells of my youth.
From the streets of Brooklyn
They rang up through my window,
And made me smile
Strings of street lights
Even stop lights
Blink a bright red and green
As the mallers rush home
With their treasures
Hear the snow crunch
See the kids bunch
This is Santa's big scene
And above all this bustle
You'll hear Silver bells, silver bells
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling, hear them sing
Soon it will be Christmas day
Soon it will be Christmas day
