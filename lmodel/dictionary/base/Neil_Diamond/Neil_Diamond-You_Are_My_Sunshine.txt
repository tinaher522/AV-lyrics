<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="You_Are_My_Sunshine">
The other night dear, as I lay sleeping
And I dreamed I held you in my arms
When I woke dear, I was mistaken
So I hung my head down and cried
You are my sunshine
My only sunshine
You make me happy
When skies are gray
You'll never know dear
Just how much I love you
Oh, please don't take
My sunshine away...
