Seongah and Jimmy
Seongah and Jimmy
They found each other
Downtown in Brooklyn
She's from Korea
He's from Long Island
They found each other
And they discovered love
Seongah and Jimmy
Seongah and Jimmy
Both have a sister
Both have a brother
She learns her English
He learns Korean
They learn that love is
Spoken in many ways
Seongah, how close can two lovers be?
Each day's a promise I'll never let you go
Seongah, how long must two lovers dream?
My head is reeling, feelings I've never known
Work in the city
Go there together
They take the subway
All kinds of weather
Friends in her office
Know her as Sarah
Seongah and Jimmy
Work for a better day
Seongah and Jimmy
Seongah and Jimmy
Live near each other
Out there in Green Point
Move in together
Promise forever
She cooks Korean
He likes Korean too
Seongah, don't be impatient with me
With you beside me, nowhere that I can't go
Seongah, dream how you want love to be
And I'll make a promise I'll try to make it so
She wants her Masters
He helps her study
He has a toothache
She finds a dentist
He says, "I love you."
She knows he means it
She says, "Saranghae."
He knows she means it too
I hear music in the air
People dancing in the street
Loves in blossom everywhere
Even strangers start to greet
Love happens in Brooklyn
I live there long ago and nothing's changed
Brought flowers, she took them
They laughed together in the pouring rain
De de de de de de de de de de de
Oh yeah
Seongah and Jimmy
Seongah and Jimmy
Soon they get married
In came their families
Her's from Korea
His from Long Island
They stayed together
And made a joyful day
Seongah and Jimmy
They had so much to say
Seongah and Jimmy
They found a better way
