<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="Longfellow_Serenade">
Longfellow serenade
such were the plans I'd made
For she was a lady and I was a dreamer with only words to trade.
You know that I was born for a night like this
Warmed by a stolen kiss
for I was lonely
and she was lonely.
Ride
come on baby
ride
let me make your drems come true
I'll sing my song
let me sing my song
let me make it warm for you.
I'll weave his web of rhyme upon the summer night
We'll leave this worldly time on his winged flight.
Then come and as we lay beside this sleepy glade
There I will sing to you my Long fellow .Serenade.
Longfellow serenade
such were the plans I made
But she was a lady as deep as the river
And through the night we stayed.
And in my way I loved her as none before
Loved her with words and more.
For she was lonely and I was lonely.
Ride
come on baby
ride
Iet me make your dreams come tru
