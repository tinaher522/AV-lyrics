<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="Melody_Road">
Melody Road, I'm on with you
All the way to the end
I know every song you lead me to
It's gonna be my friend
Melody Road, I play all night
Take my guitar and strum
Find me some words that feel just right
The music's gonna come from Melody Road
Melody from the heart
Melody from the start
Telling things will be okay
I'm thinking I just might stay
On Melody Road
Melody Road, let's go a mile
I'll tie up my rambling shoes
Write me a song to make you smile
There's no need to sing the blues on Melody Road
Melodies that unfold
Melodies made of gold
Making up songs along the way
I'm thinking I just might stay
On Melody Road
Ringing out like a bell
Singing out I can't tell
I'm not alone
Melody Road, it's you and me
Floating out on a dream
I love every song that comes to me
'Cause I know it comes to be
On Melody Road
Melody Road
Melody Road
Melody Road
Melody Road
