<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="Someday_Baby">
Someday, baby
It's gonna be alright
Someday, maybe, but baby, not tonight
There's a gleam in your eyes
That's for some other guy not for me now
He'll be kissing the lips
That I just get to kiss in my dreams now
But someday baby, yeah (uh huh)
Someday love
Someday, baby
It's gonna be just me
One day baby, well, you just wait and see
Girl, you'll open your eyes
And then you'll realize what I'm sayin'
I've got lovin' to give for as long as I live
He's just playin'
But someday baby, yeah (mmmmm)
Someday love
Someday baby, someday love
Someday baby
Someday love
