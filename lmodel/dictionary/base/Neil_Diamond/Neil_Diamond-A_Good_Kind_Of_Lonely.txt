<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="A_Good_Kind_Of_Lonely">
When, we say good night
I got to feelin' blue
I'm holey when you leave me
Alone, yeah
But in my heart I know
That you'll be back in, so
I may be blue but it's a
-ah oh oh yeah-
A good kind of lonely
I'm the happiest
When you're by my side
But there are times
When we must be apart
Then I just think of when
You'll hold me close again
And I'm not sad 'cause it's a
-ah oh oh yeah-
A good kind of lonely
A bad kind of lonely
Is the kind that you have
When love says goodbye
Turns your heart inside out
Makes you want to die oh oh
But as long as I have you
I know I won't be blue
You make me happy
Just by bein' around, yeah
And when you go away
I'll never be afraid uh huh
I know you leave me with a
-ah oh oh yeah-
A good kind of lonely
A good kind of lonely
