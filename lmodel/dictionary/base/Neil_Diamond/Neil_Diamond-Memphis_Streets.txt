<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="Memphis_Streets">
I'm headed for Memphis, ridin' a '59 Ford
Good paying job, girl
Bein' alone makes it hard
Find myself taking rides
Through the Memphis streets
Look out and watch the view
Girl, you know I don't see a thing
Can't get my mind off of you
Na na na na na na na na na na na na
Work on the day shift
Come back to my three dollar room
I'm a ten dollar dreamer
And I'm going to make it come true
But now I'm taking rides
Through the Memphis streets
Look out and watch the view
Girl, you know I don't see a thing
Can't get my mind off of you
Na na na na na na na na na na na na
Find myself taking rides
Through the Memphis streets
Look out and watch the view
Girl, you know I don't see a thing
Can't get my mind off of you.
Na na na na na na na na na na na na
Taking rides through the Memphis streets
Look out and watch the view
Girl, you know I don't see a thing
Can't get my mind off of you.
