<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="'Til_You've_Tried_Love">
Did you ever want to know
How it feels to be in love
To be really in love-ove
Did you ever want to feel the caress
And say baby you were sent from above-ove
Well I'm a-telling you
It's not so hard to do
And it'll carry you through
Listen to what I say
You've got to
Give a little lovin
'Cause I know what I'm talkin'
Try a little kissin'
You don't know what you're missin'
Till my friend, my friend you've tried love
If you decide to call it a day
And find another love that suit you way-ay
But before she remember
You'll be burned in December
If you don't listen to what I say
Well I'm a-telling you
It's not so hard to do
And it'll carry you through
Listen to what I say
You've got to
Give a little lovin
'Cause I know what I'm talkin'
Try a little kissin'
You don't know what you're missin'
Till my friend, my friend you've tried love
Well I'm a-telling you
It's not so hard to do
And it'll carry you through
Listen to what I say
You've got to
Give a little lovin
'Cause I know what I'm talkin'
Try a little kissin'
You don't know what you're missin'
Till my friend, my friend you've tried love
Till my friend, my friend you've tried love
Till my friend, my friend you've tried love
Till my friend, my friend you've tried love
