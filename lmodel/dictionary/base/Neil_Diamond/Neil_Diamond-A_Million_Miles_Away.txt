<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="A_Million_Miles_Away">
Every time that we're together,
I'm alone
When you're by my side,
You're far away
And you treat me like
Someone that you've never known
You seem to be a million miles away
Our love's become a one way episode
You don't even hear a word I say
And darlin' when I ask you
What's been goin' on,
Your answer seems
A million miles away
The things you do
Just have one meaning
There's no use trying to pretend
Oh darling, what I would give
To find out that I'm dreaming,
But I know, we've reached the end
I can see you found
Someone more dear to you,
Your eyes tell what your lips never say
And every day
Your lover grows more near to you
But I remain, a million miles away
Yes I remain, a million miles away
