<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="Me_Beside_You">
Could've been me beside you, baby
Could've been me beside you
But I wasn't smart
Isn't it kind of funny, baby
Isn't it kind of funny,
Two of us apart
Sayin' it's kind of funny, baby
But it's the kind of funny
That can break your heart
All through the night
I can see you
All through the night
I call your name
Close my eyes and
I see you coming back to me
Wonder, could it be that way again
And I lie awake
And think of what we could have been
While you're lying there with him
Could've been me beside you, baby
Could've been me beside you
I should be that guy
Sayin' it's kind of funny
But it's the kind of funny
That can make you cry
All through the night
I can see you
All through the night
I call your name
Close my eyes and
I see you coming back to me
But I know that it's only in my head
'Cause I lie awake
And think of what I should have said
And you're there with him instead
Should've been me beside you, baby
Should've been me beside you
I should be that guy
Never had time to take you dancin'
Never had time for dancin'
And I don't know why
Isn't it time we got together
Isn't it time we try it
Back to you and I
Could've been me beside you, baby
Could've been me beside you
I should be that guy
Could've been me beside you, baby
Could've been me beside you
