<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="O_Come,_O_Come_Emmanuel_-_We_Three_Kings_Of_Orient_Are">
O come, O come, Emmanuel,
And ransom captive Israel,
That mourns in lonely exile here
Until the Son of God appear
Rejoice, rejoice!
Emmanuel
Shall come to thee, O Israel
We three kings of orient are
Field and fountain,
Moor and mountain,
Following yonder star.
O star of wonder, star of night,
Star with royal beauty bright,
Westward leading, still proceeding
Guide us to that perfect Light.
We three kings of Orient are
Bearing gifts we traverse afar
Field and fountain
Moor and mountain,
Following yonder star
O Rejoice, rejoice
Westward leading, still proceeding,
Guide us to thy perfect Light
Star of wonder
Star so bright
