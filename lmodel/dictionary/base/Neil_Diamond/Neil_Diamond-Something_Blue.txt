<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="Something_Blue">
I came with a little bit of sorrow
Was maybe a bit too sad
But one day rolled into tomorrow
And you gave me the best you had
That's how we started together
And how together we're gonna stay
You taught me a little 'bout good times
I fought through a little bit of rain
You brought me a part of your sunshine
You took in the heart of my pain
It wasn't supposed to happen
But then you happened to come my way
Every night, every day
Every word that you say made it so
Every thought that I had
Said I ought to be glad. Now I know
You showed what a little bit of love can do
You opened my eyes and a light came through
Took me to a place that I never knew
Goodbye to my little bit of something blue
You came and you found me wanting
And I'm saying that I'm in your debt
Some days were a little bit daunting
Some days I'd rather forget
You changed my life for the better
And I know I'd better be good to you
Every night, every day
Every word that you say made it so
Every thought that I had
Said I ought to be glad, now I know
You showed what a little bit of love can do
You opened my eyes and a light came through
Took me to a place that I never knew
So long to my little bit of something blue
It wasn't supposed to happen
But then you happened to come my way
Every night, every day
Every word that you say made it so
Every thought that I had
Said I ought to be glad, now I know
You showed what a little bit of love can do
You opened my eyes and a light came through
Took me to a place that I never knew
Goodbye to my little bit of something blue
Farewell to my little bit of something blue
