<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="Away_In_A_Manger">
Away in a manger
No crib for a bed
The little Lord Jesus
Laid down his sweet head
The stars in the sky
Looked down where he lay
The little Lord Jesus
Asleep on the hay
The cattle are lowing
The poor baby wakes
But little Lord Jesus
No crying he makes
I love you, Lord Jesus
Look down from the sky
And stay by my cradle
Until morning is nigh
Away in a manger
No crib for a bed,
The little Lord Jesus
Laid down his sweet head
The stars in the sky
Looked down where he lay
The little Lord Jesus
Asleep on the hay
The little Lord Jesus
Asleep on the hay
