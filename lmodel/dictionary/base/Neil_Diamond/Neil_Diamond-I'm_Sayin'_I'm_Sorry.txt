<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="I'm_Sayin'_I'm_Sorry">
I'm sitting up here and drinkin'
She's sittin' down there and thinkin'
Got on her tape of Evita Perona
And my Smith Corona
Keeps saying I'm sorry
I'm saying I'm sorry
And then I'm saying goodnight
She's sittin' up there and fumin'
She thinks I'm something inhuman
She'd rather be with Paul Newman
I know her
And my Smith Corona
Keeps saying I'm sorry
I'm saying I'm sorry
And then I'm saying goodnight
Good Night
Good Night
Baby, you know that I love you
All right
Gonna be alright
Let's call it a lesson we've learned
She's not an easy forgiver
Could throw myself in the river
She send me back do it once more
An encore and what's more
Use the back door
Well, I'm saying I'm sorry
I'm saying I'm sorry
And then I'm saying goodnight
Good Night
Good Night
Baby, you know that I love you
All right
Gonna be alright
Just call it a lesson we've learned
She's sitting up there and waitin'
Hey dummy quit hesitating
Take off that tape of Evita Perona
Turn off that corona
And tell her you're sorry
I'm saying I'm sorry
And then I'm saying goodnight
And then I'm saying goodnight
And then I'm saying goodnight
