Mountains Of Love
Someday, make your way down the coast of South Africa.
There you will say
they're in need of a mountain of love.
Sail away, and you reach all the way down to China.
Don't look away.
They're in need of what we've plenty of.
Got enough to surround every living thing we see.
There's enough to include even you and me.
So just keep on tryin',
climbin' to the top.
Check out that view from above.
At the top,
there's mountains of love.
In the end,
Love is what I'm talkin' of.
'Round the bend,
there's mountains of love,
mountains of love.
I know from the glow that I see in the smallest child
that we can go higher still than we ever dreamed of.
Don't you know
there are magical places inside the heart?
Come on, let's go.
We got room on that mountain of love,
room enough to surround every living thing we seel
room enough to include even you and me.
So just keep on tryin',
climbin' to the top.
Check out that view from above.
At the top, there's mountains of love.
In the end,
love always seems to shine through.
'Round the bend
for me and for you,
there's mountains of
(Love's all right, mountains made of love.
Love's all right, mountains of love.)
(Love's all right, mountains made of love.
Love's all right, mountains of love.)
To the top,
let's check out that view from above.
It never stops.
There's mountains of love.
In the end, love always seems to shine through,
'round the bend for me and for you.
At the top, top of those mountains of love...
At the top,
got more than enough.
