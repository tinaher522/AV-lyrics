<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="The_Drifter">
Well, I'm the drifter
I walk the highways
I cross the river
That rolls on forgotten
I sing for the living
And live for the trying
But what's it about
If you got to be trying alone
And I'm the dreamer
Who climbed the mountain
I saw forever across the ocean
But you found me waitin'
And you knew that I would
Be lost forever
If I kept on trying alone
They'd call me the drifter
And I walked the highways
I crossed every river
That rolled on forgotten
I'd sing for the living,
But inside was dying
But what's it about
If you got to be trying alone
Well, I'm the drifter
Who saw the answer
And when I found you, I knew forever
It would be forever
And not for sometimes
And you'd be mine
Won't have to be trying alone
Now I sing like a dreamer
And I walk like I'm flying
I looked in your eyes
There was no use denying
You cared for that moment
And I knew the answer
I came for a while
And I stayed for the rest of my life
I came for a while
And I stayed for the rest of my life
I came for a while
And I stayed for the rest of my life
Well, I was the drifter
I walked the highways
I crossed every river
That rolled on forgotten
I sang for the living
And lived for the trying
I came for a while
And I stayed for the rest of my life
