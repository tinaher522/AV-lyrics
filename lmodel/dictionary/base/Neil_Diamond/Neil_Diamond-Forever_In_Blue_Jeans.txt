<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="Forever_In_Blue_Jeans">
Money talks 
But it don't sing and dance 
And it don't walk
As long as i can have you here with me
I'd much rather be
Forever in blue jeans
Honey's sweet
But it ain't nothin' next to baby's treat
And if you pardon me i'd like to say
We'll do ok
Forever in blue jeans
Maybe tonight
Maybe tonight,
By the fire all alone,you and I
Nothing around 
But the sound of my heart
And your sighs
Money talks 
But it can't sing and dance 
And it can't walk
As long as i can have you here with me
I'd much rather be
Forever in blue jeans, babe
and Honey's sweet
But it ain't nothin' next to baby's treat
And if you pardon me 
I'd like to say
We do ok
Forever in blue jeans
Maybe tonight
Maybe tonight,
By the fire all alone,you and I
Nothing around 
But the sound of my heart
And your sighs
And money talks 
But it don't sing and dance
And it don't walk
Long as I can have you here with me
I'd much rather be
Forever in blue jeans
And if you pardon me 
I'd like to say 
We do okay
forever in blue jeans, babe
As long as I can have you here with me
I'd much rather be 
Forever in blue jeans, babe
