<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="Do_It">
Do it
While your soul's still burning
Don't hide the yearning away
Say what you wanna say
Cause if you let her go
You'll always know
You blew it
Go thru it
And do it, yeah
Do it, yeah
Tell her
Just how much you love her
And that no other could do
What she does to you
Cause if you take your time
You're gonna find
You blew it
Go thru it
And do it, yeah
Do it, yeah
