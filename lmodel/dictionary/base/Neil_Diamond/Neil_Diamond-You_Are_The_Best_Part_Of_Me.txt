<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="You_Are_The_Best_Part_Of_Me">
My baby's Cryin' on a Saturday night
She thinks that nothin's ever gonna go right
But she'll make it
And we'll make it
There's not way that
I'm leavin' the best part of me
There was a time I wanted out on my own
I even thought that I'd be ok alone
But oh, baby
I know, baby
That I'd be walkin'
Away from the best part of me
Chorus:
You are the best part of me
The best that I am
Or ever will be
You baby, your the part
That allows me 
To open my heart 
And let love inside
I want you to know
What I've always 
known
You are the best
Part of me
Love isn't easy and
It's not always kind
Sometimes you only
Have to make
Up your mind
That you can make it
and you can make it
I know I made it
By keeping the best part of me
My baby's cryin' 'cause she cant run away
And if she could it wouldn't last for a day
And she knows it
And I know it
It just shows that
She is the best part of me
It's true baby, your the best part of me
The best that I am
Or ever will be
You baby, you're the part that allows me
To open my heart 
And let love inside
I want you to know
What I've always known
You're the best part of me
Yes, you are the best part of me
