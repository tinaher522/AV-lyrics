<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="Hey_Louise">
Hey, my Louise,
If I take you home,
Will you make me plead?
My sweet amour
If I come to close, will you close the door?
Oh ma cherie, do you know my name?
I remember yours
And I know what you need
What you need my Louise
Hey my Louise,
I can stand the heat,
But don't let me freeze
Merci beaucoup, it's a natural thing
When it's me and you
Oh ma cherie, do you know my name?
I remember yours
And I know what you need
What you need my Louise
Oh ma cherie, do you know my name?
I remember yours
And I know what you need
What you need my Louise
Need, what you need my Louise
What you need my Louise
