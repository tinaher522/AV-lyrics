<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="You're_So_Sweet,_Horseflies_Keep_Hangin'_'Round_Your_Face">
You're so sweet horseflies keep hangin' round your face
Kentucky moonshine could never take your place
And your eyes could give me goosebumps down to my toes
Feel like the only rooster in the henhouse,
I guess it shows.
Mary Lou Jane
Oh, what a fine name
And you're nothin' like those females in New York City
Front teeth missin'
But that's fine for kissin'
You're more loyal than my dog Sam
and twice as pretty.
You're so sweet horseflies keep hangin' round your face
Kentucky moonshine could never take your place
And your eyes could give me goosebumps down to my toes
Feel like the only rooster in the henhouse,
I guess it shows
I can't forget
When we first met
It was bull-wrasslin' time at the country fair rodeo
And I almost cried
When you won first prize
You just kicked them critters in the face and down they'd go.
You're so sweet horseflies keep hangin' round your face
Kentucky moonshine could never take your place
And your eyes could give me goosebumps down to my toes
Feel like the only rooster in the henhouse,
I guess it shows
