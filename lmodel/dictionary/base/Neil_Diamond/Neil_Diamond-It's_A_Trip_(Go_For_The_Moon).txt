It's a trip on a Ferris wheel
It's a game that you play for real
And so you know that if you're takin' it
Hey, you better not be fakin' it
It's a riff on an alto sax
Crying out so you can't relax
But you can tell it when he's fakin' it
So don't you ever be fakin' it
It's hard enough to be makin' it
If it's a trip and it's going
To have to end someday too soon
Let's take a trip to the moon
Come on, let's go for the moon
It's a ride on an astro plane
It's a trip down a one-way lane
So just forget about them secret doubts
It's something baby you can live without
Yeah, it's a trip, make it last a while
Life's a cup, fill it up in style
You got your dreams, you gotta live it out
The love you have, you gotta give it out
If that ain't life, then what's it all about
If it's a trip and it's going
To have to end someday too soon
Let's take a trip to the moon, yeah
C'mon let's go for the moon
It's a trip
Yeah, it's a trip, make it last a while
Life's a cup, fill it up in style
You got your dreams, you gotta live it out
The love you have, you gotta give it out
If that ain't life, then what's it all about
If it's a trip and it's going
To have to end someday too soon
Let's take a trip to the moon
Come on, let's go for the moon
I want to go to the moon
Let's take a trip to the moon
