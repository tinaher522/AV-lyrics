<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="I_Got_The_Feelin'_(Oh_No,_No)">
Oh no, no, no, no
Baby, something's wrong
Oh no, no, no, no
That old time fire is gone
It's not so much the things you say, love
It's what you don't say I'm afraid of...
I got the feelin' I'm hearin' goodbye
Don't have to say it
It's there in your eyes
Oh why, oh my
Oh no, no, no, no
You don't smile the same
Oh no, no, no, no
Like you been hidin' pain
I love you so much, I could taste it
But girl, your eyes tell me it's wasted
I got the feelin' I'm hearin' goodbye
Don't have to say it
It's there in your eyes
Oh why, oh my
Oh no, oh no no
Oh no, baby I got the feelin'
I'm hearin' goodbye
I got the feelin' that I'm gonna die, girl
I got the feelin'
Oh yes I do girl
I got the feelin'
That I'm losin' you
