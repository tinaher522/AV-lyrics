<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="Beatles_Medley:_Golden_Slumbers,_Carry_That_Weight,_The_End">
Once there was a way
To get back home again
Once there was a way
To get back home
Sleep pretty darlin' do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby
Golden slumbers fill your eyes
Smiles to greet you when you rise
Sleep pretty darlin' do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby
You never gave me your pillow
You only gave me your invitation
And in the middle of the celebration
I pray now
Hey boy, you got to carry that weight
Carry that weight a long time
Boy, you got to carry that weight
Carry that weight a long time
Boy, you got to carry that weight
Carry that weight a long time
And in the end,
The love we take
Is equal to the love we make......
