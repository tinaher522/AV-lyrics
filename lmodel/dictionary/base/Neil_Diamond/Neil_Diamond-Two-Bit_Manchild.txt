<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="Two-Bit_Manchild">
I'm walkin'
But I'm going nowhere at all
I'm 'bout to head any place in the world
But the place that I am
I'm talkin'
Hey, heh, heh
But baby, you don't understand
Na na na na na na na na na
Bad times, I can't take 'em
Good times, got to make 'em
Got to find 'em, got to taste 'em
Hey, and I do, I say I do
Mama I do
Two bit manchild I was
Born for nothin' mostly
Good time with sometime women
Nothin' ain't ever hold me
You can't change me none
Na na na na na
You want me
And I can't deny, I 'm a man
But I go no eyes for a tight pair of shoes
When my bare feet'll do
You need me
Hey, heh, heh
The wind is where I got my roots
Na na na na na na na na na
Bad times, I can't take 'em
Good times, got to make 'em
Got to find 'em, got to taste 'em
Hey and I do, I say I do
Mama I do...
Two bit manchild I was
Born for nothin' mostly
Good times with sometime women
Nothin' ain't ever hold me
You can't change me none
Na na na na na
I do, I say I do
Mama, Mama I do...
Two bit manchild I was
Born for nothin' mostly baby
Good time women
Good time lovin'
Hear what I 'm saying, baby
Two bit manchild
Good for nothin'
