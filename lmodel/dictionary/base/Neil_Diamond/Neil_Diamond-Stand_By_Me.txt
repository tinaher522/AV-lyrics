<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="Stand_By_Me">
When the night has come
And the land is dark
And the moon is the only light we'll see
No, I won't be afraid
No, I won't be afraid
Just as long as you stand,
Stand by me
So darling, darling,
Stand by me,
Oh, stand by me
Oh, stand,
Stand by me
Stand by me
If the sky that we look upon
Should tumble and fall
Or the mountains
Should crumble in the sea
I won't cry, I won't cry,
No I won't shed a tear
Just as long as you stand,
Stand by me
So darling, darling,
Stand by me,
Oh, stand by me
Oh, stand,
Stand by me
Stand by me
