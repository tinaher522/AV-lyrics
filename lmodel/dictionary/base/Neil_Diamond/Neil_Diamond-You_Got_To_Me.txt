<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="You_Got_To_Me">
Mama told me that someday it would happen
But she never said that it would happen like this
Papa said, "Look out, some girl'll catch you nappin'
Some little girl will get to you with her kiss"
You got to me
You brought me to my knees
Never thought I'd say please, girl
You got to my soul
You got control
You got to me, you got to be mine
Used to slip thru every girl's hands like water
There never was one who could ever tie me down
Straight ahead and steady as Gibraltar
'Til a lil girl brought me tumblin' to the ground
You got to me
You brought me to my knees
Never thought I'd say please, girl
You got to my soul
You got control
You got to me, you got to be mine
Alright
You got to me
And brought me to my knees
Never thought I'd say please, girl
You got to my soul
You got control
You got to me, you got to be mine
You got to me girl
Alright, come on
Said, you got to me now
