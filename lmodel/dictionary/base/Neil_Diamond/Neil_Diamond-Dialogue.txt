<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="Dialogue">
Thank you in the audiance that pays
"Tree people" out there
God Bless You;
I'll sing it for you too.
Are you still there, "tree people"?
This is the Greek Theater. 
This is the place that God made for performers when they die. 
They come to a place called the Greek theater and youÂ´re met there by an MC wearing a long robe and smoking a cigar
.....looks like Guy Kibbie
....and that's what it is
...it's performers paradise. 
Take a look behind you and see what I'm seein'
....like trees in the sky
....it's beautiful! 
This is going to be special, 
I promised that before I came back to this theater 
We're going to do some things that you won't forget for a while
And thats where we're bound tonight, ok.
