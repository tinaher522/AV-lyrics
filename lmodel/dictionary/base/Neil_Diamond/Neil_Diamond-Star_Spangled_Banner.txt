<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="Star_Spangled_Banner">
Oh, say can you see,
By the dawn's early light
What so proudly we hailed
At the twilight's last gleaming?
Whose broad stripes and bright stars,
Through the perilous fight
O'er the ramparts we watched
Were so gallantly streaming?
And the rockets' red glare
The bombs bursting in air
Gave proof through the night
That our flag was still there.
O say,
Does that star-spangled banner yet wave
O'er the land of the free
And the home of the brave?
