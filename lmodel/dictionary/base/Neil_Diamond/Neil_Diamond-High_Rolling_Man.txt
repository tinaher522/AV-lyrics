Words and Music by Neil Diamond
Roll 'em in the morning, roll without no warning, 
Hot damn, hot damn, hot damn, you know that he could and he would, 
He's a high rollin' man in a high rollin' neighborhood.
Roll 'em, roll 'em, roll 'em, roll 'em, roll 'em, roll 'em.
Don't do much good, but good Lord, he could roll 'em.
Lord, he was a dreamer, hardly worth redeeming,
Hot damn, hot damn, hot damn, you know that he was, Lord, he was,
But when it comes to his thumbs, ain't a man who can do what he does.
Roll 'em, roll 'em, roll 'em, roll 'em, roll 'em, roll'em, 
Don't do much good, but good Lord, he could roll 'em.
Roll 'em, roll 'em, roll 'em, roll 'em, roll 'em, roll 'em, 
Don't do much good, but good Lord, he could roll 'em.
Roll 'em, roll 'em, roll 'em, roll 'em, roll 'em, roll 'em,
Don't do much good, but good Lord, he could roll 'em.
