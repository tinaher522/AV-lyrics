Written by: Neil Diamond and Richard Bennett
Something's gotta be known
Some don't need to be said
Which way we're gonna go
Staying home's just making me mad
Me, I gotta get out
Me, I got a few rights
Don't need to worry or doubt
'Cause I'm gonna be rocking tonight
Get on board
Check it out
Look around,
Ain't no limit to what love allows
You and me
Let it be
Be just fine
No limit to it anytime
Me, I'm telling the truth
Saying it right in the crowd
Any chance with you
Hey you know I'm gonna be around
Get on board
Check it out
Look around,
Ain't no limit to what love allows
If we don't make it
We don't make it
I won't cry
Well, I've been thinking
And I know one thing
We're never gonna make it
If we don't try
Me, I'm feeling good
Ain't no fooling around
I've been misunderstood
But I know what I'm talking about
Get on board
Check it out
Look around,
Ain't no limit to what love allows
You and me
Got to fly
Set it free
No limit if you just know how
Ain't no limit to what love allows
