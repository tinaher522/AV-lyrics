<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="Singin'_In_The_Rain">
I'm singing in the rain
Just singing in the rain
What a glorious feeling
I'm happy again
I'm laughing at clouds
So dark up above
'Cause the sun's in my heart
And I'm ready for love
Let the stormy clouds chase
Everyone from the place
Come on with the rain
I've a smile on my face
I'll walk down the lane
With a happy refrain
'Cause I'm singing
Just singing in the rain
