<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="Baby_Let's_Drive">
Hey, if you ever want to get away a while
I got something you want to know
Sometime when your world is on fire
You got to pack your bags and then go
Hey, don't you know you don't belong here
Why don't you come along with me
I'm gonna take you right out of the picture
Put you right into a brand new scene
Open road ahead is all we need
Something says to go and we just leave
And it feels right
Drive, baby, let's drive
We're gonna drive to the edge of the night
Two of us gone
Leavin' the world and the worry behind
Makin' up time
Baby, let's drive
Hey, yeah
So if you really want to get away quick
You need to get with a brand new beat
People around you just a little to slick
I got room here in my front seat
Hey, little girl just sittin' on a high fence
Ain't there a place you'd much rather be
Waitin' around here ain't makin' no sense
I got a way of gettin' us free
Open road ahead is all we want
Somethin' says to go and then we're gone
And it feels right
Drive, baby, let's drive
We're gonna drive to the edge of the night
Two of us gone
Leavin' the world and the worry behind
Makin' up time
Baby, let's drive, c'mon now
So if you really want to chase the moon
I got a way to makin' it real
Turn up the sound on a get away tune
Can't wait to get behind the wheel
Yeah, if you really want to get out baby
Take you to where you want to be
Seem just a little bit lost, so baby
Why don't you come along and see
Open road is all we'll ever need
Never know where open roads can lead
And it feels right
Drive, baby, let's drive
We're gonna drive to the edge of the night
Two of us gone
Leavin' the world and the worry behind
Makin' up time
We gonna drive
Come on and drive
Everybody, let's drive
Start up and get free
Drive, c'mon and drive
Yeah, baby, let's drive
