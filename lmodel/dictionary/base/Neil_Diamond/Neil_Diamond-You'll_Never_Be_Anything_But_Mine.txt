<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="You'll_Never_Be_Anything_But_Mine">
Do what you want to do
Say what you want to say
I won't ever, ever stop believing that
You'll never be anything but mine
Tell me there's someone else
Who's gonna share your kiss
I don't care and I know
You'll never be anything but mine
You run around all over town
But it won't be for long
But you'll be back after you've found
That our love's just to strong
Go where you want to go
Do what you want you want to do
I'll be waiting 'cause I know
You'll never be anything but mine
