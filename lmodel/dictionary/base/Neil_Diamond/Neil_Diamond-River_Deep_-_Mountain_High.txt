<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="River_Deep_-_Mountain_High">
When you were a little girl
You had a rag doll
The only doll you've ever owned
Now I love you
Just the way you loved that rag doll
But only now my love has grown
And it gets stronger in every way
And it gets deeper baby, let me say
And it gets higher, day by day
Do I love you my, oh my
River deep, mountain high
If I lost you would I cry
Oh how I love you baby
Baby, baby, baby
When you were a young girl
Did you have a puppy
That always followed you around
Well I'm gonna be as faithful
As that puppy
You know I'll never let you down
Cause it goes on and on
Like a river flows
And it gets bigger baby
And heaven knows
And it gets sweeter baby
As it grows
Do I love you my, oh my
River deep, mountain high
And if I lost you would I cry
Oh how I love you baby
Baby, baby, baby
I love you baby
Like a flower loves the spring
And I love you baby
Like a robin loves to sing
And I love you baby
Like a schoolboy loves his pi
And I love you baby
River deep, mountain high
Do I love you my, oh my
River deep, mountain high
If I lost you would I cry
Oh how I love you baby
Baby, baby, baby
