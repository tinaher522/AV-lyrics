<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="Suite_Sinatra_I've_Got_You_Under_My_Skin-One_For_My_Baby">
I've got you under my skin
I've got you deep in the heart of me
So deep in my heart
You're really a part of me
I've got you under my skin
I've tried so not to give in
I've said to myself
This affair never will go so well
But why should I try to resist
When darling I know so well
I've got you under my skin
So set 'em' up Joe
I got a little story
You outta know
I got the routine
So drop another nickel
In the machine
'Cause I've got her under my skin
I'd sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of having you near
In spite of a warning voice
That comes in the night
And repeats, repeats in my ear
Don't you know you little fool
You never can win
Use your mentality
Wake up to reality
But each time I do,
Just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
'Cause I've got you under my skin
So set 'em up Joe,
I got a little story
That you outta know
