<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="Stand_Up_For_Love">
I know this time what I'm feeling
Real love I believe in
Every night I see it in your eyes
They might say we won't make it
The road's too long
We can't take it
What we have
I know it's gonna be alright
Love's worth fighting for
I'm reaching towards
The mirror of my soul
Took so long to find but now you're mine
I can feel the power
(Stand up for love
I want to shout about it)
Oh, yeah
(Reach out and we can set the eagle free)
Stand up for love
(Stand up for love
Together we can make it)
Know we gonna make it
(We'll move mountains in our dreams)
Yes, stand up for love
(Stand up for love)
Oh, yeah
(And show the people we believe it
The world will never know
A sweeter song)
Stand up for love
(Rise up for love
Together we're in heaven)
Oh, yeah
(We'll move mountains with our dreams)
Time will not wait
Love won't hide away
Let's pull the blinds
For all the world to see
(Stand up for love
So good that we have found it)
Oh, yeah
(Oh we can't find a better place)
Stand up for love
(Stand up for love
We want to shout about it)
Shout about it
(We'll move mountains with our dreams)
Stand up for love
(Stand up for love
I want to shout about it)
Oh yeah
(Reach out and we can set the eagle free)
Stand up for love
(Stand up for love
Together we can make it)
Oh yeah
(We'll move mountains with our dreams)
