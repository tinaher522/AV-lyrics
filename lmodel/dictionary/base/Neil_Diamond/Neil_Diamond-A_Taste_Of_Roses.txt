<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="A_Taste_Of_Roses">
A taste of roses, that's what you gave me
And then you made me
Turn around and walk away
A taste of roses, that little moment
But I have sworn that I was born
For just that day
I was a child again
In a world orphaned with light
You showed me the day
And then you left me in the night
A taste of roses, that sweet beginning
Whose bitter end will be rememeber'd
Thru the years, with a taste of tears
A taste of tears
