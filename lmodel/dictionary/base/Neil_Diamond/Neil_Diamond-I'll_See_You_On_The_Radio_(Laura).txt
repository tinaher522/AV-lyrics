<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="I'll_See_You_On_The_Radio_(Laura)">
Laura,
It's not the end of the world
It's just the end of the summertime
Oh but Laura,
I never promised the world
Just till the end of the summer time
But, I'll see you on the radio
It's playin' our summer song
That same old song
It goes on and on
And the radio
Keeps sayin' the summers gone
But I keep hearing, Laura
Now it's autumn
Somebody is waiting for you
And someone is waiting to see me too
Yeah, but Laura
I want to see you again
I don't know how and
I don't know when
But till I do
I'll see you on the radio
It's playin' our summer song
That same old song
It goes on and on
And the radio
Keeps sayin' the summers gone
But I keep hearing you....
On the radio
They're playin' our summer song
That same old song
It goes on and on
On the radio
They're sayin' that's summers gone
But I keep seeing you
On the radio
It's playin' our summer song
That same old song
It goes on and on
