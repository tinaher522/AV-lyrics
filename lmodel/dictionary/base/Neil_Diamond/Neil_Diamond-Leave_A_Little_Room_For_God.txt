<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="Leave_A_Little_Room_For_God">
Leave a little room for God
As you're goin' through the day
Leave a little room for God
You know he won't get in your way
Save a little place inside
Somewhere you can call your own
Then leave a little room for God
And you won't ever be alone
Every day is so mysterious
You wonder how things came to be
And when you start to get real curious
Well, He's the man you'll want to see
So leave a little room for God
Just in case you need a friend
Everyone's got rainy days
It isn't so much if, but when
Life if like a gift we're given
Every single day is new
We're thankful for the time we're livin'
But thankful exactly to who
C'mon now,
Put your money in the bank
And drive around in a big old car
Just leave a little room for God
Or it won't take you very far
Yeah, leave a little room for God
As you're goin' down the road
He'll not only point the way
He's gonna help you with the load
Yeah, leave a little room for God
And thank your lucky stars above
That He'll be leaving room for you
He's always got some room for love
Leave a little room for God, my friend
And He'll have room for you
Just need to leave a little room for him too
