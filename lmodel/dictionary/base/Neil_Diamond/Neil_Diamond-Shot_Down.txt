<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="Shot_Down">
Shot Down,
Was a proud young bird
Flying high in the sky
I was shot down
Uh uh huh
I got 'round
Any sweet piece of pie I could take
I would buy
Now I'm shot down
She turned me out slammed the door.
Why I keep coming back I don't know.
I don't know.
I want her,
She's a four cornered girl
In a three cornered world
And I want her.
Uh huh I love her,
And I almost believe
I get down on my knees.
'Cause I love her.
Well can't you see my epitaph.
Shot down
By the one girl he couldn't have
Not have
Shot down
Baby I was shot down, come on
Shot down
Baby I was shot down
Shot down,
Baby I was shot down, come on
Shot down, I say, shot down
Whooo, shot down
Baby I was shot down
Shot down
Baby I was shot down...
