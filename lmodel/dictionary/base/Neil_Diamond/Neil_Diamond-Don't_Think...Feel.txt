<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="Don't_Think...Feel">
Sleepy old sun,
Sleepy old day,
Sleepy old tree
Gonna make me some shade.
Sleepy old time
On my side of town,
I'm feelin' fine,
I'll explain to you now.
Don't think, feel;
Ain't no big deal.
Just make it real
And don't think, feel.
It don't take plans
To clap your hands,
When it feels nice
Just don't think twice.
Some worry all day
Bout who they can trust,
Some worry all night
Bout money and lust.
Worry they do
And worry they die
And after they're gone
Just the bankers cry.
Don't think, feel;
Ain't no big deal.
Just make it real
And don't think, feel.
It don't take plans
To clap your hands,
When it feels nice
Just don't think twice.
Life is a card,
You take what you get.
You do what you can
To feel no regret.
You do what you can,
Forget about words,
Just go with the feelin'
It usu'lly works.
Don't think, feel;
Ain't no big deal.
Just make it real
And don't think, feel.
It don't take plans
To clap your hands
When it feels nice
Just don't think twice.
Don't think, feel;
Ain't no big deal.
Just make it real
And don't think, feel.
It don't take plans
To clap your hands
When it feels nice
Just don't think twice.
