<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="Forever_NYU">
Came down to Washington Square
And found my future was there
Violet and white on her mast
The beacon bright from her past
A place where dreams can come true
Forever NYU
In this city of dreams
You gave me my wings
For everything that I planned
For everything that I am
I know I owe it to you
Forever NYU
