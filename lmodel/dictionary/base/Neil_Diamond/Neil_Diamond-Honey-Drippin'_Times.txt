<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="Honey-Drippin'_Times">
Warm night time smells in the air
Sit on an old rockin' chair
Thinkin' back where I've been
Goin' back, once again
I can find honey-drippin' times
Honey-drippin' times
Kid's playin' games in the yard
Kids never know when times are hard
But they're kids and I'm not
I just see all I've got on my mind
Honey-drippin' times
Honey-drippin' times
(whistles)
Thinkin' back where I've been
Goin' back once again
I can find honey-drippin times
Honey drippin' times
(whistles)
