<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="Cherry,_Cherry_(Alternate_Version)">
Here comes sundown, don't you be late
Gonna be outta sight, yeah
Girl I'll run down, can't hardly wait
You and me in the night, yeah
Cherry Cherry
Come On, Cherry Cherry
Cherry Cherry
Come On Cherry Cherry
Whooo, Cherry
Tell your mama, girl, I can't stay long
We got things we gotta catch up on
Mmm, you know
You know what I'm sayin'
Can't stand still while the music is playin'
Thinking of you girl, keeps me awake
Ah ,what you do to me is frightening
Just us two girl, that's all it takes
Mmm, gonna make our own lightening
Cherry Cherry, Come On
Cherry Cherry
Cherry Cherry
Come On Cherry Cherry
Mmmm, Cherry
Tell your mama, girl, I can't stay long
We got things we gotta catch up on
Mmm, you know
You know what I'm sayin'
Can't stand still while the music is playin'
Cherry Cherry
Come On, Cherry Cherry
Cherry Cherry
Come On, Cherry Cherry
Cherry Cherry
Come On, Cherry Cherry
Cherry Cherry
Cherry Cherry
