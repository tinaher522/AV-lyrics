<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="You_Don't_Know_Me">
You don't know me
If you did
You would know if I loved you
Part of it's trust
And part of it's just being
When you loved me
Did you know
How I lived my life for you
Part of me died
And part of me just cried out
Say goodbye now
Don't lie anymore
When it's gone
We'll walk away
We'll move on
But if you loved me
Even now
Would you watch as I leave you
Maybe you would
And maybe I'd still be here
You don't know me
Don't try anymore
When it's gone
We'll walk away
We'll move on
But if you loved me
If you did
Would you watch as I leave you
Maybe you will
And maybe I will still be here
Trying to let go
You don't know me
Maybe I will still be here
