<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="And_The_Singer_Sings_His_Song">
Young it was
True it was
Days without wond'ring
Fall with a special thing
Laugh, I could laugh
And I did
And the singer sings his song
And the children dance along
And the singer sings his song
And we dance along
Good it was 
When it was, 
We chased the flowers
Warm summer showers
Once, it was once 
Long ago
And the singer sings his song
And the children dance along
And the singer sings his song
And we dance along
Once, it was once 
Long ago
And the singer sings his song 
And the children dance along 
And the singer sings his song 
And we dance along
And the singer sings his song
And we dance along
