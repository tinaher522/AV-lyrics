<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="At_The_Movies">
Movie show,
Where almost anything can happen
Movie time,
Anything you can imagine
C'mon, C'mon, C'mon, C'mon let's go
You got to see it to believe it
I hear that Hollywood's a very tough scene
Where else does someone eat their
Co-star on screen
Hey if you ever want to get away quick
There's nothing quicker then the movies
The guilty pleasure of a shoot-em-up flick
Enjoyed at leisure at the movie show
Bring along a new girl
Movie time,
And maybe sit a little closer
Look out, look out, look out, look out
Oh no I hear an alien comin'
And when she sees it
She'll be right in your seat
Is there a better way for people to meet
You want adventure
They discovered the stuff
Don't need to venture past the movies
You need romance,
They give you more than enough
They'll song and dance you
At the movie show
Movie show, hey the earth is in danger
Movie time and only one man can save us
C'mon, C'mon, C'mon, C'mon let's go
You know the odds are outrageous
And by the time he finally wins the fight
We're eating popcorn at the speed of light
You want to put yourself
Right into the scene
Well you can do it at the movies
Or maybe somethin'
That'll just make you scream
Why not go through it at the movies
You crave a mystery that boggles the mind
Well you can find it at the movies
A happy ending
That puts chills up your spine
There's one unwinding at the movie show,
Yeah
Love's made for finding at the movie show
