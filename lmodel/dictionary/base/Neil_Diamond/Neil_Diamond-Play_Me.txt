<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="Play_Me">
She was morning
And I was night time
I one day woke up
To find her lying
Beside my bed
I softly said
"Come take me"
For I've been lonely
In need of someone
As though I'd done
Someone wrong somewhere
I don't know where
Come lately
You are the sun
I am the moon
You are the words
I am the tune
Play me
Song she sang to me
Song she brang to me
Words that rang in me
Rhyme that sprang from me
Warmed the night
And what was right
Became me
You are the sun
I am the moon
You are the words
I am the tune
Play me
And so it was
That I came to travel
Upon a road
That was thorned and narrow
Another place
Another grace
Would save me
You are the sun
I am the moon
You are the word
I am the tune
Play me
