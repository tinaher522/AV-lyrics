<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="If_I_Couldn't_See_You_Again">
If I couldn't see you again
Life would make no sense at all to me
I could be a rich man, but why?
It wouldn't mean much, if I
Could never see you again
If I couldn't look in your eyes
How'm I gonna see tomorrow?
How'm I gonna know where to go?
I need to be at your side
Say what you want, babe
But I, I need to see you again
Things are gonna get serious
What a waste of a chance
For the two of us
What can I do?
Is it so mysterious?
I would be much less than I am
If I couldn't have you
And if there wasn't you in my life
All my life would be so empty
And if I couldn't see you again,
Be losing more than a friend
Don't even want to pretend
I need to see you again
Things are gonna get serious
What a waste of a chance
For the two of us
What can I do?
Is it so mysterious?
I would be much less than I am
If I couldn't have you
Know that it's true
How'm I gonna make you believe
What have I got left to give to you?
Maybe just a piece of my life
It wouldn't mean much, if I
Could never see you again
I need to see you again
