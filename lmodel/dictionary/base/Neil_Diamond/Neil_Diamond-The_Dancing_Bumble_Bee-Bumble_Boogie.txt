The Dancing Bumble Bee/
Bumble Bee Boogie
And when the hot winds blow tonight 
The dancing bumble bee takes flight 
And all the flowers in the field 
Prepare their nectar soon to yield 
Dance 
Dance 
Fly 
Fly 
Behold the dancing bumble bee 
And as they gather 'round to see 
His rhythm burns like a raging fire 
In passion by that sweet desire 
Dance 
Dance 
Fly 
Fly 
Dance 
Dance with me here tonight 
I'll make you warm and right 
I'll make you warm tonight 
Come dance 
He danced until the morning came 
Until the music's last refrain 
And though he knew it soon would end 
He only lived to dance again 
Dance 
Dance 
Fly 
Dance 
Dance with me here tonight 
I'll make you warm and right 
I'll make you warm tonight 
Come dance
Dance
Dance
Fly
