<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="Santa_Claus_Is_Comin'_To_Town">
You better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town
He's making a list
He's checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty or nice
Say it now,
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're awake,
Yes he does
He knows when you've been bad or good
So you better be good
You better be good, you better be good
You better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
Say, I'm telling you why
Come on now,
Santa Claus is coming to town.
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town
Oh yeah
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're awake,
Yes he does
He knows when you've been bad or good,
So you better be good
You better be good, you better be good
For goodness sake
Little tin horns, little toy drums.
Got Rudy-toot-toots
And some rummy tum tums.
Santa Claus is coming to town.
Santa Claus is coming to town, look out
Santa Claus is coming to town.
Here he comes kids
Can't stop the man no how
He remembers every little thing
You did all year
All those kind unspoken words
Keep up the good work guys
Yep, pretty soon now
