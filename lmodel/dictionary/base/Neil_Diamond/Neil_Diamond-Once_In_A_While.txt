<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="Once_In_A_While">
Once in a while I would call asking lonely to find you there
Once in a while I would call asking only to know
And once you were mine long ago when the evening was warm and free
Once you were mine when the evening was full with that glow
And who could have known we'd have flown far away from the way we were
Knowing the way we were
Once in a while, once in a while
And who could have known we'd have flown far away from the way we were
Knowing the way we were
Once in a while, once in a while
And who would have known, we'd have flown like two birds to another place
Only to find our space
Once in a while, once in a while
