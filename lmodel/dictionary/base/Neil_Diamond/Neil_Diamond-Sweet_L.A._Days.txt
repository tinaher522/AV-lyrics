Sweet L.A. Days
written by Neil Diamond and Doug Rhone
I can see it all now.
I will never forget
what you meant to me.
Don't have a single regret.
And I was feelin' alright
when it was just me and you.
We loved with all of our might.
That's all we wanted to do.
There ain't a lot we had to know
except that I wanted you
to be wherever I'd go.
Will anything ever be sweeter than those days?
Nobody's gonna replace
all that we shared with each other in those days,
back in those sweet L.A. days,
sweet L.A. days.
No one could ever replace
how on a Saturday night
we would jump in your car
and how we'd drive through the night
and maybe not get that far.
There wasn't much we had to learn
except that we knew the road would take us through every turn.
Will anything ever be sweeter than those days?
Nobody's gonna replace all that we shared
with each other in those days,
back in those sweet L.A. days, sweet L.A. days.
Ooee baby it's takin' me back,
back to those L.A. days,
sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet L.A. days.
They can't be taken away,
not those L.A. days, no,
those L.A. days,
sweet L.A. days.
