<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="Suzanne">
Suzanne takes you down
To her place by the river
You can hear the boats go by
You can spend the night forever
And you know the girl's half crazy
And that's why you want to be there
And she feeds you tea and oranges
That come all the way from China
And just when you want to tell her
That you have no love to give her
She gets you on her wavelength
And lets the river answer
That you've always been her lover
And Jesus was a sailor
When he walked upon the water
And he spent a long time watching
From the lonely wooden tower
And when he knew for certain
Only drowning men could see him
He said "All men are sailors then
Until the sea shall free them"
But he himself was broken
Long before the sky would open
Forsaken, almost human
He sank beneath your wisdom like a stone
And you want to travel with him
And you want to travel blind
And you think that you may trust him
For he's touched your perfect body
With his mind.
Suzanne takes you down
To her place by the river
You can hear the boats that go by
You can spend the night forever
And the sun pours down like honey
On our lady of the harbor
And she shows you where to look
Amid the garbage and the flowers
There are heroes in the seaweed
There are children in the morning
They are leaning out for love
And they will lean that way forever
While Suzanne holds her mirror
