<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="Forgotten">
Oh I try to right by you
Yeah, yeah, yeah where did it get me?
And I tried to do everything I knew
Don't seem fair cos look where you left me
You've got me waiting out in the back
Under a stack
Stuck in a bin
You been keeping me in
High on a shelf all by myself
Feeling like I'm doing my time
Under a sign
That reads forgotten
Forgotten
Now I'm sending out an S.O.S
Before I drown somebody save me
And I tried you know that I did my best
You took me down to where I been lately
You've got me waiting out in the back
Under a stack
Stuck in a bin
You been keeping me in
High on a shelf all by myself
Feeling like I'm doing my time
Under that sign
That reads forgotten
Forgotten
Been thinking bout you everyday
Baby not just now and then
There's got to be a better way
Don't wanna be f, o, r, go, t, t, e, n no
I'm feeling like I've been used
You were gone before we got started
And I know it ain't gonna make the news
You led me on then you departed
You've left me waiting out in the back
Under a stack
Stuck in a bin
That you been keeping me in
High on a shelf all by myself
Feeling like I'm doing my time
Under that sign
That reads forgotten
Forgotten
Forgotten
Forgotten
Forgotten
Forgotten
Forgotten
