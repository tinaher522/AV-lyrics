<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="Skybird">
Skybird
Make your sail
And every heart
Will know of the tale
[Spoken:]
And head for the farthest shore
Songbird
Make your tune
For none may sing it just as you do
[Spoken:]
And make your song be heard
Look at the way I glide
Caught on the winds lazy tide
Sweetly how it sings
Rally each heart
At the sight of your silver wings
Skybird
Skybird
Night bird
Find your way
For none may know it just as you may
[Spoken:]
Seek out your harbor of light
Let your song be heard
Rally each heart
To the sight of your silver wings
Skybird
