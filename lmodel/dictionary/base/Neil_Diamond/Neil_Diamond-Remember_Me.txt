Remember Me

Maybe tonight, just for this moment
We'll feel the same things, we did before
Just close your eyes, and let me show you
You'll be my reason, and I'll be yours
Remeber me
Well, I'm the boy that stood in line for
Have you got just a little time for me tonight
I'll make you feel alright
Hey do you remember me
Remember when
The world was ours for just one evening
Felt so warm, it's hard believing
That it would end
And here we are again
Hey do you remember me
Remember how
Music filled the empty spaces
And took us off to distant places
We'd never seen
Do you remember now
I still got my song and I can sing it
My guitar plays beneath my fingers
Warm, baby warm, baby warm
Say, do you remember me
Well, I'm the boy you gave your heart to
Don't you think we've been apart too long this time
But you've been on my mind
Say, do you remember me
Remember how
Music filled the empty spaces
And took us off to distant places
We'd never seen
Do you remember now
I still got my song and I can sing it
My guitar plays beneath my fingers
Warm, baby warm, baby warm
Say, do you remember me
- Remember Me
