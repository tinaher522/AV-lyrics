<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="Lost_In_Hollywood">
I get up in the morning and I go to work
I try to keep busy but I feel the hurt
I see you around me ev'rywhere I turn
But you're gone - lost in Hollywood
You got up one morning,
Said you had to go
You would've gone
Even if I told you "no"
And all I could say was,
"Baby just take it slow,
You take care,
Don't get lost in Hollywood"
You had your dream, you had to find it
I begged you, "Girl, please don't go"
Now when I call to find if you're in
The answer always is "no"
You had to make it on your own
Just had to do it all alone for a while
Was not a lot that I could say
You had to have it your own way,
I suppose
Like some river that flows to the sea
And I should've known
That in time you would be leaving me
Leaving me
Hey, has anybody seen my girl
She's lost in Hollywood
Hey, has anybody seen my girl
She's lost in Hollywood
I get home in the evening
But I just can't sleep
I lay on your pillow
And I feel your heat
And ev'rything here
Just keeps on reminding me
That you're gone - lost in Hollywood
I walk the streets, it sounds of laughter
But I hear only the pain
The morning comes,
The sunshine greets me
But I feel only the rain
But something gets me through the day
Something in my heart keeps saying to me
I just know you can't be far away
When you come home
Ev'rything's going to work out okay
Okay
Hey, has anybody seen my girl
She's lost in Hollywood
Hey, has anybody seen my girl
She's lost in Hollywood
If you know where to find her
Then kindly remind her
While searching for finer
She's left love behind her
Yeah
Hey, has anybody seen my girl
She's lost in Hollywood
Hey, has anybody seen my girl
She's lost in Hollywood
