<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="You_Baby">
One, Two, Three Four!
Hey, it takes a lot of time
If you want it right
Takes a lot of time
And it takes believin'
You gotta see the signs
And you'll get it right
I see the signs in your eyes
And I know that it's
You, baby, baby
Ooh, baby, baby now
You, baby, baby
Only a blind man would leave you behind
But not me
It takes a lot of lovin' to make it good
Takes a lot of lovin', believe it, babe
I'm sayin' it again so it's understood
Me,
I believe in the things I keep seein' in
You, baby, baby
Ooh, baby, baby now
You, baby, baby
Only a blind man would leave you behind
But not me
Hey
It takes a lot of lovin' to make it good
Takes a lot of love and believin' babe
I'm sayin' it again so it's understood
Me, I believe in the things
I keep seein' in
You, baby, baby
Ooh, baby, baby now
You, baby, baby
Ooh, baby, baby now
Ooh, baby, baby
You, baby, baby, now
Ooh, baby, baby
You, baby, baby now
You, baby, baby now
You, baby, baby now....
