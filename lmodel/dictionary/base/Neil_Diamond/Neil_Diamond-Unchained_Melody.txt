<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="Unchained_Melody">
Oh, my love, my darling
I hunger for your touch
Alone
Lonely time
Time goes by, so slowly
And time can do so much
Are you still mine?
I need your love
I need your love
Godspeed your love to me.
Lonely rivers flow to the sea
To the sea
To the open arms of the sea
Lonely rivers sigh
Wait for me, wait for me
I'll be coming home, wait for me
Oh, my love, my darling
I hunger for your touch
Alone
Lonely time
Time goes by, so slowly
And time can do so much
Are you still mine?
I need your love
I need your love
Godspeed your love to me
