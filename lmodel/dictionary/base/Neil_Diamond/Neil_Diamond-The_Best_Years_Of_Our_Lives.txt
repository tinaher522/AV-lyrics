<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="The_Best_Years_Of_Our_Lives">
Hey, listen to the working man
And can you hear the dream
That resides in his soul?
And when you hear that poor man singin'
Can you hear a story
That cries to be told?
Wanna hear you say "Oh yeah"
I need to hear you say "Oh yeah"
It's time to stand up and be counted
These are the days of our beginnings
This ain't the time for the faint of heart
No don't wanna lose
The chance we are given
These are the best years of our lives
The very best years of our lives
Oh yeah, hear the song of womankind
Carried 'til she ached
Now she's takin' her stand
Says she's got the right to be
Right beside and equal with ev'ry man
Wanna hear you say "Oh yeah"
Need to hear you say "Oh yeah"
It's time to stand up and be counted
These are the days of our beginnings
This ain't the time for the faint of heart
No don't wanna lose
The chance we're given
These are the best years of our lives
The very best years of our lives
Say "oh yeah"
Say it now, and just say it right
If you truly believe it,
You'll be saying it right.
So say "oh yeah"
Gotta say "oh yeah"
It's time to stand up and be counted
Better days are just beginning.
There ain't no place to run and hide to
Don't throw away
The chance we're given.
These are the best years of our lives
The very best years of our lives
Say "Oh yeah"
"Oh yeah"
Say "Oh yeah"
Say "Oh yeah"
These are the best years of our lives
