Written by: Neil Diamond and Stewart Harris
Tied by love to you, but I was tied too strong
Still I'm afraid of knowing what leaving means
I know I lived for you, and all I tried to do
You were the keeper of my dreams
Open wide these prison doors
Take these chains from around my heart
Make believe that I'm no more
And don't mind when I depart
Need to find another place
Where love is not just tossed away
If you really care for me
Open wide these prison doors
And set me free
You were always caring, always warm and kind
But that was long ago, when love was blind
And I don't want to hurt you, the way that I've been hurt
But if I stay I'll lose my mind
Open wide these prison doors
Take these chains from around my heart
Make believe that I'm no more
And don't mind when I depart
Need to find another place
Where love is not just tossed away
If you really care for me
Open wide these prison doors
And set me free
Time is always moving
While we're here standing still
I love you even though I'm leaving
And maybe I always will
But, open wide these prison doors
Take these chains from around my heart
Make believe that I'm no more
And don't mind when I depart
Need to find another place
Where love is not just tossed away
And if you really care for me
Open wide these prison doors
And set me free
If you really care for me
Open wide these prison doors
And set me free
Set me free, yeah
Come on and set me free
Set me free
