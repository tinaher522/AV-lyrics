<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="Teach_Me_Tonight">
Did you say I got a lot to learn
Well don't think I'm tryin' not to learn
Since this is the perfect spot to learn,
Teach me, tonight
Startin' with the A B C of it
Right down to the XYZ of it
Come help me solve the mystery of it
Teach me, tonight
The sky
It's a blackboard high above you
And if a shooting star goes by,
I'll use that star to write "I love you"
A thousand times across the sky
One thing isn't very clear, my love
Should the teacher stand so near, my love?
Graduation's almost here, my love
C'mon teach me tonight
The sky is a blackboard high above you
And if a shooting star goes by
I'll use the star to write " I love you"
About a million times across the sky
One thing isn't very clear, my love
Should the teacher stand so near, my love?
Graduation's almost here, my love
Come teach me tonight
