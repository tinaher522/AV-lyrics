<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="Say_Maybe">
Why make me plead
For what I need
And I need you
Why, why make me weep
Cry in my sleep
Cause I need you
Say maybe
Won't you even say sometime, baby
Won't you say lovin' words again
Say baby
Don't you know I'm a fool about you
If I tried, I could live without you
For maybe a day (maybe a day)
I, I've been around
Finally found
And I need you
And I, I know what I got
And I got a lot
But baby I need you
