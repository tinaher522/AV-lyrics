<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="Rudolph_The_Red-Nosed_Reindeer">
Hello boys and girls
I got a story to tell you
about an unlikely hero
Dig it
Rudolph the red nose reindeer
Had a very shiny nose
And if you ever saw it
You would even say it glowed
All of the other reindeer
Used to laugh and call him names
They never let poor Rudolph
Join in any reindeer games
Then one foggy Christmas Eve
Santa came to say
"Rudolph with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?"
Then how the reindeer loved him,
As they shouted out with glee
"Rudolph the Red Nose Reindeer
You'll go down in history!"
Yes you will
Yes you will
And just remember all you kids out there
If the other kids laugh at you
Just cause you're a little different
Hey, you could be just like Rudolph
A hero some day
An inspiration
You'll remember that now, won't you
C'mon and sing it with me
Rudolph the red nose reindeer,
Had a very shiny nose,
And if you ever saw it,
You would even say it glowed.
All of the other reindeer,
Used to laugh and call him names.
They never let poor Rudolph,
Join in any reindeer games.
Then one foggy Christmas Eve,
Santa came to say
"Rudolph with your nose so bright
Why don't you guide my sleigh tonight?"
Then how the reindeer loved him
As they shouted out with glee
"Rudolph the Red Nose Reindeer
You'll go down in history!"
Yes you will
Yeah you will, Rudolph
You're a part of history now
And you can do it to boys and girls
Just be yourself
That's usually enough
Don't worry what people say
You know you're kinda terrific inside
Hey and by the way
Have a Happy Christmas
Come on now
Be a hero
Just like Rudolph
An inspiration
Just like Rudolph
Hey we love you Rudy
