<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="Long_Nights,_Hold_On">
New York City is the loneliest town
Unless you happen to be lost in L.A.
But nothing matters much
When you're not around
Long nights, hold on
Long nights, hold on
I've been a traveler
And I've lived in a cave
It doesn't matter
When there's someone who cares
But you're alone now
And you've got to be brave
Long nights, hold on
Long nights, hold on
Why am I awake at night?
What good does it do
Close my eyes and all I see is you
But New York City is a happening town
And L.A. still can wear a smile on her face
Wait till morning and you turn it around
Long nights, hold on
Long nights, hold on
Why am I awake at night?
What good does it do
Close my eyes and all I see is you
But New York City can be happy at times
You only need to have somebody you love
Give me love and I'm doin' just fine
Long nights, hold on
Long nights. hold on
Long nights, hold on
Long nights, hold on
