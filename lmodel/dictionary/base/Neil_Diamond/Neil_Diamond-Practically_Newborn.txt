<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="Practically_Newborn">
Runnin', hidin'
Runnin', hidin' myself
From a bad and sad kinda hurt
It ain't gonna work, oh no
Alibi'n
I've been tryin' to make believe
I could leave love alone
Heart made of stone
Take love, why not
Give all the love that I got
But I never could before
You opened up, my door
Practically newborn,
Least that's the way I feel
Practically newborn,
I got me somethin' real
Anything you want,
Baby, you know I'll do
Yeah
Practically newborn,
Practically born for you
Me, I found me
Me, I found me a road
Take me out of my doubt and my fears
I said goodbye to tears
Stay around me, baby
Stay around me when I can't forget
What I let get me down
Look what I've found
Take love, why not
Give all the love that I got
I never could
before you opened up my door
Practically newborn,
Least that's the way I feel
Practically newborn,
I got me somethin' real
Anything you want,
Baby, you know I'll do
Yeah
Practically newborn,
Practically born for you.
Practically newborn,
least that's the way I feel
Practically newborn,
I got me somethin' real
Anything you want,
baby, you know I'll do
Yeah
Practically newborn,
practically born for you
