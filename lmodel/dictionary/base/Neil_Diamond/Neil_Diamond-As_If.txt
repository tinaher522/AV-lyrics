<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="As_If">
It was more than a matter of knowin'
Or the words that were finally said
It was more than the comin' or goin'
Or the things that were made in your head
It was more than a matter of wantin'
And needin' the foolish things I gave
As if I ever cared to make you cry
Could've been right to know that it was't
Yet you knew I was sorry
I dared to make you cry
As if I would
As if I could
As if I tried
But the words that were finally spoken
Like the thoughts that remain in my soul
And hearts that were finally broken
And embrace that never be hold
And the words that I never told you
But I told you, the foolish things I said
As if I ever cared to make you cry
I could've been right to know that I wasn't
Yet you knew that I was sorry
I dared to make you cry
As if I would
As if I could
As if I tried
As if I ever cared to make you cry
I could've been right to know that I wasn't
Yet you knew that I was sorry
I dared to make you cry
Could have been strong but the words didn't rhyme
And the things that would come between us
