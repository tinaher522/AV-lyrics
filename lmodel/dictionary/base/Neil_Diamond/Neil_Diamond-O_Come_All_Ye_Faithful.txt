<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="O_Come_All_Ye_Faithful">
O come, all ye faithful
Joyful and triumphant
Oh come ye
O come ye to Bethlehem
Come and behold him,
Born the King of angels
O come, let us adore him
O come, let us adore him
O come, let us adore him,
Christ the Lord
Adeste Fideles
Laeti triumphantes
Venite, venite in Bethlehem
Natum videte
Regem angelorum
Venite adoremus
Venite adoremus
Venite adoremus
Dominum
Sing,
Choirs of angels
Sing in exultation
Oh sing,
All ye citizens of heaven above
Glory to God in the highest
O come, let us adore him
O come, let us adore him
O come, let us adore him,
Christ the Lord.
O come, let us adore him
Christ the Lord
