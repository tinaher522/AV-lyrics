Come she come say
Ride on the night
Sun becomes day
Soolaimon
Day shall provide
Soo, soolaimon
Soolai, soolai, soolaimon
Soo, soolaimon
Soolai, soolai, soolaimon
Soo, soolaimon
Soolai, soolai, soolaimon
Lord of my want, want, want
God  of my need, need, need
Leading me on, on, on
On to my woman, she dance for the sun
Lord of my day, day, day
God of my night, night, night
Seek for the way, way, way
Taking me home and sheÂ´s calling my name

Brothers and Sisters
And little bitty children black and white
And rich and poor and great and small 
God's children all God's children sing Halleluja
And the good lord gave us two hands 
For the giving and the taking
And when your brother's hungry and ain't got what to eat
When he's tired and ain't got where to sleep
When his heart is filled with ache and the pain
And he ain't got who to cry with 
Brothers you got to take your hand and put it out to him  
Take your hand, take your hand brothers and that's for it's there for
Sing halleluja
And brothers when the morning holds only the promise of an empty day
And the day fullfills that promise 
And you got to take your other hand
Take your other hand 
Take your other hand brothers 
And put it out to the man up there 
Saying what he's there for
Halleluja
Take my hand Sweet Lord, walk with me this day
In my heart I know, I will never stray
Halle-halle-halle-halle-halle-halle-halle-halle
Pack up the babies, Grab the old Ladies
Everyone knows, Everyone knows
Brother Love's Shows
Lord of my want, Soolaimon 
God  my need, Soolamon
Leading me on,
Taking me home
Taking me home
