<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="The_Time_Is_Now">
Look at me girl,
I'm almost shakin'
I wanna hold you so bad
My insides are achin'
I wanna say what's in my heart
Like I never said it
Then I'm gonna love you ,
Girl so you won't forget it.
The time is now, and the place is here
I'm gonna show you how,
How I feel about you
You've got lips like I've never tasted
And anytime I'm not with you girl,
That's the time I call wasted
You know, we got he kind of thing
You just can't beg or borrow
Gonna show you what I mean
And I don't mean tomorrow
The time is now, and the place is here.
I'm gonna show you how,
How I feel about you.
You know, we got the kind of thing
You just can't beg or borrow
Gonna show you what I mean
And I don't mean tomorrow
And the time is now
And the place is here
I'm gonna show you how I feel, baby
I said the time is now, lady
Ah, the place, the place is here,
I'm gonna show you how...
