<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="Summerlove">
Summer love
They call it summer love
But oh, how it feels
And I don't believe make believe
But I was a lonely boy
And you were a lonely girl
And we're together tonight
Summer love made it right
Summer love
They called it summer love
But some how it's real
Could see by that look in your eyes
That you were a lonely girl
And I was a lonely boy
And when the evening was done
Summer love made us one
I don't believe make believe
But I was a lonely boy
And you were a lonely girl
And when the evening was done
Summer love made us one.
I was a lonely boy
And you were a lonely girl
But we're together tonight
We're together tonight
Summer love
Summer love made us one.....
