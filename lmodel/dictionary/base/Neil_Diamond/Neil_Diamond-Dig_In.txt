<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="Dig_In">
Dig in, Papa's comin' home
Dig in girl, Papa's comin' home
You know that soon, girl
We'll be makin' up for time
I've been gone
Hang loose,
Papa's on his way
Hang loose child,
Papa's on his way
And when I get to you,
I'll give you everything
Every day
Dig in, I say, dig in, girl
Anyway, come on,
Come on, come on
Sing out, Papa's comin' home
Sing out child,
Papa's comin' home
Gonna make some time
For givin' you girl
Every little thing you want
Oh dig in
Go, I say dig in
Do it baby
Anyway I say
Oh come on
Dig in, hang loose, sing out
