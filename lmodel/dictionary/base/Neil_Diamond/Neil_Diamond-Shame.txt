(Check it out
I'm a little man
But you're my woman
And together we'll be strong)
The end of the road, is lonesome and cold
Ain't no place for making a stand
I got too much of you on my mind
Too much time on my hands
Some people say there just ain't no way
We can hold on and see this thing thru
I don't care what they say
They never loved one like you
Shame, it comes in every size
Touches many lives
Knocks on many doors
Shame, I've seen it in your eyes
Hurt you with their lies
But words don't count at all
Because I don't care what they say
There ain't no shame in loving you
I remember the day that I drove you away
Lord that whistle gave a lonesome moan
The train that took you away
Is gonna bring you back home
And I'll be standing right there in the cold mornng air
When that train comes a rolling in
Knowing, once you're back in my arms
You won't be leaving again
Shame, it comes in every size
Touches many lives
Knocks on many doors
Shame, I've seen it in your eyes
They'll hurt you with their lies
But their words don't count at all
Because I don't care what they say
There ain't no shame in loving you
No, I don't care what they say
There ain't no shame in loving you
Me, I don't care what they say
There ain't no shame in loving you
