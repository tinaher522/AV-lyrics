She said, "It's time to teach you the art of love."
She said, "We're gonna reach to the heart of love.
A place you never knew.
A place that lives somewhere inside of you."
I know I'm on a journey I won't forget
I know I had it in me to give and yet
I never could before
I had to if I wanted to be yours
You made me see I'd have to be a brand new man
He lives in me, so here in me is where I began
You showed the kind of lesson I can't erase
You showed a way to get from that lonely place
To where love comes alive
And you'd be waiting there when I arrived
The truth was clear
Love's not a place you go to find
It lives in here
Just leave it space and give it time
I learned that I could stumble and maybe fall
I learned in being humble I'd have it all
A brand new way to live
That love's not what you have but what you give
And the art of love is who you share it with
