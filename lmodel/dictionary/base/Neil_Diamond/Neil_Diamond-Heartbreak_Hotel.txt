<song artist="Neil_Diamond" title="Heartbreak_Hotel">
Now, since my baby left me
I've found a new place to dwell
Down at the end of lonely street
At heartbreak hotel
I get so lonely, baby, I get so lonely
I get so lonely, I could die
Although it's always crowded
You still can find some room
For broken hearted lovers
To cry away their gloom
I get so lonely, baby, I get so lonely
I get so lonely, I could die
The bell hop's tears keep flowing
The desk clerk's dressed in black
They've been so long lonely street
They will never go back
I get so lonely, baby, I get so lonely
I get so lonely, I could die
So if your baby leaves you and you have a tale to tell
Just take a walk down lonely street to heartbreak hotel
I get so lonely, baby, I get so lonely
I get so lonely, I could die
